[01:06:05] <twb> Nowadays at least 50% of the time I just use busybox vi though, because it's always there
[01:06:39] <Harzilein> i don't remember if mg allowed for inserting command output (or files even, for that matter)
[01:06:41] <dragestil> interesting. i don't really need dired in one off edits though

[01:09:04] <edrx> btw
[01:09:31] <edrx> I used zsh for everything for ages, only used other shells very occasionally
[01:09:52] <dragestil> why
[01:10:24] <Harzilein> oh, just remembered how i switched here... the general problem is likely a newbie faq, still...
[01:10:31] <edrx> and only started using eshell for non-trivial things a few weeks ago - and I noticed that the default behavior of echo in eshell is to NOT add a newline to its output
[01:11:20] <technomancy> edrx: yeah that's really stupid, agreed
[01:11:28] <Harzilein> i recently wanted to edit an srt subtitle file. while SRecode mode seemed benign, i don't want it to auto activate based on the srt template extension. is there a generic way i can inspect/change that mapping?
[01:12:36] <edrx> technomancy: I was going to ask is this behavior is allowed by POSIX or something like that... and I checked the manpage for echo here to see if there are command-line options for "no newline" and "yes newline"

[07:17:25] <parsnip> oh, not in 10mins from now
[07:17:41] <parsnip> you mean when the emacsconf happens, your talk is 10 minus
[07:18:10] <codingquark> I'm thinking of showing it off as "all those repositories like elpa, melpa and nongnu elpa, forget about them! This is better, easy and fun!"
[07:18:10] <Sketch> "prior art. i was a microphone first."?
[07:18:26] <codingquark> parsnip: yes, it is a 10min talk

[07:24:02] <parsnip> codingquark: what's your plan currently?
[07:24:39] <edrx> good question... from the material in emacscollective/borg I don't know what to comment
[07:24:48] <codingquark> parsnip: explain "why" of doing it, and basics of setting it up and installing one package.
[07:25:23] <parsnip> that sounds like a good skeleton, i'll think for a sec if i can think of anything

[07:25:55] <codingquark> package installation should cover basic APIs. I'll include some deeper things such as having to modify .gitmodules to install vterm and lsp-mode for example
[07:26:20] <parsnip> i saw an emacs video recently, where the person decided to delete an earlier recording where they explained things, and tried instead to emphasize just doing
[07:26:33] <parsnip> possibly you could keep the "why" brief?
[07:27:29] <parsnip> like, you could even avoid mentioning package.el, i guess
[07:27:32] <edrx> suggestion: show a bit of how borg is implemented! I hate talks that are just "for users"... but I am a weirdo who needs to always have mental models of the innards... 
[07:27:43] <codingquark> parsnip: good idea. Instead of saying things, I could simply do "to install markdown-mode, first, let's do M-x epkg-describe-package <RET> markdown-mode"
[07:27:55] <edrx> (that's why I find Python incredibly hard to learn)
[07:28:26] <codingquark> This will give me a small window to show why it is important to inspect packages and their dependencies
[07:28:50] <codingquark> edrx: hmm, I need to see if this can be done in 10min!
[07:28:57] *** Joins: taiju (~taiju@m014013236064.v4.enabler.ne.jp)
[07:28:59] <parsnip> edrx: perhaps i can related, sometimes i use "how it works" as useful mnemonics, or a material to learn by repeated referral
[07:29:08] <parsnip> s/related/relate/
[07:29:49] <edrx> you can do that in two slides shown very quickly and say "for more on this see the git repo" =)
[07:30:02] <codingquark> Actually, would it make sense if I say "borg adds everything as gitsubmodules, uses make files to set things up and adds the submodules to your load path"?
[07:30:23] <codingquark> Now this is not innards, but still says how it works at a very high level
[07:30:44] <parsnip> high level can help people remember what's going on
[07:31:02] <parsnip> "tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them"
[07:31:24] <parsnip> it can be a way to organize
[07:31:36] <parsnip> as if you're zooming into details on a bulleted list
[07:31:39] * codingquark takes notes
[07:32:04] <parsnip> it's a somewhat famous quote, probably some mathematician
[07:32:33] <piyo> Feynmnan
[07:32:33] <parsnip> huh, maybe started at Aristotle
[07:32:52] <parsnip> but if Feynman said it too, good company
[07:33:29] <parsnip> people will only remember the first thing you said or the last thing you said
[07:34:37] <codingquark> ha ha
[07:34:42] <parsnip> "borg leverages git submodules with makefiles, and updates your emacs load-path"
[07:34:44] <piyo> science communicator
[07:35:53] <parsnip> "borg is an emacs package manager implemented as a simple wrapper around git submodules and makefiles"
[07:36:17] <codingquark> parsnip: you know this feeling that when you begin planning, the time limit feels too short. Then after a bit of preparation, it feels a bit too long. Then when you're about to present, it again seems too short
[07:36:26] <parsnip> :)
[07:36:26] <edrx> my advisor once told me that in practically all cases people attending mathematical talks only learn new things during three minutes
[07:36:42] <codingquark> edrx: first 3 min?
[07:36:47] <parsnip> yeah most people won't "hear" all of it
[07:37:02] <parsnip> if you have material for them to skim ahead of time, it could help
[07:37:05] <piyo> people can only keep about 7 things in their heads, or so they say
[07:37:07] <parsnip> will you make slides available?
[07:37:09] <edrx> the tree minutes after the things that they know well and before the things that are too advanced
[07:37:12] <codingquark> parsnip: yes
[07:37:27] <codingquark> org-mode text, to be precise
[07:37:34] <parsnip> let them read it ahead of time... "the second teacher was much better"
[07:37:35] <edrx> and for different people these three minutes will be different parts of the talk
[07:37:45] <parsnip> "the second time i took the class, the teacher was way better"
[07:37:55] <codingquark> parsnip: okay, that sounds like a good idea too
[07:38:34] <parsnip> surely there are a lot of "different learners" in the emacs community
[07:38:40] <codingquark> edrx: very interesting
[07:40:19] <codingquark> hmm, I did not realise it was such a short time of about 3min that people actually pay attention
[07:40:49] <parsnip> i think that just means, don't get too deep
[07:40:55] <codingquark> Yes
[07:41:08] <parsnip> like, someone should be able to get distracted, look back up, and still kinda follow what you're saying
[07:41:21] <edrx> codingquark: that's for talks on mathematics, that are incredibly dense
[07:41:23] <codingquark> Since it is 10min total length, 30% of the way they're going to pay attention. That's an achievement!
[07:41:29] <parsnip> or rely on people to pay attention or read ahead
[07:42:01] <parsnip> i've had classmates that seemed to just ingest grad level lectures
[07:42:26] <codingquark> "If you did not want to learn why are you in my class?" said the professor with a stern voice
[07:43:18] <parsnip> i think i told a tenured professor once, "lectures are a joke", or something to that effect. not that i didn't attend, just that i did not at all treat as primary resource
[07:43:34] <codingquark> parsnip: remaining focused and paying attention for a long time is a skill developed by practice.
[07:43:49] <parsnip> and talent
[07:44:55] <codingquark> Oh yes, lectures, to me, are more about "I studied such and such things the other day, x of which did not make sense and I have these new thoughts. Please help!"
[07:45:04] <parsnip> codingquark: i have a particular struggle with tracking verbal, is my understanding
[07:45:17] <codingquark> I derail lectures to no end because of this approach :D
[07:46:16] <codingquark> parsnip: oh, I see. Do you mean that when someone is speaking to teach, you struggle? In what way?
[07:46:42] <codingquark> I do prefer being able to go back and forth the sections in books/text over just listening
[07:46:58] <parsnip> codingquark: my strategy through school was to have the homework done before the chapter was even being discussed
[07:47:30] <parsnip> codingquark: the only way lectures did anything for me, was if they were simply reinforcing what i had already figured out on my own
[07:47:58] <codingquark> hmm...
[07:48:15] <parsnip> and then maybe i would catch some little nuances in the way the professor explained, which i hadn't a hope of doing if i just showed up for lecture before doing reading, homework

[10:58:27] <johnjay> but i can't think of anything else that does that
[10:58:56] <johnjay> right but the idea of "include part of one file in another" doesn't seem that complicated

[10:59:22] <twb> otherwise it's a complete waste of time.  Use docstrings and comments for apologia for programmers, and an entirely separate user manual for end users.  Then the manual structure doesn't get tied to the code structure

[11:52:46] <JibStyle> After using M-x I sometimes get a message like "You can run the command ‘shr-render-buffer’ with M-x sh-r-b RET". Is there any way to proactively determine such shortcuts, for the purpose of typing less? E.g. a function that maps "shr-render-buffer" --> "sh-r-b".
[11:53:12] <pjb> aidalgol: often, projects fork for new versions, to leave the previous version alive for older systems.
[11:54:08] <pjb> aidalgol: so basically, the problem is that git doesn't reach to the releases…
[11:54:44] <edrx> JibStyle: what a coincidence!

[11:56:11] <edrx> the answer seems to be at the end of the definition of execute-extended-command

[13:58:12] <empwilli> think of car/cdr as head/tail of a list. The head is always a single element (in your case it's a list of list, thus a list) and the tail is the remaining list w/o the head

[14:07:35] <JibStyle> empwilli: It's been a few months, so I don't remember all the details, but my bank provides CSV file with recent transactions. I open that in Emacs, and have a couple Elisp functions I wrote to transform it to org table format. I have an alist of regexp --> category that I use to populate a category column based off of the description field from the CSV. In org, I use a "date tree"-like heading structure with year and month headings to
[14:07:35] <JibStyle> group by month. And a couple basic table formulas to calculate the starting and ending balance. I've never heard of ledger/beancount/firefly. I kind of just came up with this solution on my own.

[14:19:19] <JibStyle> Ok, so your Emacs installation does not have TLS support.
[14:19:49] <JibStyle> Depending how it's installed, they would need to include the TLS option.

[19:46:31] <codingquark> Right
[19:46:36] <codingquark> I don't use package.el

[19:49:12] <famubu> codingquark: sounds like something that I can benefit from.
[19:49:15] <dale> I wish I knew why Emacs occasionally thinks its frames are N columns wide when they're really <N columns wide.
[19:49:40] <thblt> dale: Something something variable pitch fonts? 
[19:50:03] <parsnip> is it off by one, or sometimes off by more than one?
[19:50:14] <thblt> Or more tortuous, some fixed-pitch font has a character or too that's not as wide as the average.
[19:50:21] <dale> thblt: Actually I don't think I use any of those.
[19:50:56] <dale> thblt: No, (window-text-width) actually reports e.g. 88 but typing 88 fixed-width default font characters wraps probably a dozen or so characters before 88.

[19:51:35] <dale> It feels like a macOS bug.  I thought I could just create a new frame and destroy the old one, but that didn't work this time.  I should look at, like, default-frame-alist next time.
[19:52:00] <dale> thblt: That's probably expected.  I wasn't using it in this case, it was a fairly fresh Emacs start.
[19:52:07] <dale> Restarting Emacs fixed it, natch.
[19:52:43] <dale> I forget exactly how Emacs decides how wide a column is, but maybe there's some race between where that gets computed and when I change default face font size or something?  Not sure.

[21:06:16] <thblt> But it *can* make sense, in some cases.
[21:07:26] <thblt> Eg I don't enable pdf-tools or AucTeX on Windows because I very rarely use Windows  and I can't be bothered to install whatever I need to install for those packages to build on Win.
[21:08:07] <johnjay> what's what i want. a single config
[21:08:22] <johnjay> i'm asking, should that config have melpa packages as part of it or is that hard to maintain
[21:08:33] <artefact> i would consider maybe a 95% common base with a per-host override
[21:08:43] <johnjay> right now i have a core init.el i use for all machines. then i just install whatever i need from melpa
[21:08:45] <thblt> OK, I misunderstood. 
[21:09:10] <johnjay> but like e.g. magit would make sense to have
[21:09:13] <thblt> I don't use Melpa for permanent stuff, just to quickly try packages because it's easier than M-x borg-clone
[21:09:14] <johnjay> because you can have git on window
[21:09:16] <artefact> overrides being simple things like "don't load mail stuff on the laptop" "don't load tex stuff on windows" etc
[21:09:44] <johnjay> artefact: so have melpa packages but check for which os before installing them?
[21:10:49] <thblt> If you want reproducibility, Melpa isn't a good choice since it only offers the latest version (but it's faster than git-based solutions)
[21:11:06] <johnjay> i don't understand. melpa just gives you git
[21:11:16] <thblt> git HEAD.
[21:11:17] <artefact> yes. so if you reinstall tomorrow you'll get tomorrow's HEADs
[21:11:24] <thblt> or most recent tag, for stable.
[21:11:41] <johnjay> ah you mean it's faster than finding each project's git page
[21:11:42] <artefact> there is melpa-stable but not all melpa packages have -stable versions (and some are too old)
[21:11:43] <johnjay> ok
[21:11:43] <thblt> So if you install on different computers you may get different version of the same package.
[21:12:11] <johnjay> that sounds like a problem with melpa. or maybe the culture of packages.
[21:12:12] <thblt> For well-behaved packages, like Magit, melpa stable is good and update frequency is slow enough.

[21:12:16] <johnjay> there's a reason debian fixes package versions
[21:12:16] <artefact> i think the namings should be reversed, melpa shoud default to tagged releases, and maybe have a melpa-nightly or a melpa-unstable for HEAD
[21:12:41] <johnjay> is that what they are called on git? a tagged release? i.e. when you click on the releases tab?
[21:12:47] <thblt> It's a tag.
[21:12:49] <johnjay> and it's like here's v1.14.myapp.zip?
[21:12:52] <artefact> technically they're just tags (annonated usually)
[21:13:02] <thblt> tagged commits, technically.
[21:13:08] <thblt> "releases" are not a git thing.
[21:13:23] <johnjay> there's a tab for it. or it's on the right
[21:13:27] <johnjay> i guess it's a github thing
[21:13:38] <thblt> yes, it's part of github. Github ≠ git.
[21:13:51] <johnjay> well. i hope you forgive me for using them interchangeably
[21:13:54] <artefact> most projects have release tags/commits, it's fairly standard git workflow. the kernel does it, for example
[21:14:03] <artefact> please don't do that
[21:14:09] <johnjay> since that is what we're talking about 90% of the tie

[23:10:37] <pjb> Note that the current buffer could have several windows, so your question is meaningless as is.
[23:10:54] *** Joins: jmd` (~user@de.cellform.com)

[23:17:37] <rdrg109> pjb: Thanks! I have read the docstring of that function, but I don't think it'll help to accomplish what I want. Basically, I want to search a string in the visible part of the window. So, let's say a file has 100000 lines, but only 10 are being shown, the search must only be done in the 10 lines being shown.
