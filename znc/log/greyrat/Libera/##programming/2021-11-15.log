[03:12:22] <dre> I mean part of it is "i want to build it" so build it anyway, but at the same time I've got to juggle priorities
[03:12:48] <dre> so if I put up some sort of landing page and gauge whether /other people/ find it useful it might give it more weight compared to others

[03:16:14] <Gamah> are double's safe from weird float behavior in c++?
[03:16:33] <flakland> no
[03:16:34] <bjs> Gamah: no, doubles are just floats but bigger
[03:16:43] <Gamah> what if i only do half values
[03:16:53] <bjs> Gamah: what is a half value?
[03:16:58] <Gamah> 0.5
[03:17:16] <bjs> Gamah: I'm not sure I understand
[03:17:40] <Gamah> is it possible to run into problems with float precision if you only use halves as the decimal
[03:18:00] <Gamah> values will only ever be between 1 and a few million whole and 0 or .5 decimal
[03:18:04] <bjs> Gamah: well it'll depend what you do with them
[03:18:11] <bjs> Gamah: oh, yes for sure
[03:18:22] <Gamah> hmmm
[03:18:32] <Gamah> soooo use int and divide by 100?
[03:18:45] <Gamah> or is there a safe, nice decimal type implementation?
[03:19:09] <InPhase> Gamah: Floats and integers fundamentally represent different types of things.
[03:19:15] <Gamah> agre
[03:19:22] <bjs> Gamah: ... nobody can answer that "divide by 100" question because it's very arbitrary and you've not actually explained what you're trying to do with these halves (and obviously if you divide to get a float you're back to square 1)
[03:19:52] <Gamah> the value of one of these vars can never be any thing besides a whole number or a whole number point 5
[03:20:01] <InPhase> Gamah: So you use floats for things that are open to the set of the reals, such as measured values.  You use integers for countable items.

[03:22:32] <vdamewood> That's an integer use case.
[03:23:05] <vdamewood> But if it's C++, you make your own type that has its own function to generate a string representation.

[03:27:26] <[itchyjunk]> right click gives me no option for delete, any ideas?
[03:27:27] <InPhase> Gamah: The quickest demonstration of a decimal type failing is with Python:  1-decimal.Decimal('1')/3*3  # This does not yield a result of 0.
[03:27:28] <Gamah> dre: ugh that sounds tedious
[03:27:35] <vdamewood> Gamah: If you're going to just add up values of this type anyway, just add up the intger values.
[03:27:50] <Gamah> coming from SQL land, it feels weird that there isn't an agreed upon usable decimal implemtation...

[04:07:16] <sonny> he's right

[04:39:04] <vdamewood> Sometimes O is used because the u form of the sylable formed is different from the consonant. For example tu is pronounced tsu instead, so they ad o after t as a separator.
[04:39:35] <sonny> good to know, ty
[04:39:39] <vdamewood> sonny: The thing is if a Japanese person tried to pronounce rikarudo, it would probably sound a lot like Ricardo as pronounced in Spanish.
[04:40:09] <vdamewood> Japanese Rs are closer to Spanish Rs than English Rs.
[04:40:13] <sonny> even rolling the R?
[04:40:33] <vdamewood> sonny: They don't roll them, so In Japanese 'pero' would sound like pero, not perro.
[04:40:44] <sonny> ah
[04:42:42] <vdamewood> sonny: so, do you speak something more Castiliano, or Andalusian/American?
[04:43:04] <sonny> nope, my father speaks spanish not I
[04:43:13] <sonny> eng, french for me
[04:43:21] <sonny> spanish seems super easy tho
[04:43:24] <vdamewood> Yeah, I thought about such a scenario like that just after posting.

[04:43:33] <sonny> no, canada

[07:22:29] <Gamah> hard to call SQL a programming language though...
[07:22:32] <arahael> Gamah: How would you use sqlite's cursors, though?
[07:22:36] <apotheon> Well . . . PostgreSQL and Oracle provide PL/pgSQL and PL/SQL, respectively, while MS SQL Server provides Transact-SQL, both of which are Turing complete programming languages that wrap SQL.  I don't know what MySQL would provide along those lines these days.  Does it just have such a mangled version of SQL itself that it's accidentally Turing complete?
[07:23:21] *** Joins: gggp (~gggp@li2010-23.members.linode.com)
[07:23:29] <arahael> ^ That.
[07:23:31] <Gamah> arahael: you can insert into the cursor iterator being worked on meaning you can revisit indicies to change the values.
[07:23:44] <apotheon> MySQL's "SQL" isn't.
[07:23:52] <arahael> Gamah: The cursor iterator?  How do you use the iterator explicitly?
[07:23:54] <Gamah> innodb isn't turing complete?
[07:24:01] <Gamah> arahael: i don't understand the question
[07:24:03] <apotheon> (isn't SQL, really, I mean)
[07:24:28] <arahael> Gamah: Show me some code - any code, using Sqlite's SQL, that demonstrates how it uses the cursors.
[07:24:35] <apotheon> Gamah: InnoDB is a storage engine, not a language.
[07:25:31] <Gamah> arahael: oh, i misread a SO post.... sqlite may not be then.. unles, does it support CTE's?
[07:25:42] <arahael> Gamah: What's a "CTE" in this context?
[07:25:46] <Gamah> CTE's allow recursion which gives you touring completeness
[07:25:49] <Gamah> common table expression
[07:27:15] <arahael> Gamah: Sure, sqlite lets you do that.
[07:27:24] <Gamah> Q.E.D sqlite is turing complete
[07:27:24] <Gamah> lol
[07:28:09] <arahael> Gamah: It's generally difficult to actually prove turing completeness. The usual solution is to implement an interpreter for a language that is known to be turing complete and run it.
[07:28:18] <arahael> Gamah: If it can be done, then it's turing complete.
[07:28:43] <Gamah> arahael: a 1 column table with type integer can be the beaver tape...
[07:29:01] <arahael> What's a "beaver type"?  You do use a lot of jargon.
[07:29:16] <Gamah> busy beaver../
[07:29:34] <arahael> Yeah?
[07:29:50] <Gamah> if you can implement busy beaver then it's turing complete
[07:29:53] <[itchyjunk]> oh ML bots are interesting
[07:30:14] <[itchyjunk]> sounds cool, but ML bots are out of my league for now
[07:30:35] <arahael> Gamah: All beavers are busy...

[07:30:52] <Gamah> ANSI sql is not turing complete
[07:31:35] <arahael> Ah, the busy beaver turing machine.  Yes, that'd work.
[07:31:46] <arahael> Thanks for that tip, beaky  :)
[07:32:22] <Gamah> arahael: sorry, i'm not being intentionally cryptic
[07:33:27] <apotheon> I'm pretty sure SQLite doesn't do Turing completeness if you *only* use its SQL.  You'd probably have to dip into its Tcl interface for Turing completeness.
[07:33:47] <Gamah> tcl?
[07:34:06] <Gamah> i'm pretty sure CTE's allow turing 
[07:34:12] <apotheon> It's a programming language highly prized by the SQLite creator.

[08:08:03] <InPhase> Gamah: Actually, definitionally, current is the rate of flow of charges themselves.  So it is not the current itself that goes near the speed of light, but a wave front signal that propagates down the line of electrons allow fast electrical signal propagation while the current itself is in fact slow.  The behavior becomes intuitively deceptive because that wave front propagation causes additional

[14:04:25] <dan01[m]> I have a question about threads in programming
[14:04:56] <dan01[m]> So you have on process that can have multiple execution threads, that share the same address space 
[14:05:23] <dan01[m]> There threads, are they somehow realated to CPU threads? Like if you say you have a 4 core CPU with 8 threads?
[14:05:30] <dan01[m]> There/These
[14:05:57] <pyzozord> not really, those are software threads
[14:06:13] <pyzozord> when they say 4 core cpu with 8 threads they mean "hyperthreading"
[14:06:13] <arahael> dan01[m]: Depends on the language and threading model, but it's more complicated, yeah, as pyzozord implies.
[14:06:13] <dan01[m]> What's the relationship between software threads and CPU threads?
[14:06:19] <merijn> CPUs don't have threads
[14:06:19] <Twix> but the operating system can decide to let them run on different CPU Threads at the same time
[14:06:21] <merijn> They have cores
[14:07:13] <arahael> merijn: In modern times, it's so vague. :(  Even the intel CPU specs list threads.
[14:07:27] <dan01[m]> merijn: Well CPU's also have threads, think of Intel's hyper-threading, I mean a 4 CORE  CPU shows 8 Cores in System Monitor because the other 4 are virtual Cores, aka hardware threads
[14:07:32] <Twix> <merijn> CPUs don't have threads <-- There are hardware threads. Modern CPU Cores execute multible threads at the same time
[14:07:48] <Twix> intel calls this hyper threading
[14:07:51] <pyzozord> "hyperthreading" is a fancy cpu technology that can allow a single core two jobs at the same time. With the caveat *some* two jobs, and *sometimes*
[14:08:07] <arahael> Twix: merijn knows this.
[14:08:29] <dan01[m]> Ok, leaving that terminology behind, I was reading about the Go programming language that Go routines run on one thread 
[14:08:42] <dan01[m]> Like WTF, now you have processes, threads, and Go routines?
[14:09:10] <Twix> yeah, you can have threads which are managed in userspace
[14:09:42] <Twix> less context switches, because its not the OS that interrupts
[14:09:59] <pyzozord> those are "coroutines". Imagine a a cog wheel. Now imagine multiple cog wheels turning together. If one stops, all stop. If one turns, all trun. Those are coroutines. They all together can run on a single thread
[14:10:18] <merijn> pyzozord: That's an oversimplification, though
[14:10:55] <pyzozord> seemed the question asker was focused on the fundamental concepts
[14:11:12] <merijn> Twix: I mean, "thread" is just a software abstraction. Hyperthreading is less "threads" and more "we doubled the registers in the core so we can instantly context switch without all the normal cost"
[14:11:15] <pyzozord> merijn: but I'd like to learn more for my own sake if you care to elaborate

[14:11:41] *** Joins: rany (~rany@user/rany)
[14:12:04] <merijn> pyzozord: So, normally if you a core switches to execute another thread, you would have to save all the registers and process state before you loud the state of the new thread you wanna run
[14:12:22] <pyzozord> yep
[14:12:27] <Twix> Yes, its threads with hardware support
[14:12:56] <pyzozord> merijn: but the last question was about goroutines, which aren't threads
[14:12:56] <Twix> the os does not need to do stuff to implement them
[14:13:07] <merijn> pyzozord: The basic idea behind SMT (aka hyperthreading) "well, if we just double the CPU registers we can keep the state for *two* threads, and instantly switch" which in turn means you can switch at the hardware level when your pipeline stalls (rather then just when the OS switches the threads)

[14:57:38] <pyzozord> so I looked at php7 and php8 and now I have a feeling that all languages seem to be trying to converge into a single superlanguage

[14:59:47] <pyzozord> ah yes, that too
[15:00:46] <Flonk> ?? and await are monadic-like operators so slowly we are converging to haskell, clearly
[15:01:51] <pyzozord> monads scare me :(
[15:02:13] <sjmulder> hunter-gatherers scare me
[15:02:34] <deniska> they are like railway tracks, or burritos, or something like that
[15:02:35] <pyzozord> I feel like I first need to understand category theory, set theory, group theory, computational theory, language theory and something more
[15:02:37] <Flonk> They're easy but Haskell has a tendency to overcomplicate things :P
[15:02:42] <pyzozord> probably a monad theory, I bet there is one
[15:03:09] <Flonk> yyeeeeah exactly
[15:03:20] <DnzAtWrk> does anyone know what specific action when typing emails in outlook 365 which causes popups to appear
[15:03:44] <deniska> pyzozord: I mean, you don't need to know category theory to use integers
[15:03:44] <Flonk> You could just say a monad is a C# interface with 3 specific methods or something but category theory sounds fancier
[15:03:58] <deniska> pyzozord: even though they are subject to its research
[15:04:36] <deniska> pyzozord: it could have another name, like "composable" or something, haskell just chose the scientific name for it
[15:04:46] <deniska> kinda how some languages call floats reals
[15:05:00] <pyzozord> oh, "composable" sounds so much better
[15:05:07] <pyzozord> it actually conveys information
[15:05:52] <pyzozord> "monad" on wiktionary is "An ultimate atom, or simple, unextended point; something ultimate and indivisible."
[15:05:59] <pyzozord> I didn't even know it was a real word
[15:06:14] <deniska> haskell deals with many different types which could roughly be described as "composable", and it's strongly typed, so it should use words even if they are meaningless
[15:06:25] <deniska> or, well, don't convey meaning to an average person
[15:06:26] <sjmulder> pyzozord, that sounds like an exact synonym for atom then
[15:06:32] <Flonk> I think monads have a maths meaning outside of functional programming / cat theory just to add to the confusion
[15:07:33] <pyzozord> sjmulder: there is also explanation for category theory: "A monoid object in the category of endofunctors of a fixed category." - Now I know everything. So obvious. it's an object in cateogry of endofunctors!

[15:14:58] <arahael> SOLID is awesome.
[15:15:03] <deniska> extends BaseService, of course
[15:15:50] <pyzozord> arahael: SOLID is not measurable, it's a tradition
[15:16:38] <pyzozord> and I find it is often used as a free ticket for overengineering
[15:17:18] <deniska> I became a really strong proponent of an aggressively straightforward code
[15:17:18] <arahael> pyzozord: If anything, I use SOLID as an argument against needless extending.
[15:17:34] <deniska> If I have to look in another file to know what a function is doing, there better be a good reason for it
[15:18:06] <arahael> deniska: Here, we play "guess where the extension lives".
[15:18:10] <pyzozord> deniska: yes, me too. Make more concrete code, less abstraction

[15:26:23] <pyzozord> yeah, abstraction can reduce complexity when applied well

[15:31:00] <pyzozord> as far as I can see it's essentially streaming binary blobs over http

[18:05:37] <[itchyjunk]> environment
[18:06:26] <CalimeroTeknik> do you intend a specific meaning by that?
[18:06:28] <makersmasher> shells is program, env is the global vars for that running program
[18:06:32] <piou> [itchyjunk]: the shell is what interprets commands, the environment generally refers to the set of global variables available to a given process, here what reads the file is the shell, it's not defined by an env variable (unless you're using an exotic shell that does that I guess)
[18:06:37] <[itchyjunk]> nope, i don't
[18:06:44] <CalimeroTeknik> makersmasher, we don't know what "environment" was supposed to mean to [itchyjunk]

[18:07:07] <[itchyjunk]> nm the env part of it
[18:07:41] <CalimeroTeknik> well, "shell" is defined, "environment" in the sense you mean is pretty vague, it could account for the specific kernel you run, binaries available in $PATH and other stuff
[18:07:57] <piou> There are some cases where I think you'd prefer cat over <, for example to read some special files where cat may have more optimized reading (since GNU cat for example defines quite a few caching strategies for special files etc IIRC)

[18:42:12] <Atque> Decker: JavaScript objects aren't really C++ objects. JavaScript runtimes might sometimes be written in C++, but the languages are extremely different and so are the object lifecycles.
[18:42:28] <nomagno> merjin: I am talking about procedural as a paradigm, not programming languages
[18:42:34] <merijn> nomagno: So earlier today someone here linked a high level diagram of modern Intel CPUs, which is very enlightening

[18:42:38] <bayaz> Type: image/svg+xml 
[18:42:43] <Decker> Atque the existance of the object life cycle is managed by C++ code nto JS code
[18:42:51] <Decker> JS doesn't garbage collece JS
[18:43:04] <merijn> nomagno: The point is that assembly instructions don't remotely get executed "sequentially" anymore on modern machines
[18:43:09] <Decker> so... you're right - JS has no say about any of that and it's only C++ that doe sit?
[18:43:14] <Decker> entirely different
[18:43:36] <merijn> nomagno: So translating a procedural language to a "procedural sequence of assembly" seems really straightforward (and it is), but that's not *remotely* how that assembly ends up running on the CPU
[18:43:42] <nomagno> merjin: speculative execution and multi threading don't actually change my point, that's just implementation details
[18:43:47] <merijn> Which has rather crucial performance impact

[18:45:11] <Decker> I thought you might get the idea

[18:45:45] <bjs> nomagno: well,  how computers really do things is nothing like any of our high level languages really
[18:45:47] <merijn> nomagno: See, that's even weirder, because at the hardware/ALU level circuits *are* functional
[18:45:49] <Decker> it's interpreted :)
[18:46:08] <Decker> and it's a whitespace significant language - which prevents arbitrary formatting
[18:46:10] <merijn> In the sense that they provide a mapping of input signals to output signals
[18:46:17] <Atque> Functional programming is fun. Imperative is so blase. :(
[18:46:33] <bjs> nomagno: because "how a computer does things" is a huge stack of different paradigms and different languages.  People like to pick one particular level and go "Look! See?" but ignore the 10 layers above and below them that are different
[18:46:49] <CoderGuy> okay I need someone to talk some sense into me, sooo currently i'm using a framework where everything gets styled based on the style inputs BUT the behaviour I want style wise doesn't really exist because they don't factor in position to resizing an element, so what I want to do is basically add a function for each object when it adds an element to resize, is this okay?
[18:46:51] <merijn> bjs: Disagree, I would argue what computers do is very much functional. As evidenced by tools like Clash :)
[18:46:54] <Decker> and it's another pretyped langauge everything you do you have to do double the effor for
[18:47:02] <nomagno> Egh, machine code is mostly procedural in nature isn't it? That was what I meant
[18:47:19] <Decker> merijn it's really not :) 
[18:47:42] <Decker> what they get used for is sequential and funcitonal
[18:47:51] <nomagno> you can fit any paradigm into any other paradigm with enough work
[18:47:51] <kek_> hi, I'm trying to implement a neural network. The first few layers are described here: https://i.imgur.com/FCFb216.png Now I want to use torch.nn.Conv1d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size,...) for that but I have no idea how to read the image. It says the size of the 2nd layer (conv1d) is 32x40945 and the sie of the 3th layer (pooling) is 32x10236. What is now in_channels, out_channels and kernel_size exactly? Note that in 
[18:47:51] <kek_> and out channels are integeres.

[18:47:54] <bjs> nomagno: i wouldn't say procedural (procedures are a bit high-level for machine code, although they often do have some support for call/return and stacks)
[18:47:54] <Decker> but at the lowest level paralell architecture is noce..
[18:48:04] <merijn> Decker: At the hardware description level it's all functional
[18:48:15] <bjs> nomagno: but yeah, the interface between you and the hardware is fairly imperative.  That's not to say the actual implementation is ...
[18:48:28] <Decker> but then I've been using threads in C naturally for so long, it's actually nice to not worry about other threads being able to change things in JS.  Still get workers that are real parallel threads.
[18:48:28] <Atque> Decker: Hmm... depends on the runtime. cpython compiles to a bytecode language, which the cpython runtime consumes. ironpython compiles to .net. jython to java etc. I think you can go native with llvm, but I have not tried that.
[18:48:32] <Decker> they get their own machine
[18:48:35] <CoderGuy> so for example a stylesheet might be like "min-width:200px;"   but then when you add an element so widget.add(otherwidget); the width gets resized but somewhere in the framework, so I want to essentially add a function right there to resize based on the position as well, is this okay?
[18:48:52] <merijn> bjs: Lots of programmers seem to have a very hard time distinguishing semantics from implementation
[18:48:53] <nomagno> I didn't say the implementation is anything. Didn't correctly define what I meant by "the metal", I guess

[18:50:13] <CoderGuy> in case one wanted to move something but not resize the parent width
[18:50:39] <Decker> it's knida like ld scripts - if you were a posix fanatic/guru
[18:50:41] <Atque> Decker: There isn't really a widely distributed python tbh... need to target specific platform and version. pypy is very widely used.
[18:51:05] <Decker> Atque and even when it is you have to lookup 'python install pip' which is an extra search for 'python'

[19:01:20] <nomagno> Memory safety is nice, but I reject all languages currently competing to be "Memory safe C" at the moment for various reasons, namely being too bloatly and lacking a spec
[19:01:23] <Atque> Decker: Development teams usually have loads of junior people in them. Limiting the opportunity for security issues and mistakes is a big deal.

[19:02:36] <CalimeroTeknik> nomagno, you're not wrong in rejecting stuff that tries to be C (like golang and so many others) in my opinion, but I wonder, do you have a reasoning behind that or even are you thinking of something else?
[19:02:36] <Atque> CalimeroTeknik: Yeah, I think C is quite hard to develop in, compared to rust, C#, Java and what not. It's easier to do things that create risk or suck up everyone's time.
[19:02:45] *** Joins: jamea (~jamea@200.68.140.6)
[19:02:55] <Decker> Atque but if you put your development in something that has training wheels - it's not as simple as just takig those off later... Typescript would be a better alternative than python - but it's new... and doesn't really have momentum
[19:03:15] <Decker> Rust does seem to have an interesting model 
[19:03:21] <Atque> nomagno: That's true, but I think those still can't stand up to debugging C# or Java code.
[19:03:46] <CalimeroTeknik> Atque, in general, defining a (non-leaky) language where anything either has meaning, or does not compile, (therefore no undefined behaviour) implies memory safety, I think
[19:03:47] <Decker> Though it again really seems too restrictive - not worth the work to try and fold in the wings at this point.
[19:03:49] <Atque> Decker: Typescript is not very popular.
[19:03:55] <nomagno> Rust is fairly good at competing against C++
[19:04:24] <nomagno> But if their feature release schedule continues, it's going to blow C out of the water 12 times by this time in 3 years

[19:06:54] <Decker> Atque well... that's becaues it's around the JS community that already deals with just knowing the types of things, without having to spell it out ahead of time.... so it's alot of extra work to go to TS: but there is a slow migration, I mean if it's just recompiling to JS anyway do you really need the extra abstraction?  (yes, in the argument of junior assistants and code-completion stuff)
[19:06:55] <CalimeroTeknik> nomagno, leaky you mean? C is
[19:07:07] <Decker> (assistance :/ )
[19:07:15] <CalimeroTeknik> nomagno, JS isn't leaky though :)
[19:07:25] <Atque> CalimeroTeknik: Yeah, malloc() and C's string mechanics have created a lot of security issues I guess. In Javascript, you don't have those mechanics.

[19:11:18] <CalimeroTeknik> Atque, yes, in language design, you provide the programmer with access to ONE layer of abstraction, that of your syntax and semantics, and no possibility to touch the memory directly (for the parts that implement the abstraction)

[19:12:00] <CalimeroTeknik> if like C you can actually go trample anywhere in memory that's, I don't know, program code or malloc markers, it's leaky abstraction, because you can't provide two mechanisms to touch the same memory

[19:15:51] <CalimeroTeknik> what do types have to do with leaky abstraction?
[19:16:25] <Decker> what is abstraction? then? and what leaks?
[19:16:35] <Decker> if it's not memory, nad it's not information?
[19:16:45] <Decker> and if it is information - what information
[19:16:51] <Atque> CalimeroTeknik: I don't think the way you're framing those criteria are practical tbh. GNU assembly is nice to  learn and play with, but writing anything nontrivial in it clear takes longer in most cases. In my view, a language should let you develop quickly, minimise mistakes and security risks and not drive developers mad. Leakiness seems a bit abstract.
[19:17:17] <nomagno> CalimeroTeknik: I'm sorry but that is just wrong. Malloc in C is specifically a function to request for the OS to give you some memory until you stop needing it. I don't think there is actually any difference between mallocing memory and defining static variables. It is just equivalent ways of assigning memory, just malloc is byte-by-byte and static is typesize-by-typesize

[19:17:48] <CalimeroTeknik> Decker, for example, Lisp/scheme is an abstract language, which has no leaky abstraction semantics; it's a clean abstract language (which you can implement on a machine)
[19:17:56] <nomagno> That disctinction is not really useful IMHO
[19:17:58] <Decker> the OS is actually uhmm... VirtuaalAlloc in windows - mmap? 
[19:18:17] <Decker> malloc is a higher level abstraction in the c runtime library
[19:18:31] <Decker> like FILE* on the int handle from the OS
[19:18:38] <CalimeroTeknik> nomagno, my point is one of properties of programming language, implementation details are completely unrelated
[19:19:32] <nomagno> CalimeroTeknik: that distinction doesn't say ANYTHING about portability.
[19:19:52] <CalimeroTeknik> nomagno, my point is that you need to remove reading from memory addresses that can be accessed by the programmer as values from C to make it non-leaky, because you can't touch memory through both utilities and directly by hand (that's bound to cause problems)
[19:20:22] <CalimeroTeknik> portability is actually assured if you define a language that doesn't care what machine it will run on
[19:20:39] <CalimeroTeknik> and it is necessary to NOT expose any machine details to the programmer for that purpose

[19:22:41] <CalimeroTeknik> of course you can: find out the address, dereference, do everything you want

[22:31:20] <bjs> sonny: I just explained...  Python is currently a grammar file written in (some dialect of) PEG.  But you *could* have written in in this other style as Python code as parser combinators
[22:31:23] <nomagno> Basically, RPython is a Python subset that makes guarantees about static analysis, so it can be easily transpiled into most any strongly typed languages

[23:07:16] <blahboybaz> I thought it would break out of the function after executing an if statement (thus never executing the return in that case)
[23:07:16] <pyzozord> you don't literally change the function you actually create a new function and change the name grumpySum to point to the new function
[23:07:30] <pyzozord> the old function still exists in that last call until it is being executed
[23:08:00] <Decker> it changes the function, but while it's in the function it's not calling tiself, it doesn't like phase into the new relaity of that new function 
[23:08:26] <pyzozord> it doesn't really change the function, functions are immutable objects
[23:08:50] <pyzozord> but it makes the name grumpySum refer to the new function
[23:09:03] <pyzozord> but the old function (now nameless) will be executed until the return
[23:09:27] <pyzozord> and then since it's nameless and nobody points to it, it will never be executed again and garbage-collected
[23:10:48] <blahboybaz> I guess I have a different understanding of how conditionals work or maybe this has nothing to do with conditional statement. The metaphor I've been using to understand an if statement is like a fork in the road - if you want x then go down this branch if you want outcome y go down this branch - like if you were walking down the sidewalk and came to a fork in the road. Whatever input (equal to 
[23:10:54] <blahboybaz> 'choice') is what determines what fork of the road you go down.
[23:11:32] <sonny> ok, I don't need then as inputs, I need the state machines in a heirachy
[23:11:59] <sonny> woot
[23:12:02] <blahboybaz> pyzozord: by new function are you referring to the if statement?
[23:12:23] <pyzozord> the person who swapped the sign pointing from left side of the fork to right side of the fork still goes the left side
[23:12:41] <pyzozord> the next person after them who doesnt know the sign was swapped will go to the right
[23:13:11] <blahboybaz> I see it
[23:13:20] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: yes inside that if you create a new function and assign it to the old name
[23:13:21] <blahboybaz> thanks for getting me to look closer
[23:13:42] <blahboybaz> yes, it's because of what is being executed inside the if statement
[23:13:49] <apotheon> pyzozord: I get news from people on IRC talking about it, then looking up information about it separately, sometimes through Tor.
[23:14:00] <blahboybaz> it isn't simply returning zero it is rewriting the function the if statement is in
[23:14:31] <sonny> #j ##economics
[23:15:09] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: correct, after the new function is created there is no return so it continues down the normal return
[23:15:23] <pyzozord> blahboybaz: no problem you are my first chance to be actually useful today :P
[23:16:30] <blahboybaz> actually it doesn't just return zero once after getting that input > 5 it keeps returning zero cause it rewrote itself to do that
[23:16:40] <blahboybaz> really interesting concept!
[23:16:41] <pyzozord> yes
[23:16:51] <pyzozord> yeah it's quite funny

[23:51:10] <nomagno> flakland: This basically tells the prepocessor to take name, and paste it as a suffix
[23:51:13] <user51> what did you want to say about awk yesterday?

[23:51:54] <flakland> oh man i didn't even know that was possible
[23:52:38] <Decker> well ## is paste
[23:52:46] <Decker> #thing is get the string
[23:52:47] <flakland> well i didn't know it was possible
[23:52:48] <nomagno> flakland: `#define FooToken(Bar) Foo_##Bar\n int FooToken(Variable) = 0; //completely equivalent to int Foo_Variable = 0`
[23:52:51] <nomagno> Yeah paste

[23:54:03] <Decker> #define prt(f,...) printf( "%s(%d):" f, __FILE__, __LINE__ ,##__VA_ARGS__ )   
[23:54:16] <Decker> in that case when va-args is blank, pasting with ',' deletes the ','

[23:56:15] <apotheon> I do recall it was kind of a question of choosing betweek awk and Python.
[23:56:27] <apotheon> What purposes do you have in mind for the language you use?
[23:56:33] <apotheon> (out of those two)
[23:56:44] <apotheon> The determining factor should probably be your use case(s).

[23:58:03] <nomagno> Had Perl appeared a few years earlier, it would definitely be a partly standardized POSIX utility
[23:58:15] <droid3> hey guys i realize you can now raise bignumbers to rational powers using mpmath. You not only can do things like 3424242.34242**integer but you can now do things to 234242.3424**rational powers.
[23:58:31] <droid3> Using imported python libraries like mpmath
[23:58:36] <apotheon> If you want something to put on a resume, or to use common frameworks for web development, or to use decent libraries for science related stuff, for instance, Python is the more practical choice of the two.  If you want portable bespoke sysadmin scripting, something for cases where sh just isn't quite enough, something that's *always* already there in very Unixy environments, exceedingly easy
[23:58:43] <apotheon> text processing, and so on, awk beats the shit out of Python.
[23:59:09] <droid3> I didnt realize because most libraries for arbitrary precison dont allow for rational powers only integers at least for most language python seems to be head of the curve in this.
[23:59:49] <droid3> My question is i know how to getcontext().prec = 1000 for a thousand digit precision.
[23:59:53] <apotheon> nomagno: Realistically, early Perl was essentially redundant, and wholly unnecessary.  People just, even then, weren't really aware of the richness of capabilities in the Unix system.  Perl grew more sophisticated over time, though, and became something wholly different.
[23:59:54] <user51> i've found that awk has some limitations that are mitigated to some degree in gawk. but it might be also refreshing to see how different or similar a different language does things.
