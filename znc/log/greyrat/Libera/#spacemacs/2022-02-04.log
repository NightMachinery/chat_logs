[00:46:05] <FromGitter> <ryanprior:matrix.org> I want to set up one dark mode frame and another light mode frame. It seems like Emacs has a system for frame-local faces, but it's not clear how to actually use that functionality. Anybody have ideas?
[01:17:28] <FromGitter> <kjartan_oli:matrix.org> I'd guess so.  What major mode do they open in?
[01:20:35] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> Normal.  But it looks like that is the case for any file type emacs can't determine.  I can create a text file with a random file extension (e.g., "textfile.arstftr") and spell check is always disabled by default.
[01:25:12] <FromGitter> <kjartan_oli:matrix.org> You could try adding a hook to enable spell checking in that mode, although that will probably turn it on in other contexts to which might not be desirable.
[01:26:46] <FromGitter> <golanv:tchncs.de> Thanks, I'll look into that.  Perhaps my other choice is to never mispell anything...
[01:30:31] <FromGitter> <kjartan_oli:matrix.org> That one would be nice, if one could pull it of.  You could also manually enable spell checking but that will definitely get tedious quickly. I'd guess you'll probably encounter fewer cases where you don't want it so disabling it manually in those cases will probably be better.
