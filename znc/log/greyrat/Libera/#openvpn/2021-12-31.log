[14:13:12] <pagios> hi, when i am connected to a vpn, does it mean all traffic goes to the vpn and the firewall only sees connections to the vpn no matter what port/services i am using ? browser/irc/etc? everything is seen going on the vpn udp/tcp port ?

[22:13:00] <colo> hi
[22:14:05] <colo> I would like to compare a number of differen hardware platforms/configs in terms of openvpn performance. is there an easy way to test openvpn throughput with various ciphers via a loopback setup, so that network interface speed does not influence the result?
[22:14:56] <colo> I have found https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/sample/sample-config-files/loopback-server and loopback-client, but I fail to understand how/if I can actually tunnel, say, iperf3 through that kind of client-server-setup
[22:15:34] <ecrist> quick and dirty is just "openssl speed"
[22:15:56] <ecrist> that'll tell you what the actual cipher is doing on the hardware, external of openvpn
[22:16:09] <colo> ah, so one can expect openssl's stream cipher speed to match what openvpn would be able to do at most?
[22:16:22] <ecrist> it's using the same libs
[22:16:30] <colo> yeah, makes sense
[22:16:33] <ecrist> everything else is going to be variable
[22:16:50] <ecrist> interface speed, network congestion, internet congestion, etc.
[22:17:20] <colo> yeah, sure :) I would like to establish a purely theoretical maximum, with a given compute resources setup
[22:17:32] <colo> I am aware it's hopefully not the limiting factor :)
[22:19:20] <ecrist> the real limits are usually intenet bandwidth, and openvpn is still single threaded, so you see a maximum of about 200-ish clients per instance
[22:25:33] <colo> ecrist, would `openssl speed -evp aes-256-gcm` yield the appropriate numbers corresponding with the openvpn "cipher AES-256-GCM" setting?
