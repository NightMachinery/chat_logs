[08:24:52] <Hydragyrum> you can get pretty darn good still

[08:27:26] <Hydragyrum> Personally what I'd suggest: don't bother with encrypted /boot, ensure that kernel, initrd, bootloader, and kernel parameters are validated (secure boot signatures), and with encrypted root you should be 90%+ of the way there
[08:30:14] <Hydragyrum> this would protect you against almost all physical-access attacks (it wouldn't help against anything that runs code on your active system, but it'd fit your described threat model quite well)

[12:51:21] <andrew__> do I need a /boot partition if I'm installing arch as a home server?
[12:52:37] <grawity> it really doesn't depend on whether you're installing arch as a home server or as something else
[12:52:44] *** Quits: Betal (~Betal@user/betal) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[12:53:14] <grawity> generally, you need a /boot partition if your "/" filesystem is too complex for your bootloader to reliably access
[12:53:45] *** Joins: Chanakan5591_ (~Chanakan5@user/chanakan5591)
[12:54:21] <grawity> for example, GRUB is very limited when it comes to accessing ZFS, so if you have a ZFS / with fancy raidz, you will need a simpler /boot to keep it GRUB-accessible
[12:54:49] *** Quits: Chanakan5591 (~Chanakan5@user/chanakan5591) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[12:55:52] <grawity> meanwhile it can access files on ext4 just fine (even on dmraid or lvm), so that doesn't create a requirement for separate /boot

[12:56:25] <andrew__> ah, I see; so it is all about the boot loader; but what about the UEFI, how does it run grub? does the UEFI BIOS understands the partitions?
[12:56:34] <andrew__> filesystem*
[12:56:49] <wykwit> what he hell happened to the archwiki layout
[12:57:00] *** Joins: adnidor (~adnidor@p54aec1f1.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[12:57:25] <grawity> UEFI is similar case, except it's much more limited – it'll indeed load GRUB out of a partition, but it requires a FAT32 partition specifically
[12:58:34] <grawity> so you will always need an "EFI system partition" with vfat
[12:58:42] <andrew__> ah,I see
[12:59:11] <andrew__> thank you for clarification
[12:59:17] <grawity> which *may* be mounted at /boot and serve also as your boot partition, but that's not required (/efi and /boot/efi are also common)
[13:01:28] *** Joins: Chanakan5591 (~Chanakan5@user/chanakan5591)
[13:01:44] <grawity> so in "short", 1) UEFI loads grub.efi from the ESP, 2) grub.efi uses its embedded filesystem drivers (decided by grub-install) to read /boot/grub/grub.cfg and possibly load additional modules from /boot, 3) grub.efi loads vmlinuz & initramfs from /boot, 3) the initramfs uses Linux's full drivers to mount /

[13:14:25] <Gagis> and it is indeed well researched that spreading text to use all of available screen space is just bad UI design. The new theme makes a lot of sense.

[14:26:26] <Ghosthree3> nl6720: i feel like its irrelevant how readable it is on mobile, a mobile UA should simply pull a different theme altogether, saying the perfectly fine and superior desktop theme needs to go because of (disgusting) mobile users is not the way to go
[14:26:49] <nl6720> I don't think relying on UA is very modern
[14:27:24] <beastDivision> nl6720: is that saying the maintainer is open to changing the followed link color?
[14:27:27] <Ghosthree3> well, whatever it is that you use to check if a mobile device is being used or a desktop

[14:34:11] <Tom^> nl6720: if you dont change this back im emailing your mom.
[14:35:05] <Gagis> the mobile users are the same people as desktop users. lets not pretend theres some sort of magical different class of users.
[14:35:11] <Ghosthree3> i legitimately cannot believe mobile users are why the wiki is now broken on desktop, unreal
[14:35:28] <jelle> I cannot believe the amount of people I see crying here ^_^
[14:35:39] <Ghosthree3> why not feed the devices different themes if its an issue
[14:35:59] <Tom^> now tbh like it matters, the wikipedia is just there to help you setup things fast. its not something you sit and read day out and in. if its a new theme thats ending as the default so be it. dont like it? start reading the manpages. or just get firefox and theme the archwiki yourself with the various addons.

[14:37:10] <grawity> what I missed is

[14:38:21] <andrew__> so I'm going to use btrfs, is there any reason to use SHA256 and not BLAKE2?
[14:38:21] <nl6720> well, it will be possible to disable it when they split both Vectors into distinct skins
[14:38:21] <Ghosthree3> im using a userscript to force each page to use version 1 atm
[14:38:50] <Gagis> grawity, the complains about needing an excessive number of mouse translations and clicks to access menus is actually a legit complaint. the number of actions needed to perform tasks is the core metric of good UI design. thats however not what people have actually been complaining about -_-
[14:39:58] <grawity> andrew__: for the CRC?

[14:55:57] <indyZ> Hi. Someone put a program I made into AUR. That package/PKGBUILD is now outdated (last updated in 2015), with old dependencies etc. I kindly emailed the maintainer asking if he cared to update the pacakage, but didn't get a response. What is the normal procedure to get a new package into Arch or AUR? Should I install arch (I normally use Debian) and try to make one myself, and look into taking over the 
[14:56:03] <indyZ> abandoned package? 
[14:56:19] <Tom^> grawity: i wonder if /etc/audit/auditd.conf doesnt let you simply stop it spamming dmesg and only log to a file instead.

[21:29:16] <skyfaller> sorry if this is a stupid question, but I have an Ansible script that I run to update the software on my Arch Linux server. Today it couldn't run an update because I had run out of disk space. I ssh'ed in and figured out that I had to run `pacman -Sc` to clean my cache to free up sufficient disk space. Is this something I should run regularly as part of my scripts? Has something that is supposed to keep the cache at a
[21:29:16] <skyfaller>  manageable size gone wrong?

[22:54:29] <nothereisnotanam> nac: its a mobile theme
[22:54:33] <ayr-ton> Scimmia: Yes. Only after running makepkg. 
[22:54:38] <nothereisnotanam> it was changed so mobile works
[22:54:39] <ayr-ton> the src/binnary is fine
[22:54:43] <nothereisnotanam> but now everything uses the mobile theme
[22:54:44] <Scimmia> ayr-ton: try it with the !strip option
[22:55:05] <ayr-ton> testing now
[22:55:32] <nac> nothereisnotanam: I understand the reasoning. But I feel like there  had to be a better option than essentially breaking the desktop theme just to appease to mobile users 🤷
[22:55:33] <nothereisnotanam> append `?useskinversion=1` to arch wiki urls to get the old theme back
