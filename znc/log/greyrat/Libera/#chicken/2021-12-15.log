[01:47:07] <jcowan> The utf8 egg is like the old numbers egg: it's a half-assed solution.  We need to do it pervasively, more or less as Chibi does.

[02:00:30] <jcowan> Not my job at present: I am the village idiot, who goes around saying "This is WRONG".  foof would be the right person, just as wasamasa was the right person for C5 numbers.
[02:00:43] <Bunny351> sjamaan
[02:00:56] <Bunny351> ...did most of the work
[02:00:59] <wasamasa> lol
[02:03:23] <Bunny351> and the changes were massive, including intermediate "scratch" allocation areas to speed things up
[02:06:02] <Bunny351> still, the transition was rather smooth, considering the amount of changes this involved

[07:05:20] <m455> weird, i get a error saying -static-libs doesn't exist when using chicken 5
[07:05:46] <m455> i should note that chicken5 was installed with debian's package management (apt install chicken-bin), and not from source
[07:06:03] <m455> just trying to use `csc -static-libs ...`
[07:06:29] <m455> ah here's my specific command actually haha: csc -t -static-libs src/main.scm -o ./out.c
[07:11:13] <jcroisant> m455: Do you mean to use `-static`?
[07:11:35] <m455> jcroisant: oh i actually mean to use `csc -t -static -static-libs src/main.scm -o ./out.c`
[07:11:51] <m455> i was seeing if i could like bake and dependencies into the C file itself haha
[07:12:07] <m455> i noticed in the man page for csc that there was a -static-libs option so i was trying it out
[07:12:31] <jcroisant> Aha. That is an error in the man page.
[07:12:41] <m455> seeing if i could make a self contained C file containing any chicken libraries that you would otherwise install with chicken-install, but maybe i don't know waht static-libs are haha
[07:12:51] <m455> jcroisant: ahhh shit i had a hunch it might be!
[07:12:53] <m455> haha
[07:14:00] <m455> is static-libs just what -static does then? haha
[07:14:05] <m455> i cause i love that flag ahaha
[07:14:21] <m455> i love that i can just make a portable executable and run shit without needing the chicken runtime :D
[07:14:34] <m455> gonna head to bed now though. talk to you later!!
[07:15:27] <jcroisant> m455: Good night!
[07:29:41] <m455> maybe i can look into submitting a fix to the man page file for htat ;) it would be fun to be able to contribute to the "source" (just the documentation i guess haha) as someone who is just a technical writer lol
[07:29:49] <m455> anyway, good night for real hahaha

[21:49:49] <mario-goulart> sjamaan: random question of the day: off the top of your head, is there something in spiffy that would cause the charset attribute of Content-Type to be removed from the server response headers?
[21:52:15] <mario-goulart> I tried that with more than 10 different clients on different systems and could not reproduce that.  A friend of mine can reproduce that with curl and Chrome from his Android phone (I tried curl and Fennec from my phone and could NOT reproduce the problem).
[21:54:41] <mario-goulart> Actually I could run a sniffer on the server side to see if the attribute is being stripped by the server or the client.
