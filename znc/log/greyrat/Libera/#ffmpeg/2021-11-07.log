[00:00:40] <aphysically> I"ll just see if ar satisfies it
[00:01:43] *** Joins: nd (~nd@user/nd)
[00:03:43] <aphysically> nope that's not good enough
[00:04:39] <JEEB> post a log on a pastebin with verbosity level verbose or so? is it the input or output.
[00:04:55] <JEEB> that should include both the input and output configurations
[00:05:29] <aphysically> I was trying to set it on the output, can I set -ar as an input option?
[00:05:44] <aphysically> and yeah one sec it's a bit more work to get the logs than normal cause it's running on server-side
[00:06:50] <aphysically> interestingly this is happening for a file where I *did* change the samplerate (from 96kHz to 48 kHz), so I wonder if this is really a problem with the way I'm doing that
[00:07:07] <aphysically> the output file is playable and in 48 kHz but maybe I need to *also* set -ar or something to write some sort of metadata that's making dash choke?
[00:08:39] <furq> it exists as an input option but maybe not for the demuxer you're using
[00:12:56] <JEEB> first of all please provide the input and output listings
[00:13:06] <JEEB> let's not go any further until you get those out
[00:13:28] <JEEB> that way it should give you hints on *why* you're getting that error
[00:15:07] <JEEB> since if you have the sample rate set properly on both sides of that, you should not be getting that error.
[00:16:36] <zak_> durandal_1707: It's 16000Hz, mono. After compression the bitrate ends up being 32 kbps. I'm not sure if it's ADPCM, but looking at some source code, it looks like it has similar parameters to G722
[00:16:51] <aphysically> yeah the command is going to be enormous just because of trivial transcodes on the video side so I'm trying to dilute it
[00:17:23] <aphysically> but the fact that I've only ever seen this on a file I'm chanign the sample rate on makes me think that the aresampler=blah:osr=48000 isn't enough to "properly" set the sample rate
[00:17:40] <aphysically> i.e. that it's missing changing some sort of metadata somewhere
[00:18:30] <durandal_1707> zak_: so its 1/8 of uncompressed?
[00:19:50] <JEEB> aphysically: I'm fine with you preferring to guesstimate on your own side and not providing helpful logs. have a good and productive evening. I will move onto something more productive as well.
[00:20:05] <durandal_1707> zak_: for example adpcm_ms is just 1/4 of uncompressed
[00:20:06] <zak_> durandal_1707: yup. About that ratio
[00:20:15] <aphysically> I'm working on it I just have to upload a new versoin of this thing to make the reports :P
[00:20:17] <zak_> 80 bytes is 20 milliseconds of audio
[00:20:54] <durandal_1707> zak_: have you located binary responsible for decoding of it?
[00:21:15] <zak_> I don't have access to it (easily). The decoding logic is on an embedded device
[00:21:26] <aphysically> JEEB: this is the downside of moving everything to python I guess, more to dig into to get the debug information otu when I didn't plan ahead well
[00:22:23] <durandal_1707> zak_: do you have at least compressed audio files willing to share?
[00:22:36] <zak_> durandal_1707: of course
[00:22:53] <zak_> Let me up host it somewhere
[00:23:08] <zak_> is a bigger or smaller file better?
[00:23:37] <zak_> nevermind, I'll upload both
[00:24:11] <edman007> Hey, so I'm trying to call av_hwdevice_get_hwframe_constraints() with a HWconfig (VAAPI), the hwconfig needs a VAConfigID, all the examples show getting it from the avcodeccontext, however I'm trying to do this from a filter (via hwupload), I don't have a VAAPIcodeccontext, I have a HW device context, and a HW frames context. I don't see how I get a VAConfigID from either of those
[00:25:49] <zak_> What's a recommended place where I can upload files?
[00:26:04] <durandal_1707> zak_: anywhere and than give link to it
[00:26:23] <durandal_1707> 0x0.st with curl
[00:27:08] <zak_> https://easyupload.io/p25n2x here's a small one
[00:27:40] <zak_> https://easyupload.io/doks62 a bigger one
[00:28:05] <zak_> They both have a header, which is described here: https://www.exploitee.rs/index.php/Teddy_Ruxpin#SNX_Rom
[00:28:18] <zak_> See "AudioHeader"
[00:31:07] <zak_> There's partial source code which shows some structs that are used to help the decoder. https://github.com/WHhkwong/SIPI_Bear_playback/blob/master/SNC7001A_Audio_Algorithm_RAM_Assignment/Audio32RAM.asm
[00:31:44] <zak_> "num_categorization_control_bits" and "num_categorization_control_possibilities" are the things that led me to believe it was "G722_1"-like.. but I am totally noob in this area

[00:50:00] <zak_> yeah, pretty much
[00:50:19] <zak_> I found an "encode.exe" but it's missing the DLL with the encoding logic (or I believe)
[00:51:35] <zak_> Sonix describe this as "Audio32" in documentation and code, but it's also called "Sonix codec".
[00:51:47] <zak_> Sonix actually uses a few types of different codecs to be fair though

[00:59:49] <durandal_1707> zak_: there is example source code that use those libs in same repository, so if you can build it....
[01:00:10] <aphysically> increasing -analyze_duration and such fixes the problem
[01:00:26] <aphysically> so the problem is for truehd audio in some mkv the default probesize/analyze_duration aren't good enough
[01:02:02] <aphysically> it's interesting that the encode works but only some sort of metadata doesn't get set when the probesize is too small JEEB
[01:02:18] <aphysically> I'm not sure what's going on but I guess it's not really important to understand
[01:04:43] <aphysically> I wonder if there's any good way to autodetect if increased probesize is needed other than just highlighting that sort of error?
[01:04:57] <aphysically> I guess if there was a good way then ffmpeg would already be doing it

[23:19:42] <samhza> Is there a way to set a timestamp for when the subtitles should start at with the subtitles filter?
[23:20:25] <samhza> If I seek with -ss 23 -i file.mkv and then use the subtitles filter, the subtitles will be 23 seconds behind the video
[23:20:59] <samhza> If I use -ss after -i it takes longer to run because it will have to read up to that point in the file rather than just seeking
