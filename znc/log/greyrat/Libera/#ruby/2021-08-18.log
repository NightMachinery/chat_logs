[00:00:13] <weaksauce> michigan system ruby is fine if you never update your system
[00:00:25] <weaksauce> and don't want to use a newer ruby
[00:01:25] <nesoi> hm use ruby-build to add a new version?
[00:01:29] <nesoi> install

[00:02:18] <nesoi> or brew?
[00:04:17] <weaksauce> ruby install is the co project of chruby so i'd go with that but any should work 
[00:04:32] <weaksauce> well except brew
[00:04:37] <weaksauce> that would be system i think
[00:05:14] <rapha> "michigan system"?

[00:06:56] <nesoi> thanks
[00:09:05] <weaksauce> maybe some kind of seek

[00:18:33] <michigan> rapha: you've never heard of michigan system? :)
[00:18:34] <weaksauce> michigan also if you're going to ship code you want it to be divorced from whatever os is on the other side 
[00:19:12] <michigan> weaksauce: never thought of it that way, good point
[00:19:59] <weaksauce> but if you're just writing toy scripts on a reasonably new ruby without dependencies it's fine
[00:20:45] <michigan> im just writing rails apps on my own openbsd servers so i guess system ruby is ok for me (it comes in many versions as well)

[03:41:40] <nesoi> my project doesn't have a gemfile itself but uses some, if tht's what you mean?
[03:41:59] <weaksauce> what kind of project is it? 
[03:42:08] <weaksauce> a gemfile is basically a must
[03:42:46] <nesoi> it's just a short program
[03:43:03] <weaksauce> but it uses gems... a bundle setup is a must
[03:43:30] <nesoi> it just requires some
[03:43:31] <weaksauce> i mean you can install it globally and hope it works out but a gemfile with a lock that specifies versions keeps thing working correctly

[04:40:19] <weaksauce> yeah this is why it's smart to use bundler from the get to 
[04:40:21] <weaksauce> get go
[04:40:36] <weaksauce> seems that API changed or something
[04:41:57] <nesoi> rake?
[04:42:06] <nesoi> how would a bundler help that?
[04:42:41] <weaksauce> what rake task are you doing? 
[04:42:56] <weaksauce> well all the deps need to interact well together 
[04:43:03] <weaksauce> that's what bundler helps with 
[04:43:35] <nesoi> I need to recreate the db, so I'm just trying to do migrate
[04:43:37] <nesoi> from 0
[04:44:40] <weaksauce> rake db:create well rails in more current versions of rails 
[04:44:46] <weaksauce> rails db:create
[04:45:04] <nesoi> not using rails tho
[04:45:08] <nesoi> just using activerecord
[04:45:42] <weaksauce> gist your code maybe? 
[04:46:06] <nesoi> which code?
[04:46:29] <weaksauce> rakefile up to the entire repository 
[04:46:46] <weaksauce> rakefile to start but the entire thing would be useful 
[04:49:11] <newton> if it's an _old_ app the version of activerecord that it was built with might not be compatible with the version installed
[04:49:52] <nesoi> https://pastebin.com/ekFCeV2L
[04:52:40] <nesoi> seems simple?
[04:54:31] <weaksauce> yeah you probably want to start by finding out when active record dropped that method 
[04:54:46] <weaksauce> yeah running old code on new gems is most likely not going to work
[04:55:19] <nesoi> ok so why do I need new gems?
[04:55:26] <nesoi> I just want to run this the way it used to run
[04:55:47] <newton> if you did `gem install activerecord` it would have installed the latest activerecord
[04:56:00] <newton> which could be multiple major versions different than when it was used with that app
[04:56:07] <weaksauce> again, since you installed gems manually without specifying versions it's going to pull the latest and greatest 
[04:56:18] <weaksauce> which is the problem that bundler solves in the first place
[04:56:41] <weaksauce> BUT you needed to have used it THEN to reap the benefits of versioning the gems now

[05:09:39] <nesoi> I don't know what "# Specify your gem's dependencies in haml-rails.gemspec" means
[05:09:56] <nesoi> or what the syntax of the gemfile means

[05:10:24] * michigan gives weaksauce https://www.dochotties.com/products/blairs-mega-death-sauce-with-liquid-fury
[05:10:33] <nakilon> it's when you use the gem with badly defined .gemspec
[05:10:48] <nakilon> so you have to override by making your own gemspec for the gem, based on the source one from github
[05:10:51] <weaksauce> yum michigan

[05:11:29] <nesoi>                    ^~~~~~~. Bundler cannot continue.
[05:11:58] <weaksauce> https://github.com/haml/haml-rails/blob/master/Gemfile is just an example 
[05:12:03] <newton> if you look at the line you can copy from "gemfile" on this page you'll see the correct syntax https://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord/versions/5.1.7
[05:13:35] <nesoi> it installed 5.2.6 instead and doesn't work 
[05:13:50] <nesoi> using gem 'activerecord', '~> 5.1', '>= 5.1.7'
[05:15:21] <nesoi> why would it install a later version than specified?
[05:16:09] <nesoi> tried it with gem 'activerecord', '~> 5.1', '>= 5.1.6.2'
[05:16:12] <nesoi> still installed 5.2.6
[05:16:13] <newton> yeah that's my bad. it's better if you just do '5.1.7' as the second param and remove the third: gem 'activerecord', '5.1.7'
[05:16:57] <nesoi> yay, that worked! thanks!
[05:17:23] <nesoi> still doesn't find the method :(
[05:17:39] <newton> how are you running the script
[05:18:22] <nesoi> rake migrate
[05:18:27] <newton> try bundle exec rake migrate
[05:22:49] <nesoi> cool that worked!
[05:23:53] <newton> if you're going to try to run this app anywhere else you should add the rest of the dependencies you `gem install`'d to that gemfile too
[05:24:27] <nesoi> right. I wasn't planning to though :)
[05:24:54] <nesoi> now I have more errors anyway on the actual program
[05:25:03] <newton> lol
[05:25:05] <nesoi> thanks everyone!!! back later
[05:25:15] <nesoi> maybe I need the old version of that gem too
[05:26:45] <weaksauce> i mean you might want to run it later so just bundle add gemname
[05:26:56] <weaksauce> and adjust the versions accordingly

I have a large number of gems that need to be installed on a server. the version of ruby (for reasons....) is quite old at 2.5.8. if I gem install them as a long list or bundle install them as a single gemfile the install takes about 2 hours as the dependencies can not be bulk downloaded but a dep file for each version of every gem is downloaded independantly for the dependency graph to be built locally. I'm sure I'm doing this wrong...

[20:31:30] <adam12> I'm presuming you might be ratelimited, since it makes a GET to every one of those dependencies (I didn't wait for it to finish so I don't know what it tries to do after that).
[20:36:01] <mjh> I'm not sure that I've been ratelimited yet, unfortunately I dont think that they will be able to as this is a AWS build - I imagine that every time I start a new build I will be sending requests from a new ip address. I doubt they will want to rate limit all of aws... Which means I need to be careful.
