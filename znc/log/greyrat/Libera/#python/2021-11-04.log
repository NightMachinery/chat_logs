[01:09:06] <gr3yh47> @KirkMcDonald woah i think you're right
[01:09:16] <Compu-Celebi> The description of `env` is, "Run a program in a modified environment."
[01:09:48] <Compu-Celebi> The environment is not modified if no environment variable values are specified in the `env` command.
[01:09:51] <gr3yh47> KirkMcDonald: if there are 40 items it should result in 20 one time. if there are 41 items it should result in 20 then 40
[01:10:00] <gr3yh47> that's the desired behavior
[01:10:05] <gr3yh47> i think your idea does that
[01:10:05] <KirkMcDonald> Compu-Celebi: The shbang line `#!/usr/bin/env python3` is used so that it looks up python3 in the $PATH.
[01:10:11] <grym> Compu-Celebi: instead of hardcoding a path, env looks at the user's $PATH
[01:10:22] <grym> which is generally speaking more portable/correct

[01:10:53] <grym> well, that's what env does
[01:11:07] <grym> you can try it yourself in a terminal; run `env python3`
[01:11:29] <Compu-Celebi> Why could I not simply use `#! python3`, given that inputting `python3` into my terminal results in it executing `/usr/bin/python3`?
[01:11:37] <KirkMcDonald> The shbang line does not, itself, look up the command in the $PATH. It requires an absolute path.
[01:11:40] <Compu-Celebi> `PATH` is already used in that case.

[01:16:20] <Compu-Celebi> I already tested `env python3` in my terminal before grym mentioned it, and it had seemed that it caused Python 3.6.9 to execute only because inputting `python3` yields the same result.
[01:16:35] <grym> Compu-Celebi: that means that 3.6 is first on your path
[01:17:00] <Compu-Celebi> It means that `/usr/bin/python3` links to `/usr/bin/python3.6`, as I previously referenced.

[11:25:23] <cads> parv, so I would move the typing annotation into a decorator, and the decorator would lose its shit if I do myfunc({"this", "set", "is", "little"}, {"this", "set", "is", "L O R G E"})

[11:26:28] <cads> thank you!
[11:27:01] <parv> cads,  Heh. I am only forwarding what I found about decorators. Still need to try myself.
[11:27:47] <parv> cads, But if that relation is only one function, I do not see the point as assert() of subset check could be done directly in the actual function
[11:28:11] <parv> s/assert()/assert/  # pardon me
[11:28:33] <cads> yeah but when that check is just one of 5 or 6 other details like that, suddenly the function becomes hard to read an unpythonic
[11:28:46] <cads> like the horrible pidgin-python that AI researchers write
[11:29:00] <parv> cads, Right. Just add another layer.
[11:29:25] <cads> which is why I hope to push the detail into the declaration without adding an obvious new layer.. but if for now it /is/ a decorator layer... I can live with it
[11:30:18] <cads> lol, I bet that by year 2027, python's typing engine will be turing complete and able to represent math proofs, as well as simple subset dependencies

[17:52:21] <SnoopJ> vladoski, you can change constants associated with the function with some magick, but for other things, you might want to consider dependency injection. If you show us an example of what you want to mock we can give a more complete answer.

[18:08:40] <ammarsalmi> but python just dealt with it as y**x

[18:08:55] <ammarsalmi> Ok got it.

[18:09:01] <SnoopJ> you can think of unary + as the opposite of unary -

[18:09:22] <exarkun> Does it make any sense to try to add type annotations for a zope.interface?  Does any of the tooling understand or do anything with such annotations?
[18:09:33] <az> I read more about inheritance, __init__ is used to overrides parents __init__ method but then we use super() with __init__ , why did you use both __init__ and super() instead of just having none of them and inheriting the full thing?
[18:09:58] <SnoopJ> az, because sometimes you want to do some init in the derived class, and then defer to the base class's init
[18:10:23] <SnoopJ> if you only want behavior in the base class, there's not really any point to writing an __init__ that just calls the base class's __init__

[19:37:33] <SnoopJ> mattf, can you explain what "direction" means to you?

[19:37:58] <summonner> and what's a "floating point error" in this instance?
[19:37:58] <mattf> but that requires dividing by the distance, which is a square root, thus floating precision errors come
[19:38:01] <SnoopJ> If you're using floats, you have the potential for floating point error
[19:38:09] <mattf> i dont want to use floats

[19:40:11] <grym> (aka, 'with what precision')

[19:41:28] <grym> 2.718 degrees is well within float tolerance :)

[20:29:45] <InPhase> lionslicer: As long as you have the background prerequisites, it's pretty much never too early to learn something that you will use in your career.
[20:30:08] <InPhase> lionslicer: But there is some value to prioritizing the ordering of things that will be most foundational.
[20:31:19] <InPhase> lionslicer: Perhaps take some time to think about what aspects of computing you are most interested in working with, and focus your depth on those, while keeping breadth in the other areas.

[22:38:37] <Exmodaus> Hello all, I have been using python for about 7 months and I am trying to do a project but some of the more technical aspects of programming still get me stuck. I am using Anaconda with Sublime, I am trying to use selenium and chromedriver. I did a PIP install with selenium and it was fine, i did the same for chrome driver but I keep getting an
[22:38:38] <Exmodaus> exception that Chromedriver executable needs to be in a path. I added it to the path and same error. I tried installing chromedriver from anaconda and I get an error that it can not install for version issues. Is there anyone experienced with selenium, chromedriver, or how anaconda works that can help me sort this out? I have tried googling and
[22:38:38] <Exmodaus> ended up signing up here as a last hope, since I cant seem to understand what is missing
[22:38:45] <jinsun> mike18: this might be typeshed bug because typeshed says it cannot take None https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/stdlib/traceback.pyi#L71
[22:38:54] <mike18> ok what to do?
[22:39:05] <mike18> it seems traceback.TracebackException(*sys.exc_info()) fixes it
[22:39:20] <jinsun> mike18: yeah you can create an issue there, and use traceback.TracebackException(*sys.exc_info()) for now

[23:11:57] <summonner> Kabouik, so the problem is you need to write out things, then close and flush the file handler. It sounds like you have another process/app - it's accessing the same file at the same time? is that right?
[23:13:50] <Kabouik> Right now the script itself works, but yeah the file is not actually containing anything until I stop the python process, which (1) prevents using other programs on the output file while it's being written, and (2) concerns me about data loss in case of computer crash or out of memory issue.

[23:31:47] <SnoopJ> Exmodaus, in general it's hard to catch the case where `pip` and `python` don't point at the same thing, which is why always going through `python` minimizes the amount of places for it to break
[23:31:52] <Kabouik> I'm just not sure of the added value in my case here, I'm a simple user who would prefer having his own program for recording data instead of locked or GUI solutions, but so far the CSV route filled all my needs (well, except for (1) and (2) issues detailed above, but is sqlite the best way to fix those?)

[23:32:12] <Kabouik> it's a real question, it might very well be the best solution, I'm all ears
[23:32:20] <grym> Kabouik: sqlite has stronger guarantees about write consistency and not blowing away previous data
[23:32:55] <grym> there's an export step if you want to footle around with the table in excel or something afterwards

[23:34:09] <Kabouik> Problem is I'm already struggling with the simpler script and spent the night on this tiny script you saw, sqlite seems like a huge rabbit hole for me if I have to write the few things that worked
[23:34:10] <summonner> Kabouik, you can charge extra for that functionality later ;)

[23:36:40] <Exmodaus> SnoopJ yeah, right now trying to figure out why python works but python3 says python was not found; run without arguments to install from the microsoft store, or disable this shortcut from settings> manage app execution aliases.
