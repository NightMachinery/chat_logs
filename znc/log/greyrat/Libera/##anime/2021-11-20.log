[00:01:02] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: any cute girls in it
[00:01:20] <ButterNoodle> in what?
[00:01:31] <MootPoot> live action bebop
[00:01:37] <ButterNoodle> probably...
[00:01:38] <emmeka> Berlin36 it's kind of odd, because that's a disc format that was obselete by the time DVDs were really accessible to anyone
[00:01:54] * MootPoot remembers laserdisc
[00:02:05] <emmeka> laserdisc isn't digital.
[00:02:19] <emmeka> or that old, it outlasted the VHS
[00:02:27] * MootPoot remembers the obsolete part
[00:03:13] <MootPoot> laserdisc was obsolete on launch
[00:03:18] <Berlin36> eh, tried another dvd, some boring stuff here
[00:03:19] <MootPoot> really
[00:03:23] <Berlin36> one more to go..
[00:03:56] <MootPoot> does anyone unironically use optical media anymore
[00:04:09] <ButterNoodle> I do
[00:04:10] <MootPoot> I guess there are those movie nerds
[00:04:11] <emmeka> MootPoot laserdisc wasn't obselete in its time, it was top of the line
[00:04:11] <Berlin36> idk
[00:04:16] <ButterNoodle> on old pc's
[00:04:18] <emmeka> sure, I use optical media still.
[00:04:36] <MootPoot> should have added - for new stuff
[00:04:44] <MootPoot> not that you have a pile lying around
[00:05:00] <MootPoot> do you ever go "damn I should burn this on a disc"
[00:05:10] <MootPoot> why are disc and disk spelled different
[00:05:11] <MootPoot> I hate it
[00:05:21] <emmeka> yes. I still burn live DVDs
[00:05:44] <MootPoot> a disc can be a disk but a disk does not have to be a disc
[00:05:56] <emmeka> anyway... MootPoot laserdiscs were top of the line in their time, and are old as hell. laserdiscs have been around since the 70s and in the late 80s/early 90s they were *the* high end home theatre solution
[00:06:02] <MootPoot> wait
[00:06:31] <MootPoot> OH
[00:06:36] <MootPoot> I'm retarded emmeka , dont mind me
[00:06:46] <MootPoot> I was thinking of HD-DVD
[00:06:53] <MootPoot> that was obsolete at launch
[00:07:15] <emmeka> I'm not sure how you'd confuse the two, but ok
[00:07:44] <MootPoot> hd-dvd = red color
[00:07:46] <MootPoot> laser = red
[00:07:52] <Berlin36> on the last dvd it says it runs on windows 95,98,2000
[00:07:56] <Berlin36> must be a old one
[00:08:06] <emmeka> HD-DVD wasn't "obselete on launch" either
[00:08:16] <MootPoot> what

[00:08:18] <MootPoot> it wasent
[00:08:19] <emmeka> it was locked in a format war with bluray, and at the time it wasn't clear who would win
[00:08:25] <emmeka> bluray did eventually win
[00:08:35] <MootPoot> blu ray was superior hands down
[00:08:41] <MootPoot> in performance
[00:08:42] <emmeka> but like xbox sided with hd-dvd, sony went with bluray, and it was a big format war

[00:15:59] <emmeka> ever so slightly, but still. they were competitors in the same time period with two behemoths each backing them. it wasn't certain which format would succeed at the time.

[00:17:33] <MootPoot> although blu ray as a software distribution platform never took off

[00:17:46] <MootPoot> no
[00:17:49] <MootPoot> wait
[00:17:51] <MootPoot> NO
[00:18:04] <MootPoot> the xbox 360 used DVD-DL's
[00:18:06] <MootPoot> not hd-dvd
[00:18:57] <MootPoot> oh
[00:19:04] <emmeka> yes, for games. but the original launch model Xbox 360 came with an HD-DVD player
[00:19:05] <MootPoot> it was some kind of shitty external plug in add on
[00:19:16] <MootPoot> no....
[00:19:22] <emmeka> yes...
[00:19:25] <MootPoot> I had a day 1 xbox 360
[00:19:29] <MootPoot> xenon model
[00:19:32] <MootPoot> no hd-dvd
[00:19:45] <MootPoot> although the poor thing red ringed like 3 hours in
[00:20:09] <Berlin36> welp
[00:20:14] <Berlin36> tried 9 dvd's
[00:20:16] <Berlin36> dvds
[00:20:32] <Berlin36> 4 of them worked, five of them didn't
[00:21:45] <emmeka> MootPoot many launch models came preboxed with the player. anyway, HD-DVD actually outsold Bluray for years. They were cheaper, and had a head start.
[00:22:00] <emmeka> or, year or two, rather than years
[00:22:06] <MootPoot> google senpai says the 360 came out in nov22 2005
[00:22:17] <MootPoot> and the HD dvd add on was released in 2006
[00:22:26] <MootPoot> november 7th
[00:22:41] <MootPoot> I thought I was losing my mind for a second
[00:22:42] <MootPoot> whew
[00:23:22] <emmeka> well, I was no xbox gamer at the time. but I do remember the HD-DVD players.
[00:26:32] <emmeka> MootPoot and, anyway, I did just double check. HD-DVD initially outsold Bluray by a significant margin for all of 2006, then Bluray sales increased a little through the Christmas season until the two were about equal, and then by spring 2007 Blurays outsold them, and then by 2008 the HD-DVD format was abandoned.

[00:53:09] <MootPoot> It's cellular networks 
[00:53:12] <emmeka> MootPoot in Europe AM/FM has been replaced by digital radio, but not here. The only digital radio standard is HD-Radio which is usually broadcast simultaneously with analog
[00:53:22] <emmeka> MootPoot no.
[00:53:39] <emmeka> it's radio. blasting modulated 1s and 0s instead of sound waves
[00:54:24] <MootPoot> Ohhhhhh

[01:20:21] <Satin> emmeka: maybe he doesn't drive as much as we do?
[01:20:26] <Satin> MootPoot: ?
[01:20:29] <Satin> do u
[01:20:37] <Berlin36> wow
[01:20:37] <MootPoot> My exposure consists of the car radio turning on when car started 
[01:20:42] <Satin> lol
[01:20:46] * Satin chuckles
[01:20:47] <Berlin36> MootPoot: don't you listen to radio?
[01:20:55] <Satin> emmeka:  the real boomer thing might be to grab a radio of your own and use it at home though
[01:20:57] <Satin> do you do that em
[01:21:06] <MootPoot> Listening for 5 seconds at a 100% concentrated stream of advertisements to my ear canals 
[01:21:10] <MootPoot> Then I turn it off
[01:21:13] <MootPoot> That's my exposure
[01:21:21] <Berlin36> lol
[01:21:22] <emmeka> what'll be nice is when ATSC 3.0 becomes a thing
[01:21:26] <Satin> change the radio station
[01:21:35] <Satin> moot
[01:21:42] <MootPoot> Satin: different flavor of ads
[01:21:47] <Satin> lol
[01:21:59] <MootPoot> It's all fucking ads
[01:22:06] <MootPoot> At some point it just becomes noise 
[01:22:14] <MootPoot> So I turn it off 
[01:22:42] <snake> yeah i hate radio
[01:22:53] <snake> it is like 3 minutes of music, 10 minutes of ads
[01:23:10] <Satin> I don't mind radio, the ads on some stations can be annoying, but on plenty of others it's a decent way to listen to music and news and so on
[01:23:12] <snake> or at least its just one song (3-5 minutes) then ads
[01:23:16] <Satin> i wish new mexico had more diversity
[01:23:32] <Satin> we only have like some conservative talkshow hosts, minus that one decent dude on KKOB news
[01:23:34] <snake> new mexico: mexico but its white
[01:23:37] <Satin> and then we have the KUNM music station
[01:23:41] <emmeka> MootPoot soon, broadcast TV will be 4K HEVC with surround sound and support for on-demand video
[01:23:44] * Satin eyerolls snake
[01:23:51] <emmeka> imagine streaming but you don't need an internet connection
[01:24:03] <Satin> emmeka: ads?
[01:24:06] <emmeka> you just wire up your antenna and then get streaming services
[01:24:09] <emmeka> Satin probably
[01:24:31] <emmeka> but, free, because there's no way to inhibit access
[01:25:03] <emmeka> plus, still getting live TV
[01:25:20] * MootPoot starts salvating
[01:25:25] <MootPoot> I cant wait
[01:25:28] <MootPoot> for 4k ads
[01:25:28] <Berlin36> i almost never heard ads on radio
[01:25:31] <Berlin36> lol
[01:25:32] <MootPoot> burned into my eyeballs
[01:25:56] <Berlin36> i mainly listened to radio when in a car, and it is just music lol
[01:26:11] <Satin> i think i hate ads as a model but i'm not sure what the alternative is
[01:26:20] <Satin> i also despise a lot of paid streaming services
[01:26:24] <Satin> and their attempts to DRM everything
[01:26:34] <Satin> and turn owning media away into a rent-media model
[01:26:39] <Satin> fuck off with that shit
[01:26:41] <MootPoot> there is only one solution
[01:26:48] <MootPoot> if you hate it all like that
[01:26:55] <MootPoot> although knowing you
[01:26:59] <MootPoot> you'll probably hate this one too
[01:27:03] <Satin> your mother
[01:27:06] <Satin> and me
[01:27:07] <MootPoot> your father
[01:27:09] <Satin> watch ads
[01:27:10] <MootPoot> and  me
[01:27:12] <MootPoot> fuck
[01:27:13] <Satin> while
[01:27:18] <MootPoot> your mom
[01:27:19] <Satin> doing 
[01:27:20] <MootPoot> is watching
[01:27:29] <Satin> some cooking and gardening
[01:27:32] <MootPoot> yes
[01:27:38] <MootPoot> lmao
[01:27:40] <Berlin36> this conversation is cancer
[01:27:40] <Satin> jk i don't know how to
[01:27:43] <MootPoot> ok but legit
[01:27:52] <MootPoot> Satin: state funded / taxpayer radio
[01:27:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Finally some free time~

[01:28:09] <MootPoot> you have NPR tho
[01:28:09] <Satin> it already exists
[01:28:12] <Satin> i know
[01:28:16] <Satin> but it's not ad free or anything
[01:28:17] <MootPoot> what's the problem then
[01:28:18] <MootPoot> oh
[01:28:20] <MootPoot> really
[01:28:20] <Satin> and it's not multiple stations
[01:28:23] <Satin> yeah
[01:28:30] <Satin> and NPR airs at very specific hours
[01:28:34] <Satin> at least here in new mexico
[01:28:36] <MootPoot> wat
[01:28:39] <Satin> back in missouri it was uh still ads uh
[01:28:42] <MootPoot> its state radio
[01:28:45] <MootPoot> how is it not like
[01:28:46] <MootPoot> 24/7
[01:28:54] <Satin> music or something most of the time
[01:28:54] * MootPoot feels alienated

[01:29:24] <Satin> latter
[01:29:26] <MootPoot> AH
[01:29:26] <emmeka> the nice thing about ATSC 3.0 will be you can DVR all the things
[01:29:27] <MootPoot> okay
[01:29:30] <MootPoot> what I meant was like
[01:29:32] <Satin> NPR doesn't have some dedciated channel everywhere
[01:29:36] <MootPoot> ^
[01:29:37] <Satin> yea it's a lot dependent on local public stations
[01:29:38] <emmeka> so yes, ads, but free and on-demand
[01:29:40] <MootPoot> we have that here

[01:30:10] <emmeka> CBC has many radio stations some of which are 24 hour and some of which are not
[01:30:13] <Satin> i don't actually mind paying a bit
[01:30:16] <Satin> if it's affordable
[01:30:21] <Satin> and open and public oriented
[01:30:27] <Satin> but that'll never happen
[01:30:33] <Satin> it's either spammy ads and bullshit
[01:30:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I mind paying because it assumes you have your budget planned out years ahead of time.
[01:30:38] <Satin> orcorporation bullshit
[01:30:55] <Satin> eh i think people wanting free shit always
[01:30:59] <Satin> is partly what got us into this position
[01:31:12] <Satin> where our data is mined by corporations and what not and we give it up for ""freee" services
[01:31:19] <Satin> when in reality we're providing far more value to them and the internet
[01:31:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If you look at the pattern, not really.
[01:31:31] <Satin> it's fine to pay for things. as long as they're good options.
[01:31:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Corporations have always wanted walled-guarden legally-protected monopolies.
[01:31:43] <emmeka> well, once upon a time anyone could watch all TV for free with ads, and that was the only business model
[01:31:50] <emmeka> and then somehow we duped everyone into paying for ads
[01:31:52] <Satin> yeah but that's not just succeeding because of corporations
[01:31:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The fact people want free shit just helps with selling your junkware when you give the duplicitous illusion it's free.
[01:32:03] <Satin> it's also succeeding because people are dummies and want free things
[01:32:03] <MootPoot> Soon we will have TV which are 100% ads
[01:32:06] <Satin> yes that's what i'm saying
[01:32:09] <Satin> it's on people as well
[01:32:16] <Satin> and they need to be willing to switch over to paid but robust services
[01:32:17] <MootPoot> FREE
[01:32:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: Wanting stuff not for free wouldn't prevent it though.
[01:32:24] <Satin> otherwise we'll never have competition to youtube
[01:32:26] <Satin> or whatever
[01:32:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You'd still get monopolistic walled-gardens.
[01:32:31] <Satin> network effect and what not
[01:32:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They'd just pay-to-use instead.
[01:32:52] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: it wouldn't prevent it obviously, but I'm saying in this context it's a big factor for why certain services get really big

[01:33:17] <Satin> while no competition ever can occur because of the network effect etc
[01:33:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Not exactly. If no one had ever started offering it "for free", one would still have undercut the others, hit critical mass and cruised on network effect and switching-cost maximization.
[01:33:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Paid offerings also don't mean you don't get datamined as well.
[01:33:58] <Satin> I'm not saying that's not possible, but we certainly did get here
[01:34:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Look at the spyware smart TVs, for example. Or as you can legitimately call them: telecasters.
[01:34:06] <Satin> to the point of being datamined in a massive way
[01:34:08] <Satin> because of it
[01:34:11] <emmeka> something interesting I seen recently is that Viz is dabbling in doing totally DRM-free digital releases on some of their imprints
[01:34:20] <emmeka> and honestly, I buy from them just because that's great
[01:34:21] <Satin> emmeka: that sounds sick
[01:34:51] <emmeka> like you pay them money, they give you a .cbz or .pdf to download, that's it.
[01:34:57] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: obviously part of what i'm saying relies on the idea that there will be vendors, sellers who are interested in good honest business practices
[01:34:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Why are all Arch mirrors outside my country slow and all those in my country overused?
[01:35:15] <Satin> what country
[01:35:19] <MootPoot> ^
[01:35:22] <Satin> emmeka: nice
[01:35:30] <Satin> wait what's a .cbz
[01:35:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: The thing is profit maximization rewards dishonest and manipulative behavior
[01:35:34] <Poeticode> we should create an arch country
[01:35:39] <MootPoot> Satin: archive file
[01:35:42] <MootPoot> I think
[01:35:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: Not USA
[01:35:48] <Satin> that's not specific
[01:35:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Where most of their mirrors are)
[01:35:54] <Satin> Aurora_v_kosmose: i don't disagree, it often happen also
[01:35:57] <emmeka> Satin comic book archive file. Just a way of storing comic book digital documents

[01:36:13] <Satin> but i'm just saying part of the problem is people trading convenience off because it's free

[01:36:15] *** Joins: duds- (~duds-@gateway/tor-sasl/duds)
[01:36:23] <Aurora_v_kosmose> CBR uses a proprietary archive format and should be deprecated.
[01:36:27] <Satin> emmeka: is it any different from .pdf?
[01:36:28] <Poeticode> try using a torrent if arch offers it? maybe it's got enough seeders
[01:36:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: Yes.
[01:36:38] <Satin> how so?
[01:36:41] <Satin> sideways?
[01:36:50] <Satin> rather than documents oriented
[01:36:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's a zip/rar file with metadata packed in and arbitrary quality images packed in.
[01:36:58] <emmeka> Satin yeah. a .cbz or whatever is just actually an archive of image files
[01:37:05] <Satin> Ah.
[01:37:08] * Satin noted
[01:37:08] <emmeka> in such a way that a document reader can make a document out of it
[01:37:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You could put professional scan-tier PNGs in it if you want.
[01:37:22] <Satin> also +1 to the torrent suggestion
[01:37:25] <Satin> often works very well
[01:37:35] <emmeka> Aurora_v_kosmose what's the actual difference between .cbz and .cbr and all that
[01:37:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> CBZ is basically the comic equivalent of EBUP3
[01:37:38] <emmeka> I know there's a few
[01:37:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> emmeka: Mostly/almost-entirely the use of RAR instead of ZIP
[01:38:00] <emmeka> oh.
[01:38:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And RAR is patent-encumbered.
[01:38:37] <emmeka> right.
[01:39:07] <Satin> WinRAR
[01:39:09] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Hmm... something about wikipedia's take seems wrong. Can't be russian. You can't patent algorithms afaik
[01:39:11] <Satin> WinZip

[01:39:24] <Satin> yes you can patent algorithims
[01:39:29] <Satin> wdym you can't
[01:39:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: Russia hasn't gone yet as full-retard about patents as USA
[01:39:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Still not great though, since it still has them)
[01:40:15] <Satin> Oh i have no clue in russia
[01:41:08] <emmeka> huh, there's also .cb7 for 7z and .cbt for tar
[01:41:16] <emmeka> aren't those like true open source
[01:41:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Those are fine, but it's mostly redundant to LZMA-compress images, since most image formats are already compressed.
[01:42:16] <Satin> anyone here use calibre?
[01:42:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> CBZ and CBT are roughly equivalent, as you shoudl set them to not try compress (merely package), since it's useless to try to recompress images.
[01:42:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Satin: Yes.
[01:42:37] <Satin> nice, how is it?
[01:42:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Very convenient.

[01:43:56] <Satin> valid? whatever's convenient for you
[01:43:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Its PDF reader isn't anywhere near as good as its html/epub reader, mainly because it has to transcode and guess at how the PDF should be displayed.

[01:55:17] <MootPoot> So I don't need cheat days
[01:55:43] <MootPoot> All I need to remember is ~800cal 2x a day
[01:55:59] <MootPoot> And no carbs or added sugar
[01:56:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Chicken or fish in a sandwich, pita or wrap, cheese and some sauce, whether mayo or something spicy, tends to be easy to stay under limits and it has the bonus of being cheap & easy to make.

[01:57:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Spicy sauce has benefit of lower calories by default and possibly burning off more from being harder to metabolize.

[03:40:56] <Jigsy> Someone should send that D.A. a bottle of Rittenhouse Rye.
[03:41:01] <Jigsy> Just as an insult to injury.
[04:12:20] <ButterNoodle> lol
[04:12:24] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[04:13:00] <ButterNoodle> Jigsy: maybe an empty bottle, bc I'm sure he drinks either mikes hard lemonades, or appletinis
[04:13:51] <ButterNoodle> Jigsy: my favorite scene of the whole trial was when he swept 3/4 of the courtroom with an ar15... and his finger on the trigger...
[04:14:15] <Jigsy> To be fair, the prosecution did an excellent job of Rittenhouse's defense.
[04:14:41] <Jigsy> [their witness] "Well, he said 'Fuck you!' and reached for the gun."
[04:15:10] <ButterNoodle> I was waiting for him to either get tackled by the bailiff, or him to get the "alec baldwin award for firearm safety"
[04:15:26] <Jigsy> I've hardly done anything this week other than watch Rekeida Law's stream.
[04:15:35] <Jigsy> A bit of Anki wording, but that's about it.
[04:15:49] <Jigsy> Only saw two episodes of Robo Daimidaler.
[04:15:49] <ButterNoodle> I just watched the cliff notes version
[04:16:16] <Jigsy> The Lawyer stream I was watching was a bit disappointed that he couldn't be charged for the gun pointing at the jury.
[04:16:36] <Jigsy> Some special privilage or something.
[04:16:51] <ButterNoodle> yea soem #metoo lawyer privilege..
[04:17:08] <Jigsy> They're hoping him and fatass get disbarred, though.
[04:17:11] <Jigsy> For all the shit they pulled.
[04:17:15] <ButterNoodle> wondering if he will be disbarred
[04:17:20] <ButterNoodle> lol
[04:17:58] <ButterNoodle> yea bet there will be a twitter outcry for that.. and the burning down of cities
[04:18:18] <ButterNoodle> u see the piles of bricks that were delivered?
[04:19:43] <Jigsy> "HOw DARE a JUry NOT LIke MOb ruLe!"
[04:19:49] <Jigsy> No?
[04:20:17] <ButterNoodle> I figured there would be some kind of conviction or mistrial because of all the juror intimidation
[04:21:53] <Jigsy> I'm glad MSNBC got banned from the court.
[04:22:01] <ButterNoodle> that was some funny shit
[04:22:32] <Jigsy> Ended up watching two videos about the Byron Smith killings.
[04:22:37] <Jigsy> That was some dark shit.
[04:22:43] <ButterNoodle> woah
[04:22:51] <Jigsy> His interrogation and the 30m clip of him killing the two kids.
[04:24:14] <ButterNoodle> hmm

[04:24:49] <Jigsy> This.
[04:25:39] <ButterNoodle> thats suck a grey area.. there was another case where people always broke in and assaulted the elderly couple that lived there, and robbed them... he had a shotgun ready when they kicked in his door and smoked em
[04:25:43] <ButterNoodle> he got some time...
[04:25:48] <ButterNoodle> but
[04:26:00] <Jigsy> Well, this case he was lying in wait with a shotgun, a cooler full of snacks...
[04:26:06] <ButterNoodle> byron smith seemed to be looking to "teach them a life lesson"
[04:26:12] <Jigsy> Also moved his car to make it appear as if his house was empty.
[04:26:18] <ButterNoodle> yea
[04:26:19] <Jigsy> Not really self-defense at that point.
[04:26:25] <ButterNoodle> true
[04:26:26] <Jigsy> Especially when you execute them,
[04:26:54] <ButterNoodle> that kinda is entrapment and execution..
[04:27:00] <Jigsy> Yeah.
[04:27:22] <Jigsy> And the creepy... Norman Bates style justification on the tape... hell, even the tape itself... not really a good thing.
[04:27:49] <ButterNoodle> they precedence turns into being shot for walking on someones property or being in someones "stand ur ground" zone

[06:26:09] <tcsilver> lol.... i used to code game demos with a guy from EA, a guy from lucas arts and a guy from blizzard and a guy from marvel&DC, and someone from gravity games and someone from westwood studios

[06:26:23] <tcsilver> from places like sony and disney and so on

[06:28:26] <Sadale> tcsilver, Just so you know I'll probably start developing a new minimalistic hardware game console next year. It isn't about making money tho. :3
[06:28:51] <tcsilver> oh good... would you let me help ? :)
[06:29:00] <tcsilver> I have some notes from our opensource consoles we worked on
[06:29:40] <tcsilver> a Finnish coder with some roxio people were working on it with me... and the aussie coder
[06:29:44] <tcsilver> he had one too
[06:29:48] <tcsilver> I want to help :)
[06:29:52] <Sadale> tcsilver, why not? I was about to ask that. xD
[06:30:00] <tcsilver> hehehe, it would be awesome!
[06:30:35] <tcsilver> I'll start studying for it then!
[06:30:45] <tcsilver> who else is involved ?
[06:31:09] <Sadale> tcsilver, actually this project had been suspended for a few years due to extraordinary circumstances. Here's how the latest prototype looks like before it was suspended: https://secret.sadale.net/blog-assets/GGJ2019/gameConsole.jpg

[06:31:15] <Sadale> tcsilver, only me is involved xD
[06:31:42] <Sadale> That's how it works here. I pretty much do everything alone. Anyway I can't really resume this project right now because I've got another project on hand. :-(
[06:31:43] <tcsilver> I don't want any profits I just want to help :3
[06:31:49] <tcsilver> it looks awesome
[06:32:05] <ButterNoodle> I wanna know about that cat game in the walled city
[06:32:06] <tcsilver> me too.. I'm working on my second mmo
[06:32:11] <Sadale> tcsilver, thanks. I'll let you know if there's any update. :3 Please expect to wait for like half a year until an update tho
[06:32:13] <ButterNoodle> I think they just stopped working on it
[06:32:33] <Sadale> Sad. So many abaondoned projects.
[06:32:41] <tcsilver> yeah

[06:39:27] <tcsilver> yes aaa :D
[06:40:03] <Sadale> tcsilver, resolution: 128x64 monochrome. Microcontroller: I'm looking at ESP-C3 for now but it may be changed. Programming language: C, might support others later on. HTML5 export: The games made for the console will support HTML5 export. I'll port the low level library calls so that the games can run on a computer. Then perhaps I could use emscripten to make it run on a browser.
[06:40:49] <tcsilver> ok : )
[06:40:56] <Sadale> tcsilver, anyway many thing are still subject to changes. I haven't even started to working on it since I've suspended the project :P

[10:30:18] <MootPoot> the compiler or whatever still cant do simple multithreading on its own

[10:35:04] * Sadale programmer xD
[10:35:09] <ButterNoodle> far cry
[10:35:13] <jessedesu_onaph> People say I'm smart but I don't program
[10:35:18] <MootPoot> programmers are smart like in the same way your microwave is smart
[10:35:24] <MootPoot> they can do some stuff on their own
[10:35:26] <Satin> jessedesu_onaph: yeah? there's no one way to be smart?
[10:35:26] <Sadale> Clearly I'm smarter than Satin. I'm so smart in a way that I'd bite Satin for calling me dumb. :P
[10:35:32] <MootPoot> but at the end of the day they're just a microwave
[10:35:36] <Satin> in the end i just respect people who focus on their craft and put in the effort
[10:35:41] <MootPoot> woah
[10:35:43] <Satin> who know their shit
[10:35:47] <MootPoot> do I have respecc from Sadale 
[10:35:50] <MootPoot> and Satin 
[10:35:55] <Satin> and i respect people who might not put effort into that, but who have strong good coherent meta ideas
[10:36:01] <ButterNoodle> yes
[10:36:04] <ButterNoodle> simpler is better
[10:36:10] <MootPoot> flat is justice
[10:36:17] <jessedesu_onaph> I want mutual respect
[10:36:18] <Satin> MootPoot: not till you learn how to use arch /joke
[10:36:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> > The study found that the non-expert tended to write divide-and-conquer algorithms with one go statement per recursion, while the expert wrote distribute-work-synchronize programs using one goroutine per processor. The expert's programs were usually faster, but also longer.[95] | Well yes, the thread-per-connection model was demonstrated to be shit by Apache's web's server a while ago.
[10:36:24] <ButterNoodle> I dont need my toilet to be iot

[10:36:54] <Satin> I don't think anyone really respects me so i'm not a source for advice on that ig, though i have some friends that take me seriously
[10:36:57] <Sadale> MootPoot, hmm. I don't put much thought on if I'm respecting certain users here. Anyway you're a decent guy. Hopefully you can marry a decent girl like Satin at later point of your life. :3
[10:37:05] <MootPoot> woah

[10:37:32] <MootPoot> she's a furry with a computerized suit
[10:37:40] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ease of implementing concurrency/parallelism doesn't mean you can just get away with no understanding of the matter
[10:37:42] <ButterNoodle> I dont want a decent girl

[10:38:44] <MootPoot> I want to date a girl
[10:38:45] <MootPoot> legit

[10:39:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: CSP model makes it simpler and cleaner to implement, but fundamentally the design of the program matters.
[10:39:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, don't worry about multithreading unless you absolutely need it.

[10:41:43] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sadale: But yes, shitty language design has previously led to the advice of disregarding concurrent programming.
[10:41:47] <nexiana> Sadale: funny for you but it gives me slight anxiety
[10:41:50] <ButterNoodle> I would like one cute lil sister to teach about each others bodies

[10:42:13] <Sadale> I'd miss messages as well. xD
[10:42:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sadale: Considering how cheap processors scale much faster on adding more cores than making them faster and that this is only getting worse, that's not a good thing.

[10:43:19] <MootPoot> nexiana is just weird now
[10:43:24] <nexiana> xd
[10:43:40] <Sadale> Just using a single core of this kind of system can be good enough
[10:43:46] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sadale: It also leads to issues with blocking code.
[10:44:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A single core is fine, I'm saying that doing away with concurrency isn't.

[10:50:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> My long term bet is on OpenPower
[10:50:15] <MootPoot> not everyone will buy anything
[10:50:22] <MootPoot> but openpower?
[10:50:33] <MootPoot> if it was actually affordable
[10:50:49] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: is that an open source power PC?
[10:51:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> x86 is a mess, ARM is patent/NDA/bullshit encumbered, RISCV is encumbered by pro-corposcum practices by RISC-V Foundation (such as problems with extending) and is a useless toy without extensions...
[10:51:44] <amigojapan> Aurora_v_kosmose: maybe if motherboards stay coming with FPGAs
[10:52:04] <MootPoot> but just getting your hands on a OpenPower system is $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
[10:52:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: amigojapan: Well, right now few companies make affordable stuff, but for example Libre-SOC is going the Power9 way
[10:52:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And Libre-SOC doesn't intend on making high-power high-end CPUs first. That'd be a nice to have for later.

[10:53:50] <amigojapan> Open source softcore
[10:56:41] <amigojapan> MootPoot: that is exactly what an FPGA is for, so you can load different circuits including CPUs on them by software
[10:56:55] <MootPoot> yes, but like
[10:57:26] <MootPoot> getting an fpga of that size and power to be able to compete in performance making a softcore against a current x86 chip sounds very far fetche

[10:58:20] <amigojapan> No idea. I think they design things like x86 and arm using FPGAs

[11:15:44] <nexiana> Sadale: yeah? depends on what component tho
[11:15:50] <Sadale> but how?
[11:15:58] <Aurora_v_kosmose> nexiana: Still a vast improvement over default Gnome, I'll grant that.
[11:16:03] <nexiana> a lot of things are switchable moving parts i bet
[11:16:05] <nexiana> Aurora_v_kosmose: mhm
[11:16:07] <MootPoot> what specs do I need to run arch linux 
[11:16:11] <MootPoot> is 64gb of ram enough
[11:16:12] <nexiana> none
[11:16:13] <Sadale> If they're using the same package manager, it may not be too difficult like debian vs ubuntu vs pop
[11:16:14] <nexiana> 1 GB
[11:16:26] <Sadale> But if they use different package managers, how?
[11:16:27] <MootPoot> is a 24 thread cpu enough

[11:26:15] <MootPoot> Sadale: is there a way to do it without the chip
[11:26:26] <MootPoot> I dont mind buying it - I just need 1 more analog
[11:26:32] <tcsilver> I think so amigojapan. I don't feel well.
[11:26:36] <MootPoot> theres a bunch of spare digital pins
[11:26:49] <MootPoot> and performance isen't a concern
[11:26:54] <Sadale> MootPoot, I doubt that it'd be possible. Either use ADC multiplexing chip or an external interface chip. :(
[11:27:02] <Sadale> MootPoot, Why do you need two ADCs anyway?
[11:27:33] <amigojapan> Ouch sleep well tcsilver 
[11:27:50] <tcsilver> thanks amigojapan!
[11:27:59] <tcsilver> I'll go rest and watch tv.
[11:28:03] <tcsilver> skyfall was on earlier
[11:28:38] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh if you've for many spare digital pins, you might be able to somehow obtain the ADC value by using multiple digital pins. Let me look up info online

[11:29:22] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh. That's I2C. Not ADC.
[11:29:43] <MootPoot> its plugged into the analog in tho
[11:29:47] <MootPoot> if you look at the diagram
[11:29:48] <Sadale> MootPoot, The Arduino's ADC pins just happen to be multiplexed with the I2C pins. That's why you see A4 and A5.
[11:29:54] <MootPoot> oh
[11:30:13] <Sadale> If you're using ESP8266, you need to use the I2C pins. Anyway I think they're emulating I2C with software or something. Nevertheless it should work.
[11:30:28] <amigojapan> MootPoot: analog pins can be set to digital pin mode

[11:31:18] <MootPoot> 4th
[11:31:36] <Sadale> MootPoot, yep. Look at those SCL and SDA pins there. Just use them.
[11:31:46] <Sadale> MootPoot, GPIO4 and GPIO5
[11:32:05] <MootPoot> now I need a super short wire
[11:32:06] <MootPoot> hmm
[11:32:36] * Sadale checks the voltage level of BME280 and see if it's compatible with ESP8266
[11:32:45] <MootPoot> should be 5v
[11:33:11] <MootPoot> previous link showed the dude powering it via the 5v on the arduino
[11:33:27] <Sadale> MootPoot, weird. It should be up to 3.6V .
[11:33:59] <amigojapan> MootPoot: is the kind of guy who is always wrong
[11:34:07] <nexiana> calm
[11:34:11] <nexiana> down
[11:34:30] <Sadale> MootPoot, apparently this one has 5V to 3.3V regulator on the board. So you can use either 3.3V or 5V: https://www.amazon.com/Adafruit-BME280-Temperature-Humidity-Pressure/dp/B013W1AJUY
[11:34:41] <ImoutoBot> [error] Malformed Response
[11:34:52] <amigojapan> Ok he was not wrong then
[11:35:00] <MootPoot> well there is the 3.3v output as well on the board
[11:35:04] <MootPoot> so I could just use that
[11:35:24] <Sadale> MootPoot, Anyway as long as you aren't using 5V power supply, you should be safe. For ESP8266, I don't think it's 5V-tolerant. So don't supply the BME280 with 5V. Make sure that you're supplying 3.3V.
[11:35:54] <Sadale> hold on. let me think again.
[11:36:02] <MootPoot> well the wemos d1 board I'm using is powered with a simple usb micro b
[11:36:05] <MootPoot> 5v in
[11:36:24] <Sadale> yeah that's it. If you're supplying 3.3V it's highly unlikely that the BME280 module would be outputting 5V to damage the ESP8266. So you'd be safe.
[11:36:47] <Sadale> MootPoot, it's ok. It has a voltage regulator to convert the 5V into 3.3V before feeding it to the ESP8266.
[11:37:15] <ButterNoodle> ..........so 
[11:37:18] <Sadale> MootPoot, so make sure not to feed the 5V to your BME280 module. This way BME280 would just stop working at worst and you won't fire your ESP8266

[11:39:08] <MootPoot> so you know the atomic Pi I was talking about
[11:39:17] <MootPoot> 40 usd intel atom board
[11:39:20] <Sadale> yep
[11:39:23] <MootPoot> yeah so
[11:39:42] <MootPoot> for some reason the makers decided to not have a barrel jack or a usb power input on it
[11:39:52] <Sadale> wut?
[11:39:58] <Sadale> That's dumb.
[11:40:11] <Sadale> MootPoot, I thought that the purchase link you've sent me has a brarrel jack
[11:40:13] <MootPoot> so you either have to buy their overpriced breakout board ( 20 or 40 dollars more depending on the model )
[11:40:19] <MootPoot> OR
[11:40:29] <MootPoot> you simply power it from the 5v headers
[11:40:35] <MootPoot> next to the gpio
[11:41:03] <MootPoot> kinda lame
[11:41:10] <Sadale> hmm. You want to have a reliable cable then :P
[11:41:19] <Sadale> I mean cable with reliable connection.
[11:41:34] <MootPoot> I got a 40w 5v adapter
[11:41:39] <MootPoot> wire it up with duponts
[11:41:49] <MootPoot> but anyway - the 67 price tag is now effectively like
[11:41:54] <MootPoot> 90 
[11:42:00] <Sadale> The easy way to "fix" that would be get a USB cable and a phone charger, cut the USB cable, stripe the power wires inside the cable and crimp dupont headers onto it and plug the wires with dupont header into the GPIO pins./
[11:42:01] <MootPoot> when you include that 
[11:42:17] <Sadale> The thing is that dupont cables aren't quite reliable. They get loose over time :/
[11:42:24] <MootPoot> Sadale: I thought about that but idk how usb delivers power
[11:42:37] <MootPoot> usb caps at 15w 
[11:42:41] <MootPoot> at 5v
[11:42:52] <Sadale> MootPoot, wait. How much power does the atomic pi need?
[11:42:53] <Sadale> max power
[11:43:07] <MootPoot> min  = 5v3a , ideal 5v4a
[11:43:14] <Sadale> that's a lot :/
[11:43:20] <MootPoot> its a x86 board
[11:43:27] <MootPoot> its not going to be like a rpi
[11:43:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, You got a brarrel jack power supply tho?
[11:44:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ah, Golang made the same mistake as everything else in implementing methods/interfaces.
[11:44:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> (Everything else except CL)
[11:45:22] <MootPoot> Sadale: I ordered one
[11:45:33] <Sadale> MootPoot, nice. Did you order their breakout board tho? xD
[11:46:06] <Sadale> MootPoot, if you can wait, and if you've got a power supply, I may be willing to help making a brarrel jack to GPIO converter board just for you. I guess they should be easy to design. But definitely not right now so you'd have to wait. And it takes time to get delivered (usually up to a month via airmail from Hong Kong SAR to Canada)
[11:46:09] <MootPoot> nah fuck that
[11:46:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A given type/structure implements an interface, which is the wrong way to go about it. Interfaces should be generic functions you can specialize for an arbitrary number of arguments.
[11:46:28] <MootPoot> Sadale: their board costs 20 at least and then I'd still need a power supply
[11:46:42] <MootPoot> I got a 40w 5v supply for the same price
[11:46:47] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh or even you could learn designing it on your own. PCB design for simply stuffs isn't as difficult as you thought :3
[11:47:05] <MootPoot> yeah
[11:47:13] <MootPoot> for now at least I'll just run it via the gpio
[11:47:31] <MootPoot> it might have been better if I got the nvidia jetson
[11:47:36] <Sadale> MootPoot, ah. how do you connect the PSU with the gpio tho?
[11:48:08] <Sadale> 5V at 4A is a lot. Dupont cables may not be able to handle that
[11:48:16] <MootPoot> Sadale:  dupont on the board side , and it has screw in connectors for naked wires
[11:48:24] <MootPoot> Sadale: well you need to power it using 4 duponts
[11:48:29] <Sadale> hmm
[11:48:30] <Sadale> That may work
[11:48:40] <MootPoot> 2 for 5v and 2 for grnd

[12:59:25] <MootPoot> Jokes aside it has less then other architectures in pretty much everything
[12:59:32] <MootPoot> Including average power consumption
[12:59:46] <JesseDesu> so why is it popular
[12:59:55] <MootPoot> Cheap
[12:59:55] <JesseDesu> theres something to it right
[12:59:58] <MootPoot> Low power 
[13:00:07] <MootPoot> That's mainly it

[13:00:48] <MootPoot> The smallest arm chips eat like 0.3milliwatts

[13:01:43] <DunceCotus> arm chippies
[13:02:04] <Disconsented> eh less power consumption is misleading
[13:02:27] <Disconsented> they'd traded off area, frequency, IO and a bleeding edge node
[13:02:50] <Disconsented> But in spite of that, scaled down alder lake and Zen3's performance is comparable

[16:19:14] <MootPoot> so if you dont buy into "cute girl romance ( with some degree of self-insert )" you wont like it as much 
[16:19:20] <Satin> amigojapan: i see
[16:19:31] <Satin> MootPoot: ahh, thanks for the honest description

[16:28:15] <amigojapan> Lol
[16:28:23] <amigojapan> Let me take a look
[16:29:27] <Cryowolf> I left shame behind me
[16:29:42] <Cryowolf> I really need money, even for hobby stuff cause all the cancer costs have taken it all
[16:29:50] <Cryowolf> and now I have nothing to even have fun with
[16:30:04] <MootPoot> you still have your ochinchin
[16:30:19] <Cryowolf> like buy new stuff. Upgrade graphic card, assuming they ever get a normal cost
[16:30:29] <MootPoot> geforce now
[16:30:29] <Cryowolf> buy a new tv, my old one is losing colors
[16:31:00] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, it wont run good settings and it will lag on occasion, to run the best one that doesnt limit playtime as much will also cost too much for me
[16:31:04] <darkwitch> wow, is it turning black and white?
[16:31:30] <Cryowolf> I'd rather have a graphic card, once they have a realistic pricing. Then I can run anything
[16:31:35] <MootPoot> what do you mean good settings
[16:31:40] <darkwitch> I don't even have a tv
[16:31:44] <Cryowolf> medium, high, ultra
[16:31:46] <MootPoot> they have like banks for 3070s or 3080s
[16:32:19] <Cryowolf> one subscription has a 3070 and one as 3080 but it still doesnt run games higher than low or medium-ow
[16:32:19] <MootPoot> All you have to do is save and restart
[16:32:21] <Cryowolf> low
[16:32:24] <MootPoot> its not hard
[16:32:48] <Cryowolf> It might also lag and it restricts you to X hours per day
[16:32:53] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I don't go to clubs, always hated them
[16:32:56] <Cryowolf> you might also end up in a queue
[16:33:02] <Cryowolf> to play
[16:33:06] <MootPoot> so?
[16:33:15] <Cryowolf> so I dont want that
[16:33:17] <MootPoot> all of these are pretty minor problems
[16:33:36] <MootPoot> this is a real beggars can't be choosers area you're in
[16:33:37] <darkwitch> amigojapan, you are in the Go Home club
[16:33:55] <Cryowolf> no, the lag ruins the experience, the restriction ruins the experience, the queue makes it so I might have to wait a long time to play
[16:33:56] <amigojapan> Yup darkwitch lol
[16:34:32] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, That's not the thing. Im saying I don't want it, I'm not saying anyone has to give me anything else
[16:34:39] <MootPoot> eh
[16:34:39] <MootPoot> ok
[16:34:43] <MootPoot> do what you want
[16:35:29] <Cryowolf> yes, why would I buy something for games I will buy in the future, to stream them with lag and on medium low settings? All games I own right now, Ican play
[16:35:47] <MootPoot> oh
[16:35:54] <MootPoot> I thought you didnt have a gpu
[16:35:58] <MootPoot> and couldnt play anything
[16:36:03] <Cryowolf> game pass ultimate cloud gaming however, thats something I have and enjoy. Cause it gives you games you don't have
[16:36:29] <Cryowolf> no, I need something to play future games since my gpu generation is being left behind now
[16:37:07] <Cryowolf> Im not asking anyone in specific to pay for that. I would likely prioritise other things anyway
[16:37:14] <Cryowolf> like a new microwave that works
[16:38:02] <Cryowolf> a television from black friday to replace mine that's losing color and stuff, creating artifacts that arent in the source
[16:38:28] <Cryowolf> maybe a new couch (2nd hand)
[16:38:43] <Cryowolf> 'they should be cheap 2nd hand
[16:40:00] <Cryowolf> but I havent asked for donations for any of that because Im not sure if I should. Like what can I ask for donations for in my condition, because I can't afford it? Where is the line?
[16:41:32] <darkwitch> the donations are for you to spend on whatever you want
[16:42:00] <Cryowolf> no first my donations were specified for cancer costs, either surrounding, direct or ermergency
[16:42:12] <Cryowolf> to pay for hospital bills not ever by healthcare highcost
[16:42:16] <Cryowolf> ever = covered
[16:42:19] *** Joins: sagax (~sagax_nb@user/sagax)
[16:43:09] <darkwitch> it doesn't have to be that way
[16:43:28] <Cryowolf> if I change donations, what can I ask for? Because I don't want to use my cancer as a crutch for things...like "Look I have cancer, so you have to give me stuff". I'm in need of financial help, large part of it is cause I have cancer. But the financial help wouldn't be for treatment costs
[16:43:38] <Cryowolf> it would be for everything else on the side
[16:44:01] <MootPoot> once I got second hand rejected
[16:44:06] <MootPoot> by a girl
[16:44:09] <darkwitch> anything works. anything at all

[17:07:37] <MootPoot> do you think a nvidia jetson could run that

[17:07:50] <potatoxel[m]> k-lined as in?
[17:08:19] <Sadale> potatoxel[m], k-line means that Libera staffs had made a network-wide ban.
[17:08:36] <potatoxel[m]> o
[17:08:55] <MootPoot> Sadale: then run that desktop on something like this https://www.amazon.ca/TCL-Class-Dolby-Vision-Google/dp/B0979T9DKD/

[17:16:51] <Sadale> Bco1981, I wouldn't mind at all
[17:16:52] <Bco1981> look at the eyes... it's Marine
[17:16:55] <potatoxel[m]> MootPoot: thats not the issue. If they control your tv, i.e you cannot change the programs on ur TV. then i dont consider that as owning a device.
[17:17:02] <Sadale> MootPoot, electricity cost tho
[17:17:11] <MootPoot> Sadale: dirt cheap power
[17:17:12] <MootPoot> here
[17:17:22] <potatoxel[m]> essentially its a few issues
[17:17:36] <MootPoot> my room uses like about 1000w constantly
[17:17:39] <potatoxel[m]> control over ur device. privacy. etc..
[17:17:40] <MootPoot> between everything
[17:17:47] <MootPoot> and at the end of the month the price is like
[17:17:50] <MootPoot> 1 mcdonalds meal
[17:18:04] <JesseDesu> i sleep now
[17:18:04] <potatoxel[m]> ok then the other issue is, its ur device
[17:18:10] <potatoxel[m]> slep
[17:18:13] <potatoxel[m]> good slep to u

[17:20:26] <Sadale> MootPoot, it adds up.
[17:20:49] <potatoxel[m]> Sadale: ok price is a side issue
[17:20:57] <potatoxel[m]> the main issue for me is control over my own devices
[17:21:00] <MootPoot> wow
[17:21:01] <MootPoot> so cheap
[17:21:10] <Sadale> MootPoot, having a mcdonald meal once every month for a year is like $120. That'd be even more expensive that a Jetson
[17:21:15] <potatoxel[m]> if i dont want it to send telemetry
[17:21:17] <potatoxel[m]> then it shouldnt
[17:21:24] <Sadale> potatoxel[m], yep.
[17:21:27] <potatoxel[m]> ur a mcdonalds
[17:21:30] <MootPoot> Sadale: 4k monitor that is 27 inches is only 270 cad
[17:22:13] <MootPoot> damn
[17:22:20] <Sadale> MootPoot, exactly. You're saying that mining on your TV would cost you the price of a mcdonal meal per month. Assuming a mcdonalds meal is $10, running it for a year would be $120.
[17:22:54] <MootPoot> no
[17:23:03] <MootPoot> what I said is all of my electronics 
[17:23:11] <MootPoot> cost me the price of a mcdonalds meal
[17:23:13] <Sadale> oh.
[17:23:15] <Sadale> ok
[17:23:15] <MootPoot> not just mining
[17:23:17] <Sadale> fair enough
[17:23:26] <MootPoot> so we are counting my 1000w computer
[17:23:31] <MootPoot> and 7 other computers
[17:23:35] <MootPoot> and rgb lights
[17:23:41] <MootPoot> network equipment

[17:23:59] <MootPoot> Sadale: electricity here is about 0.07 dollars per kwh
[17:24:11] <Sadale> MootPoot, that's... cheap
[17:24:15] <MootPoot> !c 0.07 CAD to HKD

[17:24:24] * MootPoot spanks ImoutoBot 
[17:24:25] <Sadale> MootPoot, here we're like double of that

[17:24:43] <Sadale> ~$0.15 per kwh
[17:24:51] <MootPoot> thats more then double
[17:24:53] <Sadale> MootPoot, just use USD :P
[17:25:03] <Sadale> State the unit in USD and I can convert it on my own
[17:25:07] <MootPoot> so like I pay 0.05 dollars per kwh
[17:25:07] <MootPoot> about
[17:25:12] <Sadale> lucky you
[17:25:14] <MootPoot> 1/3 your price
[17:25:34] <MootPoot> you see why electricity cost is like dropping loose change
[17:25:35] <MootPoot> for me
[17:25:59] <Sadale> makes sense
[17:26:12] <Sadale> I'm not the one who's paying for the electricity tho. My parents do. xD
[17:26:22] <Sadale> But still I do take them into account when buying stuffs.
[17:27:09] <MootPoot> well, in this house
[17:27:16] <MootPoot> its basically me and my pops
[17:27:25] <MootPoot> I earn about 2500 a month
[17:27:34] <MootPoot> and he earns like 7000 or so
[17:27:43] <Sadale> wow.
[17:27:46] <Sadale> Who are the pops?
[17:27:50] <MootPoot> pops
[17:27:52] <MootPoot> my dad

[17:30:02] <Sadale> Mine's like a kid. Always get angry and yell at shit :/

[17:30:13] <MootPoot> ah
[17:30:17] <MootPoot> yeah my dad is just like me
[17:30:19] <MootPoot> sit on PC all day
[17:30:21] <MootPoot> chill
[17:30:23] <Sadale> MootPoot, lucky you
[17:30:32] <Sadale> do appreciate it.
[17:30:56] <Sadale> I'm not sure how long I could tolerate my stupid dad that I'd have to move out. Of course that'd delay my retirement plan.
[17:30:58] <MootPoot> although we have our own problem ssometimes
[17:31:42] <Sadale> yeah it's ok. as long as he isn't the kind of people would love to keep escalating shit it's ok.
[17:31:50] <MootPoot> nah
[17:31:56] <MootPoot> when we have issues
[17:31:58] <Sadale> like trying to take the last word to win a stupid argument
[17:32:02] <MootPoot> usually we just stop talking 
[17:32:03] <MootPoot> for a week
[17:32:04] <Matt|home> ... can't tell if stomach pain from earlier diet.. or just bad luck.. 
[17:32:06] <Sadale> makes sense

[17:32:33] <Sadale> and my mom
[17:33:57] <MootPoot> Sadale:

[17:33:59] <MootPoot> gimme ur discord
[17:34:07] <Sadale> MootPoot, why?
[17:34:11] <Sadale> MootPoot, I barely use it
[17:34:12] <MootPoot> y noy
[17:34:16] <MootPoot> y not
[17:34:18] <MootPoot> well
[17:34:24] <Berlin36> y nut
[17:34:25] <MootPoot> mainly its much easier to send pics
[17:34:27] <Sadale> MootPoot, I barely use it. Getting my discord would gain you nothing
[17:34:30] <MootPoot> thats basically it
[17:34:36] <MootPoot> sending images on irc is a pain
[17:34:45] <Sadale> MootPoot, sorry. It isn't worth giving you discord to me. You can send pics to me via telegram tho
[17:34:50] <Sadale> if you've got one
[17:35:20] <MootPoot> ecchi
[17:35:25] <MootPoot> we're sharing phone numbers
[17:35:30] <MootPoot> we might start sexting soon
[17:35:58] <MootPoot> telegram?
[17:36:17] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh no need to share phone numbers for telegram. Just the user handle
[17:36:28] <MootPoot> oh I was just wondering about that
[17:36:31] <MootPoot> I have signal
[17:36:40] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh I don't have it yet. But I could register one
[17:36:49] <MootPoot> I dont mind sharing numbers - I just forgot telegram and signal were different
[17:36:53] <Sadale> lol
[17:37:06] <MootPoot> for a second I was like telegram??? what that
[17:38:12] <Sadale> MootPoot, well will ping you if I register a signal account
[17:39:08] <MootPoot> biggest downside of irc tbh
[17:39:14] <MootPoot> just how annoying it is to share pics
[17:39:39] <MootPoot> I have too many messaging apps
[17:40:52] <Sadale> MootPoot, haha. I've got a website taking care of my image sharing need
[17:40:58] <Sadale> But only I've got access to me.
[17:40:59] <Sadale> But only I've got access to it*
[17:41:08] <MootPoot> I did that once but its a pain

[17:44:48] <Sadale> oh actually IRC technically supports file transfer between clients. But that never worked on freenode.
[17:44:50] <Sadale> Not sure on Libera.
[17:45:02] <MootPoot> I'm honestly thinking about just getting that 27" display
[17:45:02] <Sadale> File transfer works on some IRC networks
[17:45:03] <MootPoot> instead
[17:45:09] <MootPoot> as my billboard
[17:45:26] <MootPoot> much cheaper, but then I wont have massive in-bedroom hentai solution

[17:45:52] <Sadale> so honest. I like it

[18:47:00] <Sadale> you tested that?
[18:47:05] <MootPoot> bah
[18:47:05] <Bco1981> yeah
[18:47:09] <MootPoot> 265?
[18:47:18] <Bco1981> the specs say it can, but it can't
[18:47:24] <Bco1981> barely 1080p60
[18:47:34] <MootPoot> darn it

[18:47:55] <Sadale> Bco1981, that spec's lying
[18:48:14] <Sadale> lucky me. I don't have a 4k screen
[18:48:31] <Bco1981> it has a hardware decoder chip, but for some reason it does not work, like you would expect.
[18:48:45] <Sadale> ah. lack of software support?
[18:48:53] <Bco1981> probably
[18:49:06] <Sadale> Not even offline vid can work at 4k 60fps?
[18:49:14] <Bco1981> nope
[18:49:16] <Sadale> I think they've got a gpu-accelerated video playuer
[18:49:33] <Sadale> does that one work?
[18:49:35] <Bco1981> raspian comes with VLC, that can not do it
[18:49:40] <Sadale> I see.
[18:49:49] <Bco1981> mpv can use 1080p60 in fullscreen
[18:49:54] <Bco1981> not in window mode
[18:49:58] <Sadale> hmm
[18:50:34] <Sadale> found. It's called omxplayer
[18:50:45] <isekaijin> Good morning, onii-chans.
[18:50:53] <Bco1981> is that a package in raspbian ?
[18:51:07] <isekaijin> Actually, not necessarily good, just hopefully better than mine.
[18:51:14] <Sadale> Bco1981, probably
[18:51:54] <Bco1981> will look at it tomorrow
[18:51:56] <Sadale> Bco1981, anyway I won't have high hope on raspberry pi running 4k 60fps smoothly. Its SoC is a piece of shit :P
[18:52:23] <Bco1981> it has ha decoder for that, it should be able to

[18:52:57] <Sadale> only if it has software support for that
[18:53:07] <Sadale> anyway maybe this omxplayer would work :3
[18:53:46] <Sadale> I honestly don't get why gpu support on linux would be that bad for those ARM chips.
[18:54:09] <Sadale> iGPU works well for Intel and AMD CPU on linux
[18:54:42] <Bco1981> the gpu is a mobile chip, performance isn't on par i think.
[18:54:53] <MootPoot> kind of disappointing tbh
[18:56:11] <Sadale> Bco1981, oh no. I mean software support. For intel or AMD iGPU, you can pretty much do everything on linux with hardware acceleration. The video players supports hardware-accelerated decoding. And almost everything's GPU-accelerated. As for those ARM chips, getting hardware-accelerated stuffs to work in linux would be a pain in the ass
