[01:26:11] <bud> hello bash friends
[01:26:24] <bud> i am experimenting with FIFO stuff
[01:26:40] <bud> i have a script i execute with a global keybinding (i3).
[01:27:13] <bud> and often i do very rapid multiple executions by holding down the keybinding.
[01:27:24] <bud> (the script moves windows).
[01:27:52] <bud> i thought maybe i could use a FIFO to make this work better.
[01:28:10] <bud> i do something like this:
[01:28:33] <bud> [[ -p $fifo ]] && echo $cmd ; exit
[01:29:03] <bud> while read stuff < $fifo ; do stuff... ; done
[01:29:28] <bud> also i have a exit trap that removes the fifo
[01:29:42] <bud> the loop terminates when the fifo is empty.
[01:29:44] <bud> but
[01:29:44] <ormaaj> !mutex
[01:29:45] <greybot> A mutual exclusion lock ensures your script can only be running once. mkdir "$lockdir" && trap 'rm -rf "$lockdir"' EXIT || exit # Another option: exec 9>> "$lockfile" && [[ $({ fuser -f "$lockfile"; } 2>&- 9>&-) == $$ ]] || exit # (fuser also works read-only and cleanup is implicit) See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/045 http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/howto/mutex
[01:29:56] *** Joins: rcernin (~rcernin@188.146.148.122.sta.wbroadband.net.au)
[01:30:44] <bud> this is not just to make sure i have a lock, the main reason i want to do this is to avoid some heavy stuff i do before the while
[01:30:48] <bud> and my question is:
[01:31:21] *** Quits: paulgrmn (~paulgrmn@user/paulgrmn) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[01:31:30] <bud> the loop terminates when fifo is empty, that's good. but sometimes i guess just due to timing, the fifo can be empty but i am still holding the key.
[01:32:00] <bud> i think this would be smoother if there was a way to before i read a line also test how many lines are left.

[01:33:40] <ormaaj> however you're likely better to arrange for some keydown event to kick off one one process / routine that does your message spamming until it's stopped by a keyup. However that is done with that wm on your platform. Rather than spamming script invocations.

[12:54:27] <Soliton> .xinitrc is a config file not a log file.
[12:54:47] <cadmio> so the command should be echo icewm-session > ~/.xinitrc
[12:55:18] <osse> epends on what icewm-session is doing
[12:55:24] <osse> if it's a ".xinitrc generator" then sure
[12:55:32] <cadmio> I found it here: https://ice-wm.org/FAQ/
[12:56:05] <Soliton> you're confused.
[12:57:15] <cadmio> why?
[12:57:27] <Soliton> you tell me.
[12:58:28] <cadmio> I think I've to rename after the command the .log file to the bare .xinitrc 
[12:58:49] <osse> you're supposed to create a .xinitrc with that as the content
[12:58:50] <Soliton> well, do whatever you like. nothing to do with shell either way.

[13:02:01] <osse> cadmio: you're supposed to create a .xinitrc with that as the content
[13:02:02] <Soliton> but sure you can second guess the official site and try random stuff.

[14:29:54] <user217_> @kurahaupo this is output of debug in docker. And may be it related to GO-language (because all code is in GO)
[14:29:55] <kurahaupo> If it's a command, maybe it's a wireshark dump of a protobuf

[14:31:31] <user217_> yep. I check protobuf
[14:31:35] <user217_> thatnks
[14:31:55] <kurahaupo> user217_: it's part of the command. And by "command", I mean an RPC function call, probably encoded as a protobuf
[14:33:08] <kurahaupo> everything from «command:"» to «" ]» is one long string of bytes

[16:42:47] <alzgh> `cat -n out.txt | sort -k2 -k1n  | uniq -f1 | sort -nk1,1 | cut -f2-` This is a solution I found online. It outputs uniqe lines and keeps the relative ordering of the original file. I just don't understand why they use `sort -nk1,1` after the third pipe. Specifically I don't understand what `,1` at the end is supposed to do.

[18:58:12] <asvln> There are a bunch of scripting languages which already almost mirror rust, but the grammer I have laid out is unlike any other language I've encountered.
[18:59:25] <asvln> The thought of just using macros to write the language, and run scripts as compiled binaries through rustc/Cargo came about naturally.
[18:59:56] <selckin> piping is the most important feature and you don't have it

[19:16:31] <asvln> phy1729, do you have an idea how this could be written with an indented syntax and still be readable?
[19:17:00] <llua> so like, this is off topic
[19:17:16] <phy1729> asvln: nope, it's just a tarpit
[19:19:01] <asvln> Soliton, it was easy to extend the grammer to provide full scripting capability, but commands are still a 'first class citizen'
[19:19:41] <Soliton> it doesn't look like i can write  cmd  to execute cmd.
[19:20:02] <Soliton> so that's interactive use out the window i guess.

[19:24:38] <asvln> Correct, that is intentional. I dont think a shell needs to have full scripting capabilities. I plan to implement a shell to be a companion to the language which will be dead simple.
[19:26:21] <Soliton> my point is that calling a command is not dead simple.

[19:28:21] <asvln> This depends on your perspective. From the point of view of most 'shell scripting' languages, it is not. But from the point of view of general scripting languages, it is much simpler than most.
[19:28:36] <llua> shells before your have went down this same road before.
[19:28:55] <llua> they become toy projects
[19:28:57] <Soliton> it's either just  cmd  or you're not seriously a shell. i don't think there is much leeway when it comes to the most basic operation.

[19:35:09] <asvln> llua, the language will be for my own use (and contributers) and I have no other motive. If you know any other dead languages which mimic what I've outlined I would be grateful to know their names to research.
[19:36:08] <llua> think of a lang and append "unix like shell" and you will find them, scheme, lisp, ruby, perl, python; they all exist

[23:15:49] <yitz> (GNU?) `rm` has an interactive flag

[23:16:40] <tusko> what is unalias -a
[23:16:48] <armin> tusko: then, if you really know what you're doing, probably what you'll want to do is aliasing rm to 'rm -i', but don't complain if this breaks your expectations as soon as you encounter an rm which isn't aliased to the one with -i.
[23:16:58] <yitz> See  help unalias
[23:17:50] <armin> tusko: well i'll refine that: "unalias rm". i got used to "unalias -a" on redhat/centos/fedora as they by default ship a bashrc that aliases rm to "rm -i" and it annoys the hell out of me.
[23:18:27] <armin> also what yitz said, you'll need "command rm", not "rm" inside the function to avoid an infinite recursion.

[23:46:41] <tirnanog> int: that depends heavily on the use of a GNU userland, by the way.
[23:46:59] <xx> litheum: I'm just asking if there's a difference in functionality between $var != 42 and $var -ne 42
[23:47:32] <greycat> One is a string comparison.  The other is a numeric comparison.  Yes, there is a difference, but only with two strings that both equate to the same integer value.
[23:48:03] <greycat> [ " 42" -eq "42" ] && echo match
[23:48:07] <greycat> # [ " 42" -eq "42" ] && echo match
[23:48:09] <shbot> greycat: match

[23:56:02] <armin> interesting, that one breaks in zsh
