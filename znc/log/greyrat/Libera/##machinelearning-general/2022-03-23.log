[00:01:32] <dostoyevsky2> andrew[m]123: if the model already learned to distinguish 300k kinds of something, fine tuning it to distinguish less cases, especially if they are somehow part of the 300k is quite quick

[01:31:15] <andrew[m]123> Quicker than training a new model with 54,000 images? Why? Because the gradient descent should require fewer steps?
[01:34:17] <andrew[m]123> I considered fine tuning but thought there might be some problems with that: 1) There is intersection between the classes of COCO and the new dataset, but I don't want false positives and items to be mislabeled as part of COCO, 2) while both datasets are images with annotations, the second dataset is more constrained than COCO, it is pictures of food shot from overhead, so perhaps the model will falsely assume it's not
[01:34:18] <andrew[m]123> looking at an overhead food picture shot https://i.imgur.com/BjH4ypx.png 3) COCO may be aware of items that aren't supposed to be labelled (e.g. "table", "hand", "mug")
[01:34:28] <SigmoidFroid>  â‡’  (PNG) No title 1M
[01:36:15] <andrew[m]123> for those reasons, I think transfer learning or training a new model would be the best approach. I'm curious whether re-engineering models source code would even be worth my time since there are 54,000 images to learn, and as I understand it, transfer learning yields the most benefit when you have small datasets of, for example, 100
[01:40:24] <HuntsMan> the most benefit as defined to what?
[01:40:33] <HuntsMan> we use transfer learning for object detection in COCO
[01:42:20] <andrew[m]123> most benefit being the difference between precision of a transfer-learned model and a model from scratch
[01:44:59] <HuntsMan> I don'
[01:45:05] <HuntsMan> I don't think that is true
[01:45:26] <HuntsMan> for object detection, many models diverge if you don't pre-train them on ImageNet (or use pre-trained backbones)
[01:45:36] <andrew[m]123> for example, lets say I'm trying to do instance segmentation with a dataset having 100 images. A brand new model would be terrible and I might get an AP of 5.0, but transfer learning from COCO I might get an AP of 20.0. However if I have have 100,000 images, my fresh model might have an AP of 25.0, and my transfer learned model might have an AP of 30.0
[01:46:07] <HuntsMan> yeah but I don't think that is true
[01:46:10] <andrew[m]123> transfer learning having a greater benefit on the smaller dataset by raising AP by 15.0 vs it raising AP by 5.0 in the larger dataset
[01:46:13] <andrew[m]123> Is there a more technical term for this than benefit?
[01:46:13] <HuntsMan> your model trained from scratch would diverge
[01:46:38] <andrew[m]123> sure
[01:47:34] <HuntsMan> so that means AP = 0.0
[01:47:44] <andrew[m]123> why?
[01:48:00] <andrew[m]123> you mean for the smaller dataset?
[01:48:32] <HuntsMan> your model trained from scratch would diverge <- on COCO, without pre-training or transfer learning
[01:51:03] <andrew[m]123> sure, I am planning on using SWIN trained on imagenet

[02:25:32] <HuntsMan> yeah, without transfer learning
[02:25:39] <HuntsMan> using a pre-trained backbone is also transfer learning
[02:30:12] <andrew[m]123> Ya, that makes sense that it would qualify
