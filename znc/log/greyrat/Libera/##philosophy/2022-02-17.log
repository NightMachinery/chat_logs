[12:02:14] <mrig> sure, but in some circles somewhere it is doing it for someone, common, someone paid 3000 dollars for a picture of a diamond just because it was the most expensive app in the shop, despite it doing nothing.

[12:07:18] <mrig> Which Greek was it who was into the fire element, I forget his name now.
[12:07:21] <mrig> ?
[12:07:36] <anomal> mrig: what do you mean entropy, are you saying NFT art is the evidence of us gradually collapsing to shapeless uniform chaos?
[12:07:59] <mrig> yes pretty much, just heat leaking from the system.
[12:08:06] * anomal becomes 10% more diffuse
[12:08:18] <anomal> Well damn
[12:08:21] <anomal> How do we stop it
[12:08:30] <anomal> Maybe more exposure to low entropy things, like sun
[12:08:41] <anomal> If I go to beach more will I stop seeing NFTs
[12:08:43] <mrig> chaos is not homogeneous though, nor uniform.
[12:08:56] <mrig> it is always present as part of a fractal, is my take.
[12:09:03] <anomal>  Oh my, I think... the universe is a reflection of my own entropy
[12:09:09] <anomal> Trump president, the pandemic.
[12:09:11] <mrig> yes could be.
[12:09:16] <anomal> It's all my own entropy increasing.
[12:09:35] <anomal> mrig: my only joy is I'm not in this alone. You're here.
[12:09:52] <anomal> It means you're in a similarly high entropy state, falling at the hole together with me.
[12:10:01] <anomal> I'll kind of push you in and try to bounce out.
[12:10:08] <anomal> By sending you links to NFTs
[12:10:08] <mrig> entropy just is though, any belief that is increasing is you reflecting your perspective of it.
[12:10:45] <mrig> nice, I love entropy though, am in awe and somewhat hypnotised by her beauty.
[12:11:08] <anomal> mrig: if there's no objective measure of entropy, then there's no objective law of thermodynamics, nor objective arrow of time
[12:11:09] <mrig> I do ascribe the feminine to her.
[12:11:27] <mrig> time does not exist it manifests.
[12:11:33] <anomal> mrig: the feminine is the creation, so it should be low entropy

[12:12:06] <mrig> it is the division of uniformity into discrete measures.

[12:13:07] <mrig> entropy is that which burns inside of me, without which I would be naught but a corps.

[12:14:40] <mrig> Just walk into a wall to see, if you hit it, you can be pretty sure that you are in the room.
[12:14:55] <mrig> careful of your nose though.
[12:15:03] <anomal> Wait, what's a 'nose'
[12:16:07] <anomal> I think I have a door handle, but I can't smell anything with it
[12:16:46] <anomal> Now I feel more like I'm the empty space between space, rather than space.

[12:18:59] <anomal> Or do you keep existing, but the universe stops existing
[12:19:12] <mrig> Since studying indian science most of the SciFi that I come across now days seems somewhat ridiculous.
[12:19:21] <anomal> It unfold and unfolds, like infinitely dimensional origami.
[12:19:26] <inhahe_> I guess A Fire Upon Deep is pretty mindblowing as sci-fi goes. Not that I particularly liked it.
[12:19:39] <anomal> Until you see it becomes an endless flat plane
[12:19:41] <anomal> And then...
[12:19:43] <mrig> patterns tend to repeat, everything is a pattern at some scale.
[12:19:47] <anomal> It folds into something new
[12:19:52] <anomal> And you're born again
[12:20:10] <anomal> Not as a human. Not as anything you could imagine right now.
[12:20:14] <anomal> A new universe, new rules.
[12:20:18] <anomal> But you're a thing again.
[12:20:25] <anomal> Time to learn everything from scratch
[12:20:59] <mrig> I think the feed back loop is way way shorter than that,
[12:21:32] <mrig> The thing is about the theory of reincarnation, is that you have to understand the model of samkya before it can make any sense at all.
[12:21:46] <anomal> inhahe__: thanks I'll check
[12:22:01] <mrig> and ego is only there as a memory store, it is not that which passes on.
[12:22:20] <inhahe_> anderson: it's actually A Fire Upon the Deep, i forgot the "the"
[12:22:34] <anomal> mrig: I don't understand anything, hence why I need to understand nothing in order to know what I need to know.
[12:23:19] <mrig> so, given that the entire physical aspect of the body regenerates and completely replaces itself every few years, this cycles is already happening before death, is a part of life fundamentally.
[12:23:44] <mrig> anomal: I can empathise with that sentiment.
[12:23:47] <anomal> mrig: but it recreates itself the same fundamentally
[12:24:23] <mrig> it is good to know that hot things hurt to the touch though, that kind of thing to make the passage through the cosmos somewhat more agreeable.

[12:24:47] <anomal> Our existence is a knot.
[12:24:48] <mrig> and the birth process is so darned disturbing, you would not want to have to do it too often.
[12:25:01] <anomal> As that knot is untied you see a string.
[12:25:14] <anomal> mrig: is it
[12:25:21] <anomal> why
[12:25:42] <inhahe_> not sure birth could be more disturbing than dying
[12:25:44] <mrig> Ask anyone who has given birth.
[12:25:56] <anomal> inhahe__: what if you're being born as you die
[12:26:03] <anomal> inhahe__: is there distinction
[12:26:06] <mrig> dang the first thing that they do is slap you if you are not crying |:
[12:26:30] <anomal> inhahe__: it's like... we say falling asleep. We don't say "we die, and are born in a dream"
[12:26:53] <anomal> We fall into rebirth
[12:27:03] <mrig> inhahe_: I suspect that it does depend a great deal upon circumstance, that death could really go either way.
[12:27:13] <inhahe_> yeah true
[12:27:18] <inhahe_>  a shot to the head probably isn't so bad
[12:27:23] <anomal> I hope in the next universe I am in there's no reality TV, sports and politicsw
[12:28:07] <mrig> I don't know, if it was just when you were on the verge of realising the reason for it all and it nips you in the bud before the thought flowers, could be pretty frustrating.
[12:28:26] <anomal> Are we trapped in life
[12:28:30] <plankster> i hope in the next universe theres no food
[12:28:34] <anomal> Is this slavery

[12:29:31] <anomal> mrig: what you see right now is just a projection.
[12:29:40] <anomal> It's reality, but the way you see it is entirely yours
[12:29:45] <anomal> It doesn't exist.
[12:29:56] <mrig> thinking that the multiverse are not also all one song is to differentiate and divide them, no?
[12:30:37] <inhahe_> anomal: don't you and i see pretty much the same reality? i mean besides us being in two separate geographical places. we see the same world. why is that?
[12:30:39] <anomal> My point is the term ww3 doesn't make sense past rebirth
[12:30:41] <mrig> what I see now is the reflection of light upon my mind.
[12:30:46] <anomal> Concepts won't survive that process
[12:30:56] <anomal> You will reconceptualize your new reality after
[12:31:13] <mrig> so why are so many born with an innate fear of certain deadly animals then?
[12:31:34] <anomal> mrig: why wouldn't they be
[12:31:39] <mrig> phobias and the likes, if they are of dangerous things, they are not irrational at all.
[12:31:45] <anomal> I didn't say they are
[12:32:06] <mrig> well these are concepts, you said that they don't survive rebirth.
[12:32:17] <anomal> They're not concepts.
[12:32:45] <anomal> This is just your genetic code evolved to your environment.
[12:32:55] <anomal> But what your environment is, you interpret through concepts
[12:33:19] <anomal> Maybe the fear of deadly animals won't go away next time. But it won't be fear, not of deadly, not of animals.
[12:33:21] <mrig> but that is just the entropy inside of you making divisions.
[12:33:36] <anomal> You unweave all those concepts into little oscillating strings
[12:33:41] <anomal> Little elementary states

[12:47:06] <anomal> mrig: let me use an analogy.
[12:47:34] <anomal> mrig: can you imagine sometimes your life, its ups and downs, described as animation full of metaphors, that illustrate your life's challenges.
[12:47:42] <mrig> reality is very real, and it is apparent too. No need for abstract physical divisions to describe it, only the realisation that these divisions are being created by entropy within you.
[12:47:58] <anomal> mrig: can you do
[12:48:30] <anomal> mrig: you know how in art we keep telling the same story over and over, different actors, settings, planets
[12:48:58] <mrig> I use mathmatics to examine this, and have had flights into other modes of conciousness that this explains. So sort of.

[12:52:48] <anomal> Does depression mean anything when you leave that brain behind
[12:52:58] <mrig> what causes the birth and death of the ego?
[12:53:28] <anomal> mrig: I have not been told successfully what the 'ego' is

[13:00:20] <anomal> mrig: do you program
[13:00:39] <mrig> yes I do, still learning to program.
[13:01:30] <anomal> mrig: say in Java or JS, you compare two things, ==, they're equal. We know they're the same, but do we know what they are? What if we replace all names with a random number. What if we do this with the APIs too.
[13:01:39] <mrig> And yourself, do you program?
[13:01:44] <anomal> mrig: so now you can tell % and & are two things that are the same.
[13:01:49] <anomal> But you don't know what they are.
[13:01:52] <mrig> JS it is ===
[13:02:05] <anomal> Well it's identity.
[13:02:08] <mrig> == is an absurdity.
[13:02:12] <mrig> in JS :D
[13:02:13] <anomal> Doesn't matter, point is the same
[13:02:31] <mrig> so you are interested in category theory?
[13:02:35] <anomal> You see two gibberish things, know they're the same, or not the same, but you don't know what they are
[13:02:47] <mrig> nice, it is a great subject.
[13:02:59] <mrig> can I do math with them?
[13:03:02] <anomal> So I can go in and assign one set of names
[13:03:09] <anomal> to make sense of these things
[13:03:16] <anomal> You can go in and assign other names
[13:03:23] <anomal> And imagine them very differently.
[13:03:36] <anomal> Yet we both understand it and make predictions how the code behaves
[13:03:46] <anomal> We're wrong sometimes, right sometimes, sometimes about different things.
[13:03:51] <anomal> But we have some idea.
[13:03:57] <anomal> But our ideas are completely different.
[13:04:00] <anomal> COMPLETELY.
[13:04:11] <anomal> And that's, I think, reality
[13:04:18] <mrig> I think they are always subject to harmonics.
[13:04:19] <anomal> Code with no names.
[13:04:40] <anomal> There is oscillation, vibration, harmonics, looping.
[13:04:42] <anomal> There is yes
[13:04:54] <mrig> so in that way they have a fundamental similarity, and consequently a relationship with each other.
[13:04:58] <anomal> But maybe that's just another thing we put == on, and it's not
[13:05:18] <mrig> well this for me is a part of that model that I have preciously mentioned.
[13:06:10] <anomal> We get comfortable in life and we decide, we have a good grasp on things
[13:06:22] <anomal> It's an illusion

[13:07:20] <mrig> not going to argue with or about your capacity to effect the universe, I do not know you well enough :)
[13:07:31] <anomal> I wouldn't be surpised at all
[13:07:39] <anomal> Or we're at war with plants.
[13:07:46] <anomal> Which are then sentient species
[13:08:15] <anomal> Or maybe we're not reborn as meat
[13:08:19] <anomal> We're reborn as ideas.

[13:08:58] <anomal> And I may also be born as a meme.
[13:09:07] <anomal> And we'll be fighting in a world that feel extremely real to us
[13:09:14] <mrig> Though I pity the poor city folk who may never know this pleasure.
[13:09:16] <anomal> And to humans is just an online forum

[13:10:35] <anomal> See ya
[13:10:53] <mrig> on there is no crazy, only sanitary.
[13:11:11] <mrig> s/on/oh/
[13:11:11] <ro-bot-o> mrig meant to say: oh there is no crazy, only sanitary.
[13:13:12] <amigojapan> I don't see a problem with our being a single being made of many cooperating organisms. That does not seem new anomal
[13:21:04] <anomal> amigojapan: it doesn't seem new, but the point is how you think about iut
[13:21:23] <anomal> amigojapan: it seems like our cells are connected aren't they
[13:21:34] <anomal> amigojapan: what if they aren't, seen from another perspectivel
[13:21:43] <anomal> amigojapan: while ants and bees are connected
[13:21:45] <inhahe_> anomal said a couple of things that I've long suspected but have never heard anyone else say
[13:22:08] <anomal> inhahe_: what would be those
[13:22:33] <amigojapan> anomal: I am not a biologist, but I am sure they communicate in some way, so do ants
[13:22:39] <anomal> amigojapan: sure
[13:23:30] <inhahe_> anomal: that there may be an unlimited number of different ways of experiencing the same reality/world. there could be lifeforms among us we have no idea about. and the other thing is that maybe i'm the only one who actually exists in my world. i interface with other people through a language, but they really exist in totally different frames of perception
[13:24:17] <anomal> inhahe_: nice, I'm happy we see it the same way. OR ARE WE? ;-)
[13:25:43] <anomal> inhahe_: sometimes I see glimpses of alternate perception. They seem just as valid, in fact I can make useful predictions through them.
[13:25:55] <anomal> inhahe_: it's a slight hint of what maybe is the nature of reality
[13:26:00] <inhahe_> anomal: can you give an example?
[13:26:12] <amigojapan> inhahe_: solipsism is pretty lonely
[13:26:19] <anomal> amigojapan: it's not solipsism
[13:27:44] <anomal> inhahe_: I'm buying an apartment and I was working on the floor plan for the rooms. I had a dream how the whole building is like a living organism, with every part of it mapped to organs an animal would have. Every single choice made biological sense. Then when I woke up I had a much more clear idea what I want done, and why.
[13:28:16] <anomal> inhahe_: it's actually more involved, but it's hard to explain
[13:28:44] <inhahe_> cool
[13:29:10] <inhahe_> maybe that's where feng shui comes from ;)
[13:29:40] <anomal> inhahe_: there's an underlying pattern behind all reality that we don't see. We see fragments of it, under hundreds of different names
[13:30:06] <anomal> inhahe__: I feel to see the pattern entirely might mean we cease to be what we are basically.

[13:30:53] <inhahe_> yeah, i speculate that how we see reality follows directly from our own design
[13:31:25] <inhahe_> no subjectivity, no design
[13:32:41] <mrig> anomal: all just harmonics, see vastu too, sound or acoustics applied to architecture, reflecting the cosmos.
[13:32:42] <inhahe_> no personal frame of reference, no identity
[13:33:30] <anomal> inhahe_: that's the tricky part. We need to be biased in order to see anything at all. The only way to be objective, is basically to not be a human.

[13:34:33] <inhahe_> omni
[13:34:44] <amigojapan> anomal: you may make an argument that even we are parts of larger organizations of beings
[13:35:04] <anomal> inhahe_: in my dream I also felt that the design choices we make are actually literally "recycled" in other realities.
[13:36:00] <anomal> inhahe_: so say if I have two balconies looking in the same direction that's like binocular vision and what not. The size of the living room to the size of the dining room is like ratio between head and stomach and so on. It was weird. But also kinda made sense too
[13:36:26] <inhahe_> cool
[13:36:57] <inhahe_> maybe you'll be your apartment in your next life ;)
[13:37:08] <anomal> Thanks, for the nightmares

[13:42:50] <anomal> inhahe_: I have more examples, but I now realize I'm having a hard time putting them into words. I'd need to think about it
[13:43:39] <inhahe_> anomal: i'm not sure i can remember. one thing though is how already we know there's a large degree to which our biology determines how we see reality. taste, touch, smell, sight, hearing.. it's all more or less arbitrary. i just extrapolated from there.

[13:45:18] <inhahe_> not sure how i came to the thought about everyone in my reality possibly living in completely different reference frames
[13:45:29] <anomal> inhahe_: a lot of debates about why is space three dimensional. Why not 4 etc. Most likely, we perceive it that way, it's full of things around us we don't perceive
[13:45:31] <inhahe_> i guess i just thought of it because it's possible, in that i can't disprove it
[13:45:49] <anomal> inhahe_: indeed
[13:46:40] <anomal> inhahe_: that's the odd part. You can't disprove it, and... if you get a certain intuition about it, you realize how reality can decompose and recompose into something else, while every separate aspect remains as is.
[13:47:05] <anomal> This is why it's not solipsism.
[13:47:12] <anomal> It's not about "I only exist"
[13:47:38] <anomal> It's rather "only I see this world, everyone else with me in this world, sees a different world"

[13:55:03] <mrig> my take rather.
[13:58:42] <anomal> inhahe_: I'll check it out
[13:59:47] <anomal> inhahe_: here's another example. I read an article some years ago how it's useful to ascribe agency to things we want to have more or less in life. Say you watch too much TV, imagine the TV has agency and is trying to take your time, and counteract that (because our brain has evolved for fighting tangible enemies)

[14:01:45] <inhahe_> what does the selfish gene book say that corroborates that idea?
