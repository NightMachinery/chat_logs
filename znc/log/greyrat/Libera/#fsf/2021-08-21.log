[04:07:15] <la_mettrie> edit the work a bit and you can change the license

[04:08:57] <tpefreedom> I originally thought LGPL meant that a piece of code would always be under that license but that license like the expat/x11/original bsd/modified bsd/etc let you do that.
[04:09:03] <Noisytoot> you can't change the license. the original license still applies to the original work, but you can license your changes under any license
[04:09:15] <tpefreedom> Ok
[04:09:25] <tpefreedom> but weak copyleft protects the whole file
[04:09:30] <tpefreedom> not just specific code
[04:09:50] <Noisytoot> tpefreedom, you can't combine an LGPL work with a proprietary work (make proprietary changes), but you can combine a permissively licensed work with a proprietary work
[04:10:10] <Noisytoot> LGPL protects the entire work, not just the file
[04:10:45] <tpefreedom> So basically the stuff the gpl does but you can still link with anything
[04:11:28] <Noisytoot> only dynamically link, not statically link
[04:11:35] <tpefreedom> that's kinda confusing. How does it protect the whole work if you can just link it with a proprietary file one step later (in compilation)?
[04:11:41] <Noisytoot> you still have to allow the user to replace the dynamic library (LGPL part)
[04:12:16] <Noisytoot> tpefreedom, you can link it with a proprietary work as long as you allow the user their rights on the LGPL library (so you have to dynamically link)

[04:14:18] <tpefreedom> whereas with gpl you can't even dynamically link ig. But proprietary OSes like solaris have found ways to package GPL'd software like GNOME in their installation images.
[04:14:42] <Noisytoot> I think you can link GPL licensed software with system libraries or something like that
[04:15:00] <Noisytoot> "
[04:15:00] <Noisytoot> The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this c
[04:15:00] <Noisytoot> ontext, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it."
[04:15:22] <Noisytoot> "The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of 
[04:15:22] <Noisytoot> the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work."
[04:15:47] <Noisytoot> and "A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work"

[06:40:01] <clever> DiffieHellman: there is a uint32_t[4096] within MMIO space, that holds the sprite list, this function fills 7 slots in that list, describing a single sprite
[06:40:34] <clever> DiffieHellman: you just populate that array with as many sprites as you want, a termination marker (line 156), and then tell the hardware what index your list begins at
[06:41:05] <DiffieHellman> So it's not excessively hard to just get a getty based terminal working?
[06:41:06] <clever> DiffieHellman: the hw will then automatically fetch image data from ram, convert between pixel formats, alpha blend, and scale, and then spit it out a video port

[06:42:01] <clever> the ntsc generator needs exactly 108mhz as an input clock
[06:42:03] <clever> if you give it 108.1mhz, then you loose all color

[06:43:14] <hoppity> that's why they did it silently
[06:43:14] <lightbringer> they hid it somewhere in a post-install script or something like that
[06:43:35] <clever> lightbringer: i have been using https://github.com/littlekernel/lk as the core of my new replacement firmware
[06:43:39] <lightbringer> instead of adding a sources.list.d file properly, preferably in a package you can install if you want that repo
[06:43:55] <lightbringer> clever: oh, there's a replacement to ThreadX on the raspberry pi?
[06:44:17] <clever> lightbringer: using this repo: https://github.com/librerpi/lk-overlay
[06:44:29] <lightbringer> neat
[06:44:31] <clever> you can compile LK into one of 4 formats, bootcode.bin, start.elf, recovery.bin, and start4.elf
[06:44:50] <clever> bootcode.bin and recovery.bin get executed directly by the maskrom, so you control every byte that is controllable
[06:45:08] <clever> start.elf and start4.elf need to be loaded by a previous stage, after dram is brought online
[06:45:31] <clever> LK can create a bootcode.bin bootloader, that brings dram online, and loads a start.elf file, for anything in the pi0-pi3 range
[06:45:43] <clever> but i lack drivers for the bcm2711 dram controller
[06:45:51] <clever> if you use recovery.bin, you never get ram
[06:46:03] <clever> if you use start4.elf, you rely on the closed-source bootloader (held in spi flash)
[06:47:04] <lightbringer> :(
[06:47:08] <clever> lightbringer: with the fully open LK based bootcode.bin + start.elf chain, you can also execute a linux build, but that currently crashes due to unknown bugs
[06:47:35] <clever> with the rpi-open-firmware based bootcode.bin (it skips the .elf entirely), you can execute linux, and get nixos running fully, systemd, sshd
[06:47:52] <clever> on pi2 or pi3
[06:48:01] <clever> armv6 has bugs i havent solved yet
[06:48:16] <lightbringer> what's the catch with the rpi-open-firmware based bootcode.bin, other than it not working on rpi4?
[06:48:35] <clever> that codebase lacks threading, and the irq handling is primitive
[06:48:47] <clever> and its limited to 128kb for the entire binary
[06:48:55] <clever> so its difficult to extend its features
[06:48:55] <lightbringer> ic
[06:49:02] <clever> and it lacks video output entirely
[06:49:06] <lightbringer> ouch
[06:49:20] *** Joins: joo (~joo@fsf/member/joo--)
[06:49:36] <clever> LK is a pre-existing kernel, with full threading and irq support, and i ported it to the VPU
[06:49:51] <clever> that then acts as a great base to build upon, as i write drivers for different things
[06:50:15] <clever> for example, an LK based bootcode.bin, can load start.elf from ext2/3/4
[06:50:19] <clever> https://github.com/littlekernel/lk/pull/303/files
[06:50:25] <clever> i added support for ext4 this week
[06:50:45] <clever> so the fat32 partition can just be a bootcode.bin and nothign else
[06:51:18] <DiffieHellman> FAT32 eh? I would love to get a computer that doesn't use FAT32 at all.
[06:51:40] <clever> DiffieHellman: the boot rom on the vc4 line of soc's can load bootcode.bin from spi flash as well, but ive not tested it yet
[06:51:48] <clever> that would let you skip fat32 entirely
[06:51:49] <DiffieHellman> Nice.
[06:52:01] <clever> the bootrom can even go into i2c-slave mode
[06:52:06] <clever> and accept the entire bootcode.bin as a series of i2c writes
[06:52:42] <clever> DiffieHellman: ive dumped the bootrom for most of my pi models, and decompiled the crap out of them all

[06:59:47] <DiffieHellman> Very nice. All I have is a Zero WH (Pi's are extra expensive here for no reason, even the Zero was expensive), but I guess I'll test the free firmware...eventually
[07:00:16] *** Joins: dot0 (~dot0@user/dot0)
[07:01:19] <clever> DiffieHellman: i did also play with usb gadget mode on the zero, but then discovered the docs i have are of questionable legality, so ive just put that code on ice till i can get a better answer
[07:03:04] <clever> DiffieHellman: it has been mentioned elsewhere, that the EZR32WG from silicon labs, has great documentation, and "the same dwc usb controller as the rpi"

[07:22:41] <dragestil> This copilot white paper is hard. It requires knowledge in both software copyright law and deep learning
[07:23:39] <clever> dragestil: i think i saw an example of it copy/pasting from one library, and then slapping a different entirely incompatible license at the top of the file
[07:24:14] <dragestil> Yeah but the github people argue that's edge case
[07:24:17] <clever> dragestil: https://hoogleplus.goto.ucsd.edu/ seems like a far better idea then copilot
[07:24:40] <clever> it will basically brute-force assemble functions, and then run them thru a testcase, to see if it does what you wanted
[07:25:03] <clever> its not copying if you just assembled the functions by brute force search!
[07:25:35] <dragestil> And to understand the situation to write  the white paper you'll  also probably need to try out the copilot which requires  a github account and vscode 
[07:28:33] <dragestil> It's one of the situations where you have to use non free software to advance free software movement

[08:05:41] <DiffieHellman> In my option, the output of copoilot is under _all_ the licences as it pretty much has read a bunch of code with different licences and outputs a mashup of them all. Github better release their entire source under all the licences to comply.
[08:07:16] <clever> DiffieHellman: my thoughts, re-train copilot again, but create a seperate training set, for each license
[08:07:29] <clever> so you can set it to a GPL only mode, and it will emit code based only on GPL repos

[21:04:31] <kompowiec> I described the reaction of non-tech people on the matrix free software channel - good move, but I don't know if it will be effective. nd what are his successes? for the regular user what has changed?
[21:04:32] <kompowiec> Me: you have access to a myriad of good quality libre software that anyone can edit, such as Wikipedia
[21:04:36] <kompowiec> Non-tech: for an ordinary user like me - it adds nothing. this is fun for connoisseurs give an example of changes that will have a practical benefit

[21:11:03] <kompowiec> one of the suggestions - "The main business argument is always increasing profits. Given the subscription business model that has become so commonplace with proprietary software, your employer is (likely) wasting money until switching his company to free software."
[21:11:22] <kompowiec> in other words, TCO
[21:12:12] <joepublic> if "money" is the most important driver, what place freedom?
[21:13:08] <kompowiec> maybe need to differently, indicate vendor lock in as a threat.
[21:13:58] <kreyren[m]> On the subject i usually propose a gradual switch on free software e.g. it didn't made economically sense to switch on fully free software model so i like to make slowly things free software that are not essential to the economics and then calculate what would be the impact of switching on free software
[21:13:58] <kreyren[m]> e.g. in gitpod i've converted components on free software and calculated that for them to go free software they need at least 150 paying users so i hooked em up with amazon and they are now fully free software
[21:14:55] <kreyren[m]> the issue that i see in FLOSS advocates with this is that you are making free software that will be part of proprietary until it is released so to most people it feels wrong to make more proprietary.. i wish ppl understood this more and did similar activism

[21:16:27] <kompowiec> but ultimately, the question of this particular non-tech guy is crucial - they don't know how libre software affects their lives
[21:16:55] <kreyren[m]> so help me educate them by providing me resources for volteurope to spread :p

[21:24:49] <kompowiec> the interesting thing is that much of the mainstream media has turned into libertarian narratives after 2020. What would have to happen the same for libre software...
[21:26:00] <kompowiec> finally, In most cases I'd expect bringing up idealist - or even technical - arguments to be a waste of time
[21:27:27] <joepublic> they are only a "waste of time" if "immediate conversion" is the measure of success.  Such information when shared increases mindshare, however much or little.
