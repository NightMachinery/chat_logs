[00:09:37] <mknod> useretailz, cut (or copy) and paste in your existing script.
[00:09:52] <Soliton> why do you think it should work?
[00:10:47] <useretailz> because the my function is available from any terminal, but the script doesn't see it
[00:10:51] <neshpion> useretailz: scripts run in non-interactive shells, which doesn't source .bashrc because that is for interactive shells
[00:11:11] <mknod> And most importantly, then run in a *different* shell.

[00:12:56] <useretailz> Soliton, ok, i got it now. but the logic seems to be a bit strange cause bash understands where to look for executables and execute them, why not use the same logic for scripts

[00:22:53] <twkm> just invoke them the same way you would a function useretailz.
[00:22:55] <tirnanog> useretailz: eh? no. you source code where you need the code to be evaluated in the current shell.
[00:23:13] <tirnanog> the point is that you can create a file that contains a common set of library functions. why does it have to be .bashrc?
[00:23:21] <texasmynsted> I would rather "read" the files than source them. It is too easy to have executable bash get "sourced". I know I am being hypocritical here, trading bash for lua.

[00:27:00] <useretailz> neshpion, i have them in a folder too, but the question is how to use them in every script
[00:27:12] <useretailz> once a function is defined in .bashrc it's loaded automatically and can be used in any interactive session. since i run all scripts from interactive sessions, i want to have access to my function that is defined in .bashrc
[00:27:23] <texasmynsted> if you want these scripts available to your environment, why not convert them to functions and load one file?
[00:27:27] <neshpion> useretailz: add that directory to PATH in ~/.profile, then logout and relogin and it should be available to every script you write
[00:28:04] <Soliton> indeed if those scripts are only for interactive shells you might as well make them functions, too.
[00:28:20] <neshpion> useretailz: scripts don't automatically have access to *anything* in .bashrc because .bashrc is not sourced by non-interactive shells, and scripts run in non-interactive shells

[01:07:29] <mknod> themachine, that's the main difference from a practical perspective.
[01:07:30] <themachine> or does the herestring just use the same kernel filesystem that a pipe does

[02:06:02] <ormaaj> seems like a bash bug though. Once the stdin is closed and replaced by fd 3 bash should not blindly close it
[02:06:02] <ffguest> shbot, ormaaj: meow
[02:06:23] <cryptonector> the Linux /dev/fd/N being a symlink, and not being magical, is a horrible hack that saves the Linux kernel needing the hack that /dev/fd/N magic ends up requiring, but the magic thing is better
[02:07:36] <cryptonector> ormaaj: it's not a bug -- it's documented
[02:07:56] <ormaaj> Nope, it is magical in bash. /dev/fd redirects are handled internally by the shell specially
[02:08:05] <cryptonector> [n]<&digit-   ->   moves the file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if n is not specified.  digit is closed after  being duplicated to n.

[02:11:50] <tirnanog> doesn't that depend on how bash was built, though? I think there's a test case for whether the platform supports it.
[02:11:56] <tirnanog> at build time.
[02:12:27] <cryptonector> I wish Linux had gotten this right...
[02:12:48] <emanuele6> yes, it decides at build time whether to emulate /dev/fd/N or to use the system's /dev/fd/N
[02:12:53] <tirnanog> HAVE_DEV_FD, DEV_FD_PREFIX and such.
[02:13:44] <emanuele6> same for /dev/tcp/ /dev/udp/ /dev/stdin /dev/stdout /dev/stderr
[02:13:49] <tirnanog> as such, I wouldn't expect it to be handled specially in linux, though I didn't check.

You have to infer that from the manual where bash lists the /dev/fd redirects as special and also handles them with builtins and [[ ]]. Yeah I think it may be somewhat dependent on platform / compile time options too IIRC.

[06:55:42] <Blondie101010> you could just pass the timestamp on the command line
[06:56:12] <Blondie101010> well if it's to update time, you just need a scheduler

[07:56:52] <neshpion> i have a string "09" and i want to put this into a parameter with the INTEGER attribute set.  i haven't managed to do so because bash *always* interprest the string "09" to be an octal digit (because of leading 0) and errors, saying "value too great for base (error token is "09")"
[07:56:58] <janko> so if I had experience I could go "well i cn try option A B or C"

[09:01:13] <janko> how can a script export and import variables?
[09:02:57] <Blondie101010> from where?
[09:03:08] <Blondie101010> my example used a file to store a single field
[09:03:10] *** Joins: libc (~weechat@user/tessio)
[09:05:54] <janko> is that because bash is not good with data structures? (regarding the field per file)
[09:08:02] <Blondie101010> it was a very simple example of how to do a timer
[09:08:24] <Blondie101010> scripting and programming is as flexible as the develop who uses it
[09:08:26] <neshpion> you can export variables to child processes only, using the `export` command.  subshells that run scripts inherit their parent process's environment, and can `source` additional files to acquire those varialbes and functions
[09:09:07] <Blondie101010> now he's talking of more complex data structures
[09:09:21] <Blondie101010> soon, he'll need to represent the whole DNA sequence
[09:09:51] <neshpion> janko: i don't know what you mean by "field per file".  as for datastructures, bash has strings, arrays, and associative arrays, and that's about it
[09:10:12] <Blondie101010> he wants to save data in files
[09:10:24] <neshpion> >
[09:10:25] <neshpion> :D
[09:10:26] <Blondie101010> there is no single perfect solution
[09:10:42] <Blondie101010> you, the programmer, decide how you'll store it
[09:10:51] * neshpion stores Blondie101010
[09:11:28] <Blondie101010> plain csv is easy to use in bash, but you could also use shell environment sourcing and echo
[09:13:32] <janko> humm is there any guideline?
[09:13:42] <Blondie101010> could also be IFS delimited when the parameters are fixed
[09:14:31] <Blondie101010> what is the current problem/question?
[09:14:42] <janko> I want my timer to have a pause function.
[09:14:57] <janko> to do that I need to save certain vars
[09:15:02] <Blondie101010> yeah that complicates it
[09:15:07] <janko> such as pause length etc
[09:15:18] <janko> was thinking of saving them onto a file
[09:15:30] <Blondie101010> no, you store the fake beginning
[09:16:07] <Blondie101010> but you do need more than one variable
[09:16:23] <janko> yeah
[09:16:34] <Blondie101010> adding $status could do
[09:17:32] <janko> i was thinking of 4: isrunning, block_start, ispaused, pause_start,
[09:18:01] <Blondie101010> seems unneeded
[09:18:17] <Blondie101010> just need to know if it's running or paused
[09:18:26] <janko> oh total_pause_length
[09:18:36] <Blondie101010> when you unpause, adjust the beginngin timestamp
[09:18:42] <Blondie101010> grade 7 Math
[09:19:00] <Blondie101010> no need to keep track of pause duration

[09:24:19] <Blondie101010> for simple things, you could use sed to update your variables, like: sed "s/begin=.*\$/begin=$begin/" /path/to/file # once they're initially set up
[09:24:38] <janko> pause_length is for the cummulative pause, since you might pause more than once..
[09:25:15] <Blondie101010> it will be harder to keep track of, but can work
[09:25:37] *** Quits: Thanatermesis (~Thanaterm@191.92.148.122) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[09:26:02] <Blondie101010> I'd see it using $begin, $pauseStart, and $status
[09:26:39] <Blondie101010> so when you pause, you store the pauseStart, and when you unpause, you update the status, and begin (pauseStart being irrelevant)
[09:27:23] <Blondie101010> that should take less than 10 minutes to do with what I gave you so far

[09:35:57] <janko> or alternatively keeping a timer with a pause fucntion without saving variables
[09:36:24] <Blondie101010> state has to be preserved somewhere
[09:37:02] <Blondie101010> if it's not stored outside the program/script, then that process needs to persist

[20:17:06] <beuys> Say you do "wget something &" 10 times in a loop. Is there a way to wait until all wgets have finished?
[20:18:49] <ormaaj> yes!
[20:19:25] <ormaaj> in fact that's what wait does by default
[20:20:37] <beuys> ormaaj: Oh, nice! Thanks and happy Xmas!
[20:20:45] <beuys> How do I surpress all output of a command?
[20:20:54] <ormaaj> 😁
[20:21:17] <koollman> command >/dev/null 2>&1
[20:21:26] <beuys> koollman: Oh, nice! Thanks!
[20:21:33] <koollman> although I'm sure wget has an option like --quiet or --silent, too
[20:21:45] <koollman> right. --quiet
[20:22:04] <beuys> Even better!
[20:22:13] <beuys> Ok, thanks guys! I gotta go!

[23:46:03] <DPA> I have a container and build stuff in it. It seams something notices it's backgrounded and decides to sigstop. Now, is there some way to allocate a fake tty, so it doesn't matter if I background it?
[23:46:03] <DPA> I should probably also redirect stdin from /dev/null. How will that interact with the controling terminals and process groups? I think I do still need the former thing, since /dev/tty doesn't depend just on stdin, right?
[23:48:19] <llua> using tmux, screen, etc
[23:49:29] <DPA> That seams pretty heavy just for this.
[23:49:46] <llua> they create pts, which are literal fake ttys
[23:49:59] <llua> the exact thing that you just asked for
[23:50:22] <greycat> You could also figure out what "thing" is trying to read from a terminal, and stop it from doing that.
[23:50:41] <greycat> maybe some option like --force or -y
[23:51:32] <twkm> perhaps stty -tostop.
[23:51:51] <twkm> i tend to prefer screen.
[23:52:36] <llua> but does it create fake-fake tty
[23:52:50] <DPA> Yes, but they are also whole terminal emulators. THinking about this, I may not even need to set the controlling terminal to an actual terminal, I think it can be any file. So maybe I can do something with setsid & a pipe.
[23:53:25] <llua> lost in the sauce
[23:53:52] <xx> what are fake ttys?
[23:54:18] <llua> a fake terminal
[23:55:25] <llua> emulators of terminals kinda fit the bill
[23:55:46] <llua> !b18
[23:55:46] <greybot> The newbie will not accept the answer you give, no matter how right it is.
[23:55:48] <llua> but that

[23:56:26] <xx> by that logic, aren't all ttys fake these days? Nobody is using actual terminals anymore, hopefully.
[23:57:23] <DPA> xx: There are pseudo terminal master (ptm) and terminal slave (pts) devices. Nowadays, you get a new terminal master device fd if you open /dev/ptmx, and it creates a device pts in /dev/pts/X. The ptm is for the terminal emulator, the pts for the terminal slave. It's a bit like a bidirectional pipe, but does some input processing & signaling & other generic tty stuff.
[23:58:02] <DPA> There are also some magic functions that must be called after creating that stuff, fore some reason.
[23:58:15] <xx> that actually finally makes some sense regarding some other questions I used to have
[23:58:23] <greycat> You said you're "building" stuff.  That's heavy as hell.  Adding screen or tmux is nothin'.
[23:59:02] <DPA> Look, I use containers, but I don't even require having a container engine installed.
