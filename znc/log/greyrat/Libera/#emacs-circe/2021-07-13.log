[10:56:28] <wasamasa> I wasn't aware there's already an emacs-circe project
[10:56:41] <wasamasa> so circe could indeed be moved there
[11:03:57] <wasamasa> it has been moved
[11:04:25] *** ChanServ sets mode: +o wasamasa
[11:04:27] *** wasamasa changes topic to 'Circe, a Client for IRC in Emacs. | The only true IRC editor. | https://github.com/emacs-circe/circe'
[11:04:30] *** ChanServ sets mode: -o wasamasa
[19:35:53] <crowbar> trying out circe.  tracking mode is showing activity in my modeline as expected, but i'm seeing #emacs listed as #e@    while other channels appear with just their names.  Any reason for it?
[19:37:23] <wasamasa> you're in some other emacs channel
[19:37:28] <wasamasa> like #emacs-circe :D
[19:37:44] <wasamasa> and the common string is #emacs
[19:39:35] <crowbar> makes sense.  thanks.

[20:53:15] <crowbar> Any method for keeping circe-display-images disabled, but allow manually toggling of an image from a url at point? M-x circe-display-images-toggle-image-at-point seems to require enable-circe-display-images by set.
[21:05:11] <wasamasa> I suspect that would need some hacking on that module
[21:06:05] <wasamasa> on an unrelated note, I've made github actions "work"
[21:06:16] <wasamasa> got five emails for failed runs, yay
[21:43:55] <wasamasa> tests work now
