[17:52:48] <PapuaHardyNet> I've been taking fluvoxamine for the past two days as an attempt to prevent the worst long COVID outcomes for myself
[17:52:59] *** Quits: feep[work] (~mathis@195.50.168.194) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[17:54:16] <PapuaHardyNet> most notable sides: (1) zero sexual desire, zero desire to watch porn or hentai of any kind. this thing is a chemical castrator
[17:54:50] <kiboneu> sounds like me in the winters absent drugs
[17:55:48] <PapuaHardyNet> kiboneu, you mean SAD?
[17:56:34] <kiboneu> maybe
[17:57:08] <kiboneu> my ocd spikes in the winters
[17:57:27] <kiboneu> and i get really angry about everything
[17:57:29] <kiboneu> and i get dumber
[17:57:42] <PapuaHardyNet> literally transforming into hulk
[17:58:14] <PapuaHardyNet> but yeah, anger and depressive episodes doesn't really happen together
[17:58:48] <PapuaHardyNet> have you tried SSRIs yet? they help with OCD too as far as I've heard
[17:59:28] <PapuaHardyNet> which actually leads me to the second notable downside of taking fluvoxamine, an SSRI: multi-hour reddit scrolling sessions
[18:00:12] <kiboneu> it used to be different / lack-of-energy. i was taking NAC+ for a month which seemingly helped others with symptoms, but for me -- i don't know if the ocd really diminishes during the day but it'd spike HEAVY during the nights, likely indicating that I should seek a slow release variant
[18:00:45] <PapuaHardyNet> really interesting
[18:01:04] <kiboneu> (then vitamin d and b, i decided to up those every winter (last winter seemed to work ok))
[18:01:20] <kiboneu> (plus a bright 10k lumen light in the morns)
[18:01:25] <PapuaHardyNet> your ocd probably has very little effect in your life I guess? that's great to hear tbh
[18:01:41] <kiboneu> haha
[18:01:56] <PapuaHardyNet> (well okay, we can make mistakes in the evenings that haunt us for much longer. my bad)
[18:02:24] <PapuaHardyNet> vitamin d and b aren't working this winter?
[18:02:30] <kiboneu> they are
[18:02:40] <kiboneu> this winter is better than other winters imo
[18:03:05] <kiboneu> just a different fingerprint of energy flows in the psyche
[18:03:44] <kiboneu> ok i really should get back to reading this paper before syncing up with $coworker today -- ttyl PapuaHardyNet 
[18:03:57] <PapuaHardyNet> bye!
[18:20:04] <catern> designing the emacs tutorial for all the new hires at my new job, I think I'll start by reading the entirety of https://www.gwern.net/Choosing-Software aloud, twice
[18:20:04] <Robomot> Choosing Software · Gwern.net (Criteria making software useful long-term & worth learning in detail)
[18:21:54] <PapuaHardyNet> are you going to recommend them a framework like spacemacs or doomemacs
[18:22:02] <catern> absolutely fucking not
[18:22:24] <catern> someone has introduced spacemacs today and my first order of business will be ripping that shit out
[18:22:36] <PapuaHardyNet> have you tried doom emacs
[18:22:47] <catern> no
[18:22:55] <PapuaHardyNet> please do, it has amazing UX
[18:23:44] <catern> sigh, I suppose I should, so that I can say "it's bad, I tried it" rather than "it's bad, I know this because I derived it through pure reason"
[18:23:56] <PapuaHardyNet> that works :)
[18:25:26] <catern> the only good emacs framework is https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit
[18:25:27] <Robomot> GitHub - technomancy/emacs-starter-kit: Because the Emacs defaults are not so great sometimes.
[18:27:58] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I've moved on from emacs so I have very little stake in this game
[18:28:10] <PapuaHardyNet> I do want to point out a few great things about doom emacs to you though
[18:29:09] <PapuaHardyNet> 1. modules. doom's modules are amazing. comment out a module name and you disable an entire collection of emacs packages that are built in a way that are tightly integrated with each other to reinforce the doom experience
[18:29:20] <PapuaHardyNet> uncomment it and you enable it
[18:30:20] <catern> yes that's called require, C-h f require
[18:30:25] <PapuaHardyNet> 2. which-key. the discoverability of the emacs UI in the doom emacs framework is just incredible. I'm very sure that other bloated frameworks may replicate this, but doom was both non-bloated and had a UI that made it easy for a new user to use the text editor
[18:31:30] <catern> yes that's a standalone package, and also C-h k, C-h c, C-h l in regular emacs
[18:32:01] <PapuaHardyNet> you are demonstrating my point for me
[18:33:23] <PapuaHardyNet> doom massively reduces overwhelm for a new emacs user.
[18:33:30] <catern> C-h and the help system are talked about in the tutorial
[18:33:45] <catern> extensively
[18:34:58] <catern> but I didn't say which-key is not a good package
[18:35:05] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, you intend for them to get started on "as close to vanilla" as possible
[18:35:19] <catern> (also any prefix in Emacs can be followed by ? to list all the keybindings under the prefix, but I freely admit that that is not discoverable and not talked about in the tutorial)
[18:35:24] <PapuaHardyNet> very sensible choice, and I agree with that.
[18:39:37] <PapuaHardyNet> oh btw catern, i'm curious - is the use of emacs standard in your team or workplace?
[18:39:54] <PapuaHardyNet> s/standard/a standard/
[18:41:04] <catern> at $NEWJOB (which I don't yet work at) 80% of the company uses it and it's taught to new hires (it used to be 95-100% but their lack of SENSIBLE MAINTENANCE has resulted in new hires finding it hard to use)
[18:42:09] <PapuaHardyNet> but you aren't hired there yet
[18:42:15] <PapuaHardyNet> you aren't getting paid for this
[18:42:18] <catern> oh I have the offer
[18:42:31] <PapuaHardyNet> you still aren't getting paid for this
[18:42:45] <catern> well... yes... I would do it for free, but don't tell them that
[18:43:16] <PapuaHardyNet> hahahah, well, I'm glad you find such joy in mentoring new software developers
[18:45:35] <catern> i'm trying to ask the Doom Emacs Discord how I can install Doom without contaminating my existing Emacs installation
[18:45:45] <catern> this thing is so vastly overcomplicated and it uses other overcomplicated things
[18:46:16] <catern> why can't people just do http://catern.com/reuse.html instead of making endless piles of new abstractions and making the whole system overcomplicated ARGH
[18:46:16] <Robomot> If you want to solve a problem simply, reuse existing abstractions
[18:49:18] <catern> like https://github.com/vlaci/nix-doom-emacs
[18:49:19] <Robomot> GitHub - vlaci/nix-doom-emacs: doom-emacs packaged for Nix
[18:49:29] <catern> like, you have to be kidding me
[18:50:14] <catern> nix is an amazing system where you can distribute packages as a git repo and make them installable with a simple `nix-env --install --file https://path/to/whatever`
[18:50:28] <catern> and that's reusable within many different contexts
[18:50:49] <catern> this insane garbage repo has two ways to install it: 1. overcomplicated framework one, 2. overcomplicated framework two
[18:52:52] <catern> as I don't use either of those frameworks (I just use normal Nix, because it suffices for my needs), I can't use this package (at least not without hacking it open and hacking it into sanity)
[18:59:55] <Gurkenglas> "Terms-of-service Labeling, Design, and Readability Act" okay not bad
[19:00:28] <Gurkenglas> not that i read it
[19:08:23] <PapuaHardyNet> hey Gurkenglas
[19:08:48] <PapuaHardyNet> how have you been doing
[19:18:00] <catern> lol
[19:18:15] <catern> doom emacs breaks C-h k
[19:18:17] <catern> into the fire with it
[19:18:40] <catern> (specifically, C-h k by default gives you help about the keybinding you type after it)
[19:19:14] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[19:19:18] <catern> (doom emacs has rebound it to something which seems to look up the function that the key is bound to, and then show you the help for that function)
[19:21:27] <catern> on their docs: >Emacs is no journey of a mere thousand miles. You will run into problems and mysterious errors. 
[19:21:34] <catern> yes and you are the cause of those, doom emacs
[19:22:37] <catern> these emacs "frameworks" always remind me of when I was a teenager and obsessed with modding Oblivion
[19:22:50] <catern> and there were all kinds of insane errors and incompatibilities you'd see
[19:23:01] <PapuaHardyNet> rite of passage, eh? I had the same teenage, but with Skyrim
[19:23:17] <catern> and sometimes people would beneficently package together all their mods and conflict resolutions and all that
[19:23:26] <catern> so that you could "just" install that and everything would work
[19:23:54] <catern> the concept of those big balls of broken mud seems very similar to these emacs frameworks
[19:24:58] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: hah, funny to hear that, although I guess I shouldn't be surprised it's common. did you also spend more time finding and installing and tweaking mods than playing the game?
[19:25:04] <catern> (I for sure did)
[19:26:04] <PapuaHardyNet> that's right! I actually wrote a bit about it here: https://apotheosis.srht.site/version_control_for_game_modding.html
[19:26:04] <Robomot> Version control for video game modding - Apotheosis (Why and how)
[19:26:17] <pompolic> https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Foreplay+with+Todd
[19:26:18] <Robomot> Urban Dictionary: Foreplay with Todd (The act of spending hours modding The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim before playing the actual game.)
[19:27:19] <catern> haha, yes yes
[19:27:51] <pompolic> i learned this term the other day
[19:28:15] <pompolic> i don't remember if i ever got into modding something so much that i wished for version control
[19:28:52] <pompolic> maybe there's an under-exploited niche here, though: dependency resolution (with versioning) for mods
[19:29:28] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: i guess for you, modding Skyrim and knowing how to program were much closer in time (or, in fact, overlapped)
[19:29:40] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah
[19:29:58] <catern> at the time I was modding Oblivion I didn't know how to program, so your thoughts on this matter are much more sophisticated than mine
[19:30:19] <catern> but I *certainly* know the pain you're talking about, and thinking back, would have loved what I know now as version control
[19:30:58] <catern> although today I reject proprietary video games anyway, better to "mod" a free game
[19:31:17] <catern> which will certainly be using git anyway
[19:32:57] <catern> (sigh, doom emacs runs gcmh, that dumb cargo-culted thing that's supposed to improve gc performance.  again, very reminiscent of cargo-cult optimizations when modding)
[19:37:03] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm glad you liked what I wrote
[19:38:54] <catern> PapuaHardyNet: oh and yes borg seems reasonable
[19:39:20] <catern> what I'd really want to do is use Nix to build the mod directories
[19:39:31] <catern> then put the Nix expressions in git
[19:40:12] <catern> that resolves the "large binary files" issue in the same way Nix usually solves it: they're downloaded (or used from the cache) as part of the build
[19:40:28] <catern> alternatively, maybe btrfs snapshots would be good
[19:40:48] <catern> or even full-fledges ostree
[19:40:53] <catern> https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/
[19:40:53] <Robomot> libostree - ostreedev/ostree (ostree documentation)
[19:41:11] <catern> your skyrim mod directory is an OS which runs on the Skyrim.exe virtual machine
[19:42:18] <Gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, last few weeks I've been trying to refactor this characterization of relative entropy into nonsense abstract enough to swap out parts without the rest breaking, so that I might solve interpretability and utility aggregation.
[19:42:24] <catern> qemu-esp
[19:42:58] <pompolic> would the skyrim version of the inner platform effect be called "inner dungeon effect"
[19:43:52] <gwern> does skyrim not support platforming, with platforms you can jump across?
[19:44:05] <catern> I also often think of what would be created if all the effort lavished on Skyrim, a proprietary platform where you can't reuse/distribute/remix your work, had gone into a free game which was actually redistributable and usable for commercial purposes
[19:44:22] <catern> we'd have something great! (this is part of why I'm excited about OpenMW)
[19:44:35] <gwern> such a free game would never have come into existence
[19:44:38] <catern> gwern: it has minor platforming parts - giant blades to dodge, chasms to jump over
[19:45:12] <gwern> it would lack the basic implementation and coherent artistic and design vision that attracted all the modders. even something like minecraft requires large teams of dedicated maintainers
[19:45:18] <catern> gwern: it's happened before - even if only by a previously proprietary game becoming free - doom for example - it can happen again
[19:45:46] <gwern> but that's not creating a free game. that's giving away a proprietary game and relinquishing it
[19:45:53] <gwern> parasitism
[19:45:59] <pompolic> oh that reminds me, i've wanted to write a vr renderer for openmw
[19:46:06] <catern> the end result is the same, at least as much as I care

[23:00:43] <kiboneu> i have a hard time trusting people who aren't sketchy

[23:01:16] <kiboneu> really? oh
[23:01:53] <gwern> also shading heavily into eysenckian psychoticism. not inherently a bad thing - many of the best researchers are the same way
[23:02:01] <kiboneu> that seems dependent on how the rules interact with one's priority set
[23:02:16] <kiboneu> i.e. someone might find the rules anti-social
[23:02:37] * kiboneu looks up eysenckian psychoticism

[23:04:10] <kiboneu> popping drm doesn't seem to have such implications, though it's still against the rules

[23:08:19] <kiboneu> exploits are basically weapons and they can be used to fuck up someone's life... and there are plenty of go-with-the-groove self-professed whitehats who participate, without care, because it's open and legal

[23:08:55] <kiboneu> fair. spectrum it is

[23:10:21] <kiboneu> super mormon hackers and sketch af ones
[23:11:10] <gwern> this is the impression I get of things like the israeli hacking companies... there tends to be a much more bimodal extreme of the stonecold psychopath/autist types who'd sell their grandmother to MBS's bonesaw doctors, and the conformists and patriots who go 'it's for the motherland, and they're just arabs, not Jews'
[23:11:21] <kiboneu> so there's spectrum and dimension + perspective, i suppose dark triad traits are primitives in that system

[23:19:11] <ggreer> text the AG, then file a public records request for his texts. when he says "oh we don't have any for those dates you asked for", you know he's lying
[23:19:19] <kiboneu> a lot of arcade games aren't supported nor sold anymore
[23:19:28] <gwern> old arcade games compete with new
[23:19:41] <kiboneu> is that bad though?
[23:19:43] <gwern> money is fungible. the money being spent on the old games, as documented by that article, is not being spent on new
[23:19:49] <pompolic> real wassenaar hours
[23:20:10] <gwern> (even if this is not as extreme as say that streetfighter oral history I linked the other week where they were estimating that the blackmarket manufactured and sold something like 10x the number of real street fighter arcade cabinets that they made)
[23:20:28] <pompolic> i think what i dislike about exploits-as-weapons is that a weapon is a physical object while exploits are information, so distribution works differently
[23:20:29] <catern> gwern: is part of what you're saying just: if you aren't dark triad, you follow "the rules" automatically - so any violation of rules is dark triad
[23:20:36] <gwern> yes
[23:20:43] <pompolic> you probably can't have arms control for exploit without crazy tyranny
[23:21:36] <kiboneu> yeah i agree with this, the weapons part is really just addressing the impact / function dimension
[23:21:40] <pompolic> moreover: as i understand it, knowhow from "junk hacking" translates surprisingly well
[23:21:52] <gwern> anyway, I don't think it's that big a deal. my point is that because of the psychology of transgression, if you notice the pattern one place, you can more easily notice it the other.
[23:22:08] <gwern> if you are familiar with infosec trans, you can spot it elsewhere like hardware hacking
[23:22:23] * pompolic reads further back
[23:22:33] <rmmh> I just assume any woman in emulator dev is trans
[23:22:48] <gwern> if you haven't had any experience with infosec trans, you probably just skim over this gwen and go 'so sad, wonder if she died of covid' and forget it about it 5s later
[23:22:59] <gwern> meanwhile, if you have...
[23:23:30] <pompolic> hmm
[23:24:00] <pompolic> i often wonder if i go most of the way towards being "infosec trans", without actually being trans
[23:24:18] <gwern> I hate to break it to you, but we're almost all honorary catear-wearers here
[23:24:42] <pompolic> this is true. i understand
[23:24:45] <catern> nyan
[23:25:10] <catern> using irc is dark triad
[23:26:08] <pompolic> i think i would need to look into eysenckian psychoticism to make the point i want to make
[23:26:15] <kiboneu> yeah that was interesting. i guess i'm more psychopathic than i initially believed, but that changes nothing and is probably a good thing
[23:26:51] <pompolic> absent that, the connection i would draw is something like
[23:27:15] <catern> i'm reading through fablesofaesop.com now since gwern made that great allusion
[23:27:16] <kiboneu> i.e. by having a "little psychopath emulator" to help assess other people's psychopathic tendencies
[23:27:35] <catern> i should be more sophisticated and be able to reference fables
[23:28:10] <catern> this one's good https://fablesofaesop.com/the-goatherd-and-the-wild-goats.html
[23:28:11] <Robomot> The Goatherd and The Wild Goats - Fables of Aesop (A goatherd put his Goats with wild Goats and prized the wild and so fed them better than his hoping they would stay. They did not and his Goats suffered.)
[23:28:22] <pompolic> i'm fairly sure that there's something like: a personality trait that has to do with how well you get immersed into things
[23:28:54] <pompolic> this is extremely useful for hardware/low-level work because you can just shape rotate all day
[23:29:27] <pompolic> it also probably ends up with making/exploring/integrating virtual identities pretty quickly

[23:31:09] <pompolic> maybe also an insight into how exactly "we are all simulations" is true
[23:31:10] <kiboneu> gwern: i'm reminded of my first days in kindergarten literally going around knocking classmates' block towers down
[23:31:23] <gwern> as the twig is inclined...
[23:31:39] <kiboneu> and quickly learned that fun can't sustain itself
[23:31:46] <kiboneu> *that this sort of fun
[23:32:15] <gwern> that's why you do it online. there's a whole universe of bridges you can burn!
[23:32:28] <kiboneu> i don't really do it online though
[23:32:29] <gwern> just have to be careful to not push it quite so far that traditional constraints can catch up
[23:32:36] <kiboneu> yeah
[23:32:42] <gwern> even ggreer's nemesis has avoided actual prison
[23:33:11] <kiboneu> i think i'm more constructive than average nowadays
[23:33:24] <kiboneu> but sometimes in order to create you have to destroy something
[23:33:25] <gwern> on a side note, the association of psychopathy with urban environments has long been attributed to this. if you pull that stuff among, say, the eskimo, they quietly drown you one day out kayaking
[23:33:49] <pompolic> cities are dark triad?
[23:34:18] <gwern> well, psychopathy definitely. I would assume the other two as well but I don't know for sure. I never read up on them as much as I have psychopathy
[23:34:19] <kiboneu> well yeah narcism is a pretty sought for w.r.t. psychotherapists in nyc

[23:35:07] <pompolic> anyway to tie it up: i think if you've put over 9000 hours into identitycraft, "but i am <gender assigned at birth>" probably starts looking like a joke
[23:35:34] <pompolic> but that's starting to sound like "jailbreaking"
[23:36:44] <pompolic> i think i'm focusing on the wrong thing too. wrt transgression, i'd draw a distinction between transgressing for its sake and norms being not really salient
[23:37:02] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: hey it's that thing you were talking about yesterday https://github.com/SinaKhalili/Folders.py
[23:37:03] <Robomot> GitHub - SinaKhalili/Folders.py: Implementation of the Folders📂 esoteric programming language, a language with no code and just folders.
[23:37:03] <pompolic> how could they be, when they are not enforced by electrons and math
[23:37:32] <pompolic> i think with hardware people it's likely the latter, and i think on some level it's a correct insight
[23:37:34] <kiboneu> ok so, just finding a random device on the street -- say an ip camera -- and finding root on that. sure you're breaking the device, it's sort of funny now that you can run doom on it, but is that also a form of psychopathy?
[23:37:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: ... lol
[23:37:50] <pompolic> i'm arguing against it
[23:38:14] <pompolic> then again i don't know if i have a good model of how salient social norms are for psychopaths
[23:38:15] <kiboneu> oh yeah i accidentally skipped some lines
[23:38:28] <pompolic> i'm also not being clear, as usual
[23:38:40] <pompolic> transcribing vague intuitions as hard as i can
[23:38:53] <kiboneu> man so many questions, but im at work so i'm going to switch back to that
[23:38:59] <kiboneu> later
