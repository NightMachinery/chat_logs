[00:46:53] <matsaman> merpnderp: via root you mean?
[00:46:59] <merpnderp> Read /etc/passwd and then go through every line and see if it ends with a valid shell and if it does, split the line on : and use the first in the array to fix their password policy?
[00:47:03] <matsaman> or including potentially having to authenticate for each?
[00:47:05] <merpnderp> matsaman: yeah, this can run as root.
[00:47:19] <merpnderp> I need to update everyone's password policy
[00:47:23] <matsaman> ah
[00:47:33] <merpnderp> And for some reason I'm having to write a script instead of just doing it.
[00:47:38] <merpnderp> Because we have two whole servers.
[00:47:45] <merpnderp> And it's just impossible amount of work to do it twice.
[00:48:05] <matsaman> but they use PAM?
[00:48:13] <merpnderp> Some.
[00:48:19] <merpnderp> We have 3 accounts that don't.
[00:48:20] <matsaman> there's probably a global way to do it, and then we could also script it of course
[00:48:34] <merpnderp> root, and two others.
[00:49:03] <merpnderp> I should do this all in Perl or Javascript. Way easier.
[00:49:09] <merpnderp> But I'd have to run it as root.
[00:49:15] <matsaman> you can do it in perl as root
[00:49:18] <merpnderp> And I'm not running perl or js as roo.t
[00:49:24] <matsaman> I mean, also JS, but that's less common than perl by far
[00:49:27] <matsaman> oh okay =P
[00:49:56] <matsaman> anyway I think your idea will work fine
[00:50:05] <merpnderp> Okay, thanks for the sanity check :)
[00:50:46] <merpnderp> Wonder if I could just find a job writing some esoteric C++ some place that had actual sys admins to do the sys admining.
[00:50:53] <matsaman> if you wanted to be more fancy about it
[00:51:08] <matsaman> you could figure out how to evaluate the password policy of each user and if it's conformant to what you want
[00:51:11] <matsaman> and if not update it

[14:44:35] <jmd> Well seeing as you are wanting the minutae of detail.  I am loging in over ssh and not a virtual console.  But so as not to confuse people let us just assume that I want a method that will work for all methods of loging in: ssh/console/getty/gdm ....
[14:44:56] <akik> jmd: "sudo passwd -d username" removes the password

[15:08:16] <tomreyn> Guest22: since this is very recent information, the Ubuntu security team has not yet triaged how this vulnerability affects packages in Ubuntu (other than taking initial notes): https://ubuntu.com/security/cve-2021-44228
[15:08:17] <ubottu> Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been dis... <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228>

[21:13:53] <jhutchins> XoloX: I've never heard of an auto-rotate function. You'd have to have a driver that would interpret the output of the orientation sensor, then call sommething to process that as input for screen rotation, maybe through xrandr.
[21:14:23] <jhutchins> XoloX: It should be possible, there are several projects focused on tablet linux, but you'll probably have to look outside of ubuntu.

[21:29:23] <maxzor_> what do you mean?
[21:30:20] <maxzor_> I thought that given the errors in the log - arguments count being wrong in c functions... - the problem had to come from a mismatch between kernel and proprietary driver version
[21:31:09] <krisstern> Yeah, think so
[21:32:10] <maxzor_> what can I do? contact AMD to tell them their latest driver is not working with kernel 5.5? Reinstall amdgpu (non pro)?

[22:56:01] <maxzor_> krisstern! I just deleted all release candidate stuff in /boot/efi, update-grub2, rebooted, apt update && upgrade, rebooted, and here I am with my DE back :)
[22:56:05] <maxzor_> thanks again
[22:56:13] <krisstern> Cool!
[22:56:32] <maxzor_> now trying again to install those damned proprietary driveers
[22:57:13] <maxzor_> I have not matured enough my decision to try guix, so I chickened out on the fresh install :)
[22:57:47] <primejade> Hi, I'm on lubuntu 18.04.5, I was wondering is it possible to upgrade to the 20.04 and be able to still use this Desktop (LXDE) ?
[22:58:16] *** Joins: Tob_ (~tob@212.7.225.55)
[22:59:18] <lotuspsychje> primejade: i think lubuntu 20.04 is lxqt now, might give issues to lts upgrade from bionic
[23:01:16] <krisstern> maxzor_: Guix surely looks cool though
[23:02:02] <maxzor_> Yes it does, but learning monads, scheme, a dsl, dropping systemd for shepherd... that's a lot at once
[23:02:09] *** Joins: elcedro_83 (~elcedro_8@190.69.237.23)
[23:02:14] <krisstern> Yeah, agreed
[23:02:35] <maxzor_> + installing manually realtek drivers, like my debian days
[23:03:07] <krisstern> Thumbs up
[23:03:22] <primejade> lotuspsychje: Thanks
[23:04:29] <lotuspsychje> primejade: i would reccomend 20.04 lubuntu clean install, tested on a few boxes and its real solid
[23:06:41] <primejade> lotuspsychje: I will give it a shot, Thank you. I'm new to IRC btw XD
[23:06:59] <lotuspsychje> welcome to the ubuntu community primejade
[23:08:16] <primejade> Thank you :)))
