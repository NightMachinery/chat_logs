[14:29:02] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[14:29:28] <gahr> you've been busy :)
[14:29:56] <gahr> I am going to try the devel/pager2 branch out
[14:30:32] <flatcap> yep :-)
[14:30:34] <flatcap> thanks
[14:31:07] <flatcap> basic stuff works and I'm expecting a lot of the index functions to work unchanged
[14:31:26] <flatcap> and hopefully the rest will only need small tweaks
[14:32:05] <flatcap> it's a huge relief that it works at all :-)
[14:34:04] <gahr> pager/functions.c:106:20: error: unused function 'assert_mailbox_writable' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]
[14:34:07] <gahr> static inline bool assert_mailbox_writable(struct Mailbox *mailbox) ^
[14:34:08] <flatcap> I've also tried to draw a diagram of the new arch (not very successfully yet)
[14:34:10] <gahr> pager/functions.c:126:20: error: unused function 'assert_attach_msg_mode' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]
[14:34:13] <gahr> static inline bool assert_attach_msg_mode(bool attach_msg) ^
[14:34:16] <gahr> pager/functions.c:147:20: error: unused function 'assert_mailbox_permissions' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]
[14:34:19] <gahr> static inline bool assert_mailbox_permissions(struct Mailbox *m, AclFlags acl, char *action) ^
[14:34:53] <flatcap> hmm... that's odd
[14:35:21] <flatcap> by which I mean, the errors make sense, but I don't understand why I'm not seeing them
[14:35:35] <gahr> building with clang13
[14:37:08] <flatcap> strange, gcc normally complains (and I have -Werror on for good measure)
[14:46:11] *** Quits: wheeluser1 (~sh@user/wheeluser1) (Quit: WeeChat 3.5)
[14:46:24] <flatcap> gcc's still ignoring them.  I removed the functions and pushed
[14:46:39] <gahr> thanks
[14:47:15] <gahr> this fixes the issue that the pager goes away if you do change-folder, then +, right?
[14:48:22] <flatcap> yes
[14:49:32] <flatcap> the IndexSharedData holds the "current" Account/Mailbox/Email
[14:49:57] <flatcap> if any of those change a notification is sent and the Pager behaves correctly
[14:50:21] <gahr> nice
[14:50:26] <flatcap> the trickiest bit has been getting a $resolve failure to work correctly
[14:50:27] <gahr> I'll try and have a look at the code, too
[14:50:32] <flatcap> thanks
[14:51:21] <flatcap> when you hit the end of the Index list, technically, there's no change so no notification
[14:51:33] <flatcap> and the Pager doesn't really know what's going on...
[14:52:46] <flatcap> so the Index gives the Pager a helping hand: it sends a NULL Email notification, followed by a non-NULL Email notification
[14:53:17] <flatcap> the Pager does the right thing (TM) and anyone else (Index Bar, etc) still displays the right info
[14:55:19] <gahr> that sounds awful :D
[14:55:28] <flatcap> hehe, yeah
[14:55:39] <flatcap> it's one small concession to the Mutt way of doing things
[14:56:55] <flatcap> I've also discovered that viewing attachments also has the same pager-quit, update, pager-open mechanism
[14:57:29] <flatcap> because it doesn't involve the index, it's simpler (to ignore :-)
[14:58:58] <flatcap> and (another exception) is the Help screen (again not index-linked).  it needs to return, update, re-open on SIGWINCH (it does its own formatting)
[14:59:20] <flatcap> but I don't care about them!
[15:00:13] * flatcap is happy that PagerFunctions[] is reduced to just 19 functions :-)
[15:09:15] <gahr> yup the code removal is great :)

[21:26:59] <madduck> I am confused about $folder in neomutt. There seems to be a regression compared to mutt, or maybe I am missing a feature.
[21:27:25] <madduck> set folder="~/nmmail/x" â†’ /home/ssd/madduck/nmmail/x does not exist. Create it? ([yes]/no):
[21:27:32] <madduck> set folder="~/nmmailx" â†’ /home/ssd/madduck/nmmailx does not exist. Create it? ([yes]/no):
[21:28:10] <madduck> set folder="~/nmmail" â†’ neomutt starts on /var/mail/madduck (even though ~/nmmail exists, and neomutt -f ~/nmmail works)
[21:29:00] <madduck> Oh, it asks me to create those nonexistent folders, but it still starts on /var/mail/madduck
[21:31:18] <flatcap> I don't think we've broken anything $folder related...
[21:31:35] <flatcap> oh
[21:31:49] <madduck> i am sure you haven't. But I just can't figure out where it gets /var/mail
[21:31:54] <flatcap> make sure you're setting $folder before you use it in a `mailboxes` command
[21:32:21] <madduck> i don't have any mailboxes defined yet
[21:32:28] <flatcap> likewise $spoolfile
[21:32:34] <flatcap> oh
[21:33:24] <flatcap> /var/mail (or /var/spool/mail) is the standard (old Unix) home for mail
[21:33:37] <flatcap> (neo)mutt defaults to that if there's no config
[21:33:43] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[21:34:09] <madduck> right, so what's the config option to use to set the initial mailbox?
[21:34:39] <madduck> it works for my oldmutt and even though I copied the config to neomutt, neomutt behaves differently.
[21:34:52] <flatcap> set spoolfile = MAILBOX
[21:35:22] <flatcap> I've just tested a one-line config: set folder = "~/non-existent"
[21:35:34] <flatcap> and that gives me an error.  but shouldn't :-
[21:35:36] <flatcap> :-)
[21:35:45] <madduck> AAAAAAAAA
[21:36:12] <madduck> I will tell you what the problem is.

[21:37:24] <madduck> *WHY*?
[21:37:26] * madduck cries
[21:37:30] <flatcap> neomutt should be accepting both
[21:37:45] <flatcap> I renamed a lot of config for consistency (quite a while back)
[21:37:57] <madduck> yeah it does, but I actually have a script that generates the config file based on what's in the documentation ;) 
[21:38:00] <flatcap> but neomutt accepts all the old names (without complaint)
[21:38:15] <flatcap> wow!
[21:38:19] <flatcap> sounds scary
[21:38:19] <madduck> so not your problem. my problem.
[21:38:33] <flatcap> hehe, ok
[21:38:53] <madduck> it's quite easy. https://git.madduck.net/etc/mutt.git/blob/HEAD:/.config/mutt/mkconf
[21:39:08] <madduck> I've grown sick and tired of mutt introducing new features and me not finding out about them ;) 
[21:39:16] <flatcap> hehe
[21:39:33] <flatcap> I'll have a read and think about that (and $folder) later -- food time
[21:39:44] <madduck> enjoy!
[21:40:05] <flatcap> btw, neomutt doesn't have upstream's compose patch, but our multi-part email generation is MUCH better (imho)
[21:40:17] <madduck> oh, I'll gladly check it out.
[21:40:30] <madduck> of course, I co-authored mutt's, so the bar is high, but ;) 
[21:40:47] <flatcap> hmm... their workflow is pretty scary
[21:40:56] <madduck> i didn't like it at the time, but it works
[21:40:59] <flatcap> you run a script, but can't see the results in mutt
[21:41:13] <madduck> you can invoke a browser ;) 
[21:41:24] <flatcap> urgh! :-)
[21:41:31] <madduck> but yeah, i'll be glad to be shown better
[21:41:42] <madduck> as long as I can somehow control it because I spent a long time on that script.
[21:42:14] <flatcap> it's documented -- extra functions to group alternatives, etc
[21:42:28] <flatcap> and you can see the results
[21:43:00] <flatcap> what we haven't decided on (or implemented) is support for *linking* cid: references between multi-parts
[21:43:09] <flatcap> gotta go
[21:59:10] <madduck> hm, "nm_default_url must be: notmuch://<absolute path>"
[21:59:16] <madduck> and ~ is not expanded.
[21:59:28] <madduck> but $HOME is

[22:29:13] <madduck> the description of a virutal-mailbox should be showing up in the sidebar, but the query isâ€¦ is that by design?
[22:35:06] <jindraj> madduck: can you share your config?
[22:41:12] <madduck> just sidebar? I don't have my config online yet,as I am just experimenting.
[22:41:31] <madduck> sidebar is https://scratch.madduck.net/2022-04-04-201114-paste
