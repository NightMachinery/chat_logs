[03:01:10] <aplund> I have found some weird behaviour with notmuch virtual mailbox and flags.  If I toggle-new on a message so that it has no flags within the maildir, it removes the ':2,' from the filename and it seems to baulk up everything.
[03:02:38] <bookworm> baulk up?
[03:02:40] <bookworm> what do you mean?
[03:07:28] <aplund> bookworm: it changes 'mail/cur/17ee5e9401eeff36:2,S' to 'mail/cur/17ee5e9401eeff36'
[03:07:37] <bookworm> yes?
[03:07:41] <bookworm> that's a good thing?
[03:07:49] <bremner> that isn't valid in a maildir
[03:07:51] <aplund> I believe it should keep the :2,
[03:07:55] <bremner> correct afaik

[03:08:43] <aplund> bremner: this is correct?  it meses up all kinds of other things.
[03:09:20] <bremner> aplund: if you can duplicate it with just notmuch, then I think it's a bug.
[03:09:48] <bremner> I'd have to double check the rules for files in new/, but that wasn't your question
[03:10:15] <aplund> I'm not sure if notmuch is involved.  I just change the flags in neomutt's index...
[03:11:30] <bookworm> I see the same behavior on my system with neomutt, but that's not an issue as both notmuch and neomutt continue to work fine and the file is doing what it should (marked as seen or not, depending on the flag)
[03:12:38] <bremner> hrm. I did think the :2, was mandatory
[03:12:43] <bookworm> spec is rather... free form but says that you should add the info flag (:2,) when you move. >When you move a file from new to cur, you have to change its name from uniq to uniq:info.
[03:12:46] <aplund> I'll have to check which tool generates this, but I get messages like: '17ee5e9401eeff36' does not contain valid maildir delimiter, correct file name extension, or does not seem to have a valid GID, ignoring.

[03:28:54] <aplund> I think my settings are broken.  I can't see the difference between 'N' and 'O'  in a notmuch virtual folder.
[03:29:38] <bookworm> do you have the option set that it should ignore new and simply use N ?
[03:30:00] <bookworm> or what's "no difference" for you?
[03:30:23] <bookworm> mark_old is the option
[03:30:48] <aplund> bookworm: Actually, I haven't thought about it.  
[03:30:53] <aplund> ok
[03:32:27] <bookworm> out of the box neomutt essentially has 4 states, mail is either "new" or "old" and is either "seen" or not "seen" (imap speak) The difference between N and O is that both are unseen / unread but N is unread and "new" and O is unread but "old", meaning you've been looking at it already at least once
[03:32:34] <bookworm> some people like that for triaging
[03:32:55] <bookworm> I personally only want two states, it's either seen or not seen, hence unset mark_old

[04:18:44] <bookworm> yes, as you don't have "old"
[04:19:01] <bookworm> hence you only  toggle between new (it is in the new dir) or +S in the cur dir as read
[04:19:34] <bookworm> with the tri-state (set mark_old) you have N or O or read

[12:32:14] <aplund> is there any way to "remap" deletion in virtual folders (i.e. notmuch) to an action of removing a tag?
[12:34:27] <aplund> I realise I can remap a key for deletion, but there's some logic using tagged messages which would be nice to have without reinventing the wheel.

[16:26:31] <flatcap> mage: can you take a look at your 'sent mail' -- does that look normal?
[16:27:10] <flatcap> that should be exactly how the email was, when it left neomutt
[16:27:51] <mage> in my imap folder you mean?
[16:28:17] <mage> the mail is PGP signed, I don't know if it has anything to do with it
[16:28:29] <flatcap> yes, or we can do a clean test
[16:28:37] <flatcap> set mbox_type = mbox
[16:28:50] <flatcap> set the 'fcc' to ~/test.mbox
[16:29:03] <flatcap> send a plain text email to outlook
[16:29:18] <flatcap> and have a look at ~/test.mbox
[16:29:45] <mage> ok I'll try that (probably tonight)

[16:30:16] <mage> it's my gf email, I think the problem appears only in the mail app (but I'm not sure)
[16:31:25] <flatcap> ok

[18:36:01] <pekdon> Any notmuch users in here? If yes, how have you configured neomutt with it. Virtual folders only, IMAP or Maildir etc?
[18:41:05] <bookworm> virtual notmuch folders only
[18:43:58] *** Joins: epony (epony@user/epony)
[18:48:39] <pekdon> Apart from a consistency point of view, having all one way, any other benefits?
[18:49:24] <bookworm> well I can query my whole mail archive, what more do you need?
[18:49:50] <bookworm> why add another backend that looks at the exact same emails I already have in the virtual folders?
[18:51:05] <pekdon> Performance, query result size, sync back delay? (What do I know, moving over from sup and trying to make sense of the a decent way of configuring things as people seem to do it many different ways)
[18:51:15] *** Joins: blaub (~blaub@194-208-201-025.tele.net)
[18:51:28] <bookworm> the drawback there is that imap + notmuch don't sync in my case, so my imap view and my notmuch view differ. That's pk for me because I pre sort emails via sieve and don't bother with moving emails server side
[18:52:28] <bookworm> sync back is better than network traffic, so it beats imap. Maildir does the same operations (a few less) but probably not noticeably different
[18:53:00] <bookworm> as for result size, just limit it? Neomutt has window functions that move earlier / later in time
[18:53:36] <bookworm> I personally don't bother, last 2 months is fine for my usage so I hardcoded that in the query
[18:54:05] <pekdon> Sounds reasonable, and mail older than 2 months would be just as find to query for as to scroll and seach for.
[18:54:20] <bookworm> scrolling is worse
[18:54:34] <bookworm> you've got notmuch queries you can do on the fly
[18:54:45] <bookworm> sooo, use notmuch for gods sake ;P
[18:54:48] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[18:55:23] <bookworm> it beats the limit clauses of neomutt if you know what you are looking for approximately in my view
[18:56:51] <bookworm> notmuch needs quite a bit of setup to be useful (initial tagging and such) but once that's done email pretty much sorts itself
[18:57:43] <bookworm> my inbox only contains a few email (my todo list basically) and all mailing list stiff is appropriately filtered and has kill files and such in order to mute threads I don't wanna see
[18:58:04] <bookworm> s/files/tags/ Actually
[19:00:30] <pekdon> I intended to go for a notmuch only setup, then googled a bit and didn't find any post with such a setup so thought I should ask.
[19:03:15] <bookworm> email stacks are probably such that you won't find 2 which are exactly the same... for better or worse most people adapted various combination of tools to suit their needs
[19:03:56] <bookworm> mind you, my version is as good or bad as any other setup. It's the one that works for me
[19:04:08] <bookworm> ymmv
[19:05:55] <pekdon> Well, it works for you, and is similar to what I invisioned initially so I'll go for it.
