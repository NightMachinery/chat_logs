[00:12:45] <blkshp> Yes
[00:13:37] <GuiToris> Im super effin surprised!
[00:14:38] <GuiToris> I was like, he must be Minnesotan, let's look it up
[00:14:54] <blkshp> Why?
[00:15:27] <GuiToris> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't know what made me think that
[00:16:25] <GuiToris> I wanted to complain anyways, the other day I realized that I'd spent way too much time learning American English that I totally forgot about British
[00:16:37] <blkshp> Way of the world.
[00:16:45] <GuiToris> you had no problem decoding what that chav said
[00:16:54] <blkshp> Correct.
[00:17:10] <blkshp> I can mostly tell what anyone says!

[00:18:50] <GuiToris> this is actually quite surprising, because it was much less intelligible than American English, and I think you sometimes have problems with that
[00:18:55] <GuiToris> I'm not 100% sure
[00:20:13] <blkshp> Possibly but strangely I have a lot of experneice with decoding the bullshit that the locals say rather than the bullshit that Americans say.
[00:21:05] <blkshp> But, I think my experience with the accents of the UK (Including Scottish, Welsh and Irish) make me somewhat more lingual as we have hundreds within 200 miles rather than 50 over 5000 miles.
[00:21:14] <blkshp> Not a gloat but a matter of fact.
[00:21:22] <blkshp> (or presumed fact anyway)
[00:21:43] <GuiToris> there's an other one here, I listened to it a couple of times: https://youtu.be/avE5z46gOis?t=95   You (either 'are' or 'were' I can't decide) bettah than Saint Gian?
[00:21:59] <blkshp> Give me 20 minutes with that!
[00:22:19] <GuiToris> I'm glad you also have problems with that :D

[00:41:34] <KillAnimals> Its not 
[00:41:39] <blkshp> GuiToris: the humour of this statement doesn't translate.
[00:41:54] <KillAnimals> I've been writing poems in old "Anglish" from biblical inversions
[00:41:58] <blkshp> KillAnimals: You may post it someone may have the appropriate skills. I, however, do not.
[00:42:17] <KillAnimals> Here goes:
[00:42:18] <KillAnimals> Thou fearest not The Alfather's cust: What he brought here thou givest up.
[00:42:19] <KillAnimals> Thou Smitten all that he did reap; thou hears his whispers as ye sleep.
[00:42:21] <KillAnimals> Thou dreamy lord. His sweetly cup; spilling over as ye wake up,

[00:42:23] <blkshp> Sopt
[00:42:36] <blkshp> Are you looking to get yourself klined!?! lol
[00:42:53] <blkshp> but its shorter than I'd thought! ok. Next time though, pastebin :)
[00:43:26] <KillAnimals> blkshp: Yeah they are all short. If it was longer, I would use pastebin
[00:43:49] <blkshp> for any further, please use pastebin anyway
[00:44:06] <KillAnimals> blkshp: I don't want to get klined.
[00:44:41] <blkshp> It's ok, I didn't know you knew it might do that with long posts :) 
[00:45:04] <KillAnimals> So how does one evaluate poetry?
[00:45:20] <KillAnimals> The only thing concrete that I can think of, is whether or not it rhymes.
[00:45:43] <blkshp> Depends on the style i suppose.
[00:48:04] <KillAnimals> I think it has to be fun to read
[00:48:24] <KillAnimals> like there has to be a reveal at the end, which ties the poem together.

[12:34:11] <capjack[m]> I'm not sure whether I can use the possessive case when the owner doesn't really "own" the thing

[12:41:39] <capjack[m]> no with "women's scarcity" I mean there are too few women, there should be more women
[12:41:44] <fentanyl> LuisP18: I'm not sure why it's incorrect to use the past form of "withdraw" here though. Could you explain why?

[12:42:53] <OMGOMG> capjack[m]: "women's" means something belongs to the women
[12:43:58] <capjack[m]> OMGOMG: yes, so to say "there are too few women", can I say "women's scarcity" or do I need to say "the scarcity of women"?
[12:44:25] <OMGOMG> it would have to be "a scarcity of women" but "too few" is better
[12:45:16] <capjack[m]> so no possessive in this case?
[12:45:41] <OMGOMG> what do the women possess?
[12:46:13] <capjack[m]> On wordreference I also found the following example: "Local stores reported a scarcity of bottled water", and I don't think you can say "Local stores reported bottled water's scarcity", can you?
[12:46:53] <OMGOMG> it's bad grammar, but you understand what it mean
[12:47:14] <OMGOMG> because bottled water generally doesn't possess anything
[12:47:17] <OMGOMG> but women do
[12:47:34] <OMGOMG> "bottled water scarcity" would be ok
[12:48:31] <capjack[m]> OMGOMG: the women possess nothing. In a given firm or industrial sector, there are too few women, and this causes adverse economic outcomes, for example, wage gap or gender stereotypes. I need to say that because there are too few women, then there are gender stereotypes. So either "the scaricity of women causes gender stereotypes" or "women's scaricity causes gender stereotypes"
[12:49:00] <OMGOMG> capjack[m]: if the women possess nothing, don't use the possessive
[12:49:03] <capjack[m]> *So either "the scarcity of women causes gender stereotypes" or "women's scarcity causes gender stereotypes"
[12:49:57] <capjack[m]> OMGOMG: ok thanks
[12:50:11] <capjack[m]> but why can you say "people's choices" then? The people doesn't really "own" the choice

[13:13:37] <Belamos> would anyone who's good in both,  thinking and English help me out here?
[13:13:44] <Belamos> there is a sentence that makes no sense at all
[13:15:07] <Belamos> QUOTE:
[13:15:08] <Belamos> >> The Company’s assets shall be deemed owned by the Company as an entity, and the Member shall have no ownership interest in such assets or any portion thereof. Title to any or all such Company assets may be held in the name of the Company, one or more nominees or in “street name”, as the Member may determine.
[13:15:26] <Belamos> what's with the "street name" ?!
[13:15:33] <Belamos> that wouldn't even make sense,  if "street name" were a variable to be replaced by an actual street name
[13:16:08] <Me-me> Perhaps it means street name as in, the nickname one obtains in an urban culture.
[13:16:30] <Me-me> Though that seems flimsy in a legal context.
[13:16:37] <Belamos> what nick name?   That's an Operating Agreement for an LLC
[13:16:44] <OMGOMG> raffaem: "the flu" is a sensible answer to "to whom or what do the effects belong", but you can't say the same for women and scarcity. the scarcity belongs to society, or something more abstract
[13:16:47] <Belamos> I got this from the "organizer" who helped me form the LLC
[13:17:08] <OMGOMG> raffaem: i agree that it's difficult/subtle
[13:18:05] <pussipupu> It's possible that the company is sometimes known by its address, that happens
[13:19:00] <Belamos> I don't believe that.
[13:19:08] <Belamos> I know the name of my own LLC
[13:19:11] <Belamos> it's not a street name
[13:19:19] <Me-me> But another reader might not.
[13:19:43] <Belamos> then why don't they say "the company" as they referr to it throughout the entire operating agreement?

[21:53:19] <GuiToris> hello, does gravy = sauce, or it's a specific sauce?
[21:54:37] <pussipupu> In BrE it's a sauce made from meat juices
[21:55:27] <pussipupu> I think in AmE it's much broader, I've seen pictures of “gravy” in American that was something white
[21:55:57] <pussipupu> Hmm, according to Wiktionary in the Southern US, “gravy” is like béchamel with meat juice, so that would explain it
[21:56:55] <GuiToris> I tend to keep asking cookery questions, and in realty I can't cook at all
[21:57:07] <GuiToris> where did you read about gravy?
[21:57:07] <huf> this kind of vocabulary is the hardest
[21:57:15] <GuiToris> just wiktionary?
[21:57:30] <huf> probably wiki and also all over the internet
[21:57:46] <huf> i bet there's lots of youtube videos talking about different kinds of gravy
[21:57:55] <GuiToris> I got you
[21:58:01] <GuiToris> for the very first time!
[21:58:04] <huf> i recently watched one about cider meaning different things in US vs UK
[21:58:17] <GuiToris> there's lots<- this is not the real huf
[21:58:21] <GuiToris> he can't make mistakes!
[21:58:25] <GuiToris> he's an impostor!
[21:58:33] <huf> ?
[21:58:55] <huf> the contracted form of "there are" is very often there's
[21:58:58] <huf> it's just one of those things
[21:59:22] <huf> there are no rules. people can fly.
[21:59:55] <pussipupu> “there're” exists but yeah, generally “there's" just doesn't change for number
[22:00:12] <pussipupu> IIUC American “cider” is just apple juice
[22:00:13] <GuiToris> huf, yeah I know, you didn't swim to the US, did you! :P
[22:00:25] <pussipupu> I dread to think what they'd give you if you asked them for a glass of apple juice...
[22:00:29] <huf> pussipupu: unstrained apple juice
[22:00:33] <huf> with pulp
[22:00:53] <pussipupu> Ah right, so like fresh stuff from the press
[22:00:56] <huf> hence their phrase hard cider
[22:01:05] <huf> which is known as, you know, cider
[22:01:07] <huf> even in hungary
[22:01:09] <huf> szájder
[22:01:10] <MetaNova> one whole apple, with peel, stem, and core, blended
[22:01:11] <pussipupu> Which to be fair is amazing, but we still turn most of it into cider
[22:01:25] <pussipupu> Blended not pressed?
[22:01:36] <huf> pussipupu: according to that video, it's all down to prohibition
[22:02:22] <pussipupu> Prohibition makes even less sense with respect to cider than most drinks though
[22:02:48] <pussipupu> “Whoops I dropped some yeast in my apple juice, guess I'd better store it in the cellar for a couple of weeks so the yeast wears off”
[22:02:52] <huf> apparently the cider breweries all switched to fresh-off-the-press stuff to avoid all the nonsense
[22:03:11] <huf> and when alcoholic cider was revived, the name "cider" was already taken
[22:03:43] <pussipupu> That does kinda make sense
[22:06:01] <huf> but yeah home made cider never stopped, probably
[22:06:11] <huf> what are you gonna do, set a guard on every person?
[22:06:32] <huf> and a guard on every guard? it's a losing game
[22:06:55] * pussipupu hands their guard a nice glass of apple juice
[22:07:01] <pussipupu> We cool, barry?
[22:08:29] <pussipupu> Spirits I can see meaningful control on, but things like beer and cider just require a bucket and an airlock
[22:08:55] <huf> it doesnt really work on spirits either
[22:09:12] <huf> you just need some metal bits and water and heat
[22:10:29] <pussipupu> Yeah but occasionally you explode if you get it wrong
[22:10:42] <pussipupu> If you get cider wrong you just sometimes go blind and/or mad from the methanol
[22:11:06] <pussipupu> Though to be fair you can do freeze distilation if you live somewhere cold, like with traditional applejack

[22:24:17] <enick_937> Methanol is only a concern for fermented fruits if you do distillation.
[22:24:30] <enick_937> (or for fermented grain)
[22:24:56] <enick_937> I believe the only time you get substantial amounts of methanol without distillation is if you're fermenting wood, but I'm hazy on that
[22:27:10] <pussipupu> Hmm, I know that old cider sometimes had toxic levels of methanol, but maybe the vessels were attacked by the acids?
[22:28:06] <pussipupu> Of course older cider sometimes also contained overtly toxic levels of lead...
[22:28:28] <enick_937> Freeze distillation or steam distillation can concentrate the methanol if you do it wrong.
