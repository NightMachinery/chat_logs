[00:08:36] <avidal> right. i realized this happened when i switched to 0.5 awhile back, since that's when i also switched to init.lua and packer instead of vim-plug: i didn't migrate any plugins for a fresh start, but i *had* been using python-support.nvim which automatically stabilized my python_host_prog
[00:08:56] <avidal> just haven't been writing python for a few months so i didn't notice it until recently

[07:27:56] <dre> LordRishav, you don't need to install nvim-lspconfig or really nvim-lsp-installer, just read this part: https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#jdtls
[07:28:48] <dre> 1. have env vars, 2. put " require'lspconfig'.jdtls.setup{} " in your init.vim / init.lua 
[07:28:53] <dre> should be as simple as that.
[07:30:26] <LordRishav> dre: I have installed jdtls server from the AUR, so I don't know where to keep JDTLS_HOME
[07:30:38] <dre> can you start it from the cmdline? 
[07:30:44] <LordRishav> I can
[07:30:47] <dre> then just do "which jdtls" 
[07:30:51] <dre> it'll tell you where it is 
[07:31:13] <LordRishav> /usr/bin/jdtls
[07:31:20] <dre> but that's to the binary, the settings and configurations ??(??)? might be in /usr/share/jdtls or something
[07:32:10] <dre> LordRishav, alternatively you could do "find /usr -iname '*jdtls*' " and it should find everything on your system with jdtls in the path
[07:32:49] <dre> or the AUR might've already set the env vars, try "echo $JDTLS_HOME "
[07:33:17] <LordRishav> It is in /usr/share/java/jdtls
[07:33:24] <dre> neat 
[07:33:31] <dre> set that as env-var and it should be good to go? 
[07:33:38] <LordRishav> Let me try
[07:35:08] <dre> if you start up, have no errors, and can load up a file and put the cursor on something, you should be able to do ":lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()" and it will go to the definition. 
[07:35:23] <mjlbach[m]> I'd recommend nvim-jdtls over lspconfig
[07:35:25] <mjlbach[m]> source: lspconfig maintainer
[07:35:31] <dre> then just bind it to a key and you're good to go 
[07:36:28] <LordRishav> dre: It doesn't show an error but LSP still doesn't seem to work
[07:36:44] <LordRishav> mjlbach[m]: I tried nvim-jdtls and it didn't work as well
[07:37:09] <mjlbach[m]> I promise you it works better than lspconfig
[07:37:21] <dre> :p 
[07:37:38] <mjlbach[m]> lspconfig has a semi-strict no-off spec policy
[07:37:47] <mjlbach[m]> nvim-jdtls is a dedicated plugin for handling jdtls

[07:40:56] <dre> mjlbach[m], do you rememer that "wxyz_abcd" text completeions that the lsp was giving me the other day? 
[07:41:15] <dre> how can I go about debugging that? 
[07:41:41] <dre> look for jedi (the ls) configuration options/ 
[07:41:42] <dre> ? 
[07:41:52] <mjlbach[m]> dre: I do not
[07:42:05] <mjlbach[m]> you'll have to refresh my memory
[07:43:17] <dre> you know what, i think I've found it anyway. I think it was null-ls
[07:44:26] <dre> mjlbach[m], basically every autocomplete menu was getting swamped with silly TEXT entries. i'll be auto-completing "my_function_name" and it'd bring up 50 completion entries like "amy_function_name" "bmy_function_name" "cmy_function_name"
[07:44:37] <dre> removing null-ls seems to have stopped it though
[07:44:53] <mjlbach[m]> they added completion support
[07:44:56] <mjlbach[m]> I still don't understand why
[07:45:06] <mjlbach[m]> but they did, so it's probably that, I imagine there is some way to disable it
[07:45:08] <LordRishav> mjlbach[m]: So well, I tried nvim-jdtls again and it doesn't seem to work
[07:45:20] <mjlbach[m]> I can promise you it works
[07:45:31] <mjlbach[m]> I, who have never done java, got it to work haha
[07:45:40] <mjlbach[m]> there's a youtube video on how to set it up
[07:46:09] <dre> mjlbach[m], ye cheers. I mean, I don't think null-ls was doing what I wanted to anyway, so removing it for now is also suitable option. 
[07:46:11] <mjlbach[m]> https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/qvgzhr/video_explaining_how_to_set_up_nvimjdtls/
[07:46:22] <LordRishav> Maybe I am just a fool here, I'll have to see the video then
[07:47:04] <mjlbach[m]> nah it does involve setting 4 things manually which may not be intuitive
[07:47:12] <mjlbach[m]> idk I just followed the instructions blindly

[11:39:39] <kylo252[m]> flip214: shot in the dark, there's a timeout for regex matching
[11:41:38] <kylo252[m]> if I can get this reviewed, there seems to be a few patches that we can get but are probably easier once that is merged
[11:41:38] <kylo252[m]> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/16336
[11:42:03] <flip214> kylo252[m]: I don't know how I would use treesitter... that's an strace file, I don't think treesitter has syntax for that
[11:42:17] <flip214> a few (~10) seconds of nvim use, posix_get_monotonic_timespec'        750165 times called
[11:42:30] <flip214> not sure whether that's the problem or just a symptom
[11:43:01] <clason[m]> you can use (neo)vim's internal profiling

[11:45:22] <flip214> hmmm, strongly correlates with the number of lines...
[11:45:44] <flip214> If I split my window vertically (upper half :help syntime), scrolling to the right goes much faster - about half the delay
[11:46:05] <kylo252[m]> out of curiosity, is it faster or slower on vanilla vim? 
[11:46:57] *** Quits: kevr (~kevr@user/kevr) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[11:47:04] <kylo252[m]> since it's basically the same file: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/87a053f126c79f5eeb1654e35beb31d9fe733163/runtime/syntax/strace.vim#L5
[11:47:29] <flip214> vanilla vim scrolls half a window when I get to the border... but the actual redraw is about the same speed
[11:47:42] <flip214> syntime says slowest thing is    0.001471   15     1       0.000248    0.000098  helpURL            \v<(((https?|ftp|gopher)://|(mailto|file|news):)[^' ^I<>"]+|(www|web|w3)[a-z0-9_-]*\.[a-z0-9._-]+\.[^' ^I<>"]+)[a-zA-Z0-9/]

[11:49:27] <flip214> which is matchparen
[11:49:55] <flip214> but 0.23 secs _total_ time, for about 15 scrollings to the right with a second each, doesn't sound that bad
[11:51:18] <flip214> With :NoMatchParen scrolling is a wee bit faster, perhaps 0.9 secs per character instead of 1.0

[11:57:02] <kylo252[m]> I feel like that should've been the easiest 
[11:57:17] <clason[m]> well, go write a parser then
[11:57:29] <kylo252[m]> theoretically at least, being machine-parsable and all y'know 
[11:57:48] <clason[m]> (not parser -- that exists -- but queries)
[11:58:49] <kylo252[m]> is `matchit` the one that does the highlight on CursorHold as well?

[22:38:10] <dundargoc> Good thinking!
[22:38:21] <dundargoc> We should move neovim there.
[22:39:06] <mjlbach[m]> but muh free CI
[22:39:28] <dundargoc> We pay with our sanity.

[22:41:04] <thoth[m]1> dundargoc: Yeah - that's much better than github or gitlab, but self-hosting ANYTHING is most of the time better

[22:43:11] <dundargoc> Single-file repos are the worst.

[22:44:49] <dundargoc> Basing arguments around single-file repos, which should in practice be rare, is silly.

[22:51:33] <busf4ct0r> I hated using mercurial
