[13:00:32] <gtlsgamr> pkill tmux
[13:03:54] <Abhi[m]> <gtlsgamr> "Kaafi philosophical vibes aa..." <- I went to a god damm physicologist now because a girl left me , I was sure something is abnormal about me mentally . It's just insane
[13:04:18] <gtlsgamr> So what did the shrink say?
[13:17:58] <SurajKushwah[m]> <gtlsgamr> "So what did the shrink say?" <- tldr; someone pointed out issues with Education System. and started blame game. 
[13:17:58] <SurajKushwah[m]> I said - We should blame ourselves because we are the one who always choose evil and immoral.
[13:23:48] <gtlsgamr> I was talking about the shrink.. but okay XD
[13:24:18] <Abhi[m]> <gtlsgamr> "So what did the shrink say?" <- Theirs nothing wrong with you . You are completely okay but were in a toxic relationship with a god damm physico
[13:24:39] <SurajKushwah[m]> <Hemish[m]> "> <@telegram_989399820:t2bot.io>..." <- even idk what he said. because it's basically like "maa chudaye duniya, just think everything is fine and be cool"...

[13:25:16] <Abhi[m]> So you see both things hurt , you go to college , you can say being in relationships is cringe . And get away , or you can do that and go to a god damm shrink thinking you are fucking mentally abnormal
[13:25:17] <Abhi[m]> God
[13:25:18] <Abhi[m]> Fuck
[13:25:49] <gtlsgamr> Wow. Pretty fucked up people out here
[13:25:55] <gtlsgamr> glad to know I am sorted
[13:27:17] <Abhi[m]> gtlsgamr: That's what I thought
[13:28:01] <gtlsgamr> But this is one thing I have noticed since a while.. people tend to romanticize sadness and depression
[13:28:07] <gtlsgamr> not pointing you, but in general
[13:30:05] <Hello[m]> > <Suraj Kushwah> even idk what he said. because it's basically like "maa chudaye duniya, just think everything is fine and be cool"... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/778063eebc22ce726a4f8096eb643b7314ca203a)
[13:30:59] <Abhi[m]> gtlsgamr: Yes. That's the reason after trying everything I learned from internet and seeing it is not improving went to get help because I wanted to get out
[13:31:06] <Abhi[m]> Glad I went
[13:32:53] <Abhi[m]> Cheating develops insecurities and trama , and when these people manipulative it just increases soo much . Ps - cheating is one of the most tramatic thing one can experience and seeing them togather  just after 2 mins breakup it just breaks you
[13:33:50] <Abhi[m]> So get help don't be like me , I wasted 2 months on this girl thinking something wrong with me and things , should have gone a month before
[13:33:54] <SurajKushwah[m]> Abhi[m]: actually, you are wrong. it's not about running away. 
[13:33:54] <SurajKushwah[m]> You need to learn to handle it. you had a break up. accept it. Accept your darkest truth. 
[13:33:54] <SurajKushwah[m]> Learn how to accept it. 
[13:33:54] <SurajKushwah[m]> At first when I get into a completely new way of looking at world .. I also find myself getting disturbed you might look at myself and see a fucked up person. But in my life I am pretty sorted. I said all this because here we get some intellect you will listen, in real world out .. no one gonna listen.

[13:37:34] <Abhi[m]> SurajKushwah[m]: Yes
[13:37:39] <Abhi[m]> That's fair
[13:37:40] <Abhi[m]> Then
[13:37:43] <Abhi[m]> I get it
[13:38:09] <Abhi[m]> But just saying , sone people are god damm manipulative and will purposefully mess with you and cheat on you
[13:38:35] <SurajKushwah[m]> Abhi[m]: emotions are good. 
[13:38:35] <SurajKushwah[m]> but emotions should never be our driving factor.
[13:38:35] <SurajKushwah[m]> if you just use basic logic and think with brain and do what you brain knows right. You will never need a therapy,
[13:39:00] <Abhi[m]> I don't want to talk about this , being with that guy waiting just beside by bicycle is just pethetic and you do this just after a day
[13:39:26] <Abhi[m]> * a day after breakup
[13:39:32] <Vaibhav[m]> Abhi[m]: can't agree more to this
[13:40:17] <SurajKushwah[m]> Abhi[m]: dude why you are a pussy?
[13:40:20] <SurajKushwah[m]> be an ass.
[13:40:56] <Abhi[m]> You don't know the full story I spare you the details with just one world , I went to a god damm physicologist ,and some people are really evil and manipulative and you should stay away
[13:40:56] <SurajKushwah[m]> u are sounding like a pussy. a weak guy.
[13:41:12] <Abhi[m]> I hope you guys never ever meet such people

[13:44:09] <SurajKushwah[m]> Abhi[m]: Always remember. World only sympathize with weak.
[13:44:09] <SurajKushwah[m]> They never like. People just like power. 
[13:44:09] <SurajKushwah[m]> Every movie character you ever loved is not because he was just GOOD. it's because he had power.
[13:44:21] <NeoVoid[m]> No I wasn't necessarily pointing at someone nor i was talking about blue pill shit. what I was talking about was kinda sorta lika accepting red pilled situation without loosing your mind and control your life with your actions shit cuz just like you like to own your operating system. Treat yourself and your mind as a OS too. Own your mind control your mind. Become the freaking wizard.
[13:45:15] <NeoVoid[m]> also i came here to post this stuff

[13:52:33] <SurajKushwah[m]> Abhi[m]: the way you looking for help .. is making you more weak.
[13:52:49] <NeoVoid[m]> Abhi[m]: I can understand its like how i felt when i found someone already discovered the concepts centuries ago i thought i found just overthinking in 30 minutes. 😂

[14:00:41] <bugswriter> NO FUCK NO
[14:00:48] <Abhi[m]> No
[14:00:50] <Akshay[m]1> Tor[m]: Dont.

[14:01:36] <SurajKushwah[m]> ok
[14:02:26] <Abhi[m]> > <Neo Void> dont be cringe. When I was at your time. I used to think the same. And as being drawn to those things I didn't have i neglected those moments i could have, what I could learn and empower myself with. Now I am in regret to loosing those precious moments of life i could live and enjoy but i lose them...

[14:02:31] <Tor[m]> Tech support ka toh alag se bana sakte hai na ?
[14:03:35] <SurajKushwah[m]> Abhi[m]: u are so full of emotions. I can see this from here. let me guess. People always dominate u right?
[14:03:43] <SurajKushwah[m]> Tor[m]: No
[14:04:22] <Akshay[m]1> Tor[m]: Y?
[14:04:46] <Tor[m]> Are kisiko doubt aaye toh directly uspe daal de
[14:05:07] <Akshay[m]1> Y not here?
[14:05:08] <Tor[m]> Agar conversation divert na ho jaye
[14:05:08] <gtlsgamr> bugswriter: Kyon bully kar raha usko
[14:05:32] <Tor[m]> Dono ke liye accha hoga
[14:05:53] <Tor[m]> Suggestion tha bhai
[14:06:06] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: u know I was used to get bullied in school. but after 10th. I changed myself. instead of looking for emotional support from others. I learned to control over my emotions and fun fact, I ended controlling people.
[14:06:12] <relejek[m]> Tor: i get you dost. may be put that proposal again later.
[14:06:19] <relejek[m]> it is workable idea.
[14:06:23] <SurajKushwah[m]> Tor[m]: nahi wese bhi ab mai kuch kaam ka kaam karunga.
[14:06:47] <gtlsgamr> Bahot acha kiya bhai. Great work on improving yourself. 
[14:07:25] <Akshay[m]1> This group is not that big to make different groups for sub topics
[14:07:46] <SurajKushwah[m]> Akshay[m]1: but what's the problem ? why we have to make different groups?
[14:07:49] <relejek[m]> Suraj Kushwah:  that turned out good for your bugs. but i won't praise your method. coz that might encourage others to take risk with/ignore their mental health
[14:08:16] <relejek[m]> and i respect your hardwork that your did on yourself.
[14:08:25] <gtlsgamr> @bugswrite You still don't have a job. Your linux channel is still.. okayish at best. You are here trying to tell people to improve themself while you are still stuck in that half-student half-jobless phase. What are you doing better than Abhi[m] ? Being an asshole? In my book that's just a way to hide your own insecurities 
[14:09:51] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr:  bhai come'on . could be put better. everyone has their speed in life. let's not comapre.
[14:09:55] <SurajKushwah[m]> relejek[m]: yeah well nothing we can do about it. world is full of people who really don't care and too selfish. 
[14:09:55] <SurajKushwah[m]> in order to survive we have to do this. we also have to be selfish. like if u think about some friend's issue all night and next day that friend treat you like shit . u ll feel bad .. so this is why .. u won't think about friend's issue and just be selfish. so u don't feel bad.
[14:10:04] <relejek[m]> i like bugs's content
[14:10:15] <gtlsgamr> relejek[m]: That;s what I am trying to say. WHy is he putting down Abhi[m] ? There is not need to compare.
[14:10:16] <Tor[m]> Bhai yaar link bhejo
[14:11:06] <relejek[m]> Tor:  which link dost?
[14:11:38] <Tor[m]> Bhai kisika blog ,channel ho
[14:11:39] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: u know I can get job. I got skills and stuff. But here I am. struggling with my principles. I don't want to end up fueling Evil or some stupid rat race .. my shitty fate. 
[14:11:39] <SurajKushwah[m]> also he was okay sharing his personal stuff so we were talking about it. But I have no interest sharing my personal stuff here. so lets not
[14:12:09] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr: yes i read some of the convo above betn bugs and abhi. that was not cool of bugs but lets not take side to attack but to defend.
[14:12:30] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: also I was not being an asshole. I was literally ..breaking my rules to help him out. in my own way.
[14:13:29] <Vaibhav[m]> Koi accha Notes taking app suggest karega? Kuch fancy nahi simple go-to type
[14:13:31] <relejek[m]> Tor:  hitarth has some good content for mahabharat lovers. i recommend. hitarththummar.xyz/
[14:13:33] <gtlsgamr> I think you are trying to hide the fact that you haven't been able to progress in life by putting him down. I have seen your skills they are mediocre at best. Look at pystardust, he writes better scripts than you, and he is a fuckin maths graduate. Stop trying to pull emo shit out here man. Peace and love is all we need.
[14:13:39] <gtlsgamr> Vaibhav[m]: I suggest joplin
[14:13:42] <gtlsgamr> I love joplin
[14:14:17] <Govindas[m]> <Abhi[m]> "Cheating develops insecurities..." <- experienced it a few times, but didn't make a big deal out of it, just forgived the person, nothing traumatic to me personally
[14:14:22] <Akshay[m]1> <SurajKushwah[m]> "but what's the problem ? why..." <- I am saying " don't make".
[14:14:35] <Vaibhav[m]> gtlsgamr: okay thanks, I will check it out
[14:14:41] <relejek[m]> Vaibhav[m]: if you prefer writing in markdown in android then super simple is [MARKOR]. super lite, i use it.
[14:14:45] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: yeah it's not a competition, all I am saying do u really think I don't have enough skills to get a basic job?
[14:15:17] <gtlsgamr> And yet you don't have one. Maybe you have the skills but the lack the motivation that you speak so highly of.
[14:15:25] <relejek[m]> Vaibhav: yes other one is joplin. 2 second that. seemless sync and uses for win, mac, tux, and android.
[14:16:32] <Vaibhav[m]> relejek[m]: finally something has a sync for all devices
[14:17:20] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: I don't have job because I don't apply for jobs, because most jobs are just SHIT. asking to do work which adds nothing to society, I believe in doing good work instead of being selfish. 
[14:17:20] <SurajKushwah[m]> like I do on my OkAYish channel. I might don't have money from it. because I don't monetize it. but atleast I get messages where people tell me they get inspired .. 
[14:17:20] <SurajKushwah[m]> I believe my work is far better than ..any stupid job those coorporate money whores do.
[14:18:33] <Tor[m]> <relejek[m]> "Tor:  hitarth has some good..." <- Poems acchi hai , 98 wala Mahabharata dekhna baki hai mera ( thoda thoda hi dekha hai ) 
[14:19:01] <gtlsgamr> Thats a messiah complex my guy. What you do is already being done by hundreds, if not thousands of others. YOu are a part of the same system you are trying to defame. And you won't gain anything by pulling people down. Instead, try to lift them up.. maybe you will see the better world that you hope to see someda
[14:19:14] <gtlsgamr> Tor[m]: Mahabharat dekho bhai, bahot kuch sikhne ko hai
[14:19:31] <Tor[m]> gtlsgamr: Bhai padha hai maine 
[14:19:41] <Tor[m]> Bas dekha nahi hai
[14:19:58] <Tor[m]> gtlsgamr: 100% baat sach hai
[14:20:20] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: I was asking him to be emotionally strong where, which is personal issue. you are adding it with societies issue.
[14:20:36] <Tor[m]> gtlsgamr: Sabse badi baat Mahabharata ki yeh hai ki sab villian aur sab hero the 
[14:21:27] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: also I am not your guy. also so what what I do have been already done by hundreds? also why are you talking what I do? 
[14:21:27] <SurajKushwah[m]> am I asking you what you do?
[14:21:45] <gtlsgamr> I thought this was a "free" channel
[14:21:57] <gtlsgamr> I am allowed to say stuff, the same way you are allowed to say stuff to others
[14:22:11] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: not personal stuff.
[14:22:14] <gtlsgamr> Tor[m]: Exactly! Sab hero aur sab villian
[14:22:15] <SurajKushwah[m]> you can say general things.
[14:22:24] <gtlsgamr> SurajKushwah[m]: You did call Abhi[m] out on personal stuff too
[14:22:34] <gtlsgamr> that was way more personal than what I said
[14:22:38] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: because he was talking about it. He was telling us.
[14:22:53] <Tor[m]> Koi poora galat nahi koi poora sach nahi ( maybe except krishna  )
[14:22:56] <SurajKushwah[m]> he was asking for emotional support so I told him be strong. I never told him. u did wrong because u ..did this and that girl or what
[14:23:05] <gtlsgamr> So you create exceptions based on your convenience. That is not very good of you. SurajKushwah[m] 
[14:23:10] <gtlsgamr> Free is free
[14:23:11] <SurajKushwah[m]> there is line between getting personal and talking generally
[14:23:12] <relejek[m]> Suraj Kushwah:  suraj chill, you're dissing on JOB people. we're cool with that up to some extent but that's like 90% of world population that works for someone and not for themselves like you or me.
[14:23:31] <relejek[m]> you can't win the world if you are fighting against it.
[14:23:49] <gtlsgamr> relejek[m]: I work for someone and for myself. I have multiple sources of income. That doesn't mean you should act better than those who are in time of need
[14:24:08] <gtlsgamr> So if you think I am some pleb who works a 9 to 5 and sleeps soundly, you are wrong
[14:24:11] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: you work in a corporate I guess, it's basic manners. to not publically point out someone personal stuff out like this
[14:24:32] <gtlsgamr> Basic manners also include not calling someone a pussy. but you did.
[14:24:42] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr:  bhai i am on your side. trying to defuse the sit.
[14:24:55] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: oh god, that's the guys talk. You are being idiot.
[14:25:25] <SurajKushwah[m]> I mean I can say "gtlsgarm you are being a pussy" 
[14:25:25] <SurajKushwah[m]> But I can't say "gtlsgarm your gf left you and now you are doing shitty marriage " or any of your personal stuff like that
[14:26:00] <relejek[m]> i get where suraj is comming from. coz i was there once. doesn't mean he and i are alike in any way. just saying. i get him but today i respect people from all walk of life
[14:26:46] <Tor[m]> relejek[m]: Bhai side kaha hai sabhi ek hai
[14:26:58] <gtlsgamr[m]> > <@telegram_442770166:t2bot.io> I mean I can say "gtlsgarm you are being a pussy" 
[14:26:58] <gtlsgamr[m]> > But I can't say "gtlsgarm your gf left you and now you are doing shitty marriage " or any of your personal stuff like that
[14:26:58] <gtlsgamr[m]> But you can say that. Free speech is free speech. You can't put a limit on free speech
[14:27:15] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr[m]: no this isn't what Free Speech means ..WTF
[14:27:37] <SurajKushwah[m]> you just told everyone I am looking for a job and struggling with it.
[14:28:01] <SurajKushwah[m]> I told u this in DM. not in public. this is not a matter of public debate. I never pointed out one single thing which was personal
[14:28:16] <SurajKushwah[m]> to Abhi. I just told him some general stuff like be strong don't look for others.
[14:28:29] <gtlsgamr> wait what the fuck are you talking about. I don't remember you telling this to me in DM. This is public knowledge
[14:28:30] <SurajKushwah[m]> he was the one who was point out his personal stuff and I was stopping him. because I know it's not good
[14:28:50] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: oh u forgot? on irc I told u.
[14:29:04] <SurajKushwah[m]> personally? we were having a talk?
[14:29:10] <gtlsgamr> Fuck no bro
[14:29:13] <Tor[m]> Bas yaar chodo kaha jhagda karne baithe ho enjoy karo
[14:29:42] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: fuck yes. I remember u forgot. I asked u about znc
[14:29:48] <gtlsgamr> i think you mistake me for someone else. I know this because in channel you talked about how you don't wanna go corporate and wanna do your own thing and shit
[14:29:50] <SurajKushwah[m]> this is how u know ,that I am looking for job
[14:29:54] <gtlsgamr> yes we talked about znc
[14:29:57] <gtlsgamr> definitely
[14:30:13] <SurajKushwah[m]> yes at that time I also told u .. wait u do job in gujrat right?
[14:30:16] <gtlsgamr> lets meet in PM no point in flooding the channel
[14:30:18] <SurajKushwah[m]> u told me this ..at that time that's how I know
[14:37:34] <Tor[m]> @room yaar bolo abhi technical queries aur memes ke liye alag se channel ban na chahiye ?

[18:21:21] <o0o> one of my relative had a amd athlon pc with an old nvidia gpu
[18:21:33] <o0o> booting linux with proper graphics was pure pain
[18:22:25] <NeoVoid[m]> it looks better now
[18:23:04] <NeoVoid[m]> zorin os turn into such beautiful butterfly over the years
[18:23:18] <o0o> noice
[18:23:44] <NeoVoid[m]> they are doing really good job at desktop computing
[18:24:01] <Hello[m]> NeoVoid[m]: Bro is it lite or core edition of zorin?
[18:24:30] <NeoVoid[m]> it should be the first distro to be shown to newcomers.
[18:24:41] <NeoVoid[m]> Hello[m]: core
[18:25:17] <Hello[m]> NeoVoid[m]: Okhay
[18:26:30] <Hello[m]> Yeh  lite edition also is pretty good on resources to try liv
[18:27:14] <o0o> yeah zorin is nice, but too much eye candy
[18:27:36] <o0o> linux mint bess :P
[18:31:54] <relejek[m]> what's your view on: void-linux claims to be stable and rolling release at that.
[18:32:14] <relejek[m]> could that be your daily driver?
[18:32:14] <NeoVoid[m]> o0o: the thing about these "perfect build" distros they bored me quickly
[18:32:15] <NeoVoid[m]> 😂😂
[18:32:54] <NeoVoid[m]> relejek[m]: yeh i can live with it .
[18:33:39] <NeoVoid[m]> it has mysterious harry potter like addictive vibe
[18:33:49] <relejek[m]> what zoring?
[18:33:55] <NeoVoid[m]> no void
[18:33:59] <relejek[m]> zorin* has HP vibes?
[18:34:08] <relejek[m]> oh it does!?!
[18:34:17] <NeoVoid[m]> that you get hooked up on it
[18:34:21] <NeoVoid[m]> yes void
[18:34:54] <relejek[m]> how is void and HP be vibin same for you?
[18:35:49] <relejek[m]> 🙄
[18:36:27] <relejek[m]> yeah their website does gives slythrin vibes, coz green
[18:36:40] <relejek[m]> 😅
[18:43:20] <NeoVoid[m]> <relejek[m]> "how is void and HP be vibin same..." <- no i don't mean its same as hp. 
[18:43:20] <NeoVoid[m]> it just as hp so void
[18:43:33] <NeoVoid[m]> their vibes are different
[18:43:41] <o0o> NeoVoid[m] we cant add things easily like suckless tools, too much work
[18:43:47] <o0o> bur good for newcomers
[18:44:15] <NeoVoid[m]> yeah
[18:44:27] <o0o> deepin was my fav distro when i started using gnulinux :p
[18:45:58] <Ankit[m]12> <relejek[m]> "what's your view on: void-..." <- Well gnome 41 which was released a month ago is still not in void repos so idk about that rolling release model
[18:46:14] <NeoVoid[m]> what package is that to be installed for proprietary codecs to installed 
[18:46:14] <NeoVoid[m]> restricted extras?
[18:47:14] <NeoVoid[m]> Ankit[m]12: their rr model is kinda "safer"
[18:47:14] <NeoVoid[m]> means it wont include new stuff until they stable or 2 months older
[18:47:35] <o0o> gstreamer plugins? NeoVoid[m]
[18:48:08] <NeoVoid[m]> to play videos
[18:48:36] <relejek[m]> Ankit: yeah they claim to be on the stable side and not on the cutting edge.
[18:48:57] <relejek[m]> they are 'safer'? i can't say
[18:49:43] <NeoVoid[m]> yes its ubuntu-restricted-extras

[18:50:09] <MohdAariz[m]> "atleast its free tho"
[18:50:09] <relejek[m]> they are slow on rr so you don't have to worry/stay-alert every time you are to update your system unlike arch users has to.
[18:50:53] <NeoVoid[m]> relejek[m]: so that makes it perfect to run on servers
[18:51:02] <relejek[m]> Mohd Aariz:  bruh you haveing a dig at linux users in a linux community group. i respect your bravery lol.
[18:51:18] <MohdAariz[m]> Lmao
[18:51:28] <o0o> void is nice, i wouldn't mind using it as my next distro
[18:51:31] <MohdAariz[m]> i too use arch linux

[18:51:37] <relejek[m]> NeoVoid[m]: not necessarily . it has still to prove its metal.
[18:51:58] <NeoVoid[m]> relejek[m]: how so
[18:52:10] <relejek[m]> entp people will always go with better service than cutting edge. so radhat or ubuntu.
[18:52:29] <relejek[m]> oh yeah for your personal server. sure go ahead my guy.
[18:52:34] <Arya[m]> <gtlsgamr> "Omicron cases" <- holy
[18:53:09] <o0o> Ankit[m]12 distros cant simply release gnome updates like other programms and desktop environment, it's gonna break ton of extensions and useres are gonna get mad

[22:08:17] <gtlsgamr> what does that mean
[22:08:18] <bugswriter> yes
[22:08:23] <bugswriter> I mean I have a nginx.conf
[22:08:26] <gtlsgamr> ok
[22:08:37] <bugswriter> file and instead of adding /usr/local/letsencrypt again and again
[22:08:45] <bugswriter> I just want to make a variable so .. no dups

[22:13:09] <bugswriter> nginx: [emerg] "set" directive is not allowed here in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
[22:13:53] <gtlsgamr> send your config
[22:15:07] <bugswriter> no I think I got this
[22:15:14] <bugswriter> its because nginx not allowed set on top
[22:15:40] <gtlsgamr> it has to be in a server block
[22:17:38] <bugswriter> http://0x0.st/orG0.conf
[22:17:48] <bugswriter> here it is. help me out I think it's still not working
[22:19:31] <bugswriter> it stop giving error at set but instead of variable value it's using $variable_name it's not replacing with value
[22:21:25] <gtlsgamr> try putting in quote
[22:21:28] <gtlsgamr> the path
[22:21:30] <gtlsgamr> bugswriter:

[22:23:16] <bugswriter> dude @gtlsgamr it's not working
[22:23:39] <gtlsgamr> ah
[22:23:41] <bugswriter> putting quotes looks like. it's setting the variable with set but it still showing $le_path instead of real path
[22:24:00] <gtlsgamr> no no are you putting quotes in the path after set?
[22:24:50] <bugswriter>  https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/lvwovh/taking_notes_in_org_mode_has_made_me_popular_with/

[22:26:37] <gtlsgamr> gimme a dsec 
[22:26:40] <gtlsgamr> sec
[22:29:42] <gtlsgamr> bugswriter: 
[22:29:56] <gtlsgamr> looks like the `set` command is not meant to be used that way.. nginx developers said so.
[22:30:07] <gtlsgamr> read this mailing list: -----> https://forum.nginx.org/read.php?2,143479,143502#msg-143502
[22:30:18] <gtlsgamr> They recommend using sed to do your substituiton
[22:31:57] <bugswriter> so basically there is no way
[22:31:57] <bugswriter> ?
[22:32:29] <gtlsgamr> bugswriter: check this out.. This could also be a factor https://serverfault.com/questions/508794/custom-nginx-configuration-variables-not-being-expanded
[22:33:05] <gtlsgamr> try adding / before $
[22:34:41] <bugswriter> I did .. MISSION FAILED
[22:34:47] <gtlsgamr> anyway I am gonna go to sleep now. But my suggestion is instead of trying to do it from within nginx, just use `le_path` everywhere you want and then '%s/le_path/actual\/path\/to\/certs/g`
[22:35:19] <bugswriter> yeah
[22:35:23] <bugswriter> thanks
[22:36:40] <gtlsgamr> bye all!
