[13:31:07] <jotham> hey Renderwww 
[13:31:12] <jotham> best way to go into 2022
[13:31:14] <jotham> is firingup.mp3
[13:31:17] <jotham> https://jotham.co/firingup.mp3
[13:31:24] <jotham> give it a prenudge
[13:31:30] <jotham> i geneuinely have written so much code to that track
[13:31:34] <jotham> and i have no idea where it came from
[13:31:42] <jotham> the guy that made slither.io gave it to me one day
[13:38:10] <T`alZHeimeR> so ebay went officialy into the scammer side
[13:39:44] <jotham> wasn't it always
[13:40:05] <jotham> consume regional classified add communities, hollowing out regional paper revenues
[13:40:09] <jotham> -d
[13:40:17] <jotham> and then homogenize it and take a cut
[13:40:24] <jotham> liek the essence of the internet
[13:40:32] <jotham> that's why we have no more local papers either
[13:41:11] <jotham> you could call it silicon valley vc but it's more simple than that, homogenization of the function means that no one local can ever compete on it
[13:41:27] <jotham> ebay was just one of those vectors that destroyed local communities
[13:41:36] <jotham> here in nz we tried to fight it because we hate foreigners
[13:41:43] <jotham> but still the same problem happened here just not with ebay
[13:41:53] <jotham> all the small advertisers and sellers died
[13:41:56] <T`alZHeimeR> they blatently lie, confirm they lie, take no responsabilities. I coudl probably sue. but not for 9â‚¬
[13:41:57] <jotham> except the weird bit is this
[13:42:10] <jotham> facebook marketplace gave all the weird and local sellers their power back
[13:42:15] <jotham> ??!?!
[13:42:30] <jotham> so mega evil foreign corp overcomes local corp that defeats mega evil foreign corp
[13:42:32] <jotham> it's very weird

[14:24:24] <jotham> Renderwww: churrr
[14:25:27] <Renderwww> I once went to a Jeroen Tel concert in amsterdam
[14:26:13] <jotham> god we just get like, rod stewart?!
[14:26:18] <jotham> that osunds fun
[14:27:56] <markuskj> did he turn on a c64 and let it play
[14:28:17] <Renderwww> he also pretended to twiddle some nobs and push some buttons
[14:36:07] <jotham> hey Renderwww 
[14:36:12] <jotham> can i ask a quick question
[14:36:14] <Carbonflux> happy new year jotham :)
[14:36:25] <jotham> how in the fucking shitlordfuckcuntgodarsehole
[14:36:29] <jotham> are you steam level 54
[14:36:33] <jotham> and what does that even mean
[14:36:44] <jotham> my most neurotic gamer cousin is only level 45
[14:36:53] <jotham> cheers Carbonflux 
[14:36:57] <Renderwww> no clue what it means
[14:37:08] <Renderwww> I guess collecting badges from trading cards?
[14:37:09] <Carbonflux> how do you check your number?
[14:37:14] <jotham> whatever you're running some scam
[14:37:19] <jotham> Carbonflux: roll over any avatar
[14:37:24] <jotham> i'm 14
[14:38:17] <jotham> i never really wondered about 'number goes up' in a context i dgf about
[14:38:18] <Renderwww> also just having a shittone of games in the steam library gives "xp"
[14:38:20] <jotham> but now i'm curious
[14:38:28] <jotham> cause i feel like Renderwww is one of us
[14:38:35] <jotham> well iu have a lot of games too
[14:38:47] <jotham> and play them a lot
[14:38:51] <jotham> there must be some other reason
[14:39:01] <Renderwww> https://imgur.com/a/fUIQ6Qg
[14:39:08] <Renderwww> not sure if playing them helps at all
[14:39:13] <Carbonflux> i am level 10
[14:39:20] <jotham> okay okay
[14:39:34] <jotham> i have 436 games and i've basically played most of them for 10+ hours
[14:39:42] <jotham> 2730 is a bit much
[14:39:45] <jotham> I WILL BACK OFF
[14:40:05] <jotham> i guess it makes sense steam would encourage collecting games over playing games
[14:40:09] <jotham> perfect scanrio
[14:40:19] <jotham> anyone that plays a game is a tech support burden 
[14:40:26] <Renderwww> also during sales or steam events if you click some random shit you get badges too
[14:40:26] <jotham> but owning a game makes you a collector
[14:40:32] <Renderwww> like voting for steam awards
[14:40:48] <jotham> yeah i was just curious why you had a level almost as high as my most neurotic steam gaming little cousin
[14:40:50] <jotham> haha
[14:40:57] <jotham> where as lal the normal people i knew had like my similar score
[14:40:59] <jotham> like Carbonflux 
[14:41:29] <jotham> you must be diddling the clitoris of the algorithm in some bespoke fashion
[14:41:41] <jotham> or dumping all your meat money, now you're a vegan, into games that suck
[14:41:50] <markuskj> playing video games also makes you violent which means you're spending time away from purchasing more of them
[14:41:53] <jotham> SAUSAGES OR THE SIMS BUNDLE?!
[14:42:04] <jotham> that's a good point markuskj 
[14:42:18] <Renderwww> now you can infer the level of my mental illness by a simple rule of three computation!
[14:42:48] <jotham> none of us wanted to be involved in your sex crimes
[14:42:55] <jotham> lets wind back the tape
[14:43:03] <jotham> congrats on your very normal steam usage, Renderwww 
[14:43:07] <Renderwww> I just throw money at whatever cheap ass game bundle I can find
[14:43:12] <jotham> hope the bread queue will be good to you today
[14:43:13] *** Joins: hinst (~Username@ip5f5ad1b5.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de)
[14:43:29] <jotham> maybe you get a double jabbed loaf and a gold star from the state sponsor elon musk
[14:43:39] <Renderwww> decided to not go outside today
[14:43:58] <jotham> don't you have to go outside to work in his battery factory
[14:44:02] <jotham> or does he have a hyper loop
[14:44:03] <Carbonflux> i heard Elon Musk is attacking the Chinese space station.
[14:44:07] <jotham> between your city and hamburg
[14:44:23] <jotham> thats a bit of a misexplanation Carbonflux 
[14:44:56] <Carbonflux> ya, but still, it appeared in my head.
[14:45:00] <jotham> the chinese moaned that his space vandalism was getting in the way of their space station, which is probably their problem, but also the ESA said it's a massive risk to competition in space
[14:45:27] <Carbonflux> well, it means their orbit is really low for a space station.
[14:45:40] <jotham> but also he's said if they don't get the starship working they will go bankrupt
[14:45:50] <jotham> so it's literally a race to vandalise LEO
[14:45:55] <jotham> so china might be right on that front
[14:46:04] <jotham> and europe is just moaning about anti competition like normal
[14:46:37] <jotham> (entire point of starship is to dump maybe 400k+ sats into LEO, which falcon can't do cost effectively, but is the only way starlink makes a profit)
[14:46:39] <Carbonflux> but personally i like the idea that Elon Musk is to blame for this western neo-colonialist space aggression.
[14:46:41] <jotham> so china is a bit right on that topic
[14:46:48] <jotham> also so is EU
[14:46:56] <jotham> but also so is elon, since no one else is doing it
[14:47:09] <jotham> i wouldn't call elon attacked by china
[14:47:23] <jotham> so much as he's been called out by china because of the business relaties of his economy of scale
[14:47:31] <jotham> and the west is just eating the cum of billionares
[14:47:32] <Carbonflux> to be serious, he really has been spamming low earth orbit, i am not sure its right.
[14:47:37] <jotham> like a bunch of flat headed npc mongoloids
[14:47:47] <jotham> right
[14:47:50] <jotham> that is chinas point
[14:47:53] <jotham> and it's about to get a lot worse
[14:48:01] <jotham> in his own words
[14:48:05] <jotham> this entire project is a waste of time
[14:48:09] <jotham> without starship
[14:48:14] <jotham> so he can spam thousands more
[14:48:18] <jotham> that's what china is upset about
[14:48:23] <jotham> and the ESA
[14:48:42] <jotham> the problem with china and the west is
[14:49:02] <jotham> china has lots of legitimate concerns the west ignores because it just rides the dick of billionares constantly 
[14:49:16] <Carbonflux> yup
[14:49:18] <jotham> and that gets mixed up with china actually being evil
[14:49:54] <jotham> so anyway, elon is definitely attacking the chinese
[14:50:00] <jotham> it's like the vaccination project right
[14:50:02] <Carbonflux> ya
[14:50:08] <jotham> most of the conspiracy arguments coming out of america
[14:50:13] <jotham> involve the presupposition
[14:50:23] <jotham> that palces like korea, australia, germany, uk, france, etc
[14:50:29] <jotham> aren't capable of doing their own science
[14:50:46] <jotham> all of the antivax crap depends on the idea that it's a big club of people working together
[14:50:58] <jotham> it's a very weird jingoistic way to look at geopolitics
[14:51:05] <jotham> the idea originally came up with the moon landing
[14:51:44] <jotham> like why hasn't any high powered satellite or high orbital mission just said, the americans are liars
[14:51:59] <jotham> i mean russia, china, america, all suffer from this conceit
[14:52:05] <jotham> the world is built from many actors
[14:52:12] <jotham> not just some random cunt superpower
[14:52:53] <Carbonflux> i don't know, i think there is a global intelligencia that does share a common mindset and accepts arguments from "credibility" authority without unpacking them.
[14:53:16] <jotham> that's an american fantasy from being a superpower into its old age
[14:53:34] <jotham> there is not a homogenized culture 
[14:53:46] <Carbonflux> there is a layer tho
[14:53:57] <Carbonflux> and i do think its homogenized.
[14:54:12] <Carbonflux> you might see it as "professionals."
[14:54:20] <jotham> there is no reason iran, south korea, new zealand, australia, france, denmark, profit off perpetuating a lie from donald trump
[14:54:28] <jotham> when we don't even legally allow the same medical bodies
[14:54:42] <jotham>  it's a very conceited world view
[14:54:50] <jotham> the conspiracy depends on america being special
[14:54:53] <jotham> that's why it's dumb
[14:55:04] <Carbonflux> yet within all that is the same "expert" culture that shares the same reality model.
[14:55:13] <jotham> why wouldn't the rest of us just join up to out perform america (this is what is happening fwiw) and leave you guys to starve
[14:55:17] <jotham> and then pick your bones clean
[14:55:17] <Carbonflux> its the same as when the Church was dominating the world.
[14:55:22] <jotham> they don't
[14:55:32] <jotham> experts are always tempered by the social climate
[14:55:37] <jotham> that's why it always 'depends'
[14:55:44] <jotham> and why different outcomes from the same data occure
[14:55:49] <jotham> that's my entire point
[14:56:01] <Carbonflux> blaming America for everything prevents you from seeing the actual state of world culture.
[14:56:06] <jotham> your entire world view as an american depends on you guys being the super nation
[14:56:16] <jotham> i'm not blaming america for anything
[14:56:32] <jotham> i'm saying that the conspiracy theories all depend on usa #1 or usa being the only real culture
[14:56:43] <jotham> you know i spent years telling you specifically to join the world
[14:56:48] <jotham> and we never really came to terms on that
[14:56:50] <jotham> before the pandemic
[14:56:55] <jotham> it's just the same thing happening again
[14:56:56] <Carbonflux> the Intelligencia is global, you just don't see it because its right in front of you.
[14:57:02] <jotham> that's a fantasy
[14:57:11] <Carbonflux> you are part of it really
[14:57:12] <jotham> korea cares about very different ideas to the australians
[14:57:30] <Carbonflux> tech people, science people, smart people
[14:57:34] <Carbonflux> they all think the same
[14:57:46] <Carbonflux> its a reality model.
[14:57:57] <jotham> why do you call it blaming america
[14:58:06] <jotham> when the entire message is america should join into the world
[14:58:20] <jotham> and the world is an argumentitive place
[14:58:46] <Carbonflux> it sounds more like America should do what you think is right.
[14:58:53] <jotham> okay
[14:59:03] <jotham> rather than just see what's going on, aye
[14:59:09] <jotham> america should either do or do not do
[14:59:15] <jotham> rather than just see what everyone else is doing
[14:59:19] <Carbonflux> this "join the world" thing is too abstract.
[14:59:21] <jotham> that's how you've lensed it
[14:59:23] <jotham> haha
[14:59:27] <jotham> you fucking massive pedophile
[14:59:38] <jotham> i have wanted nothing more than america to join in with the rest of us
[14:59:42] <jotham> rather than do what i think is right
[14:59:46] <jotham> it's explicitly a plural concept
[15:00:55] <jotham> since george bush junoir, the biggest dumbarse the republicans have fielded in decades, it's been all unilateral 
[15:01:02] <jotham> you guys refuse to just join in with the rest of us
[15:01:05] <jotham> to figure anything out
[15:01:16] <jotham> it's not me telling you what is right
[15:01:19] <jotham> it's participation
[15:01:20] <Carbonflux> the rest of who? you live on a small Island which is an instance of Europe, just like America is, you blame America for European culture and say they should join the "rest of the world." These arguments are sophistry.
[15:01:26] <jotham> yeah you got me Carbonflux 
[15:01:44] <jotham> if that's the extent of your mental acumen, i'm done for
[15:02:02] <Carbonflux> we are all done for.
[15:02:15] <jotham> well your fatalist self servicing bullshit definitely isn't helping
[15:02:35] <jotham> nz is absolutely a tiny little nation, that politically has no real heft, but we still engage with other countries on an equal level
[15:02:48] <jotham> join the world is a very positive concept
[15:03:03] <jotham> not some dicatorial treatise
[15:03:07] <Carbonflux> it helps a lot, because, i care, i care a lot, you can tell because of my shinny eyes.
[15:03:55] <jotham> you're probably exactly right about america being european culture
[15:04:02] <jotham> i did find that when i went to germany
[15:04:04] <Carbonflux> seriously, you are blaming America for European ideas. 
[15:04:06] <jotham> but i'm british culture
[15:04:15] <jotham> and we're alien to europe at quite an aggressive level
[15:04:22] <jotham> so you're right but in a funny way
[15:04:22] <Carbonflux> i never hear you blame Europe for anything.
[15:04:31] <jotham> what did i blame america for
[15:04:34] <jotham> name one, quick
[15:04:39] <Carbonflux> its all back to Europe.
[15:04:53] <jotham> yeah but lets do apples to apples
[15:04:55] <jotham> what did i blame america for
[15:04:57] <jotham> name one, quick
[15:04:58] <Carbonflux> for a kind of cultural colonialism.
[15:05:03] <jotham> nope
[15:05:26] <jotham> america is too lazy to see the larger cosmopolital nation of the world, europe was forced to through at least two world wars
[15:05:27] <Carbonflux> oh, well my mistake then.
[15:05:29] <jotham> next
[15:05:39] <jotham> yeah but lets do apples to apples
[15:05:42] <jotham> what did i blame america for
[15:06:24] <Carbonflux> thats nonsense, Europe is toxic and has learned nothing from these wars other then a new self righteous narrative. 
[15:06:39] <jotham> americans claim they are cosmopolitan while 50% of them believe a group of lies that only work if america was the only country
[15:06:59] <jotham> europeans claim they are cosmopolital while 50% of them believe a group of lies that only work if africa doesn't exist
[15:07:05] <jotham> it's apples and pears mate
[15:07:13] <Carbonflux> na, you just have this America bashing meme, it means nothing at this point.
[15:07:18] <jotham> yeah you got me
[15:07:27] <jotham> please explain why you find join the world offensive
[15:07:31] <jotham> haha
[15:07:34] <jotham> cause i hate america
[15:07:36] <jotham> that's the answer right
[15:07:39] <jotham> haha
[15:07:41] <jotham> fuck off
[15:08:03] <jotham> most of your views about the vaccine involve no other countries having good scientists
[15:08:09] <jotham> or different economic systems
[15:08:11] <Carbonflux> i realize you feel invaded by "American" culture, but you are just blaming the messenger.
[15:08:20] <jotham> yeah but that's not what's on the table now
[15:08:26] <jotham> that's why i gave the moon landing example
[15:08:36] <jotham> how is it that all the scientists on the entire planet disagree with you
[15:08:46] <jotham> is it because 1- foreigners don't exzist
[15:08:53] <jotham> 2- foreigners do exist but are paid for by america
[15:09:01] <jotham> 3- foreigners are stupid
[15:09:14] <jotham> like why would a diverse collection of people all conclude that vaccination is a good idea
[15:09:20] <jotham> without the same political aims
[15:09:44] <jotham> so riddle me that
[15:09:57] <T`alZHeimeR> you need to chill jotham :p
[15:10:21] <T`alZHeimeR> https://xkcd.com/386/
[15:10:25] <jotham> Carbonflux's conspiracies only work if the rest of the planet is either a fiction or a tier two enterprise
[15:10:29] <Carbonflux> well, my Steam level is only 10, so i just don't know, i will defer to my betters.
[15:11:11] <jotham> and, that's why the americans need to join the rest of the planet
[15:11:18] <jotham> so they don't assume the rest of the planet is a fiction
[15:12:07] <jotham> very smart central europeans built the basis of most of contemporary physics
[15:13:07] <Carbonflux> i worry that you envy our greatness and that is the true source of your vitriol.
[15:13:24] <jotham> haha naah it's way simpler than that
[15:13:33] <jotham> you know how important comedy is right
[15:13:40] <jotham> it's a kind of thing like playing when you're a kid
[15:14:03] <jotham> i was brought up on uk comedy and i find american comedy to be extremely tedious, and i know it's totally cultural
[15:14:11] <jotham> that's the basis of any issue i have with american exceptionalism
[15:14:27] <jotham> bad at being funny 
[15:15:15] <jotham> also, it can't be expressed enough, even if two people both speak english, it doesn't mean culturally they are the same
[15:15:27] <jotham> but the trade dominant power always sets the tone of the situation
[15:15:41] <jotham> even if it's stupid, because the trade submissive wants the trade
[15:15:53] <jotham> so anything you guys ever hear is always coloured by robbery or approbation
[15:15:59] <jotham> so you have to naturally live a false life
[15:16:06] <jotham> not your fault at all
[15:16:17] <jotham> but you've totally diverted from the core issue here
[15:16:20] <jotham> why not join the world
[15:16:29] <jotham> i dunno why this has been a 2 year project of hostility from you
[15:16:36] <jotham> i find it very ridiculous at this point
[15:17:09] <Carbonflux> your "join the world" thing is an impossible condition because it has no meaning.
[15:17:16] <jotham> haha
[15:17:22] <Carbonflux> you can't not be part of the world.
[15:17:24] <jotham> we've spent literally 2 plus years discussing this
[15:17:33] <jotham> all you have to do is participate rather than dictate
[15:17:38] <Carbonflux> you just don't like American culture.
[15:17:39] <jotham> you're dicatating to me right now
[15:18:18] <jotham> i don't like germans but i like their output
[15:18:28] <jotham> i don't like americans but i liek their output largely
[15:18:30] <Carbonflux> i don't know, i don't think you are required to like American culture.
[15:18:44] <jotham> also it strikes me both countries are quite similar, having lived amongst both of your white populations
[15:18:59] <jotham> americans freak out over swearing
[15:19:08] <Carbonflux> sounds like handwaving to me.
[15:19:08] <jotham> germans freak out over being on the wrong side of the footpath
[15:19:15] <jotham> i don't know what that means
[15:19:50] <Carbonflux> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-waving
[15:20:00] <Faux>  Just think of what Carbonflux does whenver you say anything.
[15:20:00] <jotham> i am genuinely curious why you are so actively against the idea of being part of the world you've gone from rage quit outrage, to violent outbust, to weird psycho trauma against me, to now gas lighting me over it
[15:20:02] <Faux> It's that.
[15:20:03] <jotham> over like 4-5 years
[15:20:32] <jotham> maybe it's as simple as being a contrarian
[15:20:36] <jotham> i know that's fashionable
[15:21:13] <jotham> has someone done an ML model / experiment on just gas lighting / contrarian vs pretend complaince as a pattern for viability 
[15:21:23] <jotham> i think i'm strong pretend complaince
[15:21:43] <dukwon> Hello, hello, what's going on? What's all this shouting? We'll have no trouble here. 
[15:21:52] <Faux> Shut it flat foot.
[15:22:10] <jotham> uhm dukwon pressure is on
[15:22:13] <jotham> it's presently 2022
[15:22:22] <jotham> that means cern has to upstage 2020 and 2021
[15:22:25] <Carbonflux> i think its always been the case that Europe has the best self validating narratives, they have taken the blame for anything really, England most of all, America is just a expression of Europe, if you don't like America, look to Europe and the UK.
[15:22:27] <jotham> by possibly letting an old one in
[15:22:57] <jotham> Carbonflux: i don't see how 'join the rest of us' causes you to get hives and then scream EUROPE IS SHIT TOO
[15:23:01] <jotham> it's a very very weird response
[15:23:05] <jotham> and i've told you that for more than 2 years
[15:23:08] <dukwon> imagine living in tomorrow
[15:23:09] <jotham> sort yourself out cunt
[15:23:28] <Carbonflux> American does not even exist as a specific culture, its just grab bag of European ideas.
[15:23:45] <jotham> 'join the rest of us' -> I WILL FUCKKKIN KILL U
[15:23:49] <jotham> that's how you're behaving
[15:23:52] <jotham> for multiple months
[15:24:03] <dukwon> is this about rust?
[15:24:06] <jotham> i do not at all understand what is going on
[15:24:14] <jotham> i think so dukwon 
[15:24:42] <Carbonflux> ya, jotham does not like some aspects of rusts implementation so he is blaming America for it.
[15:24:55] <jotham> asking america to come into the pool and chillax
[15:25:01] <jotham> = me blaming america for some programming language
[15:25:06] <jotham> stop being a pedophile Carbonflux 
[15:25:09] <jotham> come on mate
[15:25:17] <jotham> 'join us' isn't some massive disrespect of your values
[15:25:27] <Carbonflux> come on yourself, "join the world" is trolling.
[15:25:32] <jotham> nope
[15:25:43] <jotham> american exceptionalism is why the uk acts like little shitty turd dogs
[15:25:54] <jotham> and why you guys flushed the kurds down the drain
[15:26:03] <jotham> and are in general going to be subsumed by china
[15:26:04] <Carbonflux> ya, because America is the only nation ever to see itself as exceptional.
[15:26:07] <jotham> and china is fucking terrible
[15:26:15] <jotham> no way, the uk absolutely did for ages
[15:26:20] <jotham> but that doesn't make it right?
[15:26:23] <jotham> haha
[15:26:25] <jotham> come on mate
[15:26:29] <jotham> you're fucking smoking your own dick
[15:26:35] <jotham> we could globally work as a concordance
[15:27:19] <Carbonflux> based on what you think is right
[15:27:20] <ERROH> what are we hating us and carbo for this week?
[15:27:40] <jotham> he is calling me names for saying the US should be more collaborative with the other democracies
[15:27:47] <Carbonflux> for not joining the world ERROH 
[15:28:18] <jotham> his argument, correct me if i'm wrong, is
[15:28:30] <Carbonflux> heh, like i have power over that.
[15:28:32] <jotham> the social democracies all have a history of absolute shitcunts running them
[15:28:46] <ERROH> i can't think of any topic i could have with carb that would have any value for any of us
[15:28:48] <jotham> but right now maybe we all just get it together
[15:28:53] <Carbonflux> how much power do you have over government policy jotham?
[15:29:02] <jotham> Carbonflux: compared to you?
[15:29:09] <ERROH> remember he got mad at me because i told him tng or another farscape is space opera?
[15:29:22] <ERROH> his argument was that there was no singing in those shows
[15:29:24] <Carbonflux> i don't remember that
[15:29:34] <ERROH> i do
[15:29:54] <Carbonflux> ah, you lying 
[15:29:59] <jotham> Carbonflux: quorum size means i have probably more local democratic control than you and more national democratic control than you, also we have a mixed member system, which means if any grievance gets more than 5% of the political vote it gets an actual real force in the government, so all our governments are coalitions of grieved parties, and realistically it's very regulated and quite
[15:29:59] <Carbonflux> that fair enough
[15:30:02] <jotham> democratic
[15:30:07] <jotham> Carbonflux: on sum, i think probably a shitload more than you?
[15:30:17] <ERROH> i mean, your head is so up your arse i see no point
[15:30:51] <ERROH> so the most interesting part of this exchange is how ham finds it amusing to keep using energy on it
[15:30:58] <jotham> Carbonflux: also here is the biggest reason i have more political control than you
[15:31:06] <jotham> Carbonflux: NO ONE IN NEW ZEALAND THINKS YOU SHOULD LIKE A POLITICIAN
[15:31:10] <jotham> YOU AMERICANS ARE FUCKING INSANE
[15:31:13] <jotham> IT'S NOT A CELEBRITY
[15:31:19] <jotham> IT'S AN ASSHOLE YOU HAVE TO PICK
[15:31:46] <jotham> so yes i believe i have way more democrati control than you, but i also think that's an unfair comparison because i don't have a federal system to deal with
[15:32:01] <jotham> and you guys all celebritize everything
[15:32:07] <jotham> because of childhood molestation?!
[15:32:09] <jotham> who knows
[15:32:58] <jotham> but yeah i was just lamenting today i don't know who my new local candidates are, and i've only been here a month, but you can actively nudge the needle in a country this small with many members in an election
[15:33:15] <jotham> you should join the world and give mixed member proportion representation a go
[15:33:18] <jotham> the germans invented it
[15:33:27] <jotham> even at a state level
[15:36:23] <Carbonflux> ERROH, you use energy on hating too, i don't think you are exempt from the temptations of self validation thru bullying.
[15:37:06] <ERROH> i'm not exempt from anything
[15:37:22] <ERROH> i just highlight that interacting with you is a waste of time imo
[15:37:55] <Carbonflux> thats just because you are so much smarter than me.
[15:38:16] <ERROH> i strive and search my limitations
[15:38:20] <jotham> < Carbonflux> gotta paint the sarcasm on so thick that americans notice it
[15:38:42] <ERROH> when you hit your limitations you deepaquechopra your way around it
[15:38:48] <jotham> anyway i'm not interested in internet hostility
[15:38:58] <jotham> but i'm so fucking deeply, to the level of nazi scientist
[15:38:59] <Carbonflux> be serious ERROH, you are an asshole, and you enjoy it. I kind of respect it after all this time.
[15:39:03] <jotham> fantastically fascinated
[15:39:13] <jotham> by why Carbonflux thinks it's a hostile act to ask him to join the world
[15:39:22] <jotham> and i will spend the rest of my life trying to figure this out
[15:41:11] <Carbonflux> its not hostile, its trolling.
[15:41:36] <jotham> why is it trolling
[15:41:38] <Carbonflux> we all know trolling when we see it.
[15:42:58] <ERROH> shorturl.at/axPQ8
[15:43:15] <jotham> anyway
[15:43:25] <jotham> i don't like this
[15:43:34] <jotham> Carbonflux: i genuinely like talking to you
[15:43:39] <jotham> and i don't like how it turned weird
[15:43:42] <jotham> especially at new year
[15:43:49] <jotham> but i will persue this idea in the future
[15:43:54] <jotham> but right now it seems just shitty
[15:44:01] <jotham> no one needs to sit around and eat cold sick
[15:44:03] <Carbonflux> i don't care, i am not mad, i love you.
[15:44:06] <jotham> so i'm sorry
[15:44:29] <jotham> i will argue with you about anything till whenever
[15:44:37] <Carbonflux> :)
[15:44:40] <jotham> but not at the cost of creating a weird environmental spill
[15:45:05] <Carbonflux> anyway, i need sleep, i hope this new year is a good one for us all :)

[15:47:44] <jotham> tomorrow i have a bbq set up
[15:47:50] <jotham> for 3 families and 2 older parentals
[15:47:55] <jotham> i realised last week
[15:48:04] <jotham> that i'm too old to do the new years eve party
[15:48:14] <jotham> i used to like, get fucked on as much mdma and meth as i could
[15:48:21] <jotham> and spend 3 days in a blank state
[15:48:31] <jotham> this year it terrified me, the new years eve thing
[15:48:39] <jotham> but realised we could just have a big fucking new years day bbq
[15:48:44] <jotham> where you can come if you're hung over
[15:48:46] <jotham> or wasted still
[15:48:49] <jotham> or sober
[15:48:53] <jotham> and i'll make sure everyone gets a feed
[15:48:59] <jotham> so spent about $100 on meat
[15:49:04] <jotham> and a girl i'm friends with is doing salads
[15:49:09] <jotham> and other people are bringing things
[15:49:11] <jotham> it's mid summer here
[15:49:15] <jotham> so i think that'll be okay
[15:49:21] <jotham> just gonna drink beer and grill meat all day
[15:49:26] <jotham> and everyones welcome
[15:49:51] <jotham> never hgad that in my last 40 years- new years day social engagement, rather than new years eve desperation to be wasted
[16:12:39] <ERROH> can i come
[16:13:02] <ERROH> did you just call me a cunt
