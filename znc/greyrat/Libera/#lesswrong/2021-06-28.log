[00:01:07] <TJIC> > snow ... solar cells
[00:01:09] <ggreer> I don't think it ever gets above 100mbit, but that's way better than previous options. also the satellites are in LEO so there's no reason why they shouldn't be able to get higher bandwidth rates over time (with more satellites and improved hardware)
[00:01:23] <TJIC> on the bright side, cold increases the efficiency of photovoltaic
[00:01:28] <ggreer> I haven't read the part of your book about solar power yet
[00:01:41] <rmmh> TJIC: isn't the whole "clouds"
[00:01:43] <TJIC> I was starting to put in a PV system this year, here ont he farm, but it got bumped to next year bc reasons :(
[00:01:48] <rmmh> problem kind of countering that
[00:02:09] <ggreer> a cloudy day has less sunlight but not zero sunlight
[00:02:37] <gwern> ggreer: yeah but 100mbit is just not a lot (you'll be lucky to get 10mb/s). and upgrading, well, how long will that take? and will it actually improve your experience or just keep up with user growth?
[00:02:53] <TJIC> re PV and clouds, there's an interesting thing (covered in "Escape the City", of course!) that the statistical amount of cloud cover, plus lattitude, plus all sorts of other things are factored into maps that classify every location by the total typical effective amount of insolation
[00:03:06] <TJIC> scaled to "number of effective full-sunlight-hours-per-day"
[00:03:17] <TJIC> which is an elegant way to  combining a few things
[00:03:29] <gwern> (starlink is not made of money. satellites are big capital. how quickly are they going to replace/upgrade them? especially with competitors?)
[00:03:41] <saturn2> can you put windshield wipers on your solar roof?
[00:03:51] <ggreer> saturn2: most people use a roof rake
[00:04:10] <saturn2> that's not very high tech
[00:04:27] <two2thehead> ggreer, I'm sure that must be relatively automatable
[00:04:46] <ggreer> I was driving through a shitty part of oakland last week and even the homes there had solar cells. solar panels got cheap fast
[00:04:52] <gwern> saturn2: it gets high tech when you try to automate the wipers - just ask tesla owners about the windshield wipers :)
[00:04:56] <TJIC> the interesting thing about Starlink, IMO, is how it creates a customer for SpaceX
[00:04:58] <ggreer> heh
[00:05:05] <saturn2> >:(
[00:05:13] <dbohdan> saturn2: Tesla solar roofs self-clean
[00:05:16] <TJIC> so any time there's an open slot in the launch schedule, throw some more up there
[00:05:25] <saturn2> dbohdan: how?
[00:05:27] <TJIC> which helps drive launches to economies of scale
[00:05:28] <ggreer> gwern: that used to be super annoying but they seem to have finally fixed it in an update this year

[00:09:17] <Robomot> HUS doctor: Infections linked to St. Petersburg travel likely to rise | Yle Uutiset | yle.fi (The number of infections traced back to travel from the Russian city has risen to 140 in Helsinki alone.)
[00:10:13] <kuudes> a couple of days ago some 800 football fans were let into finland from russia without testing because of snafu. and there was now a news where the contact tracing voiced alarm that on that batch people seem to have exposed up to 60 persons per source case
[00:10:25] <kuudes> so this would mean an upper limit of 48000 new infections at once
[00:10:45] <kuudes> I think it is likely we could now still get maybe 10k new infections in a short period of time
[00:10:52] <kuudes> from our current of <100 cases/day

They offered an alternative to the risk and hassle of sterilizing reusable glass syringes.  However, maybe they weren't actually safe?  'A safety test by Kelly and colleagues (2008)[6] found a PCNFI device failed to prevent contamination. After administering injections to hepatitis B patients, researchers found

[01:37:46] <ggreer> he's got the ratios right. it's as if you're breathing 11% oxygen at sea level

[12:26:37] <quanticle> saturn2: Eh, not really
[12:26:45] <quanticle> At least not by analogy to the article
[12:27:04] <quanticle> The article is talking about editors that don't have emacs' extensibility, but do share its command syntax
[12:27:28] <quanticle> Neither Javascript nor Python in any way resemble Lisp's syntax.
[12:28:12] <quanticle> By the logic of the article, Go is Ersatz C
[12:28:31] <shawwwn> hard disagree with quanticle. the syntax isn't the focus of language comparisons. (caveat: I haven't read the article)
[12:28:41] <shawwwn> javascript in particular is much closer to lisp than to its namesake, Java
[12:29:16] <quanticle> And, of course, by *your* logic the real Ersatz Emacs is Visual Studio Code.
[12:29:48] <shawwwn> well, I could simply be a fool. I don't know what ersatz means, for example.
[12:30:07] <shawwwn> but I do know that languages vary in power, and that javascript is much closer to the lisp end of the spectrum than the low end.
[12:30:21] <dbohdan> JavaScript is Self-ish
[12:30:26] <shawwwn> yis.
[12:32:21] <synthmeat> i go by "is array actually a tree in the implementation" these days
[12:36:13] <saturn2> quanticle: they copied the basic semantics and built-in data types but left out the extensibility i.e. homoiconicity and macros
[12:37:19] <quanticle> Yeah, and by that logic, VS Code is definitely an Ersatz Emacs.
[12:37:42] <quanticle> It copies the basic semantics and built-in functions but leaves out the extensibility.
[12:37:55] <quanticle> Extending VSCode is a far more painful process than extending Emacs.
[12:38:45] <quanticle> You can't just write a bunch of code in your init file and get new functions in the editor. No, you have to write an extension, hook into one of the pre-approved extension points, etc etc.
[12:42:22] <saturn2> yep, that makes sense
[12:44:46] <Fusxfaranto> vscode definitely does not imitate emacs
[12:47:35] <lizzie> I agree with shawwwn, and comparing languages based on the aesthetics of their syntax is highly misleading
[12:47:58] <adiabatic> comparing languages by syntax is a trap I fall into
[12:48:03] <adiabatic> and vs code is the best emacs
[12:48:05] <adiabatic> fite me
[12:48:33] <lizzie> though I also disagree with shawwwn because saying languages vary by "power" seems like a very vague proxy for multiple more specific concepts
[12:49:11] <lizzie> I think power could mean lower level operations, higher level operations, or performance
[12:49:33] <adiabatic> or expressiveness. some people love their DSLs something fierce
[12:49:49] <lizzie> yes!  I am a big fan of kotlin which lends itself nicely to DSLs
[12:57:26] <dbohdan> Yeah, the "Blub paradox" is multidimensional
[12:58:27] <dbohdan> What is often missing from discussions about it is the acknowledgment that there are different dimensions of blubbiness
[12:59:13] <quanticle> adiabatic: Spoken like someone who's never used spacemacs
[12:59:15] <quanticle> fite me
[12:59:20] <dbohdan> There is the syntactic metaprogramming dimension (likely the main thing on PG's mind when he coined the term "Blub"), but there is also the capacity for live coding, static correctness checking, etc.
[12:59:23] <quanticle> I have used VSCode extensively too
[12:59:48] <adiabatic> if you need to install a package to get sensible behavior like C-s to save, your editor isn't sensible

[13:10:48] <lizzie> turbo actually seems very well designed and highly usable for a console editor

[13:11:04] <Khoth> Once you've got this thing responding to sigusrs, adding an additional "data plane" that accepts regular input sounds like unnecessary feature bloat. just do everything by sending signals

[13:16:35] <lizzie> to be fair, a TUI is still using the standard input stream
[13:17:10] <adiabatic> quanticle: do you have an opinion on typescript
[13:17:19] <dbohdan> lizzie: What do you use Kotlin for?  I am looking for a fast versatile language with lots of libraries that works for web development, and Kotlin is one of my top candidates.
[13:17:59] <quanticle> adiabatic: I was actually talking to saturn2 about this on another late night. Let me pull up what I said
[13:18:15] <lizzie> the only thing a TUI does that's particularly special is emit console control characters to do things like reposition the cursor
[13:18:28] <dbohdan> I am worried Kotlin's coroutines will be obsolete when Java implements Project Loom
[13:18:54] <lizzie> dbohdan: actually web development is at the top of the list of what I *want* to use kotlin for, but in practice, the main thing I've used it for to any great extent is minecraft mods
[13:19:17] <dbohdan> linear: Heh.  Is it good for that?
[13:19:33] <lizzie> and right now I'm working on a kotlin-multiplatform implemention of backup functionality, to serve as a video-game-independent version of a backup mod I made for minecraft in the past
[13:19:46] <dbohdan> linear: Sorry, I didn't mean you
[13:20:01] <lizzie> it's great for minecraft mods.  It's pretty much great for anything you'd use java for.
[13:20:19] <lizzie> If kotlin had coroutines this long before java had any sensible solution, I have little reason to suspect that once java *does* have a good solution, kotlin won't adapt.
[13:20:32] <lizzie> My guess is that kotlin will just use the more performant implementation when running on a newer jvm or something
[13:21:16] <quanticle> adiabatic: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/quanticle/b77a720ec9ba2aa5ea68bb6086c454b5/raw/28f9c607aae2912f43538d1e1b88cf30e2780c35/gistfile1.txt
[13:21:16] <Robomot> text/plain; charset=utf-8 (915 bytes)
[13:21:23] <lizzie> I think kotlin is a solid choice for web development if you are considering jvm but don't want to go all-in with the scala ecosystem.  The scala ecosystem is also interesting.
[13:21:25] <quanticle> saturn2 is correct, as usual
[13:21:35] <adiabatic> oh, I saw that
[13:21:51] <lizzie> Using any java library from kotlin is always at *least* as clean as using the library from java itself
[13:21:55] <lizzie> (something that cannot be said about scala :P)
[13:22:49] <dbohdan> lizzie: Thanks
[13:22:54] <dbohdan> I am also considering Scala 3
[13:23:13] <dbohdan> And Clojure, too.  With its immutable data, metaprogramming, and no types it is the closest to the wildly unpopular language I use now.
[13:23:25] <dbohdan> (Tcl.)
[13:24:10] <lizzie> ooh, I've touched tcl in the past.  I have a giant bias against untyped languages, but as far as they go, tcl was certainly interesting at least
[13:24:18] <quanticle> Clojure is fun
[13:24:21] <quanticle> I can recommend it
[13:24:41] <dbohdan> Tcl is *profoundly* untyped, more so than normal dynamically typed languages
[13:24:44] <lizzie> hehe I still strongly believe that a type system with parameterized types is a huge boon to code abstraction and reusability

[13:25:45] <quanticle> TBH the only thing to recommend Go's type system is, "It enforces stricter guarantees than C," which isn't saying much at all.
[13:26:34] <dbohdan> For me Go was the worst of both worlds: just typed enough to be constraining
[13:26:43] <dbohdan> Although I probably chose a first project that highlighted its weakness like few others would
[13:26:51] <dbohdan> (A serialization format converter.)
[13:27:05] <lizzie> hah yeah
[13:27:11] <synthmeat> i thought that was prime example where go is the ballz
[13:27:20] <lizzie> I think go has enough going for it to justify its existence, but I also don't feel particularly motivated to learn go
[13:27:23] <dbohdan> *weaknesses, plural
[13:27:37] <lizzie> go's main raison d'etre is "get python programmers to do something a bit better than python programming"

[13:28:41] <lizzie> and reusability in what way?
[13:28:50] <quanticle> No, I don't think Go's raison d'etre is to replace Python.
[13:29:01] <lizzie> that's not what I said
[13:29:02] <quanticle> I think Go's raison d'etre is to replace Java for network services.
[13:29:07] <nshepperd2> as in you can write a thing and use it for multiple purposes

[13:29:24] <nshepperd2> such as: data structures

[13:29:55] <nshepperd2> have you ever tried to use a data structure in go that's not built in?
[13:29:59] <lizzie> quanticle: Go's raison d'etre is to create a language for network services, that can be used by the same teams of programmers who would otherwise be writing python
[13:30:06] <lizzie> I don't think they are sending jvm developers off to learn go :P

[13:30:24] <lizzie> go is designed to look like python and be easy to learn by people who know python
[13:30:27] <quanticle> The one thing that Go has, which Java doesn't, is a good deployment story. Go is statically linked by default, and its designers thought about dependency management when designing the language, so it's very easy to make your CI/CD server package up a Go binary and deploy it to your test and production environments in a fully automated fashion. That's something that Java really doesn't have.
[13:30:39] <dbohdan> lizzie: Yes, I think they've accepted the proposal already.  https://blog.golang.org/generics-proposal
[13:30:40] <Robomot> A Proposal for Adding Generics to Go - The Go Blog (Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.)
[13:30:47] <nshepperd2> your options are either to write it from scratch, or sprinkle the program with (interface{})
[13:30:53] <lizzie> java doesn't need a statically linked binary because you don't have to replace the runtime for every application deployment
[13:31:09] <quanticle> lizzie: Except that the majority of network services at Google prior to Go weren't written in Python. Python was disdained at Google and was relegated to the Youtube ghetto.
[13:31:22] <quanticle> The majority of network services were Java
[13:31:32] <lizzie> but also, if you *did* think java's problem was lacking a statically linked binary deployment of your application, you'd use graalvm which provides exactly that
[13:31:41] <quanticle> And Go was really meant to be a more lightweight Java (or a heavier-weight C, depending on what direction you're coming at it from)

Even though I strongly dislike PHP, I found their strategy to be questionable, especially since they were at a phase when they weren't yet experiencing PHP's limitations. The rewrite really felt like it was the CTO's pet project. So I said
[13:35:02] <quanticle> no. Then, about two years later, they reached out to me again. The old CTO, who I'd interviewed with, was gone and the new CTO was asking about Senior Engineers to lead a transition from Go to Java.
[13:35:04] <quanticle> I lol'd and said no

[13:36:05] <lizzie> I would have a preference for java over go for web dev, but if you just rewrote from php to go, and now you want to rewrite again, you definitely have bigger problems than the choice of language
[13:37:30] <quanticle> lizzie: Actually what I said, was, "When I last interviewed with you, your company was rearchitecting its core product from PHP into Go. Now I see you're rearchitecting from Go into Java. Would you care you explain the reasoning behind having two rather severe rewrites of the codebase in as many years?" And then I never heard back from them directly, and the recruiter I was working with said
[13:37:32] <quanticle> that they'd told him I wouldn't be a good fit when he reached out for further information.
[13:37:46] <lizzie> hahahah
[13:38:01] <lizzie> well they clearly don't want anyone around who would point out bad ideas

[13:39:17] <Gurkenglas> How should I create a math post with an abstraction slider that replaces every mention of category with one of set?
[13:43:08] <quanticle> You'd need to write two sets of content, and then use the slider to toggle between the two
[13:43:56] <lizzie> I've also just been having wacky fun in kotlin because I'm writing kotlin-native code and learning to use the c-interop.  I had to look up instructions for how to do something in C and then make it happen in kotlin instead, and it's actually working!
[13:45:40] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, I'm thinking of an editor that edits these texts in parallel, perhaps webbased so readers can use it over the browser, perhaps involving GPT so the effort might not go up quite as exponentially
[13:45:56] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: I'm thinking you have a slider control that emits events, and then a bunch of content blocks that listen for the slider's events and swap their content accordingly according to the new position of the slider.
[13:46:41] <lizzie> the idea of a web-based text editor *should* be a funny joke, and yet normal people these days actually use a web-browser-based text editor that they think is lightweight
[13:46:42] <Gurkenglas> git might help here, commits being text morphisms, merging to combine different directions to change difficulty
[13:46:53] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: You're reinventing Arbital
[13:47:06] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, indeed, because I just tried using arbital and it sucked
[13:47:36] <Gurkenglas> and the technology doesnt sound so hard so maybe i should just improvise it
[13:47:36] <quanticle> Touchè. Fair enough, my friend.
[13:47:50] <Obormot\Gaia> It's not the tech that's the problem with that concept
[13:47:52] <Obormot\Gaia> It's the content
[13:47:54] *** Joins: adiabatty (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[13:48:01] <Obormot\Gaia> That was always Arbital's problem
[13:48:17] <Obormot\Gaia> It requires someone to write massive amounts of specialized content
[13:48:49] <Obormot\Gaia> And that someone (or those someones) needs to be good at writing explanations of technical things for audiences of various levels of sophistication
[13:49:04] <Gurkenglas> the advantage of arbital over just a single post with sliders is that you might relate the commits in one post to those in another, but gpt can do those parts
[13:49:14] <Obormot\Gaia> You can create all sorts of fancy UX to present this, but if you don't have the content, you have nothing
[13:49:38] <quanticle> lizzie: Well, to be fair, I don't think anyone looks at VSCode and claims it's "lightweight", unless they're talking about VSCode in relation to Atom.
[13:50:08] <Obormot\Gaia> (I strongly suggest reading the Arbital postmortem on LW; it's a fascinating study in obvious failure modes)
[13:50:27] <quanticle> The argument is always, "Yeah, it uses half a gig of RAM, but who cares, we all have 16GB in our machines, right? Right?????"
[13:51:19] <quanticle> "And it has a rich plugin ecosystem that allows me to program in *both* React and Vue. What more could I want?"
[13:51:22] <lizzie> quanticle: that's not the pitch I keep hearing.  Everyone who uses vscode tells me that "IDEs are too heavyweight" for them and they wanted a "barebones" text editor!
[13:51:38] <Obormot\Gaia> Ridiculous
[13:51:46] <Obormot\Gaia> There are tons of bare bones text editors
[13:51:50] <lizzie> and it's just very confusing to me because I don't see an actual case for how intellij idea is more "heavyweight" than vscode
[13:52:03] <quanticle> See, I find that argument disingenuous because... the first thing every VSCode user does is install a shitload of plugins to turn their "lightweight" text editor back into an IDE!
[13:52:06] <lizzie> I mean...  if I turned off all the auto-indexing features that make it start doing work all the time
[13:52:08] *** Quits: adiabatty (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[13:52:11] <lizzie> yeah exactly
[13:52:14] <Obormot\Gaia> There is *literally* a company called Bare Bones Software that makes a text editor
[13:52:20] <lizzie> and if I take intellij, I can *disable* plugins until it turns into just a text editor
[13:52:35] <lizzie> there isn't a real difference between a text editor with plugins and an IDE.
[13:52:45] <Obormot\Gaia> Sure there is
[13:52:48] <Obormot\Gaia> One is cooler
[13:52:57] <lizzie> which one?
[13:53:00] <lizzie> and how do you tell them apart?
[13:53:03] <Obormot\Gaia> VS Code of course
[13:53:07] <lizzie> is it based on the default installation package?
[13:53:15] <Obormot\Gaia> Ain't nobody gonna tweet about how they're coding in IntelliJ
[13:53:18] <lizzie> since intellij comes with all the features by default it's an IDE and bloated?
[13:53:24] <Obormot\Gaia> And if they do, no one will read that tweet
[13:53:29] <quanticle> Eh, measured in terms of perfomance, IntelliJ definitely *feels* more heavyweight than VSCode. VSCode and IntelliJ might use the same amount of resources, but when IntelliJ indexes a large Python or Javascript project, its UI suffers greatly. Input lag spikes through the roof. VSCode doesn't suffer as much from that, comparatively.
[13:53:30] <lizzie> oh yes, twitter use is the premier sign of coolness
[13:53:38] <Obormot\Gaia> Ergo, VS Code is cooler and better
[13:54:14] <lizzie> quanticle: consider just turning off the autoindexing stuff?  it seems to me like intellij lags mainly when it decides to start indexing
[13:54:47] <quanticle> Yeah, but what's the point of using IntelliJ without the autoindexing? I may as well just use VSCode. Or hell, I may as well just use Emacs (which is what I actually do)
[13:54:48] <lizzie> do you have plugins for vscode that provide the functionality that intellij does with indexing, without having a similar performance issue?
[13:55:01] <quanticle> For JS, sure
[13:55:27] <lizzie> I mean...  if you don't care about the static analysis features, then you probably *don't* need to use intellij, but it's still not more heavyweight than vscode at that point
[13:55:34] <lizzie> it's just a different thing
[13:55:43] <quanticle> VSCode has, in my experience, just as good performance with things like "jump to definition" as IntelliJ does for JS projects.
[13:55:53] <lizzie> if all you want is an editor with syntax highlighting, turbo looks great and is clearly the most lightweight thing!
[13:55:58] <Obormot\Gaia> (fwiw, I actually do use a bare bones text editor, or I should say the Bare Bones text editor, i.e. BBEdit, so my view is that VS Code is very lame)
[13:56:14] <lizzie> can vscode rename things and automatically rename references?
[13:56:29] <adiabatic> lizzie: depends on the language, but it does it for JS and probably TS as well
[13:56:36] <adiabatic> er, the language plugins
[13:56:58] <lizzie> well I should try to get used to vscode, in any case...  it seems to be my best option for messing with C#
[13:57:18] <quanticle> Like, I'm not disputing that IntelliJ is best for Java and Kotlin projects. But... if you're not in the Java/JRE ecosystem, I don't see much reason to use IntelliJ, or JetBrains' other IntelliJ-derived IDEs. Certainly when writing Python, I found it far easier to set up VSCode for a Python project, and I didn't notice any deficiencies in jump-to-definition or auto-completion.
[13:57:59] <quanticle> IntelliJ required a bunch of project-specific configuration when I was working on a Django project with multiple apps. VSCode just recognized the project structure out of the box.
[13:58:23] <quanticle> s/IntelliJ/PyCharm/
[13:58:25] <lizzie> When I had to write python for a while, I used pycharm, and it was nice, but mainly because I'm used to jetbrains' IDEs.  If you tell me vscode has the same critical features, I believe you.
[13:59:23] <lizzie> I also didn't have a django project with multiple apps.  And I definitely agree that ide preference is heavily dependent on the language ecosystem you need to interact with.
[14:00:00] <quanticle> Yeah, that's the thing: Microsoft has optimized VSCode *heavily* for Python and Javascript
[14:00:11] <quanticle> And insofar as Python and Javascript are both ascendant these days...
[14:00:17] <quanticle> It was a good bet
[14:00:23] <Gurkenglas> Is there a way to run a program on different versions of a file such that it tries to align the control flow of the different runs with one another, ideally speeding up the set of runs?
[14:00:24] <lizzie> I was trying to complain about the people who claim vscode as being in a somehow importantly different category than idea because it's "not an IDE" and "IDEs are bad"
[14:00:37] <adiabatic> lizzie: I'd think Visual Studio would be best for C#
[14:00:41] <quanticle> Oh, yeah, those people are dumb.
[14:00:46] <dbohdan> lizzie: Flix has a built-in Datalog, which I am pretty excited about.  When I program in Tcl, I've learned to reach for an in-memory SQLite DB sooner rather than latter.  I think it is a useful pattern, but it only works because Tcl is tightly integrated with SQLite.  A built-in Datalog may make this kind of pattern practical in a typed language.  Another thing about Flix is that by design it can't define new classes like Kotlin, Scala, and even 
[14:00:46] <dbohdan> Clojure can.  It intentionally discourages OOP, except for interop.
[14:00:51] <lizzie> visual studio doesn't support linux
[14:01:10] <adiabatic> Oh. Well, yeah, VS Code then, maybe.
[14:01:48] <quanticle> There isn't a bright line between an IDE and an editor. You load an editor with enough plugins and it becomes an IDE. You strip an IDE down by turning off features and it becomes an editor. The question is always, "Is the effort I'm putting into configuring this tool more or less than the effort of just picking up a new tool?"
[14:01:55] <lizzie> dbohdan: using sqlite is a good thing in general.  On a related note, https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight
[14:01:55] <Robomot> GitHub - cashapp/sqldelight: SQLDelight - Generates typesafe Kotlin APIs from SQL (SQLDelight - Generates typesafe Kotlin APIs from SQL - cashapp/sqldelight)
[14:01:59] <Gurkenglas> I'm thinking language-agnostic renaming by running the compiler on the 2^n versions of a directory which result from renaming each of the n matches, then taking the smallest nonempty subset of changes such that the control flow can be aligned.
[14:03:12] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: First, what do you mean by "aligning the control flow" and second, why do you think that would improve performance?
[14:04:41] *** Joins: galambo_ (galambo@user/galambo)
[14:05:04] <quanticle> And thirdly, any operation that involves 2^n of anything is likely to be expensive enough that it'd completely swamp any savings found in subsequent steps.
[14:06:54] *** Quits: galambo (galambo@user/galambo) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[14:07:40] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, i mean that the two runs of the program are the same until they read the, say, renamed token, then they put that token into a register, and then they're both at the same instruction so that's still aligned, so we can continue while keeping in mind that whenever the cpu accesses that register we must keep track of the nondeterminism
[14:08:11] <Gurkenglas> then they read another named token so now we're keeping track of two pieces of nondeterminism (and with 100 of them we wouldn't need exponentially more time yet)
[14:08:11] <quanticle> But why would that be faster? It seems to me like that's a recipe for resource contention
[14:08:49] *** Quits: Robomot (~Robomot@user/robomot) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[14:09:28] <quanticle> Also, "keeping in mind that whenever the CPU accesses that register we must keep track of the nondeterminism" is... pretty hand-wavy
[14:09:32] *** Quits: Obormot\Gaia (~obormot@user/obormot) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[14:09:39] <Gurkenglas> and then the program compares two of those tokens for equality, and now either we must keep track of two branches (better than 2^100) or add extra logic to decide which branches to drop as divergent, such as by saying to always keep those branches still aligned with your reference run
[14:09:56] *** Quits: Obormot\Arcturus (~obormot@user/obormot) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[14:10:23] <quanticle> How are you keeping track of the non-determinism? The CPU is already using all of its registers to run the program. Either we use some registers to keep track of the nondeterminism (and slow program execution) or we store the nondeterminism in memory (and slow program execution)
[14:11:01] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, that part would have to be done by virtual machine, or by changing the assembly to wrap each instruction that might access nondeterministic data
[14:11:20] <Gurkenglas> it would slow program execution but only by a constant factor
[14:11:33] <quanticle> Also, I think you misunderstand my comment about the exponential time. You're talking about pre-generating 2^n copies of a directory. Isn't that going to be pretty ridiculous for any nontrivial n?
[14:11:37] <Khoth> This sounds like a lot more effort than having your editor understand the parse tree
[14:11:41] <quanticle> Heck, even trivial n... like 32
[14:12:15] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, not pregenerating 2^n copies, those are virtual. what you physically have is the n changes
[14:12:32] <dbohdan> lizzie: Starred.  Yeah, SQLite is very useful for a lot of things.  I think it is underappreciated as an alternative to mapping over in-memory data structures.
[14:12:48] <Gurkenglas> Khoth, yes but the tools required to implement this would surely be handy in other situations
[14:13:15] <quanticle> dbohdan: It makes me sad that JSON took off as a format for storing data as well as sending data
[14:13:23] <Khoth> Pregenerated or not, O(2^n) is not viable
[14:13:27] <lizzie> dbohdan: I am trying to read more about Flix, and the language actually looks really cool, but I have to admit I cannot understand what the Datalog is
[14:13:38] <Gurkenglas> Khoth, the entire point is to not take exponential time ...
[14:14:24] <Khoth> Oh, I see
[14:14:28] *** Joins: Robomot (~Robomot@user/robomot)
[14:14:28] *** ChanServ sets mode: +v Robomot
[14:14:39] <quanticle> Also, how does your system handle branches? How does your system handle branches that result in function calls? 
[14:15:05] <quanticle> What happens when you encounter if x: foo()
[14:15:15] <quanticle> And x may or may not be true
[14:15:34] <quanticle> How do you enforce alignment then?
[14:15:40] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, either you drop the branches that disagree with your reference run, or you run both branches for a bit and see if they agree again eventually
[14:15:50] <quanticle> So you've reinvented speculative execution
[14:15:58] <Gurkenglas> no, im using it
[14:16:18] <quanticle> No, you've reimplemented speculative execution in your VM
[14:16:20] <quanticle> But you don't need to
[14:16:24] <quanticle> Because the CPU already does that
[14:16:44] <Khoth> If you run the branches for a bit and see if they agree again eventually, what are "a bit" and "eventually"?
[14:17:15] <Gurkenglas> Khoth, that would be user-defined, I suppose, defaulting to "give up when the combinatorial hydra would eat you"
[14:17:51] <Khoth> I'd rather my symbol rename operation just worked rather than consuming some indefinite period of time then failing
[14:18:51] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, you mean i could use existing speculative execution machinery without having the nondeterministic data in a register yet?
[14:18:58] <dbohdan> lizzie: JSON is okay, IMO.  Not perfect, but less ambiguous than XML.  (No more "should this be an attribute?" questions.)
[14:19:26] <dbohdan> lizzie: Datalog is a kind of Prolog-lite.  I developed a rudimentary understanding of logic programming by playing with SWI-Prolog.  I recommend it.
[14:19:50] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: I mean that the CPU, behind the scenes, is already executing both branches leading out of an if, and then throwing away the results of the branch that wasn't taken (and it's led to SPECTRE and MELTDOWN but that's beside the point)
[14:20:01] <quanticle> And you're reimplementing exactly that in software
[14:20:24] <lizzie> json is perfectly fine for transfer of data, especially over text mediums that should be at least somewhat human-readable.  Using json for in-memory representation would be pretty inexcusable
[14:20:38] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, does it also sometimes realize that both branches are equal before the data is available and forget about having branched?
[14:20:56] <quanticle> What does it mean for "both branches to be equal"?
[14:21:07] <Khoth> I think it's difference enough in purpose and implementation that it doesn't really count as the same thing as what the CPU does
[14:21:37] <Khoth> (Also do CPUs really go along both branches? I thought they just picked one)
[14:21:46] <Gurkenglas> Khoth, only the data changed, or nothing changed, pick one
[14:21:54] <Gurkenglas> uh quanticle not Khoth soz
[14:21:58] <quanticle> You're right. They just pick the one that the branch predictor says is more likely.
[14:22:15] <quanticle> Gurkenglas: But... if the data changed the branches aren't the same
[14:22:30] <Gurkenglas> quanticle, sounds like you already had a notion of equality in mind
[14:22:42] <quanticle> If I have if x: write(3) else: write(5), the two branches are most definitely not the same
[14:23:25] <quanticle> And if I have if x: write(3) else: write(3), then a compiler can *already* determine that the branches do the same thing no matter what and optimize them away.
[14:23:26] <Gurkenglas> if you like we can call the one that's not "equal" "aligned control flow"
[14:25:03] <Gurkenglas> one example of branches that join again is when the parser reads tokens of different lengths. the compiler might then even propagate the difference if all later sourcelocs addresses change as a result
[14:25:28] <quanticle> Instead of arguing about this on IRC, can you like... write this up as a Github Gist or something? I really don't get what you're trying to do or why it might be useful
[14:25:58] <quanticle> Like, you keep talking about "aligned control flows", but you're using those words in nonstandard ways
[14:26:10] <Gurkenglas> what is the standard definition of aligned control flow?
[14:26:16] <quanticle> There isn't one
[14:26:25] <quanticle> "alignment" is something that applies to memory access
[14:26:42] <quanticle> Talking about "aligned control flows" is ????
[14:27:01] <nshepperd2> it sounds like you want an optimizing compiler that can do partial application
[14:27:12] <nshepperd2> if i ignore most of the actual words you said
[14:27:25] <quanticle> nshepperd: Uh... isn't that a JIT?
[14:27:34] <quanticle> Or am I now even more confused
[14:27:35] <nshepperd2> yes, potentially
[14:28:08] <dbohdan> lizzie: My least favorite use of JSON is for user-facing configuration files.  "Comments?  What comments?"  But YAML sucks, too...  I've become pretty convinced that configuration should be code in some non-Turing-complete language, like Safe Tcl, Starlark <https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark>, or Dhall <https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell>.

[14:28:09] <Robomot> GitHub - dhall-lang/dhall-haskell: Maintainable configuration files (Maintainable configuration files. Contribute to dhall-lang/dhall-haskell development by creating an account on GitHub.)
[14:28:29] <Khoth> I think he means the execution of two versions of a program having "basically the same" control flow where "basically the same" is fuzzy and ill-defined
[14:28:37] <nshepperd2> like, you want to take a program, and apply it to a 'partial' file, that is an input which is partially concrete values and partially symbolic
[14:29:19] <quanticle> dbohdan: I disagree. Configuration should be in a turing-complete language because... it turns out that as configuration languages evolve, they *become* Turing Complete, usually in a really shitty accidental way that makes them impossible to debug. YAML is a great example of this, with its include system.
[14:29:31] <nshepperd2> and then do symbolic execution/constant folding (which are two sides of the same coin)
[14:29:46] <quanticle> So it's better to have your config in a language that is *intentionally* Turing Complete, so that you can define correct abstractions
[14:31:42] <Gurkenglas> nshepperd2, nice thanks
[14:32:07] *** Quits: Kol (~Kol@d75-157-122-186.bchsia.telus.net) ()
[14:32:49] <quanticle> Oh... okay, that makes a lot more sense
[14:33:19] <lizzie> dbohdan: I once implemented an overly complicated but not quite turing complete user-facing config of my own for a minecraft mod.  It was probably a bad idea and I don't think many of my target users figured out how to use it, and my syntax probably kind of sucked.  Are there examples of what Dhall looks like?
[14:33:29] <quanticle> But I'm still in the dark about how you avoid combinatorial explosion
[14:34:01] <Gurkenglas> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution#Path_explosion
[14:34:02] <Robomot> Symbolic execution - Wikipedia [Path explosion] (In computer science, symbolic execution (also symbolic evaluation or symbex) is a means of analyzing a program to determine what inputs cause each part of a program to execute. An interpreter follows the program, assuming symbolic values for inputs rather than obtaining actual inputs as normal execution of the program would. …)
[14:35:02] <dbohdan> quanticle: I don't think we disagree.  When I say non-Turing-complete, I just mean "guaranteed to terminate".  For example, sandboxed Tcl does it by allowing the user to set a limit on the total number of interpreter instructions when evaluating code.  You don't need to hamstring the language itself by removing functions or anything like that.
[14:35:02] <quanticle> Okay, so you just restrict the kinds of programs your compiler can handle
[14:35:13] <dbohdan> lizzie: There are examples on https://dhall-lang.org/
[14:35:13] <quanticle> Okay, that's fair
[14:35:13] <Robomot> The Dhall configuration language (Maintainable configuration files)
[14:35:18] <nshepperd2> you could probably do this with like clang or something by just compiling an array into your program representing the input, with some elements constant and others input-dependent. but the result would probably be rubbish since clang's optimizations aren't really made for that
[14:36:08] <quanticle> Yeah, I'm a fan of guaranteed-to-terminate configuration enforced by some kind of static analyzer. BPF is, IMO, a good example of this
[14:36:27] <quanticle> You can do a lot with BPF, but BPF programs are guaranteed to terminate
[14:36:42] <Gurkenglas> "path group" *slaps pySum* it's called category!
[14:38:47] <nshepperd2> one mildly cool feature of Dhall is that the language is strongly normalizing (i think that's the phrase?), which means you can take some horrible complicated config written by your asshole coworker who left, and convert it into an obvious straightforward config with no abstraction
[14:39:26] <quanticle> "Programs interact with their environment by performing system calls, receiving signals, etc. Consistency problems may arise when execution reaches components that are not under control of the symbolic execution tool (e.g., kernel or libraries)." <-- That's basically my objection right there.
[14:40:16] <quanticle> nshepperd2: Is that like gofmt? Or... does it actually rewrite the configuration into some kind of "normal form"?
[14:40:18] <adiabatic> why in the everloving fuck would anyone but a curry-for-brains haskell programmer think that commas as a separator (rather than a terminator) is a good idea for config languages
[14:40:55] <nshepperd2> quanticle: an actual normal form

[14:42:10] <nshepperd2> aren't commas usually separators
[14:42:31] <adiabatic> not in sensible new languages like Go and JS
[14:42:38] <nshepperd2> oh, the comma at the start of the line thing
[14:42:58] <nshepperd2> yeah, that's a poor substitute for just supporting [a, b, c,]
[14:43:00] <feep> when the vortigaunts 1,1get their energy sucked out to contain the g-man, we know they can do that - it's an established tool - because they did it at the start of episode 1.

[19:59:53] <dbohdan> gwern: On the other hand, as beauty becomes increasingly a matter of CGI and AI filters (because biology and makeup alone can't compete), perhaps an entertainer's age will matter less and their careers will be longer.  It will allow for stronger, more frequent comebacks of entertainers who were popular when young.  They will be able to make back some of the money they left on the table due to youth and inexperience.

[22:43:53] <gwern> the problem is, everyone as adults is into rock climbing. I don't want to climb rocks. I want to climb trees! give me indoor tree climbing gyms!

[22:44:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Guys did you know that there are trees outdoors

[22:44:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, some, yeah

[22:44:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Send gwern in first
[22:44:51] <feep> I don't really want trees, I just want tree shaped climbing objects.
[22:45:34] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: I think trees might be even more dangerous than like rocks. at least you can jam spikes into rocks without anyone whining at you etc
[22:46:15] <gwern> anyway, same reasons you want indoor gyms for both. synthetic trees could be a lot safer, more designed and optimized for maximum tree-climbing-ness
[22:46:35] <feep> imagine
[22:46:41] <feep> just ten meters of vertical branchness

[22:47:32] <gwern> 'I could go up that one... but then I'd have to make a jump across the gap... that gap really needs a rope to swing over... but that stump over there lets you jump for the bottom branch...'
[22:47:34] <spxtr> much harder to set new trees though, compared to rearranging holds on a reasonably flat wall
[22:48:23] <gwern> I'm imagining movable tree trunks, essentially 'hanging' off a ceiling grid and locked into place, with socks for arbitrary branches/addons to be inserted
[22:48:26] <feep> yeah

[23:43:22] <kuudes> two2thehead, the downtown/hub is the place most visit. there are lot less downtown area than there are suburb area
[23:43:38] <kuudes> when going to suburb, mostly users are going home, ie they have 1 destination
[23:43:52] <kuudes> they don't frequent random houses that often compared to those destinations
[23:43:58] <kuudes> and public transit is expensive
[23:44:23] <kuudes> there was this kutsuplus thingy in finland, which was a minibus you called with an app
[23:44:32] <kuudes> but taxis disliked it and got it cut off
[23:44:39] <kuudes> .g kutsuplus

[23:44:42] <feepbot> held up as an ideal of publ [snip])
[23:45:11] <two2thehead> kuudes, huh
[23:46:13] <kuudes> basicly the question is again on the "last mile" or just "last 100 m"
[23:47:38] <two2thehead> "“If you have only a few vehicles covering a large region, you’re probably going to have to wait a long time for rides, and you won’t have the overlaps that make shared rides work,” said Winston. “The genius of this whole concept is finding people who are moving in the same direction and then using that to fill open seats.”"
[23:47:44] <kuudes> kutsuplus idea was to bridge that with the app - you ping the system and tell it where you want to go, it files a travel route for you, buys tickets, routes a collection bus to come for you, and tells you where to stand etc
[23:47:55] <two2thehead> So basically finland doesn't have enough people/km to make this work
[23:48:03] <kuudes> well, it has
[23:48:10] <kuudes> but all public transit needs tax moneys
[23:48:25] <kuudes> and then we get into the territory of who is allowed to do what, political support etc
[23:48:31] <two2thehead> okay gotcha
[23:48:39] <feep> ~escooters~
[23:48:41] <kuudes> taxi drivers are key voters for some groups
[23:49:06] <kuudes> well sure, but biwheels usually don't have roof
[23:49:11] <feep> sure
[23:49:14] <kuudes> so you get wet when it rains and you get cold on winters
[23:49:29] <feep> you can hilariously drive an escooter with an umbrella
[23:49:36] <feep> you have to do some contortions with your hips to make it work
[23:50:12] <feep> basically you gotta brace the steering column with your thighs
[23:50:16] <kuudes> I have wondered if london would have high enough of pedestrian density that they could use person conveyor belts
[23:50:34] <kuudes> they have iirc at least one bridge for pedestrians which is unidirectional per time of day
[23:50:50] <kuudes> so maybe it would make sense to make crossing that faster?
[23:51:13] <kuudes> you know, asimovian person conveyor belts as in caves of steel or whatwasit in english
[23:51:41] <kuudes> rentable escooters seem to have a problem that people want them to be illegally fast
[23:52:06] <kuudes> if they are bikes, then one should follow bike traffic rules - but they could also be pedestrians if their speed is capped to 15 km/h
[23:52:14] <kuudes> and pedestrians have very much less rules
[23:52:26] <kuudes> so it would be just like you could run the whole time for free
[23:52:51] <feep> I want my escooter to be illegally fast :(
[23:52:54] <kuudes> and well, traffic should be boring.
[23:53:05] <feep> every time I ride it downhill at 30km/h, I'm like ... "why can my ride to work not be like this"
[23:53:19] <ggreer> can't you mod it?
[23:53:19] <kuudes> well you can go run downhill as well...
[23:53:28] <feep> ggreer: sure but I don't wanna break the law :p
[23:53:32] <kuudes> ggreer, sure, but then you are liable to motorcycle tax
[23:53:41] <kuudes> and have to get it roadworthy checked
[23:53:58] <ggreer> how often do people get caught with modded scooters? also what's the penalty? it's probably just some lame fine

[23:54:57] <ggreer> ok, but what's the probability of being caught? I break laws all the time because I know the chances I'll be caught are ~0
[23:54:59] <feepbot> kuudes: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/06/in-finland-speeding-tickets-are-linked-to-your-income/ In Finland, speeding tickets are linked to your income | World Economic Forum (In Finland, penalties for traffic violations are pegged to taxable income, resulting in some headline-grabbing fines. It’s a model that has also been adopted in other European countries.)
[23:55:17] <kuudes> I know police has busted teens with illegal mopeds constantly
[23:55:30] <ggreer> any sane executive would spend $500k on lawyers to fight the ticket
[23:55:39] <kuudes> often it leads to impounding of said vehicle, which is effective because they cost some thousands
[23:55:46] <kuudes> sure, but what then?
[23:55:51] <kuudes> you still have to pay it
[23:56:01] <kuudes> option in the past was to go to prison for same duration
[23:56:16] <pompolic> the state pursues the case out of taxpayer money, no?
[23:56:58] <ggreer> pompolic: depends. does the prosecutor's organization get a cut? if not then it's other people's money and there's not much incentive to go after it besides publicity
[23:57:21] <kuudes> finland does not have that form of corruption that much
[23:57:35] <kuudes> police indeed also punishes rich people here
[23:57:42] <ggreer> uh huh
[23:57:46] <kuudes> "law is same for everyone" etc
[23:58:20] <ggreer> I heard the same thing from people in china and then I went there and discovered that corruption is pretty rampant

[23:58:38] <pompolic> isn't this disparate impact
[23:58:46] <kuudes> no, it is relative to their income

[23:58:53] <kuudes> the relative impact is equal
[23:59:13] <kuudes> the point is to cause you harm about the same amount than if you were in prison for the duration of the fine
[23:59:26] <kuudes> so 90 day fines is a thing to replace a 3 month prison
[23:59:49] <kuudes> basicly day fines are for sentences smaller than 6 months usually
