[01:13:22] <halosghost> so that doesn't bode well ‚ò∫
[01:14:51] <sgt_chuckles> i hear the best use case of it is within an organization. but also that people don't think enough about the implementation.
[01:15:34] <iz> what would be the advantages of using blockchain voting within an organization over just using a traditional centralized voting system?
[01:16:08] <iz> besides it taking more data and requiring constant mining to secure it
[01:17:50] <sgt_chuckles> blockchain is immutable, and could possibly provide some monetary incentive? you can use proof of stake
[01:17:57] <kashire> iz: because obviously (duh!) it's totally blockchain! ugh, you just don't understand, its blockchain. 
[01:18:13] <iz> hehe
[01:19:00] <sgt_chuckles> it's a bad idea because MIT said so. ok thanks.
[01:19:05] <iz> sgt_chuckles: it's only immutable if you have a huge mining effort securing it..
[01:19:25] <iz> sgt_chuckles: and if you are doing it internal within an organization, you won't have that in a cost effective manner
[01:19:44] <iz> and if you use a public blockchain, you are putting all your organization's data out into the public needlessly
[01:20:13] <sgt_chuckles> is: what does proof of stake change about the immutability?
[01:20:27] <kashire> sgt_chuckles: Fuck MIT.
[01:20:29] <kashire> MIT can blow me.
[01:20:32] <iz> if internal, nothing.. it's meaningless
[01:20:34] <kashire> Don't be a degenerate and an idiot.
[01:20:49] <iz> proof of stake of what?  some internal organization coin that is worthless?
[01:21:05] <iz> and if external, then you are putting all your organization's data out into the public needlessly
[01:21:36] <sgt_chuckles> also, lets say there's a company that provides hr tools and payroll services to other companies with a feature for blockchain voting. couldn't that produce some net effect with the amount of customers?
[01:22:02] <iz> only if those customers were mining, which they wouldn't be, b/c that's a tough sell
[01:23:29] <sgt_chuckles> the feature would be better off without blockchain then
[01:23:41] <iz> yup
[01:24:27] <sgt_chuckles> but the general idea would work if there was enough infrastructure for it.
[01:25:21] <kashire> You are starting with a solution and trying to fit that solution in.

[01:26:40] <sgt_chuckles> i came here to test the idea not sell people on it
[01:26:42] <halosghost> any decentralized consensus mechanism kind of explicitly doesn't make sense when the problem being addressed is centralized

[01:31:55] <Alipha> haven't people been proposing using blockchain for elections? we have the technology to keep your vote private, yet be able to aggregate votes, and to ensure someone doesn't vote twice, right?

[01:44:23] <iz> i'm always blown away by how long vulns existed in widely used software before they are found and patched
[01:44:28] <tykling> my point exactly
[01:44:38] <halosghost> Klotz: I mean‚Ä¶ pre-1936, there were very few bugs in computers
[01:44:43] <tykling> so how can anyone think that elections on computers are a good idea
[01:44:47] <Klotz> and think about those that are NOT found / reported
[01:44:50] <halosghost> (though, there's a kind of obvious reason for that üòõ)
[01:44:55] <kashire> tykling: In fairness though, I also don't trust democracy at all. So, we run into the issue of me defending a system's integrity that I do not believe holds any genuine integrity.
[01:44:55] <Klotz> the ice berg is much bigger
[01:45:24] <tykling> kashire: sure, but democracy is the least shit system we have. it is like that with a lot of things

[01:46:05] <kashire> tykling: I'm not interesting in a political debate, friend. 
[01:46:16] <iz> with specialized hardware, you can get secure stuff though... when they say computer voting, they don't mean (i hope they don't at least) voting on a normal windows machine running a voting program

[01:47:08] <Klotz> kashire: someone might indeed
[01:47:12] <Alipha> kashire: halosghost: with a public blockchain, however, multiple vendors could create interfaces for voting on the blockchain or verifying your vote on the blockchain. So you could easily vote on one system and then use multiple other systems to verify
[01:47:27] <tykling> iz: who would you get to build such hardware? how would you audit the software? how would you make sure the softare you think runs on your special secure hw actually is the version you think?

[02:11:54] <halosghost> here's my final word on this. Either it's done with a decentralized blockchain (in which case you distribute your trust (you don't eliminate it!)) which is an example of using a decentralized consensus mechanism to address a centralized trust problem (effectively unworkable), or it's a centralized blockchain (e.g., run by the government) in which case there's exactly no benefit of a blockchain over a database

[02:12:03] <Alipha> halosghost: what exactly is the attack you're proposing? miners only aggregate transactions. the transactions are signed by the people who create the transactions (ie, the voters). and you can verify that your transaction was correctly processed because the blockchain is public

[13:39:50] <maroon> instead of 1 man 1 vote, it's 1 gpu-rig 1 vote. and no more laws limiting who's a legal voter and who's not
[13:40:37] <caveman> yes, but if government becomes a smart contract on the block chain, it'd be more transparent, and less subject to violating rules.  further, it'd feel as if we have an immortal ``crypto-king'' that doesn't change his word.
[13:42:01] <Deknos> maroon, than buying gpu-rigs will be outlawed :D
[13:42:07] <caveman> crypto-king elections will be by having them propose smart-contract apps.  then, once a crypto-king is elected, his election promises will be executed by the blockchain.  this is very different than current elections, where every promise is broken by the human-king.
[13:42:16] <Deknos> "yes, but if government becomes a smart contract on the block chain, it'd be more transparent, and less subject to violating rules" that's an unproven assumption.
[13:42:31] <maroon> having 100% of everything being transparent can be a bad thing - like the time in the 1930's when one of the state legislatures was discussing 'war plan red' (war against united kingdom), and the text ended up published in the official record
[13:43:48] <caveman> true.  but, technically, i think smart contracts can be encrypted (hidden) and get decrypted only right before the zeroth hour.
[13:44:39] <maroon> is there guarantee that the warren commission report could be hidden, and then 'MUST' be decrypted at the promised date?
[13:44:42] *** Quits: kish` (~aqua@user/aqua) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[13:45:47] <maroon> ends up being a high tech popularity contest, so nothing changes
[13:46:05] <caveman> i think we can guarantee it statistically to be high enough.  e.g. if the contract's decryption key exists in a series of recursively encrypted keys in an onion, so that it's only possible to get the final key if a large-enough majority of nodes choose to simulaneously cheat and decrypt the contract.
[13:46:55] *** Joins: martin02 (~silas@141.84.69.76)
[13:46:56] <maroon> so they could decide to get the key tomorrow, or decide to never release it
[13:47:05] <caveman> for every key decryption that happens before the consensus time, the decryptor who cheated will incur a hefty monetary penalty out of his/her security deposit.
[13:47:26] <maroon> imposed by the people who agree with the decision?
[13:47:27] <caveman> yes.  but then, the consensus will punish everyone who did it before the deadline.
[13:47:45] <caveman> the penalty can be the consensus, just any full node.
[13:47:48] <maroon> what if the consensus decides to punish someone regardless of what they do
[13:47:55] <maroon> so, a popularity contest
[13:48:25] <maroon> popularity contest ruled by those controlling the most gpu rigs
[13:48:50] <caveman> well.  if consensus is wicked, then natural selection will remove them.  which is why we call them `wicked' (thanks to evolution).  this is why, today, consensus is majority good.
[13:49:42] <maroon> there have been plenty of victims of concensus throughout history
[13:49:43] <caveman> if you can't trust the consensus, then you can't trust pentagon/feds/government either.  the consensus is more likely to be good than any smaller group (e.g. government).
[13:50:18] <caveman> yes.  and more victims of governments, specially smaller governments ruled by a fewer people (ultimately just 1 king).
[13:50:25] <maroon> you end up with concensus controlled by taylor swift or howard stern or joe rogan
[13:50:59] <caveman> we already live in the consensus-ruled world.  don't fear-monger about dying when we're dead.
[13:51:16] <maroon> so the bad guys end p controlling concensus by blackmailing the concensus-makers
[13:52:02] <caveman> yes, like lobbying the congress, except it will be much harder to lobby the blockchain consensus, because it has more people.

[13:58:04] <Deknos> this really has left the realm of cryptology/cryptography. here are my views: 1. because most people already not really participate on the blockchain but on platforms which manages stuff for them. 2. people are not lazy but.. overwhelmed. they will always choose representatives which do stuff for them which gives the representatives focused power. and this will then be imaged in the blockchain. and some stuff will be out-regulated like laws which should 
[13:58:05] <Deknos> protect consumers or employees. they will be called to expensive or make things burdenening and the locks and balances in the ledger will be removed/relaxed. 
[13:58:44] <caveman> so, let's elect trust smart knowledgeable people that will do what's just right for us :D
[13:59:24] <Deknos> did you ever see the simpsons episode about that topic?
[14:00:48] <caveman> let me be clear:  blockchain will bring its own law-enforcement.  it's already happening.  soon applying 'law' will be a matter of a smart contract.  which law?  blockchain's law agreed by consensus.
[14:01:16] <MacGyver> Yeah and that's not a world I want to live in.
[14:01:20] <MacGyver> As I've stated more than once.
[14:01:29] <maroon> one great restraint is to require that the lawmakers not be able to make themselves exempt from laws they pass - so if they pass legislation so people can't own guns, then they shouldn't have armed security for themselves or their family either

[14:28:04] <neiluj> :D
[14:28:34] <Deknos> quadratic sieves are ontopic, ask away
[14:29:48] <MacGyver> Unless the question is how to compute it in a smart contract.
[14:31:45] <neiluj> yeah so: We want to factor n. When sieving the method is to find the highest power of a prime p in the factor base such that Q(x)=x^2-n=0 mod p^beta has solutions in the sieving interval S={Q(x)}_x (by lifting solutions to higher powers of p). But it sounds that this isn't necessary: for each Q(x) we know which x is associated to it; thus no need to find a quadratic residue: just compute Q(x) mod
[14:31:47] <neiluj> p^beta until we get 0
[14:38:20] <neiluj> The original sieving algorithm iterates over the primes in the factor base (thus they need to solve quadratic residues); my idea is to iterate over the primes + the set of {x^2-n}_x.
[14:39:06] <neiluj> Huh no
[14:40:06] <neiluj> I guess the best way to check if my method holds is to code it and check if I get some B-smooth numbers at the end.
[14:41:53] <neiluj> no no, "The original sieving algorithm iterates over the primes in the factor base" is correct

[16:44:17] <joe7057> exactly. Whereas in the more distant past it was more common for individuals to operate their own bulletin boards, irc servers, etc. But now everything is centralized, and even more so since most of these services are hosted on AWS.
[16:45:20] <Deknos> i don't know... i use the internet since 99, and there were never that much people who really run an irc or chatservice... (regarding selfhosted stuff) but yeah the centralization is a threat.
[16:47:37] <joe7057> I'm talking in the early days. Like the 80s. Though I suppose it wasn't really "the internet" at that point.
[16:48:29] <Deknos> the internet in its classical inter-net, loosely coupled networks style :D
[16:49:02] <joe7057> yep.
[16:49:31] <joe7057> I much prefer the decentralized model, where everyone is their own web host.
[16:50:48] <maroon> the even older model did have its advantages. you could learn proper spelling and grammar by just reading a lot. but now everyone posts without an editor, and the spelling and grammar you learn is horrible
[16:58:46] <joe7057> True, but you can still learn by reading. And I think that it is the responsibility of parents to make sure their kids are reading books to develop their literature skills.
[17:00:16] <joe7057> And you can still read stuff written well online, if you go to news sites. The problem is that for some reason our society still expects us to go to the mainstream legacy media sources, rather than looking to independant, online journalists, who are often closer to true journalism than those mainstream sources (who often write entire stories based on nothing but social media posts and trends)
[17:00:21] *** Quits: rustycl0ck (~ircuser@gateway/tor-sasl/rustycl0ck) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[17:00:37] <Deknos> .. and sometimes grammar nazis are to hellbent on grammatics. language is for communication and all living languages change all the time. but yeah, often spelling and grammar is terrible.. and again offtopic :D
[17:02:17] <maroon> it was just an example of why centralization is here to stay, as it does have some side-benefits
[17:03:34] <joe7057> yeah grammar is definitely offtopic. I suppose I should mention that where I was going was that cryptography is an important component of working back towards the idea of the internet as a place where people can say what they think without fear of censorship, by letting them share their opinions without revealing their identity. One example of such a system is the tor network.
[17:04:17] <joe7057> The main issue as I see it is actually having people use such a system rather than it existing with an eternal image of being "that thing criminals use".
[17:04:55] <joe7057> Of course there are other issues as well, such as how to deal with spam if everyone is truly anonymous. 
[17:06:03] <iz> tor network is just for the CIA to be like "idk man, that wasn't us, i guess it was.. random hackers" ;b
[17:07:10] <joe7057> iz: exactly. But anyone can use the tech for the same purpose, specifically because it is the amount of traffic that makes individuals hidden.
[17:07:23] <maroon> you'd think after centuries of crypto they can make stuff that can't hacked, but in star trek they still have 'yeah the romulans have already cracked that code'
[17:07:29] <joe7057> Either way, I was using it as an example of such a system, not to suggest it is the correct system
[17:07:42] <iz> yeah, and you are right on about the difficulty in balancing anonimity with sane controls
[17:08:11] <joe7057> maroon: well yeah, that's BS. The only way that would be true is if they were referring to their spies having sent them the cryptographic key.
[17:08:22] <joe7057> iz: yep. Bloody annoying problem. 
[17:08:39] <iz> the bane of everyone who makes cryptographically anonymous messaging is that it eventually gets used for undefendably bad things
[17:09:11] <iz> it's all fun and games until your stuff starts getting used for child porn and sex trafficing
[17:09:17] <joe7057> iz: of course. That comment was made even by one of the first people =involved in disseminating public key cryptography.
[17:09:48] <joe7057> But of course the reality is that any technology can be used for both good and evil. And of course for crypto the good far outweighs the evil. 
[17:10:26] <joe7057> I think we really need to stop the societal tendency to automatically blame the creator of something when that thing is used for evil, even if they could do
[17:10:31] <joe7057> nothing to prevent that evil.
[17:10:35] <maroon> back in the 90s i had published an encryption program on usenet, and suddenly someone was spreading it around as a useful tool for keeping/distributing scientology stuff they wanted kept secret. leave me out of this!
[17:10:37] <iz> i think it's like.. those ratios aren't evenly consistent over the area of the world
[17:11:03] <maroon> blame god for creating satan
[17:11:10] <iz> there are certain places where the potential for good certainly outweighs the bad.. places w/ heavy authoratarian controls, etc
[17:11:33] <joe7057> maroon: sure. But the thing to remember is that they would have found some other system. They just happened to find yours. 
[17:11:42] <maroon> unless the controls are needed to prevent the spread of the zombie apocolypse
[17:12:01] <iz> but other places where the potential for bad is greater than the potential for good.. places where the good uses of crypto aren't that outstandingly different and the hinderence to law enforcement can cause much more bad
[17:12:05] <aczid> so sad for him that caveman is not here to read all this interesting and still very off topic chat
[17:12:23] <joe7057> iz: even in "free" countries. Remember that it is cryptography that enables everyone to have secure connections to websites, purchase things online, keep their passwords private, ...]
[17:12:48] <iz> i've been trying to explain to caveman for months that he doesn't quite understand the double spending problem and it's the root of most of his misunderstandings and misconceptions
[17:13:22] <joe7057> aczid: Okay then, can you explain why it is off topic? We seem to be discussing cryptography in practice. But perhaps I am wrong about that.
[17:13:27] <iz> joe7057: well, i don't mean cryptography in general, but i'm talking about some sort of totally anonymous cryptographic messaging system
[17:14:38] <aczid> joe7057: I thought it's pretty philosophical and non technical, maybe I'm mistaken on what actually is on or off topic though
[17:15:23] <joe7057> iz: the reality is such a thing already exists for criminals. Look at the app onionshare, which lets you easily create a private chatroom, with which criminals can create a communicaitons channel that is private to them. The issue is not whether it is available to criminals, because it already is. But how could a mainstream method be created that people would actually use, and that would not be
[17:15:25] <joe7057> just filled with spam.

[17:17:05] <iz> usually the chat is more technical, yeah, but i think this is still on-topic philisophical, as long as it doesn't just get into political debates about what is and isn't censorship or whatever other tangents it could easily veer off into
[17:17:37] <joe7057> aczid: I guess I was commenting on the application to such a philosophy. But I was also answering questions which were more about the philosophy than the application. I'll try to keep it to cryptography in future. 
[17:17:43] <iz> such a thing = anon crypto messaging type apps

[17:18:33] <iz> hehe yeah
[17:18:39] <joe7057> sshine: "A totally anonymous cryptographic messaging system"
[17:19:06] <maroon> created by Mallory and Eve
[17:19:46] <iz> it really does just boil down to that trade off between totally anon and the ability to have sane controls
[17:20:07] <joe7057> iz: true. It is an interesting problem to look at. 
[17:20:13] * iz nods
[17:21:26] <maroon> sane controls by parents are appropriate - and spamming is childish behavior, so fair game on them
[17:28:28] <joe7057> The real problem seems to be how do we let people be anonymous, while also somehow preventing individual people from just creating a ton of accounts to spam.
[17:29:10] <joe7057> Basically there needs to be some cost to creating an account, that is basically nothing to someone who just creates one or two accounts, but will be a lot so someone who tries to make a ton of accounts.
[17:30:28] <maroon> maybe some kind of account maintenance that requires a fixed amount of time, that's easy for the guy with 1 account, but would be really hard to perform on all the sock puppets
[17:31:57] <joe7057> yeah but how do you prevent them just running it all at the same time. I suppose some sort of cryptographic proof-of-work would be necessary for that.
[17:32:23] <maroon> or accounts cost $1 million, but everyone gets 1-2 free tokens
[17:34:32] <joe7057> true. But to use a token they have to be uniquely identifiable, which breaks the anonymity. E.g. the token is stored as a keypair. But the issuer could keep a record of who was given which keypairs, and then tie them back to the account. So it becomes anonymity by policy, rather than anonymity by design.
[17:35:07] <joe7057> Also $1 million would be unnecessary, even $100 would be fine, since a serial spammer would constantly be getting accounts banned. 
[17:35:49] <joe7057> It has to be something as anonymous as "I don't know who you are, but if you can solve this complex math problem, then you can have 1 account".
[17:36:38] <joe7057> Or something similar that doesn't require the service to actually know who  is signing up, or how many previous accounts they have had (or even how many accounts they have at the moment)

[17:52:21] <joe7057> maroon: actually, now that I think about it, you could sell accounts anonymously if you could get them in stores with case. So buy something similar to a yubikey that encodes a cryptographic key. That would probably work, as long as the service owner is trusted enough to not ban people for stupid reasons. 
[17:54:41] <maroon> maybe if there's a sufficient punishment for engaging in zuckerberg or dorsey style of behavior
[17:56:48] <joe7057> the reality is that cryptography has solved pretty much all of these problems. But how do you apply it in such a way that people will actually use it.
[17:58:29] <joe7057> Email is actually a pretty good example IMO, since it has decent spam filtering, and is still easy to use by a large number of people. And it is not totally centralized, since it is designed for multiple separate email servers to interoperate. So how can we take that idea and apply cryptography to it to enable private, anonymous communications.

[17:59:05] <joe7057> @maroon
[18:00:02] <maroon> decent? it depends on whether you'd rather have false positives or false negatives
[18:00:12] <Deknos> i still wait for a automated privacy friendly crypto-email-person-directory
[18:00:51] <maroon> like how there are numerous services who routinely hide emails from the old freenode and now the libera when people are registering nicks
[18:00:58] <Deknos> like person X has emailadress y and when you got that email with that service your mail there will be ham and not spam and spammers will be automatically technically destroyed/backpressured.
[18:01:00] <joe7057> maroon: I like the way that it works because it places the spam into a separate folder, and the user can modify the filter behaviour by marking certain things as spam
[18:01:42] <maroon> it works so far, until you enter gmail's limit to how many rules you're permitted :(
[18:01:49] <joe7057> Deknos I think that that is sort of what the PGP web of trust is supposed to be. The annoyance there is that it requires a lot of manual work
[18:02:28] <joe7057> maroon: a truly private system would require client-side filtering, not server-side, so the number of rules could be effectively unlimited
[18:02:31] <maroon> and like when you get spammers on your phone, blocking the number just means you block some innocent person whose number is put on the calls
[18:03:32] <Deknos> joe7057, yeah but WoT is attackable AND automated WoT is spammable :(
[18:03:44] <maroon> that could be fixed if there was a class action lawsuit because they claim that caller-id is called "ID" when it's not
[18:04:10] <joe7057> Deknos: so perhaps there could be a similar system, but where signing someone else's account is a way of saying "I certify that this is a real account and not a spammer", rather than saying "I certify that this key belongs to the person it says it does", since tying accounts to a real identity is not intended.
[18:05:55] <joe7057> maroon: in this case spoofing would not be possible, since everything would be verified using cryptography. So if a message were sent the client could automatically check the signature, and clear out inauthentic messages automatically.
[18:06:29] <joe7057> maroon: I am sure that caller-ID is defined sufficiently to prevent that in the contract you sign with a company.
[18:06:50] <maroon> how can you certify someone's not a spammer?
[18:07:18] <joe7057> Deknos: which brings us back to the requirement to somehow make it infeasible for a spammer to constantly create new accounts.
[18:08:54] <maroon> some sites limit a lot of that by not letting someone post until the account has existed for 72 hrs
[18:09:01] <joe7057> maroon: so you know how the PGP web of trust works, right? Have a similar system where each account has an associated keypair, and individual users can sign other user's public keys to say "this account is not a spammer". It could even be a part of a client's interface. E.g. "You have send X email responses to this person. Would you like to certify that they are a legitimate account, and not a
[18:09:04] <joe7057> spammer".
[18:09:10] <maroon> just like a waiting period for buying a gun
[18:09:33] <maroon> no, i mean how can you certify they don't spam
[18:10:05] <joe7057> maroon: indeed. But there has to be some actual cost to that waiting period, to prevent a spammer from just creating 100 accounts all at once and then having 100 free to post 72 hours later.
[18:10:56] <joe7057> maroon: because the individual user is having a real conversation with them. So I suppose it would be more like "I certify that I have had real conversations with this person, and they have not sent me spam".
[18:11:35] <joe7057> Remember that there are patterns to a spammer's account. It will generally send a massive volume of messages to many, many different people, very few if any of whom will actually reply. 
[18:11:58] <Deknos> joe7057, not necessarily, but quite likely
[18:12:17] <joe7057> The server can still see which accounts are communicating, but it can't see what they are saying, and it doesn't know who the people behind the accounts are.
[18:12:19] <maroon> i know the web of trust had ways for people to revoke their own key, can you also revoke your trustiness if the person turns out to be a spammer?
[18:13:22] <joe7057> maroon: sure. Maybe have a way to also sign the message that "I received spam from this person". 
[18:13:45] <joe7057> The important thing is that it is understood that all your signature would mean is that you have had conversation with this person that was not spam in nature. 
[18:14:49] <joe7057> It would be the volume of these certifications (e.g. of the 20 different people you communicate, perhaps 15 of them certify you, and none label you as a spammer), combined with traffic patterns that match a real user rather than a spammer.
[18:14:49] <maroon> some systems of trust are built around the model where there aren't any 'take backs', because that prevents vendors from strongarming customers into deleting their bad reviews
[18:16:51] <joe7057> maroon: true. There does need to be some protection from that. But something to remember is that encrypted messages only remain so as long as both parties wish them to. So if I am threatened by a vendor who has an account on this service, I can choose to reveal that message to the service, which could them potentially ban the account if it is warranted. Now that vendor has lost their account, and
[18:16:54] <joe7057> has to start from scratch, including contacting customers, etc.

[18:36:46] <joe7057> has the desired effect of imparting a cost to them for getting a usable account (which will soon be banned if they start actually spamming with it), but there needs to be a way for trust to be revoked if something such as this causes the account to change from legitimate to a spammer.

[19:08:49] <joe7057> oh interesting. Has it actually been implemented somewhere?
[19:09:04] <joe7057> well, that sounds like exactly what I was thinking
[19:09:10] <halosghost> for regular humans, it's completely unnoticeable; for a spammer, it'd be prohibitive
[19:09:22] <halosghost> hashcash was originally designed specifically for email
[19:09:34] <halosghost> not sure if they implemented a server/client which does it
[19:09:48] <halosghost> but I deeply wish it had caught on
[19:09:57] <TimMc> But with hashcash, you always have to "spend".
[19:10:05] <iz> yeah, it was a good idea and sounds basically exactly like what you guys were discussing

[19:11:15] <iz> yeah, i guess they could just waive the checking of PoW
[19:11:25] <joe7057> it seems to me that the main problem with just tacking it on to email is that email is an old protocol, and so you have to support all of the old servers that don't implement it. Same issue with end-to-end encryption. Services like protonmail implement decent encryption, but can't force outside services to work with it. So both users have to have protonmail accounts for it to be useful.

[19:12:00] <halosghost> but god I wish
[19:12:18] <joe7057> Yeah. Or even say that you have to solve fewer or easier problems if your account is signed by many others as attestation that they have had real conversations with you. 
[19:12:36] <joe7057> halosghost: yep, definitely. It has to have a real benefit.
[19:12:53] <halosghost> TimMc: you could even do something like a 3-way handshake to establish a bypass to hashcash (so that you as the sender now know you don't need to even perform the Work if sending to that person)
[19:13:10] <TimMc> That's bad for async communication, though.
[19:13:18] <joe7057> halosghost: though it could be offered first to those who actually want anonymous, private communication, and just be available for that. Doesn't have to be the standard.
[19:13:27] <halosghost> TimMc: but it'd be one-time
[19:13:34] <TimMc> hmm
[19:13:43] <halosghost> TimMc: (the 3-way handshake puts sender and recipient (both directions) on each others' whitelists)

[19:15:12] <joe7057> halosghost TimMc well if you have a key tied to each account, then you can simply provide the server with an attestation from the recipient that they trust this account, and that should be sufficient to prove that. Perhaps add a time limit on these signatures (e.g. must be re-issued every week) to enable a way of revoking this permission.

[19:24:50] <halosghost> additionally, hashcash has the benefit that verification of work is easy, generation of work is hard
[19:25:22] <halosghost> so, you'd actually really want that 3-way handshake (so that Alice would be able to send to Bob without having to do the work at all)
[19:25:44] <halosghost> (i.e., allowing Bob to skip verification for a trusted Alice is of minimal benefit)
[19:25:49] <joe7057> yep. I don't know the specifics behind how hashcash itself works, but I would think that you could just crack a hashed and salted password of known length.
[19:25:55] <TimMc> and simplicity, of course
[19:26:10] <TimMc> and you can't use the payment to pay for anything else, which is actually really important
[19:26:23] <TimMc> (There's no benefit in farming incoming emails.)

[19:27:19] <halosghost> http://www.hashcash.org/mail/
[19:27:22] <halosghost> it has been implemented!
[19:27:43] <joe7057> halosghost TimMc I would think that you could more easily bypass the PoW requirement for known parties by having a rule that you can send emails encrypted to a specific public key, if you provide a signed verification from the recipient's private key that they trust the owner of that account.
[19:28:11] <halosghost> joe7057: that's interesting
[19:29:01] <TimMc> Would that require signing the message?
[19:29:25] <iz> sounds more like a cryptographic auth allow-list

[19:30:06] <halosghost> even already packaged
[19:30:06] <joe7057> So if I know you, I can send you a signed message saying "I trust this person". Your client stores that message, and the next time it sends an email to me, it also sends along that signed message. The server verifies the signature and then sends the message along without requiring PoW.
[19:30:42] <TimMc> If an attacker got that message, couldn't they attach it to their own messages?
[19:30:50] <euouae> Is this a spam filter with a payment threshold?
[19:31:00] <halosghost> euouae: kind of
[19:31:02] <joe7057> Since my account is tied to my public key, the server will know if the recipient requested matches the public key that signed the authorization.
[19:31:14] <euouae> y'all this will make the spammers very angry
[19:31:38] <joe7057> TimMc obviously the signed authentication message would then be encrypted with your public key before I send it to you, so only you can open it.
[19:31:41] <halosghost> euouae: one can only hope
[19:32:24] <halosghost> joe7057: s/only you/only someone with access to your private key/
[19:33:04] <joe7057> It could even have the authentication message be "I trust this person until X date and time". Then you have to send another authentication (and this could be automated in the client software, so a new verification is automatically sent, say every .5 trust periods, unless I specifically tell my client that I no longer trust this person)
[19:33:25] <halosghost> joe7057: are you familiar with Signal's forward secrecy mechanisms?
[19:33:29] <joe7057> halosghost yes, that is the cryptographic basis of all of this.

[19:34:28] <halosghost> right
[19:34:50] <halosghost> it sounds like you're headed in that direction
[19:35:17] <joe7057> But signal is probably a good example of this. The main issue I see with it is that (1) it requires a phone number, so not anonymous, and (2) it is a closed system, so does not allow anyone to spin up a signal server and communicate with people on other servers. 
[19:35:19] <halosghost> (though, rather than using it for protection of the message, you're headed in the direction of using it to maintain a whitelist)

[19:38:48] <joe7057> I like to think of everything as if it were connected to over something like TOR, where there is no way for the server to know who or where the user is (and vice versa).

[19:41:37] <joe7057> So for example, protonmail allows signup over tor, but they require a phone number to make sure people do not create a ton of accounts over tor for spam. They say they only store a non-reversible hash of this, but we have to trust that this is true. That is anonymity by policy, not by design.

Whereas a true client program is only updated when the user chooses to do so, and
[19:47:20] <joe7057> should be open-source and audited. It could even interface with another, separate, program such as gpg for encryption, so that the client developers are not even the ones doing the encryption, but instead an unconnected third party (that should also be trusted encryption software, but has no interests in the messaging client).

[19:49:07] <joe7057> euouae there is also the question of can a 10-digit phone number be securely hashed? Even with a salt, that is only about 10 billion possible combinations, so you could probably crack the hash with a bit of time on a powerful CPU.
[19:49:22] <euouae> oh yeah it can
[19:49:27] <joe7057> Which would make de-anonymizing individual accounts easier.

[19:50:12] <joe7057> So we would have to also trust that protonmail is only storing how many accounts a certain hash has created, and not which specific accounts they were. Again, anonymity by policy, not by design.
[19:50:21] <euouae> My understanding is that that's one of the features of a key generation like Argon2
[19:50:40] <euouae> To me, I don't understand the silliness of sending a hash of your # number. How is that accomplishing anything?
[19:50:49] <joe7057> except then every time an end user wants to authenticate, it takes an hour
[19:51:50] <joe7057> euoane the idea is that it prevents a single phone number from creating tons of accounts. It is a way of limiting spam. Protonmail unfortunately has to do this somehow because they interface with other mail providers, and if they become known as a source of spam, their entire domain will just be blocked by big mail providers. 
[19:51:51] <euouae> just send an arbitrary hash and be done with it
[19:52:52] <joe7057> oh shoot, I just realized that they must be receiving the actual number, because they text a verification code. So nevermind the client-side hashing, it is definitely anonymity by policy.

[20:01:37] <joe7057> Lets say I register the account anon1@protonmail.com
[20:01:41] <euouae> No I think it's fair to assume that the texting company cannot
[20:01:45] <joe7057> And I give them my phone number 555-0000
[20:01:55] <euouae> and should not
[20:02:13] <joe7057> Protonmail says that they want a verification code, and on the backend they decide that that code is 555555
[20:02:39] <joe7057> They then go to the texting company and say "please send the message '555555' to the phone number '555-0000'".
[20:03:25] <joe7057> Then I get the message, and input the code "555555" into protonmail. They see this, see that I submitted it for the account "anon1@protonmail.com", and verify it because it matches the verification code they generated
[20:03:46] <joe7057> but at no point does the texting company know that this message was related to the email account "anon1@protonmail.com". 
[20:04:00] <euouae> I don't disagree joe7057, the one who could tie your identity to your account would be presumably someone that has access to both protonmail and the sms company
[20:04:15] <joe7057> therefore, while they know that the owner of my phone number has a protonmail account, they don't know which account.

[20:12:47] <joe7057> and the original system was loosely based on the idea of email, but only because I used the email protocol as an example of how it could be decentralized. It is applicable to a secure version of email or of messaging.
[20:17:45] <joe7057> @sshine
[20:21:01] <sshine> joe7057, did you look at the SimpleX messaging system? besides it not being peer-reviewed yet, it looks pretty well-made: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat
[20:21:32] <sshine> joe7057, they offload address book management.

[20:23:25] <joe7057> sshine I have not heard of that one. What do you mean by "offload address book management"?
[20:24:12] <sshine> joe7057, the excuse Signal has to ask for people's phone number is "otherwise, how would people find each other?"
[20:24:24] <sshine> joe7057, SimpleX do not try to solve that problem.
[20:24:47] <sshine> joe7057, they say: we assume you know how to send a link to someone securely.
[20:25:45] <sshine> joe7057, besides; how do you know that someone on Signal is who they say? if you meet up, you can verify the hardware with QR codes, but often we settle for "person X'es key has changed" as a small disturbance in the force.
[20:26:15] <joe7057> sshine That is basically how the system would work. Everyone chooses whatever username they want, and they have a keypair associated with that account to prove who they are doesn't change.
[20:26:21] <sshine> joe7057, "the system"?
[20:26:41] <joe7057> the one we discussed above
[20:26:46] <sshine> I didn't discuss. :)
[20:26:47] <halosghost> joe7057: you'll need key rotation
[20:26:58] <halosghost> so many folk seem to forget key rotation
[20:27:13] <sshine> joe7057, you've been writing quite long sentences for several hours. I can't participate at this rate.
[20:27:48] <sshine> joe7057, anyway, if you're designing a secure messaging protocol / implementation, good luck! it's an interesting space full of pitfalls. I'm happy I don't need to roll my own.
[20:28:18] <sshine> did OTR / Off-The-Record fall out of fashion? https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/
[20:28:35] <joe7057> sshine apologies. I was just theorizing at this point, but it is certainly an interesting problem. 
[20:28:47] <joe7057> Perhaps such a system already exists, and I am just not aware of it. 
[20:28:57] <kashire> otr is still used, at least by my circle. Although, a few have become a big fan of OMEMO.
[20:29:01] <sshine> joe7057, I suppose that's part of coming here to converse, to figure out if systems exist with those properties.
[20:29:11] <joe7057> sshine definitely.
[20:29:28] <joe7057> plus it can be fun to bounce ideas off one another
[20:30:06] <sshine> kashire, OMEMO is an XMPP extension that allows for multiple recipients, i.e. group chats?
[20:30:49] <Deknos> i still wait for burmester-desmedt protocol over xmpp :D
[20:31:25] <sshine> I tried to set up XMPP some 3+ years ago, and I failed. my general opinion is that if I fail to set up software, I can't recommend it. the whole experience was kinda mediocre. but I did try to copy the setup of one person who was quite happy with the old-fashioned-ness of it.

[21:33:04] <Alipha> euouae: there's no reasonable way to hash phone numbers. the possible phone number space is too small. argon2 is not a solution. even if you configure argon2 to take 1 hour to hash a phone number on your computer, an attacker can spin up 3600 cores and hash a phone number in 1 second (well, really, hash 3600 phone numbers in 1 hour, but that has the same throughput). if an attacker has 3,600,000 cores
[21:33:06] <Alipha> available, they can now hash the entire US phone number space (###-###-####) in a few months
[21:36:06] <euouae> Well maybe it should take 1 year to hash then
[21:36:07] <euouae> :D
[21:36:31] <MacGyver> To be fair, a mandatory 1 year delay on actually messaging someone might improve society *significantly*.
[21:37:35] <euouae> I agree with you Alipha, I haven't even thought about the address space of phone numbers in those terms before!

[21:50:49] <joe7057> Alipa something like that. Because if you sign up over tor, you have to provide a phone number, which they use to prevent multiple accounts with the same phone number. Therefore they must store the phone number or a hash thereof

[23:48:39] <TimMc> Agreed. Just thinking about "why anonymity".
[23:50:57] <sshine> TimMc, I think 'middle ground' is a good way to put it. most practical applications live somewhere in the middle where your real conversations have a high degree of confidentiality and privacy, and no assumption of anonymity; anonymity is incredibly hard to work with, because most of us pretend to be someone, and acting truly anonymously is kind of inhumane.
[23:52:22] <euouae> So anonomity would be what you need for whistleblowing purposes, right?

[23:53:08] <sshine> typically anonymity has the sole purpose of avoiding oppression for expressing something that an individual would otherwise be punished for. journalism, political activism, expressing forbidden identity, etc.
[23:53:24] <euouae> you don't need to figure out a way to provide anonymous access to twitter.com but you can figure out a way to provide anonymous transmission of a video file that /holds until the person is safe/
[23:54:13] <euouae> and then it doesn't need to be anonymous to everyone, just the ones that would be trying to hurt the whistleblower 
[23:54:33] <sshine> most people don't need anonymity, but if our technology supports it, we can liberate individuals from types of oppression. I suppose that's why I'd encourage anonymity-supporting technology even though I mostly just want privacy. you never know when you need the other, and anonymity can only exist by obfuscating in a crowd.
