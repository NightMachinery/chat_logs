[10:41:21] <re101-mau-24> hello
[10:41:40] <re101-mau-24> can we remove duplicacy from the given string
[10:42:45] <Me-me> Depends on the scope of the redundancy and the flavour of regex you're using.
[10:43:04] <re101-mau-24> https://regex101.com/r/6v2FuW/1
[10:43:18] <re101-mau-24> like this is the input string
[10:43:33] <Me-me> digitok I believe this was your client.
[10:43:36] <re101-mau-24> we need to remove the repeated text here from this
[10:44:15] <digitok> nope, my clients say thanks
[10:44:18] <digitok> must be yours
[10:44:33] <Me-me> I have a catchphrase based around my clients saying thanks.
[10:45:02] <digitok> you always have one for when they don't
[10:45:07] <digitok> also*
[10:45:24] <Me-me> I don't know of any such phrase.
[10:45:36] <digitok> hap2hlp
[10:45:46] <Me-me> Pff. That's just a joke.
[10:45:53] <digitok> :)
[10:46:05] <Me-me> Anyway I mostly use that one when they say thanks and then leave before I can use my catchphrase.
[10:46:27] <digitok> i'm excited to see what happens this time
[10:46:40] <re101-mau-24> lol, i missed to greet/appreciate with thanks digitok, apologies
[10:46:48] <Me-me> There ya go.
[10:46:58] <re101-mau-24> btw thanks for the prevoius answer, that worked well.

[10:49:01] <re101-mau-24> the string here is the address, i am automating one pdf with ocr engine
[10:49:35] <re101-mau-24> so i want the single address, adress is twice here - one is shipping and ither is billing address
[10:49:51] <re101-mau-24> so dulpicate text have been extracted while reading the pdf

[11:09:53] <Me-me> What needs fixing?
[11:10:25] <re101-mau-24> https://regex101.com/r/hMqonp/1
[11:10:40] <Me-me> In what way does it need fixing?
[11:10:48] <re101-mau-24> we have this input string in which we want to remove redundancy
[11:10:54] <re101-mau-24> but the problem here is
[11:11:31] <re101-mau-24> in the redundancy, it is including the bank name as well along with the address
[11:11:35] <re101-mau-24> if you see
[11:11:55] <Me-me> Why do you put code in the regular expression box?
[11:12:28] <Me-me> Also, what redundancy do you want removed? How do you tell it apart from the redundant parts you don't want removed?
[11:12:58] <re101-mau-24> https://regex101.com/r/eDsyD8/1
[11:13:00] <re101-mau-24> see noiw
[11:13:02] <re101-mau-24> now
[11:13:16] <Me-me> Okay.
[11:13:24] <Me-me> What redundancy do you want removed, then? How do you tell it apart from the redundant parts you don't want removed?
[11:13:31] <re101-mau-24> ya that rule is hard to tell here which needs to be fixed if you are getting our point
[11:13:44] <Me-me> I need to know the rule in order to put it into a regex though.
[11:14:02] <Me-me> digitok's done what you asked - if there are additional reasons why what he gave you isn't right, we need to know those reasons.
[11:15:07] <re101-mau-24> reasons are bank name is not repeating in the string while extracting, only address is getting repeated, so work needs to be done only on the address part
[11:18:26] <Me-me> Is the first line always three commas?
[11:18:40] <Me-me> That is, non-address, followed by a comma then an address?
[11:19:55] <Me-me> And is the repeated text always after that?
[11:24:14] <digitok> luckily we charge per minute
[11:24:22] <Me-me> :P

[14:23:38] <digitok> if you're gonna work here, we'll need more effort than pasting code into the regex box
[14:24:02] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/wNreAK/3
[14:25:16] <digitok> the address isn't removed because FIr != Flr
[14:25:56] <re101-mau-24> address is repeating twice

[14:26:54] <digitok> brb
[14:28:16] <re101-mau-24> ya i told you that the repeating words is not neccessarily have to be in consecutive position or the position very next to it, i just want to remove the duplicacy in the whole expression
[14:29:20] <re101-mau-24> and expression is consecutive redundant here too
[14:29:21] <re101-mau-24> Address: 1St FIr, 101 /A, B.N Chambers, Opp. Welcome Hotel, R.C.Dutt Rd,Alkapuri,
[14:29:35] <re101-mau-24> again this line repeating after this
[14:30:26] <re101-mau-24> and then at the last vadodra, vadora together which is basically in the second line of PDF in both shipping and billing address respectively
[14:30:54] <re101-mau-24> FIr != Flr ?
[14:38:44] <digitok> it means one contains FIr and one contains Flr
