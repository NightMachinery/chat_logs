[03:28:55] <Joanna> Has anyone heard of this if so how does it work?....Recently, fraudsters have used automatic calls as a method for gaining access to accounts. These calls appear to be from a financial institution or another company, such as Amazon, and inform individuals that their account has potentially been compromised. The call instructs the person to press 1 to confirm an unauthorized transaction, and then instructs the individual to enter
[03:28:55] <Joanna> a one-time password that was sent to their phone. This one-time password then gives the fraudster further access to your account.

[03:49:05] <hololeap> that bit of advice has been around for at least a decade, I think. so the fraud has existed in some form for a long time.
[03:49:13] <Joanna> So they spoof the phone number?
[03:50:03] <hololeap> that is a possibility. I've had a similar version of fraud where they hijacked an email server to send out legitimate-looking emails
[03:50:57] <Joanna> So is it like an automated phone call that asks you to enter your password to prove its you? I once had something like that for my voice mail that would call me when I had a new message and I would identify with pin
[03:51:48] <hololeap> sure, but you knew about that since you set it up. the broad advice is to trust nobody contacting you and asking for personal info
[03:52:59] <Joanna> Sometimes banks do send out legitimate fraud alerts by phone or call people
[03:53:38] <hololeap> yes, but the same banks will tell you what you need to know if you call them back. if the fraudsters have hijacked incoming calls as well, all bets are off

[05:03:35] <Joanna> hololeap: video removed?
[05:03:40] <mats1> he's as much a journalist as you are
[05:04:00] <Joanna> He is much more talented than I am by far
[05:04:17] <Joanna> mats1: what makes you think you know everything?
[05:04:41] <Joanna> What is your theory on what is happening?
[05:04:48] <mats1> i think its evident i spend more time reading primary sources than you do
[05:05:04] <mats1> instead of breitbart tier editorialism and con artistry
[05:05:20] <Joanna> Ok let’s hear what you know about it.
[05:05:26] <mats1> for all the readers in here, if you want actual news that's relatively unpolitical / unbiased, try financial papers like Bloomberg or FT
[05:05:57] <Joanna> Isn’t Bloomberg mainstream media?

[05:07:38] <Joanna> One thing is for sure the defense industry is making a lot of money from this
[05:08:35] <mats1> i almost exclusively consume left leaning news and the financial press, because its important to understand the dominant narrative, and more relevantly, i'm familiar with the manner in which they lie, and it is far less frequent
[05:09:16] <Joanna> You still haven’t shared what you have found out
[05:09:17] <mats1> and they write well, unlike the jr high level edgelord crap coming out of corbett
[05:09:21] <Joanna> If anything..
[05:10:12] <Joanna> So you still haven’t said what you think is happening all you are able to do is bash Corbett?
[05:10:49] <mats1> i don't have the energy to tell you the news, read an actual newspaper
[05:10:55] <Joanna> I’ve listened to a lot of his podcasts and learned a lot of things
[05:11:19] <Joanna> So you don’t know what is happening then ?
[05:11:27] <mats1> but maybe you are above reading, and prefer the youtubes and pods by shmucks outside the 'mainstream media'

[14:04:08] <trinityyy[m]> Bilbo: mac address filtering doesn't make sense for wifi networks. An attacker will sniff the devices, which are connected to your network, copies one of their MACs and connects as soon as the device disconnects from your network
[14:04:45] <bilbo> trinityyy[m]: yes, that's a good point
[14:05:44] <Affliction> And on a dumb switch, an attacker could listen to broadcasts to learn mac addresses, even if you filter by them on the hosts.

[14:07:04] <piou> the best way to understand wireless communications is to imagine a large dark room where people scream at each other without seing one another. Everybody hears everything, anybody can scream too, you just have to find ways to identify what message is for you and, if the communication is private, a way to decide how to continue screaming so that only one or two people understand and can answer in
[14:07:10] <piou> kind.
[14:08:56] <Affliction> I like that analogy, I'll have to steal it :)

[14:11:14] <Affliction> Wireless fingerprinting is possible to an extent, every transmitter is unique, it'll have its own clock drift, filter characteristics, etc. It might be possible to identify a transmitter by its "voice" (and I think some enterprise APs can do that fingerprinting)
[14:11:44] <Affliction> But, ultimately the cheaper radios won't even try to distinguish that difference, analogy might be, they give you a text transcript of what was shouted?
[14:13:11] <piou> and just like in real life, voice recognition is much less reliable than people imagine anyway

[15:05:41] <mrtnt_> Let's say, that one executes "curl -v -4 https://www.example.com/foobar" and HTTPS traffic is inspected by a L7 firewall. Am I correct, that the L7 firewall is able to see the www.example.com domain name thanks to TLS SNI extension, but not the "foobar" string in the URL?
[15:06:12] *** Joins: Alhazred (~Alhazred@ool-18b829c5.dyn.optonline.net)
[15:06:27] <Affliction> It depends on where that firewall is and how it's configured.
[15:06:51] <Affliction> If it's reverse proxying for example.com, it might also terminate TLS there, in which case it'd have access to the traffic.
[15:07:42] <Affliction> If it's on your network, and it has a cert you trust, it might terminate your client's TLS for inspection (before originating another TLS connection with example.com)
[15:08:04] <Affliction> The latter is possible on corp networks, for example
[15:08:26] <Affliction> Otherwise, if it doesn't have a cert clients trust for MITM, then yeah, it'd pretty much just have access to the domain name
[15:08:43] <Affliction> Either through SNI or DNS inspection (if not using DoT or DoH)
[15:09:51] <mrtnt_> Affliction: ok, thanks. Does the reverse proxy setup work also with TLS 1.3?
[15:10:07] <Affliction> yes

[15:11:09] <Affliction> in this case the reverse proxy has the cert for example.com, so, it's no different to the web server as far as the client's TLS implementation is concerned
