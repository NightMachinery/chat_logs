[17:28:56] <Yamakaja[m]> So do you want to reuse that code (albeit with some modifications) for your own out of tree module, or do you want to fix an issue?

[17:42:41] <Yamakaja[m]> Pretty much
[17:43:02] <Yamakaja[m]> May i ask what you want to change in that file?
[17:46:23] <mcan06[m]> Yamakaja[m]: I want to increase modulation order.
[17:48:18] <Yamakaja[m]> mcan06: Uh, i'm not sure if that's just going to work like that - maybe @drmpeg knows more? 
[17:49:00] <Yamakaja[m]> mcan06: Which lines exactly did you want to change?
[17:50:47] <drmpeg> I'm not sure what mcan06[m] wants to do. The modulation order can be changed by just selecting another constellation.
[17:55:18] <mcan06[m]> drmpeg: I'm trying to show performance of the another high modulation order which is not in standard.
[17:57:38] <drmpeg> Ok. You have two options. You can build GNU Radio from source and modify that file. Or you can use the chunks to symbols block and define your custom constellation with that.
[17:58:32] <drmpeg> Let me find you an example for chunks to symbols.

[23:11:57] <cpfig[m]> Hello. I am a newbie using GNU Radio for a university project. I need to use Windows (University PC uses it) and I would like to understand how can I create a custom block for a windows install. I am interested in designing a arcsin custom block, for now.
[23:16:37] <JoshMorman[m]> Look into the Embedded Python Blocks that you can make in python directly in GRC
[23:18:01] <cpfig[m]> those exist in windows installs? I cannot check right away because I'm actually using Ubuntu right now and would need to reboot
[23:20:06] <cpfig[m]> Ok, I just checked GNU Radio on my Ubuntu and I see a "Python Block", "Python Module" and "Python Snippet". I will check if these are also on Windows and look into how to use them. Thanks!

[23:53:53] <funkylab[m]> cpfig: GNU Radio is no different under Windows than under Linux. If these are not there, your version of GNU Radio is obsolete and must be updated.
