[01:55:02] <artao> still .... can't go in if you don't "dress right?"
[01:55:22] <artao> now, given the opportunity to PLAY at either of them
[01:55:23] <artao> oof
[01:55:27] <artao> probably, yeah

[02:01:43] <artao> The other day they posted their roadmap

[02:03:02] <artao> only the 2nd time i've done that. First time was Kerbal Space Program. And they did it RIGHT
[02:03:11] <artao> EXCELLENT example of how to do early access
[02:04:22] <louipc> i would go to ibiza
[02:05:09] <Panther> ppl don't know what they fuck to do because they have too many tools and too many toys, and there is less and less real work to be done, because everything is being made as easy as possible, so we eventually become purposeless blobs.
[02:06:12] <louipc> theres tons of real work to be done

[03:02:54] <artao> it affects the music i make. it inspires the music i make

[03:16:29] <artao> LOL
[03:16:40] <louipc> even using drum triggers is kinda controversial
[03:16:43] <artao> AFAIK metalheads pretty much hate goths
[03:17:05] <artao> there's sounds you can't get with physical drums
[03:17:11] <artao> thus drum triggers
[03:17:29] <artao> ESPECIALLY physical kick drum lacks REAL oomph!!
[03:17:47] <louipc> u supposed to just amplify it or something
[03:17:49] <artao> pysical kick will NEVER match synth kick for deep, hard, and heavy
[03:18:09] <louipc> i dunno im no drummer so not sure how they supposed to do it according to purists
[03:18:23] <artao> a physical kick drum is simply incapable of making (emphasizing) the frequencies that synth drums can
[03:18:32] <artao> under 50hz for instance
[03:18:37] <louipc> what if it goes thru effects
[03:18:44] <artao> eh
[03:18:49] <artao> you can only do so much with fx
[03:19:03] <artao> you can crank the bass on a physical kick, but it's gonna sound like you did that
[03:19:06] <louipc> the idea is that if you have a weak kick it should sound weak
[03:19:11] <artao> an electronic kick just HAS IT
[03:19:19] <louipc> if you have a strong kick should be strong
[03:19:30] <louipc> triggers remove natural dynamics from the musician
[03:19:31] <macrobat> I haven't really listened to skinny puppy. I don't remember their tunes
[03:19:32] <artao> OTOH, electronic kicks are totally out of place in, like ... blues, country, some forms of jazz
[03:19:46] <artao> WHAT? triggers don't remove natural dynamics
[03:19:53] <artao> that's an old thing. that's no longer true
[03:19:59] <louipc> at least old ones then
[03:20:16] <artao> i agree regarding old ones. yes
[03:20:33] <artao> modern ones? just as responsive, including playing fidelity and nuances
[03:20:36] <louipc> but it's easy for a drummer that can't hit as hard to turn up the oompf on his triggers
[03:20:41] <artao> ... depending how much you pay, of course
[03:20:42] <louipc> so thus = fake

[03:23:23] <louipc> it is nice to know a performers real ability/talent
[03:23:32] <artao> eh?
[03:23:39] <artao> what is "ability" and "talent"?
[03:23:49] <artao> what's regarded as a musical instrument?
[03:23:52] <macrobat> oh, some german video I watched used "Wumms" for oomph. i lolled out loud
[03:24:05] <artao> louipc I'm curious what you think about DJs, since you've said that
[03:24:16] <artao> are DJ's "real" musicians
[03:24:18] <artao> ?
[03:24:21] <louipc> artao: like actual playing drums vs miming it to a track
[03:24:29] <artao> note: that's a trap :P
[03:24:29] <louipc> or lipsync vs actual singing
[03:24:43] <artao> mk. what is "actual playing drums?"
[03:24:57] <artao> for instance. I have an electronic MIDI drum controller
[03:25:05] <artao> I can either step program it or play it live
[03:25:11] <macrobat> DJ Foo: "Want to go see a movie?" DJ Bar: "Who's the projectionist?"
[03:25:19] <artao> BOTH take skill and a feel for the groove
[03:25:20] <louipc> yes play it live
[03:25:42] <louipc> dude if you're miming playing it while its just a track then that is deceptive
[03:25:52] <louipc> so thats not ok
[03:25:53] <artao> is it MORE "valid" for me to program the drums live-playing than it is to program it step wise?
[03:26:08] <louipc> but if i know that it's a track/program then that's fine
[03:26:09] <artao> louipc OH!@ MIMING? yeah. fuck those people
[03:26:13] <artao> yeah. of course
[03:26:26] <artao> like ... okay
[03:26:46] <louipc> same with lipsync
[03:26:50] <macrobat> do they put envelope followers after real drums to control synth drums?
[03:26:51] <artao> i know i want to have a 4/4 kick. ... why would i "play" that rather than just turn on the steps for it?
[03:26:58] <artao> ZERO chance of fuckup
[03:27:06] <louipc> i understand why ppl lipsync tho
[03:27:13] <artao> macrobat some people do, sure
[03:27:17] <louipc> nite after nite would take a real toll
[03:27:24] <louipc> gotta make money rite
[03:27:43] <artao> and when you've got actual "songs" to do? You HAVE TO  program those drums to play automatically

[03:29:20] <macrobat> hello frmus
[03:29:21] <louipc> artao: like a singer's voice wearing out
[03:29:36] <louipc> from too much singing
[03:29:49] <artao> mk. yah. or a brass player's lips wearing out. or a guitarist/bassist/s fingers wearing out
[03:29:55] <louipc> sure
[03:30:19] <artao> that mostly doesn't happen with life musicians, unless they're out of practice (like me with trunmpet ... shut up)
[03:30:24] <louipc> the voice is more finnicky than all those tho
[03:30:36] <louipc> so is the best example
[03:30:39] <artao> nope
[03:30:44] <frmus> how are you macrobat
[03:31:07] <artao> louipc have you ever played guitar, bass, or brass?

[03:31:21] <macrobat> how are things, frmus?
[03:31:22] <louipc> voice is more finnicky
[03:31:38] <macrobat> tinariwen subtitled in swedish, for those of us who don't speak tuareg
[03:31:40] <louipc> guitar bass and brass and sing
[03:31:49] <artao> and yeah, a singer's voice is FAR more likely to "wear out" than ANY instrument player
[03:31:50] <artao> 100%
[03:32:06] <louipc> yes
[03:32:06] <artao> singing is .... yeah. ... it can be HELL on the vocal chords
[03:32:07] <frmus> im alright

[03:32:45] <artao> okay, you know what? yeah 
[03:32:59] <artao> i withdraw my objection to "voice being the most finicky"
[03:33:00] <artao> yep
[03:33:05] <artao> it TOTALLY is LOL
[03:33:07] <macrobat> frmus: what kind of dancing and music?
[03:33:21] <artao> i know i myself am a day-to-day "can i sing or not" person

[03:35:51] <artao> envelope followers is one thing i STILL haven't quite wrapped my mind around. I've never even used it.
[03:35:54] <louipc> no point in playing anymore
[03:36:01] <artao> huh? how does it work? what does it do? o.O
[03:36:29] <macrobat> it is bad to skip a couple of days when playing brass. it is hard work to keep lip stamina fresh
[03:36:32] <artao> i don't get it. how does it "read" the "envelope" .... isn't there a delay then to "read" the envelope then pass it along to other destinations?
[03:36:51] <artao> is it a volts-per-second thing?
[03:37:09] <artao> <louipc> i understand why ppl lipsync tho

[03:37:22] <artao> FUCK
[03:37:34] <artao> pretty much every movie and tv show you watch is lip synced
[03:37:51] <louipc> yea it makes sense for music vids
[03:37:59] <macrobat> maybe one can think of it almost like a lowpass filter, more like DC than AC
[03:38:18] <louipc> but other than highly produced stuff
[03:38:26] <louipc> there is art in the fuckups

[03:41:00] <louipc> i have, but i was talkin about singing
[03:41:21] <louipc> mostly trumpet, some smidge of trombone
[03:41:33] <artao> macrobat when you've been practicing playing HIGH notes, especially playing fast, it's good to take a day or two break
[03:41:36] <louipc> would be nice to get into it again
[03:41:40] <artao> or at leat just play basic low scales

[03:44:15] <artao> Happy Accidents, as Bob Ross called them
[03:44:16] <louipc> but thats just not from keeping lips maintained
[03:44:19] <artao> no, not chapped lips
[03:44:27] <artao> that's a medical condition of dry lips
[03:44:38] <louipc> dry/chapped lips sure
[03:44:44] <louipc> its not from the playing itself tho
[03:44:47] <artao> just, in gneral ... chapped or not, lips can "crack" in very low humidity situations
[03:44:58] <macrobat> in winter I don't leave the house without chapstick
[03:45:03] <louipc> i thought u meant your fully-healthy lips were overstressed and started bleeding
[03:45:09] <artao> ESPECIALLY on high notes. With trumpet that means anything above the staff
[03:45:23] <artao> i used to be able to reach C# on trumpet. But not for long
[03:45:28] <louipc> vaseline is the best
[03:45:30] <artao> B and Bb i could do 
[03:45:34] <artao> NO
[03:45:37] <artao> NO NO NO

[03:46:23] <artao> Vaseline is a petroleum product. Ultimately it saps moisture rather than hold it in. Over time.

[03:48:50] <macrobat> vaseline on urself? not on the slides?
[03:48:54] <artao> menthol just makes your lips numb, so you don't know when they're reaching their limit

[03:49:20] <louipc> hawt

[04:11:21] <louipc> macrobat: it actually is a really good solution. the only problem is they didn't engineer a good removal mechanism
[04:11:45] <louipc> hmm this would be a great idea to address
[04:11:49] <louipc> i already have an idea
[04:12:12] <macrobat> sell every brass instrument with the tool permanently attached
[04:12:14] <louipc> would help to put some lube between mouthpiece and lead pipe every time
[04:12:23] <macrobat> idk
[04:12:38] <louipc> im thinking of a mouthpiece with flat sections that any wrench can twist on
[04:13:08] <macrobat> and a section on the receiver
[04:13:08] <louipc> i dont like that removal tools that bear against the pipe lip
[04:13:16] <louipc> too easy to damage the pipe
[04:13:22] <macrobat> or what it's called
[04:13:27] <louipc> lead pipe
[04:13:40] <louipc> yea flat on mouthpiece and flat on the pipe
[04:13:44] <louipc> then 2 wrenches
[04:13:48] <louipc> bang done
[04:14:00] <louipc> but also oil every time you assemble them
[04:14:27] <louipc> iduno i was a major mechanical n00b when i played trumpet
[04:14:41] <louipc> i put the sticky stuff on the 3rd valve slide lol
[04:18:40] <macrobat> I accidentally copper shine paste into the valves. had to be rehoned

[04:55:33] <artao> BOOP
[04:55:53] <artao> what did i miss while making a post on Session's Steam page?
[04:56:08] <artao> <louipc> theres different kind of slide lubes too
[04:56:17] <artao> yes. depending what it's for of course.
[04:56:39] <artao>  a tuning slide needs a thicker lube so it doesn't move, but still needs to move easily
[04:56:49] <artao> a valve lube needs to be INSTANT
[04:57:10] <artao> <macrobat> I left the vaseline too long in the trumpet case. it separated and leaked over my sheet music and etude book
[04:57:12] <artao> yuk
[04:57:33] <artao> it can be remixed back into normal vaselline. it IS after all a petrochem product
[04:57:35] <artao> they never die
[04:57:48] <artao> in the OLD days, they used animal fat
[04:58:23] <artao> <louipc> trumpet cases should really be made to allow the mouthpiece attached. got it stuck so many times.
[04:58:38] <artao> LOLL your fault. ... mine too. i've done it many times
[04:58:50] <artao> it's a physics thing
[04:59:12] <artao> at least i recently shared my shitty trumpet playing LOL
[04:59:22] <artao> knowing it was shitty, mind you
[04:59:39] <artao> <macrobat> my teacher had a special tool for when mouthpieces get stuck
[04:59:47] <louipc> i havent look at recent trumpet/mouthpiece designs, but now that i know 2 shits about mechanics i can theorise how i would remedy the situation
[04:59:50] <macrobat> you avoid bumping it into things like you avoid bumping a wound into things
[04:59:58] <artao> that is THE ONLY WAY to remove a stuck mouthpiece without damaging the instrument
[05:00:30] <macrobat> I think "tolerances" and "conical fit" might be keywords
[05:00:34] <artao> what it does is make the linear moment higher than the rotational moment
[05:00:55] <louipc> you can break the seal by rotation
[05:01:23] <macrobat> acappella folk. no instruments were hurt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaN_YkDsANU
[05:01:24] <artao> the ONLY way to get a mouthpiece stuck is ... well ..... abuse
[05:01:27] <artao> or a fuck up
[05:01:27] <Janet> ^ Jag Vet En Dejlig Rosa - YouTube
[05:01:28] <louipc> its just hard/awkward to grab that way because of shape of the intrument, plus delicate soldering
[05:01:37] <louipc> plus size and shape of the mouthpiece
[05:01:40] <artao> and any pro brass player has a mouthpiece extractor
[05:01:43] <artao> also easy to make
[05:02:07] <artao> louipc trumpet mouthpiece designs are the same they've been forever
[05:02:11] <louipc> artao: one that pops it off by bearing down on the pipe?
[05:02:12] <artao> there's no need to change them
[05:02:19] <artao> huh?
[05:02:36] <louipc> artao: yea the only reason to change it for easier extraction when it gets stuck
[05:02:37] <artao> yes. linear forcef beats torsional force
[05:02:44] <artao> LOL no
[05:02:56] <artao> if you get your mouthpiece stuck ... that's on YOU
[05:03:01] <artao> not the instrument
[05:03:08] <louipc> thats not the point
[05:03:18] <artao> nothing needs to be "fixed" except how you interact with your instrument
[05:03:45] <artao> tools already exist (even DIY at home) to extract a mouthpiece you've fuckedly got into the instrument
[05:03:46] <louipc> dude matching tapers are designed to take EXTREME forces
[05:03:57] <artao> one thing you DO NOT DO is try to twist is out
[05:04:00] <louipc> they used in heavy duty CNC metal cutting machines
[05:04:08] <artao> OOPS nope. OOPS broken lead tubs
[05:04:27] <louipc> twist out is fine. other than the delicate soldering
[05:04:34] <artao> <sigh> the forces they'e design to take are not torsional
[05:04:35] <louipc> would take much less force than pull out
[05:04:38] <artao> in fact .. WTAF
[05:04:39] <artao> NO
[05:04:57] <artao> brass mouthpieces are NOT designed to take "extreme forces"
[05:05:08] <artao> the "forces" on a mouthpiece are minor
[05:05:19] <artao> all you need is a seal
[05:05:19] <louipc> its abut the geometry of matching tapers
[05:05:24] <artao> um
[05:05:32] <louipc> you dont seem to understand the pure mechanics
[05:05:34] <morlog> pour some hot water on it, brass expands quite a bit when heated
[05:05:35] <artao> plz elaborate. i don't understand what you8 mean by that
[05:05:53] <artao> don't insult me by saying i "don't understand pure mechanics"
[05:06:02] <morlog> so does silver
[05:06:06] <artao> mechanics has NOTHING to do with brass mouthpieces
[05:06:19] <louipc> the same matching tapers geometry as in brass mouthpiece into lead pipe is the same concept used to hold heavy duty tools in machinery
[05:06:22] <artao> all the mouthpiece does is focus what your lips do
[05:06:40] <artao> NOTHING to do with physcs
[05:06:56] <louipc> ok you're all over the place anyways
[05:07:08] <morlog> the mouthpiece is wha makes the sound, the res of the horn is there to shape the sound
[05:07:09] <louipc> no point trying to debat it. would just have to show it in real life
[05:07:22] <louipc> believe me or don't thats fine
[05:08:03] <artao> HOLD ON HERE
[05:08:09] * artao takes a step back
[05:08:30] <artao> I MAY be being deliberately .......... what's the word ..... at odds
[05:08:40] <louipc> you do have one point tho if you twist, you risk galling the surfaces
[05:08:41] <artao> if so, my bad
[05:08:50] <artao> galling?
[05:08:54] <artao> idk that word
[05:09:00] <louipc> its kind of like a messy cold welding
[05:09:12] <artao> looking it up. of course
[05:09:25] <louipc> then the surfaces will be all rough and won't mate well anymore 
[05:09:25] <artao> adhesion between sliding surfaces
[05:09:26] <artao> mk
[05:09:42] <artao> LOL sex is the first thing that cums to mind
[05:09:53] <artao> galling causes ejaculation
[05:10:00] <louipc> i dont like the pull extractors because they rely on a small lip of the lead pipe to bear against
[05:10:19] <louipc> i guess first step is to increase the bearing surface for extraction
[05:10:38] <louipc> also pull extractors kinda big and ungainly
[05:10:43] <artao> it has to be full-body contact for a safe extraction. AND ENTIRELY linear
[05:10:46] <louipc> at least the one i seen
[05:10:52] <artao> any side pull will likely crack the lead tube
[05:11:11] <artao> BEST extraction is probably careful heat
[05:11:25] <louipc> could be possible to design a small one that pulls pushes from the back of the mouthpiece rather than pulling from the front of it
[05:11:30] <artao> Heat the lead tube so it expands, but such that the mouthpiece doesn't
[05:11:37] <louipc> nah i dont like heat
[05:11:52] <artao> At ANY RATE!! Getting a stuck mouthpiece out is  SERIOUS BITCH!!
[05:11:52] <louipc> that can desolder
[05:12:02] <artao> AND can easily result in a destroyed lead tube
[05:12:12] <louipc> but yea at least the cases could allow you to carry around the thing until you get it out later
[05:12:25] <artao> Torsional binding is, for some reason, greater than linear binding
[05:12:31] <louipc> maybe a little hole with flap lol
[05:12:41] <artao> You mean your pussy?
[05:12:46] <artao> LMAO
[05:12:50] <artao> sry, you set that up
[05:12:51] <louipc> no your moms
[05:13:12] <artao> as much as i like "yer mom" jokes, i would ask that you refrain
[05:13:30] <artao> i'm still not over my mom dying Oct 2020
[05:13:32] <artao> :(
[05:13:36] <artao> that's me, not you
[05:13:37] <louipc> hey dont start crying when u start the pussy jokes
[05:13:52] <artao> i can't even make "yer mom" joke myse4lf anymore. and i used to ON THAT
[05:13:53] <artao> lol
[05:14:15] <artao> when yer mom dies, tell me how funny "yer mom" jokes are
[05:14:27] <artao> give me a few years and i'll be down with em again
[05:14:29] <artao> :D
[05:14:38] <louipc> extremely if im telling yer dead mom jokes
[05:14:53] <artao> OTOH i can do"yer dad" jokes
[05:15:04] <artao> Like: Why are you alive louipc?
[05:15:05] <louipc> do dead baby jokes
[05:15:16] <louipc> cuz i feel like it
[05:15:17] <artao> Cuz yer dad didn't pull out like he said he would
[05:15:18] <artao> BOOM
[05:15:32] <artao> dead baby jokes? OH YEAH
[05:15:51] <artao> What's the difference between a truck load of dead babies and a truckload of straw?
[05:16:40] <louipc> theres no song about a turkey in a truckload of dead babies
[05:17:26] <artao> no?
[05:17:29] <artao> well!!
[05:17:33] <artao> we need to make one!!
[05:17:49] <artao> wait no
[05:17:50] <louipc> will it use the same tune as turkey in the straw
[05:18:01] <artao> that was an answer to the joke
[05:18:04] <artao> NOPE
[05:18:36] <artao> The difference between a truckload of dead babies and a truckload of straw is that you can easily unload the truckload of straw with a pitchfork.
[05:19:05] <artao> LOL that'd be a fun? project. Techno to turkey in the straw

[14:24:15] <sublim20> i understand the financial arguments of piracy, its still illegal.  
[14:24:18] <Deadly_Alive> and this way they may discover a new band they like and purchase Vinyl/CD or go to the concert
[14:24:43] <Deadly_Alive> so the artist actually makes money that they otherwise would not
[14:24:53] <sublim20> but the real reason im against posting such things in the chat, is that by posting illegal things here, you may draw unwanted attention
[14:25:18] <sublim20> well, its not your work to decide what to do with it, or to share it.
[14:26:22] <tinystoat> what's the difference between #music and ##music?
[14:30:52] <sublim20> i think the goal is that, ## is for more offtopic things, while # is for projects

[15:51:13] <tinystoat> macrobat: the funny thing about a "cult" is that folks miss the function of what that is: a tried and true system of indoctrination whether that is religion, patriotism, nationalism, state education, and many more.
[15:51:53] <tinystoat> so it's always interesting to see people from one cult indentify another group as a cult purely missing they're in one as well.
[15:52:47] <tinystoat> and music is often part of the effective seduction inside a cult.

[21:18:07] <R2robot> I was riding in the HOV lane.. concrete barriers on both sides. SUPER strong winds.. I had the bike leaned well over.. going straight.  Had to learn even harder to fight the gusts.. then the gust suddenly stopped and I nearly hit the inside wall. lol
[21:18:41] <murthy> side winds would easily topple a light weight motorcycle on high speed on a open road
[21:19:00] <R2robot> I wouldn't say topple, but you do get pushed around a lot
[21:19:08] <murthy> one reason why low weight bikes are not given fairings
[21:19:24] <R2robot> also not quite true
[21:19:32] <R2robot> 250 sport bikes have fairings
