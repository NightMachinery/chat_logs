[00:41:03] <Patsie> slowly making some progress -> http://awk.patsie.nl/awk-demo02.mp4
[00:41:43] <emanuele6> that's epic!
[00:42:58] <xmb> is that real 3d balls and metaballs or avi together
[00:43:44] <Patsie> this is all 'real'
[00:43:53] * f00 gawking at the demo
[00:43:55] <Patsie> real metaballs
[00:44:19] <xmb> i gotta check your code mate i did i remember and it never made sense due to overlong naming of everything
[00:44:23] <xmb> and overdetails
[00:44:31] <xmb> i can use a console drawer
[00:45:26] <Patsie> 'overlong naming'? ou're saying my variable names are too explicit? you'd rather have x, i and z as variables? :D
[00:46:47] <Patsie> the only 'fake' thing is that I use ffmplay to play the mp3 music (from awk though)
[00:46:51] <Patsie> function play(fname,    music) {
[00:46:51] <Patsie>   music = sprintf("ffplay -v -8 -nodisp \"%s\"", fname)
[00:46:51] <Patsie>   print "" | music
[00:46:51] <Patsie> }
[00:47:12] <Patsie> simple enough to start some music in the background :D
[00:47:58] <Patsie> but it makes the demo as a whole a lot better
[00:48:09] <Earnestly> Ha, a scroller
[00:48:22] <Patsie> yeah, can't have an old-skool demo without a scroller :)
[00:48:40] <Earnestly> I remember Gods
[00:48:48] <Earnestly> Old DOS game
[00:49:08] <Patsie> yup
[00:49:45] <Patsie> converted to xpm picture, so it's easy to parse with ask
[00:49:51] <Patsie> awk*
[00:49:57] <Earnestly> Patsie: https://ourmachinery.com/post/writing-a-low-level-sound-system/
[00:50:35] <nmz> Patsie: you know he does, his code is unintelligible
[00:51:29] <Patsie> Earnestly: yeah, not gonna happen. decoding mp3 in awk would be very heavy
[00:51:35] <Earnestly> Patsie: pcm!
[00:51:42] <Patsie> nmz: yeah, I know
[00:51:49] <Patsie> Earnestly: too much data
[00:51:50] <xmb> you gotta make a input array filter
[00:52:05] <Earnestly> Patsie: Does it have to be?  It's not like chiptunes need much
[00:52:07] <Patsie> I'm happy with my ffmplay hack
[00:52:12] <xmb> you define filter values, by format, mp3, and snd output, then filter the data thru arrays in one stack many
[00:52:21] <Earnestly> Especially older formats like xm
[00:52:56] <Patsie> writing a mod-player is a completely different excersize
[00:53:06] <Earnestly> Oh nice https://github.com/milkytracker/MilkyTracker/blob/master/resources/reference/xm-form.txt
[00:53:12] <Earnestly> Documented they did
[00:53:23] <Patsie> you guys are just trying to steer me from my true goal :D
[00:54:02] <Patsie> Earnestly: if you write an xm-player in awk, I will incorporate it into awk-demo :D
[00:54:13] <Earnestly> Patsie: I remember I have this lot: https://0x0.st/oKnE.txt
[00:55:04] <Earnestly> I wonder how many of these can play with mpv/ffmpeg
[00:55:44] <Earnestly> Patsie: Btw, you might like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_W72o2YBJo
[00:58:13] <Patsie> I'll have a look later

[02:48:00] <Earnestly> That would be peak intelligibility
[02:48:18] <Earnestly> Notation as Tools of Thought \o/
[02:48:48] <Earnestly> It's a quite 4GL-ish way of programming while still in a 3GL language
[02:49:14] <Earnestly> nmz: I would argue, look at gcc's implementation of the C++ STL
[02:49:40] <nmz> gimme link
[02:51:13] <emanuele6> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)
[02:52:27] <Earnestly> nmz: https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/tree/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits
[02:53:04] <Earnestly> People think their code is generated
[02:53:16] <Earnestly> nmz: A bit like glibc vs musl
[02:53:35] <Earnestly> E.g. https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/tree/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits
[02:53:40] <Earnestly> deque.tcc
[02:53:53] <nmz> I see its very legible
[02:53:59] <nmz> and I didn't even click on that one
[02:54:44] <Earnestly> It's certainly not
[02:56:23] <Earnestly> legibility is predicated on clarity, to call this 'very' legible is dishonest and done in bad faith.  J has a set of nouns which you don't know, so it's legibility would be that of any language you don't know
[02:57:29] <Earnestly> This is C++, a language which you might know, written in such a way that makes it inscrutable without great effort to learn these custom idioms
[02:57:48] <Earnestly> its*
[02:58:59] <Earnestly> It is also widely regarded as a problem by everyone who has tried to understand it, a certain degree of beyensian thinking is acceptable
[03:00:53] <Earnestly> Also worth noting that Stepanov and co. have produced readable code implementing the STL
