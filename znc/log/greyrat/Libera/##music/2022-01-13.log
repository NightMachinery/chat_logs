[20:09:42] <Panther> Most people used to consume enough iodine — in the form of iodized salt — which was found in breads. But, in the latter half of the 20th century, iodine was replaced with a chemical called potassium bromide to make bread fluffier, according to Dr. Gedroic.
[20:10:29] <MusicalDillo> interesting, didn't know about that trend
[20:11:20] <Panther> Bromide is an anti epileptic and a sedative in high enough doses.
[20:13:23] <Panther> I like sea salt and Himalayan salt, but I also mainly use iodized salt to make sure.

[21:26:23] <artao> she had a stroke and was moved to a nursing home
[21:26:25] <Prutz> Thats cool DOMF
[21:26:30] <artao> SHE didn't give it to me
[21:26:42] <murthy> You took it from her?
[21:26:45] <louipc> 1000 bucks sounds insane price
[21:26:49] <artao> people had to clean out her apartment, and another neighbor told them that i'd like the piano
[21:27:00] <artao> so they just wheeled it over to my apartment. 
[21:27:12] <louipc> i wouldnt pay more than 200
[21:27:13] <artao> which i'm sure they appreciated, rather than actually having to move the piano
[21:27:19] <artao> it was most likely just gonna get thrown away
[21:27:25] <artao> so moreso i saved the piano
[21:27:30] <louipc> on a quality piano anyways

[21:28:47] <artao> and re: tuning .... it's in tune with itself but a bit flat in general

[21:28:58] <louipc> murthy: do you imply theres a way to tune it automatically?
[21:29:08] <artao> it's an okay piano. not great, not terrible
[21:29:22] <louipc> murthy: im guessing shouldnt take longer than 2 hrs
[21:29:44] <louipc> i'm guessing thats how long i would take to tune it

[21:30:34] <Janet> ^ My New Piano.jpg - Google Drive
[21:30:35] <louipc> but you pay for the service, not the time
[21:30:52] <morlog> tuning a piano would probably be an al day if not multiday thing for someone that hasnt done it before
[21:30:57] <louipc> so me $200- 2hrs, other guy $200- 1hrs
[21:31:01] <artao> louipc you gonna tune a piano?
[21:31:04] <louipc> he makes more money still ;)
[21:31:06] <louipc> artao: nah
[21:31:09] <morlog> its more than just getting the strings in tune
[21:31:13] <artao> i've been thinking about trying to tune mine back to A440
[21:31:21] <morlog> the hammers also need to be checked
[21:31:31] <murthy> morlog: what about deaf people
[21:31:34] <artao> but like i said, it's in tune with itself, so it's really just fine
[21:31:38] <louipc> morlog: ok i mean what about a piano in good condition
[21:31:55] <artao> how long it takes depends how well you know how to do it
[21:32:01] <louipc> but sure. you give it a good once-over
[21:32:19] <louipc> if hammers are falling apart and shit that should be all done first before tuning
[21:32:21] <murthy> artao: did someone suggested you an electronic tuner earlier?
[21:32:27] <artao> no
[21:32:31] <artao> easy to come by
[21:32:34] <morlog> its not something thats going to go quickly the first few times you do it
[21:32:40] <artao> phone. tablet. microphone into computer ....
[21:32:47] <louipc> yea i think everyone is gonna use an electronic tone indicator
[21:32:49] <morlog> think about the size and amount of parts
[21:32:53] <louipc> aka 'tuner'
[21:32:58] <artao> tho i WOULD like a set of tuning forks. which is what pro piano tuners use
[21:33:10] <louipc> or should you call the wrenches a 'tuner'
[21:33:11] <artao> cuz you can set them on the soundboard to hear how the piano is
[21:33:19] <morlog> you just need 1
[21:33:20] <artao> they're called tuning wrenches
[21:33:26] <artao> and they're not expensive
[21:33:30] <louipc> ;D
[21:33:48] <artao> i don't see why a standard socket wrench wouldn't work tho. with the right head of course. square
[21:33:58] <louipc> ok yea i guess a pro would be more into the resonance with forks and shit
[21:34:12] <morlog> you can use a water spigot handle
[21:34:14] <louipc> but i have a feeling electronic devices can do just about the same now
[21:34:32] <morlog> really close
[21:34:41] <louipc> like some guitar tuners attach directly to guitar and are sensing the resonance
[21:34:55] <murthy> artao: without the flex joint a normal one would damange the fastner
[21:35:04] <morlog> still some things analogue and acoustic can do that digital cant
[21:35:10] <artao> electronic devices can hear the piano and tell you what its playing, but they can't do the whole piano soundboard resonance thing
[21:35:19] <artao> flex joint?
[21:35:23] <murthy> morlog: silcokkey?
[21:35:38] <louipc> artao: what about something that attaches to soundboard

[21:45:24] <murthy> macrobat: record and share it
[21:45:28] <artao> conversely, she's mellowing out
[21:45:41] <artao> not as bitey for one thing. SUPER DUPER cuddly
[21:45:57] <murthy> artao: it's a cute one to remember :)
[21:46:08] <murthy> Ya
[21:46:12] <macrobat> 2 cats are better than one. they can keep eachother company
[21:46:17] <artao> :)
[21:46:18] * Panther nods
[21:46:32] <Panther> I can only have one here, so I decided not to get one.
[21:46:35] <murthy> macrobat: or a pain in the a
[21:46:39] <Panther> Besides, it would eat up all my armies :(
[21:46:47] <murthy> Fighting and breaking stuff
[21:47:09] <murthy> Whole light fighting and making baby noises
[21:47:15] <murthy> Whole night
[21:47:19] <Panther> "Giant atomic cat destroys 11th Panzer Division!:
[21:47:51] <Panther> Bullets won't stop it.
[21:48:14] <macrobat> protect your armies by putting sleevies over
[21:48:32] * Panther sends in the Luftwaffe.
[21:48:36] <murthy> Panther and the cats :D
[21:48:48] <murthy> Sounds like a cool band name
[21:48:59] <Panther> Actually, I do have a kitten, but it stays on my bed all the time.
[21:49:29] <Panther> It has been a kitten for a long time now, so I don't think it is going to get any bigger.
[21:49:34] <murthy> Nice
[21:51:01] <Panther> Фриский

[21:51:55] <Cale> https://cale.l5.ca/music/2022-01-13-17edo%20improvisation.mp3 -- a little bit of playing around with 17 equal divisions of the octave
[21:51:55] <artao> <macrobat> 2 cats are better than one. they can keep eachother company
[21:52:25] <artao> and 3 is even better, cuz then when one dies there's still 2 to comfort each other
[21:53:04] <murthy> Cale: hi

[21:53:12] <Janet> (REDIRECT) ^ KASSAV' * LAGUE MOIN - YouTube
[21:53:12] <Cale> After all the time I've spent with 31edo, it has nothing that I'd recognise as a major or minor third, but it feels like apart from the perfect fifth and fourth, everything else in 17edo is almost equally consonant/dissonant to me. So once you're free of a very narrow harmonic band over a pitch, you can kind of go anywhere.
[21:53:46] <artao> FUCK
[21:54:07] <artao> i just realized: I don't have enuf MIDI cables to run to all my synths when I get that Roland System 1M
[21:54:12] <Panther> Ше куьштвы ьу ф дшееду 
[21:54:14] <artao> easy enuf to rectify i guess
[21:54:20] <Panther> Whoops
[21:54:28] <artao> only need a couple short ones
[21:54:40] <Panther> It reminds me a little of the beginning of 'The End' by The Doors, Cale.
[21:54:45] <artao> or, rather, not "realized." moreso "remembered"
[21:54:46] <artao> lol
[21:55:07] <artao> and actually three more MIDI cables would be better
[21:55:43] <artao> my MIDI hub only has 4 outs, but with the System 1M I have 5 things that can take MIDI
[21:55:52] <Panther> If you have enough MIs and DIs, sure.. have as many as you want. :)
[21:55:54] <artao> 4 synths and the Volca Sample
[21:56:16] *** Joins: sublim20 (~sublim20@user/sublim20)
[21:56:20] <artao> tho one of the synths i use more as a FX box. the Korg NTS--1
[21:56:27] <artao> AWESOME little unit. only 100usd
[21:56:55] * sublim20 dances
[21:57:00] <artao> single oscillator and 3 fx slots. all 4 of which can load user-made stuff
[21:57:23] <macrobat> parents had two cats. one got ill and died
[21:57:31] <artao> the oscillator  is compatible with the Korg Prolog and Monologue XD
[21:57:40] <artao> er ... the whole thing is compatilble. derp
[21:57:57] <Cale> Panther: haha, I see it :)
[21:58:02] <artao> i HIGHLY recommend the NTS-1
[21:58:03] * Panther smiles
[21:58:25] <artao> i intend to get another one to use as an insert effect (which reminds me, i need an insert cable lol)
[21:58:27] <murthy> Cale: This is very nice!
[21:59:15] <murthy> I wish you would compose a longer piece with this one
[21:59:43] <artao> anyhow, two of the synths have MIDI thru, so i can just use a short MIDI cable to access all the units
[22:00:12] <artao> BTW why was piano being discussed earlier?
[22:00:16] <artao> Who else has a piano?
[22:00:46] <artao> while i have one, i'm definitely not a piano player. i can fiddle around tho. i like exploring chords and chord structures

[22:02:03] <murthy> :(
[22:02:39] <macrobat> I don't have an ear for xenharmonics. difficult to know what is played
[22:02:39] <Cale> I can't really play the normal piano keyboard, but I have a lumatone that I've been playing for almost a year, which is kind of a piano-esque instrument :)
[22:03:43] <murthy> Cale: omg did you forgot that you streamed for me last time?
[22:03:52] <Cale> I remember :)
[22:04:02] <murthy> That's a relief
[22:04:42] <murthy> Cale: why not create a piece like the fellow who's video you shared once
[22:05:06] <murthy> That fellow was fast with his lumanote keyboard
[22:05:20] <murthy> Lumatone
[22:05:26] <Cale> hmm... Mike Battaglia maybe?
[22:05:36] <murthy> Let me check
[22:06:15] <murthy> Oh yes, that's the fellow
[22:06:24] <Cale> I'm getting to the point where I'm starting to consider actually producing things nicely.
[22:06:37] <murthy> Very very good with his lumatone keyboard
[22:06:52] <murthy> Cale: nice
[22:06:58] <Cale> Mike was already a decent pianist when he got his Lumatone :)
[22:07:16] <Cale> I hadn't played an instrument in many years, and even then, it was a clarinet in highschool :)
[22:07:21] <murthy> Yes indeed, the one with a guitar like one was impressive
[22:07:24] <murthy> Fast hands
