[00:20:10] <bomb> waht  yuo mean>?

[00:22:18] <bomb> congratulations, you're still alive
[00:22:22] <bomb> so, how did it go?
[00:22:27] <jmer> bomb: I fucking sucked at the bowling, but the developer who'd been there for 23 years, knows about new language features of C# and knows about net5/6...
[00:23:09] <jmer> bomb: I mean not a single teammember on my current team could tell you what the diff is between .net core and net 5
[00:23:20] <bomb> haha that's cool
[00:23:35] <jmer> well it's a low bar... but still
[00:23:48] <bomb> how they say, always be the dumbest person in the room
[00:24:25] <bomb> no, man it's cool. on the internet we're bunch of gear heads. knowing all the new developments and such
[00:24:30] <jmer> bomb: also there are two java devs on the team... one of which is a dad joke conneseur
[00:24:39] <gufi> hah nice
[00:24:47] <bomb> but it's cool to be around a 50+ year old programmer who isn't making Cobol programs for IBM mainframes
[00:24:56] <jmer> also the dev who's been there for 23 years... Has been there as an external consultant xD
[00:25:03] <bomb> or Pascal for the "new 486 thing"
[00:25:18] <jmer> bomb: Yeah.. I was quite impressed this guy is in his late 40s or maybe even 50s (I didn't ask this is my estimate)
[00:25:36] <bomb> sounds like a great place to work jmer glad to hear :)
[00:25:58] <Lukky> errr... I'm 55, and never wrote a single line of COBOL...
[00:25:58] <jmer> and everyone was quite open and welcoming, no cold shoulders or people only ansering with yes/no
[00:26:22] <jmer> Lukky: this guy told me he started with C
[00:26:27] <jmer> so neither did he
[00:26:42] <Lukky> I started on Vic-20 Basic interpreter :-P
[00:26:51] <Lukky> 1980ish
[00:27:02] <jmer> The only computer books they had at my school library was commodore or vic-20 manuals
[00:27:08] <Lukky> haha
[00:27:09] <jmer> I borrowed them but I understood absolutely nothing
[00:27:15] <Lukky> fond memories though
[00:27:16] <jmer> and I'm from '85
[00:27:49] <jmer> Lukky: you're 10 years younger than my father xD
[00:27:56] <Lukky> hehe ;-)
[00:28:07] <Lukky> I definitely don't feel 55
[00:28:21] <Lukky> I don't know where time has gone!
[00:28:29] <gufi> to the void*
[00:28:29] <jmer> I stopped feeling older around 25.
[00:28:50] <gufi> heh i started feeling busted at 32
[00:29:30] <jmer> gufi: I can feel my body has changed in some ways but I think that's more related to bad shape than age

[00:30:50] <Lukky> Well, if you don't, you'll develop alzeimer, or some crazy shit like that...
[00:30:56] <jmer> Also one of the product owners apparantly brought a home built arcade cabinet to work today... (he built the cabinet, but hte brains is a RPI with RetroPie)

[00:33:16] <Lukky> I've seen people my age who look and act as if they're 95
[00:33:22] <gufi> SAFe is considered kinda ick to most agilists
[00:33:29] <bomb> I thought I was an adult when I was 23 lol

[00:35:38] <jmer> as long as it's the proper approach and not just BS consultants... The SCRUM master on this team used to blog for a danish IT website... I read her blogs back then, about scrum etc... I'm fairly sure she's not selling BS

[00:40:27] <Lukky> agreed
[00:40:38] <gufi> that culture gap is fucking real
[00:40:46] <jmer> Lukky: But we also have members in the phillipines
[00:40:57] <dinowilliam> I work with some Ukrainian's
[00:41:11] <jmer> I did my bachelors with two bulgarians... Really nice guys :)
[00:41:19] <Lukky> I find it difficult to work with Indian people... not too sure why... they're usually very nice, it's just that can't answer Yes, or No... they kinda wobble their heads...
[00:41:24] <jmer> And I worked with portuguese as well
[00:41:55] <jmer> dinowilliam: Oh nice, I never meat anyone from Ukraine
[00:41:55] <gufi> i prefer people who are very to the point instead of talking and talking
[00:42:49] <jmer> gufi: I've only communicated with about 25 indians through a mail chain where I needed a port opened on a VM that was hosting a sitecore installation we did for a customer... took them 3 weeks.. To do it wrong and another two to correct it
[00:42:57] <bomb> boobs nice. I want
[00:43:16] <Lukky> jmer: lol!!!
[00:43:18] <jmer> bomb: whaa?
[00:43:19] <dinowilliam> I work with Indians, Ukrainians, Americans, Mexicans and Brazilians(I'm one) nice for culture exchange, timezone are the thing that kill us sometimes
[00:43:23] <Lukky> jmer: precisely
[00:43:32] <bomb> jmer I'm being direct as gufi suggests
[00:45:35] <jmer> bomb: aah.. right xD
[00:46:18] <jmer> dinowilliam: Yeah we actually discussed this evening that maybe we need to move standups because for the ones in the phillipines it's around 4PM
[00:46:18] <bomb> so jmer what are you going to do at your new workplace? server-side stuff this time?
[00:46:40] <jmer> bomb: the job posting said "Senior backend developer with Tech lead potential"
[00:47:05] <jmer> bomb: but I will just fix whatever comes my way, I love SQL and when I said this most of the devs gave me that "finally, some DB guy" look xD
[00:47:29] <jmer> but it's a backend service related to product information
[00:48:01] <jmer> So I assume there will be some integrations between internal and external systems... They have a monolith they want to... Not directly _micro_ service, but they want to split it out into smaller services
[00:48:48] <jmer> Also they expect to hire 35 extra devs over the next year
[00:49:13] <jmer> you have to live in Denmark to not be a consultant though...
[00:49:33] <jmer> hired in as a consultant I mean
[00:51:47] <jmer> gufi: I have no frame of reference in terms of how large such sheets are
[00:51:52] <bomb> jmer oh yeah haha. industry is craving for people who have a clue about databases, and not just ORM abusers :)
[00:52:24] <jmer> bomb: I haven't worked with a DB for almost 2 years so I am a little rusty, but... That'll quickly go away once I get going ^^
[00:52:31] <gufi> heh i'm sending the measurements to a place locally to get a quote
[00:53:29] <jmer> bomb: also they use the ELK stack...
[00:53:31] <gufi> building a 6x3x3 box with about 3 inches worth of insulation then another set of sheets on the inside... may just do 2 inches of insulation
[00:53:49] <jmer> not only do they log, but they are actually doing it in a non-braindead way :D
[00:55:08] <jmer> at my (until tomororw) current job, I found3 different logging frameworks  in the same solution, none of them was used correctly.
[00:55:38] <jmer> In another solution, they had written their own homemade IoC container... Which only responsiblity was to inject Autofac... Which they then resolved dependencies from xD
[00:55:49] <jmer> but with the "service locator" antipattern
[00:56:08] <bomb> jmer ah that's what Java guys take care of
[00:56:21] <jmer> bomb: what do you mean?
[00:56:53] <jmer> gufi: what's the box for? (the Dune pain box thing comes to mind)
[00:59:14] <gufi> building a powder coating oven
[00:59:32] <jmer> What do you usually powder coat?
[00:59:38] <jmer> not you, but in general
[00:59:50] <jmer> I mean the dimensions seem kinda small for... a car fender?
[00:59:56] <gufi> car parts use it quite a bit. basically its just another kind of metal coating
[01:00:13] <gufi> nah fenders and stuff would be paint, this would be more used near the engine or higher heat areas
[01:00:40] <jmer> Så the dimensions of your powder coating oven is useful?
[01:00:44] <gufi> handles oil/fuels way better than paint
[01:00:56] <gufi> oh yea, i could easily fit 2 wheels in there at a time if i needed to even
[01:01:04] <bomb> jmer ELK stack. Java guys at your new job takes care of it, right?
[01:01:18] <bomb> or they do other stuff, like managing Hadoop clusters, configuring Spring Booth, etc?
[01:01:25] <jmer> bomb: I don't think so... the java guys handle the services/products that are built with java xD
[01:01:45] <jmer> I think everyoine is logging with ELK
[01:01:51] <bomb> jmer what's the name of the company? and what is your full name and address?
[01:02:04] <gufi> ah, bomb  being a terrorist again
[01:02:14] <jmer> bomb: urMom Underwear uR Mom's basement
[01:02:29] <bomb> she's dead
[01:02:36] <bomb> I'm sad. are you happy now?
[01:03:18] <jmer> bomb: did she die recently?
[01:04:15] * gufi has a hard time believing anything bomb says due to history
[01:05:36] <bomb> moon landing happened.
[01:06:39] <jmer> bomb: did you kill her yourself?
[01:07:42] <jmer> is it just me or is it a major footgun that BurgerKing is running a commercial on facebook claiming that people can't taste the difference between their meat based and plant based burger pattys?
[01:08:01] <jmer> (they apparantly have a 50/50 type burger with half of each)
[01:10:40] <bomb> is that really the case, though?
[01:10:43] <bomb> they taste similar?
[01:10:47] <jmer> I don't know
[01:11:00] <jmer> but is it a GOOD statement to make? "Our burger meat is so shitty it tastes like the fake stuff"
[01:11:27] <bomb> they're obviously making their way to add plant-based meat to their cuisine
[01:11:42] <bomb> but I did not see the ad personally. you might be straight out lying to our faces.

[10:41:06] <IceMichael> hi guys
[10:41:40] <IceMichael> is there a particular reason why it's very common in C# to have one class per file while in some other programming languages they put multiple classes into one file? (like e.g. Python, sometimes Go, depending on style C++, ...)
[10:42:05] <IceMichael> I love C# and I work with both C# and Python and am trying to come up with some rational on where to drive which approach... or is it just the community being used to one or the other?
[10:43:06] <Kim^J> IceMichael: Might be Java legacy
[10:43:15] <Kim^J> Which sort of enforced one class per file
[10:43:27] <Kim^J> Also, C# classes tend to be longer than most Python classes
[10:43:50] <jmer> I think it's nice
[10:43:54] <Kim^J> If the Python classes start creeping up in size, I usually split the file into one file per class
[10:43:56] <jmer> having one class pr file
[10:44:00] <Kim^J> jmer: Me too
[10:44:04] <jmer> it's orderly
[10:44:05] <jmer> :D
[10:44:05] <Kim^J> Makes it really easy to find them
[10:44:27] <IceMichael> Kim^J: yeah, I also gave a guideline to my team to split a file when it gets too large there
[10:44:41] <jmer> IceMichael: but personally I just follow whatever is the most common convention in the language I am using..
[10:44:43] <IceMichael> but C# ist more harsh here. Also thought of the Java background, but it still seems to be best/good practice in C#

[10:45:59] <Kim^J> Ugh, I'm not made for all-nighters
[10:46:04] <jmer> IceMichael: it's a convention so you could, if you were masochistic, put all your classes in one file :D
[10:59:51] <IceMichael> jmer: yeah, I mean the "finding easily" argument is a bit outdated because C# is built in a way that IDEs can help you big time here anyways
[10:59:59] <IceMichael> you can ctrl+click them and you can create auto-imports
[11:03:43] <Nasp> git reflog is such a nice tool
[11:04:10] <Nasp> I've mostly seen multiple classes per file for generated stuff
[11:04:38] <Nasp> Or for maybe a simple model or something
[11:04:38] <Nasp> Or tests
[11:04:39] <Nasp> IceMichael:  Btw what is too large?
[11:04:44] <MatthiasVance> When it tears
[11:06:52] <jmer> IceMichael: well... even if that's the case I've had trouble finding a specific class in messy solutions that didn't consistently keep 1 class pr. file...
[11:07:07] <jmer> IceMichael: it's even worse when someone sets up the project to rename the assembly to something different from the project name
[11:13:38] *** Joins: jinsun (~quassel@user/jinsun)
[11:16:43] <IceMichael> Nasp: large files? Well, hard to tell. We made a very "open" requirement to have files not exceed 1000 lines at the moment. In Python, files tend to be larger because each file is a module/namespace with implications for the length of the import statement, too
[11:16:50] <IceMichael> in Python, that said
[11:17:26] <IceMichael> I mean, yes, some internal or auxiliary classes or if cohesion is very strong might also go to one file in C#, also seen that. But oftentimes it seems one class per file, still
[11:18:07] <IceMichael> jmer: ah, ctrl+click does not work reliably then?
[11:18:28] <IceMichael> or are you referring to a class where you also did not know the place of references to it?

[11:33:17] <Kim^J> Heh, grep handles that well even on spinning rust.
[11:33:35] <Inge> but yeah, sometimes from inside vs, and sometimes grep via WSL. Now if only I could get WSL2 to work in this windows VM on an AMD CPU ...
[11:34:07] <Diablo-D3> wsl2 works fine on amd.
[11:34:16] <jmer> canton7: I think this was a case of two slutions where one loaded assemblies from the other with Assembly.Load so using Go To Type was of limited use (because the type was defined in Solution B, but only used in Soltuion A after Assembly.Load)... or some such nonsense... Either way, having a clean solution structure is preferable :P

[11:36:10] <Diablo-D3> Kim^J: its supported if your cpu does

[11:36:31] <Nasp> Usually disabled for security reasons i think
[11:36:55] <Diablo-D3> it just needs to support slat and ept/npt

[11:38:34] <Diablo-D3> Inge: which is odd, since I already know people who run hyperv inside of linux hosts and have been doing it for awhile
[11:38:36] <Diablo-D3> on amd cpus
[11:39:00] <Diablo-D3> oh, that shipped in 202H apparently

[12:11:28] <MaNa3k> or will that give framework error
[12:11:45] <MatthiasVance> MaNa3k: Seems easy to try out?
[12:12:22] <MaNa3k> MatthiasVance, yes i could just try, but just want to know even if it works, if im not digging my own grave on the long run
[12:12:50] <sysRPL> welp, i ordered a pi zero 2 w
[12:13:01] <Babbage> that SAFe diagram made me shiver
[12:13:14] <MatthiasVance> Babbage: Yeah!
[12:13:19] <jmer> Babbage: doesn't seem very agile xD
[12:13:39] <MatthiasVance> sysRPL: I was looking into getting some rbpis earlier but they seemed to be getting 4 times as expensive or something
[12:13:47] <Babbage> sounds like our place
[12:13:50] <sysRPL> $15
[12:14:03] <Babbage> and any innovation from us devs/engineers, which used to happen all the time, is litterally stamped down on
[12:14:04] <sysRPL> + $7 shipping
[12:14:05] <Babbage> when I say literally
[12:14:07] <jmer> this new work place of mine is really embracing agile... The team has a lot of say about decisions with the product and how it's made... And apparantly they've had success with it to the point they are now being used as the good example for the rest of the org...
[12:14:14] <MatthiasVance> sysRPL: Yeah it seems even the newest model is only $35
[12:14:14] <Babbage> i did a presentation a while ago to manager and head on some ideas
[12:14:16] <Babbage> they loved them
[12:14:27] <MatthiasVance> sysRPL: Might be when I tried to buy it / ship it "here"
[12:14:30] <Babbage> they then asked me to never talk about them and present them to the department they were for
[12:14:47] <Babbage> because we dont dictate requirement, it has to `come from them` and they politically didnt want me creating any work
[12:14:59] <sysRPL> MatthiasVance: i am not sure desktop pis make much sense other than as octoprint server
[12:15:08] <jmer> Babbage: any time "politics" are used for decisions I want to kick someone in the face
[12:15:13] <MatthiasVance> sysRPL: Yeah I was looking into running HomeAssistant or something
[12:15:25] <Babbage> jmer: :)
[12:15:32] <sysRPL> they are not good as a desktop computer IMO, but the zero line is good for electronics / services
[12:16:01] <Nasp> Anyone with Kafka experience?
[12:16:38] <sysRPL> MatthiasVance: well this never pi zero 2 w will now run dotnet core, so i suppose if anyone here bought on of those a $15 they could use it as a dotnet core platform for any number of service oriented apps
[12:17:20] <Babbage> I wonder if SAFe is what they are trying to do here without telling us
[12:17:28] <Babbage> we had a load of managers go on an `agile training course`
[12:17:34] <Babbage> (note no actual agile stuff happens here)
[12:18:15] <Babbage> it smells of marketing `agile` to make some consultants lots of money, and suddenly a mass of missued terms here by management and agile like a puddle of sinking sand
[12:18:30] <sysRPL> i made an led wall for one of my pi zeros -> https://cache.getlazarus.org/images/led-matrix.jpg
[12:19:05] <sysRPL> a small led wall
[12:19:09] <MatthiasVance> Babbage: Ah yeah "oh it seems like you're not applying it right"
[12:19:10] <jmer> Babbage: the article I linked earlier (And other articles from the same source) basically explain SAFe that way xD
[12:25:55] <sysRPL> is anyone here familiar with glBlendFunc? i was going to write some custom blending functions, but am a bit confused and need clarifiaction

[13:47:04] <eurogos> excuse my sausage fingers

[13:48:00] <eurogos> yeah, bit how to get access from inside the configure services? can I still access injected services from there?

[13:49:37] <planetcall|work> there should be good examples with sample code for using injected IHttpClientFactory when bootstrapping OpenIdConnect
[13:52:50] <MaNa3k> how the fuck are normal people able to walk "1000000 steps" in 6 weeks
[13:53:02] <MaNa3k> we have this contest going at work

[13:54:19] <Kim^J> A bit much, but not unachieable
[13:54:28] <MaNa3k> in 6 weeks
[13:55:11] <Kim^J> MaNa3k: Well, start walking? :P
[13:56:08] <Kim^J> Me and my gf aimed for 10k/day earlier this year. Walking the kids to daycare, visit the store and you had like 8k
[13:58:17] <Kim^J> unachievable*
[13:58:23] <Kim^J> That spelling.
[13:59:18] <MaNa3k> mhm
[13:59:35] <MaNa3k> not achievable by me lol
[13:59:54] <MaNa3k> maybe one day in a year lol :P
[13:59:57] <Kim^J> Why?
[14:01:13] <MaNa3k> because i hate walking
[14:03:11] <eurogos> you need a standing desk and a treadmill
[14:03:54] <jmer> If it weren't because of the limit on time I would prefer walking as a form of excercise over anything else xD
[14:04:14] <Kim^J> Walking is quite enjoyable
[14:04:19] <jmer> I have an ambition about starting running again after we move
[14:04:27] <Kim^J> You just put on shoes, goes outside and do it :P
[14:04:57] <jmer> Kim^J: I'm hoping having a garden will also motivate me to get out more... I've considdereed getting some logs and then splitting them manually with an axe as a form of excersise
[14:06:20] <Nasp> eurogos:  I think you can get it from the context
[14:06:22] <eurogos> very lumbersexual
[14:06:43] <eurogos> Nasp, like this -> var _httpClientFactory = context.HttpContext.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<IHttpClientFactory>();
[14:06:50] <Nasp> Yes
[14:07:02] <eurogos> phew, easier than I thought
[14:07:16] <Nasp> Looks quite a lot like our code
[14:07:22] <Nasp> But i would assume a lot of auth does
[14:07:26] <Nasp> What is it you need to call
[14:08:47] <eurogos> this is one of many BFF apps which share a single identity server, I need to pass back to the identity server some info about which app called it
[14:09:11] <eurogos> like logo, name, support email address
[14:11:00] <jmer> whenever I see BFF I can't help but mentally translate it to "Best Friends Forever"
[14:11:51] <jmer> eurogos: btw not sure it's lumbersexual, there's a fireplace both inside and outside so we will need the wood sooner or late :P
[14:12:48] <eurogos> i had to implement an awkward reverse proxy in the bff so it is definitely NOT my best friend
[14:13:09] <Kim^J> jmer: It has the added benefit of disposing rage :D
[14:13:16] <Kim^J> Just whack that log as hard as you can :D
[14:13:29] <Kim^J> Also, sharpening tools is nice
[14:13:31] <Kim^J> Soothes the mind

[14:19:10] <eurogos> Windirstat
[14:19:25] <MaNa2k> eurogos,  ah thats the one, thanks
[14:19:50] <jmer> kinda odd you need an app for that imho
[14:19:58] <jmer> windows should be able to show this to you by default.
[14:20:13] <MaNa2k> well i got only 18gb left, and i cant figure out whats taking all the space.
[14:20:16] <eurogos> jmer, it makes sense tbh
[14:20:19] <Nasp> eurogos:  Auth is the worst :D
[14:20:27] <MaNa2k> only got 256gb :(
[14:20:29] <eurogos> i hate all auth
[14:20:30] <MaNa2k> ssd
[14:20:32] <MaNa2k> nvme i think
[14:20:44] <Nasp> eurogos:  I was planning on doing the opposite, convert a cookie to oauth token
[14:22:45] <Nasp> Or maybe that's what you meant
[14:25:48] <eurogos> maybe... the spa authenticates with the bff using cookies. The spa needs to get its data from APIs. The spa sends its api request to the bff which proxies the request to the API server and in the process, uses an oauth token thats stored in the bff session
[14:25:53] <bomb> I really love corns
[14:29:03] <MaNa2k> can i just delete all the  core sdk 2.1.xxx

[14:30:06] <MaNa2k> before core 3.1 we were on framework 4.x
[14:32:34] <Nasp> We are going .NET 4.8 -> .NET 5
[14:32:37] <Nasp> It's not exactly easy
[14:32:52] <MaNa2k> Nasp, 5 isnt lts
[14:33:05] <MaNa2k> Nasp, 6 is right around corner
[14:33:13] <Nasp> So what
[14:33:17] <MaNa2k> 6 is on rc2
[14:33:17] <Nasp> Not like it matters
[14:33:26] <Nasp> LTs or not
[14:33:30] <MaNa2k> mhm
[14:33:49] <MaNa2k> you might have problems when your faviroite nugets starts depricating stuff on 5
[14:34:00] <MaNa2k> which is whats happening for us because we still on 3.1
[14:34:04] <Nasp> Then we just upgrade
[14:34:14] <Nasp> But i dont see the point in targeting something taht isn't released yet
[14:34:25] <MaNa2k> we got like over 100 projects in same solution, not easy for us
[14:34:30] <eurogos> i did 4.8 to 3.1 (including ef6 to ef core) and it was a nightmare
[14:34:33] <Nasp> WE are on 4.8 the package are fucking old and .NET 5 will allow us to update em
[14:34:37] <Nasp> MaNa2k: Same
[14:34:49] <Nasp> And 200 controllers that needs to be migrated
[14:34:56] <Kim^J> I upgraded .NET to Python, works flawlessly!
[14:34:59] <MaNa2k> mhm
[14:35:27] <Nasp> Worst part is all auth stuff
[14:35:29] <Nasp> Takes forever
[14:35:37] <Nasp> Too much custom crap, and just layers upon layers
[14:35:39] <MaNa2k> we were mostly on console apps, no mvc, and shit old aspx with masterpages
[14:36:16] <MaNa2k> now mostly, functions, some webjobs, mvc, blazor, on 3.1
[14:36:29] <Nasp> Only 20 or so webjobs
[14:36:34] <Nasp> But they don't require anything
[14:36:46] <MaNa2k> we decieved to migrate webjobs to functiontimers
[14:36:47] <Nasp> The most annoying thins is people named them "WebJobs"
[14:36:50] <MaNa2k> *decieded
[14:37:01] <MaNa2k> Nasp, yea i hate that lol
[14:37:36] <Nasp> Well i just want to throw the webjobs into our existing cluster
[14:37:40] <Nasp> But that's like a year or so away
[14:37:56] <MaNa2k> cluster?
[14:38:10] <MaNa2k> oh you mean on .net 5
[14:38:29] <Nasp> Yeah once it's migrated
[14:38:34] <Nasp> We have an existing docker cluster
[14:38:37] <Nasp> Where we run everything else
[14:38:44] <Nasp> Except the monolith
[14:39:33] <Nasp> I just still haven't quite found out how i should do routing when i migrate it
[14:39:44] <Nasp> Since we currently just have a single fucking route table with thousand or lines
[14:39:55] <Nasp> And i wanna get rid of it, but it might be better not to change too much in the migration phase
[14:39:58] <Nasp> But it's still just fucking huge
[14:40:09] <MaNa2k> lol we still havnt gotten around on using pipelies for ci\cd. we were suppose to do that a year ago or something lol
[14:40:42] <MaNa2k> shit moves slowely ever since we migrated shit to azure
[14:41:04] <Nasp> We are migrating shit away from Azure :d
[14:41:30] <Nasp> The funny part is we have our cluster running in azure, and postgres
[14:41:38] <Nasp> And postgres is in google
[14:41:46] <Nasp> The monolith is hosted at gcloud, but it's database is in Azure
[14:42:01] <Nasp> So whenever any action is done, there's like 10 request going between Azure and google datacenters
[14:42:57] <MaNa2k> lol

[14:56:00] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: What's up?
[14:56:16] <Tobbi_> A lot of different stuff today that's annoying.
[14:57:44] <Tobbi_> a) I forgot to inform our customer about a change that was on their production system (that came with the new software)
[14:57:58] <Tobbi_> b) there are duplicate entries in the database and we had no idea where they came from until now.
[14:58:05] <Tobbi_> c) the above.
[14:58:10] <Tobbi_> d) I'm hungry and want to get something to eat.
[14:58:37] <MatthiasVance> ah shit
[14:58:42] <MatthiasVance> start at D and work your way up!
[14:58:48] <Tobbi_> yeah, I should.
[14:59:10] <Tobbi_> Oh, I forgot e) customer asked why certain changes aren't on their production systems...I told them because I asked for them to approve update in their entirety.
[14:59:14] <Tobbi_> And not single changes.
[14:59:21] <Tobbi_> Because that leads to my git history to be corrupted.
[14:59:46] <MaNa2k> i wonder if i can delete the hiberfil.sys file
[14:59:50] <MaNa2k> its huge

[15:02:05] <MaNa2k> between ram and hdd
[15:02:08] <MatthiasVance> Tobbi_: Ahh okay, so no team :(
[15:02:12] <Tobbi_> Nope.
[15:02:16] <MatthiasVance> Wouldn't it be nicer to work with more people?
[15:02:28] <Tobbi_> More people means more structure and less freedom IMO
[15:02:39] <MatthiasVance> Usually, true
[15:02:49] <MatthiasVance> Might also mean less stress :D
[15:02:56] <MatthiasVance> Since not everything falls on you
[15:03:07] <Tobbi_> It's usually alright.
[15:03:13] <MatthiasVance> ahh okay, good

[15:14:50] <Kim^J> Anyway, running your own hardware sucks. A lot.
[15:15:08] <Kim^J> Running just a hypervisor on that hardware sucks less.
[15:15:13] <Kim^J> But can still suck a lot.
[15:15:23] <Nasp> What part of it would suck?
[15:15:29] <bomb> jmer deg jeg veks geg dejk seg

[15:15:45] <jmer> bomb: stop drooling
[15:15:46] <Kim^J> Nasp: Stuff breaks. All the time. Everything is incompatible
[15:16:02] <bomb> it was a poetry in old Danish, you turd
[15:16:15] <Nasp> Well i would probably still rent it somewhere
[15:16:21] <Nasp> Like hetzner or the likes
[15:16:47] <Kim^J> Nasp: As someone who runs multiple datacenters, just buy a VPS.
[15:17:06] <Nasp> Well i would like to skip the virtual part
[15:17:12] <Kim^J> Why?
[15:17:35] <Nasp> Because usually VPS means shared
[15:17:51] <Kim^J> Stop using crappy providers.
[15:18:10] <Kim^J> We have multiple customers that have their own cluster.
[15:18:39] <Kim^J> And they are free to create any policy they want, such as running VM X only on device A, B or C.
[15:18:41] <Nasp> I just want to take some normal hardware and see how our shit runs
[15:18:50] <Nasp> Since i have a feeling it would run like 20 x faster
[15:19:07] <Kim^J> What are you running it on now?
[15:19:07] <Nasp> But some of it might also be the reason one of my collegues doesn't like multuple cores
[15:19:12] <Nasp> 2 core servers
[15:19:19] <Nasp> "server"
[15:19:22] <Kim^J> VPS?
[15:19:45] <Nasp> VMs so kinda
[15:20:17] <Kim^J> Which provider? Public cloud providers?
[15:21:01] <Nasp> Azure
[15:21:25] <Kim^J> In Germany?
[15:21:32] <Nasp> Amsterdam
[15:21:35] <Nasp> And Ireland
[15:22:35] <bomb> https://www.sluhosting.com/
[15:22:45] <Kim^J> Heh, so you likely have latency issues
[15:23:08] <Kim^J> Did you check performance charts if the machines are struggling?
[15:25:21] <irwiss> Nasp: it's also usually "vcores" with arbitrarily sliced time shares, all kinds of bullshit "credits" systems etc
[15:25:37] <Nasp> Kim^J:  Why do we have latency issues?
[15:25:51] <Nasp> irwiss:  Yup it is
[15:26:18] <Kim^J> Because those regions are 20-40ms away
[15:27:43] <Kim^J> Apparently there's Azure in Norway.
[15:28:45] <Seng> But Azure is expensive! :(
[15:29:06] <Kim^J> Seng: Compared to what?
[15:29:19] <Seng> AWS, and Hetzner
[15:29:53] <Seng> when it comes to VPS's at least. I know there's more than just one service provided by them all :)
[15:30:05] <bomb> yeah, Hetzner's VMs are good
[15:30:13] <bomb> Leaseweb's dedis are better
[15:30:19] <bomb> OVH... run away
[15:30:27] <Seng> Kimsufi?! YES PLEASE.
[15:30:39] <bomb> Kimsufi is OVH XD

[15:41:30] <MaNa2k> ligatures just confuse me, which is why i dont like fira coda
[15:41:55] <MaNa2k> i meanm they make perfectly sense, but i have to think twice

[16:41:29] <bomb> I put Roboto Mono on my ITT Schaub Lorenz television from 1970s, and it renders just perfectly

[19:04:48] <MatthiasVance> ahh
[19:04:57] <jmer> so he was open to seeing if we could change that to a noraml 1GBit
[19:05:03] <MatthiasVance> oh that's good
[19:05:10] <jmer> he has the same problem himself xD
[19:05:31] <jmer> because who the fuck wants a 2-300 MBits xD

[19:09:55] <jonp> which, fair.  very fair, and i entirely agree.
[19:10:38] <jmer> jonp: ... well that is true xD
[19:11:03] <jonp> you could get an Android phone and still have the same multi-device "problem"
[19:11:09] <jmer> that's true
[19:11:37] <jmer> But at least then I wouldn't have to switch between two systems...
[19:11:40] <MatthiasVance> jmer: Why would IT need access to your phone btw?
[19:11:52] <jmer> MatthiasVance: I just assume that if it's enrolled int heir MDM they can see everything
[19:12:00] <MatthiasVance> In the past I have been able to just get the instructions for those things and configure it myself
[19:12:04] <jonp> jmer: they claim that's not true, and i'm not sure i believe them.
[19:12:16] <jonp> MatthiasVance: because your phone may have corporate "secrets" -- email, etc.
[19:12:18] <KNERD> or get the older regular PinePhone   https://pine64.com/product/pinephone-beta-edition-with-convergence-package/
[19:12:26] <jonp> and if you lose your device, they want to be able to NUKE IT FROM ORBIT
[19:12:32] <jonp> TRADE SECRETS
[19:12:35] <MatthiasVance> jonp: No I get requiring MDM
[19:12:45] <MatthiasVance> jonp: I mean why do they need access to your phone to set it up, can't you to it yourself?
[19:12:53] <jmer> One of the teammembers I spoke with yesterday told me it's rather aggressive, like they ban onedrive, google drive, dropbox etc.
[19:12:54] <jonp> i missed that part of the conversation
[19:13:14] <jmer> and if you install those apps, you get a popup that says "you've installed a blocked app, remove it from your phone or we will wipe it in 48 hours"
[19:13:21] <MatthiasVance> Ohh lol
[19:13:29] <MatthiasVance> Definitely don't want that to be your personal device then yeah

[19:18:29] <MatthiasVance> Why do you need all that work stuff on your phone anyway
[19:18:57] <MatthiasVance> Employers expect you to have a mail client on your phone? Why?
[19:19:05] <jmer> because I think it's nice to be able to answer a work email from it on ce in a while MatthiasVance  :P

[19:20:23] <KNERD> In Mexico , they sell very basic brick phones with minimal apps alreayd installed for about $15 USD
[19:20:25] <MatthiasVance> "as much as possible" results in "carrying two phones"

[19:21:34] <MatthiasVance> okay
[19:21:38] <jmer> MatthiasVance: so I need a work phone. so I can ignore it when I have time off
[19:21:39] <MatthiasVance> That's why I asked

[21:26:06] <DevJohnC> it's probably because of the way async void operates; you can't await the task (because void is returned) so you can't observe exceptions directly
[21:32:07] <canton7> Normally they get rethrown on the ThreadPool on that case, and crash your app. AsyncRelayCommand must be swallowing them
[21:32:44] <MapMan> check the github link, Serio0694 explains this in detail. canton7 is correct, the lib is explicitly swallowing those exceptions.
[21:33:00] <MapMan> Otherwise they would be rethrown on the threadpool and crash the app like canton7 said
[21:33:13] <MapMan> (which is what I expected)

[23:11:28] <brianonymous> i swear it feels like i have a cancellation token that is leaky in a tcpclient readasync
[23:12:30] <DevJohnC> leaky in what regard?
[23:13:17] <brianonymous> thats what i am having trouble figuring out... its such a slooooow leak.. and when i attempt to profile it looks like its keeping callbacknodes and callback partitions in mem
[23:13:37] <brianonymous> but i have yet to really definitively prove it
[23:13:50] <DevJohnC> well, CancellationToken is a value type
[23:13:58] <brianonymous> yeah
[23:14:04] <DevJohnC> if you have a CancellationTokenSource make sure you're disposing it when done
[23:14:09] <brianonymous> i think that the tcpclient routines fire up a register against it
[23:14:53] <brianonymous> its a long lived single source that actually rarely cancels.. thats the other odd bit
