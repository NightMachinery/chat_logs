[02:53:05] <Joanna> Thanks for the info about spoofing. I had to go afk after asking. Isn’t there already a way to prevent spoofing of ip addresses by using better packet inspection? If it is a voip call can’t the ip that the call is originating from be detected somehow?
[02:55:39] <Joanna> I was listening to a story on darknet diaries podcast and it seems like they emergency dispatch people don’t even bother calling back the phone number to see if it’s real before sending troops.
[02:56:58] <Joanna> Given that it could be possible that the real owner of the phone number might not answer is still worth a try and they don’t seem to do it.

[03:08:37] <Joanna> It seems like the phone completely should have records of whether a phone called emergency services and aren’t voip phones not allowed to call emergency services? I’ve never tried it but Skype says you can’t use it to call 911
[03:18:05] <Joanna> I wonder if the emergency people could try calling the number given when the call first starts to verify if it’s real.that would be fairly simple to do.  No need to even modify the phone system.
[03:19:40] <Joanna> The number or spoofed number shows up on their call tracking software so it should be easy to call it right back
[03:27:04] <Joanna> Most true emergency calls are probably someone asking for help not someone bragging about committing a crime.

[05:26:42] <Joanna> I think it’s possible to interrupt a phone call in progress with a new call maybe no need to disconnect the caller just call back the number calling in and make new connection
[05:28:53] <Joanna> So in that way if nobody is at the phone number being spoofed they would know it’s faked or if a different person who didn’t make is at the phone number being spoofed they would also know it’s a prank
[05:30:36] <Joanna> It just amazes me how nobody thinks of these simple things that can be done.

[06:34:40] <joe7057> unfortunately I cannot chat right now, real life calls. But I look forward to seeing interesting discussions in this channel. I tend to enjoy thinking about the issues that come up with opsec.
[06:34:49] <joe7057> have a good day/night/whatever it is there.
[06:41:25] <Joanna> Sure:) see you later

[16:03:08] <jan6> well, if nothing else, it
[16:03:13] <jan6> it'd add a ton of latency
[16:03:35] <jan6> that, and voip usually goes over UDP anyway, so there's no specific "packets" anyway
[16:04:24] <jan6> UDP has datagrams, which would just be "here's some data" instead of "here's the data that follows packet X, this packet's checksum is Y"
