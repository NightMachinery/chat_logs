[15:51:42] <fendor[m]> maerwald, what do you say to rolling out the pre-release to VSCode Marketplace only for now?
[15:52:00] <maerwald> only for now?
[15:52:55] <fendor[m]> well, ideally either jasper performs the pre-release for VSX, or the github action we use adds support for VSX
[15:53:27] <fendor[m]> either way, we want to release to VSX as well, asap,  but this way we get some (although skewed) feedback
[15:53:46] <fendor[m]> esp with respect to bug reprots
[15:58:35] <maerwald> sure
[16:07:42] <fendor[m]> Ok, I am going to use the announcement we wrote and adapt it slightly for pre-release to make clear, this is not a proper release yet
[16:07:53] <fendor[m]> https://hackmd.io/@H5m3j9VQRsiiBdVxBmOCiA/S11w7XqG5/edit if you want to check
[16:08:00] <maerwald> will it show up here? https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell
[16:08:10] <fendor[m]> yeah, it should
[16:08:22] <fendor[m]> (not yet, but when I created the release)
[16:16:27] <fendor[m]> ok, last call before the pre-release, anyone has issues with the announcement text? I added a disclaimer on how to use the pre-release and that VSX doesn't work atm. Also added the cool `toolchain` setting to the list of new settings
[16:17:56] <fendor[m]> in 15 minutes, I will do the pre-release
[16:25:42] <maerwald> fendor[m]: I removed installStack/installCabal/installGHC afair
[16:25:49] <maerwald> so that's not correct anymore
[16:27:57] <fendor[m]> huh, I missed that. Thank you!
[16:29:21] <maerwald> https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell#setting-a-specific-toolchain
[16:29:23] <maerwald> is the new way
[16:30:17] <fendor[m]> Yeah, for some reason I thought that both settings existed but it makes sense that we only have the latter now. Afaict, that option is less discoverable, though
[16:30:35] <fendor[m]> because it isn't listed in the settings paged
[16:30:48] <maerwald> it's listed under configuration options
[16:47:17] <fendor[m]> ok nice, going to do the pre-release now and hope nothing breaks ðŸ™‚
[16:59:19] <fendor[m]> obligatory MR for version bumps: https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/pull/569
[17:15:25] <maerwald> fendor[m]: https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/runs/5833687475?check_suite_focus=true
[17:15:52] <fendor[m]> yeah I just noticed 
[17:15:54] <maerwald> that's why I'm not a fan of automatic releases
[17:16:00] <maerwald> it wastes more time than it saves
[17:16:19] <fendor[m]> once figured out, I think it can save some time
[17:16:35] <fendor[m]> anyway, the issue is that the tag is named `2.0.0-alpha` instead of the expected name `2.0.0` 
[17:17:49] <fendor[m]> although I don't quite understand why

[18:17:44] <fendor[m]> At long last: https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/pull/570
[18:38:01] <fendor[m]> It is published
[18:38:03] <fendor[m]> https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell
[18:38:24] <maerwald> are you sure that's a pre-release
[18:38:34] <fendor[m]> no
[18:38:51] <fendor[m]> But on the overview, it still claims v1.8.0 is the current version
[18:38:54] <fendor[m]> so, hopefully
[18:39:05] <fendor[m]> we will know in a couple of minuts
[18:39:32] <fendor[m]> actually, I am going to check in VSCode

[18:53:21] <fendor[m]> Hm, the README is at least updated...
[18:57:19] <fendor[m]> maerwald, it is a pre-release ðŸ™‚ Starting the reddit / discourse announcements
[18:57:32] <maerwald> https://imgur.com/9C0tJWP.png
[18:58:12] <fendor[m]> perfect, everything working as intended
[18:58:25] <fendor[m]> (so far)
[18:59:40] <fendor[m]> https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ann-pre-release-vscode-haskell-2-0-0/4338 and https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/tww8ku/ann_prerelease_vscodehaskell_200/
[18:59:46] <fendor[m]> let the issues flood in
[19:01:30] <maerwald> prolly none... well, the most common issue will be that `haskell-language-server-wrapper --project-ghc` doesn't work when the project GHC is not installed
[19:03:12] <fendor[m]> Hopefully none. We should be able to improve some of the error messages though
