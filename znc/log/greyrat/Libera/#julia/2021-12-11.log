[11:25:45] <mikko> is there a better way to do "a .&= (b .== false)" with bitmatrices?
[11:27:00] <mikko> "~.(b)" didn't seem to work (ok i'm not sure if that's any better either)
[11:29:40] <mikko> a .-= b kind of does the same thing but it gets angery if trying to subtract true from false :[

[20:21:13] <^[> mikko: I think you meant `a .&= .~b`, which seems to work, but `a .&= .!b` feels slightly more appropriate.
[20:21:58] <^[> There's also `@. a &= !b`, which is possibly slightly more readable.
[20:23:20] <mikko> ^[: thanks! i guess i just had . in the wrong place for the unary function
[20:23:48] <mikko> also i wasn't aware of @., that's nice
