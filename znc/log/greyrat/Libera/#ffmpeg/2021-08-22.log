[00:29:52] <edman007_> Hey,  is anyone here familar with mp4 (like the details?), I have an app that is using ffmpeg to write mp4 files for HLS, and chrome/firefox keep saying my stuff is bad...so I'm at debug builds of chrome to figure out why and leaned that it's failing at converting AVC to AnnexB...
[00:30:21] <edman007_> I'm trying to figure out what that's supposed to be, and who my ffmpeg generated MP4 files would cause chromium to fail on that
[00:39:44] <JEEB> annex b is how H.264 is usually saved in raw files (literally comes from annex b of H.264/14496-10)
[00:40:01] <JEEB> which is either a three or four byte start code plus the NAL unit
[00:40:12] <JEEB> while in mp4 the contents are usually saved differently
[00:40:37] <JEEB> a sample consists of size of packet, and then the NAL unit data
[00:41:28] <JEEB> so apparently chromium is trying to convert from that mp4 style (usually called AVCc or so) to the annex B style
[00:41:32] <JEEB> and is failing
[00:42:11] <JEEB> probably converting to feed to a hw decoder or so?

[01:07:24] <edman007_> do you know what the error "Unexpected NALU type 18" might mean?
[01:08:02] <JEEB> NALU are the general packet units (U is unit) in H.264
[01:08:12] <JEEB> each NALU has a type identifier
[01:08:19] <JEEB> so it literally says "lol I have no idea what 18 is"
[01:08:27] <JEEB> or it came in an unexpected location
[01:08:47] <JEEB> looking at the spec
[01:08:54] <JEEB> 17 to 18 are "reserved"
[01:09:20] <JEEB> so it might be that the stream is malformed in a sense where it's reading something completely different as that 18
[01:09:35] <edman007_> Ahh, that makes sense...
[01:09:55] <JEEB> or the application generating that stream decided to insert an actual nal unit type = 18 NALU :P
[01:12:27] <edman007_> And I guess I need to figure out what's wrong in my application that's causing that...
[01:13:17] <JEEB> well, can ffmpeg.c decode the stuff is the first thing
[01:13:30] <JEEB> `ffmpeg -v verbose -i INPUT -map 0:v -f null -`
[01:13:40] <JEEB> that will just push your input, select the video stream from it
[01:13:43] <JEEB> and attempt to decode it
[01:14:12] <JEEB> note that FFmpeg does support actually noncompliant streams in various cases
[01:14:22] <JEEB> like it might f.ex. support Annex B in MP4 even though technically it's not valid
[01:14:49] <JEEB> but it should give an answer of "is it generally decode'able?"

[07:31:14] <AntonioPt> because i see 3 or 4 ffplay
[07:31:23] <AntonioPt> let me check it
[07:31:35] <furq> or just use mpv or something that actually supports playlists
[07:31:44] <AntonioPt> right right

[07:34:59] <gnoo> pkill -9 ffplay
[07:35:22] <furq> that will just spawn another ffplay
[07:35:28] <furq> at least until the loop ends
[07:35:33] <gnoo> or if you see a `shuf` process, kill that first
[07:35:44] <AntonioPt> let me test it
[07:36:04] <AntonioPt> no ps -o ppid=$(pgrep ffplay) | while read p ; do kill "$p" ffplay ; done didnt work lol
[07:36:29] <gnoo> pkill -9 shuf first
[07:37:02] <AntonioPt> pkill -9 ffplay ?
[07:37:11] <gnoo> (if the playlist is large enough, it will be buffered and shuf's output is held. in that case, killing all ffplay will just create new ones)
[07:37:37] <furq> kill -9 $(ps -o ppid=$(pgrep ffplay))
[07:38:07] <AntonioPt> didnt work furq
[07:38:24] <AntonioPt> yes gnoo its a bit large lol
[07:38:49] <gnoo> you ran that from a terminal no? can you kill that?
[07:39:43] <AntonioPt>  pkill -9 shuf first this gnoo ? yes and didnt do nuthing and the command that furq  give me didnt work too
[07:40:57] <gnoo> just nuke that terminal, should kill all child processes
[07:41:07] <furq> lol
[07:41:44] <AntonioPt> gonna reboot
[07:41:56] <AntonioPt> best option i guess
[07:42:34] <furq> i don't think ffplay would detach but i don't really know
[07:42:40] <furq> ffplay is more for debugging than anything else
[07:42:50] <gnoo> even if it is, only one would at a time

[11:53:43] <acagastya> Hi, I did `ffmpeg -i foo.flac -acodec alac bar.m4a` and I get `width not divisible by 2 (1673x1493)`.  Any idea how to fix that?

[20:17:38] <kepstin> acagastya: it's probably trying to encode an embedded cover art image as a video stream. Easiest workaround is to add the "-vn" option to tell it not to do video stuff.
[20:20:56] <acagastya> kepstin -- will that mean the cover art won't be embedded in the m4a, then?
[20:22:21] <kepstin> yes. it's possible to keep the cover art, but the command's a bit more complicated
[20:23:01] <kepstin> I *think* you'd want to do "ffmpeg -i foo.flac -disposition:v attached_pic -c:v copy -c:a alac output.m4a"
