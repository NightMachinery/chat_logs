[00:01:53] <af> can someone explain what is the scope of cjdns with regards to what packets flow where? is it just dns resolution? if all traffic is supposed to go through it, how does the routing work exactly?
[00:02:09] <hoistbypetard> (I habitually include the link to an answer when I use it in code, even if I don’t copy/paste directly, just so I can reference the discussion when I steal from myself later)
[00:02:25] <af> what I mean is, what is the bgp equivalent of cjdns?
[00:02:25] <demize> For starters, cjdns has nothing to do with DNS.
[00:03:15] <riv> :O
[00:03:35] <demize> It's essentially just an encrypted overlay network that uses a DHT for storing routes.
[00:04:47] <af> demize: so if I install and enable the cjdns service on my machine, name resolution of example.com and traffic to regular IPs goes the same way unaffected, right?
[00:05:15] <demize> Yes.
[00:05:21] *** Joins: cmr_ (~cmr@212.102.47.66)

[01:03:33] <daegalus> Wanted to get some feedback. Do you think there is enough interest in a device that handles only messaging, over LoRA, Wifi, BT, LTE, etc? Like primarily direct messaging, but maybe support for things like FB Messenger,Whatsapp, Signal, Telegram, etc. maybe Email? I remember a device like Peek but with more connection protocols and services?

[01:52:57] <manicennui> daegalus: I think many people would like such a device, but you can't really make one for much less than a cheap smartphone, which can also do all that.
[01:54:20] <manicennui> I also think many people would like that, plus one or two additional apps.
[01:54:25] *** Joins: Seirdy (~Seirdy@sourcehut/user/seirdy)
[01:54:29] <manicennui> But different people want different apps.
[01:54:31] <daegalus> Yes, but usually much slower, less optimized, much lower battery life, and other factors. This could also be a great device for kids without giving them a full smartphone
[01:54:35] <manicennui> So again, might as well get a smartphone.
[01:55:11] <manicennui> daegalus: There are actually cheap smartphones with much better battery life. Motorola for instance makes one that is more focused on battery life.
[01:55:41] <badtuple> I would have loved a device like that at various points in life, but because of work (Slack, Pagerduty, Outlook, etc.) I don't think it'd be possible for me to replace my phone with it and so the phone will just win out.
[01:55:52] <manicennui> Also, for whatever reason, the people I know who have problems with battery life all use FB and I do not and generally have okay battery life.
[01:55:52] <badtuple> limited pocket space you see
[01:55:56] <bsandro> maybe if aim at tinkerers first it will catch up with general public later, like raspberry pi did
[01:56:41] <varjag> so you kinda want a… pda?
[01:57:11] <manicennui> The Blackberry was arguably the best iteration of that idea.
[01:57:22] <manicennui> For many users.
[01:57:31] <badtuple> Hmmm, if I could program it/lock it down then a friend would have had a usecase for it as a way to key into an airbnb.
[01:57:37] <daegalus> Slack/pagerduty/etc can have just a Pushover or some kind of notifications hub. Can't message but still get alerted?. Anyways it was just a stray thought/idea. I can always go back to designing my email alternative, because that's got just as little likelihood of getting adopted
[01:58:45] <daegalus> Well there is now a blackberry knockoff from that company that makes the Atom. Plus hacker news has a post just now of an off the grid messenger built on an old blackberry
[01:59:18] *** Quits: alpernebbi (~quassel@user/alpernebbi) (Quit: alpernebbi)
[01:59:40] <manicennui> Part of the key to the Blackberry's success was their integration with shit like Exchange and their security (whether justified or not).
[02:00:00] <manicennui> They sold large companies and governments on it.
[02:01:29] <badtuple> I feel like if you ditch the idea of apps entirely and just have a skinnable message interface then people would use it for server controlled key access, ordering food from the interface, being able to punch commands in to various things, etc.
[02:02:17] <badtuple> So you can choose how it broadcasts and where it goes and just get a generic keyboard/programmable buttons people can press. That would have a ton of use cases and stop people from re-inventing the wheel.
[02:04:13] <manicennui> You mean like WeChat is used in other countries?
[02:04:16] <daegalus> I mean, that's what I was thinking, even for third party messaging. I wasn't thinking of apps themselves. Just a target to a message syatem
[02:04:18] <badtuple> Also, just learned we're getting a show based on Asimov's Foundation series and I'm tentatively excited.
[02:04:45] <manicennui> badtuple: Apple TV though.
[02:05:08] <badtuple> daegalus: Ah, I misunderstood then. I thought you were trying for a simplified alternative to smart phones
[02:05:25] <manicennui> While I don't think it will be as bad as I, Robot, I doubt that it will really be about the original work.
[02:05:38] <manicennui> They will take a few ideas and create something new.
[02:05:42] <manicennui> Which can be good or bad.
[02:06:38] <manicennui> daegalus: Frankly, the real idea there might be a universal messaging app with integrations with many services.
[02:06:45] <daegalus> No, I want a pure messaging device. Only text messages, maybe images. And a way to sync links sent to you with a phone to view later. But that's about it. The rest is just integration options for sending to third parties, and a choice of what protocol you want (wifi, bt, loraz etc)
[02:07:07] <daegalus> That's been tried so many times. Would a dedicated device for it change anything?
[02:07:43] <rwb> hey everyone
[02:07:44] <gerikson> what's the size of the target market daegalus  ?
[02:07:45] <rwb> bye everyone
[02:07:47] <rwb> busy day
[02:07:48] <gerikson> apart from you ?
[02:08:02] <manicennui> I don't think the dedicated device for messaging that doesn't integrate with all of the other things people want to do has any legs.
[02:08:50] <manicennui> I think there are many of us who yearn for simpler, streamlined devices, but there isn't much of a market for it.
[02:09:05] <daegalus> gerikso: no clue. Its what I'm trying to figure out. It's just an idea atm
[02:09:22] <manicennui> And even for those of us who might want such a thing, we'd still probably need a smartphone to work and survive.
[02:10:02] <daegalus> This is less about survive and work it's more to unplug or focus but still have basic communication capabilities for those you talk to most often.
[02:10:02] <manicennui> I don't think there are many good examples of technology becoming less complex over time.

[02:25:54] <manicennui> I don't enjoy the work much, and the skill level of our engineering department is kind of questionable, but it is an easy job, and my pay is decent.

[02:27:02] <manicennui> imode: I want to create a company and just do a lot of small projects.
[02:27:09] <bsandro> how long do you have to program stuff to actually burn out of it? to not want to write code anymore

[02:27:31] <technomancy> bsandro: it has nothing to do with the length and everything to do with how you're treated IMO
[02:27:42] <imode> bsandro: it's not "I write a lot of code and I'm sick of it", it's "the work is so uninteresting to the point that I'd rather put a gun in my mouth than touch a keyboard again".

[02:29:40] <Ticho> at work, I recently inherited maintenance of an old C program, and I dabble a bit in python - all of it fun, I'm enjoying it, but I have also noticed that I do not have as much desire to work on my own coding stuff in my free time, because I get my creativity fix at work
[02:29:41] <imode> that anxiety never leaves me.
[02:30:02] <manicennui> I'm more frustrated about knowing about better ways to do things, but we are a Rails/Go shop.

[02:38:26] <manicennui> "The INTP is not interested in experiences themselves but is far more fascinated by concepts. The drive to understand things that are not yet understood is a very powerful force in the life of an INTP. Where the Ti preference is strong, this drive can override the experiential element so strongly that the INTP will become quickly bored with anything that he has successfully analysed to the point of understanding it. Once
[02:38:26] <manicennui> understood, it has nothing left to offer, once the satisfaction which comes with achieving the goal of understanding diminishes."
[02:39:06] <imode> yeah that resonates a bit, might just be confirmation bias and/or mental masturbation though.
[02:39:17] <manicennui> Of course.

[20:26:44] <creature> There's also Litestream, which streams updates to S3.
[20:26:51] <creature> (I've not used it, but it's a neat concept.)
[20:27:13] <companion_cube> yeah it sounds really neat
[20:28:08] <epilys> hoistbypetard, haha, didn't want to make the article about the project, it was about sqlite3 in general
[20:28:35] <epilys> meff[m], depends on your data, is it mostly BLOBs (and large ones too)?
[20:28:49] <epilys> because you can dump the database in plain text and backup that
[20:29:15] <meff[m]> does dumping in plain text affect read/write perf? I'm guessing it does
[20:29:25] <meff[m]> not sure if that's relevant for most sqlite usecases though
[20:29:26] <epilys> perf meaning?
[20:29:38] <meff[m]> performance, e.g. if you have a running app accessing the db
[20:29:52] <epilys> you'd have to benchmark this kind of stuff I guess
[20:30:07] <epilys> can never be sure for questions like this
[20:30:28] <epilys> sqlite3 has live backups too though
[20:31:06] <hoistbypetard> nice work all around, epilys. I've been enjoying poking through that github repo during my idle moments this morning. (I throw things in background tabs as I see them, and it took me till a few hours ago to get 'round to that one). thanks for sharing it all.
