[12:57:59] <pinenut10086> When I use curl to access sftp to download files, I close the sftp server's network port, and when the code executes to curl_easy_cleanup(curl); it will take 930 seconds.
[13:00:01] <quinq> pinenut10086, isn't that your OS default tcp timeout?
[13:00:29] <bagder> pinenut10086: so it grew from 60 to 930 the last three hours ? =)
[13:03:04] <dege> inflation these days..
[13:04:12] <bagder> pinenut10086: I think you see the problem with a blocking "DONE" operation as mention in the TODO here: https://curl.se/docs/todo.html#More_non_blocking
[13:05:27] <pinenut10086> No, execute curl_easy_cleanup(curl); to be 930, not 60.
[13:17:49] <pinenut10086> When the network port of the SFTP server is intact, I establish a connection and save the curl with a map, but do not release it, because frequent init and cleanup are time-consuming. After the connection is established, close the network port of the SFTP server. If you execute cleanup, it will block for 930 seconds, and if you do not execute it, it will block for 60 seconds, no matter how much the timeout is set.

[17:29:59] <bagder> discussed ... on a mailing list
[17:30:07] <bagder> =)
[17:30:33] <Piru> "Even if a program is using a URL with an http scheme (i.e. protocol), the (possibly malicious) server could redirect to a different URL with a different protocol entirely, which would then invoke that code in curl if it is present"
[17:30:37] <Piru> sigh
[17:30:48] <Piru> this post is so misguided
[17:31:08] <bagder> :-/
[17:31:41] <bagder> that was true until 7.65.2
[17:32:41] <apollo13> oh? that sounds like fun :)
[17:33:15] <apollo13> it would be great to have some statistics on how much protocols people actually use in curl
[17:33:26] <apollo13> I think I never used it for anything aside from http(s)
[17:33:28] <Piru> there are statistics
[17:33:31] <bagder> we ask every year in the annual survey
[17:33:43] <apollo13> oh, how do they look?
[17:33:47] <Piru> of course that is what ppl say not what they actually use
[17:33:55] <apollo13> ah found it
[17:34:02] <bagder> https://daniel.haxx.se/media/curl-user-poll-2021-analysis.pdf is the most recent one
[17:34:19] <bagder> yeah, self-reported so a bit rough
[17:35:01] <apollo13> still, there is not much incentive for users to lie

[17:35:03] <moparisthebest> 99.9% of my curl invocations are https but inevitably you have to do something ridiculous one day and realize "oh cool curl can do this too"
[17:35:30] <apollo13> sure, but can != should ;)
[17:36:04] <apollo13> but from that survey it seems like a light variant with https/ftps alone would cover most 
[17:36:18] <Piru> imho the problem in that discussion is making the curl-minimal default
[17:36:51] <apollo13> well without making it default the proposal is rather useless I think
[17:38:03] <moparisthebest> Wait until they realize all the scripts will break if they do that
[17:38:19] <dege> people might not knowingly have used anything other than https, but may well have used scripts that use other protocols
[17:38:32] <dege> moparisthebest: exactly
[17:38:36] <apollo13> sure, but we'd never know unless we tried switching the default
[17:39:12] <apollo13> and it is not like one can't install the rest (curl doesn't even have to be installed on a system fwiw)
[17:39:44] <Piru> this reminds me of making sh link to dash instead of bash
[17:39:53] <Piru> gazillion things b0rked immediately
[17:40:13] <apollo13> I honestly do not see that anywhere near at the same level
[17:41:14] <Piru> I think the problem here is that ppl look this at their own limited point of view or use case
[17:41:36] <Piru> from that point of view some change is likely very sensible and won't cause any issues
[17:41:42] <apollo13> oh do not get me wrong. I fully expect that to break some things
[17:42:06] <apollo13> I just do not think that it will be as horrible as bash to dash
[17:42:22] <moparisthebest> curl isn't installed on everything? I don't want to live in this world
[17:42:25] <Piru> maybe this could be handled via some env variable
[17:43:14] <Piru> then it would be possible to easily relax restrictions when you know you need to allow potentially unsafe protocols
[17:43:42] <Piru> and it would be ignored by older version or binaries that don't implement the restriction ssytem
[17:44:14] <bagder> I think it gets rather futile. Either you reduce the features to minimize risk, and a larger precentage will install the full version and nullify the effort. Or you go the other way, and then the minimal version isn't much safer
[17:44:21] <Piru> it'd also be possible to relax the whole environment by making the env global
[17:45:03] <Piru> if I'd do something like this I'd go with the runtime env variable way rather than different packages
[17:45:28] <bagder> I've proposed such env variables in the past btw

[17:45:40] <Piru> heh :)
[17:45:44] <apollo13> mhm runtime env var is relatively global, there should be functions in curl itself to configure that as well
[17:46:02] <apollo13> although that all probably just concerns the curl binary I guess?
[17:46:11] <Piru> this discussion I guess is mostly about curl command
[17:46:16] <apollo13> in the library usage you usually are more explicit about what is used
[17:46:17] <apollo13> yeah

[17:49:11] <dege> I dont think avoiding DICT support being compiled is the attack vector minimization they think it is
[17:49:43] <bagder> no, as someone in there says, a majority of the problems we've had are in areas they would keep anyway
[17:50:30] <bagder> but then I don't do a distro
[17:50:57] <dege> I do, and I'm not removing DICT from there to make it safer
[17:51:07] <bagder> hehe
