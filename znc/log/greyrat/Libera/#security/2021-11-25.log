[05:19:18] <h4d3443> like making a 1:1 copy of the whole disk? i don't think thats possible, maybe if you have root, and in that case it at least wouldn't run on other makes due to the setup/software/drivers that are specific to a phone

[09:51:55] <CoJaBo> At least a few client VPS instances hosted elsewhere became unreachable, because we couldn't retrieve their IPs, but it was easier and more sane to just move them into our own hosting and restore from backups, and it was actually strange we'd not previously done that

[10:14:56] <CoJaBo> bUT IT'S STILL IN THE DATABASE!!11
[10:16:22] <CoJaBo> One of our most stupidest failures was actually our own doing. Client was a restruant, they mispelled the name of their beers as the name of something illegal, and it got nuked by our purge of said thing
[10:16:41] <CoJaBo> We keep backups of nuked stuff, but only for 7 days, and they didn't notice their site was down for 10
[10:16:56] <drathir_tor> CoJaBo: always rsync backups to remote locations seems as bare minimum... and if keep backups at provided backup space always is needed made a triple sure if such storage is replicated over multiple locations and not between multiple servers at the same dc...
[10:18:19] <CoJaBo> drathir_tor: The building one of our offices was in burnt down one time, that was also fun

[10:34:13] <CoJaBo> The process of getting ~500MB of data off the thing tho, was a nightmare
[10:34:47] <CoJaBo> I couldn't pull the drive, as they use this weird proprietary caddy which had welded itself to the drive over the years

[10:35:24] <drathir_tor> also is funny when current programs browsers for example eat more ram at start than whole os with app running back in time...

[22:07:23] <enick_937> I've got a "home lab" and need one of the servers to take all incoming HTTPS, since all port 443 traffic has to go to one host. What's the best way to distribute that traffic to other hosts as needed?
[22:08:33] <enick_937> 1) Use nginx to sniff the TLS header and forward the still-encrypted traffic to other hosts;
[22:09:20] <pagios> : hi all, if i want to implmnet nagios to get the states of all my switches,routers do i need to let nagios point to each appliance/switch/etc and provide a community id to read the data or is the data already available on the network via multicast or broacdacst and i can read from it ?
[22:09:27] <ajak> enick_937: why does it still need to be encrypted once inside your network?
[22:09:55] <ajak> pagios: why do you want to use nagios? i think most people are switching to something like prometheus
[22:09:56] *** Quits: shad (~shad@user/shad) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[22:09:59] <enick_937> 2) Use nginx to terminate all traffic and forward to other hosts, maybe re-encrypted to protect it on the second hop (uh... wireguard?) and don't run anything sketchy on that host so the decrypted stuff is protected
[22:10:11] <enick_937> #1 seems like the most straightforward and secure-by-default, but I'm wondering if there are downsides.
[22:10:53] <ajak> i would keep the stuff encrypted iff you don't trust your network
[22:11:04] <ajak> and if you don't trust your network, that's a bigger problem :)
[22:11:51] <enick_937> ajak: I don't think the "crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside" data center security model is good in general. But also, this is a home network, so any guest's laptop on the wifi could have malware on it. :-P
[22:12:48] <ajak> well i don't really understand your network topology
[22:13:39] <enick_937> It's literally: Cable modem -> wifi/router -> [home servers, family computers, random guest computers...]
[22:13:43] <enick_937> There's no segmentation.
[22:15:14] <enick_937> I have HTTPS stuff coming in on multiple domain names, but not every domain name is handled by the same host, so some server needs to route the traffic.
[22:15:40] <ajak> so you want to reverse proxy stuff coming in
[22:16:30] <ajak> so probably best to subnet your webservers together somehow and reverse proxy that network
[22:17:48] <pagios> ajak i mainly want visibility over my switches/firewalls, i thought of using snmp and nagios to build a pic of who is using what

[22:26:16] <enick_937> I would agree, and that's along similar lines to why I don't want the proxied data to be unencrypted in transit. :-)
[22:26:38] <enick_937> I've got the servers locked down as well as I would have them if they each had a public IP.
[22:27:59] <pagios>  if i want to get data from routers/switches running netflow, can i use nagios xi? or should i use nagios network analyzer

[23:19:57] <ajak> well we hear less often about things from public intelligence agencies so likewise we hear less about the response to them
[23:20:47] <psystemupdate> maybe the conversation belongs in the #security channel..ill discuss semantic parasites in there and how neuro linguistic semantic parasites can be living with you right now through any App( legal entity) that has microphone permissions
[23:21:51] <psystemupdate> specifically how there's a facination behind the scenes with prayer and schizophrenics, and how there's such financial incentive to track any narrative context an individual may have with an entity
[23:22:11] <psystemupdate> tracking the semantics of an utterance is all the rage at META/facebook these days
[23:22:43] <psystemupdate> gotta sell SSRI pawns to the highest bidder, and gotta have a system for it
