I'm building the foundation for an app and testing out the relationships in the admin app. I have a relation where a user can have vehicles, as well as logbook entries for each vehicle. but how do I enforce that a user can only create a logbook entry for a vehicle id that belongs to that particular user?

[01:27:32] <Batzy> GinFuyou flask uses jinja2 to render, and the syntax looks similar to django. On a view in flask you do `return render_template('index.html', somedata="heya")`. In your actual html you could reference the somedata variable with {{ somedata }} and that would render as "heya"
[01:27:57] <Batzy> django it looks like is supposed to do something similar, but it's not rendering {{ somedata }} as something, it's rendering that as like plaintext
[01:28:40] <GinFuyou> Batzy, well, as I said, it's probably syntax problem in your template.
[01:28:50] <GinFuyou> What is exactly code you have for it?
[01:29:22] <Batzy> the code for the template? by this do you just mean my html file?

[01:54:11] <GinFuyou> Batzy, well, it doesn't match template you've shared

[01:55:11] <Batzy> yeah it's rendering it with plaintext
[01:55:25] <Batzy> wtf
[01:55:49] <hyper_dave> My understanding so far is that if there is a squashed migration and if a clean database is present it will only run the squashed migration, If the db has some of the migrations migrated, it will ignore the squash.

[01:59:30] <FunkyBob> hyper_dave: pretty much... trhe squashed migration will include a list of which migrations it applies, so the history should end up looking the same

[03:06:30] <wallbroken> if i don't specify a form_valid method, the default one will be triggered?
[03:06:43] <FunkyBob> that... is how it works, yes.
[03:06:48] <FunkyBob> do you not understand classes/
[03:06:49] <FunkyBob> ?
[03:07:32] <wallbroken> well, in classes, you have a specific methods called constructors, which they will be called when you create an instance of a class
[03:07:43] <wallbroken> those are the only methods that are called by default
[03:08:04] <wallbroken> but maybe in django things works differently
[03:08:28] <FunkyBob> and now we get back to why I told you not to use class-based views
[03:08:35] <FunkyBob> no, in django things don't work any differently
[03:08:41] <FunkyBob> Python classes are still classes.
[03:09:04] <FunkyBob> but the view function created by calling as_view() ... does a bunch of work, and when it's called calls methods on the class
[03:09:13] <FunkyBob> which then calls methods on itself... as classes do

[03:32:29] <FunkyBob> because what you did makes no sense
[03:32:53] <FunkyBob> since you're looking for the form in the context... why are you trying to render just the field names?
[03:32:58] <FunkyBob> Explain your thinking
[03:35:14] <wallbroken> in my idea, to render the form, i should do: "{{ ConfForm.as_p }}"
[03:35:27] <wallbroken> where ConfForm is the name of the form class
[03:35:37] <FunkyBob> but it's not the class y ou're using, for a start
[03:35:39] <FunkyBob> it's an instance
[03:35:39] <wallbroken> but IDK why it's not rendering anything
[03:35:50] <FunkyBob> because you're rendering things that do not exist
[03:36:18] <FunkyBob> the name would be very very painfully clear if you'd done as we said, and avoided class based views

[03:36:38] <wallbroken> it's here
[03:36:46] <FunkyBob> the name of the form class is irrelevant
[03:37:28] <wallbroken> and where to get the name of the instance of the form?
[03:37:58] <FunkyBob> from the documentation... but go on.. take a wild guess at what a logical default name for the form would be...
[03:39:54] <FunkyBob> a nice, simple, obvious, GENERIC term for a form in the template context.
[03:40:56] <wallbroken> if you're referring to "form", i tell you that it whows another set of fields
[03:41:18] <FunkyBob> then something  else is happening... because 'form' is the right answer
[03:41:29] <dre> wallbroken, then you have two forms
[03:41:37] <wallbroken> {{ form.paginate }}

[04:00:21] <FunkyBob> we can't fix your misunderstanding...if we can't pinpoint it.
[04:00:51] <wallbroken> the goal is to pull out the form fields from the instance of the view and pass it as the current view's context

[04:01:36] <FunkyBob> the goal is to pass an instance of ConfForm to the template
[04:01:43] <FunkyBob> but keep going
[04:02:38] <FunkyBob> why would a User record (self.request.user) have a View as a property?
[04:02:49] <FunkyBob> do you think of a view as "owning" a form class?
[04:03:35] <wallbroken> context = super().ConfigView()
[04:04:14] <FunkyBob> ... once again, I ask questions and get no answers
[04:04:39] <wallbroken> i don't think that
[04:04:58] <FunkyBob> and my other question?
[04:05:23] <FunkyBob> also, why are you looking to the view ... to have the form fields?
[04:05:27] <wallbroken> i was thinking that the self.request.user has the instance of the view classes inside
[04:05:33] <wallbroken> but i was wrong
[04:05:45] <FunkyBob> in what way would a view being inside a user record make sense?
[04:05:53] <FunkyBob> you had a reason to think that... what was it?
[04:06:10] <FunkyBob> a user record... from the database...
[04:06:19] <wallbroken> i was experimenting it to get the answer
[04:06:36] <FunkyBob> experimenting is ok... but without logic or reason, it's not.

[04:08:08] <GinFuyou> nedbat, django is not supposed to serve files, so no, unless you delegate it to your front webserver

[04:10:04] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: actually, surprisingly close to what you need
[04:10:06] <FunkyBob> but
[04:10:20] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i did it already. why you told me that it's bad?
[04:10:25] <wallbroken> that generated confusion in me
[04:10:40] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: because it looked like you were trying to PROCESS the form in tha view...
[04:10:50] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: since you only want the form for rendering, you don't need to save it to self
[04:11:04] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: also, you don't want to pass request.GET to it... since it doesn't care about the _current_ views data
[04:11:11] <wallbroken> i need to save it when clicking "apply"
[04:11:11] <FunkyBob> this is a case of you copy'n'pasting without understanding
[04:11:22] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes, but that "apply" submits to the new view... not this view.
[04:11:36] <wallbroken> yes, and i cannot use another view just to update?
[04:11:36] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: and you need to still pass the current config instance to that form
[04:11:45] <GinFuyou> nedbat, https://blog.tinbrain.net/tutorials/simple-django-deploy.html#configuring-nginx
[04:11:47] <FunkyBob> you can use another view to update... that's what the new view you wrote does

[04:12:32] <shangxiao> Just on the try-a-static-file-then-search-db-if-doesnt-exist… Django _could_ be suitable for that. There's a couple of libs that delegate serving of static files to the webserver (from Django).
[04:12:51] <shangxiao> (so decide in Django what to do, delegate or get from db)
[04:13:04] <FunkyBob> shangxiao: like whitenoise, and x-accel-redirect ?
[04:13:26] <shangxiao> one was the x-sendfile, the other one I can't remember
[04:13:28] <wallbroken> discussion finished?
[04:13:29] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: you need the ConfForm instance in the shoe list view so you can _render- the form
[04:13:43] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: but it will _submit_ to the new view
[04:13:47] <FunkyBob> the new view processes it

[04:29:54] <FunkyBob> it needs to be inside the <form>

[04:44:15] <wallbroken> so i should ad print(form.errors) ?
[04:45:24] <FunkyBob> you should add a template to show the form with its errors, so the user can correct their choices
[04:45:30] <FunkyBob> here's the way it works.
[04:45:50] <FunkyBob> 1. you create a stand-alone update view for the config.  full template, form, the whole lot.
[04:46:02] <FunkyBob> 2. you _also_ render the form into the other page, and that submits to the config view
[04:46:07] <FunkyBob> when it works, it redirects to the list view.
[04:46:13] <FunkyBob> when it fails, it shows the edit page...
[04:46:59] <wallbroken> but how could there have form errors?
[04:47:06] <wallbroken> they are just only two fields

[04:50:47] <FunkyBob> so... we've sort of started backwards on this
[04:51:02] <FunkyBob> focus on the config view... go to /config/  ... edit the details... get _that_ to work first
[04:52:30] <FunkyBob> give it its own template, ensure it shows the form and its errors...

[06:48:06] <FunkyBob> you've never created a UserConfig that's related to the current User
[06:48:41] <wallbroken> but each user should have one by default
[06:49:09] <FunkyBob> then you will need to write code to make that happen

[06:50:24] <FunkyBob> yes, a data migration will help for all your existing users

[06:50:50] <wallbroken> things becomes harder
[06:50:58] <wallbroken> as anything in django...
[06:51:26] <FunkyBob> again a lot of that stems from you not having a solid foundation
[06:51:39] <FunkyBob> but yes... why would you expect django to magically know to create these other records?
[06:51:58] <FunkyBob> I and others recommended you do these config options as an extension of the User model... then this wouldn't be an issue

[08:14:43] <FunkyBob> you still need to refer to self.request
[08:16:07] <wallbroken> get_paginate_by() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
[08:16:19] <wallbroken> def get_paginate_by(self):
[08:16:27] <wallbroken> i given one single argument
[08:16:59] <FunkyBob> the self is implied
[08:17:21] <FunkyBob> look at the docs i linked... what argument does it show ?
[08:17:22] <wallbroken> what?
[08:17:32] <FunkyBob> in the docs the self is implied in the list of arguments
[08:17:37] <FunkyBob> in your code it must be explicit
[08:17:41] <FunkyBob> but look at the docs
[08:17:42] <PaulWay[w]> Ah, the wallbroken saga continues.
[08:17:45] <FunkyBob> what arguments does it show?
[08:17:52] <wallbroken> queryset
[08:17:57] <wallbroken> hello PaulWay[w]
[08:18:00] <wallbroken> how are you
[08:18:14] <PaulWay[w]> Doing well.
[08:18:36] <PaulWay[w]> I added a feature to Django Rest Framework to add extra path parameters in a viewset.
[08:18:48] <wallbroken> i forcely need to specify "self" as the get_paginate_by() argument
[08:18:51] <schinckel> wallbroken: You'll probably want to use `self.request.user.user_config.paginate_by`, rather than pass the request in to the get_paginate_by function.
[08:18:55] <wallbroken> because i use self.request
[08:19:13] <schinckel> You shouldn't need to _call_ get_paginate_by yourself.
[08:19:43] <PaulWay[w]> I need to actually publish this feature in a branch on DRF.
[08:19:57] <schinckel> It's a method on a View, so `self` will be the view class, which has an attribute `request` that you can reference.
[08:20:59] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/6aDb
[08:21:10] <wallbroken> this way it does not render the page
[08:21:35] <wallbroken> 	
[08:21:35] <wallbroken> get_paginate_by() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
[08:21:46] <schinckel> Are you calling get_paginate_by in your code?
[08:21:49] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: as we've covered many times, you always need to specify self on methods in python.
[08:22:08] <wallbroken> in fact i did that
[08:22:08] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: for this method, it will ALSO be passed the queryset... so your version of the method must ALSO accept queryset
[08:22:10] *** Joins: hyper_dave (~hyper_dav@197.156.103.172)
[08:23:07] <PaulWay[w]> FunkyBob: just to clarify - you mean that you have to define a method as `def method(self):` - but you don't have to use it when you do `object.method()`.
[08:23:09] <wallbroken> ok, now it works
[08:23:11] <wallbroken> thank you
[08:23:18] <PaulWay[w]> I think wallbroken might be confused by that maybe?
[08:23:30] <FunkyBob> PaulWay[w]: that is a good detail...
[08:24:08] <FunkyBob> but it likely doesn't help that the django docs don't list self for methods
[08:24:31] <PaulWay[w]> When using them?
[08:24:53] <FunkyBob> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/class-based-views/mixins-multiple-object/#django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin.get_paginate_by
[08:24:56] <FunkyBob> when documenting them
[08:25:19] <PaulWay[w]> Yes - because that's describing how you use them.
[08:25:27] <PaulWay[w]> Not how they're declared.
[08:25:34] <schinckel> I think I could count on one hand the number of times I've written code that _calls_ get_paginate_by.
[08:25:38] <PaulWay[w]> Personally I think that's correct.
[08:26:01] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: and what about how to pull the current values in the form?
[08:26:01] <schinckel> ...and I think I only used them when I _wrote_ paginators and associated classes for that.
[08:26:21] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: oh, we're back to the update view?
[08:26:30] <wallbroken> yes
[08:27:15] <FunkyBob> can you make an effort to MENTINO this
[08:27:17] <FunkyBob> mention
[08:27:26] <FunkyBob> instead of making a rapid context switch and expecting us to know
[08:27:36] <FunkyBob> you do this often, and it's FUCKING annoying
[08:28:49] <wallbroken> ok, do you remeber the problem?
[08:28:59] <PaulWay[w]> What problem?
[08:29:05] <FunkyBob> the view t akes care of this all by itself
[08:29:06] <wallbroken> i have a form to set two fields (dark_mode, paginate)
[08:29:13] <wallbroken> and the apply button
[08:29:16] <wallbroken> now that works
[08:29:28] <wallbroken> the only problem is that is not showing the current values
[08:29:32] <Guest94> Hi anyone here use twilio? All I want to do is make a simple outbound call and be able to hang up from the browser. Not sure what the best approach for this should be. I have multiple submit buttons and POSTs for each button. The call button works but could not figure out how to pass the call.sid when clicking the hangup button
[08:29:39] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: _what_ is not showing the current values?
[08:29:42] <Guest94> https://dpaste.org/O3Ff
[08:29:49] <PaulWay[w]> Guest94: what's not working for you?
[08:30:10] <Guest94> after the if statement on line 25-27, how do i end the call?
[08:30:20] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: https://www.dropbox.com/s/yobxckde394txtg/Untitlssed.png?dl=0
[08:30:20] <wallbroken> this
[08:30:32] <wallbroken> when i load the page
[08:30:33] <Guest94> According to the link i need to pass in a completed status
[08:30:38] <wallbroken> it does not show the current values
[08:30:42] <Guest94> but i need the call_sid from the call
[08:30:45] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: again... load WHICH page?
[08:30:56] <wallbroken> shoe_list.html
[08:30:56] <PaulWay[w]> Whare you storing the call_sid, Guest94?
[08:31:17] <Guest94> oh shoot i forgot thee context line hold on
[08:31:19] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: when you created the ConfForm instance, did you pass the current config instance to it?
[08:31:29] <wallbroken> no
[08:31:30] <PaulWay[w]> If this is a session in the browser, maybe you need to store the session sid it in the browser.
[08:31:34] <FunkyBob> there's y our problem
[08:31:50] <Guest94> https://dpaste.org/5MXi
[08:32:15] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: and how to do that?
[08:32:35] <Guest94> hmm so putting it into a session variable?
[08:32:37] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: when you create the form instance, pass instance=..the instance you want it to work on
[08:32:41] <FunkyBob> just like you've done before
[08:32:45] <PaulWay[w]> Guest94: seems reasonable.
[08:32:57] <Guest94> should i make every button a submit button?
[08:33:05] <Guest94> i feel like that is f'in me up
[08:33:13] <PaulWay[w]> That depends on the Javascript driving your page.
[08:33:18] <Guest94> none at all
[08:33:29] <PaulWay[w]> Ah, amusing.

[08:34:40] *** combengue is now known as cmbengue
[08:34:50] <PaulWay[w]> So you're intending to do this server side?  I thought you'd need a persistent page to run a phone call.
[08:34:50] <wallbroken> model = AccountConfig(instance=...)
[08:34:53] <wallbroken> this way?
[08:35:18] <FunkyBob> no
[08:35:27] <FunkyBob> how is that at all related to making the form instance?
[08:35:43] <wallbroken> one step back
[08:35:46] <Guest94> for instance, this did not work: https://dpaste.org/q4cU
[08:35:53] <wallbroken> where the form instance is created?
[08:36:01] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes
[08:36:15] <PaulWay[w]> Guest94: yes, because your server side does not persist the state of call_sid.
[08:36:16] <FunkyBob> the Form class you're making an instance of so you can render it in that page
[08:36:20] <wallbroken> form_class = ConfForm(instance=)
[08:36:31] <FunkyBob> keep going...
[08:36:43] <PaulWay[w]> You've got to think about that form code being run in two completely separate instances, with no knowledge of previous state.
[08:36:53] <Guest94> i see
[08:36:56] <PaulWay[w]> The only state it has is what you get given from the client, and what you can fetch from the database.
[08:36:59] <wallbroken> what's the name of the instance?
[08:37:03] <wallbroken> "model" ?
[08:37:28] <PaulWay[w]> So either the browser knows it - say in a cookie, or in a variable in a script running on the page - or the server knows it.
[08:37:45] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: no
[08:37:51] <FunkyBob> it's the instance of the user conf that you want to edit
[08:37:57] <PaulWay[w]> are you guessing again wallbroken?
[08:38:00] <Guest94> ok i will try a cookie
[08:38:02] <FunkyBob> the one for the current user
[08:38:10] <PaulWay[w]> I'd suggest the browser, and maybe a cookie, because that way you don't have to store the state of a call in the database.
[08:38:26] <PaulWay[w]> Because that gets stale and then you have to clean things up and it's messy.
[08:38:29] <Guest94> when you say browser you mean javascript?
[08:38:36] <wallbroken> PaulWay[w]: no
[08:38:38] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: self.request.user.user_config
[08:38:44] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes
[08:38:44] <wallbroken> this should be the model instance
[08:38:48] <FunkyBob> correct
[08:38:49] <PaulWay[w]> Maybe.  Cookies are managed by the browser internally.
[08:39:09] <Guest94> ok thanks i will see what i can do
[08:39:19] <PaulWay[w]> The downside is that then you have to trust what the browser tells you.
[08:39:22] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: form_class = ConfForm(instance=request.user.user_config)
[08:39:38] <Guest94> the problem is i don't know any javascript so i feel like the only way i can do this now is through django only
[08:39:48] <FunkyBob> so long as you're putting form_class into the context ... yes
[08:40:04] <PaulWay[w]> Guest94: well, look up how Django handles storing cookies on the browser.
[08:40:09] <PaulWay[w]> And retrieving them.
[08:40:18] <Guest94> ok sounds good
[08:40:27] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i didn't get what you just said
[08:40:41] <Guest94> should i leave all the buttons as submit POST buttons or make some GET?
[08:41:22] <PaulWay[w]> Personal preference - I'd go with POST at this stage for you.
[08:41:32] <Guest94> ok gotcha
[08:41:41] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: you've shown me a single line of code... which in itself looks ok...
[08:41:56] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: but I can't see what else you're doing, so i don't know if you've put this in entirely the wrong place
[08:42:21] <FunkyBob> the right place is inside get_context_data ... and putting that form instance into the context so the template can access it
[08:42:22] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/kwJL
[08:42:38] <FunkyBob> that's
[08:42:42] <FunkyBob> entirely unrelated to what we're doing now
[08:42:50] <FunkyBob> no

[08:49:43] <schinckel> Pretty sunny across most of the country, I believe.
[08:49:52] <schinckel> (and it's a big country)

[08:49:57] <PaulWay[w]> audiobirb: I prefer Postgres.  I'm just being funny.
[08:49:59] <wallbroken> why lockdown again?
[08:50:03] <PaulWay[w]> wallbroken: already vaccinated.
[08:50:05] <audiobirb> PaulWay[w], i do too
[08:50:07] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: I'm vaccinated
[08:50:19] <audiobirb> PaulWay[w], i meant did you encounter any problems with inspectdb
[08:50:20] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: lockdown because the govt botched the vaccine orders, so lots of people can't yet access them
[08:50:22] <audiobirb> you too FunkyBob
[08:50:22] <schinckel> Yeah, we have vaccinations, but only about 25% of the population is double-jabbed.
[08:50:28] <FunkyBob> and we're well behind on getting it done
[08:50:40] <FunkyBob> audiobirb: the thingst o remember about inspectdb... it will put all models in the one 'app'
[08:50:46] <FunkyBob> audiobirb: and it's an automatic tool...
[08:50:50] <PaulWay[w]> audiobirb: never used it.
[08:50:53] <schinckel> Having great success handling the initial pandemic meant that the government felt like they could relax.
[08:51:00] <audiobirb> FunkyBob, how do i specify the app? or does it autogenerate it?
[08:51:01] <FunkyBob> so it will miss nuance, and may not properly understand your schema
[08:51:07] <PaulWay[w]> That's a very ... charitable view schinckel ;-)
[08:51:16] <FunkyBob> audiobirb: just let it generate, and organise the models yourself once it's done
[08:51:22] <audiobirb> ok
[08:51:24] <schinckel> PaulWay[w]: I'm holding a fair bit back...
[08:51:27] <FunkyBob> audiobirb: its purpose is to take away 90% of the effort... not to be perfectr
[08:51:31] <wallbroken> but are vaccinated people still able to contract the virus?
[08:51:34] <PaulWay[w]> schinckel: same.
[08:51:37] <audiobirb> FunkyBob, ok
[08:51:57] <schinckel> wallbroken: Vaccinated people can contract and spread the virus.
[08:51:59] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes, they are... hwoever the chance of serious or lethal consequences are drastically reduced
[08:52:18] <schinckel> There's some reduced transmission, but it's more about how sick unvaccinated people get.
[08:52:31] <FunkyBob> it's like giving your immune system a dossier on the virus... so it knows who to look out for
[08:52:41] <wallbroken> but this is due to this vaccine limitations or all the vaccines work that way?
[08:53:10] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: different vaccines work in different ways... most aim to 'teach' the immune system what t o look out for
[08:53:15] <FunkyBob> and [ideally] know to kill on sight
[08:53:44] <wallbroken> you got comirnaty?
[08:54:16] <FunkyBob> I got the pfizer one
[08:54:28] <FunkyBob> so yes
[08:55:14] <wallbroken> which should be the best one
[08:55:45] <FunkyBob> why?
[08:55:57] <PaulWay[w]> Most vaccines prevent the virus from getting to the point where you're infectious.
[08:56:11] <PaulWay[w]> We haven't reached state of the art on the COVID vaccines yet.

[10:45:46] <jfoster> I have built some DRF endpoints to serve a SPA app, but I also want to utilize them for CRUD operations needed in views.
[10:46:43] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: for creating the default user configuration, the approach is to create a new one in the moment that one user has been created, right?
[10:46:55] <jfoster> I looked into generating an OpenAPI schema and then using that to generate my own python-based SDK. Then I could import my own api and use it directly.  But that is overkill on this project for now.
[10:47:22] <jfoster> Is the best thing to just build a requests-based function for each endpoint operation?
[10:48:26] <jfoster> It seems like I aught to not be interfacing with this built in api at the network level. In the past I've only used my DRF endpoints in the frontend. Or I can't remember using them from within the django app itself.
[10:52:12] <serafeim> hello friends
[10:52:48] <schinckel> jfoster: You may be able to use the API endpoints to generate HTML too.
[10:53:38] <schinckel> I wouldn't use requests to call the code in python - instead consider extracting the business logic into a function and call that in both places instead (if you can't use the view directly from the browser)
[10:54:52] <schinckel> wallbroken: The Australian "exposure" app didn't use the iOS/Android API - instead it used a server-side system based on a Singapore app. There were a bunch of privacy/performance issues.

[11:20:13] *** Joins: rpkilby (~rpkilby@c-24-20-208-106.hsd1.or.comcast.net)
[11:20:44] <jfoster> schinckel thanks for the suggestion. I essentially have the BL code abstracted into functions used in the DRF CBVs. However, I was hoping to use the same json data model, and leverage the same DRF deserialization features.
[11:22:20] <jfoster> These BL functions powering the DRF endpoints presume specific deserialized data. I suppose I could call the drf serializer from python, but it seems like maybe a bit crufty when the endpoints would otherwise be a single source of truth.
[11:23:07] <schinckel> Yeah, but you don't want to be doing an HTTP request to your own server.
[11:23:31] <schinckel> You can call views directly (by passing them a request, and any relevant args).
[11:23:44] <schinckel> Maybe you can do something similar with DRF?
[11:23:53] <jfoster> I don't. Though, the frontend would be doing that with these endpoints anyway, right?
[11:23:57] <schinckel> (I don't know - I find DRF rubs me the wrong way and I try to avoid it)
[11:24:07] <jfoster> Ya, it does seem like the views should be able to be called directly. that would be preferable.
[11:24:11] <schinckel> If the frontend calls them directly (ie, from the browser) then that's fine.
[11:24:27] <schinckel> As I said, you can have DRF views return HTML, I believe.
[11:24:35] <schinckel> But it's the incoming form-handling that I'm not so sure about.

[11:24:58] <jfoster> I didn't understand that note about returning html in the context of my question surface, can you explain a bit more what you mean?
[11:25:13] <schinckel> DRF views can return HTML instead of JSON.
[11:25:28] <schinckel> Then you can use those in the browser.
[11:26:12] <jfoster> Ah, the endpoint i'm focused on is for posting a blob of nested json data to an endpoint for a Create.
[11:26:42] <schinckel> You can have your HTML views call the DRF endpoints, and deal with the JSON in the browser.
[11:30:42] <carlorat1> is there any doc on how to document models?
[11:30:52] * doc waves
[11:30:52] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes... create the user config when a user is created
[11:31:04] <jfoster> there is a doc tor in the house
[11:31:21] <FunkyBob> i think years ago I made a special one-to-one field that would auto-create a record if you tried to reverse access
[11:32:27] <FunkyBob> however, as I mentioned... these days people tend to avoid the 'profile model' pattern you've implemented
[11:32:36] <FunkyBob> and instead customise the fields directly on the User

[11:42:50] <serafeim> jfoster: i don't build apis. i jus use django as it is *intended* to be used !
[11:43:06] <wallbroken> so, the concept is that signal is triggering the code of account config creation when a new user is created
[11:43:23] <serafeim> i.e using good old server side views and avoiding most javascript
[11:44:02] <jfoster> serafeim  how do you support other clients?
[11:44:10] <serafeim> jfoster: what do you mean other clients ?
[11:44:19] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yes
[11:44:33] <serafeim> also concerning this discussion, i see a commit 8 days ago (https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework). so the answer should be obvious!
[11:45:39] <wallbroken> so, we need two sides
[11:45:43] <wallbroken> a sender and a receiver
[11:45:43] <jfoster> FunkyBob OOC, what about using a custom manager for the user model that tacks on the config model instantiation?
[11:45:53] <wallbroken> both sides needs to be defined in signals.py
[11:46:22] <jfoster> serafeim are you being sarcastic? the issue points out that the commits lately are largely typos.
[11:46:24] <serafeim> jfoster: also the tom christie answer says that he will support the project. so what the problem with DRF ?
[11:46:25] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: there is already a sender
[11:46:31] <FunkyBob> you just need to register to hear it
[11:46:38] <serafeim> jfoster: did you actually read what tom christie wrote ?
[11:47:12] <serafeim> i really don't see any problems
[11:47:43] <jfoster> serafeim Sure, and I take him at that. However, the reason I used the word grim is that there was a serious, good faith question about the project's lifeblood. And then TC made a serious good faith response to that.  This is the primary API authoring for the framework.  It concerns me a wee bit that it would be in this spot.
[11:48:19] <jfoster> Especially given how much attention is going to alternative methods for implementing APIs in python right now.
[11:48:36] <serafeim> jfoster: i think they will just transfer it to other maintainers. there are many people that would like to maintain that project.
[11:49:16] <serafeim> or maybe he'll do another kickstarter campain to get money to support it or release a new version
[11:49:29] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: so, when i create a new user, i should trigger this print?
[11:49:30] <wallbroken> def my_callback(sender, **kwargs):
[11:49:30] <wallbroken>     print("Request finished!")
[11:50:06] *** Joins: daylight (~manjaro-u@175.101.143.57)
[11:50:45] <jfoster> That would be fine. There are definitely positive outcomes, however, I don't think great API programming implementation is optional for a modern web framework of any kind.  It is a bit worrisome to me that django is so leveraged up on DRF.  I don't mean to say the sky is falling, but that issue and the response was a little bit shocking to me.
[11:51:45] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: err... wat?
[11:52:12] <serafeim> well concerning the API, nothing forbids you to implement it yourself. django gives you all the tools. the DRF is not really needed for most cases
[11:52:49] <serafeim> and I definitely wouldn't like to see a change in the direction of API from a traditional web framework to a framework for building SPAs
[11:53:06] <serafeim> change in the direction of *django*
[11:53:30] <FunkyBob> serafeim: as you say, t here's no need
[11:53:36] <FunkyBob> django already supplies t he basics needed
[11:54:33] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: you said that there is already a sender
[11:54:44] <wallbroken> so what i created is just the receiver code
[11:54:59] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: correct
[11:55:11] <FunkyBob> write a function to handle the signal, and register it with the correct signal
[11:55:23] <wallbroken> def my_callback(sender, **kwargs):
[11:55:23] <wallbroken>     print("Request finished!")
[11:55:24] <wallbroken> this
[11:55:32] <jfoster> Hm. I had not taken writing api endpoints from scratch in django seriously. I had thought there were enough permission, serialization and other RESTy features that would make that a lot of unwanted work.
[11:55:34] <wallbroken> i already wrote that
[11:55:38] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: stop

[11:56:27] <FunkyBob> don't do it
[11:56:36] <FunkyBob> one line is the limit, as you well know

[12:02:12] <jfoster> FunkyBob I realize that, though DRF does a lot of stuff consistently--especially in how it handles models.   I think what you're saying is it doesn't matter if DRF is getting attention or not, because Django is fine as an API builder without it. Is that ~correct?
[12:03:28] <FunkyBob> is DRF lacking in maintenance?
[12:04:02] <FunkyBob> the main thing lacking in django for APIs, imho, is a serialiser toolkit, an API analogue to Forms
[12:04:34] <FunkyBob> certainly, that's a lot of where I focused energy in nap
[12:05:28] <serafeim> FunkyBob: don't you like the serialization framework https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/serialization/ ?

[12:07:49] <jfoster> funkybob Ya, see "grim" above. I guess I have some concern that Django, while stable and wonderful because of it--is getting slowly pulled apart or unbundled by FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.
[12:10:21] <jfoster> The heavy emphasis on feature-complete OpenAPI stuff in TC's response is a nod to just how fast the API space is moving.

But I'm not sure it always had competition. Wasn't the go-to 'framework' drupal prior to django? That was what I used at my peak php :p. I thought what initially set django apart was that it was moving so fast.
[12:18:33] <jfoster> People got all mad about breakage and difficult upgrades. I just don't want this pendulum to go too far, because the "web" is not slowing down.

Saying, "ya it would be cool if django had a killer API builder beyond JSONResponse" or "Ya, it would be awesome if Django was the python backend of choice for people getting started with React" These ideas are met with a defensive tone, or

[23:09:14] <jfoster> Because I want django to be in it for the long haul and i want to be able to recommend to new people, regardless of their initial focus to take a serious look at django. New blood is critical to the success of a community
[23:16:01] <Guest67> hi i am trying to setup browser calls with twilio
[23:16:03] <Guest67> https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/tutorials/browser-calls-python-django#setting-up-a-twilio-device-client
[23:16:17] <Guest67> not sure what to do with this node.js code i think they mislabeled it?
[23:16:22] <Guest67> It is jqeury or ajax?
[23:16:27] <Guest67> not sure where to put this
[23:16:32] <Guest67> https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/browser-calls-django/blob/main/browser_calls/static/js/browser-calls.js
[23:16:47] <Guest67> i have browser-calls.js and jquery in my script tags
[23:17:15] <Guest67> i am getting Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[23:17:23] <Guest67> i copied their code directly
[23:18:15] <Guest67> i also downloaded this https://github.com/twilio/twilio-voice.js and it is in my script tags
[23:20:53] <Guest67> for a django tutorial it is not clear what to do for people like me who lack js knowledge
