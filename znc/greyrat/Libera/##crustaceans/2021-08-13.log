[20:02:05] <river> i misinterpreted the title first time around
[20:03:32] <companion_cube> kirch: too long
[20:03:58] <manicennui> I really dislike how people create channels in slack for specific issues, and then the channel is eventually archived, making that discussion less accessible.
[20:04:10] <manicennui> And I try not to use Slack's search because it is ass.
[20:04:44] <manicennui> I can find random discussions about some issue in email from 2 years ago.
[20:05:01] <manicennui> Not sure what exactly makes it easier.

[20:15:22] <kirch> Nope, I mostly only knew she was blonde.
[20:16:11] <jjuran> I assume the author meant that bad writing can kill people, so I pretended to assume the opposite
[20:16:13] <manicennui> I think I assumed that she was American.
[20:16:58] <jjuran> I didn't read far enough to find out for sure
[20:17:14] <manicennui> I can't stand the writing in that article to be honest.
[20:17:20] <manicennui> I read a few paragraphs.
[20:20:27] <kirch> basically: SSC uses a lot of words to say literally nothing - but also litters in some "my nazi friends aren't so bad" stuff every now and then
[20:21:06] <kirch> it's like that sales/marketing technique of getting people to say "Yes" a lot, so that when you give them the "Call to Action" they say "Yes"
[20:21:24] <manicennui> I'd say the author of that article also uses far too many words.
[20:21:49] <manicennui> I guess I don't know why I'd want to be informed about these people.
[20:22:00] <prussian> who are we flaming?
[20:22:38] <manicennui> I question how effective it actually is to focus on "exposing" other people.
[20:22:58] <manicennui> Not referring to people doing illegal/immoral things.
[20:23:10] <manicennui> But like some Internet blowhard.
[20:23:20] <manicennui> Seems like singing to the choir.
[20:23:30] <manicennui> And his fans will just double down.
[20:23:46] <prussian> idk. people say all sorts of shit you can hang them on and expose them too I guess. what matters is how far up the food chain you are for it to matter
[20:23:47] <manicennui> Being upset all the time is easy.
[20:23:58] <prussian> also that
[20:23:59] <jjuran> Reading that would take time that I could instead spend on other things
[20:24:05] <manicennui> I'd rather focus on positive things, or at least constructive things.
[20:24:17] <prussian> ok I am reading it and he was talking about british occult stuff
[20:24:22] <prussian> is it worth going further?
[20:24:44] <kirch> not if you love slatestarcodex and think the lesswrong guys are geniuses
[20:24:45] <manicennui> prussian: I don't think the rest of that particular article is about British occult stuff.
[20:24:50] <manicennui> But I only read a few paragraphs.
[20:24:58] <manicennui> I rather read about British occult stuff too.
[20:25:14] <prussian> lesswrong...
[20:25:19] <prussian> ok I'll just close this tab
[20:25:38] <manicennui> The thing is, I've read things on lesswrong and from slatesstarcodex that made me think. That doesn't mean I agreed with them.
[20:25:50] <prussian> sure
[20:25:58] <kirch> I mean... if you can tolerate reading slatestarcodex, you can read this...
[20:26:00] <jjuran> You know what also makes you think?  Advent of Code!
[20:26:02] <manicennui> And it wasn't their racist/fascist rants.
[20:26:04] <prussian> I too, have read less wrong stuff that made me think, but jesus.
[20:26:08] <manicennui> And not advocating that everyone read their stuff.
[20:26:10] <prussian> it's an exercise
[20:26:13] <manicennui> But I've organically come across it.
[20:26:37] <manicennui> But I think if you read a bit more you quickly realize what is going on, and you don't seek it out.
[20:26:41] <manicennui> And move on with your life.
[20:26:54] <manicennui> You aren't going to fix the racists/fascists by writing about them.
[20:27:11] <manicennui> (Not saying that anyone should refrain from writing about whatever they want.)

[20:30:00] <companion_cube> Anyway, I'm tired of "rationalists"
[20:30:03] <prussian> I hate doing undo
[20:30:17] <manicennui> jjuran: I think a lot about how I'd like to implement a lot of software as transactions that can be reversed.
[20:30:18] <prussian> I still half assed my undo for my crappy irc thing.

[20:30:21] <jjuran> Next will be saved games
[20:30:30] <kirch> the cool thing about being a rationalist is that you can rationalize anything
[20:30:32] <manicennui> Basically event sourcing.
[20:30:37] <prussian> kirch: powerful...
[20:30:39] <companion_cube> kirch: so true
[20:30:44] <prussian> many such cases.

[20:31:16] <jjuran> If I'd done saved gmes first, it would have been tempting to just save the board state, making saved games un-undoable.
[20:31:17] <companion_cube> I have something that uses basically event sourcing to synchronize two processes
[20:31:23] <kirch> oh, the evil thing is OK in this instance because I'm rationally explained all the reasons I'm excempt from the good/evil dichotomy
[20:31:29] <prussian> at least there is finally a site where you can actually crowd source VC instead of buying an IOU for some product.

[20:31:55] <companion_cube> Rococo's basilisk
[20:32:18] <prussian> jjuran: could just do a series of steps so you can replay up to save point
[20:32:24] <prussian> I think that's how wesnoth saves work.
[20:32:27] <prussian> for instance.
[20:32:48] <prussian> well, the replays at least.
[20:32:51] <prussian> maybe same diff.
[20:33:20] <jjuran> I don't have saving done yet, but it can load stored games (constructed manually).  The save file just contains a series of moves, each encoded in a byte.
[20:33:31] <prussian> nice.
[20:35:30] <companion_cube> Events as bytecode!
[20:35:54] <jjuran> 0xb1 is a move in the top center square, like a spreadsheet.  Though I'm debating making that the bottom instead, like chess.
[20:38:48] <jjuran> Meanwhile, at $work, I'm dealing with a test program that breaks the compiler.  We use creduce to generate reasonable-sized code samples to debug, but since the original file takes over 20 seconds to hit the backend, reduction takes over five hours.

[23:56:44] <indigo> Did... they program them using node.js or something
[23:57:04] <gwozniak> Looks like it was mostly "fill in the blank" style programming
[23:57:41] <gwozniak> They had a skeleton of what it would take to get the microcontroller to do something and just went about filling in some values
[23:57:45] <ngoldbaum> thankfully gwozniak has a great book he can suggest to master C pointers
[23:57:57] <manicennui> Maybe they are a time traveler from the 60s and they are like, "People created what?"
[23:58:03] <gwozniak> I actually use an example from that book as my question
[23:58:12] <manicennui> "Undefined behavior? Why?"
[23:58:25] <indigo> Reminds me of a junior developer I used to work with
[23:58:47] <indigo> He was working very hard on his first task for a week or so, so I asked him for an update, whether he needed help or anything
[23:59:06] <indigo> He wrote his code in Notepad, and then asked where to paste it in
[23:59:20] <ngoldbaum> indigo: do people get hired at google that completely have no idea how to write code? like is the whole interview process a sham?
[23:59:31] <gwozniak> indigo: oof
[23:59:53] <indigo> ngoldbaum: This wasn't at Google
