[00:04:36] <marcus> I'm trying to map a keybinding to a lua function using maps, but for some reason the first letter of the function is eaten somewhere ( I write vim.lsp... but it tries to run I'm.lsp... - if I do :lua im=vim it works... Any ideas on how I can track what's doing this down? as an example, here's a function that gives this error `nnoremap("[e", function() vim.diagnostic.goto_prev() end, "silent", "Prev Error")`

[00:06:12] <marcus> error just goes `E5108: Error executing lua [string ":lua"]:1: attempt to index global 'im' (a nil value)` with no useful stracktrace.
[00:06:18] <clason[m]> yeah, that doesn't work
[00:06:40] <clason[m]> to map a lua function directly, you need to put it into a callback (or use the `vim.keymap` API)
[00:06:46] <clason[m]> master only, I'm afraid
[00:06:53] <clason[m]> (either)
[00:07:54] <marcus> clason[m]: isn't wrapping it in function() .. end making it a callback?
[00:08:01] <clason[m]> no
[00:08:18] <ii14[m]> it's making it a function :)
[00:08:42] <clason[m]> which vimscript knows nothing about
[00:08:59] <marcus> this is all inside lua tho
[00:09:16] <marcus> note I'm using this - https://github.com/b0o/mapx.nvim
[00:09:30] <ii14[m]> the hell is "im"?
[00:09:34] <ii14[m]> is it a typo?
[00:09:39] <marcus> it's eating the v
[00:09:41] <clason[m]> well, that would have been necessary context
[00:09:42] <marcus> from vim
[00:09:50] <clason[m]> then you need to ask whoever wrote that plugin
[00:09:59] <ii14[m]> okay, but is it actually "vim" or "im"
[00:10:16] <marcus> ii14[m]: in my code it's vim, but somehow when it's run the first letter is gone
[00:10:28] <ii14[m]> okay
[00:10:56] <marcus> If I do https://dogfood.convos.chat/file/2/pxuR5FpDYVnr3mvV the code runs as expected :-/
[00:11:08] <marcus> was more asking how I can get a better trace of errors like these.
[00:11:10] <ii14[m]> you sure about that? because that what error says, that there is no "im"
[00:11:25] <ii14[m]> you have a typo somewhere
[00:11:48] <marcus> ii14[m]: Yes, I'm very surprised too. I don't have 'im' anywhere, only 'vim'. 
[00:12:03] <ii14[m]> in some plugin maybe?
[00:12:49] <ii14[m]> `grep -R '\bim\b'`
[00:13:03] <ii14[m]> in the directory where you have all your plugins

[00:14:35] <sunjonSenghanBri> can you show your nnoremap wrapper?
[00:15:10] <marcus> nothing in my ~/.config/nvim..
[00:16:20] <sunjonSenghanBri> oh, you did. a plugin
[00:16:26] <marcus> sunjonSenghanBri: It's https://github.com/b0o/mapx.nvim/blob/main/lua/mapx.lua#L187
[00:17:09] <mjlbach[m]> fwiw there is vim.keymap on master now
[00:17:25] <ii14[m]> what happens if you run just `:lua vim.diagnostic.goto_prev()`?
[00:18:12] *** Joins: veesh (~veesh@89.237.98.172)
[00:19:51] <marcus> ii14[m]: it works as expected. I see the plugin calls     vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(opts.buffer, mode, lhs, rhs, bopts) - any way for me to read those back out?
[00:20:31] <ii14[m]> you can just edit the source code
[00:20:54] <marcus> I meant more as in read the defined keymap
[00:20:58] <ii14[m]> we don't have a debugger yet
[00:21:13] <marcus> looks like there's a getter too
[00:21:14] <sunjonSenghanBri> did you try just setting the keymap using the native method?
[00:21:18] <ii14[m]> yeah you can, `:nmap <key>`
[00:21:23] <ii14[m]> `:nmap [e`
[00:21:27] <clason[m]> `nvim_get_keymap` is a thing
[00:22:01] <clason[m]> (you can't ask for a single mapping, but it shouldn't be hard to extract the one you want from the returned table)
[00:22:42] <ii14[m]> just btw, I think `[g` and `]g` do this by default in nvim
[00:24:01] <ii14[m]> also you can just map normal mode command, `<cmd>lua vim.diagnostic.goto_prev()<cr>`
[00:25:58] <sunjonSenghanBri> wth, I looked on element, and everyone had weird emoji's as avatars. So I left.
[00:26:29] <clason[m]> That's been like that forever...

[00:34:02] <marcus> ii4[m]: Yeah, it actually worked when I mapped it as normal mode, this problem occurred when I changed to lua. Just bugging me so trying to figure out why :) Somehow I feel it has something to do with <Cmd> and space actually. my pluggin maps to `lua require'mapx'.mapper:func(10, vim.v.count)` - I think it's the vim.v.count that gets it's v eaten

[06:54:54] <dre> you might have better luck in #vim. I think most of us here use the lua equivalents ( nvim-lsp, nvim-cmp, etc )
[06:55:08] <arch-angel> oh
[06:55:29] <dre> as a side point :) someone might know though 
[06:56:02] <arch-angel> I'm following this https://dane-bulat.medium.com/vim-setting-up-a-build-system-and-code-completion-for-c-and-c-eb263c0a19a1
[06:56:24] <arch-angel> can't find any guides to setting up a C++ CMake IDE on nvim
[06:57:40] <arch-angel> dre, is using the lua equivalents better or no?
[06:58:19] <dre> arch-angel, the main things to remember is that 1. they're different 2. you'll need support. 
[06:58:31] <arch-angel> what support?
[06:58:37] <dre> like if you get stuck 
[06:59:31] <dre> I think yes, the lua versions are better, because lua is more readable than vimL, and the lsp way of doing things make more sense. 
[06:59:47] <dre> you're a little more on your own in some regards, but you'll get more flexibility to make the system how you want it to be.
[06:59:57] <dre> I'd say give it a go

[07:38:25] <morenonatural[m]> you can start with providing compile_commands.json from cmake or using BEAR, then get clangd configured and running and finally configuring clang-tidy rules in clangd
[07:40:54] <morenonatural[m]> most autocompletion packages should work from there. I'm using https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp 
[07:48:01] <arch-angel> ahhhhh forget it, I'm used to pressing F6 and CLion compiling it for me
[07:48:12] <arch-angel> apparently emacs and nvim cant provide me that
[07:48:33] <arch-angel> or maybe there isn't any guides out there as far as I know
[07:50:33] <arch-angel> but one thing that I've learned is that vim keys are incredibly powerful
[07:50:48] <p00f> arch-angel: vim-dispatch?
[07:51:12] <arch-angel> i've tried vim-dispatch, but it doesn't know where my build directory is, it starts from my $HOME
[07:51:29] <arch-angel> my projects are embedded deep in folders so trying to navigate to the folder itself is already a pain
[07:51:57] <arch-angel> and I have like 5 projects
[07:52:33] <p00f> just create a `.git` folder wherever you want the root to be
[07:53:08] <p00f> then nvim will most probably cd to that location
[07:53:14] <arch-angel> I already have a .git folder there
[07:53:24] <arch-angel> nvim doesn't know it apparently
[07:53:24] <p00f> and vim-dispatch will use tha
[07:53:33] <arch-angel> nope, it doesn't know either
[07:53:38] <arch-angel> it starts from my ~/
[07:53:43] <arch-angel> rather than the .git folder
[07:53:44] <p00f> which lsp thing do you use?
[07:53:50] <arch-angel> I'm just using YCM
[07:54:03] <arch-angel> tabnine/YouCompleteMe to be exact
[07:54:23] <arch-angel> I only plugged that in along with a theme plugin only
[07:54:25] <arch-angel> nothing else
[07:54:31] <arch-angel> ah and also vim-dispatch
[07:55:37] <p00f> so your clangd works even when the directory is wrong?
[07:55:46] <p00f> what does `:pwd` say?
[07:56:01] <arch-angel> uh let me just upload my init.vim to termbin
[07:56:06] <arch-angel> https://termbin.com/gcgn
[07:57:44] <p00f> what does `:pwd` say tho
[07:57:54] <arch-angel> wait yea
[07:58:17] <arch-angel> "/home/arch-angel"
[07:58:33] <arch-angel> yeap
[07:59:13] <arch-angel> I'm currently editing a C++ source code that's in a folder without a .git directory, as it's a subproject of a larger project
[07:59:27] <arch-angel> a .git/ folder is present in it's parent directory though
[08:01:12] <p00f> use something like airblade/vim-rooter if ycm doesn't change the directory automatically
[08:01:25] <arch-angel> I'm using :edit path/to/file.cc
[08:01:32] <arch-angel> if that's relevant to this problem
[08:01:46] <arch-angel> I'm like really new to nvim and that's the only way I know to open a file
[08:03:24] <arch-angel> i'll try the vim-rooter
[08:03:35] <p00f> arch-angel: yeah i think you should use vim-rooter for this
[08:04:32] <arch-angel> and may I know, I've set nnoremap <C-m>b to run :Dispatch
[08:04:43] <arch-angel> but when I try to invoke C-m i don't get anything?

[12:10:34] <DavideP[m]> I have a question: I deal daily with ros (robot operating system) which uses files .launch that usually contain special imports for other files in the form `    <include file="$(find px4_fast_planner)/launch/geometric_controller.launch">` and I would like to expand the funcionality of `gf` command to also work for the files in the quotation marks. 
[12:12:15] <DavideP[m]> for these I would need to manipulate the string a bit, as the `$(find px4_fast_planner)` cannot be directly used from cmd, but it has to be modified into `$(rospack find px4_fast_planner)`
[12:12:28] <DavideP[m]> how could I write a function to do so?

[12:37:57] <DavideP[m]> substitute seems to act similarly to :%s/pattern/stuff/g
[12:38:06] <DavideP[m]> or doesn't it?
[12:38:29] <sunjonSenghanBri> it does
[12:38:39] <sunjonSenghanBri> anything you get working there, you can put in a function with the same patterns
[12:39:01] <DavideP[m]> I just need an internal substituition to then use the result to open the file

[12:42:01] <sunjonSenghanBri> I just changed it to be non-greedy, so it won't break if there happens to be another `)` later in the string
[12:44:43] <DavideP[m]> ok so, technically I could now do `:test_gf` to run it once sourced?
[12:45:29] <sunjonSenghanBri> well, that would execute a command, which it isn't
[12:45:41] <sunjonSenghanBri> you can `:source %` to run that file as a test
[12:45:59] <DavideP[m]> ok
[12:46:04] <sunjonSenghanBri> then look into calling the function from wherever you do in `gf` land

[16:04:32] <senan[m]> hi all I'm using lspconfig. I have two lanuage servers are associated to the same filetype (.ts) but I gave the two servers different root_markers (one looks for deno.json, another package.json)

[16:04:47] <senan[m]> can I suppress this message? it's fine that it doesn't match 
[16:08:42] <sunjonSenghanBri> the error message is sent from lspconfig > `vim.notify`. You can set vim.notify to be a function, that does whatever you want with the message
[16:09:27] <sunjonSenghanBri> you could set up a table of patterns to match against, and filter the result

[18:21:33] <ii14[m]> that was an honest question, what problem exactly does it solve
[18:21:43] <ii14[m]> because I don't get it
[18:21:57] <p00f> the problem of cwd not changing duh
[18:22:46] <p00f> i would want `:make` to work all the time in any project with a makefile for example
[18:22:52] <ii14[m]> I just enter the project directory, run neovim and it works
[18:23:21] <p00f> i skip entering the directory part
[18:23:49] <p00f> telescope frecency/oldfiles/project or startify if it was recent enough
[18:24:01] <ii14[m]> so you run nvim from home directory?
[18:24:01] <p00f> I don't get the hate tho
[18:24:09] <p00f> ii14[m]: yes
[18:24:12] <ii14[m]> I don't hate it, I'm just asking
[18:24:19] <p00f> p00f: these plugins don
[18:24:27] <p00f> these plugins don't misbehave i mean
[18:25:56] <ii14[m]> I have a `dev` function/command in zsh that lists all directories in `~/dev` in fzf where all my stuff is, so it's instant to find the project I need
[18:26:08] <zeraphel> my primary problem is that buffer's cwd, tab's cwd and vim's cwd may differ.  and  the end user may want them to differ.  leading to most of these plugins either breaking on manual [tl]cd's or breaking other plugins.
[18:26:13] <ii14[m]> and then one nvim instance per project basically
[18:27:46] <ii14[m]> I also have a `<C-R><C-D>` mapping on the command line that takes the path leading to the current directory, so if I want to cd to it, it's just `:cd <C-R><C-D>` and enter
[18:28:32] <zeraphel> +++ i have such a mapping aswell,  <leader>cd.   except it will :tcd cause i find that more intuitive and efficient :)
[18:29:49] <ii14[m]> I don't have a mapping that does :cd, just inserts the path
[18:30:31] <zeraphel> Plus you can always finddir / findfile to search upwards to the directory containing .git/ or Makefile,  doing this automatically is just nonsense

[19:06:32] <p00f> i don't have too many buffers in one nvim instance (because different projects in different nvim instances in different workspaces)
[19:06:53] <p00f> `:b <tab>` is enough most of the time
[19:07:53] <ii14[m]> for me `:b` without arguments runs fzf and with arguments acts like normal `:b` command
[19:08:11] <ii14[m]> same for `:h`
[19:08:29] <p00f> but `<tab>` selects entries in fzf right?
[19:08:45] <zeraphel> also didn't mean you *should* work on multiple projects from same n/vim instance. only that that you are free to set a tab's working directory to something else so that you *could* do so when you need to.  primary example would be changing something in nvim / your dotfiles \o/
[19:09:31] <ii14[m]> what I mean is that when I run just `:b` it start fzf with buffers (`:Buffers`), and if I run `:b something` it acts as you'd expect it to
[19:10:01] <p00f> oh nice
[19:10:32] <zeraphel> i had written a similar mapping last week, before i stopped using cmp-cmdline
[19:10:35] <ii14[m]> yeah, and same thing for `:h`, without arguments it runs fzf's `:Helptags`

[23:28:24] <zeraphel> vim.diff ??  god i love you guys :-)  this is the kind of thing i could only dream about in vim..

[23:31:42] <sunjonSenghanBri> I'd not know vim.diff was the final product, but I'd seen lots of diff related plugins from him last year, and forgotten about it ðŸ˜–
[23:32:07] <clason[m]> well, yes, gitsigns is the bee's knees
[23:39:01] <LewisRussell[m]> Happy to be of service
[23:41:02] <iago-lito[m]> @clason And do you think I can use my custom function (wrapping a few `vim.diff` calls) as a `&diffexpr`? One way to do so would be to output the results to `v:fname_out` files on disk *etc.*, but this defeats the purpose of the "internal engine", right?
[23:42:51] <LewisRussell[m]> Avoid disk access if you can

[23:44:19] <iago-lito[m]> I'd love to, but I'm afraid this is what `&diffexpr` is expecting, right?

[23:48:31] <LewisRussell[m]> Yeah I guess so. If it was me I justed wouldn't use diffexpr and implement the diff decorations manually with the help of scrollbind
[23:49:01] <iago-lito[m]> (about to type `:h scrollbind`)
[23:53:44] <iago-lito[m]> Arh, IIUC Lewis Russell I would then need to reimplement all the `filler`, coloring logic *etc.* manually, right? I'd better go for a disk access then :\
[23:53:53] <iago-lito[m]> s/*etc.*/_etc._/, s/manually/by myself/
[23:54:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> would that be hard?

[23:54:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> each cell/range has one of a preset group of values, right?

[23:57:59] <iago-lito[m]> Okay, I understand what you mean sunjon (Senghan Bright), but I feel like this is going too far off my strict wrapping of `vim.diff`. Is there not rather a way to highjack vim's diffing logic with custom calls to `vim.diff`? Something like `&diffexpr` that would not require disk access?
[23:58:51] <iago-lito[m]> Maybe it's worth a small issue @ [neovim/neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)?
