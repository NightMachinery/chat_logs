[08:19:34] <SirSceptalot> morning
[08:20:09] <SirSceptalot> ara maccas and hunter done argueing about their rights and covid yet?
[08:21:51] <PattyCakes> my contractor just left, almost speechless at the absurdity of the kind of gate I want installed
[08:22:03] <PattyCakes> I mean of course, he's down - starts tomorrow, but it was just funny
[08:22:24] <SirSceptalot> what kind of gate do you want?
[08:22:26] <PattyCakes> "you CAN but WHY woulld you do that?!" - because mr contractor, I am PattyCakes -  I am absurd
[08:23:00] <PattyCakes> SirSceptalot not an exact replica of what I'm doing, but this is the general idea https://put.gd/1644523105
[08:23:40] <PattyCakes> instead of steel, I'm using 6x6 posts, and not gonna use something as absurd as door hinges on the fucking gate
[08:24:54] <SirSceptalot> looks pretty gate-shaped. Although the design isn't something that jives with me, i don't know what's so super weird about it
[08:25:08] <PattyCakes> see I do things in stages, piece meal style. This new gate seems stupid because there's no driveway poured or garage back there yet
[08:25:26] <PattyCakes> so it's just an absurd double swing gate that goes "no where" (just to the back yard)
[08:25:26] <SirSceptalot> I thought it was going to be one of those flower-petal-opening gates or something
[08:25:40] <PattyCakes> I mean it's gonna have motor opening on it eventually
[08:25:45] <SirSceptalot> I have another question though
[08:25:48] <PattyCakes> si senior
[08:26:00] <SirSceptalot> why the hell is that grainy-ass image 5MB?
[08:26:20] <PattyCakes> it was a screen grab on a high res monitor
[08:26:22] <PattyCakes> of a low rest video
[08:27:53] <SirSceptalot> PattyCakes, thought it was going to be something like this: https://9gag.com/gag/aq7Wd3P
[08:28:15] <PattyCakes> well that's about the whitest rich person thing I've ever seen
[08:28:27] <SirSceptalot> LOL
[08:29:01] <SirSceptalot> that reminds of that door... lemme see if i can find that
[08:29:05] <PattyCakes> I retract my statement, and update it to "well, I'm having a very nice gate installed"
[08:29:06] <PattyCakes> I guess
[08:29:14] <PattyCakes> because if that's my competition
[08:29:16] <PattyCakes> I bow out
[08:29:40] <PattyCakes> imagine the maintance on that

[08:32:54] <PattyCakes> I fucking hate everything about that
[08:33:02] <SirSceptalot> you're welcome
[08:33:19] <SirSceptalot> think of the finger-trapping opportunities
[08:33:24] <PattyCakes> just because it's 2022 doesn't mean you should be reinventing doors
[08:33:31] <PattyCakes> like we got this down folks
[08:33:38] <SirSceptalot> first time a kid goes near that: crushed fingers
[08:33:39] <PattyCakes> no inovation needed
[08:33:40] <PattyCakes> door is door
[08:33:43] <SirSceptalot> lol
[08:33:55] <SirSceptalot> but look at the name PattyCakes 
[08:34:01] <SirSceptalot> it's not reinvented
[08:34:01] <PattyCakes> the gate is neat though, I'll give it that
[08:34:05] <SirSceptalot> IT'S EVOLUTION
[08:34:07] <PattyCakes> the door is absolute hatred
[08:35:06] <SirSceptalot> oh
[08:35:07] <SirSceptalot> PattyCakes, 
[08:35:32] <SirSceptalot> they have the door in a "cut fingers" version too, instead of the fancy "crush fingers" version
[08:35:34] <SirSceptalot> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XOCDLrfwh8
[08:35:41] <monr0e> The door is a lie
[08:36:08] <SirSceptalot> haha
[08:36:14] <SirSceptalot> that video, the way he waslk through it
[08:36:16] <SirSceptalot> "see, it works"
[08:36:37] <PattyCakes> this must be what it's like when you tell someone what you try to explain what you do at work
[08:36:39] <SirSceptalot> 10MM STEEL
[08:36:50] <PattyCakes> because it's just a lot of "huhs" and "whys"
[08:37:08] <PattyCakes> I fucked that sentance up horribly
[08:37:09] <PattyCakes> I should goto bed
[08:37:28] <PattyCakes> I think these doors are lowering my IQ as we speak
[08:37:32] <SirSceptalot> well, you can rest easy knowing that you didn't really order a weird gate after all
[08:37:51] <PattyCakes> hopefully one that's just overengineered as fuck
[08:37:57] <PattyCakes> my HOA is gonna be piiiiiisssssed
[08:38:14] <SirSceptalot> man am I ever glad I never have to deal with those
[08:38:24] <PattyCakes> ours is essentially powerless
[08:38:32] <SirSceptalot> as they should be
[08:38:36] <PattyCakes> I'm within the by-laws, and even if I wasn't, they can't fine me
[08:38:37] <monr0e> The torggler door maybe has a point, its tough and it saves space, but its easy to open and close. I can see some eedjits thinking they wold work in industrial production environments. Its still dangerous as fuck though
[08:38:41] <PattyCakes> they can send it to an attorney
[08:38:47] <PattyCakes> and honestly, would end up just settling anyways
[08:39:05] <PattyCakes> but they won't do that, mainly because the gate will blend in and not be obvious
[08:39:16] <PattyCakes> not to mention there's precedent set of other people doing it
[08:39:37] <PattyCakes> so basically, I didn't ask for permission and probably won't even need to ask for foregiveness lol
[08:39:46] <SirSceptalot> wait
[08:39:58] <SirSceptalot> you actually would need permission if you want to put a gate up?
[08:40:09] <PattyCakes> yup
[08:40:11] <PattyCakes> it's a modification
[08:40:16] <PattyCakes> well wait, maybe not permission
[08:40:18] <PattyCakes> just approval
[08:40:24] <PattyCakes> it's a process to make sure homeowners aren't retards
[08:40:34] <PattyCakes> but this is america and it's my right to be a retard
[08:40:35] <PattyCakes> so fuck off
[08:40:37] <SirSceptalot> lol
[08:40:57] <PattyCakes> seriously though, if I wasn't building withing the established guidelines - there *could* be a problem
[08:41:17] <PattyCakes> we can have fences up to 8ft, with any type of neutral tone wood/paint
[08:41:26] <PattyCakes> basically "wooden fence" is the only stipulation
[08:41:47] <SirSceptalot> eh, up to a certain point I can kinda get it in someplaces, but it just always sounds like HAO's are too anal and dominating about everything
[08:41:49] <PattyCakes> and it doesn't have to be fully wood, you just need wood planks. Some people have steel backed fences
[08:42:23] <PattyCakes> really SirSceptalot, not only are our rules rather common sense - I mean it's essentially "Don't be a dumbass"
[08:42:30] <PattyCakes> and as the resident dumbass, even I don't get too much hate from them
[08:42:33] <PattyCakes> a letter here, a letter there
[08:42:59] <PattyCakes> I attend board meetings, so people know me, and know I'm reasonable. I just sometimes don't clean my driveway up during a project
[08:43:01] <SirSceptalot> I mean, here in Bruges people aren't allowed to do random stuff to their house either. The city of bruges wants to keep their fairy tale look
[08:43:17] <PattyCakes> but like if you're selling your house on my street, I'll obvisouly clean my shit up and make the street look nice
[08:43:22] <PattyCakes> you know, for property values
[08:43:28] <PattyCakes> but once that bitch sells, I'm leaving my shit in the driveway
[08:43:52] <SirSceptalot> the ol' bait'n'switch :p
[08:44:01] <SirSceptalot> it's the house version of sucking in your belly
[08:44:14] <PattyCakes> look, beyond not being amazing to look at - I keep to myself and am friendly
[08:44:20] <PattyCakes> so in general, most people don't fuck with me
[08:44:46] <PattyCakes> we did have a karen on the board at one point, but they sold their shitbox during covid for an obcene amount
[08:45:15] <PattyCakes> all in all, it could be oh so much worse
[08:46:44] <PattyCakes> bad HOAs exist absolutely, but it's not a guarantee. I mean if you live in an established neighborhood, thigns like landscaping in common areas, a community pool or club house, etc all costs money. Someone has to pay for the ammentities 
[08:47:28] <PattyCakes> an HOA can be ran in a hands off way and exists to simply keep the community shit in order
[08:47:51] <SirSceptalot> doesn't the muncipality deal with that?
[08:48:03] <SirSceptalot> oh
[08:48:04] <SirSceptalot> never mind
[08:48:27] <SirSceptalot> I should reply AFTER I actually read what you say
[08:48:37] <PattyCakes> that entirely depends on the area too
[08:48:44] <PattyCakes> some municipalities also do local code enforcement
[08:48:56] <PattyCakes> and instead of a HOME OWNERS association, it's government run
[08:49:27] <SirSceptalot> I didn't mean reinforcing you mow your lawn type of shit, I mean stuff like landcaping the area
[08:49:40] <PattyCakes> or you could hip the triple combo
[08:49:54] <PattyCakes> in a city with city laws, and inside that a township with it's rules, and also in an HOA
[08:50:03] <SirSceptalot> but then I read how you said "common areas" so I guess those are pieces of land that aren't "public" but just private shared by the homeowners
[08:50:11] <PattyCakes> that's what we call the 7th circle of hell
[08:50:21] <SirSceptalot> lol
[08:50:46] <catbeard> anyone that lives in a cul de sac, hows your sac

[08:53:08] <PattyCakes> I wouldn't sign a 30 year loan without being as close to 100% confident 
[08:53:39] <PattyCakes> in many states, buyers during the contract period can attend the meetings (I mean pre covid retard market, now-a-days if it ain't cash today, you ain't buying)

[08:55:08] <SirSceptalot> nono, I got that, I was talking about me suddenly not know the difference between there/their/they're
[08:55:12] <PattyCakes> ah
[08:55:24] <PattyCakes> do they know they're stupid?
[08:55:27] <PattyCakes> does someone tell them?
[08:55:38] <PattyCakes> or are they just blissfully unaware
[08:55:58] <SirSceptalot> I think even if they're told they're still blissfully unaware.
[08:56:19] <PattyCakes> I mean, sympathy for the guy who bought his half an acre 
[08:56:26] <PattyCakes> 40 years ago
[08:56:28] <SirSceptalot> but last time that happened it was in local news, and pretty much all social media was full with "how dumb can you be" so they must have seen that
[08:56:35] <PattyCakes> and ended up getting surrounded by mcmansions
[08:57:08] <PattyCakes> I've seen that kind of shit happen. Old piece of land gets surrounded by new development, and the new owners aren't happy with how that one owner does his thing
[08:57:16] <SirSceptalot> yeah I can get being upset or sueing if you live there first and then they build an airport/slaughterhouse or whatever, but not the other way around
[08:57:21] <PattyCakes> so they try and force him into an HOA
[08:57:34] <SirSceptalot> damn
[08:57:57] <SirSceptalot> and if it's an old person or something they can probably sweet talking him into it and then put the smack down
[08:58:02] <SirSceptalot> "you agreed to this buddy"
[08:58:16] <PattyCakes> yea, wasn't even counting instances were legit fraud happens
[08:58:39] <PattyCakes> and sadly, sometimes that paper trail gets solidified and proving the fraud becomes hard
[08:59:36] <SirSceptalot> we had people moving in next to the racetrack spa-francourchamps a few years back, and then sue the track because there were loud cars
[08:59:38] <PattyCakes> there are some truly unreasonable and insufferable people out there
[09:06:43] <Cl0udNinja> SirSceptalot, that happened in denver for DIA... the old airport used to be in the middle of nowhere, then people built houses nearby, complained, and caused the airport to move. then, they started building houses by the new airport, and soon after, complaints started to arised
[09:07:29] <SirSceptalot> I REALLY don't get why those things get any kind of leverage
[09:07:54] <SirSceptalot> how could any judge not just look at that case, chuckle, and throw the paperwork in the trash?
[09:08:15] <SirSceptalot> then later when someone asks, "oh that was a REAL case? I thought someone was pulling my leg"
[09:08:39] <SirSceptalot> "have them resubmit, so I can throw it in the trash anyway"
[09:08:41] <misspwn> xe0n, i was told to ask if you call a dollar a dollorydoo

[15:33:01] <monr0e> DrZak: It would be futile endeavour. What little air inside would rapidly expand, and the moisture within it would first boil, then become superheated vapour. At some point it would become hot enough to melt the doll, thereby immediately releasing the air and vapour within to the depths of space
[15:33:55] <SirSceptalot> no
[15:34:02] <SirSceptalot> I mean
[15:34:03] <SirSceptalot> yes
[15:34:05] <SirSceptalot> but no
[15:34:59] <SirSceptalot> liquids boil away in a vacuum but not because they become hot, they start to boil because of the pressure drop
[15:36:31] <DrZak> yea, its like boiling water in the mountains
[15:36:42] <DrZak> low pressure, lower boiling
[15:36:44] <DrZak> temperature
[15:37:20] *** Joins: bagpuss_thecat (~bagpuss_t@lodge.glasgownet.com)
[15:38:10] <SirSceptalot> besides, moisture that's dissolved in a gas isn't a liquid, it's simply part of the gas. Gas can't boil, gas is the product of something that boiled
[15:38:29] <SirSceptalot> I do agree with one thing though monr0e: it would be a futile endeavour :D
[15:38:56] <monr0e> The doll itself will also go through the same reaction, or something similar. Plastic is a polymer, and the sort of pvc used in a blow-up doll is unlikely to be a high quality plastic so I would presume a jagged polymer. I would expect such a polymer to become somewhat malleable under space vacuum, essentially melting away - although that part could indeed be wrong
[15:39:44] <monr0e> The rapid expansion of the *gas* against the surface of that doll would then produce a friction reaction, would it not? 
[15:41:26] <SirSceptalot> Do you mean the point at which you're inflating the doll? A gas that's expending loses heat, not gains it. Yes, the gas molecules hitting the polymer would generate a certain amount of heat - just like they do on earth
[15:41:36] <SirSceptalot> but that would likely be quite meaningless in the overal equation
[15:41:52] <SirSceptalot> the biggest downfall of the blow up doll would be the radiation from the sun
[15:42:01] <monr0e> No, I mean at the point the contents of the doll are expanding due to the sudden change in the doll's environment
[15:42:05] <SirSceptalot> it might actually melt, but due to the radiation heat from the sun
[15:42:43] <monr0e> But I'm also getting at the reaction of the polymer itself in space-vacuum
[15:43:26] <monr0e> oh wait I have this completely the wrong way around
[15:43:30] <monr0e> never mind me
[15:43:37] <monr0e> I've been up for 18 hours
[15:43:37] <SirSceptalot> Hm, I'm not sure if any of the componets of blow up doll plastic would dissolve when introduced to a vacuum
[15:44:12] <monr0e> Not dissolve, but most certainly become malleable. Although I was thinking the opposite when I first considered it
[15:44:21] <monr0e> which would be incorrect, I believe
[15:45:36] <SirSceptalot> the most likely scenario is that an "empty" blow-up doll would quickly become "inflated" when introduced to a vacuum, since a doll that seems empty in a 1 bar atmosphere would still have quite some air in it.
[15:46:07] <DrZak> well, plastic in low temperatures is brittle etc
[15:46:11] <DrZak> so thats a factor too
[15:46:25] <SirSceptalot> yes
[15:46:39] <SirSceptalot> the sun-side could melt while the shadow side could freeze I guess
[15:47:06] <SirSceptalot> all in all, we here at #reddit-sysadmin would advice again taking your blow-up doll on a spacewalk

[15:50:18] <SirSceptalot> thank you
[15:50:48] <SirSceptalot> One strange thing that might occur... Suppose you deplete your doll of air first, using a vacuum pump. The sides would "stick/suck" together and you wouldn't be able to seperate them. Once in a vacuum though, there would be no external pressure pushing the sides together, so you could shape it to look as if it were inflated.

[23:29:27] <Hunterkll> have NET30 billing terms with them
[23:30:00] <PublicWiFi> and fs can be nice too
[23:30:05] <Hunterkll> but any regular distributor does
[23:30:13] <PublicWiFi> fs.com
[23:30:40] <Hunterkll> i've never had used/counterfiet from amazon, but you have to know what to look for (sold/shipped by, seller information, etc) 
[23:30:49] <Hunterkll> but most of my computing gear that isn't new comes f rom ebay anyway :D
[23:31:02] <Hunterkll> though i've bought a fair amount of CPUs and RAID controllers from amazon
[23:31:30] <Hunterkll> cables, brackets, cases, low end test graphics cards, NICs, etc....
[23:31:59] <Azem> PublicWiFi: ++
[23:32:01] <Azem> fs.com is awesome 
[23:32:54] <Hunterkll> but otherwise, new bulk cable from newark, equipment usually manufacturers or major distros (CDW, etc - i'm a D&H, sherweb and ingram micro reseller also, etc...

[23:39:00] <Hunterkll> a lot of t imes
[23:39:04] <nx032> when its a $300+ difference is pretty important considering our budget is always tight
[23:39:19] <rpifan> so i finally got one thing done in 3 months at my work
[23:39:21] <rpifan> we got snipe it
[23:40:30] <PublicWiFi> my pants have a hole in the ass
[23:40:32] <PublicWiFi> fml
[23:40:49] <shibboleth> presumably the product/need is of paramount importance, otherwise you wouldn't be paying for it in the first place. are we talking 300 bucks less for the identical product?

[23:41:20] <Hunterkll> shibboleth: yes
[23:41:36] <shibboleth> as in two identical... ipods? or two different kinds of... mp3-players just to keep with the metaphor
[23:41:41] <shibboleth> k
[23:42:11] <Hunterkll> IE: Switch XYZ is $1300 from distro 1, and $1000 from distro 2
[23:42:55] <shibboleth> well, in which case the product/need is of paramount importance and the price+convenience are moderating factors when choosing a supplier
[23:43:00] <shibboleth> k
[23:43:05] <Hunterkll> that being said, I meant more like, if i'm ordering 100 RPi 69's, i'll pay an extra $5 a unit to buy them from my usual source (direct from the manufacturer) instead of a slightly cheaper price at say, adafruit on sa le or something 
[23:43:44] <shibboleth> sure. ideally someone with a retail presence
[23:43:58] <Hunterkll> the manufacturer doesn't have a retail presence 
[23:44:02] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:44:16] <shibboleth> no, but your usual supplier might have
[23:44:38] <rpifan> PublicWiFi, i thought you said you werent fat
[23:44:42] <Hunterkll> my usual supplier is the manufacturer 
[23:44:43] <Hunterkll> :D
[23:44:44] <PublicWiFi> im not lol
[23:44:46] <PublicWiFi> xD
[23:44:48] <Hunterkll> or microcenter if i'm nearby
[23:44:53] <shibboleth> exactly
[23:44:53] <Hunterkll> but they're like 3 steps removed from the mnfr 
[23:44:56] <PublicWiFi> I think its cause I sit criss cross in my chair every day lol
[23:45:05] <Hunterkll> and you have to go direct to farnell for any rpi support
[23:45:10] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> Wish the microcenter in my state was closer.. only tech store i got near me is Bestbuy and they are useless
[23:45:16] <Hunterkll> and the warranty is only through farnell 
[23:45:19] <Hunterkll> etc
[23:45:23] <Hunterkll> might as well buy from farnell
[23:45:26] <shibboleth> Hunterkll, they still employ people whose wages support your community
[23:45:28] <rpifan> PublicWiFi, your pants say otherwise
[23:45:32] <PublicWiFi> rip
[23:45:34] <sd> 04<F​eralTerminator> if not for Amazon/Ebay I wouldnt even get computer parts
[23:45:34] <PublicWiFi> literally
[23:45:56] <Hunterkll> shibboleth: which means fuck all to me when i'm ordering bulk to scalp markets
[23:45:56] <Hunterkll> :D
[23:46:07] <Hunterkll> also microcenter's like 30 miles away
[23:47:11] <Hunterkll> i go there with price matches in hand and a store credit card that makes them eat the sales tax 
[23:47:24] <Hunterkll> so they probably lose money on me if it wasn't for all the fuckin' bawls i buy 
[23:47:25] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:47:33] <Molnija> rip
[23:47:41] <Molnija> >scalping
[23:47:48] <sintax> Hunterkll: i'm closer to a microcenter. do i win?
[23:48:02] <shibboleth> speaking of micro center, remember the mr robot ep where elliot had to get new gear to mitnick-trace the phone-call/text
[23:48:02] <Hunterkll> Molnija: Got a batch of RPi 4's coming in next month that i'm gonna flip on ebay for probably more than 2x what i pay per unit 
[23:48:03] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:48:05] <rpifan> Hunterkll, is there a way to synchronize user accounts between gsuite and azure but keeping gsuite as the identity provider?
[23:48:15] <shibboleth> does microcenter actually have warehouse on manhattan?
[23:48:18] <shibboleth> a
[23:48:22] <shibboleth> in
[23:48:24] <Hunterkll> no idea
[23:48:26] <rpifan> on in around 
[23:48:27] <Molnija> Hunterkll: why? what's the point?
[23:48:32] <Hunterkll> wouldn't surprise me, lots of companies do
[23:48:35] <Hunterkll> Molnija: to make money?
[23:48:38] <Molnija> some people have zero morals
[23:48:38] <Hunterkll> rpifan: sure, but then you lose a shitload of flexibility 
[23:48:54] <Hunterkll> Molnija: i put my order in to the supply chain queue, get it when my allotment ships, then throw 'em on ebay
[23:49:18] <shibboleth> Hunterkll, well, space is at a premium and you'd typically find brick-and-mortars outside of the city center. meaning 30 miles isn't unreasonable
[23:49:22] <Hunterkll> Molnija: at one point i was slinging rpi 3B kits for $40-70 each that I paid average of $5/kit for (including pi, psu, sd card, heatsinks, sometime with caes, etc)
[23:49:32] <rpifan> Hunterkll, thats fine its what i need at the moment, got any guidese on how to do it?
[23:49:36] <Molnija> wildin'
[23:49:40] <Hunterkll> rpifan: no idea
[23:49:56] <Molnija> just goes to show you what capitalism does
[23:50:16] <Hunterkll> Molnija: not my fault newark (farnell's distribution arm) marked down a fuckton of 3B kits and i ordered a few hundred
[23:50:27] <Hunterkll> and then sold them at hamfests/flea markets for fair cash prices
[23:50:28] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:50:39] <sintax> good lord this afternoon is draaaaaaaaaaaaaaaging 
[23:51:10] <yuken> Hunterkll, alright. I'm getting a whole bunch of steel wool and some motor oil, and going to town on this rust.
[23:51:18] <yuken> Then I need to figure out how to treat it, so it doesn't rust again..
[23:51:20] <Hunterkll> electrolysis....
[23:52:23] <yuken> Not possible, Hunterkll.
[23:52:34] <Hunterkll> the fuck you mean
[23:52:44] <Hunterkll> rpifan: a quick google shows that google has a guide on it
[23:52:45] <yuken> ... I don't have a container suitable for that.
[23:52:45] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:53:03] <Hunterkll> you don't have a bucket
[23:53:06] <yuken> uh
[23:53:11] <yuken> I don't have a bucket 36" in depth, no.
[23:53:17] <Hunterkll> so do half a t a time
[23:53:17] <yuken> You got a bucket 36" in depth?
[23:53:24] <Hunterkll> don't have to fuckin' one shot it
[23:54:07] <yuken> I also need a power supply.
[23:54:12] <yuken> If I want to do electrolysis.
[23:54:33] <Hunterkll> constant current car battery charger
[23:54:38] <yuken> I don't have one of those.
[23:54:40] <Hunterkll> is what we use for the jerry cans
[23:54:43] <Hunterkll> well they're p retty cheap
[23:54:46] <Hunterkll> but
[23:54:56] <Hunterkll> yuken: this guy on  youtube uses a fricken flower planter 
[23:54:57] <yuken> Surely a DC power supply will work fine.
[23:54:59] <Hunterkll> those are dirt ass cheap
[23:55:00] <Hunterkll> lol
[23:55:10] <yuken> yes Hunterkll, that's what I was going to do to blue it.
[23:55:17] <Hunterkll> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDM69iNaI_8
[23:55:33] <Hunterkll> and yes, a constant current designed power supply will work 
[23:55:37] <Hunterkll> you ahve to be able to control the current
[23:55:44] <Hunterkll> not have like a fuckin laptop power adapter that'll overload and shut off
[23:55:44] <Molnija> isn't electrolysis what they do to trans women's beards
[23:56:02] <yuken> https://www.amazon.com/Kungber-Adjustable-Switching-Regulated-Adjustments/dp/B08DJ1FDXV/
[23:56:11] <rpifan> well i looked but it said it iwll stop working with gauth
[23:56:13] <Hunterkll> lol.....
[23:56:17] <yuken> although
[23:56:21] <yuken> that's the cheapest thing in Amazon, it's probably shit.
[23:56:28] <Hunterkll> yuken: i have that supply (or one under a different name) i use for powering radios and whatnot
[23:56:37] <Hunterkll> car battery charger will be cheaper and available locally
[23:57:01] <Hunterkll> i use like a 20 year old sears unit
[23:57:40] <Hunterkll> you want a dumb one too, not a smart unit
[23:58:19] <yuken> egh
[23:58:26] <yuken> I'd need to go to some store to pick one up locally Hunterkll
[23:58:41] <Hunterkll> don't want one that has like, over/under volt protection and shit like that
[23:58:50] <Hunterkll> just a dumb as bricks current limited battery charger
[23:59:18] <yuken> I might as well grab a power supply from Amazon since I need a bore brush and rod anyway.
