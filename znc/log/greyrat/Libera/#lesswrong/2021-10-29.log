[00:00:03] <spxtr> why is that?
[00:00:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Dunno, but it's easy to verify - try it
[00:00:34] <spxtr> I don't have multiple mashers to try it with :P
[00:00:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, I can't do anything about that :p
[00:01:04] <spxtr> it just seems like intuitively if you make the arms into wider ribbons then they'll give more support away from the center
[00:01:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> All I can tell you is that the circular-profile arms on the older masher are extremely sturdy
[00:01:26] <spxtr> I would guess that's because they used more metal and/or had better bonding to the plate
[00:01:34] <spxtr> or used steel vs something lighter
[00:01:37] * Obormot\Arcturus shrug
[00:02:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Anyway the main stress point on the flat-arm design isn't where the arms attach to the disk, it's where the arms attach to the handle / each other
[00:02:36] <rmmh> is Obormot\Arcturus talking about potato mashers again
[00:02:37] <spxtr> yeah that's probably true, I would guess the disk attachment is quite strong for both
[00:03:17] <rmmh> the flat masher appears to have a deeper/better connected tang
[00:04:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: Yes, that's the flaw I just described to aweinstock, read up
[00:04:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: But note that the impression that the flat-armed masher is superior in this regard is deceptive, because - also read up :p

[00:58:25] <snav> this is kinda cute post, definitely the most direct expression of Yudkowsky's positivism i've seen
[00:59:37] <gwern> (psychedelics probably works better if we forbade anyone who wanted to take them from taking them, and made those who didn't take some)
[00:59:48] <snav> i actually disagree with Yud here: "understanding the engine of thought may be a little more complicated than understanding a steam engine—but it is not a fundamentally different task"
[01:00:55] <PlanckWalk> I expect it's not fundamentally different, but might be wrong.
[01:02:20] <snav> my claim is that the difference lies in the fact that we must use our mind to perceive our mind, which means that, to some extent, the map is/constructs the territory. whereas with a steam engine, the object remains stable across your inspection.
[01:02:30] <PlanckWalk> All the evidence so far seems to point toward it not being fundamentally different
[01:02:58] <Obormot\Gaia> snav: If you try to understand someone else's mind instead of your own, the analogy holds perfectly
[01:03:03] <PlanckWalk> Oh, that' more a practical difficulty than a fundamental difference.
[01:03:05] <Obormot\Gaia> snav: Then they can do the same to you
[01:03:23] <Obormot\Gaia> snav: And more generally, the answer to your criticism is Dennett's heterophenomenology
[01:03:33] <snav> the problem is that i have no immediate access to another person's mind in the same way that i do to my own
[01:03:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> But you don't need it, is the thing
[01:03:50] <snav> let me read about heterophenomenology
[01:03:53] <PlanckWalk> You don't have immediate access to most of your own
[01:03:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also true!
[01:04:33] <snav> i have the capacity to perform the phenomenological reduction, which means i can produce knowledge of a fundamentally different sort than if i were trying to understand the other, but i do agree that it's probably easier to study others' minds
[01:05:30] <snav> heterophenomenology seems like it's addressing a problem that was already addressed early in the development of phenomenology, but then subsequently... forgotten?
[01:05:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, that often happens
[01:05:42] <snav> it also seems to be reproducing psychoanalysis, LMFAO
[01:05:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok now that's not true at all.
[01:06:13] <snav> this is absolutely Freud's methodology
[01:06:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not
[01:06:20] <PlanckWalk> If you're of a solipsist bent then you can suppose that yours is the only mind in the universe and the rest are merely behaviours of brains, but that seems pointless.
[01:06:32] <snav> Obormot\Arcturus: can you justify that at all?
[01:06:34] <pompolic> what i was talking about above, i guess, is establishing a mapping between my phenomenological knowledge and abstract models
[01:06:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> snav: Maybe but not right now, sorry
[01:06:51] <pompolic> "ah yes <experience> is what <description> feels like from the inside"
[01:06:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> snav: I'll just say that you should read Dennett directly on the subject
[01:07:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> _Consciousness Explained_ is an excellent book and I recommend it
[01:07:29] <snav> I am really down on modern theory of mind/consciousness
[01:08:00] <PlanckWalk> Which ones?
[01:08:01] <snav> in general i find their selection of frames... not so compelling
[01:08:07] <PlanckWalk> Oh, all of them?
[01:08:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's mostly dross, but then that's true of most fields, as we are increasingly finding out
[01:08:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Dennett is a standout, in my experience

[01:17:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, there's always arguing with people on the internet
[01:18:02] <kuudes> people! if your bmi is >=25, you are eligible for booster!
[01:18:06] <kuudes> (in usa)
[01:18:20] <kuudes> "Overweight (defined as a body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2 but < 30 kg/m2), obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2 but < 40 kg/m2), or severe obesity (BMI of ≥40 kg/m2), can make you more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19.  The risk of severe COVID-19 illness increases sharply with elevated BMI."

[01:20:25] <saturn2> being depressed makes you more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19??
[01:20:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: No but justice demands that we help depressed people not be sick more urgently
[01:20:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or... something, I dunno

[01:23:23] <kuudes> I guess poverty could be included, but eh...

[04:50:12] <quanticle> gwern: w.r.t. demand-driven shortages, I think part of it is also the persistently high prices of Ethereum (and other crypto). My intuition is that the reason chip manufacturers didn't rush to build fabs is because they were expecting a boom and a bust, like what happened with the last two crypto cycles (which ended up with a *lot* of decent used GPUs flooding the market)
[04:50:39] <quanticle> So when demand went up, they were conservative about immediately expanding capacity to meet it

[05:06:59] <|dbotdan> Google AI (@GoogleAI, 2021-10-29 00:03): ‘#Pathways is a new #ML architecture that will let us train a single model to accomplish thousands or millions of tasks, across modalities - while consuming much less energy than typical models do today. Learn more at http://goo.gle/3jHFST5, and in the TED Talk below.’
[05:16:39] <PapuaHardyNet> fuck I just binge watched re zero s2
[05:19:12] <PapuaHardyNet> whoaaa, this pathways thing sounds incredible
[05:21:51] <gwern> well, dean was really hyped about it several months ago, which is why I kept mentioning it even though no details were available. where there is smoke there is fire

[05:34:47] <gwern> bah, this blog post and talk is useless
[05:35:07] <gwern> we already knew pathways was a giant sparse multimodal model which would be used for many tasks
[05:35:20] <gwern> most of the talk is just a history lesson and advertorial for 'responsible ai' -_-
[05:37:18] <nshepperd2> is it just rebranded perceiver io
[05:37:29] <gwern> nah. you know google brain and deepmind don't get along

[05:48:42] <gwern> yeah. herbert's attitude towards human mutability and the desirability of change and enhancement... could hardly be more repugnant to tolkien, who doesn't want hobbiton to change the slightest bit
[05:52:00] <rmmh> also his suspicion of heros
[05:52:03] <rmmh> and religions
[05:53:16] <gwern> yes, the whole 'bene gesserit going around planting catholic-like propaganda religions' bit probably didn't enhance his pleasure
[05:53:31] <gwern> I mean, they *do* come off as rather jesuitical...
[05:55:23] <gwern> really, there are so many things that he could've hated, I regret he didn't specify which to allay our curiosity
[06:03:22] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: how about 1.1em? at least on this page then the patreon link lines up with the ToC: https://www.gwern.net/docs/www/misc/xwd-16354747394179259.png which is nice, barring some sort of careful rejiggering to increase the logo size and line up the header/logo and sidebar links/description

The oil drillers might agree! 'We’re gonna drill for oil for 10

[17:05:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> As for the HN post, he's partially right, but he misses the steelman of #2, and thus fails to realize that it's combinable with #3

[17:18:37] <pompolic> >virtual reality was always dystopian
[17:18:40] <pompolic> i think this is bullshit
[17:19:14] <PapuaHardyNet> it is. the entire premise of a virtual reality presupposes the idea that physical reality is not enough
[17:19:53] <pompolic> it is bullshit, or it is dystopian?
[17:20:06] <PapuaHardyNet> there are also other ethical principles that underlie the statement "virtual reality was always dystopian" though, so there's more to it
[17:20:19] <pompolic> right
[17:20:33] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[17:21:08] <pompolic> to explain my argument, consider: "novels were always dystopian. it's what happens when we don't have a frontier and turn inwards to fantasy and isolation"
[17:21:31] <pompolic> or: "video games were always dystopian. it's what happens when we don't have a frontier and turn inwards to fantasy and isolation"
[17:21:35] <pompolic> it's a _medium_
[17:21:53] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, I am of two minds when it comes to novels, video games, and anime
[17:22:14] <PapuaHardyNet> on one hand, I consider them art forms, and I collect them because they are unique and it is a tragedy if they are lost
[17:22:31] <PapuaHardyNet> also as an art piece, it is part of the culture I inhabit
[17:22:46] <pompolic> when you think about it, most video games nowadays are microtransaction-based hellholes
[17:23:14] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: I'm talking Bioshock Infinite, DOOM eternal, Cyberpunk 2077, come on man
[17:23:27] <PapuaHardyNet> we are assuming some minimum quality thresholds here
[17:23:33] <pompolic> i should rephrase
[17:23:44] <pompolic> rather than "most", i should say, the most popular series
[17:23:48] <pompolic> Call of Duty if i recall

[17:24:23] <pompolic> i don't think this is the medium's fault
[17:24:37] <PapuaHardyNet> pompolic: for our current context, where we are looking at experience machine-lites, we cannot count pure Pavlovian "games"
[17:24:47] <PapuaHardyNet> we are looking at things that immerse you into it

[18:06:28] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : So apparently roomba-esque bots have apps that show you your house layout that it has mapped. And apparently people actually screenshot those images and upload them to social media. Seems like a terrible idea, but what do I know?
[18:07:11] <feep> two2thehead: makes sense
[18:07:35] <feep> two2thehead: I mean, who cares? it's an apartment, the layouts are reused frequently
[18:07:42] <feep> not like the bot knows where your valuables are
[18:08:02] <two2thehead> I was thinking along the lines of a robber or a stalker
[18:08:41] <feep> I don't think the house layout is very important for that
[18:09:17] <feep> two2thehead: for instance, here's mine https://i.imgur.com/T2vfwwb.png
[18:09:32] <feep> so like, the only thing this gives you is ... like, if you want to steal my botvac in 20 seconds or less
[18:10:28] <feep> there's just not enough detail there that the layout gives you anything useful
[18:11:41] <gwern> quanticle: removing background audio would fall under 'source separation', I think. that's gotten pretty good, I expect it could be done if you jiggered with a released model

[18:30:33] <two2thehead> sorry, I was afk
[18:30:50] <kuudes> bottom room is kichen/living room, isn't it?

[18:33:17] <feep> don't see how it would hepl
[18:33:21] <feep> help*
[18:33:30] <feep> well, that makes sense tho
[18:33:36] <feep> if you already sorta know where
[18:33:39] <feep> but this is a standard layout
[18:33:55] <kuudes> so your valuables are in the top right room?

[18:34:06] <kuudes> you have no valuables?

[18:34:26] <feep> yep
[18:34:31] <feep> you literally considered all other rooms first
[18:34:43] <gwern> 'we can see that the couch is here, and the only apartment with a corner layout on the third floor is #343, and if we reuse the street view, we can confirm which of the 4 block buildings it is and which quarter of the city it is in; elsewhere in a tweet they mention a certain cafe which is nearest to 1 of the 4; qed, they live in #343, 1010 la rue de opsec paris'
[18:34:43] <feep> this is why these maps are useless or even counterproductive
[18:35:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: The reason is spacing. Visual separation. Things do not look good bunched up.
[18:35:00] * two2thehead saves this in onenote as scifi writing inspiration
[18:35:09] <feep> gwern: yes, from an opsec perspective it's maybe ... 5 bits or so?
[18:35:21] <kuudes> why do you keep your valuables in living room? trophies or something?
[18:35:32] <feep> kuudes: uh, where else would I keep them
[18:35:35] <feep> it's where I live ..
[18:35:36] <gwern> hard to say. in some cases layout might be a total break. in other cases, useless. no idea how it'd average and it depends on all the auxiliary info
[18:35:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: The Strugatskys' sf is in many ways unlike Western stuff. I recommend reading it
[18:35:52] <kuudes> yeah
[18:36:04] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah but there is definitely a thing as too much spacing. maybe I should do a twitter poll for a third opinion
[18:36:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: This is not too much
[18:36:37] <two2thehead> speaking of anonymity bits, how many bits of data do I need to positively ID someone in a population of half a million?
[18:36:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: btw, you realize that it Patreon won't line up with the TOC on every page, right? It's just coincidence that it did with that spacing on that page
[18:36:52] * two2thehead checks 33bits
[18:37:10] <kuudes> half a million?
[18:37:10] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: doesn't line up with anything consistently now but at least the spacing would be better with less
[18:37:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Also, come on, you know better than to do this sort of "design by survey"

[18:39:38] <rmmh> "the radical new building concept calls for an 11-story, 1.68-million-square-foot structure that would house up to 4,500 students, 94 percent of whom would not have windows in their small, single-occupancy bedrooms"
[18:43:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Good god, that looks more dismal than any dorm I've lived in or seen
[18:44:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> It looks like an incarceration facility
[18:44:50] <PapuaHardyNet> they aren't students.
[18:44:51] <rmmh> problem: dorms are too much fun and encourage sex
[18:44:56] <PapuaHardyNet> they are cash cows
[18:45:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh my god, those rooms
[18:45:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> And those beds D:
[18:45:17] <rmmh> absolutely NO sex
[18:45:25] <rmmh> I wonder if those beds are 6'
[18:45:29] <PapuaHardyNet> if only sex was that easy
[18:45:32] <rmmh> it would be consistent
[18:48:47] <PapuaHardyNet> is it "was that easy" or "were that easy"?
[18:48:58] <PapuaHardyNet> is sex a singular or a plural?
[18:49:38] <nshepperd2> i think it's always 'were'
[18:49:55] <nshepperd2> bc subjunctive or something
[18:49:58] <pompolic> *arbiter voice* were it so easy
[18:50:13] <nshepperd2> exactly
[18:50:54] <pompolic> what i don't know if there's a difference between "if only X was/were <adjective>" and "were it <adjective>"
[18:51:00] <pompolic> is if there's*
[18:53:34] <pompolic> so apparently a) there's no difference, b) subjunctive mood is always "were" (i.e. when expressing a counterfactual)
[18:53:45] <rmmh> it's funny how micro-apartments are nearly universally banned by cities and NIMBYs except for 1) dorms and 2) prisons
[18:54:08] <rmmh> all humans should be either homeless or have 400sq ft dedicated to them, except for students. they'll do fine with a 50sqft room
[18:54:33] <gwern> rmmh: dorms aren't much different from bedrooms at home for children historically
[18:54:56] <rmmh> yeah, those old houses with 10 bedrooms that are closet sized
[18:57:05] <PapuaHardyNet> why did people have so many children? I need to read more about this
[18:57:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Because children were profit centers, not cost centers as they are now
[18:57:39] <rmmh> turns out when you combine "no birth control" and "spousal rape is impossible",
[18:57:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Kids were additional laborers
[18:57:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was net positive to have more
[18:58:05] <PapuaHardyNet> so things changed due to higher cost of education and real estate?
[18:58:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Kids could start contributing to e.g. farm chores at a young age
[18:58:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Things changed due to a lot of things
[18:58:20] <rmmh> and banning child labor
[18:58:30] <rmmh> child labor on a farm was the norm forever
[18:58:39] <rmmh> child labor in a factory was somehow even more dangerous and horrible
[18:59:03] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, I recall Oliver Twist
[18:59:29] <PapuaHardyNet> the quintessential "American dream" novel tbh
[18:59:30] <rmmh> really though # of children can be pretty directly modeled by a woman's education level and access to contraceptives

[22:28:45] <gwern> '00:57:13 We need to find ways to go faster with that, but, you know, there’s a lot of value that should just come simple little talk. Something I did recently where I saw someone make internally make -they had a big post about how to capture stereo scopic video from inside VR. I was like, how did they do that? We don’t actually save that out and I was horrified to find that they actually...
[22:28:45] <rmmh> I thought a donation with no promised return would be safer
[22:28:51] <gwern> ...did a full record of the distorted 2-eye view and undistorted that to make a stereo video which we could then play back and I’m like, oh, my God, that’s just horrible. That’s not the way you should do something but they cared enough to do that and they knew getting it through our full system design process it just wasn’t going to happen and rise to the top. That was the type of...
[22:28:57] <gwern> ...thing where it was not that hard. I took an afternoon and it took a few hours for me to go in and put the real way to do that, but it’s controlled by a system PREF that you have to set over ADV right now where I would love to get in a in an advanced settings option and all the record things, but that’s going to be a thing that will take six months for us to wind up getting something...
[22:29:03] <gwern> ...like that done. We need to figure out how to move faster on so many of those things. We have more than WE HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH PEOPLE WORKING ON ALL OF THESE FEATURES, BUT WE TRIP OVER OUR OWN FEET IN SO MANY WAYS.'

[23:15:55] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : "Even after the area was populated since only a small number of cover points are ever in the right position to actually provide cover from the target at a given time testing, only a handful of them on demand usually resulted in failure. As a result terrorists weren't able to take advantage of the system as well as they should have and sometimes they never use cover at all. What we needed was a way to prepare and analyze cover 
[23:15:56] <two2thehead> in advance before it was requested so it would be ready to go when an npc eventually did need it.
[23:15:56] <two2thehead> we could have accomplished this by just placing static cover by hand instead but we didn't want to lose the ability to respond to changes in the nav mesh so our approach was to transition 'cover generation and analysis' from an on-demand service to a 'persistent background job'. When combat begins agents register themselves with the cover manager and specify a target, and as long as at least one agent is registered the cover manager will 
[23:15:58] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, yes, it is
[23:15:59] <two2thehead> incrementally analyze the nav mesh around them in its own thread, as well as check the line of fire from generated cover points to the target.
[23:16:02] <two2thehead> Here you can see the status of cover generation as nav mesh tiles are analyzed. red tiles have generated partial cover results while blue tiles have finished analysis. and those that contain at least one cover point are highlighted in light blue. later when an agent finally does request a cover point we simply return these cache results to the cover manager that is that it's been preparing for us."
