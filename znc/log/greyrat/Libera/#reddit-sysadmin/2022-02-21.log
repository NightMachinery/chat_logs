[04:42:53] <sideup66> what i dont get im looking at now
[04:43:25] <sideup66> im using an old lenovo thinkpad from work (retired box) as a roadwarrior/shitposting machine and for some reason despite the battery being SHOT this thing still achieves good battery life
[04:43:35] <sideup66> according to ubuntu im only geting about 72% capacity
[04:43:54] <sideup66> and my phone has 74 (oneplus) yet can get north of 4 hours sot from a charge
[04:44:15] <Cl0udNinja> usually the battery circuitry starts to complain when it gets below 80% max capacity, and in most cases, the system should disable it
[04:44:59] <sideup66> they become fireballs or something after 80% wear? i thought it was just a matter of crap life

[09:53:09] <Kiernian|Work> IIRC the declared root cause of the problem had something to do with the load balancing appliances, which were the networking team's job, not the windows server team's job. I don't think it even got as far as a proposal for a CAB, both teams just "not my job"'d it and let it keep happening.
[09:55:03] <Kiernian|Work> so even though restarting the dfs service fixed the issue temporarily, it wasn't the cause. I think there was also an issue with something authoritative in AD because taking out one server's DFS service shouldn't have affected everyone.

I can get my way around setting up the workflow, and would like people to enter their AAD creeentials when connecting to our Wi-Fi. But to my understanding if someone has a rogue AP and calls their AP the same way as ours, a ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù user could try to connect to the rogue AP. How do you get around this security issue ?
[22:25:02] <DrZak> get a consultant to do it
[22:26:34] <DrZak> but if you want to do it, here's a howto - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/auth-radius
[22:26:43] <DrZak> you can get it licked in like 2 weeks
[22:32:56] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> Oof just found some random application we're hosting internally that's HTTP basic auth.
[22:33:12] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> No cert or SSO or anything. Just HTTP basic auth
[22:36:39] <DrZak> of course, who would bother with security, its so annoying
[22:36:50] <DrZak> also, updatng an 'app' more often then once in 20 years

[22:39:40] <DrZak> radius through on premise requires ad
[22:40:46] <DrZak> but if you have some different method on installing some 3rd party radius server that can connect to azure ad
[22:40:51] <DrZak> and use JUST azure ad

They are suggesting that I go with the R440 with H750 cards -- and will discount them a bit for me.  The H750 is pretty much the same as the H755, so no issue there.  Any issue going with the R440 over the R350?  They are selling them to me for less and even the the H440 is a generation behind, they

[23:38:17] <signofzeta> I did get a holiday, but I can't take it today.

[23:40:56] <signofzeta> It's a regular Monday for me, just an hour late.  (I usually work 7am-4pm Pacific Time, UTC-8.  Today, I'm 8-5.  But I'm on the east coast, so it's 11-8.)
[23:44:31] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> Any have any opinion on ProxySQL?
[23:47:31] <Cl0udNinja> bdenlinger it works; but if you use temporary tables you're in for a world of hell
[23:48:32] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> My use case is a read only replica for reporting connectors.
[23:49:18] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> Is there a better solution? I'd like to avoid exposing the DB directly to the internet.
[23:49:29] <Cl0udNinja> I worked for a place that made a POS app / system, and the DB query shit was a clusterfuck. I eventually created 5 readonly slave clusters for various query types, and a single master, we had to do some fuckery to make the proxysql work properly for us because of all the temp tables, as query A may go to system B, but sub query B of A may go to another
[23:50:17] <Cl0udNinja> I'm confused on your usecase
[23:50:59] <Cl0udNinja> you just want a replica thats used for reporting tools?
[23:51:33] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> BAs have reporting tools that generate extracts based on queries. Basic ETL pipeline stuff. I'm migrating the prod DB to Azure and need someway to either sync back to their env or provide a proxy for the pipeline connections.
[23:51:44] <Cl0udNinja> proxysql has no protections or anything extra in the security area, its basically just a DB loadbalancer
[23:52:06] <Cl0udNinja> do you have a VPN?
[23:52:15] <Cl0udNinja> S2S VPN between HQ and Azure I mean
[23:53:14] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> yea that was the other alternative but our ops team is shit
[23:53:28] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> so setting up the gateway will probably be a pain
[23:54:10] <Cl0udNinja> yeah I mean thats the 'right way'. otherwise just firewall the fuck out of the replica system so that only HQ public IP can reach it at all
[23:54:42] <Cl0udNinja> proxysql wont help you any for your case, just setup regular replication and provide them a readonly user
[23:54:59] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> Dang PII data too
[23:55:08] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> sec team will probably have a shit fit
