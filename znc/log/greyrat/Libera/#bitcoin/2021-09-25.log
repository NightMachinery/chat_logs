[03:54:58] <as2334> CryptoExchange so your flawed premise is that you allegedly want to 'maximize profits'
[03:56:32] <CryptoExchange> i'm not sure how thats a flawed premise
[03:56:44] <as2334> anyway I certainly sympathize with the idea of cash deals using anonymous networks(tor haha), but it has implementation problems
[03:57:35] <as2334> CryptoExchange you might 'do better' if you don't scam but so what. You may also choose quicker fraudulent profits.
[03:58:23] <as2334> the premise that people would do whatever 'maximizes profits' is flawed
[03:59:41] <CryptoExchange> i'm not saying people would do whatever maximizes profits, i'm saying thats what i'm doing
[03:59:57] <as2334> and there's no reason to believe you
[04:00:16] <CryptoExchange> i 100% agree with you. it could be a scam but i'm telling you that its not. theres nothing i can say to convince you otherwise, its not meant for everyone. its for people that want to do an anonymous transaction quickly. hopefully one day i will build up a reputation

[06:14:03] <Victorsueca> CryptoExchange: I think as2334 is concerned about how the IRC protocol makes user's IPs visible by default. So if the server at xxx.xxx.36.111 is just a proxy, then good for you (although someone with authority could still ask the hosting provider for logs). But if that's the same IP as your main server or your personal IP address, then it's not so anonymous anymore.
