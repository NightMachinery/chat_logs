[02:17:11] <rawktucc> anyone on?
[02:17:24] * ThePendulum hides
[02:21:27] <ThePendulum> yo wtf I want porn star internet like that https://twitter.com/ShawnaLeneeShow/status/1490114505547857930
[02:21:58] <ThePendulum> I didn't think there was any wifi tech commercially available that fast
[02:22:49] <rawktucc> I have that
[02:22:54] <rawktucc> but 1.5gbit down and 1gbit upload
[02:22:59] <ThePendulum> on wifi?
[02:23:00] <rawktucc> you can get those speeds over wifi with AX
[02:23:03] <rawktucc> no, ethernet
[02:23:05] <ThePendulum> I see
[02:23:11] <rawktucc> also, those speeds are nothing compared to 25Gbit in switzerland
[02:23:12] <sarnold> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_6
[02:23:18] <rawktucc> I hate wifi 6
[02:23:26] <rawktucc> I think it's going to degrade our privacy even more
[02:24:19] <rawktucc> I wonder if I could rent a rack in a swiss datacenter and get 25gbit
[02:24:22] <rawktucc> and just rent out servers

[02:35:39] <joepie91> rawktucc: <Clippy voice> I see you're considering starting a hosting company. would you like to learn more about the misery involved in doing such?
[02:35:45] <rawktucc> YES
[02:35:47] <rawktucc> SUBSCRIBE
[02:35:51] <rawktucc> go ahead
[02:35:53] <joepie91> heh :p
[02:36:43] <joepie91> well, the short version (gotta go to bed soon) is that it's generally an extremely low-margin industry with extremely demanding customers, you will be spending the first several years doing around-the-clock customer support with basically no holidays unless you have a serious bag of money to hire support folks upfront
[02:37:16] <joepie91> there are some exceptions, mainly if you have a specific niche where you can charge more, but that requires you to have connections in an industry of some kind, usually

[02:37:32] <sarnold> ,bef
[02:37:32] <unfinity> sarnold you befriended a duck in 5.695 seconds! You have made friends with 116 ducks in #datahoarder.
[02:37:33] <joepie91> basically, people get into hosting because they enjoy doing hosting, not to pay the bills
[02:37:34] <joepie91> ,bef
[02:37:34] <unfinity> You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.
[02:37:39] <sarnold> aww sorry joepie91 
[02:37:42] <joepie91> :p

[02:37:57] *** Quits: Lucanis (~Lucanis@user/lucanis) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:38:02] <joepie91> but yeah, bottom line, there's a reason hosting companies tend to get bought out after a couple of years :p
[02:38:16] *** Joins: Lucanis (~Lucanis@user/lucanis)
[02:38:24] <joepie91> also all the line-of-business software for hosting sucks at least 50% more than you are expecting
[02:39:59] <joepie91> of course, none of this is a deterrent if you enjoy the work a lot, but it's not easy money, is what I'm saying
[02:41:11] <rawktucc> i have a question about where to put 100TB, should i wait until you wake up tomorrow or can I PM you

[13:57:16] <joepie91> ideally it would have at least some protocol/port-based QoS capabilities, but I don't really need any advanced features besides that. I just want a plug-and-play thing that gives me reliable network, basically
