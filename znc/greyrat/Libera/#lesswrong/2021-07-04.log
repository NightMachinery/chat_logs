[00:05:24] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: public property fields as opposed to methods
[00:05:48] <feep> um, this makes sense in languages that have a clear OOP/POD separation
[00:05:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Like ... publicly accessible instance member variables?
[00:06:01] <feep> yeah
[00:06:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok yes this is bad
[00:06:28] <feep> like, my point is, I know this is parody, but ...
[00:06:41] <feep> "randian" design actually ends up not that far from proper software design
[00:06:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> I ask because in Objective C, "property" refers to the interface to some (possibly not actually variable-backed) field
[00:06:58] <feep> ooh
[00:07:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which is implemented by (possibly compiler-synthesized) getter/setter methods
[00:07:09] <feep> well, I'd still argue it's kinda iffy
[00:07:15] <feep> you're mutating object state on the fly
[00:07:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or ... not
[00:07:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can make them readonly
[00:07:26] <saturn2> it's not a very good parody
[00:07:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you want
[00:07:28] <feep> if the most your object can say about its data is that "it can be set"
[00:07:38] <feep> you probably have some design deficiencies, is my point
[00:07:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> ???
[00:07:44] * feep is *all* for readonly properties.
[00:07:54] <feep> I'm just iffy on setters.
[00:08:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> But why
[00:08:16] <feep> like, I don't think they're always bad, I just sorta look at them with suspicion
[00:08:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's weird
[00:08:33] <feep> cause :waves hands: encapsulation :waves hands: methods should represent object verbs
[00:08:40] <kuudes> yeah, "lock on write" seems sort of natural to me as well
[00:08:53] <feep> :waves hands: objects should be something qualitatively different from their data 
[00:09:28] <feep> hence if the most you can say about your state is that 'it can be set', you are probably dealing with an anemic object
[00:09:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> What does that mean - "objects should be something qualitatively different from their data"
[00:09:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> And what does it mean to "say" things about your state

[00:10:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Cool, give some examples :p
[00:10:34] <feep> thinking
[00:10:40] <dbohdan> That's Alan Kay and Rich Hickey arguing
[00:11:53] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: okay, the classic example is whatever, you have a person class, a person has a name, a social security number, and an age, right?
[00:12:11] <feep> so say you're in a context where you want to implement age gating
[00:13:19] <feep> suddenly your person is more than just a collection of fields, it has to actually accumulate ... like, for instance, you might add a field country and have a method canViewNsfw() that checks age and country
[00:13:38] <feep> or you can kick off a verification process and check verification state through the person instance
[00:13:40] *** Joins: filipepe (uid362247@id-362247.tooting.irccloud.com)
[00:13:53] <feep> what you probably shouldn't do is have a field "isLegal" and have some process that sets it to "true"
[00:14:33] <feep> because then by oop design, that process "wants" to live in the class. what if it needs some additional state that only concerns that one function? you have to add it to the person - *and also make it public*. you have to cut your person class full of holes, because its domain logic lives outside itself.
[00:14:35] <feep> that's an anemic class.
[00:15:18] <feep> you picked up a person class in the first place because you didn't want to think about what goes into someone being able to see nsfw content
[00:15:28] <feep> you just wanted something representing the user that you could ask for this info
[00:16:02] <feep> in that sense, any writable instance variable is a danger sign that the class has core domain logic - *mutating* domain logic - that lives outside itself.
[00:17:54] <feep> that's what I meant by "objects are something different than their data" - a person is more than an age and a name and a country, from the *domain* view a person is a thing that can tell you if it is allowed to view nsfw content
[00:18:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: The Objective C way would be to have a field isLegal (or, just, "legal"), have it be read-only, and have it be backed not by an instance variable but by some method that does whatever computation and returns boolean
[00:18:37] <feep> whether it uses country identifier or email validation or whether it has a scanned passport is not something you, the api user, care about.
[00:18:44] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: right.
[00:19:28] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: note the part where I said "I am all for readonly properties"
[00:19:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> That you want computed properties to be computed properties (and not instance-backed) seems like a banal insight
[00:19:41] <feep> one would hope it was banal :P
[00:19:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> It doesn't seem to live up to the way you described this before
[00:19:54] <feep> yeah we talked past each other for a bit
[00:20:34] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: anyway, I still hold that the method should always never have the form @set void legal(bool status);
[00:20:39] <feep> almost*
[00:20:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> It should never have a setter, at all, of any kind
[00:20:50] <feep> even better!
[00:20:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because it's obviously a computed property, the end
[00:21:09] <feep> cool, we're just agreeing, all is well~
[00:21:44] <feep> like, is this banal? this is banal. sadly, it is also neither obvious nor commonsense.
[00:21:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, like, the way ObjC approaches this is kind of ... from a different side of it than many other languages

[00:23:25] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: right, but .... setters as a concept still shouldn't exist imo
[00:23:27] <dbohdan> rmmh: Cool!
[00:23:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then you automatically get an instance variable and automatically get synthesized getter/setter methods
[00:23:46] <feep> well, not on objects anyway
[00:23:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Ok now see this I don't get
[00:23:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why shouldn't they exist
[00:24:05] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: like, in the pornsite example
[00:24:14] <rmmh> the double-axis heatmap may be contrived but you could imagine a y axis of keys pace 
[00:24:19] <feep> it shouldn't be that there's some validation process that calls the generated method legal = true; on person
[00:24:26] <feep> it should call something like, ssnAgeValidated()
[00:24:45] <feep> or emailValidatedTrustAge()
[00:24:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Computed properties shouldn't have setters, we are agreed on this
[00:24:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> I want to know why you think NO properties should have setters.
[00:25:06] <feep> because objects are the guts of a class.
[00:25:12] <feep> er
[00:25:16] <feep> .. properties*

[00:25:47] <feep> that's just weird.
[00:26:05] <feep> that's the sort of thing that makes you ask "are you sure you built that human right"
[00:26:48] <feep> the way for a class to observe an external change in state is with a method call
[00:26:51] <feep> that's what methods are for
[00:27:08] <feep> it shouldn't get the state change stealthily inserted into its innards.
[00:27:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Y...yes?
[00:27:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Setters are methods
[00:27:28] <feep> yes
[00:27:46] <feep> sorry, I'm not pointing at a technical difference but a semantic one
[00:27:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right, so ... if setters are methods ... and methods are for changing state ... then...?
[00:28:12] <feep> a setter method is a method that shares a name with an instance variable of the class and updates that variable
[00:28:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or it can do anything else you like
[00:28:31] <feep> right but that's weird tho, like operator overloading
[00:28:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nah
[00:28:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not weird at all
[00:28:43] <feep> idk.
[00:29:13] <feep> yeah sorry, a lot of this is synthesized based on my intuition about oop, and I can't necessarily put it into words well
[00:29:34] <feep> my brain outputs things like "the handles on the class shouldn't just be its state, you can get unlimited state change that way, it explodes the state transition space"
[00:29:37] <feep> and I have no idea if that's legible
[00:29:57] <feep> ohey, pointer comparison works
[00:31:26] <feep> hm, but it still segfaults compiling the unittests
[00:31:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Here's a very simple example
[00:32:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> -(void) setLoadCount:(NSUInteger)loadCount {
[00:32:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> 	_loadCount = loadCount;
[00:32:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> 	[[XGopherLocationManager sharedManager] setLocationsNeedSaving:YES]; }
[00:32:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a setter for a property
[00:32:17] <feep> what's the class?
[00:32:20] <feep> also what's loadCount?
[00:32:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> It sets an instance variable, then updates some state
[00:32:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> loadCount is the name of a property
[00:32:46] <feep> yes
[00:32:49] <feep> what's loadCount?
[00:32:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like what does it do?
[00:32:56] <feep> yes
[00:33:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a load ... count
[00:33:04] <feep> okay
[00:33:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> It counts loads.
[00:33:06] <feep> what's the class?
[00:33:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> XGopherLocation
[00:33:14] <feep> um
[00:33:17] <feep> what does the class model*
[00:33:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> A gopher location
[00:33:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> :p
[00:33:47] <feep> okay
[00:33:47] <feep> so for instance, I'd do something like ...
[00:33:47] <feep> like, loadCount is incremented for every page load, right?
[00:34:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> More or less yeah
[00:34:46] <feep> so XGopherLocation should instead have a method called loaded()
[00:34:55] <feep> or loadPage() or something
[00:35:03] <feep> that internally increments loadCount
[00:35:15] <feep> and now, looking at the class, you can tell that this method increments loadCount, and loadCount only ever goes up by one
[00:35:29] <feep> whereas, with the current design, looking at the class, absolutely anything can be happening with loadCount
[00:35:36] *** Joins: MrFantastik (~Thunderbi@cpe-69-204-101-67.buffalo.res.rr.com)
[00:35:40] <feep> someone might be setting it to the current value to set locationsNeedSaving as a side effect!
[00:35:43] <feep> you don't know!
[00:36:08] <feep> so the class is porous because a bit of class logic that should belong to a gopher page, ie. "it got loaded", lives outside it
[00:36:58] <feep> and looking at the class, you have no idea what the *semantic meaning* of loadCount is
[00:37:09] <feep> like, what the business process is that caused it to be called
[00:37:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> What
[00:37:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Come on
[00:37:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is the semantic meaning of loadCount? It's the load count
[00:37:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> What could be simpler
[00:37:31] <feep> right, that's POD.
[00:37:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> POD?
[00:37:38] <feep> that's "the object is just a bundle of data"
[00:37:44] <feep> Plain Old Data
[00:38:04] <feep> but like, loadCount *isn't* just the load count
[00:38:12] <feep> there's that setLocationsNeedSaving thing too
[00:38:25] <feep> it has effects beyond the trivial.
[00:38:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[00:38:30] <feep> so this class sort of sits between pod and oop.
[00:38:39] <feep> awkwardly.

[00:46:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> But what even is an object, if it can't be *this*.

[00:54:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: So, like, it would be easy to rewrite it to be as you said (the only way loadCount is ever set is by doing .loadCount++); my objection isn't like "this would be hard" but "this would be weird". Like let's say I take this line in XGopherNavigationController that says "location.loadCount++;" and change it to say "[location loaded];", right (and rewrote XGopherLocation for loadCount to be readonly and for loaded to be a
[00:54:04] <Obormot\Arcturus>  method that etc. etc.) ...

[03:40:22] * catern grimaces at plain style
[03:40:25] <feep> but like ... if you have to hype direct style, something has gone wrong in your codebase.
[03:40:32] <catern> haha
[03:41:56] <quanticle> Yeah... isn't direct-style programming just programming?
[03:42:04] <quanticle> Like, it's the default case
[03:43:23] <feep> something something western medicine
[03:44:13] <catern> i don't really want to explain it right now but IMO, direct style more generally is contrasted with declarative programming (which CPS is an example of), and declarative programming is a menace, hence why I want "direct-style" to be a good, friendly sounding term that I can market with

[03:47:10] <kuudes> nonweird science
[03:47:49] <saturn2> why is declarative programming a menace?
[03:53:13] <catern> it's a menace when it means writing in constrained languages without normal features like variables, functions, loops, because that makes them "declarative" and therefore good

[03:54:01] <catern> but it doesn't really have a definition
[03:54:35] <feep> harrrrrr
[03:54:45] <catern> I use "declarative programming" just to refer to any effort to make people program by just writing a big piece of data (e.g. configuration) instead of writing real programs, i.e. functions
[03:55:00] <saturn2> oh okay
[03:55:21] <saturn2> i have to disagree, all code should be data
[03:55:53] <catern> nah, all data should be code, code is more fundamental and easier to parse and reinterpret

[04:00:51] <catern> saturn2: just curious, very briefly, why do you say "all code should be data"? (there are many possible motivations, I just want to know which one is on your mind)
[04:01:45] <quanticle> Lisp
[04:01:56] <quanticle> Or rather, homoiconicity

[04:12:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> No

[05:27:10] <quanticle> And, honestly, for a house like that in California, 5.1 is basically the market rate

[16:27:30] <feepbot> Hey everyone, I just wanted to chime in and say that GPT-J is incredibly legit. ... | Hacker News
[16:28:50] <shawwwn> between winning a gaint blue gorilla at a carnival, and getting a few dozen people to sign up with tfrc, I'm just so happy I'll be leaving ML on a high note
[16:29:15] <PapuaHardyNet> are you sillysaurusx?
[16:29:19] <shawwwn> yis.
[16:29:22] <PapuaHardyNet> awesome
[16:29:30] <PapuaHardyNet> you'll be leaving ML?
[16:29:37] <PapuaHardyNet> that is not awesome
[16:30:27] <shawwwn> someone once told me, family is an endless source of strength. he was talking about having kids. I thought he was fooling himself
[16:30:34] <shawwwn> if he was fooling himself, then I'm a fool in the same way
[16:31:07] <shawwwn> my goal is to save up a fuckload of money so we can do IVF and start a family. I have no hesitation or regrets at taking a $200k/yr job building finance APIs
[16:31:49] <shawwwn> my first interview there is on monday. https://gist.github.com/shawwn/675d48f788e6fe193daa65553f803998
[16:32:00] <feepbot> routaapp.md · GitHub (GitHub Gist: instantly share code, notes, and snippets.)
[16:34:00] <shawwwn> I'm gonna walk in and tell them that $200k is a floor, not a ceiling. I can make finance SDKs my passion in life; the admission fee is a $200k salary. their key guy just left, and my wife was employee #5, so we'll get to be a "power couple" at work, ha.
[16:35:05] <shawwwn> I'm going into it with zero expectations. I fully expect to faceplant during the interview. but if I do, I'll be moving onto the next opportunity, and then the next, because family is a source of strength, and I'm gonna get my kid that parent with a $200k salary and a nice life.
[16:36:01] <kuudes> nice
[16:36:04] <PapuaHardyNet> hell yeah
[16:36:09] <shawwwn> but it'll be bittersweet. I'll miss the feeling of the world being a playground, open to whatever the hell gwern and I thought was funny to work on.

[16:39:15] <shawwwn> I'll be moonlighting with TPUs, but first and foremost I'll be at carnivals with emily https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1411519063432519680 and hanging out with my nieces and building sdks for routable. if I get the job.

[16:39:31] <shawwwn> and annoying ya'll, and fucking with obormot

[16:41:22] <PapuaHardyNet> let's see you get that finance API job then :)
[16:41:25] <shawwwn> but that's fine. like I told gwern, someday I might show up and pull ganbooru out of my hat, and go "lookie! you can type text and make whatever anime you want" -- 'cause ML was first and foremost my fun side hobby, and nothing more. that won't be changing. it'll just take more time to do big things.
[16:42:06] <shawwwn> IVF is so fucking expensive man
[16:42:24] <shawwwn> it literally makes sense to go fly to south korea and do it there, because it only costs like $8k instead of $40k
[16:42:42] <shawwwn> and the doctors were trained in america anyway
[16:43:18] <shawwwn> the only reason I haven't tried to get that job before now, is because it didn't occur to me that if I made it a priority, I could make a kid materialize faster. money is the sole bottleneck
[16:43:38] <PapuaHardyNet> it is a messed up world where money is the bottleneck to having a kid
[16:43:43] <shawwwn> so some kind of caveman portion of my brain activated a week or two ago, and from then till now I've been committed
[16:44:42] <PapuaHardyNet> now I hesitate to ask this, and feel free to ignore the question, of course
[16:45:11] <PapuaHardyNet> but have you thought of adoption? It is a common EA-adjacent opinion so I decided to ask

[17:08:42] <kuudes> would insemination be enough?
[17:20:23] <PapuaHardyNet> sidenote: I'm training a capsule network, and this is how I'm doing it: host (alpine linux) -> chroot (arch linux) -> python virtualenv -> guildai python virtualenv -> actual python code run
[17:21:14] <PapuaHardyNet> also, I fixed the accuracy issue I've been facing for over more than a week. The worst part is that my code was all correct: it was my accuracy calculation code that was incorrect
[17:41:20] <PapuaHardyNet> "Ben Wang. Remember that name; you’ll be seeing a lot of it in the coming decade. It’s clear to me that whichever lab he ends up at (he’s an undergrad! Google let him slip away because he didn’t have a degree!), he’s gonna be changing the world. Don’t know what, don’t know how, know he will."
[17:41:34] <PapuaHardyNet> well, that's quite impressive
[17:45:46] <catern> shawwwn: if you want a referral for the finance company I work for I can give you one, I can also suggest some other places to apply. I think you'd be a really good fit for the modeling engineering group at any trading firm, which are increasingly getting into ML stuff
[17:46:22] <catern> (and if you're interested in money, you can make a lot more than $200k)
[17:53:56] <RiversHaveWings> PapuaHardyNet: i didn't know he was an undergrad, wow
[17:54:13] <RiversHaveWings> he gave me a working microbatching scheme for training CLIP-like models
[17:55:45] <catern> (btw that referral offer goes for anyone... hmm I feel like the EleutherAI discord would be a good place to recruit for this...)
[17:56:58] <kuudes> what country is it in or requires the employee to be in?
[17:57:25] <catern> us or uk
[17:57:30] <kuudes> ah
[17:57:53] <kuudes> btw would it be useful to make #lw-pro again over this side? would people get use of it?
[17:58:28] <PapuaHardyNet> well, what is #lw-pro?
[17:58:41] <kuudes> we had it as career stuff
[17:58:51] <PapuaHardyNet> also sidenote for people interested in running GPT-J-6B on their workstations: you need a 3090
[17:59:06] <PapuaHardyNet> "Have a GPU with 16GB's to play comfortably, though others have slower methods." -- some guy on EleutherAI discord who seems to be an authority figure
[17:59:11] <kuudes> not to prevent people from discussing career stuff here on main, but to make it possible to also discuss stuff sort of more discreetly or similar
[17:59:44] <kuudes> also, I made a #lw-channeltest to sniff out if we have autojoiners
[18:00:01] <kuudes> hmm, maybe not. thanks!
[18:00:04] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I'm kinda new here, but I don't see the downside of discussing career related stuff here
[18:00:12] <kuudes> yes, that is indeed good as well
[18:00:25] <kuudes> but one may not want to say out loud when they are looking for a job etc
[18:00:48] <PapuaHardyNet> I... isn't #lesswrong basically a very niche and unknown channel?
[18:01:06] <kuudes> well... 144 users still even after the jump
[18:01:08] <kuudes> was 300+ before
[18:01:24] <kuudes> largest group I am in on internet :-p
[18:01:37] <PapuaHardyNet> hahahah, that's surprising
[18:02:01] <PapuaHardyNet> most people are parts of Discord groups with thousands of people (EleutherAI discord for example, and I know gwern participates there)
[18:02:16] <kuudes> ah no, lesswrong telegram has 159 accounts so it is now larger than this
[18:03:16] <kuudes> but yeah, you could be right in that it would fragment. we already had some fragmentation problem on freenode
[18:03:22] <PapuaHardyNet> anyway, I probably wouldn't idle on #lw-*. Let's see what other people say
[18:04:01] <kuudes> oh, indeed you are only on #lesswrong
[18:04:21] <kuudes> but it is true that mainly only #lw-politics and #lw-fandom have discussion
[18:05:13] <PapuaHardyNet> really? #lesswrong is less active in comparison to those two channels?
[18:05:42] <kuudes> not less active
[18:05:56] <kuudes> other #lw-* don't generally have discussion
[18:07:07] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, I see
[18:07:27] <PapuaHardyNet> #lw-politics is full of outrage porn, so I stopped idling there
[18:09:17] <kuudes> that may be wise
[18:17:03] <PapuaHardyNet> also, I'm not sure who recommended me firefox again, but I thank them
[18:17:45] <PapuaHardyNet> chromium on alpine linux kept signing me out of gmail just after I signed in, and using ublock origin on chromium made it refuse to work entirely.
[18:17:53] <PapuaHardyNet> firefox however *just worked*
[18:22:34] <shawwwn> > but have you thought of adoption? It is a common EA-adjacent opinion so I decided to ask
[18:22:34] <shawwwn> PapuaHardyNet: you can ask me anything at all! sorry, I got distracted with more TPU randomness.
[18:22:34] <shawwwn> we've never seriously considered it. but that's probably because I would hesitate. you don't have to go far to hear so many horror stories about adoption https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/e13gup/parents_who_adopted_a_child_and_then_regretted_it/

[18:24:11] <shawwwn> catern: you're sweet. thank you; if routable falls through, I might actually take you up on that.
[18:25:35] <shawwwn> > ah no, lesswrong telegram has 159 accounts so it is now larger than this
[18:25:35] <shawwwn> kuudes: there's a lesswrong telegram? that's kinda cool.
[18:30:22] <kuudes> yes
[18:30:40] <kuudes> it is mainly european lesswrongers but also some from other places
[18:30:45] <kuudes> do you want to join there?
[18:30:52] <shawwwn> PapuaHardyNet: btw, I find #lw-politics to be quite engaging. it's a funny atmosphere most of the time. you might like lurking there.
[18:31:12] <shawwwn> it's decently active. and #lw-fandom is sometimes hilarious too.
[18:31:42] <shawwwn> the rest of the #lw- channels seem dead besides #lw-bitcoin :) which I happen not to care about
[18:32:16] <shawwwn> kuudes: hmm.... uh, sure! a lesswrong alternate universe? sounds interesting
[18:32:21] <kuudes> always
[18:32:30] <shawwwn> maybe there will be someone named nrewg that everyone holds in high regard
[18:32:42] <kuudes> hmm, how do these things work on telegram? msg me your phone number I guess?
[18:32:58] <kuudes> hmm
[18:33:04] <kuudes> or can I get the join link
[18:33:08] <kuudes> I guess that could work
[18:34:12] <kuudes> I don't seem to find the invitation link
[18:34:26] <kuudes> pm me your phone number so I add you on gram and then invite you there?

[19:07:09] <catern> hm, new analogy I just thought up:: the cost of maintaining stable APIs in a distributed system leading one to prefer larger units with unstable internal APIs, is analogous to, the transaction costs in a marketplace that lead one to create firms

[19:07:56] <shawwwn> all you have to do is sit down and wait until december, and there's a good chance they're somehow gonna make you famous because they want to release their 50B model under the tensorfork banner
[19:08:56] <shawwwn> I have no idea why they decided to drop this gift in our laps, but I likely already ruined it by trying to "help" them with my motivational speeches. they're now focusing on "not spending 16 hours a day doing nothing but obst" and "looking objectively at their careers"
[19:08:59] <gwern> gee, forgive me for only reading the twitter where they'd been silent for like a week after chatting almost hourly for months and having no response to the leak discussion and maybe getting a little worried that I'm throwing away hundreds of dollars a month for absolutely nothing @_@
[19:09:10] <gwern> (it's only my single largest expense)
[19:09:11] <quanticle> catern: Or the forces that lead organisms to develop specialized organs.
[19:09:53] <catern> quanticle: oh? I haven't heard of that/don't know about that process 
[19:09:54] <shawwwn> oh don't worry, I forgave you long ago. I accept my friend for how he is. you can just be so goddamn lovable sometimes, when you don't just DM me like a human and go "yo so what's up? curious what everyone's up to"
[19:11:20] <shawwwn> knowing that you really don't give a crap about your precious $400 and that it's all just a big social show to wave around in everyone's faces, while meanwhile there are people who live or die on $400/mo. I don't even get it. but yes, I'll optimize your GCE usage and keep you informed of developments as I see them
[19:11:41] <shawwwn> they haven't been talking much to me either, btw. I'm as much in the dark as you.
[19:11:58] <shawwwn> 'cause they're heads down working way harder than you or I are capable of
[19:12:01] <gwern> catern: but it's not a one-way ratchet, ofcourse. systems don't just get larger monotonically. so you need to take that into account. it's an instance of /Backstop - 'inside' the module, you can use force and learned algorithms and heuristics for design, but that is unreliable; outside, you need evolution which is reliable but high variance
[19:12:36] <gwern> catern: so the question is what's the 'fitness' or 'market' which is operating outside the large-API which constrains andselects among them and keeps them honest?
[19:12:37] <catern> gwern: ah, nice elaboration of the analogy! yeah, that's interesting...
[19:12:56] <catern> the market for APIs...
[19:15:39] <quanticle> I think thinking of it in terms of evolutionary terms is more useful. What are the "fittest" APIs for a given module? How would you determine the "fitness" of a given API?
[19:19:27] <gwern> the problem here is more intra-API than inter-API. given a very specific specification, evolving the API is incremental local stuff. you may even be able to a/b test your way up the hill! but the real problem is deciding modules should exist at all
[19:20:44] <gwern> given a spec or domain, parts of an API can be optimized in isolation. but the set of APIs itself cannot be optimized in isolation. there is no view from nowhere
[19:21:12] <gwern> the overall set of APIs is interacting with each other, with the community, with the economics and businesses...
[19:22:48] <quanticle> >but the real problem is deciding modules should exist at all
[19:22:54] <catern> interesting observation; to translate that back into markets, I guess: you can drive down the transaction costs of interactions between two firms buying and selling a certain good, but the real impossible "planning problem" is deciding how the economy should be divided into firms
[19:22:59] <quanticle> Which is why I find the comparison with the evolution of organs to be so interesting
[19:23:27] <quanticle> Initially, all life was single-celled organisms. What kicked off that impetus for specialization?
[19:23:27] <kuudes> oh, happy independence day for americans!
[19:23:39] <catern> I feel like I've never heard a critique of central planning from that perspective, but I haven't really read any
[19:24:42] <quanticle> gwern: Related to your OPSEC tip; apparently there are quite a few malware packages that will exclude your computer if you have a Russian keyboard installed.
[19:27:12] <catern> (gwern, of course, is immediately throwing out these deep insights on an analogy that only just barely occurred to me)
[19:29:09] <quanticle> Well, that's the problem with gwern. He throws out deep insights on an analogy that might turn out to be totally wrong.
[19:33:23] <gwern> perhaps, but it certainly hasn't 'just occurred to me'. I've been talking about bilevel optimization as a pattern for many years now
[19:33:41] <gwern> and I am in good company, from darwin and coase on
[19:35:46] <catern> (to be clear, I was expressing awe, not criticizing)
[19:37:12] <gwern> (ie the most important decision anyone ever made about amazon's APIs was bezos deciding that there would *be* APIs)
[19:39:11] <catern> hm, I'm not sure I'd agree with that framing - there would still be APIs (in many different forms) without that Bezos declaration, they just would be much less stable - and thus much harder to sell to the outside world
[19:41:34] <quanticle> Yeah, I would reframe that as, "The most important decision that Bezos made was to make the APIs *explicit*"
[19:41:35] <catern> (does that mean that the Bezos declaration could really be rephrased as saying: "We shall have internal competition and separate firms like the outside world"?)
[19:42:30] <quanticle> Every system uses an API to communicate with other systems. However, usually that API is implicit. Set these values in the data store, and the next stage of the processing will pick them up.
[19:42:38] <gwern> yes, you can see it as that way. amazon is a shell around a lot of competing teams
[19:42:44] <gwern> in order to scale
[19:43:24] <quanticle> And, IMO, the interesting thing isn't that Bezos decided to have internal competition
[19:43:34] <quanticle> The interesting thing is that Bezos got internal competition to *work*
[19:43:43] <quanticle> Usually when firms do internal competition, it's a *disaster*
[19:43:51] <quanticle> Look at the entire history of DEC, for example
[19:44:07] <quanticle> Or General Motors in the '70s and the '80s.
[19:44:10] <quanticle> Or Sears
[19:44:41] <quanticle> And, to be fair, it *barely* works at Amazon
[19:44:48] <gwern> it being so software/internet heavy is probably a large part of why it works at amazon
[19:45:28] <gwern> the teams can internally use a lot of optimized tools like operations research or A/B testing to run themselves and optimize for their proxy metrics
[19:45:40] <quanticle> There is chronic underinvestment in infrastructure at Amazon, precisely because no one can claim credit for having good infrastructure. It's a commons that everyone relies upon and there is no credit for making it better, only blame for making it worse.
[19:46:05] <quanticle> Heck, just yesterday, large parts of Amazon's common deployment system were crippled.
[19:46:25] <gwern> oh, is that what was going on?
[19:46:29] <quanticle> Yep
[19:46:43] <quanticle> The internal deployment system, which also handles autoscaling collapsed.
[19:46:52] <catern> (I guess "We shall have internal competition and separate firms like the outside world" is an inaccurate way to put it actually. it's "We shall have *the effects of having* internal competition and separate firms like the outside world". normally competition gives an incentive to drop inter-firm transaction costs/stabilize your APIs. but that incentive doesn't exist inside Amazon so Bezos made an artificial one...)
[19:46:59] <gwern> how does a deployment system breaking break my cart, I have to wonder... autoscaling? so like, there were literally no servers to handle my cart
[19:47:24] <quanticle> I'm not privy to the details (obviously).
[19:47:56] <quanticle> But yeah, it was a big deal and people were scrambling to fix
[20:05:40] <catern> (hm so the followup question here is whether, inside Amazon, if some group makes an insufficiently stable API with too-high transaction costs, another group can make their own API and encourage customers to use that instead and reap the benefits)
[20:07:03] <gwern> ('bit creep' towards making the stabler or cheaper API doing more and more, even if unsuited...)
