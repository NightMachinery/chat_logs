[02:44:58] <Belamos> hi
[02:45:27] <Belamos> I want to work with a proxy clip in a video editing program.
[02:45:41] <Belamos> So, the idea is to work on a low-resolution clip  to make it work on my old computer
[02:45:55] <Belamos> just before rendering, I would then replace the low-res clip with a high-res clip
[02:46:04] <Belamos> here is what I did:
[02:46:18] <Belamos> ffmpeg -i 4K_footage.mp4 -vf "scale=480:320" low_res.mp4
[02:46:26] <Belamos> this worked like a charm!
[02:47:01] <Belamos> but, something seems to go wrong with ffmpeg there
[02:47:16] <Belamos> because when I want to replace the clip in my video editing program, I get this error message:
[02:47:24] <Belamos> Quote:
[02:47:26] <Belamos> >> You are replacing a clip with a shorter one, this might cause issues in timeline.
[02:47:26] <Belamos> Replacement is 1 frames shorter.
[02:47:44] <Belamos> ^ why is the replacement 1 frame shorter?   Did ffmpeg drop 1 frame?

[15:39:27] <JEEB> pretty sure they are escape'able, just make sure your shell or something isn't causing trouble
[15:39:48] <JEEB> I would recommend testing it with a scripting language which lets you set an array of strings as arguments (like python etc)
[15:40:00] <JEEB> that way you know exactly how the strings passed onto argv look like

[15:59:52] <Uks2> Thanks for the help, I couldn't get the arguments parsed correctly even with python, I think because it's ffmpeg parsing within the argument, not a shell problem.  But it turns out that python has an FFmpeg library that will do the job just fine.

[16:01:47] <JEEB> yea it does have parsing of the filter chain as well, it just takes one layer out of it :)
[16:04:39] <JEEB> I have some double-quoted string here in python and it has a hilarious amount of backslashes before a : :)  (but that is probably since it is within the text thing with a %{} for drawtext
[16:14:09] <Uks2> Wait!  I've figured it out.  It turns out 4 backslashes is the magic number (in a shell script, in double quotes, at least) and I'd only tried up to two.

[17:37:07] <lmat> What I'm wanting to achieve is to crop to a different area of the video. I tried this:
[17:37:22] <lmat> ffmpeg -i VID_20210126_205054.mp4 -r 15 -f v4l2 -f:v "crop=640:480:15:15" -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb24 /dev/video7;
[17:37:43] <lmat> but I get "Requested output format 'crop=...' is not a suitable output format."
[17:38:20] <lmat> I also tried   -f:v "v4l2;crop=640..."  , then I get "At least one output file must be specified", so something must be wrong with that syntax, too.

[17:40:04] <durandal_1707> order of options is important
[17:40:30] <lmat> in `man ffmpeg;` it says "Simple filtergraphs are configured with per-stream -filter option...A simple filtergraph for video can look for example like this:" and shows almost exactly what I want.

[19:44:38] <BtbN> You are aware that depending on how strongly it's already compressed, you will trash the quality in the process?
[19:45:16] <DHE> is this a case of "my hard drive is filled because my uncompressed/raw video files are so enormous" ?
[19:46:11] <furq> i admire your optimism
[19:47:10] <DHE> I require clarification to the problem. if your hard drives are filled, "how do I do transcodes?" seems like the wrong question to be asking
[19:47:35] <furq> when has that ever stopped anyone
[19:47:38] <linext__> there's a script for my DVR that deletes the oldest video first
[19:47:56] <linext__> rather than deleting it, i'm thinking of recompressing it to half the original size

I mean, not like there's any other use for the bandwidth on the frequency... then again even the HD around here is MPEG2... going up 2 generations of video codecs from an acceptable source should be fairly good?

[21:07:01] <kepstin> vp9 encoder's kind of annoying to use tho.
[21:07:02] <boris[m]> ok so `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M output.webm` ?
[21:07:26] <kepstin> use 2-pass mode.

[21:08:25] <kepstin> need to run the command twice, once with "-pass 1", and again with "-pass 2"
[21:08:41] <boris[m]> oh! what is this for ?
[21:08:45] <kepstin> you can use a faster option to the "-speed" parameter to libvpx when doing the first pass normally.
[21:09:04] <boris[m]> also would vp8 be easier maybe ?
[21:09:25] <kepstin> vp8 is faster to encode than vp9... but at that point you should use h264 (libx264 encoder) instead.
[21:10:20] <kepstin> libx264 is super simple to use, just set the "-preset" option based on how long you feel like waiting and the "-crf" option based on how good you want the output to look

[21:14:56] <kepstin> The default for -crf with libx264 is "22" nowadays, i think, which is "pretty decent but not great" quality. I recommend test encoding a short sample to verify the quality, and adjust the number a bit smaller for higher quality, or a bit bigger for lower file size.

[22:54:30] <emcodem> good evening ladies and gentlemen
[22:55:53] <emcodem> just a short query... i wonder which IRC client is mostly used here that keeps up the connection forever maybe. Currently i use irccloud but i'd like to avoid paying for the service

[23:01:32] <JEEB> emcodem: irccloud is definitely one of the most user-friendly things, so in that sense it saves you from having to set up things yourself (and also IIRC has synchronized web|mobile clients). for eternal connections run from a VPS or server there's: quassel (has mobile and GUI clients connecting to the server component), weechat (run in tmux, fire and forget. mobile etc through ssh+tmux), irssi (same thing as
[23:01:38] <JEEB> weechat, terminal IRC client which you can run in tmux and attach to it when needed)

[23:11:38] <emcodem> @JEEB thanks, might i ask what you use personally? You got a subscription for irccloud?
[23:14:54] <furq> i use irssi on a vps but obviously i pay for the vps
[23:15:02] <furq> although it's cheaper than an irccloud subscription and i get an entire vps

[23:17:17] <emcodem> @furq thanks thats really heplpful. I Got a number of servers where i can run stuff 24/7 so that's not the problem.
[23:18:22] <emcodem> Sure i ask for my personal entertainment in first place but actually i wondered if i was able to capture the messages and make a backlog available for public somewhere...
[23:18:43] <emcodem> Would it be a bad idea to do so?
[23:18:55] <furq> probably better to run a bot if you just want logs
[23:19:09] <furq> there used to be publicly available logs but whoever was providing them stopped about 18 months ago
[23:19:26] <furq> if you mean for this channel then you should probably ask the ops before making them public
[23:19:34] <emcodem> makes sense
[23:19:52] <furq> or for any channel where you don't have ops i guess

[23:20:34] <emcodem> of course... well maybe it is not wanted to have a public backlog of this chat anyways
[23:20:56] <emcodem> running a bot would mean to be a channel operator, right?
[23:21:01] <furq> no
[23:21:31] <furq> there was a mailing list on ffmpeg.org with irc logs for ~10 years
[23:21:36] <furq> or there still is but the guy posting the logs stopped
[23:21:47] <furq> https://lists.ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel-irc/
[23:22:11] <emcodem> yeah i'm aware of this.. thats why i thought about bringing it up again
[23:22:38] <furq> i have no idea why it stopped but i don't think anyone objected to it
[23:22:48] <emcodem> me neither
[23:22:51] <furq> anyone in here could be logging and making it public really
[23:22:58] <murb> given the current climate you'd probably need to get everyone to *opt in*
[23:22:59] <emcodem> yup
[23:23:13] <furq> it's a public irc channel, there's no expectation of privacy
[23:23:47] <murb> furq: there may not be an expectation that someone can find this comment in some internet search 10 years hense either.
[23:23:52] <emcodem> yeah ok, so let me see if i can get this running for my personal entertainment and after that i check my options hehe
[23:24:26] <furq> murb: well there should be
[23:24:39] <emcodem> hehe +1 for @furq
[23:24:42] <murb> there isn't and the infra is hosted in the european union, so gdpr applies.
[23:25:38] <furq> i don't think it does
[23:25:44] <furq> unless the network itself is making logs available
[23:27:45] <emcodem> @murb my concern with paying irccloud for saving my chat history actually hits kind of this green IT topic... i'm not sure if they don't save the history for each and every user separate. At least their payment model looks like it.

[23:29:48] <emcodem> no need to mention that i'd pay 40 USD per year just to save the ffmpeg chat history only as i don't have interest in any other IRC chats
