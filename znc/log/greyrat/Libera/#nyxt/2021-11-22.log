[04:06:46] <mariari> waleee: I often get this kind of crash, someone posts a link on irc, and nyxt memory faults
[04:07:06] <mariari> very common theme, just odd given that all the action does after not touching nyxt is spawn a new buffer and it dies
[04:08:12] <waleee> are you using a web-based irc-client inside nyxt? Otherwise that sounds extremly weird
[04:08:28] <mariari> no
[04:08:37] <mariari> I use weechat
[04:08:40] <mariari> I open a link someone sends
[04:08:42] <mariari> often nyxt crashes
[04:08:47] <mariari> this is a trend I see
[04:08:51] <mariari> I don't touch it for a while I go back
[04:08:53] <mariari> it dies rather quick
[04:08:58] <mariari> then I restart it
[04:09:10] <waleee> mariari: ah, you open the posted link in nyxt?
[04:09:20] <mariari> I open it by sending it to nyxt
[04:09:26] <mariari> I.e. terminal sends it to nyxt when I hit enter
[04:09:37] <mariari> typically it's an image
[04:09:40] <mariari> so a .jpg file
[04:09:45] <mariari> or these days I can watch webms on it
[04:10:15] <waleee> this is set up via  a swank/slynk connection?
[04:10:20] <mariari> no
[04:10:24] <mariari> though I can open one up
[04:10:26] <mariari> just from a terminal
[04:10:35] <mariari>  LANG=en_US.UTF-8 nyxt
[04:10:38] <mariari> in particular from a terminal
[04:10:51] <waleee> ok a fresh instance with the url
[04:10:59] <mariari> well
[04:11:01] <mariari> no
[04:11:04] <mariari> it's an already opened instance
[04:11:10] <mariari> the " LANG=en_US.UTF-8 nyxt" stays open until it crashes
[04:11:14] <mariari> with the ingestion of a termianl calling
[04:11:16] <mariari> nyxt url
[04:11:21] <mariari> sending the url to the browser
[04:11:33] <mariari> it's during the creation of the new buffer when it dies(?)
[04:12:40] <waleee> do you have epiphany installed? Could you check how it behaves if you substitue nyxt with epiphany in your weechat config
[04:12:58] <mariari> what is ephiphany?
[04:13:22] <waleee> the gnome projects webkit2gtk browser
[04:13:33] <mariari> I don't think it would crash
[04:13:37] <mariari> but I can see if it's as unstable
[04:13:52] <mariari> the thing is
[04:13:57] <mariari> during normal use of nyxt it crashes as well
[04:14:04] <mariari> this is just an interseting place as
[04:14:11] <mariari> I haven't touched the browser in a while
[04:14:16] <mariari> open a link to likely quickly kill it
[04:14:20] <mariari> but it crashes upon creating hte buffer
[04:14:40] <waleee> any backtrace from those instances?
[04:14:44] <mariari> lol no
[04:14:45] <mariari> I never get those
[04:14:56] <mariari> CORRUPTION WARNING in SBCL pid 558105 tid 558124:
[04:14:58] <mariari> Memory fault at 0xa6ffffffe0 (pc=0x7f0ddb3ab547, fp=0xa6ffffffff, sp=0x7f0dc681c1b8) tid 558124
[04:15:00] <waleee> hm, so it crashes in webkit-land then
[04:15:00] <mariari> The integrity of this image is possibly compromised.
[04:15:02] <mariari> Continuing with fingers crossed.
[04:15:04] <mariari> <WARN> [18:36:06] Warning: Error on GTK thread: Unhandled memory fault at #xA6FFFFFFE0.
[04:15:06] <mariari> this is what I always get every time
[04:15:08] <mariari> yes
[04:15:12] <mariari> it does this I'd argue probably a dozen times of day maybe
[04:15:20] <mariari> though it depends sometimes it's fine for a bit
[04:15:24] <mariari> but it's a very fragile beast
[04:16:03] <waleee> what version of webkit2gtk are on your system?
[04:16:17] <mariari> let me check
[04:16:29] <mariari> 1 extra/webkit2gtk 2.34.1-2 (23.2 MiB 95.8 MiB) (Installed)
[04:16:37] <mariari> have this one as well
[04:16:38] <mariari> 2 extra/webkit2gtk-4.1 2.34.1-2 (23.5 MiB 103.9 MiB) (Installed)y
[04:16:45] <mariari> but not 5.0
[04:17:02] <mariari> oh
[04:17:05] <mariari> 4.1 is from ephinany
[04:17:11] <mariari> that you asked me to grab so that is brand new
[04:17:33] <waleee> the 5.0 should be a "fail to build" since it uses gtk4
[04:18:02] <waleee> mariari: oh, was it a older version before the epiphany install?
[04:18:10] <mariari> it was
[04:18:13] <mariari> 1 extra/webkit2gtk 2.34.1-2 (23.2 MiB 95.8 MiB) (Installed)
[04:18:15] <mariari> this one
[04:18:23] <mariari> https://pomf2.lain.la/f/mdajo8.png
[04:18:25] <mariari> 2 is new
[04:18:49] <mariari> do you think that could solve the problem
[04:18:55] <mariari> as nyxt has always been very unstable for me
[04:19:07] <mariari> again it's quite jarring to open an URL
[04:19:11] <mariari> entire browser dies
[04:19:38] <waleee> the 2nd one seems like it just uses the libwebkit2gtk.so versioning
[04:19:53] <waleee> but weird that it was two different packages in the same repo
[04:20:06] <mariari> yeah not sure what arch is doing, I assume both should be fine?
[04:20:13] <mariari> note my laptop when I'm not at home has similar crashes
[04:20:22] <mariari> when I use it as a secondary computer it crashes a lot less often
[04:21:39] <waleee> hm I wonder if that webkit2gtk version was the one that had some fun issues or if all was fixed with any 2.34.1
[04:22:05] <mariari> what do you mean they are all 2.34.1?
[04:23:14] <waleee> they bump the trailing digit (2.34.1-1 <--) for tweaks
[04:23:43] <mariari> I see
[04:23:47] <mariari> but they are the same digit -2
[04:24:12] <waleee> mariari: funky, the webkit2gtk package uses libwebkit2gtk-4.0
[04:24:48] <mariari> the base webkit2gtk the one with no extra versioning ala 5.0 and 4.1?
[04:25:00] <waleee> the base
[04:25:49] <waleee> if you would rebuild now I think the 4.1 would be used
[04:25:54] <waleee> * rebuild nyxt
[04:26:16] <mariari> do you think that might make it more stable?
[04:26:35] <mariari> would be intersting to test, and if so then less peole will get a very buggy nyxt
[04:27:04] <waleee> the guix-pack version uses it already afaik
[04:27:12] <mariari> yeah hmm wait a second
[04:27:24] <mariari> the 4.1 package has
[04:27:25] <mariari> libwebkit2gtk-4.1.so=0-64
[04:27:27] <mariari> instead of
[04:27:31] <mariari>  libwebkit2gtk-4.0.so=37-64
[04:27:37] <mariari> which is what the non 4.1 has
[04:27:49] <mariari> and 5.0 uses
[04:27:50] <mariari>  libwebkit2gtk-5.0.so=0-64
[04:28:12] <waleee> yeah that one should be avoided
[04:28:25] <mariari> well I guess I'll pull remove the non 4.1 and rebuild
[04:28:27] <mariari> and see if that helps?
[04:28:41] <mariari> seems I can't uninstall the non 4.1
[04:34:43] <waleee> I remember a "#+ ... 4.1" somewhere but couldn't find it atm, but I think the highest version of libwebkit2gtk-4.x will be used
[04:34:53] <mariari> that would be good if so
[04:34:58] <mariari> do you think that might make it more stable?
[04:35:08] <mariari> I'm skeptical just because this has been an ongoing issue for quite some time
[04:35:21] <waleee> not sure
[04:40:32] <mariari> what I'll do is open links via epiphany along side nyxt and records if it ever crashes. For now
[04:45:25] <mariari> waleee: good news!
[04:45:30] <mariari> epiphany crashed!
[04:45:38] <mariari> though it seems from the bookmark manager
[04:45:49] <mariari> as I was trying to find a way to kill pages without having to click
[04:46:01] <mariari> epiphany:ERROR:../epiphany/src/bookmarks/ephy-bookmarks-manager.c:400:ephy_bookmarks_manager_remove_bookmark_internal: assertion failed: (!g_sequence_iter_is_end (iter))
[04:46:03] <mariari> Bail out! epiphany:ERROR:../epiphany/src/bookmarks/ephy-bookmarks-manager.c:400:ephy_bookmarks_manager_remove_bookmark_internal: assertion failed: (!g_sequence_iter_is_end (iter))
[04:46:07] <mariari> seems like a good sign?
[04:47:04] <waleee> maybe, if it crashes on the equivalent action in nyxt you at least should have a possible webkit trace
[04:47:50] <mariari> side annoyance urxvt is  opening up on epiphany for some reason now
[04:47:54] <mariari> how annoying
[04:49:10] <mariari> you know what pressing yes on a prompt that I couldn't read too well
[04:49:15] <mariari> must have screwed up my mime files
[04:49:24] <mariari> side note I really hate mime files
[04:49:46] <waleee> .local/share/mimeapps.list or the equivalent .config path
[04:50:09] <mariari> yeah, doing a local replace now
[04:50:13] <mariari> just annoying how it configures
[04:50:20] <mariari> I've found even gui applications don't work the best
[04:50:22] <waleee> mariari: yeah, it's extremly annoying, firefox is a repeat offender when it's updated on my system
[04:50:31] <mariari> ahh is that why that happens?
[04:50:43] <mariari> I've had firefox do that quite a bit as well
[04:51:23] <waleee> it has a tendency to f*ck with the mimeapps and list itself for a ton of filetypes it doesn't have a business with
[04:52:32] <waleee> but it's not on every ff update, just the odd one

[19:37:24] <waleee> chat1: what do you have in mind?
[19:38:16] <chat1> thank you. I just want to give my observations on my user experience so far on the newest version.
[19:38:16] <waleee> (or the discourse forum, discourse.atlas.engineer)
[19:38:53] <waleee> chat1: then I think the discourse is best, if it isn't a bug or crash but general UX

[22:54:30] <iarebatman> hey there everyone.
[22:55:05] <jmercouris> Hello Batman
[22:56:22] <iarebatman> Question.. I've been wanting emacs to have a good built-in browser for a while now.. and just discovered nyxt.. so I'm wondering how much of emacs I can replace with it instead of the other way around... if that makes sense..
[22:56:38] <iarebatman> can nyxt be my editor as well, or is it strictly a browser?
[23:30:28] <edgarvincent[m]> jmercouris: I feel pain in my ribs because of you ^^
[23:31:21] <edgarvincent[m]> iarebatman: Nyxt has very basic editing abilities for the moment. Improving them drastically seems to be one of its wonderful aims :)
[23:31:57] <iarebatman> So don't expect org-mode is what you're saying? ;)
[23:33:32] <edgarvincent[m]> See plaintext-editor-mode. John also integrated ace-editor at some point, but I don't know if it still works.
[23:34:43] <edgarvincent[m]> iarebatman: Org-mode integration in Nyxt is one of the many things which keep me awake at night :) Unfortunately, it is not to be expected at this point.
[23:35:18] <iarebatman> well, if it's a direction they're headed - I'm excited
[23:35:40] <iarebatman> might need to rename it from `Nyxt browser` though at some point ;)
[23:36:20] <edgarvincent[m]> Nyxt will replace Emacs eventually. But don't tell anyone :)

[23:37:59] <iarebatman> very excited to see that.. is `Nyxt OS` on the roadmap yet, or is that only after emacs domination ?
[23:38:09] <edgarvincent[m]> (Please note that I am not one of the Nyxt devs - you might want to wait for confirmation of what I said, but unless I'm completely misguided, I think that's the way Nyxt is heading)
[23:39:08] <edgarvincent[m]> Probably only after that. There has been a lot of talk about Mezzano :)
[23:39:54] <iarebatman> yeah - I saw that they recently got Mezzano to boot on real hardware
[23:40:11] <edgarvincent[m]> (world domination might take another thirty years, but I trust the team fully to achieve it)
[23:41:12] <edgarvincent[m]> Jokes asides, Nyxt's development is very fast-paced and, as you have noticed, very influenced by Emacs, so you'll definitely feel at home.
[23:43:05] <iarebatman> that's good to hear.. thanks for socializing with me for a bit lol
[23:58:35] <edgarvincent[m]> My pleasure.
