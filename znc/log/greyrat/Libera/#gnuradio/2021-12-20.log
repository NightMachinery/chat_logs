[02:56:11] <muaddib[m]> In the QT GUI digital number control widget example in GNURadio 3.9, the 'value out' port appears to emit it's previously stored value when either a new input message arrives or if a variable is used in the 'value' field and it's changed from another source (i.e. range widget).
[02:56:11] <muaddib[m]> So if you start with 90e6 as the initial value of 'freq'  for both the message edit box and the number control, then change the value of 'freq' in the message edit box to 95e6, the number control display will change to 95,000,000 but the message from the 'value out' port will be 90e6. If you change the edit box again, now 95e6 will be emitted from the 'value out' port. 
[02:56:11] <muaddib[m]> Is this the expected behavior? 
[03:13:38] <willcode4[m]> That sounds like something I though was fixed a long time ago.
[03:26:12] <willcode4[m]> muaddib: The update is broken when responding to a message. `self.cur_freq` is not getting updated in this path before it is used to generate the outgoing message. It was something else that got fixed a while ago. You want to submit an Issue?
[03:52:37] <muaddib[m]> yea sure thing
[03:52:54] <muaddib[m]> should i do it under main or maint-3.9?

[11:42:55] <muaddib[m]> flash[m]: no way, that's crazy
[11:44:12] <flash[m]> it makes sense. Most browsers do a decent job with YAML. The problem is the intersection between markdown and YAML in your Matrix client.
[11:45:12] <flash[m]> The `#` character is the MD heading tag, so comments in YAML show up as big bold text.

[12:02:11] <zenchen90[m]> Hi all
[12:02:48] <zenchen90[m]> I am an engineer doing SDR projects that requires to use UDP sinks
[12:03:30] <zenchen90[m]> are there anyone who is familiar with what kind of hardware setups are required for UDP Sinks?
[12:04:33] <zenchen90[m]> eg server to external server or server to Virtual Machines etc
[12:05:32] <zenchen90[m]> I am not exactly sure of how to use UDP Sink
[12:06:22] <drmpeg> It's just a network connection.
[12:07:13] <zenchen90[m]> does the other node needs to have GNU Radio installed?
[12:07:31] <drmpeg> No.
[12:08:06] <zenchen90[m]> ok 
[12:08:29] <zenchen90[m]> how will the other node receive data from the server?
[12:08:58] <zenchen90[m]> *master
[12:09:05] <drmpeg> You'll need some sort of program to read the stream.
[12:09:16] <zenchen90[m]> ok
[12:10:23] <zenchen90[m]> it has to be a stream not vector right?
[12:11:25] <zenchen90[m]> any Idea how do I code it in Python/ C
[12:11:45] <zenchen90[m]> to read complex data
[12:13:31] <drmpeg> It's usually done with boost::asio
[12:13:52] <zenchen90[m]> is it a software?
[12:14:13] <drmpeg> It's a C++ library.
[12:14:33] <zenchen90[m]> alright I just yahooed it
[12:15:41] <zenchen90[m]> Thanks very much
[12:16:48] <drmpeg> Here's what I use for transmitting UDP packets. It just shows how easy it is with boost::asio. https://www.w6rz.net/udptx.cc
[12:17:45] <zenchen90[m]> gosh 
[12:18:08] <zenchen90[m]> is there a python version that you are familiar with?
[12:18:27] <drmpeg> Sorry, I don't do Python.
[12:18:45] <zenchen90[m]> haha I am much comfortable with it 
[12:18:59] <zenchen90[m]> Ouh
[12:19:12] <zenchen90[m]> alright 
[12:19:51] <zenchen90[m]> I guess I'll figure out how to use C then 
[12:20:11] <zenchen90[m]> Thanks a lot 
[12:20:32] <zenchen90[m]> btw which OS you performed it on?
[12:20:49] <drmpeg> Linux.
[12:21:41] <zenchen90[m]> cool because I am testing on Win 10 but I have to deploy it on Ubuntu
[12:21:51] <drmpeg> I'm sure there are Python examples on the Internet.
[12:22:06] <zenchen90[m]> sure I saw some 
[12:22:24] <zenchen90[m]> thanks 
[12:22:44] <drmpeg> The only reason I mention boost::asio is because that's how the GNU Radio blocks are implemented.
[12:23:09] <zenchen90[m]> makes sense
[12:23:37] <zenchen90[m]> meaning each block is connected via boost.asio?

[12:30:51] <zenchen90[m]> sudo apt-get install build-essential 
[12:31:46] <drmpeg> Yeah, when you first install Linux, it doesn't come with a C compiler.
[12:32:27] <zenchen90[m]> this aside , I am also trying to install gnuradio on raspbian OS 
[12:32:32] <drmpeg> So on Debian systems like Ubuntu, one of the first things to do is install.
[12:33:01] <zenchen90[m]> also linux based 
[12:33:12] <zenchen90[m]> noted 
[12:34:05] <drmpeg> I think you can just do "sudo apt-get install gnuradio" on raspian.
[12:34:18] <drmpeg> But you get an older version.
[12:34:19] <flash[m]> zenchen90: have you done any network programming before?
[12:34:31] <drmpeg> A little.
[12:35:13] <zenchen90[m]> flash: Im an amateur 
[12:35:29] <zenchen90[m]> its been years since I last done it 
[12:36:07] <flash[m]> I would recommend tackling one concept at a time. If you want to receive the UDP data in a Python program, then learn how to send/receive UDP. The `socket` package is your friend.
[12:36:50] <flash[m]> The UDP sink will provide you UDP packets. You can read them as you like, but don't add the complexity of gnuradio until you are comfortable with the networking
[12:36:59] <zenchen90[m]> ah network programming ! nope I have never done it before
[12:37:58] <zenchen90[m]> alright 
[12:38:19] <zenchen90[m]> thanks a lot guys 
[12:38:32] <flash[m]> If you search for "python UDP client/server" you should find some helpful tutorials
[12:38:42] <flash[m]> (assuming you want to stay in python)
[12:38:57] <zenchen90[m]> I would love to.
[12:40:16] <flash[m]> Python is great for whipping up quick hacks, including network coding. But you do need to have a good grasp of the basics
[12:40:35] <zenchen90[m]> see yall in a while  flash  drmpeg 
[12:41:07] <flash[m]> also, in Python, look at the `struct` package for turning the binary data into python numbers

[13:03:09] <linge93[m]> Okay, then suppose I set the carrier frequency of both channels to the same frequency (2.4GHz), and use another device for reception. Will these two channels suffer huge interference? (I think it will)
[13:04:15] <drmpeg> It's usually used for some sort of MIMO application where each channel is coded differently.

[13:12:01] <drmpeg> In gr-dtv, there's an example MISO flow graph for DVB-T2. vv018-miso.grc
[13:13:16] <drmpeg> It uses Alamouti coding. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space%E2%80%93time_block_code
[13:14:37] <drmpeg> MISO is 2 TX antennas and 1 RX antenna.
[13:15:06] <drmpeg> Typically a cross polarized antenna.
[13:15:43] <drmpeg> On RX, the two polarizations are just combined.
[13:16:13] <linge93[m]> Okay, thank you very much. In fact, I designed two communication systems, one is the pseudo-analog modulation of joint channel source coding, the other is the traditional digital modulation method, but I want to design a GUI to compare the performance of the two systems ( Used for on-site display, not in the paper), but if I transmit images through the two systems separately, I will inevitably turn on and off the GRC intermittently, which
[13:16:13] <linge93[m]> looks stupid
[13:23:00] <drmpeg> Sounds like you need two USRPs.
[13:23:47] <Yamakaja[m]> linge93: What's the bandwidth of your system? Could you fit both next to each other on a single signal?
[13:25:51] <linge93[m]> The bandwidth is set to 210kHz, the second question I did not understand what you mean

[13:30:08] <drmpeg> If you have a flow graph for each system, you could combine them into one flow graph. Then add the two signals together (but with one offset in frequency).

[14:03:27] <linge93[m]> <drmpeg> "If you have a flow graph for..." <- Yes, my original idea is the same, but if the frequency is different, for example, one is 2.4G and the other is 5.4G, then 2.4G's diffraction ability will be relatively stronger, so when comparing, others may say the experimental conditions Different, there may be errors, but this can be used as an alternative, thank you for your suggestions

[14:05:19] <Yamakaja[m]> linge93: But if your bandwidth is only 200 kHz or so, you can just run them with a frequency offset of 1MHz (Or more). B210s can go to 50 MHz+ of bandwidth, and that way your two systems should not interfere with each other

Will this not interfere with each other? Maybe I got it wrong.What is the frequency offset you are talking about here? (Whether the bandwidth is different? Is the value of ‘sps’ set in the USRP sink?)

[14:31:57] <Hoernchen> 1) the b210 channels are not really independently tunable, at most within the same chuink of bw 2) you're supposed to just put both signals next to each other, instead of on top of each other, within a larger bw
[14:36:47] <drmpeg> Here's a simple flow graph showing the concept. https://www.w6rz.net/offsettest.grc

[14:59:10] <drmpeg> All the vv???.grc and germany??.grc examples are DVB-T2.
[15:00:32] <BarryDuggan[m]> thanks! I hadn't tried them yet
[15:01:57] <drmpeg> "vv" stands for Verification and Validation.
[15:02:23] <BarryDuggan[m]> bingo! germany-g1 has one 🙂
[15:03:32] <drmpeg> The output of the flow graphs can be verified with these files. https://dvb.org/specifications/verification-validation/dvb-t2-reference-streams/
[15:06:18] <BarryDuggan[m]> thank you. this is a new area for me.
[15:06:57] <drmpeg> The germany flow graphs are just profiles that are being used for DVB-T2 in Germany.
[15:10:39] <drmpeg> gr-dtv is a little different than the rest of GNU Radio. Instead of general purpose blocks, it's all special blocks that only work for the specific DTV standards.
[15:18:03] <drmpeg> It's certainly not a popular component. Many folks disable it on their source builds.
[15:19:42] <drmpeg> But it fits the GNU Radio flow graph paradigm perfectly. A continuous stream of samples.
[15:20:11] <BarryDuggan[m]> what is the standard in the US?
[15:20:19] <drmpeg> ATSC.
[15:20:46] <BarryDuggan[m]> ah, that sounds familiar
[15:22:11] <drmpeg> There's a new standard called ATSC 3.0, but it's still being deployed.
[15:26:46] <drmpeg> Just a few cities. Only Mobile in Alabama.
[15:28:28] <drmpeg> There's no FCC mandate, so stations are not required to upgrade.

[15:29:49] <drmpeg> No. You need a new receiver and there aren't many of those.
[15:30:04] <linge93[m]> <drmpeg> "Here's a simple flow graph..." <- I understand this. I use the OFDM system, which is changed through gr-digital/examples/ofdm_tx.grc. It’s not like the “signal source” where I can set the “Frequency” to make the two signals With obvious frequency deviation, sub-carriers and so on can be set in this ofdm system, but how is the sub-carrier spacing determined? Is this related to "samp rate"? In my understanding, rate and
[15:30:04] <linge93[m]> bandwidth can be converted into each other. The faster the rate, the greater the bandwidth.
[15:30:41] <BarryDuggan[m]> that would definitely discourage deployment
[15:30:53] <BarryDuggan[m]> drmpeg
[15:31:35] <drmpeg> linge93[m] You can use it with OFDM. Think of the signal source as a local oscillator and the multiply block as a mixer.
[15:32:16] <drmpeg> Yeah, ATSC 3.0 is taking forever. COVID-19 did not help either.
[15:32:53] <drmpeg> We only have one station here in Silicon Valley.
[15:33:54] <linge93[m]> I get it, thanks
[15:35:41] <drmpeg> Here's a list of ATSC 3.0 stations. https://www.rabbitears.info/market.php?request=atsc3
[15:37:09] <drmpeg> Most of them are "lighthouse" stations. All the major channels in a market are jammed onto one or two ATSC 3.0 transmitters.
[15:43:22] <drmpeg> And the other use is channel 6 stations that broadcast FM on 87.75 MHz. It's a loophole that the FCC has allowed.
[15:45:07] <drmpeg> The station transmits both a reduced bandwidth OFDM signal and a regular analog FM signal together.
