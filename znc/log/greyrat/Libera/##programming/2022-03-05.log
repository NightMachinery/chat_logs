[07:10:13] <Jong> He says it's "rude" to have a function that takes many variables. He says instead objects should be made and then you pass a few objects. I consider stuffing many variables into objects and then passing the objects the rude way, because now I need to get out the debugger and see what variables are in the object, and then need to check which of those variables are used in the function. When looking at the body of the function, I don't have a
[07:10:13] <Jong>  nice list of which variables of the object are being used. Instead I need to use search tools in my IDE to try to more the process more efficient.  All of that could have been avoided by passing in the long list of variables

[07:15:40] <flakland> many variables is rude, unless there is a reason to not be using a struct/container
[07:15:42] <vdamewood> MsPoop: Nope. Though you have to go out of your way to write code that is thread-safe but not reentrant.
[07:15:52] <ejjfunky> but then again, anything taken as gospel is problematic.

[07:19:31] <MsPoop> on*
[07:19:37] <MsPoop> you have to go out of your way
[07:19:41] <MsPoop> to imply converse *but*
[07:19:59] <Jong> Most of the time whether the code is clean or a little messy, it doesn't impact productivity, but rather just impacts whether working in the code base is "fun" or "work".   Often wanting "clean code" is a developer who prioritizes desires and wants the company to pay him for it.   That's like a truck driver telling his boss to pay him to clean his truck so his driving is a more pleasant experience.   
[07:20:03] <MsPoop> no you dont have to go out of your way to imply other way
[07:20:04] <MsPoop> wtf
[07:20:13] <MsPoop> wtf

[07:20:43] <Jong> prioritizes *pedantic desires, I meant
[07:21:07] <amigojapan> Jong: you mean a truck driver that cleans up hisown truck
[07:21:11] <MsPoop> thread safe, idepotency, re-entrancy not the same thing
[07:22:05] <Jong> most of the time refactoring code doesn't move the needle forward and it turns into an argument between devs on how the code should be.

[07:44:08] <amigojapan> right ejjfunky

[08:26:09] <epony> coffee tastes better if it's not very concentrated so you can dillute it with plain water and small amount of honey too (optional)

[08:29:41] <epony> remember, sugars metabolise to fat in the body with 50% volume, while fats do that to about.. surprise 50-60% too, so sugar + fat is a double penalty on your health and when you add phosphates you get sick

[09:28:07] <smallville7123> Buartawe: : Model View Architecture?
[09:28:37] <Buartawe> smallville7123: What does that mean?
[09:28:42] <ejjfunky> Buartawe: beyond the basic, hard to say. it depends on the company/team you are working for.
[09:28:45] <vdamewood> burakcank: Algebra, Graph Theory, Set Theory... uhhh.
[09:29:00] <vdamewood> err Buartawe: ^

[09:30:24] <ejjfunky> for me, i think tdd. it just makes lives easier. other than that, everything else really depends.
[09:30:29] <smallville7123> usually there are 3 objects in play (i think the last is for input) ?
[09:30:36] <Buartawe> ejjfunky: What is TDD?
[09:30:48] <ejjfunky> test driven development
[09:30:51] <amigojapan> Buartawe: probably also depends on what kind of programmer, there is a big difference between a game programmer a web prorgammer and a microcontroller prorgammer
[09:30:58] <Buartawe> ejjfunky: How can you tell if someone is doing TDD?
[09:31:00] <smallville7123> but data and render is the least required

[09:31:17] <smallville7123> but data and render is the minimum required to implement the model *
[09:31:39] <Buartawe> amigojapan: Which one of those uses Algebra, Graph Theory, and Set Theory?
[09:31:42] <ejjfunky> Buartawe, other looking at their code? if it breaks when tested, that means he/she is not doing enough testing.
[09:31:49] <smallville7123> eg a Data tree, and a Render Tree that uses the Data Tree to determine how it should render itself
[09:32:04] <Buartawe> ejjfunky: What is the differece between writting tests and doing TDD?
[09:32:12] <smallville7123> eg the DataObject may specify the text that the RenderObject should render
[09:32:12] <amigojapan> Buartawe: I am not sure about those thigs, they sound like math skills to me
[09:32:30] <vdamewood> burakcank: With TDD you write the tests, all of them, before a single line of implementation code.
[09:32:43] <vdamewood> err Buartawe ^
[09:33:01] <Buartawe> vdamewood: So for you TDD means to write all the tests before the code?
[09:33:41] <ejjfunky> Buartawe, essentially. yes. you have to have tests for your code.

[09:38:20] <amigojapan> my question owudl be, before you even desiged the app, how do you know what tests to come up with
[09:38:40] <vdamewood> The idea is you specify your requirements through the tests. Then by writing your implementation to pass the tests you've demonstrated that your implementation meats the requirements.

[09:41:00] <vdamewood> amigojapan: Me neither. Tests are great, but DSS is too far.
[09:41:15] <amigojapan> right
[09:41:20] <vdamewood> TDD, i mean
[09:41:29] <amigojapan> yup
[09:41:32] <ejjfunky> amigojapan, if you're coding something simple like scripts, you don't have to. what i find is that if i am doing something pretty huge or in a team, TDD makes life much easier.
[09:42:37] <ejjfunky> when coding by yourself, one sure sign that you need tdd is when you kept getting the same type of errors or when you change something it breaks. 
[09:42:48] <amigojapan> ejjfunky: maybe it makes sense for business applications
[09:42:56] <vdamewood> One of the big problems with TDD is that you can't expect the requirements to be fully specified up front.
[09:43:19] <vdamewood> Requirements will change as the project progresses.

[13:10:02] <pony> not me
[13:10:24] <no_gravity> It is an interesting question. Let's look at some popular repos and how they do it.
[13:10:45] <PlanckWalk> No, but my IDE autoformat stuff might.
[13:10:55] <PlanckWalk> Looks like no.
[13:11:13] <no_gravity> Let's see what VIM does ...
[13:11:47] <no_gravity> It does not indent empty lines here.
[13:11:54] <PlanckWalk> Is it needed in python?  Or is that only for nonblank lines?
[13:13:06] <no_gravity> What is a recent and popular open source python project we could look at?
[13:13:32] <PlanckWalk> It looks like indentation is discouraged for blank lines in Python
[13:13:46] <PlanckWalk> It's considered trailing whitespace.
[13:15:07] <PlanckWalk> git displays it as an indentation error.
[13:15:08] <no_gravity> Nice. I will just kill all that trailing whitespace.
[13:15:23] <no_gravity> Does it? Let me check.
[13:15:54] <no_gravity> Oh, in Python. Maybe. This is a setup shell script that has some python in strings.

[14:43:14] <Amadiro> pikapika, war doesn't tend to eradicate the bad people and let the good people rise to the top
[14:43:28] <Amadiro> rather, the opposite
[14:44:00] <pikapika> That may be so, but like it or not, there is no better opportunity for someone to discretely kill off a bunch of nazis etc in the fog of war

[14:50:33] <pikapika> Moreover due to history between the reich and the soviets, many of them worship nazi figures as national heros
[14:50:39] <pikapika> In case of Ukraine, it is Stepan Bandera

[14:51:15] <Amadiro> It's true that eastern europe/russia has a bigger problem with this (particularly because they don't crack down on it that hard) but even germany has had quite a history of nazi groupings within the defence force

[18:28:04] <phogg> That's how you get to nightmarish class hierarchies. Class hierarchies are rarely a good idea, especially complex and deep ones.
[18:28:19] <InPhase> ProfSimm: I don't think that matches at all what it was invented for.  That is simply a pedagogical strategy many instructors adopted along the way, and this approach seems to have misled many generations of people who only learned it lightly.
[18:28:28] <phogg> InPhase++
[18:28:42] <dan01[m]> That uses this Server class to send and receive messages, Like "Hi there!", "Welcome!"
[18:28:56] <phogg> it is indeed the 'obvious' way to explain OOP, but people learned the wrong thing from the explanation
[18:29:15] <InPhase> ProfSimm: And additionally, original invention aside, it certainly doesn't represent modern thinking about OOP.
[18:29:29] <phogg> ancient peoples were not wiser than modern peoples
[18:29:33] <dan01[m]> But how can I encapsulate the higher abstraction that uses the server to only be able to say Hi and things like that?
[18:29:49] <dan01[m]> I mean if I expose the Server Send function, anyone can send anything to the server
[18:30:08] <phogg> dan01[m]: you want to limit what can be sent to a specific, enumerated set of messages?
[18:30:13] <phogg> at the higher layer?
[18:30:41] <dan01[m]> phogg: let's say yes, and let's say I use an enum
[18:30:56] <phogg> make a class with a Send() that accepts a literal enum, have it internally contain a reference to Server, and upon Send() convert the enum down to the appropriate bytes for Server
[18:31:13] <dan01[m]> Is it ok to still have the server expose the Send method to higher abstraction, and only limit what can be said at the level of the higher abstraction?
[18:31:39] <phogg> there's nothing wrong with that... although it may not be the best design ever, if it does everything you need then it's fine
[18:31:48] <InPhase> ProfSimm: Consider that the original "objects" were LISP atoms with attributes.  Then in the 60s the notion of associating behavior with objects was introduced.  The core of this notion was from the beginning having abstract encapsulations of data which then had defined behaviors on them.

[18:49:42] <InPhase> dan01[m]: To your recent questions, I would say yes, make the Server object a protected member of your Protocol class, and provide public calls within the Protocol class that support only the supported communications for that level of abstraction.  This allows your Protocol class to provide a guarantee (important!) that all communications comply with the communications protocol.
[18:50:20] *** Joins: AmR (~AmREiSa@156.199.197.9)
[18:50:45] <InPhase> dan01[m]: This is the core of what encapsulation provides you.  Once your Protocol class provides guarantees, and you have checked them and tested them, then all users of that class are going to get behavior that complies with your communications protocol.  Everything higher level therefore no longer has to think about the details of how that protocol works.
[18:50:53] <dan01[m]> InPhase: So have the Server have the Send method public, but because the Server itself is only accessible to Protocol, it's ok. Right?

[20:29:16] <oldlaptop> Ideally, it would reach the point where the "utility function" can reasonably become basic vocabulary within the program
[20:29:31] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: Such as, for example, clean(bedroom) instead of clean_bedroom()?

[22:22:20] <Rounin> It's kind of the default LInux now... But there are other derivatives of Ubuntu that are meant to be more user-friendly still
[22:22:57] <BASHitup> But, it's whatever as far as I see it. It comes with all of the right drivers and it usually requires less work to set up. I also have Debian on this box and Debian requires a lot of work when first getting it running, in terms of setting up the sudo group right, installing all of the dependencies and drivers etc.

[22:29:08] <bjs> deniska: i'm not sure which point you're trying to make
[22:29:12] <BASHitup> Yesterday I messed up my permissions and couldn't sudo into anything. So I had to log into Debian on my other drive and fix the permissions. For someone new to Linux, that might have meant a complete reinstall. 
[22:29:45] <jeaye> Log in as root instead of using sudo then.
[22:29:54] <jeaye> No need for another drive.

[23:20:17] <ThePhilgrim> https://books.google.com/ngrams Google Ngram Viewer let's you search through huge language databases to count instances of words/phrases. Does anybody know how a search can happen almost instantly (there is literally no processing time)?
[23:20:31] <GeDaMo> Indexing?
[23:20:43] <flakland> it must be sorted somehow if it's that fast
[23:21:11] <BASHitup> jeaye: I know how distros are built, dude. For instance, Ubuntu is a fork of Debian 
[23:23:14] <pyzozord> that's it, 500 byte lambda calculus, you win this round, but you'll hear from me again
[23:23:15] <ThePhilgrim> GeDaMo / flakland But how do you sort millions/billions of words and word combinations? Doesn't really seem feasible.
[23:23:58] <flakland> lots of ram

[23:24:32] <flakland> (brute force approach)
[23:25:05] <GeDaMo> You index words along with their offset into the file, that allows you to find words near each other

[23:25:33] <InPhase> ThePhilgrim: This didn't exist when the 5 word indices were generated.  :)
[23:26:19] <InPhase> ThePhilgrim: moderna, vaccine, and flu vaccine all work.  But moderna vaccine does not.
[23:26:26] <user51> can i get some keyboard recommendation?
[23:26:44] <ThePhilgrim> Because there is no instance of "moderna vaccine" in the corpus (language databse)
[23:26:49] <ThePhilgrim> it's from 2019
[23:26:53] <ThePhilgrim> unless you change database

[23:27:26] <ThePhilgrim> So you are saying they have stored every single word combination in that database and the number of occurence?
[23:27:41] <InPhase> Probably everything that passes some count threshold.
[23:28:03] <InPhase> That would confine it to a storable number of things I think.
[23:28:31] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm, that might be reasonable
[23:29:26] <InPhase> For example, I tried "red blue orange yellow".  It fails.  But if I google for "red blue orange yellow" with quotes I get plenty of hits with those colors in that order.
[23:30:07] <ThePhilgrim> So, you're saying that there are not enought occurences for it to be stored in the ngram viewer database?
[23:30:53] <InPhase> "red blue orange" shows up, but it's kind of bumpy and noisy and the numbers on the left are on the scale of 0.0000000100%

[23:32:11] <InPhase> This is how I would solve the problem if I had google's budget for big disk servers.
[23:32:26] <ThePhilgrim> Okay, I was hoping to be able to do something similar for Swedish, but I guess it's not doable to store such a huge amount of data.
[23:32:52] <InPhase> Well it is.  You set the size by setting the threshold.
[23:34:20] <ThePhilgrim> Right, but I would need quite a lot of data for it to be useful
[23:34:21] <InPhase> And it can be done dynamically as one scans along in a random manner, purging the statistically least popular elements.
[23:34:49] <ThePhilgrim> Not completely sure what you mean by that 
[23:35:21] *** Joins: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea)
[23:35:45] <InPhase> Well you maintain a record of ngrams, dates, and counts, scan all of your sources in random order, and then as your storage gets full run purge steps that free up space removing the ones with the lowest counts.
[23:36:16] *** Quits: Tech_8 (~Tech_8@24.51.61.131) (Quit: Client closed)
[23:36:51] <InPhase> So you dynamically adapt your threshold to your storage space, and cross your fingers that randomness will make the purges on average correct choices, with only small variability near the threshold.
[23:37:58] <ThePhilgrim> Ah, think i got it

[23:49:22] <smallville7123> The MeasureSpec class is used by views to tell their parents how they want to be measured and positioned. The base LayoutParams class just describes how big the view wants to be for both width and height
[23:49:24] <smallville7123> this is confusing, as MeasureSpec also specified height and width :(

[23:50:24] <KillerWasp> if i talk about of animations and draws in a visual novel, it's related to programming?
[23:50:43] <flakland> it is confusing, i prefer a top down approach where the container specifies embedded widget layout
[23:51:21] <KillerWasp> i can build a visual novel, but my problem is with the art draws.
[23:51:40] <KillerWasp> this make the game stuck.
