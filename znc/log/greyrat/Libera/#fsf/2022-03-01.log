[04:18:03] <LohanG> hi isf, have you considered owncast as a twitch replacement 
[04:18:22] <isf> i dont use twitch
[04:18:43] <isf> i only want know if exist a replacement to it
[04:18:49] <LohanG> isf : https://owncast.online/
[04:18:59] <LohanG> this works ^
[04:20:21] <isf> i cant run it without nonfree software running in the web page
[04:20:26] <LohanG> it is free software and easy to deploy
[04:20:44] <isf> i cant see this page https://owncast.online/quickstart/
[04:21:07] <LohanG> oh
[04:21:28] <isf> becouse i have a extension called LibreJS who protect my browsing for no execute nonfree software in javascript
[04:21:58] <isf> literal i cant see the pages 
[04:22:00] <LohanG> is try this page? https://owncast.online/quickstart/installation/
[04:23:05] <LohanG> and this https://github.com/owncast/owncast (sorry about the github link)
[04:23:25] <isf> where i can see people doing streams
[04:23:28] <isf> with that software?
[04:24:03] <isf> in any case why not OBS or that software is for other thing?
[04:24:22] <isf> i dont see what is the similar issue with Twitch, im looking a replacement to twitch

[04:32:29] <LohanG> a replacement can mean different things, depending on what you are looking for. In my case I looked for a self-hostable alternative that I can host on my own server. A single user instance that can stream using OBS

[06:22:17] <LohanG> isf, looking at it from a somewhat pragmatic software freedom / autonomy perspective, it makes sense to provide some components as plugins. 
[06:22:26] <LohanG> In Peertube's case the chat requires having Prosody on your server. If everything is bundled by default, people with low resources wont be able to self-host. 
[06:22:41] <LohanG> On the other hand, users who look for a public instance to use, can select based on the enabled features.
[06:23:03] <isf> the issue is the normal users dont go to make the own instance

[06:29:40] <LohanG> It makes sense to see it as a range of replacements, rather than a *single* *ultimate* replacement. If we look at some of the other features in Peertube (and many other fenedared platforms) the same approach applies. Not all instances are similar.
[06:30:06] <LohanG> Different PeerTube instances offer different combinations of features. People are getting used to selecting what they want by checking the features offered in the instance they join. 
[06:30:23] <LohanG> If someone intends to tailor a site as a replacement for twitch, they can brand it and publicize it as such. This opens 
[06:30:51] <LohanG> This opens up avenues for a great degree of freedom imho. 
[06:31:01] <LohanG> On the other hand there are options such as owncast

[17:03:08] <irelativism> linux kernel is going on a unsustainable direction

[17:04:02] <Andrew> qrpnxz: Because (1) Linux licensing sucks (2) Linux devs don't care about user freedom (3) GNU is bloated, busybox is too funny (4) OpenBSD userland is clean (5) Linux likes DRM (6) OpenBSD is secure

[17:38:28] <qrpnxz> if i wanted to download a file, i might as well click on the torrent file link, that will actually MIME open the torrent client
[17:38:50] <qrpnxz> magnet can do this directly, but it has to be a <a href="magnetlinkhere">

[17:53:43] <qrpnxz> so is hyperbola not going to have d-bus and such because lack of interest in maintenance or what? Because I really like GNOME
[17:54:02] <irelativism> d-bus has many problems
[17:54:16] <irelativism> there was a old forum on arch explaining that
[17:54:39] <irelativism> and given on our roadmap we have hyperbolabsd as the main focus
[17:54:46] <irelativism> we will not really need d-bus
[17:54:59] <irelativism> a alternative to d-bus is u-bus
[17:55:19] <irelativism> but that is for embeded stuff, like librecmc and openwrt
[17:55:42] <irelativism> so a lot of work needs to be done to port that to a desktop system

[17:55:59] <irelativism> the issue here is that linux IPC is quite limiting as a message tray for kernel

[17:56:36] <irelativism> so a botched like solution was necessary, we call it d-bus, there are many very old vunerabilities still open
[17:57:14] <irelativism> and a lot of security consequences atached to the architecthure of the whole thing
[17:57:47] <irelativism> there were efforts in the past to improve linux message tray system, sadly were unsucessfull

[17:58:31] <irelativism> that is why d-bus was dropped on this transitional release and message tray solution will come unce hyperbk kernel is adopted.

[18:00:01] <qrpnxz> I think the security concern as far as running untrusted software in linux is low, and I consider losing polished experience like GNOME a big loss. Still I understand the reasons, but that is very unfortunate.

[20:47:02] <[itchyjunk]> Hello
[20:47:52] <ggoes> hi
[20:50:17] <[itchyjunk]> I had heard fsf had moved away from irc. Didn't realize they were keeping a presence here as well.
[20:51:16] <isf> this is the official chat of the FSF itchyjunk 
[20:52:01] <ggoes> no, we're still only on irc
[20:52:02] <[itchyjunk]> neat!
[20:52:11] <ggoes> we just hopped networks

[20:53:56] <mjw> zoe, gefeliciteerd!
[20:54:24] <[itchyjunk]> I have an odd question.
[20:55:02] <[itchyjunk]> Say someone releases code for some "AI" with GNU license. That would technically be a free software right?
[20:55:18] <[itchyjunk]> But to train it would require all the datasets and such.
[20:55:37] *** Quits: jacobk (~quassel@64.189.202.128) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[20:55:40] <[itchyjunk]> So would it not really be free in the same sense?
[20:55:51] <[itchyjunk]> Or am I thinking this wrong?
[20:56:02] *** Joins: zmy (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34)
[20:56:25] <yrk> [itchyjunk]: "AI" is just regular software. so yes, it can be licensed under a strong copyleft like the GPL
[20:56:59] <yrk> [itchyjunk]: the data it is fed could probably be under an independent license, like the difference between the license of mp3-playing software and the license of the mp3
[20:57:00] <[itchyjunk]> Would it make sense to talking about the trained model to be licensed under GPL?
[20:57:13] <[itchyjunk]> yrk, ah i see

Not content with just hammering us with ads, certain megalithic companies named after large rivers or fruits try to foist their "deals" on us as soon as they can.

[22:39:17] <White_Flame> oh, i see the link in the backlog now, search didn't find the sentence itself
