[12:26:50] <Bunny351> so ddg is in the censorship business, now...
[12:28:43] <wasamasa> what do you mean?
[12:31:52] <s-liao> wasamasa as trying breadline egg, after getting into REPL，let us say Ctrl+r like import. then (import (chicken irregex)) come out. Then enter "page up" or "end". it add the extra character [D or [C into like the string "([Dimport (chicken irregex)) ".
[12:32:53] <wasamasa> direct your complaints at readline, not me, lol
[12:36:49] <Bunny351> wasamasa: https://www.theepochtimes.com/duckduckgo-updates-search-engine-will-penalize-sites-associated-with-disinformation_4331495.html
[12:38:54] <s-liao> You mean there is not such function available for breadline egg to integrate. In the bash, it can be done. Like after line buffer come out, we can do 'page up' and 'page dn' in the context.
[12:39:55] <wasamasa> that's not what I said
[12:40:04] <wasamasa> bash uses readline in a very specific way
[12:40:13] <wasamasa> breadline allows you to use readline in a very specific way
[12:40:29] <wasamasa> so go study bash and see how it uses readline and port those settings to your .csirc

[12:43:06] <s-liao> Okay. it is about the settings of readline for bash.
[12:43:09] *** Joins: ecloud (~quassel@192.89.120.58)
[12:44:55] <wasamasa> yes
[12:45:04] <wasamasa> you can tell readline to bind extra commands to keys
[12:45:10] <wasamasa> that's what bash most likely does
[12:45:28] <wasamasa> depending on the terminal, the page up/down key prints out different junk
[12:45:37] <wasamasa> I get ~ here, rather than [D or [C
[12:46:37] <s-liao> yes

[12:47:53] * Bunny351 wonders why line-editing isn't delegated to the terminal instead of doing it at the application level
[12:48:01] <wasamasa> lol
[12:48:10] <wasamasa> you must be one of them plan9 users
[12:48:27] <wasamasa> or worse, emacs users
[12:59:43] <wasamasa> I can imagine that the answer is interactive textual applications
[13:00:24] <wasamasa> there is an intersection between limited interactivity such as repositioning the cursor and drawing on arbitrary places on the terminal
[13:01:07] <wasamasa> I haven't used plan9, just inferno and it struck me as weird that the most basic application is inherently graphical
[13:01:31] <wasamasa> https://depp.brause.cc/mal-candidates/limbo/test.b
[13:01:39] <wasamasa> it gets a drawing context and an argument list

[14:17:16] <Bunny351> well, the CUI/GUI dichotomy is kind of arbitrary and historical
[14:18:05] <Bunny351> using BSD and Linux with a terminal that does line-editing, simplifies a whole lot of things.
[14:18:59] <vandusen> SPAM! SPAM! SPAM! by freee
[14:19:10] <Bunny351> but the idea of having only the choice between arcane terminal madness and bloated gui apps is idiotic, if you think about it

[16:42:07] <teiresias> *NIX not doing line editing in the terminal is part of its worse-is-better philosophy, isn't it?  I mean, look at something like TOPS-20 for instance, which had command completion and command abbreviation baked into the OS and usable from assembly language programs.
[16:46:19] <curium> hello, I'm trying to make bindings for libtls, and an io interface; the C function tls_write takes as input a const void* buffer and a size_t (byte) length, that is a (const c-pointer) and a size_t
[16:47:20] <curium> given a scheme string, how do I extract the corresponding pointer? I'm not sure that object->pointer is correct, for some reason I end up writing stuff that begins with B ..
[16:49:44] <curium> (the B that I see there is from type bits I suppose)
[16:55:46] <Bunny351> teiresias: I rather think it is caused by historical accident, i.e. teletypes
[16:56:35] <Bunny351> curium: c-string should pass a "char *"
[16:57:06] <Bunny351> or use "data-pointer", which excludes the header
[16:57:52] <Bunny351> ah, sorry, scheme-pointer
[17:00:11] <teiresias> If the data can contain NUL, c-string will toss an error.  Probably if you're calling functions that take a pointer and length you might not want c-string.
[17:00:59] <curium> Bunny351: thank you, (scheme-pointer void) works as I wanted

[23:54:30] <Lysandros> irontom, the follow up of the little schemer is good, light and easy (not so great for re-reading, but an interesting journey for beginners). The third one of the series is a bit different, I'd put it aside
[23:55:44] *** Quits: ublx (~ublx@user/ublx) (Quit: ublx)
[23:55:44] <Lysandros> and about SICP (which I also have on paper) I'm not a huge fan. It's well written and the first chapters are ok, but it may give you the wrong ideas about how programming works in general if you don't already have a clear idea
[23:56:15] <Lysandros> *in paper I guess
[23:59:25] <irontom> Lysandros: regarding my ideas about programming, I'm self-taught python programmer trying to learn some of the fundamentals around computing and programming. I really like the format of the Little Schemer, so I'll go ahead and give Seasoned Schemer a go
