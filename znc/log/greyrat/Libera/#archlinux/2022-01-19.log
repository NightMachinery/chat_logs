I can add a boot loader entry, and I can see it popping up in what I believe to be the EFI boot menu on startup, but clicking on it just flashes a blank (black) screen and brings me back to the menu - there must be something I'm doing wrong. any suggestions?

[04:19:25] <cburgard> thanks a lot tirnanog! I don't really have a bootload installed, I was under the impression that with the efibootmgr, I can create a bootloader entry that loads the kernel directly (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/EFISTUB#efibootmgr). am I misunderstanding this?

[04:20:14] <Hello71> or better, just post efibootmgr -v
[04:20:22] <tirnanog> that was addressed to spiral, not yourself. that being said, yes - it is possible to load the kernel directly, though I have not done so myself. you should probably check the parameters that were used.

[04:54:28] <cburgard> tirnanog: should this point to the ESP? I thought this was supposed to point to the root partition of the system. that would explain it I guess :-) as for the kernel/initframfs, they're in /boot, which is where I mount the EFI partition (I thought this would become clear form what I posted, sorry for being so convoluted), so I'd say "yes, they are on the EFI partition"
[04:54:52] <tirnanog> of course.
[04:55:14] <tirnanog> if you ask UEFI firmware to read from anywhere other than an ESP or - at the very least - a FAT32 filesystem, all bets are off.

[06:06:57] <ectospasm> marmalade:  most logs are found in the systemd journal, which is typically accessed on the command line in a terminal emulator through `journalctl`.  You can run `journalctl -perr` to see if there are any errors logged.
[06:07:21] <NetSysFire> do not use -p. errors are potentially not logged as errors
[06:07:42] <NetSysFire> just use journalctl -e or -r or similar and do not filter
[06:08:09] <ectospasm> If you know the approximate time the computer froze, you can add a time window with `journalctl --since <start_time> --until <end_time>`

[06:19:46] <ectospasm> if it's a systemd service you can try `systemctl reload dunst.service`, but not all services handle that properly.
[06:20:04] <ectospasm> You can also try `kill -HUP $(pidof dunst)`
[06:20:18] <ectospasm> ...but that might kill the daemon if it can't handle the hangup signal

[06:22:07] <ectospasm> I don't use these services, so I don't know.
[06:22:29] <Scimmia> so how about waiting for an answser? A notification daemon as a system service doesn't even make sense
[06:22:38] <low-key> thanks, i tried killall dunst and it did the trick

[06:28:41] <NetSysFire> i wouldnt filter at all
[06:28:49] <ectospasm> Yeah, don't filter.
[06:28:58] <NetSysFire> just scroll a bit or use stuff like -b if you had to hard reset
[06:29:08] <NetSysFire> keep in mind that logs might be lost if you hard reset
[06:29:45] <ectospasm> if you pass -b 1 and scroll all the way to the bottom (if you're using less as a pager `G` should jump to the end)

[14:49:35] <mpan> neko2: run a middle Tor relay. A few thousands connections will easily saturate it.
[14:49:59] <mpan> Note that it may not saturate it in terms of bandwidth, but any consumer device will struggle with thousands of active TCP connections.
[14:50:17] <neko2> mpan: the switch isn't in the route to the internet, thst would need extra setup surely?
[14:50:29] <mpan> Though you need to wait a week or so to achieve some sensible saturation. And I do not recommend running it from home if you do not want to face some discrimination.

[15:20:44] <neko2> the device seems to be holding up well otherwise.
[15:21:49] <ouestbillie> so i created a logical volume on top of a volume group which seems to be working but the thing is
[15:22:24] <ouestbillie> the volume group was created from device files on which there was a gpt partition but I didn't create "physical volumes" on them before proceeding
[15:22:31] <ouestbillie> it still seems to be working
[15:22:55] <Khorne> Well, pvdisplay, vgdisplay
[15:23:08] <neko2> ouestbillie: I can't recall if vgcreate will in certain circumstances create PV's automatically. do what Khorne suggested to check I guess.
[15:23:36] <ouestbillie> oh right it did create pvs automatically
[15:23:38] <ouestbillie> okok makes more sense
[15:23:56] <ouestbillie> nothing worse then a reverse bug when thing shouldnt work but they do 
[15:24:02] <Khorne> Heh, true
[15:24:26] <neko2> that said, usually those kinds of tools are conservative. if they detect an existing partition or filesystem signature they'll ask an are you sure. I seem to recall getting such a message at least once.
[15:24:43] <neko2> (e.g. if pvcreate happened automatically)
[15:24:57] <ouestbillie> neko2: it did ask before wiping the existing ext4's but not before creating the pvs
[15:25:10] <neko2> > vgcreate  creates  a new VG on block devices. If the devices were not previously initialized as PVs with pvcreate(8), vgcreate will inititialize them, making them PVs. The pvcreate options for ini‐ tializing devices are also available with vgcreate.
[15:25:21] <neko2> so tl;dr it will wrap pvcreate for you if needed

[15:50:10] <Earnestly> Yes, any tooling is going to have outlay, and that's not much outlay.  My point wasn't to suggest they use fiber though, but as a futureproofing scheme to lay conduits for it if they decide to upgrade.

[16:26:10] <rcf> Earnestly: this is arguably a big problem with the nonlocality of UB in C -- this could be taken to be a valid optimization, because invoking strcmp with a NULL value must never happen in a valid program, and thus the assert() is in fact pointless, regardless of the fact that the NULL value up until that point would have been perfectly allowed if one followed the actual sequence of execution. 
[16:26:51] *** Joins: kolcon (~kolcon@v.kolouch.org)
[16:27:23] <novns> rcf, there are no standard assert(), I use my own assert function that exits if a value is NULL

[16:27:49] <Earnestly> And what I suspect is going on
[16:27:49] <novns> so a compiler should not make assumptions about assert()
[16:27:59] <neko2> rcf: ah yes, the old "this program invokes UB, therefore it's allowed to format your hard drive and do insane things"
[16:28:26] <rcf> novns: the logic would apply regardless. Because a valid program must never pass a known NULL to strcmp, a valid program would never trigger the code path in your function that would lead it to exit. 
[16:28:30] <Earnestly> novns: This is why openbsd and many others remove these null checks eliminations
[16:28:38] <mpan> novns: it doesn’t matter if you use `assert` or your own condition. The condition is allowed to never be executed.

[16:29:24] <rcf> novns: UB is not related to the actual flow of the program. It breaks everything everywhere. C is dumb.

[16:35:37] <BrainDamage> bugzilla is kinda like the call center equivalent of bug reporting, making the experience so unpleasant you hope you'll turn away people without the utmost determination
[16:35:39] <Earnestly> novns: Normally yes
[16:35:47] <rcf> So I would say that even if they do consider this a bug (and if they have a brain they will), this is an excellent example of why C is a terrible language for terrible people (and I say this while using it extensively)

[16:36:27] <mpan> novns: if you want to file a bug report because some NULL check is eliminated, be sure to first understand the actual language. Otherwise you will face an instant NOTABUG. Most bugs reports of that kind are invalid and arise from people inventing their own way the language is supposed to work, without bothering to learn the actual C.

[16:39:25] <rcf> novns: NULL check elimination has been a serious problem in the past and will be a serious problem in the future, and it is not necessarily a bug at all. 
[16:39:49] <novns> I'll report it and see what they will respond
[16:39:52] <rcf> novns: the most famous instance was in the kernel due to violation of aliasing rules. 
[16:39:54] <Earnestly> Use -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks along with other sanitising flags
[16:40:08] <novns> Earnestly, yes, but why
[16:40:12] <rcf> And that was decidedly *not* a bug on the compiler side, even though it broke the exact pattern you are describing. 
[16:40:22] <Earnestly> novns: It's what OpenBSD does, for this reason
[16:40:28] <Earnestly> novns: The why has been explained many times
[16:41:03] <novns> Earnestly, it's like "don't remove wheels from your car when you touch the ashtray"
[16:41:10] <rcf> novns: because dead code elimination tries to outsmart the developer in absurd ways based on the most pedantic interpretation of the standard, and that means breaking a lot of seemingly-sensible patterns. 
[16:41:44] <rcf> novns: complain to WG14. They think that is actually a good idea. 
[16:42:11] <mpan> novns: so far you have failed to provide explanation of why this is a bug in language’s model terms. Which is why I am giving you a friendly warning. You are only explaining it in terms of what you think is intuitive.
[16:42:37] <mpan> And such a bug report is very likely to be instantly dismissed.
[16:42:45] <novns> mpan, it's a bug because it fails to call exit() when requested
[16:42:53] <mpan> Why are you telling that to me? 
[16:43:03] <novns> to everyone
[16:43:06] <novns> and to myself too
[16:43:28] <rcf> You are not talking about C if you think that it needs to call exit() when requested in every situation. 
[16:44:27] <Earnestly> rcf: It is odd though.  I can use argv[2] and it works, argv[1] and it fails.  I can add arguments and argv[1] works, but argv[3] fails
[16:44:28] <mpan> What for? Re-read what I have written, understand. I do not care about your explanations: I am explaining you that you may be wasting your time. Whether your code works or not is irrelevant to that warning. I am also telling to you that the problem is that you do not provide a reasoning based on language model, to which you reply with… a message that is not based on language model. Uhh

[17:12:43] <rcf> MacGyver: no, it's worse than that. Because any use of NULL when passed to strcmp() is undefined, any previous code path that might involve a value that is eventually passed to strcmp() is now assumed to never contain NULL.

[23:53:29] <rcf> tatsumaru: ideally they would provide a patch to do this, but for now you start off with makepkg --nobuild, then edit the files in src/ exactly as described. 
[23:53:37] <arseru> jelle: you said you were unsure what the db does in /var/cache/pacman, only thing I can tell you is these are the notes I had from checking `man aur` at the time of configuring aurutils some years ago https://bpa.st/76UA
[23:53:37] <rcf> tatsumaru: then build with makepkg --noextract

[23:56:25] <mewt> I can also probably wait this out on 96 if there's no fix, as it seems you can force it to run with the profile downgrade

[23:59:32] <agopo> I want to apt remove --purge all php* packages to prepare a clean install of php 8.0 . Only a few php-related packages are meant to stay. But sudo apt remove --purge php-* offers me libapache2-mod-php* libapache2-mod-php7.4* libapache2-mod-php8.0* phpmyadmin* pkg-php-tools* as well. I must be understanding the wildcard wrong. Can anyone help?
