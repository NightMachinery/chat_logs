[00:27:52] <John_Ivan> teraflops, hard to explain but, basically, a clickpad is a touchpad without buttons. the buttons are literarily pressing on the edge of the touchpad itself. my issue? well, I can click. I can tap. I can scroll. it's just that, the touchpad is designed to work with me resting my finger on the edge of the touchpad, which would represent the clicking area and use my other finger to move the cursor around.

[00:28:26] <John_Ivan> the problem is - now, touching that area that's supposed to be for "button", neutralizes the cursor movement. thinking it's me using my two fingers for a horizontal scroll.

[00:40:12] <teraflops> John_Ivan: maybe the touchpad is not well supported yet, did you try to disable the functionalities that are going wrong and set it up as a more firendly less-featureful device?
[00:40:29] <teraflops> it's always a uniqe situation :)
[00:40:37] <John_Ivan> teraflops, actually, here's the thing. on xfce, this problem doesn't happen.
[00:40:41] <Guest6344> basically, this model laptop has an nvidia hdmi output card, and an onboard intel card that should be playing sounds through the laptop speakers. This is "understood" by the system to exist, but, alsa doesn't "install it".
[00:40:45] <John_Ivan> this started when I moved to KDE.
[00:41:50] <Guest6344> haha, fair statement. I checked the alsa wiki carefully to valide that "snd-hda-intel" is the appropriate module to load for my sound card. And I checked the archwiki's compatability charts for simliiar (but not exactly the same) laptop models. All reported sound working out of the box, so I'm pretty stumped.

[01:14:07] <Hello71> John_Ivan: this is simply the standard behavior of libinput. it increases the usable surface area of the touchpad
[01:14:29] <Hello71> macos does the same thing
[01:14:40] <John_Ivan> Hello71, I see. I failed in trying to limit it's surface area. ;/
[01:15:08] <Hello71> it is a change from windows touchpad model, but once you get used to it imo it is significantly better
[01:16:30] <John_Ivan> Hello71, it isn't better I'm afraid.
[01:16:42] <John_Ivan> I cannot both move my cursor and click independently of each other.
[01:16:56] <Hello71> use one finger to do both
[01:16:59] <John_Ivan> it's either one or the other, mutually exclusive events.
[01:17:05] <John_Ivan> not possible in a gaming situation.

[01:17:24] <Hello71> well i mean gaming on a touchpad is terrible no matter what you do
[01:17:49] <John_Ivan> That's an assumption. I game just fine with it as long as it's in the state it is I described without the libinput discrepancy.
[01:17:54] <Hello71> arguably using one finger to click and drag is more intuitive

[04:45:44] <blinux> Though, maybe it would work with it I guess. But not needed for the re-compile etc.

[05:43:48] <kevr> blinux: You can use proton without any of these weird ass packages.

[05:44:44] <blinux> Although I don't know why it exists exactly, because I've seen instructions to use Proton without Steam, so I would think Proton-GE would also work without steam or with Lutris.
[05:45:02] <blinux> And thus the same creator would not have created wine-ge-custom.
[05:45:20] <kevr> blinux: Proton is a project that helps cross platform stuff. Steam themselves internalized it in their application to do the job without other executions.
[05:45:22] <thurstylark> kevr: oh, I am much more https://youtu.be/5icZ0qixzBM about it than it might sound :P
[05:45:33] <kevr> Proton can be used without steam, but the folks at steam configure it particularly for their games
[05:45:38] <kevr> so it tends to work a lot nicer.
[05:45:49] <jamesp> Isn't it pretty cool how the Steam Deck, and Steam OS 3.0 is based on Arch and KDE Plasma?
[05:46:05] * thurstylark thinks it's pretty swell
[05:46:30] <blinux> Yes, I was very pleasantly surprised they switched to Arch based from Debian. I had recently switched from Debian to Arch because I saw the future moving to Arch.
[05:47:01] <thurstylark> way easier to build and maintain a custom distro based on arch imo
[05:47:33] <thurstylark> I was very close to getting my former employer to make a similar move, but I ended up leaving before it came to fruition :P

[05:47:56] <kevr> However, I do have to say, personally, I've still felt like my Windows install runs a few particular games way better than steam with proton on linux.
[05:48:05] <kevr> But, it does do a great job at allowing you to play at all.
[05:48:39] <blinux> For a system that doesn't need to be updated often Debian Stable would be good though. For servers FreeBSD perhaps and for a client machine current with lots of use cases, then Arch I think. Though Debian Unstable is similar.
[05:49:00] <blinux> I used to use Debian Unstable on my client machine.
[05:49:00] <kevr> Ehhhh.
[05:49:03] <thurstylark> kevr: imo that's never not going to be the case for a subset of games, but yeah, it's kick-ass that they run in the first place :P

[05:51:02] <thurstylark> tbh, I've been excited for Proton's potential ever since I heard about it, so seeing it incarnate (and in a handheld, no less) is quite satisfying

[06:56:59] <Dragoon> the kernel config
[06:57:04] <Dragoon> or at least it shouldn't be
[06:57:07] <kevr> Dragoon: seeing as how the only thing involved here seems to be your kernel, there hs to be something making a difference between the two packages.
[06:57:16] <kevr> So, it may not be the config, but how it is packaged.
[06:57:30] <Dragoon> I barely changed the PKGBUILD
[06:57:37] <kevr> in any case, there's a difference between the two kernels you're running, clearly

[07:03:46] <kevr> the kernel doesn't dictate mkinitcpio configs

[12:49:44] <daex> Hi, I'm trying to `Syu` my little SOC running Arch Linux ARM. Pacman says all its databases are up to date, but it's still trying to get `libxcrypt-4.4.23-1`, when the mirrors only have `4.4.24-1` (a more recent version).

[13:53:59] *** Joins: holorum (~holorum@80-95-82-171.pool.digikabel.hu)
[13:54:28] <jmcantrell> like this: https://paste.rs/MF9
[13:54:43] <Namarrgon> that's how you reset the original ExecStart from the original unit
[13:55:05] <sheep> that's mainly relevant when using a drop-in thing to override an existing unit
[13:55:31] <Namarrgon> otherwise the parser might think that you want to only extend the ExecStart of the unit you override
[13:55:44] <WhyNotHugo> I'm using an image from arch-boxes on a hetzner VM, but can't log in. Readme says the password is "arch", but that won't work. Any ideas what might be wrong? I'm basically following the wiki instructions.
[13:56:25] <jmcantrell> extend it? by appending?
[13:56:38] <dvzrv> WhyNotHugo: not super sure, but #archlinux-releng might also be a good place to ask :)
[13:56:46] <Namarrgon> jmcantrell: yes

[13:57:06] <WhyNotHugo> dvzrv: I'll give that a try, thanks.
[13:57:23] <Namarrgon> jmcantrell: appending in the sense that units can have multiple ExecStart lines, not appening to the existing ExecStart

I have a uploaded the 202010801 cloudinit image and generating an instance works fine, but if I try to use "In-transit encryption" the VNIC is logging a load of dropped ingress packets.

I'm wondering whether this is something I can "fix" in the custom image settings, or whether

[15:51:08] <wasamasa> I've installed glxinfo today and think I've come closer to figuring out why qutebrowser and chromium are failing on me with GLSL compilation errors
[15:51:28] <wasamasa> http://ix.io/3vrZ
[15:51:41] <wasamasa> mesa gives me opengl 4.5, but the intel driver glsl 4.20
[15:51:53] <wasamasa> and chromium assumes it can use glsl 4.50 and fails
[15:52:12] <wasamasa> what's the preferred way of fixing this?
[15:52:16] *** sharperguy__ is now known as sharperguy
[15:52:29] <wasamasa> just lying about the opengl version, using llvmpipe or something else?

[17:08:52] <hashworks> So I'm having this situation that I'm don't always have audio devices connected (since they are turned off). Using pipewire-pulseaudio this leads to the problem that when some applications start without an audio output device, they don't pick one up later until I restart those applications. Same problem seems to occour when I take away all audio devices for a while when they are already running.
[17:08:54] <hashworks> So I was thinking about adding a permanent audio output dummy â any idea how to do that? Thing is, searching for that only leads to forum threads like "my PA only shows a dummy device and nothing else" :D

[17:25:01] <tzlil> removed it and it seemed to alleviate some of the lag, but its come back after a restart, anyone know whats happening? (this is a more general issue so i thought id ask in the arch channel rather than artix)

[23:56:37] <Namarrgon> dunno
