[00:02:51] <gaude> i have a usecase and ideally like to influence that, i know i can force loading everything with BIND_NOW but I dont know if the os will automatically unload the library again when not required. if there is the same on the function leven i'd be even more interested
[00:03:01] <Guest96fd> What's going on with this variadic function? I would have expected to see "a", "b", "c": https://bpa.st/W6DQ
[00:04:38] <omegatron> a modern os will at least cache a once loaded and "prepared" library for as long as possible to reduce program starting time
[00:04:44] <ChoHag> gaude: How do you expect the OS to know?
[00:04:57] <ChoHag> Easier for it to swap unwanted pages out.
[00:04:59] <omegatron> or do you mean "unload the library" in your program, while it is running?

[00:28:49] <ChoHag> That's your linker complaining that it can't find the archive/library libiconv_open is in.
[00:29:44] <omegatron> steerpike: depending on your os, you most likely either have to link your program against the c lib or some extra iconv library
[00:30:00] <omegatron> that way, those undefined symbols can be found and linked against
[00:30:09] <ChoHag> If you de-cargo-cult your invocation, and also fix that problem, you may have a better idea what's going on: cc -o a2m a2m.c -liconv
[00:30:36] <fizzie> The external-library version of GNU libiconv does `#define iconv_open libiconv_open` and `#define iconv libiconv`.

[01:56:54] <fizzie> C11 5.1.1.2p1, translation phase 3: "Each comment is replaced by one space character." So yes, they are definitely discarded. Doesn't mean their presence or absence couldn't still affect warnings "before" that happens, though.

[01:58:19] <concrete-houses>  cryptonector you mean I can't learn c the 60s way and get rich?
[01:58:20] <fizzie> I've always found GCC's list at -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3 level amusing, because it's so specific.
[01:58:38] <concrete-houses> can tcc pretty much do it all?
[01:58:57] <concrete-houses> or do I need gc or what is it clang/llvm to do c?
[01:59:28] <cryptonector> ChoHag: so, the default behavior in C switch cases is to "fall through" to the next case unless you "break;", well, that was a Bad Idea and the cause of many bugs, so linters developed this convention for /* FALLTHROUGH */ to mark that "I want this fallthrough, don't warn me", and then eventually clang and gcc learned this and added a "statement attribute" for "falls through"
[01:59:38] <cryptonector> ChoHag: then gcc removed support for the comment
[01:59:55] <cryptonector> concrete-houses: no, you can't, because C didn't exist in the 60s

[12:11:48] <veltas> Although it's less 'portable' maybe, I think you maybe can't guarantee cast from char* to other object pointer types, not sure. I quietly doubt the existence of platforms where this matters

[18:55:26] <omegatron> replace your tab characters with the sequence you need and then feed that to your printf() call
[18:56:05] <omegatron> you could write a printf() wrapper, which has additional format specifiers and does exactly that
[18:56:25] <cassepipe> I am interested in priting strings rather
[18:57:06] <omegatron> how does that contradict with my proposed solution?
[18:57:42] <cassepipe> I was just wandering if I could avoid all the string handling
[18:57:52] <cassepipe> But yeah I can write a wrapper
[18:58:24] <omegatron> this is C - you are in control - and if some c library function doesn't do what you want, you have to do it yourself - or look for third party libraries which implement it

[19:02:36] <Sos> "hello" TAB "world"
[19:02:48] <cassepipe> Sos: I am afraid I already know that but thanks for pointing that out as it is typically the kind of thing that may have confused me when I started C
[19:03:01] <pragma-> He wants to output. No realloc needed for that. Just go through the string character by character and test if it's a '\t' and if so then output '\' and 't' otherwise output the character itself.
[19:03:03] <Sos> adn switching defines will switch that
[19:03:21] <Sos> ahh, i get it
[19:03:31] <cassepipe> pragma-: You mean with a bunch of calls to write ?
[19:03:41] <pragma-> Deja vu.
