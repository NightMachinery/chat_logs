[01:09:21] <johncs> Using better-sqlite will mean that search will be synchronous and it could be quite long depending on the size of the data to search. We could put it onto another thread if we up our minimum node version to 12ish.
[01:09:45] <johncs> All-in-all I don't really know that better-sqlite is providing more pros than cons.
[01:10:13] <Activ8> will that have an impact on file size
[01:10:20] <johncs> no
[01:10:44] <Activ8> is any more data been stored in the sql file at all 
[01:11:16] <johncs> The PR mentioned you wanted better-sqlite for some packaging reasons bookworm. How strong are those reasons? And do you have an overall opinion about the worthwhileness of the transition to better-sqlite?
[01:12:44] <johncs> Pinging MaxLeiter for your thoughts too. I mainly took over this PR just because it would be harder to merge in after I do the reactions work, I don't really have any motivation for bringing in better-sqlite besides the fact that nacho thought it'd be a good idea.
[01:13:52] <johncs> I'm basically asking: do you two think it's worth doing the work to change to better-sqlite, given that there will be some work? Because we could just not transition.
[01:14:12] <johncs> No, that's not the tradeoff Activ8.
[01:14:32] <Activ8> just double checking johncs
[01:23:50] <bookworm> Nacho? Boy that's one way of saying _Nachtalb I haven't seen before üòÖ

[01:24:16] <johncs> Haha damn, my bad, just mixing up names in my head
[01:24:40] <Activ8> lmao
[01:24:45] <Activ8> I just spat tea out
[01:24:56] <bookworm> I mean the library surely advertises itself as being better... however for us I don't think those points matter much, but I can very well be wrong
[01:25:24] <Activ8> right click _nachtalb > nickname > nacho "nacho has entered chat"
[01:26:05] <johncs> Yeah, if the benefits are tangible for our case I haven't seen them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[01:26:37] <johncs> Performance seems fine as-is.
[01:27:42] <johncs> Supporting an external db would probably be how I'd argue to support very large installations if we wanted to up our performance in a dramatic way anyways
[01:33:12] <bookworm> as for packaging it makes no difference, they both fo the same thing with node-gyp
[01:33:40] <bookworm> it's all C, no matter how you twist and turn it, C is annoying in js land
[01:34:36] <bookworm> if you are lucky there's binary blobs (for some kind pf lucky, ask the nix people what they think about that) if not you try to build from source which needs a sane C env
[01:34:54] <bookworm> anyhow, I'm off to bed. See you some other time

[09:44:09] <fnutt> Having synchronous loading of search will be horrible for slow servers or large sqlite db's.

[10:14:08] <johncs> But there's ways to mitigate the issues even outside of doing the work on another thread (which would solve the issue completely at the cost of needing a newer node than we currently require). For example, using sqlite's full text search extension to index messages would ensure that the query is always quick enough, even for very large dbs.

[17:16:00] <Activ8> bookworm I accidentally deleted the commit on my side I forgot it was referenced to patch-1 üå©Ô∏è lol sorry!  
[17:16:22] <Activ8> I thought all the comments where very valid I‚Äôm thinking on how to do it 
[17:16:46] <Activ8> I saved my last commit luckily had it in a text file
[17:17:18] <bookworm> it's very hard to delete commits in git
[17:17:26] <bookworm> you could easily get it back
[17:18:02] <bookworm> it's also still available from GH itself
[17:21:57] <Activ8> It‚Äôs hard to delete commits? All I did was delete the repo attached to that commit and when I went to the PR it said commit not available and I realized it was referenced from my repo branch - can you still see the code?
[17:22:36] <Activ8> I can certainly reopen it that‚Äôs fine I thought I lost the commits
[17:23:31] <bookworm> depends a bit, did you modify it locally or just via the web UI?
[17:23:49] <bookworm> and yes, I can still see the code
[17:24:38] <Activ8> Used the web UI

[17:25:25] <Activ8> i was going to do another PR wasn‚Äôt sure how to fix what I did 
[17:25:34] <Activ8> I saved the code anyway
[17:33:21] <omnidapps> if you don't do `git gc`, you can recover commits using the `reflog`
[17:35:32] <Activ8> Even if the branch and repo has been deleted via GUI?

[23:42:40] <Koopz> i'm migrating services to a new server and been wondering wether i should migrate my ZNC instance as well or just let TheLounge directly connect to the IRC networks
[23:47:26] *** Quits: Activ8 (aab_@user/aab/x-3846634) (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[23:47:56] <johncs> Some people definitely are
[23:48:02] <johncs> I originally set up the lounge to use ZNC
[23:48:22] <johncs> But then tore it down. I wasn't getting any benefit at all from it.
[23:52:35] <johncs> I guess the real quesiton is: is ZNC providing a feature you want that you can't get out of using The Lounge exclusively?
[23:55:05] <bookworm> it's nice if you're hacking on the TL code for starters ;)
