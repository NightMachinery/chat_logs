[14:14:43] <nikow> Yeah, i hit that problem too at some point when my app was constantly tring to add data. Now i do checkpoint manually every few minutes with `TRUNCATE` flag.

[18:57:31] <Chunky_Ks> my mental model of WAL files is that if you don't checkpoint them, then yes, they can grow out of control
[18:58:43] <Joanna> I’ve never used a wall file that I know of
[18:59:37] <Joanna> Wal
[19:00:08] <Joanna> When do you need them?
[19:02:48] <Chunky_Ks> https://sqlite.org/wal.html
[19:02:53] <Habbie> WAL mode is the best concurrency model for sqlite
[19:03:12] <Chunky_Ks> WAL lets you have many readers OR one writer, vs the other modes that let you have many readers XOR one writer
[19:03:30] <Habbie> WAL even allows you to have many readers AND one writer
[19:03:52] <Chunky_Ks> ^-- tried to imply with OR vs XOR
[19:03:57] <Habbie> oh right
[19:04:01] <Habbie> words are hard
[19:04:11] <Chunky_Ks> but I guess AND does make more sense when explaining it vs nuances of logic gates
[19:04:22] <Habbie> actually now i'm leaning towards OR
[19:04:24] <Habbie> but we digress :)
[19:04:54] <Chunky_Ks> according to that doc, there's also high potential for sqlite to go faster with WAL than the other journal modes, although I will say that despite my best efforts, I have had no success getting WAL to do anything other than be slower
