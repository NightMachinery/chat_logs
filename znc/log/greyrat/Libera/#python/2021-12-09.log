[00:07:47] <stewie925> hi all, so I have been replacing os.path with pathlib.Path, and I am getting error when trying to do a json.dump on a Posix Path object - https://bpa.st/GJ3Q
[00:08:14] <bjs> stewie925: json.dump takes an open file, not a path
[00:09:04] <Wulf> AoC8 - https://ideone.com/8g6B5W
[00:09:08] <grym> with pathlib i like to Path('thefile.json').write_text(json.dumps(theobject)) anyway
[00:09:21] <grym> write_text is a context manager
[00:09:24] <grym> nice and tidy
[00:09:32] <boris[m]> hello ! I am trying to render frames captured by opencv to a QVideoWidget (pyqt) . So far I have this : https://paste.debian.net/1222614/ but I only get a black frame. Does anyone have any idea what I might be missing ?
[00:09:51] <stewie925> thank you bjs and grym!
[00:10:11] <stewie925>  Grym - I will try the write.text

[00:15:03] <stewie925> so that is nice, the PosixPathObject.write_text() does not need the "with open()" statement
[00:15:14] <grym> correct, it's got one inside
[00:15:21] <stewie925> oh shoot...
[00:15:23] <grym> you can also `with Path(something).open()...`
[00:15:47] <stewie925> grym, oh I think I like you second one better
[00:15:48] <grym> .read_text(), .read_bytes(), write_bytes() are all context managers too
[00:16:02] <grym> useful for snarfing in small files in one shot

[00:16:53] <grym> dump_string_
[00:17:03] <stewie925> ahhh crap, youre right
[00:17:16] <grym> dump does expect a file pointer; dumps just returns the string

[00:22:34] <grym> stewie925: i tend to like .read_text and .write_text for json, especially, because incremental parsing of json is weird/hard anyway and it's typical to always want the whole file
[00:23:34] <aphysically> now I made the reduction symmtric :^) https://bpa.st/M3KA
[00:25:06] <stewie925> grym: yeah the PosixPathObject.write_text is nice and clean, though it may take a while for me to get used to it, because I've been soooo used to the usual `with open() ` context manager

[00:25:33] <grym> stewie925: yeah.  use it where it's appropriate
[00:25:34] <stewie925> but I want to use pathlib.Path, it is SOOOOO much better than using the old os.path
[00:25:48] <grym> but nothing wrong with `with open` or `with thepath.open(...)`
[00:26:09] <grym> (open() takes paths, so that's cool)
[00:26:22] <stewie925> ohhh
[00:26:32] <grym> i've gotten to the point where the libraries that don't like paths always make my code crash in testing because i forget to str() things when i have to

To solve thinks out I  check a lot on internet if it’s resol

[02:46:24] <mefistofeles> hzm74: there is always a time for programmers to check how other people have solved similar problems (if not the same), so it could boil down to copying/pasting solution from others. But also, practice makes that less and less required, I can see how I can write now dozens or maybe hundreds of lines of code and have it correctly in the first try

[02:48:12] <mefistofeles> funnily, those things are commonly also motivated with practice, a trivial example is when you find yourself executing the same lines of codes over and over again, then you realize you could wrap them in a function and call only that function, and things like that

Experienced programmers should be able to get to the optimal solution more quickly and not because they can write code without syntax errors, but because how to divide the problem into smaller and familiar ones that they already know how to solve

[03:45:45] <phox> so suppose I'm using tox, and suppose what I'm working in is a project with packages in random nested subdirs that during build (later) get installed properly into the production env, but suppose I want those installed now by tox... can I (a) make tox do something clever or (b) maybe meddle with my top-level __init__.py or something to coerce things into sanity?
[03:46:22] <phox> and/or using top-level setup.py (not sure if I can alias module paths via setuptools.setup() ??)
[03:47:37] <Yhg1s> phox: the point of tox is that it is exactly like a regular install. Because it is a regular install. So yes, you should install those packages. You can tell tox what commands to run to install them.

[04:06:23] <phox> Yhg1s: the build system (not *mine*, and I'm not really in a position to monkey with it at present) copies some subdirs into other places during build/deploy, so technically they're already there as part of the tox venv but they're not at the right package/module paths (they're in some subpath, in the repo)

[04:06:55] <Yhg1s> phox: okay, well, then replicate those copy commands in your tox install step.
[04:07:18] <phox> so trying to hack around that in the cleanest way possible, e.g. we're not even using setup.py or (probably) the top-level __init__.py so if either of those can alias module paths to others that would be great
[04:07:20] <Yhg1s> phox: or write setup.py/setup.cfg/pyproject.toml files that do the same copies.
[04:07:51] <Yhg1s> phox: you can mess with things that way, yes, by modifying sys.path, but it's a really, really bad idea. Way worse than replicating what the actual deployment looks like.
[04:08:35] <phox> Doesn't that get fairly ugly, insofar as I think tox uses a symlink to the current path from inside of the venv, so I need my setup.py to mangle the repo tree to do the "copies"?
[04:08:57] <phox> or does it/do I copy thing into the repo path or whatever?
[04:09:20] <phox> trying to make sure I am following decently idiomatic behaviour here rather than just wiggling things about until they seem to work for now
[04:09:24] <Yhg1s> phox: I don't understand what you think is a symlink, sorry. I also don't know what you need to copy where. Do you have symlinks in your package?

[04:13:43] <Yhg1s> or, anything you need to do to install the package.

[04:20:14] <nedbat> phox: sounds intricate.  It will pay dividends in the long run to straighten that out.
[04:20:15] <Yhg1s> phox: it's not a good idea to make setup.py do anything besides declare things. (It's even better not to have a setup.py file, and just use setup.cfg or pyproject.toml). If you have complicated steps that you're currently not doing in the setup.py file, don't try to get them in there.
[04:20:37] <phox> for my purposes there's /apps/.../fooapp.py (many) and /supporting_libs/.../libA/xyz.py but the fooapps assume they can just 'import fooA'

[04:27:03] <phox> so if I'm putting stuff into tox.ini to do the ~same thing the build system is doing with the /supporting libs/ paths... can I do that such that (a) the result is only in the tox venv and (b) they're installed "editable"?
[04:27:35] <phox> i.e. can I do it such that it works similarly to *multiple* pip install -e (but without setup* so with skipsdist=true)?
[04:27:58] <nedbat> phox: you can do a lot from a tox.ini
[04:28:16] <Yhg1s> it's really not about tox, but about installing things in Python.
[04:28:38] <Yhg1s> You can do the same thing that pip install -e does, which is a .pth or .egg-link file listing directories that should be added to the module search path.

[04:36:52] <phox> Yhg1s: understanding that yeah.  directly modifying the link files seems more hacky than I'd like, and inconveniently it looks like tox is mostly normalized to pre-test commands rather than venv setup commands, I think?
[04:37:20] <phox> so some of it is about tox, which is if I do this via tox's config making sure this impacts the venv not just the test runs...

[06:07:46] <nedbat> phox: i think tox doesn't implement full shell syntax like you want
[06:07:56] <nedbat> i could be wrong about that
[06:08:20] <phox> nedbat: ah so maybe sh -c '...' or bash -c '...'
[06:08:23] <phox> will try that thanks
[06:08:37] <phox> it talks about embedded shell scripts but gives very little detail
[06:09:50] <phox> I guess now I get to discover whether it interpolates inside of quotes or concatenates tokens without separating whitespace or what all it does with its mangling, lol
[06:10:55] <phox> nedbat: seems to have been the issue, tyvm!!
[06:11:01] * phox headdesk for the day

[06:13:45] <nedbat> phox: sorry, what was wrong with commands_pre?
[06:14:09] <phox> nedbat: that it couldn't handle the redirection inline, even though the documents talk about "inline shell scripts" or whatever
[06:14:23] <phox> so replaced echo foo > baz with /bin/sh -c 'echo foo > baz'
[06:14:41] <phox> oh sorry, you mean wrong with vis-a-vis the patching I mentioned?
[06:15:07] <nedbat> phox: i mean, why do you need to contribute a patch?
[06:15:08] <phox> conceptually the thing I added is part of environment configuration, not part of the test run, so it would be better to have it separated into that operation but there's no such facility at present

[09:51:40] <node1> I have tried setting the virtual environment  `python3 -m venv venv; ipython3 kernel install --user --name=venv`
[09:51:59] <node1> then on jupyter page pointed out venv. But i have found after doing this it's unable to import module.

[09:54:59] <node1> Any idea?
[09:55:15] <twb> doofenshmirtz: it's much nicer to use, and it has a separate datatype that isn't just str
[09:55:43] <doofenshmirtz> can you not activate your env and then run `jupyter notebook` from the env?
[09:56:26] <twb> jinsun: runtime-programmable multiple inheritance (i.e. a MOP), and generic functions (i.e. methods aren't "members" of any one class, i.e. multiple dispatch).
[09:57:51] <jinsun> okay more terms I don't understand :D
[09:58:17] <jinsun> methods that aren't members of any class are just normal functions no?

[14:09:27] <bailsman> Hi guys I have a 2d array with 1s and 0s, where 1 is land and 2 is water. Given a location in the array, I want to know the size of the 'island'. I've implemented a depth first search where I replace the 1s I've seen with '-' and then return the total size
[14:09:48] <bailsman> question: is there a standard library function or scipy algorithm or something like that that I can use to do the same thing without implementing the algorithm myself?

[15:01:40] <Wulf> doofenshmirtz: https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html
[15:01:43] <grawity> the stdlib literally has bindings for GNU readline
[15:01:57] <grawity> (which the python REPL uses)
[15:02:35] <doofenshmirtz> Wulf, thank you. didn't know about such a library existed.
[15:02:42] <grawity> but I also wouldn't be surprised if some of those everything-for-your-CLI packages (like 'click' maybe) had their own input libraries, too

[15:02:52] <doofenshmirtz> it is literally named readline. stupid me.
[15:03:12] <grawity> hmm no click has only very basic input
[15:03:29] <Wulf> doofenshmirtz: did you know that "doof" in German means "stupid"?
[15:04:35] <doofenshmirtz> ha ha no. I just watch Phineas and Ferb and I like Vanessa Doofenshmirtz.

[15:06:50] <Wulf> doofenshmirtz: I can only guess. Wikipedia suggests that Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz is indeed German. "shmirtz" isn't a German word, but might be based on mispronunciation of the common surname "Schmidt" (like Smith in English). So, "Mr. stupid Smith"?

[15:27:38] <FastJack> shmirtz isn't really a german word. sounds like nonsense. sounds a bit like "Schmitz" which is a common german last name.

[18:48:11] <han-solo> maybe you didn't call the `run` or `main` function or whatever entry point it had
[18:48:58] <Deneb> its the accepted answer in this Stack Exchange post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9319317/quick-and-easy-file-dialog-in-python

[18:51:29] <deniska> stwange: and more generally, `for i in range(things): do_something_with(things[i])` is an antipattern, it should be `for thing in things: do_something_with(thing)`
[18:51:32] <stwange> deniska, I combined for one line, but the field names will be an array (and the ? are already pulled dynamically, ie. if exist then add to array in order, otherwise "null"), so I wanted to leave the option to change the fields
[18:51:33] <han-solo> er, 3
[18:51:46] <han-solo> for 3, use the first snippet

[18:52:06] <stwange> Ah ok that makes sense
[18:52:12] <jinsun> Deneb: but you copied the python 2 variant from the answer
[18:52:24] <Deneb> it seems neither 'tkinter' nor 'Tkinter' work.

[20:18:56] <bjs> petaflot: the warning is telling you that you your `GPIO.setup(GPIOs[pin][0], GPIO.IN, pull_up_down = GPIO.PUD_DOWN)` might go wrong because the pin is physically pulled up already

[20:22:59] <han-solo> so it's easier to parse
[20:23:29] <bjs> Guest00: https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/#timeouts  implies you get a requests.exceptions.Timeout exception, so you can just catch that and try again if you want
[20:23:31] <ali1234> petaflot: the resistors are on the raspberry pi board, not your hat. they are required to make i2c work properly.

[20:24:57] <bjs> petaflot: https://pinout.xyz/ pins 2&3 are for the I2C, and there fixed resistors on those pins pulling them up.  Use other pins for general-purpose I/O where you do not want pull-up

[20:28:00] <petaflot> ali1234: well they can be overriden by a unintentional solder bridge for instance....
[20:28:03] <Deneb> so why does my distro say its up to date when I have 3.8.2 and there is 3.9 in the repository?
[20:28:12] <Guest00> no i appreciate all your advice han-solo you have helped me a lot the past 2 days
[20:28:38] <Deneb> vlt: thanks for the note on pyenv
[20:28:38] <ali1234> petaflot: the purpose of a pull resistor is to prevent the pin from cycling randomly between high and low if nothing else is driving the pin, but to be overridable if something else *is* driving it, hence the observed input on a pin cannot tell you whether there is a pull resistor on it or not.
[20:28:40] <bjs> Deneb: do you have 3.9 installed as well?

[21:15:13] <complexnumber> I don't know if this is a Python or Debian problem. I'm trying to install a python 2 module with pip, but when I run pip I get: Requirement already satisfied: impacket in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (0.9.21)

[21:16:46] <grym> MacGyver: would that it were so, but it very much is not
[21:17:02] <bjs> deadmund: quick quiz what does `for item in some_list: some_list.remove(item)` do :P

[21:20:16] <MacGyver> grym: No, I'm recalling a discussion with a Debian user proclaiming that because they mangle pip to behave, it's better than Arch which doesn't do that.

[21:49:36] <ZMarkC> Hi I have a question about how python decides variable types. I am using the Uptime Robot API, and it returns JSON. I would like it to be stored as a dictionary, but dict() seems unwilling
[21:49:53] <CrtxReavr> Class inheritance is trasitive.
[21:49:54] <yitz> json.loads()
[21:50:09] <CrtxReavr> transative even
[21:50:11] <ZMarkC> During testing, I just copied one sample output and assigned it using "output = <insert my paste here>". Python assigned my pasted content as a dict type variable, but cannot do the same with dict(response.text)
[21:50:46] <grym> ZMarkC: json.loads(response.text)
[21:50:58] <han-solo> are you using `requests` ? if yes, `.json()`
[21:51:02] <grym> or possibly look at type(response.json) or type(response.json()), which may exist or might not
