[03:05:09] <AMPed> I need to undo some pushed changes to master, so I'm planning to 'git checkout master', 'git revert' the commits, switch to the correct branch, and 'git cherry-pick'. 2 questions: (1) is that a good strategy, and (2) do I cherry-pick in the same order, or reverse, from the reverts (which are chronologically backward)?
[03:06:03] <AMPed> (I.e, the reverts are most recent first, so should the cherry-picks be most recent last?)

[03:08:27] <cbreak> do you work with someone else that would be bothered by history rewriting?
[03:09:19] <AMPed> cbreak: nope, the other person knows what I'm up to.
[03:09:51] <cbreak> so you could rewrite history
[03:10:00] <AMPed> I pushed several (ugh--*several*) commits to master that should have gone to a different branch; nothing else has been pushed for a while.
[03:10:13] <cbreak> you can go to the branch you want the stuff to be
[03:10:22] <cbreak> git cherry-pick A..B the commits you want
[03:11:16] <cbreak> (A is the parent of the first commit you want to cherry-pick, as usual)

[03:12:34] <cbreak> after you're done getting the commits over, you can go to master and rewrite history to remove them
[03:12:54] <cbreak> for example with a git reset --hard, if you want to reset all commits until the current, including it
[03:13:04] <cbreak> or git rebase -i if you want to remove selectively
[03:13:08] <cbreak> afterwards: force push
[03:13:24] <cbreak> I'd only use revert if history rewriting is not possible or not advisable for some reason

[03:16:35] <cbreak> if you want to get 7ff927a
[03:16:48] <cbreak> and all commits after it, up to and including 785272

[10:31:44] <aram> Hi. I want to extract a subdirectory from an upstream project into a new fork, with history. I can do that with git-filter-repo. But can I merge from upstream in the future? And conversely, can I merge from my fork to upstream in the future? I suspect the answer is "no" to both questions.

[10:47:25] <aram> I am working on a new compiler based on the Go compiler backend.
[10:47:25] <aram> I want to keep the history of the Go compiler backend, and integrate changes back upstream, and of course continue to integrate upstream changes in my fork.

[20:04:50] <cousteau> the file output.txt will NOT contain the line you're complaining about, and that line will instead be printed on screen rather than redirected to output.txt
[20:06:01] * cousteau hopes his hypothesis that the line was being printed to stderr is correct, otherwise I've been making a fool of myself
[20:08:25] * cousteau checks and is relieved to see that he was right.  Probably should have done this before though.

[20:48:35] <foo> Soliton: thank you.
[20:50:31] <cousteau> Can I see when did I pull?  (at which date and time did I merge origin/master into master?)
[20:51:06] <cousteau> Or... What was that command that showed info of how branch tips have been moving in my local repo?
[20:53:13] <j416> cousteau: the merge commit will have a date, yes
[20:53:21] <j416> cousteau: git show <mergecommit>
[20:53:37] <cousteau> It was a fast forward
[20:54:00] <j416> then there's no merge
[20:54:13] <cousteau> And I suppose that'd show me when the commit was committed, not when I merged it
[20:54:29] <j416> I don't think the reflog keeps a timestamp
[20:54:30] <imMute> cousteau: the reflog is what stores how branch tips have been moving (among other things)
[20:54:41] <cousteau> ...I mean, a fast forward merge is still a merge, right?
[20:54:47] <j416> not really
[20:54:51] <imMute> cousteau: no, there's no commit.  it just moves the branch pointer
[20:54:56] <cousteau> imMute: OK I'll look into it
[20:55:26] <j416> why do you need this info?
[20:55:58] <j416> reflog can help you get back to where you were before you did that fast-forward, if you prefer
[20:56:08] <j416> perhaps you already know which commit you were at, in which case you can reset to that
[20:56:17] <cousteau> I want to know when I merged the remote master, which is doing something weird, so that I can figure out if it's something I did recently or a long time ago

[20:56:59] <cousteau> I'm considering rewinding my local master one commit, because honestly I have no idea why they put this weird stuff in master
[20:56:59] <j416> cousteau: it'll allow you to binary-search your history to find the commit that introduces something (typically an error, but can be anything)
[20:57:16] <j416> if you only have a handful of commits, you could simply check out each and see.
[20:57:40] <j416> bisect is useful if you have more commits than you're comfortable checking
[21:01:11] <cousteau> The story is: someone committed stuff to master (only 1 commit) some time ago.  At some point in time, I decided that it was a good idea to sync my local master with the remote master, so I merged the remote master, which was ahead by 1 commit.  Now I'm starting to question if that made sense, because honestly I have no idea why they committed that piece of code to master, so I'm considering whether I should leave my master as it was before, yell at them for
[21:01:11] <cousteau> committing to master, and make them rewind master and stop messing with it
[21:03:18] <cousteau> But, alas, I have a very short term memory, and can't remember when I fast forwarded my master to match the remote one.  If it's something I did a long time ago, then I guess I did it for a good reason.  But if it's something I did in the last few weeks then probably it was a decision I should reconsider.

[21:13:17] <cousteau> So the git reflog shows the order in which operations were applied to branches (even when a branch was manually moved to point to another commit, rewinded, forwarded, rewinded again, etc), i.e., it shows information that doesn't appear in the commit graph and is "local only" (doesn't get pushed to the remote repo), correct?  But it doesn't show the timestamp of when that happened, only the fact that it did
[21:13:17] <bncn> I want my master branch to be deployed automatically when I push, I guess I need to use jenkins for this purpose, but since I'm not gonna use it in local area network and gonna use digitalocean droplets, I'm wondering about the easiest and safest way for doing this

[21:13:47] <gitinfo> Git is not a deployment tool, but you can build one around it (in simple environments) or use it as an object store(for complex ones). Here are some options/ideas to get you started: http://gitolite.com/deploy.html

[21:17:28] <strega-nil> hello all! I have a question about local git repos (like, `file://` repos); in Linux CI, I get an error about requesting an unadvertised object, but this seems to work locally. I find it very weird that a filesystem repo would disallow getting an unadvertised object, since there isn't any server software running; it should just be a filesystem
[21:17:28] <strega-nil> access. am I incorrect about these assumptions?
[21:17:33] <mackerman> bncn: There is no best tool, only opinions on what you like
[21:17:36] <strega-nil> specifically, the following command `/usr/bin/git fetch /mnt/vcpkg-ci/buildtrees/vcpkg-from-git-test/test-git-repo 3b55ce2b4098a4b9694bf1821f671b537f91bbb1 --depth 1 -n` results in the error `error: Server does not allow request for unadvertised object 3b55ce2b4098a4b9694bf1821f671b537f91bbb1`

[21:25:02] <cousteau> j416: so reflog shows some "weird meta information" that isn't part of the git project per se, but something related only to my local clone of the project repository.  That's why I assumed it might also show info of dates

[23:08:34] <imMute> so I have a branch that was mistakenly merged to master.  that merge was then reverted.  when I try to rebase on top of the latest trunk, some of the commits get dropped (because git thinks they were merged already).  is there a way to force it to keep the commits?
[23:08:36] <henk> hi, IIRC there is a way to edit a commit with the changed files unstaged but can’t figure out what it was. Does anyone know what I mean? I want to split the last commit in two basically and don’t want to manually undo the edits …
[23:09:43] <imMute> henk: I use git-gui to do the amend.  there's a CLI way to do it, but I find the GUI easier (for once)

[23:13:03] <henk> imMute: thanks, I’ll remember that and try it but in this case I’m using git via ssh, so no gui ):

[23:14:16] <DoofusCanadensis> probably means, ssh into the server where git is being run locally

[23:15:17] <gitinfo> lantech19446: Git is not a deployment tool, but you can build one around it (in simple environments) or use it as an object store(for complex ones). Here are some options/ideas to get you started: http://gitolite.com/deploy.html
[23:16:09] <henk> imMute: hehe, yeah, sure, it’s not a big problem but I’d rather not install anything X-related on this machine.

[23:16:38] <lantech19446> I use it mostly to have a backup of my site files it works quite well and makes it restorable anywhere quickly
[23:17:37] <imMute> henk: fair enough.  I found installing the small client X libraries was worth it (it's much less than a full desktop environment or window manager)
