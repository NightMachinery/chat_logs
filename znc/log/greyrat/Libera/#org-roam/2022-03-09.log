[18:02:17] <AadVersteden[m]> Edmund: I don't understand what shifted.  This is in sync with the IRC room?
[18:03:13] *** Joins: madnificent (~madnifice@static.210.74.63.178.clients.your-server.de)
[18:03:55] <madnificent> Ah, looks like it is :D
[19:24:13] <Edmund[m]> Aad Versteden: Exactly, I didn't notice there was a libera chat room when I make the matrix space. This is just pointed to that, so I think it's bridged?
[19:24:51] <Edmund[m]> Regardless, again trying to further unify the chats, not continue to fragment them, so I think this is the move.
[22:12:37] <madnificent> It is!
[22:12:45] <madnificent> And I love the move!
[22:19:34] <AadVersteden[m]> <madnificent> "And I love the move!" <- Seconded! ðŸ™ˆ
[22:19:41] <AadVersteden[m]> enough jokes
