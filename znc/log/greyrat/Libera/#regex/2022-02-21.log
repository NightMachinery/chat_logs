[00:02:35] <mysticspiral[m]> basically if there are any chars in the target string present that are not in the character class you run into problems

[00:17:07] <re101-walrus-89> Why the non-capturing group on <LINK_TEXT text=\\" and no non-capturing group on \\">   ?
[00:17:51] <mysticspiral[m]> the first is to enclose the alternation

[00:18:01] <mysticspiral[m]> <LINK_TEXT text=\"
[00:18:05] <mysticspiral[m]> and
[00:18:06] <mysticspiral[m]> \G
[00:18:22] <mysticspiral[m]> second is a lookahead
[00:18:53] <mysticspiral[m]> it make sure we are not beyond \\">
[00:19:33] <re101-walrus-89> interesting
[00:20:11] <mysticspiral[m]> we will never get beyond it with [a-z0-9] though

[07:51:43] <coin_guy> Hi everyone, I'm trying to identify coin year and mint locations in eBay titles (e.g. 1982-O for 1982 New Orleans, 1876CC for 1876 Carson City), and I'm having an issue with the "CC" Carson City ones since it is only seeing the first "C." How can I get it to "prefer" the "CC" over a single "C" if "CC" is present? Thank you.

[17:47:44] <rapha> hi all!
[17:48:37] <rapha> is it possible to get _no_ match in the group called "pr" by _only_ modifying the insides of the group called "cm"? https://regex101.com/r/RjLr89/1
[17:49:46] <rapha> or alternatively to modify "pr" in a way that it doesn't "steal away" the last number but would still eat up until the end of the string if there was more?

[23:02:04] <VectorX> thevolle if you have created an example https://regex101.com/ that would help
[23:02:17] <VectorX> and you can explain what you need to achive
[23:02:47] <VectorX> might even be better if you can explain what you are trying to do in plain english, ie your scenario
[23:03:08] <thevolle> Yes. I will
[23:03:15] <thevolle> Give me a few seconds to prepare
[23:03:29] <VectorX> what ever do do not paste multiple lines here at once, it will add a temp ban on your nick
[23:03:56] <thevolle> I have a name, exampel John Doe <SMTP:john.doe@subdomain.domain.com>
[23:04:35] <thevolle> I used this (?<=:).*(?=>) regex and it gets me the mailaddress
[23:04:58] <thevolle> But I wish to get the plain name and match the mail address
[23:05:01] <VectorX> do you have a https://regex101.com/ example
[23:05:21] <thevolle> Yes
[23:05:35] <thevolle> https://regex101.com/r/jbHAWd/1
[23:06:50] <VectorX> how are you doing this, ie in a language or some program?
[23:07:46] <thevolle> in PowerShell . it has a regex function
[23:08:10] <thevolle> the regex I've shown works in PowerShell
[23:08:52] <VectorX> well, I think you can use groups so something like https://regex101.com/r/jbHAWd/2
[23:09:07] <VectorX> https://mcpmag.com/articles/2015/09/30/regex-groups-with-powershell.aspx
[23:10:41] <thevolle> I appreciate the help. Tho the example you provided returns it with 3 matches.
[23:11:08] <thevolle> I wish to keep the mailaddress and the normal name of John Doe
[23:11:43] <VectorX> right you will need to make multiple matches to get that
[23:11:59] <VectorX> so you can put a group around everything to get the mail address itself
[23:12:11] <VectorX> https://regex101.com/r/jbHAWd/3
[23:12:28] <VectorX> so the 1st group is the mail address, second the name, third the domain
[23:13:12] <VectorX> you have to get some sort of structure anyway to make the seperation, if not you have to get the mail address and further process in powershell
[23:14:22] <thevolle> Sorry I was not clear enough, if I can demonstrate simply what sort of output I wish (John Doe) (john.doe@subdomain.domain.com)
[23:15:02] <VectorX> that does not make any sense since what is john.doe was batman or Axe
[23:15:15] <VectorX> or dirtygirl@subdomain.domain.com
[23:16:05] <thevolle> It's simply an example
[23:16:08] <VectorX> you can ofcourse match anything with a . and tranform to an extent but mileage is limited
[23:16:22] <thevolle> Mhh. Thank you for helping.
[23:16:24] <VectorX> right and my example was were your example would break
[23:16:47] *** Quits: mickey8 (~user@user/mickey) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[23:16:55] <VectorX> john.a.doe@subdomain.domain.com
[23:17:07] *** Joins: mickey8 (~user@user/mickey)
[23:17:12] <VectorX> did you want John A Doe from that
[23:17:34] <VectorX> you now have to build a program with a set of rules
[23:17:41] <thevolle> I wish to have John Doe and the mailaddress without <SMTP and >
[23:18:02] <VectorX> you cant match parts in text unless you use groups
[23:18:33] <VectorX> so the first match will be the entire thing, which I why I provided a link of how to use the groups in PS
[23:19:16] <thevolle> yes
[23:32:19] <thevolle> Thank you for taking time. I figured out how to make what I want based around your examples.
