[00:02:30] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> hello, I started flailing with nim today and I'm afraid I might have some very noobish questions if you don't mind. My first confusion is about passing arrays efficiently to a procedure by reference

[00:05:29] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> what would be the sane way to achieve this? I'm concerned about the "var" keyword there, I suspect I might be doing a deep copy here
[00:05:59] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> also I would like to get rid of that uint8 cast somehow, and replace it with the actual type from the template
[00:07:06] <FromDiscord> <dom96> 'var' won't make a deep copy
[00:07:15] <FromDiscord> <dom96> but you can check the generated C sources if you'd like to make sure

[00:14:45] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> is there an easy way to do that?
[00:15:15] <FromDiscord> <auxym> compile with `--nimcache:nimcache`, the generated C sources will be in ./nimcache
[00:16:05] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> I see
[00:20:27] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @elmaco but yeah, in your case it would never generate a deep copy  since you're using `var`
[00:20:48] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> `var Type` in argument list means that you want to pass the argument by reference so you can modify the original one
[00:21:07] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> and about uint8 thing -  first of all, in Nim that's a type-safe conversion and not a cast, and what do you mean "from the template"?
[00:21:18] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> you want it to automatically convert to whatever type Canvas has?
[00:21:27] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> yes
[00:24:37] <FromDiscord> <auxym> Then you'll probably want to make `Noise` generic with a similar def as your `Canvas`
[00:25:08] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> Noise  is already generic
[00:25:12] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> it's an implicit generic
[00:25:47] <FromDiscord> <auxym> But if you need to extract the `T` integer type, wouldn't you need to make it explicitly generic?
[00:26:02] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> not neccesarily
[00:26:03] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> watch this

[00:28:29] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> fwiw, it works with `Canvas.T` too (as in that example above):
[00:28:30] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> that seems to work üëç
[00:28:35] <FromDiscord> <auxym> Btw, proc params are never copied, whether they are `var` or not, right? Unless there's an assignment or something like that in the proc body, obviously

[00:29:05] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> I'm looking at the C code for the Noise procedure, and I have to say it looks kinda scary
[00:29:11] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> it's totally fine
[00:29:19] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> also, the debug C code has a lot of cruft
[00:29:24] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> try with -d:danger --gc:arc --panics:on
[00:29:32] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @auxym nim optimizes big projects to pass them by-reference but they will still act as value types
[00:29:38] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> there's lots of memsets and memcmp's in there
[00:29:41] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> but generally value types are passed by value, so they are copied (if they're under 24 bytes)
[00:29:59] <FromDiscord> <auxym> In reply to @Yardanico "<@!882793909246369864> nim optimizes big": Yes that was my impression.
[00:29:59] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> (edit) "memcmp's" => "memcpy's"
[00:30:09] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> if you pass an int to a proc, it'll get copied

[00:31:16] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @elmaco if you're on latest nim, it's generally better to use --gc:orc (that's the future default Nim GC)
[00:31:36] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> --gc:arc  is just refcounting with move semantics and stuff like destructors, ORC is arc + cycle collector
[00:32:19] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> so generally you can just use --gc:orc if you don't know if your program has cycles or not, ORC has a very low overhead over ARC when you don't have cycle types at all
[00:33:19] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> I intend to run some kind of benchmark against my c++ codes, but only when I have at least a rudimentary idea of what I'm doing. So far I quite like the language, especially the clean syntax is nice and ``{.experimental: "codeReordering".}`` is something I've wanted for a long time
[00:33:51] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> well, if we get lazy semchecking, then codeReordering will be history
[00:34:05] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> and of course codeReordering doesn't help when you have mutually recursive procedures
[00:34:27] <FromDiscord> <el__maco> what does lazy semchecking mean. I hope you don

[00:35:41] <FromDiscord> <auxym> Yeah, lazy semcheck would be we could lose forward declares, and get circular imports

[06:21:38] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `cstring` is a `char` string is a pointer with size and capacity
[06:21:59] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> guess i should say `ptr char` instead of `char`
[06:22:18] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Also writing to the zip file like that probably will not work
[06:22:30] <User11> OK it takes me a while to type this out but you seems to know where the problem is

[06:27:21] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> casting `cstring` to `string` is just wrong, they're not the same data so bad things will happen
[06:27:52] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `cast` in nim isnt a type conversion it's a type reinterpretation, which means the data stays the same but the type system says "It's now X"
[06:28:15] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `buffer.string` is probably what you want, but there is a `&=` for `string &= cstring`
[06:29:35] <User11> Yes this brings me to this issue https://github.com/Araq/libcurl/issues/4
[06:30:55] <User11> That is why I switched to string concatenation with a range parameter
[06:32:01] <User11> How could I do the same with cstring ? To concat a cstring into a string variable?
[06:33:05] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3AM4 probably the most sound method
[06:33:18] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Idk if `size` is the size of the buffer or if `count` is
[06:34:29] <User11> aha that makes more sense
[06:35:50] <User11> the size is the size of 1 unit of data, and the count is how many, I think
[06:36:20] <User11> so the real size is "size * count"
[06:36:23] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> ah then replace size with `size  count` where i used size of course

[19:22:54] <FromDiscord> <Rika> okay
[19:22:58] <FromDiscord> <Rika> it does mean add one but it's not well defined on floats
[19:23:07] <FromDiscord> <Goel> I can understand that inc() needs ordinal type and n is float. I can accept it. But why i can do n += 1? 1 is not cosidered int in this case? I though i had to do n += 1.0
[19:23:18] <FromDiscord> <Rika> rather not all floats would return a different value when you add one
[19:23:49] <FromDiscord> <Rika> `1` is a literal and can be coerced into a float
[19:24:50] <krux02> Goel, if you remove `inc` from your knowledge and your codebase, you won't miss anything.
[19:25:31] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Yeah I just avoid `inc`
[19:25:38] <nrds> <06Prestige99> seems odd to me

[19:26:20] <FromDiscord> <Goel> Really? Actually i've been using += for long time, then reading some code i read a lot of inc() and i though was a good idea as of style to change into it...
[19:26:48] <krux02> I've been on both sides
[19:26:56] <krux02> you can safely ignore inc

[19:27:15] <FromDiscord> <Rika> yes it can be ignored, it's just another +=
[19:27:31] <krux02> but it is also not bad to have just inc instead of `+=`, you should just pick one and ignore the other

[22:50:50] <FromDiscord> <treeform> I had speed success in passing  using `var string` even when I am not modifying it.
[22:51:31] <FromDiscord> <treeform> I used `hottie` to see that there was a ton of string copying
[22:51:44] <FromDiscord> <treeform> nim could figure out that I don't mutate the string
[22:51:54] <FromDiscord> <treeform> so it just made everything var string which made mutation ok
[22:52:02] <FromDiscord> <treeform> and it just passed stuff without string copies
[22:52:10] <FromDiscord> <treeform> even though no mutation where there
[22:52:47] <FromDiscord> <treeform> this var string made a difference: https://github.com/treeform/globby/blob/master/src/globby.nim#L34
[22:53:01] <FromDiscord> <treeform> I `hottie` and `bency` it and it was good.
[22:56:51] <FromDiscord> <Hamid Bluri> In reply to @treeform "I `hottie` and `bency`": ben[ch]y you mean?
[22:57:03] <FromDiscord> <treeform> sorry yes

[23:41:43] <FromDiscord> <iffy (Matt Haggard)> hmmm, why does `nimble install hottie` not work?
[23:49:45] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> What does it error with?
[23:51:24] <FromDiscord> <iffy (Matt Haggard)> "     Error\: Package not found."
[23:51:43] <FromDiscord> <iffy (Matt Haggard)> Is it because I'm on macOS and hottie isn't supported for macOS?
[23:51:49] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Seems like your nimble package list isnt upgrading
