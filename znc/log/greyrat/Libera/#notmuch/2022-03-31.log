[11:51:50] <jani> bremner: I haven't used the patches in years. maybe I've gotten a beefier machine since then. but still, I very rarely look beyond the first page of results for any search. even for "inbox searches" I usually end up redoing the search before I've reached the end of the page
[11:53:12] <jani> I have about 60 lines in the window, so for me that would be enough
[11:54:03] <jani> limiting the search by time is different, it also impacts the messages in the threads that match. in case you have threads with recent and old messages mixed
