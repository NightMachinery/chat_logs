[03:05:58] <JibStyle> Hi, any recommendations on how to symmetric encrypt a 4GB directory containing thousands of PDF files? It seems GPG operates mostly on individual files, but I see there is a gpgtar program as well.
[03:07:13] <JibStyle> I guess I'm wondering if gpgtar is a common solution for this, and if it can handle a 4GB directory.

[03:30:53] *** Quits: gast0n (~g4570n@user/gast0n) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[03:32:34] <demure> JibStyle: have you looked at any of the encryption filesystem options?
[03:32:40] <demure> (non gpg)
[03:32:54] <demure> https://www.tecmint.com/file-and-disk-encryption-tools-for-linux/
[03:38:02] <JibStyle> Thanks for the link. I am considering VeraCrypt as an alternative to GPG. I need something cross platform (definitely Windows and Mac, and iOS would be nice to have). The reason I find GPG attractive is that I plan to access the files mostly via Emacs and it has good GPG integration.
[03:40:11] <rk4> so you want to be able to occasionally access a single PDF from a 4GB encrypted archieve, cross platform?
[03:41:18] <rk4> is there a single copy of the archive on the network? or would you copy it to each device?
[03:43:48] *** Quits: georgios (~georgios@user/georgios) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[03:45:05] <JibStyle> Yes, occasionally access single PDF. Copy it to each device (still figuring out how to do this part, as well).
[03:45:25] <rk4> i expect you should be fine with a 4gb tar file encrypted with gpg, personally i'd split it up into a few sections because 4gb of decrypting to get 1 pdf is a pita
[03:45:54] <rk4> are the filenames sensitive?
[03:46:00] <JibStyle> Yeah, that makes sense.
[03:46:15] <rk4> most userfriendly would be to encrypt each pdf individually imho
[03:46:16] <JibStyle> No, filenames mostly not sensitive.
[03:47:15] <JibStyle> Splitting into a few sections may be a good middle ground.
[03:47:40] <rk4> beware 4GB is around the limit of some [formerly?] common file systems so might be worth avoiding anyway
[03:48:22] <JibStyle> True, another point in favor of smaller files/archives.
[03:49:54] <JibStyle> If there are many individually encrypted files, I'm considering Git+GitHub for keeping them in sync, as I may find the git history useful. Then I could get rid of Dropbox altogether.
[03:51:01] <rk4> presume you've heard of syncthing? :>
[03:51:03] <JibStyle> Of course file/archive sizes would have to be small enough for git to perform well.
[03:51:11] <JibStyle> I've heard of it but never used it.
[03:51:26] <JibStyle> I'm advanced/expert with git though.
[03:51:44] <JibStyle> What advantage would syncthing have over git+GitHub?
[03:52:23] <rk4> syncthing is about syncing files between computers without cloud storage. different apps, different intentions
[03:52:49] <rk4> personally if i had anything i felt like encrypting i would not be putting the ciphertext on github
[03:53:29] <JibStyle> I see. I want to keep a cloud backup though, in case of the rare event that my house may explode.
[03:53:34] <rk4> if one makes a mistake and uploads it to a cloud, now it's there forever :<
[03:53:58] <rk4> ah
[03:54:50] <JibStyle> The github repo would be private, so I assume it should be safe enough.
[03:55:04] <JibStyle> ie as safe as Dropbox
[03:55:19] <rk4> hehe, yeah probably as safe as dropbox or facebook or google
[03:55:38] <JibStyle> Previously, I had a MacOS encrypted volume saved in Dropbox, but I want to move away from that as it is not multi platform.
[03:56:57] <rk4> a regular checkout of this git repo is going to use 8gb, not sure what the ios git clients are like in terms of doing less usual things
[03:57:37] <JibStyle> Yeah, but that should be a one-time cost (assuming individually encrypted files).
[03:57:58] <rk4> might be fine, i guess if you like git give it a go :>
[03:59:00] <JibStyle> I think I'll try and see how it goes. Thanks for the help.
