[00:51:07] <Khepra> Aarch64debian: haxxing aside, your question makes no sense. when you say "grab a link" you must specify a protocol. There is no one protocol, there's many.
[00:51:50] <Khepra> and even if you could, say, avoid http by using, say, ftp, there's no guarantee the speed limits aren't enforced lower on teh OSI stack, which means whichever protocol you use, you'd be in the same situation
[00:52:34] <Khepra> and any attempt at haxxing _remotely_ can only be done by (ab)using some specific protocol. so even if this were #haxxors_r_us, your question still makes no sense.

[04:13:38] <Wally> but we don't have AMD graphics on ARM at all :D
[04:13:41] <somiaj> firmware-linux is a non-free metapackage that seems to depend on all the different linux firmware.
[04:13:51] <Wally> It should be independant IMO
[04:14:10] <somiaj> Why? The point of that package is to pull in all firmware, and removing that packgae has no effect on your system.
[04:14:27] <Wally> if you remove the package it removes the other stuff
[04:14:39] <Wally> Which is why I was curious :)
[04:14:48] <somiaj> Just mark the other stuff you want as manual isntall
[04:15:25] <somiaj> Which install method did you use? firmware-linux isn't really a default package that is installed, though it may come with the non-free firmware installer, and that installer needs all firmware because it won't know which firmware is needed

[04:18:08] <Wally> So I guess individual firmware items can be installed without hassle. Neat.
[04:18:10] <somiaj> firmware-linux-nonfree is just a metapackage, you can choose to install just the packages with the firmware you need (note, outside of extra disk space (which isn't to much anyways) having extra firmware installed won't have any other effect if it isn't needed
[04:18:44] <Wally> yeah that's all the concern is here, disk space.. 50MB on a 32GB Partition isn't terrible but I guess that's a lot of documents

[04:23:44] <somiaj> it depends on what you mean by firmware-linux, really it is just enough info to pull in other packages, there is no actual firmware in it

[10:52:23] <jmcnaught> Why log into ssh as root in the first place?  Log into ssh as regular user, use "su -" or "sudo" to become root when necessary
[10:52:39] <jmcnaught> !buster su
[10:52:39] <dpkg> Starting with buster, su no longer overrides PATH by default, requiring that you use "su -" or "su -l" for login shells (which is not really a new thing at all...). See https://wiki.debian.org/NewInBuster#Changes for details.

[11:16:36] <pingpongball> I'm rooting my android
[11:16:49] <labrador> Snapdragon processor>
[11:16:52] <labrador> *?
[11:17:40] <pingpongball> where can i find it?
[11:17:50] <pingpongball> it is old android
[11:17:57] <pingpongball> not old but crappy
[11:18:12] <pingpongball> it have installed fb by default, and i cant remove it
[11:18:18] <labrador> Okay see

[11:18:34] <pingpongball> :/  really
[11:18:39] <labrador> But to do what you want you do not need root

[11:22:46] <labrador> If its not though,you can still remove bloatware through adb
[11:23:08] <labrador> If OS is fine,then use adb to remove packages that you hate
[11:23:13] <pingpongball> aumm ok i'll buy new librem in future, but for this prorpietary i'll remove bloatware
[11:23:23] <labrador> Nice
[11:24:11] <pingpongball> I've got a tutorial  to do so https://www.xda-developers.com/uninstall-carrier-oem-bloatware-without-root-access/
[11:24:12] <pingpongball> :)
[11:24:22] <pingpongball> without root cool
[11:24:44] <labrador> And its not bad,I have samsung too. All my main applications are free software,along with my launcher.
[11:24:54] <labrador> With removed bloatware too
[11:25:38] <labrador> But that tutorial is the bad one,do not pm uninstall -k use pm disable --user 0
[11:25:58] <pingpongball> oh
[11:26:02] <pingpongball> tell me how
[11:26:10] <pingpongball> i've gone to shell
[11:26:13] <labrador> Because once you uninstall you need to factory reset to get a package back
[11:26:24] <labrador> Disabling wrong packages can be reversed
[11:27:04] <pingpongball> what should i do?
[11:27:44] <labrador> Yea I am going to shell too,I did it a little while ago too.
[11:27:49] <labrador> Wait a minute
[11:27:58] <pingpongball> :)
[11:30:37] <labrador> Ok yea,you need to know the name of the application you want by pm list packaes

[12:03:33] <bob_x2> or I did not chooce correct package during installation ?
[12:03:38] <bob_x2> interesting
[12:03:49] <at0m> labrador: way offtopic here, but heimdall works great for me on the devices that it supports. like any hw one plans on using with free software, it's pivotal to research before buying. I've had great experience w Samsung's S-series, for example.
[12:04:12] <at0m> bob_x2: wired or wireless? /etc/network/interfaces still works like before
[12:04:45] <at0m> then there's ip and iw and the bunch
[12:06:06] <bob_x2> yes ip is there
[12:06:16] <bob_x2> so I have to craft a network interface configuration by hands then
[12:06:31] <bob_x2> where is the correct documentation point about how these files works ?
[12:06:33] <at0m> that's 2-3 lines, that's easy no?
[12:07:10] <at0m> https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkConfiguration
[12:07:30] <bob_x2> yes 2-3lines is easy
[12:07:31] <at0m> or just 'man interfaces'
[12:08:02] <bob_x2> man command not found )
[12:08:06] <bob_x2> will read web now
[12:08:59] <labrador> at0m yeah it does work fine with its supported devices,but most did not know about samsung's fastboot problem until they bought one. Then its upto chance wether you bought one supported by heimdall or not.
[12:11:24] <at0m> yea. research before buying =)

[17:07:03] <Khepra> Aarch64debian: on linux, meanwhile, you can use qemu-img to convert virtualization disk formats, and iirc it does understand virtualbox's. to "mount" it you can use qemu nbd facilities.

[19:16:41] <Khepra> Aarch64debian: no you said you wanted to remove packages
[19:16:49] <Khepra> if you want to UNHOLD them then that's apt-mark unhold
[19:17:13] <Aarch64debian> bad phraseing maybe
[19:17:37] <Khepra> very much so if removing packages wasn't what you wanted, in which case apt-mark remove is NOT what you want
[19:17:50] <Aarch64debian> apt-mark showhold | xargs ..
[19:18:10] <Khepra> the .. is very important, depending what you want

[19:25:47] <Khepra> ie you haven't removed them yet, and they've changed state from "ii" to "ri"
[19:25:52] <Aarch64debian> you told me to apt remove -s, it showed a long msg idk what it is, then i saw its apt remove..
[19:26:35] <Khepra> Aarch64debian: you're not making much sense :)
[19:26:47] <Khepra> do you wasnt the HELD packages UNINSTALLED ?
[19:26:52] <Khepra> *want
[19:27:38] <Aarch64debian> no i want to remove from hold list to upgrade
[19:27:57] <Khepra> Aarch64debian: then neither apt-get remove, nor apt-mark remove is what you want.
[19:28:03] <Khepra> you want apt-mark unhold
[19:29:01] *** fling is now known as bedroller
[19:29:02] <Khepra> and if you used apt-mark remove  on them, you've now got a semi-broken state. I _think_ you can revert the damage by     apt-mark showremove | xargs apt-mark install    ....  assuming you want them back int he "ii" state

[19:31:00] <Khepra> or not... don't blindly run that command... see the list first with    apt-mark showremove ...... fuck debian package management is so convoluted and retarded
[19:32:49] *** Joins: hackers (~self@user/hackers)
[19:33:30] <Khepra> so the deal is... you have "ri" packages that you might want back into "ii" state, but showremove will also show "rc" and other "r*" things meaning you can't use this list to blindly mark installed.
[19:33:50] <Khepra> no idea how to fix this other than hacking around dpkg -l | grep "^ri "

[19:45:37] <node1> Hello
[19:46:03] <node1> How to install php7.0-mysql on debian buster?
[19:47:22] <Aarch64debian> these packages are not marked installed by dpkgg but indeed installed you mean?
[19:48:11] <Aarch64debian> ,v mysql
[19:48:12] <judd> No package named 'mysql' was found in amd64.
[19:48:24] <Aarch64debian> ,v sql
[19:48:25] <judd> No package named 'sql' was found in amd64.
[19:48:27] <Khepra> node1: why would you want that? buster's PHP is 7.3, and if you used something like sury's repo to get 7.0, then that's how you get the 7.0 packages . php 7.0 is long dead, unsuported, unpatched, tho
[19:48:54] <Khepra> Aarch64debian: that's the problem with deb package management. there's current state and "desired" state
[19:49:10] <Khepra> apt-mark only _marks_ packages, ie. changes the desired state
