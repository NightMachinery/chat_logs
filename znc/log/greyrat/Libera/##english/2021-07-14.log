[00:01:57] <LuisM14> an AmE fact ¯\_(o.o)_/¯
[00:02:19] <rak> As a Canadian, I'm with bin. I'll say freezer if I specifically mean the freezer section, and fridge to mean the whole fridge + freezer unit.
[00:03:17] <rak> So, e.g., "Is there any ice left in the freezer?" but "I need to buy a new fridge", or "that's an ugly fridge".
[00:04:27] <TechTest> I also thought "fridge" reffirs to the entire device
[00:04:51] <TechTest> though I advise against discussing fridge/freezers with blkshp

[02:57:25] <LuisM18> adverbs are unrestrained
[03:02:58] <ksft> I think it's confusing because "locked" has two very similar meanings
[03:03:25] <ksft> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/locked
[03:03:54] <ksft> it can be either a participle of the verb "lock" or an adjective on its own meaning "secured by a lock"
[03:04:42] <ksft> it's a little bit unusual to use "is" with a past participle in English, so "is locked" suggests the second meaning
[03:04:56] <LuisM18> yea
[03:05:23] <ksft> but "was locked" is ambiguous
[03:06:09] <ksft> "the door was locked" could mean "the door was in the state where the lock was engaged" or "someone locked the door"
[03:07:05] <LuisM18> by me :x
[03:07:09] *** Quits: GuiToris (~GuiToris@user/guitoris) (Quit: Sieben Acht Gute Nacht!)
[03:07:29] <ksft> on its own, that passive construction feels slightly unnatural to me (I would probably say "someone locked the door" or something similar), so I would again probably read it as the non-participle meaning
[03:07:33] <LuisM18> welp, gone out the door
[03:07:55] <ksft> but context could change that
[03:08:25] <LuisM18> it indeed was locked by me :x
[03:08:36] <LuisM18> anyway, he's gone

[04:19:15] <Losher> darsie: Oops. It's a sentence.
[04:26:24] <kurahaupo> I wonder how many languages have (at least in their etymologies) the generalisation from "fabric" (textile) to "fabricate" (make anything)
[04:27:11] <kurahaupo> Or "apple" as a stand-in for "any kind of fruit"
[04:29:06] <Losher> All the Latin based ones are a good bet for fabric/fabricate. My dialect does not allow apple as a general stand-in for fruit.
[04:30:34] <LjL> kurahaupo, do you think it's a generalization from the textile-related meaning? we say it, not as often as in english, but in "fabbricare accuse" for example (fabricate, make up charges against someone), and in italian the root word "fabbrica" doesn't have anything to do with textiles
[04:31:39] <LjL> kurahaupo, i note "fabricate" has "manufacture" as a synonym... yes, obviously more general, but i'm reminded of how i believe "manufactured x" is also sometimes used to mean artificial, made-up x, such as "manufactured accusation"
[04:32:55] *** Quits: tempfile (~tempfile@user/tempfile) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[04:33:05] <Losher> LjL: OED just says "French fabrique (= Provençal fabriga , Italian fabbrica , Spanish fábrica ), < Latin fabrica , < faber worker in metal, stone, wood, etc." - A product of skilled workmanship. An edifice, or a building.
[04:33:51] <LjL> Losher, that's about fabric... what does it say about fabricate?
[04:34:29] <LjL> i mean, in line of principle it's entirely possible that the "make up" meaning of "fabricate" (as opposed to its other, currently less used, meanings) comes from the textile-related meaning of "fabric"
[04:34:35] <LjL> i just don't find it very likely
[04:35:35] <Losher> Much what you'd expect: fabricate - Etymology: < Latin fabricāt- participial stem of fabricāre , < fabrica fabric n. It's also an obsolete Scottish adjective.

[18:44:40] <LuisP14> :)
[18:45:24] <xerxes> i think upto some limit one can use words, but above that numerals are preferred. i was just wondering what the limit is.
[18:45:45] <xerxes> ten?
[18:45:46] <Babar> it's not a rule, just a style preference
[18:45:55] <Kartagis> I bet my money on ten

[18:47:54] <xerxes> but i guess words are preferred in sensitive situations like cheques, etc.

[18:48:34] <xerxes> pussipupu: why did you say "nineteen"? i missed the messages before.
[18:48:54] <pussipupu> because I think a less common one is up to nineteen in words
[18:49:22] <pussipupu> Ten and lower as words is probably the closest to a standard though
[18:49:28] <xerxes> pussipupu: it could be. it's not a strictly observed convention, that's clear.
[18:49:56] <xerxes> pussipupu: 19 as a number is also used in some religious and mystical numerology. :P

[23:12:00] <blkshp> It holds books.
[23:12:11] <Buck> I would say hold, too
[23:12:25] <Buck> but I'm having a discussion and am wondering if container is technically also correct

[23:28:22] <bin> I would say that a bookshelf does contain books
[23:28:36] <bin> especially a 3-sided bookshelf
[23:29:31] <bin> a container is an object that is used to hold or transport something, so a bookshelf is definitely a container
[23:29:51] <bin> so by extension it contains books, QED
[23:30:08] <blkshp> definitely, I think it's debatable.
[23:30:09] <ksft> can you give an example of a container that transports but does not hold something?
[23:30:40] <bin> It's not xor
[23:31:22] <bin> In order to transport things it has to hold them, obviously.
[23:31:34] <ksft> then why are the words "or transport" in that definition?
[23:31:39] <ksft> also, I'm not sure that's true
[23:31:58] <ksft> well, maybe it is, depending on what exactly you mean by "hold"
[23:32:40] <bin> okay if it's not true then you're welcome to give an example.
