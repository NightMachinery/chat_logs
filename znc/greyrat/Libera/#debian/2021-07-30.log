[00:43:09] <greycat> It redirects the standard error stream, which is where errors *should* be sent.
[00:43:38] <greycat> Individual programs may be broken, and may be sending errors to the standard output stream instead, or may be sending ordinary output to stderr, who knows.
[00:44:32] <dob1> ok so if I want to "mute" a program, redirect all the output to /dev/null is just > , right?

[11:08:16] <Khepra> punkgeek: another option... If that dprintf() is following the rules of kprint verbosity settings, it might be possible to shush all that by somehow setting the kernel.printk sysctl early in initramfs; maybe that's even something to be passed via cmdline
[11:08:26] <Khepra> %s/kprint/printk/

[12:58:17] <Lope> Hey guys, I'm currently running windows VM's on ZFS mirror Zvol's (formatted as NTFS)... I'm using ZFS underneath to ensure data integrity.
[12:58:25] <Lope> But I'd like to be able to do live migration
[12:58:39] <Lope> But I don't want to lose the assurance of integrity.
[12:59:11] <Lope> And I only want to store the disks in one place. (I don't want to run 3 extra servers running Ceph or whatever)

[13:00:22] <Lope> So I had an idea to rather make a normal ZFS filesystem (for normal files) then run NFS ontop of that ZFS filesystem. (which I've done... and it works)
[13:01:12] <Lope> Then store a RAW disk image on that NFS which is on the ZFS filesystem. Format that raw disk image as NTFS etc. And then I can do live migrations.
[13:01:40] <Lope> Basically I want to run VM's from my NAS, with more than 1 hypervisor, and live migrate between them.
[13:02:14] <Lope> Logically I don't see any hurdles with doing this.

[17:37:01] <udaba> How i should back up my system? im super noob.
[17:37:06] <Lope> I find that if you've got some weird apt hacks going on you're much more likely to have a problem.
[17:37:20] <udaba> also i tried to upgrade , but something broke
[17:37:23] <udaba> nvidia drivers i think
[17:37:33] <Lope> udaba, get an external SSD or HDD or rent a remote server you can backup onto.
[17:37:38] <udaba> when i restarted after upgrade i booted at black screen
[17:37:48] <udaba> Thats fine i meant to backup my OS .
[17:37:49] <Lope> yeah, you might want to uninstall nvidia drivers before you upgrade. Much safer to do that.
[17:38:03] <udaba> cause i dont want to lose my settings i done to debian right now
[17:38:06] <udaba> is this safe?
[17:38:13] <udaba> one man at debian forum reccomend me that
[17:38:16] <Lope> the debian upgrade process is safe if it's only standard debian stuff.
[17:38:29] <Lope> but if you have done any fuckery with apt or any weird drivers etc, then all bets are off.

[17:40:32] <Khepra> hold on. why would nvidia drivers break? if you installed them from regular debian apt sources, even backported, then the upgrade path should be direct
[17:40:37] <Lope> just make sure you uninstall it the recommended way

[17:41:05] <Lope> I'm not sure what is the recommended way to remove the nvidia drivers
[17:41:05] <Khepra> udaba: did you install the driver outside of package manager?
[17:41:12] <Lope> but you have a linux live USB right?
[17:41:18] <Khepra> `apt remove` is recommended way to remove packages from debian
[17:41:29] <Lope> just ensure you have a bootable linux USB so you can fix your system if it bricks
[17:41:29] <udaba> Oh ok :)

[17:45:02] <Khepra> I'd be very interested in learning how exactly that nvidia upgrade failed, because if it's using regular pacakges, it should not fail, and failure might indicate a problem somewhere else.
[17:45:35] <PMT> Also, if it failed, where are you typing to us from, and asking us how to upgrade, not how to debug a broken upgrade?
[17:46:15] <Khepra> interesting details.
[17:46:26] *** Joins: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth)
[17:47:07] <Lope> udaba, I've got nvidia drivers on one of my systems. I see that the nvidia driver created this file /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-blacklists-nouveau.conf
[17:47:13] <Lope> and that blacklists nouveau
[17:48:06] <Lope> So if you `apt remove --purge nvidia-driver; apt autoremove`, then automagically that file will be deleted. and after you reboot, the open source driver won't be blacklisted.
[17:48:56] <Lope> You could take a chance upgrading with the nvidia driver installed, but I've had issues doing it before. I wouldn't chance it. It's so easy to uninstall and install the nvidia driver. Much easier to do that than to fix a broken upgrade.
[17:50:50] <Lope> the thing is most things kind of work in linux. If you upgrade with nvidia installed, it might kind of work. But I'd rather be safe and do the most straight forward upgrade possible.
[17:51:31] <Lope> there's going to be much less testing that happened with upgrades with an nvidia proprietary driver, than a stock debian install.

[17:54:41] <Khepra> I'd just warn against nouveau. Stretch installation/boot worked fine for my old GTX960. Buster would not boot and I was forced to go multi-user.target and force install the proprietary driver. so, the version of nouveau with buster's initial/release kernel, didn't want to boot.

[18:24:12] <Lope> PMT the new kernel shit is magic
[18:24:19] <Lope> you don't need to setup a loopback device anymore
[18:24:25] <Lope> udaba, coming up:
[18:24:51] <PMT> Lope: sure, you don't need to do losetup, but I don't see any indicator that it'll take anything but a raw image.
[18:25:53] <PMT> (Or rather, it'll take anything you hand it, but treat it like a raw image file.)
[18:25:54] <Lope> mkdir /mnt/my-virtual-ext4; qemu-img create -f qcow2 /mnt/my-ntfs-stuff/vdisk.img 20G; mkfs -t ext4 /mnt/my-ntfs-stuff/vdisk.img; mount /mnt/my-ntfs-stuff/vdisk.img /mnt/my-virtual-ext4; df -h
[18:26:21] <PMT> Lope: ...that just makes a raw image 20G ext4 filesystem, I think.
[18:26:34] <udaba> thats for me Lope?
[18:26:36] <Lope> PMT, oh, that's a good point
[18:26:52] <Lope> PMT, udaba: I'm not sure if the mount command understands qcow2 images.
[18:26:55] <PMT> Like, I think it'll function fine, it's just not what you thought.
[18:27:24] <Lope> PMT: I just tested those commands
[18:27:32] <Lope> but with just a 1M image haha

[18:34:50] <Lope> udaba, what the above will do is make a 20GB file on your ntfs, format that file as ext4, mount it, then show you how much space is on all your mounts
[18:35:02] <Lope> then you can rsync your rootfs into that mountpoint.
[18:35:17] <Lope> take note, forward-slashes are critical with rsync

[18:35:27] <udaba> I have to 1st fix the drives i think.
[18:35:34] <udaba> which is the coomand to see the UUID?
[18:35:58] <Lope> the ; are line separators. you can copy paste that string of commands to a text file and put them one command per line
[18:36:17] <udaba> its too advance for me to do this.

[18:38:00] <PMT> Are they external disks? Are they turned on and connected?
[18:38:32] <udaba> No external.
[18:38:41] <udaba> One HDD and 1 SSD connected with SATA 3.
[18:39:09] <udaba> i remember when i installed i edit a a list for disks so steam would be able to recognize .

[18:41:29] <Lope> forget the qcow2 stuff we mentioned earlier. That's a fancy way to make a disk image that can start small and magically grow etc. But it's more complicated to work with than a raw disk image (which has a fixed size) as per the last paste.
[18:41:42] <Lope> udaba, you need to edit the commands according to your needs
[18:41:53] <udaba> do ihave to create the file?
[18:41:57] <udaba> oh
[18:42:01] <udaba> thats really hard part :P
[18:42:08] <Lope> so /mnt/my-ntfs-stuff/vdisk.img needs to be adjusted so your actual mountpoint where you have free space on your NTFS drive
[18:42:11] <Lope> nah, it's piss easy
[18:42:22] <udaba> the problem is the i cant see my disks
[18:42:26] <udaba> https://imgur.com/a/K4swEEL
[18:42:41] <Lope> maybe instead of /mnt/my-ntfs-stuff/ they might be /media/bob/my-ntfs-ssd/ or whatever.

[19:18:42] <greycat> At this particular moment, if your real goal is to install and run the unstable branch, installing from the release candidate bullseye installer would be a good starting point.  Then "upgrade" to sid from there.
[19:19:22] <greycat> You should note that there will be relatively few differences between bullseye and sid right now, but that will change dramatically in a month.
[19:19:33] <greycat> !slushy
[19:19:33] <dpkg> When a <testing> release becomes frozen, <unstable> tends to partially freeze as well.  This is because developers are reluctant to upload radically new software to unstable, in case the frozen software in testing needs minor updates and to fix release critical bugs which keep testing from becoming <stable>.
[19:19:48] <nuxil> im trying to compile latest gimp. and debian 10 is too old. just becomes messy if i need to install tonz of libs from source.
[19:20:07] <nuxil> so i was told to use sid
[19:20:13] <greycat> what are you going to run it on, after you compile it?
[19:20:27] <nuxil> nothing much 
[19:20:46] <nuxil> xfce or something :p
[19:20:48] <greycat> so the sole objective is to watch it compile, verify that make exited with a zero status, and then remove the source tree?
[19:21:14] <greycat> or are you actually planning to *run* the software?
[19:21:26] <nuxil> well im trying to patch a bug in gimp. 
[19:21:35] <nuxil> a simple bug
[19:22:07] <greycat> if you have a patch for the stable version of gimp, you need to apply it to the stable source tree, not the development branch or the unstable branch or whatever
[19:23:15] <greycat> or... are you a member of the GIMP development team, and trying to debug the current development version of GIMP?
[19:23:16] <nuxil> i dont have the patch yet. i know where the bug is in the code. and i would like to compile latest gimp to see if i can fix it. then submit a patch to the gimp team,
[19:23:45] <greycat> did you observe this bug in the buster version, or on some other operating system's version?
[19:24:20] <nuxil> its a gimp bug with a plugin regarding exporting file formats. no related to any distros at all
[19:24:31] <greycat> which VERSION OF GIMP is the bug in?
[19:24:34] <nuxil> all
[19:24:43] <greycat> ...
[19:25:26] <greycat> if that's really true, then you could patch it in the buster version, and submit that patch, and it'll probably apply cleanly to the devel branch as well.  I seriously doubt you tested EVERY VERSION though.
[19:25:29] <nuxil> bug is simple. its a data loss bug. you have a 16bit image. and it saves it as 8bit. 
[19:26:47] <nuxil> i have talked with some of the foks on the gimp network. they told me to report it, but could not say when it was going to be fixed because too few developers and lot of other things to do.
