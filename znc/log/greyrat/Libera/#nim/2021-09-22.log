[08:11:10] <nrds> <06Prestige99> If you're around @Elegantbeef I got around the compiler issue, but now I'm having an issue where seq[KeyFrame[newAnimationTrack.T]] and seq[KeyFrame[animation.ClosureProc]] aren't compatible. ClosureProc is just a type alias for proc() {.closure.} that I used with your makeEnum macro. Maybe this is a weird bug with generics?
[08:11:41] <nrds> <06Prestige99> newAnimationTrack.T is of type TrackKind, which makeEnum generated

[09:21:44] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> i think the issue is people making game engines instead of games
[09:21:53] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> well yeah
[09:21:54] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> nico only exists and is maintained because it's used to make games
[09:21:59] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it took me like five years to relize that was my issue
[09:22:03] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> (edit) "relize" => "realize"

[09:22:45] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I never would have gotten to that point
[09:23:05] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and I can use that knowledge to build a game instead of a game engine - because at the end of the day my goal isn't to make something that  others can use

[09:23:37] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> like sure you can have my source code (except for my gameplay code / assets)
[09:23:47] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but I'm not going to help you build it or extend it or maintain it
[09:24:11] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> sorry - but there's not enough time in life for that and to achieve my goals
[09:24:52] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but yeah - Nico is rad and if I was good at 2d art I'd probably have just kept working on FRAG / zengine and called it a day
[09:25:10] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> or if I was really good at coming up with concepts for games / game jams like you
[09:25:28] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> instead I have like one big idea for a multiplayer networked RTS game and I'm going to build it, everyone else be damned
[09:25:48] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> mostly because I like strategy games and Araq has been clamoring for a Nim RTS since I joined the community
[09:26:46] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> In reply to @impbox "i think the issue": but I agree - this is the issue
[09:27:09] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> if I could find like one or two other Nim devs who were passionate enough to join me on a networked 3d game project with an advanced renderer - we'd already have a killer game engine
[09:27:33] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it's just like, for me as a person, trying to write all that code (which is going to be heavily reliant on bindings to other libraries since I'm doing 3d, skeletal animation, physics, networking, etc...)
[09:27:49] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> is already enough of a task and teaching someone else to compile it or whatever is even more work

[09:28:45] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> Nim's going to have these little like 2d engines that add a bit of functionality on top of SDL / GLFW  / whatever
[09:29:02] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and then you'll have some other 3d projects that are geared /tailored to a specific project
[09:29:21] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but aren't really  built with the intention of community adoption
[09:29:32] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> at least that's how I've seen things lately (like over the past two or so years)
[09:29:43] <nrds> <06Prestige99> coming up with game ideas has always been the hard part on my end
[09:29:54] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> see the thing is
[09:30:05] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> if you have a environment enough you're comfortable in
[09:30:07] <nrds> <06Prestige99> I like nico but I dislike the whole color palette part of it, I just want to draw graphics
[09:30:11] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> like I imagine @impbox [ftsf] is with Nico
[09:30:18] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> since they built it
[09:30:32] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it's much easier to iterate and ideate and develop a game from ideation to finish
[09:30:39] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> because you know everything about your tech stack from end to end
[09:30:45] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you know the art worklflow, the ins and outs etc
[09:30:49] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> this is the power in building your own tech
[09:31:03] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but any time you use someone else's engine or tech you're going to run into exactly what you just described
[09:31:10] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you want it to work in a certain way that the original author didn't intend
[09:31:44] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> not to mention you'll probably never be as efficient as @impbox [ftsf]  at leveraging the tech, because they wrote it and know its strengths and weaknesses
[09:32:07] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> soooo - don't try to approach the task with the mentality of I need to write a game engine or I need to have the perfect idea for a game
[09:32:12] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> the objective is to limit scope creep
[09:32:28] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> pick a genre - pick a style of game you like and start building the technology you need to make that happen
[09:32:41] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> like for me, with a 3d networked RTS I knew I needed binding to steamworks
[09:33:22] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> because I'm going to leverage steamworks for matchmaking, p2p communicaton, leaderboards, achievements, etc
[09:33:35] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I knew I needed vulkan bindings plus something to make working with vulkan not such a pain - so vk-bootstrap
[09:33:51] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I'm also not a graphics programmer by profession - so I don't know how to implement an abstraction like a frame or render graph, so that' sanother need
[09:33:55] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Given that you're making a 2D tooling prestige just remake retro arcadee games
[09:34:13] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I want a performant engine - so I need some sort of work stealing / fliber based / whatever job system to parallelize work across CPU cores
[09:34:28] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> like these are requirements based on the type of game I want to make - so if I figure out how to do these things I can make that game happen
[09:34:39] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> if your goal is to make 2d games you don't need a godot or a engine or whatever
[09:34:46] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> like you can do it with SDL and probably < 10k LOC
[09:35:06] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but everyone wants to make their own 2d engines, that at the end of the day do the exact same thing just in a slightly different
[09:35:07] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> way
[09:35:12] <nrds> <06Prestige99> @Elegantbeef that's what I've mostly done in the past, like with https://astroships.einheit.tech/
[09:35:12] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> step 1, build a fun 2D single player RTS with rectangles/circles with basic bug AI, once it's fun proceed to step 2, step 2. get it working networked, step 3. make it shiny and look how you want
[09:35:31] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> nico is an exception - I mean it's an attempt at PICO not just some random 2d game engine that can draw tilemaps and handle animated sprites, etc...
[09:35:34] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I disagree
[09:35:45] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> 2d rts != 3d rts
[09:35:50] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> gameplay concepts don't translate
[09:36:05] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> Quick someone make a AoE joke
[09:36:05] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> not to mention - you're completely limited by the art style you just described
[09:36:20] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> RTS's with squares and vanilla mechanics aren't fun or interesting or even worth maki ng
[09:36:23] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> (edit) "maki ng" => "making"

[09:36:52] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it's to make a 3d rts I can sell on steam
[09:37:06] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> that's step 3. make it shiny, add 3d graphics
[09:37:08] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> if I didn't know what I was doing I might agree with you
[09:37:09] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> no
[09:37:17] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you don't just go from 2d to 3d like that
[09:37:24] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and if you think you do - you're wrong
[09:37:28] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> for the most part RTS gameplay is 2D+height
[09:37:32] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> 3d is way more involved and requires upfront planning
[09:37:36] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so does network play
[09:37:37] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> aye, a prototype
[09:37:46] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I can prototype in 3d
[09:37:48] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I want 3d anyway
[09:37:54] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> why should I implement everything in 2d first?
[09:37:57] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> ok, get it done
[09:37:59] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it makes zero sense it' sjust extra work for me
[09:38:01] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I am haha
[09:38:06] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> because it's faster to get done

[09:39:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but it's happening
[09:39:44] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> this is the work on the vulkan renderer and atm the render graph impl is being  wrapped

[09:42:09] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so - taking a project from start to finish for me is extremely difficult - you should have seen my life prior to me getting on my meds
[09:42:12] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> or med I should say
[09:42:27] <nrds> <06Prestige99> how did you realize you have it?

[09:42:46] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I struggled with substance abuse and mental health misdiagnoseses for two plus decades
[09:43:05] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> eventually a therapist I had seen before was like - describe your day to day life for me and posited that maybe I had some kind of attention disorder
[09:43:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> went to a shrink and got diagnosed and put on adderall - it helped but after like 20 years of taking meds and them not working and being told the problem is you
[09:43:55] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it was pretty easy to stop taking them because A) I was always told I was an addict and another prescription narcotic didn't sound to appealing to me (not that I was addicted to pills - I abused alcohol and weed and stuff like that to deal with life)

[11:34:05] <FromDiscord> <Krypton> https://security.archlinux.org/package/nim
[11:34:38] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Thanks
[11:34:56] <FromDiscord> <Krypton> here its saying that nim has a vulnerability which allows a normal user to access unauthorized directories ?
[11:35:17] <FromDiscord> <Rika> This is only inherent to the zip package it seems
[11:35:18] <FromDiscord> <Krypton> Is it true ?
[11:35:41] <supakeen> Sure, it's true.
[11:35:56] <PMunch> @Rika, haven't fine tuned the magic numbers. But this is one that looks pretty good: https://uploads.peterme.net/cube_dithered_m1-237_m2-082.png
[11:35:56] <supakeen> If you handle zip files from users they can extract arbitrary paths.
[11:36:08] <FromDiscord> <Rika> That looks nice indeed
[11:36:42] <FromDiscord> <Krypton> So the compiler is vulnerable to some arbitrary code ?
[11:36:44] <supakeen> The 'normal' way to solve this is to strip all leading slashes and remove all ..-components.
[11:36:46] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Actually the half grey pattern might be indesirable
[11:36:50] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Undesirable
[11:36:56] <supakeen> No, the compiler is not vulnerable, compiling code is already executing arbitrary code.
[11:37:15] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @Krypton "So the compiler is": Thatâ€™s what compilers doâ€¦
[11:37:16] <PMunch> @Rika, really? That's what I was trying to add :P
[11:37:24] <supakeen> This is specifically if you use the `zip` module in your program with zip archives containing certain paths.
[11:37:29] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @PMunch "<@259277943275126785>, really? That's what": Depends on the user I guess
[11:37:31] <supakeen> Other languages do tend to sanitize those paths.
[11:37:36] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Though it is nice IMO
[11:37:58] <supakeen> But *note* Python is vulnerable to this as well: https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.extractall etc.
[11:37:59] <FromDiscord> <Krypton> Hmm , so the compilers shouldnt be run with sudo i guess , i mean , no one does that
[11:38:10] <PMunch> Basically I tried to ensure that a half grey image would be a perfect checkerboard
[11:38:12] <supakeen> You're still misunderstanding this has nothing to do with compiling.
[11:38:29] <FromDiscord> <Krypton> Ok
[11:39:02] <FromDiscord> <Krypton> Nvm , i dont think i am gonna use zip modules anyways
[11:39:09] <PMunch> And this has the effect of minimising the black right next to black which showed up as hard patterns
[11:40:12] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Damn Iâ€™m not home so I canâ€™t compare with the original
[11:40:19] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Do you mind sending the original a dither add
[11:40:21] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Sample
[11:40:24] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Thanks
[11:42:00] <PMunch> https://uploads.peterme.net/cube_dithered_m1-237_m2-119.png
[11:43:04] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Okay I think the checkerboard pattern makes it look like it loses detail but of course itâ€™s not objectifiable
[11:44:17] <PMunch> There really isn't any detail there in the source image though
[11:44:59] <FromDiscord> <Rika> I mean more like it gives a feeling of 50% with some black spots on it instead of a gradient
[11:45:49] <PMunch> Hmm, I see what you mean
[11:46:49] <PMunch> Unfortunately I don't have my device here, so I can't see which actually looks better on the real hardware
[11:53:22] <PMunch> Hmm, the more I compare the two the more I agree with you..
[11:54:05] <PMunch> Still have to compare on the real device though
[11:54:50] <PMunch> But it's very noticeable when it's slightly more than half grey that there are black pixels in the otherwise perfect pattern..
[12:02:01] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Yup
[12:06:13] <FromDiscord> <dom96> In reply to @Krypton "here its saying that": This is weird. Why is this a vulnerability on Nim?
[12:06:41] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Itâ€™s a vulnerability in a package that Nim doesnâ€™t even ship with anymore as far as I can see
[12:06:58] <FromDiscord> <dom96> Can we remove this CVE from the Nim package?

[12:14:10] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> from reading it, it doesn't allow privilege escalation, when a user extracts a file to a directory they expect all the files to be extracted under that location, but specially crafted zip files can escape that directory (assuming they have permission to write to the target path)
[12:14:40] <supakeen> It's a common vulnerability that I think people now call 'zipslip'. Usually any zip library has both ways of extracting (making paths 'safe', or not).
[12:16:15] <supakeen> At least Debian has it right: https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2020-23171
[12:21:34] <supakeen> I've just commented in the ticket I guess.
[12:38:43] <supakeen> I've asked someone on the arch security thingy to review that thing at least so let's see :)
[12:43:00] <PMunch> @Rika, discovered I had made an oopsie in my code. Fixed it and went hunting for a better magic number combo: https://uploads.peterme.net/cube_dithered_m1-237_m2-095.png
[12:43:24] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Still has the same issue as Iâ€™ve said though
[12:43:36] <PMunch> Yeah, but that's inherit to the method I'm using
[12:43:41] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Yeah
[12:43:56] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Canâ€™t you make this faster using a shader or something
[12:44:04] <PMunch> Oh for sure
[12:45:04] <PMunch> Fastest (and what I plan on actually doing) would be to generate the whole "mask" for the entire screen I'm using, then it's just a matter of some lookup and quick maths
[12:45:11] <PMunch> Which should be super quick on a GPU
[12:45:14] <PMunch> Even on a CPU
[12:51:30] <FromDiscord> <Rika> Eh easiest is shader
