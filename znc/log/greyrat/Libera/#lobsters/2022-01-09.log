[05:37:37] <bkero> iDrougge: Correct. XMPP can talk to other servers on the internet if they let it.
[05:37:47] <bkero> Facebook and Google briefly enabled that, but then closed it.
[05:37:57] <bkero> So XMPP *Powers* their messengers, and it used to be part of the same global network.
[05:38:14] <bkero> Whatsapp is also based on XMPP

[05:44:43] <bkero> Nobody was ever fired for suggesting Slack.
[05:44:58] <imode> you're fired.
[05:45:15] <iDrougge> Actually, Slack is so expensive that a lot of organisations should jump at an alternative.
[05:45:51] <iDrougge> I worked at an organisation that chose Facebook Workplace because licencing Slack for 3 000 users would be prohibitively expensive.
[05:46:11] <imode> ...facebook workplace?
[05:46:12] <pushcx> Zulip is really slow and kinda flaky. If I'm trying to catch up on threads quickly it drops keystrokes. Slack feels fast by comparison (not that it's anywhere near weechat).

[05:50:17] <imode> if zulip was striving for feature parity, they got it. :P
[05:50:31] <imode> seriously, it takes roughly half to 3/4ths of a second for slack to register my keystrokes.
[05:50:43] <iDrougge> pushcx: I get that impression from web developers quite often. It's as if they didn't know that space jumps to the next page or that tab moves between input fields.
[05:50:47] <imode> discord? lightning fast, I can type as fast as I want and even do formatting.
[05:51:13] <iDrougge> Really? My perception of Discord is that it's slower than the rest.
[05:51:33] <imode> it is remarkably faster because as I understand it, they do text processing and other stuff on the client. try the web version instead of the electron one.
[05:51:47] <iDrougge> I would never.
[05:52:12] <bkero> The web version of slack is garbage
[05:52:14] <imode> I can start typing a sentence in slack and by the time it's been read by my friends in discord, slack will be 1/2 the way through it.

[05:52:24] <imode> web version of discord. not slack.
[05:52:32] <bkero> To be fair, the electron app *and* the web version (both web versions lol) drop keystrokes and reorder keystrokes
[05:52:39] <imode> yeh.
[05:52:47] <bkero> which make it nearly unusable for me
[05:52:51] <iDrougge> It's a travesty.
[05:53:00] <imode> because slack sends every single keystroke to their server and waits for a round-trip.
[05:53:07] <imode> like, they literally queue up keystrokes.
[05:53:19] <imode> they also do server-side formatting.
[05:53:33] <iDrougge> But as usual, the field is wide open for businesses like Slack and Discord because free software subscribes to suckless philisohopies.
[05:54:03] <imode> wanna know why? if I open the same slack account on another tab or another computer, it _syncs the damn keystrokes between clients_.
[05:54:33] <iDrougge> If Slack handles input character-by-character server-side, their use of Electron makes even less sense.
[05:54:39] <imode> if you have three slack sessions open on three different devices? you'll be waiting for a half hour for the clients to do ANYTHING, let alone display your text.
[05:54:58] <imode> discord got it right by Not Doing Dumb Things(tm)
[05:55:08] <iDrougge> I always have two Slack clients open.

[05:55:26] <imode> as do I.
[05:55:29] <iDrougge> Every time I start Discord, I see it doing Dumb Things.
[05:55:48] <imode> discord does dumb things, just ones that don't hamper user input.
[05:55:50] <iDrougge> One minute of downloading "updates".
[05:55:56] <imode> wat.
[05:56:01] <imode> use the web version, fuck their client.
[05:56:03] <iDrougge> Every bloody time.

[05:56:16] <iDrougge> I would never.
[05:56:18] <imode> why.
[05:56:24] <imode> they are the same application.
[05:56:45] *** antranigv[afk] is now known as antranigv
[05:56:49] <imode> the difference is that you mainline your fake browser's updates from discord, while I get mine from my browser vendor.
[05:56:52] <iDrougge> I have a hard enough time finding windows in my web browser as it is.
[05:56:58] <imode> pin that tab!
[05:57:10] <iDrougge> ?
[05:57:14] *** antranigv is now known as antranigv[afk]
[05:57:16] <imode> pinned tabs! you can do that now.
[05:58:03] <imode> I didn't know I wanted them until I used them.
[05:58:18] <iDrougge> I try to stay away from webshit.
[05:58:30] <imode> it's a native browser feature.
[05:58:42] <iDrougge> > Zulip also works great in pinned browser tabs
[05:58:51] <bkero> What version of Chrome is the Electron app of Discord running?
[05:58:56] <iDrougge> Amazing.
[05:58:59] <bkero> Are there any vulnerabilities? If there were would you know about it?
[05:59:08] <imode> probably fucking not.
[05:59:28] <bkero> Do they publish that info (version *or* vulns?)
[05:59:49] <imode> CVEs, maybe?
[05:59:51] <imode> don't think they do that.
[06:03:53] <iDrougge> I should just write my own Slack and Discord clients. Just a WKWebView.
[06:04:44] <imode> unless you can fake a browser really well you'll get banned.

[20:29:58] <ngoldbaum> yeah, i honestly don’t know why you’d prefer to use element to talk to people on discord
[20:30:08] <bparker> for one the discord client is mostly spyware
[20:30:21] <imode> why not use the web client.
[20:30:22] <bparker> it reports on every mouse movement and keystroke you make
[20:30:25] <bparker> same issue.
[20:30:39] <imode> the web client does that? how can that happen outside of the browser tab I'm in.
[20:30:44] <technomancy> plus like ... running one program is better than two
[20:30:54] <bparker> I didn't say it did it outside of the browser tab
[20:31:08] <bparker> plus you still have all the issues of being on discord in general, like the random banning and phone-walling
[20:31:19] <bparker> inb4 "I've used discord for X years and never had a single issue"
[20:31:24] <bparker> well lots of people do.
[20:31:35] <imode> do you have a source for that tracking, btw. I'm not saying it's not a thing but I'd like another motivating reason to switch that I can post to my friends.
[20:31:40] <ngoldbaum> but talking to people from a different client doesn’t fix that
[20:31:41] <technomancy> is the matrix bridge only workable in element tho? because ideally you could swap it out for weechat
[20:31:59] <bparker> me and several others I know get banned on the dot every couple months, sometimes just joining a new server triggers it, or sometimes it forces you to give them your phone number, THEN immediately ban you.
[20:32:03] <bparker> it's bs

[20:32:51] <imode> "If you only use Discord in the browser, and install a traditional blocker extension set to no tracking like uBlock Origin, Discord isn't blocked because they specifically changed their tracking endpoint from /track (obviously detectable) to /science, which is a naive but effective way to get around a filter list."
