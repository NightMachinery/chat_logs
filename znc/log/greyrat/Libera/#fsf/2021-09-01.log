[00:45:23] <Noisytoot> Guest42, What do you mean by "OSed"?

[00:46:05] <kompowiec> i know YaCy it's nice too
[00:46:06] <iShareFreedom> Guest42, the question is about freedom. The important isnt about good code, is about user freedom
[00:46:18] <Noisytoot> also searx, but that's a meta search engine
[00:46:22] <Guest42> Freedom to modify I suppose
[00:46:37] <psymin> does the fsf have cloaks here yet? :)
[00:46:42] <Noisytoot> iShareFreedom, Guest42 didn't say anything about good code

[00:47:06] <iShareFreedom> Open Source only speak about good code. that is the reason i say it Noisytoot
[00:47:26] <Noisytoot> iShareFreedom, bad Open Source code also exists
[00:48:06] <Noisytoot> A lot of people who say "Open Source" release use free software because it's better, not because it's free
[00:48:18] <iShareFreedom> When we speak about freedom is better speak about Free Software, than Open Source
[00:48:24] <Guest42> Like RedHat
[00:48:53] <iShareFreedom> always when i say free i say freedom, im not english im spanish
[00:48:58] <kompowiec> making an OS = quality correlation is a fundamental mistake.

[00:50:26] <joo> He was born evil
[00:51:00] <Guest42> He's clearly a business genius.
[00:51:29] <joo> Clearly to some :-)
[00:51:48] <iShareFreedom> Guest42 It is a subjective value judgment, but in terms of assessing the freedom of users, of course he has not had true intentions to the freedom of computer users. since it does not conceive freedom as having control of your own life.
[00:53:07] <Guest42> Why didn't Linux beat Windows?
[00:53:28] <iShareFreedom> Guest42 for more info i recommend you visit: https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.en.html
[00:54:05] <joo> Does anybody have any thoughts on this issue?:  Lets say I spend years developing an application for business and I would like to make money on it, and I would like it to be a way that respects the users rights. But then right after the launch it is forked by a competitor who has known about the project and waiting for the release and who has much more ressources. Any strategies a small business developing free software can think about when releasing software tha
[00:54:06] <joo> t has cost lots of money and time and not getting totally exploited by the market? 
[00:54:07] <iShareFreedom> linux, it's not an operating system, it's a kernel. Guest42
[00:54:41] <Guest42> joo you need to work on your business strategy
[00:55:21] <joo> Guest42, yeah clearly, thats why i am here to see if anybody has  some good ideas ! :-)
[00:56:06] <Guest42> Do you have link to the repo?
[00:56:21] <iShareFreedom> joo I recommend you to provide a service according to free software, or to provide personal improvements to users, of course complying with free software licenses.
[00:56:40] <Guest42> Open source business models are always tricky
[00:57:22] <Guest42> That business could acquire you
[00:57:26] <Guest42> Why didn't you aim for that first?
[00:57:33] <Guest42> If they wanted your code so bad?
[00:57:56] <iShareFreedom> joo I also recommend organizing a group according to the development of software, one focused with clear ideas about freedom and community project, involving a license that protects freedom like gpl.

[00:59:57] <juri_> I work for an open source business. it's hard work.
[01:00:06] <iShareFreedom> joo remember to use strong licenses, including copyleft

[01:01:06] <joo> iShareFreedom, sadly i have not been able to organize a group, but yeah the strategy is to provide consulting, support and hosting for this system... the problem is if somebody is ready to fork fast and they have many ressources, they can beat me at my own game. The license will definetely be copyleft, which will keep most companies at bay because they desire more control of their users.
[01:01:12] <davisr> Guest42, it is entirely possible to make a living selling libre software. I do, and make about $2k/month selling copies of an AGPLv3+ program. If someone were to fork it, I will take their contributions (if they're good) and put them in my own product.
[01:01:26] <Guest42> Oh nice
[01:01:29] <iShareFreedom> I recommend using the term free software or development of free software, in so jobs, so that the values involved are valued. If your work and your working group does not value ethics, it is easy for your work and effort to be vulnerable.
[01:01:34] <davisr> Guest42, it's by having a libre license that competition is not to be feared.
[01:01:48] <joo> kompowiec, thx ! 
[01:01:48] <Guest42> Interesting angle.
[01:02:54] <iShareFreedom> joo That is why it is important that the development of free software be maintained with strong foundations in terms of the ethics and values of free software and not just "open source"
[01:03:52] <kompowiec> https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/2614/how-could-the-open-source-business-model-work-with-games
[01:03:52] <kompowiec> it might also be interesting.
[01:04:01] <joo> iShareFreedom, yeah I would never use the term open source, and I would rather get beaten and get no money than compromise on the ethics
[01:04:22] <Guest42> Maybe the product has other things going for it?
[01:04:32] <iShareFreedom> davisr, te felicito, yo también distribuyo copias de software libre. (please translate it)
[01:04:43] <joo> that is also very interesting kompowiec  !
[01:04:48] <Guest42> Like Facebook has a network. If Facebook released the source code, it wouldn't matter that much
[01:05:06] <kompowiec> :)
[01:05:13] <Noisytoot> use decentralized replacements then
[01:05:45] <davisr> iShareFreedom, gracias, muy bien, but soy no hablar espanol.
[01:06:04] <joo> about facebook, yeah that probably holds some truth, but we surely need to set the poor facebook users free - but social media are important

[01:12:56] <davisr> Guest42, having software with "unlimited seats" is a great marketing bulletpoint for free software. In fact, it's possible to charge MORE for free software, since it hasn't any lock-in.
[01:12:56] <Guest42> You didn't need to Open source to achieve that end

[05:21:09] <DiffieHellman> tpefreedom: Unfortunately the only proper solution is to host your own email on a VPS or something. I don't believe you can sign up for protonmail without running nonfree JavScript, and nonfree JavaScript is required on each login. There's a IMAP/SMTP bridge offered to paid users, but that looks proprietary.

[05:24:37] <bugweiser> vps wouldn't solve the inherent man in the middle problem that email has.
[05:25:55] <iShareFreedom> tpefreedom i recommend you visit: https://www.fsf.org/resources/webmail-systems for more info about webmail-systems
[05:26:44] <bugweiser> see, for example, you 'buy' some domain name with hosting and email. Now your domain (email-)host get's this wonderfull offer from a third company : sign over all your customer's email affairs to us, and we'll handle it all for free, and your customers get fallback and cache and never missed emails. Sadly, loads of hosts take this offer.
[05:27:59] <DiffieHellman> Yes, that's a problem if you rent an email _service_. If you rent out a VPS and install postfix, that's avoided.
[05:28:18] <bugweiser> the 'raw deal' is basically that email is exactly like a post-card. Every post-office in between can read it (and store it and sell it and...)
[05:28:36] <bugweiser> and you don't have control over the chain of post-offices in between.
[05:29:07] <bugweiser> neither do the people that send you emails. Like your doctor-patient documents..
[05:29:19] <bugweiser> nope
[05:29:39] <bugweiser> nope to: Yes, that's a problem if you rent an email _service_. If you rent out a VPS and install postfix, that's avoided.

[05:33:20] <bugweiser> nothing guarantees that the postcard your doctor sends you doesn't go over mail-servers in between prior to it reaching your vps/postfix. It's kinda how email works (just that they 'forgot' an envelope for practical reasons).

[10:49:18] <kittyblam> that being said, any win or loss is a win or a loss.
[10:50:18] <DiffieHellman> Australia decided to make "OOXML" the standard governmental format despite how ODF exists, so that explains a lot.
[10:51:02] <kittyblam> OOXML?
[10:52:33] <DiffieHellman> Open Office XML is apparently the format that microsoft office uses, except that the spec is 6400+ pages and doesn't actually cover the actual rendering behaviour in a lot of cases.
[10:53:26] <kittyblam> lol, that is a joke. I have never even heard of that format.
[10:54:04] <kittyblam> everything, including iirc microshit, supports ODF lol

[10:55:29] <paradise2go> hello
[10:55:38] <kittyblam> hi
[10:55:50] <paradise2go> FIrefox is the best browser
[10:55:56] <kittyblam> DiffieHellman: Yeah, there really needs to be a coordinated effort against those attacks
[10:56:41] <DiffieHellman> paradise2go: Nah. Firefox is configured of the box to be spyware.
[10:56:58] <kittyblam> paradise2go: It is a nice browser browser that unfortunently has very non-private defaults and can suggest the user non-free software, and doesn't come with an ad-blocker or javascript disabler. By default it has analytics and can install things on your computer without your consent.
[10:56:59] <paradise2go> DiffieHellman You use Brave?
[10:57:12] <paradise2go> yes that is true
[10:57:16] <DiffieHellman> Brave is spyware too, plus it's chromium based
[10:57:18] <kittyblam> brave is also a joke lol
[10:57:44] <kittyblam> GNU Icecat is probably the most accessible browser that isn't spyware
[10:57:57] <paradise2go> I made a room just for arguing which browser is better ##browserwars . check it out. Its bridged to matrix as well
[10:58:04] <kittyblam> if you are familiar with vim I quite like qutebrowser.
[10:58:06] <paradise2go> Palemoon also seems like a good browser
[10:58:12] <DiffieHellman> Tor browser as well, but that'll be a bit slower
[10:58:18] <kittyblam> I am not very familiar with palemoon
[10:58:30] <kittyblam> yeah tor is nice
[10:58:48] <DiffieHellman> Palemoon is okay, but it can't keep up with the garbage web standards that keep being vomited up.
[10:58:55] <paradise2go> Hmm..ok
[10:59:12] <paradise2go> There is also a browser called baskilisk or something..
[10:59:31] <DiffieHellman> I'm pretty sure baskilisk is just palemoon with a few patches.
[10:59:48] <kittyblam> paradise2go: Matrix doesn't have any critical major freedom issues in theory, but in practice XMPP is better imo, the way its structured makes it to where the users have more power instead of matrix devs
[11:00:04] <kittyblam> also it doesn't require fighting keys every two seconds
[11:00:09] <paradise2go> yes
[11:00:11] <kittyblam> stable as a rock
[11:00:19] <paradise2go> why do people use palemoon and all?
[11:00:24] <paradise2go> Its also not that secure
[11:00:36] <DiffieHellman> No browser is secure.
[11:00:43] <lts> Do not like chrome/chromium? Do not like Mozilla? Not many options left.
[11:00:56] <DiffieHellman> There are no options left at the moment.
[11:01:00] <paradise2go> yes got it
[11:01:03] <kittyblam> ^ at least until security move towards mathmatical proof and simplicity
[11:01:05] <lts> That said, some browsers are more secure than others..
[11:01:22] <paradise2go> many people I've seen on matrix argue that firefox isn't secure when compared to chromium
[11:01:23] <DiffieHellman> If you get all IEEE, POSIX and RFC standards, plus all the works in the longest books written so far and put them together, you're still ~12 million words short of the current web standards.
[11:01:35] <paradise2go> which is true since ff still doesn't have sandboxing
[11:02:04] <kittyblam> I'm pretty sure it does
[11:02:17] <paradise2go> i think its in the beta only
[11:03:06] <hiya> Any Android dev here? I need someone to dev custom WireGuard App?
[11:03:32] <DiffieHellman> hiya: How much are you offering?

[11:04:01] <hiya> DiffieHellman: PM? We want to discuss things first
[11:05:07] <DiffieHellman> Not an Android dev, just wanted to know if you wanted it gratis.

[11:07:00] <kittyblam> Anyways, if anyone knows any physical proposals or projects to create a more decentralized physical infrastructure rather than just on the software scales of things let me know, very curious to read up on what ideas people have had.
[11:07:09] <hiya> We basically need a skin or interface on top of WireGuard VPN app for Android i.e. available on F-droid. Our skin would ask for username and fetch $hash(user).conf, which wg.conf for user and install it in the Wireguard App. Now our VPN app should give only these options: ON/OFF button [big one in center] and Copy local log [bottom left/right]. Nothing else. Only single location right now. Might add more (locations future, so no server list right now)

[11:41:19] <Armand> O_O
[11:41:58] <kilobug> hiya: "not finding Android developers who speak English and have time right now to work on your project at the fare you offer" is very, very, very different from "0 unemployment"
[11:43:15] <belgin> i would only take an android app project if i were desperate or the pay was huge because frankly android development sucks
[11:44:21] <DPA> Noone who needs money would develop anything for the sketchy dude with the milion dollar idea, who then doesn't pay anything after all.
[11:44:21] <DPA> And noone would take a job when they get more without one, or if they can't actually survive with the amount they get. In those cases, they have to fall back on other options.
[11:46:40] <Armand> belgin: I'd rather have good money for *NOT* being a developer. :D
[11:47:21] <belgin> yeah that would be great, but i don't know anything else besides computers
[11:47:47] <Armand> Ohh, I do work in IT.. but I don't do dev.

[11:50:17] <hiya> kilobug: but no one is even interested. They won't even ask. So they have so much of work yet news talks about unemployment 24*7
[11:50:25] <DiffieHellman> Ehh, reasonable demands are usually fine, but no-one else has reasonable demands.
[11:50:43] <hiya> belgin: how much do you wish to get for this job?

[11:52:43] <hiya> belgin: wow. I know why there is unemployment even more. Thanks!
[11:52:57] <kilobug> hiya: android dev requires very specific skills, knowledge and "mindset"; it's not like you can ask someone who worked in a factory for 20 years and just got laid off to suddenly start developping android apps
[11:53:10] <belgin> hiya: no problem
[11:54:01] <hiya> kilobug: I will ask an Associate Android developer that Google shows in those videos. Maybe they are human enough to accept
[11:54:33] <kilobug> hiya: unemployment doesn't mean there are no job with no one to do them, it can mean just that the workforce doesn't have the approrpiate skills for those jobs; and usually it's more like there 100k jobs left untaken due to missing skills, but 1 million of unemployment, so even adequate re-training (which would be costly and isn't easy to do, but sure should be done) wouldn't solve unemployment

[12:26:23] <hiya> That is where I learned OpenVPN and GNU Linux etc
[12:26:36] <hiya> This is how I learned and achieved a lot of things
[12:26:46] <hiya> I never could code though :(
[12:28:45] <kompowiec> I will probably be a wagecuck because I don't believe in my skills.
[12:28:59] <hiya> kompowiec I believe media is lying about unemployment in Computer Science graduates 
[12:29:14] <hiya> They are not unemployable only
[12:29:28] <Armand> I'm currently underworked and overpaid.. it's crazy.
[12:29:54] <Armand> My role is so far below my skillset, it's frustrating.
[12:29:55] <hiya> Me too
[12:30:05] <DPA> Coding is actually really easy. Its really just problem solving on steroids. Although, some try to outsource that to SO and somehow manage to integrate solutions without understanding them.
[12:30:16] <hiya> I do not even have a certificate in Computer science or MS Office 
[12:30:22] <hiya> But Linode accepts all my VPN guides
[12:30:35] <kompowiec> is there still as much demand for programmers, or are they just taking indians?
[12:30:46] <Armand> My only IT cert is the CompTIA A+.. from 2010. :P
[12:31:22] <kompowiec> I can't afford certificates, that's why I made some shitty one free from the EU
[12:31:24] <hiya> kompowiec one fact, Indians rarely code. They are Support or System/Network Admins

[12:32:07] <hiya> in India
[12:32:22] <hiya> armand, yes I fought with him over this, because a lot of Indians I know code too
[12:32:26] <Armand> Yeah, maybe India itself is different.. and not the only country in the world.
[12:32:34] <kompowiec> Armand: I don't envy reading the code
[12:32:40] <Armand> I don't do code.
[12:32:43] <Armand> ^_^
[12:32:52] <kompowiec> :)
[12:33:02] <hiya> One question Armand, have you ever finished reading a book completely? Like even a novel?
[12:33:08] <kompowiec> one headache less
[12:33:16] *** specing_ is now known as specing
[12:33:26] <Armand> hiya: Does almost the entire Horus Heresy series count?
[12:33:38] <Armand> Or the collective works of William Shakespeare?

[12:33:53] <hiya> My baby bro [Internet brother] wrote this

[12:34:37] <hiya> Is it usual?
[12:34:38] <Armand> O_o
[12:34:42] <Armand> No.
[12:34:51] <hiya> I never read a novel only
[12:34:53] <DPA> I'm told indian coders do make exactly what they are told to make, even if it's non-sensical.
[12:35:21] <hiya> DPA: fear of losing job + zero social welfare and parents yelling
[12:35:57] <hiya> Armand omg, so if I never finished a book completely, should I get myself checked ?
[12:36:06] <Armand> Yes. lol
[12:36:08] <hiya> I read and write a lot of content though
[12:36:24] <hiya> Linode paid me 1100 USD till date for 3-4 posts only

[12:36:36] <hiya> Some tech companies pay me 2500 INR for 900 words
[12:36:41] <kompowiec> the last novel I read was. dr. jekyll and mr. hyde
[12:36:48] <Armand> Still not read that.

[12:37:45] <hiya> only 20%
[12:38:14] <kompowiec> yes, I read books, but they almost always relate to computer science, or they are guides.
[12:38:14] <Armand> "RMS" = Read Moar Shakespeare! :P
[12:38:50] <hiya> In India it is common for people not to have read a book completely and still be educated.
[12:38:58] <hiya> My wife never read a novel
[12:38:59] <hiya> lol
[12:39:10] <Armand> My wife reads a lot. :)
[12:39:23] <hiya> I am not talking about syllabus books, okay? That we read.
[12:39:41] <hiya> I am talking about novel or other books in general. 
[12:39:46] <la_mettrie> my imaginary wife is a fantasy author
[12:39:50] <kompowiec> I am generally backward with any pop culture and art. I don't see value in that.
