[08:52:13] <Me-me> squid: Your lookahead matching is too broad, and your first match, interface 0/1, is looking ahead to interface 0/16's tag.
[08:53:45] <Me-me> (.|\n)*? is terrible and inefficient and also terrible. No offence intended :P
[08:54:10] <re101-squid-5> hahaha none taken, i am really not good at regex as is shown lol
[08:54:24] <Me-me> Is this PCRE?
[08:54:33] <re101-squid-5> its .net
[08:54:47] <re101-squid-5> but PCRE will work also
[08:56:43] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/DkkGxZ/2 Here, this is .NET
[08:57:13] <Me-me> They have atomic groups so it's fine. It's just a basic upgrade, switching out (.|\n)*? for (?>.+\n)*?
[08:57:36] <Me-me> Which takes it from like 15K steps to closer to 5K
[08:57:46] <re101-squid-5> ahh thanks so much
[08:57:58] <Me-me> Notably, the use of .+ instead of .* means that token will only match if there is at least one character on the line
[08:58:26] <Me-me> Which means that it doesn't look ahead to future blocks.
[08:58:54] <re101-squid-5> ah okay that makes so much sense
[08:58:57] <Me-me> And the use of ?> means (a) it's not an extraneous capturing group and (b) it's not going to backtrack into that .+, so it will only match one line at a time.
[08:59:19] <Me-me> s/only/always/
[08:59:19] <rebot> 14Me-me meant: And the use of ?> means (a) it's not an extraneous capturing group and (b) it's not going to backtrack into that .+, so it will 07always14 match one line at a time.
[08:59:50] <re101-squid-5> yep cool, thanks so much man
[08:59:56] <Me-me> Happy to help.
[09:00:42] <Me-me> For the future, you can click on the capturing group in the righthand sidebar to scroll to where that group is in the text. And in PCRE you can also use the debugger to go step by step to see what the pattern is doing.
[09:03:34] <Me-me> Having taken a third look at it, you might also want to make the group just before untagged, group 5 (9th group in v1), also noncapturing with the use of ?:

[15:19:59] <DanTowers> Thank you for the try digitok - that's almost there, It isn't quite working though. I need to ignore html entities as well - e.g. &nbsp; or &amp; or &copy; i.e. &xxxxxxxxx; - plus it is picking up the opening "<" and missing some text further along.
[15:25:00] <DanTowers> Do you think what I am  trying to do is impossible with regEx?
[15:27:12] <DanTowers> Sorry - actually regex101 didn't update the screen well. That is working very nicely. I just need to exclude HTML entities as well. I will copy your example to see if I can get that working.

[21:02:24] <OnlineCop> re101-horse-21: `\[0.1%\]` in your regex does not match, or increase, the values you've matched. Regex only matches text that is there; it does not perform calculations/math on the substitutions. You have to extract the value and apply that calculation yourself, then insert those values into the substitution manually.

[21:06:38] <re101-horse-21> The information returning to me was. I had to break it to 4 line
[21:06:49] <re101-horse-21> 🤷‍♂️ Ok I follow the rules
[21:07:29] <OnlineCop> I remember https://regex101.com/r/zMaQn0/3. This had a bunch of "optional" groups to make it match all those different files.
[21:07:53] <re101-horse-21> I’m trying to increase our decrease depending on (buy position or sell position)
[21:08:02] <re101-horse-21> Does data will move
[21:08:11] <OnlineCop> re101-horse-21: You can't do that directly with regex.
[21:08:46] <re101-horse-21> Correct you help me yesterday I think
[21:08:53] <OnlineCop> re101-horse-21: What you need to do is match "SELL ENTRY" and/or "TP1", and then capture the  `0.2895` (or whatever the value is).
[21:09:37] <OnlineCop> Once you've captured the value, you have to use whatever program you're using, to do your multiplication on Group 1 or Group 2 (or whatever group it is).
[21:10:02] <OnlineCop> So it's up to your program to do the actual `0.2895*0.4%` math itself.

[21:10:39] <OnlineCop> Then, you can substitute the new value in place of the original value.
[21:10:46] <OnlineCop> But you can't do all of that with regex by itself.

[21:16:17] <OnlineCop> I don't understand that at all, sorry.
[21:16:40] <purplex> He wants regex to forward from VIP channel to Free one.
[21:16:49] <re101-horse-21> What part?
[21:17:10] <purplex> Right, re101-horse-21?
[21:18:13] <re101-horse-21> +purplex yes you right Both channel are mine. I am using forwarding box calling junction box
[21:18:48] <re101-horse-21> When they connect you you have to do coding inside. This is why I have to break line by line
[21:25:42] <re101-horse-21> The free channel doesn’t give the same opportunity of the VIP of course we give less profit, to peoples. To do that we have to change the data, all the value you can call it how you want. An example if the signal for VIP is: entry at 43000/  TP1 45000/ TP2 46000/ SL 42000 then we will put on the free channel ENTRY 43500/ TP1 43600/ TP2 43700/
[21:25:42] <re101-horse-21> SL42500 The goal is for the free channel to make less money (because it’s a free channel and we give free Signal) and if people want make more money they will have to sign up for VIP. I don’t know if this makes sense for you

[21:35:15] <re101-horse-21> Ok I’m back
[21:35:26] <JohnDoe1> no that's too fast
[21:35:44] <re101-horse-21> Here the FAQ
[21:35:51] <re101-horse-21> Replace with regular expressions
[21:35:52] <re101-horse-21> Also, you can use regular expressions to do your replacements. For that use the command /replacerx. It has the same format.
[21:35:52] <re101-horse-21> There is a very convenient instrument to test regular expressions: https://regex101.com. Set the Flavor to “golang” and set the flags “Single line: Dot matches the new line” and “Global: Don’t return after first match”. This will make it work in the same way as a @junction_bot’s matcher
[21:36:44] <re101-horse-21> It’s just a small paragraph of course!!
[21:40:33] <OnlineCop> re101-horse-21: https://docs.junction.space/replace/ describes how to use the regex to match some text, but doesn't describe how to actually use captured groups.
[21:40:52] <OnlineCop> re101-horse-21: You may need to ask on their support channel.
[21:41:20] <re101-horse-21> I did
[21:41:35] <purplex> re101-horse-21: Yea that makes sense.. maybe you need another chance, can you tell us what is your regex question again?
[21:42:25] <purplex> try not to tell us about your vip channels, and junction boxes 
[21:42:41] <OnlineCop> TL;DR: Given something like https://regex101.com/r/zMaQn0/3, re101-horse-21 wants to extract the values after each of those keywords, then do "math" to change the values.
[21:42:42] <HyP3r> Heyho. How can I find all Strings like that "foo [bar\nbar]" and replace the "\n" inside the [] with a normal whitespace. I started with that: https://regex101.com/r/JZKTzJ/1
[21:43:22] <OnlineCop> HyP3r: Which regex tool are you using (or just regex101 without some tool)?
[21:43:44] <HyP3r> In the target I use then python 3.10
[21:44:10] <OnlineCop> Python's `re` module (less powerful) or `regex` module (from PyPi, quite a lot more powerful)?
[21:44:31] <HyP3r> It doesn't matter. Whats nessercary
[21:44:51] <purplex> I'll pick for him (regex module)
[21:50:08] <OnlineCop> HyP3r: I've got https://regex101.com/r/JZKTzJ/2 so far, but I don't like that it's adding a space in the substitution before the ']'
[21:51:11] <OnlineCop> Whoops: Lines 17-21 are definitely not correct.
[21:52:54] <OnlineCop> HyP3r: What about https://regex101.com/r/JZKTzJ/3 ?
[21:54:11] <HyP3r> looks really good
[21:54:29] <HyP3r> And I see that it should be replaced with something like ", " but yeah I can do that
