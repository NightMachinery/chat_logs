[01:40:05] <pasiz> telegram have tray icon, dropbox dunno
[01:40:17] <blackop> are you using discord?
[01:40:24] <pasiz> no
[01:40:30] <somiaj> well gnome is going to be version 3 for its life now, there is just no longer gnome 3, it is just gnome
[01:40:44] <somiaj> gnome 40 isi really 3.40 they just droped the 3. since it won't be changing

[01:43:06] <Khepra> I say!
[01:43:34] <somiaj> haha, from my understanding there is going to be no major rewrites, so no gnome 4, just steady changes so 3.38, 40, 42, 44, ... they decided to just remove the 3. from the versin
[01:43:45] <blackop> somiaj: i installed dropbox but it doesnt show tray icon on gnome
[01:44:05] <somiaj> blackop: do you have a systemtray showing other icons?
[01:44:07] <blackop> pasiz: some apps are available in snap such as spotify and discord

[01:49:41] <somiaj> well I'm just going by what google tells me, you could install stalonetray and run it as its own window
[01:49:42] <pasiz> qt programs on gtk environment is often bad combination
[01:49:46] <somiaj> it will show tray icons (it is what I use)
[01:50:18] <somiaj> I personally don't like status icons and agree with gnome, though lots of apps dissagree and use them
[01:50:25] * Khepra munches popcorn and laughs at gnome users.
[01:50:55] <blackop> telegram has tray icon
[01:51:10] <pasiz> yes it have
[01:52:04] <pasiz> maybe there's something that telegram have done better than dropbox (i mean other things than leaked users files open to world)

[01:52:45] <blackop> maybe i better use nextcloud
[01:53:18] <tjcarter> i3 is definitely not for me
[01:53:26] <tjcarter> I use too many nearly fullscreen windows for i3
[01:54:01] <pasiz> same here, runned i3 over year and that's just desktop switching

[01:56:57] <tjcarter> can't even imagine what chromium would do with that many tabs. I know I don't have that much RAM.

[03:45:29] <tjcarter> should, if the Linux side knew what to do with it yet.
[03:45:35] <Na_Klar> From a console, you can put processes in background and foreground. Okay. But how can I start a terminal and start several child processes in it which keep dependant on that terminal? So when that terminal gets closed, all childs get closed as well. When I put the processes in the bg, they are not dependent. When I start them in foreground, I cannot start several at once ...
[03:46:28] <Hydragyrum> normally backgrounded (but not disowned) processes are dependent?
[03:46:55] <Na_Klar> no they are independent
[03:46:58] <Hydragyrum> at least that's how zsh handles it
[03:48:06] <tjcarter> I'm not sure that a shell by itself has the means to do what you're after
[03:48:07] <Na_Klar> never have seen a &'ed process which was dependent on the shell which started it ..
[03:48:07] <Hydragyrum> or at least last I tried it did
[03:48:26] <greycat> !xy
[03:48:26] <dpkg> Slow down for a bit! Are you sure that you need to jump through that particular hoop to achieve your goal? We suspect you don't, so why don't you back up a bit and tell us about the overall objective... We know that people often falsely diagnose problems because they are too close to them -- it's easy to miss that there is a better way to proceed.  See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem
[03:48:38] <greycat> Na_Klar: what problem are you actually trying to solve here?
[03:49:28] <Na_Klar> I need to start several servers and pipes to run a software I wrote. For the convienience of the user I want to keep all that processes dependent on one terminal window, so the user can close everything with one click.
[03:49:46] <Hydragyrum> https://termbin.com/s8bjv
[03:50:25] <knotMez> Na_Klar maybe a shell script wrapper?
[03:50:27] <greycat> Write a wrapper process that starts all that crap and lingers as its controlling parent.  Then when you kill the wrapper process, it can send SIGTERMs to all the children.
[03:50:40] <knotMez> jynx!
[03:50:57] <greycat> It's almost like there's a standard solution to this. :)
[03:51:05] <Na_Klar> how is a wrapper script different from a bash script?
[03:51:27] <knotMez> they're not they're just a specific kind of script
[03:51:57] <tjcarter> I might not use bash to accomplish this particular task myself
[03:52:02] <greycat> It's just a description of the script's purpose.
[03:52:14] <Na_Klar> but when I start several processes in a bash script, they get executed one by one, unless I start them with & and then the bash script is gone as soon as every process runs.
[03:52:20] <greycat> It can be done in bash, or any other language.
[03:52:47] <greycat> As I said, make the wrapper process LINGER.  In bash, you do this by running "wait".
[03:53:11] <greycat> And before you do that, you run a trap that sends the signals, etc.
[03:54:27] <tjcarter> Na_Klar: If you want to do this in bash, search for Coprocesses in the bash manpage
[03:54:35] <Na_Klar> as I understand it, wait will halt the bash script for the started processes to return. but when I started the processes in background that does not mean the bash script (that waits) is a parent of the processes. so it will not kill them when get closed
[03:54:47] <Na_Klar> ok, that I never heard about
[03:54:50] <greycat> No, don't do that.  Just run the child processes in the bg, collect their PIDs in an array, set an EXIT trap, and "wait".

[12:58:53] <cadmio> I changed my hostname in /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname but in my router's "Client list" I'm listed always with my old name. How is it possible?
[13:01:10] <shtrb> cadmio, check your dhcp settings on the client list (it could have a name) make sure you had released your dhcp lease and requested the query again, the router have also mac-to-name configuration many times
[13:05:57] <cadmio> shtrb: I only bound my MAC address to a static IP
[13:06:18] <cadmio> but not my name and I can find anywhere where that is set
[13:07:53] <shtrb> cadmio, for instance I have "grep host /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf send host-name = s38x;" (on my debian machine)
[13:08:14] *** Quits: sputnik (kli0rf@user/kli0rf) (Quit: leaving)
[13:08:16] <shtrb> on the router you should have a lease file, it probably have the mac
[13:08:18] <shtrb> and name
[13:10:42] <shtrb> cadmio, you can do cat /var/dhcp.leases  if that is an openwrt to see the leases and names in the router itself

[13:14:24] <cadmio> no, on my debian
[13:14:42] <Khepra> cadmio: a node sends its hostname via DHCP exchange to the DHCP server. if you once used DHCP, it's then stored on the server, which I presume is your router; and if you're now using static IP, you can't change that from the (client) node
[13:14:49] <jelly> dhcp leases state will be on the dhcp server, not client

[13:15:18] *** Joins: sputnik (kli0rf@user/kli0rf)
[13:15:42] <cadmio> but I'm using a static IP not dhcp
[13:15:56] <jelly> then you can't set the name using dhcp
[13:16:19] <jelly> the sanest thing to do is possibly configure the dhcp server (router) to always give out the same IP to the client mahcine's MAC address
[13:16:57] <jelly> then you can keep using dhcp for configuration on the client, and the dhcp client software still sends the desired hostname
[13:17:28] <cadmio> I've already did the macbinding to my IP but I cannot set the name anywhere
[13:17:57] <Khepra> cadmio: then switch to dhcp to reset the name, if your router doesn't allow editing that

[16:11:21] <blackop> it tries but fails
[16:11:45] <blackop> i have to connect manually everytime i turn on the headphone
[16:11:54] <blackop> to bluetooth on debian/gnome
[16:12:15] <shtrb> blackop, as I had a related problem , can you peer it from the DE (gnome) and see if you have kernel errors post the peering ?
[16:12:31] <blackop> shtrb: how?
[16:13:06] <shtrb> You connect as usual, manually connect the bluetooth device,stream some audio ,  check if there anything in dmesg (new) error
[16:13:27] <shtrb> also ditch gnome :P and check under kde
[16:13:36] <blackop> i see
[16:13:37] <blackop> wait
[16:13:42] <blackop> i connected already
[16:13:43] <BCMM> i think there's a thing you need to install to actually support audio profiles for bluetooth
[16:13:45] <blackop> lets play spotify
[16:14:03] <BCMM> oh, it does actually work some of hte time?
[16:14:27] <blackop> it works but sometimes it suddenly disconnects without reason for a second and reconnects again
[16:14:39] <shtrb> Is that reproducable ?

[16:14:40] <blackop> also that issue which it doesnt connect automatically is annoying
[16:14:42] <BCMM> ah, sorry. was thinking about a missing pulseaudio-module-bluetooth thing
[16:15:20] <shtrb> BCMM , that is to support bluetooth in pulseaudio ( to support automatic headphone recognition) his problem seem to be different
[16:15:39] <BCMM> is it "trusted"?

[21:24:40] <PerfDave> malade_mental: both network-manager and ifupdown will use the same DHCP client, so overriding in /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf should work
[21:25:08] <somiaj> malade_mental: resolvconf and openresolv can be useful packages to help deal with multiple apps wanting to write to /etc/resolv.conf
[21:25:09] <PerfDave> something like "supersede domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1"
[21:25:25] <somiaj> malade_mental: you can also configure the dhcp client to not set the nameservers as asked
[21:25:29] <somiaj> as mentioned
[21:25:38] <somiaj> or change which ones it sets
[21:25:53] <PerfDave> I believe network-manager has built-in support for such overrides also
[21:26:13] <malade_mental> Yeah I know PerfDave , so that what I thought, that standard way should be to edit the dhcp client configuration directly. I won't have to worry  myself on systemd-networkd or systemd-resolvd or resolveconf
[21:26:34] <somiaj> It really depends on how you want to configure your network, so there is no standard way
[21:26:35] <malade_mental> it's a lightweight server so that pretty much answers my question. I'll just keep it old-school
[21:26:48] <somiaj> but on debian systemd and resolved aren't used by default
[21:27:01] <malade_mental> that's what I wanted to know somiaj :)
[21:27:23] <somiaj> Though the two packages I mentioned are good catchalls if you want to manually control your resolv.conf
[21:27:29] <somiaj> choose the one you like better
[21:27:36] <malade_mental> so to reload the network configuration, a simple service networking restart should be enough?
[21:27:48] <somiaj> otherwise as you found, you do have to configure each tool appropitely
[21:28:02] <somiaj> no, networking.service is not really a reload service

[21:32:24] <jasper_> malade_mental: I've been doing that yesterday. Fresh Debian 11.0 install. Basically what I did was "echo 'nameserver 127.0.0.1' >> /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head", then enabling systemd-resolved with 'systemctl enable systemd-resolved.service' and after that starting the systemd-resolved service.
[21:32:44] <malade_mental> nice one jasper_
[21:32:45] <jasper_> But, I don't know if that's _the_ recommended way. It just worked.
[21:34:06] <somiaj> In this case the recommended way varies depending on how one chooses to configure their network, debian often offers choice

[21:39:21] <malade_mental> ok, man 8 resolvconf was better information than man  1 resolvconf
[21:40:03] <f1yankees> That's probably fair, I could have phrased that better.  I have not yet upgraded to Bullseye because Bullseye is not listed as a supported OS by Nvidia.  Just curious if anybody has given it a shot and had success anyway?

[23:17:31] <greycat> Start by asking a question *in* the channel, that we can read without going to a web site.  Then we can decide whether it's worth spending the time and effort it would take to go to the web site to learn more.

[23:18:58] <sney> sc: if you suspect swapfile issues, nuke it and make a new one. but also, if you're doing a lot of i/o, the provider could be throttling you

[23:25:16] <greycat> my VPS doesn't even *have* the ability to swap, at all
[23:25:32] <greycat> I don't know what GCP is... maybe you can do without the swap, if it's causing an issue?

[23:30:58] <jelly> openface, you're building/installing a linux kernel from source.  Make "make" more verbose, to show you exactly which command is failing, that may provide clues as to WHY it's failing
[23:31:03] <greycat> sounds like it's got issues, or else this one user has issues
[23:31:16] <jelly> openface, add V=1 between make and modules_install

[23:31:57] * jelly has not compiled a kernel in years and may be wrong about that V=1
[23:32:27] <PMT> jelly: the problem is that it's trying to sign with an empty key filename
[23:32:56] <PMT> but the V=1 should work, I expect.
[23:33:21] <jelly> why would you want to sign kernel and modules at all unless you intentionally wanted to
[23:34:33] <PMT> if you looted the .config from a debian config file without editing that, for example
[23:35:06] <PMT> (or editing it manually, incompletely)

[23:39:25] <jelly> so if I'm guessing openface probably wants to fix .config, disable signing completely, then build stuff again
[23:40:27] <jelly> unless they really have secure boot enabled and their own keys enrolled in which case they would probably know more about this stuff than me already

[23:44:37] <sc> greycat: ya Google, sorry for delayed response, 4gb of ram for nginx/php/mysql on a fairly active wordpress site...
[23:45:36] <greycat> your VPS's memory is measured in *giga*bytes, and you still think it needs swap?
[23:46:15] <sney> wordpress is not known for being efficient
[23:46:29] <sc> nor php :-), but true... let's see how she fairs
[23:46:40] <sc> fares?
