[09:24:07] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> @Ablu:matrix.org we can add this feature. any other suggestion?
[10:08:09] <SpaceVimBot> <Ablu:matrix.org> wsdjeg (Wang Shidong):  think expanding and contracting the iedit selection (mostly using left/right/e/w/...) would cover 90% of my Ctrl+D workflow from vscode... To cover full 100% I would also love something like "start iedit mode with current selection (not all matches) but allow to expand the selection to the next match". But I understand that hardcore vim Users would argue that there may be better ways to do such 
[12:43:59] <SpaceVimBot> <Shouhiro> I want to open macvim with neovim,but always is vim, how can I get it?

[13:42:36] <SpaceVimBot> <ProudNoob> how do I reply tâ€Œo that dude through this bot
[15:08:42] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> The nick is after the name of bot
[15:09:14] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> @Shouhiro macvim do not support neovim. you can have a try with neovim-qt
[15:10:56] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> any doc about this feature?
[16:12:12] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> @Ablu:matrix.org hi, the key bindings `e` `w` and `b` has been added for iedit-normal mode.
[16:27:40] <SpaceVimBot> <Ablu:matrix.org> @wsdjeg: https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks/add_cursor_current_selection_one_by_one.gif maybe makes it clear. Ctrl+D basically just searches the next occurence of the current selection. I find this a really inuitive and powerful way to do mass edits, since Ctrl+Left/Right allows to expand the selection further. For example, do delete the right of a couble of `foo = 123` lines, I can pl
[16:30:43] <SpaceVimBot> <Ablu:matrix.org> So with `e`/`w`/`b` support within iedit I meant that I would like to, for example navigate over the current iedit selection by simply expanding all selections.
[16:31:10] <SpaceVimBot> <Ablu:matrix.org> I just tried to visualize it, but it looks like I found a bug while it :P
[16:31:51] <SpaceVimBot> <Ablu:matrix.org> ```sfdasdf = asdffsd
[16:31:51] <SpaceVimBot> <Ablu:matrix.org> sdf = asdfsadfdsf

[16:31:55] <SpaceVimBot> <Ablu:matrix.org> ```
[16:31:56] <SpaceVimBot> <Ablu:matrix.org> if I navigate to the first `=` and hit SPC s e, then I get:

[16:32:20] <SpaceVimBot> <Ablu:matrix.org> Will report a bug for this later... Need to leave right now. But thanks a lot already! Will try it out later!
[16:32:28] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> ok
[16:33:19] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> the `ctrl-d` key binding in vscode is new feature for spacevim, and I will try to implement it.
[16:35:18] <SpaceVimBot> <Shouhiro> @wsdjeg Thank you~
[16:45:29] <SpaceVimBot> <Shouhiro> @wsdjeg https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13142418/80495522-9d955580-899a-11ea-9e2e-b621b1d821d8.png. Do you know  what's the app?
[16:46:05] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> It is neovim-qt
[16:46:13] <SpaceVimBot> <Shouhiro> That picture is in spacevim.org home page
[18:12:07] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> I think there is a bug of vim's `expand('<cword>')` and `viw`
[18:12:28] <SpaceVimBot> <wsdjeg> I do not know why these has different logic.
