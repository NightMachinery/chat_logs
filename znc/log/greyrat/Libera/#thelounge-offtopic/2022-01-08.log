[17:31:44] <bookworm> c014: if you're switching to docker use something modern as the base... else you have a constantly outdated kernel and container runtime. Go for something like Fedora and keep that up to date, should be easy considering that you'll only have docker on there and nothing else
[17:32:41] <c014> Not recommending debian ?
[17:32:53] <bookworm> definitely not
[17:32:56] <c014> hah
[17:33:04] <c014> Okey
[17:33:17] <bookworm> if you do, you'd need to run SID and that's not what Debian is good for
[17:33:20] <c014> Is ubuntu alright?
[17:33:26] <bookworm> same problem as Debian
[17:33:31] <bookworm> (for the LTS releases)
[17:33:46] <bookworm> you can track the 6 Month Versions, but that's slightly annoying
[17:34:06] <bookworm> to be honest I'd go for a rolling release distro so that you don't have major version jumps, but that's me
[17:34:28] <bookworm> sadly that then means something like Arch which is rather, ehm, manual in regards to install and setup
[17:34:42] <bookworm> could try thumbleweed I guess but I never bothered with SUSE
[17:35:11] <bookworm> https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/
[17:35:18] *** Joins: amcintosh (~amcintosh@amcintosh.net)
[17:35:38] <c014> I am running a vps on aruba, so my choices are somewhat limited
[17:36:04] <bookworm> if you can't mount an ISO your provider is shit :P
[17:36:42] <c014> Im gonna look in to that
[17:36:58] <c014> I Guess I have liked debian because it's pretty clean, just like freebsd
[17:37:38] <bookworm> depends 8n your definition of clean. Shipping year old buggy versions isn't mine 
[17:38:01] <bookworm> if by clean you mean licence wise, sure
[17:38:38] <c014> I mean regarding easy to understand and environment wise.. but that's probably more a thing of getting used to
[17:39:01] <bookworm> debian is horrible environment wise, the have debianisms all over the OS
[17:39:07] <bookworm> they*
[19:15:29] *** Joins: eliocamp (~eliocamp@user/eliocamp)
[20:35:56] * xnaas plenty happy with his Docker on Debian situation. 
[20:36:10] <xnaas> Was fine on 10, still fine on 11.
[20:36:45] <xnaas> Since the Docker packages come from Docker anyway and not Debian, updates aren't really an issue.
[20:36:57] <bookworm> and that's where your problem starts
[20:37:02] <bookworm> you can't even use the internal repos...
[20:37:28] <xnaas> Who cares?
[20:37:35] <bookworm> o/
[20:37:48] <bookworm> that's literally the job of the distro
[20:38:01] <bookworm> if they can't even manage that, why do you even need them?
[20:39:07] <bookworm> and considering that docker is pretty much just a fancy UX over the namespace features in the kernel you *really* want a kernel that is relatively new
[20:39:58] <xnaas> My only word of advice if you go with a rolling distro, c014, is to stay on top of updates. If you fall too far behind, you can have a bad time trying to get caught back up. Keyword: can. Obviously nothing is guaranteed in the software world. :P
[20:40:54] <bookworm> that only happens if you fail to update when the package manager changes behavior
[20:40:57] <bookworm> as in switches to zstd compression by default for example
[20:41:04] <bookworm> (in the case of Arch)
[20:41:54] <bookworm> but to be honest, of course you need to update often... after all you have security critical updates frequently
[20:42:17] <bookworm> same applies to any of the stable distros too btw
[20:43:27] <xnaas> There's "best practice" and then there's "what actually happens" and pretending only the former happens would be silly.
[20:44:06] <xnaas> We don't live in a perfect world where everyone does what they should. ;P -- also: yes, configure automatic security updates. üëç
[20:44:34] <bookworm> Update once a month doesn't cut it
[20:44:42] <bookworm> by now your box would probably be owned if you ran any kind of java app with log4j in it if you didn't update for a month
[20:44:42] <bookworm> well, I have the log4j bots in my logs... so?
[20:44:42] <bookworm> not that I run java things, but they still try
[20:44:42] <bookworm> and it's not like I'm hosting something that puts me on a scan list
[20:44:42] <bookworm> they simply attack all of ipv4
[20:45:07] <xnaas> Yeah, was funny to see the logs in nginx almost immediately 
[20:46:15] <xnaas> Added a fail2ban for it (though that doesn't help, depending on what way you're vulnerable; I wasn't vulnerable in any way) just to see how many bans I could get going. :P
[20:46:38] <xnaas> Shockingly, only got about a dozen or so!
