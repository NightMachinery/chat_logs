[05:07:49] <TallguyTYO> Hello, I'm learning django and DRF. I'm working on Will Vincent's tutorial here https://learndjango.com/tutorials/official-django-rest-framework-tutorial-beginners

[05:08:22] <FunkyBob> BinarySavior: potentially... what problem do you see this solving?
[05:08:28] <FunkyBob> because it sounds like you want a many-to-many relation
[05:08:47] <TallguyTYO> When adding a relationship to a model I get the commented syntax error from on_delete https://dpaste.org/g6ju
[05:09:16] <BinarySavior> FunkyBob, Model=Walk, foreign key = Dog or dogs, Walk has boolean fields for poop and pee, which exist for each dog on walk
[05:09:26] <FunkyBob> TallguyTYO: which relationship did you add? and can you include the full tracback in another paste, please?
[05:09:29] <TallguyTYO> Django 3.2.10, no need for those args in the official Django docs. I'm confused
[05:11:09] <FunkyBob> BinarySavior: so you have Walk records shared between multiple Dogs
[05:11:18] <FunkyBob> BinarySavior: and a Dog can go on multiple Walks?
[05:12:05] <FunkyBob> TallguyTYO: you've missed a comma before on_delete
[05:12:11] <FunkyBob>     owner = models.ForeignKey('auth.User', related_name='snippets' on_delete=models.CASCADE)
[05:12:13] <BinarySavior> yes, dogs can go on walk together (if that's what you mean by shared) and they can go on multiple walks, yes
[05:13:42] <BinarySavior> would that be many to many relationship?
[05:13:57] <FunkyBob> BinarySavior: it would
[05:14:06] <FunkyBob> BinarySavior: but if you _also_ want to record wee/poo per dog, per walk
[05:14:14] <FunkyBob> you will need an explicit through table

[05:22:10] <BinarySavior> or if I want to scale this in the future it might be better to just make the many to many fields
[05:22:34] <gcain> I guess it would work something along the lines of; I spin up a worker with the location of. some data to deserialzier into models. Then I run my analysis process over it using Redis as a results backend, then one done, I serialize the result back to a filestore.

[06:47:17] <FunkyBob> your management interface shouldn't make it possible to create a profile/user who isn't in your group
[06:47:22] <FunkyBob> but you will abuse admin, so...
[06:56:07] <yanchai> FunkyBob: it doesnt bob. all i want to know is how can i show a message based on my model conditions checking and making sure that before this student profile is saved it checks the user.user_type == 'student' else: show this message
[06:57:19] <yanchai> FunkyBob: StudentProfile inherits the user model and User has a field user_type which contains student or employee
[06:58:03] <yanchai> its like in StudentAdmin(models.Model) in the save method it checks the user relation field user_type to make sure it is a student
[06:58:17] <FunkyBob> if it doesn't make it possible, you've no need for the check or warning. so clearly it makes it possible
[06:59:15] <FunkyBob> subclassing models is rarely clean :/
[06:59:28] <FunkyBob> having user_type ... hmm... going to get messy
[06:59:49] <FunkyBob> if it's not a student, it shouldn't show in t hat list
[07:00:28] <yanchai> i added a user_type field to determine which profile to create
[07:00:53] <yanchai> StudentProfile and EmployeeProfile doesnt have a common field
[07:01:13] <yanchai> so i both inhereted the User model to those profiles instead
[07:01:41] <yanchai> inherited*
[07:03:23] <yanchai> StudentProfile has user_id foreignkey and EmployeeModel has user_id foreignkey too since not all users are students nor employee
[07:03:40] <yanchai> that's why i came up with two profiles
[07:03:48] <FunkyBob> foreign key?  but didn't you say it inherited user?
[07:04:06] <yanchai> sorry not inherited
[07:04:14] <yanchai> i refactored it to this way
[07:04:36] <FunkyBob> i'm lost
[07:04:46] <yanchai> hahaha sorry mate let me rephrase it
[07:05:06] <yanchai> i have 2 models StudentProfile and EmployeeProfile which both has foreign key user_id
[07:05:13] <FunkyBob> not onetoone field?
[07:05:26] <yanchai> yes onetoonefield
[07:05:30] <yanchai> i got used to laravel
[07:05:32] <yanchai> sorry
[07:05:36] <yanchai> so my problem is
[07:05:41] <yanchai> when i go to admin panel
[07:05:50] <yanchai> and tries to create a profile
[07:06:12] <FunkyBob> starting to sound like maybe you want limit_choice_to
[07:06:27] <yanchai> in the userfield, it shows a dropdown which contains all users both students and employees based on their user_type field
[07:06:43] <yanchai> i added a user_type field in user table to determine which profile they belong
[07:06:48] <yanchai> but
[07:06:58] <yanchai> the prob is when i got admin panel and create a profile,
[07:07:00] <FunkyBob> so not inferring it from the related model existing
[07:07:33] <yanchai> lets say studentprofile and on the user field dropdown which shows all users if you select an employee user it creates a student profile
[07:07:59] <yanchai> so what i did is added a condition in my studentprofile model to check the user_type == 'student'

[15:30:25] <teut> thats what the purpose of csrf tokens are
[15:30:44] <teut> I was trying to understand them but I think I ll need a book to understand them
[15:31:21] <teut> you are using docker so who knows how many sites the request bounces between and reaches to you
[15:33:07] <behelit> i can try to disable csrf and see if that alleviates the problem.
[15:37:57] <teut> ya probably it will work

[17:24:51] <theprophet> and how do i iterate over jokes then?
[17:25:00] <theprophet> if
[17:25:03] <theprophet> .value does not work
[17:25:05] <theprophet> what does?
[17:25:09] <theprophet> i am not getting this :(
[17:25:13] <GinFuyou> you have only one joke now
[17:25:45] <theprophet> but the same thing works in python output
[17:26:01] <theprophet> exactly same, printing the value
[17:26:09] <GinFuyou> No, you are doing something else in python then
[17:26:16] <theprophet> hm
[17:26:54] <GinFuyou> If you only want a joke string, you don't have to use loop
[17:27:10] <GinFuyou> then .value makes sense
[17:27:14] <theprophet> will it also be a random?
[17:27:33] <GinFuyou> random depends on what you request from api I believe
[17:27:55] <theprophet> yes, thats what i wanted to hear
[17:28:03] <theprophet> so i dont need to iterate over this?
[17:28:08] <theprophet> i dont need loop
[17:28:10] <theprophet> ?

[17:28:52] <GinFuyou> Depends on what you want to do. If you want only the joke text, not other data, you don't really need a loop

[17:30:08] <GinFuyou> for one random joke you could just use a {{ response.value }}
[17:30:14] <theprophet> in templates i mena
[17:30:27] <theprophet> i see
[17:30:49] <GinFuyou> but working with dicts is common thing, you better learn that too
[17:31:11] <theprophet> i swear, ive learned so much things, i slowly forget
[17:31:18] <theprophet> i am trying to get a job
[17:31:30] <theprophet> and this is like second sylabus for test
[17:31:44] <theprophet> if i pass the second test i get paid internship

[17:32:36] <theprophet> yea i already did the
[17:32:37] <GinFuyou> Well, then I suggest doing more learning projects
[17:32:43] <theprophet> {{response.value}} and it works

[19:59:50] <LuxuryMode> Pretty new to DRF and a bit confused. I want to write a serializer that will allow me to add some specified model objects to the related object set (many-to-many relationship). For example, if I have a publication and want to add an article to it. Would I simply set up the serializer with a field for the `id` of the Publication as well as a list of `id`s of the articles to add and then do the lookup of the Publication
[19:59:50] <LuxuryMode> `Publication.objects.get...` and then do the `add`ing? Is there a less primitive way to do this, e.g. instead of having a serializerIntegerField representing the `Publication` id, declaring it as some model serializer which DRF will automatically deserialize to the model from the supplied `id`?

[23:22:33] <LuxuryMode> hmm ok, thanks duoi. Do you have examples you could link me to by chance? Are these the docs I should be looking at https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/relations/?
[23:23:33] <duoi> LuxuryMode https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/relations/#example
[23:24:45] <LuxuryMode> This is for creating the entities together with the relationships though, no? In my example, I am looking to take an existing Publication (presumably using its id) and add several Articles (which also exist already) to it.
[23:25:31] <duoi> LuxuryMode sorry, perhaps i misread
[23:26:13] <duoi> is your intention to receive a list of IDs and create the relationships? in that case you would declare a ListField and add your programming logic to the serializer's create method
[23:27:09] *** Joins: audio (~audio@user/audio)
[23:29:31] <LuxuryMode> yea, that's right. Ultimately it'd be a POST request that says "hey, given this publication id and this list of ids of articles, add these articles to the publication"
[23:29:38] <LuxuryMode> so yes, I think you have it right
[23:29:53] <LuxuryMode> So it sounds like my original approach is the correct one, at least according to what you're saying
[23:35:02] <duoi> LuxuryMode if you scroll to the next example from what i linked you would see something similar to what you want to do
