[12:31:59] <gour> morning
[12:34:58] <gour> the more i'm looking for some note-taking app (tried Zettlr, Qownnotes,, Joplin, nb, vimwiki/taskwiki...), the more  i'm convinced that org-roam is the best solution. i'm vim as well Emacs noob and have working Emacs config based on use-packages and wonder whether you recommend using org-roam with evil mode (within plain Emacs, not by using Spacemacs/Zoom)?
[12:36:34] <zaeph> gour: Hi.  It's really up to you.  I find that evil-mode reduces your ability to acquire some of Emacs's core tenets, and it makes it a little harder to maintain software (because your mentality isn't vanilla); but from a purely user-centric perspective, whatever gets you to stick with Emacs for long enough is a plus.
[12:38:41] <gour> zaeph: thank you! i also read that for writing Emacs keybindings are better suited than vim's modal editing, and notet-taking, articles, blog posts, preparing slide-presentations, working on some book are my main usage, only slight html/css/php programming
[12:38:55] <gour> *notes-taking
[12:40:02] <zaeph> I think the only proper way to grok the difference and the efficiency and to try it for yourself.  I've never committed to vim-like modal editing, but I do love lispy which implements modal-editing in an Emacsian way for elisp files.  So, do try evil-mode if you're curious, but also try the default key-bindings and gauge which one you like best.

[12:41:25] <gour> ok. is there some support for org-roam suited for evil-mode or one is on his/her own?
[12:42:08] <empwilli> I know from spacemacs that it more or less works out of the box
[12:42:15] <empwilli> so you can at least look there for the proper keybindings
[12:42:55] <gour> empwilli: thank you. btw is spacemacs still on 'dev' branch without proper 0.3 release?
[12:43:30] <empwilli> I'm using it from dev branch for a while now
[12:43:38] <gour> ðŸ˜„
[12:44:01] <empwilli> (but maybe i'm no proper reference because i also use a frankenstein ubuntu with self-built stuff here and there)
[12:44:16] <gour> empwilli: have you ever tried doom?
[12:44:26] * gour is on debian/sid
[12:45:18] <empwilli> briefly, however, I shifted too many parts of my daily worklife into emacs so that I would have to take care of too many things in order to switch
[12:45:22] <empwilli> so it's not too ad hoc
[12:45:34] <gour> i see
[12:45:37] <empwilli> and imagining not to be able to read emails is difficult :D
[12:46:03] <empwilli> so I still plan to try it, but for now it works and I really need to have time for the switch
[12:46:16] <empwilli> (and then it's probably a huge investment just to try things)
[12:47:06] <gour> empwilli: which client you use for email? i've workign setup for both gnus/mu4e (as well as for neomutt), but recently was able to integrate taskwarriot with claws-mail which i  still use - it's more user friendly for other family members  ðŸ˜‰
[12:47:25] <empwilli> mu4e
[12:47:45] * gour does hope to migrate to it one day...
[12:48:17] <gour> ..when i finally migrate to org-mode for task-management
