[15:45:56] <rendar> if i have 2 div with tabindex=0, where keyboard inputs will go? it seems that only one of them can receive key inputs
[16:10:07] <lilmonkey``> rendar, a tabindex value of 0 just means that the element is focusable, and that it takes part in the natural ordering. (A value higher than 0 sets an explicit order, but you shouldn't generally do that.)
[16:10:45] <lilmonkey``> Naturally, only one element can be focused at a time.

[18:51:41] <rendar> the thing is: i have 2 div with tabindex=0, but only one receives onkeydown events, even if i click on the other one, why?

[19:02:36] <Rashad> My entire website uses only 2 divs
[19:02:41] <Rashad> \o/
[19:03:04] <Rashad> Everything else is semantic.
[19:03:25] <Rashad> Also I have a perfectly responsive design without using a single media query \o/
[19:03:28] <lilmonkey``> rendar, we're not psychic unfortunately.
[19:04:05] <rendar> what is a media query?
[19:04:33] <Rashad> CSS thing that tells the browser to use different code depending on screen size.
[19:04:41] <rendar> i see
[19:05:01] <rendar> Rashad, i think you must use that in mobile web, right?
[19:06:41] <Rashad> rendar: I use responsive flex styling instead, and use relative font-sizes based on the width of the view port.
[19:07:16] <rendar> cool!
[19:07:19] <rendar> how to do that?
[19:12:24] <Rashad> rendar: can't find the guide I used unfortunately :(, but basically you use calc(apx + bvw);Â  for the root element and use either em or rem for everything else.
[19:12:37] <Rashad> (where a and b are integers)
[19:12:47] <rendar> cool

[22:05:38] <CoJaBo> Does Firefox not support meta redirects in the sub-frame of a frameset? It only works when loaded outside of the frameset lol

[22:25:29] <CoJaBo> bin: New website, launched this week
[22:25:53] <bin> CoJaBo: you shouldn't be using framesets
[22:26:09] <CoJaBo> I'm actually quite curious how they found a developer who knew what a frameset is
[22:26:17] <bin> lolol
[22:26:37] <bin> someone's uncle who used to make websites back in the day i guess idk
[22:26:48] <bin> i know what framesets are but i wouldnt use them unironically now
[22:26:49] <CoJaBo> It's a fortune 500 company, I think
[22:26:59] <bin> jfc
[22:28:13] <CoJaBo> I don't even know where to start with this
[22:29:53] <bin> i wouldnt either honestly
[22:31:58] <Visage> Meta redirects AND framesets... CoJaBo, you know better than this by now.
[22:36:51] <bin> lol Visage that was my thought when he first said it
[22:36:56] <bin> i went into scold-mode lmao
[22:39:09] <Visage> Stop maintaining garbage and start making waves, or find a better job and your dignity. :)
[22:39:29] <Visage> Either way, this isn't 1997.
[22:40:11] <CoJaBo> Visage: I told them 1996, so close enough
[22:40:38] <Visage> CoJaBo: are they paying you enough?
[22:40:44] <CoJaBo> I showed the user how to right-click to open the subframe in a new tab, and this seems to be working
[22:40:55] <CoJaBo> Visage: Not nearly enough :/
[22:42:02] <CoJaBo> The other bits of the frameset are just menus and other junk. Also, the design is so bad the both of us are scrathing our heads trying to even figure out how to use the site
[22:42:55] <Visage> So in other words, a hot mess, excellent.
[22:43:38] <CoJaBo> My fave bit so far is the photo upload screen. You click the pic to replace, and....... nothing happens, and a slew of errors appear in the console. But, PLOT TWIST, this is normal; clicking the photo just selects which photo to upload, and then you have to scroll down in the inner sub-subframe to see the upload form
[22:44:13] <CoJaBo> Calling this a hot mess is an insult to heat and messes.
[22:54:59] <bin> lmao
