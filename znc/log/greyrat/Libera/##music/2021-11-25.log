[02:09:24] <DOMF> which is a fucking dumb holiday, based on a false premise 
[02:09:35] <DOMF> ##music related - there's barely any thanksgiving songs

[02:28:16] <Panther> Yeahm, that would rip my poor backpack apart.

[02:29:31] <Panther> 115 maybe 125 I could get on something I could carry in each hand.
[02:29:43] <Panther> Dunno, but I don't have one.

[02:39:46] <macrobat> we can only hope. they came down w the plague
[02:40:00] <DOMF> didn't they get better? That was months ago
[02:40:23] <DOMF> and there's been new comics

[02:40:30] <Panther> If the clicks don't hurt, that should be OK.
