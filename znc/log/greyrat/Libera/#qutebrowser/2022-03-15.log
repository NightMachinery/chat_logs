[00:56:01] <Guest17> Hi everyone! Maybe you can help me with this question to which I've found no answer in the docs or in the open web. Is there a way in the config.py file to have it call another file? Like sourcing another file from it? So as, for instance, load a theme which can be modified dynamically by pywal? Thanks in advance for all your help!

[02:41:56] <sedrosken> hi, I'm a longtime on/off user, but this is the first time I'm trying to use it on what is essentially debian stable. is the virtualenv the only way to proceed? I can't build qtwebengine/qutebrowser from source and then install it locally linked to my installed libs?

[23:55:54] <sebastor> what hoping to be able to do that with shortkey... thanks anyway
[23:58:18] <toofar> ahub: if you do `:set thing` without setting a value it'll show the current value in a message. You can your shortcut do something like `:config-cycle content.proxy val1 val2 ;; set content.proxy` to have it print the new value
[23:59:35] <toofar> sebastor: there is an old PR here https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/pull/4715
