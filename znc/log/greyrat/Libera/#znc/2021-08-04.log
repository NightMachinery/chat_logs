[02:20:46] <devslash> hey is anyone around ? 
[02:20:46] <ZNC-Linker> Pointless question detected! devslash, we are not telepaths, please ask a concrete question and wait for an answer. Be sure that you have checked https://wiki.znc.in/FAQ first. You may want to read http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html Sorry if this is a false alarm.
[02:21:01] <devslash> I am having trouble logging into znc from any client
[02:22:48] <MetaNova> devslash: mind sharing the IP and port (in private)?
[02:22:59] <MetaNova> I'd like to make sure the port is open and ZNC is actually accepting connections
[02:23:19] <MetaNova> I don't need any credentials because I won't be logging in, just looking for a password prompt
[02:23:33] <devslash> I dont host ZNC myself
[02:23:50] <devslash> I have a seedbox service and they updated my server
[02:24:06] <devslash> is there something in ZNC that tells me how to connect clients 
[02:24:07] <MetaNova> oh, a seedbox
[02:24:12] <MetaNova> [[]]
[02:24:13] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/
[02:24:17] <devslash> Im not worried about ports
[02:24:38] <DarthGandalf> MetaNova: they didn't even share the error message
[02:24:46] <DarthGandalf> you're too far ahead in debugging this
[02:24:54] <devslash> it fails to connect
[02:24:57] <devslash> thats the error
[02:25:11] <Lartza> That's not the full error
[02:25:16] <devslash> it is on my end
[02:25:28] <Lartza> No connection refused? No connection timed out?
[02:25:29] <devslash> theres nothing else from my client except connection refused
[02:25:34] <Lartza> There you go...
[02:25:39] <DarthGandalf> "except"
[02:25:44] <DarthGandalf> you missed the most important part
[02:26:01] <MetaNova> "connection refused"
[02:27:15] <devslash> i dont know why
[02:29:47] <devslash> how do i confirm the right settings to connect to znc  ?
[02:30:07] <DarthGandalf> Ask your provider (seedbox) what they did to it
[02:30:32] <DarthGandalf> It's not running anymore; or maybe they changed the port and didn't tell you?
[02:30:34] <devslash> they moved me to a new plan which would change my servers' ip
[02:30:47] <devslash> thats why im asking how do i know what port znc is running on 
[02:30:55] <devslash> isnt there something in ZNC
[02:30:59] <devslash> that can help me out here
[02:31:13] <MetaNova> um
[02:31:16] <DarthGandalf> If you're running it yourself, sure
[02:31:20] <DarthGandalf> You can check znc.conf
[02:31:43] <DarthGandalf> But if they run it for you... ask them
[02:31:47] <MetaNova> znc.conf will show you what port, and what username
[02:31:58] <MetaNova> but checking znc.conf either requires local access or ssh access
[02:32:51] <devslash> I have access to it and im looking now

[02:35:21] <devslash> I opened up a ticket but they probably wont get back to me until tomorrow
[02:35:38] <MetaNova> contacting the provider is the proper course of action
