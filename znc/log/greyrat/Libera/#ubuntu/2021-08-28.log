[00:09:49] <chibill[m]> That was the last reboot so I would assume it should still be running. Unless it isn't supposed to be running the sound server all the time.
[00:10:00] <TJ-> chibill[m]: looks to me like you've got a RDP service grabbed it
[00:11:05] <i-garrison> even if "grabbed" pulseaudio server should still be responding to pactl info
[00:11:31] <chibill[m]> I use Chrome Remote Desktop to get into my netbook remotely. (I use it for my hamradio shack.)  Just to be noted it was already and used before PulseAudio decided to just kick the bucket.

[00:15:19] <i-garrison> chibill[m]: no, that's ok - that is how systemd is managing it
[00:16:04] <chibill[m]> Thats weird and backwards compared to most shared server type things.
[00:16:22] <i-garrison> chibill[m]: it's per your user session so not really shared
[00:16:54] <i-garrison> chibill[m]: please pastebin all output of this command 'PULSE_LOG=4 pactl info'

[02:55:27] <plujon> Greetings; I'm using 20.04 LTS and Wayland, and I'd like to make a screencast of a VM on my desktop.
[02:55:51] <plujon> I tried using recordmydesktop, but the video portion was mostly black.  I could see the mouse move, but not the virtualbox window.
[02:56:15] <sarnold> oh interesting
[02:56:15] <moha> Is it usual for a software, running by Wine, using totally more than 25% of CPU? (ref: https://u.teknik.io/jS7LV.png)
[02:56:16] <plujon> I don't know how to make the default screen recorder record only a single window and not my entire desktop.

[02:56:59] <leftyfb> plujon: it's meant for making gifs, but it can do mp4 as well
[02:58:29] <cbreak> 256 color 2 fps mp4s? :)

[13:27:06] <TJ-> VIA: when you say console it refers to a Linux (text) console you get without running a GUI
[13:27:39] <VIA> im used to using a console within a gui and without
[13:28:01] <VIA> console to me but i agree terminal emulator is more correct
[13:28:44] <TJ-> VIA: anyhow, you said the processes that were launched from within those terminal shells were still running after the terminal window was closed... that infers either they were detached from the terminal, the terminal only minimised its window but didn't exit, or they were running under a terminal multiplexer ('screen' or 'tmux' )
[13:29:17] <VIA> how do i find out and whats the solution
[13:29:34] <TJ-> VIA: well, first, are these 'lost' processes still running ?
[13:29:49] <VIA> of course not i had to kill it all
[13:29:54] <VIA> there was no response in here
[13:29:59] <TJ-> VIA: so what do you want a solution to?

[17:36:11] <paul424> At the office are people who never saw linux btw.
[17:37:58] <ravage> teach them how to mnae the updaterr gui. they their windows updates. the ubuntu updater is the  same

[17:53:04] <ravage> paul424, im sure you can write some update cron to keep the packages up to date. but that does not count as proper support for their IT :)
[17:53:51] <paul424> heh ;) ... another point would be configuring printers, I will be back here on Monday begging for help :D
[17:54:36] <paul424> usually I use OPensuse Tumbleweed ... but for them I can get LTS ...
[17:54:48] <Sven_vB> an office usually has a budget for IT, so they might be better served if you find a local Ubuntu support business and connect them.
[17:54:55] <ravage> and then application X they use sometimes is windows only. and their old word documents look scambled in libreoffice
[17:55:07] <paul424> Sven_vB, I live in small town in Poland
[17:55:26] <Sven_vB> then maybe a less-local biz
[17:55:49] <paul424> scrambled ... I thought the libreoffice is a good equivalent of ms-office :)

[20:31:54] <jhutchins> One of the easiest upgrades these days is to swap out the hard drive.  We've pretty much gotten most of the spinning rust out of the way, but people are still replacing earlier, smaller SSDs with TB drives dropping below $100.
[20:31:58] <jhutchins> So what's happening to all of the drives that are being replaced?  I don't need or want a TB drive, I really only need about 40G.  I'd be glad to find a 128G or something used.  Where is the market?

[21:52:59] <Sven_vB> My Ubuntu focal notebooks 192.168.1.3, .4 and .5 can perfectly ping each other when freshly booted. However, when .4 goes to standby and is awoken, connectivity seems lost between .4 and all others, while .3 and .5 can still do all their usual networking. I suspect some sleepy network card confusion on .4 so I "systemctl stop"ped NetworkManager.service, waited a few seconds, and started it again; same with "networking.service", but to no avail.
[21:52:59] <Sven_vB> ifconfig shows "enp0s25: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500¶ inet 192.168.1.4" as expected. what should I try next? Identify some network kernel module and remove/add it? (I have a serial modem shell to .4 for easier debugging)

[22:01:28] <Sven_vB> TJ-, is there a lesser fix than reboot?
[22:02:00] <TJ-> Sven_vB: what does this report? "sudo ethtool --show-eee enp0s25"

[22:08:42] <TJ-> Sven_vB: OK, so disabling it should solve your issue. EEE is Ethernet Energy Efficiency aka power saving and those devices, for some reason leave the Rx side in sleep mode :)

[22:10:59] <TJ-> Sven_vB: began seeing that issue about 6 years ago; took a while to figure out the solution. It often hit people who dual-booted with Windows since the Windows driver would enable power-management and a soft reboot to Linux would leave the interface's Rx side asleep but it could transmit so it'd look like a broken ethernet cable or port

[22:13:15] <Sven_vB> now "ping: connect: Network is unreachable" albeit "nmcli c" says it's connected and has the correct network profile.
[22:13:41] <marenz> g'day. I am on ubuntu 20.04. I noticed that in my /etc/fstab, my root fs entry points towards a wrong non existing disk and wrong fs-type. But the system booted anyway. I was wondering if you can tell me why
[22:14:24] <Sven_vB> marenz, your initramfs probably used info from a kernel command line parameter, or has automated guessing.
[22:14:47] <TJ-> Sven_vB: does ethtool confirm eee is now disabled?

[22:16:56] <TJ-> Sven_vB: hmm! use "sudo tcpdump -ni enp0s25" to see if there is traffic passing both ways on that interface, or  if it only seems to be in one direction. There could be a deeper ACPI issue here to work around
