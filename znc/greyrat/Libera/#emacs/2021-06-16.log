[00:02:46] <caoliver> CapsBeGone, what broke you?
[00:03:21] * caoliver usually keeps local repo copies of anything he wants/needs, and usually there's a local-hacks branch.
[00:03:30] <CapsBeGone> it has like 5 dependencies, 2 of which probably will conflict
[00:03:43] <caoliver> Ah.  Submodule crap?
[00:03:47] <CapsBeGone> it depends upon 'ido', and I have Helm, so I know it might conflict
[00:03:49] <CapsBeGone> yeah something like that
[00:03:59] <CapsBeGone> if anyone has any good package recommendations to go through log files, I'd appreciate it
[00:04:03] <caoliver> VCV Rack can be fun that way.
[00:04:04] <CapsBeGone> currently tweaking out my setup
[00:04:10] <CapsBeGone> so far 3 or 4 failed attempts lol
[00:04:24] <CapsBeGone> but I DID get my org capture templates to suit the new job, so that rules I guess
[00:04:51] <grym> looks like hide-lines went AWOL 
[00:05:09] * caoliver has no recommendations.  I wrote a PERL script for terminal server logs that my boss called Termite.  (It ate logs)

[08:22:59] <technomancy`> but it's possible that was due to being enrolled in some remote management thingy they use for compliance reasons

[09:57:30] <dminuoso> The combination of things to trigger this is
[09:57:38] <twb> dminuoso: vim includes a perl interpreter so pulls in all of perl.  Also python, also lua

[09:58:44] <wheeler> dminuoso: what was your gc-cons-threshold set to?
[09:58:46] <dminuoso> When the problem begins, scrolling becomes slower and slower until a gc it triggered. By slower and slower I mean, if all I do in emacs is scroll up and down, it will get progressively worse to the point where it takes 2-3 seconds for a page to scroll

[09:59:49] <twb> handwave
[09:59:59] <Viking667> ?
[10:00:12] <dminuoso> What I dont understand, is *why* a high gc-cons-threshold leads to everything becoming slower/less responsive.
[10:00:24] <wheeler> dminuoso: yikes, that's a pretty high threshold
[10:00:28] <dminuoso> If it was just spurious lags whenever gc was triggered, Id get it

[10:00:44] <twb> dminuoso: I was about to say that
[10:00:44] <wheeler> I think the larger it gets, the longer it has to put the world on pause to collect the garbage
[10:01:06] <wheeler> The default is 800 KB
[10:01:20] <dminuoso> wheeler: The problem doesnt happen during a gc, that's the point.
[10:01:27] <dminuoso> The slow scrolling happens outside a gc 
[10:01:29] <wheeler> O
[10:01:32] <twb> dminuoso: re font-lock I do this: http://ix.io/1wcb
[10:01:39] <johnjay> i think i increased it to 10 or 30MB
[10:03:09] <stm> It's a tradeoff between frequent garbage collections with low work and infrequent garbage collections with a lot of garbage piled up.
[10:03:28] <dminuoso> The problem is not visible to the profiler, I dont see any CPU samples that dont make sense. It just seems that there's mildly high memory allocations inside jit-lock-function at various callbacks, mostly induced by haskell-mode hooks and syntax-ppss
[10:03:47] <dminuoso> Is it possible that maybe allocations become slower and slower the longer gc hasnt run for some non-obvious reason?

[10:10:05] <dminuoso> What is also interesting, is that the problem only triggers in terminal mode, maybe there aren't many users with the combination of "inside terminal + high gc-cons-threshold (usually because lsp-doctor tells them to) + heavy font-lock usage". Also undo-tree-mode seems to amplify the problem.
[10:10:16] <stm> dminuoso: Maybe the real problem is not inside Emacs but in the terminal you use? Something that is triggered by the way Emacs displays the lines when you scroll.
[10:10:52] <dminuoso> I use xfce4-terminal, but when I connected to the emacs daemon in xterm, scrolling was still sow
[10:10:57] <dminuoso> so this seems to be in the emacs daemon

[23:41:19] <grym> https://github.com/fniessen/emacs-leuven-theme 
[23:41:36] <YoungFrog> iirc the leuven theme is a reference to the city, but not specifically to the KU Leuven. the author live[s|d] or work[s|ed]in or near Leuven iirc
[23:42:13] <taeaad> Oh. There was a theme called Norway Today for Eclipse. Was pretty awesome.
[23:42:31] <taeaad> Not Eclipse. Eclipse is h**** ****.
