[06:24:36] <sheep> probably something with find and file
[06:25:04] <sheep> find is better than ls for use in scrips
[06:26:12] <sheep> do you mean a file that contains unprintable characters or isn't text, or do you mean a file that contains machine code?

[14:07:40] <chazy> what's the fastest/best way of wiping flash memory? normally i'd use dd but i have no idea what the optimal block size should be and i read programs like cat detect it automatically, so wouldn't it be better to use something like cat /dev/zero > /dev/sdX?
[14:08:06] <Ingar> what kind of flash? a USB? or an SSD?
[14:08:42] <Ingar> (if it supports trim, delete all and trim it)
[14:09:00] <chazy> it's a micro SD card
[14:09:35] <chazy> connected through USB
[14:10:00] <luca020400> you support blk discard
[14:10:18] <Ingar> sdcards usually don't
[14:10:30] <Ingar> not sure how erasing works there on hardware level

[14:11:36] <Ingar> chazy: do you actually want to securely "wipe" it or just clean it for reuse?
[14:12:06] <luca020400> also there's secure blk discard since some revision, revision was before 2010
[14:12:19] <chazy> just clean it for reuse
[14:12:42] <Ingar> chazy: just wipe the first MB of with dd and create a new partition table

[14:14:03] <chazy> yeah, the only reason i asked is i read somewhere a long time ago that flash memory gets slower when it writes on top of other data, so since then i first zero the whole drive, but maybe it's a myth?
[14:14:12] <Namarrgon> hendry: uninstall them with pip or find out where pip installs them to and remove them manually
[14:14:13] <mpan> chazy: myth
[14:14:27] <mpan> chazy: have you noticed that it writes over all data all the time, during normal use?

[14:23:14] <mpan> Ingar: SD cards do not support trim, so they will blindly erase and then happily overwrite existing zeros with zeros sent by the system. I also never heard about them having circuitry advanced enough to keep track of zeroed blocks by themselves to not erase them later. 
[14:23:45] <Ingar> mpan: that's what I was thinking
[14:24:09] <Ingar> or at least, that's how I treat them :D
[14:24:12] <mpan> Also time spent on zeroying and then writing data will be larger than simply erasing and writing data. It will just get distributed. ;)

[19:14:00] <grawity> lol I'm reading a blog post "how we sped up our android app's startup" and they find out that most of the slowdown comes from a ... performance measurement library

[19:14:49] <grawity> sounds completely normal to use root=/dev/mapper/foo, then
[19:15:06] <grawity> since that's what has the "mountable" stuff (btrfs)
[19:15:06] <AlwaysLivid> Hang on
[19:15:55] <AlwaysLivid> Yeah, but how is Arch aware of the structure of the BTRFS partitions if it, in my case, /dev/sdb2, hasn't even been unlocked yet?
[19:16:20] <grawity> the initramfs does the unlocking -- based on separate kernel options

[19:17:29] <grawity> maybe that's what you're missing, yes
[19:17:35] <MrElendig> Maxattax: the question is which of the backslash keys
[19:17:37] <grawity> (systemd initramfs can alternatively import a whole /etc/crypttab, though)
[19:17:52] <AlwaysLivid> There's a straight up root=UUID=(/dev/mapper/root's UUID) parameter, but there's nothing referring to the cryptdevice.

[19:18:04] <AlwaysLivid> I also had to manually enable opening cryptdevice's in the config.
[19:18:13] <MrElendig> if its using standard xK* naming, xK_backslash
[19:18:34] <MrElendig> or whatever capitalisation it expects
[19:18:56] <grawity> in all cases, root= has to reference something mountable, such that the initramfs could just do `mount $root /newroot`, so yes root=UUID=(/dev/mapper/root's UUID) sounds correct
[19:18:58] <Maxattax> MrElendig: `backslash` worked, thank you... is there a table I can find with all of those?
[19:19:08] <AlwaysLivid> Yeah, this is starting to make some more sense now. Am I supposed to add the cryptdevice parameter in the /etc/default/grub's `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` parameter?
[19:19:40] <AlwaysLivid> Yeah, that makes sense. Problem is that it can't be mounted... yet, because there hasn't been an attempt at unlocking the drive.
[19:19:46] <grawity> yeah, although I think it's GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX, to apply to all entries (including "rescue" ones)

[19:20:22] <grawity> if you include that cryptdevice= option, and make sure the initramfs contains the cryptsetup stuff (mkinitcpio.conf HOOKS=, iirc) then it *will* make an attempt at unlocking it
[19:20:37] <Maik93> Isaac_S: issuing "xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xresources" before "exec i3" should solve your problem

[19:58:27] <fredlb> I would like to dual boot arch and my current Ubuntu install, and my current setup is: /dev/sda1-3 current ubuntu partitions and an EFI partition. /dev/nvme0n1p1-4 current Windows partitions and an EFI partition (this drive used to have an ubuntu install). I want to install arch to nvme0n1, should I just reuse the existing EFI partition on that drive? And if so, is there any steps I need to consider during the installation?
[19:59:21] <grawity> 1) "will it fit"
[19:59:50] <grawity> other than that, no, it should work fine â€“ you *are* generally supposed to have only one EFI partition per disk anyway

[20:24:58] <h4rd3n3D> fredlb:  you can easily GRUB boot 5-7+ OSes from a single 100 MiB EFI partition (the Win install default), assuming you have a separate /boot partition to store your kernels and their initramfs for each OS.  That approach also works if you run encrypted /boot for one or more OSes
