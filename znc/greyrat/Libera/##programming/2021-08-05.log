I have a web app running on this service called Pythonanywhere (https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) right now (it's a django app) which is pretty great and straightforward, also cheap! However I recently started developing my web app using docker, and i think i have been enjoying the ability to modify some of the nginx config myself to an
[00:33:07] <Batzy> extent that i dont think pythonanywhere will support. Do you guys know if there is an equally cheap and straightforward service that will deploy a web app i've written in docker?

[02:49:34] <pyzozord> can text be little endian or big endian?
[02:49:50] <vdamewood> Technically it can, but usually it isn't.
[02:50:14] <vdamewood> Individual UTF-16 characters have endianeess.
[02:51:02] <pyzozord> thanks vdamewood
[02:51:15] <vdamewood> I should clarify my first answer. That was assuming you meant that text can be stored first-character-lower-address, or first-character-higher-address. You never see first-character-higher-address.
[02:51:21] <cq-work> utf8 doesn't have endianess. UTF16 and 32 both do. UTF-16LE and UTF-32LE is more common.
[02:51:39] <cq-work> But there are prominent examples of UTF-16BE such as used in freefonts
[02:53:31] <oldlaptop> UTF-16 text may include a special byte-order-mark character at the beginning, which UTF-16 decoders should generally interpret.
[02:53:58] <oldlaptop> Unfortunately, UTF-8 text emitted by bogus programs may also include the byte-order-mark character.
[02:53:58] <cq-work> Formally known as BOM, yeah
[02:54:10] <vdamewood> Bowel order mark.
[02:54:28] <vdamewood> Actually, Body-order mark is less of s stretch.

[03:41:42] <Quietwalker> hmm.
[03:41:59] <droid3> this plc/pid stuff is like the huge giant automation /control for huge stuff
[03:42:27] <Quietwalker> PLCs are in two groups, one is as remedial as you might think it is, the other, so advanced, it may as well be a modern CPU, complete with OS and everything (at least, that's what a developer would see it as)

[03:42:46] <Quietwalker> source: I write software for big robotic software, package sorters, etc.
[03:43:18] <Quietwalker> The biggest problem is a lack of libraries, and devs who want to do the bare minimum, so libraries rarely get written for common behaviors.
[03:44:03] <droid3> wait so some of these PLC/PID are just whole system on chip with there own OS that you can write programs on top of? Sort of like a big version of a raspberry pie ?
[03:44:10] <Quietwalker> instead folks will do stuff like, string position based parsing rather than say, using a parser for a data format like xml, json, etc.
[03:44:10] <Quietwalker> well
[03:44:39] <Quietwalker> usually there's an actual machine on the front and it provides an interface to the PLC so it can be treated like an attached device

I thought main was a term you use with other languages (not js).

I'm allowed to ask "if" I have any questions, but right now that'd be like 7 or 8 questions, which seems like way too much. Should I ask for clarification, or make an assumption and document it? I have two concerns: 1) They might not even look at my code and just run it against an automated test and if I assumed differently than
[06:42:19] <calamari> them, then I'm wrong. 2) However, in past jobs, they basically wanted me to make all sorts of assumptions and not bother them about tiny details. Any suggestions?
[06:43:42] <cis> calamari: If they're tiny details, then use it as a chance to show off your best judgment, and document your decision and why you made it.
[06:43:44] <blahboybaz> I probably want to keep my list implementation pretty vanilla and standard arost the whole thing (no unique parts) but whether to implement the functionality into the List class, whether to implement in a class of it's own or whether to implement in the user interface is all stuff I'm ahving to think about

[07:30:26] <IcyFlamingArrow> Hello, I have an exercise that states to create a "Write a program that converts letters of one argument to lowercase and then remove all of the extraneous uppercase letters in the switch." I have created this inefficient C Program "https://bpa.st/KMDQ". How can I optimize it?
[07:33:22] *** Quits: auk (auk@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/auk) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:34:08] <Stryyker> don't have individual cases etc. the compiler will hopefully optimise it though. case 'a': case 'A': etc
[07:34:34] <vdamewood> IcyFlamingArrow: What's an extraneous upper case letter? Wouldn't it be converted to lower case?
[07:35:13] <vdamewood> IcyFlamingArrow: Are you allowed to assume that the system uses ASCII to represent letters? Will you be dealing with Turkish text at all?
[07:36:01] <IcyFlamingArrow> The system will use ASCII. I will use the standard English alphabet.

[07:37:52] <IcyFlamingArrow> At the first capital letter of the argument, the program will convert it lowercase and cease.
[07:38:29] <IcyFlamingArrow> Something akin to, input:rrEr = output:rrE

[07:38:45] <IcyFlamingArrow> Output=rre*
[07:39:11] <Charlotte> are you writing a compiler?
[07:39:20] <Charlotte> in C (if I might ask)
[07:39:50] <vdamewood> Well, to convert an upper-case ascii letter to lower case, add 32 to its value.
[07:40:02] <vdamewood> 'A' + 32 == 'a'

[07:44:53] <vdamewood> Yep.
[07:45:15] <xeno> vdamewood: it's the same there, the 32-127 of utf8 is ascii
[07:45:53] <vdamewood> Nope. It's ƒ∞ which is 0xc4b0
[07:46:42] <xeno> what?!
[07:46:49] <vdamewood> Well, it is in Turkish anyway.

[10:24:41] <lockywolf> In c++, is there a way to make a function/method never modify any variables that are not given to it as arguments?
[10:24:55] <lockywolf> Via pointers is fine
[10:25:11] <lockywolf> But at least prohibit access to global variables

[14:04:32] <user51> >
[14:04:32] <user51> The typical way a processor implements a left shift by one bit is by adding the value to itself. I don't know why the 8086 used the carry approach rather than the adding approach. ‚Ü©

[15:59:21] <mrig> the science.
[15:59:22] <DnzAtWrk> We should start using wetware in hardware

[15:59:54] <pikapika> Its just that most people don't make that kind of software

[16:01:32] <DnzAtWrk> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_computer
[16:02:00] <Arahael> mrig: Many years of CPU experience, apple is designing their own CPU, practically, and have done so for a while now.  Their phones are more powerful already than budget intel laptops.  They then just upped it again by modifying them for a laptop power performance.
[16:02:15] <Arahael> mrig: And they don't care about any hardware cludges for backwards compatibility, either.
[16:03:20] <mrig> I was thinking that there must be performance advantages in so doing.
[16:03:24] <Arahael> mrig: At the same time, they make API's and frameworks that take advantage of that hardware as standard frameworks for the environment, eg, machine learning, hardware matrix operations, decompression...  So effectively your code is optimal by default.

[16:05:18] <user51> time to get some hardware i guess
[16:05:22] <Arahael> pikapika: First, it's not Java, and secondly, there's a lot more to it than that.  iOS is pretty much a single-app-at-a-time environment, whereas Android brings in the full linux multi-user system philosophy in it, so each app that's running consumes resources.

[17:10:13] <DnzAtWrk> doesn't svg elements already have mouseenter?

[17:17:28] <Lyn> is there any difference between PUT and POST, other than providing documentation for coders?
[17:17:43] <DnzAtWrk> the difference is in the server
[17:17:51] <DnzAtWrk> the server can handle them however they like

[18:35:12] <pyzozord> yeah you can totall just write a javascript svg visual editor in the browser and then as a save just make javascript grab the root node of the svg, call .getOuterHtml() on it, and save the string via ajax to the server
[18:36:14] <pyzozord> (not exactly sure if that was the question)
[18:36:48] <mrig> oh the editor will be server side, it is essentially a cli app. But am investigating JS for certain input UI actions.

[18:38:52] <mrig> it would be interesting to see how JS could update the display if an image is being effected using code in the terminal.
[18:39:17] <mrig> perhaps ajax could do this?
[18:39:29] *** Joins: Inline (~Inline@2a02:908:1252:7a80:c035:deeb:51be:5431)
[18:39:54] <pyzozord> that's also possible, there are two main approaches: polling (ajax) or continous connection (web socets). There are others too like long polling but whatever with that
[18:41:14] <pyzozord> the easiest most simple way, but somewhat brute force is to do polling, say once a sec ask the server if anything changed and if so grap the new complete string of entire svg, and then grab root element in js and do .innerHTML = newSvgString.

[18:41:58] <mrig> heh
[18:42:00] <pyzozord> but you can go fabulsly complex too. You can use React to do partial updates, you can use websocets to have a continous connection and so on

[18:43:44] <pyzozord> mrig: yeah than the brute force approach of "swap entire svg code each time" should be enough. You could make a diffing algorithm yourself, but then you end up pretty much recreating the core of react: the reconciliation algorithm

[18:51:09] *** Quits: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech) (Quit: Bye.)
[18:51:12] <pyzozord> mrig: yeah, you implement polling yourself anyway. You can use a debounce or throttle algorithm on mouse move events and send api requests on that
[18:51:46] <mrig> user51: It adds a flavor that accompanies that of tomatoes really nicely, hard to put your finger on what it is when tasting the sauce, but it's really nice.
[18:52:14] <pyzozord> mrig: you can find example implementation of these algorithms here https://lodash.com/docs/#debounce (click "source" link)
[18:52:24] <mrig> pyzozord: right that sounds like a useful module to have for go projects generally.
[18:53:02] <pyzozord> mrig: that would be actually in javascript still, go would behave as a normal web server unless you want to go the websockets route
[18:53:04] <gggp> private key signature is just hash from that key ?
[18:53:05] <mrig> Akronymus: oh I love chilly sauce too :)
[18:53:41] <mrig> pyzozord: the thing is with go is that I can sling it into a template and have it as a function of the server.
[18:54:09] <mrig> sot the JS would be coming from the server if you catch my drift.
[18:54:49] <pyzozord> oh that kind of module, yeah sure
[18:55:12] <mrig> worth having about as some reusable code :)
[18:55:50] <pyzozord> debounce/throttle come up quite often in frontend, definetly very useful to keep handy
[18:56:27] <mrig> would be important for keeping the cpu usage sane I should imagine.

[21:13:52] <sklv1> Izem yep, bridged networking should work fine
[21:14:34] <sklv1> the card has to be emulated because the alternative is the host delegating control of its own NIC, which would require the VM to provide networking, which you can see would be suboptimal
