[00:03:51] <robertparkerx> Cannot use '$this' in non-object context.intelephense(1030)

[00:04:55] <robertparkerx> yes
[00:05:14] <robertparkerx> Let me show you
[00:05:16] <__adrian> so first question is, why static? you should generally have a good reason for a static method.

[00:09:34] <robertparkerx> I don't know who wrote it
[00:10:00] <__adrian> k. so in order to fix this,  you're going to have to figure out what it does and why it's static
[00:10:19] <__adrian> this will let you decide whether it _should_ be static.
[00:10:54] <__adrian> that will tell you whether you need to (a) make it an instance method so it can use $this  (b) leave it static and refactor so it doesn't use $this

[00:48:26] <da_wunder> it most likely depends if you're using some framework like symfony, yii, laravel, etc. which one you would use
[00:48:51] <robertparkerx> is CakePHP okay?
[00:49:15] <da_wunder> never used - so cannot say
[00:52:48] <da_wunder> and each of those frameworks could be "okay" for your, we don't know what your application is doing, so check your domain logic for the needs that you need - and after that check out those frameworks and compare those with those needs and choose the "best" one of those - also understand that you might make "wrong" choice there

[01:04:23] <robertparkerx> Okay

[02:15:55] <Dr-007> but it also meant i had to change my mysql database to postgresql
[02:16:17] <teresko> there is this Sonata thing for Symfony ...
[02:16:52] <Dr-007> oh, i forgot, i mean; oh no i wanted laravel because i hate symfony
[02:17:06] <Dr-007> i worked with it once
[02:17:10] <Dr-007> didnt really like it
[02:17:26] <Dr-007> but i installed symfony and was like 'well, setting up the beginning for my api was easy'

[02:17:56] <teresko> I just use couple standalone packages from symfony

[02:19:01] <Dr-007> ok
[02:19:26] <Dr-007> do you know if you can call a php class / php code block from a cronjob with symfony?
[02:19:29] <teresko> anyway, maybe someone else comes online with a good ide a
[02:19:46] <Dr-007> because when i googled it, all i found was how to make a cronjob with symfony that runs shell scripts
[02:19:53] <Dr-007> ah yeah
[02:19:59] <Dr-007> never mind, ill think about it
[02:20:01] <teresko> what you do is, you call a CLI script

[05:23:44] <jeev> hi, using mpdf to build flyers, would there be any reason that background images wouldn't load when adding it as a document relative path in a stylesheet? previous functional set up would php 7.2/7.4 on ubuntu 16, this is 7.4 on ubuntu 20
[05:24:18] <jeev> absolute path works, document relative does not.
[05:24:30] <Rockwood> wht is mpdf?
[05:25:13] <jeev> it's a library to generate pdf's
[05:25:45] <Rockwood> is it PHP question?
[05:25:57] <jeev> i would think so
[05:26:43] <Rockwood> i think CSS
[05:29:36] <__adrian> no idea, but most likely a difference in the library itself. mpdf prefers https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mpdf for support

[09:30:29] <Blondie101010> you can, but there's a nice channel specifically for that: #regex
[09:31:44] <funhouse> Blondie101010 ok ty will try here first
[09:31:57] <funhouse> trying to verify lat/lon
[09:32:00] <funhouse> preg_match('/^[-]?(([0-8]?[0-9])\.(\d+))|(90(\.0+)?),[-]?((((1[0-7][0-9])|([0-9]?[0-9]))\.(\d+))|180(\.0+)?)$/', '41.883551,-82.702518')
[09:32:17] <funhouse> This still returns 1 if I remove the comma, I need it to fail it comma is removed

[09:46:07] <Blondie101010> unless you're searching for coordinates

[09:46:33] <Blondie101010> extract the data and then apply regular conditions to it
[09:53:41] <funhouse> Blondie101010 not searching just need to make sure its valid
[09:54:33] <funhouse> Question about extracting, so what I am doing is grabbing a .gz file, i currently use exec('gzip -d file.gz') to extract csv, then when done, zip it back up again, this is wasting time and cpu
[09:55:05] <funhouse> I tried doing exec('gzip -dc file.gz > test.csv') but its not creating the csv, permissions are correct, any idea?
[09:55:47] <funhouse> Works fine in bash
[09:56:00] <novns> funhouse, exec doesn't involve a shell, it runs a command as it is
[09:56:08] <novns> so > will not work
[09:56:28] <funhouse> novns ah ok, so I need to grab that in php I guess and create the file?
[09:56:33] <novns> funhouse, you can use system() instead
[09:56:37] <Blondie101010> use an absolute path, or use find to locate the file
[09:56:38] <funhouse> novns ok
[09:56:45] <Blondie101010> or check return codes and error messages
[09:57:32] <Blondie101010> it could also be related to the SAPI environment
[09:57:53] <Blondie101010> system('id; pwd') could give some hints
[09:58:28] <funhouse> Blondie101010 absolute path worked, thank you again

[13:25:46] <ramblebamble> kubernetes orchestrator?
[13:26:37] <AllenJB> cloud orchestration stuff nobody but the likes of NetFlix and Google should be touching (IMO)
[13:26:48] <ramblebamble> oh did phig actually ever take of? Heared of it, never used it though.
[13:27:25] <ramblebamble> AllenJB, sounds like it, but I was actually hoping you could spot me a link
[13:27:41] <ramblebamble> or do you mean kubernetes as a whole because it itself orchestrates images?
[13:29:43] <AllenJB> (As I understand it) you deploy a kubernetes orchestrator which then deploys the app. Massive headache if all you want is a single-node simple AWX setup (that used to just be a docker image/deploy) and don't have any existing kubernetes infra
[13:31:15] <ramblebamble> so like yaml configurations but only as a resource inside the cluster?
[13:32:05] <bodom> ramblebamble: i mean deploying an actual project
[13:33:05] <ramblebamble> bodom, the tool of your choice, be it build into a docker-image streaming/copying an archive into the server and turn it on, etc. depends on your toolchain and requirements, and there is phig, a maven inspired tool but I have never used it

[20:23:22] <teresko> what exactly is the behavior there?
[20:23:28] <Naktibalda> qqqhhh861: I think that your question is framework specific

[21:57:31] <Naktibalda> do you have so many conflicts that it became a problem?
[21:59:09] <ash_worksi> for the goal I am trying to solve, yes
[22:02:13] <relipse> We have an issue where a php cli script will not produce any output if the cron user does not have shell access ( jailed account instead), if we turn on shell access (which we don't want to do, the script runs fine) Keep in mind the cron logs say that it is indeed running in both situations, but the email is not getting sent out (same parameters)
[22:02:43] <relipse> so this is a cron job that is not producing any results when the cron user has a jailed shell
[22:04:08] *** Joins: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn)
[22:05:45] <AllenJB> relipse: Your problem might not be directly related to whether the user has a shell or not. It could be some other piece of environment information which is only "correct" when the user has a shell. For example cron users may have a different PATH (which determined what executables are accessible without specifying the full path).
[22:05:45] <AllenJB> I would look to work out exactly what isn't working - log the return code of every execution of an external command, etc.
[22:06:45] <relipse> ok
[22:09:12] <AllenJB> How is the email being sent? is it using mail()? Or an SMTP connection? Can you check the mail server logs to see if the code might be trying to send the email, but perhaps it gets discarded due to anti-spam measures (eg. SPF record)
[22:15:26] <relipse> ok the email is being sent by including wp_config.php and using wp_mail()

[23:20:57] <Thanatermesis> using nginx + php-fpm in sockets mode, I have timeouts everytime after 1 minute running, i hchanged all possible settings without success, what could be the cause of the timeouts?

[23:24:24] <Naktibalda> do you mean that your code takes more than 1 minute to respond?
[23:24:57] <Thanatermesis> I have played with all these values without success:  (nginx) fastcgi_read_timeout 1200s; (/etc/php/7.4/fpm/php.ini) max_execution_time & max_input_time & default_socket_timeout -> 1200, (/etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/www.conf) request_terminate_timeout = 1200s
[23:26:09] <da_wunder> just to note - don't expect users to wait that long for response...
[23:26:32] <Thanatermesis> Naktibalda, yes, sometimes i run manually long maintainment processes, I cannot run them because of this timeout... I was able to run it for easily 10 minutes in the previous server by changing the 2 first values previously pasted, but seems like i cannot anymore now
[23:26:52] <da_wunder> and with that long reponse times - most likely people are just hitting F5 - and that is making all that even worse

[23:27:32] <Thanatermesis> da_wunder, yes, is not for the frontend but for administration loops that i manually run in the backend
[23:28:04] <da_wunder> if there is need for some "long" running task, I would just use some queue system for that - so in your initial request just send message to queue and handle those messages in another process(es)
[23:29:08] <da_wunder> Thanatermesis: and really you should not run that kind of jobs via webserver - if you want to use webserver for those, then use queue system and consumers to handle those
[23:29:25] <da_wunder> but now something else, backin 30min ->
[23:33:08] <Thanatermesis> yes but at the moment i need to run a few loops and i need it to not timeout, i was able to do that in the past changing these values but not anymore
[23:33:30] <Thanatermesis> anybody knows why my server timeouts after 60 seconds of waiting a php code ?
[23:35:27] *** Joins: sarandom (~sarandom@gateway/tor-sasl/sarandom)
[23:43:59] <da_wunder> most likely you need to check timeout setting on your php.ini, and/or check your webserver configuration about that timelimit

[23:50:52] <Thanatermesis> ah!! finally found the issue, i was turning crazy since days
[23:51:20] <Thanatermesis> da_wunder, yeah all these settings were correctly, basically i needed the 2 first ones of my previous message
[23:52:26] <Thanatermesis> then i found that the nginx conf for fastcgi was overwritten (or more exactly not set the value fastcgi_read_timetout ) because it included a location in the local website conf
[23:52:46] <Thanatermesis> so i needed to add it on the website nginx local conf too for make it working
[23:56:44] <teresko> what an odd setup
[23:57:06] <teresko> if you are using docker, wouldn't the php-fpm an nginx be on separate containers ?
