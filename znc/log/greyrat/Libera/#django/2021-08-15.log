[02:44:45] <wallbroken> well, i need to create a little configuration form for each user
[02:45:15] <wallbroken> the configuration form must have: 1) dark mode flag 2) pagination item numbers
[02:45:43] <wallbroken> the idea is to create a OneToMany relationship between those setting fields and users
[02:46:09] <wallbroken> to create oneToMany in django, the way is using a ForeignKey between two models
[02:46:21] <wallbroken> here we have what i just wrote in the model: https://dpaste.org/Et9H
[02:46:31] <wallbroken> then i wrote something in the Form
[02:46:56] <wallbroken> https://dpaste.org/hYMa
[02:47:09] <wallbroken> i'm not sure i'm doing it right
[02:48:02] <wallbroken> and then, i created a dropdown menu in the main page having the dark mode flag and the pagination value field list
[02:48:09] <wallbroken> and a "submit" button
[02:48:38] <wallbroken> the intent is having the current values state loaded when you open the dropdown
[02:48:59] <wallbroken> and changing them only when "submit" button is pressed
[02:49:39] <wallbroken> this last requirement is because to apply the effect, a page reload is mandatory, so, I'll implement reloading on submit button
[02:49:47] <wallbroken> oh... i'm talking to myself
[02:50:23] <dodo> wallbroken: that sounds like a user config, not a page/site config
[02:50:39] <wallbroken> it's page config PER USER
[02:50:51] <dodo> right
[02:50:55] <dodo> see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/auth/customizing/#extending-the-existing-user-model
[02:51:42] <wallbroken> it's not OneToOne field
[02:51:55] <dodo> what is not
[02:52:04] <wallbroken> because the same value, for esample dark mode: true can belong to many user
[02:52:14] <wallbroken> so, the relationship is one-to-many
[02:52:32] *** Joins: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras)
[02:52:35] <wallbroken> and to implent this kind of relationship you will need ForeignKey
[02:52:57] <dodo> that sounds entirely wrong to me
[02:53:34] <dodo> every user has a "dark mode" setting that's either true or false, no?
[02:53:42] <wallbroken> yes
[02:54:33] <dodo> yes, then please extend the user model like in the link i gave

[21:45:16] <doismellburning> wallbroken: looks like you have some kind of migration/db sync issue
[21:46:42] <doismellburning> your migrations believe the table shouldn't yet exist and are trying to create it, but they're wrong

[21:46:56] <wallbroken> doismellburning: ok, and the solution is?
[21:47:06] <doismellburning> wallbroken: figure out what you did wrong, go from there
[21:47:17] <doismellburning> depending on what you want/need

[21:47:40] <doismellburning> e.g. if this is just a local test db, maybe skip the whole process and wipe it and recreate
[21:48:13] <doismellburning> or if you e.g. manually created the table (I assume not but you've not provided any context) wipe it and let migrations create it
[21:48:39] <wallbroken> doismellburning: fixed it
[21:48:45] <doismellburning> All depends on what you did, where you're at, and where you want to be
[21:48:47] <doismellburning> Excellent
[21:48:48] <wallbroken> i just deleted te database file

[21:57:50] <wallbroken> sure
[21:58:54] <T-101> hello. is there a way to have and entire path in django urlconf to require user to be staff, instead of explicitly having a UserPassesTest mixin in every view under that path?
[22:02:54] <T-101> reason I ask is that I have plenty of views that require staff user, and I accomplish that with UserPassesTestMixin. but I would like to test for other combinations depending on the global settings at the site, and as it turns out, having multiple UserPassesTestMixin in CBV definition isn't supported

[22:12:30] <GinFuyou> T-101, pretty sure you can define complex tests?
[22:13:12] <GinFuyou> at the moment what you've described is not yet possible I believe

[22:14:16] <knbk_> you can write a middleware that checks if the url path has a certain prefix
[22:16:15] <T-101> ah, middleware could actually do the trick
[22:18:54] <GinFuyou> ah, well, right, middleware can work like that indeed
[22:22:23] <T-101> but if I have middleware that checks request.user.is_staff, will that fire a db call on every request?
[22:25:16] <GinFuyou> It fires anyway I think?
