[05:04:49] <se7en> Hello. I am having some problems with a post-upgrade install. The package python-crypto was a dependency for at least one package I use, and now it is inoperable. I attempted to simply download the deb for buster and install using dpkg, but it failed to do so
[05:05:15] <se7en> Claiming that the package "python" is not installed
[05:05:37] <se7en> I recall reading a changelog during upgrade saying that python2 and python3 behavior has changed.
[05:06:05] <se7en> How can I reinstall python-crypto? I believe the script is python2. It is weechat's otr.py
[05:08:35] <oerheks> let me guess; python3-crypto ?
[05:08:38] *** Joins: orangejuice (~orangeext@user/orangeextract)
[05:09:37] <se7en> python3-crypto has no instalation canidate, apt says, and I believe otr.py is a pyhton2 script
[05:09:52] <abrotman> did you look for otr.py with apt-file ?
[05:10:29] <abrotman> se7en: did you complete your dist-upgrade?
[05:10:46] <se7en> otr.py is a weechat script, it has its own repository. It lists the dependency as `python-crypto`. It formerly worked
[05:10:53] <abrotman> (I assume you lost it upgrading to bullseye)
[05:10:55] <se7en> I completed my dist-upgrade several weeks ago
[05:11:02] *** Quits: orange (~orangeext@user/orangeextract) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:11:15] <abrotman> something you could resolve with pip?
[05:11:18] <se7en> I have not had reason to use otr on IRC until today, and saw it was no longer working
[05:11:49] <se7en> I'll try. I'm not a python programmer and don't use pip very often. I am only trying to resolve a dependency problem
[05:11:57] <se7en> ~] > pip install python-crypto

[05:12:02] <se7en> ERROR: No matching distribution found for python-crypto

[05:12:18] *** Quits: de-facto (~de-facto@user/de-facto) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[05:12:37] <se7en> But as I said, attempting to install the deb shows that the dependency, listed simply as `python`, can not be resolved
[05:12:57] <se7en> So whatever changes have occured for python seem to be more involved than I was aware when I skimmed the changelog
[05:13:13] <CarlFK> if I wget a .deb, how can I apt install its dependencies?  https://packages.ubuntu.com/impish/overlayroot only has 4, which I could do by hand, but there are tools for this...
[05:13:24] <abrotman> se7en: you checked the BTS to see if someone already noted this?
[05:13:37] <se7en> I'm unsure what "the BTS" is
[05:13:44] <se7en> Bug Tracking System?
[05:13:48] <CarlFK> gdebi will do it, but it has an alarming number of its own dependencies, and I'm sure I came across something else
[05:14:19] <abrotman> bugs.debian.org/weechat for example
[05:16:52] <se7en> I think I may have fixed it. Anyone here have otr to test it with me?
[05:17:01] <se7en> The github lists python-potr
[05:17:09] <se7en> I seem to have had the wrong packagename

[05:25:40] <sney> CarlFK: you can apt install ./file.deb and it will automatically fetch any extra dependencies
[05:25:41] <xx> are you using the script from weechat, or from weechat-scripts?

[15:44:55] <Walex> Khepra: IIRC Steam packages don't list all the dependencies they need, in particular that it needs i386 dependencies.

[15:45:45] <Khepra> well i386 is required for steam to install and run and I've built 32-bit libs too

[16:38:45] <Khepra> One major difference is that on gentoo everything is built with march=native. on debian, I build mesa, libvulkan, libdrm, with march=native  (primarily because the gpu I use is too new for bullseye's versions), but not all the other packages. I might also try build xwayland and sway, just in case they're the culprit, but somehow I doubt it

[16:40:33] <Khepra> the performance issue is in ETS2 (Euro Truck Simulator 2). it's often very jittery, but its built in FPS counter shows high FPS. input is NOT lagging when that happens. I am suspecting CPU scheduling or something related to timers/timing, but I've already eliminated the kernel so I'm not sure what else... glibc?
[16:41:07] <PMT> Khepra: I mean, profile it on Gentoo and Debian and compare?
[16:41:09] <Haohmaru> does that "realtime" kernel make a difference here?
[16:41:25] <Khepra> and today I've eliminated vulkan, as now I get steam to run without complaining about it; didn't fix the jitters
[16:42:05] <Khepra> Haohmaru: neither is realtime in my case. 5.14.17, based on debian's 5.14.x   .config with device drivers that I don't have, removed

[19:07:39] <satoshi> adding repositories to apt is significantly different in Debian 11 than in previous releases, installing "debian-archive-keyring" solves absolutely nothing, your old packages cannot be installed on Debian 11 without explicitly linking the corresponding key in your sources.list

[19:34:07] <at0m> oh, it's how Release files are signed
[19:34:19] <randall> It ships the archive key for the current release and the next release, to allow for smoothe key rollover. It doesn't aid you at downgrading, because that's not supported by apt anyway.
[19:34:35] <satoshi> I do understand what it does, and what it does will not work with Debian 11, you can't install any package from archive. They are archived because they are packages included in previous releases. It is impossible to install packages from previous releases no matter how hard you try to believe.

[19:38:05] <randall> satoshi: The package itself is doing what is expected from it.
[19:38:27] <randall> Which is, allowing to to upgrade from bullseye to bookworm without fiddling with release keys.
[19:38:30] <satoshi> to downgrade you have to have the software installed in the first place, installing from older repo any package is NOT downgrading!
[19:39:00] <randall> satoshi: Same thing.
[19:39:15] <randall> satoshi: Installing packages from buster on a bullseye machine is not supported.
[19:39:57] <satoshi> how can be the "same thing"? I install to Debian 11 just one package which only present in Buster. This by no means downgrading my actual release.
[19:40:27] <at0m> satoshi: so, i downloaded an old .deb that's dated 2005. dpkg -i only complained about missing depends, and leaves the package unconfigured.
[19:40:47] <at0m> but it sure didnt complain about any keys
[19:40:56] <at0m> it just tried to install

[19:41:39] <dpkg> When you get random packages from random repositories, mix multiple releases of Debian, or mix Debian and derived distributions, you have a mess.  There's no way anyone can support this "distribution of Frankenstein" and #debian certainly doesn't want to even try. See https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian and <reinstall>

[19:41:48] <satoshi> that will work, but if you want to fix dependencies you can have some pretty sweet breaking
[19:41:58] <at0m> satoshi: yup
[19:42:10] <randall> It's irrelevant if you downgrade a package, or install a package from a different release.
[19:42:15] <at0m> satoshi: how about installing to a chroot or VM?
[19:42:19] <randall> satoshi: Which is why it's UNSUPPORTED.

[23:26:22] <}8]> hi. so i tried to preseed my wifi password to debian-installer (testing iso on usb flash), and its telling me the password is either too long (>64 chars) or too short (<8 chars). the password is 60 chars (does contain a few _'s) and works perfectly fine when typed in manually. so seems to be a problem with preseeding. not sure how to report it
