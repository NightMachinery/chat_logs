[03:00:55] <amogorkon> The-Compiler, nowadays i'd say it's fairly safe

[03:01:05] <amogorkon> unicode ftw
[03:01:22] <The-Compiler> amogorkon: not necessarily, the default encoding can still be different on another system
[03:01:40] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: to "encode" text means to turn it into bytes. There can be many ways to turn even the same text into bytes (possibly different bytes).  Those ways are called "encodings"

[03:02:09] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[03:02:13] <amogorkon> [itchyjunk], https://nedbatchelder.com/text/unipain.html
[03:02:27] <[itchyjunk]> How do i know what type of encoding I want? I am writing an irc bot as a way to learn programming
[03:02:46] <amogorkon> you don't know, you only can guess
[03:02:49] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: it depends what encoding the irc server uses when it talks to your bot
[03:02:59] <amogorkon> it's a problem
[03:03:00] <[itchyjunk]> oh i see
[03:03:03] <The-Compiler> [itchyjunk]: https://kunststube.net/encoding/ is quite a good summary of the basic
[03:03:06] <The-Compiler> basics*
[03:03:24] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: as all you get from the irc server will be bytes,  so you need to know what encoding *it* used to create those bytes to understand how to turn them back into text.
[03:03:46] <amogorkon> which may be a lie
[03:03:50] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: utf-8 is the most common encoding out there these days,  but there are always lots of exceptions :)

[03:05:45] <The-Compiler> amogorkon: unicode isn't an encoding

[03:06:58] <The-Compiler> [itchyjunk]: if you're doing this to get an IRC bot for day-to-day use (rather than learning how to implement IRC, I guess?), there are libraries which do all this stuff for you

[03:12:33] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: like a lot of things,  "coding" has infinite depth and there'll always be "more" to learn.  Libraries are supposed to help make this easier by meaning you don't have to learn so much about the basics
[03:13:01] <[itchyjunk]> I should start with the basics though, right?
[03:13:12] <amogorkon> no
[03:13:18] <[itchyjunk]> Not really sure how to structure learning so i can grab the low hanging fruits first
[03:13:22] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: depends on your goal and where you consider "the basics" start :)
[03:13:30] <amogorkon> you should go where you like to go
[03:14:03] <amogorkon> there's always more and what's considered "basic" depends on the context
[03:14:43] <[itchyjunk]> well, i don't know how to translate things i like into programming. i like bots in video games and such. i like game of life type things. i like the idea of "AI" etc and lastly, i'll need a little bit of programming to do math stuff

[04:54:47] <akk> oh, wow, that's old
[04:54:59] <grym> de-facto: what python version?
[04:55:10] <grym> you need at least 3.7

[04:55:30] <de-facto> so hmm i cant run that then?
[04:55:32] <grym> de-facto: i'm running 3.9 and 3.10-dev on 18.04
[04:55:36] <grym> so, it's fine
[04:55:40] <habnabit_> de-facto, install a newer python with pyenv
[04:55:54] <grym> you just need to install your own python with either deadsnakes ppa or with pyencv
[04:55:54] <de-facto> i dont know any of that
[04:56:00] <grym> pyenv*
[04:56:21] <de-facto> yeah so i need to reinstall my entire ubuntu
[04:56:25] <grym> no
[04:56:32] <grym> you need to install a modern python
[04:56:40] <grym> de-facto: i'm running 3.9 and 3.10-dev on 18.04
[04:57:08] <grym> https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer ; https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/common-build-problems
[04:57:23] <grym> or https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa
[04:58:34] <de-facto> hmm will that break all the other python things on my system then?
[04:58:37] <grym> no
[04:58:40] <de-facto> i am new to all of this
[04:58:48] <grym> well, deadsnakes might; pyenv is very well behaved
[04:58:53] <grym> (i prefer it)
[04:58:55] <habnabit_> deadsnakes shouldn't
[04:59:13] <de-facto> its a bit above my head, so maybe i better wait until i find time to install a new ubuntu
[04:59:21] <grym> no
[04:59:35] <grym> but you should read about what pyenv does and then do it when you're comfortable

I would like to somehow plot a line in the middle somewhere and ignore the noise. It will not necessariyl be a line or a parabola etc in the real data. What would be the best subroutine to accomplish that,  please?
[07:32:21] <gry> Note: there is a lot of libraries imported, but you won't need all of them. I was just too lazy to comment them out when creating this example test case.

[10:50:52] <kevr> The problem is that you are passing it a tzlocal() which is ACTUALLY giving it the geographical timezone, so it works because you're giving it the ability to, but on the "Wrong result," you are applying the converted timezone that happens because datetime.now().astimezone().tzinfo has some preprocessing done on it by datetime, apparently, that converts the geographical timezone to the verbatim
[10:50:53] <kevr> timezone.
[10:51:11] <kevr> So, it is merely because, you are fetching the timezone that it's currently giving you and trying to apply it in a CET sense
[10:51:13] <kevr> but it is CEST
[10:51:37] <kevr> So it's just converting it to CEST, because you're passing a CEST timezone to it via datetime.now().astimezone().tzinfo

[19:01:10] <hexnewbie> I wrote a program that uses a moderate amount of memory, a quarter of it in 6 million strings. Now, it's not an issue (only 37 MB), but I wonder what the heck those strings are, and I've been wondering how to print them.
[19:01:30] <AndreaMoroUK> Yhg1s good question, I did always tried to use PyEnv before, so if you can point me to the direction on how to do things manually, I will be happy to test. This is something really new for me
[19:01:45] <Yhg1s> AndreaMoroUK: I can't really point you anywhere, sorry.
[19:02:04] <hexnewbie> I use gc.get_objects() often for non-strings, and has served me well where I've created too many objects of various types
[19:02:08] <Yhg1s> I would probably file a bug with pyenv, with details about your build environment.
[19:02:56] <AndreaMoroUK> pyenv is full of problems like this from many already (including me). We are getting nowhere, that's why I was aiming to give a go to the manual bit Yhg1s

[22:03:00] <bjs> if tf just arbitrarily overwrote zero'd variables with random values then it seems like nothing would work

[23:11:52] <bjs> no_gravity: but it doesn't have to add 3 more dirs, or 100 more dirs.  and nobody does Python packaging the way you do

[23:16:35] <no_gravity> bjs: Second, adding /projects/python_projects/ to the sys.path would mean suddenly all my python_projects will be searched when I import something. Which makes no sense.

[23:21:02] <bjs> here the extra directory is clearly a consequence of a simple, sensible decision for how Python's `import` works
