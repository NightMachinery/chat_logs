[06:21:57] <AOldMateWithAQue> Hello
[06:22:05] <AOldMateWithAQue> I have been working on NVENC with FFMPEG
[06:22:11] <AOldMateWithAQue> It's been going well
[06:22:14] <AOldMateWithAQue> but suddendly
[06:22:25] <AOldMateWithAQue> the function`nvenc_load_functions` causes my entire encoder to crash
[06:22:42] <AOldMateWithAQue> No error
[06:22:51] <AOldMateWithAQue> It doesn't just return a value
[06:22:56] <AOldMateWithAQue> it just causes a massive crash
[06:23:13] <AOldMateWithAQue> The thing is
[06:23:29] <AOldMateWithAQue> I call cuda_load_functions right before
[06:23:31] <AOldMateWithAQue> and it runs fine
[06:25:07] <AOldMateWithAQue> If someone here had anything even close to an idea to why this happens
[06:25:12] <AOldMateWithAQue> that would be super helpful
[06:25:38] <AOldMateWithAQue> (yes, the library exists on my system in /usr/lib + /usr/lib32)
[06:28:10] <AOldMateWithAQue> Well a look at the function shows that it messes with that lib

[20:52:31] <JEEB> ok
[20:52:39] <JEEB> for linux the simpler way out is to build with vaapi
[20:52:45] <JEEB> since it requires no custom SDK or loader
[20:53:02] <JEEB> actual "qsv" stuff requires libmxf (at least it no longer requires a custom kernel!)

[20:54:48] <JEEB> I think you might be catching on why I prefer vaapi for anyone who doesn't exactly want the QSV encoders
[20:55:01] <kepstin> yeah, with the vaapi interface everything should be more or less out of the box, although you might have to install an additional package for the userspace components of the vaapi driver.

[21:01:04] <kepstin> depends on encoding parameters. i think with intel gpus it just gets slower as you add more streams, so it should be easy enough to measure.
[21:01:19] <delsol> Can I do 2 streams at once? 3 streams? 4 streams? If(GPU_not_pissed) {offload}else{no_offload}
[21:01:39] <hyrc> some gpus give you a load estimate utility

[21:02:24] <kepstin> the only cases i've heard of where the gpu driver will reject a stream before it simply gets slower than you want is nvidia, where consumer gpus have arbitrary limits
[21:03:12] <delsol> Ahh, I'm screenripping in realtime, so "getting slower" goes pretty suddently from "works" to "not works"
[21:03:13] <kepstin> (on systems without arbitrary limits, the limits will be based on gpu ram mostly, i think?)
[21:04:23] <kepstin> yeah, you have to measure it given your specific video parameters and hardware to know how many concurrent streams you can manage.

[21:34:51] <JEEB> there are encoders that definitely support it
[21:34:55] <JEEB> probably not by default
[21:36:11] <kepstin> do any encoders do the denoising and setting grain parameters internally? or is it something like you provide pre-denoised videos and tell the encoder to re-add grain?

[22:20:00] <emcodem> you mean like any ffmpeg encoders @kepstin or more in general?
[22:20:29] <kepstin> i'm talking about av1 encoders here, ffmpeg does not have an internal av1 encoder.
[22:20:59] <emcodem> sry, underestmated that question hehe
[22:23:00] <emcodem> well anyway, even without knowing the av1 standard, i'd guess that they
[22:23:40] <emcodem> didnt define anything about it in the standard, right?
