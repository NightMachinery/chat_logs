[00:01:57] <T`aZ> do you just want to say that im stupid ?
[00:02:08] <T`aZ> becase that I do understand
[00:03:22] <pissmechanics> no way you aren't stupid
[00:03:26] <pissmechanics> you had something in your eye
[00:03:28] <pissmechanics> and you got it out
[00:03:32] <pissmechanics> if we're inviting him back
[00:03:37] <pissmechanics> he has to know what he's getting himself into
[00:03:52] <pissmechanics> which is the funny bit to me
[00:05:12] <T`aZ> him = zharf ?
[00:05:21] <pissmechanics> nou
[00:05:24] <pissmechanics> i don't have zharf on fb
[00:05:27] <pissmechanics> just on steam
[00:05:29] <pissmechanics> that's a fb chat
[00:06:37] <T`aZ> im going to look again at some lto compilations goind on, to make it compile faster, instead of trying to understand what's going on in here
[00:06:58] <Renderwww> this is how we keep losing people!
[00:07:16] <T`aZ> cmake says i'm at 99% done
[00:07:50] <T`aZ> it obviously doesn't understand that linking with lto is taking nearly as much time as compîlation itself
[00:08:06] <pissmechanics>  he's coming to visit
[00:08:09] <pissmechanics> fwiw
[00:08:19] <pissmechanics> he didn't even know what network you guys were on
[00:08:22] <pissmechanics> heh
[00:08:29] <Faux> If you have LTO on then the linker is doing the vast majority of the "compilation", by execution time, so technically... who knows.
[00:08:55] * Faux waits for shit perf on shit ubuntu to shit itself again.
[00:09:10] <T`aZ> indeed, but lto compilaton produces .o that can be linked *without* lto linking, hence doing the real compilation anyway
[00:09:21] <T`aZ> which is not used by tle lto linking
[00:09:33] <T`aZ> i love to heat up the earth for nothing
[00:09:53] <Faux> I'm so lost.
[00:10:08] <Renderwww> at least you aren't running some kind of crypto scam
[00:10:16] <T`aZ> tldr : everything sucks
[00:11:07] <Faux> I have some code which is taking 23s to work out ~the unique values in a 130M item list of uint32_ts with a hashmap and I have no idea if that's slow or not.
[00:11:36] <T`aZ> i have a process here that is using 600GB is virtual memory
[00:11:45] <Faux> I'm also running Chrome.
[00:11:47] <T`aZ> 600GB , i mean, really, wtf
[00:11:52] <T`aZ> no, it's not chrome :(
[00:11:54] <Faux> Is it asan?
[00:12:03] <T`aZ> qbittorrent
[00:12:09] <Faux> Is it built with asan?
[00:12:24] <T`aZ> no clue, i would have to check the compile flags of the pkg
[00:12:24] <Faux> Or has it mmap'd all your 599GB of porn?
[00:12:46] <T`aZ> i'm sharing more than 600GB
[00:12:51] <T`aZ> that is not porn
[00:13:20] <T`aZ> s/ /, /2
[00:13:46] <Renderwww> nice try, there isn't 600gb of data in the world if you remove all the porn bits
[00:14:05] <T`aZ> damnit, busted
[00:14:16] <markuskj> is this some kind of bust
[00:14:31] <Renderwww> very busty
[00:20:28] *** Joins: bjank (~bjank@157-131-221-168.fiber.dynamic.sonic.net)
[00:20:55] <bjank> I've come for the free apple pies.
[00:21:14] <Faux> BJANK
[00:21:24] <Faux> You actually came for a conversation about linking and porn.
[00:21:25] <bjank> Fjaux!
[00:21:37] <bjank> We're still talking about porn?
[00:21:56] <bjank> It's been over 20 years. Can't we find another hobby?
[00:22:05] <Faux> We're talking about how great it is to live in a post-porn society?
[00:22:25] <Faux> Wait, am I the only parent here? Christ.
[00:22:35] <T`aZ> post porn, is that a thing ?
[00:22:41] <T`aZ> what about preporn ?
[00:22:46] <Faux> That was a thing.
[00:22:57] <bjank> Neo-porn.
[00:23:01] <T`aZ> are < 12yold no longer preporn ?
[00:23:01] <Faux> If you only include written or printed media as porn.
[00:23:09] <Faux> And post-written media as porn.
[00:23:36] <T`aZ> do we need another serbian film ?
[00:23:46] <bjank> The answer is yes.
[00:24:02] <T`aZ> omg
[00:24:16] <bjank> BTW, it took me half an hour to find an IRC dlient. I'm probably hacked.
[00:24:45] <Faux> I had a legitimate discussion like this week on whether all the classic shock sites were porn.
[00:24:58] <Faux> It's probably been five years since Ihad that discussion, what with us being a post-posting-porn society.
[00:25:01] <bjank> I think so.
[00:25:18] <bjank> Is anime still porn?
[00:25:26] <Faux> Also a question for the ages.
[00:25:55] <bjank> There's too many questions. I'll come back when there's answers.
[00:26:14] <bjank> Or a donut. Is there a donut?
[00:26:20] <Faux> No.
[00:26:37] <bjank> Christ. Now I don't remember why I joined.
[00:26:53] <Faux> 130e6/26s is like 170ns. What should I be able to do in 170ns?
[00:27:15] <bjank> Task switch to another thread.
[00:27:20] <Faux> That's the wrong way up.
[00:27:31] <bjank> Are we still talking about porn?
[00:27:53] <Renderwww> who is posting porn?
[00:28:08] <bjank> It's you, if you have to ask.
[00:28:21] <Faux> I'm doing an activity on saturday night using visual media; it's up to you whether it's porn or post-porn.
[00:28:25] <pissmechanics> wow
[00:28:30] <pissmechanics> bjank: kia ora
[00:28:41] <T`aZ> pics or your post or not porn id not happen
[00:28:46] <T`aZ> s/id/did/
[00:28:49] <bjank> You know what I hate? Configuring an IRC client because jotham's server doesn't exist anymore and I can't use irssi now.
[00:28:52] <Faux> (I'm writing RUST.)
[00:29:11] <bjank> I can't tell if that's good or bad.
[00:29:24] <Faux> This machine claims a random memory read of 64 bytes takes 50ns.
[00:29:25] <pissmechanics> bjank my friends are all on another network and we have heaps of linux machines, so that's a different problem
[00:29:33] <Faux> So 170ns isn't bad I guess.
[00:29:38] <pissmechanics> taz was invited but got booted for join part spam
[00:29:58] <bjank> I'm guessing this random person is jotham.
[00:30:00] <pissmechanics> in 2022 if you don't have a stable network connection in the developed world
[00:30:01] <bjank> Or porn.
[00:30:02] <Renderwww> https://anyporn.com/contents/videos_screenshots/52000/52867/preview_360p.mp4.jpg post porn
[00:30:08] <bjank> Is this random perosn jotham or porn?
[00:30:12] <Faux> :D
[00:30:17] <Faux> Took me a while.
[00:30:21] <Faux> bjank: Again, subjective.
[00:30:35] <bjank> I want answers.
[00:30:45] <Faux> That's not how philosophy works.
[00:30:50] <T`aZ> pissmechanics: yeah im sorry about that
[00:30:52] <pissmechanics> one channel: my kid will die from the plague
[00:31:00] <pissmechanics> another channel: we're all having a lark
[00:31:03] <bjank> How does something work when it doesn't have answers? This is not Bruce Lee.
[00:31:24] <Renderwww> it just becomes like water
[00:31:38] <T`aZ> the box in the street is getting flooded when it rains, and it rains often here, and i cant get it fixed without paying (maybe?) something, which is infuriating
[00:32:11] <bjank> Anger is second to porn.
[00:32:17] <Faux> T`aZ: We fix that problem by sshing into bjank's box.
[00:32:28] <bjank> Actually, anger wins over porn. People are more angry than horny.
[00:32:30] <Renderwww> has there been any technology invented yet to actually to tame the huge swarms of tabs that keep collecting in browsers
[00:32:42] <Renderwww> looking at ff extensions right now and they don't seem really helpful
[00:32:47] <Faux> Chrome is supposed to protect you against this, by getting oomkilled.
[00:32:57] <bjank> It use to be called bookmarks, but nobody knows how they work.
[00:33:01] <T`aZ> i loled
[00:33:22] <bjank> We have jokes, but do we have answers? Like where do I get a free donut?
[00:33:45] <Renderwww> thought of shoving everything in defferent multi-account containers, but that doesn't let you only show one group of tabs
[00:34:00] <T`aZ> in the garbage bags of the bakery ?
[00:34:07] <bjank> So, we were deciding on a game to play. My brother wonders why all my choices are from 2015.
[00:34:14] <Renderwww> ff profiles somewhat work but then you end up with multiple windows
[00:34:17] <bjank> Those were all the co-op games I played with Renderwww 
[00:34:47] <bjank> So we pick a game. After a day, I check the date. It was made in 2015. He picked it.
[00:35:08] <T`aZ> tfw the last coop game i played was from 1997
[00:35:18] <Renderwww> play monster hunter world, it'? from 2018
[00:35:23] <bjank> You are not a team player with answers.
[00:35:41] <T`aZ> s/1997/2000/
[00:35:58] <markuskj> is this some kind of bjank
[00:36:10] <bjank> njo.
[00:36:19] <bjank> Or yjes.
[00:36:33] <markuskj> cool
[00:36:39] <bjank> cjool.
[00:36:59] <markuskj> cjoop
[00:37:13] <bjank> I do love a good cjoop porn.
[00:37:49] <bjank> Wait, I also haven't played a good co-op porn since 2000.
[00:38:09] <markuskj> y2k disaster
[00:38:11] <markuskj> confirmed
[00:38:21] <markuskj> everyone acts like nothing happened
[00:38:25] <bjank> oh my god, it's true.
[00:38:52] <Renderwww> things were already bad before 2000
[00:39:12] <pissmechanics> hey bjank we got you in to fix the 2038 problem
[00:39:16] <pissmechanics> nothing else
[00:39:21] <pissmechanics> ignore markuskj's massive balls
[00:39:33] <pissmechanics> we need some free asian labour
[00:40:00] <bjank> Why are they massive?
[00:40:02] <bjank> again?
[00:42:16] <pissmechanics> uhm
[00:42:24] <pissmechanics> markuskj care to advise us on it
[00:42:58] <bjank> One thing I hate about the coorporate world is when someone ends their email with "please advise".
[00:43:17] <T`aZ> 21:20 <T`aZ> too much information
[00:43:56] <bjank> We're talking about his dispoable balls.
[00:43:59] <markuskj> pretty arrogant to say please instead of plz
[00:44:04] <bjank> The ones he uses for magic tricks.
[00:44:42] <bjank> Oh god, configuring an irc client takes forever.
[00:45:02] <T`aZ> why do we care, how do you know ?, take a room, what ? ok
[00:45:28] <bjank> I have no anwers for any of those questions.
[00:45:51] <pissmechanics> sort it out T`aZ 
[00:45:56] <pissmechanics> you're a seasoned player
[00:46:12] <pissmechanics> i always end my emails with kind regards,
[00:46:15] <pissmechanics> and no name
[00:46:26] <pissmechanics> also i've been blasted with so many american hr videos
[00:46:33] <pissmechanics> i think i have a nervous brain response
[00:46:44] <pissmechanics> it is a kind of radiation treatment
[00:47:15] <pissmechanics> i will never fault a person on email or in slack
[00:47:20] <pissmechanics> but i will call them physically
[00:47:28] <pissmechanics> and ask what the fucking hell they think they are doing
[00:47:32] <pissmechanics> and if they have ever used software
[00:47:35] <pissmechanics> or can write a program
[00:47:40] <pissmechanics> and can they fucking stand down
[00:47:41] <bjank> My corp is based in the UK, so the American HR videos have an accent.
[00:47:56] <pissmechanics> haha
[00:47:59] <pissmechanics> that's weird
[00:48:35] <bjank> They also talk about how they love everyone and we're all a family.
[00:48:49] <pissmechanics> fairly vulgar
[00:48:57] <bjank> So my coworker finds a better paying job and gives the two weeks notice.
[00:49:11] <bjank> They fired the person and gives them two days.
[00:49:24] <Faux> I think it's illegal here.
[00:49:32] <bjank> It's illegal here too.
[00:49:35] <Faux> I realise your country doesn't have laws.
[00:49:40] <pissmechanics> haha
[00:49:42] <bjank> But this is what you do to family.
[00:49:46] <MaNI> its worse when they end it with "please advice"
[00:49:48] <pissmechanics> laws are on paper not in practice
[00:49:50] <bjank> Again, my company is based in the UK.
[00:49:54] <Faux> Oh.
[00:49:59] <pissmechanics> hi MaNI 
[00:50:02] <pissmechanics> missed you
[00:50:16] <bjank> pissmechanics, I much prefer people who tell me to piss off.
[00:50:24] <markuskj> do they fire people in uk, or only sack
[00:50:31] <dukwon> lay off
[00:50:34] <Faux> Neither.
[00:50:34] <pissmechanics> MaNI is the only ingredient that is white that you can drop into a discussion about equality
[00:51:02] <bjank> Wait, I didn't mean to dismiss that America has no laws.
[00:51:04] <MaNI> please no equality discussions, 2022 is meant to be a nice year
[00:51:41] <bjank> My year hasn't been good so far.
[00:51:44] <pissmechanics> bjank: hard one, kiwis would tell you to piss off, to wind your head in, but not to sulk or actually piss off
[00:52:15] <bjank> pissmechanics, okay, then that's the same as please advise.
[00:52:20] <pissmechanics> :<
[00:52:26] <pissmechanics> bjank: i mean piss off
[00:52:45] <T`aZ> is piss still related to post porn era ?
[00:52:46] <markuskj> piss on m8
[00:52:46] <bjank> I get the flags wrong for piss. I end up with piss /on
[00:53:08] <bjank> We never answsered the question of what post porn era is.
[00:53:28] <Faux> We'll never know?
[00:53:38] <Faux> I wonder if e.g. North Korea has eliminated porn?
[00:53:51] <T`aZ> no one know
[00:53:53] <bjank> Can you imagine pre-porn? If you wanted porn, you had to wait for the alpha monkey to get the babes.
[00:54:09] <pissmechanics> you guys are thinking of this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortolan_bunting the 
[00:54:14] <markuskj> this is getting too scientific for me
[00:54:24] <bjank> SCIENCE OFF
[00:54:30] <pissmechanics> bjank: when iwas a kid we had no tv or internet and intermittent power
[00:54:41] <pissmechanics> bjank: i used to carve little women out of soap and wank to them
[00:54:50] <T`aZ> wat
[00:54:50] <pissmechanics> bjank: maybe society would be better if we still did that
[00:54:52] <bjank> pissmechanics, we had a library of porn in the basement.
[00:55:17] <pissmechanics> well T`aZ you could just collapse the bit of soap after your wank, so no sexual detail was exposed
[00:55:18] <T`aZ> i downloaded gif in 14.4kbps
[00:55:25] <bjank> I don't even know how we got it. The community of boys just collected it and made a library.
[00:55:32] <pissmechanics> i'm older than you T`aZ 
[00:55:36] <pissmechanics> i'm presently 42
[00:55:44] <T`aZ> indeed
[00:55:47] <pissmechanics> i was born before the internet
[00:56:11] <pissmechanics> bjank: wait a porn library?
[00:56:23] <bjank> Yes. Magazines and sometimes a VHS.
[00:56:24] <pissmechanics> that sounds highly dangerous
[00:56:36] <markuskj> remember when the youth could walk down the stairs without glued to a smartphone
[00:56:44] <Faux> s/youth/people/
[00:56:50] <pissmechanics> first time i got knocked out cold was by this guy i was trying to sell my mums weed to
[00:57:05] <Faux> ^ so much to unpack
[00:57:11] <pissmechanics> and then i gave this maori guy porn jpgs? gifs? was like 1993 so maybe gifs, on floppies
[00:57:12] <bjank> Slow down, buddy.
[00:57:15] <pissmechanics> to this massive maori dude
[00:57:23] <pissmechanics> and he was my body guard, and to this day my friend
[00:57:29] <Faux> https://www.reddit.com/r/BrandNewSentence/comments/fvynwf/my_cat_meatballs_hanukkah_sweater/
[00:57:31] <pissmechanics> i just gave him porn so i could sell mums pot
[00:57:35] <pissmechanics> was a good system
[00:57:42] <bjank> 1993 gifs have stopped wars.
[00:57:49] <pissmechanics> obv he was giant and punched a lot of people
[00:58:07] <pissmechanics> he's a bee keeper now
[00:58:11] <pissmechanics> i think that's very cute
[00:58:12] <bjank> I find it strange that you can sell weed and not have a porn library.
[00:58:21] <pissmechanics> go from high school thug to bee mechanic
[00:58:24] <pissmechanics> also a lovely guy
[00:58:28] <pissmechanics> just treated badly
[00:58:43] <bjank> Ah. I hate when that happens.
[00:58:45] <markuskj> i guess it would be cool to be a bee keeper
[00:58:54] <markuskj> could just sort the bees anyway you like
[00:58:56] <bjank> I know a bee keeper now.
[00:58:57] <T`aZ> you should write a book because that would never have happened here in this part of the world
[00:59:23] <pissmechanics> T`aZ: you know i lived in utretch/zootemere in the netherlands for 3 years
[00:59:27] <bjank> If I was 100lbs heavier, that would have been me.
[00:59:30] <pissmechanics> T`aZ: and it was a very weird depressing place
[00:59:36] <pissmechanics> T`aZ: so i half believe what you say
[00:59:44] <pissmechanics> T`aZ: even though you're belgian
[00:59:55] <bjank> I want a belgian donut.
[01:00:38] <ERROH> bjank <3 <3 <3
[01:00:46] <T`aZ> pissmechanics: dont confuse .nl and .be, it's not the same culture :o
[01:00:46] <pissmechanics> T`aZ: he're the thing i find weird
[01:00:56] <pissmechanics> T`aZ: new zealanders are very much colonial people
[01:01:00] <ERROH> heard you happy and you know it
[01:01:05] <pissmechanics> T`aZ: but we very much prefer european laws to american laws
[01:01:11] <T`aZ> no shit
[01:01:15] <pissmechanics> T`aZ: but europe where, all the new zealanders go to travel
[01:01:22] <pissmechanics> T`aZ: find europe very weird and broken
[01:01:24] <bjank> I haven't been happy since 2015.
[01:01:32] <markuskj> lucky
[01:01:40] <pissmechanics> T`aZ: so we're pro your guys system but also find your guys system very bad
[01:01:46] <pissmechanics> T`aZ: and that isn't an insult
[01:01:49] <bjank> Or had co-op porn since 2000.
[01:01:54] *** Quits: Juliu_ (~Juliu@2a02:810b:c640:3ec0:5984:7505:b3af:3ddb) (Quit: Quit)
[01:02:08] <markuskj> we're basically history channel
[01:02:20] <ERROH> jesus
[01:02:25] <ERROH> had wrong intel
[01:02:25] <T`aZ> bjank: it doesn't technically exist, some backery are trying to copy what the us are doing, but it's hard to find, as cooking bread in old is not common and stinks the whole place up
[01:02:35] <T`aZ> s/old/oil/
[01:02:37] <ERROH> how many jesuses do you know
[01:02:58] <markuskj> in biblical sense?
[01:03:21] <bjank> There's a place on this planet where cooking bread is old?
[01:03:33] <T`aZ> pissmechanics: tons of stuff are retarded/corrupted here indeed, that is not a secret.
[01:03:36] <bjank> Oh, oil.
[01:04:07] <pissmechanics> T`aZ: <3
[01:04:12] <bjank> ERROH, sadly, everyone's mental health is not great enough to know the truth about how horrible everything is.
[01:04:17] <markuskj> for readability put the s/ lines first
[01:04:20] <T`aZ> but still better than us/uk ?, probably
[01:04:45] <pissmechanics> T`aZ: well i come from the outside belt like you
[01:04:49] <pissmechanics> who knows
[01:05:00] <bjank> This is not a sci-fi movie.
[01:05:07] <pissmechanics> but it's very dumb when america or uk turns into a shitshow of introspective bullshit
[01:05:08] <bjank> You are not from the belt.
[01:05:11] <pissmechanics> while the planet burns down
[01:05:37] <bjank> In order to save the planet, you need new vegan shoes.
[01:05:41] <pissmechanics> also i'm quite sad the expanse is over
[01:05:44] <T`aZ> even if europe would be perfect, it still has little power compared to us/china and other bigger nations
[01:05:55] <T`aZ> i mean, to save the earth
[01:06:04] <dukwon> pissmechanics, why isn't kiwistralia like 2 feet underwater? https://i.redd.it/pfgn27o1aub81.gif
[01:06:13] <bjank> The USA only has the power to destroy.
[01:06:20] <bjank> Anger is stronger than porn.
[01:06:36] <ERROH> i've had this realisation on the second day of christmas just i was falling asleep
[01:06:42] <ERROH> that we are all going to die
[01:06:55] <ERROH> there's absolutetely nothing we can do about it
[01:06:57] <bjank> How many days of Christmas do you get?
[01:07:21] <ERROH> we didn't give up the boxing day to capitalism yet
[01:07:27] <pissmechanics> cause i was in love with bobby, christen, amos and drummer
[01:07:29] <ERROH> eastern europe and shit
[01:07:39] <bjank> Ah, nice.
[01:07:48] <ERROH> anyways
[01:07:58] <ERROH> i couldn't sleep for a couple of days after that
[01:08:07] <bjank> It occurs to me that the same dumb people who are destroying the planet will be the leaders of fixing it when it all goes to shit.
[01:08:12] <pissmechanics> dukwon: we're gelogically entirely different places
[01:08:20] <ERROH> and then it gave me the bliss of great, now i don't have to care about anything
[01:08:24] <dukwon> yeah but volcano
[01:08:29] <pissmechanics> dukwon: your primitive spatial reasoning has let you down
[01:08:41] <pissmechanics> dukwon: you mean the tongan volcano?
[01:08:45] <pissmechanics> it's a net positive for them
[01:08:46] <dukwon> yes
[01:08:54] <bjank> A volcano went off and I have a tsunami warning. I'm in San Francisco.
[01:08:56] <dukwon> can see that shit from space
[01:09:01] <pissmechanics> nz and au will rubber stamp tens of thousands of migrants
[01:09:02] <markuskj> volcano facts on the table, now
[01:09:06] <pissmechanics> something australia and nz don't do
[01:09:11] <pissmechanics> and they will survive climate change
[01:09:15] <pissmechanics> it's a good deal for them
[01:09:27] <pissmechanics> they are all force migrating into supermarket jobs in our two countries
[01:09:29] <bjank> ERROH, it's a problem for people under 20 years old.
[01:09:29] <ERROH> didn't you guys put immigrants into gas chambers or something
[01:09:32] <pissmechanics> their ancestors will be happy
[01:09:48] <ERROH> it's not a problem
[01:10:06] <ERROH> nothing matters at all
[01:10:11] <pissmechanics> anyway for serious
[01:10:17] <bjank> No
[01:10:23] <bjank> SERIOUS OFF
[01:10:26] <pissmechanics> both our armies iwll go pick them up and integrate them into our cultures
[01:10:31] <pissmechanics> it happens every storm seasn
[01:10:33] <markuskj> turn off all the things
[01:10:36] <pissmechanics> except now it's a volcano
[01:10:44] <dukwon> volcano season
[01:10:48] <bjank> VOCANO OFF
[01:10:55] <T`aZ> RTX ON
[01:11:04] <markuskj> why didn't they just unplug the volcano
[01:11:17] <dukwon> they forgot
[01:11:20] <ERROH> i mean
[01:11:23] <bjank> The power supply was invented by a UX expert.
[01:11:38] <ERROH> you could care about mortgage -> doesn't matter you're gonna die
[01:11:46] <T`aZ> ERROH: but like, all dying becaue natural death, or because chaos on earth ?
[01:11:59] <ERROH> you could care about your children future -> doesn't matter, they;re gonna die
[01:12:07] <pissmechanics> europeans don't find chaos natural aye
[01:12:08] <T`aZ> so chaos on earth
[01:12:09] <bjank> Chaos and natural death aren't the same thing?
[01:12:14] <pissmechanics> that's why americans freak out about socialism
[01:12:24] <ERROH> you could care about the plannet -> doesn't matter, it's gonna be engolfed by fire when sun goes super
[01:12:29] <bjank> I thought it was because they were dumb.
[01:12:45] <markuskj> is ERROH roleplaying zharf
[01:12:52] <T`aZ> ERROH: but that's in millions of years in the future
[01:12:59] <pissmechanics> he'd call himself zh0rf
[01:13:01] <bjank> It'll only take 200 years for the planet to fix itself after humans die.
[01:13:03] <ERROH> and then the universe gets one form of death or another once dukwon people decide which way it is
[01:13:06] <pissmechanics> out of respect
[01:13:06] <ERROH> NOTHING MATTERS
[01:13:17] <ERROH> bjank, that's even better news!
[01:13:22] <dukwon> we decide
[01:13:27] <T`aZ> \m/ AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERS \m/
[01:13:32] <pissmechanics> did u decide dukwon 
[01:13:37] <dukwon> not yet

[01:24:51] <pissmechanics> so i just moved cities right
[01:24:58] <pissmechanics> and looked on google at all the barber reviews
[01:25:02] <bjank> Why are you always moving?
[01:25:02] <pissmechanics> i went to one by a church
[01:25:06] <pissmechanics> hoping it'd be muslim
[01:25:10] <dukwon> i thought you lived in the woods
[01:25:11] <pissmechanics> cause muslims do good beards
[01:25:17] <pissmechanics> anyway it was catholic polynesian
[01:25:18] <markuskj> did you burn the bridge to the previous town
[01:25:20] <pissmechanics> and he did an amazing job
[01:25:27] <pissmechanics> used a razor which i haven't had in 4 years
[01:25:32] <pissmechanics> and finely sliced my face off
[01:25:34] <bjank> Wow
[01:25:36] <pissmechanics> was very good anyway
[01:25:48] <bjank> This is not the type of pissmechanics stories I expected
[01:25:49] <pissmechanics> i pay for my face to be groomed for it to be groomed well
[01:25:54] <ERROH> you clean shaved now?
[01:25:55] <markuskj> carved you into a beautiful pony
[01:26:01] <pissmechanics> i usually get a hard core muslim to do it
[01:26:06] <pissmechanics> cause i have a shaved head and a big beard
[01:26:10] <bjank> markuskj, that was beautiful
[01:26:12] <pissmechanics> it's a very discrete kinda cultural vibe
[01:26:20] <pissmechanics> naah ERROH 
[01:26:22] <dukwon> one time a barber trimmed my eyebrows without asking and i didn't like it
[01:26:29] <ERROH> hard core muslims make me think of oz hbo series
[01:26:30] <pissmechanics> shaved head to the line and shaved everywhere else but a big beard
[01:26:50] <pissmechanics> it was a big thing when i realised i was going bald
[01:26:51] <bjank> Why would anyone trim your eyebrows :O
[01:26:54] <pissmechanics> but have a tiny bullshit chin
[01:27:00] <pissmechanics> i had to get a beard and a shaved head
[01:27:03] <pissmechanics> for my sanity
[01:27:09] <pissmechanics> which is a big cultural statement
[01:27:15] <pissmechanics> but the muslims shave it best for me tbh

[01:49:16] <ERROH> it's really quite perverse
[01:49:28] <ERROH> we were discussing mice before you joined us
[01:49:47] <ERROH> at the farm i would remove corpses of mice from the traps i've set up
[01:49:55] <bjank> I stopped caring when I found out the buddishts were getting the muslims to kill the animals so they wouldn't feel guilt.
[01:50:01] <ERROH> because they would damage our harvest
[01:50:10] <ERROH> now i leave in a city and we have a pet mouse
[01:50:18] <bjank> Oh nice.
[01:50:29] <bjank> I had a blind squirell.
[01:50:38] <markuskj> :o
[01:50:39] <bjank> I think it got eaten in Octoboer.
[01:50:42] <markuskj> was it bblind like a bat
[01:50:50] <bjank> No, it had no sonar.
[01:50:54] <ERROH> punisher
[01:51:10] <bjank> The fucker kept eating the house.
[01:51:20] <markuskj> literally?
[01:51:28] <bjank> Yes. The support beams.
[01:51:38] <bjank> It was living on my balcony.
[01:51:45] <markuskj> cool
[01:51:51] <markuskj> cute way to crash to your death
[01:52:17] <bjank> One day it never came back from where ever it went 
[01:52:39] <ERROH> sure it wasn't a cat?
[01:52:43] <bjank> I had a hawk sit outside, waiting for the blind fucker to come out.
[01:53:05] <ERROH> getting confused -_-
[01:53:06] <markuskj> i don't think you can sell this story to disney
[01:53:14] <ERROH> speaking of blind
[01:53:21] <bjank> Could be a cat. 
[01:53:31] <bjank> We also have an owl.
[01:53:43] <markuskj> do you live in the woods
[01:53:50] <bjank> No, next to a park.
[01:55:54] <bjank> The owl was my favorite but the birds didn't like it.
[01:56:49] *** Quits: chris64 (~chris@user/chris64) (Quit: leaving)
[01:56:51] <bjank> The rat stopped coming by since I stopped feeding the squireel.
[01:57:07] <bjank> Now I have a useless camera.
[01:57:15] <ERROH> can't tell if you're bullshitting us now
[01:57:28] <markuskj> did you give honey to a beer
[01:57:29] <bjank> I'm sure I've posted this on Facebook.
[01:57:32] <markuskj> bear
[01:57:56] <bjank> We have no bears.
[01:58:05] <bjank> That I know of.
[01:58:19] <markuskj> bears may be to high maintenence
[01:58:29] <ERROH> i don't really facebook anymore
[01:59:06] <bjank> Anyway, what's stopping you from being vegetarian?
[01:59:07] <ERROH> i couldn't figure out how to see "friends" rather than "ads and pages your younger self wanted to see"
[01:59:22] <ERROH> physical health
[01:59:29] <bjank> Ah.
[01:59:36] <ERROH> that's a lie
[01:59:41] <ERROH> laziness
[02:00:02] <bjank> It's harder to do.
[02:00:03] <ERROH> i wouldn't care to balanse shite so i would just feel like shit after a while
[02:00:12] <bjank> Yeah.
[02:00:58] <bjank> I get cranky. My ex would feed me meat to calm me down.
[02:01:15] <bjank> I wouldn't notice it.
[02:01:53] <markuskj> nutrition is hard
[02:02:00] <bjank> It really is.
[02:02:09] <bjank> I found out I needed to eat more to ride my bicycle.
[02:02:23] <bjank> And it was mostly carbs. Not meat.
[02:03:55] <bjank> It made me feel so good eating carbs and riding.
[02:04:57] <ERROH> if we ever get out of the city we plan to bike the shit out of the plac
[02:05:10] <bjank> I hope it's an ebike.
[02:05:23] <ERROH> my mom has weird relationship with meat
[02:05:39] <ERROH> they were mostly vegan growing up
[02:05:40] <bjank> Meat is a weird relationship.
[02:05:58] <bjank> I don't understand being a vegan child. :O
[02:06:11] <ERROH> then meat became culturally luxury good
[02:06:37] <bjank> We grew up like that too, but we still ate bugs and stuff.
[02:06:41] <ERROH> so once she could actually afford it she would try and feed us meat every day
[02:06:50] <bjank> Ah.
[02:06:56] <ERROH> my mouse can't eat bugs, too much protein
[02:07:25] <bjank> I find it weird when animals have a better diet than me.
[02:07:52] <bjank> Mainly because humans eat like crap.
[02:08:12] <ERROH> you should see my concubine filtering bugs our of the mouse luxury fodder
[02:08:25] <bjank> Nice.
[02:08:34] <bjank> I'm glad you got a mouse.
[02:09:01] <bjank> I guess technically all my animals are outside.
[02:09:08] <bjank> I want to feed the rats, but they might come inside.
[02:09:50] <bjank> The small birds and humming bird will literally stare you down if you don't resupply the feeders.
[02:10:19] <markuskj> passive agressive
[02:10:39] *** Joins: Crocodillian (~Crocodill@comply.posixsh.org)
[02:11:02] <bjank> They'll sweep away the bits they don't like and eat the stuff they do.
[02:11:07] <bjank> So most of the food is on the floor.
[02:11:14] <bjank> And when it runs out, they peck the floor.
[02:11:37] <bjank> I don't think I like animals.
[02:11:44] <markuskj> i would do that if i knew what food is good
[02:12:00] <bjank> You're an animal and i don't like you.
[02:12:07] <bjank> I mean, okay, I do that too.
[02:12:34] <bjank> Anyway, I need to shower and go to work. I don't have days off anymore.
[02:12:43] <ERROH> bummer
[02:12:43] <markuskj> so long
[02:13:02] <ERROH> you know libera doesn't have limits or anything
[02:13:08] <ERROH> can alsywas idle and sthi
[02:13:23] <bjank> I've mainly not been on IRC because I forget.
[02:13:34] <ERROH> it's good to forget
[02:13:43] <ERROH> means other good stuff is important
[02:13:52] <bjank> I also haven't been playing games but started in November.
[02:14:21] <bjank> Half my life is just remembering that I have a mental illness.
[02:14:58] <ERROH> how do i respond to that
[02:15:16] <markuskj> glass half full
[02:18:03] <bjank> It's okay. I think most people have some form of mental illness.
[02:18:26] <bjank> Half my country is trying to do eugenics so they can go out to eat.
[02:18:39] <bjank> So that rich people don't suffer.
[02:19:08] <bjank> They're literally killing people so they can eat and support the rich.
[02:19:25] <bjank> I just decided not to go into work.
[02:19:59] <bjank> My boss has COVID and my coworker is useless. So I'm literally in charge of the IT team for 120 people all by myself.
[02:20:45] <bjank> Which means I have to deal with corporate, which is around 10K people, which is owned by a bigger company.
[02:20:57] <bjank> I'm not stressed at all.
[02:22:09] <markuskj> you superhuman
[02:22:54] <bjank> Or just dumb.
[02:23:42] <markuskj> they will all die though
[02:23:45] <markuskj> quotin someone
[02:24:00] <bjank> The funny thing is that I use to say that. I still do. :P
[02:24:33] <markuskj> doesn't work that good thinking about someone younger and annoying
[02:24:52] <bjank> You make me want to get a donut.
[02:25:12] <markuskj> i'd like a donut
[02:25:18] * markuskj pretends to be an animal
[02:25:29] <bjank> I wish you were an animal.
[02:25:44] <markuskj> thanks
[02:29:03] <ERROH> what time is that west coast
[02:29:05] <ERROH> 15?
[02:29:21] <ERROH> i won't judge an after lunch donut
[02:30:04] <bjank> Yes, 15.
[02:30:34] <markuskj> if europeans sign a petition for donut eating is it applicable there
[02:33:24] <T`aZ> we do not eat donut
[02:33:52] <bjank> In America, we have no laws.
[02:34:00] <T`aZ> it requires cooking the dough in fat, sinking up the whole bakery, which nobody wants to do, just to sell 4 donuts a day
[02:34:06] <T`aZ> stinking*
[02:34:37] <T`aZ> found that cooked donut in water instead, buuuuuut
[02:35:35] <ERROH> good that you're not stressed
[02:35:36] <T`aZ> so no. supermarket selling disgusting quality food are more likely to sell disgusting donuts
[02:36:29] <T`aZ> and finding properly americanly cooked (lol?!) donuts is mission impossible
[02:37:45] <ERROH> i like the version where everything cools down and eventually every atom decays

[04:44:42] <ERROH> T`aZ, 
[04:51:16] <pissmechanics> this omicron thing is weird
[04:51:25] <pissmechanics> my entire country just seems to be getting calmy ready
[04:51:32] <pissmechanics> talking about freezing meals
[04:51:38] <pissmechanics> what doctor stuff you should do now
[04:51:43] <pissmechanics> who to share childcare with
[04:51:45] <pissmechanics> etc
[04:51:47] <pissmechanics> it's very strange
[04:51:55] <pissmechanics> i think we just had confirmation it started today
[04:52:03] <pissmechanics> but the last two weeks we've just been trying to organise shit
[04:52:08] <pissmechanics> i think i have 2 months of food ready to go
[04:52:16] <pissmechanics> assume supply chains will collapse
[04:56:10] <dukwon> i've been running down some of the stockpile i made before xmas (in anticipation of having to quarantine for 2 weeks when i got back)
[04:56:26] <pissmechanics> yeah that's what i am most concerned about
[04:56:32] <pissmechanics> feeding myself for the 2 weeks i get omicron
[04:56:46] <dukwon> take an inventory
[04:56:53] <pissmechanics> i think between miso soup, frozen veggies, and air fryed chicken i'll be fine
[04:57:29] <pissmechanics> a friend gave me the state of the art air fryer as a house warming present
[04:57:33] <pissmechanics> i should really just sell it
[04:57:38] <pissmechanics> it's worth like 600-700 dollars
[04:57:41] <pissmechanics> which is a bit much
[04:57:52] <pissmechanics> i mean a bit of baked chicken is nice, but not a whole appliance, right
[04:57:58] <dukwon> i started with how much orange juice, milk, coffee and cereal i needed for 15 breakfasts
[04:58:15] <dukwon> then wrote down like 5 different meal recipes and tripled each
[04:58:17] <pissmechanics> i have porridge and coffee and make my own yogurt
[04:58:30] <pissmechanics> and have like a year of yogurt starter packets
[04:58:43] <pissmechanics> fresh produce is the main issue
[04:58:47] <dukwon> yeah
[04:59:00] <pissmechanics> milk, orange juice, tomatoes, spinach, spring onions, cabbage, broccoli
[04:59:19] <dukwon> i was prepared to eat tinned/pickled stuff for the first week until my student came back and could run errands for me
[04:59:27] <pissmechanics> haha
[04:59:43] <dukwon> i forgot about frozen veg tbh
[04:59:44] <pissmechanics> that's true i do know a few people in this city
[04:59:49] <pissmechanics> that could at least drop shit at my door
[04:59:51] <dukwon> i did freeze some bread
[04:59:51] <pissmechanics> if i got covid
[05:00:39] <dukwon> milk is all uht here so it's good for a few months if you don't open it
[05:00:45] <dukwon> same in france
[05:00:51] <pissmechanics> that's a good idea
[05:00:59] <pissmechanics> you know i only use milk for one thing
[05:01:02] <dukwon> orange juice lasts quite a while unopened
[05:01:08] <pissmechanics> i have a single coffee every morning and i like it with milk
[05:01:12] <pissmechanics> that's it
[05:01:37] <pissmechanics> can you get like the uht version of orange juice
[05:01:44] <pissmechanics> some kind of pulpy bullshit you can reconstitute
[05:04:10] <dukwon> never seen it before
[05:04:22] <dukwon> but this is what i usually buy, and it has a shelf life of like 8 months https://img.rewe-static.de/1279059/16339020_digital-image.png
[05:04:34] <pissmechanics> okay 8 mo is pretty good
[05:04:35] <dukwon> the cartons i have atm expire in july
[05:04:44] <pissmechanics> i am gonna hve a look
[05:04:59] <pissmechanics> nz is quietly getting ready for omicron aye

[05:05:17] <pissmechanics> like inevitable
[05:05:31] <dukwon> that fuckoff volcano not a problem?
[05:05:36] <pissmechanics> haha well
[05:05:41] <pissmechanics> lots of people including some of my friends
[05:05:45] <pissmechanics> are claiming they heard it
[05:05:50] <pissmechanics> which doesn't make any sense to me
[05:06:09] <pissmechanics> inverse square law and the distance of 2382km
[05:06:15] <dukwon> https://i.redd.it/duik2z2b5xb81.gif look at that shockwave
[05:06:16] <pissmechanics> seems quite unlikely imo
[05:06:23] <pissmechanics> yeah
[05:06:30] <pissmechanics> people say their cats and dogs all came inside
[05:06:56] <dukwon> i'm not sure it's 1/r² given the atmosphere has finite height
[05:07:34] <pissmechanics> seems weird to me
[05:07:50] <pissmechanics> all nz's volcanos have been upbeat too
[05:07:56] <pissmechanics> for the last week or so
[05:08:11] <pissmechanics> that's a very nice gif dukwon 
[05:08:21] <pissmechanics> can see the cyclone and also something else going on further east
[05:08:42] <pissmechanics> in french polynesia

[05:11:56] <dukwon> detected in switzerland
[05:12:16] <pissmechanics> do you know what time it was
[05:13:00] <pissmechanics> https://images.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/drums/latest/ouz-seismic-drum.png
[05:13:09] <pissmechanics> wonder if it's that 23h~ peak there
[05:13:16] <dukwon> i think about the time of the tweet
[05:13:49] <pissmechanics> okay 6 hours ago
[05:13:53] <dukwon> the eruption was at 4 UTC
[05:15:44] <pissmechanics> so 5PM yday, so yeah okay 22-23 hours ago
[05:15:53] <pissmechanics> that bump on the drums must have been it
[05:15:55] <dukwon> 16 hours to reach switzerland?
[05:16:10] <pissmechanics> here are all our drums https://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/drums
[05:16:21] <pissmechanics> but yeah check it out there are some def 22-23 hour ago peaks
[05:16:25] <pissmechanics> around the country
[05:16:32] <dukwon> nice https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=earth+circumference+%2F+mach+2
[05:16:34] <pissmechanics> near the top row of the charts
[05:16:35] <dukwon> indeed 16 hours
[05:17:01] <dukwon> stupid url encoding
[05:17:07] <dukwon> replace %2F with /
[05:18:26] <pissmechanics> yesterday i saw it on the news at 6pm, so must have been just after that explosion
[05:18:35] <pissmechanics> video from tonga etc
[05:20:12] <pissmechanics> yeah that's neat dukwon 
[05:21:36] <bjank> I just ate all my lockdown food.
[05:21:48] <dukwon> how much did you have?
[05:21:53] <bjank> I haven't had the energy to refill.
[05:22:09] <bjank> A lot of cans and pasta.
[05:22:27] <bjank> It's probably enough for two weeks or a month if I had to live that way.
[05:23:02] <bjank> Even during lockdown, I hadn't needed to touch my dry foods.
[05:24:23] <dukwon> i got quite a few packs of dried tortellini. one of them seems to have had a small puncture because it went mouldy in one corner
[05:24:38] <bjank> Nice.
[05:24:44] <bjank> You're ready for a fallout.
[05:24:56] <bjank> I don't even have instant ramen on me.
[05:25:40] <bjank> I really need to build up my inventory. Things are pretty bad.
[05:25:43] <dukwon> i figured out i have enough muesli for like 50 bowls
[05:25:58] <dukwon> similar with coffee
[05:26:09] <dukwon> don't need to buy any of those for a while
[05:26:25] <bjank> I stopped making coffee when I found out I was an adrenaline junkie.
[05:26:38] <bjank> So, I have a month's worth of coffee just sitting there.
[05:26:54] <pissmechanics> i have like 10kg haha of different kinds of dried legumes
[05:26:58] <pissmechanics> maybe 2-3kg of pasta
[05:27:03] <pissmechanics> probably 20 tins of tomatoes
[05:27:14] <pissmechanics> and my freezer is full of hens i've purcahsed and segmented
[05:27:16] <pissmechanics> into portions
[05:27:21] <bjank> Nice.
[05:27:39] <pissmechanics> been working on it for weeks
[05:27:42] <bjank> I'm in a sad state.
[05:27:46] <pissmechanics> cause i'm too poor to just go rush shit like that
[05:27:50] <pissmechanics> hugs bjank 
[05:27:53] <bjank> I opened my fish sticks today and it's filled with ice.
[05:28:13] <dukwon> prepping for an apocalypse in nz is a techbro trope
[05:28:17] <bjank> I have an old granny cart I take to the market. I have to take the bus.
[05:28:49] <bjank> I was riding my bicycle to the market for a while.
[05:29:13] <bjank> I didn't lose weight because I gained muscle.
[05:29:26] <bjank> But, I'm alas still poor.
[05:36:14] <pissmechanics> ahaha dukwon 
[05:36:16] <pissmechanics> sir
[05:36:28] <pissmechanics> we're oecd about on par with czechia
[05:36:31] <pissmechanics> in terms of wealth
[05:36:37] <pissmechanics> except we don't have europes supply chains
[05:36:46] <pissmechanics> but yes there are some horrible rich people that come here to bunker
[05:36:50] <bjank> Supply chains are nice.
[05:36:52] <pissmechanics> cause if you have 10 million to invest locally
[05:36:56] <pissmechanics> we give you a passport
[05:37:04] <dukwon> you speak english, how can you be as poor as slavs?
[05:37:08] <pissmechanics> so the techbro trope doesn't affect us normal kiwis
[05:37:18] <bjank> English is a poor man's language.
[05:37:19] <pissmechanics> far away, small, not very capitalist
[05:37:29] <pissmechanics> mostly export trees and cow milk
[05:37:37] <pissmechanics> primary industry, not secondary industry
[05:38:19] <bjank> I didn't buy your lamb because I didn't know what part to get.
[05:38:46] *** Quits: Fairy (~Fairy@2001:464a:4992:0:5181:5bae:9b9e:9cff) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[05:38:52] <pissmechanics> depends what you want to make with it
[05:38:58] <bjank> In half an hour, I'll be eating a piece of cow. I heated a pan, added olive oil and meat.
[05:39:03] <pissmechanics> my doc says i can't eat sheep or cow anymore
[05:39:07] <pissmechanics> so i've basically stopped
[05:39:16] <bjank> That's good. I'm going to die.
[05:39:29] <pissmechanics> i largely live on cabbage and legumes these days
[05:39:44] <pissmechanics> i get a free range hen regularly and segment it and freeze it
[05:39:52] <pissmechanics> which goes pretty good for stock and curries
[05:40:51] <bjank> Free range hen is damn delicous.
[05:41:12] <pissmechanics> yup
[05:41:18] <bjank> I started watching videos of people cooking outside like they're peasants.
[05:41:29] <pissmechanics> since i moved i can't cook outside anymore
[05:41:30] <bjank> And I realized that I like cooking outside.
[05:41:34] <pissmechanics> i used to mostly cook on my charcoal
[05:41:39] <pissmechanics> new place has no outside area
[05:41:40] <bjank> I wouldn't move if that was me.
[05:42:05] <bjank> I think the main thing is that I like hearing the food cook.
[05:42:18] <pissmechanics> yeah definitely
[05:42:38] <bjank> I have an electric stove I use on the balcony.
[05:43:22] <bjank> Today's meal wasn't planned.
[05:43:41] <bjank> But if I did, it would just be meat, vegetables rice, and salt.
[05:43:55] <pissmechanics> today i had defrosted beans and paprika on frozen/pan heated indian flatbreads
[05:43:59] <pissmechanics> with some yogurt
[05:44:07] <bjank> Fancy.
[05:44:17] <pissmechanics> been trying to buy a yogurt maker
[05:44:23] <pissmechanics> but everywhere has none
[05:44:28] <pissmechanics> supply chains are very fucked in nz
[05:44:59] <bjank> I bet.
[05:45:13] <bjank> It's been interesting here.
[05:45:22] <bjank> I bought my mom a sewing machine for Christmas.
[05:45:24] <pissmechanics> mersk has basically said we're an afterthought after australia
[05:45:33] <pissmechanics> and they are only keeping us supplied for good will reasons
[05:45:36] <pissmechanics> which is very strange
[05:45:39] <bjank> Yeah. I bet.
[05:45:52] <pissmechanics> did you get the sewing machine
[05:45:58] <pissmechanics> i heard californias port problems are easing up
[05:46:01] <bjank> I did, but it was the last one.
[05:46:18] <bjank> I saved something like $120.
[05:46:31] <bjank> If I sold it, I would get $20 more than I spent.
[05:47:02] <bjank> Amazon didn't warn that it was being sold out, so I suspect it had a lot.
[05:47:17] <aeplus> pissmechanics, definitely... i started hearing the trains again from my house
[05:47:35] <pissmechanics> trains reminds me of that qanon train driver in LA
[05:47:40] <pissmechanics> that smashed the train 
[05:47:44] <pissmechanics> to try get a ship?!
[05:47:50] <pissmechanics> fuck the last 2 years has been fairly wild
[05:47:58] <bjank> This month has been wild.
[05:48:01] <aeplus> yeah, been crazy
[05:48:05] <bjank> Today has been wild.
[05:48:30] <bjank> I've unfriended my anti-vaxx people and waiting for the rest to die.
[05:48:32] <aeplus> i'm trying to figure out a low calorie meal i can get at a restaurant
[05:49:07] <bjank> I'm too scared to go there for a low calorie meal.
[05:49:45] <aeplus> the fast spreading omicron variant does give me some concern
[05:50:21] <aeplus> ... people have kind of stopped doing the 6'/2m distance in lines at grocery stores
[05:51:45] <bjank> They're all nuts.
[05:52:29] <bjank> My friends are like "I'm scared to go out. Omicron is scary"
[05:52:43] <bjank> Same people: "Who is going to the Tool concert with me?"
[05:53:14] <bjank> Also, the same people: "I got covid. I'm okay. Staying home"
[05:54:53] <bjank> I do tech support for the company, so I have to help people at the office.
[05:55:11] <bjank> I get people who really really really need to work at the office or else.
[05:55:28] <bjank> Once I get them set up, they come for two days and then stay home.
[05:55:45] <bjank> They just needed the option to get away, but they don't really want to work there.
[06:12:19] <bjank> I forgot I had kimchee. My meal is saved.
[06:12:26] <pissmechanics> yeah okay the pressure wave got to NZ at 7PM local time, so 0600 UTC
[06:12:58] <pissmechanics> https://quad.pe/e/Vxogq4ZLxB.jpg
[06:14:14] <pissmechanics> mean while in nz we have a spinny boi off the coast
[06:14:17] <pissmechanics> https://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/surface/level/orthographic=-177.55,-37.95,3155/loc=179.925,-33.750
[06:14:18] *** Joins: Carbonflux (~Carbonflu@c-66-235-54-179.sea.wa.customer.broadstripe.net)
[06:14:19] <pissmechanics> it's luckily not very strong
[06:14:21] <pissmechanics> but quite pretty
[06:14:30] <bjank> Heh.
[06:14:55] <pissmechanics> i have white person kimchi
[06:14:57] <bjank> I think I'm starting to come out of my week depression.
[06:15:03] <pissmechanics> korean style but made by whites
[06:15:10] <pissmechanics> it's good though
[06:15:35] <bjank> I'm a fan of most kimchi. The only thing I don't like fermented is the white people juice. I forget what it's called. Koombachi or something.
[06:15:44] <pissmechanics> haha
[06:15:49] <pissmechanics> kombucha
[06:15:54] <pissmechanics> it's a tea that is used as a soda
[06:15:59] <bjank> Gross.
[06:16:03] <pissmechanics> i like it with tumeric and ginger
[06:16:10] <bjank> You would.
[06:16:12] <pissmechanics> haha
[06:16:16] * pissmechanics chuckles in white
[06:16:23] <pissmechanics> did you see i got my dna done
[06:16:24] <bjank> Not because you're white, but because you eat that stuff raw.
[06:16:26] <pissmechanics> i'm very white
[06:16:31] <bjank> No, I didn't see.
[06:16:50] <pissmechanics> https://quad.pe/e/ZuS5LvroMI.png + https://quad.pe/e/lG5eePsCiE.jpg
[06:16:58] <bjank> I'm eating a piece of meat that has salt.
[06:17:11] <pissmechanics> no french, no scandi
[06:17:13] <bjank> You probably ate a bean with tons of complicated spices.
[06:17:17] <pissmechanics> just britbong 
[06:17:34] <pissmechanics> is bay leaf complicated
[06:17:36] <bjank> Whoa. You're just boring.
[06:17:45] <pissmechanics> was paprika bay leaf onion garlic tomato and bean
[06:17:51] <bjank> No, but it probably had giner and tumeric.
[06:17:58] <pissmechanics> haha it didn't
[06:18:01] <pissmechanics> don't cyber bully me
[06:18:06] <pissmechanics> it had molassas though
[06:18:07] <bjank> You have failed me.
[06:18:12] <pissmechanics> i was trying to recreate the baked bean taste
[06:18:20] <bjank> mmm
[06:18:46] <pissmechanics> yeah i'm very britbong aye, it's good
[06:18:47] <pissmechanics> cheers me up
[06:18:58] <pissmechanics> means i can give racists a lot of shit
[06:18:59] <bjank> Speaking of which, I still have not had a good meal from an Instant Pot or Air Fryer.
[06:19:03] <pissmechanics> and bring the paperwork
[06:19:10] <bjank> haha
[06:19:22] <bjank> They hate it when you do that.
[06:19:32] <pissmechanics> haven't tried an instapot, i figure you can just use the stove like a normal person
[06:19:42] <pissmechanics> air fryer i definitely am thinking of selling, like i said, was given to me
[06:19:53] <pissmechanics> it's literally only good for chicken
[06:20:00] <pissmechanics> which i already know how to cook
[06:20:01] <pissmechanics> ...
[06:20:17] <bjank> There has got to be something else.
[06:20:23] <pissmechanics> potato
[06:20:27] <pissmechanics> but i don't really eat potato
[06:20:31] <bjank> XXX
[06:20:31] <pissmechanics> so waste of time for me
[06:20:38] <pissmechanics> i think if you had a family it might be a good idea
[06:20:40] <pissmechanics> cause it's very quick
[06:20:48] <pissmechanics> frozen food -> air fryer -> plate
[06:20:51] <pissmechanics> in under 20 minutes
[06:20:52] <bjank> Yes, when you need to feed them but not have them have flavor.
[06:21:18] <bjank> I had this coworker that went on and on about her chili.
[06:21:30] <pissmechanics>  instapot chili?
[06:21:32] <bjank> She preps it it two hours before she gets to work.
[06:21:40] <pissmechanics> okay
[06:21:43] <bjank> And it cooks at the office. We made a big deal out of it.
[06:21:53] <bjank> Only a few people were invited. There's not enough.
[06:21:56] <pissmechanics> i tried to look up what chili was, seems like beef mince and beans? very american thing
[06:22:04] <pissmechanics> haha
[06:22:09] <pissmechanics> that's bad juju
[06:22:18] <bjank> It turns out she didn't know how to cook.
[06:22:25] <pissmechanics> haha
[06:22:46] <pissmechanics> i used to watch 'lets play' on youtube right, and get mad that people couldn't even play the game they were showcasing
[06:22:46] <bjank> I like my chili without beans.
[06:22:51] <pissmechanics> the same xists with cooking videos
[06:22:56] <bjank> Yeah.
[06:23:02] <pissmechanics> i basically avoid american and brit cooks on youtube
[06:23:07] <pissmechanics> though i dunno if you know the guy
[06:23:09] <pissmechanics> the foodwishes guy
[06:23:12] <pissmechanics> he's quite good
[06:23:17] <bjank> I don't.
[06:23:22] <pissmechanics> he's from your part of the world
[06:23:31] <bjank> I've only  been watching poor people cook outside.
[06:23:33] <pissmechanics> John Armand Mitzewich, more commonly known as "Chef John", is an American chef known for publishing instructional cooking videos on the blog and YouTube channel Food Wishes, with over 850 million views on his channel.
[06:23:49] <bjank> Nice.
[06:24:05] <pissmechanics> weird i thought he was asian
[06:24:11] <pissmechanics> that's like a polish last name aye
[06:24:17] <pissmechanics> ALL ASIANS KNOW EACH OTHER
[06:24:22] <bjank> You know that we all have sex.
[06:24:31] <bjank> And sometimes it comes out polish.
[06:24:49] <pissmechanics> mum refuses to cook meat in her house now days
[06:24:56] <pissmechanics> says it's too gross
[06:24:59] <pissmechanics> does everything on her hotplate
[06:25:10] <bjank> Me too. That's why I cooked it outside.
[06:25:50] <bjank> After we started getting the wild fires and the sky turned orange, I like my inside air to be clean.
[06:26:16] <pissmechanics> yeah okay
[06:26:27] <pissmechanics> caitlin was talking about that quite a bit
[06:26:29] <pissmechanics> and josh
[06:26:33] <pissmechanics> they are both west coast
[06:26:36] <pissmechanics> seattle and san diego
[06:26:46] <pissmechanics> when australia burns down NZ gets amazing sunsets
[06:26:48] <pissmechanics> haha
[06:26:50] <pissmechanics> that's about it
[06:27:00] <bjank> The sunsets were amazing.
[06:28:02] <bjank> Oh man, that was rough. Depression is tough on the body.
[06:28:07] <pissmechanics> we're sending our army to tonga
[06:28:13] <pissmechanics> and are open to give them 10 million
[06:28:17] <pissmechanics> so that's not entirely shit
[06:28:19] <pissmechanics> see how it goes
[06:28:28] <pissmechanics> aussie will probably do the same
[06:29:07] <bjank> I'm sure it'll be helpful but not enough.
[06:29:08] <pissmechanics> bjank: how long was it
[06:29:15] <bjank> A week.
[06:29:18] <pissmechanics> mine usually only lasts a week but is cyclic, once every 5 weeks or so
[06:29:24] <pissmechanics> yeah sorry to hear
[06:30:28] <bjank> It's fine. Now I just need to wait for the next one.
[06:30:47] <bjank> My boss catching covid wasn't the best thing.
[06:31:21] <bjank> He's another person that goes out, doesn't wear a mask properly, and doesn't wash his hands.
[06:31:40] <bjank> And then wonders why he got sick.
[06:31:41] <pissmechanics> :<
[06:32:16] <pissmechanics> i just ordered a box of 50 n95 masks
[06:32:18] <bjank> The other guy told me that Nipal is doing okay because they eat a lot of garlic.
[06:32:24] <pissmechanics> me today though https://quad.pe/e/2igGJHhtUN.jpg
[06:32:47] <bjank> That's a nice shark.
[06:32:56] <pissmechanics> friends wife made me the mask cause i maoned none of them were any good with beards
[06:33:02] <pissmechanics> yeah it's neat
[06:33:11] <bjank> Ooooh, wow.
[06:33:17] <pissmechanics> my general position on masks is the following two ideas
[06:33:29] <pissmechanics> 1- they are to show you want to cooperate with society and aren't an asshole
[06:33:34] <pissmechanics> 2- they stop you spitting everywhere
[06:33:45] <bjank> Yeah.
[06:33:50] <pissmechanics> people that think they are to protect you, kinda have the wrong end of the stick
[06:33:53] <pissmechanics> and are possibly assholes
[06:34:09] <pissmechanics> humans spit a lot
[06:34:10] <bjank> You need a real mask for that.
[06:34:14] <pissmechanics> yeah 
[06:34:35] <bjank> Those fuckers are all over the spit guard at the buffet.
[06:34:40] <pissmechanics> i have 20 of those disposable surgical masks
[06:34:47] <pissmechanics> and 5 of these triple filtered masks
[06:34:55] <pissmechanics> but for daily life i just roll my sharky boy
[06:35:06] <pissmechanics> if you've seen the covid rates in NZ you can see there is basically none here
[06:35:16] <pissmechanics> we had 54 cases yesterday, 28 were in our immigration quarantine system
[06:35:18] <pissmechanics> it's very low
[06:35:33] <pissmechanics> seems as long as we follow the rules the virus basically can't function
[06:35:34] <bjank> Yeah. I still wear the cloth mask outside so I don't spit on people.
[06:35:37] <pissmechanics> but omicron i think is gonna fuck us
[06:35:48] <pissmechanics> delta is largely dead in nz now
[06:36:15] <bjank> They're seeing omnicron as a free vaccination.
[06:36:22] <pissmechanics> it's a bit of a farce sometimes, like i went to the dentist yesterday
[06:36:33] <pissmechanics> me the nurse and the dentist all had our masks off obviously
[06:36:38] <pissmechanics> and both right up in my face hole
[06:36:49] <pissmechanics> but we're all jabbed and boostered, i think that's the main thing
[06:36:54] <pissmechanics> like 94% in the region i live in
[06:36:56] <pissmechanics> of over 5's
[06:38:32] <bjank> We're doing eugenics.
[06:39:05] <pissmechanics> at the start of delta there was an accusation that polynesians were being ignored by the government
[06:39:11] <pissmechanics> with its very 'white' vaccination campaign
[06:39:22] <pissmechanics> so the government dumped money into polynesian community groups
[06:39:31] <bjank> Interesting.
[06:39:37] <pissmechanics> it's worked out well
[06:39:44] <pissmechanics> we don't want to do eugenics here
[06:39:54] <bjank> I don't even know what we're doing.
[06:40:03] <bjank> Blacks and Mexicans are at a high risk.
[06:40:22] <pissmechanics> https://www.health.govt.nz/sites/default/files/images/our-work/diseases-conditions/covid19/vaccine-data/uptake_mix_19.png
[06:40:29] <pissmechanics> still not ideal ^
[06:40:32] <bjank> I stopped paying attention since we're doing eugenics.
[06:40:45] <pissmechanics> i got pretty frustrated last year
[06:40:50] <pissmechanics> cause americans and brits kept saying
[06:40:54] <pissmechanics> 'nz can't close its borders forever'
[06:40:57] <pissmechanics> etc
[06:40:58] <pissmechanics> but the thing was
[06:41:03] <pissmechanics> we couldn't get any fucking vaccines
[06:41:07] <pissmechanics> cause all the rich countries had them
[06:41:15] <pissmechanics> was very dumb and annoying
[06:41:23] <bjank> Yeah.
[06:41:27] <pissmechanics> we didn't get any vaccine until october
[06:41:37] <pissmechanics> then the entire country promptly went to 90%
[06:41:37] <bjank> My mom watches the Thai news.
[06:41:39] <pissmechanics> so fuck off
[06:41:46] <pissmechanics> ohyeah
[06:42:02] <bjank> The guys who criticizes the vaccine got vaccinated.
[06:42:08] <pissmechanics> <extreme white voice> MADE AN AMAZING PAD THAI LAST NIGHT WITH TONS OF RED CABBAGE IN IT
[06:42:21] <bjank> And the ones that criticize the goverment for not getting it are ignoring that America took it all.
[06:42:35] <pissmechanics> yeah
[06:42:41] <bjank> But the real crazy thing is that this is still a scandal. It's not in America.
[06:42:54] <bjank> All the vaccinated people are telling their poor whites to not get  vaccinated.
[06:43:03] <pissmechanics> i think between trump and covid 19 and electing an old person to run your country
[06:43:09] <pissmechanics> the world has basically lost faith in america
[06:43:19] <bjank> I hope so.
[06:43:30] <pissmechanics> well okay i say that
[06:43:33] <pissmechanics> but look at this
[06:43:46] <bjank> I live in a country doing eugenics. I don't really believe the world.

[06:44:36] <bjank> Yeah.
[06:44:46] <pissmechanics> our antivax movement includes maori sovereignty and pro trumpers????
[06:45:01] <pissmechanics> why the fuck would trumps ideology give a sweet fuck about maori sovereignty
[06:45:04] <pissmechanics> it's very weird and broken
[06:45:11] <bjank> No kidding. Breaks me.
[06:45:40] <bjank> At most, that white guy got people arrested.
[06:46:03] <pissmechanics> weirdly i think for nz
[06:46:06] <pissmechanics> lots of it is just sexism
[06:46:13] <pissmechanics> so much of the hate directed at our pm
[06:46:19] <pissmechanics> even from my right wing foreign friends
[06:46:21] <pissmechanics> isn't about socialism
[06:46:30] <pissmechanics> it's about how we're ruled by a woman
[06:46:34] <pissmechanics> it's very strange and bad
[06:46:37] <bjank> It is scary.
[06:46:50] <bjank> Next you'll need to give women stuff.
[06:47:04] <pissmechanics> next they will get to choose if they clean the oven or the bench first
[06:47:18] <pissmechanics> i dunno, growing up poor with just my mother and sister
[06:47:27] <pissmechanics> i think calibrated my brain a bit differently to these arseholes
[06:48:02] <bjank> I don't get the women that want to be held back.
[06:48:10] <pissmechanics> oh come on
[06:48:16] <pissmechanics> that's totally understandable
[06:48:24] <pissmechanics> same reason guys join the army or whatever
[06:48:34] <bjank> If she has the nuclear code, what if she's on her perisod!
[06:48:35] <pissmechanics> for a lot of humans a basic set of rules is a massive relief
[06:48:47] <pissmechanics> not a stigma or suffocation
[06:48:48] <bjank> Yes, but power is nice.
[06:48:54] <pissmechanics> least you know the rules so you can behave within the rules
[06:48:58] <pissmechanics> no mental stress
[06:49:01] <pissmechanics> guys and girls both do it
[06:49:19] <bjank> Well, this is why we're in a pandemic.
[06:49:20] <pissmechanics> but 100% agree that shouldn't be the expected norm
[06:49:48] <bjank> And why some moari dude is hanging out with Trump.
[06:50:24] <pissmechanics> well i think that's a way deeper more fascinating problem than left wing america are prepared to entertain
[06:50:40] <bjank> There's no left wing.
[06:50:48] <pissmechanics> but you could simplify it as; the system isn't working for me, so damn the consequences, lets do a wild card
[06:51:08] <bjank> The left is also running around doing eugenics.
[06:51:13] <pissmechanics> well
[06:51:19] <pissmechanics> your democrats are nz's right wing
[06:51:26] <pissmechanics> tory neolib whatever bullshit
[06:51:37] <pissmechanics> that's literally our center right government
[06:51:37] <bjank> Everyone is either rich or poor.
[06:51:41] <pissmechanics> your democrat party
[06:52:01] <bjank> Rich people with stocks.
[06:52:02] <pissmechanics> i'm glad we have a mixed system like european countries
[06:52:15] <pissmechanics> but our green party just fucked up at cop
[06:52:25] <pissmechanics> so everyones now going, are the socialists the only lefties left
[06:52:28] <pissmechanics> and they have no power
[06:52:42] <bjank> Oh man.
[06:52:42] <pissmechanics> cause the greens are beholden to american style identity politics
[06:52:46] <pissmechanics> not environmentalism
[06:52:59] <pissmechanics> they'd rather worry about a syrian war bride
[06:53:02] <bjank> The house of cards has fallen.
[06:53:03] <pissmechanics> than the planet dying
[06:53:44] <bjank> I think the people want to deal with these problems but the politicians don't.
[06:54:21] <bjank> People are doing eugenics. They can handle hard issues.
[06:54:24] <bjank> Okay, maybe not.
[06:57:05] <bjank> I need to order N95 masks. I found one that was recommended and it keeps getting sold out.
[07:02:42] <pissmechanics> do you have to go on site for work?
[07:02:49] <pissmechanics> i've been working from home for 7 years now
[07:02:52] <pissmechanics> it's very lonely
[07:02:53] <pissmechanics> i hate it
[07:02:59] <pissmechanics> was before the pandemic
[07:03:02] <pissmechanics> i dunno what to do about it
[07:03:08] <pissmechanics> i'm useful, i don't have to be anywhere
[07:03:10] <pissmechanics> etc
[07:18:20] <bjank> I go onsite often.
[07:19:14] <bjank> I can social distance at the office. It's scary but not too bad. I get sick if I take the public transportation.
[07:19:42] <pissmechanics> have you had covid yet
[07:20:09] <pissmechanics> it's so rare here it's unicorn shit
[07:20:19] <pissmechanics> but i look at american case numbers
[07:20:39] <pissmechanics> i genuinely wonder if we can just be a hermit kingdom
[07:20:43] <pissmechanics> i think lots of people here do
[07:20:50] <pissmechanics> come in if you wait 14-20 days
[07:20:54] <pissmechanics> but sure come visit
[07:20:55] <bjank> I don't know.
[07:21:43] <bjank> I assume I've gotten it at this point.
[07:23:50] <bjank> I really hate working from home.
[07:24:13] <bjank> It's how I got mentally ill in the first place.
[07:24:43] <bjank> I mean, I can do it for 7 years without thinking but I didn't realize I went crazy.
[07:33:29] <pissmechanics> hey serious question
[07:33:33] <pissmechanics> i have to find a new job
[07:33:44] <pissmechanics> i'm highly skilled in a bunch of unregulated contexts
[07:33:52] <pissmechanics> but also have no like amazon cert or whatever
[07:34:01] <pissmechanics> but i've been fixing and writing software for 2 decades
[07:34:10] <pissmechanics> i think i need to change jobs
[07:34:14] <pissmechanics> do you have any advice
[07:34:58] *** Joins: Fairy (~Fairy@2001:464a:4992:0:5181:5bae:9b9e:9cff)
[07:40:21] <bjank> Yes. Find a job.
[07:41:06] <bjank> I don't know how to find one. I have failed my job interviews for the last 20 years.
[07:42:40] <bjank> I don't think that people know how to hire.
[07:43:03] <bjank> The ones that did pass the interview process ends up being fuckwits.
[07:46:14] <pissmechanics> yeah it's scary aye
[07:46:20] <pissmechanics> epsecially as we age
[07:46:46] <bjank> Well, age won't affect me. I was screwed when i was young too.
[07:47:01] <bjank> Certs aren't hard to get though. Just takes too much time.
[07:47:44] <bjank> The last guy I competed with had twice the resume and twice the certs.
[07:47:48] <pissmechanics> okay
[07:48:01] <pissmechanics> i am now at the gateway of just getting certs
[07:48:05] <pissmechanics> and it's scary to me
[07:48:07] <bjank> The last I saw, he had to move around because he couldn't keep a job.
[07:48:09] <pissmechanics> i dunno how to do it
[07:48:34] <pissmechanics> i can literally run your isp, your business, or your back office
[07:48:38] <pissmechanics> but i have to get a cert
[07:48:42] <bjank> All the dummies do it. I can't tell you how to be a dummy.
[07:48:44] <pissmechanics> i know how every dumb thing works
[07:48:50] <pissmechanics> it's very weird
[07:48:56] <bjank> Seriously.
[07:49:20] <bjank> I'm working with cert people all the time.
[07:49:56] <bjank> So my company is owned by this huge company that owns, let's say 60 corporations.
[07:50:13] <bjank> And they are also owned by a company that owns most of the ad agencies in the world.
[07:50:21] <bjank> NOT A SMALL COMPANY
[07:50:35] <bjank> So they bought the lease for an entire floor.
[07:50:59] <bjank> And hired a few IT people to do desktop support.
[07:51:09] <bjank> I can not qualify to get this job.
[07:51:19] <bjank> But I actually do more than they do.
[07:51:20] <pissmechanics> :<
[07:51:32] <pissmechanics> to be fair
[07:51:36] <pissmechanics> you're fucking up
[07:51:46] <bjank> What. So are you.
[07:51:49] <pissmechanics> and i don't know the providence of it
[07:51:55] <pissmechanics> naah i mean
[07:52:04] <pissmechanics> every job i've had since i was 20
[07:52:10] <pissmechanics> was because of people i knew
[07:52:18] <pissmechanics> not any fantasy about corporations
[07:52:19] <bjank> Me too.
[07:52:39] <bjank> I have this job because of people I know. I failed the interview.
[07:52:48] <bjank> It took them a year to figure out they wanted to hire me.
[07:53:07] <pissmechanics> wont that surely translate
[07:53:22] <bjank> Not if people can't figure out talent.

[07:53:59] <bjank> As far as I can tell, IT people are just a bunch of liars.
[07:54:27] <bjank> There's this contractor who is really good at networking.
[07:55:18] <bjank> Like he can set up the Internet for a company of 10K people, every month.
[07:55:32] <bjank> He can't get hired.
[07:57:44] <bjank> I hung out with the dev people and make nerd jokes they don't get. :(
[07:58:20] <bjank> Like that one time I made a knock knock joke about paralellism. It was out of order and they didn't laugh.
