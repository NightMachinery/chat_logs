[22:43:49] <Preston> whats the plan
[22:43:49] <c355e3b> don't deal with register allocation, just use the c preprocessor to fake it and look for a magic 64 bit assignment to r2
[22:44:03] <c355e3b> this can't possible go wrong at all
[22:44:15] <Preston> just write it in assembly
[22:45:03] <c355e3b> that is an option
