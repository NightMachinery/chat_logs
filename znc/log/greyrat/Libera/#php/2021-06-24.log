[00:52:31] <Byteflux> so I haven't kept up to date much, but are PHP strings still just a character sequence of bytes or is a character potentially larger than a byte?
[00:52:54] <TinoDidriksen> Still bytes, luckily.
[00:53:10] <Byteflux> nice, that's good. thanks :D
[00:53:25] <__adrian> Byteflux: your question is a little confused though
[00:54:04] <__adrian> "a character sequence of bytes or is a character potentially larger than a byte"  // (a) i don't know what a "character sequence of bytes" is  (b) yes
[00:54:28] <__adrian> i mean, i think you know what you mean, but just in case...
[00:55:07] <Byteflux> i understand semantically that a character can be larger than a byte, i just mean as far as string representation goes. $str[0], $str[1] etc if it's just essentially byte array
[00:55:40] <__adrian> [0],[1], etc. are byte indexes

[00:59:21] <Byteflux> let's say you're writing a large string to a stream and you want to buffer your writes or doing non-blocking writes so you have to buffer, is there a more efficient way to do this other than substr()? im guessing this basically creates a copy
[01:00:09] <physikoi> I'm using `Tracy\Debugger::log(..)` and, after combing through the docs, there doesn't seem to be a way to format the output to the log file. Namely, what I'd like to see if filename and line number. Can this be done? I'm very pleased with everything else tracy does in the browser. ty

[01:01:29] <TinoDidriksen> Byteflux, you can open the long string as an in-memory stream and use https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.stream-copy-to-stream.php
[01:02:29] <Byteflux> ah, that's perfect! thanks :)
[01:06:19] <da_wunder> physikoi: what about using monolog and then just pass that extra information to it? that might be possible with that logger that you're already using - dunno
[01:07:48] <da_wunder> physikoi: just tried that out with monolog so `$logger->info('jee', [__FILE__ . ':' . __LINE__]);` will log `[2021-06-23T20:34:46.233219+00:00] app.INFO: jee ["/app/src/Controller/IndexController.php:33"] []` - and that should do the trick - right?

[01:34:10] <physikoi> Code structure question. I like to keep my controllers free log statements. So, I will generally use throw and catch where called. Something I've struggeled with is how to efficiently handle error messages for users and error messages for devs simultaneously. Example: https://hastepaste.com/view/cMDG  Is there a better pattern for handling end-user and dev messages simultaneously?

[16:13:25] <olle> PSS would be interesting to track in the team. But maybe too personal.
[16:14:05] <olle> You could track it per month and sync with how the Scrutinizer score changes ^^
[16:20:56] <__adrian> some companies have regular "hey how's it going" meetings between devs and the dept head (note, not necessarily the direct supervisor). how honest (and thus, how useful) that feedback would be depends on how much the employee trusts their boss, though  :)

[17:30:42] <__adrian> (1) don't learn wordpress (2) yes, you need to learn before you do, but you certainly can't wait until you've "learned everything" to try applying things.
[17:31:41] <arash> __adrian, I love wordpress, why not ?
[17:32:18] <__adrian> well, if you need to know wp, that's fine. but don't learn wp expecting it to teach you anything about good ways to write code.
[17:32:56] <__adrian> "i need to work with wp code" ok, learn wp.  "i need to learn how to write code" no, don't look at wp.
[17:33:28] <__adrian> even in the former case, i'd highly recommend knowing how to do good code _before_ trying to specialize with wp.
[17:35:30] <da_wunder> yeah, wp is not good example - imho

[17:40:52] <__adrian> my granddaughter doesn't want to learn to crawl because she loves "walking" - but this also means she can't go anywhere without an adult holding her upright.
[17:41:23] <biberu> that analogy :D
[17:42:22] <arash> __adrian, I'm doing it. i know the basics almost for all of them, i mean i can handle things or i know how to find what i need, the problem is my needs for know and learn more and more, and i want it very fast ! so i want to handle this problem, i mean at least finding a good ways to achieve this
[17:43:17] <__adrian> it's even worse with code. she'll eventually learn to walk just fine, even if she does end up skipping the crawling. but with code, you just trick yourself into thinking that you've "already learned it" and it often ends up preventing you from growing.
[17:43:37] <__adrian> "i want it very fast!"  go slow. that's how you go fast.
[17:44:03] <__adrian> if you go fast, you trip and fall and run into trees. that slows you down.

[19:07:17] <arash> __adrian, what do you think about learning laravel ? I mean what if instead of focus on wp i practice and learn laravel ?
[19:07:29] <arash> is it better ?
[19:10:36] <AllenJB> Laravel is a popular general framework in companies (tho what's popular in your location may differ). WordPress (the core of which is a CMS / blog) is more often used for smaller sites (people to crazy things with plugins, most of which I would suggest are not really advisable)
[19:12:27] *** Quits: tex (~super@user/dix) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[19:12:46] <AllenJB> With Laravel, I would say: Be wary of "learning Laravel" rather than "learning PHP with Laravel". Laravel provides a lot of magic and wrappers that can, IMO, "lock you in" to the framework. You may want to consider learning PHP first (perhaps using a microframework such as Slim), then moving to Laravel
[19:13:19] <arash> AllenJB, yes, but __adrian suggested me don't work with wp, I want to ask does he has same look about laravel ?
[19:15:29] <Naktibalda> at the end of your day it is your choice, Wordpress is currently very popular and there is a lot of work for it. Laravel is very popular too.
[19:17:02] <AllenJB> WordPress, in a similar sort of vein, is (I would say) "bogged down" in old practices. They avoid breaking backwards compatibility and try to keep compatibility with very old PHP versions that few others use (certainly on new projects / latest framework versions).

[19:17:20] <Naktibalda> I'm not familiar with Wordpress, but I would think thad Wordpress projects are about adding features to Wordpress, and with Laravel you can expect to have some greenfield projects where you build application from scratch.

[19:18:32] <harpia> One thing frameworks really teach you is best practices. The problem is that when you need to build something simple, you tend to overcomplicate it. I had trouble building a simple CRUD in a job interview because of this - it took too long. That made me start learning the basics of PHP and forget a bit about frameworks... but at least at that point I already knew the best practices.

[19:21:17] <AllenJB> At the end of the day I don't think that there's really a straight-forward answer to a general "which should I learn?" You need to define some goals for what you want to achieve and then set learning goals based on that.
[19:27:21] <Naktibalda> arashL if you learn the latest version Laravel, you will learn some modern practices and features of PHP added in 7.4 or even 8.0 . With Wordpress you will learn how PHP projects were coded 10+ years ago.

[20:11:42] <__adrian> arash: my advice about "do not "learn php" by learning wordpress" holds for any framework/cms/etc..
[20:11:58] <__adrian> "learning laravel" does NOT teach you how php works.
[20:12:15] <da_wunder> ^
[20:12:21] <da_wunder> first learn the basics
[20:12:25] <__adrian> you need to know php first. then, you can learn the things written in php.
[20:13:05] *** Joins: NoiseEee (~NoiseEee@178.128.153.219)
[20:13:23] <da_wunder> and how to start that you start with simple "application" like blog - first do that with pure html + css + js - then start to introduce PHP to that to make that dynamic and so on
[20:16:08] <arash> __adrian, ok, i start reading phptherightway book that Naktibalda introduce, i think at least i know what to do for next few days.
[20:17:25] <__adrian> phptherightway is good but not necessarily for beginners. if there's something you don't understand right away, just keep it in mind for later

[20:35:25] <__adrian> arash: if you think you're ready, go ahead and read it, sure. what i'm saying is that, if it doesn't seem to make sense, then just remember it and come back later once you've learned even more.
[20:37:32] <arash> __adrian, uhum, I always use your advices, thank you
[20:38:02] <da_wunder> I would just recommend to start to do "something" (that could be blog, or anything) from pure html+css+js first, so content is static - then start to refactor that "content" to be dynamic - imho simple blog is quite good with this
[20:38:40] <da_wunder> but __adrian has also point there, blogs can be complex - so __adrian do you have some simpler application in your mind where to start?
[20:38:49] <stenno> todo app
[20:39:20] <stenno> blogs can be complex,  but they can also be really easy
[20:39:58] <stenno> i guess auth being the complex part of it
[20:40:31] <arash> da_wunder, my php knowledge is more than css/js , if i want to start doing that i will have some problems in css/js parts
[20:40:36] <da_wunder> I would not even introduce auth stuff there - just fetch that blog data from database in first step
[20:42:12] <da_wunder> arash: and css/js stuff is quite common that devs needs to know nowadays - also try to understand that it's quite hard to know what knowledge you've - I haven't seen any of your code - so cannot really say anything about that part
[20:42:44] <arash> at least i look at php codes for few years, but about css and js i'm a beginner, some parts of css is really hard for me
[20:44:31] <Blondie101010> if you need to improve your CSS knowledge, then you should focus on that part separately....  same goes for implementing and troubleshooting

[20:44:52] <Blondie101010> PHP won't change how CSS rules get applied
[20:46:40] <arash> for the conclusion i skip learning wp and laravel for now and focus on php js and css. thank you all
[20:47:52] <da_wunder> and when you start with wp and laravel, just remember that there are other frameworks too eg. Yii, Symfony and so on
[20:52:48] <Blondie101010> also note that you don't *need* to write bad code to use a bad platform
[20:53:07] <__adrian> "you don't *need* to write bad code to use a bad platform"   ← ABSOLUTELY
[20:53:22] <__adrian> but trying to _learn_ from bad code isn't going to help you write good code.
[20:54:13] <__adrian> "arash> some parts of css is really hard for me"  learn about how settings cascade. this is _critical_. nothing else matters if you don't understand this.
[20:54:23] <__adrian> but as blondie says, it's got nothing to do with php.
[20:54:56] <__adrian> "da_wunder> I would not even introduce auth stuff there - just fetch that blog data from database in first step"  // yeah, this would be a good way to start.
[20:55:38] <__adrian> re: simpler applications: todo lists are a good one. they're approachable but leave a lot of room for feature development.
[20:56:30] <__adrian> but the important thing is that you have a clear idea in your mind, and it's _one_ concrete idea (contrast: "todo list" vs. "my own framework")
[20:57:09] <Blondie101010> in most cases, I consider that learning SQL and DB design is the first step
[20:57:29] *** Joins: BadAdviceCat (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat)
[20:57:33] <__adrian> depends where you want your focus to be
[20:57:59] <Blondie101010> not really, but it's probably not appealing to learn in the beginning
[20:58:33] <__adrian> as with everything, if you're going to be working with {x}, you need to learn about {x} first
[20:59:02] <__adrian> and most php coders will work with DBs sooner or later. but jumping straight into them is probably not best
[20:59:53] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi how are you sir?
[21:03:23] <arash> what do you mean by "you don't *need* to write bad code to use a bad platform"
[21:04:17] <Blondie101010> the framework could be very disorganized, but that doesn't force you to write disorganized code to work with it
[21:04:17] <entuland> interestingly enough, I was just in the middle of this talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn0aFEMVTpA where Uncle Bob described how they deferred implementing the DB part of a wiki system as long as they could until they didn't implement it at all for the way they implemented the rest, and a guy that needed it to run on a DB could just plug it in on their own :P
[21:04:50] <Blondie101010> entuland:  well I disagree with him
[21:04:58] <entuland> 1hr 39min in the talk
[21:04:58] <Blondie101010> most apps are data-driven
[21:05:12] <entuland> oh sure, I was just thinking about different approaches
[21:05:16] <Blondie101010> so the focus should start on the data design
[21:05:31] <entuland> it's not like they didn't use data models or the alike, they just decoupled it
[21:08:14] <Blondie101010> commonly people don't know much about DB design and just learn by example to just use a ORM and patch things up to do what they want, and build on that, until a few months later they need to redesign everything because it gets very inefficient or even inconsistent when it gets real data
[21:10:30] <entuland> actually, the spot I was in was 1:48, at 1:39 there is a big rant about DBs in general

[21:10:34] <__adrian> to be clear, i'm not arguing against blondie, except the part about it being the first step to learn. i.e., when you're just starting out, learn about how to write your code, and don't worry about the storage layer. even if your app _will need_ a db, write the business logic as though there's no such thing.
[21:12:12] <da_wunder> that storage layer could be in the start just simple array like; $posts = [['id' => 1, 'title' => 'foo', ...], ...];

[23:44:11] <JohnDoe2> Hey guys, there's no such thing as an ignore path setting for xdebug right? Using vscode and tried the ignore in launch.json but it just doesn't give a flying *star* about the paths I put in there.
[23:47:12] <JohnDoe2> maker of xdebug references the setting here https://github.com/xdebug/vscode-php-debug/pull/66 but the official documentation doesn't mention it.
