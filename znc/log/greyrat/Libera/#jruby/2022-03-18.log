[00:11:19] <headius> byteit101: The code snippet above is a simple reproduction but running the specs in spec/ruby/language/string_spec.rb should report as well
[01:29:57] <byteit101[m]> headius: thanks. I think I see the problem. will open new PR after dinner
[02:08:38] <byteit101[m]> headius: new PR created https://github.com/jruby/jruby/pull/7150 Turns out I left in an extra increment that was now a duplicate (see last commit in that PR for the change)
[02:08:43] <byteit101[m]> Tests kicked off...
[02:29:33] <byteit101[m]> how concerned with the 8 failures should I be?
[02:44:33] <headius> Ugh logger update regressed some stuff
[02:44:44] <headius> byteit101: probably not your issue
[02:45:12] <headius> This is not too surprising since I didn't update logger tests along with the gem
[02:46:30] <byteit101[m]> cool. I rebased the commits on top so it should be a fast forward if you think the new PR is fine
[02:49:05] <headius> Yeah I will take a close look this time and fix up my logger regressions before we go ahead
[02:49:22] <headius> Thank you, I'm glad and not too surprised that it was just an increment out of place
