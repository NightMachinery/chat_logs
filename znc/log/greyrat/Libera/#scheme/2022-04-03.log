[10:11:31] <amazigh> ty
[10:12:06] <amazigh> imo, I did not experiement with a scheme repl as daily driver
[10:12:28] <amazigh> replacing bash.
[10:12:59] <amazigh> but I read CL people use their REPL quiet often for stuff that other PL use some kind of sh
[10:13:43] <amazigh> lockywolf: maybe it is worth look at CL, e.g. quicklisp.
[10:19:07] <gwatt> amazigh: do you know if the CL people make use of reader macros for that? One of the issues I usually see with replacing shell with something else is that the replacement is not usually as good as an interactive language
[10:22:59] <amazigh> sorry gwatt, I reply to say idk or i do not understand the question, and I do not know how to help but link to https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/ :)
[10:23:28] <amazigh> apparantly, they interact with the CL installation from the REPL, instlalingg package on the filesystem, and loading them from the REPL.
[10:23:44] <amazigh> I do not know, whether they use that to e.g. start firefox.
[10:24:47] <amazigh> another thing I do not know, is how they can do the equivalent of `grep` to find where some function is used, or defined.
[10:26:06] <amazigh> My use of bash can be summarized as: cd ~/src/scheme/arew && arew repl; and then in another terminal: emacs -nw
[10:26:34] <amazigh> otherwise, I rely on the Desktop Environment or Window Manager to start other gui apps.
[10:27:23] <amazigh> I am not sure what is specific to bash ui / ux except the pipes, and what ChoHag mentioned about SIGCHLD is alien to me
[10:28:55] *** Joins: badkins (~badkins@136.56.92.199)
[10:29:11] <ChoHag> SIGCHLD is sent to process when one of its child proceses does something interesting, like quit.
[10:29:18] <ChoHag> to a process.
[10:30:10] <amazigh> we definitly need a wiki to record those kind of questions, but they go beyond the mere R7RS project.
[10:30:32] <amazigh> ChoHag: isn't it what (system "firefox") does?
[10:30:42] <amazigh> system is non standard.
[10:30:48] <ChoHag> It's part of the process of making that happen.
[10:31:02] <ChoHag> There are ways to correctly ignore SIGCHLD.
[10:31:30] <amazigh> btw the unixy stdin / stdout is questioned and rework in some shell, maybe that is oil shell.
[10:31:34] <ChoHag> To fork and let the kernel/init deal with the new process is pretty simple.
[10:31:49] <ChoHag> Ah yes then you get to file descriptors.

[10:37:30] <lockywolf> I actually once wanted to make an srfi for (system).  Because it's so simple, and at the same time could allow to do a giant number of things portably
[10:38:02] <lockywolf> like making a gui toolkit (bindings to tk)
[10:41:10] <amazigh> there is jcowan process context, https://github.com/johnwcowan/r7rs-work/blob/master/ProcessesCowan.md
[10:41:13] <ChoHag> It's simple for fire-and-forget processes but if you even want to do something like detect if the executable was not found complications start to gather.
[10:41:48] <amazigh> I dare the ask you to make PR or issues in jcowan repo
[10:42:10] <amazigh> or fork that .md and fix stuff :)
[10:42:46] <amazigh> or post start a the topic to srfi-discuss or wg2 google group.
[10:42:50] <amazigh> or even codeberg.
[10:43:05] <amazigh> we discuss a lot on the IRC channel, but that is not recorded.
[10:43:24] <amazigh> the pre-srfi org used to help with that, but it is ghost town now
[10:45:19] <amazigh> no?
[10:46:00] <ChoHag> It says "very preliminary" and it looks OK for that.
[10:46:57] <lockywolf> no-no, proper process management is a completely different beast
[10:47:09] <lockywolf> (system) makes sense even on non-multitasking OSes
[10:48:28] <lockywolf> as the lowest common denominator
[10:48:30] <lockywolf> frankly speaking, I'm not a big fan of POSIX anyway
[10:48:36] <lockywolf> processes should be functions, not sui generi objects
[10:49:35] <lockywolf> and should return values, not exit statuses
[10:49:37] <lockywolf> by default at least

[10:49:41] <ChoHag> They are, as much as something conceptually running "over there" can be.
[10:50:04] <ChoHag> You fork, the thing execs if it wants, eventually it calls exit and the process gets an integer back through wait.
[10:53:31] <ChoHag> (A thread is basically the same except it can't or shouldn't exec and it can trample all over your memory).
[10:53:52] <amazigh> lockywolf: what is sui? otherwhise +1 on process should be process, and should return values

[10:55:18] <lockywolf> no worries
[10:56:08] <amazigh> ok
[10:58:35] <amazigh> idk what to do replace bash with a Scheme REPL, where the common unix utility commands are scheme function returning values.
[10:58:52] <amazigh> I know how, but it is a large project, see daviid post from earlier
[10:59:51] <amazigh> and possibly processescowan is not about making unix tools available as functions, but more like how to interop with existing unix tools

[14:31:40] <mdhughes> System stuff like mount, etc. I'm not going to rewrite. But any file or text processing, that's legit to be written and added to my toolkit.

[19:35:36] <dpk> hmm, R7RS doesn't guarantee that symbol names will be allowed to start with . (presumably because you might mean the pair .), but i'm not sure if any implementations actually forbid it in practice
[19:36:57] <dpk> i've tested Chez, Gambit/Gerbil, Guile, and Chibi with the expression '(.x) and all of them create a 1-list with the symbol R7RS formally requires you to spell |.x| as its only element
[19:37:27] <dpk> i guess more interesting would be a test like '(x .y)
[19:40:15] <dpk> meanwhile, it does guarantee that you can start a symbol with :, but as i documented in my keywords review, implementations where keywords have prefix colons break this
