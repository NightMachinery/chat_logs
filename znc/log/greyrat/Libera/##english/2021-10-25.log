[15:08:33] <daoudr> I am going through this now https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffold_(programming)
[15:09:33] <ychaouche> daoudr: scaffolding in programming is a metaphore of the building industry where you put structures around a building so that construction workers can climb on it and do their work
[15:10:14] <ychaouche> daoudr: in programming it's the amount of secondary/auxiliary work needed to perform the primary/essential/useful work
[15:10:43] <ychaouche> for example : creating mockups for tests is usually considered as scaffolding.
