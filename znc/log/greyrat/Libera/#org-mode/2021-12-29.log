[00:00:22] <asus> BerntH, Would you mind showing me what the end result looks like ? (not the haircut ^^)
[00:00:53] <BerntH> I don't book a haircut appointment in org - I just go and mark the habit done after I am done
[00:01:01] <BerntH> and it moves forward 6 weeks
[00:01:06] <asus> I see
[00:01:17] <BerntH> after 8 weeks it's pretty obvious I'm late for my haircut :)
[00:01:37] <asus> Yeah, haircuts are automagic :)
[00:01:52] <asus> but if I don't mark the dentist I might really well forget it 
[00:02:11] <BerntH> for an appointment to do something (like call the dentist, go to the dentist, etc) I would use separate tasks
[00:02:35] <BerntH> I don't like collecting stuff forever in a repeating event
[00:03:06] <BerntH> when I have long repeating events I normally clone them annually
[00:03:11] <BerntH> and reset the history
[00:03:32] <BerntH> like 'weekly review' repeats every monday forever
[00:04:27] <asus> "call" the dentist" and "go to dentist" are 2 separate tasks already. The first is recurring ++1y, and has the TODO tag + the SCHEDULED tag. Each time I call the dentist, I mark it DONE and it swithces to NEXT. This is GOOD
[00:05:19] <BerntH> ok - but go to the dentist moves around alot and isn't at a fixed time every year - I would use separate tasks for the go tot he dentist part - then you can keep notes on whatever you want for individual events

[00:06:17] <BerntH> if you are collecting "go to the dentist" tasks annually then it'll be awhile before you have too much stuff there -- I archive the stuff that isn't useful anymore
[00:06:26] <BerntH> and find it in the archive if I really need to reference it

[00:07:08] <asus> Problem is with "go to dentist" : once I have an appt, I mark it in a timestamp like this, <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> : As you said, it does NOT repeat because their is no periodicity obviously. 
[00:07:53] <BerntH> and you mark it TODO until you've gone and mark it done?
[00:08:04] <asus> yes
[00:08:12] <BerntH> then next year when you call the dentist to create a new "go to the dentist" task whenever that appointment is

[00:09:41] <asus> next*
[00:09:53] <BerntH> I create a new TODO heading for the next appointment
[00:10:01] <BerntH> or use a SCHEDULED timestamp instead of a plain one
[00:10:09] <asus> and when I do that, obiously, all the "go to dentist" events in the agenda become "TODO", even the one from last year

[00:10:42] <BerntH> you can log when DONE state occurs
[00:10:54] <BerntH> and keep that in a drawer so it is out of the way 
[00:11:13] <BerntH> and then you don't need to keep the old timestamps for previous appointments
[00:11:20] <BerntH> you can also log when the SCHEDULED date changes

[00:15:15] <BerntH> was a TODO scheduled for Jan 1, then I marked it DONE, then TODO again and rescheduled it for Mar 1
[00:18:54] <BerntH> does that help?
[00:19:32] <BerntH> If you use active timestamps it'll show up in your agenda, you could also change your old active timestamps to inactive
[00:19:51] <BerntH> shift up/down arrow on the < changes it to [ and back again

[00:24:52] <asus> i'm checking it BerntH 
[00:26:10] <unmatched-paren> the ox-man.el file seems to use .TP in a couple of places, but only to support certain org features, and not standalone... i'd presume, since this is emacs, that there is some way extend org to add new syntax?
[00:26:34] <unmatched-paren> actually...
[00:27:22] <unmatched-paren> (org-man-item) mentions it standalone, but i'm not sure how to get to that point
[00:28:14] <asus> BerntH, I understand wht you did, but I guess you manualy wrote the timestamp at the bottom right ? I'm precisely looking for a way to avoid that
[00:28:30] <asus> In fact, I want to avoid writing the same thing, this is couter productive
[00:29:37] <asus> I want to avoid writing "go to dentist" each year as well as writing "<date of the appointment>" a second time for logging purpose
[00:30:41] <asus> But apparently, the standard way to use org is to forget about old events ?
[00:31:49] <BerntH> no
[00:32:01] <BerntH> the timestamp at the bottom was created by a hook when I created the task originally
[00:32:13] <asus> what ??
[00:32:14] <BerntH> I didn't enter anything manually in the contents
[00:32:22] <asus> what do you call a "hook" ?
[00:33:07] <BerntH> (add-hook 'org-insert-heading-hook 'bh/insert-heading-inactive-timestamp 'append)
[00:33:18] <BerntH> or it came from a capture task as part of the template
[00:33:54] <asus> and what happens when you mark the march 1st task as DONE ?
[00:34:21] <BerntH> when I hit C-S-RET I get a new TODO task with the timestamp created by the hook
[00:35:46] <BerntH> http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html#InsertInactiveTimestamps
[00:35:48] <asus> C-S-RET : is it the same as mrking something DONE ? (I use C-c C-t d)
[00:36:07] <BerntH> control shift return - creates a new TODO task for me
[00:36:38] <asus> and what happens when you mark the march 1st task as DONE ?
[00:36:51] <BerntH> does the above link work? I just reset my firewall IP a few hours ago so it may not resolve yet

[10:23:12] <epony> the size is a problem, indeed, it directly affects processor operations and memory activities take time, so size is a problem, what makes it worse is the concurrent operation of multi-tasking operating systems and complex methodologies to secure and improve systems functionality
[10:24:22] <epony> an application that operates as a large memory block that does complex internal operation instead of being resizeable set of programs, is worse in any comparison by a modular-composable compact and separate process (for throughput) system, for example email server suites of applications

[10:25:43] <epony> a single large application running as a virtual machine that overtakes and replicates part of the tasks of an operating system in userland is inefficient, and considered large and slow, by interactive use in combination with many other programs competing to the scarce resources
[10:26:24] <epony> so yes, it is large, and can be smaller and faster, work must continue, you can not declare solution by comparison with other systems that are designed for throughput and transactions
[10:26:52] <epony> being naive and self reassuring are not the best choices to improve that
[10:28:33] <epony> the best features are the programmability, the worst feature is the tight bundled monolithing process model with degrading interactivity on larger documents and multiple open buffers
[10:29:53] <epony> there is a lot to learn from email servers, you can't just "claim superiority" without actually being the best example of a modular-composable application that benefits fully from the system capabilities and is 'exemplary' and 'maximum' efficiency for throughput and concurrency
[10:32:37] <epony> you can always make things worse by stacking a virtual machine underneath it, but can you make things better by removing contention and weight of large bulk processes and implementing a robust concurrency and throughput model of running editor buffers (and more)
[10:34:54] <epony> think again, large application construction is not always slow or the problem, the real problem is doubling system activities in userland and not using the system provided capabilities and functionality natively

[17:21:34] <asus> hello, everyone
[17:21:54] <asus> BerntH, I replicated your experiment from yesterday
[17:22:02] <asus> please check it out https://paste.chapril.org/?82b4697251ffabe1#CuW7WUojTnsFzBynmi9KzJYKCfsSQZSpaCcQd8piKDDm
[17:22:27] <asus> As you can see, I don't get the inactive timestamp automatically
[17:23:52] <asus> I could add it with : (add-hook 'org-insert-heading-hook 'bh/insert-heading-inactive-timestamp 'append)
[17:24:12] <asus> But I'm afraid it would be of no help for wht I'm trying to achieve
[17:24:49] <asus> For the record, I'd like to keep  log of the original date/time of my previous appointments
[17:25:39] *** Quits: jlrnick (~josephler@42.118.113.78.rev.sfr.net) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[17:25:45] <asus> In your example, there are only timestamps. Timestamps are great to answer the question "when did I act on this TODO item ?"
[17:26:21] <asus> But they can't tell you "you had an appointment at the dentist on 2021-12-12 9:30
[17:27:02] <asus> Is there really no way in org-mode to keep a log of your appts date/time ??
[17:28:36] <asus> i.e. To quote your example again, once you marked your event scheduled for 01/01, there remains no traces of it
[17:29:37] *** Quits: trocado (~uiop9@bl18-243-251.dsl.telepac.pt) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[17:44:16] <davemq> The LOGBOOK drawer can track various state changes, but I don't know if there's a way to have it log schedule changes
[17:46:23] <asus> davemq, I don't want it to track schedule changes, I just want it to track the scheduled date, before it is marked DONE
[17:46:51] <asus> it's not a timestamp, but the date of your previous appointments
[17:50:23] *** Quits: stef204 (~stef204@user/stef204) (Quit: WeeChat 3.4)
[17:54:17] <davemq> Yes, but you might be able to do something with org-log-reschedule to log the previous date before the change. Reading the code it seems like it would record the old date
[17:57:46] <davemq> Yep, just tried it. I rescheduled an event by adding an hour to it, and it logged what the old period was:
[17:57:53] <davemq>      :LOGBOOK:
[17:57:53] <davemq>      - Rescheduled from "[2021-12-30 Thu 07:00-18:00]" on [2021-12-29 Wed 08:26]
[17:57:53] <davemq>      :END:
[17:57:53] <davemq>  
[17:58:22] <davemq> So if you did multiple reschedules you'd have to walk back to find the originally scheduled time

[21:40:17] <asus> davemq, org-schedule effectively triggers the schedule. Same as C-s. But it does not REschedule
[21:40:40] <BerntH> sure it does - just change the state

[21:40:49] *** Joins: pwolf (~pwolf@user/pwolf)
[21:41:30] <BerntH> if you log schedule changes and use C-c C-s to schedule the item it logs the old date when it changes

[21:46:28] <BerntH> and finally to Jan 4
[21:47:16] <BerntH> and I log state changes so if it gets marked DONE that is logged to (and if you change it back to TODO that is also logged)

[22:52:24] <NotThatRPG> asus: Thanks!  I did miss it.
[22:53:20] <asus> you're welcome
[22:53:28] <asus> BerntH, Do I have to issue a particular command ? C-c C-s and org-schedule only trigger a regular "SCHEDULED"
[22:55:09] <asus> now about in your latest example here : https://paste.chapril.org/?af102c07a1b8519e#EkX4wv6aCNiUKWS2uRaChg2rTK3BS4e6pzdZHbLAHVo7
[22:56:11] <asus> When you reschedule an item, does the original date/time of the event disappear from the genda view ? I could not reproduce it but I bet it does, because the term "reschedule" imply a new date for the same event
[22:56:14] <davemq> asus: Try setting org-log-reschedule to 'time. You might also need to be logging into a LOGBOOK, that's some other variable
[22:56:24] <NotThatRPG> I just looked at the org manual, and it suggests that prefixing my block with #+ATTR_LATEX: :float t should make it float, but when I did that had no effect on the output latex file. source code block still just in verbatim
[22:57:26] <davemq> NotThatRPG: My source code blocks are inside a lstlisting environment, at least with C source code.
[22:57:33] <asus> davemq, thing is : does rescheduling an item moves it from date A to date B in agenda view ?
[22:58:08] <NotThatRPG> davemq: Mine are #+BEGIN_SRC lisp, and just come out in verbatim.  I should check and see what org-mode I'm running...
[22:58:40] <davemq> "reschedule" is just calling "org-schedule". I don't know what happens to agenda view, I'd assume you'd have to save the file and then reinvoke the agenda view
[22:59:22] <asus> i.e. If I schedule an appt on march 1, it shows in the agenda on march 1. Now if I REschedule it for March 3, where does it show in the agenda ? 
[23:00:12] <davemq> I don't know, you'll have to try it
[23:00:37] <asus> all right !
