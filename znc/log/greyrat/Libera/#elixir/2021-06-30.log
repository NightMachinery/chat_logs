[00:31:35] <Ankhers> Yeah, I have tried using it projects in the past, but it can be hard to setup to work the way you want it to. And then like you said, security issues because I don't know better when modifying code.

[00:54:59] <Guest6465> hello, any idea on how I could get an absinthe subscription published to all kubernetes replicas of an elixir app? Right now for example if app/replica 1 subscribes to 'commentUpdated' and a comment is updated on replica 2, replica 1 won't notice it

[02:01:53] <hoppity> If I am listing all my users in a template (sort of like index) is it better to preload associations in the template as I iterate or preload the desired associations "in bulk" in my context?
[02:02:03] <hoppity> By better I mean faster

[02:09:07] <mouseghost> hoppity, nah, it was a question about what you mean
[02:09:36] <hoppity> mouseghost, so in a template you may have a for comprehension to display all your "profiles" let's say right?

[02:10:26] <hoppity> mouseghost, as you are iterating over those profiles in the for comprehensions you could preload any other data associated to said profile right there from the template. Or you could preload inside your context specifically inside your list_profiles function with |> preload
[02:10:56] <mouseghost> oh hell, this is some elixir stuff D:
[02:10:57] <benwilson512> Guest6465: you either should setup your nodes in a cluster, or use one of the other Phoenix pubsub backends like Redis
[02:11:04] <mouseghost> i thought it was more of databases question
[02:11:15] <hoppity> oh I see haha
[02:11:19] <benwilson512> mouseghost: templates should be pure, they should never make DB calls

[02:11:33] <hoppity> benwilson512, thank you, that makes sense

[02:15:43] <Guest6465> benwilson512 would I need to do some configuration in the app's source code for the pubsub or does it work by itself if the nodes are in a cluster?
[02:16:44] <benwilson512> Guest6465: if you form an erlang cluster with the nodes, the default pubsub will simply work, no additional configuration required
[02:17:13] <benwilson512> however you'll probably need to make some changes to the app's source code in order for it to form that cluster, eg adding in libcluster
[02:17:45] <benwilson512> if you're using kubernetes I highly recommend libcluster with the Cluster.Strategy.Kubernetes.DNS strategy

[09:59:22] <serafeim> hello friends
[09:59:31] <serafeim> i'm once again furious about the scrivener html thing
[09:59:49] <serafeim> look at this: https://github.com/mgwidmann/scrivener_html/issues/99
[10:00:54] <serafeim> so 44 people were fvcked by this package. thats 44 people that are angry at the elixir community 
[10:16:29] <serafeim> for some reason upgrading an phoenix project is very diffuclt. i'm messing with the project for like an hour now and when i fix something something else breaks
[10:17:56] <serafeim> i'm now done with the deps (i think) and when i try to start the project i get this error: https://dpaste.org/jdq9
[10:17:59] <serafeim> any idea ?
[10:18:40] <Nicd> looks to be from Ecto
[10:18:41] <serafeim> the file it mentions (repo.ex) is just this: https://dpaste.org/QcKc
[10:18:55] <serafeim> Nicd: maybe it is because of the scrivener macro there ?
[10:21:10] <Nicd> maybe, did you update it?
[10:22:14] <serafeim> yes
[10:24:11] <Nicd> if you remove the scrivener line from the repo, does it compile then?
[10:26:49] <serafeim> hm no the problem seems to be with the `use ExAudit.Repo,`
[10:26:56] <serafeim> but the ExAudit package was *just* updated
[10:28:31] <serafeim> ah the new ex audit version needs a different config now
[10:32:51] <serafeim> now the app starts but i get this warning: https://dpaste.org/zuun
[10:32:54] <serafeim> any idea ?
[10:33:21] <Nicd> did you follow the instructions?
[10:33:41] <Nicd> it tells you what to do
[10:35:24] <serafeim> what instructions
[10:35:38] <Nicd> did you read the warning?
[10:35:59] <serafeim> these https://gist.github.com/chrismccord/e53e79ef8b34adf5d8122a47db44d22f#pubsub-20-changes ?
[10:36:04] <serafeim> no i did not read anything
[10:36:21] <serafeim> i had a phoenix 1.4 app and needed to ugprade it to 1.5 because erlang 24 does not support some shit
[10:36:38] <Nicd> the warning
[10:36:39] <serafeim> this is not something i wanted to do
[10:36:44] <serafeim> but now i am fuvked
[10:36:47] <Nicd> then don't upgrade to Erlang 24
[10:37:01] <serafeim> i can't keep my server from receiving upgrades
[10:37:23] <Nicd> if you used mix releases, you would not need to use system Erlang
[10:38:28] <Nicd> the warning is about the "PubSub 2.0 Changes" section in that gist, same thing
[10:39:06] <serafeim> Nicd: i can't use mix releases because i'm using windows
[10:39:20] <serafeim> ok i fixed the warning about pubsub
[10:39:32] <Nicd> can't help with windows 🤷
[10:39:37] <serafeim> ha ha
[10:40:16] <serafeim> the thing is that i had to do some things about another app. but now i've lost more than 1 hour with this
[10:40:21] <serafeim> and i still have things to do
[10:40:27] *** o is now known as niko
[10:40:41] <serafeim> because now i need to do the udpate layouts stuff https://gist.github.com/chrismccord/e53e79ef8b34adf5d8122a47db44d22f#update-your-layouts
[10:41:15] <Nicd> feels like you've dug your own grave here
[10:42:27] <serafeim> ok that was also fixed

[10:52:39] <serafeim> that was not my favorite thing to do though
[10:53:15] <Nicd> it's what happens when you upgrade your server software willy-nilly
[10:53:53] <serafeim> what else could i do
[10:54:03] <serafeim> i tried to postpone it as much as possible
[10:54:10] <Nicd> get a server that you can control
[10:54:24] <serafeim> i can control my server but i can't leave it without upgrades
[10:54:52] <Nicd> sounds like you don't have control over it then
[10:55:52] <serafeim> well not upgrading my server is not my idea of control
[10:56:21] <Nicd> it's not all or nothing. you can just leave Erlang on the 23 branch which is supporte
[10:56:44] <serafeim> yes i know what you mean but this ain't so easy
[10:57:04] <serafeim> i don't want to fine-tune the repos 
[10:57:24] <serafeim> i've got the erlang centos repo. if it upgrades to erlang 24 then the update will be installed
[10:57:53] <serafeim> i don't want to do research on how to keep on some specific erlang version. after all i *will* need to update some time
[10:58:04] <Nicd> thus, "feels like you've dug your own grave here" :P
[10:58:24] <serafeim> yes maybe you're right i guess

[19:33:21] <Ankhers> Anyone familiar with the internals of :gen_tcp? Is recv an expensive operation? If I call recv and get a small number of bytes at a time, would that be as efficient as grabbing all of the current bytes and just keeping track of what extra bytes and only calling recv when I need more data?

[19:43:24] <jeregrine> Ankhers: in my experience if its a serious perf consideration they'd make note of it in the docs. if your usecase is sensitive to this you'll probably need to test your case

[19:57:39] <mayhew> Ankhers: I was wondering the same thing. There doesn't seem to be the equivalent of Java's BufferReader in OTP.
[20:00:08] <Ankhers> mayhew: I'll try to do a test on both versions within the next couple weeks. I will try to remember to give you an answer when I have something.
[20:00:50] <mayhew> Ankhers: I did some testing myself a while back, if you :gen_tcp.recv(4) for example, Erlang will only attempt to read 4 bytes from the socket.
[20:01:26] <mayhew> I was hoping there was something that'd read for example 8k, and only give me back 4, and then the next time I call recv take from the internal buffer if it's there.
[20:02:25] <Ankhers> Yeah. I'm trying to implement the RTMP protocol and it has variable size headers and fields. So I want to know how bad it would be for me to grab the the first byte of a header, and then the next N bytes after I know how big it is supposed to be. Right now I have a semi implementation that just calls recv(0) to grab everything and it is just keeping the extra information.
[20:02:32] <mayhew> quite possible I missed it, but I asked in #erlang and it seems like the consensus is if you want BufferedReader-like functionality you need to impl it yourself :)
[20:03:19] <mayhew> yeah, seems like the way to go (impl it yourself) -- downside is it makes your code harder to read :(
[20:03:19] <Ankhers> That seems fair. If I find that I need something like that, I will implement it.
[20:06:21] <mayhew> Ankhers: depending on the protocol, you might be able to use the :packet option -- https://erlang.org/doc/man/inet.html#packet
[20:06:43] <mayhew> the protocol I was attempting to implement didn't fit exactly how it wanted to length prefixes to be structured, so I couldn't use it
[20:07:44] <mayhew> not sure if that would fix the underlying inefficient small syscalls under the hood, but if it takes care of framing for you it'd clean up your code I imagine

[22:21:33] <serafeim> maybe. it's strange though because i could run normal phoenix projects without problem (but i havent tried with otp 24 and elixir 1.12 so maybe that's the thingie)
[22:23:11] <Nicd> I'll try with 24 and 1.12
[22:23:20] <serafeim> and windows ?
[22:23:23] <Nicd> macos
[22:25:54] <serafeim> well  i tried a different (normal) project and it worked fine in elixir 1.12 / otp 24 and windows 10
[22:26:50] <Nicd> yeah I just need 1.12 to run your code
[22:27:03] <serafeim> it's not mine :)
[22:43:46] <Nicd> I fix it
[22:44:20] <Nicd> the problem is that it's using start_link. that links the endpoint process to the running process. after the code gets to the end, your running process stops -> the endpoint process is killed
[22:45:08] <Nicd> you can add this at the end:
[22:45:20] <Nicd> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/suEbWTsd/
[22:45:41] <Nicd> then your code process will loop forever and the Phoenix endpoint will stay running
[22:50:14] <serafeim>  yes you're right ! 
[22:50:20] <serafeim> thank you
