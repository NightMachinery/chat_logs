[02:40:41] <fedorafansuper> i have this pastebin https://pastebin.com/VMLNRfyt
[02:40:44] <fedorafansuper> what can i do
[02:49:25] <Piru> you could try grabbing the curl ca bundle at https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html and then passing path to it via CURL_CA_BUNDLE environment variable
[02:49:53] <fedorafansuper> i have 0 idea what you mean
[02:50:17] <fedorafansuper> via CURL_CA_BUNDLE so i need to set that etc.
[02:50:26] <Piru> download this file https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem
[02:50:30] <fedorafansuper> ok
[02:50:52] <Piru> export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/cacert.pem
[02:51:02] <fedorafansuper> ok
[02:51:05] <Piru> obviously using the path to the file you downloaded
[02:51:14] <Piru> then try again.
[02:51:19] <fedorafansuper> ah fuck right :D
[02:51:49] <fedorafansuper> ok
[02:51:56] <Piru> no idea if this helps in this case but it might
[02:52:12] <fedorafansuper> no problem
[02:52:14] <fedorafansuper> thanks for the idea
[02:52:29] <Piru> worth a try at least
[02:53:09] <fedorafansuper> true it failed again i try to use the full path got a tilde now for homedirectory
[02:53:37] <Piru> if this doesn't help then I suppose it's up to brew to sort this out somehow
[02:53:54] <fedorafansuper> yeah
[02:54:02] <fedorafansuper> i dont know how this certgame works
[02:54:07] <fedorafansuper> something has to be signed
[02:54:11] <fedorafansuper> it can expire whatever
[02:55:32] <fedorafansuper> ok i let it as it is thanks for your idea
[02:55:36] <Piru> the reason for this mess is that there are various misonfigurations in sw and sites. the date for this thing to happen was known beforehand https://letsencrypt.org/docs/dst-root-ca-x3-expiration-september-2021/
[02:56:04] <fedorafansuper> various misconfigration?
[02:56:07] <Piru> so now that the date passed all this latent issues have popped up ;)
[02:56:55] <Piru> the issues from this expiry can be caused by misconfiguration on server(s) or clients
[02:57:07] <Piru> or using too old versions of various components
[02:57:33] <fedorafansuper> no idea
[02:57:41] <Piru> now that the certificate expired all these issues are actually manifesting themselves
[02:57:51] <fedorafansuper>  PO Box 18666, Minneapolis, MN 55418-0666, USA  supernumbers
[02:58:45] <Piru> my guess is that there will be number of updates to various sites, software etc coming up in days ahead
[02:58:55] <Piru> trying to sort these issues out
[02:58:59] <fedorafansuper> yeah but how to bypass
[02:59:29] <fedorafansuper> so my browser connects to a site that has to been signed or what
[02:59:35] <fedorafansuper> and if i give a fuck
[02:59:40] <fedorafansuper> :D
[03:01:03] <Piru> I think at this stage you might get better help from homebrew dedicated channel
[03:01:15] <fedorafansuper> its cool

[08:11:32] <acagastya> Hi, I am trying to curl POST to an HTTPS API.  But I am getting "curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: certificate has expired".  I had checked the certificate is valid until December.  Any idea how I could go about fixing this?
[08:13:33] <Tykling> acagastya: without knowing anything about your issue I am guessing it is related to https://letsencrypt.org/docs/dst-root-ca-x3-expiration-september-2021/
[08:14:22] <Tykling> long story short you are probably going to have to upgrade your client OS or whatever to get an openssl which understands how to pick the unexpired chain
[08:14:44] <acagastya> Ah, one more thing -- when I open the URL via the browser, the certificate does look valid.
[08:16:12] <acagastya> Can I instead update just few packaged instead of the whole OS?  Maybe a newer version of openssl or configuring the system certificates?
[08:17:41] <acagastya> I cannot update the operating system on this machine.
[08:22:00] <waitman> can't you do curl --insecure url ?
[08:22:59] <waitman> not sure what OS you use but usually there's a separate CA package i think/
[08:23:00] <waitman> ?
[08:24:05] <acagastya> I am posting a passphrase.  Should i really be using --insecure flag?
[08:24:22] <acagastya> And I would like to solve this problem for any URL I might want to curl.
[08:24:44] <acagastya> it is macos 10.14 (mojave).

[08:27:24] <waitman> upgrading is probably the smartest thing. but if that's not an option then maybe build openssl and curl in a separate location without dorking up the os, if that's possible
[08:31:47] <acagastya> Looks like the curl I got from `brew install curl` (not symlinked) makes it work.
[08:32:04] <acagastya> Not the most ideal solution, but I think the best I can have.

[10:24:27] <dch> while I had no production issues with the recent LE-apocalypse, I am curious why curl doesn't accept this cert from   https://expired-r3-test.scotthelme.co.uk/ while the browser does
[10:24:45] <dch> FWIW I tried with a (custom) go curl-alike tool we have in-house and it also failed with the same issue
[10:25:24] <GodEater> the most likely answer is that curl and your go tool are you using the same trust store - but the browser (you don't mention which one) is using its own (or just a different one)
[10:25:57] <dch> yeah thats kinda what I figured, but I don't *think* thats the case (on FreeBSD here).
[10:26:20] <dch> I will poke firefox and see if I can make it divulge the cert store
[10:29:38] <dch> AFAICT everything incl firefox uses security/ca_root_nss which is 3.69 
[10:29:57] <dch> I will just have a finely crafted beverage and watch the dust fall on the internet
[10:30:23] * jfuller observes the interwebs is constantly failing/succeeding
[10:30:59] <bagder> dch: there's also the problem if both the expired and the new exist as then the TLS lib need to find the "correct" trust path
[10:31:12] <bagder> which at least with curl it might not
[10:31:30] <bagder> actually, with lots of tools and libs
[10:32:35] <bagder> but I'll admit I'm not an expert on that
[10:32:51] <dch> bagder: I actually think this is the case here. that's what scott helme's cert is for testing.

[10:53:25] <Piru> for example I had Jellyfin serve old intermediate since it caches them, and I *think* it uses the CN of the certificate to determine if the cache needs to be refreshed, not cert serial number. and the new intermediate has the same CN

[11:13:26] <bagder> the "GET with body" method now leans towards becoming "QUERY"

[11:13:41] <bagder> which I think is better than SEARCH
[11:14:04] <icing> agreed
[11:14:16] <bagder> one rationale being that for many people it is used to "put the query string in the body"

[11:54:21] <pikaro> hi! I'm having an issue where different versions of curl see different SSL certificates despite all of them using TLS 1.2. The behavior is present in curl 7.38 and absent in 7.52. does someone know what default behavior of curl (just curl https://example.com) changed between these versions that might be a clue?
[11:56:12] <bagder> there were 3061 commits done between those two versions...
[11:56:45] <pikaro> yeah that's why I can't read through them :D I thought maybe there was something obvious changed
[11:56:57] <bagder> it was a long time ago, I can't remember

[12:05:48] <pikaro> yes, 1.0.1t in the old version and 1.1.1k in the new. and that's even more confusing - BOTH versions of openssl get the correct cert. libreSSL 3.3.3 however does not.
[12:06:38] <bagder> X509_V_FLAG_TRUSTED_FIRST perhaps?
[12:07:27] <bagder> I would just advice you to upgrade to modern versions and be fine with it
[12:08:53] <pikaro> yeah unfortunately that's probably the best solution instead of investing more time, interesting as it may be...
