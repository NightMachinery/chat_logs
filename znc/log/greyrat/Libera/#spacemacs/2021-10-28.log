[02:35:26] <FromGitter> <cuzdav> Hi, for c++ in spacemacs, how do I configure clangd to use c++20?  It currently is using c++14 and I haven't found any documentation on how to configure it through spacemacs.  Is there a way?  Thanks in advance.

[03:53:02] <FromGitter> <kassick> you probably want to set up either the compile_commands.json or compile_flags.txt
[03:58:05] <FromGitter> <kassick> since your project is likely to depend on other flags then just the language version,  it's better if your build system generates the compile_commands.json file automatically (CMake has built-in support, never tried with autotools)
[03:59:56] <FromGitter> <kassick> this way, flags such as -I are handled in a per-file basis, and in-sync with your build -- no need to adjust makefiles and completion flags separetedly
[04:29:49] <FromGitter> <robby:oconnor.ninja> @yyoncho: i'm sorry for tagging you directly, do you happen to know why occasionally lsp just flakes on me and refuses to start in Spacemacs, never see this in Doom Emacs (the problem fixes itself if I nuke all elpa packages and reinstall)
[05:13:48] <FromGitter> <robby:oconnor.ninja> Edit: Moved to the Discord for LSP
[05:13:54] <FromGitter> <robby:oconnor.ninja> but not sure if this relavant to Spacemacs
[07:48:35] <FromGitter> <cuzdav> Thanks for helping.  However, I do have compile_commands.json  created, and its command line does have -std=c++20 in it.  Yet I still get warnings that say things like "if initialization statements are a c++17 extension".  How can I tell *which* clangd it is using?  I see just no logs, no feedback, to tell how it's being used, launched, or even which binary is running.  Is there any documentation for how it works?  
[07:48:35] <FromGitter> ... Whether I get this working or not, I still would like to know more about what is happening behind the scenes, though.  While lisp is there, it's not very .... familiar.

[10:56:58] <FromGitter> <sp3ctum> Hi, I'm looking for a way to customize `typescript-tsx-mode` to allow me to use `SPC c l` to use "//" as the comment syntax. By default it uses html comments which are not very useful to me.

[14:18:26] <FromGitter> <chama-chomo> Thanks @yyoncho . nice  new docs, I'll take a look
[14:41:11] <FromGitter> <chama-chomo> it seems like lsp-ui-doc (when generated) blocks modeline for some reason, it doesn't happen each time ui-doc is shown, but modeline sort of flickers every time doc is being generated and from time to time it doesn't get recovered
[16:27:40] <FromGitter> <kassick> Ok, that's odd then -- if you have warnings in emacs, that means that clangd is running, but it's not using the correct flags.
[16:28:01] <FromGitter> <kassick> I created a simple project with cmake to test -- everything worked fine for me
[16:28:29] <FromGitter> <kassick> @cuzdav take a look at https://gist.github.com/kassick/cf955b6c322a709d2506916a52d88dc6
[16:29:49] <FromGitter> <kassick> After doing this, I checked the `clangd::stderr` buffer in emacs, and it load the file with the correct flags:
[16:29:57] <FromGitter> <kassick> ```code paste, see link``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=617a9ecc9d20982e4fe82dab]
[16:31:24] <FromGitter> <kassick> things that might have gone wrong: ‚èé  ‚èé 1) the compile_commands.json file is not on the project root ‚èé 2) when you opened the file, you pressed `i` and ended up selecting the some `src`-like folder as the project-root -- then clangd won't find the `compile_commands.json` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=617a9f24f2cedf67f9b04c78]
[16:35:49] <FromGitter> <chama-chomo> I've figured out what the problem is, lsp-ui-doc frame makes the modeline inactive until I move the cursor to another symbol. It happens only like in 40% of cases

[17:14:53] <FromGitter> <cuzdav> After `SPC a p`, I saw it was running an old version of clangd--not what I had expected.  The problem was it got the right flags but didn't understand them.  Fixing a broken simlink in /usr/local/bin to the latest and relaunch, and spacemacs picked it up.  That was it.  Thanks!
