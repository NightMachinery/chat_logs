[08:31:39] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> If you want an async to be made on the main thread but done on a worker, you probably need to produce it from the main thread
[08:31:54] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> `myVector2.x.int32`?
[08:31:56] <termer> that makes sense
[08:32:19] <FromDiscord> <Elegantbeef> So you queue up the actions in a pool, then threads grab and create the async off that
[08:32:52] <FromDiscord> <loaf> oh hey that worked lol

[18:20:39] <FromDiscord> <auxym> `ref` is a pointer/reference type.

[18:22:37] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @Rika "ref is *not* a": okay, i guess wording is subtle here; it is a pointer type, but it is not a "pointer" that most people think of

[18:24:17] <FromDiscord> <auxym> Yeah, didn't mean to confuse, it's similar to a pointer as in they both have reference semantics. But "pointer" in Nim specifically means "manual memory management" while ref is "automatic memory management"

[20:56:29] <PMunch> @feldharke, it imports this file https://github.com/khchen/wNim/blob/master/examples/resource/resource.nim
[20:56:48] <PMunch> The Nim compiler has some search paths to find modules
[20:57:03] <PMunch> They include the current directory, and the Nimble packages directory
[20:57:31] <PMunch> So that `import resource/resource` import the `resource.nim` file in the `resource` folder next to that example

[21:18:51] <FromDiscord> <Rika> you should probably have all of the files in the repository where they should be
[21:21:38] <PMunch> @feldharke, try to just clone the repo, that way you're sure everything is where it's supposed to be

[21:32:41] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> wait‚ÜµInt is 64 bits in nim??
[21:33:05] <PMunch> @b4mbus, maybe have a look at optionsutils?
[21:33:21] <PMunch> @System64_~_Flandre_Scarlet, int is the same size of a pointer on your architecture
[21:33:31] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> In reply to @System64 "wait Int is 64": same size as a pointer so I assume 64bits for x64 and 32bits for x86

[21:34:00] <FromDiscord> <Rika> third party
[21:34:00] <PMunch> @b4mbus, damn, guess I have to delete my module now..
[21:34:09] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> In reply to @b4mbus "same size as a": same in C?
[21:34:17] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> uh no

[21:34:23] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> (edit) "AH√ß" => "AH!"
[21:34:34] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> in C `int`s size is not set by the standard
[21:34:43] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> but it's usually 8 bytes
[21:34:45] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> (edit) "8" => "4"
[21:34:52] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> so 32-bits
[21:34:54] <FromDiscord> <Rika> nim's int and c's int are unrelated

[21:36:27] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> no, changing to `/` from `//` doesnt work either
[21:36:34] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> unless you mean something else
[21:36:41] <PMunch> Nah, it's the directory which is broken
[21:36:59] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> what should it be then?
[21:37:06] <PMunch> You can read the docs here: https://github.com/PMunch/nim-optionsutils/blob/master/src/optionsutils.nim
[21:37:26] <PMunch> I meant the nimble.directory site is broken. So documentation doesn't work
[21:37:27] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> oh that's nice

[21:42:21] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> In reply to @PMunch "I meant the nimble.directory": any reason you prefer to call functions like free functions `something(obj)` instead of what UFCS gives and `obj.something()`?
[21:42:27] <PMunch> Okay, uploaded it to my own site: https://uploads.peterme.net/htmldocs/optionsutils.html

[21:43:01] <PMunch> @b4mbus, not quite sure what you mean?
[21:43:47] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> well I quickly went over your code and I see you prefer doing things like `unsafeGet(option)` instead of `option.unsafeGet()`
[21:44:30] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> neat

[21:46:19] <PMunch> Not really, I tend to do both but in different scenarios
[21:46:36] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> alright
[21:46:36] <PMunch> Hmm, what nimble command did you try to run?
[21:46:44] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> just nimble run
[21:47:03] <PMunch> Nimble run?
[21:47:08] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> yes
[21:47:10] <PMunch> Oh, on a project which requires the module?
[21:47:16] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> yeah
[21:47:23] <PMunch> What is your require statement then
[21:47:38] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3Rqo
[21:49:24] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> ok maybe mire unfo

[22:05:27] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> probably because you are shifting by 10?
[22:05:42] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> FF00FF is 3 bytes
[22:05:44] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> 24 bits
[22:06:55] <PMunch> @b4mbus, your error says `MyEnym`, did you misspell something?
[22:07:09] <PMunch> Oh, you edited it
[22:07:18] <PMunch> You need to export the enum
[22:07:26] <PMunch> With a * after the name of the enum
[22:07:28] <PMunch> MyEnum*
[22:07:52] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> oh, you are from an IRC so you dont se edits and removed messages. I removed the message because I realized what's wrong. I had no star in there so the enum was not public
[22:08:01] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> In reply to @PMunch "You need to export": yeah exactly
[22:08:16] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> In reply to @b4mbus "probably because you are": it should shift by 10 bits, right?
[22:08:37] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> yes, and your value is 111111110000000011111111
[22:08:53] <PMunch> It seems like you want shr 16?
[22:08:59] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> ^
[22:09:21] <FromDiscord> <System64 ~ Flandre Scarlet> ah, it's that, thanks
[22:09:23] <PMunch> @b4mbus, we get edits, just as separate messages
[22:09:30] <PMunch> But no deletes
[22:10:03] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> ph
[22:10:05] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> (edit) "ph" => "oh"
[22:10:28] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> I thought Nim's bitops would have some kind of `getByte`
[22:10:34] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> (edit) "`getByte`" => "`getByte(LE/BE)`"
[22:12:33] <PMunch> It's easy enough to make a template for that
[22:12:57] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> well a lot of Nim's stdlib features are simple enough to be selfmade
[22:14:37] <PMunch> Fair
[22:16:11] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3Rqw
[22:16:45] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> `utils.tryGetEnv` returns an `Option[string]`
[22:16:58] <PMunch> Your misunderstanding the concept of either
[22:17:23] <PMunch> You're
[22:17:31] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> so what would be the correct and idomatic way to achieve: get the `some` or if it's `none` log an error and quit
[22:17:49] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> (edit) "`some`" => "`some`s value"
[22:17:58] <PMunch> Throw an exception
[22:17:59] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> (edit) "`some`s" => "`some`'s"
[22:18:01] <PMunch> I think that should work
[22:18:28] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> but I want it to be logged
[22:18:49] <PMunch> So set up a try block?
[22:19:14] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> but that would be ugly and using exceptions for control flow which is bad practice
[22:19:19] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> and I wanted it to be a neat oneliner
[22:19:32] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> I guess Ill just do it above instead of inside `newDiscordClient`
[22:20:14] <PMunch> What are you talking about, exceptions are a control flow mechanism
[22:23:42] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> yes but they are not meant used for typical control flow which can be achieved with structural language features, functional mechanisms or such
[22:24:02] <PMunch> Something like this: https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3Rqz
[22:24:34] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> exceptions should be used purely for "I have a situation I cannot deal with and I have no way for signalizing that because that doesnt happen very often, that is really an exceptional situation"
[22:25:03] <PMunch> You mean something like not having a valid token for the service you're going to use?
[22:25:45] <PMunch> If you do "log and exit" that is essentially the same as just throwing an exception
[22:26:31] <PMunch> Only difference is that now you can't use it as a library with a `try: initialiseLibrary() except DiscordError: <guess we have to do something else>`
[22:26:40] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> In reply to @PMunch "You mean something like": No, that is something that can happen. I don't consider it as an exceptional situation that cannot be avoided. I would just prefer to prompt that a token wasnt found
[22:27:57] <FromDiscord> <b4mbus> In this exact situation since it's not really deep in the program it doesn't matter that much tho, yes\
