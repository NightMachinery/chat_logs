[17:00:43] <Geekingfrog> And you're at school at the same time?
[17:01:10] <Brekkjern> I am trying to get a BS while I work, yeah
[17:11:01] <Geekingfrog> man, must be tough
[17:13:23] <Brekkjern> It is. I'm doing about 2/3rds of what a normal student does in addition to working, so.
[17:13:50] <Brekkjern> At least work is nice and lets me do homework/remote classes while at work if it doesn't clash with something else
[17:25:02] <gerikson> just installed discord on a new computer - I logged in by opening the app on my phone, and scanning a QR code
[17:25:16] <gerikson> compare that would SASL in IRC...
[17:25:39] <gerikson> recurring complaints on #freenode@freenode.net about activation emails geting lost
[17:26:12] <gwozniak> I like IRC but the IRC apologists are insufferable
[17:26:42] <Brekkjern> Discord is honestly a pretty fucking brilliant service
[17:26:59] <Brekkjern> Considering what you get for the price of "free"
[17:27:18] <Brekkjern> Not gonna say it's perfect, but it is pretty good.
[17:27:38] <gerikson> I listen to a history podcast that probably appeals to mostly old fogeys like me, and *they* have a discord
[17:27:42] <gwozniak> But it's bad because it's not easily used from Emacs
[17:27:45] <gerikson> they make fun of the name, of course
[17:29:02] <Brekkjern> I hang around on only one Discord server for its community. The rest are friend groups.
[17:29:19] <Brekkjern> But still, it works for both those types of uses, and it works well
[17:31:21] <gwozniak> I don't really have anyone to talk to on Discord, but I'm not going to say it's a terrible service because it's too centralized
[17:52:25] <leon> Brekkjern: do you work full time?
[17:53:19] <leon> I'm also doing 2/3rds of the courses a normal student would but I only manage towork 20 hours
[18:01:15] <edk> gerikson: i mean, sasl is like, you type your username in a place and your password in another place
[18:01:25] <edk> the reason it's complicated is mostly intrinsic imo
[18:03:03] <edk> IRC-the-protocol has no control over how clients present things, so there's no one set of instructions that will work for everyone, and client developers don't have much incentive to make it easy because users are asking IRC networks, not client developers, for help
[18:04:31] <edk> so you get a bunch of clients which are about as easy to operate as your average supersonic fighter jet and deeply branching sets of instructions written by people who don't use them very often
[18:05:06] <edk> discord doesn't have to deal with that because they control all the discord clients
[18:11:59] <gerikson> yeah and SASL is basically a bolt-on when people realized that sending credentials in cleartext was a bad idea
[18:15:56] <edk> well SASL still mostly sends them in cleartext
[18:18:07] <edk> there are SASL mechanisms that don't but SASL is mainly solving an integration problem not a security problem; connecting over TLS should be enough security for most people
[18:18:19] <gerikson> yeah
[18:30:38] <skyl4rk> I never got the hang of discord, not that I was particularly interested in spending time there. Got the impression of lots of more noise, like joining a small irc server and all rooms in it, getting pinged about unread messages in all of them.
[18:32:22] <gerikson> yeah I think people go overboard with "channels" in "servers"
[18:35:17] <gwozniak> LLVM has recently stopped using mailing lists and has moved everything to Discourse
[18:35:44] <gwozniak> I have to try it out to see how I feel about it
[18:37:11] <gwozniak> Pretty much the only thing I did on the mailing lists was read
[18:38:42] <companion_cube> discourse has a mailing list mode that works well, imho
[18:38:55] <gwozniak> Yeah, I have to set that up

[18:40:10] <gwozniak> I find reading a timeline in the manner presented by forum software of the past (which is the feel I get as I browse the LLVM Discourse site now) to be not that awesome
[18:41:13] <ngoldbaum> not a fan of the scrolling on discourse
[18:41:22] <ngoldbaum> hard to navigate a long discussion
[18:41:38] <gwozniak> That's what I'm getting so far
[18:41:47] <companion_cube> I read it mostly in my email client tbh
[18:42:13] <companion_cube> but I tend to use discourse to write answers, cause it's nicer to edit markdown and reply-quote
[18:44:28] <gwozniak> I will say that reading archived discussions on the mailing list website pretty much sucks
[18:57:16] <kronk> ngoldbaum: what exactly is their recourse for these loans if they aren't repaid.

[23:07:25] <companion_cube> kline: lolol
[23:07:42] <companion_cube> there's paying ones like the lounge
[23:07:52] <kronk> TheLounge is free.
[23:08:00] <companion_cube> and ddevault has launched his own, which is probably his project I'm the happiest about
[23:08:03] <companion_cube> (the fact it exists)
[23:08:12] <companion_cube> ah! maybe it's irccloud that's not free?
[23:08:14] <kline> gwozniak, both exist. you can get free or paid for communal bouncer services
[23:08:16] <kline> i run my own
[23:08:31] <companion_cube> I run weechat in a VPS, it's not even a bouncer :D
[23:08:33] <kline> companion_cube, irccloud has a free and premium tier
[23:12:06] <companion_cube> anyway: https://sourcehut.org/blog/2021-11-29-announcing-the-chat.sr.ht-public-beta/ might be cool
[23:12:07] <buttsbot> Announcing chat.sr.ht: a persistent IRC session for sourcehut users
[23:14:49] <Brekkjern> leon: Yeah, I work 40 hours a week, plus 2/3rds uni.
[23:23:02] <leon> Impressive, I am already feeling like I can't spend as much time on uni as I should
[23:23:29] <Brekkjern> I'm also not spending as much time on it as I should, but it somehow works out
