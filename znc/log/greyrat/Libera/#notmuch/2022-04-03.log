[22:57:02] <madduck> I'm currently looking into muchsync to replace offlineimap, so that I finally be able to use notmuch tags across my devices. Is that the only such project, or should I look into others as well?
[22:57:39] <madduck> Also, how do people handle mail-on-the-go, i.e. via Android? Is there a smart way to integrate muchsync with an IMAP server?
[22:57:45] <madduck> (or another sync tool?)
[22:58:00] <madduck> i've looked on the webpage and wiki, but didn't find anything about syncâ€¦
[22:58:21] <bremner> yeah, I think much sync, or some hack based on save-restore.
[22:58:49] <bremner> I've been working on making one such hack more "official", but currently nmbug still lives under devel/
[22:58:57] <madduck> \o/
[22:58:58] <bremner> and isn't installed in e.g. debian
[22:59:14] <madduck> I am weary of using something like notmuchfs underneath dovecot, but hey, life is shortâ€¦
[22:59:48] <bremner> I guess neither muchsync nor nmbug will help with android.
[23:00:01] <bremner> both need a full notmuch install afaik
[23:02:44] <madduck> when you're done with nmbug, just write the android client then will ya alright thank you!
