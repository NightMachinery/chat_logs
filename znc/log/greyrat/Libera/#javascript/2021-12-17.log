[02:37:39] <ljharb> Decker: it's slow by design, and means it won't work in a ton of older browsers.

[02:38:50] <Decker> babel with private fields was hard to find... even google-closure-comiler doesn't implement them

[02:43:39] <Decker> I was trying to use reusable components - and found I had to commit these node_modules so the pages to serve could be served.  The build product of this is 1 JS file with no dependancies that's just math; it's a huge bloat of a unit-test for that code.

[11:24:14] <oscurochu46> true
[11:25:00] <Syg> yep
[11:25:24] <oscurochu46> well there is a lot of other work that is going into my project, but that same work can be reused for other games ill be working on.
[11:26:05] <oscurochu46> im planning on designing an arcade, so it probably is in my future to learn gaming.

[12:36:26] <nb-ben> what's the recommended way to check for object content equality? i.e. a={x:1,y:2}, b={x:1,y:2}, where a.equals(b) would be true?

[12:47:23] *** Joins: reallymemorable (~reallymem@94.202.39.214)
[12:47:24] <Cork> so it depends on what cheats you can live with. If all you store is primitives JSON.stringify is an option
[12:47:41] <Cork> else you will have to write a function the loops all the content in the objects and compares them individually
[12:47:55] <Cork> but that becomes expensive for large objects
[12:48:19] <Cork> also note that key order matters if you use JSON.stringify
[12:48:53] <Decker> I included cannonical sorting of fields for JSOX's stringify so even {x:1,y:2} and {y:2,x:1} are also equal if stringified (JSON result would not compare same)

[12:49:41] <Cork> if you store functions or dom elements is another case where json doesn't work

[17:52:26] <Ronalds_Mazitis_>  happened = true;
[17:53:33] <jaawerth> right, the error is moving in teh right direction since it's now *trying* to assign to it. but a const by nature isn't reassignable, that's the point of it. that error is giving you a hint what you need to do ;-)
[17:54:31] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> var is?
[17:54:39] <jaawerth> or let
[17:54:43] <jaawerth> I'd use let
[17:55:09] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> oh yeah
[17:55:13] <Ronalds_Mazitis_> very well
[17:56:10] <jaawerth> my rule is to use const by default unless I *know* I'm going to assign to it later, in which case I use let. there's very little reason to use var anymore unless you have a specific reason to (like in the js console so you can re-paste code that declares it, since you can't declare a let more than once in the same scope)

Think traditional arcade, you put a quarter in the machine, you play for 2-3 minutes, and then the game is over. The money has to go from the player's wallet to the game wallet.

[23:15:42] <ljharb> and either way "encryption" isn't the same as "security"
[23:16:20] <obimod> it's only a protocol for describing the way in which comms are encrypted, and authenticating the "who"
[23:16:54] <AlbertLast> ljharb: and what is the error in my description?
[23:17:08] <obimod> and asserting client/server behavior, given compliant clients/servers

[23:18:33] <ljharb> AlbertLast: https/ssl/tls whatever you want to call it works precisely by doing encryption
[23:18:56] <ljharb> the pedantic details of the protocol are irrelevant, i'm describing the concept and you know that.
[23:19:15] *** Joins: cantelope (~cantelope@cantelope.org)
[23:20:14] <AlbertLast> https is a differnet layer than ssl/tls, mostly someone mean tls when talking about security
[23:21:36] <ljharb> it's all the same concept

[23:23:28] <obimod> layers matter though since pretty much all exploits depend on a chain of vulnerabilities
[23:23:40] *** Joins: audiobirb (~audio@user/audio)
[23:23:50] <obimod> or maybe not even vulnerabilities,  behaviors, rather
[23:25:02] <obimod> perhaps better known as the "attack chain"
[23:26:35] *** Joins: Naan (~Naan@user/naan)
[23:27:09] <obimod> i guess that my only real concern is how many people are making the albeit amoral calculation that if they don't exploit these in-the-wild easy target they are not doing their due diligence

[23:31:40] <obimod> i suppose it may depend on what level they are at in their respective organization doing the exploiting, but i suppose with the state of global communications being the way it is it does feel very dog-eat-dog, no doubt in large part by malicious design
