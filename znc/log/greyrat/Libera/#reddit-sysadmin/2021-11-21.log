[03:12:37] <Hunterkll> more than just pure momentum and equipment/software support over time
[03:13:22] <Hunterkll> but yea, 99% of people will never see the addresses, lol
[03:14:29] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: the bigger barrier to adoption was just education and equipment adoption .... and that IPv6 wasn't really a "first class" citizen in the majority of the PC world until Vista came out (which was also the first release they stopped testing with it disabled/uninstalled and started making features rely on it internally)
[03:14:38] <Hunterkll> and, well, lazy as fuck ISPs 
[03:15:11] <Hunterkll> Comcast and T-Mobile really deserve gold medals for their initiative in that space, they really kickstarted IPv6 adoption 
[03:15:57] <Hunterkll> what really hurt IPv6 the most though was all the effort and tech that went into *working around* the problems that NAT introduced, for things like VOIP and online gaming, etc
[03:16:13] <Hunterkll> so you had hackish, "mostly-working" solutions, so people are like.... well why bother?

[03:16:55] <Hunterkll> now that providers, businesses, etc are getting squeezed REALLY hard on the RIR IP space allocations, IPv6 adoption is swinging up even harder since they're now forced to, essentially
[03:17:00] <Hunterkll> instead of just letting workarounds and hax work
[03:18:24] <Cl0udNinja> yeah, I can see that. its really just a big pain that they didnt so much extend ipv4 as made everything entirely new, and I get the reasoning, at least somewhat, but theres stuff that was done for ipv6 that I dont understand
[03:18:35] *** Joins: shokohsc8618 (~shokohsc@161.88.195.77.rev.sfr.net)
[03:18:39] <Hunterkll> as a back end content/application/ISP provider, you don't care if the people accessing your shit are behind NAT (well, for shit like youtube, etc) but if you've only got a handful of IPs front facing, wellllll it's going to be hell for you so.... now that comcast and t-mo drove IPv6 widespread a decade ago, you can light up IPv6 space split out the load
[03:18:42] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: like what? 
[03:19:05] <Hunterkll> i mean technically, extending IPv4 was never goi ng to work in any sane manner
[03:19:24] <Hunterkll> and with such a major tech sh ift anyway, might as well go back to the original ideas and "do it right"
[03:20:02] <Hunterkll> even just adding another octet to an  IPv4 address would still make legacy IPv4 devices unable to communicate to new networks, and require an entire dual-stack approach, plus router hardware replacement/upgrades, etc 
[03:20:02] <Cl0udNinja> the nat thing and each system having all these crazy amount of IPs, its just odd the way they structured it I guess

[03:20:19] <Hunterkll> NAT was an unholy hack to start with 
[03:20:21] <Hunterkll> right
[03:20:23] <Cl0udNinja> true
[03:20:24] <Hunterkll> why would you want NAT?!?!
[03:21:05] <Hunterkll> and each network, I think you mean
[03:21:11] <Hunterkll> each system'll only have one IP normally
[03:21:25] <Hunterkll> though with privacy extensions that'll change every 24 hours or so about just to reduce tracking/etc 
[03:21:35] <estranger> Hunterkll wingrep looks sweet
[03:22:02] <Hunterkll> it's actually pretty neat - it'll keep the old IPv6 addresses alive, but no longer initiate new connections/accept inbound ones, until the last session using that address closes, then it'll drop the address
[03:22:44] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: but the idea behind a /64 being the smallest network you should assign is really at its core a simple one - autoconfiguration of IP address based on host's MAC address
[03:23:17] <Hunterkll> XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX - the mutable part of a /64 - is only two longer than an ethernet MAC address 
[03:23:52] <estranger> yo momma is mutable
[03:23:58] <Cl0udNinja> with muh dick
[03:24:04] <Hunterkll> obviously I turn off privacy extensions and the whole rotation bullshit with servers
[03:24:13] <Hunterkll> so if i know the subnet and mac address of a VM
[03:24:14] <Hunterkll> i know the IP
[03:24:26] <Hunterkll> among many other ways to do it

[03:25:20] <Hunterkll> update your RAs/SLAAC config, only the X's change, the Y's don't 
[03:25:30] <Hunterkll> machines pick up new router automatically, boom
[03:25:37] <Hunterkll> you've just shifted the entire network to a new vlan/subnet/IP space
[03:25:58] <estranger> and then emit an event to your KAFKA cluster for auditing and triggers
[03:26:01] <Hunterkll> makes shit absurdly easy when doing huge network changes or combining networks together
[03:26:39] <estranger> ok looks like I still have a job then
[03:27:04] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: if we had an IPv6 based network at work, we wouldn't have been running crazy ass dual VLAN temporary setups to migrate machines to new merged network segments
[03:27:13] <Hunterkll> we wouldn't have spent months RE-IPing shit because of merging networks together
[03:27:14] <Hunterkll> etc
[03:27:21] <Hunterkll> god that shit was a nightmare
[03:27:28] <Hunterkll> IPv6 it would have been done literally overnight
[03:27:33] <Hunterkll> that's why you have /64's as the allocation size
[03:27:51] <Hunterkll> well, one of many reasons anyway :P
[03:27:58] <estranger> man instacart uses 3 hour delivery windows now, that sucks
[03:28:20] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: the /64 idea wasn't always there in IPv6 development - that seemingly "huge" allocation came after years of trial/error/experimentation/ideas

[03:37:09] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> I know nothing about this shit man
[03:37:15] <Hunterkll> there's no channels, and the bandwidth used is whatever the fuck the protocol/transmission type you're using ... uses
[03:37:21] <Hunterkll> and you can basically use whatever the fuck you want
[03:40:14] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> nice to know
[03:40:28] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> not that i'll be doing any transmitting with my 50mW
[03:40:52] <Hunterkll> i mean, I can be transmitting stuff in 6m taht uses anything from 32hz bandwidth to (well, obvoiusly not on 6 and 2m) signals that use a whopping 6MHz of bandwidth all at once
[03:40:56] <Hunterkll> (Live NTSC video)
[03:42:08] <Hunterkll> fun fact: Channels 57 to 61 on cable television (analog) fall in the 70cm (440mhz) band range. Which means if you can build a transmitter to spit out the camera's NTSC signal, a standard TV with an antenna can be used to receive/watch it

[03:48:45] <Hunterkll> sigh
[03:49:01] <Hunterkll> on update it should just open the "We've updated you, here's what's new" page
[03:49:09] <Hunterkll> otherwise, there's no monetization in it except for the default MSN home page
[03:49:24] <Hunterkll> which.... you can change. well, it's also set for new tabs too

[03:51:22] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: sadly though, MS isn't actually getting any money out of that deal - i think they're more trying to show off the DRM tech that they have that lets them do things other browsers

[03:53:15] <Hunterkll> ah
[03:53:23] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: actually, in this case, i'd suspect microsoft paid philo 
[03:53:37] <Hunterkll> pcspkr: because if you're not using edge, you can only get a 7-day free trial from this philo service
[03:53:43] <Hunterkll> with edge, it lets you get a 30 day trial

[05:12:54] <JollyRgrs> fritzwastaken: anytime someone takes their own life, it is hard to deal with as those left after the fact. the best thing you can do is try your best to make sure that yourself and others don't get to the point of hopelessness where the idea of death is not only ideal, but the only option
[05:13:16] <JollyRgrs> focus your energies in trying to help others from meeting the same fate
[05:13:57] <JollyRgrs> that's my best advice. i'm bad at giving advice for grieving b/c I usually only ever for a very short time
[05:13:59] <catbeard> the best you can do is excel at what you do, and live the best live you can for yourself
[05:14:09] <fritzwastaken> Ive been on the verge and the only thing that has stopped me was knowing how it impacted his brother, his sister and his mother, whom Im friends with all of them
[05:14:30] <catbeard> and send his parents your condolences without reminding them of uncomfortable facts
[05:14:50] <fritzwastaken> Nothing sobers your opinion of suicide like paying for your friends brain to be cleaned off a wall

[08:07:39] <spooo> if I have a pihole and I have my router DNS set to the pihole, what's going on. seems like an inception of some sorts to me
[08:08:50] <TurkeyGibby> how?
[08:09:43] <spooo> just having a hard time conceptualizing it
[08:09:46] <TurkeyGibby> whats the difference between configuring your router at home to use a local DNS server and a business network doing the same?
[08:10:23] <spooo> like if all of my outgoing traffic is routed back into the lan, when does it reach outside?
[08:10:46] <spooo> I'm definitely misunderstanding what's going on, but that's all I got
[08:10:59] <catbeard> you need to configure an upstream dns server
[08:11:08] <TurkeyGibby> ...
[08:11:14] <catbeard> you need to set DHCP DNS to the pihole LAN IP too
[08:11:36] <spooo> I didn't configure anything like that, so I'm guessing it somehow auto configured one?
[08:11:50] <JollyRgrs> to conceptualize... your router is a router/gateway/dns... think of those as all separate things
[08:12:01] <JollyRgrs> not "once it goes to my router it should go to the internet"
[08:12:07] <catbeard> go to the pihole ip in a browser
[08:12:23] <spooo> catbeard: I'm there already
[08:12:42] <catbeard> https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/cloudflared/
[08:12:51] <catbeard> https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/upstream-dns-providers/ also
[08:13:07] <JollyRgrs> spooo: your DNS service provider is what is serving the IP Resolution to you. if it doesn't know, the DNS service forwards out to the internet to find out and then returns the result to you
[08:13:33] <spooo> ah, I remember setting Cloudflare as my upstream dns
[08:13:39] <JollyRgrs> so it goes PC -> DNS Server -> internet for IP (if needed), then sends that IP back to your PC
[08:13:58] <JollyRgrs> if you can't conceptualize that... you might not be needing to play with pihole just yet
[08:14:08] <catbeard> also https://sysadmin.name/blocking-ads-with-unbound-and-dot/ with some modifications if you want :) dns traffic then goes out on 5353/udp so it's filtered separately and encrypted
[08:14:15] <spooo> but I'm still confused because I have PC -> Router -> PiHole
[08:14:28] <spooo> I set my router DNS to the pihole ip
[08:14:40] <catbeard> that's for the router itself doing dns lookups
[08:14:45] <catbeard> dhcp dns is for the lan clients
[08:15:19] <spooo> ah, that makes sense
[08:15:59] <spooo> so basically pihole is only doing the dns lookups, while the router still handles the dhcp
[08:16:04] <catbeard> if you're forcing both, you could dst-nat 53 to your LAN IP for traffic coming from LAN subnets and force your local DNS, so someone can't e.g. `dig @1.1.1.1 zone.tld`
[08:16:07] <catbeard> yes
[08:16:14] <catbeard> but there's a dhcp option in pihole
[08:16:53] <spooo> if I enable that, wouldn't it conflict with the router?
[08:18:20] <spooo> I guess it wouldn't if I manually configure each client to use the pihole dns
[08:18:35] <spooo> but if I kept my current settings (which is router -> pihole), then it'd conflict
[08:18:38] <catbeard> https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-use-pi-holes-built-in-dhcp-server-and-why-would-i-want-to/3026
[08:18:49] <spooo> yeah, I finished reading that catbeard
[08:18:56] <spooo> just a couple seconds ago
[08:19:59] <catbeard> spooo: yes it will conflict with router dhcp if it's configured the same
[08:21:31] <catbeard> but if the pihole is the only device doing the dhcp you can set it as the router's ip after unplugging your router, then reboot it active, and all dhcp clients should renew the lease with pihole and hand out the pihole dhcp dns settings

[18:25:40] <technonerd> they have been going ham on new flavours
[18:26:23] <yuken> technonerd, Mountain Dew flavors have been poggers.
[18:26:44] <technonerd> code red, baja blast and classic is all i need
[18:27:40] <yuken> technonerd, all 3 of those flavors suck.
[18:28:04] <technonerd> /kickban yuken pepsi_shill
[18:28:15] <yuken> Mountain Dew is distributed by Pepsi tho
[18:28:32] <yuken> There are much better flavors tha nthe ones you listed, too :P. Like Kickstart Black CHerry.
[18:28:36] <yuken> Or Blueberry Pomegranate.
[18:29:37] <technonerd> the rebranded kickstarts are good
[18:29:52] <technonerd> also sick ass poly lion logo
[18:29:53] <yuken> technonerd, I'm pissed off that they removed Blueberry Pomegranate from Kickstart, and moved it to their Rise line.
[18:29:56] <yuken> Because Kickstart is $1.25 a can.
[18:29:58] <yuken> And Rise is $2.75.
