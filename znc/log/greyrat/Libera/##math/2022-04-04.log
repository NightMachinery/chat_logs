One small thing, that *so* many people get wrong: use  Thm.\ 7  or  Thm.~7   and not just Thm. 7 as you have, because that last puts in sentence-boundary whitespace which is way too much. I think Thm.~7 is the best way: looks wacky to let that split across a line.)

[00:59:48] <vando45> So then he also said that "try to use i/m and j/n (or j/m and i/n) w/e you choose as coordinates to points you are sampling (that is, function values) in a Riemann sum"

[01:01:17] <vando45> But by your argument, the only possible boundaries for the inner series are n and 0, n >= j/cos(i/m) >= 0
[01:01:45] <Z-module> I think it comes out to a truncated version of the original integral, namely    \int \int sin(x) dx dy   over the region between the graph of cos and the x-axis, but only from x = 0 out to 1 instead of out to pi/2
[01:02:33] <vando45> That's what I thought as well when I arrived to this https://i.imgur.com/SSTA8xM.png
[01:02:45] <vando45> That would be true tho only if cos(x) instead of floor(cos(x))
[01:04:01] <vando45> But also from problem 1, when I think about it, https://i.imgur.com/YE8lc5O.png cos(x) is an upper bound for a Riemann sum. But by what you said earlier, this one shouldn't work either right?
[01:06:03] <yashi> If the Wiener measure may be interpreted as an integral over continuous functions f:[0,T]->R, i.e. P[{f(t) = y}] = exp(-y^2/4t) / sqrt(4pi t), in the sense that the integrand is exp(-\int_{0}^t f'^2), then what is the integral over the integrand exp(-\int_{0}^t g^2 f'^2) for some fixed g?
[01:07:31] <Z-module> That dx dy   in that last image needs to be   dy dx.  The leftmost integration variable is for the innermost integral.
[01:07:56] <vando45> Yea that's how I did it on the next slide.

[04:25:42] <energizer> i suppose so

[04:26:06] <energizer> i was imagining there would be a way to solve it even if r was big
[04:26:13] <Fangs> (r-1)2 = (r-1+b), so 2r-2 = r-1+b --->  2r - r = 2-1+b ---> r = b+1?

[04:50:34] <alphamule> So...
[04:50:36] <ihate> answer is (r,b) = (3,1) I think
[04:50:37] <zeroc00l0> And they will all be congruent to 1 (mod 4).
[04:50:41] <zeroc00l0> 9 = 1 (mod 4)

[07:36:41] <GoodGuy> hi
[07:37:41] <GoodGuy> Say we have the following equation for Hyperbola 36x^2 - 49y^2 - 100 = 0. How can I parameterize this parabola so it lies in second quadrant ?
[07:40:49] <isekaijin> It's a hyperbola, not a parabola.
[07:41:07] <isekaijin> And neither a hyperbola nor a parabola can be fully contained in a quadrant.

[07:41:36] <isekaijin> In any case, whether a curve is contained in a quadrant is a property of the curve itself, not of its parametrization.

[07:45:34] <GoodGuy> @isekaijin
[07:46:13] <isekaijin> This is IRC, not Twitter, so the @ is unnecessary.
[07:46:57] <isekaijin> GoodGuy: Also, you haven't addressed the main objection, which is that no reparamerization can make the hyperbola lie on the second quadrant, because that property doesn't depend on the parametrization to begin wtih.
[07:47:06] <isekaijin> with*
[07:47:43] <GoodGuy> isekaijin: the part of the hyperbola that lies in the second quadrant
[07:48:10] <isekaijin> Oh.
[07:48:48] <isekaijin> Then you should have said “how can I parametrize the part that lies in the second quadrant”. Now that makes sense. Let's see.
[07:49:17] <isekaijin> First of all, we rearrange terms in the equation of the hyperbola.
[07:49:25] <isekaijin> 36x^2 - 49y^2 = 100
[07:49:51] <isekaijin> (36/100) x^2 - (49/100) y^2 = 1
[07:50:18] <GoodGuy> isekaijin: ok that should be x^2/(10^2/6^2) - y^2 / (10^2/7^2) = 1
[07:50:26] <isekaijin> Yes.
[07:50:30] <isekaijin> But wait.
[07:50:52] <isekaijin> Therefore, we may set (36/100) x^2 = cosh(t)^2 and (49/100) y^2 = sinh(t)^2.

[07:51:12] <GoodGuy> can we use sec and tan?
[07:51:19] <GoodGuy> I haven't learned about cosh and sinh
[07:51:27] <isekaijin> Oh. Okay.
[07:51:42] <isekaijin> Then we will set (36/100) x^2 = sec(t)^2 and (49/100) y^2 = tan(t)^2.
[07:51:52] <isekaijin> Because sec(t)^2 - tan(t)^2 = 1.
[07:52:06] <isekaijin> So far so good?

[07:52:33] <GoodGuy> yes
[07:53:00] <isekaijin> Okay, then we can set x = (5/3) sec(t) and y = (10/7) tan(t).
[07:53:14] <isekaijin> Finally, we need to find the appropriate range for the parameter t.
[07:53:27] <GoodGuy> yes I am following you so far I have that as well
[07:53:28] *** Quits: CatCow (~wtf_over@c-73-96-109-206.hsd1.or.comcast.net) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[07:53:31] <isekaijin> It has to be so that (x,y) is in the second quadrant.
[07:53:34] <GoodGuy> but I don't understand how to get parameter t
[07:53:52] <isekaijin> In the second quadrant, x is negative and y is positive.
[07:54:04] <GoodGuy> yes
[07:54:05] <isekaijin> So we need to find values of t such that sec(t) is negative and tan(t) is positive.
[07:54:33] <isekaijin> sec(t) = 1 / cos(t), so we need cos(t) to be negative.
[07:54:43] <isekaijin> tan(t) = sin(t) / cos(t), so we need sin(t) and cos(t) to have the same sign, so we need sin(t) to be negative as well.
[07:54:57] <isekaijin> So far so good?
[07:55:02] <GoodGuy> yes makes sense
[07:55:22] <isekaijin> Okay, for angles in what quadrant are sin(t) and cos(t) both negative?
[07:55:56] <isekaijin> (Well, we can take sin(t) = 0, but cos(t) has to be strictly negative, because we have it in the denominator in both expressions.)
[07:56:14] <GoodGuy> from t = pi/2 to 3pi/2 ?
[07:56:20] <isekaijin> Yes.
[07:56:27] <isekaijin> Now, the final step.
[07:56:48] <isekaijin> Errr
[07:56:52] <isekaijin> No, wait.
[07:56:58] <isekaijin> From t = pi to 3pi/2.
[07:57:12] <GoodGuy> yes sorry from pi to 3pi/2
[07:57:23] <isekaijin> Now the final step.
[07:57:36] <isekaijin> We know that t is an interval with endpoints at pi and 3pi/2.
[07:57:46] <isekaijin> But we have yet to decide whether the endpoints are closed or open.
[07:57:52] <isekaijin> (Each endpoint has to be tested separately.)
[07:58:14] <isekaijin> Mmm, wait. Do you want your parametrization to include the point where the hyperbola crosses the x axis?
[07:58:37] <isekaijin> If not, then you can just take the open interval ]pi, 3pi/2[ and call it a day.
[07:58:40] <GoodGuy> no crossing x-axis or y-axis
[07:58:41] <GoodGuy> ye
[07:58:47] <isekaijin> Okay.
[07:58:58] <GoodGuy> can you explain though to me what if includes those points
[07:59:03] <GoodGuy> how would we test it ?
[07:59:29] <isekaijin> The hyperbola has two branches, but only one of those passes through the second quadrant.
[07:59:39] <isekaijin> Each branch cuts the x axis at one point.
[08:00:16] <GoodGuy> yeah

[08:01:37] <isekaijin> Mmm, wait, sorry, phone.
[08:01:45] <GoodGuy> np !
[08:03:17] <isekaijin> Okay, if we want to consider the point where the hyperbola passes through (x,y)  = (-5/3, 10/7), then we need sec(t) = -1 and tan(t) = 0, hence t = pi.

[13:44:20] <cadmio> is it correct?
[13:44:38] <greenbagels> cadmio: for one, they dont specify countable collection, so your index set for E_i need not be N
[13:45:08] <greenbagels> you can just say for i in some arbitrary index set A
[13:46:42] <greenbagels> now i would also be more careful about E; you don't want the intersection of any collection of subfields of E, you want the intersection of *all subfields that contain F and S*
[13:48:57] <cadmio> I think I've proved that the intersection of a certain number of subfields of E is again a subfield of E
[13:49:29] <cadmio> then you can pick specifically those subfields containing F and S to get the smallest subfield I was seeking

[13:58:37] <greenbagels> (to actually be clear, i just mean give a short few words explaining why "clearly" this is the case)
[13:59:12] <cadmio> the intersection of all subfielfds of E containg S and F is minimal by defintion of intersection
[13:59:23] <cadmio> I don't think you've to prove minimality as well
[13:59:55] <greenbagels> i agree, but i think pointing it out is good form
[14:00:25] <greenbagels> it leaves less doubt in your teachers mind as to "is it *actually* clear to them, or are they just saying its clear"
[14:01:16] <cadmio> how could I be more clear?
[14:02:03] <greenbagels> its fine dont worry about it, its mostly just personal taste
[14:02:40] <cadmio> it would be better off to be more accuarate
[14:06:00] <greenbagels> pretty much what you said here in chat: by construction, any subfield of E containing S and F also contains I, and so I is minimal
[14:07:21] <cadmio> ok

[18:26:52] <revolve9> Batzy, I'm coming back to that Stokes's flow problem from before.  https://imgur.com/a/ayYuPvP has the qsn and solution. Just starting from fresh, I don't get 1) why they seem to switch from d^2u_x/dy^2 to d^2u_x/dz^2, shouldn't it be consistant? 2) is it y or z in the vertical direction? I thought it should be z because they say zero velocity on
[18:26:52] <revolve9> z = 0,h ? u_x is the component of velocity, u_y is the y component of velocity and x as labelled in the pic is correct.

[19:41:44] <Z-module> cadmio, well, there are two ways of defining F(S), and one of them is just this intersection itself.
[19:42:00] <cadmio> my text defines F(S) as the smallest subfield of E that contains F and the set S and leaves as exercise to verify it corresponds to the intersection of all subfields of E that contain F and the set S

[21:23:31] <int-e> Fangs: The determinant must be 1. If you write A = [a b; c d], then from A A* = A* A = 1 you get |a| = |d|, |b| = |c| and |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. So for the determinant, 1 = a d - b c <= |a d - b c| <= |a| |d| + |b| |c| = 1 with equality only if ad is real and ad >= 0, and bc is real and bc <= 0. So a and d are conjugates, a + d is real.

[21:57:55] <revolve9> Batzy,  (sent a bit ago: ) I'm coming back to that Stokes's flow problem from before.  https://imgur.com/a/ayYuPvP has the qsn and solution. Just starting from fresh, I don't get 1) why they seem to switch from d^2u_x/dy^2 to d^2u_x/dz^2, shouldn't it be consistant? 2) is it y or z in the vertical direction? I thought it should be z because they
[21:57:55] <revolve9> say zero velocity on z = 0,h ? u_x is the component of velocity, u_y is the y component of velocity and x as labelled in the pic is correct.
[22:02:52] <Batzy> im not sure actually

[22:08:40] <z6np-6w> int-e, a-b is an algorithm telling me to perform a subtraction operation
[22:08:48] <int-e> jellie: usually in those proofs you either divide by 0 or you conclude -x = x from (-x)^2 = x^2 (take the square root). Of course the trick is to obfuscate things enough that it isn't immediately obvious... like writing a - b instead of 0.
[22:09:23] <buster> also use pagebreaks to your advantage

[22:13:52] <int-e> z6np-6w: do you need help getting out?
[22:14:17] <Batzy> the answer to "is 0 a natural number" is "sometimes" int-e :)
[22:14:32] <z6np-6w> int-e, this is a topic of special interest but thanks for reminding me to try and not distract you all
[22:14:35] <Batzy> or maybe its "when i need it to be"
[22:15:04] <Batzy> sonny: yeah it doesn't really matter
[22:19:09] <int-e> sonny: of course there's the question why they don't extend the sequence to negative integers. F_(n-2) = -F_(n-1)  + F_n

[22:20:42] <sonny> yeah, you can do that
[22:21:00] <sonny> ok that makes sense why they would choose Z then
