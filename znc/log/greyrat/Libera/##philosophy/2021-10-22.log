[05:48:09] <brigand> plank: i have a problem with your "looking at empathy/sympathy instead of suffering" model. because humans are easily able to turn a blind eye to suffering (or advertisers hiding suffering or manufacturers making suffering near invisible)

[05:52:40] <brigand> xD it's been months ago xD let me check
[05:52:58] *** Joins: arcturus (~arcturus@gateway/tor-sasl/arcturus)
[05:53:24] <brigand> the question was more like: "why do i have to suffer this much? why am i suffering more than others?"
[05:53:38] * thunder nods
[05:53:41] <thunder> thanks
[05:54:17] <brigand> so i have missed the topic, i guess. but i still couldn't stop thinking about it xD
[05:55:01] <thunder> imo pain/pleasure works as a stick/carrot to compel living organisms to pursue their survival needs
[05:55:46] <thunder> pain/pleasure is analogous in this sense to need/satisfaction, and becomes reflected in the psyche as fear/desire
[05:56:19] <brigand> "ever tried comparing your suffering to somebody elses? it just ends up making everybody upset"
[05:56:45] <thunder> because humans and many animals communicate emotionally via empathy, we viscerally feel the suffering of others, as well as their joy
[05:57:00] <thunder> brigand: comparison/choice are the fundamental actions of consciousness
[05:57:08] <brigand> so another user started to talk about utilitarians having hedons and dolors
[05:57:30] <brigand> thunder: good points
[05:57:39] <brigand> i think you're right
[05:58:10] <thunder> the most basic kinds/categories of senses of which we are conscious are space/time, body/psyche, other/self. but these all share reciprocal context and can't really be described in isolatiom from each other (just as comparison/choice and difference/similarity)

[06:00:03] <thunder> or any other of the 6 primary kinds of sense
[06:00:59] <thunder> not sure if this is the correct term, but I believe this is a basic phenomenology
[06:01:59] <thunder> anyhow, as to empathy/sympathy, we feel each other's suffering, and our instinct response (especially in light of reciprocity and our own suffering) is to apply or seek kindness
[06:03:36] <thunder> of course if people can manage to distance themselves from the consequences of their behaviour, they don't experience any empathy directly with those effected by their actions. that and other medical issues (like psychopathy/sociopathy) make it easy for people to be cruel intentionally or otherwise
[06:05:21] <thunder> there are other pathologies too, such as when the satisfaction of need which occurs in the here/now context, is replaced with fear/desire which is not manifest in the present, but always unattainably out of reach. it brings about issues like greed, gluttony, envy, grief, anger and so on

[06:16:19] <plank> im not sure i understand your problem
[06:16:42] <plank> s'alright, most do
[06:17:58] <brigand> the problem is that we can only "measure" people's empathy/sympathy by making them aware of suffering, no?
[06:18:36] <thunder> brigand: this is only one chunk of the puzzle. I personally don't think you can "make" anyone do anything they don't want to do, except by use of force (might), or if they're reasonable, then communication/empathy, or in other words, persuasion.
[06:19:11] <thunder> I don't think empathy or sympathy are amenable to measurement
[06:19:18] <plank> well he mentioned advertisers, who seek to make people do things through manipulation
[06:19:28] <thunder> except perhaps in respect to the feeling of satisfaction of need brought about through kindness
[06:19:34] <plank> im not above manipulating people to pay attention to the suffering of their fellow human
[06:20:12] <plank> and now to walk the dog
[06:20:20] <thunder> plank: that's a recipe for totalitarianism
[06:20:38] <thunder> communication is one thing. coercion another
[06:21:55] <thunder> in a socio-political sense, the pain/pleasure dichotomy can be expressed as might/rights. but rather than say "might is right", I prefer to say "might is custodian of rights", on the premise that "dissent is custodian of consent"
[06:22:00] <brigand> i guess we can also compare humans by their degree of empathy/sympathy. but i don't think it's helpful in reducing suffering (xD)

[06:23:55] <ro-bot-o> brigand meant to say: i guess we can also compare humans by their degree of empathy/sympathy. but i don't think it's that helpful in reducing suffering (xD)
[06:24:01] <thunder> is it a helping hand? a kind word? a shoulder to cry on? or do we need to see them suffer also in order to feel well again?
[06:24:30] <brigand> see who suffer?

[06:24:53] <thunder> the person(s) perceived to have caused or contributed to the suffering
[06:26:10] <brigand> when i say i want to reduce suffering of course i don't want more suffering no matter how much suffering this person has produced
[06:27:21] <thunder> personally, what's become evident to me is that for most purposes the resolution involves bringing awareness back to a here/now context and placing focus on satisfaction of need, rather than worrying about things in another time/place, was or to be.
[06:27:55] <brigand> i disagree

[06:40:09] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:42:24] <brigand> i guess my point is that life is suffering: when you're born, when your body grows, when you fall in love, when you lose someone etc. but the human mind is good at blanking things or else we would go crazy
[06:43:30] <thunder> there's also pleasure, and pain endured for pleasure's sake. wound and balm
[06:45:29] <thunder> empedocles had a lovely way of characterizing it as strife and love. a romantic poetic metaphor for the force of division/repulsion versus that of unity/attraction. I like to say "strife is custodian of love" because it is only through separation (self/other, etc) which makes the force of love possible and gives it it's reason d'etre
[06:46:44] <thunder> for me harmonia is reciprocity
[06:46:58] <vaquero> thunder:  whats the old saying. no one will love you if you cant love yourself
[06:47:46] <thunder> yeah. I guess that's what I was getting at above about bringing awareness back to a here/now context, rather than letting fear/desire drag you around like puppet
[06:48:51] <brigand> "thunder: there's also pleasure, and pain endured for pleasure's sake. wound and balm" i think that's speaking from a privileged pov
[06:49:00] <thunder> other and self are separate. love is always riven with strife. it's just the way things are. love in that sense is eternally unrequited
[06:49:20] <thunder> brigand: how so?
[06:49:32] <brigand> not all beings can "chose to suffer"
[06:50:27] <thunder> when I have a hungry belly, I go looking for food, because the satisfaction of eating it transforms that pain into pleasure.
[06:51:15] <thunder> I could certainly sit there and starve. and yes, there are starving children in many places. but I don't think it's a privilege to survive and enjoy some comforts
[06:52:41] <thunder> to me a privilege is something which is tolerated of the weaker party in a coercive power imbalance. hence might is custodian of rights, because satisfying basic needs should not be a privilege.
[06:53:09] <brigand> what do you mean by "pain endured for pleasure's sake"? how is enduring if you just have to go to the fridge and pick you food?
[06:53:21] <brigand> *how is it enduring
[06:53:44] <thunder> how about working two jobs to put your kids through school so you can feel proud of them and yourself when they are successful in life?
[06:54:01] <thunder> just cherry picking one hypothetical example
[06:54:29] <vaquero> thunder:  elaborate what you mean by privilege being something tolerated
[06:55:13] <vaquero> cause it does seem to be a lot of middle upper class people talking at lower class people about privilege in my view.
[06:55:33] <thunder> I have this lovely cartoon of this cave man and woman. the woman is going out gathering, but the man decides to stay and cogitate for the day. when the wife returns in the evening she asks him if he's gained any insights. so he says, "we have to go pick berries and plants, and hunt all day for food, right?" to which his wife nodds, and he concludes "nature is oppressing us!!"
[06:56:06] <brigand> :D
[06:57:29] <thunder> vaquero: if you come over to my house, I may give you permission to go in the fridge and make yourself a sandwich whenever you like as my guest. that's a privilege. not a right. the homeowner has (at least in most modern cities) property rights which are only offered privisionally to others. similarly, if you are in a prison camp, you may be granted use of the library or some other activity based on good behaviour or trustworthiness.
[06:57:32] <thunder> those are privileges.
[06:58:04] <thunder> a right on the other hand is something which comes about through an equality of power and agreement/consent between two or more parties.
[06:58:37] <thunder> I say "dissent is custodian of consent" because you can only meaningfully consent if you have the right to say "no" without reprisal
[06:58:41] <causative> no, that's not a good distinction
[06:59:15] <causative> suppose you're a caveman and another caveman is going around bashing in heads for fun.  Do you have a right not to have your head bashed in?  He didn't agree or consent not to do it.
[06:59:31] <thunder> might is custodian of rights
[06:59:50] <thunder> if you pick up a strange cat that doesn't want to be held, and ignore it's signs of that fact, what will it do?
[06:59:52] <vaquero> thunder:  do you mean like saying someone who works to afford food is privileged doesnt make sense cause they had ot work to get that food.
[06:59:58] <causative> you said "a right on the other hand is something which comes about through an equality of power and agreement/consent between two or more parties"
[07:00:07] <causative> there is no equality of power, the caveman with the club has more power than you
[07:00:13] <causative> and there's no agreement or consent between you and him
[07:00:28] <causative> therefore, your definition would say that you don't have any right not to have your head bashed in
[07:00:45] <thunder> vaquero: I've explained what my concept of rights is, but haven't elaborated on what agreements might occur in a given society. that may vary, and property in particular presents a devil in the details
[07:01:10] <vaquero> i was still talking about privilege
[07:01:26] <thunder> causative: might is custodian of rights. you have to find a way to level the playing field unless you want to remain a slave
[07:01:52] <causative> what does "might is custodian of rights" have to do with the other things you stated about rights - that they are about equal power and agreement?
[07:02:01] <thunder> if you pick up a strange cat that doesn't want to be held, and ignore it's signs of that fact, what will it do?
[07:02:24] <causative> it may bite
[07:02:27] <thunder> fight/flight .. in other words it will physically assert it's dissent using it's might
[07:02:36] <causative> are you saying that might makes right?
[07:02:43] <causative> that rights are simply whatever you can take by force?
[07:02:44] <thunder> might is *custodian* of rights
[07:03:04] <causative> that seems to contradict your earlier statement that rights arise from an equality of power
[07:03:08] <thunder> if you don't have the means to defend your rights, you have none. only privileges tolerated by those with superior coercive power
[07:03:41] <causative> well, you, personally, don't have the means to defend anything society calls a right
[07:03:46] <thunder> a custodian is a guardian, caregiver, nurturer. think about it in that context and you'll understand.
[07:03:58] <vaquero> thunder:  oh so your saying privilege's are like fake rights
[07:04:10] <causative> if society wanted to, it could lock you up forever and take all your stuff and pull your toenails off
[07:04:12] <thunder> causative: that's correct. but at least I'm aware of what a right is in the first place. that's more than most
[07:04:12] <vaquero> its not really a right because you have no way of ensuring your right without might
[07:04:15] <causative> and there's nothing you could do about it
[07:04:32] <thunder> vaquero: or provisional rights, such as when I let you raid my fridge
[07:04:39] <causative> because whatever "might" you have, you cannot oppose a police force or military
[07:04:47] <thunder> but I can kick you out or say no any time
[07:04:48] <vaquero> causative:  you sure about that
[07:05:07] <causative> yes vaquero , because it does in fact happen that people who have guns get locked up against their will
[07:05:10] <causative> happens all the time
[07:05:18] <thunder> the best way to avoid the use of might is through communication/empathy, which is the genesis of rights
[07:05:20] <causative> if society wanted to, it could do whatever it wanted with these people
[07:05:24] <vaquero> hey if the taliban can do it, so can i
[07:05:45] <causative> oh so now communication/empathy is the genesis of rights
[07:05:57] <causative> thunder, it sounds like you have about four different ideas about rights, none of which are compatible with each other
[07:05:59] <thunder> it's not a black and white proposition. more like a venn diagram
[07:06:21] <thunder> complementary opposition and reciprocity
[07:06:33] <thunder> not absolute opposition and paradox/contradiction
[07:06:53] <causative> here is what rights are. Society says a person has certain rights, if the collective agreement is that it is better for society if that person is granted those rights.
[07:07:01] <causative> that's all
[07:07:13] <thunder> equal rights belong exclusively to individual humans
[07:07:14] <causative> there's nothing inherent about it - nothing about nature - the rights are an artificial agreement
[07:07:45] <causative> society granted the rights, society can take them away if the wind changes
[07:07:59] <thunder> when a one or more people can abrogate the rights of another (by force), equality of rights is only a myth
[07:08:28] <vaquero> causative:  i think this is what its about, you see this exact conversation in wider politics. individual rights are they given by god (or whatever you want to call it) or government
[07:08:38] <thunder> I agree. rights are an artificial agreement. but the main distinction is that in my conception rights cannot in any way partake of coercion except in defence of those same rights
[07:08:44] <causative> vaquero, they are set up by government, obviously
[07:08:51] <thunder> in other words, might is for when people won't take "no" for an answer
[07:08:53] <causative> the government sometimes says the rights are from God, but in fact, it is the government setting them up
[07:09:02] <causative> they just use God as a justification for what they do
[07:10:11] <causative> God didn't reach down and tell us how to organize a market economy - the Bible has very little to say on the subject of security fraud
[07:10:17] <vaquero> heres where i would prob disagree cause depending on your view it impacts your ability to change these rights, like i hear people talk about rights as if they are being given by government when im pretty sure rights were designed not to be given but to prevent them from being taken away
[07:10:24] <vaquero> its not about god creating them
[07:10:27] <causative> the government set all that up, by mutual agreement among the people who have enough power to influence the process
[07:10:35] <thunder> essentially the creation of rights is intended to make use of might/coercion unnecessary
[07:10:41] <vaquero> its about having a barrier that says "we cannot change this" and then attribute whateve deity you want
[07:11:41] <causative> different governments set up different sets of rights for their citizens
[07:11:52] *** Joins: pucara (~i@host77.181-14-159.telecom.net.ar)
[07:12:22] <vaquero> like if i say you have a right to not be raped. thats me saying no matter what i believe you shouldnt be raped, it doesnt mean i believe you shouldnt be raped unless the government change there mind.  i guess it just depends on how you view rights
[07:13:43] <causative> well, there are the rights government says you have, and then there are the rights *you* say you have
[07:13:47] <causative> these are not necessarily the same
[07:14:12] <causative> but if you say you have a right that the government says you do not have, it's not going to be respected
[07:14:42] <vaquero> yeah and thats why i dont want the government deciding if i have rights but unforunately i dont have the might to make that a reality
[07:15:05] <causative> most of the rights you think you have, you only think you have because you've been culturally indoctrinated to think so
[07:15:11] <causative> like the concept of private property or homesteading
[07:15:45] <vaquero> yeah this is a learned culture not one i was born into. trust me no one around me is question the government like i do haha
[07:16:08] <vaquero> here in australia we are a very subservient people
[07:16:20] <causative> when a person asserts "X is a right" the only coherent interpretation of this is that they are claiming "society is better off if we treat X as a right"
[07:17:14] <causative> when the government makes this claim, then X becomes, in practical terms, something guaranteed (mostly) to its citizens
[07:17:52] <vaquero> yeah here we have an "implied freedom of speech"
[07:18:33] <plank> thunder youre saying manipulation is a recipe for totalitarianism?
[07:18:51] <plank> then what do you call the last 80 or so years of western civilization
[07:19:17] <plank> governed as it has been by psychological manipulation via the forces of advertisement
[07:19:27] <thunder> exactly plank. I'm not gonna sugar coat it. we live in a distopia
[07:19:35] <plank> right
[07:19:42] <plank> all im saying is: fight fire with fire
[07:20:00] <vaquero> are we about to start talking mK ultra and tv being used to traumatize people
[07:20:09] <thunder> for the same token though, any utopian ideal is likely to become totalitarian if it's premise rests on trying for people to cooperate
[07:20:10] <plank> theres a lot more that goes into totalitarianism than propaganda
[07:20:21] <thunder> *foce people
[07:20:24] <thunder> force
[07:20:25] <thunder> ffw
[07:20:31] * thunder sighs
[07:20:46] <plank> id much rather get people to want to cooperate
[07:21:01] <thunder> there are different types of moral suasion
[07:21:27] <plank> but the time allotted to persuade people before the various crises facing human civilization cause our undoing is running out
[07:21:32] <plank> and im open to alternatives
[07:21:51] <vaquero> plank:  so sounds like you believe the ends justifies the means type of situation
[07:22:01] <plank> surely, a coercive state is better than the unraveling of society
[07:22:05] <thunder> how many people bother opting out? get into horticulture/permaculture and other stuff which liberates us from dependency
[07:22:23] <vaquero> depends why its unraveling. is the coercive state responsible for the unraveling
[07:22:35] <thunder> if enough people just did their own part, rather than worrying about convincing others, we'd be a lot further along than we are
[07:22:38] <plank> not many, and those who do are still reliant on others for non-food items
[07:23:31] <thunder> I'm not against commercialism/capitalism necessarily either. it has it's place. I can buy a pencil with components from every corner of the planet for cheaper than I can mail a letter down the street by snail-mail
[07:24:32] <vaquero> plank:  i guess where i struggle these types of ideas is. if you do bad things for good reasons your still doing bad things and ultimately you cant be a good moral person if your doing bad things, which leads to the issue of do you want immoral people running society... which we can see where that is getting us.
[07:24:53] <thunder> property rights are a can of worms, but they are important agreements, whether a given society chooses mercantilism or common goods based on shared labour and reciprocity
[07:24:56] <vaquero> personally i have zero ideas how you fix such a system
[07:26:38] <thunder> we live in a system which inherently coerces compromise or death/exile. government extortion (aka: taxation) is endemic, and I don't think too many people would agree with a lot of the spending/salaries
[07:27:51] <vaquero> thats my biggest gripe with taxes, fair enough if you took enough to do the handful of good things you do but we openly watch governments spend ridiculous amounts of money wihtout a care
[07:28:56] <vaquero> Australia encourages crony capitalism, apparently its  good thing allowing politicians to work with business's.
[07:28:57] <thunder> 25% of the canuck population are government employees who essentially produce no contribution to society beyond preventing people from doing what they want, and forcibly taking their money
[07:29:57] <thunder> it's not so much in defence of rights, but in defence of the profit margin of corporations who pay the most in tax
[07:30:06] <thunder> directly or indirectly
[07:31:36] <Crux> Rights? What about duties?
[07:31:47] <thunder> pure laissez-faire capitalism is 100% consensual. two or more parties relinquish something they perceive to have less value than what they receive in return. total perceived value and productivity in the marketplace increases simply by rearranging the furniture in this very efficient way.
[07:31:53] <thunder> moreover it scales to the whole planet
[07:32:11] <thunder> but there's the question of externalities which effect the needs of people and other denizens of the earth
[07:32:51] <thunder> Crux: a right is a responsibility in itself. it means inherently to demonstrate reciprocal respect for the rights of others.
[07:33:08] <vaquero> Crux:  duties are a great tool for coercion
[07:33:20] <thunder> if they are equal, defending your own rights is equivalent to defending others and visa versa
[07:33:27] <vaquero> only time i hear our prime minister talk about being a "good australian" is when his telling us to do something he knows people dont want to do
[07:33:46] <thunder> there's also the question of honour vs dignity culture (or more recently victimhood culture)
[07:34:14] <vaquero> do you guys think we should have some sort of responsibility to our ancestors?
[07:34:29] <thunder> duty seems to me to be more inherent to honour, whereas responsibility is more akin to dignity
[07:34:33] <thunder> imo
[07:35:27] <vaquero> i heard someone bring it up the other day and been thinking about it alot. the idea that my ancestors survived through so much for me to be here, does that mean i have a responsibility to uphold there culture
[07:36:10] <thunder> vaquero: I feel that personally, but it's an individual thing ime. but there's a question of genetic ancestors vs adoptive ancestors vs cultural ancestors
[07:36:48] <thunder> each is deserving of some respect in their own right
[07:36:59] <thunder> but not a slavish obedience
[07:38:53] *** Joins: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[07:39:06] <vaquero> yeah it definitely feels important to me, trying to rectify honouring my ancestors with mixing races with an Asian woman.  already told her that our kids are going to have to learn about italy and korea
[07:39:43] <thunder> I feel that's a good way to go about it. acceptance and integration instead of denial and exclusion
[07:40:53] <vaquero> they have to learn about italy and korea from 2 people who grew up in australia and know nothing about italy or korea so going ot be some interesting times ahead
[07:41:01] <thunder> it's very common in indigenous societies that when another group enters the territory (such as foreign mariners) seeking settlement, the people who land are only given the privilege of a guest, but their children (of mixed heritage) will be full members of the society. this intermarriage prevents conflict, because people are less likely to wage war against their own kin

[09:07:10] *** Joins: mei (~mei@user/mei)
[09:18:37] <causative> the struggle of good government is the struggle of keeping the lying, self-interested slimeballs from rising to the top and doing what benefits them
[09:19:13] <causative> slimeballs by nature gravitate to power - because they have fewer ethical constraints holding them back
[09:19:38] <causative> therefore, we cannot and should not trust the powerful to not be slimeballs
[09:20:21] <causative> the only way to get good government despite the slimeballs, is by implementing many forms of accountability:  so that if the slimeball does something that helps society, he should be rewarded, and if he does something that harms society, he should face the consequences
[09:21:20] <causative> democracy is one form of check on the slimeballs:  if the public is well-informed about what their leaders are doing, they can hold them accountable by voting them out of office if they do bad things
[09:21:52] <causative> but, this only works to the extent the public is well-informed
[09:22:24] <causative> and the slimeballs naturally work their hardest to prevent the public from being well-informed
[09:23:41] <causative> a balance of competing powers is another form of accountability for the slimeballs:  if one power does something wrong, another power can call them out on it, and may have an incentive to, if the powers are truly competing
[09:25:06] <causative> and we can think of more forms of accountability, not yet implemented.  For example, we could hold politicians legally accountable for fulfilling their campaign promises, with jail time if they fail to.
[09:26:59] <causative> this is an interesting proposal for a novel form of accountability, using prediction markets:  https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html

[09:31:12] <thunder> causative: you'll probably enjoy this. https://wtf.tw/ref/ostrom_1990.pdf
[09:34:43] <thunder> here's a summary which boils it down to the 7 prerequisites ostrom derives from her research necessary for stable governance of common pool resources. https://adambrown.info/p/notes/ostrom_governing_the_commons
[09:35:00] <causative> yeah you showed me that before
[09:35:00] *** Quits: bosspotato (~bosspotat@user/bosspotato) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[09:35:08] <thunder> did you get a chance to read it?
[09:35:19] <thunder> granted it's a bit dense
[09:36:32] <causative> I don't really see what's new
[09:36:45] <causative> from the summary it looks like the kind of thing already in place for many common resources
[09:37:35] <causative> i.e. just have regulators and monitors to punish rulebreakers
[09:39:45] <thunder> this is in a local governance context. it basically provides a playbook for any community which wishes to manage common pool resources.
[09:39:54] *** Quits: steam (~steam@user/steam) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:40:47] <causative> well, it sounds good, but what if the regulators and monitors are corrupt slimeballs, who allow regulatory capture?
[09:41:02] <thunder> rule 7 (as per the summary) relates to the coexistance and non-interference between these local direct democratic style institutions and external government (which in many cases will derail the success of a project)
[09:41:25] *** Joins: steam (~steam@user/steam)
[09:41:39] <thunder> causative: that's where the case studies come in. there's no one-size-fits-all way to formulate these local institutions. but there are common prerequisites for them to succeed.
[09:41:59] <thunder> also common factors which impede success
[09:42:05] <causative> well, the important thing is how to tell which regulators are slimeballs and punish them
[09:42:31] <thunder> don't elect them in the first place. representative democracy is only one possible form of governance
[09:43:38] <thunder> the exact form of organization doesn't matter so much as the underlying prerequisites being satisfied
[09:43:44] <causative> if you leave local government to its own devices, quickly you will have town "insiders" who operate by connections and favors. A well-connected business run by somebody who is pals with the town insiders, will get the permits they need in a timely fashion. Other businesses will not.
[09:44:13] <causative> this is obviously, objectively, corrupt
[09:45:11] <thunder> I don't want to cut/paste the summary (even though it's only 7 lines), but it's spelled out that this must be handled somehow. the case studies provide some examples of means that have succeeded or failed.
[09:45:24] <causative> yeah and how shall it be handled?
[09:45:27] <causative> that's the important part
[09:45:39] <causative> recognizing and punishing corruption
[09:45:47] <thunder> that is not a one-size-fits-all problem. it has to be tailored to the needs of the situation
[09:46:04] <causative> and who are we going to trust to tailor it? the corrupt politicians and local businesses themselves, no doubt
[09:46:10] <causative> they won't
[09:46:33] <thunder> the people effected tailor it, because they're the one's involved in creating the institution in the first place as a way of making their collective reciprocity more harmonious
[09:47:05] <causative> that's not how it works - the people affected who go to the same golf club work out an arrangement that benefits just their clique
[09:47:16] <causative> everybody else gets screwed
[09:47:54] *** Quits: ttree (~ttree0@c-73-239-62-159.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[09:48:00] <thunder> there are case studies which demonstrate successful enterprises in her book. yes, there are failures, but there are also successes. both are provide cogent lessons and guidance in approach
[09:48:34] <thunder> f my grammar
[09:48:53] <causative> it's more important to punish the corrupt, than to show them how they should be doing their jobs for maximum fairness
[09:49:04] <thunder> if you say so
[09:49:10] <causative> if you just show them the non-corrupt way to do it, they'll ignore what you say, because it doesn't benefit them
[09:49:41] <thunder> 1. Clearly defined boundaries: Individuals or households who have rights to withdraw resource units from the CPR must be clearly defined, as must the boundaries of the CPR itself.
[09:49:55] <thunder> 2. Congruence between appropriation and provision rules and local conditions: Appropriation rules restricting time, place, technology, and/or quantity of resource units are related to local conditions and to provision rules requiring labor, material, andlor money.
[09:50:09] <thunder> 3. Collective-choice arrangements: Most individuals affected by the operational rules can participate in modifying the operational rules.
[09:50:10] <causative> you don't need to paste the whole thing, I read it
[09:50:20] <thunder> didn't seem so
[09:50:51] <causative> it's what's already being done
[09:51:01] <thunder> examples?
[09:51:04] <causative> if a regulatory commission had a mission statement, that kind of thing would be in it
[09:51:19] <causative> but then they'd go ahead and do the corrupt thing instead, while denying it
[09:51:59] <causative> well, how about the NOAA fishery management
[09:52:49] <thunder> this isn't about "government" in the conventional sense. it's about people who directly know each other and share common resources (like a fishery, irrigation system, forestry project, aquifer, etc) which directly require their cooperation in order to be maintained and equitable.
[09:53:27] <thunder> think more of "governance" than "government"
[09:54:11] <causative> they're assessing "graduated sanctions" against each other
[09:54:16] <causative> that's the act of government, not private enterprise
[09:54:29] <thunder> yeah. the case studies have examples of what that looks like in practice
[09:54:46] <thunder> the pitfalls inclusive
[09:55:34] <thunder> that's how she forms her thesis. by looking at both successes and failures and determining what was present/absent in each case, until the common elements become clear
[09:55:40] <causative> how is a private individual without legal authority going to enact a private sanction?
[09:56:14] <thunder> you have to read the case studies for examples. it's been a while since I read it in full, so I can't quote from the top of my head
[09:56:24] <causative> so you can't give me an answer to something so critical?
[09:56:40] <causative> what happens if someone comes in and says "nah I won't follow your rules" and goes ahead and fishes wherever they want
[09:56:43] <thunder> not atm
[09:56:57] <causative> and however much they want
[09:57:28] <causative> the only possible way to stop them would be through some form of government enforcement
[09:57:51] <thunder> causative: in the case of the aquifers in california, it took arbitration and the threat of litigation to get all the resource appropriators into talks to work out equitable agreement(s)
[09:58:36] <causative> litigation based on what law?  whatever law enabled the litigation for non-compliance is the true authority here, and it's government
[09:58:40] *** Joins: blkshp_a (~blkshp@about/windows/staff/blkshp)
[09:58:41] <thunder> as it stands in our modern countries, the law is most often administered by the state. but that's not a prerequisite for law or enforcement in all societies
[09:59:21] <thunder> some have polycentric law, which is the synthesis between differing legal juristictions who have differing legal frameworks
[10:00:08] <causative> look, somewhere in the chain, there has to be an agent of the government saying "you *have* to find a way to manage this resource, and we will punish whoever goes against the management plan."

[10:00:52] <causative> without that agent of the government there's no way for the agreement of some of the involved parties, to bind the rest
[10:01:40] <causative> what happens if somebody just doesn't sign the agreement?
[10:01:42] <thunder> causative: the early irish (brehon) and medieval icelandic (goðorð) as well as the traditional somali (xeer) have interesting legal/enforcement frameworks
[10:02:05] <thunder> so do the haudenosaunee
[10:02:27] <thunder> the ojibwe in some areas also have really interesting justice modalities
[10:02:47] <thunder> so many different frameworks to look at
[10:02:54] <causative> uh huh and is what I said false in any of them?
[10:04:44] <vaquero> Time to start going back to marrying your kids to your rivals kids to maintain peace
[10:04:52] <thunder> as the guy in that summary pointed out, what ostrom was talking about is local governance. most often directly face to face across the table. if you prefer to call that "a government", sure. but like I said, I don't have examples of enforcement frameworks off the top of my head. something I should spend some time cogitating no doubt. but if you check out ostrom's book, you find plenty of examples
[10:05:30] <causative> it's a government if it has the power to levy fines upon people who did not sign an agreement with them
[10:05:35] <thunder> vaquero: it's a tried and true strategy
[10:05:55] <thunder> causative: or with draw [access to] goods/services
[10:06:37] <causative> what, so their power is the power to advise boycotts?

[14:26:13] <DPA> Maybe that is a mistake. We should just refuse to treat covid in people who refused to take the vaccine. Let them die. They want to make that choice for themself, after all.

[14:26:50] <arryana> if they have a choice to have the vaccine, i agree, dpa

[14:27:54] <DPA> Sure, we can make an exception for cases where it's not possible. But when it is -> let them die.
[14:27:58] <arryana> there are several countries refusing organ transplants to those who won't be vaccinated
[14:28:01] <arryana> and quite right
[14:28:06] <arryana> those organs should go to people who care to live.
[14:28:27] <arryana> why waste resources on people who are self destructive anyway?
[14:29:07] <thunder> all rights in society are at base just variations on the right to say "no" without reprisal

[14:36:06] <pussipupu> I don't think I get a free flu vaccine from the government but I might through work, and if so I'll take it, it's looking like it could be a bad flu season and there's a lot of vulnerable people about
[14:36:09] <arryana> the uk is making many of the same determinations, by necessity
[14:36:40] <arryana> americans are too provincial and ignorant to understand what it means to have socialized healthcare, and make their decisions accordingly, unfortunately

[14:38:54] <pussipupu> I'm only in the warehouse/office so I'm not likely to be a major vector(or likely to get it myself) but better safe than sorry I think
[14:42:28] <DPA> I don't think I'm going to get the flu vaccine. This time, there is much uncertainity on which flu variant is going to be dominant, so it may be more or less effective. A flu is usually managable anyway. So I think it's not worth it.
[14:43:11] <DPA> (The covid vaccine, on the other hand, I took as soon as possible)
[14:43:18] <pussipupu> I've had flu once and that's plenty for me, though my decision is more about the more vulnerable members of the community
[14:43:50] <pussipupu> especially as we don't really understand how much people who've had covid are compromised re respiratory or immune health

[16:30:16] <arryana> if the general global way of living doesn't radically change in the next few years, we're going to spend the next eight decades going into the void.
[16:30:36] <arryana> there won't be those sorts of resources or sciences on the other side.
[16:30:46] <mnemon> yeah, it's a topic that has been sourced for doomsday scenarios and horror movies rather non-stop since the genome was discovered ;)
[16:30:51] <thunder> fun fact: if you move the subcutaneous connective tissue under the scalp of a goat into the direct center of it's forehead, it will sprout a single horn like a unicorn. this is why the unicorn in many ancient images looks like a goat.
[16:31:24] <thunder> you do it when they're still a kid before the tissues afix to the skull
[16:32:31] <arryana> unfortunately, i don't think enough people are going to be willing to give up their unsustainable ways of living.
[16:32:42] <mnemon> many of the "wondrous" creatures of legend were post-mortem handcrafted chimeras, there used to be a thriving trade for 'em
[16:33:01] <pussipupu> I should work on my literary fiction which concerns transgenic folk
[16:33:06] <arryana> oooh
[16:33:06] <pussipupu> the big problem is I such at dialogue :p
[16:33:08] <arryana> i'd read that
[16:33:14] <arryana> most authors do
[16:33:19] <pussipupu> to be fair there are real unicorns
[16:33:28] <pussipupu> pretty fearsome too
[16:33:33] <arryana> it's a rare author whose characters each have a truly distinct voice and perspective
[16:33:44] <mnemon> you mean the whales?
[16:33:46] <arryana> i'd still read it
[16:33:56] <amigojapan> pussipupu: ryhnosoris?
[16:34:01] <pussipupu> always approach unicorns from the front so you don't share them (or don't bother megafauna)
[16:34:11] <pussipupu> Some rhinoceroses
[16:34:37] <mnemon> they just have a spiky nose, no?
[16:35:04] <mnemon> s/nose/snout/
[16:35:04] <ro-bot-o> mnemon meant to say: they just have a spiky snout, no?
[16:37:01] <amigojapan> Rihnocerous seem to have a second small horn too https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.independent.co.uk%2F2021%2F09%2F18%2F12%2FiStock-477602322-rhino.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26auto%3Dwebp%26quality%3D75&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Ftopic%2Frhinoceros&tbnid=uwOYHhUY-E3PSM&vet=1&docid=8pyHcTuTRTAKTM&w=640&h=480&source=sh%2Fx%2Fim

[16:41:08] <pussipupu> It's made of hair, the horn
[16:41:17] <pussipupu> and how many horns they have depends on species
[16:43:03] <amigojapan> I see
[16:43:29] <thunder> anyone aware of how to perform a long term multivariate analysis once the control group has been eliminated?

[19:28:49] <arryana> they asked if he was talking about cream crackers because he was confused, and i had to admit that i had asked why they were called cream crackers.
