[02:46:47] <tinwhiskers> well, blowing your mind means seeing something that is amazing and beyond what you've experienced before. I don't think your "soul" can experience such things.
[02:47:09] <tinwhiskers> toretto: most likely not
[02:47:21] <toretto> I see.
[02:50:29] <tinwhiskers> It really depends what you're saying. A comma introduces a slight pause, perhaps for emphasis, so it may be appropriate to put one before "too" depending how you're thinking about saying it. Most often though, I don't think it should have a comma before it.

[11:17:08] <blkshp> That's the same here. We also have lollies but "lolly" in the UK would be a lolly pop (Ie compressed sugar on a stick)

[11:50:57] <blkshp> pussipupu: will do, what colour?
[11:51:01] <pussipupu> what's hard alcohol?
[11:51:10] <blkshp> Spirits
[11:51:15] <blkshp> liquer
[11:51:17] <raccoon_dog> Liquor or spirits, I imagine.
[11:51:20] <raccoon_dog> Right.
[11:51:41] <raccoon_dog> blkshp: Well, not secretly or covertly, but we do have odd laws about how old you have to be to consume alcohol.
[11:52:02] <blkshp> But is there even a slight stigma about it? 
[11:52:02] <TechTest> why would buying alcohol should be done secretly?
[11:52:10] <TechTest> it is legal, isn't it?
[11:52:34] <raccoon_dog> There are places, though, that frown upon buying alcohol on Sundays. 
[11:52:41] <raccoon_dog> Or even outright outlaw it.
[11:52:51] <blkshp> Well so are sex toys but you wouldn't carry one in the streets or announce you were going to buy one
[11:53:00] <raccoon_dog> O.O
[11:53:18] <TechTest> blkshp: for other reasons though
[11:53:35] <raccoon_dog> https://www.legalbeer.com/liquor-laws-by-state
[11:53:42] <blkshp> Well the video I just watched seemed to suggest going to but 'hard liquer' was a somewhat seedy thing and that it's kept to its own shops and not supermarkets (in some states)
[11:53:47] <TechTest> drinking alcohol is considered cool actually
[11:53:50] <blkshp> I don't care about the laws
[11:53:57] <raccoon_dog> For example, in Arkansas, Sunday and Christmas Day sales are prohibited.
[11:53:59] <TechTest> masturbating is generally considered shameful
[11:54:26] <raccoon_dog> blkshp: I suppose if you're buying in bulk, you may come across as an alcoholic.
[11:54:36] <raccoon_dog> Which contributes to feelings of shame/stigma.
[11:54:45] <TechTest> liquer isn't the stuff used in desserts?
[11:54:45] <blkshp> Interesting
[11:55:02] <raccoon_dog> But if you go and buy one bottle of vodka, I don't think people will be all "OMG AVOID HIM HE'S A WINO!"
[11:55:15] <blkshp> that's liqueur
[11:55:20] <blkshp> liqueur*
[11:55:21] <TechTest> ah
[11:55:22] *** Quits: DevAntoine (~DevAntoin@78.196.234.32) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[11:55:31] <TechTest> what's liquer then?
[11:55:39] <blkshp> Spirits, bottles of whisky and stuff
[11:55:42] <pussipupu> I use whisky in pudding
[11:55:47] <blkshp> It's not a word used in BrE
[11:56:29] <TechTest> do you mean drinks with high vol?
[11:56:40] <MetaNova> high ABV
[11:57:01] <blkshp> Not necessarily all though because you can get over ABV beers and wines and they wouldn't be included.
[11:57:40] <MetaNova> even "high gravity" beer and "fortified wine" aren't considered "liquor" as I generally hear the term used
[11:58:04] <blkshp> "High gravity beer" - googles.
[11:58:18] <MetaNova> blkshp: beer with an above-average ABV
[11:58:27] <MetaNova> Steele Reserve and such
[11:58:44] <blkshp> So the "gravity" is the dissolved solids, new term for me.
[11:58:50] <MetaNova> ("alcohol" mostly implying low-ABV beverages and "liquor" implying high ABV beverages, most commonly, in my dialect)
[11:59:02] <blkshp> Where as all is alcohol here.
[11:59:16] <raccoon_dog> I use "alcohol" for all of it, not just hard liquor (spirits.)
[11:59:18] <MetaNova> to be fair, both terms are used interchangeably
[11:59:26] <TechTest> so apparently hard Liquor is Gin, Vodka, Rum, Whiskey, Tequila and Brandy.
[11:59:35] <MetaNova> it's just that, if either were to imply one or the other, that's how they are distinguished
[11:59:40] <blkshp> You can also "go for a drink" or you can "Go for a drink drink"
[11:59:41] <TechTest> therefore it isn't related to the alcohol percentage
[11:59:43] <MetaNova> but "hard liquor" is unambiguous
[11:59:54] <blkshp> or a "proper drink"
[11:59:59] <MetaNova> (100% of the time means high ABV)
[12:00:02] <raccoon_dog> TechTest: Yes; also absinthe.
[12:00:09] <blkshp> Disgusting stuff
[12:00:12] <TechTest> there are some greek drinks that are higher in alcohol than these
[12:00:15] <blkshp> Set my hand on fire with absinthe
[12:00:23] <raccoon_dog> ... Than absinthe??
[12:00:24] <raccoon_dog> What?
[12:00:33] <MetaNova> blkshp: apparently absinthe is lovely if prepared correctly
[12:00:38] <TechTest> raccoon_dog: never heard of that
[12:00:47] <MetaNova> (strained through sugar cubes and served over ice, I think)
[12:00:48] <TechTest> I don't drink
[12:00:49] <blkshp> There's always aniseed, i hate aniseed with a passion
[12:00:52] <raccoon_dog> TechTest: It's anise flavored. Very high ABV, usualy.
[12:00:55] <raccoon_dog> usually*
[12:01:08] <TechTest> but I have tried wine and a greek drink called "ouzo" as sleep aids

[12:01:27] <TechTest> blkshp: there's uniseed in ouzo
[12:01:33] <blkshp> Also disgusting
[12:01:55] <raccoon_dog> Yeah, ouzo also sounds like a "hard liquor" -- "The final ABV is usually between 37.5 and 50 percent; the minimum allowed is 37.5 percent.[10]
[12:01:55] <raccoon_dog> "
[12:01:57] <TechTest> let me know if you ever visit Greece to serve you some ;P
[12:02:04] <raccoon_dog> That's typical hard liquor ABV.
[12:02:08] <blkshp> VIle
[12:02:24] <TechTest> it actually looks like water, I once drunk accidentally some when I was 12
[12:02:29] <raccoon_dog> Wow.
[12:02:45] <RedCrab> I'm not sure what type of absinthe lights your hand on fire, but all the times I've had it, it's been a nice, sweet licorice-ish flavor. No weird hallucinations or anything, even
[12:03:02] <blkshp> The 85% stuff that's imprted
[12:03:06] <raccoon_dog> That's deceptive, though. 
[12:03:08] <TechTest> ouzo is actually a drink very easy to make, my dad was making and was putting it in empty water bottles 
[12:03:17] <blkshp> Not the 55% stuff for tourists
[12:03:22] <TechTest> that ended in some accidents
[12:03:22] <raccoon_dog> Fruit brandy, for example, is also nice and sweet, but it packs a wallop.
[12:03:27] <blkshp> anything over 65% will light cold.
[12:03:30] <raccoon_dog> And it will knock you on your ass if you drink too much.
[12:03:47] <pussipupu> I want a still but the old fashioned ones are big and dangerous and the modern ones are 'spensive
[12:03:56] <blkshp> boom
[12:04:01] <pussipupu> And I'm not sure how legal it is to make spirits
[12:04:13] <RedCrab> Only illegal if you get found out :D
[12:04:14] <raccoon_dog> You can run into "moonshining" laws if you try here.
[12:04:15] <TechTest> why wouldn't it?
[12:04:34] <pussipupu> AIUI it's illegal but they only actually care if you try to sell it
[12:04:42] <TechTest> it's probably illegal to sell them, but making them for personal use shouldn't be
[12:04:59] <pussipupu> I suspect you're not a lawyer
[12:05:14] <TechTest> I am not 
[12:05:41] <TechTest> but in the end of the day if you'd make some how would they find out?
[12:06:32] <pussipupu> *at the end of the day
[12:06:53] <TechTest> my dad makes drinks at home, puts them in empty bottles, how could anyone know if that bottle has been bought or refilled with a homemade drink?
[12:06:57] <TechTest> thanks pussipupu 
[12:07:01] <pussipupu> And I was talking about legality, not risk, unless you were responding to someone else
[12:07:18] <RedCrab> There are a lot of laws that are not enforced
[12:07:44] <TechTest> pussipupu: I was responding to you, but I get what you are saying 
[12:08:12] <TechTest> there are some laws that never get enforced, so maybe that law also exists
[12:08:44] <RedCrab> Apparently in Arizona it's illegal for you to put a donkey in a bath tub. Good luck enforcing that one
[12:08:58] <blkshp> I don't think "It's ojnly illegal if you get caught" is a thing xD
[12:09:02] * raccoon_dog sees an "ass" joke there.
[12:09:12] <pussipupu> It's illegal for me to call for abolition of the monarchy
[12:09:16] <TechTest> I wonder what's the origin of such laws

[22:25:27] <Voxel> Oh, indeed...
[22:26:12] <Voxel> "Both are wonderful, but some may not find them attractive, enjoyable or that they're worth their time..."
[22:26:22] <kurahaupo> English is quite awful when it comes to expressing logical predicates, as different cultures use the same words to mean different things: (1) negative concordance is assumed by many people, where "not not" is simply a stronger version of "not"; (2) "or" is often implicitly exclusive-or (which is why we write "and/or"); (3) list elision combined with negation is ambiguous

[22:28:10] <kurahaupo> Voxel: that depends; is that an inclusive or exclusive or in the middle 😋

[22:30:33] <kurahaupo> Consistently prefacing lists with "either", "both", "any of", and similar terms helps a lot with point (3) but they sound overly formal so most people avoid them
[22:30:34] <RedCrab> (if my grammar teacher was correct in what she beat into us, anyway)
[22:31:45] <kurahaupo> RedCrab: that depends on whether it's extraordinarily marvelous, or extraordinary and marvelous
[22:32:10] <RedCrab> kurahaupo: that's true, but being there wasn't a comma separating them, it looked like it was playing the part of an adverb
[22:32:43] <Voxel> It was the adv*
[22:32:53] <Voxel> Thank you for the fix!
[22:33:13] <kurahaupo> (5) most native speakers have lost the distinction between adjective and adverb
[22:33:29] <RedCrab> that feels true
[22:33:36] <kurahaupo> leading to yet more ambiguity
[22:34:14] <kurahaupo> only they're not being ambitious, they simply have different mental rules for disambiguation
[22:38:24] <RedCrab> "Are you a man or woman?"  "Yes."  is pretty much broken down into if(person.is(man) || person.is(woman)) return true

[22:46:31] <Voxel> So, in Bash: "return false" or 'return "$( false )"' won't work, but 'return $( [ "$person" = "$man" ] && printf 0 || printf 1 )";'
[22:46:45] <TechTest> it doesn't make much sense, but if you say so, it should be true
[22:48:07] <Voxel> Or better 'return "$( [ "$person" = "$man" ] && printf 0 || printf 1 )";'
[22:48:10] <kurahaupo> Voxel: the shell is an example of a language that lacks a formal Boolean type, but makes do with a small integer instead. 
[22:48:18] <RedCrab> I don't know MIPS, but in most of the high level languages (e.g. Python, Ruby, Java, and that ilk) you can just return the test condition if that's what you're looking for
[22:48:26] <Voxel> Small int? Isn't it a byte?
[22:48:40] <RedCrab> you mean a bit?
[22:48:45] <Voxel> 0-255 is a byte
[22:49:05] <Voxel> Exit code in Linux is a byte
[22:49:08] <RedCrab> (on most machines, it's agreed that) a byte is 8 bits
[22:49:13] <Voxel> Not only Linux, I guess
[22:49:34] <kurahaupo> Voxel: Any POSIX system
[22:49:38] <Voxel> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status
[22:50:33] <Voxel> In POSIX it's exit status, in DOS it's error level heh
[22:51:11] <Voxel> Interesting what will be in quantum computing o.o
[22:51:15] <pussipupu> Why did the Roman empire fall?
[22:51:25] <RedCrab> Voxel: it could be both :P
[22:51:32] <Voxel> pussipupu did it?
[22:51:40] <LuisM14> it didn't have balance :3
[22:51:45] <Voxel> ^
[22:51:50] <Voxel> Haha. Wise words.
[22:52:03] <RedCrab> that actually goes deeper than it appears
[22:52:04] <pussipupu> It's because, lacking the concept of the number zero, they had no way to signal successful termination of their c programmes
[22:52:13] <RedCrab> pussipupu: HA!
[22:52:16] <LuisM14> yep :D
[22:52:20] <Voxel> Holy smokes.
[22:52:22] <Voxel> Nailed it.
[22:53:17] <LuisM14> (i meant, in ref to "deeper" comment)
[22:55:00] <kurahaupo> RedCrab: "return condition" only fails to be completely equivalent in languages that are weakly typed and where (a) the "condition" expression inspects its context (possible in Perl for example); or (b) complicated scenarios involving the returned value being stored, and holding not just true or false but now a reference to an object, and the failure to destroy the object matters
[22:56:54] <RedCrab> kurahaupo: wouldn't that be where scope is involved? If an object falls out of scope, then it's destroyed, otherwise the reference counter should keep it alive even after the function returns
[22:57:21] <RedCrab> (also, sorry, talking about 2 separate things here. Scope and RC)
[22:57:50] <kurahaupo> RedCrab: not in garbage collected languages
[22:58:31] <LuisM14> let me handle my own garbage!
[22:58:44] <kurahaupo> name scope and object lifetime are separate constraints

[23:02:30] <kurahaupo> RedCrab: But yes, the point is, if the object lives longer than expected and that affects the behaviour of the program, that's an edge case where they're not equivalent. But that is extremely unusual

[23:07:24] <RedCrab> kurahaupo: I see. I tend to not code in any languages where I have to worry about that, so it's interesting to hear about
[23:07:54] <RedCrab> also, it's interesting how we have so many programmers in both the English and other non-programming-related channels. Probably due to this being IRC :)

[23:11:08] <kurahaupo> But since reading stuff in English doesn't affect the lifespan of the stuff we read about, in English they should be completely equivalent, except when we have to work around the terrible ambiguities
[23:12:09] <RedCrab> Unless the stuff you're reading about is the sentence for a convict, and you happen to the a judge reading a verdict
[23:13:48] <kurahaupo> Judges are generally among the small portion of the population who understand de Morgan's law
[23:16:08] <kurahaupo> hmm. Given the strong correlation between mathematical ability and musical ability, I wonder if there are any good songs about predicate calculus

[23:35:43] <sepia> in Germany we have DorFuchs making math-songs on youtube, about the pq-formula, geometry and a lot more. 
[23:37:20] <Voxel> <3  Germany
[23:38:59] <sepia> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRblwTsX6hQ 
[23:39:17] <sepia> I think every student in Germany knows the refrain :P
[23:42:08] <Voxel> What do you mean?
[23:44:39] <raccoon_dog> I think you meant "saying" or "idiom" rather than "refrain."
[23:45:23] <sepia> I mean that the best way to remember the pq-formula for solving quadratic equations in math in highschool was to hum the refrain, just like one hums the alphabet to recall the positions of the letters.
[23:45:49] <sepia> So yeah, math and music are connected sometimes : D
[23:45:55] <raccoon_dog> Oh, you mean a mnemonic song.
[23:46:16] <LuisM14> !d noun refrain
[23:46:18] <tinsoldier> refrain — Noun: 1. The chorus or burden of a song repeated at the end of each verse or stanza., 2. (by extension) A much repeated comment, complaint, or saying. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/refrain
[23:46:40] <raccoon_dog> That really isn't a common definition, in particular not one for mnemonic purposes.
[23:46:49] <Voxel> Google: refrain - stop oneself from doing something.
[23:46:55] <raccoon_dog> ^ That is the common definition.
[23:47:15] <sepia> Ah... I didn't know the second meaning.
[23:47:35] <Voxel> sepia, Mozart vs Salieri?
[23:47:45] * LuisM14 only demonstrates
[23:47:52] <sepia> How would you call it in english otherways?
[23:47:58] <raccoon_dog>  <raccoon_dog> Oh, you mean a mnemonic song.
[23:48:11] <raccoon_dog> Since you said you used it to recall the quadratic equation formula.
[23:48:17] <Voxel> Genre: Math rock :D
[23:48:43] <sepia> No, I mean the part of a song, which is repeated after each stanza?
[23:48:53] <LuisM14> refrain it is
[23:49:10] <Voxel> Some might say, the math is nearly everywhere, by the way
[23:49:43] <Voxel> Verse?
[23:49:44] <raccoon_dog> sepia: Oh, that specifically could be called "refrain," but it's not a very 'common' word.
[23:49:58] <LuisM14> sure...
[23:50:29] <sepia> Voxel: oh, and some evil scientists say that it's only an auxiliary science :P
[23:51:18] <sepia> raccoon_dog: I didn't know that. I only knew "refrain" as part of a song, because it's called the same in German. 
[23:51:28] <raccoon_dog> Ah, I see.
[23:51:29] <farn> The common word for it is "chorus", isn't it?
[23:51:42] <Voxel> Verse or chorus
[23:51:59] <sepia> I thought chorus is when multiple people sing a part together?
[23:52:15] <raccoon_dog> No -- you may be confusing that with "choir."
[23:52:33] <raccoon_dog> But yeah, "chorus" is probably a more common word for what you want to describe.
[23:53:08] <Voxel> i.e. Intro -> Verse -> Chorus -> Verse -> Chorus -> Bridge -> Break -> Chorus - Outro
[23:53:27] <sepia> Ah, okay! Came to irc today to ask a question about LaTeX in an other channel and learned some new words here today : )
[23:53:28] <Voxel> + small bridges between every part
[23:54:02] <AndroUser> i believe they're two specific things of a song
[23:55:21] <raccoon_dog> sepia: OK, so here's confirmation: https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/german-english/refrain
[23:55:30] <raccoon_dog> Apparently "chorus" is the translation.
[23:56:06] <sepia> Intro, Outro and Bridge I knew before, they are sometimes labeled in music sheets. But Verse and Chorus are supposed to be common knowledge, it seems ; )
[23:58:56] <sepia> Thank you for the explanations and sorry for the disturbance, I disappear again into real life.
