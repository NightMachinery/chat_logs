[05:14:49] <morlog> um
[05:15:12] <morlog> thats an easy one
[05:15:53] <morlog> it is possible to have your computer see a keyboard as a macropad
[05:16:18] <morlog> really easy in linux and bsd
[05:16:36] <Ultros> non velocity sensitive, no after touch, not the optimal drum controller

[05:17:06] <Digit> wasnt responsive enough tho, the way i did it
[05:17:11] <morlog> all that stuff my mechanicalkeyboard has
[05:18:27] <Ultros> or just plan, and invest in quality hardware because in the long run it will save you money to plan a studio then to wing it

[05:20:44] <morlog> ha
[05:20:49] <morlog> i temeber that
[05:21:20] <morlog> you were really into xmonad when i first met you

[05:24:48] <louipc> i heard xmonad will never go to wayland
[05:26:02] <morlog> it won't 
[05:26:19] <morlog> neither will i3
[05:26:34] <Digit> neither will i
[05:26:40] <morlog> sway is the i3 equivelant in wayland
[05:27:21] <morlog> from what ive experienced in wayland it seems likebits better suited for touchscreens than x11
[05:28:10] <louipc> yea i'm using sway
[05:28:14] <morlog> would see better use in a touchscreen computer than it would on a non touchscreen 
[05:28:28] <louipc> supposedly wayland is default on lot of mobile linux things
[05:28:45] <morlog> yeah, its a bit lighter
[05:29:02] <morlog> x11 is a hulking giant
[05:30:11] <morlog> wayland is the compositor, x11 has to use a third party compositor 
[05:30:19] <louipc> wayland/sway is kinda buggy but it works well enough for daily use now
[05:30:36] <morlog> yeah, I used it on my raspi
[05:30:45] <louipc> i still need to completely configure everything i want
[05:30:58] <louipc> and realising how annoying linux is again
[05:34:56] <morlog> sway is an easy setup
[05:35:24] <morlog> i believe you can use the same conf's that i3wm uses
[05:38:05] <louipc> not really
[05:38:37] <louipc> the auxiliary programs are different
[05:39:20] <louipc> sway itself is an easy setup i guess. but finding/configuring the right programs is less easy

[16:27:10] <artao> perhaps
[16:27:33] <artao> i was playing with this speech program earlier on the C64 emulator. SAM
[16:27:38] <artao> dunno what it stands for
[16:27:53] <artao> but you can use it in phoenetic mode .. which is what i typed up there
[16:28:17] <artao> the numbers change accentuation .. kinda ... pretty much just by changing pitch
[16:28:35] <artao> anyhow .... i'm'a record the speech out of it to use in music
[16:28:49] <artao> no "singing" or "lyrics" just words and short phrases
[16:29:01] <morlog> cool
[16:29:36] <artao> c64 speech was pretty damn good for its day
[16:29:42] <artao> even today to a degree
[16:30:15] <morlog> speech software was a big deal back then
[16:30:18] <artao> learning to write in phoenetic is tricky
[16:31:05] <morlog> they sctually made special boxes that made the soubds
[16:31:07] <artao> my TI-99 4a had a speech synthesis addon module. it too could use phoenetics, but different ones than this SAM program
[16:31:09] <morlog> sounds
[16:31:21] <morlog> yeah
[16:31:24] *** Joins: voltage_ (~voltage@user/voltage)
[16:31:40] <morlog> the ti99 4a was a weird beast
[16:31:41] <artao> and it sounds much better than the c64 speech .... but then, it's addon hardware made to do that
[16:31:49] <morlog> ahead of its time
[16:31:52] <artao> speech synthesis on the c64 is more of a "hack" of the SID chip
[16:32:02] <artao> very ahead of its time
[16:32:12] <morlog> everything was a hack back then
[16:32:15] <artao> i had "underground" software for it that used its TRUE capabilities

[16:32:40] <artao> TI restricted shit too much
[16:32:57] <morlog> it wasnt that
[16:33:11] <artao> their own fucking software -- even cartridges -- didin't even come CLOSE to using its full capabilities
[16:33:14] <morlog> the cost of the ti99 4a was prohibitive
[16:33:23] <artao> had they shown THAT it woulda done much better
[16:33:28] <artao> showed why it cost moar
[16:33:37] <artao> but then, the amiga 1000 was out at the same time too
[16:33:40] <artao> well
[16:33:44] <artao> yes and no

[19:51:09] <artao> i dunno why
[19:51:21] <artao> def. a rich sound. great bass. great leads
[19:51:38] <artao> but i'd personally rather have something else. like an arp 2600 or prophet or something
[19:51:42] <artao> i can't explain it
[19:53:27] <FreeRangeDillo> Moog horn voices are really good too, but ARP excelled at string sounds

[20:02:33] <artao> well ...... the pickups too. and electronics in the guitar
[20:02:35] <artao> and the strings
[20:03:05] <artao> the wood seems to moreso affect sustain. perhaps sympathetic resonances, sure ... but do those get picked up by the pickups?
[20:03:13] <artao> perhaps thru transfer from the wood back to the strings
[20:03:16] <artao> but very low level
[20:03:16] <R2robot> well now you can use a modeler to make it sound like almost any amp/cabinet combo
[20:03:24] <artao> rather

[20:03:37] <artao> want a massive marshall stack? here's the IR
[20:03:48] <artao> abusing impulse responses can be fun
[20:03:56] <artao> remember: they're just normal audio files
[20:04:07] <artao> use whatever the hell you want as an IR for cab sims and reverb
[20:04:23] <artao> the results can be quite unpredictable, but cool .... hit and miss of course
[20:04:49] <R2robot> I had (or still have?) a digitech floor fx unit.  they're fun to play with
[20:04:50] <artao> but one thing that doesn't sound good thru a particular IR doesn't mean other things won't sound good thru it
[20:04:58] <artao> or at least interesting enuf to record for later use
[20:05:04] <artao> idk digitch
[20:05:10] <artao> multi-fx?
[20:05:13] <R2robot> yeah
[20:05:18] <artao> righto
[20:05:25] <artao> i've been considering a Pod-9
[20:05:38] <R2robot> i had this one: https://www.digitech.com/discontinued-products/RP500.html
[20:05:38] <Janet> ^ RP500 (discontinued) | Multi-Effects Switching System & USB Recording Interface
[20:05:42] <artao> however, the Korg Nu:Tekt NTS-1 is the same price-point ... and i already have one
[20:06:02] <artao> three fx .... can be user-created, and there's numerous free ones online to DL
[20:06:19] <artao> but definitely not as flexible as a "guitarists" multi-fx pedal
[20:06:36] <artao> synthesists always be usin guitar fx
[20:07:02] <R2robot> Currently on my wishlist are both the Line6 Helix and the Boss GT1000   boards. :D
[20:07:10] <artao> wait
[20:07:11] <artao> yeah
[20:07:25] <artao> line6 makes the pod 9 yeah?
[20:07:34] <artao> helix looks nice too
[20:07:51] <R2robot> i *think* they do 
[20:07:59] <R2robot> i know htey have some pod branded stuff

[20:09:44] <artao> it DOES have a lot of cab and amp sim stuff i'd likely never use
[20:09:44] <R2robot> but at these prices.. it's not in the near future. lol
[20:09:56] <artao> one generally doesn't run a synth thru an amp and/or cabinet
[20:10:10] <artao> direct line
[20:10:25] <artao> amp and cab would change the sound .... too much?
[20:10:35] <artao> depending what you're going for of course
[20:10:40] <R2robot> depends on what you like i guess
[20:10:41] <artao> it DOES sound interesting, to be sure
[20:10:42] <R2robot> yeah
[20:10:57] <artao> but also -- in my experiments -- tends to make synths sound quite "guitar like"
[20:13:43] <artao> OH WOW
[20:13:54] <artao> playing the underside of the tampourine head! :O
[20:14:02] <artao> i never really considered that

[20:15:06] <artao> did he? nice
[20:15:15] <artao> but then, that's Leslie's
[20:15:22] <artao> that's different than just amp-and-cab

[20:15:35] <FreeRangeDillo> modified with Hi-Watt tube guitar amps
[20:15:40] <artao> but also, a lot of what i've heard sounds pretty direct to board
[20:15:53] <artao> i would guess it was output to both leslies and direct to board
[20:15:58] <artao> easy enuf to do
[20:16:05] <FreeRangeDillo> probably so, artao

[21:36:24] <artao> that literally happened because of the shitty state of Detroit at the time
[21:36:50] <artao> economically and politically. and industrially
[21:36:57] <artao> Detroit was dying and corrupt as fuck
[21:37:21] <artao> <louipx> i wonder how much studio times been burned on just dicking around
[21:37:27] <artao> LOL whomp tons, i'm sure
[21:37:48] <artao> but then, because the dicking around was being recorded, GOOD stuff also got captured and turned into great stuff
[21:38:05] <artao> some people say "always hit record"
[21:38:11] <artao> personally, i disagree
[21:38:28] <artao> for me, if record is running, i "feel like" i have to "do something worthy"
[21:38:44] <artao> but just dicking around, NOT recording? helps me discover my instruments more freely
[21:39:11] <artao> and if something cool happens? THEN hit record and try to do it again
[21:39:13] <LibertyDillo> another attitude is that of Jeff Baxter of the Doobie Brothers who said, 'always roll tape'
[21:39:22] <artao> right
[21:39:27] <LibertyDillo> because you never know when you're going to hit on a good idea
[21:39:36] <artao> .... like i said ... "always record"
[21:39:38] <artao> :P
[21:40:04] <artao> that said, if you hit on a good idea while tape ISN'T rolling, you should be able to just start rolling tape and do it again
[21:40:08] <artao> .... usually ...
[21:40:20] <LibertyDillo> Since I record MIDI (which uses up very little space), it's no skin off my nose to always have it in record mode
[21:40:27] <artao> as long as you don't change a single goddamn thing
[21:40:34] <artao> indeed
[21:40:46] <LibertyDillo> see that's the thing, being able to repeat it ;)
[21:40:50] <artao> yep
[21:41:05] <artao> that's what separates a musician from a diddly wanker
[21:41:07] <artao> lol
[21:41:12] <artao> repeatability
[21:41:29] <artao> now, that doesn't mean you can exactly recreate an improv
[21:41:35] <artao> but do similar
[21:41:57] <artao> improv is improv is improv
[21:42:24] <artao> by definition not re-creatable .... cuz if you recreate it you're not improving
[21:42:54] <artao> LibertyDillo have you ever tried putting that recorded MIDI onto something it was NOT intended for?
[21:43:12] <artao> For instance: Keyboard MIDI to play drums
[21:43:14] <artao> or vice versa
[21:43:35] <artao> it SUPER DUPER depends on the drum kit (or, vice versa, the synth patch)
[21:43:47] <artao> sometimes truly awful, sometimes inspiring and amazing
[21:44:26] <LibertyDillo> Haven't tried that
[21:44:49] <LibertyDillo> you could of course use a different instrument for playback
[21:45:21] <LibertyDillo> like turning what was recorded while playing piano into a string or horn part
[21:45:50] <LibertyDillo> but sure I could see how a percussive piano bit could be turned into a drum pattern
[21:46:14] <artao> give it a try sometime
[21:46:23] <LibertyDillo> interesting possibility
[21:46:24] <artao> misuse instruments and techniques
[21:46:32] <artao> i tell ya man. quite interesting

[21:57:03] <artao> louipx Threads is a British movie about the aftermath of nuke war
[21:57:17] <artao> The Day After is a U.S. movie about up to and immediately after
[21:57:24] <louipx> have you seen salad fingers
[21:57:24] <artao> Threads kinda picks up after that

[21:58:15] <louipx> its a british cartoon about post-nuclear war scarcity/survival and mental dementedness
[21:58:17] <artao> that would be bad, mk
[21:58:43] <R2robot> "Just seconds left now till we feel it's wrath The city is melting, the sky burns red The ocean is boiling, we'll soon be dead People run rabid from the great blast The beast is upon us, it's here at last The streets echo screams filled with fear All through the universe, but no one will hear!"   Good times a'comin!

[22:55:29] <artao> i have a "makeshift" bass trap behind it, but still
[22:55:37] <artao> and turned down the mids on its passive EQ
[22:55:39] <artao> but still
[22:55:46] <artao> a speaker in a corner is NEVER good
[22:55:56] <artao> Not much else I can do tho considering the space
[22:56:19] <artao> I plan to buy some rockwool to make a DECENT bass trap behind that speaker
[22:56:43] <artao> still, i have it "tuned" fairly well. What I hear is generally what I hear on other people's sound systems
[22:56:48] <artao> EXCEPT my dad's

[22:59:30] <artao> They went to church, as they do. So I'm there alone and decide to listen to my own music CRANKED over my dad's system.
[22:59:42] <artao> you gotta listen to your shit over other sound systems
[22:59:56] <artao> so i've got my eyes closed laid back in my dad's chair
[23:00:03] <louipx> does the scarlet have phantom power

[23:01:20] <artao> louipx yes, of course
[23:01:29] <artao> ANY worthwhile audio interface has phantom power
[23:01:35] <louipx> oh good maybe i didnt forget
[23:01:44] <artao> i wouldn't really be able to use my condenser mic without it
[23:01:45] <louipx> i see the button
[23:01:51] <louipx> yes
[23:01:53] <artao> a dynamic mic like the SM57 doesn't need it
[23:02:38] <artao> I have two "beefs" with the Scarlett series. (I have a 2nd gen 2i4)
[23:02:42] <artao> no loopback
[23:02:50] <artao> BIGGEST 
[23:02:57] <artao> not DC coupled
[23:03:14] <artao> but that is purpose specific to being able to send signals to external modular synth gear
[23:03:35] <artao> an issue i wasn't aware of when i bought the audio interface, so that's not really an "issue" with the Scarlett
[23:03:44] <louipx> you put it in the cradle
[23:04:02] <artao> BUT! If using external modular gear is a concern, you don't want a Scarlett
[23:04:05] <artao> ALSO tho
[23:04:09] <artao> their fucking drivers man
[23:04:11] <artao> FUCK
[23:04:28] <louipx> better than roland
[23:04:31] <artao> i mean ........ mostly work fine
[23:04:40] <artao> but when it doesn't work fine? SUPER pita
[23:04:51] <louipx> what modular gear
[23:05:17] <artao> i can't comment on Roland's audio interface drivers, but they sure can fuck off when it comes to integrating hardware and Roland Cloud 
[23:05:26] <morf> s/mod/corn/
[23:05:26] <Janet> morf thinks louipx meant to say: what cornular gear
[23:05:27] <artao> modular gear. you know. the standard
[23:05:58] <artao> MOST audio interfaces have a hard low freq cutoff so as to not damage system components like speakers
[23:06:25] <artao> THAT cuts off the ability to use in-computer stuff for .. for instance ... LFO (low freq modulator) 
[23:06:35] <artao> cuz the audio interface filters out freq that low
[23:06:54] <louipx> iduno im a music production noob
[23:07:04] <artao> as such, to integrate in-computer stuff with external hardware gear, you need a DC coupled audio interface
[23:07:07] <artao> MOST aren't
[23:07:17] <artao> well, that's why i'm explaining it eh
[23:07:25] <artao> I hope i'm making sense louipx
[23:07:27] <artao> questions?
[23:07:30] <louipx> isnt everythign midi controlled
[23:07:34] <artao> no
[23:07:42] <R2robot> when you think your left ear bud is going bad OR worse, you're losing your hearing but it turns out you just had the wrong sized rubber thingy on there so it fit poorly...
[23:07:45] <artao> modular gear is CV (control voltage)
[23:07:45] <R2robot> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
[23:08:03] <artao> actual electrical voltage. no MIDI involved
[23:08:06] <louipx> oh like effect pedal
[23:08:11] <macrobat> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5fweycpVCA
[23:08:12] <artao> 1 volt per octave is the standard for musical notes
[23:08:14] <Janet> ^ RAKTA - RU√çNA - YouTube
[23:08:43] <macrobat> strange engineering choice to have that many volts
[23:08:46] <artao> to control parameters of other parameters it can vary from +/- 1V to +/-10V
[23:08:55] <artao> commonly +/1 5v
[23:09:06] <artao> macrobat HA
[23:09:15] <artao> look at Korg who went their own way
[23:09:18] <artao> Hz per volt
[23:09:32] <artao> at any rate
[23:09:36] <louipx> i still dont know this modular gear
[23:09:43] <artao> eh?
[23:09:49] <artao> modular synthesizers
[23:09:51] <artao> right?
[23:09:56] <artao> you know synthesizers
[23:10:05] <louipx> oh those. kinda
[23:10:07] <artao> modular synths you use patch cables to route signals
[23:10:22] <louipx> do effects pedals count
[23:10:35] <artao> you can send signals from the computer out to those, but only if the audio out doesn't filter out frequencies
[23:10:56] <artao> um ...... no, effects pedals usually don't count, cuz they don't have CV control
[23:11:05] <macrobat> louipx: give VCV Rack a try. it can be fun
[23:11:32] <artao> In an effects pedal instance: Take a basic distortion pedal with just Gain, Tone, and Out
[23:11:39] <macrobat> they want an email adress
[23:11:41] <artao> quite typical for guitar pedals, right?
[23:11:44] <louipx> i got this sucker: https://www.boss.info/global/products/gt-8/
[23:11:44] <Janet> ^ BOSS - GT-8 | Guitar Effects Processor
[23:12:04] <artao> so CV control would mean you could, for instance, control the amount of gain via an external signal
[23:12:17] <artao> make sense?
[23:12:42] <macrobat> I think an external reverb pedal might not be that uncommon for modular users

[23:23:52] <artao> sooooooo many they break "the laws" of economics
[23:23:55] <artao> supply and demand
[23:24:03] <artao> supply is huge, demand is low
[23:24:04] <artao> BUT
[23:24:06] <macrobat> it is typically not something you do
[23:24:17] <artao> the suppliers can't sell enuf cuz the demand is so low, the prices are way too high
[23:24:29] <artao> high supply and low demand SHOULD drive prices lower
[23:24:31] <artao> but NOOOOO
[23:24:35] <artao> not with modular gear
[23:24:57] <artao> small makers want like 200usd for a simple fucking oscillator or filter
[23:24:59] <artao> fuck off
[23:25:19] <louipx> then a new maker is born
[23:25:27] <artao> exactly
[23:25:36] <artao> and every maker thinks they can sell their shit
[23:25:45] <artao> and then wants 200 for it
[23:25:58] <louipx> R2robot: hows ur guts feeling
[23:26:05] <R2robot> Busted!
[23:26:11] <louipx> lol

[23:53:34] <artao> well ....... depends on the def. of "insane"
[23:53:54] <macrobat> ucanhas the magic bus, or 100 English pounds
[23:53:58] <artao> insane doesn't mean ...... i mean ..........
[23:54:11] <artao> to do what he's doing?
[23:54:17] <artao> that's not "sane"
[23:54:22] <artao> it's mad
[23:54:25] <artao> BUT
[23:54:32] <artao> what is the world gonna do about it?
[23:54:35] <artao> FUCK
[23:54:40] <macrobat> MAD is a thing
[23:55:01] <sublim20> ehhh
[23:55:01] <artao> just a few months ago he did that anti-sat test which put just about everything in orbit in danger
[23:55:07] <sublim20> used to be a thing, then iron dome was invented
[23:55:11] <artao> fuck it all he thinks
[23:55:19] <artao> and the world did nothing but scold him
[23:55:32] <artao> what else CAN we do about something like that?
[23:55:38] <artao> sanctions only hurt the people
[23:55:43] <artao> they never work
[23:55:45] <artao> FUCK
[23:55:46] <sublim20> so yeah, launch them bad boys, theres a good chance you can shoot down the incoming missiles
[23:55:55] <artao> not really LOL
[23:56:00] <artao> 10k mph
[23:56:21] <artao> ever play Missile Command?
[23:56:51] <artao> IS putin mad (insane) enuf to pre-emptively nuke?
[23:57:04] <artao> or, "lesser" .... to use tactical nukes?
[23:57:33] <artao> i think the latter is totally within his ....... him
[23:57:51] <artao> and if tac nukes, how long before it goes strategic nukes?
[23:58:05] <artao> tac nukes are one thing
[23:58:14] <artao> low yield, low radioactivity
[23:58:30] <artao> you don't want your own soldiers charging into a radioactive zone
[23:58:52] <artao> MOST people don't realize nukes don't HAVE TO BE radioactively dangerous
[23:59:19] <artao> a nice hydrogen bomb can fuck shit up big time with little radioactive residue
[23:59:48] <artao> OTOH a dirty cesium bomb can leave all the structures intact but kill all the people and leave a nuke wasteland for 1000yrs
