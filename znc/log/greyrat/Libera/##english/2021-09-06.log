[00:03:20] <StayHungry> twb: I refer to de facto ability to exercise self-government without external control

[00:13:40] <huf> hmm, how come the swashes arent loose?
[00:13:46] <huf> it's been a very long time since anyone's buckled them
[00:17:18] <CuriosTiger> twb: "Having a sovereign" and "being sovereign" are two different concepts.
[00:17:52] <CuriosTiger> The United States is sovereign in that no higher authority can tell the US government what to do, save by agreement of the US government (ie. treaties)
[00:18:19] <twb> CuriosTiger: that's de jure for all nation-states
[00:18:42] <CuriosTiger> twb: Yes, it is. I think StayHungry's argument was that without a military to defend that sovereignty, it doesn't exist.
[00:18:58] <CuriosTiger> I disagree with that argument, for the record, but human history is replete with "might makes right".
[00:19:00] <twb> I was looking at the definitions and I think it feels "off" to me because sovereign = "ultimate power" whereas autonomy/autarchy = "self-rule"
[00:19:19] *** Tobbi__ is now known as Tobbi
[00:19:23] <CuriosTiger> In politics, however, "autonomy" tends to be used about subnational forms of independence.
[00:19:46] <CuriosTiger> For example, the Seminole Nation of Florida is "autonomous", but ultimately still answers to US law. They are not sovereign.
[00:20:09] <twb> I can understand that argument, but I'm not 100% convinced
[00:20:51] <CuriosTiger> You don't need to agree with the position, but that is how the word "sovereign" is customarily applied to nation states, even if that sovereignty isn't vested in a king or queen.
[00:21:13] <twb> fair
[00:21:24] <StayHungry> de jure there are, of course, 200+ sovereign countries, but de facto Bolivian's president plane was illegally grounded in Austria whenever US whistled, and there are no shortages of examples with poorly justified extortions, invasions, renditions, and sanctions.
[00:21:51] <CuriosTiger> Indeed. Ukraine's sovereignty over Crimea wound up meaning little when Russia decided they wanted it back.
[00:22:03] <twb> CuriosTiger: twice!
[00:22:34] <CuriosTiger> and while examples like Iceland and Costa Rica do exist, those nations are dependent on help from allies if a hostile force were to attempt an invasion.
[00:23:07] <CuriosTiger> This puts me in the difficult position, as a pacifist, of recognizing the need for a military, although I want no part of it.
[00:23:21] <CuriosTiger> A very apt example of a "necessary evil", as it were.
[00:23:31] <twb> Well you could make the same argument about needing farm subsidies
[00:23:45] <twb> a defense force isn't special in that sense
[00:23:51] <CuriosTiger> I could, and I have, particularly as I come from a family of farmers.
[00:24:03] <CuriosTiger> It is though
[00:24:37] <CuriosTiger> When the nazis showed up at our family farm, what did their property rights mean?
[00:24:38] <CuriosTiger> Zero.
[00:25:02] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: not sure you are well familiar with the Ukrainian crisis, but given your diligence and curiosity, you will figure out the intricacies if you want to :)
[00:25:07] <twb> wasting 1 crore/year on soldiers vs. wasting 1 crore/year giving in-country farms free money so they can compete with cheaper foreign farmers
[00:25:14] <CuriosTiger> When my grandfather was imprisoned by the nazis, his constitutionally guaranteed right to a fair trial was ignored. As was, indeed, the entire constitution.
[00:25:39] <twb> the threat in the first case is "dudes from another country attack"; the thret in the second case is "dudes in another country stop sending food"
[00:25:48] <CuriosTiger> twb: Political questions of funding are a separate debate from these more fundamental questions of justice.
[00:26:24] <CuriosTiger> I'm not really sure what you're getting at.
[00:27:03] <CuriosTiger> Is your argument that countries can meddle in each other's affairs financially as well as militarily?
[00:27:14] <twb> I'm just saying that independence isn't PURELY about having more nukes than anyone else
[00:27:18] <twb> CuriosTiger: exactly
[00:27:27] <twb> Or rather logistically
[00:27:33] <CuriosTiger> Oh, I absolutely agree.
[00:28:02] <CuriosTiger> StayHungry's argument was that the ability to defend territory was a precondition for hanging onto it.
[00:28:16] <CuriosTiger> I think everyone recognizes that defense alone is not sufficient.
[00:28:17] <twb> Crimea is actually a relevant case since, AIUI, .ua could de facto cut off both food imports to .ru, and gas exports from .ru to europe
[00:28:56] <CuriosTiger> They could cut off gas imports, but Russia could in turn cut off gas exports to the Ukraine, which they are completely dependent on.
[00:29:25] <CuriosTiger> as for food imports, the Ukraine controls one trade route, but not all. And on the gas pipeline issue, I seem to recall I read somewhere that Russia was working on a pipeline to Germany bypassing Ukraine
[00:29:30] <CuriosTiger> something through the baltics or something
[00:29:36] <twb> yeah

[00:30:12] <CuriosTiger> the question also gets thornier because Crimea was historically Russian in the past, and there's a large ethnically Russian minority there that wants to be part of Russia
[00:30:35] <StayHungry> CuriosTiger: in Crimea they are majority
[00:30:39] <CuriosTiger> Even so, I believe taking it by force was wrong.
[00:30:51] <StayHungry> it was not taken by force
[00:31:00] <twb> StayHungry: didn't russia basically bus in enough people to make them a majority
[00:31:04] <CuriosTiger> Kiev would seem to disagree with you, StayHungry.
[00:31:12] <twb> StayHungry: the same way that the kingdom of Hawai'i was stolen by USA
[00:31:39] <CuriosTiger> Hawaii was flat out annexed because US businesspeople wanted to control the plantations there and screw what the natives wanted
[00:31:52] *** Quits: magla (~gelignite@55d40548.access.ecotel.net) (Quit: Stay safe!)
[00:31:58] <CuriosTiger> but Hawaii is another example of sovereignty not meaning squat in the face of a more powerful foe
[00:32:52] <CuriosTiger> (Heck, there's a good argument to be made that the US itself came into existence by military aggression, although that's only part of the story)
[00:33:29] <CuriosTiger> "The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence. Westerners often forget this fact, non-Westerners never do."
[00:34:06] <huf> yep, despite all the crazy random shit going on back home, they were able to keep up the pressure for centuries
[00:34:07] <twb> CuriosTiger: also during WWII most countries had their industrial infrastructure wiped out, and USA didn't
[00:34:11] <huf> using any crack
[00:34:19] <CuriosTiger> twb: That enabled the US to become a superpower, yes.
[00:34:41] <CuriosTiger> the prior superpowers were severely weakened by the war.
[00:34:50] <twb> oh I guess you meant "the west" to include like all of the most-favoured-nation status stuff and scramble for africa 1
[00:35:08] <twb> opium wars
[00:35:19] <CuriosTiger> "The West" in this context really means Western Europe and its cultural descendants

[00:38:10] <CuriosTiger> although personally, I would include Latin America as well, at least historically. Spain and Portugal's conquistadors applied the exact same organized violence as the French, the English, the Dutch etc.
[00:38:28] <CuriosTiger> That's usually defined as "western hemisphere" rather than "the West".
[00:38:30] <StayHungry> Ukraine was never a country before USSR collapse, it's not Estonia's case. so one should see it as a former region where the same Russian people live, some of them speak slightly different, but that's all. In particular, there was a Russian military base in Crimea all this time. the Nazis in Kiev staged a coup in 2014 during the absence of the president in the capital, which the people in the Crimea did not agree with and held a 
[00:38:30] <StayHungry> referendum on reunification under the protection of the military who were there.
[00:38:33] <CuriosTiger> but I see your point.

[01:25:34] <StayHungry> twb: regions cannot 'switch' fundamentals. to better understand this episode, it is necessary to understand how the collapse of the USSR occurred. it was the gathering of the rotten party elite, who pulled the regions and called them states. Tatarstan didn't make it to the pie section, so while Russia was busy with economics and Chechnya, some hotheads in local parliaments tried to win the support of the West with initiatives such 
[01:25:34] <StayHungry> as switching to Latin.
[01:28:28] <twb> Well what I'm seeing like like 5 languages all switched to Latin script, except the one inside Russia

[03:21:16] <blackop> or this one : http://paste.debian.net/1210570/
[03:21:32] <blackop> ok
[03:23:02] <blackop> now? http://paste.debian.net/hidden/77988266/
[03:24:03] <tinwhiskers> *The* first call of X will be held on Z at Y. In case a majority is not reached *a* second call...
[03:24:39] <blackop> what is Y ?
[03:24:47] <tinwhiskers> the location in this case
[03:24:53] <blackop> hmmm
[03:25:10] <tinwhiskers> oh, you had that in earlier versions
[03:25:50] <blackop> it was for clock
[03:25:53] <blackop> not place
[03:25:55] <tinwhiskers> oh. ok
[03:26:06] <tinwhiskers> that's fine then :-)
[03:26:07] <blackop> is that necessary to put AT ....... for clock?
[03:26:09] <StayHungry> twb: makarrata is surely an important step to reconciliation… do you personally encounter any racism?
[03:26:16] <blackop> i removed at my last text
[03:26:23] <tinwhiskers> I'd leave it in, but I guess it doesn't really matter
[03:26:58] <blackop> is this fine? "ON ANY ISSUES OR MATTERS ON THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF  X "
[03:27:11] <blackop> issues or matters sound to me same
[03:28:57] <tinwhiskers> yeah, issues is a subset of matters I would say, so just saying "on any matters relating to" is fine.

[03:45:44] <twb> I guess Murdoch never did Zersetzung for the Stasi at least
[03:46:45] <twb> There was a recent thing here where Murdoch said "people read google/fb fake news instead of my fake news, so I lose money.  Google and FB should pay me for the money I'm losing!"
[03:46:47] <StayHungry> twb: but what about online consumption of news, or it's not particularly in demand? 
[03:46:56] <twb> And he made the government do that
[03:47:46] <twb> Basically the australian government said "google, unless you pay Murdoch some money, we will make it illegal for google to show any news in australia"
[03:48:18] <toretto> But does Google "shows" news? 
[03:48:24] <twb> toretto: in search results and things
[03:48:27] <toretto> It only indexes.
[03:48:41] <twb> toretto: e.g. if you search for "moldova election"
[03:48:47] <toretto> Yeah, that's indexing.
[03:48:53] <toretto> It doesn't "own" the content.
[03:48:56] <twb> toretto: well that would have been illegal

[03:59:30] <StayHungry> twb: do you get fined for downloading via torrents?
[04:00:19] <toretto> Any sane guy would use a VPN
[04:00:22] <twb> I never have
[04:00:33] <twb> But I haven't used torrents for anything except Debian for years
[04:00:52] <StayHungry> twb: no movies, no (audio)books, no games at all?
[04:01:06] <twb> It's not like Lem or Strugatsky brothers are writing any new novels
[04:01:12] <StayHungry> :D
[04:01:16] <toretto> StayHungry: All countries fine against copywrite violations.
[04:01:37] <twb> I used to get oreilley textbooks from a site in .ua
[04:01:37] <toretto> (specifically for DMCA)
[04:01:38] <tinwhiskers> I don't bother with a vpn for torrents. Our laws are very weak
[04:01:44] <twb> now I can afford to buy them
[04:01:52] <toretto> tinwhiskers: Where are you from?
[04:01:56] <tinwhiskers> we get three warnings, so plenty of chance if they catch on. No warnings yet.
[04:02:00] <tinwhiskers> New Zealand.
[04:02:11] <toretto> Hmm, don't know much about NZ
[04:02:20] <StayHungry> twb: if you need anything to watch, let me know ,)
[04:02:28] <toretto> But you'd be fined in CA
[04:02:32] <tinwhiskers> I have a friend who got 2 warnings, but he was full on- 24-7 torrenting
[04:02:43] <LjL> 18<22toretto18> (specifically for DMCA) ← this is nonsense. the DMCA is a US-specific law, so saying that "all countries" fine for it is absurd
[04:03:30] <tinwhiskers> If the TPP had gone ahead we would have had DMCA here too, so that's the one good thing Trump gave us.
[04:03:41] <twb> DMCA is part of TPP2
[04:03:44] <toretto> LjL: No, I didn't corelate DMCA with "all countries"; I explicitly mentioned "all countries" have one way or another to charge against copywrite violations.
[04:03:48] <tinwhiskers> oh. bums
[04:03:52] <twb> ...I think
[04:04:01] <twb> It was definitely in TPP1 which was leaked
[04:04:05] <LjL> toretto, that's not how the word "specifically" works in my book, but okay
[04:04:06] <twb> I don't know for sure about TPP2
[04:04:35] <twb> In any case, US interpretation of copyright is built into WIPO which affects essentially all countries
[04:05:43] <StayHungry> it does not apply at the household level here, but sometimes it happens in the corporate sector
[04:06:37] <twb> StayHungry: I bet it would if you were doing industrial-scale sharing
[04:07:38] <twb> StayHungry: one of the ISPs here doesn't say "torrenting is banned", but their Acceptable Use Policy basically says "if we sort our customers by internet usage, and you're in the top 5%, we can disconnect your internet with no warning"
[04:09:34] <LjL> which technically would mean they can disconnect everyone, as long as they disconnect the top 5% first and then the remaining top 5% and then...
[04:09:45] <StayHungry> LjL: :D
[04:10:00] <twb> LjL: exactly
[04:10:05] <darsie> Colud they really disconnect everyone that way?
[04:10:13] <darsie> What if there's one customer remaining?
[04:10:21] <twb> darsie: that's infinitesimals math
[04:11:27] <LjL> my former mobile carrier has a completely byzantine fair use policy, not so much about the internet (it might have that too), but like, calls must be 60% to other customers of the same carrier, i must not receive more calls than i make, more than some other percentage of calls cannot be to a single carrier...
[04:12:20] <LjL> then they say the application of those fair use rules is not automatic - well whew? or not whew? they basically say "we can kick you out whenever we like" while disguising it as *you* using them "unfairly"
[04:12:23] <darsie> LjL: Did they ask money for that service?
[04:12:36] <LjL> darsie, mobile service is certainly not free
[04:13:33] <darsie> There's free mobile service in Austria.

[17:00:53] <gneeriiloeepdeer> if I ask 'why do women love to jump to conclusions so easily?' Im afraid nobody will answer the question in good faith, but start questioning why am I such a macho pig, in effect, jumping to a conclusion :D. Is there  more neutral way to ask this question?
[17:02:01] <gneeriiloeepdeer> example: I want to be friendly with a woman, because we are alone and there is, literally, nothing else to do till a coworker comes back. I am in no way attracted to this woman, she assumes Im flirting with her...
[17:02:39] <blkshp> Yes, don't generalise half the population.  Add the word "some"
[17:03:01] <gneeriiloeepdeer> ok...
[17:03:12] <TechTest> yeah most women think you are flirting with them if you are nice
[17:03:19] <TechTest> *some

[17:03:23] <TechTest> well, many 
[17:03:31] <gneeriiloeepdeer> is 'most' acceptable blkshp ?
[17:03:37] <TechTest> that's why I'm not very nice
[17:03:44] <blkshp> No
[17:03:53] <gneeriiloeepdeer> don't be nice, be sincere and do your job
[17:04:22] <blkshp> You could even be less of a 'pig' if you said people.
[17:04:53] <gneeriiloeepdeer> women who believe men are flirting with them just by starting a conversation are conceited, entitled and.. is this a red flag?

[17:05:18] <gneeriiloeepdeer> blkshp, except that this doesn't apply to men, because if I start a conversation with a man, he doesn't assume I want to get into his pant
[17:05:42] <gneeriiloeepdeer> Im going with some
[17:05:44] <TechTest> though generalizations are not nice, I do think it's true that women are more likely to think someone is flirting with them 
[17:06:04] <blkshp> No, and people will get the implication without you saying it. If the woman you're talking about is the subject of the conversation you can put forward the idea without appearing like a bastard!
[17:06:52] <gneeriiloeepdeer> wht bothers me is that there is always this subtext that I must be a macho pig for saying what life has taught me. This behavior, I have only seen it in some women

[18:58:14] <[itchyjunk]> Hello. I am supposed to find 2 additional examples of syllogism used in the text. I wanted to ask if this one counts. “take equals from equals and equals remain.”
[18:58:29] *** Joins: nvmd (~nvmd@user/nvmd)
[18:58:48] <[itchyjunk]> The examples given were of the type "If A implies B and B implies C then A implies C"
[18:59:32] <[itchyjunk]> But this could be thought of as "If A = B then A-C = B-C"
[18:59:39] <[itchyjunk]> so not sure if this counts as syllogism

[21:34:36] <trollcat> have you ever heard the letter H pronounced with an H?

[21:35:26] <gneeriiloeepdeer> hh?
[21:35:41] <trollcat> haitch
[21:36:29] <trollcat> the letter haitch instead of the letter aitch
[21:37:24] <huf> It is, however, a feature of Hiberno-English,[3] as well as scattered varieties of Edinburgh, England, and Welsh English,[4] and in Australia and Nova Scotia. 
[21:38:16] <blkshp> haych and aitch

[21:44:04] <gneeriiloeepdeer> well, you sure honor your name trollcat 
[21:44:28] <blkshp> o.O
[21:45:09] <trollcat> I also saw that lots of people were surprised by that pronunciation, judging by the comments below the video
[21:45:32] <huf> gneeriiloeepdeer: how on earth is this trolling or catting?
[21:45:39] <trollcat> however it sounds like it's not as uncommon as I thought
[21:45:39] <huf> or ollcing?
[21:46:15] <blkshp> it definitely not unusual here in the UK
[21:46:19] <blkshp> Especially the north
[21:48:54] <trollcat> I have a better question
[21:50:26] <trollcat> when I listen to something with headphones I can understand a lot of what people are saying in general, when I listen to the same stuff without headphones I have a really hard time
[21:50:38] <trollcat> the question is: why? What is my problem?
[21:51:17] <blkshp> Ambient noise
[21:52:23] <trollcat> of course without headphones you are going to pick up other noise, have a lower volume, a worse signal, whatever. But I don't think this is normal anyway
[21:53:01] * blkshp recommends a doctor and suggests that you can hear it and understand with headphones so it's not in our remit :P
[21:55:06] <trollcat> my guess is that either a need more practice with listening, or I need to learn more vocabulary (not necessarily new words, it could be idioms, expressions, etc.)
[21:55:16] <blkshp> hearing aid?
[21:55:46] <blkshp> Sorry, it's the nick, it sets me off ;P
[21:56:23] <trollcat> no, it's not a matter of bad hearing, otherwise I'd have the same problem in my native language
[21:56:39] <trollcat> I haven't started trolling already, I'll troll later, LOL
[21:56:40] <blkshp> No, no.
[21:56:58] <blkshp> Because in your native language your brain compensates the loss of clearity.
[21:57:00] <blkshp> clarity*
[22:01:20] <trollcat> exactly, and why does that happen? Because you know the language well enough to be able to choose the most sensible option, like "they must have said THAT", and nothing else
[22:01:52] <trollcat> but I'm not sure it's only a matter of knowing the language (that is, vocabulary, expressions, etc.)
[22:03:01] <blkshp> wtih egnlish the wrods dnot need to be in teh rgiht odrer bceuase yuor biran feixes it.
