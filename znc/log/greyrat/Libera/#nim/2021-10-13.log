[05:40:47] <FromDiscord> <reilly> I am still exactly no closer to figuring out why I can't get this to compile. It's not obvious to me whether it's the case that `imgui.h` is failing to be imported, or it just can't find definitions for those types for whatever other reason (even though they're in `imgui.h`!!!)
[05:41:46] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> check the nimcache
[05:41:53] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> see what the C code it's outputting is doing
[05:50:31] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> reilly, you're using imgui which is a c++ library right? and you're compiling with `nim c` rather than `nim cpp`
[05:50:56] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> unless you're using cimgui
[05:52:16] <FromDiscord> <reilly> I can't use `nim cpp` because it won't compile on MacOS (supposedly due to trying to link Obj-C code)
[05:52:49] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> well if you can't use nim cpp, you probably shouldn't use a cpp library, use cimgui instead
[05:58:31] <FromDiscord> <reilly> Well, you can compile C code as C code and C++ code as C++ code, then link them together after the fact. Is this not something I can do?
[06:01:55] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> You can, but the header is a cpp header
[06:02:15] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> Unless it only exposes a c api
[06:03:20] <FromDiscord> <reilly> Well, the ImGui extension I'm trying to use (ImGuiFileDialog) says it has a C api.
[06:22:19] <FromDiscord> <reilly> sent a long message, see http://ix.io/3BAo
[06:25:22] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> Where are ImGuiWindowFlags defined?
[06:25:34] <FromDiscord> <reilly> The same error still happens if I edit `#include <imgui.h>` to `cimgui.h` in `ImGuiFileDialog.h/.cpp`.
[06:25:35] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> And is nim complaining that it can't find them or C?
[06:26:02] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> Does your generated wrapper define them?
[06:27:56] <FromDiscord> <reilly> `ImGuiWindowFlags` is defined in `imgui.h` and `cimgui.h`. It's the C compiler (gcc) that is complaining. My wrapper does not define them, but they are already defined in NimGL ImGui, so I just `import nimgl/imgui` at the beginning of my wrapper.
[06:29:21] <FromDiscord> <reilly> Although, now that you mention it, removing `import nimgl/imgui` from my wrapper makes it complain about undeclared identifiers for `ImGuiWindowFlags`, `ImVec2`, and `ImVec4`... the same three types that GCC is giving me grief over. That's probably not a coincidence.
[06:31:34] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> Isn't ImguiFileDialog C++ ? It probably used ImGui by itself, right?
[06:31:40] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> Then it won't work with cimgui
[06:31:49] <FromDiscord> <reilly> It says it has a C api, though.
[06:32:07] <FromDiscord> <reilly> The README says, and I quote: "C Api (succesfully tested with CimGui)"
[06:32:13] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> Hmm
[06:36:01] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> It may be that the library doesn't work as advertised
[06:36:29] <FromDiscord> <impbox [ftsf]> I've had success with nim and cimgui but i haven't tried any imgui extensions
[06:38:50] <FromDiscord> <reilly> Well, the hope was that ImGui extensions would give me some future-proofing for free, and that all I'd have to do is figure out how to use them once and then it would be easy going forward. That's no good if I can't figure out how to make it work the first time around...
[06:40:26] <FromDiscord> <reilly> This is especially annoying because I've spent, quite literally, all day making a build script to try to automate managing these non-nimble dependencies, but if I can't use them, then I've just wasted a whole day doing what I could just do with `nimble build`.
[06:42:43] <FromDiscord> <reilly> I can't even continue working on the problem anyway... I need to be well-rested for my PSAT tomorrow. I'm gonna lose sleep thinking about how annoying this is, though.
[06:43:57] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> i can try checking if it works on linux with cimgui
[06:44:46] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> ah well, obviously it won't work for you if you can't compile C++ code together with C code in your project since imguifiledialog written in C++
[06:44:48] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> (edit) "ah well, obviously it won't work for you if you can't compile C++ code together with C code in your project since imguifiledialog ... written" 03added "is"
[06:45:19] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> or maybe i'm wrong, but ".cpp" file extension strongly suggests it's C++ code :)
[06:48:22] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> @reilly have you seen https://github.com/aiekick/cimgui ?
[06:48:25] <nrds> <12R2D299> 4GitHub: 7"c-api for imgui (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) lookat: https://github.com/cimgui for other widgets"
[06:49:38] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> So basically since you can't compile C++ and C in the same project you need to build cimgui with imguifiledialog embedded into it, and this work seems to be exactly that
[06:50:00] <FromDiscord> <Yardanico> but of course then you'll also have to add the imguifiledialog definitions in nimgl (or importc yourself)

I need to use `tm_simulation_state_o` as the return type for start, but I need to create a type for it.  I think the way the C lib is using it is as an opaque pointer.  So I can probably cast it safely.

[21:39:36] <FromDiscord> <wholesomedonut> I've debated learning Nim. I'm gonna ask the stupid new-guy questions, and yes I've RTFM at least a little bit. I like talking to people more than reading pages.I see that Nim can compile down to C/++ and web code. What kind of code is more prevalent so far in your experience writing Nim? Do more people use it as a systems language a la C/++ or Rust, or do they use it as a mother language for building web app frontends?
[21:40:34] <FromDiscord> <Rika> C
[21:40:39] <FromDiscord> <wholesomedonut> And also.. aside from the newish book that's shown on the website, which I'm thinking of getting, are there any other tutorials, proofs of concept or examples of Nim based projects you lot would recommend a newbie to look at?

[21:46:27] <FromDiscord> <treeform> Compiling to C++ or JS is more rare. JS might even win over the C++ code.

[21:47:05] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Which is possible, but harder to do than C
[21:47:17] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Mainly because there are not so many tools for automatically wrapping C++ libraries

This doesn't work seemingly because a library I'm wrapping is written in C++, even though the readme says it has a C api... Compiling with the C++ backend fails because the default gnu++14 option isn't compatible with Objective-C.
[22:15:23] <FromDiscord> <reilly> It's trying to compile ObjC because the MacOS Cocoa headers or whatever are ObjC, and it needs those to put pixels on the screen.
[22:15:26] <FromDiscord> <treeform> That sounds like you want separate compile and link steps like like a make or a bash file.

[22:15:45] <FromDiscord> <treeform> (edit) 04removed "like"
[22:16:11] <FromDiscord> <treeform> You need to compile everything in like objc++ mode.
[22:16:49] <FromDiscord> <treeform> Have you tried naming your .m files with .mm extention?
[22:21:12] <FromDiscord> <reilly> Clang tries to find cocoa_init.m, but fails since it's been changed to .mm.
[22:25:43] <FromDiscord> <reilly> So, I can make Nim transpile to C++, and that should all get dumped in the nimcache folder... then what?

[22:27:03] <FromDiscord> <reilly> I've already been trying to use a nake file for this stuff, so I'm just going to keep working with that.
[22:27:59] <FromDiscord> <Qaz> How would I elevate priviliges in Windows so I can run a command as admin?
[22:28:23] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Like in a malware sense?
[22:28:44] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Or do you mean like, right click -> run as admin
[22:28:54] <FromDiscord> <Qaz> Yes
[22:29:26] <FromDiscord> <Qaz> I'm guessing I could run the exe as admin itself and do it that way but I don't want to
[22:30:21] <FromDiscord> <Qaz> I would like for the … wants to … to system popup to appear.
[22:30:41] <FromDiscord> <Qaz> (edit) "…" => "[program]" | "…" => "[do x]"
[22:30:59] <FromDiscord> <Qaz> Is there a procedure for that?
[22:31:16] <PMunch> You want to have the "Program X is requesting to run as admin" prompt?
[22:31:18] <nrds> <06Prestige99> Ah I see what you mean. Not sure, I don't use windows
[22:31:20] <PMunch> Or whatever that is
[22:31:20] <FromDiscord> <Qaz> I found a forum thread but it was from 6 years ago seemingly without a solution
[22:31:25] <FromDiscord> <Qaz> In reply to @PMunch "You want to have": yes
[22:32:38] <FromDiscord> <reilly> In reply to @reilly "So, I can make": Should I be only transpiling, or should I assemble too? (`--compileOnly:on` vs `--noLinking:on`, no linking either way, but the latter transpiles and assembles)
[22:32:44] <FromDiscord> <reilly> (edit) "`--noLinking:on`," => "`--noLinking:on` -"
[22:34:04] <PMunch> @Qaz, probably something like this: https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/main/Samples/Win7Samples/com/uac

[22:54:44] <PMunch> Hmm, is in not possible to have openArray as arguments to an async procedure?
[23:02:21] <FromDiscord> <juan_carlos> Use seq
[23:04:34] <PMunch> Can't create openArray slices into an array with a seq..
