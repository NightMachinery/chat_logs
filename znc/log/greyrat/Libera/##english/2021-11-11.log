[00:12:08] <placeb0> I don't think there's an objective way of saying that something or someone is bad

[00:20:21] <mdogg> Family does matter, though.  Why would that hurt you?
[00:23:10] <Guest52> family hurts me because both sides avoid eachother
[00:24:48] <mdogg> I think in your case, it's probably best to have a conversation with your sister or whomever you are trying to address.  Letters and emails are fine in some cases, but when it comes to close friends and family, some issues are better discussed in person or at least over the phone rather than by writing something.
[00:26:08] <mdogg> Even in business - I can't tell you how many emails I've been looped in to after they've been getting ripe for a week.  And all that is needed is a simple conversation or conference call to put everything to rest.
[00:26:22] <Guest52> well the thing is I hate my sister. when I addressed this with her last time I got banned from her phone.
[00:27:05] <mdogg> Guest52－ If your sister is not going to be receptive to your feelings, then there really is no point on addressing her.
[00:28:00] <mdogg> There is nothing that can be done when the person you want to speak with is not going to be receptive at all.
[00:28:31] <mdogg> Perhaps someday you guys can just agree to start over.
[00:29:03] <Guest52> So I have no choice but to 70%hurt over this. Life sucks.
[00:29:18] <mdogg> What do you mean 70%?
[00:29:38] <Guest52> I mean like 7 out of 10 pain being felt
[00:29:45] <mdogg> Ooh

[00:34:34] <mdogg> That way you aren't trying to rush in to anything and you're letting her know that you are willing to set aside everything that transpired in the past.  But you have to genuinely want to do that.  And if she doesn't want to do that, then you need to accept that.

[00:42:57] <mdogg> Guest52－ Well, we aren't social workers here.  You've got my suggestion and I'm afraid that's all I can offer.
[00:43:36] <varde> 'it' refers to 'this' and 'that'. Per se, in the first example I give I am talking improper and in the second proper. "It was Sunday", "It was Sunday morning in June". It was Sunday, is the this element, and morning in June the that element.
[00:43:44] <Guest52> my only recommendation is write a whole poetry book about the experience
[00:44:15] <varde> What is it was Sunday if not referring to this and what is morning in June if not referring to that.
[00:44:53] <varde> Sentences like it was Sunday are improper because they are unfulfilled.
[00:45:40] <varde> No way to round it, it is missing a major factor, Sunday is not a thing, Sunday and some specifics are required. It was baby

[18:25:39] <Me-me> I'm trying not to be a troll about any of this. But I'm not going to back down from my position just because you're angry.
[18:25:46] <huf> you dont have a position
[18:25:50] <pussipupu> I can't parse the “raised amongst a language not your own” bit unless you're somehow assuming everyone who disagrees with you is both American and not a native Anglophone
[18:25:53] <huf> you have a shit opinion based on ignorance
[18:26:13] <huf> as I said, flat earther but in linguistics
[18:26:17] <pussipupu> Which would be both very wrong, and require a very bastardised definition of “Anglophone”
[18:26:52] <Me-me> Sure I do: My position is: (1) America, after the Revolutionary War, revised their language in an attempt to defy their former oppressors. (2) This was adopted, and is now American English. And (3) this constitutes a bastardisation of language.
[18:27:18] <huf> none of this is factually true
[18:27:22] <Me-me> I don't know what part, exactly, you're taking issue with. Mostly I know that your position is: (1) I am dumb. (2) [Some position of mine] is as dumb as flat-earth theory.
[18:27:35] <huf> 2 I'm sure of
[18:27:40] <huf> 1 you're making increasingly clear
[18:28:08] <Me-me> So I mean. I can't really address either of those points, due to (1) being immaterial to my position, and (2) being nonspecific, and also insubstantice.
[18:28:10] <pussipupu> “more correct” isn't really meaningful in this context
[18:28:22] <Me-me> s/insubstantice/insubstantive/
[18:28:23] <chat> Me-me meant to say: So I mean. I can't really address either of those points, due to (1) being immaterial to my position, and (2) being nonspecific, and also insubstantive.
[18:28:28] <huf> I've been very specific in which stupid shit I object to
[18:28:35] <huf> you're just pretending you dont understand
[18:28:38] <Me-me> No, you've just said "that's wrong" over and over.
[18:28:44] <pussipupu> “more conservative” can be, but minor spelling reform won't make much of an impact on that for the dialect as a whole
[18:28:55] <Me-me> Neither of us have provided any sources, mind. You're countering what I assume you assume are my sources with what I assume you assume are obvious sources.
[18:28:57] <huf> also the spelling reform didnt change the way people spoke
[18:29:02] <sbin> Me-me: it would take you like 30 seconds to just... google it and learn the actual reason why AmE removed additional letters
[18:29:25] <sbin> spoiler: rebellion had nothing to do with it
[18:29:31] <pussipupu> dminuoso: Sorry yes, I lived most of my life from birth in England so my dialect of English is reflective of that 
[18:30:49] <Me-me> Look, I'd really love to stay, but I do have to run. Best of luck, I hope you haven't become too stressed out from my disagreement with you.
[18:31:33] <huf> yes, please dont come back
[18:31:53] <huf> this level of science denialism and linguistic bigotry is really bad on a language help channel
[18:31:57] <pussipupu> You're still making unfounded assumptions about where people are from by the way
