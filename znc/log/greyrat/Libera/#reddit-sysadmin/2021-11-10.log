[01:16:07] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> guess i could look at writing docs
[01:16:16] <rpifan> i feel like this will happen in my new job a lot
[01:16:22] <rpifan> it really feels like a low intensity job

[01:16:33] <TurkeyGibby> ?
[01:16:35] <rpifan> but at lesat itll be partially from home, otherwise i think itd be hell

[01:17:14] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> i start my new job in 2 weeks :)
[01:17:15] <rpifan> and the previous person in my role was an HR type person not an IT person
[01:17:22] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> oof
[01:17:27] <rpifan> so it sorta points to a job that will be so easy it will be boring
[01:17:37] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> or it'll be a total mess
[01:17:42] <HurdyGurdyBurdy> and you'll be very busy for a good while

[01:28:36] <Activ8> I can't be bothered to train users up to the new windows 11

[05:13:50] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Studies show that theres a specific region within the eyes of a male fly called the love spot. It is pretty much used for detecting and chasing female flies. This spot is located within the dorsofrontal region of their eyes. This is typically used to detect small target motion, however, males also use it to stay locked onto potential mates during aerial pursuit.

[06:42:25] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Like butterflies, flies can taste food using their feet! This is all down to taste receptors (chemonsensilla) being located on their lower legs and feet. When a fly lands on a tasty meal, which can be anything from animal feces to your lunch, they will often wander around to give their next meal a good taste before consuming it.

[06:46:57] <cryptic1> !flyfact
[06:46:57] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Ever wondered why it‚Äôs so difficult to swat a fly? Well, it‚Äôs pretty much down to their quick reaction times and their agility. House flies are able to process what they see and react accordingly at amazing speeds. To put things into perspective, our brains process around 60 images a second, whereas a fly can process around 250 in a single second.

[12:59:07] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Flies like to eat manure, which is animal poop, or old garbage. Some of the germs from these materials can stay on their feet or mouth parts. When a fly lands on your food, those germs get on your food. Super disgusting!

[13:49:53] <Hunterkll> no fuckin' clue where that idea came from

[13:50:05] * Hunterkll been dual booting win/lin for over 20 years....

[13:51:36] <Hunterkll> some other factor was at play then
[13:51:38] <lancehead> And so have other people 
[13:51:58] <Hunterkll> literally the first answer
[13:51:59] <Hunterkll> Windows will overwrite the boot sector whenever you install it, upgrade it to a new version, or use tools like bootrec /fixmbr, bootrec /fixboot, or the older fdisk /mbr.
[13:52:02] <Hunterkll> nothing to do with updates at all
[13:52:13] <Hunterkll> like I said, the installer (or tools that you're explicitly telling to overwrite the mbr with)

[13:52:24] <Hunterkll> "In general, install Windows first, then Linux. The boot sector will stay put until you do one of the things above."
[13:52:38] <Hunterkll> windows updates have not been that issue
[13:53:17] <lancehead> Hm, might've had it happen to me when I upgraded to win10 then. Again, it's been a long time; I might just be misremembering

[14:48:33] <sd> 05<V‚ÄãALOS> i'm installing linux & reinstall windows after i made a backup of everything
[14:49:11] <sd> 05<V‚ÄãALOS> reinstalling* sorry i'm running off like 10h sleep in the past 3 days
[14:49:35] <csws> what distro
[14:49:48] <sd> 05<V‚ÄãALOS> i'm debating between arch and manjaro
[14:49:52] <DrZak> Australian man uses pocket knife to fight off crocodile
[14:49:53] <sd> 05<V‚ÄãALOS> i know arch is a pain to set up
[14:49:59] <sd> 05<V‚ÄãALOS> but i like the idea of it
[14:50:02] <csws> arch and... arch but easier? lol ok
[14:50:10] <DrZak> i am thinking there's a pig involvement missing for it to be truly australian
[14:50:10] <csws> manjaro is fine I guess
[14:50:16] <sd> 05<V‚ÄãALOS> what would you recommend?
[14:50:18] <csws> not sure how easy arch is on its own
[14:50:26] <csws> idk last distro I used for a meaningful amount of time was manjaro
[14:50:30] <sd> 05<V‚ÄãALOS> i mean there's an installation guide on the website
[14:50:32] <csws> someone here was bitching the other day but it worked fine for me so shrug
[14:50:44] <csws> yeah but manjaro is nice as everything is all nicely setup
[14:50:54] <csws> like themed and whatnot
[14:51:03] <sd> 05<V‚ÄãALOS> oh yeah for sure
[14:51:10] <thegodsquirrel> Just install OpenBSD xD

[15:07:17] <thegodsquirrel> Best is a relative term.  It has the most market share, but I wouldn't call that a metric of best.
[15:07:32] <xe0n> its just a tool, one of many..
[15:07:52] <thegodsquirrel> For me its all about the use case.
[15:07:57] <xe0n> ^
[15:08:24] <csws> @ <¬Ø‚Äã\_( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)_/¬Ø> why isn't templeos the best operating system?
[15:08:28] <Activ8> If linux supported everything I would have moved businesses over.  It's just a system to do a task 
[15:08:41] <Activ8> cost analysis n all that
[15:08:46] <thegodsquirrel> Nice csws 
[15:09:07] <Activ8> it might be the best os to some people
[15:09:24] <Activ8> best use case that is
[15:10:04] <Activ8> I'm so bored had no tickets and no calls today so far phones are 100% working I have tested
[15:10:07] <Activ8> no emails either
[15:10:13] <thegodsquirrel> Supports practically every software, is portable, relatively low learning curve, folks have been using it for decades
[15:11:34] <thegodsquirrel> The only reason macOS is where it is is because they found a niche of customers and built up from there, working to make their OS simple, clean, and easy to use.
[15:12:24] <Activ8> at the end of the day they all work
[15:12:30] <Activ8> doesn't matter which one you use
[15:12:39] <Activ8> if it works for what you want
[15:13:13] <thegodsquirrel> Well, when I was using Linux as a daily driver, as an inexperienced user, it was very easy to end up with a borked OS
[15:13:33] <thegodsquirrel> Which is a non-starter for your average user
[15:14:21] <Activ8> you could easy get away with it for office use but the difficulty comes when integrating it in with login system and security policies.  The engineers need to know that side.
[15:14:43] <Activ8> a single pc, no problem
[15:15:04] <thegodsquirrel> And in most offices, people expect Office products.
[15:15:07] <Activ8> when you got like 100/1000s of em or more then that's another story.
[15:15:11] <Activ8> exactly
[15:15:20] <thegodsquirrel> Now, I will admint that VDI helps solve this problem
[15:15:23] <Activ8> licencing ain't cheap but it's what people know
[15:16:01] <thegodsquirrel> Linux machine and RDS to Windows desktop is way less expensive than Windows on everything
[15:16:08] <Activ8> I think I'll clean my desk, needs a little dusting
[15:16:22] <Activ8> we use VPN RDP for remote desktop in all use cases
[15:17:22] <thegodsquirrel> My point is that the endpoint OS becomes moot if its just an access point and not a workstation
[15:17:37] <Activ8> indeed
[15:18:11] <xe0n> windows rds is expensive...
[15:18:16] <xe0n> and running a pc is cheaper in most cases
[15:18:17] <xe0n> lol
[15:18:31] <xe0n> avd\w365 might be able to assist, but still expensive
[15:18:37] *** Quits: Aoyagi_raventop (~yags@user/aoyagi) (Quit: qat)
[15:18:45] <Activ8> one of our clients has hyper-v desktops with 4gb ram allocated to each remote desktop
[15:18:48] <xe0n> ive done several rds\thin client setups and the cost in the end is more than a pc lol
[15:18:48] <thegodsquirrel> We had a site that was all BYOD and they just accessed the RDS with MFA and it was 2 servers with everything in one place without the hassle of all the rest
[15:18:50] <Activ8> the server has about 1tb ram in it
[15:19:44] <thegodsquirrel> Now, that pesky firewall rule bug did cause us some hassle for a few weeks until it was figured out
[15:20:14] <Activ8> we are lucky as a msp we don't use shit stuff clients usually always go or the better project
[15:21:20] <thegodsquirrel> Yeah, my old boss was a Windows/Dell/solid Enterprise gear because it is cheaper in the end in most cases
[15:21:43] <Activ8> we have two teams, field engineers and remote engineers
[15:22:31] <thegodsquirrel> I would hate to support a large site with all Linux machines
[15:22:46] <Activ8> in the main HQ is where all the monitoring systems are so we have boss man monitoring but we can monitor remotely
[15:23:15] <Activ8> I would as well unless the same solutions where put in place for everything to just work
[15:23:27] <thegodsquirrel> Yeah, our main gear was in a colo and the boss worked from home, but same concept

[15:24:11] <Activ8> I don't get to touch the hardware that's the field engineers responsibility 
[15:24:26] <Activ8> I'm the remote guy, we use RMM N-ABLE 
[15:24:40] <thegodsquirrel> Oh nice, Nable is good
[15:25:03] <Activ8> I love it
[15:25:15] <thegodsquirrel> We had Bomgar for remote support as well
[15:25:17] <Activ8> far too simple and I like the remote cmd function as well
[15:25:24] <thegodsquirrel> ^^^
[15:25:27] <Activ8> remote shell is sweet
[15:25:39] <thegodsquirrel> alert alert C:\ is getting full
[15:25:42] <Activ8> i usually do most stuff via command while a user is working
[15:25:53] <Activ8> we get that alert on the odd occasion not often though
[15:25:54] <thegodsquirrel> uses remote cmd to run my sneaky clean up script
[15:25:56] <csws> bomgar is good
[15:26:03] <Activ8> we make sure our systems have 256gb+ main os
[15:26:06] <csws> lol
[15:26:16] <csws> the C: drive alerts are endless at my place
[15:26:18] <Activ8> erm we usually set the alert to about 30gb
[15:26:29] <Activ8> maybe once a week 1 system has an issue
[15:26:33] <Activ8> not a problem really
[15:26:37] <csws> usually only have 40 or 50 GB on the C: drive
[15:26:40] <Activ8> ouch
[15:26:44] <Activ8> too low
[15:26:47] <csws> yeah big time
[15:26:49] <thegodsquirrel> Yeah, I didn't set the alert thresholds...
[15:26:55] <csws> and they have an infatuation with thick provisioning so they hate extending disks
[15:26:58] <Activ8> our remote desktops have 50gb allocated to them each
[15:27:02] <Activ8> in hyper-v
[15:27:08] <Activ8> that's just for office and a mapped drive
[15:27:25] <thegodsquirrel> We only had one client with Wyse machines and I hated supporting that place..
[15:27:49] <Activ8> lol I worked at a place with WYSE machines. 
[15:27:56] <Activ8> weren't too bad
[15:28:25] <Activ8> the main thing is the boxes crashed mainly and froze sessions but once they got used to rebooting their box it was ok

[15:35:23] <Activ8> I don't think a plugin would cut down on spam if people want to send it I think they would just vpn to the uk so might just add a capture
[15:35:28] <Activ8> that probably should reduce the spam
[15:35:43] <csws> what kind of spam?
[15:35:49] <csws> can you run akismet to try and deal wit hit? setup captchas?
[15:37:15] <Activ8> it's just basic spam but with mail.ru as the sender address I'll stick a capture on for now see if it reduces it or stops it.  Don't think it's a bot but never know
[15:37:37] <csws> hitting a contact form?

[16:08:17] <estranger> haha

[17:20:29] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: The first recorded use of flies in a criminal investigation was in 13th-century China. By studying the fly population and their larval stages at a crime scene, these buzzing creatures help forensic scientists estimate the time of death. The fly species most helpful in forensic investigations include house flies, blow flies, and flesh flies.

[17:21:11] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies aren‚Äôt really fans of rushing to the hospital to give birth. Their chosen method is rather disgusting as well. House flies will lay their eggs on items such as feces, rotting carcasses, and decaying fruit. Why is this? Well, it‚Äôs mainly to provide the larvae (maggots) with something to eat when they hatch.

[17:24:19] <mistiry> !flyfact
[17:24:19] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Ever wondered why it‚Äôs so difficult to swat a fly? Well, it‚Äôs pretty much down to their quick reaction times and their agility. House flies are able to process what they see and react accordingly at amazing speeds. To put things into perspective, our brains process around 60 images a second, whereas a fly can process around 250 in a single second.

[19:46:08] <TurkeyGibby> remember, small words, pretty pictures. No more than 7 words per bullet and a max of 7 bullets
[19:46:17] <sintax> comic sans font
[19:46:21] <PublicWiFi> you speak from experience
[19:46:23] <PublicWiFi> ? xDD
[19:46:26] <TurkeyGibby> ofc
[19:46:45] <TurkeyGibby> I got that advice years ago, and it rings true to this day
[19:46:45] <PublicWiFi> do I need to put scary pictures of hackers known as 4chan?
[19:46:53] <sintax> can't hurt
[19:46:54] <SirSceptalot> don't forget neato burrito transistions between slides
[19:47:03] <PublicWiFi> you know, the hooded figures with matrix code on their screens
[19:47:09] <PublicWiFi> SirSceptalot: ++
[19:47:25] <PublicWiFi> then a yubikey flies in and stabs the hacker and he dies, yubikey saves the day
[19:47:31] <TurkeyGibby> let me see if I can find a slide of a preso I did that had exactly that, PublicWiFi 
[19:47:38] <PublicWiFi> please

[19:48:56] <TurkeyGibby> legit preso
[19:49:08] <PublicWiFi> hahaha
[19:49:54] <PublicWiFi> TLP, isn't that brit'ish
[19:50:01] <TurkeyGibby> nosir
[19:50:14] <TurkeyGibby> https://www.cisa.gov/tlp
[19:50:40] <TurkeyGibby> if you're interested in the security space, need to be aware of that/how it works
[19:50:51] <PublicWiFi> oh I swear it was british
[19:50:55] <TurkeyGibby> nerp
[19:50:58] <PublicWiFi> okay cool I'll read up on it!
[19:51:03] <TurkeyGibby> its stupid simple
[19:51:14] <PublicWiFi> so this is just terror levels
[19:51:16] <PublicWiFi> for cybersecurity
[19:51:17] <TurkeyGibby> no
[19:51:18] <PublicWiFi> xD
[19:51:23] <TurkeyGibby> this is for information sharing 
[19:51:31] <PublicWiFi> oh rip, lemme read it and stop being a silly guy
[19:52:12] <PublicWiFi> so this a sort of thing you use during a breach incident?
[19:52:28] <PublicWiFi> like, "don't be telling everyone anythign yet cause we don't know the full details" type deal?
[19:52:48] <TurkeyGibby> basically: TLP:RED is super sensitive, usually only talked about/shared in a controlled manner like a meeting, TLP:AMBER is for distribution within an org/maybe with some others, GREEN is for wider audiences like clients or partners, and WHITE is public 
[19:53:02] <PublicWiFi> I see
[19:53:32] <TurkeyGibby> well, usually, you have the details but you're trying to keep the information from creeping into the wrong hands
[19:53:41] <PublicWiFi> want to provide a real world example of each from a netsec perspecitive? 
[19:53:43] <PublicWiFi> ohhh I see
[19:54:14] <TurkeyGibby> like, for an example: You have 4 IOCs, a hash, an IP, a domain, and some commands a TA always uses during an attack
[19:55:19] <PublicWiFi> IOC? Indicator of compromise? 
[19:55:38] <PublicWiFi> man the more I read into netsec the cooler it is
[19:55:49] <TurkeyGibby> the hash you might want to classify TLP:AMBER and give it to trusted people. You'd GREEN the IP and domain and give it to colleagues, and the commands you'd TLP:RED so you build a playbook on the bad dudes
[19:55:57] <TurkeyGibby> yeah Indicator of Compromise 
[19:56:06] <PublicWiFi> interesting, I see!
[19:56:40] <PublicWiFi> if you ever do a public netsec talk be sure to send me the stream link :D
[19:56:52] <TurkeyGibby> that would mean I would dox myself :P
[19:56:56] <PublicWiFi> rip
[19:57:09] <PublicWiFi> i can doxx myself too and we have MAD, mutally asssured dongers
[19:57:10] <TurkeyGibby> but I usually do 3-4 speaking engagements a year

[19:58:23] <PublicWiFi> it just sucks cause most traditional "teaching" professions get paid shit

[19:59:03] <PublicWiFi> you're kind of teaching though!

[20:15:54] * TurkeyGibby waves to NinjaStyle 
[20:16:05] <PublicWiFi> okay lets play a game
[20:16:07] <PublicWiFi> and pick your brain a little
[20:16:30] <PublicWiFi> lets say you've been asked to pen test a new site. What's the first few things you look for?
[20:16:36] <TurkeyGibby> depends
[20:16:48] <TurkeyGibby> OSINT the shit out of it
[20:16:56] <catbeard> what's the scope
[20:16:56] <TurkeyGibby> enumerate services 
[20:17:04] <TurkeyGibby> scope is to get in
[20:17:11] <PublicWiFi> yup
[20:17:17] <catbeard> i mean what's IN scope
[20:17:18] <PublicWiFi> do you usually engage in social engineering at all?
[20:17:21] <TurkeyGibby> ofc
[20:17:29] <catbeard> can you break into their email, phish, or just attack http
[20:17:29] <TurkeyGibby> SOCENG, Phishing, on-site
[20:17:33] <PublicWiFi> do you do that after you've tried technical avenues first?
[20:17:40] <PublicWiFi> or just kinda do it all to get a feel of all areas
[20:17:52] <TurkeyGibby> we go for whatever we feel is the weakest, depending
[20:18:01] <PublicWiFi> gotcha
[20:18:05] <catbeard> can you pose as one of their vendors
[20:18:09] <TurkeyGibby> YES
[20:18:21] <PublicWiFi> so would you come back at a later date a try again, hopefully finding the original way in patches and look for new ways?
[20:18:27] <TurkeyGibby> jesus fucking christ, this is a pentest not some fucking sysadmin trying to moonlight as a pentester
[20:18:30] <PublicWiFi> is patched*
[20:18:38] <PublicWiFi> LOL
[20:18:43] <PublicWiFi> so you go hard
[20:18:46] <PublicWiFi> that's dope as fuck LOL
[20:19:08] <TurkeyGibby> if we need to break in after hours we will
[20:19:17] <PublicWiFi> we had "AT&T" show up once and want in our network closet. After he realized they had to ask me about it first he dipped
[20:19:45] <PublicWiFi> OSINT framework looks sick
[20:19:51] <PublicWiFi> but also a little hard to organize wtf
[20:20:02] <PublicWiFi> this can get huge quick
[20:20:02] <TurkeyGibby> I used to use the ladder trick to get into where I needed

[20:20:36] <PublicWiFi> dude your job sounds so fun
[20:21:02] <TurkeyGibby> couple that with a high-vis vest and a hardhat that looks like its used for more than playing the part
[20:21:26] <TurkeyGibby> not saying its worked 100% of the times I've done it, but its worked when I needed it to
[20:22:02] <PublicWiFi> it would be interesting if you "categorized" each successful pen test and kept some anon data onit
[20:22:10] <PublicWiFi> to see the most common ways people fail
[20:22:11] <TurkeyGibby> we keep data on it
[20:22:12] <TurkeyGibby> heh

To put things into perspective, our brains process around 60 images a second, whereas a fly can process around 250 in a single second.
