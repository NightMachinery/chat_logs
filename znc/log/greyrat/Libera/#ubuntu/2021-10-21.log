[00:53:02] <happosade> Hi! Is it possible to enforce custom keyboard layout on new ubuntu 21.10? On 21.04 I never got it working on wayland, but on xorg it worked. After the update firefox won't find display anymore on X (but I'd like to move to wayland, as X froze every time timeshift took a backup, and that was super annoying)
[00:53:33] <happosade> I'd like to have this change: https://github.com/happosade/dotfiles/blob/master/xkb/custom

[02:08:08] <cuddylier> I am preseeding Ubuntu 20.04 and am trying to set a custom volume group name, here is the partitioning part of my preseed file: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/F6m84TsY6d/ I have an existing disk in the computer that has a VG on it with the name "vg-[hostname]" and I'm trying to set the name for a new Ubuntu install on a different disk to a different one (sdd). The Ubuntu installer shows an error saying the VG name
[02:08:08] <cuddylier> already exists (when it doesn't - it seems to be trying to use the default of vg-[hostname]). Anyone any idea why this might be?

[02:16:39] <tokam> oerheks: but it does not work either ...

[05:28:25] <johnny> so that shows the default, not just the ones potentially available

[05:29:59] <invisiblek> seems right for focal. gcc 10.1 came out may 2020, focal would have dropped april 2020, with a freeze even before that

[05:31:24] <johnny> so is gcc 10 being skipped in favor of 11 in being the default? and if so, for which release?
[05:31:30] <sarnold> I don't see a gcc 10.0 on this list .. https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html
[05:31:44] <sarnold> but gcc 10.1 wasn't released until a month after 20.04 was released
[05:31:50] <invisiblek> right
[05:32:17] <sarnold> normally we pick a toolchain at the start of a cycle
[05:32:21] <sarnold> not one month after it ends :D
[05:32:38] <invisiblek> !info gcc groovy

[05:33:22] <invisiblek> unsure if it would have been in 20.10, but 21.04 was gcc 10.3 apparently?

[05:33:46] <invisiblek> (i'm done spamming now, just had to know)
[05:33:54] <johnny> ah ok.. so it won't be until 22.04 then
[05:34:06] <johnny> sorry ubuntu peeps, but y'all gonna need gcc11 for my app :(
[05:34:14] <oerheks> one can do this in PM with ubottu too
[05:34:14] <invisiblek> err
[05:34:20] <invisiblek> impish is the current release i think?
[05:34:25] <invisiblek> 21.10?
[05:34:28] <johnny> o
[05:34:32] <oerheks> yes, 6 days old
[05:34:34] <johnny> they switch the defualt fin the same year?
[05:34:40] <johnny> that's unexpected
[05:34:42] <invisiblek> ubuntu has a release in april and october
[05:34:58] <invisiblek> 20.04 is april 2020 release, 21.10 is october 2021, for instance
[05:35:04] <oerheks> !yy.mm
[05:35:05] <ubottu> Ubuntu version numbers are: YY.MM (YY=release year,MM=release month). Each year sees two releases, so just specifying YY is imprecise. See also https://www.ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle
[05:35:06] <johnny> i didn't expect them to switch it in the same yar though
[05:35:13] <johnny> yea i know how ubuntu works release wise
[05:35:17] <oerheks> next 22.04 will be LTS
[05:35:32] <invisiblek> i JUST jumped to 20.04 like 6 months ago...lol
[05:35:48] <johnny> but what i didn't know is when they switch up stuff like default gcc versions
[05:36:07] <johnny> well. thanks everyone. i appreciate your input

I've got an Raspberry Pi running Raspbian 10 connected to a PC running Ub20.04: ping delay is very good (< 1ms) but initialization of ping is slow (it requires few seconds).

[18:19:06] <zph1nx> Hello, ive been working on setting up a hardware in loop system, and as of now im trying to migrate from an old centos based system into a focal install. I do however have problems with our software binding ip adresses to the connected units of the system
[18:20:15] <zph1nx> I suspect part of this is that on the previous system, ip adresses would be assigned to network interfaces even when in a down state, but with netplan no ip comes up when the interface is in a down state, is there a way of modifying this behaviour?

[23:48:46] <bdju> I keep all my stuff up to date (and don't even run ubuntu), so I get where you're coming from. I'm more into arch/void/guix system personally. I was just contacted because this guy doesn't know GNU/Linux well and ran into a problem

[23:50:31] <klausfiend> supporting older distros is a real problem
[23:50:47] <klausfiend> we've got thousands of instances physical and virtual and hundreds still run U14
[23:51:14] <klausfiend> where the rubber meets the road in industry, it's often very difficult to get devs to change out functional components of working systems

[23:53:59] <alkisg> bdju: I had some fully up to date 12.04 systems. Its apt archives got moved to old-archives a month or so ago, so I switched there and I updated, and I got ... 600 MB of updates! I think those were by ESM, which I never got... so ESM does offer a lot of updates :)
[23:54:55] *** Joins: oihan (~oihan@static-176-139-49-174.ftth.abo.bbox.fr)
[23:55:03] <sarnold> yeah after precise esm ended we moved those updates to the old-archives
[23:55:30] <klausfiend> man, it took us a full year to get 12.04 out of our environment a full year AFTER we'd officially deprecated it a full year AFTER Canonical had fully deprecated it.
[23:55:34] <younder> I an all honesty update every 2 to 4 years and avoid the problem
[23:55:37] <alkisg> Thank you sarnold , it causes users to have even more positive feelings for canonical ;)
[23:55:52] <klausfiend> i'm pretty sure we've got a handful of RHEL6 floating around somewhere

[23:55:54] <bdju> will this move to old-archives affect the normal update process? say, if this machine didn't have the updates up to the point of 2019 even
[23:56:19] <younder> Old systems are not safe, they still suffer from the ssh hearbeat problem!
[23:56:20] <sarnold> alkisg: yes, I thought so too :)
[23:56:29] <younder> look it up
[23:56:33] <bdju> heartbleed I think you mean
[23:56:42] <bdju> and ssl not ssh
[23:56:44] <younder> yes, sorry
[23:57:09] <sarnold> alkisg: and as you said, it does help suggest the value of esm -- precise esm was mostly focused on the needs of the customers, newer releases the esm offering is much expanded

[23:57:33] <younder> anyhow a debug problem thath got integrated into the code
[23:57:48] * alkisg keeps three 12.04 VMs for schools that still have Pentium 4's with less than 1 GB RAM, for primary, secondary and high schools... there, "usable" comes first, "security" comes second...
[23:58:43] <younder> Cant't really help people with obsolete computers
