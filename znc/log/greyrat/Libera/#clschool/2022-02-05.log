[02:40:09] <EdLangley[m]> You can use the mop via closer-mop like: (closer-mop:class-direct-slots (find-class 'the-class))
[02:40:42] <EdLangley[m]> But, this might not be what you're asking for: do you want to know the values of the slots in a specific instance or something else?

[02:41:20] <seok> uh, I want to make a class system that interacts with the database
[02:41:52] <seok> I want to write a helper function to convert clos classes to json and reverse
[02:43:04] <seok> is there a documentation for closer-mop
[02:43:35] <EdLangley[m]> It's designed as a compatibility layer for the MOP
[02:43:49] <EdLangley[m]> So, the specification parts of AMOP are its documentation
[02:44:25] <seok> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_the_Metaobject_Protocol this right ?
[02:45:15] <EdLangley[m]> Yeah
[02:45:33] <EdLangley[m]> The specification bits are here: http://metamodular.com/CLOS-MOP/table-of-contents.html
[02:46:09] <seok> should I be purchasing this book or is there somewhere I can read it online ?
[02:46:17] <seok> I'm looking for it at the moment
[02:47:12] <EdLangley[m]> It depends what you need, chapters 5+6 are the specification of the MOP, and those are available at the metamodular link I just sent.
[02:48:47] *** Joins: epony (epony@user/epony)
[02:51:40] <EdLangley[m]> But this is how you'd get the slots in a sort of simple way: https://fwoar.co/pastebin/e68983ac72636717a89e181e340686e00e7b855d.lisp.html
[02:52:00] <EdLangley[m]> It'd probably be a better idea to use readers if they were defined, etc.
[02:52:37] <EdLangley[m]> But, also, I think this is generally a bad idea: it's better for your database to define a serialization protocol and then implement that protocol for each class.
[02:54:28] <seok> hmm
[02:56:01] <seok> Yeah actually the helper function will be used for serialization of each class
[02:56:36] <seok> I'll be copying whole list of slots to json for a number of classes so I thought I'll write it once and reuse it
[02:59:17] <EdLangley[m]> So, rather than serializing slots, do something like take a list of name/function pairs and then serialize the class by calling the functions on it.
[03:01:22] <seok> is there a function to retrieve the accessors for all slots in the class ?
[03:02:43] <EdLangley[m]> Something like this: https://fwoar.co/pastebin/69769ac9f818013887f3dea760dbb764ee81f597.lisp.html
[03:03:35] <EdLangley[m]> Slots are sort of an implementation detail
[03:03:47] *** Quits: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:04:25] <seok> the point of the helper function is that I don't want to reiterate the accessors in the class definitions
[03:04:48] <seok> what if there are 50 classes
[03:05:29] *** Joins: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth)
[03:07:05] <seok> Instead of writing 50 methods to serialize them I just want to write one
[03:07:53] <EdLangley[m]> Well, you can look at chapter 6 of AMOP to see if there’s a helpful function for that
[03:08:23] <EdLangley[m]> In the section on slot definition metaobjects.
[03:09:15] <seok> Yeah thanks I'm reading through it : )
[03:09:46] <seok> I think your first example will do but I'll take a look to see if theres anything better

[16:22:41] <lisp123> I have the following problem
[16:23:27] <lisp123> I want to write a function FIND-CHARACTER-IN-LINE which does what it says, but within it I want to funcall either next-character or previous-character based on what is supplied to the function
[16:23:52] <lisp123> So that FIND-NEXT-CHARACTER-IN-LINE could be written as (FIND-CHARACTER-IN-LINE #'next-character ...)
[16:24:25] <lisp123> Is writing FIND-CHARACTER-IN-LINE as a macro the best way or will an inline function also inline funcalls?
[16:25:34] <lisp123> Also, to complicate matters, FIND-CHARACTER-IN-LINE is a recursive function
[16:25:47] <lisp123> and I recall recursive macros are not straightforward
[16:26:20] <beach> Why do you even contemplate making it a macro?
[16:26:34] <lisp123> To avoid funcalling
[16:26:39] <bremner> As an outsider, I would question such micro-optimization
[16:26:44] <beach> Me too.
[16:26:44] <bremner> benchmark first?
[16:26:46] <Bike> in general, you shouldn't write something as a macro as an attempt increasing performance
[16:27:13] <Bike> if the arguments are to be evaluated normally, it's a function
[16:28:11] <lisp123> Well basically I was writing functions (defun find-next-characteer ...) (defun find-prev-character ...) and then some variants and then decided now is time to consolidate them
[16:29:09] <lisp123> funcall is the easier way, but just wanted to learn :) My latest idea is to do (defmacro find-character-in-line ... `(defun ,find-character-name ...)) where the macro can write the function forms to avoid the issue of recursive macros
[16:31:28] <lisp123> So I guess my question is, will inlining functions inline funcalls? And is this something compilers are smart enough to do?
