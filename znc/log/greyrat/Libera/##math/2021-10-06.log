[01:04:36] <isekaijin> The Krull dimension of its coordinate ring. The transcendence degree of its field of rational functions. If the variety has a smooth point, the dimension of its Zariski cotangent space at that point. Etc.
[01:06:21] <isekaijin> Like, things a priori do not have any good reason to be this nice, but, as if a gift from heavens, they are indeed nice.
[01:06:23] <Franciman> yeah!

[01:31:50] <isekaijin> Then our map of curves is simply the geometric manifestation of a finite extension of fields.
[01:31:54] <Franciman> isekaijin: by blowing up? :D
[01:32:05] <isekaijin> You can use blowups too.
[01:32:28] <Franciman> i don't quite like them because the make my computations hard

[02:45:09] <mornfall> yes you do, but not for representing the numbers
[02:45:13] <isekaijin> Indeed. Peano's axioms are not about sets. Even though, of course, you can construct models of Peano arithmetic in set theory.
[02:45:19] <mornfall> that'd be a model

[02:58:52] <[itchyjunk]> C is algebriacally closed they say

[03:07:13] <[itchyjunk]> mornfall, but i don't see people doing it as much as FTA for w/e reason

[03:07:41] <[itchyjunk]> you always need a little calc to prove FTA?
[03:07:59] <[itchyjunk]> i don't see it crop up as much
[03:08:03] <PlanckWalk> It's not surprising that a result on complex numbers would need some analysis.
[03:08:13] <[itchyjunk]> i've seen FTA in my analysis class, topology class, algebra class, NT class
[03:08:32] <[itchyjunk]> heck, it showed up in a descrete math class. i don't remember the context
[03:08:52] <[itchyjunk]> it is surprising to me. you can talk about field C without analysis

[04:24:47] <isekaijin> Hello. I am about to show how much I know about representation theory, i.e., nothing at all. I am interested in studying the quotient C^n / G, where G is a finite subgroup of GL(n,C).
[04:24:48] <brownorange> I can take an infinite number of steps, but that doesn't mean my stepsize can be infinite..
[04:25:16] <isekaijin> Is the following strategy always viable? Pick generators g1,...,gn of G. Construct X1 = C^n / <g1>, and embed it into some C^(n1) in such a way that the action of G1 = <g2,...,gn> on X is the restriction of a linear representation G1 -> GL(n1,C). Then construct X2 = C^n / <g1,g2> = C^(n1) / <g2>, and embed it into some C^(n2) in such a way that the action of G2 = <g3,...,gn> is the restriction of a
[04:25:18] <isekaijin> linear representation G2 -> GL(n2,C). And so on.

[07:22:13] <brownorange> there are two successor functions right now. one is limited, one is not
[07:23:14] <brownorange> Axiom 5 dictates how the limited successor function works  . It is   ((s(n)=[a] /\ Prov([a])) \/ (s(n) < [a])) -> (s(n) = n+1)
[07:24:40] <brownorange> Basically the limited successor function cannot climb to a value that happens to be a Godel number of a formula with no available proof.
[07:26:14] <brownorange> Therefore formulas encoded by the limited successor function, should always be provable

[07:30:05] <brownorange> Axioms 6 & 7, show how you can convert between the two functions.
[07:31:02] <mornfall> axioms 1-3 don't look like axioms at all (they have no meaning in the theory, since they don't use any symbols in your language)
[07:31:07] <mornfall> 7 is redundant with 4
[07:31:41] <mornfall> and s(n) becomes undefined after some finite sequence of steps
[07:31:47] <mornfall> ignoring the dubious use of n+1
[07:32:14] <brownorange> mornfall, axioms 1 thru 3, are axioms of propositonal logic

[07:34:20] <mornfall> redundant
[07:34:32] <mornfall> 4 is really just syntactic sugar anyway
[07:34:46] <mornfall> + is not part of your theory
[07:35:25] <brownorange> mornfall i'll admit 7 is redundant. could easily derive it from 4

[07:36:37] <brownorange> bos(n) := n+1, is an abbreviation and does not address equality

[09:52:14] <Simplar> I just have three disks one inside another and I would like to denote their areas right
[09:52:54] <somiaj> Don't quite follow, but area of a disk is just pi r^2

[09:53:50] <Simplar> somiaj: my question was how do I *name* the disk?
[09:54:01] <Simplar> By some greek letter? Somehow else? Are there defaults?
[09:54:20] *** Joins: pluri (~pluri@user/pluri)
[09:54:30] <somiaj> So you want to just assign them a variable? Use what you think is appropriate, D_1, D_2, D_3, in toplogy these are often just called balls, so B(x,r) so the ball centered at x of radius r
[09:54:43] <somiaj> there really isn't any standard variable used to label disks
[09:55:00] <somiaj> Circles are considered isomprhic to S^1, but I probably woudln't label the circle (boundary) as S

[11:40:38] <NyB> Hi! I have a possibly silly question: Do the binomial coefficient parameters/operands have names? The operator is not commutative, so is there a common terminology to tell them apart in writing?
[11:41:08] <riv> tbh we just kind of call them n and k
[11:41:13] <riv> or n and r
[11:41:22] <NyB> I have not noticed any particular terminology in Wikipedia, or Wolfram, or in any other place...
[11:41:35] <NyB> yes, n & k seem to be the most common terms
[11:42:17] <NyB> "n-choose k" and so on. I just found it a bit weird that we have a symbol for the operator, but no names for the operands

[16:20:30] <Z-module> An occasionally handy fact: In every R^n, every open set is a countable union of "non-overlapping" n-boxes meaning sets of the form [a_1,b_1] x ... x [a_n,b_n]   and non-overlapping means no two of those boxes have any interior points in common. You can specify that they all be cubes if you like, and that all the corner coordinates (the a_i and the b_i) all come from some specified dense subset of R, such as Q.

[19:06:20] <[itchyjunk]> I guess cauchy riemann equations would be one of those things that don't make sense for formal derivative.
[19:06:37] <[itchyjunk]> interesting that this is called "formal derivative", so the one from the calc might be informal derivative
[19:07:17] <int-e> it's the same "formal" as in "formal power series"
[19:07:28] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: that function defined in the polynomial ring C[x] makes sense and would make sense even if you had no idea whatsoever about derivatives. But of course it originated as the idea of the derivative, a certain limit.
[19:07:36] <int-e> which is to say... it ignores convergence
[19:08:10] <[itchyjunk]> oh..
[19:08:26] <Z-module> you can show quite easily that   lim_{complex h -> 0} ((z + h)^n - z^n)/h = n z^(n-1)  for any complex z, any positive integer n

[19:15:05] <harwiltz> Hi all. I'm getting really confused about something regarding diract delta functions. Suppose you have a probability measure composed of a sum of N diracs at positions p_i (1<=i<=N). The the measure is like P(x) = (1/N)sum_i delta(x - p_i). I'm trying to describe a "derivative" of the density of this measure wrt p_i. It looks to me like the weak derivative should just be 0, but is there any notion

[19:41:05] <isekaijin> (For the likely very few interested ones, the A_n surface is isomorphic to V(xy = z^{n+1}) in C^3, so its field of fractions is simply C(x,z) or C(y,z).

[20:17:35] <anovick> Hey guys, I have a question on Linear Algebra. Say I have a 3x3 matrix M with characteristic polynomial P(t)=(t-2)^3 , is it true to say that the matrix M^2 has the characteristic polynomial P(t)=(t-2^2)^3 = (t-4)^3 ?
[20:17:37] <biberao> int-e: https://imgur.com/a/D9hjc4c
[20:19:49] <anovick> hmm I think in this case there the only eigenvalue M^2 is going to have is 2^2, and M^2 has no other eigenvalues because if there were then they their square root was a eigenvalue of M, whereas M only has 2 as eigenvalue
[20:20:41] <anovick> and since M^2 is order of 3x3 the degree of the polynomial is going to be 3 so there really isn't any other choice for (t-2^2)^i except i=3

[20:43:54] <Guest61> https://i.imgur.com/JTlKb0g.png what does "second order" mean in this context
[20:44:05] <anovick> qergle: so I know that a1, a2, ..., aK are eigenvalues of M, which means that using Jordan form theorem, M is similar to a block matrix D = diag{J(a1),J(a2),...,J(aK)} where each jordan block is of the order of its multiplicity in the characteristic polynomial so k1,k2,...,kN. now this is an upper triangular matrix which means that we know how it behaves when multiplied by itself r times to M^r. we get on the main diagonal a1 ^r
[20:44:05] <anovick> -> k1 times, a2 ^r -> k2 times, ..., aK ^r -> kN times. this is also an upper triangular matrix

Apply binomial, cancle z_0^n. factor out delta_z, cancel it with denominator. Factor out n so I have  lim delta_z -> 0
