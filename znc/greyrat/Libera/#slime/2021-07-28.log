[23:44:51] <makomo> a question regarding indentation. it seems that emacs' default lisp-indent-function isn't capable of indenting flet, cl-flet, cl-labels, etc. nicely (i wonder how the maintainers do it?)
[23:45:26] <makomo> people are suggesting to use common-lisp-indent-function instead, which has much more sophisticated indent specs
[23:46:35] <makomo> common-lisp-indent-function is defined within cl-indent.el, which is part of the emacs tree. and this code actually makes provisions for having different indentations for a single operator, depending on whether it's elisp or cl
[23:47:30] <makomo> but looking at the slime-indentation contrib, it seems like it has a custom patched version/fork of cl-indent and completely redefines its functions, so that they no longer make the above provisions for elisp
[23:48:31] <makomo> does anyone know why this is so? and what's the recommended way to have both elisp and cl (slime) indentation simultaneously?
[23:50:33] <pjb> makomo: because slime uses the inferior lisp to learn how to indent macros.
[23:52:22] <pjb> makomo: with the standard cl-indent, you need to add lisp-indent-function or common-lisp-indent-function properties to each symbol.
[23:52:56] <pjb> makomo: eg https://termbin.com/2xxo
[23:53:50] <pjb> makomo: and notice how cl-indent only knows how to indent differently two groups of subexpressions.  slime indentations is way more sophisticated, eg for macros such as loop that have some syntax inside.
[23:55:52] <makomo> hmmm

[23:56:40] <makomo> pjb: what exactly am i looking at in that text file?
[23:57:00] <makomo> lists of (indent-spec &rest syms)?
[23:59:38] <pjb> makomo: you see the property value for a bunch of symbols.
