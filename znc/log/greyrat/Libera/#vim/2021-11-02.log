[02:29:48] <nickspoon> Add something like this to the top of the file  `unsilent echom 'This is the indent file'`
[02:30:38] <nickspoon> you can do `:verbose set shiftwidth?` to see where the shiftwidth was last set

[02:34:32] <gmcastil> when these files get sourced seems to be a key detail
[02:35:01] <gmcastil> if i understand it right, sourcing it on opening a VHDL file shouldnt change the current buffer
[02:35:02] <nickspoon> Oh. I wasn't suggesting you include `:verbose` in your file

[02:35:31] <gmcastil> the entirety of that line, except the ts set is wrong then

[02:43:49] <gmcastil> should i use set or setlocal to make all of particular filetype have the same indenting?
[02:43:54] <nickspoon> Wait a sec, BufRead should use this format:   autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.vhdl
[02:44:13] <nickspoon> FileType autocmds use the filetype,   autocmd FileType vhdl
[02:44:22] <nickspoon> But other autocmds use the actual file name
[02:44:33] <nickspoon> (or the wildcard match)
[02:44:55] <gmcastil> the filetype autocommands that are in .vim/ftdetect/vhdl.vim are: autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.vhdl set FileType=vhdl
[02:45:05] <nickspoon> Yeah
[02:45:25] <nickspoon> Also, ftdetect scripts are only sourced once, on vim startup, so they always include autocmds
[02:45:35] <gmcastil> then the indent file has autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile vhdl set tabstop=2
[02:45:37] *** Quits: causaui1 (~causasui@192.241.228.169) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[02:45:44] <nickspoon> Whereas indent and ftplugin scripts are sourced when the files are opened, so they _don't_ use autocmds
[02:45:45] <gmcastil> which looks like it should just be the set commands
[02:46:54] <nickspoon> So yes your indent file should just be `setlocal` commands, but the reason re-opening the file still doesn't trigger the autocmds is because they are matching `vhdl` instead of `*.vhdl`
[02:47:18] <gmcastil> that might explain the weird behavior i've seen with other things then - looks like i have these all wrong

[02:57:01] <nickspoon> Yeah if vim doesn't do that itself

[02:57:23] <nickspoon> OK
[02:57:39] <nickspoon> Vim does do `au BufNewFile,BufRead *.vsetf verilog` by itself
[02:57:43] <gmcastil> which isnt surprising, since there isnt a lot of convention on that - some people use .vh and others use .v (and then there's systemverilog which is .svh or sv)

[02:58:34] <nickspoon> yeah I can see in `:e $VIMRUNTIME/filetype.vim` that it matches *.v, *.va, *.vams, *.sv and *.svh
[02:59:03] <gmcastil> yeah, it misses .vh because a lot of people use .vh for VHDL (probably for historical reasons - .vhd and .vhdl are more common now)
[02:59:09] <nickspoon> So keep your ftdetect script, and chuck all your filetype-specific settings in ~/.vim/after/ftplugin
[02:59:31] <gmcastil> so just ftdetect and then the /after/ftplugin/verilog.vim ?
[02:59:38] <nickspoon> yeah

[08:13:17] <b0nn> I'm trying to figure out how to use a plugin https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim - I've installed it according to directions, and can see ~/.vim/plugins/emmet.vim when I :scriptnames, but the `html:5` command is a bit weird, and the <c-y>, command isn't doing anything

[08:17:43] <anchovy> this smells like a bug. I do have :syntax sync fromstart but the brace blocks are not using keepend. it stops at the commented brace and I don't know why the comment doesn't eat it.
[08:17:49] <anchovy> comments are colourised.
[08:18:37] <anchovy> and comment is defined as #.*$ so it should suck in the whole line AFAICT

[09:06:44] <lgc> if that doesn't work, reduce the value of 'ttimeoutlen'

[09:08:15] <b0nn> ok, that works, am just trying to figure out why the line was there in the first place
[09:10:25] <lgc> actually, the issue was probably coming from 'timeoutlen' which was too low (i.e. maybe it took you more than half a second to press "," after "<c-y>")

[14:28:57] <lgc> not sure, but I don't think you can limit a nested match to the start of a region
[14:29:11] <lgc> but maybe you could turn the start of the region in a match, and define it with the "nextgroup" group argument to assert the presence of the rest of the region

[18:24:49] <habamax> well, I hijacked rst filetype, so...
[18:24:57] <nedbat> habamax: sure, as you should.
[18:25:01] <habamax> :so $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/rst.vim
[18:25:36] <habamax> syn clear first
[18:27:50] <nedbat> habamax: ick: the default syntax turns the entire ".. only:" section blue, hi=rstExDirective
[18:28:11] <habamax> yeah, that was the case for reimplementation
[18:28:34] <habamax> issue with comments, and other embedded directives
[18:28:51] *** Joins: lonewulf` (~lonewulf@user/lonewulf)
[18:28:56] <habamax> it just highlights everything embedded as a top level directive
[18:29:10] <habamax> mine is smarter :)
[18:29:18] <nedbat> yes, nice
[18:29:26] <habamax> only .. only:: makes me not happy
[18:29:44] <habamax> but I *think* it is almost impossible to implement in vim syntax right
[18:30:28] <habamax> and it looks like non-standard thing https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html
[18:30:36] <habamax> it is not mentioned ^^

[19:20:43] <bertieb> Silly question, but I can't find the naswer with a quick search- how do I call a function N times, in the way I can prefix a regular editor command with N ?
[19:20:57] *** Quits: saschagrunert (~saschagru@46.128.124.46) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:20:58] <gmcastil> bertieb, i'd imagine a macro is what you're looking for
[19:21:05] <gmcastil> and then just repeat it N times
[19:21:10] <bertieb> (context: I rewrote some 'perma-macros' in vimscript)
[19:21:12] <bertieb> lol
[19:21:20] <bertieb> ah
[19:21:23] <bertieb> welp
[19:21:39] <bertieb> that's what I used to do :D
[19:22:10] <bertieb> maybe I can write a macro to call the function
[19:22:26] <gmcastil> yeah, that's my initial (and quite inexperience) thought
[19:23:05] <romainl> can we have an example?
[19:24:00] *** Quits: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[19:24:35] <bertieb> seems to work okay that way- record macro, call function, stop recording, [NUMBER]@macrokey
[19:25:16] <gmcastil> yep, that seems to be the vim way to repeat things N times
[19:25:28] <bertieb> sure
[19:25:29] <bertieb> I'm (jokingly) slightly reticent to give the example as I'm probably butchering whatever I'm doing :D
[19:25:29] <gmcastil> number, followed by command
[19:25:56] <bertieb> the function jumps via search to a (specified) JSON tag
[19:26:02] <romainl> depending on the use case, a loop might be more appropriate
[19:26:03] <bertieb> and then inserts another key, value pair
[19:26:43] <bertieb> romainl: oh, almost certainly yes; either a loop or funciton which operates on a (vsiual / line) range
[19:27:03] <bertieb> but this is a macro blindly translated to a function :D
[19:27:21] <bertieb> so it's a little janky, given the actual intent
[19:27:35] <romainl> take that as an opportunity to make it smarter/cleaner
[19:27:48] <bertieb> but you know how it is, "I'll get around to rewriting it someday"
[19:27:56] <bertieb> yeah I could and should

[19:37:57] <aruns> I am running VIM - Vi IMproved 8.0 (2016 Sep 12, compiled Jun 06 2019 17:31:41) - this is my .vimrc - https://bpa.st/CHTA - recently I have found that when I insert new lines, the line numbers are not always updating, any new text does not honour my indentation settings, and text from other lines might show up on these new lines. Any ideas as to how to resolve?

[23:12:59] <guru> hi
[23:13:49] <guru> how can i make syntax highlight on for Jenkinsfile?
[23:14:16] <guru> i tried syntax groovy but it returns an error
[23:17:21] <nedbat> habamax: another odd .rst thing that I don't know how to debug: using an = underline, if it's exactly seven ='s long, it's highlighted in red, but it has the same highlight group as when it isn't seven characters.  What can I look for to figure out why?
[23:19:00] <habamax> nedbat: could you open an issue with a screenshot?

[23:21:16] <habamax> probably some edge case that depends on surrounded text?
[23:21:57] <nedbat> habamax: it's the same with the default, so it's probably not the rst syntax alone
[23:22:22] <nedbat> habamax: but i don't even know what to look for.
[23:22:35] <habamax> spelling?
[23:23:19] <habamax> it shouldn't cause spell is turned off for section delimiters
[23:23:48] <habamax> can you share the screen here and name of the highlight group you see?
[23:26:27] <nedbat> habamax: https://imgur.com/a/baQILML the highlight groups are at the bottom
[23:26:47] <nedbat> habamax: lines 48, 51, 54 all have the same highlight groups
[23:27:49] <habamax> I am thinking what could highlight things in vim without using syntax?
[23:27:56] <habamax> text-properties?
[23:28:13] <nedbat> habamax: how do I examine those?
[23:28:27] <habamax> maybe matchadd too
[23:28:31] <nedbat> habamax: the white-on-red is how ErrorMsg looks
[23:29:57] <habamax> could you run :call clearmatches()
