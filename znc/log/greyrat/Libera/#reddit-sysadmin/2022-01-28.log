[01:09:30] <Hunterkll> Universal Print comes with a pool of print jobs that are available to all users who have a license. Each Universal Print license includes 5 print jobs per month which are pooled. For example, a subscription with 1,000 licensed users will have 5,000 jobs per month available to all users. Unused print jobs expire at the end of each month.

[01:09:49] <Hunterkll> not really 
[01:09:50] <Hunterkll> A single printed document is counted as a single print job, regardless of the number of pages or number of copies printed. Attributes such as single vs. double sided or color vs. grayscale do not affect print job count. For example, 15 copies of a 10-page document sent to the printer is counted as a single print job.

[01:17:34] <vinrock> yeah id imagine in the long run for such a large deployment its significant savings over o365
[01:18:15] <Hunterkll> but we went 365 for office suite in our EA with govcloud, so we ended up moving around a large portion of the workload over aynway because... well, we're already paying for it so

[01:19:17] <Hunterkll> govcloud has its own pricing structure
[01:19:22] <vinrock> ah

[03:02:31] <Hunterkll> actually
[03:02:37] <Hunterkll> silicone based thermal pastes are rather common
[03:02:43] <Hunterkll> i use them for heatsinks on power transistors 
[03:02:47] <Hunterkll> got a ton of the shit 
[03:03:04] <Cl0udNinja> yeah even intel cpus come with some
[03:03:12] <Cl0udNinja> or their heatsinks, whatever, same difference
[03:03:17] <Hunterkll> probably the most commonly used type at all
[03:04:14] <Hunterkll> also got a ton of arctice silver ceramique 2 
[03:04:15] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:04:31] <Hunterkll> but i get th is in bulk -> https://www.radioshack.market/collections/thermal-compound/products/caig-laboratories-heat-sink-silicone-grease
[03:05:26] <Kiernian> dumb question because I historically do almost nothing that involves directly handling the hardware...are you supposed to "refresh" thermal paste on a CPU every few years? Because that sounds like BS to me
[03:05:26] <Hunterkll> but yea dell tech just shoots the whole tube onto top of cpu/whatever and bolts down the heatsink in that alternating screw pattern
[03:05:27] <Hunterkll> and that's it 
[03:05:46] <Hunterkll> Kiernian: i mean, it does 'dry out' and become brittle and slightly less effective over time 
[03:06:00] <Hunterkll> if we're looking at a 5+ year old machine i'd definitely do it 
[03:06:04] <Hunterkll> 2-3 year old i wouldn't bother
[03:06:06] <Kiernian> hrm. interesting
[03:06:09] <Kiernian> thanks
[03:06:31] <Hunterkll> kinda the4 effect you hvae when taking apart a really old ass computer and it's like it's kinda cemented to the heatsink?
[03:06:40] <Hunterkll> or like, ever try and remove a heatsink and rip the CPU out with it?
[03:06:44] <Hunterkll> signs it probably should be redone :P
[03:08:09] <Hunterkll> Kiernian: on that note, thermal paste itself generally has an optimal shelf life
[03:09:00] <Hunterkll> https://www.cputemper.com/does-cpu-thermal-paste-expire/
[03:09:33] <Kiernian> huh. In going on 25 years of IT, I think I've pulled or installed three? CPUs...*maybe* five...
[03:09:53] <Hunterkll> definitely have done far, far more than that..... at home ;P
[03:10:28] <Kiernian> oh wait, no, probably a few dozen if you count some extremely cavalier "troubleshooting" during the optiplex gx270 BS in 2004.
[03:10:54] <Kiernian> there's a chip BUBBLING on the motherboard, but sure, I'll reseat the CPU you phone support ninny...
[03:11:25] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:11:34] <Hunterkll> i've done a few CPU swaps back and forth with dell support before on R710's 
[03:11:42] <Hunterkll> with a few ram swaps bvefore that
[03:12:02] <Hunterkll> they REALLY didn't want to replace the CPU at the time because it had been out of production for a while and they have limited stocks, haha, but we were able to prove the memory controller on the CPU was defunct 
[03:12:24] <Hunterkll> slot A3 failed occasionaly random..... after anywhere from a week to a month or two.... moved it over.... now slot B3 randomly failing.... there's your sign
[03:12:26] <Kiernian> ha! wow. that's...impressive
[03:12:52] <Hunterkll> that's the first failed/failing memory controller i've ever seen in a CPU
[03:12:56] <Hunterkll> 2nd was my original 7980XE 
[03:13:05] <Kiernian> yeah...I..wait, a second one? LOL

[03:15:28] <Hunterkll> actually no, was a 4-core ... i5-7640X
[03:15:40] <Hunterkll> returned that after testing, ended up with an i7-7800X for my spare X299 system 
[03:15:59] <Hunterkll> but that i5-7640X was hilarious, cost less than half the price of my motherboard

[06:59:46] <sideup66> well, windows didnt auto detect it :(
[07:00:04] <sideup66> closest autom atch is "microsoft PCL6 class driver"
[07:00:06] <sideup66> wut
[07:02:33] <xe0n> its a network printer....install the driver, map a port, good to go
[07:02:47] <enix>  not that simple
[07:02:49] <enix> first you have to roll an ad
[07:02:53] <enix> then setup the drivers on the network
[07:02:57] <enix> then link it with m365
[07:03:00] <enix> then buy DrGibby a beer
[07:03:02] <xe0n> then install papercut
[07:03:04] <xe0n> then buy some paper
[07:03:06] <xe0n> and toner
[07:03:07] <enix> then get lazy and never complete it
[07:03:08] <xe0n> then throw it out the window
[07:03:31] <sideup66> old laserjet 4000n
[07:03:35] <enix> papercut is trash?
[07:03:44] <sideup66> Hunterkll: should i go with that standard pcl thing hp offers
[07:03:58] <sideup66> or actually grab a driver for this thing..i dont want 50Ibs of HP bloat.
[07:04:26] <enix> ^ genuinely asking
[07:04:48] <xe0n> papercut is good
[07:05:12] <Hunterkll> sideup66: well
[07:05:13] <Hunterkll> neither
[07:05:17] <enix> ah sweet
[07:05:27] <sideup66> k....what driver
[07:05:29] <Hunterkll> sideup66: use the printer specific driver from check windows update button first
[07:05:38] <Hunterkll> then, if you run into any issues, use that universal PCL 5 driver version i said above
[07:05:48] <sideup66> ahhh ok
[07:05:57] <sideup66> yeah im trying to see if i can get windows to find it first
[07:06:10] <Hunterkll> so add printer, click "chose driver", then "check windows update" then go to the HP entries and find the printer model
[07:06:15] <Hunterkll> most of these older drivers are ripped out 
[07:06:19] <Hunterkll> but stillin the WU catalog
[07:06:26] <Hunterkll> that button d ownloads the WU catalog for printer drivers 
[07:06:28] <Hunterkll> so you see all of them
[07:06:37] <Hunterkll> that's how I install the LJ4 driver (even on Win11 machines)
[07:06:46] <Hunterkll> i'm lucky they  made a 64-bit update for that driver for Vista lol
[07:06:58] <Hunterkll> for mine that is
[07:07:04] <Hunterkll> on the latest W11 insider build and still works just fine
[07:07:29] <Hunterkll> i've had an LJ4 of some variety since I was like 8, lol
[07:07:51] <Hunterkll> fuckin cheap state surplus warehouse ones first, i think this one i got at a hamfest 10 years ago... $5 toner carts that last a few years... lol
[07:07:52] <sideup66> lol ok, well i pushed the button
[07:07:55] <Hunterkll> never paid more than $20 or so
[07:07:56] <sideup66> taking its sweet ass time though
[07:07:59] <Hunterkll> well
[07:08:17] <sideup66> and im not on a slouch of a pc
[07:08:19] <Hunterkll> it's downloading a catalog and parsing every single driver entry to display that'd be compatible with your system
[07:08:22] <sideup66> fair
[07:08:30] <Hunterkll> which basically means all drivers, XP64 and up, that have ever been in WU 
[07:08:38] <sideup66> oh....lovely lol
[07:08:40] <Hunterkll> well, might be only vista and up for these platforms 
[07:08:43] <Hunterkll> oh yes
[07:08:52] <Hunterkll> you will see brands in there you'd never remotely associate with printers even 10 years ago
[07:08:53] <Hunterkll> :p
[07:09:05] <sideup66> lol, this should be kinky
[07:09:07] <Hunterkll> chances are you'll get a Vista, or maybe 7 driver 
[07:09:23] <sideup66> yeah, im expecting vista
[07:09:30] <sideup66> probably around the time people finally gave up on this printer
[07:09:42] <xe0n> yeah it's prehistoric lol
[07:09:43] <Hunterkll> and that vista driver will be a mod/repack from microsoft

[07:12:46] <Hunterkll> "Microsoft driver update for HP Laserjet 4000 series" has an awful lot of results
[07:12:56] <Hunterkll> note that there's like, different ways of laserjet driver naming
[07:12:59] <Hunterkll> so you may have to look around 
[07:13:34] <Hunterkll> and you seem to have options for PCL 5, 6, and PS (postscript)

[07:49:26] <Hunterkll> starting to wonder offhand if some other package i installed added more than what this list is pulling, or if yoursis ordered differently (for the same reason) but oh well
[07:49:27] <sideup66> yep, it was listed in that one
[07:49:34] <sideup66> 4000 series pcl 6
[07:49:37] <sideup66> weird that its 6 though
[07:49:44] <Hunterkll> well, you have 3 choices
[07:49:47] <Hunterkll> i gave you the PCL 6 version 
[07:49:50] <Hunterkll> PCL 5, PCL 6, and PS 
[07:50:00] <sideup66> whats the difference between 5 and 6?
[07:50:05] <Hunterkll> newer standard

[07:50:32] <Hunterkll> heh
[07:50:40] <Hunterkll> sideup66: HP LaserJet 4000 series introduced the new PCL 6 standard
[07:50:41] <Hunterkll> :P
[07:50:45] <sd> 12<c‚Äãooleb09> I wouldn't mind getting some indicative per user values to base ourselves on
[07:50:59] <Hunterkll> in 1995 
[07:51:37] <sideup66> nevermind its pcl 5
[07:51:39] <sideup66> lol
[07:51:43] <sideup66> thought it was 6
[07:51:45] <sideup66> nvm
[07:52:48] <Hunterkll> hm?
[07:52:57] <Hunterkll> you have 5, 6, and PS drivers, I gave you the 6 driver
[07:52:58] <Hunterkll> lol
[07:53:50] <Hunterkll> your printer supports all 3 standards/languages
[07:54:16] <sideup66> i thought i selected pcl6 then it showed pcl 5 on the test page lol
[07:54:20] <yuken> Alright, I need to make me a DIY mill.
[07:54:24] <sideup66> doesnt matter
[07:54:26] <sideup66> long as it works
[07:54:27] <Hunterkll> printer-side menu configuration 
[07:54:41] <Hunterkll> so driver's probably talking PCL 6 Standard, which is just PCL 5e
[07:54:56] <Hunterkll> if printer-side is configured for 5 
[07:55:05] <Hunterkll> either way, good enough
[07:55:43] <sideup66> linux was literally 2 mouseclicks lol
[07:55:56] <Hunterkll> depends on distro
[07:55:58] <sideup66> boot > menu > printers > add > network > hp thing
[07:56:00] <Hunterkll> took me a week to get mine working :P
[07:56:06] <sideup66> oh want hplip or use jetdirect lol
[07:56:14] <sideup66> i just said jetdirect, doesnt need hplip
[07:56:16] <Hunterkll> had to recompile cups for some reason i remember
[07:56:20] <sideup66> super basic dumb printer
[07:56:59] <Hunterkll> what i do is just save the cab file and keep it on a network share
[07:57:06] <Hunterkll> have a basic repo for all hardware i have
[07:57:14] <Hunterkll> firmware, drivers, OS specific quirks, config files, etc
[07:57:44] <Hunterkll> and hplip is 'hp laserjet internet publishing'
[07:58:07] <Hunterkll> oh wait, th ere's a newer thing that's actually something different
[07:58:08] <Hunterkll> lol
[07:58:15] <Hunterkll> the driver package
[07:58:45] <sideup66> typically ill do the same
[07:58:49] <sideup66> save drivers
[07:58:58] <sideup66> so i dont need to go on the scavenger hunt later
[07:59:14] <Hunterkll> fortunately with the WU catalog it's not so bad if it's a driver that is/ever was in WU 
[07:59:23] <Hunterkll> they host content there from 2000 on up 
[07:59:36] <Hunterkll> windows 2000 that is, so drivers often have 1998/1999 dates
[07:59:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[07:59:41] <Hunterkll> if they were win2k compat
[07:59:43] *** Quits: DSee (~DSee@173.237.207.61) (Quit: Quit)
[08:00:55] <sideup66> meh i back them up
[08:00:59] <sideup66> less work and i can be lazy
[08:01:12] <sideup66> and something this old doesnt need much in the way of driver honestly
[08:01:14] <sideup66> super basic and dumb
[08:01:21] <Hunterkll> you'd be surprised
[08:01:34] <Hunterkll> but these drivers are more of a translation layer than anything else
[08:01:43] <Hunterkll> basically just teaching the print spooler how to spit out the rendered data to the printer
[08:01:59] <Hunterkll> could potentially use any PCL 6 driver in theory as long as you didn't engage features the printer doesn't have
[08:02:24] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:02:27] <Hunterkll> so the CPU in that printer
[08:02:34] <Hunterkll> was originally designed for low-cost windows NT RISC workstations
[08:02:49] <Hunterkll> it's a 100MHz MIPS processor 
[08:03:16] <Hunterkll> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R4200 (it's the 4300 variant)
[08:03:25] <Hunterkll> it's also the N64 CPU 
[08:04:34] <Hunterkll> 64 bit cpus from the early 90s, woohoo
[08:06:05] <sideup66> lol
[08:08:46] <sideup66> weeee thats done
[08:09:00] <sideup66> now to figure out how to put it with my shit....room is gonna be interesting lol

[14:55:11] <Kiernian|Work> unless you count, like, just the manufacturing floor or whatever.
[14:56:15] <signofzeta> then you go down, so plan for redundancy
[14:57:29] <Kiernian|Work> exactly
[14:57:36] <signofzeta> get a Raspberry Pi or HPE Microserver and turn it into a (RO)DC, problem solved.  also, avoid running DHCP on a server unless you can make it redundant; stick it on your firewall instead.
[14:57:50] <signofzeta> can you afford two WAN connections? sweet, do that
[14:58:15] <Kiernian|Work> more like can you afford to NOT have two WAN connections? okay then, save money and shut down sometimes.
[14:58:39] <signofzeta> If you're in the Ubiquiti UniFi camp, there's that U-LTE thing that can act as a backup WAN connection. i haven't tried it.
[14:59:45] <Kiernian|Work> I am, but I haven't tried it on their gear. I did it with Watchguard years ago, though. It was...not great a decade ago. It's probably a lot better now given that people use stuff like cradlepoints, peplinks, sierra wireless, etc gear
[14:59:46] <signofzeta> or heck, migrate fully to Azure AD.  with OneDrive/SharePoint able to cache files locally, you're surprisingly less down than if you lose your file server and DC.
[15:00:13] <sd> 02<M‚Äãitchy93> Okta
[15:00:15] <Kiernian|Work> that's what we did. migrated fully to aad. monr0e was decrying it on the grounds of connection loss

[15:00:45] <sd> 02<M‚Äãitchy93> Teams is also useless
[15:00:53] <sd> 02<M‚Äãitchy93> Same with OneDrive
[15:01:13] <signofzeta> OneDrive at least caches some files locally, so you might still have your recent things.
[15:01:33] <monr0e> What I mean is, what happens if you lose connectivity and someone does the boosh and forgets their password? You can't get them up and running, and you get the flack for it. Hell, if there's a DNS issue that impacts routing to Azure but doesn't impact the rest of the internet, that user is still unable to work. Its all these little problems that make cloud administrative solutions a stupid idea in my book. 
[15:02:00] <signofzeta> You're not wrong, monr0e. each solution has its pros and cons.
[15:02:49] <signofzeta> At least with AAD you just have to ask "Is the Internet down?"  On the other hand, "Is the Internet down? Is the VPN tunnel down? Is the Internet down at the other location? Is the file server rebooting for updates? Did it get a bad update? Is the user over quota?" etc.
[15:02:54] <monr0e> "Hey, can you lock this user out, they're WFH but they're getting fired for leaking our IP" "Sorry, no can do, we can't administrate for the moment"
[15:03:16] <signofzeta> well, there is the Azure AD mobile app for quickies like that
[15:03:40] <signofzeta> I've done it when I've decided to leave early on a Friday and an email comes in during my second beer
[15:03:52] <signofzeta> having the same email signature on my phone as my Outlook definitely helped
[15:04:32] <monr0e> Doesn't help if the problem is at Azure's side
[15:05:05] <monr0e> And in that case, you don't have much of an out. You just have to sit and wait and hope the DC monkeys they employ are capable enough to fix it
[15:05:13] <signofzeta> true, which is rare but it has happened

[17:02:43] <mjt> _flood: have you seen this article? https://blog.sqlauthority.com/2018/06/03/sql-server-sql-server-agent-not-starting-failed-to-initialize-sql-agent-log-reason-access-is-denied/
[17:02:49] <signofzeta> but if this is mission-critical, you could set up STunnel and have it wrap connections to [::]:465 to localhost:25.  you'd be crazy to use this in production if you use email to make money, but if you have no other option...
[17:02:55] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> Anyone have some metric suggestions for monitoring the productivity of a helpdesk, outside of 'tickets closed'
[17:03:05] <mjt> perhaps run the startup command he suggests and see if you get the same error output
[17:03:15] <interop_madness> mjt, so do you have a reverse proxy in place that does the SMTPS thing? now that Exchange not supporting SMTPS stands in the room...
[17:03:19] <mjt> don't tinker with the registry unless you're sure that's the issue hough
[17:04:09] <mjt> interop_madness: Sorry, let me clarify. That was *not* a connection to an Exchange server.
[17:04:14] * mjt can't afford Microsoft Exchange
[17:04:18] <interop_madness> ah ok
[17:04:23] <interop_madness> the plot thickens
[17:04:30] <mjt> You could try connecting to Office 365 though
[17:04:54] <mjt> see if the ms exchange servers respond ;) 
[17:04:55] <Kiernian> onenerdyguy -- depends on your reporting capabilities. Can/do you link repeat incidents together for the same endpoint with the same issue? Because permafix v. band-aid tracking is good if it's possible.
[17:05:01] <_flood> mjt: i did but am not getting access denied error referenced, i am going to try to set the sqlagent log file to a different location now so i can see if it spits out more info, will report back shortly, thank you
[17:05:18] <signofzeta> sorry, we have two discussions:  one about Exchange and SMTPS, the other about a SQL Server instance failing to start.
[17:05:23] <interop_madness> No, it needs to be onprem Exchange, this is part of some necessary tests before a release - the test is now in question, obviously
[17:05:29] <mjt> signofzeta: my fault ... 
[17:05:58] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> @Kiernian I'm developing the reporting capabilities to tie back to the required metrics. Going for more of a 'what results do I want' and working backwards
[17:06:30] <mjt> interop_madness: yeah sorry our onprem exchange server got decomm'd years ago in favour of Office 365
[17:06:40] <mjt> interop_madness: So can't help you there : ( 
[17:07:00] <DrGibby> wait, you removed the exchange server?
[17:07:22] <DrGibby> you know you have to keep it if you deployed on-prem to begin with, right?
[17:07:27] <interop_madness> no problem, as it seems, the test just excpects things that are not possible anyway (other connections e.g. STARTTLS work)
[17:07:45] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> yeah, MS needs it as the tie back
[17:07:48] <mjt> i don't manage my organisation's mail infra, but I do recall something abou needing to keep a local server going 
[17:07:48] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> for 'reasons'
[17:08:06] <DrGibby> AD attributes that are not in o365
[17:08:11] <DrGibby> iirc
[17:09:07] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> yeah, i remember that being hte case, but you'd think they could fix that by now
[17:09:18] <DrGibby> think its easier said than done
[17:09:21] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> even more so since you can obv go full 0365 which is just them managing exchange, so they could make it work
[17:09:24] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> but I'm not MS
[17:09:39] <DrGibby> I'm sure if it was easy they would have fixed it by now
[17:09:41] <mjt> i dont know if it's possible to establish a smtp connection to the vestigial on-prem box 
[17:09:53] <mjt> i thought it had to go through EOP 
[17:10:47] <arlion> mistiry: I built bots last night and omg it is the best thing in this game
[17:11:17] <arlion> mistiry: really sucks that i have to wait till blue boxes to make them useful in building shit tho
[17:11:26] <Kiernian> onenerdyguy -- okay, so repeat touches is a good metric on multiple counts. it can catch poor first "x" resolution handling AND recurring issues that need more focus/examination. ticket TYPE counts is good, too. Figuring out WHERE the work is coming from. Checking for ping-pong ticket flips is a good metric. stops a lot of "waiting on client"/"waiting on technician"/"waiting on client" stuff that's super prevalant when KPIs are strictly enforced. 
[17:11:27] <Kiernian> Also really helps with vendors :S 
[17:12:42] <Kiernian> if you can, whether or not you're tracking "customer" satisfaction, try to rate technician satisfaction
[17:13:17] <Kiernian> if your helpdesk people are regularly marking the same stuff as "makes me super unhappy" it's a huge avenue for potential improvement in process
[17:13:18] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> customer satisfaction is a metric we've added, to mixed result. Tech satisfaction is one we track though, and it's been huge for us.
[17:13:26] <Kiernian> cool :D
[17:13:47] <Kiernian> do you track number of technicians per ticket?
[17:14:02] <Kiernian> whether in cost per ticket or number of times a ticket gets re-assigned?
[17:14:21] <Kiernian> playing "how many technicians does it take" gets old :P

[17:27:37] <PattyCakes> "My business has process failurs that you can't control, therefore, you're fired"
[17:28:35] <Kiernian> eh, it came out that he knew they were overpaying him by a fair amount and he chose not to say anything about it (admitted it to them, I think) in the hopes that they'd just let him keep it. They almost terminated him because if he'll keep quiet or cover up about that, what else could he be a liability about, business-wise
[17:28:39] <PattyCakes> what pisses me off though is that when THEY fuck up, the world stops and they want their money back TODAY

[17:38:35] <JollyRgrs> I know this b/c I used to have to call a stupid number to verify checks would clear before I accepted them... for those idiots that refused to pay with card
[17:38:46] <PattyCakes> thats a bank thing, not a governance thing
[17:39:12] <JollyRgrs> well, i suppose if you put the check through it will... but a lot of places now will pre-check the check before trying to process it
[17:39:42] <JollyRgrs> but yeah, if you write a check and someone tries to deposit it... it'll attempt to clear funds or no funds

[17:40:24] <PattyCakes> and if you decline overdraft protection from your establishment/institution, it will not STOP the check from trying to clear
[17:40:37] <PattyCakes> overdraft protection will either move funds from a valid account you hae to cover the check
[17:40:39] <PattyCakes> or you get an NSF
[17:41:07] <PattyCakes> with a debit card, if you try and pay for something and don't have money AND protection is disabled -> card declined and there's no NSF
[17:42:13] <PattyCakes> pay for something with no money on a card, and protection is anabled -> Charge clears and either your bank wil move funds from another account you have, or you get hit with an NSF
[17:42:50] <PattyCakes> You have to opt in for card protection, and for check protection (moving funds to cover an overdraft). If you don't opt in, then don't write checks when there's no money in the account :P
[17:43:34] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> Patty my bank separates overdraft protection and coverage. Protection just moves funds and coverage front you the money and charge a huge fee.

[17:44:37] <PattyCakes> (unless you issue a manual stop payment)

[19:04:40] <JollyRgrs> man, WTF HOME DEPOT! I had to order some nuts and home depot had the best deal at the right quantity i wanted... the bolts i ordered came in last week... the nuts are still in LEEDS, AL for the last week
[19:04:41] <PublicWifi> dammit jolly, you get me all worked up to finally do some homeassistant stuff everytime we talk lol

[19:05:36] <mistiry> arlion: usually i use the fluid trains for the crude, and bring that close to the main base and offload to processing
[19:05:46] <mistiry> dont really use trains for the other fluids tho
[19:05:50] <PublicWifi> I've been also looking at a -safe- way to measure my home power usage from inside. You can setup a current transformer and feed that into an esp or something (with filters and stuff) but those can be dangerous
[19:05:57] <PublicWifi> especially if its left floating on accident
[19:06:08] <mistiry> i'll pipe those wherever, or pipe it into a factory to barrel it up, and have the bots move the full barrels where needed
[19:06:25] <JollyRgrs> my wife wanted to get these sylvania smart bulbs... but they don't have a way to connect to HA, only to google... and that and their app sucks... so I got these 15W Athom RGBCCT bulbs from aliexpress and i've been really happy with it. you can run tasmota or WLED on them
[19:06:29] <arlion> ooooooooo... yeah, haven't played with barrels yet.
[19:06:35] <mistiry> like for sulfuric acid, i'll barrel that up and have bots taking full barrels over to uranium mining, and then bots to bring the empty barrels back over for refilling
[19:06:51] <JollyRgrs> PublicWifi: there's enough existing products, i'd prob just fork over the extra $ and get one of those
[19:06:55] <PublicWifi> do you worry about firmware upgrades on your devices JollyRgrs ? Kinda makes me nevous having lots of IoT spitting out wifi data when they could be vulnerable
[19:07:04] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> Do you guys have any color conventions for patch cables or just say 'screw it' and everything's the same?
[19:07:07] <JollyRgrs> PublicWifi: yes and no
[19:07:18] <JollyRgrs> 1) i don't think anyone in my area would be "hacking" IoT things
[19:07:19] <arlion> mistiry: interesting.
[19:07:22] <PublicWifi> @Killnine I usually split data and voice by color minimum

[19:07:37] <int0x1C8> we talking about factorio or something?
[19:07:38] <PublicWifi> most of the time I like to keep major differences a diff color
[19:07:56] <JollyRgrs> mistiry: or not... I like talking to my friends
[19:08:00] <PublicWifi> JollyRgrs: yeah worst case they just flick your lights or see that your house isn't very humid i guess lol
[19:08:07] <JollyRgrs> when y'all go full factorio, I lose you for a few weeks :P
[19:08:09] <mistiry> Hunterkll usually does the power for us, but he drops these ridiculous massive blueprints that generate dozens of GW we never use LOL

[19:09:30] <JollyRgrs> PublicWifi: i'd like to automate the garage door... at least having a sensor to tell me if it is closed or not
[19:09:37] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> Yeah, I don't think we even need that because we're almost onto Teams voice. So its kinda all data now. But I was maybe thinking of trunk lines or APs or something

[19:09:58] <PublicWifi> JollyRgrs: yeah I've been reading about that. I feel like I'd need a multi-point sensor group to tell if its REALLY closed lol
[19:10:02] <int0x1C8> JollyRgrs, we have IoT garage openers in 2 of our warehouses
[19:10:06] <mistiry> arlion: multiplayer is so good on that game. its exactly the same game, but with friends so things go much faster

[19:10:10] <JollyRgrs> my front door is a schlage encode (wifi) and it only LOCKS with google... using amazon key or whatever, you can use it to unlock, but i don't do amazon's ecosystem
[19:10:24] <PublicWifi> yeah noty
[19:10:25] <Telgareith> JollyRgrs: Dad is working on that. There's a device that triggers the up and down switch and you wire a reed switch to the bottom of the garage door to make sure it's fully closed.
[19:10:32] <PublicWifi> not gonna have any possibility of someone opening my door remotely lol
[19:10:47] <JollyRgrs> about to put one of those on the back door too... not cheap, but it sovles a problem
[19:11:09] <Telgareith> just buy old security system reed switches
[19:11:12] <PublicWifi> yeah Telgareith i thought about doing the same but at the top since the bar thing goes right about my opener motor, so it would be easy to tell if the garage is open with a reed switch up there
[19:11:14] <JollyRgrs> Telgareith: yeah... you can use lots of different methods... basically same as security sensors for window/door being open/closed
[19:11:28] <int0x1C8> in our case it's mainly so we don't have to give building keys to all the snow people, they just use the app to open the garage to where all the snow equipment is
[19:11:35] <Telgareith> PublicWifi: the point is to know if it's *fully* closed
[19:11:51] <PublicWifi> yeah that's why I would end up having to do a multi sensor solution lol
[19:11:54] <PublicWifi> cause I dont trust shit
[19:12:01] <JollyRgrs> your door unlevel?
[19:12:04] <PublicWifi> a reed switch on the ground is sad
[19:12:15] <PublicWifi> dust, foot traffic, etc will get in there
[19:12:18] <Telgareith> you already have the beam system on the ground
[19:12:21] <JollyRgrs> put a sensor at the top of the door and the other part of the sensor on the wall just next to it
[19:12:26] <Telgareith> reed switches are sealed glass vials

[19:15:27] <PublicWifi> bam
[19:15:28] <JollyRgrs> most ppl just use tilt and see if the thing is vertical... if not, not closed

[19:17:18] <PublicWifi> JollyRgrs: cause I'm being hyperbolic :D
[19:17:20] <Disconnect> Instead of unhooking it, better to leave it hooked and de-power the opener. Much higher resistance.
[19:17:23] <PublicWifi> prolly 2 honestly
[19:17:25] <JollyRgrs> if the last (top) segment of your door is straight vertical, isn't that enough to know it is closed?
[19:17:33] <PublicWifi> is it?
[19:17:36] <Telgareith> garage doors have a pin in them
[19:17:38] <JollyRgrs> has your garage door ever gone cock-eyed?
[19:17:39] <Telgareith> or should
[19:17:42] <PublicWifi> nope
[19:17:54] <PublicWifi> I love this conversion so much lol
[19:17:56] <Telgareith> ours does and we can pin it shot
[19:18:02] <Telgareith> *shut
[19:18:10] <Disconnect> If the top panel is not straight its definitely not closed. Cock-eyed is an inch gap on one side or the other
[19:18:21] <JollyRgrs> yeah, mine has a huge handle in the middle that you twist to lock it in
[19:18:22] <fritzwastaken> s/conversation/big peepee thats in my mouth

[19:18:42] <PublicWifi> i wonder how garage door openers work. like the button on the wall
[19:18:43] <Disconnect> (All of this assumes you either use the pin-lock "deadbolt" or don't have one)
[19:18:48] <fritzwastaken> lol PublicWifi cant even spell conversation
[19:18:51] <fritzwastaken> conversion
[19:18:58] <PublicWifi> do they send an analog signal to the motor to turn
[19:19:02] <PublicWifi> or is it a digital pulse
[19:19:03] <Telgareith> that's a better design JollyRgrs 
[19:19:10] <int0x1C8> PublicWifi, either they're electrically connected to the motor unit, or they send a radio signal
[19:19:14] <Disconnect> Super easy to find out, its just a simple momentary switch
[19:19:18] <PublicWifi> mines def electrically connected
[19:19:19] <JollyRgrs> in fact, I have to eventually clean out a space in my garage... the motor is on a really flimsy bracket and that causes the door to think it bumped something during the initial jolt of opening... and it'll fault and stop closing
[19:19:32] <Telgareith> the motor is an AC motor with microswitches attached to stops on either end
[19:19:36] <Telgareith> actually
[19:19:39] <Telgareith> they're timers
[19:19:42] <PublicWifi> it would be neat to be able to tap into that control signal so you could also keep tabs on the amount of open and close commands it gets
[19:19:50] <Telgareith> the motor just stalls for a little while at each end
[19:19:58] <int0x1C8> PublicWifi, you can do that
[19:19:58] <Disconnect> and a current limiter I would expect, to handle the 'force' adjustments
[19:20:01] <PublicWifi> so if your sensors say closed, and your count agrees, its safe to say
[19:20:19] <int0x1C8> remote garage openers are radios, and there's actually only a few standard signal forms
[19:20:22] <PublicWifi> I'm gonna have to probe my opener this week and see what kind of signal it receives from the button panel lol
[19:20:30] <PublicWifi> yes but the remote opener talks to the main unit
[19:20:42] <PublicWifi> the mai unit is still the one ulltimately telling the garbage motor to turn on
[19:20:45] <Disconnect> much easier to look it up online
[19:20:50] <int0x1C8> so people do the equivalent of wardriving but for garage openers
[19:20:53] <Disconnect> then probe it to make it cooler (homegrown automation perhaps?)
[19:21:10] <int0x1C8> just continuously sending out the known open signals and see which garage doors open
[19:21:21] <PublicWifi> I haven't tinkered with my electronics in a year, its time to get the soldering iron back out lol

[19:21:52] <JollyRgrs> the door button is just thin wire to run the control signal to the main board. and yeah, they are pretty dumb/simple setups

[19:22:12] <PublicWifi> and the actual unit inside the motor housing handles the signals
[19:22:13] <int0x1C8> at least thats how it used to be, I'd imagine its changed
[19:22:14] <Disconnect> That is cuz people never change them. Most of them have vulns (sigh) but the past decade or more has done basic pairing modes triggered by physical access. So you can try to auto-open the old ones by brute force, but newer ones are more resiliant to wardriving
[19:22:41] <Disconnect> er, re wardriving 
[19:23:29] <AnonymooseReddtr> well yea
[19:23:30] <JollyRgrs> tbh, i think the idea to put the garage door in HA and then remove the RF feature (have it all hardwired) would be a better deal for security
[19:23:35] <AnonymooseReddtr> garage doors now have a rolling code
[19:23:47] <int0x1C8> put that bitch in a faraday cage
[19:23:48] <JollyRgrs> but sometimes you just want that push button on the remote vs a phone app
[19:24:02] <PublicWifi> its just.... once you network a home entrance...
[19:24:12] <PublicWifi> it makes your home net security really matter
[19:24:16] <AnonymooseReddtr> @ my inlaws years ago we setup a door opener and didn't have the switch.

[19:44:16] <mistiry> they didnt want to pay the contractor to connect patch panel to switch. so they got pink patch cables. yeah, im a bit spiteful.
[19:45:07] <misspwn> originally from MN and transplanted here, our weather is nuts. we'll have 70 degrees and a tornado in december to freezing temps back to normal temps

[19:45:59] <vinrock> its not usualy wild here with the snow but we've had some huge storms
[19:46:13] <misspwn> no but when you folks get that dump, you really get it and it's nuts!

[20:00:15] <PublicWifi> better put the key back to default after you install the shit
[20:00:20] <int0x1C8> I removed it after I installed the printer
[20:00:25] <PublicWifi> its a fuckin pain for sure
[20:00:32] <PublicWifi> and MS said they aint doing anything else with it
[20:00:37] <PublicWifi> auto printer installs be damned

[20:01:06] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> What's the tldr?
[20:01:08] <PublicWifi> unless you use v4 print drivers which must suck
[20:01:08] <int0x1C8> they use it to print tag labels for our plant nursery, they have to be weatherproof
[20:01:23] <PublicWifi> tldr attackers could use the print spooler service to pwn window machines
[20:01:28] <PublicWifi> since the spooler runs as SYSTEM
[20:01:48] <PublicWifi> so in order to install print drivers now you have to go through a UAC prompt no matter what (unless you bypass like int0x1C8 did)
[20:02:11] <int0x1C8> so MS said "no more installing printers for you" and now we have to do some hacky bullshit to install network printers
[20:02:15] <PublicWifi> basically means no one can install a pwnd print driver on your machine and take advantage of the vulnerblity 
[20:02:45] <PublicWifi> but it also means your GPO that pushed out printers no longer works
[20:02:58] <PublicWifi> pushed out printers to users*
[20:03:18] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> we've now started including drivers in our task sequence for deploy
[20:03:20] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> So even if you have a print server that 'manages' drivers, those drivers can't be installed by GPO?
[20:03:28] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> nope.
[20:03:31] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> Huh...
[20:03:32] <PublicWifi> @onenerdyguy yeah that's a good idea
[20:03:39] <PublicWifi> it can but you have to enable the bypass
[20:03:45] <PublicWifi> which means you're still vulnerable
[20:03:50] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> we also are pushing new drivers using pnputil and such as we get new printers out via SCCM just in case
[20:04:10] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> don't like it, cuz now every client basically has every driver for every printer in our fleet, whether they need it or not

[20:17:31] <_flood> any help is most appreciated as i have tried everything i can think of and procmon is not yielding any good leads, 2016 sql agent service no longer starts as a domain user account, it was working but i cannot figure out what broke it, i make it a local admin of the server, sql agent starts, if i remove it doesn't start and doesn't even write anything to the sql log file, i have checked permissions on directories/etc. it 
[20:17:31] <_flood> has them both explicity set by me and by the default sql groups, can anyone help point me in the right direction?
[20:17:45] <_flood> procmon has no access denieds, i have rechecked the previlieges for sql agent, and it has them
[20:17:55] <_flood> i don't want to leave the sql agent running as local admin
[20:18:15] <monr0e> _flood I had an unusual situation a few years ago where the server agent would only run as a network service. Might this be a solution?
[20:18:31] <PublicWifi> int0x1C8: have you tried running procmon and opening the app as a standard user?
[20:18:36] <PublicWifi> it would tell you what the app is trying to access
[20:18:41] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> I've seen similiar, and I ended up effectively putting it as local admin
[20:18:48] <PublicWifi> and you can maybe just allow it those few things to avoid your users being local admins

[20:19:13] <MarsSpiral> it doesnt seem accurate on glassdoor
[20:19:49] <PattyCakes> MarsSpiral, you gotta do some fake math and assumptions
[20:20:15] <PattyCakes> and honestly experiance. Get laughed out of the interview enough times, you know a feel of how to ask
[20:20:18] <PublicWifi> int0x1C8: i had to do this for an app a couple years ago, it just needed some obscure registry permission
[20:20:24] <MarsSpiral> like it says 80k for nyc
[20:20:28] <PattyCakes> yea, that's BS
[20:20:57] <PattyCakes> places like NYC, Lots of California, and I'm sure anything in the North East, you basically add 100k to the national average
[20:21:07] <monr0e> _flood: have you checked the following domain permissions: SeServiceLogonRight, SeChangeNotifyPrivilege, SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege, SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege, SeNetworkLogonRight?
[20:21:11] <PattyCakes> again, that's a lot of assuming, and some fake math
[20:21:17] <PattyCakes> but that gives you a good place to start
[20:21:39] <MarsSpiral> yeah so im guessing 100k is normal for nyc, right 
[20:21:55] <MarsSpiral> just wondering cause im waiting for a job offer and they said
[20:21:59] <PattyCakes> I mean, I wouldn't live on it
[20:22:00] <MarsSpiral> they are "salary benchmarking"
[20:22:05] <MarsSpiral> before giving my offer lol
[20:22:08] <PattyCakes> run
[20:22:10] <PattyCakes> fast
[20:22:10] <PattyCakes> far
[20:22:14] <MarsSpiral> y
[20:22:20] <killdash9> I ask friends in the industry. But after all the time I've been in it it's pretty easy to have people I know in every city
[20:22:35] <PattyCakes> Uhh, MarsSpiral, because they are making you play a game for your salary
[20:22:35] <MarsSpiral> is salary benchmarking bad or something?
[20:22:39] <PattyCakes> don't play games with my money
[20:22:41] <PattyCakes> fuck you, pay me
[20:22:58] <MarsSpiral> doesnt that just mean they dont know whats the going rate for the job
[20:23:17] <MarsSpiral> honestly im not desperate to leave anyway so its whatever if it doesnt work out
[20:23:20] <PattyCakes> It could mean a thousand things
[20:23:30] <PattyCakes> but the biggest thing it means is that they don't know what they want to pay
[20:23:34] <PattyCakes> and that's a huge red flag
[20:23:49] <PattyCakes> You finalize a salary band before you go interviewing
[20:24:09] <PattyCakes> You then ask the applicant what their expectations are
[20:24:15] <MarsSpiral> oh
[20:24:19] <MarsSpiral> i dodged all those questions
[20:24:20] <PattyCakes> if they kinda match, then you start interviewing and see where in that band they land
[20:24:31] <MarsSpiral> 3 people asked me salary expectation questions and i said market rate
[20:24:39] <PattyCakes> oh, that's your fault partly
[20:24:42] <PublicWifi> I usually say
[20:24:42] <MarsSpiral> yeah i figured
[20:24:44] <PattyCakes> you left it ambiquious
[20:24:51] <PublicWifi> "market rate, which is X dollar per year"
[20:24:58] <PattyCakes> ^
[20:25:00] <PublicWifi> means you've done your research and have a number
[20:25:03] <PublicWifi> so you know your worth
[20:25:03] <PattyCakes> and to find that is the crux of your question
[20:25:08] <MarsSpiral> i thought its better to give the number at the end once you have a offer, cause it gives u more leverage
[20:25:09] <PattyCakes> how do you find market rate in a city with a COL
[20:25:22] <PattyCakes> which is what I answered. "Fake math, and experiance"

[20:27:19] <PublicWifi> but it makes sense, my area is stupid low COL
[20:27:19] <PattyCakes> lets try this MarsSpiral, what's the job?
[20:27:36] <PattyCakes> like the title, or role
[20:27:38] <PublicWifi> housing is where NYC gets insane
[20:27:44] <PublicWifi> its like almost 300% higher than my area
[20:28:00] <MarsSpiral> Systems admin, seems like your typical role with the only thing that seems different is that the windows infrastructure is all hosted in aws
[20:28:18] <MarsSpiral> like your typical sysadmin role at small company (network, end user tickets, mdt image, siem, etc)
[20:28:29] <PattyCakes> so lets say market rate for that role, in my experiance, in my area is in the high mid 60s
[20:28:33] <MarsSpiral> i pay 1600$ for rent lol
[20:28:46] <PattyCakes> so take that $65k/year and put it into a calculator like PublicWifi gave
[20:28:50] <PublicWifi> my city is below average for all costs in US according to this site, that's neat
[20:29:00] <PublicWifi> also take it with a grain of salt lol
[20:29:01] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> mines below as well
[20:29:10] <sd> 06<o‚Äãnenerdyguy> but thats only if you're not trying to buy a house right now
[20:29:19] <PattyCakes> like I said, there's a TON of fake math involved
[20:29:21] <PattyCakes> it's a skill honestly
[20:29:24] <PattyCakes> you just kinda learn it
[20:29:31] <MarsSpiral> im thinking real avg salary for sysadmin in NYC is 100k
[20:29:37] <MarsSpiral> and high end is 150-160k 
[20:29:38] <PublicWifi> yeah i've been trying to get my wife to let me kick her family out of our rental home and sell the damn thing xD
[20:29:41] <PattyCakes> you're probably not far off
[20:29:42] <MarsSpiral> low end is like 70-80k for msps
[20:29:51] <PattyCakes> so in your case MarsSpiral, I would have come in at 120k for that job
[20:29:55] <PublicWifi> I bet I could make double when i owe
[20:29:56] <PattyCakes> gives me room to negotiate lower if needed
[20:29:59] <PublicWifi> what I owe*
[20:30:06] <PattyCakes> but I wouldn't say 100k off the bat
[20:30:08] <PublicWifi> Yeah you wanna highball a bit
[20:30:09] <PattyCakes> that's how you end up getting lowballed
[20:30:10] <MarsSpiral> yeah imma go for that, tbh my total comp right now is around 130-140k but im I'd take 120k salary cause its 99% WFH

[20:31:07] <_flood> monr0e: how do i confirm those domain permissions?
[20:31:19] <MarsSpiral> honestly i think the key to a high WFH paying job is one where its not 99% wfh, requires you to go into office every so often, so they still have to pay High COL salary
[20:31:26] <PattyCakes> it almost never fails through PublicWifi. 6-12 months after I get laughed at?
[20:31:33] <PattyCakes> a recruiter contacts me, saying they have a new role open

[20:33:44] <PattyCakes> The job is no different if I do it in buttfuck nowhere Texas, or NYC
[20:33:45] <MarsSpiral> @pattycakes yeah but how do u compete w/ low COL employees from a high col area
[20:33:49] <PattyCakes> I'm worth, what I feel I'm worth
[20:33:49] <PublicWifi> one could argue he is taking care of himself
[20:33:50] <PattyCakes> I don't
[20:33:51] <PublicWifi> :)
[20:33:53] <PattyCakes> I don't need to MarsSpiral 
[20:33:55] <PublicWifi> <3 you tho
[20:33:59] <MarsSpiral> lol im not that good yet
[20:34:03] <fritzwastaken> Medical professionals wouldnt, and I trust those over libertards
[20:34:12] <PattyCakes> You are only worth what you think.
[20:34:16] <PublicWifi> there's plenty of medical pros that say its not a good idea
[20:34:17] <PattyCakes> Where's that PublicWifi motivational speaker when I need him
[20:34:22] <PublicWifi> BRO
[20:34:25] <PattyCakes> LETS GO
[20:34:31] <PublicWifi> YOU NEED SOME POSITIVITY UP IN THIS BITCH?!
[20:34:37] <PattyCakes> MARSPIRAL DOES
[20:34:49] <PattyCakes> TELL HIM HOW MUCH HE'S WORTH!
[20:35:06] <PublicWifi> MarsSpiral: DONT LET YOUR IMPOSTER SYNDROME TRICK YOU INTO THINKING YOU'RE WORTH LESS IN THE MARKET
[20:35:10] * PattyCakes sits back and watches the granade he just pulled the pin on
[20:35:21] <PublicWifi> how long you been in the game MarsSpiral ??
[20:35:36] <MarsSpiral> @PublicWifi like 3 years full time as a sysadmin
[20:35:43] <MarsSpiral> 1-2 years a helpdesk intern
[20:35:54] <PublicWifi> hmmmmmm
[20:36:01] <PattyCakes> Yea, honestly, you're doing pretty well already MarsSpiral 
[20:36:05] <PublicWifi> Yeah...
[20:36:05] <PattyCakes> you might just be at your cap for the role
[20:36:07] <PublicWifi> LOL
[20:36:09] <MarsSpiral> well
[20:36:17] <MarsSpiral> i started at 65k
[20:36:19] <PublicWifi> I mean Im' all about dreaming big though, fake it till you make it lol
[20:36:19] <PattyCakes> I mean, even PublicWifi can't motivate the market to pay more
[20:36:21] <PattyCakes> the market is what it is
[20:36:25] <MarsSpiral> then ive been getting big raises every year and now im 100k lol
[20:36:25] <PublicWifi> are you in a big city MarsSpiral ?
[20:36:32] <PublicWifi> WTF
[20:36:33] <MarsSpiral> bonuses have been pretty good too, 15-30%
[20:36:36] <MarsSpiral> every year
[20:36:36] <PublicWifi> 100K on your third year???
[20:36:38] <PattyCakes> yea MarsSpiral, I have some shitty news
[20:36:40] <PattyCakes> you're doing great
[20:36:42] <MarsSpiral> yeah i got a 25% bonus
[20:36:42] <PattyCakes> keep at it
[20:36:44] <MarsSpiral> 25% raise*
[20:36:47] <PublicWifi> yeah... 3 years in thats dope dude
[20:36:49] <PattyCakes> that's imprssive
[20:36:57] <PublicWifi> making 305 more than me and I've been in it for 5
[20:36:58] <PattyCakes> even in a high COL place
[20:36:59] <PublicWifi> 30%
[20:37:09] <MarsSpiral> yeah the bonus is insane, but im guessing cause its finance
[20:37:12] <MarsSpiral> thanks
[20:37:23] <PublicWifi> yeah you killin it
[20:37:25] <PublicWifi> love to see it
[20:37:26] <PattyCakes> Damn, now I gotta pay PublicWifi for his services and no one got motivated
[20:37:27] <PublicWifi> xD
[20:37:31] <LarchOye> you're gonna have to start getting a lot of high-value certs soon
[20:37:36] <MarsSpiral> the other thing i wasnt sure was this other company isnt in the finance space, so I'd lose those bonuses lol
[20:37:42] <PattyCakes> This will be reflected on your yelp review PublicWifi 
[20:37:50] <LarchOye> experience alone isn't enough when you're above 100k to land the bigger jobs
[20:37:54] <PublicWifi> i've noticed on job posting, 5 years exp is the first big door opening
[20:38:00] <PublicWifi> next is 7, and then 10+ for some reason
[20:38:12] <PublicWifi> PattyCakes: XD
[20:38:12] <MarsSpiral> dude i checked the salary for those top hedge fund places
[20:38:13] <MarsSpiral> its nuts
[20:38:14] <PattyCakes> LarchOye, I mean not true
[20:38:18] *** Joins: REdOG (~REdOG@12.208.129.126)
[20:38:21] <MarsSpiral> its like 150k-250k
[20:38:24] <PattyCakes> certs only latter if you wanna skip the 3 years of exp needed
[20:38:28] <PattyCakes> only matter*
[20:38:32] <MarsSpiral> im sure its stressful as fuck tho
[20:38:36] <PublicWifi> I'd revisit the search in a couple years and I bet you can make a nice jump
[20:38:41] <misspwn> https://imgur.com/a/5hvMWbL currently happening across the street....a dog poop removal service
[20:38:59] <PattyCakes> LarchOye, what I think you meant to say is that at 200k certs start mattering again
[20:39:03] <fritzwastaken> misspwn: my parents would honestly probably pay for that
[20:39:12] <MarsSpiral> @Publicwifi yeah thats why im not sure about leaving. my current place gives me big bonuses, big raises,i just hate going to the office and we're going back to a hybrid model (and i suspect full return eventually)
[20:39:14] <PattyCakes> you can easily move around in the 100-200k rnage without certs
[20:39:21] <LarchOye> without the right certs, you won't have exposure to the kinds of budgets and equipment/software that you need experience in to get the bigtime jobs
[20:39:36] <PattyCakes> yea, but those jobs aren't in that 100-200k range normally LarchOye 
[20:39:37] <misspwn> fritzwastaken, i mean i would probably pay for that if i had a dog and no kids
[20:39:37] <Riviera> what kind of certs are you talking for 200k jobs?!
[20:39:39] <LarchOye> I mean maybe
[20:39:48] <MarsSpiral> @riviera management certs maybe
[20:39:49] <PublicWifi> MarsSpiral: yeah... and honestly having drive to grow and improve and find better places is great
[20:39:49] <MarsSpiral> lol
[20:39:59] <PublicWifi> KAKFA CERTS
[20:40:01] <Riviera> MarsSpiral: .. like what? :)
[20:40:04] <MarsSpiral> yeah, part of the reason why im leaving is b/c im pretty bored
[20:40:05] <PublicWifi> ;P
[20:40:05] <fritzwastaken> misspwn: my parents just let the dogs out in the backyard and mow over the shit every few months
[20:40:07] <PattyCakes> there are absolutely fields in Non-Management in IT that pull 200k Riviera 
[20:40:11] <Riviera> pmp perhaps, but i doubt that lands 200k
[20:40:12] <MarsSpiral> im bored and i want a more WFH position lol
[20:40:17] <PublicWifi> fritzwastaken: that what I do LOL
[20:40:18] <Riviera> PattyCakes: yeah
[20:40:23] <Hunterkll> man these old FCC enforcement notices are fucking wild
[20:40:25] <Riviera> PattyCakes: i asked something else th0
[20:40:26] <PublicWifi> gotta spray turds off my mower tires every time xD
[20:40:26] <PattyCakes> Anything architect
[20:40:28] <PattyCakes> oh
[20:40:34] <PattyCakes> I mean, with just certs alone?
[20:40:41] <Riviera> 'cause nah
[20:40:42] <PattyCakes> THere's a few accounting certs I can obtain that would be 200k/year
[20:40:48] <LarchOye> but the hardest thing for me is always getting my hands on high buck gear to set up complex deployments and such
[20:40:58] <PattyCakes> financial crimes is a big one
[20:41:03] <PublicWifi> yeah it helps to live in a bigger city then
[20:41:05] <PattyCakes> LarchOye now that's a fair point
[20:41:11] <LarchOye> build real fabrics and set up SANs and clusters and all that good shit...
[20:41:12] <PublicWifi> cause you have more opprotunity to find a job that can expose you to that stuff
[20:41:15] <PattyCakes> to be expose to the tech to get those bigger gigs, you need some real money
[20:41:20] <PattyCakes> and some real money is going to hire people for real money
[20:41:21] <fritzwastaken> ok im officially home now. Time to turn on the autoclicker and crack a beer
[20:41:22] <PublicWifi> us small town guys struggle with getting our hands on anything 
[20:41:25] <PattyCakes> so I guess I'll say you're kinda right LarchOye 
[20:41:29] <Riviera> but ok, got it, y'all think architect certs land 200k jobs
[20:41:32] <PattyCakes> it's harder to do, but it still can be done
[20:41:48] <fritzwastaken> PublicWifi: that switch I recevied actually retails for 300k, the used version was 150
[20:41:57] <fritzwastaken> 60 port 100gb
[20:42:01] <PattyCakes> Riviera, are you like actually hating on the people that figured it out?

[20:42:39] <PattyCakes> I'm not claiming to make 200k, I'm just saying it's not magic how to get there. Certs help, but don't guarantee it
[20:42:49] <LarchOye> fritzwastaken: you guys only have one of em though?
[20:43:16] <Hunterkll> PattyCakes: yea, I mean, getting halfway there isn't even thta hard, after that it's just job hopping/promotions
[20:43:28] <PattyCakes> there's a ceiling though Hunterkll 
[20:43:36] <PattyCakes> that 125k ceiling seems to be a hard one to shatter
[20:43:39] <Hunterkll> eventually you become manglement 
[20:43:42] <Hunterkll> eh i know plenty who have
[20:43:50] <PattyCakes> didn't say you can't shatter it
[20:43:52] <Hunterkll> you mi ght have to switch industries a bit sometimes, or locations 
[20:44:01] <PattyCakes> I just said it wasn't as easy as going from 40k to say 80k
[20:44:05] <PattyCakes> or from 80-100k
[20:44:14] <Hunterkll> i'll break through that easily just with annual raises over time if i'm lazy about looking/negotiating 
[20:44:22] <PattyCakes> going from 100 to 125 has taken me longer than the trip to 100k did
[20:44:35] <PublicWifi> fritzwastaken: damn!

[20:44:39] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> based on /r/sysadmin you'd think everyone was making 180K

[20:45:13] <PattyCakes> I mean, 180k is starting for Senior
[20:45:19] <vinrock> based on r/sysadmin id assume theyre all making $20/hr
[20:45:20] <MarsSpiral> 180k wtf lol

[20:45:24] <Hunterkll> lmao

[21:06:34] <PublicWifi> that's one thing I really, really struggled with

He happened to be on my floor too. When he left the elevator all his shit feel out everywhere he was carting in, and I helped him pick it all up and started some small talk. 
[21:10:07] <PublicWifi> He was grateful I took time to help him and whatnot

[21:10:37] <PublicWifi> asked me if I was local and wanted a job
[21:10:39] <PublicWifi> LOL
[21:10:45] <PattyCakes> PublicWifi, boils down to this. Just be a good person, and if other people aren't good to you - it's because they've got shit going on and didn't have the energy to be a good person
[21:10:47] <PattyCakes> and sometimes, that's ok
[21:10:58] <PattyCakes> but if you have the energy to be a good person, and actively make the choice to be a dick
[21:10:59] <PattyCakes> that's on you
[21:11:05] <PublicWifi> if someone else isn't good to you it means they don't have their shit in order
[21:11:14] <PublicWifi> and you have nothing to gain by being affected by it
[21:11:17] <PattyCakes> ^
[21:11:20] <signofzeta> Good for you, PublicWiFi.  Sometimes karma is all you get.  Sometimes you get more.

[21:12:19] <PattyCakes> at the end of the day, I feel good about myself no matter what
[21:12:25] <PattyCakes> either I made the day of a person who was having a rough one
[21:12:28] <PattyCakes> or I got under an assholes skin
[21:12:45] <signofzeta> LOL, I agree completely
[21:12:52] <PublicWifi> my gym buddy makes fun of me cause Ill strike up convos anywhere with anyone. I actually hate talking to people. But I learn a ton from them and sometimes they can be important people and you'd have no idea
[21:13:25] <PattyCakes> I'll give you the time of day, and if you reciprocate - I never MIND having a conversation (if I'm not like running to catch a flight or late for something)
[21:13:38] <PattyCakes> but I fully understand the hate for the guy that just going around talking to everyone nonstop
[21:13:39] <signofzeta> Yeah, but sometimes I strike up a conversation with a stranger and they're just an awful person.  fortunately, that's rare.  These days, I'm receptive, but I usually keep to myself otherwise.  Unless I have a good joke.
[21:13:50] <PublicWifi> yup its a double edged sword
[21:13:57] <PublicWifi> lol
[21:14:16] <PublicWifi> i recently learned this guy that frequents the gym I go to runs the largest factory in our area
[21:14:23] <PattyCakes> even myself, who tries really hard to be kind, has a bad/long day
[21:14:23] <signofzeta> like when some guy at the bar was complaining that Chevrolet used "like a rock" in their advertising, which was from a song by... I forget, Neil Young?  I piped up, "At least it wasn't Trojan!" [the condom maker]
[21:14:33] <PattyCakes> and sometimes, I just need you to shut the fuck up and leave me alone
[21:14:36] <signofzeta> we're still friends today
[21:14:36] <PattyCakes> at least I'm nice about it

[21:16:31] <PublicWifi> exactly
[21:16:37] <PattyCakes> for all I'd know, that baby daddy would become a billionare
[21:16:41] <PublicWifi> maybe we can move the needle towards "good" ever so slightly in the world right?
[21:16:45] <PattyCakes> and because I was nice to him, now I have a contract managing his whatever

[21:17:13] <PattyCakes> just don't ACTIVELY go out of your way to hurt someone else
[21:17:14] <signofzeta> so true.  six months ago, I worked for some guy who said the world was going to hell and was actively making it worse.  "You do remote work during a pandemic?  Well, you're going to keep doing it in my office!" for starters.  Then told me I was overpaid.  Now, I work from home for another company making twice as much.
[21:18:00] <PublicWifi> change is hard for some
[21:18:00] <PattyCakes> Unless burning a bridge satisfies a sick inner problem I have, and the only way to come to grips with that problem is a can of gas and a fucking match

[22:43:50] <signofzeta> the VP of the company is not related, but after fifteen years, he basically follows every order.  but, at one point, he demanded to be removed from ownership because of the boss's idiocy, and he did do.  We went from $SHITHOLE LLC to $SHITHOLE Inc. at the start of a new tax year.
[22:44:32] <signofzeta> I pulled the business info from our state's business info portal. the old company died. the new company was born with shares distributed to non-specific entities.
[22:48:28] <signofzeta> and I got a notice from the bank saying the $50 promotional credit i got for opening an account was OH NO taxable.  plugged it into my tax software.  looks like I only get $49. BOO FUCKING HOO

[22:51:51] <fritzwastaken> the sons were absolute morons but since dad made the company they get to be managers
[22:52:08] <fritzwastaken> One was an accountant and the other was a construction site manager
[22:52:21] <fritzwastaken> that means they can manage an MSP right?

[23:28:00] <PublicWifi> Cl0udNinja: :(
[23:28:10] <Cl0udNinja> we had some power issues a few weeks ago, and I made myself a DR solution on VM so I could continue working when half the DC's power was out

[23:31:35] <fritzwastaken> I wish Teams had slack style chat

[23:31:59] *** Quits: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa) (Client Quit)
[23:32:00] <fritzwastaken> like actual chat, not a group of conversations
[23:32:15] <fritzwastaken> signofzeta: im talking chat like irc or discord
[23:32:20] <Cl0udNinja> Ive never seen teams, I need an example

[23:32:33] <Cl0udNinja> fuck my lif
[23:32:34] <fritzwastaken> yea
[23:32:55] <Cl0udNinja> signofzeta, slack looks more like discord chat really
[23:33:06] <Cl0udNinja> not entirely, but close
[23:33:08] <fritzwastaken> Teams gets the job done, and works really well for task oriented conversation
[23:33:14] <fritzwastaken> but isnt great for just general chatter
[23:33:23] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> I think that's on purpose
[23:33:37] <fritzwastaken> right, thats why im saying I wish they had a tab you could add that was just "chat"
[23:33:37] <Cl0udNinja> man idk what we would do without custom emojis and /giphy at work
[23:33:57] <killdash9> never used Teams. Does it support the only way to really get points across, animated GIFs?
[23:34:01] <fritzwastaken> cause their current chat should be "conversations"

[23:34:13] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> killdash9: why?
[23:34:15] <fritzwastaken> oh yea its got emojis and gifs

[23:34:23] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[23:34:24] <signofzeta> Cl0udNinja: I know Discord. Teams has threads, and you can reply to root-level topics, but no replies to replies.
[23:34:25] <Cl0udNinja> look at this loser
[23:34:27] <Cl0udNinja> using words
[23:34:27] <fritzwastaken> I just wish it had enter by enter chat like discord or slack
[23:34:38] <fritzwastaken> as well as conversation based communications
[23:34:53] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> Cl0udNinja: Our CEO prefers words over GIFs
[23:34:55] <Cl0udNinja> signofzeta, yeah I was talking about what slack is like comparatively, and giving you something to compare it to
[23:35:04] <Cl0udNinja> sysadmin: sounds like a lame place to work
[23:35:13] <killdash9> since when does the CEO's opinion matter
[23:35:17] <Cl0udNinja> also that
[23:35:19] <Cl0udNinja> :D
[23:35:36] <Cl0udNinja> seriously though, like half or more of our conversations at work involve gifs
[23:35:39] <fritzwastaken> since when do CEOs use chat software? Ive never had a CEO who went beyond email

[23:38:48] <Cl0udNinja> sometimes during pairing I'll be on camera, just because I know certain people have to see the person or its weird for them
[23:39:00] <Cl0udNinja> idk whats up with that, but theres like 3 people in the place I work who are like that
[23:39:12] <Cl0udNinja> even if they arent looking at the camera screens
[23:39:20] <signofzeta> my previous employer repeatedly chastised me for not responding to email, not emailing enough, or sending bad emails. my current employer just shouted me out for excellent communication over Teams and our PSA.
