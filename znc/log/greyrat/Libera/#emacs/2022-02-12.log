[00:06:52] <Bayes> can somebody try to help me get but that last bit means, predetermined blocks rather than the entirety of the code?

[03:25:32] <edgar-rft> AFAIK major/minor-mode keymaps shadow the global keymap, so probably the only way is to unbind the respective key in the mode-speific keymap.

[03:34:56] <hashfunc1336> lemacs_zzz: i would recommend changing them as a last resort. and just one last piece of advice: if you find yourself running into conflicts with packages in any-which-way, that might mean that you have too many packages. stock emacs, by itself, has enough features to be as productive as you need to be. this is just from my experience
[03:36:42] <hashfunc1336> although, i wish stock emacs had  built-in lsp support. but the line has to be drawn somewhere
[03:37:09] <lemacs_zzz> I'll try, but I must admit that some packages make my emacs experience much much better, which-key for example, or ivy+counsel+swiper (I know there's ido), I think it'd be great to have something like that built in
[03:37:36] <Aurora_v_kosmose> hashfunc1336: Eglot being in Elpa suggests that the copyright papers have been filed, so in theory there's no reason it couldn't be added, I think.

[03:40:35] <lemacs_zzz> corwin oh, got it, I meant to answer the last part about stock emacs being enough, I think the convenience of a few packages would make it more accessible at least
[03:40:55] <lemacs_zzz> hashfunc1336 you don't use any package to replace them?
[03:42:23] <lemacs_zzz> it's hard for me to imagine using emacs without fuzzy search in M-x or C-s
[03:43:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Technically by default it does have it, it just doesn't have a redrawing vertical display of the matches.
[03:44:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Vertico being in Elpa, it could also be added to the core.

[15:48:50] <twb> aidalgol: OK so you know how most mammals can be milked?  Is there a summary table of litres milked per species per year?  I was bumbling through steam's worst games and it made me wonder whether "horse farm" is a dairy or a slaughterhouse
[15:49:39] <twb> oh dear... apparently horse milk is one of those "health" products, like kale and colloidal silver and amethyst crystals
[15:50:13] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[15:54:05] <bkhl> "In Mongolia, the milking season for horses traditionally runs between mid-June and early October. During one season, a mare produces approximately 1,000 to 1,200 litres of milk" (Wikipedia about Kumis)
[15:54:52] <bkhl> From what I understand horses make enough milk it was an important staple in central Asia since way back, so it's not that weird.
[15:57:10] <twb> yeah i'm just annoyed because the "does horse milk cure cancer?" type crap drowns out search results
[15:58:08] <artefact> wouldn't it be called mare milk?
[15:58:13] <twb> The bos bias is making it hard to find much at all
[15:58:36] <twb> artefact: you mean like how we say "nanny cheese" instead of "goat cheese" ?
[15:59:00] <artefact> in french we say chèvre, not bouc
[15:59:14] <bkhl> That's another one of my favurite etymologies by the way.
[15:59:26] <twb> renard is definitely funnier
[15:59:33] <twb> There's a french word for fox
[15:59:37] <bkhl> There's some evidence sinitic languages got "ma" from horse from the same indoeuropean word that we have "mare" from in Sweden.
[15:59:39] <artefact> nobody says goupil anymore
[15:59:45] <twb> but this one fox was so popular, everyone just names foxes after him
[16:00:03] <bkhl> And Thai has "ma" for horse as well, so it's one of those rare word that are in both Swedish and Thai from ancient roots
[16:00:07] <twb> it's like if English just started calling all dogs "Grommit"
[16:00:13] <artefact> or all foxes "swiper"
[16:00:32] <bkhl> (shared ancient roots I mean)
[16:00:58] <bkhl> And it's not mare in Swedish, it's märr, but obviously also the same word.
[16:01:12] <artefact> in french it's... jument
[16:01:49] <bkhl> There's a bunch of those animal names in French and English where people started using a persons name for an animal and then it became the name of the animal.
[16:01:51] <bkhl> Like Robin.
[16:03:21] <artefact> though we have horse-related words using the vulgar latin root, the latin root, or the greek root. we're a mess
[16:05:29] <treflip> How hard is to add a bunch of custom buttons to the modeline? I want to make 4 small buttons which correspond to my exwm workspaces to switch between them using mouse. I tried using tab-bar for this, but it only manages window configurations, not frames, so floating exwm frames behave like sticky windows.

[23:35:35] <wasamasa> like, think of a single-file game
[23:35:44] <artefact> are you reinventing appimages?
[23:36:18] <bremner> clearly a task for org-mode
[23:36:36] <wasamasa> no, my scope is a bit clearer than that
[23:36:48] <wasamasa> you never ran one of these single-file games containing their own assets?
[23:37:14] <wasamasa> or programs extracting their own assets and running themselves?
[23:37:25] <bremner> no, but I accept that I am a weirdo
[23:37:28] <wasamasa> or self-extracting archives?
[23:37:35] <artefact> that's fairly simple. use proc gen or just named data sections in your executable
