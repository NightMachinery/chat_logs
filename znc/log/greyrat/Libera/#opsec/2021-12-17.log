[01:04:15] <Joanna> JimBuntu: I think there has been a concerted effort to get rid of marriage and pit boys and girls against eachother from an early age. From what I remember the being taboo thing to talk to opposite gender started when I was age six. I’m not sure where the idea came from . Probably tv. If anyone talked to another child who wasn’t the same sex they would be shamed.
[01:04:52] <jan6> it's not concerted
[01:05:51] <Joanna> As a result people are not allowed to get to know eachother while they are still non sex crazed children.
[01:06:35] <jan6> it was first a natural divide, and then declared unnatural to do anything else by zelaots, and nobody has bothered to try to change society till now (now, with lgbtq+ movement being big enough, it's gonna change...VERY slowly...)
[01:06:44] <jan6> people ARE allowed to know each other
[01:06:59] <jan6> kindergartens, at least here, are all play, no isolation
[01:07:18] <jan6> schools also have plenty of time to get to know others
[01:07:19] <Joanna> So this increases the likelihood of them making a bad choice of spouse and having a failed marriage which is exactly what some people want for everyone.
[01:07:39] <jan6> nobody WANTS failed marriages, you conspiracy theorist
[01:07:50] <jan6> well, other than the jewelers, I suppose
[01:08:49] <Joanna> jan6: it was ok in kindergarten but after that boys started becoming hostile . The boys that were hostile when I was six might have been older.
[01:09:15] <jan6> "started becoming hostile" doesn't prove anything
[01:10:12] <jan6> boys are naturally more prone to agressiveness, even purely biologically... of course, the "boys being boys" attitude often means they don't stop it, either
[01:11:03] <jan6> most of human everything stands on top of status quo, with innovation only being present where people want a better solution and are willing to work in the name of it
[01:11:38] <Joanna> A lot of people don’t want marriage at all especially men. They want to use women as unpaid prostitutes and then dump them. They don’t want lifetime commitment to a stable relationship or don’t believe it’s possible.
[01:12:16] <Joanna> The Boys were hostile to us because we were girls
[01:12:59] <Joanna> But not all boys were hostile when I was six. It got worse later.
[01:14:48] <Joanna> The women’s lib garbage turned women into competitors instead of future wives.
[01:15:52] <Bitweasil> Indeed it did.
[01:17:24] <jan6> <Joanna> A lot of people don’t want marriage at all especially men. --//-- They don’t want lifetime commitment
[01:17:31] <jan6> marriage != lifetime commitment
[01:17:47] <jan6> we're not in middle ages anymore
[01:18:01] <Joanna> It didn’t improve the lives of women it just kept them from spending time with their children and marginalized men.
[01:18:20] <jan6> it's lifetime only if you're following a religion that specifically prevents that
[01:19:03] <jan6> there's also no requirement to ever marry, it'll just grant a certain legal status automatically to the other person
[01:19:57] <Joanna> jan6: there are people who benefit from people being isolated and alone without any family to help them. People used to live in extended families not that long ago for most of human history.
[01:20:07] <jan6> sure
[01:20:10] <jan6> so what?
[01:20:41] <jan6> back in time, marriage's entire point was to move wealth and ownership of stuff
[01:21:16] <jan6> back then most people were not happy about their marriages themselves, but it had to be done
[01:21:37] <Joanna> It’s not about legal status it’s a vital relationship. Unfortunately the government wants to be involved in everything people do. Even some animals mate for life.
[01:22:07] <jan6> you don't marry, and you're not gonna have enough resources to feed your family, and if you do, you don't choose who you like, you choose who's rich enough, and not total garbage
[01:22:21] <jan6> it is legal status
[01:23:00] <jan6> real relationships don't depend on arbitrary status of "married" or "never gonna leave you" because you can't tell the future, you don't know if you'll start to absolutely hate the other person
[01:23:29] <jan6> you stay with the person because you like them, not because you're "married"
[01:23:32] <Joanna> People are just as unhappy picking their own spouses as they were when they had no choice . People make some very bad choices about who to marry most of the time I think.
[01:23:42] <jan6> there's always stupid people
[01:24:24] <Joanna> If you begin hating someone you probably didn’t choose well.
[01:24:42] <jan6> exactly
[01:24:49] <jan6> you don't KNOW if you chose well
[01:24:59] <jan6> because at the moment they might feel perfect match
[01:25:12] <jan6> but people change

[01:26:09] <jan6> you never know if they start having a drinking problem, willingly get involved in shady stuff, etc, and don't care of what your views are about that
[01:26:24] <Joanna> Men and women can’t get to know eachother without the relationship becoming sexual. In the old days decent women had chaperones along on their dates. Bullying them into sex was out of the question.
[01:26:50] <jan6> you can get to know each other
[01:26:55] <jan6> the same way you get to know friends
[01:28:19] <Joanna> If people got to know eachother as children instead of waiting until after puberty, their thinking might be more rational.
[01:29:08] <Joanna> All men want is sex without commitment these days.
[01:30:10] <Joanna> They just care about how the woman looks and if the woman is willing to have sex. That’s it.
[01:36:19] <jan6> and all women want is to have sex all day long. that's it
[01:36:20] <jan6> totally
[01:36:24] <jan6> no exceptions whatsoever

[01:44:46] <Joanna> I forgot to mention the smut industry has shaped men’s attitudes and expectations toward women in a bad way.
[01:46:13] <Joanna> It’s all a well funded effort which has been very successful.
[01:47:14] <jan6> the way one guy stared at you and offered you a ride home, doesn't mean most guys would even feel comfortable asking, nevermind driving you home, assuming that's all he wanted to do with no sinister thoughts
[01:48:03] <jan6> similarly the fact you might see or hear about X type men, doesn't mean there aren't millions or billions of totally different guys with very different views
[01:55:14] <Bitweasil> <Joanna> I forgot to mention the smut industry has shaped men’s attitudes and expectations toward women in a bad way. <-- Indeed.
[01:55:36] <Bitweasil> And if you dare question the porn industry, and what literally warping developing brains on an endless supply of unrealistic sex is doing to their brains, you're shouted down as some sort of prude.
[01:55:57] <Bitweasil> Despite huge evidence that it basically rots the brain, and leads to bits and pieces not working with an actual woman.
[01:56:30] <Bitweasil> PIED is a thing - Porn Induced Erectile Dysfunction.  Well established, well tested, easy enough to recover from among those who experiment with the unthinkable thing to "not watch porn for a while."
[01:56:44] <jan6> uh, please link for "evidence that it rots the brain"
[01:57:17] <Bitweasil> See below, if your brain can't get it up with an actual woman in front of you because it's grooved into porn, that's something I'm fine coloquially calling "rotting the brain."
[01:58:09] <Bitweasil> "Your Brain on Porn" is a decent read on the matter if one cares to dive in.
[01:58:16] <Bitweasil> Though it's much more aimed at boys/men.
[01:58:33] <jan6> well, setting unrealistic expectations isn't their fault
[01:58:48] <Bitweasil> Isn't... whose fault?
[01:59:10] <jan6> just like "using X shampoo doesn't necessarily give you luxurious hair" isn't the shampoo advertiser's fault
[01:59:17] <Bitweasil> Porn has about as much to do with real human sexuality as a kite has with flying an airplane.
[01:59:26] <Bitweasil> Ehm.  Huh?
[02:00:01] <Bitweasil> My stance is simple enough, porn is toxic to men and boys alike, and that our culture celebrates it is a very real problem.
[02:00:48] <jan6> porn is definitely not toxic, but it is an easy way to get your "fix", which helps it easily develop into a habit and/or addiction
[02:01:11] <jan6> and why men and boys, only?
[02:01:28] <Bitweasil> Well, simply, I don't know the impacts it has on women, if any, so I can't speak with any authority on that.
[02:01:43] <Bitweasil> I'm not saying "It doesn't," more of "I don't know."  Hasn't been an area of research for me.
[02:01:53] <jan6> alright, sure
[02:02:19] <Bitweasil> For instance, I'm fairly certain porn doesn't cause erectile dysfunction in women.  It can certainly cause unrealistic expectations, but how impactful that is... I don't know.
[02:02:40] <jan6> probably a lot
[02:09:44] <jan6> your expectations, and how often you do it, very much help set your "norms" you get used to, and stuff, if you expect something to be e.g. hot, it's gonna seem to be a little more than it would if you didn't think that, and if you dealt with uncomfortably-hot-but-not-burning stuff often enough, you would probably get used to it to the point of not particularly caring anymore, and given how sex is in
[02:09:45] <jan6> quite a big part in your head, it's most likely gonna have a significant effect on stuff like satisfaction, or how long you expect it to be and as such how your body prepares (e.g. if you only do "quickies", you're probably not gonna be prepared for a longer session, and if you prefer to drag it out, you're gonna not like "finished? what, I just got started!"), etc etc
[02:10:00] <jan6> obviously I'm no authority
[02:11:57] <jan6> imho porn is too boring to bother with, anyway
[02:12:09] <Bitweasil> There's that, but it seems to be a popular enough industry.
[02:12:16] <jan6> duh
[02:12:20] <jan6> people do what there's demand for
[02:12:33] <jan6> they want to get paid too, which they won't it nobody bothers to watch
[02:14:48] <jan6> just like youtubers might have a trend of "like subscribe and hit the bell" or how you might have a wave of different content, such as 2013 youtube being "fun nonsense by some guy in a basement", and 2020 youtube being "tutorial/gameplay/watch-me-do-this-ridiculous-stuff by some dude with at least 10-person crew, filmed and edited proffessionally, probably with a sponsor segment"
[02:16:07] <Bitweasil> And I'm happy not participating in 2020 YouTube. :)
[02:16:12] <jan6> you're not prohibited from uploading "fun nonsense" to youtube, it just won't get paid, and people who make it their entire job will get their videos pushed to people instead of you
[02:16:55] <jan6> also there's a lot of porn niches
[02:17:45] <jan6> like "regular human porn" and "drawn porn" and "animated porn" and "drawn/animated porn of your favourite characters" and a bazillion other genres

[02:19:01] <Bitweasil> *Shrug*  Ok.  No idea, actually.
[02:19:29] <jan6> and I know that, without ever bothing to care, even, lol
[02:19:45] <jan6> most of it is uninteresting to me
[02:23:51] <jan6> also I feel like the "how 2 sex" expectations are also gonna depend on how many actual women you know, even as normal friends, or whatever, it's one thing if you're mainly in heavily-male environment, and living alone or something, vs being in a mixed environment, with normal women/girls, and seeing how different, and "human" they are, normally, especially if you're good enough friends to see that
[02:23:52] <jan6> if they find someone attractive, they won't actually run over and immediately ask to suck dick, or something
[02:24:54] <jan6> a lot of it is just normal "common sense" thinking, and the main problem is that people don't *THINK* anymore, and not the fact that "porn rots brain" or "lizardmen politicians are spreading chemtrails and putting 5g in vaccines"
[02:25:36] <Bitweasil> If it's widely lacking, is it actually common anymore?
[02:25:42] <jan6> if you're exposed to only one way of doing things, and you never bother to ask "but is that the only way?", then of course you're gonna assume that's how it works
[02:25:44] <Bitweasil> (I'm heading out for the day shortly, though)
[02:25:53] <jan6> nowdays it is indeed "uncommon sense"
[02:25:54] <jan6> lol
[02:26:28] <jan6> similarly because things have always worked a certain way, nearly nobody bothers to consider if they could be done differently
[02:28:59] <jan6> like "I know we can videocall, mom, but what if...we actually met up?" or "I know cars are usually 4-wheeled, but...why not 3?" or "I know most people work set hours during the day, but...why *IS* that, actually?"
[02:32:09] <Joanna> Porn normalizes perverted behavior and violence and objectifies women. Also there is gay porn which normalizes that.
[02:33:04] <jan6> uh, 1) it doesn't normalize it, unless you're too young to watch it in the first place, or unless that's the main way you consume media
[02:33:07] <Joanna> Men come to have expectations that women do what they saw in some porno.
[02:33:14] <jan6> and 2) what do you have against the gays or lesbians?
[02:33:26] <jan6> SOME people are ALWAYS stupid
[02:33:45] <jan6> some women will also have expectations that black guys always have ultra-long dicks
[02:33:59] <jan6> doesn't mean that ALL, will
[02:34:48] <Joanna> jan6: people who make media should be responsible for every problem it causes and the problems caused by media are numerous and destructive.
[02:35:25] <jan6> similarly, SOME people will think that because some superhero could kill all the baddies and get away with praise, then they can, too
[02:35:54] <jan6> if they were responsible for that, then there wouldn't BE an media, because they'd be dead multiple times over
[02:36:27] <jan6> "car crashed because guy was reading news while driving, it's your fault you didn't detect that through the phone's GPS, and didn't refuse to show the news to hi"
[02:36:29] <jan6> *him
[02:36:31] <Joanna> People do what they see in media in most cases it’s unwise to expect otherwise.
[02:36:56] <jan6> media is almost always focused on what people want from it
[02:37:23] <jan6> if people buy more papers every time there's a tragedy, you can bet the newspaper's gonna prioritize more tragedies
[02:37:29] <Joanna> Cars that aren’t on rails should not exist to begin with they are always dangerous.
[02:37:35] <jan6> uh
[02:37:42] <jan6> cars on rails defeat the entire point of cars
[02:37:49] <jan6> which is that you can go anywhere
[02:37:56] <jan6> similarly horses not on rails shouldn't exist
[02:38:03] <jan6> because people have gotten trampled by horses before
[02:38:39] <Joanna> Cars are destructive for many reasons which I’ve already mentioned before.
[02:38:59] <jan6> and since people have killed other people with their bare hands, everyone should walk around with puffy rubber gloves on, so anyone hitting people would have a softer impact
[02:39:13] <jan6> of course, cars are horribly over-used in today's society
[02:39:30] <jan6> using your legs + public transport is way better
[02:40:34] <jan6> but there's a loooooot of places that's too far away for a bike ride and don't have public transport to there
[02:41:19] <jan6> pretty much anything that isn't a city or town
[02:42:32] <jan6> imho it'd be much better if most people used bikes and motorbikes, instead of cars
[02:42:49] <jan6> for one, you're probably only gonna have max 1 passenger
[02:43:11] <jan6> for two, you're probably not gonna be able to even drive it properly, when too drunk to drive
[02:43:37] <jan6> for three, lighter and more efficient, especially if you're mainly driving alone, anyway
[02:45:02] <jan6> for four, you're much less likely to get trapped, in the event you DO crash, motorbikes have airbags too, and normal bikes don't have much mass nor do they go terribly fast nor do they use combustible fuel
[02:47:06] <jan6> the only slight negative is you don't have an enclosed air pocket you can warm up, but that's minor comfort, it's not hard to dress warmly nowdays, when you can have pretty thin long underwear that keeps you warm enough to climb mountains, and is designed to be layered

[03:06:18] <Joanna> Cars are large dangerous poison gas spewing machines that depend upon fuel imported from faraway countries . They completely unnecessary and should be replaced with railways as should all airline travel over land.
[03:07:39] <Joanna> The fact that people are naturally violent is all the more reason that they shouldn’t be driving around in cars.
[03:09:10] <Joanna> Also horses will try to avoid trampling people if they are able to.
[03:23:05] <jan6> railways to random forests of beaches is VERY wasteful
[03:23:18] <jan6> but within cities/towns, and between those, definitely
[03:24:00] <jan6> cars make sense for getting to places where maintaining public transport routes isn't cost-effective
[03:25:28] <jan6> like if people go to some popular swimming beach only during summer, you're not gonna make a railway there, and you're not gonna make a railway go through random forests because maybe some people want to go to a forest and don't want to walk/cycle 10+km to get there (and later on back, too)
[03:26:31] <jan6> similarly villages might get a bus that goes by nearby like twice or thrice a day
