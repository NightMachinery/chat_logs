[05:59:45] <tellable6> 2021-06-12T20:21:19Z #raku <codesections> avuserow the most direct Raku translation of `for x in a.get("a", []): print(x)` is probably `for %a.keys { say %a{$_}}`
[05:59:56] <tbrowder> japhb: thnx, very helpful!
[06:00:01] <avuserow> I can do this as a starting point, I guess:
[06:00:06] <avuserow> m: class Foo {method a {...}; method foo {say "foo"}}; role FooR {method foo {...}; method bar {...}}; say so all([Foo.can(.name) for FooR.^methods])

[06:13:37] <moon-child> e.g. you couldn't say  'my FooR $x = Foo.new'
[06:17:11] <avuserow> okay, that makes sense
[06:18:02] <avuserow> and my code probably muddled things a bit. what I'm trying to do is say "I want an object as a parameter that has a `quote` method. probably a DBDish subclass of some sort, but I won't stop you from passing in another class"
[06:20:50] <avuserow> might just leave it untyped for now and let things happen

[06:27:52] <moon-child> in general it's better to not just assume that a method called 'quote' does what you want

[06:43:25] <avuserow> I guess. Within some domains, we do make these assumptions all the time. Sometimes it works well enough (maybe like `close` on file-like objects), sometimes less well (like how some languages use `+` to do both addition and string concatenation)
[06:44:47] <avuserow> though I looked, and this might be a moot point. Only one module in the ecosystem implements what I'm looking for, so this might just be better as a hard dependency

[17:29:11] <chronon> I've been holding back from really taking Raku into my heart, waiting for the language to settle, and for a comprehensive book in the style of "Programming Perl" that I can just cover to cover and be confident that I have not missed anything an expert should know about the language.
[17:30:32] <chronon> As far as I can see there are a fair few out of date Perl 6 books, and a number of Perl->Raku conversion books, and a few speciality books, but nothing that I can recognise as the once and final definitive guide.
[17:31:52] <chronon> I know myself well enough to know that I will do the cover to cover read once only, and then won't slog though any other thick books. So I'd like to get my choice of book right.
[17:32:24] <chronon> Can anyone recommend a thorough and complete Raku book, or at least tell me that they are working on one?
[17:38:05] <moritz> I don't think there is a thorough and complete book yet.
[17:38:28] <phogg> It's hard to be thorough and complete with a language this big
[17:42:15] *** Joins: _ed (~ed@ip174-70-136-148.ks.ks.cox.net)
[17:43:20] <chronon> Maybe, but I would pay good money for one, even if it were a multi volume boxed set. Indeed I'd prefer a non-repetative set of smaller books than a single huge doorstopper to lug around.
[17:46:39] <chronon> Finding random bits of the puzzle online never works for me. I really appreciate well structured information like Programming Perl was. No fluff, no baby stuff, just solid well structured information that treated the reader like an adult.

[19:23:46] <chronon> MasterDuke: So are we just living in a world where nobody values well structure well presented information? Are we now all just living in a forest of fragmented wiki docs and blogs none of which give the reader any understanding of the big picture? A world of cut&paste code fragments instead of anything approaching deep understanding?
[19:24:34] <ugexe> its a huge effort for such a big language, and writing books isn't exactly lucrative or even profitable in many cases
[19:25:07] <ugexe> of course we value those things... but there are other real world issues
[19:25:57] <chronon> Would it be possible for a community driven book to work? Each small and specialised chapter written by an expert in that aspect? Overseen structurally by someone with complete understanding who can tie it all together?
[19:26:14] <chronon> I bet if we put money in a pot for that it could work.
[19:27:06] <chronon> IT'll be hard for the language to grow a userbase without solid books to give people the confidence.
[19:28:05] <ugexe> if i was paid to write some chapters as an expert in some area i'd personally do it. definitely needs to be an inventive
[19:28:45] <moritz> my one attempt at a multi-author raku book project was an abject failure
[19:28:55] <chronon> Oh dear, why?
[19:29:08] <ugexe> s/inventive/incentive/
[19:29:58] <moritz> chronon: people weren't delivering their chapters (too much else to do), and the project didn't have the right structure to replace those authors
[19:30:23] *** Joins: ttubrian (~bd3i@24-155-162-157.dyn.grandenetworks.net)
[19:30:24] <chronon> So was that a matter of insufficient incentives?
[19:30:48] <moritz> also, after I felt I was one of maybe two authors who actually delivered, from a grand total of 5ish authors, I was getting frustrated
[19:31:19] <chronon> Inequalit yis a fact of life. Best to accept it for the greater good.
[19:31:27] <moritz> lack of incentives, lack of a deadlines and a way to deal with their expiry
[19:31:52] <chronon> Right, so you now have a lot of valuable experience of how to set up such a project in future.
[19:32:43] <moritz> some folks I really respected and liked working with didn't deliver, and I would have felt very weird going up to them and saying "you didn't write the chapter on $area-of-your-expertise, so I'm doing it, and you're not an author of this book anymore"
[19:33:10] <moritz> today, I would set up such a project very differently from the start, to deal more gracefully with such contingencies
[19:34:02] <chronon> It would have to be like a contract (separated from one's personal feelings of friendship and admiration). If it were me, I'd want to offer some money on a quality and readability score, but also have a deadline beyond which it all halved, and a second deadline beyond which the author was assumed to have failed and got nothing.
[19:34:48] <chronon> But importantly, the amount of money offered would have to be quite decent, the kind of money that excites people to wake up and crack on with it.
[19:35:25] <chronon> Thhe kind of money one can put aside other work for, to prioritise the writing.
[19:35:52] <chronon> I wonder if the Perl Foundation would consider it worth funding. (Don't know anything about how that works.)
[19:36:08] <moritz> that's not how it works, usually
[19:36:29] <moritz> writing a book is thousands hours of work
[19:37:08] <chronon> I've written large book-like documents in a matter of weeks. But then I've known a lot about what I was writing, so it flowed.
[19:37:20] <moritz> to be competitive with a good software engineer's salary, you'd have to raise in the order of 100..300k USD or so
[19:37:45] <moritz> that's not the order of magnitude that TPF deals in, nor that you can get funded by a kickstarter
[19:37:50] <moritz> nor from a publisher
[19:38:01] <moritz> it really needs to be a labor of love
[19:38:17] <chronon> Well, perhaps the answer then is to give the actual writing to a lower level person who might not get such high salaries, but make sure they have access to pester a higher level expert for clarifications and proofreadings.
[19:38:23] <moritz> and aligning enough authors to collaborate on such a labor of love is, well, difficult
[19:40:14] <chronon> I am "between jobs" at the moment and enjoy writing. If I were just a little more knowledgeable about Raku I might volunteer. But with my current level of knowledge I'd feel like a baby teaching the prime minister about tax policy.
[19:41:31] <chronon> Well, if my goal is to become more knowledgeable, what is the best place to get reasonably well structure and comprehensive information about Raku?

[19:42:44] * [Coke] whees, power outage last night.
[19:46:01] <ugexe> i learned from https://design.raku.org/ (which predates implementation so isnt entirely accurate although the spirit is usually correct) and from the raku source code (which used to be a lot less optimized/nqp and thus was pretty useful for even new people to learn from)
[19:47:19] <ugexe> its also taken me like 10(?) years to get to my level of proficiency so those likely arent very good alternatives
[19:48:51] <moritz> chronon: for well-structured I would recommend some of the books out there; they won't teach you everything there is to know about raku, but enough that you can do some projects on your own
[19:48:52] <ugexe> speaking of... zef turns 8 years old in 3 days
[19:49:47] <moritz> and then you can learn from the projects, docs, from here, stackoverflow etc.
[19:51:07] <chronon> Hmmm, you perople make learning Raku sound like learning Japanese or all of the works of Shakespeare or something.
[19:51:55] <ugexe> if you want to be an expert? perhaps
[19:51:58] <ugexe> to learn it, no
[19:52:17] <chronon> How much bigger and more complex is it than Perl 5? I thought Raku was in part at least a consolidation and tidy up of the warts. Which should make it easier to learn.
[19:54:34] <ugexe> significantly bigger and more complex than core Perl
[19:54:40] <chronon> Surely the basic language syntax, control flow, variables, types, operators, IO, and so on cannot be vastly bigger than Perl 5. Where is the complexity mostly? Is it in the regex grammar syntax, or Unicode handling, or async, or where?
[19:55:02] <ugexe> that doesnt mean its harder to learn, just that there is more to learn that is core to the language
[19:55:34] <ugexe> since I hope an expert perl programmer is not just using core Perl but the rest of their tools
[19:56:39] <ugexe> well there is OO, threads, and non-ref counting GC
[19:56:57] <ugexe> a beginner that is learning probably doesnt have to care about these things though
[19:57:05] <chronon> One of the things I always love about Perl 5 was the fact that there was so much in the core, and it was well integrated using contextual behaviour that did what you usually wanted.
[19:57:52] <chronon> Raku is more of that, adn so must feel even more empowering.
[19:59:06] <ugexe> honestly https://design.raku.org/ might be up your alley despite the disclaimer i made earlier
[20:00:22] <chronon> Hmm, I'll definitely check that out. Thanks.
[20:00:25] <chronon> I'm not a big fan of IDEs (I'm a vim freak) but has anyone tried and enjoyed Comma? Would using the community edition be a good way to learn my way through Raku?
[20:00:51] <tonyo> i use vim

[20:12:07] <chronon> moritz, when you and your crew were writing books, what were the prefered formats to write in? Were people using lightweight markups and converting?

[20:21:21] <chronon> Well, does anyone know someone who might have an opinion on that?
[20:23:03] <moritz> chronon: back in the days, we used some variant of POD; these days, I've mostly written stuff in Markdown
[20:23:27] <[Coke]> Note that many of the crew here are on european time, so responses may be delayed.
[20:23:42] <moritz> I love leanpub, which can render a book from markdown files in git, sell early versions, send updates to people when new version are avaialble etc.
[20:24:33] * [Coke] thanks chronon for the reminder to finally pick up a UPS.
[20:24:36] <chronon> Should be late afternoon in Europe I think.
[20:24:42] <chronon> hehe
[20:25:53] <chronon> I used to have several UPS supporting my routers and wifi antennae for a community wifi I set up. Powercuts were frequent out there. Laptop batteries would last, but no good if the wifi is down.
[20:26:27] <chronon> Be sure to get a UPS that allows you to silence the beeper if you want to retain your sanity. Not all do.
[20:27:11] <chronon> Oh is leanpub a site, or service, or software?
[20:27:17] <ugexe> easy enough to clip the speaker on them
[20:27:38] <chronon> I actually did that in some of mine. Just got too fed up.
[20:29:48] <chronon> I like reStructuredText. It feels well designed. Not perfect, but I think it is better than Markdown for large documents as it has quite a few bookish features.
[20:32:18] <chronon> Ok, I found leanpub.com so it is at least a site, what else I wonder?
[20:33:26] <chronon> Looks like they use Markdown (or MSWord but that's crazy).
[20:34:22] <chronon> One other issue I have with Markdown is the large number of variants and lack of standardisation. Which kind of Markdown are leanpub using i wonder.
[20:35:02] <chronon> Ok, enough thinking out loud on a publically logged channel. Bye for now.
