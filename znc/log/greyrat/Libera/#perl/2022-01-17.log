[15:18:21] <aquanight> if you mean why we have @thing = ( [ a, b, c ], [ d, e, f ] ); and such
[15:18:31] <aquanight> I would point out this is nothing unusual in the programming world
[15:19:55] <choroba> for n-dimensional arrays implemented in the C way, you need fixed size arrays which Perl doesn't have
[15:20:24] <gamo> ahhh, thanks choroba
[15:20:36] <aquanight> well, you "can" with an unfixed last dimension
[15:21:00] <aquanight> you're just using manual flattening via $index = ($x * X_DEPTH) + ($y * Y_DEPTH) + $z
[15:21:40] <gamo> yes, thnaks aquanight
[15:21:43] <aquanight> and I will even go as far as to stipulate you're doing exactly what C does with such an array
[15:22:28] <aquanight> then again, perl also has autovivification so the specifics of how the multidimensional array looks needs never be a thing you worry about
[15:22:29] <choroba> I'd reach for PDL if I needed that I guess
[15:22:41] <aquanight> you can jsut $whatever[$row][$column] = thing; and call it a day

[17:00:45] <mb> I have a question about File::Temp && Windows
[17:01:19] <mb> On windows, the way to determine where to put tempfiles is to check the %TEMP% environment value
[17:01:28] <mb> so this is what File::Temp does
[17:01:52] <mb> but the problem is that if you run perl under taint, environment variables are 'tainted' so you can't use them 
[17:02:07] <mb> so this means File::Temp falls back to use "C:\" as a tempdir location
[17:02:09] <mb> under taint
[17:02:13] <mb> which is not writable
[17:02:21] <LeoNerd> That is one of the standard problems with taint on windows, yes.

[17:25:57] <mb> xenu, I understand the part that taint mode is stupid
[17:26:09] <mb> i also understand that some people use it anyway
[17:26:39] <simcop2387> that leads to a logical induction
[17:26:55] <mb> (also, the part that removes the 'tainted' env variables on Win32, is in File::Spec::Unix 😥 )
[17:27:22] <LeoNerd> "X is a bad idea" => "Some people will do X anyway". Yup
[17:28:09] <mb> so I _thought_ that you CAN'T access %ENV in taint mode, but that's not true, you can.
[17:28:37] <ilmari> of course you can access it, you just can't use the values from it in any "critical" operation
[17:28:44] <mb> It's that File::Spec has some code that checks if TAINT mode is on and then decides to remove $ENV{'TEMP'} for I think no good reason
[17:28:52] <xenu> you can, but the idea behind taint mode is that accessing %ENV is extremely unsafe and you should verify its contents before using it
[17:29:05] <aquanight> mb: you can "clean" %ENV
[17:29:06] <xenu> and how do you valide it? well...
[17:29:23] <xenu> that's the part that the creators of taint mode didn't think through
[17:29:32] <mb> Yeah, so I wanted to 'clean' it as a 'patch' 
[17:29:35] <aquanight> ($ENV{TEMP}) = $ENV{TEMP} =~ m/^(.*)$/; if you're really sure you can trust what $ENV{TEMP} is pointing to
[17:29:51] <aquanight> but really if you ask me File::Spec should not be using %TEMP%
[17:29:52] <xenu> aquanight: you might just as well disable taint mode
[17:30:04] <mb> why should File::Spec not be using %TEMP%?
[17:30:09] <xenu> if you're going to use a no-op regex
[17:31:38] <aquanight> xenu: well yes
[17:31:44] <Altreus> What is the justification for trying to help people who won't implement the correct fix?
[17:31:57] <mb> I do not want to fix it for _me_ I want to fix it for other people
[17:32:05] <xenu> we should fix in the interpreter by removing the taint mode
[17:32:07] <mb> I see that you could also use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-gettemppath2w
[17:32:08] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ GetTempPath2W - Win32 apps | Microsoft Docs ]
[17:32:14] <aquanight> mb: because it should be using https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-gettemppath2a
[17:32:15] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ GetTempPath2A - Win32 apps | Microsoft Docs ]
[17:32:19] <aquanight> bah beat me to it
[17:32:25] <xenu> this api doesn't help at all
[17:32:29] <xenu> it reads the env variables
[17:32:29] <mb> but that API actually gets the location from the environment variable TEMP 
[17:32:38] <mb> so using that does not 'solve' any real problem
[17:32:43] <xenu> so conceptually it's equivalent to untainting with a no-op regex
[17:32:50] <xenu> and thus it's a blasphemy
[17:34:02] <aquanight> I mean
[17:34:16] <Altreus> The code isn't broken
[17:34:18] <mb> and again, I understand I should not be using taint, because it is not really making anything 'secure' 
[17:34:27] <mb> it just causes lots of work for no apparent gain
[17:34:29] <aquanight> deriving the location for temp files based on an environment variable is kinda stupid to begin with
[17:34:32] <aquanight> but that's Windows for you
[17:34:51] <Altreus> how do unices do it?
[17:34:57] <aquanight> Altreus: /tmp/
[17:35:03] <xenu> i unironically believe that the right solution is to remove the taint mode from perl, but unfortunately uninformed people defend it fiercely
[17:35:05] <mb> well, File::Spec also uses $ENV{'TMP'} so...
[17:35:06] <Altreus> is that a guaranteed path?
[17:35:08] <xenu> including some core devs unfortunately
[17:35:09] <aquanight> or at least I'm pretty sure that's what they do
[17:35:16] <xenu> i guess what we should do first is write some blogposts
[17:35:23] <LeoNerd> xenu: We have a plan to make it Configure-time optional for 5.36
[17:35:33] <Altreus> Anyway the point is that File::Temp is not broken
[17:35:37] <LeoNerd> So you'll be able to at least build yourself a perl that doesn't support it
[17:35:40] <aquanight> doesn't perl force taint mode when $< != $>
[17:36:03] <Altreus> The fix in question is on a par with "upgrade perl" and "don't use -w"
[17:36:07] <xenu> LeoNerd: i can do this right now, there's an #ifdef for that. the problem is this doesn't help unless it's enabled by default
[17:36:32] <LeoNerd> Yah.. so the plan is to get people to try it out, and report back on how things work.. and maybe we'll change the default afterwards
[17:39:10] <mb> so this is on linux, File::Temp uses the TMPDIR variable there:
[17:39:17] <mb> $ TMPDIR=~ perl -MFile::Spec -E 'say File::Spec->tmpdir()'
[17:39:17] <mb> /home/michiel
[17:40:18] <mb> LeoNerd: I can already use SILENT_NO_TAINT_SUPPORT or NO_TAINT_SUPPORT as configuration options
[17:40:39] <mb> If I use those, I get a perl that has taint as a 'no-op' or that makes taint fatal

[17:44:13] <mb> I asked him: it _is_ already optional, at least you can compile it out, what is different? 
[17:44:26] <LeoNerd> The difference is how you ask it to
[17:44:47] <LeoNerd> It's currently a _C_ compiler flag, which requires some awkward trickery to pass it through the Configure script

[17:46:53] <xenu> while ideologically i'm opposed to strawberry making decisions like that, it's a noble cause, so maybe it's an exception
[17:47:17] <Altreus> It is definitely not supported by #perl :D
[17:47:35] <LeoNerd> Last time it was properly discussed basically two people said "No please don't remove it because , er.. we want it for reasons" and we asked "OK what reasons?" and they went "errrm... *silence*"
[17:47:45] <xenu> it is (will be) an official flag, so i guess it's not that different from e.g. building with threads
[17:47:58] <xenu> it's not like strawberry would patch it out
[17:48:05] <LeoNerd> PSC are really not aware of any strong reasons for wanting to keep it

[19:50:30] <mmlj4> maybe the taint thing isn't my problem, but that's all I got from starting it with -d (debug)
[19:50:30] <aquanight> also not just goto &SUB;
[19:50:36] <aquanight> but also jsut &SUB; (perl4 style call)
[19:50:49] <ilmari> aquanight: «Prior to Perl 5.11, it also overwrote @_ with the list in void and scalar context.»
[19:50:54] <aquanight> I think I actually had reason to use &SUB; style call in recent memory but I can't remember for what purpose.

[19:55:05] <aquanight> &sub; doesn't create a new @_ frame
[19:55:14] <aquanight> so aliasing behavior is preserved
[19:55:20] <Altreus> yeah, but I never need that :)
[19:55:32] <aquanight> Altreus: ... the assumption is that in practice bar would probably do something besides just forward to foo
[19:55:32] <Altreus> Mostly cos aliasing behaviour is normally accidental
[19:55:51] <aquanight> eh. I like it for the "micro-optimization" potential
[19:55:52] <Altreus> Sure, but mutating @_ is already naughty
[19:56:07] <Altreus> now you're mutating someone else's @_ :o
[19:57:03] <aquanight> honestly the idea of "you can do X. But never do X because people hate it." is kinda silly. You can do cool things with @_ aliasing.
[19:57:15] <ilmari> huh, perl5120delta doesn't mention the split vs. @_ change, but perl5140delta has an Errata section which does mention that it was left out of perl5120delta
[19:57:34] <ilmari> I would have expected that to have been retroactively added to perl5120delta too
[19:57:56] <Altreus> aquanight: like taint mode? :D
[19:58:09] <Altreus> aquanight: also I vaguely remember auto-taint related to something like what you said
[19:58:18] <Altreus> I don't think $< has ever != $> so I have no idea
[19:58:37] <aquanight> I found it
[19:58:41] <aquanight> it's documented in perlsec

[19:59:03] <aquanight> so if
[19:59:18] <aquanight> for some *strange* reason you had a perlscript working as a setuid tool, it runs in forced taint mode
[19:59:36] <Altreus> assuming it's compiled in at all
[19:59:45] <aquanight> I wonder what the various no-taint compile flags do in that scenario

[20:02:49] <aquanight> or I just can't read and it's called in the next macro down
[20:05:07] <aquanight> Altreus: in any case, TAINTING_set is NOOP under NO_TAINT_SUPPORT so that probably settles the question

[20:24:11] <Altreus> but surely doing things to device files is tainted

[21:33:55] <krismatrix> Some questions on using Mojo::pg and keeping things secure. For the test code that I shared earlier, I had the credentials (password etc) hardcoded. Naturally, this is bad practice. I am wondering what do you guys do to keep things tight and secure?
[21:34:24] <Altreus> I don't hate it because of what it is
[21:34:47] <krismatrix> Do you simply place the password and other details in a flat file that the script reads to get the information? And if so, how is that more secure than having it in the script?
[21:35:02] <Altreus> I hate it because I don't use it, and it's not compatible with what I do use
[21:35:20] <Altreus> krismatrix: yes, Mojo has a config plugin that generally just works
[21:35:44] <Altreus> The idea is you don't commit the config file (you might commit an example) and you add it to .gitignore
[21:38:12] <krismatrix> ok...but the config file is in my development machine and my production machine right? Just not on github.

[21:46:57] <Altreus> Honestly there comes a point where security of production environments is someone else's problem and they can figure out how to secure the app :D
[21:48:25] <zgu> if the db is on another server you need tcp though
[21:48:52] <tm604> can't you just use a unix socket over nfs like a normal person
[21:48:53] <zgu> so either passwords or lock everything to a small trusted subnet
[21:49:02] <zgu> normal people do that?
[21:50:05] <tm604> hmm - if I find a normal person, I'll ask them
[21:50:47] <ilmari> or use tls and client certificates
[21:50:49] <tm604> but if the code is using service definitions (pgservice/pgpass) then it shouldn't need to care about connection details at all
[21:50:58] <ether> mojo's config plugin only reads perl code as a format, which IMO is weird (and insecure, although no one should be able to be pushing changes into your config file anyway).
