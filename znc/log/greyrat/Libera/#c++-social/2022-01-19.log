[15:16:02] <Carbonflux> still, it sounds powerful, hypersonic.
[15:16:56] <Carbonflux> hm, looking at the secret archives i do note the occasional reference to hypersonic winds in the tunnel, curious.
[15:19:46] <Carbonflux> yes, it appears that Tardigrades are able to produce hypersonic outgassing when they eat to much gluten.
[15:20:44] <Carbonflux> hm, there is even a technical term for it, THF, Tardigrade Hyper Fart.
