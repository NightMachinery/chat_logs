[00:11:30] <cryptic1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you‚Äôre referring to as Linux, is in fact, Log4j, or as I‚Äôve recently taken to calling it, Log Forge. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning Log Forge system made useful by the Log Forge corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[00:11:31] <cryptic1> Many computer users run a modified version of the Log Forge system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Log Forge which is widely used today is often called ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the Log Forge system, developed by the Log4j Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
[00:11:31] <cryptic1> Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine‚Äôs resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Log Forge operating system: the whole system is basically Log Forge with Linux added, or Log Forge/Linux. All the so-calle
[00:11:36] <cryptic1> d ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù distributions are really distributions of Log Forge/Linux

[05:38:02] <PrincessZoey> and my queue was under 2K at 7pm instead of 4k
[05:38:04] <Hunterkll> PrincessZoey: they announced the cause literally before the 24 hour downtime ended
[05:38:07] <Sousapro> I've been playing SWTOR recently on free tier lol

[05:42:31] <Sousapro> No kidding PrincessZoey lol
[05:42:42] <PrincessZoey> mfw we have queues 24/7 even not during an expansion launch
[05:42:47] <PrincessZoey> granted at 5am it's only like 40 people
[05:42:52] <Hunterkll> eh?
[05:42:52] <Sousapro> Jesus
[05:43:06] <Sousapro> That's crazy for queues
[05:43:09] <Hunterkll> PrincessZoey: during the WoW exodus, and before the "fixes" they did to help handle that load, I almost NEVER had a queue, at most maybe 20 
[05:43:13] <Hunterkll> no matter time of day
[05:43:45] <Hunterkll> then they added in the AFK kick timer like they do for expansions normally, and tweaked other shit to allow more logins on same hardware, and boom
[05:43:47] <Sousapro> I'll go play through FFXV instead for now
[05:43:48] <Hunterkll> queues every time
[05:43:48] <Hunterkll> lol
[05:43:53] <Sousapro> My PC no longer melts

[05:44:12] <Hunterkll> I play both. At the same time. With three instances of EVE open.
[05:44:13] <Hunterkll> >_>
[05:44:13] <PrincessZoey> Sousapro: getting my macbook and actually playing ffxiv at more than 10fps on ultra low was amazing

[05:44:32] <PrincessZoey> plus 120hz panel
[05:44:42] <Sousapro> It does not like 4K 
[05:44:42] <Hunterkll> Sousapro: I had to force it into using SLI to make it playable on my system
[05:44:51] <PrincessZoey> yeah she's power hungry. my macbook lasts 2 hours on battery in game lol
[05:44:53] <Hunterkll> of course, that's at 4K with max settings and the 4K texture pack added
[05:45:01] <Hunterkll> in HDR
[05:45:02] <Sousapro> Hunterkll: while playing all of those games?
[05:45:08] <Hunterkll> no i'm talking about FFXV
[05:45:10] <Hunterkll> just by itself
[05:45:18] <Hunterkll> it's almost as bad as fucking tom clancy ghost recon wildlands
[05:45:20] <Sousapro> Yeah it melts hardware lol
[05:45:24] <Hunterkll> my PC can't p lay that at max settings at all
[05:45:33] <Sousapro> I need to actually quit being lazy and install my 5950x
[05:45:35] <Hunterkll> Sousapro: it murders a single 1080 Ti, forcing it into SLI made it smooth as glass though 
[05:45:51] <Sousapro> My poor 2950x is not well suited to gaming lol
[05:45:52] <PrincessZoey> I was using a hand me down laptop from mikespears with a nvidia GT 940mx gpu
[05:46:02] <Hunterkll> but tom clancy ghost recon wildlands pushes my 1080 Ti's to max OC, max ram, and the menus lag. THE FUCKING MENUS. not even the game itself 
[05:46:09] <Sousapro> PrincessZoey: wow, that must have been a massive upgrade
[05:46:13] <Hunterkll> it's like watching a powerpoint 
[05:46:15] <Sousapro> Like life changing lol
[05:46:22] <Sousapro> Hunterkll: lol jesus
[05:46:25] <PrincessZoey> it was. double the ram, 4x the cores
[05:46:34] <Sousapro> They need to optimize that game Hunterkll 
[05:46:45] <Hunterkll> Sousapro: the graphics are insane though
[05:46:48] <Hunterkll> so i'm not sure what they could do 
[05:46:57] <PrincessZoey> the only thing I hate is that satisfactory will not run period on mac for some reason
[05:47:03] <Hunterkll> 2x 2080 Ti would probably suffice, and that's only a 30% jump per card - to get it to range 60fps anyway
[05:47:08] <Sousapro> Make it more reasonable in the menus?
[05:47:17] <Hunterkll> Sousapro: oh the actual gameplay past the menus is worse
[05:47:18] <Hunterkll> :D
[05:47:20] <PrincessZoey> a lot of games play fine on crossover including ffxiv, but not satisfactory
[05:47:27] <Sousapro> It took me a year to get my 3080
[05:47:38] <Sousapro> I should have resold my Radeon VII for more
[05:47:41] <Hunterkll> i was looking at two 3090's but with the timing ....
[05:47:51] <Sousapro> I just couldn't bring myself to sell it for more than MSRP
[05:47:56] <Hunterkll> almost on the edge of 4xxx series and intels next HEDT platform so 
[05:48:03] <Sousapro> Yeah
[05:48:23] <Hunterkll> i was gonna just slap in two 3090's and a i9-10980XE for a mild CPU upgrade but now...
[05:48:24] <Hunterkll> lol
[05:48:31] <PrincessZoey> I was debating getting a gaming laptop (desktop wasn't an option), or the macbook
[05:48:32] <Sousapro> I'm probably going to go 4090 or whatever if I can aquire one
[05:48:35] <PrincessZoey> said fuck it and got the macbook for school
[05:48:45] <Hunterkll> 10980XE would actually be a bit more than mild, some silicon fixes & soldered IHS with higher base freq

[05:52:16] <Hunterkll> PrincessZoey: ah, the 2002 fix that you refer to hasn't actually been deployed yet
[05:52:23] <Hunterkll> so the other tweak they made probably helped your area
[05:52:41] <Hunterkll> Although the code for fixing this bug is already prepared, applying the fix will require patching the game client, which will be addressed in Patch 6.01, scheduled for Tuesday, December 21. As this issue occurs while waiting in the queue for a very long time, we considered releasing the patch ahead of schedule, but in the end decided to include it in Patch 6.01, as there is already a lot of new code in the pipeline 
[05:52:41] <Hunterkll> for the patch and interrupting the process of verifying them may lead to other bugs. We apologize for the inconvenience and ask for your patience a bit longer.
[05:53:15] <PrincessZoey> can't wait for the new raid
[05:53:33] <Hunterkll> so yea, that dec 16th note/update didn't actually ship the fix that you thought it did :P

[07:26:44] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> AXFER is pretty standard
[07:27:13] <catbeard> @sysadmin so can you not just add ns1/ns2 to glue to your IP's and setup unbound with cloudflare as supermaster? so you can keep ns1/ns2 on your client domains
[07:27:30] <catbeard> cloudflare does offer this service, though it's not on their website, called vDNS
[07:28:24] <catbeard> they basically rent you an IP to point glue to
[07:28:48] <catbeard> and CF will pull from your existing authorative even if it's not pointed as authoritative
[07:29:08] <sd> 02<s‚Äãysadmin> wait
