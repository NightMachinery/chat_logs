[01:03:33] <spacekookie> leah2: oh thanks!
[01:26:24] <spacekookie> okay i'm confused again. I'm trying to replicate the example in the "Action Objects" section and a bit confused by the message I get https://paste.rs/siB The error: No such method 'made' for invocant of type 'Array'.   (in the TOP method)
[01:36:38] <moritz_> `$<statement>` is an array because <statement> is inside a quantifier
[01:37:21] <moritz_> so you'd need something like method TOP($/) { make $/<statement>.map: *.made }
[01:42:42] <spacekookie> hmmm

[07:42:58] <Voldenet> spacekookie: you're not far from the solution, you're only lacking `method keyword($/) { make ~$/ };` and `method payload($/) { make ~$/ }` in Actions
[07:43:46] <Voldenet> and $line<statement> is an array
[07:43:51] <Voldenet> this would work http://ix.io/3JIO

[18:06:54] <guifa> what's the license name to use if we're releasing code into the public domain?
[18:08:37] <moon-child> cc0, maybe
[18:13:55] <guifa> I can only find CC-PDDC in the spdx database which I guess works.  It just feels weird eneeding to say anything beyond "it's public domain"
[18:14:27] * guifa is releasing this module in public domain because the code it was based on was also in the public domain and it feels right to pass it along
[18:14:50] <moon-child> some jurisdictions don't recognise public domain; cc0 tries to make allowance for that
[18:15:08] <moon-child> in principle, if you say 'this is in the public domain', that should indicate to people that they can use your code for w/e they want and you won't sue them
[18:15:16] <moon-child> but some companies refuse to use such code because ... lawyers

[22:41:40] <El_Che> is there interest in linux arm64 rakudo packages? It would take considerable work because github actions does not support arm64 (besides a remote selfhosted runner). And there is not JIT for arm64

[23:47:39] <japhb> I'm more interested in the arm64 JIT support ... but I'm biased.  :-)
[23:48:52] <[Coke]> IANAL, but having worked with them on OSS issues for $DAYJOB, I find that the MIT license is pretty minimal (from my standpoint) and pretty unobjectionable (from theirs).
[23:53:05] <jast> here's my personal (and not lawyerized) overview for some of the more popular licenses: https://jan-krueger.net/doc/opensource-licenses.html
[23:56:07] <jast> in short, MIT is one of the more minimal licenses, with several others having a similar number of (but slightly different) restrictions
