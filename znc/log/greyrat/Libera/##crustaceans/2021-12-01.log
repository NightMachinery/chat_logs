[00:00:03] <edk> companion_cube: what was wrong with the handful of cases that needed it just using OrderedDict

[00:46:56] <edm> hereâ€™s a thing that i have resisted suggesting less anyone thinks me some american proud boy or something
[00:46:57] <edm> but
[00:47:36] <edm> youtube, netflix, prime etc - they presumably â€˜knowâ€™ that english is my native language, based on IP/credit card/viewing choice/whatever
[00:48:04] <edm> so how about when i ask for subtitle language they put â€˜englishâ€™ right at the top rather than making me scroll through 200 languages
[00:48:52] <edm> unless itâ€™s some conspiracy to increase awareness of aaaafrikaaans
[00:56:25] <indigo> Just make an "American" mode for Netflix
[00:56:33] <indigo> English-only, all international flags are replaced with US flag
[00:57:09] <edm> i am british
[00:57:14] <edm> i would hate that
[00:57:53] <edm> but still, i think putting your inferred primary language at the top of the list of subtitles/translations when watching a forein-language video wouldnâ€™t be unreasonable
[00:59:16] <indigo> I know, I was just being facetious as you mentioned proud boys ;) I do like that idea
[00:59:29] <indigo> I think Apple TV does that... or at least I always see English at the top
[00:59:54] <edm> it didnâ€™t just now
[01:00:08] <edm> trying to catch whatever belter-adjacent thing was being said in Foundationsd
[01:00:28] <edm> Foundations*
[01:00:40] <edm> the process run by foundationsd

[01:51:20] <buttsbot> How to remove "at a glance" date from home screen - Google Pixel Community
[01:51:22] <defect> wtf google?
[02:02:31] <dimadima> google
[02:02:44] <dimadima> google sucks
[02:06:49] <dimadima> google: dmitry sucks
[02:25:17] <indigo> What is an "at a glance date"
[02:27:01] <defect> it's just a thing showing the date on the home screen
[02:27:11] <defect> which you can't remove or even move around
[02:28:20] <indigo> That's fun
[02:28:20] <defect> but almost every clock widget shows the date as well, so it's very redundant and only in the way

[06:47:46] <Xe> indigo: what
[06:47:48] <Xe> that's so odd
[06:47:58] <Church> Hmm. I wonder how much of my neighbors stuff he let me have is stolen...
[06:48:07] <Church> Given we found out he's a car thief.
[06:50:19] <Xe> oh
[06:50:22] <Xe> fucking hell
[06:50:31] <Xe> of course it fails in light mode
[06:50:36] <Xe> time to learn CSS i guess
[06:50:43] <imode> Church: zoinks.
[06:51:03] <Xe> use dark mode in the system-wide settings panel as a stopgap? :x
[06:51:08] <imode> the police knockin' at your door?
[06:51:18] <Xe> guess what i test in lol
[06:51:18] <dimadima> Church: so that's what happened?
[07:00:56] <Church> imode: Not yet, got a call from him in Jail though which is how I knew he was alive.
[07:01:14] <Church> The car thief bit I learned from the landlady, purportedly she has friends on the force who told her.
[07:01:27] <Church> Not sure it's true but it would explain why he was always changing cars so often.
[07:01:33] <imode> why is it always the neighbors.
[07:01:49] <imode> like god damn I almost died because a psycho was flinging a gun around. a _neighbor_.
[07:02:05] <imode> why is it always the neighbors..
[07:02:59] <companion_cube> cause most people are someone else's neighbor
[07:03:01] <indigo> Xe: I use light mode everywhere, even in my editor and terminalâ€¦ Iâ€™m weird like that :D
[07:03:10] <companion_cube> unless they live in the forest or sth
[07:03:16] <companion_cube> indigo: same! â™¥
[07:04:14] <Xe> indigo: fair! I need to do more testing, i think i fucked something up with the snow theme
[07:06:43] <indigo> No worries! Dark mode and light mode is yet another piece on the complexity pile
[07:13:27] <Church> indigo: Least I got a TV, a PS4, Razer headset and a cat out of this neighbor
[07:13:31] <Church> So, could be worse
[07:26:45] <dimadima> and a cat!
[07:30:10] <indigo> Church: I think you meant imode
[07:30:53] <imode> we're always being confused, indigo.
[07:30:59] <indigo> Right??
[07:31:10] <imode> wanna swap bodies.
[07:31:25] <indigo> Sure
[07:31:48] <imode> you have now inherited a horrible tongue sore and cannot eat for 3 days.
[07:31:55] <indigo> Love it
[07:32:04] <indigo> Damn, AoC doesn't start for another hour
[07:32:20] <imode> I'd participate but I'm beat.
[07:38:26] <indigo> I usually participate until they give a problem that has something obscure, like the chinese remainder theorem
[07:39:26] <imode> yeah there's a plateau.
[07:42:49] <indigo> I had an interesting thought today: if you're writing a book you usually have an editor. But if you're writing code, other writers review/edit your code.
[07:43:42] <imode> that is a pretty neat split.. maybe we should bring back that split.
[07:44:25] <indigo> Then you might have to consider writing more than one draft :P
[07:44:53] <dimadima> here's a good example of both (a) the coin ppl having images w/ crazy eyes https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1458823702041223168 and (b) our crazy crypto future
[07:44:54] <buttsbot> Twitter - APompliano - Wow.  The City of Miami just announced they are going to give a Bitcoin dividend to every citizen that sets up a digital wal...

[17:43:57] <riv> hehe
[17:44:49] <dimadima> i thought it was because she really, really, really cares about people and the future of the united states of america
[17:55:05] <gwozniak> martian67|: love that fact

[17:58:12] <gwozniak> I just don't have the time :(
[18:01:39] <gthm> :(
[18:03:20] <gwozniak> I tried to do AoC a 3 or 4 years ago and I had to give up after about 20 days as it became a drain
[18:04:07] <Brekkjern> I did like 2-3 days or something. The problems were just too convoluted to be fun to explore IMO
[18:07:58] <riv> 20 days? wow
[18:08:04] <riv> ive only ever done 3 days
[18:08:37] <companion_cube> same, more or less
[18:11:59] <gerikson> this when I go all hard-ass coach: NEVER GIVE UP
[18:15:28] <companion_cube> it's not really interesting enough tbh
[18:15:53] <companion_cube> maybe if you use a high level language it's easier to half ass each day? idk
[18:16:23] <Brekkjern> Not really. It's still fucky to deal with.
[18:17:00] <gerikson> I have no kids, no cats, no side hustle, and my job is chill and boring
[18:17:06] <gerikson> AoC is perfect for me
[18:17:12] <companion_cube> :D right
[18:17:52] <Brekkjern> I think I'd rather prefer to use my time on some personal coding projects
[18:19:33] <gerikson> I'd expect you to spend it noodling w/ your SO and/or playing vidjagames
[18:20:15] <companion_cube> the free time where you have motivation to code, say
[18:20:47] <riv> giving up is good actually
[18:21:18] <edm> i have never found the problems _convoluted_, i think 90% of the battle (based on doing it last year and yr before) is realising where he's trying to hide the obvious simplicity in all the prose
[18:21:43] <edm> usually you do it naively and then realise it's a 3-liner because it's a much simplier problem than you first realised
[18:21:52] <edm> and then you start looking for the simple problem from then on
[18:22:15] <edm> having said all that, i suppose some of it can be a bit tedious. probably not doing it this year as i'm in the mega-throes of a work project
[18:25:02] <dimadima> gerikson: nice
[18:25:15] <dimadima> that's the good life
[18:25:34] <Brekkjern> gerikson: I'm probably gonna spend my time chilling, reading for my next exam, and watching Arcane again :P
[18:28:09] <defect> arcane was a real nice surprise
[18:28:22] <Brekkjern> "nice" is not the word I'd use
[18:28:35] <Brekkjern> But yeah, it's amazing
[18:28:37] <companion_cube> that the new netflix anime?
[18:28:47] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[18:29:01] <Brekkjern> I cannot recommend it enough, but it is a tragic story
[18:29:54] <Brekkjern> Give it the first 3 episodes. If you don't find it interesting by then I don't know what would.
[18:30:10] <companion_cube> hmm
[18:30:11] <defect> beautiful animation and great voice acting
[18:30:24] <Brekkjern> Also, there's a time skip between episode 3 and 4 (very obvious) and episode 4 gives you a bit of an emotional rest
[18:30:44] <Brekkjern> If you need a clip to convince you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy5NYUgNqvs
[18:30:45] <buttsbot> CRYING AND SCREAMING POWDER - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy5NYUgNqvs
[18:31:02] <companion_cube> hop, in my list
[18:31:30] <companion_cube> that's nice animation, is that cell shading?
[18:31:46] <Brekkjern> I'm not sure
[18:31:51] <Brekkjern> But the animation is nuts
[18:32:15] <Brekkjern> I'm on my second rewatch and I found the series on friday
[18:32:31] <companion_cube> :D
[18:32:45] <Brekkjern> It's just absurdly good. It's number 14 of top TV series on IMDB, and 100% tomatometer and 98% audience score
[18:32:57] <Brekkjern> 9.3 IMDB score
[18:33:41] <Brekkjern> It's wildly good, and it's ridiculous that a game franchise would spawn such a series
[18:34:43] <companion_cube> what game is that from? is there a Arcane game?
[18:34:50] <Brekkjern> League of Legends
[18:34:54] <companion_cube> :o
[18:34:56] <companion_cube> wtf
[18:34:58] <Brekkjern> Yep
[18:35:11] <companion_cube> at least with Castlevania I could see how
[18:35:16] <Brekkjern> Exactly :P
[18:35:59] <Brekkjern> I have zero interest in League and I just gave it a chance because of the animation quality
[18:36:08] <defect> same
[18:36:21] <Brekkjern> But this is legit some of the best TV I have ever watched in my life
[18:36:28] <defect> was a bit discourage to check arcane out because i've never played league and don't intend to
[18:36:46] <defect> and a show based on a game sounded pretty dumb
[18:37:15] <defect> glad i did though
[18:37:26] <Brekkjern> https://i.redd.it/diro4js243281.gif
[18:37:35] <Brekkjern> That tiny clip there made me watch it
[18:37:54] <Brekkjern> And I both regret it and don't.

[20:44:13] <Church> Xe: New site?

[20:44:31] <Xe> i have snow CSS that shows up during winter

[20:58:50] <imode> riv: tuuuuuuuuuuuuuuples.
[21:01:22] <riv> love em
[21:02:25] <imode> they're deceptively simple if you want to construct different data structures in the space, though.
[21:02:32] <imode> you need to agree with everyone else on the uniqueness of a name.
[21:02:37] <imode> for example, to build a linked list.
[21:03:59] <Church> Xe: Ah right. Forgot about this.
[21:12:22] <riv> hmm... scope..
[21:26:59] <dimadima> ugh
[21:31:53] <pja> Xe: are you going to move your website to "Xe" as well?
[21:37:20] <Xe> pja: the domain "christine.website" has such insane SEO that I don't want to bother messing it up
[21:37:53] <pja> Fair. I think there is magic you can do to preserve the SEO juice, but the cost of messing it up is high, so...
[21:38:42] <Xe> yeah but tbh that's too much effort lol
[21:43:13] <pja> Todayâ€™s fâ€™up: I see the latest HP exploit clusterf*ck & decide to at least put an admin password on the Laserjet & block all the directly exploitable ports. Now my printer refuses to recognise the admin password I just set, even though I pasted from the same copy into both the password setting dialog & the login dialog.
[21:43:16] <pja> Thanks HP.
[21:43:30] <pja> (I can reset the thing from the console, but still. Ugh.)
[21:44:06] <pja> (Naturally my printer is too old for HP to actually bother patching. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever bought a new printer...)
[21:57:14] <dimadima> what tests the tests?
[22:08:20] <dimadima> is it the code?
