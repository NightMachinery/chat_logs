[01:35:16] <jacobk> How do we deal with web pages (and people) that use "free software" to mean to zero-cost software? Like this article for example: https://www.lifewire.com/free-backup-software-tools-2617964
[01:35:16] <jacobk> With "open source", we can say "you're using the phrase wrong", but since "free" has 2 valid meanings, I don't see an obvious path for making the usage of the word less confusing.

[01:54:06] <vertbyqb[m]> jacobk: We can either clarify or use a different term, like libre or freedom software.
[01:54:34] <isf> nothing in the life is free
[01:54:38] <isf> as in price
[01:54:40] <isf> never
[01:54:59] <isf> nothing, all have a cost, so always free is are in freedom
[01:55:54] <isf> the gifts, are voluntary giving, but that dont mean that is without cost or price. Becouse someone must pay for it.
[01:56:22] <jacobk> It's practically free (gratis) to reproduce existing software
[01:57:30] <jacobk> vertbyqb[m]: Us clarifying or using a different term doesn't make the web page less confusing though, IMO.
[01:58:27] <jacobk> Maybe it would be better to abandon the term free and switch to libre though. But for some reason that seems like a bad idea.

[03:35:35] <isf> in real, for example Trisquel they say they distribute trisquel without price

[07:33:58] <jacobk> Unless you're referring to the operating system lol but then I'm even more confused
[07:35:00] <Andrew> That's a proper Chinese character, but often used as an emote.  I'm saying that what hongkongliberato said doesn't help, will get him arrested if he's really in Hong Kong, and generally doesn't give us anything more than what we already know
[07:38:50] <jacobk> Oh okay thanks for the explanation
[07:41:19] <Andrew> 囧 is one of the most cursed Chinese characters around

[07:48:22] <jacobk> https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/%E5%9B%A7 says it can mean a lot when used as an emoticon but is rarely used in the context of its original meaning, but then how would you say "window" in Chinese today?

[07:52:25] <DiffieHellman> Seems to mean something similar to "bright" now.

[11:23:38] <Andrew> theoretically he does
[11:23:41] <Andrew> practically no
[11:23:51] <Andrew> idk if he uses smtp

[11:24:37] <littlebobeep> Andrew: okay SMTP is email right?
[11:25:16] <vertbyqb[m]> yeah, i think smtp is the core of sending email
[11:25:17] <Andrew> littlebobeep: gnu.org's email server definitely uses smtp
[11:25:27] <Andrew> the s2s is obviously smtp
[11:25:37] <Andrew> But he might use another way to talk to gnu.org'a email server

[13:46:01] <labrador> idk riseup?
[13:48:02] <TheLinuxNerd> are any of them reliable?
[13:49:01] <labrador> riseup is pretty reliable
[13:49:32] <TheLinuxNerd> I don't seek free (gratis), I seek free as in liberated.
[13:49:47] <TheLinuxNerd> I'm fine paying for it
[13:50:29] <labrador> TheLinuxNerd, idk what about cock.li
[13:50:30] <labrador> hahahaha
[13:50:47] <Andrew> TheLinuxNerd: Make. Your. Own.
[13:51:05] <TheLinuxNerd> Andrew, I suppose that's an option
[13:51:12] <labrador> TheLinuxNerd, don't
[13:51:21] <TheLinuxNerd> yeah, I could get my server, get another droplet, have 2 MX servers with DKIM and DMARC
[13:51:21] <labrador> Unless ur prepared to make it a part time job
[13:51:22] <Andrew> why
[13:51:30] <Andrew> labrador: it's easy
[13:51:42] <Andrew> https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/emailwiz
[13:51:50] <TheLinuxNerd> labrador, and I don't even need to get hacked, I can do it myself :-D
[13:52:12] <labrador> Andrew, it isn't easy when it breaks down
[13:52:17] <labrador> Email is hard to maintain
[13:52:24] <TheLinuxNerd> so, I want a riseup, but I can use own domain, right?
[13:52:50] <labrador> yeah custom domains are supported but not so fast m8
[13:52:54] <labrador> You need an invite
[13:53:10] <TheLinuxNerd> labrador, yep
[13:53:17] <TheLinuxNerd> can I please have one :-)
[13:53:20] <TheLinuxNerd> pretty please
[13:53:26] <Andrew> labrador: How can it break down???
[13:53:39] <Andrew> TheLinuxNerd: WAIT
[13:53:42] <labrador> TheLinuxNerd, I would give you one if I could
[13:53:46] <Andrew> TheLinuxNerd: YOU'RE GOOD FOR AUTISTICI
[13:53:51] <labrador> My account is too young
[13:53:56] <labrador> You can ask GNUhacker
[13:54:47] <TheLinuxNerd> yeah autistici ... I'm not sure I wanna tell people my email is ......@autistici.org :-D 
[13:54:58] <Andrew> ?
[13:55:09] <labrador> TheLinuxNerd, true
[13:55:19] <labrador> Like I don't wanna tell people my email is @cock.li
[13:55:19] <TheLinuxNerd> quite simple, autisticii with ii in Romanian means "autism sufferers"
[13:55:23] <Andrew> TheLinuxNerd: you already have one?
[13:55:48] <TheLinuxNerd> and it would be like "hey world, I'm autistic!"
[13:55:57] <TheLinuxNerd> i am, but I do not want to promote it :-D
[13:55:57] <labrador> ^
[13:56:11] <labrador> ALso TheLinuxNerd 
[13:56:20] <labrador> Look at the ToCs of these services too
[13:56:32] <labrador> Autistici has a fuck ton of donts
[13:56:38] <labrador> Riseup doesn't have as many
[13:57:03] <Andrew> labrador: but autistici is socialist

[13:58:29] <TheLinuxNerd> really, no SLA?
[13:58:35] <Andrew> TheLinuxNerd: As is without any warrenty is normal
[13:58:57] <Andrew> lol
[13:59:04] <TheLinuxNerd> https://workspace.google.com/terms/sla.html
[14:00:01] <TheLinuxNerd> I'll be clearer, I'd like a service that respects my freedom, that is *paid-for*, an that will guarantee 99% uptime a month & not lose my precious emails :-D
[14:00:15] <TheLinuxNerd> and where I can use my custom domain
[14:00:37] <DiffieHellman> I suggest you host your own mailserver then,.
[14:00:49] <Andrew> hosting postfix or opensmtpd, very easy
[14:01:00] <TheLinuxNerd> that is what I have done in the past
[14:01:03] <TheLinuxNerd> postfix & dovecot
[14:01:08] <DiffieHellman> With librebooted hardware. I don't now of anyone who hosts mail on non-backdoored computing hardware.
[14:01:52] <Andrew> TheLinuxNerd: very easy
[14:02:18] <labrador> TheLinuxNerd, what about tutanota or pm
[14:02:30] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: I still have to use a SaaSS VPS because of stupid isps in china
[14:02:32] <TheLinuxNerd> I was at tutanota, that is just relay service, I think
[14:02:39] <labrador> no
[14:02:44] <Andrew> s/stupid/silly/
[14:02:57] <TheLinuxNerd> I don't recall why I left .... oh wait, yeah, now it's coming back
[14:03:02] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: Well yeah, such a huge country and almost all are IPv4.
[14:03:09] <TheLinuxNerd> they probably have DMARC quarantine and I don't get my ISPs bill!
[14:03:12] <TheLinuxNerd> :-D LOL
[14:03:50] <labrador> yeah man you gotta make ur own service 
[14:04:07] <TheLinuxNerd> so I got a server on digitalocean
[14:04:12] <labrador> tho have fun getting above 97% uptime
[14:04:51] <TheLinuxNerd> idk, maybe I should just focus on leaving google first.
[14:05:05] <TheLinuxNerd> Google costs me 6$/month
[14:05:07] <DiffieHellman> Yes, do that as soon as you can.
[14:05:22] <DiffieHellman> Stop giving em more money.
[14:05:32] <labrador> TheLinuxNerd, you wont ever get googles quality/price
[14:05:44] <labrador> economies of scale yo
[14:05:58] <TheLinuxNerd> yeah Google is huge, thousands of servers, thousands of backups
[14:06:09] <labrador> heck their servers are custom made
[14:06:31] <DiffieHellman> Well yeah, otherwise you get scammed on the price of servers.
[14:06:32] <TheLinuxNerd> there was this Mac Mini rent company that had custom racks made to fit Mac Minis
[14:06:39] <TheLinuxNerd> in huge towers :-D
[14:06:58] <TheLinuxNerd> (for people making iOS apps, that did not want to buy apple shit)
[14:07:02] <DiffieHellman> How is that a happy thing? Those mac minis ran nonfree software.
[14:07:14] <TheLinuxNerd> no it isn't happy, is funny
[14:07:24] <TheLinuxNerd> pathetic.
[14:07:25] <labrador> hes just sharing DiffieHellman 
[14:07:28] <DiffieHellman> That's even worse - specifically writing proprietary malware with such racks
[14:07:29] <labrador> calm down
[14:07:33] <labrador> calm down
[14:07:34] <DiffieHellman> I am calm.
[14:07:48] <TheLinuxNerd> DiffieHellman, I used to have a mac mini in my house
[14:07:49] <DiffieHellman> I'm sure you'd love it when I'm actually angry.
[14:08:05] <Andrew> My dmarc works
[14:08:10] <TheLinuxNerd> it's less worse than Windows :-D
[14:08:23] <TheLinuxNerd> I wish I could turn off noreply-dmarc-support via Webmaster
[14:08:26] * DiffieHellman breathes deeply.
[14:08:37] <labrador> isnt less worse
[14:08:41] <labrador> just better?
[14:08:44] <labrador> lol

[14:10:16] <TheLinuxNerd> I play a lot of Animal Crossing

[14:11:03] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: OpenBSD >  that, for practical freedom 1
[14:11:05] <TheLinuxNerd> but I wish I could run whatever software I wanted on it
[14:11:19] <labrador> TheLinuxNerd, uh chip mods?
[14:11:22] <labrador> homebrew?
[14:11:29] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: Yes, OpenBSD and GNU/GNU Linux-libre are on the left as both are free software.
[14:11:31] <TheLinuxNerd> labrador, chip mods would void my extended warranty
[14:11:42] <labrador> idc about warranty
[14:12:12] <TheLinuxNerd> I care, I get 2 years of manufacturer + 2 years extended = 4 years if it breaks it gets repaired/replaced
[14:12:49] <DiffieHellman> Ninty is slightly worse than m$, as their switch is a tyrant and refuses to boot repalcement or even modified OS's, but m$ is guilty of the same thing with those windows ARM tablets.
[14:12:50] <labrador> idk man making it free matters more to me

[14:13:19] <labrador> i also save on game costs >:3
[14:13:34] <TheLinuxNerd> DiffieHellman, I think M$ is worse than them all, cause they look through your computer.

[14:17:17] <Andrew> labrador: sorry but that's just because Linux is popular

[14:17:38] <TheLinuxNerd> and I game on the Nintendo. And use OBS FOSS and an ASUS TUF CU4K30 (that works in Linux to capture the video) and stream to youtube

[15:25:46] <TheLinuxNerd> lol
[15:26:21] <DiffieHellman> It is correct that m$ has put them in a position where pretty much every prebuilt computer or laptop comes with windows, but when it comes to actually getting work done, windows is pretty bad at that. 
[15:26:41] <DiffieHellman> Windows does _not_ run on any computers that actually matter, as it's not reliable enough for such tasks.
[15:27:21] <TheLinuxNerd> honestly, I'd rather have non-free Linux than non-free WIndows
[15:27:33] <kompowiec2[x]> Iirc red hat have contract with lenovo and pre installed fedora
[15:27:41] <DiffieHellman> The most commonly used OS is probably MINIX, since intel has shipped hugs numbers of processors with their backdoor.
[15:28:06] <DiffieHellman> kompowiec2[x]: Sure, but if you walk into a store here, you won't see it on any of the laptops.

[21:24:02] <corwin> free software takes an ethical position and FSF defines our goals in terms of that ethical position.  open source is an intentional watering down of that ethical stance into technical criteria, at best.  to confuse the two is at least foolish.
