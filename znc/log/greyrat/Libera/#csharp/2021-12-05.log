[01:06:05] <MatthiasVance> Just browse the tree once in your project under Dependencies
[01:06:18] <MatthiasVance> The API one is that you are not following conventions (that you can specify)

[01:34:16] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: You can already enforce returning certain statuses

[06:58:08] <Andrio> the range of valid ints is -2147483648 to -2147483647, so -int.MinValue doesn't fit.

[06:58:49] <Andrio> rather, +2147483647

[14:07:14] <Slade> yea. thats what i always suspected

[14:08:57] <blez> and there's something interesting. In a lot of people, the antibodies do down and then up again
[14:13:17] <Rudde> Andrio: I assume it is like this because there is no negative 0 value in int. and all 0's expect the sign is considered -1?
[14:13:47] <Slade> blez, did you see a bau/ml table somewhere?

[14:36:51] <moose> What do you think I assumed?
[14:37:20] <Slade> oh right. i forget you suffer from 386, my apologies.
[14:37:46] <moose> The fuck are you on about?
[14:37:48] <Slade> https://xkcd.com/386/
[14:37:59] <moose> Funny.
[14:38:01] <Slade> its a crappy mental disorder
[14:38:12] <moose> No, I think you're unable to defend your position now after being a dick.
[14:38:33] <moose> Just because you know that it's retarded to let an antibody concentration dictate what precautions someone takes, you get all uppity now.
[14:38:56] <moose> And you assume that my comment is absolutely directly related to what you are talking about.
[14:38:57] <Slade> we werent discussing precautions someone should take
[14:39:10] <moose> It was briefly mentioned but I do know that's not the entire conversation.
[14:39:43] <Slade> it was mentioned that someone not in the conversation wasnt wearing a mask, but certainly wasnt using that number to decide their decision
[14:39:54] <moose> My core point, if you took the time to understand someone else's perspective for once, is that just because someone doesn't get sick when not wearing a mask and their antibody concentration is at a given level, doesn't prove that antibody concentration is equal to a certain protection factor.
[14:40:05] <Slade> you might as well have told us to stop choosing our mask wearing based upon our favorite ice cream flavor
[14:40:23] <moose> I was mostly commenting for everyone else in the channel who may think your misinformation sounds scientific.
[14:40:26] <Slade> anyhow. this is a dumb conversation, and you're going to badger with your 386 infection until you prove some minor point, so i'm just bailing
[14:40:32] <moose> Unfortunately, there's quite a lot of shit data out there from people like you pushing out nonsense
[14:41:21] <moose> Yes my point about actual facts is definitely irrelevant in a discussion about the active pandemic with more misinformation problems than any other scientific topic in the history of humanity.
[14:41:38] <moose> I have no clue how you are off of my ignore list you twat.
[14:42:23] <Slade> mission accomplished. goodnight
[14:43:18] <MaNa2k> so i want to RemoveAll items that have a certain value in a dictionary, but it seems like its not implemented in a dicitonary list
[14:43:34] <MaNa2k> ah, does it have something to do with that theres no dupes in dictionary ?
[14:43:51] <Slade> MaNa2k, what would removeall do on a Dictionary
[14:44:26] <MaNa2k> was thinking something same that happens in a List<>
[14:44:32] <MaNa2k> was converting from list to dictionary
[14:44:36] <Slade> elaborate
[14:44:37] <moose> Consider just selecting the things that match what you want instead with .Where
[14:44:43] <MaNa2k> and realized that removeall wasnt available in dictionary
[14:44:59] <Slade> you want it to scan the values of the dictionary?
[14:44:59] <MaNa2k> but i think i understand now why its not available, its because dictionaries cant hold dupes anyhow
[14:45:10] <Slade> they cant have dupe keys
[14:45:14] <Slade> but can values
[14:45:16] <moose> But RemoveAll can have a predicate that doesn't match only one key.
[14:45:26] <MaNa2k> Slade, oh, can i have dupe values ?
[14:45:38] <MaNa2k> hmm
[14:45:59] <MaNa2k> oh ofc i can, wheres my head, its the key part thats no dupe
[14:46:12] <Slade> MaNa2k, of course.    awards["best_programmer"] = MaNa2k   awards["coolest_hair"] = MaNa2k
[14:46:59] <MaNa2k> so basically what i want to do is, scan all key and remove the dupe values in that dictionary
[14:47:52] <MaNa2k> maybe i can just do a groupby
[14:48:17] <moose> You could just enumerate the dictionary and compose a list of keys that contain duplicate values and then call dict.Remove to get rid of them.
[14:48:41] <Slade> MaNa2k, how would you know which one to keep
[14:49:04] <Slade>   awards["best_programmer"] = MaNa2k   awards["coolest_hair"] = MaNa2k    <-- which one gets deleted
[14:49:04] <moose> To efficiently check if a value is duplicated, you can use a HashSet<T> for that and check if the HashSet.Add method returns true/false.
[14:49:24] <MaNa2k> i want the one with the biggest value in a sertain property, ill just do a Max or something
[14:49:42] <MaNa2k> hmm
[14:49:45] <moose> I thought you just said you wanted to remove the dupes
[14:49:50] <Slade> MaNa2k, then its not a duplicate is it?
[14:50:08] <Slade> MaNa2k, i think you're down in the weeds, and should step back
[14:50:09] <MaNa2k> Slade, its actyarll a dict<int, myobj>
[14:50:19] <MaNa2k> where myobj has a property which can be dupe
[14:50:22] <MaNa2k> which i want to test on
[14:50:40] <Slade> MaNa2k, so its not really duplicates, but its a property inside the object you want to filter by
[14:50:52] <MaNa2k> and remove if dupe, and keep the object which has the biggest different property numb
[14:50:59] <MaNa2k> yes
[14:51:58] <MaNa2k> but i think i know how to do this know, ill just groupby on propertyA select all where Max(propertyB) or something
[14:52:09] <MaNa2k> *now
[14:55:43] <Slade> you should probably do this before you dict it. groupby isnt unreasonable.. or just check before adding
[14:56:54] <MaNa2k> lol dict it

[23:39:12] <_Shurik_> no?
[23:39:15] <_Shurik_> hmm
[23:39:29] <Suchiman> since if you pass in a list, then T is List<X> and asking if it's IEnumerable<T> then is the same as asking if it's IEnumerable<List<X>>
