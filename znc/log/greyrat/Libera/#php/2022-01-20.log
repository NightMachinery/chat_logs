[00:00:58] <biberu> jhave: don't know if you'd typically run into issues with php projects, but i'd focus on getting an easy workflow first
[00:01:31] <biberu> jhave: that'd probably mean just share it from the host and see if it works for you
[00:02:00] <relipse> i have 3 file uploads, but all 3 are optional, how do I check to see if an image was selected (and uploaded)
[00:02:31] <__adrian> do you mean, one of those 3 uploads?
[00:02:47] <relipse> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/5xx9dAYD/
[00:03:01] <relipse> i tried that but it seems to be set no matter what if there was an image selectged in there
[00:03:15] <__adrian> check each in turn. if you haven't found any by the time you're done, then nothing was uploaded
[00:03:49] <biberu> jhave: hypothetically you can also do hybrid solutions, e.g. if you have a huge node_modules folder you could keep that on a volume while sharing your own code as usual
[00:03:52] <__adrian> are you trying to validate that something was uploaded, or that the uploaded thing is an image?
[00:04:24] <relipse> that something was uploaded
[00:04:33] <__adrian> then see above
[00:04:35] <relipse> if nothing was uploaded i want to skip the checks
[00:04:46] <__adrian> loop, if you found nothing by the end then nothing was uploaded
[00:04:53] <relipse> loop what?
[00:04:59] <__adrian> your input names
[00:05:00] <relipse> look at my code i am looping

[01:25:04] <goddard> like render it statically
[01:25:33] <__adrian> does the php code only do static stuff?
[01:25:44] <goddard> gonna put it in an email
[01:25:51] <goddard> and i didn't want to completely redo the entire thing
[01:26:25] <__adrian> javascript isn't going to work in your email
[01:26:32] <goddard> right
[01:26:58] <Albright> goddard: Load the page, let the JS do its thing, then open the dev tools, select the HTML element, and "Copy HTML" from the contextual menu?
[01:27:00] <goddard> php web renderer and capture a snap shot or something
[01:27:07] <da_wunder> so add just option for that function/method that renders your html if it should  or not include that javascript or not
[01:27:51] <__adrian> yeah, if you want the js to do something to the page, then you're going to have to let it run and then copy the resultant html
[01:27:52] <goddard> i guess it would need to basically be selenium and taking a picture of a region or something haha
[01:28:04] <__adrian> this really doesn't sound better than writing a new email template

[01:29:07] <__adrian> it's not just "well practical"

[01:29:15] <da_wunder> that is basically the only valid solution
[01:29:29] <__adrian> html for an email is basically nothing like html for a webpage.
[01:29:38] <da_wunder> ^
[01:29:45] <Albright> Wait
[01:29:49] <Albright> I just had a crazy idea
[01:30:20] <Albright> What if you just sent a plain-text email? That way it would be visible the same way for everybody and you wouldn't have to concern yourself with client rendering differences.
[01:30:24] <da_wunder> use headless chrome and take a screenshot of that page, and use that in email?
[01:30:45] <da_wunder> and that was just a troll
[01:30:51] <Albright> If only email clients supported plain text
[01:31:21] <__adrian> "If only email clients supported plain text"  i don't know if you meant that ironically, but ironically, it's not ironic
[01:31:21] <da_wunder> personally I always prefer to use plain text format in emails - because that is supported with all email clients
[01:31:52] <Albright> I am being sarcastic, yes. Plain text is ideal when possible.
[01:32:06] <Albright> Unfortunately clients (as in the people that pay me) don't always agree.
[01:32:19] <__adrian> i had a four-month argument with our sec team over whether the fact that most email clients turn plain text urls into links was a security flaw in our code
[01:32:55] <Albright> What did they propose? Not including URLs in your emails?
[01:32:59] <__adrian> yes
[01:33:12] <da_wunder> then you need to tell them that will cost X and it isn't so easy to implement and test - and still you would have some errors on some clients

[03:28:29] <ramblebamble> PenguinMan98, vagrant is dead simple, either provision it with shell-scripts or s.th. like ansible, if you are familiar with it
[03:29:02] <ramblebamble> it is basically a frontend that allows you to handle various virtual environments, be they container or VMs

[03:29:48] <__adrian> local
[03:29:54] <ramblebamble> PenguinMan98, those are nice, but than your IDE will have to be in the cloude as well, otherwise you will have to mount your code upstream, which is not nice, and you will have to be always online

[03:31:18] <PenguinMan98> It would be nice to have the option
[03:32:16] <ramblebamble> yes, and using s.th. like Oracle VirtualBox you do not have to worry about permissions, nothing is more unnerving than juggling permissions because the user inside a container is always root -.-

[03:35:44] <__adrian> a container probably wouldn't help all that much here. a VM might, but i don't know how well that would be supported with an m1

[03:36:28] <__adrian> but does it run x86 vms?
[03:36:34] <Albright> It emulates them, yes.
[03:36:48] <__adrian> he's not making a dev env  ;)  he's trying to dev on his desktop OS

[03:38:00] <noord> Albright: creating vm's are easier than fixing apple problmes
[03:38:14] <Albright> noord: No fixes are necessary. It's a Unix platform.
[03:38:17] <__adrian> noord: sometimes, for some people.
[03:38:42] <__adrian> victor: why do you think that?
[03:39:02] <victor> __adrian: I verify from the panel
[03:39:08] <Albright> victor: Try var_dumping $ref_codes and making sure that part worked. If your line breaks are weird that might not work.

[05:14:44] <[Syntax]> it only happens when page is loaded with www before the domain, on another site it blocks other file links when the page is loaded on http and not https
[05:15:18] <[Syntax]> it appears to be some kind of cross-site scripting protection, but http/https www.domain.com/domain.com seems to be triggering it
[05:15:28] <__adrian> because, exactly what it says
[05:15:46] <__adrian> there's no Access-Control-Allow-Origin header so it won't work cross-domain
[05:15:53] <__adrian> (www. is a different domain)
[05:16:15] <__adrian> are these your sites?
[05:16:23] <[Syntax]> I havent found any instructions on how to fix it.. and it hasnt been an issue until recently..

[16:50:08] <__adrian> the most serious problem i see here is the potential for code execution. you're taking user input, escaping it in a very naieve way, and then passing it to a shell.
[16:50:09] <Error> and found a shell script to create the web archive for it
[16:50:18] <__adrian> you're searching the contents of the messages, yes?

[16:54:10] <__adrian> don't try to roll your own escaping.
[16:54:42] <__adrian> it would be _very_ preferable (ntm more performant) to use a tool like elasticsearch. then you could pass user input with less risk.
[16:55:09] <__adrian> or even a regular database (not ideal, but would make things simpler/safer).
[16:55:36] <__adrian> did you understand Naktibalda's question earlier? about how pagination is pointless in this case?

[16:55:59] <Error> nah i replied to it! as well
[16:56:06] <Error> it just went over my head tbh!
[16:56:36] <__adrian> so why is it "better" to have pagination - what does pagination solve?
[16:57:10] <Error> just an option in my head really!
[16:57:48] <__adrian> pagination is for splitting up work into more manageable chunks
[16:58:12] <__adrian> e.g., if you have thousands of emails to search, you can search ony 15 or so at a time.
[16:58:27] <__adrian> but in your code, you're searching _everything_, every time, no matter what.
[16:58:37] <Error> i do understand that bit
[16:58:41] <__adrian> in this case, all pagination does is throw away most of that work, every time.
[16:58:49] <Error> yes thats the other bit i need too look into

[16:59:37] <__adrian> you should also split up your work on this project  ;)  you're doing many things. you should work on each individually.
[17:00:17] <__adrian> the part to focus on first is your search functionality. even if you stick with exec(), you need a better way to do it.
[17:00:51] <__adrian> learn about escapeshellarg and escapeshellcmd.
[17:00:54] <Error> i was reading awk or sed not sure i could have any success with them comands
[17:01:18] <__adrian> that part is not part of your php script, but it does need to be done before you can write the php part.
[17:01:24] <Error> first runing a shell comand in openBSD was almost kind a making a rocket

[17:02:24] <__adrian> yes?

[17:08:27] <Error> then pagination ?
[17:08:36] <__adrian> that's the thing you need to build everything else on top of
[17:08:46] <Error> ah cools!

[17:12:28] <__adrian> even if you use a cli tool, (decide on the tool first, and) write the parts of your code that interact with it very carefully. use the functions i mentioned above, OR (even better) use an existing library that is well-reviewed and maintained. you canlook on packagist.org for php libraries.
[17:12:39] <__adrian> last advice: php.net (this is the official manual). iterate arrays using foreach(), NOT while() or for(). and ask when you need help understanding something.
[17:12:50] <__adrian> i'm off, but others here can help also. have fun!

[22:24:28] <__adrian> recommend /join #wordpress
[22:24:41] <relipse> they don't know what I'm asking
[22:26:10] <__adrian> then why would we?
[22:26:26] <relipse> maybe #php is smarter?
[22:27:16] <__adrian> if you can ask this question without wordpress, then please explain - otherwise, it's a #wordpress question and you'll need to figure out how to clarify for them
[22:27:46] <__adrian> as-is, it sounds like you're trying to solve something but you've chosen the wrong idea
[22:28:11] <__adrian> with any CMS, you generally don't _actually_ create new directories/php scripts in order to make new pages
[22:28:27] <__adrian> the CMS will have some admin tool to do so
[22:28:39] <relipse> that's how I'll have a best access and control
[22:29:01] <relipse> i just want like <?php wp_header(); ?><my page contents><?php wp_footer(); ?>
[22:29:29] <__adrian> willing to bet wp has a way of doing that.
[22:29:44] <__adrian> kinda sounds like what it normally does.
[22:30:06] <__adrian> but it's definitely a #wordpress question.
