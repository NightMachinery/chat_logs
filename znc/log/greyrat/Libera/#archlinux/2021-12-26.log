[06:02:39] <thurstylark> bobsy: eh, unless you're using pipewire-jack instead of jack proper, I'm probably not gonna be much help
[06:02:52] <bobsy> im using pipewire-jack, yes
[06:03:17] <thurstylark> what's your source?
[06:03:25] <bobsy> sound source?
[06:03:31] <kenwoodfox> Alright~ changes made ;3 lets see if this works, brb thurstylark
[06:03:54] <thurstylark> bobsy: yeah, which app, or what kind of device?
[06:04:22] <bobsy> asterisk JACK(), i call extension from a sip phone
[06:04:43] <thurstylark> oh right, you said that :P mb
[06:04:51] <Betal> bobsy: about linux-rt, sheep already told you "linux-rt shouldn't have any issues with drives that non-rt kernels didn't have", I wonder if still same problem
[06:05:12] <bobsy> Betal: that was in regards to a faulty hard disk drive.
[06:05:41] <bobsy> i had to get a new hdd and start again
[06:05:51] <bobsy> because the kernel wouldn't compile/install
[06:06:11] <bobsy> the disk kept going into read-only mode during the build/isntall process
[06:06:25] <kenwoodfox> thurstylark: looks like the sound is still there :.
[06:06:30] <kenwoodfox> did a quick reboot

[06:14:48] <Betal> bobsy: if you can't find a solution, try to ask in #pipewire on oftc

[06:15:36] *** Joins: xoan2 (~xoan@user/xoan)
[06:16:03] <thurstylark> kenwoodfox: nice. So, the hacky answer for making that automagical is to `aplay /dev/zero` for a little bit in a systemd --user service that has Requires=pipewire.socket (or similar)... There might be a way to get pipewire to take a card out of suspend right away, but haven't found one yet...
[06:16:29] <kenwoodfox> thurstylark: thanks so much for the help~

You can check that with something like:  `cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sdXY`.  You don't need to tell grub to try again:  when you enter an incorrect passphrase, you will see 'No key available with this passphrase.'  Careful passphrase typing is mandatory :D

[09:51:22] <birkoff> hi i have a problem in linux that doesn't happen on windows. my monitors shows no video signal when trying to resume work after more than an hour or so of blanking out due to inactivity. if I had vlc playing something it would keep playing but network services of the machine would not be accessible on the local network. no mouse, keyboard press or ctrl+alt+f? elicits any response although power
[09:51:24] <birkoff> to those peripherals and their for example lights are usual . my monitors are connected via hdmi, trying to replug those didn't help either. I have xfce4-power-manager running for my desktop but it is not set to enter hibernate, suspend or switch off anything after any threshold whatsoever. I also have 'upower' installed with its service and daemon running but not being battery run doesn't make
[09:51:25] <birkoff> sense. My GPU is nvidia and so is the display driver that is loaded and used while X is running (with no problems whatsoever). Nouveau driver is in the blacklist so it doesn't load. What else could cause this weird "sleep mode" that my machine wouldn't wake up from be caused of ?

[21:00:19] <george_orwl84> Hi, I messed up something while playing around with ARandR. I chose a wrong laptop resolution. Since then the display turned black. Xrandr showing "Can't open display". Reboot doesn't do anything. After SDDM it turns black. How can I reset xrandr to default settings again?
