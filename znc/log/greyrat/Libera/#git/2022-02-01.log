[03:10:47] <foo> mackerman: 5557e31 is where I did git rm --cached      , ahh, the issue is - it might be merging it in, and instead of ignoring it it's deleting the file which I don't want it to do. I just want it to ignore it
[03:10:52] <foo> mackerman: I didn't do git clean
[03:12:02] <mackerman> "git rm --cached"  does not mean ignore this file, it means delete it from the index
[03:12:36] <foo> mackerman: I thought it simply stopped tracking
[03:12:53] <foo> mackerman: is there a way to rectify this?
[03:13:05] <mackerman> You already did, you  committed a delete.
[03:14:16] <foo> mackerman: maybe once someone checks out from master and resets their branches, when I merge in it won't try to delete the file
[03:14:24] <foo> The issue is it's deleting the local file when I try to merge or switch branches
[03:15:24] <mackerman> Possibly that's moving before and after  5557e31,  applying the delete again.
[03:15:56] <foo> mackerman: yes, and it's deleting the local file. Haha. I think if everyone merges from master (which has that) it should fix this, right?

As for B, if I'm following, someone will need to *manually* add the file *after* they merge in master, correct? Unless you're implying git will indefinitely attempt to delete this file always and forever...
[03:21:34] <mackerman> If you must have some version of  app/config.py  in version control, example or whtever,  consider renaming it to a different file name.

[03:45:08] <foo> Might be frustrating or annoying trying to track with me on this, really appreciate it.
[03:47:44] <rewt> you need to either commit a deletion of that file (in every branch that's open and may get merged back), or remove it from your !history ... .gitignore only applies to files that are not tracked

[03:49:06] <rewt> !rewrite
[03:49:06] <gitinfo> Rewriting public history is not recommended. Everyone who has pulled the old history will have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push --force-with-lease <remote> <branch>` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum
[03:49:08] <foo> rewt: By "you need to either commit a deletion of that file" are you saying "merge in master into all active branches" ? (where this has been removed in master)
[03:49:29] <foo> rewt: ... and then add the file back?
[03:49:29] <rewt> in master, and all branches that will eventually be merged to master
[03:49:44] <rewt> make a commit that deletes the file
[03:50:25] <rewt> don't add the file back... you said you don't want it in the repo
[03:50:31] <foo> rewt: so make a commit that deletes the file in master, merge into all branches that will get merged back into master at some point, and then add the config back and at that point .gitignore should kick in and ignore it after the fact, right?
[03:50:37] <foo> rewt: I want it in my working tree, not in my repo
[03:51:45] <rewt> "merge into all branches that will get merged back into master at some point" -- only if merging master into those branches is appropriate... it may not be, depending on your workflow... just adding a commit to delete the file to those branches should be good enough
[03:52:08] <foo> rewt: copy, and then add it back? :) I realize I may sound like a broken record, appreciate ya'lls patience with me.
[03:52:57] <rewt> if you mean "add it back to your working tree", that's up to you; you can have whatever you want there, as long as you properly manage .gitignore to not actuall add files you don't want added
[03:53:30] <mackerman> You can get a copy of that specific file   prior to its deletion with  "git checkout"  if desired
[03:53:39] <rewt> `git add` is the command to add files to the index which end up in the repo, so "add the file" usually means add it to the index/repo
[03:53:59] <foo> rewt: haha, I can see how my vague language is not serving me... at all.
[03:54:05] <foo> I mean add it back to my working tree
[03:54:12] <foo> Not add it back to the repo

[10:47:39] <fdan> hi guys
[10:47:45] <fdan> i have pushed a commit to master without reviews
[10:47:50] <fdan> I would want to revert that
[10:48:07] <osse> !revert
[10:48:08] <gitinfo> That's a rather ambiguous question... options: a) make a commit that "undoes" the effects of an earlier commit [man git-revert]; b) discard uncommitted changes in the working tree [git reset --hard]; c) undo committing [git reset --soft HEAD^]; d) restore staged versions of files [git checkout -p]; e) move the current branch to a different point(possibly losing commits)[git reset --hard $COMMIT]?
[10:48:24] <osse> you want (a) or (e)
[10:48:49] <fdan> osse: when i do a e) what happens?
[10:48:57] <fdan> git reset --hard <newcommitid>
[10:49:06] <osse> you have to push --force
[10:49:09] <osse> !rewrite
[10:49:09] <gitinfo> Rewriting public history is not recommended. Everyone who has pulled the old history will have to do work (and you'll have to tell them to), so it's infinitely better to just move on. If you must, you can use `git push --force-with-lease <remote> <branch>` to force (and the remote may reject that, anyway). See http://goo.gl/waqum

[14:18:11] <capjack[m]> cbreak: Thanks
[14:18:39] <capjack[m]> 1. Why [this guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/git_rebase.html) tells me to call `git fetch origin main` before the rebase?
[14:18:51] <capjack[m]> 2. How do I rebase against my current master branch, instead of origin's one?

[14:19:51] <cbreak> 1. git fetch fetches data from remotes
[14:20:12] <cbreak> git fetch origin main fetches the main branch from origin into the remote tracking branch for it, which would be called origin/main
[14:20:31] <cbreak> 2. just refer to the branch you want to rebase on.

[14:21:22] <cbreak> you can also rebase on commits without common ancestors, but that's harder, and requires more words. see man page for details

[14:26:15] <mackerman> By fetching then rebasing onto a remote tracking ref,  they don't need to merge into a local branch for that to be up to date.

[15:26:25] <chilversc> not sure my question was seen in all those disconnects
[15:26:28] <chilversc> how do I shallow clone a specific tag by its full path? I've tried; git clone --branch refs/tags/v2.0.0 but it complains that "fatal: Remote branch refs/tags/v2.0.0 not found in upstream origin", though I can see it when I run "git ls-remote"
[15:26:47] <osse> chilversc: it seems to magically work if you don't use the full path. Is that not an option?
[15:27:23] <chilversc> it does, I was just wondering if I can be specific that it has to be a tag, and for some repositories I want it to be a tag in a specific namespace, eg refs/tags/releases/...

[15:29:02] <osse> Seems weird that it's not possible to use full ref names, but that seems to be the case anyway
[15:29:15] <osse> for the namespace thing I'd still expect just removing 'refs/tags/' to work
[15:29:30] <chilversc> yeah, so no idea how I would shallow clone a github pull request
[15:29:33] *** Joins: hinderaker (hinderaker@user/hinderaker)
[15:30:07] <osse> github offers predictable urls for downloading a zip/url
[15:30:09] <osse> can try that
[15:30:53] <chilversc> yeah, I was just using that as an example as I know they use refs such as refs/pull/4/merge
[15:31:03] <chilversc> which seems impossible to shallow clone using git

[15:35:39] <chilversc> and then later https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/builtin/clone.c#L1224
[15:36:10] <chilversc> so its not obvious what the final value being check is as it seems to depend upon some local config, and the response from the remote (transport_fetch_refs)

[18:28:32] <LuxuryMode> I just started working with a team that uses the following workflow: when people start work on a ticket, they create a branch off of `master`. But pull requests are not opened against `master`. Instead a new branch off of `master` is created to represent a new release called `release-n` (where `n` is the release number). Then, all the branches that should be included in this release are merged into that branch.
[18:28:34] <LuxuryMode> Thoughts on the pros and cons of this approach?

[19:26:33] <LuxuryMode> mackerman: And I think the argument made for this approach is something along the lines of: it's easier to pick and choose exactly which features you want to deploy. You aren't always ready to release features even if the work has been completed.
[19:26:35] <LuxuryMode> If you have a git workflow that is something like feature branches -> development branch -> staging branch -> production/master then when you're ready to do a production deploy, for example, you are stuck having to take _all_ features that have been merged into the staging branch.

[19:50:45] <imMute> LuxuryMode: "You aren't always ready to release features even if the work has been completed"    that's what feature flags are for.  ;)
[19:51:10] <LuxuryMode> Good point imMute! This is the kind of feedback I was looking for.
[19:51:49] <imMute> personally, I like having feature branches merged into master and then a release-X.Y branch made off master when it's ready for release (and bug fixes and last minute stuff done on the release branch, which gets merged back to master when the release is cut).
[19:52:07] <LuxuryMode> So you'd argue it makes more sense to have a simpler workflow of something like dev -> staging -> prod ... or whatever it may be and then control what is released via feature flags rather than by (cherry) picking branches/commits like this?
[19:52:12] <imMute> that was for a project that released every month or two, not multiple times a week.  so your desired release cadence should be taken into account
[19:52:20] <LuxuryMode> That makes sense.
[19:52:38] <mackerman> Branching features off a release branch, and fixes off the primary branch, seems backwards to me.
[19:52:47] <imMute> LuxuryMode: typically, yeah.    my experience with that was for an "embedded" Linux device.  not something like a webapp (which I think would require a different process)
[19:53:11] <imMute> mackerman: was that for me?
[19:53:29] <mackerman> That was for LuxuryMode
[19:53:31] <imMute> mackerman: because I agree, that flow sounds weird.
[19:53:34] <mackerman> I don't think the thing itself really matters. Webapps aren't special snowflakes.
[19:54:03] <LuxuryMode> Right, I hear that mackerman

[19:54:43] <mackerman> Features go in the next version. When those are done, branch releases for maintenance.
[19:55:25] <mackerman> Fixes might be done in master first, then backported to release branches as required.
[19:56:21] <imMute> mackerman: I believe it affects release cadence.  some web app teams want to be able to release 1+ times a week.  the product I was working on didn't need releases more frequently than every month or two because of how slow the deployment process was (done by other people who bought the hardware, so we didn't control it)
[19:56:57] <LuxuryMode> Right. I have always preferred avoiding merge commits also, but I don't know if there's really any justification for it. So if you were trying to get work into, say, a `development` branch and other changes have already been merged in, you'd rebase before opening a PR so your changeset would go in as a FF.
[19:58:23] <imMute> the only people who furiously advocate for no merge commits are the ones who havn't learned about --first-parent

[21:44:00] <imMute> I really wish "git fetch" was spelled "git pull" and "git pull" was spelled some other way
[21:44:02] <zumba_addict> i just ran `git fetch --tags` and still returning an old one
[21:44:14] <imMute> zumba_addict: do you have the tag in your local repo?
[21:44:17] <zumba_addict> yes
[21:44:40] <zumba_addict>  let me see if it's in master in the ui
[21:44:49] <imMute> is it in the ancestry of the branch you're currently on?
[21:45:15] <zumba_addict> just confirmed, it's in master branch where I created the tag
[21:45:30] <zumba_addict> in my terminal, I'm in master
[21:45:35] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[21:45:57] <imMute> your master and gitlab's master aren't necessarily the same
[21:45:59] <zumba_addict> I'm sorry, I don't understand your question. How do I do it?

[21:46:32] <zumba_addict> but I thought once we run git fetch, it should pull it right?
[21:46:50] <imMute> git log --graph --oneline --decorate=short | grep <new tag name>     # does that show the tag you're looking for?
[21:46:57] *** Joins: emf (~emf@2620:10d:c090:400::5:b471)
[21:47:00] <imMute> fetch won't update your local master branch.
[21:47:10] <zumba_addict> oh maybe because it has the same commit sha
[21:47:14] <zumba_addict> and the other one is winning
[21:47:48] <zumba_addict> I'll delete the tags created by the ci
[21:47:57] <imMute> what has the same sha as what?
[21:48:49] <zumba_addict> both the tag created by ci and the manual tag I created today
[21:49:13] <zumba_addict> so I deleted the tag that was created by ci and left the one I created v1.132
[21:49:37] <zumba_addict> I deleted it from Gitlab ui console. I ran git fetch again then the describe. it's still display the old one
[21:50:09] <imMute> you have to delete the local tag manually,  git doesn't prune tags.

[21:51:49] <gitinfo> the git-tag manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-tag.html
[21:54:47] <zumba_addict> I see the new one now. So I guess for jenkins job, it shouldn't find the old bad tag since it will be a new git clone. Correct?

[23:41:51] <gitinfo> [!configfiles] It is recommended to store local configuration data in a file which is not tracked by git, but certain deployment scenarios(such as Heroku) may require otherwise. See https://gist.github.com/1423106 for some ideas
