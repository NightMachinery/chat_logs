[01:38:53] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Since the first Swig opened in 2010, dozens of soda-shop chains and independent soda shacks have opened from Idaho to Utah to Arizona, an area of the Mountain West sometimes called the Mormon Corridor. A significant portion of the region’s population belongs to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the church’s prohibition on tea and coffee has spurred a
[01:38:53] <feepbot> niche beverage market that has intensified in the last decade, hitting a fever pitch during the pandemic. New soda shops are also increasingly opening in other parts of the country, including South Carolina, Florida, Texas and Oklahoma...Swig, which employs about 700 people, plans to open 10 to 15 shops a year, and in two or three years, Ms. Tanner said she hopes there will be 200
[01:38:53] <feepbot> or more shops across the United States. The soda-shop chains pay special attention to the history of Starbucks — which decades ago expanded at a breakneck pace, from fewer than 20 stores in 1987 to more than 100 in 1992. Worldwide, there are more than 30,000 Starbucks today. Many soda-shop owners believe their industry could be at least that successful. “There is a great
[01:38:58] <feepbot> soda-drinking culture in the Mountain West region,” Mr. Auernig said, adding, “What Starbucks originally did for coffee was kind of our idea with soda.”...After Mitt Romney was photographed drinking a Diet Coke while running for president in 2012, the church posted a statement on its website clarifying its stance on caffeine, saying it “does not prohibit the use of
[01:38:58] <feepbot> caffeine.” The Word of Wisdom, the church’s health code, specifically bans hot caffeinated drinks, like coffee and tea.' https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/06/dining/swig-soda-shop-chains.html uh oh

[01:51:50] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Ms. Diaz started going to the soda shop once or twice a week after her sister began working at one. Now, she goes only a couple of times a month. “I just realized that probably drinking that much soda probably wasn’t the best for me,” she said. Many of the dirty sodas, which come in sizes up to 44 ounces, can contain up to 1,000 calories. Rebecca Fronberg, a program
[01:51:50] <feepbot> manager at the Utah Department of Health, said that “it’s not really great to drink our calories” and that sugar in the diet “is always a concern for diabetes, heart disease and all kinds of things.” Despite that, many seek out soda as a pick-me-up, a small indulgence. In Clinton, Utah, Nichole Richins, 42, lives within 10 minutes of 10 different soda shops. Her usual
[01:51:50] <feepbot> order is a Polar Punch from Swig, a blended energy drink with blackberry, raspberry, strawberry, ginger ale and vanilla cream. She visits the shop about once a week, “but if it’s a hard week, it will be more.” “That’s my extra treat,” she said.'

Similar systems are known to exist in quorum sensing feedbacks in species such as Clostridioides
[02:09:58] <feepbot> (formerly Clostridium) difficile (97), suggesting that nonconstitutive phenotypes can be induced based upon biointeractions with adjoining bacterial cells. Given the metabolic and fitness costs associated with antibiotic production, it is not surprising that researchers are also finding antibiotic synthesis linked to quorum sensing in cocultures (98, 99), particularly as a
[02:09:58] <feepbot> mechanism to limit social cheaters (100), suggesting that a main outcome of these interactions is related to community building and stability (101). This “secret society” hypothesis, where known members are trusted, new members undergo hazing-like phenotype acquisition, and potential newcomers are continuously recruited, also provides a potential explanation for why ARGs in the
[02:10:03] <feepbot> clinic are often associated with plasmids. Preantibiotic-era plasmids often maintained a producer-resistance pairing. This may have been beneficial in increasing the likelihood of a pair of successful community members becoming neighbors again in another community even if they are not phylogenetically related. The probability of a mutualistic association could be increased in the
[02:10:03] <feepbot> future by the sharing of a plasmid by a producer: in essence, an initiation ritual.'

[05:46:40] <gwern> shawwwn: I think his point is that IPFS gives you a domain name/URL, which is content-addressable and so allows for all sorts of tricks, but there is not necessarily any node which actually stores the actual raw binary which has been addressed. as I understood it, IPFS was basically 'best-effort caching' - nodes may cache your content if they feel like it, but they may also just relay the...
[05:46:46] <gwern> ...request elsewhere to find someone else who does have it (ie you)
[05:47:20] <gwern> so the speed will depend on how many nodes decide to cache your content and their location/speed, backstopped by your own server
[05:48:13] <gwern> there might be a node really close by to the requesting user. or it might have to pingpong around until it reaches your raspberry pi in your bedroom in antarctica serving files over satellite

[05:50:06] <saturn2> at least it's content-addressed so anyone who cares can continue hosting it
[05:50:09] <gwern> (I assume many public IPFS nodes implement some sort of popularity-based heuristic where they prioritize popular hashes, so for long tail stuff like NFT, it won't get replicated much and you'd better have your own hosting arranged)
[05:50:38] <saturn2> with a regular URL it can vanish forever if the provider goes away, there's a domain renewal lapse, etc etc
[05:51:24] <gwern> yeah, and there's no automatic way for the DNS to find a backup. the user has to do that. they have to know to look it up in the IA or something
[05:53:10] <saturn2> IPFS isn't really intended to preserve content that no one cares about forever at no cost - that's not possible
[05:54:02] <gwern> it certainly is tricky. something like freenet tries to do it mostly by exploiting users being willing to provide spare disk space as a default and to potentially speed up their own browsing
[05:54:20] <gwern> I'm not sure IPFS even tries that much
[05:56:32] <shawwwn> I was trying to ask about the average case performance of a 1GB transfer
[05:57:02] <shawwwn> I get all that, but in practice, ipfs is served by boxen
[05:57:15] <shawwwn> And those boxen have measurable performance
[05:57:19] <gwern> then I think the answer is just 'however long 1GB takes from your favorite hetzner boxen'
[05:57:23] <saturn2> if you want it to be fast, you can throw your own servers at it

But the improvement of the new, larger model over GPT-3 is massive. Improvement on physical commonsense intuition is likewise massive. Addendum: On page 79 they have a chart showing how things
[06:52:39] <feepbot> improve as you increase model size. There are several examples of sudden jumps in capability when model size is increased by some small factor. For physical intuition, for example, things held pretty steady at between about 20% and 24% accuracy from 44M --> 117M --> 417M --> 1.4B. But then at around 7.1B performance shot up to over 41%; and continued rising at 280B, to almost 60%.
[06:52:39] <feepbot> General Knowledge JSON is another example where there is a huge jump -much larger than the others; as is Human Organs Senses, where the gain is especially impressive, given what the task is about (I presume it's common sense type questions about how things look, feel, taste, and so on). Also see "Physics MC". Oh, and "Dark Humor Detection" saw very few gains from 44M --> 117M -->
[06:52:44] <feepbot> 417M --> 1.4B --> 7.1B, but then saw a massive jump at 280B, with a score of over 83% accurate.' https://www.reddit.com/r/thisisthewayitwillbe/comments/rbvfou/language_modelling_at_scale_deepmind_jumping_on/

[08:54:13] <feepbot> <gwern> 'The idea that adipose tissue might serve as a reservoir for pathogens is not new, Dr. Dixit said. Body fat is known to harbor a number of them, including H.I.V. and the influenza virus. The coronavirus appears to be able to evade the body fat’s immune defenses, which are limited and incapable of fighting it effectively. And in people who are obese, there can be a lot of
[08:54:15] <feepbot> body fat. A man whose ideal weight is 170 pounds but who weighs 250 pounds is carrying a substantial amount of fat in which the virus may “hang out,” replicate and trigger a destructive immune system response, said Dr. David Kass, a professor of cardiology at Johns Hopkins. “If you really are very obese, fat is the biggest single organ in your body,” Dr. Kass said. The
[08:54:15] <feepbot> coronavirus “can infect that tissue and actually reside there,” he said. “Whether it hurts it, kills it or at best, it’s a place to amplify itself — it doesn’t matter. It becomes kind of a reservoir.” As the inflammatory response snowballs, cytokines trigger even more inflammation and the release of additional cytokines. “It’s like a perfect storm,” he said. Dr.
[08:54:19] <feepbot> Blish and her colleagues speculated that infected body fat may even contribute to “long Covid,” a condition describing troublesome symptoms like fatigue that persist for weeks or months after recovery from an acute episode.'

[19:21:30] <gwern> problematic. you really should start simpler and work your way up with lots of test cases, known examples, and graphing
[19:21:57] <gwern> I mean, this is functional programming. there's no reason you can't print out the entire graph
[19:21:59] <PapuaHardyNet> on the bright side, the way I debugged this was due to logging, which allowed me to find out the *exact* step where I hit a loss = nan

[19:23:05] <PapuaHardyNet> re: known examples, I have one test in every file for each block that makes up the model, but it is more of a "does it work like before" instead of a chaos monkey test or a true TDD style test

[21:47:05] <PapuaHardyNet> so after reading 'The Rebel Sell' I've realized many of my consumerist desires were attempts to assert and signal my individuality and distinction
[21:48:27] <PapuaHardyNet> in a conversation with my little sister, when she remarked that my desire to leave the country is something that every ambitious young person in our country has, I found myself asking her what is wrong with that
[21:49:14] <PapuaHardyNet> I can't opt out of the status competition entirely, but I sure as hell can reduce my status anxiety and minmax my quality of life thanks to the insights in that book
[21:49:52] <PapuaHardyNet> it is a good book, I highly recommend people at least read the synopsis.
[21:49:55] <gwern> what's wrong with leaving your country? maybe your country sucks. and then your kids can be in a better country, thereby helping gradually shift the world from sucky countries to good countries
[21:51:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah if you can go somewhere better legally, I endorse it
[21:52:55] <PapuaHardyNet> to be clear, by asking her that question, I was asserting that having the same desires as millions, isn't bad per se - I was hinting that I did not feel the need to assert my individuality by signalling aspirations others do not have

[23:14:43] <catern> dear #lesswrong what remote team-building activity that costs money (up to $150 per person) should I do with my coworkers
[23:15:22] <gwern> buy knockoff ogrepriced ape NFTs and set up a private discord
[23:15:49] <dv2> Give everyone $150
[23:15:58] <catern> gwern: how is that fun
[23:16:22] <gwern> you'll bond over the rising prices and financial freedom and looking down on outsiders who just don't get it
[23:17:10] <catern> that's actually a really good idea, although probably too bizarre to actually do
[23:17:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: D&D obviously
[23:17:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> What kind of question is this
[23:17:54] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: I don't understand the answer, what are you suggesting
[23:18:00] <catern> should we hire a professional DM or something?
[23:18:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: I mean, sure, if you want. There's lots of ways to spend money on D&D-related things. Maybe you could buy everyone a set of commemorative dice
[23:18:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, or those cool programmable dice that there was that Kickstarter for
[23:18:58] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: he said $150/person, not $1500!
[23:19:11] <gwern> start buying dice and who knows where it'll end
[23:19:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok well maybe stick with rose quartz dice or some such

[23:27:49] <gwern> the problem when you split a D&D party is that you don't get two parties, you just get several people drinking sadly by themselves
[23:30:13] <catern> I suggested that we should get a team coat of arms commissioned but I don't know if people will go for that idea
[23:31:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> That'll cost more than $150
[23:31:23] <catern> it's $150 per person
[23:31:39] <catern> surely it won't cost more than 1500 or something
[23:32:02] <catern> we could also get a team mascot design and buy a team "mascot costume"
[23:32:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh
[23:32:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: See, it was $1500 after all!
[23:32:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: They can totally afford the smart dice
[23:32:30] <gwern> but not per person
[23:32:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Eh, they can share
[23:32:37] <catern> but only one person would get the smart dice, that's not very fair
[23:33:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: Team mascot costume? That's just a euphemism for "we're all furries now"
[23:34:06] <catern> that was why I put it in quotes yes
[23:34:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can't endorse this kind of degeneracy
[23:34:46] <gwern> but does it build team morale
[23:34:48] <catern> it wasn't a real suggestion anyway
[23:35:07] <Khoth> > several people drinking sadly by themselves
[23:35:08] <Khoth> You could easily do this for $150 each
[23:35:33] <gwern> if you buy too good alcohol, though, they may not be sad
