[07:48:58] <samuely> which one should it be?

[07:49:49] <CuriosTiger> Shorthand for "We have a deal."
[07:50:14] <samuely> so 'due' doesn't make sense.
[07:50:32] <samuely> what 'we have a deal' means?
[07:51:32] <CuriosTiger> It means you have agreed to the terms of some arrangement or transaction.
[07:51:43] <samuely> like you do this and i'll do this?
[07:51:51] <CuriosTiger> For example.
[07:52:00] <CuriosTiger> It can be "I'll pay you $1500 for your car."
[07:52:28] <CuriosTiger> It can also be "If you visit me in the summer, I'll visit you at Christmas."
[07:52:38] <samuely> I see.
[07:54:04] <samuely> I want to express that I have missed the due date to register. What should I say?
[07:54:42] <snappy> I missed the due date to register.
[07:54:45] <samuely> 'due' reminds me the 'deal' story.

[12:08:50] <Maxdamantus> It's discussing whether "utf8" and "UTF 8" should be recognised by web browsers.
[12:08:53] *** Joins: Kei_N (~Kei_N@user/kei-n/x-2886111)
[12:09:34] <Maxdamantus> Not the browsers' recognition. The encoding names' recognition (by the browsers).

[12:10:44] <dminuoso> Oh, that was poorly phrased.

[12:15:47] <Maxdamantus> What's trash? The names or the encoding forms?
[12:16:52] <Maxdamantus> UTF-8 is one of the greatest fundamental technologies created in the last few decades.
[12:17:05] <Maxdamantus> Just wish people would handle it properly in programming languages.
[12:17:31] <Maxdamantus> https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM/issues/1648
[12:18:11] <Maxdamantus> Too many people making weird string behaviour that goes against the Unicode standard, which expects strings to be byte arrays.
[12:19:27] <dminuoso> Maxdamantus: Yes, but they asked for "who's recognition"
[12:19:59] <dminuoso> Mmm
[12:20:02] <dminuoso> I think its ambiguous.
[12:20:13] <Maxdamantus> I don't think it's ambiguous. It's arguably confusing.
[12:20:57] <Maxdamantus> "who's recognition" doesn't occur in the sentence. It's just part of vim_fans_'s question.
[12:21:05] <dminuoso> Okay lets analyze this.
[12:21:15] <Maxdamantus> "they" doesn't always refer to a "who".
[12:21:27] <dminuoso> If the subject of recognition might be a person, it would be truly ambiguous, since it could either refer to "the recognition of whom" or "the recognition by whom"
[12:21:31] <Maxdamantus> Words are words. They are not people.
[12:21:50] *** Quits: samuely (~samuel@124.93.0.144) (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[12:22:29] <Maxdamantus> It's not talking about a subject of recognition.
[12:22:44] <Maxdamantus> You can talk about "recognition of Palestine"
[12:23:32] <Maxdamantus> That doesn't mean things that Palestine recognises. It normally means Palestine being recognised (using the verb "recognise", "Palestine" would be an object)
[12:23:56] <Maxdamantus> "may effectively require Palestine's recognition", etc.
[12:25:13] <Maxdamantus> Grammatically, you might say that the antecedent of "they" is ambiguous, but in context it doesn't make sense for it to be "recognition of web browsers".

[14:18:49] <dminuoso> To state that you're on the smart end of the spectrum is anything but modest.

[16:37:15] <therufuser> Because in German for example these places are called 'Ziel' - close to 'goal' in English - and there are words like 'Reiseziel', meaning sth. like 'travel destination'
[16:38:33] <therufuser> And this to me seems more resonable. Who's to say that you are not going to be abducted by a band of pirates on a huge airship? How can you be so sure that you call this faraway place your destiny?
[16:38:48] <blkshp> Though I can't answer the question. Consider replacing "sth" with the actual word "something". The rest of your text was perfect and it's just dropped to the status of "ew" for me!
[16:39:20] <therufuser> Oh, the channel-topic was not kidding!

[18:31:00] <looney> Ok, let's take the verb "beset" as an example. Longman and Oxford (for learners) have simple definitions, too simple and generic: "to affect somebody/something in an unpleasant or harmful way". MW has three definitions: 1. trouble/harass; 2. assail; 3. surround. The problem here becomes the overlap between "trouble/harass" and "assail". Wiktionary
[18:31:00] <looney> solves that problem and only has two definitions: 1. surround; 2. assail

[23:08:18] <GuiToris> I checked the subtitles of 'How to lose a guy in 10 days' German American movie, you may have seen it, anyway, because I was looking for a phrase that I thought I heard there... Well I didn't find it. How good is this? 'Are you ready to enter a new phase in our friendship?'
