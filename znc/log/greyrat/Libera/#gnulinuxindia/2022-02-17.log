[12:29:19] <AryaK[m]> yes
[12:29:55] <JB[m]> how do u use tmux buffer outside of tmux
[12:30:08] <JB[m]> like in a browser
[12:30:25] <AryaK[m]> so you want to copy the tmux buffer and paste it into your browser?
[12:30:26] <JB[m]> i copied from tmux and now paste it in browser
[12:30:34] <JB[m]> AryaK[m]: yes
[12:30:45] <AryaK[m]> wait in archwiki
[12:30:50] <AryaK[m]> it shows easy way
[12:31:15] <AryaK[m]> bind-key u capture-pane \; save-buffer /tmp/tmux-buffer \; run-shell "$TERMINAL -e urlview /tmp/tmux-buffer"
[12:31:23] <AryaK[m]> you can pipe that into xclip
[12:31:42] <AryaK[m]> so do capture-pane; save-buffer /tmp/tmux-buffer and then pipe its output
[12:31:44] <AryaK[m]> into xclip
[12:33:08] <JB[m]> AryaK[m]: that works but isnt there an in built functionality to do this ?
[12:33:48] <AryaK[m]> idts
[12:34:15] <JB[m]> because i was inside a server and it didnt had xclip. i was stuck there

[23:43:14] <Zbnssn[m]> and tinker whether if it works or not
[23:43:20] <Zbnssn[m]> that's how most people learn
