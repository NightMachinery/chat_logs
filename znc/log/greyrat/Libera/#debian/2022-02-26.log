[00:00:05] <Khepra> can you just answer greycat's question please
[00:00:09] * sussudio ponders if this is "yrdsb/robot56" again
[00:00:14] <Awaru> ls -ld gives: drwxr-xr-x 2 1000 awaru 78 Feb 25 11:43
[00:00:32] <Khepra> Awaru: `id awaru`
[00:00:36] <greycat> Your home directory is owned by UID 1000 but your UID is not 1000.  So you'll have to figure out what's going on here.
[00:00:51] <greycat> Did you change your user's entry in /etc/passwd by hand or something?
[00:00:56] <Awaru> aah
[00:01:03] * Khepra bets on misplaced rsync
[00:01:03] <Awaru> that explaines everything
[00:01:05] <Awaru> thank you
[00:01:18] <Awaru> in which file is the user table again?
[00:01:24] <Awaru> where i can change the uid's?
[00:01:24] <Khepra> why?
[00:01:32] <Khepra> you don't

[00:01:55] <Awaru> because thats there where i changed the user ids from 1000 to somethin else, so thats why they dont work as it comes out now
[00:02:09] <Khepra> now... I'd say use -R with that? but it'd be a bit of blind blanket thing to do, and may you should, maybe you shouldn't
[00:02:26] <Khepra> Awaru: what?
[00:02:34] <Khepra> you manually changed numbers in passwd or shadow?
[00:02:40] <greycat> I already said /etc/passwd
[00:03:11] <Awaru> Khepra, just changed the user id
[00:03:25] <greycat> Why?  Are you setting up NFS or something?
[00:03:32] <Khepra> Awaru: next time use usermod(8)

[00:03:54] <greycat> This is not the way.
[00:03:59] <Awaru> yea i know
[00:04:03] <Awaru> changed it now to sudo
[00:04:10] <Khepra> HOWEVER, changing uid of a user will not automagically change files/dirs ownerships so you should NOT do that manually.

[00:04:56] <Khepra> usermod -u 1000 awaru
[00:05:01] <Awaru> but however... what is the file with the user table where all the users are saved in?
[00:05:04] <Awaru> does anyone know?
[00:05:07] <Awaru> need that now
[00:05:09] <greycat> I told you TWICE.
[00:05:09] <Khepra> you were told twice
[00:05:14] <greycat> No wait.  Three times.
[00:05:29] <Khepra> there are two files tho
[00:05:40] <greycat> the UID is only in one of them
[00:05:44] <Khepra> see passwd(1) and shadow(5) manpages
[00:06:28] <Awaru> i only wanna change the uid of another user i accidentally changed the uid
[00:06:33] <Khepra> "where all the users are saved in"   the answer is those two files.   "where one breaks system by manually changing numbers"   is passwd(1)
[00:06:35] <Awaru> so i need the file where they saved
[00:06:45] <greycat> Use "vipw" and fix it.  Or try to figure out usermod like Khepra said.
[00:07:10] <greycat> I've said the name of the file 3 times and the preferred command to use to edit it, twice.
[00:07:12] <Awaru> didnt tell me any dir yet
[00:07:16] <greycat> *PLONK*
[00:07:22] <greycat> Done.  Next!
[00:07:24] <Awaru> i think i probably gonna need to google it
[00:07:52] <Awaru> even tho that seems to be a bit hard (i tried already, im not asking a questiong before googling first)
[00:08:08] <Khepra> Awaru: passwd(1) means `man 1 passwd`
[00:08:30] <Khepra> the manpage has FILES section  (many do)
[00:08:50] <Khepra> the FILES section says /etc/passwd    User account information. that's the file you're looking for.
[00:08:51] <Awaru> ooooooooooh
[00:08:53] <Awaru> sry greycat
[00:09:04] <Awaru> i overlooked it
[00:09:08] <Awaru> now i got it
[00:09:30] <Awaru> sry rlly
[00:09:31] <Awaru> ry
[00:09:32] <Khepra> SEE ALSO section for further manpages to peruse, namely the one of shadow(5) to see what THAT file does with user accts
[00:09:51] <greycat> greycat also said /etc/passwd three times, and vipw two times
[00:10:23] <Khepra> yea. but I like to teach not only how to fish, but what the fisher are there, which baits to use, how to make the grill and WHERE to look up all that again :))
[00:10:30] <Khepra> *fishes
[00:10:35] <greycat> that's fair
[00:10:59] <Awaru> btw there i have another question already
[00:11:06] <Awaru> when i try to do a command wiht sudo...
[00:11:10] <greycat> "man -k password" would be a good starting point if one wishes to go about it that way
[00:11:15] <Awaru> it asks me for a passwd
[00:11:24] <Awaru> i suppose that this is the root passwd it wants
[00:11:38] <Khepra> I love the sound of apropos :)
[00:11:39] <Awaru> but i enter my own passwd (the passwd of the user i am corretnly logged in as) and it works
[00:11:48] <Awaru> thats really strange
[00:11:50] <Khepra> Awaru: you suppose wrong
[00:11:59] <Awaru> and shouldnt be right so or?
[00:12:02] <Khepra> sudo uses user's password. su(1) uses root's
[00:12:10] <Awaru> ah ok
[00:12:17] <Khepra> to be precise, sudo uses the password of the user who is invoking sudo
[00:12:17] <Awaru> but then every user can use sudo?
[00:12:26] <Khepra> if they're permitted to
[00:12:35] <Khepra> by default, users in "sudo" group can invoke it
[00:12:47] <Khepra> that's all configurable via sudoers(5)
[00:13:24] <Khepra> so yeah, don't put users you don't trust into "sudo" group
[00:13:50] <Khepra> the sudoers(5) policy is very versatile and you can actually limit what each user or group can do or access via sudo.
[00:14:45] <Awaru> just tested it , created a new user "testuser123"... and he can uses sudo to cd /root
[00:14:59] <Khepra> HOW did you test it
[00:15:10] <Awaru> i created the new user

[00:16:24] <Awaru> "testuser123 is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported."
[00:16:31] <Khepra> but the fact that it asked passwd and didn't bark out loudly that you may not sudo .... that's concerning
[00:16:36] <Khepra> ah, there.
[00:16:36] <Awaru> what is the sudoers file and where is it?
[00:16:45] <Khepra> man 5 sudoers
[00:17:11] <Awaru> thats too much text sry
[00:17:15] <Khepra> however, that's a bit very arcane literature. I Recommend not touching it until you're very familiar with it. you're still setting up that public server, yes?
[00:17:34] <Awaru> no not right

[00:18:29] <Awaru> i just would know this one thing yet.. before i continue with my work
[00:18:45] <Khepra> alternatively..... look into "doas", which you probably know from openbsd.
[00:18:46] <Awaru> about which user is sudo or not and
[00:19:18] <Khepra> just note that some packages depend on sudo and may even install sudoers files, so if you rely on doas, you'll have to be mindful of that and adjust the policy

[01:00:49] <coc0nut> hm you know when you start a debian without logging in, it goes to sleep or hibernate. any good way to avoid that?
[01:01:48] <somiaj> coc0nut: this is going to be apart of the display manager
[01:02:01] <somiaj> coc0nut: what display manager are you using?
[01:02:56] <coc0nut> clean install... i did some commands and masked the suspend and hibernate and all sleeping things.. i was logging on to a vpn btw. might be the reason for dc this time
[01:03:21] <somiaj> you still haven't answered what display manager you are using? Did you install gnome?
[01:03:30] <coc0nut> wayland i think

[01:03:47] <somiaj> that is not a display manager, but it sounds like you are using gnome with gdm3?

[01:05:23] <somiaj> looks like you need to edit /etc/gdm3/greeter.dconf-defaults as stated in that bug report. This setting appears to be default to comply with power saving regulartions in european and usa

[13:57:39] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[13:57:45] <PerfDave> A fair amount of wifi chipsets still need non-free firmware to operate in Linux

[14:00:06] <taktaktak> So i just get the unoffcial iso
[14:00:12] <taktaktak> Any specific one?
[14:00:16] <PerfDave> taktaktak: You need to get a firmware package onto your system. If you can find a way of doing that, you don't need to reinstall. Otherwise reinstalling with the firmware ISO might be easier.

[14:19:25] <taktaktak> I chose no
[14:19:34] <taktaktak> It says network autoconfiguration failed
[14:19:48] <taktaktak> Your network is probably not using the dhcp protocol
[14:21:12] <Khepra> there's nothing you can do then. install without network, and then try to see if there's firmware missing (from dmesg) and if manually shipping in corresponding .deb would suffice.

[14:22:56] <Khepra> taktaktak: once installed, run    dmesg | grep -i firmware     and see if it complains about missing firmware paths. you can imgur a photo of that, or if it's an oneliner, type it here and we can check via apt-file, or the bot

[14:25:14] <taktaktak> Cause there's nothing i can do here
[14:25:31] <Khepra> in general you don't need a mirror.   deb.debian.org CDN would work just fine, for:
[14:25:35] <Khepra> !bullseye sources.list

See <deb-src> <contrib> <non-free> <bullseye-updates> and `man sources.list`.
[14:25:48] <Khepra> you can always later change that to specific mirrors if you want

[15:40:55] <Khepra> itself and tools it needs for remote download of packages, yes. I don't know how exactly. does it already unpack into RAM or not.
[15:41:00] <Cool_Fire> the installer isn't a live-cd no, but it's sort of a live environment. But my guess is as good as yours if it'll actually work with the live-toram thing
[15:41:38] <kee> I'd guess it wouldn't; the Live CD has some kind of compressed image and loopback device that the installer lacks.
[15:42:14] <Khepra> kee: see also:  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/118965/how-to-create-a-debian-live-usb-with-persistence
[15:42:36] <kee> Khepra: I've seen that (though will double-check).

[15:44:02] <kee> I would like a normal Debian, if possible.
[15:45:08] <Khepra> I'd really recommend debootstrap. it's easy once you get the hang of it.
[15:45:25] <Khepra> and you learn quite a lot

[15:46:13] <kee> I've used debootstrap before. Learning is good, but the machine isn't for me, and if I do it wrong, that's somebody who'll never use Debian again.
[15:47:27] <kee> Then again, the only things I'm concerned about are firmware and grub…
[15:47:47] <Khepra> of course you test it. if it boots and works as expected, it's no different than being installed by an installer
[15:48:16] <kee> Yeah, I just remembered that debootstrap can do normal installs (I've only ever used it for minimal chroot installs).
[15:50:15] <Khepra> not sure what you mean by that. debootstrap installs a very minimal environment. you still have to install the kernel, grub, set root password, create unprivileged users, set up networking and/or install a desktop task (eg. gnome) which then might come with networkmanager. locale. timezone.

[15:53:52] <Khepra> it sounds a lot but keep in mind debian packages are all designed to set up themselves to a functional default. for example, "just" installing grub-pc will install grub AND configure it based on autodetected filesystems.
[15:54:18] *** Joins: Tempesta (~Tempesta@user/tempesta)
[15:54:19] <kee> Grub is the hard part, because grub sets itself up on the current machine.
[15:54:38] <kee> Everything else, I trust to automagically install when I install the package (e.g. task-lxde).
[15:54:40] <Khepra> kee: nope. you do it from chroot so it sees only the USB device and partitions
[15:56:14] <kee> And then manually copy the thing to the…
[15:56:25] <kee> I'm silly. The EFI partition is on the memory stick.
[15:57:09] <silly> no, i am silly and the EFI partition is on the disk

[15:58:28] <Khepra> say you partition your USB. use gpt.     sda1 is ESP or bios_grub. sda2 is rootfs. you don't want swap on usb. you mkfs sda2 (and sda1 if ESP). you mkdir /mnt/rootfs.   you mount sda2 to /mnt/rootfs. you mount sda1 to /mnt/rootfs/boot/efi  (mkdir it first) if that's ESP. then you debootstrap to /mnt/rootfs. then you unshare -m, mount -t proc, mount -R dev and sysm and chroot into /mnt/rootfs.   source
[15:58:34] <Khepra> /etc/profile , set up resolv.conf and you're ready to apt install everything else:  grub, kernel, desktop task, vim, setup networking, locale, timezone, passwd for root, useradd unprivileged, passwd that, usermod -a -G sudo <user>, apt instlal sudo first.    and that's mostly it.

[19:43:31] <Nitrigaur> coc0nut, I have started systemd-resolved, which added the 127.0.0.1:53 to my resolv.conf, yet the resolution still fails for this record, even after flushing the caches. Note that this DNS-record is happily resolved on my desktop, so it does seem to be valid.
[19:44:23] <coc0nut> does the other machines in your network point to your machine as the dns server ?
[19:45:34] <Nitrigaur> coc0nut, the server is provided by OVH as part of their cloud-init. This machine has been freshly installed today.

[19:47:41] <coc0nut> if this is your dns server on the network, then point all nodes in your network to it and it should collect all network names.
[19:49:14] <Nitrigaur> Yukiteru, NetworkManager is not active on this machine, but thank you for the suggestion.
[19:50:50] <Nitrigaur> coc0nut, I do not control the network that this server is part of (OVH Private Cloud). I only control the Debian 11 server and it's config. on that network.
[19:51:48] <coc0nut> then thats the reason. because the other computers on the network doesnt use it as the dns server.

[19:54:20] <Nitrigaur> coc0nut, I am puzzled by the fact that the txt-record test.autismesoos.nl resolves just fine, but the the test20210221._domainkey.test.autismesoos.nl record does not. Might it be filtered out due to it's length? It does contain a fairly long certificate string after all.
[19:55:19] <coc0nut> might be the type of record you have registered at your domain provider? its hard without any insight anyway... good luck :)
