[02:10:33] <gordonfish> [IO::Async] Curious. If I have just a timer in my loop (IO::Async::Timer::Periodic subclass in my case), and I hit CTRL+C, my $SIG{INT}, which called $loop->stop, stops right away and the program exits.
[02:10:53] <gordonfish> But if I also add a Net::Async::HTTP::Server, then hit CTRL+C, it doesn't exit right away, but waits until the next timer tick or server request, then exits.
[02:11:10] <gordonfish> And if I hit CTRL+C a second time, before the next tick/request, it then stops right away.
[02:11:24] <gordonfish> Is this normal behavior (on Linux) ?
[02:11:42] <gordonfish> LeoNerd, etc: ^
[02:15:13] <Grinnz> need to stop the server?
[02:17:18] <LeoNerd> Uh that doesn't sound expected, no
[02:17:34] <LeoNerd> But also, you don't want to use $SIG{INT} for that
[02:17:46] <LeoNerd> Make sure to use a real IO::Async signal watch, then it'll behave fine
[02:18:07] <gordonfish> Grinnz: Net::Async::HTTP::Server doesn't appear to have any ->stop or similar method
[02:18:08] <LeoNerd> I suspect the presence of the server is causing it to use a real epoll_pwait which will then block signals
[02:18:44] <gordonfish> LeoNerd: Ah, thanks, I'll replace with IO::Async based signal handling then.
[02:19:20] <Grinnz> i stopped doing that with POE because then POE had to wait for the current event to return control to the loop
[02:19:25] <Grinnz> which means SIGINT takes too long
[02:19:41] <Grinnz> never tried it with IO::Async
[02:21:29] <gordonfish> LeoNerd, Grinnz: Yeah $loop->attach_signal( $_, $stop ) for qw(INT TERM); did the trick, stop immediately.
[02:22:20] <gordonfish> Although one minor difference, with with %SIG, the first arg @_ is the name of the signal, and IO::Async appears to not give that to its callbacks.
[02:23:03] <gordonfish> (That is, @_ in the callback appears to be empty.)
[02:23:29] <gordonfish> Not a big deal, but it would be nice when using the same callback for multiple signals.

[03:11:14] <xenu> the most dynamic way to affect context i'm aware of are prototypes and they're known at compile time
[03:11:27] <aquanight> xenu: my experience with callcheckers tells me that things are parsed "inside out" largely.

[03:13:05] <aquanight> when the optree for an "inner" expression is being built it doesn't know what context it's in. If doesn't force a context (typically scalar), the containing op will apply context
[03:14:03] <aquanight> in the case of prototypes, it works because prototypes are triggered by the ENTERSUB op checker: all the argument op nodes have been built but not yet contexted so the ENTERSUB checker will either apply list context or apply whatever the prototype says
[03:14:51] <aquanight> but ENTERSUB itself won't know what context it is until the next containing op gives it context, e.g. scalar/array/lvalue scalar/lvalue array

[08:58:55] <ology> You'll have to fix up /etc/cntdn/nick.yaml of course.
[08:59:26] <ology> Guest23: Why do you think files are missing?
[09:00:12] <Guest23> I didnt see any reference to lib/Cntdn in the bin file

[09:00:32] <ology> use Cntdn::Nick;

[15:17:37] <aquanight> but what complicates that it in that particular case it's mixed with OPpENTERSUB_INARGS (because it's in an argument list)
[15:17:56] <aquanight> you only get LVINTRO alone when you're doing stuff like: foo = $x or (foo) = @x
[15:18:35] <aquanight> but I'm unclear on how this differs from OPf_MOD

[15:20:27] <Altreus> what the heck does UNLIKELY do
[15:20:37] <aquanight> Altreus: I think it's an optimizer hint
[15:21:00] <aquanight> tell the C path to build the "False" case as hot path
[15:21:01] <Altreus> that's even more black magic than XS
[15:21:32] <aquanight> anyway it seems for the time being I'll have to stick to my strategy of just rejecting :lvalue subs entirely
[15:22:22] <LeoNerd> That seems sensible enough; I can't imagine how an :lvalue pure sub would work
[15:22:29] <aquanight> :lvalue plus :Pure *could* make sense in some cases but I'm not sure if I need to change how it inlines
[15:23:06] <aquanight> the obvious way is that you'd embed the returned lvalue somehow. OP_CONST can store any arbitrary SV*, who's to say it *has* to be a constant one?
[15:23:09] <Altreus> I guess you could change what the pure function does purely
[15:23:21] <Altreus> although that just sounds like changing a constant to me
[15:23:48] <Altreus> sub TAU :lvalue :Pure # :)
[15:24:02] <Altreus> as we start to spin ...
