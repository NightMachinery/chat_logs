[01:23:12] <d76d5436757> bookworm: what data do you want the client to send instead of blank user/pw? I have it right now to `{}`
[01:24:05] <bookworm> considering that you have multiple different types, maybe a type field would be worthwhile
[01:24:21] <bookworm> sadly js doesn't give us proper types
[01:28:13] <d76d5436757> multiple types of what?
[01:34:37] <bookworm> here's a box. That box has either a cat or a cake inside of it. Might be good to refer to the box as a cat box and the other as a cake box no? As to avoid eating the cat?
[01:35:14] <bookworm> and maybe labeling that on the outside may be good so that you don't have to guess 😉?
[01:37:15] <bookworm> if you emit multiple different results as the payload for the same event you need to be able to easily demultiplex them and shove them into the proper code path
[01:37:42] <bookworm> so 2 choices then, emit a different event or mark the payload
[01:39:21] <bookworm> (no offense intended, please read that with the dose of humor it deserves)

[02:46:22] <d76d5436757> no worries lol. The only thing is, the auth is consumed by the same code path for both header and traditional authentication. It's just that if header auth is enabled in the config, then it will overwrite the username parameter passed to the server. If header auth is enabled, then the server will automatically create and load the user with the
[02:46:22] <d76d5436757> given username and ignore the password (to access the page, you must pass apache/whatever is acting as a proxy/auth layer, so it's not completely insecure)

[20:29:59] <benibr> greetings :-) has someone else experienced duplicate messages directly after logging into thelounge?
[20:31:18] <bookworm> can you reproduce that? As in does it happen whenever you reconnect?
[20:32:36] <bookworm> and can you clarify what you mean by TL makes two connections to a new network? As in you actually get two entries on the network list?
[20:33:36] <benibr> jep I could reproduce that. I just redeploy the whole VM right now, will test again in a few minutes
[20:34:12] <benibr> and yes, I actually got two entries in the network list
[20:35:53] *** Joins: Vercas (~Vercas@gateway/tor-sasl/vercas)
[20:40:11] <benibr> hmm still the same with a new VM. very strange
[20:41:44] <bookworm> how did you install TL?
[20:42:01] <bookworm> any plugins?
[20:42:58] <benibr> installed the .deb no manually installed plugins, just changed the config to use LDAP
[21:09:00] <bookworm> benibr: can you try switching to the normal user auth backend? Is this ldap specific?
[21:09:31] <bookworm> it certainly doesn't happen on any of my local installs in either distro
[21:09:37] <bookworm> but I also don't use ldap
[21:10:25] <benibr> you mean private mode with local accounts?
[21:10:32] <bookworm> yes
[21:10:38] <benibr> i will
[21:10:51] <bookworm> you said you tested it with multiple browsers?
[21:11:08] <bookworm> so it can't be some browser addon that's going mental?
[21:19:25] <benibr> yes I tested with firefox and chrome, both without special config
[21:19:43] <benibr> without LDAP i can't reproduce right now
[21:21:25] <bookworm> same VM?
[21:21:40] <bookworm> and if you toggle back to ldap the error starts appearing?
[21:26:10] <benibr> same VM. after reenabling ldap, with new login in private window: duplicate messages
[21:29:11] <bookworm> ok, that narrows down the bug at least
[21:29:26] <benibr> also doesn't matter if the account is created manually or created from a ldap login
[21:29:28] <bookworm> also explains somewhat why no one complained

[21:58:24] <FergusL> Hey, has anyone made some kind of "notify" or "friend" list in The Lounge ?
[21:58:38] <FergusL> either with a plugin? I would be interested in a bot that does that, too*
[21:59:26] *** Joins: toffefe (~soyuz64@78.96.147.213)
[21:59:39] <toffefe> Hi, guys!
[22:00:32] <bookworm> not that I know of no, what do you want the friendlist to do?
[22:01:13] <FergusL> bookworm notify when users are online or offline
[22:01:59] <bookworm> notify as in real notifications? That sounds noisy or useless, depending on whether they use a bouncer or not
[22:02:05] <FergusL> I just noted that an open query window will log "away" and "back" status changes,but I don't know if these events are broadcast in some way
[22:02:19] <bookworm> better might be the away status if the network supports it
[22:02:30] <FergusL> yes without a bouncer
[22:02:46] <bookworm> they are if you share a channel
[22:03:04] <bookworm> if not, you need to query the network (which is possible up to a point)
[22:03:58] <FergusL> I actually already use the Friends List feature in HexChat but that works only when I'm on my computer, not while away on the phone
[22:04:05] <FergusL> yes using the /whois command I guess ?

[22:08:39] <bookworm> no https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/monitor
[22:08:55] <bookworm> or away_notify if you share a channel with them
[22:09:10] <bookworm> which isn't necessarily the case so monitor
[22:10:20] <bookworm> and monitor can't do away so https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/extended-monitor tries to remedy that but it's in draft
[22:10:47] <FergusL> thanks bookworm, that helps! can I leverage that using the bot then?
[22:10:53] <FergusL> using a bot*
[22:10:59] <FergusL> custom written, that is
[22:11:29] <bookworm> sure
[22:13:46] <FergusL> ok, thanks. so it's a long shot but if you write bots yourself, what do you use or recommend? I'm used to python but was surprised I didn't find any particularly outstanding library in that language
[22:17:27] <bookworm> there's a framework for absolutely every language out there
[22:17:46] <bookworm> for python, you can add it to limnoria probably
[22:19:48] <Baphomet> Hello there! Is there any current existing setting to change the CTCP reply?
[22:20:09] <Baphomet> More specifically, the CTCP VERSION
[22:20:29] <xnaas> Only by editing the source code and recompiling yourself, Baphomet
[22:20:45] <bookworm> that or znc as a proxy
[22:21:04] <bookworm> a bit heavy handed if you just want to inhibit ctcp though
[22:21:06] <xnaas> ah right, znc lets you change that to anything, eh
[22:22:05] <Baphomet> Okay! How hard do you think it'd be to someone who doesn't know TheLounge's code to add a setting option for customized CTCP reply? 
[22:22:06] <xnaas> FergusL: I use and like Sopel, but haven't ever thought about or tried what you want. :P
[22:22:29] <FergusL> bookworm I guess I probably didn't look very well :) "supybot" definitely rings a bell -- limnoria being a continuation of it, I simply forgot I guess
[22:22:31] <bookworm> 5min of work Baphomet 
[22:22:34] <FergusL> Ha! will check it out too, thanks
[22:22:58] <Baphomet> Okay, and do you think it's a desirable new feature?
[22:23:03] <bookworm> alas ot would not be accepted upstream
[22:25:13] <bookworm> hah, actually it wasn't outright rejected https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/1344
[22:25:23] <bookworm> configuring the logo was, my bad
[22:28:17] <bookworm> johncs: MaxLeiter what do you think about https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/1344 ? Valid thing to have or not? How would it look like for all other ctcp queries (but action) ? Too many knobs for not much gain?
[22:28:32] <Baphomet> Ohh, so there are more people interested? 
[22:28:39] <bookworm> usually yes
[22:28:51] <bookworm> btw your patch is already linked in the issue
[22:28:59] <bookworm> not pretty but it might work

[22:30:32] <Baphomet> I noticed it right now

[22:30:58] <Baphomet> I'll se if there were a pull-request
[22:31:28] <Baphomet> xnaas: I used to put "Go CTCP your mom" in the clients I used before
[22:31:31] <Baphomet> LOL
[22:31:37] <xnaas> 😏

[22:32:18] <Baphomet> By the way, why random people would, from time to time, CTCP the others? 
[22:32:25] <bookworm> why not?
[22:32:26] <Baphomet> I find that very uncomfortable
[22:32:44] <bookworm> why? people also whois you randomly
[22:32:52] <bookworm> or look at your host mask
[22:33:06] <Baphomet> Indeed they do

[22:34:18] <Baphomet> I'd be totally okay if people, for instance, were researching IRC client usage, for instance, but asked first
[22:34:39] <bookworm> at least you're properly updated 😛
[22:35:00] <Baphomet> As always LOL
[22:35:23] <bookworm> now for the fun part, do it to me too 😉
[22:35:26] <Baphomet> Okay, that was in the context of a conversation LOL 
[22:36:10] <Baphomet> Did you suppress yours?
[22:36:13] <bookworm> yes
[22:36:31] <Baphomet> Wise

[22:40:41] <Baphomet> Do you think people would believe if I returned mIRC on VERSION?
[22:41:00] <xnaas> sure, why not
[22:41:23] <Baphomet> It was intended as a joke 
[22:41:29] <xnaas> They might start making fun of you for paying $20 though
[22:41:31] <bookworm> usually is
[22:41:31] <xnaas> ;P
[22:42:29] <bookworm> in my view I'd just disable all ctcp commands but action (/me) they serve no purpose
[22:42:40] <Baphomet> They should, I mean, considering currency conversion from BRL 20 dollars is A LOT of money
[22:43:04] <Baphomet> I used to like /me
[22:43:14] * xnaas agrees that everything other than /me seems useless
[22:43:38] <Baphomet> In the times of broader IRC usave where IRC was kind of a social media
[22:44:08] <bookworm> used to? ctcp action is what xnaas just sent
[22:44:45] * xnaas thinks Baphomet just isn't into it anymore

[22:46:57] <xnaas> But yeah, I'd approve of a PR that disables all non-/me CTCPs :P
[22:47:02] <xnaas> (optionally, of course)
[22:47:11] <Baphomet> Ohhh, this browser window was in my second screen where I don't see much of yello in the bottom

[22:48:59] <Baphomet> I found out that these days auto-away messages are considered a bad thing, even when it's one single discrete message
[22:49:41] <Baphomet> There was a time they were like super used, at least in my country's main networks

[22:52:53] <Baphomet> Does anyone know the history of other CTCP commands? I mean, some of them I understand, if I'm not mistaken they were used establishing DCC transfers, right? But, version? Why would anyone think "heyy, let's add it to the protocol"
[22:53:05] <bookworm> ctcp action doesn't mean away message, just generally formated in a way so that people can talk about themselves in the third person
[22:53:31] * Baphomet is aware
[22:53:41] <bookworm> for fun and profit. You'd be amazed how often it's helpful in #libera
[22:54:03] <bookworm> also, let's take this to -offtopic else bookworm bans me
[22:54:09] <serp> It's for judging others on their client of choice.. or was in the 90's
[22:54:36] <Baphomet> serp: LOL I remember people did that a lot
[22:55:15] <Baphomet> People liked that BitchX thing... I hated that and was more into epic
[22:55:35] <bookworm> Baphomet: join us in #thelounge-offtopic

[23:45:31] <MaxLeiter> bookworm: I think its time for a settings overhaul and thats the only way I could see it implemented 
[23:45:51] <bookworm> settings overhaul as in make it tabbed by categories?
[23:45:59] <bookworm> or what did you have in mind?
