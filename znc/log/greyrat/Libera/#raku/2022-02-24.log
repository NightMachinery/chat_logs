[00:56:05] <moon-child> damn ... I think I will have to switch away from raku for my assembler's testrunner
[00:56:24] <moon-child> too slow.  Even threaded, it takes quite a long time
[00:56:47] <moon-child> (granted this is generating nearly 50mb of test cases)
[00:57:54] <MasterDuke> have any short example case we can profile?
[01:06:05] <moon-child> well, hmm.  Now I am confused.  If I only make it generate the test cases, it takes about 10 seconds; if I only make it run the tests, it takes about 8 seconds.  There is no way that should take 8 seconds; it takes just under a second if I run them manually from the shell
[01:08:16] <moon-child> so maybe there is contention somewhere with starting processes?

[08:45:49] <japhb> Apropos of previous discussion about Data::MessagePack, I've added support for it (and also the MessagePack decode-only module) to serializer-perf (https://raku.land/zef:japhb/App::SerializerPerf).  At the moment its tests can cause Rakudo/MoarVM to throw some very interesting errors, and I can't try on latest Rakudo until File::Directory::Tree is working again.

[16:04:59] <lizmat> so no, today is not a good day  :-(
[16:05:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> aww :c
[16:07:44] <lizmat> I was born in the year Russia invaded Hungary
[16:09:12] <lizmat> and distinctly remember Russia invading Czechoslovakia in 1968, basically lifting Dubcek from power
[16:09:29] <lizmat> it looks like last night they tried the same with Zelensky, but failed

[16:15:19] <El_Che> Well, Putin's party is according to their manifest Russian conservative and nationalist, so that I can understand
[16:15:52] <El_Che> where it's get funny is how the far right in Twitter is celebrating Putin's "anti-wokeness"

[16:16:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what does that have to do with white male dominance again...
[16:16:25] <lizmat> that's not funny... that's part of the same mind-set

[16:17:44] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> if anything, this narrative caused damage

[16:18:13] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It's so overwhelmingly counterfactual to most people that many people will side with those who just oppose it

[16:21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I think wokeness is a legitimate ideological problem that is so bizarre to many people (possibly the majority) that you should seriously think whether it's useful to label everyone far-right who doesn't roll with it
[16:21:52] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> The thing is more like, we should just stop talking about it for a minute or two, and turn our attention to something... more important
[16:23:05] <El_Che> Nemokosch#9980: the examples we metion (FVD in NL) and Bannon are not far-right because they fixation on "woke". They present the all enchilada
[16:23:49] * El_Che programming for a bit; afk
[16:24:34] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't know what "all the enchilada" is, I only know that everyone who doesn't welcome mass migration, gay marriage and the likes tend to be automatically called "far right"
[16:52:17] <lizmat> El_Che: it's hard
[16:53:07] <lizmat> and why would one not want to support "gay marriage" ?

[19:06:51] <nine> Nemokosch#9980: I am married (heterosecually) and both of us are decidedly unreligious and we do not have children. People like us make your argument moot. The debate is strictly about the legal+economical institution. Religions (all several thousands of them) may define their own rituals in their way.
[19:09:06] <nine> Nemokosch#9980: people who endorse far right positions will have to live with being labled far-right. If that bothers them, they can always re-think their positions. Getting labled that way may just be a wake up call that someone has lost their way. That's ok. We all make decisions that we'd rather change later.
[19:10:19] *** Joins: squashable6 (squ-able@2001:41d0:2:5eb5::)
[19:19:23] <patrickb[]> I think a big part of the difficulty of the marriage discussion is not being clear about the "strictly about the legal+economical institution" part. The "define marriage" bit is missing I many discussions I have observed. It's made more difficult by there actually being discussions and controvercies of same-sex marriage (the religious sort) in multiple large churches.
[19:20:27] <lizmat> to me, not allowing two people to get married when they want to be, is a very basic form of discrimination
[19:21:39] <lizmat> if two people pledge to take care of each other, there should be no legal barrier preventing just that
[19:22:18] <lizmat> and any other type of legal agreement that doesn't carry the same benefits as a legal marriage, is a stopgap measure at best
[19:22:38] <[Coke]> If you have a problem with the religious approval of some marriages, take it up with your church. If you have a problem with the civil aspect... tough. Making sure everyone has rights doesn't take away your rights.
[19:22:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> > People like us make your argument moot. The debate is strictly about the legal+economical institution
[19:22:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I'm not sure if it's required to use the term "marriage" then. I'm not sure if there is much meaning in calling your relation "marriage" either but I don't see how that turns into an argument for "gay marriage", or why it even should
[19:23:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> >  people who endorse far right positions will have to live with being labled far-right. If that bothers them, they can always re-think their positions
[19:23:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> okay, I will try to help you understand the problem
[19:23:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> take someone from the woke culture and say
[19:24:23] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> "people who endorse marxist positions will have to live with being labelled marxist. If that bothers them, they can always re-think their positions"
[19:26:20] * lizmat goes silent again
[19:26:40] <patrickb[]> [Coke]: I agree.
[19:26:48] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> it's not really constructive to define people who don't follow _your_ particular value system as the bogeyman of your ideology

[19:29:45] * patrickb[] fears the possibility of this discussion escalating, but is hopefull as #raku tends to be good at coping with difficult discussions.
[19:32:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't know why remarks of "white male supremacy" are required about the Russian offensive
[19:33:01] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Anyway, I pointed out a typo and an abusable part of the code of conduct
[19:33:21] <[Coke]> what's the typo, sorry?
[19:33:48] <perryprog> Re CoC: I feel it's pretty blatantly obvious that the idea of same-gender marriage not being okay legally/civilly/whateverly is quite against the CoC, and correctly so, so I'm not sure why we keep coming back to that portion of the conversation.
[19:34:08] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> there was an "exiting" instead of an "existing" somewhere
[19:34:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Well there should be nothing obvious about it
[19:34:42] <[Coke]> If you could open a ticket (or submit a PR) or the typo, that'd be great.
[19:34:51] <perryprog> I got it [Coke]

[19:35:26] <Geth> ¦ Raku-Steering-Council: review: https://github.com/Raku/Raku-Steering-Council/pull/47
[19:36:26] <perryprog> I mean, it's not really an abusable part of the CoC, in my opinion. It's a guideline, not a DnD ruleset that needs to be followed to the most literal level humanly possible.
[19:36:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Where I can find the Raku "community guidelines"? (I made 2 min search with Google without getting anything that explicitly states them ...)
[19:36:46] <perryprog> it's https://github.com/Raku/Raku-Steering-Council/blob/main/papers/code_of_conduct.md
[19:36:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> The problem is that those people who consistently stand up for freedom of speech and opinion eventually end up with the whole skinhead/diehard anti-semitic conspiracist part of the internet
[19:37:44] <perryprog> I'm not sure I get what point that generalization is trying to make, sorry
[19:38:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> but in my opinion, that's no reason for legalizing virtual inquisition
[19:38:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @perryprog Thanks! (Should have read more carefully the messages above...)
[19:38:22] <perryprog> np
[19:38:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I think I quoted that part but I will look it up again
[19:39:27] <[Coke]> In my experience, people complaining about being lumped in with the nazis should try doing less nazi stuff. It's not that "the woke left" is picking a bad name to call them based on nothing. But this is way off topic. If you have something specific to add about the COC, great.
[19:39:40] <[Coke]> If you don't want to follow the CoC, that's also fine, but then you can leave.
[19:40:13] <[Coke]> And having dropped that... back to $dayjob here for a while. Good luck, woke leftie marxists, keep fighting the good fight.
[19:40:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> This link is broken: https://github.com/Raku/Raku-Steering-Council/blob/main/papers/CoC
[19:40:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> >  For instance, the Raku community would be neither inclusive nor enjoyable if it welcomed people who post racist screeds to their personal sites, no matter how assiduously they attempted to separate those statements from their Raku activities.
[19:40:20] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I get that this sounds like rightful elimination of all evil to those who are living with this mindset
[19:40:42] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> But this seems quite creepy a couple of lines under talking about "stalking"
[19:41:05] <perryprog> I don't follow. What's your issue with that statement?
[19:42:24] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Mainly that it's noone's business what someone holds "separate"
[19:43:26] <perryprog> That's not true, and the justification is right there. If I started hosting a Neo-nazi white supremacy blog then it doesn't matter what I'm doing here
[19:43:54] <guifa> The idea is quite simple (and I guess we've already been Godwin'd): it doesn't matter how technically amazing at Raku that Hitler was, he wouldn't be welcome.  No Jew, Roma, or LGBT member would feel remotely safe in Raku spaces.
[19:44:20] <perryprog> ^^
[19:44:28] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Do you pose this as an axiom or do you have something for it?
[19:44:59] * perryprog is done with this convo
[19:45:19] <perryprog> Just have to step out, sorry
[19:46:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> But as we all know, it's not really realistic having to deal with a stereotypical Hitler image in the Raku community
[19:46:32] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @guifa This is sort of a related discussion: https://linux.slashdot.org/story/22/02/23/0537213/reiserfs-proposed-to-be-removed-from-linux-in-2022
[19:46:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Therefore I don't think this analogy can be applied to the real-life scenario
[19:46:33] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @guifa This is sort of a related discussion: https://linux.slashdot.org/story/22/02/23/0537213/reiserfs-proposed-to-be-removed-from-linux-in-2022
[19:47:21] <[Coke]> one of the unacceptable behaviors, btw, is "Continuing or repeatedly starting a conversation in an inappropriate venue (for example, debating the merits of a Code of Conduct violation in the general #raku IRC channel rather than in the appropriate GitHub issue or repeated off-topic conversations in #raku-dev)."
[19:48:05] <[Coke]> So please, if you have an issue with the substance of the COC - please free free to open a ticket.
[19:49:42] <lizmat> discord-raku-bot: help
[19:53:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It's more than ironic to add something like this to the Code of Conduct
[19:55:18] <[Coke]> Again, please open a ticket.
[19:55:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I think we are having an appropriate conversation but okay, will do that
[19:56:18] <[Coke]> I do not.
[19:56:30] <[Coke]> Thanks for wrapping it up.
[19:58:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> anyways, COC aside, it's important that people are sometimes confronted with their beliefs so that they don't start forming bubbles
[19:59:15] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I hope we can agree on that at least
[20:00:47] <japhb> Nemokosch, it's not your job to confront people, and especially not on this channel.  STOP.
[20:01:52] <[Coke]> I suggest searching for the paradox of tolerance.
[20:03:04] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I know that and it's often deliberately misunderstood

[20:07:22] <japhb> Nemokosch: You do not need to get the last word in.  You do not win an argument by continuing to talk.  Leaders of the community have asked you to stop.  Just.  Stop.  Talking.  (DON NOT REPLY.)
[20:09:16] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> But you surely do win it by keeping this aggressive tone...

[20:28:31] <m_athias> Are there, apart from the CoC, any guidelines on offtopic discussions? If #raku keeps on growing maybe a #raku-casual channel might be appropriate. Various communities established -casual channels/subreddits/etc where discussion that fits the environment but is considered offtopic can take place.
[20:30:37] <japhb> m_athias: We have spawned a few channels over the years for things that only some of the audience was interested in, such as particular frameworks, or Raku folk interested in talking about gaming, or what have you.

[20:32:01] <japhb> But: the way that Libera.chat works, the raku org owns any channel that begins with #raku-, so we can't make a channel named #raku-<something> that is counter to the CoC.
[20:34:16] <m_athias> Just in case: I was not trying to start a channel that is counter to the CoC. While I have strong opinions on some of the issues raised above I, try to, keep politics/religion/etc "at the door". 
[20:36:28] <japhb> m_athias: Oh, wasn't assuming you were wanting to do that.  I was just explaining why there's no channel for Raku folk who want to focus on politics and religion.  :-)

And endow that ML classifier with a Cro web service, so people can use it from any location to verify, check, and self-censor their potential posts in Raku channels or personal blogs.
[20:59:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> 😂
[21:00:57] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> anyway, there is <#538435064116281365> on discord but most people don't seem to be using discord in this community
[21:00:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> so it cannot really fulfill a purpose
[21:00:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Sent the issue to RSC
[21:00:58] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> and gotta go now

[23:11:20] <[Coke]> if I install "File::Directory::Tree", and then use zef list --installed, I get File::Directory::Tree:auth<labster>
[23:11:49] <[Coke]> but if I uninstall it, and then try 'zef install "File::Directory::Tree"', I get "no candidates found matching..."
[23:12:18] <[Coke]> seems to work with File::Temp:ver<0.0.10>:auth<zef:rbt> though
[23:12:48] <[Coke]> er, "and then try" was with File::Directory::Tree:auth<labster>
[23:22:58] <[Coke]> (trying to pass the working one through a powershell invocation of zef then also results in 'no candidates found', crud.
[23:25:04] <ugexe> what if you use single quotes instead
[23:27:00] <[Coke]> fixed powershell issue, but the failure to find the :auth<labster> one seems problematic.
[23:27:02] <ugexe> ah File::Directory::Tree doesn't have an explicit auth set
[23:27:08] <ugexe> it has 'author'
[23:27:35] <ugexe> which does get treated as 'auth' in some cases, but thats an old -ism from before 6c
[23:28:32] <[Coke]> ok. so, not worth fixing in zef, open a ticket with the module?
[23:28:39] <ugexe> yeah
[23:29:18] *** Joins: ismustac1 (~ismustach@191.96.170.16)
[23:29:38] <ugexe> i should probably remove those remaining author/authority as auth remnants in zef one of these days tho
[23:30:00] <ugexe> so `zef list --installed` doesn't show you File::Directory::Tree:auth<labster>

[23:44:58] <[Coke]> .seen labster
[23:44:59] <tellable6> [Coke], I saw labster 2018-09-17T03:39:31Z in #perl6: <labster> Man, this is fun, I haven't found a segfault in MoarVM in like 5 years!
[23:45:17] <[Coke]> and that was 5 years ago!
[23:45:35] <japhb> I was about to say, "Meanwhile, 3.5 years later ..."
[23:45:37] <nine> That....makes me think I'm doing something wrong :D

[23:57:49] <[Coke]> sweet. Have a powershell script that does a hard reinstall on windows (assumes a LOT) but takes the x-step process and reduces it to a single command. (including re-installing the modules with zef)
[23:58:26] <[Coke]> only useful for people who are maybe, say, doing a git bisect on windows.
