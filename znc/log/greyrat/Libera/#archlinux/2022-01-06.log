[03:32:07] <luigibu> or any other chat client?
[03:32:27] <kevr> there's a long history of irc being home for some of these things because they just decentralize where their networks are hosted

[03:40:40] <BrainDamage> pps peripherial is pretty much just raising edge every 1s
[03:41:02] <BrainDamage> as long as you can use the serial, you should get the data
[03:41:36] <jayray> I've tried on 2 separate boxes, one is a fresh install
[03:41:39] <MrElendig> did you check that you are actually getting the signal as I suggested the other day?
[03:41:41] <jayray> same results
[03:42:03] <BrainDamage> so rather than debug it as a pps device, try debugging it as it was a reg serial
[03:42:06] <jayray> MrElendig I've done a lot of troubleshooting since then. what was the test?
[03:42:45] <BrainDamage> if ppscheck throws messages with 1s interval, then they are getting the signal
[03:42:54] <jayray> it is

[03:45:41] <MrElendig> jayray: ebay/ali special logic analyser is handy to keep in the bag
[03:45:44] <BrainDamage> is it on a db9 connector?
[03:45:54] <jayray> BrainDamage: yes
[03:46:45] <BrainDamage> grab a led and a resistor and you can diy your logic visualiser
[03:46:55] <BrainDamage> since it's only a 1s signal
[03:47:24] <kevr> ive been doing that with everything lately
[03:47:25] <BrainDamage> you might have to add a regg diode in series
[03:47:32] <jayray> *there is a 1 sec pulsing led on the gps itself :|
[03:47:32] <kevr> so ez and so useful

[03:48:40] <BrainDamage> again, it says the pps is on cts

[03:49:28] <jayray> lmc if I can rig something up
[03:49:41] <BrainDamage> I'd check if the pps is on DTE/DCE
[03:51:43] <BrainDamage> sending pps with hw flow control strobes both cts and dte/dce

[09:31:48] <driftingstranger> is there a way to both prune duplicates, and also have separate sessions all recording history?

[09:37:05] <tirnanog> driftingstranger: so, when bash starts, you can think of it as performing an implicit "history -r". that is, HISTFILE is opened, parsed and the contents appended to the (in-memory) history list. it would make perfect sense to perform the de-duplication at that point, if a user so desired. unfortunately, as I've just discovered, setting erasedups has no effect on the behaviour of history -r.
[09:37:12] <driftingstranger> Betal: but then my history won't be saved if there is another terminal open, where bash exits later

[10:05:07] <tirnanog> driftingstranger: in any case, bash does also support HISTFILESIZE.
[10:05:25] <tirnanog> remember, the history has to be parsed either way.
[10:05:31] <driftingstranger> true
[10:06:16] <tirnanog> so de-duplication would increase memory usage until the procedure is done, in a fashion that scales with the number of entries that need to be parsed.
[10:06:30] <driftingstranger> Betal: only 1 'echo a' and 1 'echo b', as expected
[10:06:30] <tirnanog> I really can't see that being much of a problem in the typical case.
[10:07:07] <driftingstranger> tirnanog: sounds like a sound feature request
[10:07:19] <tirnanog> I mean, as long as it's optional.
[10:07:21] <tirnanog> yeah.

[10:08:37] <Betal> driftingstranger: as expected if you have erasedups (only 2 echo's)
[10:10:33] <driftingstranger> it only gets complicated if there are parallel sessions
[10:10:49] <llua> disk space is too cheap to care about duplicate lines in a text file.
[10:11:30] <Betal> but when it polute your control-r, it matters ;)
[10:12:11] <driftingstranger> llua: true :))
[10:12:23] <driftingstranger> Betal: exactly
[10:12:31] <llua> until you try to recall how you did something, look at your histfile and is confused with how something one since one of the events was a dup, thus being erased for a event later on
[10:12:47] <llua> something work*
[10:13:24] <tirnanog> different folks, different strokes. it mattered enough to have erasedups and ignoredups in the first place. personally, I unset HISTFILE on most machines.
[10:13:30] <driftingstranger> llua: good point, i still like to keep the history tidy though
[10:13:45] <driftingstranger> tirnanog: why?
[10:14:02] <llua> i don't use it either normally
[10:14:05] <driftingstranger> tirnanog: do you just not use history?
[10:14:16] <tirnanog> driftingstranger: in most cases, I have no need of it. note that the history list still works within a given instance of bash.
[10:14:40] <tirnanog> in any case, my point was that different people like to go about things in different ways.
[10:14:52] <driftingstranger> i actually use ignorespace a lot
[10:14:59] <tirnanog> arguing that it's merely about the size of HISTFILE doesn't really stand up.
[10:15:07] <driftingstranger> true
[10:15:12] <tirnanog> (it's not)
[10:15:33] <tirnanog> I mean, if it were, that's what HISTFILESIZE is for.
[10:18:27] <driftingstranger> tirnanog: that 'unset HISTFILE' is a good idea. just added it to my .bashrc for root
[10:19:00] <tirnanog> right. it can actually be a liability in some cases.
[10:19:50] <tirnanog> it works better if you do HISTFILESIZE=0 first. then bash will helpfully truncate the HISTFILE for you, in case it was populated.
[10:20:53] <driftingstranger> i just deleted it

[10:26:34] <Ghosthree3> driftingstranger: idk if you got your answer but when i tested the bash no dupes thing i found it only erased sequential dupes. ie. typing  ls twice would get sqashed to one ls but if you did ls cd ls it would keep both ls. if you want better deduped history consider zsh (which is the better choice anyway)

[14:55:25] <crendel> I have systemd-networkd fully managing my networking, with one .network file for a local ethernet connection and one for wireguard. I'm setting the [Route] section explicitly in the wireguard .network file (but omitting it for the ethernet .network, the interface that should have the default route). As of a couple weeks ago (not sure of which systemd and kernel versions; the machine was offline for several weeks before I updated today), the 
[14:55:25] <crendel> routing table had been populated as expected for months, but now systemd-networkd is creating an additional default route for the wireguard connection whenever I bring the wg interface up (so there are two default routes). Setting DefaultRouteOnDevice explicitly to false also changes nothing. Any ideas of some update to systemd-networkd that might have resulted in the change to this behavior and how to address it (other than removing routes 
[14:55:27] <crendel> with `ip`)?

[21:41:27] <MrElendig> or just update it as it gets updated in aur
[21:41:45] <Furai> Still I don't quite follow, is there any version I can just download from them? Bear in mind that I was ubuntu user up till 1 week ago so I was only ever using debs.
[21:41:56] <Furai> And sometimes compiling from source.
[21:42:17] <MrElendig> its the same on ubuntu

[21:43:53] <Furai> So I can just probably run it whenever insiders complains there's update.
[21:43:56] <Furai> Anyway, thx.
