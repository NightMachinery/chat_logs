[00:16:08] <Sqaure> Idk if its my limited perspective, having worked for 20 years on only 3 places that had designated "software architects" or if the role is vague. At one place we had a clear genius. Id believe hed be top of the crop within mensa. So he was just very smart and effective. At my current place we have a more human one that is basically mostly beeing a project leader / product owner type. He cant take any meaningful technical decisions as he lacks insight 
[00:16:08] <Sqaure> because lack of coding. 
[00:18:21] <superflaknet92> "architect" sounds like just another manager that doesn't do any rea l work
[00:18:24] <Sqaure> How does the career paths look at your work places? Do you have similar experience with the more human "software architect" thats more a communication hub than someone able to take techical decisions? 
[00:19:55] *** Joins: bolsonarogay (~bolsonaro@186.237.242.64)
[00:20:10] <Sqaure> Is there a name for the one(s) in a group that take technical decisions or is flat hierachies the way most people roll these days?  
[00:21:18] <InPhase> Sqaure: I don't know the overall statistics, and I suspect it would vary by subfield, but my general impression is that for the most part software architects are more senior and experienced programmers who have demonstrated the capacity to reason well about the big pictures of software, and who have the experience to offer guidance and make good decisions about what overall architectural choices 
[00:21:24] <InPhase> will result in better code.

[00:22:57] <InPhase> Sqaure: I think a more appropriate title is Software Manager otherwise.  "Architect" is a title that specifically designates a particular skill.  Of course, the appropriateness of that title depends on the astuteness of the upper level people who assign the title to a person.
[00:23:06] <Sqaure> ...snf hes an average developer at best
[00:23:28] <Sqaure> and*
[00:23:39] <InPhase> Sqaure: Well, I manage a team, and there is a lot of code that I help design and offer architectural guidance on that I also don't touch with my own typing.

[00:25:29] <Sqaure> InPhase, i dont expect the role to be able to do more than 50% coding, but total detachment from it feels a bit odd to me.
[00:25:50] <InPhase> Sqaure: But I can only do that because I've written and designed so much code already.  I rely on them to competently explain the issues to me, with follow-up questions, that I am usually not looking at myself.  Sometimes I will examine particular bits of code if I detect confusion, but then I generally offer a solution path instead of what exactly to type.
[00:26:50] <Sqaure> The place you come from and the way you seem to operate sounds more in line with my expectations of the role.  
[00:28:16] <InPhase> Sqaure: I still do coding, but because my team is not huge.  If I were doing this for a larger team, I would probably write very little code out myself at work.  It's possible for me to create code faster with an hour of giving good advice to a competent programmer than for me to spend an hour typing, in most cases.  There are pieces I end up doing myself because I am the sole holder of the 
[00:28:22] <InPhase> necessary experience or background, but with a larger team I would hire on more people with that background, and again, I could get more done with advice.

[04:48:53] <edgar-rft> yes, for building you need the -dev package, too
[04:48:59] <[itchyjunk]> i need both? 
[04:49:02] *** Joins: flaknet99 (~0x100@32.211.211.39)
[04:49:34] <[itchyjunk]> ah i was only missing dev one
[04:50:27] <edgar-rft> usually the -dev package installs the binary packages automatically, but only the -dev package contains the header files you need for building other software that is using libpixman
[04:51:04] *** ephemer0l is now known as GeneralDiscourse
[04:52:05] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[04:52:11] <[itchyjunk]> header file, this is C lingo?
[04:52:31] <[itchyjunk]> or is `import util.java.shit` also a header file?
[04:53:08] <flaknet99> LOL and it happened exavctly at 5.2  https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/5.2
[04:53:11] <bayaz> Title: ChangeLog/5.2 - QEMU 
[04:53:46] <flaknet99> switched to meson
[04:53:57] <edgar-rft> [itchyjunk]: the -dev package contains all the definitions the compiler needs to know, in C it's the header files, in other languages they may be called something different
[04:54:05] <flaknet99> as far as i'm concerned "switched to meson" is now a canary
[04:54:58] <[itchyjunk]> definition like actual definitions? #define A 1 etc?
[04:55:24] <[itchyjunk]> wow make takes forever
[04:55:31] <[itchyjunk]> it's just on 400 of 10k?
[04:55:34] <[itchyjunk]> zzz
[04:55:39] <flaknet99> they also removed riscv from default build list among many other arches
[04:55:43] <flaknet99> so you have to add the option manually
[04:56:18] <flaknet99> no wait i misread, its unicore32 and lm32
[04:56:43] <[itchyjunk]> i have to do what!
[04:56:51] <[itchyjunk]> hopefully i am building the right thing
[04:56:59] <[itchyjunk]> else i will commit sudoku
[04:56:59] <flaknet99> Python 3.6 or newer is now required to build QEMU.
[04:57:01] <flaknet99> looooooooooool
[04:58:11] <flaknet99> tey switch to meson, add 2x bloat to the COMPRESSED source, and require ninja + python 3.6
[04:58:26] <[itchyjunk]> and pixman
[04:58:28] <flaknet99> i cannot support this software anymore  i'm pretty bummed about this
[04:58:29] <[itchyjunk]> w/e that is
[04:58:33] <Izem> meson requires python
[04:58:42] <[itchyjunk]> make your own emulator of riscV!
[04:58:43] <flaknet99> does it require ninja?
[04:58:46] <[itchyjunk]> maybe people will dl it
[04:58:59] <Izem> yeah it uses ninja as well

[05:13:45] <flaknet99> the assembly can just pretend to be a C funcition  BUT it's not technically portable

[13:29:13] <nromsas>  is anyone capable of writing powershell script? would require to run a command to bruteforce password from a list, program overwrites the original file, then script needs to add .uha extension to the file and run the bruteforce again until 100 iterations are done

[13:34:39] <DnzAtWrk> accumulator += duty_cycle; if (accumulator >= 1) { turn_on(); accumulator--; } else { turn_off(); }
[13:34:42] <DnzAtWrk> maybe this is clearer

[13:37:31] <DnzAtWrk> and the performance difference is insignificant

[13:38:20] <jtgd> I think if you did -- on a float, and it didn't complain, it might actually convert float to int, decrement, and convert back to float.
[13:38:30] <DnzAtWrk> hmm
[13:38:35] <DnzAtWrk> it may actually need rounding

[13:39:15] <DnzAtWrk> and so on

[14:44:59] <arahael> locky: Not realy, imho.
[14:45:10] <locky> I usually use UUIDs as passwords.
[14:45:45] <locky> I used to generate 512-bit long alphanumeric ones, but that length is rejected in too many places.
[14:45:46] <arahael> Sometimes it makes sense to have a maximum length to ensure that you can check passwords in constant time.  Otherwise, an attacker could get addidtional information if the time required varies on length
[14:46:09] <locky> with unicode nothing is constant
[14:46:19] <arahael> locky: 64 bytes isn't that long at all, however.
[14:46:28] <locky> except when your db has size-limited fields 
[14:46:40] <locky> but then you are limited in a more "natural" way
[14:46:50] <arahael> locky: Unicode has nothing to do once you've got teh password.
[14:47:05] <arahael> At that point, you really just have a byte string.
[14:47:30] <locky> I am saying that you can still fool your length-checking system if it is counting the number of symbols
[14:47:42] <locky> not the number of bytes

[19:20:59] <[itchyjunk]> Like "test driven development" ?
[19:21:26] <The_Blode> Yes it's a serious question. What makes you think it's not?
[19:21:47] <Izem> just checking, it has meme potential
[19:21:47] <The_Blode> Hey itchy, I'm not sure. They were saying Agile development / scrum.
[19:22:05] <The_Blode> I've only been programming for 4 years and as far as I know, I've not been doing Agile.
[19:22:19] <pyzozord> TheBlode: It's development process. You work on small tasks that are called "user stories", in 2-week periods called "sprints". After each one you'll have a "retrospective" meeting discussing what happend in last sprint, and a "planning" meeting to decide on the user stories for the next sprint. There is also a "grooming" meeting dedicated to refining user stories where developers ask questions 
[19:22:21] <The_Blode> I've been basically working on tickets, updating the trunk, releasing, then repeating.
[19:22:25] <pyzozord> about each storie to find out more about it. Oh also during planing there you'll must estimate the user stories, that's usually done with fibonaci numbers tshirt sizes.
[19:22:38] <pyzozord> That's the gits, you can find out more on google
[19:22:39] *** Quits: job (~job@wikimedia-commons/pandakekok9) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:22:52] <[itchyjunk]> lol grooming meetings
[19:22:54] <pyzozord> yeah so you know most of it
[19:23:29] <The_Blode> That sounds a lot different to how I'm developing now
[19:23:34] <pyzozord> if your boss is really serious about scrum you'll be doing "sprints" and "groomings" and "plannings"
[19:23:54] <The_Blode> I don't know if the product I'm working on will even work with this process
[19:24:02] <The_Blode> Since the product has bug fixes a lot
[19:24:04] <pyzozord> most bosses don't care though and do it badly
[19:24:24] <The_Blode> Can bug fixing be done in Agile?
[19:24:35] <The_Blode> It sounds more like a features thing
[19:24:51] <pyzozord> yes, you will have "definition of ready" and "definiton of done"
[19:24:54] <The_Blode> Let me copy and paste what you wrote so I can re-read it
[19:25:03] <pyzozord> "definition of done" will usually say that the user story must be bug free
[19:25:26] <[itchyjunk]> Professional programming sounds horrible
[19:26:18] <khanred> :D
[19:26:18] <pyzozord> scrum is a lightweight methodology, there are much more horrible and beurocratic out there
[19:26:27] <khanred> Jobs in general suck

Just watch few youtube videos to get an idea how this goes, but you don't need to remember this. Each scrum team has a "scrum master", that's sort of like a team leader that makes sure team members follow scrum

[19:31:26] <pyzozord> engineering is applying formal methods to real life problems, it's really strict

[19:41:22] <The_Blode> This creates an inbalance in the workflow.
[19:42:08] <InPhase> The_Blode: Remember that a job is more than individual work product.  Peer relationships are critical to continued functioning of the organization as a whole.  So keep attention on that in your efforts there.

[19:42:41] <The_Blode> I don't focus any effort on him.
[19:43:06] <InPhase> The_Blode: If you have strong relations and the respect of everyone else on the team, then you are secure and he looks like he can't manage.  It's pretty simple then if the people above have visibility into this.
[19:43:18] <The_Blode> He doesn't accept constructive feedback on code reviews. He gets angry and tells the manager.

[19:45:27] <The_Blode> It makes no sense, Wouldn't someone who's been working with a codebase twice as long be more knowledgable about the platform?

[19:49:17] <The_Blode> I'm just very dedicated to what I do.
[19:49:20] <InPhase> pyzozord: I will use that excuse the next time I leave a job.  I will blame it on not liking The_Blode.
[19:49:26] <The_Blode> lol
[19:49:32] <kodah> that said, if you are self-taught, as a self-taught person i will attest there are things you can be doing to make everyone around you miserable that a business will find to be "just fine"
[19:49:43] <pyzozord> The_Blode: if your annoying collegue has too much power in the company, he might commit a political murder on you :P
[19:50:14] <InPhase> pyzozord: The_Blode has been there longer, and has more specific experience.  He can win that chess game.
[19:50:17] <The_Blode> He always drops the word "murder" in conversation...it's kinda disturbing. On his 8th year anniversary, he said "People have done less for murder"
[19:50:27] <InPhase> Uh...
[19:50:38] <The_Blode> He hates the job, hates the project and hates the company.
[19:50:44] <The_Blode> I don't think I should be the one to leave.

[19:51:56] <InPhase> Well it depends on tone really.  A few jokes are fine.  But from an angry disgruntled person it could sound like a threat of violence.

[19:53:26] <The_Blode> Ah
[19:54:10] <InPhase> kodah: There is interesting mechanical engineering involved with them.
[19:54:15] <The_Blode> Thank you for letting me get that story out...it's not a programming story but it's kinda related to programmers.
[19:54:19] <kodah> InPhase: agreed
[19:54:57] <The_Blode> I was talking to HR behind the scenes just to help me cope with difficult colleague like that but they told me try to "manage up"

[19:55:22] <The_Blode> Basically, it's some kind of theory of engritiating myself to him
[19:55:53] <InPhase> kodah: I was particularly fascinated by the 3D printed gun movement.  Those are fascinating engineering steps, with unpredictable social impacts.  While professoring I used this as a course discussion topic for a course segment about societal impacts of science.
[19:56:11] <The_Blode> I am being harsh here? Consider this. We have an urgent situation. We must contact the people concerned. Do you a) send an email. b) call them.
[19:56:25] <The_Blode> Urgent being, something will happen in the next few minutes.
[19:56:59] <kodah> InPhase: oh agreed, that was fascinating stuff. that movement was a bit "too free" for me, i tend to err on the side of liking a system that requires background checks and tax stamps in return for total gun freedom.
[19:57:14] <The_Blode> Anyways, I've been suppressing the negativity as I want to be happy at work again.

[20:12:04] <jelly> is there any other relevant conversation going on that chat apart from greetings
[20:12:06] <pyzozord> is a more pronounced statement when you don't respond

[20:14:48] <The_Blode> Yeah...then I'm left wondering "Why?"
[20:14:57] <The_Blode> And sometimes the why hurts more
[20:14:58] <[itchyjunk]> so you say something and it someone doesn't respond it reflects negatively on their character?
[20:14:59] <The_Blode> So I block it out :)
[20:15:03] <[itchyjunk]> that sounds so insane to me.
[20:15:11] <jelly> on the other hand... it's work, not your social circle
[20:15:27] <The_Blode> I guess. But is greeting the other humans in your workplace really socialising?
[20:15:37] <The_Blode> I thought it was basic etiquette.

[20:16:20] <pyzozord> yes I think not responding to a basic decency (at in cultures I am familiar with: western/central european) speaks volumes
[20:16:31] <[itchyjunk]> I don't think anyone owes you a response back.
[20:16:40] <[itchyjunk]> If you are doing it because you like it, that's great and fiine.
[20:16:50] <The_Blode> No it's not because of that.
[20:16:52] <[itchyjunk]> If you start expecting something back, that's called the devils contract.
[20:16:59] <pyzozord> you don't say "good morning" because you like it
[20:17:05] <[itchyjunk]> You offer something they never asked for and now they owe you something.
[20:17:07] <pyzozord> it's not a ocd thing
[20:17:11] <The_Blode> I say good morning as i just got to work
[20:17:19] <pyzozord> you say it to acknoweledge people around you

[20:24:55] <The_Blode> I have confided in some other colleagues about it. They told me "Just keep being you"
[20:24:59] <kodah> jelly: i was a programmer on an R&D team with multiple engineering backgrounds

[23:16:08] <jeaye> Could work on anticheat for games. That's kind of the midpoint between the two.

[23:20:02] <jeaye> Cheating in a game is a game in itself. It's part of the hacker mindset.

[23:28:58] <jeaye> I used to program scripts for automating actions in Runescape (MMO). It was immensely fun, especially when they started developing anti-bot tactics and I needed to work around them. I was bored with the game itself, but I ended up getting hundreds of hours of more "gameplay" by playing the meta-game of cheating.
[23:28:59] <TheRedRipper> deniska: mm thats good

[23:50:44] <InPhase> Hash: Are you in the first year?
[23:50:46] <TheRedRipper> no ping for pong
[23:50:49] <Hash> Yes
[23:51:20] <TheRedRipper> what Univ? if you dont mind telling
[23:51:30] <InPhase> Hash: It will get more serious.  You're in the year where they need to compensate for students coming from various backgrounds.  American high schools can be very good, or very lacking.  And people from all over make it into college.
[23:51:40] <user51> GeDaMo: psychology is actually really interesting in some aspects
[23:51:49] <Hash> *nod*
[23:52:08] <pyzozord> InPhase: maybe it's also motivatoin. For me a bit like being interested in security out of self defence

[23:52:17] <GeDaMo> It is, it's just that the lectures weren't :P
[23:52:29] <Hash> I can even take the critical thiking exam today, if I wantex, no big deal, since I passed the pre assessment, the professor auto approved the exam. 
[23:52:34] <pyzozord> if I felt I cannot be lied to / fooled easily, I'd maybe be less interested in critical thinking
[23:52:45] <TheRedRipper> Hash, pyzozord, user51, InPhase, deniska, GeDaMo, i will see you all later! much love to all of you thanks for conversating :>>
[23:52:49] <user51> but i also can't really have a full heart with it. i've read cialdini's book and i can't help but feel like it's a con to some degree.
[23:52:50] <Hash> But i just want to go over the material where I didn't score so well on that screenshot, and then take preassessment again, then see how I do and then final.
[23:52:55] <Hash> <3
[23:53:04] <InPhase> pyzozord: Yeah.  If I had to design one, I would probably attempt a pure critical thinking course with case studies from media.
[23:53:06] <user51> TheRedRipper: thank you. my name is ELIZA, by the way.

[23:53:12] <Hash> Ha.
[23:53:24] <Hash> Aww he left already
[23:54:34] <InPhase> pyzozord: And I would probably emphasize that you get no points for being right.  You only get points for being right for the right reasons.  :)
[23:55:01] <pyzozord> yes people tend to ignore that last part
[23:55:35] <pyzozord> like people learning about biases and fallacies only to win arguments
[23:55:50] <pyzozord> that's missing the point, first and formost those are tools for introspection
[23:56:23] <user51> question time. is there any value in writing a program in a language that doesn't fit?
[23:56:40] <pyzozord> sure, for practice
[23:57:11] <pyzozord> like running a distance you should most certainly use a car for
[23:57:14] <user51> more specifically, i read a bit of a lisp interpreter in awk, and felt like yeah it's possible - but you also kinda miss nice features you'd have in other langs
[23:57:18] <pyzozord> like 5km :P

[23:57:35] <InPhase> user51: Yes.  First, sometimes you have to write things that don't fit well into a language in that language.  This happens a lot, so it's a necessary skill.  Second, this is important for understanding what's wrong with various languages so that you can better select the good ones for problems.
[23:58:04] <InPhase> user51: Third, doing this can sometimes surprise you and you realize a language is more adaptable than you at first thought.

[23:59:00] <Hash> I can write the same thingin php, go, python, fluently. C maybe, C++ maybe.
[23:59:13] <Hash> But I very much VERY MUCH enjoy pho.
[23:59:17] <Hash> php* I love it.
[23:59:40] <user51> InPhase: yeah, that's also interesting

[23:59:57] <user51> here's someone who went pretty far with awk
