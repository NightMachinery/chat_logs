[00:03:15] <sonny> decker: guess you don't like the syntax?
[00:03:51] <decker> it didn't even have good array indexing into the lists... I could get over (funcion args) rather than function(args) but..
[00:04:18] <decker> it looked like a great starting point - maybe these higher level things have gotten somewhere
[00:05:01] <sonny> pyzozord: I don't think a static lisp is possible at all
[00:05:25] <sonny> but, there is some things like typing annotations for lisp, like typescript

[00:08:10] <decker> (though you can assign symbols to numbers and get array elements by a name)
[00:08:34] <sonny> as for indexing, you don't need it, but it's just (list-ref list index)

[02:34:08] <nomagno> snake: Not really. The article very nicely explains how Java does not functions as first class citizens, and why it should
[02:34:09] <sonny> I know a little about programming languages tho
[02:34:10] <snake> like you ask a question, and the leader/expert avoids it
[02:34:21] <nomagno> does not treat functions*
[02:34:29] <snake> now we're talking about java as a citizen
[02:34:34] <snake> makes no sense, java is not a person, its alanguage
[02:34:53] <sonny> snake: how is message passing done in Java?
[02:34:54] <snake> ohhh ok, so because each like unit of code needs to be a class
[02:35:00] <apotheon> snake: You have yet to ask a question that is not pre-answered.
[02:35:17] <snake> yeah but you can use static functions so, i dont think its really a big issue
[02:35:22] <apotheon> Evidence suggests that additional attempts to provide answers would be similarly discarded with prejudice, prior to consideration.
[02:35:26] <snake> much ado about nothing
[02:35:51] <snake> sonny, let me think about that
[02:36:10] <sonny> well, that will provide a key insight
[02:36:19] <jkk> key to what??
[02:36:42] <snake> sonny, you can call functions, or create objects
[02:36:44] <apotheon> snake: What I think nomagno accidentally a word or two.
[02:37:06] <apotheon> One point in the article was that Java's lack of first-class functions is a significant issue with the language.
[02:37:20] <snake> apotheon, functions outside of a class?
[02:37:24] <snake> why is that an issue?
[02:37:33] <apotheon> . . . but that's far from the most singificant issue with Java mentioned in the article, so I'm not sure that's what nomagno choose as a point of focus.
[02:37:57] <apotheon> A bigger issue is indicated by the title of the article: that Java is a kingdom of nouns.
[02:38:14] <snake> so you're against.. objects

[03:43:53] <snake> of course if you limit yourself to one you might not learn as much and become well rounded
[03:44:08] <nomagno> I'm not dictating how open source is meant to work. I'm saying these projects are bigger than I am comfortable with, and cause vendor lock-in without actually having such a thing as a vendor.

[03:44:24] <snake> that's why i never got the intensity of arguing against certain languages or paradigms, tho i am susceptible to hate too, i just can't make an argument against rust
[03:44:32] <snake> sonny, yeah
[03:44:48] <sonny> gcc doesn't cause vendor lock in, that would be on your part
[03:45:30] <sonny> it you don't like gcc then sure, that's ok
[03:45:55] <nomagno> Linux, GCC, Clang... All too big to fork long-term without a huge social trigger or an insane amount of economic resources
[03:46:04] <snake> there is the "dev cycles" argument, but i have also experienced working at a place with frequent commits, and fast workers, but they keep breaking my shit (probably on prupose to make me quit in retrospect, but sometimes just cause they were working too fast and not thinking)
[03:46:32] <[itchyjunk]> why would you want to form them though?
[03:46:40] <[itchyjunk]> you'ed wanna form something small that you use
[03:46:43] <snake> so i say work slowly enough to "get it right" even if you're coding in a language (unlike rust) with potentially fast "development cycles"
[03:46:47] <[itchyjunk]> some very specific subset of gcc maybe

[03:49:07] <snake> jkk, do you know what it means to be a "player"
[03:49:10] <sonny> your complaints are just bizzare, a c compiler and posix os will always require a lot of effort to develop

[05:10:12] <arahael> snake: A debate, at least in current times, is generally a "structured" turn-taking discussion, it's ideally suited for controversial topics. (Once the structure breaks doesn, it becomes an "argument", again in contemporary english).  A lecture, by contrast, tends to be one person expousing their view with no desire for turn taking.

[05:31:29] <dre> is lisp 
[05:31:34] <dre> always go back to lisp
[05:31:42] <apotheon> Oh, Common Lisp is probably another example.
[05:32:06] <snake> Guest8036, what happens after you restart the program? are the classes in their unmodified state or is it persistenet?
[05:32:10] <apotheon> I know less about CLOS, though.
[05:32:29] <oldlaptop> Guest8036: Really, what you need is the ability to redefine the entire object system at runtime.
[05:32:45] <apotheon> oldlaptop: thank you for that estimation, which I regard as complimentary
[05:32:49] <snake> Guest8036, also you can use JS it has DOM demonic object manifestation

[05:33:39] <snake> OR if you still want like hard types even after modifying a class... you could use an adapter pattern

[05:34:23] <dre> my birds are chirping for me to save them :( 
[05:34:24] <apotheon> The only reason you can't redefine the *entire* object system at runtime in Ruby is that it has one hardcoded object at the top of the hierarchy that breaks the whole language if you . . . wait, I guess you can redefine the *whole* thing, if you don't mind breaking the language.
[05:34:31] <dre> wife is out and I'm able to program in peace
[05:34:42] <dre> I don't want to get them out of the cage :( 
[05:34:46] <Guest8036> if you want to persist something, you can persist it
[05:34:51] <apotheon> . . . so yeah, you can do that in Ruby, too, and hilarity ensues.

[05:39:28] <oldlaptop> apotheon: snit (the Tcl object system I linked to above) has no concept of "inheritance" or anything like it; rather, object may choose to delegate methods to "components", and components can be any random thing (such as Tk widgets) that happen to act enough like a snit object for it to work
[05:40:36] <jkk> what is an advantage of delegation over inheritance?
[05:41:13] <oldlaptop> the example at the bottom of that page (before expanding the "Show discussion" thingummies) is essentially renaming some of a Tk widget's "methods" using delegation - note that Tk widgets are not snit objects, though the way they work is... "inspirational" to more or less all tcl object systems
[05:41:59] <oldlaptop> (though particularly so to snit, which as you can see considers tk important enough to have special machinery for it)
[05:42:46] <oldlaptop> a "component" could easily be something like a sqlite database connection, though, or something from a completely different object system, or even some core Tcl command like [chan] that accepts subcommands

[05:55:28] <apotheon> oldlaptop: How do you like using its delegation?
[05:55:41] <Guest8036> I think compilers should be put behind APIs
[05:55:43] <apotheon> I wonder about the practical effects on the programmer's work.
[05:56:38] <Guest8036> compiler service oriented architectures 
[05:57:34] <oldlaptop> Subjectively, I find it impedance-matches well with how my mind works. Mileage may obviously vary on that. It definitely comports well with how Tcl works in practice, which is the ultimate in duck typing in that there is no such thing as types
[05:58:14] <oldlaptop> if some string parses as an integer, it is an integer, and if some random command accepts subcommand syntax that looks like snit methods, it's an object for purposes of method invocation
[05:58:47] <oldlaptop> (and if it accepts syntax that looks like snit/tk -options it's an object for purposes of option delegation)
[05:59:53] <apotheon> I would think it's only "duck typing" if it can throw a type error upon mismatch, rather than doing something absurd.
[06:00:10] <apotheon> . . . but I guess my introduction to duck typing isn't academic in nature.
[06:00:17] <apotheon> . . . so maybe I'm missing something.
[06:00:39] <oldlaptop> expr {6.43 + shoe} is definitely an error, if that's what you mean
[06:00:45] <apotheon> I've known people, by the way, who insist that anything that isn't static isn't a type, though, so there's that.
[06:01:26] <oldlaptop> there is no equivalent to ("1" + 2) in js/python/etc, because there are only strings, some of which happen to parse as integers, or FP numbers, or boolean values, or whatever you want to parse them as
[06:01:47] <oldlaptop> and things that need to parse a value as something you might normally consider a "type" are generally not lenient
[06:03:05] <apotheon> something that appears to be a little-known fact about Ruby: Ruby gives type errors for something like ("1" + 2)

[06:05:31] <apotheon> In Ruby, + is a method (with special syntax to make it look like a distinct infix operator).  Thus, ("1" + 2) is equivalent to "1".+(2) and, thus, it is considered an error to concatenate the integer 2 with the string value "1".

[06:06:59] <apotheon> One can subclass String, too, and unless you really fuck with the subclass its instantiations will be welcomed in duck-type style for concatenation and so on.
[06:07:17] <Thedarkb1> I like Tcl, I wish I got to use it more at work.
[06:07:19] <apotheon> That's my impression of "proper" duck typing.
[06:07:40] <apotheon> It has types, and if the type you want quacks like a duck it's "the" right type.
[06:08:04] <apotheon> I'm still not 100% ready to reject a typeless system as duck-typed, though.
[06:08:08] <oldlaptop> Tcl is defintely not that, what I mean to say is that it takes the "hey, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck" to its logical conclusion: you look at your string, and see if it parses as a duck
[06:08:09] <apotheon> I need more thought in this area.
[06:08:44] <oldlaptop> (if it parses as a duck it's probably stored as a duck as a performance hack, at least after the first time you tried to parse it as a duck)
[06:09:10] <apotheon> . . . so its representation performs in-place implicit typecasts.
[06:09:17] <apotheon> That's kinda scary.
[06:09:32] <apotheon> I might feel differently if I actually learned Tcl.  I don't know.
[06:09:34] <oldlaptop> There's no such thing as "typecasts", there's no such thing as a value that's not a string.
[06:10:20] <apotheon> There is presumably a typecast in the implementation, even if the linguistic presentation of it is different.
[06:10:23] <Thedarkb1> That's one thing that annoys me about PowerShell, it's not really a shell, the data types aren't just strings and the "shell commands" aren't actually windows shell commands and don't support the same switches.
[06:10:27] <oldlaptop> (Some strings are just represented weirdly as a performance hack.)
[06:10:33] <Thedarkb1> They return objects or some such bollocks.
[06:10:55] <apotheon> oldlaptop: Depending on how well it paints over that, I guess it doesn't matter.
[06:11:02] <apotheon> (except for performance)
[06:11:24] <oldlaptop> Semantically, the "types" do not exist; they do exist as an unobservable (in the absense of bugs) performance hack
[06:11:28] <apotheon> . . . though I'm concerned about how this might work out if it uses IEEE 754 floats behind the scenes.

[06:50:12] <apotheon> I'm curious about how well an "obfuscated" Ruby program would go over if it was written such that it looked like a well-formatted, clear Ruby program, but actually did something wildly different from what it appeared to do, other than an initial chunk of heavily obscured code that set up redefinition of all the parts (classes, et cetera) used in the rest of the program.

[06:50:32] <apotheon> Would people find it interesting, or somehow not "obfuscated"?
[06:50:53] <oldlaptop> That separate language could fairly be described as "C with objects", I suppose, in the sense that it is (IIRC) a strict superset of C, just with extra stuff added for objects.
[06:51:26] <apotheon> If I was inclined to write something for GNUstep, it would almost certainly be a reimplementation.

[07:28:12] <white_man_from_t> ive got it extracted i just cant open it , visual studio code says not enough memory but ive got 8 gigs
[07:28:17] <white_man_from_t> -_-
[07:28:40] <white_man_from_t> yeah thats what im sayin!
[07:28:47] <PlanckWalk> What sort of file within it do you need to edit?

[09:23:15] <smallville7123> for example, a vertex chain would not typically need to deal with any color input/output since that should be delt with in the fragment chain
[09:23:20] <decker> that's why like there's an include for declaring a things global variables, and their init code in a vertex shader, and the same for input global state in the pixel shader and the processing algorithm for the pixel shader
[09:23:38] <smallville7123> (i think)
[09:23:59] <decker> somewhat - the vertex shader can setup gradient points on the corners
[09:24:08] <decker> if the data doesn't come from a texture map for example
[09:25:16] <smallville7123> can this be defferred to the fragment shader or must this occur in the vertex shader?
[09:25:45] <decker> sometimes yes sometimes yes 
[09:26:45] <decker> depends on the algorithm and source of data...  if it's a vertex attribute it sorta has to be done in the vertex but you could prerender vertex attributes to textures and deer to the fragment

[09:48:28] <ejjfunky> yea, looks like he's the bad guy, judging from the trailer
[09:49:28] <smallville7123> ok lets start from scratch
[09:49:49] <ejjfunky> but Johnny Depp looks too ... stiff as a bad guy. best bad guy i've seen is by Christopher Waltz. if he played this character, i bet it'll look better
[09:50:30] <ejjfunky> opps.. it's Christoph Waltz
[09:50:32] <smallville7123> a shader chain must have pre-defined input and output variables, right? such as vertex positions, vertex texture coordinates, and fragment colors
[09:50:36] <sonny> you have to watch to get a better view
[09:50:40] <smallville7123> at minimum

[10:00:42] <smallville7123> "16:27:00 decker: they dont ness need position and a lot of other things" it depends on the type of effect it does
[10:01:11] <decker> smallville7123 three's take on it is EffectComposer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27492603/three-js-transparency-and-effectcomposer  for example - you define a sequence fo passes - those passes have those parameters for those shaders used

[10:01:13] <smallville7123> for example it may be some kind of geometry manipulation effect such as a geometry deformation effect or similar

[10:02:16] <smallville7123> or it may be some complex mesh transformation (possibly limited to a single instance?)
[10:02:23] <decker> geometry shaders are a differnt thing - though you can sort of fakeit in a vertex shader
[10:02:29] <decker> fish-eye projection for example
[10:02:49] <decker> well becomes just part of the camera transform I'd imagine
[10:03:41] <decker> smallville7123 but the point of the composer is rather than trying to chain all effects - there's places where you render to a target, take that target, and render to a new target until the final target (combining some for like shadow maps etc) 
[10:03:57] <smallville7123> i meant like, for example, a effect that somehow deforms the entire mesh (probably cannot be done via shaders)
[10:04:10] <decker> not all shader effects chain; and it sounds a lot like you're tring to chain these render target things rather than like bump mapping and phong shading
[10:04:35] <smallville7123> yea
[10:04:45] <decker> smallville7123 the vertex shader just has to return a 2d output... it can do any transform on the vertex information it's given.
[10:04:58] <decker> though if it's extreme you might have to not do any view cone clipping
[10:05:06] <smallville7123> yea
[10:05:21] <smallville7123> it could do vertex transformation on it's input

[13:58:34] <gloomy> What's the "proper" way to average rankings? say I have four products that were ranked by two different people - ranking_1 = [3,2,4,1] meaning the first product was ranked third, second product was ranked second, third product was ranked fourth, etc., and ranking_2 = [1,2,4,3]. If I simply average them I get avg_ranking = [1.5,2,4,2], and thus an overall ranking of [1, [2-4], 3
[13:59:06] <gloomy> (note that I do mean ranking, not rating )
[14:00:07] <gloomy> but what trips me up is that when I implemented this the rankings start from 0, so they become = r_1 = [2,1,3,0] and [0,1,3,2], and the average becomes [1, 1, 3, 1] Which results into a different overall ranking (as products 1,2 and 4 now have the same average ranking). The fact the results are different doesn't make sense to me and indicates the approach might be wrong...?

[14:04:31] <PlanckWalk> Well, pretty much anything that doesn't violate the basic inequalities like  min_rank(x) <= average_rank(x) <= max_rank(x)
[14:05:33] <PlanckWalk> There are a bunch of properties that you might want an average ranking can have, but there's no average that satisfies all of them.
[14:06:40] <gloomy> phogg: The second one - products are ordered by preference (so ranking_1 = [3,2,4,1] means that the fourth product was better than the second product which was better than the first product which was better than the third product)

[15:04:02] <arahael> DnzAtWrk: You can check the type of DNS record contains using 'dig', however, the DNS bit is clearly working fine. The issue you have is your webserver (and wordpress)'s configuration.
[15:04:08] <nomagno> Thank ICANN for making this stuff unambiguous. And also actively centralizing the internet. Thanks ICANN, very cool!

[15:28:07] <DnzAtWrk> yeah, but would it hurt to always have it true
[15:28:10] <DnzAtWrk> would still work
[15:28:18] <DnzAtWrk> since there are two conditions
[15:28:38] <DnzAtWrk> if you got to the site, obviously you had the correct domain name
[15:28:43] <GeDaMo> Would it work if the host was other.com ?
[15:28:54] <GeDaMo> I wouldn't bet on that :P
[15:29:03] <DnzAtWrk> other.com wouldn't open the website and run the rule to begin with

[16:04:05] <vdamewood> nomagno: Component Object Model, is a standard Microsoft setup so that different C++ compilers and different languages could generate code that could interop.

[16:15:11] <vdamewood> I'll probably eat this up.
[16:15:32] <arahael> vdamewood: I very much doubt it - Delphi, Python, and many other languages use COM without using Microsoft's C++ thingies nor their .NET thingies.
[16:15:53] <arahael> vdamewood: Oh...  And one big, big trap...
[16:16:23] <arahael> vdamewood: Every single documented article about COM talks about reference counting, and it's super important to get it right...
[16:16:26] <vdamewood> arahael: Well, VB6 used COM without C++ thingies either.
[16:16:29] <arahael> vdamewood: But .NET does it completely differently.
[16:17:03] <arahael> vdamewood: .NET will use RCW reference counting instead, so the reference counting behaviour can be very much not quite what is expected by the legacy servers.
[16:17:07] <vdamewood> I'm just saying that I expect MS was focused on so-called 'OOP' languages and interoping their objects.
[16:17:31] <arahael> Ok, sure, but the _interface_ to COM is very much doable in plain C, and I'm sure that was by design.
[16:18:19] <vdamewood> arahael: Kind of. After all in many other ways C forms the common ground for language interop.

[17:43:33] <mishugana> As for usecases, I wanted to use it as a basic replacement for C for hobby programming - toy kernels etc. I had a look at Ada as well, but it is much much more complex, of course
[17:44:10] <vdamewood> Okay, Let's unpack some of the things here.
[17:44:12] <mishugana> So am sort of torn between the two. I find mem mgmt in Pascal much simpler than in Ada, for instance, but do you know how pascal would compare against ada for, say, systems programming stuff?
[17:44:50] <vdamewood> Standards: 7185, 10206. they exist, ISO still maintains them. Apparently people do try to conform to them, but they're not taken as the ultimate source like the C and C++ standards are.

[17:45:50] <mishugana> Right

[17:46:19] <mishugana> Hmmm

[19:40:29] <wedr> [itchyjunk], hmmm

[19:41:01] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well you can think of `a ? b : c` as being like `(a ? b) : c` where the ? operator returns some intermediate type that the : operator uses to decide what to apply

[20:02:05] <[itchyjunk]> heh, everyone seems to stumble when taking about CS formally :D
[20:02:05] <bjs> if it's not... what is the third operand? :P

[20:03:42] <bjs> KillerWasp: either you're arguing that there's only two operands and (_ ? _ : _) is a binary operator.  Or you're saying it is a ternary operator but the first thing isn't an operand and then I ask... so where is the third operand in this three operand operation?
[20:05:08] <KillerWasp> bjs: yes, i read the manual, and it's 3 operand.
[20:07:29] <KillerWasp> I was just saying that 2 serves to return a result while the first serves for the condition, only in the condition can it be assigned on a new variable or on the same one.
[20:08:00] <KillerWasp> I wasn't sure if the condition was also an operand.

[23:57:39] <apotheon> You just picked a favorite and are looking for excuses to reject everything else, obviously.  The information is there.  I've seen it.  I'm done having this farcical conversation.
[23:57:52] <jkk> facrical?
[23:57:59] <apotheon> no
[23:58:04] <apotheon> farcical
[23:58:39] <jkk> apotheon> jkk: How the hell is it a "big red flag" that it uses an onion routing network?  - you read message saying a decentralised onion routing network similar to Tor and your reply was as if it does use tor
[23:58:46] <jkk> talking farce
