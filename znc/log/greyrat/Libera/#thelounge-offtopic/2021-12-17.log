[11:42:40] <MaxLeiter> one nice part of this react project is im using typescript
[11:42:51] <MaxLeiter> so will be easy to bring the types to the server/vue 
[11:45:06] <MaxLeiter> the flip side is i like it a lot more than vue so maybe if it does have merit we do switch over ü§∑
[12:18:06] <fnutt> Question: What is the goal with your react "project"?
[12:18:46] <fnutt> If React is so much better, why did we go with Vue.js?

[13:29:57] <bookworm> it's about as much "better" than using a Nikon camera over a Canon one. Both can make great pictures, it's mostly a matter of which UX you prefer
[13:30:23] <bookworm> there's drawbacks and benefits for each of them
[14:03:36] <fnutt> So.... why spend hundreds of hours converting to React?
[14:03:50] <fnutt> We've already spent A LOT of time converting from js to Vue.js.
[14:04:30] <fnutt> I assume there's other stuff more important to tackle in TL? E.g. access to logs, skip to X message, better plugin support etc.

[19:31:42] <bookworm> I have to say I prefer vue, syntax wise over react
[19:31:57] <bookworm> it's cleaner without all the setter functions
[19:32:53] <bookworm>  and separate template and logic layers rather then the inline jsx mess react devs like to use
[19:36:09] <xnaas> but which is more used or well-known?
[19:36:24] <xnaas> More popular = higher chance of PR, yeah? üòâ
[19:47:59] <bookworm> not really no
[19:48:49] <bookworm> it's not like it's hard to learn the basics... most PRs don't need to touch vue in a way that's complicated
[19:49:13] <bookworm> and just because you use a framework doesn't mean that magically more PRs flow in

[21:06:48] <hbag> would be nice if the little taskbar icon for the chrome PWA had a little number in a circle next to it showing you how many mentions you got
[21:07:02] <hbag> weirdly enough the nativefier electron app i built before i started using this did that without me making it
[21:08:24] <bookworm> not sure if PWAs can actually do that
[21:09:16] <bookworm> oh, it can, well if the browser supports it
[21:11:34] <hbag> does chrome support it?
[21:12:36] <bookworm> yes
[21:15:19] <hbag> neato
[22:22:37] <MaxLeiter> bookworm: setter functions? have you tried hooks?
[22:25:16] <bookworm> that's what I'm talking about
[22:25:46] <bookworm> const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
[22:25:58] <MaxLeiter> how is it different from computed() / methods()?
[22:26:11] <bookworm> computed 7s something completely different
[22:26:56] <bookworm> the above in vue land is not setCount(5) but simply count = 5
[22:27:13] <bookworm> which is objectively easier to read
[22:27:23] <MaxLeiter> you have useMemo and the like
[22:29:04] <MaxLeiter> idk, you set have incrementCount() (or something) in methods versus setCount 
[22:31:09] <bookworm> you really don't have to no
[22:31:21] <bookworm> certainly not for a simple case such as this
[22:33:38] <bookworm> https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--eVGxVjpp--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://vue-screencasts-uploads.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/blog-images/use-state-form-code.png
[22:34:29] <bookworm> vue is way better structured here, especially the object spreading is really not something you should have to do manually
[22:35:44] <MaxLeiter> well you can get around spread with two hooks, for first and laste
[22:35:52] <MaxLeiter> point taken, but I still prefer react 
[22:36:08] <bookworm> why? (Generally curious, don't want to argue)
[22:36:34] <MaxLeiter> and @above I do think it would increase contributions, far more people know react 
[22:38:23] <MaxLeiter> I prefer functions > classes (vue 3 addresses this), in react I need to remember ~4 things (useEffect, useState, useMemo, useContext), and I have proper types 
[22:38:55] <MaxLeiter> store.getters.findChannel returning a network and channel has bitten me a few times
[22:40:51] <bookworm> that only means we are bad at naming things, or rather someone shoehorned the network into the thing that grabbed the channel
[22:41:05] <bookworm> that's not a problem of the framework but out app
[22:41:11] <bookworm> our*
[22:42:23] <bookworm> you can just as well make a react useState({network:null, channel:null}) and you are 7n the exact same boat
[22:42:37] <bookworm> that's a programming error
[22:42:38] <MaxLeiter> we lose types with $store

[22:43:14] <MaxLeiter> versus https://chat.maxleiter.com/uploads/de4b804522b47760/image.png 
[22:43:46] <bookworm> why don't you annotate the getter then?
[22:44:01] <bookworm> I'm very sure you can tell typescript what a store is
[22:44:20] <MaxLeiter> nicer to have the code be the source of truth
