[17:20:49] <MacGyver> It seems to self-correct after about 30 seconds but I wonder if this is youtube "optimizing" because you're supposed to be watching the ad first anyway.

But currently using chromium because I got some strange flicker in qb on wayland on openSUSE. (According to what I read a general qt/webengine problem since some user reproduced it in falkon)

[23:46:38] <anunna> randomly poping in here, but i only had the issue with throttling on youtube-dl, but yt-dlp i have no issue with throttling. videos start with a 1m cached immediately and no buffing, latest drivers for intel and my mpv uses vulkan drivers
[23:47:14] <anunna> on arch and gentoo, no issue
[23:47:16] <emanuele6> i don't have problems either.
