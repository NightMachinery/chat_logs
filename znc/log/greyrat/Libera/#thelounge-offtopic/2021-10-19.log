[01:51:19] <Activ8> where did dogfood come from when it comes to software?
[01:52:21] <xnaas> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food#Origin_of_the_term
[01:53:08] <Activ8> hehe - test your own product right got cha
[01:57:18] <johncs> an old coworker coined "catfood" to mean a QA/testing event
[01:57:51] <johncs> since we used to have dogwoods all the time, but we'd just be smashing at the feature looking for bugs, which isn't quite the same as just using it as a user yourself
[02:05:45] <Activ8> I like that terminology
