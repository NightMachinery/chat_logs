[02:27:51] *** Guest9 is now known as dbusse
[02:35:03] <dbusse> that confuses me a bit.. how  does it work that explicitly(greedy) .* doesn't select everything between, but specifying the implicit(lazy) .*? does? how can they be combined?
[02:47:11] <rewt> greedy means it matches as much as possible, so .* goes all the way to the end of the string, and backtracks 1 character at a time until the whole regex matches
[02:47:38] <rewt> in that example, the only thing after the .* is a single ', so it only has to backtrack to the last ' to make the whole regex match
[02:49:41] <rewt> .*? being lazy will consume 0 characters then try the rest of the regex, and if that doesn't match, consume 1 character then try the rest of the regex, and so on

[04:06:28] <rewt> does it say what it fails on?
[04:06:39] <re101-wolf-91> " Just a dot is not a valid floating number."
[04:06:55] <rewt> right, your regex matches just a dot
[04:07:24] <re101-wolf-91> It needs to match 3.0 or .3 or 3. 
[04:07:30] <re101-wolf-91> but not just .
[04:08:52] <rewt> right
[04:10:38] <rewt> so you need to make sure there's at least 1 digit in there somewhere somehow
[04:11:43] <re101-wolf-91> Yeah, but how can I express that? Could be no digits on either side, but have to have one digit on at least one side.
[04:12:54] <rewt> one way would be something like /(\d\.|\.\d)/
[04:13:19] <rewt> or a lookahead
[04:13:23] <rewt> there's a few ways of doing it
[04:15:30] <re101-wolf-91> How would I do a loohahead? I tried a lookahead along with a lookbehind, but I got myself tied in knots.

[15:39:45] *** Joins: Helmholtz2 (Helmholtz@user/helmholtz)
[15:39:57] <Helmholtz2> https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#RegularexpressionsPCRE
[15:40:10] <Helmholtz2> What flavour should I choose here? https://regex101.com/ 
[15:40:14] <Helmholtz2> I want to test jq regexp
[15:44:00] <digitok> seems to be a clue in the url :p
[15:47:55] *** Quits: re101-sloth-74 (~re101-slo@45.65.105.112) (Quit: Client closed)
[15:50:46] <Helmholtz2> digitok, there is PCRE and PCRE2
[15:50:52] <Helmholtz2> It uses this library https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma
[15:50:57] <Helmholtz2> Is it PCRE?
[15:53:25] <Helmholtz2> No where in the repo they mention what flavour it actually is (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
[15:54:28] <digitok> seems like a custom flavour
[15:54:30] <digitok> "Oniguruma is a modern and flexible regular expressions library. It encompasses features from different regular expression implementations that traditionally exist in different languages."
[15:54:49] <digitok> seems like it has most of pcre's features
[15:55:36] <digitok> but they've added features from other flavours too
[15:56:26] <Timvde> Lindrian: Yea, but I was like "that's probably at least NP-hard if you want to support all PCRE features"
[15:57:50] <digitok> looks like they've added some custom stuff too
[15:58:11] <digitok> i'd go with pcre/pcre2 on the site though
[15:58:18] <Timvde> Helmholtz2: PCRE and PCRE2 are mostly the same (especially when it comes to "basic" features), so either, probably. Use PCRE if you are in doubt, PCRE2 should be a superset.
[15:58:19] <digitok> there's not a lot of difference between them
[16:00:03] <digitok> depending on what features you end up using, i'd check the ref to ensure they mean the same thing in oniguruma
[16:00:45] <Helmholtz2> digitok, https://regex101.com/r/jXIfx5/1
[16:00:47] <digitok> for example, in pcre  \h  is a horizontal space, but in oniguruma it matches a hexadecimal char
[16:00:53] <Helmholtz2> Here is PCRE which has matched correctly
[16:02:21] <Lindrian> Timvde yeah probably impossible since you can't statically analyze the potential matches
[16:03:31] <digitok> Helmholtz2, weird regex, but sure
[16:03:46] <Helmholtz2> but when I insert it into jq it doesn't work: 
[16:03:50] <Helmholtz2> Should I ask it in jq?
[16:04:08] <Helmholtz2> ix.io/3sqz
[16:04:17] <Timvde> Yea, thinking about it, when I say NP-hard, that's polynomial in... which input exactly? :P I don't think regex length is a good indicator of its complexity.
[16:06:11] <Timvde> Helmholtz2: you may need some escapes in bash
[16:06:35] <Timvde> (or whatever environment that is)
[16:08:36] <digitok> gsub("https?://(?:www\.)?[-\w@:%.+~#=]{1,256}\.[a-z\d()]{1,6}\b([-\w()@:%+.~#?&/=]*)"; "my_cool_link"; "i")

[16:09:03] <digitok> if not, paste the error
[16:09:18] <Lindrian> Timvde Yeah its more about the tokens really. Subroutine calls kind of mess things up
[16:09:55] <Timvde> Indeed, that's the worst by far
[16:13:55] <Helmholtz2> digitok, http://ix.io/3sqI
[16:15:19] <digitok> test with single quotes
[16:15:39] <digitok> gsub('https?://(?:www\.)?[-\w@:%.+~#=]{1,256}\.[a-z\d()]{1,6}\b([-\w()@:%+.~#?&/=]*)'; "my_cool_link"; "i")
[16:16:09] <digitok> if that doesn't work

[16:17:06] <Helmholtz2> digitok, last one works
[16:17:09] <digitok> weird that it complained about all of them except \b
[16:17:14] <Helmholtz2> how :)
[16:17:33] <digitok> escaped the escapes
[16:18:21] <Helmholtz2> digitok, ah thanks...I tried this but missed a \b :(
[16:19:16] <digitok> \b wasn't shown in the errors for some reason though
[16:20:07] <Helmholtz2> ah you mentioned it also :(
