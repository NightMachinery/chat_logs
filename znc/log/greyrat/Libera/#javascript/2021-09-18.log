[02:13:12] <buu> seriously though, 99% of this is just like, super minor optimzation, the important part of code is always actually solving the problem
[02:13:43] <ThePendulum> often in JS someone might suggest to use functions instead of an object oriented approach, which isn't really full-on functional programming
[02:13:43] <buu> KDev: focusing on outcomes over process might help
[02:14:12] <ThePendulum> that would be instead of having user.sayHi(), you have sayHi(user)
[02:15:35] <KDev> So, I do actually suffer from anxiety so that's not surprising. I've been working on this project for about 2 weeks now, I keep changing the codebase after getting suggestions. I was thinking of doing an OOP approach but I always hear that "oop in JS is cringe"
[02:15:55] <KDev> Would you guys mind if I send a couple snippets of the code evolution? Maybe I've improved it since the first iteration?
[02:16:53] <ThePendulum> in practice you will usually use a bit of all of these paradigms depending on the problem at hand
[02:17:51] <ThePendulum> sure
[02:17:52] <KDev> https://github.com/AmishBaztard/Calculator/blob/main/script.js that was the first iteration
[02:18:17] <KDev> https://github.com/AmishBaztard/Calculator/blob/main/script2.js this was the second. Then I started getting advice to break functions down into smaller functions

[02:21:38] <ThePendulum> 2nd one is a bit confusing, you have buttonActions so you can do buttonActions[action](), but you still have a switch anyway :p normally you'd use a function map like that instead of a switch
[02:22:13] <KDev> Oh, i've heard of function map before. Everytime I try to google about it in relation to Javascript, I get things like array.map
[02:22:21] <KDev> and the Map data type
[02:22:29] <KDev> Does it go by another name at all?
[02:22:50] <ThePendulum> sorry I mean a lookup map of functions, rather than the array map function, different applications of 'associating x with y'
[02:23:04] *** Quits: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[02:23:14] <ThePendulum> example being your buttonActions and calcFunctions
[02:24:00] <ThePendulum> but there for example you would expand the amount of buttonActions functions you already have so you also have a dedicated function for evaluate(), so that instead of having this big block of code inside of your case switch stretching it out, all the case switch should do is call different functions, so you can easily see where it begins and ends
[02:24:28] <ThePendulum> same for your undefined and default case
[02:24:37] <KDev> Gotcha, that makes more sense
[02:24:42] <systemfault> Hard to do FP using IO functions...
[02:25:06] <KDev> Kind of like what I did in the codepen, how I outsource the functionality to a standalone function?
[02:26:22] <wroathe> systemfault: How so?
[02:26:36] <ThePendulum> yeah, when you have multiple lines of code that need to run conditionally, that's often a good place to break it up into another function so you can read the surrounding logic more easily. if () { doSomething(); } else { doSomethingElse(); } is much easier to read than if () { // 200 lines } else { 84 lines }
[02:26:55] <wroathe> systemfault: You mean just because emulating the IO monad is a bit wonky in TS/JS?
[02:27:03] <systemfault> wroathe: Well, IO is not pure unless you work in a language where IO is modelled as such... using some special IO monad or a Free monad
[02:27:29] <wroathe> Yeah, I saw that those FP TS libraries you recommended have an approximation of the IO monad in place
[02:27:33] <systemfault> wroathe: Well.. you could model it in JS using a thunk..
[02:27:38] <wroathe> Yup
[02:27:46] <wroathe> But it requires you to work with a bind function and thunks
[02:28:00] <wroathe> So it's not as nice as Haskell-land
[02:28:04] <KDev> So, do you think I should not worry about FP too much right now? It's fine to code imperatively in JS?
[02:28:15] <KDev> Maybe, just learn the basic concepts of it before I learn React.JS

[02:28:32] <wroathe> KDev: I would just emphasize learning how to program before diving headfirst into FP
[02:28:35] <ThePendulum> sure, often what is overzealously described as functional programming is usually meant as "split your code up into functions more"
[02:28:38] <systemfault> KDev: No, it means to do FP where you can: avoid mutations (use const, not let if possible), use the array iteration methods

[02:29:21] <KDev> and is OOP in JS considered "cringe" or did I just meet some weird people.
[02:29:34] <ThePendulum> and that, hardcore functional programming like in Haskell is more of an excercise than an advantageous skill in JS imo

[02:30:03] <KDev> So, I've used PHP Laravel framework and feel like I'm decent with OOP, but again like I said, OOP seems to get hate in JS unless you're doing a game or something.
[02:30:19] <ThePendulum> it's overused a lot by people coming from java and such
[02:30:29] *** Joins: Sven_vB (~sven@user/sven-vb/x-2094958)
[02:30:33] <ThePendulum> I almost never use OO if it's not forced upon me by some library
[02:31:09] <wroathe> KDev: I'm pretty far gone down the FP road. I personally have no desire to design or work on an OOP project again any time soon, but that being said I do think it's important for a developer to know the core ideas of both paradigms
[02:31:42] <ThePendulum> even for games I've often just used functions that accept state as an input, instead of bundling both, but that is one instance where I can see why it would be useful to do so
[02:31:58] <wroathe> ThePendulum: Agreed
[02:32:13] <ThePendulum> just never really reached a point where I felt OO would make my life much easier
[02:32:15] <KDev> Alright, so I think I'll just focus on writing cleaner imperative code and use some FP concepts when I can apply. Like you said, making reuseable functions, making functions pure when possible, avoiding mutations, using built in functions like array.map, array.filter

[02:33:08] <KDev> Although, I still don't understand how the non mutating is good for performance. Is it not faster to edit an already existing object, than to create a brand new one? Does the old one just get deleted then?
[02:33:18] <systemfault> It's often not good
[02:33:29] <systemfault> It's just that performance doesn't matter most of the time.
[02:33:30] <ThePendulum> it's more for predictability and reliability than performance
[02:33:39] <systemfault> And what ThePendulum just said.
[02:34:44] <systemfault> Also... JS compilers are extremely good these days
[02:34:51] *** Quits: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess) ()
[02:35:13] <wroathe> KDev: It really depends. There's a few different approaches to deal with it. One example is using "persistent" data structures to re-use some of the structure when you're mutating.
[02:35:25] <KDev> Alright, thank you for the advice guys. Maybe I can actually finish this project finally instead of over thinking every tiny thing. Just one more question I have in my head right now, it refers to the "map of functions" you mentioned. Is there keywords you can give me to google? Because even "map of function javascript" brings up a lot of array.map
[02:35:26] <ThePendulum> if you have an object with a number and you pass the same object into tickUp and tickDown, and tickUp mutates the number right in the middle of tickDown, you might end up with tickDown outputting the same number you put in
[02:35:39] <KDev> I want to understand use cases for map of functions, when I should use them and such.
[02:36:00] <wroathe> KDev: If TS/JS had the IO Monad, you could also consider mutating an object to be an "effect", and do it that way
[02:36:02] <systemfault> KDev: A "map" is just an idea of something that goes from a Key to a Value
[02:36:17] <systemfault> KDev: In JS, it's commonly implemented using either an object or a Map
[02:36:55] <wroathe> KDev: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure
[02:37:03] <systemfault> Some languages call them dictionary or "associative array"

[03:24:14] <Slade> so i'm peeking at a webapp.. the app makes http calls to itself to get some data..
[03:24:49] <KDev> another question. do you guys see any point in giving this to a function? I am always going to multiply my value by 10, and then add y to it. So x*10 + y. Is there a point in putting this in a function over using the math operations?
[03:28:28] <ljharb> KDev: only if you want to easily reuse the logic in multiple places
[03:28:56] <ljharb> KDev: like, if "x * 10 + y" has a semantic meaning like "convert units" or something, then you'd want a function to help document it and ensure that the math doesn't have to be repeated and thus maybe messed up
[03:29:20] <ljharb> KDev: but if the semantics are literally "multiply x by 10 and add y" and there's nothing inherently reusable there, then keep it inline
[03:29:35] <systemfault> KDev: I'm more worried about "magic numbers" like "10" than the formula not being in a function

[04:12:17] <AMPed> Hey all, I'm dynamically generating table rows that have a 'Delete' link in them, but so far I'm unable to e.preventDefault() on the click event for them.
[04:12:33] <AMPed> the line that creates them is: tr.innerHTML = `<td>${addr}</td><td class="m-2"><a href="" class="ml-2" id="rowcounter-${rowcounter++}">Delete</a></td>`;
[04:15:35] <pavonia> That doesn't show how the event handler is added or looks like
[04:17:20] <AMPed> pavonia: the next line is `$("[id^=rowcount]").on('click', function(e) {...}`
[04:17:28] <AMPed> but I think I might have just fixed it.
[04:17:44] <AMPed> by moving it into it's own separate function and calling that.

[06:54:45] <wroathe> KDev: FYI, if you're not already doing it consider using eslint to lint your code. You'll pick up good style advice from their recommended setting, and it'll help you ask questions about good JS style.
[06:55:08] <winning-luser> lantech19446: console.log ?
[06:55:35] <lantech19446> ok I was thinking there might be another way, I can do that
[06:57:02] <celphi> there's a way to disable it lantech19446
[06:57:09] <celphi> in developer tools
[06:57:28] <celphi> not really sure what you mean by if it's being applied
[06:58:04] <celphi> it's always applied unless you have 0 js or you turn it off in JS dev tools
[06:58:57] <winning-luser> my assumption was they meant the loading of js files
[06:59:03] *** Quits: onosendi (~onosendi@user/onosendi) (Quit: WeeChat 3.2)
[07:01:09] <lantech19446> celphi: it just doesn't look like all the scripts are being applied, for instance there's a script called egg.js that's called on in header.php the header isn't showing and neither is egg.js in the inspector
[07:01:44] <celphi> is it not showing it loading in network tab?
[07:01:57] <celphi> make sure you dont have js filter on
[07:02:19] <celphi> you could just right click page and select "view source"
[07:02:29] <celphi> then click the link to the js file
[07:02:33] <celphi> and you should see the JS
[07:02:36] <celphi> @lantech19446
[07:02:58] <celphi> if you dont- then most likely your path is wrong
[07:03:04] <lantech19446> celphi: nope it only shows 2 scripts loading in network tab and i can't view source because the header isn't showing up
[07:03:21] <celphi> "header isnt showing" ? meanining
[07:03:31] <celphi> <head></head> missing?
[07:04:29] <celphi> do you see the html to load your JS? ie., <script src="/pathtojs/myjsfile.js"></script>

[07:22:28] <wroathe> Intelo: It doesn't make sense to create a separate package or project for unit tests. They're normally tightly coupled to and an internal package detail of the system under test. How you organize them in the source tree is up to you.
[07:22:46] <wroathe> Intelo: Many are moving to a model where they keep their unit tests next to the source file being tested.
[07:22:57] <wroathe> i.e. src/foo.js and src/foo_test.js
[07:23:02] *** Quits: sickdyd (~sickd@120.51.82.69.ap.gmobb-fix.jp) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[07:23:16] <wroathe> rather than src/foo.js and test/unit/foo_test.js
[07:23:18] <Intelo> yes but another reason is that its not part of contract with client. so I don't want to give tests to him.
[07:23:34] <Intelo> so better keep in isolated project
[07:23:52] <wroathe> Intelo: Well, how are you distributing it to the client? If it's via an NPM package you can just add your unit tests to the .npmignore file.
[07:24:03] <Intelo> git repo
[07:24:11] <Intelo> will all commits.
[07:24:38] <sheetjs> if you are just delivering the repo at the end, you can sanitize it
[07:24:46] <Intelo> sanitize?
[07:25:07] <Intelo> the repo will be a mix of commits. some relating to src and some to tests dirs
[07:25:23] <Intelo> sheetjs what do you mean by sanitize here?
[07:25:33] <sheetjs> git filter-branch 'rm -f teststuff' -- --all
[07:25:36] <sheetjs> or something like that
[07:25:42] <wroathe> Intelo: Oh, yeah. in that situation you've got a few options. Other than the separate package option that you're discussing you could also use a git submodule.
[07:26:09] <wroathe> I'd probably reach for having a separate unit test package or a git submodule over rewriting the git repos history.
[07:26:11] * Intelo thinks.
[07:26:13] <sheetjs> does the history actually matter in context?
[07:26:22] <sheetjs> or can you just squash down to one commit and call it a day
[07:26:38] <wroathe> Or just create an NPM package and give it to them
[07:26:52] <wroathe> No need to squash it down if it's just one commit. There's functionally no difference then between it being a git repo and not a git repo
[07:27:17] <wroathe> Err no need to have a git repo if you're just squashing it down, I mean
[07:27:20] <sheetjs> "git repo" may be a colloquialism for "source code"
[07:27:27] <wroathe> Yup
[07:27:37] <Intelo> wroathe sheetjs so my options are a) filter-branch, b) git submodule c) npm package?    sheetjs the history matters for src dir. it should be continues history of commits everyday
[07:27:54] <Intelo> sheetjs so cannot use squash
[07:28:16] <sheetjs> c is not an option if the deliverable is a repo
[07:28:17] <Intelo> if its one project, it would have tests
[07:28:19] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[07:28:30] <wroathe> Intelo: Yes, I think those are pretty much your options.
[07:28:34] <Intelo> sheetjs ok. I don't know about filter-branch
[07:28:43] <KevinX> I would go with a submodule. You can pull it in from a workflow to automate tests in a GH action too.
[07:28:49] <sheetjs> there are a bunch of fun git tricks
[07:28:52] <Intelo> wroathe I don't know about submodule too. i have to search
[07:28:58] <wroathe> sheetjs: c) in this case is for the unit tests themselves
[07:29:01] <wroathe> sheetjs: Not hte deliverable
[07:29:04] <Intelo> KevinX ^
[07:29:13] *** Joins: Rockwood_ (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[07:29:32] <wroathe> Well, you can pull a unit test package in an automated tests workflow too
[07:29:38] <KevinX> Or option d) include the tests. Why are you not wanting the client to have them?
[07:29:41] <Intelo> KevinX wroathe oh do you mean the git url based submodule in package.json?
[07:29:53] <Intelo> if so, I know about
[07:29:54] <Intelo> it
[07:29:58] <wroathe> There's really no functional difference at the end of the day, other than letting NPM and your package.json maintain the unit tests version information
[07:29:58] <sheetjs> that's a common critique of sqlite
[07:30:15] <sheetjs> its some proprietary test suite that you have to pay for
[07:30:32] <Rockwood_> sheetjs, o/
[07:30:37] <wroathe> Intelo: Sure, or you could package and version your unit tests too. Either way.
[07:30:51] <sheetjs> https://www.sqlite.org/prosupport.html its under "Special Services"
[07:31:00] <Intelo> KevinX he didn't paid for that. Its for my ease. Not his :)
[07:31:10] <KDev> @wroathe do you still recommend a linter if I'm still sorta new to programming in javascript? Would you suggest I use one before I move to say react in a month or so
[07:31:17] <sheetjs> hey Rockwood_
[07:31:22] <Intelo> wroathe sheetjs i see
[07:31:41] <KevinX> sheetjs didn't know that. I suppose that keeps a competitive advantage
[07:31:59] <KevinX> Intelo renegotiate ;-)
[07:32:01] <wroathe> KDev: My personal recommendation would be that you learn how to program in JS from a book, and as you get further into the book start experimenting with a linter towards the end.
[07:32:22] <Intelo> wroathe sheetjs sounds like a viable thing but I just fear for a single mistake to happen: ie if I forgot to remove package.json line having test module dependency or committed it
[07:32:42] <sheetjs> then keep separate repos
[07:32:44] * Intelo wonders why can;t the test suite be independant?
[07:33:00] <Intelo> sheetjs ya so as per my original question. I will repeat
[07:33:16] <Intelo> I plan to have 2 separate project in addition to main project.  One for unit and integration / api tests. other for e2e tests. For unit test project I will import functions from sibling project like `../mainProject/src/file.ext`. The intention is to keep those separate for separate developers. Will I encounter any issues?
[07:33:31] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[07:33:39] <wroathe> Intelo: The problem is that you want some sort of version information in the main project for the unit tests.
[07:33:46] <Intelo> KevinX I think tests are insurance. Better keep myself :)
[07:34:03] <wroathe> Intelo: Because unit tests are versioned along with the code they're testing.
[07:34:05] *** Joins: carlino3 (~carlino3@user/carlino3)
[07:34:12] <KevinX> Judging by the code KDev shared above I think they would be okay using a linter now. It would help by giving feedback in real time (assuming you have a decent dev env set up)
[07:34:53] <Intelo> wroathe ya good point. the version of src repo and version of test repo might mismatch at times
[07:35:48] <Intelo> wroathe how about importing the src inside test module via git submodule? :)
[07:35:57] <Intelo> I can have branches to show as different versions
[07:36:01] <wroathe> Intelo: We covered that already
[07:36:02] <sheetjs> Intelo: if you're really worried, just keep two separate repos
[07:36:09] <Intelo> the name of branch will be the version number
[07:36:10] <wroathe> Intelo: You're talking yourself in circles. Just get on it.

[07:36:19] <Intelo> wroathe we thought vice versa
[07:36:26] <Intelo> sheetjs ok
[07:36:33] <KevinX> Intelo importing your source into the test repo would be an awkward workflow
[07:36:41] <KevinX> Do it the other way around
[07:36:42] <Intelo> wroathe ok. yes, we should conclude.
[07:37:05] <Intelo> KevinX its awkward from the start while not having test suite in main repo
[07:37:40] <KevinX> Just add tests/**/* to your .gitignore file and have at it
[07:37:49] <wroathe> Intelo: That last approach you suggested actually wouldn't be too bad. I'd probably go with that. Good thinking.
[07:38:16] <Intelo> KevinX ya but we discussed the notion of mistakenly committing traced of test code repo url in package.json or main project.  No problem. I would go ahead with either

[09:46:59] <systemfault> Using bitwise operators === Street cred
[09:47:12] <KevinX> exactly
[09:47:17] <systemfault> But yeah... the idea is to flip the fifth bit
[09:47:29] <Maxdamantus> ~(Using bitwise operators ^ Street cred)
[09:47:59] <systemfault> There are no reasons to use bitwise operators... unless you're actually dealing with binary (For example, to write an emulator)
[09:48:03] <carlino3> this is JS, not C
[09:48:07] <carlino3> why use bitwise operators?
[09:48:16] <systemfault> carlino3: There's no reason at all...
[09:48:19] <sheetjs> sometimes you need to deal with bits
[09:48:20] <carlino3> if it is for fun or a challenge i understand it, otherwise...
[09:48:30] <KevinX> I've only used them in real world stuff a few times
[09:49:02] <sheetjs> there are many cool JS libraries that need bit manipulations
[09:49:04] <KevinX> This is because someone made a joke about how long their toLowerCase() method was
[09:49:42] <carlino3> i'm not against bitwise manipulations in JS, but for this use case specifically
[09:49:50] <sheetjs> fflate is a pure-JS implementation of the DEFLATE compression among other things
[09:50:08] <carlino3> of course, that's justified

[10:26:11] <sheetjs> pick a problem no one wants to work on :)
[10:26:40] <KevinX> yeah... well. there are usually reasons no one wants to work on them :D
[10:28:03] <sheetjs> take spreadsheets.  there are a lot of challenging and interesting problems under the hood
[10:29:27] <sheetjs> here's a problem i'm currently looking at:
[10:29:30] <KevinX> Like getting it to render Doom
[10:29:40] <sheetjs> take a simple html table
[10:29:59] <sheetjs> where you have a TD with colspan 3 and rowspan 3
[10:30:14] *** Joins: sam_1 (~sam_1@87.51.251.118)
[10:30:22] <sheetjs> you want to "hide" the first column
[10:30:33] <sheetjs> if this were CSV, you could just skip the value
[10:30:49] <sheetjs> but you can't actually skip the TD for HTML because you still need something to fill the void
[10:31:40] *** Joins: kakashiA1 (~kakashi@ip-37-201-198-173.hsi13.unitymediagroup.de)
[10:31:57] <sheetjs> so you need to generate some fake thing that fits in the corner.  Do you assign content to that TD? if so, how do you handle the fact that you're squishing content
[10:33:19] <KevinX> I know this probably is oversimplifying :) padStart(table.length, '<td></td>')
[10:34:01] <sheetjs> https://jsfiddle.net/rk9bo8vn/
[10:34:09] <sheetjs> so suppose the "A" column were hidden
[10:34:12] *** Quits: comatory (~ondrejsyn@217.11.241.69) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[10:34:28] <sheetjs> the naive approach is just to skip the cells in the column
[10:34:50] <sheetjs> but if you skip the A1:C3 TD, then D1 D2 D3 get shifted over to column B
[10:35:57] <KevinX> Oh I see, with the colspan
[10:36:18] <KevinX> That's sort of an opinionated choice though
[10:36:38] <sheetjs> there are definitely undesirable answers
[10:36:42] <KevinX> but if you hide it, you could replace it with colspan.length
[10:36:47] <sheetjs> for example, lets say that A1:C3 cell had a background color
[10:36:59] <sheetjs> theoretically you'd want the thing in the space to also have the background color
[10:37:11] <KevinX> In react I think this would be trivial
[10:38:25] <KevinX> the colspan, visibility, and classes passed in as a prop, then return based on visibility with classes applied
[10:39:15] <sheetjs> is rowspan trivial in react?
[10:39:19] <KevinX> Of course with row+col spans you need something more
[10:39:27] <KevinX> yeah was looking more closely :D
[10:39:54] <sheetjs> im asking because if the organization is like how tables are structured now (table > tr > td) rowspans break the independence of the tr elements
[10:40:17] <sheetjs> it stops being "context-free"
[10:40:48] *** Joins: sickdyd (~sickd@120.51.82.69.ap.gmobb-fix.jp)
[10:42:11] <KevinX> Yeah you would need some well thought out algorithm. That is if you wanted to replace them with empty tags
[10:42:35] <KevinX> I don't know the accessibility implications either of changing table markup
[10:44:30] <sheetjs> Excel has some crazy behaviors with hidden cells
[10:44:39] <sheetjs> so in Excel, lets say you merge cells B2:D4
[10:45:04] <sheetjs> if you want to set a top border to the merge cell, you actually have to create fake cells for C2 and D2 and set the top border for those cells

[10:46:43] <KevinX> whenever I see copy/paste Word document "code" I cringe immediately. I can't imagine how Excel looks
[10:46:54] <sheetjs> excel is well-behaved compared to word
[10:47:21] <sheetjs> the copy-paste excel code looks like a mess because it has backdoor css styles
[10:47:42] <sheetjs> they are special styles with an mso- prefix that are interpreted in a special way by excel
[10:48:02] <KevinX> Yeah I guess they probably assume it's going to be pasted into another spreadsheet
[10:48:18] <sheetjs> excel actually populates a few different clipboards
[10:48:37] <sheetjs> the clipboard API exposes those by specifying a MIME type in getData/setData
[10:49:03] <sheetjs> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/getData
[10:49:34] <sheetjs> text/plain will have a TSV while text/rtf sometimes has an RTF table
[10:49:43] <sheetjs> and text/html will have some sort of html
[10:51:01] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[10:51:02] <KevinX> so the application can provide multiple clipboard content with different mime types?
[10:51:19] <KevinX> And the browser knows how to interpret it?
[10:52:07] <KevinX> or do you mean excel gives you the choice?
[10:52:11] <sheetjs> http://output.jsbin.com/uwuvan/5
[10:52:27] <sheetjs> if you have excel, copy some cells and paste into the text box
[10:52:58] <sheetjs> https://jsbin.com/uwuvan/5/edit?html,output
[10:54:26] <KevinX> so i could change 'text/html' and get something different?
[10:54:54] <sheetjs> so obviously setting innerHTML is a bad idea
[10:55:09] <sheetjs> hit the console tab so you can see the message
[10:55:12] <sheetjs> and add a line like
[10:55:13] <KevinX> I see it in the console
[10:55:16] <sheetjs>       console.error(event.clipboardData.getData('text/rtf'));
[10:55:52] <KevinX> But is the browser doing this, or did this come from Excel?
[10:56:36] <sheetjs> Excel set the various clipboards
[10:56:45] <KevinX> I'm on Mac, and I have Alfred, and in there I see the plain text variety
[10:56:47] <sheetjs> the browser API is used to grab from the particular clipboards
[10:56:58] <sheetjs> if you want to see what clipboards are avaialble on mac

[11:12:54] <sheetjs> SYLK uses some 7-bit escape codes
[11:12:57] <jaawerth> (and those standards are "whatever ncurses does", "whatever xterm does", or "whatever iterm2 does", usually some conbination of the above

[11:14:00] <jaawerth> or rather, it's still in pretty early-looking development
[11:14:20] <sheetjs> mozilla fought to axe websql because it seemed like the target was "whatever sqlite supports"

[11:15:12] <jaawerth> I like that it does
[11:15:35] <sheetjs> the development of a proper web sql standard would have been nice
[11:15:42] <jaawerth> and I agree websql should have just been a secured subset of sqlite's syntax, with extensions

[11:16:21] <KevinX> i agree too
[11:17:35] <sheetjs> the most cringeworthy part of this 8 year old code KevinX is the series of hacks and workarounds to make it work in old IE versions
[11:17:57] <jaawerth> if you preserved a js equivalent of the sqlite extensibility in terms of mapping things to functions/modules and such, you could do some wacky stuff like configure a syncing database or fuzzy-search indexing
[11:18:18] <jaawerth> I mean you can do all that client-side but it would have been a clean way to add a native interface for doing that kinda stuff

[11:26:44] <KevinX> ljharb I rarely test ios
[11:27:07] <KevinX> @ljharb Safari feels like the new IE though
[11:27:10] <jaawerth> but also opera got corporate-vultured and is now owned by holding/investment companies
[11:27:15] <ljharb> KevinX: it’s not.
[11:27:20] <jaawerth> so I basically treat it as dead
[11:27:23] <ljharb> KevinX: and not testing it is foolish
[11:27:46] <jaawerth> safari is a mixed bag
[11:28:15] <ljharb> in many ways it’s far ahead of chrome. In others, far behind.
[11:28:18] <jaawerth> but yeah, ios is too prevalent for it not to have a say in things
[11:28:31] <ljharb> “the new IE” is a cop out phrase, and applies far more to old Android than to anything else

[11:29:11] <jaawerth> well, it does have the most common with IE in that it gets boosted by OS defaults + questionable OS practics that limit other engines
[11:29:50] <KevinX> Yeah I meant development issues alone. There are other bad reasons to avoid it, and great reasons to use it
[11:30:26] <KevinX> I think it has a better UX and is subjectively prettier
[11:31:15] <KevinX> I wonder what comes after browsers though
[11:31:24] <sheetjs> saving files in ios and safari has been finicky

[11:32:10] <jaawerth> firefox keeps bith improving and hurting its UX changes. I love that you can now use %,^,* to search tabs/history/bookmarks in the address bar, I hate that they killed compact mode (unless it's already been set on the upgraded FF) and also killed the page action menu

[11:43:44] <ljharb> KevinX: that’s eternal. Shakespeare is packed full of pop culture references that none of us get.
