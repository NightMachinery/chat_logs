[03:15:09] <freeone3000> Hi, I'm trying to debug an openrc script. https://gist.github.com/freeone3000/2a4df3161bcee189e15d770c4343d607 has my script and its debug output -- but I see no pid, the process does not show up in ps, logs are empty, and so on. How can I make sure that $command gets started with $command_args ?

[03:26:30] <freeone3000> Yeah, that's the issue. /lib/run/openrc-base.sh should have start call runit's start, which should run command and command_args from the template. I've been following https://github.com/OpenRC/openrc/blob/master/service-script-guide.md and it just doesn't seem to be picked up.
[03:27:28] <Cold_Cat> I so want to buy a linux laptop someday. I mean, I can run linux on any computer, but the one I'm looking at is one that's using coreboot instead of the regular bios

What I'm thinking is like, define a button, it runs a shell script, the return value then colors the button, maybe a popup box with output text if any. In my case I would be flicking on/off vpn's.

[07:23:51] <ayecee> you could pretty easily drop in find instead of ls, if it's your fancy.
[07:23:55] <Sauvin> Exactly. The time for getting more dogmatic is when you're writing something intended for distribution.
[07:23:59] <Dan39> i usually just for loop a glob, it isn't much more typing
[07:24:09] <tirnanog> Dan39: the long answer is http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs, which is certainly worth a read, there was more to it, though. read without -r is wrong. not quoting the variable expansions is wrong (leading to splitting on whitespace and potential pathname expansion on the resulting words, should they contain globbing characters). not using -- is wrong (imagine a name that leads with a dash).
[07:24:12] <ayecee> though, find wouldn't sort the files by date

[07:24:58] <tirnanog> Dan39: yeah, there are still some problems, even beyond the ParsingLs business.
[07:25:24] <tirnanog> Dan39: the thing is, the names were already in a form that sort lexicographically in the way that was desired. so just a simple for f in appropriate-glob is fine and correct.
[07:25:45] <tirnanog> (the questioner was kind enough to make this clear; they usually don't)

[07:44:03] <tirnanog> ayecee: I see. well, it would be a bit laboured and would introduce the disadvantage of mishandling names containing $'\n' but, given that nl's output format is well defined by posix, it can otherwise be done: printf '%s\n' *.png | nl -s / | while IFS=/ read -r i f; do mv -- "$f" "${i##* }.png"; done

[07:49:26] <tirnanog> it can't internally keep count of things and perform the necessary substitution unassisted, which I now think is what you were driving at.
[07:49:32] <ayecee> that's pretty much what i said, but you're more blunt about it.

[07:51:31] <ayecee> teddykr: i'd be inclined to check the generated code. it may be that it's not actually allocated on the stack, or that it's optimized out.
[07:52:25] <ayecee> might compile with -O0 too

[07:54:14] <ayecee> wouldn't have to go all the way to the asm, i reckon. stepping through the array initialization loop would let you check the address it's writing to, and to see if that's more than the limit away from the base stack.

[09:54:35] <tirnanog> the cod-psychology chat.
[09:54:56] <labrador> Sauvin, so you can't ask questions about alpine here?
[09:55:16] <Sauvin> I don't know a damn thing about Alpine, but seem to recall it as being a GNU/Linux.
[09:55:29] <labrador> It uses busybox Sauvin
[09:55:41] <Sauvin> Ah, OK, yeah, we're not going to be nearly as useful with that.
[09:55:42] <Cold_Cat> So this chat is only for GNU/Linux?
[09:56:21] <Sauvin> Dunno about "only" - people answer what they can when they can if they feel like it. What gets annoying is when people *insist* on demanding answers to non-GNU questions.
[09:56:53] <tirnanog> no, but I think it's true that people will just automatically assume GNU and many Linux users don't know their proverbial from their proverbial when stepping outside of that particular comfort zone.

[09:57:11] <Sauvin> If somebody, for example, comes in asking Android-specific questions and we happen to have a couple of Android-savvy people to help out, I won't intervene.
[09:57:16] <tirnanog> Sauvin: speaking of which, the standard utilities are entirely on topic in #bash, as well as ##posix, if people ever get stuck (the former is busier).

[09:57:25] <tirnanog> and there are channes for both sed and awk.
[09:57:52] <Sauvin> tirnanog, I sometimes DO refer people to #bash when they ask Bash questions I can't manage.
[09:58:35] <tirnanog> it covers sh and standard utilities too, which might not be immediately obvious. where it gets dicey is where people think "I have some problem with a random utility that I happened to launch from bash, surely #bash will fix this!"
[09:58:35] <Sauvin> I didn't know about a sed channel, but I have also in the past refered people to the awk channel when they're asking questions we can't manage.
[09:59:12] <tirnanog> while expecting the channel to be 100% au fait with the program in question, by default. everyone who uses a terminal uses the same setof applications, rite?
[09:59:21] <labrador> Most of these dedicated places are very silent...like too silent. You'll get your answers in a couple of hours atleast
[09:59:23] <Sauvin> Sheah, once you start getting into exec or $(commands), the whole field is potentially far, far larger than Bash itself.
[09:59:29] <tirnanog> labrador: I can promise you that's not the case for #bash.
[09:59:46] <labrador> oh thats nice then
[09:59:48] <tirnanog> #sed and #awk aren't bad either, given their respective niches.
[09:59:51] <Sauvin> Yeah, #bash is a pretty lively bunch.
[09:59:52] <tirnanog> ##posix is slow, though.

[10:07:47] <mlu> but "bad" is relative -- it's still plenty useful

[10:21:25] <Cold_Cat> I would agree honestly, but that would just be in the case of linux
[10:21:40] <Cold_Cat> I have no idea on other systems
[10:22:21] <tirnanog> labrador: once could have a multi-user OS that coerces its users into reserving lengthy timeslices in order to carry out their work, blocking others in the meantime. a multi-tasking OS is conventionally taken to be one that switches between any number of tasks by rapidly allocations short timeslices in succession (the exact kind that we use noawadays).
[10:22:31] <tirnanog> allocating*
[10:23:16] <labrador> tirnanog, so a multi-tasking OS is by definition a multi-user OS?

[10:23:58] <labrador> yes
[10:24:17] <tirnanog> I think, at this point, the lines are somewhat blurred.
[10:24:39] <tirnanog> all mainstream, general-purpose operating systems are both multi-user and support full, preemptive multi-tasking.

[21:01:46] <freeone3000> honestly I'm trying to run a lot of my programs on a pi zero so it better fit in 2GB RAM or less, otherwise it's time to take an optimization hammer to it :)
[21:01:50] <ayecee> if there's no pressure, a lot of the app stays in memory just because there's no reason to move it out.

[21:02:07] <arch> So! Silly question, but how can one specify the tty a program runs in?
[21:02:07] <arch> I'm trying to tame a program that swallows signals like Ctrl + C by writing a script to run it in a new tty and to trap signals so I can make them act correctly, and have a new fake tty it can use ready to go, but I don't know how to specify the tty the program actually runs in

[23:00:04] <DPA> Are there any X11 applications which are just a standalone desktop window? Something like xfdesktop, but which just creates 1 window, and doesn't do anything fancy with it.
[23:00:04] <DPA> Reason is, usually, a program spawns a window for each desktop, and sets _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP, the WM then places them. But that doesn't fit how my WM is structured, I intend to make the WM manage what to put there on a per display basis, so I'd like to just start an app & xembed it instead.
