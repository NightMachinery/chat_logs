[00:48:38] <Yamakaja[m]> Yeah ... you're giving network admin privileges to all users with that
[00:49:47] <willcode4[m]> Maybe look at `capsh`
[00:50:32] <bpadalino> is there a way to use setcap with a group and a binary instead of just a binary in full ?
[00:51:08] <bpadalino> i guess maybe capsh would be better for that since it could be group associated ?
[00:51:34] <drmpeg> I think you're supposed to be able to set up a user owned TAP interface, but I've never figured that out either.
[01:00:54] <muaddib[m]> <drmpeg> "I think you're supposed to be..." <- It’s something more along those lines. I can’t remember exactly what though. Sorry if I gave fuzzy advice. Trying to shake things outta  my brain from 5+ years ago.
[01:03:31] <muaddib[m]> I’ve had the same permission issues with wireshark. When you install it it asks you if you want users to be able to capture on all interfaces, but that’s not the whole story if you actually want to do that. You still have to make a group and add your user to that group. Not saying that’s wrong because it’s a Wireshark permission vs system, it’s just kind of misleading.

[05:11:09] <patchvonbraun[m]> If you're usng UHD natively, you can set "named" gain elements that are peculiar to whatever hardware you have.  But gr-osmosdr doesn't expose any of that as far as I know.

[07:44:54] <linge93[m]> This is a solution, but the "message strobe" block sends messages cyclically. The function I want to achieve only needs to send a message. This message contains the "self.FilePath" information, which will be read by my subsequent modules This information and process it,

[19:45:06] <amlangford[m]> Hi all. Im looking for a way to log messages to file in my flowgraph. Specifically, Im using the in-tree mpsk snr estimator block. I need the estimated values logged to file for offline inspection. I found an identical post on this exact topic from back in 2016. The suggestion was to use the msg_file_sink.py code from gr-msgtools. I'm not having much success with this (primarily because Im a newbie with python) ... Can anyone help?
[19:46:28] <bpadalino> Guest91: what values are you trying ?
[19:47:49] <Guest91> I have tried with different numbers integer and float.
[19:48:45] <bpadalino> the default is 4.0 .. what numbers are you trying
[19:49:49] <DerekKozel[m]> amlangford: Hmm. I'd write a very short Python block to do that, but it would be a useful feature to add to the Message Debug block
[19:51:59] <Guest91> 4.0 unfortunately does not work , so I tryed some more real numbers like: 0.6,5,10.0,-4....
[19:52:17] <DerekKozel[m]> Would you be able to file a Feature Request issue asking for it?
[19:54:00] <DerekKozel[m]> If you compiled GNU Radio yourself already and are comfortable with C++ you could modify this line to print to a file.

Im try to figure out how to make use of the msg_file_sink.py code from here https://github.com/marcusmueller/gr-msgtools/blob/master/python/msg_file_sink.py#L41 but dont know where to begin. Should I add that class to the .py file for my flowgraph?

[19:58:09] <DerekKozel[m]> Actually, quickly looking at the msg_file_sink.py, you should be able to copy most of that into a Python Block in GRC
[20:01:43] <Guest91> DerekKozel[m] Someone already did here https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/pull/4894 , and it seems like it was backported to 3.8 but it doesn't work on my machine (3.8.2.0-14 on debian)
