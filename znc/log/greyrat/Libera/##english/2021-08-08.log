[00:04:14] <cthulchu> I think it's grammatically wrong
[00:04:20] <cthulchu> but how wrong is it?
[00:04:30] <LjL> i'd lean on "not very"
[00:04:49] * LuisM14 leans on not at all
[00:05:10] * LjL leans on LuisM14

[00:06:56] <cthulchu> probably pretty cringy
[00:07:00] <cthulchu> in an actual book
[00:08:16] <cthulchu> how about present perfect though? Like: "Huh, I've been under impression that Necromancy is fine."

[14:31:15] <user51> Hi. I'm looking for a word whose meaning is 'isolated facts vs a whole'. 'fragmentation' was my first idea, but I don't feel like it's the best fit.

[14:54:20] <StayHungry> 'atomistic' if you're looking for an adjective 
[14:58:45] <user51> Thanks. I also learned what 'adjective' means :D
[15:06:25] <StayHungry> user51: yeah, there are many frightening terms in grammar like auxiliary, conjunctive, gerund, transgressive, etc :)
[15:22:39] <user51> You could say what I asked about my own English. I can speak it, I can read it, I can understand it, but I don't have any detailed technical knowledge about it. :D
[15:26:59] <StayHungry> user51: do you speak any other languages?
[15:28:46] <user51> Native Hebrew speaker. English is my second language.
[15:30:01] <user51> I learned mostly through reading a lot.. but I'd wager video games had a lot of help initially, because you could probably pick up a lot of the patterns.
[15:34:25] <StayHungry> user51: English is probably also taught in schools, or it's by choice?
[15:36:00] <user51> Yes, I just didn't really listen in English lessons.
[15:39:54] <user51> FWIW, I still ocassionally have a faux pas because I didn't know about connotation.

[22:35:06] <Alex123> hello all, I am making a page, where I have two type of reminders. 1st - Schedule reminders. Every Tuesday 6pm, 2nd - Event reminder -  one X days before I have to pay my electricity bill. How would I title them that it will clear for others, are scheduled reminders, and event reminders clear?
[22:37:24] <twb> "recurring"
[22:37:43] <twb> and "one-off" or "one-time" maybe
[22:39:05] <Alex123> the 2nd reminders will happen every month too but before x days of billing date
[22:39:22] <Alex123> so if billing date changes the day of the month will change too
[22:39:35] <Alex123> only thing which is consent is x days before the billing date

[23:53:36] <dTal> this seems more like an interpretive question than an English question per se
[23:54:18] <dTal> it does sound pretty regretful
[23:59:25] <roo-> I see, because as I understand the background story of the song is about a passionate night that led to the singer's daughter
