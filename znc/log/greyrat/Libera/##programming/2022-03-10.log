[00:25:00] <ProfSimm> pony: I can explain it intuitively without formulas. Imagine we all have C amount of energy. It's fixed for all of us. We can use that energy to move in a direction, or to basically... move locally, think, move, act, experience time. So if you choose to spend all your C on movement in some direction, you effectively have zero budget for "existing" locally in time.
[00:25:00] <duuude> C > Electron
[00:25:10] <duuude> That is for sure
[00:25:26] <duuude> V is cool too

[00:26:18] <Decker> well frame is like the rigid borders of a cube that descbibes a discrete space
[00:26:19] <ProfSimm> pony: the C budget is very large, so the movement of Earth, Sun and so on, and our own movement is too small to affect time drastically for us. 
[00:26:38] <ProfSimm> pony: but it's tangible even at those speeds
[00:26:44] <Decker> it might also be looked at as a frame in a movie... that along time the same space changes

[00:28:13] <Decker> ProfSimm that's not exactly right though... there's a different explantation/undertadning.  That the space is curved near gravity, so electrons which move similar to photons have more space to have to go through, and hence tick slower...

[01:42:24] <dan01[m]> How does it know to display question marks?
[01:42:31] <vdamewood> It's kind of interesting though, that in many compression algorithms, there's some sort of trade-off, where it's possible to get a 'bigger' encoding of the data in parts here or there, but UTF-8 caps at 4 bytes per character, and UTF-32 is 4-butes per character period.
[01:42:33] <dan01[m]> Is that part of ASCII?
[01:42:34] *** Quits: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea) (Quit: Leaving)
[01:42:57] <vdamewood> dan01[m]: No. Ascii always has a high biy of 0.
[01:43:01] <pyzozord> no it's just defaulting to some symbol
[01:43:36] <vdamewood> dan01[m]: That is, ASCII is a 7-bit code. UTF-8 takes advantage of this by using the 8th bit to encode the higher codepoints.
[01:43:45] <dan01[m]> Hmm
[01:43:50] <pyzozord> because the number is sees is interpretted as some character which doesn't have a glyph in the currently used font

[01:44:32] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Well, character in the currently used encoding.
[01:44:36] <Decker> o the first if 0x80, then the type 0bXXXX XX__ bits determine length
[01:44:40] <pyzozord> vdamewood: yep
[01:44:56] <dan01[m]> pyzozord: So... somewhere it's like a big switch statement, mapping code points to glyps?
[01:45:08] <pyzozord> dan01[m]: it's called the font file
[01:45:18] <vdamewood> dan01[m]: Nope, it's even more complex than that.
[01:45:21] <dan01[m]> Aha, ok
[01:45:42] <ProfSimm> Decker: light is electromagnetic. electric and magnetic are also electromagnetic. The electromagnetic force and the weak force were unified in 1964.
[01:45:54] <vdamewood> dan01[m]: A single code point can map to multiple glyphs, a single glyph can be used by multiple code points, a string of codepoints can be rendered with a single glyph.
[01:46:01] <dan01[m]> rindolf: hi
[01:46:12] <ProfSimm> Decker: we have no reasons to think the strong is different. It's all the same force at different dimensions.
[01:46:16] <pyzozord> yeah unicode has lots of extra rules like if a specific combination of codepoints is seen together than use this glyph, or this formatting or this position
[01:46:22] <vdamewood> dan01[m]: When you make a font, you can actually write scripts to determine glyph selection.
[01:46:26] <pyzozord> it's like a layouting engine
[01:46:49] <dan01[m]> A single code point can be mapped to multiple glyphs 
[01:46:51] <dan01[m]> How does that work?

[01:47:06] <vdamewood> dan01[m]: Well, what do you mean by 'work'?
[01:47:15] <pyzozord> dan01[m]: some emojis are constructed from other emojis
[01:47:31] <dan01[m]> Well how do you know what to show when you see the code point?
[01:47:41] <Decker> there's this huge xml definition file that defines characteristics of glphs - some codepoints also specify- attaches the left and right of this to make something else
[01:47:47] <dan01[m]> Ah you mean like there are two ways to write diacritics in Unicode
[01:47:51] <vdamewood> dan01[m]: The font and the rendering engine have code to pick the right glyph.
[01:48:12] <Decker> and rendering order (topdown/leftirght/rightleft/...)
[01:48:28] <dan01[m]> Like I do by writing the accent ˘ an then the letter a
[01:48:30] <Decker> in aaddition to 'numeric' 'alphabetic'
[01:48:31] <dan01[m]> b
[01:48:33] <dan01[m]> ă
[01:48:38] <vdamewood> dan01[m]: The single codepoint/many glyphs situation is more like in situations like Arabic. The letter is different depending on if it's at the beginning, middle, or end of a word.
[01:48:41] <Decker> that's more of a single codepoint
[01:48:42] <pyzozord> dan01[m]: yes
[01:49:05] <dan01[m]> Oh I've heard Arabs had a philosophic debate about what is a letter
[01:49:09] <vdamewood> And Japanese has a character that changes how it's written depending on writing direction.
[01:49:19] <dan01[m]> aka if a letter in a different context is something else

[01:53:09] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Yes it does.
[01:53:28] <vdamewood> Unicode has been capped at 0x10FFFF because of UTF-16 surrogate pairs.
[01:53:29] <pyzozord> can it do 6 bytes?
[01:53:50] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Unicode goes up to 21 bits.
[01:54:17] <vdamewood> And even before the cap at 0x10FFFF, Unicode's theoretical cap was 32-bits.

But this interface only inspires total mistrust in any user for the simple fact that it's not pretty at all (like the interface of Quick Time or Winamp). The interface is totally practical and can work. Why wouldn't people be interested in this interface?

[07:24:46] <vdamewood> oldlaptop: Thanks.

[08:57:32] <audio> zvijezda, oh i know
[08:57:36] <zvijezda> by deference to top artists being crap is that most pop music sounds like an autotune remix which I find annoying
[08:57:40] <audio> zvijezda, i actually used to be a music snob
[08:57:53] <audio> zvijezda, but over the years i've come to appreciate even pop
[08:58:01] <audio> i shouldn't say "even", i love pop
[08:58:06] <audio> but a lot of people think pop sucks
[08:58:12] <zvijezda> interestingly I think your classifier might struggle with pop as a result
[08:58:38] <audio> well it's 10 songs from each of the 1000 top artists
[08:58:44] <audio> 10 songs is actually a lot of data
[08:58:50] <audio> too much probably
[08:59:06] <zvijezda> I'm curious as to how it handles heavily autotuned artists
[09:00:00] <audio> so the point of the classifier is to allow users to submit songs, and the model spits out "your model is 15% like Jimi Hendrix, 35% like Queen, 8% like Lady Gaga..." etc, but for 1000 artists
[09:00:01] <zvijezda> I almost suspect you might end being good at identifying producers than artists themselves

[10:03:32] <mehwork> cto's are usually out of touch because they're stuck in meetings all day, not coding, not keeping up and 10years later they're mandating stuff that's no longer true
[10:03:48] <mehwork> something that's totally true one year might be not true at all the next
[10:04:15] <sonny> netflix cto stopped doing in house java and switched to spring cause the devs kept pulling in deps

[10:31:25] <Deknos> what do financial investments have to do with that?
[10:31:35] <epony> that's how startups are forced to operate so they can not be "taken out" by sub-groups
[10:31:42] <epony> everything
[10:31:56] <epony> is money and time and performance and dependencies and risk
[10:32:13] <Deknos> well, but that could be said about anything. 
[10:32:24] <Deknos> that is not an argument for/against microservices
[10:32:42] <sonny> "one binary" should've been able to do it all from the start, that's the point of the distributed bit
[10:32:46] <Deknos> becaue microservices (as most things) make sense for certain types of systems, but not all of them
[10:32:56] <epony> you don't just design to introduce this overhead and model in your own choice on personal projects if you don't plan to sell it as a "leverage" against competing on the same plane
[10:33:06] <Deknos> shoulda could woulda.. it should, but most of the time it is not
[10:33:11] <epony> see the arguments are in the article linked
[10:33:24] <epony> these are extra comments WHAT really pushes you to do it
[10:33:29] <sonny> Deknos: thought we are computer scientists :P
[10:34:17] <sonny> I see epony's point
[10:34:29] <epony> the reality is, it takes on the operating system interfaces and paradigms as business to business services
[10:35:02] <epony> it's not "all shit", just not the usual way to design applications that don't need that model of computation
[10:35:46] <sonny> I remember something about rates and api calls too ... don't remember
[10:35:54] <epony> eventually it will take up the commercial application space on the hosted PaaS space, but not really how you design compact and personal computing applications
[10:35:57] <sonny> was this for microservices?
[10:36:34] <epony> yeah, they are typically api calls oriented or specialised message passing interfaces (custom designs)

[13:37:06] <lisp123> so are sets usually implemented through hash tables?
[13:37:21] <merijn> no
[13:37:25] *** Quits: mfiano (~mfiano@cpe-67-240-71-179.nycap.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[13:37:39] <Decker> a set can just be a list that adds to the end - like an expanding array
[13:37:42] <merijn> Some form of self-balancing binary search tree is common
[13:37:51] <Decker> or a linked list with no direct member access
[13:38:14] <lisp123> Decker: that sounds highly inefficient
[13:38:22] <DnzAtWrk> I should try implementing sweep n' prune using double-linked lists
[13:38:30] <DnzAtWrk> now that would be efficient culling
[13:38:30] <merijn> I think "set as hash table" is mostly a "dynamic programming language" thing, because those tend to make everything hash tables
[13:38:37] <lisp123> merijn: thanks
[13:38:45] <Decker> lisp123 maybe items come and go from the set often and there's only a handful to search through if finding is required

[13:43:42] <pyzozord> if I could flash it's software and install my own, that would work, no?
[13:43:49] <DnzAtWrk> yeah, just like that
[13:43:55] <lisp123> (although lisp is pretty good for binary trees too)
[13:43:56] <merijn> lisp123: Something you can do with balanced trees such as "what's the biggest item smaller than X" or "smallest item bigger than X" or "smallest item in the set"
[13:44:12] <merijn> lisp123: hash tables make these operations hard
[13:44:19] <DnzAtWrk> god, why is it always USB
[13:44:23] <DnzAtWrk> I don't want an auth with USB
[13:44:25] <pyzozord> hmm maybe i can just find a tiny device with lcd and 1 or three buttons and install some software on it?
[13:44:31] <DnzAtWrk> not only does it limit it to computers, not smartphones
[13:44:36] <DnzAtWrk> it is also vulnerable to infected computers
[13:44:38] <pyzozord> actually an old mp3 device would work, wouldn't it?
[13:44:54] <lisp123> merijn: I see
[13:45:02] <pyzozord> that's a cool idea, but I don't know how could I change software on an mp3 device
[13:45:34] <DnzAtWrk> basically, if you buy the cheapest android phone you can get, install google auth or any other authenticator on it, you have a dedicated authenticator with only a camera, a screen and keyboard

[15:42:34] <GeDaMo> amigojapan: the problem I was suggesting is that string literals are often in read only memory so if you don char *s = "string"; then try to write to that pointer, it will cause a segfault

[16:15:33] <ash_m> I mean, the redirect url will have been called already... If someone uses curl or something and doesn't actually process the back channel request through the redirect, the application has no way of knowing anyway

[16:17:07] <ash_m> Afaiac the only reason for it is to advertise "yes, this is the redirect url I expect to use" which is just slightly more data to prove the client is who they say they are........

[16:18:34] <ash_m> Yes, that's right.
[16:18:41] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors)
[16:20:43] <ash_m> I was thinking "wait what is the owner is the one originally using the redirect url param"? And be that as it may, unless the owner tampers with the oauth link set by the client, it's basically coming from the client as a referrer
[16:23:15] <ash_m> I guess it's just slightly more evidence one is who they say they are since its coming directly from the client supposedly

[19:47:18] <oldlaptop> I know offhand Google Docs allows for fairly formal revision control, though especially if you have non-technical people involved you'll need to train them on how to use it.

[19:51:57] <oldlaptop> Libreoffice supports "flat" versions of the various ODF types that work a /little/ better for that than committing the binary/zipped versions

[19:52:43] <pulse> diffs may be garbled due to binary but you can still move back and forward through versions, and maintain branches and all that
[19:52:43] <oldlaptop> at least they're unhelpful for "fodt" - maybe "fods" works out better.
[19:52:53] <oldlaptop> pulse: No, the "flat" versions are flat XML files.
[19:52:55] <oldlaptop> They're not binary.
[19:52:57] <pulse> ah.
[19:53:18] <oldlaptop> The diffs are nonsense (at least for "fodt" in practice) because the lines tend to be long.
[19:53:19] <Decker> with or without linefeeds?  git likes to diff on lines
[19:53:19] <sety> It works on string?
[19:53:22] <Decker> not one large line
[19:53:40] <Decker> ya
[19:53:57] <Wh0> https://studyinfotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/table_6.4.png something like this
[19:54:07] <oldlaptop> I haven't fooled with flat-ODS that I recall, maybe that diffs more sensibly, or could be made to do so if you were to pass the file through an XML pretty-printer.
[19:54:16] <oldlaptop> (The document's structure definitely lends itself to that better.)
[19:54:31] <pulse> you could use latex
[19:54:49] <pulse> probably not a popular choice
[19:55:36] <oldlaptop> Wh0: I'm confused. Do you mean the document is "like a spreadsheet", or that you want to see the revisions in something "like a spreadsheet"?
[19:55:55] <oldlaptop> If the latter, I'm back to my original question: what kind of document is this, and what kind of team is it?
[19:57:12] <Wh0> document is like spreadsheet, once a document is released/updated by person-A, it should have history like the image link i sent oldlaptop 
[19:57:39] <oldlaptop> What kind of team is it? That is, do you think training them on git is practical?
[19:57:57] <oldlaptop> You can get formal-ish history like that out of Google Docs, and you can /definitely/ get it out of git.
[19:57:58] <Wh0> i dont think so, unless git is gui based & user/visual-friendly
[19:58:29] <Wh0> i guess git dont work with spreadsheet, does it?
[19:58:31] <oldlaptop> There exist GUIs, but that doesn't sound promising.
[19:58:31] <Decker> while there are gui's I wouldn't clal them the latter

[22:12:23] <ProfSimm> Declarative is about WHAT you want done, now HOW. And imperative is HOW it's done. For example, "new User()" in Java is declarative, because that's what I want, a new user. While "INSERT INTO users VALUE ...." is imperative, because it describes HOW the user is created. Java is therefore declarative, and SQL imperative. 
[22:12:41] <ProfSimm> :P
[22:12:56] <ProfSimm> sonny: kinda

[22:14:38] <pyzozord> there are other paradigms, but I forget which
[22:14:59] <ProfSimm> sonny: if you mean async/await, in a way yes
[22:15:34] <sonny> that term is familar 
[22:16:21] <jeaye> `new User()` is still imperative, in that you're telling the computer to make a new user. A more declarative approach is to just use data to describe the existence of a user.
[22:16:26] <pyzozord> async/await are essnetially syntactic sugar for promises
[22:16:37] <pyzozord> and promises are a partof "futures" afaik
[22:17:00] <pyzozord> "futures" I think are "monadic"
[22:17:19] <pyzozord> so that's essentially functional
[22:18:34] <pyzozord> Declarative style you essentially declare what you result you expect and the language itself figures out how to do it. It's really like just elaborate config files
[22:18:46] <sonny> lets not use terms like monadic

[23:08:58] <ishan> Hello everyone! I am currently working with AWS Event bridge and Dynamodb. In dynamodb, Max record size is 400KB. In event bridge, Maximum put events object size is 256KB. Is it reasonable to expect that _any_ text or binary fields in the record can be compressed from 400KB to at most 256KB ? I did some random tests and it compresses quite well with zip/deflate but I am not sure if that'll always be the case 
[23:10:35] <flakland> ____A_N_Y___ text or binary ?
[23:12:21] <pyzozord> I'm guessing it kind of depends on the entropy in that text or binary but I don't know anything about compression
[23:12:57] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: Merging is simply creating a commit with more than one parent
[23:13:06] <pyzozord> also I think I heard that text compresses way better than binary
[23:13:09] <ishan> flakland: Dynamodb allows text or binary fields in the record so I have to think about it atleast a little bit. But right now, These tables only have data from some IOT devices and it's all just text. 
[23:13:28] <ishan> pyzozord: That is true 
[23:13:40] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: hmm I didn't consider that, I was thinking only of the rebase merges
[23:13:46] <ishan> in some random tests I just did, text easily compresses upto 70-75% 
[23:14:03] <oldlaptop> Rebasing and fast-forwarding aren't really merging :)
[23:14:22] <flakland> why 256KB limit?
[23:14:35] <ishan> flakland: AWS Event bridge has this limit. 
[23:14:51] <ishan> And AWS's solution to the problem is just to use more AWS services and make it more complicated

[23:19:05] <oldlaptop> The github network graph doesn't come out looking like the Wikipedia one, because it decides to put the right-hand side of Wikipedia's graph in between the two halves of the left-hand side. But it's there.

[23:21:18] <[itchyjunk]> oh that image looks like a tree
[23:21:20] <oldlaptop> Again, this is a very weird git repository. It's uncommon to have more than one orphan commit ("leaf node") at all.
[23:21:31] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: I see what you mena, you can literally reproduce the same structure as in merkle tree in git
[23:21:32] <[itchyjunk]> and in git, it still uses hash sum of its child for parent?
[23:21:37] <[itchyjunk]> if so, it's merkle tree
[23:21:46] <pyzozord> my interpretation is a bit different
[23:22:24] <pyzozord> [itchyjunk]: only question is, which way is parent
[23:22:31] <pyzozord> i think parent is the previous commit
[23:22:39] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[23:22:40] <pyzozord> oldlaptop suggests other way
[23:23:50] <oldlaptop> For example, this commit is identified by a hash beginning cf03, and that hash was obtained by hashing the commits identified by hashes beginning 83ff and fb70: https://github.com/oldlaptop/silly-tree/commit/cf03a08962b1555bfb783f85ddc6371b1c9cf7e2

[23:28:32] <oldlaptop> Both github and gitk are also putting each commit on its own level and sorting by date, instead of arranging them according to the graph structure, which is a perfectly reasonable thing for a real revision-control tool to do.

[23:30:11] <pyzozord> git cli also does it better https://imgur.com/a/8JDOHqq
[23:30:17] <oldlaptop> The advantage of the github graph would normally be that it can graph the repository *and* all its forks easily
[23:30:35] <oldlaptop> you could do that in gitk too, but you'd have to add each one as a remote and fetch it, etc.
[23:32:10] <oldlaptop> This all also means, incidentally, that git uses "blockchain".
