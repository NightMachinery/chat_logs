[07:56:46] <MetaNova> jcbjoe2021: the largest hurdle with [[Playback]] is client support
[07:56:46] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/Playback
[07:57:44] <jcbjoe2021> MetaNova: i unloaded it and going back to clientbuffer
[07:57:59] *** Joins: David- (~none@2.217.16.143)
[07:58:08] <MetaNova> jcbjoe2021: you do not have to choose either clientbuffer or playback
[07:58:36] <MetaNova> jcbjoe2021: they are not mutually exclusive. in fact, you shouldn't unload clientbuffer regardless
[07:58:50] <MetaNova> the *playback module is complementary
[07:59:13] <MetaNova> if you were "test" with clientbuffer unloaded, no wonder you were getting odd results
[07:59:46] <MetaNova> read what it actually does: [[Playback]]

[08:03:48] <MetaNova> tl;dr - if a buffer has messages 1,2[..]9,10, and persistent buffers are enabled, the attaching client will always see lines 1-10
[08:05:00] *** Quits: jmd (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon) (Client Quit)
[08:05:18] <MetaNova> whatever lines may consist 1-10 but ignoring that, say you saw lines 1-10 then disconnect. while you were away, three new lines were spoken, now you've only seen 4-10
[08:05:54] <MetaNova> if your client supports it/you have the script loaded/ZNC also plays nice, you can potentially only see lines 1-3 instead of 1-10
[08:06:05] <MetaNova> that's what *playback is for
[08:06:09] <MetaNova> as I understand it
[08:37:37] <jcbjoe2021> ok
[08:37:53] <jcbjoe2021> i would rather use *clientbuffer
[08:38:57] <jcbjoe2021> MetaNova: so i have clientbuffer loaded and all my clients are true under *clientbuffer listclients. lets say i leave and come back im suppose to get a playback right?

[20:36:06] <DarthGandalf> neither in git master nor in 1.8.2
[20:36:50] <DarthGandalf> upon clicking the Add button it shows the form with the details of new network
[20:37:13] <DarthGandalf> I even tried to changing username of my test user with mix of small and capital letters
[20:37:19] <DarthGandalf> what OS, btw?
[20:37:25] <beastDivision> arch linux 
[20:37:38] <beastDivision> installed from repo with pacman -S znc 
[20:38:59] <beastDivision> I guess I'll spin up a new image and try again. maybe a file got corrupted or something 
[20:39:11] <beastDivision> gotta be something local if you cant reproduce it

[20:42:50] <DarthGandalf> that message (No such user) is shown on addnetwork handler only if the user in the ?user= is not found in ZNC
[20:43:27] <beastDivision> not sure how that's possible since im logged in as the user, it's shown in the user table, and i see it in the users folder on the hard disk 
[20:45:20] <beastDivision> permissions and ownership all look right too
