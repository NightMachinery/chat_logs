[16:19:18] <gerikson> at least during that time, gold was money ;)
[16:20:09] <quanticle> I guess I'm just inured to the economic illiteracy at this point.
[16:20:20] <pja> But there wasn’t much money to be had in reality. Rent was often paid in terms of a portion of your crop, or by working on the Lord’s land for a portion of each week if you were a serf.
[16:21:56] <quanticle> Well, sure, *coinage* was scarce. But people kept tabs.
[16:22:15] <quanticle> You'd open a tab with the landlord for inputs
