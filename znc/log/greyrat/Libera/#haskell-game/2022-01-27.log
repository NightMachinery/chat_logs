[22:07:15] <test_> hello, is it even worth my time to develop a game in haskell?

[22:08:55] <f-a> test_: it definitely is
[22:09:06] <f-a> gamemaking is a dirty job as ever, so your will learn a lot in any case
[22:10:33] <test_> im looking to learn as much as possible, I'm at the University of Southampton UK and I'm struggling with it
[22:10:54] <test_> any books that target an audience that need a little extra help in the cerebral department?
[22:11:03] <test_> is haskell from first principles any good???
[22:11:04] <EvanR> you can start small and do text based games
[22:11:24] <EvanR> well, many text based games have blown up to be rather not small
[22:11:36] <test_> wouldn't that all be IO stuff?
[22:11:48] <EvanR> yes you need IO at some level to interact with the user
[22:12:22] <EvanR> ideally it's not the bulk of your program
[22:13:01] <test_> hmm 
[22:15:26] <f-a> yup
[22:15:45] <f-a> HFFF is good, CIS194 is good too
[22:18:10] <EvanR> as an example of a text based game, you have the classic infocom game Zork, which simply printed out something, waited for your command, interpreted your command which either did something or was nonsense (the ways to deal with this are numerous and amusing)
[22:18:37] <EvanR> the IO part of that program could, in modern terms, be like a single IO wrapper
[22:18:41] <EvanR> one liner

[22:23:12] *** Joins: coot (~coot@213.134.190.95)
[22:31:28] <EvanR> so the wrapper is not a one liner, but main = wrapper yourNonIOGame is
[22:31:30] <EvanR> https://paste.tomsmeding.com/tCwBp3j2
[22:31:54] <EvanR> yes it's a bit simplistic but it could have been how Zork was written
[22:32:18] <ManofLetters[m]> AAA
[22:32:20] <ManofLetters[m]> +1
[22:32:29] <ManofLetters[m]> and extra points for little IO
[22:32:35] <ManofLetters[m]> *style points
[22:33:26] <test_> that does seem like a good first project
[22:33:42] <test_> how do you think Zork managed to reply to such a wide range of inputs?
[22:33:52] <test_> just a big brute force search approach
[22:33:55] <test_> loads of if's
[22:33:56] <test_> ?
[22:35:38] <EvanR> they wrote a non trivial parser
[22:35:45] <test_> ohhhh
[22:35:46] <EvanR> probably in assembly language
[22:35:49] <test_> nice
[22:35:57] <test_> this could be done so easily with haskell
[22:35:58] <EvanR> fortunately we don't have to suffer like that
[22:36:05] <EvanR> yeah
[22:36:08] <test_> oh shit
[22:36:10] <test_> nice stuff
[22:36:36] <test_> hmmmmmmm
[22:36:49] <test_> im thinking perhaps a calculator in haskell now
[22:37:00] <f-a> that would be fine too
[22:37:02] <test_> using haskell's weird functional type stuff
[22:37:05] <test_> and then zork
[22:37:10] <test_> thanks 
[22:38:03] <ManofLetters[m]> have fun!
