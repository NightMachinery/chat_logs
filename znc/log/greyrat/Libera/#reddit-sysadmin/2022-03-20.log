[08:06:02] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:06:10] <Kiernian|Work> yup
[08:06:39] <Hunterkll> i remember payin' $4.50/gal or so around 2008 ish timeframe, and laughed all the way between my semiroutine trip between the baltimore and NYC regions
[08:06:47] <Hunterkll> because i was pushing past 50mpg and didn't care
[08:06:48] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:08:26] <Hunterkll> ... also i only had a like 4.5 gallon tank
[08:08:50] <Kiernian|Work> prius?
[08:09:11] <Hunterkll> pffff
[08:09:15] <Hunterkll> like i could have afforded car insurance
[08:09:18] <Hunterkll> Honda, VTX 1300
[08:09:23] <Kiernian|Work> Ha! Nice :)
[08:09:28] <Hunterkll> 18/19 year old me only paying $250/year for full coverage
[08:09:28] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:10:24] <Kiernian|Work> I remember the first time I got tagged to go from in-house to a deployment with a field tech. He had a prius. Us two 6'2" 250lb+ guys and 300 pounds of rack mounted servers in the back made getting on the highway REALLY funny.
[08:10:53] <Kiernian|Work> I was like "dude, pedal on the right" he was all "it's floored"
[08:11:27] <Hunterkll> shoulda overclocked it
[08:11:30] <Hunterkll> :D
[08:11:31] <Kiernian|Work> LOL
[08:12:03] <misspwn> poor car
[08:12:07] <Kiernian|Work> I know, right?
[08:12:27] <Hunterkll> at least it wasn't like an early ... honda i think?
[08:12:29] <misspwn> prius tryin to be the little engine that could over here
[08:12:43] <Hunterkll> they got into the japanese car market by strapping motorcycle engines in frames so they could sneak past regulations keeping them from making cars
[08:12:43] <Hunterkll> lol
[08:12:49] <Kiernian|Work> The words "I think I can" *were* actually uttered during that trip
[08:13:02] <misspwn> hah
[08:13:38] <Kiernian|Work> He politely requested that next time THAT much gear needed to go across town that they courier it.
[08:14:19] <Kiernian|Work> or use one of the fleet trucks or something
[08:14:21] <misspwn> forget the servers, i was just trying to picture tall dudes in a prius
[08:14:35] <misspwn> maybe they are roomier over top than i imagine
[08:15:13] <misspwn> i'm a foot shorter than that so i have all the room in the world lmao
[08:15:20] <Kiernian|Work> oh yeah, that part was uncomfortable as well. And no, they're not. Thankfully, most of my height is in my torso, so leg room isn't AS big of a concern as it is with some folks, but still. 6'2" tall and a 32 inch inseam
[08:15:55] <Kiernian|Work> still not as bad as some of the rental cars I've had over the years
[08:17:27] <Kiernian|Work> circa 2007 VW bug was one of the worst. That and a chevy...crap... not an aveo...a really small non-EV chevy from the same time period though
[08:24:41] <Hunterkll> hm
[08:24:51] <Hunterkll> 25% acidity vinegar is actually reallly tasty dipping sauce for bbq pulled pork

[08:38:06] <Kiernian|Work> I think that's the way they do it in south carolina, or one of the two (if not both) of the carolinas. BBQ sauce is typically thinner and contains much more vinegar
[08:39:02] <Kiernian|Work> I'm a vinegar nut in general anyway. Given my druthers I'll put half a pint of malt vinegar over a pile of fish and chips
[08:40:38] <yuken> I love sour - vinegar, lemon, whatever

[08:47:34] <Hunterkll> frequently bought together: 950ml concetraced acetic acid 99%, 2 lbs of potassium hydroxide flakes, and 25 grams of trypsin 1:100 powder
[08:47:43] <yuken> is
[08:47:46] <yuken> is that fucking TATP?
[08:48:02] <yuken> Triacetone Triperoxide...
[08:48:09] <yuken> acetic acide, potassium hydroxide, hol up

[08:49:06] <Hunterkll> EMS 2200 Trypsin 1:100 powder 25g's page says it's frequently bought with potassium hydroxide flakes 2lbs, and thymol crystals
[08:49:08] <Hunterkll> wtf are people making
[08:49:50] <yuken> so they're buying lye, to increase the pH of something.
[08:49:55] <Hunterkll> i mean
[08:49:59] <Hunterkll> i know what trypsin is used for
[08:50:07] <yuken> Trypsin is an enzyme, for some sort of catalytic reaction...
[08:50:16] <yuken> wait a minute
[08:50:19] <yuken> Hunterkll, yeah, that's probably meth.
[08:50:22] <Hunterkll> lol no
[08:50:26] <yuken> well not meth, but drugs.
[08:50:30] <Hunterkll> trypsin is often used in cell sample/culture preparation 
[08:50:35] <Hunterkll> so would pure acetic acid
[08:50:40] <Hunterkll> the hydroxide i'm not sure about
[08:51:23] <Hunterkll> ah, also used in cell cultures

[08:52:04] <yuken> If I was buying those ingredients Hunterkll, it would be used for drugs.
[08:52:09] <yuken> hence the hypothesis :(
[08:54:17] <Hunterkll> yuken: also, everclear is like $16.99 per 750ml here
[08:54:20] <Hunterkll> slightly cheaper in 1.5L

[09:19:26] <CableNinja> from what I heard they held off proposing/starting the new stargate series because of the talks with amazon, but now that they've bought them theres likely to be a new one or a continuation of stargate universe (that'd be nice). unfortunately I'm pretty disappointed that amazon has gotten MGM, because that likely means you wont be able to watch the new stargate series once it airs, unless you've got amazon

[11:40:58] <ptaav> netflix just added that ukranian comedy that their president used to star in
[11:41:01] <Activ8> prices of netflix has gone up again in UK and now they talking about charging extra for another person to be connected to the account

[11:42:53] <ptaav> i think they'll be more expensive than hbo once everything's done

[11:43:34] <Activ8> I'm fairly confident this streaming stuff now is just a fad and once prices rise members will decline massively 
[11:43:38] <ptaav> so there's some diamonds there.
[11:43:45] <ptaav> hulu's also went to shit.
[11:43:52] <CableNinja> yeah hulus been terrible for a while
[11:43:55] <ptaav> i'd have cancelled it without fx on hulu
[11:44:02] <CableNinja> thats why I started seeking out the '123' sites
[11:44:23] <CableNinja> I think watched like 2000 movies last year
[11:44:52] <ptaav> i've shifted to mostly documentary and nonfiction limited series
[11:45:05] <ptaav> with the exception of stuff like snowfall and the like
[11:45:18] <ptaav> the rest of it's garbage - nutrek and the disney+ shows
[11:45:20] <ptaav> blech
[11:45:28] <Activ8> and don't forget with all the other price rises people need to choose what they do, food, (fuel/gas/elec), films and more
[11:45:29] <CableNinja> theres not a lot of good stuff like that on netflix or hulu, I go to youtube for that stuff
[11:45:32] <Activ8> priorities 
[11:45:47] <Activ8> it's cheaper for a netflix premium plan to watch the movies on there now
[11:45:52] <CableNinja> I grabbed hbo+ for about 2 weeks before I gave up
[11:46:02] <ptaav> well i've noticed that the streaming is all i have in terms of creature comforts
[11:46:19] <CableNinja> thought it would be worthwhile, was total shit, one single show I'd maybe watch on there was left
[11:46:27] <ptaav> hbomax has some good hidden shows
[11:46:42] <ptaav> i never heard of stath
[11:46:51] <CableNinja> also thought discovery+ would be great, nope, all fucking new 'documentaries' about rednecks
[11:46:52] <Activ8> I may remove all paid for stuff online and just go to free movie sites on my amazon stick
[11:47:06] <Activ8> not illegal movie sites legal ones that allow you to stream for adverts
[11:47:12] <ptaav> +lets flats until i happened upon it on hbo
[11:47:33] <ptaav> the free stuff on amazon's actually pretty good. pluto and tubi
[11:47:41] <ptaav> even imdb if you don't mind ads
[11:47:49] <CableNinja> ^ was just gonna mention imdb tv
[11:47:51] <CableNinja> not terrible
[11:48:00] <Activ8> yeh that's a free one
[11:48:03] <ptaav> i watch judge judy on it every day
[11:48:03] <Activ8> I use that
[11:48:05] <CableNinja> hard to find stuff to watch, but theres decent stuff on there sometimes
[11:48:12] <ptaav> worth the price of admission
[11:48:29] <Activ8> I'm going to do that I think, cancel all subscription models and move to freemium
[11:49:36] <Activ8> what's everyone up to today? i might be fishing this afternoon going to the lake to see what the conditions are like first 
[11:49:45] <Activ8> then having lunch then going out 
[11:49:46] <CableNinja> I really should purge my closet
[11:49:52] <ptaav> i'm at work until 5am
[11:49:52] <CableNinja> but idk if I'm actually going to
[11:49:59] <Activ8> work on a sunday? 
[11:50:03] <ptaav> then i sleep until 5pm. work another 12 hours
[11:50:07] <ptaav> then off until friday
[11:50:09] <CableNinja> I gotta figure out what to do with 200lbs of old mail
[11:50:11] <ptaav> yeah i work weekends
[11:50:17] <ptaav> most badass schedule evar.
[11:50:20] <Activ8> ouch
[11:50:26] <ptaav> 3x12
[11:50:29] <ptaav> nights
[11:50:31] <Activ8> ahh
[11:50:39] <Activ8> so you get time off during week though?
[11:50:43] <ptaav> no calls except from perverts who call and want help masturbating
[11:50:43] <CableNinja> ptaav, I used to have that schedule, 3x12 one week, then 4x12 next week
[11:50:43] <ptaav> yeah
[11:50:44] <Activ8> like 3 on 4 off or something 
[11:50:47] <ptaav> 4 days
[11:50:51] <CableNinja> my days off were mid week
[11:50:59] <ptaav> this is the best job i've had in some time
[11:51:01] <ptaav> work from home.
[11:51:04] <Activ8> nice
[11:51:07] <ptaav> nothing but patching machines
[11:51:10] <Activ8> I work from home as well mon-wed
[11:51:18] <CableNinja> I'm full wfh
[11:51:25] <ptaav> and playing NOC
[11:51:32] <ptaav> which means sitting here binging tv
[11:51:59] <ptaav> maybe smoking da kush when required
[11:52:11] <CableNinja> ^ thats basically me all day
[11:52:15] <Activ8> I get out a lot more now fishing so not on here as much as I used to but still connected 24/7
[11:52:17] <CableNinja> smoke, watch tv while workin
[11:52:24] <CableNinja> tv is mostly for background noise though
[11:52:29] <ptaav> i need to use my days off more effectively
[11:52:43] <ptaav> CableNinja, yeah unless its some cool true crime show
[11:52:47] <CableNinja> ptaav, when I was doing 3 and 4 day weeks, my body never knew what to do on the extra day off
[11:53:11] <ptaav> i watched this limited series on john gacy and a nationwide pedo ring that operated in the 70s
[11:53:14] <CableNinja> on the 3 day work week, I'd have 4 days off, and that 4th day my body never knew if it needed to sleep or should stay awake
[11:53:22] <CableNinja> bleh I dont watch those shits
[11:53:29] <ptaav> Casteil, the hardest part is switching from night to day
[11:53:38] <CableNinja> tabfaaaaail
[11:53:41] <Activ8> remember people we are not here to work, we are here to enjoy ourselves.  Work is just a side thing to do those enjoyment activities.
[11:53:50] <CableNinja> indeed
[11:53:55] <CableNinja> I went for a drive today
[11:54:06] <CableNinja> and finally satisfied my mighty need of a monte cristo
[11:54:10] <ptaav> work is just something keeping me from having to raise crops
[11:54:17] <ptaav> man, i want a monte cristo
[11:54:22] <ptaav> hard to find around here though
[11:54:25] <CableNinja> same
[11:54:33] <CableNinja> its so hard to find one, I had to drive 20+ miles for one
[11:55:00] <CableNinja> and it wasnt as good as everyone said it was. it satisfied my craving, but they went way too much on the turkey and lacked the extra swiss
[11:55:02] <ptaav> i'd have to drive even longer. the midwest is a food desert
[11:55:07] <CableNinja> nahway

[12:02:57] <CableNinja> uh.. no.
[12:03:15] <CableNinja> so instead of the regular crackheads you'd rather deal with the wild methheads out in the 'boonies' of LA
[12:03:35] <CableNinja> literally theres no problem in the south of CA that you could go and NOT see the shitshow
[12:03:36] <ptaav> i don't mind problems like that
[12:03:45] <CableNinja> yeah you say that
[12:03:45] <ptaav> i kind of enjoy them, to be honest.
[12:04:00] <ptaav> i'd have loved to live in 1980s NYC
[12:04:16] <CableNinja> its all fun and games until you start hearing gun shots less than 50ft away
[12:04:38] <ptaav> maybe
[12:04:48] <ptaav> in any case i'm planning to visit LA soon
[12:04:52] <ptaav> just for a nice vacation

[12:06:06] <CableNinja> I'm serious man, you do not want to live here... about the only good thing I can say about LA is that it made me figure out who I really am

[12:07:34] <ptaav> the assholes and crime - that's a constant all through the US
[12:08:30] <ptaav> i lived in san diego around 20 years ago so my opinion's probably colored by nostalgia. but the rest of the country sucks too.
[12:09:02] <euphoricallysane> There is an asshole quotient, somewhat correlated with population density variance
[12:09:03] <CableNinja> yeah ok, dont mind the trash piles sitting untouched other than being added on to that smell like human shit at 20ft. I'm not saying the homeless are bad people, at all. but there are -SO- many here... what used to be a nice drive along a nature reserve is now cram packed full of crackhead RVs
[12:09:24] <ptaav> from what i understand the homeless out there have zero manners
[12:09:30] <CableNinja> heh..
[12:09:32] <ptaav> shitting on the sidewalk and etc
[12:09:54] <CableNinja> a few months ago I found $10 in the alley, I'm doing well so I decided to give it to a homeless person
[12:10:00] <CableNinja> you know what they said instead of thanks?
[12:10:03] <CableNinja> 'can I have your dog'
[12:10:13] <ptaav> were they mentally ill?
[12:10:17] <CableNinja> idk
[12:10:18] <euphoricallysane> when you are trying to survive, the depth by which despondence forces a person to places, you wonder why they maliciously shit of the street?
[12:11:07] <CableNinja> theres 2, 3ish categories of homeless people
[12:11:15] <euphoricallysane> in the 80s there were state run in/outpatient programs
[12:11:24] <euphoricallysane> now it is all privatized
[12:12:02] <euphoricallysane> the (false) rule of thirds, 1/3 of people are irresponsive to treatment

[17:57:40] <monr0e> Telgareith: If you have two-phase in, you'll likely need a second feed line. I wouldn't risk 400a on one feed at 110v. If you have three-phase in, and everything in the project can run from 110v, you might be able to get away with balanced phase - which is one common, and one each for each 200a consumer unit. This is how some terraced flats are designed in the UK - but its not common, and for good reason. Realistically, if you want to 
[17:57:40] <monr0e> do this properly, you need a second feed line from the grid.

[18:01:43] <monr0e> As for the consumer unit, you *can* find 200a breakers over here, but they operate at 240v. You could conceivably import a consumer unit from the UK or EU, but that might not be permitted legally. Unfortunately, the practise of double-breaker installation doesn't work in the US because of how you structure your phasing (I think?).

[18:06:03] <monr0e> Once upon a time, I held 80,000 btc. I was maybe 16 or so, and didn't back it up when I installed Windows 7 on my Vista laptop. When I was 21, BTC hit (alt#156)20k. I was not amused.

[18:08:31] <MJCD> haven't even the faintest idea which -- probably eth ;//

[18:09:50] <MJCD> and would like ideally a smol % of each sale iteratively also which cannot be done with traditional models
[18:10:02] <MJCD> and yeahhh it's... Kind of NFT's... Mixed media.
[18:10:09] <monr0e> Iteratively? what do you mean by that? 
[18:10:09] <MJCD> which I hate tbh lol
[18:10:18] <bomb> mixed martial arts
[18:10:26] <MJCD> so each time it's sold we'll get like, 2% or something
[18:10:37] <bomb> so you accept payments with cryptocurrencies? but converting those to USD costs a lot of money
[18:10:41] <MJCD> which you can do with most of the chains afaik
[18:10:41] <monr0e> So you're acting as a payment processor
[18:10:48] <PattyCakes> monr0e, I'm sure you know but as long as your service line is beefy enough, you can absolutely find a 200A single pole breaker

[18:12:17] <PattyCakes> oh GOD no
[18:12:25] <MJCD> I believe the % per resale thing is part of those Smart Contracts
[18:12:28] <monr0e> Which is what I think telgareith was thinking
[18:12:29] <PattyCakes> no ones residential service feed is beefy enough for that
[18:12:49] <MJCD> but basically tldr wherever it actually is, we don't have to track that
[18:12:52] <MJCD> because the chain can for us
[18:13:05] <MJCD> and the smart contracts would just pay out even sending from person to person
[18:13:13] <PattyCakes> I'm upgrading to 200A panel, and having to upgrade my line feeds as well
[18:13:16] <MJCD> as long as they're on the same chain ie etherium etc
[18:13:27] <MJCD> atleast such is my understanding >.>
[18:13:40] <MJCD> this is why I need a neckbeard probably named Josh
[18:13:43] <monr0e> MJCD: So let me get this straight: You're a payment processor for what is essentially an NFT merchant, and you want to rely on the blockchain to prove transactions in order to limit your record-keeping obligations?
[18:13:43] <MJCD> or like... David.
[18:13:56] <MJCD> monr0e: essentially correct
[18:13:59] <monr0e> Yeah no
[18:14:05] <monr0e> Thats not how it works
[18:14:18] <MJCD> it kind of is thoooo
[18:14:29] <MJCD> not like that exactly as I say i'm no expert
[18:14:39] <PattyCakes> is this neckbeard named Josh the guy that's going to build it?
[18:14:40] <MJCD> thus why i'm looking for one to discuss options etc
[18:14:46] <bomb> TIL MJCD is a criminal
[18:14:53] <MJCD> really just advice at this stage lol
[18:15:02] <monr0e> The blockchain is purely a mathematical chain. You will still need to keep records to identify what sumation implies what transaction, only now you're adding an overhead that increases your running costs.
[18:15:06] <PattyCakes> a consultant, you're looking for a consultant
[18:15:09] <MJCD> I know what the blockchain is heh
[18:15:12] <bomb> Coinbase asks huge money to convert bitcoin to USD
[18:15:15] <MJCD> and we would keep records
[18:15:18] <MJCD> autonomously tho
[18:15:42] <bomb> unless you find a grocery store that accept cryptocurrencies, selling stuff with BTC is huge risk
[18:15:44] <monr0e> Whats different then? Paypal, for example, has an API that can be used to automate record-keeping.
[18:15:45] <MJCD> the literal whole point is it just says "Owned by <whatever>" under it and probably some contact details
[18:15:50] <MJCD> bomb: it's original media
[18:15:55] <bomb> also how long does it take to validate a BTC transaction?
[18:15:58] <MJCD> monr0e: if I send you money on paypal
[18:16:05] <MJCD> I, the vendor, am in no way part of that
[18:16:12] <MJCD> Unlike with smart contracts etc
[18:16:24] <MJCD> and a central blockchain where ownership is kept
[18:16:33] <monr0e> central!?
[18:16:35] <bomb> smart contracts are just programs
[18:16:38] <MJCD> which probably would be a ... subchain or whatever it's called
[18:16:38] <MJCD> urgh
[18:16:43] <MJCD> not central as in 1 server
[18:16:45] <MJCD> ya nong
[18:16:54] <monr0e> I know I'm just joshing. 
[18:17:12] <MJCD> I'm being pretty clear when I don't know the probably correct term
[18:17:31] <bomb> I still have ZERO clue what MJCD is doing and asking
[18:17:32] <monr0e> Point is, I don't see the point in using blockchain here - unless you're using it to provide a separate service, its not adding anything to the equation
[18:17:35] <MJCD> and again I hate all of this shit but it's a requirement to keep up with it to some degree
[18:17:53] <MJCD> bomb: dw about it, it's for the ownership and resale of original mixed media basically
[18:18:19] <bomb> MJCD has to be original, without copies? so NFT basically
[18:18:25] <MJCD> monr0e: again to my mind it largely forces certain conditions on things
[18:18:43] <MJCD> one of which is autonomously updating us about the change in ownership
[18:19:09] <MJCD> we will still keep a history of who has owned it etc entirely internally
[18:19:11] <monr0e> The only way this would make sense is if you were using the blockchain to prove ownership to the customer - in which case, your question should really have been "We're an NFT vendor and we want some help getting started"
[18:19:19] <bomb> just sell ebooks on your 100% static website using Paddle or FastSpring
[18:19:26] <MJCD> that's pretty much what I said lol
[18:19:28] <bomb> many people still buy ebooks.
[18:19:43] <MJCD> and pretty much what it is
[18:20:15] <monr0e> And that is *far* too big a conversation to be having here. You need a proper, paid up consultant
[18:20:28] <MJCD> bomb: books are possible heh
[18:20:37] <monr0e> Or, take the two or three months to learn about it yourself
[18:20:40] <MJCD> monr0e: lol nah just advice it's really a $0 enterprise
[18:20:48] <MJCD> everything will probably start selling at like $1
[18:21:07] <monr0e> I'm very confused. So you don't already have a platform?
[18:21:07] <MJCD> and again we're not doing very much at all
[18:21:57] <MJCD> we basically will just keep a record of the transactions against the blockchain for that NFT/basically UUID heh
[18:22:13] <MJCD> it's just a website, not a platform heh
[18:22:21] <MJCD> there's no trading or anything inside of it
[18:22:39] <MJCD> that's why as far as I know smart contracts will be a big factor
[18:23:25] <MJCD> less of an nft platform, more of a mixed media website on which you can buy stuff or be put in touch with who can sell it to you
[18:23:40] <monr0e> So... an auction house?
[18:23:43] <MJCD> then the smart contract will fire off independently and we can be aware of that
[18:23:43] <MJCD> nah
[18:23:53] <MJCD> more like an art gallery
[18:23:58] <MJCD> where you CAN own pieces

[18:24:32] <monr0e> So you don't get the actual product, you just... sponsor it?
[18:24:38] <MJCD> the only flag on our end will be if the current owner is interested to sell, and some details
[18:24:45] <MJCD> yeah in a way, 
[18:24:53] <MJCD> I mean you get it the same as you get any NFT :P
[18:25:03] <MJCD> ps again I really hate all these industries really badly
[18:25:19] <MJCD> it just does seem like the apt way to do <the thing> in 2022 short of making as you say, a whole nft platform
[18:25:54] <MJCD> which isn't desirable really if that's what it was i'd just chuck em on opensea/etc
[18:26:16] <monr0e> Frankly I think thats still your best option. 
[18:26:24] <MJCD> this is really a very basic self hosted site that just sits on the edge of the systems
[18:26:33] <MJCD> well, I don't think that's true clearly
[18:26:50] <MJCD> thus why i'm asking to discuss it further with someone who knows definitively
[18:27:14] <monr0e> Or, system in two parts. Frontend built like a cross between ebay/imgur, backend is just an API that interacts with the eth chain
[18:27:16] <MJCD> it's not even a real business as I say I just need some advice on the structuring and maybe further advice on the smart contracts afaik
[18:27:30] <MJCD> right that's basically what it is
[18:27:52] <MJCD> and then shows "Owned by X" or even a wallet address
[18:28:14] <monr0e> Then for the backend, go to bitcointalk or somewhere similar. That's where the expertise is. 
[18:28:18] <MJCD> if it's green they've marked it with us as for sale and shows some contact details
[18:30:38] <MJCD> this is going to end with me reading dozens of shit whitepapers on why crypto doesn't suck isn't it

[20:34:40] <Reinhilde> that's your problem. SSDs aren't ideal as a medium for the swap partition

[20:35:39] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> I mean... that's not recommended is it?
[20:36:24] <Reinhilde> it's not recommended to use an SSD as the swap partition because the SSD has much more limited write endurance than a magnetic drive
[20:37:30] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> no swap it's windows paging
[20:37:40] <Reinhilde> windows paging is swap

[20:40:29] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> Reinhilde: ram usage sometimes gets that high for long times because I run a lot of VM's on this box
[20:40:31] <mistiry> i maen, thats _highly_ dependent on the workload you apply to it
[20:40:56] <JollyRgrs> y'all forget though that swap and pagefile are used very diff from their OSes. for example, try running windows with no swap file, even with a lot of RAM, it can still cause issues. otherhand, linux, so long as you have enough ram, you don't need swap (and you can set the "swapiness" at that)
[20:41:16] <mistiry> i didnt forget that :P
[20:41:21] <Reinhilde> i'd be interested to know what the issues are without the pagefile

[20:42:07] <JollyRgrs> but as @sysadmin said there's much more to it than just that

[21:56:16] <sd> 11<tâ€‹elgareith> I think the difference is behavior
[21:56:21] <mistiry> id say transactional mail results from an action taken by a user (user submitted a form, bought an item, etc). marketing mail is unsolicited (or you agreed to it with a checkbox on a site somewhere) with a commercial purpose. and regular email is mail without a comemrcial purpose that wasnt a result of user behavior.

[22:15:09] <mistiry> but mostly looks like its geared toward what we all said - doing emails based on user actions
[22:15:32] <mistiry> password reset, form submission, More Info link clicked, etc.
[22:15:33] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> because I feel like postfix/other MTAs like Exchange with some modifications can do all of this

[22:17:41] <Reinhilde> sysadmin, it would be the same as if you used postfix, appropriately patched qmail, courier, MSExchange, etc for your personal emailn
[22:18:00] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> you probably litterly have transaction logs for transaction email servers

[22:57:53] <csws> I think amazon forces you to do it now anyway
[22:57:58] <mistiry> instead of just using a good host
[22:58:02] <mistiry> and not caring about all that shit
[22:58:12] <csws> where you delegate a subdomain, e.g. ses.hotmess.com and hte MX record points to them for sending failed deliveries etc.
[22:58:30] <csws> then they set the envelope from to blahblah@ses.hotmess.com but the mail from is me@hotmess.com, for instance

[23:32:42] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> also gotify doesn't support SSL/TLS
[23:33:04] <mistiry> their examples show them POSTing to an HTTPS link
[23:33:23] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> yeah through a reverse proxy
[23:33:28] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> it's a bit of an hassle
[23:33:50] <mistiry> their config file has cert stuff in it
[23:33:52] <mistiry> lol
[23:33:58] <mistiry> and shows using 443 as their example
[23:34:01] <mistiry> it most definitely is doing HTTPS
[23:34:16] <mistiry> hell looks like it even supports LetsEncrypt
[23:34:38] <CableNinja> not doing https in 2022 is like walking into someones house and scooting your freshly shitted ass all over the rug
[23:34:47] <CableNinja> its socially unacceptable
[23:34:52] *** Quits: csrf (~csrf@user/csrf) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:34:59] <mistiry> like theres a whole section in the config labeled "SSL"
[23:35:23] <mistiry> even a force-to-HTTPS option
[23:35:29] <mistiry> idk how you think this doesnt support https
[23:35:39] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> natively?

[23:35:48] <csws> can't you just slap caddy in front of it lol
[23:35:54] <DrZak> go tits go tits
[23:36:20] <DrZak> you can never have enough messaging tools

[23:36:52] <DrZak> but the gopher mascot is cute
[23:38:32] <csws> honestly wondering whether I should just give sysadmin an account on my gotify instance lol
[23:39:10] <bomb> give him root password so you can sue him once he screws up everything
[23:39:40] <csws> idk I don't think he has anything worth taking :(
[23:40:11] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> ok so the visit link and send notification isn't going to happen
[23:40:23] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> web browsers use GET, and this uses POST
[23:40:27] <mistiry> ...
[23:40:34] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> oh no
[23:40:41] <mistiry> so the link goes to a page that then makes the POST to gotify...
[23:40:43] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> incoming angry IRC user
[23:41:47] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> oh wow there's a javascript way to do it
[23:41:55] <mistiry> dude its just an HTTPS call
[23:41:57] <mistiry> lol
[23:41:59] <mistiry> its not magic
[23:42:01] <mistiry> of course JS can do it
[23:42:26] <technonerd> It's only 290$ for macallan 25
[23:42:41] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> sherry oak?
[23:42:54] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> where are you getting it for so cheap

[23:45:21] <bomb> I don't know you guys, but Magellan also deserved a country name like Amerigo Vespucci and Christopher Columbus.
[23:48:16] <mistiry> apparently there was a hypothesis of a southern continent existing that was named for him
[23:48:38] <mistiry> and he named the Pacific Ocean what it is, used to be Sea of Magellan, apparently

[23:48:41] <sd> 02<sâ€‹ysadmin> mistiry: i'm sorry, how would I create that page? I really suck at this stuff
[23:49:42] <mistiry> html page with js that POSTs onload would be one way
[23:49:55] <sd> 11<tâ€‹elgareith> hrm
[23:50:13] <sd> 11<tâ€‹elgareith> so theres giant luggable PV/solar systems now
[23:50:15] <sd> 11<tâ€‹elgareith> I wonder
[23:50:23] <mistiry> <body onload="document.formname.submit()">
[23:50:32] <mistiry> and in the body have a <form> with all the fields and values
[23:50:38] <mistiry> web design 101 kind of stuff
[23:50:39] <sd> 11<tâ€‹elgareith> do any of them have a EV port to let you charge them quickly?
[23:50:41] <csws> lol
[23:50:52] <csws> can you add onload="this.form.submit()" to the form element?
[23:51:07] <mistiry> probably not but ive never tried it myself
[23:51:19] <csws> I know you can do it with selection changes on combo boxes
[23:51:31] <csws> that was a little trick I'd do soemtimes
[23:51:36] <mistiry> i dont really do web design any more
[23:51:39] <mistiry> been quite a while
[23:51:44] <mistiry> HTML4 and CSS2 days
[23:51:50] <csws> it's probably completely haram to a modern js developer
[23:51:51] <csws> but shit works!
[23:53:55] <sd> 11<Hâ€‹otmess> lol who knows i am not sure what the overlap between JS devs and imam's are
