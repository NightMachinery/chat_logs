[01:34:46] <hexnewbie> Wayland's like replacing perfectly good incandescent bulbs with LCD ones: Dimming doesn't work. Then they blow up because the dimmer was damaging them. So you buy dimmer-compatible ones, and they flicker. Then you buy an LCD-compatible Legrand dimmer, and it turns out to have bugs: If you turn the light off and back on again, it never, never turns on (have to flip the circuit breaker).

[01:35:55] <hexnewbie> s/LCD/LED/; also at maximum brightness, the dimmer would bug out and start *blinking* an SOS signal. And you can't turn them off when there's a power outage. So if you're off to a vacation, you have to leave your lights on the entire vacation

[03:35:19] <xx> unlike most, I don't actually have a music library or video library or whatever to use as a test
[03:35:28] <uwharrie> DNSSEC is a technology for authenticating/validating/signing DNS records, DoT is for querying DNS over TLS, and DoH is for querying DNS over HTTP(S)
[03:35:55] <CodeSpelunker> xx: maybe "dd if=/dev/urandom of=<file_name> bs=1 count=<num of bytes>"
[03:36:12] <CodeSpelunker> I forget the syntax, but something like that.  Also, careful with dd
[03:36:23] <xx> CodeSpelunker: yeah, I can script that, but was wondering if there already is a tool that generates a nice set of files
[03:36:25] <uwharrie> wouldn't you prefer to use something like badblocks instead?

[03:37:47] <CodeSpelunker> that seems like the easiest way to me.  dd in a loop
[03:38:09] <CodeSpelunker> if you want a little more customization, a python script would be how i'd go

[03:46:11] <xx> CodeSpelunker: don't care, no need for it to be cryptographically random

[03:47:49] <FlorianBad> jim: What's crazy with that stupid ChromeOS thing is that it won't allow me to see my other partitions from ChromeOS. e.g. I mounted some of them in the same location where it mounts USBs that you insert (/media/removable/DISK_NAME) and I cannot see it in the Files app... So to transfer files I'll have to use a USB drive lol
[03:47:55] <xx> yeah I was hoping someone already had a tool that does what I need, instead of having to write it myself. Surely someone needed to generate a set of testfiles at some point.

[05:55:28] <Khaytsus> ;)
[05:55:38] <rbox> Khaytsus: i have it set up to automatically grab the first exposed port, and forward 80 to it, with hostname based on the name of the container
[05:56:28] <ananke> Khaytsus: right, but once you get it up, you can configure your services by adding few tags onto each service container. no need to configure the front-end service
[05:56:39] <Khaytsus> Interesting
[05:56:40] <pnbeast> I had a laptop open, today, and I think it had the cats whiskers, two thirds of its back, belly and leg hair and most of its tail hair.  Now I think it runs a little more quietly.

[07:37:41] <matsaman> OnkelBlade: implementation specific
[07:37:47] <matsaman> OnkelBlade: and even hardware specific
[07:37:51] <sheep> it depends on the hardware and the drivers
[07:38:02] <ayecee> that's a long way to say i don't know
[07:38:07] * rbox drives pnbeast 
[07:38:18] <OnkelBlade> hehe
[07:38:39] <matsaman> OnkelBlade: on the software side, what you can do is sleep while saving info in RAM, or in non-RAM storage (hard disks, etc.), or you can power off everything but enough to allow for signals to power back on
[07:38:44] <TudbuTD> my laptop for example sometimes gets out of sync with its display after sleeping, in that case i just make it sleep again and wake it up again, it has a 50% chance of happening so yeah
[07:38:44] <Henry151> i found my lost data
[07:38:54] <sheep> in general, peripheral devices are put in a low power mode or shut off completely. If they're shut off then their state has to be restored correctly when its power is returned, but sometimes that doesn't happen right
[07:39:02] <ayecee> was it in the last place you'd ever look?
[07:39:07] <OnkelBlade> Well, ok. Then a more specific question. Should be a PC still available via LAN in the sleep mode?
[07:39:14] <ayecee> OnkelBlade: no
[07:39:16] <Dagmar> Nope.
[07:39:23] <matsaman> OnkelBlade: one bad thing that can happen is you can have more to store during sleep than you have space to store
[07:39:38] <matsaman> OnkelBlade: and if you interrupt the process at any point, whether you have the space or not, that can make it all fall over

[07:41:39] <OnkelBlade> I see. Well, I have two PCs and just witessed a weird LAN behaviour. I couldn't even ping one (A) from another (B) - was receiving "Destination unreachable". At that, I could ping the router from either one.
[07:42:04] <matsaman> OnkelBlade: and their IPs?
[07:42:11] <Dagmar> Wireless, yes?
[07:42:39] <ayecee> was one of them sleeping
[07:42:44] <OnkelBlade> Then, once I pinged B from A (i.e. reverse) - 1) that pinged worked and 2) "Destination unreachable" immediatly went away from B and it continued to ping A!
[07:42:56] <OnkelBlade> Dagmar: A is wireless, B - wired
[07:43:07] <Dagmar> Yes, one of them has bad network configuration parameters

[07:47:53] <Dagmar> The working one would get a response to ARP, send that packet out, and _voila_ now the broken host has the other host's IP address in it's ARP cache and will now shortcut routing
[07:48:17] <rbox> what about the shave?
[07:48:20] <ayecee> my bet is that it's responding to the wired arp on the wifi, and the wifi AP is dropping it because the source address doesn't belong

[08:36:50] <Dagmar> ...which is telling it to mount a remote NFS server.
[08:37:02] <Dagmar> If that NFS server is _unreachable_ that could perhaps be having some side-effects.
[08:37:04] <tirnanog> it's not the server name in isolation, Dagmar, but the fact that the request path is passed through unmodified (that's what happens when the proxy_path value isn't a URI as is documentd). so you end up with a request path of /gitea being passed through *unmodified* to the upstream proxy. _that_ is almost certainly what causes a 404 from gitea itself. now, you could add a trailing slash to proxy_path
[08:37:06] <tirnanog> which would effectively rewrite the request path. but that could break things in other ways.
[08:37:24] <Dagmar> tirnanog: Ah.. and things like that are why I stick with Apache
[08:37:33] <Dagmar> It's also insane, but it's a type of insanity I've gotten used to
[08:37:35] <tirnanog> now, if the proxy_path value were to have a trailing slash, it would rewrite the request path (sort of how aliases work) but, as you had alluded to, it could break things in other ways.
[08:37:49] <GaM3r2Xtreme> OK, let me play around with the regex suggestion and the = / too for the first location tag. I will have to read up on the hostname ideas too since I'm not too sure why they would need to be adjusted yet (limited nginx knowledge as of now).
[08:37:55] <tirnanog> so, a distinct server_name + a proxy_path that does no request path rewriting in location / context is the logical approach.

[08:48:28] <tirnanog> GaM3r2Xtreme: if you add a trailing slash, it will strip off /gitea/ but then you have the problem that gitea has no idea it's supposed to present links that bebin with /gitea/ (for nginx's request path handling) thereafter. possibly fixable in gitea's own settings.
[08:49:07] <tirnanog> GaM3r2Xtreme: if you have a mismatch between the request path nginx processes and that which the application expects, it's always harder to maintain.

[09:04:08] <tirnanog> GaM3r2Xtreme: the point of having a distinct vhost is that you no longer have to map requests between disparate paths (/gitea to / in this case). instead it's / to /.
[09:05:12] <greeb> Dagmar: cloud has a lot to do with that I think. Older admins with bare metal experience are retiring from the workforce and younger admins with more cloud experience and less unix-workalike proper experience is gonna make for a rough transition, especially since academic and research institutions still have large bare metal infrastructures and will be among the last to inevitably transition to a
[09:05:14] <greeb> cloud provider.
[09:05:15] <tirnanog> but if you don't want to do that, you need to go into gitea's settings and figure out whether it can be told to use a base path that is in agreement with your nginx location.

[09:09:30] <greeb> Cloud is way more forgiving when it comes to support roles, is what I'm getting at. Deep dive troubleshooting on cloud or bare metal requires experienced admin chops, but what I'm seeing is that admin roles are doled out to people with cloud certificates and not a whole lot of Unix or mainstream RFC experience.

[09:10:02] <GaM3r2Xtreme> I think I'm starting to get what your saying with the prepend of /gitea we are still having to go through nginx each time to redirect to the gitea. I think the next steps I need to take is read up on hostnames, server_name, and the /etc/hosts a bit more to get a better understanding of what's all happening.

[09:17:07] <Dagmar> With the telephone thing above, if you're nginx and you have a "server_name Steve" directive, you'd answer steve's phone and answer questions based on what's in the server block containing that server_name Steve directive, and NOT the block containing the "server_name UrActualName"

[10:42:53] <tirnanog> yeah. arch is mostly on the cutting edge.

[10:44:12] <tirnanog> gentoo is a bit more flexible and that it lets software settle for a while before marking as stable, and you can choose the versions (within reason). arch is really better suited for where you want upstream packages, fast and with minimal modifications (for better or worse).
[10:44:32] <packet_lozenge> i haven't installed Arch in a while, but it was a pretty functional installer. it does not hold your hand, though

[14:43:41] <mrfb> yeah, snaps for desktop/server is the horrid change of this century

[14:44:14] <mrfb> I'd burn the nuts of the stellar genious who decided to spoonfeed it to regular ubuntu with acid
[14:44:58] <MrElendig> mrfb: its "kindof" fine for desktop (just slow as hell and impossible to find your configs), but on server its just "wtf mate?"

[14:45:13] <mrfb> snaps are fine on ubuntu-core, where you manage automated updates and tools like kiosks and things like that, but on the desktop is just horrid
[14:45:21] <MrElendig> that they wanted to use it for server stuff is probably a reason why they didn't go flatpak
[14:45:42] <mrfb> I kind of know the reasons

[14:46:00] <mrfb> and it's really great
[14:46:09] <MrElendig> mrfb: I've had a bunch of random breakage of snap that would make me really sceptical about using it in production
[14:46:09] <mrfb> (the reason canonical started to make some money)
[14:46:24] <mrfb> yeah MrElendig that's the thing
[14:46:44] <mrfb> the great advantage of snaps is also a pain on production servers
[14:47:52] <mrfb> if you have to update like 2000 POS kiosks, it's a breeze with ubuntu core. But having a production server update itself and for some reason not booting up with no other warning than your client yelling you on the phone...
[14:47:56] <MrElendig> have had the snap daemon itself crash quite a lot of times
[14:47:58] <mrfb> that's not fun at all
[14:48:38] <MrElendig> also they had an update where they shipped a broken apparmor config which was fun
[14:49:10] <mrfb> I have a love/hate relationship with ubuntu XD
[14:49:10] <MrElendig> broken for snap that is
[14:49:25] <mrfb> due snaps, but not because most people reasons, we actually work with snaps
[14:49:55] <mrfb> yes I understand, that wouldn't be a problem if you could decide WHEN you apply an update

[14:50:36] <mrfb> snaps are flawed in many ways, they recycled the technology from the failed Ubuntu mobile project
[14:50:43] <MrElendig> its more that they clearly didn't actually test the update
[14:50:49] <MrElendig> which leaves a bad taste

[17:04:38] <cerl> Just use emacs if you're going to be opening multiple text documents.
[17:04:39] <clemens3> then use find and pipes and a while read file do loop
[17:04:50] <BCMM> Intelo: why does it need to be done within vim? does your vim setup have some way of knowing which files are part of the "project", or is this actually just a directory with multiple files in it?
[17:04:55] <clemens3> if he wants to do each file to invoke by hand
[17:04:58] <Intelo> well how to give path /dirs tree  to sed

[17:05:26] <BCMM> Intelo: i think it's usually done with find -exec

[19:27:21] <Gaboradon> Hi
[19:27:28] <Prutz> hi
[19:27:42] <Gaboradon> Is it possible to run GUI applications without DE, does DE literally provide the GFX for a window to appear?
[19:27:59] <Gaboradon> Or it'll just be borderless, without buttons and controls ?
[19:28:10] <mrfb> you can run on top of bare Xorg
[19:28:13] <greeb> X or Wayland is what is required
[19:28:16] *** Joins: Gooberpatrol66 (~Gooberpat@user/gooberpatrol66)
[19:28:21] <BCMM> Gaboradon: your second line there is correct, assuming it's Xorg not wayland, and by DE you mean WM
[19:28:23] <mrfb> but not sure if you really want that
[19:28:57] *** Quits: node1 (~hex@user/node1) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:29:36] <BCMM> Gaboradon: but yeah, you can run an application with just the X server and no windows manager. you get no windows decorations and also basically no way to move windows around
[19:30:08] <BCMM> also, with no WM the default X11 behaviour is focus-follows-mouse - click to focus is a WM feature

[19:31:02] <BCMM> Gaboradon: it may or may not require a working WM to go full-screen properly
[19:31:23] <Gaboradon> I do know about that, in this case I would like to run a graphics aplication without any DE, but I would need a core window provider ?
[19:31:27] <BCMM> there's altogether too many way to be fullscreen...
[19:31:31] <mrfb> Gaboradon: instead of rambling thoughts, what do you want exactly?
[19:31:47] <BCMM> Gaboradon: ok, what's a "window provider"? that sounds like it could mean either window manager or display server

[19:37:26] <Gaboradon> I would like to bring it down to the least amount of dependencies, that's the main goal, if only display server is needed, that's good too, avoids having a full DE. But if I could avoid the display server too that be even better (eventually perhaps not, but it may work as a side-project proof of concept)
[19:37:36] <BCMM> Gaboradon: if you just want to run Xorg and then run a fullscreen game on top of Xorg with no other GUI applications, then yes, that works and some people actually do it
[19:37:57] <Gaboradon> Indeed yes, no other GUI application is needed is what I forgot to mention.
[19:38:09] <grodzio> just the xorg server should be enough then
[19:38:27] <Gaboradon> What would be the Wayland's equivalent tho?
[19:38:34] <grodzio> i don't think it would hurt if you used a lightweight window manager on top of that like cwm or dwm
[19:38:42] <greeb> use a window manager like fluxbox or blackbox if you want to get into lightweight windowing environments or zero windowing environment, learn how to mess around with the underlying X11 implementation for your chosen distro, read manuals too, then go from there.
[19:38:53] <BCMM> Gaboradon: most applications require a display server. a quite small number of applications are designed to work totally standalone

[19:40:15] <Gaboradon> Sure sure, when I go down to actually doing it, it won't be just user tweaking it'll involve being an actual dev, however I needed to know if it's actually possible before I commit to it because to get to it there's a bunch of work I need to do first, which would go to waste if I end up in a brick wall.

[19:51:07] <BCMM> linux is linux, and "embedded" distros can run on standard hardware (e.g. there's lots of x86 routers running openwrt). i'm only talking about the embedded world because that's where techniques like running directly on the FB to reduce dependencies tend to come from

This should be future proof so why not start off with Wayland. It probably would be worth it to do some work if I have to split the display server out manually.

[20:26:29] <djph> Gaboradon: well, if you want to avoid a DE, then just run a WM instead (i3wm, awesomewm, etc come to mind)
[20:26:48] <BCMM> Gaboradon: i'm saying you just need one tiny component of the desktop environment (or one of the many standalone WMs that aren't affiliated with a desktop environment)

[20:27:25] <Gaboradon> Is there a list of standalone WMs which aren't affiliated with any DE?
[20:27:31] <msiism> Yes.
[20:27:42] <ananke> if only wikipedia could have lists of those
[20:27:44] <BCMM> Gaboradon: to clarify, on Xorg you actually don't even need a WM, for a fullscreen application. but in the Wayland future, the WM has assumed the responsibilities of the display server
[20:27:56] <Ckat> !aw windowmanager
[20:28:00] <ananke> ohh, here it is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_window_managers
[20:28:08] <msiism> Gaboradon: https://www.gilesorr.com/wm
[20:28:08] <MrElendig> Gaboradon: that would be every wm except kwin, xfwm4 and mutter
[20:28:11] <Ckat> https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Window_manager#List_of_window_managers heres an arch flavored list
[20:28:11] <MrElendig> basically
[20:28:30] <BCMM> (or, strictly speaking, the compositor has assumed hte responsibilities of the display server, but *usually* the compositor is part of the window manager, so forget i said this bit)
[20:28:37] <Gaboradon> So to review this idea then. I would install and configure barebone Arch, kernel -> DRM/KMS -> X11 Server -> WM -> My App
[20:29:09] <BCMM> Gaboradon: DRM/KMS are part of the kernel
[20:29:36] <Gaboradon> understood yes I pointed it out the path a bit more in detail.
[20:30:01] <Ckat> also the wm can be rather passive
[20:30:11] <Ckat> its more X11 server -> x client (aka your app)
[20:30:15] <Gaboradon> Right from practical view it's the wrong flow sure.
[20:30:29] <Prutz> I've checked endevours website. Looks great! May'be when Manjaro is fcked up I'll switch to it.
[20:30:36] <BCMM> Gaboradon: what you've just drawn is a decent representation of the graphics stack, except that the WM can arguably be put *next to* the app, as well as beneath it
