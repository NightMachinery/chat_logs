[00:15:46] <rpav> i wish the language were powerful enough to express temporaries as types and error if you stored them _or their members_
[00:16:21] <rpav> i think you'd need like custom qualifiers

[00:19:23] <rpav> ah so probably you'd need some way to be like `qualifier<Q> S s;` and `void foo() if(Q) { ... }` ðŸ¤”

[01:13:44] <johnny> conan folks sure are gonna have a harder time than most to solve packaging problems
[01:14:08] <johnny> i haven't yet used it, but it's amazing to me that it works at all (based on what other people say anyways)
[01:17:19] <rpav> it's a bit overengineered
[01:17:52] <rpav> it does do good things, like understanding "hey people might like to build for various architectures and with various settings" .. it's mostly how it accomplishes that is clunky
[01:18:40] <rpav> actually it's unclear why we don't use something like what gentoo has, except generalized to support multiple builds

[01:22:02] <johnny> what is "overengineered" about it?
[01:22:17] <johnny> i'm always wary whenever somebody says that
[01:22:37] <johnny> probably not the case here, but i'm really used to hearing it by people who don't actually understand the problems something is solving
[01:22:42] <johnny> it's one of those loaded words to me
[01:26:01] <johnny> i'm really not used to dealing with non system level package managers in which delivering precompiled bits is a first class operation
[01:26:19] <rpav> probably not the best way to describe it i guess; conan is trying to solve a hard problem, don't get me wrong .. the problem isn't that it's complex, it's that the approaches taken to accomplish things are rough and not very nice in a lot of ways
[01:26:35] <johnny> do you feel like they didn't learn from existing approaches?
[01:26:45] <kalven> so under-engineered? :)
[01:26:54] <AmR> Any one know mingw-w64 ?
[01:26:57] <johnny> i've never used it, but i think if i were to create a package manager, i'd start with prior art
[01:27:19] <johnny> and get myself a sat solver
[01:27:22] <rpav> its design was clearly approached from the "we're going to support every conceivable approach to building" to _start_ with, with with a lot of like "let's assume all things are best done by X" which is indicative of more exploratory development
[01:27:56] <johnny> yeah that sounds underengineered
[01:27:57] <AmR> Where I can find HAVE_VALUES_H) #include <values.h> ?
[01:28:26] <johnny> AmR, never used mingw.. i stick with building with msvc on windows, and gcc/clang elsewhere
[01:28:44] <johnny> although i guess if i were more concerned about cross compiling i'd setup mingw on the linux side
[01:29:03] <rpav> johnny: yeah i usually mean "people who didn't really know what they were doing tossed everything they could think of into a pot and also invented a thing to stir with" when i say "overengineered"
[01:29:31] <johnny> i think it's generous to call it engineered
[01:29:45] <rpav> well, it's meant facetiously, so yeah

[01:30:06] <AmR> johnny: Now I test the build with mssy2
[01:30:32] <johnny> didn't cargo, pypi and npm already exist byu the time cargo started?
[01:30:45] <rpav> https://github.com/spack/spack <- that looks f'n awesome otoh; if only it _supported god damn windows_
[01:30:48] <johnny> err by the time conan started
[01:30:49] <jokoon> struct thing { void thing::function();}; is that legal is some version of C++ or visual studio?
[01:30:51] <kalven> I think when people say "overengineered", they mean that it's a solution more complex than needed - this is of couse often paired with not understanding the full scope of the problem, as johnny said.
[01:30:51] <rpav> and i say this as someone who is not a fan of windows
[01:30:59] *** Joins: Burgundy (~yomon@86.127.194.72)
[01:31:03] <rpav> but i have to build there and it needs to support it to be useful
[01:31:29] <johnny> package management is hard enough, one shouldn't put up roadblocks yourself
[01:31:30] <rpav> or at least, the cppcon? presentation made it look a lot sleeker and still do all the right things vs conan
[01:31:49] <rpav> dunno
[01:32:00] <johnny> first you support the main use cases, like ./configure && make, and whatever you do on windows
[01:32:09] <rpav> gentoo's thing certainly did and i'm actually not sure what it lacks, other than multiple-binary management
[01:32:18] <johnny> get yourself some metadata and versioning , and a sat solver
[01:32:41] <johnny> do the basic stuff to get just those things working, and you've already got a reasonable system
[01:33:03] <rpav> johnny: yeah that absolutely is the way to do things
[01:33:18] <rpav> simple start, then expand
[01:33:44] <rpav> vcpkg has the simple start; it just doesn't look like it has any plans to go beyond "simple"

[01:34:12] <johnny> reasonably*
[01:35:16] <johnny> and heck, we've got enough experience now to show how one can migrate metadata , which issn't something that was thought much about at the time when folks first started doing this
[01:35:27] <johnny> there's just an incredible amount of prior art that it feels like they totally ignored
[01:36:10] <PJBoy> looking at prior art isn't the pragmatic approach required to make a new standard
[01:36:18] <johnny> huh?
[01:36:22] <rpav> well conan also wants to manage packages and distribution and data as abstract objects that exist on some server, and a server is basically compulsory.. packages are never files
[01:36:36] <rpav> PJBoy: i think you mean "isn't the idealistic approach required"
[01:36:41] <rpav> because it is very much pragmatic
[01:36:50] <PJBoy> I was trying to be funny
[01:36:57] <rpav> ah that's the other option :)

[01:39:07] <johnny> pypi does at least an ok job of giving you prebuild binaries as python wheels if they exist, but then downloading the source and building for you if they don't
[01:39:21] <johnny> well with pip and other package managers anyways .. sorry :(
[01:39:42] <johnny> and you can say, actually don't give me the binaries even if you have them
[01:39:49] <rpav> pip/npm/etc are nice but are also solving a vastly simpler problem
[01:40:15] <PJBoy> reddit would have me believe that pip is evil
[01:40:34] <rpav> when "distribute proprietary binaries with configured options" is also a feature you must support things get a bit more complicated
[01:40:37] <johnny> well actually i hate pip myself , because i want something more like pdm :)
[01:40:46] <rpav> PJBoy: it's kinda crap but it's like, fine i guess
[01:40:53] <rpav> i hate python but what can you do
[01:40:55] <johnny> rpav, that's the main value add of conan isn't it
[01:41:06] <rpav> johnny: not sure tbh
[01:41:08] <johnny> but first the other stuff should be handled decent
[01:41:18] <rpav> my main value add is "i don't care how dependency D was built, i can use it with build system B"
[01:41:26] <rpav> and don't get me wrong that's pretty nice
[01:41:28] <PJBoy> pip has no update command, but otherwise it works really well for me

[01:41:50] <rpav> and at the same time a bit brittle
[01:42:08] <johnny> PJBoy, i much prefer to have project local deps which pip doesn't support

[13:39:17] <PJBoy> and it is portable, it's defined by the C++ standard
[13:40:02] <MaddHatter> so now you need to conditionalize your code *and* tell users to change their default configs. Very helpful.
[13:40:23] <TinoDidriksen> You always have to change default compiler configs.

[13:40:36] <PJBoy> lets be real here
[13:41:16] <MaddHatter> people generally use the compiler settings that they need or that work for their project, and the less you impose on that the easier you make their lives

[13:42:20] <PJBoy> and it's extremely easy to set
[13:42:33] <PJBoy> it's irritating that it's not the default, butyeah
[13:42:38] <PJBoy> not a problem
[13:42:58] <MaddHatter> I mean, if you want to be highly opinionated about configs, go have fun with it. It wouldn't be the first project whose opinions didn't fit the reality of my environment and I had to fork or avoid them as a result.

[13:47:24] <TinoDidriksen> Those are clearly unreasonable. But requiring adherence to the standard is reasonable.
[13:47:46] <TinoDidriksen> A bare minimum, really.
[13:49:03] <MaddHatter> I don't think any compilers strictly adheres to everything in the standard exactly

[13:50:01] <TinoDidriksen> A minimum initial config is to make the compiler as close to standard as possible, then tweak from there.

[14:21:00] <PJBoy> MaddHatter, that's the robustness principle
[14:21:15] <PJBoy> and I agree with you insofar as that
[14:22:38] <PJBoy> so if you were in a header only library or something like that where you don't have any say in the environment
[14:22:54] <LordKalma> very_sneaky, and ashafq_, this is why I say I'm not a programmer: https://i.imgur.com/DTks8Kc.jpg
[14:22:55] <PJBoy> then you're probably right to not rely on __cplusplus
[14:23:27] <PJBoy> being a non software engineer doesn't stop you from being a programmer
[14:23:28] <LordKalma> build systems like cmake you can say what exact features your compiler needs to support
[14:23:48] <LordKalma> or generically some standard
[14:24:08] <LordKalma> MSVC for example is famous for an old ass __cplusplus macro that means nothing unless you enable a compiler flag
[14:24:10] <PJBoy> would you provide a cmake lists with a header only library?
[14:24:31] <LordKalma> sure, why not?
[14:24:33] <PJBoy> that's something I haven't thought about before
[14:24:50] <LordKalma> if nothing else, in the age of conan and vcpkg, assuming a canonical target name is actually helpful
[14:24:51] <PJBoy> yeah it makes sense
[14:25:15] <LordKalma> and yeah, with a build system you can provide canonical include paths, target names in the case of cmake, and better express your requirements
[14:25:20] <LordKalma> better than a readme.md
[14:28:52] <LordKalma> also
[14:29:05] <LordKalma> shouldn't your library have tests? how are they performed? maybe with... a build system?
[14:29:20] <LordKalma> shouldn't your library be installeable on unix systems? maybe with... cmake?
[14:29:32] <LordKalma> there's a miriad of reasons to use a build system on a header only lib
[14:29:33] <PJBoy> do header only libraries get installed?
[14:29:45] <LordKalma> they can go to usr/include? I guess?
[14:30:01] <LordKalma> as in, a packager would make yourlib-dev an apt package?
[14:30:11] <PJBoy> my understanding on header only libraries is to completely subvert any kind of build system crap

[14:30:30] <LordKalma> t
[14:30:39] <PJBoy> yeah like that
[14:30:51] <LordKalma> the thing is. If you already have to use a build system for tests and shit, why not make it right and complete?
[14:30:54] <LordKalma> win-win?
[14:31:06] <PJBoy> sounds sensible enough
[14:31:09] <MaddHatter> It is kind of nice not having to make 38 different configurations to cover all the permutations of binaries one needs
[14:31:38] <LordKalma> at least I would deffo ship a cmake lists file
[14:31:44] <LordKalma> and a WELL WRITTEN one
[14:31:55] <LordKalma> that you can fetchContent and Just Work (TM)
[14:32:03] <LordKalma> but really works, not the Tom Howard way
[14:32:14] <PJBoy> would you tell CMake to install the headers to /usr/include or whatever?
[14:32:19] <MaddHatter> I haven't really used cmake yet. Eventually, probably.
[14:32:29] <PJBoy> maybe without the hardcoded path of
[14:32:31] <PJBoy> c
[14:32:42] <LordKalma> PJBoy, that's configurable by the end user, but you can have sensible defaults, uyes

[14:39:26] <MaddHatter> no, it's still /usr/include but /usr is a symlink to / now. So it's /include, but with extra work.

[15:06:54] <AmR> Can I inlude cmake lib project to FetchContent ?
[15:14:07] <very_sneaky> LordKalma: have you got any good examples of a cmake recipe that optionally includes conan support? if that is a desirable thing to have
[15:14:23] <LordKalma> that's not what I meant
[15:14:28] <very_sneaky> i mean, ideally the build recipe is abstracted away from a package manager
[15:14:39] <very_sneaky> or vice versa
[15:14:50] <LordKalma> what I meant is that when you write a cmake file, you're deciding things like the canonical target names for your library
[15:15:03] <LordKalma> so when i write conan files I don't have to make stuff up
[15:15:15] <LordKalma> which someone at vcpkg might do different
[15:15:24] <very_sneaky> yeah, agree
[15:15:40] <LordKalma> that said, writing even reuse friendly cmake is *hard* art and little to nobody does it right
[15:15:40] <very_sneaky> i was just asking out of the blue, not based on something you'd said earlier
[15:15:55] <LordKalma> like moving *everything* that's not mandatory to presets and etc
[15:16:29] <very_sneaky> i watched a few packaging related talks this past week, one by one of the vcpkg maintainers on how to write good build recipes from a packaging perspective - one of the points was don't make it specific to an individual package manager
[15:16:37] <very_sneaky> was wondering how to practically approach that
[15:16:47] <LordKalma> when I finish this fucking JS project I'll get back to my lib project and then I'll have something to show
[15:16:54] <LordKalma> that talk from the vcpkg dude was weird...
[15:17:12] <very_sneaky> he certainly had a few opinions
[15:17:24] <very_sneaky> bucking the trend by saying "use cmake globbing as much as you can"
[15:17:54] <LordKalma> yeah... don't do that
[15:18:01] <LordKalma> I didn't like his talk at all
[15:18:16] <very_sneaky> i mean i udnerstood his point from a package managers perspective - i can see how it makes life easier for him
[15:18:45] <LordKalma> vcpkg decided to make life harder themselves by writing the thing in cmake of all thing
[15:18:47] <LordKalma> things*
[15:19:19] <very_sneaky> lol did they
[15:19:21] <LordKalma> 1824 currently on vcpkg.. 1000 and little on conan...
[15:19:26] <very_sneaky> interesting choice
[15:19:28] <LordKalma> conan doesn't have MS money though ahah
[15:19:39] <LordKalma> yeah, the whole thing revolves around cmake
[15:19:50] <very_sneaky> 1133 on conan
[15:20:05] <very_sneaky> that's actually more than i expected given the 1000 recipe celebration was like a month ago
[15:20:14] <LordKalma> it's definitely less boilerplatey on vcpkg when the lib is already a cmake one, but for fucks sake
[15:20:16] <LordKalma> yeah, indeed
[15:20:33] <LordKalma> it was nice to the see the faces of them folks
[15:20:41] <LordKalma> Uilies, Chris, and the others
[15:20:50] <very_sneaky> having written a few conan recipes now, i think I'm growing to appreciate it
[15:20:52] <very_sneaky> yeah for sure
[15:21:43] <very_sneaky> i like that it's in python. maybe just because i know python already though so it's one thing less that i have to learn
[15:22:55] <LordKalma> it's nice to have an actual general programming language to do general programming language tasks when things don't get trivial
[15:23:07] <LordKalma> like my liquid.dsp recipe, which needs total 100% re-write
[15:23:10] <very_sneaky> agree
[15:23:18] <very_sneaky> have you had any exposure to meson?
[15:23:22] <LordKalma> no
[15:23:25] <LordKalma> and no thanks
[15:23:38] <very_sneaky> i found it really strange that one of the pro's that they were describing was explicitly that it's not turing complete
[15:23:40] <LordKalma> cmake is used by like 55% of devs. and it does what I need, from building to shipping
[15:23:59] <LordKalma> including qt adding cmake tooling to easy deployment on 6.3
[15:24:11] <LordKalma> Craig Scott is doing amazing work working as a contract to Qt
[15:24:15] <very_sneaky> oh nice.

[15:24:38] <very_sneaky> i watched that talk literally 2 days after signing a contract for someone else to do basically the same thing in our org
[15:24:50] <very_sneaky> i didn't realise he did contractor services
[15:24:59] <LordKalma> it's all he does

[18:56:57] <jkaye> cart_man, are you referring to writing the actual tests (with something like GTest), or designing a code/system to be testable? Or both, or something entirely different :)
[18:58:18] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[18:58:36] <cart_man> jkaye: No anything that can give me a good idea on how the general setup of C++ testing goes. I mostly wrote my own little injections into modular testing for C++ but I dont think it will fly in a big corp etc
[18:58:50] <cart_man> So yea anything really haha
[19:00:15] <jkaye> I have always really enjoyed writing tests with https://github.com/google/googletest
[19:01:36] <jkaye> For injection there are a few ways to go, including runtime polymorphism (virtual inheritance), compile-time polymorphism (via template/policy-based design), dependency inversion (rely on the data that you need rather than the "generator" of that data), many others.. Most of that is not really C++ specific though (other than the template part of course)
[19:02:33] <jkaye> Personally I'm a fan of minimizing dependencies and passing data wherever possible. Many mocks is a bit of a smell imo, though sometimes it is necessary for performance reasons or interacting with older codebases etc

[21:21:52] <PJBoy> ah the perfect introduction to an emotionally charged discussion amongst nerds

[21:22:53] <LordKalma> but there doesn't seem to be a coordinated project to do so
[21:23:05] <PJBoy> yeah I've sussed that out from the discussion
[21:23:07] <LordKalma> also MAUI is the name of a KDE-based UI kit, older than .net MAUI

[21:26:27] <PJBoy> community support works :D
[21:26:36] <LordKalma> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gvr0d1vTQ4 this was the community standup where they did say something about linux being community
[21:28:40] <LordKalma> PJBoy, https://github.com/dotnet/maui/tree/a66b012a1c5aa2a194f8d96dfe9921862ecc3f29#xamarinforms-vs-net-maui
[21:28:44] <LordKalma> they had this back then
[21:28:47] <LordKalma> check the table
[21:29:38] <PJBoy> so linux was community supported in xamarin forms too?
[21:30:52] <LordKalma> there was like some gtk# bindings
[21:31:17] <LordKalma> or backend, I should say
[21:31:27] <PJBoy> hmmm
[21:31:32] <PJBoy> still
[21:31:42] <PJBoy> looks like a good move to go to MAUI for my android stuff
[21:32:04] <PJBoy> or avalonia of course :)
[21:33:41] <PJBoy> sure does add weight to the claim that new C# GUI frameworks come out on a ~two year basis
[21:33:43] <LordKalma> Uno.Platform would probably be better for mobile
[21:34:04] <PJBoy> uni platform is news to me
[21:34:42] <LordKalma> https://platform.uno/
[21:34:55] <LordKalma> older than Avalonia, works pretty much everywhere
[21:34:57] <PJBoy> yeah I'm just waiting for that website to load
[21:35:10] <LordKalma> thee website was clearly build with WASM
[21:35:13] <LordKalma> so it takes ages to load
[21:35:27] <PJBoy> still waiting...
[21:35:29] <LordKalma> like this one: https://gallery.platform.uno/

[21:36:11] <PJBoy> that took about as long to load as it takes me to compile openssl >_>
[21:36:20] <rpav> that shit is heavy ;/
[21:36:25] <LordKalma> rpav, sorry, the gallery is wasm
[21:36:43] <rpav> ah
[21:36:45] <LordKalma> the main pave is heavy yes, but js
[21:36:54] <LordKalma> anyway, it looks good, Uno, that is
[21:36:55] <PJBoy> any reason you suggest it?
[21:37:03] <PJBoy> over say avalonia or MAUI
[21:37:03] <LordKalma> the fraken-project is a bit weird
[21:37:14] <LordKalma> PJBoy, Avalonia is desktop first
[21:37:18] <LordKalma> With Uno you get wasm too
[21:37:19] <LordKalma> so idk
[21:37:23] <PJBoy> ah ok noted
[21:37:38] <PJBoy> ideally I'd just try all these frameworks and see what sticks
[21:37:39] <LordKalma> MAUI would be perfectly adequated for mobile or non-linux desktop and def the first opion
[21:37:45] <PJBoy> but they all take so much commitment
[21:37:48] <LordKalma> then Avalonia for desktop-only (mobilei s a preview)

[21:39:23] <PJBoy> well I sure as hell don't wanna write native iOS
[21:39:31] <LordKalma> rpav, actually Avalonia is SKIA basically
[21:39:37] <rpav> D:
[21:39:37] <LordKalma> Uno is a mix of things depending on the platform
[21:39:46] <rpav> oh this is for actual platforms, not web shit
[21:39:49] <LordKalma> Uno does use half-native things
[21:39:57] <LordKalma> rpav, hah yes
[21:40:01] <rpav> skia is pretty heavy _for the desktop_ though
[21:40:16] <LordKalma> even .net MAUI uses SKIA to some extent anyway hahah
[21:40:39] <rpav> probably not another great option though ;/
[21:40:52] <PJBoy> skia seems like a promising framework
[21:41:01] <PJBoy> I just have terrible memories of trying to use it on windows
[21:41:10] <PJBoy> and have nothing good to say about its docs
[21:41:15] <rpav> it was pretty rough last time i looked at it

[21:43:21] <LordKalma> "On iOS, Android and macOS, the Uno Platform relies on the current Xamarin Native stack (not Xamarin.Forms), which will be a part of the future .NET 5 / .NET 6."
[21:43:23] <PJBoy> integrating any kind of gui library with windows is a task of reverse engineering anyway
[21:43:26] <LordKalma> "On WebAssembly, the Uno Platform relies directly on the Mono-WASM runtime, a part of.NET 5."

[21:45:34] <PJBoy> I mean in terms of having a windows program and wanting to use a gui library
[21:45:41] <LordKalma> TheGuestMovie, I've looked into Avalonia, but trying C# was pretty hard haha
[21:45:54] <LordKalma> WHAT A FUCKING HUGE language and stdlib
[21:46:03] <PJBoy> BeginPaint gives me a context, and I wanna pass that context to stuff that knows how to draw graphics
[21:46:09] <LordKalma> second, Avalonia: new API, and they *insist* you use MVVM patterns
[21:46:14] <PJBoy> direct2d and cairo make that fairly simple
[21:46:16] <LordKalma> which I don't understand either
[21:46:21] <PJBoy> everything else eludes me
[21:46:26] <TheGuestMovie> that MAUI discussion missed 2 things: 1) devs usually use Linux. It's easier for them if they can compile/run their apps on their preferred OS, and only do platform-specific testing later on.Â Â  2) Until the very last comment before it was closed, no one mentioned the tons of "embedded" industrial/medical/car/etc Linux systems that show rich UIs.
[21:46:27] <TheGuestMovie> They only kept talking about desktops.
[21:46:28] <LordKalma> Qt... well... Qt sucks, but we all know that
[21:46:52] <ville> it's usable for variety of things
[21:46:52] <rpav> PJBoy: with nanovg it's pretty similar .. with skia there was stuff about like, implement your own bridge to the backend and that's about when i noped out
[21:47:10] <LordKalma> 1) devs usually use Linux. // Not MAUI-type devs. They use windows for Visual Studio, or Macs to allow them to simulate the iOS apps with the iPhone connected
[21:47:19] <LordKalma> this isn't the type of devs C++ devs are
[21:47:23] <rpav> not to mention again the ginormous size of the binary which basically dwarfed the rest of the project
[21:47:25] <LordKalma> this is people making Android apps
[21:47:28] <TheGuestMovie> LordKalma: Qt doesn't suck, YOU suck. And yeah, C# has a huge stdlib. That's what enterprise developers get to work with.
[21:47:40] <TheGuestMovie> Do in like 10 lines what a C++ dev spends a few weeks writing from scratch
[21:47:50] <TheGuestMovie> often by using unintelligible boost libraries
[21:48:04] <ville> that's hardly from scratch at that point
[21:48:04] <kalven> seems that most users don't care about app sizes
[21:48:35] <ville> kalven: instruction cache is a myth
[21:48:48] <PJBoy> I draw the line at electron
[21:48:58] <kalven> ville: does it matter a lot of guis?
[21:49:01] <TheGuestMovie> I'm at a threshold where I need to update all sorts of legacy embedded apps, and would've loved to use C#. But lack of Linux GUI means I'll probably just upgrade to Qt 5 / 6.2
[21:49:01] <PJBoy> each electron app uses a minimum of 1GB RAM
[21:49:10] <PJBoy> meaning I can only run up to 8 or 16 of them
[21:49:19] <rpav> eh they use a lot less from what i've seen
[21:49:21] <rpav> maybe not on windows?
[21:49:35] <rpav> neutralinojs still seems the best option for that kind of thing if you really want it though
[21:50:02] <LordKalma> Qt and I buck suck, TheGuestMovie
[21:50:06] <ville> kalven: whilst it's probably true that many kinds of gui programs do sit 99% of the time idle waiting for user input, somehow people still manage to fail writing them in responsive manner
[21:50:24] <kalven> ville: I doubt it has anything to do with the size of the binary though.

[21:59:03] <kalven> how big is skia these days?
[21:59:08] <LordKalma> that said, yeah, screw electron. Qt is mediocre, and C# libs... oh well
[21:59:34] <rpav> well, people/groups/etc tend build up personal/custom utility libs
[21:59:59] <rpav> but the committee definitely doesn't have very good priorities
[22:01:37] <LordKalma> as I keep saying. We still have talks about containers, while the others are talking about stakeholders, and applications
[22:01:48] <rpav> eh
[22:02:56] <rpav> i mean c++'s bread and butter is still fine control of data organization in memory, not just banging out buttons with different corners, damn the costs
[22:03:58] <rpav> not to say it can't be better in many respects, but when you're like "we really need to organize this so we can maximize throughput for large scale realtime data" you're always going to be talking about containers of some variety

[22:05:18] <kalven> ville: sure, but the output?
[22:05:42] <ville> kalven: didn't compile. killed the repo already
[22:07:23] <ville> oddly skia doesn't appear to be packaged for arch
[22:07:25] <kalven> damnit.. gotta do everything myself!
[22:07:38] <kalven> libskia.so, 62M here
[22:07:56] <rpav> skia isn't really something you package alone i think, mostly link into your app with your custom stuff .. or at least that's how it was awhile back?
[22:08:00] <ville> are the backends separate dso?
[22:08:51] <ville> no clue what it is or how it's visioned to be utilized. never had the need forit
[22:09:15] <TheGuestMovie> Disk space isn't an issue in this day and age I think. I wouldn't care if Electron apps were each 1GB, if they performed like native apps.

[22:45:04] <cq-work> That's no excuse. You can have web technology and not be a collossal piece of garbage.
[22:45:27] <rpav> LordKalma: no the whole UI is rendered to framebuffer regardless of your GL use (and you have to be careful if you are using GL and switch framebuffers)
[22:45:39] <rpav> _maybe_ there's still a software mode but i dunno i haven't really dug
[22:45:51] <LordKalma> But anyway, the Qt workflow on widgets is: if there are OpenGL widgets, they are rendered, then they are *copied* to CPU memory as QImage, the rest of the UI is rendered on the CPU, and then copy all of that back to the framebuffer
[22:46:57] <rpav> i'm not sure that's the case any more, but pretty horrific if so

[22:58:48] <LordKalma> https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qopenglwidget.html#relation-to-qglwidget
[22:58:49] <ville> does qt have gpu-based text rendering or is text why they end up rendering widgets on cpu?
[22:59:06] <rpav> orthogonal concern
[22:59:24] <rpav> you can render reasonably well using both at once
[23:00:01] <cbreak> seems there's https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qopenglwindow.html too now, which claims to be faster: "Unlike QOpenGLWidget, QOpenGLWindow has no dependency on the widgets module and offers better performance."

[23:05:00] <LordKalma> you can download the tgzs I think... The problem is a nice installer

[23:27:47] <rpav> LordKalma: a much lighter framework like vue.js .. you can go purely vanilla but really it's not the components that are the thing you'll want, it's the other tools like routing
[23:27:51] <rpav> you can roll it all yourself, but it kinda sucks
[23:28:17] <LordKalma> Vue has routing?
[23:28:30] <LordKalma> (and bootstrap and stuff? haha)

[23:32:14] <LordKalma> https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#introduction
[23:32:26] <LordKalma> like, React.js is JS with some HTML. Vue is clearly HTML with some JS
[23:32:41] <TheGuestMovie> writing UIs in web frameworks is degrading. Hacking HTML that was designed for text documents, into some monstrosity to try to have animations, touch interfaces, etc
[23:32:55] <rpav> shit i'm building something on here and everything is slow
[23:33:14] <TheGuestMovie> you don't write stuff that feels natural, you write stuff because it will render in a certain way. Like speaking in riddles.

[23:53:54] <LordKalma> yeah, that's the closest thing to data
[23:54:00] <LordKalma> and then there's like controlling the actual hardware
[23:54:03] <rpav> yeah probably where MVVM is still way too heavy
[23:54:06] <LordKalma> lots of buttons and stuff
[23:54:35] <LordKalma> In Qt I just have a class that controls the radio, and anther class that displays buttons for said class
[23:54:44] <LordKalma> wire up the things with signals/slots, bam done
[23:55:06] <rpav> in my view you basically have _the data_, which is some comprehended information (i.e. not bytes to parse, but an actual API you can get a sample or things at a high enough level they're useful), and a view which looks at it
[23:55:17] <LordKalma> but yeah, the QWidget has both the "view" and the "view behaviour" like, "grey out this field and this other is selected"
[23:55:23] <rpav> and controls which poke bits of the API
[23:55:52] <LordKalma> I have to reflect on this
[23:56:06] <LordKalma> after I finish this website crap.
[23:56:17] <LordKalma> which I lost two weeks of since you convinced me to try Vue haha
[23:56:34] <rpav> but like you wouldn't put some signal processing thing in the UI code (like is often convenient in Qt), but like have actual separate tools or methods in SignalVector or whatever for doing the things
[23:56:41] <rpav> D:
[23:56:41] <LordKalma> ah of course not
[23:56:50] <rpav> well if you have something going in react i mean it works too
[23:56:58] <LordKalma> https://github.com/ruilvo/radioamadorismo-website
[23:57:01] <LordKalma> you can look at it
[23:57:05] <LordKalma> even run it if you have docker
[23:57:07] <rpav> it's just a much physically larger toolset .. i think the sites it produces are still relatively compact?
[23:57:08] <LordKalma> it does nothing for now haha
[23:57:26] <LordKalma> yeah, the deployment size is actually decent
[23:58:32] <rpav> plus if you found useful tools in react (rendering?) then rewriting those if you had to would suck
[23:58:50] <rpav> man i wish there was some qt inspector thing
[23:59:01] <rpav> click on a live qt app and see where the hell something is coming from
[23:59:07] <LordKalma> there is!
[23:59:38] <LordKalma> https://www.kdab.com/development-resources/qt-tools/gammaray/
[23:59:47] <LordKalma> a bit of a PITA to setup the frst time
