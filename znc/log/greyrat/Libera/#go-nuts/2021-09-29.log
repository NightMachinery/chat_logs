[01:54:36] <fizzie> No, there's no `else` branch for a loop in Go. You'd probably have to DIY it with flags and/or gotos. (Though "text/template" pipelines have a {{range ...}}...{{else}}...{{end}} construct. I think you tend to get that sort of thing more with template engines.)
[01:55:55] <krux02> in nim there was a named break that I could use with named blocks.
[01:56:24] <krux02> go seems to have namebd breaks as well, but there is no named block, only named loop
[01:56:55] <seebs> i sort of hate "else" on a for/while/etc, it just doesn't seem to make any sense to me.
[01:57:16] <seebs> either it means the same thing as just putting that code after the for, or it means something weird and confusing.
[01:57:37] <krux02> seebs, it means something weired and confusing
[01:58:11] <krux02> no it is just a very long if {} else if {} else if {} else
[01:58:11] <fizzie> I know there's at least two different weird and confusing things it can mean, because IIRC Jinja templates and Python define the same thing differently.
[01:58:38] <krux02> but with the difference that all the conditions are processed in a loop rather than a static construct.
[01:59:21] <krux02> I don't know Jinja at all, and I only know python superficially.
[01:59:25] <krux02> never liked python.
[02:00:28] <fizzie> Python's `else` clause in a `for` loop executes when the loop terminates "normally" (by running out of things to iterate, or having the condition evaluate to false), but not when you `break` out of it.

[02:02:14] <fizzie> AFAIK, the intended use case is when you do a loop to search for something, you put the "didn't find it" logic in the else block, and use an early `break` if you do find it.

[02:13:05] <b0nn> I think, because I don't know if you can slixe a string like that - because it's not addressable, and even if it were you'd be looking at a slice of bytes

[02:20:01] <fizzie> zsnes: Yes, but that doesn't mean anything, because "assigning the source variable" changes what data it's pointing at.
[02:20:14] <krux02> zsnes, how can the conversion of string to []rune be free?
[02:20:22] <zsnes> so you're saying it made a copy at the time of a and s being reassigned?
[02:20:33] <krux02> you have to reallocate and parse the runes in the string
[02:20:53] <zsnes> krux02: its just a matter of reinterpreting the memory block in a different way
[02:21:01] <fizzie> No, it didn't make a copy at any time. The reassignment just made a/s to refer to a different string.

[02:21:40] <fizzie> zsnes: No, why should it? It's still referring to (a part of) the original string/slice.
[02:21:50] <krux02> string is utf8 and []rune is utf32

[02:23:45] <zsnes> ok so that is what i thought
[02:23:58] <zsnes> the assignment thing is somewhat confusing
[02:26:16] <b0nn> WRT the strings, I think it's clearest if we think in terms of addresses, even though they aren't entirely applicable - orig := 0x0001 - 0x0008; subslice := 0x0003 - 0x0006; when a new string is created for orig the pointer in orig moves, to, say 0x0010 - 0x0020; so the subslice still points at the original data, not a copy
[02:27:13] <zsnes> yeah, so basically giving the appearence of copying that section of the string
[02:27:19] <zsnes> because there is no way to modify that slice now
[02:28:37] <b0nn> Yeah - and getting the address of the slice would be the slice struct, not its contents (although you might be able to via unsafe.Pointer)

[02:34:28] <zsnes> thats exactly what happens if you do a for range over the string
[02:34:35] <zsnes> it converts the string to []rune()
[02:34:40] <zsnes> if it was making a copy everytime that'd be pretty silly
[02:35:25] <krux02> zsnes, it emulates as if you would iterato over []rune, but it never converts ever to an actual []rune
[02:35:47] <zsnes> emulates it?
[02:35:52] <zsnes> where does it say that in the spec
[02:36:01] *** Joins: foobaz212 (~foobaz212@cpc147290-walt27-2-0-cust197.13-2.cable.virginm.net)
[02:36:15] <b0nn> that's an implementation detail
[02:36:33] <zsnes> indeed
[02:36:39] <fizzie> Well, there's nothing inherently impossible in doing exactly that even if your source code has the tokens `[]rune(s)` in it. Especially if, say, the only way you use that []rune is in `for i, r := range []rune(s) { ... }`.
[02:36:51] <fizzie> (I don't know if it actually *does* that; my guess is probably not. But it could.)
[02:36:57] <zsnes> how are you emulating a rune array without converting it to runes? what?
[02:37:28] <b0nn> unless you store the string as []runes in the first place, and a read is a conversion
[02:37:33] <krux02> fizzie, if it would do that, my code would be devastated in performance
[02:38:04] <krux02> fizzie, and no it can't do that
[02:38:12] <fizzie> Well, obviously a sufficiently clever compiler to do that would only do it when it's advantageous.
[02:38:23] <fizzie> But you could *certainly* make it compile `for i, r := range []rune(s) { ... }` into a piece of code that doesn't allocate storage for all the runes at once.
[02:38:50] <fizzie> (Like I said, I don't think it does, it was more a comment about possibilities.)
[02:40:16] *** Quits: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[02:40:32] <zsnes> the spec for "range" says this: For a string value, the "range" clause iterates over the Unicode code points in the string starting at byte index 0.
[02:41:01] <fizzie> Yes. So in that specific case, where you don't do anything else with the []rune, it would only need to transform that to the equivalent of `i := 0; for _, r := range s { ...; i++ }`, to make the index handling match.

[02:42:07] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[02:42:16] <fizzie> I know. That's why I said what I just said as my previous comment.
[02:43:31] <fizzie> Or in terms of your example, there's no fundamental reason why it couldn't generate the same code for both of the things in https://play.golang.org/p/vRfF2xTYucD since they have the same observable behavior.
[02:46:24] <zsnes> so basically its only free in a for range loop but not if you just convert a string to bytes or vice versa..
[02:46:31] <zsnes> that's a wonderful caveat
[02:48:47] <fizzie> I mean, the range loop is just a special case that's *easy*, don't get too hung up on that. But in practical fact it would seem to generate a call to `runtime.stringtoslicerune` even in the simple case, so I'm not arguing you shouldn't just simplify it to "conversion from string to []rune is always a copy". Just that you shouldn't claim it somehow *must* be that as a law of physics.
[02:49:02] <krux02> is there an easy shortcut to get the last element of a slice?
[02:49:20] <krux02> like back() in std::vector?
[02:49:49] <fizzie> No, you have to type `slice[len(slice)-1]`.
[02:50:32] <krux02> myVeryLongObject.veryLongMember.myVeryVeryLongName[len(myVeryLongObject.veryLongMember.myVeryVeryLongName)-1] it is then?
[02:50:58] <bpalmer> go suggests not using long names.
[02:51:09] <fizzie> Or `s := myVeryLongObject.veryLongMember.myVeryVeryLongName; s[len(s)-1]`.
[02:51:50] <bpalmer> (or a very tiny helper function)
[02:52:07] <krux02> does go already have generics? If yes I could implement `back()` on my own
[02:52:12] <krux02> I constantly need it.
[02:53:54] <fizzie> It doesn't. There's been a suggestion that there'll likely eventually be a "slices" package akin to the existing "strings" (except dealing with generic []T rather than string) once generics land; it might be a function in there eventually.
[02:54:03] <zsnes> you _could_ do that with []interface{} and then use type assertions which would be messy and not worth it
[02:55:10] <zsnes> type GenericSlice []interface{} ... func (gs *GenericSlice) Back() interface{} { return gs[len(gs)-1] } <-- and then you need to type assert the result of back() every time
[02:55:17] <bpalmer> or reflect.ValueOf(s).Len()
[02:55:29] <zsnes> or you could do this for the one tpe of slice you are using, if its the same type of slice all the time
[02:55:56] <bpalmer> but , really, s[len(s)-1] seems like a much simpler approach.
[02:56:46] <bpalmer> without the overhead, without the design issues. If s is a long name, most text editors make it easy to deal with
[02:57:13] <zsnes> yeah i pretty much never use reflect, ever..unless its looking up struct tags
[02:57:39] <krux02> I am used to languages that have some form to access the end
[02:57:53] <fizzie> An `[]interface{}` is hardly ever useful for anything (except for an actual heterogenous list of arbitrary things, which itself is probably pretty uncommon), because you can't convert a `[]somethingElse` to it. Without actually making a separate []interface{}, that is.
[02:58:07] <krux02> c++ has s.back()  or *(end(s)-1)
[02:58:35] <krux02> nim has back indices s[^1]
[02:58:46] <krux02> python just allows negative numbers.
[02:59:48] <krux02> zsnes, reflect is pretty much for serialization.
[03:00:11] <fizzie> There was a failed proposal to allow negative *constants* for indexing operations as a very shallow syntactic-sugar level, if you're interested. https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33359
[03:00:27] <fizzie> (Also links to few of the earlier flavors of it.)
[03:01:29] <fizzie> Also discusses a few of the more creative special syntaxes for it, like `len` without an argument, or a special use for _.

[14:00:03] <fizzie> "Tags with paths" is a thing you can (indeed, must) do for multi-module repositories where you have a single repository that has multiple separate modules not at the root directory of the repository.
[14:00:33] <fizzie> https://golang.org/ref/mod#vcs-version "If a module is defined in a subdirectory within the repository, that is, the module subdirectory portion of the module path is not empty, then each tag name must be prefixed with the module subdirectory, followed by a slash. For example, the module golang.org/x/tools/gopls is defined in the gopls subdirectory of the repository with root path
[14:00:35] <fizzie> golang.org/x/tools. The version v0.4.0 of that module must have the tag named gopls/v0.4.0 in that repository."
[14:01:28] <fizzie> (Most modules fall into the case of the paragraph above that, where the go.mod file is directly in the repository root directory, and the version tags are then just "vX.Y.Z" with no prefix.)

[14:07:37] <twaapo> now I look at it, what does it mean like in the autorest case where there doesnt seem to be version on the root dir, only prefix/vX.Y.Z
[14:08:21] <twaapo> only then all the prefix/vX can be whatever, and not necessarily match?
[14:08:44] <fizzie> There's no go.mod in the root directory either, only in the autorest/ subdirectory. So that's consistent with what I pasted.

[14:08:55] <twaapo> hmm true
[14:09:19] <twaapo> so the other option would be to use separate repos for these modules, but they opted to serve it as one
[14:09:54] <twaapo> but then again its nested more
[14:10:29] <twaapo> so autorest/v0.11.21 contains autorest/adal/v0.9.15
[14:10:34] <twaapo> sounds very detached
[14:10:41] <fizzie> Well, no, it doesn't really "contain" it.
[14:10:46] <twaapo> :D
[14:10:53] <fizzie> The tag autorest/v0.11.21 is used for version 0.11.21 of the module defined by autorest/go.mod; the tag autorest/adal/v0.9.14 is used for version 0.9.14 of the module defined by autorest/adal/go.mod.
[14:11:09] <twaapo> how are they related?
[14:11:19] <fizzie> They're not. Other than just living in the same Git repository.
[14:11:26] <twaapo> hmm
[14:11:37] <fizzie> If you have a subdirectory with an independent go.mod in it, it's not part of the module defined by its parent directory.
[14:12:01] <twaapo> lets say we have a repo with 123980567 modules

[14:12:14] <twaapo> how likely a project uses all the versions at master head?
[14:12:17] <twaapo> like 0%?
[14:15:09] <fizzie> IIRC, nested modules like that aren't even handled specially by the thing that uses your local copy of the source for the main module. As in, if you check out a copy of the go-autorest repo, go into the autorest/ subdirectory, and do a `go build .`, it will look at the go.mod for the `require github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/adal v0.9.14` line, and fetch v0.9.14 of that module from GitHub
[14:15:11] <fizzie> (well, via the GOPROXY), instead of using your local checkout.
[14:16:34] <twaapo> so if i clone the repo, i get the most recent code at branch, but when i build it fetches the commits needed?
[14:17:52] <fizzie> Except for the module in which you invoke the go command (the "main module"), which will be whatever code you have, possibly with local modifications. At least that's how I remember it working.
[14:17:54] <twaapo> that would be kind of cool, but not very intuitive :p

[16:13:10] <Sam> krux02: if you can't remember the index, look up the "strings" package. It's easy enough to search through a string for a substring, which appears to be all you need? Maybe I'm misunderstanding: https://play.golang.org/p/JgoT5Am3TlK

[16:13:59] <fizzie> As in, there's supposed to be a difference between A := "foofoo"; B := A[0:3] and A := "foofoo"; B := A[3:6].
[16:14:07] <Sam> Yah, could be
[16:14:23] <Sam> More info needed to know the actual problem :)
[16:15:57] <Sam> If you're asking "can I get the original start index given to the slice" the answer is "no". Especially if you're slicing another slice, because you don't know how big the underlying array is so that index that you used might be a completely different index in the array, so it gets discarded and you can't get it back.
[16:16:15] <krux02> Sam, searching would make my linear algorithm an O(n^2) algorithm.
[16:16:31] <krux02> I found this, https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#StringHeader
[16:16:31] <Sam> Yes, it's a bad idea, but it appears to be what you're asking for if you don't know the index :)
[16:16:35] <krux02> how do I get this from a string?
[16:16:46] <fizzie> Didn't I post an example yesterday doing that?
[16:17:10] <krux02> Sam: it is also not correct in case the substring appears multiple times in A (which it does)
[16:17:13] <Sam> Fair warning: you will almost certainly write buggy broken code if you're going to insist on doing it by reflecting over the slice pointer
[16:17:19] <Sam> Yes, I know
[16:17:49] <krux02> I am doing a search through a string return the match as a string, and now I would like to contiue the search where I left of.
[16:18:06] <Sam> So keep a copy of the index where you left off around
[16:19:20] <fizzie> If you want to translate C++ pointers as directly as possible, and they all refer to the same underlying data, turn them into `int`s that are offsets within some (implied) string. Though quite possibly that's not the best way to go about it in terms of whatever the original problem was.
[16:21:25] <krux02> in C++ I made my own class, string with start and end, I thought in go it would be much more conveniont to use the language feature string which under the hood isn't anything else.
[16:22:23] <Sam> No, in Go you'd want to keep track of the star/end indexes or whatever too. String will not do that for you in the way you want (as I understand it anyways)

[16:23:21] <fizzie> Yes, but that's *under* the hood, not over the hood. You could hypothetically have a `type substring struct { data string; offset int }` type you pass around in your code, with an `func (ss substring) String() string` method when you need to pass the contents as a string to something.

[16:33:01] <krux02> that is why I was working with two pointers in C++, then you can move the boundaries independently of each other

[21:47:09] <siXy> If you have disabled checksum offload (why on earth would you do this?) then my next guess would be nagle. There's nothing inherent in http chunked encoding that changes how tcp works.

[21:50:16] <eric_hill> Honestly, I'm not sure what I'm looking for yet.  Trying to see if I can use the AWS Nitro Enclaves (pkcs11 provider in EC2 instance) to support a TLS certificate Go webserver.  They support nginx, I'm looking to go native.

[21:51:22] <eric_hill> The nitro enclave won't divulge the private key (seems reasonable) but I don't know how pkcs11 can support a TLS auth for a web server.  Does the web server hand the initial inbound socket through to pkcs11 for authentication, then get the handle back later?
[21:52:15] <siXy> I know absolutely zero about aws nitro but it sounds not unlike a software hsm.
[21:52:20] *** X-Scale` is now known as X-Scale
[21:52:41] <siXy> https://github.com/miekg/pkcs11 would be approximately what you'd want to do in that case
[21:54:44] <siXy> you would ideally modify it to implement crypto.Signer though, I think
[21:56:54] <eric_hill> I was just reading some of those test cases to look at capabilities.  At least I'm on the right track.  Tx.
[21:57:04] <siXy> eric_hill: Oooh. Found https://github.com/lstoll/awskms which implements crypto.Signer for AWS KMS
[21:57:18] <siXy> That's probably a lot closer to the right solution
[21:58:27] <siXy> Note: haven't checked that the code itself does sensible things, I'd want to go through it very carefully indeed before actually _using_ any of this stuff
[21:58:40] <eric_hill> That's with KMS, not Nitro, but I get the idea.  How would I plug a custom signer into the http listener?  ListenAndServeTLS needs the actual cert: https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ListenAndServeTLS
[21:59:57] <mertyildiran> siXy: I have an HTTP sniffer based on https://github.com/google/gopacket/blob/master/examples/reassemblydump/main.go and I rarely get HTTP methods like `tET`, `AAKkmDnmqOjQM8jkKH0MPOST` so I thought those are bit flips (soft errors).

[22:09:21] <siXy> mertyildiran: it's more likely that your sniffer is confused about what it's reading. bitflips are not super uncommon, but getting subtly wrong data from gopacket due to either nic offloading, various complexities of your OS networking stack, or simply code errors are far _more_ common.
[22:09:26] <lungaro> I dont want to write my own if I dont have to
[22:09:55] <siXy> mertyildiran: either way, tcp checksums are going to be the wrong place to look.

[22:11:56] <siXy> mertyildiran: Honestly, for an HTTP sniffer, gopacket is almost certainly the wrong tool - you'd be better off using more conventional means to get ahold of the http packets, and not try to implement so much of the underlying tcp complexity

[22:13:52] <mertyildiran> siXy: same code, same machine produces one corrupted HTTP request in a million of the same HTTP request. That's why I concluded that it's a bit flip.
[22:14:31] <bomb> dem cosmic rays
[22:14:33] <eric_hill> mertyildiran: Chrome developer tools, or wireshark.  If the HTTP method is a bit scrambled, that's either a bug or a pen-test tool.
[22:15:21] <siXy> I'd just parse pcaps out of tcpdump, personally.
[22:15:43] <siXy> Let it do the hard work of handling all this stuff
[22:16:57] <mertyildiran> siXy: the software that I'm working on is basically an open-source Wireshark clone for Kubernetes https://github.com/up9inc/mizu So like those are not some alternatives for me at least.
[22:16:58] <siXy> If the corrupted request still exists in the pcap, then yeah you have a real bitflip. 99 times out of 100 these are caused by faulty DIMMs, so a memtest86+ run or seven would hopefully confirm. Less common are CPU faults or external factors
[22:18:09] <siXy> er why won't tcpdump work? k8s still creates network interfaces that can be sniffed with tcpdump, far as I remember
[22:18:24] <mertyildiran> siXy: yeah, unfortunately the a pcap file was not recorded when those malformed requests happened.
[22:19:14] <mertyildiran> siXy: no, it works. It's just I'm unable to reproduce the malformed HTTP request since it's extremely rare.
[22:19:16] <siXy> I see. Well if it is a faulty DIMM/CPU then good news! You'll get more bitflips, so you can make sure you get a pcap for next time... :)
[22:20:40] <siXy> You could also just schedule a run of memtest86+ to look for the most common cause of bitflips. But I haven't used that tool before, and debugging what it might have done wrong with packet parsing is a big job
[22:21:31] <eric_hill> There's also cache memory on network controllers that could be going bad, or a bad handshake between the switch and the nic, or the router is having a bad day.  Bit flips happen.
[22:22:52] <mertyildiran> eric_hill: yeah, I was going to say that I guess there could be a faulty router or switch since it also happens in certain clusters.
[22:23:42] <mertyildiran> I understand that doing the TCP checksum in software is not a good option. Thanks a lot!
[22:24:12] <eric_hill> if you're capturing traffic at the switch level (monitor port for example), the checksums should be valid.
[22:25:09] <siXy> yeah, those can also happen. IME though the vast majority of bitflips have been faulty DIMMs
[22:25:32] <eric_hill> I also blame ethernet cables made by the lowest bidder.
