[16:39:02] <xx> can anyone tell me if adding additional terms to the GPLv3 license like this https://github.com/lawl/NoiseTorch/blob/master/LICENSE is a problem or can I safely ignore it and comply with it?
[16:40:16] <yrk> xx: that's is an additional term as per section 7 of GPLv3. it is explicitly permitted by the GPL (see section 7)
[16:40:42] <xx> perfect, thanks
[16:40:45] <yrk> xx: the right thing to do is to comply with it as if it was part of the GPL... because it is
[16:41:04] <DiffieHellman> xx, While most additional terms are not permitted, reasonable terms like just asking you to rename any changes are fine to accept
[16:41:33] <xx> 'reasonable' is poorly defined whenever licenses are involved
[16:41:40] <yrk> xx: not in this case
[16:42:01] *** Joins: iShareFreedom (~iShareFre@user/isharefreedom)
[16:42:02] <yrk> xx: section 7 of GPLv3 lists a select number of specific terms and says that any other terms are invalid
[16:42:27] <yrk> xx: so if the additional terms are not one of those in section 7, GPLv3 says that you may _remove_ them and distribute the work without them
[16:43:09] <yrk> xx: section 7: "All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term."
[16:43:33] <xx> thanks, this is exactly what I needed to know
[16:43:45] <yrk> xx: in this case, you came across an additional term that is explicitly listed in section 7(c), and therefore is permitted

[20:31:10] <jxself> Does that mean making entries for all of the drivers from Linux-libre?
[20:31:21] <jxself> Or where to draw the line?

[20:37:53] <craigt> jxself: That is a great question.
[20:38:27] <jxself> It's a challenge because there are a lot of them.
[20:38:31] <jxself> Some of them still work without the nonfree junk and others don't. It's hard to know in advance without actually having the hardware to test.
[20:39:20] <jxself> Otherwise, why give nouveau special treatment to be listed as its own thing?
[20:40:33] <David_Hedlund> jxself: Only packages.

[20:42:09] <jxself> "In 2010 nouveau was accepted in the 2.6.33 version of Linux kernel as an experimental driver"
[20:42:21] <David_Hedlund> +
[20:42:38] <craigt> Let's consider this example; I'm on h-node.org. I find my network adapter, and it lists "ath9k". Now what? 
[20:42:54] <jxself> We know that ath9k is fine.
[20:43:00] <jxself> But it can be hard to know that for everything.
[20:43:14] <craigt> Exactly. We do know this, but I am thinking of new comers.
[20:43:30] <jxself> Going back to earlier, some of the modules still work without their nonfree junk. Others don't. Still others may work in a degraded state.
[20:43:39] <jxself> It can also depend on the specific hardware revision.
[20:43:55] <jxself> I don't know that anyone's assembled a listing of all possible values for all hardware combinations.
[20:44:51] <David_Hedlund> I'm puzzled.
[20:45:05] <jxself> If the idea's to tell people "ath9k" is okay but radeon isn't for example well that's hardware because it does work. Sometimes. Depending.
[20:45:15] <jxself> er that's hard I meant.
[20:47:34] <David_Hedlund> Do you think ath9k (https://directory.fsf.org/wiki?search=ath9k&title=Special%3ASearch&go=Go) should redirect to https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Linux-libre ?

[20:49:08] <craigt> David_Hedlund: Thinking...
[20:49:20] <David_Hedlund> Or should it have its own entry where it can mention that it's part of Linux-libre?
[20:49:50] <jxself> I'm not sure if it even makes sense to enumerate all of the kernel drivers. There are a lot. And what would one say about their ability to work with only free software, unless someone can test it?
[20:51:29] <jxself> ...and can then report "yes it works", no it doesn't. Yes it does but in a degraded way (no graphics acceleration or whatever), no gigabit ethernet connection, whatever. Unless you use the older or newer hardware revision, in which case...
[20:52:01] <craigt> jxself: It also seems we would be duplicating work. I am thinking of <https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers>
[20:53:20] *** Quits: sbooch (~sbooch@user/sbooch) (Quit: leaving)
[20:53:57] <jxself> Maybe. But that has a different goal, I think. Just documenting what exists, not the usability without nonfree junk. And it's only for wireless.
[20:54:42] <jxself> It's a good goal to have and would be nice to have such a thing. I'm not trying to rain on that; just making sure that you know that such a thing would be a very large effort.

[20:57:33] <David_Hedlund> jxself: Do you think we should mention https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers in the Directory?
[20:59:42] <jxself> Probably not. The risk would be someone going there, seeing something listed and going with it when it needs nonfree junk to operate.
[20:59:58] <jxself> Because that list is not just the free software-compatible ones.
[21:00:08] <craigt> ^ agreed
[21:01:01] <craigt> If we go back to dragestil's suggestion, I think the goal is to connect the FSD and h-node in a useful way.
[21:01:34] <jxself>  Isn't the question of "does this hardware work with free software" what h-node was intended to solve?
[21:03:34] *** Joins: TheCreeper1 (~TheCreepe@user/thecreeper)
[21:04:00] <craigt> jxself: Yes. And from h-node, if a specific hardware works with a firmware listed in the FSD, it makes sense to have a link to the FSD from the h-node entry.

[21:23:37] <johns> craigt: you can imagine situations where someone reverse engineers / replaces proprietary firmware used by the upstream driver, but is considered too buggy by upstream to include
[21:23:54] <David_Hedlund> It's nothing that can be done by volunteers in this channel.

[22:17:59] <tricon> craigt: I did look through the Participate page. Though I don't have any concrete ideas by any means, if there were a way to view entries that are awaiting confirmation/approval and append a "worklog" of evidence for the validation of software as meeting the Requirements, I would think that could help speed up some reviews and discoveries. Of course, this potentially intros "more work" depending.
[22:19:51] <tricon> TLDR; I (perhaps others) would enjoy spending some free time auditing software for approval. If there's an approach through with auditors can prove themselves, perhaps that could put some on the track to become trusted admins for reviewing and approving software.
[22:23:52] <craigt> tricon: I agree and am taking notes.

[22:27:07] <adfeno> craigt, tricon: on that note of "worklog", some reviewers take notes on the talk page for a given entry.
[22:27:28] <tricon> adfeno: That's a good observation. I could start doing that.
[22:28:17] <adfeno> This is specifically important if the entry is related to a big/complex software or is about a software that might be controversal at some point.

[22:33:13] <GNUmer> Good evening. I found out that the original developers of Abitti (the Debian-based distribution used for every single matriculation exam) had correctly investigated license linking, used mostly GPl for their work and chose to use GPL-compatible software. The Finnish Matriculation examination board decided to use all of the Abitti code but decided to force every single test taker using their binary to accept restrictive Terms and 
[22:33:13] <GNUmer> Conditions, essentially making a software suite composed of mostly GPL-licensed software into a proprietary software suite.

[22:52:52] <jschwart> GNUmer: would be good to go over the 4 freedoms I think
[22:53:26] <seabass_> of course, it could be a custom contract which says that the GPL comes into force after a limited time - in that case, it still wouldn't be GPL until that period ended
[22:53:58] <jschwart> that's be like an escrow agreement
[22:54:04] <jschwart> that'd*
[22:54:45] <seabass_> jschwart, hmm, not heard that terminology in the context of contracts, but yes that sounds right
[22:55:07] <GNUmer> seabass_: That's what I was thinking about. There's a binary out there mainly composed of Debian software in which the Terms and Conditions deny the Four Essential Freedoms. I've heard the argument about it being acceptable due to some time limitation, but I don't think that's the case with GPL. I'll probably contact Debian and the FSF on that matter.
[22:55:21] <Neopolitan1> GNUmer: You could achieve this by originally licensing it under some other license and then re-licensing it under GPL later, so long as you own all the rights to do so.
[22:55:21] <Neopolitan1> Not that I'd recommend it
[22:55:47] <Neopolitan1> what GNUmer said. talk to debian and FSF, maybe also contact a lawyer

[22:58:34] <GNUmer> For the longest time I thought it was free software, but the licensing was only done on the developer's side.

I think it's a pretty shit move especially from an organ which is responsible of creating hundreds of new lawyers every year.
