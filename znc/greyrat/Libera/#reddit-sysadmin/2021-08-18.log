We have a helpdesk staff that among their duties is basic tasks on servers.

[05:04:27] <yuken> When you're building a house? Not very.
[05:04:34] <GIBBY> even the most rural shit places in hawaii that I lived for a few weeks had running water, sewer, and power
[05:04:47] <sd> 08<G​ene> if you're building a standard house and want 1 days of electricity... let me do the math.

[05:04:58] <sd> 08<G​ene> ~33kwh of energy storage...
[05:05:08] <yuken> So well under $5000.
[05:05:10] <sd> 08<G​ene> lifepo4 is more than $150 / kwh afaik
[05:05:22] <GIBBY> water was collected in massive tanks, treated there, and pumped into the house, power was delivered normally, and everywhere had a septic tank
[05:05:55] <sd> 08<G​ene> also, you gotta replace batteries every 5-7 years.
[05:05:56] <sd> 08<G​ene> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[05:08:44] <yuken> average highest temperature in Summer is 70F

[05:08:47] <GIBBY> catbeard: I'm.... actually watching it now

[05:10:42] <yuken> @Gene Most cooking would probably be gas, I'm avoiding electric driers & washers, and overall the highest energy use equipment would be a lathe & mill.

[05:41:14] <xe0n> wtf
[05:41:18] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> then it's not type I
[05:41:26] <JollyRgrs> iirc, there is a way to install the hyper-v role so that it basically runs hyper-v server and makes the host a guest
[05:41:28] <xe0n> wtf...i reboot an esx host and the vms on that host are going to go down.
[05:41:50] <jimender2> Do you have failover installed?
[05:41:52] <xe0n> unless they're vmotioned etc..
[05:41:55] <JollyRgrs> if you don't recall doing that... then you're basically running "virtual box" inside of windows (as far as for oyu to conceptualize this situation)
[05:42:13] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> yea
[05:42:21] <JollyRgrs> so unless your host is not actually a host and just a guest... yeah, it's going down like a led zepplin

[06:04:13] <CSWS> it never ends

[06:16:32] <xe0n> okay so for discussion sake - 1 x HDD covers all your backups right

[16:07:16] <sd> 02<H​unterkll> @fish yea we had that issue, and through our distros only one had HP stock, so we sucked it up and took it for those like ~5k machines
[16:07:31] <sd> 14<a​dhd_sysadmin> @Hunterkll So, E.g, my personal HDD could be switched from MBR to GPT?

[18:23:47] <PublicWiFi> if I won the lotto I'd prolly go part time lol

[18:24:07] <fritzwastaken> Management would complain about his numbers and he said ok, want me to leave?
[18:24:08] <estranger> 1.5 isn't that much to retire young on
[18:24:19] <fritzwastaken> it was 2004 and he was like 60
[18:24:24] <oxipital> i told the bitch i was busy. i have another job interview in like 10 minutes
[18:24:29] <estranger> ahh
[18:24:30] <fritzwastaken> I assume he was already doin ok
[18:24:52] <fritzwastaken> He would tell old stories all day to us when no customers were around
[18:24:57] <fritzwastaken> old audio systems etc
[18:25:09] <fritzwastaken> He was a badass dude to work with

[19:15:09] <PublicWiFi> ive been looking into @J​acobC this
[19:15:16] <PublicWiFi> steamlink was a good choice but I haven't looked in a while
[19:15:32] <PublicWiFi> my idea was to be able to play games on any screen in the house I wanted to
[19:15:37] <PublicWiFi> steamlink even did input over LAN too I think
[19:15:51] <Oliber> do you enjoy input lag?
[19:16:05] <Oliber> because that sounds like a great way to get input lag
[19:16:11] <PublicWiFi> if you  have 1bps links and its all ethernet you gucci
[19:16:15] <PublicWiFi> 1 gbps*
[19:16:38] <PublicWiFi> maybe you can't play twitch games like CoD or soemthing but for most anything else its fine
[19:16:46] <haise01> for casual gaming its fine
[19:16:55] <haise01> you could play strategy or horror stuff without issue
[19:17:08] <Jaelae> ordered something and needed to submit a selfie with photo id verification and my number. they respond back saying oh please include the country code in your phone number after 48 hours they say this. im like forget it nevermind
[19:17:54] <haise01> When I was registering on Hetzner cause I wanted to get VPS and try something, they wanted me ID card
[19:17:59] <haise01> instant nope from me
[19:18:18] <Jaelae>  yea i already went through the trouble of holding a piece of paper confirming things and holding my debit card. i mean jesus 
[19:18:25] <Jaelae> this was for a crypto purchase
[19:18:30] <Jaelae> so ok its a know your customer requirement
[19:18:54] <Jaelae> just annoys me that oh theres no country code in the matching phone number so thats not good enough? yikes

[19:31:56] <corn266> btw DomLS3 your regex was shit because s* means the character s 0 or more times
[19:32:18] <DomLS3> I didn't claim to be a regex master but that's why I said I thought it may have been $ instead
[19:32:28] <DomLS3> I thought $ meant delete anything after
[19:32:53] <corn266> might depend on which regex engine you're using, typical $ is EOL
[19:32:54] <DomLS3> but that didnt even return any result so shit bot is shit
[19:33:08] <DomLS3> so what should be used to delete everything afterwards?

[21:41:35] <oxipital> i dont think it *has* to run windows backup

[21:42:54] <int0x1C8> well, I've been given the task of coming up with something different because the backup is starting to take about 2 hours each night, during which time emails don't work
[21:43:07] <int0x1C8> does veeam do the same thing? 
[21:43:26] <oxipital> i think the preferred method is to enable circular logging
[21:43:32] <oxipital> don't backup logs
[21:44:30] <oxipital> and veeam does vm level backups

[21:45:18] <oxipital> yeah
[21:46:00] <int0x1C8> like I said the primary reason this backup is running is to keep it from running out of drive space and then all the services stop responding or start behaving weirdly

[21:50:50] <sd> 05<J​acobC> database or application logs?
[21:51:03] <mistiry> exhcange logs in this instance are not necessary application logs, but the transactional logs and are used to recover the database in a failure event
[21:51:11] <mistiry> you can enable circular logging
[21:51:14] <mistiry> which can help with this
[21:51:23] <mistiry> but you also may lose some recovery capabilities
