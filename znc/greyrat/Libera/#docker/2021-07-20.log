[00:11:32] <jrgilman> i'm hanging on this while trying to do a docker-compose build
[00:12:10] <artok> asked lutin now =)
[00:12:53] <artok> for docker-compose build thingies I usually skip, if it is pure docker build command, I might check =D
[00:12:54] <weedmic> jrgilman: can the docker ping the dns?  does the container contain a conflicting (already in use) set of IPs?  
[00:13:31] <jrgilman> weedmic: there's two issues, the first one I'm trying to solve is just during the build process
[00:14:00] <jrgilman> so do you want me throw in a ping command in the actual dockerfile and run docker-compose build?

[01:03:46] <chris_99> Hi, i'm wondering if anyone can see anything wrong here - https://gist.github.com/anfractuosity/41f50708629db9c3b8afb27e521b820b i'm running Firefox in a docker, but if i run Firefox outside of a docker first, then run Firefox from the docker , it  can then see all files like /home/chris/Desktop etc.
[01:04:09] <akik> chris_99: i just remembered something
[01:04:31] <akik> chris_99: try starting firefox in the container with --no-remote

[01:07:40] <chris_99> if i do that i get 'Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To use Firefox, you must first close the existing Firefox process, restart your device, or use a different profile.', so it stops you running the 2nd process in the docker
[01:08:46] <ash_worksi> I deleted all my images and started to rebuild one of them and ran into a `make /bin/sh: Operation not permitted` error. The command is `make: /bin/sh: Operation not permitted

[01:09:24] <ash_worksi> I deleted all my images and started to rebuild one of them and ran into a `make /bin/sh: Operation not permitted` error. The command is `docker-php-ext-install pdo_pgsql intl sockets` and nothing really comes before it other than a few `apk` commands
[01:09:59] <ash_worksi> (ie, I am not running this as some weird user)
[01:11:13] <ash_worksi> any idea as to why that might be happening?
[01:11:15] <akik> chris_99: kill the process in the container and start it again with --no-remote
[01:13:01] <ash_worksi> oop, my bad, it dies on `pecl install amqp`
[01:16:37] <akik> chris_99: oh right you're only starting firefox in there
[01:22:24] <chris_99> akik: are you not using --net=host, out of interest then? is there something i could use instead of that
[01:23:56] <akik> chris_99: no
[01:24:15] <akik> chris_99: i give users ssh access directly into the container
[01:24:48] <akik> chris_99: the container is in a docker user defined network and has a published port
[01:26:02] <chris_99> sorry i'm a bit confused, doesn't the FF in the container, need to access Xorg server on the host?
[01:27:45] <akik> chris_99: i have a remote xorg service in the container

[12:30:58] <tokko95> Hi, I would like to export some files "mid build" from the container to my local filesystem. As I understand currently the COPY command in dockerfile is only for copying files from local fs to container but not vise versa. So I would like to have a docker file that produces some files and an image. The build process is started by python script with
[12:30:59] <tokko95> "docker build" command. What would be the best way to get some specific files out of the build process in addition to the image?

[12:44:42] <tokko95> The end result of the build is a server image and build process is producing some files I would like to archive for later use and never include in the docker image as they contain sensitive information. I'm deleting them as a part of the build process, but I would like to export them before that. I'm open for other suggestions, if this is a bad
[12:44:42] <tokko95> idea or hard to achieve with a docker build.

[15:11:31] *** Parts: [twisti] (~twisti@toadwater.com) ()
[15:14:50] <BtbN> You don't usually do that. You install the latest image.
[15:15:05] <queeq> So basically rebuilding?
[15:15:15] <BtbN> What else would you do?
[15:15:29] <BtbN> apt upgrade in a running container would be lost next restart
[15:16:05] <queeq> Yes, my question is mostly how to automate this rebuilding, sorry for not being clear enough
[15:17:27] <queeq> If I use something like Watchtower, it would only cover base images, but my own images built on top of them would likely use cached stuff. Or am I wrong?
[15:19:28] *** Joins: tsujp (~tsujp@sourcehut/user/tsujp)
[15:20:35] <tsujp> If I have a container, let's say a hello-world HTTP server running with `docker run ... -p 0.0.0.0:8080:8080 ...` will docker bind to port 8080 on the host specifically? So it's okay for me to assume it will always RESPOND from 8080? I know it's listening, but this is crucially _responding_ also
[15:20:55] <BtbN> You usually don't automate that.
[15:21:08] <BtbN> You or your CI builds new images, you test them, and then deploy to prod
[15:21:14] <tsujp> Is that at me BtbN?
[15:21:21] <tsujp> Oh ok probably not given your second (for me) message
[15:21:52] <BtbN> tsujp, not sure what you mean by responding
[15:22:21] <BtbN> docker just fiddles with iptables and potentially its thin proxy to forward that port. It does not itself respond to queries.
[15:22:40] <queeq> BtbN, is there a way to replicate regular updates like it's done in a normal system (quite reasonable from security standpoint, isn't it?)?
[15:23:21] <BtbN> If you trust your CI environment enough to test new images, you can push straight to production from it
[15:23:24] <queeq> As I mentioned, I'm currently in a single host environment, so it doesn't make sense for me to deploy all the fancy CI/CD
[15:24:04] <BtbN> You won't get any kind of auto updates then
[15:24:19] <BtbN> And probably don't really need docker either anyway
[15:25:06] <queeq> I want apps to be isolated, Docker seems like the most lightweight solution to do that
[15:25:41] <queeq> Also I'm not planning to make changes to the images often. So I imagine if I rebuild them periodically in an automated manner, I could keep stuff inside the containers updated.
[15:26:12] <BtbN> isolated from what?
[15:26:23] <BtbN> If it's just a single user server, there's not all that much point to that.
[15:27:02] <queeq> From each other. So if one is compromised the attacker would have more difficulties getting access to the whole system.
[15:27:22] <queeq> Also comes with additional benefits like resource limitation
[15:27:24] <BtbN> Can have that with separate user accounts as well.
[15:27:56] <queeq> Docker does better isolation than that (think namespaces)
[15:28:06] <queeq> Also much less effort to maintain
[15:28:25] <BtbN> Well, seems like you're putting a lot of extra effort in already to keep it up to date.
[15:28:47] <BtbN> systemd services have pretty strong isolation from each other just as well
[15:29:34] <queeq> Yes, but it's one time, once it's done I wouldn't have to care anymore (unless there are incompatible changes, which I'm fine with; the main thing is that it is up to date).

[15:34:58] <BtbN> systemd can isolate services to the same degree as docker
[15:35:13] <BtbN> though most of them are not very useful in that state, unless specifically designed to run like that

[18:23:34] <ada_> rapid16: use a bind-mount or a docker volume
[18:24:37] <ada_> rapid16: the bind-mount style is useful if you have something at like, ~/project that you want to share into your container.  you could open your files in your editor from your home folder and your changes would be reflected immediately in the container.  a named volume would look the same, but the named volume gets instantiated under /var/lib/docker/volumes so it requires root to navigate into
[18:24:39] <ada_> there
[18:25:30] <rapid16> Where would i indicate the bind-mount? Dockerfile?
[18:26:24] <rapid16> Files I want to edit are under /etc, wouldn't that require root too?
[18:27:41] <ada_> rapid16: docker daemon already has root access, so it is able to bind anything you ask fr
[18:27:54] <ada_> rapid16: to set up the volume, you'd specify a --mount or --volume option during "docker run" or in your compose file
[18:27:58] <rapid16> Okay. I'll look up a bind-mount example

[20:18:18] <FreeBDSM> ada_: I can describe. I don't use compose. I have jenkins-agent running on a worker node. It has no root permissions, so I can't chown file outside docker container. I need it to run a docker container with ansible. Ansible needs ssh key to connect to another node and run stuff there. Ssh keys are treated like special files and need 400/600 permissions.

[22:26:35] <[twisti]> everything i find on google just leads me to docker desktop, which i understand to be 'windows docker', right ?
[22:27:08] <akik> [twisti]: you can install the normal deb packages in wsl 2
[22:27:37] <akik> or whatever distro you have there. i used ubuntu 20.04

[22:39:00] <programmerq> docker desktop is a little program that can fire up windows docker, linux docker in hyperv, and wsl linux docker. You can switch between which one you want.

[23:22:48] <masterasia> is there a difference between
[23:22:50] <masterasia> docker run -it --network dealroom_default --rm mysql -h db -u root -p
[23:23:08] <masterasia> and docker run -it --network dealroom_default --rm mysql mysql -h db -u root -p
[23:23:17] <masterasia> different output is given 
[23:27:14] <artok> first one, you give cmd (parameters to entrypoint) "-h db -u root -p" and second one "mysql -h -db -u root -p"
[23:27:43] <artok> depends how entrypoint handles 'em
[23:28:07] <masterasia> I thought --rm doesn't need a parameter
[23:28:16] <masterasia> why did I need to duplicate the 'mysql'
[23:28:50] <artok> all before first mysql is parameters to docker cli, then that mysql is image name, and after that comes CMD
[23:29:05] <artok> docker <docker-cli params> <image> <cmd>
[23:30:07] <masterasia> ah i get it
[23:30:14] <masterasia> the image name is ncessasry
