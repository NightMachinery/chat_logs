[02:28:56] <seninha> Hello, I spent all day working on my automata.scm script to include a procedure to convert a regular expression into a nondeterministic finite automaton: https://github.com/phillbush/automata.scm/blob/master/automata.scm#L74-L170
[02:30:14] <seninha> I still want to write a string->regexp procedure to convert "01|0*" to (make-union (make-cat #\0 #\1) (make-star #\0))
[02:30:52] <seninha> But I have no idea how to do that, I need some help here.
[02:31:33] <seninha> Here's an image of the execution of the example script: https://0x0.st/o8oP.png
[02:39:58] <jcowan> Google "Thompson algorithm"
[02:44:39] <seninha> jcowan: I'm using the Thompson algorithm to convert regexp->nfa. My problem is to convert string->regexp.
[02:45:03] <seninha> Like, convert "01|0*" to the list I commented previously.
[02:46:06] <jcowan> Ah.  I think the TE comes with a parser, though?
[02:48:12] <jcowan> Okay, everything is done at tinyurl.com/yellow-ballot-responses, a Google Sheet.  Everything passed except SRFI 5 (named let with rest args) and SRFI 156: (is a < 156) as equivalent to (< a 156)

[17:38:14] <jcowan> mdhughes: It's also a matter of what the compiler/intetpreter author(s) are willing to commit to.  In Lispworld the surface level parsing of code is stabilized by `read`, but deeper-level ASTs are not considered stable.  Documenting somehting that you treat as "subject to change at any time" can get you in trouble later.

[17:40:35] <jcowan> On the IBM 1130 (I think) certain officially meaningless instructions left various kinds of trash in the machine registers.  When the time came to write an emulator that would keep dusty-deck binaries running on newer architectures, the exact nature of that trash had to be preserved, disallowing certain speedups that would otherwise be possible, because programmers had come to depend on it.

[17:42:16] <sham1> And as far as that is concerned, "illegal ops" make for fun things esp. when they get relied on
[17:45:11] <jcowan> Per contra, on the PDP-8 you could combine certain instructions quasi microprogramming.  THe instruction "CLA IAC" would clear the A register and then increment it, e.g.  However, the exact behavior of the "rotate right" combined with "rotate left" could be used to tell which architectural generation you were on, until the last two generations finalloy stabilized it as "byte swap".
[17:45:41] <jcowan> There were more than 16 constants you could generate by appropriate combination in a single instruction.
[17:49:40] <ASau> I still don't understand why you're talking about "read", since it does not report the most important data that are needed when one wants that parser.

[18:44:05] <ASau> Introduce alternative string delimiters?

[21:17:13] <Zipheir> Mrtn[m]: Is there a matrix client that supports ed commands??  I have to say, message editing is never terser than when run on human brains https://xkcd.com/2337/
[21:19:33] <tokie> https://lololo.lol/🐶🦊 if someone ever asks me to write fizzbuzz in an interview i'm going to be really cocky about it
[21:20:44] <Franciman> wow tokie did you also implement unicode normalisation?
[21:22:26] <tokie> i'm just using rust's strings/char, which have good unicode support
[21:24:15] <tokie> i haven't implemented any string procedures yet, though. i did implement all of r7's char procedures
[21:24:53] <tokie> and i have implemented all of r7's string literal support except for the \x<hex>; escaping
