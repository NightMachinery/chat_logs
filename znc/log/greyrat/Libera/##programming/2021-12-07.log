[08:01:12] <OlJar> kinda surprising it made it until 2013 
[08:01:20] <OlJar> last box update was made in 2005
[08:01:45] <OlJar> server side was constantly getting updates though, in 2012 they finally got a junk mailbox

[08:05:18] <OlJar> i'd recommend http://webtvwiki.net for technical info, and also a guide for installing linux on the TV 2
[08:05:31] <ejjfunky> if you could install linux, it'll open up to much more options, i think.
[08:06:02] <OlJar> i'm not sure how great linux was on the TV 2
[08:06:20] <OlJar> i do know it's basically an OG xbox without a dedicated GPU and 128MB of ram
[08:06:48] <OlJar> obviously first gen is much less powerful, but it can vary between boxes
[08:07:24] <OlJar> all first gen boxes (except the ultimateTV) use a MIPS RISC x64 CPU, and range from 2MB to 16MB of ram
[08:07:48] <OlJar> also the webtv plus runs doom pretty damn well
[08:09:28] <OlJar> unfortunately hardware issues are starting to get to them
[08:09:38] <ejjfunky> it looks like an interesting project, just to try things out
[08:10:00] <OlJar> hard drives in plus boxes are dying and either ram or capacitors in the original classic boxes are dying
[08:10:35] <ejjfunky> dying as in failing with errors?
[08:10:47] <OlJar> yeah
[08:10:54] <OlJar> i've seen two die this way

[08:12:55] <ejjfunky> that's weird. irc is an old protocol. 
[08:13:14] <ejjfunky> i was thinking maybe because now javascript is way different than back then
[08:13:23] <ejjfunky> might be some kind incompatibility

[08:52:14] <smallville7123> is transpiler the correct term for a parser which extends the language?   for example, C/C++ has a macro pre-processor which extends the language
[08:52:39] <d3x0r> ya these days
[08:54:03] <smallville7123> eg "The C preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program before compilation."
[08:54:24] <smallville7123> can that be considered as a "transpiler" ?
[08:54:31] <d3x0r> yes macro processor is more apprpriate in that case - transpiler changes the structure of the code too

[08:57:47] <d3x0r> but it's not a transpiler it doesn't understand anything about types - it's just a token substition thing

[10:23:04] <flakland> actually i'd call it stalling more than bunrout
[10:23:16] <dodo> semantics
[10:23:25] <flakland> flameout
[10:23:33] <Jong> I thought there's a difference between needing a break for the rest of the day and what people call burn out
[10:23:54] <dodo> that probably depends on the person
[10:24:02] <dodo> and how long they kept going
[10:24:06] <EdFletcher> burnout isn't something you sleep off
[10:24:22] <flakland> writers block, haha
[10:24:24] <dodo> if you regularly slept it off you probably woudn't burn out anyway
[10:25:26] <EdFletcher> right, you wouldn't be getting burned out if you're able to sleep it off. burnout is prolonged malaise and lack of interest in the activity(ies) that previously kept you highly engaged.
[10:26:00] <dodo> i don't think lack of interest is required
[10:26:33] <EdFletcher> yeah true, malaise is enough. you can remain interested while still struggling to actually perform the tasks at hand. good point.

[12:11:16] <mrig> Ah ok.
[12:12:13] <mrig> The technique uesd in Caseys example for memory managements are surprisingly similar to how you might go about using memory sparingly in go, implementation permitting of course.
[12:12:58] <mrig> But dancing about the implementation is not really the go way, you are supposed to just code it and then look at perf afterwards.

[12:20:33] <mrig> This machine is a lenavo with a particularly problematic chipset, could be related to that I suppose.
[12:21:21] <mrig> Or so I gather, I'm no expert on any of that, just am aware that the kernel has had to be patched to support these chips
[12:21:51] <mrig> could be that it is the kernel version that is an issue too, no idea at all, could be anything.

[13:35:10] <mrig> to interface with, well one of the graphic servers.

[14:56:06] <nomagno> [itchyjunk]: Concurrent programming is where you do multiple things at once with some overlap. Again, Go is the master at embracing concurrency and coroutines as a core feature

[14:56:53] <lockywolf> concurrent programming is when you're programming two computers at the same time
[14:56:54] <[itchyjunk]> how can you do things concurrently?

[14:59:33] <bjs> [itchyjunk]: well maybe, maybe you have many cores on your CPU, and maybe your CPU has many threads that are switching between things

[15:53:25] <pyzozord> hmm, if you are able to switch tty, maybe during the freeze you can check what process is not responding in the other tty
[15:53:51] <pyzozord> but this might as well be a bug in one of the programs and not your fault at all
[15:53:52] <GeDaMo> Does Ctrl-Alt-F1 still switch to a text console?
[15:54:42] <mrig> When the system freezes yes it does, this is one way of unfreezing it. 
[15:55:08] <GeDaMo> Ctrl-Alt-F7 switches back to X, in case anyone doesn't know that :P
[15:55:39] <pyzozord> I'm not sure but I think switching ttys like that is actually in xorg, indicating that parts of the xorg are still functioning
[15:55:40] <mrig> Not sure if I needed to use the other tty though, I think I just logged out and back in again.
[15:56:12] <GeDaMo> I think you can switch virtual consoles before X starts
[15:56:18] <mrig> I have tried running on both x-org and weyland both are doing this, which is why I blame JS :D
[15:56:23] <pyzozord> actually come to think of it I don't know what gnome actually is
[15:57:01] <pyzozord> ah it has gnome-session, ok, so it is an actuall process that could freeze too
[15:57:28] <mrig> Could be yes.

[18:59:39] <Gamah> just pipe it to /dev/null
[18:59:41] <merijn> ah, wait, I guess it's n^2

[19:00:14] <pyzozord> that I am even dumber than I thought
[19:01:15] <merijn> I mean, it's 1000 entries, that's super tiny
[19:04:27] <merijn> O(n^2) for that is 1 million, that sounds like a lot until you realise, that 1 million int's is, like, 4 MB and in reality you only have 1000 you're accessing repeatedly, so everything will be in cache anyway
[19:05:34] <merijn> as long as you use a dense array it should be instant in basically any language

[19:32:21] <ThePhilgrim> Hi, for learning purposes I am looking to start working on my first full stack app. If I don't have a dedicated server, is there any way to simulate the full stack with frontend, backend & database locally?
[19:32:43] <Stefan26> that makes perfect sense merijn; i don't know the right term "smartness or ambition or knowledge"... but there is something to it; I feel like an imposter in many communities, but at work i feel like I'm a genius if i can do simple things :)
[19:32:49] <pyzozord> ThePhilgrim: yes, many ways
[19:33:06] <ThePhilgrim> pyzozord: Would you care to explain what the most common ways are?

[19:34:01] <pyzozord> ThePhilgrim: it's very dependent on the specific app you are making. In generall you can run everything that app needs locally, database, http server, etc
[19:34:16] <Stefan26> though im sure id feel like an imposter working in a team of bright people at say google
[19:34:33] <nosystemd> How to create update-rc.d to create the symlinks?
[19:34:56] <ThePhilgrim> pyzozord: Okay, so the database during development would be a folder with data files (json or similar) basically?
[19:35:01] <GeDaMo> I'm not sure what "PHP's local server" is but if you run something which opens a network port, you can connect to it from the same machine
[19:35:04] <pyzozord> ThePhilgrim: more complex solutions go in depth of layers of virtualization, you can put all the stuff in a virtual machine, you can control the virtual machine through vargrant, you can control vagrant through puphet or chef.
[19:35:34] <ThePhilgrim> GeDaMo: it's just a http server that you can run locally
[19:35:46] <GeDaMo> Then yes, that's what I'm talking about :P
[19:35:46] <merijn> ThePhilgrim: FWIW, you can get a cloud machine for ~5 dollars per month
[19:35:48] <pyzozord> ThePhilgrim: or alternatively ou can use docker for your virtualization, and then you can control dockers via docker-compose, then you control docker-compose in local kubernetes

[23:09:52] <vdamewood> pyzozord, that's a perfect explanation.
[23:10:20] <vdamewood> pyzozord: Also, it's an Apple thing. If you send a text message on an Apple device, it will use the iMessage protocol and the message will be blue. If you use SMS the message is green.
[23:10:43] <pyzozord> if you liked that, let me tell you how I understand present continuous :D
[23:11:01] <vdamewood> So, a change in color means a change in device on the sender, and people usually don't switch device families.

[23:54:14] <GeDaMo> "Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp."

[23:58:04] <pyzozord> so lisp is the canonical highly "dynamic" language, right?
[23:58:29] <pyzozord> I think common lisp is not strongly typed at all, is there a version of lisp that's strongly typed?
