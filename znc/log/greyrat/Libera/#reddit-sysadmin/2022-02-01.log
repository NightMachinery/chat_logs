[00:05:37] <signofzeta> I mean, last I checked, (General) Motors Liquidation Company is still a thing
[00:07:15] <monr0e> tbh, for myself, the point is that as of now, wall street has too much power to decide the future of a company, based solely on how a handful of investment managers feel about it. Investment in that format should not be the crux of a company's existence (although yes, it should play a significant role). Betting on a company to fail, at a rate beyond that company's legitimate possible recovery avenue, is basically market manipulation. It 
[00:07:15] <monr0e> opens an avenue for competitors to play unfairly, even if that comes close to or defies regulation. Proper short limitation, proper short liability, thats a big part of the objective. Then there's the whole individual customer problem, which was demonstrated when platforms started artificially halting sales of $GME - even though there were plenty of shares still on the market. It's all a rather big mess, so people put their hands in 
[00:07:16] <monr0e> their pockets, dug deep, and protested with hard cash. That's how I see it, at any rate

[03:09:00] <enix> ...
[03:09:04] <xe0n> i dont blame her, hindi names are hard
[03:09:05] <enix> well I mean.. yeah.
[03:09:13] <xe0n> i just call em dude or mate
[03:09:13] <slinky-ros> and websites hosted in flask are kind of okay because it's only 15 lines of script
[03:09:18] <slinky-ros> "hey champ"
[03:09:23] <slinky-ros> "cobber"
[03:09:35] <slinky-ros> "good question, cheesenuts"
[03:09:42] <xe0n> i work with a bunch of em, in the end they're just mate
[03:09:45] <enix> xe0n, I don't blame her either. She struggled with a name similar to "Sean" (she said seen instead of shaun basically), so like, it's gucci fam.
[03:09:54] <enix> But blaming dyslexia, I wonder if it's even real lol

[03:10:30] <Kiernian> I have mild dyslexia. I don't blame it for shit, but I do get aggravated at it here and there.
[03:10:30] <enix> oh i know
[03:10:41] <slinky-ros> but I believe it's when you rush through a sentence, not when you sit there trying to work out how to pronounce a word you've read a few times?
[03:10:59] <enix> I just question if she's saying it to avoid hate or if she's genuine

[03:11:46] <enix> That's interesting
[03:11:53] <slinky-ros> yeah but if I was to ask you to pronounce Carknobforkpoint
[03:11:54] <enix> when you're typing or as you're reading
[03:12:03] <slinky-ros> do you sit there and never get it right, or do you stop and re read the word
[03:12:13] <Kiernian> re-read, every time
[03:12:27] <slinky-ros> yeah, and you'd get the word correct eventually?
[03:12:52] <Kiernian> yeah, I'd definitely get it. and when I'm reading, but occasionally while typing if I'm transposing. MAC addresses are a bitch.
[03:13:12] <slinky-ros> makes sense to how I'd assume the brain would 'twitch'...
[03:13:29] <slinky-ros> enix, your mate just doesn't like people with international names :D
[03:13:48] <slinky-ros> xe0n's right, they should be "mate", "chief", "big fella" or "cheesenuts"
[03:13:57] <slinky-ros> depending on the familiarity
[03:13:59] <Kiernian> oh, and sometimes words group weird. Fritz Wasstakken is how it's pronounced in my head every time I see it, even though I know it's "was taken"
[03:14:59] <enix> kiernian yeah I feel like we all do that though
[03:15:01] <Kiernian> that's just my brain trying to make sense of words mushed together. your earlier one, for a second there, reminded me of mark knopfler with knobfork for a second
[03:15:07] <enix> slinky-ros, that's my presumption lol
[03:15:19] <enix> I like to try learn how to say their names properly though. Respects respect i guess.
[03:15:32] <slinky-ros> Kiernian, yeah, it's fill-blankchars(data as string) which doesn't have data sanitisation in your noggin'
[03:15:37] <Kiernian> yeah, difference is, I don't know what's "brain normal" and what's the part of my brain that's not like most other people's, heh
[03:15:48] <slinky-ros> sometimes it gets a data overflow on words with complex formation
[03:16:15] <enix> Kiernian if everyone looks weird, you're the weird one ;)
[03:16:47] <Kiernian> yeah, that's truth :)

[06:12:31] <cryptic1> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, SJDVD. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE system made useful by the SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[06:12:31] <cryptic1> Many computer users run a modified version of the SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE system, developed by the SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it
[06:12:32] <cryptic1>  is just a part of the system they use.
[06:12:34] <cryptic1> Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the Log Forge operating system: the whole system is basically SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE with Linux added, or SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE/Linux
[06:12:39] <cryptic1> . All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of SPACE JAM DEE VEE DEE/Linux

[08:02:47] <xe0n> just deploy it from the ts and call it a day
[08:04:04] <sideup66> basically in this systems case, we want to get win 10 on the box, but supposedly cannot use the usb ports on the system nor a disk, in my case what im doing is deploying my usual mdt setup to a vm, then sysprepping that, then cloning it to the drive so he can toss it in his system...its a backwards way, but whatever

[08:30:25] <xe0n> this is hack bullshit 101.
[08:31:00] <xe0n> sysprep does not strip drivers, ...its why people use sysprep to generalize an image for deployment across the sames machines, it sucks. ts ftw.

[08:36:08] <sideup66> got it, will note for future, i thought it with the /generalize flag strips drivers and such, at least thats what my googling was telling me

[08:40:35] <JollyRgrs> that SID duplication will kick your butt later on if you allow devices with same SID on your network

[09:03:20] <xe0n> eeek
[09:04:13] <Cl0udNinja> sounds like the meeting ended early then eh
[09:04:20] <JollyRgrs> "what's that noise?" "is xe0n dying?" "can someone check on him?" "xe0n i think you're on mute"
[09:06:29] <slinky-ros> he can switch to mic and speakers from pc in a pinch :D
[09:06:43] <epony> not on that PC
[09:06:47] <xe0n> i just left lol
[09:06:53] <xe0n> the meeting was pretty much over, just yapping crap

[09:07:20] <jay-ros> hmm, why can I not change my nick to 5pm-ros

[09:08:10] <DollyParton> that works
[09:08:28] *** DollyParton is now known as jay-ros
[09:11:30] <SirSceptalot> numbers in front just don't seem to work
[09:11:39] <jay-ros> oh really
[09:11:47] <jay-ros> something I've never tried I suppose
[09:12:03] <jay-ros> seriously, property market in sydney is so weird
[09:12:19] <jay-ros> there's, like, an apartment in the cbd two streets from the water for 800
[09:16:19] <jay-ros> ...and it's almost the same price as where I live for a similar apartment
[09:16:21] <misspwn> that seems cheap
[09:17:30] <jay-ros> it is and it isn't I suppose... there's more premium places which go skywards in price
[09:17:46] <jay-ros> but the fact it exists is irritating
[09:18:24] <misspwn> should probably rephrase that one. that seems cheap considering the state of an apartment i'd see less than say $700
[09:22:21] <jay-ros> yeah it's just such a weird mix at the moment
[09:22:53] <jay-ros> people are WFH, and people are not WFH, and the surrounding suburbs have huge price tags, and inner-city living is lower because there's less people from overseas
[09:23:58] <misspwn> so that is apparently a common trend i'm seeing as well. former coworker actually sold his home twice what it estimates for and will rent a few years
[09:24:25] <misspwn> even with the jacked up prices on apartments it was still cheaper than to keep a mortgate or to buy a home right now
[09:24:50] *** Quits: Work-BWMerlin (~Work-BWMe@user/bwmerlin) (Quit: Client closed)
[09:25:06] <misspwn> but apartments are really hard to find and people staying holed up in them
[09:26:11] <Kiernian> that's per week, right?

[09:26:32] <jay-ros> :D my brain is melted right now, it's hot here
[09:26:37] <jay-ros> 800,000
[09:26:41] <sd> 12<c​ooleb09> I pay 1200 a mo on the beach in WA
[09:26:53] <jay-ros> rent is about the same, it's dropped HEAPS because of wfh
[09:26:53] <Kiernian> ahhh, that's more like it, LOL
[09:27:01] <xe0n> im dripping sweat lol
[09:27:05] <xe0n> and im about to go pickup my car
[09:27:08] <jay-ros> but like 5km outside of the cbd it's increased dramatically
[09:27:11] <xe0n> rip
[09:27:19] <jay-ros> good luck, bring powerade
[09:27:35] <jay-ros> our tenant loves us and they've not hit us up for a price increase so we've been good
[09:27:41] <jay-ros> sorry landlord
[09:28:19] <jay-ros> it's like 84F in my office
[09:28:26] <Kiernian> although 1200AUD/850USD wouldn't get you anything but subsidized housing in minneapolis. NOthing below 1400AUD for a single bedroom here, and it's typically more like 1700 AUD for a crappy one bedroom that's at least not infested 
[09:28:44] <misspwn> oh jeez jay-ros i thought you meant $800 a month
[09:28:46] <misspwn> lmaooooooooooo
[09:28:52] <jay-ros> per month?!
[09:29:07] <misspwn> sorry the concept of buying apartments is just so bizarre to me
[09:29:28] <misspwn> yeah i couldn't afford that hahahha
[09:29:30] <enix> everyone at work: it's so hot today
[09:29:33] <Kiernian> yeah, apartment rent skyrocketed after the housing crash in 2009 and hasn't come back down
[09:29:33] <enix> me: winter weather
[09:29:45] <enix> also me: house a cool 20 degrees thanks to an aircon and a series of fans
[09:29:48] <xe0n> its only going to get hotter lol
[09:29:56] <xe0n> wait till mid feb

[09:30:01] *** Quits: riff-IRC (~riff-IRC@user/riff-irc) (Remote host closed the connection)
[09:30:06] <Kiernian> in fact, it's only gone up, and now lots of places require your paystubs as proof that the rent will be no more than x% of your total pay
[09:30:59] <Kiernian> if the rent is more than 40% of your income, lots of places won't let you sign the lease

[09:31:43] <enix> Kiernian, property doesn't convert well between aud and usd because it's generally a factor of the average wages in an area
[09:32:03] <enix> and wage doesn't convert easily either; I might earn 80k AUD in Australia or 80k USD in America for the same job
[09:32:19] <enix> but 80k usd goes a lot further than 80k aud
[09:32:31] <Kiernian> how's that?
[09:32:37] <Kiernian> oh. right, gas is way cheaper, etc
[09:32:49] <enix> no goods and services as based on the converted price
[09:32:55] <enix> so you buy a tesla for what? 30-40k?
[09:33:00] <enix> It's like 70k+ here

[09:40:10] <Hunterkll> 80k USD and you're fuckin' living high
[09:40:21] <Hunterkll> well, at least, better than a majority of the country anyway
[09:40:36] <enix> but 80k for l3 not unreasonable, probably a little low right?
[09:40:53] <Hunterkll> 70k is reasonable for sr sysadmin
[09:40:57] <Hunterkll> but then again, it also depends on where you are
[09:41:16] <Hunterkll> we got jr sysadmins making like 40k and shit
[09:41:17] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:41:31] <Hunterkll> but they also livin in placs where the rent be like $400/mo
[09:41:36] <enix> hmm these days we're probably making a little more, but it doesn't scale
[09:41:52] <enix> You'll likely see pays rise with your inflation, if you're lucky 
[09:42:38] <Hunterkll> oh i always get an annual pay raise
[09:42:43] <Hunterkll> tho last year was only 2.1% 
[09:42:44] <Hunterkll> lol
[09:44:43] <enix> that's like an adjustment for the inflation rate of yesteryear

[09:46:29] <enix> sounds boring af
[09:46:32] <jay-ros> that caps at ~12,500 per month after tax
[09:46:35] <enix> but seems our pricing might be a little up?
[09:46:54] <jay-ros> ohp, sorry, 8870 per month

[09:48:22] <enix> oh, I disabled hex and super
[09:48:26] <jay-ros> hahaha
[09:48:34] <enix> That's like 2.2k/week then, which still isn't phenomenal
[09:48:43] <enix> it's like 50k/year in tax :|

[16:42:40] <Cl0udNinja> I moved places and changed numbers after that
[16:42:47] <Activ8> nah that didn't happen an fbi wouldn't visit you for withholding code it would be a court case and letters

[17:18:49] <Alternity> well 'azure' is not the/a solution its just another platform
[17:18:49] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> but the guys heads nearly asploded when I setup Azure Devops and said "code goes here now"
[17:18:59] <Alternity> you can still do clickops, go and spin up a bunch of fat VM's manually :D
[17:19:22] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> i hate the term clickops
[17:19:29] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> they should call it what it really is: failure
[17:19:32] <Alternity> why, its funny
[17:19:45] <Alternity> oof, to be fairy bascially every thing i do
[17:19:53] <Alternity> i do once manually first to go through the full process before i automate it
[17:21:06] <rainfios> how do you guys do windows stuff in a devops manner if you rarely have to create new VMs
[17:21:13] <Alternity> right now i'm writing a shell script to automate the graceful shutdown of outdated deployment pods to prevent early job shutdown. most of the work was me copy and pasting commands into the shell to validate before i write up the yaml manifest
[17:21:27] <rainfios> like I feel it doesn't make sense unless your at a place where you have cattle and not pets

[17:21:49] <rainfios> i automate my tasks lol
[17:21:55] <rainfios> i guess thats technically devops then
[17:22:00] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> the usual low hanging fruit are user add/drop/edit
[17:22:03] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> BUT
[17:22:08] <Alternity> 🤷it depends on the company as well
[17:22:09] <rainfios> i always thought devops was like ci/cd ansible terraform etc
[17:22:15] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> take those tools, get htem into version control, get them tested, etc.
[17:22:23] <Alternity> rainfios devops is a philosphy, SRE is the implementation
[17:22:32] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> and document hte hell out of it so it's not just rainfios doing it, but so anyone can come in and be the monkey that pushes the button
[17:22:38] <Alternity> devop is the religion, SRE"s are the high priests
[17:22:46] <rainfios> good to know
[17:22:50] <Alternity> read the phonex project
[17:23:02] <Alternity> prob best book for intro into the overall philopshy
[17:23:09] <Alternity> and relatively readable 
[17:23:39] <Alternity> also most devops stuff you hear is related to software companies making SaaS software
[17:23:50] <Alternity> so its not going to be 1:1 at every company
[17:23:55] <rainfios> ill check it out
[17:23:57] <rainfios> ty
[17:24:06] <Alternity> sure thing, lmk if you have other questions
[17:24:16] <Alternity> i moved from traditional windoze IT to devops stuff a couple years ago
[17:24:28] <rainfios> yea im thinking of making that move too
[17:24:32] <rainfios> def need to learn more linux stuff
[17:24:38] <Alternity> i recommend it, the money is very very good
[17:24:44] <Alternity> but you need to learn a ton and keep learning
[17:24:53] <Alternity> yea you really need to know linux
[17:25:02] <rainfios> how does the transition usually work? do you find a sysadmin job that also does some cloud stuff, then transition to a full devops job after?
[17:25:14] <Alternity> good guess, exactly
[17:25:26] <Alternity> i was a sr sysadmin at a company doing windows stuff, and then we expanded to azure
[17:25:41] <Alternity> so i got some exp with infrastructure as code and cloud, and used that to get a cloud engineer job, and now i'm a sr SRE
[17:26:16] <Alternity> also tripled my salary in the last 2 yaers which doesn't hurt :D
[17:26:27] <rainfios> interesting. yeah I'm def gonna start applying to new jobs, since my current one has a seperate linux and aws team so i get 0 opportunity to play around w/ that stuff
[17:26:33] <sd> 06<o​nenerdyguy> I still do find that the "Devops for Windows" tooling and throught process is still pretty bad
[17:26:45] <Alternity> rainfios you got a github.com?
[17:26:48] <rainfios> nope
[17:26:51] <rainfios> yes actually
[17:26:53] <JollyRgrs> git gud, son
[17:26:59] <Alternity> get on it, start using it
[17:27:02] <rainfios> i setup it up for some ps scripts while back and got lazy on it
[17:27:09] <Alternity> thats a good start, now learn python
[17:27:35] <Alternity> and docker, and linux cli for bash scripting and kubernetes and terraform and what terms like idempotent and immutable mean :D
[17:27:42] <rainfios> yeah i can def pick up python, I guess my concern is more learning all this stuff and not actually using it at my job and forgetting it lol
[17:27:48] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> fuck shell scripting
[17:27:51] <Alternity> and what all the different services in aws and azure are :D
[17:28:05] <Cl0udNinja> thats what google is for
[17:28:15] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> and gcp
[17:28:16] <Alternity> agreed, but how they map to real world services
[17:28:21] <Alternity> is generally a mapping you build in your head
[17:28:27] <Cl0udNinja> true
[17:28:28] <Alternity> and all the little idosyncrocies
[17:28:36] <Alternity> also all the error messages you get that have zero google results
[17:28:44] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> and then learn why you can't use them the way you want
[17:28:45] <Alternity> i remember that being a shock, realizing i couldn't rely on google anymore
[17:28:57] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Like Azure FrontDoor STILL doesn't support web sockets
[17:29:09] <Cl0udNinja> Alternity, I rarely find that unless its a niche work specific problem
[17:29:17] <Cl0udNinja> if I do, its because I did bad wording
[17:29:27] <Alternity>  its less common now that i'm on AWS for job
[17:29:38] <Alternity> but when i was on azure i frequently found bugs in their service implementations
[17:29:41] <rainfios> for my next role that I'm waiting a offer for, it's gonna be a pure cloud infra
[17:29:47] <rainfios> all their windows infra is on aws 
[17:29:49] <Alternity> awesome
[17:30:04] <rainfios> so I'm thinking that'll probably at least give me real world cloud experience, although it aint exactly the same
[17:30:05] <Alternity> get 6 months to a year in cloud and you can bounce somewhere else
[17:30:08] <Alternity> that is pure linxu or k8s or w/e
[17:30:15] <Alternity> thats awesome exp!
[17:30:20] <Alternity> you can easily spin that whatever way

[17:30:56] <rainfios> i feel the future is hybrid
[17:31:01] <Alternity> on prem windows IT stuff is getting either outsourced or automated or reduced 
[17:31:16] <Alternity> if you work in trad IT you are a cost center, IE company sees you as an expense
[17:31:25] <rainfios> yea, honestly my current place probably wont outsource cause of financial regulations
[17:31:39] <Alternity> where as devops generally assists with something that makes the company money. so you're a revenue instead of a cost center. one of many reasons devoops gets paid extremely well

[17:40:13] <monr0e> Dot Net with DotVVM. Needs a bit of fiddle but I plan to get it running natively on apache and move to MySQL or MariaDB. All on-prem, although I will probably have to invest in cloud services at first until there's funding for equipment
[17:40:39] <monr0e> I was goig to go nginx, but I think mono is better supported in apache, as far as I can tell
[17:41:00] <monr0e> I shot myself in the foot learning C#, since these days I kinda want to avoid MS
[17:41:02] <lanceheadv2> @onenerdyguy depends on whether I use --append or --insert right? Doesn't --insert always make it #1 by default if no # is specified? 
[17:41:13] <Alternity> neat, good luck wiht the SaaS. all sounds pretty reasonable.
[17:41:33] <Alternity> now that you can run dotnetcore on linux no reason not to use C#, heard its a good language

[17:42:19] <Alternity> i would 10)% not use dot net these days
[17:42:43] <monr0e> Yeah dotnetcore still lacks a few things. It's nice and I might move to it in a few years, but I want to see some more maturity first
[17:42:46] <Alternity> i dont think you can get normal dotnet running on apache?

[17:42:57] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> yes?!
[17:43:17] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> wait it depends on the version
[17:43:32] <monr0e> Oh you can, within the mono framework. There's still the lack of support for some features, but since this is dotVVM which runs inside web forms it shouldn't be too complex
[17:43:33] <Alternity> oh yea didnt they rename core to normal dotnet

[17:45:21] <PublicWifi> but thats just for usernames i think
[17:45:41] <misspwn> i don't believe they have to create a password. the way that i understand it was if someone clicked a training phishing email something would go to their manager and they would have two complete a phishing training 
[17:45:47] <Alternity> monr0e or avoid it and just do json in mongo or something :D

[17:53:37] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies live on a liquid diet! Yes, thats correct. Flies tend to live off a diet based on liquids. Why? Well, that’s just how they are built. See, they lack the mouthparts needed to chew food, so instead, they have to drink it.

[18:05:48] <A_Dragon> `  transfer: 1.33 GiB received, 408.17 MiB sent`
[18:05:51] <PublicWifi> 2FA with GVC is a big mess compared to native implmentation on SSLVPN

[21:25:25] <fritzwastaken> IME. It gets the benefits of the software's innovation and optimization that came from the way you programmed it. As a programmer who writes BSD-licensed software, you are LITERALLY dedicating however many years of your life simply to program software for proprietary corporate/government projects to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically.

[23:50:39] <PublicWifi> a lot of work for like 2 pieces of meat lol
[23:50:56] <signofzeta> depends on the size of the bone-in wing.
