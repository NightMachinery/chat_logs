[06:26:47] <Common-Lisp> I've never seen any reason to use elgot over lsp
[06:26:47] <technomancy> it wasn't very good, probably because people who do a lot of C++ tend to not know much about elisp

[06:27:03] <technomancy> probably because people who tend to know a lot about elisp tend to be good at avoiding C++?
[06:27:31] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Common-Lisp: From the sound of it eglot is less opinionated and intergrates nicer with builtins.
[06:27:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They also went through the paperwork to assign the project for elpa.
[06:27:51] <bremner> Let's pretend opinionated software is a good thing
[06:27:59] <Common-Lisp> Aurora_v_kosmose, that sounds great on paper, but I've never had an actual problem with lsp that eglot claims to solve

[06:28:33] <aidalgol> eglot has improved a lot, and I find it saner than lsp.el these days.
[06:28:39] <Common-Lisp> from my perspective eglot's only raison d'etre is that they aren't lsp, which is a really bad raison d'etre.

[06:29:04] <aidalgol> Like, its code is an order of magnitude easier to follow.
[06:29:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Better integration with built ins & lower friction with builtins means it can be a lot less annoying to make it play nice with other packages.
[06:29:34] <Common-Lisp> Do others have issues with LSP not working well with other packages?
[06:29:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Common-Lisp: It uses its own APIs & stuff instead of plugging into built-ins, so yes.
[06:30:00] <bremner> I'm lucky enough not to need LSP or eglot

[08:27:03] <Spiker01> Hello everyone! Which plugin is responsible for displaying menus with auto-completion? I installed company, eldoc, ivy+counsel, go-mode. Instead of a menu with completion, I get a "highlighted" text after the cursor. I think I should set some kind of "variable" involved in ivy to get the popup menu to show up.
[08:27:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Completion pop-up is usually company.
[08:28:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Both company and ivy+counsel require some configuration to be enabled everywhere.
[08:28:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Said configuration may be found on the project's readme pages.

[08:51:57] <v3ga> quick question... just getting my feet with with elisp. when using use-package is it redundant wrapping forms with progn as I attempted here? https://gist.github.com/cyberoctopi/40ac5f288c51a3e005d6e15c99680983
[08:53:52] <Aurora_v_kosmose> v3ga: I think so yes.
[08:54:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Several of the examples on its github page have multiple unwrapped forms.
[09:01:29] <v3ga> Aurora_v_kosmose: yeah i've gone forever without using and copy/pasting my configurations together with minor changes.  The sad this is I write clojure, why am I not taking full advantage and getting intimate with elish

[10:53:23] <amolith> I'm having a hell of a time getting mu4e working as expected and I'm not sure how to go about debugging it. Of the two issues, the first and most painful is that it keeps asking me for credentials when I try to send emails. I would prefer mu4e just hand the email off to msmtp and not handle any server communication whatsoever.

[11:23:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Normally read-envelope-from should do it, but I think it might conflict with the use of "from" in the config itself.
[11:23:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amolith: Ah, that's good. So that pushes the problem back to how mu4e is calling it.
[11:24:35] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amolith: I would suggest instrumenting message-send-mail-with-sendmail with edebug and seeing exactly how it calls msmtp.

[13:53:49] <bpalmer> s-liao: I'm not sure precisely what you're looking for; escaping is inherently context sensitive because you have to know what you're escaping for.
[13:53:49] <s-liao> I mean that not manually add \ on escape character.
[13:55:01] <pjb> s-liao: there are several such functions, depending on the kind of escaping you want. eg. (shell-quote-argument "1.223 \"str\" \"complex \\\\ string, indeed\\\"\" 2.23 nil ") --> "1.223\\ \\\"str\\\"\\ \\\"complex\\ \\\\\\\\\\ string\\,\\ indeed\\\\\\\"\\\"\\ 2.23\\ nil\\ "

[14:08:48] <ShinyRice> fruit flies are dirty as hell, no way!
[14:08:59] <pjb> s-liao: why do you have to turn it into a string? when reading a line, you should get a string already!
[14:09:16] <dcunit3d> codingquark: it was an unintentional unit vector reference
[14:10:24] <pjb> s-liao: why don't you use a csv parser to read csv record directly into lists?  Note that a csv record can span several lines!
[14:10:49] <pjb> s-liao: you're talking about input port, but this is not an emacs lisp or common lisp notion. What lisp are you using?
[14:11:57] <pjb> s-liao: there are several lisp libraries to parse csv. eg. https://github.com/mrc/el-csv or https://melpa.org/#/parse-csv

[23:07:35] <sam-> Hi, I think I'm misunderstanding how autoload works. I have this: https://github.com/brotzeit/rustic/blob/master/rustic-doc.el , where rustic-doc-mode is autoladed. Before running rustic-doc-mode, no other functions in the file are available, as expected. After running rustic-doc-mode, the functions are visible in M-x but they often behave strangely and give me unexpected issues. I can solve the issues by manually opening the file and
[23:07:35] <sam-> evaluating the buffer, but this is clearly unergonomic. Isn't this what emacs is doing after I run the autoload command?
