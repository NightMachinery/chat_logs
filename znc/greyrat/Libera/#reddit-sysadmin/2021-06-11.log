[00:08:12] <oxipital> ethics are morals in pratice
[00:08:23] <nobyk> although whatsapp left the whole terms of use thing apparantly

[02:27:59] <oxipital> its de3vops and shit
[02:28:10] <Cl0udNinja> the project is an HA cluster file sync setup, so when a file changes on the active node, the passive node(s) pick it up and do stuff with it
[02:28:22] <Cl0udNinja> I built it using generic `git` and ssh keys... 
[02:28:51] <oxipital> so basically a cron job that runs git?
[02:28:55] <Cl0udNinja> no
[02:29:28] <oxipital> what triggers the sync?
[02:29:28] <Cl0udNinja> uses inotify to watch files and trigger an action, which copies them into git and then notifies the rest of the cluster to pull the commit
[02:29:29] <Church> An event driven cron job that uses git

[02:31:48] <Cl0udNinja> J4Y its actually a pretty good solution. client (passive node) hears the commit does a checkout, and then copies the file and runs pre/post copy actions
[02:32:11] <Cl0udNinja> even has step-through processes, so if a node is more than 1 commit behind it rolls through each commit executing the appropriate actions

[03:32:15] <haljhon> I listened to a pretty good podcast about charity management... it contrasted a charity that was running by threads and had almost no money to one that had a lot of money and was making a big impact.
[03:32:23] <Patrick> we had 4 or 5 mobile warming trailers they brought into the neighborhood after we'd been without power for over 36 hours
[03:32:26] <haljhon> The question it posed was which one had the greatest output.

[03:33:09] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> texas somewhere I assume
[03:33:14] <haljhon> the podcast was assessing the charitable output of the organization... the number of people impacted and people reached based on their cause.
[03:33:15] <Patrick> Houston
[03:33:17] <sd_> 10<G​orian> it basically says that you need to compare the size of the pies, instead of the portions of the pie
[03:33:26] <sd_> 04<J​4Y> The achievements of a larger charity helping people keep a humane standard of living can't be diminished
[03:33:55] <haljhon> nah, these were charities helping people with drug abuse (one instance) and alcohol abuse (the other).
[03:34:01] <sd_> 04<J​4Y> eh
[03:34:12] <sd_> 10<G​orian> E.G. if you have a "pie" or a charity that makes $100/year, and 90%, or $90 of that goes to their cause, that's *less* good done, than a charity that makes $100,000 a year, and 30% of their money, or $30,000 a year, goes to the cause
[03:34:29] <haljhon> I guess I took away from it that the charity that had more money was doing a better job managing their resources and therefore they had a larger, growing program and were more stable so they could exist longer and continue to operate.
[03:34:30] <sd_> 04<J​4Y> With the amount I'm paying on alcohol and tobacco tax, the government should be helping people with their addictions
[03:34:30] <sd_> 10<G​orian> so the amount of "overhead" is less important than the total good that that charity does
[03:34:47] <haljhon> Versus the one where the guying was literally about to go broke personally and wasn't sure he had another year left to operate.
[03:35:03] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> that's true to a degree
[03:35:05] <Patrick> I'd go along with that right up until the point where a CEO of a charity is making one of the top 10 salaries of CEOs

A company that makes $200,000 a year and gives 12% of it to their cause, that's $24,000 to their cause - by all other metrics, $24,000 to your cause is *better* than $9,000
[03:42:24] <Patrick> I get your point, and kinda agree. That said, come on now
[03:42:29] <Patrick> 0.7%?
[03:42:40] <Patrick> 99.93% of the money you take in goes to overhead?
[03:42:42] <Patrick> I mean, come on
[03:42:47] <Patrick> 99.3%*
[03:43:12] <sd_> 10<G​orian> well, it depends on WHY. For instance, if they are investing in company growth so they can give more in the future, i'd say that's fine
[03:43:33] <sd_> 04<J​4Y> Or if they're paying for all the expenses that go into 'protecting police'
[03:43:35] <sd_> 10<G​orian> if they are consistently paying a few execs 90% with NO signs of growth or improving, then sure that's messed up
[03:43:40] <sd_> 04<J​4Y> ^
[03:44:41] <sd_> 10<G​orian> the point of paying CEOs high salaries is this idea that it's an investment - you expect that putting money into a good CEO will improve and grow the company so you'll make more money and be able to do more - whether that's give more to your cause as a charity or make more money for your shareholders as a corporation
[03:44:44] <Patrick> Yea see I look at this from a strictly tax perspective. These charities take in all this money under the happy good feelings that their contributors offer, and somehow it all goes poof - which all our taxes subsidize
[03:44:55] <sd_> 10<G​orian> if you are dropping that money for no gain, it's a bad thing for either of them
[03:45:26] <sd_> 10<G​orian> actually, that's one reason I don't donate to all the charity drives Safeway, McDonalds, etc. does
[03:45:55] <Patrick> I'd much rather see the entire 501c3 law killed, and replaced with a tax credit system
[03:45:58] <sd_> 10<G​orian> what, they take extra money from me, aggregate it with all the other money collected from everyone else that they shamed them into, donate all those other people's money, and then take the tax breaks for their donations?
[03:46:13] <sd_> 10<G​orian> I could have donated that directly, and taken the tax benefits from doing so
[03:46:28] <Patrick> what you spent on directly impacting is removed from your books, and maybe you get an additional credit per dollar
[03:46:40] <Patrick> the rest of your overhead is taxed normally
[03:47:02] <sd_> 10<G​orian> curious how calculate that though
[03:47:15] <Patrick> didn't say I had perfect ideas :P
[03:47:25] <sd_> 10<G​orian> haha, yes - that's a fair point
[03:47:45] <Patrick> but he way the law is structured now is providing asshats who run "churches" more than one private plane
[03:47:50] <Patrick> and that's FUCKED
[03:48:02] <sd_> 10<G​orian> I do feel that too - you can identify that a system is flawed or imperfect, without having every answer to fix it and do it better
[03:49:20] <Patrick> I get a CEO is a CEO, and they command what they command, but like again, you should just feel bad if you run a 501c3 that can't manage to do better than 1% lol
[03:49:43] <Patrick> even if that 1% is a gagillion dollars
[03:49:47] <sd_> 10<G​orian> in general, I'd agree with you there
[03:50:35] <sd_> 10<G​orian> but hating a non-profit because they have a 40% overhead instead of 2%, or being angry that they decided to pay money for someone to run the non-profit full time is dumb

[03:51:29] <Patrick> it just feels dirty seeing commercials/ads pulling on heart strings, and then finding out 90% of your donation went to running the charity - not the poor starving elephant on the expensive times square marquee
[03:51:45] <Patrick> feels exploittive
[03:51:49] <sd_> 10<G​orian> I ran a sysadmin team for a non-profit for a long time. We decided that we needed better direction than we were getting from a volunteer president and volunteer board where everyone just gave time after work or something. We hired a president FULL TIME and the org got better . But a lot of people got angry and left and made a scene about how they won't work with us anymore

Interestingly, we don't have a visceral reaction to the notion that people would make a lot of money not helping other people. You know, you want to make 50 millio

[04:01:40] <Patrick> so I guess no jet for you
[04:02:19] <sd_> 10<G​orian> so... it's okay for a for-profit company to own a private jet because it saves them (and their shareholders) money

[04:05:24] <sd_> 10<G​orian> they do it because they get something out of it - good PR because the very popular non-profit that helps children talks about how x company did something for them, or they get a big tax write-off

[04:06:13] <sd_> 10<G​orian> and guess what - you need to MARKET and ADVERTISE in order to get well-known enough that it's worth it for a company to give you free shit in exchange for the good PR

[04:06:26] <Patrick> thinking about it, I guess I really don't have a problem with charities, my gripe is with churches
[04:06:30] <Patrick> can we just take away their status
[04:06:38] <Patrick> then Susan can keep her jet
[04:06:39] <sd_> 11<t​elgareith> can we just take them away?

[04:08:24] <sd_> 10<G​orian> well, it depends. Does the church exist to help others, or just as a service to the members?

[10:56:52] <zyk> tehe
[10:57:13] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> But I believe Linux should be used the RHEL way: wayland, dbus, systemd, GNOME and polkit.
[10:58:56] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> The argument of the Unix philosophy really gets me on nerves cause folks don’t consider the fact that that concept was made around 80s when hardware was limited in terms of disk space and memory. Nowadays it’s not a big deal if Systemd takes a few more MB of ram than openRC.
[11:00:23] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> The only valid complaint imho is the binary log one. That’s ok, I get it, it’s fair. Other than that, it’s just memeing.
[11:00:28] <Hobadee> giraffe, systemd taking more space isn't the issue.  Systemd doing *fucking everything* is the problem.  The "do one thing and do it well" philosophy is still very useful today.  I wish a few things would change with that (like, do one thing but still integrate - dubs helps with that) but otherwise it's still a good concept
[11:00:51] <csws> yeah found out the other day that systemd is used as a resolver on some systems

[11:01:44] <zyk> "if he likes you he takes over all your functions"
[11:01:54] <csws> I do find it preferable to shitty scripts
[11:02:01] <csws> but all the other shit.. jesus christ
[11:02:15] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> But on the other I find things like nspawn or systemd-homed very useful.
[11:02:31] <Hobadee> csws, absolutely.  The idea of having a watchdog ensure your daemons are running at all times and centralizing logging for them is genius.  Everything else is stupid.
[11:03:37] <csws> tho tbh
[11:03:38] <Hobadee> I honestly don't mind a binary format for logging either, as long as it's an *open* format that

[11:31:28] <Hobadee> Then you can fix some things... Home probably doesn't need to be >1gb on a server
[11:31:50] * gibby farts gibbyfarts.com
[11:32:17] <Hobadee> Honestly, you can probably start with 1gb for each, then increase as needed for various functions
[11:32:31] <Hempux> Hobadee: Ok they'll still need a new remote IP and stuff so theres some manual things, and if the customer changes IPs in their networks theyd have to make changes in the VPN. i can see how this solution is good in some scenarios.. Still for me its annoying because it means extra work :p
[11:32:43] <sd_> 11<g​iraffe> it's so f'n annoying that i have to specify a size
[11:32:56] <Hobadee> Hempux, Get on board with SD-WAN already.  :-P
[11:33:02] <a1> you said all of your servers are different sizes... are they physical?
[11:33:42] <gibby> they meant different RUs
[11:33:59] <Hobadee> giraffe, you should probably consider something like Ansible also... Depending on your use-case it's easier and safer than Bash scripts
[11:34:48] <Hempux> Hobadee: This is some kind of IoT simcards where the puropose of the VPN is for the IoT network to get outside access through the customers network. Thats why 0.0.0.0/0 on my side is a neccesity as well, 0.0.0.0/0 on remote is the annoying part

[18:54:43] <sintax> ^^
[18:54:45] <sintax> ever. 
[18:54:57] <sintax> Fridays are catch up days for the small stuff that's out there. 
[18:55:00] <fritzwastaken> I am actually quite happy I am as low in my org as I am
[18:55:12] <fritzwastaken> My boss and hosting team are spending the entire weekend migrating datacenters
[18:55:16] <fritzwastaken> and I know 100% its going to fail
[18:55:24] <fritzwastaken> But I am not working on that project at all
[18:55:28] <sintax> ha
[18:55:33] <sintax> you should show up with popcorn and watch. 
[18:55:47] <fritzwastaken> if I could "fly on the wall" their calls I so would
[18:55:55] <fritzwastaken> sitting there with a beer on discord laughing my ass off at them
[18:56:10] <sintax> for sure. 
[18:56:10] <fritzwastaken> just broadcasting the whole thing
[18:56:17] <sintax> migrating a dc i would assume is not a simple task
[18:56:19] <fritzwastaken> Neither team trusts each other
[18:56:25] <dewwii_> fritzwastaken: oh don't i wish. so many things are done on Fridays here.
[18:56:36] <fritzwastaken> and everything has to be 110% functional monday morning at 7am
[18:56:40] <fritzwastaken> or clients will be raging

[18:58:18] <sintax> you just want to watch the world burn fritzwastaken 
[18:58:30] <fritzwastaken> I just want to collect a paycheck
[18:58:34] <fritzwastaken> and keep my weekends in tact
[18:59:07] <sintax> nothing wrong with that.
[19:00:00] <sintax> I need to figure out something for my kid and i to do this weekend. 
[19:00:56] <fritzwastaken> dnd

[19:06:17] <sintax> learn to code! change your life!
[19:06:31] <sintax> maybe swimming. 
[19:06:42] <sintax> or hiking/fishing. wonder if i could get a cabin and and glamp this weekend. 
[19:07:01] <oxipital> whats glamping anyway?
[19:07:27] <oxipital> ive only seen it used like this week
[19:07:28] <sintax> oxipital: it's camping but you have all the amenities. 
[19:07:39] <sintax> like a/c, electric, stove, bed etc...
[19:07:47] <sintax> you're not just in a tent in a sleeping bag on the ground.

[19:08:14] <sintax> RootBear75: last place I worked we used a wiki page.

[19:08:37] <sd_> 04<R​ootbear75> the problem is the spin-up time for wikis are a PITA

[19:09:12] <sd_> 04<R​ootbear75> The problem is it's never done properly
[19:09:43] <sintax> I don't have any experience with anything else really. 
[19:10:14] <oxipital> we used confluence, i'm not sure what you mean by spin up time, but like i said theres import tools available

[19:12:26] <sd_> 04<R​ootbear75> so any that existed is out of date and useless

[19:13:50] <sd_> 04<R​ootbear75> and honestly if we're going to use confluence, we'd just use onenote pages and sharepoint

[23:11:53] <sintax> they just called, so i just put a ticket in...yes i see. they're starting monday. Me: OK, you realize I don't have any equipment ready to go right? Them: Oh it's ok. They'll have this old phone and computer we found. Me: ok!
[23:11:57] <sintax> have a great weekend!
[23:12:08] <sintax> lol haljhon 
[23:12:09] <haljhon> so I went and lived out by their headquarters. I had no badge, no computer, and no access to anything even if I did have one
[23:12:20] <sintax> lol but did you get to the know the team?
[23:12:34] <haljhon> I did... I had to wait on one of them to show up to the office every morning to let me in
[23:12:48] <haljhon> I was required by contract to work 8am to 5pm... but they didn't get to the office until at least 9:30 or so
[23:12:48] <sintax> that's annoying.

[23:13:11] <haljhon> so... I had to sit in the lobby and use my _other_ work laptop (for my real employer) and just... like... look busy
[23:13:45] <haljhon> I gathered that the majority of the team worked a schedule of like 10am to 4pm...
[23:13:51] <sd_> 06<o​nenerdyguy> that'd be nice
[23:14:27] <haljhon> yeah... they'd be like, "Oh, I'll get back online when I get home." and then you'd never hear from them again until the next day.

[23:49:56] <sintax> If it breaks in a year though you get a new one
[23:50:01] <sintax> equal or better.

[23:50:10] <sintax> PSU GPU and CPU i buy warranty's on
[23:50:13] <sd_> 04<R​ootbear75> I mean that's default with the limited warranty
[23:50:36] <oxipital> if they find its defective yeah
[23:50:43] <sintax> With the chip shortages and whatever other natural disasters come our way, might need it
[23:50:53] <oxipital> but companies have been known to argue
