[00:35:16] <warnes[m]> Ok, so they system is then half-duplex, since it won't be able to RX and TX at the same time.  
[00:35:43] <tnt> well yeah, wifi is half duplex.
[00:36:00] <warnes[m]> Ok, thanks.  
[00:36:26] <warnes[m]> Any suggestions on where to find an appropriate GPIO-controlled switch?
[00:45:26] <jholtom> minicircuits?
[00:45:27] <jholtom> pasternack?
[00:45:55] <jholtom> https://www.minicircuits.com/pdfs/ZFSWA2-63DR+.pdf
[00:46:03] <jholtom> something like this would probably be close enough for you
[00:46:41] <jholtom> warnes[m]: but also on the bladerf, doesn't it already have one built in, and can mux tx/rx on a single port?
[00:46:44] <jholtom> just do it in software?
[00:47:21] <warnes[m]> The bladeRF provides 2 RX and 2 TX ports, so I assumed that it didn't.
[00:47:42] <warnes[m]> * The bladeRF 2 micro provides 2
[00:54:26] <patchvonbraun[m]> The USRP B2xx uses the same RFFE chip, and it can handle half-duplex into a single antenna on the TX/RX port.     The RX will still "see" the TX because there's insufficient isolation to prevent that.  But you can just cope with it--it's "just a matter of programming".
[00:55:33] <funkylab[m]> patchvonbraun:  I think the B2xx has an RF switch on board to enable the RX/TX port
[00:55:59] <muaddib[m]> warnes: are you using gr-ieee80211 or the wiphy FPGA image?
[00:56:06] <funkylab[m]> yep, U811, U805, 
[00:56:18] <funkylab[m]> SKY13335-381LF switches

[01:24:42] <muaddib[m]> but after succeeding, you'll tap into the plethora of wifi amplifiers on the market?
[01:25:12] <muaddib[m]> single port wifi amplifiers
[01:35:22] *** Joins: yesno (~yesno@109.98.151.62)
[01:40:52] <patchvonbraun[m]> In many places, using it with an amplifier could get you in trouble, since devices operating in those bands require type-acceptance.  So using an amplifier to "boost" a setup that isn't type-accepted could theoretically land you in trouble.
[01:42:41] <Jacob[m]12> seems pretty unlikely that a bladerf running wiphy is type-accepted without an amplifier
[01:43:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> Jacob: Indeed.  But having an amplifier means you're more likely to raise unwanted attention...
[01:46:30] <muaddib[m]> Itâ€™s ironic that youâ€™re the only one Iâ€™ve talk to on here whoâ€™s had an encounter with the FCC (or Canadian equivalent) since youâ€™re primary area of research is extremely high gain listening!
[01:48:02] <patchvonbraun[m]> Both the FCC and IC (Industry Canada) have the notion of an "experimental license", for allowing you to legally "muck about" in bands and services that ordinarily would require type acceptance.
[01:49:55] <patchvonbraun[m]> Essentially ALL radio/wireless services require that equipment be type-accepted in order to be marketted, even if the end-users don't require a license.   The only exception is the Amateur Radio service, which fully expects that you'll be building your own "stuff".
[01:50:56] <muaddib[m]> For sure.
[01:54:02] <patchvonbraun[m]> Which is why I always urge caution when users are heading in the direction away from "lab equipment" to "setup and system I'm going to use for real".
[01:55:58] <muaddib[m]> Yeah, itâ€™s the responsible thing to do.

[02:13:56] <muaddib[m]> Sounds like  you got the B team
[02:14:24] <muaddib[m]> That sucks though.
[02:15:35] <patchvonbraun[m]> Despite the fact that I'm a long-haired hippy freak, my moral compass reliably points me in the direction of doing no evil.
[02:17:47] <patchvonbraun[m]> Well, OK, not *always*.  I worked for a DRM company for several years.   A move I regret with every fiber of my being.  One of our guys actually quit and went back to work on missile guidance systems because there was a strong "rules of engagement" framework around missiles, and on-balance, he felt he was doing the right thing.
[02:32:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> Vastly less moral ambiguity in what i do with my time these days, thankfully.
[02:33:31] <drmpeg> I don't think you killed too many people with your DRM code.
[02:34:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> drmpeg: Lives may well have been ruined, nonetheless.  
[02:36:07] <patchvonbraun[m]> Some of the nauseating watermarking stuff i worked on allowed linkage back to things like credit-card numbers, etc.
[02:36:51] <drmpeg> Zoinks.
[02:37:49] <patchvonbraun[m]> The entire DRM industry is morally-bankrupt as far as I'm concerned.  Along multiple axes. Can't believe it's still a "thing".
[02:39:52] <patchvonbraun[m]> Ironically, my son is now working for a financial software company that he describes as "exceedingly sketchy".  But likely won't be "stuck" there for very long.
[02:42:01] <drmpeg> In the 80's, I was the project engineer on the rebuild of the NORAD missile warning ground network. When the 1st Gulf War broke out, we found out that our system was sending missile warning to the Patriot batteries. I could not have been more proud. Later it was found that the Patriot never really made an intercept, so it's always a grey area.
[02:44:13] <drmpeg> After that I pivoted into video compression.
[02:44:23] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yeah, I remember the PATRIOTS, after the fact, weren't actually very effective.  But, you know, neither were SCUDs, so, it all worked out.
[02:46:10] <drmpeg> I wonder if I've done some harm with video compression. Think of the huge number of servers storing cat videos and ruining the environment.
[02:47:30] <patchvonbraun[m]> drmpeg: Well sure, but think of how many disk drives would need to be manufactured if you hadn't :)
[02:51:24] <drmpeg> I know that Phil Karn KA9Q has some reservations about his role in creating the Internet.
[02:52:45] <patchvonbraun[m]> drmpeg: I was comiserating with him on that subject just a couple of weeks ago.   None of us early Internet folks predicted what it would become.  We were starry-eyed, bushy-tailed, and utter idealists.
[02:53:58] <patchvonbraun[m]> The porn doesn't bother me.  The cat videos don't bother me.  But the rate at which complete drooling, eye-watering idiocy propagates and grows due to the Internet is really depressing.
[02:54:32] <drmpeg> ditto
[02:57:35] <drmpeg> I also wonder about my effect on China. It was thought that my MPEG-1 encoder authored many many Chinese VCD discs. And VCD sort of brought China out of it's "shell" back in the '90s.
[02:58:17] <patchvonbraun[m]> When I was a young teen, living in a big city, you'd routinely encounter wild-eyed lunatics on street corners.  Shouting about whatever deluson had entered their heads.  They'd be entertaining for a few minutes.  But now, those same folks have Youtube media emptires and thousands and thousands of followers.
[02:59:45] <drmpeg> Yup. But there's also a lack of critical thinking by many.
[03:00:24] <drmpeg> Folks have no BS detector these days.
[03:00:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> drmpeg: Well, sure, but back in the days of the soapbox-on-a-corner, you'd attract a few folks with little critical thinking skills.  Now, you can vacuum them up wholesale.
[03:01:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> Yes, it's a step-change in the way education works these days, but it's also just the social dynamics of lunacy that has been facilitated by the Internet.
