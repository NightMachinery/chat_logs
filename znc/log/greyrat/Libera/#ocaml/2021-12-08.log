[05:35:51] <d_bot> <NULL> Do you already know about monads? About ocaml's monadic operators? To have a baseline
[05:39:59] <hackinghorn> ah, I have no idea
[05:42:12] <d_bot> <NULL> Unfortunately, I don't have enough insight yet about monads in programming (I'm still currently learning about them) so I'm not really comfortable explaining them from the ground up

[05:50:01] <qwr> basically syntactic sugar for some code patters - if you don't know monads then javascripts async is a bit similar
[06:18:45] <d_bot> <leviroth> In what context are you seeing `let%bind`?
[06:20:20] <d_bot> <leviroth> I've found that it was easier to understand by using it with a specific monad (`Async.Deferred`) and gradually getting used to it than by reading an Explanation Of Monads

[13:18:00] <d_bot> <bnguyenv> I don't know, but in case it's useful, there was some discussion recently about how to look at ppx output here: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/merlin-vs-ocaml-lsp/8887/19 (using `-dsource` or the VSCode plugin)
[13:32:09] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> I see, thanks ðŸ™‚
[13:32:25] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> Unrelated: where can I find more documentation about compiler warnings https://github.com/lucasaiu/ocaml/blob/master/utils/warnings.ml ? As in, when precisely are they triggered
[13:33:26] <d_bot> <cod1r> Hi!
[13:38:14] <d_bot> <octachron> @Continuation Calculus , beyond `-warn-help`, there is some more more detailed explanation at https://ocaml.org/manual/comp.html#s%3Acomp-warnings for few warnings. However, this warning documentation is lazily updated (and `Lazy.force` in this case can be implemented by opening an issue for a missing warning explanation).
[13:39:05] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> Hahaha, I see ðŸ˜„
[13:39:40] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> Directly on https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues ?

[13:42:27] <d_bot> <octachron> Yes, particularly if you can motivate the need for a better documentation. Like this, I would have another reason  (beyond `that ought to be done`) to write down the documentation.
[13:42:34] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> oh, i understood. i used `Ppxlib.Driver.standalone ()`, but it preserves the ppx annotations instead of removing them
[13:42:45] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> so i got the ppx code included two times
[13:44:35] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> (and the first type declaration was shadowed, making it unused)

[13:48:33] <d_bot> <Continuation Calculus> is it possible to have a single dune command that watches two sub commands? I'd prefer avoiding changing my dune files (by adding a new rule for instance) for this, and having two separate `--watch` sometimes create locks/conflicts
