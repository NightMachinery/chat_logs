[02:50:30] <arhue> I wish there was a feature to upload images to an object store
[02:50:50] <arhue> I wanna enable uploading images but my thelounge instance is behind a firewall
[02:50:56] <arhue> I don't wanna publicly expose it
[02:59:16] <johncs> arhue: if you don't mind doing the heavy lifting, the lounge could be configured to do that without too much hassle.
[02:59:32] <johncs> set up the upload directory to automatically sync with the object store of your choice
[02:59:57] <arhue> That makes sense. I will try that
[03:00:22] <arhue> I think I can also configure nginx vhosts listening on multiple addresses but that would be messy
[03:00:58] <johncs> You mean you have a separate public interface that you'd be ok serving the files from? The nginx config for that would be straightforward
[03:01:58] <arhue> Yes. I have a /29 publicly routable IPv4 subnet, along with /64 IPv6 which is public and a /24 v4 behind NAT /64 IPv6 firewalled 
[03:02:09] <arhue> I am running thelounge in a LXC container
[03:02:45] <johncs> From nginx's point of view, the upload directory is just a normal directory. The config for that doesn't have be linked up with the lounge at all.
[03:03:20] <arhue> Right, that makes sense. But adding a public interface adds the headache of securing it from outside attacks
[03:03:43] <arhue> Like I need to make sure SSH or other services aren't listening on public interface
[03:05:19] <arhue> Also the domain which I have will identify me by my name, which I don't want to do. So either I need to buy a domain and do that or use something like S3 with cloudfront
[03:05:28] <arhue> Thanks for your help tho, I'll set something up

[12:42:22] <johncs> bookworm: do you want me to expose an instance running the pre-release to test on?
[12:42:35] <johncs> I can also wait, but figured I'd offer
[12:43:09] <Activ8> johncs that would be great actually just for device testers, maybe a couple test logins
[12:43:16] <bookworm> I mean if you can reproduce this (via emulator or one of your old phones?) I trust that you in fact can
[12:43:38] <Activ8> we have that many devices now we can't test over all of them
[12:43:53] <bookworm> I can easily spin up a test instance too, that ain't the problem
[12:44:14] <bookworm> (on my way to work)
[12:44:47] <johncs> Haha I just mean temporarily Activ8, I don't really wanna host a public instance
[12:45:10] <johncs> And sounds good bookworm. Yeah I reproduced it on my physical device
[12:45:35] <Activ8> it can be temporary I never said permanently lol something you can spin up in couple seconds
[12:45:43] <bookworm> If the bug is already there on master I don't see a point in delaying the merge of the fix. After all the current state is broken, so...
[12:46:15] <bookworm> we still have the disabling commit non reverted after all
[12:46:58] <Activ8> is this issue just now related to android

[12:49:46] <johncs> I meant _very_ temporarily. b-ookworm has just mentioned that he didn't have access to his computer for testing the Android fix on an earlier version. I was just going to bring one up for him to use for a few minutes.
[12:50:42] <Activ8> oh for sure
[12:50:47] <bookworm> I could use the phone but with my typing skills it's no fun to handle git and vim
[12:51:02] <Activ8> wiggle test 
[12:51:09] <Activ8> hey he's a wiggly bookworm
[12:51:31] <Activ8> you can call it the wiggle bug
[12:54:00] <johncs> There's a bunch of touch behaviors that are kinda unintuitive. Like iOS at least does some strange things with hover states that's surprising sometimes (you'll touch and it won't create a click, but will instead show the hover styles). I imagine Android has its fair share of complicated things as well.
[12:55:28] <Activ8> you would have thought both parties would have fixed stuff like that
[12:55:33] <Activ8> after all it's a touch device
[12:55:45] <johncs> Well they're not bugs
[12:55:55] <johncs> They're trying to let users activate hover states on websites
[12:55:58] <bookworm> depends on your view
[12:55:59] <johncs> Because they're often important
[12:56:01] <Activ8> then if they not bugs what are they
[12:56:07] <Activ8> it either works or it doesn't
[12:56:52] <Activ8> oh this is a new thing not related from just current touch devices.  As in sortables.js stuff

[12:57:15] <johncs> Those are OS behaviors
[12:57:23] <bookworm> Activ8: I can color my barn red or pink, neither is a bug, some may like one more than the other. Same goes for programming, there's always choices

[13:30:47] <johncs> OSS is a wacky world. I wish I'd found my way into it as a kid, I think I would've enjoyed it.
[13:31:21] <Activ8> OSS?
[13:31:27] <johncs> Open Source Software
[13:31:33] <Activ8> for sure
[13:32:43] <johncs> I mostly made bots for games as a kid, and then contract work. But there's so many cool project communities I feel like would've been fun to get into. Like I did a bunch of stuff for IRC but never thought to actually contribute to a client or server or anything. Just made my own little siloed stuff.
[13:33:08] <johncs> But fun doing it as an adult now :). And it's all way less intimidating as an adult too üòÖ.
[13:39:15] <Activ8> I think, with OSS there's potentially a place to make serious money with things but it doesn't happen.  I see a lot of software now free but that has different costs to certain things like features, support, server hosting e.t.c and I really think there's some potential with this model.
[13:39:29] <Activ8> feature rich

[17:05:57] <bookworm> but that's not a TL problem per se
[17:06:38] <FieryMewtwo> I just don't know really how to do it, because there are only Debian packages in the release. 
[17:06:51] <bookworm> what OS does it run then?
[17:07:03] <FieryMewtwo> what? the hosting?
[17:08:10] <FieryMewtwo> I really don't know. But I'm pretty sure that it won't let me run linux 'packages' whatsoever. Just php and js
[17:08:25] <FieryMewtwo> And some html/css
[17:08:38] <FieryMewtwo> I can't even get node.js to work
[17:09:04] <FieryMewtwo> <bookworm> sorry I don't have any more details
[17:09:54] <FieryMewtwo> Should I just upload the files in the source zip and open the directory in my browser?
[17:10:14] <majavah> I'd recommend asking the hosting provider
[17:10:39] <bookworm> ^ is sane advice, but as long as you can deploy a node app you're fine
