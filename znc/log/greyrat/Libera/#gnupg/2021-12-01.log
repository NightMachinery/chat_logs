[02:53:54] <JollyRoger> Hey henk, hey daddy and duxsco! 
[02:54:15] <duxsco> hi JollyRoger
[02:54:40] <JollyRoger> I'm on the lookout for a card that could be made to support ed25519 too. I know that JavaCard 3.0.5 has promised support for ed25519 in the specification, and I think I've seen some cards online but I haven't found a price on them or anything beyond an elusive "contact sales" button so I haven't bookmarked them.
[02:54:40] <duxsco> henk, here are my thoughts on smartcard and different gpg algorithms: https://github.com/duxsco/gpg-smartcard#create-a-gnupg-keypair
[02:56:10] <duxsco> thx for the info daddy
[02:57:26] *** phryk_ is now known as phryk
[02:58:40] <JollyRoger> duxsco: just taking a look now! I'm really glad people are trying to carry on the torch of producing GPG documentation... I tried and it's been hell on earth.
[03:04:09] <duxsco> üëç
[03:05:58] <JollyRoger> If I find any JavaCards that support 3.1, I'll swing back here and give you a shout!
[03:06:39] <duxsco> thanks, that would be great!

[16:41:58] <Plasmoduck> how to fix this
[16:42:12] <Plasmoduck> gpg: public key decryption failed: No pinentry
[16:42:14] <Plasmoduck> gpg: decryption failed: No pinentry
[16:44:34] <henk> Plasmoduck: what does 'type -a pinentry' return?
[16:46:42] <Plasmoduck> pinentry is /usr/local/bin/pinentry
[16:46:44] <Plasmoduck> pinentry is /usr/local/bin/pinentry
[16:51:09] <Plasmoduck> henk: any idea?
[16:53:08] <henk> hm, I‚Äôm assuming /usr/local/bin is not in your $PATH or better: in gpg-agent‚Äôs $PATH. but I‚Äôm not certain ‚Ä¶ IIRC freebsd installs a lot of software to /usr/local/bin, right? if that‚Äôs the case they should have everything in place so stuff can deal with it ‚Ä¶
[16:54:15] <henk> I‚Äôm not sure what the _proper_ solution would be and would advise to ask freebsd people about it. but as a workaround it might help to specify ¬ªpinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry¬´ in your gpg-agent.conf. or ln -s /usr/local/bin/pinentry /usr/bin/pinentry
[16:54:52] <henk> try these, restart gpg-agent (gpgconf --kill gpg-agent), and try again to decrypt or sign something
[16:58:02] <Plasmoduck> I already have pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-dmenu in my gpg-agent.conf
[17:01:54] <Plasmoduck> its just something weird I have done I guess
[17:04:10] <henk> if /usr/local/bin/pinentry-dmenu exists, I‚Äôm currently out of ideas apart from cranking up the debug level ‚Ä¶
[17:04:30] <Plasmoduck> how do I change the debug level

[20:21:50] <danisanti> hi all! A key has the ability to certify and to sign. What is the difference between the capability of signing and the capability of certifying? What is signing and what is certifying? Thank you
[20:23:11] <GyrosGeier> signing is data, certifying is other keys
[20:23:31] <GyrosGeier> the operation at low level is the same
[20:23:45] <danisanti> ohhh, easy. Thank you GyrosGeier!
[20:25:17] <danisanti> is signing making sure that some data has your approval?
[20:26:03] <GyrosGeier> you define yourself what it means
[20:26:20] *** Joins: Betal (~Betal@user/betal)
[20:26:23] <GyrosGeier> it just says "I have placed a signature under this data at this time"
[20:26:57] <GyrosGeier> e.g. a timestamping service would sign any data without looking at it, and the signature means "this data has existed at this point in time"
[20:27:33] <GyrosGeier> but if you sign an email, you'd express that this is an email you actually sent
[20:28:09] <GyrosGeier> and if you sign a request to a bot that buys domain names, it is a signature under a contract
[20:28:12] <GyrosGeier> etc.
[20:28:15] <GyrosGeier> so it's context dependent
[20:28:34] <danisanti> GyrosGeier: right. understood
[20:29:26] <GyrosGeier> a signature can have some auxiliary data attached
[20:29:33] <GyrosGeier> for data, noone ever looks at those
[20:29:38] <danisanti> GyrosGeier: not a good thing to accumulate internet domain names ;-)
[20:30:01] <GyrosGeier> for certification, there is a standard for saying how thoroughly you checked the identity
[20:31:17] <danisanti> GyrosGeier: yes, keysigning
