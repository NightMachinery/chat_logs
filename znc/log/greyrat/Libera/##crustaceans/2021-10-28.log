[00:06:10] <dimadima> lol prussian
[00:06:33] <dimadima> that's amazing
[00:07:13] <dimadima> https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1453333893017489427
[00:07:13] <buttsbot> Twitter - MKBHD - @SnazzyQ This is top notch design
[00:08:57] <dimadima> "< kline> i honestly dont even mind notches" are there other laptops w/ notches? or you mean iphones etc
[00:09:18] <kline> iphones etc
[00:09:29] <dimadima> i think it's really nice on the iphones that have it
[00:09:34] <kline> where admittedly it is much easier to manage
[00:09:37] <dimadima> adds work the dev side :/
[00:09:48] <kline> sure, i get that entirely
[00:09:57] <kline> but the excuse doesnt fly when you're fabricating your own silicon
[00:09:58] <dimadima> anyway doesn't bother me at all really wither
[00:10:17] <dimadima> technically TSMC is making the silicon
[00:10:19] <kline> if you have time to design your own CPU, you have time to make sure that the notch is a no-go zone for clickable elements
[00:10:22] <dimadima> >:)
[00:10:37] <dimadima> yeah that's ridiculous
[00:10:43] <dimadima> but is there even a solution?
[00:10:55] <dimadima> w/o exposing new APIs for devs
[00:10:58] <dimadima> (did they?)
[00:11:23] <dimadima> i'm guessing if devs don't account for the notch it just does what the video shows; otherwise they can program around it
[00:11:28] <kline> well, the top bar on osx is special anyway, you cant write arbitrarily into it
[00:11:36] <kline> so the control over rendering it is with the os
[00:11:51] <dimadima> but you can specify the menus and their layouts
[00:11:55] <indigo> dimadima: Any way to file Pony bugs? :D
[00:11:56] <kline> so the easiest thing to do is just present it as screenwidth - notchwidth pixels wide
[00:12:13] <kline> and then just split the actual pixel-to-screen rendering across the two sub-sections
[00:12:25] <kline> you could end up with stuff split across the divide but still
[00:12:33] <kline> this is literally me giving it 15s thought
[00:12:42] <dimadima> indigo: that would be so much appreciated, so any way you want; there's discord, there's twitter, there's IRC /query
[00:12:55] <dimadima> there's freaking email; you can call me lol (number is in "support" and the welcome letter)
[00:13:02] <dimadima> carried pigeon, you know name it
[00:13:03] <indigo> For sure, just wondering what is the most convenient for you
[00:13:11] <kline> someone who already worked on and knew that code would be able to implement it as two independent parts in a day, or even a week if it turned out to be harder than expected
[00:13:14] <dimadima> no my job is to get it into GH issue
[00:13:16] <kline> but surely no more than that
[00:15:04] <dimadima> kline: you don't think they exposed API for that? just split it?
[00:15:30] <kline> i have no idea what they did or didnt do
[00:15:42] <kline> other than that they didnt do it right
[00:15:43] <dimadima> there are some questions in that video that i never considered; like what happens if the icons on the right exceed the width needed by the menu on the left--even w/o the notch
[00:15:49] <kline> but this isnt a fundamentally hard problem
[00:16:33] <kline> dimadima, that question is just a special case of the previously solved "what if the icons need more width than is available on the screen" in notchless macs
[00:16:55] <kline> you have to cut some, allow scrolling, or add a drawer
[00:16:58] <dimadima> indigo: if you find yourself needing to type, the web app is better for that
[00:17:12] <dimadima> kline: yeah that's what i meant
[00:17:20] <indigo> dimadima: iOS 15.0.2 on iPhone. I was trying to send you a dank meme, so I saved a photo into my Photo Library from Google images. Turns out it was a WebP, and when I tried to load it into Pony, I get the following error: https://imgur.com/OPjj82Q .
[00:17:20] <buttsbot> Imgur: The magic of the Internet
[00:17:35] <kline> again, i fully agree that notches pose _some_ additional work
[00:17:39] <indigo> Fucking WebP, amirite
[00:17:51] <kline> i just reject that this work should have been a surprise to apple
[00:18:05] <kline> mostly i can only assume that they didnt care
[00:18:06] <dimadima> yeah no webp support; but it's arbitrary; i have a GH issue for both expanding format support and improving the error message
[00:18:18] <dimadima> indigo: even photoshop doesn't support webp out of the box though; is webp proprietary or something?
[00:18:29] <dimadima> sharp seems to support, and i use sharp
[00:18:58] <Brekkjern> >Why did Google release WebP as open source?
[00:18:59] <indigo> No worries :-) pretty low priority, I just noticed that the native iOS messages + photos app does support WebP, so my user expectation is that all apps should support WebP
[00:19:01] <dimadima> ie lbivips
[00:19:12] <Brekkjern> So it's OS
[00:19:22] <kline> isnt webp just VP9?
[00:19:31] <kline> but with static images rather than video
[00:20:17] <Brekkjern> >As a derivative of the VP8 video format, it is a sister project to the WebM multimedia container format.
[00:20:42] <dimadima> kline: personally i just find the whole notch-shitting thing annoying. in my world, the only irredemable thing apple did all these years design-wise was the touchbar
[00:21:07] <indigo> The hockey puck mouse was pretty egregious
[00:21:08] <kline> dimadima, i think the touchbar was silly but the real issue was removing the function keys/esc/etc
[00:21:15] <kline> if they had both they would have been fine
[00:21:19] <dimadima> kline: yes, that was the worst thing about it
[00:21:31] <dimadima> like did they forget steve ballmer ?
[00:21:31] <buttsbot> üëè developers üëè developers üëè developers üëè
[00:21:40] <dimadima> ^
[00:21:44] <kline> tbh i quite like the idea of the touchbar other than headshotting good bits of the keyboard for experimental bits of the keyboard
[00:21:53] <dimadima> me too
[00:22:01] <dimadima> but developersdevelopersdevelopersdevelopers
[00:22:07] <kline> my #1 issue with apple is that they produced the consumer fetish for THIN AT ALL COSTS
[00:22:08] <dimadima> you can't nuke the F keys
[00:22:34] <dimadima> indigo: the puck mouse is trash too. i've never liked any apple mouse ever, but that predates all this laptop stuff by decades at this point
[00:22:38] <indigo> Heheh
[00:22:47] <dimadima> i enjoy the standalone touchpads a lot though
[00:23:08] <indigo> Btw, nice work on the overall onboarding + UX. This is all you right?
[00:23:52] <dimadima> kline: i heard when you join their design team they make you read tht book by bethany frankel "skinny bitch"
[00:24:13] <dimadima> indigo: oh man that means a lot, thank you
[00:24:15] <dimadima> yep, all me
[00:24:41] <dimadima> it's amazing what you can do with a wkwebview, i'll tell you
[00:25:23] <indigo> Ooh, WKWebView + React Native?
[00:25:35] <dimadima> hopefully i'll get traction and continue exploiting it. i think it can be made to feel quite native except for the problem that when you go low power mode it drops to 30fps
[00:25:50] <dimadima> indigo: nope, just the webview lol :/

[00:27:12] <dimadima> and if you read hacker news and are naive and foolish like me, then you see posts titled "build a website first" circa 2017 and think "gosh that's a good diea"
[00:27:34] <dimadima> (not a good idea if you're trying to make an "app" that people will "use")
[00:28:04] <dimadima> so yada yada i cornered myself into using web technologies to build apps :(
[00:28:23] <dimadima> i want to write a blog about this, too, shitting on hackernews and its tomfoolery
[00:28:41] <dimadima> indigo: i would have been better the soviet way

[00:31:31] <dimadima> wait indigo, was that the bug report
[00:31:38] <dimadima> sorry i was ranting
[00:32:45] <indigo> No worries, but yes. The WebP thing
[00:33:19] <indigo> Using web technologies to build an app might be more scalable tbf, especially for a single engineer
[00:34:22] <dimadima> indigo: it's true, it worked out in the sense that i now have mobile and web.
[00:34:51] <dimadima> and most importantly, in a way, the rich text editing is a single editor with a single format
[00:35:37] <dimadima> juggling various rich text editors and their formats must be very difficult
[00:36:28] <dimadima> anyway, i had no idea messages supported webp. should be pretty turnkey for me so i'll test it out and deploy it if work smoothly. thanks aain
[00:37:53] <dimadima> again*
[00:38:31] <indigo> No worries dude :) thank you
[01:16:50] <dimadima> man... such a high percentage of things i think are fraud/abuse turn out to be bugs
[01:21:15] <dimadima> is this a common experience

[01:29:08] <dimadima> KPIs?
[01:29:14] <imode> key performance indicators.
[01:29:48] <dimadima> indigo: totally. it bites me in the ass over and over. i think a two nights ago was my first and only real case of abuse/fraud; others--bugs

[01:33:42] <imode> yeah #startups lmao.
[01:34:19] <dimadima> but yeah if you were curious, earlier i got an alert that someone was uploading attachments a lot; i don't actually rate limit attachments, but GKE makes it easy to set up logging alerts. i start tailing the logs and it looked like, yes, a user is uploading attachments over and over. curiously i couldn't actually find these attachments when i began investigating; and then my kid woke up etc etc
[01:34:33] <dimadima> and the log patterns looked very human and normal
[01:34:54] <dimadima> having reviewed it a while after the fact, it seems like it had to have been a bug. that is all
[01:35:11] <imode> how'd you know it was a bug.
[01:35:29] <dimadima> i did regrettably panic an deployed a version of my backend without attachment uploads turned off; i knew it was dumb as i was doing it--who cares??!?!--but did it anyway
[01:35:34] <dimadima> i don't know for sure
[01:35:52] <dimadima> but i haven't been able to find these uploads in the gs:// bucket
[01:36:12] <dimadima> i think there must be a bug that was re-uploading the same file over and over again
[01:38:41] <dimadima> (got your KPIs joke btw, sorry slow due to drained-ness)
[01:39:23] <dimadima> i need to just chill out
[01:39:57] <dimadima> and stop looking at logs and set up better alerts

[07:06:15] <imode> sourcehut is a "give us your project and we'll map you to available resources, but we retain them".
[07:06:21] <imode> (iirc).
[07:06:52] <dimadima> i don't know anything about the writers guild of america
[07:07:50] <imode> a guild's original purpose was to serve as a sort of.. group or association of craftsmen. people who are the "old people" of their professions.
[07:08:43] <imode> if you're a member, you gain access to multiple perks, the community within the guild, and notoriety.
[07:09:09] <imode> it's effectively an older form of labor union.
[07:10:03] <dimadima> guilds died though when they lost their monopolies in the industrial revolution, iirc
[07:10:20] <imode> yeah they got uh.. bloated.
[07:10:45] <imode> they evolved to the level of needing antitrust laws.
[07:13:03] <defect> dimadima: i studied computer science and engineering. the science parts of it seemed kinda interesting, but the engineering parts is what was most relevant to my career
[07:15:45] <defect> or, what has been most relevant
[07:15:59] <imode> computer engineering?
[07:17:18] <defect> i went to college in sweden. it's a bit heavier on the practical side rather than the pure science of computing
[07:17:48] <defect> computer engineering might not be the best term, but i don't know what else to call it :)
[07:18:12] <dimadima> systems design?
[07:18:28] <defect> is that a major?
[07:19:02] <defect> i dunno. i have a MSc, but don't want to call myself a scientist
[07:19:26] <defect> because it was much more practical
[07:20:34] <dimadima> i just made that up
[07:20:57] <dimadima> i don't think that's a major
[07:21:07] <defect> hehe
[07:21:16] <defect> i don't know. no one seems to care
[07:21:27] <imode> it's a subset of the field.
[07:23:57] <defect> i think my main takeaways from college was being more outgoing and learning how to learn
[07:26:10] <dimadima> i bet a cirriculum designed around something like http://aosabook.org/en/index.html would be practical
[07:26:10] <buttsbot> The Architecture of Open Source Applications
[07:26:16] <dimadima> these books like super nice
[07:26:56] <dimadima> who knows if actually good
[07:28:46] <defect> i'd love a course or two based on that
[07:29:04] <defect> but maybe not a whole curriculum
[07:31:44] <dimadima> yeah i was thinking more like bootcamp not whole degree program
[07:31:51] <imode> trade school.
[07:31:54] <defect> yeah, that be nice
[07:32:11] <imode> treat it like it's a trade, because it is.
[07:33:21] <defect> that'd kinda split it up between "architects" and "implementers
[07:33:27] <defect> woudln't it?
[07:33:42] <imode> yyyyup.
[07:34:54] <imode> that's already the split. you have new devs getting to grips with small-scale organization and design, and old devs that have experience working on larger systems.
[07:35:03] <imode> it's literally what defines our salary splits.
[07:36:16] <defect> but new devs can climb upwards
[07:36:25] <imode> correct.
[07:36:25] <defect> that's not happening in construction for instance
[07:36:45] <imode> it does happen.
[07:37:02] <imode> you can absolutely move from rough framing to designing and planning.
[07:37:06] <imode> my father did that. his father did that.
[07:37:15] <imode> that's the idea of a trade.
[07:37:25] <imode> same with electricians.
[07:39:19] <defect> what would a developer trade school cover?
[07:41:31] <defect> in my mind things are still so volatile that what a school teaches one year would be obsolete pretty soon
[07:41:35] <imode> introductions to computing and computability, common human-driven/readable examples of algorithms in your everyday life, the "number line of abstraction" (from low low low to high high high), how different abstraction levels map between eachother, common algorithms in these languages.
[07:42:19] <imode> but before algorithms, the motivation behind them: basic problem decomposition, an overview of top-down vs. bottom-up problem solving and implementation, _debugging_ and logical thinking.
[07:43:14] <imode> it's not hard. and it doesn't go away. I've taught it. and it does work.
[07:43:46] <imode> you make history and fundamentals a large part of what you teach. you don't have to reach for a language until much later.

[16:18:58] <gwozniak> So wonderful.  I bought this so that I could mess around with some stuff at some point and it turns out it doesn't work with my setup.

There are still constraints, as always, but their design consequences are, at present, completely unexplored.

[18:21:24] <kline> i dont think nasa will become irrelevant but i do think theyll become "just another player" in an increasingly commercialised space
[18:21:35] <kline> im not sure thats a good thing but it definitely isnt a bad thing
[18:21:49] <Brekkjern> Despite the math errors on the number of rovers they will be able to send, it will change how you approach creating a rover
[18:21:51] <kline> in the meantime, spacex is the company making the most ground
[18:22:19] <kline> Brekkjern, i fully believe that spacex will send their own rover at some point
[18:22:20] <Brekkjern> At some point there will be competitors to SpaceX as well, further pushing prices and increasing availability
[18:23:18] <Brekkjern> I don't see why NASA should spend as much time building new rockets when there are other launch systems that could do the job reasonably well
[18:23:20] <kline> nasa will fall into the domain of high science, the places where govt grants are already the primary funding and more and more practical stuff like exploration (and exploitation) will be commercial

[21:14:06] <jjuran> indigo: Which, the meta-wish expy, or jwz quote?
[21:14:27] <indigo> The "build another ML algorithm to track accuracy of the first one"
[21:14:50] <gerikson> "how many problems do we have now? No idea, we need ML to know"
[21:14:55] <jjuran> Heh.  I was being entirely facetious when I said it.
[21:15:13] <jjuran> Overly optimistic, I'm afraid‚Ä¶

[21:18:29] <indigo> ngoldbaum: Five years from now, there is the hope that everyone has been promoted and doing something else
[21:18:49] <indigo> Not to mention two years from now it is quite possible that everything will be rewritten to achieve that promotion
[21:20:23] <gwozniak> Or the manager will be replaced with ML, who will spawn more ML
[21:20:37] <gwozniak> "Just look for patterns!"

[21:35:08] <indigo> > Within Valiant's model of learning as formalized by Kearns, we show that computable total predicates for two formally uncomputable problems (the classical Halting Problem, and the Halting Problem relative to a specified oracle) are formally learnable from examples, to arbitrarily high accuracy with arbitrarily high confidence, under any
[21:35:08] <indigo> probability distribution.
[21:35:27] <indigo> Wow, ok ML
[21:38:30] <imode> whorglblorgm.
[21:40:42] <imode> "an ML algorithm to predict whether it was slow or fast." ... why not build an ML "algorithm" to solve the halting problem.
[21:41:28] <indigo> You can! That's the quote I posted (from https://www.ics.uci.edu/~rickl/publications/1996-icml.pdf)
[21:41:29] <buttsbot> 404 Not Found
[21:41:44] <imode> for fuck's sake.
[21:42:06] <imode> that's infuriating.
[21:42:37] <indigo> But it makes intuitive sense, right? For some example programs, you can predict whether they will halt/won't halt
[21:42:45] <imode> yes, and we can guess all we like.
[21:43:15] <imode> which is all that is.

[21:45:41] <imode> function approximation is great until you don't have an idea of what the function should even look like because the input space is so disorganized it's ridiculous.

[22:12:55] <imode> he's not a good person.
[22:13:07] <Brekkjern> Dude...
[22:13:11] <Brekkjern> He made weapons...
[22:13:14] <dimadima> i can't click that right now but i'm not sure i wouldn't be at all surprised if that video is as cool as it portends
[22:13:26] <dimadima> i would be*
[22:13:36] <dimadima> that video portends to be awesome
[22:13:41] * dimadima portends
[22:13:49] <imode> port end.
[22:15:01] <ngoldbaum> imode: he‚Äôs a conservative republican who works at a weapons contractor
[22:15:13] <imode> yeah, so fuck him.
[22:15:13] <ngoldbaum> he does do a good job of keeping all that out of his videos though‚Ä¶
[22:15:26] <imode> he paid some street performer in africa to eat glass.
[22:15:40] <imode> he can get blown up for all I care.
[22:15:52] <Brekkjern> He probably will be at some point
[22:16:11] <dimadima> imode: that's fucked up
[22:16:24] <dimadima> hopefully someone will blow him up
[22:16:27] <imode> he posted a video blog on it too lmao.

[22:27:23] <dimadima> he has a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders?
[22:27:38] <imode> I'm gonna start using that as an excuse lmao.
[22:27:47] <dimadima> that's the best one
[22:31:05] <riv> well eating glass is a common magic trick
[22:31:16] <imode> he spat out blood.
[22:31:36] <dimadima> i can't imagine it ended there
[22:31:43] <riv> huh apparently Derren Brown make an audience member eat glass too
[22:31:52] <riv> but you never know what's real...
[22:32:00] <dimadima> although apparently people with pica can eat all kinds of shit
[22:32:02] <riv> like it could be another magician planted in the audience, or fake glass etc.
[22:32:36] <dimadima> aka people
[22:32:53] <riv> "While there's no trick in the sense that he's really eating the glass, there's definitely a technique to it. He also mentions that he stick to a pretty strict diet that is designed to help him pass the foreign objects he ingests. He says that the diet is pretty critical to not hurting yourself"
[22:32:57] <riv> scary
[22:34:23] <riv> oh he got james cordon to eat it

[23:17:14] <pja> /Finally/ got pull backups working over ssh to my backup server. What a pain.
[23:18:31] <pja> This adventure brought to you by ssh remote unix sockets, extra ssh options, socat, ssh keys & a bunch of other stuff.
[23:18:59] <pja> But it works! I can have daily incremental backups without having to remember to shove a usb stick in the thing (which never happens of course).
[23:21:21] <riv> would be really cool to read the details of
[23:22:40] <imode> +1.
[23:27:36] <pja> riv: I‚Äôll see if I can write it all up. The borg docs are not bad, but skip a few details if you want everything to just work with public keys & ssh commands.
[23:28:29] <pja> But the idea of using ssh-agent on the backup server to feed the correct login secret key to the client, so you only have the key available on the client when actually carrying out a backup is neat.
[23:29:29] <companion_cube> there's borgmatic, it helps
[23:29:34] <companion_cube> (although it adds its own layer of magic)
[23:30:51] <pja> companion_cube: The problem I needed to solve was that the backup server is inside the NATed part of my network, whilst the server I wanted to backup is not.
[23:33:14] <pja> So the only way to make a connection is to ssh out from the backup server, setting up a unix socket on the client which is connected via the ssh tunnel to the ssh tcp socket on the backup server. This ssh is forced (via the authorized_keys file) to run a borg backup job, which connects via ssh over that unix socket using an socat proxy back to the backup server, using the authentication key
[23:33:17] <pja> made available to it over ssh-agent to authorise itself. There‚Äôs a corresponding authorized_keys file on the backup server to run "borg serve" in response.
[23:33:34] <pja> It‚Äôs an astonishing rube-goldberg creation, but it works!
[23:34:28] <pja> You have ssh going forwards & backwards & two sets of authorized_keys files to get right.
[23:35:54] <companion_cube> seems awful :p
[23:36:34] <pja> It‚Äôs ... not exactly intuitive ;)
[23:37:52] <imode> why not wire things up with tinc.
[23:37:57] <imode> you're effectively doing the same thing.
[23:39:35] <pja> Look, telling me I could have done the whole thing more simply some other way is ruining the mood :)
[23:39:37] <indigo> Or Tailscale
[23:40:02] <pja> (Although could I have a temporary VPN with tinc?)
[23:40:03] <cb_> https://lobste.rs/s/ju4vut/run_macos_software_on_linux_using_darling i dont like the blogspam src here
[23:40:03] <buttsbot> Run MacOS Software On Linux Using Darling | Lobsters
[23:40:24] <imode> pja: yeah! you can absolutely have one. and sorry, don't mean to ruin the mood.
[23:40:27] <pja> The nice thing about ssh is I can generate fresh keys on a per connection basis if I want...
[23:40:38] <pja> jk imode.
[23:40:39] <imode> just that if you wanna shrink any of this infra there's a tool built for it.
[23:40:54] <pja> am happy to hear other solutions.
[23:42:07] <pja> Also, tinc has a history of security issues, whereas I just have to depend on ssh working correctly.
[23:42:19] <imode> valid!
[23:42:49] <imode> though they've been good at fixing them.
[23:42:54] <imode> nothing is without flaw.
[23:43:04] <pja> Absolutely.
[23:44:05] <pja> The other nice thing about the ssh solution is that by using commands in authorized keys you can force login with the relevant private key to run only that command.
[23:46:19] <pja> The downside is having to write command files that look like this: command="BORG_PASSPHRASE=$(cat /root/.borg-passphrase) borg create --rsh 'ssh -o \"ProxyCommand socat - UNIX-CLIENT:/root/.socket/borg-socket\" ' --compression auto,zstd -s -x -e /var/log/ ssh://borg-backup@localhost/~/hostname-repo::$(date +'%d-%m-%Y')-Everything / /home" ssh-ed25519 keydata keyname
[23:46:41] <pja> Hmm. I should probably drop /var/cache as well.
[23:46:51] <imode> ahh.. the wonderful glue that holds everything together.
[23:48:05] <pja> Unfortunately, ssh won‚Äôt connect to a unix socket, which is a bit annoying. Hence the need for socat.
[23:48:28] <pja> So it‚Äôs not actually connecting to localhost here. That‚Äôs just a placeholder / lie.
[23:54:58] *** dimadima is now known as dmitry
[23:55:08] *** dmitry is now known as dimadima
[23:55:13] <pja> I should have a look at tailscale at some point, but if we‚Äôre going to be modern, isn‚Äôt WireGuard the new hotness?
[23:55:51] <pja> Oh wait, tailscale is built on top of WireGuard. I did vaguely remember that.
