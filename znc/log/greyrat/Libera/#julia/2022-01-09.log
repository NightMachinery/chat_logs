[12:59:47] <adigitoleo> Noob question: is it fine to call helper methods from inside a testset? e.g. for setting up mock objects
[13:00:46] <ninjin> Yes, it absolutely should be adigitoleo.
[13:01:26] <ninjin> Test sets and related macros just help keeping track of failures, they are not some sort of weird closures by any means.
[13:01:37] <adigitoleo> cool thanks
[13:01:48] <ninjin> Any time, happy hacking!

[13:41:47] <adigitoleo> I don't see many projects having adopted test/Project.toml, are there some caveats or is it just that people don't want to mess with Travis?
[13:42:28] *** Joins: rito_ (~rito_gh@45.112.243.206)
[13:44:48] <ninjin> Not sure, I am sure the Pkg people on Slack would know.
[13:45:22] <ninjin> I do know some test-related features are not implemented, but I am a little behind in terms of what the state of things is.
[13:52:13] <adigitoleo> Hmm there's some talk of fragility in Pkg.jl #1788 but it's from over a year ago.
[13:52:28] <adigitoleo> I think I'll just try it and see how it goes.
[13:53:41] <ninjin> Are you using it for test-time dependencies? Maybe I am the one asking beginner questions now? ;P
[13:55:28] <adigitoleo> Well for the current project I don't need test-specific deps, but I will for the next one :) But also I don't want the Test pkg itself to be under my [deps] in the normal Project.toml
[13:55:54] <adigitoleo> I see that most people put it in [extras] and then use a rule in [target] as well
[13:56:17] <ninjin> Yeah, I thought the latter option there was standard.
[13:57:22] <adigitoleo> hah, even Pkg themselves do it that way, maybe I'll do that instead
[13:57:45] <adigitoleo> Got a bit confused by Pkg docs which kinda recommend the other way
[13:59:40] <ninjin> It could be that they are in some sort of transition period again. It would not be the first time.
[14:01:45] <adigitoleo> ideally package management should be language agnostic so we don't have to reinvent it every time, but hey I'm not a CS guy so what do I know ;)
[14:02:20] <adigitoleo> ( I do understand that it's tricky to do that though )
[14:03:45] <ninjin> To be fair, the package management “story” for most programming languages utterly blows. '^^ Julia is fairly advanced compared to what else there is in the dynamic languages sphere.
[14:04:09] <ninjin> Rust is excellent, but they have a much easier time as they compile.
[14:04:42] <adigitoleo> true, it's half of the reason I'm trying to escape from Python
[14:05:50] <ninjin> Yes, Python has been a travesty ever since I started with it in 2006. Nothing new to be said there, just that it never settles on anything even half decent.
[14:06:28] <ninjin> BinaryBuilder for Julia really is amazing though, it is borderline an OS-level package manager at that point.
