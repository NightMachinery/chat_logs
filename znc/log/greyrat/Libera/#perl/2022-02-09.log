[01:40:28] <Kaedenn> I have a function that I call `humanize($value, base=>'B')` and I want to write a function that accepts $value and %args and calls humanize with those two. How do I "splat" or "apply" %args to the function humanize?
[01:40:53] <Kaedenn> In Python, def wrapper(value, *args): return humanize(value, *args)
[01:41:03] <Kaedenn> In C, __VA_ARGS__
[01:41:16] <LeoNerd> You just pass it.   humanize($value, %args)
[01:42:25] <LeoNerd> Where in Python, containers are passed by reference and need the * operator to splat them out; in Perl they expand out to the list of values they contain, and would need a prefixed \ operator if you wanted to pass it by reference
[01:42:38] <Kaedenn> Oh, then the bug exists elsewhere in my code
[01:42:48] <LeoNerd> Perhaps so :)
[01:44:26] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@187.223.115.137)
[01:46:29] <Kaedenn> Yup, I renamed `base` to `from` and forgot to update the calling code :)
[01:46:37] <LeoNerd> Hah :)
[01:47:00] <LeoNerd> Yeah; we don't -currently- have helpers for that kind of thing, but I'm hoping to get some named-argument support into signatures one day, which should make that nicer
[01:47:13] <Kaedenn> I'm playing around with printing a number as a size where the caller can specify the starting unit and even the resulting format
[01:47:42] <Kaedenn> humanize(1024, from=>'B', format=>'%d %s') would give '1 K'
[01:47:50] <LeoNerd> Mm.. yeah there's a bunch of such modules already

[01:50:06] <Kaedenn> The system is *so old* that we're discouraged from installing *anything* on it. It lacks the tools to build things from source, so we're kinda' stuck where we are.

[01:57:25] <Kaedenn> ...actually, the printf is exactly what I want
[01:57:40] <LeoNerd> I'd usually use an unqq() function I tend to steal from B

[02:01:38] <LeoNerd> Line 16 is far better written   my ($num, %args) = @_;
[02:01:56] <LeoNerd> Or even if you use signatures, just write the entire function as  sub humanize ($num, %args) { ... }
[02:02:17] <LeoNerd> It's not usual to quote bareword keys in hashes; so simply  my $from = $args{from} || "K";
[02:02:28] <Kaedenn> Thank you, thank you, and thank you.
[02:02:28] <LeoNerd> Also quite common to use the // operator instead, which cares about definedness, not truth
[02:03:21] <Kaedenn> `Illegal character in prototype for main::humanize : $num,%args at ./test.pl line 14.` for `sub humanize($num, %args) {`
[02:03:39] <LeoNerd> Yeah you need to   use experimental 'signatures';   to enable it

[02:05:04] <Kaedenn> `my ($num, %args) = @_` oh thank you that's SO much better.
[02:05:05] <LeoNerd> Finally, it's uncommon to bother with putting the main code inside its own sub only to call it 'main' at the end; might as well just splat it right there into the actual toplevel script
[02:05:25] <Kaedenn> Yeah, that's a force of habit from writing so many proper scripts in Python
[02:05:43] <LeoNerd> If you're on something as old as 5.8.8 you won't have the // operator either then
[02:05:51] <LeoNerd> You're basically missing all of about the past 15 years of update :(

[05:13:45] <mmlj4> simple tests say not, but how would I do it?
[05:15:29] <speskk> I'm not sure honestly. Can I ask a bit more about what you're trying to do? In my mind I'd use a while for that

[05:18:02] <mmlj4> it's a pagination thing, output to LPR. I can detect whether I'm about to print off the end of the page, so I'd like to increment the number of times the loop runs, send a format character and do $page++
[05:18:36] <mmlj4> what I'm really trying to do is not use the old format construct, it's terminally broken (and the Perl6 modules don't work)
[05:19:12] <mmlj4> my pagination works fine, unless the loop rows end up larger than I intended, then the thing prints off the end of the page
[05:20:07] <mmlj4> maybe if I rewrite it as a while ()? it might work
[05:20:44] <mmlj4> or yeah, you already said that
[05:20:48] <aquanight> I think you cannot do it as a foreach
[05:20:53] <aquanight> but you can do it as a C-style for
[05:21:07] <aquanight> for (my $n = $start; $n <= $end; ++$n) { ... }

[05:22:20] <mmlj4> hmm...
[05:22:25] <speskk> Having no context, while is probably what I'd reach for, but you know your own code best. Perhaps the `for' is better in this case
[05:23:26] <mmlj4> the error is triggered if I have short loops, way one item per page, thus more than one stanza gets printed, thus screwing up my line counts, etc.
[05:23:33] <aquanight> the range construct more directly maps to the C-style for
[05:23:52] <mmlj4> i could waste paper and force each stanza on its own page, but I'd get yelled at, it's custom fanfold stuff
[05:24:42] <aquanight> if you're outputting text to a line printer, why not let the printer do the pagination?

[05:26:33] <gordonfish> Hmm. For three days now Youtube has been suggesting GroundHog Day in every video I've watched. I wonder if it'll ever stop.
[05:26:53] <mmlj4> I can't because it has pre-printed logos and crap that eats the first 11 lines of each page
[05:27:16] <mmlj4> gordonfish: have you tried electrocuting yourself?
[05:27:17] <aquanight> ...pre-printed logos??
[05:27:49] <aquanight> an alternative strategy: use a PDL that allows you to control the text layout.
[05:27:54] <aquanight> like postscript.
[05:28:05] <aquanight> or if you're feeling bold, PCLXL
[05:28:05] <mmlj4> fansold paper, triplicate, with the company logo printed at the top of every page, specially stuff from a local printer
[05:28:15] <aquanight> ah
[05:28:17] <mmlj4> specialty stuff, whatever
[05:28:35] <mmlj4> no, I almost have it solved
[05:29:04] <aquanight> fair enough
[05:29:12] <mmlj4> but I wasted weeks and weeks using the old format function, finally had to scrap it and write my own control code
[05:29:29] <aquanight> yeah format is awful really

[05:40:31] <Grinnz> they both auto escape 
[05:41:24] <Grinnz> Perl6::Form is better than using the inbuilt format functions if thats what you want, but thats not useful for html
[05:41:38] <mmlj4> Grinnz: that didn't work for me at all
[05:41:41] <Grinnz> (also it's not a perl6 module, it's just inspired from that)
[05:41:59] <Grinnz> didn't work how?
[05:42:15] <mmlj4> no, I normally use HTML::Template for HTML, but this project is ASCII sent to a dot-matrix printer
[05:42:59] <mmlj4> dinn't work as it spewed errors, it was too long ago for me to remember them though
[05:43:17] <Grinnz> well if sprintf works thats good, Perl6::Form is better at layouts though
[05:43:48] <Grinnz> which admittedly i never need to do, but that's what you're doing

[06:06:53] <krismatrix> It seems the perl and mojo syntax highlighting in vim is poorer than the one in vscode. Do you guys use a plugin to improve the syntax highlighting in vim?
[06:08:44] <mmlj4> Perl AND mojo? or just Perl?
[06:09:02] <mmlj4> I'm extremely happy with vim for Perl
[06:09:31] <krismatrix> I am not sure. Vim just seems to messup the syntax highlighting every now and then. Sometimes it corrects itself.
[06:09:54] <krismatrix> my code usually has a lot of perl, perlpod, and template strings i guess.
[06:10:03] <mmlj4> I think I've seen messups on either very long files, or something else
[06:10:17] <mmlj4> probably over dodgy ssh
[06:10:20] <krismatrix> Well...no individual files are longer than 300 lines.

[14:58:07] <aquanight> JayDoubleu: a bit curious what exactly you're trying to do. The nature of major revision being what it is... code you write to ensure 'perl5' possibly won't even run if the perl isn't v5 at this current point.
[15:00:03] <aquanight> but as long as you're within perl itself, $^V->{version}[0] will have the major version number
[15:00:11] <JayDoubleu> So I am trying to define RPM macro which I could reconstruct the perl_vendorlib one. 
[15:00:34] <JayDoubleu> So lets say rpm --eval '%{perl_vendorlib}' -> /usr/share/perl5/vendor_perl 
[15:00:46] <JayDoubleu> I just want to have the perl5 so I can construct that path myself
[15:01:02] <JayDoubleu> so if the revision of perl changes in future it would automatically go to perl6 for example etc
[15:01:36] <aquanight> well in that specific case, perl6 is raku :P
[15:02:27] <aquanight> but I get it. I think the current strategy in most pakagers is to just hardcode that value since perl bumping a major revision would probably be enough of a big deal
[15:03:09] <aquanight> but at one point there was consideration for a perl7 that would be somewhat compatible with perl5 stuff so I guess it could happen?

[15:03:59] <aquanight> but in that case, the $^V->{version}[0] strategy will work
[15:06:15] <JayDoubleu> I see. Now a completely silly question .. how do I get it executed from single liner perl -e 'sprintf "perl%d", $^V->{version}[0];' ?
[15:06:38] <aquanight> that would do it.
[15:06:46] <aquanight> well
[15:06:47] <aquanight> almost
[15:06:52] <aquanight> I would change sprintf to printf
[15:07:15] <JayDoubleu> ahh. That did it. Thanks !

[18:42:13] <krismatrix> I am managing to install things but I am not sure I fully grasp the conceptual underpinnings of docker. Because you can also pull images as well as install manually.
[18:42:31] <Botje> krismatrix: rule number one: containers are not VMs. stop trying to treat it as one
[18:42:39] <Botje> krismatrix: rule number two: composition over inheritance
[18:42:54] <Altreus> COPY FROM is quite powerful
[18:43:07] <Botje> (that means: use docker-compose to run each service as a separate container and treat the whole constellation as your application
[18:43:37] <Altreus> dg_dg: yes, I think a balance is good. On days when I work in the garden or on the house I'm a lot happier ... until I get bored of that and want to work on the computer again :D
[18:43:48] <krismatrix> each service meaning redis, postgresql and the mojo app are 3 services?
[18:43:54] <Botje> krismatrix: so basically, throw away all the redis and postgres bits and write a docker-compose file that takes them in separately.
[18:43:57] <Botje> yes.
[18:44:12] <Botje> if you can't find a perl example, steal one from rails or flask.
[18:44:13] <krismatrix> ugh..i don't know docker-compose well.
[18:44:18] <Altreus> seems Botje has this :)
[18:44:32] <krismatrix> is docker-compose anything like github actions?
[18:44:34] <Altreus> docker-compose is trivial in the common cases tbh
[18:44:49] <Botje> krismatrix: no. it is simply a textual format to describe a constellation of services running as containers.
[18:45:00] <Altreus> Botje: I'm sure that cleared it up :D
[18:45:06] <Botje> (and also the name of the binary that orchestrates said containers)
[18:45:57] <krismatrix> what is the difference between container and image. The dockerfile I posted only creates images but not containers it seems.
[18:46:10] <Altreus> When you run an image you get a container
[18:46:17] <Altreus> You can make several containers from the same image
[18:46:36] <krismatrix> ah..thx u
[18:46:53] <Altreus> Once you know that it seems clear from the labels eh :D
[18:47:06] <dg_dg> Altreus, exact, use both is the best way to be in good condition. The badest life to be is to work in the manufactory product chain to do repetitive stupid tasks... i did it when young for cheap money by obligation and it is incredibly not for humans. It should be forbiden.

[18:47:51] <Botje> krismatrix: there are two services (postgres and web), and the "web" service is built on demand from a Dockerfile.
[18:48:07] <Altreus> Botje: Since you know what you're talking about, I've been told that they've given up on docker swarm in favour of docker-compose ... have you heard that?

[18:48:49] <Altreus> hethw: also, exists will only create in-between keys, but not the end key
[18:48:49] <Botje> Altreus: afaik yes, docker swarm lost to kubernetes/nomad/portainer
[18:49:18] <Botje> Altreus: docker-compose is for orchestration on a single node, swarm is for multiple nodes
[18:49:23] <hethw> Altreus, that's useful. what is in-between keys?
[18:49:53] <huf> $x{in}{between}{keys}{this_one_is_at_the_end}
[18:49:54] <Altreus> hethw: for example, exists $hr->{key} will not create key, but exists $hr->{deeply}->{nested}->{key} will create deeply and nested
[18:50:15] <krismatrix> Botje: ok. I guess I see the docker-compose files as creating two images. One for the web app (in my case a mojo app) and the other a postgresql app. In my case I also need to create a redis app. 
[18:50:30] <hethw> Altreus, thats my case. it creates both

[18:51:48] <Botje> krismatrix: so if you want to access the db you can contact the host "database" on the standard postgres port
[18:52:25] <Botje> krismatrix: for _your_ container, consider starting from the perl image and installing your dependencies with cpanm and/or a cpanfile
[18:53:07] <Altreus> note there are perl images that already have cpanm in, but this is worth doing as a learning exercise
[18:53:41] <hethw> Altreus, this is not a core package?
