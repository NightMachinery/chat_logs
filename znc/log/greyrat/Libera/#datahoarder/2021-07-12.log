[18:43:19] <unfinity> evilgohan2 you befriended a duck in 2.486 seconds! You have made friends with 169 ducks in #datahoarder.
[18:45:19] <evilgohan2> ARC has decided to stop working on my TV... or my receiver. Who the fuck knows? It stopped after working fine for months. No cause I can indentify. Spent almost 2 hours trying to troubleshoot it yesterday.
[18:45:58] <evilgohan2> So I can't get audio out from the native TV apps anymore except via optical... which isn't *bad* per se, but it's a significant reduction when Atmos worked 2 days ago.
[18:48:56] <imMute> HDMI is a scam perpetuated by the HDMI Committee (which happens to be full of HDMI-device manufacturers).   HDCP is even more so.
[18:49:35] <imMute> I say this as a computer engineer who was worked with HDMI and DP implementations.  DP is hard to implement but it's better in just about every way.
[18:50:38] <evilgohan2> DP is objectively better in every way.
[18:51:25] <imMute> The one place HDMI *might* be better is when using < HDMI 1.2 where the speeds are slow enough you don't need a SERDES on an FPGA.
[18:52:08] <imMute> But then that turns into a giant Fuck You when you need to do both < 1.2 and >= 1.2 because now you havee to use SERDES for the high speed but the low speed is a *bitch* to do now because you can't use the SERDES.
[18:52:35] <evilgohan2> I will admit that i do not know what "SERDES" s 
[18:52:37] <evilgohan2> is*
[18:52:50] <evilgohan2> oh!
[18:52:57] <evilgohan2> Well shit, I've never actually heard that acronym before.
[18:53:30] <imMute> Honestly I don't even know how I'd describe a SERDES to a non-EE.  XD
[18:53:31] <evilgohan2> serialization to compensate for limited i/o. Makes sense.
[18:53:45] <imMute> eh, that's not really the reason why.
[18:54:00] <evilgohan2> I am not an EE so that's fair
[18:54:04] <imMute> serial comms are able to go muuuuch faster than parallel, especially over distance.
[18:54:13] <imMute> using fewer pins/wires is just a bonus.
[18:56:33] <Allie> tbh everything should just have SDI on it and then i'd be happy
[18:58:04] <evilgohan2> It's all annoying. I just wanted to watch something last night, and I couldn't do so - quite literally - because ARC wasn't working.
[18:58:16] <evilgohan2> Well, I could've *watched* it I suppose... I just wouldn't have had audio lol
[18:58:34] <evilgohan2> Not without grabbing an optical cable anyway, which I do have, but what year is it again? lmao
[19:00:01] <evilgohan2> (Context: video in question had Dolby Vision... which is nice but a fucking pain. Plex App via FireTV doesn't support DV nor does the Receiver which means I can't use pass-thru from my HTPC. Accordingly, the only option was to use the Plex native App on the TV itself, or watch a video with some weird colors.)

[19:04:40] <Allie> :P 
[19:04:50] <Allie> there are no other video standards than 1080i50
[19:05:30] <imMute> GFY.
[19:05:33] <imMute> :P
[19:05:39] <Allie> well, besides 2160p50 but
[19:06:40] <imMute> I'm glad they got rid of interlace support after FHD.  Making a good deinterlacer in hardware is a PITA.
[19:06:52] <Allie> imMute: tbh the led walls i come across are still mostly DVI, although DP is replacing that
[19:07:01] <evilgohan2> 50.. ah, you PALadins...
[19:07:03] <evilgohan2> :P
[19:07:30] <Allie> but even then, if i'm making content for video walls it's coming out at a multiple of 1080p50 or 2160p50 tiles
[19:07:59] <imMute> Allie: Novastar?   I worked at the US company with the big blue D logo.  Using their player we could do custom resolutions that fix the display size exactly with no wasted bandwidth.
[19:08:25] <Allie> imMute: mostly analog way control since we're in the UK
[19:08:38] <imMute> Was really fun watching the Ross designers come up with something based on SDI that needed twice as much hardware because the display was ~200 lines taller than 1080 or 2160.
[19:08:59] <imMute> Ah, Analog Way.  I like them.  Never got to use their hardware that much, but they seemed to be working in the right direction.
