[00:14:07] <tinwhiskers> sorry, but I'm really struggling to follow anything you're trying to communicate.
[00:14:17] <tinwhiskers> what's your native language?
[00:14:20] <dfcnvt> Indeed -- I'll be elementary
[00:14:41] <dfcnvt> How does one have the confidence to master the universe?
[00:15:33] <tinwhiskers> kinda outside the scope of ##English I think :-)
[00:15:58] <tinwhiskers> but if you'd like help with your English go for it.
[00:17:01] <dfcnvt> But won't ##English has the master over a connection to language and how such word is tangible as real for one need to experience and can see for how word is fitting to the describe to one's own experience?
[00:17:06] *** Parts: Torr (~Torr@user/torr) ()
[00:17:34] <tinwhiskers> o.O
[00:18:33] <dfcnvt> Where would you point me to if given the opportunity that you believe I would fit well to such space or group?
[00:19:11] <tinwhiskers> Most people become confident at things by doing them - so get started at being a master of the universe and your confidence will come. (some people are overly confident without expereince too)
[00:19:24] <tinwhiskers> I really can't understand anything you're saying. What is your native language?
[00:20:58] <tinwhiskers> Maybe someone else can decipher your words and help you. Have a good day.
[00:21:28] <dfcnvt> Well, I'm deaf.  English is my native language...but the difference is my normative to people. I do not have any tangibility to what hearing people would utter and be considered as a most authentic English speaker.  I write english but not able to have any connection to English speaking people.
[00:21:48] <tinwhiskers> But you read, right?
[00:21:56] <dfcnvt> And that too.
[00:22:20] <dfcnvt> I'm not an expert -- that is clear.
[00:22:27] <giu> there is a "prosakart". this is a program to training. 
[00:23:22] <tinwhiskers> hrm. well, I dunno, but you can barely communicate in your native language, and I don't see how being deaf affects your word choice. I really can't help when your sentences make so little sense.
[00:24:30] <tinwhiskers> concentrate less on trying to use fancy words (badly) and more on making clear sentences.
[00:24:55] <dfcnvt> I'm sorry for not making sense -- that's a fault of my own.  I know that when I try to shine something that is within my own thoughts.  ...I didn't really think about the audience that is reading to what I am typing.  
[00:25:16] <tinwhiskers> ok. good luck.
[00:26:00] <dfcnvt> tinwhiskers: Thank you for pointing it out -- I did encounter to some people that didn't understand me well.  So, it's something I need to realize.
[00:26:39] <dfcnvt> I suppose, I want to be as free as I wanted to -- to speak whatever is on my mind.  I just don't like to be simplistic that doesn't allow me to breathe. 
[00:27:20] <dfcnvt> You're right -- I need to be clear and ensure there's nothing fancy in my writing as it may pose confusion.
[00:29:02] <tinwhiskers> it's not about being simplistic or dumbing down your words for us simple folk. You write English at about the level of a primary school kid. You need to dumb down your sentences for your own sake.

[21:09:44] <Bayes> what's the rational in pronouncing the first syllable of `binocular` as bə when `bilingual` is bī, and most of the words starting with `bi` (two) are bī
[21:11:15] <blkshp> Just is how English works. One pronunciation wins. Think "Ratio / Patio"

[21:11:35] <LjL> i'm guessing this is the reason, i don't *know* it, but binocular is bin+ocular, where bin comes from latin binus, while usual bi-, while related, has developed into a different prefix
[21:12:33] <blkshp> Ok that's a cleverer reason.
[21:13:24] <LjL> blkshp, patio is a borrowing from Spanish, ratio is a borrowing from Latin (though they both go back to Latin, but how/when a word enters the language tends to influence its pronunciation)
[21:13:48] <blkshp> To be honest it was a short video i watched earlier with sarcasm
[21:19:45] <Bayes> blkshp ratio / patio hehe that's a good one
[21:20:05] <Bayes> I do was thinking along the lines of what LjL said
[21:20:43] <Bayes>  from Latin bini ‘two together’ + oculus ‘eye’, on the pattern of ocular.
[21:20:53] <Bayes> that was clever LjL, thanks
[21:21:06] <Bayes> I just saw "bi" assumed it was bi+nocular :P
[21:23:09] <blkshp> Well you have a monocular as well so the mono and bino but be a thing! :P
[21:23:50] <LjL> i'm so bored today i could click through wiktionary etymologies until i reach proto-human

[21:30:17] <darsie> Wow, that was fast ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrienne_Lambert https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Member_states_of_the_United_Nations https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler
[21:30:47] <OMGOMG_> category links are obviously cheating
[21:34:00] <LjL> lol
[21:39:03] <huf> nz links to the battle of monte cassino and that links to hitler
[21:39:35] <huf> battle of el alamein does not, tough hitler is mentioned a lot
[21:39:42] <huf> weird game, I always thought
[21:42:21] <Panther> It's too easy.

[22:13:05] <blkshp> Hello. 
[22:13:40] <Kiman> Hi blkshp, I have some questions if you don't mind.
[22:14:14] <Kiman> Do I need to break the sentence? is it long? 
[22:14:14] <Kiman> "Up to this point, the project has printed and adapted the new materials to the country's contexts and translated them into German and Spanish, refreshed the knowledge of 5 old coaches, introduced and trained 8 new coaches from private sector’s centers on the new materials."
[22:14:33] <Kiman> Also, is the last part (starting with introduced) sounds fine? I didn't use "to" after "introduced"
[22:17:27] <blkshp> I would say yes. I would end after Spanish and add an "It has .." before "refeshed". Also, "...from the private..."
[22:17:43] <blkshp> But otherwise I think it's fine.
[22:20:56] <Kiman> "it has" only or "it has also refreshed ...."
