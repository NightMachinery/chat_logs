[00:55:25] <Crocodillian> I need a good game to play
[00:55:28] <Crocodillian> that is like talos
[00:57:58] *** Joins: TCZ (~tcz@91.150.178.124)
[01:01:19] <Renderwww> portal 1 or 2
[01:01:34] <Crocodillian> already played the shit out of those
[01:01:42] <Crocodillian> including many community chambers
[01:01:54] <Crocodillian> I should see if there are good mods for talos
[01:02:32] <Renderwww> gateways, it's portals 2d
[01:06:33] <Crocodillian> looks good, thank you!
[01:06:44] <Crocodillian> btw did you play the road to gehenna dlc
[01:06:47] <Crocodillian> it's amazing
[01:06:54] <Crocodillian> I'm doing yet another replay right now
[01:06:55] <Renderwww> I haven't even finished the base game
[01:07:11] <Crocodillian> it's even better than the base game
[01:07:16] <Crocodillian> which is amazing of course
[01:10:07] <Renderwww> I got stuck at some puzzle and then kinda forgot continue playing the game
[01:10:41] <Crocodillian> I recommend finishing it, the ending is amazing
[01:10:48] <Crocodillian> I won't tell you which one because you already know
[01:28:39] <T`aZ> im playing the elder scrolls

[01:30:36] <T`aZ> in addition to having your weapons deteriorating, you have to repair them, pay for the repair, and wait for the repair
[01:32:17] <T`aZ> and if you steal stuff and get caught, you get beaton down by the guards, no fun !

[09:35:46] <Renderwww> weapon deterioration, one of my least favorite game mechanics
[09:36:59] <Crocodillian> I liked it in morrowind because I'd get constant skill levels from using the armorer hammers
[09:40:55] <Crocodillian> same for the alchemy stuff
[09:41:03] <Crocodillian> make lots of potions, get lots of skill levels
[09:41:11] <ERROH> of all the reasonable stuff usa could do they... dump dst?
[09:41:28] <ERROH> what's next, universal healtcare?
[10:08:08] <Crocodillian> universal healthcare can be a bad thing depending on what that would mean
[10:11:07] <ERROH> hi Crocodillian 
[10:11:12] <ERROH> where are you from
[10:16:28] <Crocodillian> I'm in philadelphia right now
[10:17:16] <ERROH> yeah, ok
[10:17:59] <Crocodillian> I'm not saying I'm in favor of the US medical system
[10:18:12] <Crocodillian> you just have to be careful about not making it worse
[10:22:58] <Crocodillian> it's not a simple problem that is solved with just money
[10:23:07] <Crocodillian> money is the problem in many ways
[10:26:08] <Crocodillian> there have to be correct incentives and strategic allocations of resources
[10:26:24] <Carbonflux> ya i think part of the problem in the US is that we don't have a healthcare "system" but a "industry" so if you try to make it universal its complex, most of all if its coercive.

[11:02:50] <ERROH> this piece of software doesn't accept py 3.10, because it wants >3.2 lexicographically
[11:02:57] <jotham> sorry.  basically, libertarians are arguing with each other. half of them think putler is terrible because he locks people up and restricts liberty, the other half think he's great, because ???, all of them think the covid-19 restrictions are / were bad.  so the ones that think putler is a dick are telling the ones that love putler, that htey can't be anti medical fascism and be pro putler
[11:03:00] <jotham> fascism
[11:03:21] <Crocodillian> ERROH: you just have to encode some string or whatever
[11:03:37] <Crocodillian> or wait that's py2
[11:03:43] <jotham> i have no idea why westerners are pro putler
[11:03:51] <jotham> some media coup 
[11:04:38] <Crocodillian> russia is complicated, putin is not the sole power there
[11:04:54] <Crocodillian> he is the figurehead of the oligarchy
[11:05:03] <ERROH> i saw https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1504244620150063104 and i don't know what to think about it
[11:05:19] <ERROH> i know she's in the pro section of the mental institution, but still
[11:05:32] <Carbonflux> ya, Putin is a tool of greater powers, actually I think they may have broke him.
[11:05:34] <ERROH> there are people there who applaud that
[11:06:12] <ERROH> i don't think i know anyone who is pro putin except carbonflux
[11:06:18] <ERROH> for some value of "know"
[11:06:51] <ERROH> my sister is against migrants, she says we should be closing the borders
[11:06:56] <ERROH> but that's fear driven
[11:07:07] <jotham> Carbonflux: https://gregolear.substack.com/p/igor-sechin-russias-darth-vader?s=w worth a read if you give a shit about what you just typed
[11:07:21] <jotham> if you're just white-guy-reckons then, as you were
[11:07:34] * Carbonflux hands ERROH a document and whispers, thanks comrade.
[11:07:46] <ERROH> her daughter needs frequent medical attention and she's afraid migrants will kill our healthcare
[11:08:25] <jotham> fear for your children drives a lot of extreme choices
[11:08:37] <ERROH> couple years ago i read a book that claimed putin is not a person
[11:08:45] <ERROH> philosophically
[11:08:49] <jotham> a lot of anti-vax bullshit here was driven by mothers, midwives, alternative healers on the left
[11:08:57] <jotham> rather htan just the drum beat of american far right dipshit messaging
[11:09:21] <ERROH> like he's a person, but what we see as putin is a construct that's built out of many interlocked constantly struggling peoples
[11:09:35] <jotham> yeah okay that works
[11:10:22] <jotham> there is an idea that people like jesus and hitler are avatars of the the popular zeitgeist, like a way for community need to manifest itself through an individual
[11:10:30] <ERROH> that book ended grimly, saying that putin the person has no way out and will eventually be forced to go stalin style purge or a massive war win that will put the struggles at is
[11:11:08] <jotham> yeah i think that makes sense
[11:11:18] <jotham> that's why diplomats keep saying there is no way for him to 'save face' at this point
[11:11:24] <jotham> he's all in
[11:11:49] <ERROH> there's another person that longer has a way out or 'save face'
[11:11:52] <ERROH> zelenski
[11:12:12] <ERROH> he's a hero like we didn't see this century
[11:12:34] <ERROH> fucking macron is doing photo shoots pretending to be him like a fucking grouppi
[11:13:06] <jotham> a bit different to the politicians we've all grown used to that never say anything for fear of being destroyed in the media, act likeable enough, and enrich their supporters
[11:13:08] <Carbonflux> perhaps Ukraine saved a few nukes.
[11:13:28] <ERROH> now imagine zelenski telling him people that we're giving up crimea or republics or eu access after i told you all that we need to fight and we'll never surrender
[11:13:40] <jotham> yeah
[11:18:13] <ERROH> > perhaps Ukraine saved a few nukes.
[11:18:16] <Crocodillian> I believe the US could have solved the problem diplomatically in the past 8 years if they really wanted to
[11:18:25] <ERROH> that's exactly what ru is trying everyone to think
[11:19:01] <ERROH> the ukr is building a bomb, they have a bomb, they are collecting materiel to build a dirty bomb and set it off in moscow, they work and ultimate virus with the usa
[11:19:34] <ERROH> it's a tactic to spread as much fear/lies as possible and see what sticks and keep it spinning
[11:19:41] <jotham> wonder if Carbonflux actually gets a cheque from russia once a month
[11:19:46] <Crocodillian> yeah but we do the same thing
[11:20:11] <ERROH> p. sure he's doing it pro bono
[11:20:16] <ERROH> or pro dicko
[11:20:43] <jotham> sure Crocodillian, but i think all of us non americans are under no illusion that the US is not really a good guy
[11:20:46] <ERROH> he's getting tickets saying "one opportunity to suck supreme leaders cock, non-refundable"
[11:20:52] <jotham> so saying the US does what RU is doing isn't saying much
[11:21:23] <Crocodillian> good to know we're on the same page at least
[11:21:26] <jotham> maybe putin astral projects into carb's mind palace riding a bear
[11:21:29] <Crocodillian> and I do not defend russian fascism
[11:21:32] <jotham> and he's smitten
[11:22:50] <Crocodillian> russia is definitely partly to blame for their ukraine crisis, all the ukranians wanted in 2014 was the right to work in the EU and russia said no, of course the CIA was pushing the maidan thing too but still
[11:27:57] <T`aZ> ho god, here we go again
[11:29:01] <Carbonflux> no jotham, at first i got paid thru one of Jerry Epstein's funds, but now my cheque's comes from the Gates foundation.
[11:29:39] <jotham> the link i gave you draws a line between epstein and russia 
[11:29:43] <jotham> so that checks out
[11:30:15] <Crocodillian> ok let's not beat each other up over politics, there is enough of that elsewhere
[11:30:26] <MaNL> yeah, I always find that argument strange, its basically like saying "the US is bad (yes we all know) so we want more countries to also be bad"
[11:30:29] <Carbonflux> ya, he was KGB, his hedge fund was created by them and all the sex stuff was recorded and used for blackmail.
[11:30:56] <MaNL> like why would you want that, you want more bad in the world just so that you can thumb your nose as the US or what?
[11:30:59] *** MaNL is now known as MaNI
[11:31:13] <MaNI> part of this whole "politics as football" mentality I think
[11:31:19] <jotham> yep
[11:31:44] <jotham> in nz/au we find it weird how us citizens seem to celebrate their leaders
[11:31:48] <Carbonflux> which is why Hillary hates Putin so much, Epstein got Bill Clinton on video.
[11:31:53] <jotham> we literally are voting for the least shit from a bag of shit
[11:31:56] <jotham> there is no hero
[11:32:52] <Carbonflux> ya, MaNI, i often wonder if organized sport is mind training for it.

[11:34:06] <jotham> sounds like a kind of salad dressing
[11:46:17] <Crocodillian> Carbonflux: I was thinking of starting a game of fallout 3, with just the basic stability mods
[11:47:15] <jotham> i just played fallout 4 for the first time last year
[11:47:17] <jotham> was pretty good 
[11:49:18] <T`aZ> how is the first version ?
[11:49:36] <jotham> fallout 1?
[11:49:39] <jotham> fallout 2 was better iirc
[11:49:45] <jotham> i played them a lot a long time ago
[11:49:50] <T`aZ> yes fallout 1, haven't played any of the series yet
[11:50:00] <Crocodillian> I was recommended to start with 3
[11:50:05] <Crocodillian> vanilla first
[11:50:11] <jotham> 3 is the first all singing all dancing 3D one
[11:50:17] <jotham> was an early user of HDRI technology too
[11:53:00] <Carbonflux> Crocodillian, New Vegas might be the best version
[11:53:26] <Carbonflux> its a true classic, energy weapons are not nurfed and it gives you good back story.
[11:53:40] <Carbonflux> in terms of fallout 3
[11:55:25] <Carbonflux> NV starts a few years after 3, its basically the same game engine but with better mechanics and stuff
[11:55:45] <Crocodillian> ah cool
[12:10:11] <T`aZ> has node gone too far ? https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-NODEIPC-2426370

[12:58:50] <Crocodillian> well I just spent like an hour or two following this fo3 mod guide and it broke everything
[12:59:06] <Crocodillian> because I probably used the wrong guide, and it doesn't work for goty edition
[13:00:48] <Carbonflux> ya, i tend to try it first with vanilla then slowly add the mods, i actually have not had a lot of luck with the unofficial patches as well.
[13:01:01] <jotham> same problem with fallout 4
[13:01:07] <jotham> there are some mods that make the game much more usable
[13:01:11] <jotham> but it was a few days of madness
[13:01:14] <jotham> before i got them working
[13:01:20] <Carbonflux> mostly i just use content mods, like guns and clothes and stuff and a weather mod.
[13:01:37] <jotham> yeah weather/lighting/scenery mods for me
[13:01:57] <jotham> too bad the main fallout 4 campaign is shit
[13:02:05] <jotham> and none of the choices give me a wasteland i want to live in
[13:02:19] <jotham> well it's fun until the end where you have to choose between being basically different kinds of racists

[13:02:40] <jotham> I JUST WANT TO LIVE ON A RANCH WITH SOME GHOULS AND SOME OUTSIDERS

[15:07:14] <MaNI> never really got into fallout properly, always found turnbased combat games too tedious
[15:15:34] <jotham> that sucks
[15:15:40] <jotham> cause fallout isn't even a good example of the genre
[15:15:54] <jotham> and fallout 3 + aren't turn based tactical at all
[15:16:26] <jotham> MaNI: this is what a good turnbased tactical game looks like, and it's ridiculously engaging, like a weird organic puzzle https://store.steampowered.com/app/610370/Desperados_III/
[15:18:26] <MaNI> yeah, I don't necessarily hate the idea, its just (in my experience) very time consuming
[15:18:39] <MaNI> I have played a few over the years
[15:19:24] <jotham> that one i posted fucking enraged me
[15:19:29] <jotham> but when you crack the process of the scenario
[15:19:32] <jotham> it's so rewarding
[15:19:37] <jotham> it's more like a puzzle than a game
[15:19:42] <jotham> they've done an amazing job
[15:19:46] <jotham> but i did swear a shitload
[15:19:57] <jotham> but it's not like fallout that is basically just an rpg

[18:17:06] <Crocodillian> anyone getting a 500 from git push to github?
[18:21:03] <Crocodillian> yeah https://www.githubstatus.com/
[18:24:12] <hinst> "being alive is 100% fatal" current Earth population is 7B and historical population of all ppl ever lived is 107B therefore is actually under 100% fatal cause u cannot be sure all people who are currently alive will die
[18:27:07] <T`aZ> makes sense
[18:27:33] <Faux> You don't really need those numbers to say that; the fact that anyone is alive means we have no evidence that being alive is 100% fatal.
[18:27:51] <Faux> I thought there were very few dead; where'd you get that 107B number from?
[18:28:01] <Faux> I thought we were at reasonable risk of the living outnumbering the dead, which is fucking insane.
[18:28:34] <Faux> Apparently not.
[18:46:56] <Renderwww> what losers, how many of those 107B are still remembered, or even got a million youtube subscribers?!
[18:54:09] <MaNI> better kill more people to test the hypothesis
[18:56:10] <Renderwww> elvis already disproved it
[18:57:15] <Renderwww> hmm, born 1935. So it wouldn't be that surprising if he actually would still be alive
[18:57:30] <Renderwww> guess we need other proofs!
