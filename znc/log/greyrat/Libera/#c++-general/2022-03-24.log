[02:01:02] <johnny> ville, why do you use that site rather than the official one?
[02:01:37] <ville> did the c people finally manage to get one up?
[02:02:05] <johnny> i thought they did.. but maybe i'm thinking of the C++ one instead
[02:02:26] <ville> there isn't an official c++ one either. iso sanctionaed that is
[02:02:31] <ville> sanctioned
[02:02:45] <johnny> aha.. i assumed open-std was it, but it's not then :)
[02:03:02] <johnny> http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2934.pdf for example this is what i thought was official, but i guess i didn't look close enough

[02:03:16] <johnny> aha
[02:03:37] <ville> i don't use the pdfs because linking to specific parts in them may or may not work for people
[02:04:03] <johnny> indeed.. it's too bad that folks can just publish in pdf at all

[05:35:28] <Guest19> Hello, in above snippet, does the copy to T happen under lock as well?
[05:36:16] <PJBoy> yes, return values are initialised before any destructors execute
[05:36:44] <PJBoy> or you could say dtors don't execute until after the semicolon closing the return statement
[05:38:38] <Guest19> so you mean sequence is T = memberVariable; ~mylock;

[19:00:11] <CarloWood> You may assume the next bit is a zero - if it isn't then failure is ok.

[19:01:49] <nq> well, I can't say about "fastest", but I'd just use a 0b1000000 mask, & it with the number, and shift the number to the left, while counting

[20:09:25] <CarloWood> I'd like a flexible way of transforming the input string however.
[20:09:30] <Alipha> PJBoy: weird. why does this last one appear to be "less efficient"? https://godbolt.org/z/P5f5xvaqb
[20:10:02] <PJBoy> because division of negative numbers isn't the same as bitshift right of negative numbers
[20:11:04] <PJBoy> so in general, division of signed ints is slower even when by a constant power of 2
[20:11:04] <CarloWood> One way could be to pass two strings that just map UTF8 characters. But I think it is slightly more complex than that. Some characters you want to be escaped (ie, a space with %20). Hmm
[20:13:04] <CarloWood> I think I'll keep the escapes the same? Just always replace escaped characters with %HH where HH is their hex code. An escape multi-byte glyph would just look like: %e3%8f%a3 or something.
[20:14:03] <PJBoy> so it looks like it's checking if the int was negative, and if so it does ceiling division -> floor division trick
[20:14:24] <PJBoy> where ceil_div(n, d) = floor_div(n + d-1, d)
[20:14:38] <PJBoy> and then it can do the floor division via bitshift
[20:14:39] <rpav> room_div
[20:14:46] <CarloWood> There isn't really a reason to escape utf8 glyphs, because chars > 127 are always legal in filenames. But the SO question wants it to be reversible.  Thus any utf glyph that replaces some illegal char must itself also be escaped then.
[20:16:46] <Alipha> PJBoy: using unsigned instead of int makes the last use 1 fewer instructions than the first 2: https://godbolt.org/z/PrTeTE484
[20:17:55] <PJBoy> now that one surprises me
[20:19:53] <PJBoy> I guess that `i / 0x20 * 3 / 0x80` is worse than `i * 3 / 0x80`

[21:47:10] <meator> Hello. I have two constructors. They do two things: they set a private std::string and then do some work. Both do the same work, they only use different methods to initialize the string (one uses rvalue reference and one uses a const reference for copying). Is this the right way to do it: https://godbolt.org/z/4rK98Ms3j ?
[21:48:44] <Gvidon> No. You don't need to do "std::string(str)", you can just use "str" in the first constructor. And for the second one, you need to move str explicitly
[21:49:14] <Gvidon> Oh, shit. I misread the first one
[21:49:40] <Gvidon> It's ok. You just need to add std::move to the second one
[21:51:44] <Gvidon> Or you can go with just one templated constructor, universal references and std::forward
[21:52:31] <Gvidon> Personally, I find it overcomplicated, but some people like it this way
[21:53:17] <meator> Why std::move? std::string && is being passed to std::string, so it should pick basic_string( basic_string&& other ) noexcept constructor.
[21:54:48] <Alipha> meator: an rvalue reference only affects what you can initialize the reference with. After initialization, the reference is an lvalue
[21:55:19] <Alipha> Oh
[21:55:56] <Alipha> Right, yes. You need std::move

[22:01:01] <meator> Hmmm.
[22:01:05] <meator> Ok.
[22:01:11] <meator> I'll use std::move then.
[22:01:39] <Alipha> meator: but, really, truly, seriously, don't bother with two different constructors. Just `mytest(std::string str) : mystr(std::move(str)) {}`
[22:04:52] <meator> Is const std::string & str in the first constructor really beneficial? It's going to make copies anyway, so is the first constructor the equivalent of mytest(std::string str) : mytest(str)?
[22:05:31] *** Quits: mint (~mint@85.174.200.135) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:07:43] <Gvidon> No. If you add std::move like Alipha did and it will be more or less similar but still not the same thing. Technically it will have to call an additional move constructor, but it shouldn't make much difference
[22:09:23] <Gvidon> "mytest(std::string& str): mystr(str)" -- one copy constructor
[22:09:48] <Gvidon> "mytest(std::string str): mystr(std::move(str))" -- one copy constructor and one move constructor
[22:10:08] <Gvidon> "mytest(std::string str): mystr(str)" -- two copy constructors
[22:11:04] <Gvidon> Unless you move into it. Oh, well, you get the idea
[22:12:58] <CarloWood> Alipha, for extra magic - I made it return 1 when the bytes starts with 11111 because then it isn't UTF8 ;).
[22:13:03] <CarloWood>   // The length of a glyph is determined by the first byte.
[22:13:03] <CarloWood>   // This returns 2 for 110xxxxx, 3 for 1110xxxx, 4 for 11110xxx and 1 otherwise.
[22:13:03] <CarloWood>   int glen = 1 + ((14933 >> ((x >> 3) & 31) * 2 - 48) & 3);
[22:13:36] <CarloWood> Also got rid of the UL - to make sure nobody will understand it.
[22:14:53] <CarloWood> In fact, 10xxxxxx also isn't UTF8 when it is the first byte - but that already returns 1.
[22:16:13] <meator> Well that won't work. mytest(std::string str) : mytest(str) is invalid. I have tried mytest(std::string str) : mytest(move(str)), but that is ambiguous for some reason: https://godbolt.org/z/xh39b6G8v
[22:16:18] <meator> Why?
[22:16:43] <Gvidon> Remove the second one
[22:17:43] <Gvidon> CarloWood: Neat. Completely unreadable but no branching
[22:17:55] <meator> But then the first constructor wouldn't have where to delegate.
[22:18:35] <CarloWood> meator: that were a LOT of errors lol... https://godbolt.org/z/ao9bqanan
[22:18:37] <Gvidon> meator: Right. Do "mytest(std::string str) : mystr(std::move(str))"

[23:02:27] <Raziel> Alipha, it got eaten by a grue

[23:03:55] <Raziel> Alipha, well, there's no const constructors so it errors
[23:04:06] <Raziel> I mean, constructors taking a const ref

[23:04:42] <Alipha> meator: don't use firefox :-(
[23:04:58] <Alipha> really, don't use wandbox
[23:05:17] <Friithian> hey so it isn't just me having issues with wandbox
[23:05:20] <Raziel> it still works fine on my firefox (developer edition, 99.0b7)
[23:05:30] <Raziel> but I have heard lots of people say it's broken for them over the past week or so, yeah
[23:05:43] <Gvidon> Between firefox and some stupid broken site I will always chose Firefox

[23:06:02] <Raziel> Gvidon, same :p
[23:06:15] <meator> Oh. This is my first time using godbolt, I didn't know about browser issues.
[23:06:32] <Gvidon> meator: We aren't talking about godbolt

[23:08:47] <ville> Alipha: recommending against firefox is horrible. don't know how old you are but you don't want a broweser rendering kit monoculture. again
[23:09:15] <Raziel> specially not one driven by google, of all corpos
[23:09:19] <Raziel> lol

[23:10:12] <ville> well yes it's next-level that it's one of the leading surveilance corporations behind it, but the most important thing is not ending up in a monoculture even if it was firefox
[23:10:17] <Alipha> ville: hence "really, don't use wandbox" :-)

[23:12:42] <Alipha> meator: alternatively, you could put your constructor code body into a private helper function and call the helper function from both constructors.

[23:16:09] <meator> So the first snippet I posted here was more or less correct, but the second constructor was missing std::move().
[23:16:18] <meator> I think this answers my question.
[23:16:21] <meator> Thanks!
[23:16:35] <Alipha> meator: https://godbolt.org/z/PnWEoM8Ga
[23:19:17] <Alipha> the middle can be improved with concepts (c++20): https://godbolt.org/z/8j437vfsG ... changed `template<typename String>` to `template<std::convertible_to<std::string> String>`
[23:20:13] <Alipha> (or with std::enable_if ugliness prior to c++20)

[23:25:34] <meator> Alipha: Interesting. As you have said, the usage of templates in the middle one means that anything can get there, which might be problematic. But it's interesting. I'll have to read about std::forward.
