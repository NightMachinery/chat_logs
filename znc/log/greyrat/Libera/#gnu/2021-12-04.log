[02:44:46] <bill-auger> i can not understand the concern for privacy in a public chat - it seems like going shopping at a large public marketplace, but expecting that no one may know that you were there
[02:45:38] <bill-auger> and expecting that it is the store owner's responsibility, to emsure that no one finds out that you were there
[02:47:02] <bill-auger> in my experience, ppl do not ordinarily complain about lack of privacy while shopping

[03:42:12] <jkk> why accept any money from such sources?
[03:42:13] <jkk> ;)
[03:43:02] <jkk> and they are educated people they would not simply take any one word - it would all have been done in writing
[03:43:08] <jkk> with them present
[03:43:37] <jkk> even it it was to register and or transfer freenode as a copyright
[03:43:42] <PantelicGR> They had sponsors for running Freenode live and pc-donors for servers.
[03:43:48] <jkk> yes exactly
[03:44:26] <PantelicGR> They trusted Christel and were misled by her.
[03:44:32] <jkk> o no
[03:44:36] <PantelicGR> She was the head of the staff at the time.

[03:44:59] <jkk> they could register freenode themself and accept 'donations'
[03:45:05] <jkk> which is how it is done
[03:45:08] <PantelicGR> Are you trying to tell me that you haven't believed ANY lies in your whole life?
[03:45:14] <PantelicGR> Are you god or something?
[03:45:33] <jkk> PantelicGR, if it was a criminal case they would be jailed
[03:45:44] <jkk> as on balance of probabilities it is improbable
[03:46:08] <PantelicGR> I'm no judge and I cannot speak as if I was one.
[03:46:38] <jkk> however they were not company directors - the reason freenode was not registered by them - it places duties of directorship on directors
[03:46:53] <PantelicGR> People believe lies all the time.
[03:46:54] <jkk> and if proven that they have acted to the contrary there are some penalties
[03:47:28] <jkk> Private Internet Access (PIA) is a personal VPN service. In 2018, former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpelès was named chief technology officer of PIA's parent company, London Trust Media - he was well know to all staffers
[03:48:01] <jkk> yes still none of them have quit andrew lee freenode at the time or publicly opposed such an addition
[03:48:50] <PantelicGR> They left when Andrew Lee was trying to takeover Freenode.
[03:49:29] <jkk> <jkk> yes still none of them have quit andrew lee freenode at the time or publicly opposed such an addition
[03:49:50] <jkk> also when PIA was sold to a company that is know front for intel agencies - also silence
[03:50:13] <PantelicGR> Then it was became apparent that they had no other choice but to create a new network with *NEW* collective ownership.
[03:50:44] <jkk> only when fake korean prince got out of hand they simply make a same thing without him
[03:50:50] <PantelicGR> And abandon head of staff ownership which was misused by Christel.
[03:50:51] <jkk> *made
[03:50:54] <jkk> no
[03:51:07] <jkk> <jkk> and if proven that they have acted to the contrary there are some penalties

[03:51:07] <jkk> <jkk> yes still none of them have quit andrew lee freenode at the time or publicly opposed such an addition
[03:51:27] <jkk> they were silent got ages about ongoing in your face nonsense
[03:51:33] <jkk> for ages
[03:52:02] <PantelicGR> We are going in circles here.
[03:52:04] <akspecs> i mean, sometimes it takes time to organize such a big change
[03:52:31] <jkk> they wanted to inflict maximum possible reputational  damage to irc as a place for free software talks and dev
[03:52:38] <PantelicGR> jkk: What would you do if others lied to you and mislead you?
[03:52:38] <akspecs> imagine being mistreated as a worker -- or working for someone who you feel doesn't have your best interest at heart
[03:52:57] <jkk> PantelicGR, they did not knew who Mark is?
[03:53:06] <jkk> is that is what you saying?
[03:53:34] <akspecs> it takes a moment to talk amongst yourselves (as workers), and unionize -- go on strike -- or start a new network
[03:53:36] <PantelicGR> I don't know such a detail.
[03:54:07] <jkk> really, he happen to host mtgox channel on a freenode and was involved in a large scale scams
[03:54:19] <PantelicGR> And I agree with akspecs. It takes time to find out what's going on and respond *properly*.
[03:54:28] <jkk> years for sure
[03:54:42] <akspecs> jkk:  tl;dr therefore you think #gnu sould have gone via hosting their own network?
[03:54:50] <jkk> could not should
[03:56:23] <akspecs> curious, are there before and after numbers in terms of #freenode users vs #libera users, now?
[03:56:45] <jkk> akspecs, freenode was simply a bunch of servers - some donated, and so called mostly anon volunteers all run it as a group, christel was not some ceo or an owner
[03:56:58] <jkk> none of them owned freenode as such
