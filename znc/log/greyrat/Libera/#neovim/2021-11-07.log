[00:06:41] <dundargoc[m]> jamessan[m]: What are these no-name frameworks you keep using.
[00:07:17] <jamessan[m]> What's the other one I use?
[00:07:29] <dundargoc[m]> git
[00:07:49] <jamessan[m]> ah, I thought you were going to say Debian :)
[00:08:10] <dundargoc[m]> Nah, debian is legit :)
[00:09:08] <dundargoc[m]> What flavor(?) are you using? Stable/unatable?
[00:09:28] <jamessan[m]> unstable... gotta dog food the packages I maintain
[00:10:20] <dundargoc[m]> Have heard that "unstable" is badly named since it doesn't tend to be unstable, but havent tried it myself
[00:11:31] <jamessan[m]> It certainly has periods of rockiness.  Just gotta pay attention to things when you need to use `apt full-upgrade` instead of plain `apt upgrade`
[00:12:21] <mcepl[m]> I know, gentlemen don't argue about defaults, but still, shouldn't 'directory' default to $XDGCACHEHOME/nvim instead of $XDGDATAHOME/nvim? Swapfiles are nothing worthy of backuping, are they?
[00:13:06] <dundargoc[m]> Ehhhhh, isn't the point of swapfiles that they are backed up?
[00:13:18] <jamessan[m]> swapfiles are transient
[00:13:42] <jamessan[m]> They're just to help if nvim or your computer crash
[00:14:31] <jamessan[m]> Whether they should be backed up depends on how long you get back to editing the file that the swapfile is storing info about, I guess :)
[00:15:12] <bfredl> well, some people use 'undofile' as VCS apparently. (as was apparent when we broke undofile compat with vim)
[00:15:25] <dundargoc[m]> bfredl: Lmfao no way

[00:17:54] <dundargoc[m]> gpanders I take back what I said, suddenly using git on home doesn't sound too bad.
[00:17:59] <sunjonSenghanBri> you should raise your hand to your brow and feint now
[00:18:25] <dundargoc[m]> sunjonSenghanBri: You're one of them, aren't you?

[00:19:08] <sunjonSenghanBri> undo is a powerful tool. no two ways about it
[00:19:35] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's not a git alternative
[00:20:00] <dundargoc[m]> Hottest of hot takes
[00:20:37] <mcepl[m]> going through my old $VIMRC and wondering: is `syntax on` still the thing? That should be default, isn't it? (cannot find in :he syntax anything enlightening).
[00:21:05] <bfredl> dundargoc[m]: this is the kind of conversation you get on the issue tracker, yes
[00:21:21] <dundargoc[m]> 🤢
[00:21:28] <jamessan[m]> mcepl[m]: If you want compatibility with Vim, yes.  Otherwise, no need.
[00:22:04] <bfredl> dundargoc[m]: some potential users have to _let you know_ that they are not using our softwares anymore, you know
[00:22:15] <mcepl[m]> jamessan: just fighting with my denial ... my configuration (still in `~/.vim`) is **REALLY** not compatible with vim anymore.
[00:22:35] <dundargoc[m]> bfredl: And I thought I was dramatic, jeez
[00:22:35] <tk> I use undofiles and backupfiles for VCS of random shit
[00:22:50] <tk> but my backupfiles are individually named

[00:23:08] <bfredl> dundargoc[m]: welcome to the open source game :]
[00:23:34] <tk> I don't use them intentionally
[00:23:47] <tk> it's not like I have a workflow around opening backup files etc
[00:24:22] <tk> but for undofiles, well... I don't usually NEED to go very far back, but it's nice to have history across sessions because I'm one of those people who never learned to suspend vim to background
[00:24:37] <tk> I close and reopen every minute sometimes
[00:24:46] <tk> it's why I appreciate neovim's marginally faster startup time
[00:25:30] <bfredl> everytime you restart nvim needs to reparse the tree-sitter trees tho. which is killing the rainforests.

[09:12:38] <hendry> how do i get neovim to format my javascript? do I need setup a eslintrc or something?
[09:14:22] <dumbdemic[m]> You can do that with lsp using null-ls or efm etc
[09:16:59] *** Joins: guido (~guido@host-87-10-17-250.retail.telecomitalia.it)
[09:21:10] <dumbdemic[m]> Or you can simply setup tsserver in lsp, javascript formatting is working with `:lua vim.lsp.buf.formatting()`
[09:29:12] <mjlbach[m]> eslintd is also in lspconfig now
[09:29:39] <mjlbach[m]> hendry: generally I’m not a good person to ask js specific questions re: Twitter, tsserver doesn’t always provide auto imports
[09:32:23] <hendry> mjlbach[m]: i noticed fundamentally when you start using require() as to get running code, completion stops working https://s.natalian.org/2021-11-07/axios-nvim-lsp.mp4
[09:34:30] <hendry> mjlbach[m]: tbh vs code has the same issue as quay.io/nvim-lsp/try.nvim:nightly-typescript ... so perhaps ignore me
[09:34:59] <mjlbach[m]> I don't think you can compelete fields or arguments that would be passed to a closure...
[09:35:08] <mjlbach[m]> s/a/an/, s/closure/anonymous function/
[09:35:15] <mjlbach[m]> Sorry I don't know what Js calls it
[09:35:56] <hendry> mjlbach[m]: when it's not as a closure (not sure what it's called either), and i'm using require(), it also doesn't work
[09:36:15] <mjlbach[m]> You usually can't complete function arguments
[09:36:19] <mjlbach[m]> s/arguments/argument fields/
[09:36:29] <mjlbach[m]> even if you declare the types
[09:36:58] <hendry> mjlbach[m]: why? i'm honestly shocked how weird the JS environment is. How is this productive, haha
[09:37:10] <mjlbach[m]> Does it in vscode?
[09:37:16] <mjlbach[m]> Should be the same request
[09:37:53] <hendry> afaict vscode and quay.io/nvim-lsp/try.nvim:nightly-typescript has the same behaviour, so I guess I should be asking questions to the people who maintain tsserver perhaps?
[09:38:00] <mjlbach[m]> yes
[09:38:13] <mjlbach[m]> tsserver is maintained by microsoft :) 
[09:38:29] <mjlbach[m]> we are just showing you what it provides, we ask for a completion at a point and it gives us a list
[09:38:42] <mjlbach[m]> so if you're getting missing completions, 9.9 times/10 it's on the server
[09:38:48] <mjlbach[m]> at least nowadays
[09:39:11] <mjlbach[m]> unless you're typing a ton of emojis in your code then you can @ me and ask me why I didn't do multibyte support right the first time

[21:21:33] <hab[m]> This might be it, I started having issues with the placeholders themselves, where tab wouldn't work..
[21:21:42] <hab[m]> I'll look into it, thank you
[21:22:32] <johnbon> I'm trying to use nvim-lspconfig to connect to sbt server (for Scala files), this doesn't have a default config, so I put the section here (I changed the command to just `sbt`) in my init config: https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/ADVANCED_README.md#example-custom-config
[21:22:33] <johnbon> When I run :LspInfo in one of the buffer containing a Scala file in my project, I see the that root directory has been correctly found, but it's written that there are no clients attached. Do I need to attach the client myself? I saw in the documentation that there is a   vim.lsp.start_client command, but I'm not sure what to pass it.
[21:22:33] <johnbon> In the end I would just like to have highlighting for the compilation errors returned by `sbt compile`
[21:23:11] <mjlbach[m]> No, it should just start for you if it's configured correctly
[21:23:37] <mjlbach[m]> it needs to detect a root because currently lspconfig assumes you are in a "project" so we know what to attach the current language server to
[21:24:12] <johnbon> indeed I'm in a project, I want `sbt` to run at the root of it

[21:24:24] <johnbon> in LspInfo it's written: "cmd: sbt"   "cmd is executable: true" and "autostart: true"
[21:24:41] <johnbon> maybe I need to run the compile command manually?

[21:31:07] <mjlbach[m]> Our client currently only supports communicating with servers it launches directly over stdio
[21:31:11] <mjlbach[m]> this is most servers
[21:31:27] <mjlbach[m]> godot is unique, in that it only supports tcp/websockets (IIRC)
[21:31:36] <mjlbach[m]> seems like sdt uses named sockets, for which you could use netcat

[21:54:26] <kylo252[m]> not sure what's up with after trying to read the source code, it might be that they're not advertising it as a formatter: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-html-languageservice/blob/94e5422c7fe92d9a507533b4fc3a08277cf39733/src/htmlLanguageTypes.ts#L238

[21:55:24] <mjlbach[m]> Seems like it

[21:56:01] <dundargoc[m]> mjlbach[m]: You mean you wouldn't file a bug report?
[21:56:09] <mjlbach[m]> You should still file it
[21:56:17] <dundargoc[m]> ?
[21:56:20] <kylo252[m]> the only tricky thing is that I had to use `on_attach` to force it on, so I guess it's not an option to make a default in lspconfig
[21:56:25] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah
[21:56:26] <mjlbach[m]> I mean
[21:56:37] <mjlbach[m]> We can at least document it
[21:57:11] <mjlbach[m]> and people are free to make an "html-ls.nvim" that contains workarounds
[21:57:44] <kylo252[m]> any emacs users? that's how I found out about the `html.format.enable`, but other than I don't see anything specific
[21:58:12] <kylo252[m]> there's also the problem that we're using a hacked-together server from a service. so I'm not sure if that matters

[21:59:28] <kylo252[m]> mjlbach[m]: it's probably shit anyway, they're using an external library to do the formatting, something called beautify: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-html-languageservice/tree/main/src/beautify
[21:59:32] <dundargoc[m]> Go for it, I believe in you

[22:00:24] <mjlbach[m]> kickstart, try, and babelfish are also pretty low-maintence (the latter from lack of use)

[23:41:56] <bard[m]> I'm having a problem where when I open two files over scp with -O, only one of them appears. If I then manually open the second file and save to a session file, then restoring the session gives some errors.... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/8de7fad739354341fca0a8dd0fef9d8c70b62052)
[23:42:52] <bard[m]> Also, trying to do the same from another user on the same machine fails in a different way. Seemingly netrw is broken. In that case I get these errors:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/2bd5d3e219e4fd04a3a550a2c83235a41c06fd01)
[23:44:36] <jamessan[m]> > Seemingly netrw is broken
[23:44:36] <jamessan[m]> Very likely

[23:45:55] <bard[m]> jamessan[m]: Any suggestions for fixing it? Would I replace a file somewhere? Or reinstall the neovim package maybe?

[23:48:46] <halikular> Look like Windows locale UTF-8 option didn't work.
[23:49:35] <bfredl> what's wrong with worldwide language support?
[23:49:57] <halikular> What do you mean?

[23:50:30] <bfredl> I just found the discription of UTF-8 funny :)
[23:50:36] <bfredl> welcome to the wide world
[23:51:00] <halikular> indeed
[23:51:07] <jamessan[m]> bard: if you're actually using the "net" part, I dunno. If you're just using the file explorer part, maybe dirvish
[23:52:05] <bard[m]> Using the "net" part, yeah. Opening remote files.
[23:53:46] <jamessan[m]> sshfs?
[23:54:34] <sunjonSenghanBri> bfredl:matrix.org: are the `g:terminal_color_*` settings only for _real_ gui's now?
[23:55:31] <sunjonSenghanBri> I mean, they override the auto-inherit. But are there cases (in terminal land) that auto-inherit doesn't work?
[23:56:13] <bfredl> you can use them in TUI ("fake gui") as well.
[23:56:30] <bfredl> but you don't need it, as you can just as well configure your terminal emulator properly :]
[23:56:59] <bard[m]> jamessan: I use sshfs for some things, but IMO it's not a valid replacement for opening files with scp://. For example I might want a couple directories mounted long-term with sshfs, but scp:// is quick for files in various places on various machines, and it's working fine on my other box. So, really I'd prefer a fix for the errors rather than a suggestion of using other stuff.
[23:57:55] <bard[m]> sshfs is great for something like playing remote video files, but I will almost never rely on it for editing files since most editors support remote editing and I find that makes a bit more sense to me.
[23:59:18] <sunjonSenghanBri> bfredl:matrix.org: for some reason I was unaware that inheritance worked (I had them set in my colorscheme for some time), and finished an old script I found today...
[23:59:24] <sunjonSenghanBri> that now turns out to be useless :]
