[07:14:53] <mfiano> Hello again.
[07:17:14] <mfiano> I would like to get a better idea of what people are using Raku for these days. I haven't looked at Perl in about 20 years, and historically it has been mostly used for text processing and cgi scripts (which I suppose is a subset of the former). I am told Raku is more suitable to other tasks, and while I know it is a general-purpose language, I'm still curious what members of the community are
[07:17:16] <mfiano> actually using it for these days, outside of text processing, parsers, and the like.

[08:02:02] <moon-child> https://6guts.wordpress.com/2021/09/29/the-new-moarvm-dispatch-mechanism-is-here/  mentions its use in 'Agrammon, an application calculating farming emissions'
[08:03:43] <mfiano> Wonder how it'd do for declarative, data-driven tasks, like a lot of traditional AI. Probably best to stick to CL for that ;)
[08:24:37] <moon-child> there are no symbols, which is a shame.  But you can do interning yourself.  Beyond that you're probably mostly fine

[11:15:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> what are "symbols"?
[11:17:03] <moon-child> a symbol is an identifier.  Given two symbols you may ask whether they identify the same thing (i.e. compare them).  That's it
[11:17:21] <moon-child> frequently symbols are used to represent variable and function names in code.  Raku uses strings instead
[11:17:47] <mfiano> THe thing that a string maps to in a symbol table of a compiler. Lisp just exposes these as a primitive.
[11:18:04] <moon-child> notably symbols are interned, where strings are not.  So you can use === to compare them in constant time
[11:25:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I don't quite get the use case
[11:33:33] <moon-child> @Nemokosch you can think of it a bit like the dynamic typing version of enums

[11:36:03] <monochromec> 	Hi! Who's the right person to contact as a dev advocate or community liaison for Raku?
[11:43:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> moon-child: how is it useful to make it compile time, then?
[11:44:43] <moon-child> how not?
[11:47:09] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I mean, could you give an example for using it compile time? lol
[11:48:06] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> because there are constants in Raku, it's just a matter of implementation to make them evaluated compile-time in a switch-like scenario
[11:48:36] <moon-child> hm, I may have misinterpreted your initial question.  Can you rephrase/elaborate?
[11:51:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> No, not really
[11:52:30] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I genuinely don't get what these "symbols" are when it really sounds like they are just typeless constants
[11:52:46] <moon-child> 'typeless constants' exactly
[11:52:46] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> like IterationEnd for the matter
[11:53:00] <moon-child> but you do not need to explicitly declare them.  You can just use them as you see fit
[11:53:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> What does that mean? How would either a person or a compiler know they are something?
[11:54:17] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> It sounds more weird than useful, to not need to declare them
[11:54:19] <moon-child> they are not _anything_, by themselves.  The only way to 'get' any information out of a symbol is to compare it to another symbol and see if they are the same
[11:55:22] <mfiano> Are you sure about that?
[11:55:35] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> This sounds like IterationEnd but without declaration...
[11:56:03] <mfiano> They are objects, like everything else in CL. They have 5 fields, such as the value bound to it.
[11:56:10] <moon-child> mfiano: sure, in cl you have symbol-package and symbol-name and such, but those are incidental, not The Point
[11:56:19] <mfiano> Fair enough.
[11:56:40] <moon-child> and, talking about symbols as an abstract concept, not specifically as in cl
[11:57:04] <mfiano> Ok, then pick up any compiler theory book and be done with it.
[11:57:09] <mfiano> They are an integral part
[11:57:49] <moon-child> fair enough

[15:04:41] <mfiano> I won't "lol" either. shell scripting is the worst, and I say that with 30 years of still banging my head over trivial tasks
[15:07:26] <mfiano> I haven't tried raku out yet, been mostly reading still. i would definitely consider replacing some sh and lisp scripts with something like that. my only concern would be warmup time; most shell scripts are short-lived processes so waiting 20 seconds for it to even begin would be worthless.

[15:10:23] <RaycatWhoDat> Oh, yeah. Raku can definitely chug if you start using a bunch of the arcane magick constructs in the language but, for 95% of what you're doing, Raku is ready to go in like 0.5 secs.
[15:10:51] <RaycatWhoDat> Give or take. I haven't measured a damn thing.
[15:11:14] <tbrowder> and when i need a serious bash prog, i use raku instead
[15:11:31] <mfiano> Are there any interesting programs written in Raku? Like something that you might see on HN or something?
[15:11:42] <tbrowder> and i use raku for cgi progs, too
[15:12:03] <RaycatWhoDat> The biggest one *might* be Red
[15:12:13] <RaycatWhoDat> I need to double-check, one second
[15:12:57] <tbrowder> find jnthn's lecture on his BIG prog for one of the European gov agencies
[15:13:35] <tbrowder> now that's heavy duty use of Raku
[15:13:47] <RaycatWhoDat> Oh, yeah, yeah

[15:15:03] <RaycatWhoDat> tbrowder: He's done so many, I've forgotten which year it was. Do you remember?
[15:16:06] <tbrowder> er, no, but i'll see if i can duckduckgo it...

[16:01:47] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @mfiano: re: "what is Raku being used for" -- I use Raku to make Conversational Agents (CA) for computational workflows. At this point most of them are not CAs, but "single-line interpreters", but I do use them to generate Data Science or Machine Learning workflows for different languages: Mathematica, Python, R.
[16:05:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @mifiano This recent presentation of mine, "Raku for prediction", goes into more details: https://conf.raku.org/talk/157 .
[16:06:28] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> I wrote a simple password manager in raku which I use daily. Also writing a "network jukebox", for controlling speakers remotely via a web interface with a shared queue and music library from multiple users. Once upon a time, I did some video game modding using raku (replacing sounds, textures, etc).

[17:08:52] <perryprog> looks like discord-raku-bot is having a moment
[17:08:54] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> The integration tests don't work any longer since the format changed. Haven't really thought about how to fix it.

[17:09:15] <perryprog> its*
[17:10:02] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> looks like it's confused when someone is at-mentioned on the discord side
[17:10:06] <perryprog> yeah
[17:11:19] <MasterDuke> gfldex maybe?
[17:12:01] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> I dropped a note in discord's <#538407879980482562>
[17:12:20] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> ha, and that got formatted weirdly too, naturally. the "general" channel is what I meant.
[17:12:42] <perryprog> see if you just used irc we wouldn't have these problems ;)
[17:13:04] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> my computer running my IRC client died
[17:13:15] <perryprog> well, heck
[17:13:19] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> so I'm using discord as my bouncer 🙂
[17:13:39] * gfldex is looking into it
[17:13:50] <perryprog> Thanks!
[17:13:51] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232>  '@' ~ discord-user(329084082162106371.Str)  What is Go used for in your "saiph" package? (I am too lazy to read and comprehend the code...)
[17:14:51] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> the golang code is just a parallel implementation to dump one of the encrypted files. still requires the password, just helped make sure I wasn't silently using the library wrong
[17:15:45] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> (originally the code was using gpg so you could just `gpg -d somefile` as a way to peek into it, so I wanted to keep that)

[17:21:15] <perryprog> just since it shouldn't matter for a bridge, IMO
[17:22:28] <gfldex> The bridge has to translate stuff that IRC doesn't understand. Discord is using `@ ~ 'some stuff here'` quite heavily.

[17:22:42] <perryprog> Oh, I mean in username tags
[17:22:58] <gfldex> That would be very confusing.
[17:23:04] <perryprog> As in make <@123> into @person instead of @person#456
[17:25:59] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @avuserow#1203 Do I have to install `xclip` or I can skip it?
[17:26:07] <gfldex> Quite in contrast to IRC, usernames are not uniqe on Discord. There are also per-server usernames.
[17:27:01] <perryprog> I'm aware. There's just no need to have the #1234 portion for an IRC bridge of this scale.
[17:27:06] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> You can skip it. It's used in a few commands but if you just want to echo things to stdout, you're fine
[17:27:07] <perryprog> (In my opinion, of course :))
[17:27:30] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> I used it have it on a headless server with no X11 and it worked fine.
[17:28:02] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Installing it now it  now with `brew`...
[17:28:14] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Username#Discriminator should be good enough
[17:28:22] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> also, it is unique to my knowledge
[17:28:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> or nicks as well
[17:28:43] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Any "discriminator" would do?
[17:28:46] <gfldex> perryprog: For the channel itself, not-so-unique usernames might be fine. But there are public IRC logs that I don't want to confuse.
[17:29:07] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> <@694526400488669234> I have no idea if saiph will run on a Mac. Let me know how it goes and patches welcome.
[17:29:25] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> I mean your discriminator is 7232, it's random generally
[17:30:35] <perryprog> Right. It doesn't give any information on the IRC side of things. I bet $20 imaginary dollars that there isn't—and hasn't—been a single username collision on the discord side of the bridge.
[17:30:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> OK, right, it is not something I could make-up on the spot.
[17:31:38] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> I am getting now a failure for installing Raku's `Readline` -- not a `saiph` error per se.

[18:05:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @avuserow#1203 It looks like on Mac OS X `gpg` is used instead of `gpg2` : https://stackoverflow.com/q/54895263/ .
[18:06:56] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @avuserow#1203 So, I changed the test `ok which('gpg2'), 'gpg2 in PATH';` to `ok which('gpg'), 'gpg in PATH';` and I was able to install `saiph`.
[18:09:43] <discord-raku-bot> <avuserow#1203> I should remove that. gpg is no longer used for the current format. (I guess you could trick it into using the older format but I'd rather not...)
