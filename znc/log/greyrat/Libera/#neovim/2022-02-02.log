[08:17:13] <spikespaz> Does airline use unicode characters for the background of their bars? I am thinking yes because I disable highlighting for Normal and EndOfBuffer to use the terminal's transparency. I want to know if I can change that from the pipe character to just fill the whole character with a color, should I use a unicode block, or use gui, guifg, or guibg?

[10:59:33] <Bernie[m]> Since yesterday, I've been getting these errors from nvim built from git:
[10:59:33] <Bernie[m]> E355: Unknown option: &cpo
[11:01:30] <Bernie[m]> several .vim files in the runtime dir still use &cpo, and I don't think it's been removed... is this a bug in the VimL parser?
[11:02:00] <clason[m]> do you have a minimal reproducing example (with `nvim --clean`)?
[11:02:46] <clason[m]> nothing should have changed in that regard yesterday
[11:04:07] <Bernie[m]> the system's /usr/bin/nvim works fine with the same init.vim
[11:04:44] <clason[m]> that doesn't help me
[11:04:49] <Bernie[m]> nvim --clean eliminates all the errors on the runtime files, but i still get a few from the plugins
[11:05:03] <Bernie[m]> for instance:

[11:14:19] <clason[m]> so there's a problem with your build

[11:16:19] <clason[m]> yeah, can't say anything about that -- all I can promise that the "official" build works fine
[11:16:32] <clason[m]> (although I don't see how bundled deps should affect that)
[11:16:36] <Bernie[m]> but Fedora Rawhide's packaged version of neovim works fine, so i would exclude a bug in the distro libs
[11:16:45] <clason[m]> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[11:17:14] <clason[m]> their build scripts might be more extensively patched to work with distro libs; that happens

[13:51:41] <jaawerth[m]> maybe tmux is coverin them up for you
[13:52:09] <jaawerth[m]> I doubt kitty will ever fix it at any rate. the author blames... somebody
[13:52:13] <jaawerth[m]> for being wrong
[13:52:57] <jaawerth[m]> (there's a fair amount of that with kitty)
[13:53:01] <RobinSkahjem-Eri> yeah .. that might be .. but my first command running alacritty is tmux, and alacritty isn't making a fuzz about being used with tmux.
[13:53:19] <RobinSkahjem-Eri> * might be (alacritty having similar TERM issues) .. but
[13:54:09] <jaawerth[m]> yeah because both have capabilitis that stray from xterm and the other ones most terminals more or less stick to for this exact reason
[13:54:22] <jaawerth[m]> this is actually one area where I think the kitty author has a point, haha
[13:57:05] <sunjonSenghanBri> are there areas you think he doesn't? :]
[13:57:20] <sunjonSenghanBri> I think he usually makes very well reasoned arguments
[13:58:26] <sunjonSenghanBri> re: the SSH approach, keyboard and graphics protocols
[14:01:41] <jaawerth[m]> true. I just think he goes a tad overboard about it sometimes. like, yes, he has a point that multiplexers are fundamentally a hack but at the same time you can't just handwave away how useful tmux can be for certain scenarios
[14:01:50] <jaawerth[m]> I've stopped using it locally but it's still a goto for remote use
[14:02:13] <sunjonSenghanBri> yeah, I was thinking how I was going to elaborate on what I said
[14:03:15] <sunjonSenghanBri> I think the difficulty is "My answers assume you wanting to continue using this product with whatever product/tech/protocol you're having an issue with"
[14:04:16] <sunjonSenghanBri> the "no, because that would be technically wrong" <Issue closed> is shorthand. There's obviously _some_ consideration as to the pros/cons, effort involved, before giving a response
[14:05:04] <sunjonSenghanBri> EFM and Null-LS are apparently great concepts, and lots of people use them
[14:05:33] <sunjonSenghanBri> but I've seen Atrius dealing with issues that are soley caused by their choice to use that
[14:05:54] <sunjonSenghanBri> like a 30:1 ratio of issues, vs those using a simple linter or formatprg
[14:06:12] <sunjonSenghanBri> the same ratios apply to any project that involves terminal + tmux

[16:38:42] <d1rewolf_x> as someone who has used the basics of vim for decades but is now trying to learn the advanced usage (particularly as a python editor) I find that many plugins use "shared" concepts or built-in features. I'm struggling a bit to learn this shared concepts in an effective way.
[16:38:58] <d1rewolf_x> for example, different autocomplete plugins use the keys documented in ins-complete-menu
[16:39:34] <d1rewolf_x> is there a guide or book out there that covers the basics someone might want to know?
[16:39:49] <d1rewolf_x> aside from asking here, I would have never known to look at :h ins-complete-menu
[16:40:01] <clason[m]> there's the manual: `:h usr`
[16:41:36] <d1rewolf_x> clason[m]:  for some reason thought the manual was a guide through the basics of editing/navigation. Although it's been many years since I read any of it. Perhaps I am thinking of :Tutor
[16:41:56] <clason[m]> yes, that would be `:tutor`
[16:42:23] <d1rewolf_x> ok, so following through :h usr will cover things like autocomplete, etc?
[16:46:06] <d1rewolf_x> clason[m]: your silence speaks volumes ;-). Ok, I'll rtfm. Just one thing would help...after pressing :h usr to enter it, how can I make the manual take up the entire nvim window instead of having the split?
[16:46:29] <jaawerth> well completion is a big topic if you wanna know allll the native options. if you want to skip to the most bang-for-the-buck, I'd look at `:h compl-omni` and `:h omnifunc` first
[16:46:36] <clason[m]> not autocomplete, since that is not a thing in (Neo)vim, but completion is (in `usr_24.txt`)
[16:46:41] <jaawerth> there are definitely guides around but I don't know any offhand
[16:46:52] <jaawerth> but yeah it isn't auto unless you use a plugin or write some code to make it so
[16:47:11] <clason[m]> Just move to the other split and close it?
[16:48:37] <jaawerth> d1rewolf: <c-w>| or <c-w>_ to "zoom" the pane depending on layout, or <c-w>T to split it into a new tab would be the go-to ways

[17:30:38] <sunjonSenghanBri> again, "key delay vim" gets you the answer to #1 (:h nowait)
[17:32:16] <sunjonSenghanBri> and the article concludes by linking to a plugin, that's going to have been battle-tested a little, and any issues you encounter within minute#2 of trying it, are likely to have been documented or addressed

[20:16:56] <mjlbach[m]> you can do the same in an vimrc
[20:16:59] <coldspark29Jan[m> Guess that is different on English layouts
[20:17:54] <clason[m]> nah, it's just chosen because it's a key sequence least likely to be used for a terminal program
[20:18:07] <clason[m]> it's assumed that you'll map it to something more convenient to you
[20:19:54] <coldspark29Jan[m> Why not just move around with Ctrl+w?
[20:19:57] <coldspark29Jan[m> Like always?
[20:20:27] <clason[m]> I don't know what you want to hear
[20:20:37] <coldspark29Jan[m> The reason
[20:20:51] <coldspark29Jan[m> Usually people have a reason for doing things/or not doing them
[20:20:56] <clason[m]> because a terminal application is much more likely to (want to) consume `<c-w>`
[20:20:56] <coldspark29Jan[m> 😛
[20:21:17] <sunjonSenghanBri> It's hard to believe that Vim changes window with <C-w> from insert mode.
[20:21:24] <clason[m]> and because why should the terminal buffer be different to other buffers? you can't use `<c-w>` in insert mode there either
[20:21:32] <coldspark29Jan[m> @sunjon It does though
[20:22:02] <coldspark29Jan[m> at least in the terminal buffer
[20:22:07] <sunjonSenghanBri> it's a readline default..
[20:22:31] <sunjonSenghanBri> let's reverse the question
[20:22:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> how do you go <back word> when inputing text in the terminal?
[20:23:12] <coldspark29Jan[m> The old school way I guess
[20:23:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> face on backspace key?
[20:23:30] <coldspark29Jan[m> yep
[20:23:41] <coldspark29Jan[m> I don't use vim mappings in the terminal
[20:23:47] <clason[m]> well, you're missing out, then ;)
[20:23:56] <coldspark29Jan[m> I get it
[20:24:03] <coldspark29Jan[m> Sometimes I wanted to have that
[20:24:14] <clason[m]> it's not a Vim mapping, it's standard terminal
[20:24:17] <coldspark29Jan[m> But then I don't have it when just using Konsole 
[20:24:29] <clason[m]> you should
[20:24:39] <clason[m]> has worked in any terminal I've been in so far
[20:24:47] <sunjonSenghanBri> https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/readline.3.html
[20:24:58] <sunjonSenghanBri> readline is how a lot of terminal commands handle input
[20:25:05] <sunjonSenghanBri> it gives you a standard set of mappings
[20:25:24] <sunjonSenghanBri> you'll see C-w is `unix-word-rubout`
[20:25:38] <sunjonSenghanBri> C-w has meaning in Bash/ZSH/Emacs/etc/etc/etc
[20:25:52] <clason[m]> `<c-u>` is also neat
[20:26:03] <sunjonSenghanBri> thus me finding it hard to believe that a plain invocation in Vim would do that
[20:26:15] <clason[m]> it does...
