[00:56:48] <Azrael_-> i'm root and want to create a new folder at a location but always get the information: mkdir: cannot create directory ‘test’: Permission denied  i know there is a chmod setting i have to change but i just can't remember what it was called again. can you give me a hint?
[00:56:49] <Dagmar> I'll say that generally you need to just use a different theme to get lightdm to do things like that
[00:56:56] *** Joins: progandy (~progandy@user/progandy)
[00:57:03] *** A_Dragon is now known as RemoteHost
[00:57:21] <Jacki> but the size change i need is big
[00:57:42] <Dagmar> Azrael_-: The system generally doesn't countermand root's orders.  If the directory you're in is completely read-only, there's probably a reason for that.
[00:58:30] <msiism> Jacki: Doesn't lightdm use just the same icon theme and size as GTK in general (on a particular system)?
[00:58:39] <Azrael_-> Dagmar: yeah i know, the folder has 777 as permissions setting. yet there is a folder-attribute which disallows all modifications in there and i just forgot which one it was so i can disable it for now
[00:59:07] <Dagmar> Azrael_-: `chattr -i <location>`
[00:59:29] <orange97> speaking of root, quite a stupid question but, is there a practical difference to being root and just running sudo bash ?

[01:02:03] <orange97> hmm interesting
[01:02:18] <themachine> well, that's not entirely accurate
[01:02:23] <themachine> it depends on how you have sudo configured
[01:02:36] <themachine> if you give a sudo user full root privs then sure there is no practical difference
[01:02:48] <themachine> but you can also use sudo to provide only a limited set of commands

[23:35:27] <drip> for what its worth, in bash you can do: trap '' SIGINT && command

[23:40:40] <byte4byte> what yall nerds up to?
[23:40:50] <webstrand> drip: That's a lot closer to what I want than anything else. Is it possible to kill -INT just the `command` and none of its children when SIGINT is trapped?

[23:44:23] <drip> i dont think so that way, since bash handles the trap when the command completes

[23:49:12] <webstrand> drip: the `command` itself is spawning the subprocesses. I may be misunderstanding, but since the subprocesses are part of the foreground process group they get sent SIGINT on ctrl+c

[23:51:50] <webstrand> if I could set the process group of `command`, that'd solve the issue, too.
