[03:45:41] <Wallboy> Hi, I have some video footage shot at 29.97fps and I'm wanting to re-encode all the footage to just 30fps (without speeding up video). So I've tried using the fps=30 filter to do this. However this introduces a subtle annoying stutter every ~32 seconds which I'm guessing has to do with how the frame duplication is working. Any other better ways to go about doing this without introducing a
[03:45:41] <Wallboy> stutter?
[03:47:11] <BtbN> How else do you plan to change to fps to 30?
[03:47:25] <BtbN> Either you speed it up ever so slightly, or occasionally duplicate a frame
[03:48:15] <Wallboy> Right, I've tried to think how else it would work, like a better way to spread over the dupe frames where their not as noticeable. But then I thought that this would requie a multiple pass system to first detect the best areas to do this which I'm guessing doesn't exist
[03:48:45] <Wallboy> Funny enough, I've done 25fps to 30fps videos this way and didn't notice the stutter
[03:49:12] <BtbN> Best way is to just not touch the framerate really
[03:49:58] <Wallboy> ya, the reason I want to is that I have some other videos around 24 and 25 fps that I also want to bring up to 30 fps, since I eventually might want to concatenate some of the clips together and not have a mixed framerate video
[03:51:29] <Wallboy> I wonder how minterpolate would handle this situation
[03:51:53] <Wallboy> I'm guessing it's going to try to mess with every frame though and not just try and interpolate only the dupe ones
[03:52:16] <furq> you can speed up the video without reencoding it
[03:52:22] <furq> so probably better to do that and just reencode the audio

[03:52:53] <furq> for starters you could feasibly do that to lossless for later editing without taking a ton of space

[04:20:02] <Wallboy> Hmm, so I just tried -r 30 instead of the fps filter and it's doing a MUCH better job. Stutter is gone and it's only putting in a single dupe frame every 30 seconds which I can't notice. Oddly enough I've had better luck with the fps filter in the past. I'm guessing -r is better when your converting a small framerate amount like 29.97 -> 30, whereas fps filter is better for larger gaps like 25
[04:20:02] <Wallboy> -> 30fps
[04:30:27] <Wallboy> Yeah, frame stepping through the fps filter video and it seems it's duplicating way more frames then it needs to. If I've done my math correctly, there should only be 36 dupe frames added in 20 minutes worth of video when going from 29.97 -> 30. The fps filter is adding a lot more of them then is needed every 30 seconds over the course of about 1 second which gives the illusion of the video
[04:30:27] <Wallboy> dropping to 15fps for that second

[05:55:54] <kepstin> if you're getting an effect like that, then the timestamps in your source video must be a bit messed up
[05:56:29] <Wallboy> How can I confirm that?
[05:57:29] <kepstin> hmm. dunno the best way; there's some debug logs with ffmpeg that show frame info, or you can use the -show_frames option on ffprobe to see pts
[05:58:30] <kepstin> the way the fps filter works is for each input frame it converts from the input timebase to output timebase (output timebase is set to 1/fps), then drops frames if multiple frames mapped to the same output timestamp, and dups frames to fill in timestamp gaps
[05:58:38] <kepstin> it'll never change the actual timing of the video
[05:58:48] <Wallboy> Will simply remuxing regenerate timestamps? I could then try remuxing to the same container type and then try the fps filter again
[05:58:55] <kepstin> (except for jitter introduced by the timebase conversion, that is)
[05:59:13] <kepstin> remuxing normally copies timestamps
[05:59:24] <kepstin> so it shouldn't make any difference
[06:00:07] <Wallboy> vysnc drop?
[06:00:27] <Wallboy> apparently that regens them
[06:00:54] <kepstin> if you know the timestamps in your input file are bad, you can use the -r input option rewrite them
[06:01:08] <Wallboy> i don't know if there bad, that's the thing
[06:01:44] <kepstin> honestly, the easiest way is to watch the video playback in realtime on the area you're worried about?
[06:02:20] <Wallboy> yes the source video plays back perfectly
[06:02:41] <kepstin> what file format, by the way?
[06:02:43] <Wallboy> it's only when using the fps filter to reencode that the stutter started happening
[06:02:44] <Wallboy> mkv
[06:02:53] <Wallboy> and i'm going from mkv source to mp4 after encode
[06:02:56] <Wallboy> x264
[06:03:18] <kepstin> well, there's gonna be some periodic stutter with converting from 30/1.001 to 30 fps
[06:03:50] <kepstin> should be a duplicate about every 33s
[06:04:21] <Wallboy> that's exactly what happens as I said above, the stutter happens about every 32s for half a second
[06:04:36] <kepstin> shouldn't be half a second, i don't see how that could happen.
[06:04:38] <Wallboy> using -r 30 worked way better and way less dupe frames and the stuter disappeared

[06:08:56] <Wallboy> stutter still present after the -r 29.97 remux btw
[06:09:12] <Wallboy> i'll run that command now, give me a few mins
[06:09:17] <kepstin> (fyi, i am the person who wrote the fps filter, i'm honestly trying to figure out what went wrong here)
[06:09:57] <kepstin> the current fps filter with debug log level will log the input and output pts values of every frame, and note how many times frames got duplicated.
[06:11:00] <Wallboy> Sounds good, because when I stepped through the video in the player over the problematic areas, there was a lot more dupe frames in that single half second chunk of video compared to -r 30 which only had a single dupe frame

[06:14:23] <Wallboy> oops, forgot to change input filename on remuxed file, testing that again first
[06:16:35] <kepstin> hmm. I think i might see the problem. the default rounding behaviour isn't great with really close framerates.
[06:16:59] <Wallboy> i tried all the rounding behaviours btw, the only effect it had was shifted the time the stutter happened
[06:19:51] <kepstin> hmm. I'll have to think about this a bit more. The problem is that there's a period of time where the rescaled pts output values do something like 1660, 1662, 1663, 1663, 1665, 1666, 1666, 1668, 1669, 1669, 1671
[06:20:20] <kepstin> so the scaled pts ends up skipping a value (this is expected), but then the next value gets repeated instead of increasing by one
[06:20:33] <kepstin> so there's some sort of weirdness going on with the pts rescaling math
[06:21:49] <kepstin> well. no quick fix for you, but this certainly is a weird issue.

[06:33:43] <kepstin> I'd still like to find out what the particular timebases in your file are tho.
[06:33:53] <Wallboy> i'll ffprobe those, one sec
[06:34:15] <kepstin> you said mkv input, right?
[06:34:18] <Wallboy> yes
[06:34:20] <kepstin> should be 1/1000 timebase then
[06:34:29] <Wallboy> yup 1/1000
[06:35:06] <Wallboy> codec_time_base 1001/60000
[06:35:32] <Wallboy> r_frame_rate 30000/1001
[06:36:11] <Wallboy> https://filebin.net/p8skn0oxkxlz3754 here try this one
[06:36:45] <kepstin> ok, so there's a possible - really fun - workaround here. use "fps=30000/1001,fps=30"
[06:37:10] <kepstin> the first one fixes the quantized mkv timestamps which can't accurately represent 30/1.001 fps, and then the second should get correct rounding behaviour
[06:41:14] <kepstin> the problem is .. that the input file timestamps are messed up, since with the mkv fixed timebase of 1/1000, the 30/1.001 framerate - which should have pts incrementing by 33.36ms per frame, is instead incrementing mostly by 33ms but sometimes by 34ms, and that's causing the rounding when converting down to 30fps to be off.
[06:41:32] <Wallboy> yup, it seems your double fps filter solution does indeed get rid of the stutter :)
[06:42:07] <kepstin> going from 33.36ms to 33.33ms frame durations is just enough to cause some rounding issues when there's quantization to milliseconds :/
[06:42:14] <kepstin> and this is the reason i dislike mkv
[06:43:16] <kepstin> it's "good enough" for playback, but the fact that it can't preserve timebases properly means it's not good enough as an intermediate.
[06:43:33] <Wallboy> however, for small framerate changes like i'm doing from 29.97 -> 30, just using -r 30 gets the job done without introducing anything stuttery. However like I mentioned above, when doing stuff like 25 -> 30 fps, using -r introduced noticeable stutter/jitter and then using your fps filter in those cases worked great
[06:45:17] <kepstin> yeah, the -r option has very different logic, it does a kind of weird "force things to fit" behaviour.
[06:47:04] <Wallboy> yeah from what I can tell, -r 30 is evenly spreading out the dupe frames. So for 20 minutes of video, it evenly spreads out 36 dupe frames. And those are completely unnoticeable in playback
[06:47:57] <Wallboy> did you see my new link above for the debug output you wanted? should work hopefully on that filehost
[06:47:57] <kepstin> my test file was 24/1.001 fps instead of 30/1.001, but i got mkv timestamps 69292, 69333, 69375 - which when converted to 30fps timestamps without rounding give you 1663.008, 1663.992, 1665.000
[06:48:45] <kepstin> got it, yeah, matches the behaviour i saw

[06:50:53] <kepstin> so in my example, there was a 41ms gap between frames followed by a 42ms gap, which just happen to line up badly enough that when rounded down that you got two frames with the same pts, followed by one with a big gap
[06:51:05] <kepstin> (i was using rounding down in this example, but as you saw it affects all rounding modes)
[06:52:35] <kepstin> there was a 0.984 frame gap between frames 1 and 2, and a 1.008 frame gap between frames 2 and 3 :/
[06:53:02] <kepstin> and it lined up badly enough that after conversion it dropped the short gap and doubled the frames to fill the long gap
[06:53:11] <kepstin> man, mkv...
[06:53:27] <Wallboy> so this is only an issue with mkv sources you figure?
[06:53:57] <kepstin> not only mkv, but mostly mkv
[06:54:20] <kepstin> mpeg-ts uses a much higher timebase that mostly avoids the issue, mp4 stores accurate timebases (most of the time), for example
[06:56:41] <kepstin> I'm not sure there's anything I can do in the fps filter, except requantizing the input timestamps if the input claims to be constant fps but the timebase doesn't match the fps.
[06:56:49] <kepstin> which.. actually doesn't sound like a bad idea

[09:46:10] <Guest22> Hello. Not sure if my question is appropriate for this channel but I am sure someone can help me. I am analyzing a video which uses m3u8 file to fetch segment. The first segment is 10 seconds but surpirsingly, the video starts at 1.46 seconds. Why is that? videojs is able to play it fine

[19:12:10] <ervin19> Hi, is it possible to set the out video start time (bigger than 00:00:00) while converting images-seq. to mov?
[19:15:44] <kepstin> yes; one way is you could use the setpts filter to add an offset
[19:16:04] <JEEB> I would guesstimate something like -itsoffset and then on the output side -avoid_negative_ts disabled

[22:28:33] <jcelerier> hi :)
[22:28:51] <jcelerier> I'm running the following command:
[22:28:58] <jcelerier> ffmpeg -f x11grab  -i :0.0 -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt argb -f v4l2 /dev/video0
[22:29:07] <jcelerier> and in another terminal ffplay /dev/video0

[22:29:30] <jcelerier> but when doing that ffplay detects it as BGR:

[22:29:38] <jcelerier> (and of course the colors are wrong
[22:29:44] <jcelerier> on ffmpeg 4.4.1
[22:33:48] <jcelerier> likewise for 0rgb
