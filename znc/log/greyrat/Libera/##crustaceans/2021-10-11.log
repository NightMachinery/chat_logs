[02:43:10] <dimadima> vscode gets subtly worse and worse as time goes by for me
[02:45:26] <imode> tends to be the case with most IDEs.
[02:45:51] <dimadima> never experienced that w/ jetbrains products
[02:46:17] <dimadima> i'm chalking this up to vscode being a microsoft entrapment product
[02:46:57] <dimadima> can't imagine that's a correct usage of the word "entrapment" but eh
[02:47:11] <dimadima> imode: catching the sunset this evening?
[02:47:18] <imode> not for another two hours.
[02:47:36] <dimadima> you try to make it a daily thing or something like that?
[02:47:46] <imode> I show up every day.
[02:47:49] <dimadima> :)
[02:47:56] <dimadima> so does the sun
[02:48:00] <dimadima> least you could do
[02:48:03] <imode> heh. sometimes yes, sometimes no.
[02:48:19] <imode> I still show up on rainy days.
[02:48:31] <dimadima> so is the sun
[02:50:47] <dimadima> rainy day sunsets arent bad either
[02:50:54] <dimadima> gets dark
[02:51:07] <imode> they're some of my favorites.

[04:00:09] <jeho> dimadima, it's the extensions that one has to commonly install that slow it down.
[04:01:04] <jeho> I wonder if there's any diagnostic feature of vscode that will tell the user what extensions are bogging the application
[04:01:12] <jeho> maybe another extension...
[04:02:32] <jeho> I guess, if one really wanted to pick through a lot of data, they could pop open the chrome dev tools screen and use the analysis features of the browser.
[04:12:58] <dimadima> jeho: i don't have many extensions, but it could definitely be an extension. and it's not performance. it's little stuff now. like it used to be that if put your cursor on a variable, it showed all other usages and declaration
[04:13:15] <dimadima> now it only shows (in the scroll bar) usages but not the declaration :(
[04:14:01] <jeho> did you put vscode on another computer and not install all the extensions you're used to?
[04:14:14] <dimadima> i haven't tried that
[04:14:30] <dimadima> i sort of don't care
[04:14:35] <jeho> hard to tell what the issue is with vscode.. all the json files here and there .. and constant tweaking
[04:14:38] <dimadima> just a lot of little things like that adding up :)
[04:14:48] <dimadima> irritating
[04:14:54] <drakonis> vscode......
[04:14:56] <dimadima> but not enough
[04:14:58] <jeho> one could waste a lot of time picking through those damn json files
[04:15:14] <dimadima> yeah i minimally fuss with it
[04:16:12] <dimadima> it still refactors TS so that's all i care about :)
[04:19:21] <jeho> it's great for rust development.. it's got the best debugger support out of anything else I use
[04:20:20] <drakonis> is it?
[04:21:49] <jeho> yeah.. I do most of my editing in notepad++ or its equivalent on linux.. but when I need to dig in and troubleshoot.. the debugger support in vscode is pretty good
[04:25:20] <drakonis> but why though
[04:25:24] <drakonis> there's so many editors
[04:26:06] <jeho> the debugger integration being better than other IDE's is pretty much it.
[04:27:12] <jeho> if intellij had as good support (if it had any support at all for the matter), I'd probably prefer intellij

[11:02:38] <imode> yeehaw. https://hastebin.com/raw/uxagehafid
[11:03:26] <riv> wow!
[11:06:47] <imode> with inc_byte, dec_byte, not_zero_byte, left_byte, and right_byte, you can now transpile BF programs to this.
[11:07:14] <riv> well that opens up a lot
[11:07:25] <imode> yup, and you can optimize common BF idioms on top of that.
[11:07:43] <imode> like zeroing a byte.
[11:07:48] <Brekkjern> But why though? :P
[11:07:57] <imode> why not.
[11:08:21] <imode> need some already-written programs to test.
[11:08:35] <imode> a mandelbrot renderer seems cool.
[11:08:42] <imode> along with that text adventure.
[11:11:35] <Brekkjern> Indeed
[11:12:24] <imode> that's a lot of instructions to do something fairly trivial, though. it's messy because, again, I'm storing bytes as their bits, instead of re-encoding them as runs of 1s terminated by a 0, or storing the bits as runs of '10' for zero and '110' for one.
[11:13:36] <imode> meaning, say, checking whether a byte is 0 means using an if statement, and on the false branch, move to the next bit and check it, otherwise terminate and go to the head of the byte.
[11:15:26] <imode> so the whoooole nested if statement chain needs to be generated ahead of time.
[11:16:03] <imode> if you visualized it as some kind of state graph, you're essentially storing the position within the byte that you're checking _in the state graph_.
[11:16:31] <imode> we're just encoding that state graph in a structured form.

[17:33:08] <kline> slept well sat night/sun morning

[17:34:09] <dimadima> so sort of a late drive back again?
[17:34:11] <kline> so i drove back overnight with 3 nap stops, arrived at 6:30am, spent an hour getting my kit sorted, doing the paperwork, then went into the office at 7:30 for 8 opening
[17:34:34] <dimadima> gf lives up in scotland?

[17:35:57] <gerikson> it's a Final Boss
[17:36:34] <kline> but england has no mask mandate
[17:36:36] <kline> scotland does
[17:36:52] <dimadima> is that a cultural thing or a statistical thing?
[17:36:57] <dimadima> austrialia opened today
[17:37:05] <dimadima> or, well, sydney did
[17:40:31] <gerikson> it's a "piss off the Tories thing" ;)
[17:41:21] <dimadima> tories anti-mask in england too
[17:41:28] <dimadima> i thought that was some uniquely american insanity
[17:42:09] <dimadima> insanity/phenomenon, not trying to offend any tories here :)
[17:42:38] <gerikson> no comment
[17:42:47] <dimadima> although i guess i routinely refer to MAGA as a "cult", so
[17:42:55] <gerikson> tories can DIAF as far as I'm concerned
[17:44:02] <dimadima> i certainly wouldn't mind if certain leaders DIAF
[17:47:37] <kline> dimadima, in england the policy is "dont ask dont tell"
[17:48:03] <kline> scotland is more like west coast usa
[17:48:12] <dimadima> kline: how do you implement "don't ask don't tell" with respect to masks?
[17:48:14] <kline> england is more like east coast
[17:48:23] <dimadima> kline: that's very interesting
[17:48:31] <kline> i mean for like test infection stats
[17:48:40] <dimadima> ah
[17:48:44] <dimadima> amazing
[17:48:51] <kline> so when people arent getting tested cant get bad results, right?
[17:49:06] <kline> no bad results -> no need for masks
[17:49:06] <dimadima> well for sure, just ask our illustrious former president
[17:49:08] <dimadima> hehehe
[17:49:14] <dimadima> rates are going up cause of testing! :)
[17:49:37] <kline> i mean, its not "untrue"
[17:49:50] <dimadima> that's why it's beautifuly
[17:49:57] <dimadima> beautiful*
[17:49:59] <kline> but its only untrue because political reality can be divorced from clinical reality
[17:50:48] <dimadima> i still, to this day, do not fully understand why the conservative/liberal divide shook out the way it did with respect to covid
[17:51:14] <dimadima> you'd think conservatives would also want to be sort of careful with their general well-being
[17:51:58] <dimadima> i get that theyre all about "small government" and so that made it easy for pols to pick the niche they did
[17:52:43] <dimadima> i guess liberals are snowflakes and conservatives won't be stopped
[17:52:52] <dimadima> still doesn't totally make sense to me
[17:53:15] <dimadima> whatever
[17:53:21] <kline> small govt = non-interventionism, generally
[17:53:38] <kline> mask mandates are seen as nanny-state intervention
[17:54:13] <dimadima> kline: did anyone say that sort of thing in 1665 when they were boarding up people's homes in london?
[17:54:15] <kline> whereas liberal/left are more happy for public-good interventionism in peoples daily lives for the broader benefit
[17:55:01] <kline> i have no idea but lets not pretend we're in the same situation now as then
[17:55:12] <dimadima> yeah i was about to say, the dynamic is different i guess
[17:58:17] <kline> the only thing that really gets me are the people who are saying "its only as bad as the flu"
[17:58:24] <kline> which post-vaccine may or may not be the case
[17:58:38] <kline> but thats still essentially saying "im ok with doubling the flu deaths!"
[17:59:20] <dimadima> here those people simultaneously say "it's the flu" and "it's totally fake"
[17:59:54] <dimadima> and yeah, i remember early on the lt governor of texas came out and say we should all die and sacrifice grandma and grandpa for the economy
[18:00:07] <dimadima> the same people who say abortion is murder have no problem dying for the economy
[18:00:21] <dimadima> if you're going to be pro-life, don't be pro-death, bro
[18:00:27] <dimadima> pick one
[18:00:33] <wrl> kline: "doubling", lol
[18:00:44] <dimadima> wrl: exactly, that too
[18:00:49] <kline> tbh as horrible as it is
[18:00:51] <kline> and it is horribke
[18:01:05] <kline> if boris johnson died i think the situation would be very different - and he very nearly did
[18:01:18] <wrl> i think trump was in deep water too tbh
[18:01:21] <dimadima> or DJT, mind you
[18:01:31] <dimadima> although he contracted much later in the game than johnson
[18:02:10] <dimadima> kline: but i would argue, from what we've seen, that even if bojo had died, it's not really certain things would have been so different
[18:02:48] <dimadima> how many conservative radio hosts have died here; how many herman caines have died here
[18:03:09] <kline> radio hosts are just radio hosts
[18:03:18] <kline> it would have put the UK into a governance crisis
[18:03:26] <kline> and probably have scared the shit out of other world leaders
[18:03:34] <dimadima> the comments are all like "why didn't they give them hydroxychloroquine"; or more recently "if only they hadn't kept the ivermectin from him, those bastards!"
[18:04:05] <dimadima> kline: that's highly possible, but i would just say it's not a total certainy
[18:04:07] <gerikson> yeah it's ever-evolving
[18:04:17] <gerikson> anyway all restrictions are dropped here in Sweden
[18:04:26] <gerikson> let's hope cases don't spike in 4 weeks
[18:04:32] <dimadima> gerikson: when did they drop
[18:04:38] <dimadima> did you ever have a delta wave?
[18:04:43] <ngoldbaum> conservatives really angry the gubmint paying for a $20 vaccine but totally ok with the gubmint paying for a $2100 regeneron treatment at the hospital
[18:04:59] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: fwiw many of them reject the regeneron
[18:05:00] <gerikson> dimadima: 2 weeks ago
[18:05:12] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: but daddy trump got it
[18:05:12] <gerikson> dimadima: wtf for
[18:05:17] <dimadima> gerikson: did you have delta
[18:05:28] <gerikson> nah not too much
[18:05:29] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: yeah...
[18:05:37] <kline> dimadima, the frustrating thing is that ivermectin is _probably_ safe and maybe even effective, its just not _tested_. theres no clinical evidence to use it yet even if there are similar illnesses that we can treat with it and pro-vaccine people are in the process of scoring an own goal in denying it, even though self-administering when there are proven good vaccines is still stupid
[18:05:57] <dimadima> gerikson: i don't know why, but for example: https://www.timesofisrael.com/initial-signs-that-unvaccinated-also-refusing-lifesaving-antibody-treatment/
[18:05:58] <buttsbot> Unvaccinated are also refusing lifesaving antibody treatment - initial reports | The Times of Israel
[18:06:02] <dimadima> i've seen this in the US too
[18:06:11] <kline> people on both sides have been too quick to speak in black and white and without nuance
[18:06:26] <kline> the "masks dont help"/mask mandate thing is an example of this
[18:06:35] <dimadima> it is
[18:06:46] <gerikson> kline: there's massive disinfo around invermectin tho
[18:06:51] <dimadima> even if we're not sure masks help, is it really so hard to wear a surgical?
[18:06:51] <wrl> kline: ennhhh, jury still seems to be out on ivermectin
[18:07:01] <gerikson> like the same people pushing it are all in on antivaxx
[18:07:05] <wrl> yeah
[18:07:21] <kline> wrl, to be clear, im not saying that i know it to be effective or not, im saying we dont know. what we do know is that it has some promise, and that well-used it is effective and useful in human diseases
[18:07:35] <gerikson> pretty sure common-sense stuff like social distancing does as much
[18:07:37] <kline> so the whole cow-deworming meme that the left push is unhelpful
[18:07:52] <dimadima> kline: totally agree, those memes are dumb and terrible
[18:07:58] <kline> and likewise vax-rejection and self administering of ivermectin is really dumb too
[18:07:58] <dimadima> the CDC tweets "you're not a horse" tweet was terrible
[18:08:01] <gerikson> if you have 2 jabs and use invermectin, good for you
[18:08:17] <dimadima> but it does smell like snake oil
[18:08:37] <dimadima> because of how it's pushed and by who pushes it
[18:08:42] <wrl> kline: for me, until the PRINCIPLE trial returns results on ivermectin then it's at *best* useless
[18:08:52] <wrl> it was the same thing with HCQ
[18:09:13] <ngoldbaum> kline: there have been if anything too many ivermectin studies, the meta-analyses say it does nothing
[18:09:17] <ngoldbaum> for covid
[18:09:22] <ngoldbaum> very effective for parasites
[18:09:41] <gerikson> so it will get rid of Trump?!!
[18:09:42] <kline> it smells of culture war where "experts" have for years been touted as agents of leftypol agenda while genuine class concerns have been run roughshod over, and a peak of anti-intellectual reaction coincided with the most need for experts and the power of niche media influence
[18:09:46] <gerikson> huge if true
[18:10:04] <gerikson> kline: now that analysis I can get behind
[18:10:17] <kline> ngoldbaum, im ok with that, too, but both sides have just been jumping at made up assumptions for/against
[18:10:32] <gerikson> but it's sitll an own-goal for the anti-intellectuals
[18:10:47] <kline> the most extreme on both sides have been actively fucking up
[18:11:04] <kline> and the moderates follow them because they cant relate to the extremes that get airtime on the other side
[18:11:26] <kline> meanwhile i just wanna grill
[18:11:48] <dimadima> hehehe
[18:11:59] <dimadima> you mean cook meat or does that mean something else in English
[18:12:39] <kline> its a meme about centerists being dumb, disengaged

[18:13:34] <dimadima> that may actually be a good thing. "engagement" today usually means nothing good
[18:14:01] <dimadima> nothing positive, anyway
[18:14:34] <dimadima> engagement => being outraged on social media
[18:14:43] <dimadima> why _not_ grill?

[18:58:11] <Brekkjern> I think the concept is decent, or at least, it's a valid usecase for a blockchain
[18:58:22] <Brekkjern> The implementation is dumb
[18:59:08] <dimadima> the fact that many pepole think that right-click-to-save has aynthing to do with NFTs is sad
[18:59:23] <dimadima> not surprising i guess
[18:59:33] <dimadima> what about the implementation is dumb?
[19:02:42] <kline> dimadima, not putting the data into the blockchain but rather a reference to the owned object, for example
[19:02:57] <kline> the blockchain entry often outlives where the reference points
[19:10:39] <dimadima> kline: wouldn't that prevent NFTs for physical objects or concepts?
[19:11:08] <dimadima> yes if it's a digital object it should be in the block
[19:11:21] <dimadima> would make the blocks big, though
[19:19:44] <kline> im not saying what the right solution is

[19:20:43] <gwozniak> And yet, it continues to happen. Imagine that.
[19:27:18] <Brekkjern> Hmm. Is the reason that people don't like Python because of the indentation that they are writing the code on whiteboards and OCRing it to run it, so the indentation never gets done right?
[19:28:07] <Brekkjern> I mean... Considering how many interviews do whiteboarding, it sounds like it's an important part of their production environment.
[19:28:49] <dmc> https://i.redd.it/zj0etb1tyss71.jpg
[19:29:42] <Brekkjern> I feel that...
[19:32:50] <deadk> if the implication is that whiteboard interviews are dumb, i agree, but i don't think it's reasonable for an interview to be like work

[21:32:51] <riv> why are people upset that some people think the virus might have been created in a lab?
[21:33:17] <riv> i dont know why people would care either way
[21:35:12] <indigo> Maybe they thought that if it was man-made, it would have been avoidable if they didn't do that research
[21:35:35] <drakonis> might be man-made for research but it isnt a bioweapon
[21:35:36] <indigo> Therefore maybe grandma didn't have to die of it
[21:36:40] <riv> hmm
[21:37:04] <riv> but that's more why someone would believe it, than get angry at people for believing it I think?
[21:39:13] <indigo> Ohhh! My bad, I misread your statement
[21:39:40] <riv> yeah what im asking is a bit obtuse, i feel like im getting into lobs theorem territory
[21:40:06] <dimadima> heh i misread it too
[21:41:10] <dimadima> my guess is because originally the lab-leak people were anti-china maga ppl, so it's kind of naturally racism adjacent
[21:41:19] <dimadima> and therefore ppl just oppose it
[21:41:27] <riv> that makes sense
[21:42:37] <drakonis> its definitely ruined by that
[21:48:45] <imode> amazon just got the official WFH guidance.
[21:48:53] <imode> that states "do what the fuck you want lmao idc".
[21:48:57] <imode> took 'em long enough.
[21:50:34] <indigo> I'm assuming you still have to get manager approval for WFH?
[21:50:55] <imode> it's done at the director level.
[21:51:10] <imode> so.. yeah.

[22:09:20] <indigo> imode: I think after the pandemic slows down, we're going to see a push to RTO everyone
[22:09:43] <dimadima> this whole thing has really ruined vaccines
[22:09:56] <indigo> I've noticed a trend that younger, more junior engineers really like the office, while more senior ones are all about working from home
[22:10:54] <dimadima> i don't know anything but that would be my guess too
[22:11:09] <dimadima> and yeah those junior colleagues will be the lynchpins
[22:11:29] <imode> indigo: really? it's been the opposite here.
[22:11:35] <imode> senior ones want RTO.
[22:11:43] <dimadima> imode: senion but non-management
[22:11:48] <dimadima> senior*
[22:12:02] <indigo> Yeah, senior but non-management +1
[22:12:22] <ngoldbaum> indigo: kids and family favors wfh
[22:12:43] <indigo> ngoldbaum: Anecdotally the opposite here for the coworkers that have kids/family
[22:12:50] <indigo> They want to get *away* from their family for the day haha
[22:12:53] <imode> indigo: no, senior management wants RTO. hell senior devs want RTO.
[22:12:53] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[22:13:06] <indigo> Interesting
[22:13:08] <imode> the rest of us want WFH.
[22:13:09] <dimadima> weird
[22:13:16] <imode> because fuck office work.
[22:13:21] <dimadima> yeah i could see wanted to get out of the house w/ kids around
[22:13:25] <dimadima> from time to time, though
[22:13:36] <imode> let 'em! just don't drag me in.
[22:13:39] <indigo> The junior devs are already RTO like five days a week, even thought it's only voluntary
[22:13:52] <indigo> And even though you have to wear a mask all day
[22:14:19] <imode> if they wanna grind, go for it.
[22:14:33] <ngoldbaum> what kind of mba program brainwashing would you have to go through to think an office lease is worth the money in 2021
[22:15:11] <ngoldbaum> same people who want to install spyware on your work computer so they can creep remote desktop without you knowing about it

[22:16:23] <Brekkjern> (don't do this)
[22:18:14] <dimadima> gah
[22:18:15] <indigo> Well, some managers think that us engineers spend too much time watching YouTube every day...
[22:18:26] <dimadima> fucking scabs
[22:18:39] <dimadima> my wife has some enthusiastic RTO junior ppl
[22:18:50] <dimadima> they're going to ruin everything
[22:19:09] <imode> indigo: if I didn't watch tech talks I wouldn't be equipped to do my job.
[22:19:10] <Brekkjern> I think I would be going insane if I had to work from home every day and not seeing anyone IRL all day...
[22:20:15] <ngoldbaum> indigo: good ol’ software industry, trying to convert a fundamentally creative exercise into a henry ford model T assembly line
[22:20:40] <indigo> ngoldbaum: Right??? My manager is asking me whether I can farm out the implementation of pieces of my project to people
[22:21:02] <dimadima> Brekkjern: me too, tbh, that's why i finally got back on IRC and IRC isn't even IRL :) but 5 days a week, forced, is kind of senseless
[22:21:29] <imode> I'd love to never see another human being other than my family again.
[22:21:40] <imode> online interaction fills the void.
[22:22:01] <dimadima> well tbh after 10 years in new york i'm sort of the same
[22:22:04] <indigo> I think it's fine to farm out creative pieces but when you get to a certain granularity you are essentially writing the code in review comments
[22:23:27] <dimadima> ngoldbaum: it's called "agile", or something
[22:23:51] <indigo> I think they don't realize that the software *is* the assembly line
[22:23:51] <dimadima> how did we get onto this model t topic, not seeing anything in scroll about that, though
[22:24:06] <indigo> And the engineer is designing/building the assembly line
[22:25:00] <dimadima> something's got to build the assembly line, though
[22:44:32] <gwozniak> I will say that I'm happy with WFH for me,
[22:44:56] <gwozniak> but I'd not object to RTO if I didn't have to commute too much
[22:45:15] <gwozniak> I don't mind working in an office environment
[22:46:03] <gwozniak> It was always the commute that sucked.
[22:50:06] <gwozniak> There are always some times I don't want to be bothered by others or have other things to do, so a hybrid approach is likely what I would want
[22:52:27] <indigo> I wonder if most of a team is RTO, will the WFH people get treated like second class
[22:52:33] <imode> meh.
