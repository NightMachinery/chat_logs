[01:19:23] <teresko> what's the standard approach for generating UUID in php?
[01:19:57] <teresko> it looks like the RFC died many years ago ..
[01:20:51] <judah> teresko, https://github.com/ramsey/uuid
[01:20:58] <Albright> teresko: Yeah, oddly PHP has a billion built-ins but nothing to make a uuid. I suggest using a library such as https://github.com/ramsey/uuid
[01:23:40] <teresko> also, should I stick with v4?
[01:24:09] <judah> 4 is random, which is a great place to start
[01:24:17] <judah> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier
[01:24:31] <teresko> which is why I was asking
[01:24:37] <judah> When you ask for a uuid, v4 is what most people think of. There are other types to note of, but you most likely want 4
[01:24:55] <Albright> Yeah.
[01:27:51] <judah> Also, not that it matters much, but if its going into a database do yourself a favor and store in binary
[01:28:36] <judah> taking a binary uuid and casting it to hex then encoding as text to store in a database, just to be indexed as text
[01:28:48] <judah> its not doing any favors
[01:28:56] *** Joins: hays (rootvegeta@fsf/member/hays)
[01:29:10] <Albright> I'd say to use your DB's standard UUID field type if it provides one. Otherwise, a string field which is set as a key never got anyone fired (that I'm aware of)

[01:59:51] <teresko> but I strongly suspect that you have the wrong idea regarding the point of design patterns
[02:00:08] <teresko> design patterns are NOT blueprints for your code

[02:12:50] <Guest6792> i can see that more pattern designs for example: CREATIONAL PATTERN DESIGN, STRUCTURAL PATTERN DESIGN, BEHAVIORAL PATTERN DESIGN -> and this pattern designs have i think that subgroups CREATIONAL DESIGNS -> Constructor, Factory, Abstract Factory, Prototype, Singleton, Builder ; Structural Design -> Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy ; BEHAVIORAL DESIGN -> Chain of responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento,

[02:20:58] <__adrian> start with wikipedia, even.
[02:21:22] <__adrian> or the book teresko mentioned, ofc.
[02:21:41] <__adrian> (that's "the book")
[02:22:29] <teresko> as an alternative, I personally read https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Explained-Perspective-Oriented/dp/0321247140 long time ago
[02:22:49] <teresko> IIRC it had for each pattern "how not to use it" section

[03:20:34] <teresko> so, no, I think "no framework" would be the preferable option
[03:20:55] <teresko> the "app" god object still makes me angry
[03:21:10] <teresko> or should I call it "god singleton"
[03:21:49] <teresko> and it's a gnostic god
[03:23:08] <olle> So don't use it?
[03:23:17] <olle> Inject the parts of it you need in each service
[03:23:56] <teresko> that's what I would do in 2021, yes, but I worked on it ... dunno .. maybe 2008 or 2010
[03:24:05] <olle> Mm
[03:24:25] <olle> But still: You can use old frameworks in new ways to reduce the "damage" of global stuff etc
[03:24:40] <teresko> I know, we at work have ZF2
[03:25:53] <olle> Dunno anything about really. Except repo pattern.
[03:28:23] <jamesmartinez> teresko: I enjoy ZF2
[03:30:56] <teresko> there is no accounting for lack of taste
[03:31:45] <olle> Well
[03:31:52] <olle> Can't go online without strong opinions, you know :)

[05:23:46] <znf> Hm.
[05:24:11] <znf> Why is this code https://pastie.dev/nCmNIG.php -- complaining that $raw_data (line 52) is empty when I do `echo something | ./script.php`
[05:25:41] <__adrian> because it's potentially not defined
[05:26:13] <__adrian> i'd guess either you couldn't open stdin, or there were no lines
[05:26:30] <znf> would I need a newline \n ?
[05:26:30] <__adrian> note that   $some_variable;  on its own doesn't accomplish anything
[05:26:35] <__adrian> what?
[05:27:03] <znf> do I need a newline in the stdin for that code to read it properly?
[05:27:12] <__adrian> by "complaininng" do you mean, there's an error? e.g., "undefined variable $raw_data" ?
[05:27:20] <znf> yeah
[05:27:49] <__adrian> look at line 43. you might not be doiong anything at all.
[05:27:57] <__adrian> var_dump($stdin_fh);

[05:29:12] <znf> (changed the code a bit)
[05:29:18] <znf> (as in, repositioned some stuff)
[05:29:54] <__adrian> so after your while loop, var_dump($raw_data);

[05:32:56] <znf> aaaaaaaaaa\n by the looks of it

[05:33:20] <znf> oh

[05:33:36] <znf> got it
[05:33:43] <__adrian> back up, remember what i said about line 39
[05:33:45] <znf> why would they put this code in the documentation, damn it
[05:33:49] <znf> yeah
[05:33:49] <__adrian> it's useless. does nothing.
[05:34:01] <__adrian> $raw_data = "";  otoh, would.
[05:34:04] <znf> it's their boilerplate code from the documentation, kinda weird
[05:34:13] <__adrian> so here's something else to consider
[05:34:25] <__adrian> don't do it this way.  https://www.php.net/commandline.io-streams
[05:34:50] <__adrian> you can also file_get_contents it.
[05:35:10] <__adrian> you're trying to get all of stdin and json_decode it, yes?
[05:35:50] <znf> yup, I *think* that's what their internal plugin stuff uses, just passes a json string to stdin for the scripts it calls
[05:36:10] <znf> And that's the code they showcase https://api.docs.cpanel.net/guides/guide-to-standardized-hooks/guide-to-standardized-hooks-hook-action-code#php-script
[05:37:25] <__adrian> $input = json_decode(file_get_contents(STDIN), true, 512, JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR);
[05:38:04] <Rockwood> __adrian, hi sir
[05:38:50] <znf> what's the 512 for?
[05:39:00] <znf> 512 bytes buffers (?)
[05:39:16] <znf> no wait, that's to json_decode
[05:39:22] <__adrian> https://php.net/json_decode
[05:39:45] <__adrian> it's the default $depth (my intent is only to set JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR)

[06:09:09] <znf> is there a better way of checking for --options other than doing array_key_exists() on getopt?
[06:09:44] <__adrian> sure, https://symfony.com/doc/current/console/input.html
[06:09:48] <__adrian> :p
[06:11:44] <znf> uh, no
[06:11:58] <znf> I've been spoiled by Python's argparse :P
[06:12:35] <Albright> znf: https://packagist.org/packages/zozlak/argparse
[06:12:48] <Albright> https://github.com/zozlak/argparse even
[06:13:23] <znf> I figured that must exist, but it's a needless dep for a CLI script :)
[06:14:17] <Albright> PHP's CLI tools are sufficient in a "you should be able to do anything some way or other" sense but not as deep as other languages, no.
[06:14:59] <znf> uhm, why does the last if break the script completely? https://pastie.dev/J8GVtb.php
[06:15:11] <znf> there's no error
[06:15:16] <__adrian> define "break completely"
[06:15:21] <znf> returns nothing
[06:15:40] <__adrian> what's the result of  array_key_exists('add-forward', $options)  ?
[06:15:47] <Albright> Well, you're not doing anything with $input
[06:15:56] <znf> but I'm not reaching $input
[06:16:08] <znf> __adrian, I don't know, not even the var_dump() above returns anything
[06:16:19] <__adrian> on :35?
[06:16:25] <znf> yeah
[06:16:41] <__adrian> if the script isn't getting to :35, why would you assume the problem is on :43 ?
[06:16:51] <znf> if I comment out the last if block, the var_dump returns
[06:16:53] <Blondie101010> znf: aren't you used to having a ton of dependencies in Python?
[06:16:54] <znf> (and --describe works)
[06:17:17] <znf> Blondie101010, yes, but argparse is /usually/ a given in most environments so I don't have to handle them manually

[06:17:49] <znf> error parsing
[06:17:51] <znf> wth
[06:18:01] <__adrian> !+error logging
[06:18:01] <php-bot> In addition to configuring error reporting (/msg php-bot error reporting), set log_errors=1 and error_log=/path/to/your/error.log in your php.ini file. This allows you to simply tail the log to see errors, and to disable display_errors (e.g., during production).
[06:18:02] <Blondie101010> that package is on packagist...  easier to install than any Python lib
[06:19:08] <__adrian> znf: highly recommend an editor or IDE that, at a minimum, does syntax highlighting and basic parsing.
[06:19:09] <znf> Blondie101010, yes, but then it wouldn't be a single-file script anymore and I'd have to ship/install it on my targets, while in this case argparse is already on the system due to whatever other deps are there
[06:19:22] <__adrian> heh
[06:19:41] <Albright> znf: On line 46, you need "catch (Exception $e) {"
[06:19:41] <znf> __adrian, I am running vim with a php linter, just not sure why it's not screaming at me in this case
[06:19:46] <znf> Albright, yes, I figured :)
[06:20:08] <znf> my usual vim environment is on ubuntu/debian, and I'm writing this on RHEL-based distro, things are kinda weird
[06:20:18] <Albright> I'm not sure what line 1 is about but maybe the -q is causing PHP to not cry about that error?
[06:21:58] <znf> it's meant to suppress output, by cpanel's boilerplate, wonder if that would break anything if I just remove it
[06:22:33] <Albright> If it does and you can't use Cpanel anymore, it will do you a favor

[14:02:10] <Naktibalda> if you are making request from the same browser, the obvious cause is session locking.  Execute session_write_close(); at the beginning of long running process

[14:02:57] <freeman_h> Naktibalda, 2 servers. request 1 from server A make request to server B to create a cron job. server B response saying OK 200

[15:52:51] <ArtfulDodger> Hello there! I'm activating automated tasks of an opensource ERP via Crontab on an OVH hosting. The ERP has a cron_run_jobs.php file to run its planned jobs but it's made for command line call so with Cron it complains because it's in CGI mode https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/blob/develop/scripts/cron/cron_run_jobs.php#L52-L54
[15:54:31] <ArtfulDodger> I've replaced x = argv[x] inputs by hardcoded values, but is it safe to also disable the check for CGI in the above lines or can it create other problems?
[15:54:34] *** Joins: pycode (~pycode3@2001:b07:5d28:551:8c1a:86c1:2b50:13d9)
[15:55:17] <AllenJB> Ask the software authors. The crons are obviously designed to run on commandline. We can't tell you what assumptions they made.
[15:55:38] <Naktibalda> how does your Cron run scripts?
[15:55:39] <AllenJB> Also note that long-running tasks are likely to be interrupted due to timeouts if you're trying to run them as web requests.
[15:59:20] <ArtfulDodger> Naktibalda, OVH's Crontab only runs PHP files in CGI, there is no other option (see the screenshot here https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/hosting/hosting_automated_taskscron/ )
[15:59:29] <ArtfulDodger> So I cannot create a shell script
[16:02:29] <Naktibalda> so you have to change that part which handles parameters
[16:05:00] *** Joins: guido (~weechat@host-79-32-92-124.retail.telecomitalia.it)
[16:05:00] <ArtfulDodger> Naktibalda, yes I replaced the argv[] parameters. But I'm a bit more concerned by disabling the CGI test because I don't know what could be the differences between CGI and command-line.
[16:05:07] <ArtfulDodger> I will ask the developpers

[16:35:49] <ArtfulDodger> OK I'll start by asking OVH then AllenJB Blondie101010. As an OVH customer, you would expect the Cron system of this hosting service to run CLI mode instead of CGI mode?
[16:35:56] <Kadigan> bcmath() balks at me about "function argument" not being well-formed.
[16:36:27] <teresko> ArtfulDodger: yes, it should be in CGI mode
[16:36:31] <Kadigan> "bcdiv(4.3, 10, 2);" produces an issue, but "bcdiv(sprintf("%.16F", 4.3), 10, 2);" does not... WTH

[16:38:03] <Blondie101010> ArtfulDodger:  do you have ssh access?
[16:38:18] <ArtfulDodger> yes Blondie101010
[16:38:33] <Blondie101010> look at the different php* executables
[16:39:12] <Kadigan> Naktibalda: whose bright idea was to have the *math* module run on *strings* of all things? :D
[16:39:43] <Naktibalda> Kadigan: it works with large numbers that can't be represented as integers
[16:40:30] <Kadigan> Okay. That is actually a very good reason.
[16:40:50] <Kadigan> Is there a ticket to make it disregard locale though?
[16:41:20] <ArtfulDodger> teresko, if you expect the Crontab to run in CGI mode, and my script is meant to run in CLI mode, then the problem is not due to OVH (like suggested by AllenJB )?
[16:43:12] <ArtfulDodger> Blondie101010, there is also a cron_run_jobs_by_url.php https://github.com/Dolibarr/dolibarr/blob/develop/htdocs/public/cron/cron_run_jobs_by_url.php and this one seems to work with CGI according to line 54

[20:41:16] <arash> Hello,Imagine $result is a pdo result object, we want to use $result->username in a few different lines. How much of a matter of writing good code with better performance and better execution time is it important to don‚Äôt use $username = $result->username and then use $username?
[20:41:30] <arash> In other words, should we use variables in this case? Or should we use $result->username in all our codes?
[20:43:10] <arash> $username vs $result->username
[20:43:10] <__adrian> this will have no appreciable impact on performance.

[20:44:24] <arash> yes, that's what i mean
[20:44:38] <TinoDidriksen> Keeping $result and using $result->username is cleanest, imo. Clearly shows providence.
[20:44:41] <__adrian> > what about coding style   // pick a style and be consistent
[20:46:10] <__adrian> > fetching rows as an object   // if you mean just stdClass, then my view is that's silly. arrays are for arbitrary key:value pairs. if an object, why not a specific class? why not a _domain_ object, populated from that row?
[20:46:24] <__adrian> these sorts of concerns are much more relevant/impactful
[20:50:02] <arash> its not a pdo actually, $result is a capsule object, laravel Query Builder.

[23:08:42] <AllenJB> esselfe: Disable short_open_tags in php.ini. (short open tag is '<?' - note that this will not disable '<?=')
[23:08:50] <esselfe> let me try this :)

[23:12:37] <esselfe> and in phpinfo.php which only calls phpinfo(); I can see "libXML support | active"
[23:12:45] <AllenJB> When you say "display a page", is the file with <?xml in your .php file, or a file you're processing in your script somehow? (and if the latter, how are you processing it?)
[23:13:03] <esselfe> it's the first line of an HTML file
[23:13:21] <esselfe> like there's only the error message, no content
[23:14:03] <AllenJB> What does phpinfo() say the value of short_open_tag is?
[23:14:37] <esselfe> got it, "short_open_tag | On"!
[23:14:50] <esselfe> php.ini is in /etc, I'll try putting it in /etc/php/

[23:17:50] <AllenJB> It's not necessarily "wrong" - just different. Different distros have different policies about where ini files should go. Some distros use per-SAPI (cli, fpm, cgi, etc) ini files. Some use split ini files (ini file per extension). Some use a single ini file.

[23:32:42] <sudorm> well I made my tool in PHP, but you're right
[23:32:59] <Albright> Basically you'd point the userabc domain to the myservice server but configure the server so it uses that particular webroot when a request comes in for the userabc domain.
[23:33:09] <Albright> Specifics will vary based on your server daemon.

[23:35:58] <sudorm> It should be something simple. An A record? A CNAME record?
[23:36:06] <Albright> A record.
[23:36:12] <Albright> You had it right.
[23:36:28] <AllenJB> A CNAME rather than an A record would allow the service more control over the subdomain
[23:37:02] <AllenJB> (eg. the service could change the final IP address without requiring users to perform DNS updates)
[23:37:19] <sudorm> AllenJB, it was a very good hint about Github pages: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site
[23:37:28] <sudorm> AllenJB, +1 for CNAME
[23:39:01] <sudorm> Is there a way that *wouldn't* require a special config on my own server?
[23:39:25] <sudorm> ie:   userabc.com   always redirect to myservice.com/userabc/
[23:39:42] <sudorm> (without a redirection that changes the browser URL address)
[23:40:00] <AllenJB> I don't believe so
[23:40:42] <sudorm> AllenJB, I guess it's not possible to do this DNS record:    userabc.com  CNAME   myservice.com/userabc/
[23:40:54] <sudorm> because the destination has to be a domain, and not a domain + path, is that right?
[23:41:03] <AllenJB> (The only other method I can think of I've seen to do this is a page that's just an iframe to the final page - but this has a number of drawbacks)
[23:41:17] <Albright> Yes. "paths" don't exist as a concept at the DNS level.
[23:41:25] <AllenJB> Correct - you can only do it for an entire (sub)domain using DNS
[23:41:33] <sudorm> Albright, Ok. that's what I was thinking too
[23:41:42] <sudorm> AllenJB, yes iFrame is not nice
[23:42:49] <sudorm> Then I have to configure my server to automatically create/delete  new apache2.conf <VirtualHost> and restart the webserver each time there is a new user? seems complicated. what is the more common way to handle this?

[23:45:12] <Albright> sudorm: If you're using Apache, ask in an Apache channel.

[23:46:26] <sudorm> Albright, I'll probably not use Apache for this, it doesn't seem the adapted tool
[23:46:35] <sudorm> Which tool would you use if you have to do this?
[23:47:39] <Albright> I don't know. This is still not a PHP question. Ask in #httpd or #nginx or somewhere populated by sysadmins, not lowly PHP programmers. :P
[23:47:48] <Albright> That's what I would do if I had to do this.
