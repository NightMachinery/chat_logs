[02:34:16] <re101-rat-14> Hi, I’m working on some Siri Shortcuts and utilizing the IOs regex implementation of ICU. I noticed that many of the regex patters i try to test on 101 don’t work in shortcuts or visa versa. Does Regex101 have a setting for the ICU flavor of regex or the Siri shortcuts/iOs version?
[02:36:31] <re101-rat-14> Or if not, can you recommend a site to build and test ICU regexes? Feel free to email edh2oman@gmail.com
[02:36:52] <re101-hound-49> please let me know if my understanding is correct about this  ^(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-zA-Z\{\}-])[a-zA-Z0-9\{\}-]{10,38}$ test case - 'Guest-0abc54eb-29ba-4d01-934d-c1b84a3495f9' (?=.*\d) matches- Guest-0, (?=.*[a-zA-Z\{\}-]) matches - a, [a-zA-Z0-9\{\}-] matches remaining characters. But why the pattern is not matching can you please help
[02:36:59] <Me-me> Let's look up ICU, then.
[02:37:50] <Me-me> rat: Looks like ICU uses the java engine, so anything that works in the java flavour should work there.
[02:38:14] <Me-me> You can see it on the left sidebar below Golang
[02:38:36] <re101-rat-14> Excellent! Thank you so much! I’ll try it out. :)

[02:41:22] <Me-me> Yeah, it's pretty straightforward. Your pattern has 38 as the maximum number of characters allowed but you've got 42 characters in your test string.
[02:41:55] <mysticspiral[m]> you search for up to 38 characters

[12:51:03] <re101-yorkie-83> Can anyone tell me what the "list" function does?
[12:51:21] <re101-yorkie-83> I get "match" and "substitution", but not "list"
[12:52:42] <digitok> it acts like substitution, but it only prints what you specify in the replacement value box
[12:53:02] <digitok> a simple way to extract stuff you want and format it how you like
[12:53:37] <digitok> you could say it acts more like match and print than substitution
[12:53:46] <digitok> the substitution part is that it removes the entire input :p
[12:54:23] <re101-yorkie-83> I see. I'd have assumed that a "list" would show it as a vertical list (1 match per line) rather than a string as it seems to be
[12:54:57] <digitok> indeed, but you can use \n in the replace value
[12:55:01] <re101-yorkie-83> Guess I'll just add a \n at the end of the value
[12:55:10] <digitok> this way you can join matches on a single line if required
[12:55:14] <digitok> yep :)

[23:46:40] <OnlineCop> That usually escapes characters for you, especially when inside double quotes.
[23:47:36] <OnlineCop> For example, the pattern you have there contains this: `\\{\\}` in the character group. That is, it matches a literal `\` or `{` or `\` (again) or `}`
[23:48:10] *** Quits: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:48:32] <OnlineCop> Within character groups, neither `{` nor `}` are required to be escaped, so you could just simplify that as `[...{}]`

[23:49:40] <OnlineCop> What is this regex attempting to do? Specifically: `(?=.*[a-zA-Z\{\}\- |])` is going to only match a single character in that look-ahead.

[23:52:24] <OnlineCop> You had double-escaped those `\` characters before { and }, but I see a single escape before the `-` hyphen. Could that be interpreting the hyphen as some kind of range between character '}' and the ' ' (space) ?

[23:54:48] <OnlineCop> Does your sql query support java regular expressions?
[23:55:42] <Guest5343> yes
[23:56:35] <Guest5343> https://regex101.com/r/Dy0g1J/1 this is failing
[23:56:46] <Guest5343> for lowercases its working fine
[23:57:36] <OnlineCop> Odd. Toggle the /i (case-insensitive) flag, and then look at Code Generator.
[23:58:12] <OnlineCop> For Java, it should add in a " | Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE" to the Pattern.compile() options.
[23:58:59] <Guest5343> can you paste the pattern here

[23:59:43] <OnlineCop> The 'escaped' version that Code Generator gives, or the plain pattern that's in the REGULAR EXPRESSION line on regex101?
