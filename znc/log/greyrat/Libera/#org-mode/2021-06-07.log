[19:26:28] <rdrg109> composite_higgs: When I export to PDF, images are automatically included. Perhaps, you haven't written the link to the image file correctly. You can check that by executing C-c C-o in the image link and that should open the image file. If that's not the case, then the file path might not be correctly written.

[19:38:13] <composite_higgs> When I examine the generated HTML there is just no mention of the image at all

[19:38:53] <composite_higgs> the link looks like this: [[./z.png]]
[19:39:18] <composite_higgs> There is a line above it like this: #+CAPTION: this is a caption

[19:47:44] <composite_higgs> I may have discovered a bug.
[19:47:57] <composite_higgs> It seems to only fail to encode images which are the last form in the document.
[19:50:08] <composite_higgs> Scratch that - it fails only when there is no intervening text between a previous code block and the image.
[19:50:16] <composite_higgs> If I interpose some text the image is then encoded.
[19:50:23] <composite_higgs> Guess I'll file a bug report.

[21:29:33] <Demosthenex> *sigh* i'm not sure what i did to my emacs, but suddently org-mode's text colors are "smearing"
[21:29:49] <Demosthenex> normally org recognizes end of a todo headline, or a code block, and goes back to normal text
[21:30:14] <Demosthenex> but suddenly, the dark blue of the #+END_ line is now on the normal text on the next line

[21:53:27] <rdrg109> Demosthenex: Perhaps, some code block incorrectly closed is cuasing that. That has happened to me: When there is a code block which hasn't been correctly closed (i.e. perhaps I typed #+EN_SRC instead of #+END_SRC), the behavior of Org Mode is incosistent in the file.
[21:53:49] <rdrg109> Fortunately, there is this command: org-lint which helps finding that specific error or similar errors.
[21:55:59] <rdrg109> [Q] Has any of you managed to make Yasnippet expand language-dependent snippets without expanding the code block? In other words, I would like to use the snippets in the Python code blocks, SQL code blocks, C++ code blocks from within the Org Mode file. I recall reading an article on that but I can't find it.
