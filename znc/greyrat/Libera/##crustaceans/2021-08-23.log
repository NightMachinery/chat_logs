[00:02:37] <cb> Brekkjern: linux desktop flamewars are fun bc no one gets hurt and theyre occasionally productive
[00:02:47] <cb> i'd rather all our hellthreads be about x11
[00:02:55] <Brekkjern> "Occasionally" is true :P
[00:03:07] <Brekkjern> "NO! i3 IS THE PINNACLE OF UI!"
[00:03:56] <cb> occasionally productive, usually funny
[00:04:15] <Brekkjern> "Windows 8 (an OS that was released in 2013 and reached EOL in 2018) was shit, <insert desktop environment> is much better!"
[00:04:34] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[00:04:44] <Brekkjern> But it's a sad kind of funny though
[00:04:58] <cb> olfd men fighting over scraps
[00:05:55] <Brekkjern> It's not a "good thing" for Linux that the easiest way to get shit done in it is to install it in a Hyper-V VM with the WSL2 binding on a Windows machine, instead of installing it natively on the computer...
[00:06:52] <Brekkjern> I'm beginning to think that the reason for the Linux dominance as a server OS has more to do with all the messy hardware stuff being abstracted away because everyone runs some hypervisor anyways
[00:07:53] <bkero> That's not right. That's not even wrong.
[00:08:16] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I don't understand that take at all.
[00:08:24] <manicennui> What is easier about running it in a VM?
[00:08:50] <manicennui> And Linux was far, far better on servers long before VMs were popular.
[00:08:54] <manicennui> Windows on servers is a nightmare.
[00:10:06] <Brekkjern> Not having to deal with the hardware at all as the hardware is abstracted away, well tested, and everyone runs "the same hardware" underneath.
[00:10:27] <Brekkjern> Not saying Windows servers are any better on bare metal
[00:10:48] *** Quits: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[00:10:53] <manicennui> That's not a real problem with Linux servers.
[00:11:05] <manicennui> You don't just buy random hardware and hope it works.
[00:11:21] <Brekkjern> I don't....
[00:11:21] <manicennui> I ran FreeBSD servers in the late 90s, which had even less hardware support.
[00:11:30] <manicennui> It was so, so much easier than dealing with Windows servers.
[00:11:32] <bkero> Just about every rackmount server provider certifies their hardware to run Linux.
[00:11:39] <manicennui> People only think Windows servers are easier because of the GUI.
[00:11:41] <bkero> Typically both RHEL/CentOS and Ubuntu.
[00:11:55] <Brekkjern> The 90's is the era I was born. I'd say it's pretty fucking irrelevant to todays situation.
[00:11:56] <manicennui> As soon as there is a problem, and there are far more problems, Windows is impossible to deal with in many cases.
[00:11:58] <manicennui> So you just reboot.
[00:12:21] <companion_cube> linux is still a pain to install because UEFI is crap
[00:12:26] <bkero> You'd better not look too closely at what all the application views you use run on...
[00:12:36] <manicennui> I worked for companies where our customers wanted Windows servers, and we ended up supporting them because their idiot Windows admins didn't know how to do anything that wasn't easy in the GUI.
[00:12:37] <bkero> Uhh, Linux will install on UEFI just fine
[00:12:43] <companion_cube> sure
[00:12:49] <companion_cube> but UEFI is a complicated mess
[00:12:51] <manicennui> And there are tons of things that would just become broken in Windows and wouldn't be fixable without rebooting.
[00:12:54] <companion_cube> just makes the installation more annoying
[00:13:05] <cb> UEFI is better than what came before it imho
[00:13:14] <Brekkjern> Why did we suddenly start discussing Windows servers as if I said that was the pinnacle of computing?
[00:13:20] <manicennui> companion_cube: Have you tried to install Ubuntu or Manjaro or whatever recently? It is a non-issue.
[00:13:23] <bkero> Assuming UEFI and SecureBoot are enabled in the system configuration, it's literally zero configuration
[00:13:36] <companion_cube> manicennui: I haven't
[00:13:52] <companion_cube> I only use arch 🤷
[00:13:56] <manicennui> It's only slightly harder if you do everything manually with Arch or whatever.
[00:14:01] <companion_cube> (ubuntu's major upgrades are a big no-no for me)
[00:14:04] <companion_cube> anyway
[00:14:12] <manicennui> Manjaro is basically Arch with a few niceties.
[00:14:19] <companion_cube> I'm not sure what other objections there are with linux on native hardware
[00:14:19] <manicennui> The installer being a big one.
[00:14:29] <companion_cube> hum, interesting
[00:15:07] <bkero> <Person comes in, causes shitstorm> -> Why did we suddenly start discussing a shitstorm?
[00:15:23] <bkero> Trolling 201
[00:15:34] <manicennui> The various Manjaro distros also take care of sane configs for the various desktop environments.
[00:16:23] <Brekkjern> bkero: I never claimed that Windows server was better than Linux servers in any way. I just claimed that abstracting away the HW made Linux servers shine.
[00:16:27] <manicennui> But I would never run X on a server.
[00:16:43] <manicennui> Brekkjern: It really doesn't.
[00:16:46] <manicennui> That was never the problem.
[00:17:53] <bkero> Brekkjern: That's orthagonal
[00:17:59] <manicennui> I'd love to get back to bare metal servers.
[00:18:02] <bkero> orthogonal*
[00:18:03] <companion_cube> my very meager sysadmin experience was linux on bare metal in 2008~9, it worked well
[00:18:11] <companion_cube> not sure where the hardware abstraction came into place
[00:19:11] <bkero> All platforms have varying degrees of hardware abstraction. Some platforms do it better than others.
[00:19:20] <bkero> Usually multiple layers of it
[00:19:34] <bkero> Sometimes it's dumbbbbb
[00:19:50] <bkero> Windows fucking sucked at doing anything with a VPN until Wireguard got sick of that shit and made an entire new framework for it.
[00:19:53] <companion_cube> I mean, the hardware worked well (under gentoo :s)
[00:20:08] <manicennui> I ran FreeBSD on servers I built from parts and on off the shelf Dell servers in the late 90s and early 2000s.
[00:20:11] <bkero> Yeah, go ask your Gentoo system's ACPI programs what OS it's running
[00:20:23] <bkero> and how many quirks are in the kernel to deal with that
[00:20:35] <manicennui> And ran Linux on a bunch of off the shelf rackmount servers from some smaller vendor in the early 2000s.
[00:21:26] <companion_cube> bkero: I don't understand your point
[00:21:37] <companion_cube> the kernel has a lot of code to handle the hardware, yes?
[00:21:41] <manicennui> Then I went to work in healthcare where hospitals insist on Windows and it was a nightmare.
[00:22:16] <manicennui> Also dealt with a lot of Netware and Windows servers in the late 90s.
[00:22:20] <manicennui> Netware was awesome.
[00:22:24] <companion_cube> (I should have said "amateur sysadmin" tho, nothing professional)
[00:22:48] <manicennui> I did professional sys admin work in the late 90s and early 2000s.
[00:23:08] <bkero> companion_cube: the kernel has a lot of code to handle varying types of hardware, and quirks to handle specific needs of singular devices of those types
[00:23:14] <manicennui> After that I was focused on development, but we'd have to solve problems for our idiot customers who couldn't actually run the Windows servers they insisted on.
[00:23:37] <bkero> A lot of the second type there is brain damage to accommodate for hardware design flaws *OR* design flaws that allow the hardware to better support Windows.
[00:23:50] <manicennui> For the last 6+ years I've been a developer on Linux servers and sometimes have to troubleshoot infrastructure issues.
[00:23:56] <manicennui> And maintain some Linux instances for development.
[00:24:02] <bkero> To take an old example: NDISWrapper
[00:24:58] <manicennui> I've also run almost every version of Windows since 3.0.
[00:25:10] <companion_cube> sure, I don't really see what's your point bkero :D I think we initially agreed
[00:25:52] <bkero> companion_cube: just that the hardware working well is not something to take for granted
[00:26:08] <companion_cube> ah, I see. Yes I agree
[00:26:17] <companion_cube> rather it's an impressive feat
[00:26:19] <bkero> and the amount of labor that it would take to recreate all that functionality is cost prohibitive
[00:26:28] <bkero> So nothing will ever support as much hardware as Linux
[00:26:29] <companion_cube> and linux is probably the free OS with the best hardware support
[00:26:43] <companion_cube> yeah, unless they find a way to use linux drivers
[00:26:54] <companion_cube> (and drop support for a lot of old shit_
[00:26:57] <companion_cube> )
[00:27:12] <manicennui> It's pretty trivial to do a basic amount of research before buying hardware to make sure it is well supported.
[00:27:22] <manicennui> And its not as though Windows never has problems with hardware.
[00:27:50] <bkero> lol at all the hardware that never got 64-bit Windows drivers, or ever paid the $$$ to Microsoft to certify their driver and just doesn't run under W8/10.
[00:27:57] <manicennui> Windows 2000, which is the version that was popular when Linux started taking off, didn't support things like USB well at all, among other things.
[00:28:04] <manicennui> And stability was a problem for a long, long time.
[00:28:46] <manicennui> We had customer commercial printers that required a Windows server for print processing that basically needed to be rebooted daily.
[00:28:54] <manicennui> And they were part of what was sold by the vendor.
[00:29:12] <manicennui> s/customer//
[00:30:28] <manicennui> Netware trounced Windows for print and file sharing.
[00:34:04] <manicennui> It's really baffling to watch geeks cling to MS these days.
[00:34:15] <manicennui> I kind of get it for video games, but nothing else.
[00:35:22] <manicennui> Even as they do shit like add ads to their OS.

[02:13:58] <manicennui> Probably helps if you do things other than go to class and hide in your room.
[02:14:21] <manicennui> Not saying you are doing that, but if you are, it probably isn't helping.

[02:24:29] <Brekkjern> Find a club, check out the university Discord...
[02:24:46] <manicennui> Get into drugs?
[02:24:47] <manicennui> I don't know.
[02:24:51] <manicennui> There should be plenty to do.
[02:25:21] <mouseghost> manicennui, afaik i am only aware of some extra math classes, and maybe rubiks cube group of 3 people or something :thinking:

[02:25:28] <mouseghost> drugs are bad, though..
[02:25:59] <Brekkjern> I guarantee you that there are other clubs than just a cube group
[02:26:40] <mouseghost> its just high school though, not an uni
[02:27:27] <mouseghost> meh
[02:27:56] <mouseghost> wish there was something that isnt just extra lessons with a teacher
[02:29:51] <mouseghost> at least rn is still holidays mew
[02:30:01] <Brekkjern> Well, if there isn't something at school, try somewhere else. Hackerspace, or some other activity outside school (sports or whatever)
[02:30:09] <mouseghost> meh
[02:31:25] <manicennui> Oh.
[02:31:28] <manicennui> Forget about high school.
[02:31:41] <manicennui> If you are graduating soon, just focus on university.
[02:32:01] <mouseghost> fuck ive been doing that for 12 years
[02:32:09] <mouseghost> and never had anyone to spend time with eh
[02:32:16] <manicennui> Sorry to hear that.
[02:32:28] <manicennui> This group of nerds is probably not going to be super useful in that regard.
[02:32:36] <manicennui> I'm sure most of us didn't have a ton of friends either.
[02:32:38] <mouseghost> eh i just need to vent somewhere, sorry
[02:32:51] <manicennui> I usually had a small group of friends and I couldn't tell you how we became friends.
[02:32:54] <mouseghost> imo the any vs zero is a deciding factor...
[02:33:00] <mouseghost> nobody can tell that, eh..
[02:33:06] <manicennui> But I don't talk to any of them now.
[02:33:36] <mouseghost> i do have some people who i can talk to at school now, but they are mostly "busy" and dont text me; they do sometimes reply to my messages.

[03:07:12] <manicennui> gwozniak: I participated in my company's return to office pilot because I thought I wanted to get out of the house.
[03:08:27] <companion_cube> I'm very desperate to not go to the office
[03:08:32] <companion_cube> where's the poll I can enter?
[03:08:35] <gwozniak> I don't mind going into an office if the commute is not awful
[03:09:04] <gwozniak> I certainly benefited from it when I was starting out in industry

[03:10:06] <gwozniak> Right now I'm very happy not going into an office, but I do enjoy getting together with some of my coworkers every month or two (hasn't been the case in the pandemic, tho)
[03:10:21] <manicennui> I realized that I hated getting up earlier more than anything.
[03:11:27] <manicennui> I stopped going after half a dozen times.
[03:11:28] <gwozniak> I can't stand sleeping in any more
[03:11:47] <gwozniak> I'm usually up by 7 at the latest, even if I go to sleep late
[03:12:04] <gwozniak> Sometimes I'm up at 5, although not so much these days
[03:12:15] <manicennui> I can't function if I don't get 7+ hours, and I have a hard time falling asleep at a reasonable time.
[03:12:48] <manicennui> My employer canceled their plans for us to return 3 days per week in September fortunately.
[03:13:02] <manicennui> And they are starting to allow certain people to go remote permanently.
[03:13:26] <manicennui> I'm tempted to go that route just because of how many things are good there, but I really want to work with a different tech stack.

[04:24:38] <manicennui> And why we were planning to go back 3 days per week in September.
[04:24:44] <manicennui> Which only changed because of the variants.
[04:24:48] <quanticle> I see.
[04:25:18] <manicennui> But now they are starting to let certain people go permanently remote.
[04:25:26] <quanticle> I would actually be okay with going into the office. I was hired during the pandemic, but I've been in to our office. It's nice and the commute isn't too bad.
[04:25:28] <manicennui> We've lost a few people already who found permanently remote jobs.
[04:25:55] <quanticle> What's keeping me remote is the fact that no one else is going into the office.
[04:26:19] <quanticle> Not much point of going in when you're still doing meetings via Webex

[05:34:31] <manicennui> I don't know why employers would fight this at all.
[05:34:48] <manicennui> They will save a bunch of money in the long term if everyone is remote.

[05:35:54] <manicennui> My biggest problem in Chicago is that doing everything either costs money, or it is crowded.
[05:36:05] <dimadima> but now i don't leave the house at all :)
[05:36:16] <manicennui> I want to but often don't.
[05:36:28] <dimadima> chicago oh man i used to live in chicago
[05:36:38] <dimadima> mostly bars where you drink old style in chicago :)
[05:36:44] <dimadima> was my experience
[05:36:48] <manicennui> Not quite, but that definitely exists.
[05:37:05] <dimadima> hehe i was jk. chicago wasn't for me but it was a great time nonetheless
[05:37:15] <manicennui> Even dive bars have had to start offering craft beer these days.
[05:37:16] <dimadima> lots of pbr/old style in those days
[05:37:32] <dimadima> you live in the city proper?
[05:37:37] <manicennui> But everything has been gentrified.
[05:37:38] <manicennui> Yes.
[05:37:53] <dimadima> been there a while?
[05:38:04] <manicennui> ~14 years in the city.
[05:38:07] <dimadima> wow
[05:38:10] <dimadima> long time!
[05:38:11] <manicennui> Most of my life in the metro area.
[05:38:23] <dimadima> i lived in chicago like 5-6 years
[05:38:24] <manicennui> Chicagoland
[05:38:51] <manicennui> Thinking about moving to North Carolina.
[05:38:53] <dimadima> i had a friend who lived in bucktown, right at wabansia and north
[05:39:02] <manicennui> Bucktown is nice.
[05:39:04] <dimadima> moved in just as it was getting popular
[05:39:07] <manicennui> And definitely not all dive bars.
[05:39:18] <dimadima> by the time he left it was all houses that looked like business schools
[05:39:29] <dimadima> if you know that style of urban renewal construction
[05:39:37] <dimadima> fortress/business school
[05:40:01] <manicennui> At least Chicago actually builds more housing.
[05:40:13] <dimadima> yeah chicago is good in that department
[05:40:23] <dimadima> tons of room and housing, hard to complain about that
[05:40:31] <manicennui> There are always dozens of buildings under construction.
[05:40:47] <dimadima> even in my time there south loop sprang up seemingly overnight
[05:41:05] <manicennui> Gentrification has spread pretty far south from the Loop now.
[05:41:18] <manicennui> Areas that were kind of dangerous before are pretty yuppie now.
[05:41:31] <manicennui> Down past Chinatown.
[05:41:41] <dimadima> interesting
[05:41:52] <dimadima> where are these ppl coming from
[05:42:05] <dimadima> suburbs and the rest of the mid-west?
[05:42:09] <manicennui> Suburbs and other parts of the city I think.
[05:42:19] <manicennui> Chicago's population isn't increasing.
[05:42:46] <dimadima> here's what i mean by the business school look: https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9112285,-87.675035,3a,75y,273.97h,92.37t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sUPa73QrVDwxqOXp7S2dVGA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192
[05:42:46] <buttsbot> Google Maps
[05:43:03] <manicennui> On the left or right?
[05:43:12] <dimadima> right, the new one
[05:43:25] <dimadima> i went to uchicago and the business school looked like that
[05:43:39] <manicennui> One on the left looks like it could be new mimicking older buildings.
[05:43:48] <manicennui> Yeah, that's just modern.
[05:43:58] <manicennui> Biggest problem is that they look out of place usually.
[05:44:21] <dimadima> tons of houses in the area got replaced by houses like that
[05:44:30] <dimadima> they look out of place for sure
[05:44:38] <dimadima> but as you say, and i agree, at least it's progress
[05:45:00] <dimadima> another one just up the road on wolcott https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9117099,-87.6750544,3a,75y,266.36h,90.82t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slFS26_OxA8z5dSYOnV2hlQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192
[05:45:01] <buttsbot> Google Maps
[05:45:05] <manicennui> Yeah, I'm not talking about that.
[05:45:13] <manicennui> I'm talking about highrises all over.
[05:45:27] <manicennui> There are dozens of highrises being constructed all the time.
[05:45:36] <manicennui> And multiple huge developments about to start.
[05:45:45] <dimadima> yeah that too
[05:45:57] <dimadima> not nearly as common in new york
[05:46:07] <dimadima> i wonder if those really keep the rents down. seems like they would, but i wonder
[05:46:31] <manicennui> I don't know. Too many of them are rentals, and they are near the Loop so they are pretty pricey.
[05:46:54] <manicennui> Out by me they build 3-4 story buildings with maybe 10+ units.
[05:47:00] <dimadima> i want to live near the ground man
[05:47:21] <manicennui> I want to live near mountains and nature.
[05:47:25] <dimadima> glass buildings?
[05:47:28] <dimadima> yeah me too pretty much
[05:47:34] <manicennui> Near me?
[05:47:39] <manicennui> Mostly brick.
[05:47:44] <dimadima> i meant the ones they are building
[05:48:02] <dimadima> 3-4 story yeah that would be brick
[05:48:15] <manicennui> https://chicago.curbed.com/maps/high-rise-tower-skyscraper-construction-map
[05:48:17] <buttsbot> Chicago’s high-rise construction boom, mapped - Curbed Chicago
[05:48:52] <manicennui> Only other place I've seen that is similar is Seattle.
[05:48:55] <dimadima> i saw a lot of these being built in chicago whe n iwas there last https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-plus-five
[05:48:56] <buttsbot> One-plus-five - Wikipedia
[05:49:27] <dimadima> manicennui: similar in terms of volume of construction?
[05:49:39] <manicennui> Lots of high rises going up all over.
[05:49:41] <manicennui> Cranes everywhere.
[05:49:59] <dimadima> pretty cool!
[05:50:17] <dimadima> hah the highrise going up in hyde park/woodlawn is called "Study Hotel"
[05:50:20] <dimadima> that is cute
[05:50:44] <dimadima> nice to see they are finally getting a hotel. that was a never-ending complaint down there
[05:51:14] <manicennui> The Obama library is going to start construction soon too.
[05:51:21] <manicennui> I'm sure that area will get built up.
[05:51:25] <dimadima> yeah i just saw the other day people were protesting it!
[05:51:46] <dimadima> which hadn't occurred to me but when i heard about that i thought "yeah who is obama to take over jackson park like that?"
[05:51:49] <dimadima> kind of sucks...
[05:52:02] <manicennui> No one goes to those parks.
[05:52:04] <manicennui> They are dangerous.
[05:52:18] <dimadima> i did the waterfront a lot down there back in the day
[05:52:18] <manicennui> I get the complains about housing prices going up forcing people to move.
[05:53:07] <dimadima> can't say i ever went into jackson park, that's true
[05:53:40] <manicennui> There are huge attractive parks on the south side that no one uses because of all of the gang violence.
[05:54:06] <dimadima> yeah
[05:54:44] <dimadima> it wasn't too bad when i was there, but still there were plenty of incidents
[05:54:47] <manicennui> You can get off the green line at the Garfield Park conservatory, and it is surrounded by a beautiful, empty park.
[05:54:55] <dimadima> i had some friends get robbed at gun point. they were pretty shook up
[05:55:59] <dimadima> yeah i had a friend who was a broke alcoholic who ended up living on the west side around there
[05:56:15] <dimadima> scary place
[05:56:30] <manicennui> There is a bit of a bump in crime, probably due to the pandemic.
[05:56:54] <manicennui> But the south and west sides have had a lot of gun violence forever.
[05:57:12] <manicennui> UoC is kind of an oasis in the middle of a dangerous area.
[05:58:01] <dimadima> it is. the university took a lot of flak even in my day for having bought up huge tracts of land around campus and using them as buffers
[05:58:14] <manicennui> Our mayors don't seem to care as long as they keep real estate developers happy and attract tourists.
[05:58:15] <dimadima> they did this in the 50s-90s
[05:58:42] <dimadima> mayor of chicago is possibly the shittiest/most difficult job in america
[05:58:50] <dimadima> when rahm was running i couldn't understand why
[05:58:57] <manicennui> Stepping stone.
[05:58:59] <dimadima> reallly i can't understand why anyone wants to be mayor of chicago
[05:59:05] <dimadima> but it always makes you look bad
[05:59:18] <dimadima> how can it be a stepping stone if it'll make you look incompetent?
[05:59:29] <manicennui> People forget the details.
[05:59:40] <dimadima> i guess
[05:59:42] <manicennui> And Rahm didn't have any huge scandals.
[06:00:31] <manicennui> Now he is going to be an ambassador to Japan.
[06:00:37] <dimadima> for real? i didn't hear that
[06:00:44] <manicennui> Yup.
[06:00:51] <manicennui> Was just announced last week I believe.
[06:01:01] <dimadima> that sounds 1000x better than mayor of chicago
[06:01:03] <manicennui> Ambassador seems like a nice gig.
[06:01:09] <manicennui> And Japan seems like a nice destination.
[06:01:10] <dimadima> and to japan
[06:01:33] <dimadima> yeah that's sweet good for rahm
[06:02:03] <manicennui> I saw Rahm take the CTA in the morning a few times. He lived near me.
[06:02:13] <dimadima> no way really?
[06:02:25] <dimadima> mayors don't live in an official residence?
[06:02:25] <manicennui> So did Blago, but he didn't take the CTA.
[06:02:30] <manicennui> I don't think so.
[06:02:35] <dimadima> hahaha funny... blago
[06:02:44] <dimadima> i saw obama on 53rd st once
[06:03:02] <dimadima> he hopped out of a black SUV and walked into this place called "Magic Mart"
[06:03:19] <dimadima> that was a liquor store bodega that sold alcohol to minors and was eventually shut down for that
[06:03:19] <manicennui> Oh, I also saw Rahm at a Wilco concert.
[06:03:34] <dimadima> i assume be bought cigarattes
[06:03:36] <manicennui> I've never really seen any other famous people in Chicago.
[06:03:42] <dimadima> rahm and wilco in chicago is perfect
[06:03:53] <dimadima> yeah i pretty much only saw obama that one time. that was it
[06:04:03] <manicennui> But they were filming something near our office a couple weeks ago, and one of my coworkers met Elizabeth Moss.
[06:04:04] <dimadima> i wouldn't recognize many famous ppl though
[06:04:40] <manicennui> Oh, I met one of my favorite comic book artists in a local coffee shop.
[06:04:44] <dimadima> she's that actress from mad men?
[06:04:44] <manicennui> He is a local.
[06:04:47] <manicennui> Yes.
[06:05:14] <dimadima> chicago was legitimately too cold for me
[06:05:28] <dimadima> all my friends there from the area didn't seem bothered by it. but i really couldn't handle the cold
[06:05:52] <dimadima> i learned way too late how important gear is
[06:05:53] <manicennui> I don't like it.
[06:06:07] <manicennui> But I'd tolerate it if it had other things I want.
[06:06:12] <manicennui> And I'm mostly over the restaurants and bars.
[06:06:37] <manicennui> I want to live in a building where I can't hear my neighbors, and be able to go hiking in the mountains after work.
[06:06:56] <dimadima> pacific north-west or colorado then
[06:07:06] <dimadima> i have a friend who lives in tacoma and that's his life
[06:07:12] <manicennui> Today I had the Buddhist temple making tons of noise all morning, my neighbors upstairs walking around, and the Blue Angels flying by.
[06:07:29] <manicennui> Nah, I'm not moving to the West Coast. They are pretty fucked I think.
[06:07:29] <dimadima> brutal
[06:07:42] <manicennui> Going back to North Carolina in a week.
[06:07:49] <manicennui> Really love the Asheville area.
[06:07:50] <dimadima> i'd guess tacoma doesn't have that west coast vibe
[06:07:56] <manicennui> It's not that.
[06:07:57] <dimadima> never been down there
[06:08:16] <manicennui> Too expensive and I think they are going to continue to have serious water problems.
[06:08:23] <manicennui> I loved the PNW.
[06:08:42] <manicennui> NC kind of has the opposite problem.
[06:08:49] <manicennui> They get some flooding after hurricanes.
[06:09:10] <manicennui> But we get flooding here a few times per year.
[06:09:18] <manicennui> Fortunately none in my current area.
[06:09:31] <manicennui> I figure it is just a matter of picking the right location.
[06:09:42] <manicennui> And Asheville's weather is pretty mild in summer and winter.
[06:10:37] <manicennui> Their biggest problem is lack of jobs and affordable housing, which isn't really a problem for me.
[06:14:02] <manicennui> Trying to figure out whether I should just buy some land and have something built.
[06:14:03] <dimadima> i saw a neat data project in HN within the last 1-2 months that mapped all sorts of datasets over the united states with the idea that you could find where to live based on all sorts of criteria
[06:14:20] <manicennui> I've been going on vacation to various areas to check them out.
[06:14:37] <manicennui> I've been to Seattle and Portland, Boulder, and Durham and Asheville.
[06:14:55] <dimadima> like i wouldn't want to live where certain kinds of industries has been going on, or near nuclear testing sites for example
[06:14:58] <manicennui> I've also been to various other places in the last couple decades like SF, LA, and parts of FL>
[06:15:07] <dimadima> boulder was something else
[06:15:10] <manicennui> The two places I liked the most were Portland and NC.
[06:15:28] <manicennui> Even Durham has way better access to nature than Chicago.
[06:15:36] <manicennui> There was a state park that I went to several times that was incredible.
[06:15:38] <dimadima> chicago is rough with nature
[06:15:55] <dimadima> i mean it's not really, but the distances are so great. the city itself is sooo huge
[06:16:35] <manicennui> https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g49092-d532113-Reviews-Eno_River_State_Park-Durham_North_Carolina.html
[06:16:37] <buttsbot> Eno River State Park (Durham) - 2021 All You Need to Know BEFORE You Go (with Photos) - Tripadvisor
[06:16:44] <dimadima> are you into the hipster/artist colony vibe of asheville? i've never been but that's what people report
[06:16:52] <dimadima> or is that pretty ignorable
[06:16:53] <manicennui> That place is like 15 minutes from Durham.
[06:17:11] <manicennui> I'm okay with some of that. I didn't find it at all overwhelming in Asheville.
[06:17:16] <manicennui> It is very touristy frankly.
[06:17:23] <dimadima> i don't mind tourists
[06:17:35] <manicennui> I like West Asheville a lot.
[06:17:48] <manicennui> I stayed in a place where I could walk to the main street with all of the restaurants in such.
[06:17:58] <manicennui> But I'd probably live in one of the towns around Asheville.
[06:18:13] <manicennui> Want a bit more land, and a bit cheaper.
[06:18:16] <dimadima> yeah without public transit i'm not really trying to live in a city, sadly
[06:18:45] <manicennui> The thing that I really liked when I was in NC is that I went to several different preserves and they were never crowded.
[06:18:47] <dimadima> and outside new york / chicago you don't have public transit. even the CTA is kind of ... shitty. but that's not the CTA's fault in my opinion, but the dimensions of chicago
[06:18:48] <manicennui> There are just so many of them.
[06:18:54] <manicennui> And this was pre-pandemic.
[06:19:08] <dimadima> preserves?
[06:19:15] <manicennui> State parks, etc.
[06:19:18] <dimadima> ah
[06:19:35] <manicennui> There is a nice botanic garden in both Asheville and Durham.
[06:19:41] <manicennui> The one in Durham is actually amazing.
[06:19:47] <manicennui> I liked it better than the Chicago botanic garden.
[06:19:50] <dimadima> so many nice gardens all around really
[06:19:56] <dimadima> big, small
[06:20:04] <manicennui> Durham is not near the mountains, but it has some elevation changes that you don't see anywhere near Chicago.
[06:20:21] <dimadima> that's always fun, i really elevation changes
[06:20:51] <manicennui> Near Asheville there are like hundreds of hiking trails.
[06:21:09] <manicennui> Along the Blue Ridge Parkway there is some place to pull over every half mile or something and there is almost always a trail.
[06:21:18] <dimadima> yeah it's all those mountains right there
[06:21:44] <manicennui> I could see mountains from my hotel room in downtown Asheville.
[06:22:10] <dimadima> very much like PNW or Colorado
[06:22:17] <manicennui> I liked the PNW a lot.
[06:22:22] <dimadima> me too...
[06:22:34] <manicennui> I had mixed feelings about Colorado.
[06:22:37] <dimadima> central / eastern oregon blew my mind
[06:22:40] <manicennui> It is definitely beautiful.
[06:22:49] <manicennui> But I knew as soon as I got home that I didn't want to live there.
[06:22:49] <dimadima> boulder was really really rich
[06:22:59] <manicennui> The Oregon coast is amazing.
[06:23:18] <manicennui> I didn't even go east of Portland when I was there.
[06:23:25] <manicennui> Only spent a few days there.
[06:23:35] <dimadima> i have never been to portland
[06:23:40] <dimadima> drove though on my way to california...
[06:23:42] <manicennui> Drove the coast and explored the city a bit.
[06:24:02] <dimadima> really nice
[06:24:35] <dimadima> looking forward to travelling out there and around the country again
[06:24:36] <manicennui> I don't know how people ever get tired of the mountains and the forests around them.
[06:25:04] <dimadima> i don't think they do
[06:25:16] <manicennui> Some people do.
[06:25:21] <dimadima> really?
[06:25:29] <manicennui> Anthony Bourdain visited Montana or something, and the people there didn't really care about the mountains.
[06:25:29] <dimadima> they want it flat?
[06:25:38] <manicennui> No, they just take it for granted.
[06:25:46] <dimadima> i guess people will do that
[06:25:49] <manicennui> They are more worried about day to day life.
[06:25:54] <dimadima> yeah
[06:26:41] <manicennui> I wonder what the plains looked like here.
[06:26:52] <dimadima> i've been guilty of that
[06:26:59] <dimadima> looked like? here?
[06:27:26] <dimadima> you've never driven west from chicago?
[06:27:50] <dimadima> i've had the fortune of doing that once
[06:27:52] <manicennui> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Chicago#/media/File:Chicago_in_1820.jpg
[06:27:52] <buttsbot> History of Chicago - Wikipedia
[06:28:04] <dimadima> oh like that yes
[06:28:07] <manicennui> You can drive west from Chicago for over an hour and it is just more suburbs.
[06:28:24] <manicennui> If you do get past the suburbs, it is huge monoculture farms.
[06:28:31] <dimadima> yeah
[06:28:37] <dimadima> we ruined the landscape
[06:28:47] <dimadima> and driving is driving
[06:29:04] <dimadima> and experience that's part and parcel of the ruining of the country
[06:29:23] <dimadima> that's a great painting or print!
[06:29:32] <dimadima> almost ironic
[06:29:39] <dimadima> or sarcastic or something
[06:30:18] <manicennui> Even small forests like the one that existed behind my childhood home in the suburbs are now just more housing.
[06:30:22] <manicennui> And strip malls.
[06:30:43] <dimadima> manhattan
[06:30:45] <dimadima> brooklyn
[06:30:49] <dimadima> queens
[06:30:57] <manicennui> I can't imagine arriving in North America 500 years ago and wanting to build more cities.
[06:31:34] <dimadima> why not?
[06:31:53] <manicennui> Because the natural beauty is astounding.
[06:32:50] <dimadima> https://cdm.bostonathenaeum.org/digital/collection/p13110coll5/id/3126
[06:32:51] <buttsbot> CONTENTdm
[06:33:15] <dimadima> yeah but fwiw cities and human-nature co-existence were different 500 years ago
[06:33:33] <dimadima> humans didn't tear interstates highways through continents back then
[06:35:01] <manicennui> One of my favorite things about watching Meat Eaters is when he goes to Alaska, far away from civilization.
[06:35:31] <manicennui> State and National parks are beautiful, but they always have a lot of man-made structures for tourists and such.
[06:35:42] <manicennui> Large parts of Alaska are completely wild.
[06:36:46] <dimadima> i've never seen Meat Eaters
[06:37:17] <manicennui> I like it a lot, and I'm not into hunting.
[06:37:47] <dimadima> it's a show?
[06:37:53] <dimadima> about hunting?
[06:38:07] <manicennui> Yes.
[06:38:18] <manicennui> And cooking.
[06:38:21] <dimadima> intense
[06:38:22] <manicennui> The dishes he makes look amazing.
[06:38:34] <manicennui> But he is always out in the most stunning areas.
[06:38:41] <manicennui> And he knows a ton about the animals and such.
[06:38:46] <dimadima> that's awesome

[06:39:29] <dimadima> i'm such a risk averse person with regard to nature
[06:39:58] <dimadima> it's not that i like the the comforts of civilization so much as i'm afraid of nature
[06:40:11] <dimadima> like wild nature
[06:40:37] <manicennui> I definitely like the comforts of civilization, but I also like to go out into nature for a few hours.
[06:40:41] <dimadima> i could never be one of these people who goes out into the wildness and does this or that
[06:40:48] <dimadima> yeah for a few hours for sure
[06:40:55] <dimadima> or a day or maybe even two
[06:41:03] <dimadima> i know a guy who's walked the appalacian trail many times
[06:41:21] <manicennui> Yeah, that is something I wish I had done.
[06:41:22] <dimadima> i could maybe do something like that. appalacia is pretty close to civilization. but then that is pretty imposing
[06:41:34] <manicennui> I'm sure I could do part of it now, but I'm getting old.
[06:41:41] <dimadima> alaska etc too scary
[06:41:49] <manicennui> I wish I had done like a week on the trail in my 20s.
[06:42:12] <dimadima> depending on your shape i imagine you could do something like that well into old age
[06:42:14] <manicennui> I could see myself doing some fly fishing now.
[06:42:17] <dimadima> in the right season
[06:42:22] <dimadima> if in good shape
[06:42:30] <manicennui> Sure. Maybe someday.
[06:42:33] <manicennui> I'm in terrible shape.
[06:42:48] <manicennui> Hoping that I'll get out more if I live near some trails.
[06:43:00] <dimadima> going to NC soon you said?
[06:43:11] <manicennui> Going next week for a week.
[06:43:19] <manicennui> It will be my second time there.
[06:43:22] <dimadima> that's so cool...
[06:43:25] <manicennui> Trying to decide what I want to do.
[06:43:42] <manicennui> Staying in a couple different places near Asheville.
[06:43:45] <manicennui> One of them is a farm.
[06:44:42] <dimadima> sounds really nice
[06:44:48] <dimadima> wish i could do that
[06:44:56] <dimadima> going with anyone?
[06:45:01] <manicennui> When I look back on my life, the things that I enjoyed the most all involved nature and/or being outdoors.
[06:45:12] <manicennui> We used to screw around in the woods behind our house.
[06:45:13] <dimadima> i have a sort of young child, haven't gone anywhere with him. can't imagine doing that even
[06:45:27] <manicennui> And I loved my grandmother's garden.
[06:45:47] <manicennui> Loved keeping freshwater planted aquariums.
[06:46:06] <dimadima> escape chicago!
[06:46:16] <dimadima> hehe
[06:46:19] <manicennui> I moved to the city and went to a lot of concerts, ate a lot of food, and drank a bit.
[06:46:31] <manicennui> Now I'm kind of done with it.
[06:46:55] <manicennui> The only way I could see staying here is if I buy a much nicer place where I can't hear my neighbors and have some outdoor space.
[06:47:08] <manicennui> My balcony here is tiny and in direct sun much of the day.
[06:47:48] <manicennui> I just can't see staying in a condo where I'll be paying an increasing association fee forever.
[06:47:52] <manicennui> And property taxes are so high here.
[06:48:12] <manicennui> And it's not as though we get anything for them.
[06:48:28] <dimadima> i lived in new york like 11 years and by the time we fled the pandemic i was pretty done with it. my wife was not and i felt/feel really bad for her
[06:48:31] <manicennui> IL, Cook County, and Chicago are just financially fucked.
[06:48:56] <dimadima> yeah living in a financially fucked concrete bunghole type place
[06:49:20] <manicennui> Honestly my biggest anxiety is about moving itself.
[06:49:23] <manicennui> And selling this place.
[06:49:26] <dimadima> that's the worst!
[06:49:38] <dimadima> that's all the anxiety and inertia
[06:49:39] <dimadima> righ there
[06:49:41] <manicennui> Yeah, I don't like dealing with things like that.
[06:49:44] <manicennui> I worry about every detail.
[06:49:56] <manicennui> And know that I'm going to have to hire people to do things who aren't going to do a good job.
[06:50:39] <manicennui> I also want to get rid of some furniture, and don't want to deal with that.
[06:54:04] <dimadima> yeah the pandemic and child situation really helped me overcome a ton of inertia, anxiety and analysis paralysis for me

[06:54:29] <dimadima> i've been trying to embrace the rich tapestry of human perfection and imperfection lately
[06:54:30] <manicennui> Having a partner must help.
[06:54:37] <manicennui> Assuming one of you can find some motivation.
[06:55:08] <dimadima> like as a human it it seems for sure that i need other humans and dealing with them is easier if done with a sort of observational persepctive
[06:55:19] <dimadima> as in like, detached
[06:55:41] <dimadima> because people will be really awesome and then some people will be totally good for nothing but you get through it
[06:55:46] <dimadima> yeah partner for sure
[06:56:10] <dimadima> but on the other hand w/o a partner i'd have little motivation to have, for example, left new york
[06:56:20] <dimadima> i don't know anyone single who left
[06:57:00] <dimadima> which is maybe more to what you were saying
[06:57:47] <manicennui> Well, some people are motivated and independent.
[06:57:52] <manicennui> I'm just independent.
[06:58:07] <manicennui> Complacent really.
[06:58:20] <manicennui> Nothing about my life is all that bad.
[06:59:01] *** Joins: klardotsh (~klardotsh@97-113-192-99.tukw.qwest.net)
[06:59:05] <manicennui> Having a second income would also make things easier.
[06:59:28] <dimadima> i've been working on a project for several years so we have one income, which has been roguh
[06:59:42] <manicennui> There are definitely cheaper places to live, but nothing that is both extremely cheap and not a dump.
[06:59:52] <dimadima> i am most likely going to get a job soon
[06:59:54] <manicennui> Or just way out in the middle of nowhere.
[07:00:23] <manicennui> Do you watch your kid while your wife works?
[07:00:34] <manicennui> The cost of childcare can make a second income worthless.
[07:00:51] <dimadima> my parents help out a couple hours a day and he sleeps a bunch and then i watch him or my wife watches him
[07:01:22] <dimadima> yeah ideally we'd get one solid income off me and she'd watch him
[07:01:28] <manicennui> Parents in NYC or they are where you moved to?
[07:01:33] <dimadima> that seems really luxe
[07:01:38] <dimadima> where i moved to
[07:01:48] <dimadima> i moved to where i was from, which is baltimore county
[07:01:52] <dimadima> we moved
[07:02:12] <manicennui> I assume that is where Baltimore is?
[07:02:28] <manicennui> I know very little about Maryland.
[07:02:32] <dimadima> yeah it's the county around baltimore
[07:02:57] <dimadima> maryland is cool. it's mid-atlantic east coast
[07:02:57] <manicennui> I've actually never been to NY nor New England.
[07:03:12] <dimadima> so it's all part of this megalopolis around here
[07:03:42] <dimadima> i'm really glad i got to live in new york
[07:03:45] <manicennui> Might have driven across the tip of Virginia at some point, but I've basically never been anywhere in the NE.
[07:03:50] <dimadima> and got to know it. it's a really cool place i think
[07:03:59] <dimadima> i've never been to boston
[07:04:04] <dimadima> only providence, ri
[07:04:10] <dimadima> and around the southern parts of cape code
[07:04:13] <manicennui> I think living in a major city is worth doing once in one's life.
[07:04:16] <dimadima> went to maine a few years ago from new york
[07:04:39] <dimadima> yeah it was a really good exprience over all
[07:04:41] <manicennui> I think I should have left 5+ years ago though.
[07:05:08] <manicennui> Now there are so many remote jobs that I have fewer roadblocks.
[07:05:27] <dimadima> what do you program?
[07:05:34] <dimadima> i'm assuming you're a programmer :)
[07:05:35] <manicennui> Ruby mostly.
[07:06:00] <manicennui> There is a good chance my employer would even let me go fully remote.
[07:06:15] <manicennui> So I might not even have to deal with switching jobs immediately.
[07:06:33] <dimadima> moving somewhere random like Chicago -> Asheville i have no idea how i would do
[07:06:45] <dimadima> i'm not even sure that not doing that can be billed as complacent
[07:06:55] <manicennui> I haven't done it yet.
[07:06:58] <dimadima> i guess people do that sort of thing, but w/o a job calling or something like that
[07:07:24] <manicennui> I figure this trip will help me decide.
[07:07:25] <dimadima> i don't think i would/could do that
[07:07:27] <dimadima> yeah
[07:07:29] <manicennui> Although I don't know why I wouldn't do it.
[07:07:50] <dimadima> if you can comfortably get people to put your stuff into a truck and unload it at the destination
[07:07:51] <manicennui> I keep thinking I'll just move to a better condo in a better area here and I'll like it more.
[07:07:53] <dimadima> comfortably meaning money wise
[07:08:01] <manicennui> But then I see a photograph of some outdoor area and I sigh.
[07:08:10] <manicennui> I have plenty of money.
[07:08:13] <dimadima> in terms of anxiety it doesn't have to be great
[07:08:30] <manicennui> I've been saving for years.
[07:08:39] <dimadima> putting your stuff into boxes is rough
[07:08:40] <manicennui> And when my current place sells I'll get a bit more.
[07:08:45] <dimadima> really not easy
[07:08:47] <manicennui> Yeah, because I'm lazy as hell.
[07:08:58] <manicennui> And I have a lot of clutter.
[07:09:29] <manicennui> We get bonuses and such in the early spring. I'll probably make a decision in the next month or so and then plan to move sometime next year.
[07:09:43] <manicennui> If I end up switching jobs I'll do it after bonuses.
[07:09:53] <manicennui> I also have some RSUs that will vest.
[07:10:20] <manicennui> But I might just ask to go fully remote at this place and deal with my job later.
[07:16:00] <dimadima> man
[07:17:03] <dimadima> nature will for sure provide more tranquility
[07:17:27] <dimadima> the in-home noise was something that bothered me a lot in new york
[07:18:11] <dimadima> the last place i lived i had a neighbor who left her small poofy white dog at home alone all day
[07:18:26] <dimadima> it barked for hours at a time, peed and stunk up the hall
[07:18:38] <dimadima> and it was sad
[07:18:56] <dimadima> untranquil
[07:20:15] <manicennui> I can hear conversations, televisions, and walking around.
[07:20:33] <manicennui> This place is an old building that was gut rehabbed, and they obviously did nothing between the floors.
[07:23:51] <dimadima> what kind of building it is
[07:23:54] <dimadima> originally
[07:24:08] <manicennui> They also installed the roof membrane incorrectly, so there was water damage that was repaired before I bought the place.
[07:24:18] <manicennui> It is a four-story courtyard building.
[07:24:47] <manicennui> Built in the early 20th century.
[07:25:08] <manicennui> It was always residential if that is what you are asking.
[07:25:10] <manicennui> Not repurposed.
[07:25:19] <manicennui> Just really old exterior.
[07:25:26] <manicennui> It looks nice.
[07:25:52] <dimadima> ah the chicago courtyard!
[07:26:07] <dimadima> a gut rehabbed condo in a chicago courtyard building

[07:30:39] <manicennui> My last place was also a courtyard build, but it had a nice brick balcony.
[07:30:43] <manicennui> building
[07:30:51] <manicennui> The courtyard wasn't very nice though.
[07:31:06] <dimadima> didn't know many of those were condos
[07:31:20] <dimadima> i guess that makes sense
[07:32:07] <manicennui> They are turning the Sears on Lawrence into condos.
[07:32:12] <manicennui> It is one of the first Sears locations.
[07:32:19] <dimadima> heh
[07:32:42] <manicennui> Kind of an ugly building with very few windows, but they are adding windows to it.

[07:36:31] <dimadima> heh!
[07:36:46] <manicennui> I do love these old buildings.
[07:36:52] <dimadima> yeah factories and warehouses from the early 1900s had tons of qindows
[07:36:57] <manicennui> But they never spend enough to properly retrofit them.
[07:37:06] <manicennui> Never enough insulation and such.
[07:37:36] <manicennui> My current place is incredibly cold along one wall in the winter.
[07:37:42] <manicennui> In addition to being able to hear my neighbors.
[07:38:04] <manicennui> They do a decent job on woodwork and such though.
[07:38:07] <manicennui> Unlike the suburbs.
[07:38:26] <manicennui> So much builder grade garbage in the suburbs.
[07:38:49] <manicennui> But if I had a house, I'd probably spend the money to insulate it better.
[07:39:12] <dimadima> yeah my dream is a stone house
[07:39:20] <dimadima> or with some solid bricks
[07:39:36] <manicennui> Do you watch all kinds of videos on YT about houses people have built/restored?
[07:39:47] <dimadima> or some kind of futurist geodesic thing but as long as its well insulated
[07:39:58] <manicennui> There are some really incredible stone buildings in Europe in rural areas that people have restored/remodeled.

[07:47:44] <dimadima> sadly no time to watch these now. they look really cool

[11:30:33] <quanticle> But I think the correct way to do it is to suck it up and actually go through the tickets and delete the ones that aren't important or relevant
[11:31:13] <quanticle> The mass delete and pray approach sounds attractive, but it assumes that the problems that are important are the most urgent
[11:31:51] <quanticle> i.e. you have a security bug that someone filed and forgot about, and after the delete the bug is gone and so the hole remains unpatched forever
[11:34:55] <manicennui> Pfft. As if we create security bug tickets.
[11:35:03] <quanticle> lol
[11:36:33] <manicennui> Most of our backlog is things we added a ticket for so people felt better and we will never do.
[11:36:56] <quanticle> Yeah, I think that's the sort of situation that this CTO stepped into
[11:37:05] <quanticle> Like, the backlog was a bunch of irrelevant BS
[11:37:14] <manicennui> We basically create tickets slightly faster than we complete them.
[11:37:24] <manicennui> And things that came up recently do tend to get pushed to the top.
[11:37:32] <manicennui> I gave up on fighting that shit.
[11:37:37] <manicennui> I get paid either way.
[11:37:54] <manicennui> And they understand that doing this will cause other things not to get done.
[11:38:04] <manicennui> I think that is the key thing missing at many companies.
[11:38:15] <manicennui> They want to add shit *and* still get the other shit in the same timeframe.
[11:38:33] <manicennui> I just tell them frequently that it's not going to happen, and they understand, and no one gets upset.
[11:39:19] <manicennui> I wish they'd stop pretending that we are doing sprints though and just switch to kanban, which is what we are doing anyways.
[11:39:30] <manicennui> I got them to agree to it about a year ago and everyone likes it.
[11:39:37] <manicennui> But we still do IPM and other nonsense.
[11:40:03] <manicennui> We have a grooming session once per week and we make sure we have enough work until the next grooming session.
[11:40:24] <manicennui> No one cares about the burndown.
[11:49:30] <quanticle> Yeah, honestly, no one cares about the backlog as long as the features that the PMs want are getting delivered

[14:46:49] <Brekkjern> AFAIK
[15:08:29] <Brekkjern> gerikson: If the question was "How do you muck with shit in the pipeline" then this is something I did last week:
[15:08:29] <Brekkjern> PS #> (docker images --format "{{.Size}}" | % {$Suffix = $_.substring($_.length - 2, 2); [int32]$Size = $_.substring(0, $_.length - 2); $Size * $Sizes[$Suffix]} | Measure-Object -Sum | Select -ExpandProperty Sum) / 1GB
[15:08:29] <Brekkjern> 28.5518712997437
[15:09:04] <Brekkjern> It's a bit... wonky, but that's because Docker "helpfully" formats the data for you
[15:09:42] <Brekkjern> A lot of the commands could have been shortened though. I just used tab completion for them
[15:11:28] <Geekingfrog> how does docker work on windows?
[15:14:37] <Brekkjern> Linux VM running on Hyper-V
[15:15:05] <Brekkjern> The docker client just connects through TCP to the daemon running on the VM
[15:18:27] <Brekkjern> That example up there isn't really all that great either as I'm not really doing much with the data other than unfucking the formatting so I can see the total size of all the images

[15:29:57] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: re reimplementing Powershell earlier: yup, really silly, but this is how some feel everything should work
[15:30:43] <river> I don't think powershell is the solution though
[15:30:56] <river> it doesn't have a interchange format
[15:31:00] <Brekkjern> It's sure as hell better than bash
[15:31:10] <Brekkjern> What do you mean "interchange format"?
[15:31:12] <river> you can serialize and deserialize in various formats, but they're all second hand
[15:31:21] <river> like a textual format
[15:31:32] <gwozniak> manicennui: we do some cheap version of kanban here because we know backlogs and burndowns are a joke
[15:32:07] <river> in unix you pass data between process but in powershell it's all dlls right? they aren't individual processes
[15:32:21] <gwozniak> Powershell seems very interchangable to me, and I've barely used it
[15:32:28] <river> oh am I wrong?
[15:33:24] <Brekkjern> The pipeline is a single process, yes (well... with multithreading and paralell processing support)
[15:34:39] <Brekkjern> But pwsh does have builtin conversion from/to csv, html, json,and xml
[15:35:12] <Brekkjern> So you could easily grab any object you are working on and chuck it through conversion before feeding it to a process
[15:35:37] <Geekingfrog> how would it work to add commands to integrate with powershell? For example, a docker2 which instead of outputting text stuff, it outputs powershell objects that you can use more naturally.
[15:35:56] <Brekkjern> Geekingfrog: You mean a module?
[15:36:04] * Geekingfrog knows nothing about powershell
[15:36:27] <Brekkjern> Heh
[15:36:39] <Geekingfrog> I'm going to see if my corporate overlord is open to swap my mac for a windows laptop. I figure it's going to be easier to run some linux vm there (or just wsl?)

[15:55:52] <river> how am I to interpret this thing about fire drills
[15:56:51] <gwozniak> I'm pretty sure it's a non-issue
[15:58:19] <gwozniak> I'm also pretty sure he doesn't want to talk about it because it's a non-issue and likely ended up consuming a lot of his time
[15:58:45] <river> well i just wanted a 'yes' or 'no' but he typed a lot more than 3 letters
[15:59:59] <gwozniak> High certainty the answer is "no" because "it doesn't need to be patched"
[16:01:07] <gwozniak> As in, it was never a problem in the first place
[16:01:11] <river> I see, would be good to get a confirmation
[16:01:24] <gwozniak> push confirmed it in that comment, I think
[16:01:50] <gwozniak> at least to me, that's the end of it
[16:01:51] <river> I don't think he, push is talking about a second more serious vulnerability regarding session cookies that he got the idea of from the password reset attack
[16:01:55] <river> think so*
[16:02:33] <river> and his post explains that the session cookie thing ended up not being a vulnerability, but nothing on the original password reset attack
[16:03:19] <gwozniak> Also doubt that is a problem
[16:03:45] <gwozniak> But I don't know and, frankly, don't care very much
[16:05:57] <gwozniak> I have not read the original post and have heard nothing about the password reset attack, aside from the timing aspect

[20:44:27] <prussian> indigo: ya, I mean, I did I guess. It just seems like I'm wage thefting at this point. I still have no clue I go through a performance review with zero problems.
[20:44:31] <manicennui> And it leads to people being extra toxic.
[20:44:44] <dasm> i'm starting a game just to chill out. i don't like being called dipshit or anything like that :)
[20:44:57] <manicennui> Yeah.
[20:45:08] <manicennui> I don't understand why these people play.
[20:45:16] <dasm> hence i'm playing single player games. my the most favorite Spec Ops The Line. It's very linear, but the story...
[20:45:28] <manicennui> I'm generally in the middle ranks. None of us are going pro.
[20:45:37] <manicennui> And none of the pros spent years in the middle ranks.
[20:46:50] <Brekkjern> I don't expect people to play like pros when I play ranked/competitive modes, but I do expect them to play to win and not goof off.
[20:47:28] <Brekkjern> If you just wanna have fun and use shit weapons/strategies for fun, then... don't do it in comp?
[20:49:51] <manicennui> Yes, but OW also has multiple modes.
[20:49:59] <manicennui> And role queue is considered the "super serious" mode.
[20:50:16] <manicennui> Open queue specifically doesn't enforce roles, but people will get pissed if it isn't 2/2/2.
[20:50:35] <manicennui> The whole 2/2/2 thing was instituted because Blizzard wanted to control team composition in OWL.
[20:50:46] <manicennui> They hated that people found weird comps that worked.
[20:51:56] <manicennui> But there is just no good reason to become angry, period.
[20:53:58] <manicennui> I think we just accept people becoming angry over stupid shit instead of calling it what it is: immaturity, insecurity, and possible mental illness.
[20:54:29] <manicennui> At some point you need to learn to deal with situations you don't like without becoming an asshole.
[20:54:37] <manicennui> Or seek help.
[20:58:33] <Brekkjern> The definition of being an asshole differs depending on the expected social contract of the people interacting with each other
[20:58:55] <Brekkjern> If you are playing a competitive mode and goofing off, you are breaching that social contract and being an asshole
[20:59:14] <Brekkjern> Sure, you are not verbally being an asshole, but you are ruining the fun for everyone else
[20:59:57] <Brekkjern> If you don't want to play competitively, avoid the competitive modes
[21:00:36] <indigo> prussian: If you go through performance reviews with no problems, then how can you be wage thefting
[21:02:25] <manicennui> Brekkjern: 1. Everyone has different expectations in a game. "Competitive" means nothing. It's just a mode. 2. Again, someone doing something you disagree with does not justify your being an asshole.
[21:02:40] <manicennui> At most I'll ask if they play some other character, nicely.
[21:02:47] <manicennui> If they don't do it, I just move on.
[21:02:50] <manicennui> It's a damn game.
[21:03:02] <manicennui> You are not actually competing for anything.
[21:03:37] <ngoldbaum> pvp is srs buziness
[21:03:50] <manicennui> And a large portion of the time the people bitching about other players are wrong about what needs to change, or they are the ones playing poorly.
[21:03:53] <manicennui> So it's all dumb.
[21:04:00] <Xe> Well, I'm buying a car
[21:04:45] <ngoldbaum> settling into ontario i see
[21:05:23] <Xe> A used 2020 Mazda CX-30 All-wheel drive
[21:05:34] <Xe> White body, black trim
[21:15:29] *** Joins: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess)
[21:28:11] <prussian> Xe: looks lit.
[21:28:43] <prussian> and here I am wondering if I *need* a F-150 Raptor. (I don't)
[21:34:28] <Xe> I just bought a car
[21:35:17] <prussian> that quick?
[21:35:18] <prussian> damn
[21:42:00] <manicennui> prussian: Maybe the upcoming Raptorized Bronco.
[21:42:12] <manicennui> https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a37001912/2023-ford-bronco-raptor/#:~:text=Jul%2013%2C%202021,150%20of%20the%20same%20name.
[21:42:13] <buttsbot> 2023 Ford Bronco Raptor: Everything We Know
[21:42:15] <prussian> hahaha. BRONCO RAPTOR
[21:42:25] <prussian> feels like they keep pushing up the release date
[21:42:52] <dasm> why is it 2023? aren't we still in 2021?
[21:43:05] <prussian> not gonna lie. that car camo not only sucks, the car looks awful
[21:43:06] <dasm> i know that covid destroyed 2020... but, come one.. i still feel like 2019
[21:43:33] <prussian> I remember driving up PCH 1 and seeing much more elaborate camo.
[21:43:38] <prussian> dasm: this
[21:44:26] <prussian> manicennui: I just think about the 60-80 grand I'd piss away for a neat car and then realize, I really don't need it.
[21:44:33] <manicennui> I do wish they would have leaned into the classic Bronco look a bit more, but some of them look pretty damn good.
[21:44:39] <prussian> and then getting a big ass property tax bill in the mail for it too lol
[21:44:45] <manicennui> prussian: YOLO
[21:44:50] <prussian> ya I guess..
[21:44:57] <manicennui> Oh, not in the US?
[21:45:00] <prussian> I do need, or at least would like a Truck.
[21:45:11] <prussian> manicennui: Connecitcut towns do property taxes on cars.
[21:45:15] <prussian> ya..
[21:45:16] <prussian> it sucks
[21:45:20] <prussian> as much as it sounds.
[21:46:11] <prussian> even my semi new shitbox Toyota Corolla was $400 in property taxes this year. I hope this chip shortage thing doesn't make the value magically jump up back to like 700
[21:50:49] <drakonis> https://mirror.fro.wtf/reddit/post/3206012
[21:50:49] <buttsbot> American guy being detained for wearing Russian flag t-shirt in Odessa, Ukraine
[21:50:56] <drakonis> lmao americans
[21:50:59] <drakonis> this guy was stirring shit
[21:51:23] <drakonis> what a moron, he definitely had it coming
[21:51:38] <gerikson> "AM I BEING DETAINED?!" - Da
[21:53:38] <manicennui> prussian: On the one hand I support such taxes to discourage people owning more cars, but at the same time, one cannot live without a car in most of the US, and I don't support making it even harder for the average person to survive.
[21:53:56] <drakonis> gerikson: every second of it is just
[21:53:58] <drakonis> :chefkiss:
[21:54:39] <prussian> manicennui: such is life. the supremest of ironies is my neighbor has property in New Hampshire, so his cars are all registered there anyway, thus avoiding the property tax altogether.
[21:54:53] <prussian> so basically, ya. it's a regressive tax for the most part.
[21:55:16] <manicennui> drakonis: I don't support detaining people for wearing shirts that they don't like.
[21:55:19] <prussian> much like all the taxes they are trying to shove in. hard world.
[21:55:23] <drakonis> watch the video
[21:55:26] <drakonis> my gu
[21:55:29] <drakonis> guy
[21:55:58] <drakonis> manicennui: instead of reading the title and commenting, watch the video
[21:56:27] <manicennui> prussian: I don't understand why we don't exempt people making less than a certain amount from almost all taxes.
[21:56:54] <manicennui> Seems like it would also reduce the need for various forms of welfare to a small extent.
[21:56:59] <prussian> the sort of "skin in the game" sort of argument is the best I can figure, plus defining wealth is hard. income isn't all the things.
[21:57:44] <manicennui> Also not a big fan of property tax in general, especially on things that are essential to living, like housing and transportation.
[21:57:52] <prussian> plus we have towns like Hartford where it is all Property Tax Exempt or disproportionately poor so they find it hard to collect tax
[21:58:02] <manicennui> It's crazy to me that we still allow people to be taxed out of their homes.
[21:58:33] <manicennui> It serves to move more property into the hands of those with wealth too.
[21:58:38] <prussian> I suppose the upside is, forces you to be productive member of society to ideally "free" that land for better economic use
[21:58:41] <manicennui> Bad consequences all around.
[21:58:53] <prussian> true...
[21:58:56] <prussian> idk man
[21:59:06] <manicennui> prussian: If you worked for 30 years and paid off your house, you shouldn't lose it because some tech bros move into the area.
[21:59:42] <prussian> idk man
[21:59:48] <manicennui> Everything in the US seems designed with the intent of concentrating wealth.
[21:59:58] <prussian> I can "see" what the argument for that is, I don't know if it is right or wrong though.
[22:00:11] <prussian> yes.
[22:00:34] <prussian> I sometimes wonder if the middle class is a sort of historical fluke
[22:00:57] <manicennui> We were in a very unique position after WW2.
[22:01:04] <manicennui> All other industrialized countries were in shambles.
[22:01:16] <gerikson> not Sweden ;)
[22:01:22] <gerikson> we had it fucking *good*
[22:02:53] <ngoldbaum> and so we got saab
[22:02:57] <ngoldbaum> was nice while it lasted
[22:03:09] <manicennui> And IKEA!
[22:03:21] <manicennui> "Founded in Sweden in 1943 by 17-year-old Ingvar Kamprad"
[22:04:11] <manicennui> Japan and Germany did manage to recover eventually and become big players again.
[22:04:29] <manicennui> The lesson that Americans seemed to learn is, "We should go to war more."
[22:04:57] <manicennui> You'll even see this used as an excuse for the money we spend on wars.
[22:05:41] <manicennui> Meanwhile we moved millions of those jobs to cheaper countries.
[22:07:39] <prussian> and thus enriched them. in their own way.
[22:07:47] <prussian> and the cycle continues.
[22:08:04] <prussian> I don't know if war is good though. seems like most places struggle hard after.
[22:08:14] <prussian> like the whole Eritrea/Ethiopia saga
[22:08:33] <prussian> which I guess Ethiopia is having some ethnic civil war problem.
[22:08:37] <prussian> currently
[22:09:12] <manicennui> War is obviously not good, but once in a while necessary.
[22:09:27] <manicennui> It's hard to justify most of the wars we've been in since WW2.

[22:34:48] <gerikson> I wonder what Korea had been like if Kim had managed to conquer the entire peninsula
[22:35:10] <gerikson> I mean he was very close
[22:37:41] <manicennui> The question there is whether we had any business getting involved.
[22:38:04] <manicennui> I'm not a big fan of our world police attitude.
[22:38:17] <gerikson> so vote against it ;)
[22:38:17] <manicennui> And you know it had more to do with being anti-communist than giving a shit about Koreans.

[22:39:39] <bkero> Falun Gong
[22:39:49] <manicennui> I think the best argument against the world police angle is that it rarely works out well.
[22:40:15] <gerikson> fascinating reading in view of Afghanistan
[22:41:49] <gerikson> ``The tacit assumption was that the U.S. owned China, by right, along with most of the rest of the world, much as postwar planners assumed.''
[22:41:56] <gerikson> hah!
[22:42:01] <cb> being world police is better if it stops fighting rather than creates more
[22:42:19] <gerikson> manicennui: in light of that debate, there was no way the US was gonna "lose" another country to Communism
[22:46:49] <gerikson> manicennui: but yeah, it's fucked up that internal political stuff in the US affects the rest of the world

[22:49:30] <gerikson> ``After a few months of learning the Rails way, I started to realize something... I felt lazy, before I used to learn new skills for at least 4 hours/day (after working 8 hours). ''
[22:52:04] <manicennui> I can relate to the sentiment, although I hit this point long ago.
[22:52:19] <manicennui> And Rails really does just work in most cases.
[22:52:33] <manicennui> And a lot of the problems with it are bad programmers doing dumb crap.
[22:52:48] <manicennui> Or feeling the need to complicate things.
[22:53:30] <manicennui> We've rewritten our frontend code multiple times while I've worked at this company, and we have gained nothing other than the visual refresh which is always done at the same time.
[22:53:54] <manicennui> Several of my coworkers act as though Vue components are some quantum leap beyond Rails partials, but they really aren't.
[22:55:01] <manicennui> I forget where I saw this quote, but paraphrasing, "This time we'll find the discipline that we have never had before!"
[22:56:22] <klardotsh> a level beyond "The Rails Way" levels of not-having-to-think-about-it, I've grown over the past two years to appreciate projects like Postgraphile that just... auto-reflect a DB schema and expose reasonable APIs from it. There's "don't really think about it", then there's "don't think about it at all"
[22:56:53] <klardotsh> 80/20 obviously still applies but for the 80% case, man. it was a life changer.
[22:58:03] <prussian> solution... RIIR
[22:58:08] <prussian> hmm
[22:58:09] <prussian> RIIR

[22:58:55] <ngoldbaum> buttsbot: you ok bruv
[22:58:55] <manicennui> Rust is a solution to a problem that most of us don't have.
[22:58:58] <Brekkjern> Yeah. You guys complained so much...
[22:59:10] <prussian> we have to go back to https://github.com/azac/cobol-on-wheelchair

[22:59:15] <prussian> beautiful...
[22:59:44] <Brekkjern> I'd code up some backoff algorithm or something, but I really can't be arsed to wrangle with the go code to do that
[22:59:57] <prussian> so true.
[23:00:09] <prussian> not worth the hassle
[23:02:50] <manicennui> Wow. Nigella Lawson is going to be on Philosophy Tube.
[23:04:23] <bkero> The lady who can't cook ramen?
[23:11:06] <manicennui> It's possible I'm missing a joke and it is actually going to be Abigail impersonating her.

[23:12:12] <manicennui> Why not COVIDDESTROYER!!!
[23:12:15] <ngoldbaum> which just implies that pfizer *could* have come up with a better name, let alone one that pronounceable without looking at it sideways
[23:12:47] <manicennui> Maybe they can give it a name that will trick Republicans into getting it.

[23:16:27] <indigo> And they booed him
[23:17:29] <manicennui> Yes.
[23:17:45] <manicennui> I think they also cheered the Taliban.

[23:18:30] <prussian> idk. I just watched the "reaction." didn't seem that intense?
[23:18:33] <manicennui> After tearing into President Joe Biden for what he described as allowing “weakness in the White House,” Trump went on to boast of his chummy relations with the Taliban, who he described as “great negotiators” and “tough fighters,” insisting that “with me in office the Taliban would not have ever dreamt of capturing our air field or parading around with our American weapons.”
[23:20:05] <manicennui> prussian: Yeah, it's just more of the focusing on dumb things really.
[23:20:38] <prussian> ah, trump. never ceases to say inane things.
[23:20:42] <manicennui> Democrats should be focused on the fact that people aren't thrilled with the job they are doing.
[23:20:48] <manicennui> And winning more seats in 2022.
[23:21:10] <prussian> true.
[23:21:18] <manicennui> Democrats seem to do best when they have someone they are against.
[23:21:24] <manicennui> They don't really have that now.
[23:21:37] <manicennui> They have control of both chambers and the presidency.
