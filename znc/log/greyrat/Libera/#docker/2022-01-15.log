[17:32:06] <luc4> Hello! Does "docker-compose up -d" stop/remove/create a container when a newer version is available locally? It seems I'm noticing a difference when doing just "docker-compose up -d" and manually stop/rm.
[17:34:56] <larsks> `docker-compose up` will re-use existing containers if they exist. If you want the containers refreshed (e.g., with new images), you would need to remove them either by first running `docker-compose down` (which removes containers) or by manually removing them.
[17:37:27] <luc4> larsks: mmh... I'm not sure this is what I meant... Let's say I have a container running version 1. I docker-compose pull, and version 2 is downloaded. Then I "docker-compose up -d". What I see is that it recreates that container and runs version 2. Is this correct?
[17:38:35] <luc4> larsks: sorry, in my example, I'm using tag "latest", which changed from 1 to 2.
[17:40:08] <luc4> larsks: so docker-compose finds that the image changed, and it says "recreating". In that case, is it supposed to be "internally" equivalent to "stopping/removing/recreating" the container?
[17:42:04] <larsks> Ah, I think I misunderstood your earlier message. I believe you are correct, although I'd have to check to be sure and I need to run at the moment.

I created a similar setup and I did some tests. It seems that if I "docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d" and a new version of the image is downloaded and run, wordpress did not update. While if I stop the container, removed the container and I run it again, it actually updates.
[17:44:44] <luc4> I can't even think how this is possible...
[17:46:02] <luc4> By "updates", I mean that in the dashboard I can see that the reported version is the same version of the container.

[18:17:08] <luc4> larsks: yes, I confirm... for some reason, even though wordpress 5.8.1 container is running, the php files inside the container are of another different version. I really did not expect this.
[18:17:43] <luc4> maybe those are stored in a volume or something...
[18:37:54] <tabakhase> luc4 those wordpress images are between evil and dangerous...
[18:38:11] <tabakhase> -> phpcode is "data" for them so the wordpress-installation sits entirely in a volume
[18:38:40] <tabakhase> only on "very first boot" it installes itself (from some hidden folder in /usr/src/)
[18:39:41] <luc4> tabakhase: yes, I found this. My guess is that --renew-anon-volumes may be what I'm looking for.
[18:39:52] <tabakhase> so you may update the image and with that apache/php, but "the code" is on your own (so then normal wp update, wpcli, manual or whatever)
[18:40:24] <tabakhase> you dont just want to "renew" that either - as then your WP is gone :D ((it may keep parts in the DB yes, but addons, themes, plugins and so on is all "code"
[18:40:25] <luc4> tabakhase: the problem is that updating the image is not updating php code
[18:41:01] <luc4> tabakhase: no, my wp-content is mounted from the filesystem
[18:41:55] <luc4> tabakhase: the problem is that after an update with docker-compose I find myself with the previous php code
[18:42:00] <tabakhase> bindmount or volume kinda ends up the same here ye - both "is not a first boot" so it will not touch sourcecode ever
[18:42:32] <luc4> tabakhase: it should recreate what is outside wp-content though
[18:43:12] <luc4> tabakhase: but I find myself with WP 5.8.1, and inside /var/www/html I have php code from version 5.8.0
[18:43:26] <tabakhase> luc4 na its pretty much looking for "anything" https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/blob/fbc4dd7593dd0cf7a239348cb7ebcdcbf505286f/latest/php7.4/apache/docker-entrypoint.sh#L28

[19:22:43] <luc4> tabakhase: I'm not developing plugins. I'm simply trying to make the update of wordpress controlled by the container itself.
[19:23:08] <tabakhase> luc4 well everything in this compose-file - what shouldnt be much more than wp and maybe its db what you supposedly want to throw away then anyhow
[19:23:46] <luc4> tabakhase: no, there are many other services, why should I want to turn those down for no reason?
[19:24:31] <luc4> tabakhase: bah... I'm not an expert, but it seems broken according to the description in the manual

[19:25:14] <tabakhase> <I'm simply trying to make the update of wordpress controlled by the container itself.>  then you should go back to the very start - and take what the readme of this image says "The default configuration for this image matches the official WordPress defaults in which automatic updates are enabled (so the initial install comes from the image, but after that it becomes self-managing within the 
[19:25:15] <tabakhase> /var/www/html/ data volume)."

[19:25:37] <luc4> "Recreate anonymous volumes instead of retrieving data from the previous containers"... why should it recreate 20 other containers that has nothing to do with the changed container...
[19:26:00] <luc4> tabakhase: which is exactly what I do not want
[19:26:15] <luc4> tabakhase: if the container is version 5.8.1, that is the version I want
[19:26:17] <tabakhase> th alternative to this is also described there (and includes modding apache as there is "no way to unset a VOLUME" under the "Static image / updates-via-redeploy" section https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress
[19:26:50] <luc4> tabakhase: yes, I read that. But then I read this: https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/issues/156#issuecomment-419246648
[19:27:07] <luc4> tabakhase: which seemed more reasonable to me
[19:27:22] <tabakhase> "the wordpress-installer in this image may be 5.8.1, but with a preexisting /var/www/html the installer is not executed."
[19:28:09] <luc4> what "preexisting /var/www/html"? There is no such directory anywhere.
[19:28:49] <tabakhase> the annon volume enforced by https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/blob/fbc4dd7593dd0cf7a239348cb7ebcdcbf505286f/latest/php7.4/apache/Dockerfile#L160
[19:29:07] <luc4> tabakhase: exactly. I want that killed.
[19:30:09] <luc4> that is the reason why I found that "renew" flag
