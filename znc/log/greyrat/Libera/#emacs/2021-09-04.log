[23:29:56] <euouae> the_tubular for what vanilla emacs does, look at the emacs manual. After many years of using emacs, I have resorted to using Doom Emacs to get the fancy features

[23:37:45] <contrapunctus> I migrated a lot of Chronometrist backend code today to use EIEIO. Now what used to be `(get-foo)` is now `(get-foo (current-backend))`, all across the codebase. I suppose I could write wrappers, but that means a whole lot more definitions (albeit tiny ones). An alternative way might be to make the backend argument optional with a default value of `(current-backend)` - it might work, but I'm afraid it

[23:46:03] *** Joins: Aurora_v_kosmose (~LispyLigh@user/lispylights)
[23:46:18] <euouae> contrapunctus you would set up a global variable, and get-foo would have an optional with default the global variable
[23:46:55] <euouae> That is one approach, and it's better than having the default value be (current-backend), unless you need to call that every time? In which case the defautl variable should be a lambda that returns that result
