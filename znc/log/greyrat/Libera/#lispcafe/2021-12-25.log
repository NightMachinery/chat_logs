[01:14:58] <GreaseMonkey> heh, speaking of keyboards, i got a JP keyboard for christmas
[01:15:16] <GreaseMonkey> OADG layout or something like that, although convincing mozc to actually use the right keys is proving a challenge
[01:16:12] <GreaseMonkey> i'll need to manually edit configs whereever they are
[01:17:29] <GreaseMonkey> one notable plus side of this layout, however, is caps lock is... not caps lock unless you hold shift, it's alphanumeric mode
[01:18:33] <shka> i don't usually have capslock on my keyboards at all
[01:18:40] <shka> i remap it to extra escape
[01:18:59] <shka> and use both shifts at the same time for the capslock
[01:19:19] <GreaseMonkey> i guess that's the main diff between an emacs user and a vi user: what key does caps lock get remapped to
[01:19:29] <shka> heh, yea
[01:19:32] <shka> yeah
[01:20:02] <shka> i actually used to map caps to control and left control to escape 
[01:20:15] <shka> but on redox control is under a thumb already 
[01:20:53] <GreaseMonkey> if i fail at getting the kana key to work with mozc i could consider mapping that to esc, it's handy for my thumb
[01:21:15] <GreaseMonkey> but eh, i'm pretty used to smashing the top left of my keyboard

[02:47:13] <GreaseMonkey> continuous integration makes sure you can always build the thing and that it passes tests, continuous delivery i think drops stuff straight onto a staging environment when it passes tests, continuous deployment goes the extra step: if it passes all tests and deploys OK onto staging, then it goes straight into production

[08:12:15] <dave0> i rang my mum
[08:12:23] <dave0> she's having a quiet xmas
[08:18:26] <hayley> I wonder if I can expect the OpenCL compiler to move out loop-independent crap. If your compiler is broken, all the GPU in the world probably wouldn't help.f
[08:24:32] <White_Flame> I would hope so.  OpenCL is all about speed, after all
[08:35:15] <hayley> Hopefully that applies to e.g. for (int id = 0; id < min(limits[n], something_else); i++) ... too.
[08:36:46] <White_Flame> trust the compile
[08:36:47] <White_Flame> r
[08:40:53] <epony> "on trusting trust"  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflections_on_Trusting_Trust#Compiler_backdoors
[08:41:12] <epony> you can't even trust recursion
[08:41:37] <epony> (if you can't others can not be convinced)
[08:41:56] <epony> one "can", but everyone "only when it is trusty"
[08:43:23] <epony> a mutable compiler therefore is.. an interesting challenge
[08:44:06] <dave0> afaik lisp lets you extend it's compiler
[08:44:19] <dave0> it's no challenge, it's already done
[08:45:03] <hayley> Not exactly. There are macros but you can't portably e.g. add an optimisation pass to a compiler, unless you manage to do it as a source->source transform.
[08:45:08] <epony> so, is ideal for kleptocracy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptography#Construction
[08:45:29] <epony> ^ crypto-currencies fail
[08:54:48] <hayley> It's nice that eazy-opencl only offers finalizers for freeing GPU memory, because it's not like you do all the work on the GPU and thus barely cons, and never call the GC. 
[08:55:52] <epony> GPU's should be ideal for running virtual machines cause they have now Gigs of fast RAM
[08:56:29] <epony> like 1GB is a common low end discrete card and most are 2GB already
[08:56:53] <epony> they have 40-80 streaming CPU cores at minimum
[08:57:30] <epony> however nobody is insane to have the GPU drivers work in virtual machines
[08:57:56] <epony> so.. something is incorrect with that combination, and it's not only the trust, it's the SPEEED penalty
[08:58:17] <epony> as much as C++ is hated..
[08:59:10] <epony> a subset of it with ASM inline is how it's done, and with monstrous code generation attrocities for consumer models that are just absurd
[09:07:06] <hayley> Well, I just managed to kill my GPU driver, but had chunking seemingly working for a short whie.
[09:07:44] <hayley> ...but restarting X fixed it. That's new.
[09:10:23] <hayley> ...but now any time I try to copy to the GPU, it hangs for a while and then ruins my framebuffer.
[09:14:45] <epony> strange, can it be GPU memory problem or a hosed region in main memory?
[09:15:11] <epony> or has this been happening before.. and is it an integrated GPU?
[09:15:30] <GreaseMonkey> i once attempted to write a PS1 emulator in GLSL, which took about 20 seconds to compile, and wasn't particularly fast at all
[09:15:49] <GreaseMonkey> i also made a CHIP-8 emulator in GLSL, which was notably better than the PS1 emulator attempt and worked pretty well
[09:16:24] <hayley> It seems the MNIST neural network demo hammers OpenCL somehow, in a way that just testing something like (Î± #'+ 1 #(2 3 4)) doesn't.
[09:16:32] <GreaseMonkey> my experience has been that even with Intel GPUs where the individual cores are quite grunty, but nevertheless not numerous, an individual GPU core is not particularly fast
[09:17:44] <GreaseMonkey> anyway it's possible your GPU is wedged hard enough that it won't actually recover without rebooting your system
[09:17:47] <GreaseMonkey> so, uhh, do that
[09:18:02] <hayley> It's back to normal after killing X. No difference if I reboot or not.
[09:18:15] <GreaseMonkey> ...what
[09:18:16] <epony> probably just a driver bug
[09:18:39] <epony> or a model specific peculiarity
[09:18:50] <hayley> Better than running a kernel that doesn't stop, because you can't reboot as the GPU stops it somehow.
[09:19:00] <hayley> Even after killing SBCL, and logging out.
[09:19:26] <hayley> Maybe I should look at an on-CPU OpenCL implementation, so that it won't hose so much.
[09:19:39] <GreaseMonkey> that would be a sensible idea
[09:19:51] <hayley> Ironic, but would reduce lossage and hopefully would give me a "CORRUPTION WARNING: bruh wtf u doing" error instead of dying.
[09:21:15] <GreaseMonkey> Welcome to LDB, a low-level debugger for the Lisp runtime environment.
[09:21:15] <GreaseMonkey> ldb> 
[09:21:24] <hayley> Lovely, now C++ fucking dies with std::bad_alloc.
[09:22:23] <hayley> Now I wonder how eazy-opencl ever got published, when it goes up in flames, no matter how much I work around it being bad. 
[09:22:56] <GreaseMonkey> was it designed for NVidia's drivers by any chance?
[09:23:06] <epony> isn't the easy part in the name indicative ;-)
[09:23:11] <hayley> Not sure how that would happen.
[09:23:26] * hayley runs GC
[09:23:34] <hayley> "Process inferior-lisp user defined signal 2"
[09:23:54] <GreaseMonkey> i mean honestly if you wanted to spell it as "eazy", it should be an implementation of euphroria, just so you can call it "eazy-e"
[09:25:18] <hayley> Ironically for hayleyware, Petalisp does explicit memory management, and so the scheduler calls my code to allocate and deallocate. Thus having a FREE-GPU-ARRAY would be very nice.
[09:26:34] * hayley contemplates writing hard-opencl
[09:27:25] <epony> I've forgotten what a fast computer really was..
[09:27:36] <hayley> There's a Hard Chat and a Hard Quiz on TV here (and I've been in the audience for the latter twice).

[09:28:16] -ixelp- Hard Chat with Kevin Rudd | The Weekly - YouTube
[09:34:43] <hayley> Maybe I should attach gdb and see what the C++ code is doing.
[09:37:22] <hayley> Well, it appears one thread is in a POCL kernel and hasn't finished. Interesting!
[09:44:51] <hayley> Now it works, but it still seems slow.
[09:52:11] <hayley> 85.6% of time spent in MAKE-GPU-ARRAY. So it was allocation all along.

[14:41:21] <hayley> Anyone else seen the new Matrix movie? I thought it was fine, a bit crap in places, but still fine.
[14:41:41] <dave0> how was the new morpheus?
[14:42:04] <shka> hayley: i honestly didn't even like the old matrix movies that much
[14:42:05] <hayley> .oO(Damn, this phone doesn't have a switch to stop autocorrecting my swearing.)
[14:42:11] <shka> are action scenes good at least?
[14:42:42] <hayley> You only get to do bullet time for the first time once.
[14:43:26] <hayley> Still, fine. I didn't find it bad, but the action scenes felt like same olde.
[14:44:27] <hayley> (The start made me think there would be metacircularity to be had, but the movie didn't go that way.)
[14:44:37] <dave0> i remember the phones from the first matrix, everyone had one
[14:44:48] <dave0> and morpheus sunglasses
[14:45:21] <hayley> Not so many phones or sunglasses. Oh, and the Morpheus is interesting.
[14:46:42] <shka> i always had a problem with matrix 
[14:47:14] <shka> they could do anything they want in that setting, and yet they decided be so conservative 
[14:47:32] <shka> feels like a wasted opportunity honestly 
[15:03:50] <shka> it was fine for the first movie, but they could move in other direction after that
[15:05:17] <pl> I think Matrix didn't engage me in terms of plot so much because I've read at least one short story that was effectively the same setting few years before Matrix
[15:05:25] <pl> (written back in ~1970s or so?)
[15:06:32] <epony> yes.. 25 years later  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_(1995_film)

[15:57:25] <selwyn> well ymmv

[15:57:50] <pl> no fucking idea about americans in that set
[15:57:51] <epony> there is ;-) the most accurate English is, what the BBC talks
[15:58:11] <selwyn> i have heard scottish quite a lot
[15:58:12] <epony> (received pronunciation is a bit too pretentiuos)
[15:58:26] <selwyn> i suspect they meant 'highland english'
[15:58:28] *** Joins: random-nick (~random-ni@87.116.167.125)
[15:58:30] <pl> but Oxford accent is very well known over the world due to prevalence of teaching materials from there
[15:58:35] <epony> you get good English in Slavic countries
[15:58:43] <pl> *ahem*
[15:58:55] <epony> ;-) it's true

[16:00:26] <shka> this song is literally the only reason i know that gaelic exists
[16:01:04] <selwyn> it looks like a dogfish or sth not a baby in a cradle

[16:03:19] <epony> 13m
[16:04:14] <pl> and consider that they are going at it for next 6 months
[16:04:18] <selwyn> is this the mission they were planning forever
[16:04:41] <pl> there are people who started their job with JWST and are getting close to retirement now, probably
[16:05:03] <epony> 8.08km/s
[16:05:40] <shka> yeah, it is a mission of a century 
[16:05:43] <shka> so far
[16:05:55] <epony> it's delayed a bit ;-)
[16:06:06] <epony> a couple of years
[16:06:18] <pl> if something goes wrong, the effect among engineers will be probably worse than if Polyot didn't launch
[16:06:41] <selwyn> i can't imagine
[16:06:42] <epony> roughly starting 2022 (the mission)
[16:07:08] <pl> and when Gorbachev personally came to Baikonur to talk about canceling Polyus test flight (sorry, sp), he was told there will be suicides if he orders it
[16:07:38] <shka> Russia <3
[16:07:45] <pl> Polyus flight ended up failing, but still delivered 80% of mission goals, iirc
[16:07:52] <selwyn> on the day we were going to publish, i found out that we might have been beaten to the discovery
[16:07:52] <epony> We sent 2 cosmonauts..

[16:08:52] <shka> ok, i don't speak french, but that didn't sound as either "normal" or "nominal"
[16:08:57] <shka> ok, that's better

[16:09:56] <shka> selwyn: really big laser, essentially
[16:10:05] <pl> selwyn: one of the errors of soviet union was that they took US boasting as true, so they outdid SDI
[16:10:18] <shka> dunno if they could use anything but the energia to even launch it
[16:10:24] <selwyn> and no investment in microelectronics
[16:10:38] <epony> it was the same as is now, embargoes and isolationism and sanctions by the wesern powers together
[16:10:51] <pl> selwyn: lots of investment, just remember that USSR was essentially always in emergency rebuilding state
[16:11:00] <pl> and Brezhnev kinda borked some of it
[16:11:34] <pl> and on top of that, they had Truman's and his ilk instituted policy that they considered to be danger
[16:11:35] <epony> he was end of career just peforming without responsibility
[16:11:59] <shka> selwyn: remember that microelectronics back in the 70s were this new crazy thing
[16:12:50] <epony> personal computers are the real achievement of the electronics industry
[16:13:12] <epony> and reliable modular communications
[16:14:40] <epony> that helped design larger and more complex machines and engineering projects
[16:15:01] <epony> and newer computing processors and other chips
[16:15:37] <epony> first the chips were drawn on larger computers and printed with optical lithography and magnification (miniaturisation)
[16:16:08] <epony> exactly as you print with chemical masks on PCBs etc
[16:16:32] <epony> that process was very advanced in mid-70ies already

[16:59:40] <treflip> merry christmas!
[17:00:13] <gilberth> Is our Christmas present, the James Webb telescope, launched yet?
[17:00:23] <shka> yes
[17:00:32] <shka> it is on it's way
[17:00:46] <shka> everything seemed to work fine
[17:00:57] <gilberth> Hey! That's great. Good news at our difficult times.
[17:01:11] <epony> kourou-kourou french-guiuiuiana
[17:01:43] <epony> best news of the decade in space observation
[17:11:56] <selwyn> has cet become the european time zone?
[17:12:50] <selwyn> i guess there is only one answer - had no idea so many countries use it
[17:13:22] <gilberth> Become? It has almost always been.
[17:14:38] <gilberth> This is not a Brexit thing that your clocks run funny. :-)
[17:14:59] <selwyn> i only noticed recently that times are sometimes given in cet by default
[17:15:41] <gilberth> Default? Not specifying the time zone?
[17:16:52] <selwyn> well, they did specify it actually
[17:18:46] <selwyn> unsure how to feel about jwst being named after a bureaucrat
[17:22:29] <selwyn> $10bn damn
[17:23:35] <shka> selwyn: yes, because project had delays
[17:23:42] <shka> a lot of delays
[17:28:07] * selwyn wants quantum clocks in space
[17:29:09] * gilberth wants that everyone just uses UTC. All year, no DST.
[17:29:29] <selwyn> bad idea sorry
[17:29:50] <gilberth> What's bad about UTC?
[17:30:00] <selwyn> utc isn't bad
[17:30:07] <selwyn> what's bad is everyone using it for everything
[17:30:44] <gilberth> Why is that?
[17:30:49] <selwyn> well
[17:31:54] <selwyn> you give up nearly completely the notion of times (like 12pm) correlating with important natural phenomena (like the maximal height of the sun in the sky)
[17:32:05] <selwyn> which we have, albeit imperfectly, with time zones
[17:32:32] <selwyn> and in exchange for what? no programmer has to deal with java.date.TimeZone or something? what's the advantage
[17:35:07] <selwyn> although time zones are crazy we have to respect the fact that they emerged over 100+ years as the solution to a difficult problem
[17:35:45] <lisp123> selwyn: But you can easily convert UTC to local time no?
[17:35:46] <selwyn> as such, from an engineering point of view they must be regarded with respect considering their longevity
[17:36:14] <selwyn> lisp123: indeed but iiuc gilberth is talking about scrapping local time
[17:36:25] <gilberth> selwyn: With 1h20 off here at DST, we already gave that up. It's way worse in Spain at almost about 2h30.
[17:36:51] <shka> selwyn: well, this allows people in the Union to work easier together 
[17:37:09] <lisp123> selwyn: Oh :) Then carry on, +1 support
[17:37:10] <gilberth> So in Spain with DST noon is at around 14:30. Nobody seems to care.
[17:37:12] <shka> for instance, there is little problem when you have to work for Spanish company from Poland
[17:37:33] <shka> there is a quite a bit of problem if you have to work for Texan company from Poland
[17:38:12] <shka> i used to have meetings scheduled for like 21:00
[17:38:27] * gilberth 's personal TZ is somewhere near Greenland. Perhaps even more west.
[17:39:10] <gilberth> shka: 21:00 is the time of day I am most alert, no matter how I slept. So that would be perfect for me. :-p

[18:02:01] <selwyn> i think they are serious, but not organised
[18:02:05] <shka> and i tried 
[18:02:06] <shka> HARD
[18:02:14] <selwyn> i don't know if they use fuzzy logic
[18:02:25] <shka> by fuzzy i mean machine learning
[18:02:31] <selwyn> they don't use that
[18:02:35] <selwyn> last time i checked
[18:02:41] <shka> ok, that makes some sense 
[18:02:45] <selwyn> i do know some ways you can bridge the two
[18:02:56] <selwyn> but i have mixed feelings about that
[18:03:03] <shka> i know about bayesian networks 
[18:03:18] <shka> which is perhaps the closest option
[18:03:36] * selwyn tries to remember
[18:04:31] <shka> bayesian networks run on the bayes theorem to obtain not only prediction but also uncertainty 
[18:04:44] <selwyn> there is a way to effectively backpropagate through symbolic logic though i forget the details
[18:04:53] <selwyn> allowing you to train a neural network
[18:05:14] <lisp123> selwyn: oh wow, its been that long since they advertised
[18:05:15] <shka> so it was the most suitable for risk management where uncertainty is critical  
[18:06:08] <shka> selwyn: yeah, that feels possible, but what i always wanted to achieve is ML producing symbols

[19:35:44] <selwyn> lain looks like Iain which is very funny
[19:36:16] <selwyn> how did i only just find out that lisp has an anime
[19:36:42] <shka> oh, you hanged long enough that we finally consider you one of us? :P
[19:37:27] <selwyn> i managed to assimilate while writing very little lisp
[19:37:34] <selwyn> so i did it efficiently i guess :D
[19:37:55] <shka> how unfortunate for you though
[19:39:45] <selwyn> yeah
[19:39:50] <selwyn> still no time for trial-vr

[20:32:01] <selwyn> it sounded like dr crusher's accent slipped to be english
[20:32:06] <selwyn> but the actress is american

[20:44:52] <selwyn>  it's sad how outdated the moral tone of the series seems
[20:49:27] <selwyn> didn't realise humans and romulans could mix
[20:49:48] <selwyn> tfw no romulan gf
[20:56:01] <shka> vulcan and humans can, so why not romulan?
[20:56:41] <selwyn> right
[20:56:58] <shka> also, you are referring to the drumhead i presume
[20:57:07] <selwyn> yeah
[20:57:18] <shka> it is tale from a different era
[20:57:49] <shka> it used to be accepted that you can't prosecute people without a solid reason

[20:58:20] <selwyn> return to pre 9 11
[20:59:06] <shka> yeah, imagine explaining that in the 2020 wide scale invigilation in the USA is just a thing that is done despite it is illegal
[20:59:26] <shka> and that Snowden, who brought it to the light is considered a traitor
[20:59:44] <selwyn> makes you think how pivotal the 2000s were
[20:59:47] <shka> that's some dystopian shit 
[21:00:19] <selwyn> civil liberties cheerfully thrown away
[21:00:59] <shka> well, imho cyberpunk writers were pretty spot on with predictions of the future
[21:01:31] <shka> how big tech companies will become the most influential institutions in the world
[21:01:33] <contrapunctus> On the subject of depressing things, I just remembered there was someone here who might relate with the latest poem I wrote.

[21:03:33] <shka> selwyn: and how hopeless reality seem to become, without a real prospect of social or political change
[21:04:40] <selwyn> idk i think it could go either way
[21:05:40] <selwyn> recently the japanese prime minister - of all people - made a speech critical of neoliberalism
[21:06:07] <selwyn> when the conservative prime minister of the third largest economy does that its a sign of something
[21:06:15] <shka> well, i mean, neoliberalism didn't work all that well in the Japan
[21:06:19] <selwyn> but its harder and harder to imagine any big change though, which is the important thing
[21:09:57] <selwyn> shka: even to recognise that neoliberalism bad is something

[23:10:15] <selwyn> star trek lore about why humanoid species look similar is really neat
[23:12:09] <shka> selwyn: the most interesting species are non-humanoid though
[23:13:02] <selwyn> true
[23:13:16] <selwyn> is that what makes ds9 good? the greater number of species?
[23:14:11] <shka> no, what makes DS9 interesting at least is being anti-TNG
[23:14:12] <selwyn> cause the only ones i have seen so far are vulkan, american and french
[23:14:44] <GreaseMonkey> WRT normal, are you sure that being stupid is normal, or is that just what a bunch of psychopaths paint as normal in order to fool people into being obedient to them?
[23:15:54] <shka> selwyn: DS9 has been envisioned as being distant to TNG, yet it had largely the same writers 
[23:16:23] <shka> and the results are stories which are both familiar and completely different from TNG
[23:16:31] <selwyn> interesting
[23:16:51] <shka> and in my opinion at least, DS9 is more even show then TNG
[23:17:01] <shka> even bad DS9 episodes are mostly watchable 
[23:17:28] <selwyn> i don't think its fair to assume that the 'normal' are stupid
[23:17:42] <selwyn> not too long ago they would tune in on a weeknight to watch tng
[23:17:50] <selwyn> which we clearly enjoy
[23:18:04] <shka> the best example of why DS9 is anti-tng

[23:20:59] <shka> it is kinda meta i would say
[23:21:02] <shka> ;-)
[23:21:25] <shka> and that was the last time Q was on the DS9
[23:22:56] <shka> oh, also DS9 was doing long arching stories

[23:28:05] <shka> age rating, that is
[23:28:38] <selwyn> what
[23:28:48] <selwyn> more violence?
[23:29:25] <shka> not drastically more but this would not fly on TNG https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWmcd4N0snY

[23:33:05] <shka> and is actually allowed to be a badass
[23:33:25] <selwyn> i don't feel like i've watched enough tng to start watching ds9 yet
[23:33:39] <selwyn> thats the main reason i don't watch ds9
[23:34:30] <shka> there is very little intersection between both 
[23:34:48] <shka> not a single borg pops up in the DS9 for instance 
[23:34:56] <selwyn> doesn't the character development in tng play a role
[23:35:02] <shka> not really
[23:35:26] <shka> characters in TNG don't change that much
[23:36:27] <shka> well, after the first two seasons at least
[23:36:57] <shka> it is still very much like TOS
[23:38:55] *** Quits: Inline (~Inline@aftr-37-201-240-204.unity-media.net) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:39:00] <shka> so you can watch episodes at random order and it is fine

[23:43:47] <shka> that was pretty easy 
[23:43:55] <selwyn> ez
[23:43:58] <shka> but i had to change interfaces
[23:44:27] <shka> luckly, now it is possible to implement all kinds of pruning algorithms
[23:46:36] <shka> i find writing documentation for lisp more difficult then writing lisp
