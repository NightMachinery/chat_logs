[20:56:09] <[Coke]> NYI makes it sound like it's on the roadmap. I think it's just not implemented.
[21:03:29] <moon-child> my primary association with 'NYI', at least in fairly mature projects, is 'this is gonna be a pain to implement and people don't really need it that badly, soo ... we're probably gonna get to it.  Eventually'
[21:04:13] <[Coke]> it's just literally not yet implemented, which implies the intent *is* to do it.
[21:04:22] <[Coke]> but yes, that's a reason why it's often "not yet"
[21:13:07] <[Coke]> Sorry, not trying to coke-splain. Just wanted to underscore that I don't think anyone is planning to make it work. :)
[21:19:36] * japhb imagines a Pepsi rolling its eyes at Coke-splaining -- "Yes, we all know what cola is, thank you.  Yes, we all know about your original formula ...."
[21:25:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Nemokosch#9980> Pepsi just doesn't taste like something you'd want to give real money for 😄
