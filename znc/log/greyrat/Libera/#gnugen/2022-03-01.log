[03:00:56] <sunyibo> At the risk of being off-topic: Volodymyr Zelensky starred in a tv series where he portrayed a history teacher caught on video ranting against a corrupt government. In the show he then becomes president. In real life the actor subsequently became president of Ukraine. Now he's sitting somewhere in Kiev being assaulted by the Russians. I nominate him badass of the century.
[03:01:34] <sunyibo> the show is on youtube.
