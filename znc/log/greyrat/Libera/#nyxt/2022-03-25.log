[03:20:38] <fnstudio> hi, i seem to be having some sort of geometry problem with my nyxt, as the status and the message areas are sort of collapsed together at the bottom of my window and only partially visible
[03:21:39] <fnstudio> i think i'm using a vanilla nyxt as ~/.config/nyxt/ only contains an apparently harmless auto-config.lisp
[03:25:56] <waleee> jmercouris: I present to you Germany's contribution in the weird-out Italians competition, https://image.stern.de/31636590/t/7y/v1/w1440/r1/-/fischstaebchen-pizza-bild-1.jpg
[03:26:29] <waleee> fnstudio: are you by chance using a hidpi monitor?
[03:26:59] <fnstudio> waleee: yeah, i think so...
[03:27:04] <fnstudio> good point...
[03:27:07] <waleee> or maybe eg. dwm, bspwm or similar as a window manager?
[03:27:21] <fnstudio> yeah that also applies...
[03:27:50] <fnstudio> oh my gosh, the perfect storm :) am i at the intersection of unlucky use cases?
[03:27:56] <waleee> fnstudio: ah, you will have to do some mnaual tinkering with the status bar & message area heights
[03:28:50] <waleee> fnstudio: the most likely cause is the hidpi-screen together with the default heights in nyxt
[03:28:56] <fnstudio> waleee: ok, no prob, i'll look for the name of the geometry configs then - unless you happen to know them from the top of your head?
[03:29:51] <fnstudio> ah wait, i can actually see a "Font size on HiDPI displays" section in the docs
[03:30:56] <fnstudio> ah! that did it!
[03:31:01] <fnstudio> thanks walee!
[03:31:22] <fnstudio> * waleee
[03:32:05] <waleee> nice. I was trying to remember which one of the example configs that had a relevant example of adjusting the status height
[03:32:55] <fnstudio> fixing the dpi setting as suggested under that section in the docs did it
[03:46:41] <fnstudio> not particularly important but i'm wondering if it's possible to fix the hidpi issue via a nyxt configuration (in a lisp file) rather than via the env variables - probably not otherwise the docs would have mentioned it...
[03:48:50] <waleee> you can via a (built-in) package called uiop
[03:49:09] <waleee> https://github.com/aartaka/nyxt-config/blob/master/init.lisp#L3
[03:49:47] <fnstudio> waleee: oh interesting, super, thanks again!
[03:49:49] <waleee> well, still ultimately via env variables
[03:50:09] <fnstudio> what does built-in mean in this context?
[03:50:55] <fnstudio> ah got it
[03:51:02] <waleee> you usually don't need to install it in nyxt, or with the most common compiler of commonlisp (sbcl)
[03:51:33] <waleee> * if you have nyxt, you can access uiop
[03:51:35] <fnstudio> sorry, i saw the github handle and thought it was a third party thing (instead of built-in) but that's only a reference
[03:51:43] <fnstudio> got it, thanks
[03:54:24] <waleee> fnstudio: don't be fooled by it being called uiop:getenv in aartaka's config, the setf before sets the variable
[04:05:11] *** Joins: perrierjouet (~perrier-j@modemcable012.251-130-66.mc.videotron.ca)
[04:08:47] <fnstudio> hm uiop:getenv doesn't seem to do it for me
[04:09:13] <fnstudio> i'm using something like (setf (uiop:getenv "GDK_SCALE") "2")
[04:09:29] <fnstudio> and similar for the DPI SCALE
[04:09:47] <waleee> could you try without the ".." around the numbers?
[04:11:01] <fnstudio> i thought of trying but then i saw an example at the very bottom here https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/documentation that has quotes around a number - but let me try
[04:11:30] <fnstudio> hm nope
[04:11:38] <fnstudio> the conf file is read
[04:11:55] <fnstudio> according to the <INFO> log in console
[04:11:55] *** Quits: ano (~ano@user/ano) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[04:11:58] <waleee> hm. You might have to declare the variables first in the environment
[04:12:22] *** Joins: ano (~ano@user/ano)
[04:12:31] <fnstudio> interesting
[04:12:38] <fnstudio> let me see
[04:12:52] * fnstudio pretending i know common lisp
[04:14:28] <waleee> ah, it seems it did set the variable even if it wasn't present
[04:14:48] <waleee> the wording was lightly ambigous in the uiop docs
[04:15:13] <fnstudio> ok, so it's not that either...?
[04:16:55] <waleee> fnstudio: could you pastebin the init.lisp as it is right now?
[04:17:30] <fnstudio> sure, but it's actually the line pasted above plus this one (setf (uiop:getenv "GDK_DPI_SCALE") "0.5")
[04:18:15] <fnstudio> i hate polluting the room, but it's actually just that, so pastebin might have been an overkill in this case :)
[04:18:20] <waleee> hm. can you start nyxt from a terminal with nyxt -v ?
[04:18:34] <fnstudio> sure thing, hold on
[04:18:41] <waleee> fnstudio: ok, if it was only those 2 lines :)
[04:19:33] <fnstudio> should i look for anything in partic?
[04:19:41] <fnstudio> in the console output?
[04:20:41] <waleee> if there is any WARNING or ERROR in it
[04:21:30] <fnstudio> nah not really :(
[04:21:45] <fnstudio> only DEBUG and INFO
[04:22:07] <waleee> nothing with GDK_ ?
[04:23:04] <fnstudio> a DEBUG statement about "Initializing GI-GTK Interface"
[04:23:12] <waleee> that's normal
[04:23:15] <fnstudio> but no WARNINGS/ERRORS
[04:23:57] <waleee> I will check if setf:ing GDK_SCALE does anything on my (admittedly non-hidpi) setup
[04:24:34] <fnstudio> the fact that the docs report the dpi-fix by means of env variables... could that indicate that the uiop thing doesn't work in this case?
[04:25:12] <fnstudio> maybe because of the timing at which that config is read?
[04:25:56] <waleee> gtk/gdk can be a bit iffy with respecting settings in environment variables, but I'm not sure if this is one it ignores if the gtk process has started
[04:27:01] <waleee> s/not sure/don't know/
[04:27:45] <waleee> seems like it is ignored, tried it with a value of 100
[04:28:04] <waleee> * ignored at the stage the config is read
[04:28:45] <fnstudio> yeah, so it's either via shell or nothing
[04:29:23] <waleee> I'd go with wrapping nyxt in a short shell script that sets them
[04:29:28] <fnstudio> i'm fine with that, at least it was an excuse to start familiarising with the config a bit
[04:29:37] <fnstudio> thank you vvv much waleee
[04:30:09] <waleee> no problem. Have fun with the tinkering :)
[04:30:30] <fnstudio> oh, and there's a good news, it seems i was able to install all dependencies needed for playing videos - so i'm happy and one step further
