[00:00:38] <s7r> after a full dist-upgrade from stretch to buster, the OS hard drive (a SSD in /dev/sda) has lost all its partitions and I get a "no boot device" error. anyone experienced this?
[00:01:02] <sney> not directly as a result of the dist-upgrade
[00:01:26] <sney> are you sure you're looking at the right disk? a change in udev could have shuffled your /dev/sdX names around

[00:02:17] <s7r> sney, I am 100% yes. I have 3 storage devices. one was the OS install and sdb and sdc are linux raid members (raid1)
[00:02:39] <s7r> they appear to be unaffected. partition manager sees them as linux raid members. however on sda it sees only "unallocated space"
[00:02:45] <sney> ok. boot from a live environment, and use testdisk on the ssd to recover the partition table
[00:03:05] <s7r> sney, which live environment? any particular one i should use?
[00:03:18] <sney> grml is nice, but the only requirement is a linux kernel and the testdisk tool

[02:53:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Khepra: Precisely. It's the hyperspec package in stable. If you download its source using "apt source", you'll find that the postinst script in /debian just wgets it from ftp before extracting the tar file into its end-destination.
[02:53:44] <sney> Khepra: it's hyperspec, a downloader in contrib that downloads the actual software separately
[02:53:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The package itself is, in fact, empty.
[02:54:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> This is due to licensing reasons.
[02:54:04] <Khepra> oh
[02:54:10] <Khepra> definitely huge bug
[02:54:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The lack of verification however isn't required by license at all.

[02:55:16] <sney> and bugs tagged patch tend to get processed faster :)

[02:55:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sucker's bet, indeed.
[02:55:52] <sney> it certainly would if it was in main. but contrib downloaders are sort of a best-effort thing aiui
[02:55:59] <Khepra> by "this" I mean that the package as downloader is not verifying what it downloads
[02:56:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, I'd understood.
[02:56:14] <Khepra> it's a problem solved decade(s) ago
[02:59:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It's probably never been fixed because no one looked at it and it hasn't broken. It's pretty much there so that Emacs' SLIME hyperspec lookup feature can work fully locally.

[08:09:04] <somiaj> the bot just auto detects this, but we can increase the time frame a bit
[08:09:23] <somiaj> they just need to fix_their_connection
[08:10:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm somewhat sympathetic to the issues as bad ISPs often can't be fixed and renting a VPS to host a bnc is some commitment. But surely shell accounts are still a thing?
[08:11:04] <somiaj> Anyways, I think there is a way to ignore joins/parts smartly on your client so you still see relevant joins/parts but not the connection problem ones
[08:11:26] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Depends on client, but I can attest that weechat & irssi both do.

[08:59:35] <somiaj> You are suppose to keep it updated, though sometimes regressions do happen
[08:59:56] <somiaj> It could also be some other issue, so when a problem arises, one needs to do some debugging.
[09:00:18] <somiaj> Anyways, you say your machine can't goto sleep. What does 'sudo systemctl suspend' do if you run it from a terminal?
[09:03:56] <JackFrost> Billy: Oddly, I have a system that suspends and awakens fine, but as soon as I suspend and close the lid, it's off.  As long as I leave the lid open, everything is fine.
[09:04:35] <somiaj> JackFrost: Sounds like your lid toggle button is having trouble, if you just close the lid does it suspend?
[09:04:41] <JackFrost> Obviously I set it to just turn the screen off when the lid is closed, so it doesn't suspend. :P

[09:05:28] <somiaj> Yea, being able to close the lid while using an external monintor can be useful too

[14:02:54] <Khepra> dokma: might be also wise to run a tcpdump -w in another terminal or shell (with appropriate filters) so you can analyze the cirucmstances when the connection apparently freezes, with something like wireshark. for example, is there a RST? do packets continue going into void from the client side, but no ack's or responses from the server side? or packets from the client completely stop?
[14:05:40] <hejux> Khepra: you are right. that string1 > string2 only works when the major version is a single number.
[14:05:54] <Khepra> hejux: ede:   here's the ultimate, no edge cases, no buggy version parsing, based-on-actual-package-version-as-known-to-dpkg solution:    https://stackoverflow.com/a/18408532
[14:06:02] <hejux> if the major version is like 10 ... then the test fail
[14:06:30] <Khepra> this asks dpkg-query for package version and asks dpkg to compare versions which includes EPOCHS and every other version component known to dpkg. as robust as possible, even if a bit verbose.
[14:06:52] <hejux> Khepra:well that works only on debian
[14:06:58] <Khepra> we're in #debian :)
[14:07:25] <Khepra> Shirley, you did not waste our time by asking something about other distros :)

[17:44:32] <Khepra> https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/apache-log4j2
[17:44:35] <dvs> Ah, they found something else
[17:44:46] <Khepra> there are at least 3 (three) issues by my counting
[17:44:50] <knghtbrd> CVE-2021-45046 was fixed in 2.16
[17:44:53] <jonmaxtitor> I don't play minecraft then I don't be affected.
[17:45:14] <dvs> I was reading about 44228
[17:45:19] <knghtbrd> CVE-2021-45105 indicated the fix wasn't fixed enough
[17:45:55] <jonmaxtitor> Do Minetest use apache-log4j?

[20:56:48] <somiaj> ahh okay, just seeing why you would want packages vs a virtual enviorment with pip
[20:57:07] <somiaj> anyways, that does look dated. I don't know dh_python well enough, but I would at a minimum remove all the python2 stuff from those debian/rules examples
[20:58:00] <wyre> somiaj, I'd like to produce .deb packages, just that, and apparently I think I can take advantage of my already made setup.py

[20:58:20] <somiaj> yea, and dh_python should help with this, I just don't know the details. I just think the page you linked is dated
[21:00:00] <somiaj> maybe start with man dh_python
[21:00:16] <wyre> somiaj, my problem right now is that I know a general idea about what files/scripts I need to create a .deb package
[21:01:26] <wyre> and where should this dh_python be used ... 🤔
[21:01:46] <somiaj> It is used automatically with debian helper I belive once you have the correct info in debian/rules
[21:02:41] <wyre> somiaj, debian/rules?
[21:02:50] <wyre> and what debian helper? 🤔
[21:02:59] <somiaj> Sounds like maybe you should start with the maintainers guide
[21:03:03] <somiaj> !nmg
[21:03:03] <dpkg> The packaging tutorial (https://deb.li/QYyI) and the New Maintainer's Guide (https://deb.li/3DiDA) are good places to start learning about Debian packaging.  You should also ask me about <devref> and <policy> to understand how packages should be maintained and how they should interact with each other.  Ask me about <package basics>, <mentors>, <best practices> <build without helper>.  https://www.debian.org/devel/
[21:03:06] *** Joins: chipox (~chipox@86.106.74.74)
[21:03:58] <somiaj> this explains the basics of building a debian package, which requires a debian/ inside the source and various files inside that directory. Those files are what is used to build the .deb. debian/rules is the main build script, but you also need debian/control and a few other files. Also maybe look at some example python package
[21:04:00] <wyre> somiaj, sure, but I think there are more info than I need
[21:04:16] <wyre> I think the core section is the section 4, right?
[21:04:29] <wyre> required files under the debian directory, right?

[21:24:07] <maxzor_> does it not make sense for a random user to get the whole mesa by default with a big meta package?
[21:24:55] <somiaj> wyre: maybe #packaging on irc.oftc.net will help guide you through the process, but that example package I linked is fairly straight forward what you need in debian/ -- though some understanding of the basics of package creation is needed
[21:25:43] <maxzor_> like libegl-mesa0, libgl1-mesa-dri, libglapi-mesa, libglu1-mesa, libglx-mesa0, mesa-utils, mesa-va-drivers, mesa-vdpau-drivers, mesa-vulkan-drivers,
