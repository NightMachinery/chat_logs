[00:44:12] <Maybelline[m]> Hi.  I'm pretty new to neovim, but am looking to dress it up to meet my needs. I looked at Lunarvim, but I really want to understand what I'm doing when I configure things... anyone have a nice HOWTO on how they set up their environment?  Really, looking for a Treeview, some LSP-stuff and am eager to hear other folks' favorite plugins, etc.  Appreciate any info!

[00:45:17] <mjlbach[m]> nothing fancy
[00:45:42] <mjlbach[m]> I like gitsigns, nvim-lint, vim-surround, and vim-fugitive

[02:32:18] <gpanders> But both Neovim and Vim already have the concept of "compiler" plugins which are able to interpret the output of external commands and put them in the quickfix list, and `vim.diagnostic` contains `vim.diagnostic.match` for converting error strings into diagnostic objects. So there already is some support

[02:41:12] <colordrops> I don't understand how things work behind the scenes. I got an error that the languageserver couldn't be found, even though it was on the path, and it was only fixed by replacing the tilde with the absolute path in my PATH.
[02:41:33] <colordrops> I could run the server from the bash command line fine.
[02:42:15] <colordrops> I assume uv_spawn is a lower level than nvim?
[02:42:21] <colordrops> from a quick google search
[02:42:28] <mjlbach[m]> it's luv (lua bindings to libuv)
[02:43:13] <mjlbach[m]> there is no way I can get an explicit tilde in my path, it always expands for me

[02:46:56] <colordrops> It's the way the DM loads the shell I believe
[02:47:06] <gpanders> colordrops: you can always use `vim.env.HOME` or `os.getenv('HOME')` instead of `~` just to be safe
[02:47:14] <colordrops> for instance there's a script called `wayland_session` that launches the shell for SDDM
[02:47:30] <mjlbach[m]> gpanders: I don't think they are setting anything path environmental variables in neovim
[02:47:50] <mjlbach[m]> they are saying having a tilde in their system PATH is breaking uv_spawn
[02:47:50] <colordrops> yeah I've replaced the tildes and got it working.  I'm only bringing it up here in case it's a problem with nvim or something others have run into.
[02:48:42] <colordrops> You may be able to reproduce it by just updating your path on the command line and running vim, e.g. PATH="~/<path-to-bins>:abc:def" nvim

[02:53:07] <gpanders> in my experience tilde expansion into $HOME is pretty inconsistent, some programs do it and some don't. It's usually better to be explicit if there's any ambiguity

[12:05:58] <clason[m]> muniftanjim: that is definitely welcomed, but it's part of a wider discussion around the API (I know your PR). Unfortunately, most of the core team is focused on other components right now, so everything tree-sitter is moving relatively slowly. Don't be afraid to ping people on your PR, though (which I just did).

[16:56:10] <JulianJulianBerm> Can I not spell "give me all extmarks regardless of namespace"?
[16:57:00] <JulianJulianBerm> Even using `nvim_get_namespaces` doesn't seem like it will work for that, as it will ignore anonymous namespaces
[17:04:15] <DavideP[m]> Is there a way to search for a word in a whole project? I mean, I have a CPP project that of course includes files from different packages. Is there a way to search in all project files and included files too? Is this something that the lsp has to take care of?
[17:04:55] <zeraphel> DavideP[m]: `vimgrep /word/ **`
[17:05:05] <zeraphel> s/word/pattern
[17:05:33] <DavideP[m]> But that searches by path
[17:05:42] <DavideP[m]> Am I right?
[17:06:02] <zeraphel> it globs from cwd
[17:06:40] <zeraphel> think telescope has a live-grep feature built in
[17:06:45] <DavideP[m]> I would need to search also in the CPP included files
[17:06:58] <DavideP[m]> I use it
[17:07:05] <DavideP[m]> But it is path based
[17:07:19] <zeraphel> ah i see what you mean
[17:07:41] <DavideP[m]> Yes
[17:08:19] <DavideP[m]> It's for debugging purposes basically, I need to search where the log message I get is written, and unfortunately it isn't in the main package
[17:08:21] *** Quits: kron (~weechat@user/qaph) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:09:00] <DavideP[m]> So it must be in some of the included files, which aren't included in ripgrep searches 
[17:09:14] *** Joins: kron (~weechat@user/qaph)
[17:09:43] <clason[m]> But you can easily tell telescope to search from other directories
[17:10:08] <DavideP[m]> Yes, but it should be automatic
[17:10:13] <clason[m]> No it should not
[17:10:21] <DavideP[m]> No I mean
[17:10:22] <clason[m]> oh, you mean for you?

[17:10:32] *** Joins: ixil (~ixil@mpp-cp1-natpool-1-241.ethz.ch)
[17:10:55] <DavideP[m]> Once I want to search all the files included it shouldn't require a manual insertion of the path
[17:10:56] <clason[m]> You need to have a way of detecting the root of your project (like lspconfig uses)
[17:11:08] *** Joins: zro (~zro@user/zro)

[17:12:38] <clason[m]> even LSP does not have grep functions
[17:13:12] <DavideP[m]> I wouldn't mind of other components are needed 
[17:13:53] <clason[m]> you might be able to get somewhere with sourcegraph (which TJ might have some Neovim integration, but the integration is not trivial)
[17:13:53] <DavideP[m]> Did you understand my issue?
[17:14:21] <clason[m]> you want to grep in a set of files that are distributed across multiple root directories

[19:01:41] <AndreasGerlach[m> more recently I also noticed that I had to change the statement from
[19:01:41] <AndreasGerlach[m> `local hl = "LspDiagnosticsSign" .. type`

[19:01:41] <AndreasGerlach[m> `local hl = "DiagnosticSign" .. type`

[20:02:27] <kylo252[m]> How about doing it the same as the others, when firing a format request, we store some metric of the current buffer's content. When the reply arrives, you do the same calculation again, and if the results are different then we issue a warning that the request got aborted. 
[20:02:27] <kylo252[m]> It's kinda similar to method #2 I guess

[21:35:54] <minutestoseconds> Need some help with error
[21:40:38] <jamessan[m]> Maybe related to https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090#issuecomment-1004318147?
[21:42:51] <minutestoseconds> Im on beta PPA
[21:43:30] <SeanDewar[m]> are you passing nil as the buffer handle to nvim_buf_set_option?
[21:43:59] <SeanDewar[m]> or some other non-number thing
[21:44:01] <minutestoseconds> SeanDewar[m]: Ill send that init.vim

[21:44:54] <SeanDewar[m]> looks like bufnr is nil so yeah
[21:45:17] <SeanDewar[m]> pass 0 instead if you want to use the current buffer
[21:45:23] <SeanDewar[m]> which would've been the previous behaviour
[21:46:02] <minutestoseconds> SeanDewar[m]: It was working fine earlier.
[21:46:02] <minutestoseconds> Broke after update
[21:46:08] <SeanDewar[m]> yes
[21:46:09] *** Joins: xsteadfa1 (~marv@94.31.106.190)
[21:46:09] <SeanDewar[m]> thats intended
[21:47:31] <minutestoseconds> SeanDewar[m]: I don't understand lua
[21:47:31] <minutestoseconds> Can you please help me add it?
[21:47:31] <minutestoseconds> What do need to change
[21:47:50] <mjlbach[m]> bufnr is nil
[21:47:52] <gpanders> line 17, `s/bufnr/0/`
[21:48:14] <mjlbach[m]> also that's not how that function should be used
[21:48:30] <jamessan[m]> That function is copy/pasted from the example lspconfig setup, which is calling `buf_set_option` from `on_attach` and therefore has bufnr in scope
[21:48:36] <mjlbach[m]> buf_set_option will only set it on initialization for buffer 0
[21:48:42] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah what jamessan is saying :) 
[21:49:33] <minutestoseconds> jamessan[m]: My bad 
[21:49:33] <minutestoseconds> I have no idea what you are saying
[21:50:46] <minutestoseconds> Yeah i copied it from someone
[21:50:46] <minutestoseconds> Just to have auto completeion for c++
[21:53:07] <jamessan[m]> Don't copy unless you understand what it's doing. Just delete `buf_set_option`, since you're not using it in the on_attach
[21:53:42] <jamessan[m]> Or show where you're actually using it, if you want to fix that
[21:55:18] <mjlbach[m]> > <@minutestoseconds:matrix.org> Yeah i copied it from someone
[21:55:18] <mjlbach[m]> > Just to have auto completeion for c++
[21:55:18] <mjlbach[m]> why not copy from the lspconfig wiki instead :) 
[21:59:14] <minutestoseconds> <gpanders> "line 17, `s/bufnr/0/`" <- Works!
[21:59:22] <minutestoseconds> No error now when i open nvim

[22:17:19] <pun> Hi. I'm trying to replicate this person's nvim configuration because I like how it's organized, but for some reason I'm having trouble loading configurations and I think it's because I've basically been learning lua while configuring nvim. https://github.com/PlatyPew/neovim-init.lua/blob/69bd58cf65c0a02fbdc64cb1fecbd0345920b98c/lua/plugins.lua#L70 . Here is my current nvim configuration folder
[22:17:22] <pun> structure: https://0x0.st/oinP.png and here is my plugins.lua which gets required by init.lua http://0x0.st/oinT.lua and here is config/lualine.lua https://0x0.st/oinm.lua

[22:22:31] <pun> it's basically the getConfig function that fails.

[22:28:39] <pun> Ok, I changed function GetConfig to local function getConfig and it works. I need to learn about scope and stuff in lua. Sorry if you wasted time on this. Thank you.
