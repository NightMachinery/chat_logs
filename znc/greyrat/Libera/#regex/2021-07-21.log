[01:00:48] <Simon80> I have these gigantic strings that represent math equations. Sometimes they can contain extraneous operators. Like this...      1-+-+--3
[01:01:07] <Simon80> Is it possible to write an algorithm using only regex to simplify the extra +/-?
[01:01:14] <Simon80> Any -- becomes a +
[01:01:19] <Simon80> Any ++ becomes a +
[01:01:20] *** briand is now known as subie
[01:01:31] <Simon80> Any +- becomes -
[01:02:31] <Simon80> So in that example, it should become         1+3
[01:04:52] *** Quits: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:22:50] <JohnDoe2> Simon80 yes you can match repeating character and replace them with something but there's no code, no keeping track of what was matched. So if you tell it +- should become - then that's what it will do
[01:23:47] <ZZzz> digitok: I've tested your suggestion (  https://regex101.com/r/oY9Du6/2 ) on English letters and it works, thank you!
[01:24:40] <Simon80> JohnDoe2 that would be perfect. I don't need to match anything here; only looking to filter.
[01:27:57] <JohnDoe2> Simon80 ok for --/++ => + https://regex101.com/r/fFnOd6/1 and for +- => - https://regex101.com/r/fFnOd6/2
[01:29:49] <Simon80> 1++++3   (first link)  matches ++ twice and replaces each one with + so the final product is           1++3       but we need it to be 1+3
[01:32:53] <JohnDoe2> so then we're not doing any ++ becomes a +
[01:35:34] <JohnDoe2> https://regex101.com/r/fFnOd6/3
[01:36:07] <JohnDoe2> if this is multiplication of +/- numbers that will give an incorrect answer as - x - = +
[01:36:43] <ZZzz> digitok: it works with Hebrew as well. Thank you!

[17:10:49] <fakuve> Hi guyss
[17:11:23] <fakuve> just a quickie for me please :D  . Lolz . Anyone able to simplify this regex to a simpler one? https://regex101.com/r/wLz7lf/1
[17:11:48] <fakuve> I mean `[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}-[A-Z0-9]{4}` can be simplified I reckon
[17:13:54] <digitok> i can simplify it to a more complicated one
[17:14:36] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/wLz7lf/2
[17:19:53] <purplex> interesting

[17:35:20] <digitok> just a quick one that i'll respond to after a long time
[17:39:18] <purplex> how can i tell which is simplified or complicated e.g. /1 or /2? from length of regex?
[17:39:40] <OnlineCop> I'm not seeing any letters beyond A-F. Are you sure it's not just hex values?
[17:41:15] <OnlineCop> `(?:[[:xdigit:]]{4}-){5}[[:xdigit:]]{4}`
[17:41:26] <digitok> gross
[17:41:50] <OnlineCop> `(?:[^\W_]{4}-){5}[^\W_]{4}`
[17:42:05] <digitok> gross
[17:42:49] <digitok> jk, it's not that bad
[17:42:54] <OnlineCop> `[A-Z0-9]{2}(?:[A-Z0-9]{2}-[A-Z0-9]{2}){5}[A-Z0-9]{2}`

[17:43:08] <digitok> ok, put the keyboard down
[17:44:03] <OnlineCop> This is what you get when you combine an IRC client with an AR headset...
[17:44:48] <fakuve> sry guys didnt see your response cos I was checking on #regexp 
[17:44:53] <fakuve> yep it could be hex
[17:45:05] <OnlineCop> There's a #regexp ?
[17:45:05] <fakuve> but I wanna make sure , is a CD key
[17:45:15] <digitok> you can use A-F instead of A-Z, probably doesn't matter
[17:45:23] <fakuve> there are two other people on there
[17:45:34] <fakuve> yep
[17:45:36] <digitok> note this regex doesn't ensure there aren't more letters before or after
[17:47:40] <fakuve> yep it should be like that
[17:48:09] <fakuve> 4 positions of either hex or digits , preceeded by a -
[17:48:14] <fakuve> that 6 times
[17:48:28] <fakuve> yep ok I get it
[17:48:32] <fakuve> Thankas!

[18:44:59] <re101-beetle-17> digitok Thanks man
[18:45:02] <JohnDoe2> DynV are you trying to replace "Cantrip" with 0 while the others maintain their matched digit?
[18:45:05] <DynV> oh, "|([^\t]*)" should not be done if there's a #, I think https://regex101.com/r/osqKUq/4/ is better
[18:45:07] <digitok> yw
[18:45:26] <DynV> yes, but there's also an error catcher
[18:45:36] <DynV> because no line should be skipped
[18:46:44] <DynV> also I tink V4 would take less processing than V3
[18:46:48] <JohnDoe2> DynV right so what you do in code is a separate thing, but regex itself cannot replace conditionally - aka if it's Cantrip then = 0, if it's a digit, keep digit. You would have to do multiple passes
[18:46:59] <rahul> digitok https://regex101.com/r/oizBxG/2 can we do it without group?

[18:48:28] <DynV> perhaps it was a fluke but I did a replace in the past and it worked, one something else I did ^((?:[^\t]*\t){7}[^\t]*ua(?:\s(\d+))?(?:[^\t]*\t){6})(.*)$ to \1(?2$2:?)\3 and it worked as expected
