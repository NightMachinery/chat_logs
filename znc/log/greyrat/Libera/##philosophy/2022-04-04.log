[00:00:30] <Delf> You do realize some are as violent as they are gentle and kind, yes?
[00:00:56] <juliaEnv> yes, that's given by training (incl. environmental training)
[00:01:14] <juliaEnv> during a war, the non-violent don't matter
[00:01:17] <Delf> Or consequence of internal development
[00:01:24] <juliaEnv> yes
[00:02:22] <gb73d> Someone I worked for said "Theres something about power you dont understand" thats true, when people get power it changes them.
[00:02:46] <gb73d> Dictactors want to stay in power forever.
[00:02:49] <juliaEnv> it appears a powerless person can turn into a powerful person in 1 or 2 months of training
[00:02:51] <Delf> Some people yes, some no. They're inner corruption is brought to the surface
[00:03:07] <gb73d> Its like a drug same as money.
[00:03:37] <juliaEnv> actually, one drug in particular makes people aggressive. The drug was heavily used in WW2. It's meth (advertised under a special brand Pervitin).
[00:03:59] <gb73d> Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, that saying
[00:03:59] <juliaEnv> https://time.com/5752114/nazi-military-drugs/
[00:04:00] <ro-bot-o> [url] How Methamphetamine Became Part of Nazi Military Strategy | Time | time.com
[00:04:01] <Delf> Drugs can be used to modify their internal feelings and emotions to certain things and then you can put them on exercises to train them to behave the same without drugs
[00:04:34] <gb73d> I mean power is addictive in that sense
[00:04:43] <juliaEnv> Mike Tyson used Meth to win boxing fights. He confessed a year or two ago.
[00:04:46] <gb73d> they want more and more

[00:06:03] <juliaEnv> it appears more and more to me that soldiers are ordinary people like you and me, only with a few quick cheats that took a month or two of training, and their power increased extremely much after that, and permanently
[00:06:08] <gb73d> some of it is the desire to be like god

[00:07:04] <juliaEnv> yes, I agree
[00:08:30] <juliaEnv> so it seems everything can be used as a weapon. Information as a weapon, law as a weapon, trust as a weapon, Internet as a weapon, laser as a weapon, energy as a weapon, prices as weapons, ...
[00:08:53] <juliaEnv> that includes Meth as a weapon (as used in WW2)
[00:09:01] <Delf> Yes, everything can be weaponized

[00:10:23] <gb73d> In engineering they say every advantage has a disadvantage and every disadvantage has an advantage - thats true
[00:10:34] <juliaEnv> this requires a training to know what can be used and how, and then if people get to use their weapons, after a while they will get as corrupt as our authorities, won't they?
[00:11:03] <Delf> Only as corrupt as they already were
[00:11:09] <gb73d> in stoicism they say whenever anything goes wrong start thinking of ways to turn it to you advantage - I try to do that
[00:11:36] <juliaEnv> great, I try to do that too
[00:12:01] <juliaEnv> it seems new personal powers result in a new level of personal corruption
[00:12:16] <Delf> You can dwell on the damage done to you (default behavior, cry for help) or you can adjust to the situation and deal damage back
[00:12:32] <gb73d> i find stoic philosophy is very helpful in these days or crisis
[00:12:38] <gb73d> of
[00:12:53] <juliaEnv> yes, the latter requires training to be combat ready and manipulation competent
[00:13:17] <gb73d> work hard now , keep practising . keep training
[00:13:36] <gb73d> its a very positive philosophy
[00:13:37] <juliaEnv> yes, that brings the idea of a good teacher required

[22:52:44] <Lumine> There's like 50 million of them in DA alone
[22:53:01] <arryana> still not enough
[22:54:08] <Lumine> There was someone who said that artists are useless. lol
[22:54:12] <arryana> the effort of creation is a gift to everyone
[22:54:14] <arryana> ha
[22:54:25] <arryana> yeah, well.  that just sounds like bitterness to me.
[22:57:25] <Lumine> I should fire up the paint brush

[23:32:56] <arryana> sure
[23:33:00] <arryana> i crochet too.
[23:33:32] <arryana> i find it rather odd that anyone would announce the conversation in here somewhere else, though
[23:38:40] <acdw> eyyy
[23:38:53] <acdw> i heard in #emacs yall were talking about knitting and puppies
[23:39:06] <acdw> also i do like philosophy, well, sort of
[23:39:39] <arryana> most things have a philosophical slant, from where i sit
[23:39:56] <arryana> i'm not actually knitting, it's tunisian crochet.  but i didn't think anyone here much cared about that distinction
[23:40:41] <acdw> oh very cool! i do!
[23:40:49] * arryana is making the morale fiber elf coat
[23:40:58] <acdw> those patterns are beautiful, but i've never tried it meself
[23:41:32] <arryana> this is my first go of anything that elaborate
[23:44:25] <arryana> what do you make?

[23:46:09] <acdw> i've not made anything in a while,,, but i made blankets. scarves, washclothes
[23:46:10] <acdw> hats
[23:46:29] * arryana nods
[23:46:43] * blkshp could use a new hat.
[23:46:58] <acdw> .
[23:47:17] <arryana> i can arrange that.
[23:48:03] <blkshp> :D
[23:48:26] <acdw> #randomactsofhat
[23:48:49] <arryana> once i finish the sleeves on this thing, i just have to put them and the hood on, then do the edging.
[23:49:02] <acdw> ooooh nice
[23:49:05] <arryana> after that, i've been asked to make a box of ants, which will be interesting
[23:49:16] <blkshp> IF I'm totally honest I hate hats! lol
[23:49:19] <arryana> hahaha
[23:49:21] <blkshp> I have a XXL head!
[23:49:35] <arryana> that's the marvel of homemade, it doesn't matter how big your head is
[23:49:38] <acdw> ants?!
[23:49:42] <arryana> ants.
[23:49:46] <blkshp> Well I was in 2017 when I had my head measured in Locke and Co of London :)
[23:49:53] <arryana> out of sewing thread and a very tiny hook
[23:49:58] <acdw> unless ur head is so big that all the yarn in the world won't work with it
[23:50:03] <acdw> arryana sounds fun tbh

[23:50:19] * blkshp cries at "ur"
[23:50:19] <parsnip> i'm like a 7 3/4" head maybe
[23:50:24] <arryana> it's a running joke,  a friend's fiancee sent us a box of donuts, and didn't tell us she was doing it.
[23:50:27] <parsnip> or hat size, w/e
[23:50:34] <arryana> so we found them on the doorstop several hours later, covered in ants.
[23:50:38] <parsnip> very tough time finding hats
[23:50:48] <arryana> we joke that she sent us the best box of ants we'd ever received.
[23:50:54] <parsnip> bucket hats, for example
[23:50:55] <arryana> so, i've been asked to make her a box of ants.
[23:52:13] <acdw> blkshp you don't like the oldest city in the world?!
[23:52:24] <acdw> parsnip: i think i have the same hat size
[23:52:45] <acdw> arryana : that sounds awesome ngl
[23:52:49] <blkshp> acdw: I'm English, I both know it as that and a steaming cess pool so, sort of
[23:53:15] <parsnip> i can fit a 7 5/8, but historically i preferred a little extra room
[23:53:18] <blkshp> But it's ok I live 195 miles away!
[23:53:20] <arryana> huh.  i'd have guessed greece or lebanon for older cities
[23:53:40] <acdw> steaming cess pool?
[23:53:47] * arryana looks to see how far she is from london
[23:53:48] <acdw> blkshp oh cool, 195 miles from ur?
[23:54:07] <blkshp> Sorry, don't know what that means.
[23:54:11] <blkshp> Invalid questio.
[23:54:15] <arryana> wow, 400 miles
[23:54:15] <blkshp> s/o./on.
[23:54:16] <ro-bot-o> blkshp meant to say: Invalid question.
[23:54:34] <arryana> i didn't think it was that far
[23:54:58] <acdw> blkshp what's a steaming cess pool?
[23:55:03] <blkshp> I'd say we're a half way house for you but it's probably 500 miles if you go through Shropshire
