[14:48:24] <jaawerth[m]> I notice there around any conditionals around the `.get_client_by_id` calls to see if it succeeded, but I don't know the lsp api super well so maybe there's a way to cancel existing progress/etc handlers

[15:11:58] <rumpelsepp> heya. Are there any plans to include something (simple) like [tcomment](https://github.com/tomtom/tcomment_vim) in the core? Commenting files is a very basic operation and it's too bad that a plugin is needed for a shortcut like `gcc` for toggling a line comment.
[15:12:44] <rumpelsepp> s/files/lines/
[15:15:35] <dundargoc[m]> No plans that I'm aware of. The general mindset tends to be "if a plugin does it and does it well, why should it be in core"? More code/functionality in core means more maintenance.

[15:25:06] <clason[m]> no, not necessarily
[15:25:23] <clason[m]> plugins are core to the *vim philosophy
[15:25:57] <jaawerth[m]> I would suspect the main reason against it would be that plugins like that inevitably end up with per-language comment formatting data that needs maintenance (in multiple styles) like all this https://github.com/tomtom/tcomment_vim/blob/master/autoload/tcomment/types/default.vim
[15:26:16] <ShougoShougo[m]> I don't think comment out should be built-in.
[15:26:17] <clason[m]> you cannot improve on https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary
[15:26:40] <clason[m]> you could think about bundling it, but I'm not sure tpope would agree
[15:27:09] <clason[m]> long-term, integrating this with tree-sitter could be an argument for a closer integration
[15:27:32] <jaawerth[m]> yeah that could work but probably wouldn't help for pretty-formatting in line with whatever the lang's conventions are
[15:27:46] <clason[m]> but as always, plugins offer
[15:27:46] <clason[m]> 1. faster development (not tied to Neovim releases)
[15:27:46] <clason[m]> 2. more choice
[15:27:46] <gaarco[m]> is there any reason a theme plugin should load highlights with `vim.loop.new_async`?
[15:27:55] <clason[m]> no
[15:28:00] <clason[m]> just... no
[15:28:05] <jaawerth[m]> though commentary may be the only one that afaik doesn't have stuff like what I linked earlier, I know nerdcommenter does. I assume the tpope one just tries to use syntax files
[15:28:25] <clason[m]> well, not the syntax file -- just the comment leader string
[15:28:50] <clason[m]> it's intentionally simple (in features; getting edge cases right still takes a lot of effort)
[15:28:51] <jaawerth[m]> right, makes sense
[15:29:15] <jaawerth[m]> it will successfully comment, just not necessarily in the style the user is going for, but hey, less of what I linked above
[15:29:18] <clason[m]> If you want something much more featureful and syntax-aware, try https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim
[15:29:45] <jaawerth[m]> ha! I knew there was no way there wouldn't already be a treesitter one
[15:29:52] <clason[m]> yeah, the only thing that would even be considered for core would be "add/remove comment in front of each line"

[15:52:45] <clason[m]> (adding a mapping is simple -- so simple that you can just do it yourself, so no need to have it builtin -- but making it robust is everything but.)
[15:54:12] <ShougoShougo[m]> ddc has the dark power
[15:54:22] <clason[m]> indeed!
[15:54:52] <rumpelsepp> yeah, that's probably due to my workflow. I adminstrate lots of servers and I have a plain neovim with no config most of the time. Having something builtin for commenting lines would be a live changer. Of course I can distribute my own config with mappings und stuff, but yeah. 
[15:56:21] <ShougoShougo[m]> Current Vim/neovim implementation is very very complex.

[15:58:43] <ManmeetSingh[m]> is there a way to map double press of shift key (no other keys)
[15:59:29] <ShougoShougo[m]> Shift key does not work without other keys.
[15:59:45] <ShougoShougo[m]> It is possible in GUI.  But it is not possible in CUI.
[15:59:49] <rumpelsepp> ShougoShougo[m]: yeah. I was assuming that add/remove a commentchar in front of the line is simple and beneficial enough. But I don't know how complex this goes in the end. 
[15:59:53] <ShougoShougo[m]> So Vim/neovim cannot support the feature
[16:00:10] <clason[m]> but there are system utilities that can make double-shift emit an actual key

[16:01:19] <ShougoShougo[m]> Hm.
[16:01:48] <ShougoShougo[m]> If the feature is really needed you can create the PR and you can appeal that it is simple.
[16:01:50] <bfredl> you can take the deep route and use Ibus or some other IME framework (and then fight toolkits disabusing IME events). this is what I did.
[16:02:18] <ShougoShougo[m]> (I don't it is really simple though.  I may mistake)

[16:03:11] <ManmeetSingh[m]> ShougoShougo[m]: yeah understandable
[16:03:11] <bfredl> the problem is that you can "simply" support a few simple languages, like those just using #. but then all the lang users will knock on our door and expect us to support them as well.
[16:03:20] <bfredl> if you give someone a finger..
[16:03:28] <clason[m]> and then they want block comments
[16:03:34] <clason[m]> and idempotence

[16:04:35] <ShougoShougo[m]> It should be built in really??

[17:16:31] <jaawerth> DRY isn't about optimization, it's about code maintenance. all requires are cached on `package.loaded` by lua's require system anyway so the loaders will only be invoked once unless deleted from the cache or other tomfoolery occurs
[17:17:03] <clason[m]> yes, but you don't want to require this until you need it

Sometimes they work, sometimes they fail silently, sometimes they fail with E388. If I don't use the `[`/`]` prefix, e.g. if I use `<leader>lk` and `<leader>lj` instead, they work just fine. I'm using `vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap` in Lua to set them up. Any ideas where to start poking to figure out

[21:58:55] <dmitmel[m]>  * the easymotion plugin modifies buffer contents to show its jump markers, which the Language Server client interprets as a text edit. the "simple" solution is to switch to whatever-that-plugin-for-neovim-was-named (also I personally recommend vim-sneak)
[21:59:34] <dmitmel[m]> the newer plugins generally use extmarks with virtual text. this mechanism does not modify the buffer text, but instead only influences how it is drawn.

[23:06:19] <mjlbach[m]> Ideally also completion plugins would use virtual text instead of inserting true text until "confirmed"
[23:06:38] <mjlbach[m]> I think this would be viable with virtual lines now
