[01:10:29] <tabakhase> dont they get killed & restarted/recreated?
[01:12:42] <tabakhase> may not been docker itself but external tooling that did that tho.. actually not sure D:
[01:13:20] <tianon> if it's "just" a container ("docker run", "docker-compose", etc), I don't think the health checks do anything except populate metadata in "docker container inspect"
[01:13:41] <tianon> if it's a container in a swarm service, that's where healthchecks do more, IIRC

[01:34:33] <tianon> heh, "on-unhealthy" is a suggestion in https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/28400#issuecomment-954850872
[01:35:42] <tianon> I think the problem with it being a "restart policy" is that all the other restart policies are about what to do when the container is stopped (essentially whether/when to *start* it again) where this is going to be more of an active "stop and maybe even kill this container if it becomes unhealthy"
[01:37:45] <programmerq> adac if you have a script that the HEALTHCHECK calls to, that script could send an appropriate signal to the main process to cause it to exit should it really need to be restarted. You wouldn't get the benefit of the retry count that Docker keeps track of, unfortunately. it might be handy depending on your exact usecase so it's worth a mention.
[01:38:07] <tianon> the classic "kill 1" :D
[01:38:39] <adac> alright thanks a lot guys for the awesome propsals!
[01:39:07] <programmerq> or bite the bullet and swap over to swarm mode. it's included in docker anyway.
[01:42:04] <adac> programmerq, I think I will move soon to kubernetes with mz stuff. But still not so soon that I can go without a healh/restart mechanism in my docker-compose
[01:43:44] <programmerq> yup, switching to kube isn't too bad from the end-user perspective. you can use a tool like kompose to help with your compose projects too.

[01:55:41] <rob`> Hi, I'm very new to Docker, and I've just gotten an RHEL7 system put in my lap with a bunch of docker containers. They appear to start up with the correct programs (mysql, tomcat, a raft of other stuff) but most of them are spamming gigabytes worth of log lines with "s6-supervise mysqld: warning: can't happen: timeout while the service is up!". I'm not sure why s6 would be starting the program and failing in 
[01:55:48] <rob`> this way. Am I missing something obvious?
[01:58:00] <rob`> probably more a question for the s6 people
[01:58:14] <programmerq> sounds like someone configured s6 incorrectly in those containers. normally a container is recreated using the original set of scripts/compose file/similar to make changes or swap to a newer container image. Look for evidence of how those existing containers were deployed-- on the filesystem on the server, or in a git repo that the previous person might have used, etc...
[01:58:28] * rob` nods
[01:58:54] <programmerq> so you'll need to figure out both how to redeploy the containers, and what changes to make to the s6 config. Hopefully your predecessor didn't do anything too opaque.

[12:58:26] <tabakhase> GrayShade not sure what firewall-cmd is - but "for the host" thats pretty much just like a LAN port that also does sNAT (for container->internet)

[22:49:40] <ada_> ananke: IMO docker-compose isn't really the best tool to drive building images.  it works really well as a frontend to `docker run`, but I think for your use case wrapping `docker build` in a script is probably the right way to go
[22:50:12] <ada_> you might also look at the `docker buildx` tool
[22:50:37] <ada_> https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/#build-multi-platform-images
[22:51:13] <ananke> ada_: thanks. I was hoping there was a native solution in the docker ecosystem, rather than having a crude shell script
[22:51:34] <ada_> shell is crude?
[22:51:41] <ananke> _my shell scripts_ are :)
[22:52:21] <ananke> and more to the point, I was eluded by the elegance and simplicity of adding the 'platform' option in docker-compose, that's why I thought there is also a way to do it with docker compose

[23:38:23] <BSaboia> Namely, I have a docker image which is a node.js app. Every time I need to change something, it needs to copy the new files again. However, if I do i.e docker compose up --build, it is going to rebuild the npm i part, which in this case I definitely don't need, but it is super slow
[23:38:33] <BSaboia> So I just want to by-pass this layer
