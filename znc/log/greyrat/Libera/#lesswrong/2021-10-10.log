[00:17:59] <Robomot> Interview with Aella, Part I - LessWrong (Cross-posted from Putanumonit.)
[00:19:10] <catern> her parents are prominent evangelical christians, she said in some tweet
[00:20:50] <gwern> prominent? gee. they must be so ashamed
[00:25:05] <gwern> I mean, of the deadly sins, the only ones aella hasn't truly excelled at a world-class level at would have to be sloth
[00:25:40] <gwern> (and arguably there her utter disinterest in religion qualifies more than adequately for the more refined interpretations of acedia/sloth)
[00:25:54] <gwern> (she satisfies Wrath with all her twitter trolling, obviously)
[00:29:20] <kuudes> saturn2, yes, that is why they are cheap and upswing can be high
[00:29:25] <catern> hmm I wonder if she deleted the tweet, I can't find it; specifically it was her saying that she has to avoid mentioning anything about her parents because in evangelical circles they are prominent enough that people email them saying "hey I met your daughter"
[00:29:33] <kuudes> the point is to get bets where you can fire and forget
[00:29:39] <kuudes> ie options you can hold to term
[00:29:59] <catern> ah here we go https://twitter.com/Aella_Girl/status/1446643063829508099
[00:30:00] <|dbotdan> Aella (@Aella_Girl, 2021-10-09 01:05): ‘one thing i hate more than anything is that if i go reveal my (birth) name to any hardcore evangelical christian/group anywhere they immediately go email my parents to let me know they talked to me and what i said and what i was like. It's like a giant spy network’

[00:31:07] <kuudes> don't they settle it for the money?
[00:31:22] <kuudes> oh yeah, you have to excercise it
[00:31:26] <ivan> let's say you bought just one call on GOOG and you end up a winner (GOOG is above the strike price)
[00:31:47] <ivan> it's 4:15 PM EST on expiration day and you didn't call your broker or anything
[00:32:14] <kuudes> yeah, you lose the thing if you don't exercise it
[00:32:24] <ivan> your broker will automatically call 100 shares of GOOG for you and you have like a $280K margin call
[00:32:45] <ivan> enjoy

[00:34:03] <kuudes> this is why I don't do mostly anything
[00:34:04] <gwern> this might make a good aella poll: which of the seven deadly sins does she *least* exemplify
[00:34:08] <ivan> kuudes: warrants are like calls but function as stock
[00:34:28] <ivan> kuudes: just buy cloudflare stock thanks
[00:34:35] <kuudes> so they get settled for money at the term?
[00:34:41] <kuudes> I don't want to buy most any stock.
[00:35:08] <kuudes> as said, I am otherwise perfectly happy with just normal indexes and housing loan
[00:35:31] <kuudes> I don't need to actively invest for pension or healthcare or insurance

[00:36:01] <feep> slowbomot
[00:36:05] <kuudes> I would otherwise buy annuities but they are not sold in finland generally
[00:36:15] <kuudes> so I would need to buy them from abroad, which is more complex
[00:36:31] <kuudes> ivan, what's your point? why should I buy cloudflare?
[00:38:03] <catern> feep: classic "You’re struggling with akrasia. You have insight into your condition. You pity people who don’t even know to call it “akrasia”. You have not done anything in months."
[00:38:43] <kuudes> saturn2, but as ivan apparently demonstrated, I guess I have too much risk for typos and misunderstandings
[00:39:01] <kuudes> typo risk is >1/100 for me empirically :-p
[00:40:08] <catern> feep: also classic "Everyone you know is talking about the end of the world. They say they are worried. They talk about it a lot. They barely talk about anything else. It seems like they are having so much fun. They say they are worried. They only chant dark rituals sometimes."
[00:41:48] <ivan> kuudes: I suggest buying stock that 1) a lot of other people will want to buy later 2) has reflexivity effects in that stock going up helps company hire & stuff (thus feedback loop), 3) doing so on a _down day_ after a crash or when everyone is sad
[00:42:04] <kuudes> that has too little leverage
[00:42:10] <ivan> what
[00:42:18] <kuudes> the stock base price is dead weight
[00:42:42] <kuudes> I want to be able to bet 1:X where I will lose my 1 in case I was wrong and gain X if I was right
[00:42:58] <kuudes> with the smallest possible transaction cost
[00:43:02] <ivan> > I guess I have too much risk for typos and misunderstandings
[00:43:09] <gwern> ivan: oh, is that it? damn, so that's what I've been doing wrong, buying stocks that only a few other people will want to buy later. I'll stop doing that
[00:43:20] <ivan> if company can go up another 4-10x, just get over it and buy the dead weight
[00:43:36] <kuudes> why not just buy warrant instead then?
[00:43:40] <ivan> gwern: it's an easy mistake to make with value stocks. there are too many tickers
[00:44:05] <kuudes> I want to make maybe 10 trades per year.
[00:44:11] <kuudes> at most
[00:44:18] <ivan> stocks go up when other people wanna buy (or robots are getting fooled by signals)
[00:44:46] <kuudes> I can buy index funds without purchase fee or minimum lot
[00:45:01] <kuudes> so I can just put small sum to each on each day
[00:45:15] <kuudes> with constant repeating transactions from my bank account
[00:45:32] <kuudes> that is the 999/1000
[00:46:00] <kuudes> the 1/1000 is the thing where I try to actually beat the market. and expectation is against anyone beating the market
[00:46:14] <kuudes> if I did not expect to beat the market, I should just invest to the index
[00:46:48] <kuudes> I can't sanely expect to beat the market in everything. but I might be able to beat the market in some fringe trades where I happen to have information advantage over the whole world at least some times
[00:46:54] <ivan> buy calls on HLTH and #pray
[00:47:02] <kuudes> what
[00:47:08] <kuudes> I don't know what is HLTH
[00:47:21] <kuudes> why would I therefore have information advantage over the world on that?
[00:47:45] <ivan> you are right. if you have real information advantage you should do those things. which companies and industries do you know? are they over or undervalued?
[00:47:52] <kuudes> I don't
[00:48:21] <ivan> ok, it sounds like you should either do nothing or gamble with other people's ideas from like seekingalpha or whatever (check their track record)
[00:48:44] <kuudes> previously I have had a less wrong guess that swiss franc was about to get revaluated toward euro in some months after the general vote about requiring the central bank to stop its peg to euro
[00:48:53] <kuudes> I guessed it was 10% likely
[00:49:00] <kuudes> it seems market guessed it << 10%
[00:49:04] <ivan> sounds like forex with 100x leverage is for you
[00:49:05] <kuudes> but it happened
[00:49:18] <kuudes> indeed, that would have been a good thing re that
[00:49:34] <kuudes> my best alternative was to ponder to take a loan in euro and save it in francs
[00:49:47] <kuudes> but I didn't, as I considered the costs too large
[00:50:02] <kuudes> when it happened, the rate jumped by 30%
[00:50:57] <ivan> the hard part is to actually do a lot of the trade when you're right and it's not in the price yet
[00:51:09] <kuudes> another was that I observed nordea to start to behave somewhat oddly - they had negative news of themselves in news and started complete overhaul of their e-banking platform and a couple of other things, and their chairman went to public with controversial political propositions
[00:51:17] <kuudes> yes

[00:51:55] <kuudes> so in nordea case I managed to actually buy some warrants for price of 0.02 per each. I could maybe have got them to the 0.01 which was the market price before my bid, but I got lazy
[00:52:43] <kuudes> they didn't succeed, but indeed it was revealed before the end duration of the warrant that nordea had been in talks with a netherlandish bank for the netherlandish bank to buy it, but their price negotiations had fell through
[00:53:05] <kuudes> in case that trade would have happened, those warrants would have been maybe 0.50 or 2.00 worth
[00:53:23] <kuudes> that sort of information I am talking about
[00:53:34] <kuudes> not daytrade, not opinions for each and every company all the time
[00:53:54] <kuudes> but some more complex narrative that appears to not be yet priced in on the market

[01:28:31] <catern> it's kind of weird that the internet archive is so slow

[01:29:03] <catern> (excess load on IA I think would be one reason to not automatically request the archive whenever you see a 404)
[01:29:06] <adiabatic> as opposed to powered-down hard disks
[01:29:28] <ivan> IA disks are spun up but there's just too much IO
[01:29:41] <gwern> catern: brave could cache that. no, the real problem would be leaking user browsing behavior and also deciding what even *is* a 'useful' archive
[01:30:00] <ivan> cloudflare cache hit ratio on wayback would probably be pretty bad
[01:30:10] <adiabatic> ^
[01:30:26] <adiabatic> the wayback machine is probably mostly long tail. like, even more so than everything else
[01:30:59] <gwern> even if you cache a lookup of each URL to see if the IA has any snapshot of it and tell the user "there is a snapshot of this 404 on IA, want to look at its last version?", you may well just be pointing them at a broken version! in fact, my experience has been that the last version is usually the worst snapshot
[01:31:04] <catern> gwern: you mean brave operating their own servers as a cache in front of IA? sure I guess, but I think most CDNs would love to give it for free, and maybe even integrate it. but good point about leaking user browsing behavior, hmm, tricky I suppose. although that already happens with CDNs
[01:32:02] <gwern> (because the last one is an error page, a redirect to the homepage, a domain squatter, or just an extremely degraded version missing images or with extra JS malware and ads stuffed into it or a moving-paywall-truncated version or...)

[01:58:20] <Robomot> So Brave | Know Your Meme (“So Brave” is a sarcastic expression used to dismiss a comment or patronize someone for falling in line with popular opinions on the social news site Reddit. …)
[01:58:45] <shawwwn> Because I think I got into a fight with feep, who intentionally was a fucker to me for no reason
[01:59:02] <shawwwn> So let's get our facts straight, along with the paper trail.
[01:59:07] <shawwwn> Now then
[01:59:44] <shawwwn> If you wonder why I came in and made this a point, it's because I don't need people disagreeing with my experience as a victim. Pretend it was about sexual assault instead of merely a character attack. I think you'd see why that's not cool
[02:00:27] <shawwwn> So I wanted to come in and clarify what was going on. And since gwern's disagreement was quite public, I feel zero shame about doing it here rather than in /msg.
[02:00:38] <catern> pretend it was for saying "climate change is an important global issue" and you'll get a more realistic perspective
[02:00:40] <shawwwn> If your paper trail wants to crucify me for that, then go right ahead.
[02:00:51] <feep> no I just
[02:00:52] <feep> like
[02:01:07] <feep> a year ago I said "are you a furry? because holy shit you have an amazing propensity for drama"
[02:01:22] <catern> homg is dat some dramas
[02:01:37] <feep> I'm trying to document a model of how your set of personality traits leads to meltdowns
[02:01:49] *** Betawolf_ is now known as Betawolf
[02:01:54] <feep> I don't have a super stable theory of this yet
[02:02:40] <feep> I just ... like, later on, when you start shit with someone who can escalate higher, I want to have it established that I saw it coming.

[02:09:54] <feep> lol @ picture
[02:10:22] <shawwwn> Try to remind yourself that you're doing the equivalent of mocking a victim of sexual assault who came in and had a problem with someone disagreeing that they needed to stay quiet or else they'd get attacked.
[02:10:33] <feep> e ... 926? did something happen to e621? was it a drama
[02:10:53] <catern> e926 is the sfw version of e621
[02:11:09] <feep> shawwwn: the fact that you're trying to equivocate "gwern used the word 'disagree' at me on twitter" with sexual assault does not exactly make you come off better here.
[02:11:46] <shawwwn> Not only am I not doing that, but you've consistently come in today and misunderstood every single one of my arguments. As for whether it's intentional misunderstanding, I'm not sure yet
[02:12:02] <feep> oh hang on yeah you're right, that was incorrect
[02:12:08] <feep> I misunderstood your analogy
[02:12:26] <shawwwn> okay. That said, feel free to mock as much as you want. I just wanted you to be aware of where I'm coming from.
[02:13:08] <feep> shawwwn: okay, trying to phrase it positively: if you gave *examples* of you being attacked over agi it would be a lot more convincing
[02:13:24] <catern> (in shawwwn's defense, he did give one in the original tweet he linked)
[02:13:31] <shawwwn> Ah. I see the confusion. (Yes, but I didn't link it directly here)
[02:13:47] <shawwwn> so I don't blame feep at all, doubly so because it's twitter and it's annoying to read threads
[02:13:52] <feep> okay, but that's barely an attack though.
[02:13:53] <Betawolf> remember that telling feep to eat shit is exactly like telling a rape victim to eat shit.
[02:14:01] <shawwwn> the context was https://twitter.com/theshawwn/status/1446903884564283394
[02:14:03] <|dbotdan> Shawn Presser (@theshawwn, 2021-10-09 18:22): ‘This was one of the more hurtful tweets I've received, because I've always worried that I might turn into the type of twitter'er described here. | I wondered why. And then I realized: This is why colleagues stay quiet when they believe AGI is nonsense. You'll get attacked.’ Images: https://nitter.1d4.us/pic/media%2FFBRug1fXIAMdWai.png%3Fname%3Dorig
[02:14:03] <|dbotdan> (description: text; confidence: 0.57)
[02:14:26] <shawwwn> "Barely an attack" is still an attack, and I was shocked that it came from one of my long time mutuals
[02:14:31] <Betawolf> shawwwn: what sort of monster are you? Would you really do that to a rape victim?
[02:14:35] <feep> shawwwn: yeah okay, to be clear, as attack goes that's not just weaksauce, that's a lot more weaksauce than the shit you have thrown at me in this channel over the last half hour.
[02:14:55] <shawwwn> I never attacked you, feep. I stuck up for myself when you tried to bully me.
[02:15:08] <feep> ah yeah you "stuck up for yourself" by literally telling me to eat shit.
[02:15:20] <feep> we stick up for our rights, they attack our beliefs
[02:15:41] <feep> like, there's a thing where
[02:15:49] <shawwwn> Do you disagree you were bullying me?
[02:15:56] <feep> yes? I completely disagree
[02:16:04] <Betawolf> pls don't disagree with shawwn that's a hate crime.
[02:16:17] <feep> anyway, I don't think there's a term for this, there was once a really long post using mtg analogies
[02:16:31] <shawwwn> Let's not "anyway." Which part do you disagree with? How was it not?
[02:16:40] <feep> but there's a personality trait where you want to be right more than successful, and part of that can involve catalyzing disagreement so you can confirm your opinion that everyone hates you
[02:16:54] <feep> I literally do not think I bullied you at any point.
[02:17:05] <shawwwn> I understand you feel that way. For what it's worth, I empathize with your confusion
[02:17:14] <shawwwn> I've had similar feelings in other social situations
[02:17:23] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:17:29] <feep> in implementation, there's two halves to this: extreme thinskinnedness and extreme aggressiveness
[02:17:38] <feep> they sort of form a toxoplasma cycle
[02:17:58] <shawwwn> But you can see how, when someone comes in and starts talking about their experiences as someone who was just attacked, and then you saying that it was "just drama" -- how that could be classified as bullying.
[02:18:08] <shawwwn> if not, then I suppose we'll agree to disagree.
[02:18:10] <feep> no I do not agree that could be classified as bullying
[02:18:23] <shawwwn> Okay. Because it's exactly the same as the type of things that happened to me in gradeschool for years.
[02:18:31] <feep> and I think the attempt to classify that as bullying is part of the process
[02:18:35] <shawwwn> That was the #1 thing the bullies did the moment I started complaining
[02:18:43] <shawwwn> Minimize the complaint
[02:18:50] <shawwwn> Imply that the problem is me, not them
[02:18:58] <feep> there's something funny here about my experience in grade school
[02:18:58] <Betawolf> feep: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder maybe subclinical
[02:19:11] <feepbot> Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) or megalomania is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of exaggerated feelings of self-importance, an excessive craving for admiration, and struggles with empathy.
[02:19:14] <feep> let's not get into it tho
[02:19:21] <catern> (i'm just glad I found this image again, it's a classic (SFW, same as I linked above) https://static1.e926.net/data/a0/c0/a0c0215a47df960391aac3a828c74a6a.jpg )
[02:19:26] <Robomot> image/jpeg (600x806; 91 KB)
[02:19:53] <shawwwn> I think catern is proving the point.
[02:20:05] <feep> shawwwn: right, and ... I think maybe part of it is that you're ending up in ... like
[02:20:08] <shawwwn> Anyway. Feel free.
[02:20:11] <feep> if there was a way to have self-confirming personality traits
[02:20:19] <feep> like, traits that catalyzed reactions that reinforced them
[02:20:34] <feep> you'd expect these traits to become endemic, right?
[02:20:50] * feep blinks
[02:20:51] <shawwwn> The thing is, I'm happy to psychoanalyze me as much as you'd like. But just so we're clear, you were the one who started the analysis, not me. I merely asked gwern which part he disagreed with
[02:20:55] <feep> that word did not mean what I think it means
[02:21:08] <feep> shawwwn: I started the analysis because you were doing the thing
[02:21:26] <feep> and I think the thing is going to be bad for the channel and the community, and it's just a question of how bad :p
[02:21:39] <kuudes> anyone for a game of chess?
[02:21:43] <shawwwn> Yes. I'm certain that the badness will be weighed appropriately
[02:21:50] <shawwwn> hopefully the judge is impartial.
[02:21:58] <shawwwn> Either way, I'm not worried.
[02:22:03] <feep> I mean like, there's a scale here that starts with "you chill out" and caps out at "the police were called"
[02:22:18] <feep> and I'm genuinely unsure where on the scale things will end up, years from now
[02:22:32] <shawwwn> awe. you feel I'll be around in years
[02:22:36] <shawwwn> that's cute.
[02:22:44] <feep> lindy, right?
[02:22:57] <shawwwn> .note feep in 2y is shawwwn still around? you said he'd be around for years; just checking.
[02:24:01] <feep> shawwwn: anyway in summary I think people attacking you is a thing that you are *not* responsible for, but that is part of a system that is in part created by your perceptions and behaviors.
[02:24:48] <shawwwn> Ah. Yes, I agree. A behavior such as "having an opinion" and "expressing that opinion on twitter." For what it's worth, I wasn't unprepared to be attacked in response
[02:24:49] <feep> and that my prediction is if you tried to work on being more thick-skinned and chill, you would end up with *superlinearly* less being attacked.
[02:24:57] <shawwwn> I didn't "mind" it
[02:25:14] <shawwwn> my tweet was expressing disappointment that it came from a long time mutual
[02:25:23] <shawwwn> (well, that was the underlying emotion, anyway.)
[02:25:34] <shawwwn> and then gwern comes in and makes it all about him, not me.
[02:25:39] <shawwwn> on my twitter.
[02:25:46] <feep> what I saw was that you came here and scratched at gwern for being insufficiently supportive
[02:25:58] <feep> and then scratched at everyone who was like "maybe chill out" and "geez"
[02:26:00] <shawwwn> my options were to escalate it publicly about gwern on twitter, or come in here and escalate it publicly about gwern on #lesswrong
[02:26:10] <shawwwn> since I didn't want to do that to gwern publicly, I decided to do it here publicly.
[02:26:13] <feep> um, your options also included not doing any of that
[02:26:34] <shawwwn> Yes, but that would be enabling the behavior.
[02:26:38] <feep> again, to be clear, as opposed to bullying, my prediction is if you *lower* your aggression you will experience *less* attacks.
[02:27:19] <shawwwn> The attack was because I was wagering my life savings about whether AGI will be invented. And the attack referenced an argument I made about why I felt that AGI was unlikely to be invented.
[02:27:24] <shawwwn> I don't understand which of these is aggressive.
[02:27:35] <feep> no um the aggressive part is literally telling me to eat shit lol.
[02:28:13] <shawwwn> hehe. Well, that was just defending myself from the bullying, as I said. But I'm happy we analyzed it out.
[02:28:22] <catern> shawwwn: gwern answered your question, you're just being obtuse for some reason; he clearly disagrees with the part I quoted
[02:28:24] <shawwwn> Anyway. Sorry for interrupting the weekend.
[02:28:42] <shawwwn> well, I was getting to that. The part you quoted didn't claim anything about baseline attack rates
[02:28:57] <shawwwn> It claimed that colleagues exist who stay quiet because they fear reprisals.
[02:29:02] <feep> well hey~ I tried.
[02:29:39] <catern> "people don't do X because Y will happen if they do X" implies that P(Y|X) > P(Y|not X)
[02:30:14] <shawwwn> I'm not smart enough to understand that. But a data point of one (me) is still a data point in the set of all colleagues. And I stayed quiet for a long time for precisely these reasons
[02:30:51] <catern> btw, I ended up ordering a mochaccino at my coffee adventure
[02:30:55] <catern> it was okay
[02:30:56] <shawwwn> oh cool
[02:31:08] <shawwwn> I really wish I liked coffee more
[02:31:13] <shawwwn> but you have to drown it in half and half
[02:31:14] <catern> thanks rmmh for the suggestion
[02:31:21] <shawwwn> still, when you do, it's delicious
[02:31:30] <shawwwn> also the ice cream coffee from starbucks. But it's basically just ice cream
[02:31:33] <shawwwn> which isn't exactly great to eat.
[02:31:34] <rmmh> my hot chocolate suggestion? Lol
[02:32:05] <catern> rmmh: yes I considered it but I ended up just getting it normal-style, i.e. containing coffee

[04:42:29] <rsaarelm> Morning crackpot thought: Julian Jaynes was entirely right and the reason we don't see bicameral people along hunter-gatherers in the modern era is because Rupert Sheldrake was also entirely right and the axial age affected the planet-wide morphological field of humans and enacted non-causal cognitive evolution
[04:43:59] <quanticle> rsaarelm: whut
[04:44:19] <rsaarelm> I don't know, this stuff just shows up in my head when I wake up in the morning.
[04:45:14] <nshepperd2> probably just rsaarelm's region of the morphological field acting up, pay it no mind
[04:46:55] <quanticle> No, let me clarify my "whut". I only understood like... the first third of that sentence. Who is Rupert Sheldrake? I know of the "axial age", but I only know of it from Graeber's _Debt: The First 5000 Years_, where he refers to early civilizations as "axial age empires". What's the connection? What the fuck is a morphological field?
[04:47:41] <quanticle> And most importantly: how deep down the rabbit hole do you have to go before you are even *capable* of having thoughts like that, crackpot or otherwise?
[04:48:39] <pompolic> i do it as a party trick sometimes
[04:48:40] <rsaarelm> Rupert Sheldrake is a British crackpot pseudoscientist who thinks animals and humans have a global telepathic field that transmits memes without direct contact. Like, if monkeys on an island learn to crack coconuts with rocks, the same species of monkeys on the mainland are going to start cracking coconuts with a rock.
[04:49:28] <quanticle> That's incredible, because the theory is so easily disproven and yet he still sticks with it.
[04:49:55] <quanticle> Usually crackpot theories at least attempt to be unfalsifiable
[04:50:54] <rsaarelm> Jaynes' bicameral people were guys right before the axial age and the axial age is widely considered as this sort of global period where remotely modernish cultural ideas first showed up to replace "hey just gather a big army and start building skull pyramids" that was pretty much civilizational standard operating procedure around the time of the Iliad.
[04:51:41] <quanticle> So... like Ancient Egypt?
[04:51:44] <rsaarelm> And Sheldrake of course thinks this is the reason why we now see stuff where suddenly a lot of scientists are working on the same scientific breakthrough.
[04:52:11] <rsaarelm> Ancient Egypt was pretty weird even compared to things like the Roman Empire.
[04:52:26] <quanticle> Wait, the *Roman Empire* counts as an _axial age_ civilization?
[04:52:35] <rsaarelm> No, it was post axial age.
[04:52:42] <quanticle> Okay
[04:52:57] <quanticle> My impression of "axial age" was like... Sumeria
[04:53:09] <rsaarelm> And it feels like something that more or less makes sense from the modern viewpoint of what people are like and how they organize societies.
[04:54:02] <saturn2> morphological fields? i don't believe they exist.
[04:54:29] <rsaarelm> I figured the Axial Age is basically Socrates' Athens, Buddha's India and whatever stuff was going on in Israel they ended writing the bible about.
[04:54:52] <rsaarelm> I'm pretty sure they don't.
[04:55:16] <nshepperd2> the morphological field is just the Wired
[04:55:28] <rsaarelm> But they'd explain Jaynes' thing if they did. Synergization of disparate crackpotteries.
[05:04:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Jaynes's stuff is much more interesting than Sheldrake's
[05:05:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sheldrake's theories are just straightforwardly wrong, Jaynes's are ... very likely wrong in the strong/literal form but have an interesting core of truth with surprisingly much explanatory power
[05:07:22] <rsaarelm> Yes.
[05:07:45] <rsaarelm> I don't think I know of any stuff from Sheldrake that isn't straight up crackpottery.

[05:55:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> That doesn't make a whole lot of sense
[05:56:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Justice must surely be contingent on effectiveness; how can a measure be just, that fails to accomplish its just intent?
[05:58:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> The correct form of that reasoning is "the more you believe in the luck of genetics, the more you should believe that people's lot in life is not due to deserts, and that it is therefore just to do things that will aid those who have been slighted by the birth lottery"
[05:58:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> What those things actually are, and whether redistribution is among them (and what form such may take), are empirical questions, not ethical ones
[05:59:53] <catern> when Robin Hanson uses the word, "redistribution" just means "change the distribution" rather than e.g. "take from one and give to another", so one could argue that you're saying the same thing

[06:01:04] <catern> Obormot\Arcturus: well... https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/redistribution#Noun The act of changing the distribution of resources
[06:01:16] <feepbot> redistribution - Wiktionary
[06:01:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> catern: At the very least, it makes no sense whatsoever to say "redistributive social programs" to mean social programs that don't at least have "take from one and give to another" as a goal
[06:01:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that's what sama said: "redistributive social programs".
[06:02:15] <catern> (I agree that to use the word "redistribution" instead of "change the distribution" is a bad idea.)
[06:02:45] <catern>  in fact, maybe we need separate words for "the act of distributing something" and "a statistical distribution"
[06:03:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> English has this problem in general
[06:03:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Many words are shared between "a process of effecting or altering some state of affairs" and "the state of affairs resulting from such a process"
[06:04:04] <shawwwn> Hm. I am forced to agree. I was going to argue that the term is more appropriate as is
[06:04:38] <shawwwn> But “re” implies the wealth has already been distributed, whereas social programs are all about

[08:39:04] <adiabatic> isn't that why you get IN the car? So the lion can't come in?
[08:40:01] <shawwwn> Can someone think of the best counter argument to “there’s no such thing as sexism towards men, because men have never had a power imbalance in favor of women”?
[08:40:22] <shawwwn> Along with “it’s okay to make biased jokes against men”
[08:40:46] <linear> is it even worth arguing against given the people that say that most frequently
[08:40:58] <shawwwn> It’s family
[08:41:32] <linear> the way I usually talk about it is first admit that there's situations where males have a huge advantage, but then mention some others where females have a huge advantage, and talk about how depending on what one does, this is very malleable
[08:41:58] <shawwwn> They’re focusing on the technical definition of sexism, and that it’s literally impossible
[08:42:04] <adiabatic> shawwwn: needs workshopping, but: women have plenty of power. try defending against a false rape accusation as a man against a woman
[08:42:32] <shawwwn> Heh. That would really blow up the night.
[08:42:39] <linear> overall it is just a very touchy thing to argue. even if you bring up things like ^ or stats on things like suicide, homelessness, workplace injuries, loneliness, and many other things
[08:42:46] <linear> it's hard to bring them up without people generally just getting upset
[08:43:22] <shawwwn> The context was that my BIL was watching “lemon stealing whores” and commented that all males who work in porn are “probably sex criminals”, but he was joking so it’s okay
[08:43:31] <saturn2> be a powerful man and just laugh at womanly whining about sexism
[08:43:48] <adiabatic> if they're saying the definition of sexism precludes woman-on-man discrimination+power, then point out that they're just twisting the definition to treat men like shit and feel good about doing so
[08:43:55] <shawwwn> I felt it was not okay, based on the fact that BIL would lose his shit if I made an equivalent joke about female porn stars
[08:45:04] <adiabatic> me, I know jack shit about the porn industry so I'd probably autistically ask him what led him to think that
[08:45:19] <shawwwn> Literally just “men bad”
[08:45:36] <shawwwn> or more particularly “men evil”, is the mindset. It’s constant jokes like that
[08:45:48] <PapuaHardyNet> you gain nothing by trying to change their mindset
[08:46:07] <adiabatic> As for how you want to tackle this, well, depends on how much drama you want that day. You're certainly not totally allergic to it… :P
[08:46:59] <adiabatic> me, I tend to kind of be a tit-for-two-or-three-tats kind of guy
[08:46:59] <shawwwn> I didn’t want to change their mindset. I wanted to point out publicly that inappropriate jokes like that aren’t okay, and could we maybe chill a little in the future, since they’d lose their minds if I made a joke like that about women.
[08:47:31] <shawwwn> The counter argument would be that jokes like that are absolutely fine, based on the fact that you cannot be sexist towards men
[08:47:35] <nshepperd2> shawwwn: the right come back to "sexism is prejudice+power" is "so you think prejudice is okay?" imo
[08:47:37] <shawwwn> So I thought I’d ask here.

[09:59:13] <shawwwn> The tiktok explains that aegosexuals refuse to do anything physical, but are attracted sexually to fantasies. So they refuse to have actual sex, only fantasies
[09:59:37] <adiabatic> yeah, that's a known kink or whatever you want to call it
[09:59:44] <shawwwn> Maybe it’s not a sexuality though
[09:59:49] <adiabatic> fancy way of saying 2d >>>> 3d
[09:59:50] <shawwwn> I actually don’t know what a sexuality is
[10:00:00] <adiabatic> don't worry, nobody else does either
[10:00:01] <shawwwn> And didn’t realize it till now
[10:00:06] <shawwwn> Hmm.
[10:00:14] <adiabatic> they're making up the definition as they go along

[10:01:32] <shawwwn> I guess I find this labeling harmless because no one was asking for special status or talking about oppression. But maybe such topics are inevitable outcomes of labels
[10:01:43] <adiabatic> yet
[10:01:47] <shawwwn> Yeah

[10:02:35] <shawwwn> But it also gives context to think about people who refuse to have actual sex, and perhaps include them in the designs of applications for… uh… it’s a bit hard to imagine a way to oppress an aegosexua
[10:02:39] <shawwwn> l
[10:02:48] <adiabatic> pester him to get a gf
[10:03:10] <shawwwn> Oh, yes. The option to be on tinder and advertise “fantasy only”
[10:03:16] <shawwwn> That’s actually not a bad idea. Hmm.
[10:03:41] <adiabatic> if you can't think of a way to pester someone who's fantasy-only you need to go to bed and wake up refreshed so you can think straight :P
[10:04:05] <adiabatic> if you're still stuck, talk to some chinese aunties or something
[10:05:17] <shawwwn> Hm. I’m actually well rested. So I suppose this is an excellent example of the reason to have a label, since I’m ignorant of ways to oppress aegosexuals. I can’t think of anything.
[10:05:32] <shawwwn> So it’s a learning opportunity for me for sure.
[10:06:14] <adiabatic> anything where "if you're not married with kids, you're not a real adult" meme
[10:06:19] <adiabatic> (very jewish!)
[10:06:29] <adiabatic> which…I am 100% on board with
[10:09:17] <shawwwn> OH
[10:09:24] <shawwwn> Yes
[10:09:44] <shawwwn> Emily (as usual) had to think of that and explain it to me before I got it
[10:09:58] <adiabatic> explain what
[10:11:29] <shawwwn> We were talking about all that convo, and I said I couldn’t think of anything, and mentioned your comment. She was like oh yeah, that was stupid of me to say (because she originally agreed) and pointed out that you can fire someone just because they’re aegosexual the same way you can fire someone just because they’re gay
[10:11:56] <shawwwn> Of course, “you fired me because I’m aegosexual” is a bit hard to justify, but it got the point across to me :)
[10:12:23] <adiabatic> isn't 'gay' a protected class nationally now
[10:16:20] <shawwwn> Yes. But it’s a sexuality. So the question is whether there’s any value in saying that aegosexuals might theoretically be oppressed (and if not, poke fun at them for trying to gain oppressed protection status)
[10:16:53] <shawwwn> So the argument is basically, yes there is value in case the world started trying to hunt down people who refuse to have sex
[10:17:21] <shawwwn> Which, you know, isn’t impossible to imagine. Catholicism feels birth control is a sin, which sort of rhymes
[10:17:29] <adiabatic> sounds like a pretext to invade some shithole country

[11:48:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> I googled "aegosexuality" after reading that tweet and it led me to this amazing wiki:
[11:48:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://lgbta.wikia.org/wiki/Pomosexual
[11:48:17] <Robomot> Pomosexual | LGBTA Wiki | Fandom (Pomosexual, also called Labeln't, refers to someone who denies or does not fit any labels for a particular kind of attraction. A pomosexual individual rejects, has an aversion to, or does not fit any sexual orientations such as gay, straight, bisexual, asexual etc. This can either be because one...)
[11:55:14] <shawwwn> That's odd. Obormot just linked to something related to the earlier conversation, but I'm not sure what he said since I have him ignored. Yet I think I was the only one talking about labels, which implies he might not have *me* ignored. Hmm.
[11:55:36] <shawwwn> Am I curious enough to unignore him to find out what precisely he said... probably not
[11:58:14] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, presumably if you were I might say the same!
[11:58:15] <feepbot> Gurkenglas: shawwwn left a note 13 minutes, 19 seconds ago: am I dreaming?
[12:00:10] <Gurkenglas> I remember someone claiming 100% probability before that I wasn't dreaming and then I proved them wrong.
[12:01:05] <Gurkenglas> I've been living off the Bayes points I made that night ever since.
[12:11:08] <shawwwn> Gurkenglas: how did you prove you were dreaming?
[12:14:20] <Gurkenglas> I turned around and pointed out two copies of a mutual acquaintance in the room.
[12:14:55] <Gurkenglas> (Did not expect to find proof by turning around.)
[12:15:26] <linear> Obormot\Arcturus: truly an amazing wiki, i am learning so many new words
[12:16:12] <Gurkenglas> (My prior was non-negligible because I had recently woken up from a matryoshka dream.)
[12:20:02] <Gurkenglas> shawwwn, consider lucid dreaming techniques for reliabler answers.
[12:20:46] <shawwwn> what are the techniques? I've always "tried" to lucid dream in my own way
[12:20:51] <shawwwn> never worked though
[12:21:48] <Gurkenglas> Get into the habit of asking yourself if you're dreaming; so far so good.
[12:23:43] <Gurkenglas> Find ways to tell. Can you read in dreams? Is dream text made up of letters? Dreams must cut corners everywhere, paint it into a corner, contradictions prove dreaming.
[12:24:13] <linear> ^ in my experience the easiest way is grinding the hell out of reality checks, but there's a lot of other methods some of which are nicer if you want to work hard
[12:26:59] <yorick> I've done this and my habitual RC's would succeed in dreams
[12:27:15] <yorick> lucidity seems to be an external factor
[12:27:29] <Gurkenglas> yorick, by succeed you mean come out the wrong way?
[12:27:32] <yorick> yeah
[12:27:45] <yorick> only deliberate "oh this could be a dream" RC's work out
[12:28:55] <yorick> my most common trigger is "I was in bed with my eyes closed, I don't remember changing that but I'm having experiences now"

[12:34:38] <rsaarelm> If you normally sleep 8 hours in a single block in a night, this has you waking yourself with an alarm clock 5 hours after you went to bed, staying up for anything between 30 minutes and a couple hours so you wake up properly, then going back to bed to sleep 3 more hours.

[17:40:15] <kuudes> but I wonder if china wants to play with "we are not a developing country"/"we are a developing country" hypocricy game
[17:40:54] <kuudes> ie if moderna's or pfizer's ip was temporarily ordered mooted, who would actually produce the doses?
[17:41:04] <kuudes> and who would pay whom and how much?
[17:43:47] <mjr> Yeah I've been given to understand that part of the problem was getting enough manufacturing capacity for mRNA vaccines (and components thereof) online in the first place.

[20:45:50] <feepbot> <gwern> 'Our analyses reveal two main findings. First, the similarity between brain responses and the activations of language models primarily depends on their ability to predict words from the context. Second, this similarity allows us to decompose and precisely track the rise and maintenance of perceptual, lexical, and compositional representations within each cortical region.
[20:45:50] <feepbot> Overall, this study evidences a partial convergence of language transformers to brainlike solutions, and shows how this phenomenon helps unravel the brain bases of natural language processing.' https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03361439/
