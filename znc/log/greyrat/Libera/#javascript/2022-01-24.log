Say I have an object O which has a property O.a pointing to a which is set from A2. Why, when outputting O, the index of a as a property of O is that of A2, whereas when outputting O.a, its index is that in A1 ?

[02:42:04] <systemfault> A snippet of code is worth 1000 words.
[02:42:45] <hmw[at]> s/words/comments   ??
[02:42:48] <ljharb> hopefully not that many, code should be short :-p
[02:42:53] <ljharb> and should have no comments
[02:43:09] <bobdobbs> In React: I want to create a component and provide a style object to apply css rules to that component. Do I create the style object somewhere within the class definition? How?
[02:43:37] <oscurochu> you can create the style as a javascript object
[02:43:45] <ljharb> xaltsc: show code, but my bet is that you don‚Äôt realize that no objects in js are copied, and you‚Äôre mutating one and not realizing the other is the same object
[02:44:18] <oscurochu> bobdobbs you can also import the stylesheet also.
[02:45:03] <SpiceMan> n> let a1 = [1,2]; let a2 = a1; a2.push(3); a1
[02:45:05] <jellobot> (okay) [ 1, 2, 3 ]
[02:45:08] <ljharb> gross tho, importing css is not a good idea
[02:45:10] <SpiceMan> xaltsc: ^ this?
[02:45:53] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: ah, I think I found a code snippet that demonstrates what I'm trying to figure out: http://pastie.org/p/3BfChDeaSvEGWBId7YJGVT
[02:46:07] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: from a w3schools tut
[02:46:51] <bobdobbs> I think the answer I was looking for was "do it inside the render method"
[02:46:53] <oscurochu> i think what you are looking for is className, but im not sure. i dont mess with css much. css is very unopinionated when it comes to react however
[02:47:00] <xaltsc> My code would be too long :D, and the mutation is done in a library (cola.js). The thing is that I wanted to have the analogue of pointers in order to reduce an O(n^2) function to O(1), in order to do so, I extract a subarray without creating new objects (and indexes change there). But JS/TS don't have true pointers afaik, so it's a bit hard to understand what happens
[02:47:36] <oscurochu> bobdobbs it doesnt have to be in the render method, as long as the css is accessible in the current scope
[02:47:47] <ljharb> bobdobbs: eesh, don‚Äôt use w3schools

[02:50:09] <bobdobbs> oscurochu: I think I'd prefer to do it outside of the render method, just to keep that method more readable. But I'm getting an error when defining it outside the method. One sec, I'll pastebin what I'm trying to do...

[04:00:49] <ljharb> oscurochu: a click handler could take a `setState`, but it shouldn't take a `useState`
[04:01:00] <ljharb> oscurochu: in particular because hooks must always run unconditionally, the same number of times

[04:01:47] <oscurochu> its a variable, not an actual hook. maybe the naming is confusing.

[09:28:00] <dave0> rama: what do you think of it so far?
[09:28:00] <Stinger> in Promise.all if one Promise rejects will all the remaining promises resolve (if they are able)
[09:28:01] <systemfault> oscurochu: Nah, you can actually write React without that XML stuff (It's just that nobody does it)
[09:28:10] <oscurochu> i loved react. but right now its giving me a headache too.
[09:28:37] <systemfault> oscurochu: That weird XML syntax in JS is called JSX
[09:28:45] <silly> you either use `export default ABIIndex` and `import hardhat_abis from '../abis/hardhat'` or `export { contactAddress, FakeNFT, Kasu }` and `import * as hardhat_abis from ...`
[09:28:51] <oscurochu> i think its distracting. i've overused the heck out of it.
[09:29:15] <rama> dave0: i write backends with Flask as my dayjob, so im finding it a bit fusterating, but there is also a langauge barrier that i have with JS.. only a couple days in so far... im sure ill get the hang of it sooner or later

[09:30:11] <oscurochu> i find myself inside of a text file, describing the hierarchy of my program, with what sort of looks like xml. thats where i came up with the question.
[09:30:44] <oscurochu> i dont know where things end or where they begin. so this was my solution i just came up with to help me put all the peices back together.
[09:31:54] <silly> Stinger, "Promise.all() will reject immediately upon any of the input promises rejecting." https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all

[09:33:18] <rama> bullets flying
[09:34:42] <Stinger> it will reject, but will all of the promises still be running in the background?
[09:35:43] <Stinger> performing whatever calculations were kicked off? I dont think promises are typically cancellable
[09:36:36] <Stinger> you know what I'll just test it
[09:36:37] <Stinger> :P
[09:36:47] <rama> is there a way to make a class property from a class method? in python we use a decorator @property which lets you do MyClass.foo rather than MyClass.foo()

[09:54:08] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I'm still on the React learning train. I just hit a problem and I'm not sure how to think about it...
[09:55:52] <bobdobbs> So I've figured out how to create components from classes and how to render them. Let's say I want to get all existing blog posts and pass in their data to components that are instances of the Article class...
[09:56:48] <bobdobbs> How do I actually do that? Like how do I implement the logic "for each dataset, render an Article?"
[09:58:50] <bobdobbs> Would I maybe create a function that renders an Article, and use that function as a callback inside a map function?
[10:00:13] <systemfault> You create "components" so you can ".map" an array of article object to <Article> components
[10:01:46] <bobdobbs> systemfault: sorry man, I'm having a little trouble digesting that sentence
[10:02:24] <bobdobbs> oh wait... I think I get it. Is it equivalent to what I suggested?

[12:44:04] <Simplar> Decker: but it's seeming antipattern
[12:44:08] <entropygain> how do you guys use axios for protected API calls?
[12:44:25] <Simplar> entropygain: I let the backend middleware handle the protection
[12:44:30] <entropygain> we were trying to make a component which wraps a bunch of children (pretty much the entire app)
[12:44:46] <entropygain> well more-so what i meant was using the interceptor
[12:44:49] <entropygain> to add the token
[12:44:54] <entropygain> before a call is made
[12:45:10] <entropygain> so while i can do that in the use effect in this parent Axios component
[12:45:32] <entropygain> and thus make it that any axios calls from there on are all including the token
[12:46:03] <entropygain> the useEffect on my Axios parent fires twice ... 1ce where isAuthenticated is false and then another when isAuthenticated is true
[12:46:12] <entropygain> the second time is when i add the axios interceptor
[12:46:34] <entropygain> however between this first and second useEffect ... one of my child components is trying to make an API call
[12:46:57] <entropygain> thus it ends up making it without the token before it has been added
[12:47:01] <entropygain> I am not really sure what to do her

[12:47:06] <entropygain> here*
[12:47:11] <Simplar> Why intercept when you can assign the API auth token for each instance?
[12:47:31] <Simplar> like, when the user is logged in, assign auth token to an instance, when the user is logged out, null it

[12:49:18] <entropygain> when do I add the auth token to the instance?

[22:20:10] <mknod> Hello. I'm in the process of refactoring the code I've been writing for the past few weeks... Almost done with it but there are a few minor questions left.
[22:20:15] <eXtr3m0> diverdude for security reasons communication between iframes is restricted (especially cross-domain). Otherwise, you could just show a blank page with an iframe pointing to facebook.com and then read all the personal data if a user logs into his account within the iframe.

[22:20:21] *** Quits: Zauberfisch (~Zauberfis@cm147-42.liwest.at) ()
[22:21:46] <mknod> Do you always declare your variables at the top of your functions body, despite hoisting, or wherever and whenever you need them? I usually do the former in most other languages I've played with, but in JS it feels kind of more natural to declare them when I need them. Should I even care if I'm ok with the code readability?
[22:22:22] <systemfault> mknod: You declare your variables where you need them.
[22:22:50] <systemfault> mknod: Hoisting of variables is not really a problem if you use let/const (There are gotchas... but...)
[22:23:11] <systemfault> Readability is the most important thing.
[22:23:42] <systemfault> If you see some website telling you to declare your variables at the top of your functions, it's because it's old and it probably uses "var"
[22:24:32] <mknod> systemfault, interesting, hence my second question:
[22:25:16] <mknod> const vs. var: as I never wrote JS before, I kept this for later. I basically stuck to var except for config variables and unless I really needed block scoping. But now I realise most of my variables are actually constants. The const keyword is pretty new IIRC, so I'm wondering if I should leave it as-is or batch replace those declaration for the sake of "correctness". Any thoughts?
[22:25:32] *** Joins: zauberfisch (~Zauberfis@cm147-42.liwest.at)
[22:25:40] <systemfault> "const" should be your default
[22:25:56] <mknod> What I expected.
[22:25:59] <systemfault> Then, if you ever need to reassign, you switch to a let
[22:26:14] <mknod> Ah, so var is really obsolete now?
[22:26:23] *** Joins: sam_1 (~sam_1@89.150.128.114)
[22:26:26] <systemfault> Because "const" doesn't mean that the data is immutable or anything... it means "cannot be reassigned"
[22:26:31] <systemfault> Yes, "var" is dead.
[22:27:02] <mknod> Makes my eyes happier than const, but I'll get used to it eventually.
[22:27:33] <mknod> systemfault, can we agree that globable variables declared outside functions still need var?
[22:27:39] <systemfault> No.

[22:28:56] <systemfault> global immutable data is fine
[22:29:49] <mknod> They are mutable but in practice they are constant. For some reasons that are not relevant here, I declare them in the global scope _but_ assign them in a dedicated function, _globInit().
[22:30:11] <systemfault> mknod: And it's a "real" global?

[22:31:41] <systemfault> I did not know what you were working on.. so :P
[22:32:02] <systemfault> If you want a real global then you can be explicit: globalThis.foo = 10;
[22:32:06] <mknod> Yeah, my fault. :)
[22:32:39] <systemfault> n> globalThis.foo = 10; foo;
[22:32:41] <jellobot> (okay) 10

[22:33:21] <jellobot> (okay) 10
[22:33:31] <mknod> I like this.
[22:33:34] <systemfault> Moreover, it's a better practice than using "window" because globalThis is the global object no matter the environment
[22:34:03] <systemfault> (In the browser, globalThis points to "window", on NodeJS it will point to "global"
[22:34:47] <mknod> Can I batch assign to globalThis?

[23:54:29] <adsc> is there an elegant way to loop through objects and group them into nested arrays by value of a certain prop? I currently do it with an imperative style loop, but looking for a more functional way.

[23:58:21] <adsc> what I mean is transform this: [{name: "Bobby", group: 1}, {name: "Jimmy", group: 2}, {name: "Tommy", group: 1}] into this: [[{name: "Bobby", group: 1}, {name: "Tommy", group: 1}], [{name: "Jimmy", group: 2}]]
[23:58:46] <adsc> or a map would also work instead of a nested array
[23:59:20] <adsc> the grouping is the important part
