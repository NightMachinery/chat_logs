[18:57:04] <alzgh> I am going through a book and store my notes and exercises as a git repo, each chapter having their own folder, etc. Now, I'm at a chapter where we are going to build projects. Some of the projects are pre-made repos that I need to clone. Ideally, I would keep all the projects for the chapter under some directory in the folder belonging to this chapter. But since this is a mix of different git repos, I don't know what's best?
[18:57:28] <alzgh> What are my options? Pros and cons and best practice for such a situation?
[18:57:52] <alzgh> If there is a recommended read, I really appreciate that. Don't want to bother you guys too much with broad questions :D

[18:59:42] <OMGOMG_> alzgh: it depends. submodules, separate repo, or just copying the files into your repo are all viable
[18:59:42] <canton7> alzgh, submodules? https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules . Or just clone the repos and delete the .git dir, and track the contents directly as files in your repo, would be the most straightforward

[19:21:52] <woss> oh, that makes a lot of sense. because then i unpack the objects regardless of the difference the objects will always be the same
[19:22:10] <woss> let me put this in the context ...

[19:36:38] <woss> j416 maybe my question wasn't obvious. is there a way to get the cloned repo always the same? you said that git packs on clone, why then the pack changes when there is not new commit, or any change to the repo. why it is not deterministic
[19:36:59] <j416> what happens if you clone the same thing twice?
[19:37:15] <j416> is that what you did?
[19:37:58] <woss> yes
[19:38:00] <j416> I don't remember much about the pack file format, but it's quite thoroughly documented; check the docs in git.git
[19:38:11] <j416> perhaps that'll answer your question
[19:38:32] <j416> like, maybe there's a date or such in there causing it to have a different hash
[19:39:15] <woss> i thought the same, but that's not it. i noticed that switches from one to another, never more than 2
[19:39:16] <j416> use-case might be to aid repack, because wouldn't want to overwrite an existing pack before the new pack has been successfully stored

[20:45:05] <j416> ah, you want * instead of ? also
[20:45:22] <Baughn> I ran fsck on the repository, and that fixed it. Apparently info/refs was missing.
[20:45:25] <Baughn> No idea why.
[20:45:28] <j416> otherwise it won't catch multiple spaces
[20:45:34] <j416> but, perhaps a start.
[20:46:24] <j416> NoImNotNineVolt: so the last one I gave you above says, "a word is: maybe a space, followed by one or more non-space characters, maybe followed by a space"
[20:47:48] <j416> replacing ? with * makes it a bit more prone to capturing more than it's supposed to I think
[20:48:00] <j416> but should at least in the theory in my head be more "accurate"
[20:48:32] <j416> it would make it, "a word is: zero or more spaces, followed by one or more non-space characters, followed by zero or more spaces"
[20:48:43] <j416> that is, '[[:space:]]*[^[:space:]]+[[:space:]]*'

[20:59:27] <j416> but, it seems difficult to get it to do what you want, because you can only define what a word is, and if you say that spaces are (sometimes) part of words, then it'll treat words surrounded by spaces as just that, and the split on space doesn't really happen
[20:59:48] <NoImNotNineVolt> i think a regex of '.' is gonna be my best bet.
[21:00:01] <NoImNotNineVolt> it doesn't preserve any sort of word-based affinity, but that's fine.
[21:00:11] <j416> that'll give you a lot of tiny diffs, but it should be yes
[21:00:18] <NoImNotNineVolt> really, my goal is simply to give me readable diffs when super-long lines are edited.
[21:00:27] <NoImNotNineVolt> so, tiny diffs are good :P
[21:00:31] <j416> . says "each character is a word, so split after each character"
[21:01:33] <j416> NoImNotNineVolt: I quite like the diff-highlight contrib
[21:01:40] <NoImNotNineVolt> ideally i'd be able to write a regex that behaves like '.' in this context but gives me some slight preference for word boundaries...

[21:02:34] <NoImNotNineVolt> so that "foo bar" -> "foo baz bar" gives me "foo {+baz +}bar" rather than "foo ba{+z ba+}r", but that may be impossible.
