[00:26:06] <ciphrCat> “Dear The Honorable..” seems rather awkward.. i'm surprised the "The" is important
[00:28:46] <StayHungry> ciphrCat: not exactly that...
[00:33:34] <StayHungry> there is address where you mention 'the honorable' and salutation where you put either 'dear district attorney (surname)' e.g. https://rotattop.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rackauckas-T.-02-14-18.jpg or 'Dear Mr/Ms (surname)' e.g. https://i0.wp.com/thehawkseyeconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img_1318.jpg 
[00:40:40] <ciphrCat> wow that's confusing.  So the 2nd example shows the DA getting downgraded to "Mr."
[00:42:43] <ciphrCat> Mr. seems unsafe b/c of the off chance that they are also a PhD, so I'll just go with “Dear District Attorney Gonzales”

[01:14:37] <mdogg> Ok, I stand corrected.  However, going by https://www.formsofaddress.info/honorable/ - you will need to know if the person you are writing was elected or appointed.  Because if the attorney you are writing was appointed then they haven't earned the title of "honorable" I guess. 
[01:14:59] <ksft> only judges are typically addressed as "Your Honor", as far as I know, but there are a whole lot of people who get the style "The Honorable"
[01:15:22] <mdogg> ^ I'll go along with that.

[01:17:26] <mdogg> It may be appropriate - I just wouldn't do it unless they're a judge/Justice.  
[01:19:02] <mdogg> I also don't like to address people as "dear" in a salutation.  I'd rather say, "Senator Becky Lastname:" or "Governor Smith:"
[01:19:29] <mdogg> Mainly because I don't like people I don't know addressing me as 'dear'...

[03:21:03] <kurahaupo> ciphrCat: Prescriptivism for letter forms is very much a matter of culture. Personally I have little time for titles and boilerplate phrases that add no useful information, but there are occasions when I will acquiesce and add them because I know that they are important to the particular recipient.
[03:21:04] <kurahaupo> I would normally eschew "dear" and use "greetings", "hello", "hi, "g'day", "to" or nothing, depending on the formality. Sometimes I will be more creative.
[03:21:04] <kurahaupo> I will use full names in preference to titles, partly because there are conflicting standards on whether one should use "Mr" with the given name or surname or both, and partly because I dislike people addressing me with a title.
[03:21:04] <kurahaupo> I prefer to finish a letter with "thankyou for (something relevant)" and my name. "Faithfully" and "sincerely" are two of the most insincere unfaithful anachronisms that should have been consigned to history long ago. And many of the variations on "xxx regards" and not traditional but rather are modern portmanteaux, nonsence mash-ups like "best wishes" with "kind regards" to get "best regards".

[07:19:27] <StayHungry> He: Well, obviously they don't mean literally. The Irish were never Black. 
[07:19:39] <StayHungry> Me: why do you type Black with B? i'm aware of Black Panthers, but color names... 
[07:19:53] <StayHungry> He: Because times and norms have changed again, and now we say "Black" with a capital B, because that's what they want to be called, and I try to refer to people the way they want to be referred to.
[07:22:02] <StayHungry> Question: am i missed something, or the language changes that quickly now?

[18:40:10] <lpapp> hi, what sounds more natural, rotate handle or rotation handle?
[18:40:27] *** Quits: upupbb-user5 (~puppy@3EC97C6F.unconfigured.pool.telekom.hu) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:40:27] <lpapp> I am not a native speaker, but rotation handle sounds more natural to me to pronounce.
[18:40:43] <lpapp> e.g. in a 3D software where you rotate object by using a GUI handle.
[18:43:51] <huf> a widget?
[18:43:53] <huf> yeah rotation handle
[18:44:41] *** Quits: Aoyagi (~yags@user/aoyagi) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[18:44:53] <lpapp> a drawing, yeah.
[18:45:02] <lpapp> rotate would be better in the code for a method
[18:45:05] <lpapp> that rotates objects
[18:45:10] <lpapp> then it could be used as a verb
[18:45:20] <huf> you can label the widget "rotate" too
[18:45:21] <lpapp> but when describing a noun, rotation or translation handle flows better to me
[18:45:24] <huf> the zoom button is called "zoom"
[18:45:29] <lpapp> sure, but that refers to an action
[18:45:46] <huf> yeah but it depends, where will this name appear?
[18:45:51] <lpapp> a rotation handle can rotate, for sure.
[18:45:58] <lpapp> in the code
[18:46:04] <lpapp> drawRotationHandle vs. drawRotateHandle
[18:46:08] <huf> ah
[18:46:09] <lpapp> I personally like the former.
[18:46:11] <huf> yeah yeah
[18:46:16] <huf> you're naming the thing in code, sure.
[18:46:29] <lpapp> even if I speak about the handle
[18:46:32] <lpapp> I would say rotation handle
[18:46:39] <lpapp> but I may be wrong, as I am not a native speaker.
[18:46:43] <huf> thought for a sec you wanted to put this on the gui itself
[18:46:44] <huf> as a label
[18:46:47] <lpapp> I would say rotate when I describe the action by a verb what it does.
[18:47:06] <lpapp> rotate handle sounds odd to me
[18:47:14] <lpapp> a verb and a noun together to describe a noun
[18:48:07] <lpapp> this issue could be generalised
[18:48:15] <lpapp> "navigate button" vs. "navigation button"
[18:48:25] <huf> it's the second
[18:48:29] <lpapp> which one flows better and sounds more natural?
[18:48:31] <huf> and rotate handle dont sound so good.
[18:48:39] <huf> so go with rotation. and navigation.

[21:37:26] <kurahaupo> lpapp: I think I would prefer a different word from "handle", because "rotation handle" is a near miss for "rotating handle" (like a doorknob, which is not99,99 what you want). Perhaps "rotation control" or "angle control" or "orientation control".
[21:42:47] <huf> if the thing is already called a handle in the library, then call it a handle
[21:42:54] <huf> and yeah, what ksft said
[21:43:20] <huf> if it's just you inventing the word "handle", then pick another one maybe, as kurahaupo said :)
[21:44:19] <kurahaupo> Just because the library calls it a handle, that doesn't mean you need to use that term when describing it to the user
[21:44:31] <huf> no but this is about what to call it in code
[21:44:44] <huf> entirely different cake of a beast
[21:45:32] <huf> for users, you'd call it "rotate"

[23:05:53] <TechTest> I suggest you find out :P

[23:09:35] <TechTest> my cat for some reason licks my arms since I've shaved them
[23:10:11] <TechTest> does it mean my forearms are not clean anymore..?
[23:10:47] <lall-> Dunno. Dogs lick you because there's anti microbial shit in their saliva, so they actually trying to help you out. Not sure why cat would lick your arms though. Sounds weird.
[23:11:00] <MetaNova> cats (who are fond enough of their owners to lick them in the first place) like licking skin for the salt content (from sweat), being hairless makes this easier for them
[23:11:26] <lall-> cats don't sweat, like dogs, through skin.
[23:11:42] <MetaNova> dogs don't sweat through skin
[23:11:54] <MetaNova> that's why they pant
[23:11:58] <TechTest> MetaNova: are you saying my cat is trying to get some sodium from my forearms?
[23:12:11] <MetaNova> TechTest: you taste nice, they're sampling you
[23:12:22] <TimMc> Ot it likes the soap you use, something like that.
[23:12:36] <TimMc> *Or
[23:12:45] <TechTest> I guess they like shaved forearms
[23:12:59] <lall-> maybe it hasa fetish for your forearms.
[23:13:21] <TechTest> he didn't have it before
[23:19:41] <kurahaupo> salt in perspiration is probably what they like
[23:20:51] <StayHungry> something like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud-puddling
[23:20:52] <kurahaupo> Cats will groom each other's fur, but if your arms are shaved that won't be it
[23:25:26] <TechTest> he only does it now that my arms are shaved 
[23:26:29] <TechTest> he has always be licking my fingers when I was petting him or my face like kisses, but when he licks my forearms it's more like grooming than kissing :P
[23:27:19] <TechTest> my assumption is that shaved arms are not groomed anymore and need grooming
