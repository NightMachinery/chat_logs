[02:27:28] <GaurishSharma[m]> Hello All,
[02:27:28] <GaurishSharma[m]> I am trying to run Sidekiq, JRuby to fetch large results 30M rows from snowflake using JDBC driver. I was able to get connection to snowflake working in a script but when I do the same code in rails. it doesn't work. I think the driver is not being loaded correctly.

[02:30:06] <GaurishSharma[m]> I am sorry if this is not the right place to ask questions. I am trying to get people to use Jruby at my company
[03:17:58] <Freaky> any other differences in environment?
[03:46:13] <headius> Hello there!
[03:47:34] <headius> Yes that does look like it is not loading the correct driver. Do you have the jdbc-whatever gem and activerecord visited correctly for your database?

[05:21:46] <GaurishSharma[m]> I have this standalone script that works without any additional gems being installed https://gist.github.com/gaurish/8336972c32b8645a918b4f51b4bf1c08
[05:23:08] <GaurishSharma[m]> What is weird is that same script doesn't work inside sidekiq / rails -> https://gist.github.com/gaurish/6eec42d62ee40b15da105be8eda9a6fc
[18:43:14] <byteit101[m]> Should a java-usable classloader (a-la the jrubyfx one I recently made) be part of jruby proper?

[19:51:36] <byteit101[m]> The best way to find bugs is to write documentation. Found a bug in non-concrete reified classes
[20:15:20] <byteit101[m]> Aha! found the strange callstacks again
