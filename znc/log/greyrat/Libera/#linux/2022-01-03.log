[00:09:55] <ryu_> I am trying to understand LVM. Can you under creation of a volume group, set the size of the volume group? vgcreate VG_name /dev/sdb3 -s 8MiB  creates a volume group on the pv "/dev/sdb3" with PE of 8MiB. Now, let us say that the pv has a size of 80MiB. That would create ~10 usable blocks for the vg, and a total size of 80MiB for that volume group. How can I create a volume group with the size of 40MB? Or is this not a thing.
[00:10:01] <Blondie101010> tusko:  BCD was mostly only used on mainframes
[00:10:05] <Dagmar> No, but it is easy to think through since you're basically doing things exactly as you would on paper with a pencil

I right click on the USB device in dolphin and click "safely remove." When I plug the USB back in the file has only been half-cpied
[02:36:16] <kapaun> that's the problem
[02:36:17] <rascul> if it was in use still, then no tools i'm aware of will umount it without screaming
[02:36:18] <gjvc> thank you rascul
[02:36:40] <Dagmar> kapaun: So submit a bug report to Dolphin
[02:36:51] <jessicara> yeah that sounds like a bug that particular case
[02:36:53] <kapaun> hahaah funny joke
[02:37:01] <Dagmar> It should _not_ be claiming it's safe to remove flash media until the sync is done
[02:37:01] <movah4c_int21> on linux you should use some system monitor and watch if it's doing anything after you safly unmounted it
[02:37:02] <gjvc> if anything, Dolphin was lying about the safe to remove part, not the copying
[02:37:11] <kapaun> KDE never fixes bugs lol
[02:37:23] <Dagmar> They'll never fix it until someone reports it
[02:37:32] <rascul> did it say it was safe to remove after you clicked "safely remove" ?
[02:37:36] <kapaun> Yes
[02:37:53] <Dagmar> That would be a bug, and one that is likely fairly easy to reproducce
[02:38:02] <gjvc> obviously not true
[02:38:05] <kapaun> Actually I remember Linus Sebastion ran into that in his "doing basic things on Linux video"
[02:38:10] <kapaun> he copid like a 4gb video
[02:38:15] <jessicara> yeah reproduction... that is not easy
[02:38:19] <kapaun> and it was a blank screen
[02:38:21] <jessicara> i have copied 16gb files to usb
[02:38:22] <kapaun> when he opened it
[02:38:26] <Dagmar> Nah, slow-ass flash media is EASY to get your hands on
[02:38:29] <jessicara> with dolphin too several times, it worked
[02:38:35] <gjvc> also, i'm not sure how dolphin would know that all buffers have been synced (apart from calling sync() itself)

[02:39:06] <gjvc> so i'm guessing it never did
[02:39:11] <Dagmar> Telling the user it's safe to rip the card from the socket would be wrong
[02:39:17] <jessicara> but there is one difference i'm aware of, i do away and leave the machine idle for hours, probably hours more than it needs to finish sync completely on it's own

[05:51:29] <eof> i think when companies like uber talk about AI for matching passengers with drivers they tend to refer to the training and the rest as a complete package

[07:23:33] <Gaboradon> phogg, rbox; For a long time I was thinking of a OS that lest the admin really control it properly, but I don't have detailed ideas yet, however one thing I did thought up now is there could be a fundamental and core system that would basically be defacto requirement with the whole OS built around it, and that is that the commands, actions, activities coming from an actual HW input would be the highest level of privileges or second
[07:23:35] <Gaboradon> highest, that means all my mouse clicks and keyboard taps no matter what command line or GUI, it would always be able to do almost anything, security would be achived by simply figurout out the way to make it secure. I would literally pay someone to create an OS like this today if I had the money.
[07:23:48] <labrador> yeah?
[07:24:00] <ayecee> labrador: you don't have that locale installed

[07:24:48] <Bocaneri> Gaboradon, I think maybe you need to review your concept of "security".

[07:24:55] <labrador> How do you install locales ayecee ?
[07:25:01] <phogg> Gaboradon: "a fundamental and core system that ... [is] a requirement with the whole [system] built around it" is essentially the definition of "operating system"
[07:25:01] *** Joins: sheepduck (~sheepduck@user/sheepduck)
[07:25:06] <Gaboradon> Basically some kind of a real-deal HW terminal thing,  where the OS reconginizes "okay this is coming from real phyiscal person admin who has Terminal access for this desktop PC" ... security done in a different way by you physically securing the PC to prevent physical access to the device.

[07:26:32] <ayecee> felco: what
[07:26:43] <phogg> Gaboradon: most of the time you operate in software at a very high level of abstraction around hardware. Making it impossible to emulate that abstraction could prove quite detrimental to utility.

[07:34:49] <Gaboradon> Bocaneri: Why so, wouldn't it focus the security on 2 things, one of which is outside programming so it's of no worry to software devs, and the other half would focus the security on the authentication of the Terminal <-> Computer and then nobody, apps, DE's, wouldn't sort of need to worry about it, but I didn't thought down that deep yet, they'll certainly have to all support this and be aware, recognizing commands from Real-Terminal
[07:34:50] <Gaboradon> (source: physically present computer operator, sysadmin) and running those with higher privileges than other stuff done programmatically, then there's the question when a sysadmin runs a script and the commands come from a scheduled task ...

[09:14:51] <ayecee> programmar: some people modify the default value in /proc/sys/vm/swappiness, thinking they'll improve performance, and usually don't.
[09:15:15] <ayecee> programmar: high load as in load average, as seen in top and /proc/loadavg

[09:23:21] <rascul> he's kind of authoritative
[09:23:22] <ayecee> you've increased the amount of unused anonymous memory and the amount of vfs memory used, what gets removed?
[09:23:56] <gothicserpent> ayecee: It was 100. This setting affects the storage of special filesystem metadata entries. Constantly reading and refreshing this information is generally very costly, so storing it on the cache for longer is excellent for your system’s performance. As it is currently configured, the system removes inode information from the cache far too quickly. So, I set this to a more conservative setting,
[09:23:58] <gothicserpent> like 50, by using sysctl

[09:32:58] <gothicserpent> debian defaults are 60, and if i do that, the swap file grows a bit large for my liking ( as i said before )
[09:33:02] <yBtNJW3j> Swapping is a technique where data in Random Access Memory (RAM) is written to a special location on your hard disk—either a swap partition or a swap file—to free up RAM.--howtogeek.com  Writing to harddisks is bad (or other permanent drives).  If it runs out of ram to run the software, and then needs ram to load to disks, it could be slower or fall behind.  The worse part is that writing to those kinds of disks causes a lot of wear, so it should
[09:33:02] <yBtNJW3j>  be minimized if possible in my opinion.

[10:13:01] <gothicserpent> "While it is not recommended, it doesn't mean that you cannot run it in that way. When you said that you created swap that was 16Gib, I thought you were stating that you were going to be running a lot of RAM-intensive applications that were going to be regularly using much of that RAM. If you are just using it as "bust" so that your Droplet doesn't run out of usable RAM, then you can leave it like
[10:13:03] <gothicserpent> that."

[10:14:17] <gothicserpent> MockingMoniker: just trying to get the proper settings for my partitions.
[10:14:22] <rascul> seems unlikely you need anywhere near that much swap
[10:14:23] <ayecee> a 1gb droplet with a 16gb swap would be in pretty sorry shape before it used much of that swap.
[10:14:31] <MockingMoniker> gothicserpent, perhaps you can get several smaller VMs and put each app on one VM.
[10:15:04] <gothicserpent> MockingMoniker: tried it, it's more expensive
[10:15:24] <gothicserpent> i bought one new vm with a premium amd cpu and it works well, cpu util only around 3% avg
[10:15:27] <MockingMoniker> gothicserpent, so, you're trying to do this in the most cost-effectie way?
[10:15:35] <gothicserpent> rascul, ayecee i might lower the swapfile size from 16G.
[10:15:54] <MockingMoniker> gothicserpent, find the app that's consuming your ram and put it on a separate VM that's configured for this.

[10:35:25] <mikebutash> my only complaint with arch is every time I need to install something, it wants me to upgrade the os
[10:35:32] <MockingMoniker> The kernel points to gcc which automatically builds init and the runs it, which in turn calls GCC again to build the next program and then runs it, while it also starts buildling the next one an so on.
[10:36:00] <mikebutash> the arch people just yell at me and tell me to upgrade more regularly anyways
[10:36:31] <MockingMoniker> Maybe hack GCC so it adds to itself as it runs, and sort of makes a VM.
[10:37:34] <gothicserpent> vanessa: i think they will know in #ffmpeg basically if you set the framerate low enough you can have something similar to what you want. it must be a whole integer. OBS is another option but it's bloated compared to ffmpegs incredible streamline.

[11:12:25] <Henry151> i'm confused and maybe someone can help me figure it out
[11:12:30] <vanessa> on your idle prompt, Ctrl+D will send EOF which quits the terminal. If not on prompt, close the running application first, Ctrl+C, Intelo
[11:12:46] <Henry151> i made a backup of my media server using backblaze, right before a big harddrive failure
[11:12:55] <Feriun> Hey there, Anyone who's able to help me out with something!
[11:12:59] <Henry151> now i'm trying to restore things, now that i've replaced the harddrive
[11:13:01] <rouji> EOF closing your shell or not depends on the shell (or its config)
[11:13:15] <Henry151> i can't remember anything so that's making everything really difficult
[11:14:12] <vanessa> rouji, a lot of it depends on the terminal emulator. on what terminal emulator does EOF not quit it?
[11:14:15] <Henry151> so i'm peeking around at it and i've got thing set up so that for example i can run `rclone lsf bblaze:` and it lists my three buckets, edge-backup, lenovop51-backup, and henry151-backup
[11:14:33] <Feriun> It takes a couple of minutes after typing the credentials on the login page and entering gnome (During this time my display goes blank) on every boot. WHY? How can I see what's going wrong?
[11:15:00] <Henry151> so if i look in edge-backup with command `rclone lsf bblaze:edge-backup` it gives me just a single directory, `henry` .. i would expect it to give me a bunch of directories

[21:50:19] <hexnewbie> KDE did use to have such feature in the past, but I quickly turned it off when it resized some of windows without consent :)
[21:50:24] <bullgard4> bob_x2, And now please google for the string " No working leases in persistent database - sleeping."
[21:50:25] <soren_> you can just shrink the hexchat window to that part you want visible your firefox window can take up the remaining space. At any point if you need to just focus the hexchat window, press a binding, and it will be fullscreen. The workflow is very fluid and tiling wm makes the most efficient use of scren real estate. Workspaces are of course integral to that

[22:06:25] <akk> I don't understand the point -- do the developers think that people's window managers (or OSes for win/mac people) don't work right? And if so, does CSD offer anything the typical os/wm doesn't?
[22:06:33] <Whatshisface> so, it has been a while since i dug in to FreeBSD. But I read an interesting argument the other night that FreeBSD has "substantially lower network latency" than Linux. Personally, I tweak the hell out of my network stacks... I manually adjust my IRQ affinity explicitly for the chip(s) and placement of the nic's, i tweak my interrupt moderation dependent upon my workload as well as the netdev budget and weight, modify the backlog set
[22:06:44] <mrfb> easy to say, did you check the roadmap and issue list? The amount of work they have ahead is a lot, I admire them
[22:06:59] <Whatshisface> From what I can tell, while FreeBSD may have lower network latency out of the box? The Linux stack is infinitely more tuneable and more capable with the right tweaks..

[23:27:50] <Jimmy2027> yeah on macbookpf I can simply connect with "ssh ethsec"

[23:47:49] <Henry151> that sounds like the correct solution
[23:47:58] <rbox> yeah, of course its going to work then
[23:48:01] <rbox> you're not doing a double jump
[23:48:02] <Henry151> but i'm not sure how i am supposed to correctly configure the dns records
