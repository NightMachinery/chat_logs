[00:12:25] <drobi> cherim: I think the algebra would get in the way.. h1, h2 are hyperbolas and l is a limacon. They're not all axis aligned, so there's a bunch of complicated terms. The important thing is that it's easy to express the intersection polynomials as ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0. Not so easy to express as polynomials of a, or b without squaring a whole bunch of nasty algebra.

[01:53:38] <qergle> it seems like a bet where you win with 2/3 prob, lose with 1/6 prob, and draw with 1/6 prob
[01:53:50] <hugh_marera> you have {win, draw, lose} so for a fair you expect 1/3 probability for each outcome
[01:54:11] <qergle> if you win, you win €1, if you lose you lose €2, and draw is net 0.
[01:54:55] <qergle> so the expected winnings is (2/3)*1 + (1/6)*(-2) + (1/6)*0 = 1/3

[03:24:42] <Z-module> It's kind of neat what stuff is generally true even for those. I found this one quite striking:  If A is any abelian group *at all*, then it has an omega-chain of subgroups  A_1 <= A_2 <= A_3 <= ...    (not strict inclusion) whose union is all of A, and each A_n is a direct sum of cyclic groups.
[03:25:57] <Z-module> (I guess you can/should get rid of the equality steps in that chain, and just say it's a finite chain or an omega-chain)
[03:27:10] <cherim> I have an opposite obstacle to enjoying this -- come on, it's abelian, everything is very simple on finite subgroups or when adding one element; then Zorn does so much for free
[03:27:19] <Z-module> often, yes
[03:27:43] <Z-module> but then weird stuff does also happen, like the full direct product Z^omega not being free.
[03:28:49] <cherim> After I do finite group theory (like Isaacs) for 4-5 months, I become afraid even of Z for some time
[03:29:13] <cherim> It's infinite and I just had so much trouble with finite ones

[07:22:38] <LTCD>  but now I understand my picture is saying the same thing.
[07:23:13] <qergle> mutual independence is stronger.

My random variable was defined to have 4 possible outcomes (that I labeled a,x,y,z) each of the same probability (that's what a "uniform" random variable is, in the finitary case like this), so Pr(a) = Pr(x) = Pr(y) = Pr(z) = 1/4.

[17:31:58] <Koen__> hi, Imk0tter
[17:32:48] <Koen__> the difference between (2*16*256*65536) and (1*15*255*65535) is (2*16*256*65536) - (1*15*255*65535)
[17:32:58] <Koen__> also notice that 65536 = 65535 + 1
[17:33:09] <Koen__> and 256 = 255 + 1
[17:33:10] <Koen__> etc
[17:33:36] <Koen__> also, a good thing to do when starting on a math problem, is to give names to things
[17:33:40] <Koen__> let's call d the difference
[17:33:46] <Koen__> d = (2*16*256*65536) - (1*15*255*65535)
[17:34:40] <Koen__> then you can replace 65536 by 65535+1, and see where that gets you

[18:53:56] <mawk> "passiflore" = passion flower
[18:53:59] <Z-module> yes

[19:13:58] <aac> greetings. I have a simple question, if i have a dividend of 59 and a divisor of 4, how do i know if its divisilbe?
[19:15:14] <riv> what is the motivation for rewriting int[0,inf] x/(e^x - 1) dx as
[19:15:36] <Z-module> aac, the question is:  Is 59 = 4*k  for some integer k ?   Can you see the answer?
[19:15:46] <riv> int[0,inf] x (e^(-x) - 1)/(1 - e^(-x)) + x 1/(1 - e^(-x)) dx
[19:15:59] <aac> im asking this because, i learned a method on school to divide, that i don't seem to find on the web . The method is put dividend on the left , create a semi cross on the right, and put the diviisor on the right. Now i put number on the righst side, and keep subtracting...
[19:16:01] <riv> i get using the e^(-x) so you have a convergent geometric series
[19:16:06] <riv> but why split it into two?
[19:16:28] <aac> Z-module, not really no...but could be a complex subject
[19:16:33] <riv> is there something particularly nice about x (e^(-x) - 1)/(1 - e^(-x)) that I do not see?
[19:16:56] <Z-module> aac, the positive integer multiples of 4 are  4, 8, 12, 16, 20, ....
[19:17:05] <aac> i see...
[19:17:06] <Z-module> Clearly 59 is not one of those.
[19:17:13] <Z-module> all multiples of 4 are even

[19:18:12] <aac> Z-module, how many dividing algorithm exists?  i think that the method inve learned is old..
[19:18:35] <int-e> riv: sorry, I mean (e^(-x) - 1)/(1 - e^(-x)) is -1. I mixxed the leading x factor
[19:18:42] <riv> O_O
[19:19:03] <riv> ok
[19:19:11] <riv> so this was a strange manipulation
[19:19:30] <riv> int[0,inf] x/(e^x - 1) dx = int[0,inf] x e^(-x)/(1 - e^(-x)) dx
[19:19:32] <riv> that makes sense
[19:19:57] <riv> oh ok so its just the first term of the geometric series
[19:20:04] <riv> the way it was presented was very odd
[19:20:22] <int-e> riv: that's fine, and e^-x looks like the derivative of 1 - e^(-x), so that's a setup for integration by parts if you want it to be
[19:20:39] <riv> 1/(1 - a) = 1 + a + a^2 + ..,  a/(1 - a) = a + a^2 + ..,  so a/(1 - a) = 1/(1 - a) - 1

[19:29:05] <riv> yeah
[19:29:11] <Z-module> Hmm, not sure if this is that pretty, but kind of neat.  Let A be an m x n matrix, and B be n x m, and let X denote the indeterminate used in our characteristic polyinomials.  Then:   X^n charpoly(AB) = X^m charpoly(BA)
[19:29:25] <riv> you could even work out an expression for the 11th roots of unity, but it invovles 5th roots
[19:29:25] <pikapika> because its a symmetric 6th order equation which means its a quadratic of a cubic

[19:44:12] <Z-module> (I hadn't noticed that A_5 has this property.)

[20:01:37] <aac> is 17, the divisor?
[20:01:44] <aac> i learned that the divisor was right
[20:01:44] <buster> yes
[20:01:54] <int-e> For example, in char. 2, a = b = 0 implies ab = 0, while a = b = 1 implies ab = 1, but we have a^n + b^n = 0 for all n in both cases. So reconstrcuting ab isn't possible.
[20:01:55] <aac> nm
[20:03:36] <aac> well..in my version of division, the partials, are the numbers that are getting subtracted to the dividen
[20:03:57] <aac> kind of like a quotient steps
[20:04:08] <aac> ah isee you pout the quutiente at top
[20:04:25] <riv> I just realized
[20:04:31] <riv> you can show that an integral is bounded <= some value
[20:04:38] <riv> but that doesn't imply convergence
[20:04:41] <riv> it might oscillate
[20:05:27] <buster> 85 and 136 then? if i was ever told a name for them i don't remember it now

[20:52:22] <pikapika> boris77, hi
[20:52:30] <riv> you just need to study modular arithmetic a bit
[20:52:36] <riv> then the guassian periods make sense

[20:53:06] <riv> its not too diffcult - but of course coming up with it in the first place was genius

[21:08:55] <riv> 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 4+2=1, 4+3=2

[21:11:11] <pikapika> so the squares that divide the n are the way to find these powers?
[21:11:35] <pikapika> how was the second order subgrouping done ie dividing each of these sums into two further halves?
[21:12:45] <riv> so mod p you have a multiplticative group, and the squares form a subgroup of that
[21:13:08] <pikapika> oh
[21:13:23] <pikapika> and these two subgroups that formed, they can be further divided into subgroups potentially?
[21:13:25] <riv> and what we can do is make A the gaussian period from summing the orbit of z under the action of that group
[21:13:35] <riv> and then B, C, etc. from the cosets of that group
[21:14:02] <riv> squares and nonsquares always split the group into 2. but you could pick a different group and split the roots into 3 sets
[21:14:09] <pikapika> I'll have to reread what orbit was
[21:14:34] <pikapika> What I remember of 17th root was that it neatly divided like a binary tree
[21:14:36] <riv> the group is {1,2,4} so the sum of the orbit is z^1 + z^2 + z^4
[21:14:46] <int-e> But indeed, quadratic residues look more promising. y = x^16 + x^15 + x^13 + x^9 + x^8 + x^4 + x^2 + x is a root of y^2 + y - 4. Fun!

[21:15:01] <int-e> (For a root x of x^16 + x^15 + ... + 1)
[21:15:23] <riv> so its a case where you just nest quadratics, but 7-1 = 2*3  is a case where you have a division into 3 periods
[21:15:43] <riv> what you can do is pick a primitive root mod p, that generates all indices -and cube it
[21:16:24] <riv> for example 3^i mod 7 gives (for i=1,2,3,..)  3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1
[21:16:45] <riv> so we can pick gauss periods A = z^3 + z^4,  B = z^2 + z^5,  C = z^6 + z^1
[21:17:25] <riv> then A + B + C  = -1, A B C = 1

[21:18:10] <pikapika> 17=1,2,4,8,9,13,15,16 apparently
[21:18:22] <pikapika> so the difficulty is in computing these residues first
[21:18:52] <riv> which is saying that A,B,C are roots of the polynomial x^3 - x^2 - 2 * x + 1
[21:19:56] <int-e> though hmm, that leaves us with having to solve x^16 + x^15 + x^13 + x^9 + x^8 + x^4 + x^2 + x = (-1 +/- sqrt(17))/2, eww.
[21:20:36] <pikapika> int-e, apparently if we continue the subdivisions, this equation will just reduce to another quadratic of a quadratic

[22:47:55] <Z-module> And in that case, f would actually have to map Q onto either Q or onto Q\{q} for some single rational q, but also f would assume all but at most one rational value countably infinitely often.
[22:48:22] <kobalt> I am calculating as follow: first I select 2 students out of 4 in 4C2 ways, then I am finding number of surjective functions from the set of prizes to this set of 2 students, which is (2^10 -2C1). So total numer of ways is 4C2*(2^10-2C1) = 6132. You are probably using the Stirling's formula?
[22:48:27] <kobalt> qergle: ^
[22:49:50] <qergle> yeah i did C(4,2)*S(10,2)
[22:50:21] <kobalt> qergle: I have not learned how to calculate Stirling numbers yet.

[22:53:04] <kobalt> I meant, I don't yet understand it's concept.
[22:58:07] <sss> int-e, i'll kill you=)
[22:58:57] <kobalt> qergle: the answer to the second part is 6148?
[22:59:06] <qergle> kobalt: no
[22:59:23] <qergle> forget the numbers a second. can you have 4 kids getting zero prizes?
[22:59:24] <Z-module> oh, hmmm, I think the f I mentioned there will be bijective from A -> B actually, but (as any transc. entire function must) it will map countably infinitely many nonreal z onto each q in B (with maybe one exception).  So I think the  f(z) in B  iff  z in A    property there is just for real z.
[23:00:36] <kobalt> I think no.
[23:01:05] <qergle> it's no, you have to distribute the 10 prizes somewhere, and you can't if they all get 0.
[23:01:28] <qergle> so ≥2 means exactly 2 + exactly 3
[23:01:34] <kobalt> yes.
[23:01:46] <qergle> and how must the distribution be when 3 get 0?
[23:02:01] <kobalt> exaclty 1

[23:09:30] <qergle> kobalt: am i misremembering your post, wasn't part b ≥ 2?
[23:10:30] <kobalt> 2nd part was "at least two student gets nothing".
[23:10:49] <qergle> so why are you asking about ≤2?
[23:10:57] <qergle> curiosity?
[23:15:32] <kobalt> sorry I was mixed up. I was thinking in term of number of ways ≤ 2 kids gets prizes.
[23:17:50] <kobalt> I am thinking this way: (1) give all prizes to exactly 1 kid so 3 kids gets nothing; (2) give all prizes to exactly 2 kids so remaining 2 kids gets nothing. (1)+(2) => 2 or more kids don't get any prize.

[23:18:17] <qergle> you already solved exactly 2 (6132)
[23:18:23] <qergle> now you need to count exactly 3
[23:18:54] <qergle> and we did the thought experiment on what exactly 3 means, so the count should be quite quick and mental.
[23:22:23] <cherim> int-e: B_z thing appears when one attempts to write down the "by continuity" argument: make B invertible with infinitesimal +zI, conjugate, clear denominator, take the limit

[23:26:16] <qergle> yes
[23:26:40] <cherim> I thought this (pretty difficult) text is completely out of fashion and I'll have the secret knowledge all for myself

[23:27:01] <qergle> and now i forced you to reveal it
[23:27:05] <kobalt> yay. I keep doing silly mistakes tho
[23:30:22] <qergle> is the permutation of items in their title the same book, just different edition?
[23:32:00] <cherim> https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/designs-graphs-codes-and-their-links/BFD0E21CCFDB17EC1D0FE4A1DFE789AA is the correct book
[23:32:31] <cherim> There was also a significantly smaller first edition which has no benefits over this one

[23:33:05] <cherim> And some other elementary combinatorics book by the same authors which people sometimes mix with it
[23:33:28] <qergle> there's an elementary combinatorics book by van lint and wilson, i don't think with cameron.
[23:33:50] <cherim> Yes, yours is the (obsolete) first edition

[23:44:52] <cherim> It becomes readable if you do http://apachepersonal.miun.se/~tomnil/designs/designsShortC.pdf as a prerequisite
