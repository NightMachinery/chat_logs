[03:21:32] <MetaNova> np
[03:22:02] <MetaNova> good time to configure SASL
[03:32:19] <troyt> Anybody have knowledge about debugging SASL EXTERNAL logins (using a certificate)?  I have my ZNC set up so the user has a single cert (for all networks). The cert expires in 2031, so I'm pretty sure it's good.  It used to work on every network that supported it.  I believe the ZNC system was restarted, but for most networks SASL EXTERNAL is not working anymore. Libera.chat handles it fine, though!
[03:33:21] <MetaNova> did you recently regenerate it?
[03:33:47] <DarthGandalf> audiodef: how did you discover the freenode channel, btw? is there some outdated documentation somewhere?
[03:33:47] <troyt> No. I did, however, jump into the .znc/user/<name>/cert folder and verify its fingerprint matches.
[03:34:17] <MetaNova> well
[03:34:27] <MetaNova> different networks use different fingerprints
[03:34:36] <troyt> I've tried removing and re-adding the fingerprint with the various network's nickservs (using a supported hash algo)
[03:35:07] <troyt> I'm just wondering is there anything additional as far as verbosity goes.  I did '/msg sasl verbose true', but that doesn't really say much.
[03:35:12] <MetaNova> make sure cert isn't loaded for the networks where it's not working
[03:35:22] <MetaNova> just for your user
[03:35:44] <MetaNova> otherwise, znc -D if you want verbosity
[03:35:45] <troyt> Good thought, would that be in the SASL configuration for the node, or am I just delving into the .znc/users/* 
[03:36:00] <troyt> I can give `znc -D` a try.
[03:36:06] <MetaNova> troyt: /msg *status unloadmod --type=network cert
[03:36:10] <MetaNova> (on each network)
[03:36:27] <troyt> OK.  Will try.
[03:36:34] <audiodef> DarthGandalf: No, I had an ident issue on Libera and went "eff it, I'm gonna see if it's on freenode." And then I resolve my ident issue. :)
[03:37:44] <troyt> MetaNova: it's not loaded in any network ("Module [cert] not loaded.")
[03:37:54] <troyt> So, please excuse me while I leave to run "znc -D"

[03:40:02] <gothkat> How is the -D troyt?
[03:41:45] <troyt> Chatty, but... 
[03:41:47] <troyt> I get a list of available SASL mechanism, then "SASL authentication failed
[03:41:52] <troyt> So not that much more information.
[03:42:04] <troyt> Although OFTC finally accepted the SASL...
[03:53:04] <Netboy3> oftc do not do SASL
[03:54:04] <Netboy3> you either nickserv identify or CertFP with them
[03:54:37] <Netboy3> they are moving to solanum which is finally going to honor SASL
[03:56:46] <troyt> I am somewhat confused with OFTC, then:  "[17:25:18] -NickServ- You are connected using SSL and have provided a matching client certificate"
[03:57:00] <troyt> But I don't think I have anything except sasl enabled (ie. no cert module)
[03:57:48] <troyt> <*status> Module [cert] not loaded.
[03:58:11] <troyt> So clearly there's something I don't undestand happening.
[03:58:12] <MetaNova> /znc listmods
[03:58:25] <Netboy3> that's CertFP, provided through the cert module which you need to load for CertFP to work
[03:58:47] <Netboy3> for oftc, do not even enable the sasl module
[03:58:56] <Netboy3> or it will fail
[03:59:12] <troyt> https://pastebin.com/bwe18wnK
[03:59:34] <MetaNova> cert is loaded for your user
[03:59:45] <troyt> I see the cert module.  As a global, but not a network level.
[03:59:49] <MetaNova> which means all networks are offered the cert it manages
[04:00:00] <troyt> OK, and that may be why other networks are failing with SASL?
[04:00:31] <Netboy3> are you using the same cert for all networks?
[04:00:38] <MetaNova> not sure why SASL auth is failing for you on those networks, but if you have cert loaded for your user, each network is going to get offered the same cert
[04:00:41] <troyt> Don't see a reason why not.
[04:00:46] <troyt> I am using the same cert for all.
[04:01:03] <troyt> .znc/users/troyt/moddata/cert/user.pem
[04:01:13] <MetaNova> which means each network will need the same corresponding fingerprint(s) for SASL EXTERNAL to succeed
[04:01:28] <Netboy3> (except oftc)
[04:01:45] <MetaNova> if the fingerprint isn't on file then EXTERNAL will fail, if no password is specified, then PLAIN will also fail, and on OFTC *sasl shouldn't even be loaded
[04:01:52] <troyt> Sure...so I ran openssl x509 -sha512 -noout -fingerprint -in user.pem | sed -e 's/^.*=//;s/://g;y/ABCDEF/abcdef/' to get the fingerprint, and that's what I used for everything
[04:02:05] <troyt> ie. /msg NickServ cert add <fingerprint>
[04:02:23] <MetaNova> well if you want it to work the same on other networks, like freenode, then the SHA-512 fingerprint will not work
[04:02:27] <troyt> I'm aware that some networks don't do sha512; so I've done the same for sha2556
[04:02:32] <MetaNova> freenode (and other networks) want SHA-1
[04:02:57] <troyt> Eww.
[04:02:59] <troyt> sha1?
[04:03:16] <MetaNova> yeah, go ahead and /ns cert add (no fingerprint argument) and you'll see
[04:03:24] <MetaNova> [on freenode]
[04:05:43] <troyt> I swear there was a warning message earlier (about an incompatible shasum) for each network -- and I used the right fingerprint.  Seems I was mistaken.  Anyway, mystery solved.  Thanks!
[04:05:56] <MetaNova> no problem
[04:06:56] <MetaNova> perhaps I should update the wiki, again, to indicate that freenode needs the fingerprint from the SHA-1 example

[15:21:16] <lyndog> Hey I am just getting to grips with ZNC and am wondering about using a reverse proxy like nginx. Looking at https://wiki.znc.in/Reverse_Proxy#IRC it isn't obvious to me if I'd need to disable the SSL option in ZNC when using nginx as a reverse proxy for IRC and rely on nginx or not. Is that a sensible assumption or would I be better passing through the traffic directly to ZNC and using it's already
[15:21:18] <lyndog> generated certificate?
[15:22:17] <Artea> letsencrypt + certbot
[15:22:37] <Artea> search for that and you will get a ok about SSL on ZNC
[15:23:08] <lyndog> Right, so disable the SSL on ZNC itself and use nginx with certbot?
[15:23:15] <Artea> no
[15:23:29] <Artea> that wouldn't work and is a terrible idea
[15:23:43] <Artea> use certbot to create ZNC SSL....
[15:32:08] *** Joins: Strom (strom@fedora/strom)
[15:33:19] <DarthGandalf> Artea: why it wouldn't, and why terrible?
[15:37:29] <lyndog> So I am getting this straight in my head, I'd need to generate a certificate with certbot manually, that's fine and easy enough. Then set ZNC to use that cert as well as the SSL options in nginx to use the same certificate files. A shame it can't all be done in nginx since certbot has a plugin for it that sets up all the renewals.
[15:38:21] <mgedmin> why do you say that it can't all be done in nginx?
[15:40:24] <mgedmin> it's my understanding that the setup shown in https://wiki.znc.in/Reverse_Proxy#IRC does ssl termination in nginx with plaintext streams going to znc via loopback
[15:40:25] <lyndog> I can always try to do it just with nginx and see how well it works. To be fair I was going to do it in stages anyway; first move webadmin over to a subdomain with letsencrypt certificate (since connecting to a non standard port with SSL is now a faff in many web browsers)
[15:40:41] <lyndog> mgedmin: that's what I thought
[15:40:57] <lyndog> I'll give it a shot when I finish some work :)

[16:37:03] <Artea> there is a few ways
[16:37:15] <Artea> there isn't exactly one only way to do stuff
[16:37:33] <Artea> what I tried to say is that before move to nginx which is a httpd
[16:37:54] <Artea> try first setup ZNC SSL using certbot / letsencrypt
[16:38:13] <Artea> using nginx as a base for ZNC SSL isn't a very good idea
[16:38:29] <Artea> only creates more troubles than benefits
[16:38:37] <Artea> more ways to be exploit and hacked
[16:38:54] <Artea> do everything internally on ZNC
[16:39:09] <Artea> as no dependent of outside services to work
[16:39:56] <Artea> only after all that is done, then think about use services that you wish like nginx, perl, python, tcl and mysql
[16:40:09] <Artea> this isn't documented stuff
[16:40:16] <Artea> there is no real guide about it
[16:41:29] <Artea> since is alot of work, alot of things envolved and for free, I doubt anyone will do all the work of create the perfect guide so others can take it and get money for your hard work...

[18:54:46] <Artea> noooo, is ignoring everything and trashing the only person that have nick registered since 1999
[18:54:59] <Artea> really, pissed me very off
[18:55:28] <Artea> how PTnet became... was a good network, but over time has become toxic, alot of traffic of influence and power

[19:31:38] <Artea> yeah, just google it
[19:31:49] <Artea> but isn't that bad, in my perpective
[19:32:04] <Artea> there is alot of words that I see that makes me wanna correct them
[19:32:22] <Artea> and most are from America, which makes it more impressive
[19:33:25] * DarthGandalf tries to imagine the alot made of words
[19:33:40] <Artea> is big, trust me
[19:33:55] <Artea> and funny thing is, alot of people says that my English isn't that bad
[19:34:30] <Artea> I'm Portuguese and 96% of my English comes from... the Teacher, Mr. Bill Gates
[19:34:59] <Artea> so I think Im fine with English Language :)
[19:35:32] <DarthGandalf> you would be alot better with it if you start using a lot though :)
[19:36:31] <Artea> is something to consider
[19:36:37] <DarthGandalf> regardless of level, there's always a room to improve
[19:37:00] <Artea> but Im a fast typer, don't need to look at keys to text... actually I made a few tests that I made 4 lines of text
[19:37:22] <Artea> and only made less than 10 mistyped words
[19:37:37] <Artea> with my eyes looking to other way
[19:37:51] <DarthGandalf> 10 mistyped words is a lot for 4 lines of text
[19:37:57] <Artea> well
[19:38:00] <Artea> do it then
[19:38:12] <DarthGandalf> I don't look at keyboard either
[19:38:19] <Artea> look at top of where you at now
[19:38:36] <Artea> type 4 lines with 1 of them be a 2 line text
[19:38:45] <Artea> and show to me
[19:38:45] <Khaytsus> So I guess no help with who the spammer that harrases #hamradio is then
[19:38:50] <Artea> I wanna compare
[19:39:12] <Artea> Khaytsus: wanna know my opinion on that ?
[19:39:30] <Khaytsus> Yes, I and others in the channel are curious who has been harasssing the channel for years
[19:39:32] <Artea> the trolls of EFnet is using the Libera.Chat channel as goat to spam
[19:39:53] <Khaytsus> But why #hamradio   and ##hamradio before that.  It seems too intentional.  Too targeted.
[19:39:55] <Artea> they maybe are not even here
[19:39:58] <Khaytsus> Too niche a channel to be random
[19:40:06] <Artea> yeah
[19:40:10] <Artea> is a pretext to spam
[19:40:15] <Artea> and flame Libera
[19:40:16] <Khaytsus> It can't be random; it's somsone targeting the channel
[19:40:22] <Khaytsus> And of course I realize it's spam
[19:40:32] <Khaytsus> But it's still targeted at the specific channel for some reason
[19:40:49] <Artea> the troll that harasses PTnet
[19:40:51] <DarthGandalf> I don't even know what that channel is...
[19:40:52] <Khaytsus> Someone is intentionally joe-jobbing the channel
[19:40:54] <DarthGandalf> radio for hamsters?
[19:41:08] <Artea> I don't think he ever put his foot here
[19:41:29] <Artea> and he is spamming the living hell the network
[19:41:42] <Artea> he is a simp of the cyber-terrorist group
[19:42:09] <Artea> all I know
[19:42:10] <Khaytsus> I just don't get any that channel.  I've seen #libera as a channel in the spam too but _tons_ of it with #hamradio in it.  It just seems like whoever is driving the spam has some vendetta against the channel
[19:42:23] <Artea> is I got the tip the who is behind the group is a dangerous person
[19:42:27] <Khaytsus> Don't get why that channel, that is
[19:42:46] <Artea> can be or not
[19:42:52] <Artea> at first
[19:43:20] <Artea> the spam was more for "channel moved from freenode to libera"
[19:43:27] <Khaytsus> Oh no, this has gone on for _years_
[19:43:44] <Artea> so the targetting hamradio
[19:43:47] <Artea> is just a pretext
[19:44:04] <Artea> can be targetting who owns / mods of channel
[19:44:26] <Artea> or just simple picked name to add to spam
[19:44:46] <Artea> it could be any channel of here
[19:45:04] <Artea> the fact is, the true message is that is targetting Libera
[19:45:20] <Artea> since is made by ex-freenode IRCop

[19:46:26] * Khaytsus &
[19:47:16] <Artea> the harassment and spam is covered by Libera channel
[19:47:29] <Artea> but I have preparing a plan
[19:47:38] <Artea> since I "know" who is behind
[19:47:59] <Artea> I may get myself deep into the rabbit hole
[19:48:04] <Artea> and expose the group
[19:48:40] <Artea> I'm sure people would love to get the info and put the people behind of all this shit in jail for cyber-crime
[19:54:20] <DarthGandalf> cyber-jail maybe
[20:00:39] <reenix> Hey, been using ZNC on twitch lately. Unfortunately I don't get a user list. Does anyone have the same problem and is there a way around this limitation?
[20:02:25] <Khaytsus> ZNC on twitch??
[20:02:48] <Lartza> You need to request the :twitch.tv/membership CAP
[20:03:10] <Lartza> But it might not quite work like expected even then
[20:03:54] <reenix> Interesting enough it works when I use IRC directly
[20:03:54] <Khaytsus> I had no idea twitch had an irc interface, wow
[20:04:13] *** Joins: Pippin_ (Pippin_@openvpn/community/Pippin)
[20:04:32] <Lartza> It shouldn't, unless your client supports Twitch
[20:04:52] <Khaytsus> So how does that work, do you join channels which are twitch users I guess?
[20:05:08] <Lartza> Yeah basically one twitch channel is one irc channel
[20:05:17] <Khaytsus> I'll have to try this, I hate twitch's chat interface
[20:05:24] <Lartza> Joins/parts as well as userlist are not sent because the viewer count can be in tens of thousands or more
[20:05:42] <Lartza> So there are some caps you need to request to be sent those
[20:05:45] <Lartza> and some other stuff
[20:05:47] <reenix> Khaytsus yeah it does have IRC, but only to a certain point as it seems.
[20:05:55] <Khaytsus> Very interesting
[20:08:56] <Artea> there is also Discord <-> IRC
[20:09:10] <reenix> Lartza do you know if there is a plugin wich can do that automatically?
[20:09:44] <Artea> ZDIRC, modded version for ZDaemon (DOOM)
[20:09:59] <Artea> there is a channel there that they talk and shows up as [Discord]
[20:10:37] <Artea> so I presume they have a discord server with a bot with script that interacts with ZDIRC Bot
[20:11:11] <Artea> why I have a feeling that IRCv4 is coming soon ?
[20:11:26] <DarthGandalf> Artea: Discord <-> IRC? any links?
[20:12:19] <Artea> no, I have Discord Bot on google for 4 or 5 days open
[20:12:28] <Artea> and still dont had time to look at it
[20:12:47] <DarthGandalf> I'm using a bridge bot instead
[20:12:53] <Artea> right now isnt my big priority
[20:13:15] <Artea> I only use Discord for SexCoin and OpenRA
[20:13:54] <Artea> OpenRA uses bot on discord and IRC
[20:14:50] <Artea> with github bot
[20:14:56] <Artea> but dont know the extend of it

[22:18:59] <PeGaSuS> you can use PyLink (which can link as a server)
[22:19:51] <PeGaSuS> when linked as a server it acts like if the users were connected to the network, spawning them like `nick/discord`
[22:20:59] <PeGaSuS> it also has a clientbot (like a relaybot) but no matter what, you always need a `parent` network, iirc
[22:21:21] <PeGaSuS> I mean, you need at least one network where PyLink is connected as a server

[23:40:09] <Khaytsus> Well sure, nginx as a reverse proxy is even documented on the znc site, but not for irc.  Just the web UI.
[23:41:30] <MetaNova> you sure about that
[23:41:30] <MetaNova> https://wiki.znc.in/Reverse_Proxy#IRC
[23:42:15] <Khaytsus> Oh, I guess I'm not.  I thought I'd looked into it before
[23:42:23] <MetaNova> I was surprised, too
[23:42:51] <MetaNova> I don't even use a reverse proxy I just remember noticing that one day and thinking, "oh, neat, I didn't know that was possible"
[23:42:53] <Khaytsus> I could have sworn about a year or so ago someone was having trouble and it wasn't a thing, but this likely isn't new, so I"m misremembering ;)
[23:44:42] <MetaNova> looks like
[23:44:43] <MetaNova> https://wiki.znc.in/index.php?title=Reverse_Proxy&diff=prev&oldid=2627
[23:45:16] <MetaNova> was when the stream processing section was added
[23:45:29] <Khaytsus> Yep not new at all, neat. 
[23:45:57] <MetaNova> don't feel bad, I haven't even read the FAQ
[23:47:09] <Khaytsus> I had pondered swpaping to nginx some time ago just... kind of for giggles, since my "homepage" right now is a static list of my gitlab projects for some lame-ass SEO
[23:47:20] *** Quits: pierrot (~pi@user/pierrot) (Quit: ZNC 1.6.4 - http://znc.in)
[23:47:47] <Khaytsus> But I also have other stuff that ultimately uses it, so..  anywho
[23:47:52] <MetaNova> ah static pages
[23:47:59] <MetaNova> back when the web had some magic to it
[23:48:02] *** Joins: pierrot (~pi@user/pierrot)
[23:51:19] <Khaytsus> Yeah, I've had lots of stuff over the years...  but was just a blank page since I nuked a CMS that I wasn't updating some time ago, and google and all kinds of stuff keeps crawling so I was like screw it, use the SEO
[23:51:26] <Khaytsus> SEO isn't the right word, but.. yeah
[23:51:45] <MetaNova> keywords
[23:52:21] <Casper> Artea please take a look at http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.de/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html and then please change your habits to 'a lot' :D
[23:52:23] <Khaytsus> Well, to get crawled and linked..  but yeah
[23:52:43] <Khaytsus> Casper: You've bugged him alot about that
[23:52:45] * Khaytsus sneaks off
[23:52:52] <Casper> ;_;
[23:53:08] <Casper> I have, and 'alot' is just better than you and them at everything. >:D
[23:54:07] <DkrTremos> evening
[23:54:54] <MetaNova> /msg botname join #znc ; /msg botname messageparser add #znc ^.*\salot\s.*$ echo Did you mean 'a lot'?
[23:55:05] <MetaNova> let us automate, brothers and sisters
[23:56:24] <Khaytsus> Or weechat can, apparently, real time fix it..  someone the other day was wanting weechat to fix if he accidentally does all uppercase :D
[23:56:36] <MetaNova> even hexchat has inline replacement
[23:56:50] <MetaNova> (if you configure them yourself)
[23:57:01] <MetaNova> I use it to make 'etc' actually spell etcetera
[23:57:17] <Khaytsus> heh
