[00:57:33] <Cryowolf> heh signed up for 2 magasines in a trial subscription and it comes with a "gift" of wireless blutooth headphones valued at 80 euro
[00:57:41] <Cryowolf> cost me 10 euro
[00:59:16] <darkpeach> are they actually valued at 80 euro?
[00:59:48] <SpiritOfSummer> Guest42: yeah I saw what you said about dragon ball super and I agree
[01:00:10] <SpiritOfSummer> Guest42: and the goku black arc actually stumbles on a direct representation of what is wrong with dragon ball super
[01:00:21] <SpiritOfSummer> and it's the episode right after vegeta beats the fuck out of black
[01:00:32] <Cryowolf> it would be a crime in Sweden to lie about that
[01:00:49] <SpiritOfSummer> instead of escalating into 2 different high action battles, goku vs immortal zamasu and vegeta vs goku black
[01:00:51] <Cryowolf> either way theyre worth at least 10 euro
[01:00:59] <Guest42> True
[01:01:03] <SpiritOfSummer> they invented a completely novel episode with nonsensical elements
[01:01:11] <SpiritOfSummer> the cut in the sky was worthless, the clones made no sense
[01:01:21] <SpiritOfSummer> the sealing zamasu in a bottle was silliness
[01:01:44] <SpiritOfSummer> it didn't even make sense how zamasu got away from goku to go terrorize trunks and bulma
[01:02:14] <SpiritOfSummer> dragon ball z would have cranked the action up a dial, it was 1 episode for god sake. 
[01:02:43] <SpiritOfSummer> and they could have swapped opponents midway through the battle and had the novel super saiyan rose black vs super saiyan blue goku reach its final round
[01:03:01] <Guest42> Yeah, I agree
[01:03:31] <Cryowolf> so it was worth it
[01:03:51] <SpiritOfSummer> and I'm sure you'd agree that the fight with fused zamasu just had way too much talking.

[01:05:23] <Cryowolf> the total "package" where you saved money is valued at 80 cause I guess each magasine is gotten cheaper

[01:06:08] <Guest42> hassoon Yes, if you are lazy, you watch too much TV or something.
[01:06:09] <Cryowolf> metaphore
[01:06:11] <SpiritOfSummer> Guest42: have you heard the theory that future zeno is possessed by zamasu
[01:06:17] <hassoon> Guest42: what ?
[01:06:22] <Cryowolf> or rather figurative
[01:06:26] <Cryowolf> or whatever the word is
[01:06:28] <hassoon> Cryowolf: what metaphore
[01:06:30] <Guest42> SpiritOfSummer Interesting.
[01:06:45] <SpiritOfSummer> because zamasu was made immortal with the super dragon ball created by a god named zalama
[01:07:00] <SpiritOfSummer> and the power of that dragon is supposed to be infinite
[01:07:01] <Cryowolf> hassoon, the one youd understand if you scrolled up like 20 lines
[01:07:10] <SpiritOfSummer> so which infinity is bigger, the power that made zamasu immortal, or zeno?
[01:07:22] <SpiritOfSummer> and some people think that zeno failed to erase zamasu, and they fused into one being
[01:07:44] <SpiritOfSummer> and zamasu is slowly corrupting zeno's innocent nature, which is why you see him act slightly different sometimes, waving with the wrong hand, and then quickly correcting himself
[01:07:56] <hassoon> Cryowolf: no i won't scroll up
[01:08:05] <hassoon> Cryowolf: I WON'T

[01:42:43] <MootPoot> ah, ok hassoon 
[01:42:43] <SpiritOfSummer> I wouldn't mind having the approach to new seasons of dragon ball of comparing it to the manga as each episode comes out. 
[01:43:06] <hassoon> dragon ball in 2021 ? lel you're a joke
[01:43:20] <SpiritOfSummer> I waited all the way until the english dub to watch super. it was over 500 fucking days after

[10:39:04] <amigojapan> Yet again, I have never experienced -40c

[10:42:45] <emmeka> I think most people experience -40°C different from me, so I probably am not the best person to describe it. Cold doesn't tend to bother me very much and I'm sort of perceptive to when frostbite is going to set in.
[10:43:13] <amigojapan> I see
[10:45:22] <emmeka> but at those temperatures, boiling water freezes instantly, any and all humidity will just crystalize, which means when you breathe in it tends to freeze the inside of your nose. Exposed skin will be frostbit within relatively short time periods, being outdoors requires a lot of preparation.

[12:59:58] <analoq> thing is. i couldnt find the savegame. i went ahead and reinstalled the game. started it.
[13:00:14] <analoq> and the savegame was there, even thought it was a new container :O

[14:49:24] <analoq> dont you already have these transparent walls with doors in transtations that line up with the trains doors?

[15:00:30] <amigojapan> analoq: actually I stream then, somehow that is not considered illegal yet
[15:00:52] <amigojapan> But I will stop if they make that illegal
[15:01:11] <analoq> the issue with streaming is afaik that many of the streaming pages use some p2p system to distribute the bandwidth burden to the viewer
[15:01:21] <analoq> and i dont really know which pages do it and which dont
[15:02:01] <amigojapan> analoq: I think as long as you don't save it to your storage it's ok
[15:03:18] <analoq> well as soon as you watch it, you start sharing it. Which means you are part of a public p2p cloud, which should be problematic
[15:03:59] <amigojapan> analoq: I see. But still stored in my cache I think
[15:05:00] <analoq> yeah. But a data collector will just log all the ips and claim you shared said content (which you have). That would at least make you guilty in germany

[15:09:43] <amigojapan> analoq: like what
[15:09:52] <analoq> for now the reencoding effort is to expensive to justify it. But that's only a matter of time I am afraid.
[15:10:19] <analoq> you simply hide unique info in the image data of the movie specific to each client
[15:10:20] <DunceCotus> a touch polynomial

[15:54:51] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: by the way the word batsu (punishment) sounds the same as the word for X, I think that is why they get an X on their face

[16:43:16] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: they named the gods after the wondering stars

[16:45:49] <darkpeach> lol
[16:45:53] <analoq> with that i agree :)
[16:45:54] <amigojapan> Right analoq 
[16:46:05] <DunceCotus> astrology is meaningless until you find meaning in it
[16:46:35] <analoq> thats why it is meaningless
[16:46:50] <analoq> you dont create something and look in it for meaning. 
[16:46:52] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it's good to make anime based on it
[16:46:55] <analoq> science works the other way around
[16:46:55] <DunceCotus> the machinations of the celestial machines is connected to other machines
[16:47:12] <DunceCotus> analoq: science doesn't look for meaning
[16:47:46] <DunceCotus> science is not about meaning
[16:47:52] <analoq> meaning being  synonymous with explanation here
[16:47:53] <DunceCotus> when meaning is involved its religion
[16:48:15] <DunceCotus> science doesn't explain
[16:48:30] <DunceCotus> because explaining would be too final
[16:48:36] <DunceCotus> too authoritative
[16:48:44] <analoq> ive never heard of statistics being a big thing in astrology.
[16:49:00] <DunceCotus> that's cause statistics isn't for astrology, or vice versa
[16:49:07] <analoq> they dont quantify. they just made up something and then claimed a connection
[16:49:30] <DunceCotus> end of the day its perhaps more about the strengths/weaknesses of what is made of the thing

[16:54:38] *** Parts: Mija (~Mija@user/mija) ()
[16:55:32] <amigojapan> Let me see DunceCotus 
[16:56:20] <DunceCotus> this part is especially chilling (Aside from the end): "So, me and my rowdy teenage friends were all laughing and shouting to each other from elevator to elevator, and we could hear each other, but about halfway up, the other elevator sounded more drowned out, like speaking into a fan, and then we stopped hearing them altogether."
[16:58:30] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you really like stories by confused people
[16:58:39] <DunceCotus> confused?
[16:58:49] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: any number of factors could have changed the outcome
[16:59:12] <amigojapan> Yes DunceCotus confused like you
[16:59:13] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: if the OP is telling the truth then this is extremely odd
[16:59:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: what factors?
[16:59:30] <amigojapan> No it is not DunceCotus 
[17:00:08] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you know elevators go out of order, and also need to be inspected pretty often
[17:00:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: like his other friends in his elevator also looked at him with confused expression.. as if they experienced things differently to him
[17:00:31] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: that's not how the story goes though
[17:00:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the friends in the other elevator got to his apartment before him
[17:01:04] *** Quits: nekodesu (~bit@user/nekobit) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:01:07] <amigojapan> Yeah DunceCotus maybe his elevator went slowly
[17:01:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: he knows the speeds of these elevators, he's timed it
[17:01:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: he's lived there all his life
[17:01:37] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: that is not reliable
[17:01:45] <DunceCotus> why not?
[17:01:55] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: he would notice if the elevator was slower than usual
[17:01:59] <JesseDesu> !seen llamamoe
[17:02:00] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: llamamoe was last seen in ##anime 8 days and 18 hours ago: <Llamamoe> Nanobot: As a person knowledgeable about these things, would you call now a bad time to buy BTC for the purposes of purchasing something with it? I really if possible need to get this done ASAP 
[17:02:14] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: cause he is not an elevator expert
[17:02:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so only experts know things?
[17:02:45] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: only they can verify if he was right
[17:03:14] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: keep in mind the friends in his elevator were perplexed by his asking the other elevator friends how they got there so quickly
[17:03:27] <DunceCotus> it was as if the very people he shared the elevator with did not have the same experience as he did
[17:03:50] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: what if the other elevator went faster?
[17:04:08] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: then his friends would have said that?
[17:04:16] <DunceCotus> instead of giving puzzled looks
[17:04:26] <DunceCotus> that's what makes this a true glitch imi
[17:04:28] <DunceCotus> *imo
[17:04:34] <DunceCotus> the puzzled looks. I've seen that before
[17:04:35] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it was not even worth reading to the end. It is so dumb
[17:04:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: mate.
[17:05:17] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I think he swapped realities in that elevator
[17:05:31] <DunceCotus> or when he got into apartment

[17:06:12] <DunceCotus> that and crossroads
[17:06:24] <amigojapan> Nah DunceCotus , there needs to be a natural explanation to everything
[17:06:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its not dumb.. its Science
[17:06:35] <amigojapan> Nope
[17:06:39] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there is, but nature is a lot weirder than we thought

[22:11:47] <MootPoot> might have been some migration within the twitch watching community
[22:12:18] <MootPoot> but for everyone else its basically limited to occasional youtube clip binges
[22:12:28] <Bco1981> i don't watch twitch... which is kinda a double standard... since i use that as my streaming platform.
[22:12:45] <Bco1981> because youtube is a bitch about copyrights

[22:36:46] <Guest12> Anime music is good
[22:36:50] <MootPoot> but easier then the stupid hard custom maps
[22:37:01] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: lots

[22:38:42] <klaxa> dfch: obvious troll is obvious

[22:41:29] <MootPoot> but the idea is that mecha and magical girl dosen't really set the tone of what actually happens like for example a romance tag

[22:47:53] <MootPoot> tbh, magical girl = superpowers
[22:48:03] <MootPoot> just call it a show about kids with superpowers
[22:48:10] <MootPoot> magical girl term is dumb enough as it is

[23:07:20] <MootPoot> but really, are all of these studies with like random homemade cloth masks
[23:07:35] <MootPoot> or with actual N95s
[23:07:47] <MootPoot> and counting in people who chin diper their masks
[23:07:52] <dfch> at least it somewhat stops the spread. stop thinking about yourself, think about others

[23:12:15] <MootPoot> 30%?
[23:12:17] <MootPoot> 50%?
[23:12:31] <dfch> and you care deeply about yourself don't lie to me, it's internet, we all obliged to say truth and only truth here :)
