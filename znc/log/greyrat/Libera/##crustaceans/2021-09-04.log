[11:05:44] <martian67> discusses the feasibility of using meteorites as trace element fertilizer for geoengineering parts of the ocean to enable mass carbon sequestering
[11:06:14] <martian67> as out in the ocean those are the elements that are always the limiting factor for plant growth
[11:06:25] <martian67> so much so that most of the ocean is practically lifeless
[11:06:52] <martian67> since you only need the trace elements, you dont need insane amounts of meteorites
[11:07:27] <martian67> 1 ton of meteor might pull out 1000 tons of co2
[11:07:44] <martian67> maybe even better, might even be 10000
[11:10:56] <martian67> meteors are a much richer source of trace elements than earth rocks because most of them have sunk to the core
[11:14:17] <martian67> also discusses how to do it economicly
[11:27:04] <martian67> 1 ton of meteor might pull out 1000 or even 10000 tons of carbon out of the amosphere
