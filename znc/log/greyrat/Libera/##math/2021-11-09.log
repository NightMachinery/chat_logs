[00:01:59] <cuppajoeman> I see why when we have {(∃x) P(x), ~P(c)}, and a language with one constant (c) , no function symbols and the binary relation P. Then there is no model whose universe is the set of variable free terms (which is {c})
[00:02:30] <cuppajoeman> So in this specific case I can see that adding a new constant b, where P(b) holds true would fix it

[02:32:07] <kronicmage> "collatz(n) is true if when n is even we divide by 2, and when n is odd we multiply it by 3 and add 1" -> is collatz(n) a true/false value, or a natural number?
[02:32:40] <brownorange> collatz(n) means n is reducible to 1 by the collatz procedure
[02:33:31] <qergle> and what allows you to say collatz(n)⇒collatz(n+1)?
[02:34:11] <brownorange> qergle because it's under the curve ForAll n

[02:34:52] <qergle> i don't follow
[02:35:25] <kronicmage> brownorange, i don't think you can say that then. let's compare with the 5k+1 version: "collatz5k(n) is true if when n is even we divide by 2, and when n is odd we multiply it by 5 and add 1... collatz5k(n+1) should work the same way"
[02:35:46] <kronicmage> but the 5k+1 version is false, there is a non-trivial cycle that doesn't end at 1
[02:36:08] <qergle> ∀ n, collatz(n) *is* the collatz conjecture.
[02:36:14] <qergle> that's what's to be proved.
[02:37:11] <brownorange> hm i'll write up a more detailed proof, as for variants of collatz, i haven't thought about those
[02:37:24] <qergle> if "collatz(n)" means n eventually reaches 1 via iterated collatz procedure.
[02:37:58] <kronicmage> while you're writing that proof brownorange, please keep the 5k+1 variant in mind. it's statement is very similar to the original collatz conjecture, but is known to be false.
[02:38:16] <kronicmage> so somewhere in your proof your steps should fail on the 5k+1 version, while working for the 3k+1 version

[09:45:16] <lpapp> Hi. Hmm, is this task even solvable in its current definition? https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/13-fibonacci_numbers/ladder/ L is an integer within the range [1..50,000]; - each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..L]; - each element of array B is an integer within the range [1..30]. => If A[i] is like 50000, and B[i] is 1, that is not possible to return in an int, right? Maybe,
[09:45:22] <lpapp> they will only test the solution with A[i] and B[i] values that will guarantee int results?

[09:56:29] <W> pavonia, I don't see the issue, you return 1, since F_50000 is odd

[13:10:47] <tomeaton17> can anyone recommend a good book on probability and stochastic processes? I am currently doing a masters course on it, https://www.amazon.co.uk/Probability-Random-Variables-Stochastic-Processes/dp/0071226613/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8 is the recommended text, but I don't think it explains very well. For example it just tells us the
[13:10:47] <tomeaton17> definition for the characteristic function, but offers no explanation about what it actually is and how we arrive there.

[15:01:53] <Z-module> cadmio, the write-up has a typo in 2nd line of bottom part: should be  consider the subgroup HT/T <| N_G(T)/T
[15:03:18] <Z-module> Now note that |N_G(T)/T| =  |N_G(T)| / |T| = |N_G(T)| / p^a    and this number can't have p as a divisor, since that would mean the subgroup N_G(T) would have order divisible by  p^(a+1)   but not subgroup of G does this  (the a is maximal).
[15:03:55] <Z-module> and HT/T  is a subgroup of this N_G(T)/T  so it too can't have order divisible by p
[15:04:59] <cadmio> yes there was a typo
[15:05:01] <Z-module> and for subgroups of G, having order not divisible by p is the same as having order that divides m

Then the collection of all left cosets of B partitions the set K into disjoint subsets each of size |B|, so |K| = |B|*(# of left cosets of B).  Let |K:B| denote that second factor -- just some number. So |K| = |B| |K:B|, or  |K:B| = |K|/|B|.  This always holds. If B also happens to be normal, then that collection of all the left cosets *also* forms

[17:08:24] <isekaijin> joel135: The “use” simply seems to be to construct a model of linear logic, which seems to be useful for computer scientists for some reason, but I do not see why an algebraic geometer should care.
[17:10:03] <joel135> how about "Ring-spaces" which are functors Ring -> Set - is it invalid to consider this notion as a case of presheaves?

[18:55:18] <isekaijin> It is probably more convenient to write z = (x1, x3) and w = (x2, x4), and then ask whether f(z, w) = |z - w| is convex.
[18:55:36] <isekaijin> But it suffices to restrict this function to lines.
[18:56:05] <cheater> if you set x3 and x4 = 0 then you have |x1-x2| and that's just euclidean distance. is this concave, drobi ?

[19:38:54] <greenbagels> tolarz: heh
[19:39:08] <tolarz> i was in hospital 3 weeks ago lol, but now my toe fracture is converging.
[19:39:10] <tolarz> guess it worked?
[19:39:42] <isekaijin> Guest5918: Anyhow, I was going to say that you could just prove that y_n is bounded and eventually monotonic.
[19:39:53] <isekaijin> Anything to avoid unnecessary uses of L'Hôpital.
[19:39:56] <Guest5918> that seems like more work
[19:40:07] <tolarz> All uses of L'Hospital are unnecessary.
[19:40:14] <Teofrastus> @tolarz This is my first time on IRC so i hope I tagged you Tolarz. AFAIK there is a general formula for differentiating functions written as a^x: a^x * ln(a)
[19:40:26] <Z-module> Guest5918: you can also use  ln(1 + 2e^n) < ln(2e^n + 2e^n) = n + ln(4) , and that divided by n -> 1.   Your original sequence is positive and increasing, so this gives convergence.
[19:40:27] <cherim> For once I liked a qed's joke, about concrete examples being best in civil engineering
[19:40:30] <isekaijin> L'Hôpital makes this too easy. If you want to test whether students actually understand convergence, don't teach L'Hôpital at all.
[19:40:36] <Guest5918> i guess to be fair, I don't understand why it works
[19:40:42] <Guest5918> its just a magic tool to me
[19:41:02] <isekaijin> ^ That is why I do not want to teach L'Hôpital.

[19:41:19] <cherim> I want "Concrete mathematics" use to be restricted to civil engineering department, and L'Hospital use for mental hospitals
[19:41:54] <cherim> It's usually a sign of people not comfortable with / not feeling inequalities on the real line and trying to hide behind simple formal manipulation rules
[19:42:12] <Guest5918> Z-module sorry, why is not always increasing?
[19:43:40] <qergle> Guest5918: an observation is that as limiting behavior (ie large n), ln(1+2e^n) ~ ln(2e^n)
[19:43:47] <greenbagels> isekaijin: there's a simple solution to this
[19:43:49] <cherim> Like that person who refused to discuss the definition of the limit and insisted that we only explain proofs of existence (of limits) in terms "the limit exists because it is X where X is from 'limit of sum is equal to sum of limits'" etc.

[19:45:55] <greenbagels> note: you should probably have tenure before doing this
[19:46:09] <qergle> and ln(2)/n becomes a non-issue, leaving n/n.
[19:46:23] <qergle> heuristically, this sequence's terms converge to 1
[19:47:48] <Guest5918> qergle can we back up a step. I get how ln(1+2e^n) ~ ln(2e^n), but where did the e^n go in what you just wrote?

[21:50:56] <riv> https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zejcoyqhz7
[21:51:25] <riv> you could try to prove it by proving that LHS is a flipped verison of RHS around pi/4

[21:51:44] <hk238> yup riv I know this much already, and I thought you could use symmetry, but is there a more general way to deal with them?
[21:52:07] <riv> why did you ask then :/
[21:53:14] <hk238> Because I thought there might be a solution that somehow deals with this algebraically, but maybe I was wrong and  there isn't.

[22:02:39] <Decker> somiaj that's also 'the' solution, but how would you guess that? what sort of line of reasoning?
[22:03:12] <somiaj> Decker: It is mostly just obvious that one set of solutions to a^b = b^a is just a = b, after that you can then argue that no other solutions exists.
[22:03:21] <somiaj> also 'the' is probably missleading, as there are more than one solution

[22:09:04] <somiaj> You could also change the equation into a ln(b) = b ln(a) or ln(b)/b = ln(a)/a, so lets look at the function f = ln(x)/x, here f' = (1 - ln(x))/x^2 so f' = 0 if x = e, and f' > 0 if x < e, and f' < 0 if x > e
[22:09:53] <somiaj> now since sin(x), cos(x) <= 1 < e, there must be unique solution with 0 < a,b < 1
[22:10:23] <somiaj> thus sin(x) = cos(x) with sin(x),cos(x) > 0 gives a unique solution.
