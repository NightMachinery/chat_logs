[02:30:08] <MetaNova> unused vacation time is paid out
[02:30:09] <bin> depends on if it's paid vacation or not
[02:30:21] <bin> and also depends on the company policies tbh
[02:30:27] <MetaNova> obviously unpaid vacation isn't paid out
[02:30:28] <gneeriiloeepdeer> I though in America there are no paid holidays...
[02:30:38] <bin> that's just propaganda
[02:30:45] <MetaNova> gneeriiloeepdeer: there are, just fewer and ^
[02:30:50] <bin> I have 3 weeks paid vacation and unlimited unpaid time off
[02:31:09] <gneeriiloeepdeer> unlimited unpaid time off > sick days?
[02:31:21] <MetaNova> sick/personal/otherwise unavailable, yes
[02:31:33] <gneeriiloeepdeer> holy crap...
[02:31:37] <bin> yeah it just means I don't get paid for it though
[02:31:39] <gneeriiloeepdeer> I want that
[02:31:45] <gneeriiloeepdeer> oh
[02:31:51] <gneeriiloeepdeer> sorry
[02:31:56] <gneeriiloeepdeer> didnt read it enough
[02:31:58] <bin> but some companies have unlimited paid time off as long as it's used reasonably
[02:32:06] <MetaNova> gneeriiloeepdeer: unlimited as in, you're not going to get into trouble for using too much unpaid time off -- but it still needs to be approved
[02:32:08] <bin> like you couldn't take 6 months without some kind of special consideration
[02:33:31] <gneeriiloeepdeer> is it also that the case in Canada, or are they more 'european'?
[02:34:18] <MetaNova> it can vary dramatically by company and position
[02:34:40] <MetaNova> generalizing these things on a regional/continental basis can easily be misleading
[02:35:28] <MetaNova> I can't speak to if Canadian business/employee-relation practices are more "European" or "American"
[02:38:25] <bin> yeah there's not federally mandated vacation time in the US, if that's what you're thinking
[02:38:36] <bin> that's why people say the US does't have vacation days because federally we don't
[02:39:01] <bin> but literally every company I've worked for, including low-level retail jobs, excluding temp jobs, gave at least SOME paid vacation
[02:39:10] <MetaNova> same
[02:39:13] <gneeriiloeepdeer> oh, might be the case, so each states chooses how many vacation days employers must offer their employees?
[02:39:36] <MetaNova> it depends on state and company
[02:39:46] <MetaNova> it may vary between state for the same company
[02:42:35] <MetaNova> I'm not sure at what rate I accrue paid vacation, but I have about 100 hours available at the moment
[02:44:38] <bin> I just get 3 weeks per year which renews at my anniversary and doesn't roll over. it's in hour but idr offhand the exact hours
[02:44:55] <bin> some companies will have you accrue more time based on how much time you work

[17:21:53] <twb> tinsoldier: "being moved" probably refers to an emotional response
[17:21:55] <tinsoldier> I'm not sure what you mean.
[17:22:46] <twb> upupbb-user5: e.g. Phillips's mum was raped but he kept working, and that made Bride feel impressed and proud

[21:39:08] <huf> life finds a way
[21:40:59] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: Whoever designed them clearly has not encountered birds, raccoons, bears, monkeys etc.
[21:41:03] *** Joins: pp4mnk (~pp4mnkpup@200.red-83-52-213.dynamicip.rima-tde.net)
[21:41:33] <kurahaupo> We don't have raccoons or bears or monkeys
[21:42:04] <huf> but it looks like you've got various kinds of bin chicken
[21:42:24] <kurahaupo> They normally work quite well here; this is the first documented case of non-primates opening them in this country
[21:42:35] <CuriosTiger> Ah.
[21:42:40] <CuriosTiger> Raccoons here will get in.
[21:42:45] <kurahaupo> Ibis aren't clever enough to learn that trick
[21:42:47] <huf> now the arms race is on :)
[21:43:05] <huf> kurahaupo: so these are bin chicken royalty then? :)
[21:43:54] <kurahaupo> New Zealand does have a bird species that is smart enough to open wheelie bins, but they don't like living at low altitude, so they don't visit cities
[21:44:06] <huf> haha
[21:44:49] *** Quits: exvicesindaco (~exvicio@user/exvicesindaco) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:45:04] <kurahaupo> However skiers and hikers often encounter Kia. They can open almost anything
[21:46:12] <kurahaupo> sorry, Kea
[21:47:24] <kurahaupo> https://www.google.com/search?q=kea+open+car+video&oq=kea+open+car&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j33i160l3.7035j0j9&client=ms-android-oppo-rev1&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:d805ec0c,vid:fBdvRCkCNfo,st:0
[21:49:26] <huf> so they just randomly try to get into everything?
[21:49:42] <kurahaupo> https://youtu.be/c6vY0s83NLg
[21:49:52] <CuriosTiger> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kea -- they have even been described as "cheeky".
[21:49:54] <kurahaupo> Intelligent and bored
[21:50:06] <huf> i'm watching them go for the rubber seals on a cop car :D
[21:51:29] <darsie> Lions learned to open safari tourist cars.
[21:51:45] <kurahaupo> They don't always succeed, but they do get in often enough that insurance companies don't write you off as a crank for claiming "Kea damage"
[21:52:38] <huf> I dont think we have any funny/destructive animals
[21:52:40] <CuriosTiger> Lions can be both curious and playful.
[21:52:54] <huf> except cats and dogs, you know...
[21:53:44] <huf> not since we killed all the bears
[21:54:22] <kurahaupo> Apparently Great White Sharks are "just being curious" when they snibble on humans; the fact that some actually survive is testimony to their lack of serious hungry intent
[21:54:42] <CuriosTiger> kurahaupo: I've also heard it's sometimes a case of mistaken identity
[21:54:47] <kurahaupo> Bears open car doors by using the door handle
[21:54:50] <huf> oh we do have bears now
[21:54:53] <huf> probably like 12 of them
[21:54:58] <CuriosTiger> hence no follow-up after the first bite. "This prey doesn't taste good."
[21:55:30] <kurahaupo> "a bit like a seal but not salty enough"
[21:56:40] <huf> maybe they just hate our diet
[21:56:42] <huf> our meat stinks of mcdonalds
[21:56:48] <kurahaupo> "also, they pack-hunt from huge warm iceburgs that make thumpy noises"
