[01:44:58] <sarnold> whenever you stuff a new machine on the internet, it gets probed for a huge number of flaws nearly immediately, and if you've got unsafe configurations, or out of date software, it's entirely possible for a machine to be compromised within minutes

[01:45:53] <sarnold> so, be sure to turn off ssh password authentication and use only ssh keys; do periodic checks of what services are listening on the machine, make sure they are properly configured; make sure unattended-upgrades is working correctly or you've otherwise got a mechanism to install updates in a timely manner..

[07:30:39] <sarnold> Lebela: hmmm, curious.. I wonder if that double-cable is necessary to supply power on *both* cables for the device
[07:31:13] <Lebela> but it also worked for the past 5 months
[07:31:18] <sarnold> Lebela: there's also a chrome segfault in here, there's lots of possible reasons for that.. but insufficient or unreliable power is a possibilty there, too

[07:43:08] <sarnold> Lebela: I'm headed out for the night.. my thoughts (a) power causes weird problems, it's worth considering replacing system power supplies, or trying external power supplies for usb hubs, etc, (b) that segfault *might* be a hardware fault due to memory, or due to power... memtest86 or memtest86+ could help find out if you've got bad memory. *maybe* bad memory could lead to this read-only filesystem
[07:43:14] <sarnold> problem, too, I'm less sure

[08:09:09] <Lebela> re
[08:09:18] <Lebela> I would like to disable all logging
[08:09:42] <Lebela> 1) I opened  "/etc/rsyslog.conf"
[08:10:04] <Lebela> 2) I commented the line starting with:   $IncludeConfig
[08:10:15] <Lebela> 3) service rsyslog restart
[08:10:35] <Lebela> Error:
[08:10:36] <Lebela> $ sudo service rsyslog restart
[08:10:36] <Lebela> Job for rsyslog.service failed because the control process exited with error code.
[08:10:36] <Lebela> See "systemctl status rsyslog.service" and "journalctl -xeu rsyslog.service" for details.
[08:11:09] <Lebela> the moment I remove the hash which I added in 2) it works again
[08:11:27] <Lebela> Question:  How to really disable logging (also after rebooting)
[08:11:44] <tomreyn> the easiest way to disable rsyslogd is probably to uninstall it, second easiest will be to mask the systemd service unit
[08:11:44] <Lebela> my own idea would be:   sudo chattr +i /var/log/
[08:11:50] <Lebela> not sure if that's good
[08:12:05] <tomreyn> but you'll still have systemd-journald logging also
[08:12:27] <tomreyn> why no logs, though? that's rather unusual
[08:12:28] <Lebela> uninstalling could be a bad thing, because I might need it someday
[08:12:41] <Lebela> tomreyn, because I am editing 4K videos and I need every tiny little bit of space on my device
[08:12:49] <Lebela> I cannot afford the logs eat up so many gigabytes
[08:13:00] <tomreyn> how many are they eating up now?

[08:13:23] <tomreyn> hmm, well then i'd just get more / larger disks
[08:13:45] <tomreyn> and have the video editing take place on a different file system for sure
[08:13:45] <Lebela> where does the systemd-journald logging get stored?
[08:13:48] <Lebela> also in /var/log?
[08:13:50] *** Parts: cgrage_ (~cgrage@107.174.17.132) ()
[08:13:58] <tomreyn> yes, /var/log/journal
[08:14:09] <Lebela> I try to chattr +i  my way out of this misery now
[08:14:10] <Lebela> brb
[08:14:13] <tomreyn> chattr -i will most likely have adverse side effects.
[08:14:30] <tomreyn> like processes cnosuming much cpu because they loop
[08:14:58] <tomreyn> well, not most likely, but it's well possible
[08:15:20] <tomreyn> it's probably not the best approach achieve your goals
[08:15:26] <Lebela> ok then chattr is no option
[08:15:33] <Lebela> I need the cpu for my videos
[08:16:36] <tomreyn> so how about get 'more storage' and 'store files you work with on a different file system'?
[08:17:14] <Lebela> yep, I will have to go down that road
[08:17:20] <Lebela> thank you tomreyn !
[08:17:27] <Lebela> oh, one more thing:
[08:17:35] <Lebela> you said, chattr +i loops all the time
[08:17:44] <Lebela> only when somebody tries to write to said directory?
[08:17:46] <tomreyn> no, not what i said
[08:17:47] <Lebela> or _always_ ?

[08:25:50] <tomreyn> Lebela: i think "beep" usually tries to output a sound on an internal pc speaker (a "buzzer"), bypassing the sound card
[08:26:40] <tomreyn> though there are also implmentations which will output a single frequency sound via the sound card.

[08:27:05] <Lebela> what is the easiest no-trouble way of making my bash script beep?
[08:27:42] <matsaman> Lebela: possibly 'echo', but perhaps more realistically you should simply use mplayer, mpv, or aplay
[08:28:01] <matsaman> or: echo 'Hey hey, the thing is done!' | flite

[23:50:34] <sarnold> depending upon what's going on on your system, it could be a fork bomb that quits quickly, those can hide pretty effectively

[23:51:36] <axsuul> leftyfb: I'm not sure if it's due to an individual process, but is load strictly due to high CPU usage?
[23:52:05] <leftyfb> axsuul: how are you determining there is high load?
[23:52:49] <axsuul> in top, it's showing 1m 5m and 15m is above 25, and I only have 16 cores, also system is behaving slowly
