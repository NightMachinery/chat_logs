[07:44:23] <PattyCakes> something something animals only
[07:44:25] <PattyCakes> lol
[07:47:12] <PattyCakes> key thing here is to not microwave the budder. You'll end up with some burnt nasty shit. ALso when dipping in and out of the hot water, you don't want to to liquify too quickly. Take your time, do it slow, THC starts to decarb at 230-250, so you don't want a roaring boil going on

[23:36:35] <signofzeta> vinrock: though you can boot them remotely as a poor man's smart outlet, but it's not convenient
[23:36:53] <vinrock> i thought the way they work is monitoring for the ssid and if it dissapears, it sends a reboot
