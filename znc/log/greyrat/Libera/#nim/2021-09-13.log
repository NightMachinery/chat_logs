[02:18:26] <arkanoid> no, getting js errors with that and repr
[02:19:18] <arkanoid> the only way I'm able to get something out of a JsObject is to create a ref object type with known field and use myJsObject.to(FooType).repr
[02:20:02] <arkanoid> for example echo (clickEvent.JsObject).latlng.to(LatLng).repr
[02:21:02] <arkanoid> the '$' function does not exist for JsObject
[02:22:50] <arkanoid> well, obviously also "echo (clickEvent.JsObject).latlng.to(LatLng)[]" works

[05:51:36] <arfy> hi. wehn it comes to wrappers for libraries, what's the general idiom? To have a thin wrapper, with types close to the C interface, or to provide sweetened syntax?
[05:55:04] <FromDiscord> <auxym> Personal preference I guess, but I prefer an idiomatic nim API hiding the unsafe C FFI stuff under it. I'd rather not have to deal with cstrings and ptrs
[05:55:57] * arfy nods. I'm currently looking into the nimbass package from nimble, and it seems to be an auto-generated wrapper with ninterop
[05:58:29] <FromDiscord> <auxym> Writing a nice idiomatic nim on top is likely a lot of manual work, yeah. If you want, you can write a wrapper over the stuff you're going to use in your project only
[06:00:56] <arfy> yeah. I might do that. I really just need a simple playFile function. but bass is the library I'm familiar with.
