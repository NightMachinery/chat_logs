[02:11:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Only RSA... ok what's the best sort of RSA key
[02:12:29] <Betawolf> like with other weapons, bigger is better
[02:12:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is 4096 bit the biggest
[02:13:49] <Betawolf> I think that's the biggest RSA generally used, yeah.
[02:16:11] <gwern> ('The longer the key you are trying to generate, the longer this takes. Randy is trying to generate one that is ridiculously long. He has pointed out to Avi, in an encrypted e-mail message, that if every particle of matter in the universe could be used to construct one single cosmic supercomputer, and this computer was put to work trying to break a 4096-bit encryption key, it would take...
[02:16:17] <gwern> ...longer than the lifespan of the universe. "Using today‚Äôs technology," Avi shot back. "that is true. But what about quantum computers? And what if new mathematical techniques are developed that can simplify the factoring of large numbers?" "How long do you want these messages to remain secret?" Randy asked, in his last message before leaving San Francisco. "Five years? Ten years?...
[02:16:23] <gwern> ...Twenty-five years?" After he got to the hotel this afternoon, Randy decrypted and read Avi‚Äôs answer. It is still hanging in front of his eyes, like the afterimage of a strobe:     `I want them to remain secret for as long as men are capable of evil.`    The computer finally beeps. Randy rests his tired hand.')
[02:16:52] <mjr> 8k is done but it's a bit overdoing it. Bigger in some special circumstances (certification requirements for top secret data where somebody has just said that 8k doesn't cut it; probably the idea is to use a more space-efficient algorithm but if you're gonna RSA, you go bigger)

[06:16:45] <Ralith> I'm not sure which sense of the idiom they're using
[06:31:50] <quanticle> I like The Browser, but sometimes they post the dumbest shit:
[06:31:52] <quanticle> "Even as many businesses struggle to keep afloat during the pandemic and consumers struggle to afford consumer goods that have seen prices surge to 31-year highs, the pandemic has been generous to the container shipping industry, with profits at record highs. Mega-ship companies see the increased risk of their business model not as a problem to solve but as an opportunity to exploit. They have
[06:31:54] <quanticle> no reason to fix the backlog; they‚Äôre too busy making money off it."
[06:31:56] <quanticle> https://prospect.org/economy/hidden-costs-of-containerization/
[06:31:56] <Robomot> The Hidden Costs of Containerization - The American Prospect (How the unsustainable growth of the container ship industry led to the supply chain crisis)
[06:31:58] <quanticle> Ah yes, shipping is so extremely terribly profitable, that's why there were so many bankruptcies among shipping companies in the GFC. All those profits, they didn't know what to do with them so they went out of business!
[06:32:00] <quanticle> Shipping is like airlines. When times are good, they're very good, and when they're bad, you have ships that are costing you like a million dollars a week and zero revenue.
[06:33:10] <quanticle> You can't look at just the feasts and ignore the famines.
[06:34:33] <gwern> I think it's partially a misguided sense of balance

[06:39:40] <nshepperd2> " They have no reason to fix the backlog; they‚Äôre too busy making money off it." how would this work
[06:40:13] <nshepperd2> i thought normally the way you make money off a backlog is by entering the market to clear it and charging super high prices
[06:41:38] <gwern> I suppose the intuition is that demand is inelastic and the backlog is a de facto monopoly or cartel: no one can undercut the ultra-high prices because the ports are physically full
[06:41:57] <quanticle> gwern: Incredibly bold move: https://twitter.com/dillonliam/status/1488998508292022272
[06:41:58] <Robomot> Liam Dillon (@dillonliam): "Wealthy Silicon Valley suburb Woodside ‚Äî median household income $250k ‚Äî declares the entire town "mountain lion habitat" in an attempt to sidestep a new state law allowing duplexes on single-family home lots https://www.almanacnews.com/news/2022/02/02/woodside-freezes-sb-9-projects-with-town-citing-excemption-for-mountain-lion-habitats" ( ‚Ä¶)
[06:42:07] <gwern> so _X_ shipping containers go through either way, but now the shippers can charge $30k instead of $3k per countainer or something
[06:42:41] <quanticle> Later: <homeowners pets getting eaten by cougars>
[06:42:45] <quanticle> Me: lol
[06:44:01] <nshepperd2> so the backlog *can't* be cleared?
[06:44:04] <gwern> 'When asked if critics would argue invoking the clause is a ploy to avoid having to build more housing, Mayor Dick Brown said that it's "not the Woodside way" to value housing over the preserving the environment. "We love animals," he said. "Every house that's built is one more acre taken away from (mountain lions') habitat. Where are they going to go? Pretty soon we'll have nothing but...
[06:44:10] <gwern> ...asphalt and no animals or birds."' <-- we need to draw a line in the sand! not a single more house in our backyards! just the ones that are already there
[06:44:29] <nshepperd2> or perhaps it can but only in a way that requires coordination between shippers and has a free rider problem, so there's no incentive to do it
[06:44:45] <gwern> nshepperd2: I'm not sure it can be, entirely. there's a lot of regulation and environmentalism and unions in the way of expanding or changing ports
[06:45:12] <gwern> the problem is demand is up massively. and I have no idea when if ever the shipping supply can increase to match
[06:45:50] <quanticle> I'm just here for the tech worker maulings
[06:53:28] <gwern> I don't think there's going to be any more maulings

[08:55:44] <PlanckWalk> Hmm, ~10k games per year, ~8G people.  That's what, about 0.001% of people producing games?
[08:56:21] <kuudes> 10/8_000_000
[08:56:43] <kuudes> so 12/10_000_000 = 1.2/1_000_000
[08:56:51] <PlanckWalk> I figure maybe 10 people would be involved in producing an average indie game
[08:57:15] <kuudes> make it 8 so the numbers match better
[08:57:22] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that would be nicer.
[08:57:23] <kuudes> 80/8_000_000

[09:00:06] <PlanckWalk> So I guess compared with musicians and other artists, we should be making a lot more games.

[09:01:26] <quanticle> (That's 'revenue' for the Americans in the chat)
[09:01:56] <PlanckWalk> About 1000x as many new songs as new games.
[09:02:18] <PlanckWalk> Which is fair enough as games are more labour intensive
[09:02:21] <PlanckWalk> But not 1000x more
[09:03:49] <PlanckWalk> Hmm, estimated about 5 million books self-published per year
[09:04:43] <PlanckWalk> Yep, there's definitely a scarcity of games.
[09:06:51] <kuudes> well music industry gets tax money or tax-like money
[09:08:12] <quanticle> Not in the US. Here music and games both operate under the same copyright regime. There isn't, e.g. a tax on recording media that subsidizes music.
[09:10:21] <kuudes> any foundations or similar to fund music?
[09:10:58] <PlanckWalk> There's no need. There are millions of people who want to produce it, and will do it for next to nothing.

[11:05:52] <adiabatty> because they're linux nerds and don't listen to mac nerds complain about the stupid shit Apple does
[11:05:54] <quanticle> I needed something with proper open-source drivers
[11:05:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> We plugged a USB-C port into your USB-C port
[11:06:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yo dawg etc.

[11:09:02] <nshepperd2> looks like it's just torx?
[11:09:09] <PapuaHardyNet> this screwdriver is their competitive moat
[11:09:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> No it's

[11:10:05] <nshepperd2> wtf why would they use philips
[11:10:13] <nshepperd2> philips heads suck
[11:10:23] <quanticle> Yeah, especially on tiny screws
[11:10:30] <quanticle> They round out so easily
[11:10:46] <quanticle> (Granted, not as badly as friggin' pentalobe, but still)
[11:11:54] <quanticle> All that said, though, I still like the Framework.
[11:11:58] <saturn2> PapuaHardyNet: old thinkpads aren't gonna last forever and new ones are garbage
[11:11:59] <quanticle> And I'll probably get one eventually
[11:12:18] <quanticle> When this Thinkpad dies, it'll probably be Framework for me.
[11:12:31] <PapuaHardyNet> it won't die! it will live forever in my heart
[11:13:02] <nshepperd2> they're designed to round out so you don't destroy stuff when screwdriving with a power drill (instead the head gets destroyed). so, pure suck on a laptop
[11:13:45] <PapuaHardyNet> (you could also buy multiple old thinkpads and switch whenever one stops working)
[11:14:12] <feep[work]> I have a reasonably new thinpkad.
[11:14:21] <feep[work]> it's still prettygood.
[11:15:13] <adiabatty> what is the best screw type for teeny screws? flathead?
[11:15:31] <quanticle> Torx
[11:15:35] <nshepperd2> torx, yeah
[11:17:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: But what if someone takes a power drill to their laptop, eh??
[11:17:09] <quanticle> Overall, I don't think I've ever seen a Phillips head screw and thought, yeah, no, this is the appropriate screw, there is no other screw head I'd rather have.
[11:18:04] <adiabatty> when I use flatheads sometimes the screwdriver falls out
[11:18:07] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: then a valuable lesson shall be learned
[11:18:09] <adiabatty> they're kind of annoying
[11:18:26] <adiabatty> but I don't have to worry about stripping them
[11:18:50] <quanticle> For general use (i.e. on wood, etc), I like square-recess screws
[11:19:11] <nshepperd2> perhaps they shall even see the light of arachno-communism, looking in at the shattered remains of what used to be their laptop
[11:19:36] <quanticle> Also, w.r.t. to Phillips, you have the whole Phillips/Pozidriv mess, where you have two bit types whose screws appear identical at first glance, but aren't
[11:20:31] <nshepperd2> haha yeah
[11:20:47] <nshepperd2> and using the wrong bit instantly strips the head and ruins your day

[11:33:07] <saturn2> now they're down to 1.35!!!
[11:33:29] <synthmeat> they would've shaved even more if they knew how!
[11:33:55] <quanticle> I think my Thinkpad has 1.8mm
[11:34:12] <synthmeat> new macs are, what, 1mm?
[11:34:13] <quanticle> Definitely less key travel than the old T420, but not *awful*
[11:34:30] <quanticle> synthmeat: The old new Macs or the new new Macs?
[11:34:37] <synthmeat> new new
[11:34:44] <quanticle> I think it's a bit more than 1
[11:34:49] <quanticle> Like 1.2 or something
[11:35:05] <quanticle> As opposed to the butterfly keyboard, which was like... below 1mm
[11:36:11] <quanticle> I had one of those as a work machine for a while. That was the only laptop where I felt like an external keyboard was absolutely necessary. I'm usually not that picky when it comes to laptop keyboards, but with that one, typing felt like slamming your fingers into a sheet of solid metal.
[11:37:28] <quanticle> So anyway, I'm looking at this Framework laptop, and they don't have wired Ethernet as one of their expansion card options‚ÄΩ
[11:37:31] <quanticle> For shame!
[11:38:22] <synthmeat> sure. but they have other nice things that maaaybe make up for it longer term, like, keys not jiggling after few years of use (nearly as much as other laptops i've used)
[11:38:50] <synthmeat> it's kinda pointless to discuss ergonomics on the laptops though, it's either "bad" or "terrible"
[11:39:39] <quanticle> Arguable as to whether the butterfly keys were more durable than the scissor switches they replaced. The entire time Apple was using butterfly switches, they were dogged by reports of people having issues with dust entry into the keyboard causing malfunctions.
[11:40:19] <quanticle> It was supposedly possible to clear with canned air, but it didn't always work and what, are you going to constantly carry a can of refrigerant with you in case you get some dust in your keyboard?
[11:41:11] <synthmeat> all ppl i know who got into macbooks in that period borderline left apple completely because of that
[11:41:43] <synthmeat> it wasn't even just keyboard, there was lots of other issues
[11:42:00] <quanticle> Touchbar, lol
[11:42:03] <synthmeat> lol
[11:42:27] <quanticle> My current work laptop is one of the newer Macbook Pros, which has the touchbar, but also the physical escape key
[11:42:43] <quanticle> I was (pleasantly) surprised to see that the newest ones get rid of the touchbar entirely
[11:43:10] <quanticle> I figured that Apple had committed to the touchbar
[11:44:40] <synthmeat> i thought it may be some usage data-collecting towards something maybe awesome (like, full glass 3d touch keyboard or smth), but it was clear it failed after a while
[11:45:48] <PapuaHardyNet> full glass cannot also be 3d, can it?
[11:47:38] <synthmeat> sure. but smth futuristic like that.

[11:53:15] <mjr> Eh. Generally you don't accidentally save as utf-16 on Linux because software doesn't do that Just Because unlike on Windows or something.

[12:03:28] <quanticle> To open it up, you unscrew the screws on the bottom... and then you have to flip it over and hinge the keyboard out of the way, taking care not to damage the cable connecting the keyboard to the motherboard in the process

[13:23:29] <feep[work]> this is why kde is the best
[13:23:50] <feep[work]> the kde quake terminal emulator (yakuake) had a bugfix a year or so ago, where it started registering as a tool window
[13:23:54] <feep[work]> rather than a regular window
[13:24:02] <feep[work]> this meant that it no longer showed up in alt-tab, which apparently had been a bug
[13:24:14] <feep[work]> unfortunately, that bug was now deeply ingrained in my workflow

[13:59:32] <Robomot> Falling Into The Pit of Success (a blog by Jeff Atwood on programming and human factors)
[13:59:37] <Gurkenglas> saturn2, it validates the impulse to design something that tries to make users do clever things and not stupid things
[13:59:39] <nshepperd> Obormot\Arcturus: i love the idea but why *white chocolate* of all things
[13:59:53] <nshepperd> strawberries go great with regular chocolate!
[14:00:32] <feep[work]> and I think the difference is that the pit of success metaphor is necessarily empirical
[14:00:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd: My guess is that by "white chocolate" what they actually mean is "hydrogenated soybean oil, high fructose corn syrup, and food coloring"
[14:00:44] <nshepperd> ah yes of course
[14:00:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd: Note the allergen warning
[14:00:50] <feep[work]> ie. if (some of) your users are systematically dodging all attempts to pull them into the pit of success, there may be something else going on
[14:01:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: I also do not get the connection of your math thing to absolutely anything UX-related
[14:01:49] <Gurkenglas> in other words, in reply to that aphorism (how precisely did it go?) that there's no such thing as a programming language that makes it impossible to shoot your foot off: yet.
[14:01:55] <nshepperd> mm soy lecithin is a common chocolate additive to prevent it from clumping or something
[14:02:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd: Totally, totally, it could be perfectly innocent, but there's also no ingredients list, and how the heck would they infuse actual chocolate (of any color) into strawberries? It's all very suspicious
[14:02:30] <nshepperd> it's possible it's actual chocolate, to whatever degree that is possible when it is "white chocolate"
[14:02:40] <nshepperd> yeah true true
[14:04:22] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, I suspect that devs that try to rule out stupid things are driven to find the One True UI, and I say this is not as foolish as it sounds on its face.
[14:05:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> But why
[14:05:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why isn't it foolish
[14:06:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Not that I think the premise is true either)
[14:09:08] <Gurkenglas> Because we can think of math-language as a UI to math, and it sure looks like there's a One True math-language. But since the argument wasn't supposed to be a lot of bits of evidence here it's not that important.
[14:09:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alright
[14:09:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, reading that "Pit of Success" post
[14:10:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's striking that neither the post itself nor any of the comments (that I've read so far) say anything like "and an example of a language or other system that has a pit of success is X"
[14:10:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> With other commenters going "ah yes, X, indeed, such a breeze to use, love it, use it all the time to do useful things"

[14:14:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Lots of back-and-forth that boils down to "I like this pit of failure more than that one"

[14:15:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: I feel like it's got to be some sort of commentary on something, if the best example we can come up with for a "pit of success" is a language that was *literally* designed for dumb people

[14:16:52] <PapuaHardyNet> what is a CT?
[14:16:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: What does that mean 
[14:16:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: category theory
[14:17:04] <dutchie> andy kelley has talked a bit about how he tried to make zig into "C but with a pit of success" with the defer and try keywords
[14:17:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> dutchie: Did he... succeed?
[14:17:28] <nshepperd> lol golang
[14:17:37] <dutchie> idk, probably still too soon to tell given the language isn't 1.0 yet
[14:17:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fair enough
[14:18:36] <dutchie> decisions like "no unused variables" have proved rather divisive
[14:18:38] <Gurkenglas> I used its technique of "when you're confused about a math things write down all the arrows you can find about it and see if the diagram has a name" and this showed me that the particular divide-and-conquer algorithm that my thesis was about was actually about group extensions.
[14:19:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: No I mean what does "to make my Bachelor's thesis deserve to exist" mean
[14:19:19] <PapuaHardyNet> I have no idea what the arrows actually mean - is that a category theory thing?
[14:19:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes
[14:19:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Just go read that one LW post about CT
[14:21:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok it was actually several posts
[14:21:59] <PapuaHardyNet> I'll put "category theory" in my to-read list, sure
[14:22:11] <Gurkenglas> It would have been merely "explain this algorithm at a level where a bachelor's student can understand it" and afaic i ended up understanding why it works more than the authors did. ...i probably should have contacted the authors about that.
[14:22:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> I personally was amused by the fact that the guy was like "I'm gonna explain category theory in this post sequence!!" and everyone was like "YES, we want that, tell us all about category theory and why it's awesome!!" and midway through the dude got discouraged and was like "this was a bad idea"
[14:23:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: So, this is a thesis for? what? a grad degree of some sort?
[14:23:23] <Gurkenglas> where understanding why it works is actually more important than the algorithm, because it's just a reduction between special cases of two unsolved problems, designed in hopes of generalization.
[14:24:07] <Gurkenglas> Obormot\Arcturus, I don't follow. A Bachelor's thesis is the article that one writes in order to finish one's Bachelor's degree.

[20:00:13] <zebrask> It's a bit of a puzzle to me that the information landscape for "fitness information" is basically a superfund site.
[20:01:50] <zebrask> It's undeniably useful information that people really want, but if there's some mechanism for signalling that the information is actually high-quality, I can't discern it.
[20:03:09] <zebrask> It seems like it's a subset of medical information, where we as a species have some vague idea of how things work in a general sense, but not even in the same ballpark as the way we know how like... a car works.
[20:03:13] <aweinstock> PapuaHardyNet: that's not python-specific, `man 2 fork` warns: "The child process is created with a single thread‚Äîthe one that called fork().  The entire virtual address space of the parent is replicated in the child, including the states of mutexes, condition variables, and other pthreads objects"
[20:04:40] <zebrask> So I dunno if this is a situation where we have so little information but so much demand for it that we collectively hallucinate a million fad diets or if there are some other dynamics there.
[20:06:34] <gwern> it's the hallucination. also, people don't believe in individual differences, so if you see a buff guy, it can't just be his genes, it has to be the virtues of hard work and a superior method
[20:07:10] <gwern> why does folk medicine exist, or witch doctors? very bad intuitions combined with social dynamics
[20:07:42] <zebrask> Well, the information landscape for medicine is also trash, but not as trash.
[20:08:18] <zebrask> I feel confident that I could find 10-15 books or podcasts on medical topics that have a consistent if noisy information signal.
[20:09:00] <zebrask> I'm not as confident about that for fitness. And in fitness circles, individual variation is totally taken as a given.
[20:09:51] <gwern> it's not, though, otherwise people wouldn't keep building entire worldviews on what worked for themselves or only following the programs of prestigious fitness experts
[20:10:15] <gwern> 'doctor, heal thyself' only works for things with zero individual variation and with ~100% success rates.
[20:10:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Man, the bugs you find just by documenting your own existing code...
[20:10:44] <zebrask> Plus it's not like methods don't work. You can turn a fat, out-of-shape person into something resembling a bodybuilder by following some fairly boring formulas for a while.
[20:11:33] <zebrask> gwern: I mean, they don't necessarily have stuff tailored to individuals, but every serious trainer you talk to will talk about genetics and "hard gainers" and such.
[20:12:11] <zebrask> I'm not talking about taking a random sampling of fitness information, that's obviously bad, but that's also bad for anything (Sturgeon's Law).

[20:14:57] <zebrask> I'm saying that usually each field has a few staid individuals making modest claims based on a broad knowledge of the applicable literature. The people closest to that that I've found in fitness circles seem to be mostly living on the edge between "has a bunch of unexamined premises / weird fads" and "does boring literature reviews."
[20:16:26] <zebrask> I've listened to a bunch of Revive Stronger podcasts, they seem to be generally in the "evidence-based fitness" camp, but 95% content is aimed at coaching bodybuilders.
[20:17:49] <zebrask> I think the reasoning being that coaching random beginners is almost trivial ‚Äî almost anything where you eat less food and exercise more will make someone lose weight, and beginning weightlifters put on muscle like it's going out of style.
[20:18:53] <zebrask> And bodybuilders are trying to eke out tiny improvements from a mostly optimized-physique, so you have to play around with a bunch of strategies to find something that works for each person.
[20:19:47] <zebrask> And the most infuriating thing about mid-to-high-end fitness is that it's nearly impossible to quantify. The most accurate measures of body fat are expensive and accurate to roughly "¬± the amount of weight you can lose in 2 weeks".
