[02:01:09] <kepstin> if for some reason you really need to run an external ffmpeg process as a decoder, the usual way to do that would be to have ffmpeg decode to raw pcm, and write to a pipe that's connected to your process rather than to a file.
[02:01:41] <kepstin> but yeah, your explanation is kind of confusing

[12:55:38] <kib> no i dont think so
[12:55:54] <kib> only if it involves copying stuff from your usb to your disk
[12:56:47] <GuiToris> I'd use an USB drive (system) and an external HDD
[12:57:32] <GuiToris> I know the system is slower, I guess it's because of the speed of the flash drives
[12:57:51] <kib> practically yes I think it will be slower. If we consider only cpu usage, in theory it shouldn't be but final result will need to be written to disk.
[12:57:57] <kib> GuiToris: exactly.
[12:58:09] <kib> I imagine ffmpeg will copy some data to the usb while transcoding
[12:58:32] <GuiToris> got it, thanks for your help :)

[14:20:02] <roxlu> Hi! I'm trying to look into hardware based encoding via VAAPI and wondering if someone ran into a similar situation where you have 2 GPUs (NVIDIA primary, Intel). I'm trying to get VAAPI working but it won't initialize: `(vaInitialize failed with error code -1 (unknown libva error),exit)`.

[15:34:41] <sfan5> not in the context of "standalone" decoding/encoding at least

[15:37:18] <roxlu> sfan5: ah! I didn't know that; any idea how I can configure this? I assume that I have to install the intel driver.. which worries me a bit as I'm not sure if `pacman -Si [intel-driver]` might force/enable the intel gpu as the default one

[22:29:59] <JEEB> CODECmadness: the only thing with AC-3 I noticed is that you have matrix encoding side data on the AVFrames at least (if that data is there)
[22:30:16] <JEEB> ah yes there was also AVDownmixInfo
[22:30:52] <JEEB> that has center_mix_level, surround_mix_level and lfe_mix_level
[22:32:26] <JEEB> unfortunately since there is no general "dump this side data into fields" framework set up yet, it isn't visible in ffprobe for whatever reason
[22:32:29] <JEEB> AV_FRAME_DATA_DOWNMIX_INFO
[22:33:30] <CODECmadness> Yep, but it only indicates that two items... and those are present even if DRC data is not there or not properly there, but BSID 6, Alternate sintax, is mandatory for a properly encoded AC3 with DRC
[22:34:58] <CODECmadness> so I was trying to at least reach that bit of info
[22:35:11] <JEEB> CODECmadness: if you do `ffprobe -of json -show_frames -select_streams a -i INPUT` you might even be able to see the side data in there, but alas no dumping implemented since there's no generic logic framework for it :<
[22:35:39] <JEEB> af_showinfo audio filter does have dumping of it implemented but that's not what is generally wanted
[22:35:51] <JEEB> af_ashowinfo I mean
[22:36:02] <JEEB> (probably "ashowinfo" in a filter chain)
[22:37:31] <CODECmadness> It only list side_data, which unfortunately is not enough to tell
[22:38:14] <JEEB> if you mean ffprobe, yes. since unfortunately very similar dumping right now has to be duplicated between (a)showinfo and ffprobe
[22:38:42] <JEEB> af_showinfo does log the actual values, though
[22:38:45] <JEEB> asdf
[22:38:48] <CODECmadness> I though maybe private data, some bitstream filter... but I'm not familiar with those so I don't know
[22:38:49] <JEEB> af_ashowinfo of course
[22:39:56] <JEEB> CODECmadness: if you are talking about the AVDownmixInfo stuff, it should be quite straightforward to dump it in ffprobe. just that for some reason that was skipped while af_ashowinfo has the same stuff logged
[22:42:10] <CODECmadness> Hm, not really sure about it. Where would the lt/rt or lo/ro downmix info would reside?
[22:43:00] <JEEB> they are exposed through that structure
[22:43:01] *** Joins: tlaxkit (~hexchat@170.253.35.150)
[22:43:19] <JEEB> because it's useful info but you don't want to expose codec internals to API users

[22:44:49] <JEEB> unfortunately the person who implemented it implemented the dumping in ashowinfo
[22:44:52] <JEEB> but not in ffprobe
[22:45:11] <JEEB> I really, really wish we had a generic framework for dumping this stuff into text
[22:45:24] <JEEB> so that people add this stuff to a single location and voila
[22:45:36] <JEEB> ashowinfo and ffprobe magically are able to dump it
[22:45:42] <JEEB> now it's dumbly separate
[22:47:42] <CODECmadness> reading ashowinfo doc it seems the values shown do not include what we're talking about either
[22:47:55] <JEEB> see what I linked
[22:48:29] <JEEB> that's the literal code in ashowinfo dumping the values off of the structure containing lt/lr | lo/ro modes and then the downmix values

[22:55:32] <CODECmadness> I've just tested with ffplay and ashowinfo, and it shows it while it plays. I suppose theres a way to get the same info but using ffmpeg and getting just text output?

[23:04:48] <JEEB> that is why I don't see it in the filter chain
[23:04:49] <JEEB> you did VF

[23:05:26] <JEEB> you actually see all of the created connections with -v verbose

[23:05:53] <JEEB> yup
[23:07:27] <CODECmadness> Now it works. It was the -vf problem you just pointed, using -af it shows what I need. A bit messy to parse but if that's what I have it'll have to do
[23:07:35] <JEEB> no
[23:07:48] <JEEB> is that the data you want is the main thing
[23:07:56] <JEEB> it's not hard to add dumping of it onto ffprobe :P

[23:29:11] <CODECmadness> Yep. Better.
[23:29:27] <JEEB> a) you want to see if the AVFrames that you get out of decoding contain these two side data. whether they exist in the decoded data or not is all you care.
[23:29:48] <JEEB> b) you want to see what is within those side data structures since you need to see f.ex. what the LFE mixing value is

[23:32:31] <JEEB> or well, how ashowinfo calls them
[23:32:36] <JEEB> that is why I double-checked by asking again
[23:33:40] <CODECmadness> It's my fault. I don't know enough about this. I just know what I want to find but know nothing about the innards of ffmpeg so I am frankly lost.
[23:34:25] <JEEB> http://up-cat.net/p/38e48eb1 <- in here, "AVMatrixEncoding" == "what ashowinfo calls 'matrix encoding'"
[23:34:51] <JEEB> this file I probed did not contain the downmix info so the side data is not there
[23:34:53] <CODECmadness> I just want to query a file and get an answer : here you have, matrix encoding is this [...] and preferred downmix is this [...]
[23:36:39] <JEEB> why I keep trying to verify what you need is because seeing whether that information is included in the stream is already implemented and coded
[23:36:47] <JEEB> but not showing the included the values
[23:37:03] <JEEB> so you can tell "I have matrix encoding and preferred downmix in this stream!"
[23:37:21] <JEEB> but you cannot tell "I have preferred downmix LFE levels of 0.71"
[23:37:28] <JEEB> does this make it more understandable?
[23:37:45] <CODECmadness> I'm afraid od saying yes, but... yes.
[23:39:21] <CODECmadness> so... as I can't get the levels 0.71 part, I¡d have enough if I could find if matrix and preferred are there.

[23:47:36] <CODECmadness> So, If I've understood you now, the side_data part ffprobe shows is what indicates the matrix and preferred downmix
[23:47:43] <CODECmadness> right?
[23:47:49] <JEEB> that the stream contains that data, yes
[23:47:58] <JEEB> if that data was not there, they are not there in the list

[23:49:41] <JEEB> ok, so what you are saying is that it is always exported even if no information is included... right
[23:49:44] <CODECmadness> As you see, the first tool indicates there's no matrix or preferred present, but ffprobe indicates there is.
[23:49:56] <CODECmadness> Yes, that's what it seems.
[23:51:22] <JEEB> ok, now it makes all a bit more sense
[23:51:23] <CODECmadness> So I can't use that as is not reliable enough. But if I use ffmpeg or ffplay, they show the bits that "prove" that the matrix is really there and the transferred is really there.
[23:51:45] <JEEB> I thought it would work like a lot of other stuff in FFmpeg, but apparently this was put there to be "always exposed"
[23:52:37] <CODECmadness> So that's where I didn't understood why yuou said what you said, and why insisted and to you it looked like I was just saying it again and again. I guess.
[23:53:12] <JEEB> because most side data in FFmpeg is added if the metadata is found
[23:53:21] <JEEB> and not added into the AVFrame if it does not exist
[23:55:07] <CODECmadness> So I can't use ffprobe for this then, no?
[23:55:38] <JEEB> not current master but if you need this info I can implement it. that's why I kept asking whether you needed the contents :)

[23:57:35] <CODECmadness> So, a whole mess.
[23:57:52] <JEEB> well, ffprobe does do that. it's just that I didn't expect that the side data would always be there
[23:58:02] <JEEB> the AVFrame can either have or not have the data
[23:58:05] <CODECmadness> Yep, that's what I mean.
