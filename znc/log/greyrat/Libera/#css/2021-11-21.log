[00:24:42] <carlino3> hi!
[00:24:45] <carlino3> https://jsfiddle.net/o2fah6zw/18/
[00:25:45] <carlino3> when there is not enough space, i want the blue div to be on top, is there any way to achieve this?
[00:27:46] <carlino3> or can i do this with grid layout?
[00:32:03] <hmw[at]> carlino3: Using @media with grid should be easy for that
[00:32:51] <hunboy> carlino3, https://jsfiddle.net/nksmto9L/
[00:32:59] <carlino3> hmw[at] if the parent container is the body yes, but it is not in the "real"code
[00:34:20] <carlino3> hmw[at] wait, that "max-width" is referring to the parent element or the screen?
[00:37:02] <hunboy> carlino3, update: https://jsfiddle.net/nksmto9L/1/
[00:39:04] <hassoon> carlino3: what's your definition of not having enough space ?
[00:39:32] <carlino3> i mean when the flex items overflows the parent width
[00:40:49] <hassoon> when did that happen ?
[00:41:30] <carlino3> resize the iframe and make it happen
[00:44:17] <hassoon> ah you did give the items min-width of 300px
[00:45:13] <hassoon> so whenever the parent width gets smaller than 300px it gets overflown by the flex items
[00:46:58] <hassoon> you can use a media query for that logic and change the flex items order when the window width is smaller than 300px; otherwise in real life use case, you should know how the width of the parent change with window sizes, and make the right media query for that accordingly
[00:49:03] <carlino3> someone should propose media queries for elements
[00:49:31] <hassoon> you can know how your elements resize with different window sizes
[00:50:14] *** Joins: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa)
[00:51:49] <hassoon> is that in a website ?
[00:52:07] <hassoon> if so, you can post the website url at whole, and we can look it up
[00:52:56] <carlino3> it is not on production so i can't
[00:53:19] <hassoon> meh share the whole webpage source code, that's doabl
[00:53:24] <hassoon> * doable
[00:53:37] <hassoon> e.g right click => view page source
[00:53:47] <carlino3> it is a react project
[00:54:01] <hassoon> and make the ressources inline, so the whole webpage becomes portable
[00:54:03] <hassoon> ah meh
[00:54:14] <hassoon> dunno anyway try it
[00:54:42] <hassoon> stackblitz does support react fiddles
[01:02:12] <hassoon> carlino3: and.. i assume in a react ecosystem, it's even easier to write some specific dynamic logic that deals with switching the flex items spots when they overflow the parent
[01:02:29] <hassoon> not telling you to do it in vanilla javascript yet..

[11:17:02] <lind{at}yahoo> https://jennifershareshuman.org is now mobile friendly, not perfect but at least useable! Comments very welcome. About 95% happy with HTML and 80% with CSS, deep analysis would be really cool: you can see the source directly on https://github.com/jlind0/jennifershareshuman (index.htm and Jen/index.htm are the two active and publicly accessible pages right now)
[11:18:52] <theskillwithin> your a life coach?
[11:41:17] <hmw[at]> lind{at}yahoo: ghostly meditating man looks really shoddy on full HD, get a higher res image. Tiktoks take quite a while to load, not sure if you can do anything about it besides not using tiktok for the videos. Clicking the hamburger menu again, while the menu is open should close it.
[11:42:05] <hmw[at]> "Basic Page Needs" is cute
[11:42:14] <lind{at}yahoo> well I could drop the tiktok's from 6 to 4. Long term I intend to use lazy loading from the TikTok (and other social feeds) to display data ondemand
[11:43:28] <hmw[at]> It still works, but there's a lot of network connections going etc. That page is probably not going to have an insane amount of traffic, so you could perhaps afford to host the videos on your own server
[11:43:41] <lind{at}yahoo> res is an issue, yes: I unfortunately am using stock images - and I don't have access to higher res on anything I particularly like. If you want to search around on bing or google images for relevant higher res images that would rock: but right now I do not have time to do that
[11:44:04] <lind{at}yahoo> the TikTok embeds are important for SEO and driving traffic to our social accounts.
[11:44:09] <hmw[at]> lind{at}yahoo: You may perhaps commission the image to an artist
[11:44:23] <lind{at}yahoo> I would love to do that, no budget for that at the moment
[11:44:30] <hmw[at]> classic
[11:44:34] <lind{at}yahoo> the logo is transitional as well
[11:46:17] <lind{at}yahoo> we're an unfunded startup. Jen makes about $60k a year and is a single mom. I have received 5 pay checks over the past 5 years for a total of $30k, the last 3 coming over the last 6 weeks and accounting for nearly $20k of that. Medium term (January) I should be able to assign about $3-5k to graphic design... but for now free is the only option on that regard
[11:46:34] <hmw[at]> lind{at}yahoo: You want to up the quality of that image and perhaps layout/logo etc, in order to project more professionalism. I think that is pretty important.
[11:47:21] <hmw[at]> otoh cudos for hand crafting the source
[11:48:16] <lind{at}yahoo> hmw[at]: as I said suggestions would be appreciated, I can make very quick color scheme fixes, some layout changes if you tell me what to do. I can swap out graphics with free ones. If you can find a logo base that is higher res and still fits with the jist of the branding we're going for I can quickly modify the logo in Publisher (although not easily give it the transparent background I would really like). I would be happy to credit you
[11:48:16] <lind{at}yahoo> and link to your portfolio in the footer
[11:49:21] <lind{at}yahoo> we do have a massive event in the works http://mentalhealth.event.jennifershareshuman.org with 110 RSVP's including DoD heavy weights (some active/retired USAF/USSF Flag officers actually) and industry titans including the Chief Marketing Officer of Omega SA
[11:51:46] <hmw[at]> lind{at}yahoo: I am not very good at the artist aspect of design, so I often use Google image search to get ideas or find assets I can use directly. Looking closely at pages that have a flaire I like to copy also can help with finding all the little issues on the page I am working in.
[11:51:49] <hmw[at]> on*
[11:52:14] <hmw[at]> You may also ask in #design
[11:52:19] <lind{at}yahoo> I am mostly happy with layout at this stage of the game, color scheme would be nice. I can change color scheme very quickly
[11:52:36] <hmw[at]> I'd hope so, if you're using CSS :)
[11:52:41] <lind{at}yahoo> #design hates me, I tried to start a pro-bono design competition for UN CYBERCOM

[11:53:19] <lind{at}yahoo> hmw[at]: well its not completely perfect... my css is a little messy.... but its good enough that I can make the changes pretty quickly with find/replace in visual sutdio code
[11:53:58] <lind{at}yahoo> I don't have time to review style guides right now.... I have a meeting with Apple in 6.5hrs that I have about 2-3hrs of writing to prepare for...
[11:54:04] <hmw[at]> lind{at}yahoo: It is pretty hard to find volunteers. The more one asks, the more people might feel offput by it. Sad truth
[11:54:18] <hmw[at]> lind{at}yahoo: Don't complain, bookmark
[11:54:21] <lind{at}yahoo> this is good enough for beta 1.... I would like to get the color scheme to RC tonight... images would be bonus
[11:54:35] <hmw[at]> There's color scheme generators online too
[11:54:56] <lind{at}yahoo> hmw[at]: sorry if that came out wrong: I have not clicked the links but by the titles they sound interesting, useful and applicable
[11:55:16] <hmw[at]> I think there's a good chance, you'll benefit from those 2 articles. One deals with colors too.
[11:55:48] <hmw[at]> Good luck! I'll be afk
[11:56:10] <lind{at}yahoo> I have an eye for design, I am horrible at implementing them. Honestly until recently, even though I had a featured site on Yahoo! in 1995 and was a GeoCities Community Leader from 1996-1999: I was a total pretender at front end, and still would not consider myself a web designer
[11:56:53] <hmw[at]> lind{at}yahoo: Good start. Most "web designers" aren't good, except with Photoshop perhaps.

[12:39:01] <wannakiss> the logo makes little sense, but reminds me of patients at the ER with those heart monitor electrodes attached to them
[12:39:04] <lind{at}yahoo> regardless that is not being addressed tonight, my plan is to eventually put a div "popup hover" over the menu items to better present the info

[12:59:44] <lind{at}yahoo> theskillwithin: that should point directly to the wiki, which is serving as our quick and dirty front page at the moment, there is a known bug with some preview packages that it will redirect to the repo if you click the image. if you browse directly to the url it will redirect appropriately

[13:47:43] <theskillwithin> didn't have to say ur old, not even my parents use yahoo email anymore
[13:50:20] <lind{at}yahoo> it forwards to my O365 E3 acct, which I pay Yahoo! $13/yr to do that forward btw (so far jason.lind@gmail.com forwards without payment) - do you have any concept of the power of saying "lind@yahoo.com lima-indigo-nancy-delta" and EVERYONE regardless of dialect can send me an email and like 85% have it memorized instantly?
[13:52:05] <lind{at}yahoo> O365 manages the spam very well, I do have spam turned on on the yahoo! side as well - there is about a 2% false positive on that side that requires me to daily check my Yahoo! spam folder to make sure I have not missed anything relevant. between my 30-some-odd email addresses, distribution lists and aliases I receive upwards of 5000 emails a day of which around 50 make it into my focused inbox

[13:58:01] <lind{at}yahoo> the only reason I have that email is because I was an equity compensated Community Leader of /Hollywood for GeoCities in 1996 which was acquired by Yahoo! for $3bn in stock in 1999 and they used their account system as the basis for Yahoo! accounts, including email

[15:10:20] <lind{at}yahoo> as to the cert issue: because I am using default GoDaddy nameserves, I have to install a premium cert through godaddy, there is no server available to utilize installation of a free cert. Certs like that start at $300/yr for a domain for a wildcard. You want to fund that to simply serve a PDF over SSL that has zero secure information either on the send or receive side? I sure as shit do not
[15:11:19] <hassoon> theskillwithin: ah you said you can and obviously know how to do it,   nvm
[15:11:52] <hassoon> lind{at}yahoo: is that your own firm or you're just an employee ?
[15:12:11] <lind{at}yahoo> seriously: if you think HTTPS is mandatory in this situation you have no idea what you are talking about. The only benefit to the end user in this case is obfuscating tracking, and even then your VPN provider or ISP has access to that data
