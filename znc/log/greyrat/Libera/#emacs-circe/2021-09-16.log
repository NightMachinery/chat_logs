[13:34:59] <ecraven> hm.. does circe support anything like org-mode links? something I could use to send a link to a specific line in a file over IRC, and that a remote emacs could then interpret and show as a link?
[13:35:38] <wasamasa> it has built-in link types for emacs functions and stuff
[13:35:48] <wasamasa> if both sides make one for org stuff or whatever, that would work
