[13:39:13] <Whistler> kilobug: well that might be ideal but I'm not sure if those cases are actually covered by copyright law. the issue is someone else in my company gave me a copy of their modified version of GPL'ed software and explicitly said that they won't provide the source code.
[13:40:30] <Whistler> I don't think I'll try to get it though as otherwise I might be kicked out of the company, just curious whether this is actually in violation or not.
[13:42:07] <DiffieHellman> The "intention" of the GPL within companies is more or less to meant to apply to company systems etc.
[13:42:20] <Whistler> the  source code to the linux kernel used in our servers is also NOT available to employees.
[13:42:26] <Whistler> unless you are in charge of the development.
[13:43:29] <DiffieHellman> Unless they're giving you binaries of the kernel, Linux, the GPL doesn't really apply.

[13:43:39] <kilobug> Whistler: if it runs on company servers and you're only granted access to the company server, you're not really "given a copy" so GPL doesn't apply (AGPL would be a different issue); I guess it depends what you mean with "gave me a copy"
