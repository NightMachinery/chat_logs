[00:01:34] <mouseghost> currently, during the time of interest, i send the request and get the response like 45 seconds later :V
[00:02:15] <netbsduser`> banna: you're surely right
[00:02:51] <Brekkjern> mouseghost: You sure the problem is IIS? :P
[00:02:58] <mouseghost> Brekkjern, what else would it be?
[00:02:59] <netbsduser`> i had an interesting experience reading an old manual Apple wrote on the writing of good daemons. it urged against using Mach-based IPC mechanisms because of the "complication" of the bootstrap namespace hierarchy
[00:03:20] <Brekkjern> mouseghost: Are you running IIS on an abacus or something?
[00:03:25] <mouseghost> im not running it :P
[00:03:50] <mouseghost> my logic is that IIS gets flooded with requests at some time and then takes long time to respond...
[00:03:53] <netbsduser`> it urged unix domain sockets instead. Apple have done an about-turn on this and now advocate XPC, a system based on mach ports. the reason? the engineers who held those earlier views are gone. there is a totally different understanding of their own OS now
[00:04:57] <Brekkjern> mouseghost: Despite what the FOSS sector believes, IIS is a capable webserver if not configured completely wrong. I'd still pick nginx or something over it, but what you are seeing is highly abnormal.
[00:05:35] <varjag> the first decade of iis experience kinda soured it for everyone
[00:05:36] <mouseghost> well, it usually responds in a few hundred milliseconds. but not at that specific time
[00:05:46] *** Quits: spacebyte (~spacebyte@87.196.80.57) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[00:05:54] <mouseghost> perhaps right, maybe it is not IIS but the database or something there
[00:06:23] <mouseghost> but that sounds rather nonsensical as well, unless the app is written poorly..?
[00:06:38] <Brekkjern> Something is accepting your TCP session and presumably handling TLS, so that would be IIS. Slow responses like that is probably some application behind IIS being shit
[00:07:02] *** Joins: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech)
[00:07:02] <Brekkjern> It's not impossible that IIS is the culprit, but I kinda doubt it's the root cause.
[00:07:18] <mouseghost> it doesnt really go over 300 or something requests in that time... and 45 seconds seem a bit much... though i once got 8 seconds, once 20 seconds, now 40 seconds of that delay
[00:07:51] <mouseghost> yeah i guess if it wasnt accepted then my local thing would say it timed out
[00:07:53] <mouseghost> i suppose
[00:08:18] <Brekkjern> Sounds more like whatever application behind IIS is rather slow when you hit some bottleneck. Wether that is CPU, IO or something else is difficult to know without access to the server.
[00:08:51] <mouseghost> yeah that sounds logical... thanks meow

[05:28:37] <rtpg> been working on trying to improve performance on Django templates and just kind of staring at perf graphs and thinking "what am I even doing.... using interpreted languages was a mistake"
[05:29:13] <rtpg> I don't seriously think that but I am having a bit of an existential crisis at how many orders of magnitude slower it is to have stuff be all pure python.
[05:29:46] <dsc_> jinja2 has a compiler and all, probably the same with django templates
[05:36:30] <rtpg> Jinja has a compiler?  I guess not built into the project, didn't see anything on there. DDG ain't helping me much...
[05:36:35] <wrl> rtpg: doesn't django also "cache" compiled templates?
[05:37:20] <rtpg> Django builds an AST, and caches that. So you're saving on parsing. but you're still basically paying for lots of function calls and creating and tearing down loads of contexts to do stuff
[05:37:30] <wrl> yeahhh
[05:37:33] <wrl> ok that makes sense
[05:37:52] <wrl> that's obnoxious :/
[05:38:15] <rtpg> my belief is that by doing a "build up a big function with exec and trying to inline stuff/use if/elif/else" could make stuff at least twice as fast, so I'mtrying to prototype that (working on some stuff)
[05:38:55] <rtpg> but it's tough and my spaghetti code is hard to follow, so it's buggy. Hence me getting a bit demotivated
[05:39:11] <wrl> imo that'd be best written in a kind of functional style
[05:39:12] <wrl> y'know?

[07:40:48] <rtpg> What are the cool hip programming languages that interface well with DBs nowadays? Working on a tiny web-scraping thing and kinda tempted to try out a new language
[07:41:01] <Ori_B> SQL? </snark>
[07:41:28] <pnoud> For real though, SQL seems to be getting a lot of attention recently.
[07:42:11] <rtpg> lol, yeah I'm gonna like... write stuff out to a DB. Just more like for the other logic wanted to try a thing (counterexample is like... C is not so fun with dealing with arbitrary bags of data I imagine)
[07:42:24] <Ori_B> yeah. I also tend to prefer writing sql directly over using deep ORMs.
[07:42:32] <Ori_B> that said, LINQ in C# seems nifty.
[07:42:58] <Ori_B> never really wrote much of it though, since I tend to not work near windows
[07:43:04] <rtpg> I really wish there would be somebody who could write a ... better SQL interface. Every SQL builder lib I see is like really glorified string concatenation, making it hard for me to get the point of it realy
[07:43:06] <pnoud> You could try something like PostgREST and just make API calls but you'd be implementing the API in... SQL.
[07:43:45] <Ori_B> rtpg: linq :)
[07:44:04] <pnoud> I actually really like PostgREST and used it on a couple toy projects but I've never had the balls to use it in prod.

[07:45:26] <pnoud> Ori_B: how does Linq differ from an ORM?
[07:45:28] <Ori_B> ^-- for example.
[07:46:06] <pnoud> Huh, does it actually convert that into a query or do something awful like fetch the result set and then re-filter?
[07:46:20] <Ori_B> by the way, that example is copied from the MS docs, and it's actually querying a list of numbers, and not a database.
[07:46:37] <Ori_B> but you can *also* query databases with it.
[07:46:37] <pnoud> Where did the list of numbers come from?
[07:46:46] <Ori_B> List<int> numbers = new List<int>() { 5, 4, 1, 3, 9, 8, 6, 7, 2, 0 };
[07:46:48] <pnoud> Oh.  Ok, so if you query a database how does that work?
[07:47:31] <Ori_B> IIRC, there are interfaces that your data types implement.
[07:47:38] <Ori_B> and those could build queries.
[07:47:52] <pnoud> Most developers seem to think SQL is some kind of antequated relic but as a data person I kinda think *programming languages* are the antequated relics.  What exactly is anyone doing that isn't ultimately CRUD?
[07:47:56] <Ori_B> so, you'd use LINQ with an ORM.
[07:48:12] <Ori_B> but, again, I'm *not* a MS developer.
[07:48:22] <pnoud> Ori_B: congratulations
[07:48:45] <Ori_B> so, this is basically me watching from a distance.
[07:49:18] <pnoud> I wondered what the smell was.
[07:50:01] <pnoud> But for real what *is* Linq?  Microsoft for all their faults actually does some interesting work.  This is some kind of query language on top of an ORM?
[07:50:19] <pnoud> Does it ultimately compile to SQL through an ORM?
[07:50:58] <pnoud> I kinda wonder how things like the Redshift Data API work.
[07:51:14] *** Joins: LordRishav (~LordRisha@user/lordrishav)
[07:51:24] <pnoud> Do they have a PostgREST layer that compiles to SQL or do they directly execute queries somehow?
[07:51:29] <rtpg> I think it's basically the "logical extension" of list comprehensions and the like
[07:52:12] <pnoud> rtpg: but it sounds like it still does the execution locally, rather than compiling down to SQL and letting the databse do the work?
[07:52:14] <rtpg> and like with clojure, doing the thing of building up query objects that hold the functions so that then they can be processed nicely
[07:53:38] <pnoud> Huh, looks like RDS AUrora has a data API too.  No idea how that works.
[07:54:52] <pnoud> rtpg: but like, if you build up those query objects to return one row that is identified by an index, does the db just return that or do you send a terabyte of data across the wire and let some application server grind it up?
[07:55:31] <cb> linq is half query builder-in-language constructs
[07:55:44] <pnoud> That's pretty cool then.
[07:56:03] <cb> the other half "we're adding functional programming tools like map and filter to .net and calling them by their SQL names so midwesterners won't freak out"
[07:56:16] <Ori_B> it would be pretty fucking insane to integrate queries into the langauge, provide interfaces suitable to build an ORM, and then force the database to ship all the data over the wire.
[07:56:20] <pnoud> cb: I'm not sure if I should be offended.
[07:56:45] <cb> microsoft got corn-fed middle america to adopt functional programming techniques so i ain't mad
[07:56:51] <pnoud> Speaking of query building: based only on a single POC I have been _very_ impressed by Looker's query building.
[07:57:14] <pnoud> It absolutely blows my mind that all data tools don't just do that, or that there isn't some open source thing that can do it.
[07:57:48] <pnoud> cb: That's hilarious because I have a coworker from Michigan who wont shut up about functional programming.
[07:58:11] <pnoud> I wondered what his deal was.  He still hasn't tried to get me to install Windows.  I didn't think to ask what kind of laptop he has.
[08:01:32] <pnoud> Assuming a normalized schema with foreign keys is there a reason that Postgres (or any RDBMS) can't just infer the join conditions based on a set of columns and filters?
[08:04:25] <Ori_B> off to bed.

[11:57:01] <enterprisey> "seen domain" is interesting, I'd like to hear about how the site's experience with it is
[11:57:06] <enterprisey> I'm leaning towards something similar for Wikipedia where users enter sources
[11:57:16] <pnoud> Is there a concept of hidden submissions?  Something like a soft delete?  Maybe it could be submitted as such and then "blessed" by a trusted user?

[12:09:41] <riv> quality seems to be dropping a little

[12:10:41] <gerikson> I flag liberally
[12:10:58] <riv> it's awkward to tell someone i guess, and it's subjective too, but nothing seemed to have guided them yet
[12:15:55] <enterprisey> From my point of view as an occasional drive-by user and someone not too deeply involved in the site (thus I could be wrong), the site has a long ways to go to get out from under HN's shadow, so its perception as "HN repost zone" is gonna put a ceiling on post quality
[12:19:40] <riv> yeah the HN repost phenomenon is annoying too...
[12:19:51] <riv> because you don't want to just block anything that's on HN
[12:20:02] <gerikson> less than 5% of links submitted to HN are posted here
[12:20:22] <gerikson> or rather are shared between HN and Lobsters
[12:20:26] <pnoud> You mean in general?  Why can't a "better" post be submitted to lobste.rs instead of HN?
[12:20:29] <riv> that's a really low number!

[16:12:09] <cepheus> English is particularly bad about this for numerous different reasons; while French and Spanish in particular are subject to the same level of pressure due to the impact of imperialism and globalisation meaning a lot of people adopt it as a second language, the romance languages are largely inherited from Latin with some small amount of cross polination whereas English in it's modern form really came about by fusing the heavily germanic Old English with...
[16:12:14] <cepheus> ... Old French (with some influence of Old Norse)

[22:26:34] <drobilla> Germany, my most likely necessary travel target, has a sort of opposite policy where a mix of AZ and an mRNA is considered fully vaccinated, but two mRNAs is /not/

[22:29:45] <Helmholtz> Is it the *culture* in KDE-land, that every app depends on every K_version_of_stuff?
[22:31:04] <_axx> drobilla i have to correct you there, in Germany, two mRNA doses are the standard way of doing it and only people that got there first AZ shot, will get one of the mRNA ones after that
[22:31:44] <drobilla> _axx: You sure?  I'm specifically talking about mixing /two different brands/ of mRNA ones
[22:31:53] <kline> Helmholtz, its a desktop environment, so yes, its designed as a coherent package of related and cooperating programs
[22:32:39] <_axx> drobilla yes, as long as you have two doses of anything you're fully vaxxed
[22:32:43] <_axx> (german here)
[22:33:15] <_axx> I'm not sure how it works for travelers and how they can confirm that they're fully vaccinated
[22:33:17] <Helmholtz> kline, well how come we can use Xfce or GNOME apps in most of DEs outthere?
[22:33:18] <kline> the idea is that KDE software should be able to interoperate to a high standard that allows it to compete with other integrated tools like microsofts office/desktop suite where i can, for example, send an email to automatically schedule a meeting that will cue skype into a teleconference where everyone can collaborate on a single word document
[22:33:32] <Helmholtz> But god forbid it you want a KDE app...you have to bring along the whole Kdeps
[22:34:01] <kline> i mean, gnome software definitely brings vast amounts of gtk dependencies with it
[22:34:25] <kline> i only guess that because gnome is more common, you're less likely to see it since itll have been installed up-front

[23:16:18] <Helmholtz> I've seen a couple of famous people (in FOSS world) post their blog on lobsters but not on HN
[23:16:22] <Helmholtz> idk why
[23:18:02] <cferry> I am assuming HN's orientation is 60% tech, 40% entrepreneurship, while Lobsters may be 70% tech, 30% enterpreneurship?
[23:18:45] <drobilla> Yeah, that's the why.  I don't imagine I'd ever post anything I'm up to on HN
[23:18:54] <meff[m]> I think it's also parts of the programming world. Lobsters has more articles about OS and crypto for example, so if you're active in those fields, it might make more sense to post on Lobsters for more focus/quality exposure.
[23:18:59] <pushcx> I delete entrepreneurship stories, hopefully it's closer to a rounding error.

[23:25:27] <drobilla> "Just have a go" seconded, but that's always how I do things.  People seem to like "Effective Modern C++" though

[23:26:06] <drobilla> Depending on the work culture that might not even be considered modern

[23:28:26] <drobilla> Language fanboys in general can be trouble in my experience, assuming your goal is to actually get shit done...
[23:29:13] <drobilla> pre-C++11 was an absolute nightmare, but everything past that is pretty unimportant
[23:30:08] <indigo> Also try your hardest not to use boost
[23:30:22] <drobilla> Particularly bad right now because modules aren't really implemented at all, but the standard has them, so there's a bunch of people trying to instantly modulize things for some damned reason
[23:30:28] <drobilla> The committee seriously needs to stop doing that shit
[23:31:11] <c355e3b> From what I can see it’s mostly using the memory management stuff and unique pointer

[23:31:19] <c355e3b> Which I hate
[23:31:57] <drobilla> Yeah, that's the big one.  Raw pointers and new/delete are more or less universally considered bad except in special circumstances.  unique_ptr that shit as indigo says :)

[23:33:23] <drobilla> All aboard the good (enough) ship Meson!
[23:33:57] <kline> tbh i think the make model is good enough
[23:34:01] <drobilla> (IDE support isn't quite there yet, though, which I think is where cmake gets its traction)
[23:34:15] <kline> expand it so that you can talk about multiple outputs being generated by the same rule
[23:34:23] <kline> and unfuck the unsearchable syntax

[23:35:50] <drobilla> I didn't think I especially cared about constant per-build overhead, but since switching I find things like doing big exec rebases to run tests or whatever quite a lot more pleasant.  It's so quick
