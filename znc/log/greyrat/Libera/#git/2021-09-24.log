[00:14:48] <sqz1> hi all. I've commited something (foo) in new feature-branch, pushed it to the main repository (gitlab). Turns out the mainbranch changed in the meanwhile. How can I pull the mainbranch into the feature-branch, so that the last commit (foo) becomes the last commit? (instead of the 'Merging branch ...'-commit(s)) ?
[00:15:47] <sqz1> I was thinking of cherrypicking that commit to a slightly similar-named (new) branch...but I was curious if there's a way of doing all this in the same feature-branch

[00:29:42] <sqz1> @tang^ do you think `git pull --rebase` equals `git fetch && git rebase --root=main` ?
[00:30:19] <sqz1> `--root main` that is
[00:30:24] <tang^> roughly...
[00:30:37] <tang^> assuming you're pulling from main
[00:31:50] <sqz1> I was on the feature branch..something like `repo.git:feature/foo $ git pull origin main --rebase` worked like a charm

[10:32:39] <dodobrain> are the commit time and author time the only times i can extract out of a repository ?
[10:33:14] <dodobrain> does git store the commandline or args used somewhere in its history as well?
[10:33:37] <osse> yes and no, respectively
[10:34:10] <osse> services like github/gitlab  have addition logs for who pushed what and stuff
[10:34:14] <osse> but that's not part of git itself'
[10:34:25] <dodobrain> umm.. so short of having a central repo that keeps state outside/beyond the git repo i cannot find out when commits were pushed/edited ?

[10:45:27] <dodobrain> i told them its a waste of time and nothing useful is to be gained, but i'm being asked and paid to waste my time on this
[10:45:39] <dodobrain> the problem is that its eating time away from my other stuff grr

[15:13:16] <euouae> Hello, I have two commits A followed by B in branch X and now I want to create a branch Y and move commit A to Y (removing it from X). How can I do this?
[15:15:40] <euouae> I guess I could branch out of X, revert B, and switch to X and rebase deleting A
[15:18:08] <mspe> I think I would checkout on commit before A, cherry-pick B, then set Y branch on this cherry-picked commit
[15:18:09] <gnoo> euouae: git branch Y A ; git rebase -i HEAD~10 and drop the A commit

[17:59:13] <euouae> Guest60 if you want to compromise your security (only a little bit) you can use https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.10.0.windows.1 for example
[17:59:51] <euouae> Guest60 go for the PortableGit link; use 32bit or 64bit as you need
[18:01:18] <Guest60> Thanks!  Unfortunately, not set up to build it so the prebuild would be better in my case unless no alternative (then I'd have to get instructions on how - I do know how to program and have dev studio but no nothing about building git).

[18:05:35] <euouae> another| First link is what the state of my repo is. Second link is the error I get after running rebase
[18:05:35] <Guest60> Understood.  Perhaps an anti-virus scan enough?  I do not have any files I'd be downloading or uploading that would be a security risk in and of themselves.
[18:05:55] <euouae> another| my problem is that I want to squash all the commits into 1 and then force-push upstream
[18:06:23] <euouae> Guest60 an AV scan yes, will be a good first step.

[18:22:26] <Guest60> I may have to wait to do all this and DL from my son's cell phone's browser.  Just trying to find a more permanent solution that would work on my own machine
[18:23:14] <Guest60> Unless you happen to know of a newer browser that runs on XP than K-Meleon
[18:25:42] <another|> You run XP? Connected to the internet? ... I hope you know what you're doing
[18:25:51] <Guest60> Yes
[18:26:08] <another|> anyway, see above
[18:26:37] <Guest60> Thanks
[18:26:45] <Guest60> Will try that

[18:30:05] <euouae> If you're running XP because the machine is old, I recommend that you install lubuntu instead. https://lubuntu.net/
[18:30:35] <euouae> It's a popular Linux distribution for low-power computers. You get 2021 security.
[18:30:38] <jsmooth> git status shows fine, but I still cannot get my files to GitHUb
[18:30:44] <jsmooth> It says everything is up to date
[18:31:02] <euouae> jsmooth is this your first time trying to do something like this or have you interacted with github before?
[18:31:19] <euouae> jsmooth you could describe your problem in detail so that we can have a better idea of what to suggest

As for XP, several reasons (old machine being just one), but I'll try that Linux OS you suggested, thank you.  I used to use Unix/Linux (Solaris, Hpux, etc.) at work, so probably a good choice for me.

[20:30:30] <euouae> Hello I have X and origin/X and project/X where I do a PR. The maintainers ask me to perform changes to my commit, but because they want a clean history for 'project', they want me to force-push in origin/X.
[20:30:59] <euouae> However, this is not a good workflow for me, as I'd like to have the changes that lead up to whatever. How should I structure my repo to have all my changes and end up with a PR that only have 1 commit?
[20:31:48] <euouae> e.g. I commit `Hello world` and maintainers complain I forgot the period, so I force-push `Hello world.`, but I'd like to have both commits /somewhere/ in my GH repo and locally
[20:32:06] <rewt> if you want your branch to have all commits, but they want a branch with only 1 commit, they need to be different branches
[20:32:26] <rewt> make a new branch where the current branch is, and squash the new branch, and PR that
[20:32:31] <euouae> rewt makes sense, and if Y has 1 commit and X all of them, how do I keep Y up to date?

[21:29:00] <osse> e.g. git config diff.ignoreSubmodules true
[21:29:35] <Swahili> osse: thanks for looking! when a repo has a submodule, we start by: git submodule update --init --recursive
[21:30:05] <Swahili> so that'd get me the head commit and then if I want to cd into it and change to another commit, I can then do from root git submodule update --remote --merge
[21:30:09] *** Joins: meator (~meator@user/meator)
[21:30:19] <Swahili> in that case then I commit the changes locally by git add theSubModule
[21:30:23] <Swahili> does this sound correct?
[21:30:37] <osse> yes
