[00:19:27] <crowbar> is there an org function that takes me directly from an org buffer to a rendered html buffer?  Seems like there might be something that previews html rendered directly/live instead of M-x org-html-export-as-html followed by M-x w3m-buffer after each update.
[00:22:26] <crowbar> or M-x shr-render-buffer which looks even nicer
[00:25:12] <crowbar> found it!  installed org-preview-html and it's exactly what I want.

[11:56:08] <thornAvery> hello, im using org-roam and wondered if theres an easy way to open a node, from a list of every node with a matching #:filetag
[12:09:28] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[12:11:16] <konubinix> thornAvery: Do you mean like org-roam-node-find but showing only the subset of nodes matching some :filetag query?
[12:13:51] <thornAvery> i managed to get something like that by setting org-roam-node-display-template, so i can mostly do it now, if you have a better way id love to hear it though
[12:15:10] <konubinix> If that's so, I don't know of any OOTB solution, but for org-roam-node-find takes a filter-fn, you can craft a command to do that
[12:15:34] <konubinix> With org-roam-node-tags, you can extract the tagd
[12:16:38] <thornAvery> oh ill take a look at that, thank you :)
[12:21:02] <konubinix> Something like this
[12:21:09] <konubinix> no results to fetch
[12:21:43] <konubinix> It does not work as is though. I think it needs fixing,but you get the idea
[12:22:26] <konubinix> I don't have time here to give you the working answer, so i leave you with this suggestion

[21:41:57] <sammelweis> What's a good way to get notifications for org encoded todo items on an android (lineageos) phone?  I tried orgzly but: I can only make it beep once at exactly at deadline; can't notify of appointments ahead of time; can't repeat notifications until acknowledged; so can't make it function enough to rely on.

[22:12:33] <tyson2> sammelweis: I haven't tried this, but org-trello allows for sharing org headlines with trello, I think that Trello on Android allows for a variety of notifications, and I think deadlines are translated to trello
[22:13:01] <tyson2> other advantage is allows sharing of org items with those who don't use org-mode
[22:13:42] <tyson2> I have tried org-trello, but not for notifications.  Requires some setup but is a useful tool
[22:20:20] <sammelweis> tyson2: thanks, looked into that...  wouldn't really work for me as among other things it's an internet-based service, I definitely need notifications to work without internet access
