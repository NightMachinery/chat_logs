[02:15:43] <evilgohan2> ThePendulum: there's a not-small segment of people who do believe vaccines to be "the mark of the beast". Likewise, amongst Americans, one of the groups who have consistently reported as least likely to get vaccinated are White, Evangelical

[02:26:31] <evilgohan2> I mean, Dragon Ball Z and Pokemon (picking the largest franchises to leave Japan the past 30 years) are likely no different in that regard than Marvel and DC properties.
[02:26:43] <skye0> avatar reminds me of gender issues - i hated that i would just be seen to be more like aang with regards to gender. plus i prefer more modern or futuristic stuff but asian historical stuff interests me more than european historical stuff generally. heard good things about avatar though
[02:26:45] <evilgohan2> The only difference is the nation of origin and the art styles.
[02:27:03] <evilgohan2> Oh, not Avatar The Last Airbender, I meant Avatar the 2009 film.
[02:27:16] <skye0> dbz i can sort of get into but i'm somewhat still hesitant about it. i don't know if i want to get into any shows or stuff
[02:27:25] <ThePendulum> don't they have tail sex organs, guess that's also quite progressive
[02:27:30] <skye0> it already took me some effort to scrape all the winx club stuff i wanted to watch and keep
[02:27:54] <evilgohan2> ThePendulum: err... no, and now I have questions I don't want the answers to.
[02:28:00] <ThePendulum> really puts a different twist on "the last air bender" hm
[02:28:32] <ThePendulum> evilgohan2: I mean granted it's been 11 years, but I thought there was a sex scene where their tails intertwined?
[02:28:41] <ThePendulum> I may have to forward your questions to my parents
[02:29:07] <ThePendulum> okay apparently it's some kind of platonic bond https://james-camerons-avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Tsaheylu
[02:29:08] <skye0> i have elite dangerous too but i've mostly ben persuaded to buy and play it for the FPS expansion, Odyssey. i like how well it simulates space physics but i find the whole space travel thing tedious now
[02:29:15] <ThePendulum> "The Na'vi connect their queues during mating to create a strong, emotional, and lifelong bond"
[02:29:20] <ThePendulum> no it's not I fucking knew it
[02:29:31] <ThePendulum> they're tail fuckers they are
[02:29:34] <seku> now that was a silly movie
[02:30:04] <seku> it was nice graphically wise, but intelligence wise it felt insulting
[02:30:40] <evilgohan2> ThePendulum: It was their hair
[02:30:40] <ThePendulum> I think at the time most people went because it was one of the first big 3D movies
[02:30:57] <evilgohan2> ThePendulum: literally why everyone had ponytails.
[02:30:59] <seku> yah, but it was better in 2D
[02:31:18] <ThePendulum> evilgohan2: it's a body part with nerves in it though
[02:31:19] <evilgohan2> seku: Going to disagree. 3D made that movie worth it, though I don't mind it in 2D.
[02:31:24] <ThePendulum> more like a tail attached to their head than hair
[02:31:31] <seku> back then projectors couldnt do the 3D necessary light output to make it shine
[02:31:34] <seku> imho
[02:31:36] <ThePendulum> they basically braid their head tails
[02:31:47] <ThePendulum> "On the Na'vi, it is similar in appearance to long braided human hair, but is in fact an extension of the nervous system"
[02:31:53] <evilgohan2> They did have distinct tails though didn't they?
[02:32:16] <evilgohan2> ThePendulum: Have you ever played anything like Witcher 3?
[02:32:17] <ThePendulum> apparently they have both
[02:32:25] <evilgohan2> sorry, not ThePendulum. Meant skrzyp
[02:32:26] <evilgohan2> grah
[02:32:28] <evilgohan2> damn it mirc
[02:32:30] <evilgohan2> skye0 ^^
[02:32:34] <ThePendulum> well feel free to ask me
[02:32:36] <skye0> hmm?
[02:32:42] <evilgohan2> Have you ever played anything like Witcher 3?
[02:32:45] <skye0> would envy characters in witcher 3
[02:32:59] <evilgohan2> I gotta say, I definitely would not envy _anyone_ in Witcher 3.
[02:33:00] <skye0> won't touch games like borderlands, mass effect, life is strange precisely because i envy the characters
[02:33:15] <evilgohan2> Okay, Mass Effect is my stan so I won't argue that.
[02:33:22] <ThePendulum> I think skye needs a game where every character is played by and modeled after me, to completely erradicate all chances of envy
[02:33:24] <seku> skye0: don't watch the Expanse then :)
[02:33:25] <skye0> i envy the hot women in the witcher series. those sex scenes are hot but would make me a bit sad too
[02:33:44] <evilgohan2> what about Alien: Isolation?
[02:34:02] <skye0> evilgohan2 horror games aren't for me
[02:34:33] <skye0> seku half the reason i can't get into anything now is because of envy for women. hell, i can't even listen to music i've never heard of before on the damn radio or even look at some staff members at work without feeling a twang of sadness
[02:34:43] <evilgohan2> Well, I can't recommend Marvel's Avengers in good conscience...
[02:35:07] <evilgohan2> Batman: Arkham Knight? If that's your thing anyway...
[02:35:16] <seku> ah, i dont get it. why envy women? each one has their hard lot to worry about
[02:35:28] <skye0> marvel -> disney -> copyright. i enjoyed older spider man though but it still wouldn't be enough for me to go out and pay for a spider man game - console exclusive too, and a slight sense of envy for mary-jane parker
[02:35:48] <evilgohan2> Mary Jane Watson-Parker, sir.
[02:36:02] <skye0> seku also feel sad i'd be more likely seen as a dude. my gender policing parents aren't helping either because if i really had to settle for a compromise i'd rather be seen like a femboy or some shit
[02:36:15] <skye0> evilgohan2 sorry, haven't kept up, not been interested in keeping up
[02:36:30] <evilgohan2> Eh, it's a 16 year old storyline ,but don't worry about it. Shit got retconned anyway
[02:36:44] <evilgohan2> OH! See, I didn't realize this was a situation about personal identity.
[02:36:46] <skye0> Â¬_Â¬ retcons
[02:36:48] <evilgohan2> Can't help you there.
[02:37:02] <seku> ah, if you do not want to be seen as a dude, make a move. either it works or it doesnt.
[02:37:07] <skye0> i need a therapist. i'm really hoping i'm gonna get paid. i plan to get a GPU for tensorflow related work
[02:37:29] <skye0> seku i'm worried about the ensuing friction - i'd love to avoid contact with parents and their peers in those situations
[02:37:32] <evilgohan2> going to say... now is definitely not the time to buy a GPU unless you have money to throwaway or are in desparate need...
[02:37:47] <evilgohan2> skye0: honestly, if you gotta do it, do what's best for you.
[02:38:02] <evilgohan2> if parents can't support that... that's on them to work out.
[02:38:04] <seku> skye0: that's fine too. monks are choosing that kind of life. just be sure to make up your mind
[02:38:13] <skye0> ok. just got to run some file organization errands that i don't think manually sorting out would do. also, asked someone for her previous private therapists, the prices are through the roof for me
[02:38:23] <joepie91> skye0: I'm not sure that the friction would be more than you are experiencing now
[02:38:33] <skye0> just need to save up
[02:38:35] <evilgohan2> Indeed. At least you won't be in conflict with who you are.
[02:38:48] <joepie91> skye0: like, to me it feels as if you have the choice of "friction between your choices and your family" vs. "friction between your expressed identity and what you want it to be"
[02:38:52] <joepie91> but you will have friction either way
[02:39:03] <skye0> if only i could move out - i'd rather not tell them this shit in person
[02:39:03] <evilgohan2> I'd choose the former, on a personal level.
[02:39:09] <evilgohan2> At least then I would be honest with myself.
[02:39:10] <joepie91> it ultimately has to be your choice, but I would pick the former
[02:39:15] <joepie91> because that is a problem that is likely to go away over time
[02:39:20] <joepie91> at least, in most circumstances
[02:39:43] <joepie91> (that's different if you know you'd immediately be thrown out of the house or something)
[02:40:44] <skye0> idk if i could be thrown out but it will get aggravating if i'm caught repeated times like when i was 15. was told i was "escaping reality" . my views of gender then were more rigid
[02:40:48] <skye0> i'd just be more comfortable expressing this in a medium that isn't face to face
[02:40:49] <evilgohan2> joepie91: since you're here, someone asked if bans from freenode carried over here.  Noting that the ban list is empty (or at least appears to be so), and no one necessarily is +o here - at least visibly, do you happen to know?
[02:41:17] <joepie91> evilgohan2: from a technical perspective, no. conceptually, yes
[02:41:32] <joepie91> that is, if I see someone return who was banned and who I have no reason to unban, they will be re-banned
[02:41:44] <joepie91> freenode -> libera was just an infrastructure move as far as I'm concerned
[02:42:12] <joepie91> (that having been said, I do give people second chances if I think they have any chance of success)
[02:42:26] <evilgohan2> That makes sense. Thanks Mr_Queue, that probably answers your question?
[02:42:46] <seku> for now the channel has been quite nicely flowing.
[02:42:52] <seku> now assholes manifesting yet :)
[02:42:56] <joepie91> yep
[02:43:06] <seku> *no
[02:43:08] <skye0> i'm quieted in another IRC channel though because i swore too much ;(
[02:43:17] <seku> you said so earlier
[02:43:18] <skye0> this channel is OK but i do feel lonely
[02:43:35] <Myself> skye0: It's funny, a few months pre-pandemic I was asking my therapist if he'd be open to doing video chat instead of in-person sessions (big flu-season germophobia here), and he said no, there's value to being in person. Fast-forward a few months and guess who's doing therapy by video chat? :D It's definitely worth asking around, there are options
[02:43:35] <Myself> aplenty now. 
[02:44:03] <skye0> Myself i'd rather write to my parents instead, call them if i absolutely have to
[02:44:03] *** ThePendulum is now known as I
[02:44:10] <I> hmm
[02:44:15] *** I is now known as ThePendulum
[02:44:21] <evilgohan2> You know what, Myself, honestly, I feel like there is something lost not being in person.
[02:44:25] <evilgohan2> Video just isn't the same to me.
[02:44:26] <skye0> with regards to practically coming out to them about my issues
[02:45:08] <skye0> only reason i don't prefer video calls is lack of privacy. occasionally my parents come in but they do a good job of respecting my privacy if i tell them i have a video call. can't guarantee soundproofing though
[02:45:10] <seku> i dont have a therapist. but i rather talk with friends in person than video chat.
[02:45:22] <seku> the lag, not able to feel or smell the person. a lot gets lost
[02:45:30] <Myself> evilgohan2: for sure, it's not identical, but it's still valuable. And if in-person is too intimidating for someone, the loss of in-person is a benefit.
[02:45:49] <skye0> seku trying to find people to talk to IRL about my shit, non-therapists who are LGBT+/allies. still don't feel close to them
[02:46:16] <evilgohan2> That's fair, Myself. Far be it for me to impose my thoughts on others. I just know that I've been feeling largely disconnected from people - even with video chat.
[02:46:18] <skye0> when i'm out with queer acquaintances: at least they understand my gender issues but i'd rather be playing battlefield 4
[02:46:51] <skye0> when i'm indoors playing battlefield 4: feeling bored and angry if i can't do well and lonely without a stream or people to talk to, and get pissed over unsympathetic people
[02:46:53] <seku> skye0: always remember that it is a giving/taking situation. sometimes you impose on other people with those discussions, but you need to give something back too.
[02:47:17] <seku> like listening to them too
[02:47:36] <evilgohan2> I went into the office last week - for the first time in over a year) as it was someone's last day and I wanted to say bye (plus get some last minute help). About 5 of us ended up being there (noting that we're all vaccinated). The experience of being able to speak to each other and collaborate IN PERSON felt amazing compared with the Zoom / Slack experience over the past year
[02:47:44] <skye0> evilgohan2 i'd like to work on enjoying being alone too. everyone will eventually die or force me out of their lives or something
[02:48:12] <seku> evilgohan2: yah, it's no contest
[02:48:26] <seku> meeting up with coworkers is really fun and missed
[02:48:32] <skye0> some people like working remotely, some people don't. i feel distracted when at home. part of why i switched jobs in the first place
[02:48:58] <Myself> Yeah, i've been taking a lot of walks, that seems to help me focus but it's still not 100%. 
[02:49:18] <evilgohan2> skye0: straight up, you sound depressed. That's not a criticism, just an observance, and an indication that you should reach out to a professional who is better equipped to help you
[02:49:43] <Myself> I love being able to start a load of laundry in the machine and go right back to working, but then it's easy to get distracted by chores and not work at all... Self-discipline has never been my strong suit.
[02:50:13] <seku> Myself: to me the problem is more making it easily through life without self discipline
[02:50:27] <seku> wonder where i could have ended up if i had any tho xD
[02:50:38] <Myself> Learning how many of my friends were also going to therapy really opened my mind to seeking it for myself, and it's helped quite a bit. 
[02:50:39] <evilgohan2> Myself: that got me into a spot of trouble in January. I started running water in the sink to wash dishes. Computer dings so I run upstairs. I get sidetracked at my desk... and the sink overflows onto the kitchen floor and into the basement causing water damage.
[02:50:41] <evilgohan2> That was not fun.
[02:50:47] <Myself> oh jeez
[02:50:56] <skye0> evilgohan2: I also admit sometimes I feel fucked in the head but I don't want to detail that. 
[02:50:59] <Myself> I've ruined a few pots on the stove that way.
[02:51:08] <Myself> boiled dry and warped the metal, etc
[02:51:13] <evilgohan2> That'll definitely do it.
[02:51:47] <skye0> I've been meaning to see someone because I find dÃ©jÃ  vu distressing but I keep putting it off. Got plans to contact my bank over paperwork too
[02:52:34] <skye0> Stuck in a conundrum where phone reminders stress me out or just get ignored or put off by me, but writing stuff down on a whiteboard just gets ignored. Will still consider your advice evilgohan2
[02:55:03] <Myself> The first appointment is definitely weird, not gonna lie, I was kinda nervous. You will be too, that's normal. It's also gonna seem silly in retrospect once you get to talking.
[02:55:42] <seku> ah... personally, i wonder how people manage to commit to something tho. like joepie91 to IT. or some of my friends to pro classical piano
[02:55:59] <seku> making such a decision is a very foreign concept to me
[02:56:12] <skye0> Got work to worry about too - I need to at least afford housing and private therapy
[02:56:31] <joepie91> seku: I haven't committed to IT actually, I've committed to activism
[02:56:34] <joepie91> IT is just the means to an end
[02:56:36] <Myself> It helps if you don't hate what you're committing to. ;) Or you like the idea of the long-term outcome enough to get over the short-term learning curve. 
[02:56:50] <seku> joepie91: now that's interesting. activisim as in privacy?
[02:56:58] <skye0> seku I keep putting it off. In one particular case I took up taekwondo and reached black tag before giving up because of exams
[02:57:04] <joepie91> seku: activism as in activism. as in making the world a better place
[02:57:14] <skye0> ,s/putting it off/giving up
[02:57:15] <joepie91> not any one specific cause
[02:57:15] <unfinity> 04<skye0> seku I keep giving up. In one particular case I took up taekwondo and reached black tag before giving up because of exams
[02:57:22] <evilgohan2> A job opening has posted... I actually qualify quite well for it, but I know nothing of the company, and their current logo on LinkedIn has been colored with the LGBT flag which makes me suspect of them.
[02:57:30] <seku> joepie91: yah, thats one thing i could and should invest myself in
[02:57:48] <skye0> evilgohan2: rainbow capitalism at work 
[02:58:16] <joepie91> seku: I tend to backseat-drive activism a lot - teaching other people how to do activism effectively and safely (and I don't just mean technical privacy/security but also the messy human and philosophical factors), providing infrastructural support, writing, etc.
[02:58:26] <evilgohan2> I'm automatically suspicious of companies that change  their logo to an LGBT flag in June because they're usually only doing so for PR reasons, but don't actually believe it. Just like when every company changed their logo to Black last year in support of #BLM, and then immediately stopped giving a fuck.
[02:58:29] <Myself> One thing I've been focusing on is milestones -- like I just helped a friend put solar panels on their new RV, and every time they'd talk about how confusing all the electrical stuff was, I'd say "Remember that, because in a few weeks you're gonna understand every bit of this, and you'll look back and laugh."
[02:58:30] <joepie91> just jumping in where it is needed and where I can make a difference
[02:58:36] <skye0> seku, joepie91, same but I can't help myself.
[02:58:41] <softpaw> i have a intuition the ever worsening epidemic of mental health issues have auto immune dysfunction as main cause due to various dietry, environmental and stress related factors, fix the auto immune u likley fix the mental health as long as not too chronic
[02:58:42] <seku> joepie91: hah, like meta-activism.... sounds great :D
[02:58:43] <skye0> evilgohan2: mmhm
[02:58:48] <joepie91> seku: yep basically
[02:59:31] <joepie91> seku: that's also what drives my long-term commitment to IT stuff -- the world runs on IT, and right now the tools and infrastructure are designed around capitalist interests, they are not designed for grassroots collaboration and organization
[02:59:48] <joepie91> and that is what I am trying to change, alongside a bunch of other issues like responsibility for what one builds in general
[02:59:49] <seku> im trying to do similar stuff... but not wiht IT stuff yet
[02:59:54] <Myself> So, seku, if you're intimidated about making a decision to commit to something ambitious, I'd encourage you to embrace that feeling and bookmark it as a point to look back on later and measure your growth.
[03:00:03] <skye0> envy was what ultimately drove me to martial arts. Had a slight interest in it but not enough for it to be worth it.
[03:00:34] <evilgohan2> softpaw: there is a school of thought that depression, anxiety, and stress actually do have long-term negative physical effects on health -- which is nothing to say of the potential for self-destructive behavior such as alcoholism, narcotic usage, drug abuse (distinctly distinguished from narcotic usage), risky sexual behavior, and other generally risky or behaviors.
[03:00:35] <seku> Myself: it's not the fear about committing, but more about the decision being worthwhile. 
[03:00:58] <skye0> joepie91: I just pull off illegalist shit like scraping for similar reasons. Content and culture and knowledge are being preserved solely for profit
[03:01:17] <Myself> Ahh, well it's your time to choose how you spend it. So by definition if you choose to do that, then that's what you wanted. There's no such thing as wsted time, only missed lessons.

[03:04:12] <Myself> what if you commit to doing X lessons or Y weeks or reaching Z skill level, then you reevaluate? Build in a checkpoint, so it's not a "forever" commitment. 
[03:05:03] <softpaw> evilgohan2 yea theres a great book on libgen about MDD and the auto immune link, but few health pros interested, theres might be an easy fix i used called food grade diamotaceous earth, by chelating ROS reactive oxygen species and other toxins from alcohol & drug abuse 
[03:05:47] <seku> Myself: if i am completely honest, such a plan would be boring the hell out of me. i can appreciate that it would be the correct path to take... but it sounds uninteresting
[03:06:08] *** Joins: sumthing1980 (~sumthing1@94.54.64.154)
[03:06:26] <seku> i always do stuff in a "rush". be it classical piano, my studies 12 years back, or my work.
[03:06:27] <Myself> huh, so is it the thrill that's interesting, of making a commitment that might have consequences?
[03:06:46] <Myself> Oh yeah, the Duke effect!
[03:06:59] <seku> it;s more like searching for a thrill where there's none

[03:07:46] <seku> yeah, that's it
[03:08:06] <seku> maybe unhealthy
[03:08:57] <seku> if there is no thrill, one has to create it.
[03:09:08] <evilgohan2> "I am the hype!"
[03:09:18] <seku> a bit sad, isn't it?
[03:09:44] <evilgohan2> hmm
[03:12:15] <seku> it's a bitter pill to swallow. trying to push yourself for a moment. and you see it's good enough. but never pushing yourself to your real limits :D
[03:14:31] <seku> thats why i am interested in what joepie91 does. makes way more sense to me.

[03:17:47] <joepie91> be careful with the "pushing yourself to your real limits"
[03:17:49] <joepie91> that has a mental health cost :)
[03:18:48] <seku> joepie91: hencewhy i never did it. still feels like wasted potential

[03:20:24] <seku> i don't know tho. society feels like it's being built on giving 10, maybe 20%. 
[03:20:47] <joepie91> seku: I mean, there's a midpoint. push yourself but not to a breaking point
[03:21:13] <seku> agreed. 
[03:21:30] <seku> at some point tho it needs to make sense.
[03:22:20] <seku> i think we both are living work lives with ... adequate compensation
[03:23:21] <seku> maybe i should switch tho. pay is nice, but there's nothing really interesting, or mind tickling happening.
[03:24:21] <seku> the age old question. money/security vs fun

[17:36:51] <riff-IRC> ,bribe
[17:37:34] <skye0> riff-IRC: got loose sockets but aside from that it's usable. Mother complained about the lack of surge protection though 
[17:38:06] <riff-IRC> loose sockets? yikes, shut it down, go buy some 5-15R plugs, and get those replaced ASAP.
[17:38:33] <riff-IRC> And when shopping for surge protectors, CHECK THE UL LABEL.
[17:38:45] <riff-IRC> If it says "relocatable power tap", put it back,
[17:39:00] <skye0> slightly loose sockets - the panel just needs replacing or tightening up
[17:39:38] <riff-IRC> Look for "Surge Protective Device", "Also Listed SPD", "Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor", "Also Listed TVSS", "Also Listed SPD/TVSS"
[17:40:02] <riff-IRC> How loose is the socket? Does it not grip the plug good?
[17:40:26] <skye0> actually it's just the panel that's loose 
[17:40:40] <skye0> Because I live in the UK our sockets nearly always have switches too - our outlets also are three pronged, with one pin longer than the rest for grounding
[17:40:40] <riff-IRC> The panel itself is loose in the wall?
[17:40:46] <skye0> slightly 
[17:40:57] <skye0> Sockets I think are alright 
[17:41:02] <riff-IRC> As long as the electrical connections are good and tight, no problem.
[17:41:32] <skye0> Will need to consider a surge protection extension cable though 
[17:41:57] <riff-IRC> (I'm in the USA, so my electrical talk is based from a USA standpoint)
[17:42:02] <riff-IRC> yep
[17:42:15] <riff-IRC> Make sure that it complies with BS1363
[17:43:13] <skye0> yeah, I've lived in the US and Philippines, which use the same sockets - I would get mild electric shock from even plugging things in, tried to do it at night too to charge a battery

[18:46:04] <kron> hi, this might be a long shot, but being a storage-focused channel: does anyone have a source on whether ssd controllers catch zero-writes (writing only zeroes), or nop-writes (writing the same data as is currently stored at destination)?
[18:55:40] *** Joins: Fiji (~Fiji@user/fiji)
[18:58:32] <NiLon> good question, no idea but sounds something that might be even optimized at system level
[18:59:11] <NiLon> tho zero writes are not "not writing", it's a value so I don't see why it would prevent that
[18:59:51] <NiLon> and kind of zero is the value that gets written in the first place, not 1
[19:02:01] <kron> NiLon: yes, a zero-write still needs to be recorded, but it could be shortened by marking that LBA range as "this contains zeroes" in some bookkeeping structure, instead of actually writing that amount of data somewhere
[19:03:24] <NiLon> sure, but that might get insanely complex if you need to split large file a lot and your index starts to get huge
[19:06:05] <NiLon> if you update a segment with that large block of zeroes you would need to split it into two and this keeps happening eventually leading to a point where there isn't large block of zeores physically even if you see that in filesystem
[19:06:28] <NiLon> but who knows, maybe there is something like that, seems unlikely
[19:06:48] <NiLon> too complex for fairly minor effect
[19:06:53] *** Quits: Fiji (~Fiji@user/fiji) (Quit: Leaving)
[19:08:12] <kron> not necessarily. what distinguishes a page that is logically full of zeroes from an unallocated page? couldn't you just discard the target pages of a zero-write?
