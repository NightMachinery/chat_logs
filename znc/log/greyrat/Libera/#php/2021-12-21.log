[00:02:13] <foo> Upgrading php on an ubuntu box. Can someone confirm "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php" seems like a sane thing to do? Not sure if ondrej/php is a well known repo for doing this?

[00:03:02] <relipse> foo: yep that's typical for latest php
[00:03:16] <da_wunder> ^
[00:03:30] <zenox2> tbh though, i've always found irc to be more helpful, more knowledgeable, and more friendly than slack
[00:03:33] <biberu> is installing directly on the host sane? ü§î
[00:04:50] <relipse> installing what directly on the host biberu ?
[00:04:56] <zenox2> better how else are you going to get it on the host then?
[00:05:10] <biberu> relipse: in this case php
[00:05:19] <da_wunder> zenox2: and I would just say the oppos√≠te - what I have seen in IRC since 2000, IRC is quite hostile and those new platforms like slack are not so much hostile - actually symfony slack is more friendly than #symfony
[00:05:44] <relipse> what host?
[00:06:05] <biberu> zenox2: i like scripted and isolated environment, and needing to upgrade suggests this isn't that
[00:06:08] <relipse> it seems that the more anonymous you get, the more hostile you get too
[00:06:22] <zenox2> wunder, i remember php on dal and efnet about 20 years ago. the wild days. those were super days
[00:06:48] <biberu> relipse: the host os

[01:14:08] <__adrian> you overrode the function, but you never called it.
[01:14:40] <__adrian> pubgreet() always calls Robot::greet().  that's what `self` means - * this * class.
[01:14:56] <Azrael_-> doesn't "return self::greet();" call this function? if i move them to "non-static", then it works like expected.
[01:15:02] <__adrian> no
[01:15:05] <da_wunder> like - https://3v4l.org/M0ejY
[01:15:08] <__adrian> self === this class (Robot)
[01:15:40] <Azrael_-> and "$this" isn't available in the static context
[01:15:58] <__adrian> yes, i know
[01:16:03] <__adrian> see da_wunder's example
[01:16:08] <chazy> for a date interval of just time, do i need to specify both P and T? or just T like 1 hour would be T1H or PT1H?

[01:17:07] <Azrael_-> ah, thanks. sorry, didn't catch the example of da_wunder. with static it is exactly what i was looking for
[01:17:09] <__adrian> chazy: P is _always_ the first character in the $duration format

[01:22:01] <chazy> so if i want to format a DateInterval() with days weeks months and years, do i need to make a switch()?
[01:22:04] <__adrian> "P" is not optional
[01:22:31] <chazy> sorry i mean, with one of those, not all
[01:22:34] <__adrian> i don't follow why you would need a switch
[01:22:58] <chazy> i have $period that can be either days, weeks, months or years

[01:23:07] <__adrian> right
[01:23:14] <chazy> i need cases for each?

[01:26:06] <__adrian> use the format() function. there's no switching involved.

[01:28:58] <chazy> i mean that what i pass to the DateInterval() constructor is a variable, so i don't know if it's days, weeks, months or years
[01:29:13] <chazy> also, intl takes care of plurals?
[01:29:58] <__adrian> intl: yes. you'd have to define the language strings, i think, i don't see anything builtin for intervals.

[01:30:28] <__adrian> work with the _object_.

[01:30:53] <__adrian> pretend it doesn't exist

[01:33:24] <__adrian> the dateinterval class is parsing that string. you should not also parse it.
[01:33:30] <chazy> what do i pass to format()?
[01:33:52] <__adrian> if you want different language strings depending on the interval, then check the object properties and decide from there.
[01:34:13] <chazy> $interval can be 'P1D' or 'P1W' or 'P1M' or 'P1Y'
[01:34:20] <__adrian> foreach() might make sense. i don't see how switch() is relevantr
[01:34:48] <__adrian> do you know what i mean by "dateinterval object properties" ?

[06:31:41] <PersonX> Hey there, still learning, been reading up, but mind is confused. I'm trying to use a form within my website, to get an http request of this: https://ow-api.com/docs/#stats - I am confused on how to get the data, should I use cURL? Also, how do I replace or get the URL to get the data I want / need. Here is what I have, which I know is probably
[06:31:42] <PersonX> completely wrong: https://pastebin.com/gksAUZJn - Any help is appreciated in getting me on the write path. Thank you.
[06:35:53] <Blondie101010> besides the fact that you just output the json content, I don't see what is your actual problem
[06:37:41] <__adrian> mm. validate inputs, check the response, properly encode the output
[06:39:27] <PersonX> If I replace "https://ow-api.com/v1/stats/:platform/:region/:battletag/profile" with "https://ow-api.com/v1/stats/pc/us/PersonX-11315/profile" I get the proper returned data. My question is how would I achieve this via a users input (for each :platform, :battletag, and :region) through a form on my website. The first line I gave you, was what I
[06:39:27] <PersonX> came up with, which is probably very wrong.
[06:39:42] <PersonX> Thank you

[06:42:25] <__adrian> e.g., i'm going to guess that there's probably a list of specific values that "platform" and "region" are allowed to be, and that there are specific formats/allowed characters/etc. for the other two

[06:50:07] <PersonX> I understand, I think. I'll try to go over my inputs, but other than that, is there a better way of achieving what I am trying to do? (get the returned data on the successful second link, on the second message I sent)
[06:51:49] <__adrian> i don't know what problem/solution you're questioning, so i don't know. if there's something specific you're asking about, please explain your question in more detail.
[06:52:26] <__adrian> e.g., "i'm doing {x} on line {y} and {z} happens, but i want {abc} to happen"
[06:54:30] <PersonX> I am trying to allow a user to fill in a form (with the fields I pasted in my code paste) in order to retrieve the data/objects, so that I can display the data back to the user (from the api url), then the user can click an import button and import the data returned to my websites database. So far, I am having difficulty successfully getting the
[06:54:30] <PersonX> data to be returned, which you have both said is most likely because of my inputs / validation. But I am curious if there is a better way of achieving what I am after, in both / all of your expertise. Thank-you.
[06:56:02] <__adrian> please tell me if i understand you correctly:  user submits form ‚Üí you make api request ‚Üí you show api response ‚Üí user re-submits api response ‚Üí you store in your DB

[06:58:10] <PersonX> "user re-submits api response" maybe isn't correct, I mean if the api response is already being shown to the user, I want the user to be able to look over it, then click submit to store in my DB yes.
[06:58:25] <PersonX> but yes, I suppose that's right
[06:58:29] <__adrian> why don't you just store the response in the first place?
[07:02:02] <PersonX> I guess I could, but there is limited data (if the api returns "private" being true), I would like the user to make their profile public, so I can store ALL the data returned (as it's important).
[07:02:50] <__adrian> that sounds like something you should address with "check the response" - i.e., check that it's not 404, check that it's not marked "private," etc.
[07:02:57] <__adrian> give the user an error message if it is.

[12:59:14] <edantes> is there a way i can force the type of array items created by explode() ?
[12:59:15] <edantes> e.g. with explode(":", "1:2:3") i would like each number to be an int
[13:00:37] <stenno> you could just map it
[13:00:56] <edantes> can i map and explode in one go?
[13:01:13] <edantes> or you mean explode into an array and then map items to int
[13:01:26] <grawity> define "in one go"
[13:01:34] <grawity> do you want it to be in 1 line of code, or 1 function call
[13:01:50] <stenno> array_map(fn($el) => intval($el), explode(':', "1:2:3'))
[13:02:14] <edantes> with "in one go" i mean in one function call
[13:02:18] <stenno> why
[13:02:20] <edantes> thanks stenno
[13:02:28] <stenno> does it need to be in a single function call
[13:02:32] <edantes> why not, it's more elegant
[13:02:33] <grawity> yeah I don't think there's going to be a function call for something that specific

[13:05:53] <edantes> very much appreciated thanks
[13:06:34] <grawity> ah in php5 you don't have fn() but I *think* you can just array_map('intval', explode(etc))
[13:06:56] <stenno> oh php5
[13:07:12] <stenno> grawity: i forget that stuff like that works, nice one
[13:07:22] <grawity> not that you ought to be writing php5 today... but could be worse, could be a language without map()
[13:09:21] <edantes> not that I could chose the language someone picked X years ago, but yes could be a lot worse indeed
[13:09:38] <edantes> grawity: precisely, also (int) $value would work i guess
[13:09:43] *** Joins: luigibu (~luigi@80.30.200.2)
[13:10:48] <grawity> well, good thing about php5 is that it's upgradeable to php7
[13:11:12] <grawity> right but you can't map (int) over an array easily, unless ... in php5 I guess it'd be array_map(function($arg) { return (int) $arg; }, explode(etc))
[13:11:28] <grawity> don't remember which 5.x introduced functions as objects
[13:11:47] <edantes> exactly, 1:1 what i came up with
[13:12:37] <edantes> i am trying to convince management to let me upgrade to php7, currently setting up xhperf so i can show some powerpoints with before/after performance graphs
[13:13:13] <grawity> maybe go directly to php8, because by the time it goes through management php7.x will be obsolete lol
[13:13:41] <grawity> ...then again we still have a webapp that runs on 5.2 because it relies on register_globals, and the "backend" is managed through a wonky desktop app, so it all runs on a Win2003 server...
[13:13:54] <tirnanog> grawity: I believe it was 5.3, if you mean first-class functions.
[13:15:44] <edantes> grawity similar situation here, windows legacy desktop app from the 90s coupled with an old backend, plus spaghetti code
[13:16:15] <edantes> literal nonsense such as this gem:
[13:16:16] <edantes> ```
[13:16:16] <edantes> if (1=1) {
[13:16:17] <edantes> ```
[13:17:49] <grawity> seen worse
[13:18:50] <edantes> it's an acquired taste i guess
[13:19:07] <grawity> this app stores passwords in plaintext, but puts md5($user.$password) in the auth cookie
[13:19:22] <grawity> how does it know which user is logged in, if all it has is md5($user.$password)?
[13:19:47] <grawity> it gets the usernames and passwords of everyone in the DB, loops over each one, calculating md5($u.$p) until it finds a match to the cookie
[13:19:54] <grawity> every single page
[13:20:10] <edantes> let me help you with this handy solution i have here: $_SESSION["SESSION_VARS_user_logged_in"]

[18:35:00] <stenno> 1=1 is even worse because its an assignment

[18:38:19] <stenno> relipse: this is what i meant with 'it should throw'
[18:38:22] <Naktibalda> maybe it was WHERE 1=1 in SQL

[19:33:51] <Koopz> have any of you tinkered with LDAP and objectGUIDs in PHP?
[19:35:19] <Koopz> so the plan is to retrieve objects from the AD, store their objectGUIDs and other fields in my own DB and setup a cronjob that keeps the data in my DB synced with the AD by querying the AD for the objectGUID and updating the fields
[19:35:45] <Naktibalda> what's the problem?
[19:36:02] <Koopz> since the objectGUIDs are uh... coming in binary from the AD i apply a bin2hex on the data before storing it
[19:36:31] <Naktibalda> where do you store it?
[19:36:43] <Koopz> in a MariaDB table
[19:36:57] *** Joins: Forza (~Forza@user/forza)
[19:37:14] <Naktibalda> you could store it in binary form
[19:37:29] <Koopz> i don't really care about storing it as a blob, what'd rather interest me is querying the AD during the sync job using that data
[19:37:56] <Koopz> i read i'd need to escape the hex string with backslashes
[19:38:48] <Koopz> so i got 8fa1c430e8f55248a3042b647a3e1c41 and would need to turn it into \8f\a1\c4\30\e8\f5\52\48\a3\04\2b\64\7a\3e\1c\41 and the query would work
[19:39:25] <Koopz> so... just split the thing in 2 character bits and prepend with a backlash and be done with it?
[19:39:43] <Koopz> or would there be a more elegant solution?
[19:40:01] <stenno> i used ldap with php and never had to parse anything
[19:40:39] <Koopz> https://www.php.net/manual/de/function.ldap-search.php#37475
[19:40:45] <Koopz> have you queried objectGUIDs?
[19:43:43] <Koopz> oh hold up i just tried querying the field using the hex2bin()ed version and that works just as well
[19:44:08] <Koopz> never mind then :D
[19:44:59] <Koopz> feels weird having binary data in the middle of a string but okay
[19:45:09] <Koopz> if LDAP eats it

[21:15:23] <AllenJB> goddard: You're going to have to be a bit more specific. If you're trying to enable gd with freetype and having issues, you might want to post the problem you're having rather than an aimless, ranty "question". Are you trying to install PHP from packages or source? What distro and repos are involved? What error are you getting?

[21:19:14] <AllenJB> I'm not familiar with Docker or the PHP Docker image, but from a brief Google and my knowledge of compiling and installing from source, should the configure step not come before the install step?
[21:20:01] <relipse> is docker pretty common for PHP Developers?
[21:20:17] <relipse> I find myself using the built in server and ubuntu wsl2
[21:21:21] <goddard> docker is great if you develop with a team and have a complicated setup that requires many extensions and other configurations

[21:25:28] <AllenJB> as a tradeoff Docker can also introduce (potentially unnecessary) complexity, especially with regards to networking. My biggest complaint about Docker is the lack of a firewall reload command, so if you ever reload your host firewall rules manually, you kill all the Docker networking and have to completely restart Docker
