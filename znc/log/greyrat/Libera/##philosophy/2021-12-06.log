[03:11:58] <tomathy> when someone says something controversial or when cliques get together and talk
[03:12:16] <tomathy> that's the same throughout the internet
[03:12:41] <tomathy> it has to be controversial AND novel though
[03:13:08] <tomathy> or have a novel quality about it, such as its style
[03:13:23] <tomathy> for example "covid is fake" won't cut it
[03:14:34] <betashaft> unfortunate. Thats my go to conversation starter
[03:14:40] <tomathy> you'd have to say "covid is so real, i mean hand sanitiser has no change of accelerating MRSA, and masks dont cause respiritory disease through reinhaled water vapour"

[04:50:33] <biys> betashaft: it kind of goes into the idea of social change that seems to be apparent within the sustainable development/social change that it seems is intertwined in the curriculum round these here parts
[04:50:39] <biys> i'll tell you what
[05:01:50] <audrey> Watched an old Soviet movie from the 1960s ... I must have already watched it a hundred times but it gets better each time, somehow
[05:02:09] <audrey> Kind of a shame Russian culture ends up being perpetually set back and stunted.
[05:02:25] <audrey> There were a few good periods for art/culture/film that went nowhere.

[05:42:44] <biys> i uh
[05:43:22] <biys> idk if it was as much stunted as it was...  a work in progress
[05:44:07] <biys> the Kievan prior to Moscows ascendancy it would've been pretty interesting
[05:44:20] <biys> the rest of all that is just as a result of Christianization
[05:44:43] <biys> Then the reforms of Peter I
[05:44:59] <biys> in which they adapted a westernized model
[05:45:32] <biys> but i've only really read Gay Saul Morsons's "Russian literature" Britannica work
[05:46:15] <biys> it was kind of like... writing the christian doctrine and the holy books
[05:46:21] <biys> bits of fighting
[05:46:24] <biys> bits of war
[05:46:28] <biys> lots more religion
[05:46:31] <biys> bit more fighting
[05:47:32] <biys> i'd say the most interesting time was late 19th early 20th
[05:47:58] <biys> unless we're gonna talk about like... the stalin era
[05:48:13] <biys> or the post revolutionary literature
[05:48:25] <biys> idk.  it just seems really hard for me to summarize russian literature in but a few words
[05:49:06] <biys> if i absolutely HAD to.  i'd say religion and translation are the primary motif of russian literature.

[12:28:57] <arryana> his avatar is a cat, and his name is 'cat likes beer'.  and the only two things i have ever heard him say are 'meow' and 'fucking meow'
[12:29:09] <arryana> it's impressive how emotive that can be.

[12:29:36] <plank> fucking meow

[12:32:07] <arryana> i like the myst game, but i have to be in a puzzle mood.  which is rare.

[17:45:23] <tomathy> what thinkest thou of the relationship between Christianity and Atheism?
[17:45:57] <tomathy> not in modern form
[17:46:25] <tomathy> can it be said that Christianity was the first established, concrete, coherent, sustainable form of atheism?
[17:46:58] <tomathy> since they had to reject a monistic God to accept Jesus as the incarnation
[17:47:09] <tomathy> although not necessarily

[17:48:32] <mannequin> a good atheist will be prefered over a sinnfull christian
[17:48:54] <tomathy> by whom?
[17:48:59] <mannequin> because the church is an organ emerged long after Christ died
[17:49:12] <mannequin> tomathy: by God and his angels
[17:49:23] <tomathy> i accept that
[17:49:42] <tomathy> although there is the idea of sins being pardoned by the sacrifice of Christ
[17:49:56] <tomathy> and the sins of those who do not accept his sacrifice being unpardoned
[17:50:16] <mannequin> blood spilled for Christ is not what that prophet wanted
[17:50:41] <mannequin> it's what church wants

[17:53:00] <tomathy> the greek seeks after wisdom
[17:53:14] <I_Am_M00t> I think you'd need a powerful telescope to spot religious thought from the viewpoint of Greek philosophy

[17:55:42] <Ungwelian> I_Am_M00t, have you read much Christian theology?
[17:57:18] <I_Am_M00t> I haven't looked much further than the OT/NT, should I have to?
[17:57:50] <Ungwelian> Well, yes :)
[17:58:12] <Ungwelian> There's well over a thousand years of Christian theology.
[17:58:30] <mannequin> final version of abstract 27: https://vlepy.github.io/2021/12/06/abstract27.html
[17:58:30] <ro-bot-o> [url] Abstract 27 | vlepy.github.io
[17:58:48] <I_Am_M00t> I'll look to Hinduism instead
[17:59:01] <I_Am_M00t> if I want poetry
[17:59:11] <Ungwelian> The Bible is pretty much the tip of the iceberg. And even it is a collection of texts as decided by the Church.
[17:59:33] <Ungwelian> Beyond that, you have so much more.
[18:00:01] <I_Am_M00t> and where does the buck stop? You can say that about many systems of thought
[18:00:13] <Ungwelian> For example, under the Vatican there's a whole, massive library of Christian texts.
[18:00:24] <Ungwelian> Kept in specific environmental conditions.
[18:00:44] <Ungwelian> You have esotericism, conservatism, progressivism, all of it.
[18:01:46] <I_Am_M00t> I draw a line somewhere, if the religion as practiced is gobshite, it's gobshite. The other stuff is on the fringe
[18:01:49] <Ungwelian> Along with this, you have ongoing theology as published by the Church.
[18:02:06] <Ungwelian> And of course, there are so many Christian churches.
[18:02:18] <Ungwelian> All with varying interpretations.
[18:02:46] <Ungwelian> There's even cross-faith theology.

[18:04:43] <Ungwelian> C.S. Lewis wrote nice and very popular theology.
[18:05:10] <Ungwelian> "Mere Christianity" was IIRR a pretty ok book when I read it.
[18:06:32] <I_Am_M00t> "A Course in Miracles" I've heard is decent
[18:06:50] <Ungwelian> My personal favourite in the literature is perhaps hagiography, although I've read just a little of it.
[18:06:53] <I_Am_M00t> for instance
[18:07:01] <Ungwelian> You essentially have Christian superhero stories.
[18:07:15] <Ungwelian> A bit like reading Marvel's comics.
[18:07:34] <I_Am_M00t> ok, but, what do you want me to do with that?
[18:07:46] <Ungwelian> Well of course nothing, if it's not your cup of tea :)
[18:08:04] <I_Am_M00t> have you checked out a Course in Miracles?
[18:08:20] <Ungwelian> I don't remember it, so probably not.
[18:09:09] <I_Am_M00t> tomathy: what do you think about A Course in Miracles?
[18:10:45] <I_Am_M00t> Ungwelian: I think asking actual Christians about Christian works you think are good will show interesting results.

[18:23:28] <Ungwelian> I have a vague memory of discussing him with you, audrey.
[18:23:29] <I_Am_M00t> Ungwelian: lol, nope... but, if everyone on the fringe is a Christian theologist, then I don't have any problems with the comparison
[18:24:04] <I_Am_M00t> but I'd be more curious about the works tomathy is considering, than broadly looking at Christian theology
[18:24:26] <I_Am_M00t> some Christian works are almost atheistic, and I doubt Christian accept them
[18:24:36] <I_Am_M00t> I doubt Christians accept them*

[18:25:17] <audrey> I have a distaste for Christian theology, so I´ll just excuse myself from this conversation
[18:25:57] <Ungwelian> Cf. Hinduism. You have your Vedas and the Gītā - past that, you have a lot of Hindu theology.
[18:26:48] <Ungwelian> Same with Islam too. A lot of theology beyond the Qur'an.
[18:27:14] <mannequin> i like

[19:36:56] <audrey> The little devil on my left shoulder is whispering that I should just have a few flings and wild weekends while I´m still young and (reasonably) good looking - but god, that just seems so empty.
[19:37:19] <arryana> i don't personally believe there's only one person for everyone, but i can see how it would feel that way
[19:38:17] <arryana> i'd even go further and say that if something happened to my other half, i wouldn't have another relationship
[19:38:24] <arryana> hm.
[19:38:30] <arryana> i don't think flings are for everyone
[19:39:21] <arryana> and you'll be pretty for a long time, i wouldn't worry about that
[19:39:26] <arryana> you're not the sort who ages badly
[19:40:16] <mannequin> i wonder does arryana still keep me on her ignore list
[19:41:04] <arryana> shallow, stupid people generally age poorly, they have nothing else to show for their time on earth
[19:41:16] <arryana> you have interests, goals.
[19:41:28] <biys> audrey: you read any pushkin ?
[19:42:18] <audrey> biys: Yes, why?
[19:42:34] <biys> you were on about russian lit yesterday
[19:43:13] <audrey> Oh, right
[19:43:46] <biys> how do you figure russian literature was stunted btw?
[19:44:11] <audrey> I was thinking more about art and film in yesterday´s conversation, than literature specifically
[19:44:49] <audrey> But my general point was that Russia has endured a lot of societal upheaval/disruption, which has not been good for the flourishing of the arts.
[19:45:36] * arryana tries to think of any disrupted society which is better off for it with regards to the arts, and fails to find an example
[19:45:44] <audrey> The crackdown on artistic expression in the Stalinist era, for example, along with state-mandated art, killed the promise and creativity of the 1920s.
[19:45:59] <biys> okay stalin era
[19:46:04] <biys> that is what i responded with
[19:46:15] <biys> i took it as a conversation of russian lit on a whole
[19:46:24] <biys> from like... first century Kievan
[19:46:42] <audrey> And you had something similar happen in film after perestroika. There was a brief window in Soviet filmmaking between 1986 and 1992, after the censorship was relaxed but before the crass Westernization began
[19:47:08] <biys> westernization was as a result of peter the great
[19:47:10] <audrey> And there were some really deep, hard-hitting movies produced in that timeframe. Little Vera, Brother

[19:49:01] <biys> once you stray from the translation/creation of the holy texts
[19:49:03] <audrey> In the 1990s there was this newfound obsession with trying to make Russian culture in America´s image - I like to regale people with the story of the time a police officer in Siberia stopped my friend´s father´s Ford station wagon, because he´d never seen an American car before and wanted to admire it.
[19:49:04] <biys> and writing all there is to write about war
[19:49:08] <biys> you need to gleem frmo other sources
[19:49:16] <biys> to establish and completely understand your own identity

[19:49:22] <arryana> god, not a ford
[19:49:28] <arryana> adnire a chevy, sure
[19:49:51] <audrey> arryana: Well, to this cop out in the middle of nowhere, a Ford was as cool as a Mercedes because it was Made in America
[19:50:04] <arryana> i see why this is so tragic
[19:50:07] * arryana giggles
[19:50:09] <biys> FORD they also do you the favour of circling the problem before you buy it
[19:50:25] <audrey> FORD is a little-known acronym - Fix Or Repair Daily
[19:50:39] <biys> still the best selling trucks year after year tho
[19:50:44] <biys> so they do have that
[19:51:32] <biys> i specifically avoided stalin russia when we were talking

[19:52:31] <audrey> biys: I think I get the source of our confusion in this conversation (if there was any) - I tend to focus on the last 150 years or so. I´m not really a historian in the proper sense, anything earlier than that simply doesn´t interest me.
[19:52:53] <audrey> So when I speak of «Russian history» I´m usually referring to the timeline of Nicholas I onwards
[19:53:05] <audrey> (I guess that´s closer to 200 years)
[19:53:34] <biys> fair enough.  i had to do a brief summar on russian literature a bit back
[19:54:02] <biys> it's the only reason i have the perspective i have
[19:54:22] <biys> like i said though, i stopped pretty much at the beginning of the 20th century
[19:54:56] <biys> it's crazy though
[19:55:24] <biys> the conquest that transpired over the first 14 centuries
[19:56:14] <biys> given russian origins.   if russia wrote anything, it woudl be about how much culture they've amalgamated
[19:56:48] <biys> one of the thigns i like to think about is what the first rusky would look like back at the end of the 1st century
[19:58:40] <arryana> is there a russian movie you'd recommend above all others?
[20:02:18] <pussipupu> And is it Hedgehog in Fog?

[20:07:31] <tomathy> why are ginger women so beautiful
[20:10:29] <audrey> arryana: Depends what you´re in the mood for. My personal favorites are: Battleship Potemkin (high historical value and one of the best films ever made in general), Little Vera (perestroika film, very biting social commentary on generational divides), Twelve Chairs  (satire based on a novel from the 1920s)
[20:11:20] <audrey> All three should be available online with English subtitles
[20:12:36] <arryana> i'm wide open as to style.
[20:12:46] * arryana notes them
[20:12:51] <arryana> thanks, i'll have a look
[20:15:06] <arryana> i'd rather watch something with subtitles than with overdub, most of the time
[20:17:03] <pussipupu> Dubbing is a terrible thing
[20:19:18] <arryana> it sort of hollows out the feeling.
[20:24:23] <pussipupu> Even if the secondary casting is good it's an extra layer between you and the art in a way subtitles aren't

[21:05:09] <pussipupu> Random question but is it right that in the US medical doctors aren't necessarily doctor doctors?
[21:05:20] <pussipupu> like they don't necessarily have a PhD?
[21:05:49] <pussipupu> Or maybe they have a doctorate but it's not a PhD
[21:06:09] <mannequin> they mostly don't have doctorates
[21:06:14] <mannequin> same here in poland
[21:06:31] <mannequin> i prefer to call them "lekarz" (meditian) than a doctor
[21:06:40] <mannequin> because doctor is a scientific degree
[21:14:19] <pussipupu> In Finnish there are separate words too
[21:14:51] <pussipupu> In English we reused the scholar word to mean medic, but in the UK at least the medic qualification is a PhD
[21:30:43] <arryana> hm
[21:30:45] <arryana> i have no idea.
[21:30:58] <arryana> md and phd are not the same, to my understanding
[21:31:06] <arryana> i can ask my md friend, when she's off work, if you like
[21:31:31] <arryana> i believe she has a phd, but she was a researcher before she was a doctor
[21:31:37] <arryana> i don't know how common that is
[21:34:35] <audrey> Лекарь (ljékar´) is a folksy word for «doctor» or «healer» in Russian
[21:34:49] <audrey> Always fascinated with the similarities between Slavic languages
[21:35:11] <mannequin> nothing fascinating about it
[21:35:18] <mannequin> we did split from one tribe
[21:35:19] <audrey> (On the flip side, uroda means not «beauty», but «hideous person»! Talk about a false friend)
[21:35:43] <audrey> Sure, but I have a nerdy fascination with languages.
[21:35:56] <audrey> And sometimes the similarities are humorous
[21:36:28] <arryana> linguistics are fun
[21:36:38] <pussipupu> lääkäri is doctor, as in medic in Finnish
[21:36:46] *** Quits: ElQelinho (~ElQelinho@91.192.22.238) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:36:51] <pussipupu> tohtori is doctor as in scholar
[21:37:18] <audrey> But yes, Dr. in the United States is not just a title given to medical professionals
[21:37:25] <audrey> Anyone with a doctorate degree is technically a Dr.
[21:38:58] <pussipupu> that's not quite what I meant to ask, what I meant is can you be a (medical) doctor without being a PhD
[21:39:20] <pussipupu> in the UK system doctors aren't necessarily medical either
[21:39:34] <audrey> Oh, got it.
[21:39:37] <mannequin> you can be a doctor in robotics
[21:39:41] <audrey> I´m not sure how that works.
[21:40:14] <mannequin> or a doctor honoris causa in robotics
[21:40:23] <mannequin> honoured doctor
[21:40:27] <pussipupu> now I think more I think they get an MD, which is a doctorate but not a PhD
[21:41:13] <audrey> Medicinis Doctor
[21:41:23] <audrey> Well it´s a doctorate level degree similar to Juris Doctor
[21:45:24] <arryana> google says...
[21:45:29] <arryana> Their educational background typically includes an undergraduate degree in a pre-medicine field of study, such as biology or chemistry, followed by four years of medical school. Physicians who wish to specialize in a particular field of medicine typically complete an additional three to eight years of internship and residency training.
[21:45:34] <arryana> that's for a medical doctor
