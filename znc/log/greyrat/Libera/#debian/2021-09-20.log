[00:00:05] <sney> bullseye is the latest debian stable, 11.0. it was released last month. you're on 10.10 which is buster, the previous debian stable
[00:00:09] <bae> 6.1.something
[00:00:36] <alkisg> bae, run this: grep VERSION /etc/os-release
[00:00:42] <alkisg> What's the output?
[00:01:04] <sney> alkisg: they already answered the debian version, /etc/debian_version is 10.10
[00:01:41] <alkisg> sney: buster has ucblogo 6.0, not 6.1
[00:01:47] <alkisg> OK though :)
[00:01:50] <bae> alkisg patience, I'm C-z and fg
[00:02:08] <sney> alkisg: the github tarball is 6.1
[00:02:19] <bae> Right.
[00:02:41] <bae> It's got objects added, and multiple turtles (allegedly)
[00:02:53] <sney> is 6.2 not acceptable?
[00:03:15] <bae> sney no, 6.2 would be great...does it exist?
[00:03:34] <sney> bae: it's in bullseye. you could update to bullseye, or you could use the dpkg bot's instructions above to backport the debian package

[00:03:59] <sney> either one would be a better option than building source from github
[00:04:10] <bae> How do I update to bullseye? I'm not on straight debian...it's Pardus
[00:04:17] <sney> ...
[00:04:23] <sney> !based on debian
[00:04:23] <dpkg> Your distribution may be based on and have software in common with Debian, but it is not Debian.  We don't and cannot know what changes were made by your distribution (compare http://futurist.se/gldt/).  #debian only supports Debian and pure <blend>s; please respect our choice to volunteer here to help Debian users.  Support for other distributions is off-topic on #debian, even if your own distro's channel is clueless or non-existent.
[00:04:31] <sney> you'll have to ask their support
[00:04:58] <bae> They have a new version out based on 11
[00:05:30] <bae> dpkg You type amazingly fast.
[00:05:31] <dpkg> I resemble that remark!
[00:05:33] <sney> then follow pardus's instructions to upgrade to the new pardus, and ucblogo 6.2 will be available through your package manager

[00:07:57] <sney> #debian's policy for over 20 years has been to only support debian, but I guess if some rando says it's ok to change, who are we to say
[00:08:37] <sney> seriously: pardus would not have bothered making a new distro if they were going to change nothing. so pardus is different from debian, and it's irresponsible for #debian to support pardus. so we don't, same as we didn't support knoppix or whatever in the early 00s.
[00:08:38] <bae> Pardus is produced primarily for the Turkish military.
[00:08:45] <Mr_Queue> It's always XY problem.. Someone add that to a bot.

[03:38:30] <somiaj> Khepra: packages in debian must be able to be built using only tools in debian without downloading anything else
[03:38:49] <somiaj> contrib/non-free can be slightly lax on this
[03:38:55] <Khepra> yea because I just installe ttf-mscorefonts-installer, and naturally it downloaded the fonts from sourceforge, the package being an "installer"
[03:39:16] <Khepra> (and then there's the steam client)  ...   right, so the build must be tight and sandboxed.
[03:39:24] <somiaj> I don't think anything in main can download something during the install, contrib does this a bunch, but that is because contrib can depend on non-free stuff which may be distributed by a third party

[05:11:54] <Khepra> EvanCarroll: well, systemd is not just init. init is a small part of it. systemd is the middleware between the kernel and the userland. it's a process manager and collection of tools, plumbing for the OS.
[05:12:21] <Khepra> so any and all policies that govern systemd in Debian are about all that, not just pid1.
[05:12:32] <EvanCarroll> Khepra: I realize that. (it should have been evident that I knew it was not _just_ init, as I said *outside* of the init system)
[05:13:44] <EvanCarroll> Khepra: that's not true.
[05:13:46] <EvanCarroll> https://www.debian.org/vote/2019/vote_002
[05:13:53] <EvanCarroll> Literally "Init systems and systemd"
[05:14:11] <EvanCarroll> that's the only resoution that I found on systemd, which is why I asked _outside_ of the init system, if there was a public stance.
[05:15:04] <Khepra> you'd have to be more precise about what you mean here.
[05:15:13] <Khepra> perhaps an example.
[05:16:00] <EvanCarroll> Does Debian have any plans to adopt the currently unimlemented parts of systemd, including homed, the locale system, the uefi bootloader, etc. etc. etc.
[05:16:04] <Khepra> also, the GR bags systemd in the same heap as "init systems", but that doesn't make it right. init is just a part of it, no matter the words used in the GR
[05:17:02] <Khepra> okay so your question is how much would Debian expand with the overall systemd ecosystem. I don't think there's a general policy set for homed, gummiboot^W systemd-boot, systemd-resolved, and others, still unused components
[05:17:30] *** Joins: c10l0 (~c10l@user/c10l)
[05:17:40] <EvanCarroll> The GR is very explictly init-specific., as I read it.
[05:18:00] <EvanCarroll> Khepra: exactly. ;)
[05:18:27] <EvanCarroll> Khepra: that's my question all the non-init stuff is there policy directing Debian moving forward as systemd spreads to other parts of the system.
[05:18:29] <Khepra> I doubt homed, for example, will not be included maybe in bookworm; but I DO think debian won't default to using it, as that would be a massive POLA violation
[05:18:30] <EvanCarroll> cool cool
[05:18:43] <EvanCarroll> POLA violation?
[05:18:51] <Khepra> Principle of Least Astonishment
[05:19:06] <EvanCarroll> Yeah, that's getting to the root of the question.
[05:19:14] <Khepra> systemd-homed is a massive POLA violation in that respect, and should be made very much optional and at explicit sysadmin discretion.
[05:19:37] <EvanCarroll> I would like to see Debian (or, my next distro) adopt systemd fully and I'm wondering whether or not this stuff is held up for a lack of work, or a lack of political acceptance.
[05:20:19] <Khepra> in general, Debian doesn't easily adopt fads. the principle of !sns is ubiqitous in many aspects
[05:20:22] <Khepra> !sns
[05:20:22] <dpkg> Shiny New Shit Syndrome is a serious disorder, which usually breaks out into an epidemic every time something new is released.  If you have SNS, ask me about <backports> and <ssb>; these are better options than upgrading to <testing> because it is a <moving target>.
[05:20:57] <Khepra> thankfully these things could be made optional: there for those who want it, but not defaulted to.

[05:23:24] <Khepra> EvanCarroll: adopting systemd fully in service units is something I'd love to see, but the last GR and general consensus among maintainers is that's not gonna happen -- debian still supports the ability to use other inits, and thus doesn't default service configs to rely 100% on systemd

[05:40:13] <willow> curious to see if/how something like homed can handle the issue of syncing home dir contents.
[05:41:54] <willow> i have a set of core, not-very-volatile, mostly standard directories like "Documents", etc. that can be synced in near-real-time.  but many directories are not suitable for this.  they are frequently changing contents and would waste a lot of bandwidth for near-rt-syncing.

[05:42:53] <willow> but i find 'syncthing' invaluable for maintaining a decentralized home and rely on rsync to deal with special directories that aren't suitable for it.
[05:44:28] <EvanCarroll> willow: you would write it into the JSON User Identity file afaik.
[05:44:33] <EvanCarroll> it has a section for storage.
[05:44:40] <EvanCarroll> you can specify what mounts where in the user directory
[05:44:43] <EvanCarroll> https://systemd.io/USER_RECORD/
[05:45:15] <willow> for example if you're working on an android project you really don't want the code directory to waste resources trying to sync it in real time while you're still working on it.
[05:46:04] <willow> but directories like Documents, Music, Pictures, etc. work fine with syncthing
[05:46:48] <EvanCarroll> willow: did you see the link I provided?
[05:46:48] <willow> but if you're downloading things for example that's another instance where you would want to be able to suspend syncing

[07:12:39] <richard_> how does one disable the Nouveau in debian
[07:13:00] <somiaj> richard_: why do you want to disable it?
[07:13:04] <richard_> you blacklist it
[07:13:24] <somiaj> sounds like an XY problem, what is it you are trying to do and why?
[07:13:50] <richard_> i want to use the .run driver
[07:14:04] <sney> !why nvidia installer sucks
[07:14:04] <dpkg> nvidia-installer works fine for you today, granted.  Let's say tomorrow Xorg is updated -- the nvidia driver will break.  If you try to uninstall nvidia (nvidia-installer --uninstall), then you break Xorg badly.  nvidia-installer overwrites files at random, and has NO CONCEPT of package management.  We recommend against using it based on extensive experience.  USE THE DEBIAN PACKAGES.  Ask me about <nvidia>.
[07:14:07] <somiaj> Don't do that, install the debian packages from non-free
[07:14:20] <somiaj> and those packages will blacklist the nouveau module for you
[07:16:04] <richard_> debian dont have the the latest driver though
[07:16:42] <somiaj> and? The driver in debian should be fine, and newer ones will come from backports
[07:17:27] <richard_> not for 5.14.6 it dont work comes up with error
[07:17:44] <somiaj> well debian doesn't even have that kernel either
[07:18:06] <somiaj> or are you running testing/sid?
[07:18:11] <richard_> thats why i need the .run driver
[07:18:44] <richard_> sid
[07:19:17] <somiaj> you might just need to use the 5.10 kernel until the newer package makes it into sid
[07:19:30] <somiaj> this is part of life in sid, and you should be asking for support in #debian-next on irc.oftc.net
[07:19:33] <somiaj> ,kernels
[07:19:34] <judd> Available kernel versions are: experimental: 5.14.0-trunk-686-pae (5.14.3-1~exp1); sid: 5.10.0-8-686 (5.10.46-4); bullseye: 5.10.0-8-686 (5.10.46-4); buster-backports: 5.10.0-0.bpo.8-686 (5.10.46-4~bpo10+1); buster: 4.19.0-17-686-pae (4.19.194-3); stretch-backports: 4.19.0-0.bpo.9-686-pae (4.19.118-2+deb10u1~bpo9+1); stretch: 4.19.0-0.bpo.17-686-pae (4.19.194-3~deb9u1); jessie-backports:
[07:19:35] <judd> 4.9.0-0.bpo.6-686-pae (4.9.88-1+deb9u1~bpo8+1); jessie: 4.9.0-0.bpo.12-686 (4.9.210-1+deb9u1~deb8u1); bookworm: 5.10.0-8-686 (5.10.46-4); bullseye-backports: 5.10.0-8-686 (5.10.46-4)
[07:19:48] <somiaj> though looks like 5.14 hasn't made it into sid either
[07:19:52] <somiaj> ,v nvidia-kernel-dkms
[07:19:53] <judd> Package: nvidia-kernel-dkms on amd64 -- stretch-proposed-updates/non-free: 390.132-1; stretch/non-free: 390.138-1; stretch-backports/non-free: 418.74-1~bpo9+1; buster/non-free: 418.197.02-1; buster-proposed-updates/non-free: 418.211.00-1; buster-backports/non-free: 460.73.01-1~bpo10+1; bullseye/non-free: 460.91.03-1; bookworm/non-free: 470.57.02-2; sid/non-free: 470.57.02-2
[07:20:19] <richard_> yeah it has but the nvidia driver fails
[07:20:21] <somiaj> So the 470 driver wont' compile against the 5.14 kernel in experiemntail?
[07:21:24] <somiaj> in this case I would just stick with the 5.10 kernel until the newer driver makes it into debian, the upstream .run file will just mess things up and not be worth the hassle, since sid updates so much you'll end up possibly breaking your system anyways
[07:21:27] <richard_> i need the driver linuxmint has for nvidia
[07:22:32] <richard_> its 470.63 driver

[07:23:38] <somiaj> Anyways, just wait, sometimes that is life in sid.
[07:23:57] <somiaj> you might be able to check out the salsa page for the nvidia driver, maybe they have something there you could compile yourself.
[07:23:59] <richard_> yeah
[07:25:19] <tjcarter> somiaj: 5.14 dropped in sid on amd64 but the indep packages that'd make it a default install haven't made it yet.
[07:25:44] <somiaj> but since you are running sid I think you can figure out how to black list a module, but for your actual issue, I would strongly advise against doing what you are doing
[07:26:18] <somiaj> tjcarter: ahh okay, I don't run sid anymore, I got too old and lazy
[07:28:19] <sney> yep, uploaded today
[07:28:23] <richard_> yeah i might brake my system
[07:28:41] <sney> just be patient, it will all be available sometime this week probably
[07:29:08] <sney> also, for accurate testing/sid support, without having people assume you are on bullseye, you should go to #debian-next on OFTC (note, right now you are on libera)

[07:38:40] <tjcarter> the installer did not make things easy here 😞 …but I think maybe I did that to myself insisting on some stuff that's kinda supported only in one standard config which I am not running.

[09:32:39] <tjcarter> the danger there is that some things should remain aliases

[09:33:02] <tjcarter> you do not want ls in your path defaulting to -F --color=auto
[09:33:22] <tjcarter> The -F alone will break stuff
[09:33:35] <Rodon> actually i did the same for many commands to be using in dwm...the same way..as you just told..
[09:34:38] <Rodon> ok
[09:34:55] <Rodon> mpc next && notify-send "🎵🎸Now Playing" "$(mpc current)"
[09:35:31] <Rodon> its second line after  !/bin/dash
[09:36:15] <Rodon> i did this trick.since putting long command was difficult in config ..
[09:36:41] <tjcarter> if you're only going to run it from a WM, you can put it in a dir not in your path
[09:37:18] <Rodon> no ...only for nnn file manager..
[09:37:29] <Rodon> dwm all perfect..
[09:38:29] <Rodon> nnn has a promt to type any command..but it doent take aliases..since its non-interactive shell

[13:19:35] <Khepra> I'm really baffled by packaging policies in debian sometimes. So, swaylock was kicked out of testing just a MONTH before Bullseye release, because a serious bug was found of "you had one job" type, that affected a subset of functionality. And now? Now debian has NO way to lock sway for the next two-three years.
[13:20:32] <Khepra> Debian really needs a separate category of packages that are still installable but a big red warning or something, for those users who would be affected. Because really....    Now. Sway. Can't. Lock. At. All.
[13:22:09] <ansgar> Khepra: The bug says it doesn't lock with swaylock either ;-)
[13:22:45] <Khepra> the bug actually happens in a subset of situations, like resuming from suspend, according to the upstream issue
[13:23:15] <Khepra> fine, yes, it's a grave bug. but now there's no locking at all for sway in Bullseye, for the lifetime of bullseye.
[13:24:41] *** Joins: tesseract (~tesseract@user/tesseract)
[13:24:44] <PMT> Well, upstream still hasn't fixed it. So that would be a start.

[13:25:56] *** Joins: nicoz (~nicoz@user/nicoz)
[13:26:01] <Khepra> My point is, when this gets fixed, it won't return to bullseye. that's why I think packages need a whole separate category for situations like this

[13:28:52] <ansgar> Khepra: The sway package maintainers don't seem to consider screen locking essential (sway doesn't depend or recommend swaylock; it does depend on swaybg, i.e., setting a wallpaper is essential)
[13:29:16] <PMT> that's...a stance.
[13:29:35] <Khepra> PMT: it wasn't shipped, sway is new thing in bullseye

[16:18:11] <Khepra> i'd recommend you used an ipset, but default should work
[16:19:17] <Khepra> aminvakil: also... "24hours"  I don't know if that's valid phrase,   "24h" is tho; and that findtime seems extreme
[16:20:01] <Khepra> for starters, just to test this, I'd put findtime to a much shorter period, say 1 minute . then do a few tests so 3 retries in 1 minute trigger teh banaction
[16:20:03] <aminvakil> ah, maybe "24hours" is my problem, i've changed it to "24h" now, and findtime is just for testing, i will reduce its

[16:21:20] <Khepra> so teh fail2ban.log should show   Found <yourip>  and after 3 attempts, more or less, it should log a "Ban". then it depends where in your iptables sits the fail2ban chain, iirc by default it shoves itself at the very beginning of INPUT chain with -I
[16:22:02] <aminvakil> ok, i've changed it to https://paste.debian.net/1212496/ and i'm doing `while true; do curl -Is https://example.org; done` from another server
[16:22:04] <Khepra> even so, I'd really recommend ipsets. this way you're opening yourself to an easy DoS, as each rule inserted is traversed for EACH PACKET, which is a big performance hog, even for something as fast as packet filter

[16:23:52] <aminvakil> may i ask how long does it take for fail2ban to scan logs?
[16:24:27] <Khepra> oh wait... I see. the jail is using systemd backend, and it should not use that, but backend = pynotify, if you have logpath=
[16:24:48] <aminvakil> i was wondering the same, should i install pynotify then?
[16:25:28] <Khepra> I'd check the docs first, I'm not 100% sure that using logpath forces a specific mechanism internally.   the systemd backend is really journald backend and I've found that to be rather very lacking with fail2ban

[17:27:01] <bandit_za> Khepra you might be right, I'm not really experienced with the subtleties
[17:27:12] <bandit_za> Khepra which log would you like to  >> see << ?
[17:27:32] <Khepra> first explain what is the PROBLEM you're haivng.   you do X and Z happens instead of Y
[17:27:40] <bandit_za> Khepra: "www.bodyarchitect.co.za has a security policy called HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which means that Firefox can only connect to it securely. You can’t add an exception to visit this site." <---- in firefox
[17:27:54] <bandit_za> whoops, just exposed my domain, anyways
[17:28:14] <Khepra> okay, yes. so, you've renewed the LE cert, and it has a valid one again. that complaint by FF should be gone.
[17:28:36] <Khepra> HSTS prevents browsers to add exceptions for invalid certs, that is true. renewing the cert fixes that.
[17:29:09] <bandit_za> Khepra my understanding is that only one cert will be accepted for HSTS and not others. is that pinning
[17:29:18] <Khepra> (also I don't know if clearing the browser cache thoroughly (all the options) would clear the HSTS settings in them for that domain)
[17:29:27] <Khepra> bandit_za: that's pinning yes, not HSTS
[17:30:02] <Khepra> you "pin" a cert by tying it to a specific signature for a period. if you renew the cert, you get a new signature and browsers will refuse that. that's why HPKP is very dangerous unless you're very very very careful.
[17:30:12] <bandit_za> ok Khepra, thanks. next, i cleared the chrome HSTS cache but i'm getting a super weird page served by the cert authority
[17:30:28] <bandit_za> Website Unavailable
[17:30:28] <bandit_za> The website you are trying to reach is unavailable due to security measures in place which restrict unauthorized access.
[17:30:45] <bandit_za> this is a literal web page served by the cert authority instead of my own server
[17:30:58] <bandit_za> (chrome)
[17:31:04] <Khepra> do you have CAA on the domain?
[17:31:41] <bandit_za> is that a DNS record?

[17:54:18] <aminvakil> i've also tried disabling all the stuff in nginx.conf (sendfile, tcp_nopush, openfilecache, ...), but didn't help
[17:54:22] <Khepra> aminvakil: one thing I learned bout nginx backend proxying is that it's terrible and the working instance requires paid, commercial nginx.  as an example, having the processess QUEUE requests, like every normal decent http client would
[17:54:35] <Khepra> that said... do you need the proxy to touch the disk at all? big files involved?
[17:54:42] <aminvakil> yes
[17:55:33] <aminvakil> although i'm not sure how would that reduce performance and if that may hurt on traffic peak times
[17:55:38] <Khepra> I'd just leave it as is, nothing fancy. nginx already is aio, event based epoll C10k server.
[17:56:53] <aminvakil> right, thanks for your help! i will disable it after a day or two unless i found a reason for this behaviour
[17:58:18] <Khepra> I'd consider changing the defaults and forcing proxy optimizations only when you do approach C10k and io pipeline is already saturated with default (iirc in-kernel sendfile is used)
[17:59:27] <aminvakil> yes, they had high iowait before on peak times and they had threw everything at it trying to handle it
[18:00:11] <Khepra> I doubt iowait would be solved by aio.  aio solves cpu bound, single threads blocking on data being offloaded to the client, but wiht in-kernel sendfile that already _is_ nonblocking for teh userland

[21:51:28] <tjcarter> at least at this point it's pretty easy to turn an oracle VM into a qemu VM

[21:55:45] <tjcarter> ease of use, sort of.
[21:56:03] <tjcarter> that's rapidly becoming a non-issue too
[21:56:05] <sney> I remember there being a format that some vendors use to distribute applications that's supported exclusively by virtualbox and maybe also hyper-v?
[21:56:21] <sney> virt-manager has almost identical ease of use to virtualbox
[21:56:48] <tjcarter> sney: It's almost there, I'd agree.
[21:57:28] <sney> a couple of the menus are in non-obvious places, but it's a pretty shallow learning curve to switch
[21:57:37] <tjcarter> to the point I'd say vbox is no longer virt-manager's target … vmware is.
[21:57:40] <Khepra> shared folders can now be achieved by virtio-fs, 2D accel... is probably useless even on virtualbox. pci passthrough is possible (and requires non-free on vbox). have I missed anything?

[22:08:04] <tjcarter> That said, I'm still wondering if there's a "good" framebuffer terminal. The one that existed when I last looked didn't do things in a very compatible way for reasons that didn't/don't make sense.
[22:08:49] <Khepra> blackop: you can shush it up with   kernel.printk = 4 4 1 4     in sysctl.conf, and that page explains the numbers
[22:09:23] <Khepra> tjcarter: why tho, it's just a number

[22:13:28] <tjcarter> as for changing gdm back … why ever did it move from VT7 to VT1? It's just a number, right?
[22:14:01] <sney> VT7 is an X11 convention, so maybe it was to explicitly break from that?
[22:14:10] <jelly> tjcarter, there isn't.  It's literally faster to bring up X with a single fullscreen term of your choice than anything fb

[22:16:20] * tjcarter notes jelly has just illustrated the attitude in question
[22:16:43] <tjcarter> the attitude is that the Linux text console is somehow worthless or shouldn't exist in the modern age.
[22:17:12] <blackop> i see these lines in dmesg:

[22:17:19] <n4dir> i thought X11 runs on TTY one too (now)
[22:17:38] <blackop> this is happening when discord app is running i guess

[22:19:25] <Khepra> blackop: they are dmesg values.

[22:22:19] <jelly> tjcarter, fb console is, in general, unaccelerated crap.  You WILL have an easier time debugging things if you are able to ssh in and have a terminal that is reasonably fast and responsive.

[22:23:51] <Khepra> blackop: I would never advocate reducing security layers, but if this really annoys you that much, you can disable apparmor entirely. this is a bug in the snap, and snaps are full of those and you could file a bug report about it but don't hold your breath
[22:23:53] <tjcarter> jelly: legally blind, I physically can't see two monitors at once.
[22:24:20] <blackop> Khepra: how about flatpak?

[22:24:55] <tjcarter> jelly: that doesn't help for debugging X
[22:24:56] <Khepra> blackop: meanwhile, you can filter out from the kernel buffer what you need, without disabling apparmor. use journalctl.    journalctl -b -k  will give you dmesg since boot, and you can filter it with grep
[22:25:19] <tjcarter> jelly: since disconnecting your monitor tends to cause problems for X. It used to crash it.
[22:25:27] <tjcarter> back in the jesse days
[22:25:29] <Khepra> blackop: I have not much experience with flatpaks to recommend them over snaps. but yes, flatpaks don't use AA, they require selinux for that.
