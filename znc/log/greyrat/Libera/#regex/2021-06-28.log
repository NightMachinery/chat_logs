[00:00:08] <JohnDoe2> re101-zorse-970 no, you're trying to fix the headache by telling people to take Tylenol rather than telling them to assess whether they had water, or banged their head 2 minutes ago, or didn't eat, or whatever else is minor that causes a headache like indigestion...
[00:00:45] <JohnDoe2> same thing here: we don't need to alleviate the indentation, we need to fix what's causing it to go off in the first place
[00:00:46] <re101-zorse-970> No, I fix the cause first
[00:01:27] <JohnDoe2> so give that regex replacement a try on one of the files and see if that will align it properly.
[00:03:10] <JohnDoe2> Also, to save time in the future, you can copy what's inside style="" (the things that repeat) and put it inside your css files, call it something, then apply that class to the li items. For example <li style="color: green"></li> would become <li class="green"></li> and in your css file you have .green { color: green }  (the . in front of green
[00:03:10] <JohnDoe2> says it's a class name, and inside the  {} is whatever was inside style=""
[00:07:21] <re101-zorse-970> that will take time but I do understand css
[00:07:40] <re101-zorse-970> I just wanna replace that li
[00:08:12] <JohnDoe2> https://regex101.com/r/Wwu5Mg/5 doesn't force you to create css now
[00:08:21] <JohnDoe2> it just takes away the 2 thing that cause misalignment
[00:08:27] <JohnDoe2> things*
[00:08:31] <re101-zorse-970> What you gave me replaces my li with something else but I think you felt that that will align it better, right?
[00:09:02] <JohnDoe2> https://bugout.regex.ga/9ed6f7e794f6a941bf7d34ce3d69ff4b_the-actual-problem.png -- yes it should look perfectly aligned like it does in this screenshot
[00:09:44] <JohnDoe2> it replaces it with the same li, minus text-indent: 1.3em; and list-style-position: inside;
[00:13:52] <JohnDoe2> https://regex101.com/r/Wwu5Mg/6 that's how you could replace all same-style with a class name. Then just add what was inside style="" to your css file with .myClassName or whatever you call it
[00:16:03] <re101-zorse-970> yea, that's perfect
[00:16:12] <re101-zorse-970> better than what I had b4
[00:16:39] <JohnDoe2> even befive if you account for inflation. ðŸ˜†

[00:39:56] <re101-zorse-970> The `</span></td></tr></tbody></table>` is preceded by some text which should be found but not replaced
[00:41:30] <re101-zorse-970> Rather, it is not there now but should be added just before the next hyphen
[00:42:03] <re101-zorse-970> All the searching should stop at the first `</table>`
[00:43:20] <re101-zorse-970> .....and start with the first hyphen since I will be opening and editing each file
[00:44:13] <re101-zorse-970> .....and I can choose the starting point
[00:47:49] <JohnDoe2> yikes.
[00:49:00] <JohnDoe2> ok so it's definitely not all 40, there's hyphen in `sans-serif` but you don't want to touch that
[00:49:09] <re101-zorse-970> yea
[00:49:46] <re101-zorse-970> Like I said, I can choose where to start
[00:51:18] <JohnDoe2> ok so rather than repeating the gruesome 2 hour session to understand what you want, let's have you fill out the following: https://regex101.com/r/V4Pp6o/2 re101-zorse-970

[01:21:06] <re101-zorse-970> It's essentially to indent everything from the 2nd line so as to not appear below the hyphen
[01:22:16] <JohnDoe2> there has to be a mistake there, where you normally have - Cold-water feeling you replace the - between Cold and water with a table to indent stuff
[01:22:22] <JohnDoe2> Doubt that's what you wanted
[01:23:17] <re101-zorse-970> right, it should skip the hyphen between cold and water

[01:29:51] <re101-zorse-970> that is supposed to be indented without a hyphen before it
[01:30:22] <JohnDoe2> re101-zorse-970 so your "i have this" has dashes before every single item, starting with -Suited to women with uterine
[01:30:54] <re101-zorse-970> ...but not on every line

[01:31:31] <JohnDoe2> right so then I'll have to ignore the thing you pasted. Now, looking at your site URL what needs to be indented?
[01:32:12] <re101-zorse-970> I used npp to replace but I think you get the point

[01:33:14] <JohnDoe2> yes, that's what I'm looking at. So which ones are supposed to get indented?
[01:35:06] <re101-zorse-970> For example, `Suited to women with uterine displacements, probably due to defective nutrition and debility (where prolapsus uteri is a symptom of general defective nutrition with little or no local congestion).` should have a text indent in such a way that the 2nd line should come below where the first starts but after the hyphen

[01:45:10] <JohnDoe2> re101-crane-11 regex can only do one replacement, although it can match multiple things. I would use string functions in whatever language you're doing this, split by / and then build your resulting string as you wish using string concatenation

[09:25:08] *** Quits: army (~aL@user/army) (Quit: Going offline, see ya! (www.adiirc.com))
[09:25:33] <digitok> \b is a zero-width assertion which matches between a word char (a-zA-Z0-9_) and a non-word char
[09:26:13] <digitok> so, /a\b/ matches "a" if it is not followed by another char which is a-zA-Z0-9_
[09:26:33] <digitok> and /@\b/ matches @ if it is followed by a char which is a-zA-Z0-9_
[09:27:01] <digitok> start/end of strings/lines would also be considered a boundary for a word char
[09:29:39] <digitok> the most common use of \b is to match whole words, i.e. prevent matching partial words

[18:01:10] <DrowningElysium> digitok: Yes

[19:15:16] <dka> https://regex101.com/r/IPQuGK/1
[19:15:26] <dka> Hi, I want to pick all the .web. but I can never get the right regex
[19:15:38] <re101-adelie-32> okay
[19:15:39] <re101-adelie-32> ^AWDWRaxaBulkPrint-[0-9]{8}_[0-9]{2}-.+.pdf$&^AWDWRaxaBulkPrint-[0-9]{8}_[0-9]{2}-.+.xml$
[19:15:55] <re101-adelie-32> need both the regex to get satisfied
[19:16:12] <digitok> dka, https://regex101.com/r/IPQuGK/2
[19:16:47] <digitok> re101-adelie-32, ok?
[19:16:58] <digitok> not sure what you're asking
[19:17:42] <re101-adelie-32> i need 2 regex to be validated with and conditon
[19:17:44] <digitok> varazir, slight edit, the above should be "^(?:\d{2})?(\d{2})(\d{4})-?(\d{4})$"
[19:17:52] <varazir> digitok: thanks I'll test it and get back :) thanks again for the best support channel :) 
[19:17:57] <digitok> yw :)
[19:18:04] <re101-adelie-32> okay, plss let me know
[19:18:28] <dka> digitok, https://regex101.com/r/ktXIlV/1 same issue here except I want to get the native ios and android test
[19:18:50] <digitok> re101-adelie-32, how? one regex requires the string to end with ".pdf" and the other requires it to end with ".xml"
[19:19:11] <re101-adelie-32> yes, correct
[19:19:30] <digitok> so how can both match the same string
[19:19:31] <re101-adelie-32> if both regex finds then it needs to be success else fail
[19:20:06] <dka> digitok, you didnt pick the 1st two lines https://regex101.com/r/IPQuGK/2
[19:20:31] <karhunkynsi> ^AWDWRaxaBulkPrint-[0-9]{8}_[0-9]{2}-.+\.(pdf|xml)$  i guess
[19:20:32] <digitok> they don't contain .web
[19:20:38] <dka> but they should be picked
[19:20:45] <digitok> karhunkynsi, lol probably
[19:20:48] <dka> because they are global tests, that work for all env
[19:22:06] <re101-adelie-32> ^AWDWRaxaBulkPrint-[0-9]{8}_[0-9]{2}-.+\.(pdf|xml)$  -- this uses or condition
[19:22:14] <re101-adelie-32> i need and for the above
[19:22:25] <re101-adelie-32> and logical condition
[19:22:42] <karhunkynsi> A string can't both end in ".pdf" AND ".xml".
[19:23:00] <digitok> dka, is this not what you want for the other one? https://regex101.com/r/ktXIlV/2
[19:23:05] <digitok> i'm sure we did this the other day
[19:24:02] <dka> digitok, this one should also include the first two test as they are global
[19:24:21] <digitok> ok, but are theher matches correct
[19:24:23] <dka> yes but the other day, the extension was before the extension, now it is before test.ext
[19:24:24] <digitok> the other*
[19:25:07] <dka> .test.tsx? without extension (.native|.web|.ios|.android) should always be picked
[19:27:34] <digitok> i see
[19:27:56] <digitok> so basically you just want one regex for .web and one for anything else?
[19:28:21] <dka> yes
[19:28:34] <dka> but web include also .test.tsx that are not prefixed
[19:28:45] <digitok> ok
[19:29:36] <digitok> do you know if you're using ES6?

[20:03:24] <digitok> re101-adelie-32, what does your data look like? is it a string with multiple lines containing filenames?
[20:04:16] *** Parts: DrowningElysium (sid190788@user/drowningelysium) ()
[20:05:51] <re101-adelie-32> actually there will be different files with PDF and XML format
[20:06:33] <re101-adelie-32> if both extension files are present with same file name pattern then we need to move the files to another folder
[20:06:44] <re101-adelie-32> if any of the file is missing we need to fail the process
[20:07:18] <digitok> it sounds like this isn't a regex issue
[20:07:48] <digitok> regex can only see the text/string that you're comparing it to
[20:08:01] <digitok> which in your case i assume is a single filename
[20:08:23] <re101-adelie-32> no it is two files one with pdf and one with xml extension
[20:09:03] <digitok> show me the single line of code that your regex is on
[20:10:37] <re101-adelie-32> we are using script to pick the regular expression
[20:11:14] <re101-adelie-32> based on the regular expression the files will be picked/failed
[20:11:25] <digitok> exactly
[20:11:35] <digitok> so the regex is being compared to one file at a time
[20:11:52] <digitok> there's no way for the regex to know if another file exists
[20:12:07] <digitok> you have a script/code issue, not a regex issue
[20:12:08] <re101-adelie-32> hmm okay
[20:12:26] <re101-adelie-32> can't we use and command in our regex like how we use or?
[20:12:48] <digitok> it doesn't matter
[20:13:18] <re101-adelie-32> okay
[20:13:41] <digitok> if your script is checking the regex against one file name at a time
[20:13:56] <digitok> then there is only one file the regex can see

[22:34:58] <OnlineCop> If it's simply "too much work for us to dig into," then that would be one thing. Maybe I could even help out with that (free time? me?). If it's "that could cause too many breakages for legacy code," it's more of a valid argument.
[22:38:14] <NiLon> could be both
