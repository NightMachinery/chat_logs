[01:15:27] <somiaj> GameRetro: not really, it just sets up some files in etc so the computer thinks it is that domain.

[01:15:37] <Khepra> GameRetro: no
[01:15:59] <somiaj> GameRetro: you can adjust later if needed, but basically this determines if you want your computer to think it is hostname.mydomainname.com or similar
[01:16:16] <GameRetro> Thanks somiaj - follow up - if I plan to use this debian install as a home server and actually use that exact domain to point to it - will setting it as domain at install make a difference at all?
[01:16:28] <sussudio> curmudgeon: from googling, i'm getting confusing results about "profile 77" meaning you haven't "set a profile", whatever that means.
[01:16:33] <GameRetro> ah somiaj I see!!!
[01:16:45] <somiaj> GameRetro: again not really. It may make things a little easier in the long run is all. All of this is editable after the effect in /etc
[01:16:54] <somiaj> GameRetro: it sets that name in a few locations you can change later.
[01:17:07] *** dirty_pipe is now known as ddsys
[01:17:10] <GameRetro> so it's just a descriptive way to say this is computerA on that domain, and it's an internal way to make a relationship between different computers on the network

I understand this might involve port forwarding and network configurations too, so that's why I think I need a good guide. I am

[01:35:52] <GameRetro> what firewall package will it install? also apache or nginx?
[01:36:32] <kee> GameRetro: It doesn't install a firewall, iirc.
[01:36:35] <GameRetro> kee man you have no idea how amazing this all is for me since I dreaded configuring ports and rules on the machine haha
[01:36:48] <kee> You'll still have to, if you want a firewall.
[01:37:00] <kee> It's a lot easier than Windows, but it's not perfect.
[01:37:13] <kee> Your router should be a good enough firewall, though.
[01:37:40] <GameRetro> yeah for sure - man i just don't want anything blocking any ports
[01:37:46] <GameRetro> cause I am suspicious my ISP may be blocking some
[01:37:58] <GameRetro> so at the moment i want the least amount of things to check for accessing the server via public IP
[01:37:59] <kee> Can't do anything about your ISP, but Debian doesn't block ports by default.
[01:38:15] <GameRetro> once I get to the html page via outside IP i can then think about firewalls IF and only IF I need them later on
[01:38:23] <kee> You can even listen on every port at once! (Requires sudo, and also requires killing the other processes that are trying to listen on ports.)
[01:38:30] <GameRetro> kee sweet - yeah! i just wanna eliminate potential issues
[01:38:36] <GameRetro> and if there's a problem in the end I'll know it's isp
[01:38:43] <kee> Or your router is misconfigured.
[01:38:46] <GameRetro> OH WOW!!!
[01:39:02] <GameRetro> yeah for sure, router will be first step to test - but I mean - I can always use local ip's to test router stuff right?
[01:39:07] <kee> Nope.
[01:39:17] <GameRetro> if i ping the machine local IP via a different machine on the network on a certain port?

[01:39:38] <kee> The router is the thing in between your local network and the wider world.
[01:39:56] <kee> The switch connects up all your devices on your local network. (It's like an old-fashioned telephone switchboard.)
[01:40:14] <kee> Nowadays it's one box that does both jobs, but the "router settings" part is only for the router bit.

[01:41:09] <GameRetro> mhm, so baby steps - i first finish installing Debian with web server and SSH (and standard system utilities?)
[01:41:17] <kee> Yeah.
[01:41:18] <GameRetro> this makes a debian install with no blocks on ports or whatnot
[01:41:28] <GameRetro> so the "server" machine is not a suspect
[01:41:30] <kee> It will also serve a default page on the web server.
[01:41:35] <GameRetro> nice!
[01:41:43] <GameRetro> man I start loving debian more and more :D
[01:41:44] <kee> Simultaneously, you can check your router's webpage-settings thing on another device.
[01:41:57] <kee> Maybe look up a tutorial for how to forward ports?
[01:42:03] <GameRetro> the router isn't an openwrt one
[01:42:14] <GameRetro> but it's running a fork of openwrt - it's a xiaomi device
[01:42:17] <kee> There are tutorials for most routers anyway.
[01:42:24] <kee> If it's an openwrt fork, you're probably fine.
[01:42:28] <kee> I do have to go now, but if you happen not to find other helpful people here (unlikely, but maybe they're all asleep or away), you might try #networking.
[01:42:29] <GameRetro> and I already have it setup to forward ports 80, 8080, 443 and 9443
[01:42:36] <kee> Forward from what device?
[01:42:53] <GameRetro> external ports to a static local IP's internal same number ports
[01:42:57] <kee> You can't just "forward". That's why we have forwarding in the first place.
[01:43:08] <kee> You need to connect the local end to a specific computer's ports.
[01:43:18] <GameRetro> yes, i have a static IP chosen
[01:43:24] <kee> Oh, okay. That should work, then.
[01:43:26] <GameRetro> and tied to the MAC address of the machine
[01:43:45] <kee> In which case, you shuold have no problems when you boot Debian for the first time.
[01:43:50] <GameRetro> so the router will always make sure that IP is assigned to this machine
[01:43:53] <Awaru> ok so noone idea how to get my fingerprint
[01:43:54] <Awaru> ?
[01:44:02] <kee> Though I'd try maybe some silly port like 5678, just in case the ISP blocks the standard ones.
[01:44:16] <GameRetro> gotcha! i'll try a few random ones
[01:44:18] <kee> Awaru: What do you mean by fingerprint?
[01:44:26] <GameRetro> and if it fails I'll ask for help on networking channel on how to test for any open ports
[01:44:27] <karlpinc> GameRetro: Your choice to have dhcp hand out IP addresses based on MAC addresses can often be the "right way" to manage your local address space.
[01:44:30] <GameRetro> or what else to do
[01:44:37] <kee> Awaru: Your public key, or the hex string that normally gets called a fingerprint, or the graphical version?

[01:46:12] <GameRetro> karlpinc thanks (i guess?) - i set up static local ips on the router level based on MAC for most the devices that I could... shame the repeater for the second floor changes MAC address (apparently by googling it - it seems this is common) so I can't tie it down to a static IP (the repeater mode settings don't allow you to pick an IP on that end
[01:46:12] <GameRetro> either)
[01:46:52] <kee> GameRetro: If it's the only device like that, you could shrink your DHCP address space to 1 IP.

[02:23:19] <GameRetro> so it's like a table where you add commands that are allowed to... but if i were to just install it it has no rules in it
[02:23:22] <GameRetro> so it's pointless right?
[02:23:23] <sney> it also doesn't mean you need to have a root password, which can be a good idea in some environments
[02:23:28] <GameRetro> and if i'm the only user again pointless
[02:23:48] <sney> if you don't see the point of sudo on your own system then you can certainly make the choice not to use it
[02:24:18] <GameRetro> well for the time being all i've used it for is sudo su - which logged me as root
[02:24:26] <GameRetro> which i can do with just "su"

[02:24:38] <GameRetro> and such
[02:24:44] <sney> yes, it's good to unlearn that "sudo su" ubuntu habit :)
[02:24:44] <GameRetro> and sudo systemctl... etc

[02:25:07] <GameRetro> but i think i am actually LOVING debian
[02:25:16] <GameRetro> i like keeping things simpler where possible
[02:25:28] <GameRetro> and ofc if i need something complex learning the correct way
[02:25:59] <sney> if you have a root password that's easy for you to remember and type on demand, then that may be something of a vulnerability for you. but of course you can mitigate this in other ways

[02:26:13] <sney> and sudo isn't inherently more secure either

[05:33:24] <ar324> Why should that be necessary if I've set the option to 'Never'? Is it a bug?
[05:33:31] <jmcnaught> ar324: on most Debian systems this runs because of apt-daily.timer which calls apt-daily.service (which calls a script, "systemctl cat apt-daily.service".  It has ConditionACPower=true so at least it will not run on battery.
[05:34:51] <ar324> Ah, so is it independent of the DE?
[05:35:23] <ar324> GNOME Software is not initiating the update, right?
[05:35:27] <jmcnaught> ar324: yes, I think in GNOME's Software and Updates you are disabling something else that can also update.
[05:35:52] <jmcnaught> But GNOME Software is probably still noticing that updates are available, even though it did not trigger the update itself.

[05:38:19] <ar324> Yeah, that makes sense. I also see apt-daily-upgrade.service (and .timer). Can I just disable them by doing 'systemctl disable ...'?
[05:40:13] <jmcnaught> That's probably fine too, I've never bothered to disable it.
[05:40:40] <ar324> Okay. Thanks for your help!

So I run gpg --recv-keys 5E3C45D7B312C643 and it complains that the key has no user ID and skips it. I don't see an option to avoid skipping keys without user IDs. What am I missing here?

[15:20:43] <dminuoso> Hi. Im on a Cumulus Linux, which essentially is just a debian derivate. My question is this:
[15:21:23] <dminuoso> Im on a Cumulus Linux Switch which has internet connectivity only in a particular vrf `mgmt`. However, commands like `apt-get` appear to have internet connectivity as usual.
[15:21:30] <dminuoso> `apt-get` is not a shell wrapper around `ip vrf exec`.
[15:21:42] <dminuoso> How can this be? Does apt have some mechanism to configure a VRF?

[15:25:58] <kjetilho> dminuoso: aren't you running it as root?
[15:26:05] <Khepra> !based on debian
[15:26:06] <dpkg> Your distribution may be based on and have software in common with Debian, but it is not Debian.  We don't and cannot know what changes were made by your distribution (compare http://futurist.se/gldt/).  #debian only supports Debian and pure <blend>s; please respect our choice to volunteer here to help Debian users.  Support for other distributions is off-topic on #debian, even if your own distro's channel is clueless or non-existent.

[15:26:55] <dminuoso> Khepra: Sure, Im just looking for ways this could physically be implemented.
[15:27:10] <Khepra> yeah but we can't know the answer.
[15:27:32] <Khepra> can you reproduce the problem in debian?
[15:27:42] <kjetilho> unless there happens to be a Cumulus user present.  but it's off-topic of course

[15:28:14] <dminuoso> Mmm, so it occured to me that the current vrf of the interactive bash shell might be in `mgmt` vrf, and `ip vrf identify` confirms this.
[15:28:26] <dminuoso> kjetilho: Yes, the sshd runs in the mgmt vrf
[15:28:34] <dminuoso> Would ssh give me a shell inside that same vrf?

[19:14:40] *** Joins: timahvo1 (~rogue@41.80.98.69)

[19:14:41] <Khepra> johnjaye: but what's your real question then? if you restart netowkring.service, that basically only does   ifdown + ifup
[19:15:07] <karlpinc> neilthereildeil: chroot can be used to access the environment installed by debootstrap.  (See: man debootstrap)  But it is not a requirement.
[19:15:09] <Khepra> neilthereildeil: that's the systemd-nspawn, it does more than just a chroot, it prepares other things
[19:15:14] <johnjaye> i was confused what i was supposed to restart that's all
[19:15:22] <johnjaye> since there's multiple targets referring to networking
[19:15:34] <Khepra> neilthereildeil: in this particular case, like I said, you can use nspawn or any of the containerization tools you'd like. even chroot is okay if you know how to prepare it

[20:04:05] <sney> !bullseye-security
[20:04:05] <dpkg> The repository name for <security> updates has changed between buster and bullseye.  Now it is: "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main". You should also have a line for <stable-updates>. See <sources.list> <bullseye/updates>. Note that you may need to adjust the Default-Release and pinning settings to match this change.
[20:04:21] <jelly> Henry151, which debian release are you supposed to have installed?
[20:05:02] <jelly> I'm asking because using "stable" in repo configuration is HORRIBLY unsafe

[20:08:29] <Henry151> https://termbin.com/hj4e
[20:08:43] <jelly> it _seems_ you're supposed to have a debian 10, "buster" installation, but using "stable" might have resulted in you having a mix of debian 10 and 11

[20:09:04] <Henry151> there's the outputs of those two commands
[20:09:20] <jelly> using a specific codename instead of "stable" in repos avoids the unexpected partial upgrade of stuff to newer debian

[20:09:38] <jelly> right, it's a mess already
[20:09:52] <jelly> you have base-files from debian 11 and libc6 from debian 10
[20:10:04] <jelly> do this:
[20:10:11] <jelly> dpkg, buster->bullseye
[20:10:11] <dpkg> Read (at least) the upgrading chapter of <release notes> https://deb.li/39cyD . TL;DR: In /etc/apt/sources.list change "buster" to "bullseye", fix the line for security updates (see <bullseye-security>), remove stable-specific lines like buster-backports. apt update && apt upgrade --no-new-pkgs && apt full-upgrade. 3rd party repos like <dmo> cause problems with upgrades. If working over ssh, upgrade ssh first, see <bullseye ssh upgrade>.

[20:20:50] <dpkg> To get a list of packages you have installed now, that are not available from any repository in your sources.list: aptitude search '?narrow(?not(?archive("^[^n][^o].*$")),?version(CURRENT))'
[20:20:59] *** Joins: k8yun (~k8yun@user/k8yun)
[20:21:02] <johnjaye> something like echo `date` " This is a change " >> /root/myhistory.log
[20:21:24] <jelly> Henry151, you'll need to have aptitude installed to do that ^
[20:21:36] <johnjaye> another possibility is to save backup files everywhere
[20:22:17] <jelly> I like to run upgrade commands inside "script"
[20:22:20] <johnjaye> like if you edit /etc/network/interfaces copy the old one to /etc/network/interfaces.old
[20:22:20] <Henry151> i have aptitude installed, but i just jumped the gun, i updated my source.list and pulled the trigger, it did the apt update successfully and did the apt upgrade successfully, from the look of it
[20:22:30] <Henry151> i think it all worked
[20:22:35] <Henry151> gonna reboot the system to be sure
[20:23:15] <jelly> Henry151, what do you mean by "apt upgrade"?
[20:23:22] *** Quits: Haudegen (~quassel@91.114.49.10) (Quit: Bin weg.)
[20:23:27] <Henry151> i have nightly backups of the entire system, only excluding specific large media files (using tarsnap, and then backing up the large media files using a backblaze repo)
[20:23:31] <jelly> Henry151, the docs say to run, roughly, apt update && apt upgrade --no-new-pkgs && apt full-upgrade.
[20:24:38] * Henry151 is chagrined
[20:24:42] <Henry151> thanks jelly
[20:24:46] <jelly> Henry151, and they say to run it under "script" so you have logs.  Apt can sometimes decide to remove more things than expected and if you're not reading its output carefully, logs help after the fact.
[20:25:32] <jelly> if you do things some other way they might break more than expected.

[20:26:46] <jelly> when we ask you to read the release notes, the implication is you're also going to FOLLOW THEM not just skim and do whatever
[20:26:57] <Henry151> ok well, i did them another way; but it looks like it is working. I just now did the apt upgrade --no-new-pkgs and then did the apt full-upgrade, and it looks like it worked relatively well, and i'll copy all the output and save it to a file in case i encounter problems and need to review the logs.
[20:27:22] <Henry151> you're right, sorry, i should have slowed down and been more careful
[20:27:23] <jelly> there's usually quite a bit of said output.
[20:28:02] <Henry151> i think i can scroll back up far enough in my terminal to copy it all
[20:28:16] <Henry151> i forget how i did it but i know i increased the length of available scrollback at one point
[20:28:16] <sney> and make sure you actually did put "bullseye" in sources.list as well
[20:28:26] <Henry151> yes, that i did

[23:34:12] <curmudgeon> hwinfo https://dpaste.com/9U6RMG8KS. check that tip alkisg :)
[23:34:51] <alkisg> curmudgeon: that's the next step, acpi; i'm talking about "verifying if something hangs shutdown" instead
[23:36:10] <curmudgeon> ya. well the computer does not use sudo. only su
[23:36:23] <curmudgeon> so sync; poweroff -f ?
