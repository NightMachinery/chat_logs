[02:35:05] <jkk> https://onionshare.org/ - who here is using it?
[02:44:15] <xx> jkk: someone probably is, do you have any question about it?
[02:45:27] <jkk> it can be used to publish an onion sites?
[02:45:55] <jkk> I was thinking how easy it is to make chats similar to this on an onion site so people can access it easily

[02:49:51] <asdfa> jkk: im on webchat over tor :/
[02:50:19] <asdfa> don't need for an onionsite :D
[02:50:53] <xx> jkk: yes, it can be used to publish an onion site
[02:51:00] <xx> it even has included chat functionality by default now
[02:51:11] <xx> don't think it is a group chat though but haven't tried
[02:51:42] <xx> asdfa: sadly libera webchat often blocks tor users without an account
[02:52:23] <jkk> xx if they have a group chat that would be awesome
[02:53:01] <jkk> I am pretty sure libera soon will start closing rooms saying it is against TOS etc
[02:53:08] <xx> they already have
[02:53:34] <xx> the server operators even interfered with op decisions in their own channels
[02:54:15] <xx> jkk: https://docs.onionshare.org/2.4/en/features.html#chat-anonymously
[02:54:19] <xx> looks like it is group chat
[02:55:24] <jkk> People can join the chat room by loading its OnionShare address in Tor Browser. The chat room requires JavasScript, so everyone who wants to participate must have their Tor Browser security level set to “Standard” or “Safer”, instead of “Safest”.
[02:55:43] <jkk> I have seen some chat rooms on onion that work via html
[02:55:57] <xx> so tell people to use a separate tor browser just for that
[02:56:05] <xx> one can have as many tor browsers as one wants
[02:58:47] <jkk> then they would depend on chat host good will not to fingerprint them via js..
[03:01:19] <xx> jkk: well then be the host yourself
[03:03:48] <jkk> xx,html 5 + php maybe to avoid js?
[03:06:04] <xx> you're much more likely going to get fingerprinted based on the information you reveal in the chat than through the JS
[03:07:00] <jkk> we are talking about multiple chat rooms and multiple users
[03:07:47] <jkk> js can fingerprint and compare with data from fb, linkedin, etc right?
[03:10:11] <jkk> maybe we can ask https://twitter.com/micahflee/ to help :)
[03:13:34] <xx> micah has not been very responsive for the past few years
[03:14:39] <jkk> it seems it is better to publish software anon if you choose to develop it
[03:14:58] <xx> well the precedent with that is the truecrypt devs
[03:19:41] <asdfa> rather than cloudflare
[03:21:27] <jkk> also did anyone published a telegram desktop version with secure chats enabled...
[03:21:35] <jkk> or telegram blocks it somehow
[03:21:51] <asdfa> try signal
[03:21:54] <jkk> telegram - no secure chats on the desktop - clearly aimed to profile people via phones
[03:21:55] <asdfa> :/
[03:22:11] <asdfa> or briar, it runs over tor
[03:22:36] <jkk> or a desktop app + a phone that never have seen a sim card linked to a busy wifi spot?
