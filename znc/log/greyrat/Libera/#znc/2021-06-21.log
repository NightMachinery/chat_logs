[01:30:20] <Casper> Yeah, boost is a tricky one to find.
[01:48:13] <PeGaSuS> still, it's funny because usually I try to install system wide all the libs that a certain software needs
[01:49:00] <DarthGandalf> PeGaSuS: do you actually use i18n?
[01:49:42] <PeGaSuS> honestly, no. but it's nice to see all those "yes" there :D
[01:50:35] <DarthGandalf> perhaps I need to add "at least one of features is disabled: yes/no" there :P
[01:51:11] <PeGaSuS> hahaha
[01:52:20] <PeGaSuS> who knows if some time in the future I'll use i18n or other software that requires boost? so, it's installed already and it doesn't hurt. also, with 1Tb of space to spare...

[07:09:02] <luiserebii> For those of you that use buffer replay, do you find it difficult to read? On my client, what I see is `<time> <username> <timestamp> <msg>`, and i have to dart my eyes behind the timestamp to see who sent the message
[07:11:28] <luiserebii> Example of what I mean: https://i.imgur.com/ZpxXmNj.png
[07:12:08] <krytarik> No, because I usually start with reading at the sender nick.. >_>
[07:12:53] <Netboy3> luiserebii: znc adds the timestamp if it can't negotiate ircv3 "server-time" capability. make sure yout irc client has this enabled and you won't get the confusing "double time"
[07:13:46] <luiserebii> Netboy3: Thank you so much, I thought this might be an inevitability. I will read up on this
[07:14:30] <luiserebii> krytarik: well, i guess it's just me^^
[07:15:14] <krytarik> luiserebii: Nah, having looked at your screenshot now, I guess having the nicks colored helps with that.. :)
[07:15:46] <luiserebii> I fear that the lack of colors and styling is part of the problem also ;_;
[07:16:45] <luiserebii> I'm going to have to go on an adventure customizing and styling... I don't know if I'll play around with looking for themes. But, well, it's not so much a znc issue^^
[07:17:44] <krytarik> And while Irssi from Git supports server-time (along with many other IRCv3 caps), it breaks logging then in that it uses the current timestamps for that while displaying the one provided by server-time - so I'd hold off of that until they fixed this.

[07:20:33] <luiserebii> kryatarik: I see... by breaking logging, are you saying it breaks the znc logging or Irssi logging? I would imagine you would just need to use log from znc if you had it set up, no?

[07:24:00] <luiserebii> I'll imagine that my packaged release Irssi probably does not have server-time implemented, then... it seems like there's a server-time Perl script that supposedly implements it, did you try this and have thoughts by any chance? https://github.com/irssi/scripts.irssi.org/blob/master/scripts/server_time.pl
