[03:40:45] <luva> I will check that tomorrow if it detects it, but it should since it uses smartctl for detecting drives, but since it can only detect mounted ones, it has to be mounted cotrevtly

[03:57:35] <scruz> i'm trying to mount local folders (in WSL) to folders on the container.
[03:58:05] <scruz> here's what i ran: docker run -it -p 8000:8000 -e AWS_PROFILE=zappa -v "$(wslpath -w $(pwd)):/var/task" -v "$(wslpath -w ~/.aws/)":/root/.aws --rm zappa-docker-image
[03:58:53] <BtbN> Docker does not support WSL1
[03:59:25] <scruz> that's weird. i literally built the image i'm trying to run inside WSL1
[03:59:53] <tabakhase> scruz what do the wslpaths fgor pwd spit out? -- if i remember right, wsl1 docker is hyperv docker, so you need to be in a FS thats shared from the hot to wsl as well as the hyperV box and be there on the correct path
[04:00:14] <BtbN> Docker is very explicit about supporting WSL2 only
[04:00:37] <scruz> \\wsl$\Ubuntu-18.04\home\someuser...
[04:00:50] <scruz> but docker says it isn't a valid Windows path
[04:00:52] <tabakhase> BtbN carefull with such sentences ;-) docker-daemon != docker-cli != "can use docker" ;-)
[04:01:20] <BtbN> Well yes, you can run the docker cli in wsl1, but it's not overly useful. And a lot of stuff, like volumes, won't work
[04:01:33] <scruz> if i skip using wslpath (or i use wslpath -m), it mounts, but the folders are empty
[04:02:19] <scruz> if i use wslpath -w, i get the message: Error response from daemon: <path> (\\wsl$\Ubuntu...) is not a valid Windows path
[04:02:21] <tabakhase> if you align your paths to match on all ends, it will work - but you cant just share "any" folder out of wsl1, you need to start from the top  ((and by default i think it also slams an extra /mnt/ step in there or so...))
[04:02:45] <BtbN> You really will want to upgrade to WSL2 if you want to use Docker.
[04:04:32] <scruz> that's a bit of a catch-22. i stopped using wsl2 because performance was awful. kept hanging my system
[04:05:04] <scruz> thanks. i'll try to figure something out.
[04:05:24] <tabakhase> to run docker-deamon inside wsl you need wsl2 - but as said, there is rly no need todo that at all... - heck i run wsl1 with docker-toolbox - thats virtualbox, not even hyperV :D
[04:06:10] <BtbN> You need to treat wsl1 like a windows cmd terminal, it's just utterly painful and pointless. Can just fire up a Powershell and have a much smoother experience.
[04:07:37] <tabakhase> its rly just about lining up your paths - and the only ones "by default" are some remapped stuff on one end and specific folders on the other i think - pull this flat and things will work (((dont even attempt bash-wslpath-fixings, you will want to run stuff like docker-compose too and that cant do any of this)
[04:07:45] <scruz> i have the daemon running on Windows fine though. i only have the client running in WSL1 like tabakhase said.
[04:08:13] <tabakhase> and if you use wsl cause your files cant cope on a windows fielsystem, --- just threat em as two vms and setup filesharing on your own end - be it sshfs or whatever...
[04:08:30] <scruz> i followed this guide and haven't had issues until today: https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly
[04:08:37] <scruz> been over two years now
[04:08:46] <tabakhase> scruz there is no "docker-deamon" for windows, only linux. its always a VM
[04:09:17] <scruz> i guess it's because i'm trying bind mounts
[04:09:21] <tabakhase> (((unless were talking windows-containers, but even thats hyperV again running a full NTkernel, so basically a vm :P)
[04:09:51] <BtbN> windows containers are not hyperv, are they?
[04:10:04] <tabakhase> scruz step1 of this howto i already massive nogo lol :D
[04:10:07] <BtbN> They work very similar to how containers work on Linux, just that everything is Windows
[04:11:04] <scruz> tabakhase you mean the exposure without TLS?
[04:12:11] <scruz> i'll see if i can run things from the windows side of things
[04:12:52] <tabakhase> BtbN dont quote me on that i guess - but to my understanding it is - with that whole story beeing a "m$ must tick the container checkbox!!" so they somewhow hacked something together that can look like docker --- actual use of that in the wild seeems suuuper rare tho, like maybe once a month in here if even :P

[05:10:36] <ash_worksi> zamba: my philosophy is 1 repo per project. The proxy directory is intended for your production nginx container
[05:12:10] <ash_worksi> zamba: you might have numerous virtual hosts, perhaps you have SSL certs in secrets or whatever; that directory is for you to iron out exactly how you want that deployed.

[05:17:15] <ash_worksi> zamba: the "dummy" proxy directory in zamba_app/ is just for you to debug frontend stuff if that's what you want to do. It would just have maybe 1 location block like `location ^~/app { proxy_pass zamba_app:5000; }` or something

[15:11:08] <IceMichael> hi
[15:11:25] <IceMichael> what are the system-restrictions of using a docker container on some system?
[15:11:32] <IceMichael> sure, CPU and RAM should be sufficient
[15:12:11] <IceMichael> but now I learnt that an M1 container does not necessarily run on x86_64. Also, if I have Ubuntu 18 on it, a Ubuntu 22 container does not seem to run there reliably
[15:12:19] <IceMichael> are there other constraints that I might be missing on top?
[15:12:33] <IceMichael> and there is probably not a way to find out beforehand?
[15:12:55] <ikke> Why does the ubuntu22 image not run on ubuntu 18?
[15:13:35] <IceMichael> it *could* if the kernel was late enough
[15:13:35] *** Quits: mohabaks (~mohabaks@gateway/tor-sasl/mohabaks) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[15:14:02] <IceMichael> so sure. ubuntu18 with latest kernel (if that is supported) would probably also work
[15:14:34] <ikke> What in the ubuntu22 image requires a newer kernel?
[15:15:43] <IceMichael> I tried it out and it failed but I forgot what the problem was
[15:15:50] <ikke> recent alpine linux images require an up-to-date runc / containerd 
[15:16:17] <ikke> due to bad seccomp filtering on older versions
[15:16:26] <IceMichael> but there is no way to check an image against the up-to-date-ness, right?
[15:16:33] <ikke> No
[15:16:41] <IceMichael> because I wanted to build my Dockerfile and it failed after hours... jay
[15:16:42] <ikke> not in a general way
[15:16:51] <IceMichael> ok, too bad
[15:18:17] <IceMichael> but if the latest runc/containerd is not supported by some distro version, then I also need to upgrade the OS?
[15:18:33] <IceMichael> well, I guess it makes sense
[15:18:44] <ikke> You _could_ compile it yourself :)
[15:19:37] <IceMichael> I don't care so much about time invested once but more about stability/robustness of the image running everywhere :/
[15:19:53] <IceMichael> because if it's just running somewhere by chance, it does not really scale

[15:27:45] <ikke> Most interactions with the kernel should go through libc
[15:28:32] <IceMichael> so, the first error I get is: debconf: delaying package configuration, since apt-utils is not installed
[15:28:51] <IceMichael> within the step: RUN apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends apt-utils
[15:29:03] <IceMichael> so apt-utils cannot be installed because apt-utils is not installed apparently
[15:29:08] <IceMichael> without the line, the error comes later
[15:29:56] <ikke> but that should have nothing to do with the host os
[15:30:19] <ikke> or the kernel

[20:26:20] <hosk> i feel like it goes CMD -> volume mount, right?

[20:37:07] <BtbN> Volumes are mounted before the entrypoint is invoked. Everything else would be insanely broken.
[20:39:46] <hosk> i'm trying to get a retroarch-web docker image to index a samba share before kicking off--it currently does not see it and i suspect it's because the indexing is happening in the build of the image rather than the CMD entrypoint

[20:59:10] <ikke> the CMD statement in the Dockerfile just sets some metadata in the image. You can even run other statements after
[20:59:44] <ikke> when you run a container based on the image, docker will execute the entrypoint, and passes the CMD if no other command has been specfiied
