[01:32:07] <gilberth> pjb: I tried the latest CCL (v1.12.1-3-g2ae800e1) and it behaves as it should. Yet you mention version v1.12.1-7-g4912320e, which is different. And frankly I have no clue getting at that latter version being a complete git noob.
[01:33:53] <pjb> git@github.com:informatimago/ccl.git  commit 4912320edae5c2f02ef429c2a552ea495845ec03 (github/344--build-application-generates-a-kernel-without-a-saved-image) Merge remote-tracking branch 'github/364--simple-file-error-is-not-given-a-format-control' into 344--build-application-generates-a-kernel-without-a-saved-image
[01:34:09] <pjb> gilberth: it's a merge request I did to correct a few bugs.
[01:34:29] <pjb> gilberth: but really, nothing so high level as compiler macros, this shouldn't have impacted them.
[01:36:35] <gilberth> Yes, and this is what puzzles me. In particular I can't see any option in the compiler to stop it from expanding compiler macros. It expands compiler macros in the same function that expands macros. Strange.
[01:37:26] <hayley> Good morning everyone!
[01:38:04] <pjb> gilberth: well, in any case, I have something strange, since I can't save images.

[03:12:11] <hayley> I'm starting to think this second maths class is the same as the first, and you just show up for one.
[03:12:47] <gilberth> Ok. Dammit, is there some book I could read? About compilers that is.
[03:12:50] *** Quits: ec_ (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec) (Quit: ec_)
[03:13:02] <hayley> The Dragon book?
[03:13:17] <gilberth> Already read it. Thanks.
[03:13:38] <hayley> Craig Chambers's PhD thesis?
[03:14:56] <gilberth> It's more about: How to decide what to inline or unroll (which are more or less the same). Like my example <http://clim.rocks/nocturnal/opt-notes.html> GCC can almost do this kind of reasoning.
[03:16:11] <hayley> Not sure. IIRC Cliff Click mentioned it once but admitted his JIT liked to over-inline.
[03:17:48] <gilberth> Yes, milady. This would need some trial and error and heuristic, I guess. Attempt to inline sth and then judge if it is worth the effort, that is: The inlining could really reduce the computation needed.
[03:18:45] * hayley is stumped wondering how to decide when to auto-vectorize.
[03:19:15] <gilberth> Also IMHO GCC at times is for my taste too agressive with inlining. I generally don't believe in inlining per se. Function calls ought to be cheap. Inlining makes sense for me, when you drop in some constants or types to eliminate code.
[03:19:34] <hayley> Harder when you consider that good compilers generate an unrolled SIMD loop, then more SIMD tail processing, then scalar tail processing. But I guess we can live off unrolled SIMD + scalar tail.
[03:21:34] <moon-child> gilberth: I think gcc's inline heuristic is not much more sophisticated than an estimate of the instruction count of the function to be inlined.  Trying to inline and then backing out if the results are not satisfactory has been done, but it leads to incredibly bad compile times
[03:22:41] <gilberth> Well, this vectorizing is another animal. It basically is loop unrolling. What I want involves a bit more code transformations, like having "consing" a cons cell in lexicals, and thus no cons cell for real, but a car and cdr lexical, which would prompt further optimizations.
[03:23:04] <moon-child> hayley: I watched a talk at pldi a year or two ago about autovectorization.  Given a piece of scalar code, there are many valid vectorizations, and hard to choose the optimal one.  They applied a neural net !
[03:23:46] <hayley> moon-child: I'd take arbitrary vector instructions over none.
[03:26:23] <gilberth> moon-child: Compile time does not concern me here. I won't mind that. What I dream of is a whole program analysis for a whole system like CL + CLIM + your favorite libs, say, when you dump an image. As much as I like CCL because its compiler is dumb and thus fast, I won't mind having a slow, aggressive compiler, for compiling a whole image^Wcore once it's set. The latter could be optional.
[03:26:44] <hayley> "I’m currently deepening my understanding of C so I can read a book that makes a Lisp like language" should I be worried
[03:27:35] <gilberth> moon-child: And yes, backtracking sure is involved. And this is where the Dragon book stops IIRC.
[03:28:26] <pjb> there's a new edition of the Dragon Book. CPTP = Compiler Principles Techniques and Tools, Aho et al. http://dragonbook.stanford.edu/
[03:28:38] <moon-child> gilberth: so you want to give up the _possibility_ of opening up and debugging if something goes wrong, or changing behaviour later on?
[03:28:40] <gilberth> BTW that book is one of the few I had my wife bring along from my small yet fine private library.

[03:31:59] <gilberth> moon-child: For changing behaviour, my idea is, that I keep some IR and recompile callers, if needed. And frankly, I don't care so much about debugging, as long as I get a spot where mishap happened. I won't use the debugger for more and generally debug with PRINT.
[03:32:41] <moon-child> ah--so you want JIT !
[03:32:47] <gilberth> pjb: Thanks! I wasn't aware.
[03:33:20] <gilberth> moon-child: When you want to call it that way, yes. I rather would call it dynamic recompilation.
[03:33:54] <lotuseater> hayley: maybe this "Build your own lisp" book is meant which shows howto in C
[03:34:16] <hayley> lotuseater: Yes, that is what I hope isn't the case.
[03:34:58] <gilberth> This "build your own lisp" book is satire. It's so incredible bad, that it just couldn't be serious.
[03:35:18] <lotuseater> :D
[03:35:30] <gilberth> It's essentially a HOW-TO-NOT-DO-IT.
[03:35:53] <lotuseater> could you explain more why?
[03:36:05] <hayley> lotuseater: https://gist.github.com/no-defun-allowed/7e3e238c959e27d4919bb4272487d7ad

[03:36:21] <lotuseater> hehe
[03:36:42] <gilberth> lotuseater: For starters, you compare symbols for EQ by strcmp(3) on its name? Great!
[03:37:11] <hayley> TL/DR: dynamic scope in 2021, puts too much faith in C catching errors, not-macro system makes no sense, dubious use of things that aren't enums, author can't write benchmarks.
[03:38:44] <gilberth> Wasn't there also O(n^2) scanning input? Doesn't matter, that book is a show case of "I have no clue at all."
[03:38:52] <hayley> Yes.
[03:38:54] <moon-child> the macro system is the worst part.  It wouldn't be _so_ bad if it were just eval, but the quoting mechanism is just utterly bizarre
[03:39:25] <gilberth> And as hayley figured out the language implemented also is just a mess with no sensible semantics.
[03:39:37] <lotuseater> hui
[03:40:37] <gilberth> This book is dangerous.
[03:41:07] <gilberth> In so far I am grateful that hayley wrote about it.
[03:42:21] <gilberth> Anyhow, I dream on of my hypothetical dynamic compiling system I wanted for aged.
[03:44:03] <lotuseater> volume 7 of The Art of Computer Programming will be about compilers ...
[03:44:43] <hayley> Did you know 1 in 3 #lispcafe participants haven't read Craig Chambers's PhD thesis?
[03:44:44] <hayley> I have. Gnuxie has.
[03:44:48] * hayley looks at gilberth
[03:45:34] <lotuseater> aha
[03:46:52] * gilberth tries to look innocent.
[03:47:49] <gilberth> My favorite quote "C programs crashing is a fact of life." That's a fine attitude towards hacking.
[03:48:24] <hayley> So, for our assignment to write a program which generates random villages, we are already somewhere on day 2 (of about 21). I can generate okay-ish paths and someone wrote a house generator on the weekend (which more or less generates skyscrapers, but the general idea is good).
[03:48:30] <hayley> gilberth: The problem is that they don't crash.
[03:48:50] <gilberth> So if you're don't have the discipline to write in C^Wportable PDP-11 assembler, don't.

[03:56:46] <hayley> Still, the house^Wskyscraper generator gives me some idea of how to approach a less regular-shaped house. It works based on building a BSP of sorts. An irregular shape could be made by joining two rectangles together, and the BSP is not too hard.
[03:57:52] <gilberth> You discovered CSG?
[03:58:33] <hayley> CSG?
[03:59:27] <gilberth> Constructive solid geometry. Boolean set operations on polyhedrons, basically.
[03:59:54] <hayley> I don't think so.
[04:00:04] <hayley> We do the reverse: start with some shape, and pick appropriate places to put walls.
[04:01:25] <gilberth> Ah, ok. Do you render your 3d models?
[04:01:36] <hayley> In Minecraft.
[04:02:34] <hayley> And we can generate some BSP which contains a staircase room, would we need to make multiple floors.
[04:03:05] <gilberth> Have we proven yet, that Minecraft is flat? Didn't White_Flame question that?
[04:04:29] <hayley> Tricky question. One theory is that, as travelling through the Nether (underworld) and portalling back multiplies your displacement by 8, the world must be a sphere and the Nether is deeper down.
[04:05:13] <hayley> And the curvature would be smaller than on Earth, as the world is larger, and people usually don't use high render distances. So you'd be hard pressed to observe it.
[04:05:47] <gilberth> Heh, so that really is a question?
[04:06:03] <hayley> Sadly I can't seem to get an acceptable draw distance with nice shaders and frame rate on this machine ):
[04:06:29] <gilberth> Perhaps it's cylindrical?
[04:06:45] <hayley> That's weirder.
[04:07:03] * gilberth knows next to nothing about Minecraft.
[04:07:17] <gilberth> hayley: Or a teapot? Who knows.
[04:08:26] <hayley> The playable world is about 60Mm by 60Mm.
[04:10:04] <White_Flame> flat minecraft planet is a conspiracy by microsoft and notch to keep the truth away from players 
[04:11:48] <moon-child> toroid minecraft
[04:11:48] * hayley stands still and Minecraft still conses at 85MB/s
[04:11:48] <lotuseater> haha read a funny comment in an SBCL source file "This seems silly. Is there something better?"
[04:18:58] * hayley runs a mod for 1.16.5 Minecraft on 1.16.3
[04:20:19] <hayley> Okay, looks faster I guess? Problem is that it creates a new "installation" profile and thus forgets the ZGC flag.
[04:20:48] <White_Flame> moon-child: it's not even toroidal; the map doesn't wrap
[04:21:11] <moon-child> klein minecraft
[04:21:24] <hayley> So they decided to use internal flags to change the G1 region size to 32MB? Why?
[04:24:41] <White_Flame> probably because some page bitwidth packs nicely into some of their data
[04:31:28] <gilberth> moon-child: CL has this idea of compilation units and the compiler has the license to do all sorts of optimizations withing that compilation unit. CMUCL^WSBCL uses that license, and redefining a single function loaded from a compiled file is not guaranteed to work. With SBCL you can't just c-c c-c, but rather would need to recompile the whole file. I always hated that behaviour.
[04:34:01] <gilberth> moon-child: One of the reasons I prefer CCL for development. Its compiler is just too straight-forward. But I believe we could have both.
[04:36:27] <gilberth> In early 90s I implemented a byte code for XLISP and argument list parsing was on the caller side. Would a signature change, callers would be updated by patching the BC. Thus: Little overhead for keyword parameters.
[04:43:42] * hayley uploaded an image: (357KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/NnpLRxHIbgVQMOIVdHTiaDRa/2021-09-08_10.19.13.jpeg >
[04:43:45] <hayley> So you see this far. How would I test curvature?
[04:44:30] <moon-child> measure the interior angles of a large triangle
[04:44:38] <moon-child> hm, perspective transform may make that difficult
[04:45:27] <gilberth> It might also locally be rendered pretending a flat Minecraft. I won't trust that.
[04:45:31] <hayley> What I mean is that, with a mere 100m or so before render distance^W^Wfog kicks in, it is a bit tricky.
[04:49:30] <gilberth> minecraft.net does not talk to me: "You don't have permission to access "http://www.minecraft.net/" on this server." So much for that.
[04:51:52] <gilberth> Perhaps hayley build a building like this <https://www.fotos-reiseberichte.de/kalifornien/sandiego/hakenkreuz.jpg> and it's now illegal here.

[12:04:42] <kakuhen> as much as people hate cmake, at least it's not as braindead as autoconf or whatever people use to make configure scripts that can't even configure properly
[12:05:26] <kakuhen> somehow i have to hold the linker's hand and tell it the exact library under ${prefix}/lib since it somehow can't find it on its own
[12:05:52] <kakuhen> and i have to do this in two separate ways so that (1) the configure script doesnt think SDL is missing from my system, and (2) the linker can find libintl.dylib at the end of compilation
[12:07:12] <dave0> .dylib is macos?
[12:07:21] <kakuhen> yeah -- just think of it as "shared object"
[12:07:41] <kakuhen> I know the libraries are properly installed on my system because "pkg-config --libs sdl2" gives me "-L/opt/local/lib -lSDL"
[12:07:56] <kakuhen> meanwhile the configure script, unless I override LDFLAGS, will fail to find SDL libraries
[12:08:48] <kakuhen> and despite -L/opt/local/lib appearing multiple times in compiler flags... then a linker error occurs at the very end of compiling the game since g++ apparently can't find /opt/local/lib/libintl.dylib
[12:08:58] <kakuhen> granted, libintl.dylib is a symlink to libintl.8.dylib, so that may be it? idk
[12:09:00] <dave0> i don't know how configure works, i just know that sometimes it takes longer to configure the program that it does to compile it
[12:09:08] <kakuhen> LBreakoutHD is one such program w
[12:09:17] <kakuhen> takes like 20 seconds to configure and compiles in under 5 seconds
[12:09:24] <dave0> yeah that's bollocks
[12:10:03] <kakuhen> anyway, compiling the game from source more or less "just works" on FreeBSD and Linux, but OS X is being dumb as usual.
[12:10:38] <dave0> i read somewhere that linux finally put solaris out of business... is that true?
[12:10:40] <kakuhen> though I'm still willing to blame the configure script because SDL2 and gettext *are* installed properly. pkg-config gives me the right flags and I've compiled tons of software that have depended on either of the two.
[12:10:59] <kakuhen> and it's just this one software that somehow fails to find the libraries 
[12:11:10] <kakuhen> dave0: linux put most commercial unices out of business it seems ;)
[12:11:55] <kakuhen> I expect the only AIX users in 2021 are banks running some ancient boxes with some COBOL implementation for their financial software.
[12:12:15] <kakuhen> as for HP-UX, who knows? Itanium is dead by 2025 and HPE hasn't mentioned any plans of maintaining HP-UX after Itanium is gone
[12:12:36] <kakuhen> something like 60% of Solaris team at Oracle got laid off back in 2017, and Oracle offers their own Linux distro now.
[12:12:39] <kakuhen> the list goes on.

[15:43:28] <gilberth> Heh, made to last.
[15:43:54] <pl> gilberth: effectively, military grade components were easier to source than civilian
[15:44:14] <pl> due to a whole clusterfuck of effects that lead to cold war, in a way
[15:45:11] <gilberth> But, actually in the east you found no planed obsolesce. (sp?)
[15:45:50] <pl> gilberth: there wasn't planned obsolescence most of the time, but for many things you can't escape that
[15:46:02] <pl> (essentially all flying hw, for example)
[15:47:14] <gilberth> I remember a documentary about the light bulb cartel. Once some east german manufacturer wanted to sell light bulbs (lasting way longer) to the west and was laughed at.
[15:47:15] <pl> quality of manufactured devices tended to depend on factory and when in the plan it was made
[15:47:42] <pl> gilberth: sometimes the cost of making the longer-lasting devices is higher than people think, too
[15:47:55] <pl> raw resource market in the east was heavily distorted, for example
[15:48:39] <pl> so where a western manufacturer might be looking to switch to different materials, eastern one might have gone with heavy steel etc.
[15:49:29] <gilberth> Also: Nylon stockings would last for ever, and the early on the market did, wouldn't it be for an additive to make them age by UV light.
[15:51:19] <gilberth> pl: Sure, sure. But I believe the west in general went too far with depending on selling new products all the time. OTOH it also is the customers, I am too cheap to buy cheap.
[15:52:11] <gilberth> As for the customer it is more expensive to buy cheap products which fail early.
[15:59:08] <pl> OTOH without that you can't get upgrades out too much
[16:01:40] <gilberth> Well, there are a lot of things where there is no progress anymore. Why would I want to upgrade my shoes? Or my cooking gear? Is a '21 frying pan any better than one from '11?
[16:02:02] <gilberth> I don't even need a new phone each year.
[16:02:57] <gilberth> I have the feeling that many people value things just because they are new. And new must be better.

[16:32:21] <pl> I think the one company still making hal effect keyboards in Europe also had DDR roots 
[16:32:26] <shka> which is, mind you, hall effect
[16:32:32] <shka> so no even contacts
[16:32:43] <pl> shka: reliable connectivity elsewhere 
[16:33:08] <shka> pl: i mean, no contacts
[16:33:13] <pl> Frankly speaking, gold in keyboard makes more sense than where majority of the gold in use goes 
[16:33:50] <pl> shka: contacts between switch housing and the rest, contacts to on controller, contacts to computer 
[16:33:57] <shka> digital output and gold feels wrong
[16:34:19] <pl> Well, Hall effect switches are analog... 
[16:34:29] <shka> but output is digital
[16:34:34] <shka> from the keyboard
[16:34:39] <shka> well, maybe not from this one
[16:34:39] <pl> From the controller, yes 
[16:34:51] <pl> Which takes in analog signals from the switches 
[16:34:56] <shka> pl: i mean, it can have controller in the main unit even
[16:35:01] <pl> Also, non-corroding 
[16:35:13] <pl> shka: it pretty much has to have controller in the main unit 
[16:35:34] <shka> not sure about that one
[16:36:46] <shka> but it certainly can
[16:37:16] <shka> hall effect keyboards needs to calibrate itself anyway
[16:37:33] <shka> so maybe uneven output is not a big deal
[16:38:00] <shka> anyway, strong soviet input deviec
[16:38:51] <ck_> they were working on a lisp machine in east germany, but the country didn't last long enough
[16:38:54] <pl> The big black chip at the top of the pcb is the MCU 
[16:39:51] <shka> pl: ok
[16:40:07] <pl> I might have mentioned it too many times, but the oldest pocket computer I ever touched was a Soviet pocket pdp-11 running BASIC 
[16:40:22] <ck_> neat
[16:45:50] <pl> It was a "clone" of a casio pocket computer, except done black box RE
[16:46:24] <pl> So all hw and code was Soviet made, but the external design and general BASIC functionality was based on casio manual, afaik 
[16:47:23] <pl> So instead of whatever low power circuitry casio used, the early models had Unix-capable PDP-11 cpu with LCD controller on Qbus 
[16:47:43] <pl> Later ones used mcu-ified version of the same cpu

[16:55:18] <ck_> that span of time going from room-filling to pocket-size computing always amazes
[16:57:24] <ck_> what kind of cray were they sitting on again in the movie Sneakers
[16:57:28] <gilberth> What me amazes is that when you look at pictures of early computer modules, they didn't really tried to make it small. I wonder why.
[16:57:54] <pl> Some of it is due to manufacturing constraints 
[16:58:30] <gilberth> Radios of the same time were way denser in packing.
[16:58:58] <pl> For example, IBM SMS brought more benefit from standard size an connector than making the models smaller 
[16:59:19] <pl> gilberth: radios were simpler and had higher production numbers 
[17:00:09] <shka> and they were only analog
[17:00:21] <pl> A lot of very early computers were made from boards like IBM SMS, where you had essentially equivalent of small 74xx chip... The size of postcard 
[17:00:32] <pl> AM radios are also conceptually very, very simple 
[17:01:39] <gilberth> I mean sth like this <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Dec_SYSTEM_BUILDING_BLOCKS_1103.jpg/1280px-Dec_SYSTEM_BUILDING_BLOCKS_1103.jpg>
[17:01:54] <gilberth> What an awful long URL.
[17:03:57] <pl> gilberth: DEC started out making those blocks as standard modules to use in building other electronics 
[17:06:38] <pl> Anyway, radios needed comparatively little in circuits, and didn't require constantly changing functions or using replaceable modules to build a series of related but different devices

[17:10:40] <gilberth> Why not like this: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board#/media/File:Cordwoodcircuit.agr.jpg> I needed a while to find a picture. Because I didn't know the term. Also: https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tink.png?w=800
[17:12:31] <gilberth> pl: A radio circuit is less standardized than a few transistors actually. And I don't question the method of using modules of 74xx-like functions. And being modules I would expect you don't really need service them but just replace the whole module.
[17:15:03] <pl> gilberth: it might be less standardised, but it's comparatively simple and needs to be done as
[17:15:03] <pl> a whole 
[17:15:29] <pl> But in terms of complexity of circuitry they were simpler

[17:16:33] * pl used to read instructions on building cheap radios at home 
[17:16:47] <gilberth> Yes, I didn't say a radio was more complex than a CPU. It's more complex and less regular than a board with all the same  NAND gates, say.
[17:17:48] * gilberth build valve radios as a child.
[17:19:47] <gilberth> But then I also believe that SMD could haven earlier.
[17:20:24] * hayley remembers a guide to building a simple AM radio in primary school.
[17:20:50] <hayley> You get some coil, some other crap and a lot of wire around your room.
[17:22:07] <hayley> A diode^Wcrystal radio iirc.

[17:23:18] <gilberth> A coil, a wire, a diode, a capacitor, and a head phone. And a radio station. The latter no longer operational here.
[17:24:28] <gilberth> Germanium diodes work for that.
[17:24:37] <hayley> Days since Gil Tene followed me on social media for some reason: 2
[17:25:04] <hayley> Now, surely his bar isn't as low as "Hayley asked about how the read barrier works, thus she must be interesting."
[17:28:38] <gilberth> And btw when you think about it the complexity of a CPU is not in its building blocks, but in the wires.
[17:29:16] <hayley> Must be time to dream of wires now.
[17:32:17] <gilberth> Speaking of dreams, the brain is the same. It's the wires and not the neurons.
