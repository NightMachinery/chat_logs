[00:52:01] <theholyduck> i was just thinking about things.. 
[00:52:09] <theholyduck> but apparently Moyst made the transition here
[00:52:10] <theholyduck> >D
[00:52:54] <Bco1981> but is seilent
[00:52:59] <theholyduck> emmeka: man she klooks to be so much younger to you
[00:53:03] <theholyduck> er
[00:53:04] <theholyduck> ...
[00:53:09] <theholyduck> she looks so much younger than him
[00:53:12] <theholyduck> in the images on that show
[00:53:22] <theholyduck> but shes supposed to marry him?
[00:54:29] <theholyduck> Tamahiko's 14-year-old bride. She was purchased for ¬•200,000 (¬•10,000 in the one-shot) by Tamahiko's father." yeah. thats not.. great
[00:54:57] <theholyduck> then i was like.. i hope this show was set a long time ago..
[00:55:35] <theholyduck> and its apparently 1905. which i GUESS is marrying 14 year olds old. 
[00:56:10] <theholyduck> im not entirely sure when/if japan did anything about marrying children
[01:04:41] <emmeka> theholyduck he's also a teenager, though, and it's surprisingly wholesome
[01:04:57] <emmeka> he's like 16 or something
[01:05:16] <theholyduck>  its also apparently written by a woman
[01:05:25] <theholyduck> which USUALLY aliviates some of my this could be so creepy concerns
[01:05:34] <theholyduck> then again that didnt really solve the usagi drop situation
[01:05:51] <emmeka> theholyduck the title is Taisho Woman's Fairytale, it's Taisho era around the time of the great kanto earthquake
[01:06:04] <emmeka> which is 1923
[01:07:29] <emmeka> theholyduck it's very much not creepy, anyway. the ultimate ending isn't "we just went through with the arranged marriage with this girl my dad bought for me"
[01:07:42] <emmeka> some plot happens and things are wholesome
[01:08:57] <emmeka> I'd explain why, but it'd be a spoiler, so I'll just let people watch it and make up their own minds
[01:09:29] <theholyduck> i mostly just objected cause he looks like a man in the promotional image and she looks like a literal child half his height
[01:09:48] <emmeka> apparently he is 17
[01:10:40] <emmeka> and anyway, he objects to the whole notion of some girl having been bought for him and just forced to stay with him, he's hostile to the whole arrangement in the beginning
[01:11:10] <Bco1981> wait wut ?
[01:12:06] <theholyduck> emmeka: so basicly the dad is the creep
[01:12:10] <emmeka> yes
[01:12:20] <emmeka> he's more or less the antagonist
[01:17:45] <emmeka> theholyduck basically MC is the firstborn son but then he gets in an accident and becomes disabled, and his dad basically decides that he's now useless and exiles him to a country manor and says "here's some random chick I bought, now don't come back"
[01:18:22] <theholyduck> thats some quality bad dad energy
[01:21:48] <Bco1981> if the guy don't like the arrangement, is there anything keeping her from just leavinhg?

[01:22:51] <emmeka> Bco1981 yeah she was literally bought as property by his father. this whole problem is basically the entire plot of it.
[01:23:35] <emmeka> it's a good manga, anyway. Very fluffy and wholesome for something that starts off with the plot device of uh, slavery. I hope the anime does it some justice.
[01:23:37] <Bco1981> sure bought as property... but it's not like she is in chains or locked in the place ?
[01:24:08] <emmeka> she was bought from her own family to settle a debt, and has basically nowhere else to go even if she did run.

[05:05:12] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Kamen no Ninja Akakage | Episode: 2
[05:06:06] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: HEY
[05:06:18] <MootPoot> listen, it comes in handy ok
[05:06:34] <MootPoot> But anyway ButterNoodle I had to upgrade my PC BT dongle to a 5.0 one 
[05:06:41] <ButterNoodle> yea when I need to take a shit while I'm on a conference call
[05:06:47] <ButterNoodle> and hope the mute works
[05:06:49] <MootPoot> Was getting audio lag and cutouts in VR 
[05:06:55] <ButterNoodle> oh
[05:07:13] <ButterNoodle> so it pairs w bruetoof?
[05:07:21] <ButterNoodle> I thought u needed a cable
[05:07:25] <MootPoot> Turns out a 4.0 dongle that I had can't really handle a Xbox controller and a bt headset at the same time 
[05:07:38] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: well I use a cable for video and tracking 
[05:07:46] <MootPoot> But audio I just use BT 
[05:07:54] <ButterNoodle> ic
[05:08:20] <MootPoot> I can plug it into my headset , it has a 3.5 jack but to get it to work I have to keep the stock oculus install drivers 
[05:08:26] <MootPoot> With all their telemetry
[05:09:09] <MootPoot> I could also use the headset without a cable to my PC, but I'll take the better visuals over dealing with one cable

[08:48:44] <amigojapan> Sadale: it has a Mac OS like GUI
[08:48:45] <MootPoot> Wannacry was already patched but people who "wanted control of their updates" didn't update and let their systems be taken over by a already known exploit
[08:49:15] <ButterNoodle> if ur not smart enough to keep viruses and malware off ur network then u should take the update pill
[08:49:16] <Sadale> amigojapan, aww I'd like to have Windows XP GUI more
[08:49:40] <DunceCotus> If you're not smart enough to be dumb, there's no helping ya
[08:50:00] <ButterNoodle> I am, so I dont
[08:50:22] <Sadale> I seriously don't get why there'd be a TPM 2.0 requirement for Windows 11.
[08:50:25] <Sadale> Honestly, that's dumb
[08:50:49] <DunceCotus> Sadale: hardware sales $$$$$
[08:50:57] <Sadale> I'm thinking if I could make a dummy TPM.
[08:50:57] <ButterNoodle> so when I ask about disabling automatic reboots on windows, and some idiot ms "user" tells me to deal with it.. there's the problem
[08:51:05] <MootPoot> DunceCotus: can you stop with that crap lol
[08:51:08] <ButterNoodle> in the #windows channel
[08:51:11] <amigojapan> Sadale: they want to force people to pay for a new lisenese
[08:51:14] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: what crap
[08:51:15] <Sadale> So it'd appears that it'd do the crypto shit, while in fact, it actually do nothing.
[08:51:19] <Sadale> amigojapan, probably. capitalism
[08:51:20] <MootPoot> Nobody is buying a new computer just for win11
[08:51:23] <MootPoot> Lmao
[08:51:27] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: actually..
[08:51:29] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: who cares about the license.. I get coa for $3
[08:52:03] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: the TPM 2.0 requirement means some people will have to if they want Win 11
[08:52:09] <MootPoot> Brb
[08:52:10] <ButterNoodle> I just dont want a bunch of bloated shit that 1/2 ass works, to now force reboot me when I am.. ahem... in the middle of something
[08:52:11] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: well they want to do it by forcing people to buy new PCs

[08:52:45] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: have to for VR and games
[08:52:50] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, fuck
[08:52:53] <Sadale> xD
[08:53:00] <ButterNoodle> yea ik
[08:53:01] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, win10 then :P
[08:53:09] <ButterNoodle> I'll run 10 forever
[08:53:09] <DunceCotus> use windows but don't enjoy it
[08:53:33] <ButterNoodle> yea windows is the bootloader for my linux VM anyway
[08:53:46] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: when people buy a new PC they are also paying Microsoft money
[08:53:46] <Sadale> Sometimes I have to use windows for games as well, including osu, factorio and various eroge.
[08:54:02] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: you mean a pre-built
[08:54:12] <ButterNoodle> I dont pay shit to ms when I build one
[08:54:21] <amigojapan> Yup which is most people ButterNoodle 
[08:54:47] <ButterNoodle> and since pc comes prepackaged.. why does it matter what win11 hw requirements are
[08:54:53] <ButterNoodle> since they are for older pc's
[08:55:11] <ButterNoodle> those requirements are only for people that want to upgrade to 11 and have an old shit box
[08:55:39] <ButterNoodle> since they are going to get in line win95 style for 11... seems counter productive
[08:55:54] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I want to upgrade to 11 on my old PC
[08:55:57] <ButterNoodle> when ms can make $150 off of a retail purchase
[08:56:18] <ButterNoodle> but makes $20 off of an oem copy they sell to dell
[08:56:19] <DunceCotus> Windows 11 is literally just a paint job on 10
[08:56:23] <DunceCotus> not much point upgrading
[08:56:46] <ButterNoodle> there isnt.. but the way ms does things.. they will phase out 10 and only patch 11
[08:56:47] <DunceCotus> probably more bloat
[08:56:52] <ButterNoodle> sure
[08:56:56] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: not for a few years
[08:57:02] <ButterNoodle> probably about 20% more
[08:57:03] <DunceCotus> and by that time we'll have 12
[08:57:06] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: eventually win 10 won't be supported anymore
[08:57:09] <ButterNoodle> ahh yes
[08:57:17] <ButterNoodle> but if we get 13.. thats too old for me
[08:57:44] <ButterNoodle> :3
[08:57:44] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: 12.5?
[08:57:50] <ButterNoodle> good enough
[08:58:35] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: watch Sonny Boy

[09:15:04] <ButterNoodle> some not really with us anymore
[09:15:30] <ButterNoodle> :) but I did have a funny moment  on that one
[09:18:01] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it's ok. I was not paying attention
[09:21:32] <amigojapan> What do the trash taste people mean by "best drip"?
[09:21:46] <theholyduck> i thought they were doing free upgrades from 10 to 11
[09:21:51] <Sadale> alright. Time to get lunch :3
[09:22:02] <theholyduck> asuming you meet the hardware specs anywa
[09:22:20] <amigojapan> theholyduck: it's free but you need tpm 2.0
[09:23:04] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  sure. but the TPM stuff is going to be good protection against a bunch of different types  of attacks
[09:23:32] <amigojapan> theholyduck: and it makes not so old machines obsolete
[09:23:35] <Sadale> I wonder how TPM works and if I could access it specs.
[09:23:41] <Sadale> If so I'm thinking if I could make a dummy TPM
[09:23:52] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  why does it do that? windows 10 is going to be supported for a ton mroe years isnt it?
[09:24:01] <Sadale> like the one that can generate fake true random numbers that isn't truely random
[09:24:15] <Sadale> Maybe I could just report 4 for each random number request :P
[09:24:19] <amigojapan> theholyduck: only till 2025
[09:24:24] <theholyduck> amigojapan: "only" 
[09:24:37] <amigojapan> theholyduck: that is a short time
[09:24:53] <theholyduck> thats 4 more years. 
[09:25:01] <theholyduck> if you are running a computer that isnt 2.0 compatible
[09:25:03] <Sadale> oh the specs is available. https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-library-specification/
[09:25:03] <theholyduck> in 4 more years

[09:25:06] <amigojapan> As I said that is short
[09:25:08] <theholyduck> that computer is like 7 or 8 years old 
[09:25:09] <theholyduck> at that poitn
[09:25:13] <theholyduck> right?
[09:26:02] <theholyduck> amigojapan: i dont think ending support for computers 7 or 8 years old
[09:26:05] <theholyduck> is entirely unreasonable
[09:26:12] <amigojapan> They should not be declaring things obsolete. Tpm should be optional
[09:26:34] <amigojapan> Well I think it is unreasonable
[09:26:39] <theholyduck> why shouldnt they? one of the biggest problesm windows has is too much backwards compatibility
[09:26:54] <theholyduck> its its biggest strenght sure
[09:27:00] <theholyduck> but it makes doing security stuff real hard
[09:27:51] <amigojapan> I hope this makes many people finally install Linux
[09:28:16] <theholyduck> amigojapan: again if its happening its going to be in 4 years on computers thats like 7 or 8 years old at a time
[09:28:19] <Sadale> It seems that if I may have the required skill to develop a TPM module.
[09:28:31] <Sadale> I don't think I've got the time to do that tho :(
[09:28:39] <theholyduck> Sadale: i mean a big part of how the whole thing works is the special certificates and stuff
[09:28:57] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  i think most people are just going to buy a new computer at that point
[09:29:13] <theholyduck> ive been a computer owner and user since 1997.
[09:29:26] <amigojapan> Not me theholyduck 
[09:29:26] <theholyduck> and the longest i have ever owned and used a single computer was 5 years
[09:30:24] <amigojapan> theholyduck: lifetime of computers has increased a lot in recent years
[09:30:40] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  sure my most recent computer was the one i kept using for 5 almost 6 years
[09:30:45] <theholyduck> before i upgraded 
[09:30:48] <Sadale> damn I'm now kind of tempted to make a dummy TPM module xD
[09:31:04] <theholyduck> Sadale:  i mean i doubt windows will recognize and trust it :P
[09:31:06] <Sadale> A module that report incorrect dummy results xD
[09:31:08] <MootPoot> theholyduck: the average user replaces their computer after 4.75 years 
[09:31:17] <MootPoot> According to statistics 
[09:31:22] <MootPoot> Statistica*
[09:31:23] <Sadale> theholyduck, I mean how can you tell Windows wouldn't recognize that?
[09:31:35] <theholyduck> Sadale: because the whole point of the TPM/secure boot stuff
[09:31:39] <theholyduck> is signing binaries
[09:31:39] <Sadale> aw
[09:31:54] <theholyduck> your dummy module wouldnt work for that
[09:31:57] <Sadale> ok. I'll just do the minimal required to get the TPM to be recognized then :D
[09:32:15] <Sadale> Then the other less important commands would be implemented as dummy replies :D
[09:32:25] <theholyduck> MootPoot:  sure. soo. supporting computers up to like 8 years old. 
[09:32:32] <theholyduck> seems not that unreasonable to me
[09:32:56] <Sadale> And I'd sell them real cheap so that people'd buy them. Hopefulky this'd fuck microsoft up for forcefully requiring people to get TPM 2.0
[09:33:24] <theholyduck> Sadale: i mean. your idea absolutely wouldnt work. because if it could that would defeat the whole point of TPM
[09:33:30] <theholyduck> but you have fun with that
[09:34:04] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: what does "good drip"mean?
[09:34:15] <ButterNoodle> ?
[09:35:22] <MootPoot> theholyduck: yeah, I don't see what the big deal is with the windows TPM requirement
[09:35:32] <MootPoot> The average user would swap computers anyway 
[09:35:48] <MootPoot> And it's not like win11 allows you to do something 10 does not 
[09:35:49] <amigojapan> MootPoot: that is cause you don't care about using money
[09:35:53] <theholyduck> yeah the average user whos on a computer that doesnt support tpm can probably use it until its 7 or 8 years old. 
[09:36:01] <theholyduck> which is fine
[09:36:26] <theholyduck> as somebody who has tried to run windows 10 on a computer thats NOW 7 or 8 years old
[09:36:28] <theholyduck> its not pretty
[09:36:42] <theholyduck> if it wasnt a high end computer back then
[09:36:59] <theholyduck> we mostly have old computers at the makerspace and to get security updates and stuff on them we run windows 10
[09:37:06] <MootPoot> amigojapan: explain me this, if the entire point about windows 11 is that they want to make money by forcing people to get new computers , and getting the OEM licence money, why are they giving free upgrades to millions of computers that exist today instead of forcing them to pay too like they did in the past? 
[09:37:13] <theholyduck> it works. but i had to add extra ram to all of them
[09:37:13] <MootPoot> Your logic dosent follow 
[09:37:34] <theholyduck> MootPoot: i THINK hes saying that we dont care about spenidng money on a new computer 
[09:37:51] <theholyduck> amigojapan: anyways if you are budget concious the solution has always been get a anicent computer and run linux on it
[09:37:55] <theholyduck> that was true 10 years ago
[09:37:55] <MootPoot> Somehow they are money hungry enough to force people to buy new computers but not enough to make people buy new licences for their TPM 2.0 windows mach ii bed 
[09:37:57] <theholyduck> and its true today
[09:38:01] <MootPoot> ^
[09:38:08] <MootPoot> Machines*
[09:38:12] <theholyduck> and it will be true in 4 years when windows 10 support ends
[09:38:18] <theholyduck> most people are not THAT budget concious
[09:38:19] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yeah that is what I am going to do
[09:38:21] <theholyduck> when it comes to computers
[09:38:36] <theholyduck> buying a new one is not THAT expensive. and its usually a worthwhile upgrade if its more than 5 years old anyway
[09:38:46] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but I want to keep the option of paying vrchat
[09:39:18] <amigojapan> theholyduck: I am a cheapskate
[09:40:41] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  what are you going on about
[09:40:59] <MootPoot> windows 10 will keep being able to play vrchat whenever it wants
[09:41:05] <amigojapan> I am speaking English MootPoot 
[09:41:06] <MootPoot> be there windows 11 or not
[09:41:18] <MootPoot> I'm confused on what relation vrchat has to do with windows 11
[09:41:20] <theholyduck> anyways a TPM or something LIKE it has been a requirement on anything not directly PC related for a while now 
[09:41:29] <theholyduck> like my chromebook has a TPM chip for verifying the O
[09:41:32] <theholyduck> os
[09:41:38] <theholyduck> my phone only runs signed os's
[09:41:52] <amigojapan> MootPoot: eventually you won't be able to run vrchat with win 11
[09:42:00] <theholyduck> microsoft is just trying to catch up to everyone else in terms of security
[09:42:25] <theholyduck> amigojapan: why do you say that=
[09:42:34] <theholyduck> as far as i know you can still run vrchat in windows 7
[09:42:39] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  thats probably going to be because VR chat will stop supporting older .NET and windows verions, not the other way around
[09:42:42] <MootPoot> if that ever happens
[09:42:58] <theholyduck> nvm you need windows 8 for vrchat
[09:43:10] <amigojapan> theholyduck: planned obsolescence
[09:43:13] <theholyduck> still windows 8 is like 11 years old now
[09:43:23] <MootPoot> lol, I like the duality here
[09:43:24] <theholyduck> amigojapan:   er
[09:43:26] <theholyduck> 9
[09:43:28] <theholyduck> i meant to say
[09:43:43] <amigojapan> theholyduck: when your are 43 years old that is not a long time
[09:43:59] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  nobody is going to maintain perfect software support forever
[09:44:10] <MootPoot> windows is shit and bloated because it hangs onto old code and legacy support, but when its even maybe potentially cutting off that, windows is now terrible for cutting off old hardware

[09:45:34] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  ubuntu thats like "best" in class only do like 3 or 4 years support 
[09:45:37] <theholyduck> on the LTS releases
[09:45:50] <theholyduck> you need to do a full upgrade every 3 or 4 years which might break shit
[09:46:19] <amigojapan> theholyduck: that does not require you to buy new hardware
[09:46:41] <theholyduck> amigojapan: i mean. it does over time as it gets heavier to run. or you want to do more fancy stuff on it
[09:46:42] <amigojapan> Also Ubuntu is crap
[09:46:59] <theholyduck> amigojapan: sure but like any distro with BETTER long term support
[09:47:06] <theholyduck> is basicly unusable for a desktop
[09:47:12] <theholyduck> unless you dont mind sideloading every fucking thing
[09:47:26] <theholyduck> just to be able to do stuff

[09:47:46] <theholyduck> Nanobot: :D
[09:48:49] <theholyduck> if you want to have a reasonable linux desktop experience with actual up to date applications you generally have to do a full upgrade every other year in my experience
[09:48:59] <theholyduck> or run a rolling distro that can have a tendency to bork
[09:49:15] <amigojapan> If you could buy a tpm card I would not mind so much theholyduck

[09:50:13] <ButterNoodle> its 20$
[09:50:16] <theholyduck> except it uses a special header
[09:50:19] <theholyduck> on your motherboard
[09:50:36] <theholyduck> but many motherboards for cpus that dont have built in TPM
[09:50:42] <theholyduck> do have a socket where you can add a tpm module
[09:50:42] <amigojapan> That's not a PCI card
[09:50:56] <ButterNoodle> how old a computer we talkin?
[09:51:00] <theholyduck> sure. i THINK its a security thing
[09:51:12] <ButterNoodle> tpm headers have been on computers since 2014.. or even earlier
[09:51:17] <theholyduck> like the pci-e bus isnt very secure i dont think
[09:51:25] <ButterNoodle> ^
[09:51:31] <theholyduck> which is why they need a special port for it
[09:52:09] <theholyduck> amigojapan: but yeah like microsoft has been telegraphing the TPM thing since windows vista
[09:52:10] <ButterNoodle> and why would you want to give up a pcie for something that takes 8 pins on a header

[09:53:03] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: cause it is universally compatible
[09:53:06] <ButterNoodle> yea but I wanna run win11 on my core 2 duo with 4 gig of ram
[09:53:16] <DunceCotus> the TPM thing is purely so they can scam people in buying new hardware
[09:53:16] <ButterNoodle> so is tpm
[09:53:23] <DunceCotus> which is guaranteed money to microsoft
[09:53:29] <theholyduck> DunceCotus: microsoft doesnt get a cut of any of that though
[09:53:37] <rando25892> i think its actually security buffer type design
[09:53:38] <amigojapan> No it is not ButterNoodle 
[09:53:41] <ButterNoodle> yea this is not a good argument
[09:53:42] <DunceCotus> theholyduck: they do if the hardware includes OEM windows
[09:53:42] <theholyduck> intel/amd/asus/asrock arent giving a dollar to microsoft
[09:53:47] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: tpm is a standard
[09:54:03] <theholyduck> DunceCotus: they give absurd deals to system integrators to include it last i checked
[09:54:16] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I am saying it is not something you can upgrade to on an old machine
[09:54:26] <ButterNoodle> and like I said before.. ms would make more money if they could just sell more retail copies @150 a pop rather than 20$ per to an oem..
[09:54:26] <theholyduck> and they gave away windows 10 for free. and windows 11 for free if your hardware can be made support to 
[09:54:28] <DunceCotus> theholyduck: it may not pay them at first, but over time it could
[09:54:28] <theholyduck> amigojapan: but it is
[09:54:35] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  is what we are saying
[09:54:46] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: if they had a TPM PCI card I wood not mind
[09:54:52] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: amigo if ur old machine doesnt have a tpm header.. it would probably not meet the requirements
[09:55:17] <amigojapan> Right ButterNoodle and that is why I am angry
[09:55:19] <theholyduck> DunceCotus:  meh. they keep giving away the os for free. os money is not how they make money anymore
[09:55:23] <theholyduck> having the store. 
[09:55:25] <ButterNoodle> but I bet u can still install it
[09:55:33] <theholyduck> amigojapan: by meet the requirements hes talking like
[09:55:38] <theholyduck> have enough ram to even fucking boot
[09:55:38] <ButterNoodle> and have a great ms experience
[09:55:51] <DunceCotus> theholyduck: im not sure how they make money anymore
[09:55:55] <DunceCotus> probably mostly ad revenue
[09:56:10] <ButterNoodle> literally tpm has been on motherboards since haswell... maybe even earlier on some Z series boards
[09:56:12] <theholyduck> DunceCotus:  their own version of the appstore i imagine.
[09:56:21] <theholyduck> amigojapan: i dont understand your confusion
[09:56:24] <DunceCotus> theholyduck: yeah but who buys off appstore :S
[09:56:25] <theholyduck> you can take your old computer 
[09:56:25] <ButterNoodle> DunceCotus: selling MS teams to corperations
[09:56:38] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  and buy an add on card for it
[09:56:38] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: ah
[09:56:40] <theholyduck> to get TPM
[09:56:44] <amigojapan> theholyduck: what confusion. I am not confused
[09:56:48] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  why does that add on card have to be pci?
[09:57:11] <theholyduck> again PCI has security issues
[09:57:14] <amigojapan> theholyduck: cause that would be universally compatible
[09:57:25] <theholyduck> so its probably better the security module isnt on the pci bus
[09:57:35] <theholyduck> the TPM module is as good as universaly compatible
[09:57:41] <theholyduck> sure you cant run it on a 2004 computer or something
[09:57:47] <theholyduck> but you cant boot windows 10 or even windows 8
[09:57:49] <theholyduck> on a 2004 computer
[09:57:51] <theholyduck> so who the fuck cares
[09:57:58] <theholyduck> why does windows 11 need to work on it
[09:58:39] <rando25892> cause dr phil wants it to
[09:58:40] <amigojapan> theholyduck: it sounds just be optional
[09:59:09] <theholyduck> amigojapan: i mean it IS optional if you a) buy windows 11 and b) agree that hey its not going to work well
[09:59:11] * MootPoot just toggled on the firmware TPM on is i5 9400 system
[09:59:18] *** Joins: CyberTailor (~cyber@gateway/tor-sasl/cybertailor)
[09:59:23] <rando25892> its updates if you were genuiningly doing windows properly..
[09:59:37] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  they made it so you can install windows 11 from scratch 
[09:59:39] <amigojapan> theholyduck: if you have a computer with Tpm 2.0 then it should take effect. If you don't it should not
[09:59:40] <theholyduck> on your own risk
[10:00:08] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  too much backwards compatibility create security risks and issues
[10:00:12] <theholyduck> the whole point of doing this is to AVOID those problems
[10:00:13] <amigojapan> theholyduck: that is not a good option
[10:00:22] <theholyduck> amigojapan: why is it not a good option?
[10:00:36] <theholyduck> why must you be allowed to freely upgrade to windows 11 from windows 10 
[10:00:44] <amigojapan> theholyduck: why should I agree that I can't get updates
[10:00:58] <theholyduck> when its not going to be a good experience to do so
[10:01:33] <amigojapan> theholyduck: it's just planned obsolescence
[10:01:55] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  that im mostly all for. because windows really needs to step up its security game
[10:02:11] <theholyduck> by doing the pretty hard force of tpm 2.0 on windows 11
[10:02:17] <theholyduck> windows 12 can have a 100% force on TPM stuff
[10:02:21] <theholyduck> and get better security
[10:02:29] <MootPoot> its not planned obsolecence if the computers themselves would be effectively useless for running windows 11 anyway
[10:02:33] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  like they have been doing what you suggested. 
[10:02:35] <theholyduck> since vista
[10:03:00] <amigojapan> theholyduck: Microsoft had said win 10 would be the final version of Windows too
[10:03:08] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  they did say that yes :P
[10:03:16] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  and then it turns out they need to do a hard fork like this
[10:03:23] <theholyduck> to get away from all the old insecure stuff
[10:03:25] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  why is that relavant; I know they changed their mind, but I dont see the reason why you keep mentioning it
[10:03:29] <theholyduck> people are running windows 10.
[10:03:30] <DunceCotus> well Windows 11 is basically Windows 10
[10:03:49] <MootPoot> How does windows 10 being the claimed "last version of windows" have to do with this conversation
[10:03:50] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they are liars
[10:04:06] <DunceCotus> I think its either a money-making thing or they wanted to change the UI of 10 too much to be just another update
[10:04:09] <theholyduck> amigojapan: no. they just realized they couldnt implement the TPM change theyw anted. 
[10:04:15] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  what does them lying have to do with the TPM change lol
[10:04:16] <theholyduck> DunceCotus: its about the tpm change i think
[10:04:31] <theholyduck> by doing a version change
[10:04:32] <DunceCotus> theholyduck: I see
[10:04:35] <theholyduck> they can force the TPM module
[10:04:44] <theholyduck> which they really need to keep up with google and apple 
[10:04:45] <DunceCotus> there's definitely a focus on TPM 2.
[10:04:53] <theholyduck> in terms of os security
[10:05:08] <theholyduck> like your iphone or your android phone or your chromebook and i THINK your imac
[10:05:14] <theholyduck> all do some version of what the TPM module does
[10:05:18] <MootPoot> There is a lot of stuff that they are implementing that relies on a working TPM module
[10:05:30] <MootPoot> like all their fancy sandboxing and running memory encryption
[10:05:31] <theholyduck> microsoft is being left behind in the security game 
[10:05:45] <theholyduck> windows 11 is about mitigating that
[10:05:58] <theholyduck> and to mitigate that they basicly need to force people to actually enable/use the TPM stuff
[10:06:22] <theholyduck> which i generally think is a great thing
[10:06:47] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  i think if they could have done the TPM force without changing the version label i think they would have
[10:06:50] <theholyduck> and kept calling it windows 10
[10:07:04] <theholyduck> but at some point they realized that they needed to seperate who got the new security features 
[10:07:18] <theholyduck> since they required the TPM stuff. and so they had to make that windows 11
[10:07:31] <rando25892> their security is obscurity
[10:07:44] <theholyduck> i mean the TPM is anything but security by obscurity
[10:08:11] <rando25892> but they pay people to fix the holes which is sounds right
[10:08:15] <theholyduck> its the sort of stuff allready being used on real servers and for virtualization and on like goverment agency computers
[10:08:30] <theholyduck> they are just bringing that level of security to the desktop
[10:09:10] <amigojapan> theholyduck: I did not ask for that
[10:09:24] <theholyduck> amigojapan: well too bad. the world really needs that
[10:09:37] <theholyduck> amigojapan: theres so many people falling victim to all sorts of trojans and ransomware and shit 
[10:09:40] <theholyduck> every fucking day
[10:10:08] <theholyduck> amigojapan: like microsoft has TRIED being polite about getting TPM stuff into windows
[10:10:23] <theholyduck> for like 14 years now?
[10:10:36] <theholyduck> back when vista came out is when they started mandating manufacturers start shipping with TPM 
[10:10:38] <theholyduck> for computers
[10:11:06] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  they have been trying to be more and more forceful about it every version of windows since then
[10:11:25] <theholyduck> amigojapan: so they ahve been trying to get this shit turned on for everyone for... 14 years now
[10:11:34] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  now they are like. fuck it. hard fork
[10:11:42] <theholyduck> windows 10 for anyone who cant or wont do the TPM stuff
[10:11:48] <theholyduck> windows 11 for anyone who can or will
[10:12:03] <theholyduck> i really wish they hadnt backttracked at all on taht
[10:12:11] <MootPoot> I mean, amigojapan , if you didn't ask for it, and you don't like it, you can do what all the other people do who dont like windows or microsoft ; Move to linux :P
[10:12:16] <amigojapan> theholyduck: that would be fine if Windows 10 was supposed forever
[10:12:48] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I don't want Windows for vrchat
[10:12:50] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  again i think the only reason they thought windows 10 would be forever is they thought they could get users to enable TPM 
[10:12:51] <DunceCotus> can you give me one last kiss

[10:13:35] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  like my computer is only a couple of years old and it shipped with TPM disabled
[10:13:45] <MootPoot> They dont even need to force manufacturers to do it now that cpu fTPMS are standards
[10:13:54] <theholyduck> sure but they still need to turn it on
[10:13:56] <theholyduck> in the configs

[10:14:09] <theholyduck> *14 years
[10:14:14] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  it was optional on vista
[10:14:18] <theholyduck> it was optional on windows 7
[10:14:21] <theholyduck> it was optional on windows 8
[10:14:24] <theholyduck> it was optional on windows 8.1
[10:14:28] <theholyduck> it was optional in windows 10
[10:14:36] <theholyduck> its no longer optimal
[10:14:38] <theholyduck> you had 14 years
[10:14:39] <amigojapan> And it could continue to be optional
[10:14:43] <theholyduck> amigojapan: it really cant
[10:14:53] <theholyduck> they got basicly nowhere
[10:14:54] <theholyduck> in 14 years
[10:15:01] <theholyduck> of making it optional
[10:15:06] <theholyduck> its now a REQUIREMENT
[10:15:10] <MootPoot> This is the kind of "optional" that they should have made leaded fuel optional
[10:15:24] <MootPoot> there has to be a hard cutoff point
[10:15:35] <amigojapan> theholyduck: the computers have tpm 1.2 with no problem
[10:15:40] <MootPoot> just because your 1920s beater wont run anymore easily is a extremely minor downside 
[10:15:46] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  you can update 1.2 to 2.0
[10:15:50] <MootPoot> with a flash
[10:16:13] <amigojapan> MootPoot: some people still run retro cars somehow
[10:16:20] <MootPoot> But you also need all the extra instruction sets for modern cpus to handle on the fly encryption
[10:16:26] <theholyduck> amigojapan: sure. but you know what they do
[10:16:28] <theholyduck> they take the engines appart
[10:16:33] <theholyduck> and replace the valvestems
[10:16:41] <theholyduck> so they can run on unleaded petrol
[10:16:50] <theholyduck> *valveseats
[10:16:51] <theholyduck> :P
[10:17:05] <theholyduck> its the equilent of opening your computer and fitting a TPM module in the TPM slot
[10:17:19] <theholyduck> or upgrading your TPM firmware to 2.0
[10:17:46] <amigojapan> theholyduck: except my computer does not have such a slot I don't think
[10:17:56] <theholyduck> what computer motherboard do you have?
[10:18:00] <ButterNoodle> can you be bothered to look it up?
[10:18:10] <amigojapan> Fujitsu
[10:18:13] <ButterNoodle> its a business style
[10:18:15] <theholyduck> thats not a motherboard
[10:18:25] <theholyduck> or are you saying you have a laptop?
[10:18:37] <amigojapan> No it's a PC
[10:18:47] <theholyduck> ok so you have a fjitsu oem prebuilt?
[10:18:49] <theholyduck> how old is it?
[10:18:53] <amigojapan> But I would need to look it up
[10:18:54] <theholyduck> or what is it model nomber
[10:19:10] <theholyduck> microsoft have been requring TPM modules in OEM prebuilts since the stone age
[10:19:25] <amigojapan> theholyduck: it has a 4th Gen Intel processor
[10:19:26] <theholyduck> for them to be allowed to ship windows with it

[10:22:52] <amigojapan> Alright ButterNoodle

[10:23:27] <theholyduck> i mean looking at it yeah i dont htink you meet the CPU instruction requirements
[10:23:39] <MootPoot> 50% load at idle lmao
[10:23:40] <theholyduck> but it definitly has atleast tpm 1.2
[10:23:49] <ButterNoodle> *must have MMX
[10:23:49] <theholyduck> and DELL atleast is offering tpm 1.2 to 2.0 upgrades
[10:23:54] <ButterNoodle> how dare they
[10:23:55] <theholyduck> sooo if fujitsu DOESNT thats on them
[10:24:34] <theholyduck> amigojapan:  odds are you arent going ot have a great time missing the required CPU instructions anwyay
[10:25:00] <theholyduck> according to microsoft themselfs atleast cpus below the required thresholds do way more crashing
[10:25:04] <theholyduck> than any of the other ones
[10:25:14] <MootPoot> amigo wants to go back to the 8086 instruction set
[10:25:35] <theholyduck> doing some CPU instructions min reqs is honestly pretty smart anyway
[10:25:37] <amigojapan> I want upgrading to end
[10:25:39] <ButterNoodle> 3dnow? how about 3dnever?
[10:25:52] <theholyduck> most software isnt x264  
[10:25:57] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  then that means you want human progress to end
[10:26:03] <theholyduck> x264 like has all handwritten asm for many different levels of cpu instructions
[10:26:03] <MootPoot> we should have all stayed monkeys
[10:26:08] <amigojapan> Yes MootPoot 
[10:26:11] <theholyduck> and then automatically picks the best one for your system
[10:26:16] * MootPoot turns amigojapan  into a monkey
[10:26:19] * ButterNoodle flings a turd and some semen at MootPoot 
[10:26:22] <theholyduck> so like it might ahve a MMX and an AVX and SSE3 version
[10:26:26] <theholyduck> of at the same function
[10:26:34] * MootPoot catches it and then rubs it on himself 
[10:26:40] <theholyduck> but most software and i dont think any compilers
[10:26:42] <theholyduck> do smart stuff like that
[10:26:58] <rando25892> so win 11 is not release even yet?
[10:27:14] <rando25892> yea
[10:27:17] <rando25892> its not out
[10:27:18] <theholyduck> so by setting a threshold that all CPUs will atleast support these extensions it helps people making software actually target some of them

[11:15:30] <DunceCotus> its been so long since cicadas sang here
[11:15:42] <DunceCotus> I remember them in summer growing up in the 90s
[11:15:46] <DunceCotus> and then they just disappeared
[11:15:51] <DunceCotus> nary a cicada shell
[11:17:32] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in Japan there are millions on one tree and they don't rest at night
[11:18:23] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I can see how that could become tiresome
[11:18:36] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: do they sound like they do in NGE?
[11:18:51] <amigojapan> Yes DunceCotus 
[11:19:05] <DunceCotus> also interesting is how their 'song' seems to be regionally specific

[11:19:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: cause while I recognised the noise of cicadas in NGE, I was like.. that's not how they sing
[11:19:54] <DunceCotus> but apparently they sing differently in Japan
[11:20:24] <amigojapan> Yeah, different parts of Japan also sound different
[11:20:32] <DunceCotus> you're in Tokyo right?

[11:25:06] <amigojapan> Yup DunceCotus 
[11:26:20] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: yeah. I want to write a story about the harshness of nature

[11:28:02] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: one has to wonder if it needs to be this way
[11:28:09] <DunceCotus> or is this some kind of bugged universe

[11:30:05] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: maybe the sense of compassion is the bug?
[11:30:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: maybe
[11:30:30] <DunceCotus> all I know is the universe is impersonal
[11:30:45] <amigojapan> Yup sure seems that way
[11:31:33] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: so I don't know what we're doing here really
[11:31:40] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: if it is impersonal at least nobody is hurting anyone on purpose(in the natural world, like natural disasters)
[11:31:47] <DunceCotus> perhaps its our job to make universe 'good' somehow
[11:32:27] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well the impersonal can be worse in a way
[11:32:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: we are here as parts of the universe observing and documenting the universe
[11:32:35] <DunceCotus> like hurting on purpose at least has some meaning xD
[11:32:40] <DunceCotus> even if its a selfish meaning
[11:33:04] <amigojapan> I prefer impersonal cause of suffering
[11:33:14] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the extent of the impersonal-ness of the universe can be despairing
[11:33:54] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I mean if the universe were 'evil' and hurting on purpose, we could maybe combat that
[11:33:57] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it would be worse if someone was causing the pain
[11:33:59] <DunceCotus> so it would give inherent meaning
[11:34:02] <DunceCotus> but its not like that :/
[11:34:27] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well you'd think that, but at least we'd have a goal
[11:34:38] <DunceCotus> that is to say, to fight that someone
[11:34:42] <DunceCotus> or stop them
[11:34:50] <DunceCotus> but in an impersonal universe its sorta like.. nihilistic
[11:35:22] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: we can and have stopped certain kinds of suffering
[11:35:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: sure
[11:35:58] <DunceCotus> I think only an impersonal universe may allow for meaning perhaps
[11:36:12] <DunceCotus> but on some layers it seems to resist meaning-making
[11:36:26] <DunceCotus> like antagonistic to sense or meaning-making

[12:07:27] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I think by 'auto-production' I mean in some ways we desire to be human
[12:07:42] <DunceCotus> so although our parents still have to give birth to us, its not so much them creating us

[12:10:08] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but things are more complicated than our personal desires
[12:10:17] <DunceCotus> there's desire in the abstract sense to think about, which is unconscious
[12:12:09] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well its complicated by the fact that our personal desires are often unconsciously undercut by repression of those desires
[12:12:24] <DunceCotus> so if we desired something without undercutting it, we would get it
[12:13:09] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I am aware of some thing I really desire unconsciously. I dream about it almost every day. But it seems very hard for it to come true
[12:13:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: think of it like you want to win the lottery but unconsciously you don't expect to win, or you think you don't deserve to win etc.

[12:14:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the repression often comes part and parcel with a repressive socius (social body)
[12:15:08] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: so you are saying if I could expect to win and think I deserve it, I wood automatically win it with no problem?
[12:15:31] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: granted there's nothing else holding that desire back, yes
[12:15:44] <amigojapan> I see
[12:16:03] <DunceCotus> there could be other factors, like fear of who you might become with that much money all of a sudden
[12:16:13] <DunceCotus> or fear of others wanting a piece of it etc.
[12:16:29] <amigojapan> I see
[12:16:57] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: probability doesn't really come into desire
[12:17:05] <DunceCotus> but what does come into it is how desiring-machines are connected up
[12:17:21] <DunceCotus> which affects how desire flows (or is redirected)
[12:18:09] <DunceCotus> that's why the exceedingly unlikely event of our existence is guaranteed when desire is flowing in a certain way
[12:19:59] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: this is how anything new is created

[12:24:53] <DunceCotus> compelling
[12:25:11] <amigojapan> Yeah I meant compelling in what way

[12:25:43] <DunceCotus> the connection between ontogenesis and desire
[12:26:51] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: you would not be able to get the lottery anyway even if you are right. You would stop yourself. And the desires of others would too
[12:27:26] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the desire of others is not disconnected to our own
[12:27:42] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but yes, there are many obstacles to such a desire
[12:27:48] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: however people still win the lottery
[12:28:04] <DunceCotus> would be interesting to analyse these winners, how they think (how they desire)
[12:28:20] <DunceCotus> they probably had no expectation of winning (but no expectation of losing either)
[12:28:21] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I wood rather discover a huge block of gold under a rock
[12:28:48] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: there is a woman that won the lottery like 4 times
[12:29:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: yeah but unconscious knowing about probabilities will prevent that
[12:29:20] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: that's why kids can often desire more 'purely' or 'intensely'
[12:29:27] <DunceCotus> cause they have less social hang-ups or expectations
[12:29:59] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: right, and such an event is exceedingly improbable
[12:30:09] <DunceCotus> 4 times winning already an exceedingly improbable thing
[12:30:18] <DunceCotus> something else is involved.
[12:30:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: thinking of so much gold that must exist out there in putter space and out of my reach pisses me off
[12:30:52] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: anything can be created any time
[12:31:11] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: we just have a fucktonne (excuse the french) of blockages
[12:31:11] <amigojapan> Outer space
[12:31:35] <DunceCotus> blockages in part due to trying to come to consensus about reality
[12:31:56] <DunceCotus> however the consensus can often limit possibilities
[12:32:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: that's another reason I think our births are a bit misleading
[12:32:55] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: the human form we are currently in is a result of both desire and its blockages
[12:32:57] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: so many people hope God exists. Your theory means their wishes should make him actually exist
[12:33:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: to a certain extent yes
[12:33:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but there are blockages there too
[12:34:22] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: besides there may not be a difference between pure desire for God and actually just being God
[12:34:35] <DunceCotus> God desiring-to-be
[12:35:31] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: like haruhi we are god's but we don't know if?
[12:36:01] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: well we are not Gods but that's part of our desire
[12:36:13] <DunceCotus> so if we wanted to be Gods, that would also be a desire thing
[12:36:31] <amigojapan> I see

[13:00:36] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: if there is a desire for a perfect heaven?

[13:01:15] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there are likely too many blockages for a perfect heaven, hence why we're here
[13:01:27] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: so we get a compromise?
[13:01:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: not always
[13:02:25] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: another thing to consider is how desire is (auto-)produced

[13:08:40] <DunceCotus> sure
[13:08:46] <amigojapan> Ok
[13:09:31] <DunceCotus> death I think can be a strong reconfiguring attractor
[13:09:35] <DunceCotus> SRA
[13:09:52] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: desiring-production can be modified upon death (and may have to be)
[13:10:12] <DunceCotus> as life desires life
[13:10:24] <DunceCotus> and death acts as a blockage, it will try to alleviate the blockage
[13:11:03] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: if you desire total annihilation?
[13:11:20] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: once again its not so much about your conscious desire
[13:11:25] <DunceCotus> as it is unconscious desire
[13:11:32] <amigojapan> Ok
[13:11:33] <DunceCotus> conscious desire is tied up with eo
[13:11:35] <DunceCotus> *ego
[13:11:46] <amigojapan> I see
[13:12:33] <DunceCotus> fear is probably what keeps us in poor desiring-modes
[13:13:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but so can hope
[13:13:48] <DunceCotus> it may be important to strip ourselves of both hope and fear
[13:13:58] <DunceCotus> if we wish to have something resembling 'heaven'
[13:14:40] <DunceCotus> and I don't think desiring no-ego is necessary for this
[13:14:53] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: if nobody is unfailable and God exists but is unfailable then God is actually nobody.
[13:14:54] <DunceCotus> ego death can cause more issues

[13:15:37] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: you may be waiting a long time
[13:16:04] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: yeah like 37 years more
[13:16:17] <DunceCotus> I think given the 'amnesiac' nature of incarnation it is likely we won't experience our death 
[13:16:32] <DunceCotus> but rather strong 'religious' or 'spiritual' experiences, and then integrating that into more life
[13:17:19] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its also worth considering time-between-time
[13:17:40] <amigojapan> What?
[13:17:46] <DunceCotus> like there was a point in my life where I started feeling like i've been alive for much longer than my biological age
[13:18:06] <amigojapan> Ok
[13:18:19] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: to a certain extent our biological existence is illusory
[13:18:29] <DunceCotus> and therefore so is the timeline associated with it
[13:19:24] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: can I meet my parents again?
[13:19:32] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I've had psychedelic experiences where a minute is stretched out to what is perceived to be longer than minute
[13:19:47] <DunceCotus> this is what I mean by time-between-time
[13:19:55] <amigojapan> I see
[13:20:00] <DunceCotus> a sort of time outside the consensual flow
[13:20:21] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: you probably can/will
[13:20:27] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: but I'm not sure in what form
[13:20:46] <DunceCotus> but remember its not about probabilities
[13:20:59] <amigojapan> Ok DunceCotus 
[13:21:31] <DunceCotus> and the unconscious knows no time
[13:21:39] <DunceCotus> because its made up of atemporal asignifying signs
[13:21:56] <DunceCotus> time is specific to certain modes of desiring-production
[13:23:12] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I wonder if that's what Jung was referring to about 'archetypes'
[13:23:49] <amigojapan> I should read Jung DunceCotus 
[13:24:32] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: me too

[13:32:46] <DunceCotus> Freud and Jung are still immeasurably useful
[13:33:01] <DunceCotus> even if ultimately their theories are not the whole story, they lay foundation for good work
[13:33:21] <DunceCotus> like Darwin
[13:33:24] <DunceCotus> or Einstein
[13:33:34] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: Freud is used against suicided. But he suicided himself. I don't believe in psychoanalysis
[13:33:50] <DunceCotus> psychoanalysis has a lot of faults sure
[13:34:06] <amigojapan> Ok

[13:51:49] <amigojapan> PancakeMatsuri: in my experience, make anxiety and depression much more tolerable
[13:52:24] <PancakeMatsuri> amigojapan ahh, that's great. I use binaural beats for anxiety
[13:52:49] <PancakeMatsuri> isochronic too
[13:52:51] <amigojapan> Sounds like a game
[13:53:00] <PancakeMatsuri> it isn't a game

[14:30:42] <Berlin36> holy shit, today i had a dream, and i realised in the dream that it was a dream
[14:31:01] <Berlin36> i was so happy in that dream realising that, but then i don't remember anything
[14:31:22] <Berlin36> i was like: OMG I REALISED IT'S A DREAM, IM IN A DREAM NOW!!!
[14:32:23] <DunceCotus> Berlin36: that's when you can take conscious control of the dream
[14:32:25] <amigojapan> Berlin36: it's usual to wake up when you realise it is a dream
[14:32:44] <Berlin36> i tried to imagine i had some wings and stuff

[14:33:34] <Berlin36> or maybe
[14:33:36] <Berlin36> :(
[14:33:52] <Berlin36> i had also a dream when i realised it was a dream, but i was like half awake
[14:33:56] <Berlin36> and then i woke but
[14:34:02] <Berlin36> this was different
[14:34:51] <Berlin36> i wanna have some control over some of my dreams, because at the moment everything feels so realistic!!

[16:06:52] <MootPoot> 1080p mkvs
[16:06:52] <JesseDesu> 90gb is like the entire haruhi remastered edition
[16:06:58] <death916> 90gb alot for anime
[16:07:06] <JesseDesu> depends who compresses it
[16:07:10] <death916> i jsu doewnlaod all of org dragonball and gundam zeta
[16:07:11] <JesseDesu> if they compress it at all
[16:07:20] <MootPoot> fortunately I have gigabit internet
[16:07:23] <MootPoot> so it shouldn't take too long
[16:07:29] <MootPoot> maybe 30min
[16:07:31] <JesseDesu> i downloaded all of hyouka for 6gb
[16:07:44] <death916> a seems like they r using not very compressed stuff

[16:48:53] <Roey> not just speakin
[16:48:58] <Roey> I mean, as well as speaking
[16:49:44] <amigojapan> By phone I can read and write. But not by hand
[16:50:08] <Roey> ok
[16:50:17] <Roey> can you read literary boks?
[16:50:27] <Roey> like, high Japanese
[16:50:28] <Roey> ?
[16:50:48] <Roey> or technical Japanese / business Japanese?
[16:50:50] <amigojapan> I have but tried to do that much
[16:50:54] <Roey> aye
[16:51:01] <amigojapan> Technical Japanese I can read
[16:51:20] <Roey> ok
[16:51:34] <amigojapan> Business I probably don't understand well in any language
[16:51:42] <Roey> :)
[16:51:44] <Roey> heh
[16:51:49] <Roey> business spanish
[16:52:07] <Roey> can you understand it?
[16:52:11] <Sadale> What's the difference between business japanaese and normal japanese?
[16:52:16] <Sadale> and technical japanese
[16:52:27] <amigojapan> Probably it wood be hard Roey 
[16:52:33] <Roey> !!
[16:52:50] <Roey> Sadale: so business language has a lot of abstract concepts
[16:53:02] <Sadale> like what?
[16:53:06] <Roey> Sadale: and technical language has a lot of concrete, exact language
[16:53:08] <amigojapan> Sadale: Â∞ÇÈñÄÁî®Ë™û
[16:53:12] <Sadale> jargon?
[16:53:17] <Roey> more thanjargon
[16:53:19] <amigojapan> Yup
[16:53:25] <Roey> it's again level of abstractness/concreteness
[16:53:25] * Sadale scratces his head :/
[16:53:50] <Roey> in technicla language you describe things on low-level scale
[16:54:34] <Sadale> ah. I kind of get the idea. Those kind of confusing wordings for business management that you won't ever understand.
[16:54:48] <Roey> affix the pin block aseembly to the mating receptacle leaving no room for clearance
[16:54:54] <Roey> business language is abstract
[16:55:22] <Berlin36> can i enter one irc account from my phone and laptop simultaneously ?
[16:55:29] <Roey> our solution will maximize the gains you're looking to achieve with your current production processes
[16:55:35] <Roey> Sadale: ^ do you see now?
[16:56:13] <Sadale> Roey, ah. So it's just jargon :P
[16:56:26] <Roey> no it's more
[16:56:27] <Roey> like I said:
[16:56:34] <Roey> in the first example it's talking about actual shit
[16:56:35] <Sadale> I get your idea tho
[16:56:38] <Sadale> I know I kknow
[16:56:45] <Roey> in the second example it's talking about concepts
[16:56:49] <Roey> that are vaguely defined
[16:57:01] <Roey> :)
[16:58:06] <Sadale> I didn't know that this kind of stuff is called business language tho. I thought that business language was just like workplace language.
[17:00:01] <Roey> Sadale: there are certain modes of talkikng when you're at work
[17:00:02] <Roey> certainly
[17:00:09] <mixfix41> hostile takeover is a business term
[17:00:13] <mixfix41> i think of that :)
[17:00:23] <mixfix41> it is interesting people do videos on youtube
[17:00:33] <Sadale> I've never worked in those higher positions. To me I just use whatever wordings I've got in mind.
[17:00:54] <Sadale> From my observation tho different people using different words. And some are better in communicating with others than some other people.
[17:01:21] <Roey> Imagine writing a letter to everyone at your job thanking them for the wonderful time they've shown you at your five years at this company, as you move on to bigger and better things at your new company
[17:01:28] <Roey> that's business english
[17:02:01] <MootPoot> basically "fuck you guys lmao I'm outta here"
[17:03:14] <Roey> yes but diplomaticlaly
[17:03:19] <Roey> diplomatically

[18:52:36] <Sadale> Berlin36, I'd turn down the brightness if I turn off the light

[18:53:44] <Berlin36> if i would use light theme, then ill use it only with redshift
[18:53:51] <MootPoot> Hmm
[18:53:54] <Berlin36> i use it right now
[18:53:56] <Sadale> Berlin36, by redshift did you mean that the screen would turn into a red tone when you're at night or low brightness?
[18:54:01] <MootPoot> Sadale: you live in HK right
[18:54:01] <Berlin36> yes
[18:54:03] <Sadale> I honestly hate this feature.
[18:54:06] <Berlin36> why tho
[18:54:08] <Sadale> MootPoot, yep
[18:54:10] <Berlin36> i love it
[18:54:14] <MootPoot> Btw I hear redshift is a good movie
[18:54:16] <Berlin36> it makes everything feel softer
[18:54:17] <Sadale> Berlin36, lol it blinds my eyes xD
[18:54:27] <Berlin36> Sadale, you are an alien
[18:54:34] <Berlin36> ladies and gentlemen...
[18:54:36] <MootPoot> Sadale: how hard is it to get food that's vegetarian there
[18:54:39] <Berlin36> we got him
[18:54:40] <Sadale> I'm simply not used to it. My eyes feel strained for watching screen in red tone
[18:54:56] <darkpeach> aliens are good people
[18:55:06] <Berlin36> aliens != people
[18:55:10] <Sadale> MootPoot, if you're willing to pay extra, you can find vegetarian meals here.
[18:55:16] <MootPoot> Or is 99% of the food have meat like in the us
[18:55:17] <darkpeach> it is more orange than red
[18:55:23] <Berlin36> yes
[18:55:24] <darkpeach> I always use it
[18:55:26] <MootPoot> Sadale: do you have to go out of your way
[18:55:34] <Berlin36> it is just a bit softer and a bit more orange
[18:55:38] <Berlin36> try it
[18:55:42] <MootPoot> I'm not vegetarian but I eat meat sparingly
[18:55:48] <Berlin36> i use it like this: redshift -O 4500
[18:55:50] <Sadale> MootPoot, either would work. Some restaurant offers vegetarian meals.'
[18:55:54] <MootPoot> Maybe a few times a month
[18:56:47] <darkpeach> blue light late at night messes with my sleep, so it's a useful thing, even if it doesn't look good
[18:56:51] <Sadale> MootPoot, Even Mcdonalds has salad. But the thing is that you'd have to pay extra. In some restaurants, it's a bit more expensive than regular meal. Funny how in some other restaurants tho, vegetarian meals are actually cheaper
[18:57:06] <MootPoot> I don't know why people started to eat meat like with every meal
[18:57:18] <MootPoot> Huh
[18:57:28] <Sadale> to me, tea and caffaine and shit fucks up my sleep far worse than blue light
[18:57:31] <Sadale> Maybe I'm alien xD
[18:57:35] <Berlin36> yes Sadale
[18:57:39] <Berlin36> pepsi too
[18:57:40] <Berlin36> -.-
[18:57:47] <darkpeach> maybe we are all aliens
[18:57:48] <Berlin36> but not tea
[18:57:50] <Berlin36> tea is okay
[18:57:52] <Sadale> MootPoot, same here. For non-vagetarian meal, there's barely any veggie inside :(
[18:58:05] <darkpeach> not all tea is ok
[18:58:12] <Berlin36> welp
[18:58:13] <Berlin36> yes
[18:58:40] <darkpeach> they can have different amounts of caffeine
[18:59:11] <MootPoot> Is food expensive there?

[18:59:46] <Berlin36> nono  Urchin
[18:59:46] <Sadale> MootPoot, Depending on the restaurant. Anyway it's cheaper than north america cities.

[19:03:59] <Sadale> MootPoot, There're restaurants that's more expensive. Some people are used to ordering from those restaurants, which I find not worth the price. For "normal" restaurants that people have on day-to-day basis, I've seen meals costing $13.

[19:38:26] <amigojapan> Sadale: ancient Jews counted data from sundown to sundown
[19:38:47] <Sadale> I count day from sleep to sleep. xD
[19:38:50] <amigojapan> Days not data
[19:38:52] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: anyway, amigo is really correct in that it's vague and gets used differently
[19:39:22] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: but I and people I know have used "good morning" as a joke any time it's after midnight since forever
[19:39:31] <TsundereNoises> because it's TECHNICALLY morning, but not really
[19:39:42] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: exactly because of the definitional vagueness we're talking about
[19:40:36] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: but, for example, phrases like "the wee hours of the morning" have been around forever, and that refers to time before dawn, like 2 AM 
[19:40:55] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: Sadale , tomako surprised me at the beginning when she got angry when I said "see you tomorrow" after 12 midnight to some of my friends, she wanted me to say "see you later
[19:41:34] <TsundereNoises> yeah, I think this is exactly that kind of thing
[19:41:43] <amigojapan> Yup
[19:41:55] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, I see. :3
[19:42:23] <Sadale> BTW, here's why I said that I count day from sleep to sleep. I've got a log whenever I develop programs. I'll write down the date and what I've done for the day.
[19:42:26] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: I think of it like this: "morning" TECHNICALLY means any time after midnight, but in actual common usage means "when the sun is up but it isn't noon yet"
[19:42:41] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: but because of that, people use the technical definition all the time as a joke, or to emphasize how late it is
[19:42:52] <Sadale> As for the date, if I haven't slept for the day and I'm past midnight, I'd write down the date before the midnight
[19:42:54] <TsundereNoises> Sadale: also I'm tempted to get in an argument with that wikipedia page about "dawn"
[19:42:57] <Sadale> TsundereNoises, I see :3
[19:43:19] <Sadale> English's spoken everywhere. So I think it really depends on which culture you're from
[19:43:19] <TsundereNoises> because even in normal serious common ussage, dawn is when the sun actually comes up, but people ABSOLUTELY say morning once it starts to get light
[19:44:12] <TsundereNoises> there's not really a good term for that pre-dawn light in english
[19:44:53] <amigojapan> Twilight is for night
[19:45:19] <TsundereNoises> Êú™Êòé is my favorite time of day
[19:45:51] <amigojapan> Maybe there are two twilights?
[19:46:00] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: pre-dawn is the best we have I think, and that's a lame word
[19:46:03] <TsundereNoises> not cool like twilight

[20:04:45] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: some English speakers don't realise that breakfast means braking the fast
[20:05:43] <Sadale> And breakslow means breaking the slow
[20:06:03] <Sadale> If you have a quick breakfast, that's breakfast. If you have it slow that'd be breakslow :P
[20:06:17] <amigojapan> Sadale: fast as in fasting. To not eat for a long time
[20:06:44] <amigojapan> !c fasting
[20:06:45] <Sadale> If you're having breakfast with so much time that you're having it continuously, that'd be continuousfast.
[20:06:45] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: Fasting is the willful refrainment from eating and sometimes drinking. From a purely physiological context, "fasting" may refer to the metabolic status of a person who has not eaten overnight, or to the metabolic state achieved after complete digestion and absorption of a meal.
[20:07:03] <Sadale> amigojapan, lol I know I'm just joking
[20:07:11] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[20:07:34] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yes, hobbits generally go from about 7 AM to around 9 AM without eating, they need to break their fast again around then

[22:04:44] <Bco1981> that song really fits Mio's vocal range.
[22:05:50] <rando25892> TsundereNoises: this song sounds particularly good on dead speakers
[22:05:59] <TsundereNoises> I feel like I don't listen to Mio songs much, but a couple of her covers are really great
[22:06:23] <rando25892> if you have any bass blown product
[22:06:43] <TsundereNoises> rando25892: what makes a song work best on dead speakers?
[22:06:54] <rando25892> i dont know some do, (somehow)
[22:07:51] <Bco1981> but... dead speakers don't give any sound.
[22:08:15] <rando25892> i meant bass that have become distort through improper input files
[22:08:22] <Bco1981> ah
[22:08:47] <rando25892> thats why i said the bass blown line trying to fix my definition :)
[22:08:48] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: if I had no speakers, I wonder if putting hololive songs on the background would still be worth it?
[22:08:55] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: just to see the side to side motions
[22:09:36] <rando25892> most songs sound awful but the light notes come thru.....
[22:09:52] <Bco1981> once they vibe to the music like really rocking from side to side, always makes you look.

[22:22:47] <rando25892> the bass hits hard in sequences is no good..
[22:22:59] <TsundereNoises> I'm way too curious now about what works and what doesn't
[22:23:21] <rando25892> its one of those docking station speakers for the older model apple products that customers could have just pruchase a adapter for to still make use off
[22:24:31] <rando25892> its a bad design cause the power adapter gets terribly hot even when not playing it just needs power
[22:24:51] <rando25892> well not bad but its klipsch
[22:25:32] <rando25892> nice one too nice weird shape like collesium shape not ugly rectangle
[22:26:02] <rando25892> i still like the song
[22:26:09] <rando25892> all songs grow to me if i listen to it more than once..
[22:27:00] <rando25892> you can smell the speakers too cause it pops like it isnt suppose to
[22:29:00] <rando25892> thats probs my guess where a physical dash board sound would be helpful if you pull shit from older formats cause they sure can damage shit where we cant hear shit
[22:29:43] <rando25892> which is more akin to using software to fix it actually
[22:29:48] <rando25892> but the physical dash for looks
[22:31:25] <TsundereNoises> this is weirdly fascinating to me
