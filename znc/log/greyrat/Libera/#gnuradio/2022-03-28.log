[00:11:10] <monkeye> Yamakaja[m], yes that is what im doing
[00:12:01] <Yamakaja[m]> Though why send assembly, when you can send assembled machine code?
[00:12:21] <patchvonbraun[m]> Microcode or GFTO
[00:12:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> :)
[00:12:28] <monkeye> well the project is we have to decode machine code from stdin e.g. type in 4c and the program would print out ADD or whatever, 
[00:12:49] <Yamakaja[m]> Oh, project specs. Oh well ... :D
[00:12:59] <monkeye> i want to type the machine code into console and send it using rfcat to my beaglebone and have it decode it on that
[00:14:59] <Yamakaja[m]> How much experience do you have with building RF communications systems from scratch? is that even what you want to do? Do you have any existing protocols / standards in mind?
[00:15:00] <monkeye> Myon, the connection to assembly is that on my beaglebone i have to process the machine code using ARM assembly
[00:15:49] <monkeye> I have barely any experience I was hoping I could use some premade libraries or programs to assist me
[00:16:01] <monkeye> I have a month for the project at least so I could learn
[00:16:51] <Yamakaja[m]> What kind of hardware do you have available to act as transmitter and receiver?
[00:17:07] <Yamakaja[m]> And what's your formal education background?
[00:19:10] <monkeye> I have a yardstick one with rfcat firmware and an rtl sdr receiver and I am 3rd year B.S. of computing
[00:19:41] <monkeye> I was thinking about getting another yardstick one to act as the receiver as well but if its doable with an sdr I would like to save money
[00:20:18] <Myon> they are all "sdr"
[00:21:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> Actually, the YardStick one is a HARDWARE data-ratio with selectable modulations and data-rates.  It isn't an SDR in any meaningful way I think.
[00:21:34] <monkeye> sorry, RTL2838
[00:24:51] <monkeye> Kevin-phasewrap[, I have been sending test data over the yardstick one and can see it on the rtl2838 but I cant make any sense of it 
[00:25:07] <Yamakaja[m]> monkeye: Is the goal here ultimately just to involve an RF component in your project, or to actually build the communications system. Because the latter is quite hard

[00:26:38] <monkeye> the goal here is to just involve an RF component. maybe one day I would like to build the communications system but baby steps
[00:27:07] <monkeye> I got the idea from sending data to satellites 
[00:27:47] <Yamakaja[m]> Then maybe consider using established protocols and dongles like zigbee 
[00:28:24] <Myon> or wifi :)

[00:56:21] <flash[m]> as a CS project, I'd recommend just using networking rather than biting off RF, unless you are already an RF enthusiast. I'm learning/using SDR for work, and it is a steep learning curve, unless you have some footholds
[00:57:18] <flash[m]> I'd write a simple "read stdin" implementation, then you can abstract to other sources, as you have time/interest
[00:58:03] <flash[m]> seeing those kinds of abstractions ("just another input source") is a crucial software architecture skill that is sadly rare in industry
[00:59:58] <patchvonbraun[m]> The "send some bits between two computers over a casually-defined radio channel" seems to be a very-common "tinkering" for CS students and the like.  But since we already have things like LoRA and WiFi and the like, it's not particularly "interesting" except as a learning excercise.  Which is why you won't find a lot of pre-built "solutions" lying around all ready-to-go.  There are probably *dozens* of such things spinning on some
[00:59:58] <patchvonbraun[m]> no-longer-a-students disk drive that were learning exercises, but not anything you'd want to bring home to your parents, etc.
[01:01:01] <patchvonbraun[m]> AND the general set "useful and interesting things you might do at the intersection of Radio, DSP and computers" is so very very very large that hardly any of it has been written yet...
[01:09:54] <monkeye> flash[m], thank you for your advice i will take that into consideration
[01:12:42] <flash[m]> a web front-end might be more instructive, and ultimately useful in your development

[03:27:43] <catphish> if i want to receive HF / LF, can i simply connect an antenna through an amplifier to a single ADC, or am i missing something?
[03:42:12] <patchvonbraun[m]> catphish: assuming you have a fast enough ADC and a way to get those samples into your PC.
[03:42:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> And you can bandmlimit to satisfy Nyquist.
[03:43:20] <catphish> ah yes, will need a low pass filter, thanks
[03:44:12] <patchvonbraun[m]> If you want DC to 30MHz you need to sample at at least 60MHz.
[03:46:03] <catphish> patchvonbraun[m]: that's exactly what i was thinking, ideally DC to 30MHz, 65Msps ADC, haven't worked out how to get this into a PC yet :)
[03:47:02] <patchvonbraun[m]> You might need a bit of gain ahead of the ADV as well.
[03:47:15] <patchvonbraun[m]> ADC
[03:48:02] <catphish> absolutely, ADC will want 2v p-t-p, antenna will not be that :)

[03:49:04] <patchvonbraun[m]> Depends on how much of its DR you want to fill and how many bits.
[03:50:20] <catphish> well, best case scenario, 12 bit ADC, adjust gain to make full use of it, of course i'm just imagining at this point, but will try to flesh it out
[03:51:50] *** Quits: Tangent-Man (~Tang3nt-M@92.40.178.106.threembb.co.uk) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:52:10] <patchvonbraun[m]> WIth only 12-bits, you're likely going to need a switchable filter bank for HF.  One that divides HF up into perhaps 6 segments.
[03:52:11] *** Joins: Tangent-Man (~Tang3nt-M@92.40.178.104.threembb.co.uk)
[03:53:13] <catphish> why is that?
[03:53:18] <patchvonbraun[m]> The DR requirements in HF can be eye-watering, with thunder-bang loud signals right next to really weak ones.  So, either you have a filter-bank with a smaller ADC, or you up-rate your ADC by 4 bits.
[03:53:45] <catphish> i see
[03:54:08] <patchvonbraun[m]> Which is why all the commercial direct-sampling HF SDRs have 16-bit ADCs.
[03:54:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> The realizable DR from a 12-bit is perhaps 65dB of DR.  That's on the edge of not enough for HF--particularly at the low end.
[03:55:22] <catphish> i guess with a full range direct sample like this, you risk things like mains interference clipping the signal while signals you want are below a useful number of bits
[03:56:23] <catphish> i hadn't considered what a huge dynamic range i'd need but yes
[04:02:45] <catphish> an FX3 USB controller and an ADC like ADC3583 might just cut it

[04:08:53] <patchvonbraun[m]> Expect to spend more getting it working than simply buying an SDR that already does what you want...
[04:10:16] <catphish> i feel like "it'd take more time to design than to buy one" is kind of a given ;)
[04:11:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> Not just time, $$$ as well.  It'll likely require multi-layer fine-pitch boards, and you'll inevitably need a spin or three...
[04:11:44] <catphish> but i was curious what would be required, as this seemed like an obvious tool that i couldn't readily find
[04:13:45] <catphish> i have an N200, was looking at how to feed HF radio into it, it's clearly possible, but it got me wondering if something cheaper existed, since potentially no FPGA needed here
[04:15:11] <catphish> though i can now see how a narrowband ADC and tuner may make more sense
[04:15:43] <catphish> my goal right now is just to receive HF radio signals, but it got me wondering too much :)
[04:15:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> THe "softrock" approach was to use a Tayloe mixer feed an audio card where L/R were used for I/Q.
[04:16:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> The N200 can use an LFRX card...
[04:18:01] <catphish> yeah, most likely i will buy a LFRX and LNA
[04:18:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> Doesn't need to be an LNA on HF.  Just an "A" :)
[04:18:33] <catphish> :)
[04:18:50] <patchvonbraun[m]> In fact, LNAs tend to have more linearity issues than RF amps that you might use at HF.   
[04:19:08] <catphish> just needs a simple wideband opamp i guess
[04:19:27] <catphish> though this isn't something i know a huge amount about yet
[04:19:52] <patchvonbraun[m]> Not an op-amp.  Just something olde-skool like an ERA-3 from minicircuits.
[04:20:35] <patchvonbraun[m]> At HF, linearity is the dominatnig factor, since the "channel noise" vastly exceeds the electronic noise of your first RF gain stage.

[18:40:10] <catphish> i've ordered an upconverter which is guaranteed to work, but will keep a look at ways to do direct conversion on the HF because that's cooler somehow, and the Hermes Lite seem the answer to that

[19:48:02] <BarryDuggan[m]> in addition to the frequency conversion, it has a nice LNA
[19:48:29] <catphish> right, i thoght it would be an ideal way to get started, i can hook it up to my N200 or my bladerf
[19:48:54] <catphish> but long term i want to build something better on top of the N200 using LFTX and LFRX cards, the downside is that it will require a fair amount of external stuff for amplification and filtering in both directions

When I run the signal through just the low-pass-filter, I can align the data in time just using the "Filter Delay" block, however, this doesn't seem to be the case for the Polyphase Clock Sync (probably because my samples per symbol is ~8 which changes the sample rate). Does anyone
[23:21:45] <jacob_theknight[> have any recommendations on solutions? I tried inserting the Filter Delay before the Polyphase Clock Sync, but I guess it also doesn't seem to align properly...
