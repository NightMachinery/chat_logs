[20:16:44] <LTCD> Hey. Introduction to Modern Cryptography 2nd edition by Katz and Lindell PDF 79/598. Is this just saying when f is given input of some arbitrary message of fixed length ℓ then whether it outputs 0 or 1 depends on whether the i'th bit of the message is a zero or one?  f : {0, 1}^(ℓ) → {0, 1}

[21:01:12] <LTCD> hahaha
[21:02:42] <LTCD> AFAIK it just means given a message like 01000 when you do f(m) it just checks if the i'th bit of a zero or one which is easy, however when someone gives you enc(01000) it is harder to calculate f(m) given enc(01000)enc(01000)
[21:02:53] <LTCD> Doh, excuse the double paste and a missing full stop.

[22:38:26] <LTCD> Hey. Introduction to Modern Cryptography 2nd edition by Katz and Lindell PDF 79/598. Is this just saying when f is given input of some arbitrary message of fixed length ℓ then whether it outputs 0 or 1 depends on whether the i'th bit of the message is a zero or one?  f : {0, 1}^(ℓ) → {0, 1}  Here is a picture of the page:

[22:49:21] <Alipha> onelegend: i actually don't have much experience/education on the mathematical proof side of cryptography. as a software engineer, i stick mainly towards the practical application of cryptography.
[22:53:43] <onelegend> oh
[23:19:27] <Julius_> I have way too many shitcoins :(
[23:20:43] <LTCD> yawkat Mind explaining though, like what is this trying to say?
[23:21:08] <LTCD> yawkat Just before in the book it was discussing guessing the i-th bit in a binary string.
[23:21:15] <yawkat> it's an example
[23:21:22] <yawkat> f can be any function
[23:21:35] <LTCD> yawkat An overview, as I do not get the point.
[23:22:40] <LTCD> yawkat Also, the fact that the range (output) is {0,1} really makes me think this is about guessing the probability of whether the ith bit of a message is 0 or 1...
[23:23:02] <yawkat> wrong guess
[23:23:09] <yawkat> the statement has to hold for any function
[23:23:54] <yawkat> note that the actual theorem makes no mention of 'i'
[23:24:38] <Julius_> Isnt this channel about crypto "currencies" ?
[23:24:45] <ms7821> no
[23:24:46] <yawkat> no
[23:24:48] <LTCD> yawkat Just up above, on the page before it did.
[23:24:49] <LTCD> NO
[23:25:02] <yawkat> LTCD: yes, as an example, but it is not part of the theorem
[23:25:04] <Julius_> So it's about cryptography in general?
[23:25:07] <yawkat> yes
[23:25:13] <LTCD> Qui
[23:25:14] <Julius_> I dont think that cryptography exists
[23:25:20] <ms7821> yawn
[23:25:35] <ms7821> LTCD, the theorem they're working on is described by "This, what we actually want..."
[23:25:47] <Julius_> Prove me wrong if you can ... which you cant
[23:25:49] <LTCD> We cannot prove fingerprints work (seriously, no paper) yet they put people on the electric chair... same applies to crypto.
[23:25:59] <ms7821> and f is typically read as "some (any) function"
[23:26:58] <LTCD> ms7821 Could you explain what that probability statement at the bottom does then? Now I know I am wrong about it relating to the i-th bit of a message.
[23:27:00] <ms7821> so the {0, 1}^ℓ → {0, 1} is just defining the domain of the function, so you know what type of function it is

[23:27:48] <LTCD> (I did not include everything in that one image, so opening the PDF might reveal more information.)
[23:28:51] <LTCD> So since f(m) can be anything, surely as an example it could be a function which takes as input the binary string m and outputs 0 or 1 when it checks the 1-th bit... ;-)
[23:28:51] <Julius_> Why do people trust cryptography?
[23:29:11] <LTCD> Julius_ I just told you, for the same purposes people trust fingerprints which have no academic backing. 
[23:29:24] <ms7821> don't feed the troll
[23:29:28] <Julius_> LTCD, so in short "because people are idiots"
[23:29:42] <LTCD> Heck, fingerprints are less unique than MD5...
[23:29:50] <Julius_> ms7821, I am not trolling. I am just saying that there is no reason to believe that cryptography exists
[23:30:00] <yawkat> the theorem says, that any attacker with access to the ciphertext attempting to approximate any function f(m) (that may or may not reveal information on the plaintext), has no advantage over an attacker with no access to the ciphertext.
[23:30:31] <LTCD> I also made some posts in this channel the other day where I explained why Snowden was fake, but without proof I am another troll. I mean, if you have any police friends that will speak to you honestly, I can poke some holes in Snowden's lies...
[23:30:40] <Julius_> LTCD, I am pretty sure fingerprints are 100% unique, but we can't measure them exactly enough to tell the differences
[23:31:16] <ms7821> ok, I have better things to do
[23:31:33] <Julius_> ms7821, dont be pissed just because you dont like the truth
[23:31:38] <yawkat> or rather, an attacker has at most a negligible advantage
[23:31:53] <LTCD> yawkat Ohhh, so like f(m) might tell me whether the underlying plaintext is English, but this does not help me decrypt the ciphertext in a semantically secure scheme?
[23:32:45] <yawkat> no, f is not actually leaked in the real world
[23:32:49] <yawkat> f is any function
[23:33:07] <LTCD> Julius_ Nope, you have at least 1 other person in the world with the same one as you. Also, speak to forensic science people, even though they are used for sending people to the electric chair there is no academic proof they are as good as we believe. They were only invented to ensure rich people stayed in prison, back when there were not proper ID
[23:33:07] <LTCD> checks so rich people could pay for substitutes. 
[23:33:33] <Julius_> LTCD, there is no other person on this planet that has exactly the same fingerprints as you
[23:34:28] <LTCD> Julius_ Third time: yes, there is, you share a fingerprint with seven people actually (mapping is 1 match per billion people).
[23:34:59] <Julius_> LTCD, no there is not. There will always be small differences. If we can measure then is a differen question. Second time I told you
[23:35:13] <Julius_> *them
[23:35:14] <LTCD> yawkat So could you provide a pretend example for what f(m) might be?
[23:35:37] <yawkat> the point of the theorem is that it doesnt matter
[23:35:50] <Julius_> yawkat, f=0
[23:36:34] <yawkat> dutr
[23:36:37] <yawkat> sure*
[23:36:45] <yawkat> the theorem will hold
[23:37:08] <LTCD> I just like examples.
[23:37:16] <LTCD> Like, fun examples, which slot into my brain.
[23:38:21] <Julius_> yawkat, I think your theorem is wrong
[23:38:35] <Julius_> I can even prove it
[23:39:24] <yawkat> well, if you set f to be f(m)=m_0, and apply the theorem, you can show that the attacker cannot determine the first bit. similar for the other bits.

[23:40:14] <Julius_> yawkat, you can easily show that the attacker who knows m and f(m) has more information (i.e. an advantage) over the attacker who does not know f(m) for any m
[23:40:33] <Julius_> + "for one m" in the first case
[23:41:13] <yawkat> ok, but thats not relevant to the theorem

[23:44:46] <yawkat> yes. now see where our statements differ
[23:45:02] <Julius_> Yours is wrong :)
[23:46:15] *** Parts: jc_denton[m] (~raiichika@2001:470:69fc:105::ce06) ()
[23:46:30] <Julius_> I didn't mean to distract you guys from your discussion. Go on
[23:48:40] <LTCD> Fair enough, just a way of saying it is not necessarily differentiating between m0 and m1, but semantic security also applies to functions.
[23:50:30] <yawkat> yes, iirc it is equivalent to indistinguishability notions.
[23:52:29] <yawkat> actually i guess not, because m is uniformly random.
[23:52:34] <yawkat> but theyre "similar" notions.
[23:55:22] <LTCD> You could have just said: I have some good news, and some bad news. The bad news is you are wrong, because f can be any function, however the good news is that yes perhaps f is a function to determine the 2nd bit of the input.
[23:55:40] <yawkat> :) 
[23:56:12] <yawkat> Making the statement general is important for robust security. 
[23:56:32] <LTCD> Well, we got there in the end.
[23:59:57] <synaps3> Julius_, crypto is not cryptocurrencies
