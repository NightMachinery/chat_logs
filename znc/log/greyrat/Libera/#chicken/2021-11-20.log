[00:19:53] <wasamasa> advent of code feels slightly less pointless than project euler to me
[00:20:05] <wasamasa> 90% of the challenges are designed to be trivially solved with perl
[00:20:24] <wasamasa> the remaining 10% lend themselves to actually thinking about algorithms and optimization
[00:29:09] <Zipheir> I wish there were a way to get the Advent of Code puzzle data without writing 25 parsers.  It's definitely the most boring part of those puzzles, IMHO.
[00:29:39] <wasamasa> it's cool to spend not too much time on, but in terms of learning, yeah no
[00:29:58] <wasamasa> you'd learn way more using scheme for something otherwise trivial in python :P
[00:30:33] <Zipheir> Yes, it seems to miss the point to just solve those things with Perl/Python tricks.
[00:31:20] <Zipheir> e.g. use miniKanren with no library support. >:)
[00:37:23] <wasamasa> yeah, could be interesting to solve them in something prolog-like

[05:40:14] <mdhughes> A friend of mine did them in prolog one year, and it was unbelievably awful. Many couldn't be solved, at least with the impl she used.
[05:40:47] <mdhughes> My Scheme runs on AoC have been pretty easy, once I made a couple text loading/parsing tools I needed anyway.
[06:17:36] <jcowan> I swore to myself I wouldn't write any more recursive descent parsers (too boring), but then I got annoyed at an interview when I had a whiteboard exercise to write a function to check a string for balanced ()s.
[06:19:15] <jcowan> So I got the bit between my teeth and wrote an LL(1) grammar and an RDP to match.  It worked, but the interviewer was maybe 1/3 my age and had never heard of LL(1) or RDP.  I didn't get that job.
[06:21:03] <mdhughes> "Sir, this is a Wendy's."
[06:22:28] <mdhughes> Last time I interviewed in person was at a Java shop, and the interviewer panicked when I wrote some Scheme, so I switched to Python, which also he didn't know, so I wrote a bit of reflection-based code in Java to solve the problem. Also didn't get that, but the team did buy me lunch.
[06:30:17] <Zipheir> jcowan: Wow.
[06:30:19] <jcowan> Nah, this was plain Python, which had been asked for.

[12:00:56] <littleme[m]> why does repl can't use ffi?
[12:33:00] <s-liao> littleme[m] you have to compile those sources with FFI to one so file. Then export functions for your usage in REPL.

[15:16:33] <amazigh> mario-goulart: yes and no, you mean there is 4 entries?
[15:16:49] <mario-goulart> Yeah
[15:17:20] <amazigh> maybe i shoud fix that.
[15:17:39] <mario-goulart> I feel like CHICKEN is missing in many items.
[15:17:55] <amazigh> yes, please let me know if the flags are wrong.
[15:19:58] <mario-goulart> E.g., OpenBSD, Can be embedded in another program, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Windows, R5RS
[15:21:39] <mario-goulart> CHICKEN can also in a way create binary executables.  Strictly speaking is not really CHICKEN, but just compiling to C is not particularly useful.
[15:22:13] <mario-goulart> Also, I think CHICKEN also works on Android and iOS (but I haven't tested that myself).

[15:22:53] <mario-goulart> It also should probably work on aarch64.  It centainly works on x86.
[15:23:10] <mario-goulart> ... and amd64.
[15:24:05] <mario-goulart> Not exactly sure what "Object-oriented programming" means, but CHICKEN also has a couple of eggs on that too.
[15:25:10] <mario-goulart> "Deployment tools" is also not clear to me.
[15:25:50] <mario-goulart> Also very cool that you've used spock for that!
[15:26:14] <amazigh> things like ansible, puppet, or the ability to sftp easily and run remote shell commands (that is what fabric does)
[15:27:16] <amazigh> yes I will fix those flags you mentioned. 
[15:27:26] <mario-goulart> I see.  I don't know anything like that for CHICKEN.  That would be great to have.
[15:27:41] <amazigh> It is difficult to draw the line, but in the case of chicken you can build binary executables.
[15:27:56] <mario-goulart> Just yesterday I made a presentation on Ansible at work ("Ansible considered incomprehensible").
[15:28:02] <amazigh> +1
[15:28:20] <amazigh> I prefer python's fabric, it is a wrapper around ssh and sftp
[15:28:31] <amazigh> with the ability to  run things in parallel
[15:29:41] <mario-goulart> Cool.  Actually at work e use a CI thing called Zuul and it happens to use Ansible as API for programming CI jobs.  I think "misuse" of Ansible makes even more evident how Ansible sucks for some stuff.

[15:34:05] <amazigh> and people keep pushing those, and they do not understand why they project fail or are very painful.
[15:34:17] <mario-goulart> Yeah, everything sucks.
[15:38:56] <amazigh> They are alternatives to ansible, and k8s, but those are not pushed mainstream and remain secret sauce, I guess. Such as Scheme :)
[15:43:10] <s-liao> What is the sauce?
[15:45:30] <amazigh> secret tool
[15:46:13] <amazigh> I mean secret tool, but also secret pratice: before using a tool, try to figure if it solve your *own* problems. 
[15:46:47] <amazigh> k8s and docker solve, in large part, iaas providers problems.
[15:47:19] <amazigh> and they make it more difficult to deploy an app. imo.
[15:47:24] <amazigh> and ime.
[15:49:41] <s-liao> I just use docker, Not like your guys too much develop activities are needed.
[15:51:02] <s-liao> By the way, what is main.js file for in the project of https://scheme.rs/comparator/?
[15:53:12] <amazigh> main.js is compiled from main.scm which is based on code.scm
[15:53:15] <amazigh> give me one sec

[15:57:50] <amazigh> actually, create-app below will start it, but most of the interesting stuff is in the procedure `view`, and the procedure called inside `view`
[15:59:49] <s-liao> That is cool. What is the different chicken generator js files and chicken-spock generator js files?
[16:00:39] <s-liao> littleme[m] That is Okay.
[16:01:10] <mario-goulart> CHICKEN doesn't generate javascript.  CHICKEN only generates C code.  Spock is an egg, which implements a Scheme->javascript compiler.

[16:03:18] <s-liao> Okay. I thought that Gamit can do that. Chicken can do it as well.
[16:03:40] <amazigh> Gambit does have a javascript target, indeed.
[16:04:00] <amazigh> but unlike Gambit, Spock can't re-use chicken's eggs / libraries.
[16:04:30] <amazigh> Gambit is in large part in my opinion still a moving target.
[16:04:31] <s-liao> Yes, it is not an option to generate  js files from scheme files  in chicken.
[16:04:39] <amazigh> yes
[16:05:42] <s-liao> What do you mean Spock can't re-use chicken's eggs / libraries?
[16:06:41] <mario-goulart> Spock is a different Scheme implementation.  It happens to be implemented in CHICKEN and shipped as an egg, but it is not CHICKEN.  CHICKEN eggs are CHICKEN-specific.
[16:13:29] <s-liao> You mean that plug into the chicken system. A different  scheme implementation is base on chicken base . it is an egg, specially for chicken.
[16:13:52] <s-liao> It is not an egg specially for chicken.
[16:15:23] <s-liao> That is my fault. I have not learned that clearly yet.
[16:18:48] <s-liao> I have not played around spock yet. your guys were talking about web. I thought that is spiffy egg.
[16:19:09] <s-liao> :')
[16:20:13] <amazigh> no worries.
[16:25:39] <s-liao> Okay. The project create front-end in scheme. The server is http.server python module.
[16:30:01] <s-liao> Look like quite similar to what you did in this project https://git.sr.ht/~amirouche/forward.scm
[16:31:27] <s-liao> mario-goulart thanks
[16:32:16] <mario-goulart> yw
[16:33:42] <amazigh> s-liao: yes.
[16:36:00] <amazigh> both code base (forward.scm and the comparator) are missing xhr support
[16:36:33] <amazigh> if one use preactjs hooks, you can get a way without call/cc but I prefer to use call/cc than hooks
[16:37:14] <amazigh> make-controll must include some prompt-like machinery to be able to pause the PROC during xhr
[16:37:39] <amazigh> I did it already in another project.
[16:38:20] <amazigh> or you can find your way with native javascript without preact at all...
[16:39:42] <amazigh> I will go afk for nap. see you later.
