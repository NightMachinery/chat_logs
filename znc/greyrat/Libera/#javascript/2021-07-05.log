[03:39:43] <wroathe> Really making us work to help you with this, huh?
[03:40:01] <theskillwithin> so this is called magic numbers,   a number used in your code which you haven't labeled so no one knows what it  means who reads the code
[03:40:13] <theskillwithin> also why would u type out 1.6666666667  instead of just 1.7 lol
[03:40:38] <theskillwithin> we might never know the answer
[03:41:13] <theskillwithin> do a git blame, see who wrote the code =]
[03:44:24] <Crash1hd> wroathe, its x cause I have no idea what it is?
[03:45:00] <Crash1hd> theskillwithin, fair enough.  I figured someone might have an idea lol
[03:45:19] <wroathe> Crash1hd: Well, from what I can tell maxValue is always 15, and maxValue divided by 1.6 repeating is 8.9 repeating
[03:45:22] <Crash1hd> There should be some sort of logical reasoning for it :)
[03:45:42] <Crash1hd> wroathe, in this example maxValue is always 15 in the real one maxValue can change
[03:45:42] <wroathe> Crash1hd: And you're only using it in one place that I can see, on line 172
[03:45:51] <Crash1hd> yes
[03:45:58] <wroathe> Crash1hd: Well, let's just consider it for that one maxValue for now
[03:46:09] <wroathe> Crash1hd: And currentValue seems like it's a number between 0 and maxValue
[03:46:26] <wroathe> Crash1hd: So in this case that condition will only ever be true when the currentValue is 9 or above
[03:46:38] <Crash1hd> yes
[03:46:52] <Crash1hd> thus why it ends up being 1.6...
[03:47:15] <wroathe> Huh? That's not something that follows from this line of reasoning
[03:47:24] <Crash1hd> if I change maxValue to 20 and currentValue  the number 9 changes but the equation is always 1.66666667
[03:47:24] <wroathe> 1.6 is just an arbitrary magic number that's been chosen for all we know
[03:47:42] <Crash1hd> but the question is why is it 1.6
[03:47:53] <wroathe> Crash1hd: That's what I was trying to help you reason towards
[03:48:02] <Crash1hd> wroathe, :)
[03:48:08] <wroathe> Crash1hd: It's input to that conditional down below where you try to determine what largeArc is supposed to be
[03:48:18] <wroathe> Crash1hd: And it looks like largeArc can only ever be a 0 or a 1
[03:48:32] <Crash1hd> yes
[03:48:32] <wroathe> Crash1hd: So you'll need to find out what this script uses largeArc for
[03:48:35] <theskillwithin> hehe when i play with the sliders, after a bit the page freezes up
[03:48:47] <Crash1hd> theskillwithin, sadly yes.

[03:52:26] <Crash1hd> yes

[03:52:36] <wroathe> Crash1hd: M x y A r1 r2 0 largeArc ...
[03:52:58] <Crash1hd> to create an arc that I can either create an arc from the left or the right respectively
[03:53:08] <Crash1hd> That is the purpose of the toggle
[03:53:16] <Crash1hd> reverese the gauge
[03:53:35] <Crash1hd> Gauge Sweep allows you to change the angle of the arc
[03:53:47] <Crash1hd> from either 180 or 300 or something custom
[03:54:28] <Crash1hd> then there is the maxValue and interval (which are what cause it to lockup on occasion) to change the max number of gauge numbers based on maxValue requirements being passed in
[03:54:42] <wroathe> Donitz: That was helpful
[03:54:48] <Crash1hd> the red gauge is the actual gauge (the rest are static)
[03:54:54] <Donitz> it's just the truth
[03:54:59] <Donitz> I used to guess all the time, and troublesnipe things
[03:55:09] <Donitz> understand the basic issue, don't just guess numbers
[03:55:10] <wroathe> Donitz: Words of wisdom
[03:55:38] <wroathe> Crash1hd: So I'm logging these output paths here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ivy-ybivz5?file=src%2Fapp%2Fgauge.component.ts
[03:56:11] <Donitz> so the first thing I would recommend
[03:56:16] <Donitz> find an online interactive SVG command editor
[03:56:30] <Crash1hd> Donitz, like this https://mavo.io/demos/svgpath/
[03:56:39] <Donitz> your script froze my browser window
[03:56:41] <Crash1hd> thats how I learned about the large arc
[03:56:43] <Donitz> you seem to have some kind of loop thingy
[03:56:47] <Crash1hd> Donitz, :( sorry.
[03:57:06] <Crash1hd> As indicated it only freezes when you change the gauge interval
[03:57:11] <Crash1hd> not sure why
[03:57:45] <Crash1hd> I rewrote most of this based on this http://xahlee.info/js/svg_circle_arc.html and this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44876955/convert-svg-semi-circle-arc-to-full-circle-arc-using-path
[03:58:25] <Crash1hd> I changed the 3 arcs in the later to the single arc in the svg_circle_arc. (but the math in the svg_circle_arc is way beyond my knowledge so i was not able to use the matrix part
[03:58:31] <Crash1hd> which is why I think its not working 100%
[03:59:14] <Crash1hd> Stuff like Δ = Δ % (2*π); hurts my brain, I understand that its delta = delta modulus (2 time pi) but still.
[04:00:33] <wroathe> Crash1hd: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathDataEllipticalArcCommands
[04:00:35] <wroathe> Crash1hd: This covers it
[04:00:35] <Crash1hd> wroathe, if you look at the examples I just shared you will see similarities to my code at the very end of the first example there setAttribute d has fA and fS (those are the large arc and sweep) whats interesting about his code is that the largeArc or fA is just modulus > PI bit flip

[04:00:54] <Crash1hd> yes 100%
[04:01:19] <wroathe> Crash1hd: What I would do is copy the code samples from this section, and draw arcs in isolation to see what the difference is between the four kinds they document in this section
[04:01:30] <wroathe> Crash1hd: So you can see visually what impact the "large-arc-flag" has
[04:01:54] <wroathe> Crash1hd: And that will help you unwind why this magic number is the way it is (or if it being there is just nonsense, which is what I suspect)
[04:02:27] <Crash1hd> I have done that.  what I am confused about though is why mine has to be this large if else when theres is just a simple bit flip.
[04:02:39] <Crash1hd> and why x has to be maxValue / 1.66667 etc
[04:02:49] <Crash1hd> the 1.6 is very arbitrary
[04:03:06] <theskillwithin> its 5 / 3  i guess, but who types out 1.6666667
[04:03:24] <theskillwithin> it makes me feel like someone copy and pasted it from a calculation
[04:03:30] <wroathe> Crash1hd: If you've done that, then the answer should be relatively obvious. If you're just copying this code from something else, be very wary that it might not be correct

[04:05:23] <wroathe> Crash1hd: And by understanding this, you should be able to piece together why you would want or not want the large-arc-flag to be 1
[04:05:34] <wroathe> Crash1hd: And that should tell you whether or not this mystery computation is a necessity
[04:06:32] <Crash1hd> wroathe, I understand why I want it or dont, i just dont understand why my code requires the 1.6 and the example here http://xahlee.info/js/svg_circle_arc.html does not.
[04:06:34] <wroathe> Crash1hd: Keep in mind that with this Angular example you've linked both the sweep flag and the large arc flag are always 0 while dragging the gauge negative value slider back and forth
[04:07:35] <wroathe> Crash1hd: It sounds like you're relying too much on other people's code and reverse engineering, instead of just thinking through how you would draw this gauge shape in terms of the primitives
[04:07:37] <Crash1hd> wroathe, it is? thats strange
[04:07:48] <Crash1hd> wroathe, 100%
[04:08:12] <wroathe> Crash1hd: That's why I'm saying you should draw this gauge in isolation using the documentation in that section I linked. I'm guessing you'll arrive at a solution that has no need for this 1.6 repeating

[04:08:28] <wroathe> Crash1hd: And if you do eventually find a need for it, then you'll have your answer as to why it's there.
[04:08:47] <Crash1hd> wroathe, oh yes it would always be 1 in the 180 example but if you click on the gauge sweep checkbox then it will change between 0 and 1
[04:09:30] <Crash1hd> at least the middle path does.
[04:10:32] *** Joins: Codaraxis_ (~Codaraxis@ip68-5-90-227.oc.oc.cox.net)
[04:11:01] <Crash1hd> wroathe, I mean it works, just was trying to figure out why. (more so also trying to understand the Δ in the example here http://xahlee.info/js/svg_circle_arc.html
[04:11:36] <wroathe> Crash1hd: I just gave you the blueprint to understand why
[04:11:59] <wroathe> Crash1hd: By copying people's code you'll always find yourself in this situation. You'd have saved time by just building this from the ground up.
[04:13:50] <Crash1hd> Very true :) and the help is greatly appreciated.
[04:13:53] <wroathe> Crash1hd: If you go below that threshold I mentioned with Guage Sweep unchecked, you can see that the background and gradients arcs have large-arc-flag set to 1
[04:14:01] <wroathe> Crash1hd: And that the value arc has it set to 0
[04:14:16] *** Quits: Codaraxis__ (~Codaraxis@193.32.126.157) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[04:15:48] <wroathe> Crash1hd: So you just have to answer why you'd want that to be 0 when the flag goes below that computed threshold value (8.9 repeating, for this example)
[04:15:58] <wroathe> Crash1hd: I suspect you don't, and that it's pointless.
[04:17:35] <wroathe> Crash1hd: Oh, if you delete that branch you can immediately see what effect is has
[04:17:38] <wroathe> it has
[04:19:58] <Crash1hd> yeah. (it moves the arc outside the path I want.)
[04:22:52] <Crash1hd> I would just use the code in this example http://xahlee.info/js/svg_circle_arc.html but I need to be able to reverse the direction (which is how I ended up with this Frankenstein of a code.

[18:51:17] <entuland> that's going to be way more complex
[18:51:21] <de-facto> i know
[18:51:34] <entuland> you need to check the source of all the JS that is running on your page
[18:51:38] <de-facto> i assume there is some list in the js code that contains the info to create those urls
[18:51:45] <de-facto> exactly
[18:51:48] <entuland> that code may be obfuscated
[18:52:01] <entuland> so it may not be easy to simply search for bits of it
[18:52:12] <entuland> even the "iframe" word could be split / obfuscated
[18:52:28] <de-facto> yes i search for the individual part of those iframe strings
[18:52:43] <entuland> let alone how they build the URL they're going to put in such an IFRAME src property
[18:53:08] <de-facto> so for example the url is the same except for one part, here it would be "utuM7"
[18:53:11] *** Joins: wyclif (~wyclif@user/wyclif)
[18:53:25] <de-facto> hence i want to search that string in every bit my browser loads from that server
[18:54:21] <entuland> there may be other ways to "detect" the fact that some code altered the markup and trace back to it
[18:55:11] <entuland> but considering that such markup could be altered with appendChild(), indirectly setting innerHTML or even with document.write(), this looks quite a hunt
[18:55:11] *** Joins: Akimb (~Akimb@78-58-31-17.static.zebra.lt)
[18:55:30] <de-facto> on the page there is a dropdown to select different frames
[18:55:46] <entuland> is this page somewhere live we can see and which you can share?
[18:56:05] <de-facto> yes
[18:56:07] <de-facto> https://www.intensivregister.de/#/aktuelle-lage/zeitreihen
[18:56:27] <de-facto> i want to get the frames for federal states from the main page load
[18:57:10] <entuland> try stopping the JS execution in the console
[18:57:15] <entuland> then change the value of the dropdown
[18:57:20] <entuland> and see what JS gets executed
[18:58:47] <de-facto> i made the list manually, but i want to find out the source (origin) of the data that creates those frame urls so i can do it automatically, they change from time to time (i think last time in feb)
[18:59:13] <entuland> well, your entry point is that select there
[18:59:27] <entuland> you can see what code gets executed when the selection changes
[18:59:56] <de-facto> hmm how could i see that?
[19:00:03] <de-facto> i am on chrome right now
[19:00:11] <de-facto> devtools
[19:00:37] <entuland> open the dev tools, switch over to sources, pause the execution, change the selection and see what code gets triggered
[19:00:54] <entuland> it's a bit of a mess because it will halt when you start opening the dropdown
[19:01:41] <entuland> technically that's not a "true" select element, it's a mess of divs "pretending" to be a select element
[19:01:54] <de-facto> hmm but pause script exec makes the whole page inaccessible
[19:02:00] <entuland> I know
[19:02:01] <de-facto> i cant use the select then
[19:02:12] <entuland> that's because it's not really a select, as I explained
[19:02:49] <entuland> but you can pause _after_ you have opened the dropdown
[19:02:59] <entuland> so that it will trigger at your click of a different option
[19:03:04] <entuland> and you can step through the code from there

[19:04:34] <entuland> I'll explain that again: open the dropdown, you should see a list of values to pick from in your page, pause the execution, there shouldn't be any code running at this point, click on one of the items and the execution would _start_ and immediately stop

[19:13:49] <de-facto> as i said, interaction with the page is blocked on debugger in my chrome
[19:14:00] <de-facto> i dont know how to click on anything as long as debugger is on
[19:14:07] <entuland> you don't have to pause execution if you set a breakpoint
[19:14:20] <entuland> that's the point of setting the breakpoint, avoiding to stop the interactivity
[19:14:30] <entuland> you set a breakpoint by just clicking on the line number of a specific line
[19:14:37] <entuland> that blue line in my image is a breakpoint
[19:14:56] <de-facto> but it runs into paused on breakpoint
[19:15:02] <de-facto> blocks page immediately, can interact
[19:15:16] <entuland> re-run until you're not hitting that breakpoint anymore
[19:15:25] <entuland> I mean, it worked for me, should work for you if you do the steps correctly
[19:16:01] <entuland> remove the breakpoint, resume execution, open the dropdown, add the breakpoint, click on a different item of the dropdown, and you should get the same output I got in the screenshot above

[19:52:20] <de-facto> i think i created that script last winter or such, had to manually update the urls several times, and now wanted to automate that but did not search through their pages

[21:12:38] <wroathe> shan: You don't need to store either of those on the window object. Instead, you can just keep them in the closure.
[21:13:03] <GreenJello> shan, the 'includes' part of the condition doesn't do anything

[21:14:22] <shan> wroathe: damn closures are cool
[21:14:35] <wroathe> They are pretty snazzy.
[21:14:38] <GreenJello> also, if you're going to wait for the load event, better to use addEventListener instead of onload
[21:14:58] <GreenJello> otherwise you might have conflicts with other scripts
[21:15:11] <systemfault> DOMContentLoaded ftw.
[21:15:17] <wroathe> And you don't need to wait for the load event anyway. DOMContentLoaded might be more appropriate
[21:15:20] <wroathe> Yeah, that one.
[21:15:21] <GreenJello> in this case you don't need to wait for anything
[21:15:27] <GreenJello> you could just call init()
[21:15:35] <GreenJello> or make it an IIFE
[21:15:56] <shan> right, i usually use window.onload in my projects idk how i let it slip into a library
[21:15:57] <wroathe> That too
[21:16:13] <wroathe> Yeah, you don't need to wait for anything here
[21:16:14] <entuland> you could as well reference your script in a deferred <script> tag and call init() right away probably
[21:16:29] <shan> what's the difference between DOMContentLoaded and load events?
[21:16:52] <wroathe> shan: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/DOMContentLoaded_event
[21:16:59] <shan> thanks
[21:17:35] *** Quits: comatory_ (~ondrejsyn@93.99.127.7) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[21:17:36] <systemfault> TL;DR: the "load" event waits for things like images to load... it occurs way too late, DOMContentLoaded is better 99.9% of the time.
[21:18:00] <wroathe> shan: But as GreenJello pointed out, you don't need either here.
[21:18:07] <shan> right
[21:18:28] <shan> changed it to an IIFE
[21:18:44] <wroathe> shan: Also, keydown fires while the key is pressed, and keyup fires after it's been released
[21:18:51] <wroathe> shan: My guess would be that you want the latter
[21:18:56] <shan> keyup is better, yeah

[21:59:12] <earendel> if you don't plan to puiblsh it as a separate package.. or for the time of development..it's probably less messy to just require it as a file in the same project.
[21:59:56] <earendel> i don't know what happens when publishing a package with locally linked libs at all. it hopefully just fails.

[22:00:58] <Lauxley> got read of the fork and renamed the symlink, still can't resolve
[22:01:07] <qswz> rid*
[22:01:33] <Lauxley> indeed sorry I'm getting angry it hinders my capacity to write english
[22:01:33] <qswz> you can also do npm i ../relative/path
[22:01:48] <Lauxley> that's the first thing I tried 2 hours ago
[22:01:51] <qswz> works with local packages, try it
[22:01:55] <qswz> ah ok
[22:02:10] <qswz> npm version?
[22:02:20] <Lauxley> there is probably another issue maybe in the package.json of the lib or something and the error is just bs
[22:02:32] <Lauxley> 6.14.4
[22:02:44] <earendel> you shouldn't mess with forks or symlinks.
[22:02:45] <qswz> recent enough, using 7.x here
[22:03:04] <wroathe> Lauxley: Well, if you're not going to share the file and the errors with us it makes helping you debug far more difficult

[22:03:46] <wroathe> Lauxley: If the npm link works without problem, and you can verify that foo is a symlink, and that the package's contents are there, then the next thing to do is to look at how you're importing foo in the file that needs it, and to verify that foo's package.json is correct
[22:04:34] <Lauxley> the import works when I use the official package install, I'm not expecting to change it
[22:04:55] <qswz> use npm unlink to remove a npm link
[22:05:07] <qswz> (you can check the state of your actual links using npm outdated)
[22:05:14] <qswz> in a project
[22:05:31] <wroathe> Then something in your package.json might be wrong. The point is to follow a process of elimination. For example, if the package.json's "main" field doesn't point to a valid file in the newly linked project that'll likely give you the error you're seeing.

[22:06:35] <wroathe> Lauxley: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#main
[22:06:42] <earendel> would npm link touch a package.json at all? i think no?
[22:07:11] <qswz> when I've trouble with npm, I often endup deleting node_modules, package-lock.json and npm i again
[22:07:39] *** Joins: comatory_ (~ondrejsyn@93.99.127.7)
[22:07:41] <Lauxley> yep I tried that too qswz just in case
[22:07:52] <qswz> you could try clearing your npm cache as well
[22:08:00] <Lauxley> ok that I didn't
[22:08:11] <earendel> i think it just runs npm install on the requested package and creates a sym link in the target package.
[22:08:14] <qswz> needs --force or something I think
[22:08:33] <Lauxley> btw I can't unlink the package it throws an error because the file doesn't actually exists anymore and -f does not help
[22:08:49] <earendel> because u deleted the symlink manually.
[22:08:59] <earendel> which you shouldn't have done.
[22:09:14] <qswz> try removing that line in package.json, save and npm i
[22:09:31] <earendel> just do npm install --save package.
[22:09:44] <qswz> &or the hard way rm-rf
[22:09:44] <wroathe> :/
[22:09:47] <earendel> you don't want links for libs you dont work on.
[22:10:31] <Lauxley> ok so let me start from a clean state, I'll remove node_modules, package-lock and the line in package.json, anything else I need to do?
[22:10:57] <earendel> which line in package.json?
[22:11:01] <qswz> upgrade npm as you are
[22:11:03] <qswz> :)
[22:11:04] <Lauxley> now npm outdated shows me everything but the package in question as MISSING so I should be good?

[22:12:07] <qswz> yea, re-add it using npm i that-pkg
[22:12:09] <earendel> remove it.
[22:12:29] <earendel> + --save
[22:12:39] <earendel> or it wont be added.
[22:12:58] <earendel> then run npm install.
[22:13:42] <qswz> preferences: firstName vs firstname?
[22:14:01] <qswz> I'd write username for example
[22:14:03] <Rockwood> case
[22:14:05] <earendel> cC
[22:14:15] <qswz> but I'd opt for firstName I think
[22:14:18] <Lauxley> ok so btw when I do npm link from the forked package directory it needs sudo right because the link is in /usr/lib/node_modules but it shouldn't matter as it only needs read access from then right?
[22:14:39] <qswz> you should npm link from the package you work on
[22:14:46] <qswz> not from the remote one
[22:14:57] <Lauxley> the docs says both?
[22:15:07] <qswz> I never needed to do both
[22:15:28] <Rockwood> you should remember about usergroup to
[22:16:07] <qswz> if I work on ~/dev/cool-app and want to use a fork of lodash, in ~/dev/cool-app I do just npm link ../lodash (assuming I've cloned lodash just nearby)
[22:16:16] <Lauxley> ok so the link exists in /usr/lib/node_modules so I should just run npm run start?
[22:16:32] <qswz> npm start
[22:16:34] <wroathe> qswz: That usage is not documented in npm link, and I've never seen someone use it that way

[22:16:57] <qswz> it has always worked for me that way, sorry then
[22:17:11] <wroathe> qswz: The standard way to use it is to go to the package you want to link against, and run "npm link", and then go to the package you're linking it into, and run "npm link foo"
[22:17:24] <wroathe> where foo is that original package you linked in the first step
