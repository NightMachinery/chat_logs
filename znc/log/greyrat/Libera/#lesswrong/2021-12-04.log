[02:56:03] <Gurkenglas> hrrrrm he says that since the student architecture contains the teacher architecture there can't be realizability error. but couldn't it be that which parts of function space are accessible depends on initialization?
[02:56:20] <ggreer> I wonder if they'll build a normal AWD system with open differentials and two motors driving each diff or if they'll have one motor hooked up to each wheel
[02:57:02] <ggreer> if I wanted to get economies of scale, I'd probably build a one motor module that hooks up to two wheels and a two motor module that does the same, then mix and match them throughout the product line
[02:57:31] <Gurkenglas> as in the lottery ticket hypothesis
[02:57:38] <ggreer> you could carbon wrap some of the rotors for better performance, but otherwise keep everything the same
[02:58:54] <ggreer> that'd give you rear wheel drive with 1 motor, an AWD version with two motors (one in front, one in back), a performance version with 3 motors (1 in front, 2 in back) and a mega torque 4 motor version for the truck 
[02:59:23] <ggreer> but otherwise the motor units could be used in the model 3, Y, S, X, and cybertruck
[03:00:33] <gwern> ggreer: compression isn't about getting a good ratio, but about getting it really really really cheaply
[03:00:48] <ggreer> depends on how often you compress versus decompress
[03:01:11] <gwern> the decompress will also be too expensive if you use a NN

[03:01:54] <gwern> but no one will ever want to run a GPT-2 for either compression or decompression
[03:02:07] <kuudes> 2 dosed coverage in SA is 24,7% and onedoses+twodosed 29,4%
[03:02:36] <kuudes> so vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization would seem to have a factor of maybe 1/3, for delta it was for 2 dose maybe 1/5 - 1/10
[03:02:52] <ggreer> damnit. induction motors are also known as "tesla motors" because they were invented by nikola tesla
[03:02:54] <kuudes> so reduction by factor of 2-3, which could be in line with infectivity/reproduction number
[03:02:57] <ggreer> kinda makes googling for this stuff tricky
[03:03:00] <kuudes> booster is possibly very useful
[03:04:08] <ggreer> I know the model 3 uses a permanent magnet motor in the rear and an induction in the front. IIRC they used induction because it's less likely to run into materials shortages (no rare earth magnets)
[03:04:32] <ggreer> but I think the new model s/x has more standardized & modular motor units

One example is triangular e-commerce fraud, which (like much fraud) is so brilliant that if it weren’t absurdly evil you’d almost have to admire the folks who thought it up. The basic mechanic is: open an account on a legitimate e-commerce platform. You operate like a
[06:42:22] <feepbot> real business, selling valuable things to people for money. You acquire customers by running ads or sending email or competing on SEO or pricing aggressively or what have you.

[06:42:22] <feepbot> the thing your customer bought with delivery to your customer. You pay with a stolen credit card. This is really hard for the e-commerce platform to detect, because you look an awful lot like a legitimate business!

[07:09:37] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah I agree
[07:12:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> "A second line of evidence comes from the loss of beneficial technologies in small, isolated populations. For instance, the Tasmanian tool kit gradually lost complexity after isolation from mainland Australia at the end of the Holocene (26). Other Pacific island groups have apparently lost useful technologies, such as canoes, pottery, and the bow and arrow (27). The best documented example comes from the isolated Polar Inuit
[07:12:22] <Obormot\Arcturus>  of northwest Greenland."
[07:12:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Explorers Elisha Kane and Isaac Hayes wintered with the Polar Inuit in 1853 and 1861, respectively, and reported that the Polar Inuit lacked kayaks, leisters, and bows and arrows and that their snow houses did not have the long heat-saving entryways that were seen among other Inuit populations. They could not hunt caribou, could only hunt seals during part of the year, and were unable to harvest arctic char efficiently,
[07:12:37] <Obormot\Arcturus>  although char were plentiful in local streams (28)."
[07:12:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Apparently the population was struck by an epidemic in the 1820s that carried away the older, knowledgeable members of the group, and according to custom, their possessions had to be buried with them (29). The Polar Inuit lived without these tools until about 1862, when they were visited by a group of Inuit who migrated to Greenland from Baffin Island (28, 29). There is every reason to believe that these tools would have been
[07:12:45] <Obormot\Arcturus>  useful between 1820 and 1862. The Polar Inuit population declined during this period, and the tools were immediately adopted once they were reintroduced. After their introduction, population size increased."
[07:13:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> "After their introduction, population size increased. It is also telling that the kayaks used by the Polar Inuit around the turn of the century closely resemble the large, beamy kayaks used by Baffin Island Inuit and not the small sleek kayaks of the West Greenland Inuit. Over the next half century the Polar Inuit kayak design converged back to the West Greenland design (30). If this inference is correct it means that for 40
[07:13:05] <Obormot\Arcturus>  years (nearly two generations) the Polar Inuit could have benefitted from the lost knowledge. Moreover, they collectively remembered kayaks, leisters, and bows and arrows, but did not know how to make them and could not recreate that knowledge."

[11:40:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Reading this, it's really amazing to see the disparity between what these extremely prestigious and respected medical experts said we should be doing (and presumably they didn't think that they were making completely absurd, impossible suggestions), and what actually was done
[11:41:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> e.g.: "2. Make millions of diagnostic tests available. Not everyone needs to be tested, but everyone with symptoms does. The nation needs to gear up to perform millions of diagnostic tests in the next 2 weeks."
[11:44:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm no I was wrong about that, I guess we did get up to "millions" in that time frame
[11:44:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not many millions but still
[11:45:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, the editorial ends with: "Rather than stumble through a series of starts and stops and half-measures on both the health and the economic fronts, we should forge a strategy to defeat the coronavirus and open the way to economic revival. If we act immediately, we can make the anniversary of D-Day on June 6, 2020, the day America declares victory over the coronavirus."

[12:38:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> By "young" do you mean "underage"...?
[12:39:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> If so, then the answer to that question doesn't really have anything to do with "smart" or, for that matter, "men", or even "girls"...
[12:39:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Although of course that gender combo is most common, but that's just because of broader mate-preference patterns in humans, not anything specific to ephebophilia or whatever you're trying to "stop")

[12:40:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> In general
[12:40:50] <PapuaHardyNet> that's right, by "young" I mean "young enough that these men cannot reasonably hope to get into a relationship with these girls"

[13:08:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> I need to know wtf git is saying to me before I can decide that :p
[13:08:17] <rsaarelm> If you have anything interesting committed to a detached head you want to attach that somewhere or you'll lose it when you run gc next.

[13:08:29] <rsaarelm> Garbage collect.
[13:08:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> What if I never run that
[13:09:27] <rsaarelm> It can run it automatically sometimes.
[13:09:27] <saturn2> i think "detached from" might be telling you what HEAD was before you changed it
[13:09:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm, ok
[13:09:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Dramatic reveal:
[13:09:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a submodule

[13:11:12] <rsaarelm> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66112354/git-head-detached-from-vs-detached-at If I'm reading this right, it says "at" when you're still at the branch commit you dissociated from and "from" when you've done and committed work on top of it?
[13:11:12] <saturn2> so your submodule points to a detached commit?
[13:11:12] <Robomot> git HEAD detached *from* vs detached *at* - Stack Overflow (I am NOT new to git. I know what a detached HEAD is and that I can just checkout a new branch to move forward. But today I saw a detached from message instead of a detached at message. While trying...)
[13:11:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I guess!
[13:11:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or who even knows
[13:11:46] <saturn2> that should be fine as long as it's reachable from a branch or tag
[13:12:16] <rsaarelm> Yeah, submodule stuff is weird, I guess the submodule link can be pinning the commit then.
[13:12:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> But I don't actually think that's right
[13:12:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> The git config doesn't specify a commit, that I can see
[13:13:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess I just gotta re-figure-out how this *should* be set up
[13:13:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's always been my impression that git just generally interacts poorly with the concept of having different projects that have some dependency relationship
[13:14:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't really get why that should be, but it seems to be so...
[13:14:21] <rsaarelm> I try not to use submodules ever unless I have to, they're a pain in the ass.
[13:14:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah but like - setting practical advice or w/e aside for the moment - why is it like this? Doesn't that, like, not make any sense?
[13:15:16] <rsaarelm> Hm, I got a handwavy idea what's going on.
[13:15:58] <rsaarelm> Assume the submodule configuration in the master repo doesn't go "commit deadbeef in branch master", it just says "commit deadbeef", no metadata on which branch you assume that's in.
[13:16:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't support for "a modular piece of code that's used in various places" something that should be like top-five feature list material for any kind of "tool to manage code shit"?
[13:16:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, broadly speaking, you know?
[13:16:45] <rsaarelm> So when the submodule gets pulled in, git just goes "git checkout deadbeef", and now you've got a detached head, even though deadbeef is a perfectly good master branch commit.
[13:16:54] <saturn2> git is a tool to manage, specifically, linux kernel development
[13:16:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Am I missing something here? It just seems so weird that this should be anything other than a totally smooth streamlined core functionality of git
[13:17:27] <saturn2> if you manage to make it work for anything else, good for you, but that's not what it's for
[13:17:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> :\
[13:18:29] <rsaarelm> I usually expect to use my operating system, container setup, nix script or whatever to manage the connections between loosely coupled program parts and use git for tight coupling where I actually pull in the source codes of the other thing into the same repo.
[13:18:51] <rsaarelm> +programming language specific package manager.
[13:18:55] <rsaarelm> For the handler list.
[13:19:03] <saturn2> i think the only reason it became popular was that it was the easiest to turn into a SaaS product in the web 2.0 days
[13:19:10] <rsaarelm> Like, I've got two Rust crates that are loosely coupled, I just point one at the github repo of the other.
[13:19:15] <rsaarelm> No git submodules.
[13:20:35] <rsaarelm> I'm pretty happy git got popular because it's nearly the only case I can think of where the weird fiddly thing I like using turned out to also be the defacto option everyone goes for.
[13:20:46] <rsaarelm> I guess Linux is sorta that too.

[15:02:02] <feep> stream parsing!
[15:02:27] <feep> ....
[15:02:39] <feep> how does stream parsing not have a wikipedia page
[15:03:52] <feep> probably
[15:04:07] <feep> probably because it's not the sort of thing that tends to come up in magazines??
[15:05:14] <feep> tl;dr just in case anyone doesn't know, the idea of a stream parser is that you interleave parsing code and construction code to build the data structure you want "in place"
[15:06:12] <feep> ie. instead of going through json objects on the way to your class, your class takes a range that can generate key-object pairs, and you switch on the key to decide which class field to initialize
[15:07:04] <feep> advantages: - no temporary json data structures, - can decode larger data than fits in memory, - usually faster
[15:08:20] <feep> we're doing fully autogenerated streamparsing at work <3
[15:09:21] <feep> it's also nice in that it's, at least in concept, zero-copy
[15:09:51] <feep> like sure you need to copy or intern strings, but if you're say reading an array of integers, you can do so directly from the network buffer no problem
[15:09:53] <Gurkenglas> i want to say that if you were doing haskell you would just get this by default but i think the pipes library goes to some effort to make it happen

[15:19:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Gurkenglas: Yeah? Why? What would parser combinators do for me
[15:21:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> !wp parser combinator
[15:21:23] <Robomot> Obormot\Arcturus: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator
[15:21:23] <Robomot> In computer programming, a parser combinator is a higher-order function that accepts several parsers as input and returns a new parser as its output. In this context, a parser is a function accepting strings as input and returning some structure as output, typically a parse tree or a set of indices representing locations in the string where parsing stopped successfully. 
[15:22:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> I won't say that this can't possibly be relevant to my interests, but I don't see the application to splitting a string by whitespace

[15:35:08] *** Quits: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:35:14] <Gurkenglas> it would look something like "upTo maxSplits (many (mfilter (not . whitespace) character) <* many (mfilter whitespace character))" - make the code for componentsSplitByWhitespaceWithMaxSplits made of parts that are responsible for respectively components, whitespace and maxsplits
[15:36:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're gonna have to expand on some of that
[15:36:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is mfilter
[15:37:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or "many", for that matter
[15:37:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> or ... <*
[15:38:41] <shawwwn> gwern: nice coherence https://twitter.com/NerdyRodent/status/1467103099383083009
[15:40:04] <Gurkenglas> many is like * in regexes
[15:40:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> Alright
[15:41:01] <Gurkenglas> we can instead consider the likes of "upTo maxSplits (regex '([\w]*)[\W]*')" :)
[15:42:08] <Gurkenglas> <* is for applying both parsers in order and then keeping only the data that the left parser produced.
[15:42:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, yes, as I said, I could rewrite it with regexps
[15:42:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> (\s and \S would be the relevant metacharacters, btw, not \w and \W)
[15:42:44] <Gurkenglas> huh, i must have missed that line. yes, do regexps ^^
[15:43:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that would be less efficient
[15:43:29] <Gurkenglas> it sounds to me like it will take this code from taking 0.01% of your bot's compute to taking 0.1% of it
[15:43:46] <nshepperd2> not sure mfilter is the thing to user here
[15:44:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> NSStringExtensions isn't some sort of bot-specific library!
[15:44:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> SA_NSStringExtensions, I mean
[15:44:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's general-purpose
[15:44:45] <Gurkenglas> there should be some library for compiling regexes into something more efficient, right?
[15:44:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not that I'm aware of
[15:45:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> What would that even look like
[15:45:16] <nshepperd2> isn't that what regex libraries are
[15:45:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, yes, obviously the implementation of the regexp will be as efficiently compiled as it can be
[15:45:44] <nshepperd2> like the whole dfa/nfa thing
[15:46:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm confident that Apple and the LLVM guys know what they're doing in this regard
[15:46:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's not really the concern
[15:46:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> A regexp-based implementation of this method would involve the creation of a bunch of additional objects
[15:46:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's no call for that, imo
[15:47:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Eh, I might do it anyway, we'll see
[15:47:56] <Gurkenglas> im out of my expertise here but couldnt that object be created once when your library is imported

[17:13:29] <rsaarelm> Instead of enabling Laziness with a handy format, a developer is expected to toil diligently with whatever was slapped together to get the game together.
[17:15:01] <rsaarelm> I think I read somewhere that the code base in Starcraft is horrible from a software engineering standpoint, it's just had hours and hours of programmer work spilled into it to patch over each and every bug found in QA so the actual end result still feels very solid and stable.

[17:16:50] <PapuaHardyNet> this program allows only grads, no masters. very interesting
[17:16:51] <rsaarelm> As long as you have cheap labor to throw at writing more and more boilerplate code, you don't need to bother with high skill floor force multiplier fancy programming techniques.

[17:19:06] <PapuaHardyNet> rsaarelm: well, let's be honest, if it works, it sells
[17:19:29] <PapuaHardyNet> if cheap labor is more profitable in the long run then that is what executives will go for
[17:19:44] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't see a reason for them to enshrine code quality as long as the money comes in
[17:23:46] <feep> I mean if money is free who cares, right? write in pseudocode and let your code monkeys boilerplate it for you
[17:24:16] <feep> counterargument: code monkeys are a lot harder to debug.
[17:25:04] <PapuaHardyNet> sure! this is why I use jax instead of pytorch, I can debug all my jax code because the library is small and I understand what the hell I write
[17:26:23] <PapuaHardyNet> i'm simply describing the view on the other end of the table
[17:26:33] <feep> sure, counterpoint tho: good use of fancy techniques makes code easier to understand
[17:27:05] <PapuaHardyNet> if you forced executives to spend four years majoring in computer science, they *will* have a better idea of the minimum resources they should invest to minimize dev time wasted
[17:27:36] <PapuaHardyNet> (which is why you must become an executive, feep. take the loss for the rest of us!)
[17:27:53] <feep> to spend four years coding* majoring in cs does nothing
[17:28:23] <feep> with review by an experienced programmer
[17:28:23] <PapuaHardyNet> breadth of experience matters, not depth
[17:28:44] <feep> exactly, and you don't get breadth in cs
[17:28:55] <PapuaHardyNet> most people's experience spending four years coding would be some javas****t framework

[22:31:47] <dTal> how about, if they gouge prices, we tax off their head

[22:47:06] <spxtr> or rather what is @[ stuff ]?
[22:47:16] <feep> also like, there's load-bearing whitespace, weird indentation...
[22:47:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> spxtr: Array literal, equivalent to [NSArray arrayWithObject:stuff]
[22:47:33] <spxtr> cool
[22:47:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: There's no load-bearing whitespace
[22:47:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> The whitespace is 100% aesthetic
[22:48:09] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: to be clear, this is just split(maxSplits)?
[22:48:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Yes but with proper whitespace handling (compare to previous link I posted earlier today)
[22:48:45] <feep> um, kay.
[22:48:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> The previous code (the one currently in the repo) did a weird thing with whitespace
[22:49:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which on reflection wasn't really "correct"
[22:49:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway what's so weird about this? It's just block-based enumeration of the matches of a regexp in a string
[22:50:12] <feep> like, I don't use a regex for split, but here's, just for comparison, neat's basic split function https://gist.github.com/FeepingCreature/824bb6b25d41cd045f8c71164b20747d

[22:52:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: I could write one more like that, but it'd be less efficient in various ways, plus splitting by *whitespace* (as opposed to "a specific string") requires more complexity
[22:52:57] <feep> mm

[22:53:37] <feep> still, this triggers my "is this really C" sense in the same way that rust does, and that, for instance, D does not
[22:53:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course it's not C
[22:53:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's Objective C :p
[22:54:05] <feep> sure but that's my point, Cness is an axis
[22:54:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Although!
[22:54:28] <feep> also jesus christ, the indentation is insane
[22:54:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> It might interest you to know that most of the "weird symbols" you were triggered by are actually from the C part
[22:54:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> And not the Objective part
[22:54:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> & is C
[22:54:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> ^ is C
[22:54:54] <feep> ^ is not C in that sense. 
[22:55:02] <feep> I assume you are not doing xor there :p
[22:55:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nope, not XOR
[22:55:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's blocks
[22:55:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> But blocks are a C language extension!
[22:55:49] <feep> idk, I just feel neat/D are going for a different visual language than obj c/rust are
[22:56:13] <feep> or perl really
[22:56:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> To me this is way more readable than your thing.
[22:56:44] <feep> to me, the opposite. (as is expected.)
[22:57:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> For one thing, I am a big fan of verbosity in identifier naming
[22:57:36] <feep> I like verbosity where needed.
[23:02:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: ... also, doesn't your code make a whole new string object at each step
[23:04:09] <feep> string is a value.
[23:04:31] <feep> well sorta, it's a reference into a backing object
[23:04:49] <feep> it's all slices, which are 3-pointer values
[23:05:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's ... what
[23:05:13] <feep> the sort of base-start-end thing
[23:05:28] <feep> neat has one more pointer there than D cause it needs to refcount
[23:05:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok whatever
[23:06:26] <feep> the only thing that allocates there is the append, and that doesn't allocate supermuch cause it follows a doubling strategy
[23:11:54] <Fusxfaranto> feep: how do you handle refcounting with slices?
[23:12:18] <feep> Fusxfaranto: each slice has a reference on the string object it points to
[23:12:44] <feep> hence the base pointer
[23:14:49] *** Quits: _inky (~inky_@37.252.67.70) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:14:52] <Fusxfaranto> makes sense
[23:17:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Anyway, if I were to implement that split function (unnecessary since Foundation already has it, but), it'd look like this: https://share.obormot.net/textfiles/vzvPauz7
[23:17:36] <feep> yeah I stand by that being unreadable to me
[23:17:47] <feep> ah well~
[23:17:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> (actually rangeOfSeparator doesn't even need an initial value)
[23:17:52] <feep> thanks for the demo
[23:17:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> (otherwise as posted)
[23:18:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Out of curiosity is that just because it's verbose or what
[23:18:15] <feep> it's hard to explain
[23:18:36] <feep> it ticks instead of tocking on every metric I consider important for readability from an aesthetic perspective
[23:19:00] <feep> it aims confidently somewhere outside my code reading strike zone
[23:19:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha
[23:19:46] <Fusxfaranto> i get lost reading objc whenever the [:] comes in
[23:20:19] <feep> same
[23:20:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Eh? It's just a message passing / method call syntax
[23:21:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> [targetObject methodNameWithFirstArgument:arg secondArgument:arg thirdArgument:arg];
[23:21:31] <feep> in my syntax as well as D's, [] is something that creates an array
[23:22:17] <Fusxfaranto> oh
[23:22:45] *** Quits: src (~src@user/src) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:22:58] <Fusxfaranto> is there a reason it's so different from existing c function call syntax?
[23:23:07] <Fusxfaranto> looks more like it belongs in a lisp or something
[23:24:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fusxfaranto: Yes indeed, and you've got it: because Objective C descends from Smalltalk
[23:24:24] <feep> that explains a lot of the visual language
[23:24:28] <feep> the weird indentation too
[23:24:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which ... is not a Lisp, but in some ways it's more like a Lisp than most modern things?
[23:24:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: I don't know what you mean by weird indentation tbh
[23:24:56] <feep> there's two big styles of multiline calls
[23:25:15] <feep> long long long long line(arg,
[23:25:21] <feep>                          arg2,
[23:25:37] <feep> and long long long long line(
[23:25:40] <feep>   arg,
[23:25:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, so this is the first one
[23:25:57] <feep> I think lisp tends to be in the first camp, yeah?
[23:26:00] <Fusxfaranto> the way arguments are lined up by colons looks very weird to me
[23:26:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Couldn't say about Lisp
[23:26:07] <feep> and Cs *tend* to the second
[23:26:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yeah it's just making the colons line up
[23:26:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> To easily read the arguments being passed
[23:26:28] <feep> plus or minus, it depends on the library really
[23:26:34] <Fusxfaranto> i'm sure you get used to it
