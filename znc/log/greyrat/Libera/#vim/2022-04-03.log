[02:18:18] <romainl> I recommend a "learn before doing" strategy, the kind that naturally reinforces reading capabilities for greater good

[02:22:17] <romainl> the ability to learn from one's mistakes is sadly not that common, though
[02:22:43] <ncwbqcfe> hehe, agreed
[02:23:06] <ncwbqcfe> stay alert, learn before doing, learn after too :)
[02:25:44] <hajonnes> romainl, yes I have to get better at understanding the vim reference manual. But it is sometimes written rahter convoluted to me. I did read first and :h tw say it wraps text when the text is longer than the value. and :h gq say it applies the formatting. the fo=tcq which autowrap. All fine I thought because tcq is standard and I have written text before that wraps normally. so what is the difference. I think you are worng, normally you actually learn 
[02:25:44] <hajonnes> more form your mistakes. so what is mine ;)

[05:41:48] <the9a3eedi> nova, i've never used neovim. to me it just seems like vim with a bunch of plugins. anyways i ended up installing this: https://github.com/jasonccox/vim-wayland-clipboard , and wl-clipboard which is provided by manjaro/arch repos. it works beautifully

[05:44:26] <nova> I don't understand since neovim is a fork of vim. I am not trying to tell ya to use neovim, but also your understanding of what it is seems inaccurate. glad you found a plugin to make it work
[05:46:45] <nova> the only things "extra" it affords (which you don't have to use) are builtin treesitter for syntax highlighting, builtin LSP, and first-class (nearly) lua support.

[13:04:15] <wyclif> Hey everybody, having a problem with my vim/neovim. I cannot currently get out of INSERT mode by pressing `ESC` or even `Ctrl-[`. I've tried several things to no avail. I have not recently altered the config or updated. I tried starting it in easy mode (`vim -y`) and clean mode (`vim --clean`) to no avail. I'm wondering if I accidentally hit some key combination by mistake that has borked my setup

[13:09:17] <wyclif> habamax: Just figured out, you're right. You have to use `Ctrl-L` in easy mode, right? But even that doesn't work. 
[13:09:37] <romainl> I suggest a reboot

[14:32:10] <cc0a3hr> romainl: will do then
