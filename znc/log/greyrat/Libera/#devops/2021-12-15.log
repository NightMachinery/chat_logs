[01:45:36] <Dus10> have you worked with OPA?
[01:46:06] <Dus10> I am really having a hard time justifying its uses :)
[01:46:48] <Dus10> I think the only thing that could get me over the hurdle is that investing in it as a skill means I could leverage it as a policy platform for other things later, like as a policy service that another system calls
[01:47:13] <Dus10> I am using it for Terraform right now... PowerShell could serve the same purpose rather handily

[01:59:14] <Dus10> I cannot lie... the Rego language that is used to define policies... far from intuitive
[01:59:24] <rawtaz> yeah looks a bit,, new thingie
[01:59:43] <rawtaz> but when did you last learn a new DSL? perhaps it's time, cant let it pass more than a month between
[01:59:59] <Dus10> haha
[02:00:23] <Dus10> honestly, it has been a while... HCL, Jinja2... I dunno
[02:00:24] <Dus10> been using them for a while
[02:00:54] <Dus10> since the input is always JSON, it is just a bit befuddling that you need anything special with it
[02:01:23] <Dus10> I am kind of wondering if I could become the OPA guy, though
[02:01:30] <Dus10> there aren't a ton of resources out there on it
[02:03:00] <rawtaz> have you seen it being used much or prominently?
[02:03:09] <rawtaz> like, is it a thing or looks like it will be
[02:03:13] <Dus10> it is a CNCF project
[02:03:25] <Dus10> so, I expect more people will be getting into it
[02:03:52] <rawtaz> yeah that makes sense
[02:03:53] <Dus10> honestly, since you can run it as a service, it is something that you could use as a policy engine for an application
[02:04:04] <rawtaz> it might be a bit early now but in a year or two perhaps its hot
[02:04:06] <Dus10> that is probably where it has the most promise
[02:04:24] <rawtaz> i think i dont entirely understand the use cases, ill have to read up on that thing :d
[02:04:35] <Dus10> since you can run it on the command-line, it is nice to have multiple use cases for it
[02:04:47] <Dus10> well, it is a general purpose policy system
[02:05:05] <Dus10> you define some policy, compare your input against it... it outputs true or false
[02:05:10] <Dus10> true is you are authorized
[02:05:13] <Dus10> false is you are not
[02:05:31] <Dus10> so, what I am doing is coming up with criteria for Terraform right now
[02:05:46] <Dus10> does this plan require approval or can it just run
[02:06:03] <Dus10> it it passes the policy, then it doesn't need any approval in the pipeline
[02:06:18] <Dus10> if it doesn't pass the policy, someone must manually approve it
[02:07:23] <Dus10> you can create a heuristic model with it
[02:07:37] <Dus10> if your score exceeds a threshold, for instance, then you don't pass
[02:07:51] <Dus10> or you can just outright define if some thing is happening, you don't pass
[02:08:08] <Dus10> and easy one to start with is just determining if any delete operations are happening
[02:08:24] <Dus10> if so, don't authorize; require manual approval

[02:45:11] <rawtaz> sure looks like it has some momentum, this one (noodling around on youtube)
[03:05:28] <lantech19446> do any of you have any experience with web content filtering solutions?
[03:07:13] <slaughter> I hate the concept, does that count?
[03:08:41] <rawtaz> yeah its like, meh. do you really need it? what are you trying to achieve, whats the use case?
[03:09:12] <lantech19446> slaughter: I don't like it either but if we want federal funding I have to have a TPM on every device we own the only thing it will actually filter is pornographic content and p2p file sharing but all the solutions I'm finding are DNS based and that technology sucks

[03:10:05] <rawtaz> what does TPM have to do with web content filtering? :O
[03:10:48] <lantech19446> TPM = technology protection medium it's the term for a web content filter
[03:10:49] <rawtaz> are you just trying to meet some requirements/regulations or are you trying to actually filter/block something specific?
[03:11:05] <rawtaz> hmm ok. i never heard that term before. thought oyu meant Trusted Platform Module
[03:11:26] <rawtaz> so what are the requirements of the use case? what do you actually need to d?
[03:11:27] <rawtaz> do*
[03:11:29] <lantech19446> rawtaz: I need to be cipa compliant which means I have to block anything that could be harmful to a child which means at the very least pornographic content
[03:12:00] <lantech19446> I need wired and wireless networks covered and I also need compatibility with android and ios
[03:12:24] <lantech19446> we used to use k9 and it was awesome but symantec discontinued it
[03:13:05] <rawtaz> there is simply no way to meet that requirement. you simply cannot "block anything that could be harmful to a child" - its impossible :)
[03:13:32] <rawtaz> what are the measurements, like how would a review measure whether or not you are complicant?
[03:13:36] <rawtaz> err compliant*
[03:13:37] <lantech19446> you know that, I know that, the federal government is the one who doesn't seem to know that
[03:13:56] <rawtaz> yes. hence the "real" question there ;)
[03:14:43] <lantech19446> an audit for compliance would involved them coming in seeing our internet safety policy and proof that we held a public meeting at the time it was implemented and then going to any host or multiple hosts on our network to verify that they cannot access obscene content
[03:17:40] <lantech19446> interesting, I just found one that is specifically advertising themselves for library usage to become compliant with cipa
[03:17:53] <lantech19446> and they're the first one that seems to understand that that means every device the library owns
[03:19:06] <rawtaz> well. not sure what to say.
[03:19:43] <rawtaz> i guess that the only thing you can do to be compliant is to use a product that clearly says that if you use it, you are compliant. it's only then that you can argue that you did your job (since reality doesnt have any relevance here, it seems).
[03:20:16] <rawtaz> it's like antivirus - installing and using one can even make things worse than not using one, but its the only way where noone can blame you for anything - as long as you have an AV, even if it's a shitty one, you're "safe".
[03:21:44] <lantech19446> I need to get at least close so that if an auditor comes in and tries one of our nodes it actually blocks most porn sites, this product was too good to be true though no android or ios it's windoze only
[03:22:41] <rawtaz> ah ok
[03:23:12] <lantech19446> I'm gonna get forced into a dns solution and if that's the case I might as well go crawling back to opendns
[03:23:29] <rawtaz> well the problem is that how the heck are you going to do that. for HTTPS as you know youll need the clients to have a known root cert for you to be able to intercept and inspect HTTPS traffic, and even then this wont work when certificates are pinned
[03:24:14] <rawtaz> one thing you could do if you can is to contact other similar operations and see how they solved this
[03:25:47] <lantech19446> open dns is a forwarded service so all the devices on the network already have certificates arranged between them and the originating dns server the opendns service simply returns the correct page or a you've been blocked page based on it's assessment of the website you're trying to reach but i just realized that still won't work for our out of network devices
[03:25:52] <lantech19446> they need something installed
[03:26:52] <rawtaz> well im not talking about blocking with dns - that's completely useless
[03:27:20] <lantech19446> i'm trying to avoid it at all costs but it seems to be the direction all these providers have gone
[03:27:43] <rawtaz> the closest youll get to something thats actually looking at what content is to be displayed is something on the endpoint itself i think. doing it further up the chain is probably not going a long way at all

[03:31:46] <rawtaz> not very cheeap of course..
[03:33:25] <lantech19446> rawtaz: yep used to be made by blue coat then symantec bought them out and killed it it was one of the first filters to incorporate image filtering and behavior based filtering too
[03:33:47] <rawtaz> aha
[03:33:59] <lantech19446> rawtaz: my boss has to way the cost of becoming compliant with how much we'll get in grants and funding not my circus
[03:34:07] <lantech19446> weigh the cost rather
[03:34:31] <rawtaz> sure thing
[03:34:42] <lantech19446> I'm checking out sophos now
[03:36:06] <lantech19446> nope no filtering on that
[03:36:52] <rawtaz> there is, but not on the endpoint :(  https://www.sophos.com/en-us/solutions/compliance/cipa.aspx
[03:37:12] <rawtaz> they have pretty serious filtering on the firewall side but bleh, not usable here
[03:40:07] <rawtaz> checkpoint might have something perhaps. https://www.checkpoint.com/industry/education/

[03:42:25] <rawtaz> but hm. what devices are you talking about - werent you a library? do you supply devices to,, who?
[03:42:35] <lantech19446> works on chromebooks which is good because we have chromebooks
[03:42:52] <lantech19446> we allow patrons to take home chromebooks tablets and hotspots for a month at a time
[03:43:04] <lantech19446> the shitty thing is because we own them we have to filter them
[03:43:23] <lantech19446> this checks all the boxes
[03:43:31] <rawtaz> i havent used checkpoint stuff myself, but i was once very impressed by them at a conference - while a ton of other vendors has sleeky sales faggots who didnt know jack shit about technology, checkpoint turned up with a presenter that was seriously skilled. he showed their cloud based malware detection engine stuff (this was many years ago when it was also very new).

[20:04:27] <nakedeyes> what you guys think of web-servers, do you have one go-to choice or rather it is choice to be made when the context is given?

[20:37:33] <shad> nakedeyes: you know, i used to think ls and cat were stalling too
[20:38:00] <shad> they haven't added feature to these since 1999
[20:38:44] <nakedeyes> i found it difficult to define uncertain routes, upstreams that are not 100% always there. isn't this supposed to be something relatively 'easy'?
[20:40:02] <shad> i'm not sure i follow what you're trying to achieve. I have nginx proxifying my containers using sites in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
[20:40:12] <shad> if my container ain't working, i get a 502, which... is fine ?
[20:40:51] <nakedeyes> shad: we are discussing this on irc. ^^ being old is not necessarily bad.
[20:41:10] <Dus10> I would expect it is more of the norm here :)

[20:42:21] <nakedeyes> shad: yes that is good. the proxy_pass directive is that you use?
[20:42:32] <rawtaz> anyway - which web server software to use depends on your use case and needs and requirements. it's really that simple.
[20:42:39] <rawtaz> theres no one thing fits all

[20:44:53] <shad> nakedeyes: yes exactly
[20:45:50] <shad> i do have the issue of incoming IPs connections not reflecting the true user behind the request at application level, but oh well
[20:47:12] <rawtaz> Dus10: did i say i looked at OPA a bit? sure is interesting :)
[20:47:30] <rawtaz> i cant see you go wrong with becoming proficient with it
[20:47:31] <Dus10> yeah
[20:47:38] <Dus10> I got it working in my system
[20:47:47] <rawtaz> have you integrated some service with it yet?
[20:47:51] <Dus10> I fail if there are any deletes in a Terraform plan
[20:47:54] <rawtaz> i imagine thats where the real how to is
[20:47:58] <Dus10> that will force a manual approval of the pipeline
[20:48:02] <rawtaz> aha
[20:48:08] <rawtaz> nice
[20:48:20] <nakedeyes> wow. the market share of nginx, nginx just happened to dominate apache recently, in May,2021. interesting.
[20:51:09] <rawtaz> i dont think you even have to consider nginx future. it will be around for a long time
[20:53:02] <shad> also it doesn't ship log4j, which is great

[20:53:56] <rawtaz> i havent had any problems due to that vuln lol. i alerted one supplier of it, and they fixed the stuff rapidly. thats it :3
[20:54:25] <shad> depends on the hacker scene speed. Log4j showed that they were pretty fast to set their bots to it once the exploit was in the wild
[20:54:50] *** Joins: sudomann (~sudomann@98.219.211.182)
[20:57:05] <rawtaz> what do you mean set their bots?
[20:57:54] <shad> you ever looked at a publicly facing http server logs ? there's more bot traffic trying to exploit you than actual users
[21:00:07] <rawtaz> yes of course. it takes about four seconds after you set up a server until the first one starts hammering
[21:00:08] <Dus10> next thing you know is we will have to have a new container system for web servers
[21:00:15] <Dus10> VMs virtualize hardware...
[21:00:25] <Dus10> Containers virtualize the operating system....
[21:00:31] <Dus10> ??? virtualize the web server...
[21:00:39] <Dus10> Oh wait, we have had that for decades :)
[21:00:40] <rawtaz> i understand now you meant the hacker scene (presumably the *bad* hackers, since a *real* hacker is actually a good person) when you said "them" :)
[21:01:29] <Dus10> I think that the overhead of web servers is generally low, anyhow
[21:01:42] <Dus10> especially since it spawns threads per request, as it is
[21:02:16] <Dus10> if we just work to reduce the footprint of containers and web services in memory and otherwise, that will improve things
[21:02:21] <rawtaz> heck yeah
[21:02:37] <shad> Dus10: did you just conceptualize k8s ?
[21:02:38] <Dus10> I have an interview at the top of the hour...
[21:02:48] <Dus10> shad: yes :)
[21:02:56] <rawtaz> whatever overhead they have it's not a problem anyway. if you reach the point where it is, then you simply scale out in other ways than with how fast the web server software is
[21:02:59] <Dus10> I should look at the guy's LinkedIn profile
[21:03:13] <rawtaz> Dus10: to know what is *not* true? :-)
[21:03:18] <Dus10> rawtaz: well, if you're cloud... you're paying for that
[21:03:33] <shad> i actually like k8s. Sure it was real hard to start, but once you get the hang of it its really cool to not have to manage stuff at OS level
[21:03:34] <Dus10> efficiency becomes more important when you can attribute spend directly that way
[21:03:43] <shad> less pets, more cattle, all the way
[21:03:50] <rawtaz> yeah but like, its not like theres a relevant difference unless you already have much much higher yielding factors to consider :L)
[21:03:55] <rawtaz> but i hear you
[21:03:57] <Dus10> well, I think fewer folks will be managing k8s infrastructure
[21:04:09] <Dus10> they'll use the managed k8s services in the cloud platforms
[21:04:34] <shad> oh true, when i said i liked k8s, i meant i liked the cloud vendor version 
[21:04:45] <shad> no way i'm spinning up a cluster myself, no no no
[21:04:50] <rawtaz> oh cmon
[21:04:53] <rawtaz> this weekend
[21:05:01] <rawtaz> you, k3s and a bowl of shrimps
[21:05:04] <rawtaz> what a party :)
[21:05:49] <shad> i work with edge device all day, i hope to run k8s self contained on them some day and ditch docker 
[21:06:02] <shad> one of the perks of the job is to type that command sometimes
[21:06:09] <shad> DO NOT TYPE IN A TERMINAL. YOU BEEN WARNED
[21:06:23] <shad> dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1
[21:06:31] <shad> faster than formatting an hdd
[21:06:53] <rawtaz> isnt that when you use something like minicube or k3s, since theyre more lightweight
[21:06:57] <rawtaz> or perhaps even nomad
[21:07:10] <Dus10> I would think so
[21:07:18] <Dus10> huh, this guy isn't showing up on LinkedIn
[21:07:29] <Dus10> wow, a true anti-social-media warrior
[21:07:30] <rawtaz> good sign
[21:07:38] <rawtaz> he's better than all of us :<
[21:08:04] <Dus10> I have LinkedIn and Twitter... and Twitter is only to connect with 2-3 people that basically only use Twitter... and to see what Elon Musk posts
[21:08:42] <rawtaz> hm i wonder if elisabeth ever replied to his reply to her tweet
[21:08:58] <rawtaz> or maybe his reply wasnt to her tweet, i dont remember
[21:09:01] <rawtaz> it was fun anyway
[21:09:37] <Dus10> yeah, this rhetoric needs to stop
[21:09:38] <Dus10> I loved his post
[21:09:41] <shad> rawtaz: yeah, k3s was on the task list
[21:09:56] <Dus10> he will have the record high tax bill in US history...
[21:10:03] <Dus10> time to chill
[21:10:09] <rawtaz> imagine being able to say that "im paying more tax than anyone else in this country" :D
[21:10:10] <shad> but you know, when you are a fire fighter you can't build firewalls at the same time
[21:10:43] <rawtaz> shad: sorry we moved on from k*s, it's all elon now :3
[21:11:17] <Dus10> I am growing tired of hearing about Tesla Solar Roof, though
[21:11:31] <Dus10> they boasted that the latest version increases efficiency by 20-30%
[21:12:03] <Dus10> well, I have been on the reservation list since they announced it... I'd like to have it rather than hear about how great it is
[21:12:29] <Dus10> then I will have clean power for my k3s
[21:12:33] <Dus10> full circle :)
[21:13:14] <shad> i always wonder if the energy produced by solar panel during their lifetime exceeds the energy it cost to produce them
[21:13:42] <rawtaz> yeah thats a good question.
[21:13:47] <rawtaz> and a concerning one
[21:14:39] <shad> that's a complex question that ain't ever answered by hippies
[21:15:34] <shad> In france most of the left is all about ditching nuclear energy for wind & solar, but with the question above is it a great idea ?
[21:15:37] <rawtaz> men were never the smartest kind - try asking hippinettes and youlll probably get a smart answer
[21:16:14] <shad> also, what does it cost to produce the same energy with uranium, let's compare pros & cons
[21:16:42] <shad> it's hard being a pro nuclear leftist hippie these days :<

[21:19:03] <Dus10> it doesn't exceed the energy to produce it
[21:19:16] <Dus10> that would be silly and it would mean the cost would be higher
[21:19:36] <Dus10> energy prices contribute to production costs
[21:19:49] <Dus10> I am pro-nuclear, though
[21:20:14] <Dus10> I just love the independence and person investment in solar, not being beholden to the grid (when paired with batteries)
[21:20:39] <Dus10> but nuclear is where we need to focus for some massive energy production wins
[21:21:01] <Dus10> batteries will still be necessary for peaking demands, though
[21:21:27] <Dus10> and when I say batteries, I just mean generic energy storage, however that manifests
[21:21:38] <shad> thing is, anti nuclear people always say that its dangerous, and its true, if shit happens, shit happens hard
[21:22:22] <shad> But having nuclear energy doesn't exclude having massive security prevention measures.
[21:24:14] <Dus10> there are so many other options for nuclear
[21:24:30] <Dus10> betavoltaics is a pretty cool idea
[21:25:05] <Dus10> they are like photovoltaics, except beta decay (even from "waste nuclear material) does what a photon does in a PV panel
[21:25:22] <Dus10> and Thorium is the real thing
[21:25:38] <nakedeyes> what is the problem with bare-metal k8s clusters?
[21:25:55] <Dus10> do you want to deploy and manage them?
[21:26:07] <Dus10> it is just other work to do that can be rather tedious
[21:27:01] <nakedeyes> i'm curious which is the tedious part.
[21:28:11] <nakedeyes> okay manually bootstrapping nodes is something to do, load balancing, private network, storage solutions are all to be managed, but mostly once. am i too optimistic?

[21:29:30] <Dus10> a frequency of 0 is nice :)

[21:52:26] <slaughter> I hate Confluence.
[21:52:58] <slaughter> Anyone have an intelligent (and maybe even at least semi-automated) solution for linking Confluene docs to code repos?
[21:55:31] <slaughter> I'm thinking about smashing labels on everything and using https://org.atlassian.net/wiki/label/app+database+aws style links in READMEs to generate some kind of scoped documentation links, but that kinda sucks. Labels via URL like that are AND and there's no OR option so the labels would need to be pretty much perfect going in
[21:55:58] <slaughter> IE if you only have the label "app" on a page and you use the above it won't show, it has to have all 3

[22:01:27] <kubblai> slaughter: why not just a standardised readme.md and a link to the docs in it?
[22:01:43] <kubblai> you could SKEL it
[22:02:02] <kubblai> thats what i've done anyway
[22:02:18] <slaughter> Because the documentation for our stuff in Confluence could be spread over multiple spaces/multiple parent pages/etc. I'd still need to address some way of dealing with Confluence
[22:02:35] <kubblai> my way ignores it coz its shite :)
[22:02:52] <slaughter> I do want to standardize the READMEs at some point but first I need to be able to find the docs in Confluence intelligently
[22:03:01] <slaughter> Yeah don't disagree
[22:03:37] <kubblai> sorry for not helping :P
[22:04:29] <slaughter> But can't ignore it. Our apps are too large to smash everything into READMEs. Info when searching for IE database documentation for app1 might be under the app1 space, the engineering space, the retro pages, common issues pages, system design pages, operations, etc etc etc etc
[22:05:18] <slaughter> Too often I ask a question in slack and several people spend time figuring it out and then an hour later someone just links to a 2 year old Confluence doc outlining the exact issue/solution/approach for the question asked
[22:07:14] <kubblai> count yourself lucky that someone in the know still works there - thats the wall im coming up against. This past month i've gone through the commits on 50 or so repos trying to find ppl who still work here and beg them to write a readme
[22:08:09] <kubblai> some ppl have been helpful some ppl just tell me to go fuck myself
[22:16:08] <slaughter> Ouch that sucks
[22:16:32] <slaughter> We're in a sorta same spot, sorta. Not quite the go fuck yourself, at least.
