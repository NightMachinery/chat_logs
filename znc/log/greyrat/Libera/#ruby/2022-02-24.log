[03:03:24] <RedNifre> Hello! A friend of mine, who is not a programmer, would like to program some tiny things. So far, he has only done some medium complex thing in Excel Visual Basic. Is there a simple small ruby book for absolute programming beginners you could recommend?
[03:04:07] <RedNifre> The plan is that I'll visit him, we'll do some Raspberry Pi programming to make some colored LEDs light up on specific dates and I would give him the book as a gift, maybe.
[03:06:05] <weaksauce> RedNifre maybe why's book?
[03:06:41] <weaksauce> https://poignant.guide
[03:09:21] <apotheon> There's also Chris Pine's book (no, not the actor).
[03:10:11] <apotheon> RedNifre: The best book I know for learning basic Ruby is Eloquent Ruby, but I'm not sure whether your friend needs a more-beginner book than that.
[03:11:21] <RedNifre> I'm looking for the most beginner friendly book possible.
[03:12:12] <RedNifre> He's smart, but he prefers writing while loops that manually increment a variable at the end to for loops, because the for construct is so abstract and obfuscates what's going on.
[03:12:38] <apotheon> Chris Pine's Learn To Program or why's Poignant Guide To Ruby, then.

[20:00:25] <mooff> there's a zen to writing hooks like on(:join) { say "hey #{$nick} :)" if $chan == '#coolchan' }
[20:04:01] <mooff> it's more approachable for people new to Ruby poking a weird bot over IRC
[20:04:29] <mooff> and looks a bit like mIRC script, to boot

[20:18:22] <adam12> mooff: Where's $chan coming from?
[20:18:30] <adam12> Is it actually a global?
[20:23:43] *** Joins: bluedust (~bluedust@103.161.144.107)
[20:24:47] <mooff> it really is a global. atm it's set by an early hook along with $msg, $args, $tags, etc
[20:25:28] <mooff> but of course only one bot has the 'luxury' of using globals that way

[20:38:41] <adam12> mooff: Interesting.
