[19:59:25] <MadCamel> blinux: in linux, yes, unless you encrypt the swap partition and enter the passphrase on boot.
[19:59:58] <MadCamel> on windows the bitlocker key is held by the tpm and unsealed via measured boot. the key's used for encryption of the hybernation file
[20:00:58] <blinux> MadCamel: And the whole SSD built in encryption thing may not be secure and you aren't supposed to use that other encryption method used for HDD on SSD I think, which complicates things I believe. That is what I remember from last I researched it.
[20:01:30] <MadCamel> can do that on linux again now too. poettering finally fixed systemd to allow triggering scripts to decrypt block devices. Something he took away in 2008 and only supplied a solution for in 2020..

[20:21:04] <MadCamel> fastest: openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pass pass:"$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=128 count=1 2>/dev/null | base64)" -nosalt < /dev/zero >/dev/usb-stick . It AES encrypts the output of /dev/zero with a random password. Speedy, reasonably random.

[23:05:23] <MadCamel> How it usually works: Hardware validates 1st stage bootloader. This bootloader can never be updated so is normally kept small and simple. 1st stage bootloader finds 2nd stage bootloader and ensures it is signed with an acceptable cryptographic key. 2nd stage bootloader is able to verify the code you ask it to boot is signed.
[23:05:41] *** Joins: leon (~znc@user/leon)
[23:06:07] <MadCamel> 1st stage is often provided by the OEM. Second stage is often uboot or similar.
[23:06:15] * ajak likes systemd-boot
[23:07:05] <MadCamel> I live on the edge and mush my kernel+initrd into a single signed uefi PE executable, no bootloader at all :)
[23:07:24] <ajak> then you have to manage your kernels manually and that's no fun
[23:07:45] <MadCamel> at first yes, but check out sicherboot
[23:08:25] <Jck_true> Maybe you can make sense of this then... https://sable.critical.com/
[23:09:13] <ajak> systemd-boot is already what i use, but with dracut
[23:10:40] <MadCamel> it can be configured to pick up on your distros post-install for kernel packages and sign them, call efibootmgr instead of systemd-boot. Annnnyway

[23:42:54] <relipse> I know someone who might try to evade the law, and I'm wondering how he might do that. My first guess  would be to use a VPN, but if the VPN is located in the US then it would be subject to US laws
[23:43:08] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@user/trevors)
[23:44:04] <wilsonfisk> then you have to worry about any country with legal reciprocity with the US
[23:44:06] <ajak> so use a vpn somewhere else in the world
[23:44:10] <wilsonfisk> (and there's quite a few)
[23:44:37] <ajak> that's a concern, but i'm not sure the US can coerce a foreign entity to do their will
[23:44:44] *** Quits: BOKALDO (~BOKALDO@user/bokaldo) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:45:07] <relipse> so what country would they look at?
[23:45:13] <wilsonfisk> they don't have to coerce anyone if there's legal reciprocity
[23:45:17] <`St0ner> start with countries that dont have an extradition agreement
[23:45:25] <relipse> please enlighten me
[23:45:28] <wilsonfisk> lol
[23:45:37] <wilsonfisk> no `St0ner
[23:45:43] <`St0ner> help you figure out how to commit crime and spill all my secrets? nah bro
[23:46:18] <ajak> wilsonfisk: what do you mean? the US can coerce a VPN provider to start keeping logs?
[23:46:53] <MadCamel> the risk depends entirely on what laws and how motivated law enforcement is to catch them. vpn + torrent = ok. But vpn + edward snowden level leaks = aggregate flowspec data from backbones used to hunt you down.
[23:46:57] <wilsonfisk> VPN providers log anyway and no that's not what I meant
[23:47:27] <relipse> my point is, I want to catch a criminal, I want to learn what avenue he might use to break the law
[23:47:46] <ajak> lol, i'm not sure i'm willing to help with that either
[23:48:04] <relipse> please, this is for the sake of all people and children and families everywhere
[23:48:06] <`St0ner> what kind of n00b question is that
[23:48:17] <`St0ner> what are you even doing working in that field not knowing how that field works
[23:48:26] <ghostbuster> `St0ner: think of the childrens
[23:48:27] <ajak> wilsonfisk: what do you mean then?
[23:48:28] <MadCamel> that's a silly question. The criminal could go outside and walk across the street without a crosswalk. Boom, jaywalking criminal.
[23:48:29] <relipse> i'm learning that's why i'm here
[23:48:48] <ajak> relipse: if you're trying to catch a 'crimina', go to law enforcement
[23:48:50] <relipse> ok do you guys remember proxy servers
[23:48:56] <ajak> s/crimina/criminal/
[23:49:01] <relipse> ajak: i already had, but obviously they have their hands full
[23:49:09] * ghostbuster starts a hair metal band called proxy servers
[23:49:10] <wilsonfisk> https://www.justice.gov/criminal-oia/list-participating-countriesgovernments  is a start
[23:49:10] <`St0ner> go to school or otherwise formally study, get an internship, get experience, then you can make a difference. learning from irc is big LOLs

[23:49:14] <relipse> i think proxy servers were before VPN

[23:50:09] <relipse> don't you know how to evade the law?
[23:50:11] <`St0ner> current level of base knowledge is so poor, it is useless

[23:51:35] <`St0ner> shout out to my GNAA homies
[23:51:39] <mats1> why is it always about vpns
[23:51:54] <ajak> due to all the ads, probably
[23:52:07] <wilsonfisk> that's what they normally use on TV/movies
[23:52:12] *** Quits: spare (~ehtsxz6ns@user/spareproject) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:52:12] <wilsonfisk> it was proxies in the 90's
[23:52:21] <`St0ner> companies like NordVPN are heavily advertising on TV and social media
[23:52:25] *** Joins: spare (~ehtsxz6ns@user/spareproject)
[23:52:26] <relipse> that's what I'm saying, back in the 90s and early 2000s they used proxies
[23:52:37] <relipse> what is the difference between a proxy server and a vpn?
[23:52:40] <`St0ner> random everyday people are asking about VPNs a lot more nowadays due to this heavy mainstream advertising
[23:53:12] <wilsonfisk> people were using them WAY before they started advertising
[23:53:13] <`St0ner> relipse: at least try asking questions here that cant be answered within 10 seconds of google
[23:53:17] <ajak> proxies are generally protocol specific while you can often route everything over a vpn
[23:53:54] <MadCamel> netflow data from every tier1 backbone is being collected by companies that specialize in selling tracing services to high-end law enforcement. Tracing VPNs is trivial at that scale. They just don't want to pay big bucks to track down every movie pirate.
[23:53:58] <relipse> so how does a criminal do his deeds?
[23:54:12] <mats1> find a cafe without nearby cctv, wear a mask and walk to it, change your mac address, use a high gain wifi antenna, download your donkey show
[23:55:00] <ghostbuster> dirty deeds done dirt cheap
[23:55:02] *** Joins: LysergicAcid (~LysergicA@user/LysergicAcid)
[23:55:02] <MadCamel> Just download your donkey show without any of that. In most jurisdictions it's not illegal to watch a donkey show. Just produce or distribute.
[23:55:02] <grandpa_grim> curloop from your vps to a webshell and use the webshell to download your donkeyshow.
[23:55:07] <ajak> mats1: doesn't really scale well
[23:55:14] <mats1> i guess if you live in a surveillance state, you might want to use a vpn to evade local security services
[23:56:07] *** Joins: mogrim (~mogrim@gateway/tor-sasl/mogrim)
[23:57:01] <ghostbuster> watch out for rubber hose cryptography
[23:57:15] <MadCamel> like any tool it has its uses I'm sure. it's one of those things that got over-marketed into the consumer space. those big ads that geolocate peoples IPs and tell them they're gonna get hacked without a vpn.. whee
[23:57:45] <mats1> its also not expensive to crack some shmuck's ap, and someone else gets rubber hosed for a few days
[23:58:16] <MadCamel> yeah but there are cameras everywhere now.. might want to crack that AP from a long distance away
[23:58:38] <MadCamel> or fid a way to steal some docsis3 certificates :D
[23:58:52] <mats1> just walking by is enough to pick up some hashes
