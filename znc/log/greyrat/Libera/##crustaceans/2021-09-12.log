[01:43:11] *** Quits: mouseghost (~draco@user/mouseghost) (Quit: mew wew)
[01:43:14] <quanticle> I feel like one of the reasons we have the problem of US extremism is because we sent a bunch of people out to fight on our behalf for 20 years, telling them the whole time, "Oh, you're the best of us," and "Thank you for your service," while doing absolutely nothing concretely to indicate that we appreciated, or even understood what they were doing out there.
[01:45:10] <quanticle> And so many veterans come back and are profoundly alienated by a society that simulatenously claims to venerate them, but in reality treats them like disposable cannon fodder.
[01:46:04] <quanticle> And it all circles back to Bush and his decisions to launch forever wars instead of limited military strikes intended to kill Osama Bin Laden (and nothing else)
[01:46:59] <quanticle> So tl;dr: I'm mad that Bush is talking about domestic extremism as if it were some kind of sui generis problem as opposed to one that he and his administration had a hand in creating.

[01:59:07] <manicennui> Americans learned nothing from 9/11.
[01:59:16] <manicennui> They just focus on being angry about it.
[01:59:19] <quanticle> Yeah, it has, but let's put it this way: a large underclass of disaffected veterans has always led to political violence, in *all* societies.
[01:59:49] <jjuran> THESE COLORS DON'T RUN
[02:00:13] <manicennui> Killing Osama would not have changed anything either.
[02:00:22] <manicennui> We need to fix our foreign and energy policies.
[02:01:10] <quanticle> Energy policy? Wait, do you actually believe that Iraq was about "blood for oil"?
[02:01:49] <manicennui> I don't think it's as simple as "taking their oil", but our interest in the region is oil.
[02:01:58] <Brekkjern> I can't wait until we're like 50 years away from this shitstorm so historians can actually figure out WTF was going on.
[02:02:30] <manicennui> Iraq also had nothing to do with 9/11
[02:02:48] <quanticle> manicennui: Nope, wrong. "Blood for oil" is too optimistic by half. You know what the *real* reason was for our hitting Iraq?
[02:02:51] <quanticle> Literally to show we could
[02:02:57] <quanticle> They themselves admit it: https://scholars-stage.org/learning-from-our-defeat-1-the-assumptions-of-donald-rumsfeld/
[02:02:58] <buttsbot> Learning From Our Defeat: The Assumptions of Donald Rumsfeld – The Scholar's Stage
[02:03:17] <quanticle> Douglas Feith wrote an entire book about how he, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz planned the Iraq war
[02:03:40] <quanticle> And their entire justification boiled down to, "America needed to show that it could hit back"
[02:04:50] <quanticle> There was no geopolitical calculation. There was no strategy. There was no consideration for natural resources. This was literally the leaders of an imperial power deciding to take military action for no reason other than to demonstrate their might
[02:05:38] <quanticle> Because 9/11 made "us" look weak and we needed to demonstrate to "them" that we were still strong. Who is "them"? That is a question that we have yet to answer.
[02:06:13] <manicennui> The entire history of the situation leads back to access to foreign oil, period.
[02:06:31] <manicennui> We don't randomly pick places to care about fighting.
[02:06:43] <quanticle> We kind of do, actually! That's my entire point!
[02:07:11] <quanticle> We picked Iraq for no reason other than it seemed like a power that was opposed to us and which would not be too much trouble to take down
[02:07:15] <quanticle> We also considered North Korea
[02:08:08] <quanticle> And we didn't even get the oil! That's the saddest part. The Chinese got the oil
[02:08:21] <quanticle> The Iraqi oilfield development contracts went to CNOOC
[02:08:53] <manicennui> quanticle: The most recent war wasn't the start of our involvement in Iraq.
[02:09:07] <manicennui> Not even the start of Rumsfeld involvement
[02:09:39] <manicennui> Our involvement in the region started a century ago.
[02:09:39] <quanticle> No, it wasn't, but my point is that Rumsfeld, et. al. could very easily have chosen a different country to have a forever war in
[02:09:40] <ngoldbaum> quanticle: a healthy dose of convincing yourself real hard that classified shaky evidence is good, dick cheney had a direct line in 2001 and 2002 to basically a twitter feed from the CIA with all the unverified intelligence reports they were seeing
[02:10:00] <quanticle> And they almost did
[02:10:06] <manicennui> And it led to all of the recent bullshit.
[02:10:24] <ngoldbaum> and he cherry picked stuff and clung to it because of course saddam is making wmds
[02:10:30] <quanticle> ngoldbaum: Yeah, there's that too. The 1% doctrine, etc, etc.
[02:10:36] <ngoldbaum> also the media bought it hook line and sinker
[02:11:18] <quanticle> Yeah, I'm reminded of that every time the New York Times bleats about "fake news", like, buddy, the OG fake news was the case for the Iraq War that was printed in your pages without an iota of skepticism.
[02:11:23] <ngoldbaum> like i think dick cheney and paul wolfowitz probably earnestly believed the wmds were there and they just needed to massage intelligence a little bit to concinc
[02:11:28] <ngoldbaum> e other people
[02:12:30] <quanticle> Oh, they believed the WMDs were there all right, but in their heart of hearts, they also knew that even if Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs, he wasn't a threat. The real reason they invaded was because he was loud and proud against the US
[02:12:41] <quanticle> (And also because he didn't have any friends)
[02:13:24] <quanticle> If we invaded North Korea, there was a chance that the Chinese would intervene on the side of the North Koreans. But who would mount a military intervention to defend Saddam?
[02:14:28] <manicennui> They didn't actually care about WMD
[02:14:39] <manicennui> And a country having WMD is not justification to invade.
[02:14:58] <manicennui> It's just what they were able to use to convince the idiot masses.
[02:16:20] <quanticle> Right
[02:16:36] <quanticle> And the media also knew, but did it anyway
[02:19:40] <manicennui> A large number of ring wing assholes who claim to be worried about sovereignty sure are willing to trample the sovereignty of other countries if they become the slightest bit afraid.
[02:20:11] <manicennui> Sovereignty for me, oppression for thee!
[02:23:18] <quanticle> lol
[02:23:41] <quanticle> Right-wing hypocrisy: the gift that keeps on giving
[02:26:31] <manicennui> My only hope is that things like this (what Bush said) continues to splinter the Republican party so they can't win elections.
[02:27:11] <Brekkjern> As long as they can still point to some democrat as being "the enemy", then I doubt it will splinter fuck all.
[02:27:27] <quanticle> ^
[02:28:31] <quanticle> As long as they can get their crazy conspiracy theorists, libertarian corporatists, warmongers and religious nutcases to all hate Biden enough to show up to vote in November, it won't matter how much each of those factions hate each other
[02:29:37] <quanticle> Literally me: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E-9Ne2tVIAIFNXl?format=jpg&name=large
[02:30:22] <quanticle> I found myself in that situation on Thursday. "Okay, you wrote this ingestion code?" "Yep." "So how does it work?" "No idea, lol"
[02:30:23] <riv> oh shit
[02:30:28] <riv> this did not occur to me before
[02:30:40] <riv> but yeah if they push the vaccine stuff too hard, it could cause a big backlash
[02:33:47] <manicennui> I think there are a good number of life-long Republicans who voted for Biden this time.
[02:34:10] <Brekkjern> Not enough
[02:34:45] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I mean, he won.

[02:43:39] <quanticle> How
[02:43:44] <quanticle> How do you "pause" baby deliveries?
[02:44:08] <manicennui> Direct them elsewhere.

[02:46:05] <manicennui> Fucking morons.

[05:10:19] <quanticle> But... why?
[05:10:33] <quanticle> Of all the things you could re-implement in C, why Docker?
[05:11:26] <manicennui> To introduce more security flaws so more support contracts can be sold.
[05:11:41] <manicennui> But obviously it should be Rust so it can be called Rocker

[05:13:39] <manicennui> NO.
[05:13:42] <manicennui> Sorry.
[05:13:43] <manicennui> No.
[05:13:53] <manicennui> But I think it is common.
[05:17:10] <quanticle> Hmmm... maybe there's some other reason, then?
[05:17:56] <manicennui> I don't try to figure out why geeks do the things they do.
[05:20:15] <quanticle> A wise policy
[05:21:15] <prussian> well lucky for them, crun exists to fit with it.
[05:41:08] <dimadima> i need to look up if kubernetes will remove the ability to use docker containers at some point
[05:41:26] <dimadima> i don't know any other kind of container
[05:42:04] <manicennui> My understanding is that everyone is moving to a standard container image format that is based on the last docker image format.
[05:42:23] <manicennui> And there are multiple container runtimes including a docker one.

[05:44:03] <dimadima> redhat
[05:44:27] <dimadima> what's the deal with redhat? who are their customers?
[05:45:06] <manicennui> Large companies who were afraid of Linux.
[05:45:24] <manicennui> They also package and support several other large open source projects.
[05:47:25] <quanticle> Who are their customers? Basically everyone who uses deploys Linux commercially.
[05:47:59] <quanticle> Red Hat is the standard corporate Linux distro
[05:49:09] <dimadima> like for running what at corporations?
[05:49:27] <dimadima> don't corporations all use windows
[05:49:43] <quanticle> No
[05:50:04] <quanticle> Like, Amazon? AmazonLinux is a repackaged RHEL
[05:50:43] <quanticle> When I was at Amazon, all our desktops ran RHEL 5
[05:50:49] <manicennui> Windows dominates "back office" servers, but not Internet facing stuff.
[05:51:00] <quanticle> No, not even that any more
[05:51:03] <dimadima> so they run their VMs on AmazonLinux and have a license agreement w/ redhat?
[05:51:04] <manicennui> Eh.
[05:51:15] <manicennui> Most accounting, etc. software is still going to be Windows.
[05:51:22] <quanticle> manicennui: Yeah, on client machines
[05:51:24] <quanticle> Not servers
[05:51:38] <manicennui> The biggest change is companies using hosted software for email and HR and stuff.
[05:51:42] <quanticle> Other than ActiveDirectory and Exchange, most back office servers are Linux
[05:51:50] <quanticle> And have been for a long time
[05:51:58] <quanticle> Ever since line of business apps became webapps
[05:52:04] <dimadima> all your desktops at amazon ran RHEL? don't developers have laptops?L
[05:52:05] <quanticle> Instead of desktop software
[05:52:26] <quanticle> dimadima: Laptops ran Windows, or MacOS, or Linux
[05:52:26] <dimadima> ah
[05:52:41] <quanticle> But this was in 2012
[05:52:51] <dimadima> so in 2012 some people still have desktops and those were RHEL?
[05:52:51] <quanticle> So back then you couldn't really do dev work on a laptop
[05:52:57] <dimadima> and these were devs orrrrr admin ppl?
[05:53:02] <quanticle> Devs
[05:53:06] <dimadima> okay hmm
[05:53:15] <dimadima> weird though
[05:53:39] <quanticle> But yeah, my dad works at Wells Fargo, all their servers (except for the aforementioned Exchange and ActiveDirectory) are Linux
[05:53:43] <dimadima> amazon, a tech company, licenses RHEL and put it on dev desktops at least as late as 2012
[05:53:45] <quanticle> And they use RHEL
[05:54:17] <dimadima> so then where does all their cobol run?
[05:54:21] <quanticle> Mainframes
[05:54:21] <dimadima> VMs on RHEL?
[05:54:24] <quanticle> Running ZOS
[05:54:28] <dimadima> huh
[05:54:34] <dimadima> WF is running mainframes ?
[05:54:38] <quanticle> EYeah
[05:54:39] <dimadima> physically?
[05:54:40] <dimadima> lol
[05:54:41] <dimadima> what
[05:54:45] <quanticle> What do you mean, lol
[05:54:46] <prussian> LPARin it up.
[05:55:07] <dimadima> i just assumed anything would have been running on vritual
[05:55:17] <dimadima> emulators
[05:55:32] <manicennui> Any bank as large and as old as Wells Fargo almost certainly has multiple mainframe servers.
[05:55:36] <quanticle> Like, you do realize that what we're doing, with all this containerization and Kubernetes, and whatnot is literally just reinventing the tools to deploy software that IBM, Unisys and all the other mainframe folks invented in like... 1975, right
[05:55:36] <dimadima> just hard to imagine they have a mainframe computer sitting there that people are maintaining
[05:56:43] <dimadima> i just meant i'm amused that somewhere a computer from 1975 is running
[05:56:54] <dimadima> like it's hot and loud

[05:56:56] <buttsbot> IBM Gains as Mainframes Help Fuel an Earnings Beat: 6 Key Takeaways - RealMoney
[05:57:13] <dimadima> it's a living artifact
[05:57:21] <manicennui> "This in turn was fueled by a 69% increase in IBM Z mainframe revenue (up from Q1's 59% growth), as the z15 mainframe (launched last September) continues seeing a healthy upgrade cycle."
[05:57:44] <dimadima> am i musunderrstanding this?
[05:57:55] <dimadima> is this some kind of modern mainframe?
[05:58:02] <manicennui> Define "modern".
[05:58:09] <dimadima> "launched last September"
[05:58:11] <dimadima> for example
[05:58:14] <quanticle> Oh, it's not literally a computer from 1975... well... I don't *think* it's a computer from 1975
[05:58:23] <quanticle> People still build mainframes, you know
[05:58:26] <prussian> it probably pretends to be if you hit it hard enough
[05:58:27] <manicennui> There are probably sold old machines still running.
[05:58:30] <dimadima> i think i might not know
[05:58:33] <quanticle> You can buy one from IBM if you have a lot of money
[05:58:35] <manicennui> s/sold/still/
[05:58:39] <manicennui> ugh/
[05:58:43] <manicennui> s/sold//
[05:59:16] <dimadima> why would i buy a 2020 mainframe and what is a 2020 "mainframe" i think i have a lot of reading to do
[05:59:23] <quanticle> manicennui: Yeah, but I don't *think* there are any that are 45 years old. That's a little extreme...
[05:59:25] <manicennui> dimadima: Almost no one talks about the bulk of software on sites like lobsters.
[05:59:31] <manicennui> dimadima: It's not sexy.
[05:59:45] <manicennui> Nor most industries.
[05:59:50] <quanticle> The bulk of software, at this point, is probably a bunch of C and Java code on various embedded systems
[05:59:51] <prussian> dimadima: because you have a 2010 mainframe and your support contract to keep it running sucks a lot of money probably.

[06:00:28] <dimadima> IBM says What is a mainframe? It's a style of computing
[06:00:46] <manicennui> A mainframe is basically a "private cloud" from 50 years ago.
[06:01:02] <manicennui> Nothing in computing is new.
[06:01:04] <dimadima> i'll read this later https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos-basic-skills?topic=today-what-is-mainframe-its-style-computing
[06:01:05] <buttsbot> What is a mainframe? It's a style of computing
[06:02:01] <dimadima> so mainframe is an IBM trademark?
[06:02:20] <quanticle> No
[06:02:28] <quanticle> But only IBM makes mainframes these days
[06:02:38] <dimadima> apparently not
[06:02:39] <dimadima> yeah
[06:02:48] <quanticle> The other mainframe manufacturers, Unisys, Data General, DEC, etc, all went out of business

[21:59:15] <Brekkjern> Because IRC wasn't designed in 2012, nor was it expected that the operators would have anything more powerful than a toaster to run it on...
[21:59:27] <Brekkjern> Why do I read HN comments?
[21:59:43] <Brekkjern> It inevitably only takes 2 comments before some absolute idiocy is posted.
[22:00:20] <riv> > why would it be hard to manage tens of thousands of concurrent connections
[22:00:27] <riv> i was wondering this too
[22:00:38] <riv> apparently it's hard to manage a lot of file descriptors
[22:00:46] <riv> im not sure the exact numbers
[22:03:04] <riv> so whatsapp managed to do it using erlang
[22:04:20] <manicennui> It would be harder to implement netsplits on a single server.
[22:04:34] <manicennui> And netsplits are key to the IRC experience.
[22:04:55] <prussian> so true.
[22:05:05] <riv> :D
[22:05:12] <prussian> riv: probably. if we are still talking ancient posixisms
[22:05:13] <prussian> like
[22:05:16] <prussian> what, select()?
[22:05:24] <riv> yeah select has a limit of 1024
[22:05:35] <riv> but apparently poll/epoll can handle much more with less effort
[22:05:37] <prussian> I don't remember. I hate working with libc-isms and C in general so I wish all that to the corn field.
[22:05:53] <prussian> and then end up using poll or controversial things like signalfd and whatnot
[22:06:43] <prussian> ya... I don't think there is any real upperbound on open FD's outside of backwards compat crutching for libc's
[22:06:58] <prussian> well, and the limits set
[22:07:14] <cb> til riv is a little fox with a hat?
[22:07:33] <mouseghost> riv, after all, i think erlang is suspected to the same file descriptors limits?
[22:07:45] <cb> but it is funny that originally irc is a federated protocol thats federation was reduced to load balancing
[22:08:24] <riv> cb yes
[22:08:39] <prussian> i did not know what a riv was. til
[22:09:01] <riv> I don't know how erlang works
[22:09:20] <riv> c355 pointed me to something very interesting about userland network stacks
[22:09:23] <riv> which is a new idea to me
[22:09:34] <prussian> also I don't think the argument in this gist is quite right. I don't see why EVERY message would have to be forwarded to every 40k connection
[22:09:46] <mouseghost> riv, erlang runs in a vm, but i think it runs over the kernel, not instead of it
[22:10:08] <mouseghost> but as youve said on #lobsters, theres that max fds limit
[22:10:10] <riv> prussian, yeah that's true - it's a conservative estimate, so in actuality things are even better than this
[22:11:14] <mouseghost> and i guess erlang might help to distribute the load more better, since you have great communication facilities. so perhaps they could run multiple processes (for sure) more easily?
[22:11:53] <cb> Erlang™
[22:12:06] <riv> yeah, and the ability to update the code while its still running is amazing
[22:12:14] <riv> get those 9s
[22:17:05] <prussian> mouseghost: I don't really think there is (practical limit) as long as the kernel can allocate to accomidate it. if you use the bash builtin `ulimit` it tells you the soft limits which are user contrallable.
[22:17:15] <prussian> -H if you want to see the "hard" ones.
[22:17:33] <mouseghost> ye riv showed it to me
[22:17:34] <prussian> my hard fd limit is basically half a million
[22:17:37] <prussian> oh
[22:35:12] <Brekkjern> What sadistic fuck gives implementing a teque as the first task for a course on algorithms?
[22:38:55] <manicennui> A what?
[22:39:12] <Brekkjern> A triple ended queue
[22:39:17] <Brekkjern> It should have a middle as well
[22:40:18] <Brekkjern> Essentially, they have given us this task: https://open.kattis.com/problems/teque
[22:40:18] <buttsbot> Teque – Kattis, Kattis
[22:40:55] <manicennui> Wouldn't you just use a doubly linked list?
[22:41:13] <Brekkjern> How do you insert in the middle of that list in O(1)
[22:41:19] <Brekkjern> ?
[22:42:03] <Brekkjern> And also keep the pointer to the middle current
[22:42:42] <manicennui> Where does it say that it has to be O(1)?
[22:43:13] <Brekkjern> Not in that text, but in the one handed out to us
[22:43:23] <Brekkjern> Or rather, it has to be "efficcient"
[22:49:32] <manicennui> Looking at a potential solution, I guess I'm not clear on what "middle" means.
[22:51:07] <manicennui> It seems to just mean "somewhere between the items that have been pushed to the front and the items that have been pushed to the end"?
[22:51:32] <prussian> kattis? damn. I'm sorry.
[22:51:40] <prussian> gl Brekkjern
[22:51:58] <Brekkjern> Ty
[22:52:01] <Brekkjern> Gonna need it...
[22:52:11] <manicennui> Although the description on kattis seems to indicate that it should be the exact middle.
[22:52:17] <Brekkjern> Yes
[22:52:40] <Brekkjern> The workload on this course is fucking ridiculous
[22:53:28] <prussian> There was a teacher like that at my school. I got paid like a few hundred bucks to tutor some BIS majors taking his class, lol

[23:08:34] <Brekkjern> Bleh. This is almost working, but it's failing on 2/3rds of the test cases...
[23:14:10] <pja> Brekkjern: Given you're implementing a teque, I would take "insert in the middle" to mean the 3rd of the ends, not some arbitrary middle point.
[23:14:53] <Brekkjern> >push_middle x: insert the element x into the middle of the teque. The inserted element x now becomes the new middle element of the teque. If k is the size of the teque before the insertion, the insertion index for x is (k+1)/2 (using 0-based indexing).
[23:14:54] <pja> manicennui: "Debate me, cowards!"
[23:15:21] <riv> teque is a made up datastructure. not real..
[23:15:34] <mouseghost> so i see libera is much more liberal hmm
[23:15:40] <pja> Right, so your teque has 3 stable points - start, middle & end. Inserting in the middle then updates the middle point.
[23:15:42] <Brekkjern> riv: That doesn't stop this course from testing us in it...
[23:15:47] <manicennui> mouseghost: Than what?
[23:15:54] <pja> I have never needed a teque. Deque, yes.
[23:15:56] <mouseghost> manicennui, p0rn
[23:16:08] <manicennui> mouseghost: I don't follow.
[23:16:15] <mouseghost> or wait, nvm, i was on another net
[23:16:15] <Brekkjern> I have never needed one either...
[23:16:31] <pja> You can fairly obviously make a teque from 2 deques & a little updating logic based on keeping the length of of the 2 deques.
[23:17:18] <Brekkjern> That's what I am working on now
[23:17:59] <manicennui> That is what the solution I was looking at seemed to do.
[23:18:08] <pja> It's a deque for inserting at the ends, and in the middle you insert onto the end of the shortest one, or if they're of equal length an arbitrary one.
[23:18:33] <manicennui> Yeah, it didn't seem to necessarily insert into the exact middle.
[23:18:44] <pja> You can just remember whether they're the same length or not & always insert into them in the same order.
[23:18:55] <manicennui> Hmm.
[23:19:00] <pja> deletion is the inverse of insertion.
[23:19:16] <Brekkjern> Luckily I don't have to implement deletion...
[23:22:17] <pja> manicennui: If you don't consistently do your insertions, then your middle point will wander up & down the teque.
[23:22:18] <manicennui> Hmm. It seems like most special interest discussion websites have been abandoned these days.
[23:22:24] <pja> Which doesn't fit the spec.
[23:22:40] <manicennui> pja: Yeah, I realized that I probably didn't look at the insertion on the beginning/end closely enough.
[23:22:56] <manicennui> So many communities seem to have moved to reddit or something, but reddit is so superficial.
[23:23:21] <manicennui> I can't even remember the last time I joined a discord that was actually active.
[23:23:27] <pja> manicennui: There's something quite distancing about reddit - it doesn't seem to foster actual community in the way other spaces do.
[23:23:27] <manicennui> Even if they have thousands of people online.
[23:23:45] <riv> that's really true
[23:23:49] <riv> i wonder if it's the size or something else
[23:23:51] <manicennui> There will be like 3 people chatting maybe, and I can't follow wtf they are talking about.
[23:24:35] <pja> To be fair, unless you have a small community, IRC can be similar. You need that regular interaction with the same group of people to build relationships.
[23:24:46] <pja> Discord likewise.
[23:25:20] <manicennui> I think you could understand what is going on in this channel if you randomly joined.
[23:25:33] <manicennui> There are some inside jokes, but it's mostly just nerd discussion.
[23:27:36] <manicennui> I basically want this channel, but more focused on art, music, and culture.
[23:27:47] <pja> manicennui: I hear you.
[23:28:48] <pja> metafilter used to provide some of that for me, but the community went in a direction that was not my preferred mode of interaction & I quit last year sometime.
[23:29:29] <mouseghost> discord being more accessible is more prone to groups of friends forming, at least on furry servers, in my opinion
[23:29:48] <manicennui> I feel like most discord servers have far too many channels, and most of them are dead.
[23:29:54] <manicennui> I also can't stand the discord UI>
[23:29:55] <manicennui> .
[23:30:51] <manicennui> Slack tends to be the same, but there are generally a couple of super active channels on tech slacks.
[23:31:02] <manicennui> And I don't mind Slack's UI as much (flame on).
[23:35:29] <blissful> slack's threading makes makes large groups ok
[23:35:35] <blissful> not great, but beareable
