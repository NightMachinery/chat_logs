[00:01:49] <danielsousaio> submodules might help achieve that, check man git-status and look for the setting status.submoduleSummary
[00:01:50] <gitinfo> the git-status manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-status.html

[00:03:18] <danielsousaio> yes, I was suggesting a repository with all of those repositories as submodules, so that you can issue git commands recursively/in bulk
[00:03:57] <danielsousaio> if you'd prefer to stick with your repositories, and you have them in normalized locations, you could write a bash script perhaps - but that's much more work
[00:05:01] *** Joins: Raguile (~Raguile@user/raguile)
[00:05:12] <Codaraxis> Yeah. I was hoping to avoid the approach of writing my own script. Doable, but the time aside, there's also the inevitable problem of unforeseen edge cases that get discovered as time goes by
[00:06:26] <Codaraxis> If I had a grand repo with loads of submodules, I'd have to work in there too
[00:06:58] <danielsousaio> Codarix search around for the --recurse-submodules flag in the submodules man page, if I understood it correctly, it will let you run commands for all the git submodules
[00:07:36] <Codaraxis> Will do, thanks

[07:05:55] <mackerman> Try some until you find one you keep using.
[07:06:23] <junon> Curious, what does a GUI provide that the CLI does not?
[07:06:38] <mackerman> Easier to read graphs.
[07:06:47] <junon> What kind of graphs

[07:11:26] <mackerman> Colored side by side diffs.
[07:11:49] <Square> junon, I could go on all day but having to remember and typing commands for every interaction with git requires you to remembering all commands. Noting commit ids, copy them paste them on command line. I use UI's mostly for viewing state of repository, compare branches, see affected files etc.
[07:12:17] <junon> mackerman: all of those things can be accomplished with the terminal.
[07:12:37] <Square> ops.. repeated myself there. But yeah. Viewing the repository through just selecting things.
[07:12:58] <junon> Square: git has aliases for this sort of thing. Copying commit hashes around is still going to be required if you use a GUI anyway, it's not like it can abstract away the concepts of Git.
[07:13:16] <junon> You're just moving the work from a terminal window to a git GUI window, not much will have changed.
[07:13:45] <junon> The reason I ask at all is because almost 100% of the time someone (e.g. at work) asks for a Git GUI it's really an X-Y problem they're facing.
[07:16:17] <Square> i know all these things. I've seen "power users" that limit themselves to terminal. If i can do something with 3 clicks, relieves my hands from typing too.
[07:18:31] <mackerman> cli is a necessary skill,  but isn't the only way to do UX.
[07:20:50] <Square> Right. if i do interactive rebase, reset etc i dont demand my UI to have that.

[07:31:40] <Square> one could argue that git requires you to know the repository model. Terminal is never gonna achieve that. For git to be used by your grandparents someone needs to make a UI that lets them.
[07:32:08] <junon> Git is not made for grandparents. It's make for developers.
[07:32:14] <junon> s/make/made/
[07:32:30] <junon> The goal of Git is to be useful for developers, not for the average user
[07:34:00] <Square> thats just linux-beard man talk.
[07:34:29] <junon> That's not a great argument.
[07:38:03] <Square> im a developer myself. I think many users could use GIT for different type of document creation. If there money in it i could see how non power users could adopt git if they were not forced to do terminal hacking.

[13:13:33] <euouae> Hello
[13:13:53] <euouae> I'm trying to understand better how to have various branches for my personal project
[13:14:24] <euouae> Right now I have a `main` branch and I thought I could add a `dev`. I know the git book calls them 'silos', there's more activity closer to bleeding edge and then you merge into them
[13:14:55] <euouae> But I don't quite know what the difference is between `main` and `dev` and so on. I'm struggling to understand, and some examples online seem to only use `main` for tagged release commits?
[13:15:19] <euouae> But this also makes no sense -- tags are good enough for that purpose, there's no reason to have a branch dedicated to release commits

[14:30:19] <sanz> also I tried  ssh://[administrator@127.0.0.1:2222]:/path/to/project... no luck
[14:32:03] <euouae> The advice appears to be to change the default openSSH shell to git's bash.exe
[14:32:08] <sanz> So I'm waiting for a decent answer here, as suggested by SCM manual
[14:32:25] <euouae> run `powershell` and use `New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH" -Name DefaultShell -Value "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" -PropertyType String -Force`
[14:32:52] <euouae> Then restart the VM or at least restart openSSH daemon and connections
[14:33:32] <euouae> You may need to edit the path to Git/bin/bash.exe as appropriate for your machine
[14:34:52] <euouae> then `git pull ssh://administrator@127.0.0.1:2222/c/users/administrator/path/to/project` should work

[14:38:31] <euouae> you're welcome.
[14:38:38] <sanz> could you pls explain what was going on here?

[14:39:53] <euouae> I think `git` or `ssh` is using the default shell to do some work. The paths that are being sent are not properly quoted for the default shell. The shell that comes with git can work with them.
[14:41:18] <sanz> nice! you just made my day, though evening here. tks again

[14:44:24] <osse> euouae: I don't think there's a general answer to your question. It depends on what the maintainers of each project want.
[14:45:13] <osse> I think projects with both master/main and a dev branch consider the main branch "stable" and the dev branch "unstable"
[14:45:55] <euouae> osse I'm the only person in the project, I'm trying to decide on something sensible and stick to it.
[14:46:18] <euouae> What is "stable" though? Users shouldn't use the branches, they should use the tarball releases right?
[14:46:44] <euouae> perhaps I can understand that `main` should contain commits that compile and `dev` is allowed to temporarily break? Is that sensible?
[14:49:09] <osse> euouae: The latter is what I was think of, yes.
[14:49:44] <osse> When I'm the only developer I only have one branch, unless I'm working on different things at the same time
[14:50:10] <euouae> That's true osse I'm trying to get some experience using git in an imaginary big project
[14:52:23] <osse> The git project itself has no long-running dev branch. master *is* the dev branch. Anything that goes into master is considered an improvement of what's already there
[14:53:28] <sanz> I would use "realase"+"dev". If you need to consider co-work with others, find a more commonly-accepted way. otherwise, you just make the rules.

[21:28:27] <flmbray> Question... let's say I have a branch A, and I create a branch B based on A, but nothing is committed to B.  And say that before B was created, I had a commit C that was based on A, but I really want it to "live" on the B branch.  Does rebasing C onto B actually do anything, since both A (the current parent of C) and B (the desired parent of C) really point to the same commit?  Or is this like a "do-nothing" operation?

[21:29:41] <junon> Commits can't be based on branches. You mean branch A's HEAD was the commit C, before you created branch B? If so, then branch B's HEAD will also be A's HEAD upon creation, thus both branches will point to the same commit.
[21:29:53] <junon> In which case, yes a rebase of branch B on branch A would be a no-op.

[21:30:41] <junon> If you wanted to remove branch A's commit C *after* you create branch B, then assuming commit C is at HEAD, you can run `git reset --hard HEAD~1` (the `~1` here meaning "the first parent of [HEAD]")
[21:30:57] <junon> In which case, branch B will still point to commit C, but branch A will point to commit C's parent commit

[21:41:04] <flmbray> on the remote there was branch A, which I also had locally.  I created a local commit C against my local A HEAD.  Then, our admin created a remote branch B based on the remote branch A.  I ran fetch and so now I see A/B - C.  That is, both A and B are the same commit, A is tracking origin (in VSCode GitGraph extension, it shows as A|origin), but B isn't (yet, I think - it just shows as B, not B|origin - I suppose because
[21:41:04] <flmbray> there are no commits that I have locally??).  We are not expecting any more commits against A (it is actually a release branch that I had done some work for in C, but they weren't ready when we deployed).  Branch B is the "next release" branch, and so I want to move my C to B so that it tracks on the next release.   Actually as I think thru this I think I understand now... I think I would have to rebase C to B, so that it's
[21:41:05] <flmbray> part of the "next release" - otherwise, C would be more like a hotfix against A and would not be included in next release if I don't.  Am I close??  :)

[21:48:33] <junon> otherwise, if A and B have diverged and you don't want to merge, but you still want the changes that C introduced, you can instead do `git checkout B; git cherry-pick C`.
[21:49:08] <junon> which will "replay" the diff that C introduced, by themselves, onto whatever is on HEAD. If it can apply cleanly (no conflicts) then it adds it as a new commit with the exact same changes, author information, and commit message.

[21:57:33] <rawtaz> junon: didnt you mean `git checkout B; git merge --ff C`?
[21:57:33] <flmbray> ok i think I follow...  but won't both the merge & cherry-pick leave my C branch pointing at the one commit I added to C?  if I have more work to do on branch C, (i.e. I git checkout C) wouldn't it apply changes against the commit that I'm trying to move?  I guess what I'm trying to do is move the entire C branch so that its parent is B-HEAD instead of A-HEAD (even though they are currently the same commit).  Or does it even
[21:57:34] <flmbray> matter?  I guess as long as the changes I've made to the C branch commit get applied to B, that's what matters.  (Sorry, I'm new to git ideas, coming from a TFS background...  maybe I've overthinking the branch management)
[21:57:59] <junon> rawtaz: C is a commit in this context. A is a branch.
[21:58:11] <rawtaz> oh ok. just checking :-)
[21:58:16] <junon> fimbray: > C branch
[21:58:30] <junon> C is not a branch as you've defined it, now I'm confused haha
[21:58:32] <flmbray> I did mean that C was a branch, with only one commit
[21:58:43] <junon> I thought that was A.
[21:58:56] <junon> Or, sorry, B.

[22:03:44] <junon> Remember that a commit is just a snapshot of a tree. Unless it's the very first commit (an "orphan" in Git-speak), a commit has a parent commit by which it is based off.
[22:03:58] <junon> A branch (and similarly, tags) is just a "bookmark" to a specific commit.
[22:04:30] <junon> The difference is that a tag isn't meant to be updated, whereas the Git commands surrounding branches also update that bookmark to the newest commits (usually, at least. There are all sorts of things you can do with them, but that's the basic premise).
[22:05:15] <junon> Commits don't have to live on any branch or a tag, though that usually means they're unreferenced and are subject to be cleaned up if you run `git gc`.
[22:05:42] <junon> And when looking at commits, you generally care about how they changed relative to the commit they're based off of - hence why we often see diffs when working with commits.
[22:06:16] <junon> Branches and tags are collectively called "refs" (references) by the way, which is a term you see frequently.
[22:07:01] <junon> A remote (e.g. "origin") is just another place you can mirror a repository to, either in part or full. They can be another server (generally communication happens over SSH or HTTPS), or even another path on the same machine.
[22:07:19] <junon> They can exist independently, or
[22:07:40] <junon> (oops sorry hit enter) or they can have some separate stuff, depending on who pushes what where.
[22:08:34] <junon> Usually when you clone, you only clone one branch (the default branch is the most common case - either `master` or `main`). This makes git pull the HEAD commit (the commit the branch currently points to), and all of its ancestors, to your local copy of the repository.
[22:09:06] <junon> A clone (as well as a pull) will update your local refs (branchs/tags) for whatever it is you cloned/pulled, so that you have the same ref as the remote.
[22:10:06] <junon> Git will also update "remote refs" (not sure the proper term actually) - so if you have branch `foo` referring to your local branch, you might also have `origin/foo` which refers to the last known HEAD of the remote "origin"'s foo branch.
[22:10:29] *** Joins: Thanatermesis (~Thanaterm@191.92.148.122)
[22:10:34] <junon> `git pull origin foo` usually updates both your local `foo` as well as `origin/foo`; `git fetch origin foo` will usually just update `origin/foo`.
[22:11:13] <junon> That's the basic theory behind Git. Not sure how much that helps. All commands that you usually work with just manage creating commits, updating refs, and synchronizing them with the remotes.
[22:11:53] <junon> So two branches that "point" to the same commit don't actually create any objects in the Git repository - they're just two refs that point to the same commit. Nothing more. No commits are added or copied.

[22:12:39] <flmbray> yeah I think it's that concept of branches being pointers that is messing me up a bit...
[22:12:39] <junon> Hopefully that clarifies something :) It seemed there was a confusion of a commit vs a branch to some degree ^^
[22:13:29] <flmbray> so when I create a new branch C that is based on A, it's not based on A per-se, it's based on the commit that was A's HEAD at the time?
[22:13:38] <ikke> yes
[22:13:46] <flmbray> i.e. its based on the commit, not the branch itself

[22:14:40] <ikke> I mean
[22:14:52] <flmbray> and if I add a commit on branch C, it would point to the same "parent commit" regardless of whether I created branch C "based on branch A" vs "based on branch B"
[22:15:15] <junon> Yep :) Commits have no knowledge of branches, only their parent commits.
[22:15:50] <junon> A lot of Git commands are actually many commands under the hood (in fact you can execute the lower level commands manually if you wanted to, there's just not a lot of reason to).
[22:16:44] <flmbray> so it would be completely irrelevant and unnecessary for me to try to move branch C, with its one commit, "from branch A to branch B" since branch A and branch B are both currently pointed at the same commit
[22:17:04] <junon> So a `git commit` actually creates a tree object, then creates a commit object from that tree and attaches author information / messages / etc and the parent commit it's based on, and then it hashes that commit data to form the "commit SHA" that you might see, and then updates the current branch's HEAD to be that SHA (which is what you see when you `cat .git/refs/heads/master` like ikke said)

It's all
[22:20:56] <flmbray> about the merge operation, not the branch operation
[22:21:01] <junon> Another way of looking at it: commit histories are just tree-like chains of historical snapshots of a file hierarchy. Branches and tags are just markers for interesting points in that history. They exist "on top" of the histories.

[22:22:42] <junon> First a `git push` makes sure all relevant objects (objects are a superset of all commits/trees/files) are available on the remote (and pushes up any that are missing) then atomically updates the refs on the remote's end to point to the new commit you want it to.
[22:22:53] <junon> A `git pull` does pretty much the same thing, just in reverse.
[22:23:26] <junon> fimbray: Yeah that's more or less correct :)

[22:23:46] <junon> Now that you're mostly there, working with it some more will make it clear - at least, in my experience.
[22:24:43] <flmbray> "it's all about the merge"...   i think my original concern was because I was thinking only about my local repo...  i was thinking that since I *created* C based on A, that it would stay that way when the pull request merge happened...  but since you can select which branch to merge to in the pull request, that's what really matters.
[22:25:08] <junon> Yes
[22:25:25] <junon> and at least on e.g. Github, the strategy for merging can make a difference.
[22:25:47] <flmbray> bottom line - i can continue happily developing on my local C branch as much as I want... just make sure I set the pull request merge correctly.  GOT IT.  thank you so much for helping me work thru it
