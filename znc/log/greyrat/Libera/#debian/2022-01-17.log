[04:24:48] <sney> then either your interfaces are configured some other way (e.g. network-manager) or there is some other failure
[04:25:14] <micdud> would buggy haldling of bonding interface interfere with everything else ?
[04:25:32] <micdud> no other network managers
[04:25:50] <sney> try calling 'ifdown -a' directly and see if you get the same result
[04:25:55] <micdud> just a very  basic install with /etc/network/interfaces , no other modifications
[04:26:13] <micdud> ifdown works on regular interfaces not on bonding
[04:28:21] <sney> right, well the service is calling 'ifdown -a' which affects all interfaces marked auto. so if your bond interfaces are 'auto bond0' or whatever and ifdown can't bring them down, there's your issue

[06:50:52] <pert> junebug: Debian is a non-profit volunteer-driven project with democratically-elected leadership, Ubuntu is made by a company called Canonical as one of their offerings which includes proprietary software

[06:51:52] <zumba_addict> I ran strace on both and msmtp is does sending it. Maybe my recipient address is getting messed up. I'll send it via a different way by putting from and To to a text file
[06:52:02] <junebug> Thanks pert. I'm curious as far as user experience goes is there much difference? Can I easily switch from ubuntu (using it for 5 years now) to debain? Or are there some things that don't work the same? (Wifi for example)
[06:52:21] <junebug> debian* sorry
[06:52:39] <alMalsamo> sney: Hmm well the problem is the error happened once (the application deleted its own local SQLite database) and I reran the application on a new terminal and re-initalized it, logging back in which generated a new SQLite database and now it is running fine, so I don't think running the application again will produce the same effects/errors
[06:52:55] <sney> there are differences, but if you have a decent amount of experience using/debugging ubuntu, it will not take long to adapt to debian.
[06:53:11] <pert> junebug: things would be extremely similar, but your Wi-Fi may not work out-of-the-box if you have a wireless card that requires non-free firmware. The best thing to do—in hindsight—is to make sure you buy hardware that's free software-friendly
[06:53:30] <alMalsamo> I need the output from the virtual terminal tab where it crashed, and I still have it open but there is just a bunch of black space I have to scroll through where the output should be with crash errors
[06:53:33] <sney> alMalsamo: well, then hope it was a one-time thing. crashes that you can't reproduce are not very useful for bug reports anyway
[06:54:07] <junebug> sney, great. Thanks pert. I mostly just use the terminal and emacs but I'm concerned about the wifi. What if I need those proprietary drivers?
[06:54:28] <sney> you probably do, there are only a couple of wifi drivers that don't require firmware, and they're an older standard
[06:54:51] <sney> there is an installer that includes the firmware, or if you have an ethernet connection, you can install the package afterwards. it's a pretty straightforward process.
[06:55:17] <sney> (for instance, if you're using intel wifi, you would install the package firmware-iwlwifi from non-free.)
[06:55:20] <pert> sney: to avoid proprietary firmware, one doesn't need to stay away from *all* firmware: ath9k_htc and carl9170, for example, have had their firmware liberated
[06:55:55] <junebug> sney, awesome. I'm going to install debian on a VM now to check it out
[06:56:17] <sney> pert: yes, atheros is what I was referring to with the couple of drivers that don't require firmware. unless I am mistaken, they only go up to 802.11n.
[06:56:24] <pert> junebug: then that's a real shame if you have a proprietary wireless card. everybody loses when you spend money on hardware that you're unable to control with free software. because of supply and demand, that makes it even harder for everybody else to get free/libre compatible hardeware. but anyway, you could enable the unofficial non-free repository

[06:59:38] <sney> it would be awesome if this were not true, but all of the AR9* stuff is getting harder to find, and again won't provide current wifi speeds

[07:39:48] <viktor01330> hi all. weird problem here. i chanmged a few variables in /etc/default/locale. and now my second keyboard layout doesn't work anymore. running Bullseye & i3.
[07:42:40] <sussudio> so change them back
[07:43:35] <viktor01330> sussudio: hmm, okay, then how do i change the locale settings?
[07:44:21] <sussudio> is this a trick question

[07:46:05] <viktor01330> sussudio: i want to change some locale settings (specifically date and measurements), but that somehow breaks my alternative keyboard layout, so the question is why and how do i work around it?

[07:53:54] <alMalsamo> Okay so I bought a BRAND new ath9k-supported M.2 card (AR9462 Dell 1802) and it is totally failing at authenticating to my WAP2 network, authentications tries 3 times then times out every time, I have tried like 4 or 5 live distros including Debian.  I asked in #linux-wireless and they want me to start a new AP without encryption, so I have a second laptop with Debian and Intel wifi card and I download
[07:53:59] <alMalsamo> the hostapd package and with this I can switch my Intel card on Debian into AP mode so I can try and connect with my laptop with the new M.2 card installed into it and check for errors
[07:54:21] <alMalsamo> But I don't know how to use hostapd to configure an unencrypted AP... can someone point me to a tutorial for this?

[15:21:15] <PerfDave> ZAJDAN1: Is there a reason you're using a script to do this from the command line?
[15:21:35] <PerfDave> You could be using Network Manager or similar to manage OpenVPN connections, or Debian's own networking stuff from /etc/network/interfaces
[15:22:06] <ZAJDAN1> PerfDave: it is headless debian
[15:22:16] <at0m> i moved aside /etc/network/interfaces[.d] today, saves me one minute on boot
[15:23:21] <ZAJDAN1> cFire: https://termbin.com/px62
[15:24:25] <cFire> That looks like you should be allowed to run openvpn with sudo yeah
[15:24:45] <alkavan> hello! I'm having a strange issue building docker images for several debian versions (stretch, buster, bullseye). Failed to fetch http://security.debian.org/debian-security/pool/updates/main/l/linux/linux-libc-dev_4.9.272-2_amd64.deb
[15:25:06] <cFire> Are you doing "sudo sh connectOvpn.sh" or is the line inside the script "sudo /usr/sbin/openvp ... "?
[15:25:26] <ZAJDAN1> cFire: not..I launch it without sudo
[15:25:30] <alkavan> also happens to some other packages. is 'security.debian.org/debian-security' something new? anything changed? my builds works before.
[15:25:34] <PerfDave> ZAJDAN1: Headless Debian can still use those methods I suggested.
[15:25:40] <cFire> You definitely need sudo
[15:25:45] <PerfDave> alkavan: Do an "apt update" beforehand?
[15:25:52] <ZAJDAN1> cFire: ok I will try
[15:25:53] <alkavan> PerfDave: I did
[15:26:06] <cFire> I would try adding the "sudo" inside the script.
[15:26:12] *** Quits: Hiccup (cHoy@user/hiccup) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:26:49] <cFire> Otherwise sudo probably will not allow it (since sh and that script file itself are not in the allowed sudo command list)
[15:27:20] <ZAJDAN1> thank You..with the sudo which I added into bash script it works
[15:27:32] <cFire> Alright, good stuff.
[15:27:56] <alkavan> PerfDave: welll it turns out I needed to run 'update' then 'upgrade' then 'update' again, that fixed it. but that is strange behaior.
[15:28:03] <PerfDave> alkavan: The URL for the security repo changes between releases, so if you're trying to use the same one for 9, 10 and 11 then that probably won't work

It has no content, it just depends on other packages so that you don't have to have a hundred things on an apt-get/aptitude command line.  The version of a metapackage can be misleading -- look at what it depends on instead (see the kde metapackage for an example).

[18:05:33] <abrotman> wr: it's not older or newer .. they're different.  The linux-image-amd64 is a package that will require the newest kernel package available.
[18:06:25] <wr> abrotman, so the numbers don't mean nothing? their different hmmm
[18:06:41] <abrotman> for the metapackage, doesn't mean much .. for the actual kernel package it does

[18:07:58] <wr> abrotman, i know what is a kernel, but a metapackage i'm sure if i really know what it is, so let me use web in case don't wanna refer nothing
[18:08:15] <abrotman> did you read what the bot said above about "metapackage"?

[22:15:34] <johnfg> Hi folks
[22:15:47] <johnfg> I'm just in the process of upgrading to bullseye.
[22:15:52] <amacater_> OK
[22:16:12] <johnfg> Backups almost done except for the output of, " dpkg --get-selections "*" ".

[22:16:56] <johnfg> Should I just name that, e.g., 'dpkg --get-selections "*" > dpkg_select_2022'?
[22:18:02] <greycat> I'd either put a whole date, or buster.
[22:18:24] <johnfg> greycat: So, dpkg_select_buster?
[22:20:20] *** Quits: mtn (~mtn@98.97.127.52) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:22:21] <amacater_> Are you going to re-use the dpkg --get-selections output to reinstall packages?
[22:22:51] <amacater_> If so, I'd call it foofile and then do dpkg --set-selections < foofile
[22:23:14] *** Joins: cybiko123 (~cybiko123@65.254.30.118)
[22:23:20] <amacater_> but if it's just to archive the packages you had under buster, then name it something memorable _and_ put a date.
[22:23:32] <greycat> I think it's just a backup, in case of some unexpected catastrophe.
[22:24:04] <amacater_> Most of your packages will be overwritten by up to date packages anyway.
[22:24:26] <amacater_> apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade ; apt-get dist-upgrade is my preferred way of doing it.
[22:26:03] <johnfg> greycat: exactly.  Just following the Release Notes.
[22:26:26] <johnfg> amacater_: Good idea though.

[22:29:16] <johnfg> Do you usually remove the obsolete pkgs, as recommended?  I also just noticed that I've got a lot of .deb files in /root.
[22:29:40] <greycat> That second comment has nothing to do with the question.
[22:30:40] <johnfg> True, sorry for mixing them up.
[22:31:04] <amacater_> If those are ones that you've installed, yes. apt-get autoremove or the equivalent apt command will finally remove anything that is not used. After you've done the dist upgrade - dont' forget to reboot so that you're using the new kernel etc. before you run autoremove
[22:32:15] <greycat> I never use autoremove; in fact I configure it so that even if it does get triggered by something (*cough* tasksel), it will do nothing.
[22:32:38] *** Joins: Mathisen (mathisen@about/windows/staff/mathisen)
[22:32:40] <greycat> But I do look through the release notes and if there're packages that are specifically called out as "this will become a problem next release", then I take action on those.

[22:34:20] <amacater_> Also, of course, third party or commercial packages are their own problem:
[22:34:23] <johnfg> Do you ever use the aptitude purge '~o' for what it has found as obsolete, or stick with what you specifically find in the Release Notes?
[22:34:25] <amacater_> !frankendebian
[22:34:25] <dpkg> When you get random packages from random repositories, mix multiple releases of Debian, or mix Debian and derived distributions, you have a mess.  There's no way anyone can support this "distribution of Frankenstein" and #debian certainly doesn't want to even try. See https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian and <reinstall>

[22:38:32] <johnfg> E.g., I don't recall at the moment, if the ddev I use is debian installed, but it's not part of the system itself.
