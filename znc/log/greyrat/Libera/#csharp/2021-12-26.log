[02:13:31] <Ameisen> when you pass an array to it, it GC pins it, stores the handle (well, it creates a handle object and stores a reference to it), and stores a pointer-representation of the array.
[02:13:57] <Ameisen> it has significant downsides in that it is Disposable to clean up the pinning (otherwise you have to rely on the finalizer), amongst others.

[22:24:24] <lz_> Suchiman: you can find k80s for ~300 but v100 are 10k, how come
[22:24:40] <Suchiman> lz_: no demand :P ? xD
[22:39:42] <Slade> supply chain stuff is totally jacked
[22:40:38] <DevJohnC> chip shortage + crypto mining demand + plus scalpers = painful tech times
[22:41:08] <bomb> fire robots hire people, problem solved
[22:41:40] <bomb> every human comes with his own meat chip
[22:42:26] <DevJohnC> hey who told you I called it that?
[22:42:39] <bomb> lel
[22:42:43] <Suchiman> just read a news that said that a big factor is substrate manufacturing
[22:42:46] <sonny> if Text is a string does this make sense? `TextBox.Text += '\t';`
[22:43:08] <Suchiman> sonny: yes, although if .Text is a string, then doing "\t" is more efficient than '\t'
[22:44:42] <sonny> thanks, for some reason I thought that would be weird
[22:44:54] <Suchiman> because doing that line, essentially does `TextBox.Text = String.Concat(TextBox.Text, '\t');` which will call the `String.Concat(object, object)` overload, causing the char to be boxed, resulting in an intermediate heap allocation. Doing `TextBox.Text += "\t";` however, turns into `TextBox.Text = String.Concat(TextBox.Text, "\t");` and that calls `String.Concat(string, string)`, avoiding the intermediate allocation

[22:45:47] <sonny> ah
[22:46:28] <sonny> Textbox having a string as the backing type is silly, I will probably replace it with something else and have to translate it into a string

[22:47:52] <sonny> after hacking my way into things I can see that handling keyboard events for winui controls is (needlessly) tricky, but they must have figure it out themselves since they made an editor recently

[22:49:50] <Sora> is there a maintained c# IRC client library somewhere for bots?
[22:50:22] <Sora> https://github.com/IrcDotNet/IrcDotNet is this my best bet?
[22:51:18] <bomb> does it support SASL?

[23:58:21] <sonny> bomb wpf and winui are the same level of difficulty
[23:58:42] <sonny> but my investigation has concluded with them both being undesireable
[23:59:00] <bomb> sonny but a totally different level of beauty, and maintenance needs
[23:59:19] <bomb> fair. what are you going to use?
[23:59:24] <sonny> your right, one might be much more maintenance
