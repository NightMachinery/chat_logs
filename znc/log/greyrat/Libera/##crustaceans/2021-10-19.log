[03:44:15] <drakonis> TIL dhall is named after a planescape torment character
[03:44:31] <bkero> Dhall?
[03:44:41] <drakonis> yes
[03:44:44] <drakonis> dhall the scrivener
[03:44:50] <drakonis> https://torment.fandom.com/wiki/Dhall
[03:44:51] <buttsbot> Dhall | Torment Wiki | Fandom
[03:44:57] <drakonis> this guy
[03:45:06] <drakonis> https://dhall-lang.org/
[03:45:06] <buttsbot> The Dhall configuration language
[03:45:59] <imode> didn't know that existed.
[03:50:25] <bkero> Ah there's also a language.
[03:55:17] <deadk> dhall is horrible
[03:56:56] <indigo> Not to be confused with Dhole, an endangered canid
[03:57:24] <bkero> Man what a good game.
[03:58:56] <drakonis> deadk: do tell
[03:59:48] <deadk> it's horrible because it's far more powerful than a configuration language should be, enough to make its headline claim essentially worthless
[03:59:56] <deadk> it's also just unpleasant to actually do anything in it
[04:00:30] <drakonis> it exists solely because nix is bad and turing complete
[04:00:38] <drakonis> https://haskell.foundation/podcast/ and https://haskell.foundation/podcast/3/transcript/
[04:00:44] <deadk> turing completeness is irrelevant in this instance, imo
[04:00:50] <drakonis> dhall's author talked about it
[04:01:00] <deadk> i'm sure dhall's author thinks dhall is great
[04:01:05] <drakonis> sure does
[04:01:42] <deadk> it's unpleasant to work with largely because you have to do lots of work computers are better at like spelling the type of everything
[04:01:43] <ngoldbaum> i just find the whole idea of needing to configure something with a turing complete language to be a bad time
[04:01:51] <drakonis> lisp everything
[04:01:53] <drakonis> idk
[04:01:55] <deadk> but it's also only barely not turing complete
[04:02:18] <ngoldbaum> configuring emacs is also bad
[04:02:25] <drakonis> scheme everything
[04:02:28] <drakonis> emacs is emacs lisp
[04:02:31] <deadk> in particular it claims it's an advantage that you can tell two dhall configurations are identical, and that is true
[04:02:35] <drakonis> which is a pretty crap lisp
[04:02:38] <deadk> but you can't tell if two dhall functions are identical
[04:02:54] <deadk> which is the property that would actually be worth something
[04:02:59] <drakonis> i wonder how dead nix would be if nix lang was haskell based
[04:03:44] <drakonis> rather, if it didnt use a bespoke language and just used haskell
[04:04:57] <drakonis> ngoldbaum: elisp is bad
[04:05:13] <drakonis> scheme's simple
[04:05:39] <ngoldbaum> one of these days i’ll go through sicp in scheme
[04:07:16] <drakonis> the best lisp is scheme
[04:07:58] <drakonis> clisp is fine but its incredibly complex
[04:08:10] <drakonis> rather
[04:08:17] <drakonis> it tacks on a lot of things on top of lisp
[04:27:09] <companion_cube> deadk: also a property that is quickly undecidable
[04:27:25] <deadk> that is the price of power
[04:28:20] <companion_cube> same hash (modulo renaming) is a stricter, easier version of that
[04:28:50] <deadk> yeah, but also not very useful
[04:29:07] <deadk> it would be fine to just accept the limitation and move on. but i think dhall makes out like not being turing-complete makes it easier to reason about
[04:29:22] <companion_cube> well it means you can reduce your configuration to a value
[04:29:27] <companion_cube> that's at least something
[04:30:00] <deadk> you get that with any deterministic thing
[04:30:13] <companion_cube> no, a lua configuration won't do that, for example
[04:30:16] <companion_cube> it might diverge.
[04:30:24] <deadk> because it's not deterministic
[04:30:33] <companion_cube> diverging can be deterministic
[04:30:36] <deadk> nix is turing complete, but you can still reduce it to a value, i believe
[04:30:44] <companion_cube> impossible :D
[04:30:54] <companion_cube> turing complete means some programs don't terminate
[04:31:05] <deadk> that isn't really relevant to anything in practice
[04:31:09] <companion_cube> you can express unbounded loops and all that
[04:31:37] <deadk> sure, sometimes you won't get a value where dhall would have given you an error
[04:32:17] <companion_cube> there's value in reliably  giving you an error, yes
[04:32:25] <deadk> i disagree
[04:32:27] <companion_cube> idk if dhall has even any form of recursion
[04:32:37] <companion_cube> if not, it means reduction is also fast
[04:32:42] <deadk> totality is a useful property of languages with theorem proving features
[04:33:08] <companion_cube> well
[04:33:11] <deadk> but i don't think it's a useful property of configuration languages. you almost certainly don't care that your config can fail to compile by looping infinitely
[04:33:19] <companion_cube> look at starlark, it's also useful for configuring bazel it seems
[04:33:24] <deadk> in principle it is an issue, but it's trivial to avoid it
[04:34:03] <deadk> i don't know if starlark is total
[04:34:25] <deadk> but i'n not claiming that being total is bad, i just don't think it's an advantage

[06:02:46] <dimadima> gwozniak: do you find any other chats even operable?
[06:03:02] <dimadima> maybe you have a work slack or something, i guess you don't have a choice with that. but otherwise
[06:03:30] <dimadima> the discords i looked at made me want to run and hide

[06:03:45] <gwozniak> I'm reading this "Compromised" story that gerikson linked earlier and it's pretty stunning to think that this is what you would want money to be like

[06:17:44] <dimadima> not
[06:18:00] <dimadima> and web3 was... well... this stuff
[06:18:32] <dimadima> if i come across it again i'll post it, it was amazing
[06:19:18] <dimadima> oh well here we go i guess they just copied/extended from ethereum.org
[06:19:20] <dimadima> https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/
[06:19:49] <gwozniak> The sad thing is we'll have to fight against this web3 nonsense instead of just letting it fail for the obvious stupidity that it is
[06:19:58] <dimadima> i guess they redefine "web2" - "Web2 refers to the version of the internet most of us know today. An internet dominated by companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data."
[06:20:32] <dimadima> gwozniak: why will we have to fight it
[06:22:39] <gwozniak> Because enough people will believe it to try and actually implement it

[08:57:33] <dimadima> what control structures are there
[08:57:37] <dimadima> beyond, you know
[08:57:40] <dimadima> the usual ones
[08:58:12] <imode> not much apart from basic looping and `if`, which is dependent on basic looping.
[08:58:39] <dimadima> isn't "if" evil?
[08:58:57] <imode> conditional selection is the only way to get stuff done.
[08:59:08] <dimadima> :)
[08:59:19] <dimadima> the pragmatic programmer
[08:59:29] <imode> literally. the core language has no arithmetic operations.
[09:00:18] <imode> you can enqueue a zero, you can enqueue a 1, you can shift the queue left, you can shift the queue right, you can loop until the top of the queue is zero, and that's it.
[09:00:28] <imode> you can build everything useful from that.
[09:01:22] <imode> I never got the idea that "if" is evil. yes, it's interesting and sometimes beneficial to think about how you could make a particular span of code branchless.
[09:01:38] <imode> and excessive conditionals are bad.
[09:01:42] <dimadima> i think cause
[09:01:50] <dimadima> you can turn it into a function call
[09:01:59] <dimadima> you know
[09:03:14] <imode> turn what into a function call?

[09:04:54] <buttsbot> programming languages - Why is the 'if' statement considered evil? - Stack Overflow
[09:05:46] <dimadima> " would suggest taking the claim as a bit hyperbolic."
[09:06:45] <imode> yeah that about sums up my thoughts on it.
[09:06:55] <imode> you can't avoid conditional selection, it's one of the things that you need to do.
[09:07:18] <dimadima> yeah i think that's how computers work, but you know that much better than me
[09:07:30] <imode> like, branching is present in pretty much every automata class.
[09:07:41] <imode> because the foundation of automata is... branching on input.
[09:07:45] <imode> a basic FSM is nothing _but_ branches.
[09:08:11] <dimadima> have you ever fucked with statecharts
[09:08:17] <dimadima> figuratively
[09:08:29] <imode> at one time, yeah!
[09:08:53] <dimadima> just asking cause you mentioned FSMs and of all abstractions i love state machines
[09:08:59] <dimadima> specifically, i guess, statecharts
[09:09:26] <imode> in fact let me spin you a yarn. when I was working at that discord competitor, I wanted a way to easily prototype some stateful parts of our codebase to do with room and user states.
[09:09:26] <buttsbot> 1/3rd of the worlds bandwidth is Netflix. The rest is re-downloading node_modules
[09:09:55] <dimadima> lol what triggered that
[09:09:58] <imode> yarn
[09:09:58] <buttsbot> This fixes all your problems: rm -rf node_modules && npm install
[09:10:02] <imode> lmao.
[09:10:02] <dimadima> hahahaah
[09:10:14] <imode> we had a lucidchart subscription for the whole company, and you can tag lucidchart diagram components with... well, tags.
[09:10:27] <imode> you can also export these diagrams and examine their connectedness.
[09:10:31] <imode> i.e what things point to what.
[09:10:32] <dimadima> jeez
[09:10:48] <imode> so I built a small FSM-diagram-to-Go compiler.
[09:10:49] <dimadima> is that cool
[09:10:57] <dimadima> hah sweetness
[09:10:59] <dimadima> that's cool
[09:11:03] <imode> yeah, it was hella neat. executable documentation.
[09:11:26] <imode> save the doc, a hook ran, the doc was compiled and run. you could visually author unit tests by providing some input in a set of tagged boxes.
[09:11:40] <dimadima> yeah
[09:11:42] <dimadima> that's awesome
[09:11:42] <imode> so some basic user session stuff could be tested without actually writing much code.
[09:11:51] <imode> ikr. executible specs rock.
[09:11:54] <dimadima> the compiler had to be tested though :)
[09:12:23] <imode> truuuuue but it didn't do much.
[09:12:40] <dimadima> i had a lot of trouble writing my editor because there were so many states involved
[09:12:55] <imode> was it modal in nature?
[09:12:58] <dimadima> async persists while editing with errors and inline embeds and all that shit
[09:13:12] <dimadima> i never got it
[09:13:20] <dimadima> and i kept being like "this needs to be a state machine"
[09:13:31] <dimadima> but i just never did it cause i just wanted to program it
[09:13:41] <dimadima> finally i freaked out and started looking for state machine libraries
[09:14:05] <dimadima> after trying to write one myself but failing at that too cause i don't have any experience in that sort of thing
[09:14:10] <dimadima> finally i found https://github.com/statelyai/xstate
[09:14:11] <buttsbot> GitHub - statelyai/xstate: State machines and statecharts for the modern web.
[09:14:16] <imode> oh sick.
[09:14:18] <dimadima> which is sick
[09:14:54] <dimadima> so you specify all your shit as a state machine, without code
[09:14:59] <dimadima> then you can plug the code in
[09:15:03] <dimadima> then it can draw you diagrams
[09:15:12] <dimadima> not the opposite as you did
[09:15:35] <imode> that's still really useful.
[09:15:47] <imode> sometimes we don't understand our code until it's represented in a different way.
[09:15:57] <dimadima> https://stately.ai/viz
[09:15:59] <buttsbot> XState Visualizer
[09:16:08] <dimadima> i would have never finished
[09:16:45] <dimadima> this thing took the most complicated thing in my UI, the one i'd never truly be comfortable that it actually worked
[09:16:51] <dimadima> and just totally liberated it from complexity
[09:16:59] <dimadima> while allowing it to be arbirarily complex
[09:17:02] <dimadima> arbitrarily
[09:17:09] <dimadima> it was a crazy experience
[09:17:39] <imode> isn't it awesome, though.
[09:17:53] <dimadima> literally
[09:17:55] <imode> you just apply a certain model of a problem over your stuff and it magically snaps into place.
[09:18:26] <dimadima> https://i.imgur.com/aMQBszv.png
[09:18:34] <dimadima> yeah
[09:18:41] <dimadima> it wasn't quite magical, but it was close
[09:18:47] <dimadima> the system was still pretty complex
[09:19:13] <dimadima> what was magical was the fact that it took the complexity and LOG N'd it
[09:19:17] <dimadima> that's how it felt in my head
[09:19:50] <dimadima> the viz is cute too
[09:20:26] <imode> eyyy that's a neat visual.
[09:20:28] <dimadima> i guess https://github.com/davidkpiano is trying to make a company around it
[09:20:29] <buttsbot> davidkpiano (David Khourshid) · GitHub
[09:20:37] <imode> looks like a railroad diagram!
[09:20:43] <dimadima> it is hahaha
[09:20:50] <dimadima> my state machine is non-visualizable though
[09:20:55] <dimadima> cause it's pathetically huge
[09:20:56] <imode>  that's lit.
[09:21:32] <dimadima> but i decided that i'd have more discrete states than fewer states and more branch/checks
[09:21:46] <dimadima> the discrete transitions w/o branching is what kills it for me
[09:21:59] <dimadima> if that makes sense
[09:22:09] <dimadima> "kills it" in a positive sense
[09:22:21] <dimadima> so i have a large machine but it's simple as fuck
[09:22:54] <imode> nested machines are good but that's about as far as you wanna go with the concept.
[09:23:01] <dimadima> i didn't get that far
[09:23:03] <dimadima> they support actors too
[09:23:09] <dimadima> i'd want to explore both of those
[09:23:32] <dimadima> i have parallel machines cause without that i'd get state explosion; but only where the state would expode
[09:24:43] <dimadima> <end ode to state machines/xstate>
[09:24:52] <dimadima> branching talk got me thinking about that
[09:25:39] <dimadima> (i guess within my parallel machines i do have nested machines, but it's not too deep)
[09:25:50] <imode> right, it's one level deep and they execute asynchronously.
[09:25:58] <dimadima> yeah
[09:26:12] <dimadima> it's to model saving the document while attachments also upload
[09:26:23] <dimadima> or the user wants to close the document while the above two things are also happening
[09:26:38] <dimadima> there are endless insane possibilities like that
[09:26:49] <dimadima> and before this shit there was no way i could have possibly modeled them
[09:28:19] <imode> what you might find interesting is the different things you can add to an FSM to allow it to compute different kinds of things.
[09:28:30] <imode> all automata in automata theory are just FSMs + some storage.
[09:28:52] <dimadima> i'm sure i will find that interesting
[09:30:10] <imode> you can attach stacks, counters, queues, dequeues, tapes, go-like channels...
[09:30:39] <imode> and depending on the storage you attach, you can compute different classes of things.
[09:30:57] <imode> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy
[09:30:58] <buttsbot> Chomsky hierarchy - Wikipedia
[09:31:07] <dimadima> that's sounds like an actor?
[09:31:12] <dimadima> state machine + state?
[09:31:17] <imode> carl hewitt is a crank, don't listen to him.
[09:31:32] <imode> actors lack any form of model.
[09:31:41] <imode> so they can just be whatever you want.
[09:31:49] <dimadima> ah
[09:31:53] <dimadima> so like OOP
[09:32:11] <imode> a turing machine, for example, is just an FSM with a tape attached to it.
[09:32:19] <imode> you can move the read/write head on the tape forward and backward.
[09:32:26] <imode> write symbols to cells on the tape.
[09:32:52] <imode> and transitions between states in the FSM are based on what the tape head is looking at.
[09:35:16] <dimadima> would love to get into the math of it all
[09:36:25] <imode> turing's OG paper is must-read/
[09:36:27] <imode> *.
[09:36:38] <dimadima> i'm sure
[09:36:50] <dimadima> unrelated but you know what OG paper/monograph is a must-read
[09:36:59] <dimadima> origin of species
[09:37:02] <dimadima> darwin
[09:37:08] <dimadima> (i really meant unrelated)
[09:37:42] <dimadima> i read that like 10 years ago and been thinking about it awesomeness lately
[09:38:16] <imode> darwin was lit.
[09:38:17] <dimadima> is turing's paper understandable
[09:38:24] <imode> yep.
[09:38:24] <dimadima> darwin was totally lit

[15:30:49] <prussian> my brother wants to be a trucker.
[15:30:54] <gerikson> good for him
[15:31:12] <prussian> Not sure what the future would be though.
[15:31:28] <gerikson> companies here are experimenting with flexible work schedules so drivers who are divorced (or not) can spend more time at home every other week
[15:31:44] <prussian> I know a lot of these truckers do other jobs, like home construction on the side too.
[15:31:45] <gerikson> automation is a MASSIVE investment
[15:31:50] <gerikson> mmm
[15:32:00] <gerikson> yeah it's already quite low-margin
[15:32:25] <prussian> well, automation I don't think is a big threat to trucking.
[15:32:36] <gerikson> but having the skills when you are young will open up more opportunities, like jumping in for gigs, workign seasonally etc
[15:32:37] <prussian> other than the obvious kinds, like automatic transmissions and what not.
[15:32:53] <gerikson> prussian: I dunno, not looked into the economics a lot
[15:33:07] <gerikson> I do believe a lot of haulers are driver-owners
[15:33:46] <gerikson> to maintain an automated fleet would require the company to own the vehicls, be responsible for maintenance, and ofc, insurance
[15:33:53] <prussian> true.
[15:34:02] <gerikson> it has to be hell of a lot more efficient to eliminate a human driver
[15:34:22] <prussian> there was a whole rambling pre-corona of driver-owners trying to get hired as actual employees

[18:11:23] <prussian> ya
[18:11:25] <prussian> basically
[18:11:39] <companion_cube> so you bet that BTC will increase so you buy at a large profit
[18:16:39] <gerikson> the futures trading has been going on for a few years

[19:23:15] <gwozniak> Oh nice. The investigation I'm doing for a potential code size optimization seems to be bearing fruit.
[19:23:15] <gwozniak>  
[19:23:53] <gwozniak> I manually analyzed another project and found it could be reduced by about 3% with what I'm thinking of
[19:24:24] <gwozniak> Time to automate this and do it on many more projects
[19:26:11] <gwozniak> Annoyingly, the projects I'm using have duplicates all the startup code so I have patch a lot of files. Boo.
[19:27:08] <indigo> Nice dude! Got some clear metrics to put in your performance review for promo
[19:27:26] <indigo> Jkjk

[21:59:47] <gerikson> are there other 3 letter languages than Zig, Nim and Elm?
[21:59:51] <gerikson> C++ doesn't count
[21:59:59] <gerikson> Lua
[22:00:52] <gerikson> Ada
[22:00:56] <gerikson> ok found a list
[22:01:00] <klardotsh> ada, coq, awk, maybe sed if you want to count that
[22:01:18] <gerikson> ok this is just to unweidly for my cheeky gemlog post
[22:03:18] <gerikson> APL
[22:03:24] <gerikson> Arc lol
[22:05:46] <ngoldbaum> is go the only two letter lang?
[22:06:35] <imode> probably!
[22:07:11] <prussian> gerikson: no....
[22:07:14] <prussian> those are all of them
[22:10:42] <ngoldbaum> time for someone to make tolang
[22:10:56] <ngoldbaum> even ungoogleablier
[22:11:33] <companion_cube> Fu
[22:11:36] <companion_cube> (lang)
[22:11:45] <ngoldbaum> fuuuuuuuu
[22:12:11] <imode> goolang.
[22:12:23] <gwozniak> meme
[22:15:08] <companion_cube> maybe I should make a compile-to-cobol language called "ohno"
[22:15:11] <companion_cube> nvim foo.ohno
[22:15:16] <companion_cube> it has a nice ring to it.
[22:17:24] <ngoldbaum> ono means good to eat in hawaiian
[22:17:28] <ngoldbaum> three letters too
[22:17:35] <ngoldbaum> pronounced like oh no
[22:17:47] <gerikson> Perl == controversial https://gerikson.com/hnlo/#qbcc6m_l8xxhq
[22:17:47] <buttsbot> HN&&LO recent links
[22:20:09] <imode> oh wow.
[22:24:01] <dimadima> gerikson: how do you measure that
[22:30:25] <gerikson> comments/score >= 1.25
[22:31:23] <dimadima> ahh
[22:33:28] <dimadima> my child is teething
[22:34:49] <dimadima> has teethed before but this time he's pretty crazy
[22:36:30] <dimadima> what client was ThrashAbaddon usings that he expected code formatting
[22:36:39] <companion_cube> How old dimadima?
[22:37:01] <dimadima> 1.5 years
[22:37:18] <imode> dimadima: it looks like discord's syntax for pasting code snippets.
[22:37:22] <companion_cube> Oh man they still teethe? I mean, it makes sense...
[22:37:39] <companion_cube> That's 7 months from now for mine...
[22:37:52] <imode> y'all havin kids, damn.
[22:38:08] <dimadima> mine didn't have teeth until he was 9 months old
[22:38:24] <dimadima> looked pretty ridiculous with just gums
[22:38:39] <dimadima> imode yeah it's kind of embarassing/wrong
[22:38:47] <imode> nah nah.
[22:38:50] <imode> not like that.
[22:38:54] <dimadima> if i was a good person i'd be depopulating the eath
[22:38:56] <dimadima> earth
[22:39:09] <imode> meh it'll be depopulated eventually.
[22:39:13] <imode> that's kind of the larger issue.
[22:39:32] <dimadima> imode: only cause we didn't depopulate it sooner
[22:40:22] <dimadima> there should be a ##children channel on libera or something
[22:40:26] <dimadima> like those facebook groups
[22:40:32] <imode> I don't wanna raise kids with possible avoidable genetic deformities only to have them go through the oncoming insanity.
[22:40:45] <dimadima> my wife and i got screened
[22:40:59] <dimadima> for the autosomal recessive stuff
[22:41:12] <dimadima> insanity you can't screen for
[22:41:29] <imode> global climate catastropheeeee.
[22:41:46] <Brekkjern> dimadima: I know you mean well, but I'd bet 50 bucks that any ##children channel on an IRC network would become an absolute shitshow
[22:41:46] <dimadima> sucks we're the only species that wrecks the planet
[22:42:01] <imode> parasites, we are.
[22:42:13] <dimadima> Brekkjern: /topic this is a chan to talk about your childen, not for acting like children
[22:42:34] <imode> you underestimate the amount of weirdos on IRC.
[22:42:39] <dimadima> Brekkjern: although i was jk you know :)
[22:42:52] <Brekkjern> I just don't have any faith in humanity...
[22:43:06] <dimadima> yeah those FB groups are shitshows
[22:43:14] <Brekkjern> I'd wager there would be at least one dipshit coming in there baiting to get CP every week...
[22:43:26] <dimadima> moderators have nervous breakdowns and people flame constantyl
[22:43:32] <dimadima> oh jesus
[22:43:37] <imode> I feel like "faith in humanity" is such an overused thing. like faith is blind trust, I don't have empirical trust in people.
[22:45:22] <dimadima> imode: i'm not understanding the connetion between those two sentences
[22:45:54] <dimadima> and fwiw, i had this "relevation" of sorts about faith over the last few years; it doesn't have to "blind trust", but maybe more of a developed thing
[22:46:13] <dimadima> but like grimes, i don't understand it enough to explain it yet
[22:46:35] <imode> dimadima: people always talk about how they lost/gained "faith in humanity", when I don't have any empirical trust in people to gain/lose. like, I can observe that people aren't trustworthy.
[22:47:08] <skyl4rk> we're the only species wrecking the planet, because we're the only species that has become dominant enough to be able to, not that that makes it much better
[22:47:35] <dimadima> skyl4rk: you could chicken/egg that take though
[22:47:54] <dimadima> imode: i see. i'd love to engage you on that but sadly i should work :(
[22:48:11] <dimadima> little i enjoy more than "human nature"-talk
[22:48:46] <dimadima> skyl4rk: like, maybe we became dominant because we're able to wreck the planet? or something like that?
[22:48:58] <dimadima> but ok, bbl
[22:49:03] <companion_cube> dimadima: ahah the bare gums are funny :)
[22:49:13] <companion_cube> funnier than the biting monster you get afterwards :D
[22:50:11] <imode> they crave human flesh

[22:51:01] <dimadima> companion_cube: i'm not looking forward :/
[22:53:07] <companion_cube> oh I mean, before 1 even
[22:53:13] <companion_cube> you're the one in the future, not me
[23:00:16] <Xe> i guess i'm married now
[23:00:36] <Geekingfrog> woooo
[23:00:37] <skyl4rk> how can you tell?
[23:01:14] <Geekingfrog> 🪅 (TIL, there's a pinata emoji now, categorised as party)
[23:05:22] <companion_cube> congratulations Xe
[23:06:06] <imode> well I got lucky today.
[23:06:10] <imode> and I feel kinda bad.
[23:06:44] <companion_cube> as in, you engaged into non-amazon-related commerce?
[23:06:51] <imode> building had its signs swapped my delivery driver dropped my lunch at the wrong place.
[23:07:15] <imode> I was like "okay, it didn't get here, contact the driver".
[23:07:20] <imode> driver wouldn't respond, contact grubhub.
[23:07:26] <imode> they're skittish so they're like "HERE'S A FULL REFUND".
[23:07:40] <imode> I'm like "okay, there's no way this is that complicated". I walk over to the next building and pick up my shit.
[23:08:26] <imode> so I got lunch for free. I always feel bad when this happens.
[23:09:06] <companion_cube> ah, well, it's just lunch :)
[23:09:06] <skyl4rk> belaying me being a smartass for a while, congrats Xe
[23:09:26] <Xe> skyl4rk: there's this ring on my hand that makes typing weird
[23:09:26] <imode> I wonder if grubhub eats that cost (probably not) or just doesn't pay the restaurant.
[23:09:48] <imode> Xe: congraaaatz, hope your celebration goes/went well!
[23:09:53] <companion_cube> Xe: should have gone for the neck rings
