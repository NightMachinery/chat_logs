[11:53:34] <bullgard4> example sentence in Linguee: "We use the machines in accordance with the standard operating procedure." <-- Is this an often used parlance and acceptable usage in American industry?
[11:58:31] <twb> bullgard4: which industry?
[12:01:04] <bullgard4> twb, software developing and using industry
[12:01:44] <ln> do they use machines?
[12:01:50] <twb> ln: not any more
[12:02:01] <twb> ln: except in specious patent applications.
[12:03:39] <twb> USA still considers software to be a machine, like a lever, rather than mathematics, like an algorithm.  So when you patent something like menus or hamming correction, you present the USPTO with a fake physical device that implements the software in hardware.
[12:05:19] <twb> bullgard4: usually I would expect "we conform to RFC 952", or for security "we meet relevant Common Criteria" or for religious cults "we use agile methods"
[12:06:03] <twb> bullgard4: if you want to sound good while not actually being accountable at all, you can say "we follow best current practice"

And I can identify myself with their use. - In the mean time I found the article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_operating_procedure .

[13:37:41] <blkshp> MuchoLoco: it basically means that if you can accept the person and deal with their  'behaviour' in their worst moments, you can deal with them anytime
[13:37:50] <blkshp> But it's a little context dependent.
[13:40:13] <twb> It's half a quote, innit?
[13:40:37] <twb> "If you CAN'T handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best."
[13:41:43] <twb> Like, if someone was a bag of jelly beans, you're not allowed to only eat the red ones and leave the rest
[13:42:25] <blkshp> It's taken from that quote i guess, but means the reverse. Ie say someone wants to get married to someone who has breakdowns, that person has seen them at their worst but still wants to be with them
[13:42:42] <twb> I guess
