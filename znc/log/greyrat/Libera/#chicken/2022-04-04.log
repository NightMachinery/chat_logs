[17:12:14] <wasamasa> as for the related truncation bug, not sure
[17:12:19] <wasamasa> I'd have to verify that's indeed the case
[17:12:50] <s-liao> in the /root/.local/lib/chicken/11 folder, the size of awful-sse.* file is zero.
[17:12:58] <s-liao> Remove those files
[17:13:14] <wasamasa> that should do the trick
[17:15:13] <s-liao> Yes. you are right. After removing those files, the issue has gone.
[17:15:56] * Bunny351 never could figure out why awful needs Intel SSE optimizations... isn't it already balzingly fast?
[17:16:04] <Bunny351> blazingly, even
[17:16:42] <wasamasa> server-side-whatever
[17:16:54] <Bunny351> s-liao: thanks for your patience! You pointed out a genuine flaw in chicken-install

[19:23:10] <wasamasa> Bunny351: I've added two patches to the ticket
[19:23:56] <wasamasa> and I ported the irc egg
[19:24:02] <wasamasa> so C5 vandusen is getting closer
[19:29:55] <Bunny351> nice, thanks.
[19:58:04] <wasamasa> I'm almost done with the vandusen port
[19:58:08] <wasamasa> just one tiny problem
[19:58:51] <wasamasa> given the existence of vandusen.scm (compiles to vandusen.so) and vandusen-cmd.scm (compiles to vandusen-cmd), how do I make vandusen-cmd.scm compile to vandusen?
[19:59:09] <wasamasa> I can use install-name which installs it as vandusen, but it doesn't change the name of the generated binary
[20:06:25] <wasamasa> I noticed something else
[20:06:45] <wasamasa> probably an old hat, but chicken-install just copies new files over into the file system
[20:06:58] <wasamasa> so suppose an egg changed the name of an executable from egg-foo to egg-bar
[20:07:05] <wasamasa> then you'd have both egg-foo and egg-bar on PATH
[20:08:19] <Bunny351> why does install-name not work?
[20:09:11] <Bunny351> it should also only copy the named executable
[20:11:27] <vandusen> [eggs repo (r41254, by felix)] sandbox 1.91: applied bugfixes by wasamasa that added the missing eval-decorator and additional tests (bug originally reported by Shawn Rutledge)
[20:12:12] <vandusen> [eggs] sandbox version 1.91 (for CHICKEN 5) has been released
[20:13:19] <wasamasa> it does work, but it doesn't change the name of the generated executable
[20:13:36] <Bunny351> sorry, I don't understand
[20:14:06] <wasamasa> ok, I'll try again just to make sure it's nothing on my end
[20:14:37] <wasamasa> (program vandusen-cmd (install-name vandusen) (component-dependencies vandusen))
[20:14:52] <wasamasa> this compiles vandusen-cmd.scm to vandusen-cmd and installs vandusen-cmd to vandusen
[20:15:08] <wasamasa> but I'd want it to compile vandusen-cmd.scm to vandusen and install it to vandusen
[20:20:52] <Bunny351> well, it's the name under which it is to be installed, so this looks ok to me
[20:23:01] <wasamasa> alright, it's just a change from how the .setup file behaves
[20:30:30] <wasamasa> wait
[20:30:36] <wasamasa> who do I send the vandusen patches to
[20:30:56] * wasamasa shakes fist at DerGuteMoritz
