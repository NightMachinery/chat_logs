[02:12:12] <rawtaz> try to get laid for once!
[02:12:38] <lantech19446> last time i got laid my wife almost left me
[02:13:16] <rawtaz> haha
[02:13:24] <lantech19446> did you know you're only supposed to do that shit with them once you're married?
[02:13:34] <rawtaz> nope
[02:14:15] <lantech19446> I'm partially kidding but i did cheat on her during a manic episode and it almost blew up our marriage
[02:14:55] <rawtaz> no wonder
[02:16:16] <lantech19446> yea I'm just fortunate she loves me as much as she does and we worked through it we're better than ever now and I'm receiving appropriate treatment so it's very rare for me to even be manic anymore
[02:17:44] <rawtaz> thats good. YOLO

[02:26:40] <rawtaz> exactly
[02:27:13] <rawtaz> i cant really relate, never cheated on someone and cant imagine ever doing it. but i cant speak for what you did, you only do what youre biologically programmed to do anyway

[04:35:44] <slaughter> I spent all day feeling stupid and looking stupider fighting an addition to Github Actions workflows. Setting an output, couldn't get it to read in any way. Turns out the configure-aws-credentials action masks your account ID by default (totally undocumented), and when you have a mask on a value, you can't set outputs that contain that value. Silently failing all day because of an undocumented feature with an undocumented fix

[04:39:04] <rawtaz> what was the fix?
[04:39:22] <lantech19446> that sucks! you are not stupid though man you've helped me with a ton of shit I know you have the brains to do this 
[04:39:48] <rawtaz> let's not excaggerate :-)
[04:40:04] <rawtaz> dangit, theres no C in that word
[04:40:18] <rawtaz> the older i get, the worse my english becomes :(
[04:40:29] <rawtaz> i blame all of you
[04:41:16] <slaughter> Use `mask-aws-account-id: 'false'` parameter in the action
[04:42:16] <slaughter> It's undocumented, but if you search the action's issues you'll find one open issue to document the parameter, and then a newer PR that actually just defaults to not masking because AWS is rolling back their guidance that account IDs are sensitive values
[04:43:00] <rawtaz> ah :)
[04:45:21] <slaughter> lantech19446 I only look stupid because this is my first offical "work on something not onboarding" ticket and across the 3 repos I've added things to (rolling back ECS deployments on E2E test failure) I've had...10 total PRs because I missed a step the first time, then had a typo in one a second time, then tried a couple fixes for this BS more times
[04:45:30] <slaughter> And truly I probably only look stupid to myself
