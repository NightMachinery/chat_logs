[04:50:02] <dodobrain> hi all
[04:55:32] <FunkyBob> hi
[04:56:16] <dodobrain> FunkyBob, or maybe schinckel.. i have a "service" that reads records out of an Events model and "processes" them and updates a different table. I'm doing this in a transaction, but the issue is that i need to read these events again at the end of the transaction
[04:56:27] <dodobrain> and this list of events could be different on my second read
[04:56:59] <dodobrain> so i looked at db isolation levels and "repeatable read" seems to be what i want, except sqlite (what is being used for dev here) doesnt support it
[05:09:12] <FunkyBob> hmm
[05:09:29] <FunkyBob> you need to re-read the events you have? or...?
[05:12:37] <FunkyBob> dodobrain: from within the same transaction you would expect to read the data at its current state; that is, with the changes affected within that transaction
[05:12:42] <FunkyBob> from outside, you should not see them

[05:25:20] *** Joins: bitdex (~bitdex@gateway/tor-sasl/bitdex)
[05:28:36] <dodobrain> FunkyBob, no i need to re-read them before the transaction ends
[05:28:43] <dodobrain> and read a different table as well..
[05:29:20] <dodobrain> this is getting a little messey .. the essential problem i want to solve is that within my transaction i want a rigid fixed view of the events that does not change
[05:29:31] *** Quits: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[05:30:43] <dodobrain> keeping a copy of the records to be processed is nice, but unfortunately i have many functions being invoked within that have their own function invocations and many of these read directly from db

[05:34:10] <DanDare> I create a model with meta 'managed = False' run makemigrations and migrate. Then change the meta to 'True' run makemigrations, creates the _alter migration fine then run migrate. After this the table is not created in the DB. Is this a bug?
[05:36:13] <FunkyBob> that's debatable
[05:36:41] <FunkyBob> by marking it managed=False you've said something else is responsible for creating/altering the table
[05:36:59] <FunkyBob> so it's reasonable for, from then on, django to assume the table was made by external forces
[05:40:32] *** Joins: fortuno51 (~fortuno51@37.120.156.254)
[05:56:02] <DanDare> FunkyBob, nice. Thanks. Yeah it makes sense.
[06:17:46] <dodobrain> FunkyBob, once i retrieve a queryset. if i execute an order_by on it, does it create/update the query and run it on the db?
[06:17:57] <dodobrain> i imagine it does since any kind of sorting or whatever is better done on the db side
[06:19:08] <FunkyBob> order_by creates a new queryset instance
[06:19:29] <FunkyBob> like other querysets, it's lazy, so doesn't evaluate immediately
[06:20:09] <dodobrain> so if i have a need for example to order by 2 different properties (separately to pull out info) i'm not guaranteed to get the same records returning information
[06:20:35] <FunkyBob> as in, the same records with two different orderings?
[06:20:43] <dodobrain> yes
[06:20:54] <FunkyBob> within a transaction, possibly...
[06:21:01] *** Joins: dez (uid92154@user/dez)

[06:21:47] <dodobrain> followed by Events.history.filter(...).order_by('time').first().time
[06:21:50] <FunkyBob> "
[06:21:58] <dodobrain> these 2 will possibly operate on 2 different sets of records
[06:22:03] <FunkyBob> so... sqlite can give you proper isolation, it appears
[06:22:14] *** Quits: PantelicGR (~PantelicG@user/pantelicgr) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:22:21] <dodobrain> i missed the filter() bit on the first query but its there and identical except for the ordering and the filed they fpull out
[06:22:38] <dodobrain> FunkyBob, doesnt django reuse the same connection?
[06:22:47] <FunkyBob> dodobrain: within the one thread, yes
[06:23:01] <FunkyBob> but it's a connection per thread
[06:23:13] <FunkyBob> https://www.sqlite.org/isolation.html
[06:23:18] <FunkyBob> Transactions in SQLite are SERIALIZABLE.
[06:23:23] <FunkyBob> that's a fairly high isolation level
[06:23:39] <dodobrain> ok, so if i am in my transaction and run those 2 queries and between those 2 queries happening someone has actually added a new Event, it wont show up in my second query ?
[06:23:51] <dodobrain> ah serializable is highest level
[06:24:08] <FunkyBob> i'd have to check if it will see externally committed changes
[06:25:36] <dodobrain> by 'externally committed', do you also include things happening in other parts of the web application ?
[06:28:48] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[06:32:18] <FunkyBob> committed on another connection

[06:38:08] <FunkyBob> that's up to you
[06:38:08] <dodobrain> i created a separate process and created a transaction in which i'm paused at a breakpoint so i can execute random bits of code..
[06:38:20] <dodobrain> now in my webapp i cannot add entries because it says the db is locked
[06:38:41] <dodobrain> wait, you're saying this will work even without a transaction ?
[06:38:45] <dodobrain> i dont think so
[06:39:06] <FunkyBob> no, it will only work with a transaction
[06:39:13] <FunkyBob> have you set the journal pragma to WAL ?
[06:40:06] <dodobrain> no..
[06:40:34] <dodobrain> everything is default on the project.. i didnt change aything to do with db settings or specifically setting wal
[06:42:09] <FunkyBob> the default journal mode is historical, and safer in more use cases [e.g on network storage]
[06:42:18] <FunkyBob> but WAL mode is faster, and handles parallelism far better
[06:42:26] <FunkyBob> it _might_ help with this locking issue

[16:21:28] <ras_manny> I ask this because,         form = ContactForm(request.POST); form.is_valid() keeps returning False
[16:22:17] <moldy> ras_manny: look at form.errors

[19:48:09] <LuxuryMode> I'm trying to process a QuerySet. I can see that I have a result set of thousands of objects, but when I never enter the for loop and I don't understand why. Any ideas? https://dpaste.org/eDK3
[19:49:41] <Azelphur> LuxuryMode, Django executes queries lazy, so Renewal.objects.exclude doesn't run until line 2, and then I think Django will run another query on line 3, my guess would be that query is hanging or something, I'd investigate how to show a process list for your db backend, and enable debug logging for Django which will show the queries it is running.
[19:50:29] <LuxuryMode> hmm ok. Doesn't seem to hang though bc this returns immediately and script exits.
[19:51:10] *** Quits: CodenameTim (~CodenameT@154.21.28.215) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:51:33] <Azelphur> Perhaps the process is getting killed for out of RAM, where are you running this?
[19:51:41] <GinFuyou> try running len(qs) and grab a single item from it. Sounds fishy
[19:51:54] <GinFuyou> or take a slice
[19:51:59] <LuxuryMode> oh weird, printing the QuerySet shows `<RenewalQuerySet []>` yet when doing a `count()` on it I get a result. I realize those aren't the same queries
[19:52:38] <LuxuryMode> yeah good call GinFuyou len(qs) prints `0`
[19:53:03] <LuxuryMode> yet `count()` prints `3349`
[19:53:18] <GinFuyou> still sounds strange...
[19:53:30] <GinFuyou> what db backend by the way?
[19:53:31] <Azelphur> Indeed, this hurts my brain
[19:53:36] <LuxuryMode> Postgres
[19:53:50] <LuxuryMode> `django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2`
[19:54:09] <GinFuyou> Yeah, don't expect tricks from postgres
[19:56:19] <LuxuryMode> hmm, I'm stumped.
[19:57:16] <GinFuyou> What happens if you filter() instead? does it get items that you want to exclude correctly?
[19:57:36] <GinFuyou> Also, probably take a look at your SQL

[20:00:39] <LuxuryMode> Yeah I just looked at the SQL and it's generating a query that returns no results. Even though when doing `count()` it returns what I would expect. Here's the query it generated: https://dpaste.org/XzSv
[20:02:31] <LuxuryMode> whereas the count() query it generates works just fine https://dpaste.org/EiN3
[20:03:04] <LuxuryMode> Mind you, what I'm trying to do is delete bad data. There are some renewals with foreign keys to leases that do not exist. I am trying to delete those.
[20:03:18] <LuxuryMode> I wonder if that itself is part of the issue?
[20:03:42] <LuxuryMode> So Django can give me the count just fine because it doesn't need to materialize renewals to do that but once it tries getting renewals with bad FKs to leases, it just fails

I'm using a generic.ListView, and my get_queryset() function takes a request parameter and uses it to create a queryset - but for some values of the parameter it could fail and raise a ValueError.
