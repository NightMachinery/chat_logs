[15:07:32] <pe> On OpenBSD, ftp can download recursively.
[15:08:39] <bkhl> On my Linux installation (default Fedora desktop) ftp isn't even installed. I assume the presumption is that if you want an FTP client, you can get a better one.

[15:09:51] <riv> it would be interesting to know why they don't have this feature
[15:10:11] <pe> Because no one implemented it, duh.
[15:10:20] <pe> Doesn't happen by itself.
[15:10:24] <gthm> gnu ftp encourages mindfulness by having you think about each and every file you would like to download and the structure they should occupy

[17:11:57] <iDrougge> Hey, why not drop all the dashes while you're at it?

[17:18:05] <bkhl> I haven't actually thought about this. Maybe Wayland would allow making a much more faithful replication of the Amiga desktop paradigm than X does …
[17:18:26] <bkhl> But I suspect the "different resolution of separate workspaces on screen at the same time" would still be hard to do with modern monitors.
[17:19:11] <iDrougge> Well, that is rather unnecessary when monitors have a fixed resolution and that resolution is both high and colourful.
[17:19:29] <bkhl> Yeah, you can probably simulate it well enough on HDPI
[17:19:45] <bkhl> I guess it would be effectively different scaling factor per workspace
[17:20:40] <riv> there's also the dd style if=/dev/random
[17:20:43] <bkhl> The main thing though that I miss from Amiga is that the windows can not go outside of the visible area. That just makes so much more sense to me.
[17:20:52] <iDrougge> I've never missed different resolutions per workspace on a modern system. I did miss it on very old Macs since they had to run games with software scaling, slowing them down.
[17:21:36] <iDrougge> bkhl: Good for you that it is permitted to move windows off-screen on newer versions of AmigaOS. ;)
[17:21:37] <bkhl> Yeah, what's done with scaling factor in modern UIs is much more pertinent these days.
[17:21:54] <bkhl> iDrougge, ah, no. I mean I _liked_ that you can not.
[17:22:09] <bkhl> I'm very disappointed to hear they changed it.
[17:22:24] <iDrougge> MacOS adds some resistance when you try to move windows off-screen or on top of each other so it's easier to stack them in a sensible way.
[17:22:50] <iDrougge> bkhl: You can turn it off or allow it only when holding a hotkey.
[17:23:03] <bkhl> Aha.
[17:23:20] <iDrougge> riv: The dd style is actually from JCL, via Multics, I think.
[17:23:37] <iDrougge> I remember feeling something was eerily familiar about JCL when I took a course in COBOL.
[17:24:07] <riv> oh interesting!
[17:24:25] <iDrougge> JCL is absolutely horrible, of course, given its vintage.
[17:24:44] <pe> Thanks for the Amiga link and GNUstep push (NeXTSTEP also has a nice one).
[17:25:03] <pe> My page looks a bit less sad now. :D
[17:25:05] <iDrougge> OTOH, because it was so bad, and never was improved into something not quite as bad but still bad, like Bash, it birthed better scripting systems.
[17:25:33] <riv> well said :P

[17:32:26] <iDrougge> I wonder if the AmigaOS HIG is the only one that also deals with command line interfaces. Can't find it in Microsoft's or Apple's guides.
[17:41:41] <bkhl> Well, in Mac OS X Apple just combined Bash (and later Zsh) and existing BSD tools, so I guess that would then only apply to the ones they added for Mac OS-specific stuff (launchd etc)?

[22:47:06] <pe> So... I managed to mount the 1993 NeXTSTEP developer CD under Linux, as a subtype of UFS, I fixed some invalid Encapsulated PostScript headers with Perl, and then the rtfd directories opened kind of alright in the Pages app on my last year's MBP.

[23:38:06] <mrus> recently saw the GB on deskhero for the Lulu Split, but I wasn't sure whether I really wanted to go down that path. Using solely HHKBs atm and feel like options are already limited enough.. finding keycaps for a split seems like a PITA.
[23:39:03] <pe> Finding keycaps for a low profile mecha IS a pain in the buttocks.
[23:40:22] <mrus> also I believe unless it's something like a Moonlander or a Hatsu sound pretty much sucks with those, no?
