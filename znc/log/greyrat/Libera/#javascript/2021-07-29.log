The prices do have floats so I first regex each line for the price, force its type to float and then do the addition to previousl total sum. However, after a few additions that work fine, the float number suddenly become likes x.yyyyyyyy. What am I missing?  Here's the html with the sample data and included JS:  https://paste.simplylinux.ch/

[11:20:11] <hexeme> hyper_ch: in a javascript console do 0.1 + 0.2
[11:20:25] <hexeme> you'll get a value like 0.30000000000000004
[11:20:34] <hyper_ch> hexeme, well, the first few add correctly
[11:20:48] <Cork> Ya, that is what floating points to, you sould get correct results if you round it to the decimal point you want though
[11:21:06] <hyper_ch> then you have an intermediate sum of 17.9 and add 4.9 and it turns to 22.799999999999997 instead of 22.8
[11:21:16] <hexeme> hyper_ch: that's just what floats do
[11:21:21] <hexeme> it's interesting, you should read about it
[11:21:39] <hyper_ch> why wuld floating points do that?
[11:21:52] <hexeme> it is a pretty deep rabbit hole that can lead you all the way to information theory and metaphysics heh

[11:30:09] <DPA> Basically, for both, int and float, you have n bits, using which you could in theory represent 2^n values. With an int, the values the bits represent are always a fixed amount apart.
[11:30:09] <DPA> But with a float, the values the bits represent aren't distributed evenly. Small values are more precise then larger ones. The total max amount of different possible values is still the same for the same number of bits, though.

[11:37:32] <hyper_ch> thanks for the help :)$
[11:37:55] <Byteflux> nobody actually stores currency as floats in any language
[11:38:42] <tracker1> You can try toFixed() if you want to display N past decimal, or can try +(0.2 + 0.1).toFixed(5) for a similar effect... but it just kind of sucks either way...
[11:38:56] <hyper_ch> ok, thanks

[11:40:08] <tracker1> @Byteflux, agreed... would wrap BigInt at Math.round($CURRENCY * 100000000) or something similar leaving plenty of room after the decimal to prevent lossiness

[17:42:28] <Koopz> is there a channel talking about webdesign in general?
[17:42:55] <entuland> there is #web and #webdev if you want to hop in and check
[17:43:12] <Koopz> hm...
[17:43:14] <entuland> there are a few more channels I'm in where such things are discussed every now and then
[17:45:40] <DnzAtWrk> depends on what you're designing
[17:45:42] <DnzAtWrk> #css can be good
[17:46:26] <Koopz> well it's not really about looks but more about user experience i guess
[17:46:40] <DnzAtWrk> it's getting quite close to the same at this point
[17:46:50] <DnzAtWrk> a large chunk of your app is goind to be done in #css
[17:47:08] <DnzAtWrk> to the point where you can essentially make a mockup of the entire app in css + html
[17:51:09] <entuland> to an extent such kind of discussion can fit in here just fine (the bits that could be affected or solved or whatver via JS, I mean)
[17:52:17] <Koopz> so as a filthy degenerate that happens to be a fulltime developer i've been a member of a subcommunity of an anime tracking website (what did i watch when and how did i rate it?) focusing on watching media that meets specific requirements and forcing people to get out of their comfort zone and watch things they'd usually not. Some of those made-up
[17:52:17] <Koopz> requirements tend to require tedious amounts of opening tabs and manual checking which more or less made me develop the one or the other little website that helps figuring things out.
[17:53:31] <Koopz> my longterm goal is to unify all of the stuff i made into a single website that doesn't look like utter shit

[17:57:12] <Booster2ooo> Any suggestion for an OData query/client library ?
[17:57:33] <Koopz> however i'm not sure how to design the new "V2" in general. One of the good things the users pointed out was that they had quick access to the controls for which columns to display and all the filters they could need
[17:59:13] <Koopz> https://koopz.rocks/awc-tools/ this is basically what i've been experimenting with so far, outsourcing the column visibility configuration into a popup and the filters into a sidebar you can hide with the hamburger menu.
[18:00:06] <Koopz> however with the increased font size and the sidebar layout i'm sacrificing a lot of horizontal space for columns to display
[18:00:54] <Koopz> (Click the Load Button on the upper right corner for full UI)
[18:02:19] <Koopz> which is another thing people liked about the current page. They can see a lot of data at once without horizontal scrolling (which is a major advantage to the tracking site which's API i'm accessing here and the sole reason i wrote this thing in the first place)

[21:38:43] <ljharb> Rockwood_: what aren't you sure about
[21:38:58] <ljharb> gehn: it can emulate things impressively, but it's still very primitive
[21:39:18] <gehn> I still wouldn't call it "very primitive" either
[21:39:25] <Rockwood_> not possible auto code generate by AI
[21:39:58] <ljharb> gehn: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ i do
[21:40:03] <gehn> I think google's new GPT-3 implementation can actually write some simple (albeit trivial) programs when asked to
[21:40:10] <ljharb> Rockwood_: of course it's possible
[21:40:14] <ljharb> Rockwood_: that doesn't mean it's ever a good idea
[21:40:34] <ljharb> it's not actually "intelligence" to train a neural network on a code corpus, and then ask it to produce code
[21:40:36] <Rockwood_> right now we are talking about the way
[21:40:41] <gehn> a sharp stick is primitive. a neural network isn't what I'd call "primitive"
[21:40:45] <ljharb> Rockwood_: no, we were talking about whether it was a good idea
[21:40:57] <Rockwood_> quality assurance is another point
[21:41:04] <ljharb> gehn: i guess it's about "relative to what". the standard for AI is "actual human intelligence", relative to which it is exceedingly primitive
[21:41:17] <ljharb> Rockwood_: the primary point was "should you do it in the first place", and no, you shouldn't
[21:42:06] <Rockwood_> many software using AI now days
[21:42:25] <ljharb> Rockwood_: ok? that's all irrelevant, you still shouldn't autogenerate code.
[21:42:34] <Rockwood_> even in medical way
[21:42:38] <gehn> sure, when you specify a relation there, I agree. AI looks more like a hammer or a sharp stick in comparison to actual human intelligence
[21:42:40] <ljharb> Rockwood_: most software using AI is not using it to generate code. google's copilot is a rare example.
[21:42:53] <ljharb> Rockwood_: "using AI" and "generating code" are not the same thing
[21:43:00] <gehn> without said qualifier though, no linear algebra and calculus isn't what I'd call "primitive"
[21:43:03] <ljharb> Rockwood_: so i'm not sure how you got on this topic; nobody mentioned AI before you did
[21:43:09] <silly> behind every ai success story are people who fixed the results
[21:43:11] <Rockwood_> my point of usage AI
[21:43:12] <ljharb> gehn: agreed but imo the qualifier is implied
[21:43:24] <ljharb> gehn: "primitive" doesn't always mean "caveman-like"
[21:43:42] <ljharb> Rockwood_: no points about AI have any impact on the previous topic, "don't generate code"
[21:44:14] <gehn> if you want code that is unintelligible to humans and therefor effectively unmaintainable, sure, generate code

[21:44:58] <celphi> Interesting problem- how would you solve it? Say you have customers who have wordpress sites. And I as a company want to insert a form on each of those sites. I need to be able to know which server each of those requests came from and validate that only that site could use it. HOw would you do it?
[21:45:19] <ljharb> celphi: you make the form only ever submit directly to the hosting site
[21:45:25] <ljharb> celphi: and you have their wordpress server talk to your backend
[21:45:41] <ljharb> celphi: which should be relatively trivial to encapsulate in a single wordpress plugin
[21:46:18] <Rockwood_> WP means bad dream :D
[21:46:50] <celphi> Ok one final problem
[21:47:10] <celphi> I want to be able to update that form from my company
[21:47:18] <celphi> all of them
[21:47:40] <ljharb> celphi: you could have the plugin load its JS directly from your own site, but that's a bad idea
[21:47:49] <celphi> without having to go to each page and update it
[21:47:53] <ljharb> celphi: as for the server-generated HTML, you can't safely do that without a wordpress plugin update
[21:47:59] <gehn> host it on a CDN or S3 or something, customers include the form on their site
[21:48:02] <ljharb> celphi: so, tldr, nope. you have to update each site one at a time.
[21:48:14] <gehn> ideally via a wordpress plugin so it comes "through" the wordpress backend

[21:48:27] <ljharb> celphi: the only way to do this reasonably is to have a client-javascript-only form, like stripe or disqus. but this is very brittle.
[21:48:39] <ljharb> celphi: it's far better to update every customer manually.
[21:48:48] <ljharb> celphi: especially since wordpress can auto-update plugins
[21:48:51] <celphi> not when theres 100+ of themm
[21:49:15] <celphi> plus the customers are not the brightest to update the forms

[21:50:28] <celphi> so are you saying host the html on a cdn then load that into the wordpress site then use curl to send request?

[21:50:45] *** Quits: Rockwood_ (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Quit: The Time is Over)
[21:52:14] <gehn> celphi, something like that, yes most likely
[21:53:01] <gehn> if you control the form, and you then effectively just "proxy" the entire form's request through the wordpress backend and over to *your* backend, you have full control over everything
[21:53:14] <gehn> don't even need to update the plugin itself in most cases probably, like if you need to make a change
[21:53:34] <gehn> change your form, change your backend to accomodate the new form changes, and you're done
[21:53:44] <gehn> the wordpress side of things then basically works "transparently"
[21:54:22] <gehn> not a perfect solution, but it's close to making you as independent from the customers as possible
[21:55:15] <gehn> the main downside I can think of is if, say, the form and your backend changes radically. for example say you have /my-rest-server/api/v1 and then you create /my-rest-server/api/v2
[21:55:50] <gehn> but you could still account for that more or less by wrapping your payloads like { 'api': 'v2', 'body': { /* actual content */ } }
[21:55:55] <ljharb> celphi: even if there were 10,000 of them
[21:56:11] <ljharb> celphi: it's super hostile to force code changes downstream. let them pull the changes.
[21:56:15] <gehn> so then everything always goes to the same URI, and you can differentiate between payloads easily and change them almost completely as well

[23:42:12] <Donitz> aw
[23:42:16] <Donitz> but I have a large number of scenes

[23:43:08] *** Joins: lilmonkey (~lilmonkey@user/lilmonkey)
[23:44:56] <wroathe> Donitz: I would do the shared case with a switch/case, and the individual cases with an object that maps the string scene to it's numeric ID

[23:45:31] <wroathe> if (shared[scene]) ...
[23:45:52] <wroathe> const sceneId = sceneIds[scene];
[23:46:11] <Donitz> eh, nothing wrong with string ids
[23:46:26] <Donitz> just one step less
[23:46:33] <wroathe> True. I was just going off of what you shared there :P
[23:46:46] <Donitz> I know, I used to create state enums
[23:46:55] <Donitz> but they didn't really serve any purpose
[23:46:56] <Donitz> just busywork
[23:47:16] <Donitz> I mean, not in javascript
[23:47:21] <Donitz> in something like C# they definitely do

[23:49:01] <Donitz> whups, wrong params
[23:49:28] <wroathe> These days I'm starting to feel triggered by the word `this`. It's like it goes against my religion or something.
