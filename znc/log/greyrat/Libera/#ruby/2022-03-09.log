[06:33:59] <newton> water is wet

[06:42:29] <weaksauce> a few core rails maintainers quit
[06:50:42] <nakilon> I wish all the rails maintainers quit, lol; people would finally realise that there is a programming language called ruby so I would get a job
[06:51:43] <nakilon> though maybe it won't change anything and programming would be still about making websites, just with another framework, sigh
[06:52:15] <nakilon> *would be still considered to be only about
[06:54:37] <ox1eef> i don't know what's behind it exactly, looks like a disagreement of some kind.
[06:55:35] <ox1eef> nakilon: as i read on twitter, it's not a matter of just moving to hanami or whatever, rails has its feet dug deep and too many rely on it for it to be that simple.

[07:01:54] <nakilon> new people contact me every day saying that they've got a job for me, and when I say that I don't make websites they assume that I'm idiot with fake resume who's fooling them and half of communications end with "we don't need juniors" or "have you tried to become a programmer?"
[07:02:09] <ox1eef> well, that's not nice. my opinion is from the view that there shouldn't be one choice, and for all practical intents and purposes, thats often the reality. itd be nice to see another framework with different ideas.
[07:02:58] <nakilon> "your portfolio does not have any websites -- do you even know any programming language? even a bit?" -- real question from the 2nd last interview (even 3rd stage of it)
[07:03:29] <ox1eef> well, ruby is most often used as a web language. python has more diverse use cases.

[07:07:02] <nakilon> basically being a rubyist is a label on you, and you could be considered a person only if you make website in rails but I don't that, I'm not interested in'

[12:38:26] <cxl> Hi all, my ruby is a little rusty... What is the best practice regarding classes vs instances? If I have a class that doesn't really need to be instantiated to function (i.e. it's mostly stateless and functional), is it ok to only use class methods and never get an instance of that object? Or should I instantiate everything every time?
[12:39:54] <ox1eef> cxl: when the methods are stateless it's especially fine.
[12:40:30] <cxl> ox1eef: noted, thanks
[12:40:50] <ox1eef> generally stateful class methods cause trouble in multi-threaded environments and usually not recommended in that case.
[12:41:11] <jhass[m]> a class that you never instantiate is a module :)
[12:42:03] <ox1eef> agreed, you may not need a class at all.

[13:14:56] <ox1eef> the former
[13:15:19] <ox1eef> if it has state such as instance variables, you might want to use an instance of a class instead. 
[13:18:57] <ox1eef> the idea is to contain state, when you work with instances who create local references to other objects, you can keep that object local to a thread, and run one-per thread without any issues. it's only one idea, and for your situation maybe that's not something to care about.

[13:56:09] <cxl> How would I write a YARD docstring for this `def myfunc(options)` where options is a hash, keys are symbols, values vary; and I want to specify the keys names because it's basically a params list.

[13:56:43] <cxl> It seems like [Hash<Symbol, String|Numeric>] wouldn't be sufficient to achieve that.

[22:03:52] <mooff> is there a handy way to tell if a module / constant name is already taken by a public gem?
[22:07:59] *** Joins: ___nick___ (~quassel@cpc68286-cdif17-2-0-cust533.5-1.cable.virginm.net)
[22:15:20] <mooff> with a side order of why are all the good gem names taken ðŸ¤“
[22:17:07] <apotheon> mooff: Search for it at rubygems.org, I guess, or using the gem command.
[22:17:37] <apotheon> $ gem search goodgemname
[22:17:54] <apotheon> Oh, module.  Wait.
[22:17:59] <apotheon> forget what I said
[22:18:07] <apotheon> I clearly haven't been awake long enough.
[22:18:14] <mooff> np. i have been checking rubygems.org for gem names
[22:18:41] <apotheon> A module search at rubygems.org would be quite handy.
[22:19:16] <mooff> i think i remember adam's site listing modules
[22:21:03] <mooff> naw, just gem names with some PascalCase
[22:21:17] * mooff brews self and apotheon some coffee
[22:22:38] <apotheon> Thanks.
[22:22:56] <apotheon> I should brew some tea, actually.
[22:23:03] <apotheon> steep
[22:23:04] <apotheon> whatevs
