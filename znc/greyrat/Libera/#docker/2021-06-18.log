[03:21:22] <BtbN> Just let it? I don't see the issue.
[03:22:41] <Lutin> BtbN I'm no sure if it denies the connections because of it
[03:23:08] <BtbN> Seems unlikely
[03:23:28] <Lutin> yeah no sure :)
[03:23:50] <Lutin> I hate those logs tho
[03:25:43] <ilius> I so wish the internal swarm dns would do reverse naming for all of the forward service names.  It'd make it so much easier to what is hitting what in intra-swarm traffic.

[04:25:13] <lilgopher> i want to use a small image line linux alpine to run a go app and I want to use docker compose. But I need for example the timezones. Should I add the timezones for alpine in a dockerfile? or I can do that with just docker compose?
[04:27:14] <BtbN> What do you mean, you need the timezones?
[04:28:32] <cim> lilgopher: apt add tzdata then set TZ in the environment variable to whatever
[04:28:41] <cim> apk** sorry auto correct
[04:29:17] <lilgopher> when I use the parsing function in golang with alpine, the locations(for timezones are not there)
[04:31:01] <cim> maybe use os.Getenv("TZ") ?
[04:32:31] <lilgopher> cim https://github.com/takecy/tz-sample is this the approach you are suggesting?
[04:33:47] <cim> well yeah I just mentioned earlier to apk add tzdata lol
[04:34:15] <lilgopher> I guess I dont know what the line "RUN apk --no-cache add tzdata" is doing, and if I need to add more packages can i use the same apk?
[04:34:58] <cim> yes the package you're missing is tzdata for timezones
[04:36:42] <lilgopher> oh, so run just runs the command in linus and apk is the pckage manager
[04:36:57] <cim> yes for alpine linux, apk is the command for the package manager
[04:37:03] <lilgopher> if I want to add a different dependency i can run whatever command i need I guess
[04:37:08] <cim> yep
[04:37:15] <lilgopher> thanks
[04:37:31] <cim> https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages
[04:39:22] <lilgopher> sorry for the noob question but then: i build the image with a dockerfile first, adding dependencies. But then  if I use docker compose how does it know what image it has to run?
[04:40:25] <lilgopher> I cannot just put alpine:X..X or it will just run the image without my dependencies
[04:40:44] <lilgopher> *image: alpine:X.X
[04:41:04] <cim> the official alpine images don't preinstall a lot of packages
[04:41:38] <cim> that's where you come in and customize it. you can set your environment variable through the Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml
[04:42:49] <lilgopher> what env variable? haha
[04:43:10] <cim> maybe you should read up on the docker documentations lol
[04:43:26] <lilgopher> haha, yeah, I'll try that and come back, sorry
[04:43:48] <cim> no problem

[14:38:23] <gordonjcp> VaniaPy: so what do you think the problem is?
[14:41:25] <VaniaPy> not really sure
[14:41:42] <gordonjcp> well
[14:41:43] <VaniaPy> i'm trying to move the dockerfiles to a Docker folder
[14:41:45] <gordonjcp> there's an error message
[14:41:48] <L0j1k> :)
[14:41:57] <L0j1k> oic
[14:43:11] <L0j1k> your context is the directory where you do the "docker build" command. so when it uploads all the stuff in teh context into your container, and it looks for docker/nginx/nginx.conf (which it says is missing), it needs to be under ${PWD}/docker/nginx/
[14:43:39] <L0j1k> if you don't specify like in a docker compose file
[14:43:45] <L0j1k> or w/e
[14:44:10] <L0j1k> that trips me up sometimes too, tryin to sort which directory it's treating as the build context
[14:46:07] <gordonjcp> VaniaPy: as L0j1k says, docker doesn't think your config files are where you think they are :-)
[14:46:07] <L0j1k> oh i just saw ur paste, missed it for some reason
[14:53:59] <VaniaPy> hmm so the problem is in the nginx's service in compose file

[15:25:25] <Lutin> I never see that happening actually in examples
[15:25:31] <pretoriaJ> Is it possible to limit the network bandwidth (both ingress and egress) of a docker container?
[15:26:23] <pretoriaJ> I'm using Kubernetes locally (using Kind). So it's fine if I can at least limit the network bandwidth at a pod level. 
[15:27:43] <pretoriaJ> What I've tried: In Kubernetes deployment spec, I tried adding an annotation -- "kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth": "10M" but that doesn't seem to do anything. An iperf test still shows up to 15 gbps bandwidth
[15:30:50] <Lutin> pretoriaJ why on ingress/egress level ? If you limit the container itself it should be enough
[15:31:28] <pretoriaJ> I see. 
[15:31:46] <pretoriaJ> Actually I'm quite confused about the networking topology in such a local cluster setting. 
[15:32:04] <pretoriaJ> If I have a cluster of docker containers, how are they connected to each other?
[15:32:56] <pretoriaJ> Meaning, when I send traffic from container A to container B, how is it routed? What are the hops? It's the same system right? So does it go through loop back?

[17:16:28] <ada_> pretoriaJ: there are a few different ways you could model the network topology based on how your containers are deployed

[22:22:00] <sed> i will probably have more questions later in the meantime i will keep reading a few kubernetes books
[22:25:00] <artok> and as always, make drawing of your services that you want to run
[22:25:28] <artok> connections to each other and so on, that helps you to write those deployment yml
[22:27:47] <sed> yea for sure thank you
[22:28:07] <sed> i have a docker compose yml file but i am thinking about converting to kubernetes
[22:30:33] <sed> this channel does not mind if i ask kubernetes questions in here does it? I know there is a kubernetes channel but there are less people

[22:37:17] <artok> admins will tell if they don't like =)
[22:37:52] <artok> is there proper k8s channel? 
[22:38:16] <sed> ok sounds good
[22:38:25] <sed> yes but it is quiet most of the time
[22:44:39] <sed> oh another question - Can you use a yubikey to act as a hardware security module for kubernetes encryption keys? https://www.yubico.com/product/yubihsm-2/
[22:44:58] <sed> or would you just use vault?
[22:53:37] <artok> eh... well..
[22:53:48] <artok> vault, sure

[23:55:10] <artok> duh
[23:55:46] <artok> they need those tokens that you download from DO when you create the cluster
[23:56:29] <artok> DO will revoke those tokens after 3months or so, but you'll be able to get new one
