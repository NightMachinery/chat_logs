[09:20:52] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)

[09:21:21] <B4ckBOne> yes
[09:21:46] <B4ckBOne> the first ip and port is the attackers server and port serving the website and download / socket
[09:21:58] <B4ckBOne> The part after the / is like the an index.html
[09:22:06] <B4ckBOne> just named as your ip and port

[09:24:13] <lum0s> thanks B4ckBOne
[09:24:27] <B4ckBOne> No worries. Lets make this a good place :)
[09:26:01] <ajak> i am good, just trying to make sure it's known that that data doesn't seem to actually have anything to do with the exploit
[09:26:07] <lum0s> there is a brief mention of this exact exploit string on a sans.edu writeup and this is what they have to say, indicating to me that maybe its not entirely understood
[09:26:10] <lum0s> "Including the target IP in the URL may be used to just detect vulnerable systems, or to only deliver the payload if the request originates from the correct IP address."
[09:27:04] <B4ckBOne> good point.

[10:54:04] <simpleton> anyone here think the standard of cybersecurity industry is ridiculous and the fact that actually reputable schools around the western world are teaching CS bachelor holders to be "cybersecurity experts" in 1 semester of courseload?
[10:54:33] <ajak> this premise sounds wrong
[10:54:51] <simpleton> Well, that's the standard for every company that is publicly disclosing what they are doing
[10:54:52] <ajak> who is claiming CS bachelor holders can be "cybersecurity experts" in 1 semester?
[10:55:03] <ajak> .. are we talking about schools or companies?
[10:55:04] <simpleton> Lol, most universities...
[10:55:33] <ajak> yeah, i'm in university and the security PhDs i know would laugh at that idea
[10:55:42] <simpleton> Schools teach the certificate, and companies tend to think they are good schools to trust the grads from, and I know the US army lets those people attempt to pass their tests
[10:55:51] <simpleton> Yeah I think it's ridiculous too
[10:55:56] <ajak> i think everyone does
[10:56:15] <simpleton> but I also think the idea of a CS expert of any level, would be too advanced to bother with university by the time they got in
[10:56:44] <simpleton> I mean if I wasn't programming for almost 2 decades before I could get into CS bachelor... I would be nowhere near as capable as cs PhD grads... and have done the jobs I have done

[11:03:39] <simpleton> I found a bug in Google cloud 2 years ago... where the KVM management tool in their local ubuntu repo mirrors/additional stuff repos, could push a command one line into a bash session that was running the KVM based VM instance, and the shell persisted, and then there was an ancient linux kernel running when I fooled around with metasploit, which was honestly really hard because I generally avoid script kid
[11:03:39] <simpleton> stuff since I have no interest in google found guides on using such tools, but I got the shell to give me root, and I overclocked the ECC RAM in the V100 Tesla GPUs and fried 8 GPUs per server in 3 servers before I sold the paper I wrote and commitment included with it to fix their secuity properly... buffer overflow-shell input but no reading output->root shell->nvidia driver settings options->fried

[11:19:58] <simpleton> two are essential services, one of them is probably the only program that will help people with covid related research(genetics and virology is my side quest, main quest is avian veterinary medicine, and the PhD is in psychology of geniuses and all the mental health issues they have), also after these degrees I am going to get into engineering, of robotics and space technology and MEMS and I probably want to
[11:19:59] <simpleton> get another few degrees in avian medicine because that's my chosen career... before I started working to be a avian vet I had no goals in life other than pointless non useful not profitable hobby tasks, but I finished all those goals over a decade ago...
