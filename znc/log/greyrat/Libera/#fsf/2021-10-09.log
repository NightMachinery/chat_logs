[00:28:18] <leah> craigt: yes, don't add osboot to FSD. it violates the fsf criteria completely. it's a fork of libreboot, but unlike libreboot, osboot permits binary blobs from coreboot. the purpose of osboot is to provide something more free than fully proprietary boot firmware, on as many systems as possible, for those who aren't willing to use libreboot but who do wish to have more freedoms
[00:28:49] <leah> i am the founder of osboot, in addition to libreboot. osboot is an experimental side project. libreboot is my main focus. libreboot is 100% free software and belongs in the FSD, but osboot certainly does not
[00:29:41] <leah> the purpose of both projects is to provide a fully automated build system around coreboot, to produce ROM images that the user can simply flash. in other words, they are both coreboot distributions. but only libreboot complies with FSF criteria
[00:30:40] <leah> osboot is kinda neglected at the moment. my primary focus for the last 6 months has been libreboot. i might abandon osboot entirely, but we'll see
[00:31:13] <leah> i probably won't. i'll probably revive it in some minimal way, just to keep it going, but i haven't maintained it for half a year
[00:31:21] <leah> i'm currently working on a libreboot release

[00:34:04] <leah> osboot actually started as a proof of concept when libreboot was undergoing a rewrite that went stale. i said: i bet i could revive libreboot in 6 months, but i did it in a fork just in case it went wrong. but it was a huge success. but then i got carried away and it became its own thing
[00:35:25] <leah> then i forked osboot to create the libreboot 20210522 release :)

[11:33:17] <Vitali64vitali64> I was very lucky with my poco F1 phone
[11:33:43] <Vitali64vitali64> Back then, I just wanted a fast android phone
[11:34:10] <Vitali64vitali64> And what I got, was a phone that supports 5 whole GNU/Linux distributions
[11:35:04] <Vitali64vitali64> Many Linux experts (kernel) ported the mainline kernel to the poco f1, and they are working hard trying to get free drivers to work on it.
[11:36:11] <Vitali64vitali64> I hope that probably, in 5-10 years, this phone will be capable of running linux-libre
[11:36:45] <Vitali64vitali64> Isn't that awesome?
[11:37:42] <M6piz7wk[m]> Decided that I am going to wear horns on political things that involve software freedom to passively propagate FLOSS~
[11:38:30] <M6piz7wk[m]> And it being overwhelminglycute on my white hair is just a 99% of the reason to do so 
[11:39:25] <Vitali64vitali64> I am currently using a degoogled ROM with mostly free software, I mostly use fdroid for apps.
[11:39:46] <M6piz7wk[m]> > mostly
[11:39:46] <M6piz7wk[m]> Booo~
[11:39:59] <DiffieHellman> Vitali64vitali64: Probably, but sadly the mobile chipset probably can't have free software installed onto it and is actively sabotaging your.
[11:40:01] <DiffieHellman> -r
[11:40:14] <M6piz7wk[m]> Wait i use stadia.. unbooo~
[11:40:58] <Vitali64vitali64> It unfortunately has non free drivers in order for it to work
[11:41:08] <M6piz7wk[m]> Get pinephone then~
[11:41:43] <M6piz7wk[m]> The pohophones hold their economical value so you can probably easily sell it 
[11:41:47] <DiffieHellman> The pinephone still has a proprietary mobile chipset (which is at least behind usb, but still).
[11:42:05] <M6piz7wk[m]> Pinephone is rockchip..
[11:42:11] <Vitali64vitali64> DiffieHellman: DiffieHellman: You re probably right, now, but probably, in the future, it will be possible.
[11:42:49] <M6piz7wk[m]> Just the arch is viewed as proprietary bcs nvidia bought it and decides what happens with it.. but rockchip follows fsf ideology last time i checked 
[11:42:50] <Vitali64vitali64> Nowadays, even GNU Linux phones use non free drivers
[11:43:15] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: ARM was very proprietary even before nvidia bought it
[11:43:28] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: Rockchip aint 
[11:43:43] <DiffieHellman> Vitali64vitali64: It's GNU/Linux or GNU+Linux "GNU Linux" implies Linux is a GNU package (only GNU Linux-libre is).
[11:44:27] <M6piz7wk[m]> It wouldnt be my stay in fsf or someone didnt complain about the usage of Lignux~ 
[11:44:48] <Vitali64vitali64> DiffieHellman: Hey, probably! The MacBook2,1 was seen as proprietary back then, and now, I have one that uses only 100% free software, including firmware, os and drivers.
[11:45:22] <Vitali64vitali64> (Thanks! Libreboot!)
[11:45:27] <M6piz7wk[m]> Hmm o.O
[11:45:31] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: The thing is, ARM is more or less sells a blob of silicon to a SoC producer and only tells them how to talk to the pins. Pretty much, not even the SoC producer is not allowed to know what's inside the ARM core, which is pretty bad.

[11:46:52] <Vitali64vitali64> Works best with free software :)
[11:46:55] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: They make the SoC, sure. ARM sells them the core piece and they build around it pretty much
[11:47:12] <Vitali64vitali64> M6piz7wk[m]: Good idea!
[11:47:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> DiffieHellman: Nah everything from scratch last time i checked.. with the creepy stuff removed from a microcode
[11:48:58] <M6piz7wk[m]> Bcs apparently it was for a chinese government who rather decided to declare war on south for silicon~
[11:49:04] <Vitali64vitali64> I use a gnubook2,1 nowadays

[11:49:44] <Vitali64vitali64> I use a libreboot GnuBook2,1 nowadays
[11:49:50] <DiffieHellman> M6piz7wk[m]: Rockchip is fabless, so I don't believe they can do that. I don't think ARM sells HDL ARM cores anymore either. They could have reverse engineered the ARM core firmware and removed a few of the backdoors, sure.
[11:49:50] <M6piz7wk[m]> How can you put it so much effort to liberate the device and then insult all the free software on it by calling it macbook smh

[23:51:54] <M6piz7wk[m]> or..
[23:52:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> people will evolve and just use matrix instead of email like kreyyy
[23:52:07] <M6piz7wk[m]> even made the gov to use that to contact me
[23:52:08] <M6piz7wk[m]> heh
[23:52:19] <M6piz7wk[m]> ... and they loved it so much that they are now putting it everywhereee
[23:52:46] <echoSMILE> what do you mean? 
[23:53:06] <M6piz7wk[m]> https://conduit.rs/
[23:53:20] * M6piz7wk[m] uploaded an image: (45KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/tchncs.de/9d39f2d9363d0d336cdfbfea58b6cf1ad83899d0/image.png >
[23:53:30] <Noisytoot> Why Matrix?
[23:53:37] <M6piz7wk[m]> bcs it's cool
[23:53:38] <echoSMILE> is that a gov url?
[23:53:47] <Noisytoot> XMPP and IRC are better
[23:53:49] <M6piz7wk[m]> europe wants to use it in education, health administrattion etc..
[23:53:57] <M6piz7wk[m]> even paid like 50M EUR to support the project
[23:54:02] <M6piz7wk[m]> AND I STILL CAN'T GET CUSTOM EMOJIS
[23:54:04] * M6piz7wk[m] hard smash
[23:54:09] <M6piz7wk[m]> Noisytoot: it has XMPP and IRC
[23:54:22] <M6piz7wk[m]> and bs it being better
[23:54:24] <Noisytoot> submit them to unicode
[23:54:26] <echoSMILE> europe govs sucks, anything that can wash money is ok for them
[23:54:29] <M6piz7wk[m]> neither of them have good E2EE
[23:54:35] <Noisytoot> M6piz7wk[m], XMPP has good E2EE
[23:54:37] <Noisytoot> Matrix doesn't
[23:54:41] <M6piz7wk[m]> echoSMILE: WHY DO I SUCK
[23:54:44] <Noisytoot> not many Matrix clients support E2EE
[23:54:57] <echoSMILE> M6piz7wk[m] are you a euro gov?
[23:55:00] <M6piz7wk[m]> Noisytoot: all of em else not up to the standard and not matrix client
[23:55:05] <M6piz7wk[m]> echoSMILE: yes..ish
[23:55:27] <Noisytoot> M6piz7wk[m], Which ones except for Element support E2EE fully?
[23:55:38] <M6piz7wk[m]> dunno never checked the others
[23:55:44] <Noisytoot> Element is terrible
[23:55:51] <M6piz7wk[m]> how~
[23:55:54] <Noisytoot> XMPP has good E2EE: OMEMO, and many clients support it
[23:55:55] <echoSMILE> do you agree with public 50M€ for matrix  ?
[23:55:57] <M6piz7wk[m]> it's elementary
[23:56:07] <Noisytoot> It uses Electron, lots of RAM, and it possibly nonfree
[23:56:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> echoSMILE: i argued for 200M EUR
[23:56:30] <Noisytoot> Element can't be included in the FSD because it downloads stuff during runtime/build time or something like that
[23:56:34] *** Quits: Techman (Techman@user/techman) (Quit: Segmentation fault (core dumped))
[23:56:51] <echoSMILE> M6piz7wk[m] now you know why you suck then :D
[23:57:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> Noisytoot: "something like that" -> unqualified to say
[23:57:01] <M6piz7wk[m]> :p
[23:57:03] <Noisytoot> Also, I don't think Element would work well on a Pinephone
[23:57:11] <M6piz7wk[m]> echoSMILE: what! it's economical!
[23:57:21] <Noisytoot> I don't remember exactly what is was, but it can't be verified to be free
[23:57:22] <M6piz7wk[m]> and they would do only 5 M EUR otherwise 
[23:57:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> the art of politics!
[23:57:52] <M6piz7wk[m]> Noisytoot: So you want payment for you to keep yourself informed about your public statements?
[23:57:53] * M6piz7wk[m] smugs
[23:58:14] <Noisytoot> M6piz7wk[m], What do you mean?
[23:58:16] * M6piz7wk[m] forgot that muricans don't have an education system so by all means it makes sense
[23:58:23] <M6piz7wk[m]> Noisytoot: just poking :P
[23:58:24] <echoSMILE> Poor people like irc... they don't give a fuck about matrix
[23:58:28] *** Joins: Techman- (Techman@user/techman)
[23:58:35] <M6piz7wk[m]> i like IRC u.u
[23:58:37] <M6piz7wk[m]> not libera.chat though
[23:58:40] <Noisytoot> Also, the Matrix spec promotes reCAPTCHA: https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1#google-recaptcha
[23:58:54] <Noisytoot> Libera.Chat is much better than freenode
[23:59:09] <M6piz7wk[m]> Noisytoot: iirc i've submitted bug bounty on the libre captcha integration so feel free to integrate it~
[23:59:26] <M6piz7wk[m]> and i support proprietary if FLOSS doesn't have sufficient or superior implementation
[23:59:31] <echoSMILE> I like the blackout protocol
[23:59:47] <Noisytoot> I never support proprietary
[23:59:48] * M6piz7wk[m] even uses matrix instead of SIP now
