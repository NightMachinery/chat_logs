[05:38:39] <Henry151> https://bpa.st/Z3RA this is my new output from :scriptnames
[05:39:11] <Henry151> i remembered i had gone and installed `apt install vim-latexsuite` which was probably maybe causing all my issues?
[05:39:16] <Henry151> so i did apt remove that

[05:46:41] <Henry151> so looking at https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/411 i tried doing the super minimal vimrc, with the "let &rtp =..." lines like he describes there
[05:46:46] <Henry151> still had nothing working
[05:46:48] <Henry151> i gave up
[05:48:38] <R2robot> I don't use that plugin or pathogen, so I can't really help too much
[05:50:26] <Henry151> i'm trying again
[05:50:57] <Henry151> i moved my .vimrc to .vimrc_backup and my .vim to .vim_backup.. then i launch vim and run :scriptnames and i get this: https://bpa.st/IWYA is that fairly normal-looking?
[05:53:35] <j0ma> I know this has probably been covered a million times, but any tips for keeping my .vimrc in sync across devices? I've heard of using bare git repos, as well as about GNU Stow, but I'm a bit unclear about how it all works and don't want to over-invest in something super complicated before asking :D

[19:45:37] <Henry151> hi, i am on Debian using VIM - Vi IMproved 8.1 which i installed with apt; i am trying to use Ultisnips and getting these errors same as this person: https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/25511/ultisnips-py3-errors
[19:46:04] <Henry151> i just tried `apt remove vim` and `apt install vim` to refresh my installation but still having same issue
[19:46:05] <romainl> get a better Vim
[19:46:07] <Henry151> any ideas?
[19:46:10] <romainl> ^
[19:46:14] <zeraphel> gvim
[19:46:15] <Henry151> romainl: okiedokie
[19:46:33] <Henry151> i've never used gvim
[19:46:36] <Henry151> is it much different?
[19:46:40] <romainl> vim-gtk or vim-gnome package, something like that
[19:46:50] <romainl> the point is not to use gvim
[19:46:54] <zeraphel> just different compile flags, will still be available on the cli
[19:47:06] <romainl> the point is to have an executable buit with python support
[19:47:08] <zeraphel> ( check vim --version for the flags used )
[19:47:23] * zeraphel stops interrupting
[19:47:24] <romainl> *built
[19:47:26] <Henry151> ok so something like `apt remove vim` and `apt install gvim` and try it again?

[19:47:32] <romainl> no
[19:47:44] <romainl> check the packages available
[19:48:03] <romainl> the right package is called something like vim-gtk or vim-gnome
[19:48:46] <romainl> show us the list of vim packages and we will tell you which one to use
[19:48:48] <Henry151> i have vim-gtk and vim-gtk3 available
[19:48:59] <Henry151> also a vim-athena
[19:49:03] <romainl> vim-gtk3
[19:49:07] <Henry151> okiedokie
[19:49:53] <romainl> if you look at the package info it should tell you that it depends on py3 or something
[19:50:36] <romainl> wait… 8.1?
[19:50:44] <Henry151> i decided to take a computer science class from https://saylor.org and then I wanted to take notes, and needed to be able to do math symbols in the notes, so i googled about that and found https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1 and man i thought this is wicked cool
[19:50:50] <Henry151> yea 8.1
[19:51:08] * romainl sigh
[19:51:11] <Henry151> shouldn't that already have py3 support?
[19:51:24] <romainl> "that"?
[19:51:28] <Henry151> 8.1
[19:51:35] <romainl> unrelated
[19:51:38] <Henry151> oh ok.
[19:51:57] <romainl> but 8.1 is an old version, we are at 8.2, now, soonish 9.0
[19:52:00] <Henry151> anyway i have the vim-latex stuff working nicely but i wanted to do the snippets too
[19:52:10] <Henry151> oh sweet@

[19:54:45] <romainl> Henry151: FWIW, the last version of vim on stable is 8.2. Why do you have 8.1?
[19:55:08] <Henry151> romainl: I usually use the versions of packages that are provided by default from debian's apt
[19:55:20] <romainl> the default version is 8.2
[19:55:28] <romainl> https://packages.debian.org/stable/editors/vim-gtk3
[19:55:32] <Henry151> i may have just failed to do an apt update apt upgrade in a while

[19:56:20] <Henry151> ah yeah
[19:56:46] <Henry151> running my update upgrade now and i see it's going from buster to bullseye or something so sounds like i have forgotten to update for a while

[22:09:18] <habamax> hegemoOn: as for help being opening in a split window, by default, *I* think the reason is that 'hidden' setting is off by default. That makes it nearly impossible to open a help buffer in the same window if buffer is not saved
