[03:43:41] <parst> Hello how do I annotate some fields on a select_related() model?  Channel.objects.select_related("user") <-- I need to annotate some fields on the user objects
[03:46:57] <llanhmod> Hi! I am working through a OAuth set up using third party django-oauth2-toolkit. I currently have oauth2_provider.urls and rest_framework.urls inside the urlpatterns as well as settings.py where I have added the new app. However, running makemigrations produces this error `AttributeError: Manager isn't available; 'auth.User' has been swapped for 'users.User'` . Am I not allowed to use both .urls inside
[03:47:03] <llanhmod> the urlpatters object? Or is there something else causing this error. When I comment out the oauth configs, everything is fine (migrations don't complain).
[03:48:35] <llanhmod> Forgive me if this is newbish, I've never using oauth before and this is really a learning experience. Also writing a blog on my journey so, help might be mentioned for future users that follow my project.
[03:49:03] <parst> Are you using a custom User model?
[03:49:30] <llanhmod> parst: Yes, right now it is just an empty class with a pass statement.
[03:49:52] <parst> is this in your settings: AUTH_USER_MODEL = "users.User"
[03:49:58] <llanhmod> yep!
[03:50:08] <llanhmod> well, I commented it out but its there, yes.
[03:50:56] <parst> does it have a custom manager also?
[03:51:32] <llanhmod> well, the error says Manager isn't available...so I guess no?

[03:53:32] <llanhmod> parst: do you know if multiple .urls are allow in the urlpatters  list? I'd like to eleminate that as the cause if possible.
[03:53:39] <parst> It's hard to say, django-oauth2-toolkit has a few quirks.  does your users model look like this https://dpaste.org/QTA3
[03:53:45] * llanhmod could find so in docs..perhaps.
[03:54:20] <llanhmod> well...close to that..minus the UserManager class...
[03:54:42] <llanhmod> the oauth docs didn't mention that...so I didn't know. I do recall needed that in another project though.
[03:54:42] <parst> try adding the manager.  I don't know if that makes a difference.  Django should add the generic manager
[03:54:50] <llanhmod> ah, okay.

[03:59:04] <llanhmod> sorry I cannot help with you query. I don't know anything about what you're asking. :)
[03:59:59] <parst> that error message is because you need to subclass your user model from `django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractUser`
[04:00:53] <parst> the  you can remove the custom UserManager thing
[04:04:34] <llanhmod> Okay

[12:24:40] <yanchai> so in my case putting all common fields to my user table will be ok right? and wont have any problems in the future if my app grows bigger or something? this is the reason i cant decide because i read on the docs to decide about the custom user auth design beforehand to avoid pain in the future hehehe
[12:25:18] <yanchai> this is really challenging hahaha
[12:26:50] <duoi> yanchai not super challenging, provided youre subclassing django's default auth model you can always refactor later without much problems
[12:27:09] <duoi> it's "neater" for all intents and purposes to have a separate profile model however
[12:28:06] <duoi> my auth models usually end up limited to a UUID for a username and password, along with the standard is_staff/is_superuser
[12:28:19] <duoi> everything else like names, emails and similar would go into a profile model
[12:28:51] <yanchai> yeah its i did that before on my last project its just this project has 3 different profiles
[12:29:25] <yanchai> so separating them 3 having names, emails will be redundant
[12:29:47] <yanchai> since students and employees have uncommon field too
[12:30:37] <yanchai> what bob and the rest have suggested is to put all common fields into users table then put the uncommon to their respective profiles

[22:19:38] <aavrug> @ktosiek[m]: that's right I want group by field2, and the values will be something like field1 => userId, field2 => name. These two fields I am saving in analytics table and from the analytics table I am doing group by userId and in the values I want userId, name and additional fields. But when trying to fetch userId with name it is making group by together
[22:20:27] <aavrug> Other fields I did in annotate and it is working fine just name field not working because unable to do the annotate for the name field
[22:22:05] <ktosiek[m]> You can try doing .distinct('userId'), that should give you values from one of the grouped rows for non-aggregate fields

[22:53:11] <ktosiek> aavrug: what kind of "didn't work"? And how did you use it? Can you show print(response_data.query)?
[23:00:26] <aavrug> @ktosiek: SELECT DISTINCT "app_analytics"."id", "app_analytics"."name", COUNT("api_analytics"."prod_type") FILTER (WHERE "api_analytics"."prod_type" = FRESH_PRODUCT) AS "count" FROM "api_analytics" WHERE ("api_analytics"."id" = 78345) GROUP BY "api_analytics"."id", "api_analytics"."name" LIMIT 25
[23:00:28] <ktosiek> oh, you could also use something like PostgreSQL's last_value() as an aggregate for "name", but I'm not sure if Django already wraps that function
[23:01:50] <ktosiek> you did a .distinct(), not a .distinct('id'). But now I'm not sure if distinct(*fields) can be mixed with aggregations, so maybe wrapping a last_value() or writing a raw query would work better

[23:03:48] <ktosiek> wrapping last_value() it is, then. Let me see if there's any documentation on that

[23:06:53] <aavrug> Also going through the doc
[23:08:42] <ktosiek> wait, don't listen to me, it's a window function and not a simple aggregate
[23:10:24] <aavrug> I am really sorry but now I am confused
[23:10:27] <ktosiek> maybe just throw a Max('name') as an annotation? You don't seem to care which name you get
[23:10:41] <aavrug> Yes
[23:10:48] <aavrug> Let me try that
[23:12:20] <ktosiek> "window function" is a different kind of SQL function. I assumed last_name() is an aggregate function, that can be used with "group by", but it's not. It's a window function, that's used in "last_value(column) OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY .. etc.)"
[23:13:30] <aavrug> The Max('name') worked
[23:14:04] <aavrug> I am not sure about window functions I'll definitely read about it
