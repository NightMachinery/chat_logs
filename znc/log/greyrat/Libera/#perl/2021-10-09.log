[00:00:21] <karjala> Question: if we have our mojo::mysql queries placed in model classes, and an atomic transaction defined in a controller needs one to execute one query from one class and another query from another class, what’s a nice way to pass the $db object around? Usually these model methods aren’t executed in a transaction, so more often than not there’s no need to pass $db.
[00:01:12] <mst> karjala: why are you needing to do that?
[00:01:20] <karjala> One way I used is to allow $db to be any of the arguments of the model functions, and having it spliced
[00:01:28] <karjala> Do what mst?
[00:02:05] <mst> what's the concrete use case for this?
[00:02:30] <mst> what's the controller action, what are the models, what are the methods, what's actually happening here?
[00:02:37] <karjala> The use case is a codebase I inherited, in which each query is in a model class
[00:02:44] <karjala> Ok
[00:02:47] <karjala> Here
[00:03:22] <karjala> The controller action is “create a row in each of two tables, atomically”
[00:03:30] <mst> which tables and why?
[00:03:40] <mst> I said *concrete* use case
[00:03:54] <mst> you're just giving me more wobbly metaphors and that doesn't help me :(

[00:04:45] <karjala> Table master and table slave (with a one-to-many relation)
[00:05:13] <karjala> These are still metaphors but more concrete than before
[00:05:20] <mst> close enough
[00:05:23] <mst> so that should be a single model method call, and one model should talk to the other model, just like you can do with ->create in DBIC
[00:05:31] <mst> and then the protocol can be agreed between the model objects
[00:06:02] <karjala> Yes
[00:06:05] <karjala> Thanks
[00:06:09] <mst> and then within the model objects, I'd consider something like
[00:06:17] <mst> assuming the model object "has 'db';"
[00:06:22] <mst> you can provide a method
[00:06:36] <mst> sub with_db ($self, $db) { $self->new(%$self, db => $db) }
[00:06:39] <mst> so
[00:07:19] <mst> sub insert ($self, \%me, \%related) { <start tx>; <do insert>; <get other model>; $other->with_db($db)->insert(\%related); <commit>; }
[00:07:42] <mst> if you don't have 'db' as an attribute ... consider -that- a metaphor and adapt it :D
[00:08:27] <karjala> Nice, thanks
[00:08:37] <mst> honestly you may not want to have db as an attribute tbh, might be too easy to open multiple connections and/or hang onto them for too long, but the general idea should, I hope, make sense
[00:08:49] * shaldannon now curious arguments for/against using $self vs $this
[00:08:57] <mst> perl standard is $self
[00:09:16] <mst> any time I see code using $this, I assume the author doesn't know perl and immediately audit the entire thing for bugs before doing anything else
[00:09:47] <shaldannon> oh you'd hate my code then ... I picked up using $this from someone else and kept right on using it :-}
[00:10:08] <mst> there are a few people like you
[00:10:15] <mst> but usually it's a tell for "author doesn't know perl"
[00:10:21] <shaldannon> ... who need their heads examine? :-D
[00:10:39] <shaldannon> but yeah, I've seen people write C in Perl
[00:10:52] <shaldannon> and PHP in Perl
[00:11:02] <shaldannon> and Delphi in Perl
[00:11:37] <shaldannon> and, frankly, actual shell script embedded in perl ... liberal use of ``
[00:11:51] <mst> indeed
[00:12:42] <shaldannon> the worst I ever had ... I took a job and inherited someone's "perl" script for collecting system statistics and reporting it back to a Windows API service via Soap::Lite
[00:13:44] <shaldannon> it nominally had a program file and a perl library, but nothing was strict, all variables were implicitly passed, and it had hideousness like opening a <FH> in one sub, use it in another, and close it in a third
[00:14:12] <shaldannon> oh, and sometimes a sub in the "library" would call a sub in the main file
[00:14:32] <shaldannon> it took me weeks to refactor the heck out of that, starting with strict
[00:16:47] <mst> oof
[00:16:50] <gordonfish> I remember seeing $this used in old perl book that I read somewhere around 2000-ish
[00:17:11] <gordonfish> (Or perhaps it was a CGI book maybe)
[00:17:12] <shaldannon> that'd be about the time I picked it up at a job
[00:17:35] <mst> shaldannon: but yeah, it's no criticism of you, but that reaction to seeing $this has been right more often than not and saved me a lot of pain later, so I'm going to continue to default to that :D
[00:17:38] <shaldannon> and they were using heavy Mason, Class::MethodMaker, and Exception::Class
[00:17:54] <shaldannon> yeah, go with your past experience
[00:17:58] <mst> that's actually not a bad set of kit for the era
[00:18:19] <shaldannon> yeah, it was pretty well designed
[00:18:55] <shaldannon> it was an in-house content management system that rendered new site pages from a database and saved them pre-cached to a web root
[00:19:48] <shaldannon> same place where I learned regex for those nasty photo galleries I mentioned
[00:21:13] <shaldannon> when the 9/11/01 attacks happened, the head sysadmin showed the traffic graph to me ... we were saturating 2 OC-3's, main image had the highest requests because other news sites were linking to it, main page was a distant second, most everything else barely registered
[00:21:26] <mst> hah, *nice*
[00:21:46] <karjala> I’m creating a Jabber server in Perl these days, because I found the other servers too complex or buggy or both.
[00:21:54] <mst> I spent the day telling people to stop bloody loading the BBC live stream at their desk because we'd already put it on the giant screen in the central office room
[00:21:58] <shaldannon> one of our guys had a screenshot of Internet Explorer trying to connect to MSN, with a 404, "other suggested sites: msn.com"
[00:22:09] <shaldannon> lol
[00:22:13] <karjala> Sorry, interrupted
[00:22:23] <mst> karjala: it's IRC, we can interleave
[00:22:48] <shaldannon> yeah, everything here is pretty much radio chatter; follow the convo you want and ignore the rest
[00:23:06] <shaldannon> and comment whenever you like
[00:23:41] <karjala> (ok, going on) Now that XMPP clients support message archive retrieval from the server, Jabber seems like a nice way to chat.
[00:24:29] <karjala> I’ve tried Gajim, Psi+, and Pidgin. The first two are good.
[00:24:39] <shaldannon> if I want message retrieval here, I go see if rindolf put the log up on his site :-}

[00:27:23] <mst> karjala: modern XMPP is quite impressive
[00:27:42] <shaldannon> mst: I was mostly joking ... and usually only check that site when I'm looking for some clever bit of snark I made ages ago

[00:54:44] <Grinnz> clscott: if it's for test files, Test2::V0 has a nice interface for doing so
[00:54:57] <Grinnz> if it's for production code, it's a bit more complex to find such
[00:55:03] *** Parts: pe (~p@user/pe) ()
[00:55:26] <Grinnz> Test::Deep::NoTest is a somewhat hacky way
[00:55:28] <clscott> No, it's for validating input to a subroutine that will modify the has in place subroutine(\%structure)
[00:55:28] <Exodist> The Test2::V0 stuff all has a non-test library base that can and has been used for data structure verification outside of tests
[00:55:41] <Grinnz> Exodist: oh?
[00:55:45] <gordonfish> The error indicates that Foo->SUPER::xyz is main::xyz, which exists, but can't be found. What is going on here?
[00:56:03] <clscott> I just want to make sure it "looks ok" before diving in because it's going to me very large. The most basic of sanity checks
[00:56:05] <Exodist> Test2::Compare, the library itself does not produce any test results, it produces a delta, and you can write non-test code to verify your strucutre and check the delta.
[00:56:09] *** Quits: kitsunenokenja (~kitsunech@68.91.220.96) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[00:56:16] <Grinnz> nice
[00:56:28] <Exodist> Test2::Tools::Compare then uses that library to write is() and like()
[00:56:54] <Exodist> I mainly did that to make custom test tools easier to write, but he unexpected benefit was the library is useful outside of testing
[00:57:23] <gordonfish> Well this is interesting (and perhaps I've found a bug in the error reporting):

[00:57:27] <perlbot> gordonfish: ["This is Foo::xyz","This is UNIVERSAL::xyz"]
[00:57:36] <Exodist> a lot of the helper functions you use inside an is() nested strucutre that are exported by Test2::Tools::Compare can also be resued as most of them help produce a detla, not assertions.
[00:57:36] *** Quits: humky (~humky@user/humky) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:58:22] <gordonfish> So 'ERROR: Can't locate object method "xyz" via package "main"' is incorrect, it should be saying 'via package "UNIVERSAL"', unless there is a reason for it saying main instead that I'm unaware of.
[00:58:33] <Grinnz> how can you get the hash {} and such check functions to use with Test2::Compare?
[00:59:24] <Exodist> you can use the ones from Test2::Tools::Compare, they will just work

[01:01:29] <gordonfish> (I tried UNIVERSAL as I recalled it is something any top level class implicitly inherits from, or so I recall, and that's what SUPER:: refers to on a class without a defined @ISA.)
[01:02:48] <Grinnz> UNIVERSAL isn't actually in @ISA so it won't find it
[01:03:04] <Grinnz> i'm not sure if ->SUPER:: makes sense on something with empty @ISA
[01:03:18] <Grinnz> but that does sound odd
[01:03:59] <gordonfish> Yeah that's why I said implicitly inherits from. What seems to be a bug is the error reporting that it's looking in main when it is really looking in UNIVERSAL.
[01:04:07] <Grinnz> i think it's because you're calling ->SUPER:: while in package main, not in package Foo
[01:04:15] <gordonfish> Oh

[04:07:13] <leont> There isn't any good Perl blog platform, because the deployment requirements (cheap and idiot proof deployment essentially) in most places make php the obvios choice.
[04:07:40] <Grinnz> raku is a new unrelated language that makes their own decisions
[04:09:55] <Guest49> I understand ))

[04:11:38] <leont> Raku is a fascinating language for learning new concepts, but it's kind of lacking infrastructure required to make it a good option IME
[04:11:40] <zgu> php certainly is idiot proof
[04:11:50] <zgu> i mean, seeing someone use php is proof they're an idiot
[04:13:31] <leont> The important part is that an idiot admin can deploy it, which isn't really true for pretty much any other technology. That's why Wordpress is more than a third of the internet.

[04:16:00] <xenu> let's say there's a module, Foo and various submodules Foo::A, Foo::B etc
[04:16:10] <xenu> each of the modules will be in its own cpan distribution
[04:16:25] *** Quits: krismatrix (~krismatri@38.80.149.51) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:16:50] <xenu> when Foo gets updated, Foo::* need to be updated too because it's an XS module with unstable ABI
[04:18:46] <xenu> is there a sane way to do it? currently i see two options
[04:18:51] <xenu> 1) Foo's Makefile.PL should search for any installed Foo::* modules and dynamically declare dependency on their newer versions
[04:18:54] <xenu> 2) Foo::* should die when Foo is incompatible with them
[04:19:35] <Grinnz> there is no sane way to do it, no
[04:19:40] <Grinnz> the XS::Framework approach is 2
[04:19:53] <Grinnz> 1 doesn't solve anything
[04:21:00] <Grinnz> i believe LeoNerd's approach is "keep supporting the old ABI" now
[04:21:30] <xenu> this is mostly theoretical because i'm too busy
[04:21:38] <xenu> but i was thinking about making tree-sitter bindings
[04:21:48] <xenu> and that would require something like that
[04:22:04] <xenu> Foo is tree-sitter, and Foo::* are language parsers
[04:22:22] <xenu> so i don't control the ABI unfortunately
[04:22:51] <Grinnz> the least terrible way is probably to put everything in the same dist
[04:23:14] <xenu> there are many third party parsers
[04:23:16] <Guest49> Raku usid in production small comanies?
[04:23:22] <Guest49> used

[04:23:43] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Breaks - Add metadata about potential breakages caused by your distribution ... ]
[04:24:07] <xenu> python's binding seem to take another approach: they build tree sitter with required languages on demand
[04:24:10] <xenu> which imo is even more insane
[04:24:54] *** Joins: X-Scale (~ARM@50.77.166.178.rev.vodafone.pt)
[04:26:56] <xenu> ether: that would work if it supported wildcards
[04:27:16] <xenu> also, are cpan installer using that field?
[04:27:20] <xenu> installers*
[04:30:36] <Grinnz> i don't think so
[04:30:47] <Grinnz> if they are it's only via https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Meta::Requirements determination
[04:30:48] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ CPAN::Meta::Requirements - a set of version requirements for a CPAN dist - metacpan.org ]
[04:31:03] <Grinnz> which i dont think looks at x_ fields
[04:33:19] <xenu> okay, so the first step is to make my own cpan client
[04:33:50] <Grinnz> and keep a database of installed modules, yes
[04:41:18] <Guest49> when Perl 7 releseed&
[04:41:54] <xenu> no one knows, https://gist.github.com/Grinnz/be5db6b1d54b22d8e21c975d68d7a54f
[04:41:54] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ Perl 7 FAQ · GitHub ]
[04:45:26] <Guest49> thanks
[04:45:56] <ether> yeah, to do this for realz you need support in the cpan client - so you can queue things to install after you've installed the first thing(s)
[04:46:36] <Grinnz> to do this for real you basically need an rpmdb

[06:12:10] <mst> rbraun: this may take some time, but the original idea was terribad, so I'm ok if we take time to find something that's actually good

[11:33:16] <El_Che> scp1: so your function must be able to work with corner cases
[11:33:29] <El_Che> scp1: nothing special about the test, imho

[11:36:44] <scp1> el_che, https://pastebin.com/BQPVHK30 , I need to make sure I know what I'll get back so I can test it. For example, on my machine,  ls_color('/usr/share/doc/laleh.pm') will return "\e[38;5;30m/usr/share/doc/\e[m\e[38;5;203mlaleh.pm\e[m", on yours it will probably not. Therefore I want to set predefined values

[23:44:50] <ehuelsmann[m]> I have a consistent test failure on Perl 5.20 (but not on 5.14 or 5.26) trying to install Syntax::Keyword::Try (on this test run: https://github.com/jonasbn/perl-workflow/pull/173/checks?check_run_id=3848046622) ; the complaint is XS::Parse::Keyword::Builder failed to bulid.

[23:44:54] <ehuelsmann[m]> does that ring a bell?
[23:45:17] <ehuelsmann[m]> my point is: I'm only getting that with 5.20; not  with the other versions.
[23:45:54] <ehuelsmann[m]> it would be great to be able to resolve this error, if I knew how.

[23:45:58] <Grinnz> 5.20 seems to trigger a few XS bugs unfortunately
[23:46:08] <Grinnz> LeoNerd would be the one to ask
[23:46:31] <ehuelsmann[m]> LeoNerd: hi. around?
