[01:39:10] <JakeSays> why the quotes?
[01:39:11] <Slade> recommended way for upgradig to 2022?
[01:39:19] <Slade> tho i guess you dont upgrade. you just install both
[01:39:22] <jonp> VS2019 16.something circa May of last year had *preview* support for .NET 6
[01:39:37] <jonp> but only VS2022 has support for *final* .NET 6
[01:39:46] <brianonymous> i let you guys get the bugs out
[01:39:55] <JakeSays> typical ms.
[01:40:13] <Slade> i'm assuming its mostly related to win11

[01:40:20] <JakeSays> if i'm forced to upgrade to get .net 6 support i'll go with a different ide

[01:40:35] <JakeSays> rider
[01:40:53] <Slade> why are we angry about 2022?
[01:41:15] <jonp> you mean there are things we shouldn't be angry about? </snark>
[01:41:22] <JakeSays> i already use rider on linux. vs doesn't offer enough to justify the upgrade
[01:42:06] <Slade> jonp, you're right, this channel has a general angst against the world. so yea, anger is probably default
[01:42:41] <JakeSays> i can't use 2022 due to lack of 32 bit support
[01:42:50] <JakeSays> which.. is ironic
[01:42:55] <Slade> why are you 32bitting

[03:43:24] <brianonymous> thats uaully for racks in a colo
[03:43:32] <bomb> KVM-over-IP connects to the internet
[03:43:49] <JakeSays> ...
[03:44:03] <JakeSays> a machine that is offline doesn't connect to anything
[03:44:18] <bomb> it does not
[03:44:50] <bomb> you connect to another machine called KVM
[03:44:56] <brianonymous> back when we ran our own colo, we had one, and you could press the power/reset buttons.. its for if you need bios or if you need to see OS boot errors.. that kinda crap
[03:45:45] <JakeSays> ah so it's not a kvm that runs on the target machine
[03:45:54] <brianonymous> no, it was its own appliance type thing
[03:46:00] <JakeSays> ah ok

[11:11:34] <ravindUwU> In ASP.NET Core, when you `services.AddOptions<TOptions>(config.GetSection(...))`, is there any way to immediately retrieve the `IOptions<TOptions>` to continue configuring more services? 🤔

[12:00:10] <Nasp> ravindUwU: config.GetValue().Get<> instead
[12:04:25] <ravindUwU> Nasp, thanks! I ended up with `var options = config.GetSection(...).Get<TOptions>() ; services.AddSingleton(options)`
[12:04:30] <ravindUwU> MaNa4k, morning 😇
[12:07:10] <Nasp> Although remember you can access those config in other places with DI
[12:07:23] <Nasp> So you may not need to get it out when configuring
[12:07:43] <Nasp> Also using i this way may remove the IOptions<T> part which i never really use anyways
[12:08:31] <ravindUwU> But services must be conditionally registered based on the config? All service registrations go in Startup.ConfigureServices, don't they?
[12:12:36] <Nasp> yeah but what im asking is why do you need to get the config out
[12:13:39] <ravindUwU> Ohhh do you mean register all services at startup, and conditionally use them? :o

[12:32:45] <MatthiasVance> ravindUwU: Can  you share some code?
[12:33:04] <MatthiasVance> Or is it as simple as, right now you're using configuration to decide which service to register?
[12:33:12] <MatthiasVance> And not instantiating said services yourself with configuration
[12:34:39] <ravindUwU> So in appsettings.json I've got a key "Cache" which is either "InMemory" or "Sqlite". I'd like to register IDistributedCache based on this key, using the `AddDistributedMemoryCache` or `AddSqliteCache` respectively.
[12:36:47] <MatthiasVance> ravindUwU: Ah, that makes sense indeed!
[12:37:17] <ravindUwU> Should've led with this lol my bad
[12:38:03] <Nasp> Ahh yeah that makes sense
[12:40:24] <MatthiasVance> ravindUwU: Was just double checking, sometimes people that ask these kind of questions are going on a wrong path and I want to make sure they don't. :D But you were doing The Right Thing (tm) all along.
[12:40:53] <MatthiasVance> I'm also thinking if it's always one or the other in Development, could do an environment check instead
[12:41:05] <Nasp> No
[12:41:10] <Nasp> Environment checks are bad mkay
[12:41:33] <MatthiasVance> So you don't add extended error pages in Development?
[12:41:48] <MatthiasVance> I'd rather have my application default to safe usage than production usage :p
[12:41:49] <Nasp> Sure but that would probably be one of the only exceptions
[12:41:55] <Nasp> Also it's hidden in our defaults
[12:42:15] <Nasp> I just hate when people os IsDev IsProd for everything that should be a setting
[12:42:35] <Nasp> I've seen this waaay to often if (IsProd) { hardcoded prod credentials here }
[12:42:54] <jmer> Nasp: lol
[12:43:01] <Nasp> I still find it
[12:43:15] <Nasp> We had a security audit and i choose to report all of them
[12:43:17] <ravindUwU> MatthiasVance, Nasp, thanks ^^
[12:43:17] <Nasp> There was like 40 or so
[12:43:31] <MatthiasVance> Nasp: Well yeah that is just dumb
[12:43:45] <Nasp> The one who audited us kept asking "What are these secrets in source control you keep reporting?"
[12:43:59] <MatthiasVance> I just meant as a switch, if you're in development, by default use in memory stuff
[12:44:08] <MatthiasVance> Otherwise, expect config to configure "real" stuff
[12:44:13] <Nasp> That would be fine
[12:44:25] <Nasp> But i prefer to minimize it as much as possible
[12:44:33] <Nasp> Sadly others dont
[12:44:59] <jmer> I recently saw a solution where inmemory DB for EF was configured... but never used... Not even in the test projects
[12:45:03] <Nasp> Also passing around IsProd bools "public void SomeMethod(bool isProd) "
[12:45:24] <Nasp> I find the worst is these bools then changes something many places in the codebase, and you have no idea of what exactly
[12:45:42] <jmer> Generally I find it confusing when bools are used as parameters
[12:46:20] <Nasp> Yup
[12:46:25] <Nasp> It's not conveing much information
[12:46:35] <Nasp> SomeMethod(true)
[12:46:37] <Nasp> Ohh thanks :D

[15:59:29] <jmer> Maybe you just need to find a company that's not super shit
[15:59:50] <SKull> although it's actually better than 'meh', since i have no problems with being unemployed. but my partner thinks it's vitally important that i get another job asap
[16:00:19] <SKull> well, i read in the newspaper that they are frantically looking for people to help with covid contact tracing
[16:00:33] <jmer> I doubt that's any better than IT
[16:00:34] <SKull> i'm hoping to get a gig like that to get a little break from IT
[16:00:38] <jmer> But it's probably well paid
[16:01:12] <SKull> it's better in the sense that i'm doing something other than abstracting boring business shit in an environment full of incompetent IT people
[16:01:19] <jmer> lol
[16:02:19] <SKull> really, Swiss IT is painful, all they know is "next -> next -> finish", everything other than that requires external help
[16:02:30] <SKull> expensive external help
[16:02:32] <jmer> Get hired at one of those external companies then
[16:03:01] <SKull> jmer: they don't know any more. usually they then call microsoft support, and i've never heard an answer from those guys
[16:03:52] <SKull> jmer: and no one does development in interesting areas, it's always just some internal pseudo ERP software
[16:04:16] <SKull> and the few that do interesting work are hard to come by and as of now don't want me

[16:04:55] <jmer> loving every moment of it.
[16:05:03] <SKull> plus, every company acts like they're big shot enterprises but lack the planning and structure of actual big shot enterprises
[16:05:05] <jmer> best fucking decision in a long, long time
[16:05:13] <jmer> SKull: lol... definately
[16:05:42] <SKull> jmer: oh, and here's a fucked up story:
[16:06:04] <SKull> i applied for messerli informatik ag, which has been the main supplier for software to the construction industry in switzerland for 40 years
[16:06:14] <SKull> then my cellphone rang
[16:06:18] <SKull> it was mr. messerli in person
[16:06:24] <SKull> now about 80 years old
[16:06:28] <SKull> and still involved in the company
[16:06:44] <SKull> he then told me for 20 minutes that my CV is shit, and why i'm shit
[16:07:03] <SKull> he then ended the call after 20 minutes saying: our head of tech is going to invite you for an interview
[16:07:22] <SKull> like, why did you call me if you don't want me? o.O
[16:07:28] <SKull> then i got said invitation
[16:07:30] <jonp> implying that they only hire shit people?
[16:07:34] <SKull> i thought about it over the weekend
[16:07:37] <jonp> or the ceo is an asshole
[16:07:51] <SKull> then on monday i cancelled the interview, stating that i don't see myself working in that company
[16:07:59] <SKull> the head of tech then asked for a reason
[16:07:59] <jmer> Well...
[16:08:19] <SKull> a week later i replied to him that the old fart called me in person just to tell me that i'm shit
[16:08:23] <SKull> and the head of tech goes:
[16:08:25] <jmer> I've been in more than one company that was pleasant enough to work in even though the owner/CEO were assholes
[16:08:50] <SKull> "oh, yeah that happens to most of the people applying at our company, i'm understand and i'm sorry."
[16:08:54] <SKull> imagine working there
[16:08:56] <SKull> jesus
[16:09:04] <jmer> well
[16:09:22] <SKull> having some mental 80 year old still meddling in your business
[16:09:26] <jmer> if you're an 80 year old guy who created a company from scratch you probably get some kind of god complex
[16:09:50] <SKull> yeah, but they really NEED new developers. good luck finding them
[16:09:59] <SKull> and good riddance to that old fuck
[16:10:00] <jmer> SKull: I agree!! definately
[16:10:20] <jmer> and if you're in a financial situation that lets you be picky I think you should be :P
[16:10:41] <SKull> yeah, the lady at the unemployment office is already unhappy with me
[16:10:58] <SKull> because the only leverage she has, which is deducting money, doesn't really work on me ^^
[16:11:05] <jmer> oh well fuck her
[16:11:35] <jmer> I managed to dodge those types in my unemployment periods (which have been rare and brief)
[16:12:31] <SKull> meh, i paid my taxes, so i'm applying for that money. by boyfriend also said that he wouldn't apply for it if he was me. but if there's money to be had, i'm applying ^^
[16:12:47] <jmer> Yeah I agree.
[16:12:56] <jmer> Gotta get that tax money back somehow
[16:13:01] <SKull> yup
[16:13:41] <SKull> also, next week i'm invited to an ICT assesment. ICT is the group that defines swiss IT education
[16:14:11] <jmer> really?
[16:14:14] <SKull> i've never done any ICT education to begin with, and i know from experience that their people aren't the most competent in the field.... i wonder how that will go ^^
[16:14:18] <jmer> my education is named "ICT Engineer"
[16:14:52] <jmer> What does ICT stand for in your case?
[16:15:19] <SKull> i ... don't actually know
[16:16:19] <SKull> i imagine the same as in your case
[16:16:44] <SKull> information and communications technology i assume
[16:17:09] <SKull> but they very well could just name themselves government microsoft gold partner
[16:17:15] <SKull> because that's all they teach
[16:17:17] <jmer> looool
[16:17:44] <jmer> Well Microsoft is widespread
[16:17:51] <jmer> it's easy to use and it works well enough
[16:17:56] <SKull> well... nothing wrong with that
[16:18:33] <SKull> but the fact is, most of IT is still based on 40 year old technology, if you understand those technologies you can use all kinds of products instead of just microsoft
[16:18:48] <SKull> but if you only teach microsoft, microsoft is all they are going to know
[16:19:22] <jmer> I know what you mean.
[16:19:33] <SKull> at my last company, the IT security guy told me: "you shouldn't be able to have your own VPN!", my answer was: "i know, right? the fact that i can tells me you don't know what you're doing."
[16:20:01] <jmer> SKull: your own VPN in what way? With access to the company systems or?
[16:20:26] <jmer> Does an SSH tunnel count as VPN? :P
[16:20:27] <SKull> jmer: the vpn was a simple OpenVPN client (default port) <-> my VPS server
[16:20:36] <SKull> so i could open the vpn at home, and RDP to my workstation
[16:20:37] <jmer> Ah so VPN access to your home network?
[16:21:10] <SKull> because the company chose 'pulse secure' as a vpn client, which was a) already insecure (multiple known exploits existed) and b) painfully slow
[16:21:39] <jmer> I don't have much knowhow about VPn setups on hand but it wouldn't take me long to find out if I needed it ^^
[16:21:59] <SKull> jmer: it took me half an hour of reading the official OpenVPN manual to set it up
[16:22:04] <SKull> it's not wichcraft
[16:22:12] *** Joins: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda)
[16:22:20] <SKull> and i'm in no way an IT-sec guy
[16:22:36] <SKull> i know how to set up ssh keys and use them, that's about all of my IT sec knowledge
[16:22:47] <jmer> The closest thing I get to that is using SSH tunnels to route http traffic to my home server, back at my gymnasium days, to bypass the schools website blocking and surveilance
[16:23:24] <SKull> that's why i run a VPS. then i can just ssh to that. no company or school firewall ever prevented that ^^
[16:26:38] <jmer> well this was bakc in the days where I was super poor and living at home :D
[16:26:42] <jmer> I couldn't afford a VPS
[16:26:48] <SKull> i've been there
[16:26:52] <jmer> haven't we all
[16:27:10] <SKull> but my home server died one day and i had no reason to setup a new one by that time
[16:27:25] <jmer> back then ISPs didn't give routers, but modems
[16:27:53] <jmer> so I needed a proper router to, one; share the internet between the family instead of just one computer, two; get proper security
[16:27:54] <SKull> plus, my current ISP has really shitty routers that reset themselves to default settings every once in a while, and dyndns also died a couple years ago
[16:28:14] <jmer> I still need to figure out how to set up my own router for my new connection
[16:28:17] <SKull> so a VPS for 7$ a month really is no biggie for my budget
[16:28:24] <jmer> it wouldn't be for me now
[16:28:30] <jmer> but when your monthly income is 0
[16:28:36] <jmer> even 7$ pr month becomes a challenge xD
[16:28:45] <SKull> it does. f

[16:30:06] <Nasp> They need to be cheap
[16:30:11] <jmer> Nasp: I have kviknet now.. It actually seems decent enough
[16:30:21] <jmer> I mean, it's not TOTAL shit.
[16:30:25] <SKull> Nasp: yeah, i suspect that that is in fact the only factor my ISP considers when ordering routers
[16:30:29] <jmer> the admin interface actually works
[16:31:10] <SKull> jmer: my router wouldn't be TOTAL shit too, if it weren't for he random factory resets it does
[16:31:24] <SKull> no point in even configuring your own WIFI password
[16:31:42] <jmer> SKull: I asked for a change (getting a static IP instead of dynamic)... And instead of the router just rebooting it just starting flashing all it's lights
[16:31:42] <SKull> because every couple of weeks it just resets itself
[16:31:52] <jmer> it did so for several days until I realized it was it's way to ttell me it needed a reboot
[16:32:07] <jmer> everything worked fine though
[16:32:17] <SKull> blinking lights: "END MY SUFFERING, REINCARNATE ME"
[16:32:44] <SKull> i don't even dare to look up how many known security issues that weird thing has

[16:35:46] <SKull> kobo: just use git bash like a sane person
[16:36:07] <jmer> SKull: I've heard good things about them and they are recommended by many "experts"
[16:36:50] <SKull> jmer: could be. as i said, i haven't heard 'bad things' about them either. that must be a good sign.
[16:37:25] <jmer> it's relatively expensive though, but  it should be quite intuitive and easy to use... Which is a boon because... I'm too lazy to learn complex network crap I only have to set up once

[16:48:24] <SKull> Nasp: i was thinking about getting one that runs OpenWRT or Tomato, but those go for about 400$, and i have no REAL reason to get one, so i put that aquisition on the backburner
[16:49:07] <jmer> My router can run OpenWRT and it's not 400$
[16:49:23] <jmer> it's an older model but even when new it was something like 150€ or something
[16:49:34] <SKull> neat

[17:26:58] <Flonk> jonp, what would you prefer? My class has like 20-30 properties.
[17:27:16] <jonp> if it's 20-30, i'd suggest providing default values for the props
[17:27:30] <jonp> it'll cause GC "garbage" on prop-set, but it'll ensure things don't go wrong
[17:27:43] <jonp> *or*… why's Bar need to be settable?
[17:27:57] <jonp> `public IList<int> Bar {get;} = new List<int>();`
[17:28:10] <jonp> then you can do: `new Foo { Bar = { 1, 2, 3, }, … }`
[17:28:57] <jonp> (`IList` so that it can be versioned, or consider Collection<T>`

[17:30:10] <jonp> but does answer why you want it settable
[17:30:16] <Flonk> Providing default values is the way to go then still

[21:20:58] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: yes

[21:21:38] <DevJohnC> and if you add items after the foreach has started?
[21:22:25] <Suchiman> DevJohnC: it's less of a monitoring, to be precise, Parallel.ForEach has no clue, it just gets an IEnumerable, the magic is in BlockingCollection<T> which just blocks when calling MoveNext while not having any items left to give

[21:42:09] <DevJohnC> redoc, I shoved a gRPC server into the product and did interop using gRPC :)
[21:42:21] <DevJohnC> redoc, which meant learning a LOT about blending swift with objc++
[21:42:46] <redoc> well hopefully you use that knowledge again one day...
[21:42:47] <DevJohnC> redoc, oh and Swift packages won't work if your target configs don't share names with the packages you're consuming
[21:43:19] <DevJohnC> and XCode's toolchain doesn't let you address that, at all, or if it does I couldn't find it documented
[21:43:30] <redoc> I had a hell of a time getting macOS to let me hook into the keyboard
[21:43:42] <redoc> c#, python, i just failed
[21:43:52] <DevJohnC> macOS dev pain solidarity!
[21:44:46] <redoc> so fun 😄
[21:45:16] <redoc> DevJohnC: do you have the M1 chip?
[21:46:10] <DevJohnC> yeah I have two of them here, an M1 mac mini and an M1 max macbook pro
[21:46:22] <redoc> ballllller
[21:46:42] <redoc> im so impressed with this chip
[21:46:49] <DevJohnC> the mac mini RAM limits make me sad for dev work
[21:46:56] <DevJohnC> yeah, the M1 max is super impressive
[21:47:03] <jonp> i'm looking forward to a mac mini w/ M1 Max
[21:47:09] <jonp> hopefully they release such a thing
[21:47:12] <redoc> i bought the bottom end mac mini w/ 16gb and it was so damn impressive i got the m1 air 16gb
[21:47:21] <DevJohnC> jonp, if they do I hope they let you put more RAM in the damn thing
[21:47:27] <DevJohnC> 16GB max is not enough
[21:47:29] <Miles8of9> mac mini has soldered ram on the motherboard to avoid ram upgrades!! LOL APPLE
[21:47:30] <Diablo-D3> nope.
[21:47:36] <Diablo-D3> its built like a phone.
[21:47:39] <jonp> DevJohnC: hence "M1 Max" -- 64GB max
[21:47:41] <Diablo-D3> because its basically a phone.
[21:47:42] <jonp> up from 16
[21:47:50] <redoc> Miles8of9: been that way since like 2012
[21:47:57] <Diablo-D3> before 2012
[21:48:09] <redoc> my 2012 mac mini has upgradable ram
[21:48:09] <Diablo-D3> I have a late 2012 mbpr 13", was not the first model to do it
[21:48:12] <Miles8of9> i know it had upgradable ram, years ago
[21:48:18] <Diablo-D3> mac minis are always late on changes
[21:48:21] <bomb> you don't need to upgrade M1's ram because it's very fast
[21:48:25] <DevJohnC> I think my intel mac mini has upgradable RAM
[21:48:37] <Diablo-D3> and 16gb honestly is enough, stop with the weird obsession with ram in non-servers
[21:48:56] <DevJohnC> 16GB isn't enough for dev on macOS
[21:49:04] <jonp> Diablo-D3: blame Electron? HHOS
[21:49:05] <Diablo-D3> yeah, but why would you dev on macos?
[21:49:08] <redoc> or if you are a VM wh00re
[21:49:13] <jonp> my dev machine is currently using 52GB of ram
[21:49:17] <redoc> Diablo-D3: majority do
[21:49:18] <Miles8of9> it feels so good to have 64 Gb of ram...!! :D
[21:49:20] <jonp> and i don't have any VM running
[21:49:24] <Diablo-D3> redoc: I dont know anyone that does it
[21:49:34] <DevJohnC> if I run AppCode and IntelliJ at the same time I hit memory limit real fast
[21:49:34] <Diablo-D3> they have a mac purely as a build box for code signing
[21:49:34] <redoc> Diablo-D3: read up 😄
[21:49:39] <jonp> lol; "Code Helper (Renderer)" is consuming 2.27GB
[21:49:42] <jonp> wee!
[21:49:44] <DevJohnC> and that's without booting up Xcode to edit a UI
[21:50:00] <Diablo-D3> I suggest you actually get a real OS to dev on, and put the child's toys away
[21:50:10] <DevJohnC> riiiight
[21:50:20] <redoc> I use macOS to write Xamarin forms apps, its just so much easier
[21:50:43] <jonp> i use macOS
[21:50:58] <DevJohnC> I use macOS and Windows both
[21:51:05] <redoc> Diablo-D3: i normally dev on Windows ME, but I haven't been getting updates lately for some reason
[21:51:12] <DevJohnC> my current contracts are for macOS products so I'm using it a lot more lately
[21:51:15] <DevJohnC> and I find I don't hate it
[21:51:34] <redoc> I don't hate it either
[21:51:37] <redoc> at first i did
[21:52:04] <DevJohnC> I don't know all the productivity secrets yet, the cool keyboard shortcuts and whatnot
[21:52:13] <redoc> but once you get homebrew on it you get a nice package manager and it starts to feel a little like home :))
[21:52:33] <blez`> macos's window management is kinda terrible
[21:52:53] <redoc> DevJohnC: i highly suggest you get Alfred instead of the standard mac search
[21:52:58] <redoc> its great
[21:53:07] <jonp> DevJohnC: embrace Emacs-style keybindings
[21:53:11] <jonp> they work ~everywhere

[22:09:23] <DevJohnC> actually HDMI 2.1 aint bad
[22:09:27] <JakeSays> bomb: might be the 'v' in kvm that is the clue
[22:09:35] <DevJohnC> DP does daisy chaining though
[22:09:42] <bomb> because KM would sound dumb
[22:09:55] <DevJohnC> and USB data/power
[22:10:17] <xsperry> do standalone kvms support thunderbolt connection? single cable from to kvm, to share desktop PC's keyboard, mouse and monitor
[22:10:25] <JakeSays> i'm using display port on one monitor and hdmi on the other and can't tell the difference
[22:10:25] <xsperry> single cable from laptop*
[22:10:36] <bomb> because they're the same
[22:10:40] <bomb> one has audio one doesn't
[22:10:57] <DevJohnC> xsperry, afaik you'd need two docks and a KVM connected to them
[22:11:11] <bomb> actually DP has audio too, right
[22:11:23] <DevJohnC> bomb, yeah but so does HDMI
[22:11:49] <xsperry> it works with kvm built into my monitor, just a single cable coming from laptop for everything
