[08:08:49] <ajak> if you're using pulse or pipewire i'd recommend pulsemixer
[08:08:53] <ajak> for alsa, alsamixer
[08:08:54] <Guest83> I have been running room to room but no one seems to know. After my hard drive crashed I lost my volume software. I feel stupid right now ha
[08:08:56] <synaps3> vlc can go up to 200% ?
[08:09:37] <Guest83> alsamixer is an excellent option. But I am curious I was using this one software that let me individually increase the volumes per program I had open
[08:09:52] <Guest83> I would be able to increase firefox or whatever

[08:13:18] <Guest83> ;)
[08:14:00] <ajak> i'm a bit confused why you need things so loud though
[08:14:11] <ajak> is there no knob on the other end?
[08:14:13] <Guest83> Ear drums blown out
[08:14:26] <Guest83> Can't ever hear the same anymore
[08:14:34] <ajak> hearing aids?
[08:14:43] <Guest83> Kicked in the head
[08:14:51] <Guest83> I can still hear haha
[08:15:00] <Guest83> I just need things to be slightly louder.
[08:15:08] <ajak> sure that's what hearing aids are for
[08:15:11] <ajak> they aid your hearing ;)
[08:15:37] <Guest83> Ha that is true. But why use that if its not necessary? Lets hope I do not get THAT bad ha..
[08:15:49] <Guest83> Maybe when I am old

[18:28:54] <AkechiShiro> Hi, does anyone has specific information on the Magento2 CVEs (CVE-2022-2408{6,7}) and a known way to test these CVEs ?
[18:29:13] <AkechiShiro> I'm also curious about Docker Forensics, how should the memory of a Docker container be dumped ?
[18:35:06] <MadCamel> on linux docker containers are just processes running in a semi-isolated kernel context. just find the pids of processes running in the container and dump their memory with gdb
[18:37:18] <AkechiShiro> MadCamel: I found online that, docker checkpoint (experimental) command could be used in order to freeze the container, and be able to restore it afterwards
[18:38:06] <ajak> do you really need to do this with docker tooling?
[18:38:53] <AkechiShiro> ajak: No not really, using gdb to dump the memory is better in a certain way ?
[18:39:08] <ajak> i would say it's better in that it's more generic, sure
