[02:58:17] <gwern> gets me out of the house
[02:58:27] <gwern> and as a dune fan, I need to watch it to have an opinion
[02:59:48] <kuudes> is it 3d and if it is, how well do 3d glasses work with n100 etc?
[03:00:25] <gwern> it is post-processed 3d so not much point in it
[03:02:00] <ivan> I guess you will like it (80%) because you're a fan and also halo effect of big screen and sound
[03:02:46] <kuudes> ah, ok, so 2d is sort of as good
[03:03:09] <adiabatic> if I were you'd I'd buy a big-screen TV for the house and watch it there
[03:03:13] <kuudes> meh. I would like to go to movies but we are now in the "get infected!" phase I suppose
[03:03:42] <kuudes> adiabatic, hmm? so it is out for tv? or do you imply warezing?
[03:04:25] <adiabatic> kuudes: I could've sworn there was a thing in the App Store saying it's available for HBO Go or whatever here in the States
[03:06:00] <kuudes> nice :)
[03:06:28] <adiabatic> goggles+n100 does NOT sound like a fun time
[03:06:32] <adiabatic> and you're there to have fun
[03:06:36] <kuudes> indeed
[03:08:23] <kuudes> btw has anyone run into any reasonable narrative that one should try to infect oneself after getting vaccinated in order to get it solved or something?
[03:08:49] <kuudes> it feels to me that currently our main vaccinologist could be trying to do such, but I don't feel I get it
[03:10:39] <PlanckWalk> Infection with live virus doesn't seem to confer any better immunity than vaccines, and possibly worse.
[03:11:02] <PlanckWalk> (The side effects are definitely worse)
[03:13:14] <saturn2> maybe they are saying that to help people accept the new normal
[03:13:51] <kuudes> they are not saying such, but they are preventing people to get second or third vaccine doses
[03:15:01] <kuudes> it seems a bit similar to usa where fda/cdc are much more stingier than executive with the vaccine doses
[03:15:44] <kuudes> which seems weird to me
[03:16:13] <kuudes> given the vaccine has been found safe and we have extra doses laying around, it seems odd to specifically oppose more doses
[03:16:51] <kuudes> ie the most recent hassle was that we got covid passport. but people who have got covid have been eligible only to 1 dose of vaccine per the quidelines
[03:17:27] <kuudes> and the health institute opposed recommending cities to allow vaccinating those people with second dose just so that they could get the covid passport
[03:17:52] <kuudes> and instead wanted to try to negotiate in eu that this should be acceptable for the eu covid certificate
[03:18:37] <kuudes> the health ministry got them to relent late this week though, and now the recommendation is "it is allowed to get second dose even if the person has had covid, even though they are not medically entitled to second dose"
[03:19:03] <kuudes> and they have sort of been sanish in the past, so I wonder what I am missing. this feels odd to me
[03:19:08] <ggreer> dune was fine. it followed the book closely enough. the gender flip for dr kynes was unnecessary though
[03:19:08] <saturn2> here they were saying they wanted to deny more doses because it would be unfair to the third world
[03:19:34] <gwern> ggreer: unnecessary perhaps but did it make it any worse?
[03:19:39] <kuudes> yes, that has been in public also over here
[03:20:33] <kuudes> but they are not the ones who decide on sending doses abroad
[03:22:10] <ggreer> it fucks up the bloodlines/relationships of the book, but I don't think anyone cares about that
[03:23:20] <gwern> hm? why couldn't the original kynes have had a daughter as easily as a son?
[03:24:25] <ggreer> in the movie chiani isn't related to dr kynes at all (or if it is, they never mention it)
[03:24:52] <gwern> ah. maybe movie 2... even if it gets dropped, I don't think that was all that important anyway
[03:24:57] <kuudes> I guess I have to head to sleep

[03:25:11] <gwern> certainly I didn't even remember kynes was the father of chani until I looked him up just now
[03:26:09] <ggreer> IIRC, chiani has a lab where she continues some of kyne's ecological research to turn dune into a green planet
[03:26:29] <ggreer> maybe they'll get to that a different way. *shrug*
[03:27:07] * gwern doesn't remember that either. seems like a pretty trivial set of details - surely *far* more interesting and important stuff have been trimmed...
[03:27:40] <ggreer> yeah. I assume they gender flipped it to avoid a #dunesowhite hashtag
[03:28:32] <gwern> seems to've worked, or at least, not failed. there's been some SJWy undertones to all the reviews so far but thank god for that FH quote about 'falling into the hands of a hero' etc
[03:28:33] <ggreer> they also ditched a bunch of harkonnen characterization. they're just depicted as evil for evil's sake
[03:29:05] * gwern thinks he may've been the one to add that to the WP entries... just another example of how WP is the commanding heights of the intellectual economy
[03:29:46] <gwern> (nothing convinces you of the power of WP so much as digging up a key quote, adding it to WP, and watching as 5 years later, it's just something everyone knows about the topic)
[03:31:18] <quanticle> I remembered, but it's definitely not important to the plot. It comes in a very minor way when they learn that Kynes is dead, but other than that it's never mentioned again.
[03:34:42] <quanticle> ggreer: Vladimir Harkonnen is pretty much just evil for evil's sake in the book, isn't he? Piter, his Mentat is a sadist who grifts off Vladimir because Vladimir gives him women to torture. Feyd Rautha is an sociopath but he's at least self aware enough to know that House Harkonnen is a declining power and has some ideas about what to do about it.
[03:35:33] <quanticle> But all the same, portraying Harkonnen as evil for evil's sake is, IMO, all right because the book goes out of its way to lampshade how incompetent and stupid the Harkonnens are when they rule Arrakis
[03:36:18] <quanticle> To the point where eventually the Emperor sends Count Fenring to investigate whether the apparent incompetence is a front for treachery.
[03:39:20] <gwern> yeah, there's not really a lot to be said in the harkonnens' defense. even when the baron comes back as a memory, he's still self-sabotagingly evil
[03:40:09] <gwern> herbert was trying to present them as a kind of antithesis to the atreides thesis, which the BG were bringing together for the ideal, but he didn't do a good job of giving the antithesis any good points
[03:40:40] <gwern> you're left wondering why the bene gesserit, much less the bene tleilaxu, would ever bother with the harkonnens
[03:41:12] <gwern> they're *supposed* to be awesome and a match for the atreides, a lineage going back to the USSR on old earth breeding the new soviet superman, clashing through the ages... except they're just pieces of shit
[03:41:53] <gwern> you can't even defend them by saying 'well, they defeated the atreides in the end, didn't they?' because paul beats them

[04:54:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The Neoliberal Project works to advance a liberal society by creating a neoliberal identity, facilitating communities to engage with our ideas, producing new media to spread our ideas and programming to debate our ideas. We develop policy proposals, mobilize our network to support those proposals, analyze the policy proposals of others, build relationships with like-minded individuals and groups and establish strong relations
[04:54:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> hips with local, state and federal actors."
[04:56:03] <gwern> so, the global neoliberal conspiracy finally surfaces with a face!
[04:56:22] <rmmh> Dune is good
[04:57:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Someone on that thread asks "so what have you guys actually accomplished" and the dude is like
[04:57:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> "This is a complex thing to measure, because the largest thing we‚Äôre trying to do is to create an ideological movement that captures a lot of people in the long run."
[04:57:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Amazing

[04:58:27] <rmmh> there's a reflex that prevents sharting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectoanal_inhibitory_reflex
[04:58:28] <Robomot> Rectoanal inhibitory reflex - Wikipedia (The rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) (also known as the anal sampling mechanism, anal sampling reflex, rectosphincteric reflex, or anorectal sampling reflex) is a reflex characterized by a transient involuntary relaxation of the internal anal sphincter in response to distention of the rectum.[ ‚Ä¶)
[04:58:35] <gwern> he's not wrong. for a lot of these things, it seems all an organization can do is sit around waiting for a crisis. (how do you think the entire PATRIOT Act materialized in a few days?)
[04:59:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> "More concretely! I think we‚Äôve successfully made ‚Äòadvocate for sensible monetary policy‚Äô the socially accepted elite position. It‚Äôs been a signature issue for us for as long as we‚Äôve existed, and and area few people used to care about. Now both center-right and center-left (and even portions of the further right/left) now advocate for how important Bernanke, Yellen and Powell have been and how important it is to
[04:59:21] <Obormot\Arcturus>  keep them independent and free of partisan politics. Goldbugs are now simply laughed off, and when someone like Elizabeth Warren goes after Jay Powell, the majority of the center-left is jumping to dunk on Warren and defend Powell (who is a fantastic Fed chair and should be reappointed)." ... ok, yes, they're definitely neoliberals...
[05:01:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> "If Eliezer Yudkowsky had spent 30% less time writing the sequences and used that time to shitpost a bunch of solid memes on twitter about the shorter version of the sequences, EA would probably be twice as large as it is now.
[05:01:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is both a joke and directionally true. Twitter and reddit are community building tools and best at creating memes and viral content. I haven‚Äôt really thought this through in any detail, but I wonder if the EA/rationalist obsession with deeply analyzing and debating everything makes them bad at memes."
[05:01:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's rare that I read something this viscerally repulsive
[05:01:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's depressing is that the EA people seem to be taking this guy as having seriously useful things to say, things which they perhaps might or should imitate
[05:02:04] <mst> what. the fuck.
[05:02:10] <gwern> (if you look at successful libertarian initiatives and their history, the first decade or two generally looks like "held some seminars and wrote a bunch of papers" and then the next step is "one of their acolytes happened to be in the nixon administration when a crisis hit and their radical suggestion of "what if we removed this price control" bowled over everyone in the room')
[05:02:52] <mst> gwern: yep, classic way to reach stochastic success
[05:02:54] <gwern> ("can we do that?!" the other nixonites whisper to each other. "I have a well-thought-out paper saying we should!" "oh. well, you're the man with a plan.")
[05:03:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> "What about HPMOR? It seems like a really popular meme (in the broader sense)" "I think it‚Äôs a good proof of concept‚Äîhave something fun that people enjoy as a gateway drug into the group‚Äôs more serious ideas. But simpler reddit/twitter content would work even better‚Äîtheir content is astonishingly viral compared to long works of fan-fiction."

[09:54:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Arcturus doesn't have case fans
[09:54:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Only a CPU fan (which runs extremely quiet) and GPU fan (ditto)
[09:55:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is getting rid of the CPU and GPU fans worth going to these extremes? I do not think so
[09:55:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Better instead to get one of them noise-dampening cases
[09:55:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or mod an existing case to be noise-dampening, as I've done with several of mine)
[09:56:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Not Arcturus's case, because it's unnecessary there, but all of my Smilodon cases are noise-modded)
[09:57:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Needless to say, *all* of the case mods I've made to *all* of my cases cost me less, combined, than this case does by itself)
[09:58:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I mean, this thing doesn't even have carrying handles!)
[09:59:40] <nshepperd2> how can it be the ultimate fanless PC if it doesn't have carrying handles #theodicy
[10:01:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2ocnn0mgbqbr9i1/SAM_1095.jpg?dl=0 ... I mean, look at that. Spring-loaded! Padded!
[10:01:54] <Robomot> image/jpeg (1368x1026; 672 KB)
[10:02:00] <PapuaHardyNet> Obormot: so your suggestion is to start with normie cases and mod them?
[10:02:18] <PapuaHardyNet> (hey, I love that handle)
[10:02:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/kd7pioza3f8mk4f/SAM_1086.jpg?dl=0 ... reinforced, too!
[10:02:34] <Robomot> image/jpeg (1368x1026; 641 KB)
[10:03:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Well, not necessarily. There's some pretty nice "silent" cases out there! If noise reduction is your top priority, you're better of purchasing than modding. The reason I did it this way is that I had cases that were uniquely suited to my needs in *other* ways, and I wanted to add features like noise reduction to them
[10:05:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> It was difficult (but possible) to start with a case design I liked and add noise insulation, carrying handles, other stuff, whereas it would've been impossible to start with a silent case and make it have the design I wanted (because what I wanted had to do with basic structural features/layout)
[10:06:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x4swy8ukb4rm9lu/AADp4300CdFk3rLgfpM08eBxa?dl=0 ... here's the rest of the mods, if you're curious
[10:06:11] <Robomot> Dropbox - Case modding - Simplify your life (Shared with Dropbox)
[10:07:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> The case is a RAIDMAX Smilodon. They haven't made these in many years. It has the extremely rare feature of having *both* side panels fold out (and separate completely, if you like), with the motherboard being mounted on one of said panels
[10:07:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's an exceptionally convenient case to work with; I've got three of them, for that reason
[10:08:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> But if you don't need that, but *do* need very quiet operation, then, as I said, you're better off getting a more modern case designed for silence
[10:09:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Especially since the Smilodon is not great cooling-wise, which is why (as you can see from the photos) I added two additional case fan mount points to mine)
[10:10:34] <PapuaHardyNet> i see, i see
[10:10:49] <adiabatic> silent PC review gave the thumbs-up to a model from Puget Systems and I bought that
[10:10:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fractal Design makes some excellent quiet cases, e.g. https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/define/define-s/black/
[10:10:57] <Robomot> Define S ‚Äî Fractal Design
[10:12:17] <adiabatic> looks a lot like the case for my mom's computer
[10:12:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Incidentally they also make some of the best case fans: https://www.fractal-design.com/products/fans/venturi/
[10:12:58] <Robomot> Venturi ‚Äî Fractal Design (The Venturi Series of fans delivers high quality design and construction with built-in rubber vibration dampening corners coupled with top quality electronics and materials. They are particularly suited for high pressure or high airflow usage scenarios featuring detailed engineered elements that contribute to a low-noise yet high-performing fan.)
[10:16:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> (The other brand of high-quality case fans is Noctua. Don't bother with any other ones)
[10:16:32] <adiabatic> knock on wood, ctrl-f for noctua on https://www.pugetsystems.com/recommended/Recommended-Systems-for-Quiet-Operation-258/Buy_52 and you'll get hits
[10:16:32] <Robomot> Buy Workstations Designed for Quiet Operation in 2021 (Our Recommended Systems for Quiet Operation are application tested and optimized to give you the best performance and reliability. Buy with confidence!)
[10:16:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Makes sense
[10:17:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Heh, in fact they use a Fractal Design chassis and add Noctua fans to it
[10:17:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Seems legit!
[10:17:44] <adiabatic> isn't it great to get your opinions validated?
[10:17:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, I already knew I was right ;)
[10:18:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Fractal Design doesn't ship their cases with their good fans, which is why they don't use the stock fans, if anyone's wondering)
[10:18:32] * quanticle imagines that all of you are living on submarines where the noise of your case fans is the only thing standing between you and a commie torpedo
[10:18:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> (they = these Puget people)
[10:19:31] <adiabatic> quanticle: noise makes me dumber and I'm too dumb for what I want to do already
[10:20:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Totally true
[10:20:31] <adiabatic> also I don't like playing "computer noise or tinnitus" when I'm sitting in my office

[10:20:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol
[10:22:05] <adiabatic> like, right now, osx-cpu-temp -f says 1 and 6 RPM for my fans on my laptop
[10:22:12] <adiabatic> so it's definitely 100% tinnitus
[10:22:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> That sounds like a lie
[10:22:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> MBPs never spin down that much
[10:22:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1 rpm??? It can't even spin at 1 rpm
[10:22:45] <adiabatic> so is it faster or slower
[10:23:02] <quanticle> It's going to be either faster or off
[10:23:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> The correct speed is something like three orders of magnitude faster
[10:23:18] <Obormot\Gaia> Gaia's fans, e.g., are spinning at ~2000rpm right now
[10:23:25] <Obormot\Gaia> That's about as low as they get
[10:23:39] <quanticle> Well, they can also go off completely, can't they?
[10:23:40] <adiabatic> 15" 2015, here
[10:23:45] <Obormot\Gaia> quanticle: no
[10:24:04] <quanticle> Oh? My laptop can shut its fans off if it's not doing anything particulary taxing
[10:24:12] <Obormot\Gaia> MBPs do not do that
[10:24:16] <Obormot\Gaia> adiabatic: Pretty much same, 15" 2014
[10:24:26] <adiabatic> my _next_ laptop will not have fans spinning up for much
[10:24:29] <quanticle> I'm pretty sure that newer macbooks do
[10:24:47] <Obormot\Gaia> Maybe newer ones, but not the ones adiabatic and I have
[10:24:48] <adiabatic> "won't use fans for most day-to-day tasks"
[10:24:52] <quanticle> My work macbook seems to have the same behavior: it'll be completely silent until I kick off a build, and then I'll hear the fans go
[10:25:15] <adiabatic> mine is also completely silent unless I visit the wrong webpage with an animation
[10:25:26] <Obormot\Gaia> quanticle: The thing to understand is that an MBP like Gaia *is* almost silent at 2000rpm
[10:26:30] <Obormot\Gaia> Do not assume your fans are off just because you can't hear them
[10:27:21] <adiabatic> well sure, a fan that rotates once every 10s would be that silent
[10:27:42] <Obormot\Gaia> 2000rpm is much more than once every 10s :p

[14:50:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> It shows with the "meta" icon on GW, but on LW it doesn't seem to be in any way marked as any more "meta" than anything else
[14:51:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> I see I can add a tag, via, LW, e.g. "Site Meta", which I did and then it shows that tag on GW. But the "meta-ness" of the post is still there and still seems epiphenomenal w.r.t. actual LW

[21:57:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Reading this Monotype thing... and, look, I entirely get the concerns. They're all valid... from the perspective of the type designers. But, like... isn't the reason that Monotype *can* do this, just that people increasingly *don't need new fonts*?
[21:58:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> They make most of their money selling old fonts, which... is only a "problem" insofar as the terms on which those fonts get sold are egregiously extractive
[21:59:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that's not really the problem that any of these complaints are addressing
[21:59:16] <gwern> my take is more 'people throw dumb amounts of money at monotype for no good reason and so monotype can sit there fat and happy and not even making new fonts like a non-monopolist designer like h&f did'

[22:00:42] <gwern> which is part of why omagari being fired is so striking
[22:01:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure. I'm just saying that the alternative that the independent type designers are proposing seems to boil down to "instead, throw money at *us*", which is perhaps good to the extent that it's likely to be *less* money, but... the rhetoric about the health of the craft is not justified thereby
[22:01:14] <gwern> he loved the history of monotype, and was doing cool things, and could hardly have cost anything. they fired him anyway to shave costs a little more despite an *80%* gross profit!
[22:01:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> He's better off indie, let's be real here
[22:01:48] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: at least they'd be making new fonts and stuff. god knows what monotype's owners do with it. cocaine and hookers in las vegas at private equity conferences, one assumes
[22:02:08] *** Quits: two2thehead (~user@27.114.132.215) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:02:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> What I'm saying is that "at least they'd be making new fonts and stuff" is a questionable benefit
[22:03:09] <gwern> eh. even a blind font designer will periodically make something useful, like a font for some neglected african language
[22:04:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Most people are like "I want a good font" "What kind of font?" and then the answer is either "we need a bespoke font for our marketing campaign" and then they get one custom-made, or else the answer is "like a Helvetica or some shit, I dunno, like a regular font, a good one, for <the given purpose>" - and there are kajillions of those already
[22:04:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> What is the role of the type designer who's cranking out a new grotesque sans, in that setup?
[22:06:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I agree that there's stuff to do, definitely along the lines of "add X language support", but the ironic thing there is that it would be *vastly* more useful to take an *existing* popular font and add the language support to that, than to go "I am making an entirely new font that is slightly different from the trillion existing fonts like it in ways inscrutable to everyone except the most hardcore typography nerds, oh and by
[22:06:34] <Obormot\Arcturus>  the way it has Amharic support"
[22:07:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> If anything, this whole scenario is an argument for open-source font projects, much more so than it's an argument for saving the indie type designers or w/e
[22:07:50] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: oh, yeah, they got rid of the separate meta section
[22:08:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I guess the "is it a meta post" field is still in the db though? And that's how come GW is still capable of creating "meta" posts and showing posts as "meta" etc.?
[22:10:22] <saturn2> yeah, they never removed that field, probably to avoid breaking GW
[22:10:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Probably ought to remove the option from the selector in the editor
[22:11:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Although, re: licensing terms, designers like Butterick can certainly claim that they provide a superior product specifically in the sense that if you buy e.g. Triplicate or w/e, you only pay once and have it forever (subject to license terms, which then there's various options for), rather than "you're beholden to Monotype forever and if you stop paying, now you can't legally use any fonts anymore"
[22:11:43] <saturn2> i thought i removed everything about it but evidently i forgot that part
[22:12:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: (But again that's almost entirely disjoint from the complaints actually cited in that article)
[22:13:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well. At least Adobe's still doing good work, right
[22:14:07] <gwern> I dunno. I don't have a good impression of how much font work they do vs resources available vs revenue
[22:14:25] <gwern> no headline number like '80% gross profit' where you know instantly something has gone horribly wrong
[22:14:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, it's a lot harder to judge in their case anyway
[22:15:03] <gwern> I am sure there are numbers for adobe but they are not a pure play
[22:15:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not analogous to Monotype since Adobe isn't a font company exclusively
[22:15:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Still, it's hard to imagine Monotype doing anything like the Source * Pro projects
[22:17:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Of course there's also Google Fonts. But who would ever claim that they're contributing to the health of the type design craft?)

[23:34:51] <Robomot> Coughs and sneezes don‚Äôt ‚Äúget rid of viruses‚Äù | UCL News - UCL ‚Äì University College London (The belief that coughing or sneezing is a way of ejecting viruses is conjecture, and ‚Äúit seems more likely that respiratory viruses‚Ä¶ have evolved to make us cough and sneeze to transmit the virus in an effective way,‚Äù says Professor Greg Towers (UCL Infection & Immunity).)
[23:35:04] <[itchyjunk]> Closest thing i can find supporting that virus makes us sneeze is some doctor saying so in an email
[23:36:24] <Gurkenglas> then why do we sneeze as an allergic reaction
[23:37:25] <gwern> expel the stuff entering our nose then and there?
[23:37:40] <gwern> also all those bugs that keep trying to go up your nose
[23:38:21] <Gurkenglas> ...i may be sneezing wrong. I'm pretty sure when I sneeze stuff comes out my mouth, not my nose.
[23:40:55] <[itchyjunk]> "The researchers then looked for molecules ‚Äî called neuropeptides ‚Äî that could transmit sneeze signals to those nerve cells, and found that a molecule called neuromedin B (NMB) was required for sneezing."

[23:41:19] <feepbot> What makes us sneeze? ‚Äì Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (Molecules, nerve cells in brain trigger sneezes; understanding may point to ways to quell spread of infectious viruses)
[23:44:18] <Gurkenglas> *looks at a video* ah, differs per person. well, it can both be true that sneezing helps remove viruses from the body and that viruses deliberately behave in ways that make us sneeze.

[23:45:28] <Gurkenglas> the human body might even, like, advertise that it's about to sneeze and where the viruses are to gather in order to leave, in order to make use of the aligned incentives there.
[23:50:00] <gwern> (I'm not sure viruses can credibly cooperate like that, and inclusive fitness strongly militates against selling out your relatives like that)
[23:51:19] <Gurkenglas> the virus doesn't need to be trusted, it only needs to trust.
[23:51:39] <gwern> but then it could just rush to the nose first
[23:52:28] <[itchyjunk]> So its unclear if virus have evolved to make us sneeze? just the ones that spread via sneezing got selected for ?
[23:53:02] <Gurkenglas> it does need to replicate first, but once it has grown as far as it will get before the immune system is ready to slaughter it, then is the time for conditional surrender.
[23:53:28] <Gurkenglas> and wouldn't relatives usually already be infected by that time?
[23:53:44] <gwern> no. most relatives won't be infected at all unless the R is crazy high
[23:56:58] <Gurkenglas> Maybe the average infection happens during a plague, when everyone probably gets infected anyway?
[23:58:00] <Gurkenglas> (but my theory's on the back foot here.)
[23:58:59] <[itchyjunk]> So we don't really know if i sneeze because free will or because a virus took over some of my nerves in some sense.
