[16:54:05] <sokan> http://ix.io/3U0o <--- my code. http://ix.io/3U0p<---- ACE2_HUMAN.txt file I'm trying to edit to a new file. I don't get what I'm doing wrong with declaring $seq. Because I'm oding something horribly wrong.
[16:55:59] <Botje> is the answer "not using bioperl"?
[16:56:21] <sokan> Use of uninitialized value $seq in concatenation (.) or string at uprot2fasta.pl line 42 (and 44). I don't get how to fix that issue :/ How do I initialize $seq?
[16:56:28] *** schro is now known as schrodinger
[16:56:36] <sokan> Botje: if only. It's an assignment and we haven't been taught bioperl... Sadly...
[16:56:49] <Botje> sokan: your while loop reads one line at a time
[16:57:14] <Altreus> my $seq = ''; # seems like it should be a string, so you should start with the empty string
[16:57:15] <sokan> but . concatenates no?
[16:58:03] <Botje> sokan: restructure your application.
[16:59:16] <Botje> sokan: you need to test if you read a line that starts with SQ
[16:59:26] <Botje> sokan: and then *read more* until you see (I guess) that // marker
[16:59:52] <Botje> sokan: you already know how to test for the SQ marker
[17:00:05] <Botje> sokan: so then it is a matter of reading from <IN> until you see //
[17:00:08] <Botje> *OR*
[17:00:23] <Botje> you set $/ to "//" and a single readline call will get you everything up to that marker
[17:01:09] <Botje> the second case is a nice oneliner: my $seq = do { local $/ = "//"; <IN> }; chomp($seq); $seq =~ s/\s+//g
[17:02:09] <sokan> https://l.perl.bot/raw/qjugvx <--- So with this loop I don't get anything read out. 
[17:02:16] <sokan> I presume that this means that something is not read right
[17:02:55] <Botje> sokan: the computer does what you tell it to.
[17:03:02] <Botje> "read stuff from the file" is <IN>
[17:03:16] <Botje> the code you pasted does not contain <IN>, so you're chewing the same line over and over.
[17:03:24] <sokan> sec
[17:03:28] <sokan> will paste the whole thing again
[17:04:33] <sokan> Botje: http://ix.io/3U0s
[17:04:49] <Botje> that's just the original again.

[19:07:10] <PapaChub> Is there a more idiomatic way to do: `if (!condition) { warn "Zero iterations" }; while (condition) { ... }`  (Short of setting a `$seen` flag, etc.)
[19:07:10] <PapaChub> I'm imagining a syntax like: `while (condition) { ... } else { warn "Zero" }`
[19:08:12] <LeoNerd> No; we don't have while/else. (It's an icky reuse of a keyword, in my opinion)
[19:08:33] <LeoNerd> I have sometimes wanted an optional block on loops that only executes if the loop body didn't even run once, but I don't feel that "else" is the right word for it
[19:08:37] <LeoNerd> It wants some other word
[19:08:42] <PapaChub> `otherwise`
[19:08:56] <LeoNerd> Yeah, that's possibly a nicer word
[19:09:17] <thrig> do errors drop into that block, or ... ?
[19:09:55] <LeoNerd> My thinking is that while/until/foreach loops with an "otherwise" block would only execute the otherwise if the loop body did not run -at all-
[19:10:32] <LeoNerd> Effectively equivalent to  my $disarm; foreach(THINGS) { $disarm++; BODY }  if(!$disarm) { OTHERWISE }
[19:11:40] <LeoNerd> It's quite nice on foreach loops that print a list of things, for example; so you can   foreach my $thing (@things) { say "A thing: $thing"; } otherwise { say "No things at all, sorry"; }
[19:14:58] <PapaChub> `DO_STUFF while CONDITION otherwise BAIL;` ?
