[10:59:46] *** Joins: YIChen (~user@58.210.85.58)
[11:00:01] <ville> even under x programs can only request something to be done to their frame, but ultimately the wm may ignore any such request
[11:00:03] <gabin> maybe emacs can detect the current window position
[11:00:15] <gabin> i don't know if it can be notified though
[11:00:28] <gabin> but maybe you can set a keybinding to put it back when you notice
[11:00:45] <ville> and do what with that? try to reposition it self? that wouldn't do much if the wm doesn't respect any such request
[11:01:21] <str1ngs> think best emacs can do is maximize and minimize and close
[11:01:22] <gabin> why is the window manager even moving/resizing the frame?
[11:01:37] <ville> that is a wm's job
[11:01:40] *** nocoiner is now known as taliban
[11:01:43] <gabin> i've been able to control frame size and position in emacs before
[11:01:45] <str1ngs> because frames are windows
[11:01:45] *** taliban is now known as normalperson
[11:02:02] <gabin> do it frequently on windows
[11:02:23] <ville> gabin: yes you can if your wm/environment respects the request. but in the end all they are is request
[11:02:37] <str1ngs> try moving a ncurses frame :P
[11:03:05] <kiki_lamb> gabin: os x seems to like to move windows sometime if they extend under where the menu bar un-hides or if they extend past the screen
[11:03:08] <gabin> kiki_lamb: in what sense is macos moving/resizing your emacs without your wish?
[11:03:18] <gabin> ah
[11:03:42] <kiki_lamb> makes it tough to have a window stay where it is if it's full height, from the top of the screen to the bottom
[11:03:50] <gabin> i think i've only seen macos move/resize windows when i hide/unhide the dock
[11:03:50] <ville> kiki_lamb: no idea if macos allows 3rd party wm or wm-like utility
[11:04:06] <gabin> are your hiding/unhiding the menu bar?
[11:04:13] <kiki_lamb> so, if i can't lock it i guess my best bet is to figure out how to call set-frame-position on a timer every few seconds
[11:04:25] <ville> sounds horrible
[11:04:31] <gabin> ville: there are several wms for macos
[11:04:31] <kiki_lamb> gabin: yeah, it's set to auto hide. i don't like cluttered layouts.

[11:06:16] <kiki_lamb> ville: hrm, i'm gonna try not to first... a whole new WM seems like overkill just to keep a window in one place, if I can find a way to avoid it that's probably better.

[11:07:02] <kiki_lamb> getting emacs to just reposition itself back to the right spot on a timer might work, looking up how to use timers.
[11:07:09] <parsnip> kiki_lamb: if the dock and menu bar are always hidden, why would macos resize any windows?
[11:07:18] <ville> kiki_lamb: well the macos default wm was horrible to begin with so it would be the first thing i'd look at
[11:07:41] <kiki_lamb> parsnip: good question.
[11:07:47] <parsnip> my floating window manager bindings work within the default macos wm
[11:08:05] <ville> kiki_lamb: because if you find a good wm then you get good way to manage all your windows not just emacs
[11:08:25] <parsnip> i use karabiner-elements and hammerspoon
[11:08:36] <parsnip> capslock+h moves window to left, etc
[11:08:54] <parsnip> capslock+d toggles hiding the dock
[11:09:10] <parsnip> capslock+D cycles the dock to the three locations for the dock
[11:09:17] <kiki_lamb> ville: eh, i don't really mind the default WM, other than some tiny quirks like this it suits my purposes well.

[11:49:37] <codingquark> I once tried carrying the backpack I have had for years, and did not like it. I switched to carrying water bottle and going for cycling at dedicated times
[11:49:41] <parsnip> i picked up a nice smallish sports backpack, less surface area, mostly to ride bike to gym with flip-flops, etc
[11:50:24] <codingquark> parsnip: how much do you ride on a normal day?
[11:51:01] <parsnip> but yeah, i'm looking for solutions for longer rides. i'll probably get another pannier rack, and look for a small pannier bag with convenient opening access
[11:51:27] <parsnip> i avoid long rides for now, since the bike isn't high quality, but also because i'm still just using the backpack
[11:51:39] <codingquark> Hmm, this guy Thomas Frank showed off a nice pannier on youtube recently
[11:51:45] <codingquark> Want link to the video?
[11:51:52] <parsnip> what pushed me to get the second bike finally was wanting to make quick trips to go to the gym
[11:52:19] <parsnip> i have a roll top ortlieb, it will probably be fine
[11:52:44] <parsnip> i wish collapsible panniers were more of a thing
[11:52:50] <codingquark> I don't even have a helmet :(
[11:53:05] <parsnip> i would like to put my backpack in a collapsible pannier, then when i get off bike, stuff the pannier in my backpack
[11:53:18] <codingquark> That is a good idea
[11:53:28] <parsnip> i don't have a helmet yet, but i ride super careful now, often slow and/or on sidewalk
[11:53:49] <codingquark> I ride on a 4-lane highway :-P

[18:06:22] <lisp123> What's the method now?
[18:06:22] <repetitivestrain> instead, set lexical-binding to t (see command elisp-enable-lexical-binding) and use regular let
[18:06:55] <repetitivestrain> as of Emacs 24.1, emacs lisp has native support for lexical binding. just set the file-local variable `lexical-binding' to t, and use regular let
[18:06:57] <wasamasa> you put a file-local variable in the first line

[18:07:28] <sachac> lisp123: I wonder if looking at ace-jump's source code might be useful for you
[18:07:28] <wasamasa> oh, lexical binding is needed because of the lambda commands

[18:07:38] <wasamasa> lisp123: if it does interfere, the code needs to be fixed
[18:07:48] <wasamasa> lisp123: because it does rely on dynamic binding without declaring that properly
[18:07:59] <sachac> lisp123: since it dynamically makes shortcuts
[18:08:15] <lisp123> sachac: Thanks, I will have a look at ace-jump

[18:08:56] <lisp123> wasamasa: Thanks, so I need to use file local lexical binding and then declare dynamic variables properly
[18:09:02] <wasamasa> yeah
[18:09:12] <wasamasa> all defvars are dynamic
[18:09:22] <lisp123> All the global variables that one frequently accesses - that's fine right? As long as there is no local variable that shadows it?
