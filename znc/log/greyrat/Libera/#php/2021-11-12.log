[00:14:48] <AllenJB> bogdaniel: Your sandbox shows days as 19 and 13, which is 32 total for me.
[00:15:01] <AllenJB> I would however recommend you avoid date math based on timestamps. Also double-check the timezone being used by date() (Or better yet, avoid using it and stick to DateTime objects with explicit timezone - see also DateTime::createFromFormat)
[00:15:02] <AllenJB> Use DateTime's ->modify() or ->add(DateInterval) methods. Also note that DateTime values are comparable uses <, >, etc
[00:15:16] <AllenJB> *comparable using
[00:16:37] <bogdaniel> AllenJB well I found the damn bug in it and the 19 & 13 were ok because I started from 0 on total days if you check it instead of
[00:16:39] <bogdaniel> 1
[00:18:23] <bogdaniel> AllenJB why isn't ok to do math using timestamps ?
[00:21:04] <AllenJB> Because it has a bad habit of going wonky around DST changes. Also, DateTime's methods are easier to read and you don't have to store magic numbers in your head
[00:28:07] <bogdaniel> ohh true
[00:28:09] <bogdaniel> got it
[00:28:35] <bogdaniel> well in this case should be fine with everything

[13:14:57] <The_Blode> Good morning guys. I've been programming with core PHP for about 4 years and I have a personal application which I run that logs different types of tasks that I perform.
[13:15:09] <The_Blode> Now, I really really want to use and learn a PHP framework.
[13:15:11] *** Joins: delboy1978uk (~delboy197@109.132.42.202)
[13:15:24] <The_Blode> Any suggestions on which one might be good to know and somewhat easy to pick up?
[13:15:26] <The_Blode> Thanks in advance.
[13:15:56] *** Quits: Xavier7 (~O_o@179.6.138.143) (Quit:  IRcap  8.72 )
[13:16:22] <Naktibalda> The_Blode: what are you going to use it for?
[13:16:53] <deksar> Is "upload_max_size" a wrong term/value? It seems this doesn't even exist on PHP.
[13:17:52] *** Quits: Atlas (~atlas@user/atlas) (Quit: My MacBook Air has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[13:18:08] <AllenJB> deksar: There's 2 directives: post_max_size and upload_max_filesize. The former must be larger than the latter. See https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.post-max-size
[13:18:39] <deksar> I specifically meant "upload_max_size" term, as a WordPress plugin contains it forcing through "ini_set"
[13:18:53] <deksar> but thanks AllenJB for such great tips.
[13:18:57] <The_Blode> Well, for my application. It's a task logging application.
[13:19:06] <The_Blode> So I have 500 odd tasks I do and I log each one of them.
[13:19:10] <The_Blode> But the tasks vary.
[13:19:55] <The_Blode> In the current version which is handwritten in CorePHP has a massive case switch statement of 500 conditions...each one for a different task.
[13:20:03] <The_Blode> But I know a framework would reduce the codebase here
[13:20:24] <Naktibalda> what does that switch doo?
[13:20:26] <Naktibalda> do
[13:21:54] <AllenJB> deksar: upload_max_size is not a standard PHP ini directive. It's possible that some extension or PHP code could use it I guess - as far as I know it's possible to set any ini value using ini_set() - it's just that PHP won't pay attention to any it doesn't know.
[13:22:09] <The_Blode> Depending on the input task (from the frontend) it will determine which "task log type" to log
[13:22:45] <The_Blode> For example, drinking tea will follow one case, eating lunch another
[13:22:51] <The_Blode> And the tasks are varied in scope
[13:23:55] <The_Blode> Some tasks have similar logging styles, some have some variances. For example, drinking tea has additional properties (how much tea), and eating lunch (what did you eat and how many calories)

[14:56:53] <deksar> The above lines are my configuration. However, found out that, an active WordPress plugin has these lines within its php file, though: ini_set( 'memory_limit', '2048M' ); - ini_set( 'upload_max_size', '150M' ); - ini_set( 'post_max_size', '128M' ); - ini_set( 'max_execution_time', '600' ); I think there is no such "upload_max_size" thing in PHP, and secondly; shouldn't upload_max_size be less than post_max_size? They had that mistake too - it seems.
[14:56:54] <biberu> deksar: you have http requests that need to run for up to 10 minutes(!) and upload half a gigabyte?
[14:57:59] <biberu> and you're allowing 163 processes using up to 2GB of memory each?
[14:58:06] <deksar> biberu: Exactly, well, once when we were importing a very heavy WordPress database (.xml) through WordPress dashboard - yes, now; not at all. I will decrease those values. Any "general" suggestions for a busy WordPress blog? Would be much welcome.
[14:58:45] <deksar> biberu: Well, max_children - yes. But per size? How have you calculated they're using 2 GB each?
[14:58:54] <biberu> ini_set( 'memory_limit', '2048M' );
[14:58:59] <deksar> I see...
[14:59:25] <deksar> So that's being overridden.. naughty plugin.
[14:59:36] <deksar> But would that cause memory/swap full-ness?
[14:59:42] <biberu> ofc they may use less, but setting it that high indicates that someone needs it
[15:00:09] <deksar> biberu: Just created a support ticket (a paid plugin) and asked an answer for that^

[17:07:51] <Blondie101010> the only sane way is to do it like I said, with HTTP auth
[17:08:04] <__adrian> ^
[17:08:20] <stenno> wait is it though?
[17:08:40] <Blondie101010> yes, alternatives would involve having PHP scripts serving the images
[17:08:44] <Blondie101010> that would be inefficient
[17:08:56] <stenno> yes
[17:09:13] *** Quits: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[17:09:29] <stenno> well its slightly less efficient, but then you can at least use your php sessions
[17:09:57] <Blondie101010> you asked the question and yet don't care about the answerr
[17:10:34] <Blondie101010> it makes a big difference, but of course you won't notice it if you only have 2 users per hour
[17:10:52] <stenno> i do care about the answer, thats why i asked
[17:11:06] <stenno> oh wasn't aware that relipse maintains a high traffic page

[17:11:24] *** Joins: jetchisel (jetchisel@user/jetchisel)
[17:11:40] <stenno> the question is if its inefficient enough to make it a non-viable solution
[17:11:45] <__adrian> it's the better solution regardless - high traffic just means you notice it
[17:11:48] <Blondie101010> it's also easier to do it properly

[21:57:38] <gizmore> yeah.. 6.10.7 will fix it
[21:57:46] <gizmore> maybe
[21:57:46] <da_wunder> those tools has nothing to do with what I said
[21:58:03] <da_wunder> just use eg. ecs tool for that
[21:58:22] <da_wunder> also where are the tests?
[21:59:04] <gizmore> every module comes with its own tests.... the core tests are bad, and there is a special gdo6-tests module, which runs auto-generated tests on each module
[21:59:14] <gizmore> i do not much testint tho
[21:59:22] <gizmore> i rely on mailOnError
[21:59:41] <da_wunder> without tests refactoring code will be hard

[22:02:17] <gizmore> 7.4?
[22:02:20] <gizmore> or 8.0?
[22:03:07] <da_wunder> those are not required - you should just add those so that your code fails if/when someone is trying to pass eg. int value to string parameter
[22:03:21] <da_wunder> and also add declare(strict_types = 1);
[22:04:28] <gizmore> thx!
[22:04:35] <gizmore> where do i declare strict types?

[22:05:03] <gizmore> ouch
[22:05:07] <gizmore> that's bullocks

[22:05:37] <da_wunder> find + replace in files - should do that in couple of seconds
[22:06:07] <da_wunder> and really if you don't add declare definition people can pass integers to string parameters and so on
