[14:03:20] * Bunny351 tried plasma on the pinephone once and it was total crap
[14:04:03] * sjamaan finally received his Librem 5 a while ago and it was total crap
[14:04:19] <Bunny351> really?
[14:05:00] <sjamaan> yeah
[14:05:12] <Bunny351> hardware, software or both?
[14:05:23] <sjamaan> Software mostly
[14:05:33] <sjamaan> The hardware is on the bulky side but I can live with that
[14:05:48] <sjamaan> But it's the integration with the hardware where it sucks hardest
[14:06:35] <Bunny351> with some cobbled together scripts I could make the pinephone sort-of-usable, but it's rather brittle
[14:06:54] <sjamaan> Camera can't take pictures worth shit (light exposure is not handled properly), phone call microphone is horrible, battery drains fast (and initially doesn't even want to charge unless you shake some bones at full moon)
[14:07:06] <Bunny351> ugh
[14:07:18] <sjamaan> It can't read phone numbers from the SIM card (unless you're willing to script minicom yourself)
[14:07:19] <Bunny351> I'm just happy the pp works at all
[14:07:39] <zilti[m]> Yea the pinephone is/was kinda crap
[14:07:49] <Bunny351> but it's cheap enough to give it a try
[14:08:04] <sjamaan> Oh, and the promised Matrix support they were touting is simply not there
[14:08:09] <Bunny351> and I haven't given up yet on trying to write a usable UI for it
[14:08:11] <sjamaan> (that's just software)
[14:09:20] <zilti[m]> I did get it. It had Gnome Mobile on it per default, which is so utterly broken that I thought the phone's broken. Once I got Plasma running, it was at least working somewhat
[14:09:21] <Bunny351> I rather use a clunky pp than any locked-in surveillance OS. and I can code it myself
[14:09:38] <sjamaan> I went back to my dumbphone
[14:09:40] <Bunny351> plasma was slow and buggy for me
[14:09:52] <sjamaan> It's shitty but at least not riddled with obnoxious spyware
[14:09:59] <Bunny351> sxmo works, but it's a terrible mess and of course absolutely not user friendly
[14:10:16] <sjamaan> What's sxmo?
[14:10:29] <Bunny351> dwm + dmenu - shell scripts
[14:10:39] <Bunny351> a "desktop environment" for pinephone
[14:10:45] <sjamaan> heh
[14:11:00] <Bunny351> very cool, crappy, but cool... :-)
[14:11:27] <Bunny351> https://sxmo.org/
[14:12:31] <Bunny351> but don't look at the code, your eyes will bleed

[20:42:42] <Bunny351> one shouldn't read papers by Carl Hewitt...
[20:44:18] <jcowan> No.  They are incompreincompreincomprehensiblehensiblehensible.
[20:46:02] <Bunny351> but what I learned was that Papert was involved not only in discreding neuronal network research, but also doing the same by discrediting logic programming research in edinburgh
[20:46:55] <Bunny351> (only assuming what hewitt writes/cited is true, one can never be sure...)
[20:48:05] <Zipheir> Seymour Papert of Mindstorms fame?
[20:48:10] <Bunny351> yep
[20:48:12] <Zipheir> Weird.
[20:48:31] <Bunny351> not the nice bearded uncle he looks like... :-)
[20:48:55] <Bunny351> well, that is the whole US LISP tradition, naturally they saw everything different as inferior
[20:49:51] <Bunny351> "smug lisp weenies", there is a reason for this term
[20:51:37] <Bunny351> the amount of elaborate scholastics that can be found in certain discussions in lisp communities, that tries to give deep, cosmological meaning to ad-hoc features slammed together by MIT LISP hackers back in the day, hilarious.
[20:51:47] <Zipheir> I suppose that explains a bit of why most logic programming research happened outside of the US.
[20:52:14] <Bunny351> yeah, I guess so. Winograd did SHRDLU, which was awesome, but then it ended
[20:52:44] <Corbin> I'm an expert in debunking Hewitt, if you need anything translated. Can't believe that he *still* thinks actors and lambdas are meaningfully different.
[20:52:54] <Bunny351> (well, Planner was sort-of-logic programming, IIUC, I'm still not sure whether I understood correctly (hewitt paper))
[20:53:03] <dstolfa> Corbin: carl hewitt?
[20:53:25] <dstolfa> if so, OH GOD NO WHY BAD MEMORIES
[20:53:33] <dstolfa> that guy is insufferable
[20:53:54] <Bunny351> I have heard several things like this, what happened to that man? sojme sort of Stephen Wolfram syndrome?
[20:54:32] <dstolfa> Bunny351: other than making extremely transphobic remarks in his talks, he says a bunch of nonsense in them while trying to live on old fame and being banned from wikipedia for vandalising things
[20:54:32] <Corbin> Yeah, or Ted Nelson. Same sort of lots-of-ideas, no-prototyping personality.
[20:54:59] <Bunny351> ah, ok
[20:55:11] <Corbin> In one of the original Scheme lambda papers, I found a footnote from the 1970s explaining that actors are just lambdas, and complaining about Hewitt. I have to admire not just being a crank, but being a lifelong crank.
[20:55:23] <Bunny351> Ted Nelson at least is funny/weird in his embittered ranting
[20:56:18] <Corbin> dstolfa: Aw, that's not good. Last time I talked to Hewitt, he was very much in kindly-old-granddad mode, and I was hoping that maybe he'd chilled out a bit. But saying transphobic things is pretty common for granddads, I guess.
[20:57:18] <dstolfa> Corbin: while talking about A /\ ~A being true, he made a remark that it's "like his trans friends who can't figure out of they're a man or woman"
[20:57:56] <Bunny351> well, we don't know anything about his trans friends.
[20:58:15] <Bunny351> perhaps their actors...
[20:58:16] * Bunny351 runs
[20:58:20] <dstolfa> lol
[20:58:24] <Bunny351> they are, dammit
[20:58:30] <Bunny351> vandusen: CANT TYPE
[20:58:33] <vandusen> Bunny351: BALONEY, I say.  Baloney!
[20:58:52] <Corbin> dstolfa: Ugh, irritating. Depressingly common thinking. Kind of funny to see the link between that and Law of Excluded Middle, another classical simplification which is wrong with modern nuanced models.
[21:00:04] <dstolfa> i went to his talk completely blind, i had no clue about him other than the actor model and for 2 hours i thought i was crazy because i thought the talk was pure garbage and the room was full. i was however, reassured afterwards that plenty of people thought the talk was pure garbage
[21:00:14] <Zipheir> Heh, what would a constructivist say? :-)
[21:05:03] <Zipheir> Maybe actors are like philosophers' zombies: "essentially different" from λs, but observationally completely identical.
[21:10:43] <Corbin> Zipheir: I have a from-scratch proof that basic Hewitt actors give a Cartesian closed category, and the internal language of such categories is always a lambda calculus. So they're also structurally identical.
[21:11:38] <Zipheir> Corbin: Very nice.
[21:12:12] <Corbin> I *did* define something useful. Take a lambda and run it through a state monad so that it's got some internal mutable state; this will be like an actor for us. Then the "spectrum of an actor" is the collection of possible output values for the actor, as it ranges across all of its possible inputs and states. When discrete, this simplifies to classic results about Mealy/Moore machines.
[21:20:01] <dstolfa> Corbin: but you don't understand, actor model is very special in its own way, it achieves an abstraction that is impossible to compete with. i have proof of this but for privacy reasons i can't publish it /s
