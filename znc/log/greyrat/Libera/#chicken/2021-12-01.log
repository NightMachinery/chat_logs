[10:53:48] <mario-goulart> Looks like that's the ultimate solution for the CHICKEN problems on Windows: https://github.com/mrthefakeperson/Excel-Virtual-Machine (from https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29399862 )
[10:57:50] <wasamasa> wat
[11:00:26] <s-liao> Why is it Excel-Virtual-Machine?
[11:08:45] <wasamasa> because someone implemented a virtual machine using nothing but excel formulae
[11:10:07] <wasamasa> and a compiler using F# from a C subset to the machine code of that virtual machine
[11:10:21] <wasamasa> that virtual machine runs that machine code if you just hit F9 often enough
[11:12:42] <s-liao> But why is the ultimate solution for the CHICKEN problems on Windows?
[11:13:10] <mario-goulart> That was a joke.
[11:13:21] <s-liao> It need run machine code for chicken in windows?
[11:15:29] <s-liao> Okay. I was thinking that if the compiler cc in Windows have the problem with chicken.
[11:15:48] <wasamasa> note that when I speak of "machine code" above I mean the very simple machine code of that virtual machine
[11:15:59] <wasamasa> not native machine code
[11:16:34] <wasamasa> similarly, that virtual machine is not to be confused with virtualization software designed to run native machine code
[11:19:59] *** Parts: amazigh (~amirouche@user/amirouche) (WeeChat 2.8)
[11:22:19] <s-liao> Okay. one is simulation code on the software, one is binary code on hardware.
[11:25:17] <s-liao> One more thing is that the hahn egg the linker is broken on the webpage http://eggs.call-cc.org/5/
[11:27:46] <s-liao> One time, I saw your guys sent one linker, which has one while space in the URL, then it just show the first work in the linker, Then the result does not exist.

[11:33:34] <wasamasa> a linker is something very very different from a link
[11:34:01] <wasamasa> hahn is broken on C5 anyway
[11:34:21] <wasamasa> it could be made to work, but the author doesn't seem to be interested: https://github.com/klutometis/hahn/pull/1
[11:35:12] <wasamasa> oh wait
[11:35:33] <wasamasa> so that has been merged, strange
[11:36:10] <wasamasa> ah, I'm thinking of https://github.com/klutometis/hahn-utils/pull/1
[11:36:21] <sjamaan> Even tagged and added to the release-info
[11:36:31] <wasamasa> hahn without hahn-utils is kind of useless
[11:36:56] <wasamasa> because hahn-utils provides the executable
[11:37:04] <wasamasa> the hahn wiki page is about how to use that executable
[11:37:43] <wasamasa> http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/hahn#the-setupfile
[11:45:29] <s-liao> Okay. Thanks
[11:47:51] <s-liao> wasamasa do think that it is safe to add one more function into loaded js file?

[12:33:18] <wasamasa> what loaded JS file?
[12:34:42] <s-liao> Like require (./myfile.js) in REPL of node.
[12:35:06] <s-liao> Then the file is loaded.
[12:36:45] <s-liao> Then you can come into the module, by module.children[0]
[12:38:28] <wasamasa> what does that have to do with #chicken?
[12:39:00] <s-liao> Then it can be done like module.children[0].exports={exportfunc: func-expression }
[12:39:22] <s-liao> I mean that in chicken, it can be done in this way.
[12:39:53] <s-liao> it can  not be done in this way.
[12:40:41] <wasamasa> I still have no idea what you're asking for
[12:42:44] <s-liao> if it is safety, then chicken need to support it?
[12:43:44] <s-liao> dynamically to add the exported functions in one module.
[12:44:54] <wasamasa> CHICKEN is rather static when it comes to modules, though you can manipulate them in csi
