[01:41:56] <kepstin> thebombzen: no existing way using ffmpeg. could probably build such a tool using ffmpeg libraries, i dunno if anyone already has?
[01:41:58] <kepstin> thebombzen: main complication is that the newly encoded bits have to quite precisely match the settings used for encoding the existing bits, which can be really challenging to do, and sometimes requires encoding in a concatenation-friendly mode.
[01:42:20] *** Quits: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:42:34] <thebombzen> In my specific instance I plan on re-encoding the whole bitstream later. I was just hoping I could skip a transcode to lossless if possible.

[01:42:55] <thebombzen> or skip a transcode to some high-bitrate intermediary
[01:43:21] <JEEB> thebombzen: the problem with half-re-encoding is the whole thing of matching parameter sets
[01:43:28] <JEEB> (for H.264 / HEVC etc)
[01:43:48] <JEEB> so you'd have to have a mapping written down from parsed parameter sets to how you mimic that with a specific encoder
[01:43:58] <JEEB> like H.264 <-> libx264 for example
[01:44:34] <thebombzen> well in my case what I want to do is ideally encode, say, the first GOP to part1.mkv, streamcopy to part2.mkv, and then encode the last GOP to part3.mkv. using -qp:v 0 for part1 and part3
[01:44:35] <JEEB> not impossible but it explains why a generic API client like ffmpeg.c doesn't do it
[01:44:57] <thebombzen> then I can potentially use the concat filter to just decode them all and transcode
[01:44:57] <JEEB> oh, so multiple parameter sets
[01:45:12] <thebombzen> well the final result is going to be transcoded since this is a raw capture with a massive bitrate
[01:45:20] <thebombzen> impractical for deployment
[01:45:36] <thebombzen> I'm hoping to reduce intermediary transcodes-to-lossless
[01:45:43] <thebombzen> or something similar
[01:45:44] <BtbN> you can't concat lossless h264 with lossy. The extradata does not match.
[01:45:55] <thebombzen> not even with the concat filter?
[01:46:01] <BtbN> oh, with the filter sure
[01:46:06] <JEEB> well with multiple parameter sets you can, but it's *messy*
[01:46:24] <JEEB> like, seeking goes right out of the window if the right parameter sets aren't given to the right stuff
[01:46:26] <thebombzen> my goal for the final render would be to decode all of the parts, concat filter them, and then transcode the rawvideo
[01:46:28] <JEEB> or am I misunderstanding something
[01:47:09] <kepstin> i'm kind of unclear what's going on, why aren't you just doing this transcode with cutting in one step?
[01:47:12] <BtbN> But I don't see the advantage here over any other lossless intermediade codec
[01:47:23] <kepstin> no need for an intermediate at all
[01:47:27] <BtbN> Or just doing it all in one step, yeah
[01:47:57] <JEEB> for A->B it is possible to have [parameter sets]->[video packets]->[parameter sets]->[video packets]->[parameter sets]->[video packets] , but that's fragile as all hell with seeking
[01:48:32] <thebombzen> basically I have a massive bitrate screen capture recorded in realtime. like 100 Mbps kind of massive. I'd like to extract specific subparts from the capture, which probably won't lie on GOP boundaries, concatenate the sub-parts, and then render it. Something which I'm aware would be far easier to do with an NLE.
[01:48:34] <BtbN> I don't see where you see seeking issue, when the final step is a full re-encode and mux
[01:49:10] <thebombzen> My current process involves rendering each invidual subparts with identical x264 parameters and then concatenating them without transcoding
[01:49:12] <kepstin> thebombzen: assuming your raw input file is seekable, you can just use multiple inputs with -ss and -t, and concat filter. no intermediates needed.
[01:49:18] <BtbN> thebombzen, just add that massive file as input multiple times, set the desired cuts, and then concat filter it?
[01:49:31] <JEEB> or utilize some frame server?
[01:49:40] <JEEB> if the idea is to just encode [x,y] + [z,a]
[01:49:41] <JEEB> etc
[01:49:53] <thebombzen> well the input file isn't seekable (.ts) but I could very easily streamcopy it to a matroska or mp4 or something seekable
[01:50:03] <thebombzen> I suppose that could work, that's... a really obvious solution lmao.
[01:50:18] <thebombzen> Now that I think about it.
[01:51:10] <thebombzen> thanks
[01:53:04] <thebombzen> can you use -t as an input option to avoid needing trim filters?

[03:05:06] <BtbN> You can make lossless intermediates then, if blender is bad at handling framerates

[03:08:53] <bencc1> thanks
[03:19:54] <bencc1> what about 60 fps to 30 fps?
[03:20:02] <bencc1> possible without re-encoding or same thing?
[03:20:30] <BtbN> You cannot alter the video without re-encoding
[03:20:49] <BtbN> and you obviously throw away half the frames if you do that. I'd call that quality loss
[03:21:34] <bencc1> with huffyuv 1 minute of video takes 2.5GB
[03:21:58] <DeHackEd> there's a hack where some containers support a null frame which is treated as a "duplicate previous frame" without having the decoder process them... but I still see no real benefit to doing this in the first place if you just want to go 30->60 globally
[03:22:29] <BtbN> like, literally everything playing a 30 fps video as 60 fps will just double each frame

[06:30:16] <Themis3000> Hey can anyone point me in a direction of how to do something real quick?
[06:30:27] <\> depends on what that thing is
[06:31:16] <Themis3000> I've got a whole lot of pixel art images that are low resolution that I'm converting into a video that I want to be 1080p. It works okay, but the output video is very blurry, the pixels don't have defined edges
[06:31:36] <Themis3000> Is their a way to change the upscaler to not do that?
[06:31:54] <Themis3000> It's a timelapse of pixel art
[06:32:06] <\> hm... it might be applying some kind of filtering to it (bilinear, maybe?) when you should be using nearest-neighbor instead
[06:32:15] <\> I don't know if there's an option to change that though, let me look
[06:32:44] <Themis3000> Okay thank you so much! I'm not familiar with ffmpeg at all so I wasn't sure where to start to figure something like this out

[06:33:21] <Themis3000> yeah, specifically using -s 1920x1080
[06:33:33] <\> alright after that -s, put "-sws_flags neighbor"

[06:33:58] <Themis3000> Alright I'll give that a shot
[06:36:26] <Themis3000> Hmm that surprisingly didn't fix it, I thought that'd do it. There must be an issue somewhere else
[06:36:32] <Themis3000> BlueSwordM[m]: I'll give that a shot too
[06:38:57] <Themis3000> BlueSwordM[m]: I modified your command a little bit to fit my use case and it worked perfectly!

[14:04:03] <x1845> hi, when i use obs to record games with vaapi  30 fps and 1080p convert to 720p i got smooth video. But when i use ffmepg and use h264_vaapi with 30fps and convert 1080p to 720p i got choppy video. But if i set 60 fps and record games with ffmpeg with other same settings i got smooth video. Why record with 30 fps is broken on ffmpeg?

[20:17:15] <kepstin> personally, i wouldn't post a video or screenshots unless you have a specific question about something going wrong with a particular video which can't be reproduced with synthetic content.
[20:17:45] <kepstin> as far as it goes, no particular policies that I've heard of? Any concerns about copyright or fair use are all on you.
[20:21:05] <kepstin> policies of the irc network itself (libera.chat) also apply of course.
