[02:19:59] <murthy> swap partition
[02:21:04] <morlog> man
[02:21:04] <murthy> did "sudo swapoff -a", then commented out the entry in fstab, booted into live image and deleted the swap partition and grew the root
[02:21:15] <morlog> cool
[02:21:26] <morlog> that's the easiest way
[02:21:31] <murthy> ya
[02:21:40] <morlog> I like how mint uses a swapfile
[02:21:55] <murthy> like windows
[02:22:01] <artao> I am very glad I bought this quality ergonomic keyboard.
[02:22:02] <artao> I just suddenly realized that I don't have aches and pains in my pink fingers and outer wrist anymore. :D
[02:22:19] <morlog> just edit fstab and delete the file after turning the swap off
[02:22:30] <murthy> I think I use a swapfile in my aws server
[02:22:47] <murthy> artao: nice
[02:23:02] <morlog> with windows it's the printer spool file that screws everything up
[02:25:05] <murthy> I never liked anything that is printer
[02:25:22] <murthy> one of the fscked up part of a OS and in general hardware

[02:33:26] <artao> i "need" a printer
[02:33:40] <artao> i've talked about buying one many times but haven't
[02:33:49] <artao> it'd be very useful tho
[02:34:35] *** inertia[away] is now known as inertia
[02:34:45] *** inertia is now known as inertia[away]
[02:34:54] <artao> B&W or color?
[02:35:02] <artao> most of what i'd use it for b&w would be fine
[02:35:06] <artao> laser or ink?
[02:35:29] <artao> i might not use it enuf and the ink cartridge would "go bad" i.e. the heads would dry up
[02:35:37] <artao> laser is more $$$
[02:35:57] <artao> and get a scanner/printer or just printer?
[02:37:12] <artao> with a scanner/printer i could put an ad in the paper to do  real photo retouching and resotration and provide digital copies for the customer to print
[02:37:13] <louipc> b/w laser printer is good
[02:37:19] <artao> ja
[02:37:25] <louipc> or b/w laser all-in-one
[02:37:28] <artao> ja
[02:37:33] <louipc> its really not that expensive
[02:37:42] <louipc> and the cartrige last forever
[02:37:50] <artao> well ... i'm in deep poverty. under $9k/yr
[02:38:21] <artao> this place i used to work has a laser printer of a MUCH different sort
[02:38:27] <louipc> yea i guess u need a business plan to justify it maybe
[02:38:34] <artao> it uses RGB lasers to directly develop photographic paper
[02:38:42] <artao> so the output is literally a photograph
[02:38:55] <artao> with all the archival properties that come with that
[02:39:07] <louipc> yea need special paper
[02:39:38] <artao> as such, you stay within the additive light paradigm the whole way. no conversion to CMYK, which always causes loss of color and dynamic range
[02:39:49] <artao> no. just regular old photograph paper will work
[02:40:07] <artao> i mean .. yeah, sure. if you have one you buy the paper in rolls, made for the machine
[02:40:20] <artao> but if you wanted to you could just send thru regular photographic paper
[02:40:35] <artao> and it's quite reasonably priced as well
[02:40:38] <louipc> old photo what?
[02:40:43] <artao> restoration
[02:40:48] <louipc> its called 'zink' paper
[02:40:53] <louipc> zink printer
[02:41:10] <artao> scan them in, fix em up, give the customer the digital to print, prehaps recommending Burne
[02:41:10] <louipc> that i was thiking of
[02:41:14] <artao> (where i used to work)
[02:41:25] <artao> .... doing photo scanning and restoration ...
[02:41:29] <artao> i'm pretty good at it
[02:41:54] <louipc> ok
[02:42:37] <louipc> never heard of printer that uses regular photo paper
[02:43:05] <artao> they're fucking awesome
[02:43:15] <artao> like i said. the output is LITERALLY a photograph
[02:43:22] <artao> not a print. no ink is involved
[02:43:27] <artao> nor dye
[02:43:32] <artao> nor wax
[02:43:36] <louipc> 'light jet?'
[02:43:45] <artao> yeah! i think
[02:43:50] <artao> i think that's a brand
[02:43:52] <artao> or model
[02:44:03] <louipc> looks expensive
[02:44:10] <artao> quite
[02:44:37] <artao> the price is reasonable cuz you puzzle together a whole bunch of images when you do a print run
[02:44:38] <louipc> no prob
[02:44:44] <louipc> just get more money
[02:44:46] <artao> the software actually pretty much does that for you
[02:44:58] <artao> last i checked a good one was like $25k usd
[02:45:21] <louipc> i dont print enough for myself to be worth it tho
[02:45:26] <louipc> must be a bizniz
[02:45:32] <artao> and then there's giclee printing
[02:45:39] <louipc> wuzat
[02:45:51] <artao> ink jet printing, but on archival quality paper and with archival quality inks
[02:45:59] <artao> and usually more than 4 colors. often 7
[02:46:04] <louipc> is this how walmart prints digital photos 
[02:46:11] <artao> HIGH quality art prints
[02:46:17] <artao> LOLno
[02:46:35] <artao> those are CMYK on glossy paper
[02:46:46] <artao> inkjet
[02:46:57] <louipc> oh dang. u can beat walmart then

[02:48:04] <artao> no. it's not stored as ink. it's stored as powder
[02:48:11] <louipc> same diff
[02:48:14] <artao> no
[02:48:23] <louipc> close enough
[02:48:29] <artao> ink can dry up and the cartridge is done
[02:48:32] <artao> powder can't
[02:48:39] <louipc> sure
[02:48:48] <artao> the print heads could get clogged, but that's easy to clean
[02:49:06] <louipc> its way faster
[02:49:15] <artao> also not archival quality
[02:49:26] <artao> tho you CAN alleviate that a bit by using archival quality paper
[02:49:40] <artao> ... actually, idunno if you can get archival quality toner
[02:49:40] <louipc> laser is not quality?
[02:50:01] <louipc> it doesnt bleed when moistened like inkjet
[02:50:05] <artao> the laser in a laser printer just ... "solidifies and glues" the toner powder to the paper
[02:50:07] <louipc> so i think its better quality

[02:50:45] <louipc> then the paper comes out all wet
[02:50:48] <louipc> and wavy
[02:50:49] <artao> so yeah. ink bleeds into the paper, so that can happen with inkjets, depending what paper you use
[02:51:00] <artao> it generally isn't a problem with glossy photo paper
[02:51:16] <artao> yeah. wet and wavy. that too
[02:51:22] <artao> annoying AF to try to keep it flat
[02:51:34] <artao> gotta quickly stretch it on a board using thumb tacks

[02:52:04] <louipc> i got laser as soon as possible
[02:52:15] <artao> but printer paper is usually only like 20 lb paper, so when it's all wet like that you gotta be careful to not rip it

[03:48:01] <murthy> I think I have seen that game
[03:48:02] <artao> but sandbox open world MMP
[03:48:05] <artao> not really RPG
[03:49:03] <artao> with the newest DLC (which i don't yet have) you can land on planets with an atmosphere up to 0.1 atmospheres, and get out and actually WALK
[03:49:27] <murthy> those DLC thing are big scams
[03:49:34] <artao> previously (with the Horizons expansion) you could only land on bodies with no atmosphere, and only drive in your rover
[03:49:44] <artao> it depends
[03:49:47] <murthy> buy the game for $1 and then buy the DLC for a million dollar each
[03:49:50] <artao> some are reasonably priced
[03:49:55] <murthy> idk
[03:49:59] <artao> some are but only if you wait for a sale
[03:50:12] <artao> but a lot of games? i agree
[03:50:25] <murthy> Those days I bought the whole game on a disk
[03:50:26] <artao> there's this one naval sim. i forget what it's called
[03:50:32] <murthy> get updates free
[03:50:39] <artao> 70 bucks for the base game, then like 40 to 60 per DLC
[03:50:40] <artao> wtaf
[03:50:47] <murthy> nautical something?
[03:51:03] <artao> and okay. DCS: World is free to play, with two free planes. only one of which is worth flying
[03:51:09] <artao> but then every plane is 40 to 60 bucks
[03:51:17] <artao> sure. they're SUPER detailed
[03:51:29] <artao> you can use every switch, button, and slider in the cockpit pretty much
[03:51:56] <artao> after playing enuf, you could sit in the real thing, start it up, take off, navigate, and land

[04:00:21] <Panther> I did fly a little 2 engine airplane for about 2 minutes. Or, really.. I held the co-pilot wheel and just kept is steady while the pilot, my neighbor, watched.
[04:00:25] <artao> just not a commercial license
[04:00:44] <artao> totally separate licenses
[04:01:16] <artao> also certifications. multi-engine jet is much different than single prop plane
[04:01:17] <artao> ;)
[04:01:46] <artao> honestly, the hardest part about flying is properly using the radios for navigation
[04:02:02] <artao> along with calculating your drift and "crabbing" to account for it
[04:02:30] <artao> strong wind from the north? you have to plot your course south of your destination
[04:02:32] <artao> etc
[04:02:38] <artao> THAT's the hard part
[04:02:43] <artao> FUCK
[04:03:00] <artao> airliners generally fly on autopilot except when landing and taking off
[04:03:26] <artao> landing IS tricky, but once you get the hang of it it becomes pretty routi8ne
[04:03:41] <artao> ... all of this disregards bad weather

[23:05:01] <Inline> got my 2 jabs but it's not a guarantee you know
[23:05:10] <nativetexan> yes sir
[23:05:16] <Inline> got my last jab on 4th november
[23:05:38] <Inline> seems like we'll need more jabs each 6 months or so
[23:05:53] <nativetexan> mmm yeah i've been reading about that
[23:06:06] <Inline> and also wear masks etc etc.
[23:06:17] <Inline> we are not gonna get rid of that virus
[23:06:42] <nativetexan> time will tell
[23:06:53] <Inline> hmmm yah we'll see

[23:08:06] <nativetexan> cheers
[23:09:08] <Inline> even a recovery does not help for reinfection at least not 100%
[23:10:04] <Inline> if you get infected and you recover then you get immunity in your body, but the body has at least 2 weeks to start produce antibodies
[23:10:24] <nativetexan> seems like the natural immunity is often overlooked as well
[23:10:33] <Inline> so you are vulnerable either way and nothing stops the spread anyway
[23:10:51] <Inline> no idea about natural immunity
[23:11:21] <Inline> not sure you can identify naturally immune persons so easily in society
[23:11:45] <nativetexan> yeah, true

[23:13:02] <nativetexan> i've been in hundreds of other people's homes and did not get covid, or had it and didn't notice
[23:13:06] * nativetexan knocks on wood
[23:13:17] <Inline> hmmm
[23:13:21] <Inline> that sounds good
[23:13:22] <Inline> lol
[23:14:54] <Inline> well say you had theoretically a counterpart to the virus which binds to it in it's unfolded form (chelating it) and so bringing it out of solution (precipitating)
[23:15:12] <Inline> and say you could inject people with it, but that would be dangerous right ?
[23:15:30] <nativetexan> injecting otther people's sweat?
[23:15:47] <nativetexan> saline solution
[23:15:48] <Inline> no injecting with a virus chelating agent
[23:16:42] <Inline> that would tho clog the cells, especially when the cell got many viruses
[23:17:04] *** Quits: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:17:09] <Inline> so you'd need in addition to chelation also a way of getting rid of that cruft
[23:17:18] <nativetexan> i'm still trying to figure out what a chelating agent is...hehe
[23:17:20] <Inline> a modular mechanism
[23:18:59] <Inline> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelation
[23:18:59] <Janet`> ^ Chelation is a type of bonding of ions and molecules to metal ions. It involves the formation or presence of two or more separate coordinate bonds between a polydentate ligand and a single central metal atom.
[23:18:59] <nativetexan> yeah, sounds good. just add the covid module to the mechanism and let 'er rip
[23:19:38] <Inline> welp, chelation is actually ligand binding, metallic ion attraction
[23:20:04] <Inline> since virus has no metal in it, you can't do that
[23:20:22] *** inertia[away] is now known as inertia
[23:20:33] <Inline> but you can still use that term when you have something resembling it
[23:20:53] <Inline> maybe some electron dense regions ?
[23:20:54] *** inertia is now known as inertia[away]
[23:21:00] <nativetexan> maybe you could have the valance electron with a negative or positive charge?
[23:21:08] *** Joins: lakitu (~lakitu@192-198-3-9.dhcp.radiolinkinternet.com)
[23:21:26] <Inline> ya, either electron dense or electron sparse regions
[23:22:06] <Inline> one can design a molecule around that domain then
[23:22:14] <Inline> so you get then the binding part
[23:22:25] <Inline> but that won't bring it out of solution either
[23:22:46] <Inline> you'll need to make your designed molecule heavy enough on some boundary condition
[23:23:07] <Inline> short on the treshold already so to say
[23:23:18] <Inline> and when it binds it already gets too heavy and falls out of solution
[23:23:49] <Inline> forcing it to tumble down the gravity gradient onto the bottom cell walls
[23:24:02] <Inline> and now the 3rd part
[23:24:34] <Inline> you'd have to design the molecule so in order to get it recognized by the cell wall components (say a bunch of protein machinery)
[23:24:52] <Inline> to get the virus shutled back out of the cell

[23:25:44] <Janet`> ^ TOOL - Schism - YouTube
[23:25:47] <Inline> or to direct it to the vesicle machinery which shuttles it out via secretion out of body
[23:26:58] <nativetexan> ah, so the body recognizes it as waste 
[23:27:04] <Inline> so the end effect would be some kinda secretory (sweating ? pissing ?) pathway
[23:27:12] <Inline> right
[23:27:32] <Inline> still not a 100% chance
[23:27:55] <Inline> there might be more viruses already then your molecules present
[23:28:47] <Inline> in that case some will just make it to the nucleus and produce mRNA in the cell
[23:28:48] *** Joins: Colt (~Colt@user/colt)
[23:29:29] <Inline> or you could tailor the mRNA apparatus to recognize it and and not let it reproduce
[23:29:43] <Inline> hmmmm
[23:29:58] <Inline> not sure there are many possible ways i think
[23:31:03] <Inline> in the mRNA case i'm not sure the hardcoding way would be viable, cause it mutates so much ?
[23:32:21] <nativetexan> yeah, no idea
