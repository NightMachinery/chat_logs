[00:00:57] <imode> I mean.
[00:01:11] <imode> I get the point. but it's a poor example.
[00:02:13] <imode> because you could feasibly _do_ that with existing tools.
[00:02:17] <imode> with little edge cases.
[00:02:30] <imode> what they're describing is scope creep. or "productionizing" something.
[00:02:51] <imode> and like, yeah, those are valid wants.. but I'm the only user for this particular tool.
[00:03:00] <Brekkjern> Are you?
[00:03:14] <imode> yeah. I don't have a duty to you if I release the source.
[00:03:16] <Brekkjern> Like, I wouldn't go to college to learn how to make toy programs for myself.
[00:03:43] <Brekkjern> This example is set in a classroom with students that are supposed to learn how to create products of some sort
[00:03:46] <imode> I assume you want to make programs that you use.
[00:03:54] <imode> well, you're in a shit-tier school then.
[00:04:02] <Brekkjern> Why?
[00:04:03] <imode> that'll produce shit-tier programmers. plain and simple.
[00:04:31] <imode> because in the time that you invent and engineer "products", the rest of us will have gotten there first with dirty hacks that can be improved over time.
[00:04:55] <Brekkjern> And you blew up a few space shuttles on the way.
[00:05:05] <imode> yeah. which is industry standard.
[00:05:11] <imode> because space shuttles are not products.
[00:05:39] <imode> space shuttles are high intensity engineering endeavors. I'm not selling a space shuttle to a business to gain a market share.
[00:05:48] <imode> I'm not convincing several hundred users to use a space shuttle.
[00:05:51] <Brekkjern> The point of the exercise isn't that it's not possible to create that proof of concept tool. It's that it's not a useful product before you scope it properly and examine what additional complexities that should be added and which are scope creep.
[00:06:51] <imode> the blog post demonstrates that someone took a reasonable tool that I could write in about 30 minutes in AutoHotkey for *doze (which their platform of choice is, by the screenshots) and inflated it to something you'd sell on a big box store shelf.
[00:07:06] <imode> in what world is that indicative of anything other than "I like to inflate simple things to make a point".
[00:07:11] <imode> you could've literally chosen twitter.
[00:07:20] <imode> because everybody tries to clone twitter.
[00:07:22] <imode> and that's a hairy beast.
[00:07:28] <edk> i do think there's an interesting thing to cover here which is that it's only really when companies are established that they start doing that
[00:07:40] <imode> do what, clone twitter? :P
[00:07:47] <Brekkjern> It's because they have a reputation that could be tarnished
[00:07:50] <edk> no, scope creeping products until they take months to complete
[00:07:53] <imode> yeah.
[00:07:57] <edk> lots of startups' core codebase was written in... well probably not two hours, but less than a month
[00:08:09] <edk> and yeah, i'm not saying the established companies are doing it wrong
[00:08:18] <imode> lots of production code at BigCo is written in the same fashion.
[00:08:27] <imode> lots of it.
[00:08:29] <imode> in fact I'd say 3/4ths.
[00:08:44] <imode> does it suck? yes. do we have time to do it another way? no.
[00:08:54] <imode> there are decisions that are made for you given a set of constraints.
[00:09:00] <edk> at my medium-sized employer it's pretty much unknown for a product to get to market in less than 6 months
[00:09:03] <imode> learning how to recognize that makes you an engineer.
[00:09:14] <gwozniak> edk: we take a long time here too
[00:10:07] <imode> y'all can afford to, and we can probably afford to too. there is a management aspect to this.
[00:10:42] <gwozniak> Yes, constraints outside of your control affect products an awful lot
[00:11:22] <Brekkjern> Absolutely
[00:11:58] <edk> i do think the clipboard person is anticipating a bunch of customer requirements that wouldn't be at all necessary to make the first sale
[00:12:05] <gwozniak> But what I take away from that post is that a lot of the time the requirements can be so loose that you can read a lot into what someone wants, so watch out
[00:12:08] <edk> to put it into product terms
[00:12:59] <gwozniak> There is definitely scope creep there, but there are also things you can reasonably anticipate, so maybe think ahead a bit without actually implementing it
[00:13:20] <edk> yeah, for sure
[00:13:52] <Brekkjern> I think at least half of those requirements were reasonable requirements. You could probably drop a few of them, but if an end user is supposed to be using this product, then you need some of the points off of that list.
[00:13:54] <gwozniak> We take a long time because we can't shove out something that fails in even edge cases
[00:14:34] <gwozniak> I doubt the 2 hour version would be all that nice to use, even if I'm the only one using it
[00:14:41] <Brekkjern> Same
[00:14:53] <imode> it would be reasonable if my requirements used it.
[00:14:59] <edk> yeah, but it might still be useful
[00:15:07] <imode> rough framing is a thing.
[00:15:18] <imode> I can't live in the house but I can at least know its shape.
[00:15:28] <imode> helps when you have experience.
[00:16:23] <gwozniak> edk: yeah, I think it could still be useful
[00:17:28] <gwozniak> imode: learning to know when to stop worrying about the plan and moving to actually implementing something is an experience thing, for sure
[00:18:12] <gwozniak> it's hard to know when that is, because it's not strictly a technical problem
[00:18:27] <imode> that's right, it's a mental and management problem.
[00:18:51] <gwozniak> Similarly, knowing when to stop implementing, step back and assess is also good to know
[00:19:23] <imode> that's the balance. between the things that're required of you, and the things you're in control of.
[00:19:47] <gwozniak> Having some foresight to know "this line of action is going to fuck us over" takes some practice
[00:21:10] <gwozniak> We're embarking on a big project on our team and we are going in with an idea, and have no idea if it's going to work.  Which sucks, but we are having a helluva time reducing the uncertainty
[00:21:57] <gwozniak> It is a good mix of analysis and implementation at this point, with the assumption that a lot of what we write we won't be able to use
[00:22:35] <imode> the time budget must allow for such things is all I'll really say. defeatist attitudes towards that kind of thinking fill one part of the thread, positivisim towards another.
[00:23:02] <gwozniak> Yeah. Time budget is rarely under your control
[00:23:15] <gwozniak> "Your" being the engineering team
[00:23:34] <imode> yeeeeah..
[00:23:56] <imode> there was a nice article on HN that's actually of this nature that I feel demonstrates the problem a little more intuitively.
[00:24:21] <imode> https://realfiction.net/2016/02/28/on-the-fractal-nature-of-effort-estimates
[00:30:17] <gwozniak> A couple years ago I was moved to a project to update a base GCC version on a compiler.  It was about 10 years out of date at the time.  I estimated we'd have something that worked in about 6 months
[00:30:55] <gwozniak> I ended up being just about right.  We had a limping version up and running at the end of 6 months
[00:30:56] <imode> I would say a year or two lol.
[00:31:10] <riv> i would have said 10 year
[00:31:28] <gwozniak> But then getting it to pass all the tests took about another 8+ months
[00:31:46] <imode> yeah that sounds about right. effort is proportional when you have established efforts.
[00:31:50] <gwozniak> I should point out that my original estimate was just for something that kinda, sorta worked
[00:32:19] <gwozniak> I made no promises about passing tests because, frankly, there were just too many unknowns
[00:33:09] <gwozniak> That 6 month estimate was my "2 hour project" statement, but I knew it wasn't going to be anywhere near "done"
[00:33:29] <imode> would the faces in the room smile or frown if you pitched a 2 year incubation time.
[00:33:51] <gwozniak> But -- and this is the crucial part -- I knew the 6 month thing would make the higher-ups happy
[00:34:24] <gwozniak> They could report that they had something that approached usable, which is all they really want
[00:34:53] <gwozniak> "Working the kinks out" is something they are willing to live with for some time
[00:35:30] <imode> yyyup.
[00:35:40] <imode> progress matters.
[00:36:22] <gwozniak> And it's still not done, but by this time there is much different political climate around the project in that the customer has put it off to the side for $reasons not related to us

[00:36:47] <Brekkjern> So it is finally out
[00:37:45] <imode> ..permanently.
[00:40:20] <imode> yes, the quality of your search results suck, because your search sucks.
[00:41:05] <imode> why are you looking for a "gaming focused OS".
[00:41:17] <imode> you just said you said you wanted a generalist OS.
[00:41:35] <Brekkjern> Cause he mostly plays games on his home computer?
[00:42:08] <imode> you don't search for "best windows version for gaming".
[00:42:22] <Brekkjern> No, because there really isn't much choice.
[00:42:25] <imode> he went down a rabbit hole without needing to go down the rabbit hole.
[00:42:37] <imode> oh there's plenty of choice, just none of it supported by LTS releases anymore. ;)
[00:42:42] <imode> ...and also the latest one.
[00:42:50] <imode> which everybody hates.
[00:47:19] <gwozniak> What is the latest one?
[00:47:23] <imode> windows 11.
[00:47:50] <gwozniak> Oh, sorry, I thought you meant a Linux thing.
[00:48:01] <gwozniak> Yeah, I'm not hearing a lot of good buzz about Win11
[00:50:31] <indigo> I actually really like Windows 11
[00:50:35] <indigo> Maybe I'm the only one?
[00:50:54] <Brekkjern> I haven't tried it yet. I don't immediately see anything that makes me want it though.
[00:50:55] <Xe> pam is horrifying
[00:51:29] <indigo> I like the tiling groups, the nicer settings panel and native WSLg support
[00:51:39] <Brekkjern> indigo: Like, window tiling?
[00:51:47] <Brekkjern> That would be nice to have natively.
[00:51:57] <indigo> Yeah; if you hover over the maximize button you can tile windows in certain patterns
[00:52:10] <Brekkjern> Hmm. I'm not sure that is really what I want?
[00:52:11] <indigo> I'm not sure if there are keyboard combinations
[00:52:59] <indigo> With Win10 you can do the Win+left and Win+right to get 50/50 vertical tiling
[00:53:02] <imode> if they bring i3-like tiling that'd be neat. I still wouldn't use it, but it'd be neat.
[00:55:36] <Brekkjern> I just want to be able to split my left monitor in two so I have one app above and another below.
[00:55:57] <Brekkjern> I have a solution for it now, but it's not perfect.
[00:57:14] <gwozniak> If they fix it so that it remembers window positions I'd appreciate it
[00:57:19] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[00:58:24] <gwozniak> I use the Powertoys thing to split the screen
[00:58:27] <Brekkjern> Same
[00:58:34] <Brekkjern> It works, but it's a bit janky
[00:58:38] <gwozniak> yeah
[01:12:36] <gerikson> most of the "brutalist" websites mentioined in htis comment are anyhthing but https://lobste.rs/s/cxr4ml/reality_where_css_javascript_don_t_exist#c_qko2ow
[01:12:36] <buttsbot> A Reality Where CSS & JavaScript Don’t Exist…? | Lobsters
[01:18:58] <riv> thats minimalist not brutialist
[01:21:03] <prussian> Xe: I, too, cannot stand pam
[01:23:38] <prussian> Brekkjern: this video horrifies me. Most these distros I never have heard of.
[01:24:12] <Brekkjern> Only some of them I hadn't heard of
[01:24:25] <Brekkjern> But it kinda illustrates how fucking impossible it is to get started with Linux :S
[01:24:39] <Brekkjern> Dude managed to brick his install by trying to get Steam running
[01:24:43] <Brekkjern> That is impressive
[01:24:57] <prussian> Sounds about right.
[01:25:17] <Brekkjern> Honestly though, I don't think it's his fault.
[01:25:32] <prussian> I'm watching it, don't spoil it for me :(
[01:25:39] <Brekkjern> Enjoy :P
[01:25:54] <imode> I had to stop watching, because I don't enjoy CBT.
[01:26:11] <Brekkjern> You use Linux as a daily driver?
[01:26:14] <prussian> Last time I gamed on Linux it was 2015 and I was using a Windows VM
[01:26:16] <prussian> Yes
[01:26:31] <prussian> I only use Linux.
[01:26:42] <imode> you'd be surprised how nice linux gaming is these days with the advent of valve's efforts.
[01:26:46] <imode> and other efforts.
[01:26:50] <imode> but valve owns steam, so.
[01:26:58] <Brekkjern> You just have to sacrifice your GUI to get Steam installed :P
[01:27:19] <imode> how.
[01:27:30] <imode> like actually how.
[01:27:47] <Brekkjern> I dunno, but "sudo apt install steam" did it for Linus.
[01:28:01] <prussian> I'm trying to find out for you imode
[01:28:03] <imode> which distro did he end up going with?
[01:28:08] <prussian> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0506yDSgU7M
[01:28:09] <buttsbot> Linux HATES Me – Daily Driver CHALLENGE Pt.1 - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0506yDSgU7M
[01:28:11] <imode> yeh.
[01:28:13] <prussian> If you wanna watch
[01:28:20] <imode> I have the link, I refuse to watch... mainly because I'm in standup.
[01:28:21] <prussian> They basically both went Ubuntu respins?
[01:28:29] <Brekkjern> Nah
[01:28:30] <imode> oh joy, ubuntu has never been unstable. /s
[01:28:38] <prussian> Pop_OS! And Mint
[01:28:43] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[01:28:45] <imode> mint is literally the worst.
[01:28:54] <imode> it wiped my bootloader in an upgrade.
[01:28:59] <imode> I don't even know how you fuck that up.
[01:29:00] <Brekkjern> Mint has a decent PR department
[01:29:08] <prussian> Honestly, I just can't stand Ubuntu
[01:29:09] <Brekkjern> Shame it can't deliver on their promises
[01:29:14] <riv> I would recommend a beginner use debian
[01:29:29] <Brekkjern> You should reach out to Linus and tell him he did it wrong
[01:29:34] <imode> whichever arch derivative has an installer, go with that.
[01:29:43] <Brekkjern> I'm sure he'd appreciate all the messages he's getting from the community :P
[01:29:49] <prussian> Fedora is the closest "just works" distro I seen and then people get mad about the hardcore freedoms policy
[01:29:55] <imode> "did it wrong" is an understatement but also not the right message to send.
[01:30:08] <imode> we can't internalize everyone's mistakes but there's several of them that we can internalize.
[01:30:11] <prussian> Rip he broke it...
[01:30:12] <dasm> what's the purpose of "ditching windows"? let users use whatever they want. but, clicks matter
[01:30:14] <prussian> I'm confused
[01:30:28] <dasm> if he was looking for some "gaming linux" maybe he should pair up with steam and their arch?
[01:30:31] <Brekkjern> There's really no point in debating the video if people haven't watched it fully :P
[01:30:34] <dasm> nah. bs
[01:30:48] <imode> dasm: this is mostly if not entirely clickbait that feeds into the narrative that "linux hard".
[01:30:56] <imode> I question whether his viewer base can actually build a PC.
[01:31:07] <dasm> Brekkjern: i'm 1.5m in and i'm like... what's the reason behind that?
[01:31:18] <dasm> i should say 1:30 min in
[01:31:24] <Brekkjern> dasm: Reason behind what?
[01:31:38] <dasm> behind that video.
[01:31:52] <dasm> i use linux as a work pc. windows as a game pc, androids, anything else.
[01:31:57] <prussian> So it looks like the steam package on pop os uninstalls the de
[01:32:08] <prussian> And he accepted the consequence manual
[01:32:12] <prussian> Linus did
[01:32:13] <prussian> Rip
[01:32:15] <gerikson> https://twitter.com/JackShawhan/status/1457951413368016899?s=20
[01:32:15] <Brekkjern> They want to present a free and open alternative to Windows for gaming, and show how that works out for them.
[01:32:15] <buttsbot> Twitter - JackShawhan - Help I’ve been giggling about this for an hour. https://t.co/GnmE4gtBiB
[01:32:32] <dasm> Brekkjern: that's not what the title says ;)
[01:32:43] <Brekkjern> That's what he says in the first few minutes
[01:32:45] <imode> yeah that's not at all what this presents, this was carefully written to enforce a narrative lmao.
[01:33:01] <prussian> Honestly... they should have just used ubuntu
[01:33:03] <imode> they have sponsors from microsoft, I don't think they're in a position to represent this in an honest fashion.
[01:33:20] <prussian> Linus literally uninstalled his Desktop Environment
[01:33:23] <prussian> LmO
[01:33:41] <prussian> And that's probably because pop_os! Is just grody
[01:33:41] <imode> I hope the Steam Deck eventually ushers in a new era of Valve cooperating with hardware partners.
[01:33:49] <dasm> imode++
[01:33:57] <imode> because that's effectively what we want.
[01:34:10] <dasm> tbh, i recently started one game on linux and i was surprised when it Just Worked (TM)
[01:34:14] <prussian> Now he is stuck on virtual console
[01:34:16] <dasm> even tho it was windows-only
[01:34:16] <prussian> Rip
[01:34:21] <dasm> because it automatically installed proton
[01:34:26] <imode> my wife routinely plays windows only games. she runs arch (btw).
[01:34:32] <prussian> Nice
[01:34:52] <imode> she also has no idea how to use a computer.
[01:34:54] <prussian> This video is pretty meh.
[01:35:09] <prussian> Life sucks.
[01:35:15] <imode> damn.
[01:35:18] <prussian> imode: ya but she has you.
[01:35:19] <prussian> So
[01:35:22] <imode> yeah.
[01:35:24] <prussian> It doesn't count
[01:35:32] <imode> I have a pager of notes on what to do when stuff goes wrong.
[01:35:39] <imode> so if I'm dead she can keep using stuff
[01:35:43] <imode> even covers install instructions.
[01:35:53] <prussian> I just don't care about gaming. I mean, last game I played was either in browser or foss
[01:35:57] <Brekkjern> The moment shit breaks and she can't get it working again, she's gonna buy a mac.
[01:35:58] <prussian> Nice...
[01:36:11] <imode> she hates macs even worse than windows.
[01:36:23] <imode> love her so damn much.
[01:36:45] <gwozniak> heh
[01:36:49] <imode> but my notes do help. she's got her audio working past a couple of upgrades.
[01:36:58] <imode> she knows how to click a button to do a package manager upgrade.
[01:36:58] <prussian> Nice....
[01:37:00] <prussian> Lucky
[01:37:03] <Brekkjern> I bet she'll hate a Mac less than outdated instructions when shit hits the fan a few years down the line and she doesn't quite understand how things are put together
[01:37:13] <imode> I mean, she understands how things are put together.
[01:37:24] <prussian> She can just ask me duh...
[01:37:25] <imode> a single sentence is enough to explain to most people how a thing works in terms of other things.
[01:37:46] <dasm> i used mac for close to 4y. i used some windows for ~1y. last year i'm back on linux. all of them are bad.
[01:37:53] <prussian> This
[01:38:04] <prussian> I don't even think linux is good. It's just the least bad.
[01:38:11] <imode> it is just the least bad.
[01:38:14] <prussian> I will accept the flame
[01:38:28] <Brekkjern> prussian: I agree entirely, just swap out linux with Windows.
[01:38:29] <prussian> I've been like full linux since like 2014
[01:38:51] <imode> there's no virtue in going through some of these pains that distros put you through.
[01:38:59] <prussian> True
[01:39:01] <imode> but the fact that we have them means we're in a better situation.
[01:39:09] <Brekkjern> It all blows, but at least I can reliably play games and open an SSH connection to a Linux server that does the heavy lifting.
[01:39:26] <imode> I've yet to find a windows game I can't play.
[01:39:36] <prussian> Honestly, I still thing anaconda is the best friendly installer I ever saw. It exposes basically everything you'd probably need to set up
[01:39:42] <prussian> Think*
[01:39:42] <Brekkjern> Does anything using Easy Anti-Cheat work on Linux?
[01:39:43] <imode> which is impressive, and I'm excited what valve is gonna do.
[01:40:28] <imode> Brekkjern: yesssssss I believe so, the situation has been marginally improved over the past two years.
[01:40:48] <imode> epic iirc made a statement about it recently.
[01:41:10] <gwozniak> dasm: I agree they are all bad.  I oscillate between which is least bad every few years
[01:41:11] <prussian> Dare I say, epic.
[01:41:21] <imode> the fact that valve's marketing a product that they have an impetus to support means that this is going to get more of a spotlight.
[01:41:59] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[01:42:08] <prussian> "Support"
[01:42:11] <prussian> We'll see
[01:42:29] <imode> they're internalizing the hardware costs as a platform, not a steam link kind of thing.
[01:42:40] <imode> or partnering with other hardware manufacturers to provide the software and design aesthetics.
[01:42:51] <imode> this is actually something you're expected to use as a computer.
[01:43:34] <prussian> Oh. That portable thingy?

[01:43:59] <imode> yeah. the steam deck.
[01:44:15] <prussian> Ok ya that
[01:44:16] <imode> it runs arch and KDE plasma, I expect that to be the next thing my wife runs.
[01:44:18] <prussian> I forgot the name
[01:44:30] <prussian> btw I use arch
[01:44:34] <prussian> But for everyone?
[01:44:36] <prussian> Whoa.
[01:44:40] <imode> yeah lmao.
[01:44:42] <imode> the meme is real.
[01:45:35] <prussian> Does that mean steam will retarget their sysroot/runtime/whatever to be based on some point release of arch?
[01:45:44] <imode> yep.
[01:45:46] <imode> thank god.
[01:45:48] <prussian> Weird.
[01:45:55] <prussian> Crazy.
[01:45:56] <imode> welllll actually not on a point release.
[01:46:09] <prussian> Ubuntu users are blown the fuck out.
[01:46:14] <imode> I think they're going checkpointed rolling release, with the semantic value of that checkpoint TBD by valve.
[01:46:15] <prussian> Better start pacstrapping...
[01:46:37] <prussian> Well I'm curious to see what they dom
[01:46:39] <prussian> Do.
[01:47:11] <prussian> Speaking of arch. I installed Ubuntu on my work machine with deboostrap because of how God awful the installer was.
[01:47:27] <prussian> It was easier for me to install it like an arch without arch wiki than use the installer...
[01:47:27] <dasm> btw, is anyone believing that steam can do the thing with steam deck? last time they tried with steam machines... and we know where steam machines are...
[01:47:31] <prussian> Let that sink in
[01:47:47] <prussian> I don't know man
[01:48:05] <prussian> dasm: honestly I'm 100 neutral on it.
[01:48:14] <prussian> It could succeed of fail lol
[01:48:20] <imode> steam machines were made by other companies.
[01:48:27] <imode> and it was confusing to get your hands on one.

[01:49:38] <imode> neither am I. necessarily.
[01:49:46] <prussian> But I don't think it really matters also

[03:04:26] <companion_cube> Yeah
[03:05:35] <imode> it is interesting. I like it. the idea of stack effects and typing mixes very well.
[03:07:29] <companion_cube> Yeah it's quite cool
[03:09:06] <imode> it definitely does away with the idea that forth is just an embedded idea.
[03:09:18] <imode> or that concatenative languages can't be subject to the same formalisms.
[03:12:28] <companion_cube> It just seems so hard to program in these :/
[03:12:38] <companion_cube> If only there was a way to have local variables at least
[03:13:10] <imode> you can!
[03:13:32] <imode> in fact I'd even recommend them.
[03:13:33] <companion_cube> How does that work? Can you reserve stack slots or something?
[03:13:49] <imode> nah they're literally just separate locations in RAM in forth.

[03:14:30] <imode> notice the syntax.
[03:16:14] <imode> in FV2, a previous iteration of Feather, I actually derived this syntax from scratch as a macro. the same is pretty common with all forths: seeing as you're in control of the parser, you can do whatever you want.
[03:20:14] <companion_cube> Maybe what I still need is normal syntax on top of a stack vm...
[03:24:41] <dminkovsky> man forth has cartoons in the docs

[06:29:30] <companion_cube> There doesn't seem to be good syntax for handling functions with multiple returns
[06:29:32] <companion_cube> In lisp
[06:29:42] <companion_cube> And that's a strong point of stack machines
[06:30:12] <imode> definitely.
[06:30:39] <imode> what you'll find is that a lot of forth primitives are.. we'll call 'em interesting.
[06:31:03] <imode> dup, drop, swap, rot, the aritied version of those (2dup, etc.)
[06:31:26] <imode> stack juggling sucks. _but_.
[06:31:33] <imode> deque juggling doesn't suck as bad.
[06:32:03] <drakonis> companion_cube: which lisp?
[06:32:05] <drakonis> scheme or clisp?
[06:32:14] <drakonis> one of the srfis should implement multiple return syntax
[06:33:10] <drakonis> scheme has it on srfi-1
[06:33:30] <drakonis> srfi-210 implements that
[06:33:36] <drakonis> https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-210/srfi-210.html
[06:33:36] <buttsbot> SRFI 210: Procedures and Syntax for Multiple Values
[06:34:36] <imode> I don't think he was saying that there isn't syntax.
[06:34:41] <drakonis> i know
[06:34:41] <imode> it's that there's no _good_ syntax.
[06:34:46] <drakonis> yes i've noticed
[06:35:11] <drakonis> there is an srfi with a okayish syntax
[06:36:31] <drakonis> but it largely depends on which lisp you're using
[06:36:32] <imode> imo a deque is far more.. we'll call it natural in terms of an organizational data structure. one of the main reasons is that it's very easy to gain access to arbitrarily nested items and rearrange them in a little more intuitive ways.
[06:36:47] <drakonis> common lisp seems like it hasnt gotten any more standards since the 90s?
[06:37:04] <imode> forth has `pick` and `roll` as primitives which treat the stack as an array.
[06:37:33] <drakonis> https://common-lisp.net/project/cdr/final.html hoo boy
[06:37:34] <buttsbot> Final CDR Documents
[06:37:39] <imode> or, I guess, a portion of the stack as an array. all other primitives can be implemented in them.
[06:37:44] <drakonis> looks like its srfi equivalent never picked up
[06:39:18] <drakonis> but i shouldnt be trying to inject myself into a conversation i'm not good at
[06:39:27] <imode> meh, who's good at anything.
[06:39:29] <drakonis> about a topic i cannot help with
[06:41:48] <imode> `pick` and `roll` can be implemented as, essentially, library functions with a deque. you only need a way to move the end of the deque to the head and vice versa, rolling it to the left or right one item at a time.
[06:42:50] <drakonis> how do you implement a stack based lisp?
[06:43:48] <imode> forth is, in effect, lisp's stack oriented counterpart.
[06:43:58] <drakonis> ih
[06:44:00] <drakonis> oh
[06:44:07] <drakonis> i see
[06:44:11] <imode> it doesn't look like lisp because "no s-expressions".
[06:44:40] <imode> but it has the same characteristics: a nimble but modifiable parser, a method to extend the language, ways to lay data out in memory and modify the core environment..
[06:45:23] <imode> it just looks weird, acts weird and feels weird because you're mixing different kinds of syntax. the parser is literally extendable: any piece of forth code can do.. anything.
[06:45:35] <imode> it is not as elegant, because it is very mechanical and arbitrary, but it is equivalent.
[06:46:03] <drakonis> yes
[06:46:06] <drakonis> i checked the syntax
[06:46:17] <drakonis> its  very ugly

[06:46:52] <drakonis> huh

[06:46:55] <imode> here is its OOP library.
[06:46:57] <drakonis> neat
[06:47:09] <imode> gforth is not object oriented. all of the object orientation is contained in a library.
[06:47:10] <drakonis> gforth is gnu forth
[06:47:14] <drakonis> that's nice.

[06:48:43] <buttsbot> Top (Gforth Manual)
[06:48:57] <drakonis> seems fairly stable at this point
[06:49:02] <imode> it is.
[06:49:34] <imode> https://forth-standard.org/
[06:49:34] <buttsbot> Forth -
[06:50:02] <imode> this'll let you explore some of the 'standard' that people have been continually contributing to.
[06:50:20] <drakonis> ah i see
[06:50:25] <drakonis> its a living standard like scheme
[06:50:25] <imode> forth isn't just a single language, it's more of a.. nebulous design philosophy oriented around token based languages and vaguely stack-machine looking architectures.
[06:50:46] <imode> last I heard chuck moore, OG author, was actually using register machines or something close to them.
[06:51:03] <imode> but treating them like you would a rolling register file, because he usually only needs the top three items on the stack.
[06:51:06] <drakonis> people come up with extension proposals that get accepted
[06:51:18] <drakonis> instead of periodically releasing some major update to the standard
[06:51:36] <imode> yyyyup.
[06:51:45] <drakonis> so its exactly like scheme's
[06:51:49] <imode> effectively.
[06:51:59] <drakonis> works well enough for forth
[06:52:01] <imode> people love to shit on forth. I personally love to shit on forth.
[06:52:09] <drakonis> since there's only 3 different implementations
[06:52:18] <imode> ohoho that's where yer wrong.
[06:52:22] <drakonis> oh?
[06:52:24] <imode> there are probably 1000+ forths in existence.
[06:52:27] <drakonis> jesus christ
[06:52:32] <imode> I've written four.
[06:52:33] <drakonis> guess its the same shit as the lisp family lol
[06:52:40] <imode> well, here's the thing.
[06:52:53] <imode> you can write a forth in a weekend, because you essentially just extend an RPN calculator.
[06:52:54] <drakonis> there's a dozen active implementations for each niche application
[06:52:59] <drakonis> oh, that's fun
[06:53:14] <imode> in fact that's... a common way people get into forth. they implement one before using it!
[06:53:16] <drakonis> let me check something
[06:53:23] <imode> which introduces a slew of uh. less than good things into the community.
[06:53:31] <drakonis> someone implemented a forth in racket
[06:53:31] <imode> because it's more fun to implement a forth than to actually use it for something.
[06:54:06] <drakonis> that's... different.
[06:54:34] <drakonis> but then, its not like i'm not familiar with people that find it more fun to spend time modding video games instead of playing them
[06:55:03] <drakonis> spend a week stacking up mods to then discard it like a broken toy
[06:55:14] <imode> yeah that's accurate.
[06:55:57] <drakonis> wonderful.
[06:56:36] <drakonis> i recall that yumaikas wrote one in go
[06:56:45] <imode> it's very easy to write one.
[06:57:17] <drakonis> a weekend project, basically?
[06:57:34] <imode> basically.
[06:57:36] <drakonis> but how bad is it, really?
[06:57:55] <imode> how bad is what?
[06:58:00] <drakonis> forth
[06:58:03] <imode> not bad.
[06:58:09] <drakonis> that makes people want to shit on it?
[06:58:20] <imode> stack juggling and its looks at first glance.
[06:58:51] <drakonis> fair enough
[07:01:54] <companion_cube> I guess lua has ok syntax for it
[07:03:07] <ngoldbaum>  wow unity bought weta digital

[15:12:21] <edk> pja: it makes sense to me
[15:20:53] <edk> i mean it's pretty clear that 2 log x / log 2x has a positive limit and that replacing either n or m with a constant would leave it with a positive limit
[15:25:03] <edk> i... can't really remember how we proved multi-variable big O in school, but it doesn't seem like there's much room for n and m to grow in a way that's unlike either case
[15:40:10] *** Quits: reneeontheweb (~reneeonth@c188-149-36-100.bredband.tele2.se) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[15:42:47] <riv> pja: it was pretty surprising to me at first
[15:43:03] <riv> the way I understood it was that O(M+N) is the same as O(max(N,M))
[15:43:25] <riv> so O(log(MN)) is the same as max O(max(log(M),log(N)))
[15:44:14] <riv> so if M is bigger, you basically have a multiple of log(M) in both cases
[15:52:24] <prussian> riv: I think you typo'd your earlier post then. you wrote: O(log(N*M)) *and O(log(N+M))*
[15:52:51] <prussian> but ya. I can see the logical implication of what you're saying.
[15:53:27] <riv> the claim is: O(log(N*M)) = O(log(N+M))
[15:54:03] <riv> where this came up was someone made an algorithm that was  O(log(N*M)) and they were disappointed because someone else "beat them" with an O(log(N+M)) algorithm
[15:54:09] <riv> but they were the same algorithm
[15:55:20] <gerikson> lowest O() wins, apparently
[15:57:08] <prussian> b-but. how are lim->Inf of log(N+M) and log(N*M)
[15:57:10] <prussian> same
[15:57:21] <prussian> so confused.
[16:03:09] <riv> I know it's super unintuitive!
[16:05:08] <riv> if M is the larger one, that dominates N then maybe you could write N = c M  for 0 < c < 1, then you have log(c N^2) = log(c) + 2 log(N) vs log(N + c N) = log((1+c)N) = log(1+c) + log(N)
[16:05:38] <riv> log(c) + 2 log(N) ~ log(1+c) + log(N) because you throw away the constant parts, and the  multiplier of 2 is absorbed by big O
[16:15:14] <prussian> good to know.
[16:15:25] <prussian> It looks, ok.

[21:20:22] <drakonis> i see
[21:20:24] <drakonis> fair enough
[21:21:05] <imode> yeah, the neat part about stackish things is that you're operating on a datastructure, vs. passing around a datastructure.
[21:21:19] <imode> so multiple returns just kinda get standardized as "leave stuff behind".
[21:21:41] <drakonis> you're pretty much expecting a data shape then?
[21:21:58] <drakonis> ie: this function will add those returns in a specific order in which you unwind?

[21:22:22] <drakonis> i never fucked around with forth so this is me trying to understand it
[21:22:33] <companion_cube> that's also how a bytecode VM would do
