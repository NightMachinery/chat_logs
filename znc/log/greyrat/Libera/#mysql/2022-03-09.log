[01:14:03] <foobaz212> does anyone know if there is any performance benefit in using Foreign Key? For example http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/2043b8/3 and http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/f25b99/2 Is the latter optimized to be faster, given the same query?

[01:16:10] <thumbs> foobaz212: FK constraints are not about performance
[01:16:30] <foobaz212> i know, it helps in validation of the values
[01:16:38] <foobaz212> but my db doesn't support
[01:17:05] <foobaz212> we can do the validation on the client side, but I am wondering if will incur a penality in perofmrance

[01:25:08] <litheum> foobaz212: your db doesn't support FKs? why not? what do you mean?
[01:26:08] <litheum> FKs can definitely help with performance in *some* cases because, for example, they can facilitate join elimination, but i'm not sure if MySQL has any support for that
[01:30:42] <foobaz212> litheum I am using a proprietary db at company, not too sure actually why foreign keys aren't supported - I just know they aren't. Will invesitgate more

[01:33:28] <foobaz212> another noob question: say the `books` table here was heavily partitioned http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/2043b8/4 I'm aware you can't have a foreign key reference to a partitioned table, but you can still reference them like in the fiddle, right? Put another way, assuming `books` was partitioned and I had `tags ` structured the way it is fiddle, would I
[01:33:29] <foobaz212> encounter any undefined behavior with my query?
[01:50:33] <foobaz212> anyone? :(
[01:58:44] <foobaz212> I\s my question really dumb or sth?:)  No response on #mysql...I'm only wondering this because I know that you can't have a foreign key to a partitioned table. Given this, it seems reasonable to question if it's possible to do an inner join on a partitioned table
[02:04:15] <thumbs> we're busy
[02:04:25] <foobaz212> ok nw
[02:14:53] <litheum> foobaz212: "foreign key" is a logical concept, it describes the relationship between columns. a "foreign key constraint" is a physical concept that can be enforced by the database. in either case, you'll use joins to express foreign key relationships when you query multiple tables in a normalized schema.
[02:15:16] <foobaz212> ok makes sense, thanks
[02:15:26] <litheum> your table is indeed kind of dumb, because if you couldn't do joins, a partitioned table would be truly useless, but you can also just create a simple table yourself and do some testing to see whether or not it works
[02:15:28] <foobaz212> came across this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/507179/does-foreign-key-improve-query-performance
[02:17:45] <foobaz212> hehe that makes sense, thanks for clarifying:)  Yeah, without joins a partitioned table is indeed useless. I was just wondering if there was something I was "missing" something
[02:21:10] <foobaz212> for eg.- there are some dbs that support foreign keys mapping to partitioned table, while others don't. I found that a bit interesting and confusing at the same time. It means I have to think about the implementation-level details about the db to understand whether doing something makes sense. for eg, while I know what paritions are abstractly, I
[02:21:10] <foobaz212> don't know the concrete impl details. So I wasn't sure if it made sense to inner joins that way given that there could be some conflicts with ids or whatnot/idk. Anyway.
