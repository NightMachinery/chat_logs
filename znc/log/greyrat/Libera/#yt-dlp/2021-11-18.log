[08:16:07] <bleb> hellooo
[08:17:23] <bleb> seems that {} in an --exec string used to refer to the relative path of the downloaded file
[08:17:32] <bleb> but now it refers to the absolute path
[08:18:09] <bleb> is there a way to get the relative path now?
[08:18:28] <bleb> and can you fuckers stop making changes that break compatibility
[08:30:19] <opal> are you asking about yt-dlp compared to how youtube-dl did it
[08:30:26] <opal> or does this happen in both
[08:30:39] <opal> >you fuckers
[08:30:47] <opal> i doubt anyone here represents the development
[08:31:13] <opal> to my knowledge all just users
[08:31:17] <opal> me too
[08:37:10] <opal> yeah seeing yt-dlp(1) --exec syntax changed entirely to output template syntax
[08:38:27] <opal> i can try to find a rationale for that
[08:42:54] <opal> well i found the commit at least https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/9de3ea31269c396dabf5b26f92fa65bc99038ede
[08:43:28] <opal> https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/28642
[08:45:26] <opal> doesnt look like its manipulating the filepath differently though, at least not there
[08:45:35] <opal> maybe that got changed in another commit

[18:59:30] <bleb> its really nice to be able to replace youtube-dl with yt-dlp in scripts without changing other stuff
[19:00:01] <bleb> they should have added this as an --exec2 command or something
[19:00:33] <bleb> I guess tom foolery like this is the price you pay for faster development
[19:00:47] <bleb> opal: thanks for investigating
