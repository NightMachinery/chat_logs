[07:34:55] <mute> common golf trick is to use the implied '{print $0}'

[07:39:50] <madprops> what do you mean with implied '{print $0}' ?
[07:40:15] <mute> best i got: awk '$0=$0" "(a+=$0)' e.txt
[07:41:29] <mute> awk is 'pattern { action }'  if you omit action it's { print $0 }
[07:41:47] <madprops> so you modify $0 
[07:41:51] <madprops> and then it prints it
[07:41:52] <mute> so thought assigning to $0 would save some bits but the need for parens around that += didn't help
[07:42:25] <madprops> and you do it outside a { } 
[07:44:17] <mute> yes since it's being used as the "test"

[07:52:58] <mute> # printf %s\\n 67 4 33 | gawk 'a+=$0,$0=$0" "a'
[07:53:00] <shbot> mute: 67 67
[07:53:00] <shbot> mute: 4 71
[07:53:00] <shbot> mute: 33 104
[07:53:48] <mute> same length guess thats best i can do 
[07:53:59] <madprops> ah you increment before
[07:54:03] <madprops> no need for parenthesis
[07:55:06] <madprops> why are operations there separated by comma?
[07:55:10] <madprops> for instance a+=$0,
[07:55:14] <madprops> i would expect ;
[07:55:39] <madprops> because they're outside { } I would guess
[07:55:55] <mute> so typically you have awk 'pattern { action } pattern { action }'
[07:56:14] <mute> hopefully newlines to make it easier to read... but if there is no '{ action }' a ; there is a new pattern
[07:56:19] <mute> so you'd print stuff twice
[07:56:46] <mute> it'd be like:     'a+=$0 { print } $0=$0" "a {print}'
[07:57:19] <madprops> so the second print there replaces the first one?
[07:57:21] <mute> # printf %s\\n 67 4 33 | gawk 'a+=$0;$0=$0" "a'
[07:57:31] <shbot> mute: 67
[07:57:31] <shbot> mute: 67 67
[07:57:31] <shbot> mute: etc... ( http://ix.io/3sVY )
[07:58:55] <mute> awk will evaluate each and do the print for both.
[08:00:12] <mute> it's really a lot stronger language than the one-liners you typically see
[08:00:18] <madprops> oh interesting
[08:00:19] <madprops> awk '$0 ~ 2 {print $0 " $$ "} $0 ~ 9 {print $0 " !!"}' e.txt
[08:00:22] <madprops> didn't know you could do that
[08:00:25] <madprops> multiple patterns
[08:02:35] <mute> and that $0 ~ is also implied when you do like so
[08:02:37] <mute> awk '/2/ {print $0 " $$ "} /9/ {print $0 " !!"}' e.txt
[08:03:08] <mute> # echo 29 | awk '/2/ {print $0 " $$ "} /9/ {print $0 " !!"}'
[08:03:10] <shbot> mute: 29 $$ 
[08:03:10] <shbot> mute: 29 !!
[08:03:21] <mute> does both
[08:03:39] <madprops> i see, so I only would need that if I had to specify a specific field
[08:03:48] <mute> yes
[08:04:01] <madprops> or to match numbers without / /
[08:09:18] <mute> your initial way is best. i just like a code golf challenge..
[08:10:06] <madprops> it seems to me awk is a lot about golfing though
[08:10:09] <mute> and since awk is weird you actually don't need any whitespace in that so i gained nothing

[10:20:39] <madprops> yeti, I got that, but adding 'inplace' removed the error
[10:21:26] <Patsie> '-i inplace' is a gawk special
[10:21:57] <madprops> i guess I'm using gawk then
[10:22:04] <madprops> and awk is an alias
[10:22:05] <Patsie> so yeti is asking you to write: 'gawk -i inplace' instead of 'awk -i inplace'
[10:22:11] <Patsie> yes
[10:22:35] <madprops> though I have both binaries in /usr/bin
[10:22:40] <madprops> are they identical?
[10:22:46] <Patsie> 'they' ?
[10:22:53] <madprops> awk and gawk
[10:23:19] <Patsie> there are multiple versions of awk, most notibly: nawk, mawk, gawk and busybox awk (sometimes oawk too)
[10:23:53] <Patsie> and although they all mostly are doing the POSIX standard, they are definitely not 'identical'
[10:24:14] <madprops> i see /usr/bin/awk and /usr/bin/gawk have the same file size (694 KB)
[10:24:15] <Patsie> gawk being the most 'off center', with a lot of extra features the other awk implementations don't have
[10:24:44] <Patsie> type: /usr/bin/awk -W version
[10:25:05] <madprops> GNU Awk
[10:25:17] <Patsie> then you have two gnu awk binaries for whatever reason
[10:26:31] <madprops> oh I see, awk is a symlink
[10:26:36] <madprops> according to stat
[10:27:07] <Patsie> that sounds more reasonable
[10:27:31] <madprops> I always see people using awk though, not gawk
[10:27:48] <geirha> On a debian or ubuntu system, awk will be symlinked to mawk by default, in which case awk -i inplace will fail
[10:27:55] <Patsie> yes, because 'awk' is the standard, and like I said. all versions mostaly have that standard covered in them
[10:28:40] <madprops> geirha, I'm on ubuntu and awk -i inplace work
[10:28:43] <madprops> s
[10:28:49] <Patsie> but when you use binary specific features, then it is good prectice to specify the binary of the features you're using
[10:29:00] <Patsie> practice*
[10:29:12] <geirha> that's because you've installed gawk later on, and gawk replaces the awk symlink
[10:29:41] <madprops> ah that's likely
[10:29:44] <Patsie> you probably also have /usr/bin/mawk on your system
[10:30:13] <madprops> yeah I do
[10:30:17] <Patsie> and the symlink used to point to that before installing gawk
[10:31:14] <madprops> why would debian pick mawk instead of gawk?
[10:31:31] <Patsie> mawk is considered to be faster than a lot of other awk implementations (most of the time), gawk is considered the most 'feature rich' version, nawk is the-one-true-awk and most 'original'
[10:31:35] <geirha> it's smaller and faster
[10:32:18] <madprops> good to know

[11:06:26] <Patsie> funny to see such a development oriented OS (for a system engineer point of view)
[11:08:18] <Patsie> ohw, so it's not really an OS, it's a container
[11:08:27] <Patsie> yeah, developers love containers
[11:08:29] <siraben> Patsie: it really is very cool, I use it on macOS and NixOS and on top of other distros when their package repositories are outdated
[11:08:41] <siraben> it's not containerized
[11:08:43] <siraben> it's running natively
[11:09:16] <Patsie> The quickest way to install Nix is to open a terminal and run the following command (as a user other than root with sudo permission):
[11:09:19] <Patsie> $ curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
[11:09:21] <Patsie> Make sure to follow the instructions output by the script.  The installation script requires that you have sudo access to root.
[11:09:25] <Patsie> You can uninstall Nix simply by running rm -rf /nix.
[11:09:32] <Patsie> sounds very containerized to me
[11:09:44] <Patsie> you need an OS to install this OS
[11:09:44] <siraben> yeah but the neat part is that it's not!
[11:09:53] <siraben> (or use the ISO)
[11:09:57] <Patsie> and you can remove this OS, by running this command in your native OS
[11:10:09] <siraben> Nix is a package manager, NixOS is the OS
[11:10:12] <siraben> you can use Nix without NixOS

[11:17:05] <siraben> hm what uncommon awk implementations aren't in Nixpkgs
[11:26:39] <siraben> yay hello from GNOME 40
[11:35:24] <madprops> how's gnome 40?
[11:37:23] <siraben> I'm getting FPS drops compared to i3/sway heh
[11:38:55] <madprops> how do you test the fps?
[11:39:52] <siraben> just qualitatively I can feel frames dropping

[11:57:04] <siraben> Patsie: you know, using that curl | sh you can also do a takeover of the host OS
[11:57:05] <siraben> I've used that to convert debian, ubuntu and centos servers into NixOS when I didn't have dashboard access
[11:58:36] <siraben> madprops: i'm going to switch back to sway for the time being, I need to iron out some weird HiDPi issues in GNOME 40
[12:01:10] <siraben> .. and now back in sway
[12:34:10] <madprops> what does gnome have that you miss in sway?

[12:57:29] <siraben> madprops: screen sharing is broken for me on sway
[12:57:41] <siraben> I keep trying various combinations, setting environment variables but doesn't seem to work
[12:58:01] <siraben> at least sway fixes HiDPi woes I have because I use an external display with a lower DPi than my laptop screen
[12:58:11] <siraben> and i3 enforces the same scaling on all displays
[13:42:07] <madprops> can gsub receive flags like 'i' ?
