[00:12:45] <zicada> to remind everyone about that
[00:12:52] <zicada> Fox and Cnn, etc
[00:13:27] <zicada> but in USA the idea is to make money, theyre making more money the more they polarize
[00:13:39] <zicada> does that make it good ? neutral ?
[00:13:40] <zicada> bad ?
[00:15:21] <arryana> you're not likely to find anyone who will engage with intellectually dishonest statements like 'in the usa the idea is to make money'.  oversimplified statements in order to be evocative is just hysteria.

[00:24:07] <spruit11> yah,  but there's no way not to oversimplify.  and I agree with the sentiment,  of all things,  money plays the biggest role in US media
[00:24:14] <zicada> arryana: i agree. Did you struggle to understand what i meant though ? That the US being young and based on individualism and anyone can start with 2 hands and build anything
[00:25:07] <zicada> that plus being anti nobility, it is very much identity-based, as opposed to community-based in the eu sense in many ways
[00:25:18] <zicada> they have their own ways of solving the community thing
[00:25:25] <zicada> some that are excellent
[00:25:26] <spruit11> doesn't look true anymore.  US has poor social mobility and I am not sure I should actually care about that
[00:25:48] <zicada> highschool college "school spirit" type culture, seems pretty much entirey positive

'Rugged individualism' seems to be a myth and most of the US seems to involve carefully selecting what mob you want to belong too.  Be it Harvard or Ryanna.

[02:07:14] <T3ddy> I think ideally, it's healthy to have friends who have opposite views
[02:07:35] <T3ddy> I've just noticed a tendency for the average person to have less tolerance for opposing views these days
[02:07:48] <T3ddy> So while we claim to be more tolerant and compassionate, because we are no longer racist
[02:08:04] <T3ddy> We are still discriminating
[02:08:07] <krb> we always had totally different views yes

[17:18:28] <amigojapan> I am getting the second shot on the 4rth
[17:20:14] <chatguy> congratulations
[17:20:58] <Ungwelian> Well done.
[17:21:07] <Ungwelian> I've got both already. First AZ, then Pfizer.

[17:52:10] *** Quits: genocide (genocide@45.156.23.190) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[17:52:35] <Ungwelian> AZ vaccine raised a fever for one day. Pfizer 2nd vaccine made me tired for a day, along with some muscle pains.
[17:52:39] <Ungwelian> Otherwise felt normal.
[17:53:17] <Ungwelian> I like to think this'll give a more well-rounded protection against the different variants.
[17:53:28] <Ungwelian> AZ is best against the British variant.
[17:53:46] <Ungwelian> Pfizer better against some others.
[17:57:23] <mnemon> it's probably because of the AZ issues
[17:57:36] <mnemon> (the reason they used different ones)
[17:58:28] <Ungwelian> Yeah. Even though the other vaccines have the same problems :P
[17:58:37] <mnemon> really?
[17:58:41] <Ungwelian> Yeah. Pfizer too.
[17:58:53] <mnemon> the bloodclotting issue?
[17:58:53] <Ungwelian> The whole thing was just about getting rid of the sales clause, imo.
[17:58:56] <Ungwelian> Yep.
[17:59:26] <Ungwelian> Most probably AZ sold them with a clause that the sale is final unless there are some unforeseen huge problems.
[17:59:30] <mnemon> there were no known cases at the time AZ issues became a topic.
[17:59:32] <Ungwelian> ...so countries had to come up with some.
[17:59:44] <Ungwelian> Since USA was sitting on 20 million AZ vaccines and not letting them into Europe.
[17:59:53] <Ungwelian> And AZ couldn't deliver more in time.
[17:59:56] <mnemon> seems doubtful
[18:00:08] <Ungwelian> Also, AZ was the cheap vaccine, which seemed good at first.
[18:00:15] <Ungwelian> But like always, rich fucks want to get richer.
[18:00:19] <mnemon> it led to sitting on lots of AZ vaccines
[18:00:29] <Ungwelian> And Pfizer was the US variant.
[18:00:42] <Ungwelian> You haven't been following up at times.
[18:01:19] <mnemon> this just seems too much like an "evil capitalist" conspiracy theory. :D
[18:01:38] <mnemon> makes one suspicious :P
[18:02:26] <mnemon> at the time they confirmed the bloodclotting issues there was no record of similar stuff with pfizer or moderna
[18:02:38] <mnemon> even though they had larger number of jabs iirc

[18:05:00] <ro-bot-o> [url] Myös muiden rokotteiden jälkeen havaittu veritulppia | www.iltalehti.fi
[18:05:10] <kmh> mnemon,  there was but less
[18:05:11] <Ungwelian> No more blood clots from AZ vaccine vs. others.
[18:05:43] <Ungwelian> From the mouth of Petteri Hovi, special investigator of THL.
[18:06:17] <kmh> that's idiotic claim to begin
[18:06:17] <arcturus> how about the heart stuff
[18:06:30] <kmh> as all vaccines vary significantly
[18:06:44] <mnemon> but this is much later, claiming the reason was political at the time they froze AZ is the suspect part :3
[18:07:22] <kmh> i'd argue that that blood clotting claim in incorrect anyhow
[18:08:04] <mnemon> kmh: has there been some additional info about it? they made some connections and even proposed various mechanisms in the earlier times, haven't really followed it more recently though.
[18:08:08] <Ungwelian> And here in English: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/blood-clots-as-prevalent-with-pfizer-and-moderna-vaccine-as-with-astrazenecas-report-2021-04-15
[18:08:08] <ro-bot-o> [url] Blood clots as prevalent with Pfizer and Moderna vaccine as with AstraZeneca's: study - MarketWatch | www.marketwatch.com
[18:08:17] <kmh> mnemon,  yes
[18:08:44] <kmh> there is suggested mechanism by some researchers from university in Germany iirc
[18:08:57] <mnemon> also norwegians
[18:09:21] <kmh> and az blood clotting issue surfaced in several countries and different studies independently
[18:10:24] <kmh> similarly for the J&J which is based on method similar to AZ (virus based)
[18:10:29] <choozy> Hey chatguy
[18:10:57] <kmh> hence i don'r quite get the claim from the finnish guy, that Ungwelian posted
[18:11:20] <chatguy> hey choozy
[18:11:43] <kmh> well an oxford university study oh well
[18:12:01] <mnemon> kmh: the claim is that there does not seem to be any difference based on local numbers
[18:12:05] <Ungwelian> Anything that causes a systemic immune response will carry a bloot clot risk.
[18:12:15] <kmh> i wouldn't take that with grain of salt as they are the makers of AZ
[18:12:34] <mnemon> plus some commentary on the british numbers quoted, commenting on the differences in methodology/grouping.
[18:12:39] <kmh> mnemon,  local number in that study
[18:12:50] <kmh> mnemon,  but apparently not in others
[18:12:52] <Ungwelian> You get immune cells flooding the blood stream. If you have already clogged up veins, the immune response can clog them up completely.
[18:12:53] <choozy> kmh, AstraZenaca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are vector based types
[18:13:02] <kmh> choozy,  yes
[18:13:08] <kmh> virus vector
[18:13:33] <choozy> How are you chatguy?
[18:13:57] <chatguy> not so good. rather lonely and despondent. how about you, choozy?
[18:14:22] <choozy> I'm okay, chatguy
[18:14:34] <chatguy> that's good, choozy
[18:15:28] <choozy> You need some rest chatguy? To get rid of the lonely and despondent feeling? Or meeting up with some people?
[18:17:01] <chatguy> after sleep i will feel a bit less lonely tomorrow, perhaps. but i will end up in the same place again :)
[18:17:17] <chatguy> i don't really have many people to meet up with. that's why i'm here.
[18:17:32] <mnemon> kmh: not sure what you're getting at. the yle article is just essentially just rather neutral commentary about the fact that there does not seem to be any significant effect by vaccines on the usual bloodclot stats
[18:18:07] <kmh> mnemon,  the market watch link
[18:18:26] <mnemon> ah, sec
[18:19:19] <choozy> Ah okay chatguy
[18:19:34] <kmh> and the blood clots chance is rather for all vaccines i'm aware of and is only of concern for certain subpopulations (where the prevalence is higher than normal)
[18:19:49] <kmh> iirc

[23:33:58] <spruit11> maybe it's a bad idea
[23:35:28] <I_Am_M00t> i blame the person who injected the needle

[23:36:32] <spruit11> what shot did you get?
[23:36:39] <spruit11> maybe to direct
[23:36:48] <spruit11> could also blame the system

[23:36:59] <spruit11> or the parents,  that's a good one too
