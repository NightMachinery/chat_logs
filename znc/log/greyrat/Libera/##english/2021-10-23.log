[00:30:55] <silascou_> hello, is this sentence right?
[00:31:21] <silascou_> I'm trying to get more familiar with past continuous ("had"), but I'm not sure if it works here.
[00:31:38] <tinwhiskers> I think you can say that *you* find it very motivating but I don't think you can say it is for anyone.

[03:20:21] <FLHerne> berndj: Why are "thing" or "entity" too abstract?
[03:20:34] <FLHerne> your list of things appears to actually be that abstract :p
[03:20:59] <berndj> Because i don't want to represent rocks or rivers, for example.
[03:21:45] <berndj> I got a worthwhile suggestion in ##programming: "identifiable"
[03:22:31] <FLHerne> I find "identifiable" confusing, I can certainly identify plants and things
[03:22:50] <berndj> FLHerne, even if I did want to represent rocks et al, "thing" or "entity" is just gross because it includes basically anything, and the word would appear absolutely everywhere, making it hard to navigate the source code.
[03:22:54] <FLHerne> I can see the sense it's meant in, but it doesn't seem clear without knowing the background
[03:23:06] <berndj> Yeah, I'm not 100% happy with anything so far.
[03:24:02] <FLHerne> "identity" is the best thing mentioned so far IMO
[03:24:29] <berndj> I guess the one constraint I have is: I want to represent any somewhat stable artifact or phenomenon for which a relatively stable set of natural persons is ultimately responsible
[03:25:44] <berndj> What do spies act on? Targets? That sounds a bit more malevolent than I really want though.
[03:26:06] <LjL> subjects
[03:26:20] <FLHerne> Depending on the context, you could have "subject" or "author"
[03:26:24] <LjL> (disclaimer: i have no idea what you're talking about)
[03:26:25] <FLHerne> but you've probably ruled those out
[03:27:19] <FLHerne> "personality" ?
[03:27:24] <berndj> FLHerne, only "author" is weak, since, for example, a car doesn't write letters.
[03:27:29] <FLHerne> but that's a bit of a stretch for companies
[03:27:42] <FLHerne> wait, why are cars in your set of things?
[03:28:15] <berndj> Because the same one can be spotted in the vicinity of multiple events like crimes for example
[03:28:20] <FLHerne> At that point, there are certainly individual rocks for which I'm personally responsible
[03:28:37] <berndj> hah, but can you identify your rocks?
[03:28:46] <FLHerne> Yeah
[03:29:27] <FLHerne> There's the nice grey one with shell fossils that my Dad gave me, and the white quartz and the pink quartz and the big and small bits of granite
[03:29:44] <FLHerne> I have one with a hole in it

[08:06:09] <pussipupu> Yeah, and once you get that sort of thing stuck it's really hard to break out of
[08:06:54] <pussipupu> Incidentally there's some evidence that if you're trying to remember a word you should specifically avoid telling anyone you ask for help what words you've come up with that don't make the grade, and just stick to descriptions

[09:21:07] <tinwhiskers> the traits, "tenacity, ingenuity, and will to survive" can be compared to to very tough species.

Then the customer replies to me: "Thanks. Do you have anything to go on for the hourly price?". What does that mean? If I have anything to go on for the hourly price?
[18:57:30] <otisolsen70> Does it just mean that she did not notice the price in the SoW? Or does she mean that she wants an estimate of the number of hours? Or anything else? Not sure what this "anything to go on" means.
[18:59:45] <bp99> otisolsen70: I unfortunately do not know that answer to your question, but may I ask what is 'SoW'?

[21:08:44] <Guest54> anyone willing to answer?
[21:11:10] <bp99> Guest54: ‘afraid’ is not a verb
[21:12:14] <bp99> It’s an adjective. You can say ‘John is afraid of snakes’ for example

[21:13:05] <kurahaupo> Bad grammar afraids me 99,99😜
[21:13:07] <Guest54> so since it's an adjective, can we bring gerund after " adjective + preposition" ? as in " Afraid + of "

[21:14:57] <kurahaupo> I'm afraid it's not possible to understand
[21:15:57] <Guest54> kurahaupo ya
[21:16:38] <Guest54> kurahaupo, now, is " adjective + preposition" correct, if gerund comes after this structure ?
[21:17:54] <bp99> You can put both a verb in gerund or in infinitive after ‘afraid’, with slightly different meanings. ‘to be afraid of losing’ means being afraid that the event that one loses happens. ‘to be afraid to eat’ means that one is afraid to engange in the act of eating. I think. I am not sure about the exact difference, and I dont’t think it’s very clearly defined either.
[21:18:24] <Guest54> bp99 Thank you very much!
