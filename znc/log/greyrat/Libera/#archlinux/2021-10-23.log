[00:39:06] <unixquuw> Yessir.
[00:39:13] <unixquuw> I think using rsync would've been easier

[00:40:16] <unixquuw> Actually kinda
[00:40:25] <unixquuw> Okay, what about the rsync thing?

[00:42:52] <Antiz> Also... It may be a dumb question but... I you can't use the terminal or ftp, why don't you simply use a usb key or something like that ?

[00:43:29] <unixquuw> Antiz: well i could too actually
[00:43:49] <Antiz> well, rsync kinda works the same way actually so... it's something like "rsync /path/to/file user@machine:/path/to/destination (with a bunch of available options you can add).
[00:43:58] <unixquuw> alr
[00:43:59] <unixquuw> thakns
[00:44:15] <Antiz> Pretty similar to scp actually. So if you don't like scp for whatever reason, you'll probably don't like rsync either ^^
[00:44:21] <jkc> "i don't like scp" here, use this thing that works just like scp "ok cool"
[00:44:43] <unixquuw> Ill actually try out rsync :^)
[00:44:50] <Antiz> Just in case you wanna give rsync a shot, be aware that it has to be installed on both machines
[00:45:15] <Antiz> Cause it uses its own protocol. So you have to install it on both your source and your destination machines
[00:46:38] <Antiz> Funny tho, if you're okay with rsync but not scp. That's basically the same things (at least in the actual usage). But just use whatever works for you I guess :)

[05:40:26] <ReactorScram> I mean that I don't like dealing with system-wide SSH.

The xeor/borg image on Dockerhub looks like what I have in mind. It can run the server inside a container and then write out to a volume
[05:41:06] <jkc> ReactorScram: ... What are you going on about? Disable password login, key only, set up a borg user, configure an ssh key, and call it a day?
[05:41:13] <jkc> This is not that complex.
[05:41:54] <ReactorScram> setting up a user is annoying, and I don't like when I do some special config to a system and then like 3 years later I don't know how I did it and I can't move it to another system because it's all one-offs. With a container it'll be contained

[09:00:12] <mpan> Thre is no such thing as 100% success ratio for suspend-to-disk, no matter what size of swap you use. That’s because swap size itself is increasing the required size of the pessimistic case.
[09:00:41] <Dunce> ?
[09:00:45] *** Forza_ is now known as Forza
[09:00:47] <mpan> For nearly-100% you need about as much swap as you use memory in nearly-100% cases. Memory, nor RAM.
[09:01:12] <Dunce> That's so much more confusing than matching swap file/partition to RAM size.
[09:01:28] <Dunce> Everyone has the storage capacity.
[09:01:36] <mpan> But that is correct, instad of being a claim witout any foundations. :)
[09:02:12] <Dunce> It isn't a claim, that's a widely accepted consensus.
[09:03:08] <mpan> It’s not a consensus. And something being widely believed doesn’t imply it has any logical foundations. Most people around the world believe in some kind of deity, as an example.

[09:26:13] <ofou> oye por qué esta es la peor distro que existe? 
[09:26:55] <Dunce> I think you're supposed to use English only.
[09:27:18] <Dunce> Weirdly, I feel I can read whatever you're writing though.
[09:27:29] <Dunce> Sort-of like you're asking why is this distro so good or bad?
[09:27:32] <ofou> sorry sorry 
[09:27:37] <ofou> i just get confused 
[09:27:40] <ofou> my bad
[09:27:44] <Dunce> It's all good.
[09:27:48] <ofou> so bad really 
[09:28:03] <Dunce> peor = bad
[09:28:04] <Dunce> Right?
[09:28:19] <ofou> i think so, but maybe I just had a bad experience 
[09:28:21] <Dunce> So, you're asking why it's the worst distro essentially? That's sort-of up to the user.

[09:28:37] <ofou> that's a fair translation 
[09:28:41] <Dunce> Well, your experience is all that matters, so I'd say so.
[09:29:02] <Dunce> Did you try using Arch as your first distro?
[09:29:22] <ofou> why would you say are the pros of it? 
[09:29:38] <ofou> it was Ubuntu 
[09:29:48] <ofou> my first one

[09:31:01] <ofou> I'll give it another try though 
[09:31:39] <ofou> (sorry for spanish comment, it was intended for the spanish community)
[09:32:42] <Dunce> I'm sorry for late response.
[09:33:05] <Dunce> The pros of a distro will probably be subjective, based on what you're using it for.
[09:34:09] <Dunce> I wanted to learn more about computers in general, so I chose Arch to force my hand in a way. If I got confused, I tried hard to find my answers in the wiki before asking. If I was looking for a distro for gaming, then I would probably use something else, for example. That's just me though.
[09:35:37] <Dunce> What you need to realize is Linux isn't Windows, you may have grown up using that and you're used to things sort-of just "working." That will probably not be the case your first few times installing Arch.

[09:40:55] <thurstylark> he uses fedora or some rh flavor iirc
[09:41:04] <thurstylark> he doesn't fuck with userland stuff so much
[09:41:11] <ofou> I've used Ubuntu for a couple of years, but now I switched for macos
[09:41:22] <Dunce> ofou, he uses Fedora.
[09:41:36] <ofou> oooh you're right
[09:41:42] <ofou> that was the one
[09:41:42] <Dunce> Also, the differences between the distributions are huge.
[09:41:47] <Dunce> Especially if you use different families.
[09:41:57] <enyc> Dunce: funny thing is, for  pop-os-gaming  at least  asa distro  things sort-of-just "work"  a lot anyhow,  in ways moreso than windows installing,  depends on specifics of course but in ways that has changed.
[09:42:09] * thurstylark moved to arch after getting fed up with fighting against ubuntu's defaults when customizing stuff

[09:43:00] <thurstylark> I can't get enough of chimera os for gaming
[09:43:10] <Dunce> Those are like what distros are based on, if I remember correctly.
[09:43:18] <enyc> thurstylark: sure, makes sense.  Similarly some like mint or other derivs to change defaults for them in ways
[09:43:22] <Dunce> There's a cool graph online about it.
[09:43:56] <ofou> you guys just use arch? 
[09:44:08] *** Joins: reumeth (~reumeth@user/reumeth)
[09:44:21] <Dunce> enyc, I didn't mean that all linux distros don't work out-the-box, but Arch is a little different. I'd recommend Manjaro to a new user, but people don't seem to like that here, so I lay off.
[09:45:01] <Dunce> I would advise people to use something that just "works," and then transition with some experience using the command-line, etc.
[09:45:03] <thurstylark> enyc: yeah, but it was more than just changing the defaults, it was the fact that there *were* defaults. If I had to change machines and couldn't properly transfer my environment, I would have to remember everything that I changed and re-do it. If I'm gonna be doing that, I might as well just remember everything I did to set up my arch install in the first place, and take advantage of the arch
[09:45:05] <thurstylark> wiki directly to boot
[09:45:05] <enyc> Dunce: I guess arch is somewhat gentoo-like or so, in that niche or so.
[09:45:27] <Dunce> gentoo-like, but simpler, in my opinion.
[09:45:49] <enyc> Dunce: hrrm [ok]
[09:46:09] <Dunce> I wouldn't know, just to be clear.
[09:46:16] <thurstylark> and like, it's not the answer to everything. I don't really want to fuck with a server like that too much, so I have debian servers in my personal fleet for some things
[09:46:18] <Dunce> I read the wiki, and stuck with Arch.

[15:32:35] <orangeFlu> ok, so i need help with something. basically i tried to set up a daily back-up kind of thing with rsync. This back-up is meant to be done on an hdd of mine. Check if hdd is present and mounted and make a back-up on it. Problem is, I didn't make a separate folder on the hdd for that, and when i tested it, it erased all my already existing files there

[16:17:09] <orangeFlu> Ironically, the whole problem stemmed from the fact that I was setting up a back-up script for my system, and the place I chose to back-up to, had files that were not backed up
[16:17:16] <jkc> And as far as backups go, here's a rule of backups: If the same single event (e.g. your house burning down) can destroy both your actual data and your backups, then you don't have backups.
[16:17:20] <orangeFlu> Really weird idea on my part
[16:17:47] <orangeFlu> Yes, I know, this is just the first step, I am looking also for off-site back-ups

[16:18:11] <jkc> How much actual data are you trying to back up? Not fs size, actual data.
[16:18:31] <orangeFlu> Weirdly, it all started because I saw a guy on reddit who "rm -rf /*"-ed
[16:18:51] <orangeFlu> Maybe something like 100 GB at this point, my system is not that big
[16:19:10] <jkc> rsync.net with the borg discount is $18/year for 100GB.
[16:19:20] <jkc> 1.5 cents per gig after that.

[16:21:10] <jkc> I use restic, personally.

[16:50:08] <thrice> usually they aren't recommended for most cases
[16:50:41] <marcello42> I see I thought the other way round.. I assume, now, they are priporitary and the open source driver might work as good as not even better or am I wrong?

[17:03:53] <marcello42> ok this is odd... well I also rebooted with the fallback initramfs, but same.. mouse  gets stuck on the left side.. but apparently this has to do w/ the video driver, since with the intel video driver it does not occur.. How can I reinstall the 'regular' video driver?
[17:04:12] <marcello42> but seems like the flickering is gone, which is also odd :D

[18:55:29] <ectospasm> orangeFlu: it depends on how you made the backup.
[18:55:45] <ectospasm> What backup tool did you use?
[18:55:50] <orangeFlu> rsync

[18:56:07] <jkc> Because my examples were restic.

[19:39:42] <unixquuw> Hello arch peeps. Ive got a another issue, this time it's a terminal's issue. Is it possible to display unicode emojis in my terminal? For example this emoji "🤣". Thanks
[19:39:58] <ectospasm> unixquuw: what terminal emulator?
[19:40:37] <unixquuw> ectospasm: Im using xterm right now, but i can switch to any if xterm cant handle it.
[19:41:10] <ectospasm> I haven't run xterm in a while, I'd bet it can't.  But it may depend on your font
[19:41:26] <teraflops> xterm cannot afaik
[19:42:05] <unixquuw> Okay, cool. Sooo what about lets say Urxvt.
[19:42:10] <unixquuw> can it display emojis?
[19:42:23] <ectospasm> It should be able to, the U in Urxvt means Unicode...
[19:42:33] <ectospasm> I haven't run Urxvt in a while, though
[19:43:16] <teraflops> no idea about *rxvt either
[19:43:25] <unixquuw> Alrighty, will see what can i do.
[19:43:40] <unixquuw> Also question about the fonts, does it need to be some font like nerd-font?
[19:43:48] <unixquuw> because they've got all of those fancy glyphs

[23:38:37] <SysGhost> is it an app image? unpack it, change the permissions of it as described, and then repack it

[23:39:19] <SysGhost> one can run with  --no-sandbox option, but that is a bad solution.
[23:40:40] <shibboleth> snap/flatpak/"images" like that seems... un-"archy"?
[23:41:01] <SysGhost> I also suspect you'd get a much better result if it's done without yay
[23:41:12] <shibboleth> kinda like... using apt/rpm on gentoo :P
[23:42:05] <ectospasm> Wouldn't that be dpkg/rpm?
[23:42:17] <SysGhost> shibboleth: snap and flatpak are not great imho. App Images however. it has no requirements on the system itself and runs simply by setting the executable flag.

[23:43:53] <kpcyrd> is there a difference if makepkg is run manually or by yay? it sounds like a package problem
[23:44:32] <teraflops> try it and see I guess
[23:44:49] <teraflops> that's the first thing I'd do id it fails when using an aur helper
[23:45:07] <teraflops> id/if

[23:47:01] * CarloWood thinks back to the time that "I can't remember the last time that I ..." had a different meaning... but can't really remember when that was.
[23:47:46] <teraflops> unixquuw: grep?
[23:47:57] <unixquuw> so fc-list | grep "nerd"
[23:47:59] <unixquuw> right?
[23:48:29] <unixquuw> nvm it was grep -i "nerd" lol
[23:48:44] <teraflops> even easier, fc-list N^press tab
[23:48:51] <teraflops> it does autocomplete
[23:49:05] <teraflops> stop at the fist :and press enter
[23:50:02] <unixquuw> vim thinks it's funny to stop me from pasting via the ctrl+shift+insert bruh

[23:50:44] <ectospasm> I just do Ctrl-v and such.
[23:50:53] <unixquuw> wait anyone here using kitty terminal?

[23:52:18] <unixquuw> and im just kinda falling asleep on my chair listening to sea shanties
[23:52:21] <SysGhost> shibboleth: all of em have that nasty thing going for em: devs get lazy and stick with one statick built environment. They don't have to change and adapt for changes and updates except for their own. In a way I understand that. But...
