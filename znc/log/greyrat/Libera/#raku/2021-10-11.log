[04:50:05] <pony> or rather, make $<sub-token>.map(*.made)

[08:46:52] <mfiano> I noticed there are only two Raku books published since the name was changed, and neither seem to be a beginner walkthrough book that most languages have available. I am guessing one of the slightly older books on "Perl 6" would be more appropriate, but given the time span Perl 6 has been a thing, I'm not sure which book would be the best for me to look into buying. Anyone have any ideas?

[19:38:31] <leont> Then it seems something bitrotted, I'll have a look
[19:39:35] <dogbert17> thx, do you want me to report it as an issue in the TAP/Harness repo?
[19:44:45] <leont> It rather sounds like the issue is in the rakudo repo
[19:46:01] <[Coke]> anyone know if there's a repo for the "raku ci bot grant" ?
[19:46:19] <[Coke]> (or is it not that kind of grant)
[19:48:42] <leont> dogbert17: actually, I think you found a regression in rakudo itself
[19:49:05] <leont> ./rakudo-m -e 'dd $_ for  "t".IO.dir(:test(none($*SPEC.updir, $*SPEC.curdir, ".git")))'
[19:49:37] <leont> That returns a junction of sequences, instead of a sequence
[19:51:59] <leont> I'm guessing Rakudo::Iterator::Dir takes an Any instead of a Mu as argument. That would result in exactly what we're seeing here
[19:55:16] *** Joins: euandreh (~euandreh@191.181.59.160)
[19:55:21] <lizmat> should it take a Mu ?
[19:55:47] <leont> IMO it should. Anything that generically tests should.

[20:49:31] <dogbert17> now it works again :) lizmat++, leont++
[20:53:49] <leont> Seems I have to fix another small issue, I should use RAKULIB=lib instead of raku -Ilib, otherwise some things fail
[21:04:15] <dogbert17> I have run both 'make test' and 'make spectest' with HARNESSTYPE=6 and there are some tests being flagged as failed when they shouldn't for some reason

[21:06:05] <dogbert17> but it could very well be due to the issue that leont mentions above

[22:02:25] <melezhik> i wonder if Raku people are interested in adding Raku projects and reviews them on https://mybf.io ? I am testing this idea. I see it like yet another resource to spread a knowledge about Raku and show  other - it's real usage
[22:03:25] <melezhik> I've made reviews for some of chosen modules recently just to show how it could look like 
[22:04:41] <melezhik> the benefit is mybfi.io site is not only for Raku, so other people visiting it might start paying attention .... just a thought ... maybe not a perfect idea ...
[22:06:26] <lizmat> melezhik: it always takes time before there's a critical mass  :-)
[22:07:05] <melezhik> yeah, I know, I know ))) I even ready for the idea to wrap the project up if it does go very well, but let's see
[22:08:04] <melezhik> I am still in research - whether it is a good idea or not to allow people publicly review open source software, in the end of they day we have GH issues for that )))
[22:09:05] <melezhik> however this is something different -  just to allow people quickly share there thought on certain piece of software not necessarily tide to any particular issue or feature
[22:10:00] <melezhik> the advantage is quick feedback for a software author as well as to help people make better choices before start using tool A or tool B
[22:10:41] <melezhik> and I know there is a reddit for that, but sometimes reddit is  a bit too biased, on my view at least ...
[22:11:14] <[Coke]> It seems a reasonable idea, but the fact that it's separated from the package management system (right?) of the various languages' modules makes it ad hoc, yes?
[22:13:27] <melezhik> lizmat sorry for that typo " to wrap the project up if it does go very well" -> " to wrap the project up if it does NOT go very well,"
[22:13:50] <lizmat> melezhik: yeah, figured that  :-)
[22:14:00] <melezhik> yeah )))
[22:24:04] <colemanx> I often find myself just searching github - exclusively - when I need a library; i'd like alternatives and other aggregators across the different software forges
[22:24:28] <melezhik> colemanx ++
[22:25:44] <melezhik> the idea is to give an  information on a certain software something in between "way too technical" and "way too marketish" , something from an ordinary ends user view ... ))) 
[22:27:24] <colemanx> I might suggest renaming the category "infrastructure as a code" to simly "Infrastructure as Code"
[22:27:47] <colemanx> or even IaC, which is a common abbreviation
[22:33:28] <melezhik> colemanx - thanks, I changed to a "infrastructure as code"
[22:33:44] <melezhik> i keep it lowercase so far, as other categories have it
[22:33:53] <colemanx> Nice; cool website, by the way :)

[23:28:59] <El_Che> d
[23:29:18] <melezhik> oh, so they know you write Raku code?
[23:29:38] <El_Che> somewhat
[23:29:47] <El_Che> I will ever be know as the Perl guy
[23:29:50] <El_Che> for
[23:30:07] <melezhik> ok, I see ... Many people still don't see the difference )))
[23:30:09] <El_Che> nowdays I mostly write Go and Raku when possible
[23:30:18] <melezhik> oh, cool
[23:30:36] <melezhik> I made some reviews for go tools on mybfio recently ...
[23:31:10] <melezhik> I even run a golang contest, sorry for the off topic ))) 
[23:31:52] <melezhik> honestly after Perl and Raku, every time I try to write something on go, I struggle with it's syntax
[23:32:08] <El_Che> go is a great complement for Raku: they are so far apart that it's easy to step in a different mindset when writing in the other language
[23:32:08] <melezhik> I know one binary and stuff it is all cool
[23:32:30] <melezhik> but the syntax, maybe I am just not used to that ...
[23:32:49] <El_Che> Syntax is clean and easy to master once you're used to it
[23:33:00] <melezhik> yeah , they are a far for sure ...
[23:33:05] <El_Che> but for lots of stuff you need to write extra code
[23:33:22] <melezhik> I mean not syntax itself, but kinda feeling - it's minimalism ...
[23:33:23] <El_Che> in contrast with raku's stdlib
[23:33:29] <melezhik> that bothers me ...
[23:33:34] <El_Che> (on the other hand, they have lots of libs)
[23:33:44] <melezhik> asceticism if you  will .. 
[23:33:48] <melezhik> yeah they do

[23:34:47] <melezhik> "but for lots of stuff you need to write extra code " - and that the thing, I don't want to ))) I am lazy ... I need a language to do that ...
[23:35:05] <El_Che> melezhik: I did some java in the past, but I can stomach writing it nowadays
[23:35:30] <El_Che> melezhik: you end up having a lot of ready code after a while
[23:36:18] <melezhik> yes you do and you master the language itself, but I don't know ... my recent mindset I am a bit tired of mastering things, I just want to use them )))
[23:36:20] <El_Che> but I agree that for stuff like "is this element part of this array" is completely silly to write a loop every time
[23:36:32] <melezhik> here we are )))
[23:36:42] <El_Che> and wat kills me, is that you need one for each type
[23:36:51] <El_Che> (they are working on the generics though)
[23:37:16] <melezhik> yeah, that's a drawback of static typed languages I guess? I am not too sure though ...
[23:37:41] <El_Che> with the risks of making the code less readable (that's why many oppose the planned inclusion of generics in 2.0)
[23:37:57] <El_Che> melezhik: no, java and c# have generics
[23:38:10] <El_Che> go also has generics in the internal library
[23:38:16] <El_Che> but not exposed for the user
[23:38:52] <melezhik> ok ... I probably know what generic are . I mean the thing people try to solve using generic, We don't have them in dynamically typed languages, huh?
[23:38:57] <El_Che> it was a choice to keep the language simple
[23:39:32] <El_Che> melezhik: well, raku is somewhere in the middle :)

[23:40:11] <melezhik> yeas, it reminds the pattern, when I start with a SIMPLE design, over time I get challenges from business logic and temptation to make may design more complex to adapt those challenges ...  
[23:40:34] <melezhik> it happens in general with every design, not just a language ...
[23:40:38] <El_Che> melezhik: nothing a good refactoring can't fix :)
[23:41:02] <El_Che> but, Go 1 has been very stable code support wise
