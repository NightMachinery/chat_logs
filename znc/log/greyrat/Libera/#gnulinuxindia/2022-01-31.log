[16:57:45] <gtlsgamr> by the way I have a project that I think I will start soon. I am going to port my shell script static site generator to C, once I learn C that is
[16:57:50] <gtlsgamr> so stay tuned folk!
[16:57:54] <gtlsgamr> bye bye
[16:58:39] <Tor[m]> gtlsgamr: Avjo and don't forget to hydrate 
[17:30:12] <relejek[m]> <gtlsgamr> "by the way I have a project that..." <- aye!! i would like to follow that. my C is dusty yet me thinks that i could contribute. otherwise i would definitely learn file and text manipulation
[18:47:12] <gtlsgamr> what are good pdf viewer?
[18:47:16] <gtlsgamr> mnml but not zathura
[18:50:04] <gtlsgamr> never mind
[18:50:05] <gtlsgamr> got it
[18:51:38] <relejek[m]> gtlsgamr:  i use xreader. simple and light
[19:09:17] <AryaK> zathura
[19:09:22] <AryaK> kitty has 
[19:09:32] <AryaK> https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/cozf3a/kittypdf_command_line_pdf_viewer_using_pymupdf/

[20:31:25] <gtlsgamr> whats up folk
[20:31:46] <gtlsgamr> http://0x0.st/oHfg.png
[20:31:57] <gtlsgamr> I am solving these in C. You should try too if you want. It looks fun
[20:40:54] <relejek[m]> <gtlsgamr> "http://0x0.st/oHfg.png" <- why does these exercises seem like they want to make you build a Compiler of some sorts!!
[21:00:24] <NeoVoid[m]1> good night everyone
[21:07:22] <MohdAariz[m]> good night
[21:18:35] <gtlsgamr> relejek[m]: it does seem like so. one of the authors of this book is the creator of C language so I guess that makes sense
[21:33:35] <Tor[m]> Good pdf editor which can add photos and is FOSS
[21:36:51] <relejek[m]> Tor:  can't say how useful it is going to be for you yet i use 'master pdf editor' for nominal editing. i hope it helps. ig it is FOSS.
[21:38:53] <relejek[m]> https://github.com/ShizukuIchi/pdf-editor
[21:38:53] <relejek[m]> there is also this.
[21:39:42] <NeoVoid[m]1> <JustArnav[m]> "intitle:"Index of" filetype:..." <- use gen.lib.rus.ec
