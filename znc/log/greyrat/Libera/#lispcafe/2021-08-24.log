[01:52:55] <selwyn> i have a beer here i would like to drink
[01:53:22] <selwyn> but if i do, i have very little chance of getting through this physics video i want to watch
[01:54:24] <selwyn> well, decision made
[01:55:34] <gilberth> selwyn: Exactly what kind of beer do you have, that it would make it hard to follow a video? And: Cheers!
[01:55:47] <selwyn> cheers *clink*

[01:56:10] <selwyn> in practice if i have any alcohol at all i find it very hard to concentrate on science
[01:56:47] <gilberth> I slept in. I couldn't get to rest yesterday, damn pain I keep having.
[01:58:13] <selwyn> get well soon gilberth
[01:58:16] <gilberth> Anyhow, I feel like I could need a rest from my itty CLIM implementation.
[01:58:50] <gilberth> selwyn: I need patience. I am way better than in January. It just takes time.
[01:59:40] <gilberth> Not drinking alcohol at all helps and living here at my cousin's place is a life saver.

[02:51:10] <Jacobis9000> hi!
[02:51:18] <lotuseater> hi Jacobis9000 :)
[02:51:42] <Jacobis9000> I've just discovered LISP
[02:51:46] <lotuseater> nice
[02:51:54] <Jacobis9000> it looks cool
[02:52:01] <lotuseater> which one specifically?
[02:52:20] <lotuseater> it not just looks so, it is :)
[02:53:03] <Jacobis9000> I would like to learn it, I think
[02:53:54] <lotuseater> so which dialect do you got to know recently?
[02:54:49] <Jacobis9000> oh I have not got that far into my investigations
[02:55:03] <Jacobis9000> I got distracted by the Freenode gossip
[02:56:17] <Jacobis9000> I am going to read CLiki
[02:56:23] <lotuseater> most times we talk about Common Lisp or comparations to other more widely known languages but everything is welcome
[02:57:01] <gilberth> Lisp is off-topic here :-)
[02:57:19] <lotuseater> there are also in bigger use variations of Scheme like Racket, then Clojure or Emacs Lisp
[02:57:30] <lotuseater> gilberth: yes ^^
[02:58:21] <gilberth> Yes, one worse than the other. I don't even consider Scheme a Lisp.
[02:58:28] <lotuseater> :D
[02:58:54] <lotuseater> the reasons why would interest me if you want to share
[02:59:16] <gilberth> I mean, elisp? Seriously? Has it closures yet? It has, but you need to set a magic variable to have them. I prefer when functions are first class.
[03:00:01] <hayley> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgXozIma-Oc
[03:00:01] -ixelp- Time - YouTube
[03:00:27] <lotuseater> yeah right, I just meant it in the sense, when people use Emacs, so it's more or less a DSL
[03:00:36] <lotuseater> hayley: time flows ^^
[03:00:42] <gilberth> And why isn't Emacs written in elisp, to begin with?
[03:01:06] <lotuseater> I don't know. Ask Richard Stallman.
[03:01:58] <lotuseater> Rainer Joswig mentions in his radio interview from 2011 that there was also Interlisp with interesting ideas beside the MacLisp family, but it ran out of money.
[03:02:35] <gilberth> He does not seem to believe in Lisp. Read the original proposal for the GNU project. It mentions writing things in Lisp. Didn't happen, instead the GNU project is a bunch of UNIX tools, written in C.
[03:02:56] <selwyn> ´if lisp is so great why isn´t emacs written in elisp´ should be one of those turning point memes
[03:03:02] <Jacobis9000> Ah I've got to go bed, work tomorrow, but I'll make a note of this channel and CLiki
[03:03:15] <lotuseater> hm but some of them also use eg Guile Scheme for certain stuff
[03:03:27] <lotuseater> Jacobis9000: you're welcome
[03:04:05] <Jacobis9000> ah I will do the DIY Development Setup
[03:04:10] <Jacobis9000> what exactly is Emacs?
[03:04:18] <Jacobis9000> I know it, but I've forgotten
[03:04:29] <gilberth> selwyn: I once considered porting Emacs to CL. But two things stopped me: (1) The Emacs gang somehow does not like CL (2) The parts written in C are huge. Ironically you often find comments that some C functions were written in elisp initially.
[03:04:31] <lotuseater> maybe Stallman more wanted to achieve popularity for GNU
[03:04:57] <Jacobis9000> oh the text editor
[03:05:02] <gilberth> idk and frankly I don't care.
[03:05:08] <selwyn> gccemacs seems to be the most achievable solution
[03:05:18] <selwyn> amusing that emacs seems to be converging on ecl

[03:05:26] -ixelp- Steel Bank Common Lisp / [Sbcl-devel] Extension documentation.
[03:05:33] <lotuseater> Jacobis9000: Emacs is firstly (for most people) a text editor, then an IDE, but also some kind of meta operating system that you not only can configure but reprogram as it runs.
[03:05:35] <aeth> "We are studding the remote possibility to use SBCL in the future as an
[03:05:41] <aeth> "alternative to the internal Elisp compiler in emacs."

[03:05:56] <selwyn> aeth: yeah and look what happened to that
[03:05:57] <gilberth> But Hemlock lives. At least CCL adopted my "portable Hemlock" And it lives in Lispworks too.
[03:05:59] <selwyn> 2019 as you say
[03:06:06] <Jacobis9000> woah really lotuseater?
[03:06:12] <lotuseater> Jacobis9000: yes :)
[03:06:19] <Jacobis9000> sounds cool
[03:06:22] <selwyn> jacobis9000: nearly all of us use emacs as a lisp ide
[03:06:49] <lotuseater> so in a sense "modern" IDEs like IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code that are popular converge to some kind of Emacs
[03:07:21] <Jacobis9000> Well so far I have programmed in: MUSHCode, C, and Python
[03:07:27] <lotuseater> cool
[03:07:45] <lotuseater> i will look up MUSHCode
[03:07:52] <gilberth> Anyhow, I saw no way that an Emacs rewritten in CL would gain popularity in any way. So it would have been a wasted effort. My plan was to compile the C to CL to get started.
[03:08:17] <lotuseater> ahh
[03:08:31] <Jacobis9000> well I heard today in conversation that MUSHCode had been compared to LISP, so I looked up LISP, lol that is how I got here
[03:09:52] <Jacobis9000> ok cool I'll get eMacs set up for LISP development, it runs from the terminal right? 
[03:09:58] <Jacobis9000> Emacs
[03:10:04] <hayley> no, you need a teletype for LISP
[03:10:10] <Jacobis9000> lol
[03:10:10] <lotuseater> nope, it's a "real" IDE
[03:10:19] <gilberth> hayley: That's ed(1).
[03:10:38] <lotuseater> hayley: I thought we program with unleashing butterflies?
[03:10:51] <hayley> You need a 30 year old financial company for Clojure, and a MIT for Scheme.
[03:11:22] <hayley> And you need a clue-by-four to the head for Hy, Fennel, Janet, newLISP, etc, etc.
[03:11:26] <gilberth> Jacobis9000: It took Emacs years to move away from terminals, but these days you could use it with a window system.
[03:11:50] <lotuseater> Jacobis9000: this line about MUSHCode triggers me "functional programming the really hard way"
[03:12:00] <hayley> ZWEI was fine, but GNU Emacs took its time.
[03:12:13] <selwyn> return to (ed)
[03:12:25] <GreaseMonkey> Hy would be neat if it wasn't so damn slow
[03:12:33] <lotuseater> when will VIER release?
[03:12:46] <gilberth> selwyn: Not ed(1)?
[03:12:50] <lotuseater> GreaseMonkey: if one wants to use it with python yes

[03:13:52] <selwyn> gilberth: oh seriously? cool!
[03:14:01] <gilberth> selwyn: Which I actually used for a while. Way snappier than Emacs.
[03:14:26] <gilberth> selwyn: CCL adopted my portable Hemlock. And Lispworks uses it too.
[03:14:47] <selwyn> i know it is not everyone´s first choice, but #´ed is the silliest part of the clhs for me
[03:14:56] <gilberth> Hemlock contained a lot of CMUCLisms and I once removed these.

[03:27:52] <selwyn> it still gets used in symbolic ai

[03:36:30] <lotuseater> i should try that now with april
[03:39:07] <Jacobis9000> cool LISP can work with fractions
[03:39:23] <lotuseater> yes :)
[03:40:05] <lotuseater> and with complex numbers
[03:40:32] <Jacobis9000> not had enough mathematical education to know what complex numbers are
[03:40:33] <lotuseater> if we mean Common Lisp
[03:40:51] <Jacobis9000> right catch you tomorrow!
[03:40:52] <lotuseater> that's ok
[03:40:54] <aeth> Not perfectly, unfortunately. Non-integer exponents in EXPT as well as some functions like SQRT, EXP, etc., will turn your rationals into floats.
[03:41:20] <aeth> I guess otherwise they'd need precision except on rare edge cases, though
[03:41:20] <moon-child> that's semi-reasonable
[03:41:57] <aeth> I suppose ISQRT gives you enough
[03:41:59] <moon-child> 99% of the time, the result wouldn't be rational anyway
[03:42:18] <aeth> (- (sqrt 5) (isqrt 5)) => 0.23606801
[03:42:23] <selwyn> have to say am a bit disappointed that (sqrt 25/4) doesn´t give a rational answer
[03:42:25] <lotuseater> the end result
[03:42:29] <moon-child> the alternative is symbolic representation.  Which is cool, but
[03:42:46] <lotuseater> so if needed you can write symbolic versions for used functions
[03:43:10] <hayley> https://github.com/cooperativesource/about/discussions/5 Please upvote this zkat has been ghosting me
[03:43:10] -ixelp- There already is a Cooperative Software License · Discussion #5 · cooperativesource/about · GitHub
[03:43:28] <moon-child> something else that would be cool though is bigfloat ball arithmetic
[03:43:33] <selwyn> or indeed (sqrt 5). but i suppose you eventually just want speed in your (sqrt) and not waste time figuring out if things are perfect squares or not
[03:43:36] <aeth> selwyn: You can take the NUMERATOR and DENOMINATOR of 25/4 and then ISQRT both parts and if both parts (zerop (- (SQRT number) (ISQRT number))) return the ISQRT/ISQRT
[03:43:47] <aeth> Not particularly fast, though
[03:44:06] <aeth> And you might want to choose an espilon to tolerate
[03:44:17] <moon-child> better to square the isqrt and see if it compares equal to the number
[03:44:24] <hayley> (rationalize (sqrt 5))
[03:44:37] <moon-child> no need to involve floating point in the first place if you just want to deal with integers
[03:44:40] <moon-child> (/rats)
[03:44:44] <aeth> hayley: good point
[03:44:52] <Jacobis9000> MUSHCode would call T and NIL booleans, but LISP calls them predicates
[03:45:22] <hayley> Um, no it wouldn't.
[03:45:30] <moon-child> lisp calls T and NIL symbols.  It calls functions like ZEROP predicates
[03:45:38] <hayley> A function which returns something to be used as "true" or "false" is a predicate.
[03:45:51] <aeth> (defun qsqrt (rational) (/ (rationalize (sqrt (numerator rational))) (rationalize (sqrt (denominator rational)))))
[03:45:57] <aeth> (qsqrt 25/16) => 5/4
[03:45:57] <lotuseater> and what T (or better: ⊤) really is should be discussed another time :)
[03:46:02] <Jacobis9000> pretty sure the helpfiles call them booleans in MUSHCode let me check
[03:46:08] <moon-child> lotuseater: hahhha
[03:46:17] <aeth> well, qsqrt or rsqrt. 'q' commonly stands for 'rational' in math
[03:46:31] <aeth> but I guess if isqrt used similar reasoning, it'd be zsqrt, since 'z' commonly stands for 'integer' in math
[03:46:33] <Jacobis9000> oh no they don't lol
[03:46:41] <lotuseater> moon-child: :)
[03:46:43] <Jacobis9000> that's me getting it wrong
[03:46:51] <aeth> for comparison, (qsqrt 26/16) => 31016949/24331696
[03:47:20] <lotuseater> Jacobis9000: every value that is not NIL is considered true
[03:48:15] <aeth> every value that is (NOT NIL), (NULL NIL), (ENDP NIL), and quite a few other combinations are considered true 
[03:48:44] <lotuseater> (symbolic-sqrt 2) => '(sqrt 2); (symbolic-sqrt 1/4) => 1/2
[03:49:14] <lotuseater> that rationalize thing would make it unprecise in between calculations too
[03:50:17] <gilberth> Don't use ENDP to ask for falsehood.
[03:50:33] <aeth> you either (a) rationalize numerator and denominator (perhaps converting to double-float/long-float first for extra precision), (b) rationalize the result of directly SQRT (again perhaps converting first), or (c) write your own SQRT
[03:50:34] <moon-child> (let ((tn (isqrt (numerator rat))) (td (isqrt (denominator rat)))) (if (and (= (* tn tn) (numerator rat)) (= (* td td) (denominator rat))) (/ tn td) `(sqrt ,rat)))
[03:50:40] <aeth> in the case of (c) you'd have to provide a precision
[03:52:03] <lotuseater> so you don't deal with symbolic expressions at all, at most just rationals
[03:52:45] <lotuseater> moon-child: yes exactly something like that but combining things would need more effort
[03:53:47] <moon-child> yeah
[03:55:23] <lotuseater> or when you have something like (lambda (x) (expt (sqrt x) 2)) maybe it will be precise enough for your need when normally calculating in double floats
[03:55:54] <lotuseater> moon-child: so generic functions are of great use
[03:56:04] <aeth> moon-child: I thought about that a while ago but you don't want isqrt on a rational, or even just a numerator/denominator of one
[03:56:20] <aeth> at least, without taking into account the remainder
[03:56:56] <aeth> If you do deal with isqrt, too, you'd have to take the sign, since ISQRT assumes positive
[03:57:11] <aeth> well, you probably wouldn't want a complex, but maybe you would
[03:57:14] <lotuseater> a good throw-in :)

[04:29:52] <kakuhen> gilberth: I noticed man was producing files in /tmp, which wasn't normal behavior for my computer
[04:30:07] <kakuhen> so I decided to run makewhatis without first checking "which makewhatis"
[04:30:23] <kakuhen> apparently macports adds /opt/local/sbin/ to PATH, so I ran some mystery meat makewhatis that trashed my database

[04:31:04] <gilberth> Oops. So now man doesn't find anything?
[04:31:08] <kakuhen> Yeah
[04:31:15] <kakuhen> The database is just empty now
[04:31:39] <kakuhen> Or maybe the database is corrupted and man, being a UNIX utility, silently fails rather than telling you what is actually wrong. :)
[04:32:16] <gilberth> Can't you rebuild the whatis db?

[05:14:27] <kakuhen> something is somehow shadowing my /etc/man.conf because it's using the wrong pager and pulling an absurd manpath out of thin air
[05:14:55] <kakuhen> instead of using less, it's using more; and my manpath is huuuge and contains various things not listed in /etc/man.conf, not in /etc/manpaths.d

[05:15:13] <kakuhen> yes
[05:15:31] <kakuhen> also I really dislike whoever came up with the idea of "let's make configuration with .d directories and make people create files prepended with magic numbers for configuration to work" 
[05:15:53] <kakuhen> like, /etc/manpaths.d/40-XQuartz, really????
[05:16:21] <kakuhen> oh my god turns out there is an /opt/local/bin/man
[05:16:33] <kakuhen> what did macports mean by this >.<
[05:17:00] <kakuhen> install perl, post-install scripts trash your path, and then add a ton of random perl manpages and your usual manpages just disappear without warning...
[05:17:07] <gilberth> Thus my question ;)
[05:17:15] <kakuhen> well, that explains why man would only give me perl manpages for commands like "open"
[05:17:21] <kakuhen> that is really gross.
[05:18:29] <kakuhen> ok but this is still very mysterious
[05:18:31] <kakuhen> -r-xr-xr-x  5 root  admin  384112 Nov  1  2019 /opt/local/bin/man

[05:18:42] <kakuhen> I would've been accidentally using this man for the longest time  without issue...so what changed
[05:20:13] <kakuhen> AJA
[05:20:21] <kakuhen> there is a package called mandoc that placed these fileshere
[05:20:38] <kakuhen> sorry for spamming lispcafe with my stupidity this hour, but this is just the first time i've ever had a problem with manpages...
[05:20:48] *** Quits: selwyn (~selwyn@user/selwyn) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[05:23:28] <kakuhen> Wow, "port uninstall mandoc" is all I had to do to fix this problem. Well, at least now I know to avoid mandoc like the plague. No idea how I pulled it in.
[05:24:54] <gilberth> kakuhen: At least you were not off-topic. ;)
[05:27:51] <kakuhen> also if I used homebrew, determining mandoc did this would've been much harder.
[05:28:10] <kakuhen> homebrew just dumps binaries all over /usr/local without really tracking who provided what
[05:28:27] <kakuhen> and consequently brew(1) is not able to tell you the contents of a package, or even what package provided a given file in your prefix
[05:28:48] <kakuhen> macports doesn't have this problem; I was able to determine mandoc provided this because I ran "port provides /opt/local/bin/man"
[05:29:11] <kakuhen> this is partly why i consider macports to be much better than homebrew for maintenance, but wow whatever pulled in mandoc really makes me think less of macports' quality.

[05:41:30] <kakuhen> well, you have fink, pkgsrc, and nix as options
[05:42:11] <kakuhen> you probably won't like fink because it's based on APT and has very little maintenance
[05:42:33] <kakuhen> pkgsrc is nice if you enjoyed that while using NetBSD, but I am very partial towards FreeBSD / OpenBSD ports.
[05:42:44] <kakuhen> nix is the new one, but needs you to learn a very specialized language to use, and you'll be editing a text file to install packages...
[05:42:59] <kakuhen> also, since this is #lispcafe, i expect people to tell you to just use guix instead ;)
[05:43:24] <kakuhen> well, if you want a purely functional package manager, that is
[05:43:44] <kakuhen> Guix basically exists because the Nix people didn't want to use Scheme, they wanted a programming language that was purely functional, rather than restricting to a subset of Scheme.
[05:45:38] <hayley> Dear Nix, if Guix is declarative then why can't I run a constraint solver to find the optimal configuration for my Beowulf cluster
[05:46:45] <gilberth> Oh dear.
[05:47:43] <hayley> This meme was made by CLP(FD) gang 
[05:49:52] <gilberth> As I don't update neither my macOS nor my Linux, I am accustomed to build things right from the source distribution, which usually is rather pain-free. And since I can chose both the --prefix and the --program-suffix I can get it installed where I want. The program-suffix I used to have multiple versions available, for the most part gcc.
[05:51:27] <kakuhen> macports lets you choose prefix on installation
[05:51:42] <kakuhen> though it's better to default to /opt/local since otherwise binary archives will not target you
[05:51:48] <kakuhen> and that means you will be compiling everything yourself
[05:51:48] <gilberth> And since I used a different subdir in /opt for each version, I can easy downgrade again, if needed. I just have to switch my PATH.
[05:52:09] <kakuhen> also macports is able to support multiple versions of the same package, too
[05:52:36] <kakuhen> When you "upgrade" package on macports, what really happens is that your current copy is deactivated and they install + activate the latest release
[05:52:53] <kakuhen> So if an updated package gives you problems, you can simply reactivate the older release and delete the updated one
[05:53:07] <gilberth> Ah, that's nice.
[05:53:10] <kakuhen> or if you're feeling lucky and want to save space, then "port uninstall deactivated"
[05:53:21] <kakuhen> err sorry, inactive is the keyword.
[05:53:39] <kakuhen> this is what I did to try out Emacs 28.2
[05:53:43] <kakuhen> 28.0.50*
[05:53:48] <gilberth> Heh, since dave0 is around I have plenty of space.
[05:53:53] <notzmv> lol
[05:54:16] <kakuhen> I noticed that someone enabled native-comp by default, which made me happy. So I decided to try out emacs-app-devel on macports, but it conflicts with emacs-app (for good reason), so I deactivated my copy of emacs 27.2 and installed 28.0.50
[05:54:30] <kakuhen> Turns out I really hate the native comp warnings that appear every other second when you use most emacs packages.
[05:54:35] <kakuhen> So I just reverted back to 27.2
[05:54:41] <kakuhen> macports makes this process really transparent
[05:55:07] <kakuhen> and a little RTFM takes you quite a long way with it
[05:55:29] <kakuhen> unfortunately there is no feature to tell me my man got shadowed >.<
[05:56:05] <kakuhen> I was asking myself the wrong questions and applying the wrong answers for half an hour until gilberth asked me "are you using the correct man?"
[05:56:15] <gilberth> kakuhen: I installed the most recent version of Emacs one of my more recent macOS VM and found a bug within less a second. I like some inter-line space for better readability and this makes the cursor taller when placed at the end of a line. Very annoying. My ancient Emacs 24.5.1 doesn't have that bug.
[05:57:20] <gilberth> So much for updating. ;)
[05:57:22] <kakuhen> I can't say I experienced any annoying bugs on Emacs 27.2 so far
[05:57:31] <kakuhen> I first started using Emacs with 27.1, however.
[05:58:24] <kakuhen> basically I grew tired of overleaf, and eventually I got myself a macbook; on the first day of setting it up, I asked one of my emacs-obsessed friends to guide me through an emacs setup for typesetting math papers.
[05:58:51] <kakuhen> I didn't like it that much for the first 3 months, and I sometimes went back to using TeXShop, but Emacs grew on me (or I developed stockholm syndrome, or both)
[05:58:57] <kakuhen> Then I fell down the lisp rabbithole >.<
[05:59:05] <gilberth> kakuhen: Try (set-frame-parameter nil 'line-spacing 5) and see if the cursor keeps the same size at the end of a line.
[05:59:43] <kakuhen> ok I see the bug now; the end of line cursor is indeed larger
[05:59:50] <notzmv> the best rabbithole 0u0
[06:00:05] <kakuhen> I think it does that because of the space. I noticed the point varying in size  when I worked on my math homeworks
[06:00:20] <kakuhen> I like to preview latex within my buffer rather than constantly render whole PDFs
[06:00:35] <kakuhen> and the point can grow pretty large depending on where it is
[06:00:40] <gilberth> Yes, and that is just the wrong behaviour. xterm has the false logic.
[06:00:56] <gilberth> * the same false
[06:01:13] <kakuhen> maybe we can attempt patching this ;)
[06:01:19] <kakuhen> I'd need to learn how emacs draws the point first.
[06:01:33] <gilberth> kakuhen: Emacs 25 is fine.
[06:01:37] <kakuhen> oh also I need to figure out if GNUstep has this problem or else the maintainers will probably reject it.
[06:01:50] <gilberth> I miss my epoch patch to cope with variable width fonts.
[06:01:58] <kakuhen> it's pretty much impossible to change any mac-specific behavior since there's a strong policy against making emacs better on proprietary operating systems
[06:02:37] <kakuhen> that's also why the homebrew emacs package has a bunch of custom patches on it (with varying degrees of maintenance)
[06:02:51] <kakuhen> other package managers just pull straight from GNU or some binary archive that uses the actual GNU sources
[06:03:10] <kakuhen> and that's partly why emacs-app on homebrew is pretty unstable and a trainwreck compared to that of other package managers heh

[06:03:55] <gilberth> The Mac made me switch to GNU Emacs from epoch^WLucid Emacs^W^WXEmacs.
[06:04:10] <kakuhen> heh
[06:05:46] <gilberth> The Mac build of GNU Emacs is just better. I miss XEmacs still. But these days GNU Emacs also has syntax highlighting and can render to a display server.
[06:06:04] <kakuhen> also a lot more activity, it seems
[06:07:37] <gilberth> I'd really should find my epoch hack for variable width fonts. It would adjust width of spaces in indented lines to match with non-white space above. That way things look properly alignd with a variable width font. Like in <http://clim.rocks/gilbert/variable-width-hacking.pdf>
[06:08:24] <gilberth> kakuhen: Yes, XEmacs lost much steam. As GNU Emacs can talk X11 now, too, there isn't much of a reason for it anymore.

[10:01:36] <kakuhen> i kind of liked the approach apple once had with resource forks -- a dedicated metadata describing the type of file
[10:01:45] <kakuhen> unfortunately it was restricted to fixed set of 4 characters
[10:02:09] <kakuhen> so an RTF document would be " RTF" and a normal program had a special designator "AAPL" and a text file had "TEXT" and so on
[10:02:19] <kakuhen> seemed really tedious to change file types, however
[10:02:51] <kakuhen> (no, needing to have a copy of ResEdit around is not a good workaround)
[10:04:59] <gilberth> Yes, and full of surprises unless that file type in the resource fork is always displayed in a directory listing.
[10:05:58] <kakuhen> oh also I got the wrong type for RTF, it should be "RTF "

[10:09:15] <gilberth> Yes, and at times you come across the old MacOS pathname syntax.
[10:13:03] <hayley> Doesn't the macOS shell like to show you the damn colons? Same goes for AppleScript, where you have to say "the POSIX path "/dev/null"" or something.
[10:13:26] <kakuhen> i cant say i recall seeing colons pop up
[10:13:50] <kakuhen> but I have hit interesting corner cases with the CCL compiler where it would give me logical pathnames
[10:14:18] <kakuhen> e.g. I have ~/Developer/Lisp symlinked to ~/quicklisp/local-projects, and if I compile ~/Developer/Lisp/foo/bar.lisp and an error happens
[10:14:32] <kakuhen> then the error message will display something like home:quicklisp;local-projects;foo;bar.lisp
[10:15:01] <kakuhen> probably intended behavior since that's how pathnames work in common lisp, but that doesn't happen with other lisp impls on my machine (tested on ecl and sbcl)
[10:17:22] <gilberth> Hmm, home: is defined as a logical host. CMUCL has sth similar, though home: there is not a logical host. I have seen those actually be generated somehow from unix pathnames in CCL. Hmm.
[10:18:13] <kakuhen> when I first learnt about the logical pathname, I recall three being reserved by ccl
[10:18:21] <gilberth> * have never seen ; gilberth likes to drop a negation
[10:18:26] <kakuhen> sys (mandated by the cl spec, equivalent to ccl), ccl, and home
[10:18:59] <kakuhen> home will magically point to the current user's home directory
[10:19:25] <gilberth> Or does quicklisp user (user-homedir-pathname), but even that is a unix pathname for me.
[10:20:36] <kakuhen> (translate-logical-pathname "home:foo") ;=> #P”/Users/kakuhen/foo"
[10:20:58] <gilberth> The "home:" logical pathname is handy. But I have never seen it crop up by accident. I'd like to know how that happens. I'll experiment a little.
[10:20:59] <kakuhen> tried it with no init file
[10:21:28] <kakuhen> anyway yeah, when i mysteriously break a game im working on with a friend, the compiler will give me these semicolon paths

[10:31:49] <gilberth> kakuhen: As a source location?
[10:32:03] <kakuhen> will take too long for me to figure out how to make the debugger display the pathname like that
[10:32:24] <kakuhen> but it will just say it tried compiling the file "home:quicklisp;local-projects;foo;bar.lisp"
[10:32:35] <kakuhen> and that path also appears in the stack traced
[10:32:36] <kakuhen> trace*
[10:34:32] <gilberth> Indeed.
[10:35:41] <gilberth> I did (load(compile-file "~/foo/blah.lisp")) with "(defun blah ())" in it. And said (ccl:function-source-node #'blah) and it says "home:foo;blah.lisp"

[11:59:15] <pjb> moon-child: cat(1) is a good name.  tac(1) too (concatenates in reverse). and there's rev(1) too to reverse the characters, instead of the lines. ;-)
[12:00:32] * dave0 spots a unix weenie !
[12:00:42] <pjb> moon-child: remember: we've got 7 char/second terminals. I don't mean the keyboard or USB, I mean your fingers! And even with brain interfaces, people don't do more than 7 char/second!  We'll see at what speed neurlink let us type _programs_ in, but for a long time I won't bet for much more than that!
[12:01:09] <pjb> moon-child: notably check how vocal input for programming isn't that much faster either.
[12:01:19] <moon-child> oh yes, cat and cdr are both great names
[12:01:45] <dave0> if it's connected to by brain, should i program in pictures?
[12:01:50] <pjb> So, while it's a good idea to revise the assumptions from time to time, the unix choice of using short command and option names is a good one.
[12:01:50] <dave0> my*
[12:02:10] <moon-child> cdr is especially nice because of how it composes to make e.g. cadaddr.  In my j lisp interpreter, I called unbox 'c', which had a nice mnemonic consistency
[12:02:11] <pjb> As good is the choice of gnu of allowing longer-name options, with tab-completion! :-)
[12:02:31] <moon-child> pjb: there was an interesting study done which showed that while speakers of different languages spoke at very different speeds, the rate of information exchange was the same!
[12:02:49] <pjb> moon-child: car and cdr are nice because they don't mean anything. The pair is not left right, first rest, or any other kind of meaningful couple.  It's car/cdr and you can map it to any meaning you want.
[12:03:13] <moon-child> what are 6you talking about?  They mean address and decrement :)
[12:03:24] <pjb> moon-child: exactly.  And there's a theory that says that the link between the brain and the soul is no faster than about 16 bit/second.
[12:03:37] <dave0> i like posix'es solution to the having a filename called -r that you try to remove and it does rm -r
[12:03:50] <pjb> moon-child: of course, they meant address and decrement, but only on the 7090…
[12:03:56] <pjb> Since they, they've lost their meaning.
[12:03:58] <dave0> posix answer is to disallow filenames beginning with -
[12:04:13] <pjb> dave0: wrong. You can have them.  ./-foo is nice unix path.
[12:04:16] <pjb> posix.
[12:04:18] <moon-child> dave0: I think that may have been the first instance of a side channel vulnerability
[12:04:29] <moon-child> dave0: so does posix prevent you from saying touch ./- or touch -- -?
[12:04:38] <pjb> dave0: the only bytes you can't put in a posix file name are 0 and 47.
[12:05:01] <lotuseater> i thought that was coming from IBM704

[12:14:44] <hayley> PROGN returns the results of the nth form whereas PROG1 returns the first?
[12:14:44] <gilberth> N stands for N. Compare with PROG1 and PROG2
[12:15:38] <lotuseater> okay so as I thought, in a sense of "we go through N statements"
[12:16:20] <gilberth> It's the value of the nth statement. PROG1 and PROG2 also take more statements.
[12:16:48] <gilberth> No idea where the V comes from. But PROGV is a tactical nuke.

[12:18:03] <gilberth> I backup the medium slot of a sheet by a gensym and use PROGV to dynamically bind the symbol and thus in effect the sheet's medium.
[12:18:39] <gilberth> So the application and the event loop can mess with it at the same time.
[12:20:59] <gilberth> Both the application and the redisplay routines then have their own medium. In fact the medium the application sees is mute.

[12:26:42] <kakuhen> i dont like this "feature"
[12:27:11] <gilberth> And users could get very creative with their filenames. And they put accented characters in there too.
[12:27:56] <kakuhen> I like how your comment about filenames with spaces appeared just as I browsed a folder that violated as many of your preferences for filenames as possible heh
[12:28:14] <gilberth> Not so much an issue these days, as UTF-8 finally is getting used more and more. But it was a mess in former times with a few character sets to choose from.
[12:28:42] <kakuhen> oh yeah mojibake was a real problem back then
[12:28:58] <kakuhen> one website would use Big5 because they are behind the times and your browser is expecting shift jis or whatever
[12:29:02] <kakuhen> and you get pure garbage rendered

[12:29:39] <moon-child> basically no way to do that right and consistently.  (Though this may be more an argument against casefolding fnames than against unicode)
[12:30:02] <moon-child> (however I don't wish to cast stones in my glass house...)

[13:47:43] <selwyn95> lotuseater: yes, but it turned out that we could manufacture computer components well enough for it not to matter
[13:47:44] <kakuhen> well, "rounded corners" have been a thing for quite a while
[13:47:49] <selwyn95> no such luck with quantum computing
[13:47:58] <selwyn95> everything is really imprecise, and that is not likely to change
[13:48:06] <kakuhen> and if you go back to even Jobs-era stuff, say OS X Tiger, you will see Windows XP did what OS X did way before it was even sold to public.
[13:48:09] <selwyn95> however, we can error correct
[13:48:11] <kakuhen> top of window is rounded and bottom is sharp
[13:48:55] <lotuseater> selwyn95: right
[13:49:18] <selwyn95> however, nowadays they try to build better equipment specifically for quantum applications
[13:50:31] <selwyn95> apparently superconducting photon detectors are much better than they used to be for example
[13:50:39] <lotuseater> you mean like measuring equipment?
[13:50:46] <lotuseater> ahh
[13:50:56] <selwyn95> yes
[13:52:14] <lotuseater> right, so in general technology evolution there's also some kind of bootstrapping, first you build things to fit your needs as best as you can and with those you build better tooling for the same goals
[13:52:43] <selwyn95> well
[13:52:50] <lotuseater> well
[13:52:54] <selwyn95> lol
[13:53:31] <selwyn95> to use the laser as an example, quantum mechanics was invented 40 years before that
[13:53:48] <selwyn95> i have no idea how people managed to do experiments before the laser, but they did
[13:54:09] <selwyn95> there was no reason to expect a great technological advance in, say, 1935
[13:54:17] <lotuseater> right and it's important to have a good base to not just have things empirically
[13:54:28] <selwyn95> technological advances happen and then you can do exciting new experiments with them
[13:54:34] <lotuseater> yes it's very impressive!
[13:54:41] <selwyn95> yeah
[13:54:46] <selwyn95> gives me hope to be honest
[13:54:58] <lotuseater> or the Michelson-Morley experiment in a plane
[13:55:34] <selwyn95> physics sometimes seems stagnant, but i think the deadlock will not last forever for that reason
[13:56:18] <lotuseater> yes
[13:58:56] <lotuseater> and as we discussed earlier, it's more and more important and opens new insight when combining disciplines

[15:35:25] <pl> selwyn: why one wouldn't expect a great technological advance in 1935?
[15:35:47] <pl> it was a time when milestone-like changes hit various fields every year
[15:36:48] <pl> imagine going from big brick analog cell phone, to modern smartphone, in less than 10 years - every year a new major change coming from all around
[15:37:21] <selwyn> well, yes, but you cannot anticipate a particular change
[15:39:11] <pl> also arguable. A lot of changes were predictable, it was why you didn't have "this one place doing it and every one catching up"
[15:39:37] <selwyn> fair enough
[15:39:54] <selwyn> but i would say the laser was not like that
[15:40:57] <selwyn> afaik that kind of coherent light source just wouldn´t have been thinkable at the time
[15:41:12] <selwyn> different from incremental technological advances
[15:41:57] <pl> selwyn: foundational experiments that led to quantum mechanics started as early as 1801 (double-slit)
[15:42:40] <selwyn> yes
[15:43:48] <pl> selwyn: and we had reasonably coherent sources as far back as 1927, when double-split pointed to wave nature of electrons... except we also had a ton of data they are particles
[15:46:39] <ck_> mmm, double-split

[16:13:16] <selwyn> my point is that this whole modern thing of being able to isolate small numbers of ions/atoms/photons and do things like entangle them probably wasn´t anticipated back then

[16:16:57] <selwyn> hard to believe that they invented ion traps before lasers, but there we are

[16:26:18] <selwyn> you can maybe slow down magnetic monopoles using stark deceleration and trap them in a magnetic trap
[16:26:55] <selwyn> happily the fact that they have a magnetic field makes it fairly straightforward to interact with them

[17:19:42] <gilberth> Get hospitalized for weeks with needles everyday, it then goes away. ;) No, seriously, I was pretty afraid of needles, too. I would usually seek a chat to distract me. For taking a blood sample at the doctor, I'd ask my wife to come with.
[17:22:26] <gilberth> In the hospital I told the nurse about by needle-phobia and asked them to chat while they would do their business. And of course: Don't look at the needle. For a non-intravenous needles, you usually don't take notice at all, when distracted. And: A lot of people have trouble with needles.
[17:23:13] <hayley> To some extent I wonder how the hell they fit the damn needle in my skinny arms too.
[17:23:33] <selwyn> they don´t really let you see the needle

[18:26:34] <gilberth> Hmm, your AUD 6449.00 would be EUR 3.982, but I find the CPU for EUR 4.224 incl 19% VAT
[18:27:07] <hayley> GST is 10%, so it could be excluding. But that would be weird.
[18:27:51] <hayley> Always wanted a RAID, but I don't really want to get the drives and ports for it. Though the SSD I got on sale is fast enough most of the time.
[18:29:16] <gilberth> Hmm: (values (/ 3982 1.10) (/ 4224 1.19)) => 3620.0; 3549.5796
[18:29:27] <hayley> And it wouldn't be an order of magnitude like HDD to SSD sadly. Then I would need CLOSOS and an expensive SSD.
[18:30:34] <hayley> And furthermore I have / on SSD and /home on HDD, with some crap symlinked from the latter to the former (mostly games from memory). So I should also pick what to manually "cache" better.

[18:34:08] * hayley uses the log as a file system.
[18:35:14] <hayley> Ditto for paper organisation.
[18:35:39] <gilberth> I still consider this as a marketing problem. Like with CLIM. People don't realize that CLIM could also be used like a traditional toolkit without all the arcane presentation based stuff. Or like Lisp, where people believe it would be a functional programming language for AI.
[18:36:33] <pjb> oh no!  Stack Overflow Is Down <https://stackoverflow.com/>  millions of programmers cannot work anymore!
[18:37:46] <gilberth> Heh. This will cost the industry billions!
[18:38:05] <hayley> But then CLIM wouldn't present anything interesting. It's all command loops.
[18:38:42] <hayley> So how would you get programmers to accept it over anything else really?
[18:39:35] <hayley> You are right about Lisp advertising, but trying to frame CLIM the same way, where the command loop is useful, is a real pane.
[18:39:55] <gilberth> hayley: I want the Silica part established as a de facto standard. See cl-pdf for example, why isn't it just a CLIM backend, with the CLIM API? A pity.
[18:41:51] <gilberth> You can't do that, when you always praise the command loop, which nobody wants and drives people away. Most want a few native gadgets. Also: When the application is thought to be used by users and not Lisp hackers, you can't use an interactor --- too alien.
[18:43:02] <gilberth> So people come up with all sorts of ad hoc bindings to existing C toolkits.

[19:10:24] <selwyn> *if they could hire
[19:10:34] <selwyn> to solve the labour shortages
[19:11:27] <shka> funny
[19:11:35] <selwyn> a big part of this crisis is caused by the fact that lots of companies simply don´t want to pay their workers more
[19:11:53] <selwyn> which makes me feel that the labour market is not really a market at all
[19:12:11] <shka> not so simple 
[19:12:19] <gilberth> contrapunctus: Have you seen the Lispworks CLIM User Guide?
[19:12:21] <ck_> the images of placeholders in otherwise-empty supermarket shelves look vaguely soviet
[19:12:31] <selwyn> well
[19:12:39] <shka> for instance, if mcdonald would become more expensive, more people would decide that indeed they have food at home
[19:12:40] <ck_> (sad sainsbury's noises)
[19:12:42] <contrapunctus> gilberth: I had a look at it earlier...I'll take a look again 🤔
[19:13:07] <selwyn> it seems that they are prioritising london over remote areas in the supply chain so i have noticed a few shortages but nothing that big
[19:13:17] <selwyn> perhaps gnuxie has seen some
[19:13:27] <ck_> where's gnuxie at?
[19:14:11] <Gnuxie> up north 
[19:14:22] <ck_> lake or loch?
[19:14:22] <Gnuxie> I've not seen placeholders lol
[19:14:25] <Gnuxie> or I don't think i've seen them 
[19:14:29] <Gnuxie> maybe they work

[19:15:15] <Gnuxie> lake, I'm not scottish or i'd have just said that 
[19:16:01] <selwyn> stupid country
[19:16:10] <Gnuxie> the virgin lake dweller anglo vs the chad loch loving celt 
[19:16:11] <ck_> I don't know about that kind of signaling, sorry
[19:16:12] <selwyn> it will at least be funny if they do try to get the army to do the supply chain
[19:16:52] <ck_> oh, bad idea I think, don't do it
[19:17:07] <Gnuxie> doubt the army could there's no enough army 
[19:17:14] <Gnuxie> 80k army vs 100k missing lorry drivers
[19:17:27] <ck_> I saw a man calling from Afghanistan to Sky news, wanting to complain to Boris Johnson because he was "absolutely appalled" at the state of things
[19:17:32] <Gnuxie> and not everyone in the army is a truck driver ofc 
[19:17:37] <ck_> well, heard rather than saw raterh 
[19:17:51] <selwyn> they probably can´t drive articulated lorries either
[19:18:31] <Gnuxie> Boris probably doesn't know that though, so it's still possible i guess 
[19:19:28] <ck_> well, my thoughts and prayers are with you in these difficult times
[19:20:12] <selwyn> it´s not that bad
[19:20:14] <ck_> not all is well here either, though. The printers I wanted to make me a nice clqr has gone
[19:20:36] <selwyn> but tbh covid is the only thing that made me think that leaving the country is a really good idea
[19:20:44] <Gnuxie> are the lorry drivers still going on strike next week ? 
[19:20:46] <ck_> where would you go?
[19:20:49] <selwyn> idk
[19:20:54] <selwyn> and idk
[19:21:10] <Gnuxie> i thought lorry drivers were historically scabby though, so idk if that will play out 
[19:21:26] <shka> they may have more leverage now
[19:21:33] <selwyn> ah yes: on saturday every pub i went to was essentially out of beer on tap
[19:21:37] <shka> for obvious reasons
[19:21:38] <selwyn> which is really crazy
[19:21:41] <ck_> keyboardco.com now has "Brexit Special" sales. weird times
[19:22:23] <shka> i don't understand why going with that brexit thing while covid is going on
[19:22:46] <Gnuxie> finally some world beating deals

[19:24:54] <ck_> heh
[19:26:29] <shka> i bought my keyboard at https://falba.tech/
[19:26:29] -ixelp- You are being redirected...
[19:26:38] <shka> custom made
[19:27:51] <edgar-rft> now you have your own characters that nobody uses but you?
[19:28:32] <shka> uhm?
[19:28:36] <shka> why would i want that?
[19:28:56] <ck_> "how can you call your keyboard custom if you have all the same keys as everyone else?"
[19:29:17] <edgar-rft> shka: don't know, just custom made characters
[19:30:12] <edgar-rft> can they make me a keyboard from crispbread?
[19:30:55] <selwyn> prince andrew sigh
[19:32:09] <edgar-rft> no, I'm prince edgar
[19:32:35] <edgar-rft> my father is king kong
[19:32:57] <selwyn> i don´t know what will happen, but i think the media is gearing up for a shameless reputation laundering
[19:33:01] <selwyn> not sure if it will work
[19:35:07] <pjb> edgar-rft: so you've got a lot of body hair?
[19:40:28] <contrapunctus> gilberth: «I wish, I could write.» the good news is that both tutorials and how-to guides essentially consist of sequences of concrete steps - no need to be verbose :)
[19:43:25] <contrapunctus> I'd love to know how to display a cursor in an application frame...there's the `:initial-cursor-visibility`, but I can't figure out how to use that in `(:panes ...)`, if it is at all supposed to go there.
[19:44:47] <ck_> contrapunctus: isn't there a demo that does that?
[19:47:42] <contrapunctus> ck_: `(setf (cursor-visibility (stream-text-cursor *standard-input*)) t)` this?
[19:51:30] <ck_> I meant "showing a cursor in an application frame", but it wasn't rhetorical, I don't know.  In general, the demo set is a good place to look though

[22:32:37] <contrapunctus> It needs tutorials and how-tos. The specification is like a reference + explanation. The McCLIM manual is mostly a reference + explanation, with some tutorials.
[22:34:28] <contrapunctus> (Tutorials and how-tos are both sequences of steps; tutorials are aimed at learners, and learning by doing; how-tos are recipes for specific tasks, aimed at somewhat familiar users; both of them avoid explaining as far as possible.)
