[00:09:21] <dmc> o.O
[00:19:03] <gwozniak> Yeah, that response is a whole lot of nothing
[00:19:10] <jjuran> Saved me a click
[00:56:45] <cb> i'm not going to speculate until i learn some hard facts
[00:56:58] <cb> or at least from anyone involved
[00:59:23] <gwozniak> Yup. Waiting for substantial info before making any judgement
[00:59:37] <edk> i'm just not expecting to make any judgment
[01:01:12] <gwozniak> I fully expect I'll be in judgement limbo for a long time since I doubt I'll hear anything useful for a while
[01:01:42] <edk> like i'm sure rust's governance is fucked up in several interesting ways because everything's governance is fucked up
[01:01:45] <gwozniak> But I am prepared for the rumours
[01:02:17] <edk> but i don't think it's very important to have an opinion about exactly how fucked up it is and whose fault that is
[01:06:21] <gwozniak> ``As a proud alumna, by giving to Western I champion the students who come after me.''  <-- My initial reading of this was that it implied I was chasing this person for some reason
[01:11:32] <imode> get 'em, gwozniak.
[01:14:02] <pja> I am very out of the loop - what happened to Rust people?
[01:18:44] <imode> whole mod team resigned.
[01:19:32] <pja> Did they say why?
[01:19:46] <pja> I presume they had reasons.
[01:42:24] <Brekkjern> Christ, Arcane is amazing
[01:42:33] <Brekkjern> The animation quality is just beyond
[01:57:00] <gerikson> GH is back apparently
[01:57:06] <gerikson> Brekkjern: what is it?
[01:57:13] <Brekkjern> gerikson: Netflix series
[01:57:19] <Brekkjern> Based on League of Legends
[01:57:22] <Brekkjern> Surprisingly good
[01:57:54] <Brekkjern> The animation work is seriously some of the best I have ever seen
[01:57:58] <Brekkjern> In any context really
[02:11:36] <Brekkjern> Also, I thought Foundation was pretty good. The best part being Empire of course.
[02:14:46] <edk> i thought foundation had good visuals and generally good acting but the story wasn't really... there
[02:15:01] <edk> the characters seemed pretty weak too
[02:15:29] <gerikson> Brekkjern: novels or show?
[02:16:01] <Brekkjern> gerikson: Show
[02:16:21] <Brekkjern> edk: I agree, with the exception of the Empire storyline
[02:16:28] <Brekkjern> It carried the entire show
[02:16:47] <edk> the empire actors carried that storyline though imo
[02:17:02] <Brekkjern> I don't entirely disagree
[02:29:08] <Brekkjern> I also just started on Wheel of Time. Not entirely convinced after 3 episodes to be honest
[02:29:16] <Brekkjern> It's not terrible, but it's not great either

[21:49:12] <cb> my server, desktop, and laptop

[21:49:17] <gwozniak> same
[21:49:19] <cb> what the fuck are these people even doing
[21:49:36] <cb> i don't build large projects too often but i build them fine
[21:49:43] <prussian> mine has 32GiB because I use to run VMs for everything.
[21:49:44] <gwozniak> i kind of run out on my work machine, but it's not serious
[21:49:59] <Brekkjern> I have 32GB to run Chrome
[21:50:07] <prussian> and one vm needs 20GiB only because 30+ copies of gcc compiling c++ seem to use all the rams.
[21:50:49] <gwozniak> I run a Windows and Linux VM at work, mostly Linux. I can't run both at the same time nicely
[21:50:56] <prussian> damn, this guy has 64GiB of ram in his stinkpad.
[21:50:58] <prussian> real hero
[21:51:26] <bkero> You'd be hard pressed to make gcc use more RAM than Slack.
[21:51:40] <gwozniak> It takes linking large C++ to do it
[21:51:54] <gwozniak> In debug mode, usually
[21:52:28] <cb> i dont know how much the build/dev box at work has
[21:52:31] <prussian> well, there is one project, where the linked shared object, unstripped is like 3.2GiB
[21:52:34] <prussian> I wish I was joking.
[21:52:47] <prussian> and that's just one of like 10 libraries involved.
[21:52:52] <bkero> I used to do daily chromium debug builds. The amount of time it would consume 10G+ of resident would be very small.
[21:53:00] <gwozniak> GCC itself, built with -g3, is pretty big
[21:53:06] <prussian> damn...
[21:53:16] <prussian> I didn't even knoww debug took a number.
[21:53:32] <gwozniak> Better macro support at higher levels
[21:53:33] <cb> i rebuild php like thrice over for patches every moonth
[21:53:39] <prussian> all this time...
[21:53:43] <prussian> til i guess.
[21:53:49] <cb> that's like 40 minutes on i think four or eight threads of a POWER9
[21:53:54] <cb> i think 8 GB of RAM
[21:54:16] <prussian> crazy.
[21:54:20] <prussian> whack, even
[21:54:24] <gwozniak> I've crashed a box linking Clang/LLVM in debug mode
[21:55:08] <gwozniak> Then I realized it wasn't using the Gold linker (ld.bfd is a piece of shit)
[21:55:47] <prussian> that's a good point. I keep forgetting gold is a think

[22:02:06] <prussian> I feel sorry for windows users.
[22:07:55] <gwozniak> I have compiled something on Windows so few times I don't even remember what it's like
[22:08:12] <gwozniak> It was, at best, tiny programs
[22:21:24] <prussian> ya, I don't get how people use windows.

[23:27:55] <gwozniak> I get a very "being at one with the computer" vibe from those who defend or champion that approach to programming as superior
[23:29:20] <imode> it's a very real feeling.
[23:30:14] <gwozniak> And here's where the heretical part comes in: I am beginning to wonder if that kind "programming utopia" is an unhinged as the libertarian fantasy of pure self-determination
[23:30:51] <gerikson> whoah
[23:31:35] <imode> I think that there's an overlap but not a strict overlap.
[23:32:24] <gwozniak> For sure. But as I mentally explore it more, it seems to fit with what I've seen for a while

[23:34:21] <imode> the notion that you can mesh with your tools to the point where they're an extension of your thoughts is a valid one and is borderline programmer nirvana.
