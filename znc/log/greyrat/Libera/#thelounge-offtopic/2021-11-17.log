[09:08:09] * bookworm leaves the project
[09:26:02] <CSC346> I just got all the scripts working together.  Now I just need to write the server metadata api :)
[09:26:57] <CSC346> this is the spec btw:

[09:33:51] <bookworm> hating on JS nice teacher... why do they care?
[09:33:58] <bookworm> as long as it works?
[09:34:10] <bookworm> can use brainfuck for all they care
[09:34:24] <bookworm> (although then code review might be interesting)
[09:58:31] <CSC346> I'm not sure.  I think it has to do with TAs not understanding
[09:59:47] <CSC346> I double checked about running a JS app like TL he said all he cared about was the management side
[10:00:32] <CSC346> I think he was just happy that I didn't just deploy coppies of the project 6 web site like everone else

[11:26:02] <CSC346> the class has been a funny combination of python and bash scripting
[11:26:45] <CSC346> I swear to god I had to write a bash command to update a sql server for this project
[11:28:32] <CSC346> mysql -u $(username) -p$(password) -D $(dbid) -h $(host) -e "UPDATE servers SET ready = 1 WHERE ec2id = '${2}';"
[11:34:11] <johncs> aw that kinda sucks honestly
[11:34:18] <johncs> i don't feel like teachers should be language bashing
[11:48:12] <CSC346> I almost wrote something in C out of spite but getting the libraries to work would have taken too long..

[13:34:45] <CSC346> or is it REST?
[13:39:01] <bookworm> REST* rust is the new language everything should be written in as it solves all problems and then some ;P
[13:42:11] <CSC346> will it give me a CS education that's worth a shit? --;
