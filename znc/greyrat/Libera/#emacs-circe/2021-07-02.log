[17:07:38] <ngz> Hmmmm. I think `enable-circe-color-nicks' has some issue.
[17:09:07] <ngz> I often see nicks with the same color.
[17:09:44] <wasamasa> I mean, if the nicks are randomly picked from a limited pool...
[17:09:52] <wasamasa> s/nicks/nick colors/
[17:11:26] <ngz> Yes, I understand that. But it appears often enough that I subsume something wrong.
[17:12:22] <ngz> Or the pool is _really_ limited.
[17:12:30] <wasamasa> 16 colors tops
[17:12:59] <ngz> Doesn't it depend on circe-color-nicks-min-contrast-ratio ?
[17:13:21] <wasamasa> it depends on several things
[17:13:35] <wasamasa> I've done some customizations and that limits it to 8
[17:13:58] <ngz> 8 is very small.
[17:14:52] <ngz> I wonder if it could be useful to drop the color associated to a nick as soon as it becomes inactive. (per `circe-active-users-timeout').
[17:15:15] <ngz> It would become "conversation color" instead of "nick color".
[17:18:23] <wasamasa> there's an open PR for hashed nick colors
[17:18:30] <wasamasa> consider looking at it as well
[17:19:05] <ngz> Oh, that a fairly recent PR (18 hours agos)
[17:19:06] <ngz> ago*
[17:19:14] <wasamasa> I have a few ideas
[17:19:33] <wasamasa> like, not using MD5, not truncating its output and using a separate pool that's never depleted
[17:19:37] <ngz> It wouldn't solve the current issue, tho.
[17:19:47] <wasamasa> no, but it gives people an alternative behavior
[17:19:55] <wasamasa> where the same nicks get the same color
[17:22:01] <ngz> Well, I may be misunderstanding it, but I fail to see a use case. 
[17:22:12] <wasamasa> that's how it works in way more popular IRC clients
[17:22:45] <ngz> mIRC!
[17:22:58] <wasamasa> like irssi/weechat
[17:23:36] <ngz> You still can get two different nicks with the same color, can't you?
[17:23:40] <wasamasa> of course
[17:23:49] <wasamasa> collisions are inevitabl
[17:23:50] <wasamasa> e
[17:24:49] <wasamasa> it avoids that pool depletion problem and has predictable colors persisting over IRC sessions
[17:25:56] <ngz> I think the eye can distinguish 10M differet colors. I'm sure we can avoid collisions ;)
[17:26:03] <ngz> different*
[17:26:08] <wasamasa> at some point the colors will look sameish
[17:26:45] <ngz> True.
[17:27:16] <ngz> Hmmm, I still think there's something to do with `circe-active-users-timeout'.
[17:30:25] <ngz> I.e., two nicks can have the same color, but we make it very unlikely that two nicks active at the same time get the same color.
[17:35:23] <ngz> Actually, that's close to what `circe-nick-color-pick-least-recent' does.
[17:35:37] <wasamasa> yup
[17:36:40] <ngz> The flaw is that a nick that's been active (i.e., visible in the chat) a long time get its color copied. So new nicks are more likely to get its color.
[17:55:19] <ngz> What is the minimum Emacs version expected from Circe?
[17:55:42] <wasamasa> 24.4, officially
[17:55:47] <ngz> OK.
