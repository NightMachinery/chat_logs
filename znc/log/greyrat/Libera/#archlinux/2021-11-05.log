[15:20:03] <theh> It seems that Libvirt is a universal recommnedation, since QEMU doesn't keep track of any configuration. Libvirt seems kind of complex to set up though, or is that just the Arch Wiki covering all edge cases? I worry this will mess with my host OS.

[15:33:53] <theh> Is the Libvirt "user/system-session" distinction about configuration of machines or about running them? I.e. is "user-session" interesting for users without su privileges, whereas "system-session" may imply launching the daemon as root but dropping most privileges thereafter for execution?
[15:34:19] <sensille> crazy. thanks all :)

[23:52:12] <arseru> Hi! I'm back with my weird `nemo` timeout issue; every time I turn on my computer and launch `nemo`, it takes 25-30 seconds to really open, giving me a timeout error. The 2nd and further times I launch it everything works fine, until I reboot. Here you can find some debug information https://bpa.st/VSCQ last time some folks helped me get to the point to know it was a generic gtk issue, but up until now I couldn't figure out how to solve it. Any 
[23:52:12] <arseru> ideas? :)

[23:52:54] <NetSysFire> check your journal
[23:53:09] <arseru> Also, `nemo` is the only file manager I have installed, I had thunar and pcmanfm but I removed them before doing this
[23:54:00] <NetSysFire> when did this start happening?
