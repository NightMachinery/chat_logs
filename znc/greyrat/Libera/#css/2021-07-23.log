[12:10:42] <AMcBain> FunkyBob, I can't remember exactly why but when I wrote a project using SVGs for icons I had the title tag, but also added an aria-labelledby attribute on the <svg> set to the ID I also gave the <title> tag inside the <svg>.
[12:10:51] <AMcBain> There was probably some reason for that.
[12:11:16] <AMcBain> It might also be one of those "that's overkill" things.
[12:12:51] <AMcBain> Ah, looks like there was previously inconsistent support for recognizing the <title> tag, but that may not be true anymore.
[12:13:02] <AMcBain> So that fixed it for more things.
[12:14:04] * AMcBain should probably install something like Jaws or whatever is current and see what it does.
[12:18:52] <AMcBain> Weeeeelll so Firefox has that accessibility tab in their inspector but it turns out the app I put that in made the title/aria-labelledby stuff conditional based on sending in "alt" text to the template that generated it... and nobody wrote any. :|
[12:19:02] <AMcBain> So I can't see what happens.

[16:31:32] <entuland> you can put more than simple text but it still is quite limited in what you can put there: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content
[16:32:46] <lara9942> i just have to wrap, is multi browser support good?
[16:33:54] <entuland> you can have it wrap automatically if you just restrain the width, the compatibility is at the end of that page I linked
[16:34:34] <entuland> depending on what you plan on putting there it may not belong there at all
[16:34:58] <entuland> it's not supposed to convey actual content that should belong to the markup instead
[16:36:22] <lara9942> ok, eventually I could use an image?
[16:36:43] <entuland> yes, the page I linked above includes instructions about how to put images there
[16:37:20] <entuland> not that you really need the content attribute for that, as you could put the image in the background of such a pseudo element
[16:38:29] <lara9942> ok thanks

[17:35:33] <entuland> is the form itself tabular data?
[17:36:37] <entuland> as in, the data the user is supposed to enter in the fields is actual tabular data?
[17:36:56] <entuland> or you're using the table only to arrange your fields in a grid?
[17:41:39] <entuland> Minall ^
[17:42:14] <Minall> entuland I'm using the table only to arrange fields in a grid
[17:42:22] <Minall> Thanks for pinging me, I'm in the matter rightn ow
[17:43:38] <entuland> then you shouldn't be using a table at all
[17:43:43] <entuland> use a grid layout instead
[17:44:23] <entuland> put your elements in the markup the way the make more sense for their logical structure, and only tackle the presentation via the grid layout in CSS
[17:44:57] <Minall> Ok entuland, I'm on it!
[17:45:11] <entuland> that will also help you cover for narrow spaces on mobile where you can't have, say, more than 2 columns or 1 column at most
[17:53:12] <Minall> Thanks entuland, I'm finding it amazing now that I'm using Bootstrap grid system
[17:53:37] <entuland> uhm... I don't think boostrap uses the grid layout, as in the true CSS grid layout
[17:53:48] <entuland> they name it grid but they use floats or something, IIRC
[17:54:31] <entuland> inspect the end result and verify what the outcome really is
[17:55:02] <entuland> not that you _have to_ worry about that - it's just to be aware of what you're getting with that grid system
[17:55:09] <entuland> so that you are ready in case you have to tweak it
[17:55:28] <entuland> (or so that you can decide not to use it at all)

[17:56:40] <Minall> From here apparently, very simple: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/, makes me think why a table was used at first... Now my layout is fixed, thank you entuland
[17:57:11] <entuland> ah yes, they use flex but name it grid
[17:57:12] <entuland> yw
[17:57:20] <entuland> just be aware that you're really using flex there
[17:58:16] <Minall> I'm now aware since you told, me, quite simple too!
[17:58:37] <entuland> the "cons" there is that it forces you to "hardcode" the rows / cols in the markup
[17:58:54] <entuland> the true CSS grid layout doesn't need any "helper" markup

[18:03:15] <Minall> Wow that's beautiful entuland... If I have the change here at work to be more frontend, I would love to, to learn more about CSS and UI
[18:03:57] <entuland> this is pretty much a mandatory reference to keep in mind: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web
[18:04:51] <entuland> if you are in the context of bootstrap and other frameworks it may or may not be a good idea to "swim against the flow" and do your own thing directly instead of using the framework facilities (cause other devs messing with the same stuff would expect those facilities to be used)
[18:05:31] <entuland> but yes, you can do all of such things without any framework, often in a simpler and leaner way
[18:06:12] <Minall> Thanks entuland, how many years do you have in this field?, and yes, I would do things first and THEN go to a framework like, tailwinds since, it seems pretty loved
[18:07:12] <entuland> I've been a programmer for 25+ years now, web dev since 15+ years (kinda "retired" from web dev, I do game support now)

[18:13:27] <entuland> make sure you check the basics in that link to know what the current features around are and pay attention to the age of anything you may find googling
[18:14:17] <entuland> it's actually faster to learn the modern approaches ignoring the nightmares "we" had to deal with in the past
[18:15:25] <entuland> table layouts, float layouts and the alike, along with browser quirks and inconsistencies when we barely had firebug or had no firebug at all
[18:17:10] <Minall> Thanks entuland, you saw the frontend world changing and all and that's amazing, but Imma start with the basics on that link you gave me
