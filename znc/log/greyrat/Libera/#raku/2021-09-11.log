[00:58:39] <sjn> I've taken the liberty to create a #rakulang channel on the TPF slack, for those of us who care to interact with YAS/TPF/TRF :-) https://join.slack.com/share/zt-vjwsz56u-LI~JrIpXhVkT4vUz6mqX5g
[00:59:29] <sjn> (link valid for another two weeks, from now)
[01:09:59] <unixcat64> what is the plural for members of the Raku community? like Rust has "rustaceans", Go has "gophers"
[01:11:50] <Altai-man> unixcat64, rakoons maybe.
[01:12:13] <unixcat64> hmm

[01:23:51] <unixcat64> it would have to be something related to Camelia
[01:29:18] <moritz_> it used to be lambdacamels
[01:29:51] <moritz_> back when Audrey was bringing in all the Haskell programmers
[01:45:52] <moon-child> I prefer 'camel curry'
[01:48:23] <japhb> You can always tell when new Haskell programmers join the channel, because they ask questions I hadn't even found a need for yet.  :-)

[02:15:21] <tbrowder> hi, zef question, please: if i remove the .zef directory, will i have to reinstall all the modules? (i know early on i was told to remove .zef to help some zef problem, but i don't remember the result.)
[02:16:20] <ugexe> no
[02:16:34] <ugexe> `zef nuke site` is generally how you delete all your installed modules
[02:17:01] <ugexe> you should pretty much never be afraid to delete ~/.zef at any time for any reason
