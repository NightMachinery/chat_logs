[17:59:29] <lizzin> I want `pod` to point to the right version. `pod --version` shows '1.9.3'. but I did a `sudo gem install cocoapods` and it said it installed version '1.11.2' successfully

[18:06:46] <adam12> lizzin: Shot in the dark, but what does `/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin/ruby -S pod --version` show
[18:06:50] <adam12> I don't remember if -S will work here.
[18:07:38] <lizzin>  1.11.2
[18:08:03] <adam12> It sounds like a path problem.
[18:09:07] <adam12> inside `gem environment`, there's `EXECUTABLE DIRECTORY`. If that's not in your `$PATH` or if it's in your path but after `/usr/local/bin`, you're probablly running into this issue.
[18:09:12] <adam12> How did you install Ruby?
[18:09:31] <adam12> This is OSX?
[18:09:36] <lizzin> I think I used brew to install ruby.
[18:09:48] <lizzin> Yes, OSX. So I was trying to update from the system version
[18:10:37] <adam12> It's a challenge because both OSX and Brew use Ruby. OSX is not going to ship it in the future (they are pruning a lot of dev tools) and Brew has been shipping it's own.
[18:10:51] <adam12> So I say it's challenging because, which ruby is receiving your `gem install` and which path is it using?
[18:11:18] <lizzin> the `EXECUTABLE DIRECTORY` is not in my path.
[18:11:25] <adam12> If you want it a bit easier to rationalize about, my suggestion is to install a ruby version manager, and then install a Ruby through that. And not use `sudo` for `gem install`, ever.
[18:12:10] <lizzin> think I should just uninstall ruby via brew and start over with a ruby version manager?
[18:12:54] <adam12> lizzin: Yes.
[18:13:03] <lizzin> ok
[18:13:04] <adam12> lizzin: I've been using `frum` and it works reasonably well. Install through Brew.
[18:13:47] <lizzin> ok, ill give that a try
[18:14:19] <adam12> lizzin: It's basically `brew install fum`, then update your profile script to add `frum init`, re-open terminal, `frum install`, and then `gem install cocoapods`.
[18:14:35] <adam12> lizzin: If that still gives you the wrong version, `sudo uninstall cocoapods` to remove the system version which might have higher precedence.
[18:23:35] <lizzin> ok, I'm going to give this a try

[22:50:30] <newton> I thought doing something like system('command -v chruby') might work but in IRB it doesn't. the shell also has $CHRUBY_VERSION but doesn't show up in env
[22:50:59] <weaksauce> are you enabling chruby in the right startup file? 
[22:51:41] <newton> yeah chruby setup is all good
[22:56:57] <weaksauce> what's the problem you are actually trying to solve by knowing that? 
[22:58:03] <newton> I simply want a ruby script to be able to detect if chruby is active in the context the script is run in
[22:59:21] <newton> http://ix.io/3ByS -- maybe system isn't the right direction?
[23:01:30] <adam12> `command` might work, but it might need an interactive shell. system(ENV["SHELL"], "-i", "-c", "command", "-v", "chruby") or something
[23:01:43] <adam12> Interactive shell caveats asside.
[23:02:19] <adam12> or rather, "command -v chruby" being the last argument past "-c"
[23:05:11] <adam12> Could even try leaving `-i` off. That's going to be dependent on how you load chruby, because some init scripts (Ubuntu?) default to exiting early if non-interactive.
