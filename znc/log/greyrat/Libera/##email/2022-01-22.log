[15:35:19] <tuxick> Khepra: ah yes, bad dns gets blocked instead of scored
[15:35:37] <tuxick> so this 10% is just 10% less work for the filter :)
[16:05:26] <colo> so, regarding my "longish" DKIM TXT record problem from yesterday: entering the RR's value into the form in a very specific way that support informed be of fixed my problem
[16:06:50] <colo> and if anyone else ever wondered what opendkim's "opendkim-testkey: key not secure" warning was supposed to mean: acording to the source code I just looked at, that's what happens when the DKIM pubkey data retrieved from DNS is not signed via DNSSEC. TIL.
[16:07:08] <colo> (not a very useful or accurate warning message, if you ask me)
[16:15:12] <tuxick> yeah, adding dkim records is a secret art
[16:18:47] <colo> I find it quite OK if I have full control over my zone file (or DNS backend database) :)
[16:22:24] <tuxick> yes
[16:22:39] <tuxick> but many of our customers are using some oddball web ui
[16:22:58] <tuxick> so i'm often surprised they manage to add dkim records
[16:23:13] <tuxick> i just send the output from opendkim
[16:23:57] <colo> do you rotate keys regularly?
[16:24:35] <tuxick> pff why
[16:24:43] <tuxick> ever seen a reason to?
[16:24:50] *** Joins: CaCode (~CaCode@user/cacode)
[16:25:16] <colo> I just rotated for the first time in 10 years ;) in my case, it was to upgrade to a longer key. hence my problem.
[16:25:17] <tuxick> it's make sense if you run large site i suppose

[20:40:53] <wyre> hi guys, I'm curious, what do I need to use my domain as email agent? 
[20:41:17] <wyre> I mean ... apparently I need my domain provider provides me some MTA, right? 
[20:41:30] <lunaphyte> what does "use my domain as email agent" actually mean?
[20:41:46] <wyre> lunaphyte, to send emails as whoever@mydomain.dom
[20:41:58] <lunaphyte> oh
[20:42:02] <lunaphyte> you need an email service provider
[20:42:12] <wyre> and could I set a custom one on my host? 
[20:42:23] <lunaphyte> i'm not sure what that means
[20:42:31] <lunaphyte> "set a custom one on my host"
[20:42:34] <wyre> My host provider is not the same than my domain provider
[20:42:45] <lunaphyte> what is a "host provider"?
[20:43:11] <wyre> lunaphyte, where my server is actually, I've rented a virtual server to a host provider
[20:43:22] <wyre> they aren't the same than my domain provider 
[20:43:26] <lunaphyte> oh, your vps provider?
[20:43:35] <wyre> exactly
[20:43:53] <lunaphyte> are you planning to be your own email service provider?
[20:44:05] <wyre> something like this
[20:44:10] <lunaphyte> or are you planning to find an existing email service provider, and use them?
[20:44:11] <wyre> I'm not actually planning it
[20:44:18] <wyre> just curious if is possible
[20:44:28] <lunaphyte> it is certainly possible, of course
[20:44:32] <lunaphyte> why wouldn't it be?
[20:44:38] <wyre> both could be valid, I would like to know also what's your suggestion
[20:45:04] <wyre> lunaphyte, I think there are some kind of difficulties like spam filters or domain blacklist, aren't they? 
[20:45:09] <lunaphyte> my suggestion depends on your reasons for wanting to send emails as whoever@mydomain.dom
[20:45:13] <wyre> s/they/there/
[20:45:25] <lunaphyte> e.g. why do you want to do this?
[20:45:55] <wyre> lunaphyte, for a contact form as confirmation emails for registrations ... 
[20:46:00] <wyre> these kind of things
[20:46:05] <lunaphyte> registrations for what?
[20:47:37] <wyre> lunaphyte, well, I was reading about this https://bootstrapmade.com/php-email-form/ and not sure what's for .. ðŸ¤”
[20:47:57] <lunaphyte> but what's this all actually for?
[20:48:04] <wyre> but I'd say I could receive in my personal email account emails from contact@mysite.dom
[20:48:20] <wyre> it's a bootstrap template for a portfolio
[20:48:31] <wyre> but it has a contact form which requires some kind of php email library ðŸ¤”
[20:48:34] <lunaphyte> what does that mean?
[20:48:41] <wyre> and not sure if you need that email service provider in this case
[20:48:47] <lunaphyte> "bootstrap template for a portfolio"
[20:49:24] <wyre> https://bootstrapmade.com/bootstrap-personal-templates/
[20:49:57] <lunaphyte> oh
[20:51:19] <lunaphyte> well, if what you're interested in is making some web site for something, and you're not interested in being an email admin, then my advice would be to use an email service provider, rather than doing it yourself
[20:51:46] <lunaphyte> if your goal is to be an email admin, though, and to learn all about how email works, then you might want to do it yourself
[20:51:59] <wyre> lunaphyte, some time ago I think I've used this one https://www.mailgun.com/
[20:52:16] <wyre> but I'm not sure if this is actually an "email service provider" ðŸ¤”
[20:53:17] <lunaphyte> you might find some places it call it "email hosting"
[20:53:56] <lunaphyte> an email service provider could provide any number of different email related services.  some may provide only a subset of possible services
[21:00:08] <wyre> lunaphyte, would you say is Mailgun an email service provider then?
[21:00:47] <lunaphyte> they're a "delivery service"
[21:00:59] <lunaphyte> i don't think they provide email hosting services
[21:01:50] <lunaphyte> you want to receive and send email, using your domain name?
[21:04:16] <wyre> lunaphyte, I'm not sure but maybe in a future ... I think I should consider something like google workspace ðŸ¤”
[21:05:23] <lunaphyte> that's a quite common choice
