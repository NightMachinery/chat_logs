[00:01:01] <jcowan> The idea of the PFN is that data structure libraries shouldn't be automatically registering themselves with the defaualt comparator, which is meant for user convenience.
[00:01:30] <dpk> i see
[00:02:52] <jcowan> set-replace  example: you have a set s = {1, 2, 3} with equality predicate `=`.  You can then use (set-replace s 2.0), which rather than throwing an error will give you {1, 2.0, 3}.

[00:10:59] <gwatt> When have you found that to be useful?
[00:18:21] <mnieper> You can implement a map-like structure based on a set with it.
[00:18:32] *** Quits: nestor_ (~nestor@46.166.88.43) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[00:18:59] <mnieper> You model a key/value pair as a pair and the equality predicate for such pairs is just the equality on its car.
[00:19:51] <mnieper> With set-replace you can replace a value with a different one without retrieving the pair first.

[00:29:08] <jcowan> Always useful to have someone around who knows what he's talking about!
[00:35:39] <sham1> I feel that there usually is a reason why sets are based on maps instead of other way around
[00:36:53] <Zipheir> Implementations of sets?
[00:37:13] <Zipheir> Because abstract maps are sets.
[00:40:29] <mnieper> What is the value of a key/value pair if you implement your sets in terms of maps?
[00:41:38] <mnieper> Zipheir: At least in suitable categories. :)
[00:42:11] <Zipheir> mnieper: Yes.
[00:43:20] <Zipheir> jcowan: Seconded.  Now I can rely on mnieper to answer the hard questions. :)
[00:45:33] <jcowan> Well, everybody needs maps, so you can take it for granted that they're around.  If you want a set, it's trivial to do: it's just a map where the values are arbitrary.  SRFI 113 uses 1 as the value because it also has bags, where the value is the number of instances of a given object in the bag.
[00:46:15] <mnieper> Right, I forgot about bags.
[00:46:16] <jcowan> so sets and bags are trivial wrappers around "sobs" which do all the real work, except that a set bounds the values by 1
[00:46:55] <jcowan> There are warnings that what you get out of a set/bag is not necessarily eqv? to what you put in, just the same in the sense of the comparator.
[00:46:56] *** Quits: cedb (~ced@user/ouestbillie) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[00:51:27] <jcowan> Unlike lists, vectors, annd variables, where what you get out *is* eqv? to what you put in.
[00:53:18] <Zipheir> Funky.
[00:55:38] <Zipheir> I wish I'd thought to say something about that in SRFI 224.
[00:55:57] <Zipheir> Whatever the right "something" is.  I'm not really sure.

[10:33:22] <dpk> so, i think i am going to make an executive decision for Codeberg. i will send them a mail to ensure we get 'preserved' status from the beginning so they don't delete our repo if it goes inactive when we're done
[10:34:05] <dpk> on the whole, i think it's a major advantage that they're a German e.V., so anyone can become a member and have an equal say in the governance of the site, including what happens to projects (including ours) if the org or the site were to close down
[10:34:53] <dpk> and unlike other orgs, especially commercial ones (even sourcehut), we have a legal guarantee through the German civil code of our right to be involved in decisions such as that

[11:35:51] <wasamasa> wait, wait
[11:35:57] <wasamasa> codeberg deletes repositories?
[11:38:06] <ecraven> well, you could always sync it from codeberg to other git hosters, such as sourcehut or gitlab
[11:38:24] <ecraven> also, one of the hetzner backup boxes ;)
[11:39:35] <dpk> wasamasa: i don't know if they actively delete repositories, but their terms of use allows them to after certain amounts of inactivity
[11:39:45] <wasamasa> ok
[11:39:53] <dpk> ecraven: it's as much the issue tracker as the actual repo contents
[11:40:09] <ecraven> well, sync that too, there should be a backup anyway, right?
[11:40:31] <ecraven> if they don't provide a decent API, maybe they are the wrong choice ;) [I hadn't heard of them before right now, so no idea]
[11:41:01] <wasamasa> I guess you're refering to https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/org/src/branch/main/TermsOfUse.md#4-cancellation-and-termination
[11:41:06] <wasamasa> > (2) Abandoned user accounts or organizations with no (or extremely few) all-time contributions may be deleted after being unused for 365 days. A warning via email is sent 1 month in advance.
[11:41:41] <wasamasa> which reads to me like database maintenance
[11:42:46] <dpk> ecraven: they're Gitea, and the Gitea API does seem to provide decent access to stuff like that. thanks for volunteering to use it to build a backup tool for us ;-)
[11:43:11] <ecraven> dpk: ask me when everything is set up, I like this kind of smallish tasks
[11:43:21] <ecraven> Everything: sorry, didn't mean to wake you :P
[11:44:02] <dpk> hehe. we'll see what Codeberg says, as i also asked if they could give us backups directly. but (this time sincerely) thanks for the offer!
[11:44:41] <ecraven> I'm cautious to offer more than small amounts of help, as I'm always motivated, but history has shown (see r7rs-benchmarks) that my time is more limited than I'd like it to be :-/
[11:44:57] <ecraven> for example, I (once again) didn't get back to ArneBab about a new run of the benchmarks

[13:13:56] <ecraven> dickbar__: this defines a function iterate, that takes one argument n, and returns a function that takes one argument f
[13:13:59] <dpk> it defines a function called iterate (taking one argument n) which itself returns a function (taking one argument f)
[13:14:10] <ecraven> as dpk says, it's syntax for easier currying

[16:41:33] <edgar-rft> On the other hand, even alone that fact that chicken curry isn't mentioned in the Book of Enoch makes me think that it could be a more modern thing.
[16:42:51] <mnieper> jcowan: For Scheme, sequent calculus may be even more natural than natural deduction.
[16:43:28] <mnieper> To recapitulate: a judgment in natural deduction is of the form A, B, C |- D
[16:44:38] <mnieper> Asserting that when A, B, and C, then D.
[16:45:09] <mnieper> In Scheme, it could be interpreted as a procedure, taking three values (of types A, B, and C) and returning a value of type D.
[16:45:27] <mnieper> A judgment in sequent calculus is of the form A, B, C |- D, E, F.
[16:45:49] <mnieper> In standard interpretation asserting that when A, B, and C, then D, E, or F.
[16:46:43] <mnieper> Now Scheme has procedures of the form A, B, C |- D, E, F. To see this, we just have to remind us of the existence of the amb operator (implementable with call/cc).
[16:48:03] <mnieper> Tentatively, a Scheme procedure could give us a result of type D.  When it can be proven (during runtime) that this is not the right result, we call amb and are suddenly delivered a result of type E, ...

[16:48:49] <mnieper> The point is that while natural deduction naturally models intuitionistic logic, sequent calculus naturally models classical logic.
[16:49:35] <mnieper> And adding call/cc (Peirce's law) to intuitionistic logic allows to derive the rule of the excluded middle and thus gives classical logic.

[18:09:27] <amazigh> They are all syntax related: a) number in library names b) library (foo bar) will be looked up in foo/bar/bar.sld, and c) the beginning of `define-library` support.
[18:09:37] <amazigh> the very beginning of `define-library`
[18:09:57] <amazigh> I am wondering whether using unsyntax will be an easier or better path at least for me
[18:10:19] <mnieper> Numbers in library names are incompatible with some of Chez's native extensions.
[18:10:56] <amazigh> the funny thing is that it manage to compile Chez with the changes, so it is not all wrong.
[18:10:57] <mnieper> The problem is that numbers do not carry a lexical environment as symbols do.
[18:10:58] <amazigh> re unsyntax, is it possible to make it work with REPL?
[18:11:14] <mnieper> Unsyntax has a REPL.
[18:11:51] <amazigh> Then I will investigate that path
[18:12:08] <mnieper> It can make sense to port it to R6RS; then you can run that on Chez for efficiency reasons.

[19:51:08] <sham1> Also I somehow now know how to use syntax-rules. It wasn't as difficult as it looked
[19:51:39] <amazigh> theseb: you need to assign 1 and 2, to variables that lives outside the last mini-env that was pushed

[19:54:21] <amazigh> call-with-values is more verbose but builtin, where receive is https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-8/
[19:54:29] <amazigh> ah yes.
[19:54:45] <amazigh> (apply values (my-proc))
[19:56:04] <sham1> Yeah. Shows that there are many ways of doing this stuff
[19:57:09] <amazigh> (apply values objs) is one of my favorite line of code :)
[19:57:16] <amazigh> idk why
[19:57:25] <sham1> A compiler probably doesn't like that

[19:57:39] *** Joins: badkins (~badkins@136.56.92.199)
[19:57:41] <mnieper> In general, Scheme does not really need destructuring lists into values because the usual strategy would be to define procedures that return multiple values where a, say, C++ function would return a std::pair or a std::tuple.
[19:58:24] <sham1> It's still useful. I tend to use it when I'm in CL land because list surgery at sufficient depth of cars and cdrs is painful
[19:58:34] <Zipheir> Pattern matching!
[19:58:41] <amazigh> ^^
[19:58:46] <mnieper> +1
[19:58:54] * Zipheir checks if SRFI 204 ever completed
[19:59:04] <mnieper> You can use syntax-case.
[19:59:22] <sham1> Yes. Although I'd argue that destructuring a value like this is a quite primitive version of pattern matching
[19:59:24] <Zipheir> Oh, it was withdrawn. :-/
[19:59:38] <amazigh> Zipheir: it is not, SRFI-200 should take back the goal of SRFI-204, with smaller set of features.
[20:01:07] <Zipheir> amazigh: Oh, maybe so, but SRFI 204 is indeed withdrawn.
[20:01:48] *** Quits: badkins (~badkins@136.56.92.199) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[20:01:50] <sham1> SRFI-200 mentions the Wright-Cartwright-Shinn pattern matcher anyway, so I'm not sure if 204 would be needed if 200 is finalised
[20:02:06] <mnieper> IMO, the SRFI 204 matcher is "too untyped". What is really needed is a way to define abstract codata types that then come with their corresponding "typed" matcher.
[20:03:42] <sham1> The example of `palindrome?` in the srfi-200 text is quite nice with how recursively it's defined. It almost looks like Haskell except with parens
[20:03:53] <mnieper> See this for a specialised example for what I have in mind: https://docs.racket-lang.org/nanopass/index.html
[20:04:15] *** Joins: cromyr`` (~user@1.128.107.34)
[20:04:17] <amazigh> what is codata types?
[20:04:22] <amazigh> I am familiar with nanopass
[20:04:46] <sham1> Codata is the opposite of data
[20:04:58] <solrize> codata usually means lazily generated or externally streamed infinite lists
[20:05:18] <solrize> look at "total functional programming" by mike turner iirc

[20:05:44] *** Quits: cromyr` (~user@1.128.105.238) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[20:05:46] <solrize> aha
[20:06:52] <mnieper> You can call codata also a co-inductive data type.  It's a type that comes with destructors.
[20:07:06] <mnieper> An inductive types comes with constructors.
[20:07:23] <mnieper> The natural numbers are inductive. You have the constructors 0 and S: N->N.
[20:07:50] <solrize> was there an article about how manopass works?  what all the passes do i mean
[20:08:07] <mnieper> Infinite lists form a co-inductive data type. You can destruct them into head and tail.
[20:09:02] <mnieper> solrize: The nanopass framework is just a big macro package that helps destruct and construct grammar elements.
[20:09:16] <mnieper> It does not define any passes, but can be used inside a compiler.
[20:09:25] <mnieper> It is used inside Chez, for example.
[20:09:27] <solrize> oh i thought it had a set of compiler passes

[20:09:40] <sham1> It is quite weirdly named
[20:09:48] <gwatt> https://github.com/nanopass/nanopass-framework-scheme
[20:09:56] <gwatt> It's a framework for defining passes
[20:09:59] <Zipheir> solrize: The general idea is a tool that makes it possible to write a compiler as a series of more-or-less minute transformations.
[20:10:21] <amazigh> nanopass provides strict type checking unlike using `match` with symbols and lists. 
[20:10:42] <mnieper> For concrete passes, take a look at Chez's cpnanopass.ss, for example.
[20:10:49] <solrize> yes but i thought it was sort of like gcc where it included an IR and a bunch of IR passes so a real compiler would come out after you wrote a grammar
[20:10:59] <solrize> aha looking at chez sounds good
[20:11:10] <sham1> Yeah, nanopass doesn't do IR stuff
[20:11:10] <mnieper> solrize: No, it is much more primitive.
[20:11:17] <solrize> oh well thanks
[20:11:29] *** Joins: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth)
[20:11:49] <mnieper> But we really want this in more generality in Scheme.
[20:12:13] <mnieper> The use cases of an untyped SRFI 204 are really small.
[20:12:26] <mnieper> (When such other framework is available.)
[20:13:59] <mnieper> Using SRFI 213 and syntax-case, it can be realised. I may write such a thing one day.
[20:14:00] *** Joins: seninha (~chatzilla@user/seninha)
[20:14:00] <Zipheir> mnieper: Would you compare this to the practice of writing a quick "typed" matching macro, e.g. if I have a type (τ bar baz) then the matcher would be (match-τ (bar-pattern baz-pattern) <body>), or something like that.
[20:14:56] <mnieper> Yes, I think of something like (define-union-type foo (tau bar baz) (sigma quux))
[20:15:06] <mnieper> Which defines foo-case
[20:15:29] <Zipheir> Right.  Nice idea.
[20:15:31] <mnieper> (foo-case ((tau x y) ...) (sigma u v))
[20:15:41] <mnieper> Syntax is probably broken, but that's the idea.
[20:15:50] <Zipheir> Very much like Racket's define-datatype.
[20:16:04] <mnieper> I have to take a look at that. Didn't know about it.
[20:16:50] <Zipheir> It's a similar idea.  It defines a (cases ...) macro with clauses for each constructor.  It's used extensively in Friedman & Wand's EOPL.
[20:17:03] <mnieper> Maybe we should stop here and just turn all to Racket. :) Everything that's inventable, is seemingly already there.
