Head moderator Doreen Ford went on with Fox host Jesse Watters for an interview that would demonstrate every stereotype about the group and…)
[03:29:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Interesting article
[03:30:26] <gwern> (how many non-warehouse-ish employees does amazon have, I wonder...)
[03:30:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> "So how did it all happen? Why was Doreen Ford, of all people able to appoint herself as representative of a self-proclaimed movement 1.7 million strong? Why, after hagiographies from the New York Times, Vice, the Washington Post, and others, was a lazy anarchist dog walker able to irreparably shatter the image of the space in a single interview?
[03:30:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> The start of the answer lies in the simple truth of who Doreen Ford was: the person who almost single-handedly built the space, indisputably the single most accurate representative and the one most qualified to understand it."
[03:30:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The users of /r/antiwork want to frame its story as one of mod hubris and righteous user revolt, one in which delusional wannabe leaders without a clue about their own movement carelessly ignored the will of the movement for their own glorification. It’s a tidy, gratifying framing.
[03:30:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Unfortunately, it’s also false. A broader look finds a more compelling story, one in which a subreddit grew faster and further than it was ever supposed to, and in doing so caused millions to wholly misunderstand the very movement they were joining. Users first sanewashed its ideas to suit their preferences, then gentrified the space to rid it of the rough edges left by its founding crew."
[03:30:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Ideological anarchism and a strict anti-work streak were not unique to the founder of the sub or to Doreen Ford ... What exactly did they mean by abolishing work? The answer they’d most eagerly endorse was: overthrow capitalism in favor of an anarcho-communism in which nobody would labor for others’ profit. Practically speaking, they suggest that people would naturally gravitate towards what needed to be done of their own
[03:30:56] <Obormot\Arcturus>  accord. From my own less sympathetic view, the image that always comes to mind is the classic thread “whats your job on the leftist commune??”, in which everyone plans to lead discussion on theory and make lattes and there’s nary a Coal Mining Enjoyer to be found. But abolishing work, not reforming or reducing it, was always the vision."

[09:57:11] <PapuaHardyNet> no
[09:57:11] <nshepperd2> if it was a generalized prediction (like a future?) that could go negative, then its price could represent the NPV of being paid money now to take on the risk that you have to pay back if the exit scam *does not* happen
[09:57:35] <nshepperd2> but that won't work because it requires prediction market users to have unsecured debt

[10:29:15] <feep[work]> weird math question
[10:29:56] <feep[work]> let's say we have a vector of size n indicating the probability of a system being in one of n states, starting out as <1/n, 1/n, 1/n, 1/n...> or sth
[10:30:04] <PapuaHardyNet> yes
[10:30:16] <feep[work]> and a transition matrix that for each state n gives probabilities of ending up in each target state
[10:30:37] <feep[work]> and we're trying to judge how the distribution of probabilities will be at the limit
[10:30:49] <feep[work]> ie. how distributed 
[10:31:09] <feep[work]> with the goal of avoiding matrices that end up concentrating all probability into a subset of the states
[10:31:12] <feep[work]> is there any way to do that?
[10:31:45] <PapuaHardyNet> the transition matrix reminds me of reinforcement learning
[10:31:59] <feep[work]> keeping in mind that the matrix may be bistable, ie. contain cycles for say the first n/2 and the second n/2, and that is also a loss state even if the final probability is 1/n for every state
[10:32:02] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps you could create a loss function whose aim is to minimize the concentration of probability anywhere
[10:32:15] <nshepperd2> the fixed point is an eigenvector of the transition matrix
[10:32:39] <feep[work]> ie. really what I'm asking is if any given probability distribution ends up well distributed at convergence
[10:32:46] <feep[work]> -given
[10:33:01] <feep[work]> including like, <0, 1, 0, 0...>
[10:33:32] <PapuaHardyNet> okay hold on, what probabilities can we modify? the vector, the matrix, or both?
[10:33:52] <PapuaHardyNet> also, nshepperd probably can help you out here, I'm too uhh... wordcel
[10:33:53] <feep[work]> the matrix, the vector is indeterminate (except sum 1)
[10:34:17] <feep[work]> but I'd be happy with a metric given a matrix, I can just rerandomize it a few thousand times
[10:34:28] <feep[work]> keeping in mind a realistic n will be something like 5 or 6
[10:34:28] <PapuaHardyNet> oh interesting, is this related to fflame?
[10:34:38] <feep[work]> yep! I'm thinking of limiting transitions between component functions
[10:35:01] <feep[work]> and I'm trying to avoid the iterated function falling into an internal attractor
[10:35:51] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: ie. right now the matrix is <<1/n, 1/n, 1/n....>, ...>
[10:36:09] <feep[work]> kinda boring ^^
[10:38:34] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. so you want the matrix to be modified such that the state transition (regardless of the probability distribution of the start state) is equivalently distributed
[10:38:42] <feep[work]> yep
[10:38:45] <feep[work]> preferably without being boring
[10:39:23] <feep[work]> ie. it can and should have internal structure, just not such as to drive one component to zero
[10:39:46] <feep[work]> reinforcement learning may not be a bad analogy here
[10:39:48] <PapuaHardyNet> I would create a batch of randomly generated start states, and put it through the transition matrix, and get out the next states, then compare the probability distribution of the next-states set with a uniform distribution to get an error metric
[10:39:57] <feep[work]> just try it out?
[10:39:59] <PapuaHardyNet> then I would minimize this error metric using gradient descent
[10:40:13] <nshepperd> you can do exponentiation by squaring to compute T^256 or something and compare how close its columns are to 1/n
[10:40:24] <feep[work]> oh shit
[10:40:35] <feep[work]> you're right XD I can quickly generate large iteratedly applied versions of the matrix
[10:40:56] <PapuaHardyNet> oh! I see
[10:41:14] <feep[work]> because there's no nonlinear step
[10:41:17] <PapuaHardyNet> by multiplying the transition matrix with itself, you are seeing the "third states"
[10:41:41] <PapuaHardyNet> by doing T**256, you can easily see if accumulation occurs
[10:41:45] <feep[work]> mm
[10:41:48] <feep[work]> good idea nshepperd thank you
[10:42:06] <feep[work]> I mean, do it a few more times and I got T**1e10 or whatever
[10:42:14] <feep[work]> this is not hard to converge :D
[10:42:19] <nshepperd> yeah
[10:42:20] <PapuaHardyNet> impressive, yes. I'll try reading a linalg textbook to get to 10% of nshepperd's level
[10:42:52] <feep[work]> .note feep do that matrix thing
[10:43:00] <nshepperd> you can sample from a dirichlet distribution to get random columns what add up to 1, to generate candidate transition matrix
[10:43:16] <feep[work]> or just normalize I guess
[10:43:16] <PapuaHardyNet> actually, I wonder what textbook / ??? nshepperd would recommend to get better at linalg, if anything
[10:43:47] <feep[work]> :tempted to add matrices to the compiler:
[10:43:59] <feep[work]> nuh! let it be usercode :V
[10:44:02] <nshepperd> idk tbh i haven't read a textbook in years
[10:44:06] <PapuaHardyNet> chad
[10:46:15] <PlanckWalk> You can explicitly solve for the Markov recurrence too
[10:46:25] <PlanckWalk> Which is yes linear algebra
[10:46:40] <PlanckWalk> If there is a limit, then it satisfies  M v = v
[10:47:06] <PlanckWalk> Which you can write as  (M-I) v = 0,  a system of linear equations to solve for v.
[10:47:11] <feep[work]> PlanckWalk: I don't think there's necessarily a limit
[10:47:16] <feep[work]> consider ((0, 1), (1, 0))
[10:47:24] <PlanckWalk> Yes, for some systems there isn't
[10:47:58] <PlanckWalk> You can in general find eigenvalues to determine convergence and speed of convergence.
[10:48:06] <nshepperd> an eigenvector decomposition tells you all the fixed points
[10:48:11] <kuudes> feep[work], it is in wikipedia
[10:50:24] <feep[work]> I mean, again, something like 0 1 1 0, an oscillator, wouldn't have any fixed points, right?
[10:50:41] <PlanckWalk> ((0, 1), (1, 0))  has eigenvalues +1 and -1
[10:50:44] <feep[work]> hm, that might be awkward for the squaring approach as well
[10:50:47] <nshepperd> ah yeah, the eigenvalues tell you whether it converges to that fixed point from a given start
[10:51:03] <PlanckWalk> It does have fixed point (1/2, 1/2) for example
[10:51:10] <feep[work]> oh true
[10:51:24] <feep[work]> well but it's not a very interesting fixed point
[10:51:28] <feep[work]> because the system doesn't converge on it
[10:51:30] <PlanckWalk> But with an eigenvalue -1 it won't converge to that from anything else.
[10:53:39] <kuudes> diagonalization trick is mentioned often
[10:53:47] <PlanckWalk> The corresponding eigenvectors are  (-x, x),  which aren't valid probability distributions in themselves, but still tell you that if you break the distribution down into the eigenvector directions, that component is just going to flip back and forth.
[10:54:08] <PlanckWalk> It's not going to damp out over iterations
[10:54:09] <kuudes> A = PDP⁻¹ <=> lim A^n = lim PD^nP⁻¹
[10:54:37] <feep[work]> I don't want it to damp out
[10:55:02] <feep[work]> I just want it to avoid "boring states". I guess I'm asking for the dimensionality of the iterated path.
[10:55:32] <feep[work]> ie. something like 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 converges to a point, ie. 0d
[10:55:53] <kuudes> if it is cyclical, then there exists n where A^n = I
[10:55:53] <feep[work]> our oscillator keeps going back and forth between two points, d=1 ... or something
[10:56:14] <feep[work]> I don't particularly even mind it being cyclical I guess
[10:56:19] <feep[work]> hm
[10:56:25] <feep[work]> quality is a hard metric to define here.
[10:56:44] <feep[work]> let's turn around and define fail criteria. if one component goes to 1 or 0 at the limit, that's a failure.
[10:57:11] <feep[work]> beyond that I would like the path the system takes to be "interesting", ie. high-dimensional, but that's so hard to define I might as well ignore it
[10:57:37] <kuudes> kernel?
[10:57:46] <feep[work]> I don't follow
[10:58:02] <kuudes> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(linear_algebra)
[10:58:03] <Robomot> Kernel (linear algebra) - Wikipedia (In mathematics, the kernel of a linear map, also known as the null space or nullspace, is the linear subspace of the domain of the map which is mapped to the zero vector.[1] That is, given a linear map L : V → W between two vector spaces V and W, the kernel of L is the vector space of all elements v of V such that L(v) = 0, where 0 denotes the zero vector in W,[2] or more …)
[10:58:19] <PapuaHardyNet> everyone knows linalg so well here smh
[10:58:27] <feep[work]> I have no idea what that means :D
[10:58:39] <kuudes> feep[work], basicly dimensionality of the matrix
[10:58:47] <feep[work]> I guessssss??
[10:59:01] <kuudes> ie how many vectors you need to generate the soace matrix defines
[10:59:03] <feep[work]> kuudes: for context, fractal flame is an iterated function system, ie. there are n (nonlinear) functions that can be applied to a point
[10:59:06] <kuudes> *space
[10:59:09] <feep[work]> oyeah that sounds right
[10:59:34] <feep[work]> kuudes: I want to improve it by instead of randomly picking a next function to apply to a point, picking the next function depending on the current.
[10:59:36] <PlanckWalk> For Markov processes there are pretty tight restrictions on the long-run behaviour
[10:59:44] <linear> PapuaHardyNet: this makes me feel lacking in comparison, given my nick
[10:59:45] <feep[work]> oyeah yeah, this is a markov walk
[11:01:24] <PapuaHardyNet> linear: gonna change my nick to "algebra"
[11:01:46] <PapuaHardyNet> as a sign of solidarity
[11:02:12] <nshepperd> the columns of T^lots being close to 1/n uniform seems like what you want
[11:02:28] <feep[work]> yeah I'll do that first thing, it seems good
[11:02:38] <feep[work]> after work tho XD
[11:03:06] <PapuaHardyNet> why columns?
[11:03:36] <kuudes> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Discrete-time_Markov_chain
[11:03:36] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, that is because each column is a slice representing the transition from all listed states, to a specific state
[11:03:37] <Robomot> Markov chain - Wikipedia [Discrete-time Markov chain] (A discrete-time Markov chain is a sequence of random variables X1, X2, X3, ... with the Markov property, namely that the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the present state and not on the previous states:)
[11:04:27] <PapuaHardyNet> also I just realized that whenever anyone talks about linear algebra, you get pinged hahahah
[11:04:35] <PlanckWalk> So basically you want (1/n) to be an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1, and all the other eigenvalues to be <1 is absolute value.
[11:04:36] <linear> yes but this is a Feature not a bug 
[11:05:00] <PlanckWalk> (So that you get convergence to that vector)
[11:05:46] * feep[work] afk
[11:05:51] <nshepperd> PapuaHardyNet: other way around, a column represents where you go from a given state
[11:06:52] <nshepperd> PlanckWalk: ah yeah that makes sense
[11:06:57] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd: but... I don't get it. then why not just make everything 1/n?
[11:07:14] <PapuaHardyNet> if you want the outcomes to not be concentrated, then shouldn't you try to ensure... oh okay
[11:07:17] <PapuaHardyNet> no you are right
[11:07:26] <PlanckWalk> That's one solution, but it might be a bit "sudden" :-)
[11:07:42] <nshepperd> The idea is to have a matrix T so that T^lots is just full of 1/n but T itself isn't, to be more interesting
[11:08:12] <PapuaHardyNet> right, I didn't realize that
[11:09:21] <nshepperd> PlanckWalk: can you construct a matrix with this property by the eigenvalue decomposition or something
[11:10:28] <nshepperd> like start with a random matrix, do eigenvalue decomposition, set the first eigenvalue and eigenvector to what we want, then the other eigenvalues to <1 then undecompose?
[11:12:10] <feep[work]> basically, the transition graph should be completely reachable
[11:12:16] <feep[work]> because this conversation was missing graph theory to be complete
[11:12:59] <PlanckWalk> Yes, you can construct matrices with given eigenvalues pretty easily
[11:14:40] <feep[work]> thinking about it some more, it actually seems like most matrices should be fine? 
[11:14:56] <feep[work]> if I just lower-bound the probability of every state transition to 0.01 or something
[11:15:01] <PlanckWalk> Yes, all but a measure-zero set
[11:15:11] <feep[work]> right, so the whole thing is a non-issue carry on!
[11:15:15] <PlanckWalk> And yeah, that would guarantee that it's fine
[11:15:29] <feep[work]> XD
[11:15:38] <PlanckWalk> Well, not that it woudl converge to (1/n)
[11:15:46] <feep[work]> I just want it to not converge to 0 or 1.
[11:15:50] <PlanckWalk> But no absorbing states
[11:15:56] <feep[work]> yea
[11:26:29] <kuudes> well, as long as any row does not have all-0 but diagonal, that state will not capture the result for good
[11:27:09] <feep[work]> kuudes: well that's not a given
[11:27:29] <feep[work]> kuudes: or rather, that state may not capture that result but you can still have disconnected parts of the state vector
[11:27:45] <feep[work]> I forgot what the name for that is, a matrix that is ((m 0) (0 n))
[11:27:56] <kuudes> diagonal?
[11:28:02] <feep[work]> sorry
[11:28:06] <feep[work]> I forgot what the name for that is, a matrix that is ((<m> 0) (0 <n>))
[11:28:12] <feep[work]> m* 0*
[11:28:29] <feep[work]> factorizable?
[11:29:25] <kuudes> yeah, if it can be gauss transformed into matrix with full 0-squares in it, those parts are not connected, yes
[11:29:29] <feep[work]> the point is <m> only transitions to <m>, and <n> only transitions to <n>
[11:29:31] <feep[work]> yeah

[11:36:06] <feep[work]> kuudes: yep
[11:36:07] <feep[work]> thanks
[12:06:04] <PapuaHardyNet> I recall reading a probability book years ago, where they asked a question: you flip a coin, and the number of times it comes heads is more than that of the number of times it comes as tails
[12:07:40] <PapuaHardyNet> for 100 flips, what is the maximum number of heads you can get before you can conclude that the number of heads is too high for a fair coin flip?
[12:08:19] <feep[work]> I mean
[12:08:24] <feep[work]> you can conclude whatever you want whenever you want
[12:08:26] <PapuaHardyNet> I may have gotten the question a bit incorrect, but the point was, the solution involved taking the root of the number of coin flips (10 in this case), and seeing if the extra flips was less or greater than that
[12:09:06] <PapuaHardyNet> feep: I dunno, it's been years! What I really want is a way to decide whether a correlation is meaningless or spurious, given a specific size of population

[22:13:45] <Robomot> Opinion | What We Can Learn From How the 1918 Pandemic Ended - The New York Times (Overconfidence, indifference and weariness are perhaps the biggest dangers.)
[22:14:12] <kuudes> "Nearly all cities in the United States imposed restrictions during the pandemic’s virulent second wave, which peaked in the fall of 1918. That winter, some cities reimposed controls when a third, though less deadly, wave struck. But virtually no city responded in 1920. People were weary of influenza, and so were public officials. Newspapers were filled with frightening news about the virus, but no one cared. People at the time ignored this fourth wave
[22:14:12] <kuudes> ; so did historians. Deaths returned to pre-pandemic levels in 1921, and the virus mutated into ordinary seasonal influenza, but the world had moved on well before."
[22:15:36] <kuudes> "In the 2009 pandemic, variants also emerged that caused breakthrough infections; one study in Britain found a “greater burden of severe illness in the year after the pandemic” but “much less public interest in influenza.” Researchers blamed the government’s approach for that. In the first year, the public health response was “highly assertive,” chiefly in providing information; there were no lockdowns. In the second year, the
[22:15:36] <kuudes> y found, “the approach was laissez-faire.” As a result, “a large number of deaths, critical care and hospital admissions occurred, many of these in otherwise healthy people of working age.”"
[22:15:38] <two2thehead> so the magic number seems to be three years for pandemic fatigue to set in, ceteris paribus
[22:16:08] <kuudes> it still seems the current low hanging fruit is to just give people more boosters as long as they take them
