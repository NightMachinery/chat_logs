[05:31:33] <causative> you could say "we're heading for a period of decline" at literally any point in history and be correct
[05:32:05] <causative> also you could say "we're heading for a period of prosperity" and be equally correct
[05:32:51] <I_Am_M00t> nope on both counts
[05:33:23] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: very covid-like
[05:33:42] <I_Am_M00t> woah, i heard Norway opened up with wild parties
[05:33:46] <I_Am_M00t> not tru?
[05:33:53] <causative> you can't say nope to that
[05:33:55] <zicada> that was a few months before this
[05:34:02] <I_Am_M00t> causative: sure i can
[05:34:06] <zicada> closed back up again when Omicron came along
[05:34:11] <causative> it's obvious
[05:34:22] <I_Am_M00t> zicada: so like a week?
[05:34:46] <causative> for example, the great depression was a period of decline.  So at any point in history prior to the great depression, you could say "we're headed for a period of decline" and be correct.
[05:34:47] <zicada> I_Am_M00t: nah like since summer really until what, October ?
[05:34:59] <zicada> late Oct early Nov or os
[05:35:04] <I_Am_M00t> i thought omicron was like ... last week or something, haha
[05:35:09] <I_Am_M00t> yeah, ok
[05:35:14] <zicada> depends where you live heh
[05:35:24] <I_Am_M00t> norwegians are true pioneers
[05:35:40] <zicada> but it was December wasnt it
[05:35:57] <causative> and the 1990s was a period of prosperity. So at any point in history prior to the 1990s you could say "we're headed for a period of prosperity"
[05:36:20] <zicada> i remember week 52 being the highest recorded infections ever globally, and also the fewest deaths in a year globally.
[05:36:20] <I_Am_M00t> yeah i think december
[05:36:29] <causative> there's no way to prove such claims wrong, all you can do is wait until they come true
[05:36:29] <zicada> generally good news for omicron, that
[05:36:38] <I_Am_M00t> causative: sure there is, it's wrong
[05:36:52] <I_Am_M00t> yeah, supposedly omicron is less lethal
[05:37:03] <causative> 👎
[05:37:05] <I_Am_M00t> can't keep track of all the variants
[05:37:39] <zicada> uncaccinated being infected with this means much lower chance of death, but being vaccinated against the deadlier versions
[05:38:13] <zicada> so its about managing how quickly to let ones populations get infected vs how overworked hospitals get, at this point i suppose
[05:39:09] <I_Am_M00t> no idea, i thought vaccines lowered mortality rate for omicron too
[05:39:17] <Ungwelian> I find the general response to Covid pretty depressing :F
[05:39:48] <Ungwelian> Very few countries seemed to take it seriously. And a lot of propaganda was going around.
[05:40:13] <I_Am_M00t> wasn't iceland quite successful in their response? (although, they're physically isolated from the world, so... )

[06:40:29] <vysn> and just to get back to my original point, and from a philosophical point of view, a nuclear war might not necessarily mean extinction, perhaps just a cycle, a reassignment of roles between human populations if you will.
[06:41:09] <causative> also even if you do die to a nuclear explosion, you have to be very close to the epicenter to actually be obliterated without a trace

[06:50:08] <causative> sure, it will, but we won't find a nuclear-age civilization before us
[06:50:12] <vysn> it is unwise in my humble opinion to think that what we are told is set in stone. (pun intended)
[06:51:36] <causative> the only way a nuclear-age civilization could have happened that we don't know about, is if it was confined to a small area of the globe that we haven't happened upon or that was located entirely in a subduction zone that disappeared into the mantle

[06:57:47] <vysn> compared to us when though? where we are now is orders of magnitude different to what we where a 100 years ago. what about a 100 years form now?
[06:59:30] <causative> if they managed to get far more advanced than us, then I bet they'd still be around
[07:00:07] <causative> and if they wanted to hide from us, maybe they are still around

[07:00:46] <causative> but it seems weird that they would abandon all their own goals to just hide and watch humans develop
[07:01:01] <causative> it doesn't make sense to me what their motive for that could be
[07:08:20] <vysn> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silurian_hypothesis
[07:08:20] <ro-bot-o> [url] Silurian hypothesis - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[07:10:07] <causative> hmm, they say "little of Earth's exposed surface is from before the Quaternary time period"
[07:10:50] <causative> which was 2.6 mya.  if that's true then maybe there could be a past civ a few million years ago
[07:11:51] <causative> but if there was, then why didn't they use up all the oil before we did?
[07:12:24] <causative> I wonder what the mean by "exposed surface"
[07:12:47] <causative> appalachian mountains are 480 million years old
[07:13:08] <causative> rocky mountains, 55 to 80 million
[07:13:47] <causative> so I don't know what they mean with their claim about the quaternary period, which was much more recent than that
[07:14:03] <causative> we have fossils from dinosaurs from hundreds of mya
[07:14:23] <thunder> tangent: silures/silurians were a tribe in south wales who probably originated in north africa and migrated into the british isles. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silures#The_term_%22Silurian%22
[07:14:23] <ro-bot-o> [url] Silures - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[07:14:47] <causative> if we can find dinosaur fossils, we would also be able to find stone or glass or gold artifacts from a global civilization
[07:14:56] <causative> hundreds of mya
[07:15:19] <causative> in the same strata
[07:19:34] <causative> though on the other hand, dinosaurs were around for a very long time, giving them many more chances to leave evidence than a presumably short-lived sapient civilization
[07:23:58] <causative> but a stone artifact is much more easily preserved than a fossil

[12:57:29] <arryana> if you ever meet anyone who has their shit together in more than a couple of ways, they've got a level of 'self-knowledge'.  but that's visible from the outside.  anyone who just tells you they've achieved such a thing is trying to sell you something.

[12:58:10] <arryana> morning, lumi.
[12:59:38] <Delf> arryana: That's a very nice way of trying to say that I've said that I've reached full self-knowledge. I got some news for you, I'm far from it.
[12:59:50] <Lumine> Making assumptions about the final state of the human mind while simultaneously claiming that nobody has ever achieved it, I'm pretty sure there's a term for this, if only my mind would help me out here.
[13:00:39] <arryana> that's not what i said.
[13:00:51] <Delf> My bad then, I totally misunderstood your point
[13:00:58] <arryana> you usually do.
[13:01:14] <arryana> but we come from very different perspectives.
[13:01:37] <arryana> i don't think any person is a finished thing
[13:01:53] <arryana> even if they manage, the next thing to happen requires adjustment all over again
[13:04:08] <arryana> somewhere along the line progress started being called failure, and failure became a sin, sadly
[13:04:38] * Delf is not a sinner
[13:04:41] <arryana> learning is a messy thing, and there's no skipping steps.  i'm not sure why that got turned into personal failings in the minds of so many.
[13:05:26] <Delf> That's related to our way of structuring ourselves in relation to each other
[13:05:39] <Delf> We shun those that made mistakes
[13:05:41] <arryana> i always save my first attempts at learning anything, for both encouragement and perspective.  like my first crochet/knitting things could have been done better by a three fingered six year old.
[13:05:56] <arryana> it's ridiculous to compare yourself to anyone els.
[13:05:59] <arryana> nobody walks the same path
[13:06:51] <Delf> We are compelled to compare, to see difference, to tell failure from success apart
[13:08:39] <Delf> Take for example all the things you wouldn't do, if you were me :P
[13:09:38] <arryana> you might be.  not everyone is.
[13:09:57] <arryana> i don't know or care. that's your baggage to carry.
[13:11:26] <Delf> So, you don't compare yourself with others, you compare the beliefs and actions of others with those of yours?
[13:12:00] <arryana> i listen to learn.  i have no interest in comparing.
[13:12:32] <Delf> You learn without comparing?
[13:13:45] <arryana> of course
[13:14:17] <arryana> bite an apple and you find out what it tastes like, what the texture is like, even if you don't know what an orange is like.

[14:52:26] <Delf> Interesting. I had to look that word up. How so?
[14:54:05] <evolv> you talk a lot
[14:56:04] <Delf> Fucking hell, what an insult mate. You don't see the weight in my words?
[14:58:17] <arryana> why would you think your words are of any more value than anyone else's here?
[14:58:36] <evolv> Delf, words are weightless
[14:58:42] <arryana> you're always admitting that you're lying or 'kidding', you're more unreliable than most.
[15:01:03] <Delf> So you two agree that my words are worthless?
[15:03:03] <arryana> honestly, you need to discuss this stuff with a therapist instead of trying to turn this room into conversations all about you so often.
[15:03:46] <pussipupu> Atque: maybe so but I can't figure out how to configure the things I want to
[15:04:16] <pussipupu> And it doesn't provide me any obvious advantages over the Linux distro I use
[15:05:52] <arryana> if you bring up a topic or a perspective which is worth discussing, people will discuss it.  apart from that, why would i give any thought to anything you say?
[15:06:22] <Delf> That's a big if. Also, you seem to ask great questions. Makes me wonder
[15:12:52] <evolv> Delf, I didn't say worthless, I said words are weightless
[15:12:58] <evolv> they literally don't have weight

[15:14:55] <thelma_> I like hearing what Delf has to say.
[15:14:57] <Delf> But talking a lot, and in this case I would be safe to assume that means too much/excessive. So I talk much without managing to say something of weight, in this case being not worth saying
[15:16:15] <arryana> i don't see why you care what opinion total strangers have of you anyway.
[15:17:28] <Delf> Why thanks you, thelma_. I'd like to hear more about what you has to say

[16:13:35] <arryana> give it a rest already
[16:14:54] <evolv> Delf, the more you judge others, the more you judge yourself; the more you judge yourself, the more you judge others. Therefore it's best not to judge yourself nor to judge others. :)
