[03:10:56] <biys> in no way comparable to like... dostoevsky
[03:11:04] <biys> In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality. At times monstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are so truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but so artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like Pushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them i
[03:11:10] <biys> n the waking state. Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.
[03:12:35] <biys> this is dostoevsky's recalling of the horse being flogged to death
[03:13:09] <biys> audrey: what do you think of the similarities between Nietasche's horse and dostoevsky's horse?

[13:58:31] <arryana> heya
[14:01:37] <arryana> how often do you make such things, lumi?
[14:01:40] <bittersweetsymph> Haven't got anything to say much today just saying hi
[14:01:49] <arryana> no worries, text is low pressure
[14:02:03] <arryana> my hands are largely occupied with a crochet project at the moment anyway
[14:02:26] <arryana> you picked a good time, i was just ordering a spare set of cheap hooks to try cutting them up and adapting them for my mother in law.
[14:02:50] <arryana> her hands are arthritic, and i'd like to see if i can make something which allows her to crochet again
[14:03:01] <bittersweetsymph> Oh I might like to learn to do that one day.
[14:03:25] <bittersweetsymph> That is very nice of you.
[14:03:30] <Lumine> arryana: it varies from quick pics multiple times a day to one every few days when i'm in the groove, right now working on a gift for the next week
[14:03:33] <arryana> i find it absolutely delightful, i started learning because she offered to teach me, and she's such a sweet lady i had no intention of refusing any gesture she made
[14:03:52] <arryana> oh, i'm just returning a favor.  i wouldn't be able to knit or crochet without her
[14:04:08] <arryana> that's brilliant, lumi.
[14:04:17] <arryana> not only talent, but talent that demands to be used.
[14:04:20] <arryana> a rare combination.
[14:04:34] <arryana> one of my brothers is an artist, and he's amazingly talented.  only he doesn't give a crap to do it.
[14:05:43] <arryana> i always found that baffling.
[14:09:02] *** Joins: chomwitt (~chomwitt@2a02:587:dc0d:3700:12c3:7bff:fe6d:d374)
[14:09:57] <bittersweetsymph> Shame to see good talent unused. What kind of art does he do?
[14:10:19] <arryana> it used to be ink sketches
[14:10:25] <arryana> to my knowledge he hasn't done one for a decade
[14:11:02] <arryana> when he's been in financial trouble i've personally attempted to commission one to get him some cash and to give as a gift to someone else, but he refused.
[14:11:43] <arryana> one of the places i work offered to hang some of his stuff on the wall with a card giving his name and information, among other artists' works.  they often got new buyers that way.
[14:11:48] <arryana> but he refused that too.
[14:11:49] * arryana shrugs
[14:12:34] <bittersweetsymph> Maybe he is not confident in his own ability, who knows. My sister is also a great artist with probably not enough time to do it.
[14:12:47] <arryana> maybe it was made too easy for him and he just didn't care.  ten or fifteen years before our father died, he paid $30k to have a print series of my brother's work done, for my brother to sell.
[14:12:59] <arryana> my brother kept them in his garage for a while and then threw them away
[14:13:04] <bittersweetsymph> She has done some very good realist paintings but hardly has the time for it now.
[14:13:10] * arryana nods
[14:13:43] <arryana> i have no idea what it is.  i do know that he doesn't enjoy drawing itself, he only does it in public places so people can 'ooh' and 'ahh' over his work.
[14:13:58] <bittersweetsymph> Sounds like maybe he lacks confidence in his ability who knows.
[14:14:22] <bittersweetsymph> Oh he doesn't enjoy it but he is good at it?
[14:14:22] <arryana> i'd be amazed, he's had some exposure that should have taught him differently
[14:14:33] * arryana nods
[14:14:40] <bittersweetsymph> Maybe he is a perfectionist and only sees the imperfections who knows.
[14:14:50] <arryana> not to be harsh, but it's really the -only- thing he's really good at.
[14:15:13] <arryana> i'm the other way, i'm passably good at most things, but not exceedingly talented in anything.
[14:15:23] <bittersweetsymph> Hmm
[14:15:37] <arryana> probably the thing i'm best at is engraving, but i've put that aside for a bit
[14:16:32] <arryana> that's a practicality issue, though, it's $5k of equipment, and until recently, i never had a space which would be safe to contain that much sharp and dangerous gear sufficiently carefully.
[14:16:58] <arryana> and now i tell myself i need to wrap up all the other projects i have going before i go and set that up, or i'll never finish them at all.
[14:20:29] <bittersweetsymph> My Mum used to do engraving, of things like trophies, plaques and rings I think.
[14:20:36] <arryana> i suppose if i'm entirely honest, part of it is that i know i don't (yet) have the balls to be a stonesetter, and that bothers me.  but every time i blow up a stone i feel like i've killed something
[14:20:41] <arryana> oh, that's amazing
[14:20:48] <arryana> trophies can be a real bitch
[14:21:15] <bittersweetsymph> Yeah I never realised how multifaceted she really was
[14:21:19] <arryana> i never got past the student phase, bracelets, pendants, plates.
[14:21:25] <bittersweetsymph> Multitalented*
[14:21:41] <arryana> i did learn a bit of inlay
[14:21:47] <bittersweetsymph> As a kid
[14:22:08] <arryana> kids never see their parents for the people they are, until they're much, much older
[14:22:10] <arryana> if at all
[14:23:09] <arryana> i was fortunate enough to have seriously dysfunctional parents, as well as leaving home very early, so i got to know my parents as people
[14:23:13] <arryana> and even one of my grandmothers.
[14:24:23] <arryana> my mother is still alive, though she's been terminal for a number of years.  that also strips away a lot of the standard parent/child stuff
[14:28:09] <arryana> while i'm pro-assisted-suicide, i wonder about the sociological implications of removing that sort of interaction.
[14:28:54] <bittersweetsymph> Oh what age did you leave. She would make cloths, bed spread, knit jumpers, crochet, make matchboxes, cook any sort of different food all while working full time and often studying.
[14:29:01] <arryana> 14
[14:29:14] <arryana> i was emancipated, and bailed the scene
[14:29:28] <bittersweetsymph> s/matchboxes patchwork autocomplete
[14:29:39] <arryana> that's amazing, my mother in law is like that
[14:29:41] <bittersweetsymph> That is young.
[14:29:48] <arryana> she made all sorts of stuff for her kids, still does.
[14:30:26] <arryana> eh, it worked out for me, i had a great deal more of life than i would have had with a more standard childhood
[14:31:22] <arryana> it makes me something of a mental hypocrite, though, as an old lady now i'd -never- do that to a kid.
[14:32:34] <bittersweetsymph> I think more people did leave school and sometimes home earlier in the past but that is still very young.
[14:32:34] <arryana> but if given a magic wand which allowed me to re-do my life, by whatever arrangement i want, i still wouldn't trade it.
[14:32:44] <arryana> oh, no, i still had to go to school
[14:32:59] <arryana> i couch-surfed until i was fifteen and then lived in my car
[14:33:00] <bittersweetsymph> Makes you stronger and more independent in some ways probably.
[14:33:19] <arryana> i was born independent, which i suspect insulated me from a lot of the damage
[14:33:20] <bittersweetsymph> Wow that sounds tough
[14:33:38] <arryana> it would have been, if i had not had older friends who were beyond decent.
[14:33:53] <arryana> it was a good education, if a rather rough one
[14:34:18] <arryana> i was never smart enough to learn the easy way anyway
[14:34:52] * arryana giggles at a memory which illustrates this
[14:35:42] <arryana> when i was 13, we moved into a house which had electric burners on the stove, which i'd never seen.  so after turning it on and off a few times to see how long it took to turn red, i put my fingers on it and then turned it on, confident (completely wrongly) that i'd have time to pull my fingers off before it got hot.
[14:35:59] <arryana> in hindsight, i should have used something like a candle with a low melting point instead.
[14:36:55] <bittersweetsymph> Yeah that is learning the hard way, we all have a few of those lessons, ouch
[14:36:56] <arryana> but not being very bright, i was in my thirties before second thoughts of 'what would be a less hazardous tool for this experiment' occurred to me.

[14:43:24] <mannequin> none of my poems re humurous

[14:44:12] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: never tested my IQ. But I sure did love computers and hated middle school
[14:44:33] <bittersweetsymph> arryana: you seem very bright but even very bright people do their share of dumb stuff I think
[14:44:37] <amigojapan> mannequin: hmm then maybe I misunderstood it
[14:45:05] <arryana> haha, i process information quickly, but that's about it.  it took a lot of years before i had a framework where that was useful.  i appreciate the vote of confidence, though
[14:45:09] <arryana> old age has been good to me.
[14:45:54] <arryana> a few of the decisions i made in my younger years turned out to be fairly solid, and i'm grateful for that
[14:46:26] <arryana> i've already turned down $250k for my truck, and god knows what my airstream is worth
[14:46:45] <arryana> if i hadn't lived in a car, i wouldn't have either
[14:47:37] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: I have the knack for learning languages too I guess. Somehow I think I would do poorly at an IQ test
[14:49:50] <bittersweetsymph> How many languages do you know amigojapan
[14:50:04] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: 3 fluently
[14:50:26] <bittersweetsymph> I learnt Japanese as well for a while but since I don't use it I mostly forget.
[14:50:41] <amigojapan> Ouch
[14:50:44] <bittersweetsymph> English, Japanese and Spanish?
[14:50:54] <amigojapan> Yes
[14:51:26] <bittersweetsymph> Be good to learn Spanish
[14:51:44] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: I can kind of tell what people are saying in Italian and Portuguese. Cause of their similarity to Spanish
[14:51:54] <bittersweetsymph> Did you know Japanese well before you went there?
[14:52:56] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: I studied Japanese for over 5 years before I came to Japan. I could already hold a conversation when I first came

[14:57:11] <bittersweetsymph> I want to go to Japan. All the Japanese restaurants here are so clean and organised and they are so polite. I don't know if all of Japan they are like that, but it sounds nice, the Cherry Bloosoms, hot springs and countryside looks beautiful.
[14:57:16] <arryana> mine's today.
[14:57:33] * arryana raises a glass to bittersweetsymph's arm
[14:57:48] <bittersweetsymph> That is good arryana
[14:57:53] <bittersweetsymph> Pfizer?
[14:58:01] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: but the borders have been closed to tourism for a long time
[14:58:10] <arryana> no idea
[14:58:20] <bittersweetsymph> It is a walk in, so unless everyone has the same ideas as me I should hopefully get in.
[14:58:24] <arryana> my first two were moderna, so i'm not really worried about whichever i get
[14:58:47] <arryana> i'm curious to see how bad the fallout is.  i had almost no issue after the first shot, but i slept the better part of thirty hours after the second
[14:58:51] <bittersweetsymph> Yeah I think they are pretty comparable in efficiency.
[14:59:21] <bittersweetsymph> Yes I hope I do not feel unwell afterwards
[14:59:33] <amigojapan> I think you are supposed to get the same kind of short as you got before
[14:59:44] <arryana> eh, i'm okay with it.  a day and a half of sleep is a hell of a lot better than the alternative

[15:01:10] <bittersweetsymph> True, worth it, what convinces me to get it ASAP is I really don't want to get Covid and spread it to someone I know/love. That would be just terrible.
[15:01:20] <arryana> that's a very responsible view.
[15:01:26] <bittersweetsymph> Or anyone else either.

[15:02:33] <bittersweetsymph> Yeah the heart problems might be a risk factor with covid-19
[15:02:44] <arryana> so they say
[15:02:46] * arryana shrugs
[15:03:05] <bittersweetsymph> amigojapan: I will get the same one I think Pfizer
[15:03:07] <arryana> i'm not overly fussed on my own behalf.  in my family, we're really hard to kill.
[15:03:17] <bittersweetsymph> Well we are lucky there is a vaccine.
[15:03:21] <amigojapan> bittersweetsymph: I also got Pfizer
[15:03:26] <arryana> my mother has been in hospice care for three years.  they gave her four months back then.
[15:03:28] <arryana> she's still going.
[15:03:53] <arryana> since that day she's broken her spine twice, two ribs, her wrist, and her jaw
[15:03:57] <arryana> yet, she pushes on.
[15:04:36] <bittersweetsymph> Oh gees hard time for her
[15:04:53] <arryana> she probably has the same blood disorder as well, it's just not easy to diagnose, and with so much wrong iwth her, there's sort of no point
[15:04:55] <bittersweetsymph> Yes I understand why you also want to get vaccined ASAP
[15:05:04] <arryana> there's not a great deal of treatment for porphyria that she doesn't already get anyway
[15:05:07] <bittersweetsymph> What blood disorder?
[15:05:12] <arryana> porphyria

[15:09:20] <bittersweetsymph> Sounds pretty serious
[15:09:43] <arryana> eh, it's inconvenient from time to time
[15:09:44] <bittersweetsymph> Life long thing?
[15:09:47] * arryana nods
[15:10:04] <arryana> the biggest problem is sunlight, and once i found out about it, that was easier to deal with
[15:10:24] <bittersweetsymph> That would be tough
[15:10:30] <arryana> eh
[15:10:38] <bittersweetsymph> The pain bit
[15:10:44] <arryana> oh, pain's just a fact of life.
[15:10:49] <arryana> you should see my ankles.
[15:10:50] <bittersweetsymph> But you get some periods it goes away?
[15:10:51] * arryana giggles
[15:10:59] <arryana> sometimes it's better than others, yep

[15:12:07] <arryana> i doubt very much i'll bother to have it removed this time.
[15:12:47] <arryana> i've got all sorts of extra bits, and missing bits.  none of it really makes much of a difference.  it's amazing what the human body can tolerate.

[15:14:36] * arryana giggles
[15:14:50] <bittersweetsymph> Oh fell over?
[15:14:52] <arryana> the right leg was crushed in an accident when i was 16.  the other was... three years ago?
[15:14:54] <arryana> four?
[15:15:08] <bittersweetsymph> Oh dear, can you still walk at all?
[15:15:10] <arryana> in the first case, i was just a passenger.  in the second, it was just a freak thing
[15:15:13] <arryana> yep, i don't even limo.
[15:15:15] <arryana> limp
[15:15:23] <arryana> like i said, i heal like a terminator.
[15:15:26] <bittersweetsymph> That is good then
[15:15:47] <arryana> and i'm annoyingly dedicated, i still do more than an hour a day of physio sorts of exercises to keep it all from locking up
[15:16:00] <arryana> i lost all the ligaments when the bones went, and they never heal quite right
[15:16:12] <arryana> but if you didn't know, you'd never know, bar the scarring
[15:17:06] <arryana> things like that aren't all mind over matter, but a significant amount of effort put in does make a difference
[15:17:25] <arryana> same way athletes heal from stuff that'd level anyone else.  they just work harder on recovery.
[15:17:35] <bittersweetsymph> That is good, good you were determined to get back moving
[15:18:02] <arryana> hell yeah.  it doesn't get easier as you get older, giving up is a non-option
[15:18:41] <arryana> for better or worse, there are people counting on me.
[15:18:45] <bittersweetsymph> I admire that l, hopefully if anything similar happens to me I can also rehabilitate
[15:19:01] <arryana> you'd do fine. most people think, 'i could never..', but they do if they have to.
[15:19:08] <bittersweetsymph> So much better for you health to keep active
[15:19:26] <arryana> there will be a day i won't be able to be useful.  but it isn't yet.
[15:20:18] <arryana> in a lot of ways it streamlines my life.  knowing for sure how short time is, i rarely waste it on anything trite.  it's much of the reason i use /ignore so much
[15:20:46] <arryana> i come here to chat with the people i enjoy, i see absolutely no reason i should be held hostage to attention seeking behavior of people who add nothing to my life.
[15:21:46] <arryana> and if anyone is so dysfunctional that a total stranger being indifferent to their words fucks them up so much, they have much bigger problems than me.
[15:23:01] <arryana> on the off chance one of them says something profound and i've missed it... well... i can live with that.
[15:24:02] <bittersweetsymph> Yeah, sometimes might be better to just /ignore
[15:24:12] <arryana> it's a brilliant command.
[15:24:30] <arryana> nobody is entitled to force anyone else to listen to them.

[15:24:56] <arryana> that's why god made psychiatry
[15:25:30] <arryana> metaphorically speaking, that is. i have no dog in the fight of whether there's a god, though i haven't personally met the fellow.
[15:25:58] <bittersweetsymph> Then someone ignores too  many and ends up ...why isn't snyone talking? Hehe
[15:26:24] <arryana> my guess is that if there is a god, which i doubt, whatever that being is would be so remote and so busy that our tiny lives would be atoms, billions of miles away
[15:26:29] <arryana> and so, irrelevent
[15:26:32] <bittersweetsymph> But generally yeah it has its place
[15:26:34] <arryana> eh, i don't mind quiet
[15:26:46] <arryana> i'd rather sit with no text than see a bunch of idiocy, any day
[15:27:03] <bittersweetsymph> Hmm who knows if there is a God

[15:27:53] <arryana> the only god i've ever seen any evidence of which i consider at all convincing is pele, the lava goddess
[15:28:10] <arryana> and i have no particular opinion on the matter beyond, 'huh, that was a hell of a thing'
[15:28:17] <arryana> but i'm a simple creature
[15:29:24] <arryana> in some ways i find it more interesting when someone i like is engaging with someone i can't see, as it's an exercise in listening to who they are and what they say in return to invisible text.

[15:30:21] <arryana> yep
[15:30:50] <arryana> i've spent time in hawaii on three occasions, two islands.  and on the big island there's some stuff that's rather amazing.
[15:30:53] <bittersweetsymph> What evidence of this goddess did you see?
[15:31:27] <bittersweetsymph> I would like to see the volcanos there. Went to Hawaii but never saw the volcanos
[15:31:27] <arryana> there's a place where pele was worshipped, it's a lava rock wall maybe shoulder high on me, give or take the size of half a football field.
[15:31:57] <arryana> at some point, lava came down from miles away, split around this rock wall area, and then re-converged to go two more miles to the sea
[15:32:02] <arryana> it was the only thing left untouched.
[15:32:29] <arryana> i have no conjecture as to the how, or even the why
[15:32:29] <pussipupu> ahem
[15:32:30] <bittersweetsymph> Wow, it would be good to see one day

[15:34:07] <arryana> given her age, i'm loving it, chaos though it creates
[15:34:24] <arryana> yeah, the elementals appeal to me a lot more than a sky-father
[15:35:06] <arryana> animism at least carries the responisibility of recognizing the right everything else has to... be whatever it is
[15:36:49] <arryana> aren't the sami animistic/shamanistic?

[15:36:56] <pussipupu> I guess some traditional gods uncontroversially exist

[15:37:07] <arryana> good example.
[15:37:16] <arryana> and through history, and across geography
[15:37:48] <pussipupu> yeah, and there are of course still practicing Sami shamens
[15:38:50] <arryana> i would love to observe that

[19:50:40] <audrey> to respond to a long-dormant conversation from last afternoon - at least in the last few centuries of history, there seems to be a fairly established pattern that the more educated and wealthy a woman is, the fewer children she has
[19:51:35] <audrey> Back in the Victorian era women could procure abortions more easily/less dangerously if they were wealthy. (The TS Eliot poem comes to mind - The Wasteland I think? which talks about this phenomenon)
[19:52:12] <audrey> This certainly holds up to 21st century data on women' s education vs. reproductive rates, by country
