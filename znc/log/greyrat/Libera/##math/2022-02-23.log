[00:57:35] *** Joins: Batzy (~quassel@user/batzy)
[00:58:16] <nomagno> An algebraic number may be expressed as ROOT(DEGREE, SIGN, (X/Y)), where SIGN is plus or minus, and X and Y are natural numbers
[00:58:23] <nomagno> The degree of a square root is two
[00:58:55] <nomagno> Do you need all positive integer degrees to represent all algebraic numbers?
[00:58:59] <Z-module> Root in what sense?
[00:59:21] <nomagno> Z-module: In the sense of square root.
[01:00:07] <Z-module> I hope you know that the five complex roots of x^5 - x + 1, which are all algebraic by definition, have *no* expression in terms of rationals and kth roots.
[01:00:11] <nomagno> the nth root of a number X is that number which you elevate to n to achieve X

[01:02:21] <Z-module> On the other hand, the set of all complex numbers you get by finite applications of kth roots (various natural numbers k), starting with Q, *do* form a subfield of \bar{Q}.  Sometimes called the radical numbers.
[01:03:07] <Z-module> there are also algebraic real numbers taht are not radical numbers
[01:03:54] <nomagno> Well, I'd greatly appreciate examples
[01:04:06] <Z-module> x^5 - x + 1   has one such root
[01:04:28] <nomagno> Hm... Yes.
[01:05:09] <Z-module> x^5 - x + 1 is, to me, the "simplest" polynomial in Q[x] having no radical roots in C

[01:42:17] <Z-module> JordiGH:  goes like this: The chain starting with 2 hits the non-prime 95 quickly. So now assume p is an odd prime. Recursively define  s_1 = p,   s_2 = 2p + 1 = 2^1 p + 2^1 - 1,   s_3 = 2s_2 + 1 = 2^2 p + 2^2 - 1,  ...,  s_n = 2^(n-1) p + 2^(n-1) - 1 for each n > 1.  But now notice that p divides s_p = 2^(p-1) p + [2^(p-1) - 1]   because it divides the term in square brackets, because of FLT.

[04:11:30] <ski> well, if ⌜A⌝ and ⌜B⌝ are theorems of the theory, then they're satisfied in all structures/models which satisfies the theory axioms. so it's probably more interesting to consider some weaker theory, perhaps dropping all the theory axioms (keeping the operations and laws/relations (function symbols and predicate symbols))

[10:20:08] <brownorange> theory means the statement is true or provable in the formal system.

[10:20:28] <int-e> you already have prov() for provability

[10:21:31] <int-e> brownorange: truth is the thing you keep mixing into these considerations and it just doesn't belong. Truth requires a model. If you have a model, the system is consistent.
[10:22:17] <brownorange> int-e if i say one of my axioms is something, but i have insufficient inference power in the system, there is a sense in which truths of my system belong to it but just arne't provable

[10:25:31] <ski> if you're just talking about the deduction system, then you probably shouldn't talk about "true" or "false" (except using those as constant formula. but you shouldn't be using those as adjectives to describe formulae). you should talk about what's provable/derivable
[10:25:41] <int-e> It's fun stuff.
[10:26:25] <brownorange> yeah i'm measuring semantic and syntactic consistency, it would be weird to have one but not the other
[10:27:09] <int-e> But that's more of a distraction. You don't need a model to talk about incompleteness, you can express it solely in terms of provability: A formal system is complete if for every sentence, that sentence is provable, or its negation is provable.

[10:29:09] <int-e> (The confusion about "completeness" is real though. Gödel's incompleteness is quite different from the incompleteness of second order logic; the latter is a failure of the analog of Gödel's completeness theorem for second order logic.)

[18:21:27] <isekaijin> Let A be a commutative ring, and let B be the ring of formal A-linear combinations of monomials in countably many variables x1, x2, x3... such that, if we set cofinitely many xi = 0, then we get a polynomial in the remaining variables. Notice that B is larger than the polynomial ring A[x1, x2, x3, ...].
[18:21:33] <isekaijin> Is there a name for B in the literature?
[18:22:18] <Z-module> Finite combinations?
[18:22:55] <Z-module> oh, I guess not
[18:23:25] <Z-module> So I think this must be a subring of  A[[x1, x2, ...]]  ?
[18:24:24] <isekaijin> I'm not even sure how A[[x1, x2, x3, ...]] is defined, but if the homogeneous parts of an element of A[[x1, x2, x3, ...]] are required to be polynomials, then B isn't a subset of this.
[18:24:32] <isekaijin> Notice that x1 + x2 + x3 + ... is an element of B.
[18:25:07] <isekaijin> (Because, if we “turn off” cofinitely many variables, then we just get the sum of the finitely many remaining ones.)

[18:33:42] <isekaijin> I have another description of B. Let X = {x1, x2, x3, ...}. We consider infinite tuples of polynomials (f_S), where the index S is a finite subset of X, and f_S \in A[S]. A tuple is said to be “compatible” if, for any S \subset T, then we can recover f_S from f_T by setting all variables in T \setminus S to 0. Then B is the ring of compatible tuples.
[18:34:05] <isekaijin> In particular, B is some kind of inverse limit.
[18:34:58] <river> it's like p-adic but with X?

[19:20:50] <isekaijin> First, we define an almost complex structure on M as an endomorphism J : TM -> TM such that J^2 = -1. (This implies that TM has even-dimensional fibers, and thus M has even dimension.) Every complex manifold has an obvious almost complex structure on its underlying smooth manifold. But not every almost complex manifold is complex.
[19:22:40] <isekaijin> Second, when does an almost complex structure J come from a complex one? Well, using J and the Lie bracket, we define the so-called “Nijenhuis tensor” N_J, and the super-hard-to-prove Newlander-Nirenberg theorem states that that J comes from a complex structure if and only if N_J = 0.

[21:27:56] <Z-module> cadmio: s is algebraic over that  K = Q(a_0,...,a_(n-1))  because it's a root of a poly with coefficients in that field -- the coefficients are in fact a_0, ..., a_(n-1)  themselves.

[22:49:16] <bildramer> is there a neat geometric proof?

[22:55:10] <gohlzehn> can someone tell how I can simplify (2x-3)/(6x+9) to (x-1)/(x+3)? I don't see it...
[22:56:07] <river> i dont think you can
[22:56:18] <river> (2x-3)/(6x+9) = (2x-3)/(3(2x+3))
[22:56:43] <river> you can pull uot that factor of 3 but not much beyond that
[22:56:49] <gohlzehn> mh then what about (x^2+2x-3)/(x^2+6x+9)?
[22:57:18] <river> ? (x^2+2*x-3)/(x^2+6*x+9)
[22:57:20] <river> %1 = (x - 1)/(x + 3)
[22:57:23] <river> calculator says that one works out
[22:57:28] <gohlzehn> oh wait, I already see my mistake here.
[22:57:49] <gohlzehn> So the question was the latter one, but I thought x^2 cancelled each other out on the top and bottom, but I can't do that of course.
[22:57:53] <gohlzehn> So that explains my mistake.
[22:57:53] <river> top is (x-1)(x+3) bottom is (x+3)^2

[23:23:44] <gohlzehn> I got this question today: "if 3ln(Y) = x^3 + ln(8), then y equals?" and the answer apparently is 2e^(1/3x^3), but how do I calculate this? I personally would have just start by diving by 3, following putting both sides as an exponent of 'e', but that gives me: e^((x^3+ln(8))/3) which is not that answer...
[23:26:39] <river> 3ln(Y) = x^3 + ln(8)
[23:26:47] <river> ln(Y) = (x^3 + ln(8))/3
[23:26:53] <river> Y = e^((x^3 + ln(8))/3)
[23:27:01] <JordiGH> Make log log again.
[23:27:11] <river> Y = e^(x^3/3 + ln(8)/3)
[23:27:18] <JordiGH> How do you even pronounce ln.
[23:27:19] <river> Y = e^(x^3/3)e^(ln(8)/3)
[23:27:21] <JordiGH> Is it two syllables?
[23:27:24] <JordiGH> So wasteful.

However, I just looked up fractions inside exponents because I haven't had lots of those problems yet, but 8(1/3) is basically: "what number to the power of 3 is 8?" but if it's a random number n^(1/8) does that mean I have to find a number which to the power of 8 would equal n?

[23:55:19] <Cale> One thing that really bothers me about the way they usually teach these things in highschool is that the question of whether numbers even have a square/cube/nth root is something that is sort of glossed over. The cube root of 8 is fine, but there's very little you can appeal to in order to show that there is a real number which is exactly a square root of 2 for instance, until you get to introducing something like the
[23:55:19] <Cale> least upper bound property, or limits, or something else usually reserved for later.
[23:57:16] <greenbagels> Cale: i just hate how the root thing is just taught so ad-hoc
[23:57:20] <greenbagels> maybe we have the same complaint
[23:57:47] <greenbagels> but it just feels like the foundational education of what real roots exist is just very "you'll know it when you'll see it" thing

[23:59:55] <Cale> They tend not to really say much about what sets the real numbers apart from the rational numbers, apart from the infinite decimal expansions thing -- which is all well and good, apart from the fact that it's terribly difficult to use infinite decimal expansions to show that a square root of 2 exists.
