[00:25:06] <Bco1981> i was, but then i realized. crunchyroll and funimation isn't doing it. it's just they only get the censored tv airing versions. that's more suitable for young teenagers too.
[00:25:25] <pokhu> nononono
[00:25:31] <Bco1981> yes yes yes
[00:25:33] <pokhu> i didnt mean why people started censorying

[04:18:18] <Fenderbassist> greetings amigojapan 
[04:18:41] <amigojapan> hi Fenderbassist
[04:18:52] <amigojapan> good morning pokhu
[04:19:59] <amigojapan> pokhu: Fenderbassist; last night I wrote a small sample programa that should execute both on android and iOS, I wrote it on my android phone using react native (using a keyboard)
[04:20:15] <pokhu> i see
[04:20:32] <Fenderbassist> cool
[04:20:35] <Fenderbassist> a good start
[04:20:40] <amigojapan> ty
[04:20:54] <amigojapan> smartphones are computers after all
[04:21:04] <amigojapan> you should be able to code on them
[04:21:04] <pokhu> makes sense
[04:22:09] <amigojapan> pokhu: do you use an android or iOS device?
[04:22:46] <pokhu> i have an android smartphone
[04:22:51] <pokhu> but i dont want to download anything on it
[04:22:55] <pokhu> because thats a headache
[04:23:03] <amigojapan> alright
[04:23:41] <amigojapan> you do need to install a runtime before you can run my program
[04:26:58] <amigojapan> actually it should run on PC too, but it is boring for a PC program, just a program that aasks your name, and then greets you
[04:27:14] <pokhu> ah ok
[04:28:08] <Nanobot> You've been captured by the enemy babes and thrown into a prison cell. The hot guard says you can't leave until you promise to kiss her. However, it would be her first kiss, so she might not be very good at kissing. The only things in the prison cell are a bed, a toilet, a spool of wire, a knife, a loaded handgun, several boxes of ammunition, a detailed map of the base, and the key to the cell. The guard is armed with a dildo. What do you do?
[04:28:54] <pokhu> kiss the guard
[04:28:56] <pokhu> ????
[04:29:01] <pokhu> i dont get it
[04:31:23] <Nanobot> You kiss the guard. It's the best kiss of your life. While she's distracted, you grab the dildo and stab it through her toe, killing her instantly. Leave the prison and find the rest of the guards are starting to leave for a pool party out of town. You have only a few minutes before they are all gone. What do you do?
[04:31:36] <pokhu> DONT KILLER HER
[04:31:36] <pokhu> WHAT
[04:31:57] <pokhu> tell the guards the truth
[04:32:03] <pokhu> and avoid killing them
[04:33:00] <Nanobot> You tell the guards the truth. They reach enlightenment. Their souls transcend reality, and their lifeless bodies fall to the ground. You leave the base, steal a motorcycle, and drive home. The end.
[04:33:25] <pokhu> no prison gf... fail
[04:35:54] <amigojapan> now that I can IRC, browse the web (withoght ads) watch youtube (withought ads) and even make programs (with a proper keyboard) I feel like my phone is a regular computer

[04:58:55] <MootPoot> I have an idea for some of these
[04:59:00] <MootPoot> but I haven't really done any of them
[04:59:23] <MootPoot> I went to an applied program - we built systems rather then spend a lot of time with core CS stuff

[04:59:58] <Satin> is it hard
[05:00:08] <MootPoot> not particularly, but its something I picked up on my own
[05:00:11] <Satin> ok
[05:00:24] <Satin> so i need to stop fucking myself over and give it 2-3 hours and get it done
[05:00:49] <MootPoot> its basically just a way to write out how complicated a program is / how long it takes to run based on how many outcomes it has
[05:01:39] <Satin> i see yeah
[05:01:42] <Satin> in the worst case scenario
[05:01:43] <Satin> hmmm
[05:01:43] <MootPoot> so a program that does X = X+1 forever  is much simpler in big O then a program that calculates prime numbers
[05:01:46] <MootPoot> its just that
[05:02:15] <MootPoot> again, I learned this on my own time - I spent my time building databases for applied projects in uni

[05:06:00] <MootPoot> failing under pressure and failing without pressure are completely different
[05:06:10] <ButterNoodle> failing is a way of life tho
[05:06:16] <MootPoot> the pressure of grades is probably actually hurting her learning 
[05:06:30] <ButterNoodle> failing under pressure could just be a fart
[05:06:30] <Satin> i've already withdrew from the same classes last semester
[05:06:46] <Satin> there was a valid reason there though since i didn't know how to deal with PTSD
[05:06:47] <ButterNoodle> or u could fail and shit down the back of ur pants
[05:06:53] <MootPoot> but anyway
[05:06:59] <MootPoot> that's why I help her
[05:07:01] <Satin> now, it's just, after woking for 5 weeks straight, last weekend was horrible
[05:07:02] <ButterNoodle> hi Satin
[05:07:06] <Satin> and it's the week right before midterms fml
[05:07:09] <Satin> weekend*
[05:07:14] <MootPoot> ALSO - I do it becuase I dont like how most other programmers explain things
[05:07:17] <Satin> rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[05:07:21] <ButterNoodle> damn
[05:07:24] <MootPoot> its like how the manpages explain things - it assumes you already know anything
[05:07:30] <ButterNoodle> sounds like me and psyc101
[05:07:30] <Satin> MootPoot: i do not go to class for my CS algorithims/datastructures class
[05:07:37] <MootPoot> satin requires monke explanations 
[05:07:41] <Satin> the professor has a chinese accent.
[05:07:48] <Satin> I cannot understand shit.
[05:07:52] <ButterNoodle> I dropped that class every time during my first time at college

[05:08:25] <ButterNoodle> in her cute lil pusi
[05:08:46] <Satin> I have nothing against him, but I seriously cannot follow what he's trying to say at all after 5 minutes of him
[05:08:55] <Satin> it's not even his accent, it's just his style of talking too
[05:09:05] <Satin> and i'm not the only one, i know other people that took that previously lol
[05:09:08] <ButterNoodle> all I got out of that is "you see here"
[05:09:15] <Satin> on classmate said "i was just drooling the whole time"
[05:09:19] <Satin> one*
[05:09:29] <MootPoot> recording too quiet
[05:09:30] <MootPoot> cant hear shite
[05:09:32] <Satin> so my approach this semester was skip lectures and read the textbook
[05:09:45] <Satin> maybe i should have put the speakers louder
[05:09:49] <MootPoot> anywya
[05:10:03] <MootPoot> 90% of all the datastructures can be explained within like
[05:10:06] <MootPoot> 1min each
[05:10:12] <ButterNoodle> ngl he is the asian college professor version of the white monkey types chinese use to come in and speak english real fast at corporate meetings to convince people to do regrettable shit

[05:10:41] <MootPoot> I hate how everyone has to make a long elaborate explanation for everything
[05:10:52] <MootPoot> you only need a 30 second primer for most things
[05:10:56] <Satin> I don't care about length, I care about clarrity >:T
[05:10:57] <MootPoot> then you can figure it out

[05:11:06] <Satin> this guy's slides are fucking unapproachable
[05:11:06] <MootPoot> lol
[05:11:13] <Satin> and his lectures are impossible to follow
[05:11:17] <Satin> what he's tyring to say
[05:11:27] <Satin> and my stupid ass should have aggressively read the textbook even though it's hard

[05:12:03] <MootPoot> lol
[05:12:33] <Satin> i'm p sure i flunked my physics test today
[05:13:04] <Satin> all because of mental booming last weekend when it mattered the most smh, after 5 weeks of working straight and not failing to keep up with assignments
[05:13:45] * Satin quietly rages at the fact she doesn't have a car to even have stress-venting drives anymore because of that drunk retard who crashed into her parked car on feb 6 at 1 am
[05:14:02] <Satin> >police report takes 2 weeks in this shitty corrupt town
[05:14:27] <Satin> only got finally towed by insurance company to repair place today, and they're telling me finally about rental option on thursday >:c
[05:14:48] <MootPoot> did they pay out money 
[05:14:50] <MootPoot> for a new car
[05:14:53] <Satin> no
[05:14:59] <Satin> they towed it to the body shop only today
[05:15:04] <Satin> can you believe that
[05:15:07] <Satin> this happened on feb 6
[05:15:20] <Satin> it took the police TOO FUCKING long to get thne report out after saying "4-5 business days"
[05:15:25] <Satin> and now it's march 1???????????????????????????
[05:15:35] <Satin> how the fuck is everyone so incompetent here
[05:15:46] <Satin> and i'm just stuck in limbo during that whole time
[05:16:00] <Satin> b/c my insurance is only liability, but in this case, the other driver was 1000000% at fault
[05:16:12] <Satin> so they're forced to deal with me
[05:16:21] <Satin> here's the police report description btw of the incident:

[05:17:39] <Satin> they'll have the body repair place estimate if my car is even remotely repairable or not now
[05:17:47] <Satin> and then we'll go from there regarding compensation or repair
[05:18:19] <MootPoot> My phone has fingerprints on it

[05:20:53] <Satin> fuck drunk drivers
[05:21:36] <Satin> i heard a "blimp" sound at 1 am while doing homework
[05:21:37] <MootPoot> I don't like fucking drunk people

[06:15:30] <whoami74> because of your question above
[06:18:27] <Nanobot> You're arrested by the virgin police. They say you've exceeded your allotted time as a virgin and must now get laid. They provide you with three women to choose from. One is 35 years old with an amazing body, one is 17 years old and really cute, and the other is 8 years old and is leaning back in a beach chair while wearing shades and smoking a cigar. You obviously choose the third one, because the other two are her bitches, so all three of you go home to 
[06:18:27] <Nanobot> her mansion and have a wild threesome while the 8-year-old watches and directs the scene.
[06:18:56] <ButterNoodle> damn
[06:19:06] <ButterNoodle> I'd quote that one but its too long
[06:19:07] <Nanobot> *all four of you
[06:19:07] <ButterNoodle> giggity
[06:19:49] <MootPoot> why not make the 35 year old adopt the 8 year old, and then you marry the 17 year old, so you have have a foursome with a wife and a oyakodon at the same time

[11:50:15] <Bco1981> it's only 6 years old, works fine.
[11:50:34] <Bco1981> it's just a bit limited on storage.
[11:50:44] <amigojapan> yeah, it is just a way the phone companies have found to sell more phones
[11:57:49] <Bco1981> well, even if i didn't get a newer phone. it wouldn't be the end of the use for this phone. just that app.
[11:58:03] <Bco1981> can still access my bank on pc.
[11:58:33] <Sapphirus> That's why I only get phones with custom firmware support.
[11:58:50] <Sapphirus> Keep them alive a lot longer that way
[11:59:03] <Bco1981> well there are guides to update this phone to newer android versions.
[11:59:06] <amigojapan> right
[11:59:11] <Sapphirus> and never pay full price for a cellphone, because they deprecate in value faster than a new car.
[11:59:23] <DPA> The whole banking apps, social media apps, and apps for websites in general, are just so unnecessary and limiting. They should just make their website responsive and add PWA support. They'd get something looking like a native app for free, and it'd work everywhere.
[11:59:23] <DPA> Also, proprietary authenticator (apps). Why the hell. hotp, totp, there are plenty generic authenticator apps implementing those, including from trustworthy sources such as google. (I assume people trust google if they use android).

[12:02:46] <beaky> nice i like linux
[12:03:10] <Terminus> my current phone is $200 and is not samsung. i hate samsung. google doesn't sell $200 and they definitely don't sell their phones anywhere in the world.
[12:03:30] <amigojapan> DPA: does it have google maps app?
[12:03:46] <DPA> It's a linux phone, not an android phone.

[12:04:09] <amigojapan> DPA: that is exactly the rason why linux phones are not popular
[12:04:42] <Terminus> next phone i buy will still be in the $200 to $350 range. the other benefit of buying cheap and more often is you can take advantage of refreshing to more modern tech every few years.
[12:04:44] <Sapphirus> Terminus, well they do here and you can get a good deal on them used.
[12:04:49] <amigojapan> lack killer apps
[12:04:55] <Bco1981> i wouldn't mind a linux phone, if it's easy to use. and less then 150mm in height.
[12:05:00] <Terminus> there is not here so it's pointless.
[12:05:08] <Sapphirus> Flagship SoCs tend to outperform mid-range chips for quite awhile
[12:05:20] <DPA> I suppose you could install something like anbox, and install the AOSP version, but it's not like there are no native map applications available on linux, and AOSP sucks.
[12:05:42] <Terminus> but i don't need flagship SoC. i need a phone that works well enough. brand new $200 fits the bill.
[12:05:43] <Sapphirus> Battery can still hold 2 days of standby time with 2+ hours of screen ontime
[12:05:54] <Sapphirus> And can sustain a full day, pretty easily.
[12:06:34] <amigojapan> DPA: but they did not go around the world in self driven cars to get pictures off everything
[12:06:37] <Terminus> my 2 year old $200 phone still feels brand new and has the same battery life. actually, more standby time. i can hit 3 days.
[12:06:57] <Sapphirus> Couple that with battery hygiene and you've got a high-end device that'll last you for cheap
[12:07:45] <amigojapan> I chose my Sharp aquos phone cause sharp offers battery replacements

[12:09:06] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: its nto a shame, its a ripp off
[12:09:15] <KatrinValerie> Depends on the person, if you are into electronics and DIY, it is usually not that hard to replace a phone battery
[12:09:25] <KatrinValerie> Unless everything is glued
[12:09:28] <Sapphirus> There are some advantages to the way phones are constructed now, but you're right.
[12:09:28] <DPA> *basically a giant USB-C dock
[12:09:41] <KatrinValerie> then you are truely fucked, because the screens are basically designed to break when you unglue them
[12:10:10] <Sapphirus> cons outweigh the pros and mobile devices I absolutely detest nowadays
[12:10:24] <KatrinValerie> There's a company that tries to do it better, FairPhone, but they removed the headphone jack so I am salty at them.
[12:10:28] <Sapphirus> But you need one to function in society 
[12:10:37] <KatrinValerie> Their phones can be opened and serviced with regular tools
[12:10:38] <Sapphirus> fairphone is also EU only afaik
[12:10:51] <KatrinValerie> Just good old phillips and torx I think
[12:11:17] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: Sharp phones still hve a headphone jack
[12:11:23] <Sapphirus> DPA, I couldn't sacrifice the power and flexibility of an actual desktop for something like that. :\
[12:11:28] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: I have not looked into it deeply yet, but they claim that they have a modular design, so it would be possible to replace the modem chip
[12:11:33] <amigojapan> and they offer battery replacement service

[12:12:20] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: probably but their main gig is TVs
[12:12:33] <Sapphirus> You'd be surprised at how little I miss the headphone jack with my Pixel 4 XL
[12:12:42] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: its a general electronics company
[12:12:48] <Sapphirus> A $10 USB-C dongle has a better DAC in it than any phone I've ever used
[12:13:26] <Sapphirus> Goes to show how much they cheapen out if a cheap dongle from Amazon can be better
[12:13:28] <DPA> Linux phones, such as the PinePhone, PinePhone Pro, and the Librem 5, are easy to disassemble & reassemble, and batteries are available. (Although the L5 may take years before you get it right now duo to an inavailability of the SoC, the PP Batteries are sold out (but the phone ships timely there), and batteries have odd shipping regulations in the EU, must be in some device to be legally shippable, I think).
[12:13:52] <Sapphirus> So I'm glad, because I can just get a dongle and upgrade it if I want to use better IEMs or cans with my phone
[12:14:22] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: You are right, it cannot be shipped outside of European countries, but it is not limited to the EU countries.

[12:15:01] <Sapphirus> Then it wouldn't be very practical for someone who doesn't live in the EU.
[12:15:15] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: linux phones lack vital applications
[12:15:24] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: there are ways to circumvent this problem, post relay services
[12:15:42] <Sapphirus> Too much of a hassle to be worth it. I'm not unhappy running custom firmware on Google phones.
[12:15:46] <KatrinValerie> You basically get things sent to a PO Box, they get relabled and sent to you via a third party
[12:16:29] <KatrinValerie> That's generally helpful when you are shopping for things you can't get where you live.
[12:16:49] <KatrinValerie> But you need to look up customs regulations and properly declare things yourself with these services!
[12:16:57] <Sapphirus> Those sound like such a hassle to bother with and it just turns me off.
[12:17:00] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie:but it can be caught by customs
[12:17:25] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: if it is correctly declared they will just send it too you when no fees apply
[12:17:41] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: you can declare upfront and pay the fee to avoid custom taking your package
[12:17:45] <Sapphirus> I've had Intel Engineering Samples shipped from Japan with stamps in an envelope without customs giving a crap

[12:18:22] <KatrinValerie> If your declaration is sound they usually have no reason to investigate further
[12:18:24] <Sapphirus> Japanese seller even lied about the value to skirt underneath Canadian tax import regulations
[12:18:47] <Sapphirus> easy to do I guess if you hide a couple of processors in an envelope
[12:18:51] <amigojapan> I see DPA
[12:19:09] <Sapphirus> I kept the envelope because of the Japanese stamps looked cool
[12:19:16] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: and despite regulations, it is not really problematic here to get prescription stuff from outside the EU, if you go through eg belgian customs
[12:19:55] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie:I am nto sending you prescription drugs
[12:20:01] <Sapphirus> There's one other thing I bought from Japan that I use on semi-regular basis that was properly declared.
[12:20:28] <KatrinValerie> uhm I did not ask for that amigojapan, I was just talking about the customs situation
[12:20:34] <Sapphirus> Bought it over a few years ago and it's handy for keyboard things

[12:21:26] <amigojapan> I see KatrinValerie
[12:22:07] <KatrinValerie> Trans healthcare is really bad here, when you move it's almost unavoidable to be cut off from your hormone prescriptions for a while :/
[12:22:24] <KatrinValerie> Unless you can afford to drive to your old doctor all the time

[12:24:15] <Sapphirus> amigojapa, how does Japan treat sexual minorities? I heard on the TT Podcast that Japan is quite a ways behind the west (and Taiwan, by the sounds of it).
[12:24:45] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I have no idea
[12:25:02] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I dont meet many sexual minorities here
[12:25:17] <KatrinValerie> Sapphirus: that is not a question anyone can answer really, because it will be different for different places and people.
[12:25:22] <amigojapan> at least not that have come out of the closset
[12:25:45] <KatrinValerie> I mean, how you get treated as a homosexual in Germany really heavily depends on where you live for example.

[12:32:25] <Sapphirus> Sounds about right to me. Religious right still hasn't figured out what love thy neighour means.

[12:32:50] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: tomako says its 2 choume
[12:34:43] <DPA> If I see people kiss each other, like, really almost eat each other, I tend to look away and think get a room. Especially if it's in public transport. But it doesn't really matter to me if they're gay or not. It's a bit gross either way.
[12:35:05] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, I'll remember that if I ever somehow can make it to Japan some day.
[12:35:38] <Sapphirus> DPA, I tend to agree with you there.
[12:35:45] <DPA> Worst thing is people kissing their dogs... I mean, just eww...
[12:36:02] <Sapphirus> That's possibly the worst thing or letting their dogs lick them.
[12:36:05] <Sapphirus> ugh
[12:36:38] <KatrinValerie> DPA: public transport is definitely not the right place to kiss
[12:36:50] <KatrinValerie> Also sounds like an easy way to really badly hurt your lips lol

[12:37:30] <KatrinValerie> I am talking about places where it is culturally appropriate to kiss
[12:37:37] <Sapphirus> Probably be a long time before people who're unvaccinated can freely travel most of the world.
[12:37:49] <Sapphirus> Local restrictions have all been removed with the exception of masking
[12:38:55] <Sapphirus> Then combine that with having the means to travel. :P

[12:45:19] <Sapphirus> depends on squatters rights are still upheld in your jurisdiction, i guess
[12:45:22] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: nah, its ok
[12:45:31] <Sapphirus> if you can get away with it long enough, you can claim it as yours, I suppose.
[12:45:38] <DPA> Every house comes with water and electricity. Combine the two, and it turns into a giant bomb. (2H2 + 2O2 => H2O + 2O). So technically, every house is a weapon. No need to buy additional ones.
[12:45:44] <amigojapan> I see Sapphirus
[12:46:02] <Sapphirus> I think they got rid of them here
[12:46:15] <amigojapan> I see
[12:46:30] <Sapphirus> actually no
[12:47:09] <Sapphirus> seems like a few conditions have to be met like uninterrupted use of the property for at least a decade

[15:06:47] <KatrinValerie> DPA: catholic dogma has it that the trinity is god, so god is made up of the holy spirit, jesus christ and I keep forgetting the third thing because I am not religious

[15:09:21] <amigojapan> O2B: that is one way to pronouce his name in english, yes
[15:09:26] <DPA> The insistance of those religions of there being only one god, and the disagreements about his teachings, have lead to major conflict. I think the greek had many gods, and also imported & integrated ones from other religions, which had the opposite effect, helping to unify & get along.

[15:44:05] <O2B> Men will be Men
[15:44:24] <KatrinValerie> There's been homophobia in culture for ages
[15:44:43] <KatrinValerie> It's been heavily spread by christianity
[15:45:52] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: the reason why it became seen as something gross, is that christian religion puts a duty to reproduce at the forefront of the purpose of life.
[15:45:59] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: thinking something is gross can be an instinct too
[15:46:09] <KatrinValerie> And the church did not want to allow such unions
[15:46:15] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: But it is not in this case
[15:46:44] <KatrinValerie> Many more complex emotional reactions are actually taught

[15:48:08] <KatrinValerie> Why do guys always view women as beings without a libido?
[15:48:09] <amigojapan> DPA: and if you are not gay, then you may find gay gross, I think thta is natural, but needs to be ocntrolled cause the gay people are not harmming you
[15:48:37] <KatrinValerie> Because of our culture
[15:49:06] <KatrinValerie> At least here we teach women that they have to cover up certain body parts, dress "modestly" etc
[15:49:48] <KatrinValerie> btw the dress code stuff from the bible is often misinterpreted as well, that's just saying don't flaunt your wealth with the stuff you are wearing and don't make a fool of yourself like these weirdos with the oversized hats from rome
[15:50:07] <KatrinValerie> The bible makes a lot more sense with historical context
[15:50:56] <amigojapan> I dont see a need to say "the bible really said this or that" since it does not affect my life directly
[15:51:44] <amigojapan> I let people have a different opinion from me
[15:53:25] <amigojapan> even if I wanted people to agree with me, i know there are going to be plenty of people out there that iwll never agree
[15:55:46] <DPA> I won't actively try to unequally treat gay people. But people won't miss when you're feeling unconftable. I don't think it's necessarely a problem, as long as everyone understands the others circumstnaces. But there are often prejustices on both side.
[15:57:31] <amigojapan> DPA: I dont really know many gay or  non straight people in real life tho

[16:19:18] <Bco1981> i'm on the computer... too much. but if i have to chose, i would have the bedroom be the AC room in the summer. But i don't have to chose so i directed fans around in my apartment last summer and had it nice in the livingroom and my bedroom.
[16:19:47] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: who needs a functioning laptop screen when you can plug it into an external monitor?
[16:19:56] <amigojapan> nice Bco1981
[16:20:02] <Bco1981> very
[16:20:13] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: both in this and my last apartment I couldn't physically get AC in the bedroom in summer
[16:20:17] <TsundereNoises> fucking stupid windows
[16:20:26] <TsundereNoises> so it's fan in the bedroom, put the computer in the room with AC
[16:20:51] <Bco1981> TsundereNoises: is there a balcony? 
[16:21:06] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: my laptop does not have an external video plug, and tomako does not wnat me to move the TV/monitor either
[16:21:34] <Bco1981> amigojapan: wut?... what laptop does not have hdmi out ?
[16:21:38] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises:but the smartphone does have the capacity to plug to the monitor
[16:21:47] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: well this place actually kind of sort of has a balcony, off the living room there's a door to a tiny little wood platform that always gets a giant wasp nest and lots of spiders
[16:21:59] <beaky> lots of kumo-chan
[16:22:01] <TsundereNoises> not near the bedroom though, and it sucks too much to use
[16:22:07] <amigojapan> Bco1981: an old one i was using
[16:22:13] <TsundereNoises> beaky: yes, you can see the clouds really well from there
[16:22:19] <amigojapan> Bco1981: it does not have VGA either
[16:22:26] <Bco1981> damn
[16:22:35] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: that's pretty funny
[16:22:44] <amigojapan> Bco1981: I think I will take the SSDout to restome thed data on my PC
[16:23:11] <TsundereNoises> I can't believe they make laptops with no video out at all
[16:23:33] <TsundereNoises> but I guess mac has been pushing this minimal ports bullshit for years at this point
[16:23:34] <Bco1981> even older laptops had svhs out
[16:23:46] <Bco1981> oh
[16:23:47] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises:oh, I just figure out Icould use one of my tablets as a second screen on my android phone, that sounds like a good idea too
[16:24:02] <Bco1981> macbook... that's a different story.
[16:24:12] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: I don't know if that's what he has or not
[16:24:22] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: just thinking that those fucking things influence the market
[16:25:08] <TsundereNoises> ports are so ugly, if you want an asthetic laptop just pray to the bluetooth gods and cross your fingers
[16:25:18] <TsundereNoises> sigh
[16:25:34] <Bco1981> what kind of people goes for looks only...
[16:26:25] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: so my keyboard right now kind of sucks, I was thinking I should get a new one, I was actually in civilization the other day with a real city with several electronics stores
[16:26:39] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: there was like non-wireless keyboard among them
[16:27:00] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: so I guess I'm ordering online, which I mean I was probably gonna do anyway but I was hoping for instant gratification
[16:27:05] <HubertFarnsworth> true TsundereNoises 
[16:27:59] <TsundereNoises> cords aren't that big a hassel, I'd so much rather not have to worry about battery life on a keyboard, I type a lot
[16:28:29] <TsundereNoises> I understand why SOME people might want a wireless keyboard, but I can't understand how they are apparently all anyone is selling
[16:28:58] <Bco1981> i bought a cheap lenovo gaming keyboard, it's actually not bad. compared to what i had.
[16:29:05] <DPA> All you need nowadays is a USB-C prot with DP-Alt mode support. Can charge, drive mouse, keyboard, screen, and any other device you can think of.
[16:29:09] <TsundereNoises> also I like to try to type on a keyboard before buying, see how it feels
[16:29:20] <Bco1981> LENOVO LEGION K300
[16:29:41] <Bco1981> it's a membrane keyboard, but almost feels like a mechanical
[16:29:42] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: I'm thinking I might try out one of those split hand ergonomic ones actually
[16:29:48] <Bco1981> ah
[16:29:52] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: I need the clickity clackity
[16:29:57] <Bco1981> lol
[16:30:14] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: but also, membrane keyboards seem like they'd be hell on my wrists
[16:31:22] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: so my main hobby other than watching vtubers, failing to study moonrunes, and forgetting to catch up on anime, is trying to write fiction, I type a lot
[16:31:26] <Bco1981> so split keyboard, and trackball mouse.
[16:31:34] <TsundereNoises> fuck trackballs man
[16:32:02] <Bco1981> lol
[16:32:03] <TsundereNoises> I did get a cheaper "gaming mouse" though
[16:32:18] <TsundereNoises> which is what you call anything that feels remotely good on your hand apparently
[16:32:24] <TsundereNoises> just now you put colored lcds in it
[16:32:50] <Bco1981> it has a display ?
[16:32:55] <TsundereNoises> it's got what I assume are supposed to be 3 snakes fucking on it
[16:33:06] <TsundereNoises> and the snakes glow pretty colors
[16:33:30] <DPA> I think "gaming" usually just means "has RGB lights".
[16:33:35] <TsundereNoises> it fits the real requirements of having a scroll wheel and feeling good on my hand
[16:34:04] <TsundereNoises> DPA: exactly, although as far as mice go, it seemed like it was either RGB light ones, or cheapo "comes free with the computer and feels like shit" mice

[16:57:45] <MootPoot> there are some
[16:57:48] <MootPoot> but like....
[16:57:58] <MootPoot> 5 of them, and they're in the center of the city

[16:59:03] <MootPoot> there is a bakery that opens at 7am which might do bagels if they feel like it
[16:59:03] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I'm not sure

[17:03:28] <MootPoot> its not that work hours are long which is the problem - its that they dont get enough people and schedule the shifts accordingly
[17:03:33] <TsundereNoises> also, food is really best when it's open both before and after everyone else is at work, so it makes sense to have 2 shifts for food business in general
[17:03:59] <TsundereNoises> or just specialize in one time of day

[17:41:34] <MootPoot> pickled green chilli is the best~
[17:41:52] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I'm really bad at picking an absolutely favorite thing
[17:41:58] <MootPoot> HubertFarnsworth: you know the green peppers in oil/pickled that you lot make
[17:42:02] <MootPoot> I love that shit
[17:42:14] <amigojapan> ok back to keyboard
[17:42:56] <HubertFarnsworth> nice, me too
[17:43:09] <HubertFarnsworth> I think americans also do that
[17:43:30] <MootPoot> the only thing that annoys me is that different companies have their spice mix completely differently 
[17:43:38] <MootPoot> so its hard to get exactly what you want
[17:43:54] <MootPoot> I love the spice
[17:44:13] <HubertFarnsworth> my mom makes her own spice
[17:44:27] <MootPoot> you make your own?
[17:44:36] <MootPoot> I just buy the plastic jars
[17:44:56] <MootPoot> dont you need some kind of special oil and spices to do it
[17:45:01] <MootPoot> and leave it for like a year
[17:45:16] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, some people like my mom are of opinion that outside stuff is bad and it's better to make their own
[17:45:24] <TsundereNoises> yeah, I don't buy pre-blended spices either, mixing your own is the way to go
[17:45:25] <HubertFarnsworth> and also they have recipe
[17:45:48] * MootPoot prepares to get lynched
[17:45:49] <TsundereNoises> and really it's better if you don't just use the same spice mix for everything, because the spices don't sit around as long
[17:46:07] <MootPoot> Somebody once gave me homemade pickled chilli peppers
[17:46:11] <MootPoot> but I liked the company one better
[17:46:12] <MootPoot> :3
[17:46:20] * MootPoot takes cover
[17:46:23] <TsundereNoises> even things that are more-or-less similar I tend to do slightly different spice-wise depending on what else is going with the meal
[17:46:43] <TsundereNoises> and that's easier to do when you're just combining the plain spices, instead of buying a blend
[17:47:10] <MootPoot> I have a half decent spice cupboard
[17:47:17] <TsundereNoises> but also, if I bought "cajun seasoning" and "italian seasoning" or whatever, they'd both sit around longer compared to how fast I go through thyme and oregano, for example
[17:47:22] <MootPoot> maybe like 12-15 things in there
[17:47:50] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: I occasionally use those as a base - so for meat I'll use a meat rub thing then just add whatever I want to adjust 
[17:48:14] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: yeah, but then you have to have the other stuff too
[17:48:24] <TsundereNoises> and yeah, meat rubs are a great example
[17:48:42] <TsundereNoises> like every meat rub ever is going to want pepper, for example, but you also use pepper on all kinds of other shit
[17:48:53] <MootPoot> Also - I dont really buy the complete mixes, more of the people who I live with really love taking crappy shortcuts while cooking
[17:49:04] <MootPoot> so I end up with those mixes
[17:49:17] <MootPoot> I HATE fucking pre-fried onions
[17:49:22] <MootPoot> and bottled garlic
[17:49:30] <TsundereNoises> I don't know how many spices I have, a fuck ton, but I only have like 3 blends, things people gave me I'm trying to use up
[17:49:36] <MootPoot> same
[17:49:40] <TsundereNoises> and I have 2 random little baggies of times I made too much of a blend for something
[17:49:52] <MootPoot> I have a meat rub bottle, and a seasoning salt bottle
[17:49:56] <MootPoot> mix*
[17:50:02] <MootPoot> that I'm trying to finish
[17:50:08] <TsundereNoises> yeah, most dry garlic sucks, and garlic is so easy
[17:50:32] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: I dont typically premix my own - the point of spices is keeping them fresh
[17:50:40] <MootPoot> so I just chuck whatever I want in the blade grinder
[17:50:44] <MootPoot> and instant fresh everytime
[17:51:14] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: dried garlic is one thing, but the specific one I'm talking about is those bottled pre-peeled garlic jars
[17:51:18] <MootPoot> still wet
[17:51:29] <TsundereNoises> yeah exactly
[17:51:31] <MootPoot> granted, they are convenient, but also they taste like fucking nothing
[17:51:35] <amigojapan> its interesting to see someone like MootPoot who always wants the newest electronics talk to someone like TsundereNoises who stays as analogue as possible
[17:51:39] <TsundereNoises> I don't buy anything pre-ground if I can help it
[17:51:54] <MootPoot> to prove a point I once ate a whole tablespoon of that garlic in one go
[17:51:54] <TsundereNoises> yeah I think people just suck at peeling garlic for some reason
[17:51:57] <MootPoot> it taste like nothing
[17:52:01] <MootPoot> actually nothing
[17:52:12] <mixfix41> i do like the mince garlic in the saurkraut size jars
[17:52:14] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I think that's just a dichotomy you made up in your own head amigojapan 
[17:52:21] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I mean, I eat a lot of raw garlic when I go to the garlic festival
[17:52:26] <TsundereNoises> damn it, it's been like 3 years at this point
[17:52:34] <TsundereNoises> but yeah, good garlic makes you cry
[17:52:45] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: I'm not sure if this is the best way - I'll jus tmicrowave it for like 15 seconds then crush with the flat side of a knife + then ez peel
[17:52:56] <amigojapan> MootPoot: do you even write by hand, or have a cellphone that can only do calls?
[17:53:02] <mixfix41> it doesnt taste too good but it goes with tangy sauces or fish sauce anyway
[17:53:35] <TsundereNoises> the stuff I need to use up is some tandori seasoning and phnom penh, because my mother-in-law knows we like indian food, but I already have all the components of anything I'd make
[17:53:39] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I do it when I need to?... I dont see what point you're trying to make
[17:53:49] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I mean I do that without the microwave
[17:54:05] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: honestly I usually just hit it with my fist instead of the knife for the first peel
[17:54:15] <TsundereNoises> HULK SMASH GARLIC
[17:54:18] <MootPoot> the microwave makes the outer peel get pushed out with the water evaporating due to the microwave
[17:54:24] <MootPoot> so it comes off super ez
[17:54:38] <TsundereNoises> sure, I don't doubt it
[17:54:42] <TsundereNoises> I just can't be bothered

[18:37:26] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: rub it into salt if something hard and flat if I REALLY need paste, but I can't recall the last time I actually needed garlic PASTE rather than just smashed garlic cloves
[18:38:01] <TsundereNoises> like I guess you'd want a good paste if you were doing garlic on toast, but I can't think of anything else
[18:38:16] <MootPoot> I use paste in marinades
[18:38:21] <TsundereNoises> for garlic bread I mince the garlic and melt butter around it and that's honestly as good and much easier anyway

[18:38:31] *** Joins: TheHermann (~TheHerman@gateway/tor-sasl/thehermann)
[18:38:42] <TsundereNoises> there's nothing about making an actual decent paste that's important to the marinade, just the garlic itself
[18:38:54] <TsundereNoises> I mean, you want some surface area on it, but you get that just smacking it around a bit
[18:38:57] <MootPoot> dosen't making paste = more garlic exposed = more flavour?
[18:39:02] <TsundereNoises> eh
[18:39:24] <TsundereNoises> I mean, technically that's true, but the difference between making a real paste and like smacking the garlic good is negligible
[18:39:29] <TsundereNoises> and it's much easier not to bother
[18:39:47] <MootPoot> lol
[18:39:58] <MootPoot> story of my life "and it's much easier not to bother"
[18:40:07] <TsundereNoises> also if you let the marinade sit any real length of time, you'll leach the oil out anyway, as long as you aren't just chucking whole cloves in
[18:40:20] <MootPoot> I guess I'll throw in chopped garlic
[18:40:22] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I love cooking, but I don't love putting more effort than needed into it
[18:40:28] <KatrinValerie> I only ever do that when I make curry paste
[18:40:39] <KatrinValerie> As garlic kinda holds everything together
[18:40:52] <KatrinValerie> And then I use a motar
[18:40:55] <TsundereNoises> when do you really need a curry paste though?
[18:41:06] <TsundereNoises> are you selling it?
[18:41:14] <TsundereNoises> or like for sammiches or something?
[18:41:15] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: whenever I prepare curry, which is as often as my girlfriend tolerates eating curry
[18:41:30] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: yeah, but you don't need to make a real paste to make curry is my point
[18:41:31] <TsundereNoises> I love curry
[18:41:48] <MootPoot> KatrinValerie: last time I used a mortar to make curry paste it was 1945 in a past life in the fields of france
[18:41:53] <TsundereNoises> you need the spices and garlic and onion and whatnot, but after it cooks a while, having made a true paste in the first place is... meh
[18:41:59] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: wtf
[18:42:20] <MootPoot> lol
[18:42:33] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: you are gravely mistaken!
[18:42:34] <MootPoot> wait, I got the date wrong
[18:42:44] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: I make great curry!
[18:42:46] <KatrinValerie> Only with the paste can the flavours truely expand throughout the entire curry
[18:42:47] <MootPoot> it was like 1942 or  41 - by 45 france was free again
[18:43:02] <TsundereNoises> but my garlic ginger paste is just microplaned ginger and smashed garlic
[18:43:04] <KatrinValerie> Mine is obviously better since you do not put the effort in to make the most awesome paste imagineable.
[18:43:45] <TsundereNoises> the important thing is we both season it ourselves, because commercial curry powder seasonings are ass
[18:44:33] <KatrinValerie> Well, they are okay with those foodbooth sausages and french fries
[18:44:52] <KatrinValerie> like with really fatty greasy food, that cheapo curry flavour just fits the mood of the food
[18:44:54] <KatrinValerie> if you get me
[18:45:04] <MootPoot> I remember one time I was out in the boonies at some kind of event my parents dragged me to
[18:45:18] <MootPoot> then a old guy there was about to butcher a goat for munchies later

[19:37:18] <Poeticode> I think municipal internet is the best solution for most places. There‚Äôs no financial incentive to lay fiber. :(
[19:38:13] <TsundereNoises> Poeticode: so you don't think local governments giving big ISP's tax breaks in order to set up their own privately owned shitty infastructure with a government-sponsored monopoly is the best?
[19:39:26] <Poeticode> Phew nobody actually wins in that outcome except the ISPs
[19:39:57] <TsundereNoises> careful, that's basically communism
[19:40:35] <MootPoot> afaik, from what I hear, the few places that municipal fiber works are exceptional cases
[19:40:40] <TsundereNoises> we love freedom here, that's why we like monopolies and regulatory capture so much
[19:40:55] <MootPoot> I remember listening to a podcast about it - its not easy to do even forgetting about the private corpos fucking it up
[19:41:00] <TsundereNoises> internet should just be a service, fund it with taxes
[19:41:04] <TsundereNoises> it's not about making back the investment
[19:41:42] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: taxes facilitate my supply of cute anime girls instead of exploding mud hut people? Sign me up
[19:41:59] <TsundereNoises> it would easily pay for itself here, comcast has a monopoly they basically just abuse to jack prices on shit service and lie about how much speed you get
[19:42:09] <TsundereNoises> you could get UP TO the speed you pay for, once in a blue moon, if you're lucky
[19:42:19] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: exactly
[19:42:42] <Poeticode> MootPoot I think the issue is more that places _with_ municipal internet in the first place are rare to find
[19:43:34] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: if you let me be in charge of our new government ISP, I can't promise I won't set it up to throttle het downloads at the expense of yuri though
[19:43:47] <TsundereNoises> TsundereNoises 2024!
