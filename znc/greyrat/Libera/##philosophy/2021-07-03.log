[16:04:22] <lalia> The resource suggestions as good or better than the body of the entry itself, IMO.
[16:04:45] <lalia> "are* as good"

[16:09:11] <arryana> up and down.  i found myself compelled to make banana bread because my other half can't follow the simple request, 'don't put anything on the refrigerator'
[16:11:00] <arryana> so, on one side, there's going to be banana bread shortly
[16:11:07] <arryana> on the other, there's about to be a domestic squabble.
[16:11:24] <lalia> My partner hadn't heard the "no food on the fridge" rule before, I discovered... when I found the bottom quarter of a bread loaf hard as a rock after it got left on top of the fridge for the day recently.
[16:11:31] <lalia> I was bemused to say the least. :D
[16:11:43] <arryana> i'm not quite 5'2.  i can't see or reach the top of the fridge.
[16:11:47] <arryana> this isn't a new request.
[16:12:05] <lalia> <3
[16:12:11] <arryana> i can't tell you how many times i've had an eyebrow split because something on top fell when the door was opened
[16:12:14] <arryana> a dozen, at least
[16:12:37] <arryana> he also has a penchant for putting smoke alarms up there, which then go off when i'm cooking, and i have to drag a chair over to retrieve it
[16:12:37] <lalia> It's amusing/annoying to find groceries in... shall we say unconventional places. :P
[16:12:55] <arryana> i'm generally very patient with him.  but i'm about to lose my shit on this topic.
[16:13:44] <arryana> his mother is a hoarder, and there is -no way- i will allow the 'i'm just putting this here out of sight for a minute, i'll move it i swear' bullshit to start
[16:14:20] <lalia> Can relate. <3 Hope it's a good understanding opportunity.
[16:14:24] <arryana> he gets defensive when i get annoyed, but i don't get why he -just doesn't stop putting shit where it doesn't belong-
[16:14:27] * arryana finishes venting
[16:14:59] <lalia> On the plus side: banana bread. :D
[16:15:15] <arryana> to be fair, it's usually less of an issue.  but i've been gone two months and the crap creep has overtaken
[16:15:24] <arryana> you know
[16:15:29] <arryana> maybe he just shouldn't get any
[16:15:49] <arryana> i wonder if that'd make it clear how at the end of my patience i am with that behavior
[16:15:56] <lalia> I would eat it in front of him to rub it in, fer sher. :'D
[16:16:05] <arryana> it isn't me that eats it, i'd give it to the dogs
[16:16:13] <lalia> Ha! Even better.

[16:16:30] <arryana> it's a thing i really don't understan
[16:16:51] <arryana> i learned young that you do -not- want to see what happens when you wear out the patience of a normally patient person
[16:16:59] <arryana> he clearly has not yet learned this lesson
[16:17:47] <lalia> Just imaginging it is a little cathartic while it's happening to you and not me. :P The dogs are enjoying a tasty snack... and it's your fault. :D
[16:17:57] <arryana> haha
[16:18:01] <arryana> well.
[16:19:33] <arryana> i'm going to have to find some dramatic way to make my point, or completely lose my marbles
[16:20:19] <amigojapan> Hi
[16:20:33] <lalia> Fer real tho, hopefully addressing it goes well. Am about to clean house for a while before the partner starts a catering gig that'll last the rest of today.
[16:20:41] <arryana> oooh
[16:20:43] <arryana> good luck
[16:20:47] <lalia> T
[16:20:50] <lalia> TY :3
[16:20:59] <lalia> amigojapan: greetings! :)

[16:22:18] <lalia> Multitasking. :) Just getting started on morning chores.
[16:22:29] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[16:23:16] <amigojapan> They say females are better at multitasking. I definitely find it hard to concentrate on more than one thing at a time
[16:25:59] *** Joins: frm (~frm@user/frm)
[16:26:07] <lalia> :) Not sure.
[16:26:32] <lalia> I'm trying to decide if I want to make pancakes or be less lazy and make like... actual breakfast.
[16:26:38] <arryana> haha
[16:26:51] <arryana> lord, more sexism
[16:27:11] <arryana> women aren't better at multitasking because it's demanded of them, not because they have inherent ability
[16:27:17] <joel135> kmh: thanks, i thought so too since falsity ≈ contradiction, and contradiction is violent, hence strong, yang
[16:27:58] <arryana> same as the fact that women aren't 'better at cleaning', it's just expected of them at a younger age
[16:28:33] <amigojapan> Alright arryana
[16:28:46] * arryana mumbles at the sexist nonsense
[16:30:10] <lalia> I have a friend in Oregon who's take on falsity is that everything is true, even false things. :) And TBH, his treatment of this stance pans out a lot more often than it might seem like it would. :P
[16:30:35] <amigojapan> But there are certain things that are different. At least on the phisical level
[16:31:10] <arryana> how so, lalia?
[16:31:12] <lalia> Difference is a matter of contrast between states or events and arguably has little or nothing to do with Truth.
[16:31:20] <arryana> hmm
[16:32:08] <amigojapan> lalia: I can say true statements about the differences tho
[16:32:20] <joel135> https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/ -- i think i am good for now but thanks for the reference
[16:32:21] <ro-bot-o> [url] Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) | plato.stanford.edu
[16:32:55] <arryana> can you give me a for-instance, lalia?
[16:32:58] <arryana> if you aren't too busy
[16:33:00] <joel135> (it doesn't mention any yin-yang business)
[16:33:32] <lalia> As a skeptic I live my daily life avoiding references to truth because I don't understand how it works and have no means for verifying. :) It's not hard to illustrate the flaws present in any particular truth-functional statement because the conditions for these claims always rely on assumptions made by the speaker.
[16:34:04] *** Quits: aototot (~teteetett@92.114.82.89) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[16:35:04] <lalia> joel135: Yeah, that's part of why I linked it: yin and yang aren't part of the frame of reference for philosophy unless you're willing to accept risking the use of racist tropes as an analogy. :d
[16:35:22] <lalia> Normally you'll find discussions about dialectics instead.
[16:35:36] <amigojapan> lalia: how about the systems"you and I are using computers"that is a true statements
[16:37:02] <lalia> arryana: my doubts about conventionally accepted truth stem from a lack of confidence in propositional knowledge. That is, I take it that knowledge based on statements like "i know x is true" can always be problematized and never hold in every case, though they're meant to. :)
[16:37:17] <joel135> Seems deliberately ignorant to avoid either truth or yin-yang.
[16:37:19] <arryana> i run into trouble when the word 'truth' starts diverging from 'fact'
[16:37:36] <lalia> I'm not saying I'm sure there's no such thing as truth based on this observation, just that I have no idea how it's supposed to work... even after a couple decades of looking at it. :P
[16:37:41] <arryana> to a christian, god is the 'truth'
[16:37:51] <joel135> What did you mean by dialectics instead?
[16:38:14] <lalia> joel135: do you have some trouble with ignorance then? seems to me that's sort of the state of life on this planet. :D
[16:38:29] <joel135> Willful ignorance.
[16:39:07] <joel135> That's more racist than misinterpreting yin-yang as a westerner.
[16:39:16] <lalia> I'm here to argue that there's very little difference between willful ignorance and any other sort. I'd call this issue a matter of prejudice rather than an actual problem.
[16:39:16] <joel135> Potentially more racist
[16:39:29] <joel135> Ok
[16:41:25] *** Quits: frm (~frm@user/frm) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[16:42:48] <lalia> joel135: maybe you have a text reference for your yin-yang interest? I legit have no idea why this imagery is coming up in this context ATM.
[16:43:09] <amigojapan> lalia: truth is just statements that relate to reality or even fiction in a way that is not against contradiction
[16:44:04] *** Joins: frm (~frm@user/frm)
[16:44:47] <lalia> I can't readily parse that. Seems like it'd depend on context and perspective in every case and even then... I bet it's arguable some contradictions are actually themselves somehow cases of truth.
[16:45:05] <lalia> Graham Priest has a few novel arguments in this direction.
[16:46:33] <lalia> Simply put: I've never managed to cultivate a sincere belief in any particular account of truth. Instead, I participate on the condition that I'm doing so blindly.
[16:46:40] <joel135> I started reading a little in daodejing a few years back but really my main sources on personally relevant philosophy are reflections by mathematician/logician/philosophers like Grothendieck/J.Y. Girard/Lawvere including a few sections in Recoltes et Semailles that are explicitly about yin-yang, and the formal definition of duality as 'adjunction' in category theory in mathematics
[16:47:34] <arryana> do you mean tao te ching?
[16:47:44] <joel135> Yep
[16:47:55] <arryana> clearly you're reading a version loose on spelling
[16:48:09] <amigojapan> lalia: give an example of a true contradiction
[16:48:12] <joel135> I don't care about how you romanize things
[16:48:20] <arryana> i wonder what else they were flexible with
[16:48:50] <joel135> Coming at things from my angle, the notion of 'truth' shouldn't be very surprising, even though I can agree that it is a problematic notion
[16:49:12] <lucky> pinyin transliteration is standard these days ?
[16:49:56] <lalia> amigojapan: Preist famously addresses a form of the so-called Liar Paradox. I'm not sure what we'd get out of debating this tho, if you're merely attempting to apprehend some truth when I'm attempting to question whether there is such a thing. :D
[16:50:20] <joel135> I would know if I knew chinese I gues
[16:51:35] <amigojapan> lalia: I have made a program that demonstrates the liars paradox to be a recursive sentence
[16:51:44] <amigojapan> I could show it
[16:51:55] <lalia> :| I don't think that's the idea.
[16:52:06] <amigojapan> Or just explain it
[16:52:13] <lalia> You've contextualized it and solved for a case.
[16:52:20] <lalia> That's... not how paradox works.
[16:52:34] <lucky> well, the daodejing is an extremely terse document and translation really does demand a certain amount of creative interpretation.  i don't normally say stuff is untranslateable but... :)
[16:52:35] <lalia> It's a formal problem
[16:52:44] <lucky> it's fascinating to see parallel takes on it into English
[16:53:05] <amigojapan> lalia: I am saying it is not really a paradox and I don't believe in true paradoxes
[16:53:42] * arryana decides doing something else would be more profitable and wanders off
[16:53:52] <amigojapan> lalia: the liars paradox deals with the sentence "I am now telling a lie"
[16:54:29] <lalia> Alright, I think we might be reaching an impasse here. I've got to get chores done and you're getting into discussion points I'm going to have trouble paying attention to this early in any case. :)
[16:54:56] <amigojapan> lalia: of the statement it true then it is a lie what it conveys. If it is false or is true what it conveys
[16:55:13] <amigojapan> Alright
[16:55:24] <lalia> I'll get into this with you later, since it's interesting. This problem is being mischaracterized RN on my view.
[16:55:26] <lalia> I'll explain.
[16:55:28] <lalia> But later.
[16:55:39] <amigojapan> Ok
[16:56:24] <joel135> lucky: interesting to hear
[16:57:30] <joel135> Thanks for now :)

[16:59:13] <amigojapan> One of the first principle I learned about philosophy was the law of non contradiction
[17:00:00] <amigojapan> I know there are philosophies that don't believe in it, but I think they are fringe
[17:00:50] <lucky> there are number of resolutions to the liar's paradox aren't there?
[17:02:02] <lucky> How's the recursive take go amigojapan ?
[17:02:51] <lucky> lie cannot be contextualized because "I am now" is indeterminately referenced until the reference is completed, but it can't be so around we go?
[17:04:40] <lalia> What do you think is achieved by offering a case-based solution to a formal problem like the Liar Paradox?
[17:04:57] <lalia> It seems like you think it's significant while I'm under the impression that it is not.
[17:05:01] <amigojapan> lucky:  p(true){return !true} maybe I did not mean recursive sorry
[17:05:02] <lucky> I have no idea
[17:05:22] <amigojapan> "According to Aristotle, first philosophy, or metaphysics, deals with ontology and first principles, of which the principle (or law) of non-contradiction is the firmest. ... According to Aristotle, the principle of non-contradiction is a principle of scientific inquiry, reasoning and communication that we cannot do without"

[17:06:07] <amigojapan> lalia: I don't believe in real paradoxes. But people can be considered by then yes
[17:07:03] <amigojapan> lucky: let me look in my gist
[17:07:18] <lalia> What you believe in might part of the thing I'm trying to question by asking whether truth is indeed itself a thing or not. :) Hence my suggesting we've reached something of an impasse.
[17:07:37] <lucky> You do understand the programming language you picked is an approximation of a formal logic system, probably one where this resolves as you've found
[17:09:55] <amigojapan> lucky: here is my python implementation https://gist.github.com/amigojapan/6de478bc582a9ba5433963d746cf1f5b
[17:09:56] <ro-bot-o> [url] liarsparadox.py · GitHub | gist.github.com
[17:10:24] <lucky> yes, type theory does the same: data Paradox = TrueStatement FalseStatement | FalseStatement TrueStatement
[17:10:53] <lucky> and you walk Paradox infinitely if you try to resolve it
[17:11:09] <amigojapan> lucky: so you are saying I am assuming the answer?
[17:11:24] <lucky> kinda, it's baked into Python (or Haskell or whatever)
[17:12:06] <amigojapan> lucky: you would say that about commuters in general
[17:12:35] <amigojapan> lucky: why did you ask for code then?
[17:12:44] <lucky> I was curious how you approached it :)
[17:12:52] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[17:14:40] <amigojapan> lucky: the closest thing I see to a paradox is people believing contradictory things. Which does happen. It happens in my mind too. But I guess the mind is not monolithic
[17:15:23] <lucky> how would you define a paradox?
[17:15:54] *** Joins: chomwitt (~Pitsikoko@athedsl-16082.home.otenet.gr)
[17:15:56] <lucky> if not that?
[17:16:32] <amigojapan> lucky: I have now confidence looking the definition up in a dictionary than defining it my self. One sec
[17:16:42] <amigojapan> lucky: oh
[17:17:02] <lucky> if it'll help, I'm thinking about the idea
[17:17:05] <amigojapan> lucky: cause there can be more than once person in one brain
[17:17:37] <amigojapan> One person*
[17:17:55] <lucky> Ah, to me a paradox, at least within logic, is more like when it forces two conclusions at the same time such that it ... just can't work.
[17:18:12] <lucky> And probably your theory is wrong
[17:18:41] <lucky> Approximately
[17:18:44] <amigojapan> lucky: which theory?
[17:18:57] <lucky> say a set of axioms about how something in math works
[17:19:06] <amigojapan> Ok
[17:19:07] <lucky> and you follow it through and through and it tells you 1 = 0
[17:19:10] <lucky> that's possibly a paradox
[17:20:04] <amigojapan> lucky: sure. Some things in maths are just fantasy. Like negative numbers

[17:20:08] <lalia> lucky: you appear to have an understanding of the context a lot more like what I've understood so far.
[17:20:18] <lalia> Thanks for commenting. :)
[17:20:25] <lalia> I appreciate the perspective.
[17:20:44] <lucky> it's a philosophical idea but it came from an engineer's perspective like mine, heh.
[17:20:50] <lucky> bits :D
[17:22:08] <lucky> I think it's fair to say that, for the kinds of set theory that are affected, a paradox exists.  Most people seem to accept that these days? (I'm no expert)
[17:22:22] <amigojapan> lucky: some parts of math are fiction. Like you may have a serene like "I love my beloved square circle"but it does not make it a reality
[17:22:36] <lucky> is any of math real?
[17:22:48] <lucky> That's a whole mess of another topic isn't it
[17:23:07] <amigojapan> lucky: negative numbers are fantasy. Show me -5 apples
[17:23:44] <amigojapan> Yes most of math is based on facts about objects.
[17:24:48] <amigojapan> lucky: I can show you another source code I made to define maths from nothing
[17:25:14] <lalia> I'm more of an intuitionism fan, I think.
[17:25:40] <amigojapan> lalia: intuition is often wrong
[17:26:00] <lalia> That isn't what the idea of intuitionism in mathematics is about.
[17:26:07] <lalia> https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism/
[17:26:08] <ro-bot-o> [url] Intuitionism in the Philosophy of Mathematics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) | plato.stanford.edu
[17:26:45] <amigojapan> I can demonstrate in code how to develop automatic from only counting
[17:27:08] <amigojapan> And counting is a property of objects
[17:27:12] <lucky> there's a set/type theory approach here too, if you're going all objects.  you have lists, which are either empty, or have n number of items identical except for sequence.  natural numbers are lists.  negative numbers are easily representable as list of lists, so yes perhaps they are less fundamental, but they're no less real than 2 is real compared to 1.  2 is a composite object of 1, after
[17:27:14] <lucky> all.
[17:27:48] <amigojapan> lucky: let me show you my code
[17:27:59] <lalia> I'm happy for your confidence. :) I'm honestly not here to convince you, I'm merely participating as a means for clarifying there are still questions and people like me are still not sure what the deal is in spite of your own assurances.
[17:28:14] <lalia> Seems like a pleasant outlook tho, especially if you find comfort in it.
[17:28:14] <lucky> I suppose that is what I should have come around to
[17:28:28] <lucky> all of these claims are valid/make sense within a handful of popular formal logic systems
[17:28:38] <lucky> the actual question is, are those right? :)
[17:28:56] <lucky> how would we know?
[17:29:05] <amigojapan> lucky: you need to look at the code to see how it works but I did not show myself to use any operator until I developed it first http://amigojapan.github.io/maths-from-scratch/
[17:29:07] * lucky exits the stage for lalia
[17:29:11] <lucky> have a good day :) i gotta get going

[17:29:29] <lalia> take care, lucky. :)
[17:29:46] <lalia> I should focus on getting stuff ready for our gig today too.
[17:29:51] <lalia> Long day.
[17:29:56] <amigojapan> Ok lucky have a nice day
[17:30:20] <amigojapan> You take care too lalia
[17:30:37] <lalia> yeah! nice chat. stay safe, amigojapan.
[17:30:53] <amigojapan> Thanks
[17:32:44] <amigojapan> I wish that user that I went over so many paradoxes was here. But he had not been here in a long time
[17:33:51] <Maxdamantus> I'd say a paradox particularly has to do with self-reference. Something that depends on itself having a particular truth value.
[17:34:53] <Maxdamantus> Disallow self-reference, and you don't have paradoxes.
[17:36:38] <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: yeah I had reviewed a number of "paradoxes"with what was his name js0z or singing like that. And he seemed to be good at finding what was wrong with every one
[17:38:24] <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: the moment I see a square circle. I will change my mind :)
[17:38:50] <amigojapan> I believe it is impossible to see a true square circle even in a dream
[17:39:17] <Maxdamantus> I'd say that's more of an oxymoron or something than a paradox.
[17:39:44] <amigojapan> Alright
[17:40:42] <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: at least many paradoxes have been solved over the years too
[17:42:13] <amigojapan> Things once believed to be paradoxes at least
[17:42:23] <Maxdamantus> Well, you don't really solve them. They're just things that arise in unsound logics.
[17:42:45] <amigojapan> Right
[17:44:56] <raincomplex> in my experience, paradoxes are about holding conflicting perspectives
[17:45:55] <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: does any philosopher explain why the law of contradiction exists and holds true?
[17:47:21] <arcturus> some of the contradictions are merely language tricks
[17:47:30] <arcturus> paradoxes, rather
[17:47:54] *** Quits: feliix42 (~felix@gibbs.uberspace.de) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
[17:51:10] <amigojapan> arcturus: there is probably also a bias in some people that want to believe "there is not such thing as truth or false"it may be a convenient tool for them
[17:51:53] *** Joins: feliix42 (~felix@gibbs.uberspace.de)
[17:51:56] <arcturus> its a question of definition
[17:52:46] <arcturus> true and false are clearly defined in math, and the concepts have been applied elsewhere, perhaps not entirely appropriately
[17:53:48] <amigojapan> Math is probably a bad example for most people.
[17:54:25] <Maxdamantus> amigojapan: dunno about philosophers, but one reason that seems kind of obvious to me is to be able to do proof by contradiction.
[17:55:04] <Maxdamantus> amigojapan: if you don't have the law of contradiction, then you can't prove that something is true by proving that it's not false.
[17:55:44] <amigojapan> I don't believe everything that girls m holds true in math has a physical EuroBasket equivalent. And are fictions. And in other kinds of fictions it is possible to mention false stuff as if it is true
[17:56:31] <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: thanks
[17:56:44] *** Joins: Treefingers (~Glassbox@103.162.189.80.dyn.plus.net)
[17:56:47] <Maxdamantus> and it might be too late atm to figure out how this works in other logics, but at least in things like intuitionistic type theory, if anything that is false is also true, you can prove anything else.
[17:57:48] <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: but that is a utilitarian reason. Not a reason why the law holds true in this universe to begin with. I think that is not known
[17:58:17] <Maxdamantus> amigojapan: well, logics should be utilitarian.
[17:58:32] <Maxdamantus> we use them to figure out facts about the world.
[17:58:56] <Maxdamantus> eg, proving that our plane software will not cause the plane to fall out of the sky.
[17:59:11] <amigojapan> I see. I guess I want a metaphisical of phisical answer
[17:59:45] <amigojapan> Yes Maxdamantus I agree with that part but it does but satisfy me
[18:01:12] <Maxdamantus> You can always make up some silly logics that let you derive silly things that don't correspond with reality, but that's not very interesting.
[18:02:13] <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: it's over thing to say "the universe behaves this way"and another to explain why it behaves the way it does
[18:02:35] <amigojapan> 10:32 PM <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: it's one thing to say "the universe behaves this way"and another to explain why it behaves the way it does
[18:03:24] <amigojapan> Maxdamantus: do you believe that is not knowable?
[18:04:12] <amigojapan> That would be an acceptable answer
[18:06:02] <Maxdamantus> Dunno, need to go to bed.
[18:13:34] <amigojapan> Good night Maxdamantus
