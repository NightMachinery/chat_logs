[04:53:52] <morganu> I have ubuntu 20.04LTS, What is the best simple install thelounge tutorial page?  Thanks
[04:54:14] <morganu> (Suggest that it be in the topic.)
[04:55:58] *** morganu is now known as morganu_
[05:05:41] <xnaas> the topic can definitely take you to https://thelounge.chat/docs/install-and-upgrade morganu_ if you have eyeballs 😉
[05:10:27] <NoxTurminal> Just realized on ff Android you can install thelounge to homescreen and it removes address bar and works like a perfect mobile app even push notifications

[22:52:17] <MaxLeiter> I thought browsers on android offered to install TL as an “app”. Is that something we should tell the user?

[23:30:00] <bookworm> It quite literally asks you with an install popup iirc, not sure you need to tell them much. Also it's not like TL is the only app that does this either
