[07:49:34] <feoh> There's an OTHER rss feed plugin that supports MDX. So I go install that. Out of date. So I try updating it, rebuild it, install that. Now Gatsby is dying with a Webpack error.
[07:49:52] <feoh> I now understand why people talk about feeling like they're drowning in the JS ecosystem. I miss my cozy Python :)

[07:55:10] <pushcx> You are indeed being tought Javascript.
[07:59:41] <vgel> Modern javascript development is 50% writing typescript, 50% figuring out how all the tools work and debugging their interactions, and oddly ~0% writing javascript
[08:01:34] <avu> feoh: right because the Python ecosystem is so simple and stable. What are you using these days, virtualenv or venv? pipenv or poetry? Or maybe pdm? And what about asyncio vs trio? Or are you stuck with twisted? (;
[08:08:40] <feoh> Why does everything have to be my thing rocks and your thing sucks? I'm having a tough go. That's all.
[08:09:24] <feoh> pushcx: HEH yes indeed :)
[08:10:01] <feoh> avu: I WANT to learn Javascript. it is eating the world so clearly there's something there. I am struggling with the tools, and I miss the familiarity of an ecosystem whose warts I am intimately familiar with, that' sall :)

[08:10:47] <avu> feoh: yeah, I totally get that, I said that more tongue in cheek
[08:10:54] <feoh> Gotcha!
[08:11:10] <feoh> Some people actually act like I'm tipping their sacred cow :)
[08:11:27] <avu> feoh: and I do think the whole ecosystem on the JS side is more complex and moving faster, I've switched from Python to JS a few years back but still come back to Python for private projects
[08:12:10] <avu> or, as vgel correctly pointed out, I mostly switched to 50% TS / 50% dealing with tooling ;)
[08:12:58] <feoh> heh yeah
[08:15:02] <feoh> pushcx: I seriously considered learning RoR but I feel like that's not seeing a ton of new adoption other than from developers already immersed in the ecosystem. I still love Ruby :) Blocks just make me happy :)
[08:16:13] <feoh> But I'm trying to move from a mostly "Devops" skill set to having the skills necessary to get hired as a mainline software developer. I may not switch specialties, but I want the skills to be ready should I ever care to, and I feel like in 2022 Javascript is pretty much de-rigeur.

[08:17:53] <avu> depends a bit on the field, there are still those where JS is largely irrelevant but it feels like it's getting less and less for sure
[08:18:05] <avu> even astronauts have used JS UIs in space :)
[08:18:12] <vgel> feoh I haven't used RoR personally, but I wouldn't write it off if you love ruby, i've definitely seen more interest in it recently and it's still popular with startups i think (tho JS is still an important skill don't get me wrong)
[08:19:17] <feoh> Right. Also SUPER hard to gauge this stuff, because it's almost impossible to use what you see in terms of discussion or buzz to correlate a given tech's market value/adoption.
[08:19:48] <feoh> Like, every JS/Ruby/Python devotee for the last 10 years has been beating the "java is dead" drum and it is anything but!
[08:20:21] <feoh> I know Java but do not particularly enjoy working in it on substantial projects
[08:22:19] <vgel> yeah, it's hard to gauge. personally I worked at a startup that used pure django then migrated to a react frontend + django backend (but did as little on the frontend as possible), then moved to a full stack typescript startup that had spent a ton of engineering effort to basically get a worse version of django IMO (though they did have a cool
[08:22:19] <vgel> event-sourcing framework the CTO wrote). the place I'm at now is rust + python (flask + comp bio stuff). but I definitely have a few friends that basically only do js and haven't had an issue finding work, also.
[08:22:22] <avu> I think certain languages have tug themselves trenches deep enough that they'll "never" truely die and Java is definitely one of them. I'd bet you'll still be able to easily earn a good salary with JEE in a few decades, just like you can with Cobol today
[08:23:34] <vgel> there's definitely some buried mainframe in a military base that will run java 1.5 for centuries after humanity is gone
[08:24:24] <vgel> also java is surprisingly popular with indie game devs -- minecraft of course, but also project zomboid, slay the spire, starbound, and definitely more I'm not thinking of
[08:28:26] <feoh> It's popular in all kinds of places, people just don't like to SEE that :)
[08:29:13] <avu> also, I think we programmers like to think it's dead or dying just because it's a very boring language :)

[15:00:28] <iDrougge> I didn't know there was an OS that didn't handle this.
[15:01:13] <iDrougge> But then I didn't know that Go layouted structs in the same way as in source code.
[15:01:58] <pe> Go is basically C, so why wouldn't it.
[15:02:12] <pe> I don't know of any language that would reorder fields.
[15:03:24] <iDrougge> I thought any modern language would. Does even C guarantee struct layout?
[15:03:30] <pe> Yes.
[15:04:31] <iDrougge> Rust doesn't make such guarantees, Swift doesn't. I suspect Zig does something stupid.
[15:06:28] <Foxboron> This seems like a minor nitpick on any language
[15:07:04] <pe> Rust doesn't have a specification, AFAIK.
[15:07:28] <rb> iDrougge: something stupid?
[15:07:39] <demize> C guarantees the order but not the exact layout since padding is implementation defined.

[15:08:34] <rb> uhhh that link
[15:08:54] <pe> It creates debugging hell.
[15:09:19] <iDrougge> In C land, in Go land or where?
[15:09:25] <pe> Anywhere.
[15:09:36] <rb> pe: well it depends on what you're doing more than anything
[15:09:46] <demize> Not if you have debug symbols.
[15:09:51] <rb> it makes sense to reorder for optimization in the general case
[15:10:23] <iDrougge> Debugging without debug symbols sounds like riding a bicycle blindfolded.
[15:10:30] <pe> Also enables the compiler to do it wrong.
[15:10:44] <iDrougge> Do it wrong?
[15:10:47] <pe> Cache lines.
[15:11:28] <iDrougge> I know what you mean, but the compiler has a bigger chance to optimise cache lines than a Go programmer does.
[15:11:42] <rb> i trust that my compiler is Sufficiently Smart
[15:11:45] <pe> Only profile-guided.
[15:11:59] <pe> The programmer otherwise knows better.
[15:12:06] <iDrougge> Not a Go programmer.
[15:12:11] <demize> Padding being implementation defined in C means that it can screw you over with that anyway.
[15:12:32] <demize> It probably won't, but it certainly could.
[15:12:33] <pe> It's part of the ABI.
[15:12:57] <pe> And there are tools like pahole.
[15:13:01] <iDrougge> If you care about struct layout so much, you define the structs you care about to have a fixed layout instead.
[15:13:03] <pe> My IDE I think also shows it.
[15:13:23] <pe> And I think there's a compiler warning.
[15:14:01] <iDrougge> But most programmers care more about the layout of the code.
[15:14:55] <demize> In practice the only times I've known of people caring about the exact layout is when they just read something from a file or over the network straight into a struct, which is \o/
[15:14:57] <pe> If the language at least has an attribute for it, it might not be completely awful.
[15:15:02] <iDrougge> So if the compiler must always follow the layout in code, it will generate suboptimal code or the programmer will be forced to spend brain cells worrying about struct layout in code.
[15:16:27] <pe> demize: it's a valid optimization, mmap and you're ready to roll.
[15:16:40] <pe> I think shared-mime-info caches like this...
[15:17:05] <demize> It can be if you actually can ensure that it's fine for said file to not be portable.
[15:17:50] <iDrougge> Yes.
[15:17:59] <pe> Of course.
[15:18:04] <demize> But I think that a lot of people actually cannot, and aren't aware of the fact that it isn't portable.
[15:18:21] <demize> Thus people doing such things with things they e.g. just read over the network.
[15:18:34] <demize> So many crimes.

[19:55:14] <bsandro> go changed so much it becomes a pain to support that stuff, all that backwards compatibility myth is a pile of gosa
[19:55:36] <Zedronar> Cool. We're only using lua for Redis transactions. On the server-side at least.
[19:56:31] <bsandro> we used to have Lua support but the only Lua part were config files for some reason, my predecessors never implemented any scripting after all
[19:59:04] <Zedronar> Do you guys share backend code between projects? We divorced the projects last year; separated repos, services, infra, etc.. We're sharing some core code which for some CS apparently is blasphemy in a microservices architecture.
[19:59:34] <c355E3B> Zedronar: we have a ton of shared libraries we consume across the backend.
[19:59:43] <Zedronar> It did bring some issues, but in the end, how do you go about re-using, e.g, a clan or inbox feature without copy-pasting everything?

[20:02:39] <Zedronar> feoh: Yeah, we try to do that. We have thousands of integration tests, which for a game dev company is a bit amusing. Strong contracts is easier to achieve with C# than NodeJS, though.

[20:34:17] <bsandro> not as much yes. We have all the logic implemented and double checked on client/backend so if someone messes with client and edits some savefiles and stuff breaks completely - that's on them

[22:15:29] <technomancy> gotcha
[22:16:26] <bkhl> In Python it's an extension of having a bunch of letter-prefixes to strings.
[22:16:42] <companion_cube> b'foo' for byte strings, too, yeah
[22:17:16] <bkhl> And r'a.*cool.*regexp\s' for raw strings
[22:17:25] <technomancy> does the rust notation use a letter prefix too?
[22:17:44] <riv> I think its the print macro that's interpreting the string, not the string itself?
[22:17:47] <companion_cube> seems not, it's already a macro after all :p
[22:18:12] <bkhl> Ah, checked what it is now
[22:18:32] <bkhl> So this doesn't add any new string syntax, just a new function when using any of the macros that already use format strings.
[22:18:42] <bkhl> s/function/functionality/
[22:20:13] <bkhl> I guess this is something that's recently become easier to add thanks to the improvements to macros in general.
