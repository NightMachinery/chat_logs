[00:21:11] <bsandro> I've received the new imac today and honestly baffled by the bundled mouse; it feels like a touchpad, it is not a touchpad, and you cannot use it while it is charging
[00:22:05] <kline> >cannot use it while charging
[00:22:14] <kline> this is so you have to buy another when the battery expires
[00:22:32] <kline> you cannot use one with a dead battery in wired mode where the device is powered by cable
[00:22:48] <iDrougge> I recommend the actual touchpad; it can be charged whilst using it. In fact, I always use it connected via USB.

[00:33:49] <kline> lightning is such a small port that i refuse to believe that they couldnt do it

[22:33:47] <feoh> Feels like one of the things that makes Markdown awesome is its UTTER simplicity, but it also feels like it's also an open invitation for people to publish snowflakey extensions which only some small subset of the Markdown using code-base will ever support
[22:34:48] <feoh> Kind of unfortunate that things are either dog simple and hence grow legs like crazy with massive adoption (Markdown) or are TOTALLY extensible but so complex that in their worst case form will obliterate any mind that attempts to engage (XML and RELAX-NG anyone? :) )
[22:35:08] <feoh> JSON also seems to fall into this category
[22:35:16] <technomancy> markdown's perception of simplicity is somewhat surface-level
[22:35:30] <technomancy> IIRC it's canonically defined as a bunch of perl substitutions or something?
[22:35:34] <gerikson> feoh: lol spend some time in Gemini-land and you will learn that Markdown is just a shade less complext than HTML
[22:35:36] <companion_cube> Not anymore
[22:35:37] <wink> it's a classic "usually good enough"
[22:35:59] <gerikson> technomancy: no there's a bunch of nerds put togehter a stnadard
[22:36:02] <companion_cube> At least if you consider commonmark to be the actual markdown
[22:36:06] <wink> I use 4? markdown features. auto-paragraphs, headlines, images, links
[22:36:12] <technomancy> gerikson: right, that's distinct from markdown tho
[22:36:23] <companion_cube> Instead of gruber's shitty perl implementation
[22:36:45] <feoh> Yeah I mean there are just a few baseline Markdown features that EVERYTHING supports
[22:36:58] <feoh> That's what I use, although I do like Github's extensions for code and such :)
[22:37:18] <drobilla> RDF had the potential to split that extensible/simple difference, I think, but it was severely botched and ended up largely worse than XML in most of those ways
[22:37:23] <wink> markdown for me is the best way of writing short texts. not that it's the best format
[22:37:27] <companion_cube> 😉 no lists?
[22:37:31] <feoh> companion_cube: Yeah his original is pretty awful but I DO give him credit for coming up with it and getting it adopted/
[22:37:36] <companion_cube> Sure
[22:37:46] <companion_cube> But how adoption is driven by cmark
[22:37:51] <companion_cube> And gfm
[22:37:51] <technomancy> anyway I use markdown too, but not because it's good or simple.
[22:37:53] <gerikson> I still use Gruber's orginal perl script
[22:38:18] <wink> I mean.. reST. creole..
[22:38:27] <technomancy> markdown is the English of text doc formatters
[22:38:29] <feoh> The static site generator that I use, Pelican, wants to use ReStructured Text, and I can't get my brain around actually typing it for all the tea in China. End up mixing in Markdown constructs. Same when I tried to adopt emacs org-mode (Which is AMAZING)
[22:38:35] <technomancy> it's a goddamn mess but you use it anyway
[22:38:47] <feoh> Thankfully Pelican also supports Markdown.
[22:38:47] <gerikson> I never grokked RDF
[22:38:54] <imode> what's the latin of text doc formatters.
[22:38:55] <drobilla> I use Markdown with Pelican
[22:38:59] <gerikson> it didn't help that everyone represented it in xML
[22:39:07] <imode> gerikson: all about dem triples baybeee.
[22:39:09] <technomancy> imode: SGML
[22:39:11] <drobilla> gerikson: Yeah, most don't, and it's very much not your fault
[22:39:15] <gerikson> triple threat
[22:39:17] <imode> technomancy: hahahahahahahahahaha.

[22:40:11] <feoh> Nice! Won't ask for the theme but would you be willing to leak your blog URL?
[22:40:46] <feoh> I should really write my own too. It'd finally teach me some HTML/CSS beyond the pidgin I know now.

[22:41:26] <feoh> heh

[22:47:32] <drobilla> feoh: thanks
[22:47:39] <companion_cube> rST is horrible to read
[22:47:57] <companion_cube> and all the tooling is in python, with a single implementation of each thing
[22:48:01] <feoh> companion_cube: Also for me anyway horrible to write :) My brain and fingers rebel at :tag: for everything
[22:48:02] <technomancy> if it's a compliment it's an extremely backhanded one
[22:48:23] <drobilla> Super dumb layouts are also easy to make nice on mobile
[22:48:23] <companion_cube> english is popular and efficient
[22:48:26] <companion_cube> albeit quirky, ofc
[22:48:41] <technomancy> popular and batshittingly inconsistent
[22:48:59] <companion_cube> lol but what language isn't?

[22:49:46] <technomancy> adoption is a curse

[23:02:29] <feoh> and I just kinda feel like I'm fighting the stock Pelican theme
[23:03:03] <feoh> like in my latest post, my first phrase is kinda weirdly wrapped around the right justified anchor blurb at the top, at least the way I roll with large font sizes :)
[23:03:13] <feoh> I'd rather it tried less hard to be fancy and just presented the information.
[23:03:46] <drobilla> Yeah, sounds like a lot where I was at before I decided to just copy the thing and mangle it as I like
[23:05:05] <drobilla> Being a hopeless former/wannabe academic, I try to find inspiration in typesetting rather than web design these days.  It's clean and makes accessibility a lot easier
[23:05:56] <feoh> Heh. Academia is kinda odd. It's simultaneously SO much easier and more chill than industry and also orders of magnitude harder, but in a very different way
