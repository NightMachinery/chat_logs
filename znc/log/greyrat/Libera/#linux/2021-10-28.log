[00:50:32] <kveroneau> Hmm, I find that there's a lot of different perspectives on how a Docker image should be used.  Some suggest using bind mounts to the host file system, placing all the application code there, and then just upgrading the docker image when a new version of the image is available, as you are suggesting.  The main concern about this, is being able to easily roll back to a previous version, or have QAs test a newer version.

[00:52:25] <kveroneau> This makes the docker image a bit more portable, as it contains both the application's runtime(Python, PHP, Java, etc), along with the application code in a nice tightly distributable package.
[00:53:28] <luva> ananke there is nothing I did to fstab except change the uuids
[00:53:37] <ananke> kveroneau: most decent projects tag each of their releases, so rolling back to a given image is trivial
[00:53:41] <kveroneau> This way, there's no need to worry about bind mounts to an external source, and updating this external source when the application code changes, just build a new docker image based on the base image with all your applicaton code, and deploy away.

[08:35:53] <rcf> Itanium makes that much more complicated than it would normally be, as other architectures at least have the pretense of executing a serial string of individual instructions featuring an invidual opcode.

[08:36:32] <mlu> gladys: the idea is that it can get a little impractical if the CPU is running in a big loop 100% of the time, so you can have interrupts for the CPU to do stuff when something external happens (i.e. someone presses a button)
[08:36:51] <mlu> if you want a good, practical RISC ISA, look into ARM
[08:37:04] <gladys> are interrupts mutually exclusive with intermittent pollibg
[08:37:11] <gladys> polling
[08:37:12] <mlu> don't like ARM? look into MIPS or RISC-V (RISC-V is a spiritual descendent of MIPS and looks very similar)

[08:37:42] <yeeb3> i just farted
[08:37:43] <rcf> Whereas on Itanium you can't do that. To simplify the silicon the task of parallelzing instructions to take advantage of the superscalar architecture is almost entirely offloaded onto the programmer, and every instruction contains a group of operations which are selected to best utilize the hardware. It turns out that this is absurdly difficult and performance was initially abysmal and never
[08:37:46] <rcf> competitive with x86 throughout its entire lifetime.
[08:37:52] <gladys> but they are two separate ways of doing similar thing?

[10:11:16] <zumba_addict> thoughts on a very hard technical question? :)

[13:30:00] <Sauvin> (and ONT?)
[13:30:08] <cren> hey, I have a question about forking. I'm doing a practice exercise on forking using python code and I've found that if I run the program and pipe the output to another command or a file, the output is different than if the output is sent directly to a TTY
[13:30:33] <lericson> cren: example?
[13:31:23] <Sauvin> cren, how is the output generated, what differences are you seeing, and TO what are you outputting?
[13:31:50] <cren> The program runs two instances of a program concurrently, one of which prints "I am the parent $i" and one of which prints "I am the child $i" with i from 1 to 100
[13:32:12] <hexnewbie> cren: Some programs like their output different when there is a TTY (e.g. ls, grep --color=auto, gzip). Python can also face some discrepancies if program is badly coded
[13:32:53] <Sauvin> cren, what were you expecting to see?

[13:33:45] *** Joins: csrf (~csrf@user/csrf)
[13:33:49] <cren> But when outputting to a file or piping, all the output from one instance comes first
[13:34:11] <cren> So for example "I am the parent 1"..."I am the parent 100" followed by "I am the child 1"..."I am the child 100"
[13:34:15] <hexnewbie> cren: That's a race condition and/or buffering, you can't expect parallel stuff to run deterministically
[13:34:21] <RayTracer> Sauvin: GPON==gigabit passive optical network, ONT==optical network terminal, where fibre -> copper

[13:35:16] *** Joins: ThanatosJ (~Thanatos@197.210.29.230)
[13:35:17] <Sauvin> cren, worse, you can't expect the parent process to run at the same rate as the child. The different processes will sustain different small delays at un predictable junctures. Welcome to asynchrony.
[13:35:28] <cren> But what surprised me is that the behaviour is different when piping or redirecting
[13:35:47] <Sauvin> cren, yea, sounds like one process is filling the pipe before the other gets to it.
[13:35:51] <hexnewbie> cren: The output to the file is probably not line-buffered
[13:36:11] <hexnewbie> cren: So all 128 KB will be buffered at once

[13:38:16] <cren> hexnewbie: ahh, that makes sense. So the output from one instance is being written all at once because it's stored in the same buffer? I'm not familiar with how writing to files works in detail

[16:09:31] <hexnewbie> My crystal ball is saying the combination of recording the session *and* Zoom is the problem here. Have never used Zoom, but is it a heavy web app like everything these days? Those can be heavy, and do a lot of screen writing (even outside the fact that they are playing video), which combined with the screen recording, can make the single-threaded X server slowing down.
[16:10:29] *** Joins: HyN0X (~HyNoX@151.35.98.55)
[16:10:47] <hexnewbie> Not the same as video recording exactly, but relies on similar principles of capturing the window image: sometimes having a remote web app loaded through X2go is slow as hell. Also related, the X server input and windows can lag terribly if a remote X client is itself lagging. One can easily see how putting those things together can escalate into local lagging as well

[19:18:23] <TheGuestMovie> so the issue is that someone with no audio background like Lennart Poettering decided he wanted to write something better to use than ALSA, and because this half-assed solution existed, in the absence of something better, everyone used it?

[19:26:15] <katp32> jackiee: ALSA has two parts, the kernel interface, which is how user programs talk to the audio drivers (ALWAYS, regardless of what programs you're running), and a userspace library called alsa-lib which handles mixing (since kernel/drivers don't do mixing directly). you only need those two pieces in order to use audio on linux. additionall, many systems use a "sound daemon" such as JACK or
[19:26:17] <katp32> PulseAudio, which gives you additional features like the ability to route different apps to different sound cards, or route them to each other, control their volume independently, etc. sound daemons are strictly optional, but are extremely convenient. that's the grand tour of audio on linux ;D

[19:32:19] <katp32> the thing to remember about ALSA is that two programs cannot be using the same sound device at the same time; if you want more than one application playing audio at once, you either have to use a sound daemon like JACK or PulseAudio, or alsa-lib mixing with plugins like dmix. PulseAudio does not use dmix, so if PulseAudio is running, it will bind to your sound device and you won't be able to use it

[19:59:02] <ayecee> there's your problem
[19:59:56] <katp32> if you're using a lot of resources to do something you only need a little resources to do, that's wasting resources, that's what that means

[20:00:45] <TheGuestMovie> Actually I think I started doing this during those 2 months I ran Linux natively. Bug makes an app use more than the 4GB of system RAM I had, swaps to disk, PC unusable, can't kill the app because desktop is not responding to input.

[20:30:46] <Psi-Jack> I DO however have issue sometimes emailing certain mail providers, like freaking Microsoft's outlook.com
[20:30:50] <katp32> for example, "Proofpoint"'s cutting-edge AI-powered premium quality spam filter blocks the entire IP range belonging to the Linode Toronto location, and will not respond to anyone about it, not me, not Linode staff. so yeah, be prepared to deal with that sort of nonsense
[20:30:50] <Psi-Jack> They blacklist FIRST, then allow.

[20:32:37] <katp32> obviously latency could be an issue depending on where your host is, but as long as the ping to your host is fairly low, it's not a big deal. that said, it's obviously still preferable to just use port forwarding, only do that if you can't use port forwarding, eg if you're stuck with carrier NAT

[20:41:15] <TheGuestMovie> but some VPS (OpenVZ types) might not allow VPN
[20:41:18] <Nitrousoxide> I've got two binary files and I want to concatenate them to stdin for use with dd. I tried using cat but it seems that it's interpreting the null bytes as eof. Is there another command that'll ignore the nulls?
[20:41:18] <Wafficus> I'm thinking Optiplexes at home --> VPN --> VPS: allows people to connect to the server
[20:41:22] <katp32> the VPN I run only uses ipv6, but alas some devices on the VPN need to be able to access ipv4 servers outside the network, so I have to assign ipv4 addresses to those handful of devices, which is annoying

[20:44:54] <rascul> it does what it's supposed to do, though, so there's that
[20:44:55] <katp32> I had a pretty similar setup; I run a webserver, email, etc on my VPS directly, and I used to run some heavier stuff (game servers) on a local machine connected via the VPN

[23:46:49] <lacroix> v4, they exist... in the unix concept of "everything's a file" directories are just files with tables listing other files
[23:46:59] <Kim^J> But the general idea is what I described

[23:49:22] <v4> lacroix: Thanks. Okay, so let's take a standard extX filesystem. And I'm combining what Kim told me earlier here with my assumptions - there's a filesystem inode table which stores inode identifiers, physical disk locations, and meta information right? Then a directory would have a listing in that inode table, but to actually figure out the
[23:49:22] <v4> contents in a directory, you'd look a the physical disk location of that directory inode and that phsyical disk location would contain another table with filenames and inode identifiers right?
[23:49:25] *** Quits: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter) (Quit: ars longa vita brevis)
[23:50:33] <lacroix> you can try something like: cat -v /tmp
[23:50:34] <lacroix> in the traditional unix semantic, that will open(2) /tmp as a regular file and display its contents on the standard output
[23:50:42] <lacroix> on most modern unixes, it will just result in a zero length read (no output)

[23:52:50] <Kim^J> Dagmar: It found stuff? xD
[23:53:00] <lacroix> in ext2fs, inodes are scattered at intervals through the filesystem, and an inode can be assigned a file type (symlink, directory, etc) which will alter how the operating system interacts with that inode

[23:53:58] <Dagmar> I've had this VM off for about two months because I'd already fixed everything and backported it into the automation
[23:54:04] <v4> lacroix: Intresting, and then is each directory in an ext2fs its own table of filesystem names and then inode identifiers?
[23:54:07] <Kim^J> The security peeps I've met are terrible programmers
