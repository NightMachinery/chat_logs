[09:15:33] <sunjonSenghanBri> so yes, of course it's another way!
[09:18:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> I don't think it's even hard. Look at this example:
[09:18:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> https://gist.github.com/sos4nt/3187620
[09:20:56] <reticuli> agreed
[09:21:46] <sunjonSenghanBri> the `use=` specifies a terminfo to inherit from, then you have the sitm/ritm parameters to override for italic (sU for underline, md for bold? - find the full list here: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xcurses/terminfo.html )
[09:23:13] <sunjonSenghanBri> this is based on the assumption that if you didn't want these features in vim; You didn't want them anywhere

[09:38:50] <Famiu[m]> <hwrd> "oh, lua definitely, wanna..." <- The most basic layout then would be to have a `lua` directory in the project root folder
[09:39:18] <Famiu[m]> And a directory with the same name as your plugin or whatever you want the plugin's Lua module to be named
[09:39:35] <Famiu[m]> * be named inside the `lua` directory
[09:40:25] <Famiu[m]> For example, I have the `lua/feline` directory in Feline and so users have to use `require('feline')` when using the Lua module for the plugin

[09:41:14] <Famiu[m]> Put a file named `init.lua` inside the `lua/<module name>` folder, and that's what'll be executed when the module is `require`'d
[09:41:41] <Famiu[m]> So for example, in Feline there's `lua/feline/init.lua`
[09:42:20] <Famiu[m]> And then you can have additional subdirectories inside the `lua/<plugin name>` directory to further modularize the plugin if you wish
[09:42:56] <Famiu[m]> And if you want to `require` those modules just use the module path, but replace the '/' characters with a `.`

[13:22:30] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah, that's true, I would need to look at exactly what they are doing, but there are basically two ways to do it and neither is great
[13:23:03] <vigoux[m]> Let me guess
[13:23:36] <vigoux[m]> Passing ranges to the server, and building temporary buffers that you keep in sync with each other (with some kind of "transfer")
[13:23:54] <vigoux[m]> Why isn't there some kind of "meta-lsp" that does that though ?
[13:24:05] <mjlbach[m]> (or embedding a virtual buffer)

[13:35:15] <vigoux[m]> The point of nvim (and any text editor really) is to provide a platform to edit text in an efficient / comfortable manner

[13:35:38] <Famiu[m]> That seems not worth implementing
[13:36:04] <clason[m]> That's a different argument, and the whole point here ;)
[13:36:14] <Famiu[m]> Maybe one could instead make an Orgmode LSP server that could use other LSP servers to provide diagnostics?
[13:36:20] <Famiu[m]> Would that be possible?

[13:36:26] <vigoux[m]> clason[m]: Quite frankly (without being rude in any way), I don't see what me being a maintainer adds to this whole debate though
[13:36:45] <mjlbach[m]> The point is the design of neovim's change tracking code means we would have to have a major regression in performance in order to accomodate region level change tracking 
[13:36:51] <Famiu[m]> clason[m]: I was not aware
[13:37:08] <clason[m]> (It's a valid feature request related to the core aims of the project, and as such is worth considering, but of course that consideration includes a cost-benefit ratio analysis, which may come down against the feature.)

[13:37:18] <vigoux[m]> I agree that I don't see why people don't make a "meta-lsp"

[13:37:38] <vigoux[m]> You plug in multiple lsps, tree-sitter because you can
[13:37:42] <Famiu[m]> I certainly wouldn't mind the feature
[13:38:16] <Famiu[m]> But I'd also prefer not having the feature over performance regression
[13:38:17] <clason[m]> vigoux[m]: I wanted to make sure you're not being misunderstood as a random person demanding a certain feature.
[13:38:17] <Famiu[m]> That's purely my own opinion
[13:38:17] <ii14[m]> DavideP[m]: you can give counts to it I think, like `2zm`. if you want more control you could do something like `:let &foldlevel = &foldlevel + 2`
[13:38:49] <mjlbach[m]> Also regardless of the change tracking, the whole feature seems quite error prone
[13:39:08] <Famiu[m]> Are Meta-LSP servers possible?
[13:39:17] <mjlbach[m]> Sure, that's what volar is to some extent
[13:39:25] <Famiu[m]> What's volar
[13:39:30] <vigoux[m]> mjlbach[m]: link ?
[13:39:37] <mjlbach[m]> (it's for vue)
[13:40:05] <mjlbach[m]> it's not a meta server for multiple servers
[13:40:05] <vigoux[m]> https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar
[13:41:25] <DavideP[m]> ii14[m]: the shortcuts exactly increase foldlevel value, so I can play with that. thanks again
[13:41:51] <mjlbach[m]> also note shoving a sever between your language server and neovim will also add latency :) 
[13:42:14] <vigoux[m]> Even if it's just a little proxy-like things
[13:43:08] <vigoux[m]> Oh but maybe I look to the thing more in the buffer-wise view, and not project-wise

[15:55:10] <Mathias[m]1> Virtual buffers wouldn't be enough, you'd need to emulate a filesystem because many language servers access the files directly and don't operate entirely on the text synchronisation data.

[18:37:20] <MrElendig> ashnur: https://vimcolorschemes.com/ might interest you
[18:37:32] <MrElendig> and a couple of other websites like that
[18:41:02] <ashnur> ?
[18:41:52] <ashnur> I am not sure how, I would like to cycle in my editor, through the colorschemes, without having to write :Telescope colorschemes and selecting it, or by :colorscheme whatever 
[18:42:03] <ashnur> something like :colorscheme <next>
[18:43:08] <ashnur> I tried to search for such a plugin, but couldn't find, there are a couple that do colorscheme selection, but not just simply selecting the next one
[18:44:13] <MrElendig> that would be rather easy to script
[18:46:20] <ashnur> That was what I was asking, thanks
[18:46:37] <ashnur> I know nothing, didn't want to chase something that's difficult

[22:04:26] <fullstopslash[m]> I've got a syntax question if anyone is game to explain it to me. For context I use the Gitsigns plugin and some markdown syntax rules to replace markdown style checkboxes with a single character checkbox from a nerdfont .   As far as I can tell, everything is behaving as it should with the exception of when the characters are concealed with the Gitsigns line highlight on in the background. The conceal character keeps the background
[22:04:26] <fullstopslash[m]> setting from the normal background.  I know I probably need to add some setting where the cchar checks if it's on top a GitsignsAddLn group or somesuch like that, but I'm currently at a loss as to which way to proceed. Anyone have a clue?  I'm attaching a picture for reference.
