[05:03:13] <henko> hi. how do I prevent a user to type into a terminal while a loop is echoing to stdout?
[05:03:40] <henko> take this while loop for example
[05:03:44] <henko> date1=`date +%s`; while true; do echo -ne "$(date -u --date @$((`date +    %s` - $date1)) +%H:%M:%S)\r"; sleep 0.1; done
[05:04:14] <henko> i made an alias for it: stopwatch='...'
[05:05:00] <henko> now when i type '$ stopwatch' I get the expected output... it counts from 0 to infinity unless closed with ^C
[05:05:30] <henko> but I can type in the terminal gibberish and it will overwrite until the next echo in to loop
[05:05:40] <henko> how do I prevent a user from doing that?
[05:06:15] <twkm> you cannot.  some terminals have an inhibit ability, but it is far from universal.
[05:06:16] <henko> i tried doing $ stopwatch < /dev/null
[05:06:45] <twkm> it is the terminal that matters, not the program or even the system tty handler.
[05:06:56] <henko> twkm: ah okay
[05:07:08] <henko> I'm using alacritty... thanks for the pointer
[05:07:10] <eschwartz> both the user's fingers->keyboard, and your program, are writing to the current tty
[05:09:20] <twkm> you might hide what's typed by turning off echo with stty before starting the program, then eat and discard anything present before turning echo back on.  but that's fairly fake, it wouldn't stop the user causing signals when they type the intr, quit, etc., characters.
[05:10:42] <henko> twkm: signals are okay. i just don't want the user to overwrite the terminal output
[05:10:44] <eschwartz> well, you could also catch and ignore all signals other than KILL
[05:10:58] <eschwartz> kind of impolite, but hey
[05:11:00] <henko> otherwise I wouldn't be able to close the program with ^C

[10:20:05] <doug16k> even the most basic regex has that right?

[10:20:45] <Soliton> !=~

After a successful match, the BASH_REMATCH array contains the matched string and subexpressions (if any). Any quoted characters in the ERE become literal. Best to put the whole ERE in a variable: [[ $string =~ $regex ]]

[18:43:33] <eoli3n> when i start the screen, and run "jobs" inside i don't see anything

[20:09:09] <ManDay> Ah well, and here I was putting my confidence into the comment at the beginning of .bashrc: "This file is sourced by all *interactive* bash shells on startup"
[20:09:58] <ManDay> bash(1) is better on this: "When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, ..."
[20:11:16] <ManDay> Is there any logic to this rule?
[20:11:26] <llua> bash's start up is pretty weird
[20:11:31] <Soliton> !dotfiles
[20:11:31] <greybot> Set up your environment (PATH, LANG, EDITOR, ...) in ~/.bash_profile. Set up your bash shell (PS1, functions, shopts, ...) in ~/.bashrc. Then source .bashrc from .bash_profile. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles>. For GUI logins, SEE YOUR DOCUMENTATION or ask your OS channel because they're all different and we don't know.
[20:12:28] <ManDay> Soliton: Right, I understand how I must use it. But I wonder whether I can give an interpretation/meaning to .bashrc and .bash_profile which evidently explains why one is sourced and not the other.

[20:12:50] <ManDay> (and what it matters whether you consider it a "login" shell or not)
[20:12:57] <earnestly> The cargo-cult "am I really interactive tho?" check that ends up at the top of .bashrc is useless, and only exists because distros build bash with dumb flags (disabled by default)
[20:13:29] <Soliton> do expensive, one-off stuff in .bash_profile and the rest in .bashrc.
[20:13:35] <earnestly> E.g. https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-packages/blob/packages/bash/trunk/PKGBUILD#L50
[20:14:20] <ManDay> Soliton: Yeah but that's how I have it. I only have the exports (PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc.) in .bash_profile and my custom functions in .bashrc
[20:14:40] <Soliton> if you for whatever reason you don't want to do some .bashrc stuff for login shells because you already do it differently in .bash_profile or whatever then you can decide not to source it.
[20:15:04] <Soliton> clearly you don't have the source .bashrc part.
[20:15:17] *** Joins: ByteSlayer (~byteslaye@user/byteslayer)

[20:16:22] <llua> objectively bash not sourcing ~/.bashrc for interactive shells is inconsistent. separate from historical behavior
[20:17:08] <Soliton> it allows you to decide if you want to or not but i agree it doesn't seem very useful.
[20:17:09] <ManDay> i don't see why bash would distinguish between "interactive login" and "interactive non-login" shell

[20:20:42] <Soliton> can't tell what problem the question implies.
[20:21:57] <earnestly> llua: That's not useful, and unless bash was built with that -DNON_ flag it doesn't do anything
[20:22:06] <e36freak> ManDay: .bashrc
[20:22:06] <ManDay> llua: yeah, I've cut+paste that thing from .bashrc over to .bash_profile
[20:22:13] <ManDay> there it makes more sense
[20:22:19] <e36freak> !dotfiles
[20:22:19] <greybot> Set up your environment (PATH, LANG, EDITOR, ...) in ~/.bash_profile. Set up your bash shell (PS1, functions, shopts, ...) in ~/.bashrc. Then source .bashrc from .bash_profile. See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles>. For GUI logins, SEE YOUR DOCUMENTATION or ask your OS channel because they're all different and we don't know.
[20:22:23] <ManDay> now I source .bashrc from .bashprofile if the login shell is interactive
[20:22:27] <earnestly> They want to source .bashrc from .bash_profile
[20:22:45] <earnestly> Testing $- in .bashrc is pure cult
[20:23:40] <earnestly> (There is a reason why you might want to do it, but first you'll have to find out why.  If you know why, then you can use it without being a cultist :p)

[20:26:46] <ManDay> ah yeah
[20:26:54] <ManDay> though they don't check for interactive, so .bashrc is effectively sourced in non-interactive login shells too

[23:01:33] <Filystyn> detect if in string we have printable characters
[23:01:35] <Filystyn> hymu ?
[23:03:06] <Filystyn> also could strip from printable I guess with awk.. ?
[23:03:10] <Filystyn> not sure that would work tho
[23:03:17] <Filystyn> not printable*
[23:04:04] <twkm> look for non-printables.
[23:04:55] <twkm> or remove them, e.g., printable=${randomstuff//[![:print:]]}.
[23:05:41] <Filystyn> awk -NF did the job but thx
[23:05:50] <Filystyn> 'NF' **

[23:58:51] <bn_work> I wonder if it's getting lost in non-standard file type, tried adding `--exclude='/proc/.*'` but it seems to have no effect...
