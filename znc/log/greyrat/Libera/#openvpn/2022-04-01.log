[03:58:32] <Xanthaos> I am now noticing a new problem, and think I may have an idea why. When I am connected to my home network, my lan, and access machines in the lan, the machines show me as connecting from the vpn, even though I am directly connected via wifi to my home lan. In my windows 10 routing table, I am noticing that everything else is metric 50 or above (some as high as 331), but the route pushed by 
[03:58:32] <Xanthaos> the vpn server is metric 35 <cont>
[03:58:36] *** Quits: mannequin (uid453465@id-453465.helmsley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[03:59:24] <Xanthaos> Is there a way I can change this so that it has a higher metric, so that a lan path would be preferred, and the vpn path would kick in only when the lan path is unavailable?
[04:06:15] *** Quits: becm (~becm@55d4fad7.access.ecotel.net) (Quit: quit)
[04:08:13] <BtbN> How about disconnecting from the VPN when in the very network it connects to?
[04:08:23] <BtbN> Having multiple routes to the same network is bad news and very broken
[04:12:07] <rob0> this ^^ is what "!whatis welcome 8"  was about
[04:12:58] <rob0> metrics aren't going to do much, because in any case only one route will win
[04:14:35] <Xanthaos> Yeah I guess I'll have to stop the client from loading the service automatically, which I had done for the benefit of my wife so she doesn't have to start the vpn manually (I want to minimize the stuff she has to do, it's better for both of us lol)
[04:14:54] <BtbN> That's what you got NetworkManager for.
[04:15:01] <rob0> If you really are emotionally attached to your multiple 192.168.0.0/24 networks, check out OpenVPN Cloud service
[04:15:54] <BtbN> The "way of least effort" approach to this would be to configure a firewall rule on the VPN server to reject connections to OpenVPN from within :D
[04:16:10] <BtbN> But it's definitely not a pretty solution
[04:17:51] <Xanthaos> Okay, I didn't know if I could push a metric that was way above the metrics on the client if that would allow me to leave the vpn client service loading automatically. I just disabled it, so I'll have to show her how to start it up.
[04:18:55] <BtbN> I'm pretty sure you can configure NetworkManager to connect to a VPN for a specific network
[04:19:29] <Xanthaos> the client is a windows 10 laptop
[04:21:42] <Xanthaos> Okay, turning the service off will solve the problem. I may just activate the service for her before she goes anywhere she will be taking the laptop.
[04:22:17] <Xanthaos> thanks :)
[04:29:13] <rob0> NM's openvpn implementation sucks.
[04:29:48] <rob0> It assumes every VPN must necessarily be a full tunnel, regardless what routes are actually pushed.
[04:30:10] <rob0> and it replaces the pushed routes with its own garbage
[04:30:30] <rob0> !networkmanager
[04:30:31] <vpnHelper> rob0: Error: "networkmanager" is not a valid command.
[04:30:35] <rob0> !nm
[04:30:37] <vpnHelper> rob0: Error: "nm" is not a valid command.
[04:30:57] <rob0> well, we used to have something like that
[04:31:02] <rob0> !ubuntu
[04:31:03] <vpnHelper> rob0: dont use network manager to configure your vpns! get it working via commandline and then import to network manager if you want to use it.
[04:32:48] <BtbN> You can turn that off just fine
[04:33:14] <BtbN> But it by default puts redirect-gateway into the client config, yeah
[04:34:01] <BtbN> Xanthaos, why don't you use the OpenVPN GUI? Turning on and off a VPN with that is two clicks
[04:34:33] <rob0> I wish they had a simple --config in NM, so you don't have to break up an inline config file
[04:35:50] <Xanthaos> that's the new plan. If she is going out for a day, she can activate it. If she is going on a business trip for a week, I'll just turn on the service, save her having to deal with it every time.
[04:36:17] <BtbN> Why have it default-on anyway?
[04:37:22] <BtbN> Like, if it connects to your home LAN, and tunnels all traffic via it, that's quite a latency and speed killer

[04:52:50] <Xanthaos> two reasons. first I do take the laptop out a bit, as does she, and I do have one machine in my network that cannot be accessed by the lan ip address, it can only be accessed by one specific vpn address. You guessed it...
[04:54:33] <BtbN> That sounds like a case for a VPN without redirect-gateway. Though you very much would still want to turn that off when at home.

[05:10:21] <Xanthaos> I'm just gonna have to rethink the whole thing. There's got to be a way.
[05:23:02] <Xanthaos> Well it beats the solution I saw on openvpn site: 'push "route 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0 vpn_gateway 100"' I am reading the only resource I can find (reference manual, but I believe it's for the ovpn access server as it mentions http interface). can someone first tell me what the vpn-gateway 100 will do and then give me a url to the deeply detailed documentation for 2.4.12-1.el7 ?
[05:32:09] <rob0> "man openvpn"
[05:32:23] <rob0> see --push and --route
[05:32:47] <rob0> it is not AS-specific syntax
[05:33:20] <rob0> !man
[05:33:21] <vpnHelper> rob0: (#1) see https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Openvpn24ManPage for the man pages, or (#2) the man pages are your friend!, or (#3) Protip: you can search the manpage for a specific --option (with dashes) to find it quicker, or (#4) 'man openvpn' on a Unix system with OpenVPN installed
[05:34:00] <rob0> ^^ that is not the current manual URL, but it might work for your  ancient OS
[05:34:25] <thumbs> rob0: be careful who you call ancient
[05:34:36] <rob0> good point
[05:34:51] <rob0> thumbs down for me!
[05:35:26] <thumbs> what distro are they using anyway?
[05:36:09] <rob0> RHEL 7
[05:36:27] <rob0> openvpn 2.4.12
[05:36:47] <thumbs> RHEL 7 isn't that bad, provided you yum'ed to the latest revision
[05:37:28] <thumbs> but 2.4.12, yikes
[05:49:11] <Xanthaos> lol yes for the moment rhel 7, but I am already putting together everything I need to migrate to 8 or 9. I'm actually waiting to see how soon 9 goes full release and I'll go with that. If not soon, as in a few months, I'll be going 8. And yes I always yum the latest version in the repos.
[05:49:34] <thumbs> 7.9 is passable, yes
[05:53:48] <Xanthaos> Yep, it's currently being supported, but going EOL soon, so I'm prepping for the upgrade. in the meantime I still need to keep things working. Right now I've got to hard console into that one machine and (against my better wishes) open up ssh to the lan. Even if it's just open to a single lan address, that is contrary to the idea I had in mind, where that machine was only accessible by one 
[05:53:48] <Xanthaos> vpn machine. <cont>
[05:53:56] <Xanthaos> I'll come up with another idea...

[16:41:26] <clarkk> When I connect to my vpn provider via openvpn, the ipv6 address of my wifi interface is being exposed. How do I prevent this leak?
[16:42:27] <rob0> !both
[16:42:29] <vpnHelper> rob0: (#1) If you do not control both ends of the link (server and client) then there is not much we can do to help you. Please talk to your network admin instead., or (#2) if you dont have access to both sides, come back when you do
[16:42:59] <rob0> The --redirect-gateway setting has a flag to disable ipv6.
[16:43:12] <clarkk> ok thanks
[16:43:25] <rob0> Does your provider not give you ipv6?
[16:43:37] <rob0> your VPN provider, I mean
[16:54:17] <clarkk> I don't know actually
[16:54:42] <clarkk> I don't use ipv6 myself. I don't really understand the need, when ipv4 still works fine
[16:56:53] <rob0> well, a Luddite way of dealing with it is to disable ipv6 in your OS.
[16:57:15] <rob0> If Linux you can blacklist the ipv6 module.
[16:58:15] <rob0> The time for ipv6 is here; ipv4 is uncomfortably tight at this time.

[20:54:45] <Pippin_> you can set the logging to --verb 4 and view what is pushed by server, then use --pull-filter to bar whatever you want

[21:07:43] <doelie> Pippin_: thanks. i managed to use the filter. what i want in addition is to capture the route-gateway option and use it elsewhere to set up some custom plumbing. server sends diffent ip every time so only workaround i can see at this time is to fish it from the logs with a script.
[21:10:27] <doelie> basically the host that openvpn client runs on should not set gateway (which i can ignore with pull filter), but i need to capture this ip and send it to another host.  possibly just making this too complicated also...
