[01:45:27] <Piru> man. qemu is borken. it doesn't handle byte reads/writes to IDE data registers
[01:45:40] <Piru> I had to fix my IDE driver :-P
[01:47:04] <Piru> apparently (I guess for performance reasons) qemu only detects 16-bit or 32-bit accesses to the hw registers
[01:47:22] <Piru> this at least on ppc32 emulation
[01:48:54] <fgeek> why do you have ide? what hardware?
[01:48:56] <Piru> fair bit of headscratching ensued why cdrecord would lock up the ide drived under qemu. but since it didn't see the full data being read it would never send the IRQ of the compeleted operation. cdrecord sends MODE SENSE 6 command with 1 byte size
[01:50:19] <Piru> fgeek: -machine mac99,via=pmu
[01:52:20] <Piru> fgeek: I work on an operating system and it's fastest to test it on qemu
[01:53:55] <fgeek> okay :)
[01:54:22] <Piru> it
[01:55:11] <Piru> it's pretty neat to be able to take my hobby anywhere I go. regardless if I run arm or amd64 or whatever. lugging around a 20 year old mac would suck more

[13:11:33] *** Joins: ajak (~ajak@gentoo/developer/ajak)
[13:11:51] <bagder> why would a custom toolchain break that?
[13:12:36] <bagder> or put another way: the configure script runs a few executables for testing
[13:12:44] <bagder> so if it can't find the libs then, those tests will fail
[13:13:02] <dege> first day back after mostly not having touched a keyboard since Dec 21 .. how does all this computering now work again?
[13:13:48] <amosbird> bagder: Yes. It's basically a cross compilation. Executables won't be able to run at all. Can I just by pass this check?
[13:13:58] <bagder> dege: yay, welcome back to the struggle! =)
[13:14:18] <bagder> amosbird: configure does avoid that if it knows it's a cross-compile...
[13:14:50] <amosbird> bagder: then I need to tell it somehow explicitly...
[13:15:29] <dege> bagder: \o/ .. and a big thanks to the Internet for not reporting any vulnerabilities over the break .. I have alerting to not miss those it was all peaceful
[13:15:52] <bagder> dege: I trust you saw an email yday about one we have in the queue atm
[13:16:16] <bagder> there's one giving me a little head scratching
[13:16:24] <gevaerts> dege: it's the future now! We don't use keyboards anymore this year, we use holographic touchscreens!
[13:16:30] <dege> bagder: yup, workintg through it as we speak (I actually read the thread as it unfolded but didn't have time to weigh in)
[13:16:55] <bagder> cool
[13:16:57] <bagder> no rush
[13:17:32] <dege> gevaerts: as long as they support vi bindings I can adapt
[13:18:11] <Piru> libcurl cross compiles just fine
[13:18:23] <Piru> similar to most other libraries
[13:20:52] <amosbird> Piru: yeah, but how can I ./configure it as if it's cross compiling?
[13:21:16] <amosbird> The custom toolchain I use has a different sysroot and libc
[13:31:20] <Piru> with well configured toolchains it's just a matter of --host whatever and then --with-xxxx where xxxx is one of the ssl backends
[13:31:34] <Piru> if it is not well configure toolchain ymmv

[13:41:32] <bagder> nope
[13:42:37] <bagder> that's a mighty weird problem
[13:43:01] <jfuller> not sure there is much we can do about it

[13:45:00] <jfuller> docker run curlimages/curl:7.80.0 curl -- domain.com -v resolves 
[13:46:32] <bagder> right, I imagine there's something special for this user

[13:48:19] <bagder> I'd suspect something like that too, as we don't see this problem in "normal" curl
[13:49:03] <jfuller> something is weird

[13:50:26] <jfuller> I get equal output
[13:51:03] <jfuller> eg
[13:51:11] <Piru> usually such "old version works" resolves to differences in environment or similar. that for example the old image actually uses different dns options / servers or such
