[21:26:01] <ThePendulum> joepie91: ziggo, apparently the guy disabled our old modem before arriving. we got a new one but he didn't bother to mention we wouldn't have internet until we'd install that one
[21:26:56] <joepie91> welp, of course it's ziggo...
[21:26:59] <ThePendulum> I even asked him if he took down our internet before arriving, he said he changed some setting on the modem... I feel it is somewhat relevant to mention that setting completely bricks it, lol
[21:27:24] <joepie91> lol
[21:27:32] <ThePendulum> he changed our main connection box and just dumped the old one on the basement floor
[21:28:19] <ThePendulum> I lol'd the, the guy comes in just immediately admitting "I haven't got the faintest clue why I'm here", there's a lot more wrong than just the mechanic himself
[21:28:42] <ThePendulum> they just sent us a new modem and the people at the service desk had no idea why, they thought we asked for it
[21:29:08] <ThePendulum> I don't know why we got a gigabit modem despite not having any gigabit internet available in this area
[21:30:27] <joepie91> this again sounds entirely like Ziggo
[21:30:30] <joepie91> :P
[21:31:14] <ThePendulum> the old modem was a pile of hot garbage so I was quite excited, but this one has the same useless 'user friendly' interface
[21:32:52] <ThePendulum> it's incredible how much slower it is than the fairly technical cisco modem we used to have for over a decade before these white magic boxes
[21:33:03] <ThePendulum> the ui that is, the connection itself is okay

[23:36:50] <evilgohan2> Seriously
[23:37:34] <evilgohan2> I burned out on CoD. Between the racist shitheads, toxic as hell players (I suppose those two aren't mutually exclusive), and the extreme meta gameplay, I'm done. I uninstalled that bloated mess months ago.
[23:37:51] <evilgohan2> I went back to Battlefield 4. It's actually been rather enjoyable,

[23:44:00] <skye0_mobile> evilgohan2 i dislike the shit release schedule which deliberately fragments players (not buying vanguard nor BOCW, they should take some of those things live service already outside of warzone), but i hate thinking and dying a lot (or once per session) in shooter games. splitgate's great but i suck at it. at least it's easier or something to mute other players since MW2019
[23:44:32] <skye0_mobile> i'd love to play bf4 but because of Williams' death IDK if I want to be reminded of it or something for the time being
[23:45:07] <skye0_mobile> i almost always avoid meta weapons simply because i can sometimes get lazy with them
[23:46:03] <skye0_mobile> evilgohan2 battlefield 4 and battlefield 2042 are apparently gonna use the same version of frostbite, the only thing differentiating them aesthetically and functionally outside of gameplay are texture and map sizes and AI
[23:59:10] <evilgohan2> Irish is only limited to BF4 Single Player
[23:59:27] <evilgohan2> Multiplayer has no reference - unless his presence in the game at all gives you pause.
