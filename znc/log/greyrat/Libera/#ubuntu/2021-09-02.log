I'm trying to set up an encrypted disk on an OpenStack cloud VM, and I can get it working with linux-generic but not with the default linux-kvm. It can't find the module in /lib/modules/5.4.0-1045-kvm/, and I can't seem to find what package would provide that. Thanks!

[04:06:33] <casper34> Well trying to get away from docker because I have been really diapointed with them waiting to email users to after their chages has taken affect, so looking for a way to run multiple instances of a aplication to then get everything back to babe bone
[04:06:51] <leftyfb> babe none?
[04:07:12] <casper34> so I will have find a way to run 3 instances of nginx
[04:07:36] <sarnold> casper34: ah; that sounds like kubernetes or lxd territory, depending upon what you're trying to do
[04:07:41] <casper34> sorry miss spelling ( bare bone ) as in non containortized
[04:07:42] <leftyfb> casper34: you know you can use virtual hosts on nginx right?
[04:07:53] <Max-P> Do you *need* to run 3 independant instances of nginx? You should be able to just throw all of your configs together and it would just work
[04:08:00] <genii-away> set it's conf file to however many instances
[04:08:11] <genii-away> hm
[04:08:15] <casper34> yes but nginx does not allow to set user permissions per vhost
[04:08:29] <leftyfb> casper34: user permission?
[04:08:34] <Bashing-om> casper34: snap packing ? nginxrtmp-minsikl  0.1      minsikl .
[04:08:36] <casper34> and each instance needs its own file perssions
[04:08:44] <Max-P> why?
[04:09:11] <leftyfb> casper34: you can point the document root to a users home directory, add the user to a web group and you're done
[04:09:46] <casper34> security. I do not have 2 sites rummimg as the same user because if a site would be hacked then there could be infections on multiple sites
[04:09:50] <Max-P> nginx's user doesn't have to match, it just needs to have read permission. You can set things to be readable to the www-data group, or you can use ACLs to give www-data read permissions where it needs to
[04:10:05] <Max-P> nginx doesn't run dynamic content so that's not a concern
[04:10:26] <leftyfb> casper34: if you're looking for that sort of security then you want containers. Either docker or lxd
[04:10:46] <casper34> well they do. like everytime I have tried to only change it in the php-fpm it always fails because nginx then looses access
[04:11:25] <Max-P> Anyway if you _really_ want to do that, you can copy over /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service to /etc/systemd/system/nginx-copy-whatever.service and have 3 nginx services running, but you're better off fixing your permissions instead
[04:11:26] <casper34> well docker is a no go with them changing ToS and waiting to email people about it to after
[04:11:48] <Max-P> I have multiple servers with multiple PHP pools all on the same nginx no problem
[04:12:11] <casper34> or in this point it were their subsciption that I were a part of and still they waited to after
[04:12:16] <Max-P> You need to make sure nginx has permission to access the PHP sockets, and the files, but that doesn't have to grant PHP anything to the other sites

[04:16:15] <Max-P> PHP with pools for user1, user2, user3. All static content readable by group www-data, all PHP sockets read-write by www-data (so nginx can serve static content, and call PHP for the rest). user1-3 with no access to www-data, so they can't talk or interact with eachother
[04:16:36] <casper34> If I use the systemd copy method btw woudnt it then be a pain to update versions and patch the system
[04:17:05] <Max-P> Unless the systemd unit changes drastically, not really. You'd pretty much just be duplicating the service definition, not the package itself
[04:17:44] <Max-P> Or if you really want to stay as close as possible to the docker solution, check podman maybe
[04:17:54] <casper34> Oh then it would not work because it needs everything behind

[04:20:15] <casper34> tbh after this with docker and onter things were things have changed within short notice or none ( not related to this case ), my plan is to get as far away for containeraization as posible because of rules could change from one day to another and I would be in the same issue again

[04:24:25] <Max-P> In that case the easiest for you might be to just make lxd containers: it's basically just VMs but without the overhead of a full VM. You'd effectively just be dropping the "container management" layer that docker provides on top as well as the prebuilt-images from docker-hub. So you install Ubuntu as usual and manage it like an actual Ubuntu

[05:08:53] <yates> is there something for any package, installed or not?

[05:09:23] <yates> Croran: soy ou've managed to live without this feature for 13 years?!?
[05:09:52] <Croran> hmmm well... ubuntu has a built-in thing.
[05:10:01] <yates> what?
[05:10:06] <Croran> if you try to start a binary that isn't on your system it automatically tells you which package has it.
[05:10:23] <sarnold> that only works for executables though
[05:10:25] <Croran> and i've used dpkg -S to look up info on files that are actually on my system
[05:10:25] <sarnold> handy though :)
[05:10:48] <Croran> so yeah. i've lived without that specific functionality i guess. i've used google to find package information on ubuntu's repo sites.

[08:36:26] <tsapien> Wow I thought one of the upsides tot he XPS was that it was upgradable RAM wise
[08:36:35] <Croran> memtest86+ is still relevant. it's completely independent of linux. essentially it's own OS.
[08:37:04] <Croran> that will tell you 99% whether you truly have a ram issue.
[08:37:17] <rob> OK, cool. So I'll boot from the image, run that and see what happens.

[12:13:00] <sator> Hi, I'm considering to switch from LTS to interim; I've read the official wiki about the Ubuntu life cycle and also tens of articles here and there on internet about LTS vs interim but still I have a doubt about security when using an interim version for everyday activities. As most of the users (I think), 90% of installed software on my LTS box is
[12:13:01] <sator> coming from "main", the remaining 10% from "universe", so I'm bit concerned about the statement that interim releases only get security supports on "main". Does this mean that upgrades in "universe" for a interim might be unsafe or become a security issue? Can someone shed a bit of light on this topic?

[12:15:51] <alkisg> It means that if a package in universe has a known security issue and a fix for it, the fix may land on the LTS version but not on the non-LTS version
[12:16:08] <alkisg> For example, see some security issues there: https://ubuntu.com/security/notices
[12:16:50] <pevoz23> Croran: I'm not really able to answer, but quite at an early stage I would say. I just see a message "x86/cpu sgx disabled by bios, then a result from fsck on the root partition, after that it seems to enter a loop of the same messages (mainly related to talpa vfshook, i.e. related to the sophos AV).

[12:25:21] <pevoz23> alkisg That could indeed very much be. I'll give that a try. I was actually more worried that a kernel update went wrong, as yesterday evening I came home and had no video signal out of the pc (it was running on the HWE kernel, so I guess already 5.11.x, where x<25or 27) and had to do a hard reset. However, then I sudo apt --reinstall'ed the latest
[12:25:21] <pevoz23> kernel with no better results. So i guess it could indeed be something related to sophos (and, if not, probably to nvidia)
[12:25:28] <user123> With multilib support this error
[12:25:35] <alkisg> shortyy: it has a lot of information there, code, bugs etc, it's not just package information, so it can be a bit confusing
[12:25:43] <sator> @alkisg: ah! So for LTS, if a package has a known security issue and a fix for it, the fix is provided immediately as update. Does it means that some "universe" packages for LTS 20 might be more updated than the same for LTS 21?
[12:25:52] <Croran> pevoz23: your system might not be booting to the point where it can write any logs. I think there's a way to boot your system to a serial output and log from another system.

[14:06:44] <supremekai> alkisg, thanks! So I can add a swap file too
[14:07:20] <supremekai> I'm kind of worried to mess it up, upon trying to assign more space to the swap partition
[14:07:25] <supremekai> I have no unallocated space
[14:07:27] <alkisg> Yes, although in some cases it doesn't make sense to add a whole lot of swap, it may not help as much as you think it will

[14:08:17] <alkisg> supremekai: yeah, swap doesn't make things faster. It makes things that are about to crash (out of ram), go slow instead
[14:08:19] <supremekai> I tried gparted, but I don't have unallocated space available

[14:09:55] <supremekai> How much RAM?
[14:09:59] <Croran> 16gb
[14:10:19] <supremekai> idk I guess I installed too much bs from that snap store upon that shopping *free* spree
[14:10:31] <supremekai> I looked like one of those coupon ladies at the supermarket
[14:10:52] <Croran> what do snaps have to do with swap?
[14:10:57] <alkisg> Croran: the best nvme is order of magnitudes slower than ram, but that's not the main point; the point is that ram paging makes programs slower because they can't access their data directly
[14:11:24] <supremekai> Croran, I have too much apps running in the background, but no time to check it and clean it up
[14:11:28] <alkisg> `a = x[1]` needs one CPU instruction; paging needs millions of them

[14:12:24] <Croran> alkisg: i'm aware nvme is a lot slower than ram. my point is that in the past swap often let you stop a crashing application before it ate all your swap space. today it is less likely to serve that purpose.

[14:13:12] <alkisg> Croran: it's still an issue. systemd-oom is planned to try to help against crashes, so that only programs are closed instead of the OS crashing. But it's not "there" yet.
[14:13:36] <supremekai> I work with a lot of heavy stuff so it's always crashing up
[14:13:49] <ogra> how is it crshing exactly ... 8GB + 1GB swap seems fine, you should identify the apps that cause issues instead

[14:14:45] <alkisg> Croran: of course. E.g. you have 8 gb ram, you try to do something in gimp with a big image, it temporarily needs 12 gb => swap will be used instead of crashing
[14:15:04] <alkisg> There's no difference in that concept based on nvme, rotational or other storage technology

[14:31:11] <Croran> lavaball: have you looked in the printer properties from the printers panel?
[14:31:27] <lavaball> not yet.
[14:32:21] <Croran> lavaball: i think you'll find something relevant in the 'job options -> other options' section, though i only have a monochrome printer so your experience may differ.

[15:46:24] <bobdobbs> I think this might be the result of stuff I don't understand, related to how some of these tools install themselves in hidden folders in the home directory, and then install aliases to themselves... somewhere

[17:18:39] <FNAShinobi> Running 20.04 and every day or two I have to disable my wifi and then enable it again because the speed goes down to 4Mbs. I usually get 100 Mbs from the wifi on this machine. As soon as I do that wifi re-enable it's back to 100 Mbs. Anyone have any ideas on what the problem may be?

[17:27:26] <rbasak> FNAShinobi: sounds like a driver or firmware issue. These things are usually specific to your particular hardware.
[17:27:38] <rbasak> It might also be an unfortunate interaction with your particular wifi access point.

[17:32:08] <rbasak> FNAShinobi: note that I said _interaction_ with the access point. It's hard to pin an issue down to a specific bug in a particular device without some very time consuming debugging. But it's quite common to find that two different devices won't speak to each other well, but each device individually works with everything else.

[17:33:50] <rbasak> I can't answer your question about drivers. It depends on your specific hardware and what is available. Usually it's a route to trouble to be installing drivers from third party sources, though of course in your case it may be necessary to fix the issue. We'd prefer to fix the drivers that we ship.
[17:34:55] <rbasak> One other relatively easy route to work around a wifi issue is to get a USB wifi adapter that is supported well by Linux. For example most stuff that supports a "Raspberry Pi" will work well.

And out of curiosity, I will make one partition for Ubuntu, so that will count as another primary partition. But when configuring ubuntu (when making the root, swap, home partition), that would be sub-partition of the "primary partition ubuntu"?
