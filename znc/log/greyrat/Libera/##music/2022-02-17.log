[04:50:31] <TomatoSynth> piercedwater, i mean the usual places. discogs to start, ebay but i don't recommend it, and also vinylonm
[04:50:54] <TomatoSynth> your locals include thrift shops, and hitting up craiglist for the occasional diamond find
[04:51:14] <piercedwater> :o 
[04:51:34] <piercedwater> checking out vinylom atm. also didn't think of cl and thrift shops. ty
[04:52:25] <TomatoSynth> i have plethora of local vinyl
[04:52:44] <TomatoSynth> and i'd say less than 3% is for me, its a bunch of shit, i'm honestly thankful for the net
[04:53:38] <TomatoSynth> its a bunch of dad rock. that kinda thing does well for the turds in this town. occasional good hip hop find, almost no e music and prices are /sometimes/ steeper than online, its ridiculous.
[04:55:14] <piercedwater> i don't think there are many turds around here thankfully! :D but, there is a vinyl shop down the road i haven't tried since the net isn't hookin' me up
[04:55:32] <piercedwater> wooo i might actually go outside :o
[04:57:01] <TomatoSynth> are you in the us? what is your average price for a single, new lp in yr area??
[04:57:41] <piercedwater> yeah, usa. not sure of the avg price because all the vinyl i have, which is only 3 records, i have bought off the net. actually bought a new one off of ebay lol
