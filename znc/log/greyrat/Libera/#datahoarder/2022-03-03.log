[00:52:03] <linearbit> Currently would you say that btrfs or ZFS is a better option for a simple 2 disc raid 1 array?
[00:58:25] <rawktucc> btrfs is pretty simple
[00:58:28] <rawktucc> https://nitter.eu/Bandcamp/status/1499068917947510788
[00:58:33] <rawktucc> holy fucking cringe compilation

[01:03:10] <linearbit> rawktucc, yeah I think the question is whether btrfs issues would warrant going to ZFS
[01:03:26] <rawktucc> skye0, except a lot of music is ONLY on bandcamp
[01:03:31] <rawktucc> so you're not directly supporting epic games
[01:03:41] <rawktucc> there's at least 10 albums i want to buy on bandcamp friday, which is this friday I think
[01:03:47] <rawktucc> but yeesh after this aquisition
[01:03:54] <rawktucc> linearbit, i think most of the "issues" with btrfs are raid5/6
[01:04:09] <rawktucc> and everything else is... stable as far as I can tell. but im not too familiar with zfs or btrfs on that in-depth of a level
[01:04:14] <skye0> the end of DRM-free is nigh
[01:04:19] * skye0 looks for some alcohol
[01:04:38] <rawktucc> no, i think it will stay drm-free, the problem is just the storefronts for actual indie and indepenent art expression is dying further
[01:04:57] <linearbit> rawktucc, hmm I guess in that case I'll just go with btrfs
[01:05:01] <skye0> ok
[01:05:14] <rawktucc> if it's not a critical system linearbit then I don't see any reason not to, btrfs is pretty simple to use
[01:05:36] <linearbit> It's going to be my main ways of archival
[01:05:41] <rawktucc> oh
[01:05:44] <skye0> heard good things about BTRFS but forgot, mostly remember hearing that ZFS is superior but Linux barely had support for it
[01:05:50] <rawktucc> yeah that's the one thing
[01:06:02] <skye0> and i'm pissed for one or two reasons, one of which being that my eBay order for some clothing ended up being incorrect
[01:06:14] <rawktucc> it'd be nice for people to be able to just say "buy my album" and you can: send cash in mail, buy physical media, buy digital album (which artist or someone emails)
[01:06:37] <rawktucc> I think there needs to be just, bandcamp basic. as in, super simple storefronts and payment through stuff like Stripe, Paypal, crypto maybe...

[21:20:04] <skye0> ThePendulum my father is against the legalization of weed beyond medical purposes
[21:20:33] <skye0> evilgohan2 wtf was this about?
[21:25:52] <evilgohan2> I wish that person hadn't deleted their account. It had all the context.
[21:26:31] <evilgohan2> Texas House legislative candidate Jeff Younger decided to stop by University of North Texas.
[21:26:40] <evilgohan2> Said candidate is far-right anti-trans
[21:26:52] <evilgohan2> and calls for locking up parents of trans kids (and much worse).
[21:27:08] <evilgohan2> So the students let him know their opinion.
[21:27:19] <evilgohan2> Fun fact: on his way out, he and his police escort ran over a protestor.
[21:28:06] <skye0> ah
[21:28:27] <skye0> a lot of people still lump trans people and pedophiles together for one
[21:28:45] <skye0> which is part of how and why the whole thing is gaining traction if not religious viewpoints
[21:28:55] <evilgohan2> yeah, I doubt a 9 year old is a pedophile.
[21:29:05] <evilgohan2> But that's what they're pushing.
[21:29:06] <skye0> "think of the children"
[21:29:43] <evilgohan2> If a 9 year old says they're trans, Texas now requires that to be mandatorally reported and requires the seizure of those kids from parents.
[21:29:49] <evilgohan2> Because... you know... freedom.
[21:29:58] <skye0> "freedom in christ"
[21:30:29] <skye0> thing is my sister talked about her non-binary friend. my father didn't exactly take it well but did at least acknowledge people have their own beliefs. said non-binary friend was never religious too

[22:11:27] *** Joins: imMute (~immute@user/immute)
[22:12:47] <skye0> at least 30 or so years old, or even their forties
[22:13:00] <evilgohan2> Probably not inaccurate.
[22:13:43] <skye0> if they were old enough to have at least known about the original doom games (first one came out in like 1992), they're likely too old for me to hang around and easily relate to
[22:14:53] <skye0> i admit that i also want a space where i can talk about lewd crap on occasion. speaking of, i've been wondering briefly about adult games
[22:15:20] <evilgohan2> I'm gonna say this: I don't know what moderation policies with regards to such are here now
[22:15:28] <evilgohan2> but this place hasn't shied away from that in the past
