[12:14:50] <ridcully_> sobel: regarding sql-dialects: i guess i have misunderstood the question then.  i thought you wanted it to make easier to parameterize the building of queries in regard of their parts (e.g. add where clauses at runtime).  for the dialects the DSL part imho is still relevant.  e.g. honeysql allows you to specify the dialect

[19:21:12] <sobel> are AF_UNIX sockets really a jdk16+ thing?
[19:21:40] <Para> It is a very new feature afaik, yeah.
[19:21:51] <Para> There's some terrible libraries for it which I've never managed to get working.
[19:22:38] <sobel> yeah, i was just in some disbelief that apps needing local sockets had to use JNA-based 3rd party libs in 2021
[19:24:19] <Para> If I had to guess, it's one of those things JDK refused for ages to add because there were no useful cross-platform semantics to extract so that they could uniformly support all major OSes (Windows obviously being the outlier here)
[19:26:54] <sobel> agreed
[19:27:10] <sobel> i've read a JEP for it and it references that issue in multiple places
[19:28:04] <sobel> that said, they support serial ports
[19:29:55] <ridcully_> the part in the history here, that really confused me: given that sun back then made most of the monies from selling unix boxen, that is was not there at least for some platforms
[19:30:43] <Para> Even weirder is that they didn't support BSD jails right from the get-go.
[19:31:26] <Para> Could've been a runtime feature of JDK on Solaris or something like that.

[20:03:26] <technomancy> sandra: haha yesss love it
[20:04:12] <sandra> :)
[20:04:38] <technomancy> sandra: at one point I rearranged the letters on mine so it read "DVORA KLMAO" across the top
[20:04:45] <sandra> hahaha
[20:05:38] <sandra> You had 2×A and 2×O as one does
[20:06:24] <technomancy> actually I think I used upside-down V as the second A and Q as the second O
[20:06:59] <Para> #landlordhacks
[20:07:00] <sandra> LMɅQ
[20:07:13] <Para> Be the letter you want to be.
[20:07:53] <sandra> I needed to shift the bottom row one left on dvorak. Split dvoraks that put the X on the left is not my steez
[20:08:02] <sandra> Uh, shift it one right I mean
[20:09:03] <Para> I've worked with two people who had all black keyboards. One of them was even completely square.
[20:09:29] <technomancy> https://photos.app.goo.gl/LAfsbkoKaE8c62zy9 <- current arrangement
[20:09:57] <sandra> I was on an all-blank before. In the background of this picture: https://idiomdrottning.org/special-friend.jpg
[20:10:46] <technomancy> that one above is actually the first one to have labels I've owned since 2011, ignoring internal laptop ones
[20:10:50] <sandra> technomancy: Nice font. Is that arrangement somewhat reflective of the actual layout
[20:11:00] <sandra> Wait, hack lane
[20:11:01] <sandra> no
[20:11:05] <sandra> ♥
[20:11:06] <sandra> Hack planet
[20:11:19] <Para> The statement at the top is very inclusive as well.
[20:11:32] <sandra> Oh, so you can turn them 90°
[20:11:54] <technomancy> yeah, one advantage of cherry mount over alps
[20:12:57] <sandra> I'm gonna turn the key below the B 90° clockwise and the key below the N 90° counterclockwise
[20:13:00] <sandra> I need a square root key
[20:13:39] <sandra> On mine, the letters are where they are now. So I lose out on the "people can't type" level of "security"
[20:16:38] <sandra> The UFO-themed ones are way difficulter to pull off than the original latin ones which sometimes even fall off
[20:17:03] <technomancy> is that the linear A set?
[20:17:27] <sandra> That's right
[20:18:40] <technomancy> sweet
[20:19:12] <sandra> I would've gotten just the linear A instead of a mix but I already had the latin since those was the only ones available at first
[20:20:08] <sandra> I wanted the Linear A because my layout became a bit confusing to myself. Like, I don't have an enter or a tab for example since I use ctrl-I and ctrl-M
[20:21:14] <sandra> I'm somewhat easily self-confusable
[20:21:14] <technomancy> yeah you can create a much more efficient layout if you make certain assumptions about the machine it's plugging into =) my first layout (when it was just for me and no one else used it) had no arrow keys.
[20:22:06] <sandra> I have a fake Ctrl that's actually a layer switcher that sets Ctrl P to actual up, Ctrl A to actual home etc, while still keeping classics like ctrl c, ctrl q, ctrl x etc as they are
[20:22:30] <sandra> Both my lower-left-corner and lower-right-corner is that key
[20:22:31] <technomancy> I've always been curious as to how that works in practice
[20:22:56] <technomancy> like ... it makes sense but it feels like it might have some weird edge cases
[20:22:59] <sandra> When I do need real ctrl-p, like printing PDFs or whatever, I need to hold down compose (the butterfly)
