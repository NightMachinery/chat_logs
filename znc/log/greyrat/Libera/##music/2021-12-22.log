[02:08:40] <MusicalDillo> Haven't read the article yet in fact
[02:08:49] <MusicalDillo> but it looks interesting
[02:09:03] <MusicalDillo> "MIDI stands for “Musical Instrument Digital Interface” and, after 37 years, it has finally received a major update. MIDI 2.0 is live, and it could mean the end of the keyboard’s dominance over popular music."
[02:12:18] <macrobat> higher resolution
[02:12:32] <MusicalDillo> much
[02:12:34] <macrobat> better midi violins?
[02:12:43] <murthy> MusicalDillo: two days back I was listening to a midi sound file and it was like listening to a recording. I was wondering why instrumental music are not sold via midi files
[02:12:49] <MusicalDillo> "It means that instead of 128 steps for features like volume, there will now be billions."
[02:13:02] <murthy> probably because of harmonics and stuff?
[02:13:18] <murthy> awesome
[02:13:23] <MusicalDillo> macrobat> better midi violins? << I met people with MIDI violins in the 80s

I was wondering why instrumental music are not sold via midi files << There's something called the General MIDI spec that allows capable software and instruments to play music files
[02:17:16] <MusicalDillo> The drums are always on Channel 10, for example

[02:18:42] <murthy> nice
[02:19:01] <MusicalDillo> it can be done in computer software as well
[02:19:17] <MusicalDillo> Apple Computers have that capability built-n
[02:19:19] <murthy> MusicalDillo: I used vlc with a sound font to play a midi file
[02:19:27] <MusicalDillo> cool
[02:19:43] <murthy> but I want to know why music is not sold as midi file
[02:20:03] <murthy> like you can sell Beethoven's music as midi right?
[02:20:57] <MusicalDillo> The thing is, while the instruments are all mapped out in GM, it's not necessarily the same sounds in playback
[02:21:20] <MusicalDillo> so you wouldn't be guaranteed to hear the original performance sonically
[02:21:27] <MusicalDillo> it's just an instrument map
[02:21:56] *** Quits: SteppenwolfVM (~miau@user/steppenwolfvm) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[02:22:16] <MusicalDillo> a drum or horn in the GM file would sound different depending on which GM playback system you were using
[02:22:43] <MusicalDillo> but it would always be that drum or that horn as defined by the GM spec
[02:22:46] <murthy> Ya I can understand the sound font mapping stuff. But imagine the dynamics
[02:23:16] <MusicalDillo> The dynamics would be preserved, just not the tone of the voice playing it
[02:23:37] <murthy> what if the sound font is also sold with the midi?

[05:23:13] <artao> but like ... between the TVA and He Who Remains/Kang and the eternals with the celestials and what's-his-name ....
[05:23:15] <artao> huh?
[05:23:44] <artao> sooo .... the TVA could still "prune" what's his name .. Ashair or something .. or any celestials or eternals or deviants or whatever
[05:24:00] <artao> they're still all on the same timeline "managed" by TVA right?
[05:24:25] <artao> soooo ..... Ashair (whatever) and the celestials don't /really/ have as much influence as they think
[05:24:40] <artao> so many fuckin deity-wannabes in the MCU LOL

[06:18:19] <LibertyDillo> yeah, but a pretty serious catamaran 
[06:18:22] <Ultros> wouldnt fish from it or sail it to the south seas but for a lake it's fun
[06:18:26] <artao> i saw it in theater. discounted theater thankfully. 2nd or 3rd run sort of thing
[06:19:10] <artao> it's fun getting those tiny sailboards up sideways ... until you get the daggerboard out of the water and flip over and gotta flip the boat back over and get back on it ......
