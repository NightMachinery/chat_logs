[00:23:21] <sysRPL> are there any good javascript coders in this channel?
[00:23:41] <sysRPL> i have this problem. i am trying to create a page that loads various 3d models based on query strings in the url, but all browsers are blocking it with the error message "lights-power-all.stl?height=420&width=800:1 Failed to execute 'write' on 'Document': It isn't possible to write into a document from an asynchronously-loaded external script unless it is explicitly opened."

[00:25:05] <sysRPL> but am having this problem where if i build the script element dynamically i get errors from both firefox and chrome
[00:25:05] <bomb> I think you should use the Fetch API to access that file

[00:27:48] <sysRPL> if i switch to let s = document.createElement("script"); s.src = "whatever"; it fails
[00:27:51] <bomb> yeah it loads fine here
[00:27:55] <sysRPL> right
[00:28:51] <sysRPL> but if i try to build the script src dynamically i get this error ... Failed to execute 'write' on 'Document': It isn't possible to write into a document from an asynchronously-loaded external script unless it is explicitly opened."
[00:29:30] <bomb> how do you do that dynamically?
[00:29:42] <sysRPL> that is, let s = document.createElement("script"); s.src = myurl; document.body.AppendChild(s);

[00:30:01] <bomb> ah

[00:31:52] <sysRPL> it works with the same url ... jsut not in a dynamically create element
[00:32:27] <sysRPL> i guess i can fix it by building the page html on the server
[00:32:34] <sysRPL> instead of in javascript
[00:32:40] <bomb> nah we need to solve this

[02:30:28] <JakeSays> bomb: it doesn't
[02:30:43] <JakeSays> well, not in the traditional sense.
[02:30:51] <JakeSays> dart has what are called isolates
[02:31:04] <bomb> mhm?
[02:31:47] <JakeSays> an isolate is like a mini runtime instance. the only way for two isolates to interact is via message passing, iirc
[02:32:10] <bomb> how's that different than green threads?
[02:32:16] <bomb> aka coroutines
[02:32:53] <JakeSays> co-routines are cooperative. isolates aren't
[02:34:11] <bomb> alright, so it's like event-thread, but provides a syntactic isolation
[02:34:20] <bomb> but when you crunch number in one of them, it would block the entire app
[02:34:44] <JakeSays> why would it block the entire app?

[11:03:11] <ern> Are you sure it's your kestrel that answer 400 then?
[11:03:35] <ern> Sometimes something else can answer and linger around on the ports
[11:04:51] <benl90> yes, because when I stop the dotnet run, it will not reply to my request

[19:04:59] <MatthiasVance> Looking into how to create a parser that will return intermediate results at every "run"
[19:05:32] <MatthiasVance> Like when you are parsing JSON you can tell a few things when reading just the first 100kb but if it's a 1GB file maybe you don't want to read all that?
[19:05:36] <MatthiasVance> Or at least not wait for it
[19:09:47] *** Quits: kenantu (~kenanmara@user/kenanmarasli) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:09:50] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: like using a JsonTextReader :P
[19:10:16] <MatthiasVance> The input part is easy :p
[19:10:31] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: what's he hard part?
[19:10:33] <MatthiasVance> Maybe I should just yield the current state
[19:10:41] <MatthiasVance> Until the sequence is done
[19:10:43] *** Joins: kenanmarasli (~kenanmara@user/kenanmarasli)
[19:11:26] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: I am just brainstorming how to approach creating a schema from JSON.. solving the actual JSON -> schema is not hard, but I am wondering how to deal with large files etc
[19:13:08] *** redj_ is now known as redj
[19:13:16] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: i mean, to deserialize json in a streaming fashion you can just use JsonTextReader, if the input is newline delimited json, then you can just trivially read one line at a time as json, otherwise you can navigate the JsonTextReader manually and call Deserialize<T>(reader) inbetween to deserialize a piece of json
[19:13:57] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: Yeah there is also JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsyncEnumerable()
[19:14:22] <MatthiasVance> Also one element might still be huuuuuge
[19:14:31] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: in STJ, yeah
[19:15:49] <MatthiasVance> So you're right in that case a reader might make more sense
[19:16:33] <MatthiasVance> And every time I read a piece I could update the model and yield it
[19:16:38] <MatthiasVance> That's actually pretty cool
[19:17:05] <MatthiasVance> Updating the model = creating a new immutable instance :D
[19:17:22] <bomb> mmm models
[19:17:32] <sysRPN> hey bomb
[19:17:42] <MatthiasVance> Where's sysRPM?
[19:17:50] <sysRPN> i found this itneresting 3d model viewer tool with a lot of options and it's open source

[19:18:14] <sysRPN> https://3dviewer.net/index.html#model=assets/models/car.glb
[19:18:44] <sysRPN> also i had to write a new page class in ym c# framework to get my existing 3d assembly viewer to work
[19:19:04] <bomb> look cool. uses threejs
[19:19:12] <sysRPN> check out the class definition -> https://www.getlazarus.org/design/#page_class
[19:19:26] <sysRPN> ^ that's how my custom web framework works ^
[19:20:30] <bomb> interesting. I thought you're using FPC for web dev too
[19:20:36] <sysRPN> hell no
[19:21:01] <sysRPN> i have been telling the fpc ppl for years using native code for a web framework is moronic
[19:21:19] <sysRPN> imo c# is great for console apps and web apps
[19:21:36] <bomb> what's wrong about it? Go is doing fine
[19:21:38] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Did'nt serilog add some way to register enrichers and sinks through DI?
[19:21:47] <sysRPN> and if it ever had a decent cross platform ui toolkit, i'd use c# for desktop apps as well
[19:21:56] <Suchiman> Nasp: possibly
[19:22:09] <Nasp> Like all things serilog i just dont think it's documented
[19:22:16] <Nasp> I just kinda have that need now
[19:22:20] <bomb> sysRPN what's wrong with AOT compiling for web apps?
[19:22:36] <sysRPN> though free pascal is the best language for integration with native code libraries
[19:22:47] <Suchiman> Nasp: https://github.com/serilog/serilog-aspnetcore#two-stage-initialization there it uses ReadFrom.Services
[19:23:41] <Nasp> Ahh it's in the Asp package
[19:23:44] <Nasp> Thank you
[19:24:16] <sysRPN> also, i am starting the design of my open source pen plotter / laser etcher hardware
[19:26:14] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: Hm the Utf8JsonReader doesn't do streams =/
[19:34:30] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: yeah it doesn't support doing IO at all, you need to basically give it a chunk of memory, start reading, and then once you've run out of buffer, read more and reinit the serializer with the previous state

[19:50:35] <MatthiasVance> (and skip allocating too much memory)
[19:50:57] <MatthiasVance> I think I am overthinking this, let's first have an implementation and then see where it breaks :D

[20:02:59] <MaNa2k> i guess im strugling mostly with the mvvm bit
[20:03:12] <bomb> MaNa2k any reason you have to do it using .NET & C#?
[20:03:25] <bomb> you can use Flutter, Kotlin/Java with Android SDK
[20:03:27] <MaNa2k> bomb, not really, just because i know the language.
[20:03:31] <irwiss> there's like a billion tutorials on mvvm, including ones for xamarin
[20:03:51] <bomb> MaNa2k I'm slowly learning Flutter, and Dart feels like I already know the language
[20:04:09] <MaNa2k> bomb, i tried getting into kotlin with android studio, dont think it was for me
[20:04:20] <irwiss> tbh kotlin is crap
[20:04:23] <bomb> ^
[20:04:35] <bomb> both Kotlin and Android SDK are terrible, IMHO
[20:04:43] <MaNa2k> hmm
[20:04:50] <bomb> that's why Google's pushing Flutter lately. they'll replace Android with Fuchsia
[20:04:57] <irwiss> yep, android sdk is worse than winapi, which is an amazing achievement
[20:05:06] <MaNa2k> so whats flutter? a languge ?=
[20:05:07] <bomb> they rewrote some of their apps from Kotlin to Flutter
[20:05:21] <MaNa2k> looks like something for ios
[20:05:22] <MaNa2k> apps
[20:05:23] <bomb> https://flutter.dev/
[20:05:37] <bomb> supports iOS, Windows, Linux, macOS too

[21:17:18] <xb0o2> And you should *always* be ensuring that disposables are disposed.
[21:17:45] <bomb> so, should I install the Flutter dev environment on Linux partition or Windows?
[21:17:52] <bomb> I have graphics and audio apps in Windows
[21:17:57] <Suchiman> bomb: on your mac partition
[21:18:06] <bomb> but I have backend devtools on Linux
[21:18:14] <bomb> Suchiman my Macbook sucks TBH
[21:20:13] <xb0o2> Buy a new one
[21:20:27] <bomb> never again
[21:26:03] <bomb> sooo
[21:26:05] <xb0o2> sooo
[21:26:20] <bomb> Flutter is used by Toyota in-car screens
[21:26:22] <bomb> RIP Qt
[21:26:51] <bomb> https://youtu.be/zSbsIiluixw?t=1987
[21:26:56] <xb0o2> Why is that interesting to you?
[21:28:18] <bomb> Qt makes money from automotive industry
[21:28:24] <bomb> no money, no Qt
[21:28:30] <bomb> no Qt, no several apps that I use
[21:30:17] <xb0o2> Interesting
[21:30:28] <xb0o2> Sounds a bit extreme
[21:30:52] *** Joins: DoofusCanadensis (~DoofusCan@2604:3d09:47c:f970::fb)
[21:31:08] <bomb> yeah. but Flutter can actually eat a bit of Qt's lunch there
[21:31:50] <bomb> Android for Cars caught some interest, but Android is a terrible platform.
[21:32:51] <xb0o2> I don't care, at all, for any of it.
[21:33:03] <xb0o2> Infotainment systems in cars I mean.
[21:33:26] <bomb> yeah, they're distracting
[21:33:38] <xb0o2> It's just irrelevant bollocks forced into things for the sake of profit.
[21:33:40] <bomb> just good ol radio or CD player would work for me
[21:33:50] <bomb> yup
[21:34:03] <xb0o2> My car needs to become a computer. My washing machine needs wifi. My chainsaw needs bluetooth.
[21:34:26] <bomb> there is an episode about smart fridges on Silicon Valley
[21:34:45] <xb0o2> My washing machine needs to be a thing with a pump and a motor.
[21:35:01] <xb0o2> Sensors to improve the efficiency of the thing? Great.
[21:35:17] <xb0o2> General purpose CPUs and wifi connectivity? Nah, I'm good.
[21:35:58] <bomb> fuck you IoT
[21:36:21] <MaNa2k> oki, maui seems easier to use then the xamarin.forms
[21:36:28] <xb0o2> IoT is wank.
[21:36:31] <xb0o2> Quote me on it.
[21:37:04] <MaNa2k> all the bullshit routing stuff happens in the backgroun
[21:37:25] <MaNa2k> kind of reminds me of blazor
[21:38:43] <bomb> I hope you won't regret it MaNa2k
[21:39:07] <MaNa2k> well, im just making something for my selv. will be a nice learning experiance
[21:39:25] <MaNa2k> + xaml knowlage wont go to waste
[21:39:49] <Suchiman> MaNa2k: so you're saying the maui fork of xamarin.forms improved that :P ?
[21:39:50] <Suchiman> xD

[21:51:50] <cloudbender> @xb0o2 yeah I made SOME progress by simply calling socket.Dispose(), but I can't figure out why the acceptance callback is firing when no client is ever attempting to connect
[21:54:18] <cloudbender> I stuck  '  if('! allowreceive' bool) return ' into the callback and now all is working well-ish.
[21:54:48] <bomb> xb0o2 screw IoT right in the butt
[21:55:01] <cloudbender> But it makes no sense that the callback is ever invloked when no client is attempting a connection
[21:55:48] <cloudbender> No I need to find out how extra threads are being created.
[21:56:06] <cloudbender> I build 7, but the output window shows me 8 terminating.
[21:57:38] <cloudbender> It's all good.  I need the exercise.
[21:58:34] <MaNa2k> Suchiman, well it seems like they have hidden the mvvm part
[21:58:50] <MaNa2k> it happens magically by roslyn i think
[22:00:02] <MaNa2k> is seems like this does that magic Microsoft.Maui.Controls.SourceGen.dll
[22:01:04] <MaNa2k> when you create a new maui app, it talkes like 100MB of size
