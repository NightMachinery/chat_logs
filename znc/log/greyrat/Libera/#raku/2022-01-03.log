[14:48:21] <El_Che> While I love Latin, I think that in a lot of settings a English to Latin translater may be more handy :P
[14:49:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Someone wrote a converter from Mathematica notebooks to Markdown. I can reprogram or extend that converter to generate Pod6. Alternatively, just use a Markdown-to-Pod6 converter.

[17:02:11] <moon-child> @Anton Antonov I am unconvinced that 'notebooks' are set up well as a _program-writing_ environment
[17:02:21] <moon-child> (though I do admit they have more inherent structure than text)
[17:03:03] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @moon-child Yes, I use Comma (IntelliJ). But often enough for quick scripting I use Atom.
[17:03:05] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @moon-child I was not serious, just referring to a recent publication of mine.
[17:03:30] * holyghost curses the days of his wavelets in mathematica
[17:05:07] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Actually, I developed the original built-in framework for Wavelets in Mathematica. But left Wolfram Research before finishing it and putting it in production.
[17:05:08] <holyghost> on macOS 8.2
[17:05:27] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> @moon-child I use notebooks if I have to do repeated experiments and/or documentation, and/or presentations.
[17:05:31] <moon-child> wavelets?
[17:06:07] <holyghost> moon-child, JPEG2000 lol
[17:06:32] <holyghost> compu$erve
[17:07:26] <holyghost> It's a good compression algorithm AFAIK
[17:07:38] <moon-child> I see
[17:07:54] <discord-raku-bot> <Anton Antonov#7232> Here is an example of experiment with making an org-mode grammar within a Mathematica notebook.
