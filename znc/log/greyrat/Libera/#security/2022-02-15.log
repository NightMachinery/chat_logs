[13:26:03] <spare> they can mitm any connection that isnt encrypted but it would hard drop and be very apparent
[13:26:16] <dpirate> They can manipulate which sites you connect to, which is a problem with protocols that don't check if you're connecting to the right host

[13:29:15] <dpirate> well not safe from governments
[13:29:23] <mhmd> how?

[13:29:36] <mhmd> privacy aspects?
[13:29:44] <dpirate> Cause governments can just demand the certificate from cert authority
[13:29:50] <dpirate> And therefore you're fucked
[13:29:51] <mhmd> aha
[13:29:59] <spare> they get every request you make only the host.domain not the host.domain/i/went/to/this/exact/page.html
[13:30:13] <mhmd> yep
[13:30:25] <spare> if it didnt work and was a threat a lot more shit would be on fire right now
[13:30:53] <dpirate> If you want to be safe with DNS I'd suggest using dnscrypt-proxy or tor + local caching dns
[13:32:00] <piou> Note that not everything is web: even if you trust yourself to always check that you're indeed using HTTPS (many websites connect to HTTP first and then redirect to HTTPS, a mitm there would be pretty difficult to spot in regular web browsing) there are lots of other protocols that use the internet and don't go through a browser (games for example). It can be hard to check that they're properly
[13:32:06] <piou> verifying the host.
[13:32:19] <dpirate> yeah

[13:33:29] <mhmd> I have to use a specific DNS server, mostly for getting images from docker hub, so I was concerned about MITM
[13:33:48] <spare> still doesnt change the fact the dns server doesnt know what port your trying  to connect to, ssh google.com and they would be forced to assume  and return an http request... making it alarmingly obvious someone flipped the eye pee address out
[13:34:17] <piou> mhmd: something like a company DNS for internal images?
[13:34:19] <spare> ^ that one probably doesnt work /shrug but the concepts still the same
[13:34:35] <spare> they have to make an assumption you can pass a false positive to
[13:34:52] <mhmd> piou: yep
[13:35:23] <piou> spare: not really, the DNS server doesn't respond with the request, it can point to a server that has both ssh server and http server and handles both requests gracefully
[13:35:32] <spare> you can do domain fronting as well, one of the chat apps started doing it to avoid censorship in other countries
[13:35:55] <piou> spare: sure if there's an uncommon protocol it can lead to the confusion you're talking about, but that's the exception, not the rule
[13:36:27] <spare> but then it would need to port scan every request i make to fake host what was on the target server ? at which point the timing would be alarmingly slow, i can host the domain and add a 3 second timeout to port 80... so they scan it takes 3 seconds before they can reply and setup a fake server
[13:36:29] <dpirate> I guess when they can manipulate the IP address that is resolved, they can make it so the packets pass by a segment they can sniff and catch on the fly what port/protocol the packets you're sending are destined to.
[13:36:39] <piou> spare: what? No
[13:37:04] <mhmd> spare: it was telegram, I think. It was for a very short rime
[13:37:07] <piou> spare: if you ssh google.com and I give you the address of malicious.net then you're just doing a normal ssh connection to malicious.net, no port scan involved
[13:37:08] <mhmd> time*
[13:37:09] <spare> your a dns server... im hosting my.domain i request it you redirect it to your server... how do you know what ports it hosts ?
[13:37:21] <spare> i already said that example didnt work ?
[13:37:32] <piou> It does though
[13:37:44] <piou> Because you have both a ssh server and a http server on malicious.net
[13:37:54] <piou> there's no "responding with a http request to a ssh demand"
[13:37:54] <spare> and yeh they would have to ? i connect to my.domain knowing im using telnet /shurg on port 1111 do they intercept and host telnet on that port or let it drop ?
[13:38:37] <spare> if they dont know the real server i gave its public ports they cant know if they should fake hosting it or drop it, its an assumption or i can control them checking the real host...
[13:38:54] <dpirate> The port is always cleartext in a packet. Unless you're using a tunnel.
[13:39:06] *** Parts: mhmd (~mhmd@37.48.90.208) (WeeChat 2.7.1)

[13:39:36] <piou> accordilngly

[13:47:37] <piou> Given the number of banks that don't have HSTS I'd say there's a lot to be done on that side. But the thing is, generally you get a corrupt DNS only when, say, the company was attacked and the DNS changed. Getting the user to use your malicious DNSÂ is the hard part
[13:47:41] <piou> Exactly
[13:47:45] <dpirate> It all depends on the threat model

[13:50:14] <piou> Just as it's easy to do it's easy to catch an ISP playing that game
[13:50:42] <piou> The bigger the structure the harder this attack is to put in place in a stealthy way
[13:51:02] <dpirate> I certainly don't trust ISP/Google/Quad/Cloudflare/DNS-over-HTTP DNS servers. I resolve through tor and then if tor doesn't work dnscrypt-proxy.
[13:51:02] <piou> Which is why most DNS manipulations are part of things like company comprise

[19:08:51] <ajak> yeah, a stack overflow is completely different

[19:09:30] <ajak> coloquially these are more often referred to as "heap overflow" and "buffer overflow" respectively
[19:09:41] <ajak> (yes, the coloquial terms are less than precise)
[19:10:02] <Klinda> if a malloc suffer from a buffer overflow, is a heap overflow?

[19:11:01] <Klinda> if I read/write after it yes
[19:11:36] <Klinda> I mean if malloc has size 8
[19:11:37] <ajak> no, you're reading/writing to the memory buffer malloc returned, but those operations don't actually have anything to do with malloc itself
[19:12:04] <Klinda> and I read past to it
[19:12:06] <Klinda> is a buffer

[19:44:19] <Vitto> Nothing is perfect, so I wouldn't assume that
[19:45:17] <Vitto> Look at javascript and how many security holes were already found
[19:45:21] <LTCD> Vitto I meant in general, with something I could read.
[19:45:29] <elves-upstate> for double free and many memory-based issues, I think it's more a matter of using a garbage collector rather than being interpreted vs compiled.
[19:45:34] <LTCD> Vitto I should have specified, I was talking about C#.
[19:45:52] <LTCD> elves-upstate Well, since they come with a GC I guess they sort themselves out.
[19:46:38] <elves-upstate> for certain memory issues yeah, or at least they can make it easier or so that you mostly don't have to think about it
[19:47:21] <LTCD> elves-upstate So I am almost guaranteed not to find a double free vulnerability in C#...?

[19:49:17] <elves-upstate> i'm not confident enough to say that. never used C# either. but since you're not doing any freeing yourself i would assume as long as GC is correct double free shouldn't happen. unless you can call a destructor twice or something, again i've not used C#

[19:50:36] <LTCD> A problem I have is at university we are taught some basic code review stuff for C/C++ but in industry everyone is using Java, C# etc... which seems to be almost immune to vulnerabilities in native languages because the GC saves lives.

[19:51:39] <elves-upstate> there may be some memory vulnerabilities they are immune to compared to manual memory management languages but that's it AFAIK
[19:54:39] <elves-upstate> also for some they only prevent the serious error, but may still crash. e.g. I believe Java checks for array access out of bounds at runtime, but it'll throw an exception, which would crash the program if unhandled
[19:55:34] <LTCD> According to this, double free just impacts C and C++ https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/415.html
