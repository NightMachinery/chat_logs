[02:13:34] <kline> right?
[02:14:14] <kline> if work is going to throw a hackathon, it should be a no pressure environment, consequence free, in work time (unless they are paying you overtime), and no requirement to do your normal taskings

[02:17:07] <meff[m]> The places I've worked at it's been a week long event that happens during work hours. One year my hackathon project was just to okay around with Dhall. Another my "project" was to eat out
[02:17:39] <meff[m]> During that time expectations of tickets and such aren't there. Lots of folks just use it as a holiday which works too
[02:18:02] <manicennui> We have a hackathon every Halloween. People create Halloween themed displays that have nothing to do with work, and it is done during work hours.
[02:18:12] <manicennui> Then we have a party to display and vote on them, during work hours.

[12:46:16] <pja> imode: Apparently amd64 binaries use relative addressing (on Windows at least, not sure about ELF) which imposes a max 2Gb binary size limit.
[12:46:39] <pja> Or possible 4Gb if it’s +- 2GB ?
[12:47:12] <ignaloidas> can't you just set up a jump chain if it's relative addressing?
[12:47:23] <ignaloidas> extremely cursed of course, but should work
[12:47:26] <pja> Sure. If the compiler / linker supports it.
[12:47:48] <pja> Or you could probably use some horrible hacks to make it happen anyway.
[12:47:51] <meff[m]> heh yeah but that's a recipe for branch predictor misses
[12:48:31] <ignaloidas> why would be branch predictor misses?
[12:48:48] <ignaloidas> several jumps without conditionals in between would work just fine
[12:49:13] *** Quits: pr0t07ype (~pr0t07ype@user/pr0t07ype) (Quit: Client closed)
[12:49:36] <meff[m]> oh a static chain of jumps? yeah that'll work fine
[12:49:36] <ignaloidas> it would probably incur a code-prefetch penalty though
[12:49:41] <meff[m]> yeah
[12:50:54] <pja> Windows PE format encodes offsets from start of the binary as 32bit ints. So you’d have to dynamically load a bunch of dlls by hand into memory maybe to get something bigger/
[12:50:56] <pja> ?
[12:51:40] <meff[m]> even in 64 bit Windows?
[12:52:32] <pja> Yes, think so. See here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format
[12:52:33] <mockturtle> [ PE Format - Win32 apps ] - docs.microsoft.com

[15:46:10] <Ristovski> Did you guys know that (most? all?) Qualcomm SoCs support being powered solely off USB?
[15:47:10] <Ristovski> in sysfs, there's usually "charging_enabled" and "battery_charging_enabled", writing a 0 to the latter makes it not discharge the battery (well, I assume until you hit the max current of the port, then it will start using the battery)
[15:48:14] *** Joins: vernaz (~vernaz@148.63.127.167)
[15:48:58] <ignaloidas> any SoC can be powered by anything if you have enough voltage regulations
[15:49:44] <ignaloidas> the question is how healthy can you make the SoC with the voltage quality from a potato bimetal battery
[15:49:55] <Ristovski> indeed, but yet I don't think MTK can do this. At least none of the SoC models could that I have tried
[15:50:05] <c355e3b> you would need a lot of caps to get it to be stable and clean
[15:50:09] <c355e3b> but its doable
[15:50:50] <ignaloidas> c355e3b, no need for big caps if you're powereing from a potato battery, that thing should be pretty stable if it's not moving
[15:50:52] <Ristovski> oh lol, if I plug in a power bank and make it draw power from that only, I can hear the power fluctuations as coil whine coming from the power bank
[15:51:18] <c355e3b> Maybe? its been a bit since i've done anything at that level.

[21:57:14] <epilys> Teckla, not something you can explain in a few lines
[21:57:16] <companion_cube> P=NP would mean that potentially, factoring number is easy, which means RSA is broken
[21:57:23] <imode> tl;dr "this class of problems that you can solve in some time is equal to this class of problems that you can solve in some other time. the latter's time is much longer and involves crazy heuristics to solve, the former does not."

[21:58:19] <imode> so you can solve hard problems in a (relatively) short time, and we rely on the fact that they're difficult to do in a short time to do things like crypto.
[21:59:27] <Brekkjern> I thought the point of the N=NP problem was that we know "simple" or "quick" ways to verify that something is correct, but don't know of algorithms that are similarly simple to figure out the problem so you have to brute force them?
[21:59:55] <geoffwozniak> Brekkjern: that's basically correct, yeah.
[22:00:02] <meff[m]> well it's a pretty deep problem, if something is in NP then it scales very badly
[22:00:33] <meff[m]> most people think P != NP, but there's no proof that way
[22:00:34] <c355e3b> (in some cases it will scale badly)
[22:00:47] <meff[m]> yeah in some cases
[22:00:47] <Church> ^
[22:01:02] <c355e3b> I feel like we are going to see another complexity case or two fall out before p/np is over
[22:01:09] <imode> most of the literature involves trying to find an ordering to the problems within these classes.
[22:01:10] <meff[m]> yeah that's what I'm thinking too
[22:01:20] <imode> and then approach the boundary, so you can find some ordering there too.
[22:01:42] <c355e3b> and tbh, np isn't the scary class

I can probably figure that out, but what I have now requires me to run ". ./foo" (where "foo" is my program) for the cd (change directory) to take effect.
[22:24:20] <Teckla> I'm hoping someone can explain why that is.
[22:25:28] <Teckla> Maybe because I started foo.sh with "#/bin/sh"?  Maybe it's starting a new shell, changes the working directory for that shell process, and then that shell process exits?  Leaving me with the original shell in the original directory?

[23:00:43] <riv> currently: when you printf an enum its just a number
