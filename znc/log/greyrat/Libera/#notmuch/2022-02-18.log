[01:00:56] <rdbeni0> i don't have "tags=new;" in [new] section. It means default tags for new mails will be taken from maildir (unread, inbox). Correct?
[01:01:59] <anarcat> you can't do too much with notmuch!
[01:02:01] <anarcat> ;)
[01:03:58] <rdbeni0> it's true, but after the first few days of use, it looks like notmuch can replace thunderbird in my case
[01:04:09] <rdbeni0> i removed thunderbird : pacman -Rns thunderbird
[01:04:33] <rdbeni0> and now world looks different. Its little scary
[01:05:38] <anarcat> it's even scarier when you open Thunderbird again

[01:09:15] <rdbeni0> before my final decision "remove thunderbird forever", i checked their bugtracker. And it's dead software. For example they have some critical bugs which are not resolved since long time
[01:09:23] <rdbeni0> like 10 years
[01:10:00] <rdbeni0> it is sad that one of the main Linux email clients is in this bad condition
[01:10:34] <anarcat> i don't think thunderbird is dead
[01:10:41] <anarcat> but yes, it's not in a great state
[01:10:48] <anarcat> you'll find the same in firefox and chrome, btw

[15:34:34] <dagle> Or something like that.

[17:21:14] <rdbeni0> Hi all
[17:21:25] <rdbeni0> i would like to turn off tag:signed , can i do it via config file ?
[17:21:36] <rdbeni0> ot this tag is synchronized with maildir ?
[17:24:03] <inwit> bremner: That's true!! I totally forgot about it, sorry... I'll have a look.
[17:25:49] <bremner> rdbeni0: it is not configurable. It is also not synchronized with maildir (it uses internal MIME structure, which is not visible in the pathname
[17:25:52] <bremner> )
[17:26:37] <rdbeni0> so i will run: notmuch tag -signed -- tag:signed
[17:26:44] <rdbeni0> then it will not touch maildir structure ?
[17:27:33] <bremner> correct

[17:40:15] <rdbeni0> i would like to do something like that: create tag +trash , and in the sh script (post hook for example) mv all files with that +trash into ./maildir/[Gmail]/Bin/cur
[17:40:36] <rdbeni0> and as i understand, when i run mbsync -a , then emails will be moved into trash, yes?
[17:41:39] <rdbeni0> because maildir is directory based, so when email is moved between directories, then it will be reflected in remote imap server via command mbsync -a
[17:42:06] <rdbeni0> does it make sense?
[17:42:11] <bremner> well, probably? but it depends on what GMail does I guess
[17:45:46] <rdbeni0> you are right, they can do everything with email on their servers
[17:54:40] <rdbeni0> "attachment" is also not maildir tag/flag, yes? it's only notmuch internal

[17:57:23] <rdbeni0> https://notmuchmail.org/special-tags/
[17:59:06] <rdbeni0> ok, it's clear. Only 5 tags are synchronized with maildir

[19:46:50] <seanw> bremner: nmbug> aside from that parallelism issue which is real, I determined the main problem I was having was due to my wrapper code in ~/.mrconfig, which I have now fixed.
[19:47:43] <seanw> bremner: nmbug> I do notice that nmbug is fast on my laptop but slow on a machine on which notmuch itself is fine.  as my primary usage is syncing "killed thread" tags, I think I might be able to deal with it just by expiring old ones in a batch job on the repo.
[19:52:35] <bremner> seanw: basically my idea is to store the "lastmod" counter in the git repo, and use that to restrict the query when dumping
[19:54:48] <seanw> bremner: lastmod of what sorry?  I didn't have to dig too deep into nmbug's architecture.
[19:55:51] <bremner> of the database. as used in count --lastmod and lastmod:n..  queries
[19:56:57] <bremner> basically an operation counter in the database, but it allows dumping incrementally rather than whole database every time
[19:58:18] <seanw> bremner: wouldn't that be different on every host?  so rather than committing it to git you'd just want to store it in an uncommitted file?
[20:00:58] <bremner> oh, good point
[20:01:19] <seanw> but I mean I don't see why it couldn't be an uncommitted file
[20:01:26] <seanw> just a simple cache.
[20:01:27] <bremner> ack
[20:01:49] <bremner> anyway, depends where the bottleneck is if that would help
[20:02:25] <seanw> very unscientific, but when I was testing with verbosity turned up, it seemed like executing notmuch(1) once per tag was really slow.
[20:02:37] <seanw> as you'd expect it to be.  so it scales with the number of tags.
[20:02:49] <seanw> and your thing would help with that.
