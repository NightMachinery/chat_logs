[02:29:58] <regedit> is there a library/wrapper for different Email API Services? ex. sendgrid, mailgun, mailjet, sendinblue, etc etc?
[02:31:11] <__adrian> sendgrid, at least, has a php sdk
[02:31:37] <__adrian> but the others are generic enough i wouldn't want one. use phpmailer
[02:33:18] <regedit> should have clarified what i'm hoping for is a library/wrapper written to easily use/switch between any of multiple Email API services, unifying their similar API calls & actions - since they are all very similar
[02:33:32] <__adrian> > use phpmailer
[02:33:49] <regedit> phpmailer isnt for any particular email api service. sendgrid has a PHP library only for their own email API, mailjet has their own, sendinblue has their own etc
[02:34:15] <__adrian> regedit> phpmailer isnt for any particular email api service
[02:34:23] <__adrian> i'm back to not understanding your question, then
[02:34:41] <__adrian> you want a generic lib or a specific one?

[02:35:42] <regedit> 🤔
[02:35:48] <da_wunder> regedit: look at - https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html
[02:36:00] <da_wunder> that has support for multiple transports
[02:36:01] <__adrian> chooseProvider() // your exposing inner workings of things when there's no need to
[02:36:19] <__adrian> yeah, "multiple transports" is great
[02:36:33] <__adrian> but that doesn't mean you pick one or the other at runtime
[02:36:51] <da_wunder> yeah, that doesn't make sense
[02:36:57] <regedit> does it really not?
[02:37:01] <__adrian> no
[02:37:06] <regedit> this was looking kinda promising https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html#using-a-3rd-party-transport
[02:37:08] <__adrian> it's counterproductive
[02:37:26] <regedit> please do enlighten me
[02:38:05] <__adrian> you're bringing all those implementation details into your application code instead of leaving them wrapped up in the mail lib
[02:38:10] <__adrian> why would you want this?
[02:38:21] <regedit> let's say if i provide some platform-as-a-service, and i ask users to enter their sendgrid API key, or mailgun API key, or SendInBlue etc. and then my platform can send emails on their behalf using the email API service of their choice
[02:38:30] <__adrian> it's like using some incredible ORM and then manually building and passing sql to it
[02:38:43] <da_wunder> and in the runtime layer - do you really need to change mail transport to another one?
[02:39:03] <regedit> one user will use Mailgun, another user has an account with SendGrid...
[02:39:15] <__adrian> ^ this is more like configuration. "use trnasport X for user Y"
[02:39:27] <da_wunder> regedit: if you look at symfony example that is handled by using different configuration for mailer
[02:39:58] <regedit> ah ok, what's the main difference between how "runtime" works vs. how what you mean by "configuration"
[02:41:02] <regedit> for any given HTTP request coming to my PHP code, i'm not sure if it's gonna end up using Mailgun API or SendGrid API
[02:41:04] <da_wunder> runtime = each request / response that you make vs configuration just one setting that is used on each request / response

[02:41:14] <regedit> it depends on the user's accoount
[02:41:36] <regedit> can it work if it's a user setting saved in the database?
[02:42:19] <da_wunder> so really - you have _one_ application with N users, and you _really_ want to send user A emails with different transport than user B ?
[02:42:32] <da_wunder> for me that doesn't make sense at all
[02:43:16] <regedit> looking at the above Symfony URL, i can definitely see some users preferring to use their Gmail SMTP, other users wanting to use their Email API service
[02:43:49] <da_wunder> that is _your_ application that is sending those emails - not the users
[02:43:59] <regedit> is it not possible to have such dynamic offerings? PHP web applications must remain married to 1 and only 1 email service? 🤔
[02:44:33] <da_wunder> sure it's possible, but as I said earlier that doesn't make sense at all
[02:45:40] <da_wunder> you need multiple email provider accounts, and to make sure that those emails aren't spam - you most likely need to use dedicated ip for those and that cost money and so on...
[02:46:15] <da_wunder> what is the "real" reason why you would need to use different email providers in _same_ application for user A and B?
[02:46:42] <Sammitch> sure it's possible, you just have to write it.
[02:49:11] <regedit> (sorry phone) right i guess what i meant is; is it not a useful concept implemented in an existing library/wrapper to handle multiple Email API services
[02:50:09] <regedit> as for the "real" reason - trying to think about it... as of right now it seems like i have user 1 and user 2, user 1 wants to send email via their SMTP, user 2 wants to use a modern emailing API service...
[02:51:10] <da_wunder> imho - you should not do that at all - it makes your application way too much complex
[02:51:48] <da_wunder> if that is really needed - create new instance of that application for user 1 and 2 and configure that email provider for both of those instances as needed
[02:52:52] <Sammitch> here's my take: 1. that's an incredibly esoteric and, frankly, inadvisable use case. 2. why let your clients dictate what email service YOUR service sends mail through? YOU pick a provider, and charge the client a premium for sending their mail. 3. why would I, as a client, hand over credentials to my 3rd-party mail service to a questionably trustworthy middleman?
[02:53:19] <da_wunder> ^
[02:53:49] <Sammitch> otherwise you're just going to be spending you days writing middleware for every email service every time they update their API
[02:53:58] <Sammitch> for free
[02:54:34] <regedit> unless there's already a library/wrapper which sort of does that anyway?...
[02:54:43] <da_wunder> and really, does those users really care which email provider is sending those emails?
[02:55:05] <regedit> point #2 is interesting Sammitch 🤔
[02:55:26] <regedit> point #3 is also a good point 😆
[02:55:36] <da_wunder> regedit: you should realize with messages here, any of those libraries doesn't support that by default for those reasons
[02:56:12] <da_wunder> but sure _you_ could do that with your own custom implementation - but really I don't recommend you to do that
[02:56:12] <Sammitch> I woudl rephrase that as "none of those libraries bothered implementing anything like this for reasons such as these"
[02:56:14] <regedit> how does this Symfony library work then? how does it only allow 1 at a time and _not_ another ?
[02:56:51] <regedit> API credentials are obtained from hardocded configuration?
[02:56:54] <da_wunder> regedit: symfony library just uses configuration - and that configuration is telling which transport to use
[02:57:02] <regedit> i see...
[02:57:07] <Sammitch> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_one_infinity_rule
[02:57:13] <Sammitch> they picked "one"
[02:57:13] <da_wunder> regedit: and really you could use multiple transports with that easily if you want
[02:57:23] <regedit> couldnt i?
[02:58:18] <regedit> what's so "wrong" about trying to do that heh...
[02:58:24] <da_wunder> for each email request just create new mailer instance with specified configuration - but really I don't recommend you to do that
[02:59:06] <Sammitch> it's not "wrong", it's "I don't see why we would expend that effort"
[02:59:36] <Sammitch> and "if I'm going to expend that much effort I'm going to keep it in house and charge people money to use it"
[02:59:45] <regedit> i'm just moving the question from coding time to user time; instead of "hey programmer, choose from all of these provider choices" to "hey end user - you choose" 🤔
[03:00:24] <da_wunder> one big thing is security - how do those different users configure their email credentials - and can you be sure that those are entered correctly? - you need to store those to eg. database - so you might have a bug on your application to expose those and so on
[03:00:33] <regedit> wait a minute Sammitch i thought the whole notion was "wrong and bad" is it ok if it's made in house and charges money tho? then it should be allowable to inquire for such a feature 😆
[03:01:02] <regedit> da_wunder true, fair point
[03:02:17] <regedit> as it is this web application is already dealing with much "worse" sensitive info... we're already needing to be HIPAA compliant, we have SSNs, and more horrible things... (thank goodness no credit cards heh) so i guess we'll add these account credentials to the layers of encrypted security we have in place for other sensitive stuff i guess
[03:02:28] <da_wunder> and really if you use some external services for email sending - those will cost some money - so why would you want to pay for all of those? even if no one is not using those - or if just one user wants to use service Y and you need to pay some money monthly about that
[03:03:03] <da_wunder> so please - don't make your application more comples - keep things simple
[03:04:35] <da_wunder> s/comples/complex
[03:06:28] <regedit> on the contrary; i'm passing off the headache & cost of the email service to the user, so we don't have to deal with that choice & cost
[03:06:41] <regedit> we just have to offer them the options
[03:08:35] <da_wunder> regedit: never thinked to just use one provider - include that to normal price - and then track amount of those emails that users sends - say that you allow eg. 1000 free emails per month and after that X more money
[03:09:54] <da_wunder> regedit: and what you said - that will need that your customers are making those contracts with email providers - so you don't have any access to those - so possible error debugging will be just nightmare

[03:12:44] <regedit> it this way or that way, sometimes it's better to do it this way sometimes better to do it that way etc. at least there's the choice/option/possibility
[03:12:47] <da_wunder> regedit: also if you're paying eg. 50$ per month for email sending (like 50k emails) and if your customers pay eg. 10$ month for that - you should get some profit quite soon - and it's just easier for your customers - they doesn't need to create some accounts to 3rd party email providers and so on

[03:18:14] <regedit> but i wasnt there with you in ~2003 so i'm probably missing a lot of the picture
[03:18:38] <da_wunder> regedit: you would be surprised how bad those api's are for information like that
[03:19:28] <da_wunder> eg. for billing  errors you could just get "bad credentials" error - because if that is telling something else it is potentially leaking information about your customers
[03:19:52] <regedit> i thought i remember seeing each of those API docs having an elaborate page of error codes & messages... but yeah it is kinda nightmarish to need to look into each/all of those... that's what i would hope a library/wrapper would black-box for me so i dont need to worry about
[03:20:40] <da_wunder> but please do what ever you want - using user based email providers is possible with that symfony library - you just need some custom code top of that - but I really recommend you to not to do that
[03:20:55] <regedit> and yes sometimes there are "cross-system" incompatibilities such as "with SendGrid does not support this error - instead it returns a generic error 500" etc...

[17:24:35] <alien_lappy> anyone know how to do this better?
[17:25:44] <Naktibalda> alien_lappy: are you looking for method_exists()
[17:26:07] <Naktibalda> !+method_exists
[17:26:07] <php-bot> bool method_exists(object object, string method)  - Checks if the class method exists - http://php.net/method_exists
[17:26:11] <alien_lappy> that does seem like what i need here
[17:26:18] <alien_lappy> but why does isset not work?
[17:26:31] <alien_lappy> i never had this issue in the past? is it bad to check with isset() ?
[17:26:37] <Naktibalda> because properties and methods are separate.
[17:27:15] <alien_lappy> but isset worked on class functions before?
[17:27:25] <Naktibalda> no, never
[17:27:38] <alien_lappy> hmm, really?

[17:39:00] <biberu> alien_lappy: i guess that's just an example, but maybe A shouldn't be allowed to terminate the entire program

[19:52:00] <Naktibalda> how about using apache with mod_php instead?
[19:52:14] <da_wunder> that version is not supported anymore, so I really recommend you to update your php at somepoint
[19:52:48] <axisys> apache 2.4.46 with mpm_event is needed for mod_http2 which does not allow mod_php

[19:53:15] <Naktibalda> check requirements of the project you are using, there is a big jump from PHP 5.4, so your code may be incompatible with one or the other
[19:53:19] *** Joins: genom (~g@37.214.44.252)
[19:53:21] <axisys> you have to change it to mpm_prefork to use mod_php .. so that will break the other requirement

[19:54:29] <axisys> yeah we are testing in dev environment..
[19:55:22] <Naktibalda> da_wunder: it is supported by Redhat
[19:57:38] <Naktibalda> my previous job started upgrade to Centos 7 at the beginning of this year (downgrade from 5.6.44 to 5.4.16 with an option to upgrade to PHP 7.2 if things are too bad on PHP 5.4)
[19:58:26] <da_wunder> tools like rector could help you within your codebase for those changes

[21:19:06] <Naktibalda> your code needs it
[21:19:31] <Naktibalda> if your project uses mysql, install php74-mysql it will install PDO too
[21:19:57] <da_wunder> and with earlier php version you most likely had that installed, but now you upgraded your php version it might not install all the necessary extensions that your application needs

[21:36:22] <axisys> I would say lot of stuff would be failing if it were not running
[21:36:40] <__adrian> phpinfo() always produces output. if you don't see output, the function was not invoked.
[21:37:11] <__adrian> e.g., maybe there's an error on the page? maybe you got the wrong url?

[21:38:35] <php-bot> The closing php tag `?>` is not for ending scripts; rather, it's for _beginning_ literal output.   it's like `echo "anything and everything until the next <?php tag";`  probably not what you meant.
[21:38:39] <axisys> da_wunder did not have the > , I just added it
[21:39:27] <axisys> so it could be ?> .. so mine has it wrong here
[21:39:32] <__adrian> axisys: do you mean ">" or "?>"
[21:39:40] <__adrian> ">" is NOT a php tag
[21:39:55] <axisys> <?php phpinfo();>
[21:40:00] <axisys> this is what I have

[21:40:48] <php-bot> In addition to configuring error reporting (/msg php-bot error reporting), set log_errors=1 and error_log=/path/to/your/error.log in your php.ini file. This allows you to simply tail the log to see errors, and to disable display_errors (e.g., during production).
[21:41:06] <axisys> yep .. that was it.. syntax error on my part
[21:41:45] <axisys> __adrian: thanks for the error
[21:44:17] <axisys> da_wunder: phpinfo() has lots of stuff.. which one shows the php packages I need?
[21:44:39] <__adrian> more specifically, phpinfo will show you what you _have_
[21:44:50] <__adrian> which should be a good starting point for you to figure out what you _need_
[21:45:01] <da_wunder> and that might be different versus what your application _needs_
[21:45:02] <__adrian> look at the extensions it shows enabled
[21:45:27] <da_wunder> ^
[21:48:44] <axisys> honestly I am not sure what is called extension. I do see PDO as a separate box .. I suppose all extensions are these independent boxes
[21:51:06] <axisys> I am comparing the two versions and already seeing stuff missing
[21:55:15] <__adrian> "different" doesn't necessarily mean "missing"
[21:55:17] <da_wunder> we cannot know if your application needs those missing stuff - you should know that - and really now you should document all those necessary extensions and other stuff to your application documentation

[21:55:53] <chazy> hi, is it ok to ask about deployment and hardware configuration for php apps?
[21:56:15] <axisys> so far no luck finding rpm for php74-pdo_pgsql
[21:56:37] <__adrian> chazy: maybe i broad terms, but probably not really on topic. ask, if there's a better place to ask we'll see
[21:56:40] <__adrian> *in
[21:56:45] <axisys> __adrian: right we switched to postgres a while ago, so I don't need the pdo mysql driver for example
[21:56:47] <da_wunder> axisys: it might be named differently
[21:59:56] <da_wunder> axisys: command like `yum list php74-pdo\*` might give you the proper package - it has been a while when I last used rh
[22:01:58] <chazy> __adrian: ok, i have a team writing a web (game) app, i'm not sure if i should go with faster cores (ryzen 5950x) or double slower cores (epyc 7502P), they'll optimize the code and queries such as limiting rows returning, etc, but this is the first app i'll be deploying for production and i just don't know where i should deploy it, we expect to have many online users at the same time, around 10-30k
[22:02:00] <chazy> users and even 100k in the near future (but we'll probably need more instances by then), although i know code is more important and we're looking to cache as much as possible (ram won't be a problem)
[22:02:24] <__adrian> php generally does better with speed
[22:02:33] <__adrian> it's single-threaded
[22:03:03] <__adrian> might you need many cores (horizontal scaling) also? sure maybe

[22:04:06] <Naktibalda> single threaded but serves many requests using different processes concurrently.
[22:04:35] <__adrian> ^
[22:04:40] <chazy> so even though zen 3 (desktop) is about 40% faster than zen 2 (server)?
[22:04:48] <__adrian> 7502P is likely plenty fast too btw
[22:04:49] <chazy> single threaded
[22:05:00] <__adrian> yes
[22:05:24] <__adrian> desktop processors aren't meant for server use. you can do it in a home lab but not IRL
[22:05:26] <chazy> probably, it's just i searched for some reviews and it's about 40% slower in ST
[22:05:29] <da_wunder> chazy: or just use some cloud service, where you can quite easily to scale that server hardware if/when it's needed
[22:05:38] <__adrian> that too ^
[22:05:58] <__adrian> scalability is a good thing to make easy
[22:06:07] <chazy> no, i won't be hosting this myself at home, i'm looking for a hosting with good prices
[22:06:15] <da_wunder> even scale up and down automatically depending the traffic
[22:06:33] <__adrian> if that epyc proves too slow (note, _proves_) there a "F" SKUs also
[22:06:58] <da_wunder> chazy: then I would recommend you to use some cloud service like aws, gcp, etc. for that infra
[22:07:03] <chazy> this is the one hosting i'm looking atm https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ax161

[22:10:42] <__adrian> then... maybe
[22:11:03] <chazy> if it goes well i won't need to migrate it
[22:11:04] <__adrian> but on-demand scaling will probably be better long run (esp. for php) than dedicated servers
[22:11:48] <da_wunder> personally I would start small, and see if there is need for more speed and then scale that up - and with aws, gcp that scaling up is quite "simple" thing - with dedicated servers that won't be so easy
[22:12:32] <chazy> hmm then i need to look for another hosting
[22:12:41] <chazy> or if that one offers on-demand scaling
[22:15:08] <chazy> so, i'm looking for a cloud vps that can scale?
[22:16:11] <da_wunder> eg. aws and gcp
