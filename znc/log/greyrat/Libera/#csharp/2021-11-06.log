[01:36:21] <Nasp> I have a feeling it's too much
[01:36:35] <moose> I doubt most C# developers have actually written an extension method.
[01:36:39] <lz__> btw I just realized I'm almost as dumb because I always write string.IsNullOrEmpty(str)
[01:36:40] <moose> And by that I mean senior paid engineers.
[01:36:57] <moose> I think maybe 2 of the 10 C# specialist devs on my team have ever written one in their career.

[01:38:40] <Nasp> I've written a lot, especially for DateTime
[01:38:41] <moose> Every job I've worked, most C# developers have very little desire to improve things for readability or structure.

[01:38:47] <moose> I write them, but I also give a shit.

[01:39:07] <Nasp> It's a shame
[01:39:10] <moose> It is.
[01:39:15] <lz__> I don't think it's an improvement, you don't know what comes from what assembly. I wrote one once, it's still annoying me

[01:42:59] <lz__> wait yes I'm actually using a few extensions, but I still hate having to know what using to add
[01:43:19] <lz__> maybe intellisense should list them even when they're not referenced yet
