[21:25:41] <imode> the corrections are meaningless.
[21:25:46] <imode> that person is an asshole.
[21:26:00] <riv> ahh thats such a good way to look at it
[21:26:20] <dminkovsky> it's true though. the last thing in the world that makes sense to optimize are your fucking docker layers
[21:26:48] <jlindgren> big agree. if you're already using docker why would you even be worried about disk space
[21:26:56] <jlindgren> shipping the entire truck to deliver a letter lol
[21:27:25] <jlindgren> i swear `&& \` has never been used more than in dockerfiles too
[21:27:35] <jlindgren> one big layer > 3 smaller layers? is it that different?
[21:27:43] <dminkovsky> i mean it's cute that my nginx container is 20MB while my app containers are 600MB but the fact that those containers are 600 MB has (and never will) be a problem
[21:27:44] <jlindgren> (esp if its just for development)
[21:27:53] <imode> I use && tbf but it's not something I'm getting into a tizzy over.
[21:28:09] <jlindgren> yep, its all the same
[21:28:33] <dminkovsky> yeah i tend to write them out without `&&` while developing because it's easier to work out what i want and then collapse to && but it's total horse shit to point out
[21:28:37] <jlindgren> i think its just being pedantic to say use less layers when it accomplishes the same thing.
[21:28:53] <riv> im surprised that you all are already using docker
[21:28:58] <imode> "can cause problems" like what.
[21:29:03] <imode> running out of space?

[21:30:39] <dminkovsky> lol yeah unless you're a graybeard it's useful as f
[21:30:40] <imode> it is. to a point.
[21:30:51] <dminkovsky> i am but a fullstack developer
[21:31:04] <dminkovsky> imode: what would you say that point is
[21:31:48] <imode> it's a tool that's bloated and tied to a dying company, presenting a kernel feature under the guise of a unique product.
[21:31:59] <imode> and overused in some situations.
[21:32:13] <riv> oh right its basically just a frontend to lxc
[21:32:19] <imode> it has some nontrivial security problems.
[21:32:24] <riv> but I was using lxc and lxd in the past, and they were so difficult to use
[21:32:27] <imode> all of this and the world keeps turning anyway.
[21:32:33] <jlindgren> (puts on red hat) well at least we have podman for the inevitable day docker kicks the bucket
[21:32:37] <riv> :D
[21:32:38] <imode> ayyyyy.
[21:33:11] <jlindgren> i wish lxc had more adoption.
[21:33:21] <jlindgren> being able to spin up a full vm basically as fast as a container is mind blowingly good
[21:35:40] <dminkovsky> yeah i was chatting about this the other month with manicennui
[21:35:46] <riv> yeah i love how fast lxc is compared to vbox
[21:35:47] <dminkovsky> apparently docker might not be dying
[21:36:04] <riv> I was using it for steam for a while
[21:36:09] <dminkovsky> the security issues are the problem really, in my mind, and i'm no security person
[21:36:18] <dminkovsky> i'll adopt one of the open standards/podman when i can
[21:36:23] <riv> but eventually steam broke and i couldn't figure out if it was because of my container or not (it actually wasn't the container)
[21:36:24] <dminkovsky> it's just containers are freaking nice

[21:39:59] <riv> didnt want steam to rm -rf ~

[22:21:12] <jlindgren> "yeah i pay for my profile pictures, that makes me better than other people for some reason"
[22:21:13] <dminkovsky> "we need to figure out this right-click problem"
[22:21:16] <companion_cube> not sure if trollingâ€¦
[22:21:30] <dminkovsky> god
[22:22:21] <riv> people have got in trouble for URL editing before
[22:22:22] <jlindgren> my favorite response is this thread: https://twitter.com/eevee/status/1459518157857591296?s=20
[22:22:22] <buttsbot> Twitter - eevee - damn!  they got us good folks.  this is 100% foolproof, backed by the blockchain https://t.co/9mCN921owL
[22:23:25] <imode> oh my god is twitter really doing the NFT thing...
[22:23:34] <jlindgren> apparently
[22:23:39] <imode> FUCK
[22:24:13] <imode> I'm retreating into the proverbial woods now.
[22:24:20] <imode> discord is doing the NFT thing too. -_-
[22:25:01] <companion_cube> I hope freenode is, as well
[22:25:03] <companion_cube> I mean irc.com
[22:25:04] <jlindgren> lol
[22:25:20] <jlindgren> irc, but on the blockchain. no need for logs. the blockchain IS the logs
[22:26:02] <dminkovsky> fuck logs!
[22:26:15] <dminkovsky> the whole premise that everything needs to be logged is so fucked up
[22:26:16] <companion_cube> honestly I'd buy a NFT of the comics irc log
[22:26:21] <companion_cube> some parts of it were epic
[22:26:52] <imode> dminkovsky: I like logs because they are artifacts of conversations. I refer to those artifacts.
[22:27:23] <dminkovsky> i like that too
[22:27:31] <dminkovsky> but i like things going away more
[22:27:33] <dminkovsky> personally
[22:28:16] <dminkovsky> anyway i wasn't talking about IRC logs so much as the whole pervasive notion that just cause you can it means that you should
[22:28:19] <dminkovsky> with regards to digital things
[22:28:57] <dminkovsky> i dunno man, the world
[22:31:06] <dminkovsky> A bureaucrat armed with a computer is the unacknowledged legislator of our age, and a terrible burden to bear.
[22:36:49] <dminkovsky> our blockchain future is going to be an eternal cryptobureaucratic hellscape

[23:13:55] *** Joins: cot (~kiedtl@kisslinux/kiedtl)
[23:14:08] <cot> Anyone know why arp242 left lobste.rs?
[23:15:02] <imode> what makes you think they left?
[23:15:24] <imode> _oh_
[23:15:37] <imode> uh.
[23:15:44] * imode shrugs.
[23:17:25] <cot> I'm inclined to believe vermillion now when they say we're "hemorraghing our best users"
[23:17:31] <cot> hope it's a mistake
[23:18:09] <imode> ask it in #lobsters.
[23:18:47] <riv> they have deleted twitter and reddit too
[23:18:49] <cot> Interesting, they deleted their twitter as well
[23:18:52] <riv> probably trying to get some actual work done
[23:18:56] <cot> Probably yeah
[23:18:57] <imode> woah.
[23:19:14] <imode> you don't just nuke your social media presence to get work done.
[23:19:19] <imode> hope they're alright..
[23:19:20] <cot> sabbatical?
[23:19:40] <imode> you just don't look at it. you don't nuke it.
[23:19:44] <imode> that's not a reversible action.
[23:19:57] <cot> nuking a lobste.rs account is, though
[23:20:06] <imode> is it?
[23:20:10] <cot> I really should nuke mine, I'll be less tempted to engage there
[23:20:21] <cot> yeah, it can be recovered from the 'forgot password' screen
[23:20:34] <imode> huh.
[23:21:07] <imode> why reddit and twitter, then.
[23:21:21] <imode> that's not reversible.
[23:22:19] *** eldritch_ is now known as eldritch
[23:22:36] <cot> well, nothing of value lost there :P
[23:22:49] <cot> folks delete reddit account all the time
[23:23:17] <Church> Eh some leave, some come back
[23:23:26] <Church> Had geocar posting a bit again after a few years
[23:30:56] <imode> Church: are you related to Church-.
[23:40:02] <Church> Yes
[23:40:04] <Church> That's me
[23:41:13] <imode> oh. wow.
[23:41:33] <Church> I mean I would think it'd be obvious. :p
[23:41:43] <imode> yeah but I didn't know. :P
[23:42:27] <Church> Heh fair
