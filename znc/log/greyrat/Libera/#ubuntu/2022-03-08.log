[00:06:50] <rfm> boblamont, the files need to have group www-data, doesn't really matter what the user is.  What I did was put the user used for uploading in www-data group, then chgrp all the files to www-data, and make all the directories group www-data, and make the directories setgid  (chmod g+s /directory/path).  Then all uploaded files get group www-data.

[01:32:09] <plujon> sarnold: my desktop still froze
[01:32:18] <bobdobbs> Hi all. I'm trying to install ubuntu virtually using virtualbox. I'm following this tutorial: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox . I've created a virtual machine and configured it to take a linux install. However, when I start the virtual machine, I get a message telling me that there is nothing bootable. I'm expecting to be prompted for the location of installable media, but the
[01:32:18] <bobdobbs> prompt doesn't happen.
[01:32:26] <plujon> The problem seems to be triggered by scrolling down in Vivaldi.
[01:32:41] <bobdobbs> The prompt I'm expecting is described at the first step here: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#3-install-your-image
[01:33:45] <bobdobbs> I have installed OS's using virtualbox before. But I can't remember the trick to begin the actual OS installation after setting up the VM.
[01:33:57] <tomreyn> webchat62: yes, you actually have the latest installed. 5.13.0.30.33~20.04.17 - and that's apparently what's running, too. so it has to be something else. maybe a hardware or firmware issue. you could look into how to reset the nvram on this computer.

[01:43:55] <tomreyn> bobdobbs: if you're running virtualbox on ubuntu, to boot a guest system, you'd "insert" (load, from file) the installers' ISO file into the (virtual) cd-rom drive and set the right boot mode (defaults to bios, uefi is available).
[01:44:05] <bobdobbs> tomreyn: not so much with configuring it. Just figuring out how to get it to install an os
[01:44:22] <plujon> I can reproduce the problem at will.  It seems like gnome-session should be resilient in the face of a misbehaving app, but I don't know much about how windowing on Linux works.
[01:44:55] <plujon> I kinda suspect Vivaldi goes into an infinite loop while holding some resource that gnome-session also uses.
[01:45:57] <tomreyn> bobdobbs: there is documentation by virtualbox, which is not bad, and there is a self-support channel on the irc.oftc.net IRC network. in #vbox
[01:46:02] <bobdobbs> tomreyn: I've got an iso sitting on my hard drive. When the VM I've configured is running, I can't see a way to load it.

I have tried 20.0.4 and 20.0.3 lts. 3 different flashd rives, one is brand new out of the box, and now also 3 different target nvme disk, one i just bought today, but all new. I keep getting an error that the source file does not match the target
[07:25:25] <RootDet> This seems to be rather or not i select the network option, or anything. I am at my witts end what to do, becausde there is anything else to replace here except motherboard.

[07:25:56] <RootDet> I've done that too, i tried rufus and blanche for the usb install

[10:43:13] <NeoFAT32> Probably but I'm running a second screen on the motherboard GPU so it's an Intel HD Graphics.
[10:43:23] <NeoFAT32> Do you have a solution to improve its performances ?
[10:43:46] <NeoFAT32> Because if what they said was right, it's running it through the kernel.
[10:44:13] <Heston> intel has open source linux drivers so it should be decent
[10:44:18] <NeoFAT32> So when I move a windows on this screen, it's working like I just installed windows without updating drivers.
[10:44:28] <NeoFAT32> What's that driver ?

[10:47:55] <NeoFAT32> I find it clearly stupid to improve Nvidia drivers while most of computers are running Intel CPU/GPU. Quit strange that they improved Nvidia drivers before Intel ones, at least, it's using the kernel.

[20:40:00] <clarkk> I'm running Ubuntu 20.04 with Gnome 3.36.8.  All of a sudden, today, gnome-shell has started using 100% CPU. When this happens, it takes 1 minute to do every single action, which means shutting down all my apps and rebooting takes about half an hour. I've had to do this three times today
[20:40:25] <clarkk> Can anyone suggest what could suddenly cause this (I haven't made any changes), if there's anything that is most likely to be the cause, and how I can troubleshoot it?  Have people been reporting similar issues a lot recently?

[23:44:45] <Intelo> What is the most light  weigh git hosting platform ? gitlab is very resource hungry?
[23:44:45] <Intelo> Is there a way to ping an external server on github actions (push, pull_request). That external server a) git checkout the branch, b) run linting, c) reply success or failure to github action so d) it can show a green/red tick? I could have done this by adding ssh key but I don't want it
[23:44:46] <Intelo> [22:14:16] <Intelo> Thanks
