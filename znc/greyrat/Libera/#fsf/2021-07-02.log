[06:11:59] <Techman> I am assuming that GitHub has ran their little idea past legal, probably quite a few times
[06:12:25] <Techman> Obviously using GPL code to train their AI that can be used in proprietary environments is not great
[06:12:45] <Techman> They might see a loophole in copyright law as it stands
[06:13:01] <Gnuman> The fact that it accidentally reproduced the entire GPL license as a code suggestion means it's very likely to reproduce large portions of GPL code
[06:13:32] <Techman> That comment in that /r/programming thread that brought up the concept of an entire work vs just a snippet is very good
[06:14:03] <Techman> May be hard to tell if a function, especially a "basic" one, came from a GPL project or not
[06:14:15] <Gnuman> yeah, this is going to be a tough one. Where do you draw the line? What if "I added some basic compression/decompression to my closed-source program" just pulls in all of gzip?

[07:08:54] <bugweiser> well, mit is popular. But fixing the 'vessel' (specifically the warranty disclaimer) that transports how you carve up your rights would still change the mit. I'ts beyond me why one would would knowingly commit a crime finable to up to 220000 dollar in this continent called australia..
[07:10:14] <bugweiser> using gpl, for no other reason than that it correctly disclaims the disclaimer (so to say) by utilising the prase: TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW

[07:11:33] <bugweiser> that's kinda a bit much. Hence the logical question, is there a short sussinct licence in that mit/isc/0bsd style that got that line covered, and one can just safely slap that on?

[07:16:57] <bugweiser> thanks for the suggestion, that one (and cc0 and friends) have been examined, and as far as we can tell, not all jurisdictions support the notion of 'public domain' at which point silly disclaimers one again rear their ugly head (just as liability disclaimers exist for the cases where the warranty disclaimer can't be exercised). 
[07:18:58] <bugweiser> so the main question at hand is basically still: mid/0bsd/isc style licence with with a more modern international warranty disclaimer instead of the old historic usa-centered disclaimers.

[20:04:10] <tpefreedom> (Aside from any nonfree JS that is.)
[20:04:19] <kompowiec> I use the Polish version of craiglist, OLX, from time to time. The best method in my opinion is money in advance for shipping.
[20:04:32] <kompowiec> no escrow required.
[20:04:55] <tpefreedom> escrow?
[20:05:10] <kompowiec> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrow
[20:05:24] <kompowiec> escrow is a third party payment method.
[20:05:35] <kompowiec> eg. when you buy on amazon or aliexpress, you use escrow
[20:05:49] <kompowiec> because amazon and aliexpress are the party to the transaction.
[20:05:55] <tpefreedom> It seems like cragslist is largely local pickup.

[20:26:48] <tpefreedom> Or do we have it boot to a home screen?
[20:27:07] <kompowiec> IMO best way it's buying rpi or libre tea computer and e-ink monitor, which is expensive..

[22:56:28] <bugweiser> bone-baboon, thanks!!
[22:56:51] <bugweiser> so, the MS-PL is licensed under MS-PL ?
[22:57:10] <donald> bugweiser: i think the shared source thing just gives access to source for certain purposes, so likely just a proprietary license there
[22:57:31] *** Quits: craigt (~Icedove@jumpgate.fsf.org) (Quit: craigt)

[23:00:29] <donald> are you wanting to make your own license using it? don't do that lol, there's plenty of good fre licenses to choose from on that list
[23:01:31] <bugweiser> I joined a team that roled their own licence. I can understand, but the utterly and completely messed up all contractual related parts. the only thing 'usable' is how they carve up the rights.

[23:02:11] <bugweiser> I can understand, becouse everyone fails to point people to a MIT/ICS/0BSD style licence that doesnt' suffer from the big long known probem
[23:02:40] <bugweiser> ie, being archaic and utterly usa -only centered (not talking aboout how one carves up their rights).
[23:03:18] *** Quits: alexxey (~Alexey@user/alexxey) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[23:03:20] <bugweiser> and, understandably, they want it to be small, to be able to include it in full in source. I get that.
[23:03:35] *** Joins: tenshi (~red@user/tenshi)
[23:03:56] <bugweiser> so, currently they have a failed vanity licence.
[23:05:01] <bugweiser> I want to fix that, before it really is to late, but only 'improving' it to the point where it is equivalent to mit/ics/0bsd is useless, it would still be a vanity licence and add to licence proliferation.
[23:06:09] <donald> my only recommendation would be to just use a license that already exists and has been reviewed by lawyers
[23:06:12] <bugweiser> whilst the only thing they (and so much others  I spoke to over the years) want is a friggin modernized (for international use, due to this thing called internet) MIT/ICS/0BSD style thing, and obviously as small and dense as humanly possible.

[23:09:39] <bugweiser> gplv2 doesnt' fail, got that part correct. but it's huge and fsf stated it will never ever be viewes as a 'bare-licence' (ie not a contract).
[23:09:46] <tpefreedom> What is the correct warrenty waiver?
[23:09:58] *** Quits: madcap2 (~m4dc4p_2@110.44.62.94.rev.vodafone.pt) (Client Quit)
[23:10:34] <bugweiser> it must disclaim the disclaimer, so to say,otherwise you commit a crime punishable up to 220000 dollar in this continent called australia
[23:11:12] *** Joins: madcap (~m4dc4p_2@110.44.62.94.rev.vodafone.pt)
[23:11:31] <bugweiser> we know of an EXCELENT waiver, I have seen no other waiver this short.. But it's used by the biggest software corporation on the face of the earth (for over 20 years):

[23:12:06] <tpefreedom> and EVERYTHING needs a warrenty waiver in Australia?
[23:12:11] <donald> this is pretty off topic for the directory meeting
[23:12:21] <bugweiser> https://dpaste.com/99BU6SAZU
[23:12:24] <donald> maybe, we can pick it up again in 20 minutes when the meeting is over?
[23:12:44] <bugweiser> deal, I'll gladly hold!
[23:12:48] <donald> thanks

[23:13:56] <donald> bone-baboon: that's also kind of off topic for the directory but you can message webmasters@gnu.org and they'll likely know what to do
[23:13:57] <bugweiser> dpefreedom: yes, that's the main purpose of a 'public licence' (you also offer it in australia, at least, your webserver/github does that for you). But let's hold this subject untill their meeting is over.
[23:14:59] <bone-baboon> donald: Okay
[23:15:04] <donald> we moved the services explanation to the category page https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Category:Services
[23:15:31] <donald> and added a bit on the requirements page to let people know when to tag an entry with it
[23:15:59] <tpefreedom> donald: Are you going to add more entries?
[23:16:01] <donald> right now there's just the one package, but there's likely others that would fit there as well
[23:16:15] <donald> tpefreedom: yup, over time as we come across stuff
[23:16:41] <donald> though maybe we'll start up a project team if someone has interest in finding entries that should get the services notice

[23:24:12] <tpefreedom> "How Service as a Software Substitute Takes Away Your Freedom  Service as a Software Substitute (SaaSS) means using a service as a substitute for running your copy of a program.  Concretely, it means that someone sets up a network server that does certain computing activities—for instance, modifying a photo, translating text into another language, etc.—then invites users to let that server do their own computing for them.  As a us
[23:24:12] <tpefreedom> the server, you would send your data to the server, which does that computing activity on the data thus provided, then sends the results back to you or else acts directly on your behalf.  What does it mean to say that a given computing activity is your own?  It means that no one else is inherently involved in it.  To clarify the meaning of “inherently involved”, we present a thought experiment.  Suppose that any free software you 
[23:24:12] <tpefreedom> need for the job is available to you, and whatever data you might need, as well as computers of whatever speed, functionality and capacity might be required.  Could you do this particular computing activity entirely within those computers, not communicating with anyone else's computers?  If you could, then the activity is entirely your own.  For your freedom's sake, you deserve to control it.  If you do it by running free software, yo
[23:24:12] <tpefreedom> ontrol it.  However, doing it via someone else's service would give that someone else control over your computing activity.  We call that scenario SaaSS, and we say it is unjust.  By contrast, if for fundamental reasons you couldn't possibly do that activity in your own computers, then the activity isn't entirely your own, so the issue of SaaSS is not applicable to that activity. In general, these activities involve communication with
[23:24:12] <tpefreedom> s....Another clear example is using a service such as Flickr or Instagram to modify a photo.  Modifying photos is an activity that people have done in their own computers for decades; doing it in a server you don't control, rather than your own computer, is SaaSS.  Rejecting SaaSS does not mean refusing to use any network servers run by anyone other than you.  Most servers are not SaaSS because the jobs they do are some sort of commun
[23:24:12] <tpefreedom> n, rather than the user's own computing.  The original idea of web servers wasn't to do computing for you, it was to publish information for you to access.  Even today this is what most web sites do, and it doesn't pose the SaaSS problem, because accessing someone's published information isn't doing your own computing.  Neither is use of a blog site to publish your own works, or using a microblogging service such as Twitter or StatusN
[23:24:12] <tpefreedom> These services may or may not have other problems, depending on details.) The same goes for other communication not meant to be private, such as chat groups.  In its essence, social networking is a form of communication and publication, not SaaSS.  However, a service whose main facility is social networking can have features or extensions which are SaaSS."

[23:58:54] <bugweiser> bone-baboon, thanks. In al honesty, I fear I wil have forgotten in a year or .. when I might access this channel again. As a well intended suggestion: change the channel's topic title next time "Official FSF Meeting taking place, ends at approx HH:MM GMT"
