[00:13:03] <josevalim> serafeim: yes, we can't do diff tracking inside a list. so everything inside the list is always rendered

[00:13:40] <josevalim> there are two options:
[00:15:11] <josevalim> 1. use temporary assigns and have an ID for each element in the @rendered_board. then you will only store in the `@rendered_board` something you want to change! you will need to add phx-update="append" to `div class="board"`
[00:15:39] <josevalim> 2. put each board element inside a LiveComponent and then you have the LiveComponent manage its state

[00:29:49] <serafeim> thanks josevalim  i'll try to use the temporary assigns way
[00:30:49] <serafeim> i can't understand how it will work though (i.e the first time the temporary assigns will have 10 000 elements - after each update it will have 1-2 elements)... but i'll trust you

[04:27:26] <hoppity> Hi guys, I have some heavy tables (about 20 MB) that look kind of weird for the users as they seem to load a row at a time and kind of shift and move around as the data that populates each row is arriving at the client. Are there any recommended or best-practice ways to improve this experience for the user?

[23:50:52] <fub> srfsh: I cant do this in a pipeline, right?
[23:52:11] <srfsh> I have no idea.  I think you can use as the first item in the pipeline though.
[23:53:13] <mouseghost> fub, you could define a function and then use it in a pipeline afaik
[23:53:25] <fub> ok
[23:53:53] <mouseghost> idk if pipeline accepts lambda functions hm
[23:53:56] <mouseghost> but maybe it does
[23:55:41] <srfsh> mouseghost: seems like there's Kernel.then/2 for that.
