[00:05:02] <InPhase> nomagno: In C this was historically doing with a void* that's reinterpreted to a struct of the needed type for a particular function.  This way you're not wasting 40kB or so per call.  But just be aware this is a bit of a maintenance hazard with coupled dependencies.  Although that maintenance hazard is not avoidable in C by any approach to this, which is why I was suggesting a more modern solution.
[00:06:33] <InPhase> The reinterpreted void* solution will however be better than the unstructured packing into giant arrays of types, because at least once you shove it into a struct type matching each function call you have something where the data is named.

[00:09:09] <InPhase> If you ever mismatch what struct type you pass in as a void* you will of course get various forms of undefined behavior.  But this will occur under any C solution to this with mismatched setup of the call, as there is no good provision for type checking of this in C.

[00:24:19] <CalimeroTeknik> pyzozord, it's not the difference that's interesting, it's to say what each thing is. "polymorphism" means you can have several routines of the same name with only different parameter types that distinguish them; Liskov substitution is that you can use a Cat when an Animal is required: it works, it's still an animal

[00:35:02] <pyzozord> ah so what you describe is "ad hoc polymorphism". What I describe is "subtype polymorphism". Looks like class instances, is only way way to do "subtype polymorphism", for example virtual functions are another. There are also some other ways to do it that I don't understand. And finally there is whole third category called "Parametric polymorphism" and apparently generics are in it
[00:35:16] <pyzozord> wth, that is much more broad and complex than I thought
[00:36:03] <pyzozord> essentially looks like polymorphism is the idea of "I can use all kinds of things as long as they meet condition x"
[00:36:22] <pyzozord> where "condition x" can be ad hoc, a sybtype, or parametric
[00:36:53] <pyzozord> that sounds very functional and very type theory
[00:37:11] <tomathy> i've got a great question
[00:37:14] <Flonk> parametric polymorphism is for example a "filter" function that works on lists of any type. Polymorphism literally means "many forms" or something, and in the parametric case the function "changes form" based on the generic parameter that goes in.

[01:07:35] <CalimeroTeknik> my point here is that naming actually makes the program different, because depending on what names you will implement, it's not the same functions at all
[01:07:58] <CalimeroTeknik> overall, the reduced expression is identical in the end, it's just the decomposition that differs
[01:08:23] <CalimeroTeknik> but "the code" did not guide me here, only the names did, and they had to be clear, abstract concepts
[01:08:55] <pyzozord> yes, I often tend to do paradigm 2 and it indeed often ends up as in the exmaple, too dense to be comfortable to read
[01:09:18] <CalimeroTeknik> and so do Haskell people and Lisp people
[01:10:17] <pyzozord> but there is a balance to strike there, reading code takes time, your short term memory is limited in both space and time. You want to be able to read and parse all code that makes up a cohesive idea
[01:11:10] <pyzozord> but on these examples I'm actually not sure which one is faster to read paradigm 2 or paradigm 3
[01:11:35] <pyzozord> it might be that paradigm 3 is actually faster to read because parsing is very natural
[01:11:46] <arahael> CalimeroTeknik: haskell people, i think, make the names of the types very important. but type names tend to be ommitted in python.

[01:54:42] <ollie> Nvm, they just oscillate.
[01:55:16] <flakland> that's the guy with the bag on his head
[01:55:20] <ollie> Which is good because it means if you can find a cosine equation similar to that then you can take the max and min.
[01:55:22] <Guest39> linear solution of eternity is infinite darwin called it evolution
[01:55:58] <Jynx> ollie how do you find such consine equation
[01:56:34] <Guest39> i find math too safe
[01:56:40] <Guest39> there is no danger in math
[01:56:53] <ollie> I don't know. You can maybe look at taylor series expansion. It may not be possible, but I'm just saying that the terms oscillate, i.e. they form a graph that looks like a cosine. But maybe I'm wrong, idk. It's worth an approach.

[01:59:35] <ollie> Okay, it does oscillate, but when it gets close to 0 it becomes very large. So 0.000001 gives a large negative and -0.000001 gives a large positive.
[01:59:44] <ollie> So cosine may not be the best approach.

By making these recordings Taylor Swift is kind of saturating the market, but also people are going to want to use the 'Taylor's Version' recordings.

[03:23:11] <apotheon> I blame the way pointers are handled in C books, programming courses, et cetera.
[03:23:26] <quazimodo> whatsupdoc: the bit that helped me understand is that a monad in haskel isn't just a datatype or whatever, but it actually may have some computation occur when you interact with it
[03:23:35] <vdamewood> apotheon: Like the completely pointless int i; int *p = &i;
[03:23:57] <sonny> better syntax would help
[03:23:59] <apotheon> vdamewood: She's not as much to my taste.  Some of it's fine, but there was that "indie girl voice with processed vocals" period that I found downright boring and annoying.
[03:24:07] <vdamewood> Personally, I think that malloc should be introduced with pointers in the books.
[03:24:08] <quazimodo> eg the monad that is used to read user data actually will go & run some "unsafe" code in a thread or something and then take the content & throw it into your code in a "safe" way
[03:24:11] <apotheon> 23:53 < vdamewood> apotheon: Like the completely pointless int i; int *p = &i;
[03:24:14] <apotheon> fuck yes

[03:27:06] <quazimodo> whatsupdoc: any time something not "concrete" comes along, such as a variable number of elements in a list, user input, network IO, in fact any IO, monads are used because the monad datatype itself is absolutely concrete, and then by 'pulling stuff out of it' you can get concrete types easily.
[03:27:18] <apotheon> I have been called "gentleman and a scholar" more times than I'm comfortable with -- by people who knew me well enough to know I carry verbal armament.
[03:27:21] <[itchyjunk]> for example, googling list of verbs gives some nice results
[03:27:29] <apotheon> "the fuck word" is a nice way to put it
[03:27:39] <[itchyjunk]> Which is the fuck word?
[03:27:42] <apotheon> 23:57 < c2a1> It's kind of unprofessional
[03:27:45] <c2a1> Dropping the f bomb is for when you're at a bar. Irc is not a bar
[03:27:45] <apotheon> depends on your profession
[03:27:48] <quazimodo> eg the IO type is concrete, then you 'pull stuff out' and the haskel machine runs off & asks user for input, then gives you either a Nothing or a Just String sort of thing (im rusty in hask)
[03:27:55] <c2a1> Libera and freenode especially
[03:27:58] <quazimodo> i shouldn't say concrete
[03:28:15] <apotheon> quazimodo: nice re: concreteness and monads

[03:28:48] <TonyStone> [itchyjunk] yeah i found some such files but i will need to process them a bit
[03:29:05] <quazimodo> eg you can take a function that is build to work on strings, and then combine it automagically with the IO which isn't astring, and you'll get string transformation of whatever got pulled out of the IO

[03:31:06] <vdamewood> To be honest, I think I stole it from some song lyrics.
[03:31:19] <quazimodo> take a "function myFunc(argument: a) => b" where a & b are different types, and the "var myVar: IO(a)" where IO is an IO type wrapping a type, then you can use myFunc directly on myVar using a special operator to get an IO(b) sort of thing

[04:29:38] <apotheon> A patent system naturally evolves toward covering things that are essentially obvious, so that any supposed benefits in the original concept are overwhelmed by massive friction in innovation across society, and patents themselves are essentially a system of prior restraint, which is fucking awful.

[04:30:08] <apotheon> [economics]
[04:30:10] <[itchyjunk]> A patent system doesn't encode information about the evolution of a social system.
[04:30:13] <[itchyjunk]> Which economics?
[04:30:47] <[itchyjunk]> Maybe you're complaining about social systems packaged as patents.
[04:30:55] <[itchyjunk]> Idea of ledger cannot be patented.
[04:31:00] <[itchyjunk]> Yet specific blockchains might be.
[04:31:16] <[itchyjunk]> But you can still have infinitely many implementations.
[04:31:22] <[itchyjunk]> Without exhausting the space of patents.

[04:31:42] <[itchyjunk]> But if you want another literal Bitcoin or somesuch, it is meant to be expensive for some times.
[04:32:35] <[itchyjunk]> Generalizing from blockchains, you can still compete in different distributed ledgers.
[04:33:00] <[itchyjunk]> Large companies like IBM have some distributed ledger technology based patent.
[04:33:27] <[itchyjunk]> The chances that your implementation matches their to the dot is low if your innovating it ground up.
[04:33:33] <apotheon> Economic incentives drive centralization of economic power in a system of granted monopolies, which causes incumbents to arise with the economic (and thus political) power to influence regulatory agencies and legislation, and the courts through high-priced lawyers, leading to increases in the power of patents, creating a self-feeding system of growing control.
[04:33:39] <[itchyjunk]> But if someone is reverse engineering their tech to make one, it should be expensive.
[04:33:45] <apotheon> . . . and much of that control is expanding scope of patents.
[04:33:51] <[itchyjunk]> No, economic incentives can drive any number of things.
[04:33:57] <[itchyjunk]> It depends on the incentives.
[04:34:04] <apotheon> sorry about delays; multitasking
[04:34:13] <InPhase> apotheon: Patent systems do not need to evolve toward covering things that are obvious.  When this happens it is a structural flaw in the review process, which seems to source from examiners not having specific backgrounds in the area of the patent required to evaluate obviousness to a person skilled in the specific area's state of the art.
[04:34:17] <[itchyjunk]> Car industries were incentivized to decentralize.
[04:34:29] <[itchyjunk]> Produce parts across the world and assembe it somewhere else.
[04:34:37] <[itchyjunk]> This was a result of taxation changes.

[04:35:06] <[itchyjunk]> Now, there is an incentive to centralize due to how the cost per part and tax has changed.
[04:35:13] <InPhase> apotheon: An obvious resolution to this is to open up a feedback period under which other people skilled in the art can submit disputes regarding obviousness or prior art before the patent is granted.
[04:35:33] <[itchyjunk]> I think you're complaining about some specific social system using patent in a bad way. Which I admit, for example, USA, does.

[04:38:29] *** Joins: dsrt^ (~dsrt@68.101.63.101)
[04:38:41] <InPhase> apotheon: The core reason obvious patents are filed is because if you manage to slip it past, it is expensive and long for someone to even try to dispute it in court after it is granted.  This makes the calculation favorable to try to submit it even if the odds of receiving it are low.  This incentive is removed by such a feedback period before granting where people can freely submit objections.  
[04:38:47] <InPhase> This would end up making it not worth it to even try to submit obvious patents or ones with prior art.

[09:10:11] <Gamah> the output before "dealer and players" is the value of the card coming out of the "shoe" (think, stack of decks) so you can imagine... players get cards per hand until they bust/stand... then the dealer gets the rest of the cards.... it's obviously printed out of order because debugging
[09:11:10] <Gamah> Raziel: i don't think this is very complex as far as things can be in something in c++.... but i'm also a DBA by day... so you tell me if it's complex or not. i'm sure i'm doing lots of things wrong :)
[09:12:37] <Raziel> Gamah, there's a h.total == h.total / 2; in tests.cpp

[09:14:05] <Gamah> it should probably be in .gitignore until i learn how to properly implement unit tests.

[09:22:11] <Raziel> what does your output represent though? like, I get the final state, but what about the list of numbers? logically I'd assume it's the actions/cards in order 
[09:22:51] <Gamah> yeah shoe.getcard() just cout's the value of the card as dealt
[09:23:04] <Gamah> so you have to logically imagine the hand being dealt, player taking turn, then dealer taking turn
[09:23:23] <Raziel> Right. I guess it'd be clearer for debugging if you also output what the action is, and whose turn it is

[09:23:54] <Gamah> in the first case in the gist, it looks like it played correctly... aces were split and not played after split (a rule of blackjack) in the second case it looks like the player illegally split 4 times by not having matching cards, and i think some cards don't even show up in the output. i forget in this specific example but it's happened in other runs
[09:24:26] <Gamah> yeah i might just have to throw in more debug prints, ugh

[09:26:39] <beaky> apotheon: when i quit it says 'are you sure you want to close X tabs'

[09:27:19] <Raziel> Gamah, well I don't see any randomness in the decision stuff. So the only randomness in the whole thing is the order of the cards, no?
[09:27:33] <Gamah> correct
[09:27:35] <Raziel> Everything else should run the same way every time for that given order of cards then

[12:03:40] <user51> good day
[12:04:00] <lockywolf> arahael, extending arrays is a fairly typical thing
[12:04:14] <arahael> lockywolf: It's really not.
[12:04:30] <lockywolf> for example, you may want to compute some statistic on the vector elements
[12:04:46] <lockywolf> or get a vector of projections
[12:05:14] <arahael> lockywolf: I'd use a function, or an extension method, or perhaps wrap it using composition, depending on the programming methodoogy you're using.
[12:05:21] <user51> do tuples in python map to binary trees?
[12:05:21] <lockywolf> so you want to have the memory management of vector, but domain-specific knowledge of your extended type

[12:09:08] <lockywolf> I guess, both options are better than drinking H2O2, but not that much.
[12:10:28] <arahael> lockywolf: Not all of them, only the ones you want to exopse.
[12:10:29] <arahael> *expose
[12:10:47] <lockywolf> well, I have no idea which ones I want to expose
[12:10:47] <arahael> lockywolf: Alternatively, just define a free-standing function that operates on vector, much like the C++ algorithms library do.
[12:11:01] <arahael> All the more reason to constrain it!
[12:11:13] <arahael> As a developer, you need to keep your scope and interfaces to a miniimum, otherwise it becomes unmanageable.
[12:11:17] <lockywolf> indeed, that is what I am doing now. Which requires the function to know the insides of the vector memebers

[14:37:40] <user51>  CalimeroTeknik: i imagine forth could do the decoupling. but really my idea is that you have a bunch of functions and you're organizing them just right.
[14:37:56] <Gamah> arahael: i'm just proud i made it to the list. i'm not proud how i made it there..
[14:38:02] <aoei\Chickatrice> Gamah: its not loading :<

[14:39:17] <CalimeroTeknik> user51, I don't see how forth would help any more or less than any other language when it comes to decoupling, which happens a level of abstraction higher. What do you mean by "organizing" functions?

[14:50:13] <CalimeroTeknik> user51, "Coupling describes the degree of dependency between one entity to another entity." is not a good definition of decoupling, much in the way that "we will use Scrum" is not agility; decoupling is about managing to solve your problem with an assembly of small solution pieces that combine greatly
[14:50:50] * aoei\Chickatrice wonders if changing DNS will let her access to bash.org
[14:50:52] <CalimeroTeknik> user51, here is a form of decoupling (between program 2 and 3) http://ix.io/3DHa

[14:50:54] <user51> CalimeroTeknik: yeah, your definition isgood
[14:51:48] <lantech19446> aoei\Chickatrice: why would DNS be stopping you?
[14:52:02] <aoei\Chickatrice> dunno
[14:52:04] <aoei\Chickatrice> something is
[14:52:05] <Gamah> DNS: A haiku...
[14:52:07] <Gamah> It's not DNS
[14:52:12] <Gamah> There's no way it's DNS
[14:52:14] <CalimeroTeknik> user51, "degree of dependency" isn't even relevant to decoupling; the method I illustrate with descriptive naming chooses to work on the program considering that a lot of concepts are available (and if they're not, implement them separately)
[14:52:15] <Gamah> It was DNs...
[14:52:17] <aoei\Chickatrice> Gamah: XD
[14:52:24] <aoei\Chickatrice> i saw that before somewhere
[14:52:29] <lantech19446> It's always Dns lol
[14:52:32] <Gamah> that's because itls almost always DNS
[14:52:45] <CalimeroTeknik> user51, however genericity is relevant to decoupling. the small solution pieces must solve general problems, e.g. "sum" is a good one
[14:53:11] <lantech19446> I was having this weird issue with 2 workstations going down constantly I tried everything even rebuild and here it wound up being ptr records
[14:54:06] <Gamah> you never really truely learn how slow the internet is until you need to change a dns record
[14:54:15] <lantech19446> aoei\Chickatrice:  try pinging bash.org if it's DNS it should come up with a resolve error
[14:54:22] <aoei\Chickatrice> true
[14:54:33] <aoei\Chickatrice> nope it times out
[14:54:39] <Gamah> vpn/proxy?
[14:54:40] <CalimeroTeknik> user51, what the stackexchange post clumsily tries to reach, is actually this principle: when you implement some piece of solution, e.g. sum(), you must absolutely not concern yourself of what it will be used for
[14:54:49] <lantech19446> Can you ping out otherwise?
[14:54:52] <Gamah> bash.org gets attacked a lot...
[14:55:16] <CalimeroTeknik> user51, it's very hard to ignore what you will be using a helper function for, and extremely tempting to adapt it to your use case, but resist that

[15:01:40] <CalimeroTeknik> user51, what you said is correct but inapplicable! if you want to design something that will be decoupled, you must imagine what components you need for it; and try not to require components dedicated to your use case
[15:01:45] <aoei\Chickatrice> arahael: i didn't eat anything *cooked by me* yesterday
[15:01:56] <arahael> aoei\Chickatrice: Heh...
[15:01:59] <aoei\Chickatrice> there was old definitely bad food in the kitchen but i didnt touch it
[15:02:10] <aoei\Chickatrice> im wondering if the wine i had had gone off or something
[15:02:14] <aoei\Chickatrice> it was open for ages
[15:02:16] <aoei\Chickatrice> lol
[15:02:22] <aoei\Chickatrice> tasted a bit weird too
[15:02:22] <Gamah> mmmm wine
[15:02:27] <Gamah> i haven't had wine in ages.
[15:02:35] <arahael> aoei\Chickatrice: I suppose it's possible but I don't think wine gets bad that way. I mean, it does go off, but I don't know if wine goes unsafe (does it?)
[15:02:47] <aoei\Chickatrice> well thats what i thought too but
[15:02:56] <Gamah> most fermented things don't go unsafe, lest they become more fermented
[15:02:58] <arahael> aoei\Chickatrice: Food poisoning can be delayed, too.
[15:03:01] <aoei\Chickatrice> i mean one can also get food poisoning from ordered pizza

[15:03:49] <aoei\Chickatrice> idk
[15:03:54] <aoei\Chickatrice> but i feel not so bad now
[15:03:55] <CalimeroTeknik> user51, the point is that you'll be proposing an assembly of components that solves the problem, but it's infeasible to "break things down to components" once they're already built, unless it's an in-place rebuild that progressively "conquers" the codebase with a decoupled architecture
[15:04:03] <arahael> aoei\Chickatrice: Glad to hear! :)  Time for more nethack? ;)
[15:04:07] <aoei\Chickatrice> i basically just vomited my dinner in the morning when i went to shower

[15:04:18] <aoei\Chickatrice> and get some rest instead
[15:04:51] <arahael> Sensible.
[15:05:05] <CalimeroTeknik> user51, first find an architecture for your system that is decoupled, then just implement that, and you can progressively Frankenstein that into the legacy system until it turns into the new one

[15:24:05] <pyzozord> oh and i forgot the important part: without changing how it behaves
[15:24:20] <pyzozord> refactoring changes structure of the code without changing it's behaviour
[15:24:25] <aoei\Chickatrice> yeah exactly
[15:24:43] <Gamah> i think behavior can be included in refactoring 
[15:24:44] <pyzozord> practically people often say they refactor when really they refactor and fix/improve at the same time
[15:24:45] <aoei\Chickatrice> but in more casual discussions we'll talk about various “refactorings” that do absolutely change behaviour
[15:24:54] <aoei\Chickatrice> pyzozord: right

[16:23:25] <merijn> ProfSimm: You wanna google "paraconsistent logics"
[16:23:26] <ProfSimm> aradesh, in three valued logic we need three inputs and three outcomes, true/undefined/false. So maybe yes

[16:30:47] <merijn> ProfSimm: Ah, rats, can't see the book in my bookcase
[16:31:26] <pyzozord> btw what is the temporal logic usful for?
[16:31:35] <merijn> pyzozord: Temporal logic is logic in which the "truth of things" varies over time
[16:31:52] <merijn> pyzozord: Consider the statement "Pluto is a planet" is this true or false?
[16:32:01] <merijn> It's false *now*
[16:32:11] <merijn> But it used to be true, before we changed the definition of planet
[16:32:24] <pyzozord> ok so sounds like it's useful in real time algorithms?

[16:32:31] <vdamewood> merijn: Is vdamewood alive. True now. Won't be true in 200 years. <-- that?
[16:32:39] <ProfSimm> merijn, so i guess this is more accurately called "causal logic"

[16:32:51] <norias> I prefer Casual Logic
[16:32:59] <merijn> vdamewood: Pretty much
[16:32:59] <ProfSimm> Yup
[16:33:04] <ProfSimm> Time has direction, but no measure
[16:33:10] <ProfSimm> In absolute terms
[16:33:15] <merijn> Paraconsistent logics are logics that allow for contradiction
[16:33:19] <pyzozord> those things are little bit like domain specific languages, aren't they?
[16:33:30] <merijn> This ruins most of the power to proof things, but can be important for modelling things
[16:33:33] <ProfSimm> merijn I think the only way for contradiction is non-interaction between contradicting parts
[16:33:48] <pyzozord> this is language for logic over time, this is language for normal logic, this is language for numbers, that is language for variables, that is language for fractions
[16:34:06] <ProfSimm> merijn, basically we can think of every self-consistent artifact in isolation. It's consistent, another is not consistent with the first, but also is self-consistent
[16:34:21] <merijn> For example "Taylor Swift's music is great" <- some people believe this statement is true, some believe it is false. If you need to model both types of people in one logical system, your system needs to be able to handle contradiction like that
[16:34:42] <ProfSimm> merijn, we can handle it through extra dimensions (in math sense, as in a vector)
[16:35:05] <ProfSimm> merijn, basically there's a "knot" in their vector that flips true to false. And would explain why they like or not like her music

[21:23:00] <pyzozord> but mah procedure vs function that's not interesting discussion, disassembly of this thing and why and how compilers accept it, that's interesting
[21:23:25] <CalimeroTeknik> pyzozord, your interests might differ from others' :)
[21:23:28] <apotheon> CalimeroTeknik: My impression is that you're talking about C.  Shouldn't C's main() only return the program's return value -- making it a function?
[21:23:49] <CalimeroTeknik> it's a (pure) function if it does only that, yes
[21:23:51] <apotheon> . . . or are you playing around with returning strings from main()?
[21:23:54] <pyzozord> CalimeroTeknik: true, I spoke too soon
[21:24:08] <InPhase> apotheon: main is a somewhat special function.
[21:24:12] <adder> anyone can guess what this does in Python? `list(iter(int, 1))`
[21:24:17] <apotheon> CalimeroTeknik: It could also call other functions.
[21:24:37] <CalimeroTeknik> which is similar to having them inlined

[21:43:23] <pyzozord> it must be like a fork and exec syscalls at least right?
[21:43:50] <pyzozord> i'm considering if it was possible to hide a system("rm -rf /") in that code
[21:44:06] <GeDaMo> "The system() library function uses fork(2) to create a child process that executes the shell command specified in command using execl(3)"

[21:47:56] <sonny> doesn't have permissions I think
[21:48:14] <Decker> then arbitrary things like rm -rf / *and accidentally hit enter* doesn't destroy your system

[23:40:05] <kveroneau> A hash is one way.

[23:40:43] <user51> lol, functions returning function pointers can be funny in c

[23:42:44] <Hash> Kind of. It adds additional noise so it's not the same.
[23:42:59] <tomathy> how do you store the salt? Hash 
[23:43:10] <[itchyjunk]> you don't store the salt
[23:43:17] <vdamewood> You do store the salt.
[23:43:18] <[itchyjunk]> you code salts the input before it hashes it

[23:43:50] <Hash> Salts can also be derived, from an algorith
[23:43:53] <vdamewood> tomathy: Just make sure the salt is unique to each user, and that it's at least as long as the hash output.

[23:44:37] <Hash> tomathy: username hash is predictable.

[23:44:48] <[itchyjunk]> tomathy, you use a different hashing function sometimes to generate the salt unique to each user
[23:45:15] <[itchyjunk]> maybe they should pepper it too
