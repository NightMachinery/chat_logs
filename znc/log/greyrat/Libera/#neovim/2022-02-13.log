[06:49:26] <romgrkRomGrk[m]> love2d seems more for full-fledged games. I need something simple that can create bitmaps from simple commands, like the canvas API in the browser or like cairo but quickly usable in lua. it's to integrate graphics into neovim through the kitty graphics protocol
[06:52:00] <Bowuigi[m]> Cairo has Lua bindings

[12:45:05] <sunjonSenghanBri> I don't understand the question. Which gui, what particular aspect is associated with kitty's keyboard protocol? what do GUI's have to do with kitty/foot term?
[12:46:18] *** Joins: jstein (~jstein@gentoo/developer/jstein)
[12:47:28] <leiserfg[m]> in tui you can't map  ctrl+shift (as it's swallowed by the terminal)  but if in gui you can then it means (n)vim is capable of handling those already
[12:48:19] <leiserfg[m]> meaning nvim could handle this protocol as for instance  kakoune does  
[12:48:57] <leiserfg[m]> that could allow using shortcuts as ctr+esc  for instance

[12:54:14] <leiserfg[m]> no, my point (which is a question not a claim) is if it can do in the gui, it means the "piping" (like event types/handling and so) is already in place, and no, it won't be a new way for doing the same, as the "kitty protocol" exposes key combinations that are not accessible in the "classic" terminal protocol

[12:55:16] <leiserfg[m]> I know, that's what I'm saying
[12:55:32] <leiserfg[m]> if the UI works with complex shortcut 
[12:55:43] <leiserfg[m]> then it means the piping is  there already 
[12:56:36] *** Quits: jacky (~jacky@47.202.64.169) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[12:56:56] <leiserfg[m]> so the new protocol could be added to nvim to make it possible to use the "kitty protocol"  in terminals that have it (as far as I know kitty, foot and I think iTerm2) 
[12:59:29] <bbrtj> does anyone know how to properly set up vim-repeat if my mapping does insert mode? I made a function that calls startinsert and sets up autocmd on InsertLeave which calls repeat#set, but hitting dot seems to do all the stuff including startinsert but not the insertion itself
[12:59:55] <leiserfg[m]> going over gh I see there is an open issue already 
[12:59:55] <leiserfg[m]> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14400
[13:01:31] <clason[m]> Neovim (through libtermkey) is already able to distinguish special keys -- this is not a matter of protocol but of the terminal itself
[13:01:48] <clason[m]> for example, pangoterm can distinguish them just fine, and then they work in Neovim out of the box

[14:40:05] <Guest455> `if has (gui_running)
[14:40:09] <Guest455> Welp
[14:40:15] <sunjonSenghanBri> everything there should(have been) be configurable by the styles - and there's only one style atm
[14:40:52] <sunjonSenghanBri> (so that part's hardcoded)
[14:41:16] <Guest455> `set guifont=FiraCode NF:h12` is working only till one session. If I restart Neovim, it no longer works
[14:42:18] <Guest455> Same with, `:colorscheme ayu` -I have to manually type this command every time
[14:43:13] <sunjonSenghanBri> what's the filename/path of the config file you have these commands in?
[14:43:39] <Guest455> in `/home/usr/.config/nvom
[14:43:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> and do you happen to know what became of Guest454?
[14:43:51] <Guest455> *nvim
[14:43:59] <Guest455> Nope, what do you mean?
[14:44:29] <sunjonSenghanBri> your name, 'Guest455' - I'd assumed you were related, but nevermind
[14:44:55] <Guest455> Nope. I enteref as Guest45, but it said that Guest45 is already in use and then it assigned me Guest455
[14:45:02] <Guest455> *entered
[14:45:18] <sunjonSenghanBri> so, what's the filename?
[14:45:24] <Guest455> init.vim
[14:45:50] <sunjonSenghanBri> are any of the other commands you specify there working?
[14:45:58] <Guest455> Yes
[14:46:25] <Guest455> All other commands are working fine except the ones for font and colorscheme
[14:46:42] <sunjonSenghanBri> what does `:verb set guifont` say?
[14:47:48] <Guest455> Okay, so I had set the guifont using `:set guifont=*` and then `:put = &guifont` -- but the change is temporary
[14:48:14] <sunjonSenghanBri> what is `*`?
[14:48:24] <Guest455> It gives a gui menu to select fonts
[14:48:56] <sunjonSenghanBri> try using a ginit.vim file
[14:49:07] <sunjonSenghanBri> instead of your `if has(gui_running)`
[14:49:14] <sunjonSenghanBri> put your gui specific config in that
[14:49:18] <sunjonSenghanBri> `:h gui`
[14:49:31] <nvim-bot[m]> * [`gui`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/gui.html#gui) in *gui.txt*
[14:49:45] <Guest455> Also `:set guifont=FiraCode_NF:h12' says unknown font...
[14:50:03] <Guest455> Alright. I will copy the commands into a gnit.vim file
[14:50:29] <sunjonSenghanBri> then it's probably incorrectly named?
[14:50:44] <sunjonSenghanBri> get the string from `fc-list`
[14:51:02] <Guest455> Well, it's working on doing that `set guifont=*` thing
[14:51:37] <Guest455> Â I'm currently not on PC btw
[14:52:46] <Guest455> Even `:set guifont= Source_Code_Pro:h12` says unknown font
[14:53:10] <clason[m]> does the font name really have underscores?
[14:53:34] <sunjonSenghanBri> yeah, you need to see what the system knows the font as
[14:53:50] <sunjonSenghanBri> not guess as to whether you compact spaces, or replace them with underscores
[14:53:58] <clason[m]> if they're actually spaces, you'd write it as `Source\ Code\ Pro:h12`
[14:54:07] <clason[m]> at least on posix
[14:54:08] <sunjonSenghanBri> my Fira Code fonts for example, are listed with actual spaces
[14:54:26] <Guest455> On Vim, it's working fine with the underscores too
[14:54:26] <sunjonSenghanBri> `/usr/share/fonts/TTF/FiraCode-Regular.ttf: Fira Code:style=Regular`
[14:54:31] <Guest455> Ah
[14:55:55] <Guest455> My terminal setup is working perfectly because I directly set the terminal font to Fira Code NF. I can't get it working for my GUI setup though.

[16:27:42] <clason[m]> so I'd recommend reading their docs on how to set these things up (especially for Windows)
[16:27:59] <Guest455> The problem is that it's not recognizing the guifont...
[16:28:02] <Guest455> The config is working fine
[16:28:22] <clason[m]> that would not be _my_ definition of "working fine"...
[16:29:03] <Guest455> The rest of the commands are working fine though. Only two are not working as they should.
[16:29:18] <Guest455> 1. `set guifont` and `colorscheme ayu`
[16:29:37] <clason[m]> which I'd be surprised if they were related
[16:30:43] <clason[m]> so let's ignore the GUI for now (which I can't help with anyway) and look at the colorscheme issue
[16:30:58] <Guest455> I have to manually enter these commands in order to get the desired result, which is not an ideal optimization.
[16:31:01] <clason[m]> and try to get it working in terminal
[16:31:10] <Guest455> Yep, so it's not working in terminal either
[16:31:14] <clason[m]> well, yes, clearly something is wrong
[16:31:29] <Guest455> IfÂ  I run, `:colorscheme ayu` then it works fine
[16:31:36] <clason[m]> guifont won't work in the terminal, of course -- that's between you and your GUI, nothing to do with Neovim
[16:31:52] <Guest455> Yeah, but I have opened `nvim-qt` also
[16:32:03] <clason[m]> well, don't do that then
[16:32:11] <clason[m]> at least for the purpose of this discussion
[16:32:27] <Guest455> Done
[16:32:41] <clason[m]> ok. so you start `nvim` from the terminal
[16:32:48] <Guest455> Yep
[16:33:08] <clason[m]> first question: what _exactly_ do you mean by "the colorscheme is not working"
[16:34:25] <Guest455> The theme can be changed on using the manual commands, but if I run nvim again, the theme resets back to default
[16:34:31] <Guest455> _omit on
[16:34:41] <clason[m]> Ignore the "manual command"
[16:34:47] <Guest455> Okay
[16:34:49] <clason[m]> we just want to look at your config
[16:34:58] <Guest455> I have `colorscheme ayu` in the config too
[16:35:26] <clason[m]> so, if you started `nvim`, what does `:colorscheme` say
[16:35:38] <Guest455> default
[16:35:58] <clason[m]> ok, what does `:scriptnames` say
[16:35:59] *** Quits: pun (~weechat@user/pun) (Quit: pun)
[16:36:19] <Guest455> It gives a list of all the plugins installed
[16:36:46] <clason[m]> don't need to copy it here; does it a) include your `init.vim` where you set `colorscheme ayu` and b) `ayu.vim`?
[16:37:22] <Guest455> `init.vim` is present in the lists, but not `ayu.vim`
[16:37:25] <Guest455> *list
[16:37:51] <clason[m]> can you put that `init.vim` in a pastebin and link it here?

[16:43:58] <Guest455> I have a question: does Neovim load the commands in the sequence in which they're defined?
[16:44:06] <clason[m]> yes, of course
[16:44:16] <Guest455> That's a new concept I learned today
[16:44:26] <clason[m]> really?
[16:44:29] <Guest455> Yeah
[16:44:39] <clason[m]> how else would it work? 
[16:44:56] <Guest455> I thought it worked irrespective of the order of the commands
[16:45:08] <Guest455> Also, do you know the location of the `plugged` folder in WSL?
[16:45:16] <clason[m]> no
[16:45:26] <Guest455> Okay
[16:45:36] <clason[m]> Guest455: and what would have been the basis of that thought? ;)
[16:45:43] <clason[m]> (except wishful thinking?)
[16:46:20] <Guest455> Which thought?
[16:46:38] <rjarry> ii14[m]: you think it could be related to the terminal?
[16:46:41] <clason[m]> that the order of commands doesn't matter
[16:47:08] <Guest455> I thought it worked like a compiled language
[16:47:15] <Guest455> which is absolutely not true
[16:47:25] <clason[m]> even in a compiled language, commands are executed in order
[16:47:36] <clason[m]> if they were not, total madness would result

[16:48:26] <clason[m]> (a compiler may _change_ the order if it knows that it can get the same result more quickly that way -- but that's a big "if")
[16:49:33] <Guest455> nvm
[16:50:28] <clason[m]> so, yeah, TL;DR: you have to "load" a plugin before you can make use of it in your config
[16:50:43] <Guest455> Yep
[16:50:50] <Guest455> I can't find the plugged folder tho
[16:51:12] <Guest455> On Windows, it's in `AppData\Local\nvim-data`
[16:51:17] <clason[m]> but that is true in Vim as well, so I'm a bit confused how that config could have worked before
[16:51:33] <Guest455> It's working fine in Vim.
[16:51:47] <clason[m]> I highly doubt that ;)
[16:52:01] <Guest455> Well, I'm not lying. You could see my setup

[16:52:45] <Voidwarper> hello is neovim stable enough to be used as default $EDITOR in linux?

[16:52:52] <Guest455> I believe so
[16:53:03] <Voidwarper> or should i use vim as system editor and neovim as personal editor?
[16:53:46] <clason[m]> You'll have to read the vim-plug documentation to find out the default directory for plugins
[16:53:57] <Guest455> As a new user who's recently made a transition to Neovim, I've not had many problems with Neovim so far Voidwarper
[16:54:03] <clason[m]> `:scriptnames` should tell you as well where exactly it sourced the plugins from
[16:54:07] <Guest455> Okay
[16:54:13] <ii14[m]> rjarry: probably not then, just check if vanilla vim does the same thing

[16:55:28] <rjarry> it does
[16:55:35] <rjarry> I am using the same config
[16:55:42] <clason[m]> that is handled differently in Neovim and Vim (Neovim has deprecated `t_co` options which you might rely on to get this working under Vim)
[16:55:46] <ii14[m]> not SpecialKey, `:hi Whitespace`
[16:55:52] <rjarry> I am sourcing my vimrc from ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
[16:56:12] <ii14[m]> is this the default colorscheme?
[16:56:27] <clason[m]> yeah, but there's big differences between Neovim and Vim, so using the same config is not a guarantee for the same behavior
[16:56:33] <ii14[m]> if so it still might be different
[16:56:34] <rjarry> no https://git.sr.ht/~rjarry/dotfiles/tree/main/item/vim/colors/tir_black.vim

[16:58:21] <rjarry> is that neovim specific?

[16:59:00] <Voidwarper> why hasn't neovim releases a major version yet? and its version is 0.x etc
[16:59:49] <rjarry> hl-Whitespace not available in vanilla vim
[16:59:53] <clason[m]> why does it have to?
[16:59:56] <ii14[m]> vim 8.0 doesn't have that, don't know about newer versions
[17:00:05] <clason[m]> no, it's not in Vim
[17:00:14] <rjarry> I'll define both hl
[17:00:34] <rjarry> thanks for your help
[17:00:38] <Voidwarper> does it mean not having a major release yet, that the developers think its beta software?

[17:00:55] <clason[m]> Voidwarper: wdym?
[17:01:40] <Voidwarper> clason[m]: usually if i see software with version 0.6 or something i think its beta software. if its after 1.0 like 1.6 i think its more tested
[17:01:44] <Voidwarper> is this wrong assumption?
[17:01:53] <clason[m]> it is a wrong assumption
[17:01:56] <ii14[m]> well it's a fork
[17:02:23] <clason[m]> comparing version numbers across software is meaningless
[17:02:24] <ii14[m]> so you have most stuff you'd have in vim 8
[17:02:42] <ii14[m]> some features can be experimental

[17:05:13] <rjarry> ;)
[17:06:06] <Voidwarper> by the way to compile it should i use luajit or lua5-1
[17:06:12] <clason[m]> luajit
[17:06:13] <ii14[m]> luajit
[17:06:26] <clason[m]> just use the provided build scripts
[17:06:31] <ii14[m]> it's faster and the actually supported version
[17:06:37] <clason[m]> or the appimage
[17:06:38] <Voidwarper> the default on gentoo seems to be lua5-1 for some reason
[17:06:43] <Voidwarper> [ebuild  N     ] app-editors/neovim-0.6.1::gentoo  USE="lto nvimpager tui -test" LUA_SINGLE_TARGET="lua5-1 -luajit" 10,350 KiB
[17:06:43] <clason[m]> yea
[17:06:49] <clason[m]> that's gentoo's problem
[17:07:04] <ii14[m]> I think cmake should download the luajit
[17:07:11] <ii14[m]> not sure tho
[17:07:18] <clason[m]> `:version` should tell you whether it's actually built with LuaJIT
[17:07:56] <ii14[m]> `-luajit`
[17:07:58] <ii14[m]> it's luajit
[17:08:11] <ii14[m]> luajit is based on lua5.1
[17:08:54] <amke[m]> Hi. Question: on what logical foundation should I consider switching to Lua based configs. Is it about optimizing time and space complexities? I have been reading articles stating the Lua based configs are much faster than VimL, but how much is the difference? Should I make a shift to Lua configs if I'm only dealing with small codebases? I'd like to know from you. Thanks.
[17:09:05] <ii14[m]> or does the `-` means that it's disabled?
[17:10:08] <clason[m]> I wouldn't worry about it. It makes very little if any practical difference
[17:10:09] <ii14[m]> amke: shouldn't make much difference for configs
[17:10:21] <Voidwarper> ii14[m]: it means it can use either lua5-1 or luajit, and currently luajit is disabled
[17:10:24] <ii14[m]> if it's just basic stuff
[17:10:40] <ii14[m]> like just set this or other option, set up autocommands etc
[17:11:06] <Voidwarper> maybe i should report it as a bug in gentoo, why the default is lua5-1
[17:11:26] <Voidwarper> do you have any reference i can link to in the bug report?
[17:11:29] <clason[m]> the advantage of Lua over vimscript config is
[17:11:29] <clason[m]> 1. Lua plugins are configured through Lua; that is slightly easier directly from a Lua config
[17:11:29] <clason[m]> 2. Some people _really_ prefer Lua as a language and want to have as little to do with vimscript as possible (which is fine but subjective)
[17:11:36] <Bowuigi[m]> amke[m]: It matters on large plugins maybe, but for configs people is using Lua because Lua is simpler and easier to read than VimScript
[17:12:16] <clason[m]> it's also not all or nothing -- you can have some config files in Lua while keeping others in vimscript
[17:13:01] <ii14[m]> yeah, my config is 50% vim script 50% lua
[17:13:07] <ii14[m]> something like that
[17:14:22] <amke[m]> Thank you. 
[17:17:16] <Guest455> I'd like to add to that question: what's a better option bw `coc.vim` and the LSP support with Lua?

[17:21:16] <Guest455> knowing both sides is really important in order to understand the subject in great depth

[17:42:35] <clason[m]> that's a FAQ just a few lines down
[17:42:42] <Guest455> Ok, nice

[17:44:45] <ii14[m]> just add `!`
[17:44:48] <Guest455> Although I can force it to load the font, it still shouldn't raise that error
[17:45:07] <clason[m]> yeah, but not all monospaced fonts report as such (in all relevant places)

[17:46:03] <Guest455> =L
[17:46:18] <clason[m]> software is weird
[17:46:37] <clason[m]> I'd advise to just roll with it as long as it's working
[17:47:13] <Guest455> It's also working without the '!'

[18:01:25] <Guest455> Correct. I tried both and either one of them works. Thanks everyone
[18:05:12] <Guest455> ----
[18:05:12] <Guest455> Using `:e $MYVIMRC` in `nvim-qt` still opens the `init.vim` file.
[18:05:13] <Guest455> I've sourced the `ginit.vim` file twice.Â  What is the error?
[18:05:39] <ii14[m]> ginit.vim is loaded on top of init.vim
[18:06:26] <Guest455> How do I remove the`init.vim` file then?
[18:07:03] <sunjon[m]> I'd suggested ginit.vim to dodge the suspect guirunning test
[18:07:20] <ii14[m]> why do you want to remove init.vim
[18:08:03] <ii14[m]> init.vim is always loaded, ginit.vim is loaded only when gui is running
[18:08:18] <Guest455> Ah
[18:08:26] <clason[m]> by some GUIs
[18:08:38] <clason[m]> neovim cares not about it
[18:09:25] <Guest455> I'm not sure what to do :(
[18:10:10] <ii14[m]> with what?
[18:10:36] <ii14[m]> I'd just put the Guifont command in ginit.vim
[18:10:42] <ii14[m]> and that's it
[18:11:58] <Guest455> I copied the entire init.vim into the `ginit.vim` file thinking there's no role of the `init.vim` file
[18:12:19] <ii14[m]> don't, put just the Guifont command there
[18:12:24] <clason[m]> that was wrong :)
[18:12:32] <Guest455> Yeah...

[20:31:10] <BennyPowers[m]> how are the neovim nightlies? i have a plugin which requires 0.7.0. worth using as a daily driver?
[20:31:21] <clason[m]> depends
[20:31:40] *** Joins: zer0bitz_ (~zer0bitz@2001:2003:f74d:b800:70e8:bae3:c5b2:7d1d)
[20:31:56] <clason[m]> I (and many others) have been using them as daily drivers just fine, but it does require commitment
[20:32:38] <BennyPowers[m]> commitment of which sort?
[20:32:46] <clason[m]> time and effort
[20:32:48] <mjlbach[m]> A commitment to not complain about breakages :) 
[20:33:14] <clason[m]> if you switch to nightly, you need to stay on nightly (meaning always update to latest master)
[20:33:40] <clason[m]> follow the commit log and breaking changes notifications to be aware 
[20:34:21] <mjlbach[m]> If you update to the nightly, plugins generally assume you are on the latest nightly. They cannot check if you have a given commit, so if there is a nice new feature they will immediately use it
[20:34:23] <clason[m]> have a fallback plan in case there are serious breakages (which are rare and usually fixed very quickly, but they can happen)
[20:34:29] <clason[m]> it's not really recommended for people starting out with Neovim
