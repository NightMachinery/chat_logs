[05:17:04] <hayley> Some people can tell what the program is doing by the bell pattern.
[05:18:31] <gilberth> Not the disk access sound because of thrashing?
[05:18:52] <hayley> That happens when you don't have a GC.
[05:21:44] <gilberth> I must appoint you, a GC on the old generations could bring in pages from disk, not touched for some time.
[05:22:17] <gilberth> * disappoint even
[05:23:18] <hayley> IIRC Berger redeemed himself by implementing a GC which would mark before a page was evicted, thus avoiding paging at the cost of some "incremental" leaking, as AIUI it assumes everything paged out is live.
[05:24:08] <gilberth> Well, as long it sits on the disk, it's cheap to not collect.

[05:27:19] *** Joins: aeth (~aeth@user/aeth)
[05:28:13] <gilberth> Sure, but disk space is many times cheaper than RAM.
[05:28:58] <hayley> Of course, but it is irresponsible to have the user just keep buying drives. Unless you want to GC every 8 years.
[05:30:22] <hayley> .oO( The someone I called a fuckwad said dynamic typing was "irresponsible" too. Is it not more irresponsible to not use a model checker too? Oh, and if the type system has bugs, then you have bigger problems, as you don't get a runtime error. You get UB. )
[05:33:11] <gilberth> hayley: I still like the idea to do bulk GC, when the machine is otherwise idle. When it's a personal workstation it should be idle like 2/3 of the time. After all we humans dream when asleep and do a kind of GC too. Not only in the brain, but also in cells, in general.
[05:33:22] <hayley> Sure.

[05:33:58] <copec> I think people still conflate dynamic with weak typing 
[05:34:09] <copec> Although they wonâ€™t admit it
[05:34:45] <hayley> The example was Elixir, which uses strong types. And recall Robert Virding said hot reloading would be a total PITA with static types.
[05:34:50] <gilberth> The fear of dynamic typing is irrational at best. Just because a datum fits into one of the sets of values you could formulate in a statically typed language, does not make every datum a valid one.
[05:35:41] <hayley> I suppose on BEAM you can have two versions of some module running while doing an upgrade, and so you have to type check the new version with the old version.
[05:35:57] <gilberth> copec: Nah, they are afraid of *gasp* runtime errors. Ironically often they are happy without an integer data type, too.

[05:37:55] <gilberth> copec: C has runtime errors?
[05:38:20] <hayley> Don't type weenies these days use algebraic data types (i.e. compiler checked error codes) and/or total crashes (often called "panic")? A bit rich.
[05:38:38] <gilberth> The only I am aware of is division by zero for C. Is that even guaranteed?
[05:38:45] <copec> The runtime errors Iâ€™m thinking of mean invalid programs with undefined behavior 
[05:39:06] <hayley> (Also n.b. crashing hard works fine on BEAM cause you can make bazillions of green threads, so crashing one won't hurt too badly. But not so much with OS threads.)
[05:39:56] <gilberth> That is not a runtime error to me, but just UB. And you could argue, that C is statically typed, but weak.
[05:40:45] <copec> Iâ€™ll correct what I label as runtime errors
[05:41:17] <copec> Since I defer to you folk being actual programmers :-p
[05:41:51] <gilberth> copec: But you're spot on, that static/dynamic typing and strong/weak typing is always confused. That are orthogonal concepts.
[05:42:55] <hayley> Anyways, back to GCing the disks: yes, I would prefer to have finite storage. But some overhead to concurrent/incremental/now distributed with bookmarking GC is fine.
[05:44:17] <gilberth> The only almost valid argument I heard for static typing is that some potential errors could be found by the compiler. Most static typing advocates however believe once static type analysis is done, there could be no more runtime errors, or ill-specified situations.
[05:46:03] <hayley> I find that what type/argument-count inference SBCL does is enough to find the damn obvious mistakes.

[05:49:41] <hayley> No optimizations are done on that information, just that it complains about it.
[05:51:53] <gilberth> Sure. I was beaten often enough by Python remembering information about types. Once a function always returned NIL e.g. It always would assume that. Or: When I later redefine that function, code compiled with that assumption is not recompiled. I really despite this behaviour, which makes interactive development not reliable. Hence a batch compiler.
[05:53:00] <hayley> Right, IIRC the SBCL notes mentioned disabling that sort of propagation.
[05:53:10] <gilberth> So me must arrange for all functions using another being recompiled. As if everything were declared INLINE or a macro. Warranted by the spec, but annoying.

[05:54:55] <gilberth> hayley: Which notes? It just blames me, that I was so bold to interactivly correct a function. It's still batch oriented, as the only safe course of action is to recompile the whole system after each change. When I wanted that, I would not use CL.
[05:55:20] <hayley> Seems I imagined it, never mind.
[05:55:34] <copec> Thinking about type, like from a Haskell perspective is really interesting, but it implies that you know exactly what you're doing before you do it, where I like staking-out a program and iterating it
[05:55:36] <hayley> Right, SBCL complains if you change the source location but it still works.
[05:56:03] <copec> With CL and a compiler with documented behavior that respects it, you can have both
[05:56:05] <gilberth> When it even would be clever and say: "Listen, you redfined FOO, assumptions used in functions BAR, BAZ, and QUUX on FOO are no longer true." That would be helpful at least.

[06:07:29] <gilberth> Hmm?
[06:08:06] <gilberth> If you ask me, they cling to false beliefs.
[06:08:58] <hayley> Also /me wonders if faster dispatch in SICL would make the SICL compiler any faster. With the register allocation and "assembler" generation passes, and some libraries loaded in, it approaches 100 seconds to bootstrap.
[06:10:42] <hayley> Though it wouldn't hurt to e.g. declare that bit vectors are bit vectors, because then one can use SIMD-within-a-register operations rather than the generic ones.
[06:12:22] <hayley> Also also, couldn't I use the same call-site optimization trick on any ole speculative optimization? Say, I could rather make the "call site" a loop and bring the dispatch out of the loop. Then it becomes more like threaded code.

[08:00:09] <hayley> Either they are, or I got used to having it happen to me enough that I expect it.
[08:00:50] <Gnuxie> Yes, they likely are doing some bs like that 
[08:03:28] <Gnuxie> But at the same time they might be doing it because their audience is children 
[08:04:24] <hayley> idk, it's 1:30pm on a Monday, they don't tend to show kids shows.
[08:05:29] <Gnuxie> Well they might show it as part of a kids show later, I am only trying to hope the reality you suggest is not true 
[08:05:29] <Gnuxie> But maybe it is just horrible 
[08:06:10] <hayley> Fair enough.

[09:05:29] * hayley wonders if "Mathematics for Computing" really should be called "Data science".
[09:06:31] <shka> hayley: honestly, data science is such a pretentious term 
[09:06:51] <shka> i like "mathematics for computing" it sounds like a mission statement 
[09:06:53] <White_Flame> for matching industry, sure.  As a term, "science" is not really applicable to computing
[09:07:12] <hayley> And, goddammit, I know linear regressions - I even hacked a perceptron in Macsyma that one time.
[09:07:28] <shka> literally everyone know linear regression xD
[09:07:40] <hayley> Why do they need a course on it then? :)
[09:08:00] <shka> and there is even logistic regression in there
[09:08:28] <shka> hayley: good question, i would expect it to be already covered before
[09:09:13] <shka> and instead i would put here either other distributions or statistical hypothesis testing here instead 
[09:09:52] <shka> though perhaps it is not so important for programmers
[09:09:52] <hayley> Time to RIIP (Rewrite It In Petalisp)?
[09:09:53] <hayley> And then it is rather using Python modules to do the regression anyway.
[09:10:42] <shka> it seems that everyone assumes that performance distribution is always normal and there is no point to even test that

[15:20:02] <hayley> Like, make some random places use global allocation, watch if the allocation and write barrier rates change, record, find the places that need to be global, set them up, and repeat.
[15:21:43] <hayley> The problems are that you don't want to spill too much globally, else you're not doing anything thread local, but consistently trapping, copying objects and fixing registers is no fun. We can limit the fixup scale with limited refcounting (I'm not kidding), but it would be better to not do it.

[15:57:27] <lotuseater> oh nice i read the former version of the Mirai 3D modeler (N-Forms) was used to create the graphics for Mario N64
[15:59:25] <lotuseater> okay and much more, like Crash Bandicoot. the engine for it by Naughty Dog (GOOL) was also in Allegro CL
[16:00:37] <pl> lotuseater: the compiler for Naughty Dog's lisp engines was in Allegro CL
[16:00:45] <pl> but Allegro wasn't running on the target machines
[16:00:58] <lotuseater> okay my fault
[16:01:19] <pl> they also used Allegro for a bunch of other tools
[16:01:48] <lotuseater> yeah after that came GOAL for eg the Jak and Daxter series
[16:01:59] <pl> Crash Bandicoot had the engine code mostly in C, with high level behaviours in lisp, the PS2 games had engine written in GOAL
[16:02:10] <lotuseater> both two of my favorite game series :)
[16:02:17] <pl> and GOAL compiler was implemented in ACL, again
[16:02:28] <lotuseater> okay good to know
[16:02:43] <lotuseater> as the PS2 had some more resources ..
[16:03:59] <lotuseater> writing a game engine is anyway a big task
[16:05:08] <lotuseater> and Gollum for Lord of the Rings were modeled by Mirai :)

[17:20:35] <lotuseater> i thought so in 2017 back when i knew nothing about all that, just that the 3 originally games were rewritten from scratch
[17:20:53] <lotuseater> right and now the version 5 must be incredible
[17:21:10] <lotuseater> "I can only imagine Sony's shock when they purchased Naughty Dog a few years back, hoping to be able to leverage some of our technology across other Sony studios, and then realized that there was no way anyone else would be able to use any of our codebase." :D
[17:22:06] <selwyn> yeah lol
[17:23:00] <lotuseater> in Sony's face
[17:24:11] <pl> yet Naughty Dog provided at least some of that over the years
[17:25:25] <lotuseater> it was very impressive not only the game play and storytelling but also what they squeezed out the PS3 resources with Last of Us as one of its last big games in 2013

[18:42:05] <humasect> As they say, "I love games, my favorite it the multiplayer text adventure called Unix."

[19:35:58] <selwyn> saw that
[19:37:04] <selwyn> didnÂ´t realise the bouncer just let him in
[19:37:17] <selwyn> for free
[19:37:49] <ck_> what is a scots rave :o
[19:41:58] <selwyn> the more money and power you have the more shit you get to have for free
[19:42:00] <selwyn> great system
[19:43:28] <selwyn> gnuxie: do you think it is a genuine mid life crisis
[19:43:59] <Gnuxie> dunno 
[19:44:31] <Gnuxie> could be like boris bringing the tea tray out to the reporters kind of deal 
[19:45:30] <selwyn> hm
[19:46:49] <selwyn> he used to be on the telly
[19:46:50] <selwyn> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCyMPBI8Z2Y
[19:49:10] <Gnuxie> ironic 
[19:49:10] <selwyn> sad because he genuinely hates being scottish 
[19:49:24] <selwyn> unlike, say, frankie boyle, who can actually pull off this kind of comedy

[22:51:37] <ck_> so doom is practically the layer above nand-gates
[22:52:11] <lotuseater> in a way
[22:52:24] <ck_> sometimes invisible, but always there in spirit. Like the sculptures inside the rock
[22:53:13] <ck_> (.. insert cacodemon noises here ..)
[22:53:47] <lotuseater> :D
[22:54:22] <lotuseater> happened yet so often that i missed those with a granat
[22:54:31] <lotuseater> (in DOOM Eternal)
[22:54:59] <lotuseater> really evil new classes of enemies
[22:55:38] <ck_> I haven't played any dooms past II
[22:55:47] <lotuseater> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzX09_4hcPc
[22:56:15] <ck_> ah, neat, thanks
[22:57:18] <lotuseater> yes great video :)

[22:57:51] <ck_> these "what should these pixels be if we have 12 times the resolution?" questions are always interesting. Last time I saw that described in detail was for the starcraft hd remake
[22:58:21] <lotuseater> :D
[22:58:50] <ck_> I never asked myself that question before -- "how many VGA displays am I looking at right now?"
[22:58:55] <lotuseater> ok i never played starcraft, maybe because I never had a gaming computer
[22:59:08] <ck_> would've guessed more than 4x3 honestly
[23:00:10] <lotuseater> or when I stood in front of this 80" QLED with 8K TV by Samsung
[23:02:02] <ck_> here's a video I found interesting, maybe it is new to you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGxQzbCuh2M
[23:02:06] <lotuseater> there can be too much of it
[23:02:13] <lotuseater> will look
[23:02:34] <lotuseater> it is
[23:04:55] <lotuseater> the darkest black possible
[23:05:33] <lotuseater> this is still funny: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8
[23:07:24] <lotuseater> "oh, it's bigger on the inside"
[23:08:53] <ck_> complete with stanford bunny and utah teapot
[23:09:06] <lotuseater> so you can even have the penrose stairs in your engine, violating the rules of our universe
[23:20:40] <ck_> what was the student game that portal got the idea from called again?
[23:21:04] <ck_> ah, "Narbacular Drop"
