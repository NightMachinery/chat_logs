[00:00:42] <cbreak> ale: if you have a normal git repo, you can look at them with git branch -r
[00:01:17] <ale> well, in my world i fetch from upstream and push to origin ... both being remotes... but in the middle i have a local repo.
[00:02:24] <ale> just to frame a bit my question: the commands i've shown correctly get the right branch and correctly sets up the git remote...
[00:02:40] <ale> ... the issue is that it also creates branches for refs that i don't know where they are coming from.
[00:03:03] <ale> and spends hours fetching the files for each single ref.
[00:03:18] <cbreak> In my experience, simply using git svn clone works
[00:03:29] <cbreak> if that doesn't for you, I'd recommend finding out why not
[00:03:45] <ale> ok, i guess i'll try to ask in the git irc channel...

[00:04:48] <cbreak> I'm mostly interested in the URL
[00:04:49] <ale> git fetch
[00:05:05] <ale> no url, since the url is already set in the git config.
[00:05:14] <ale> it's just `git svn fetch`
[00:05:17] <cbreak> that's why I recommend you use git clone
[00:05:24] <cbreak> it will properly set up the config for you
[00:10:20] <cbreak> ale: just tested it, git svn clone svn://scribus.net/branches/Version15x seems to work.

[14:49:54] <cousteau> Is there a way to know to which branch a commit was committed?  Git normally doesn't use this info since conceptually commits can belong to multiple branches, but I think it could help display more meaningful graphs
[14:51:07] <cousteau> I suspect git log may have this info, but I don't know if this only works locally or if it would also work for info received from a remote (I don't think the git log is fetched, is it?)

[21:22:42] <Hiruma> My current intention is to have a template project, which other projects fork from (basic setup, build tools, ...). This enables an imho cleaner way to reflect decisions for a settings change affecting multiple projects.
[21:22:46] <Hiruma> One annoying detail is however, that this causes a very long line in the git graph of the forks, ending where the last template change was merged. I am considering rebasing the template changes for each project, but as this means rebasing commits which may/will later get commits that base on them added, this is sketchy.
[21:22:53] <Hiruma> Although git iirc does understand rebases where patch-id of some commits is identical, any odd detail could break this, and cause issues.
[21:22:57] <Hiruma> Should i just accept the long git graph line, do it as a rebase anyways, or what would you suggest here?

[22:08:02] <Hiruma> interesting approach instead of forking, but the template project includes a lot of non-git-related files, e.g. settings for package-manager/compiler/linter/etc. Also, the primary goal is to be able to update some of these later, and cleanly apply those changes to all related projects (the group using those explicit settings). So far, i lean more towards just accepting the line in git-graph, as a normal merge appears
[22:08:02] <Hiruma> to be the cleanest otherwise.

[22:18:47] <Hiruma> To make this a bit less abstract, some examples of what the current template has: yarn version/settings/plugins (e.g. private registry URL setup), public TLS CA certificate for said registry, package.json setup with common packages, e.g. eslint and settings, base typescript config, etc. I began by just copying the template, when beginning a new project, but when i make a change (e.g. the certificate expires
[22:18:47] <Hiruma> eventually), i'd prefer making the change in the template, and merging it over to all projects.
[22:20:48] <ramblebamble> Hiruma, considered making it a sub-module?
[22:21:15] <ikke> that would limit the template file to a single subdirectory
[22:22:17] <ramblebamble> ah ok sorry there is some more conversation I havn't gotten hold of, but a template is just that isn't it s.th. other things are based upon, so how many folders does it need to relate to?

[22:25:58] <Hiruma> To re-iterate, my original idea was forking from the template. The main annoyance i have is, that if i do this, the likely scenario are lots of commits, then after months a single template update merged, which results in a line in git graph all the way back from the first commit up to the current. That seems ugly, to always have that line there.

[22:27:45] <ramblebamble> Hiruma, where is this template used in, because to me it looks like it could be to solve a dependency problem with git, which might be better suited for package-managers

[22:28:50] <ikke> either live with the merge commits, deal with rebasing all the time, or find another non-git approach
[22:29:11] <Hiruma> I expect so, but sadly i wasn't good enough at finding google searches yielding articles about the topic
[22:29:33] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[22:30:07] <Hiruma> the template has e.g. settings for the used package-manager (among others), so it's sadly hard to use packages (which are already used for e.g. linter settings)

[22:31:24] <ramblebamble> packet manager definitely packet manager, look at composer and yarn/npm or cargo etc. how they bootstrap projects
[22:31:32] <ikke> I would probably create some script which deploys the boiler plate
[22:31:50] <Hiruma> i used it so far without git, and just copied it in, but considered changing the setup, so i could distribute changes to the template to all projects in a more clean way

[22:44:17] <Hiruma> Thanks for all the input :) I'll consider if there is a proper way to do this with a package (first issue i could think of would be files that don't have a well-rounded functionality for "extension", which e.g. tsconfig/yarnrc have, but maybe not all). If not, i'll just accept the long git-graph line, and do forks and merges. My primary goal with these questions is often "fishing for things i overlooked". Before
[22:44:17] <Hiruma> doing something i think is good, i rather check what's commonly done first :)
