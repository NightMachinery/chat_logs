[01:29:45] <twkm> i prefer having a sleep.
[01:30:15] <greycat> there's also "until".
[01:30:24] <twkm> a'la, while sleep 1; do ...; done or while sleep 1 && otherstuff; do ...; done.
[01:33:37] <neshpion> actually `while :; do` turned out to be the key because i have one step to do before each `thing && break` whose return code i print on failure
[01:38:53] <twkm> ewww.
[01:39:15] <twkm> again, i'd usually have a sleep instead of :, or at least a counter.
[01:39:27] <greycat> maybe they've got a sleep at the bottom of the loop body

[01:45:58] <Liblx> Hello, am I right that the extension for bash files is still '.sh' (shell)? And it's only about '#!/bin/bash'?
[01:46:07] <greycat> !.sh
[01:46:07] <greybot> Don't use extensions for your scripts. Scripts define new commands that you can run, and commands are generally not given extensions. Do you run ls.elf? Also: bash scripts are *not* sh scripts (so don't use .sh) and the extension will only cause dependencies headaches if the script gets rewritten in another language.

[01:54:02] <Liblx> And one more question: I think I can remember that 'echo "Today: `date`"' is no more the right way to code it? Or I am wrong. Thanks.
[01:54:39] <Liblx> If yes, I got a link but I cannot find it anymore in my bookmarks.
[01:54:42] <phy1729> !`
[01:54:42] <greybot> The backquote (`) is used in the old-style command substitution, e.g. foo=`command`. The foo=$(command) syntax is recommended instead. Backslash handling inside $() is less surprising, and $() is easier to nest. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082
[01:54:46] <phy1729> !echo
[01:54:46] <greybot> echo outputs a string. echo has many portability problems, and should never be used with option flags. Consider printf instead: printf 'name: %s\n' "$name". http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/commands/builtin/echo | http://cfajohnson.com/shell/cus-faq.html#Q0b | http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/echo+printf
[01:54:46] <greycat> backticks are deprecated.  if you really want the command substitution, prefer the $() syntax.  echo "Today: $(date)"

[01:55:26] <greycat> Otherwise, if you don't care about sh (or bash 3.2) compatibility, you can use:  printf 'Today: %(%Y-%m-%d)T\n' -1

[06:23:56] <rs_> is there something wrong with this: `xargs --delimiter='\n' --replace=DIRECTORY printf "%s\n" "DIRECTORY" <dirs.txt`, assuming dirs.txt contains a list of directories? It is always suspicious when xargs is used without -0.

[06:31:53] <e36freak> rs_: directory names can technically contain newlines, which would be the issue there

[06:35:40] <rs_> e36freak: yeah, please ignore that potential issue with newlines and also its actual purpose. I'm only interested in edge cases that could break xargs with --delimiter for this use-case 
[06:36:34] *** Quits: __jmcantrell__ (~weechat@user/jmcantrell) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)

[06:37:58] <e36freak> although i'd just use a while read loop for that, not xargs
[06:38:12] <e36freak> you don't really gain anything using xargs with --replace, it's still only running a command once per filename
[06:40:10] <rs_> is that the only edge case? I learned from BashPitfalls that xargs is utterly broken and should only be used with null characters as delimiters.

[06:56:17] <rs_> Sure. As I said, the actual purpose in this case is irrelevant, but since I wasn't able to see what's wrong with xargs in this case, I thought I should ask here. In fact, it behaves okay using the input described in http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls?highlight=%28xargs%29#Using_xargs_without_-0 
[06:59:35] <rs_> From the same page: "If you use xargs without -0 put a comment in your code explaining why that is safe in your particular situation.". It implies that xargs can be used safely in some cases.
[07:00:00] <e36freak> it can, yes
[07:00:16] <e36freak> just like eval can. but it can be difficult and you have to know it

[07:11:44] <rs_> absolutely, but maybe this combination of --delimiter + --replace should be considered in http://mywiki.wooledge.org (if it is generally safe). I feel I developed an unfair bias against xargs. Having said that, that replacement looks good but looks like a bug waiting to happen.

[11:47:21] <geirha> but yes, when you assign the python_script variable, the $LAST_WORD you inject into the python code is unset initially
[11:47:53] <dre> should I move it down to line 48 ? \
[11:48:09] <geirha> no, you should stop doing code injection at all
[11:48:13] <dre> lol
[11:48:23] <geirha> pass it on to python via env or argv
[11:49:03] <dre> okie, I'll work on it
[11:49:29] <dre> you're right because it's not totally working as well as I'd hope anyway,
[11:49:45] <geirha> e.g. in your function   local -x LAST_WORD=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]};   then the following python -c "$python_script" can access the value via os.environ["LAST_WORD"]
[11:49:45] <dre> well you're right objectively but I will work on it because it's not totally working ...  ** 
[11:50:06] <dre> oh neat
[11:50:15] <dre> makes sense 
[11:50:50] <geirha> your injection also happens at the wrong time. Surely you wanted it to happen during completion, but instead it's only done when you source the script

[11:51:10] <dre> oh right

[11:51:36] <geirha> yes
[11:52:43] <dre> neat, makes sense. I'm not really in the headspace for the bash scripting i was just trying to smash something out while needing it at work 
[11:52:55] <geirha> Also, you should lowercase TEST_FIXTURE and make it local too
[11:53:39] <dre> yeah good advice, there's something in the topic about bash script styling isn't there? 
[11:54:00] <geirha> sadly no, we lack a decent style guide

[11:55:29] <dre> one quick question is that I'm using the options "-o bashdefault -o default -F for things like file tab complete

[19:59:30] <rtn0> ...(Cuz if i find a *huge* playlist, it will be unacceptably time-consuming to copypasta all those times by hand, and then sum them in bc).
[19:59:35] <rtn0> thx in advance :)
[19:59:57] <drew`> is there a single command I could use to set variables equal to the audio and video sizes? or should I just set the output of that to a variable and then set a variable equal to sed's on that string?
