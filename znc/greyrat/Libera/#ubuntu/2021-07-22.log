[01:13:00] <webchat89> The ramdisk is not getting initialised for sure and the TPM hint makes sense, the missing graphic output is no issue of the kernel itself. I am just bugged by thinking that I do not want to deactivate TPM permantly! Even if that workaround works, I simply can not do this to this working LTS machine as a "semi-permanent" solution. There has to be
[01:13:00] <webchat89> smth else. Smth has to be wrong with the TPM hashes, and there got to be a way to recalculate them/grant new keys or whatever the process of TPM is.
[01:13:01] <shibboleth> webchat89, imagine working support and the caller just refuses to go through the troubleshooting steps because he doesn't understand why you asking them to do it. that's you right now

[01:43:15] <shibboleth> not actually what it says in the old testament, but, eh... more family friendly :)
[01:43:33] <webchat89> shibboleth well that I think is the issue :)  you think you were helping me, but the words you wrote couldnt explain at all that you are onto some diagnostics. You just told me to deactivate TPM, and when I asked why I should deactiavte it you (by not knowing any better?) told me I dont deactivate it with that command. Which isnt true. And I simpy
[01:43:33] <webchat89> simply can not test around on this live server an entire company relies on! And for sure you wouldnt deactivate TPM if thats the only guarantee there is no evil maid attack on the LUKS (I mentioned LUKS, havent I ?). So I have the same issue as you do: Wrapping my head around the proposed solution OR diagnostics! I updated GRUB now, and if that
[01:43:34] <webchat89> will work out we have a solution that was without security risks of testing around a secured boot. So yeah, exp. hard "to wrap around, exp. for a linux users suggestion" that there was no reply for just my question of proceeding with the next step ;o)

[09:47:40] <glestrade> hmm so I think I had used vnc4server
[09:47:53] <glestrade> and you’re saying that they’re both trying to talk to a different display
[09:48:17] <glestrade> that is, I used vnc4server last week
[09:48:41] <alkisg> It's possible that one of these is trying to set up multiple sessions, and it's messing your DISPLAY
[09:48:59] <alkisg> So maybe all you need to do is uninstall one of them, e.g. tigervncserver or something
[09:49:27] <glestrade> isn’t display an env variable
[09:49:36] <glestrade> so if I reset it then...

[09:50:34] <glestrade> hmm yeah
[09:50:43] <alkisg> I.e. you just won't be able to run graphics programs after that; you won't uninstall the server
[09:51:10] <glestrade> no I get that
[09:51:41] <LuckyMan> alkisg, the big question is: what has changed in 21.04 gdm (because it works fine with 20.04)

[09:52:57] <glestrade> well let’s see what happens when I get rid of the other two vnc server programs
[09:53:05] <glestrade> I’m on 18.04 if that’s important
[09:53:39] <alkisg> LuckyMan: probably the kernel
[09:54:04] <alkisg> I.e. if you install 20.04 and then install the -hwe-edge kernel (5.11), it might happen there too

[09:56:55] <glestrade> alkisg: I’m about to look this up - does vnc4server have a default socket it uses
[09:57:04] <glestrade> it seems to believe that it’s already in use
[09:57:18] <glestrade> I’m curious so I’d like to do this before uninstalling it and tiger
[09:57:43] <alkisg> glestrade: vnc servers connect to xorg with normal function calls, which use display, which go to /tmp/.X* sockets. There's no point at all in troubleshooting that.

[15:01:31] *** Quits: arif-ali (~arif-ali@canonical/arif-ali) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[15:01:39] <Bardon> Even after the server has started, the network is obviously working since I'm logged in through ssh but `sudo systemctl start systemd-networkd-wait-online.service` fails
[15:01:51] <Bardon> "Job for systemd-networkd-wait-online.service failed because the control process exited with error code."
[15:03:30] <cbreak> Bardon: why did you enable that?
[15:03:45] <cbreak> it's disabled on my system, and apparently it's disabled by default
[15:03:51] <Bardon> cbreak: Did I? I don't remember doing it but it's possible
[15:04:00] <Bardon> I'll just disble it then :)
[15:04:28] <Bardon> I'm pretty sure I didn't touch it though. I installed my OS a few days ago and haven't touched many things
[15:04:29] <cbreak> I have a 21.04 install
[15:04:38] <Bardon> It's ubuntu server 20.04 LTS
[15:04:40] <cbreak> upgraded from 20.10, desktop
[15:04:46] <Bardon> fresh install here
[15:04:49] <cbreak> maybe it's enabled on servers? :/
[15:05:08] <Bardon> which would make sense because not having network access is a big concern
[15:05:15] <Bardon> on servers
[15:05:48] <cbreak> wonder if it checks for network connectivity, or _internet_ connectivity
[15:06:19] <cbreak> heh, man systemd-networkd-wait-online works
[15:06:49] <Bardon> Ah!
[15:06:51] <cbreak> By default, it will wait for all links it is aware of and which are managed by systemd-networkd.service(8) to be fully configured or failed, and for at least one link to be online
[15:07:00] <cbreak> (that's C&P)
[15:07:00] <Bardon> "it will wait for all links it is aware of". There are 7 ports on my server but I just use one
[15:07:03] <Bardon> ethernet ports
[15:07:06] <cbreak> maybe you have links that aren't configured?

[16:58:43] <webchat91> Since Kernel 5.9.0-59.63 and further on, my GRUB after trying to initalise the RAMDisk is only blank. I opened a ticket, https://askubuntu.com/questions/1348180/black-screen-on-boot-on-hp-probook-450-g6-with-5-8-0-59-66-reason-why-delete no reply, I went to this IRC yesterday and the advise was to Grub - Command Line - rmmod tpm to try if TPM is
[16:58:44] <webchat91> causing the issue. Ive tried the method, and tried updating grub, but the screen stays blank. I am forced to use Kernel 5.8.0-55 and I am quite frustrated with some LTS 20.04 this can happen! Other users report the same issue, so I am desperate for a solution and desperate that since 4 weeks no one was able to help within the ticket. Any
[16:58:44] <webchat91> recommandations?

[17:17:15] <cart_man> ok so what does the -f do?
[17:17:30] <Duality> selects which indexes form the cut you want
[17:18:11] <Duality> or rather which parts
[17:20:45] <Duality> so in this case cut command would chop up "PU %MEM 0.1% 0.1%" into four parts and -f would select the parts in this case the last two being third and fourth element :)
[17:21:34] <Duality> with -d you can select where to make the cut and since there is a space inbetween the words that is where i cut it
[17:21:50] <Duality> with " " to select for space

[19:06:20] <BT643> Feels like a dumb question, but I've been using Ubuntu 20.04 (with an encrypted drive), and today I wanted to reinstall. I put a 20.04 installtion on a USB stick and booted from it. Installed a fresh version of Ubuntu 20.04 on the drive (full erase and reinstall) but when I went to boot the encryption password wouldn't work. I booted from the Live
[19:06:21] <BT643> USB again and could access my drive using the password. Rebooted again leaving the USB drive in and was able to get into the main OS (non-live). Removed the USB and rebooted again and it complained again: "cryptsetup: ERROR: sda3_crypt: cryptsetup failed, bad password or options?". Seems I've somehow got the encryption key on the media I used to
[19:06:21] <BT643> install?

[22:10:22] <TJ-> webchat23: in which case your next suspect is the initrd.img files created for the newer (failing) kernel versions. It is possible that the older kernel that works does so since its companion initrd.img hasn't been updated (thankfully1) and therefore does not contain some change that has broken things in the later initrd.imgs
[22:11:12] <ioria> webchat23, have you tried to boot in Recovery mode ?
[22:13:15] <TJ-> webchat23: you can do some basic testing of one of the failing versions by editing the "linux ..." command line in GRUB when starting, removing "quiet splash" and adding "debug break=premount" and pressing Ctrl+X to boot with that change. if it works you'll be dropped to a busybox shell in the initrd.img before the LUKS unlock stage and can investigate
[22:18:47] <webchat23> ioria i am not too sure right now, I think I tried it in the beginning but that issue is since a month so Im not too sure. Could perform it later with the restart. TJ- debug break command is so he stops on error? I surely can start without splash screen and see at which module he fails. But I wouldnt know what I should do in some shell command
[22:18:48] <webchat23> wise. Sounds also like some issue a LTS version shouldnt suffer :( quite desperating, exp. like you can see in my askubuntu ticket that I fear any update may remove the last working kernel as the system seems not to work with flagging kernels as "rc" or "ii" as my tries to remove the newer kernels wasnt successful either.

[23:01:37] <tomreyn> webchat23: i may not have followed the full story, but did oyu not say you're able to boot using an older kernel image? or did you delete those that worked fine?

[23:02:58] <lotuspsychje> tomreyn: his askubuntu thread here https://askubuntu.com/questions/1348180/black-screen-on-boot-with-5-8-0-59-66-reason-why-delete-kernel
[23:03:50] <tomreyn> lotuspsychje: thanks, i read this one. and wondered whether this is the same issue reported at https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/71003 and at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/3569
[23:03:51] <ubottu> Issue 3569 in drm/intel "Laptop display screen switches off at boot" [Opened]
[23:05:01] <tomreyn> if an older kernel is bootable, journalctl -b -1    should provide logs from last but one boot (which could be one that failed with a black screen)

[23:08:14] <tomreyn> another thing to try would be to disable "secure boot" in bios, to boot with "dis_ucode_ldr" initrd (grub "kernel" line) option, and to change the orde rin which graphics chipsets (integrated (intel), dedicated (nvidia)) are initialized. or disabling the dedicated altogether (just to see whether it helps), if this is possible.

[23:18:39] <webchat23> tomreyn thanks for the hint the logs. I will try to perform a new kernel boot and than the old, working kernel again and check the logs. Anyways: Secure boot was tried to mitgate with the rmmod tpm, and the machine in question only has an integraged GPU and no dedicated one, so altering the graphic chipset manually is not necessary for
[23:18:40] <webchat23> troubleshooting.

[23:25:06] <tomreyn> webchat23: playing with (disabling, where possible) power saving options for i915 *might* help, too, depending on where it fails. but, first of all, let's see whether you get any logs at all on a failed boot, and if so, which,
[23:26:12] <webchat23> tomreyn Im not one of the users who suffers issues when coming from a sleeping machine - I suffer the issue with a cold boot.

[23:43:08] <webchat23> lotuspsychje as I do not run a dedicated graphic card I wouldnt compare this case to me. The other links to archlinux cases with Kernel 5.11 and 5.12, but with the proper HP board and Intel i915 iGPU sounds narrowing the problem more precise - but sure, maybe its the same underlying reason with that HP board of your suggested ticket aswell.
