[01:45:24] <fearnothing> hey folks, trying to understand how I can adapt an existing process to work in docker. I have a web app that's calling a function when a user requests something. That function fires up an external process, gets some data, then when the data is ready it calls a websocket function to notify the user's browser to fetch the data
[01:46:42] *** Joins: jonifen (~jonifen@user/jonifen)
[01:47:47] *** Quits: jonifen (~jonifen@user/jonifen) (Client Quit)
[01:48:44] <fearnothing> that part about running another process would be sensible to do in a separate container to the web app, but what I'm not sure of is how to pass data between the web app and the other container. I know I -can- use any networking protocol to talk between them, but I don't know how to decide what makes sense to use for those requirements.
[01:49:23] *** Joins: jonifen (~jonifen@user/jonifen)
[01:49:24] <tabakhase> network, or even unix-sockets in a volume yea
[01:50:19] <tabakhase> "start another" gets a little itchy, giving the starter basically root on your host - cerntainly its done too, just not all that clean  (sometimes its done by adding another man in the middle)
[01:53:56] <fearnothing> ok, let me make it more specific because maybe that will help point at a sensible choice. This project uses puppeteer/chromium to fetch a page and do some analysis of it when the user requests via my app's UI. So, they feed in a URL, nodejs then has an async function that spins up chromium, reads the results and inserts into db, and the callback function sends a websocket message to the user's 
[01:53:56] <fearnothing> browser to say data's ready, fetch it

[01:55:29] <fearnothing> so I want to split the web UI and the bit that runs chromium into separate containers, but that then means I don't have a way of directly executing chromium, or of directly triggering that websocket callback. I need to decide on a way of doing that
[01:56:34] *** Quits: goose (goose@bucket.goose.ws) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[01:56:50] <fearnothing> I don't necessarily need my web UI to -create- the new container instance with puppeteer, I could have it already running and just kick off the process with a network request of some kind
[01:57:01] <fearnothing> but... what kind? that's the question.
[01:57:29] <fearnothing> I could certainly implement them all as HTTP APIs, that wouldn't be too hard. I just don't know if I -should-.
[01:59:30] <fearnothing> I'm new to all of this and HTTP APIs are something I'm used to, nodejs web apps are my hammer so everything looks like a HTTP-shaped nail :P

[02:25:39] <fearnothing> currently I have: (web UI user) -> (nodejs web app). when the user sends a URL to test, nodejs uses puppeteer to launch Chromium, read the data and insert into DB, all within the nodejs app
[02:26:50] <fearnothing> the new version will be (web UI user) -> (nodejs web app), then (nodejs web app) -> (container running puppeteer/chromium), and finally (puppeteer/chromium container) -> (nodejs web app)
[02:27:20] <fearnothing> if that last stage is implemented with a HTTP endpoint in the nodejs web app, that means it's exposed to teh web UI user too
[02:28:23] <fearnothing> and consequently needs some way of ensuring a malicious user can't abuse it to insert bogus data, or whatever else

[15:25:26] <__that__> Hi all
[15:30:09] <__that__> We have a docker container running a snapshot of our database which is sql server. The scripts that create the database runs normally only once as such script creates a app_initliaised file in the docker container /tmp. So any time you want to add a new field you ought to remove that file from the container.
[15:32:09] <__that__> So I added field x and remove from tmp folder the app_initialised file. And that worked well. However I change the same alter to add another field Y and removed again the app_initiliased file so that the database scripts could run afresh. I can now see the two fields. X and Y but I was expecting to see only Y
[15:33:03] <__that__> The reason being that the database was being created afresh. How could this happen please?

[15:50:31] <jochum> __that__: also ANYTHING not in a bindmount/volume is not safe.
[15:50:38] <__that__> jockhum, no I didn't. I remove the /tmp folder because the script for the database creation look at it in order to know if the script should run again: https://dpaste.com/2BVHW4UUY.
[15:51:02] <jochum> have to work
[15:51:22] <__that__> I added a field X to a table and removed the tmp/app_initiliased from so that the create db scripts could run again and they did.
[15:52:03] <__that__> Then I changed my mind and I don't want field X anymore. I want field Y. I repeated the same operation and now I have X and Y
[15:52:10] <__that__> I just want Y
[15:53:14] <__that__> as I assumed that the database was created from the scratch again. How on earth all those scripts that ran again did not fail if the database was still on the container
[15:54:14] <__that__> That doesn't happen on CI because the host is being created from the scratch all the time
[15:55:10] <__that__> so do I need to run docker-compose rm -f -s -v <service> and build and up again?

[18:29:25] <ada_> the environment: key does the same thing as env_file: - it sets the value of environment variables

[18:33:27] <iffraff> hmmm, that could work.
[18:33:29] <tabakhase> iffraff none of that is for "building images" - and "outside the container" who you talkn about?

My understanding is that when you run docker up it loads those .env variables, uses them to build the containers but does not add them to the os.

[23:04:42] <Ballerburg9005> I am doing a FROM myname/myimage in a second docker file, but it doesn't pull an updated version of this image it is missing new packages I included later. I already did buildx cache purge, but it changes nothing. It looks to me like it has cached the old Dockerfile of myname/myimage and it builds the image from scratch (not sure though, not always the same).
[23:05:16] <Ballerburg9005> is there a way to make sure "FROM myname/myimage" really uses the newest version from dockerhub?
[23:05:32] <tabakhase> --pull?

[23:06:10] <Ballerburg9005> if I purge the cache though, how does it even have the old version?
[23:06:33] <tabakhase> images are technically separate from build-cache
[23:06:48] <tabakhase> (especially with buildx)
[23:07:39] <Ballerburg9005> --pull doesn't work
[23:08:54] <Ballerburg9005> --pull --no-cache has no effect

[23:11:36] <Ballerburg9005> tabakhase: the output shows no download and immediately executes commands. I tested the base image it has bash, I tested the new image it has no bash.
[23:12:09] <Ballerburg9005> since it didn't download anything new, it must result in the same faulty image
[23:13:00] <Ballerburg9005> bash was one of the packages not included initially, but later

[23:39:04] <Activ8> that's for external dns resolutions not internal.  But depends on your setup you can use cloudflare sure.  You may require something like a proxy first like nginx proxy manager.  Depends what services you are hosting and what you want it all to do.
[23:39:34] <alexeightsix> i just want all requests inside my docker container to go through cloudflare's dns
[23:39:48] <alexeightsix> my php docker is defined in a docker-compose.yml file
[23:39:49] <akik> alexeightsix: you can bind mount the resolv.conf from the host

[23:47:42] <alexeightsix> i dont want to overcomplicate things, i may just set the DNS on the host itself
[23:47:57] <ada_> set the dns on the host.
[23:47:59] <ada_> it's the simplest way
[23:48:18] <ada_> also, if you want to customize the DNS servers ona container, you can do that
[23:48:21] <alexeightsix> yeah will have to do that, just wanted to see if it was possible to abstract it to docker for reusability 
[23:48:26] <ada_> but changing /etc/resolv in the container isn't the way
[23:49:34] <Activ8> I thought you said the other hosts can't see the other containers when you set cloudflare up on the container instead of the isp?
[23:49:52] <ada_> if you're using user defined networks, then when you create the network you can specify DNS servers to be used;  docker will still put 127.0.0.11 in the container resolv.conf file, but docker intercepts all DNS request made from the container and resolves container hostnames, but if it's not a container hostname then it sends it to your upstream nameservers from the host /etc/resolv.conf or the
[23:49:53] <ada_> --dns flag
[23:50:25] <ada_> Activ8: yeah if you were to replace the 127.0.0.11 address, then docker wouldn't intercept the requests and wouldn't be able to resolve container names
