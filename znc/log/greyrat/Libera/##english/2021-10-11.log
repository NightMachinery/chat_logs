[00:39:23] <GuiToris> hello, can you help me pronounce the name 'Blount'? does it rhyme with 'blunt' or 'font' or even 'amount'
[00:39:26] <GuiToris> I have no clue
[00:39:35] <dTal> ..what
[00:39:51] <dTal> Whatever that is, I'm pretty confident it's not English.
[00:40:32] <GuiToris> dTal, you're not talking to me, are you?
[00:41:14] <dTal> I am.
[00:41:26] <GuiToris> what makes a word English?
[00:41:32] <GuiToris> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blount,_Georgia
[00:41:42] <GuiToris> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blount,_West_Virginia
[00:41:43] <dTal> I'd quote Taxi Driver, but the mods in here are probably all anal about swearing.
[00:42:09] <dTal> Oh, it's a placename.
[00:42:20] <GuiToris> proper name
[00:42:20] <dTal> Honestly, no way to know without listening to a local say it.
[00:42:37] <dTal> The Georgia one and the West Virginia one might even be different.
[00:42:51] <GuiToris> :/
[00:43:06] <GuiToris> got it
[00:43:07] <GuiToris> thanks
[00:43:20] <GuiToris> if anyone heard this name before, let me know it :)
[00:44:27] <dTal> gimme a sec
[00:45:03] <dTal> It's "blunt" apparently
[00:45:35] <GuiToris> which one did you look up?
[00:45:43] <GuiToris> and how could have looked it up?
[00:45:56] <GuiToris> I'd like to know the method so the next time I shouldn't bother you
[00:46:08] <dTal> On the basis that the Georgia town was named after a dude, so Blount is a surname, and there's a writer from Georgia name "Roy Blount" and his surname is pronounced "blunt" according to the opening speaker here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=War4BPKtk3M
[00:48:15] <dTal> Why are you interested in tiny unincorporated American towns named Blount? Odd category
[00:50:52] <GuiToris> I'm not interested in them at all, my nephew is playing Gobliiins 3 where the character is called 'Blount' and I just didn't know what to tell my nephew
[00:53:16] <dTal> Your commitment to accurate pronunciation is admirable and would ironically not likely be shared by a native speaker of English
[00:53:55] <dTal> speaking personally, I would have not looked it up and just said it rhyming with "amount" :p
[00:54:13] <dTal> as I suspect would anyone who didn't know someone with that surname
[00:55:05] <GuiToris> is this also 'blunt'? https://youtu.be/hSszixvo7d8?t=210  I can't always recognize the 'uh' sound, as a matter of fact I mix them up with oh
[00:58:34] <dTal> Sounds like "blunt" to me
[00:59:29] <GuiToris> thank you, last question what does '...the mods in here are probably all anal about swearing' mean?
[00:59:41] <GuiToris> google translate gave it up

[01:10:26] <twb> FTR I'm an op in ##english, and I have no problem talking ABOUT swear words (use/mention distinction), and I have no problem talking WITH swear words, if used judiciously.
[01:11:00] <GuiToris> !ud ftr
[01:11:01] <twb> For example, "what does 'fuck' mean?" and "I fucking hate the Oxford comma" are both perfectly fine.

[01:11:49] <LjL> a few days ago in a channel that will go unnamed, someone who was an op rather gratuitously used the term "MILF", then someone else expanded the acronym (annoyingly, but kind of inevitably in a big channel i'd say), and the op went "mind your language".

[01:11:53] <tinsoldier> hypocrisy — Noun: 1. The contrivance of a false appearance of virtue or goodness, while concealing real character or inclinations, especially with respect to religious and moral beliefs; hence in general sense, dissimulation, pretence, sham., 2.

[01:12:30] <GuiToris> thanks for helping!
[01:12:47] <twb> LjL: usually when it happens I switch to "berk" because Americans do not know it is rhyming slang for "cunt"
[01:13:09] <twb> (Americans are usually the ones who complain about swearing; they seem to not understand use/mention)
[01:13:55] <LjL> yeah... i could bring up a particular word wrt that, but i won't
[01:14:45] <twb> I should not, however, that *using* ad hominem and slurs are not acceptable.
[01:15:05] <twb> *is not acceptable
[01:15:58] <twb> LjL: yeah "the n word" is an exception to my usual use/mention heuristic because Americans have *really* strong feelings about that, and it's not a hill I want to die on
[01:16:14] <LjL> i'm more interested in your mistake of saying "are not acceptable"
[01:16:25] <LjL> https://www.thoughtco.com/proximity-agreement-grammar-1691697
[01:16:42] <twb> LjL: it was due to poor editing
[01:17:11] <twb> I had "for example ... and ... are not acceptable" in there earlier
[01:17:21] <LjL> okay
[01:17:24] <twb> ...I think
[01:18:03] <LjL> still even if you'd done it without changing what you were going to write in the process, it's a "mistake" with a name, and those tend to be interesting ones
[01:18:42] <LjL> although i think there's a wikipedia page on it that's a bit less invasive than the site i linked, but it uses a different term i guess since i'm not seeing it

[13:28:20] <cousteau> I meant the "whomst" 
[13:30:23] <cousteau> OK so "whom" is considered correct and apt for a formal conversation, and not necessarily pedantic.  Maybe you wouldn't use it in a casual conversation though. 
[13:30:58] * cousteau wasn't unsure if it was OK to use it in a chat or if that'd make me look like an idiot
[13:33:15] <cousteau> I have to say I've never learned "whom" in any English (as a foreign language) class I've ever had.  I learned it from the internet...

[13:40:34] <cousteau> Another one: does "may not" mean it's not required, or that it's forbidden?  I'm reading documentation that uses the terms may99,99 and may not99,99 in italics 
[13:41:31] <cousteau> I assumed they were "standard" phrases as described in RFC2119, but "may not" is not listed there 
[13:43:01] <cousteau> So I think that whoever wrote that saw a similar use of may99,99 and must not99,99 in another document (referencing RFC2119) and used that style because it looked professional, unaware that it had a further meaning

[13:59:31] <huf> cousteau: nah
[13:59:39] <huf> it's perfectly clear
[13:59:45] <huf> you cannot omit those parameters
[14:00:09] <cousteau> I read it as "may or may not be omitted" 
[14:00:23] <huf> then you're wrong
[14:00:51] <porphyry> is there anybody in there?
[14:00:55] <cousteau> Also, if they're implicitly referencing RFC2119, "may99,99" means optional 
[14:01:17] <cousteau> porphyry: we can read you :) 
[14:01:38] <porphyry> cousteau: thanks.
[14:01:45] <huf> cousteau: so?
[14:04:37] <huf> cousteau: it's not a very good phrasing but I think my reading is the normal one
[14:04:39] <cousteau> huf: so it would mean that you can omit them, but you don't have to 
[14:05:21] <cousteau> Yes, it makes sense to me, but writing it in italics drives me to confusion, as if it were a phrase with a special meaning 
[14:05:54] <cousteau> In other parts of the document they seem to use it meaning "not necessarily" 
[14:07:14] <cousteau> "E.g. if the clock() functions is a compiler stub, it may not be used." 
[14:08:02] <cousteau> Does that also mean "must not", or in that case it could mean "it is possible that it is not used"?

[14:12:13] <cousteau> Another one clearly means "must not" from context - "`check` - test MD5 of sources that may not be modified" (you're not allowed to touch those files, and an MD5 checksum is taken to ensure that you didn't) 
[14:12:53] <porphyry> cousteau: i think it means `can not` or `must not` depending on context.
[14:15:54] *** Joins: totenkoph (~scythe@user/totenkoph)
[14:16:37] <cousteau> I guess I might contact the developers and suggest they change the "may not"s to either "must not" or "might not", and maybe mention RFC2119, which seems to be commonly used in this type of requirement document

[14:20:58] <ychaouche> hello ##english, I need some help with writing my résumé, I'd like to say that I was in charge of "travaux pratiques" (french), I don't know if "practical works" exist in english ? 
[14:21:27] <porphyry> ychaouche: what do you mean?
[14:21:33] <blkshp> English* and can you define what it means because it may work with an additional word.
[14:22:13] <cousteau> Yes, some context may help to know what you mean 
[14:22:43] <ychaouche> basically, when I was at university, you had two or three types of learning : the lecture, where the professor says the lesson, then you had labs, where it's usually a tutor that helps you do some practical examples, called "TP" in french (travaux pratiques), and you also have "TD" (travaux dirigés), where it's also a professor, not a tutor, but instead of giving a lecture you just do exercises.
[14:23:22] <porphyry> ychaouche: `Practicals` sounds right

[14:23:46] <blkshp> OK, so what's the full sentence that you want to use it in in English?
[14:23:53] <ychaouche> "in charge of practicals for the C language" does it sound right ? 
[14:24:06] <porphyry> ychaouche: or `Lab Assignments`
[14:24:10] <ychaouche> in work experience
[14:24:30] <porphyry> ychaouche: in charge of tutoring students in C programming in Computer Laboratory
[14:24:33] <blkshp> In charge of the practical working assignments for the C language.
[14:25:12] <ychaouche> porphyry: just to confirm, are you US english speaker, UK or AU ? 
[14:25:25] <ychaouche> those are the 3 main spoken variants right ? 
[14:25:38] <porphyry> ychaouche: certainnly not.
[14:25:39] <ychaouche> (I don't know if canadians use special english, I don't think so, do they ?)
[14:25:53] <porphyry> ychaouche: english variants don't differ as much.
[14:25:53] <blkshp> The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. England division :D
[14:25:54] <cousteau> "lab practice" maybe?  (not a native speaker myself) 
[14:26:17] <blkshp> (you want to quit putting that space before punctuation marks too :))
[14:26:29] <cousteau> porphyry: I'd say US and UK vary in some regards 
[14:26:31] <ychaouche> that's hard for a french speaker
[14:26:35] <ychaouche> but thanks for the heads up
[14:26:39] <blkshp> I know! :D
[14:26:41] <porphyry> cousteau: compared to what?
[14:28:00] <cousteau> For example, US uses "résumé" where UK uses "cv" (one- or two-page work summary), but in US the "cv" is more what in UK is the "vita" (longer detailed list of jobs) 
[14:28:15] <cousteau> porphyry: compared to each other 
[14:28:38] <ychaouche> also in the spelling I think, like color / colour ?
[14:28:52] <porphyry> cousteau: quite minimal.
[14:29:11] <cousteau> Also some job positions, responsibilities, technical terms etc may be different 
[14:29:30] <porphyry> there are some trivial differences in formal english around the world.
[14:29:37] <porphyry> not enough to be a problem tho.
[14:29:41] <blkshp> English*
[14:29:47] <blkshp> CAPITAL 'E' :D
[14:30:08] <cousteau> They're not trivial when they are important.
[14:30:10] <porphyry> blkshp: what?
[14:30:19] <porphyry> cousteau: which is almost never.
[14:30:44] <blkshp> porphyry: What whaT?
[14:30:53] <blkshp> English has a capital letter.
[14:31:08] <blkshp> As does England, France, Germany and Fred.
[14:31:33] <porphyry> blkshp: i've come here before but was never corrected for spelling or punctuation. is this new?
[14:31:47] <cousteau> "Send us your CV" - understanding exactly which one they mean could mean getting the job or not.  That's pretty damn important, isn't it?

[14:32:18] <porphyry> cousteau: CV is understood everywhere. as is resume or biodata or vita, etc.
[14:32:34] <porphyry> cousteau: as i said, it's not as important.
[14:32:38] <cousteau> They're not the same thing though 
[14:33:00] <porphyry> cousteau: i think you're taking it too literally.
[14:33:08] <ychaouche> degree means diploma and graduating means getting a degree ? 
[14:33:12] <ychaouche> any degree / any diploma
[14:33:35] <cousteau> One is a one page summary you use as a "personal advertisement"; the other contains detailed information which may be required to be written in a specific format 
[14:33:37] <porphyry> ychaouche: do you want to write this in your resume?
[14:33:43] <ychaouche> yeah
[14:33:54] <porphyry> ychaouche: what do you have?
[14:33:58] <ychaouche> can I say "after graduating" if I only had a BSC ? 
[14:34:05] <porphyry> ychaouche: sure.
[14:34:08] <ychaouche> or does it only apply to PhD, Masters and the like ? 
[14:34:21] <porphyry> ychaouche: if you have a BSc you're a graduate.
[14:34:39] <cousteau> porphyry: don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that they're different languages or anything, of course two different English speakers can maintain a normal conversation without problems 
[14:34:53] <ychaouche> ok, so undergrad means you have K12 (Baccalaureate)
[14:35:04] <cousteau> But there are times, where a technical  term is important 
[14:35:11] <cousteau> And different 
[14:35:16] <porphyry> ychaouche: undergraduate is not a qualification. it's a state of studying in the university.
[14:35:29] <cousteau> And US speakers will assume their audience understands what it means 
[14:35:34] <porphyry> ychaouche: you can say you're a high school graduate or passout if you don't have Bachelors.

[14:35:40] <cousteau> And so will UK speakers 
[14:36:04] <ychaouche> ok porphyry that filled a lot gaps, thanks :)
[14:37:12] <cousteau> So it's important to keep track of those and know the context, otherwise you can end up being incorrect when it matters the most. 
[14:37:40] <porphyry> cousteau: the point is the entire world speaks English.
[14:38:06] <porphyry> cousteau: it's quite homogenised, unlike Icelandic probably.
[14:38:28] <porphyry> cousteau: disregard that. it came out wrong.
[14:38:32] <cousteau> I doubt Icelandic is less homogenized than English 
[14:38:34] <cousteau> Yeah 
[14:39:09] <cousteau> I mean, there's only like 300k people speaking it in a tiny island, no way it has more dialects than English 
[14:39:35] <porphyry> cousteau: i was thinking of something else and typed something else.
[14:39:38] <porphyry> cousteau: never mind.
[14:39:41] <cousteau> Haha
[14:40:27] <cousteau> I guess I understand your point though.  English is pretty much universal for basic usage at least. 
[14:40:46] <porphyry> cousteau: i feel the US v UK or US v UK v AU comparison doesn't help as English is spoken by many more people around the world.
[14:41:23] <cousteau> But when you start getting technical, with some terms that are domain-specific, you need to be aware of the meaning of those terms and the regional differences, if you are to use that technical language 
[14:42:17] <cousteau> porphyry: well, "American English" and "British/International English" seem to be the two major variants 
[14:42:32] <huf> eh
[14:42:37] <porphyry> cousteau: i wouldn't go far as to call them variants.
[14:42:38] <huf> international isnt british
[14:42:41] <huf> it's whatever the fuck it is
[14:43:11] <porphyry> cousteau: and there are far more "variants" if you start counting. 
[14:43:32] <Skunky> there's english, and there's "simple english"  and then there's american.  "yo man, talk american, none of that mexican shit"
[14:43:35] <porphyry> cousteau: also, American is the internationally popular version.
[14:43:41] <cousteau> I've seen British English referred to as "international".  As in, "the one typically used by countries that don't speak English natively, and had to pick one variant" 
[14:43:52] <huf> yeeeeah maybe they thik it is
[14:44:01] <huf> our english teachers thought they were teaching oxford english
[14:44:11] <cousteau> For example, official English documents in Europe are written in a UK-looking variant 
[14:44:13] <porphyry> cousteau: you know, i actually started this discussion so that we don't reach this point. this is like debating angels on pins.
[14:44:14] <huf> they werent. it was full-on continental english
[14:44:27] <huf> cousteau: the EU has its own slightly different usage of english
[14:44:30] <huf> it's been studied :)
[14:44:36] <pussipupu> EU English is very much its own dialect
[14:44:50] <cousteau> with spelling such as centre, acknowledgement, colour... 
[14:44:51] <porphyry> pussipupu: hold it. dialect? clearly you don't know what it means.
[14:44:58] <Skunky> cousteau: what an international decides to teach tends to be very dependent on where they're getting their english exposure from.  from US based movies and TV shows? they're gonna learn americanisms.  from commonwealth exposure? they'll get british...
[14:45:27] <huf> porphyry: lol what
[14:45:31] <pussipupu> Partly because of its international nature and partly because it's often quasi-legalise
[14:45:33] <porphyry> what i like about English is that there is no governing authority.
[14:45:52] <porphyry> huf: what?
[14:45:59] <cousteau> Well, that can be somewhat problematic 
[14:46:02] <porphyry> so such discussions are almost meaningless.
[14:46:11] <porphyry> cousteau: what's problematic?
[14:46:14] <cousteau> That means anyone can decide any word means anything 
[14:46:27] <porphyry> cousteau: that's true in general.
[14:46:27] <cousteau> Not having a centralized governing body 
[14:46:41] <cousteau> Not being standardized in any way 
[14:46:43] <porphyry> cousteau: a centralised body for language is quite stupid.
[14:46:47] <huf> do you think it's the centralized body that decides this for other languages?
[14:46:58] <huf> and do you think english isnt standardized?
[14:47:15] <cousteau> It pretty much defies the purpose of having a language.  What good is it to have a way to communicate if each person interprets it differently? 
[14:47:29] <porphyry> cousteau: it's true by definition.
[14:47:34] <cousteau> Or, how do you know how to speak it correctly? 
[14:47:43] <porphyry> cousteau: i mean, philosophically it's not even possible.
[14:47:50] <porphyry> cousteau: haha.
[14:47:51] <huf> cousteau: you learn it from others
[14:48:05] <cousteau> What if the others are wrong? 
[14:48:05] <huf> cousteau: do you think people were constantly confused before the modern state?
[14:48:14] <huf> they were doing fine even back in the tribal days
[14:48:17] <huf> able to use language
[14:48:29] <porphyry> no language needs a governing authority.
[14:48:32] <huf> with no literacy, no formal education system, no institutions to govern language at all
[14:48:43] <porphyry> let a thousand flowers bloom, or whatever.
[14:48:45] <cousteau> Yeah, when each tribe had their own language used by like 5 people 
[14:49:03] <huf> is that how you think it worked?
[14:49:05] <huf> why?
[14:49:11] <Guest4439> wat 
[14:49:37] <cousteau> Now you need a guy from Portland talking to a guy in Japan and having both understand each other

[14:49:45] <porphyry> cousteau: language purist and grammar nazi, that's what you are.
[14:49:47] <huf> built by 5 people
[14:49:51] <huf> who could barely understand each other
[14:49:57] <huf> history of the world according to cousteau 
[14:50:00] <porphyry> cousteau: i'm sorry if that's offensive.
[14:50:22] <cousteau> porphyry: not more than it was intended :D
[14:50:38] <porphyry> cousteau: but it's a very stupid cause. that's intended.
[14:52:03] <cousteau> porphyry: anyway, my point was that sometimes you MUST use different phrases (not should, not may, MUST) in specific/"technical" contexts where you have to be correct 
[14:52:37] <huf> sure
[14:52:43] <huf> but it aint the governing body that makes that happen
[14:53:12] <huf> people who write elementary school textbooks have more of an effect on language than those academic weirdoes
[14:53:40] *** Joins: rooo (~gjsgjsag@109-186-219-9.bb.netvision.net.il)
[14:53:47] <porphyry> in legal docs, words at defined at the beginning to remove ambiguities.
[14:54:03] <cousteau> A governing body can mean there is at least "a standard", or a set of standards, so you can adhere to one and know that others will too 
[14:54:06] <porphyry> cousteau: a governing authority can't do much more than that.
[14:54:25] <porphyry> cousteau: it's not a programming language. it's a human language.
[14:54:55] <porphyry> cousteau: the most they can do employ even more grammar nazis to correct the spellings, etc.
[14:55:32] <blkshp> grammar Nazis*
[14:55:38] <porphyry> language is whatever the speakers want it to be.
[14:55:47] <blkshp> Not in France.
[14:55:50] <huf> yes in france
[14:55:54] <blkshp> :D
[14:55:55] <huf> this is a typically anglo myth
[14:55:57] <huf> please stop repeating it
[14:56:06] <cousteau> I don't really think spelling is a problem, like I couldn't care less if you write color or colour, or even a lot or alot
[14:56:14] <blkshp> Shan't.
[14:56:16] <porphyry> i hate grammar Nazional Socialists.
[14:56:22] <blkshp> I*
[14:56:25] * blkshp hides
[14:56:35] <cousteau> The real problem is when it can be ambiguous 
[14:56:50] <porphyry> cousteau: i've told you. that's not how it works.
[14:56:54] <blkshp> huf: I heard the people had an outcry when they wanted to change the spelling of oignion.
[14:57:00] <huf> blkshp: yeah
[14:57:03] <huf> so?
[14:57:11] <huf> do you think those people changed the way they spell?
[14:57:20] <blkshp> So it's only if the people want it actually are allowed to have it.
[14:57:23] <huf> did the police go out to enforce it?
[14:57:30] <blkshp> Well they should :)
[14:57:33] <cousteau> Or when you are writing for some important target (e.g. a journal article) and don't want it to look like an idiot wrote it 
[14:57:33] <huf> nah
[14:57:35] <porphyry> was it Dead Kennedys who said, "Grammar Nazis, f**k off"?
[14:58:06] <porphyry> cousteau: i want it to look like an idiot wrote it to any grammar Nazi who reads my article.
[14:58:28] <blkshp> Can we stop saying 'grammar Nazi' now?
[14:58:46] <huf> nyelvtannáci then.
[14:58:48] <porphyry> i feel there should be no capitalisation in English either. it makes no sense.
[14:58:50] <huf> comma fucker!
[14:59:01] <blkshp> porphyry: It makes sense.
[14:59:15] <porphyry> plenty of other languages survive without capital letters.
[14:59:15] <rooo> I places I tend to frequent the most, are the ones that I usually have access to their kitchen, and as such I get to see things that I might disapprove of, while I won't be aware of what's going on at random places, since I won't access to their kitchen.
[14:59:18] <blkshp> We'll go back to the one from the other day"
[14:59:25] <cousteau> Example of the latter: I've wasted way too long trying to figure out if I should write "data" as singular or plural 
[14:59:26] <rooo> Is there a name to describe this 'conflict'? 
[14:59:37] <rooo> The places that I tend*
[14:59:39] <blkshp> porphyry: "I helped my uncle Jack off a horse" vs "I helped my uncle jack off a horse"
[14:59:44] <blkshp> There's a lot fo difference.
[15:00:15] <huf> cousteau: I'm p sure a fairly quick google answers that
[15:00:25] <huf> and no governing body will explain all usage
[15:00:33] <ychaouche> humm... not sure of the usage of the word "pursue" here : Fast forward 15 years, I am now at Paris 8 University in Saint-Denis, France, in the suburbs of Paris, where I'm pursuing my BSC in computer systems and networking.
[15:00:41] <huf> you'd still have to just ask speakers about things
[15:00:47] <ychaouche> what's the correct word I should use instead ? 
[15:01:03] <ychaouche> "where I'm <> my BSC" 
[15:01:05] <ychaouche> preparing ? 
[15:01:10] <ychaouche> studying for ? 
[15:01:16] <blkshp> Studying for
[15:01:18] <ychaouche> ok
[15:01:20] <blkshp> But persuing is fine.
[15:01:24] <ychaouche> oh really ? 
[15:01:36] <blkshp> I think so.
[15:01:45] <ychaouche> ok then, I'll leave pursuing, is it persuing with en e ? 
[15:02:02] <blkshp> What else would it be?
[15:02:05] <blkshp> oh
[15:02:11] <blkshp> derr.. can't read again
[15:02:14] <blkshp> Yes
[15:03:21] <ychaouche> it says here persue is an old form of pursue : https://www.askdifference.com/pursue-vs-persue/
[15:03:47] <blkshp> Damn it.
[15:03:53] <blkshp> Pursue then.
[15:04:01] <ychaouche> ^^'
[15:04:02] <cousteau> porphyry: for some reason, English keeps the capital letter when a term is derived from a capitalized term (e.g. England -> English; Descartes/Cartesius -> Cartesian).  Other languages don't do this, e.g. Spanish (Inglaterra -> inglés; Descartes/Cartesius -> cartesiano) 
[15:04:03] <blkshp> Another one I have spelt wrong forever then
[15:04:17] <cousteau> It's arbitrary, but hey, at least it's consistent 
[15:04:29] <cousteau> Personally I'd get rid of capitals too 
[15:04:46] <blkshp> cousteau: No, bad.
[15:04:47] <blkshp> :D
[15:05:30] <cousteau> And i would definitely get rid of the capital i 
[15:05:33] <porphyry> blkshp: i'm back. i'm sorry i was busy getting my uncle jack off the horse.
[15:05:52] <blkshp> lol
[15:06:38] * blkshp implements a 10 errors and you're out protocol.
[15:07:25] <rooo> Anybody bothered reading my silly kitchen analogy question?
[15:07:27] <porphyry> blkshp: that's not an argument though. it's just a humorous pun. i have a better reason. i hate having to press the shift key. that's much more annoying than occassionaly getting confused between mounting and masturbatrion.
[15:07:36] <cousteau> rooo: I wasn't sure what you meant 
[15:07:48] <cousteau> You mean "out of sight, out of  mind"? 
[15:08:24] <rooo> cousteau, Like, I will be aware of any small issue with the places I know, but won't know of even big issues with the places I don't know
[15:08:34] <porphyry> rooo: i'm sorry.
[15:08:39] <cousteau> Or more like, the paradox by which the more you get to know something, the less you like it? 
[15:08:40] <porphyry> rooo: did you ask a question there?
[15:08:42] <blkshp> porphyry:  will never agree that "because I don't think it's right" is a reason to ignore basic grammar and spelling rules, I will just choose to ignore you until i feel that you're being detremental.
[15:09:09] <rooo> porphyry, Yes, I would like to know if there's a name for this 'conflict' or analogy or what else to call it
[15:09:27] <huf> moses came off the mountain with the rules of grammar
[15:09:32] <huf> who are we to question it
[15:09:45] <blkshp> I don't think he did!
[15:09:46] <porphyry> blkshp: i've got a OPD about these things. if i start thinking about grammar mistakes, i'd have to restart my application every time i make a spelling or grammar mistake in the conversation.
[15:09:57] <porphyry> blkshp: that's why i keep making mistakes to keep it in check.
[15:10:28] <rooo> cousteau, I'm not sure if that's exactly that, but I guess it's closer than nothing
[15:11:04] <blkshp> I have no idea what that's supposed to mean porphyry
[15:11:19] <porphyry> blkshp: OCD?
[15:11:28] <porphyry> blkshp: never mind.
[15:11:42] <cousteau> blkshp: in porphyry's defense, your example was just one fabricated example where an uppercase letterjust happens to solve the ambiguity.  There may be other examples where uppercase letters don't help solve any ambiguity, and one example that is more a joke than an example but makes a lot of noise because of its implications isn't a good argument, more like a fallacy 
[15:12:06] <porphyry> rooo: can you repeat the situation again?
[15:12:14] <porphyry> rooo: i don't get much from what you wrote over there.
[15:12:51] <blkshp> There are so many times when people that think they have the ability to just not use the correct capital letter, punctuation mark, quotes or whatever are ambiguous to the reader but not to the writer and, quite frankly, it gets a lttle tedious.
[15:13:20] <porphyry> blkshp: i agree. it does. just look at the tweets.
[15:13:25] <blkshp> I would like it that, where possible the people in this channel could be a good example to the others coming in without all this God forsaken arguing each bloody time.
[15:13:27] <cousteau> rooo: do you want to focus on the fact that there's something you know and don't like it because of that, or that there's something you don't know and you like it because of that?  (For the latter, "out of sight, out of mind" might do the job) 
[15:14:05] <blkshp> But, I have been overruled in this regard before so, yeah.
[15:14:18] <porphyry> blkshp: my grammar was correct. it's just that if i start thinking about capitalisation and get a comma or letter wrong i can't continue in the application. it's a situation.
[15:14:22] <rooo> porphyry, The restaurants/places that I frequent, are the ones I'll have access to visit their kitchens, and therefore be aware of any slight issue that I might disapprove of. At the same time, I won't have any 'known' issues with random places, since I'm not likely to have access to their kitchen and reveal such things
[15:14:47] <blkshp> But you are getting them wrong and not having to restart so I'm not sure what you're trying to say.
[15:14:52] <porphyry> rooo: are you a food inspector?
[15:14:57] <rooo> porphyry, No :)
[15:15:05] <porphyry> blkshp: that's deliberate.
[15:15:14] <porphyry> blkshp: never mind, man.
[15:15:21] <rooo> cousteau, I think maybe the combination of both? Maybe I'm asking for too much and there's nothing to describe it accurately?
[15:15:45] <blkshp> So you can be wrong if you decide your wrong is not as wrong as it would be were you wrong without knowing it's wrong before the wrong. Got it.
[15:16:03] <porphyry> rooo: so, you're basically saying, "i don't know what i don't know" and need a word for that?
[15:16:54] <blkshp> apathetc ignorance.
[15:17:00] <porphyry> blkshp: yes, i make my own rules and today i'm on free fall. the problem is that if i think about following rules i'd freak out because i'd second guess everything i type.
[15:17:12] <cousteau> I know a saying that is literally the opposite, "better the devil you know than the devil you don't", but of course in that case it focuses on what's more convenient to you than on what you'll like more 
[15:17:22] <porphyry> blkshp: and that's very very exhausting. you'd see me quitting every 1 minute. it's a condition.
[15:17:43] <blkshp> Ok, but there are times I will correct you on this channel.
[15:17:46] <Jong> In the sentence "they have the ability to just not use the correct capital letter", isn't there a split infinitive?
[15:17:48] <rooo> porphyry, Well yes, I don't know what I don't know, but it doesn't really describe the contrast of the places that I do know, having all their issues known
[15:18:09] <Jong> Shouldn't it be "ability not to just use" ?
[15:18:19] <porphyry> rooo: can you tell me where you're going to use this?
[15:18:20] <rooo> cousteau, Actually it's much closer, thanks
[15:18:45] <rooo> porphyry, I think cousteau's "better the devil you know than the devil you don't" is as close as I can get with the analogy I wanted
[15:19:01] <rooo> Thanks a lot guys!
[15:19:04] <cousteau> In Spanish it goes one step further and says "better the known bad one than the unknown good one", meaning that sometimes it's better to just go with one option you know even if there may be (or are) better ones 
[15:19:14] <porphyry> rooo: got it. i thought you were looking for a technical term for it.
[15:19:18] <porphyry> rooo: sure.
[15:19:32] <rooo> cousteau, Yes seems even harsher
[15:19:36] <porphyry> cousteau: better the devil you know than the angel you don't.
[15:19:46] <rooo> Sold!
[15:19:48] <cousteau> I've never seen that one 
[15:20:00] <porphyry> cousteau: of course not. it's a joke.
[15:20:06] <cousteau> Did you make it up or has it been used before? 
[15:20:13] <porphyry> cousteau: made it up.
[15:20:13] <Jong> Is anyone here on any other irc network?
[15:20:17] <rooo> Google says it exists
[15:20:20] <rooo> and it's perfect!
[15:20:22] <cousteau> OK, because I did think of that one too... 
[15:20:23] <rooo> porphyry, Thanks!
[15:20:25] <Jong> Are there other irc networks with a good english channel?
[15:20:50] <porphyry> Jong: i don't know if there are any good Ingurisu channels like this one.
[15:20:50] <cousteau> Like, "why not say 'angel' and make the translation work?" 
[15:21:10] <cousteau> Jong: I don't know of any 
[15:21:14] <MetaNova> Jong: that are English /language/ by topic? I don't know of any
[15:21:19] <porphyry> Jong: now that i see the nick, probably a bad joke.
[15:21:26] <porphyry> Jong: never mind.
[15:21:38] <cousteau> There used to be Freenode.  No idea if its ##English channel is still active 
[15:21:53] <MetaNova> lol
[15:21:55] <MetaNova> guys, guys
[15:22:17] <MetaNova> /whois Jong
[15:22:18] <Jong> So... irc has been around for over 20 years, is network is all that's left of it? I checked out other irc networks and all others are practically dead
[15:22:26] <MetaNova> * [Jong] (~Jae@2620:10d:c090:400::5:c08c)
[15:22:31] <MetaNova> $ curl ipinfo.io/2620:10d:c090:400::5:c08c
[15:22:37] <MetaNova> "region": "California", "org": "AS54115 Facebook Inc",
[15:22:46] <MetaNova> Jong: so, you work for Facebook
[15:22:52] <MetaNova> how do you like it?
[15:23:57] <Jong> It's fine. I think there's a #facebook channel where you can interview other facebook people
[15:24:05] <MetaNova> to answer your question, libera.chat is the living spirit that was freenode, before the current owner decided to ... make changes
[15:24:06] <cousteau> Jong: this network isn't even focused in this sort of topic, it's more oriented to open source software projects 
[15:24:12] <redempt1on> And I smell like shit.
[15:24:28] <cousteau> Of which I know several other networks.  OFTC, GimpNet... 
[15:24:38] <MetaNova> Jong: as such, we are largely focused on FOSS, this channel (and other channels like it) are a side-effect of having so many users
[15:24:39] <porphyry> Jong: also, Snoonet.
[15:24:46] <porphyry> Jong: and Tilde.
[15:25:07] <MetaNova> Jong: http://netsplit.de is a good reference point for the IRC landscape
[15:25:11] <cousteau> MetaNova: libera is basically Freenode with the name changed 
[15:25:20] <MetaNova> cousteau: yes, thanks
[15:25:28] <MetaNova> I was here when it happened
[15:26:11] <porphyry> Libera is a better name.
[15:26:17] <MetaNova> cousteau: the entire reason I migrated (and helped everyone I could migrate) was that I trust the people actually running the place
[15:26:21] <cousteau> Only, it's not like they changed its name, they just moved servers, ops, channels, users, etc to another network with another name, until it effectively became the original but with a different name 
[15:26:52] <cousteau> MetaNova: I made the mistake of  giving them the benefit of doubt for, like, one week 
[15:26:54] <MetaNova> well, if you retain the leadership, the userbase, the focus, and the projects ... the name is just cosmetic
[15:27:55] <MetaNova> Jong: I didn't mean anything negative by pointing out you work for Facebook, it's just really neat any time someone from a large corporation is spotted on IRC
[15:28:04] <cousteau> Until it became clear I wasn't in the right side of the argument.  I had already registered here anyway.  Then all nicks got dropped and I didn't bother reregistering
[15:28:47] <huf> https://i.redd.it/xvr1wwb0sos71.jpg
[15:28:48] <huf> relevant
[15:28:58] <MetaNova> yeah. I knew it was all going to go up in flames, then they changed ircd /and/ wiped the database/moved services ..
[15:29:19] <porphyry> huf: ye
[15:30:07] <porphyry> huf: reminds me of the cardinal who said something to the effect that he would find cause for hanging in any 6 sentences written by anyone in the country.
[15:30:15] <MetaNova> Jong: this network is not all that is left, no. I'm on half a dozen other networks, for specific channels/users, and I even run two other (much smaller) networks myself, but this one gets most of my attention
[15:30:19] <porphyry> s/would/could/
[15:30:19] <chat> porphyry meant to say: huf: reminds me of the cardinal who said something to the effect that he could find cause for hanging in any 6 sentences written by anyone in the country.
[15:30:36] <Jong> MetaNova  do you code?
[15:31:08] <porphyry> clearly this man's diction didn't save him from the noose.
[15:31:34] <MetaNova> Jong: I contribute to opensource projects through administering various aspects of the projects, but I don't code myself, no.  in college, I took courses in Java, C, C++, ASM, it's just not my thing

[16:27:44] <ychaouche> In french, we usually say I have a diploma in IT, "option" and then you describe what specialty of IT you were in, like systems, networks, software engineering etc.
[16:27:51] <ychaouche> do you also use that in english ? 
[16:28:14] <ychaouche> for example : i have a degree in IT, with a specialty in systems and networks.
[16:28:21] <ychaouche> Does that sound natural ? 
[16:40:59] <MetaNova> ychaouche: that sounds fine
[16:41:14] <ychaouche> Thanks MetaNova
[16:41:18] <MetaNova> alternatively, you'll hear "I have a degree in IT, and I majored in systems and networks."
[16:41:44] <MetaNova> "I majored in" being a very common substitute for, "with a speciality in"
[16:42:05] <ychaouche> I think I heard one time my big borther talking about how studies are in the US, where you need to have a major and a minor, whatever you're studying
[16:42:13] <ychaouche> like, major in IT, minor in marketing
[16:42:14] <MetaNova> yes
[16:42:15] <ychaouche> something like that
[16:42:19] <MetaNova> very common
[16:42:56] <ychaouche> and you can choose your minor freely ?
[16:43:00] <MetaNova> (and "my major was")
[16:43:11] <MetaNova> ychaouche: I believe so, yes
[16:43:17] <ychaouche> cool
[16:43:28] <MetaNova> at least, when I was in college, I had no limitations on what I could specify as my minor, to my knowledge

[17:33:58] <MetaNova> cousteau: it's not exactly the same, no
[17:34:18] <MetaNova> but there is a large similarity between them
[17:34:38] <cousteau> For example, you can be an industrial engineer, but halfway of the degree you'll choose one among the specialties of Automatics & Electronics, Chemical, Materials, Organization, Structures... 
[17:35:06] <ychaouche> yes, it's still in the same field
[17:35:12] <MetaNova> cousteau: to be fair, it's not unheard of (for an American) to say, eg "I majored in Psychology, specializing in early childhood development"
[17:35:13] <ychaouche> same here in DZ or in FR
[17:35:35] <cousteau> There's a list of 9 options in Industrial Engineering in my uni, each with a set of specialized subjects, and then some common subjects that are the same across all specialties 
[17:36:32] <cousteau> Oh... I assumed you were in France -.-"

[17:36:36] <MetaNova> cousteau: I answered ychaouche with the impression of them using "specializing" (or "specialized") as a stand-in for "major"
[17:36:45] <MetaNova> cousteau: I am an American
[17:36:56] <cousteau> No, I meant ychaouche 
[17:37:24] <MetaNova> oh
[17:37:25] <ychaouche> I lived there for a short period of time
[17:37:29] <MetaNova> I presumed they were
[17:37:34] <MetaNova> oh
[17:37:36] <ychaouche> did my university there
[17:37:38] <cousteau> Oh wait, so the major99,99 is the "specialty", not the minor 
[17:37:41] <ychaouche> worked for 3 years
[17:37:54] <cousteau> Oh I see 
[17:38:01] <MetaNova> cousteau: the major may or may not contain a speciality, the minor is something _completely_ separate
[17:38:15] <MetaNova> "I majored in Agriculture, with a minor in Art History"
[17:38:17] <MetaNova> (for example)
[17:38:23] <cousteau> Hmm
[17:38:40] <cousteau> Yeah I'm not familiar with anything like that 
[17:41:27] <cousteau> There used to be the "license" and the "diploma" or something like that, or the "higher" and "technical" degree 
[17:41:35] <cousteau> Maybe that was it 
[17:43:43] <cousteau> And people just choose one or the other depending on how much time they plan to spend in university (one was only 3-4 years, the other 5-6) before they started in a job, and how much responsibility their potential job could take (sign projects and manage them vs only work in them, etc) 
[17:45:08] <cousteau> But that was more like an "either or" than an "I choose X as my major and Y as my minor, so that if I don't find a job at X I can still do Y"

[18:33:12] <ychaouche> not sure of the usage of domestic here : I perfected my python developing skills while at AD Display, a domestic leader in the outdoors advertising sector
[18:33:32] <ychaouche> I thought of domestic in comparison to domestic flights
[18:33:47] <ychaouche> by contrast to regional / international 
[18:35:13] <cousteau> I've heard of "domestic" as "internal to a country", although I think the original meaning is "internal to a house" 
[18:35:32] <cousteau> (from Greek "domos", house, I think) 
[18:35:49] <cousteau> I'd use "national" for that anyway 
[18:37:10] <ychaouche> good suggestion
[18:37:19] <cousteau> I think "domestic" has a more legal meaning when used as "national", as in "internal, with no relations with the outside" 
[18:41:28] <cousteau> domestic. 4. Internal to a specific country. 
[18:42:30] <cousteau> I think "internal" is the important word there.  It makes no sense in your context, unless you meant "allowed to operate exclusively in that country" 
[18:43:03] <cousteau> But you mean "leader but only nation-wide, not world-wide" 
[18:44:53] <MetaNova> <ychaouche> for example : eventually / eventuellement
[18:45:08] <MetaNova> the -ment makes me suspect eventuellement may mean, "result [of]"

[18:45:58] <ychaouche> MetaNova: no, it means maybe
