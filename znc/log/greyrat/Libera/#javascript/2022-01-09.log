[00:00:31] <packet_lozenge> it depends on where in the US too. there's some weird restrictions on title in some states Texas and Ohio, but it's really only important if you do contractor work/consulting
[00:00:42] <systemfault> onosendi: These days, we're writing grpc-based microservices using typescript and a homemade event-driven framework
[00:00:54] <systemfault> onosendi: But I've used a lot of languages and frameworks over the years..
[00:01:27] <KevinX> I prefer developer over engineer. Not sure why though. But I might start using webmaster now
[00:01:30] <systemfault> But since the Node world doesn't like traditional frameworks then you end up building your own (more or less) from a lot of packages

[00:02:50] <onosendi> systemfault: ah, cool. I enjoy working on the backend too.
[00:03:06] <systemfault> I could be a software engineer where I live but I would have to finish a software engineering degree
[00:03:56] <systemfault> onosendi: My title changed a lot over the years... started as a frontend programmer... then became fullstack then backend
[00:04:36] <systemfault> I was backend developers who took the first offer I could get and it happened to be frontend
[00:04:56] <systemfault> Learned frontend on the spot at work... that was quite an adventure.
[00:04:57] <matsaman> sounds better than fullstack
[00:05:10] <KevinX> I'm self taught so i was never given a term. The project lead where I work calls me the lead engineer but I cringe a bit when I hear it

[00:09:47] <silly> not going isn't really an option

[02:50:11] <demonii> gotcha
[02:50:23] <cornfeedhobo> brb let me try a little more. oscurochu's link might be working with a few more changes
[02:50:30] <demonii> legacy code is PITA
[02:50:31] <oscurochu> recreate the example first before using it in your code.
[02:50:56] <cornfeedhobo> it's the worst. and i'm porting lambda code back to express. it's a garbled mess
[02:51:10] <cornfeedhobo> thanks i'll bbiab
[02:51:26] <demonii> oh boy. i find facades useful when porting code
[02:53:37] <cornfeedhobo> .bind works as expected. thanks again!
[02:53:57] <oscurochu> when ever i try to do something new for the first time and incorporate it into my code immediately, it usually doesn't work right. I usually have to isolate the functionality im trying to achieve. i've gotten lucky many times with stuff just working though also.

[03:24:03] <systemfault> Well, that's weird... glad it works now
[03:24:39] <onosendi> I hate when that happens. I usually try to get it to break again so I can figure out why it broke in the first place.
[03:25:06] <velix> What's the sense to make js, css, img Cache-Control: public? Why not Cache-Control: no-cache and Etag?
[03:25:26] <oscurochu> what helped was to get out of the whole testing environment, and just test things the "hard" way. jest complains too much. then once i got it working, suddenly it worked with jest without an issue.

[05:55:40] <oscurochu> the more tests i write, the more i like them. there is nothing more satisying than a script that tells me all my functions are working the way intend for them to work, and  that they won't break in ways i expect them to get broken.

[06:09:22] <oscurochu> so i really need to figure out this mock stuff next. i've been using the main database to test with. im thinking of the best way to point the tests to the live test database.
[06:10:36] <theskillwithin> if im building the frontend before backend has started their work, I like to use axios mock adapter
[06:12:12] <packet_lozenge> Are these integration tests? Why not mock out the DB calls?
[06:12:15] <oscurochu> im working in the backend
[06:12:46] <oscurochu> thats what im talking about, also.
[06:13:04] <oscurochu> so ill write an example
[06:13:59] <oscurochu> savedatabase.js: saveToDatabase() { pool = new Pool().connect(); }
[06:14:14] <oscurochu> then it the test file, i would import saveToDatabase
[06:14:50] <lf94> fastest way to feed points into something and draw the lines in js?
[06:15:19] <oscurochu> i wasn't sure if i should instead do saveToDatabase(pool);
[06:15:37] <packet_lozenge> If you're using Jest, why not use Jest Mocks or spies?
[06:15:55] <oscurochu> i was reading about both of those.

[10:32:00] <DumbDog> I was super sad to learn about GreenJello. I changed my nick to this because of him. I used to use GreenDog and people would always tab-complete it wrong.

[10:32:53] <rick123> Don't worry, I stopped coming here 6 yrs ago (on freenode) and have not worked on JS since then. I'm slowly getting back now.
[10:33:01] <theskillwithin> rustyshackleford look at the first line in the topic to see about GreenJello
[10:33:28] <rustyshackleford> at age 27? WTF
[10:33:40] <theskillwithin> ya its really sad 😢
[10:33:51] <DumbDog> SOrry to bring it up. Figured everyone knew.
[10:34:08] <rustyshackleford> what a shame
[10:34:09] <theskillwithin> its surprising how many people don't look at the topic, a lot probably don't know yet
[10:34:22] <rustyshackleford> why'd he spend so much time learning js if he was gonna do that?
[10:34:32] <DumbDog> Last night, when I first came back, I first went to Freenode. Looked for GreenJello, saw he wasn't there, so figured the channel moved here.

[10:35:08] <rustyshackleford> one of those that you can only reproduce sometimes
[10:35:50] <DumbDog> I've had depression my entire life. It's a bitch. What's worse is it's really easy to hide so no one knows.

[10:37:48] <theskillwithin> DumbDog ya its a very real thing
[10:38:15] <rustyshackleford> my neighbor offed himself like 8 years ago
[10:38:28] <rustyshackleford> kinda snapped me back to my senses
[10:38:38] <theskillwithin> rustyshackleford me and systemfault notice he was missing for a bit, which is not like him, so we reached out to a former employer of ours that we worked with in common with him, and he was able to pull his emergency contacts and reported back to us the bad news
[10:39:26] <theskillwithin> on new years I emailed that memorial gist to his mother

[10:46:02] <DumbDog> In another channel I'm in, we had a guy have a heart attack and die while online. It was really weird. He deopped a lot of people, typed a lot of gibberish, and then nothing
[10:46:37] <DumbDog> Another op knew his info and was able to get ahold of his sister somehow, who went over to his house and found he had passed.
[10:48:48] <DumbDog> Then 8 months or so later, another op typed a bunch of gibberish and stopped responding. We were worried because it was similar to the previous incident, we thought maybe she was crying out for help in the same way. We wound up having an op from the united state call her local police department in australia. She was fortunately fine.

[11:46:25] <oscurochu> because that function doesn't like ~/ path's
[11:46:43] <oscurochu> i dont know why. my imports dont care what the path looks like
[11:46:53] <silly> ~/ is the absolute path
[11:47:00] <silly> i don't like

[11:48:06] <silly> because
[11:48:50] <oscurochu> i do that 99% of the time... but sometimes its really annoyingtrying to figure out how deep i need to go with ../ lol
[11:48:56] <silly> or did you ask why it is annoying?
[11:49:01] <packet_lozenge> yeah, using tilde in your imports isn't very conventional
[11:49:03] <silly> i don't know that
[11:49:06] <theskillwithin> I use absolute paths for imports, that way if I refactor things to be in a different folder it takes a lot less typing
[11:49:36] <silly> theskillwithin, don't say absolute when you mean relative
[11:49:53] <oscurochu> ~/ is absolute
[11:49:57] <packet_lozenge> as for your code. hmm... maybe try the methods described for ES6 module mocking? https://jestjs.io/docs/es6-class-mocks
[11:49:59] <oscurochu> ./ is reletive
[11:50:20] <theskillwithin> silly i mean absolute
[11:50:55] <silly> absolute path - relative to your project root?
[11:51:16] <theskillwithin> ya well can't import anything outside my project root, so ya
[11:51:41] <silly> but you need extra configuration for that right?
[11:52:17] <theskillwithin> sure
[11:52:36] <silly> twice
[11:53:05] <silly> once e.g. in webpack and another in eslint
[11:53:05] <theskillwithin> its minimal configuration
[11:53:21] <theskillwithin> btw I don't like using the ~ as alias for it
[11:53:38] <theskillwithin> just haz baseRoot be .
[11:54:01] <theskillwithin> so u can do 'src/wtver'  instead of '~/src/wtver'.   the later is ugly to me

[11:54:44] <packet_lozenge> I do that as well. I prefer relative paths but sometimes absolute (relative to project root) is easier

[11:55:24] <oscurochu> so i dont know if maybe this is the problem, but i have doMock('/path/to/mock/pool') in my test file, but the functionality being mocked is in a function imported outside of the test file

[15:27:45] <rick123> silly: So I guess its because of CF proxy ? The link doesn't explain how its happening though.
[15:28:09] <rick123> The browser shouldn't make a request unless the header sends ACAO: * right ?
[15:28:22] <silly> you can make the request in your backend just fine and then pass it to your frontend
[15:29:04] <silly> i mean pass the response you got in your backend
[15:29:58] <rick123> My question is how is CORS working without the header ? Not how do I make it happen ?
[15:30:38] <hassoon> 'morning
[15:30:46] <rick123> I can make an XHR or Fetch request from http://localhost to https://api.npoint.io/17e304710e07821fbad4 - I want to understand how given npoint is not sending any ACAO: * header
[15:31:56] <hassoon> is https://api.npoint.io/ under your control ?
[15:33:04] <rick123> Nope
[15:33:39] <rick123> I am just surprised how I'm able to make CORs requests with XHR or Fetch in some cases. My understanding was you couldn't do it without the access control header. So what is it that I don't know here ?

[15:34:29] <rick123> No, a request to example.org fails due to same origin policy. But a request to these URLs don't
[15:34:59] <rick123> It is quite possible cloudflare might be doing something but eventually it has to show up somewhere in the header. I'm definitely missing something.
