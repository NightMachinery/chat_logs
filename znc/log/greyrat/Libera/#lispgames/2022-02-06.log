[00:30:46] <Jach> Hey artchad. Did you figure out your event problem? I don't use the sdl2:with-.. macros since they're not that well documented and stuffing everything in a main func like examples tend to do doesn't play nice with live reloading.
[00:34:03] <Jach> If you're interested I can peel out a pastebin of my WIP lib's (do-event (event) ...) macro and helpers for you to compare. Checking any event type is done with (= (event-type event) (sdl2-ffi:+sdl-mousebuttondown+)) or whatever, it uses plus-c:c-ref under the hood.
[00:41:08] <artchad> Jach: I'm interested.

[20:16:02] <dlowe> I think I have something

[20:16:53] <dlowe> I have other event forms
[20:16:55] <dlowe> https://github.com/dlowe-net/Hello-gl/blob/master/chap3.lisp
[20:18:14] <artchad> everything helps
[20:18:21] <artchad> any scrap of documentation or comments
[20:18:41] <artchad> a comment says something about a bitmask which contains which keys were pressed
[20:19:11] <artchad> the thing is that I don't know how the (:mousebuttondown (...) ...) form should look like
[20:19:54] <dlowe> can always look at the code :/  it's not the greatest I know
[20:20:09] *** Quits: dlowe (~dlowe@user/dlowe) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:20:25] <artchad> I'm not sure if I have the cognitive capacity for that.
[20:20:55] <artchad> I'm not really a programmer, but a creative.
[20:21:28] <artchad> I want to make games, and lisp is the greatest language for expressing ones ideas.
[20:22:10] <artchad> Thanks for the link. I didn't know that repo or the tutorial it links to.
[20:22:16] <artchad> looks useful.
[20:23:58] <artchad> dlowe: The code uses lispbuilder-sdl though.
[20:24:07] <artchad> I'm trying to use cl-sdl2
[20:24:25] <artchad> :O
[20:31:31] <mfiano> I don't really know, as I avoid the cl-sdl2 macros, as they assume that sdl2 is not running on the main thread. My setup uses cl-sdl2's low level code to avoid all that.
[20:32:00] <mfiano> and i am pretty much away for the day. installing a new 1U server :)
[20:32:50] <artchad> hm...

[20:48:13] <Jach> artchad: I'm not sure but I'd expect it to be something like the :mousemotion you shared the other day
[20:50:04] <Jach> If you checked out my pastebin, basically you need to look at https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Event and drill down into the event type struct.
[20:50:28] <Jach> Since mousebuttondown is handled by SDL_MouseButtonEvent your form would look something like (:mousebuttondown (:button button :state state :clicks clicks :x x :y y) ...) because those are the data fields exposed by the struct. Presumably you can leave off the ones you don't need.

[20:53:27] <Jach> For better or worse with SDL2 or GL the wrappers are pretty thin and require you to be familiar with some low level details (and even manually manage foreign memory), so it's not quite as nice as it could be with a higher level framework like trivial-gamekit or whatever other people have been working on...

[21:06:19] <artchad> I would used trivial-gamekit to write my games before. But I want something that works on other platforms besides Linux with glibc
[21:07:05] <artchad> I've familiarized myself with the C API, but how would I know that I should add a keyword for each field?
[21:07:10] <artchad> It's basically trial and error.

[21:08:30] <artchad> I was just about to switch to lispbuilder-sdl...now you're dragging me back to cl-sdl2. xD
[21:08:33] <artchad> LOL
[21:08:37] <Jach> Ideally you would know because the macro documentation would explain what it's doing, or the source would be easy enough to follow =P
[21:09:06] <artchad> the thing is that it's hard to inspect stuff in the REPL, because sdl2 is not CL native.
[21:09:27] <artchad> I tried inspect and break, but the returned data was not really usable
[21:09:36] <artchad> sometimes I just got an int like 1.
