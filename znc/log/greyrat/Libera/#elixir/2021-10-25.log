[10:30:11] <serafeim> Nicd: all right thanks. i just wanted to know if there was something like an `:else` keyword to the if
[10:30:46] <serafeim> to the for i mean
[10:30:50] <serafeim> something like the for else that python has: https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/for_-_else.html#else-clause
[10:31:06] <Nicd> sadly there is not
[10:31:40] <Nicd> > The else clause executes after the loop completes normally.
[10:31:43] <Nicd> that's not really useful here
[10:34:52] <serafeim> oh
[10:34:54] <serafeim> ok
[10:35:03] <serafeim> there's an else in django templates though that does what i wanted :)
[10:35:44] <serafeim> but yes it seems that python also would need to use an if 
[10:43:38] <serafeim> i'm using a select in a phoenix form: `<%= select f, :name, get_options %>`. the form is use to upgrade an object that has a value in that field. however this value is *not* pre-selected when my form is rendered

[10:45:55] <serafeim> i used something like `selected: @changeset.data.name` and it seems to be working but is this the correct way to do it ? (notice that the documentation doesn't say *anything* about this)
[10:46:38] <Nicd> > :selected - the default value to use when none was sent as parameter
[10:46:56] <Nicd> from this I assume it should work if your data is in the changeset

[15:37:31] <axu> 4000 also goit to be a string but Integer.parse made it int again

[15:43:06] <benwilson512> when you say "make it a variable" what do you mean?
[15:43:29] <axu> sorry, that was unclear. i ll try again :)
[15:44:48] <benwilson512> a code snippet that shows an example of what works and what doesn't work might help, including relevant input / output values

[15:56:38] <Nicd> how are you calling your testdata function?
[15:57:29] <benwilson512> Nicd: if it's outputting ^F027 then the `c` variable is correct, since that's the correct ascii for the hex

[16:04:33] <axu> hehe :)
[16:04:34] <axu> ok
[16:04:58] <axu> i guess i got it. neew to type a bit. then im right back.
[16:11:30] <axu> ok, now it works with the hex string :) my fault, wrong string, should have been  \x06\x30\x33\x37 :)
[16:11:51] <benwilson512> that'll do it! :D
[16:11:56] <axu> but the integer make trouble :) must have f... something up again :)
[16:12:07] <benwilson512> what's up with the integer?
[16:13:16] <axu> ** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in Integer.count_digits/2    
[16:13:45] <axu> compiles, but on execution throwes an error in my face
[16:13:51] <benwilson512> are you passing in the string or the integer?
[16:14:00] <axu> both
[16:14:02] <benwilson512> ?
[16:14:08] <axu> D0tester.testdata("\x06\x30\x33\x37", 4000)
[16:14:17] <benwilson512> to the Integer.count_digits function
[16:14:30] <benwilson512> earlier you had "4000" are you using "4000" or 4000
[16:14:42] <axu> {iw, ""} = Integer.parse(w)
[16:15:10] <axu> D0tester.testdata("\x06\x30\x33\x37", "4000")
[16:15:12] <axu> hehe :)
[16:15:13] <axu> thanks
[16:15:16] <axu> \works
[16:15:27] <benwilson512> axu: yup, it's important to pay close attention to the types of values you have
[16:15:32] <benwilson512> IO.inspect is very useful for this
[16:15:45] <axu> yes, gets me all the time these times :)
[16:44:33] <axu> another thing. i could quite get going is an endless loop. i worked around it by defining an a big number and counting it down. what would the right way to do so look like?  here is my loop helper function:
[16:44:44] <axu> def read_data(n) do       
[16:44:44] <axu> D0logger.getdata()         
[16:44:44] <axu> read_data(n - 1)       
[16:44:44] <axu> end
[16:45:41] <Nicd> just call it without an argument?
[16:46:09] <axu> mhm :)
[16:47:30] <axu> D0logger.read_data(0) :) ok
[16:47:34] <axu> works :)
[16:47:53] <Nicd> or just `D0logger.read_data()` and have it call itself as `read_data()`
[16:48:05] <Nicd> if you don't need an argument, don't use one
[16:48:15] <axu> absolutly true
[16:50:28] <axu> fixed :)
[16:52:29] <axu> how complex would it be to implement this the pure elixir way. with genserver and stuff? and maybe a looger instead of manual filehandling. any example projects one can recommend to dive into this?
[16:53:15] <axu> an elixir datalogger.

[17:35:44] <mooff> does someone have an idea what this compilation issue between rebar3 and parse_trans might be? https://i.awful.cooking/94c03f87c926a9d0.png
[17:37:07] <mooff> happens with elixir 1.7.4 and 1.10.3, in Debian oldstable and stable, respectively
[17:41:00] <mooff> or alternatively - why --no-halt is not sufficient to keep a tcp port bound from an elixir script on 1.12 <3

[18:04:33] <josevalim> mooff: what is your erlang version?
[18:04:46] <josevalim> it is saying erl_syntax:type is not available, so there are two options:
[18:04:51] <josevalim> 1. you are using an old erlang
[18:05:08] <josevalim> 2. debian brakes erlang apart and you are missing the package that defines erl_syntax (most likely parser_tools)
[18:09:44] <mooff> ah, looks like it's erlang-parsetools
[18:11:06] <mooff> nein, unfortunately not
[18:11:28] <mooff> Erlang/OTP 21 [erts-10.2.4]
[18:13:07] <mooff> i'll complain on debian channels :) thanks josevalim
[18:13:31] <josevalim> mooff: did you fix it?
[18:14:11] <mooff> no. it compiles okay on 1.12.3 from Debian sid, but there we have the "unbinds the port at script end despite --no-halt" issue
[18:14:31] <mooff> ^ https://i.awful.cooking/652ea05f410f4e44.png
[18:21:14] <mooff> err... fixed it :-)
[18:21:24] <mooff> 'apt install erlang'...
[18:35:05] <val> mooff: wat
[18:42:39] <mooff> val: parse_trans wouldn't compile without the Debian 'erlang' package installed

[22:13:49] <mathsaey> Hey all, I'm trying to make sure I understood the following quote from Jose right: "A new ExDoc version was also just released with .livemd support in guides, which automatically adds the badge for you. This means you can write guides and documentation, publish them to Hex.pm, and users can click the badge to start playing with your library in an interactive environment."
[22:15:00] <mathsaey> Does this mean that if I publish a livemd file to hexdocs, it automatically adds a button that loads said page in a livebook so users can play around with it? Where does the livebook run? And does the livebook run in "mix" mode, so that all dependencies are available without the need to use Mix.install?
[22:16:45] <mathsaey> Mainly trying to figure out what kind of work is involved (besides writing the actual page) if I want to have such a page for my own project :).
