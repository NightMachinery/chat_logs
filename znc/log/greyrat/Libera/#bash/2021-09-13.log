[03:52:53] <xberry> hi, I cannot wrap my head around this, if I do `elif [[ "$MXCOUNT" >= "2" ]]` it shouts "syntax error near 2", and if I do `[ "$MXCOUNT" >= "2" ]` it screams "[: 3: unary operator expected". $MXCOUNT is an integer and I want to check if it is greater or equal to two. I also attempted `-eq` but it too shows a syntax error. I am using bash but would like to keep it portable (if possible). any input

[03:57:09] <emanuele6> xberry: in the first case, >= is not an operator supported by [[
[03:57:40] <emanuele6> in the second, that line is interpreted as `[ "$MYCOUNT" 2 ] > =' and $MYCOUNT was 3
[03:57:57] <emanuele6> so it tried to run [ 3 2 ] and 3 is not a valid unary operator
[03:58:29] <emanuele6> it probably also created a file named "=" when you run that command
[03:59:10] <xberry> hi emanuele6, thank you so much, and my apologies. I resolved it with `[ "$MXCOUNT" -gt "2" ]` which I dorkingly missed
[03:59:23] <xberry> so sorry for the waste of time
[03:59:30] <emanuele6> !test
[03:59:30] <greybot> Use [[ .. ]] for testing strings or files, (( .. )) for testing numbers, and ''if ..'' for testing commands. Do *NOT* use [ .. ] in bash (only in sh). See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/tests> and <http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/commands/classictest>. Difference between [ and [[: <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031>
[04:00:52] <xberry> thank you!
[04:00:53] <emanuele6> xberry: in bash, you can use [[ MXCOUNT -gt 2 ]], [ "$MXCOUNT" -gt 2 ] or (( MXCOUNT >= 2 )); the latter is prefered
[04:01:01] <xberry> ohh I guess if I try to keep it compatible with sh [ ] in bash is still fine though?
[04:01:26] <emanuele6> if you are targetting posix, you can only use [ "$MXCOUNT" -gt 2 ]
[04:01:41] <xberry> ok got it! thanks a lot

[04:02:48] <emanuele6> because they could have special meaning in the shell you are targetting
[04:03:08] <emanuele6> e.g. REPLY, MAPFILE etc have a special meaning in bash
[04:03:31] <xberry> ooh I did not know about that. that's good to know! I'll swap it out
[04:03:34] <xberry> thanks for the tip!!
[04:03:37] <emanuele6> unless MXCOUNT is an environment variable, you should call it mxcount
[04:03:47] <emanuele6> you are welcome
[04:04:03] <xberry> will do!

[04:37:01] <mrjpaxton[m]> Hey, simple question but I've been wondering for a while, when is it more appropriate to use ${var} over $var when using variables? Is it to use a variable in with strings better, like "${var}foobar", or something like that?
[04:37:29] <mrjpaxton[m]> I'm assuming that ${var} is also not equivalent to "$var".
[04:37:37] <emanuele6> it is not
[04:37:41] <mrjpaxton[m]> But I'm not sure.
[04:38:01] <emanuele6> unquoted ${var} is equivalent to unquoted $var
[04:39:14] <emanuele6> the main use of ${} is what you have shown in your example, but some people like to always use ${} for consistency

[16:51:07] <pj> ...which is why I referenced strftime(3), which also specifies the portability of the individual specifiers.
[16:51:56] <ormaaj> it's not very portable. Posix doesn't specify %T, only bash and ksh93 support it, and ksh93's implementation is much more powerful than bash's
[16:52:36] <ormaaj> if posix added it it would probably get a different letter to distinguish from %t
[16:52:45] <pj> ormaaj: bash doesn't "support" anything, all that bash does is pass the string onto the system's strftime()

[16:54:24] <ormaaj> kind of

[16:56:40] <emanuele6> oh you guys are talking about printf's %()T, not %T in strftime

[16:57:47] <pj> SU is "the Single UNIX Specification (marked SU)"

[17:05:00] <ormaaj> Ksh (at least versions that used to be part of AST) had libraries with extra features that are shared between the AST date (which can also be builtin), the shell's printf,  and it's C standard libraries. GNU duplicates that functionality with various omissions and incompatibilities between bash, coreutils, and glibc.
[17:07:26] <ormaaj> that's a pretty common theme. Same goes with things like the pattern matching code.

[22:05:22] <LuksNuke> given x=abbc i want to just remove b so i gets abc
[22:05:33] <LuksNuke> the last one
[22:05:36] <greycat> that's not the last character
[22:05:40] *** Joins: shokohsc8 (~shokohsc@161.88.195.77.rev.sfr.net)
[22:05:48] <LuksNuke> it's the last occurring 'b' character
[22:05:55] <greycat> but why did you choose 'b'?
[22:06:02] <greycat> why not remove the last 'a' or the last 'c'?
[22:06:05] <LuksNuke> it could be any character
[22:06:12] <greycat> then you could give any answer
[22:06:22] <LuksNuke> ...

[22:06:48] <eblip> hey the last occuring character is c ..leaving you with abb
[22:07:07] <greycat> I'm starting to suspect there are *two* inputs, and this wasn't mentioned.
[22:07:23] <LuksNuke> x="abbcbbcbbcbx" -- i want to remove just the last b.
[22:07:28] <LuksNuke> i know it's 'b'
[22:07:32] <greycat> because 'b' is a second input?
[22:07:32] <LuksNuke> so just remove the last 'b'
[22:07:41] <LuksNuke> it could be x.
[22:07:51] <LuksNuke> x="axxcxxcxxcxy"
[22:07:53] <greycat> So you have two inputs -- a string and a character?
