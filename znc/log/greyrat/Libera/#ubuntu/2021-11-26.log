Why couldn't i find hexchat in the ubuntu software centre. i had to run "sudo apt install hexchat"? i did search "software" and then enter and enable the "multiverse" as a source and in the past this has been enough to make it show up when searched for in the software centre (GUI)

If it were a CentOS box I could run createrepo_c after the RPMs complete dowloading but there is no such thing in Ubuntu... I've seen some attempts to port the tool to Ubuntu but I cannot even compile it from source or install it from a DEB due to some missing libs ...  has anyone here tacked this issue before? Thanks !

[14:44:12] <ubottu> Bug 1940707 in firefox (Ubuntu) "[upstream] Maximized window becomes a mess at next startup after manually choosing to restore previous session" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1940707
[14:45:30] <KBar> I, too, encounter a similar problem very often.
[14:45:41] <KBar> I couldn't find a way to fix it, though.
[14:45:46] <KBar> Very annoying indeed.

[15:44:27] <varaindemian> should I upgrade?

[15:45:57] <KBar> So yes, you should update.
[15:46:09] <lotuspsychje> always up to date indeed
[15:46:12] <KBar> 18.04.1 to 18.04.2 is just an update, not an upgrade.
[15:46:19] <lotuspsychje> !uptodate
[15:46:19] <ubottu> To ensure you have all the latest known patches and security updates for your ubuntu installation, please update with the following command: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`. See also !upgrades and !security; you may also need to run `apt full-upgrade`.
[15:46:31] <KBar> 18.04 to 20.04 would be an upgrade.

[15:51:52] <KBar> varaindemian, say you have firefox and thunderbird at version 45.1 when ubuntu 21.11 is released. after three months, there are some updates to some packages, and now firefox and thunderbird are at version 46. 21.11.1 would include all of the updates, so fresh installations don't miss out on them and don't have to download everything. It's already in.
[15:52:35] <KBar> varaindemian, if you were on 21.11 and to install all of the updates, your system would automatically bump up to 22.11.1

[16:01:49] <KBar> varaindemian, if you installed 18.04 right in the beginning and kept updating every day. You wouldn't notice a difference up until today.
[16:01:56] <varaindemian> KBar: do you have a link where this is exmplained?
[16:02:01] <KBar> varaindemian but your version would say 18.04.5/6/7
[16:02:20] <varaindemian> so the user with 18.04.2 did not issue the upgrade command
[16:03:02] <varaindemian> if you issue only update your system will get the 18.04.5 version?

[16:05:02] <KBar> varaindemian, I just gave two links. Point releases are updates, not upgrades. Depends on the initial state of your system.
[16:05:50] <varaindemian> KBar: so you still get security updates by issuing update without upgrade
[16:06:24] <KBar> varaindemian, 1) you can keep gradually updating and reaching 18.04.whatever 2) you can never update and update all at once today and reach 18.04.whatever 3) you can grab an up-to-date ISO and reinstall with all updates already baked in and your system will be 18.04.whatever

It says that you have to send multiple replies. Does it concatenate the content of each reply in one and send it back to us. Or really build differents replies and send them individually ?

[21:05:02] <TJ-> ens2: and you see Windows entry too?

[21:06:01] *** Quits: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:06:52] <TJ-> ens2: if you want to boot into Windows next time only, you can do "sudo efibootmgr --boot-next XXXX" where XXXX is the Windows boot order number (e.g. 0002) that avoids needing to press the firmware hotkey and select Windows from the manual boot menu
[21:07:13] <ens2> oh that's handy. i'll save that in a .sh
[21:07:59] <TJ-> ens2: efibootmgr can also be used to change the default, by setting an explicit permanent BootOrder. See "man efibotomgr" -- lots of good examples at the end
[21:08:03] <tomreyn> TJ-: just for me to understand: why are you saying grub should not be involved here? i mean sure, it is not needed, but it could be, or not?
[21:08:48] <tomreyn> i mean it could be used in addition to the uefi boot chooser
[21:08:54] <TJ-> tomreyn: the whole problem with trying to chainload another EFI portable executable, which is what os-prober tries to do
[21:09:11] <p13> well if you REALLY want to live on the edge, some google guys kexec'd into windows from linux lol
