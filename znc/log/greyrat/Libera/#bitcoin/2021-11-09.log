[00:00:27] <AndyS2_> not using an output for the change would mean donating all excess coins to the miners, and I don't think anybody wants that ;)

[00:01:08] <AndyS2_> imagine having a single UTXO with 0.1 bitcoin, you want to pay someone 0.001 bitcoin, and you losing 0.099 bitcoin because you didn't want a change output ;)

[00:04:24] <AndyS2_> lots of people do it. but lots of people have lost bitcoin, too, so maybe going with the majority isn't the most sensible thing with bitcoin (not that you'd immediately lose coins by address reuse, the problems with it are a little more complicated IMO)

They also tried to
[00:53:54] <jackass> spread PROPAGANDA on Wikipedia which was quickly found out by Wikipedia admins. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Jhanisse_V._Daza on wikipedia they wanted to create an article to Jhannise Vaca Daza days after that HRF called the Bolivian military to MURDER protesters (the press article still available on they website)

[00:53:55] <jackass> United States of America. Fraudulent trademark registration is punishable with 5 years of imprisonment, they give up trolling me with the trademark in 2019 when they changed they logo from the blue flame symbol to this shit what they have now, the same time they spent hundreds of thousands on propaganda that they accepting Bitcoin since 2013, then
[00:53:56] <jackass> they changed to 2014 but nowhere you see a single donation to this motherfuckers not even in 2015, You know why? Because I WAS WHO STARTED ACCEPTING BITCOIN FOR MY ORGANIZATION and these motherfuckers because failed to troll me with trademarks started going after our finances! Criminal neo-nazi pigs laundering money and even publicly lying about
[00:53:56] <jackass> Bitcoin, they even founded WITH BELCHER the so called "Bitcoin Developer Found" which is an INTERMEDIARY used to scam people!

[15:02:21] <Guest8373> I still think the max block size should be higher.
[15:02:48] <Guest8373> Considering how cheap storage space is now, and how common gigabit internet is becoming.
[15:03:38] *** Joins: shokohsc8 (~shokohsc@17.245.204.77.rev.sfr.net)
[15:03:48] <gribble> blocks aren't even full
[15:04:21] <Guest8373> Yes I know, that's good and all, but as soon as more users join the network they will be.
[15:05:03] <gribble> second layer works
[15:05:24] <Guest8373> It costs $130 to open a lightning network channel on electrum now.
[15:05:36] <belcher> you need to turn the fee rate slider all the way down
[15:05:39] <gribble> you're doing something very wrong then
[15:05:43] <belcher> make it 1 sat/vbyte
[15:05:51] <gribble> ^^this
[15:06:31] <belcher> the biggest bottleneck with larger blocks is the time required for initial sync, and cheaper storage space / faster internet dont solve that much
[15:06:47] <Guest8373> Fees aren't the problem, electrum has a 200000 satoshi minimum for opening a channel.
[15:07:30] <Guest8373> Why wouldn't faster internet help with initial sync times?
[15:07:43] <kinlo> see the problem with the block size is that whatever size we will choose, it will be both a) too small to fit all transactions and b) too large to get all the advantages we want
[15:07:46] <belcher> the biggest bottleneck is usually the cpu and disk io
[15:07:59] *** belcher sets mode: -o belcher
[15:08:20] <Guest8373> Okay I have a 6 year old laptop and it seems to be syncing okay.
[15:09:00] <kinlo> Guest8373: for now, but what if we increase the block size?  And what if bitcoin is 10 years older and the data on disk has more then doubled?
[15:09:22] <kinlo> do we want bitcoin to be so resource heavy only a few can afford the hardware to run it?
[15:09:57] <Guest8373> kinlo No I'm aware that it's a tricky balance to find.
[15:11:56] <Guest8373> But a 2 TB SSD now costs around $230
[15:13:41] <paairs> double blocksize means also double time for cpu time (at least)
[15:13:41] <kinlo> the problem is the entire bitcoin world needs to agree on the blocksize
[15:13:57] <belcher> Guest8373 how long did it take for your 6 year old laptop to finish syncing
[15:14:13] <kinlo> and this is one of the things that is in reality not a problem
[15:14:25] <kinlo> and a typical "color of the bikeshed" problem
[15:14:31] <Guest8373> belcher really good question, actually not done yet, takes a few days, but I'm willing to let it sync.
[15:14:43] <kinlo> you should always avoid color of the bikeshed problems
[15:15:25] <belcher> you know you can also enable pruning which reduces the disk space requirement by a lot, disk space is already not a problem
[15:16:07] <Guest8373> belcher in that case why not increase the block size a little bit?
[15:16:33] <belcher> because there are other far more serious problems than disk spac
[15:16:35] <belcher> e
[15:17:06] <kinlo> Guest8373: again, it's a consensus parameter - the entire bitcoin world needs to agree, it is a hard fork
[15:17:19] <kinlo> you can make it smaller, that would be a soft fork
[15:17:25] <kinlo> making it bigger is a hard fork
[15:18:27] <Guest8373> kinlo yeah I'm just trying to maybe make people open minded to the idea. I'm definetely not a fan of bitcoin sv or even bitcoin cash.
[15:18:47] <Guest8373> I think it could be done in a smart way, especially if bitcoin.org and bitcoin core were supporting it.
[15:19:33] <kinlo> the cool way to solve this problem would be to make sure that 2nd layers are such a success that we don't have to increase it in the first place
[15:19:52] <Guest8373> kinlo I'm open to that as well
[15:20:16] <Guest8373> But the literature is saying I can't safely store bitcoin on LN
[15:20:21] <AndyS2_> I think such support requires most people to see that all other reasonable avenues of increasing tx/s have been tried/implemented, AND that an increase is still required
[15:20:22] <Guest8373> long term
[15:20:32] <belcher> you can you just need a watchtower
[15:20:35] *** Quits: dna44 (~dna@47-220-190-100.gtwncmkt04.res.dyn.suddenlink.net) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[15:21:04] <belcher> and if you're doing long term storage you can splice out of a channel with 1 sat/b and be ready to wait ages for it to confirm
[15:21:09] <AndyS2_> Guest8373: totally wrong. if you never spend coins from your channel side, there are no old transactions to steal them from you, even if there are no watchtowers ;)
[15:21:12] <belcher> not a problem really
[15:21:16] <Guest8373> belcher okay I'll look into that
[15:21:42] <AndyS2_> Guest8373: so there's at least one way to safely store bitcoin on LN. not that it matters much
[15:22:46] <Guest8373> I guess my main concern at this point is the 200000 satoshi cost of opening a channel. Some people might get scared away by that.
[15:23:01] <belcher> how much is that in say USD?
[15:23:19] <Guest8373> $130
[15:23:20] <AndyS2_> If people were to increase the block size before the usage is high and before all other reasonable scaling solutions are implemented, that'd just incentivice people to keep their bad code/not invest in improving their software. Luckily it's not 2018 anymore where many exchanges weren't even batching
[15:23:31] <belcher> ideally people who have such small amounts wouldve recieved it over LN to start with
[15:23:42] <belcher> eg those bitcoin faucet sites pay out in LN rather than on-chain
[15:24:03] <Guest8373> belcher, in order to receive I have to open a channel, no?
[15:24:05] <AndyS2_> belcher: with a custodial ln wallet? or how'd they receive it?
[15:24:15] <belcher> i dont know
[15:25:07] <AndyS2_> I guess one could implement a faucet that batches ln channel creation and achieves a big fee reduction. but that might result in ln channels that can't be closed if fees rise?

[15:26:58] <Guest8373> I mean some banks have $2000 minimum deposits to avoid fees, so $130 isnt that bad, but still, there is potentially some room for improvement.
[15:28:07] <Victorsueca> Guest8373: Current fees are arround 1-2 sat per vB and a standard transaction takes up about 191 vB of space, which means that unless that you had a sh** ton of unconsolidated inputs, you've clearly overpaid fees
[15:28:15] <darosior> AndyS2_: fwiw another point similar to your argument above is that if you only ever spend from your channel you don't need to watch it (every previous state gives you more money than you currently really have). Also true if your outgoing capacity is at an all-time low.
[15:28:16] <AndyS2_> Guest8373: nah, that $130 minimum is stupid IMO

[15:36:39] <dag> I never sent btc. How many USD is a transaction fee right now?
[15:37:07] <belcher> depends on many things
[15:37:40] <belcher> you could get on-chain transactions confirmed for 1-2 sat/b which is very low, so thats less than a few cents for typical transactions
[15:37:59] <dag> e.g. lets say u buy a domain name from a registrar that accepts btc. how much can i expect the fee to be?
[15:38:56] <belcher> id estimate $0.5 to $1 in most cases
[15:38:56] <buZz> the fee isnt a thing , you can configure the fee on your own end for -every- transaction
[15:39:09] <paairs> btw: how on earth this site calculates fees this bad? https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/
[15:39:14] <buZz> https://mempool.space/ is nice imho

[15:40:09] <paairs> i check my fees from https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/

[15:42:37] <Victorsueca> I do the same as paairs, the graph may be hard to read if you're not used to it, but I always get the best fee estimates by looking at the graph on https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,24h,weight and making an aproximate guess.

[18:50:32] <Guest61> Kong, Taiwan, Belarus, Cuba. You call the Norwegian secret service, we will begin murdering people in Oslo as long Oslo working with Thor Halvorssen Mendoza the Venezuelan terrorists. His father worked for the DEA and the CIA and we will make sure everyone who in any way associated with the Human Rights Foundation going to get murdered, whatever
