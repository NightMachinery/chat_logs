[08:33:56] <PMT> (though i think it'll still try to hit up the normal debian-security repo if you do that)
[08:34:36] <themill> I also don't know of anyone starting with the installer for reproducible work.
[08:34:57] <PMT> in the curses installer, I'd look at console 4. I presume there's a logfile somewhere you can sniff in the graphical installer for equivalent data.

[09:38:58] <johnjay> ok. i wanted to do post install things like enable sudo
[09:40:05] <PMT> if you didn't explicitly set a root password in the installer, it installs sudo. if you did, it does not.

[12:15:47] <PMT> In that case, I am _guessing_ what happened is that they logged in, the bot which tracks ban expiration noticed they matched a ban in its records that wasn't present in the channel, and went "welp, time to fix that." Why they were banned in the first place is an open question without more information.

[15:17:01] <PerfDave> Not necessarily. If your "dumb" network of Gigabit switches + clients is physically separate from the stuff you're doing with SANs, just connect the whole shebang into an access port on the managed switch, and get it VLAN tagged that way. The clients don't need to do anything special.

[15:21:37] <naptastic> so, this segues into my next question... my DHCP server (remember I've never done VLANs before) should sit on all the networks, right?
[15:22:02] <PerfDave> Your DHCP server should have an interface on all the networks you want to serve DHCP to, yes.
[15:22:16] <PerfDave> And that's not really any different from non-VLAN interfaces

[15:23:27] <PerfDave> If your DHCP server had two physical interfaces, one on the client network and one on an admin network, you'd have it listen on e.g. eth0 and eth1. If the DHCP server is on two VLANs, one for clients and one for admin, it'll listen on e.g. eth0.10 and eth0.20 where 10 and 20 are the VLAN IDs.

[15:32:56] <PerfDave> naptastic: If you make it an access port (terminology may vary depending on switch vendor), then untagged traffic from your "dumb" network will be tagged onto VLAN 10 when it reaches the switch, and other traffic for VLAN 10 will be able to reach the "dumb" network.
[15:33:31] *** Joins: dvs (~hibbard@2607:f2c0:950b:5b00:e6a7:a0ff:fe31:ddf0)
[15:33:33] <naptastic> PerfDave, ok, that answers exactly my question. I will dig into Ubiquiti's docs and try to find out what that option is.
[15:35:17] <PerfDave> At work, I have a load of HP 48-port switches "stacked" together so they appear as one logical switch, and those are connected to the structured cabling that go to every desk pod. Each desk pod has 8 ports. They're all configured as access ports, usually on the "main" or "guest" networks, occasionally the voip phone network.
[15:35:42] <PerfDave> Nothing on a desk needs to be VLAN-aware, and the switches keep the traffic from those different networks segregated.
[15:36:53] <PerfDave> Only things that need to be on multiple VLANs need to be VLAN-aware really, like the firewalls - there's a 10GbE connection from the distribution switches to the main firewall, which has interfaces on all those networks as well as the Internet, and handles access control and routing between networks.
[15:36:59] <naptastic> PerfDave, so you just have to make sure the PCs don't use the phone ports or vice-versa?
[15:37:21] <PerfDave> naptastic: Yeah. And there are ways to do that more automatically, assigning VLANs based on MAC address or 802.1x authentication, but that's overkill for most setups.
[15:37:52] <naptastic> yeah, if I hadn't been an idiot, I'dve gotten a switch with 10gig uplinks. LPT: Don't get bipolar disorder.
[15:37:59] <PerfDave> (I'm simplifying for explanation purposes; we have a lot more failover and redundancy IRL)
[15:38:33] <PerfDave> naptastic: You may not need them, depends how much traffic you expect to throw over one link. And you can always bond interfaces together, so you can turn 2x 1GbE cables into a virtual 2GbE cable :)
[15:39:02] <naptastic> PerfDave, yeah, I've worked in an environment like that and I drove the sysops crazy with requests for perfectly logical options, like "please can I have the same IP address assigned to these eight MAC addresses"
[15:39:11] <naptastic> "That won't work!"
[15:39:15] <naptastic> "I'm running Linux. It's fine."
[15:39:57] <PerfDave> That may well break other things trying to talk to you though :)
[15:40:03] <naptastic> PerfDave, I learned a few weeks ago that bonding + ATAoE = kernel panic. :)
[15:41:24] <PerfDave> There was a Debian 9 point release which introduced a kernel update which screwed macvtap bridging. Given that we run infra by having libvirt hosts with VLAN interfaces bridging to VMs which aren't VLAN-aware, this utterly screwed our infra.
[15:41:29] <naptastic> nah, the ports on my desktop would just go into blocking mode until I made one of them fail. "Multipath" on Ethernet is a piece of cake. Just turn on STP, connect things sensibly, and call it a day.
[15:42:57] <naptastic> PerfDave, I use /etc/network/interfaces to make my bridges. Am I using macvtap bridges? (though I realize maybe it doesn't matter now)

[15:44:50] <PerfDave> naptastic: We'd have on the host an interface like enp0s0.100 for VLAN 100, and we'd tell libvirt that eth0 in the VM is bridged to that, so the VM would only see VLAN 100 traffic. The way libvirt did that bridging was using macvtap.
[15:47:21] <PerfDave> So when it broke all our infrastructure VMs couldn't talk to the rest of the network.

[15:50:08] <PerfDave> But I am a bear of little brain
[15:50:20] <naptastic> PerfDave, so what you're saying is "have three hypervisors so you can test kernels before committing to the upgrade"? :)
[15:50:32] <PerfDave> naptastic: In an ideal world that would be lovely.
[15:50:40] <PerfDave> I'd like some live migration too
[15:51:35] <naptastic> same
[15:51:58] <naptastic> though I think the only real answer there is infiniband, and I don't know that code's been written (or open-sourced)
[15:52:40] <jelly> what is unreal about fc san
[15:53:03] <PerfDave> Nah, it's easy enough to do - you can use a back-end like Ceph, glusterfs etc. to have redundant networked storage that can act as a backend to libvirt, openstack etc.
[15:53:15] <PerfDave> You just need time, skills and budget that the team I manage doesn't have :/
[15:53:21] <naptastic> but 40gig IB hardware is... well, it's not as cheap as FC gear, but you can get a 40gig p2p Infiniband link for under 150 USD

[15:54:16] <naptastic> jelly, tbh, mostly it's the price. I got dual-port 8-gig adapters, transceivers included, for $9 each. They run on OM3/LC which is dirt cheap.

[15:54:49] <jelly> 10/25G ethernet is also not too pricy
[15:55:09] <naptastic> ...until you need a switch...
[15:55:30] <jelly> use the same LC-LC MM cables as for 8/16/32G
[15:56:11] <jelly> and "unofficial" SFP+ / SFP28 modules
[15:56:22] <naptastic> jelly, same cables yes. Same transceivers, no, and Ethernet transceivers are much more expensive for the same bandwidth.
[15:56:35] <jelly> not really
[15:56:43] <PerfDave> I've got the Ubiquiti 12-port 10GbE SFP+ switch on my networks. Does what I need it to.
[15:57:09] <naptastic> PerfDave, is that managed?
[15:57:28] <PerfDave> It runs EdgeOS, same as most of the Ubiquiti managed stuff.
[15:57:52] <PerfDave> So yeah, it does VLANs, bonding, all the usual managed switch jazz
[15:57:57] <PerfDave> Not as easy to control with ansible as I'd like.
[15:58:55] <naptastic> I think OpenVswitch will talk natively to Ubiquiti gear; don't quote me on that, and don't inflict OVS on yourself if you can avoid it.

[16:41:03] <malmalmal> Hello I am using Kali, which is debian based, I have what seems a graphic card problem that results in xorg not starting. This is an old eepc with a "VGA compatible controller: Intel corporation Atom Processor D4xx/D5xx/N4xx/N5xx Integrated Graphics Controller" is there usually the need to install a specific graphic driver ?

[21:24:33] <johnjay> Khepra: dumb question but why do directories have to have +x permission
[21:24:52] <johnjay> it's like they need rwx or something to run program inside it?
[21:26:20] <randall> johnjay: "X" permissions on directories allow you to enter it. "r" permission let you read the contents, too.
[21:26:21] <jmd> johnjay: They don't have to.  Only if you want to list the contents.
[21:26:48] <johnjay> so i need r or rx to list contents?
[21:26:58] <johnjay> i suppose w is to delete it

[23:23:09] <somiaj> zzo38: so gcc won't build your program? Yes if you require a complier (that is in debian) that is not part of build-essential, that needs to be included in your build-depends, and your debian/rules and make process needs to correctly use that complier

[23:24:24] <zzo38> GCC does build the program. Other compilers I am not sure (Clang might work too, but I have not tested). Does Debian always use GCC? If so, then it is not a problem
[23:24:27] <somiaj> for instance if you do need clang, this isn't part of build-essential so you would include it and any other packages you need as part of your build depends.

[23:56:22] <somiaj> you can read that policy document, but I would just report the main upstream one (or the main one that debian package is built from)
[23:56:33] <somiaj> I don't think multiple ones would be useful
[23:58:25] <zzo38> In the case of Free Hero Mesh, the main one doesn't have TLS, although the mirror does have optional TLS. The mirror is not updated as frequently, but when it is, it has all of the same files as the main one. For released versions though, it will always match the main one, so things such as Debian could use either one.
