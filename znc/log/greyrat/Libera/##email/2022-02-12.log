[08:17:41] <kj7rrv> I have an email server set up with iredmail. I get spam very rarely (about one message every six months), so I'm thinking about disabling SpamAssassin to reduce server load. Is that a good idea?
[08:17:59] <kj7rrv> My server often runs low on ram
[08:18:09] <kj7rrv> (adding more isn't an option)
[08:19:31] <Friithian> how much spam is it blocking?
[08:20:56] <kj7rrv> Oh, does some spam not even reach the spam inbox?
[08:21:57] <kj7rrv> The two spam emails I've seen in a year both went to my junk mail box
[08:28:01] <kj7rrv> Would there be a log somewhere?
[08:34:56] <pj> kj7rrv: if you feel that the rest of your anti-spam solutions are working well enough for you then there's nothing wrong with disabling SA.  At the end of the day it's a matter of what works best for you.
[08:35:18] <pj> ...and, well, if you start getting heaps of spam you can always turn it back on again.
[08:36:28] <pj> also, assuming that you've configured postfix, then postscreen, when properly configured, can so quite a bit towards preventing spam and is very light weight.
[08:36:36] <pj> *do
[08:38:09] <kj7rrv> Okay. What would happen if I disabled all spam filtering?
[08:38:27] <jaybe> you would receive mail that may have been blocked by said filtering
[08:38:41] <kj7rrv> Okay. 
[08:39:00] <jaybe> s/would/may/g
[08:39:02] <kj7rrv> Do all spam emails go to the junk folder, or do some get completely blocked?
[08:39:23] <kj7rrv> I get basically zero spam in my junk folder
[08:39:41] <kj7rrv> And none at all in the regular inbox
[08:42:18] <pj> kj7rrv: it depends on how you have your anti-spam configured.
[08:42:50] <pj> you should be able to tell by looking at your server logs.
[08:43:30] <kj7rrv> Okay
[08:43:41] <kj7rrv> I just disabled SpamAssassin; I'll see what happens
[08:43:56] <kj7rrv> The worst case scenario is that I wake up with an inbox full of spam, right?
[08:52:48] <pj> yeah, pretty much.
[08:53:21] <pj> well, the worst case is that you didn't disable it properly and no mail will go through
[08:53:27] <kj7rrv> Okay
[08:53:31] <pj> but that's easy enough to test, just send yourself an email.
[08:53:35] <kj7rrv> I sent myself an email from Gmail, and it worked
[08:53:40] <pj> cool
[08:53:59] <kj7rrv> I just did systemctl disable SpamAssassin
[08:54:05] <pj> okay
[08:54:08] <kj7rrv> Without the caps; autocorrect did that
[08:54:16] <pj> hehehe
[08:54:24] <pj> oh
[08:54:31] <pj> that will not turn off SA, though
[08:54:39] <pj> you disabled it from starting at boot
[08:54:49] <kj7rrv> s/disable/stop
[08:54:58] <pj> yeah, you need stop as well.
[08:55:13] <kj7rrv> I mistyped it in the chat; I did both on the server
[08:55:18] <pj> okay
[08:56:27] <kj7rrv> No spam so far
[08:56:35] <pj> hahaha, okay
[08:57:31] <kj7rrv> And I just got a real non-test email, and it worked fine
[08:57:38] <pj> oh, I should mention something, if you had SA configured to check outbound mail as well then you obviously loose that protection.
[08:58:10] <kj7rrv> What protection would that provide?
[08:58:44] <pj> If, for example, someone got your email credentials and was trying to use your server to send spam, then SA might block some or all of it.
[08:58:54] <kj7rrv> Oh okay.
[08:59:13] <kj7rrv> I have network SMTP and IMAP disabled, and only use webmail
[08:59:43] <kj7rrv> Would that help?
[08:59:55] <pj> it would help just as much with webmail as with smtp / imap access.
[09:00:10] <kj7rrv> Okay
[09:00:37] <kj7rrv> I meant would disabling SMTP/IMAP reduce the change of someone compromising my account and sending spam?
[09:00:43] <pj> If someone got your credentials they could have a bot use your webmail form to send spam, or if there were a vulnerability they were exploiting in the webmail client itself, for example.
[09:00:50] <kj7rrv> Oh okay.
[09:00:51] <pj> yes, it would, but not eleiminate it.

[09:01:31] <pj> It's like closing the door but leaving the window open.

[09:02:31] *** Joins: dob1 (~dob1@user/dob1)
[09:02:38] <kj7rrv> Okay. I think sogo has 2fa; if I turn that on, it would basically eliminate the problem (unless sogo was vulnerable), right?
[09:02:43] <pj> I wouldn't worry too much about it, I'm just telling you so you're fully informed.  I probably make it sound worse than it is.
[09:04:14] <pj> At the end of the day, the best things you can do are basic end-user type security stuff, have a good password on the account that can't be easily brute-forced, and make sure to keep your software updated so if any vulnerabilities are patched you get those fixes ASAP.
[09:04:20] <kj7rrv> Okay. My server had very little free memory before, and it has quite a bit now, so I'm willing to accept the risk. It was pretty slow.
[09:04:29] <pj> right
[09:04:31] <kj7rrv> Yeah I do all of that
[09:05:47] <pj> and sure, if you want to use 2fa, that can't hurt either.
[09:06:44] <pj> At the end of the day it's all a trade off.  Disabling SA is a trade off, you loose some anti-spam capabilities, but you gain the server resources, and in your case it's worth it for the gain in server resources.
[09:07:49] <kj7rrv> Okay. I wasn't worried too much about performance when it was just my email and basically non-existent Web site, but now I'm hosting a Gitea instance and a ham radio club wiki as well, so performance is an issue now

[17:15:03] <personx_> could someone suggest some good looking webmail interfaces with similar look and feel as gmail or outlook? [can be premium/free both].
[17:20:06] <rob0> I don't use gmail, and I don't like Outlook Web App.  My main MUA for personal use is roundcube.
[17:21:19] <personx_> I personally use roundcude too. But I have to provide a webmail client with a feel similar to gmail [that my office people] have been using since I'm pushing for a shift from google mail hosting to our own vps.
[17:57:02] <personx_> what are some good mail servers that allow easy overviewing of all mailboxes for admin, and setting up custom restrictions like not letting users being able to delete emails from their inbox or some sort of automated backup of all emails that can be restored/retrived?
[18:09:12] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@2806:101e:7:5da4:cce5:129b:c2cd:8f44)
[19:07:18] <rob0> If I was going to do a backup thing like that, I'd do it in the MTA, with a PCRE map to BCC all recipients somewhere.  Then you can retrieve anything your user deleted, while browbeating hin/her for being silly. :)
[19:08:25] <rob0> Dovecot has a "master user" feature, but I don't use that, not appropriate for my use case.
[19:13:00] <kj7rrv> personx_: I would recommend sogo for the webmail
[19:13:30] <kj7rrv> It is fairly similar to gmajl
[19:13:40] <kj7rrv> It also provides calendar and contacts
[19:16:06] <personx_> kj7rrv, lemme check it out
[19:17:36] <rob0> I think they all have some means of contacts, but not many do CalDAV.
[19:19:13] <rob0> There are a couple of commercial systems based on free software you might also want to look at: OpenXchange and Zimbra.
[19:19:53] <rob0> I'm pissed at OX because they blew me off for a couple job applications I was well qualified for. :)
[19:20:09] <personx_> rob0, zimbra didn't feel very similar to gmail. i'll check openxchange as well
[19:20:22] <rob0> Zimbra, I have used as a user, and yes, I'd say it is Outlook-like.
[19:21:15] <rob0> I think the job I got was better in many ways than the OX job anyway, so meh.
[19:21:56] <personx_> rob0, hehe, glad things worked out. :) 
[19:22:03] <rob0> But if I had gotten past the HR moron to the tech people, I'd have been hired.

[19:42:28] <personx_> kj7rrv, man this really looks very good, thanks for the suggestion!
[19:43:17] <kj7rrv> You're welcome! I've been using it for almost a year
[19:43:56] <personx_> and which mailserver have you integrated this webmail interface to?
[19:44:52] <kj7rrv> I used iredmail to set it up; it uses postfix and dovecot
[19:46:09] <personx_> you sir, have been very very helpful. :)
[19:47:01] <personx_> okay so how is the email deliverability reliability of the setup you're using? were you able to setup all proper dns and certificates and ssl/tls stuff easily?
[19:50:01] <rob0> deliverability is a huge can of worms
[19:50:29] <rob0> (and not at all related to your MUA/webmail)
[19:50:40] <rob0> !deliverability
[19:50:41] <dig-dug> rob0: deliverability: (#1) If you're having problems getting your mail received by major ESPs you should first check your !fcrdns, then make sure you have SPF, DKIM and DMARC configured (see !easy_dmarc). Sign up for the dnswl at http://www.dnswl.org. Also sign up for ESP-specific programs such as feedback loops, Google postmaster tools and Microsoft's SNDS., or (#2) Check the individual postmaster pages for each ESP that
[19:50:42] <dig-dug> rob0: you're having problems with to make sure that you're in compliance with all of their policies and if you still have problems contact the support for the ESP., or (#3) Also check to make sure you're not on any DNSRBLs and submit removal requests from any you appear on. See !multirbl.
[19:51:20] <personx_> righttt, i understand. i'll do all of that.
[19:51:40] <kj7rrv> I've never had a deliverability issue
[19:51:58] <kj7rrv> I did all the DNS records
[19:52:00] <rob0> very rare for small operators
[19:52:39] <rob0> Most small sites will have problems with one or more big operations.
[19:53:59] <personx_> besides good email practice, [my office doesn't do any promotional campaigns or stuff like that], any other stuff i might want to keep in mind while setting things up?
[19:59:45] <rob0> heh.  Well, starting an email service is a huge chore.  Outsourcing usually makes the most sense, in economic terms.
[20:01:29] <rob0> Running your own only offers the warm fuzzies of knowing that you control all access to your mail.  Offer void where taxed or prohibited, or of course if you are using cloud-based services without disk encryption.
[20:02:01] <personx_> we've considered all the pricing and everything we're currently paying and moving from google's pricing system of per mailbox doesn't feel scalable anymore. it'd be cheaper to  run 2 vps.
[20:02:34] <rob0> yes, that's true, but that doesn't factor in the cost of the time you might have to invest
