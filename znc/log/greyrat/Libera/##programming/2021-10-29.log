[01:29:19] <Sqaure> Powerful in one way but clutters up the language to the point it gets really wierd and deadly bad.
[01:29:43] <diophantoz> do you have to use annotations like @Override tho?

[02:36:42] <CalimeroTeknik> do we have proof of that now?
[02:36:50] <flakland> their mentality is to sweep the reports under the mailing list rug, and pretend its not a problem
[02:37:00] <flakland> until someone abuses the vuln too far
[02:37:06] <CalimeroTeknik> that is confirmed, yes

[02:39:22] <flakland> reality: more spec patches incoming
[02:39:29] <Joanna> Does anyone think that there is a possibility that there is also trickery involved in inducing people to “upgrade “ their os to something that is actually less secure?
[02:40:16] <CalimeroTeknik> Joanna, as far as I could see, there is, but it's systemic and out of a debatable compromise everyone is aware of

[03:21:05] <InPhase> Thedarkb-Desktop: So I haven't studied them all, as there appear to be a lot of avenues in this direction now.  But for example, one approach relies on the ability to grab an offset for what to look up based on a value in memory one is not allowed to access.  This will obviously cause a segfault and crash the process.  But these techniques work by causing that to happen outside of the execution 
[03:21:11] <InPhase> pathway, which you can do by something like forking a child, having it do the access and crash, or by using branch misprediction so that the inaccessible address is brought into the cache but the segfault never happens because the instruction was never officially executed.
[03:21:49] <[itchyjunk]> I have a JPanel which implements mouse events, i want to know the x,y position of whereever i click
[03:21:58] <InPhase> Thedarkb-Desktop: Since you can choose which region of memory to access based on a value you're not allowed to access with these transient instructions, you can select an address within a portion of memory you ARE allowed to access, and then check to see whether it has suddenly become cached by a timing attack.
[03:22:10] <[itchyjunk]> i thought i would want mouseClicked(MouseEvent e), but now i am not sure.

[03:24:20] <Thedarkb-Desktop> InPhase, what throws me for a loop is what can you actually accomplish from this?
[03:24:23] <InPhase> flakland: The fatal flaw was that the vulnerable processors were fetching these disallowed regions during the pipeline execution even though the OS had marked them as inaccessible such that an exception should be thrown.
[03:24:31] <flakland> if the memory was mapped by user privileges then the code being executed should raise a fault
[03:26:15] <flakland> they werent disallowed from the CPU perspective
[03:26:22] <InPhase> Thedarkb-Desktop: Well for example, say you use a particular byte of inaccessible memory as an offset, and you add it to an offset such that if it's 127 or less you'll get the first chunk of memory cached, and if it's 128 or greater then you'll get the second chunk of memory cached.  By checking to see which chunk of memory has been cached, you now know the first bit of that byte.  Next time, shift 
[03:26:28] <InPhase> and repeat.
[03:26:33] <flakland> because linux maps the whole damn addr space
[03:26:50] <flakland> to each CPU
[03:27:06] <flakland> because it does that scheduling hopping so it can run any process on any CPU
[03:27:11] <InPhase> Thedarkb-Desktop: It seems painfully slow, but computers can run fast enough that the exploit can just sit there scanning through the memory bit by bit reading it all out.
[03:27:17] <Thedarkb-Desktop> Ah, that makes perfect sense.
[03:28:57] <InPhase> flakland: Were you not reading what I wrote?  The problem is the hardware cannot raise a fault for code which is not actually executed but only pre-executed by something like a mispredicted branch.

[03:30:07] <InPhase> flakland: So no fault can occur if it was never truly executed.  This is identical to how no fault happens if you check to see if a pointer is null, and if so, don't dereference it.  The cpu will actually attempt to dereference it sometimes from a branch prediction failure, but it cannot throw a segfault for that.

[04:00:30] <Guest80> the fact that software depends on the # of bits is the greatest flaw in software engineering. software should be written so its independent of such.

[04:01:43] <vdamewood> CPUs just happen to be designed to be able to support both (or in the case of amd64 all three) ISAs.
[04:01:47] <Guest80> vdamewood: I think the problem is arrays otherwise, different ISAs would be interchangeable almost

[04:11:24] <flakland> m1 lacks in perf, but is highly energy efficient
[04:11:32] <vdamewood> phogg: Yes.
[04:11:53] <vdamewood> flakland: Actually, it's pretty good in performance, though M1 Max and M1 Pro are better.
[04:12:06] <flakland> its ok until you compare to top of the line ryzens
[04:12:18] <flakland> where it gets steamrolled in multicore workloads
[04:12:32] <vdamewood> Also, Apple are transitioning entirely away from Intel, not just their laptops. It's just that their laptops have completed the transition.
[04:12:44] <phogg> Apple has a long history of changing to incompatible new architectures. It's easier today than ever.
[04:12:47] <LjL> well "it's okay" and "it's lacking" are kind of not quite compatible statements, are they? "it's lacking if you compare it to top things" doesn't say much except "it's not at the top"
[04:12:53] <leduyquang753> Apple compared M1 to an NVIDIA 3080 LUL.
[04:13:02] <flakland> they claim to be a hig h end brand
[04:13:07] <flakland> so its lacking high-end perf
[04:13:18] <flakland> but it has OK perf when comparing to mid-level HW
[04:13:26] <phogg> flakland: people who like Apple hardware aren't in it for the benchmarks
[04:13:58] <vdamewood> phogg: Interesting you say that. I remember noticing that Apple took 10 and 12 years to switch CPUs in the Macintosh line their first and second times. After 12 years of Intel, I started wondering when they were going to change again.
[04:14:15] <LjL> i think they're going to get faster the more they do it :)
[04:14:24] <leduyquang753> Well Apple fanboys just take whatever that seems to give their products an easier win.
[04:14:33] <phogg> vdamewood: itchy feet look for greener grass to walk on, I guess

[04:15:05] <phogg> vdamewood: I'm starting to think it's more of a power move to keep developers in line. If you work entirely within their ecosystem it's not a big deal.
[04:15:08] <vdamewood> phogg: Well, each time they switched there was a reason.

[08:30:57] <smallville7123> the main problem is most things just use a texture atlas which inflates memory usage with high pixel sizes, also glyphy seems to be able to scale the texture without actually resizing the texture itself and without loosing any quality https://imgur.com/a/rPUQKNW *

[08:48:35] <smallville7123> but unfortunately it uses legacy opengl :(      (GL 2.1) however does NOT use the fixed pipeline
[08:48:39] <flakland> oh the lib you want to use is legacy
[08:49:03] <smallville7123> yes
[08:49:18] <Decker> happy porting :)
[08:49:20] <flakland> surely there is a more modern l ibrary
[08:50:11] <flakland> just make your own
[08:50:39] <flakland> instead of a texture atlas of glyphs make an atlas of verts for triangle_strip
[08:53:56] <flakland> because that's the only way to scale without quality loss

[11:38:53] <flakland> yeah, you can disablethem though
[11:39:51] <mrig> xcb being a lib that makes a slightly different interface with the xserver protocol than xlib does.

[19:04:05] <DnzAtWrk> clever as in, holy shit the algo is 5 lines long

[20:09:50] <mrig> I think he uses the term compression because he has coded compression algorithms and understands them, and it is just a reference to extracting which parts of the program are targets for making into features, similar to a frequency analysis, and which are best ignored. Though it sounds that way it is not about writing the shortest code possible or overly condensing things.

[22:48:07] <pyzozord> lol, I actually find myself sometimes opening my terminal without an animated background

[22:54:16] <pyzozord> sometimes I opt out of this feature and just use plain old black background
[22:55:15] <apotheon> animated background

[22:59:42] <pyzozord> I have a makeshift system in bash that automatically loads .bashrc in the current directory, so whenever I enter project dir local bash commands are automatically available
[22:59:48] <ornxka> ive got one that does something like: you create a project, and then you switch to a subshell with some project-specific env vars set, like $HISTFILE, so all your bash history gets associated with that specific project
[22:59:48] <apotheon> err, the animated thing, I mean, not the scripts ornxka mentioned
[23:00:29] <ornxka> it also does a bunch of other stuff like create project-specific firefox profiles, skeleton directory structures, spins up a docker container for that project, etc
[23:00:39] <pyzozord> nice, I was thinking about the subshells too
[23:00:43] <ornxka> but im wondering if there is a more standardized and less ad-hoc way to do it
