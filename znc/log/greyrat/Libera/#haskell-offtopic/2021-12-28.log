[12:01:23] <tomsmeding> [exa]: good point about the french & german institutions, there's some good theoretical CS there
[12:02:38] <tomsmeding> re supervisor: indeed important for further career in academia, but in case you're less interested in the academic career, >50% of your time in a (Dutch) MSc is spent on courses, where there's no supervisor in sight. :)
[12:04:33] <tomsmeding> also agree with (4), losing a year can win you a lot more than that lost year
[12:04:55] <tomsmeding> turlando: ^
[12:16:09] <turlando> Thanks [exa] and tomsmeding again for the precious opinions. Starting from [exa]: 1. I'm not sure I want to do something in academia, but i don't even want to preclude that path. I totally agree that the supervisor choice is critical and while I've got a very informal proposal from my BSc's thesis supervisor for a PhD (after the MSc), his research field (that I find interesting nonetheless) is not so much related to what I'd like to master; the
[12:16:09] <turlando>  rest of the CS department from what I've seen is just chasing the hot things of the moment. 2. I agree it's for a large part a psychological thing, but for sure it doesn't make logistics easier. 3. I will also check french and german institutions, trying to filter based on the published papers. 4. I agree, but as I've already lost few years before my BSc I kinda feel some pressure because of my age. tomsmeding: >50% with no supervisor in sight
[12:16:09] <turlando>  is still <50% time for networking, right?
[12:17:30] <tomsmeding> turlando: you mean that <50% is still a lot of time? sure, true :)
[12:17:50] <tomsmeding> in fact it's 5 quarters of courses, and 3 quarters of master thesis in NL
[12:18:08] <tomsmeding> (well, no, that's in Utrecht. But other unis are somewhat similar)
[12:21:16] <turlando> Ah, didn't know that. So you're supposed to spend 3 quarters just (or also/mostly) on the thesis? That's a lot of time compared to the standards here
[12:23:38] <tomsmeding> in utrecht it is like that indeed. But check for the other unis. For utrecht the info is here, assuming you're familiar with ECTS https://students.uu.nl/en/science/computing-science/academics/study-programme/curriculum

[18:56:15] <Athas> tomsmeding: what!  Does Accelerate have any concurrency primitives?  Isn't it purely data parallelism?
[18:56:48] <tomsmeding> it is!
[18:57:03] <Athas> What kind of parallel C++ do they fit in a graphics course?  I'd love to put more graphics in my own teaching, but the main parallelism in graphics tends to be too trivial.
[18:57:05] <tomsmeding> not sure what the course looks like, it's probably both concurrency and parallelism
[18:58:08] <tomsmeding> re graphics course: only simple stuff. You get to write a parallel path tracer, either cpu or gpu (gpu is harder of course, so if you choose cpu you have to do some other stuff too)
[18:58:22] <tomsmeding> so, in all, probably not much interesting for you :)
[18:59:19] <tomsmeding> were you looking for inspiration for your own teaching?
[19:00:25] <Athas> Yes.  I'm curious how this stuff is taught elsewhere.
[19:01:13] <Athas> We have general unfocused concurrent programming in a systems course in the undergrad, and then two hardcore elective graduate courses on GPU programming/optimisation and high-level data parallel programming, respectively.
[19:01:25] <Athas> And I think the physics department has an HPC course of some kind.
[19:05:35] <tomsmeding> we have an elective "optimisation & vectorisation" course that goes into SIMD stuff and general C++ performance things, but doesn't really touch upon parallelisation as far as I can remember
[19:06:05] <tomsmeding> I'm not sure we have any actual focus on GPU programming anywhere, but I may be mistaken
[19:06:18] <tomsmeding> and not sure about other departments :)
[19:07:20] <Athas> I'm thinking about how to modernise teaching this material, in particular incorporating next-generation tools and languages.  It's easy to get stuck in a rut.
[19:09:25] <tomsmeding> concurrency seems relatively easy to get practical, well-known application areas for, given that "async/await" is a thing now in rust and JS, and perhaps others that I'm not aware of
