[00:35:48] <\f> rickame-: I guess it depends on the kind of content. If it really is an item in a bulleted list, then you can leave out the <p>. If it is more like a full paragraph though, it makes sense to wrap it in a <p>.
[00:35:49] <Ragnor> I'm not sure if I really understand that. But to check/see the certificate(s), you could do something like that: openssl s_client -connect www.oldcompanyname.com:443 -showcerts
[00:36:25] <\f> molt: probably best to ask that at #web or a JavaScript oriented channel.

[02:14:40] <rickame-> how do i can detect if i use a tag in wrong spot, like a tag that isn't phrasing content in a p tag that only lets phrasing content. tyvm!
[02:31:12] <\f> rickame-: you can try to validate it, but sometimes the error is not exactly what you would expect. This is one of those cases.
[02:31:17] <\f> https://validator.w3.org/nu/
[02:31:28] <\f> The link in the topic seems to not be loading.
[02:32:49] <\f> rickame-: In this case, if you say write `<p><section></section></p>`, the error will complain that it sees an ending `</p>` but not a `<p>` before it, which can be a bit confusing as you do have a `<p>` there.
[02:33:24] <rickame-> uh ya that's totally useless
[02:34:44] <\f> The reason for that is that HTML is actually quite permissive with its syntax (this is the subject of an entire book or more) so when it sees the `<section>` after a `<p>`, in order not to break things, it just presumes that you forgot or consciously did not include the ending `</p>` and _does that for you_.
[02:35:05] <\f> Knowing this you can watch out for that sort of error message :)
[02:35:50] <\f> This is why the validator sees the second `</p>` by itself and complains about it.

[02:41:23] <\f> So, yeah, not what you wanted. I guess MDN is your friend, so try to always look at the usage patterns for an element there. With time you will develop an intuition and be less dependent on a reference to do the right thing.
