[11:56:05] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> what does it even have to do with that
[11:56:08] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> you are locally hosting it
[11:56:19] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> just host it on 127.0.0.1:4040
[11:56:19] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i guess

[11:56:59] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> you can't access it from outside network
[11:57:02] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> if its locally hosted
[11:57:33] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> you can use ur public ip i guess

[11:57:49] <iamak[m]> I want to access from outside which is why I want to host it somewhere else

[12:19:23] <iamak[m]> gtlsgamr: Free? And it's private?
[12:19:39] <gtlsgamr> not sure what you mean by "private"
[12:19:52] <gtlsgamr> they are good people though. FOSS oriented
[12:19:57] <iamak[m]> Means my privacy will be protected?
[12:20:32] <gtlsgamr> sure I guess
[12:20:47] <iamak[m]> Hmm I'll check it in the evening then thanks!
[12:20:48] <gtlsgamr> it won;t be as secure as a private one
[12:20:54] <gtlsgamr> because they own the bouncer in the end
[12:21:03] <iamak[m]> Yeah that's true
[12:21:14] <gtlsgamr> but it is a good community like this one
[12:21:19] <gtlsgamr> you will get to learn a lot
