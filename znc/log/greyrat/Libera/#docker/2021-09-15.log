[16:38:24] <tabakhase> there is no way to remove a VOLUME line from a image no -- generally it just shouldnt matter to you that docker swatches in a annon-volume there... 
[16:39:01] <tabakhase> only somewhat-kinda-fix -> change the datadir the applkication uses (ive done that for a mysql image usecase for example)
[16:39:37] <bkhl> I guess it's a manageable problem, I'd just rather not have to deal with the pruning.
[16:39:45] <minimal> if the Dockerfile specified "VOLUME" then it will use them, whether or not you map them at container startup or not

[18:20:14] <orbi> on first run, everything works fine.  on second, i get a mysql error.  Im trying to start it to get to a bash prompt but i only can find info on attaching to a  running container using exec - is there a way to start bash when i start the container?
[18:20:28] <tabakhase> what error? :P
[18:20:44] <orbi> it gets to the cannot connect to mysql then aborts the startup
[18:21:03] <tabakhase> so how do you start it? got a compose to show of or so?

[18:26:22] <tabakhase> compose is certainly the "righter" thing here yea - think of it not a anything special rly, but just a "form to store those 2000 character long docker run commands" and keep things managable ;-)

[18:30:05] <orbi> alright confirmed the pw in mysql is right, as it is in the secrets file.  i need to start the icinga2 container, and figure out why it can't connect.
[18:30:22] <orbi> is there an easy command to see the internal ip of the running containers 
[18:30:30] <orbi> without entering them, i mean
[18:31:16] <tabakhase> "docker inspect THING" spits a lot, but ips also kinda should never ever matter to you in docker
[18:31:52] <orbi> they don't seem to be binding to 0.0.0.0.  i can get into the mysql by using mysql, with the internal ip of the mysql container
[18:32:16] <orbi> from the docker server, mysql -u root -p -h 172.18.0.2  works

[18:35:50] <orbi> so im not totally blank, but the videos didn't sink in - sorrry for stupid q's
[18:36:05] <orbi> this is probably something simple and obvious.
[18:37:03] <tabakhase> seems like youre just having a old password stuck somewhere maybe?
[18:37:21] <orbi> this is all brand spankin new
[18:37:35] <orbi> i made no changes
[18:37:39] <tabakhase> ((one other generic is that your app doesnt wait for mysl to be actually booted, but seeing "Pinging mysql:3306" looks like the container DOES check, so all fine there)
[18:38:39] <tabakhase> that hubpage talks about another "DEFAULT_MYSQL_PASS" var...
[18:38:47] <orbi> yeah and i have that set
[18:39:23] <orbi> hmm
[18:39:39] <orbi> let me make sure i didn't make a stupid mistake.. i only had 3h sleep
[18:40:56] <tabakhase> if you got nothing in there yet, kill it with fire (docker-compose down -v &  then manually delete the bind-mounts (volumes with path) contents as well i guess
[18:42:09] <tabakhase> (and obvs you need those set before the very first launch)
[18:43:24] <tabakhase> further... thats just using the latest mariadb image hm? - that expects MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD -- it can also create another user&pw with MYSQL_USER & MYSQL_PASSWORD -- but i guess here it looks as if icinga will create a user itself?
[18:43:39] <orbi> Rebuilding now.. there were multiple directories.
[18:44:01] <orbi> fuck same error.. i did the compose down -v and it said it removed everything...
[18:44:14] <orbi> pardon the profanity. unsure of if that's against the rules

[18:45:04] <tabakhase> "-v" still only removes in-docker-volumes, if you used the "- ./data/mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql" from that linked repo on the image (https://github.com/jjethwa/icinga2/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) its a "bind mount", you manually have to hosuekeep them

[18:56:39] <orbi> ooh that's what the other guy building this server before was trying
[18:56:48] <minimal> its a "pull" model - prometheus makes routine HTTP/HTTPS requests to "exporters" running on each machine
[18:56:53] <orbi> it apparently, also, didn't work.  
[18:57:45] <minimal> prometheus internally has its own binary storage format so no need for seperate database (though you can config it to use external stores)

[18:58:25] <minimal> a prometheus container should be fairly straightforward to get going - the real work is setting up various exporters on machines

[21:48:35] <ada_> greentree: I'm not saying its supposed to happen
[21:49:21] <ada_> greentree: just that the error message is self-explanatory.  do you have resources that are still being removed?  have you done anything to debug the situation? is it still a problem?
[21:50:25] *** Joins: sed (~sed@pool-100-7-38-116.rcmdva.fios.verizon.net)
[21:51:25] <greentree> there are a bunch of moving pieces. docker is being used in our CI builds w/ GH actions. i haven't inspected every single container running. all i know is someone set up a cronjob to reclaim resources by running prune commands daily
[21:51:53] <ada_> I would be more judicious about usine the prune commands
[21:52:13] <greentree> people started reporting that their builds were failing. ssh'ed into some machines and noticed disk space was close to full. ran `ps aux` and saw prune commands still in the process list dangling for over a day+
[21:52:14] <ada_> like, if all you really need to is clean up some exited containers, you can do that with a filter
[21:52:39] <ada_> if you need to remove old images, there's a filter for that too, and it avoids using prune
[21:53:40] <greentree> we were running `docker system prune -f --volumes` and `docker image prune -a -f --filter ="until 24h"`
[21:53:45] <greentree> is there an alternative for both of these?
[21:54:11] <ada_> well, system prune is going to overlap with image prune
[21:54:16] <ada_> what do you want to happen?
[21:55:22] <greentree> reclaim disk space
[21:55:33] <ada_> by removing ...
[21:55:42] <ada_> you want to clean up ALL containers? only EXITED containers?
[21:55:46] <ada_> im asking about what should bne removed
[21:56:09] <ada_> all images?  only images older than 24h old? only images matching a certain name?
[21:56:31] <greentree> resources that are 12+ hours old
[21:57:18] <ada_> ok so prune isn't going to do that
[21:57:27] <ada_> I don't think the containers filter has a way to filter based on time, lemme check
[21:58:44] <ada_> if you really wanted to do that you could get creative with `jq` to filter for all teh containers that are actually CreatedAt 12+ hours ago
[22:01:15] <ada_> so `container prune` has a filter like `image prune` does
[22:01:29] <ada_> `system prune` is heavy handed, especially with -f and --volume
[22:01:49] <ada_> I prefer to use filters with `docker container rm` 
[22:02:47] <ada_> you might have a syntax error in your filter statement, it should be --filter until=24h
[22:02:58] <ada_> or until=12h if you want that
[22:04:03] <ada_> most of the time if something is stuck deleting you could restart the daemon, thats probably what I would do first;  and I would replace the 'system prune' into 'container prune', 'image prune', etc. so that you can use the until filter more easily
