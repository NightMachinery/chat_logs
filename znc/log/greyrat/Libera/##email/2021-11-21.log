[01:22:41] <rob0> You can't send mail to scraped address and say it's not spam.
[01:23:06] <thumbs> indeed, based on what you said, you are a spammer
[01:23:49] <rob0> Legitimate marketing mail is when people sign up (and give you their address) to get the mail.
[01:24:12] <thumbs> well, sometimes they hide the checkbox in a page when you submit
[01:24:49] <thumbs> while despicable, at least you can opt out after

[11:21:09] <acagastya> Hi, I have been receiving spam from an email, this is the header.  https://0x0.st/-7-y.txt -- any idea how I could block it in postfix, and which is the domain I should do a whois to report abuse?
[11:24:57] <acagastya> The one I got before that was https://0x0.st/-7-t.txt
[11:45:27] <pj> acagastya: the best indicator I can see there is that it fails FCRDNS
[11:45:35] <pj> !t acagastya fcrdns
[11:45:45] <pj> hrmmmm
[11:45:48] <pj> !fcrdns
[11:45:49] <dig-dug> pj: fcrdns: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Confirmed_reverse_DNS : your IP address should resolve to your HELO/EHLO hostname, which in turn should resolve back to your IP. This is very important if you want big sites to accept your mail. If you can't have it from your ISP, see !relayhost
[11:45:51] <pj> oh, right
[11:45:59] <pj> !tell acagastya fcrdns
[11:45:59] <dig-dug> acagastya: fcrdns: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_Confirmed_reverse_DNS : your IP address should resolve to your HELO/EHLO hostname, which in turn should resolve back to your IP.

[11:47:42] <pj> also the IP address itself is assigned to an ISP in Romania.
[11:49:13] <pj> well, one is from Romania one is from Bulgaria...
[11:52:12] <pj> ...also both IP addresses are listed in several DNSRBLs so you could reject them simply by checking those.
[11:56:19] <pj> !t acagastya dnsrbl
[11:56:19] <dig-dug> acagastya: I do not know about 'dnsrbl', but I do know about these similar topics: 'dnswl'

[11:56:30] <pj> bleh
[12:02:43] <acagastya> !dnsbl_test
[12:02:44] <dig-dug> acagastya: dnsbl_test: (#1) Many DNSBLs support a special test record of 127.0.0.2, so you can dig 2.0.0.127.zen.spamhaus.org. any to test Zen, for example., or (#2) See also http://crynwr.com/spam/ to test your server's use of various DNSBLs.
[12:04:57] <pj> !t acagastya rbl
[12:04:57] <dig-dug> acagastya: I do not know about 'rbl', but I do know about these similar topics: 'brbl', 'multirbl'
[12:05:00] <pj> bleh
[12:05:56] <pj> !t acagastya rbl
[12:05:56] <dig-dug> acagastya: rbl: short for realtime black list . RBLs are DNS zones that can help your mail server to determine if an IP address is trusted. It's a great way to fight spam. See https://www.spamhaus.org/zen/ http://www.sorbs.net/ https://www.spamcop.net/
