[01:40:57] <slaughter> I'm trying to pipe the output of a command through some things, but the command itself never drops back to the shell (you have to ctrl+C it normally) - google is failing me by finding all kinds of unrelated things. How do I work with this?

[01:42:45] <geirha> it means one of the commands in the pipeline doesn't exit
[01:43:46] <wstrnr> if it can be killed by ctrl-c, and if this results in normal safe termination, you can send this command SIGINT or SIGTERM when it can is detected that the job is done
[01:44:08] <sublim20> can you post the command?
[01:44:47] <slaughter> It's a specific CLI tool, the Severless Framework. Command I'm messing with here is `serverless deploy list`
[01:44:56] <slaughter> Though `deploy` seems to do the same thing
[01:46:04] <Soliton> so does that program terminate by itself if you run it outside a pipeline?
[01:46:08] <slaughter> Nay

[01:48:32] <Soliton> why*
[01:49:01] <slaughter> Yeah because the deploy command doesn't exit I am hacking together a way to verify the deploy happened, but the deploy list doesn't exit so that's where I'm at
[01:49:13] <ormaaj> Something's blocking its sigpipe
[01:49:14] <slaughter> I can assume that after 10 seconds it would be done
[01:50:09] <Soliton> so run it in the background and kill it after 10 seconds.
[01:50:20] <Soliton> or run it with timeout if you have that.
[01:50:41] <Soliton> !timeout
[01:50:52] <ormaaj> of course that has to be combined with it not exiting properly as you'd not normally have that happen by mistake.

[01:53:54] <wstrnr> slaughter: if the program that does not terminate can output something that can act as marker of end of the work, you can read this and kill the program from some other process

[14:00:21] <earendel> just that declare -p will print its error regardless of subshell. or so. you would actually need to jusify that &> /dev/null esoteric  .. im not entirely sure what &> is  .. but you supressed the output. usually ( ) will get you just the exit value of whatever is run in the subshell..right?  while $( ) should give the output. i dunno.. but it seems it's not correct for all fds
[14:00:45] <emanuele6> !&>
[14:00:45] <greybot> &> is a bash-specific feature. «&>file» is equivalent to «>file 2>&1». There is no &>> until Bash4. Use «>>file 2>&1» instead. We recommend not using &> or &>> in scripts, because it will break some valid scripts (see !badredir), and is an unintuitive syntax for beginners.

[15:32:33] <tessio> there isn't wordsplitting after command substitution ?
[15:32:39] <wstrnr> !wordsplitting >tessio
[15:32:39] <greybot> tessio: echo $foo; rm $foo -- If you leave $foo unquoted, bash will *remove* all whitespace (newlines, spaces, tabs) while expanding it, take each *word* as a separate argument. `echo` prints these words separated by one space and `rm` deletes each word. So ALWAYS *quote* your parameter expansions: echo "$foo" -- http://mywiki.wooledge.org/WordSplitting

[15:33:04] <emanuele6> there is word splitting only after substitutions only on the substituted parts
[15:33:07] <Soliton> if there wasn't it'd be one big word and won't do what you want either.

[15:47:07] <wstrnr> earnest: i agree with the multipart script scenario.  if your "script" is composed of multiple parts, it has to be properly installed (especially internationalization files, configs, /usr/lib/some-name/* helper programs or libraries etc.), yes such filenames have to be hardcoded.  practically, in such cases there should be a ./configure script in your codebase, and it should be executed by users during installation to convert the
[15:47:07] <wstrnr> your-script.in file - where instead of filenames there are %special_markers% - into your-script with all filenames filled in, effectively hardcoded
[15:47:52] <earnest> wstrnr: hardcode, djb's slashpackage article on finding should put to bed most of these things
[15:47:55] <wstrnr> earnest: but in "Usage: ..." messages it is better to display the program name the way user called the program

[21:57:40] <LiENUS> i'm trying to wrap a repeated run of a go test suite in a bash script with whiptail giving me a progress bar. it's just supposed to run it the specified number of times, display progress and break if there's an error in the suite then at the end show the output of the last run of the test suite, either success if successful or the error message if it breaks i have everything but that last result display here...

They (er, we) have a tool (compiled thing I can't touch) that is executed as 'command input' (where 'input' can come from a well-defined, albeit long, list).  Now, for my execution, I just create an array and run the commad in a loop.  What pitfalls am I setting myself up for if I script it out to take the input
