[13:19:42] <Cjefke> hi somebody who can help me for like really 2 minutes:O
[13:22:22] <stenno> just ask your question and then we can see
[13:22:53] <Cjefke> http://www.chatarea.nl:8033/ChatArea/onchan/ i want these nicks to be under eachother 
[13:22:59] <Cjefke> instead of next to eachother
[13:23:06] <Cjefke> https://pastebin.com/vHBznPQC
[13:24:07] <stenno> check out #css for styling
[13:27:12] <Pilum> And please, don't learn HTML from 25 year old sources. :-P
[13:27:32] <Cjefke> (:
[13:27:41] <Cjefke> well i only need to read the nicks out
[13:27:44] <Pilum> HTML 4.01 Transitional has literally been on the "do not use" list for 20 years.
[13:28:18] <Pilum> <!DOCTYPE html> is all you need and all you want.
[13:28:44] <Cjefke> done that
[13:29:15] <Pilum> Next up, remove <center> and align="center"
[13:30:04] <Pilum> And if they qualify as tabular data, put them in a table. Although I suspect in this case you want an unordered list.
[13:31:37] <Pilum> And remove all the attributes from <body> that you have as well.
[13:32:12] <Pilum> The content of your style element should not be commented.
[13:33:18] <Cjefke> yeah you fixed it
[13:33:20] <Cjefke> well
[13:33:30] <Cjefke> we both did, you gave the kick
[13:33:31] <Pilum> Your HTML is currently invalid.
[13:34:24] <Pilum> There's a stray " at the end of your doctype declaration, and you're printing </tr>s which don't belong.
[13:34:45] <Cjefke> :)
[13:34:49] <Cjefke> i will remove them;-)
[13:34:51] <Pilum> And the attributes you put on body have long since been deprecated in favour of CSS.
[13:35:43] <Cjefke> (:
[13:36:19] <Pilum> Adding orphaned table cells (<td>) doesn't improve it much. You still need the table. But, again, that doesn't look like tabular data to me. It looks like a list of nicks, in which case <ul> and <li> are the elements you want.
[13:36:37] <Pilum> And if you don't want the dots of the list, remove them with CSS.
[13:37:45] <Cjefke> well it's for my nicklist on the rightside
[13:37:48] <Cjefke> http://chatarea.nl/
[13:38:14] <Pilum> Sounds like a perfect use for <ul>
[13:39:06] <Pilum> But if you're going to include it in a page like that, you don't want anything else in your file than the list.
[13:39:28] <Cjefke> yeah it includes the page
[13:39:33] <Cjefke> got it now like this
[13:39:33] <Cjefke> https://pastebin.com/RC4Xw18J
[13:41:42] <Pilum> https://hastebin.com/ehawipefej.html - in which case, make it look like that.
[13:42:54] <Pilum> https://hastebin.com/uziyonuyas.html <- this is what you have now, and that's not correct HTML.
[13:43:16] <Pilum> A HTML document inside another one like that is not valid.
[13:43:21] <Cjefke> changed it
[13:43:28] <Cjefke> but did <br /> after the nick
[13:43:46] <Cjefke> because mine index.php count's the <br /> for the total nicks online
[13:43:55] <Pilum> Heh.
[13:44:38] <Pilum> Well, it's much better, at least.
[13:45:06] <Cjefke> (:
[13:45:12] <Cjefke> thanks for the help
[13:45:44] <Pilum> You're welcome.
