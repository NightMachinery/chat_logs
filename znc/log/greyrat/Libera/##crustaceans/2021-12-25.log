[00:33:16] <dminkovsky> a cool app would be like `bibliographyhero` or something
[00:33:21] <dminkovsky> what it would do, is
[00:33:34] <dminkovsky> for a given book, have a list of all the various works cited throughout the text
[00:33:59] <imode> dminkovsky:  sounds about fuckin' right lmao.
[00:34:27] <dminkovsky> i read books and i get caught up looking up one work cited after the next, cause there's no bibliography or works cited at the end
[00:34:34] <dminkovsky> or they don't actually have everything mentioned in the text
[00:34:43] <dminkovsky> this app certainly has no commercial value
[00:34:48] <dminkovsky> imode: i went to this store, it was ok
[00:35:01] <dminkovsky> solid beyond the sheer novelty

[01:15:10] <imode> do they sell shotgun wedding kits.
[01:15:37] <manicennui> You probably have to get the meth out back.

[02:07:11] <gerikson> so Drew essentially wants to solve the problem of copyright by guaranteeing everyone a basic standard of living so that artists are free to do whatever w/o having to chase $$$

[03:01:44] <kline> dminkovsky, at lan events they would use clothes pegs, and you would clip them onto the ethernet cable where it plugged into your network card
[03:02:30] <kline> ownership of the clip meant ownership of the ip, pegs can be returned and reused, and you can walk down the back of tables looking at IPs

[05:28:19] <buttsbot> Hippie trail - Wikipedia
[05:28:45] <dminkovsky> One travel experience, undertaken by hundreds of thousands of hippies between 1969 and 1971, was the Hippie trail overland route to India. Carrying little or no luggage, and with small amounts of cash, almost all followed the same route, hitch-hiking across Europe to Athens and on to Istanbul, then by train through central Turkey via Erzurum, continuing by bus into Iran, via Tabriz and Tehran to
[05:28:51] <dminkovsky> Mashhad, across the Afghan border into Herat, through southern Afghanistan via Kandahar to Kabul, over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan, via Rawalpindi and Lahore to the Indian frontier. Once in India, hippies went to many different destinations, but gathered in large numbers on the beaches of Goa and Kovalam in Trivandrum (Kerala),[128] or crossed the border into Nepal to spend months in Kathmandu.
[05:28:57] <dminkovsky> In Kathmandu, most of the hippies hung out in the tranquil surroundings of a place called Freak Street,[129] (Nepal Bhasa: Jhoo Chhen) which still exists near Kathmandu Durbar Square.
[05:29:17] <dminkovsky> that sounds pretty amazing
[05:36:02] <manicennui> I think one of my former coworkers must have done that.
[05:36:13] <manicennui> He told us a bit about hiking across the Middle East decades ago
[05:40:10] <dminkovsky> that sounds like this
