[00:37:43] <pyzozord> gnome has .desktop files
[00:38:10] <InPhase> The ELF format is kernel level, while embedding icons is a DE feature, and it is not a gui kernel.
[00:38:24] <InPhase> So they go into separate files.
[00:38:51] <oldlaptop> Some lunatic could invent an ELF field for icons that desktops could read, in principle.
[00:39:03] <pulse> i would very much like that lunatic to do so
[00:39:13] <oldlaptop> In practice one doesn't normally work with "executables" directly with anything that would display icons.
[00:39:22] <GeDaMo> What if you want to change the icon for your program?

[00:39:26] <Guest86> pulse it does have icons
[00:39:31] <InPhase> It could be done.  Or ELF could be replaced purely to add icons.  But the unix philosophy tends to like division of purpose.
[00:39:37] <Guest86> executables get icons in file manager
[00:39:42] <Guest86> on desktop
[00:39:53] <pulse> Guest86, i mean, the file itself just shows up as a generic icon
[00:39:54] <InPhase> And yeah, it would really get in the way of theming.
[00:40:06] <Guest86> that's prolly nautilus thing
[00:40:16] <Guest86> oh
[00:40:18] <Guest86> yeah

[00:41:03] <Guest86> technically I think You don't go to executable files themselfs anyway, You use shortcut or terminal
[00:41:21] <pulse> where does the shortcut get its icon
[00:41:36] <pulse> i find linux somewhat confusing lately
[00:41:39] <Guest86> it's defined in shortcut file
[00:41:40] <InPhase> pulse: It seems AppImage has an icon bundling feature.  Maybe you want that format.  :)
[00:41:43] <oldlaptop> The "shortcut" is itself a text file following the specification pyzozord linked you to.
[00:41:58] <oldlaptop> Among the things it specifies is the location of a plain, ordinary image file to use as the icon.
[00:42:00] <pyzozord> I don't think there are "shortcuts" in linux, at least ubuntu
[00:42:07] <Guest86> there is
[00:42:16] <Guest86> .desktop files
[00:42:29] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: Nothing known by that name, but there are at least two concepts (symbolic links and XDG desktop files) that fill a vaguely similar role.
[00:42:35] <InPhase> Although I don't know if anything actually reads AppImage icons and uses them.

[00:48:04] <oldlaptop> If your source code is "licensed under the terms of GPLv3", you distribute your source code.
[00:48:14] <pulse> oldlaptop, and tell everyone to build it themselves?
[00:48:31] <pulse> i mean, that's... fine with me
[00:48:39] <alefir> no, you compile and package it, and then also make the source available
[00:48:53] <pyzozord> I like it better if it's a .deb, or a snap or at least a custom apt repo
[00:48:55] <pulse> and you offer packages on some website or what
[00:49:03] <alefir> pretty much yeah
[00:49:06] <oldlaptop> If it's useful enough, people will distribute binaries for their systems for you.
[00:49:19] <pulse> i see
[00:49:35] <alefir> pulse: but you make the website readable by the appropriate package manager, so that it can automagically grab and install stuff with one simple terminal command

[00:50:45] <pulse> i'm a very lazy person
[00:50:54] <alefir> then my package manager doesn't know it exists, meaning its more effort on my end
[00:51:06] <oldlaptop> Someone might use that, but if your software is useful enough practically nobody will bother with your binary
[00:51:35] <pulse> interesting
[00:51:36] <oldlaptop> (because it'll be an apt-get, or yum, or whatever, away)
[00:51:39] <pyzozord> if it's a cli program I might download it and put it in some /usr/local/bin

[00:54:18] <pyzozord> man hier and man file-hierarchy tells you about common places you put stuff
[00:54:54] <pulse> actually right, i forgot, it's common to just ~/.yourapp

[00:58:06] <pulse> i'm traditional. i feel an application should be contained in a single folder
[00:58:06] <pyzozord> except there are certain places that serve as common interfaces

[00:58:37] <oldlaptop> I'm traditional. I feel all the binaries should be in one place, and all the resources in another.
[00:58:43] <pulse> :p
[00:58:57] <pulse> i think i might settle for ~/.app/things
[00:58:59] <pyzozord> they are less part of your app and more interface to your app, like where your app has config? in /etc, where it has runtime data? in /tmp or /var etc

[00:59:35] <nomagno> pulse: that is the place they store config files
[00:59:44] <oldlaptop> Configuration files that belong to the user should go under $HOME, somewhere.
[00:59:51] <pulse> actually just ~/.app might be enough
[00:59:55] <pyzozord> ~/.config/myapp is a more idomatic place
[00:59:57] <nomagno> Libraries go in $PREFIX/lib, and binaries in $PREFIX/bin
[01:00:05] <nomagno> ^
[01:00:18] <oldlaptop> Configuration files that should apply system-wide will generally go under /etc.
[01:00:41] <oldlaptop> If they're so static they shouldn't even be changed by system administrators, they should go under $PREFIX/share.
[01:01:23] <pulse> i've seen linux apps that are just self-contained in one directory too though
[01:01:27] <pulse> but they're kinda rare
[01:01:42] <nomagno> Or ~/.local/ is a local prefix. ~/.config/myapp is where user-specific config files go.
[01:01:58] <pyzozord> although really many programs do ~/.stuff/ too for example ~/.irssi ~/.npm ~/.kube even ~/.zoom
[01:02:03] <pulse> ok so what if you have like, 10mb of text data with your app

[01:06:59] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: some programs do it
[01:07:04] <nomagno> And then Linux uses etc because... uh, good question
[01:07:04] <nomagno> /etc/ is literally just a BIG heap of files
[01:07:09] <pulse> at which point of some app's installation would such resource files be copied somewhere
[01:07:51] <pulse> let's say you want to bundle 52 card PNGs with your app
[01:07:53] <oldlaptop> `make install` or the rough equivalent copies things under $PREFIX/bin, $PREFIX/lib, and $PREFIX/share (and maybe other places) as is appropriate.
[01:07:55] <nomagno> pulse: decided by the packager. The usual way of proceeding is you either release the source in a well-classified manner or do all the packaging yourself if there is no source
[01:07:57] <pulse> how the heck do you do that
[01:08:11] <pyzozord> there are only few basic categories of things: binaries, program data, program config, user data, user config
[01:08:21] <pyzozord> those are the most common ones I think
[01:08:29] <pulse> err
[01:08:35] <nomagno> pulse: Well on Debian, Ubuntu, or Termux, or anything that uses dpkg you'd make a .deb package following the packaging instructions
[01:08:39] *** Joins: rindolf (~shlomif@inkscape/dev/shlomif)
[01:08:56] <nomagno> On RH-based stuff you'd make a .rpm package
[01:09:06] <nomagno> Etc.
[01:09:23] <pulse> i roughly understand but not quite
[01:09:41] <pulse> i'll have to test and see
[01:09:48] <PlanckWalk> While the formats and tools for the package types differ, the means of creating them are very similar.
[01:10:14] <pyzozord> each family of distros has it's own package manager, each package manger has it's own format
[01:10:20] *** ik is now known as kleiner
[01:10:25] *** kleiner is now known as ik
[01:10:31] <pulse> if all i want is to bundle a bunch of data with my app, what would i do
[01:10:45] <pulse> just copy that data to somewhere during install and call it a day i guess?
[01:10:58] <alefir> well thats what installing is
[01:11:14] <PlanckWalk> In theory you can tell the package manager to just splatter files anywhere you like, but there's a standard that's generally followed.
[01:11:16] <oldlaptop> You copy the data to $PREFIX/share/pulsesthing.
[01:11:30] <oldlaptop> $PREFIX should not be hardcoded, but should default to /usr/local.
[01:11:54] <pulse> hmm
[01:11:59] <pulse> i see
[01:12:22] <pulse> this is gonna wreck my brain when i have to do somewhat the opposite on windows side
[01:12:34] <pyzozord> .deb etc are just archive files with a bunch of extra manifest files in them
[01:12:46] <oldlaptop> Some packaging systems will also use an environment variable named DESTDIR, which when set causes things to be copied under $DESTDIR, instead of under /.
[01:13:00] <nomagno> pulse: Most package formats are just a tarball/compressed archive that contains all necessary files then a format-specific config file. This config file tells the config file the type of each file, so you make a .deb, and the package manager for that format (dpkg) will decompress it, read the info, and put the files in the distro-specific places
[01:13:12] <oldlaptop> (The package is then fundamentally a tarball of everything under $DESTDIR.)
[01:13:25] <nomagno> Yeah manifest is more accurate
[01:13:31] <pulse> nomagno, ok but how do i then fetch data from my app not knowing those specific distro places
[01:14:07] <oldlaptop> You generally allow that to be configured at build time.
[01:14:18] <roxlu> hi, does someone knows if you can save/share a GDB session?
[01:14:21] <pulse> yeah i need practice, theory won't help much
[01:14:24] <oldlaptop> (that is, $PREFIX probably translates into some #define somewhere)
[01:14:34] <nomagno> pulse: Adding to what oldlaptop said, the XDG standard, a ridiculously detailed document that specifies a bunch of stuff
[01:14:43] <apotheon> ugh
[01:14:52] <pulse> nomagno, i'll check it out
[01:14:55] <apotheon> Do not follow the entire XDG BDS.  It's a snarl of nastiness.
[01:14:59] <pulse> tnx
[01:15:02] <nomagno> ... apotheon you don't miss a beat do you?
[01:15:05] <oldlaptop> Most application developers can generally ignore most of XDG most of the time.
[01:15:11] <pyzozord> pulse: you can use relative paths your binary was in something/bin so you can ../share/mystuff/data
[01:15:32] <nomagno> pyzozord: No, that's not good practice at all I'd say
[01:15:35] <oldlaptop> The desktop entry specification pyzozord linked earlier is important, if you want desktop icons or menu entries or things of that nature.
[01:15:46] <nomagno> ^
[01:15:48] <pulse> pyzozord, yeah i know that but if they're distro-specific then they could be otherwise. can't just hardcode them
[01:16:14] <pyzozord> each distro will have it's own build anyway so that should help a bit
[01:16:29] <nomagno> XDG is excessively detailed in many places but it also contains a lot of fundamental assumptions about how a unixy system that aims for compatibility should organize its files
[01:16:38] <apotheon> The BDS is such a shitshow that it's documented using several different formats for different parts of the specification.
[01:16:39] <pyzozord> nomagno: I agree, honestly I'm not sure how else to do it for .deb that installs a cli program
[01:17:15] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: Generally, there will be a build-time option for where architecture-independent data files are expected to be.
[01:17:20] <nomagno> pulse: Definitely, you want to use environment variables at some point in the chain, be it build-time, installation-time, or just the dreaded POSIX library getvar() crap
[01:17:20] <apotheon> nomagno: I'm probably missing several beats right now, actually.
[01:17:45] <oldlaptop> It will generally translate to a C preprocessor macro, or some equivalent.

[01:19:44] <pyzozord> I was wondering because I don't have such envvar 
[01:19:54] <pyzozord> ok, so simply hardcoded places

[10:05:56] <anomal> novns: actually this is the problem, determinism. Imagine you need to iterate a hashmap. It has no predefined order. You can scan bucket by bucket and emit every item in the bucket's linked list in order. This leaks implementation details.
[10:06:18] *** Joins: elastic_dog (~elastic_d@2a01:118f:822:9c00:f583:aa51:9ad4:d4fb)
[10:06:21] <anomal> novns: so I've concluded you can only iterate in a predetermined abstract deterministic order. BUT... sorting a hashmap is expensive. 
[10:06:32] <anomal> novns: what's a compromise... make it strongly random
[10:07:04] <anomal> novns: this way you can't analyze the order
[10:07:13] <novns> anomal, you can use a map without hashing of keys
[10:07:24] <novns> so keys will be ordered
[10:07:37] <anomal> novns: I think you're describing a b-tree or something like that
[10:07:41] <novns> why do you need to hash them at all?
[10:07:55] <novns> for what reason?
[10:07:59] <anomal> novns: I never said i have to. But if it's a hashmap, that's kinda the scenario
[10:08:18] <anomal> novns: how'd you match a hashmap's efficiency of indexing without a hashmap
[10:08:35] <novns> well, if a hashmap is the problem, just don't use it
[10:08:48] <anomal> novns: and use what
[10:09:12] <novns> a lot of binary trees are there for you
[10:09:25] <anomal> novns: b-trees are there, but I didn't say i have a problem with b-trees.

[11:07:41] <ski> (linearity (or affinity, which is almost the same) is not the same as uniqueness. with the latter, you know the reference you get haven't been duplicated in the past. with the former, you're prohibited from duplicating it in the future (but it might've already been duplicated in the past))

[11:12:37] <anomal> ski: the problem is the set exists in a specific place. I don't want to pass it around functions like it's some string or something. It can be literally GBs worth of data
[11:12:45] <rm_rf> That's the guy who told me to learn Go

[15:45:41] <Duckle> Hey there. I want to build some lab automation software for our testing lab, and I want it to be nice and user friendly because a lot of the people who'll use it aren't computer savvy.
[15:45:41] <Duckle> The general idea is to have a gui where a user can pick a test, and that test then gives them some input fields and an output.
[15:45:41] <Duckle> Most of what we need to work with has nice python libraries, so I'd like to do this in python. I'm thinking I'd want to create each test as a python file, and somehow have a list of input/outputs, that then populate the gui when opened.

[15:59:38] <rm_rf> Okay, fine, I admit it: I am a louse, though, I am one satisfied louse…. After forewarning  a girl I have been seeing a few times, I finally pulled the trigger and left her at Hennigans. She had spent far too much time on the phone while we were together.  After thirty-five minutes of her texting, I told her I needed to use the restroom and quietly strolled out of the East exit facing
[15:59:40] <rm_rf> Broadway. When she called thirty minutes later, questioning my whereabouts, I told her she seemed to be dating her phone and not me and that her phone, and not I, should drive her home and  pay the tab. She is, well, rude. I had given her a fair shot and told her I wouldn’t put up with this behavior any longer, as I warned her a final time on the third date. That was it – it was over

[17:39:42] <user51> i have a question about reading input. after something like 'read(0, buf, sizeof buf);' is executed, are there now two copies of the input - source and buf?
[17:40:12] <Decker> what source?
[17:40:47] <user51> i can only think of files and pipes
[17:41:04] <GeDaMo> If it's a file, the file still exists
[17:41:06] <mrig> Oh nice yes the tty command is superb, whoever mentioned that.
[17:41:37] <GeDaMo> Otherwise, the kernel might have an internal buffer part of which gets copied to your buffer then discarded
[17:41:43] <Decker> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20860478/gdb-redirect-target-stdout-temporarly  mrig actually
[17:41:44] <bayaz> Title: GDB: redirect target stdout temporarly 
[17:42:02] <mrig> you just type tty /dev/tty/n where n is the number of the tty given by running that command in the second terminal.
[17:42:24] <user51> cool, one more tidbit to learn. thanks!
[17:42:33] <mrig> and gdb just send it there instead, I was having trouble with the input args using r > /dev/null

[19:32:27] <absentia> it appears that this is the proposal accepted for go 1.18, and they now call them "constraints"
[19:32:42] <absentia> which is convenient because the `(Ord k) => ...` construction from haskell is known as a "Typeclass constraint"
[19:32:48] <pyzozord> ah ok "Ordered is a type constraint that matches any ordered type. // An ordered type is one that supports the <, <=, >, and >= operators."

[19:34:32] <absentia> well
[19:35:01] <pyzozord> but the point "each function should have unique signature" I don't agree with
[19:35:34] <absentia> not sure where he says that
[19:35:41] <absentia> i think he's saying you should eliminate concrete types from your signatures
[19:35:52] <absentia> and strive for type variables (parametric polymorphism / "generics") as much as possible
[19:36:04] <absentia> like... instead of writing a function for sorting []int... and []char...
[19:36:09] <absentia> a function for sorting []T
[19:36:11] <absentia> as long as T is orderable
[19:37:09] <pyzozord> Yes. That's how I interpret it. That leads to each function having unique signature because they are generic. That leads argument names being useless because you can tell what argument does just from it's type and the function signature in general

[19:37:44] <lilcoder> anyone here has ever done the job of detecting outlier in a dataset before ? the thing is i am wondering if it's possible to get rid of all outlier 100% 
[19:37:50] <absentia> look at this bullshit from dynamic languages, like `function (config: Object) => Object`
[19:37:56] <absentia> the hell am I supposed to do with that
[19:38:02] <absentia> great, it's a config
[19:38:04] <absentia> of what?
[19:38:09] <oldlaptop> lilcoder: To do that you'd have to rigorously define "outliers" somehow.
[19:38:10] <GeDaMo> lilcoder: how do you define 'outlier'?
[19:39:04] <GeDaMo> Are the data points numeric? You could calculate a centre (average) then the distance to each point
[19:39:07] <lilcoder> GeDaMo: for now, i can only think of it in the term of a value being ridiculously big or very small in column being filled with continuous values 
[19:39:08] <pulse> probably outlier is where delta is way bigger than between most other data
[19:39:14] <absentia> pulse: burn it
[19:39:25] <pyzozord> absentia: sure it does tell you a lot, I think that kind of excessive dose of abstraction is not practical

[19:40:12] <oldlaptop> pyzozord: the question: at which point does this nice type system that proves things about your program become more trouble than it's worth?
[19:40:13] <lilcoder> GeDaMo: i mean i did calculate the lower bound and upper bound then check for row with value lower than lower bound or bigger than upper bound and delete that, but the result isn't as 100% as i thought

[23:42:34] <teut> If you have a field that's private it means no other class can get at it. Wrong! If you really want to you can subvert the access control mechanisms in almost any language.
[23:42:47] <absentia> teut: start reading bytes according to the memory layout of the struct/class
[23:42:58] <teut> you mean deassemble it?
[23:43:03] <teut> dis*
[23:43:05] <absentia> teut: sure, that's one way
[23:43:17] <absentia> it would be more inspecting memory at runtime
[23:43:19] <teut> no that is not what I would call a way
[23:43:32] <teut> what does that mean?
[23:43:34] <absentia> as opposed to disassembling the text section into readable assembly
[23:43:48] <absentia> teut: I mean using things like `x/w` in gdb
[23:43:53] <absentia> to examine one word of memory at a given address
[23:44:04] <absentia> if you have a pointer to a struct or class, and you know its memory layout
[23:44:13] <absentia> you can just start offsetting from the pointer and reading out bytes however you want
[23:44:20] <absentia> this is also a great way to corrupt data
[23:44:26] <teut> oh ok ok , there is that shown in Visual Studio
[23:44:31] <teut> the memory addresses etc
[23:44:36] <absentia> visual studio actually has a fantastic debugger
[23:44:44] <absentia> i would spend time exploring it

[23:47:58] <pulse> pretty basic for the most part
[23:48:10] <pulse> i'd say vscode is one of the easiest to setup ide-like editors
