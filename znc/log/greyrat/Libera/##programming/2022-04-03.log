[02:02:59] <vdamewood> Well, Let's say you have a system that uses cartridges to load programs. Those cards will have the program code on ROM chips, and these ROM chips will get mapped to sections of memory. The ROM will be fine for the program code, and read-only values, but modifiable values will need to be copied to RAM in order to be changed. So the loader will copy that section to RAM, and use the RAM copy while running the program.

[02:11:03] <ProfSimm> vdamewood: interesting I never thought about it like that. Only load sectors that you need to change
[02:11:38] <vdamewood> ProfSimm: Well, with ROM you don't actually load it. It's just sitting there in memory ready to read.
[02:11:52] <ProfSimm> vdamewood: it's a bit like bindings in functional programming. You make a closure and you can shadow var i with a local var i with another value, but in the parent scope the var i still has the same value
[02:12:27] <ProfSimm> vdamewood: sure, well you copy the parts you have to change as you said, so you "load" them in a way
[02:12:34] <ProfSimm> But only those parts.
[02:13:38] <vdamewood> Sure, but the parts you don't change are still accessible in memory,l without copying them anywhere. And when you 'load' the modifiable parts, it looks, to the CPU, like you're just copying from one section of memory to another.
[02:15:14] <ProfSimm> vdamewood: probably, but i think shadowing is also a thing with memory controllers. I might be wrong

[02:28:26] <JanC> it's (more or less) fixed because that makes management much easier  :)
[02:28:30] <ProfSimm> And the "word" (bus size) is a sector of bytes

[03:31:11] <pulse> as such it necessarily maps to hardware more poorly (even if the abstraction manages to be efficient, that's besides the point)
[03:31:13] <dTal> C hides a bunch of hardware from the programmer
[03:31:22] <pulse> ProfSimm, that's not too complex

[03:31:31] <ProfSimm> pulse: why don't you complain when this works in C:   int x = 1 + 2 + 3;
[03:31:36] <dTal> C is an abstraction over assembly, and a poor one

[03:31:43] <ProfSimm> pulse: like why doesn't it force you to write this in two statements

[04:07:36] <pulse> Ali_A, symbolic definition is when you create an variable/function name. symbolic reference is when you use it in code
[04:07:48] <pulse> Ali_A, according to some stack overflow answers i've read, anyway. i think that should be right
[04:08:07] <nomagno> Wait... My C project is ACTUALLY approaching the 10k LoC mark!
[04:08:08] <pulse> nomagno, that's a good point wrt. NNs and security
[04:08:08] <vdamewood> Ali_A: When you have a global variable, or a function, that variable or function gets a 'symbol' that the linker uses to find it.

[04:09:01] <vdamewood> Ali_A: The definition is where the variable is store, or where the function's code is stored. A reference is where the function is called, or where the variable is used.

[04:12:16] <davros> ie with the right design you can do C++'s job in a simpler language

[04:13:03] <nomagno> I don't follow unstable
[04:13:03] <davros> rust has grown , but will stay simpler than C++, because of a few early choices

[04:22:10] <nomagno> Rust's object orientation is very subtle

[13:31:32] <ent58> So imagine you have a working way to compile and execute user-provided code over the network (think C code with a compiler available to the application)...already sounds terrible, but if you had to design a way to handle utterly arbitrary code, would you do so at the source level, or possibly analyze the generated assembly?
[13:32:49] <GeDaMo> Are you thinking in terms of sandboxing?
[13:33:02] <ent58> I'm thinking that at a source level, you'd be able to do something like control what symbols are referenced, create a sort of "cage" in which the code may operate and only have defined interfaces to communicate to the wider world
[13:33:44] <ent58> It's sort of like sandboxing, actually
[13:34:02] <GeDaMo> The problem with something like C is that it's very flexible, there are many ways to do things you might not want it to do
[13:35:13] <ent58> Yeah I mean how do you stop `volatile char *hehe = rand()*rand(); *hehe = 42;`
[13:35:29] <ent58> (forgetting conversion problems)
[13:35:50] <ent58> I feel like statically analyzing the generated assembly is actually easier
[13:36:01] <GeDaMo> You might also need runtime checks

[13:38:49] <ent58> and if the code tries to do anything dumb like this

[14:51:28] <Decker> :) not when writing code... you write in a higher language and target wasm
[14:52:07] <Decker> but really - wasm is targeting something else - so there is consideration for how wasm targets that native layer too
[14:52:13] <Decker> (I guess?)
[14:53:27] <amigojapan> How would you say get the correct URL on the browser in C, this is a part of wasm that confuses me, or get to the dom
[14:53:32] <ent58> I can get on board with the idea that WASM is trying to import some of the optimization into the structure itself, but maybe it shouldn't be named webassembly ._.
[14:53:58] <Decker> you ask the js host layer for it

[14:57:11] <pyzozord> ProfSimm: also this sounds like the real reason "There is one thing that may have been a major factor to the decision not to adopt arbitrary CFGs for WebAssembly control flow. I believe that V8 is an exception to most compilers in that it doesn’t represent code as a CFG at all - it maintains roughly JS-compatible control flow all the way from front-end to codegen. In order to support this V8 
[14:57:17] <pyzozord> would have to be converted to use CFGs, they’d have to implement something like Relooper internally, or they’d have to write a new WebAssembly runtime from scratch. Google was and is a major roadblock to getting this implemented as they have multiple people on the committee in charge of WebAssembly who have veto power."

[23:33:17] <davros> what i need to do is progamatically check if it was set to something , optionally - this value is usually going to be unset
[23:33:35] <davros> atm it looks like i'd have to say "if x !='emsc'"  which is weird voodoo shit
[23:33:40] <pyzozord> I'm suggesting that some other code sets it to 'emsc'

[23:35:36] <pyzozord> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/getItem specifically says that it will return null when they key doesn't exist

[23:35:58] <davros> i think this emscripten wrapper that i actualyl get the value through is doing that

[23:36:50] <pyzozord> could be, but still, I'd first check my code, try to make the simplest reproducible case
[23:37:19] <davros> when i just tried a little thing in pure JS, it was indeed able to return null for missing values
[23:37:31] <pyzozord> chances that some large establish code like the browser or a popular compiler do something wrong are much smaller than that you do something wrong
[23:37:54] <pyzozord> make a new emscripten project with just getting the item and see if it gets it wrong
[23:38:12] <pyzozord> very likely it doesn't. If it does then you found emscripten bug
[23:38:27] <kee> emsc is the first four characters of emscripten?
[23:38:36] *** Quits: xythercoder (~xythercod@49.37.43.214) (Quit: Quit)
[23:38:45] <davros> yeah. why 4 ?
[23:38:50] <kee> Maybe null is being treated as a null reference or something.
[23:39:03] <kee> And emscripten is at the beginning of the "memory".
[23:39:14] <davros> i'm just puttng in handling of the returned ptr being null, but if that was null rust would have crashed already
[23:39:17] <pyzozord> hmm maybe some string pointer aliasing
[23:40:21] <pyzozord> this is a beautiful example of why complexity sucks
