[04:22:42] <emanuele6> how does that apply to cmd1&&cmd2?
[04:22:48] <Nintendo> It's a stylistic choice, emanuele6.  I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it per se, but given that if/then was changed to && in an attempt to solve a problem, there seemed to be some misunderstanding.
[04:23:21] <OnlineCop> My misunderstanding stems from the !if[ response.
[04:23:32] <OnlineCop> It sounded as though using `if [ ... ]` was frowned upon.
[04:23:44] <emanuele6> the pitfall was not relevant there, i still don't get the point of linking that or anything else
[04:23:57] <Nintendo> I already apologized for that.
[04:25:00] <emanuele6> `cmd1 || { cmd2; cmd3; }' could even be better than `if ! cmd1; then cmd2; cmd3; fi' in some case (e.g. if you need to preserve the value of "$?"); there is nothing wrong with cmd1||cmd2 or cmd1&&cmd2

[06:59:12] <larryv> it's fine to ask about POSIX here, although it's best if you clarify that up front so people don't waste their time (and yours) offering bash solutions first

[07:57:19] <emanuele6> the json spec doesn't use regex syntax
[07:57:47] <emanuele6> and the json spec doesn't define numbers like that
[07:57:51] <OnlineCop> True, but they are very strict on the range of characters allowed for each segment, which is SO NICE when actually writing a JSON parser in regex.
[07:59:02] <emanuele6> the json spec allows `12' as a number. also `-1.3e2'
[07:59:40] <OnlineCop> I just mean that they allow 'number' to be defined with [0-9] digits, and not "other locale" digits.
[08:00:07] <emanuele6> either way, no. JSON doesn't allow any [0-9] characters. it allows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

[08:16:56] <OnlineCop> But it looks like test1 is first set to that value, then truncated. test2 is likewise set, then truncated, and then that whole "...|bc" mess runs at the end to compare whether the numbers were close-ish enough to pass a test.
[08:17:39] <OnlineCop> I can't imagine how much fun this will be for that one edge case where one test is 99.99 and the other is 100.01 and fails because of truncation instead of doing actual math.

[14:23:14] <geirha> Aoaks: do you want to print the contents of both deleted files and new files? or just new files?

[18:18:24] <VSpike> I'm pretty sure someone here schooled me years ago on the difference between having job control enabled vs not enabled, but I can't recall the details. What's the difference between backgrounding a process with job control off vs on? Is there any?
[18:19:00] <VSpike> I tested turning off job control and you can still background and use `jobs` but `fg` and `bg` will complain at you so it seems like it's not totally disabled
[18:19:35] <VSpike> I've also forgotten the cases as to when it's enabled vs not ... e.g. it's normally not enabled in a running script I think ... something to do with whether the shell is interactive?
[18:20:01] <Soliton> yes, usually just enabled in an interactive shell.
[18:20:27] <Soliton> "If a command is followed by a & and job control is not active, the default standard input for the command is the empty file /dev/null."  that's one difference for example.
[18:20:29] <emanuele6> job control is only enabled by default in interactive shell, so turning it off in a script does nothing

[23:06:16] *** Joins: crashrep (~crashrep@user/crashrep)
[23:06:22] <Soliton> !nohup
[23:06:22] <greybot> nohup is a hacky wrapper that will execute a process while redirecting its output and preventing SIGHUP from reaching it (some implementations ignore additional signals). In bash, you probably want disown instead: ''command ... & disown''. Alternately, run your commands inside screen or tmux.

[23:11:35] <Soliton> if you really want to handle empty $3 as if it's not there you can use :- instead.

[23:15:30] <emanuele6> checksum=${3-$(sha256sum -- "$1")} is similar to   if (( $# < 3 )); then checksum=$(sha256sum -- "$1"); else checksum=$3; fi
[23:15:37] <alesan> so, the *real* sha256 command is more like: $(sha256sum -- "$archive"  | cut -f 1 -d " ") as I need the checksum only and not the whole output
