[01:45:42] <caveman> is it possible to verify that 14a8713b68cc09bff6d727702149b0a9 is linked all the way down to eec1a6c53e76b7d36c42ca6c8e28d384 without knowing the 2 blocks in the middle (675c6b794849ba7a4ec61f314c05199d and f6600db39c855613f324bcbc1aa082f4)?
[01:45:58] <caveman> here, we only trust the 1st block eec1a6c53e76b7d36c42ca6c8e28d384.  nothing else.

[15:58:10] <brick> Hello, I am an final year undergraduate CS student. I am currently trying to learn about lattice based cryptography, I find it a very difficult field to enter. Does anyone have a work path to recommend? My background consists of : Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Modern Symmetric and Assymetric Cryptography Schemes, a BIT OF Elliptic Curves and Lattices. Also a good understanding of Security Proofs and Complexity Theory and a BIT of Number Theory (the one 
[15:58:22] <brick> that is required to understand most of the modern cryptography) and Singal Processing. My problem is I don't know of a study path to proceed further with Lattices to understand LWE and Ring-LWE
[15:59:40] <brick> Any book recommendations for advanced linear algebra?

[18:13:19] <TimMc> As a kid our TV could only receive a few (analog, broadcast) channels, and one of them usually very poorly. But we could still watch and listen to The Simpsons through the static. If you tried doing that with digital TV with the same level of signal loss, it would be impossible.
[18:13:46] *** Joins: andrade (~andrade@user/andrade)
[18:13:55] <iz> yeah, same.. did you have an antenna rotator?
[18:15:28] <iz> also as a kid, a TV we had used knobs for UHF/VHF tuning and I discovered by accident that you could keep turning the UHF tuning knob up higher than it was suppose to go.. and then you could hear ppl talking on cell phones
[18:16:48] <maroon> yeah, my mom hated the switch from analog to digital tv, because with digital it was like an all-or-nothing transform. and whenever the wind blew it was the 'nothing'
[18:17:47] <iz> yeah, also when the digital signal does cut out, it often makes a loud noise on the sound channel
[18:19:21] <maroon> so like often happens with an 'upgrade', you're forced to take the 'better' version which doesn't turn out to actually be better. and the converter boxes didn't help because they depended on the digital signal
[18:20:22] <iz> the sound part?
[18:20:36] <TimMc> iz: Antenna... rotator?
[18:21:18] <maroon> no, the video part. as for the antenna, yea needed an antenna, as well as moving the tv cart around to find the new 'sweet spot'
[18:21:34] <iz> TimMc: when i was a kid, we had an antenna on the roof the house, and there were like 3-4 broadcast channels.. but couldn't pick them all up w/ the antenna facing the same direction.. so there was a motor on it and a rotator box inside, so you could turn the knob to make the antenna turn
[18:21:40] <TimMc> oh neat
[18:21:56] <TimMc> We just had an indoor bowtie antenna.
[18:21:58] <iz> and then you would like put stickers on the rotator box at different positions for certain channels where they came in well
[18:22:04] <TimMc> hah
[18:22:10] *** Joins: BOKALDO (~BOKALDO@user/bokaldo)
[18:23:00] <TimMc> We just had someone hold the antenna up in various places and then everyone would go "stop, stop, don't move" when the signal came in clear. :-P
[18:23:19] <TimMc> and would then try to like... prop it up on the window frame or something
[18:23:22] <TimMc> all very exciting
[18:23:30] <iz> hehe we did that for awhile too, but could only get like 2-3 channels that way
[18:24:43] <maroon> i still have the problem with the 'smart' tv that frequently forgets a couple of the over-the-air local stations
[18:25:42] <maroon> but they sometimes come back after off/on. but if i rescan the channels i lose all my pre-set schedules

[18:27:35] <yawkat> better audio quality, can be encrypted, lower signal strength required, *and* lower bandwidth.

[18:28:31] <TimMc> What can I say, the digital failure modes seem worse.
[18:28:31] <iz> maroon: mine does that too, i think sometimes the signal is blocked or down for a bit and the smart tv sees it as a channel that doesn't exist any more
[18:29:05] <iz> yeah, i think digital was needed to go HD, right?
[18:29:27] <yawkat> TimMc: if you were to use the bandwidth and signal strength that analog audio has to use for digital audio, youd get *way* better reliability because youd have so much space for redundancy it's not even funny.
[18:29:31] <TimMc> yawkat: I understand why the switch was desirable, but I think they went too far and should have included more error correction (at the expense of bandwidth).
