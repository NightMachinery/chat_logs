[11:22:26] <snappy> what's a good word to describe when a mental illness is in effect. For example, if Alice has Bipolar mental illness, doesn't really mean that the illness is actually in effect.
[11:23:01] <snappy> I guess you could say Alice is experiencing bipolar.
[11:23:34] <snappy> There's also the word morbid, but I'm not sure how to use it.
[11:23:38] <twb> "bipolar" is an obsolete term

[11:25:34] <snappy> Yeah when they're experiencing symptoms.
[11:25:52] <twb> well for bipolar it's using the term "episode"
[11:25:55] <snappy> I could say Alice is experiencing a bipolar episode.
[11:26:05] <snappy> ah yep, that's what i thought
[11:26:09] <twb> So I would say "experiencing a manic episode" or so

[22:50:14] <gitesh> blkshp: what?
[22:50:20] <Bashstreet> lol
[22:50:32] <blkshp> You know what tax is, right?
[22:50:50] <gitesh> blkshp: so tax and other things will be deducted?
[22:50:51] <blkshp> ok...think of it this way...
[22:51:04] <blkshp> You know when you go to work, you get paid money?
[22:51:11] <gitesh> Yes
[22:51:18] <blkshp> That is your "compensation" 
[22:51:23] <gitesh> Yeah
[22:51:27] <blkshp> You are compensated for your time and effort.
[22:51:33] <gitesh> Yes
[22:51:44] <gitesh> So my question is
[22:52:05] <gitesh> Is that compensation after deduction or before deduction
[22:52:08] <blkshp> If you get paid £20000 that is your compensation. Of that, 15% will be tax for example, 5% will be medical insurange
[22:52:21] <gitesh> Oh
[22:52:30] <blkshp> So what it says is that the money you receive will not be subjected to that.
[22:52:35] <blkshp> So therefore you'll get all of it.

[23:15:00] <ln> You don't even need to say yes if you don't have any corrections to make.

[23:23:03] <blkshp> True, it only really says how high it can be compressed without exploding.
[23:23:17] <Bashstreet> Price here is just all tax
[23:23:23] <blkshp> same here

[23:35:07] <tony_hello> Hello everybody so while looking up the definition of a bail bondsman I found the definition a bit confusing. I think the problem is that I don't use the word "whose" very often in affirmative sentences. In this case is the use of "whose"  + "they" what confuses me.
[23:35:13] <tony_hello> Bail bondsmen, also called bail bond agents, provide written agreements to criminal courts to pay the bail in full if the defendants whose appearances they guarantee fail to appear on their trial date
[23:35:31] *** Quits: masoudd_ (~masoudd@user/masoudd) (Quit: Leaving)

[23:37:47] *** Quits: spinningCat (~spinningC@about/web/muscles) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:37:50] <blkshp> and the last statement.
[23:38:14] <blkshp> Do you see from that what it means?
[23:39:39] <blkshp> So if the defendants that the bondsmen have guaranteed don't turn up on their trial date they will pay the beil
[23:39:41] <blkshp> bail*
[23:39:55] <tony_hello> so  I understand this statement on its own "they guarantee fail to appear on their trial date"
[23:39:59] <tony_hello> and
[23:40:02] <tony_hello> "the appearances" is associated to "the defendants"
[23:40:24] <blkshp> There should be a comma after defendants
[23:41:26] <tony_hello> lol feel so dumb now that you said that
[23:41:28] <tony_hello> i*
[23:41:49] <blkshp> Not at all, it's a word that is rarely used outside of those legal documents
[23:42:00] <tony_hello> you are right the comma makes the difference for me now
