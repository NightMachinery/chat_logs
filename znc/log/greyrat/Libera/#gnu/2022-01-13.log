[00:18:46] <alextee[m]> is it allowed to load proprietary modules via a libre interface?
[00:18:56] <alextee[m]> at runtime
[00:19:26] <alextee[m]> I mean you don't really have control over it, but my question is more about, can you bundle software together with a nonfree library that can be loaded at runtime via a libre interface?
[00:19:35] <alextee[m]> and publish it like that?
[00:19:52] *** Joins: ozoned (odoood@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/odoood)
[00:20:09] <alextee[m]> is the fact that you are providing the module together with the gpl program a violation?

[01:08:03] *** Joins: layline (~layline@marsh.hcoop.net)
[01:09:30] <yrk> another point: it isn't the bundling that really matters; that's merely indicative. what matters more: is the GPL'd software designed to load that proprietary module? if so, then that proprietary module is likely a derivative and needs to be released under the GPL too, regardless of it is distributed separately. the critical question therefore is always "is it a derivative"?
[01:10:11] *** Quits: AnimalClatter (~AnimalCla@208.66.176.26) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[01:12:26] <yrk> ...and it devolves to this particular question because our licensing is currently based on copyright law, and derivative works is a critical aspect of copyright law. this isn't a particularly good way to think about combining bits of software (copyright law predates software, and wasn't designed for it), but it is how we have to think about it nevertheless; like it or not

[01:27:24] <alextee[m]> yrk: thanks for the l inks they're very interesting
[01:27:38] <alextee[m]> I think the difference in what I'm referring to is the type of interface
[01:28:01] <alextee[m]> if the interface is something generic that is implemented by various libraries (like a collection of main-like functions which make up the API)
[01:28:17] <alextee[m]> then it sounds like you can get away with it
[01:28:39] <alextee[m]> but if the interface is targeting a specific proprietary module only, even if you only load it at runtime if present, then yes that is closer to a violation
[01:28:59] <alextee[m]> like you can just dlopen a proprietary module and run its functions
[01:29:12] <alextee[m]> that feels closer to a violation
[01:29:27] <alextee[m]> but if there is an established standard interface what happens then?
[01:29:53] <alextee[m]> the program isn't designed to work with the proprietary functionality explicitly, but it can support it if present
[01:31:13] <alextee[m]> and yes you're probably right, this could probably be outside the scope of what GNU can say about it
[01:31:23] <alextee[m]> and could just depend if courts think this makes it a derivative work
[01:32:14] <alextee[m]> maybe being a bit more explicit in the GPL license about such cases could help
[01:32:20] <alextee[m]> something to think about for gpl4 perhaps
[01:37:42] <alextee[m]> >However, the sum total of what you are doing is still tantamount to distributing one program which contains readline but is not under the GPL.
[01:37:58] <alextee[m]> I guess RMS would say it's still a violation if you distribute the programs together

[03:47:00] <bugweiser> Setp 21 1995, implement base64 for uuencode; sept 22 implement base64 for uudecode (according to the posix draft 11 from that time)
[03:47:03] <bugweiser> THANKS
[03:47:26] <omegatron> i'm too lazy now to check, if our own cluster holds older versions ... =D
[03:47:55] <omegatron> https://mirror.lyrahosting.com/slackware/slackware-4.0/source/a/bin/ for 4.1 from 1994
[03:49:36] <bugweiser> I can always dig further on that link perhaps. But that trivia is answered ( if I put it besides the changelog.2000, then that commit was just before the release of 4.1.8 or 4.1.9 (couse due to removal of information in the later version of the changelog, this version bump occurs in the same commit of Sept 23 1995)
[03:52:23] <bugweiser> I should get focusing on the main event/question now. Figure out if there was ANY version/release that created uuencoded filenames (instead of base64) and if there was ANY version that created hex-encoded filenames (and prefixed the filename with 'hex-encode:' and required the option -h to do so  (but right of the bat it seems that -h was in use for help/usage)
[03:52:31] <omegatron> https://ftp.st.ryukoku.ac.jp/pub/utils/archiver/shar-3.49.tar.gz   I guess that is before it was named sharutils

[04:02:28] <bugweiser> yes regarding interesting, though i've had to unfortunate luck to pick some gnu file-formats that are poooooooorly documented.. (for the tar file-format i'm still putting off the @MaNgleD@ files thing couse I have yet to find information about that one (apart from trying to uncover it from the source).
[04:04:10] <bugweiser> I *really* wish that (just based on what i've seen/worked on) gnu did a better job at documenting 'extensions' and other non posix variations they have had over the year in file-formats that users expect (when uninformed) to be fixed...

[04:05:34] <omegatron> eh, it's just that I'm used to this sort of work
[04:06:55] <bugweiser> I thought I was :) But I realize there is a big rift between digging back for dos/windows (often seems to lead to amiga and fred fish disks) versus digging in early 1980
[04:08:17] <omegatron> archive.org might also contain some old software files you are looking for

[05:04:18] <bugweiser> that 3.49 was pretty interesting to look at :). It had uuencode built-in for shar-usage but not exposed as seperate program. and it's the first non-output-table ENC method i've seen (apart from my own) that doesn't branch :)

[05:10:14] <bugweiser> my paralel 3_octet_in 4_octet_out needed an interim answer so I could do: c+(((0100-c)&0100)|040)

[05:15:12] <bugweiser> known :) (as you could see from my own method :), still thanks should I have not known :) )
[05:15:22] <omegatron> ok
[05:15:46] * bugweiser bummed at myself I missed that particualr method I just seen, i'm nicking that so I no longer need the interim answer :) )
[05:19:00] <omegatron> damn ..
[05:19:14] <bugweiser> ?
[05:19:44] <omegatron> I just realized it might be a good idea to introduce a enabled/disabled-field and therefore also checkbox in our CMS .. but that would mean 330 of them ..   -_-
[05:20:00] <omegatron> (because one for each CSS property)
[05:20:18] *** Joins: Zongva (~harjar@2001:464a:bacf:0:22cf:30ff:fe14:a936)
[05:20:32] <bugweiser> I don't know what CMS you are looking at :)
[05:20:34] <omegatron> *sigh*   ...  but I guess I don't have a choice
[05:20:44] <omegatron> it's our own, to manage our cluster
[05:22:03] <bugweiser> I read, 'for each CSS property'
[05:22:46] <omegatron> phpmyadmin/mariadb already showed me the finger, when I tried to naively create a table with 340 columns, with type of 'varchar' because of max. column length - had to change it to 'text'
[05:23:00] <bugweiser> it is some aid in writing content, where per element you want the user to be able to toggle css rules from a 330 entry list?
[05:23:32] <omegatron> no, it's a large matrix, divided into tabviews of course
[05:24:00] <omegatron> each property has its own row, with the value(s) and icons to show css compatibility
[05:25:11] <bugweiser> for the db side, what if you store a blob of: ceil(330/32), and that blob is just holding false/true flags bitwise ?  If js is an option this can also be supported in web-front-end.
[05:29:00] <omegatron> nah - too much effort
[05:29:07] <bugweiser> return uint32_array[index>>5] << index < 0
[05:29:32] <bugweiser> (note in js, the &31 on the leftshift you get for free)
[05:29:45] <bugweiser> that would return bool true false
[05:29:46] <bugweiser> k
[05:36:36] <bugweiser> so there is 330 rows (one per css property), and the remaining colums (per row) are different css versions?
[05:38:21] <omegatron> no, the css compatiblity stuff is in a different table, which has 330 records of  id, property, desktop.chrome, desktop.edge, mobile.samsung, etc. (one column for each client)
[05:38:25] <bugweiser> if yes, then perhaps you can also get away with noting the indexed css-version ranges: index_start_support_css_version TO idx_end_support_css_version
[05:39:05] <bugweiser> ah (nice data-set by the way :) )
[05:39:09] <omegatron> but the css rule table has (now)  id, media, selector, order, status, and then the 2 x 330 columns
[05:39:52] <bugweiser> ooof
[05:41:17] <omegatron> we tried another approach before, but that was too much of a hassle : id parentid key value
[05:41:41] <omegatron> only 4 columns, but the required logic ...  -_-
[05:42:05] <bugweiser> yeah..
[05:42:57] *** Quits: odoood (~odoood@2601:c8:c000:c4e0::6) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[05:44:55] <omegatron> the current approach may look like overkill, but since most fields will be null or are of type boolean ..   at least, now the association to the respective selector, media etc. is easy to derive
[05:46:27] <bugweiser> that can also be worth something.. And i assume the css rules table can be auto-generated.. So I guess, perhaps profile the increased memory usage in the browsers you care for (when using the pure css rules) ?
[05:47:19] <omegatron> besides i'm used to work with excel spreadsheets with many thousands of columns, so I think if the office programs can do it, the mariadb database should be able to handle it
[05:47:39] <bugweiser> agree :)
[05:49:21] <omegatron> the users who work with this cms backend-wise are advised to only work from desktop-pcs - the frontend users only receive the generated css rules/files anyway - I doubt there will be any memory, network or performance issues - our server is fast enough to handle that
[05:50:05] <bugweiser> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24275959/what-is-the-max-number-of-columns-per-table-for-mariadb   says 4096 columns per table
[05:50:18] <omegatron> good to know
[05:53:52] <omegatron> arrgn, I always forget, that css properties are american english ..
[05:54:05] <omegatron> it's 'overscroll-behavior', not 'overscroll-behaviour'
[05:54:55] <bugweiser> lol, not always :)  css color gray/grey for example 
[05:55:15] <omegatron> yes, the (svg) colors allow both (at least)
[05:58:01] <bugweiser> for shits 'n giggles: it took me quite some time to figure out the relation between 'positive about posix' and that according to posix specs since like forever, the 'expected pronounciation' is 'pahz-iks'. 
[05:58:51] <bugweiser> like much of the non-usa world I pronounce 'positive' with 'o' as in 'dog', not 'a' as in 'cat'. 
[05:59:29] <bugweiser> so I saw no link from 'positive' to 'pahz'  (i'd expected 'pohz').
[06:00:00] <bugweiser> now that I know, the 'joke' is that posix is supposed to be pronounced with a think usa-accent :)
[06:00:24] <bugweiser> s/think/thick/
[06:00:46] <omegatron> hmm, I always pronounced it as 'ex-pensive crap' (because, who wants to pay that large sum for a certification - just implement the stuff and good is)
[06:01:19] <omegatron> ;-)
[06:02:37] <bugweiser> i've been digging though the first years of the mail-archives regarding the first posix-spec.. (and obviously the latter/current posix specs). And to put it politely... i'm no longer that 'impressed'.. lol
[06:02:54] <bugweiser> at least as far as base-utilities goes...
[06:03:54] <bugweiser> even today it seems pretty disjoint with actual unix-like systems even from say.. 1987
