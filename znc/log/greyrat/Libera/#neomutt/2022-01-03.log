[15:13:59] <flatcap> happy new year to you too :-)
[15:25:22] <kushal> flatcap, how was the holidays?
[15:26:05] <flatcap> good thanks.  saw some of the family; ate too much; drank to much :-)
[15:26:22] <flatcap> get up to anything exciting, yourself?
[15:31:36] <kushal> flatcap, exciting no, but fighting to package one of my PySide2 app for mac :)

[16:51:27] <dcpurton> flatcap, good to be here!
[16:52:12] <flatcap> welcome :-)
[16:52:38] <flatcap> how many tests have you created so far?
[16:53:42] <dcpurton> Not that many. Enough to fix the memory leaks and crashes you found and then realise that there are hundreds of combinations :(
[16:53:54] <flatcap> very nice work you've done so far, btw
[16:54:26] <dcpurton> Ta
[16:54:44] <flatcap> you're welcome to create a repo for your test configs, e.g. `test-compose`
[16:55:56] <flatcap> (and lots of test emails too)
[16:57:16] <dcpurton> OK. I'll wait until I have a system that makes sense
[16:57:24] <flatcap> sure
[17:05:53] <dcpurton> Gah! It drew the tree wrong after randomly playing around with a large attachment list. But I have no idea what I did…
[17:06:55] <flatcap> :-(
[17:08:41] <dcpurton> At least it's nowhere near as buggy as the present implementation, which is very easy to break
[17:09:00] <flatcap> yeah
[17:15:30] <flatcap> I can't crash it, or get it to leak any more
[17:19:55] <dcpurton> I can
[17:20:40] <dcpurton> add three attachments; group middle two; tag 1 and last; group; postpone
[17:21:14] <dcpurton> (four attachments in total I mean)
[17:22:41] * flatcap tries
[17:23:05] <dcpurton> Getting the actx array in the right order is easy. Getting the body pointers right is a pain
[17:23:21] *** Joins: gabriel1 (~gabriel1@user/gabriel1)
[17:24:41] <flatcap> oh yes
[17:25:50] <dcpurton> BTW, if you find a way of getting the dump_graphviz functions working with --asan, that would be super useful. I have to re-configure and rebuild
[17:26:23] <flatcap> I don't think it's possible, but I don't understand why not...
[17:26:50] <flatcap> ASAN messes about with pointers in a way that freaks out my trivial graphviz functions
[17:27:40] <flatcap> some day, I'll investigate
[17:28:57] <dcpurton> is there something that will do `dump_graphviz_body()` or the like?
[17:29:10] <dcpurton> and take a body pointer rather than whole email
[17:30:40] <flatcap> not sure.  feel free to hack a solution
[17:31:13] <flatcap> I've certain dumped from compose before: https://flatcap.org/mutt/group/compose-email.svg
[17:31:47] <flatcap> [aside] which reminds me of a long-term todo item for Body pointers
[17:32:14] <dcpurton> Yeah, I use that one a lot. That's the one that is badly wrong when my grouping logic is faulty
[17:33:06] <flatcap> I'd like to kill Body->next, Body->parts and (probably) use a TAILQ Body->children
[17:39:20] <dcpurton> It is a very inconvenient data structure. But I don't have a CS background or anything. It's just OK, if you just have to move attachments around and delete them or read them in order. But even then if you delete an attachment you have to iterate through the whole lot just to find the previous one!
[17:40:48] <flatcap> urgh!
[17:42:05] <dcpurton> And once you nest them, it breaks my head
[17:42:11] <flatcap> hehe
[17:42:51] <flatcap> fixing Body would be a huge task.  I haven't really investigated what I'd need to do
[17:43:31] <flatcap> ideas welcome
[18:22:37] <flatcap> is it ok to push some debugging fixes?
[18:25:45] <dcpurton> sure
[18:26:17] <dcpurton> I just fixed the previous crash too
[18:26:37] <dcpurton> But I might got to bed. Bit late here
[18:27:04] <flatcap> great.  goodnight
[18:27:31] <flatcap> push your fix first
[18:27:44] <dcpurton> OK
[18:28:33] <flatcap> thanks.  I'll see what I can break by morning :-)

[19:02:29] <elshize> hey y'all, does anyone here use some tricks for faster search? I'd like to use maildir but also use something like notmuch (or another method) for faster search in the archive. I did find something online that allows that but it's a bit clunky; before hacking on that, I thought I'd ask if anyone has some tricks up their sleves for that.
[19:05:26] <jindraj> elshize: the neomutt notmuch integration is probably the best you can get. superpowerful, you can still use maildirs and in addition vfolder-from-query to fast searching your messages on demand. 
[19:19:58] <elshize> jindraj: thanks! I'm trying it out.
[19:23:07] <elshize> from the docs it seems that I should be able to have a virtual folder show up when I search (vfolder_format) along with others like Inbox or Sent, but I can't make it work. do you know if that's actually possible and if so what I might be missing?

[19:34:46] <jindraj> elshize: https://github.com/jindraj/dotfiles/blob/master/.neomutt/neomuttrc.mailboxes#L14-L55 here you can see a mix of mbox (local), maildir (sample) and notmuch almost all other
[19:36:07] <jindraj> also bind vfolder-from-query to some key like this: https://github.com/jindraj/dotfiles/blob/master/.neomutt/neomuttrc.bindings#L120
[19:36:56] <jindraj> then just hit the key you bound the function to, type your query and you'll got results in temporary notmuch mailbox.
[19:38:00] <Kinnison> Can anyone give me some guidance on setting up neomutt to auto-display text/html via something like w3m -dump if there's no text/plain part?

[19:42:51] <flatcap> Kinnison: the two commands you need are `auto_view` and `alternative_order` (plus mailcap entries)
[19:43:34] <flatcap> `auto_view text/html` tells neomutt to try to display that mime type automatically
[19:44:42] <flatcap> a `text/html` mailcap tells neomutt *how*. if the mailcap contains the flag `copiousoutput` that means NeoMutt will expect *text* output that it can display
[19:45:05] <flatcap> finally, alternative_order tells neomutt which types you prefer to look at

[20:56:35] <elshize> jindraj: thanks for the link. this will be very helpful. I've been analyzing it, and I still can't make the temp folder to show. it's weird because after search if I go up in sidebar, I can see I was moved to the bottom of the list, but the folder doesn't show... strange.
[20:58:13] <elshize> I'll keep investigating later, but if there's anyting you can think of I might be doing wrong, let me know. essentially everything seems to be working as expected, only the temp folder doesn't show in the sidebar...

[23:13:00] <jindraj> nice, are you abroad?
[23:13:15] <ngortheone> in a neighboring state, Oregon
[23:13:38] <ngortheone> same country, I don't like traveling far. Hate flying
[23:16:08] <ngortheone> I have a question for vim users that I am a little bit embarrassed to ask, because it seems so stupid and obvious... Do you use vim jindraj?
[23:16:34] <ngortheone> totally offtopic too

[23:35:55] <flatcap> hi ngortheone
[23:36:43] <ngortheone> Hey flatcap!
[23:37:31] <flatcap> what's your vim question?
[23:39:07] <ngortheone> so using vim for C development, I have a project with `"#include "bla.h` where bla.h is an external library. I want to jump to the declaration of the symbol located in that header. Say `do_blah(..)`
[23:39:22] <ngortheone> Ctags only work for things in the project
[23:39:44] <ngortheone> is there an easy way to navigate to an external symbol?
[23:39:46] <flatcap> you can have more than one `tags` files
[23:40:02] <flatcap> as root, I run ctags in /usr/include
[23:40:25] <flatcap> and also in /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/11/include/
[23:40:48] <flatcap> some of the "standard" headers live in the gcc package (not sure about clang)
[23:41:01] <ngortheone> ok, so then you need to tell vim that there exists a global tags file in addition to your project-local one
[23:41:11] <flatcap> in vim, I   set tags=tags,/usr/include/tags,/usr/lib/gcc...tags
[23:41:17] <flatcap> yes
[23:41:40] <flatcap> I only tend to enable the other two when I need them, else Ctrl-] can be a bit close
[23:41:46] <flatcap> a bit slow*
[23:42:09] <ngortheone> that is so simple! folks from neovim channel couldn't answer this, they say use LSP
[23:42:19] <ngortheone> but I felt like there has to be simpler way
[23:42:48] <flatcap> :-)
[23:43:19] <ngortheone> gcc stuff usually has manuals, so `K` works fine most of the time
[23:43:58] <flatcap> yeah, but sometimes it's useful to look up the value of a symbol
[23:44:50] <ngortheone> true
[23:45:47] <ngortheone> so if I have sources of libbla I can generate tags in the source repository of libbla, and use them in my project too
[23:46:18] <ngortheone> set tags=tags,/path/to/libbla/tags
[23:46:26] <ngortheone> so I have implementations too
[23:47:05] <flatcap> yeah
[23:51:29] <ngortheone> What are you plans for 2022 (for neomutt) ?
[23:52:22] <ngortheone> Also - have you reflected back on how much was done in 2021? Even from distance it feels like a lot
[23:52:46] <flatcap> dunno and no, not really - respectively :-)
[23:52:49] * flatcap thinks ...
[23:54:01] <ngortheone> "just go with the flow" approach
[23:54:15] <flatcap> :-)
[23:55:25] <ngortheone> maybe thats the right way, more and more I find that for opensource unpaid projects it is more important to stay motivated. For me plans feel like a burden sometimes.
[23:55:28] <flatcap> I need to focus and finish these tricky GUI improvements
[23:56:01] <ngortheone> Maybe the right question would be - what do you want to get done? what do you want to work on tomorrow?
[23:56:12] <flatcap> and I like how the switch {} -> op_xxx() functions conversions are going
[23:57:10] <flatcap> they open up the greater possibility of scripting
