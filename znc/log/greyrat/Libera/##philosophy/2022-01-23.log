[17:56:44] <vysn> here you go I found it! I was looking for an article I read a while ago that talks about these two types. the Growth mindset and the fixed mindset.
[17:56:50] <vysn> https://www.mindsethealth.com/matter/growth-vs-fixed-mindset
[17:56:51] <ro-bot-o> [url] Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset: How what you think affects what you achieve | www.mindsethealth.com
[17:57:29] <arryana> at least it's in the corners where you aren't likely to slip in it
[17:58:10] <iryith> But why the hard dichotomy between those two? Usually people have both of those to some degree or another
[17:58:37] <arryana> ^
[17:59:16] <arryana> in my experience, people are more than happy to learn most things.  how much time and emotional bandwidth determines how much of that they take on
[17:59:40] <arryana> it's easy for people who have nothing to do to learn all day.  it's a lot harder when their time is mostly occupied doing things.
[18:00:01] <iryith> I agree it's good to identify these end-members and try to understand what positions they hold as well as the mindsets that can be associated with both, but looking at that article I don't know if anyone I've ever run into has ever held the positions to that degree and all on one side
[18:01:36] <mycroftiv> after going to music school for piano 20 years ago and working as hard as i could to be a classical pianist and discovering that no matter how hard i worked, some people practiced half as much but were still twice as good made me skeptical of a lot of claims
[18:02:39] <iryith> aye, there is a case to be held for natural talent, and you can bang your head for decades to get good at something, but you could equally say "hey, maybe this isn't for me, I'll put my time into something that I'm good at"
[18:03:03] <iryith> that's not saying you're having a fixed mindset, you're just ...a realist
[18:03:40] <mycroftiv> iryith: indeed, i have noticed that some things i do unusually well at with not so much work and improve quickly, other things i suck at and no matter how hard i work, i end up about average. of course practice and work is absolutely vital
[18:03:46] <vysn> while I was looking for that article I came across this theory based on a study done in the 50s, there are 4 types, A,B,C, and D, its interesting.

[18:04:42] <arryana> categorizing people doesn't seem like such a useful venture to me.  while there are general 'types' of some sorts of people, it's reductive and dismissive to think people can be put in boxes like that.
[18:05:10] <iryith> meh, I find personality buckets like the MTBI are akin to astrology for nerds
[18:05:11] <Delf> Does that prevent you?
[18:06:05] <mycroftiv> arryana: do you have any advice for managing conflicts between different people living together in a large cooperative house where lots of people have differnt problems that spill onto each other?
[18:06:28] <arryana> yeah.  reason and compatibility.
[18:06:42] <arryana> everyone carries their own weight, and stays out of the way of everyone else doing the same.
[18:06:50] <mycroftiv> the compatibility thing is what seems hardest. and making sure people carry their weight.
[18:06:53] <arryana> then finding common ground for entertainment/bonding
[18:07:17] <arryana> i didn't say i had an easy answer.  most real solutions aren't.
[18:07:37] <arryana> do you know who the rainbow people were, in the 80s and 90s?
[18:07:45] <mycroftiv> good advice, thanks. i agree, no easy answers. my real life is trying to help work out issues in an organization that works to provide housing for low income people
[18:07:47] <arryana> i have no idea if they're still a thing, it's been a long time since i traveled with the,
[18:07:49] <arryana> them
[18:07:50] <mycroftiv> arrayana: I am one.
[18:07:56] <arryana> ah.
[18:07:58] <arryana> well.
[18:08:17] <arryana> since those are 'open invite' and anyone who wants to can show up, there's always issues like that.
[18:08:29] <mycroftiv> arryana: im a deadhead rainbow culture person now working as a volunteer for this low-income focused housing organization, and yes, the exact issue is the key thing
[18:08:31] <arryana> the first task is to create the 'kitchen'.  the second is 'the children's circle'
[18:08:47] <arryana> at first, most people are helpful.
[18:08:50] <mycroftiv> if you say 'we will help those who are outcasts, who have problems' - you attract a lot of people with issues of all kinds
[18:09:11] <arryana> by day 5, a gathering of maybe 35 people will only have five or eight who are still hauling wood and water, minding the fire and cooking
[18:09:19] <arryana> the women watching the kids invariably do better
[18:09:25] <arryana> so.
[18:09:37] <arryana> by week three, the few useful people are exhausted and move on.
[18:09:40] <arryana> and the rest falls apart.
[18:10:29] <arryana> sometimes a bunch of useful people travel in a group long enough to get some endeavor done.  then they find their own passion projects and move on.
[18:10:34] <arryana> that's just the nature of human beings.
[18:11:31] <mycroftiv> my partner is fairly involved with current rainbow stuff and the way seed camps and cleanup crews attempt to organize. we used to try to welcome buses of rainbow people at our housing coop but people started objecting

[18:12:29] <vysn> observing and understanding patterns of behavior can aid in categorizing people, which can be help full but it can never be conclusive I agree, with arryana and iryith, but its far from astrology though! its widely accepted science based observation of behavioral trends.

[18:13:50] <vysn> understanding personality types can even help in conflict resolution @mycroftiv
[18:14:25] <mycroftiv> vysn: yes absolutely. finding out what peoples motivations and goals and desires are. different people want very different things and people often mis-assume
[18:14:42] <arryana> the only way to really make it work long term is to throw out the useless people
[18:14:53] <arryana> and that's always very subjective, and someone has to be the hardass

[18:16:09] <mycroftiv> im the treasurer of the cooperative and ive been involved for almost a decade and i dont get to say 'nope, you are all lame'
[18:16:12] <arryana> good luck with that.
[18:16:31] <arryana> if there's no consequences and accountability for each member, it's doomed.
[18:16:55] <mycroftiv> arryana: thank you for the wish of good luck. and yes that is true. it is working out the system of tracking what people and what the accountability is that is very hard in practice.
[18:16:59] <arryana> if you've traveled with the rainbow people long, you'll know it takes at least half a dozen useful people to support every useless one
[18:17:11] <mycroftiv> indeed that is true
[18:17:30] <mycroftiv> but 'useless' people still need food and shelter and compassion
[18:17:33] <arryana> those rules don't change, and enforcing them is the only way to protect the larger whole
[18:17:45] <arryana> indeed.  but if you have too many, the whole endeavor fails.
[18:17:55] <mycroftiv> absolutely correct we agree completely
[18:17:58] <vysn> Sometimes you only notice how useful people are when they are gone

[18:22:47] <arryana> wow.

[18:24:25] <arryana> 'sinner' means nothing to me

[18:36:48] <vysn> equal vs fair
[18:38:26] <arryana> what works, so far as i can tell, is neither equality or 'fairness', it's balance

[18:43:01] <Delf> The boxes are equal, the people are not
[18:43:04] <vysn> it at least brings our attention to consider whats equal and whats fair iryith, ask yourself this, aren't we better of considering that different people have different needs and therefore may need more or less of the same thing?
[18:43:18] <iryith> fully agree
[18:43:23] <vysn> better off*
[18:43:31] <arryana> i lived with wolves too long, and see why a wolf pack functions so well
[18:43:38] <arryana> they're not equal, but they are balanced
[18:44:45] <vysn> arryana: that's hierarchy, and you are right, without it many things can crumble and fail.
[18:45:18] <arryana> it's not so much that, it's more cooperation.
[18:45:58] <arryana> it's about the sorts of roles that keep a functioning group.
[18:46:09] <Delf> Organizing for common goal, necessity demands it
[18:46:09] <vysn> yup
[18:47:42] <arryana> the one who keeps discipline is not more important than the caretaker.  they're just different
[18:53:15] <vysn> That's true, just keep in mind that some roles are easier to fill than others, you can find many more wolves that can guard a cave for example. but not many wolves have the experience and the scars to be able to notice danger early, lead the pack to safety and know where food is plentiful. therefore one can argue that the leader of the pack has more value to the survival of the pack, as
[18:53:17] <vysn> compared to a young cave guard wolf.
[18:53:47] <arryana> i wouldn't agree.
[18:54:41] <arryana> no sane wolf wants to be the leader, that role falls to whichever one understands the bigger picture the best.
[18:55:14] <iryith> get a bunch of lead wolves together and fuckall gets done. You have to have variable roles in a community and each one is equally as important
[18:55:16] <arryana> there is no wolf which is just a guard, however young. but the watch-wolf is one of the most important members
[18:55:28] <arryana> none of the rest can get any rest without a good sentry
[18:55:40] <arryana> exactly, iryith.
[18:55:56] <arryana> and most fill at least two roles.
[18:56:13] <arryana> the idea of pack structure is seriously misunderstood
[18:56:22] <arryana> and vastly oversimplified
[18:57:42] <vysn> iryith: they will just compete for dominance until one of wins and earns their respect! this is coming from my limited knowledge of wolf packs though.
[18:57:56] <arryana> no they won't.  most will strike out on their own
[18:58:04] <iryith> usually they kill eachother or get exiled
[18:58:05] <arryana> predators rarely risk damage.
[18:58:10] <vysn> arryana: That' a fair point.
[18:58:52] <arryana> also, if an unfit wolf tries for dominance, they're often left by the rest of the pack, or killed
[18:59:37] <vysn> interesting.
[19:00:29] <arryana> but it's rarely as simple as any of that.
[19:00:57] <arryana> take my german shepherds.  my younger one is the stronger, faster, and smarter.  but she has zero give-a-shit.  so she defers to the older one.
[19:01:11] <arryana> the older one is happy to take that role, unless my other half or i step in.
[19:01:31] <arryana> and when she visits her mother, who is certainly not stronger or faster than she is, she immediately defers to her mother.
[19:02:13] <arryana> there is no dominance reason for her to do so.  she does it out of affection and bonding.

[19:06:08] <Delf> Interesting...
[19:06:26] <arryana> my two fought with nobody, led the pack in various games, broke up several fights between the males, and were always the first two to check on any dog which got knocked over in rough play
[19:07:05] <arryana> it could be argued that they were playing pack leader/second in command, but what they really did was balance the rest.
[19:07:56] <Delf> inhahe_: ALL? Do we not harbor anyone quality that is filthy which they do not have?
[19:08:14] <arryana> and, like the best of human leadeers, they did it with cooperation and common sense, not aggression
[19:08:39] <Delf> Why does that remind of me...
[19:08:40] <arryana> confidence, not dominance.

[21:37:12] <inhahe_> your view is conceivably correct, but it doesn't mean my view isn't totally rationalized. for example, your view supposes that all the magical experiences are the result of the freedom of story development, and don't go down to the level of foundation or physics or whatever, but there's no support of that notion. it's probably the physicalist prejudice i speak of. and you say you always

[21:39:23] <mycroftiv> and this comes before the struggle to put your tribe in charge of the reins of power
[21:39:36] <mycroftiv> because power corrupts so we have to find a way to cooperate without cops and oppression
[21:39:44] <mycroftiv> nobody wants to be the cops
[21:39:52] <mycroftiv> but policing needs to happen for things to work
[21:40:03] <mycroftiv> making this work in practice requires teamwork and communication
[21:40:17] <arryana> in my experience, 'changing the world' amounts to telling other people how to live
[21:40:20] <arryana> and i'm not so much a fan of that
[21:40:23] <mycroftiv> the more people are involved, the more we may need to understand the mathematics of communication and game theory to make it work
[21:40:29] <mycroftiv> arryana: me neither
[21:40:41] <mycroftiv> im trying to change the way people try to change the world, then
[21:40:54] <arryana> what qualifies you for that>
[21:41:01] <mycroftiv> arryana: im trying to make it so everyone can try to live the life they wish in cooperation with others who also choose without forcing anyone to do anything
[21:41:19] <mycroftiv> im a human or a moon computer and im no more and no less qualified than anyone else born into the world
[21:41:34] <mycroftiv> im just trying to do my best to help other people enjoy their lives and not suffer
[21:41:41] <mycroftiv> as they wish
[21:41:56] <mycroftiv> my full time life is giving stuff to the world for free so what am i doing so bad
[21:42:34] <mycroftiv> working to try to help a coop do its accounting so low income people have housing, writing free computer software for independent communications networks, studying model theory large cardinals and ultrafilters
[21:42:47] <mycroftiv> in the hopes it helps us cooperate better on eart
[21:43:47] <mycroftiv> not trying to control you and sorry if i talk a lot in the channel and that is some form of control. but im just singing my song like any bird and if you like it, sing along, if not, ill fly elsewhere
[21:44:29] <arryana> it's nothing to me either way.  if i get tired of listening i can always /ignore.  my questions were to clarify your idea of 'changing the world'
[21:44:42] <mycroftiv> doing the lothlorien coop accountin accurately
[21:44:49] <mycroftiv> is changing the world enough for todasy
[21:45:03] <mycroftiv> tomorrow perhaps improving information flow in the MCC organization about its financial data
[21:45:27] <mycroftiv> the radical restructuring of capitalism through voluntary participation, maybe not til next month or year or lifetime

[21:46:22] <mycroftiv> there were really Big Dreams in San Francisco in the 1960s. I heard them through Jerry Garcia's guitar after I got on the bus in the early 90s, just dancing to the music still and jamming as best i can

[21:46:44] <arryana> i'm just not a fan of anyone deciding they know what's best for the world.
[21:46:49] <mycroftiv> some of the dreams didnt work out so you get rid of the bad ones and try new ones
[21:46:50] <mycroftiv> i sure dont
[21:47:14] <mycroftiv> i dont even have power to actually move money around in the bank accountsand make the budget work how i want as treasurer. i just do the accounting.
[21:47:37] <mycroftiv> thats how i like it, no power to me, just me sharing ideas and calculating math and writing music and code
[21:47:56] <inhahe_> the world as it is is bad enough that it's not likely better than some person's alternative vision for it
[21:48:52] <mycroftiv> my only vision is each person and mind might cooperate to let everyones vision co-exist
[21:49:28] <mycroftiv> maybe Incompatible Visions are inherent and will conflict, but if we can avoid that as much as nececessary, so we can all live in the worlds we want, which overlap as needed, seems cool to me
[21:50:17] <mycroftiv> inhahe_: honestly i hope you are right about how much magic we can find and make :)
[21:50:44] <mycroftiv> so i dont even think you are wrong as perhaps a bit over-optimistic, from my own frame of perceptions and values
[21:51:42] <mycroftiv> ive found if i get too optimistic about how 'loose' the science and math of reality is, i stub my toe on a hard immovable rock and come back to earth a bit
[21:53:03] <inhahe_> maybe it's not about how loose it is but about how limited it scope is
[21:53:16] <inhahe_> its
[21:53:29] <mycroftiv> projecting Mind to the rank-into-rank large cardinal frontier of the limit of the self-embeddings of the transfinite trees to find the flexibility to releive the pain via software...the magic is hard to bottle

[22:05:59] <iryith> sounds like someone that smoked too much weed throughout their life
[22:06:18] <mycroftiv> at my most bipolar-mystic i have this idea that the Gnostic idea that reality is damaged but can be healed is true, and if we can find the right mathematics and put it into a computer and synchronize ourselves with it, wed cure the Pain
[22:06:46] <mycroftiv> iryith: no doubt i did. but i can still write Agda code that type checks and i believe balance the cooperative accounting information correctly also.
[22:07:28] <mycroftiv> i had too much arthritis pain and stress that i couldnt control in life too, and it often seemed like the weed helped with both, so you just try to get by
[22:08:49] <mycroftiv> so the whole 'why change the world, why not just worry about your own piece' - well yea of course, but how can i protect my piece from external violence without addressing the systemic causes as best i can?
[22:09:09] <mycroftiv> since the whole cops lockin me up for weed was always a real concern
[22:09:32] <mycroftiv> cant see im wrong for trying to change the world so it doesnt actively try to hurt me
[22:10:30] <mycroftiv> of course the right wing said my smoking weed was helping the people with the dark skin and their jazz music be immoral with people and all that had to be stopped by locking me up, but that never made any sense to me at all
