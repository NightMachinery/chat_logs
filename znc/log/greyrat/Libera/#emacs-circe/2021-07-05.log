[19:40:34] <ngz> Hello. I'm happily using a global non-empty wrap-prefix in Circe buffers. However, I'd like to set it to the empty string on the input line. I tried to add '(wrap-prefix "" front-sticky t) to circe-prompt-string, but it doesn't seem to work. Would you have another idea?
[19:42:23] <ngz> I might try to do it the other way: set a global empty wrap-prefix (i.e., no wrap-prefix) and propertizing both `circe-format-say' and `circe-format-self-say' to include a non-nil one.
[19:44:28] <ngz> No, it failed =/
[19:47:44] <ngz> Hmmm, maybe with lui-post-output-hookâ€¦
[19:54:52] <ngz> It seems to work.
[19:57:51] <ngz> It might be worth describing this setup in the wiki instead of hard-setting `wrap-prefix' property in `lui-mode-hook'.
[19:58:27] <ngz> It is prettier, and it illustrates `lui-post-output-hook'.
[20:00:51] <ngz> (in the "Fluid-width windows" section)
[20:01:22] <wasamasa> are you absolutely sure it handles all cases the other setup does?
[20:02:01] <wasamasa> because, yes, I consider the wrap-prefix solution far from ideal
[20:02:22] <ngz> The documented setup adds "  " everywhere. My suggestion adds "  " to every text that goes through `lui-post-output-hook'.
[20:02:42] <ngz> So, I guess it means my suggestion adds "  " everywhere but the input line.
[20:03:28] <ngz> Of course, this could be refined, e.g., by ignoring server-side messages too.
[20:03:53] <ngz> But it's a start.
[20:04:11] <wasamasa> why don't you use that setup for a while and figure out those kinks over a few days or so
[20:04:26] <ngz> Sure. I intend to use it for a while.
[20:07:18] <ngz> Reloading Emacs to be sure my set-up is used everywhere, brb.

[20:12:43] <ngz> test
[21:18:28] <ngz> Interestingly, Circe seems to add a invisible space character in front of topic line (when calling /topic) even though `circe-format-server-topic' doesn't specify this.
[21:19:04] <ngz> It doesn't happen on /names, for example.
[21:21:54] <ngz> Oh, and it's unrelated to `circe-format-server-topic'.
[21:22:17] <ngz> There's no variable behind it, so I guess this is a plain server message.
[21:24:58] <ngz> (I hope nobody minds my rambling)
