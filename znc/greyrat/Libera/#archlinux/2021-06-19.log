[00:05:41] <jaawerth> mkoskar: I made a wrong assumption somewhere - I just know I *had* dig on this machine, and now I do not, but I *do* have drill as a dep of ldns
[00:05:56] <jaawerth> but whatever the reason, it wasn't that
[00:06:39] <mkoskar> yep, drill is part of ldns, dig is part of bind

[04:24:19] <Repentinus> SponiX, the main downside is that the installer is fairly rigid in the scenarios it supports.
[04:25:10] <Repentinus> So it's generally worth doing it without the installer, so you know what to do when stuff breaks or you need a customization not handled by the installer.

[11:39:27] <zipper> Hello, a bit of a n00b issue. So I just formatted a flash drive like so `sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda1` and labelled with with sudo e2label /dev/sda1 <name>
[11:39:52] <zipper> Problem is now I have to be root to mount the flash drive
[11:40:00] <zipper> *to write to the flash drive
[11:40:24] <zipper> I am letting gnome handle the mounting of the flash drive and all
[11:40:28] <mpan> zipper: to mount or to write to it?
[11:40:36] <zipper> mpan: To write to it
[11:40:36] <another> shem: No. I was all ready to push the reset pin and on a whim pushed the power button. Turned right off. Turned it back on. Booted like normal.
[11:41:16] <another> I then updated the firmware like all the other times before: By dd'ing the iso to USB
[11:41:25] <mpan> zipper: I thought udisks should mount with an option allowing anyone to access anything. But before that is solved (no idea it is not mounted that way), you can chmod the root directory to 777.

[11:46:45] <mpan> No, permissions are stored in the filesystem.
[11:47:02] <mpan> You literally have the root directory set to be owned by root:root and 755 probably.
[11:47:45] <mpan> And ext filesystems retain ownership/permissions while mounted. This is one of the downsides for using them for media like USB sticks, used to transfer between computers.

[13:01:53] <WinterStar> Since it's not the job of mkinitcpio of course to also sign the package, perhaps the pacman hook could simply be adjusted to sign the unified kernel image as well, for example via:

[14:25:02] <WinterStar> Some last remarks about IWD: technically it should be possible to have IWD work without resolved in the end. Also, if you want to use a special DNS server, or perhaps a caching resolver on localhost, you can simply specify that in the /var/lib/iwd/<accesspointname>.psk file 
[14:26:39] <WinterStar> Also, note that IWD will only do DHCP for Wireless adapters, so if in a couple of months from now you would hook the notebook up to a wired network to discover that the link doesn't seem to work, remember that you'd indeed have to enable dhcpcd for the wired interface(s) on your system to be assigned an IP address ;)

[14:36:15] <whatsthecraic> WinterStar: I am actually thinking to remove grub altogether, and manage the boot priority through the bios

[14:36:31] <WinterStar> daria: probably, but be sure to do 'sudo pacdiff' to check for all the configuration file changes that have been made since your last update as well, and of course news on  the front page regarding manual interventions first
[14:37:23] <WinterStar> whatsthecraic: you could do that, or use a more simple bootloader like systemd-boot (gummuiboot).
[14:37:51] <WinterStar> I switched to this recently and it's nice. Also, it's easier to have automatically updated with an update of systemd.
[14:38:09] <daria> then on another system i nuked it to the point that it would no longer boot past the syslinux screen by removing conflicting system packages, would chroot still be an option?
[14:38:11] <WinterStar> Is your machine bios or uefi though?
[14:38:18] <whatsthecraic> WinterStar: uefi
[14:39:23] <WinterStar> daria: there's nearly always a way to recover any system. But it might seem like untangling a large ball of yarn, depending on the situation ;)
[14:41:12] <WinterStar> whatsthecraic: check the settings for secure boot. If you either update grub or switch to systemd boot the bootloader might have to be signed with the db.key for the systme
[14:41:12] <mpan> daria: I second WinterStar. While normally fixing is promoted over reinstalling, in that case it would be a tedious work of doing small updates step by step, offering little advantage over reinstalling and having the disadvantage of accepting unsigned packages.
[14:42:28] <mpan> daria: as for the other system, if it’s not borked because of being old — yes, fixing is preferred. :)
[14:42:45] <mpan> daria: this way you will learn what you have done wrong and will avoid it in the future.
[14:43:05] <daria> i assume i removed something from the core section of packages
[14:43:24] <daria> so next time im around i'll chroot off usb and diagnose
[14:43:49] <daria> also was having trouble with disk space due to the system partition of 20GB being full
[14:43:55] <WinterStar> daria: then it sounds like you could chroot in and just reinstall that, but be careful not to partially update your system
[14:44:13] <mpan> Arch should run having only the base package (and its deps), at least one core and one boot manager. Everything else, core or not, should normally be optional.
[14:44:29] <WinterStar> ^
[14:44:55] <mpan> 20GB is too small, however. Unless you are willing to put a lot of effort into keeping things small, but that effort is really pointless IMO.
[14:44:58] <Namarrgon> you probably want a kernel, too
