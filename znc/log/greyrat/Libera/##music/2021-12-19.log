[05:03:22] <artao> ya really need to do something every once in awhile to take a break and re-engage your brain
[05:03:50] <artao> cuz it really is mindless. can't think about what you're typing, just type it. then check that it's right
[05:04:09] <artao> thinking makes you slower and causes more mistakes
[05:05:15] <artao> same with touch typing, but for me that's more seeing individual words, not letters .. wheras data entry is just single number by single number

[06:10:20] <artao> LOL not possible :P
[06:10:43] <zenema> Maybe the teeth grinding is creating the unpleasant frequencies? Hahaha
[06:10:44] <artao> thankfully i can largey EQ those down with my mixer
[06:11:12] <artao> like scratching a chalkboard, but a wider and lower freq. range
[06:11:29] <artao> like ... 5000 to 10000hz, especially if there's sibilants
[06:11:32] <zenema> I've never understood why people find that so disturbing (chalk-board)
[06:11:50] <artao> ah. fair nuf
[06:12:08] <artao> as i've long said: The universe has a resonant frequency and it annoys me sometimes.
[06:12:30] <zenema> Ahaha, yes, this can be a problem with not being asleep ;D
[06:13:02] <artao> lol
[06:13:24] <artao> it's not uncommon for me to hear a deep DEEP hum, sometimes even throbbing, that most other people say they can't hear
[06:14:00] <artao> and not just "in my ears" like ear ringing
[06:14:13] <artao> for instance, when the train is coming by
[06:14:31] <artao> obvsiouly other people hear the train, but not that DEEEEP throbbing sound its engine makes
[06:15:08] <artao> i can start hearing my speakers around 35hz .... stop hearing them around 14.5khz, but i know they go higher cuz my cats can hear them and let me know they're very annoyed by it
[06:15:09] <artao> LOL
[06:15:36] <zenema> Ahaha, poor kitties! You should probably avoid that for their sake!

[06:16:08] <zenema> Oi ;)
[06:16:36] <artao> oh, i genrally do. sometimes when doing sound exploration tho they synths or whatever make freq. higher than i can hear
[06:17:33] <zenema> The weirdest audio effect I've ever experienced was a result of playing around with dual sine waves on headphones whilst experimenting with binaural beats..
[06:18:01] <zenema> That left me with a terrible distortion on some normal sounds, which sounded very much like they were being filtered through the sound of running water.

[07:03:58] <artao> i've actually started shaving my armpits. JUCH easier to keep clean, and less smelly in general
[07:04:04] <artao> why do we even HAVE armpit hair?
[07:04:09] <artao> and crotch hair for that matter
[07:04:27] <artao> hair on the rest of the body serves as insulation and bug protection (to a degree)
[07:04:27] <artao> mk

[07:05:55] <artao> IN FACT
[07:06:24] <artao> what evolutionary purpose does it serve to have longer crotch and armpit hair than on the rest of the body (except the head) and why is it a different type of hair?
[07:06:46] <artao> okay .... main blood vessels are both under your armpit and in your crotch
[07:06:52] <artao> so ... heat?
[07:07:09] <artao> but that makes no sense, cuz those areas are already usually pretty closed and maintain heat pretty well

[07:23:09] <artao> o.O
[07:23:13] <artao> missing .......?
[07:23:24] <artao> foam cover? wind screen?
[07:23:28] <artao> you can get a pack with that
[07:23:36] <artao> it doesn't even come with a cable
[07:23:59] <louipc> yea the bellend
[07:24:04] <artao> yeah
[07:24:06] <artao> not needed
[07:24:38] <artao> especially not for instruments. that thing is for voice use and conditions with a breeze
[07:24:48] <artao> tho for THAT you'd likely want a ... hairy thing
[07:25:16] <louipc> i already have a hairy thing
[07:26:31] <artao> that doesn't work to block wind noise
[07:26:46] <artao> SM57 is only 100 bucks. SUPER cheap
[07:26:51] <artao> and industry standard studio mic
[07:27:00] <artao> any decent studio will have several of them
[07:27:23] <artao> the SM58 is more for vocals and includes a high pass filter due to that intent
[07:27:34] <artao> the sm57 is better for general use, but also vocals
[07:27:39] <artao> no HP filter
[07:28:24] <louipc> how high u plan on singing
[07:28:43] <artao> oh, 40 or 50 khz
[07:28:50] <louipc> nioce
[07:28:57] <artao> with my tightly clenched butt sphincter
[07:29:00] <artao> :P
[07:29:01] <artao> no
[07:29:30] <artao> piano, trumpet, harmonica, acoustic guitar, flute, field recording ....
[07:29:49] <artao> sure, vocals too. but i don't use a lot of vocals, and i already have a foam windscreen and a pop-filter
[07:29:57] <louipc> i knew some broke ass guy who bought a 300$ mic long ass time ago
[07:30:06] <louipc> and i was here with a $30 one heuheue
[07:30:08] <artao> the SM57 is popular in, like ... radio and overdubs and such
[07:30:12] <artao> the SM58 more for singing
[07:30:17] <artao> i don't do much singing
[07:30:21] <louipc> dont even know what mic it was
[07:30:35] <artao> it really does make a difference, the mic
[07:30:42] <louipc> he didnt even sing tho just growl/screaming
[07:30:50] <louipc> so i was thinking like whats the point 
[07:30:57] <louipc> in noisy bars

[07:44:53] <artao> detail
[07:44:59] <artao> the better the input, the better the output
[07:47:04] <artao> even if you're processing THE SHIT out of it
[07:47:18] <artao> okay
[07:47:24] <artao> a few more porn vids then off to the bar
[07:47:33] <louipc> lol nah detail gets completely lost
[07:47:49] <artao> it does indeed
[07:47:59] <artao> but it's important that it's there for the processing
[07:48:16] <artao> that's why you do 32-bit float processing even tho no human could hear the difference
[07:48:28] <artao> it's the final outcome that matters, where all that adds up
[07:48:59] <artao> try it in 24/16/8-bit and the end result can be noticeably ... diffrent
[07:50:55] <louipc> what if i used it to vibrate a big metal plate then mic that
[07:52:08] <artao> um
[07:52:13] <artao> depends what you're going for
[07:52:29] <artao> that's basically a plate reverb, and the standard for that is a contact mic on the plate
[07:52:45] <artao> well wait
[07:52:48] <louipc> dats hot
[07:52:53] <artao> using what to vibrate what then record what?
[07:53:05] <louipc> idno
[07:53:35] <artao> with both spring and plate reverb three's a "speaker" of a sort that causes the spring/plate to vibrate then there's a pickup(s) to hear THAT then send it out
[07:53:57] <artao> obviously, you can't use contact mic on springs ........ so i'm honesltly not exactly sure HOW they do that LOL
