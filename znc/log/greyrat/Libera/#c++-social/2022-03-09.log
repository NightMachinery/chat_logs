[00:19:37] <LordKalma> according to twitter it was "person convicted of rape and possession of Child Sexual Abuse Imagery" that had "full access to CppCon as an attendee, speaker and trainer" and "is well-known and trusted in the C++ community". I saw this and imagined #include<c++> would be going haywire. Well, with good reason anyway.

[00:23:28] <T`aZ> no shit
[00:24:14] <PJBoy> no shit what?
[00:24:15] <T`aZ> this smells like sjw all over again drama

[00:25:19] <PJBoy> ok I kinda respect that
[00:25:30] <T`aZ> whatever a person has done, however how bad it is, should not be known to the public. There is a right to privacy
[00:25:31] <rpav> i doubt it, though
[00:25:43] <T`aZ> is that person not in prison ? good, next topic
[00:25:57] <PJBoy> oh you'll be happy to know they absolutely refuse to reveal any details about this person then
[00:26:21] <rpav> "anti-censorship" tends to be a euphemism for "i don't care about this thing" and somehow turn into "but censoring that is ok because i don't agree with it"
[00:26:26] <PJBoy> (as in identifiable information)
[00:26:42] <T`aZ> rpav: no, i dont agree with any kind of censorship
[00:27:11] <rpav> but privacy is censorship of personal information ;)
[00:28:05] <T`aZ> meh, kinda agree and not agree
[00:28:21] <rpav> life is complicated
[00:28:31] <T`aZ> we know need to define what is censorship, information, privacy
[00:28:36] <LordKalma> wow who'd say real life is nuanced
[00:28:37] <T`aZ> im not going to do that :p
[00:28:54] <T`aZ> w/know/now/
[00:29:08] <rpav> but that said, i think if you did the crime and you did the time, then you have a right to move on, assuming you're not lately actively participating in similar 
[00:29:22] <T`aZ> indeed, that's was my point
[00:29:37] <PJBoy> that assumes that doing the time has any effect on someone
[00:29:51] <PJBoy> also I tend to agree
[00:30:02] <PJBoy> it's not like cppcon attracts unsupervised children
[00:30:15] <T`aZ> that's a justice problem, not a 'I, as a citizen, need to take justice into my own hand, because I know better'
[00:30:26] <rpav> (probably jail doesn't reform people, but i think people can be reformed)
[00:30:35] <PJBoy> well in this case it's include C++ people who are connected to cppcon
[00:31:11] <PJBoy> although I honestly haven't read the details
[00:31:28] <PJBoy> there are far too many words for a small amount of information

[14:31:52] <Carbonflux> yup
[14:32:41] <Carbonflux> people like that money and shortage thing.
[14:36:59] <MaNI> if they really wanted to solve it they should think outside the box and add things to the cards that gamers can still use but that have no use to the miners, like bundle 4tb of data storage on them or something IDK
[14:38:23] <Carbonflux> i agree, this whole thing is a failure of imagination.
[14:38:47] <MaNI> or yeah in the case of AMD they can just ditch discrete cards entirely and pump out apus or whatever, change form factors into something where its no longer convenient to buy and put a dozen of them on a single motherboard
[14:39:19] <Carbonflux> gaming laptops
[14:39:23] <MaNI> I think they quite like the situation though
[14:39:33] <Renderwww> aren't some shitcoins memory bound?
[14:39:38] <Raziel> except for all the gamers that don't give a fuck about 4tb of cloud data and don't wanna pay extra for that, while the miners would just add some time to their expected return?
[14:39:42] <Carbonflux> ya, they are printing money at Nvidia.
[14:39:56] <MaNI> and these "we will cripple mining on the card" changes that are easily worked around are just a token effort to satisfy the whingiest gamers
[14:40:06] <Raziel> and APUs are obviously far more limited than dedicated gpus, they won't touch the mid and high end
[14:40:21] <Renderwww> steam deck is the future, no mine wants to pay for a battery, a display and a controller
[14:40:25] <MaNI> not cloud data, like an actual SSD type thing ;) 
[14:40:26] <Renderwww> *miner
[14:40:58] <Raziel> MaNI, I guess there's already retailers only selling stuff in bundle deals like that
[14:40:59] <MaNI> Renderwww, sure memory bound GPU proof is completely possible, I've even written it, its just that people choose to support the GPU ones
[14:41:00] <Raziel> idk how much it helps
[14:41:03] <MaNI> so thats the other option
[14:41:23] <Raziel> remember when chia coin was "THE SHIT", and hdd prices were completely fucked for like 6 months?
[14:41:25] <MaNI> instead of whinging throw support/weight behind the coins that address this so that they gain traction/popularity and outgrow the GPU coins
[14:41:34] <Raziel> I member, cause I needed more storage since even before that |L
[14:41:36] <Raziel> |: even
[14:41:42] <MaNI> Raziel, not a bundle, like physically part of the card
[14:41:47] <MaNI> if its a bundle they can just split it and resell
[14:42:04] <Raziel> MaNI, idk about having even more heat on a gpu but it's not the worst idea 
[14:42:06] <Raziel> lol
[14:42:07] <Renderwww> I'll just stick to playing games from a couple of years ago, my backlog is ready!
[14:42:14] <Carbonflux> or maybe cloud gaming is a solution, you can play games on a 3080 with a Geforce Now sub.
[14:42:27] <Raziel> or I can play them on a 3090 on my own machine
[14:42:29] * Raziel runs away
[14:42:42] <Carbonflux> heh, you don't have a 3090

[14:44:02] <Raziel> normally I wouldn't be f5-crazy on release day for these things, but it was already obvious they would all be sold out :v
[14:44:02] <Renderwww> in the beginning, maybe
[14:44:18] <Raziel> and I had a 980ti previously which was kinda showing its age
[14:44:21] <Renderwww> later on I'm sure you'll get your daily bug ration and if you don't like it you can starve
[14:46:17] <Raziel> it's really shitty how the market for these is still fucked, and one does have to wonder how much of it is crypto, since I thought the gpu minable coins were already not that hype anymore
[14:46:58] <Carbonflux> its because of Eitheriam
[14:47:02] <Carbonflux> perhaps
[14:47:22] <Carbonflux> but you might have a point, it could also be cloud computing
[14:47:43] <Carbonflux> i guess one would have to really study the market.
[14:48:04] <Raziel> the general "chip shortage" too, I suppose, although I'm not exactly sure where the bottlenecks are in that

[17:52:35] <dukwon> yes
[17:52:54] <rpav> do you live in the chernobyl vicinity?
[17:53:32] <rpav> if not, regardless of the outcome it's likely not to have much worse of an effect than the original meltdown
[17:55:02] <MaNI> not likely to have anything close to the effect of the original meltdown
[17:55:07] <dukwon> ooh, i'm almost exactly 1000 miles away
[17:55:27] <MaNI> but media has to push that nuclear panic 
[17:56:27] <rpav> i'm not sure the media is "pushing" anything; it's definitely concerning to those involved and local to the issue, which is waht is being reported
[17:56:53] <rpav> but "should i panic" comes down to "do you live by chernobyl" in which case probably panic more about the invading forces
[17:57:14] <rpav> (or don't panic; find a gun)
[17:57:45] <MaNI> medias been publishing "repeat of chernobyl imminent" stories since the moment this started, medias always pushing something :) 
[17:58:52] <MaNI> it obviously is a concern of course, just not as bad as its made out in some of the stories

[17:59:27] <Renderwww> buy mushroom futures now!
[17:59:33] <MaNI> from Ukranian side of things theres obviously incentive to over dramatise the risk to gather support for their cause, which doesn't make russia not bad and the situation not shit of course
[17:59:47] <MaNI> but important to understand the motives/incentives behind what people say
[17:59:55] <rpav> basically, yeah
[18:02:34] <dukwon> russian personnel are still allowed to perform their duties in the tunnel, for now
[18:03:22] <rpav> is that a euphemism

[18:24:28] <hinst> Onion ðŸ’­
[18:28:54] <T`aZ> not sure if sarcastic
[18:30:02] <T`aZ> 'yeah, so now you can access our content kinda from everywhere, without censorship. btw, *we* still censor tons of non mainstream content, please say thank you"
[18:31:11] <dukwon> imagine using twitter
[18:31:33] <Faux> I find the feedback on this announcement pretty hilarious. Twitter attempting to make things better for some people. Loads of outrage that it's not enough, or that twitter still exists as a closed platform.
[18:31:55] <Faux> Twitter didn't even want to do it, the enterprise onion people basically argued with them until they gave in.
[18:31:56] <rpav> as if one needs twitter to communicate
[18:32:56] <rpav> and at the same time, as if anyone is is entitled to have twitter publish their drivel
