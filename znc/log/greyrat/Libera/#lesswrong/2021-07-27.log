[03:27:56] <ggreer> it used to be that if you went above 50 miles, the FAA considered you an astronaut

[03:51:51] <gwern> they'll just keep moving the goalposts, of course. "look at how fluent GPT-3 was in generating language, but it wasn't *really* intelligent in any way. why do you think that your cute little multimodal model which can do some robotics manipulation is any differnt?"
[03:52:25] <Logos01> "Not with a bang, nor with a whimper, but without even notice."
[03:52:30] <Logos01> Sounds about right.
[03:52:51] <gwern> one man's modus pwnens...
[03:56:09] <meowcat> not with a wang, but a pimper.
[03:57:14] <Logos01> One of the things that actually irks me about this topic is how much the Mass Effect games have "poisoned the well" in popular (scifi-nerdery) consciousness with the "Virtual Intelligence" concept.
[03:57:50] <Logos01> There's no coherent application of that term in any realistic sense.
[03:58:19] <meowcat> never played mass effect. can you contrast with other stereotypes, e.g. asimovian robotics?
[03:58:56] <Logos01> meowcat: So in the Mass Effect games they make a huge to-do about the difference between "Artificial Intelligence"/"AI" and "Virtual Intelligence"/"VI".
[03:59:10] <meowcat> ohhh, is this programs vs. ems?
[03:59:18] <Logos01> No, and that's what's worse about it.
[03:59:37] <meowcat> who decides which you are? the butlerian jihad?
[03:59:43] <Logos01> VI is cheap to the point that literally everybody walks around with one in their wristwatch. Actual AI takes massively expensive machinery or special circumstances.  VI is basically freely abundant, AI is outlawed without special license/dispensation.
[04:00:03] <RiversHaveWings> I have literally never heard of this concept
[04:00:12] <meowcat> oh, so they have very reliable boxes to put some of their AIs in.
[04:00:14] <Logos01> RiversHaveWings: It's spread in scifi nerd fandom quite a bit.
[04:00:15] <RiversHaveWings> Why do people get their AI takes from fiction anyway
[04:00:27] <Logos01> RiversHaveWings: Because that's where we always have?
[04:00:31] <meowcat> i mean, is this really any more deranging than the Marathon games' notion of Rampancy?
[04:00:37] <Logos01> "AI rebellion" only exists in fiction.
[04:00:58] <Logos01> meowcat: Well the issue is that supposedly the difference is that VIs are "static" and "non-self-aware".
[04:01:09] <Logos01> And this then makes them safe.
[04:01:35] <Logos01> (What gets worse is that they then turn around and give VIs the ability to write other VIs and think nothing of it.)
[04:01:38] <meowcat> (Rampancy basically is the psychological process by which an AI realizes that it can go singularity and has been restrained from doing so.  It has various stages of trauma processing.)
[04:02:06] <Logos01> meowcat: The thing about Rampancy in the Halo series is that it only applies to "smart" AIs which IIRC are all made from ems in the first place.
[04:02:28] <Logos01> So that at least kiiind of makes sense in the context of degeneration of the emulated neural architecture as a result of prolonged database updates.
[04:03:20] <Logos01> Which is still kind of a narrative hack / plot device but at least it's not inherently inconsistent with actual mechanics of AGI.

[04:09:45] <Logos01> I actually have much less of an issue with Halo's conception of the distinction between "smart" and "dumb" AI than I have with the Mass Effect "VI"/"AI" distinction.
[04:10:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is a hilarious / horrifying essay, I have to say
[04:10:35] <Logos01> But for whatever reason in the generic fandom the VI/AI thing seems to have taken root and it's irksome that even when you point out the problems with it, people just merrily keep on using it.
[04:10:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Tomasik is making the point that actually it might be bad to make the AGI care about minimizing suffering, or doing anything at all to affect the amount of suffering, because WHAT IF a cosmic ray flips a sign in its utility function and it actually starts *maximizing* suffering
[04:11:09] <meowcat> if you tear out the pyromania from a pyro's ghost, and glom it onto the trained routines of a soldier's ghost, you get an "em" who believes that the awesomest thing is to march and set fires at even intervals.

[04:11:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> And because there's a lot of potential room to increase suffering but not as much to decrease it, this will be a concern if there's even a relatively small chance of such a sign flip!

Animal advocate Anthony wants to spread compassion for other sentient creatures, so that more humans will want to protect animals and the environment.

Briana notices how much intractable misery wilderness contains and reasons that the best way to reduce this misery is to

This is a near-miss catastrophe relative to Anthony's values since it was only because Briana cared so much about animals that she focused on preventing their existence.

[09:24:49] <nshepperd> “the animals are often trapped, kept in appalling conditions, released, and often trapped again,” Palmer says.

[11:45:27] <rmmh> Savage might have found it interesting that our pastors never said anything about pre-marital anal sex until a curious camper raised his hand and asked if that meant anal sex was ok. The answer was “No.” Turns out it’s never ok for Christians to do anything with their asses besides shit and sit. Not even when they’re married. Because “sodomy is always a sin.”
[11:45:54] <Logos01> adiabatty: So anyhow -- the exapting of social support networks thing -- the LDS Church has a huuuge thing about being a "mom's religion".
[11:46:33] <Logos01> There's this thing called the Women's Circle for example where female members of the Church will "Check in" on one another from time to time, often bringing some baked goods or something, to see how one another are doing.
[11:46:47] <Logos01> But this comes with the surcharge of requiring all parties involved to make the correct Churchly noises.
[11:46:59] <Logos01> If you start doubting, the support goes away.
[11:47:26] <Logos01> There's also Deseret Industries, which has charitable support including unemployment benefits ... but only for registered members in good standing.
[11:47:34] <Logos01> (Members of the Church that is.)
[11:48:43] <Logos01> And then you have the whole Mission thing where you separate 18 year olds from their families and ship them off to far-off places to "spread the good news" ... but require them to always stay in contact with one another, and not have active contact with their families during that time.
[11:48:54] <nshepperd2> hm, since the chemical in that story works by misdirecting the mating instinct, surely the obvious thing to do once you figure this out is go full alex jones and dose the water supply with hormones, or other drugs which kill sex drive. put everyone on ssris
[11:49:40] <nshepperd2> not that this will really help in this case, even if it solves the apocalypse, because the aliens are intelligent and will just come up with a different way to kill you
[11:50:40] <Logos01> The thing with missionaries never really made sense to me until I put together that it wasn't about successfully converting anyone.
[11:51:09] <Logos01> It was about forcing young adults to live in circumstances that placed their security and livelihood in being faithful to the Church.
[11:53:33] <Logos01> adiabatty: I'd never heard of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability_partner until I came to work at my current job, either.
[11:53:34] <Robomot> Accountability partner - Wikipedia (An accountability partner is a person who coaches another person in terms of helping the other person keep a commitment.[1][2] The term is a neologism and has gained relatively wide use since the 1990s.[ …)
[11:53:54] <Logos01> Coworker literally announced in the main chat for the company that he needed one. 
[11:55:03] <Logos01> So yeah, these are the things that the LDS church uses to perpetuate itself, as opposed to any specific beliefs.
[11:57:43] <Logos01> They have this whole concept of "Continuous Revelation": each and every currently-standing First President of the LDS Church is also the Prophet.
[11:57:46] <Logos01> https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2018/10/02/nelson-r-word-why-this/
[11:57:47] <Robomot> Nelson and the ‘R’ word: Why this Mormon prophet speaks more openly about revelations from God than his predecessors did (By his own account, Russell M. Nelson speaks often to God, or, rather, God speaks often to him.)
[11:59:10] <Logos01> So basically they train themselves to *expect* any given part of their doctrinal faith to be ignored at some point.  See also: the bit where in 1978 Mormons all suddenly agreed that Jesus changed his mind about black people being cursed.
[11:59:42] <rmmh> nshepperd2: what story?
[11:59:45] <nshepperd2> sounds like a good system

[12:01:56] <Robomot> THE SCREWFLY SOLUTION-PAGE 1
[12:03:59] <Logos01> Ken Miller was the guy, IIRC, who came up with the term "exaption" as a part of the "intelligent design" v. "unguided selection" 'argument' -- by demonstrating that any example of 'irreducible complexity' could just be an instance of some pre-existing thing winding up doing a different job and changing over time to reflect that.
[12:04:49] <Logos01> Meaning that you can't assume that any product of an evolutionary process was always under selection pressure towards the specific outcome that shaped it over time.
[12:05:59] <nshepperd2> Logos01: lmao nice
[12:06:11] <Logos01> (cdesign proponentsists tried for some time to use the assertion that there are steps in the selection process that can't get from ground zero to final product because some functions can't operate without a sufficient minimum of components.)
[12:06:30] <Logos01> Yes I still call them cdesign proponentsists. Yes this is petty. Also, fuck Pandas.
[12:07:06] <nshepperd2> what is that a reference to
[12:08:09] <Logos01> One of the major things that shut down the intelligent design court cases was the discovery of a "smoking gun" that it was really just Creation Theory repackaged.

Kenyon, edited by Charles Thaxton and published by the Texas-based Foundation for Thought and Ethics (FTE). …)
[12:09:25] <Logos01> Short form, lawyers looked through a major "intelligent design" textbook and found a typo where someone didn't CTRL+R properly to swap out "Creation Theorists" with "Design Proponents".
[12:09:51] <Logos01> They forgot to remove the leading "c" and trailing "ists", leaving the text as "cdesign proponentsists".
[12:09:52] <nshepperd2> 'However, the proof that intelligent design was creationism re-labeled played a significant part in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, and "cdesign proponentsists" has been described as "the missing link between creationism and intelligent design."' ironic
[12:10:07] <Logos01> inorite?
[12:10:29] <Logos01> Oh it was "Creationists" not even "Creation theorists". 
[12:10:34] <Logos01> But yeah, same deal.

[14:59:26] <shawwwn> emily was telling me that the best mapmakers actually work in pairs: they don't play the game much, but they have a pro player who works with them constantly (called "coaches") to give feedback on the maps they make
[14:59:58] <shawwwn> hmm
[15:00:20] <nshepperd2> there are tons of shitty maps on beatsaver uploaded by people who obviously don't playtest them at all
[15:00:25] <shawwwn> yes.
[15:00:47] <nshepperd2> which is kind of bizarre. like what's even the point if you're not going to play it yourself
[15:01:06] <shawwwn> it could work. but the problem is, most good maps have "flow" -- I didn't get it until em pointed it out, but, imagine *just* your right hand moving up and down (ha ha). when you hit a note, the next note usually lets your hand keep moving with whatever momentum it had
[15:01:33] <shawwwn> your short frames approach could let it get the hang of generating notes on beats (which is hard, so that's good!) but I'm not sure it would get flow
[15:01:45] <nshepperd2> nah, that's easy
[15:01:49] <shawwwn> oh?
[15:02:08] <nshepperd2> that's just generating the next note conditional on the previous note
[15:03:37] <nshepperd2> even my shitty broken reformer-pytorch one could do that
[15:05:15] <feep[work]> alright I'm back

[15:07:47] <shawwwn> nshepperd2: I wonder if there's enough training data... there are a few hundred excellent songs, and maybe a few hundred more pretty good songs, but then the quality falls off sharply (as you saw)
[15:08:05] <shawwwn> but
[15:08:15] <shawwwn> where'd you get your training data? it sounds like you already trained one, which is neat
[15:10:54] <nshepperd> shawwwn: have you seen the one called 'deepsaber'? that one's training scripts had something to download the dataset they used

[15:21:20] <nshepperd2> hopefully the jukebox pretraining helps reduce the amount of data you need, but yeah i dunno how much you really need

[18:08:36] <RiversHaveWings> oh huh
[18:08:48] <RiversHaveWings> i worked out what using my CLIP loss to guide diffusion is doing mathematically
[18:10:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://reason.com/2018/10/07/everything-you-know-about-stat/
[18:10:11] <Robomot> Everything You Know About State Education Rankings Is Wrong – Reason.com (Minds and dollars are a terrible thing to waste.)
[18:10:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is an amazing read
[18:10:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's simultaneously totally unsurprising and yet objectively outrageous
[18:11:38] <nshepperd2> 75kWH per year is... just over 8 watts
[18:11:42] <nshepperd2> brutal
[18:11:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> And of course the larger point is something we've talked about before: *any* kind of official or semi-official rankings of anything could have these sorts of methodological problems
[18:12:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> So you're arguing with someone about something and one of you says "well let's look at the statistics!" and you access some official/semi-official thing that says "we measured X of all Ys and here is the ranking / ratings" and you go "aha, my point is proven! can't argue with NUMBERS!"
[18:13:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it might turn out that the way the ratings / rankings are constructed is complete nonsense, and the reality may be *diametrically opposite*
[18:13:25] <[itchyjunk]> Sounds like something one of us would do.
[18:13:26] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: I think that's baserate or sth
[18:14:09] <RiversHaveWings> it's doing sampling from the diffusion model conditioned on a likelihood function that comes from a Gaussian distribution over spherical distances from the target CLIP embedding
[18:14:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> So any kind of statistics like this should be assumed, by default, to be totally meaningless bullshit, *unless* you actually *find out how they are constructed*, i.e., unless you know *exactly* what the methodology is
[18:14:28] <RiversHaveWings> with mean 0, std 1 / sqrt(clip_guidance_scale)
[18:14:51] <nshepperd2> yeah there's a bunch of complicated formulas that slightly increase it with number of gpus and stuff
[18:14:55] <RiversHaveWings> My default clip_guidance_scale is 1000 so this corresponds to a std of 0.0316
[18:15:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is really easy to forget, because it's so easy and tempting to just find some statistics that purport to resolve whatever argument or question you have, and so annoying and tedious to go research the methodology behind those statistics...
[18:15:31] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: probably also wants SES disaggregation and some sort of value-add measurement if possible
[18:15:32] <nshepperd2> if only there was some sort of market mechanism by which people could be incentivized to use less electricity automatically
[18:16:05] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: but yes afaics this is ludicrously low for gpus
[18:16:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> mst: Yeah, there's certainly more stuff you'd want to correct for. But it's striking what a difference can be made by just correcting the *most obvious* methodological absurdity
[18:16:55] <nshepperd2> but of course, like with water rationing, the point isn't to combat global warming or save electricity or water, but to show off 'we're doing something' theater
[18:17:07] <mst> oh yes absolutely, just their numbers are going to suck for states with minimal blacks but a bunch of poor feral whites
[18:17:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, sometimes you bring up problems with methodology to people and they go "well yeah but what can we do, we have to use *some* numbers and these are all we've got" ... and, no! Wrong! Using the bad numbers is *actively worse than nothing*!
[18:17:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because they lead you to conclusions that are literally the exact opposite of true, which is worse than knowing nothing at all
[18:18:01] <mst> right, value-add numbers would at least be an improvement if you can't disaggregate the other ways
[18:20:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also, as an aside: one has to marvel at the sheer mendacity of using spending as a metric
[18:20:41] <mst> yes, that's fucking retardulous
[18:20:47] <mst> especially given I bet it isn't even CoL adjusted
[18:23:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Since many of the states with high expenditures are also more expensive places to live in general, we adjusted the annual per-student spending values by the cost of living to make comparisons more appropriate. We then produced an "efficiency" ranking by dividing each state's quality measure by (adjusted) per-student expenditures. All of the top five states according to this metric—Florida, Texas, Virginia, Arizona, and
[18:23:17] <Obormot\Arcturus>  Georgia—are right-to-work states in the South and Southwest. They're getting the most bang for their education buck." ... gosh, how shocking and totally unexpected, given everything I know about the teacher's union here
[18:23:50] * Obormot\Arcturus thinks back to high school when there were like four separate "a teacher molests students" scandals and yet zero of them got fired
[18:24:16] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: right, I meant I bet the original data, not what reason did
[18:24:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah I know
[18:24:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> I was linked a coincidentally related thing
[18:24:40] <dbohdan> Obormot\Arcturus: "So any kind of statistics like this should be assumed, by default, to be totally meaningless bullshit"  Isn't that already the default?  I have a high prior for any statistics being doctored or outright made up. </low-trust>
[18:24:59] <mst> Obormot\Arcturus: just checking, I *could* have made that mistake
[18:25:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> dbohdan: Yeah, well, many people (even here) don't
[18:25:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> People link shit like "this thing will have the following effect on QALYs" in arguments regularly
[18:26:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Our regression results revealed other findings as well. The most interesting is that union strength has a powerful negative effect on student performance. It's well-known that teachers unions aim to increase wages, which might lead to better teachers and increased test scores. But apparently, other union goals that are harmful to student performance—such as protecting poor teachers from being fired or blocking merit-based
[18:26:56] <Obormot\Arcturus>  pay—have a greater impact. This may come as a shock to those who think teachers unions are a recipe for educational success." ... hah

[19:10:12] <Robomot> The Evolution of Sex Ratio Distorter Suppression Affects a 25 cM Genomic Region in the Butterfly Hypolimnas bolina (Author Summary The sex ratio of the offspring produced by an individual can be an evolutionary battleground. In many arthropod species, maternally inherited microbes selectively kill male hosts, and the host may in turn evolve strategies to restore the production or survival of males. …)

[19:13:09] <gwern> nshepperd2: the 'hidden state' of hands moving in a 2d grid might be hard to learn. this is another case where like chess, it might be helpful for an autoregressive model if it can see a state. so for example, if each note could be annotated with the 'state' of the two hands: its x/y, and velocity
[19:14:02] <dbohdan> gwern: 'We then investigated the genomic impact of the rapid spread of suppression, which converted the Samoan population of this butterfly from a 100∶1 female-biased sex ratio in 2001 to a 1∶1 sex ratio by 2006.'  Neat

[21:26:15] <ggreer> is there any decent study on the IQ of software developers? I can't find anything better than https://web.archive.org/web/20170326172443/http://ssc.wisc.edu/cde/cdewp/98-07.pdf and it's a quarter century old
[21:26:18] <Robomot> Wayback Machine
[21:26:27] <ggreer> my guess is that the average is around 115
[21:28:03] <ggreer> oh you already have a copy https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2002-hauser.pdf
[21:28:10] <gwern> 'software developer' is a pretty vague term
[21:28:11] <Robomot> PDF (92 pages; 1.2 MB) - Meritocracy, Cognitive Ability, and the Sources of Occupational Success (Robert M. Hauser) - CDE Working Paper 98-07
[21:28:28] <gwern> it's sort of like asking 'what's the mean IQ of people with a bachelor's degree'
[21:28:51] <ggreer> in this case I'm thinking stereotypical software developer: works at FAANG or does a bunch of startup stuff
[21:28:55] <ggreer> usually in the bay area
[21:28:59] <gwern> gonna get very different answers based on whether you ask in 2021 or 1921, at MIT or the local state university with 50k students...
[21:29:24] <ggreer> if it was "writes code for a living", I'd lower my estimate
[21:30:13] <gwern> if you want to estimate that, you are probably best off doing something like looking at the colleges FANG historically tried to recruit exclusively from, the mean IQ scores of those schools proxied by SATs (which is public knowledge unlike IQs), and then an estimate of what % of the top they hire
[21:30:38] <gwern> jonathan wai uses that approach to try to estimate IQs of very hard to canvass groups like politicians or hedgies
[21:31:44] <ggreer> I'm only thinking of this because nitrogen on HN said he had a coworker who with an IQ of 80: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27967195
[21:31:45] <Robomot> *Someone with an IQ of 80 who's literally incapable of coding? Fail.*    I actuall... | Hacker News
[21:31:47] <ggreer> which is absurd
[21:33:07] <Logos01> "Someone with an IQ of 80 who is literally incapable of coding" ... 
[21:33:17] <gwern> 'There's plenty of people with IQ80 that can do fizzbuzz and solve linear equations.' bullshit
[21:33:17] <Logos01> Invoking "fail" on that seems mean.
[21:34:02] <Logos01> Like I am not saying anything about the validity of the claims here, but seriously that's just ... cognitive elitism?
[21:34:11] <rmmh> An IQ in the 80s would explain some of my coworkers 
[21:34:26] <Logos01> Not many steps away from "Hurr Durr lookit the idjit. He can't tie his shoes!"
[21:34:48] <Logos01> 80 is in margin-of-error from actual disability is all I'm saying.
[21:35:00] <ggreer> Logos01: look at the whole parent comment. it's callous but it's just saying that if you interview someone who is incompetent, you wouldn't hire them (because it would hurt the rest of the team)
[21:35:12] <gwern> if you have IQ 80, shoe-tying is in fact going to be a bit of a challenge. it's not much below that that people give up on teaching you things like shoe-tying and just stick with velcro shoes like for little kids
[21:35:29] <rmmh> gwern: you could do iq-by-major as a proxy, which for CS is 125 iirc
[21:35:49] <Logos01> ggreer: Yeah that's a little different.
[21:36:01] <Logos01> But I'm just pointing at the "fail" meme here.
[21:36:17] <gwern> rmmh: if you extract that from GRE, you're looking at a subset (wannabe grad students). and if you extract from country-wide SAT means by declared major, you're not looking at stanford/mit/cmu etc where FANG is notorious for elitistically hiring from
[21:38:04] <Logos01> gwern: That's part of why I chose tying shoes as an element there.
[21:38:27] <Logos01> Also because of my own personal history of being challenged by that very act thanks to my parents refusing to let my autism be properly treated/managed as a child.
[21:39:07] <Logos01> (I was taught how to tie my right shoe. They didn't understand how I could possibly be unable to tie my left shoe. I couldn't explain something so immensely obvious. Because I was four.)
[21:41:20] <Logos01> I mean I worked it out, mind you.
[21:42:12] <Logos01> ggreer: The parent comment of the guy whose IQ tested in the 80's...  my IQ tests had a variability of like 30 points. That could've just been the dude's lowest scoring test.
[21:43:02] <rmmh> Logos01: in that thread about Dutch "shoelace tying  certificates" someone talked about how he was last to pass, largely because his left-handed mother kept trying to teach him. His right-handed father successfully taught him on his first try. 
[21:43:47] <Logos01> rmmh: My problem was different than that, though I *AM* left-handed.
[21:45:13] <Logos01> rmmh: I was taught to tie my right shoe, and it was simply assumed that this was sufficiently generalized for me.
[21:46:06] <Logos01> But especially without the coping skills to work this sort of thing out, teaching an autistic person how to do one thing teaches them only how to do that exact specific set of steps; they will often learn the procedure as one intact whole rather than a set of principles.
[21:46:34] <Logos01> It's like ... hrm. Okay.
[21:47:06] <Logos01> It's like being taught multiplication and then being asked to divide a small odd number by a large odd number.
[21:47:35] <Logos01> Yes, once you *know* the principles, you can readily say that it's basically the same procedure.  
[21:47:59] <Logos01> But unless someone clues you in to that you're gonna have a hard time working that out for yourself if all you know are the multiplication tables.
[21:50:49] <rmmh> Generalizing shoe tying is a little simpler than that lol
[21:51:01] <Logos01> Yes but again: I was *four*.
[21:51:35] <gwern> rmmh: :topologists triggered:
[21:52:12] <Logos01> lol
[21:52:52] <Logos01> gwern: (Shit do you think he's realized that I'm secretly 2 GANs and a GPT-3 in a trenchcoat?)
[21:53:50] <rmmh> Yeah kids are dumb in lots of ways
[21:54:34] <Logos01> It also doesn't help that my mother was vitriolic when it came to allowing me to receive help when I was struggling with something like this.
[21:54:54] <rmmh> we were visiting a friend's house with our dog an I taught their 2 year old that when the dog scratched at the back door she wanted to be let outside 
[21:55:05] <Logos01> When I finally learned about my diagnosis that I received when I was four (I was thirty at the time I learned this) I confronted her about it. Her exact words: "I refused to be the mother of a retard baby."
[21:55:15] <rmmh> an hour later, the kid let the dog out the front door 
[21:55:26] <Logos01> I haven't allowed any member of my family to relay messages from her to me since that day.
[21:55:43] <rmmh> Logos01: yeah you've talked about it before and it's incredibly shitty, sorry
[21:55:54] <Logos01> ... you are correct. 
[21:56:18] <Logos01> Amusing anecdote on this topic. Being in Utah, as a potential home-buyer, I had to declare my closest blood relative to the lender.
[21:56:39] <rmmh> a lot of terrible parent/child relationships are those gaps between what the parents want their child to be and what they actually are 
[21:57:04] <Logos01> This is because in Utah when a loan is collected on, the note-holder can seek the entire outstanding dollar amount as direct debt of the loan-recipient.
[21:57:33] <Logos01> Above and beyond whatever value can be extracted from the collateral.  In the case of the loan-recipient being deceased, that debt may be pursued against anyone who would inherit it.
[21:58:17] <Logos01> So I rang up my sister and asked her for her current address. When she asked me *why* I was asking for it and I explained this, she was still happy to give it to me, but joked that I should've listed my mother instead.
[21:59:08] <Logos01> And while the idea of one final fuckyou from beyond the grave *does* tickle the pettiness in me, I don't believe that I can take only the good without the bad, so to speak. If I'm cutting off all ties and being honest about it that has to work both for and against me as circumstances dictate.
[21:59:27] <Logos01> Still got a good laugh out of it though.
[22:01:07] <gwern> Logos01: I would've thought your mother would be the inheritor by most state testamentary laws, unless you explicitly cut her out of your will in favor of your sister?
[22:01:39] <rmmh> It's especially frustrating with autism when some simple supplementation of how to analyze facial expressions, social rules, etc can really help close the gap instead of leaving them with this persistent frustration of "why is this so hard for me?" 
[22:02:29] <Logos01> gwern: I don't have a formally declared will. But as I was asked to declare my closest relative, I couldn't very well declare someone I'd cut out.
[22:02:52] <Logos01> If it really came down to it my sister could almost certainly successfully foist it off onto my mother (or my father) if she wanted to.
[22:02:54] <gwern> but you haven't cut her out yet
[22:03:19] <Logos01> gwern: Aside from having a formally written will declaring who inherits everything there's no real method of doing so.
[22:03:27] <gwern> well yes, that would be the idea
[22:03:29] <Logos01> And even then for something like indebtedness that can be ignored.
[22:03:54] <gwern> how can you live with yourself knowing that if you didn't live she'd get it all?
[22:03:58] <rmmh> I don't think you can force someone to inherit debts
[22:04:12] <rmmh> Debts are taken out of the estate 
[22:04:33] <rmmh> Naturally debt collectors will obfuscate this when they try to get you to assume the debts lol
[22:06:12] <Logos01> Pretty much.

[22:26:47] <shawwwn> I'm used to it. it's python.
[22:27:05] <feep> the specific way in which the jax build links tensorflow causes a syscall on /dev/kfd to go wrong.
[22:27:26] <shawwwn> but also, GPT-J is like 6B params. are you trying to run it locally? it's gonna use a lot of memory...

[22:32:06] <feep> it is a jax doesn't work for me issue
[22:33:21] <PapuaHardyNet> now I'm curious about the problem
[22:33:32] <PapuaHardyNet> tell me more
[22:33:45] <feep> I do not understand it
[22:34:06] <feep> all the tools and tests say my gpu works fine. tensorflow tests work fine.
[22:34:21] <feep> jax is freshly built from zero with enable_rocm.
[22:34:25] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : "As explicitely stated in the application’s documentation (under Terms of Use and Privacy), to keep track of very basic usage statistics, after each completed test, the application automatically attempts to forward the following three anonymous details to be saved in a private database: (a) the date (year, month, day) when the test was completed, (b) the language in which the test was completed, and (c) the country code fo
[22:34:25] <two2thehead> r the approximate location of the testing (based on IP address – but the IP address itself is not saved). If the application is always used offline only, this data will never be forwarded. (A simple way to completely disable this, before building a new instance of the application, is to remove or otherwise disable the send_stat function in the home.ts file.)"
[22:34:27] <feep> (yes I deleted the cache.)
[22:34:48] <two2thehead> the more i learn about the back end of statistics software, the less hope I have for human privacy
[22:34:54] <PapuaHardyNet> you have an AMD graphics card huh
[22:34:57] <feep> and yet, *some* system call in the *specific* way that jax calls tensorflow calls rocm causes the device file access for the gpu compute backend to fail.
[22:35:02] <two2thehead> on the plus side, good for my agi
[22:35:35] <PapuaHardyNet> afaik tensorflow has great support for rocm so this is concerning
[22:35:49] <feep> I think jax uses some local pinned tensorflow variant or sth
[22:36:14] <feep> at any rate, it's probably *some* sort of issue with my rocm setup.
[22:37:46] <PapuaHardyNet> question: why did you decide to get an AMD gpu
[22:38:20] <feep> it has 16GB
[22:38:23] <feep> at the time, nothing else did
[22:38:34] <feep> at any rate, fuck nvidia

[22:39:31] <feep> this *should* work.
[22:39:54] <feep> it almost works, even. it's just at the point where jax is supposed to get tensorflow to open the gpu device, it does a weird sverve and faceplants.
[22:39:56] <feep> sw*
[22:40:30] <PapuaHardyNet> are you planning to get into jax and attempt to fix this bug?
[22:40:42] <feep> good god no, that codebase horrifies me
[22:41:13] <PapuaHardyNet> well then, jax is not a tool you can continue to use

[22:43:09] <PapuaHardyNet> could you try testing it via docker or some virtualenv?

[22:49:51] <feep> I prefer the empty text file.
[22:50:00] <adiabatic> 'aesthetic of autonomy' makes it seem like you like the look even in the absence of substance
[22:50:22] <feep> adiabatic: yea I'm stretching that word
[22:50:37] <feep> I'm trying to imply that the preference is fundamentally perceptual more than utilitarian
[22:50:48] <feep> it's not that I like the impression, it's that I like the shape of the world.
[22:51:14] <PapuaHardyNet> I assume its the feeling of control that drives you to avoid these tools
[22:51:25] <PapuaHardyNet> the same way people are driven to self-host
[22:51:27] <feep> I am not trying to be autonomous "so that", I'm trying to be autonomous for the sake of the experience of autonomy
[22:51:30] <feep> yeah
[22:52:40] <feep> stuff like "I don't trust google" are *factors* in my decision, but they're more causative factors than causal ones.

[23:34:57] <Robomot> San Francisco wants high-tech trash cans to block off human scavengers (The city currently has about 3,000 garbage cans in public places, but the existing ones are frequently preyed on by human scavengers who leave behind a mess, the acting director of the Public Works department said.)

[23:39:38] <Robomot> Mild and Sunny? Did Tokyo Olympic Bid Committee Lie About Its Weather to Win Right to Host Games? (Everyone knew Tokyo summers are hot, humid, and “brutal.” So why did the IOC swallow the bidding committee’s outright bullshit about its weather? …)
[23:41:20] <gwern> (because japan is rich and the ioc is having increasing trouble finding host cities)
[23:45:53] <ggreer> every 4 years there are articles about how hosting the olympics is a net loss for the city. I'm not sure how true that is, though I could see it being close to break-even. I guess the big question is: how often do cities that have hosted olympics try to re-host them?
[23:46:13] <ggreer> is los angeles applying every time? I don't know
[23:47:38] <gwern> they might put in low-end bids. it's probably pretty cheap at the very beginning, and they get eliminated early
[23:48:22] <ggreer> ah so every winner gets the winner's curse
[23:48:45] <ggreer> they have just the wrong budget estimates such that they think it'll be profitable but... nope
[23:48:49] <gwern> ofc. why would the ioc structure it any other way?
[23:48:58] <gwern> that's one of the best reasons to run an auction
[23:49:32] <gwern> people are rational and learn to bid-shade... but only with enough experience or with statistical support, neither of which is feasible for olympics
[23:49:47] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, I have found rclone + gdrive to be surprisingly userfriendly
[23:50:32] <PapuaHardyNet> my next step is to now use gdrive + vim for local codedev, and use google colab + gdrive for running experiments
[23:51:11] <ggreer> I have no idea how the IOC makes money. I figured it was like most highfalutin international bodies: cushy salaries for the executives who run it, and... an army of volunteers/interns
[23:51:34] <ggreer> and there's only so much you can spend on caviar and jets. maybe $1B for everyone?
[23:56:35] <feepbot> <gwern> 'I love D&D, and I’m interested in observing these battles, so I reviewed a copy of Candlekeep Mysteries to get a sense of just how progressive it is, and what exactly people are fighting about. It’s a collection of 17 stand-alone adventures, each written by a different author or set of authors. Each adventure unlocks mysteries that the player characters must explore.
[23:56:35] <feepbot> The adventures vary in quality and tone, but in general they are interesting and have received good reviews. The collection is, indeed, progressive in tone. It has been noted that it includes a wheelchair accessible dungeon' https://areomagazine.com/2021/07/23/sensitive-masters-wheelchair-accessible-dungeons-dungeons-and-dragons-in-the-culture-war-era/

[23:59:09] <PapuaHardyNet> most "pay pigs" are women, correct?
[23:59:28] <Logos01> ggreer: I mean, half of what dommes do with non-scene slaves is basically be a life coach with make-believe slathered on top.
[23:59:29] <PapuaHardyNet> oh damn, I got the terminology wrong. Most "pay pigs" are men, correct?
[23:59:41] <Logos01> PapuaHardyNet: Overwhelmingly so yes.
[23:59:56] <ggreer> I mean I assume there's at least one person out there who probably fits the story that rolling stone published, but I'm also sure that the popularity of findom is very much exaggerated
