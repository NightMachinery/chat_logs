[00:55:17] <Gaboradon> Are you serious tho that it is a good example? I mean I'm just kinda speculating, but I would be surprised descriptions/labels would be something other utilities would rely on instead of .id and internal names 0x0... etc

[01:03:10] <Gaboradon> That's what one of the guys on #alsa thought, but KDE or the apps KDE uses don't talk about CODEC, they just reference the controller's description everwhere so you get this long string of gibberish Family 17 nonsense everwhere in volume controls and Audio Outputs.

[01:06:18] <Gaboradon> Because if the HD Audio controlled on AMD chipset doesn't really do anything significant in terms of audio features and audio quality, what's the point of showing the controller's information to the user and audio devices in genral, the CODEC is the main chip and the OP-AMPs and the hardware around it that processes and generates actual audio.

[06:07:41] <Sauvin> Yup. OK, get out of incrontab -e without saving changes. Write a script that moves source_dir/* to targ_dir (those are generic names, supply your own). Verify the script works by copying some files into source_dir/ and running the script (from some other directory) and checking that they moved to targ_dir.
[06:08:22] <MrCollinsGA> Sauvin, I 100% have already verified that. It works 100%.

[09:13:18] <jkhuu> so I decided to rebuild problem packages w/o unnedded crap
[09:13:24] <alMalsamo> Old Linux versions authenticate to WPA2 network, but I cannot ping any host including the AP

[11:23:53] <Sauvin> There've been a few actors over the years who'd had recognisable parts in TV shows as medical doctors who'b subsequently been hired to endorse some product or other. They'd say "I'm not a doctor, although I've played a doctor on TV".

[11:31:49] <earendel> well if you keep your library downwards compatible to some extent.. like between major versions... people may use an updated version without breaking their code.. or is that what you put little trust at?

[13:46:08] <tirnanog> a stub .bash_profile that sources .profile might be simpler, with the latter running `if [ "$BASH" ] && [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi`  it is a bit of a nuisance that bash doesn't favour .profile over .bash_profile.
[13:46:56] <geirha> there's no point in .bash_profile at that point. Just put the bash specific stuff, if any, inside an if [ "$BASH" ] in .profile
[13:47:14] <tirnanog> I'm aware of that, but it's an obvious pitfall in so far as recommending the approach to others is concerned.

[14:09:12] <geirha> obvs: in all three cases /etc/profile is right there
[14:09:19] <tirnanog> well, /etc/profile is always sourced by bash in its capacity as login shell, if it exists (no matter the platform). /etc/bashrc would be subject to a bash compile-time option but, still, it would only be sourced by an interactive bash. therefore, it's not an "alternative" location for /etc/profile, as it were.

[14:16:03] <H4ndy> fakuve: that's very... generic. Usually temlates can be found for specific CMS or templating systems and not just generic HTML
[14:16:20] <H4ndy> for example, you will find many free templates for bootstrap
[14:16:26] <obvs> then there is zsh, csh, dash etc. etc. - which is why I say, bash specific code should not go in /etc/profile
[14:16:44] <obvs> and that the location of the rc scripts vary on varying flavours of unix
[14:16:48] <tirnanog> nobody contended that it would be sensible to put bash-specific code in /etc/profile, though. though it is possible.
[14:17:03] <geirha> agreed, but you don't need bash specific code to assign environment variables
[14:17:15] <phogg> obvs: it generally should not, but usually does (although typically via /etc/profile.d/* scripts sourced from /etc/profile)
[14:17:43] <fakuve> H4ndy: ok I'm gonna try finding a directory of templates for bootstrap thanks
[14:17:57] <geirha> and csh doesn't factor in; it's not a bourne style shell, and won't try to read /etc/profile
[14:18:54] <obvs> Funny, my bash shell on a FreeBSD jail hosted on a TrueNAS host - does not have /etc/profile.d/
[14:19:03] <obvs> I guess the location varies on varying flavours of unix right
[14:19:31] <geirha> bash only sources /etc/profile.  /etc/profile.d   is something some OSes does by adding a loop in /etc/profile

[14:21:38] <obvs> I still strongly standby the statement that the location of where you put your global shell profile code, varies across the various flavours of unix :)
[14:21:45] <tirnanog> that makes sense, actually.
[14:21:53] <phogg> obvs: they then communicate their intended flow to the admins/users of their distro. This advice is just to inform us of how they put it together, but it's descriptive not prescriptive.

[14:22:37] <geirha> but bashrc is for setting up your interactive bash session, while profile is for setting up your environment. Different purposes used at different times
[14:22:51] <obvs> except like, maybe a box has a shell other than bash, and maybe your /etc/profile won't execute in those shells, and maybe its better you go for a location specific to bash which is not /etc/profile

[20:48:33] <mrfb> in my opinion, both python and ruby (Im biased towards ruby) have excellent html parsing libraries, nokogiri being the most powerful. In fact removing duplicates from a file is not more than 3 lines of code

[21:35:53] <lacroix> labrador, certs are a signature, you can't have a cert without one.  so a keypair signing itself is called a self-signed cert (rather than having a different keypair - one belonging to the CA - do the signing)
[21:36:10] <lacroix> labrador, to check trustworthiness, you start with the cert and check signatures working your way up the chain till you hit a keypair that you already know about and trust.

[23:26:04] <danisanti> tirnanog: so routes decide the network interfaces to where a packet may go?
[23:26:30] <tirnanog> you might as well answer the question for yourself. try "ip route get 8.8.8.8".

[23:27:44] <danisanti> tirnanog: I tried. it says it goes to 192.168.1.254 on device wlan0 with my source ip address
[23:27:58] <tirnanog> the routing table is consulted, a decision made, and the results shown, which include the interface through which the packet would be physically transmitted and, in this case, the address of the next hop (192.168.1.254).
[23:28:27] <tirnanog> none of that information could be inferred without the existence of a route.
[23:28:55] <danisanti> tirnanog: ok

[23:29:58] <danisanti> tirnanog: besides the normal internet set up, may I say that routes have a special place when I have various network devices connected to my machine?
[23:30:01] <tirnanog> in this case, punt it to 192.168.1.254 - your router - upon which it repeats that very same process.

[23:31:30] <tirnanog> yes. look at the "link" scoped routes in your table, for example.
[23:31:40] <uwharrie> danisanti: yes. you typically have at least 2, one for loopback/localhost, and one for the default/egress router

[23:35:21] *** Quits: LuksNuke (~LuksNuke@gateway/tor-sasl/luksnuke) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[23:35:37] <tirnanog> that your link has obviously been provisioned with an address within the 192.168.1.0/24 network and that any packet destined to that network should be transmitted through wlan0.
[23:35:44] <tirnanog> oh, and it was provisioned with dhcp.

[23:38:35] <tirnanog> to put it in layman's terms, it has link scope because the route concerns a local network and not a destination that is more than one hop away.

[23:39:16] <tirnanog> n.b. you don't have to go through a router to reach the 192.168.1.0/24 network. you're already part of it.
