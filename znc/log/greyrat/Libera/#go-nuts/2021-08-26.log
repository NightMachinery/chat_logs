[00:32:30] <fub> I'm fighting with some code here which makes use of gorilla/websocket. The lib I want to use reads continuously from a websocket and tries to send a ping in periodic intervals. Sometimes the reading fails and the connection is broken (websocket: close 1006 (abnormal closure): unexpected EOF)
[00:33:02] <fub> By running the code with the race detector, it shows thats there is a "data race"
[00:33:47] *** Quits: jpw_ (~jpw@user/jpw) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[00:34:08] *** Joins: jpw (~jpw@user/jpw)
[00:34:24] <fub> The code is here: https://github.com/CaliDog/certstream-go/blob/master/certstream.go and the race occurs because of L41 and L51
[00:34:51] <fub> while data is read from the websocket, a ping is sent, which breaks it
[00:35:21] <fub> so how could this be fixed, with a lock? I looked at the gorilla chat example to see how they are doing it here: https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/gorilla/websocket/+/v1.2.0/examples/chat/client.go
[00:35:48] <fub> but they do not use a lock
[00:35:59] <fub> what do I miss here?

[07:10:02] <iskarian> On Go 1.16, when building a module from its own directory with a package path (`go build example.com/module`) the build cache hash key seems to be different than building the exact same module at the exact same version using a version suffix (`go build example.com/module@0.3`). Is there a way around this? (Or: is this fixed in 1.17?)

[11:35:07] <toretto> Can a "go module", like the one with go.mod and go.sum files, have a `main()` function? (I think a "module" doesn't have a main function, but rather only helper functions since it's like "libraries" right?)

[11:35:44] <ikke> It sure can

[11:36:55] <toretto> I see. I always thought a "package" (other than main) and a go "module" doens't have a main() function since those are libraries, like in C land.
[11:37:00] <toretto> But yeah, makes sense.

[11:41:35] <IceMichael> b0nn, we are mostly purely remote, we are just limited to some countries because our administration not sitting/having contracts everywhere
[11:42:01] <toretto> It's always weired when I see people saying it's hard to get Python devs, being one of the simplest languages *smh*
[11:42:30] <A_Dragon> python is really all that simple

[11:42:56] <A_Dragon> python is very complex as soon as you do something big in it
[11:43:00] <toretto> I'd agree if it's C or C++ devs, since the tech is pretty hard and needed for specific high performance applications.
[11:43:04] <toretto> But py? nah
[11:43:05] <sztanpet> python simple? i guess its all relative
[11:43:17] <A_Dragon> python is more complex than C too
[11:43:21] <A_Dragon> C++? debatable
[11:43:26] <IceMichael> we are looking for Python Django devs and Django has some complexity to it
[11:43:33] <A_Dragon> C++ has a whole heck of a lot of magic to it, as does python
[11:43:36] <IceMichael> also, it's always a question about "python dev" and "good python dev"
[11:43:42] <A_Dragon> ^
[11:43:53] <A_Dragon> being good at python is also nontrivial
[11:43:53] <toretto> ^ i agree
[11:44:05] <A_Dragon> it requires deep knowledge of the runtime and backend behaviour
[11:44:18] <A_Dragon> half of the python devs around wont know what a metaclass is, for example
[11:44:24] <A_Dragon> nor should they, to be fair
[11:44:37] <A_Dragon> like all things there are abstractions and levels of complexity
[11:44:49] <A_Dragon> knowing whats behind the abstractions can be maddening, but also very helpful
[11:44:55] <toretto> I'd guess the easiest one being Java
[11:45:06] <toretto> there are ton of Java devs.

[22:57:03] <Seirdy> noob question: over time, some of the errors in my little codebase have become unreachable; however, bugs may cause them to become reachable again. i've since converted them to panics since if they are reached, something is very wrong and bugs are likely afoot. examples include crypto/rand's int() returned an error, or division of two floats creating a nan when they should be initialized to good
[22:57:05] <Seirdy> values (or i have a bug).
[22:57:07] <Seirdy> i'm aiming for good test coverage, but am not covering these panics since they shouldn't even be reachable in the first place. is that a good strategy? if so, is there a way to get test coverage reports that exclude lines that i'm okay with being unreachable?
[22:57:09] <Seirdy> relevant gh issue tells me that this isn't possible with vanilla "go test" and explains the rationale a bit: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/31280
