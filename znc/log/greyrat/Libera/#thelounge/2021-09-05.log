[16:35:48] <luva> bookworm, It plays for me
[16:36:12] <luva> Im not talking about posting links to memes, but thelounge has the function to add pictures itself right, it automatically creates a link then
[16:36:20] <luva> with the domain of thelounge 
[16:36:32] <luva> When doing it with a gif, it turns into a still picture
[16:37:22] <bookworm> yes, that's the bug I mentioned
[16:37:41] <bookworm> upgrade to the pre-relase or wait until the proper release happens and this should go away
[16:37:49] <luva> ah okay, sorry I didnt get that part
[16:37:52] <luva> alright
[16:38:10] <luva> thanks for answering
[16:38:24] <bookworm> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/4109 if you are interested in the bug
[16:41:26] <luva> November 2020?
[16:41:34] <bookworm> yes?
[16:41:35] <luva> Why is this not already long patched in the stable version? :D
[16:42:10] <bookworm> because releases take time, other things are on the corresponding branches too, TL doesn't do backports to stable branches, we tend to update forward
[16:42:55] <bookworm> you are free to install TL from source and run the bleeding edge if you so choose
[16:43:05] <luva> okay, well you're all doinga pretty good job with thelounge, its awesome, so thanks for all
[16:46:02] <lazyreader> "how dare this free software I use not be bug-free!"
[16:46:30] <bookworm> take it easy, I think they got the point
[16:46:39] <luva> I wasnt complaining
[16:46:46] <luva> I was just curious
[16:47:13] <luva> Its something different of being a karen and complaining, or just curious 
[16:47:48] <bookworm> (it did come across as a complaint for me too, just fyi)

[18:28:02] <liquidity> activ8 - yes, I got it working. I had to turn off the other thing that was running on port 9000 and it worked right away. i sort of need that other thing (portainer) so today i get to learn about docker ports and how to set them :)
[18:35:46] <bookworm> there's also ##docker iirc, in case you run into problems with the docs
[18:36:18] <bookworm> meh, one #, so #docker

[19:53:33] <luva> liquidity I also have portainer, I dont know how you did it, but you can also just within portainer make the line for thelounge container changed
[19:53:39] <luva> ports: 
[19:53:49] <luva>     - 9001:9000
[19:54:45] <liquidity> i thought i tried that, but i will try again, thanks luva
[19:55:31] <liquidity> i did have a lot of moving parts all new at once, but i didn't have many other options. i'm running all this on my QNAP NAS. no worries, i like learning new things and have been planning to learn docker better anyway
[19:55:35] <luva> liquidity
[19:55:38] <luva> https://dpaste.com/CA5J3C2KF
[19:55:51] <luva> you can use this for example and create a stack with this in portainer
[19:56:17] <liquidity> cool, thank you!
[19:56:42] <knolle> shouldn't that be 9001:9000?
[19:56:58] <luva> you ahve to change line to 9001:9000 and also the volume you want to use on your host
[19:57:25] <luva> yes knolle, I changed my thelounge port also in config.js thats why it was  9001:9001
[19:59:08] <luva> https://dpaste.com/FWCFSUA4J here its maybe better to understand liquidity
[19:59:36] <liquidity> i got it, thanks much
[20:04:04] <Activ8> docker is easy to understand there's an outsidePORT>insidePORT>application:PORT  (for example 9001:9000:9000 - 9001 is the access port http://127.0.0.1:9001
[20:04:10] <Activ8> but yeh #docker

[20:37:49] <Activ8> Awesome you mean pwa mode (progressive web app)?
[20:40:44] <liquidity> hmm i don't think so - it's this command (on mac): Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome --app=<url> - all it does is open a web browser with no tabs and no address bar so TL works like an app
[20:42:40] <liquidity> when i open TL in a regular chrome browser it doesn't give me the option to install it as a PWA
