[00:08:42] <tjcarter> blackop: do you need a separate partition at all then?
[00:08:56] <tjcarter> if you make /boot a partition, you will get kernels too on Debian
[00:09:05] <blackop> i heard separate /boot is secure
[00:09:29] <tjcarter> It can be if you use LUKS to encrypt your system
[00:09:53] <blackop> someone mentioned there is signed kernels
[00:09:59] <blackop> what is it?
[00:10:16] <tjcarter> One question at a time, I'll come back to signed kernels
[00:10:35] <blackop> ok
[00:12:28] <tjcarter> LUKS is "whole disk encryption" for Linux. You can either encrypt everything except GRUB and its config which is pretty secure, but a little harder to recover from anything going wrong or you can encrypt everything but your /boot partition. It allows GRUB's setup to be ignorant of encryption and lets you boot into at least a rescue initramfs to fix something that breaks. But … what's in your
[00:12:30] <tjcarter> kernels and initramfs can be viewed by the outside world.
[00:12:35] <greycat> There is nothing inherently "more secure" about a different partition layout.  You'd use a separate /boot only if there's a reason for doing so, such as "the type of disk encryption that I want to do requires it".
[00:13:20] <tjcarter> grub and your kernels can be signed, which is about EFI + Microsoft's SecureBoot. It's necessary because some systems can't turn the latter off and theoretically it's "more secure" to leave it on anyway.
[00:13:54] <tjcarter> Not in reality though because Microsoft had a f**king back door in Secure Boot so they could help corporate customers who lost their passwords bypass them.
[00:14:33] <tjcarter> The whole world knows it exists and how to use it. Sooo secure. And Microsoft CANNOT patch it out.
[00:14:58] <pasiz> boot partition existed mainly of the 1024 sector limit

[00:15:37] <tjcarter> pasiz is correct, until LUKS became a thing, boot partitions were mostly about getting Linux loaded so Linux could bypass BIOS limitations, whatever they were.
[00:15:42] <pasiz> yes
[00:16:06] *** Joins: GenTooMan (~cyberman@2601:547:437f:e5c6:21f:5bff:fefe:a883)
[00:16:21] <tjcarter> Technically as I said you no longer need one even for LUKS, but I still keep one so that my kernels and initramfses are bootable without one.
[00:16:31] <pasiz> cannot understand what is purpose to encrypt disk. if i ever need some encrypted, it would be my home partition
[00:16:42] <pasiz> and there is reason why it is separate on all machines
[00:17:01] <tjcarter> By default, on Debian, /home is not separate.
[00:17:11] <tjcarter> Not in many years
[00:17:35] <pasiz> tjcarter: on most systems it isn't, but i have reason to not overwrite my /home if i decide to change distribution on install
[00:17:43] <greycat> /home is the first partition I'd want to split out, personally
[00:17:45] <blackop> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEl2S5MI-WU
[00:17:51] <tjcarter> However, this machine, aki… Its /home used to live on a Debian sid machine named chiyo.
[00:18:29] <pasiz> nice name
[00:18:30] <blackop> what is the difference installing everything in / or having separated partitions for all directories?
[00:18:56] <pasiz> blackop: separate home is good if you don't want to lose your home directory on distro change / reinstall
[00:19:11] <greycat> One of the many potential reasons to have a separate /home: you can share it among multiple Unix OSes on the same disk.
[00:19:28] <pasiz> greycat: that too
[00:19:31] *** Joins: spare (~v3epgr4gd@user/spareproject)
[00:19:45] <tjcarter> That machine had LUKS encrypted partitions with LVM (logical volume manager) on top, and /home was separate. At some point chiyo became a Mint 19.3 system for work, then Mint 20, then the /home got moved to aki when I built the new system and used chiyo's parts to fix two other machines. And now aki is once again Debian sid.
[00:19:47] <pasiz> on vm:s it's quite hard ;)

[00:20:15] <jessicara> i'm not far away from /home being on the network
[00:20:18] * greycat is not gonna watch some damned random youtube video and answer questions about it
[00:20:19] <tjcarter> I would never put /home on the same filesystem as / and you can kinda see why

[00:21:28] <tjcarter> ext4 is typical nowadays for both

[03:51:48] <tomreyn> there are physical disks, there are partitions, there are file systems, and there are directories. i think you're mixing those terms up a bit.

[04:01:57] <tjcarter> dob1: A trick I learned from the Linux Mint crowd. I am _very_ fond of it now.

[04:23:27] <dpkg> When you get random packages from random repositories, mix multiple releases of Debian, or mix Debian and derived distributions, you have a mess.

[13:51:05] <Haohmaru> right
[13:51:24] <Haohmaru> so then you shouldn't have been looking for binaries, i'd think
[13:51:44] <vipulogmx_> Library it is
[13:52:10] <Haohmaru> ,v freecad
[13:52:11] <judd> Package: freecad on amd64 -- stretch: 0.16+dfsg2-3; buster: 0.18~pre1+dfsg1-5; bullseye: 0.19.1+dfsg1-2; bookworm: 0.19.2+dfsg1-1; sid: 0.19.2+dfsg1-1; sid: 0.19.2+dfsg1-2
[13:53:43] <vipulogmx_> Yeah the thing is. I was searching for opencascade because while compiling freecad it looks for opencascade as a dependency and I can't find anything that's called exactly that. The dependencies have it in full caps as description so I couldn't find the libraries as well

[13:54:50] <vipulogmx_> Need the development version
[13:55:05] <jelly> in that case, enable deb-src
[13:55:09] <jelly> !deb-src
[13:55:09] <dpkg> You can have apt download the <source package> from which a <binary package> was compiled using a "deb-src" line in your <sources.list>. A line like "deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian sid main" does NOT make any binary packages available. Ask me about <source> <package recompile> <ssb>; make sure the "build-essential" package is installed.  You might need linux-headers-$(uname -r) package installed.
[13:55:46] <jelly> and then "apt-get build-dep freecad" will pull in ALL the headers and libraries than debian uses when building freecad
[13:55:50] <jelly> !build-dep
[13:55:51] <dpkg> build-deps are the packages you need to compile a package.  "aptitude build-dep package-you-want-to-build" will install them, or use mk-build-deps (equivs package) to have undo-able build-dep installation.  If using <uupdate> or <ssb> to update a package, you will likely need additional -dev packages.  You can «/msg judd builddeps package».

[14:08:23] <TheAvatar> Hey. Say you have 150 servers (not all Debian), and you want to manage users on all of them. How would you do that? Say you have a new sysadmin employee, who needs a personal user with sudo access. Logging in to every single one of them is quite tedious :)

[14:11:45] <TheAvatar> shtrb, and that's fairly easy to configure (I know it is a quite generic question)? So the first time on each server we will have some work to do, but afterwards it will be easier.
[14:12:11] <TheAvatar> But you can manage the user, and you make a sudo group, that you add the user to in radius/ldap, and you wont have to manually do something with sudo on each of the servers?
[14:12:24] <shtrb> TheAvatar, assuming you ok with a centrlized solution like ldap or radius. both radius and ldap are not trivial subjects and are not something you should just switch but only after very carefull considuration
[14:12:58] <TheAvatar> that's the answer I was expecting, but hoping for something different :p
[14:12:58] <PerfDave> TheAvatar: I'd look at something like Ansible to consistently manage the fleet of servers in as standardised a way as possible.
[14:13:27] <PerfDave> TheAvatar: I'd also not look at LDAP or similar for a sysadmin user. Because the sysadmin user will need to be able to log in to investigate when LDAP isn't working :)
[14:14:35] <TheAvatar> I see. Depending on what the system allows, having an emergency access local user for such tasks would do

[19:59:15] <LiENUS> my goal is to work on debian, just not be tied to  a specific arch
[19:59:28] <PerfDave> tjcarter: Debian was a bit late to the multiarch party because it wanted to make a generic solution rather than the bodges for i386/amd64, ppc/ppc64 and arm32/arm64 that other distros came up with. Others have followed Debian's approach since then.

[19:59:55] <jelly> seems to work
[20:00:12] <LiENUS> i feel like at one point there was a webpage that told how to get the suffix on the debian documentation

[20:00:45] <PMT> https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/Tuples was what I had open
[20:00:51] <joyce72> so I believe my gf CrazyNeko was talking about a P4 system earlier? I am going to try to re-enable nouveau if that's what I understood about driver support?
[20:01:04] <tjcarter> PerfDave: lib32/lib64? I have some dim memories of that
[20:01:54] <tjcarter> joyce72: I don't think any current nv driver is likely to support the hardware more/better than nouveau is at this point.
[20:01:54] <joyce72> so the actual issue at hand is that right after boot, just at the time when gdm3 or lightdm is supposed to load, there's only a black screen
[20:02:15] <joyce72> the machine effectively hangs, it responds to nothing
[20:02:20] <PerfDave> joyce72: The consensus seemed to be that a GeForce2 MX400 isn't supported by modern versions of the nVidia proprietary drivers and nouveau might be a better option
[20:02:26] <PerfDave> joyce72: Can you SSH into it while it's like that?
[20:02:31] <joyce72> I don't know
[20:02:42] <tjcarter> If you cannot, it's likely AGP locked
[20:02:51] <alkisg> joyce72: the last time I used nvidia drivers with mx400 was more than 10 years ago, and I had to use the older (not current) nvidia drivers even then
[20:02:57] <alkisg> joyce72: use nouveau...
[20:03:09] <joyce72> I am SSHed into it at the moment, and it seems like she hasn't unblacklisted nouveau yet
[20:03:17] <joyce72> which is what I am going to try and do
[20:03:22] <tjcarter> alkisg: attempts have already been made to install nv. removing that might leave the system in an inconsistent state
[20:03:51] <joyce72> although I configured the system to not start the GUI at boot
[20:04:05] <joyce72> CrazyNeko: I'll do a reboot now

[20:07:06] <tjcarter> The ultimate solutions were to use a PCI card with an AGP slot like a Voodoo 3, get an external drive controller and not use the IDE bus, or wait a few years for kernel devs to find the bugs in the chip and work around them as driver quirks
