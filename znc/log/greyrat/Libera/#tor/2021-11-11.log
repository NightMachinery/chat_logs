[03:01:59] <tar_xvf> i'm late to this conversation but if you have people who know what they're doing on irc, you can tell them to enable tls and disable listening to the plaintext port.
[03:08:58] <xx> tar_xvf: sadly it's a bit late once that has happened - their password is leaked, or a trivial link between username and IP address was observed
[03:09:15] <xx> that's why secure-by-default should be... default
[03:10:01] <xx> if you wish for libera to improve, send them an email (mentioning it in #libera will not lead to anything)
[04:53:33] <Atque> xx: I don't think it would be unreasonable for libera to not support cleartext connections (except over the .onion I guess).
[04:54:46] <xx> Atque: they had a choice to not support them a few months ago when the network started, and they obviously chose to support them
[04:55:31] <Atque> xx: Yea, for compatibility I imagine.

[07:02:19] <tar_xvf> i can think of a few specific examples where someone else logging on with plaintext would be a security concern for you but on the libera network most text channels can be accessed by anyone who logs in anway so it doesn't add any security. Now if you have a server where all channels can only be viewed by people who have a registered account which is handed out by ops to trusted people, for example, then you could have
[07:02:19] <tar_xvf>  more security concerns about plaintext
[07:04:06] <xx> tar_xvf: it's more about somebody else being able to impersonate you and thus get others to hand over server access if they already know you
[07:04:35] <xx> server admins can already do that, but likely are not doing that right now
[07:04:54] <xx> but plaintext connections allow "anyone" to do that

[22:14:34] <Guest39> hello
[22:14:41] <Guest39> tor browser is 100% anon?
[22:15:02] <Guest39> i hate cookies Xd
[22:15:10] <Guest39> they steal all data
[22:19:25] <xx> Guest39: only anonymous if you know how to use it properly
[22:19:34] *** Joins: TheHermann (~TheHerman@gateway/tor-sasl/thehermann)
[22:20:27] <Guest39> xx and how to use it properly? JS will prevent most fingerprinting - what's left
[22:20:36] <Guest39> how can sites fingerpring without js
[22:21:42] <xx> you'll still be uniquely identified if you use a website that few other tor users use, even if you disable JS, and especially if you login to some account where you already logged into without tor before
[22:22:01] <xx> and even worse, if you included some data in that account that can be used to identify you, such as email/phone number
[22:23:24] <Guest39> even if under 10 people use that site - what does it mean anyways?
[22:23:49] <Guest39> each tor browser session looks exactly as another tor browser session - only exit ip may differ
[22:24:10] <xx> the time of day you access it can reveal what part of the world you likely are from for example
[22:24:19] <Guest39> how?
[22:24:26] <xx> most people sleep at night
[22:24:59] <Guest39> how will site know local time with js off
[22:25:04] <xx> then there's your behavior on that site that can uniquely identify you, such as the language style you use, or how long you spend reading something before clicking another link, etc.
[22:25:39] <xx> Guest39: if you access something when it's 3am in europe, you're most likely not in europe right now
[22:25:44] <xx> because you should be sleeping
[22:25:53] <Guest39> emm
[22:26:10] <Guest39> can you give an example
[22:26:14] <Guest39> access what?
[22:26:17] <xx> similarly if you access something that's clearly not work related during working hours - it's more likely that it currently isn't working hours time for you
[22:26:32] <Guest39> people often work from home and at work also access what ever :)
[22:26:34] <xx> all these little bits of info can be pieced together to make a guess of where you are
[22:26:39] <Guest39> impossible
[22:26:44] <Guest39> give at least one example
[22:26:46] <xx> well, that's how statistics work
[22:27:05] <Guest39> once more it is impossible
[22:27:22] <xx> Guest39: example? It's 4am in tokyo right now, so I'd guess you're not in japan.
[22:27:24] <Guest39> for example person access nytimes com
[22:27:34] <Guest39> how nytimes know person local time?
[22:28:40] <Guest39> it will not know - then how will it know if it's day or night time for that person?
[22:28:42] <Guest39> it won't
[22:29:32] <Guest39> also if people use mail2tor it is tor based no js email + pgp
[22:29:46] <Guest39> then such people identity is stealth
[22:32:02] <Guest39> style of writing can also be used to identified traitors such as government agents - using leaked facebook and other forums data
[22:33:03] <Guest39> then simply triangulate them and ...
[22:33:04] <Guest39> ;)
[22:36:36] <Guest39> also how site a and b correlate something using data such as time spent to read an article:)  simply save it and read offline
[22:36:59] <Guest39> once most tor users do it - again uniform anonymity :)
[22:37:46] <xx> every tor user behaves differently - that's the issue
[22:37:56] <Guest39> do they
[22:37:57] <xx> if everyone behaved the same, then there'd be little point to even using tor
[22:41:02] <Guest39> once persona behaviour falls withing normal tor behaviour range again  anonymous
[22:42:50] <Guest39> also something that have not been discussed openly central identity databases are not 100% secure and if backup servers are known new identities can be created
[22:43:09] <Guest39> how backup server can be identified. via variety of tactics
[22:44:05] <Guest39> that is why there is a worldwide push to adopt corona passport and blockchain based identity
[22:45:36] <Guest39> also people could should save articles on various topics so their interests can not be identified
[22:46:23] <Guest39> at very least use of tor browser significantly decreases profiling of individuals
[22:46:26] <xx> just don't do anything stupid over tor and you'll be fine
[22:46:52] <Guest39> i just hate how each site stuffs cookies lol
[22:47:27] <Guest39> they want to profile people interests and plug this data into social credit system
[22:58:29] <Guest39> is there a general privacy channel?
[22:59:50] <xx> there's #privacy
[22:59:57] <xx> but maybe you want #security
