[00:38:23] <yusa5142> Hello, I've this class for a cart model I want to set the id with uuid values with the code below
[00:38:24] <yusa5142> import uuid
[00:38:24] <yusa5142> class Cart(models.Model):
[00:38:25] <yusa5142>     id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
[00:38:25] <yusa5142>     created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
[00:38:26] <yusa5142> When I make migrations I get this message
[00:38:26] <yusa5142> It is impossible to add a non-nullable field 'id' to address without specifying a default. This is because the database needs something to populate existing rows.
[00:38:27] <yusa5142> I don't have any data in the card model in the database
[00:38:27] <yusa5142> How can I fix that ?
[00:43:07] <GinFuyou> If you don't have rows for that model you should be able to provide one-time dummy value
[00:43:46] <GinFuyou> or you could rollback migrations to before model was first added, so it doesn't have that problem
[00:46:27] *** Quits: llanhmod (~personnel@user/domhnall/x-2887755) (Quit: leaving)
[00:47:52] <yusa5142> so you suggest I define default with a dummy value ?
[00:49:39] <GinFuyou> it should work. But if you are in early dev state, or just in position to easily redo migrations, I'd do that as most safe option

[15:28:40] *** Joins: cmbengue (~Thunderbi@207.191.249.160)
[15:29:01] <GinFuyou> theprophet, good luck on the interview!
[15:29:47] <djangoloser> can anyone help me?
[15:29:49] <theprophet> GinFuyou thank you for helping me that day.
[15:31:18] <FunkyBob> djangoloser: you say you 'changed STATIC_ROOT '.... to what?
[15:31:29] <FunkyBob> you say you set heroku to _not_ collect static
[15:31:38] <FunkyBob> then there's no point setting STATIC_ROOT
[15:31:45] <FunkyBob> what instructions are you following for this?
[15:32:06] <djangoloser> BASE_DIR / 'staticfile'
[15:32:18] <djangoloser> i am following corey schaefer
[15:32:28] <FunkyBob> means nothing to me
[15:32:56] <FunkyBob> again, if you're not running collectstatic... setting STATIC_ROOT is irrelevant
[15:32:59] <GinFuyou> Does heroku serve static at all? First hits I get on search use AWS or serving with wsgi server (which is questionable)
[15:33:22] <djangoloser> i ran collectstatic locally then pished those to the heroku
[15:33:26] <FunkyBob> GinFuyou: originally it didn't... but I think they changed that
[15:33:29] <FunkyBob> also there's whitenoise
[15:33:35] <FunkyBob> djangoloser: why?
[15:33:40] <FunkyBob> what told you to do that?
[15:33:44] <FunkyBob> pushed to heroku _how?
[15:33:56] <djangoloser> git
[15:33:57] <FunkyBob> you need to provide details, instead of vague descriptions
[15:34:09] <FunkyBob> what did you do on heroku to make it serve your static files?
[15:34:22] <djangoloser> git add git commit git push origin main
[15:34:49] <FunkyBob> also, how are you running django on heroku?  gunicorn?
[15:34:56] <djangoloser> gunicorn
[15:35:03] <FunkyBob> do you have a link for thise corey wotsit's guide you're following?
[15:35:26] *** Quits: theprophet (~theprophe@85.114.228.184) (Quit: Client closed)
[15:36:14] <djangoloser> actually the pushing local stagic files to heroku isnt in coreys guide
[15:36:32] <djangoloser> i just read that in some site
[15:36:42] <FunkyBob> also
[15:36:52] <FunkyBob> why did you pick  this corey guide over the one in the heroku docs?

[15:39:41] <FunkyBob> well, any time you feel like providing the other details I asked for, we might be able to help
[15:39:51] <LordKalma> let's get division going: Rich text editor for django-admin: ckeditor or tinymce?
[15:40:09] <LordKalma> ckeditor I can't understand how to install plugins that aren't shipped with django-ckeditor
[15:40:24] *** Joins: beastDivision (~beastDivi@user/beastdivision)
[15:40:51] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: neither, stop treating admin like it's a management interface :P
[15:40:55] <FunkyBob> also, codemirror :)

[15:41:22] <LordKalma> FunkyBob, bah, I'm going to have to write a CMS? :D
[15:41:30] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/blob/master/Django_Blog/13-Deployment-Heroku/django_project/requirements.txt#L22
[15:41:49] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: that's kinda what django is for... a framework for web apps
[15:42:17] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: but a process centric interface for implementing your business logic?  yes, it's a good idea
[15:42:22] <LordKalma> fair fair
[15:42:33] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: admin is more of a DB Admin interface with escape hatches
[15:42:38] <FunkyBob> djangoloser: https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/blob/master/Django_Blog/13-Deployment-Heroku/django_project/requirements.txt#L22
[15:42:41] <LordKalma> yah, that's fair
[15:42:44] <FunkyBob> seems corey uses whitenoise
[15:42:54] <FunkyBob> djangoloser: did you configure that into  your projecct?
[15:43:01] <LordKalma> FunkyBob, some things are neat though. For example, my model is made with a pattern that uses a lot of FK-type relations
[15:43:01] <djangoloser> nope
[15:43:08] <LordKalma> and django-admin gives tyou a drop-down meny
[15:43:11] <djangoloser> in his videos he didnt do that
[15:43:13] <FunkyBob> djangoloser: there's your problem
[15:43:15] <LordKalma> *gives you a drop down menu
[15:43:22] <FunkyBob> djangoloser: well, it's in his list of requirements
[15:44:53] *** Quits: mattil (~mattil@helsinki.portalify.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:45:07] <LordKalma> heroku is free isn't it?
[15:45:15] <LordKalma> I already pay for a VPS sor I just docker it :P
[15:45:45] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: it has a free tier
[15:46:01] <FunkyBob> djangoloser: you need _something_ to serve your static assets... Django will not
[15:46:09] <FunkyBob> whitenoise is a tool to bodge that in
[15:46:29] <LordKalma> unless you want to deploy with the django built in server
[15:46:33] <LordKalma> DON'T ACTUALLY DO THAT
[15:46:35] <FunkyBob> i could also give you a uwsgi config that would do it fairly efficiently [and, more importnatly, NOT block your app worker threads when doing so]
[15:46:50] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: even then, with DEBUG=False it won't serve staticfiles
[15:47:09] <LordKalma> hehe good way to force people to not do it :p
[15:49:21] <LordKalma> speaking of nginx. Is there a way to reverse proxy it to gunicorn "transparently"
[15:49:32] <LordKalma> like no X-forwarded-from whatever BS
[15:49:48] <LordKalma> just "think you've received this from the origin"
[15:50:11] <FunkyBob> no, because gunicorn only speaks http
[15:50:25] <FunkyBob> that's where uwsgi has an advantage, speaking both FastCGI and uwsgi protocols
[15:50:55] <djangoloser> i have one more concern
[15:51:06] <djangoloser> how do i separate dev heroku and linode
[15:51:35] <djangoloser> is that possible?
[15:51:43] <LordKalma> FunkyBob, hum..... I did see something I about nginx able to just "alias" with uwsgi...
[15:51:52] <LordKalma> so I might want to use that instead
[15:51:56] <FunkyBob> djangoloser: umm... what?
[15:52:03] <djangoloser> like i want to be able to deploy to both heroku and linode
[15:52:10] <FunkyBob> ok
[15:52:17] <djangoloser> is that possible?
[15:52:18] <FunkyBob> very different deploy experiences there
[15:52:21] <LordKalma> don't both support shipping a docker image? :p
[15:52:22] <FunkyBob> sure, it's possible
[15:52:45] <FunkyBob> LordKalma: maybe?
[15:52:46] <FunkyBob> i dunno
[15:52:49] <djangoloser> whats the proper way to do this
[15:52:53] <FunkyBob> it's late... I should sleep
[15:52:59] <FunkyBob> djangoloser: "proper" depends on your priorities
[15:53:21] <LordKalma> FunkyBob, have a nice one, and thanks for the continued help
[15:53:31] <LordKalma> I'll look into uwsgi

[15:55:11] <LordKalma> speaking of
[15:55:19] <djangoloser> is the tinbrain one for me?
[15:55:22] <LordKalma> isn't django supposed to send an email when you create the super user account
[15:55:27] <LordKalma> because it didn't
[15:55:37] <LordKalma> and I'm afraid it doen't like my VPS uses STARTTLS

[16:11:54] <LordKalma> you might need to check the repos tags
[16:12:05] <LordKalma> Corey might split the steps of the tutorial in branches
[16:12:07] <LordKalma> or even folders

[21:29:58] <LordKalma> I'm wondering something
[21:30:09] <LordKalma> you've sold me on wagtail, but like
[21:30:24] <LordKalma> when does one use a wagtail model (page) and when does one use a garden variety model?
[21:30:42] <LordKalma> like, I might want very specific stuff being part of the CMS
[21:30:44] *** Joins: idontneedanick (~idontneed@h-85-24-184-105.A189.priv.bahnhof.se)
[21:30:51] <LordKalma> so that the "editor hat" can edit/add data
[21:31:11] <LordKalma> let's put it like this. If you had a webshop, wouldn't you want the product model be a "page"?
[21:34:22] <LordKalma> https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/reference/contrib/modeladmin/index.html#how-to-use
[21:34:28] <LordKalma> I think this is more in line with what I meant :)
[21:34:36] <dodo> LordKalma: wagtail is a cms, not a shop
[21:35:03] <dodo> LordKalma: that being said.. you might want a ProductPage too
[21:35:14] <LordKalma> i like that example better they give in the url I just linked
[21:35:28] <LordKalma> you might want a book to be a garden-variety model
[21:35:40] <LordKalma> (yes, you could have  BookDetailPage, let's ignore that)
[21:35:41] <dodo> that's what i'm saying
[21:35:59] <LordKalma> because, like, my point is
[21:36:15] <LordKalma> as ya'll keep saying django's admin is an  "html DB editor"
[21:36:25] <LordKalma> so for the "editor hat" you'd want to use wagtail CMS
[21:36:35] <LordKalma> given I'm too lazy to write the management system myself :) :D
[21:36:36] <dodo> yup
[21:36:55] <LordKalma> and so even garden-variety models, you'd want to support them in wagtail :)
[21:37:03] <LordKalma> and that pages answered my question somewhat :)

[21:38:05] <LordKalma> this is something I'm building
[21:38:20] <LordKalma> a model with lots of FK-type relations to bits and pieces
[21:38:25] <LordKalma> it's all very convenient in django-admin

[21:38:40] <LordKalma> I don't want to re-write that on my frontend :)
[21:38:42] <dodo> i mean.. you can get the same with a wagtail Page
[21:38:46] <LordKalma> yes,
[21:38:51] <LordKalma> but that was my question
[21:38:58] <LordKalma> do you make *everything* a wagtail page?
[21:39:04] <dodo> i don't
[21:39:09] <LordKalma> beause I don't want to call this thing a "page"
[21:39:12] <LordKalma> it's not a page
[21:39:14] <dodo> the benefit of being a wagtail is primarily the streamfield
[21:39:18] <LordKalma> is a "thing" whatever it is
[21:39:19] <dodo> to me at least
[21:39:36] <LordKalma> streamfield... I might want that, because I might want like an audio bits and pieces and etc
[21:39:52] <LordKalma> that was another thing, I here here some "free-form" fields for rich text, and a wagtail "page" would better
[21:39:57] <LordKalma> still annoys me to call it page :p
[21:40:07] <LordKalma> since it's a "thing" :p
[21:40:09] <LordKalma> but whatever
[21:40:09] <dodo> get over it?
[21:40:17] <LordKalma> hahahahah
[21:40:22] <LordKalma> I like how you think :p
[21:40:29] <dodo> i think they are pages because by default they are in the page tree
[21:40:56] <LordKalma> regardless, I have to test it, but I do hope wagtail emulates that screenshot I showed you
[21:40:58] <dodo> but you can just have containers in the tree too and stuff all your Page-objects in ther
[21:41:01] <dodo> ther

[21:41:28] <LordKalma> with very convenient "create, edit, delete" :D

[21:53:06] <LuxuryMode> I have a new model for which I am trying to make the migrations. I've added the app to list of `INSTALLED_APPS`. If I don't import the model in my `__init__.py` then no migrations are generated. If I do add the import, I get an error that `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet.` I've dealt with this before but don't remember how to resolve. Any ideas?
[21:53:30] <LordKalma> is the model in models.py?
[21:53:36] <LordKalma> how did you add the app to installed apps?

[22:06:27] <ktosiek> Ok :-D
[22:06:43] <LuxuryMode> LordKalma: strangely, I got it work once by specifying the app name `manage.py makemigrations <app_name>` and that worked. But I deleted the generated file (I didn't apply migrations yet or anything) because I wanted to add another field to the model. Now makemigrations won't generate anything
[22:06:54] <LordKalma> I asked: "Is there a way to reverse proxy it to gunicorn "transparently", like no X-forwarded-from whatever BS, just "think you've received this from the origin""
[22:07:10] <LordKalma> for which the answer was: "no, because gunicorn only speaks http; that's where uwsgi has an advantage, speaking both FastCGI and uwsgi protocols"
[22:07:58] <LordKalma> CC ktosiek
[22:08:05] <LordKalma> and GinFuyou 10x 0 would be still 0
[22:08:06] <LordKalma> :0
[22:08:11] <ktosiek> thanks, seen that
[22:08:11] <LordKalma> LuxuryMode, never encountered those problems, weird
[22:08:13] <GinFuyou> LuxuryMode, you didn't delete migrations/ or migrations/__init__.py by the way
[22:08:40] <GinFuyou> LordKalma, no, uwsgi has a really long list of available settings
[22:08:53] <LordKalma> I meant gunicorn
[22:09:07] <LuxuryMode> GinFuyou I actually did. I then recreated that dir and file and tried again. Still not generating anything.
[22:09:16] <ktosiek> I feel like uwsgi has a setting for anything that could be a constant
[22:09:30] <LordKalma> GinFuyou, the joke was that gunicorn is basically configure-less
[22:09:43] <LordKalma> so you can't have 10x the surface area
[22:09:49] <LordKalma> because 10x0=0
[22:09:57] <LuxuryMode> oh wait, I'm in a docker container and the migrations dir I created isn't appearing in the container filesystem ha
[22:10:19] <GinFuyou> I see, but jokes aside gunicorn is not a bad choice. uwsgi is just more robust and advanced
[22:10:36] <LordKalma> GinFuyou, I just have the use case of uwsgi, apparently
[22:10:44] <GinFuyou> Might be
[22:10:53] <LordKalma> because I don«t want to deal with X-forwarded headers
[22:11:07] <LordKalma> LuxuryMode, hahahaha docker crap, man
[22:11:17] <LordKalma> yhesterday I spent the afternoon debugging my config :D
[22:11:24] <LuxuryMode> Tell me about it
[22:11:33] <ktosiek> but uwsgi doesn't do the "green threads" magic gunicorn does, right?
[22:11:34] <LuxuryMode> It's there now though and still no migrations generated. I'm stumped.
[22:11:50] <LordKalma> LuxuryMode, open a shell in the container
[22:11:55] <LordKalma> and run the migration inside the container
[22:11:57] <LuxuryMode> Yep I'm in it

[22:15:52] <LuxuryMode> Ok I see the problem. I had a `OneToOneField` to a model that exists in an app from another package. If I remove that it works.Needs to be a `ForeignKey` I guess. Not sure how I was expecting that to work.
[22:16:30] <LordKalma> I like to think of FKs as references and my go-to
[22:16:36] <ktosiek> LuxuryMode: OneToOneField is not *exactly* one-to-one, it should work across apps
[22:16:47] <LuxuryMode> hmm
[22:16:50] <ktosiek> it's more like unique FK
[22:17:14] <LuxuryMode> right it's a ForeignKey with unique=True but the "reverse" side of the relation returns a single object
[22:17:58] <LuxuryMode> hmm so if 1:1 works across apps, what is going on here
[22:18:28] *** Joins: Haudegen (~quassel@178.115.237.87.static.drei.at)
[22:18:54] <LuxuryMode> oh it won't generate the migration with a ForeignKey either so the issue isn't 1:1 itself
[22:18:55] <LordKalma> maybe your 1:1 forces some invalid constraints
[22:18:58] <LordKalma> hum
[22:19:01] <LordKalma> care to share the error?
[22:19:12] <LuxuryMode> I also am loading my apps after the other app/package
[22:19:41] <LuxuryMode> There's actually no error. It just silently doesn't generate any migration.
[22:20:00] <LordKalma> but it does if you delete that field?
[22:20:30] <LordKalma> have you tried to `docker exec -it container /bin/bash` and run the python manage.py from there?
[22:20:33] <LordKalma> instead of diretly
[22:20:36] <LordKalma> so you see the output and all

[22:25:01] <LordKalma> hahahah
[22:25:27] <LordKalma> personally I'd vouch to forget PK and just let django use its thing

[22:27:20] <LordKalma> don't set anything manually as the pk
[22:27:26] <LordKalma> let django use the id number it likes to generate
[22:29:04] <LuxuryMode> Well, two things. 1) what I pasted above isn't *my* model, it's the model in another package I want to have a 1:1 field to 2) I believe the lack of uniqueness constraint is only an issue because in my `OneToOneField` I am specifying `to_field='registration_id'`. If I leave that off, it would just the id that Django automatically generated. The issue there is that I need clients to be able to address this model using the registration
[22:29:04] <LuxuryMode> id, not the ID
[22:30:28] <nbjoerg> you can always follow the joins
[22:30:44] <nbjoerg> (and hope that it is actually unique)
[22:31:36] <LuxuryMode> You mean just leave off `to_field=..` and when querying just use the `registration_id` which we are already treating as if it is unique?
