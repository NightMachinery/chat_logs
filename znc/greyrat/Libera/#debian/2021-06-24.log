[07:09:44] <chance2105> wr, Depends on what you mean by permanently, but there's a lot of VNC and RDP apps packaged in Debian
[07:09:55] <chance2105> wr, krdc comes to mind
[07:10:08] *** Joins: madez (~madez@ip-176-198-251-181.hsi05.unitymediagroup.de)
[07:10:13] <PMT> VNC would work. xrdp would work, I think (I've never used it). x2go is also a possibility. I believe there are even more less common options.
[07:10:50] *** Quits: ddsys (~ddsys@user/ddsys) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:11:03] <wr> chance2105, wanna remote desktop to my debian from anywhere and across reboots
[07:12:04] <orbatos[m]> wr: yes, nearly every service can be configured for this.
[07:12:43] <wr> orbatos[m], i know many can, but trying to find my best option, and easiest setup
[07:13:13] <orbatos[m]> best and easiest rarely align, but I'd suggest you start with vnc
[07:13:29] <wr> orbatos[m], which one?
[07:13:32] *** Quits: kathenas (~kathenas@2a02:c7f:e512:a500:6520:a782:87e7:fcb0) (Quit: Leaving)

[07:16:01] <wr> orbatos[m], in that case that was the one i was thinking in using, i am in doubt off main differences from x2go over vnc, and what is best?

[07:17:40] <orbatos[m]> x2go is based off of a different protocol, I'd say the biggest end user difference is that some desktops don't like it.
[07:18:29] <orbatos[m]> the nx protocol it uses is derived from nomachine's nx product
[07:20:10] *** Quits: jsrnop (~mark@user/jsrnop) (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[07:22:06] <orbatos[m]> wr: I do wonder what you are intending this for. "Best" is ephemeral and highly dependent on your use case.
[07:22:06] <orbatos[m]> e.g. Maybe you don't actually need a desktop, Is it possible working in a terminal is sufficient?
[07:22:23] <orbatos[m]> What about web based UI?
[07:22:28] <orbatos[m]> etc.
[07:22:36] <wr> orbatos[m], i use xfce or lxde
[07:23:54] <orbatos[m]> Ok, but again, why do you need a desktop by remote? There are good reasons, but perhaps this isn't one of them.
[07:25:47] <wr> orbatos[m], i always need it when the machines are far

[07:31:56] <orbatos[m]> ok, fair, in that case are you needing access to the UI, or files? If you simply need to continue work file access might be more convenient.
[07:31:56] <orbatos[m]> Note I'm asking because interactive remote desktop can be unreliable if consistent network access is limited or cannot be guaranteed. asynchronous methods can work around this.

[18:33:17] <PMT> You could try it, but I don't think it will necessarily save you, unless it's much more compressible than I expect.
[18:33:59] <ulu> would repartitioning with larger swap help?
[18:34:40] <PMT> Really, more RAM would help. You could try the userland OOM daemon, which I have heard makes wiser choices, but I have not personally tried it. But the fundamental problem is "you're using all your RAM"
[18:34:53] <PMT> (Assuming I'm right, of course.)
[18:35:20] <randall> ulu: What kind of device is this?
[18:35:21] <amacater> Which point release of Debian was this originally - the partitioning changed in 10.8 or so to provide 1GB of swap rather than 2 x RAM (I think).
[18:35:33] <amacater> Adding more swap _might_ help
[18:36:44] <amacater> But yes - add more RAM

[18:37:43] <amacater> So 1G swap, then.
[18:38:06] <randall> ulu: See above ^^^. testing support is on another network.
[18:38:22] <PMT> It probably won't hurt to try more swap, but I don't think it will ultimately resolve your issue.
[18:38:24] <amacater> tbf, that would also hit new installs on 10.9

[18:38:54] <ulu> randall, yes I asked that in the beginning here, i was told that if it is a generic problem, not specific to testing, ppl might be able to help me
[18:40:15] <randall> ulu: Sure, just pointing out that you'll get better help there, as you'll get answers there catered towards bullseye.
[18:40:44] <ulu> ok. so how much RAM does a typical laptop (used mainly for browsing and some baisc office work) need ?
[18:40:47] <randall> ulu: that being said, I'd reinstall, use LVM, and create a swap partition a bit larger than the RAM size so you'll be able to hibernate.
[18:41:10] *** Joins: nekobyte (~nekobyte@user/nekobit)
[18:41:12] <jelly> ulu, I'd go with 8GB RAM minimum if a web browser is to be used
[18:41:28] <jelly> 12-16 is better for future proofing 
[18:41:41] <randall> 4GB probably will work if you have a high pain tolerance.
[18:41:44] <PMT> The web is requiring ever-increasing resources.
[18:41:45] <jelly> zram+swap would help a bit
[18:42:06] <amacater> ulu: 8GB is (probably) the minimum but does depend on desktop - you might just get away with a lightweight desktop like XFCE.
[18:42:23] <amacater> GNOME/KDE are (fairly) heavy
[18:43:07] <jelly> KDE will work just fine with 8GB
[18:43:28] <jelly> I used it on stretch with 12GB more zram+swap 
[18:43:49] <jelly> and two web browsers with hundreds of tabs
[18:44:12] <PMT> I confess, I have not used that much RAM on a computer in a while.
[18:44:15] <amacater> As ever, your circumstances will be yours: if it's not a vital machine, take the opportunity to rebuild with larger swap
[18:44:38] <jelly> eh.  Don't let the system use swap on physical disk.

[18:45:05] <PMT> In general, that would be nice. In practice, that may be unavoidable depending on the limitations of the machine.
[18:45:18] <jelly> if HDD, things become unbearably slow quickly, and it's faster to just push the button and reboot than to wait for OOM
[18:45:38] <jelly> if SSD, you can kill your SSD if you let it be used for swap space for a couple months
[18:45:43] <jelly> ask me how I know!
[18:46:00] <ulu> yes it's not critical, so I am assessing whether it is cheaper to just buy a new laptop or try rescuing this one (for example by adding some RAM)

[18:46:11] <amacater> ulu: Yes, of course, if it's still HDD, switch to SSD and take appropriate precautions on swap
[18:46:19] <ulu> it is HDD

[18:47:27] <ulu> jelly, so what is the ideal swap partition size (the one on the HDD)?
[18:47:31] <amacater> If you can find more RAM/an SSD, you will really notice the difference. There's a 7 year old thinkpad next to me with RAM and SSD which made it fly. Now the screen has died :(
[18:47:37] <PMT> (One of them did die one day, but it was electrically indistinguishable from a brick, so I don't think that was related.)

[18:48:00] <jelly> ulu, you got it about right now
[18:48:51] <jelly> ulu, if you want to try getting more life out of this hardware, go install zram-tools and configure /etc/default/zramswap to allocate about 6GB zram swap.
[18:49:34] <jelly> ulu, how many cores does the CPU have?  Ideally you'd split the zram over (N-1) devices.

[18:51:11] <ratrace> jelly: it is. but compared to watching netflix, it's like 0.00001% of "harmful" unless you've got a swap storm :)
[18:51:46] <jelly> ratrace, that's exactly what linux kernel does when there's RAM pressure
[18:51:59] <jelly> lots and lots of small writes
[18:52:18] <ratrace> but the solution to that is "download moar ram". 
[18:52:30] <jelly> yes
[18:52:42] <jelly> and zram+swap is a surprisingly effective hack
[18:53:04] <PMT> I somewhat wish Linux would opt for a more integrated facility for compressed RAM.
[18:53:06] <jelly> if it didn't make the kernel slightly unstable I'd consider putting it on server instalations by default
[18:53:12] <ulu> jelly, 4 cores, I pasted lscpu here https://ghostbin.co/paste/nqr5
[18:53:40] <jelly> ulu, right, so you'd configure zram+swap for 3 devices 2GB each
