[00:05:35] <jim> hi... one more thing... what if I want there to -not- ignore a file in a different dir (somewhere inside the repo dir), but I would like to ignore a file of the same name in the same dir as the .git dir?
[00:05:48] <jim> is there a way to do that?
[00:06:23] <ikke> //filename
[00:06:25] <ikke> /filename
[00:06:44] <ikke> That would only ignore the file in the same directory as the .gitignore file
[00:06:58] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[00:07:13] <jim> so /filename would ignore the one in the same dir
[00:07:19] <ikke> yes
[00:07:38] <jim> thanks; appreciate your time
[00:10:57] <jim> does that imply there can be .gitignore files in other dirs of the same repo?
[00:13:12] <ikke> yes
[00:13:34] <jim> thanks again
[00:14:37] <ikke> .gitignore files in subdirectories only affect that directory and its children

[02:15:16] <ForeverNoob[m]> hi, in Gitlab, if I want to have a non-public repo, and if I want to git clone this repo to a new machine, the only way I can currently do this is with SSH authentication, is that correct?
[02:15:31] *** Quits: Guest3 (~Guest3@106.51.143.241) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[02:19:03] <Celeo> Does GitLab not support https authentication? I.e. you supply username & password in the terminal to authenticate the clone.
[02:20:01] <ForeverNoob[m]> I think they disable that if you give them your SSH pubkey, but I'll check.

[02:26:12] <ForeverNoob[m]> <BtbN> "ssh keys are just all around..." <- agree, but I'm not going to put my SSH privkeys on a new untrusted machine.
[02:26:37] <BtbN> If you move around private keys, you are doing private keys wrong anyway
[02:26:46] <ForeverNoob[m]> indeed
[02:26:58] <BtbN> And if you upload it to Github, you are doing ssh keys VERY wrong :D
[02:27:18] <ForeverNoob[m]> yeah that would be a major oopsie
[02:27:48] <BtbN> So, just generate a new keys for that machine and account. They are named username@machine by default for a reason
[02:28:59] <ForeverNoob[m]> but that would also mean that whoever is in control of those keys could also contribute commits to the Gitlab hosted repo, which is not something I'd want.
[02:29:29] <fikran> ForeverNoob[m]: I'm glad you're on Matrix. However I wish most IRC channels would officially just switch to Matrix.
[02:29:30] <BtbN> That's why you set a password on them.
[02:29:36] <fikran> IRC needs to make way for Matrix, IMO

[02:30:57] <ForeverNoob[m]> I mean, you could probably set a bunch of passwords on the SSH privkeys, but once they're on an untrusted machine all bets are off.
[02:31:15] <BtbN> The exact same goes for your password. In an even more severe way.

[02:31:31] <BtbN> If you don't trust the machine, don't put any credentials on there.
[02:31:44] <BtbN> ssh keys are the more secure option in either case though.
[02:32:18] <ForeverNoob[m]> So now you're all probably thinking... if I don't want SSH privkeys on untrusted machines, then why would I trust it with my Gitlab username and password? Well, I'm looking for a repo which isn't public but can be accessed from random machines via some trivial method of auth, mainly because... I don't want my code to be easily viewable by people because I suck at writing code lol
[02:32:53] <BtbN> Soo... make a semi-public ssh private key, and add it as read-only deploy key.

Being able to cherry-pick, then build, and if it fails

[04:47:49] <blahboybaz> BtbN: If I run into too much issues I won't know what to do about it. The only thing I do know how to do is start over
[04:48:26] <blahboybaz> I'll be ok I just wonder if I'm forming the command right. man git-rebase is huge and confusing
[04:48:26] <gitinfo> the git-rebase manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-rebase.html
[04:48:32] <blahboybaz> I know
[04:49:04] <BtbN> look at reflog, and hard reset to the commit before you started
[04:49:11] <BtbN> It's almost impossible to lose commited work
[04:49:13] <blahboybaz> When something is critically important to get right and not screw around about I want to ask and make sure I have it right. This isn't the time for experiments
[04:49:45] <BtbN> But really, your case is the most trivial rebase there is. Just rebase onto main. No wild flags around it, just rebase.
[04:50:46] <blahboybaz> I see -- thank God the man page deals with that topic clearly and at the top of the file

[04:51:29] <blahboybaz> For me it would be to be on the new branch lets call it development.. $ git rebase main development
[04:51:32] <blahboybaz> right?
[04:51:45] <blahboybaz> Would move development to the tip of main
[04:53:15] <blahboybaz> Yeah it works.. sorry for being so paranoid. Thanks for the guidance
[04:55:11] <fikran> is there a way to search for a string in all past commits? I am looking through some old code for a string that I removed but I want to know where/when
[04:55:31] <Peng> fikran: git log -G?
[04:55:38] * fikran googles that
[04:56:57] <fikran> what would a broader command be? :)
[04:57:31] <fikran> does it search commit messages? or code?
[04:59:22] <blahboybaz> Do I have to set my branches up for tracking upstream again? Since I moved them.  eg: $ git push -u origin development
[04:59:44] <blahboybaz> I did it once but then after the rebase does it have to be done again?

[11:18:01] <k8yun> sorry, learning git at the moment but when I run `git commit -a -m "added test file" && git push`, new local files should be pushed to the git server and the same file should exist on the git server, right?
[11:20:31] <ikke> git by default does not allow you to push to a branch that is checked out at the repository you are pushing to
[11:21:06] <j416> k8yun: think of it as commits, not files; if it were me, I'd start locally and skip the remote as you learn
[11:21:39] <ikke> yes, git is not a file sync application
[11:22:04] <j416> k8yun: you commit files to create a commit, you can inspect that locally (try "git show --stat"). push/fetch is just for sending/receiving objects (like commits) to/from a remote
[11:22:51] <j416> k8yun: git is distributed; you can use git for an entire project completely locally without every involving a remote server.

[14:39:36] <ikke> without -
[14:39:38] <ikke> without ?
[14:39:48] *** Joins: bindu (~bindu@user/bindu)
[14:40:30] <jim> ok, so if they do the fetch first, then when they checkout, the branch will go to the right place in the tree automatcially?
[14:40:57] <ikke> git sees that-branch does not exist locally, but there is exactly 1 remote tracking branch with the same name
[14:41:07] <ikke> so it will create a local branch based on that remote tracking branch
[14:43:56] <jim> so that must mean the remote tracking branch "knows" where to put the branch pointer initially
[14:44:42] <jim> and it must know, from the regular branch on the remote side?
[14:44:55] *** Quits: bindu (~bindu@user/bindu) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:45:31] <ikke> a branch is just a pointer to a commit
[14:45:45] <ikke> if you create a new branch based on another branch, both branches just point to the same commit
[14:46:06] *** Quits: vishal (~vishal@fedora/vishal) (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
[14:46:10] <jim> ok
[14:46:23] <jim> so that's what happens -locally-, yes?
[14:46:43] <ikke> yes
[14:47:42] <jim> so, I'm the owner of a repo, I create a branch on that local repo, switch to it, and commit a bunch of stuff...
[14:47:55] <jim> then, I push the branch to the remote.
[14:47:56] *** Joins: vishal (~vishal@fedora/vishal)
[14:49:37] <jim> so the first commit that occurred on that branch, points to an earlier commit that was posted to a different branch... say the commit hash was aaaaaa to make it easy (6 a's)
[14:49:52] *** Joins: bindu (~bindu@user/bindu)
[14:50:01] <jim> then, someone else, fetches the branch
[14:50:25] <jim> where does the first commit on that branch point to, its parent?
[14:51:04] <ikke> the same commit as you created it on
[14:51:11] <ikke> the parent of the commit is part of the commint
[14:51:13] <ikke> commit*
[14:52:08] <jim> so other-person would have to have the branch that I started the branch on
[14:54:27] <ikke> git fetch would get everything they need

[14:56:03] *** Joins: crabbedhaloablut (~crabbedha@user/crabbedhaloablut)
[14:56:38] <jim> because the other-person fetched the branch, its first commit would either have to have no parent (because they don't have the branch I branched off from), or would have that branch, and so would have commit aaaaaa (the commit on the other branch which is the parent of the first commit of the branch they fetched)
[14:57:49] <jim> (but this part of the discussion is moot, because in the real situation, I branched from master)
[15:00:13] <jim> (and the other-person who fetched the branch, has master)
[15:00:16] *** Joins: nullroute (~nullroute@209.141.45.45)
[15:00:24] <euouae> if they fetch B which branches from A, they should get A too I believe
[15:00:44] <euouae> I mean, branches are just pointers. so they'll get /at least/ a direct path from commit-HEAD to commit-ROOT
[15:01:01] <euouae> the pointer/label A may not be there, but they'll get "its contents"
[15:02:49] <jim> ok, and the correct way to do that is fetch/checkout
[15:03:42] <jim> and that's the correct way, whether they have checked out (some of) the branch before, or not
[15:03:51] <euouae> jim, this is a good article to understand better I think https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches

[15:08:06] <euouae> then bar can create a local branch XXX that tracks remote/XXX
[15:08:40] <euouae> when bar pushes to remote, you get their commits because (presumably) your local branch XXX also tracks remote/XXX

[20:01:13] <mehwork> oh wait, i guess that file just hadn't changed afterall, weird. Worked on another one

[20:07:08] <mehwork> "HEAD" just means the latest commit of whatever branch i'm checked out right?
[20:07:23] <mehwork> i've always just assumed that but never really thought much about it
[20:08:30] <ikke> It's whatever is checked out
[20:08:38] <ikke> in most cases, the branch
[20:08:44] <ikke> mehwork: try: cat .git/HEAD
[20:12:30] <mehwork> ref: refs/heads/my-branch
[20:12:59] <mehwork> so HEAD is the "tip" of whatever is checkedout, is probably more accurate to say?
[20:13:12] <mehwork> or:  HEAD is the latest commit of whatever is checked out?
[20:14:56] <ikke> there is nothing 'latest' about HEAD by definition
[20:15:14] <ikke> you can checkout an older commit and HEAD would point to that
[20:15:23] <mehwork> ah
[20:15:27] <ikke> It just represents what is checked out in the working tree
[20:16:14] <ikke> a branch points to the tip of the history of the branch
[20:16:29] <mehwork> so if i did 'git checkout <older commit>' and then ran git diff HEAD <newer or older commit hash> <path to file>  it's relative to what is checked out?
[20:16:44] <ikke> yes
[20:16:53] <mehwork> thanks, this is why i shouldn't assume

[23:36:28] <sydbarret> i didnt commit anything yet
[23:37:02] <ikke> if you did not commit the changes, and try to checkout another branch with different contents, git would complain
[23:37:40] <sydbarret> my question is if I commit and then move to master. which pipfile I will encounter?
[23:37:44] <sydbarret> the new one?
[23:38:23] <sydbarret> or the old one will still remain

[23:38:48] <sydbarret> I upgrade python version in the new one so pipfile and pipfile lock appear as to be commited
