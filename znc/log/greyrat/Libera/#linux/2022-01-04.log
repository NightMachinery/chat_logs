[01:11:37] <akonai_> takes more cpu power
[01:11:58] <mrfb> akonai_: okey, the data behind those claims?
[01:12:08] <tm512> hexnewbie: for me I think I want to keep using rsync for backups because being able to access the backups as normal files is probably more important
[01:12:10] <Sauvin> Eh, kinda stands to reason. btrfs does a lot more.
[01:12:19] *** Quits: Iamthehuman1 (~noname@user/iamthehuman) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[01:12:28] <akonai_> it's just my experience
[01:12:34] <akonai_> but it's definitely worth it imo
[01:12:43] <tm512> and not having my backups tied to a particular filesystem is important too
[01:12:45] <mrfb> well I think you are talking about placebo
[01:13:15] <mrfb> Sauvin: unless you use, for example, a very high compression algorithm, cpu usage is mostly the same
[01:13:19] <natewrench123456> Can you backup to 7zip archives?
[01:13:29] <mlu> don't overthink your backups: keep it damn simple
[01:13:40] <hexnewbie> tm512: Yeah, but the ZFS/Btrfs backups are in effect mountable filesystems. In ZFS you have a filesystem you can mount. I have not had to recover a btrfs backup yet, but I assume at worst if the snapshot is readonly, I might need to clone it into a non-read-only one
[01:13:41] <tm512> natewrench123456: 7zip archives aren't UNIX-friendly
[01:13:45] <mrfb> borgbackup
[01:14:01] <tm512> natewrench123456: using 7zip will strip all of the permission and ownership information of the files
[01:14:04] <mlu> if your fear is losing data, just take a few snapshots and put them somewhere physically separate (i.e. the cloud, some tapes)
[01:14:10] <mlu> tar is excellent :)
[01:14:15] <Sauvin> My backups are dead simple. $HOME gets dumped to a couple of externals. All the rest can be restored with a simple re-install.
[01:14:18] <mrfb> using zfs/btrfs snapshots as primary backup is a recipe for loosing data
[01:14:21] <tm512> natewrench123456: if you want LZMA compression for backups, use tar with xz or lzip
[01:14:21] <natewrench123456> again ZFS is not directly compatible with the linux kernel unless you have a buffer
[01:14:25] <hexnewbie> tm512: Plus, the backup is actually only for complete disaster recovery. You pull actual lost files from the snapshots themselves.
[01:14:27] <akonai_> mrfb: i have an older dual core processor so it's slightly noticeable in my case
[01:14:35] <mlu> the hard part is the ability to restore the backup
[01:14:41] <mlu> get too fancy, and your restore might not necessarily work
[01:14:49] <mlu> also, it's a waste to backup reproducible stuff
[01:14:58] <mrfb> akonai_: it may be because some reason we are not considering, like, if you have compression active
[01:14:58] <natewrench123456> backup files not apps
[01:15:33] <hexnewbie> natewrench123456: Where do I buy a buffer? 😜

[01:16:38] <tm512> hexnewbie: fair enough, but I think I'm fine using rsync to an external drive. only reason I see to switch to ZFS or btrfs is if I wanted the incremental backups as separate files so I could recreate a volume at a previous revision, whereas with rsync the only backup I have is the latest

By the way, do you happen to remember what you asked me to try as modifications in the grub file? there were 2 if I remember correctly
[01:30:38] <Gaboradon> So umm, it's been some time I last did Clonezilla image and did some manual disk imagin in live linux ... I need to do another backup image again, but I remember Clonezilla is a lot just about the configuration around the main utility, the main thing being DD/DDRescue/NTFSClone ... so I could as easily make it manually now in running linux, without having to shutdown, as I have other stuff open  I wish to finish.

[06:03:49] <Aarch64debian> beautiful and easy to use
[06:04:01] <oneadvent> ananke: hmmm, so should i set up a base linux install and then add guacamole using a guide online? or is there a better way?
[06:04:15] <Sauvin> Beauty depends on how much beer you've had, and ease of use depends on which side of the pole you're on.

[08:27:06] <mlu> the way I'd put it is that I'd feel comfortable to use refurbished drives to save a bit of money, but only as long as it doesn't store the only copy of any important data

[08:27:31] <mlu> i.e. it wouldn't be my primary drive on my desktop, but I'd happily put a refurbed drive into a RAID1/5/6
[08:27:44] <Dagmar> Yeah I've built 5's with refurbs
[08:27:46] <mlu> or if it was just for storing games on my gaming machine
[08:27:47] <Poboy> Sauvin, oh, quite a bit.  Enough time to start messing around with Vim, if that counts for anything
[08:28:00] <Dagmar> So long as it can't cause me downtime or dataloss, I'm okay with somewhat dubious provenance
[08:28:14] <mlu> honestly, I don't even bother testing them, but that's because I don't care enough to know how good they are
[08:28:18] <Sauvin> It counts. The terminal in Linux is similar, but there can be some subtle differences. Mac is a BSD, and Linux ain't. Stick around.

[08:30:15] <labrador> The BSD code present in XNU has been most recently synchronised with that from the FreeBSD kernel. Although much of it has been significantly modified, code sharing still occurs between Apple and the FreeBSD Project as of 2009

[08:32:28] <tm512> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU#Kernel_design it's definitely accurate to say it's derived from BSD, because it takes a lot from it

[10:22:59] <tscopp> you definitely want something _like_ ldap but I'd do a little looking to see if there was a lightweight version of it. Or even a low cost/free one on azure's cloud.
[10:23:06] <labrador> Client certificates are a more secure option too
[10:23:06] <Henry151> i might ditch airsonic for navidrome, i was just looking at it and it looks a lot smoother

[10:23:44] <Henry151> probably about 25 or 30
[10:24:07] <Henry151> I am also looking into using a backblaze bucket to host all the media
[10:24:13] <tscopp> ah, I was going to suggest being lazy and hand creating for the time being but that's enough to justify ldap or some sort of directory service.
[10:24:23] <labrador> Uh they are legal media right?

[10:25:14] <Logiar> "Short" summary of my adventures so far: First monday of the year started with /tmp not being writable, decided to restart to see if it would correct itself and got vmlinuz.efi not found. Spent entire yesterday trying to get my data out, couldn't mount old file system because some issue with the journal and fsck was getting write errors. Finally managed to get access to file by writing an image to
[10:25:16] <Logiar> external hdd, running fsck on that and mounting. Today I was planning on simply reinstalling the OS, but installer logs "Install error: disk commit error: failed to commit libparted changes to "/dev/sda": No such file or diretory (os error 2)" tried removing all partitions with gparted and getting "Input/output error during write on /dev/sda". Is there anything else I should try or is it time to
[10:25:16] <tscopp> yeah, I'd start with https://www.openldap.org/ unless you can find a better option
[10:25:18] <Logiar> accept that the disk is pretty much dead?

[11:02:28] <WickedDekciw> Heyo. Is there a generic way to find the uncompressed size of an archive without actually decompressing it? I've looked into this and most have dependencies on tar/gzip which aren't guaranteed to be filetypes I always deal with.

[11:03:10] <DaleGribble[m]> it will always depend on the archive type and what metadata it stores
[11:03:22] <ELQEYNN> any tar-gzipped archive is another file, isn't it?

[15:58:13] <obvs> so yeah its a pretty decent desktop :)
[15:58:45] <uwharrie> if you want to match only lower case ASCII words, you'd need a pattern like ^[[:lower:]]+$
[15:59:44] <obvs> MrElendig, most people buy ssd's wrong - they don't consider the performance ratings of read/writes at all and look at things like size. The real determining factor on the actual performance isn't the size at all - its the rated performance
[16:00:12] <MrElendig> rated performance and real life performance often differs a lot
[16:00:12] <uwharrie> i.e. specify that the entirety of the characters fall within the range, not 0 or more
[16:00:22] <obvs> Depends on the brand
[16:00:34] <MrElendig> how the firmware is tweaked will massively impact the performance
[16:00:35] <obvs> Samsung's ratings are pretty close to real world
[16:00:51] <vanessa> colo_work, that link mad me sad. stupid people adding stupid things to POSIX

[16:02:55] <jim> vanessa, [a-z] is a choice of a lot of characters, and . is a choice of any character other than \n
[16:03:09] <uwharrie> a pattern of [anything]* will always match, because it's specifying that 0 items in the class are considered a match

[16:04:30] <vanessa> but ^[a-z]*$ also matches everything
[16:05:03] <obvs> but yeah anyway the only points i was making is if you have an ssd that only delivers 2gb/sec, wow you bought a really terrible ssd or its old and that level of performance is expected.... maybe upgrade or buy more sensibly

[16:14:01] <hexnewbie> That's an odd issue. If you use FBReader with Linux Libertine O font on Debian 11, ligatures break text. ‘if’ becomes ‘fi‘ (i.e. ‘ﬁ’), ‘himself’ becomes ‘himsefl’ (i.e. ‘himseﬂ’), and I have no idea how to begin troubleshooting that. Obviously, changing to font to Linux Biolinum O seems like a nice fix.

[16:49:15] <hexnewbie> msiism: Kate has tools for wrapping, but it's less good than vim's. It doesn't reformat your whole paragraph unless you explicitly trigger it (so no reformat-as-you-type like vim tcqa except at the end of the paragraph), and deals with indented paragraphs badly.

[17:30:31] <phogg> alexandre[m]: if you just need some extra space then I suggest you (0) create an LVM volume group out of your new disk, (1) make some LVs for where you need space, (2) migration specific dir trees.

[17:32:09] <hexnewbie> alexandre[m]: Boot from live media, dd bs=1M if=oldSSD off=newSSD, *DOUBLE CHECK* before hitting enter the destination is correct, remove old SSD.

[17:43:25] <hexnewbie> Dagmar: The unique partition UUID of the ESP (from the partition table) is stored in the firmware, so if you didn't preserve it when mkfs.vfat was ran, and you didn't use grub-install --force-extra-removable, the motherboard will *not* know how to boot anything off of it

[17:44:20] <phogg> alexandre[m]: LVM would let you boot up, add the new disk as a physical volume to your existing volume group, and then just lvextend whichever logical volumes need more space. Done.
[17:44:36] <hexnewbie> duik: You have to ask the manufacturer or someone about the specific model, but I didn't say “make a USB” (bootable, presumably).

[17:45:11] <hexnewbie> Dagmar: I think that's what --force-extra-removable is supposed to do, but I'm not even that works always (particularly when the disk is not actually removable)

[17:46:33] <phogg> Khaytsus: LVM has some kind of thin provisioning support. I understand it's not the greatest, but again it's solving a harder problem.
[17:46:36] <alexandre[m]> (in the sense of being able to put drives online/offline without the filesystem noticing)
[17:46:44] <phogg> alexandre[m]: LVM *can* let you RAID, but I never use it for that

[17:48:10] <phogg> Khaytsus: They do it intentionally and I *thoroughly* disagree with the line of reasoning that says it's a good idea, even if it does yield useful results more easily.
[17:48:12] <alexandre[m]> there's no way to put an existing ext4 partition in LVM without having to move data all around,right?
[17:48:16] <hexnewbie> Both have different brand of reliability issues (ZFS *prefers* you to lose data over serving you any corruption, btrfs has had a very troublesome history of breaking badly), and COW makes a lot of I/O operations way slower. But that works better than LVM snapshots.

[17:49:35] <drivux> Hi all. I'm an happy ex Windows now Linux user, but there is an utility that I can't replace so far: 7-zip. I have the 7zip archive support in Ark, but what I'm looking for is the versatility of that utility. It can open every archive, iso file, etc. Just a double click on a file an 7zip can open it. How can I achieve this in Linux?
[17:49:54] <phogg> alexandre[m]: if you just want more space you can use mount (parts of) the new disk in places you need that space. That's the least amount of work (and could be least downtime).
[17:50:11] <Dagmar> drivux: You can install whatever DE you're currently using
[17:50:14] <peetaur> I'm half in agreement with both sides... I think the "everything does one thing well" concept can apply if they just make the fs do some callbacks/hooks into the mdadm and other layers instead of mashing the layers together into a mess.
[17:50:27] <Dagmar> drivux: Most of the desktop environments have a multi-archive extractor already

[17:50:51] <hexnewbie> drivux: 7z and unar can extract anything from the command line, GUIs like Krusader and TUIs like mc support archives through tools such as 7z

[17:52:20] <phogg> drivux: there are a multitude of command line multi-archiver wrapper tools out there. There are also lots of graphical ones. WHat you need is to find one you like, then configure your graphical file manager to allow easy access to it.

[22:49:14] <Peter1> Instead of this:  sha256hash AA.zip  How do i do it corectly?

[23:06:06] <alexandre[m]> hi, i made a script to continuously ddrescue and then eject a dvd (backing up my dvd collection), problem is that on some dvds that are a bit more scratched ddrescue says there's no media (they just take a bit longer to recognize) and the 15 second delay i had is not enough. Any way to wait for a disc to be detected and then run ddrescue on it?
[23:06:54] *** Joins: pap_ (~pap@athedsl-384810.home.otenet.gr)

[23:11:30] <ananke> alexandre[m]: so this just waits 15 seconds _after_ it runs ddrescue and eject the disk. it's broken by design, since it doesn't account for the time you spend on swapping disks
[23:12:11] *** Quits: samgranieri (~samgranie@user/samgranieri) (Quit: samgranieri)
[23:12:53] <alexandre[m]> anake, well, that would be included in the 15 seconds (i take 5 seconds if that much to swap the disc)

[23:14:02] <ananke> alexandre[m]: there's 'setcd' program which may provide you info on whether there's a disk in the tray
[23:14:28] <phogg> alexandre[m]: the 15 seconds is *after* ddrescue, so what's the problem? There is no disc being read at that time

[23:17:06] <ananke> alexandre[m]: then you can add however much sleep after the fact, before ddrescue

[23:17:39] <ananke> alexandre[m]: what reading?
[23:17:40] <phinxy> Does ubuntu have services that can interfere with me trying to set up a bridge between two interfaces? I've stopped network manager.  There is a 'networking' service what does that do?
[23:18:05] <phogg> alexandre[m]: better to use setcd if you can

[23:18:54] <phogg> there is some time spent spinning up the disc and reading its metadata, more if the disc is damaged

[23:56:31] <phogg> not this one, as far as I know, but if you're in others they would block the change

[23:58:46] <hexnewbie> Also, channels in which you are banned, also block you from changing nicks

[23:59:37] <hexnewbie> So best *punishment* for offending nick would be to ban nick!*@*, and not kick them.
