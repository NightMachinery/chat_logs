[00:03:06] <Z-module> So you see why product and box topologies are identical when there are just finitely many factors, right?
[00:03:30] *** Joins: stanrifkin (~stanrifki@p200300dbcf0bdd00df92678619f2bdb6.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[00:03:44] <cuppajoeman> Yeah I see why
[00:04:04] <cuppajoeman> Because considering a product of the product topology each of the sets involved in the product are open
[00:04:35] <cuppajoeman> And considering the other way, a product from the box topology is just a finite number of open sets so we can allow that type of product in the product topology?
[00:05:09] <Z-module> well, even for infinitely many factors in some other degenerates cases too, like when at least one factor is the empty space (so that the entire cartesian product is also empty), or when all but finitely many of the factors are indiscreet spaces. But those don't really come up in practice.
[00:05:47] <cuppajoeman> Ok I l at least get the definition to some degree
[00:06:02] <cuppajoeman> What would be the product topology on R^w even look like?
[00:06:58] <cuppajoeman> I know a basis for the product topology is the collection of arbitrary unions of these products: https://i.imgur.com/pMUvpy5.png
[00:07:19] <Z-module> the open sets are arbitrary unions of finite intersections of "slices", where a slice is anything of the form  R x R x ... x R x U x R x R x ...  where U is an open set in R

[05:27:39] <isekaijin> That is my suspicion as well.
[05:27:50] <damo22_> twJizhan: if you delete countably many points from R the limits still exist as you approach each missing point?
[05:27:55] <isekaijin> Like, if there were a purely topological characterization, you could be it would be in all textbooks.
[05:29:54] <twJizhan> uh i take R to simplify what i am unsure in reading a proof
[05:30:26] <Z-module> by the way twJizhan, for X = R^n with any countable set removed, X has a topologically *equivalent* metric with respect to which X is complete.
[05:31:06] <damo22_> does this relate to borel sets?
[05:32:12] * PlanckWalk tries to imagine a topologically equivalent metric on the irrationals that is complete.
[05:32:36] <twJizhan> okay the proof assumes implicitly that "uncountable complete metric space deleting any one point is (Cauchy-incomplete"
[05:33:09] <PlanckWalk> twJizhan: Without further context, that's false.
[05:33:15] <PlanckWalk> What's the context?
[05:33:36] <isekaijin> twJizhan: Any s
[05:33:51] <isekaijin> twJizhan: Any infinite set can be equipped with the discrete metric where d(x,y) = 0 for each pair of distinct points x and y.
[05:34:00] <isekaijin> twJizhan: And this space remains complete no matter how many points you remove.

[10:50:19] <stanrifkin_> application of rules to calculate something.
[10:50:23] <stanrifkin_> like chess for example
[10:51:53] <pyzozord> so algebra should be a calculus if it is just an "applicaiton of rules"
[10:52:23] <pyzozord> pretty much every branch of math should be a calculus, no? Every branch has rules

[11:19:47] <rubiksdream> the proof of the result is by means of showing the mean value property holds on the boundary (since it holding in Omega+ and Omega- is basically immediate)
[11:20:01] <rubiksdream> and it holds on the boundary precisely because of the - sign
[11:20:21] <rubiksdream> we need the integral over a circle centred at a boundary point to evaluate to zero, and the - sign ensures this

[11:29:29] <rubiksdream> the contradiction is that g should be positive everywhere in Omega
[11:29:33] <riv> so the spheres are higher dimensional version of the integers?
[11:29:43] <rubiksdream> but by the reflection principle we can show it is negative at points of Omega
[11:30:34] <rubiksdream> so this seems to imply the initial assumption that there is a solution to dirichlet problem on Omega with boundary values log|z| is false
[11:30:41] <rubiksdream> but according to the theorem I have screenshotted, this is not false

[12:30:02] <greenbagels> Right, exactly

[16:28:26] <isekaijin> The Jordan normal form of a non-diagonalizable matrix is in some sense “less canonical” than the diagonalization of a diagonalizable matrix, right?
[16:28:45] <Franciman> t-they coincide IIUC
[16:28:54] <isekaijin> Suppose your matrix entries are physical quantities. All of the same dimesnsion, for the sake of simplicity.
[16:29:17] <Franciman> the jordan normal form is for when you can't diagonalize, otherwise you get the same result
[16:29:19] <Franciman> last time I checked
[16:29:25] <Franciman> maybe I refer to something else
[16:29:29] <isekaijin> Then how do you decide which value is 1? One meter? One kilometer? One light year?
[16:30:17] *** Quits: Macuser (~Macuser@216.30.159.201) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[16:30:26] <isekaijin> The Jordan normal form of a matrix whose entries are (for example) distances depends on the units in which the matrix entries are given.
[16:30:30] <isekaijin> This does not seem very canonical to me.
[16:31:31] <isekaijin> It would be more canonical if you allowed the superdiagonal of each Jordan block to contain some arbitrary value, not necessarily 1.
[16:32:20] <savask> isekaijin: What do you mean by "depends on units"?
[16:33:12] <isekaijin> Let M be a matrix whose entries are distances given in meters. Let N be the same matrix, rescaled so that its units are given in kilometers.
[16:33:12] *** Joins: anttt (~user@n122-111-150-83.meb4.vic.optusnet.com.au)
[16:33:20] <isekaijin> Then M and N are just related by the unit conversion factor.
[16:33:28] <isekaijin> But J(M) and J(N) are not related by a unit conversion factor.
[16:33:57] <savask> isekaijin: So, essentially, your problem is that Jordan normal forms of M and 1000*M are different?
[16:33:59] <isekaijin> Because the superdiagonal in J(M) is full of “1 meter”, whereas the superdiagonal in J(N) is full of “1 kilometer”.
[16:34:14] <isekaijin> Yes.
[16:34:26] <isekaijin> I would not mind if the superdiagonal could contain an arbitrary value.
[16:34:51] <isekaijin> Then we could say that a possible value of J(M) is related to a possible value of J(N) by a unit conversion factor.
[16:37:21] <isekaijin> The intuition that I get from the fundamental theorem of modules on PIDs, applied to the principal domain k[X], is that the eigenspace within each Jordan block should be thought of as “finite”, whereas the other directions should be thought of as “infinitesimal”.
[16:37:41] <cherim> Jordan normal form is for the case of operators on a vector space, mapping vectors to vectors
[16:38:04] <cherim> It won't arise in physical context where the operator has a nontrivial dimension
[16:39:26] <cherim> If domain and codomain have different dimensions, you typically can choose bases independently and get SVD or such instead of Jordan form

[18:17:56] <Z-module> I think it's true in a T_1 space too, but whatever.
[18:19:10] <Z-module> So, start with any limit point y of  A cup A' , meaning every open set around y contains some point of (A cup A')\{y}
[18:19:30] <Z-module> Try to show that y is in  A cup A'
[18:20:36] <savask> Z-module: Learned this (weird in my opinion) fact today. You know how every finite simple group is generated by almost all pairs of elements? Obviously it can't be generated by a pair of involutions, but it seems logical that if you take an involution from each conjugacy class of involutions, then they must generate the whole group

[18:33:27] <cuppajoeman> Ok, so you're proof structure is that you want to show that cl(A') = A', using the fact that cl(A') = A'' U A', which will give us what we need so long as A'' is a subset of A' ?

[19:05:02] <Z-module> In other words, apply the first thing using K = A'
[19:05:58] <Z-module> And showing that any limit of of A' in A' means:  any limit point of A' is also a limit point of A

[19:25:33] <qergle> until you hit 41

[19:25:59] <Guest38> True, thanks...
[19:26:23] <qergle> but it's prime for k from 1 to 40

[19:27:47] <Franciman> cuppajoeman: Hausdorff implies that points are closed
[19:27:48] <Franciman> i.e.
[19:27:51] <Z-module> There are some in *five* variables which, when you let those variables range over Z, all the positive results are prime.
[19:27:52] <Franciman> {x} is a closed set
[19:27:58] <qergle> Guest38: there's a very strong connection between the Riemann *hypothesis* and prime numbers (not the zeta)
[19:28:08] <Franciman> so X - {x} is an open set

[19:40:51] <Franciman> there is another way of defining open sets that is closely related to that thing, but that is not recursive
[19:40:54] <cuppajoeman> For me, the definition of V open wrt to a topology T is just that V in T ?
[19:41:06] <Franciman> i.e. B is open iff. every x \in B is internal to B
[19:41:16] <Franciman> so you can see that you can define what being internal to B means
[19:41:22] <Franciman> and you get back the definition of open set
[19:41:26] <Franciman> and viceversa you can define open sets
[19:41:29] <cuppajoeman> is my definition good?
[19:41:31] <Franciman> and get back a definition of internal point
[19:41:40] <Franciman> cuppajoeman: it's top notch
[19:41:53] <Franciman> if you want, we can go ahead and prove the aboe equivalence together it is really easy
[19:41:53] <cuppajoeman> ok
[19:42:00] <cuppajoeman> ok sure
[19:42:05] <Franciman> suppose B is open
[19:42:09] <Franciman> the for all x \in B
[19:42:11] <Franciman> you choose B
[19:42:13] <Franciman> ahah
[19:42:16] <Franciman> it's stupidly easy
[19:42:17] <Franciman> viceversa
[19:42:32] <Franciman> suppose for each x \in B there is an open set V fully contained in B
[19:42:36] <Franciman> and x \in V
[19:42:41] <Franciman> then B is a union of open sets
[19:43:40] <Franciman> (a little bit more detail, denote V_x the above mentioned open set, then B = \Cup\over{x \in B} V_x
[19:43:52] <Franciman> so B is union of all the V_x)
[19:44:31] <cuppajoeman> Ok, so we showed that B is open iff for every x in B there is some open set U subset B with x in it?
[19:44:42] <Franciman> hell yeah
[19:44:47] <Franciman> it is just a theorem
[19:44:53] <cuppajoeman> got it
[19:44:58] <cuppajoeman> and they're using this
[19:45:17] <Franciman> yes, you just need to understand what it means to be in X - A'
[19:45:39] <Franciman> x \in X - A' iff x \notin A' iff x is not a limit point of A'
[19:45:43] <Franciman> err
[19:45:47] <Franciman> x is not a limit point of A
[19:46:13] <Franciman> so if you find a whole open set U that does not contain any limit point of A
[19:46:15] <cuppajoeman> right so that means there is some neighborhood of x which intersects A with at most x itself
[19:46:17] <Franciman> it will be a subset of X - A'
[19:46:36] <cuppajoeman> Ok I see
[19:46:45] <Franciman> now which x are you referring to?
[19:46:50] <Franciman> it picks an x \in X - A'
[19:47:12] <Franciman> in that case you want to prove that if x is not a limit point
[19:47:14] <Franciman> of A
[19:47:20] <Franciman> you can find a whole neighborhood of x
[19:47:25] <Franciman> node made of limit points of A
[19:47:32] <Franciman> so x is really _apart_ from A
[19:48:07] <cuppajoeman> Wait, we say that x is a limit point of A, if for any neighborhood U of x, it intersects A in some other point than x
[19:48:22] <cuppajoeman> so if x is not a limit point of A, then x could be in A?
[19:48:38] <Franciman> yes it could

[20:56:38] <cuppajoeman> I think each of of these sets is infinitely countable
[20:56:54] <cuppajoeman> So their union is infinitely countable
[20:56:58] <Z-module> well, only k > 1 so this set is disjoint from Z, but you do get (this set)' = Z , yes, but those are the same cardinality.
[20:56:59] <cuppajoeman> and then N is infinitely countable
[20:57:27] <cuppajoeman> Right, so that could be a solution to |X'| = |X|
[20:58:35] <cuppajoeman> The other one seems hard
[20:58:51] <cuppajoeman> If I could do something similar for each real number?

[20:59:41] <cuppajoeman> What about Q itself
[20:59:51] <Z-module> no,  Q' = R , not disjoint from Q
[21:00:13] <cuppajoeman> right
[21:00:33] <cuppajoeman> For |X'| > |X| does it imply that X' is uncountable?
[21:00:55] <cuppajoeman> The limit points of a finite set is empty?\
[21:01:03] <cuppajoeman> I think that's true
[21:03:41] <Z-module> yes
[21:04:07] <Z-module> every finite X has X' = {}, so X is at least countably finite, so any larger cardinality than |X| is uncountable

[21:39:58] <isekaijin> It is just easier to account for all invariant subspaces if we use the latter.
[21:40:21] <isekaijin> Are invariant lines that special among invariant subspaces?

[21:41:45] <cherim> But you don't get any choice. Either they are in K or not. If not, then they are in an extension and you get your K[X]?
[21:43:02] <isekaijin> What I want to find is a decomposition V = V1 (+) V2 (+) ... (+) Vm where each Vi is an invariant subspace that cannot be further decomposed into a direct sum of invariant subspaces.
[21:43:20] <isekaijin> At least I think this is the most natural thing to do.
[21:43:59] <cherim> If your field is not algebraically closed and you need the general picture -- say, for counting, -- then indeed the summation goes over irreducible polynomials
[21:44:05] <isekaijin> In the sense that it does not behave weirdly in corner cases (e.g., the dimension of the direct sum drops when your linear operator is not diagonalizable.)

[21:50:13] <Z-module> well, c is an eigenvalue of M if  Mv = cv  for some nonzero vector v.  So c really needs to be in the scalar field.
[21:50:29] <isekaijin> We teach complex numbers to engineering students, but not to economics students.

[21:52:53] <qergle> surely when economics students are doing arma processes or differential equations to establish model equilibria they're using complex numbers.
[21:53:09] <Z-module> yeah, there's  really not much good reason to avoid C
