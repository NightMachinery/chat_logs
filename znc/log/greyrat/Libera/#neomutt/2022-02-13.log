[15:39:03] <dcpurton> there's already a lib.h

[15:41:45] <flatcap> yes, that'll be fine
[15:43:35] <flatcap> (X/lib.h is the general entry point for each library)
[15:44:40] <flatcap> Last night, I started making notes for a "How to add a..." : file, function, library, etc
[15:45:23] <dcpurton> I notice the c files have a @page documentation section
[15:45:34] <dcpurton> what would be appropriate for lib.c?
[15:46:46] <flatcap> yes, every .c has an @file and an @page
[15:47:06] <flatcap> it's a bit repetitive, but it means doxygen can do a nice jb

[16:21:17] <dcpurton> I thought so - try again
[16:22:04] <dcpurton> still doesn't work
[16:22:18] <flatcap> ok.  it's the linking order
[16:23:28] <flatcap> when files are compiled, they can have unresolved symbols which will be fulfilled by the libraries
[16:23:44] <flatcap> have a look at Makefile.autosetup ~L760
[16:24:33] <flatcap> $(LIBATTACH) is in the middle.  I suspect something after that depends on it
[16:25:21] <flatcap> it's a bit of a fine balancing act to get the order right
[16:25:49] <flatcap> in a perfect world, the source and libraries would have nice clean (orderable) dependencies
[16:26:56] <dcpurton> $(LIBCOMPOSE) is after $(LIBATTACH) 
[16:27:35] <flatcap> ah, try moving it before
[16:35:32] <dcpurton> if I also move $(LIBSEND) along with $(LIBCOMPOSE) it works
