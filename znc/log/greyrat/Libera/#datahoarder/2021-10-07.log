[01:30:33] <Fiji> lol im jk
[01:30:45] <Fiji> i'd pirate it but dont care enough, all the useful data so far has been leaked
[01:30:50] <evilgohan2> Eh, it was posted here earlier so I'm just reposting lol
[01:30:53] <Fiji> curious what the subsequent releases are
[01:31:00] <Fiji> nice, thankyou though evilgohan2 :)
[01:31:12] <Fiji> btw gohan was my favorite zfighter
[01:31:13] <evilgohan2> tbh, I'm kinda tickled by the people who are posting twitch salaries like its surprising
[01:31:28] <evilgohan2> $4.99 x y (where y is equal to number subscribers) = revenue
[01:31:44] <evilgohan2> Assume a 20% cut to Twitch (or whatever they take) and you've got someone's monthly income
[01:31:50] <evilgohan2> side note: mine too lol
[01:31:54] <evilgohan2> (if it ain't obvious)
[01:31:57] <unfinity> ・゜゜・ ​ 。。・゜゜\_O​< F​LAP FLAP!
[01:31:59] <Fiji> they take 30-50% cut
[01:31:59] <evilgohan2> ,bef
[01:31:59] <unfinity> evilgohan2 you befriended a duck in 2.464 seconds! You have made friends with 188 ducks in #datahoarder.
[01:32:00] <Fiji> ,bef
[01:32:00] <unfinity> You tried befriending a non-existent duck. That's freaking creepy.
[01:32:03] <Fiji> gross
[01:32:19] <evilgohan2> 30-50? So yeah. Assuming someone has... say... 20,000 subscribers
[01:32:27] <Fiji> yeah but you didnt include things like bits, sub count alone is just the floor
[01:32:42] <Fiji> 20k subscribers is just during that month, hrad to know month to month numbers i guess
[01:32:44] <evilgohan2> true
[01:32:45] <evilgohan2> I mean
[01:32:51] <evilgohan2> there's also the shady deals that happen
[01:32:53] <evilgohan2> sponsorships
[01:32:54] <evilgohan2> etc.
[01:32:56] <Fiji> yeah sponsorships too
[01:33:00] <Fiji> your point is still valid
[01:33:06] <Fiji> youd have to be a moron to think they werent making bank

[03:21:34] <rawktucc> 18TBs came in https://litter.catbox.moe/owqrfr.jpg
[03:21:55] <rawktucc> so it was packing peanuts on the bottom, foam whatever kind. Big bubble wrap around HDDs. HDDs separated!!!!!!!!! wtf!!!! by big foam chunk there
[03:21:59] <rawktucc> like, does this seem safe
[03:22:42] <joepie91> lmao that was definitely someone's spare drive pile they wanted to get rid of
[03:22:47] <evilgohan2> wow. Some of the better packing of OEM drives I've ever seen.
[03:22:50] <rawktucc> they're NEW new drives
[03:22:58] <rawktucc> legitimate new joepie91 
[03:23:04] <joepie91> oh yeah I know
[03:23:09] <rawktucc> same guy listed ANOTHER ONE too
[03:23:11] <rawktucc> i might buy it
[03:23:12] <evilgohan2> I stand by my statement.
[03:23:12] <joepie91> still probably came from a spare pile
[03:23:20] <evilgohan2> It's some of the best packing I've ever seen
[03:23:23] <joepie91> if it's packed like that
[03:23:25] <joepie91> just never opened
[03:23:39] <rawktucc> photo showed never opened
[03:23:45] <rawktucc> im trying to deside how to badblocks test this
[03:23:47] <evilgohan2> foam separator. Individual wrapped anti-static bagged drives
[03:23:54] <evilgohan2> wrapped in bubblewrap
[03:23:57] <rawktucc> oem sealed
[03:24:04] <evilgohan2> packed in peanuts
[03:24:08] <joepie91> the second-hand Dell Latitude I bought a couple years ago came from a similar pile, I suspect. it wasn't in packaging anymore but it looked too brand new (despite being an outdated model) to have ever been actually used
[03:24:11] <evilgohan2> shit, this is some gourmet shit
[03:24:23] <joepie91> probably some IT dept's unused spares
[03:26:15] <evilgohan2> thinking back on the time I ordered 5x WD 4.0TB REDs from Newegg.
[03:26:20] <evilgohan2> All passed SMART short / long tests
[03:26:25] <evilgohan2> all passed block tests.
[03:26:28] <evilgohan2> all passed stress test
[03:26:35] <evilgohan2> But 1 was a bad drive anyway.
[03:26:44] <evilgohan2> I didn't realize it till files started disappearing off the array.
[03:28:58] <evilgohan2> ended up RMA'ing. Newegg wanted to charge me to ship it. Told them to get f'd. Got a shipping label in minutes.

[16:57:37] <joepie91> it whitewashes what it actually is
[16:57:42] <joepie91> namely, anti-abortion
[16:57:49] <unfinity> ・゜゜・。 ​ 。・゜゜\_​ó< q​uack!
[16:57:52] <joepie91> ,bef
[16:57:52] <unfinity> joepie91 you befriended a duck in 3.282 seconds! You have made friends with 201 ducks in #datahoarder.
[16:57:59] <joepie91> "pro-life" is just a propagandic name for it
[17:05:29] <G0d> Also there are certain things that should really be left to people who know and understand to decide upon
[17:05:51] <cirdan> pro-life = anti-woman
[17:06:27] <G0d> I have no idea where I am on am on the intelligence spectrum, imagine my expertise being used to make decisions on stuff I don't fully understand
[17:09:30] <cirdan> we should let the people being affected make the decision for themselves. pro-life? sure you're free to grow the accidental parasite in your body until it can be born and survive on it's own. not ready for that? that's ok too!
[17:09:45] <cirdan> i want to see pro-life people protesting cancer treatment
[17:10:09] <cirdan> and not use any bug sprays/poison
[17:10:31] <cirdan> and be vegan
[17:10:51] <cirdan> otherwise they're not pro-life, they're full of shit
[17:11:06] <cirdan> george carlin has some great thoughts on this
[17:11:24] <joepie91> G0d: "intelligence spectrum" is bullshit anyway (and I'm saying that as someone who scores very highly on conventional IQ tests), it doesn't tell you anything about what someone's knowledge or skills are, or even how competent they are at decisionmaking
[17:11:34] *** Quits: Hackerpcs (~user@user/hackerpcs) (Quit: Hackerpcs)
[17:11:39] <cirdan> joepie91: this is very true
[17:11:56] <joepie91> if anything, 'intelligent' people have an incredible capability of wrongly assuming that they are good at everything and fucking shit up
[17:12:23] <G0d> true
[17:12:49] *** Joins: Hackerpcs (~user@user/hackerpcs)
[17:13:05] <cirdan> sure, and they don't care about the effects of their policy, not on a personal level
[17:14:00] <G0d> Why we even on this subject anyway?  Someone ask about backing up Fetus's?
[17:14:25] <cirdan> so how about that twitch leak
[17:14:58] <cirdan> for some reason my machine hangs when moving a fishined torrent to my NAS and any process that touches that directory via smb hangs
[17:15:03] <cirdan> it's really weird
[17:15:06] <G0d> I don't think I've ever watched a twitch, amazing that there are people out there bringing so much value
[17:16:31] <ThePendulum> joepie91: I can agree with anti abortion, I think the issue is a bit more complicated than simply anti-woman as the starting point. there are plenty of people that genuinely believe the child belongs to G0d
[17:17:10] <cirdan> ThePendulum: then they should have no trouble with abortion, as the child goes back to him
[17:17:30] <ThePendulum> and yeah any meat eater shouldn't get started about life, lol
[17:17:36] <G0d> well they'll get a shock when I demand it is raised as a virgin to be sacrificed on their 12th birthday
[17:17:40] <cirdan> and once he starts cutting checks to support his kids, we can talk again
[17:18:08] <dTal> ThePendulum: you *can* agree with anti abortion, or you *do*?
[17:18:27] <cirdan> i'm not a fan of it, but it's not my body that has to get destroyed and possibly killed over it
[17:18:41] <ThePendulum> dTal: I mean to use the term vs pro-life or anti-woman, not the concept
[17:18:58] <dTal> pro-life is inherently anti-woman because it takes away her choice
[17:19:15] <cirdan> the irony was choking when anti-maskers were using signs "my body my choice"
[17:19:17] <dTal> it's not like getting an abortion is *fun*
[17:19:33] <dTal> if someone is getting an abortion, there's probably a good reason
[17:19:37] <cirdan> and it's a terrible decision for many women
[17:19:46] <dTal> getting the government all involved isn't gonna help
[17:19:52] <ThePendulum> dTal: yes, but that implies that that is ubiquitously the motivation for almost all "pro lifers"
[17:19:52] <cirdan> it's not like picking which club to go to on friday night
[17:20:44] <joepie91> ThePendulum: ... realistically, yes, it is
[17:20:47] <ThePendulum> think they were looking to have a go at those pesky libtard dems more than trying to make a point
[17:20:54] <joepie91> the "scratch a _____, find a ______" meme applies here
[17:22:22] <cirdan> ThePendulum: it really is insane that many people on the right are only there to "own the libs" even when it activly hurts themselves
[17:22:35] <cirdan> like it's a mental illness level of crazy
[17:23:05] <cirdan> on welfare? screams to take it away/restrict it (to all but themselves)
[17:23:10] <joepie91> ThePendulum: think of it like the zwarte piet thing here. there are plenty of people who don't have much of an issue with it, who don't have racist associations or intentions with it. but of the people who *actively campaign for keeping it*, basically 100% are racist assholes
[17:23:32] <joepie91> there's something very similar going on with anti-abortion campaigns
[17:24:08] <joepie91> abortion is a complicated subject and people can have nuanced opinions about it, but if you look at specifically the people who actively campaign against it, you'll find that misogyny is basically a universal trait among them
[17:24:29] <joepie91> so in that sense, I think "anti-woman" can be a reasonable branding for that movement
[17:26:33] <cirdan> since there's so many religious calls about it, it's close to making it illegal to *not* be part of a certain religion if you agree with it or not.
[17:27:52] <ThePendulum> if you are running a counter-campaign, though, don't you also need to appeal to the quiet majority? in this case it's about that t-shirt that said "don't let men make legislation about women's issues", which is broadcast to the world, not just the activists of the opposite side, and one figure from a survey shows there is only a marginal imbalance between genders on the issue
[17:28:36] <cirdan> oh yeah some women are super anti-abortion. great for them, they can chose to never get one!
[17:28:49] <joepie91> ThePendulum: you will never win a battle with fascists if you fight it on the assumption that it's a level playing field and you 'just need to make better points'
[17:29:03] <joepie91> that applies here too
[17:29:04] <ThePendulum> that is something these people don't seem to understand either. pro-choice is exactly what it is. you can choose to keep your baby for whatever delusional reason
[17:29:30] <cirdan> I want to see a law making infant genital multination a crime...
[17:29:47] <ThePendulum> joepie91: the activists might be in the 'fascist' camp, I don't think the quiet anti-abortion folks are necessarily
[17:29:50] <ThePendulum> I mean we're dealing with half a country here
[17:30:42] <ThePendulum> cirdan: reminded of Christopher Hitchens absolutely roasting some rabbi suggesting his baby cried less getting a haircut than getting a circumcision
[17:30:42] <cirdan> i bet many of the quiet ones are just doing what they are told
[17:31:10] *** Quits: Enyo (~Enyo@cpe-24-59-253-105.twcny.res.rr.com) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[17:31:12] <joepie91> ThePendulum: the quiet anti-abortion folks are not relevant here
[17:31:13] <cirdan> ThePendulum: yeah. it's illegal to do it to girls but encouraged for boys, wtf
[17:31:54] <joepie91> ThePendulum: anti-abortion activists are not actually campaigning against abortion, in the same way that TERFs are not campaigning for feminism and groups like the "LGB Alliance" are not campaigning for queer rights
[17:32:17] <joepie91> "anti-abortion" is just the vehicle, something about which there is currently no clear social consensus
[17:32:26] <joepie91> a way for them to move the overton window
[17:32:42] <dTal> the thing that people always miss is that "anti-abortion" isn't about whether you think abortion is a swell thing. Everyone agrees that it sucks. It's about whether you think criminalizing abortion will lead to a better, fairer, more just world
[17:32:52] <dTal> which of course it fucking won't
[17:32:54] <joepie91> it's the same reason why when you entertain someone who claims to be "supportive of gay rights" but who is being transphobic, they WILL end up being homophobic after a while as well
[17:33:11] <ThePendulum> joepie91: so what are the pro-choice folks campaigning for? to convince those select fascists, or the broader public that will see them on the news and on the streets on their way to work?
[17:33:18] <joepie91> their goal was always to shift the window, the narrative, to diverge into other things as well
[17:33:27] <joepie91> they are only 'supportive' of gay rights for as long as it is socially expected to do so
[17:33:34] <joepie91> once it no longer is, because eg. trans rights are being eroded, the mask comes off
[17:33:36] <cirdan> pro-choice = stfo and leave me a lone
[17:33:57] <joepie91> same shit with anti-abortion activists; it's just the first step in an ultimate goal of eliminating women's rights and autonomy, bodily or otherwise
[17:34:16] <joepie91> there's a reason these activists are almost always funded by the same heavily misogynist fundamentalist christian groups
[17:34:21] <dTal> it's it funny how the pro-lifers also always claim to be "small government", even while arguing the government should step in and fuck with people's private lives
[17:34:36] <dTal> what they really mean is they want government to be small when it's not them
[17:34:50] <dTal> they want a big tough government when it's on their side
[17:34:54] <dTal> there's no principle there
[17:35:05] <joepie91> ThePendulum: what pro-choice folks are campaigning for depends on how well they understand the game they are playing
[17:35:16] <ThePendulum> dTal: yeah, same stance with drugs, lol
[17:35:24] <joepie91> but "convincing fascists" is a pointless endeavour in any context
[17:35:41] <ThePendulum> people can sort themselves out, but lock them up for life if they're smoking reefer
[17:35:47] <joepie91> even "convincing the broader public [of your views]" usually isn't a productive goal
[17:36:01] <joepie91> because it legitimizes the other party's stance as being a valid opinion to hold
[17:36:06] <joepie91> it turns it into a debate
[17:36:11] <joepie91>  * it turns it into a 'debate'
[17:36:34] <joepie91> if you want to effectively fight fascism, you need to attack its credibility, its sentiments and manipulative tactics
[17:36:51] <joepie91> rip off the mask, eject them from your spaces
[17:37:06] <joepie91> make very clear that you do not recognize them as a legitimate participant in the public debate
[17:37:32] <joepie91> that is why it is so important to emphasize that "anti-abortion" activists are not actually debating the merits of abortion, but that it's just a vehicle for a broader misogynist ideology
[17:37:53] <joepie91> they're not trying to have a good-faith public debate, they're just pretending to
[17:38:02] <joepie91> and if you engage on that pretense, you lose
[17:38:25] <dTal> Don't argue the principle because they don't have any. Argue the policy
[17:38:32] <ThePendulum> basically what I'm trying to figure out is whether it makes sense to have a shirt saying "don't let men legislate women's issues" when the misogynists are unmovable fascists and the quiet majority has a pretty balanced gender distribution
[17:38:42] <ThePendulum> it just seemed like a bit of a shallow hot take
[17:39:04] <joepie91> ThePendulum: again, this isn't about the 'quiet majority', they are not a party to the whole thing
[17:39:10] <joepie91> their demographic makeup is not releavnt
[17:39:11] <joepie91> relevant*
[17:39:26] <joepie91> like, literally, it doesn't matter
[17:39:44] <joepie91> I think that that specific text is not really explicit enough, personally, but the underlying sentiment is absolutely a valid one
[17:39:57] <joepie91> because it highlights that this is not about abortion, this is about whether women should have autonomy or not
[17:40:22] <unfinity> ・゜゜・ ​ 。。・゜゜\_o​< QUACK​!
