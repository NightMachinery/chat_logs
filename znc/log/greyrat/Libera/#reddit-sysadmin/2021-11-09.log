[00:49:23] <Activ8> when I get paid next week I’m debating weather to add another 8gb to my server and use esxi for the host and run multiple Linux guests 
[00:49:36] <Activ8> atm I have a single linux box with docker
[00:49:47] <Hunterkll> i'd put hyper-v on there to get more bang for the buck resource wise 
[00:49:59] <Hunterkll> at least when it comes to storage/IO perf and vCPU density
[00:50:12] <Activ8> Is hyper-v nativ like esxi/proxmox
[00:50:25] <Hunterkll> you mean a bare metal tier-1 hypervisor? yes
[00:50:25] <Activ8> i don’t want to be adding windows as the host OS 
[00:50:34] <Hunterkll> no, it's just like Xen in the operational model
[00:50:41] <Hunterkll> the "windows" is just a highly priv'd VM 
[00:50:44] <Activ8> move not used a hyper visor b4
[00:50:54] <Hunterkll> like xen's dom0 or ESXi's control OS
[00:51:02] <Activ8> i kinda want to keep away from windows as a primary OS
[00:51:11] <Hunterkll> the Aurora hypervisor under the hood is pure bare metal
[00:51:13] <Activ8> i like the small footprint is with linux
[00:51:22] <Hunterkll> in fact, i'd wager that most new consumer laptops are running windows as a VM these days 
[00:51:23] <Activ8> i was thinking about core
[00:51:28] <Hunterkll> with virtualization based security automatically lighting on
[00:51:39] <Hunterkll> which means a lmost all new consumer machines are running hyper-v and they don't even realize it
[00:51:47] <Activ8> really?
[00:51:59] <Hunterkll> yea, for the VBS stuff, they use hyper-v hypervisor to power it all
[00:51:59] <Activ8> I don’t think I’ve come across that as of yet
[00:52:29] <Activ8> I may stick 2022 server core on it
[00:52:32] <Hunterkll> any base kit from the store today will have VBS on by default 
[00:52:36] <Activ8> and run hyper visor
[00:53:05] <Hunterkll> right, 2022 if it doesn't automatically light up VBS would be bare metal, but once you turn on hyper-v (or if VBS activates) then that "bare metal" os is just another VM 
[00:53:12] <Hunterkll> just with a lot more access
[00:53:28] <Hunterkll> Activ8: you should install WAC (windows admin center) after you do that - then you'll have a nice handy web interface to manage stuff

[00:54:08] <Hunterkll> no
[00:54:17] <Activ8> ive played about with WAC before I love it to manage core

[00:57:18] <Hunterkll> hell 32gb would be enough 
[00:57:29] <Activ8> well the storage would be for VMs only and it only takes 16GB ram max but has a quad core in
[00:57:54] <Hunterkll> and hypervisor/management stack/etc providing you near-vSphere level features uses less than a gig of ram in core config 
[00:57:59] <Activ8> should be enough for 5-6 VMs

[01:42:44] <haise01_> Hunterkll: fair enough

[01:44:35] <Hunterkll> i'd quit if we put ubuntu anywhere
[01:44:36] <Hunterkll> lol
[01:44:37] <Activ8> I’ve never actually come across a full Linux network yet
[01:44:46] <Hunterkll> we have several

[01:45:35] <Hunterkll> our red hat and oracle bills are yuuuuge
[01:45:38] <Hunterkll> and oracle's cheaper than redhat

[01:46:29] <Hunterkll> basically, on Hyper-V 2016, RHEL 7 would kernel panic randomly

[01:47:29] <layer8> teh_f4ll3n meant: "now that's systemtap"

[01:48:00] <Hunterkll> teh_f4ll3n: $499 per incident for microsoft
[01:48:06] <Hunterkll> with red hat you have to maintain annual contracts

[01:48:37] <teh_f4ll3n> boss won't pay that much
[01:48:37] <Hunterkll> catbeard: nah free account with no license can view all that shit 
[01:48:48] <Hunterkll> Activ8: yea, we pay $2500/host for red hat licensing 
[01:48:49] <Hunterkll> lol
[01:48:57] <Hunterkll> that is of course unlimited supported VMs however
[01:49:06] <Hunterkll> per host
[01:49:14] <Hunterkll> obviously we don't pay the windows sticker price of $8k/host lol
[01:49:21] <Activ8> Ouch
[01:49:23] <Hunterkll> having a proper EA and superb pricing level
[01:49:38] <Hunterkll> Activ8: yea, but with that $8k/host if you go the hyper-v route you're ditching $3-5k in VMware licensing costs 
[01:49:43] <catbeard> sounds like you're getting bent over either way
[01:49:44] <Activ8> microsoft licensing can be confusing though at times
[01:49:46] <Hunterkll> and that's a one time straight up sticker price 
[01:49:54] <Hunterkll> no annual reocurring shit unless you renew SA 
[01:50:08] <Hunterkll> so you get rid of annual renewal fees for everything
[01:50:12] <Activ8> I think it’s getting more expensive for things these days 
[01:50:30] <Activ8> even a small network can be costly
[01:50:31] <Hunterkll> MS licensing is ridiculously easy if you start from "What do you need?" then it's just filling in checkboxes 
[01:50:36] <catbeard> you wanted minimum wage to increase, well there ya go
[01:51:09] <Hunterkll> Activ8: i mean, if you think about it, nothing's really changed except you can achive more with less, so in reality, if they were paying what they should have done instead of casual rampant piracy the industry has, well, costs would be lower these days for most operations
[01:51:11] <Activ8> Its a piss take stop increasing pricing of things then you wouldn’t need to increase wages 😂
[01:51:27] <catbeard> they need to make more money to pay people more
[01:51:33] <teh_f4ll3n> 54%...
[01:51:37] <catbeard> or it cuts into their profit margins
[01:51:41] <catbeard> and we certainly don't want that
[01:51:45] <Activ8> You think it’s piracy causing the hike in software prices?
[01:51:56] <teh_f4ll3n> ~30minutes and I'm done with this shit for now
[01:51:57] <Activ8> or is it just software companies in general been greedy
[01:52:00] <Hunterkll> Activ8: no, i'm saying, if everyone was actually paying for what they used, they'd be paying far less now :P
[01:52:17] <catbeard> Activ8: they can get away with it because you don't have a tangible product
[01:52:18] <Hunterkll> like say, compared to 15 years ago when you used the same win2k disk for every machine at some mom and pop 
[01:52:19] <Hunterkll> lol
[01:52:40] <Hunterkll> I mean, windows server datacenter license pricing hasn't really materially changed e xcept a small recent increase in like, 15 years
[01:52:41] <Hunterkll> so
[01:52:46] <Activ8> Lol yeh I had about 5 copies of win 2k
[01:52:48] <catbeard> it's not really stealing, they still have it, you just have a copy
[01:52:57] <teh_f4ll3n> can confirm, I had to get the MD have the accounts go through the charges and give him a list of all the shit we're paying form
[01:53:04] <Activ8> i got all my software from a place I worked didn’t have to buy it
[01:53:15] <teh_f4ll3n> 30% of services we haven't touched in months
[01:53:32] <teh_f4ll3n> for

[01:54:14] <Hunterkll> i find it frightening how much of my home software is legitimately licensed
[01:54:20] <Hunterkll> half of it by accident
[01:54:44] <catbeard> some because the "key" is md5($email)
[01:54:51] <Activ8> Well we charge customers for 0365 but they never tell us when staff leave so their mailboxes might be open but not used for months we earn money by companies not telling us stuff
[01:54:59] <Hunterkll>  lol
[01:55:03] <teh_f4ll3n> yup
[01:55:06] <Activ8> every 2-4 months we send a reminder
[01:55:07] <xe0n> thats your fault for not doing audits
[01:55:10] <xe0n> but ayyy msp life yoo
[01:55:11] <Hunterkll> Activ8: yea but that's because of the markup you're charging to be the front line support for them 
[01:55:16] <Hunterkll> xe0n: no that's *their* fault
[01:55:17] <catbeard> Hunterkll: yeah you jelly bean

[04:37:57] <Hunterkll> why thhe fuck is your customer support shit not gated behind VPN
[04:38:00] <Hunterkll> is my immediate thought
[04:38:19] <JollyRgrs> lol
[04:38:22] <JollyRgrs> that's bad
[04:38:26] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Being honest, how often do you actually see proper segmentation?
[04:38:34] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> For me almost never
[04:38:48] <Hunterkll> or even just like ours,m where you have to MFA properly and get bounced through our F5's and shit to a SaaS app available externally

[04:39:00] <Hunterkll> lol
[04:39:09] <JollyRgrs> but i mean... segmenting.... stuff that never has to be customer facing.... should never be public facing
[04:39:21] <JollyRgrs> until you get into all that cloud services crap
[04:39:28] <Hunterkll> even then

[04:39:57] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Right
[04:40:15] <Hunterkll> ya i'm just saying that 
[04:40:29] <Hunterkll> an MFA vpn gate to get access to the SaaS apps even if they're externally hosted by IP range lockdown

[04:40:51] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Maybe
[04:41:13] <JollyRgrs> like, we can log into o365 w/o being on VPN... that would be hard to fight to put behind a VPN
[04:41:27] <Hunterkll> oh we can too
[04:41:32] <Hunterkll> you can even download email attachments
[04:41:32] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> Depends though, you compromise an endpoint with active session protected by MFA, the MFA become moot
[04:41:33] <Hunterkll> but .....
[04:41:55] <Hunterkll> can't download files from sharepoint or print (only view) and can't set up onedrive on a machine unless other conditions are met

[04:42:02] <JollyRgrs> oh, yeah
[04:42:04] <JollyRgrs> sure
[04:42:09] <JollyRgrs> that makes more sense

[04:47:11] <Hunterkll> lol
[04:48:11] <JollyRgrs> what specs are you looking for?
[04:48:26] <JollyRgrs> best half-height i could get about 2 yrs ago was a 1050 ti
[04:48:29] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: anything that'll work properly with server OSes and DDA
[04:48:37] <Hunterkll> without fuckery
[04:48:44] <JollyRgrs> yeah... so i dunno that off the top of my head
[04:48:48] <JollyRgrs> that's why i asked you
[04:49:09] <JollyRgrs> i have exp. with half-height GPUs since i ganked a bunch of SFF from my prev job before i left
[04:49:09] <CableNinja> nvidia still makes super low end cards that are normal PCI card size
[04:49:32] <JollyRgrs> again, 1050ti is 4gb ram and comes in half-height options
[04:49:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[04:49:39] <Hunterkll> yea, problem is driver fuckyness
[04:49:43] <Hunterkll> CableNinja: yea i need half height 
[04:49:51] <Hunterkll> 2U server, no risers (no space to cable one in either)
[04:49:51] * CableNinja hands Hunterkll a hack saw
[04:49:52] <JollyRgrs> i mean, mostly you have 2 drivers...
[04:49:54] <JollyRgrs> AMD or nvidia
[04:50:06] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: no no, like, in virtualization, that 1050 ti with the driver will code 43 all day long
[04:50:07] <Hunterkll> lol
[04:50:13] <Hunterkll> and refuse to work
[04:50:18] <Hunterkll> until you convince the driver it's not in a VM
[04:50:30] <JollyRgrs> so what do you need? a quadro?
[04:50:31] <Hunterkll> or maybe it's code 10? or both.... either way 
[04:50:38] <Hunterkll> probably
[04:50:49] <CableNinja> throws codes like a geriatric on their death bed
[04:51:01] <JollyRgrs> you doing pci passthrough to the guest?

[12:23:37] <lancehead> Wait was that meant for me or the website 
[12:23:44] <csws> just in general complaining
[12:23:48] <lancehead> Ah fair enough 
[12:23:51] <lancehead> So anyway 
[12:23:56] <csws> so anyway
[12:24:47] <lancehead> We had a custom Windows 10 image that previously failed, so it was emptied out and I'm currently remaking it to see where it went wrong (kept bluescreening) 
[12:25:02] <lancehead> And whenever I try to rename one of my ethernet adapters, it says that adapter already exists 
[12:25:46] <lancehead> Meaning the previous image had an adapter named that, but since this PC has a new NIC now, I can't get rid of the actual adapter anymore. I got rid of every registry entry for it and I still can't rename :(
[12:27:57] <SirSceptalot> you've already had a peak in device manager under "show hidden devices"?
[12:28:10] <lancehead> Yep. Nothing there that's unused 
[12:28:26] <lancehead> Since there's no device/drivers left from the previous NIC

[12:28:48] <SirSceptalot> dunno if that command actually does anything

[12:58:44] <lancehead> Just that one 
[12:59:17] <lancehead> Main problem isn't the name, by the way. These interfaces also need certain static IPs to work on the location they're being shipped to

[13:10:25] <Hunterkll> lancehead: right, but answering some ofthe questions can give insight into the issue better given how questions can be phrased (such as oh - you're not using an unmodified base WIM?) to give a target for better questions.....
[13:11:42] <Hunterkll> like say, with more details, maybe a DISM slap of a patch is enough, for example
[13:12:35] <lancehead> Yeah. What's everyone up to at work today? 
[13:13:02] <Hunterkll> .... hilariously, i'll be working on machine images today 
[13:13:03] <SirSceptalot> nonono, I want to know what's up with this NIC business now
[13:13:54] <lancehead> lol fair enough @ SirSceptalot 
[13:14:31] <Hunterkll> actually, that does beg the question - is renaming the nic mandatory? 
[13:15:15] <Hunterkll> because I actually have an idea about that..... you still have the image before you made any edits, right?
[13:15:29] <lancehead> The renaming isn't really the issue. They need static IPs to work on location 
[13:15:58] <lancehead> I do, yes 
[13:16:15] <Hunterkll> Hummm, and you say it was stripped down - how was that done?
[13:17:52] <lancehead> I'm not too sure, it was done by a previous intern (that's where the pain started) 
[13:18:16] <Hunterkll> well, how stripped down is stripped down?
[13:18:39] <lancehead> Pretty much entirely except for base company software and, in this case, those adapters

[13:19:55] <Hunterkll> midnight to others!
[13:19:56] <lancehead> Hiya Activ8 
[13:20:02] <sd> 09<H​aise> Activ8: morning
[13:20:02] <Activ8> morning lancehead
[13:20:07] <sd> 05<V​ALOS> yo activ
[13:20:11] <SirSceptalot> g'day
[13:20:17] <Activ8> it's midnight where you are Hunterkll?
[13:20:19] <Hunterkll> lancehead: ah, close enough, hyper-v would be better though in this case (more passthrough emulated stuff that isn't actual devices to work through)
[13:20:23] <Hunterkll> Activ8: no, but it is somewhere
[13:20:28] <sd> 09<H​aise> lol
[13:20:32] <Activ8> I need to make some phone calls, printer issues on couple tickets.
[13:20:38] <Activ8> dodgy basteds using wifi lol
[13:20:41] <lancehead> Yee, VMWare is all I have unfortunately 
[13:20:59] <sd> 09<H​aise> You can't flip switch for Hyper-V ?
[13:21:37] <Hunterkll> not an issue
[13:21:52] <lancehead> Never really used Hyper-V, could switch over to it but I don't think it'll matter much in this situation 
[13:22:54] <Hunterkll> yea no worries
[13:23:04] <sd> 11<H​otmess> hyper-v is petty easy
[13:23:07] <Hunterkll> i'm just thinking of best approaches here
[13:23:31] <sd> 09<H​aise> Just use what you have on hand and what you know how to use
[13:23:47] <Activ8> I love hyper-v
[13:23:49] <Hunterkll> @Hotmess my idea for hyper-v was a "cleanest" deploy hardware profile to diagnose a thick image with issues 
[13:23:50] <Hunterkll> but
[13:23:51] <Activ8> it's pretty straight forward
[13:24:00] <Hunterkll> VMware will work just fine for this if we go that route
[13:24:02] <sd> 11<H​otmess> oh right
[13:24:46] <Hunterkll> I prefer Hyper-V for windows b/c of all the built in paravirt so you're not dealing with as much emulated hardware, but like I said, here it doesn't really matter
[13:25:18] <lancehead> That does sound kinda nice... might switch over after all 
[13:26:42] <Hunterkll> well
[13:26:53] <Hunterkll> recent versions of VMware workstation can work with hyper-v enabled at the same time 
[13:27:02] <Hunterkll> if you ena ble the "Windows Hypervisor Platform" feature
[13:27:18] <lancehead> oooo 
[13:27:32] <lancehead> I was not aware of that, thanks 
[13:28:23] <Hunterkll> ANYWAY
[13:28:26] <sd> 13<C​olour> Oooohhh coool to know
[13:28:38] <Hunterkll> @Colour yea this is like 2 years old news 
[13:28:41] <Hunterkll> Virtualbox is the same
[13:28:41] <Hunterkll> :P
[13:29:04] <sd> 13<C​olour> Huhhhh
[13:29:22] <sd> 13<C​olour> Had no idea
[13:29:59] <Hunterkll> Yup Virtualbox had a shipping solution before VMware did iirc
[13:30:00] <Hunterkll> in 2019
[13:35:26] <Hunterkll> lancehead: anyway, well, if you can't rebase the image, i'd install it in a VM without NICs, check dev manager for phantom nics, delete those if present, sysprep it again, and recapture it and see if THAT helps 
[13:36:06] <DrZak> bloody hell
[13:36:10] <lancehead> I'll suggest that when my supervisor comes in today if he doesn't have any other ideas. Ty 
[13:36:18] <Activ8> isn't it fab when tickets resolve themselves, easy closures
[13:36:30] <lancehead> Magic ticket? 
[13:36:34] <sd> 05<V​ALOS> Oh that's the best
[13:36:51] <lancehead> We need a name for this 
[13:36:55] <Hunterkll> lancehead: my immediate idea would be to just lay down a WIM that's stock, boot in audit mode, install the wallpaper, AVG, and company apps, then seal, sysprep, and use that - inside a VM without a NIC 
[13:37:02] <Activ8> yeh magic tickets
[13:37:03] <Hunterkll> if it's something you can do 
[13:37:06] <lancehead> Angel ticket
[13:37:09] <Hunterkll> like, maybe a side project
[13:37:11] <DrZak> i am starting to get a feeling some imbecile manager told my south asian colleagues to say 'we are not getting enough support and there's not much community help and cultural understanding' every time they are dumb as shit
[13:37:20] <Activ8> user said "thanks for resolving the issue the printer is working again"
[13:37:27] <Activ8> I didn't do anything but didn't tell the user this
[13:37:37] <Hunterkll> lancehead: since you're stuck with thick images, i'd try and remove as many variables as possible while still delivering the same thing 
[13:37:49] <lancehead> Hunterkll, I'll suggest both of these ^^ 
[13:38:10] <lancehead> Thanks 
[13:38:22] <Hunterkll> lancehead: going forward, obviously, the 'correct' answer is an MDT task sequence with an unmodified base WIM and proper task sequence steps

[13:38:45] <Hunterkll> but twiddling the image inside a VM without any NICs at all and cleaning it up then sealing it 
[13:38:48] <sd> 05<V​ALOS> @Activ8 just accept that you are the computer god to most users in your company
[13:38:52] <Hunterkll> is probably your fastest 'immediate resolution' route
[13:39:02] <lancehead> And apologies for going off on you before; it's been happening a lot where I'm following orders and people tell me it's wrong. Irks me when I'm doing something that's wrong and can't do much about it, insecurity thing I guess 
[13:39:02] <sd> 05<V​ALOS> If something gets fixed related to computers it *must* be your doing
[13:39:23] <Activ8> I'm sick of people putting printers on wifi
[13:39:25] <Activ8> it's pissing me off
[13:39:26] <Activ8> lol
[13:39:31] <Hunterkll> lancehead: yea, but it also helps when people tell you outright "how you're doing it is wrong" 
[13:39:40] <Hunterkll> lancehead: then you can fire back "I only have X Y Z  options"
[13:39:49] <Hunterkll> then we can meet in the middle, with a plan to move forward to how to not do it wrong
[13:39:52] <lancehead> I'll definitely try that first for now and try and... gently... tell my supervisor this wasn't a great way to do this lol 
[13:39:56] <lancehead> True that ^^ 
[13:40:03] <Activ8> they should never have put software for printers on wifi! noobs
[13:40:10] <Hunterkll> I do come off rough, but it's not in a mean way 
[13:40:15] <lancehead> Printers are dark magic  
[13:40:22] <lancehead> I'm the same, I get a little too down to earth sometimes 
[13:40:27] <Hunterkll> it's just " come on you dumb fucks, this is the wrong way since like, 2003" 
[13:40:28] <SirSceptalot> THAT'S WACIST!
[13:40:29] <DrZak> printers are god shit

[13:41:23] <lancehead> In other news; either my TMJ is giving me ear pain or I'm getting an inner ear infection :( 
[13:41:35] <DrZak> no, i seriously mean they are so horrific, god must've shit into the brains of printer drivers coders
[13:41:36] <Activ8> companies need to stop putting them on wifi
[13:41:39] <Activ8> I keep telling em
[13:41:41] <DrZak> they have brain full of shit from god
[13:41:49] <lancehead> lmaooo DrZak 
[13:41:50] <Hunterkll> If you have a decent printer......
[13:41:59] * Hunterkll shrugs
[13:42:08] <Hunterkll> Turns out if you spend $50 on a printer
[13:42:08] <DrZak> it got trully pronounced the moment of GDI printers
[13:42:11] <Hunterkll> you get a $50 printer
[13:42:29] <DrZak> without circuits inside it relying completely on the computer
[13:42:33] <Hunterkll> now, that being said, my personal printer was $20 
[13:42:38] <Activ8> they not $50 printers lol
[13:42:53] <Activ8> they $200
[13:42:54] <Hunterkll> but it for goddamn sure wasn't a $20 printer when it was made in 1993 xD
[13:42:58] <lancehead> I win in this situation 
[13:43:02] <lancehead> I have no printer 
[13:43:04] <lancehead> Boom
[13:43:04] <Hunterkll> Activ8: might as well still be a $50 printer
[13:43:09] <Activ8> I remember when the first epson photo inkjet come out
[13:43:20] <Hunterkll> lancehead: i've done maintence and change toner cartridge once on my printer.... in like 10-15 years
[13:43:25] <Activ8> I printed a leopard photo out on it and it used the whole ink cartridge lol
[13:43:38] <Activ8> took 1 hour to print 1 sheet of a4
[13:43:47] <lancehead> I only print something twice a year so I just go to a copy shop and pay $0.80 
[13:43:53] <Activ8> I print nothing out
[13:43:58] <Activ8> paperless ftw
[13:44:10] <Hunterkll> ah
[13:44:15] <Hunterkll> shipping labels and shit
[13:44:18] <lancehead> It's mostly the odd amazon return label for me >_> 
[13:44:20] <Hunterkll> also occasionally manuals 
[13:44:23] <lancehead> Yeah exactly 
[13:44:33] <Hunterkll> so i might go like 5 months doing 3 pages a month
[13:44:36] <Hunterkll> then do 500 pages in one job
[13:44:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[13:44:47] <lancehead> I either print shipping labels or school related stuff 
[13:44:53] <lancehead> Never anything else 
[13:44:55] <Activ8> I take that back, shipping labels yes I print
[13:45:07] <lancehead> Psh, that's not paperles! 
[13:45:10] <Hunterkll> yea i buy packs of 100 peel off print labels 
[13:45:10] <lancehead> paperless* 
[13:45:11] <Hunterkll> its nice
[13:45:21] <Hunterkll> i should get a thermal printer for doing roll printing eventually for that though
[13:45:25] <lancehead> If you were really paperless, you'd just tape a tablet with a PDF to the box!
[13:45:30] <Hunterkll> My printer sadly needs a new sensor
[13:45:33] <Activ8> lol
[13:45:37] <Hunterkll> it jams after 40+ consecutive pages
[13:45:47] <Hunterkll> doesn't actually jam, just sensor detects a jam
[13:45:47] <Activ8> does it listen to bob marley
[13:45:52] <Hunterkll> its a $5 sensor so 
[13:45:55] <Hunterkll> i'm just being lazy
[13:46:18] <Activ8> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFRbZJXjWIA
[13:46:19] <lancehead> Activ8, there's two types of people in this world. When you hear "jam", you think of Bob Marley, when I hear "jam" I think of a firearm 
[13:46:26] <Activ8> LOL
[13:46:40] <Hunterkll> the literal only maintenance that's been done on my printer is the roller kit, and changing the toner cartridge
[13:46:42] <Hunterkll> *since 1993*
[13:46:45] <Hunterkll> now that's quality
[13:46:48] <Activ8> that's 100% a printer song
[13:46:51] <Hunterkll> my printer's almost 30 fucking years old
[13:47:08] <lancehead> Hunterkll, your printer would not pass military trials with that round count 
[13:47:10] <lancehead> Uh page count
[13:47:25] <Hunterkll> lancehead: no, but it'd make a hell of a bench rest for my EBR
[13:47:30] <Joe-Developer> anyone else dealing with the PrintNightmare?
[13:47:33] <lancehead> Ayy 
[13:47:46] <Hunterkll> lancehead: and probably break the rifle if i shot too fast
[13:48:04] <lancehead> What, waking up screaming at night because you dreamt of having to print something over wifi? @ Joe-Developer 
[13:48:08] <DrZak> ok, i think i found a winner of idiot application of the year
[13:48:12] <DrZak> it is an MS Access 'database' connected via VBA add-on into Outlook and then sending the data to a java application, that stores it in a NOsql db

[13:48:20] <Hunterkll> Joe-Developer: no i think we all resolved that when the patches came out months ago :P

[13:49:55] <Hunterkll> Hah
[13:49:59] <lancehead> I'm Dutch and obsessed with firearms, it's not a good combo 
[13:50:10] <Hunterkll> move to Czech
[13:50:13] <lancehead> Best I can do here is .22lr for a few years and then 45ACP 
[13:50:15] <Hunterkll> closest you'll get
[13:50:18] <lancehead> True that 
[13:51:02] <Hunterkll> lancehead: but no, I actually procured a weapon many years ago that's my pride and joy and my pocket ace in the hole if i ever need a house down payment
[13:51:17] <lancehead> Tbh I'd only want a firearm for target shooting anyway, so a .22lr and a range works fine for me :p 
[13:51:19] <lancehead> Ooo nice 
[13:51:32] <Hunterkll> H&K MP5K ;) 
[13:51:39] <Hunterkll> Pre-ban, fully transferrable 
[13:51:49] <lancehead> Damn, thought you were going to say surplus M249B 
[13:51:51] <Hunterkll> paid like .... $13k? or so for it? it's worth about $45k now 
[13:52:10] <Hunterkll> lancehead: there is only *one* registered legally transferrable SAW and it's serial number.... 1 or 3 i think
[13:52:13] <SirSceptalot> I had no idea guns went for that much money
[13:52:26] <Hunterkll> SirSceptalot: a pre-ban transferrable MP5?
[13:52:39] <lancehead> SirSceptalot, you'd be surprised. The M249B I just mentioned is worth about 170K 
[13:52:41] <Hunterkll> oh, you have no idea what the machine gun market is like
[13:52:50] <SirSceptalot> can confirm, am surprised
[13:52:53] <Hunterkll> lancehead: there's only one legally transferrable SAW in the U S 
[13:53:00] <lancehead> Yeah, it's a 249 no? 
[13:53:03] <Hunterkll> and it's someone who was there during development 
[13:53:13] <Hunterkll> and took one home that was meant to be scrapped and registered it
[13:53:19] <Hunterkll> the other two were destroyed
[13:53:22] <lancehead> Lmaoo nice 
[13:53:31] <Hunterkll> so there's literally only *one* legal M249 in the US
[13:53:31] <lancehead> ultimate yoink
[13:53:35] <Activ8> I just had another printer ticket come through
[13:53:39] <Hunterkll> there are a bunch of SCAM ones though
[13:53:40] <Activ8> I think it's printer week
[13:53:41] <Hunterkll> be wary 
[13:53:52] <Hunterkll> they're serial numbers transferred on receivers from other models
[13:53:56] <Hunterkll> and re built
[13:54:00] <Hunterkll> which is TOTALLY illegal
[13:54:19] <lancehead> Hmm one sec, I have to go to the toilet and find some gun-related stuff at work. Brb

[17:53:33] <JollyRgrs> @FeralTerminator what did you do prior to being a mechanic? As someone in a Sysadmin channel, I am curious
[17:53:35] <rpifan> because if anything the filler would add some micrograms to your face

[19:45:13] <JollyRgrs> i thought chem. was fun, just dind't like when they wanted me to memorize stuff
[19:45:18] <Hunterkll> it almost makes me want to go back to school for math if this is what the kids in fucking CROATIA are learning 
[19:45:22] <mistiry> i had so many science credits when i graduated lol
[19:45:34] <mistiry> i was in ROTC too, and had science credits from that as well. and math
[19:45:45] <teh_f4ll3n> like molar mass of elements to calculate how much stuff to add...
[19:45:49] <mistiry> i had so many credits my senior year wasnt much of anything

[19:46:39] <JollyRgrs> if i use it enough, i'll eventually "just know it"... but testing on the memorization of such is just "ass of nines"

[19:51:07] <mistiry> me
[19:51:16] <Hunterkll> yep
[19:51:19] <Hunterkll> it aint hard
[19:51:26] <JollyRgrs> teh_f4ll3n: that's fine... it is good to be able to do some maths in the head
[19:52:04] <JollyRgrs> you don't need a calculator before algebra unless you just suck... or unless teachers gave you like 50 problems of 3 digit by 3 digit  division and such
[19:52:07] <JollyRgrs> i hated long division
[19:52:14] <mistiry> i calculate the change every time i tip. because i always leave an amount that makes the final total an even dollar amount.
[19:52:15] <JollyRgrs> "show your work" "no"
[19:52:29] <Activ8> is it me or is google going through some rounded corner changes
[19:52:30] <int0x1C8> the set of pairs {p, 100-p} for p={0..100} forms a symmetry group
[19:52:32] <Activ8> I'm on windows 10 btw
[19:52:39] <Hunterkll> JollyRgrs: i pissed off my teachers by using a slide rule cuz i'm a dick
[19:52:39] <Hunterkll> lol
[19:52:44] <Activ8> everything that comes up now has rounded corners
[19:52:55] <JollyRgrs> mistiry: i used to... but when i started using a card for everything, i'd rather round the tip up to a solid .00 amount
[19:52:59] <rpifan> triangular corners are better
[19:53:16] <int0x1C8> its easiest to just memorize the pairs
[19:53:16] <Hunterkll> int0x1C8: $23.32 .... so change is .... +$0.08 = $0.40 .... so +6 .... 68 cents....
[19:53:17] <teh_f4ll3n> well, it got to a point I had marks deducted because I wasn't writing down the entire solutions anyway. I would start, then do a bunch in my head, and only write down if it was becoming too much to remember
[19:53:18] <Hunterkll> like
[19:53:20] <Hunterkll> not that hard
[19:53:45] <int0x1C8> 32 -> 68
[19:53:46] <sd> 08<b​denlinger> Trying to calculate cents in a tip while drunk is hard...

[19:56:28] <Hunterkll> int0x1C8: for me it's easier to add it up to a round number, then add it up to a whole dollar amount 
[19:56:52] <int0x1C8> .32 so 2+8=10, 3+6=9, so .68
[19:56:54] <Hunterkll> at least the way i think about handling cash 
[19:57:01] <mistiry> my favorite math thing was the trick i came up with all on my own for multiplying by 11. a lot to type out though. add the two digits together, if < 10 put the answer in the middle, if > 10 add one to first digit then the remaining numbers at the end. e.g. "23 x 11 = 253" (2+3=5, 2 5 3) or "75 x 11 = 825" (7+5=12 7+1=8, 8 2 5). that likely makes ZERO sense when typed out in an IRC chat.
[19:57:10] <Hunterkll> well, i'd just +8 to 40 then +60 to 100
[19:57:12] <csws> bdenlinger, guessing their prices are a little higher though? kinda socialised the issue I guess.
