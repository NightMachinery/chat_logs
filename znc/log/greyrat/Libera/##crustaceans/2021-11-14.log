[02:09:33] <dminkovsky> imode: what about it
[02:10:25] <imode> just that there's so many ways to have programs run in tandem and communicate with eachother, and none of them seem "correct".
[02:11:35] <dminkovsky> yeah it's crazy
[02:11:58] <dminkovsky> the more you learn about it, the weirded it gets, has been my observation
[02:13:48] <imode> there are two "kinds" of communication, one built around message passing between two points, and one built around a "vat" of messages that all programs can access and dig around in.
[02:13:55] <imode> message passing vs. shared memory.
[02:14:20] <ngoldbaum> yeah the people with the monkey avatars this week wtf
[02:14:22] <imode> both can be implemented in terms of one another.
[02:14:33] <imode> but neither is "correct".
[02:20:18] <dminkovsky> i would think shared memory was more fundamental than message passing

[18:15:27] <ngoldbaum> i took psychic damage reading this thread; also reading an email archive on sourceforge makes my eyes hurt https://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/feature-requests/58/
[18:15:29] <buttsbot> Docutils: Documentation Utilities / Feature Requests / #58 Migration Docutils from SourceForge to Github
[18:16:04] <ngoldbaum> (yes, the basis of the entire python documentation ecosystem is developed on svn on sourceforge and is still on a 0.x version after 20 years)
[18:25:24] <riv> I still can't believe people just stopped caring that sourceforge stuck adware into packages, because the owner cashed out
[18:30:37] <riv> https://lobste.rs/s/escaur/dangerously_user_friendly_web_server_for#c_96h737 another "Congratulations, you've ..." post
[18:30:37] <buttsbot> Dangerously user-friendly web server for quick prototyping and hackathons | Lobsters
[18:41:28] <edk> ngoldbaum: i think both of those things are relatively respectable tbh
[18:41:54] <edk> semver is dumb and anyone who opts out of it in any way deserves props for fighting the power
[18:43:14] <ngoldbaum> i didn’t mean to imply that docutils was doing anything wrong, however e.g. sphinx being at the mercy of docutils doing whatever while they depend on a “hostile” community they don’t work with is the insane bit
[18:43:41] <ngoldbaum> it evolved this was naturally over the decades but it’s a symptom of the creakyness of the python ecosystem atm
[18:43:46] <edk> oh, yeah, that is kinda fucked
[18:44:02] <ngoldbaum> see also: bolting types onto old packages with APIs that were designed before types
[18:45:09] <edk> what concerns me most about the python ecosystem is just how quickly projects break if you leave their CI running every month without using dependabot or something
[18:45:28] <edk> i suppose that's not unique to python but i just don't understand how anyone can be ok with this
[18:48:23] <riv> one of the worst UX things about python that happened, which is partly the fault of arch linux, is pip
[18:48:35] <riv> I thought, oh I should use pip to install libraries right? no, completely wrong
[18:48:41] <riv> you have to use virtualenv
[18:49:14] <edk> i think virtualenv is the problem here
[18:49:57] <ngoldbaum> part of it also, at least with numerical libraries, is that projects are getting more funding, attention, and development resources
[18:50:06] <ngoldbaum> and a lot of that is generating breaking changes
[18:50:18] <ngoldbaum> like numpy used to be quirky at the edges but stable
[18:50:30] <ngoldbaum> now they’re rewriting tons of stuff to fix the quirkyness
[18:50:38] <ngoldbaum> but lots of code depended on those behaviors
[18:51:07] <edk> yeah but you don't have to make breaking changes, it's just a question of whether you care about them
[18:51:20] <riv> edk: virtualenv is the solution
[18:51:27] <edk> i guess i feel like the programming world in general mostly only cares about new code
[18:51:33] <edk> if it was written more than 5 minutes ago it's irrelevant
[18:51:41] <ngoldbaum> in like 2012 you could write a script that used numpy and be pretty sure it would continue working as numpy got new releases forever
[18:51:45] <riv> the problem is that none of the information tells you to use it, nothing on the wiki - no warning if you try to use pip directly
[18:51:48] *** Joins: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge)
[18:51:49] <ngoldbaum> around like 2016 or so that changed
[18:52:31] <edk> riv: yeah i just disagree with that. i also think everyone does tell you to use it, but i think they're wrong and virtualenv just papers over the issues
[18:52:49] <riv> what issues?
[18:53:08] <edk> python projects being terrible at coexisting with each other
[18:53:32] <edk> like they're also not *that* terrible; i install stuff into my user packages all the time, and they hardly ever break each other
[18:54:12] <edk> but to the extent that they do, this problem should be solved by not using libraries that break compatibility
[18:56:31] <ngoldbaum> sadly https://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html applies here
[18:57:04] <riv> I see
[18:57:39] <gwozniak> Yes, very much CADT
[18:58:22] <riv> its not my choice what libraries something uses though
[19:00:18] <gwozniak> But it can be your choice to use the thing that uses libraries
[19:03:28] <riv> it takes way too long to do research on software to use
[19:03:42] <riv> like "I want a program that does X" is so hard to solve for me
[19:03:44] <ngoldbaum> choose language communities that value stability
[19:03:48] <ngoldbaum> like perl :p
[19:03:53] <riv> hehe
[19:04:33] <edk> yes, i don't blame you for not having time to make every program choice a strategic decision

[22:02:38] <imode> looks like my tuple space post blew up a bit.
[22:04:58] <riv> huh i saw a bit on that in lobsters, need to find the post
[22:05:12] <riv> found it
[22:05:59] <imode> been thinking about what a language that's primarily designed around a tuple space would look like.
[22:07:06] <hoistbypetard> imode: what do you mean by "a tuple space"? tuples are certainly first-class citizens in python
[22:08:02] <hoistbypetard> riv: i have only recently sucked it up and started using poetry. i'm happy with it so far.

[22:09:57] <hoistbypetard> indigo: wow that looks interesting
[22:10:15] <manicennui> imode: Isn't this need mostly served by key value stores?
[22:10:21] <imode> manicennui: not really, no.
[22:10:37] <riv> wo that looks good!
[22:11:03] *** imode is now known as inode
[22:11:06] <inode> aww.
[22:11:08] *** inode is now known as imode
[22:11:18] <manicennui> I guess I don't understand why I'd want tuples instead of pairs.
[22:11:51] <imode> it's more the idea of process coordination than anything a KV store is capable of.
[22:12:05] <imode> even redis is more akin to a tuple store by the way you can match on some key structure.
[22:13:24] <imode> unlike a KV store, reading or getting some tuple from the store removes the tuple so that no other process watching can read it, letting you do mutual exclusion.
[22:13:47] <manicennui> I see.
[22:13:57] <manicennui> But why are tuples in particular important?
[22:14:21] <imode> because you can enforce some structure to the space by the shape of the data you input.
[22:14:25] <manicennui> Other than perhaps partitioning/namespacing pairs a bit better.
[22:14:37] <imode> pairs aren't universal, you're probably used to redis.
[22:16:16] <manicennui> Setting aside the access pattern, S3 also basically provides a "tuple" with the bucket name, key, and value.
[22:16:34] <imode> they're also a little more strict on structure. if I hand the space a pattern like (compute, ?, ?, ?), this gives me back all requests to compute some operation on two operands.
[22:16:42] <riv> This is fascinating
[22:17:11] <imode> if I do (compute, ?, 1, ?), this gives me back all requests to compute some operation where the first operand is one.
[22:17:12] <manicennui> Giving me prolog vibes.
[22:17:19] <imode> yeah, only there's no variable binding.
[22:18:05] <manicennui> I'll admit that I'm not familiar with similar designs for achieving that access pattern. Got hung up on the tuple.
[22:18:14] <imode> heh, the tuple is the boring-ish part.
[22:18:17] <riv> its a bit like go channels, except you can match on the structure
[22:19:34] <imode> it's mostly the atomic operations on the space that matter, alongside the structural aspect of matching against tuples.
[22:21:16] <riv> you don't just have one tuple space right? you can make as many as you like?
[22:21:20] <imode> that's right.
[22:21:48] <imode> and you can trivially treat them as a single space by just having a single space, but prepending the space name to the head of the tuple.
[22:22:12] <imode> i.e "get me (?, ?, ?) from space X" really becomes "get me (X, ?, ?, ?) from the space".
[22:23:11] <riv> hah! nice
[22:23:30] <riv> this is such a cool idea
[22:24:54] <imode> https://www.toptal.com/developers/hastebin/raw/inarusanem
[22:24:54] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[22:25:26] <imode> I've tried building a language out of the tuple space concept multiple times.
[22:25:34] <imode> this example shows a text adventure.
[22:25:57] <imode> each "rule" is an agent that watches the space. I added variable binding.
[22:26:24] <riv> the things you put in a tuple need to be immutable
[22:26:44] <imode> things affixed with a `?` at the end aren't removed when read, things with a `;` at the end are removed when read.
[22:27:28] <imode> player has cloak? bar is lit; -> bar is dark;
[22:27:45] <imode> this way the "player has cloak" tuple isn't removed, but the "bar is lit" tuple is.
[22:30:23] <gwozniak> I think if I did more concurrent stuff I'd probably look into making a tuple space implementation for the application
[22:30:44] <gwozniak> Not sure I would go so far as to structure a language around it
[22:30:55] <imode> it's an interesting thought experiment.
[22:31:07] <imode> does it behave well as a first principle.
[22:33:33] <gwozniak> I guess what I'm saying is that I don't see the need for a new language to be able to use it
[22:33:52] <imode> never said that.
[22:33:55] <gwozniak> Nothing wrong with a language around it, mind you
[22:34:16] <imode> in the same way that you don't need prolog to use uKanren.
[22:34:24] <imode> but it's interesting to take the idea to the conclusion.
[22:50:37] <manicennui> I've never watched Cowboy Bebop and I've always heard good things about the soundtrack. Finally got around to listening to it and it is really great.
[22:50:56] <manicennui> Too much anime music just sounds like bad Japanese pop.
[22:51:55] <imode> yeh.

[23:00:17] <gwozniak> My wife watches some stuff occasionally. I don't remember what it was either
[23:00:18] <companion_cube> manicennui: I opened a vanguard account and started buying a bit
[23:00:21] <companion_cube> going slowly
[23:00:25] <imode> shramp.
[23:01:41] <manicennui> companion_cube: Ah.
[23:02:14] <manicennui> My employer is doing a stock buy back, which is going to help my RSUs.

[23:04:02] <manicennui> Interested to see what happens when the first vesting happens early next year. I selected the option to sell shares to cover the taxes.
[23:04:09] <companion_cube> do you follow bogleheads wiki or stuff like that?
[23:04:57] <manicennui> Nope.
[23:05:00] <manicennui> Don't know what that is.
[23:05:18] <manicennui> I keep my investing really simple.
[23:05:51] *** Joins: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz)
[23:07:19] <imode> index funds I take it.
[23:07:33] <companion_cube> yeah
[23:07:54] <companion_cube> I mean your advice was like BND and VOO, and it does seem pretty reasonable, can't do simpler than that
[23:08:09] <manicennui> imode: Pretty much.
[23:08:37] <imode> maybe I'll dump some into VOO.
[23:09:34] * manicennui admits to owning some TSLA when it was about $50 per share.
[23:09:51] <manicennui> Unfortunately I sold it after making a very small gain.
[23:10:58] <companion_cube> buying individual stocks seems fun, just for the quick of it
[23:11:21] <manicennui> I do it once in a great while.
[23:11:26] <manicennui> Made quite a bit on COST recently.
[23:11:34] <manicennui> Bought it because I like them as a company.
[23:11:46] <manicennui> It gained enough that I just took my gain.
[23:12:17] <companion_cube> do you also trade these on vanguard, or somewhere else?
[23:13:00] <manicennui> I have multiple accounts.
[23:13:19] <manicennui> I don't actually have a vanguard account. You can buy vanguard ETFs with most trading accounts.
[23:13:39] <companion_cube> oh interesting
[23:15:09] <imode> yeah you can do it via webull or ibkr.
[23:15:22] <imode> if you don't care about order fills as an investor, anything without commission will do.
[23:15:30] <companion_cube> if you already have an account yeah
[23:15:43] <companion_cube> but I had nothing, so I just opened a vanguard account 🤷
[23:15:50] <companion_cube> hu
[23:17:27] <manicennui> From their website it looks like the Vanguard brokerage account is a pretty typical retail brokerage account.
[23:17:35] <manicennui> Should be able to buy whatever.
[23:18:24] <manicennui> I have accounts with Fidelity, ETrade, and Ally.
[23:18:44] <manicennui> And savings/checking with Capital One.
[23:18:56] <companion_cube> oh indeed, gives me access to securities
[23:19:07] <riv> https://ariadne.space/2021/07/14/oracle-cloud-sucks/ very little mention of "pissnet" in this article lol
[23:19:07] <companion_cube> wow, TLSA is 1k/share
[23:19:08] <buttsbot> Oracle cloud sucks – Ariadne's Space
[23:19:48] <manicennui> Yeah, I probably missed out on a huge chunk of gains.
[23:19:51] <manicennui> I try not to think about it.
[23:20:07] <manicennui> I don't think I would have stayed in until $1k.
[23:20:10] <manicennui> Just seems insane now.

[23:24:09] <manicennui> I made about 25% on COST.
[23:24:19] <manicennui> It has continued to go up, but I'm happy with my gain.
[23:24:39] <manicennui> And that was over 4 months.
[23:25:29] <manicennui> Thought I needed the money available to possible put a down payment on something.
[23:25:33] <manicennui> Ended up not doing anything.
[23:25:38] <manicennui> possibly
[23:26:17] <manicennui> companion_cube: Do you have your dividends configured to reinvest?
[23:26:57] <imode> y'all get dividends?

[23:29:01] <companion_cube> the biggest risk is for me to start micromanaging shit too much
[23:29:30] <manicennui> Yeah.
[23:29:37] <manicennui> It can be counterintuitive too.
[23:29:55] <manicennui> When things take a dive, it can be worth buying more.
[23:30:13] <manicennui> But most people want to sell and try to limit their losses.
[23:33:58] <manicennui> Friend just shared a bunch of photos of woodworking and other projects he has done in the last couple of years, making me feel even lazier than usual.
[23:36:23] <imode> meh.
[23:38:53] <riv> i didn't manage to do much at all today
[23:39:11] <riv> i ate 1 cookie more than i wanted to,  instead of 2. i count that as a win
