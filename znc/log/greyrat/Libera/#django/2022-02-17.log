[02:14:36] <rpkilby> FunkyBob: sorry, disconnected, was having some internet issues
[02:14:37] <rpkilby> idk if you responded
[02:16:35] <ktosiek> rpkilby: cookies.items() is an iterator, I think it's only getting forced when the exception is printed
[02:17:23] <rpkilby> ktosiek: but what's confusing is that if I print(cookies.items) it evaluates to an empty dict, but when I raise an exception, it's magically there
[02:17:33] <rpkilby> cookies.itmes() *
[02:18:01] <ktosiek> that's why you get an empty dict in the dict comprehension (this one is fully computed before raising), but some values in the iterator case (which is only initialized before `rise`, but actually computed when the Exception is printed)
[02:18:49] <ktosiek> rpkilby: yup. combining laziness and statefullness is a special kind of fun
[02:19:04] <rpkilby> Here's the more complete example: https://dpaste.org/h8Zq
[02:19:11] <rpkilby> with some exceptions and prints thrown in

[02:20:20] <rpkilby> Basically, my login is simply extending the default django implementation by adding the session cookie to the selenium client
[02:21:25] <rpkilby> the django test client login() method should have alreaady completed. There shouldn't be anything lazy about this
[02:21:48] <FunkyBob> adding a session cookie?  you can't log in without having a session...
[02:21:53] <FunkyBob> so... am confused what you mean
[02:22:27] <rpkilby> I'm logging in the user with the testcases's self.client.login()
[02:22:45] *** Quits: slav0nic (slav0nic@python.su) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[02:22:48] <rpkilby> and my override simply adds the session cookie to the selenium client, so the client is effectively logged in
[02:24:28] <FunkyBob> oh, I see... you're logging in programatically, then injecting the resulting session cookie into Selenium?
[02:24:33] <rpkilby> exactly
[02:24:53] <rpkilby> and tbf, this is something I setup a long time ago in a different project, and maybe I'm doing something very dumb
[02:25:13] <rpkilby> but iirc, this is how you would programatically login your selenium client
[02:25:56] <rpkilby> but regardless, I just cannot reconcile how raise Exception(self.cookies.items()) would... resolve.. the session cookie, but simply printing does not
[02:25:57] <rpkilby> my mind
[02:25:59] <schinckel> You know that the django test client doesn’t access a real server, right? A Selenium client needs a real server.
[02:26:04] <rpkilby> yes
[02:26:09] <schinckel> Just checking ;)
[02:26:54] <rpkilby> It's a whole thing, but basically I have docker setting up a whole qa environment and the dev server and a separate frontend react server are running
[02:28:22] <rpkilby> but I just don't understand... client.login() doesn't issue any kind of web request... it's just setting the session on a dummy request?
[02:28:39] <rpkilby> and I'm just trying to grab the session cookie from the client.cookies
[02:28:50] <schinckel> Yeah, it just sets the stuff up. None of the self.client.get|post actually do a request.
[02:29:08] <rpkilby> yeah, I'm not even at the point of interacting with the selenium client or the web browser yet
[02:29:25] <ktosiek> client.login() simulates login and steals the cookie
[02:29:29] <rpkilby> The cookies are gaslighting me
[02:29:46] <schinckel> In our automated tests, (using RobotFramework) we have a factory that creates a user (and associated data) and logs it in.
[02:30:03] <schinckel> That way we don’t need to have passwords hardcoded in the tests - although you could do that too.
[02:30:27] <schinckel> We do the same in django automated tests.
[02:30:28] <rpkilby> This is missing a few bits, but similar idea (although not fully automatic, QA would be writing these tests)
[02:30:28] <rpkilby> https://dpaste.org/h8Zq
[02:30:35] <schinckel> Always create a new user/company/etc for each test.
[02:30:38] <rpkilby> exactly
[02:30:42] <schinckel> It makes stuff slower, but also makes it isolated.
[02:30:49] <rpkilby> I'm trying to move off of cypress so we can take advantage of all the nice backend integration
[02:30:53] <rpkilby> and test isolation
[02:30:53] <schinckel> 4k tests in 28 minutes is … acceptable.
[02:30:58] <rpkilby> I'd take that
[02:31:26] <schinckel> (That’s in parallel mode in a docker container on a reasonably beefy host)
[02:31:47] <schinckel> Some of our tests run for over a minute, but there’s no way around that for now - they do a bunch.
[02:31:58] <schinckel> We don’t really have distinction between unit and integration tests.
[02:32:31] <rpkilby> these are purely e2e tests

[02:32:53] <rpkilby> there's a whole electron build that we're trying to test (which is part of the motivation of cypress => selenium)
[02:33:15] *** Joins: dodobrain (~dodobrain@user/dodobrain)
[02:33:35] <schinckel> Yeah, our mobile platform (running on meteor) is totally independent - they just hit an API from our django backend.
[02:33:36] <rpkilby> the unit tests would be ran as an entirely separate test suite
[02:33:56] <schinckel> (And we push data through a queue to them, too)
[02:34:17] <rpkilby> In this case, the whole application is packaged up into a desktop electron app, both the frontend and backend
[02:34:34] <rpkilby> so the money is executing the e2e test suite against this built executable
[02:34:46] <rpkilby> and completely automate our QA process
[02:35:01] <rpkilby> because right now our cypress tests just test a smattering of web-only features
[02:35:23] <rpkilby> but anyway, I'm losing my mind over this django client issue
[02:35:28] <rpkilby> I really have no idea what in the hell is going on
[02:36:03] <schinckel> I don’t believe that self.client.login stores anything that could be used _outside_ of self.client
[02:36:16] <schinckel> Have you tried LiveServerTestCase?
[02:36:26] <schinckel> Or whatever it is called.
[02:36:26] <rpkilby> I cannot use it unfortunately
[02:36:35] <schinckel> (Neither can we: why can’t you?)
[02:36:48] <schinckel> (Interested to see if it’s the same reason)
[02:37:02] <rpkilby> The electron backend has its own entrypoint that manages all the internal processes. setting up workers and redis the works
[02:37:30] <schinckel> We have data that is added through migrations - TransactionTestCase and subclasses truncate the database. This then causes subesquent tests to fail.
[02:37:51] <rpkilby> And the frontend is statically built ahead of time, and it's just not feasible to be like "oh your actual endpoint is this entirely different URL"
[02:38:23] <rpkilby> I could change that at build time, but I can't spend minutes rebuilding the frontend everytime we run a test case
[02:39:16] <rpkilby> and again, the live server test case starts up its own server process, but the electron backend needs to handle all the various internal resources and processes.
[02:39:40] <rpkilby> and the goal is to e2e test this in as real an environment as possible. And using the test dev server, stub brokers, etc... just wouldn't cut it
[02:39:55] <schinckel> With our robot framework test cases we don’t use django’s test infrastructure - we just run a server, and point at that.
[02:40:07] <rpkilby> Yeah, that's similar to what we're doing
[02:40:26] <rpkilby> I'm running the server/app/whatever, then using django to run the test suite, but it's basically pointed at the running application
[02:40:37] <schinckel> (Which can all happen in the one process - I have a management command that starts up a server on a designated point, waits for it to start responding and then runs the robot tests)
[02:40:59] <rpkilby> we might want to do something like that in the future, remote/parallelized or whatever
[02:41:00] *** Quits: pepper (~pepper@user/pepper) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[02:41:04] <rpkilby> but that's a future enhancement
[02:41:17] <rpkilby> right now the main goal is just "can we run e2e test against the electron executable"
[02:41:22] <schinckel> But the key point there is that the robot tests are running with access to the database, which means they can create users, and then the robot browser can log in with the user credentials.
[02:41:31] <rpkilby> * and leverage the django backend as part of the test case
[02:41:49] <rpkilby> exactly, I want the test cases to have the ability to directly interact with the backend environment
[02:41:50] <schinckel> ie, I don’t try to “fake” the login, actually sign in normally.
[02:41:59] <rpkilby> so it can manipulate the database, but literally anything else too
[02:42:07] <rpkilby> e.g., files that need to be processed, whatever
[02:42:39] <rpkilby> So the problem is that the desktop app doesn't have a login
[02:42:45] <rpkilby> there is just a user
[02:42:48] <schinckel> One of the reasons I could do that is because robot is a python program, so I can execute it from it’s module, and then the robot steps have access to python from the virtualenv.
[02:43:14] <schinckel> But it would be possible to manually create a session that way too - there’s just no need to in my context.
[02:43:47] <schinckel> But, and I’d have to check, I don’t think TestCase.client actually creates a session - just marks the “in-memory” session as authenticated.
[02:43:52] <rpkilby> Sure, and at this point, regardless of setup, this is more just a "what's happepenning" as I scream into the abyss and I'm determined to understand what's actually going on under the hood

[14:03:13] <serafeim> then, about django.server logger, it mentions > Log messages related to the handling of requests received by the server invoked by the runserver command. HTTP 5XX responses are logged as ERROR messages, 4XX responses are logged as WARNING messages, and everything else is logged as INFO.
[14:04:29] <serafeim> for me this is a little strange: a) The django.server logger is related to the runservver command and will log messages no matter the DEBUG value. *however* the runserver command should *not* be run when DEBUG=False. this is contradictory or i am missing sometihng  ?

[16:48:56] <MangoBango> Hi friends. I'm new to Django and I'm trying to learn the ORM, coming from SQLAlchemy. I'm confused as to whether to use prefetch_related or select_related -- ideally would like a single query. Here is a snippet of what I am attempting to achieve: https://dpaste.org/Zb2R -- help would be hugely appreciated

[16:54:08] <dodo> MangoBango: have you read this yet: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/querysets/#select-related ?
[16:54:56] <MangoBango> I have, but when I specify .select_related('permissions') for example, I get an error "Invalid field name(s) given in select_related: 'permissions'. Choices are: (none)" -- not sure why it says there are no valid options at all
[16:56:46] <MangoBango> dodo: here is an updated snippet, with the error: https://dpaste.org/NkRH
[16:56:56] <dodo> (fwiw, model names should be singular)
[16:57:38] <MangoBango> I will update my model names
[16:59:12] <MangoBango> dodo: Got some progress, updating the model names produces a new error: https://dpaste.org/69VE -- is this referring to a JOIN table?
[16:59:32] <dodo> i think the problem is that you're trying to follow the reverse relation, you need to prefetch for that
[16:59:35] <dodo> afaik
[17:00:09] <dodo> nah, you need new migrations or create a new db if you rename the models, focus on one problem for now?
[17:04:14] <MangoBango> creating the DB again with the updated model names, and using prefetch_related() allows me to access PermissionType.permissions but not PermissionType.permissions.consumer -- so basically one level down only
[17:04:34] <MangoBango> Is it possible to go deeper and get the related for permissions, and consumer, and then consumer.webhooks?

[20:20:32] <theprophet> i dont ask for details, because i know its alot, all i wanna know is where to look
[20:21:40] <theprophet> if i think, that my app is ready for deployment , if i dont use vm , how do i use my Venv and do something, what is that something GinFuyou
[20:22:10] <GinFuyou> Clone it with get to deploy machine, create environment, install requirements, create database, migrate, test, create uwsgi config, add nginx config, collect static, test live, create systemd entries if needed
[20:22:31] <GinFuyou> *with git
[20:23:54] <theprophet> GinFuyou where did you learned that? is there a documentation for that or video tutorial?
[20:24:24] <theprophet> GinFuyou it might be the best way for me to deploy, because i cant use hyper-v
[20:24:35] <theprophet> which is required with vm's
[20:24:53] <GinFuyou> https://blog.tinbrain.net/tutorials/simple-django-deploy.html this covers most of it at least
[20:25:27] <GinFuyou> I've never heard about anyone deploying with VMs
[20:25:34] <GinFuyou> Docker - sure
[20:26:05] <theprophet> GinFuyou why do ii see that people use vms with django then?

[20:27:59] <GinFuyou> what it has to do with vms? I think it's just service provider
[20:28:17] <theprophet> i am not sure maybe i am mistaken
[20:28:25] <theprophet> but he zips his pc django files

[20:31:59] <theprophet> GinFuyou oh ok, docker is not vm, i checked. il watch video how does docker actually work,..  alltough i still wonder, why do people work in vms when deploying django app.
[20:34:16] <GinFuyou> Well, techincally they most likely use in vms. But it's not something of user concern, you just working with *nix server. Unlike with docker, you use docker software on top of it

[20:35:32] <theprophet> GinFuyou is docker alone, enough for deployment?
[20:36:23] <GinFuyou> define "alone". You still need all the usual components to be running. They just run inside docker containers
[20:37:11] <GinFuyou> Which supposedly makes it easier to deploy when you have docker configured on price of having to configure it
[20:37:36] <theprophet> GinFuyou from what you're saying , theres alot to explore about deploying django app.
[20:37:58] <theprophet> alone= only docker software.
[20:38:51] <GinFuyou> You always need at least a wsgi server. Front server (like Nginx) and DB often too
[20:39:11] <GinFuyou> Well, maybe service like heroku run wsgi for you not, sure
[20:40:33] <theprophet> GinFuyou the link you gave me is so confusing, its better if i look a better easier site, ok gin, thank you , for your answers and thanks for eveything.
