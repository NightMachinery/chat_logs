[03:00:27] <rdrg109> [Q] I've already uploaded all the 2021 presentations to Wikimedia Commons. They are available at https://w.wiki/4ZXQ
[03:00:48] <rdrg109> Sorry, that's not a [Q], that's an announcement. The habit...
[03:03:29] <rdrg109> I'd like now to upload the Q&A videos. I can see they are not listed in https://media.emacsconf.org/2021/ , but I can see them in the dedicated pages of each presentation (e.g. https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/structural/ )
[03:04:32] <rdrg109> [Q] Is there an open directory in https://media.emacsconf.org (such as this one https://www.tug.org/texlive/files/ ) where it is possible to see all the files?

[03:49:59] <sachac> not yet, I'll add it to my todo
[03:51:10] <sachac> rdrg109: ugh, I just recompressed all the main videos because the earlier compression settings were too aggressive
[03:51:39] <sachac> I don't know whether you want to reupload them, upload the large original files, etc.
[03:52:04] <sachac> or keep as is, probably okay
[04:14:03] <sachac> rdrg109: added answers to media

[06:52:28] <rdrg109> sachac: Commons allow uploading a new version of a file :) so I can do that
[06:53:45] <rdrg109> btw, is there a file containing the entire conference per each day? I think some pople, as me, would like to see that

[08:10:30] <sachac> rdrg109: whew, that's nice
[08:11:01] <sachac> rdrg109: it would be really big, and it wouldn't have all the Q&A since some of it was on the alternate stream
[08:11:17] <sachac> does Commons support playlists?
[08:15:42] <sachac> bandali: since Commons supports uploading new versions of files, maybe we can consider using that instead of Toobnix for hosting libre copies of the videos
[08:19:54] <rdrg109> sachac: Maybe we can do both (Toobnix and commons). Thus, people in Peertube will find them and people in Commons too.
[08:20:29] <sachac> rdrg109: I vote someone other than me does that going forward. :)
[08:21:00] <sachac> unless I get around to making a script for it
[08:21:04] <sachac> or someone does
[08:22:55] <rdrg109> sachac: What would be the use case for playlists in Commons? AFAIK, Commons doesn't support that, but there are some workarounds (e.g. a sparql query that would list all Emacsconf videos in order)
[08:23:00] <sachac> looks like there are some command-line tools for uploading
[08:23:14] <sachac> rdrg109: instead of the whole-day video you mentioned
[08:25:17] <sachac> lovely, https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Guide_to_batch_uploading
[08:25:52] <rdrg109> People in Wikimedia Commons like using free software and support open resources, so they have relevant tools and will help us if needed (given that Emacs is FLOSS)
[08:26:06] <rdrg109> Not only in Wikimedia Commons, but in Wikimedia in general
[08:27:47] <sachac> any chance you can be in charge of figuring out the automation?
[08:27:56] <rdrg109> Yes
[08:27:59] <sachac> The Q&A videos might be a good testbed
[08:28:15] <sachac> you can scrape the URLs off the media index
[08:28:39] <sachac> so we can test the ability to upload by URL, which will save some time moving bits around
[08:29:14] <sachac> let me know if scraping is not fun for you and I can send you a CSV
[08:30:02] <sachac> title, speaker, date, sha hash, URL?
[08:30:22] <sachac> oh, and talk page URL
[08:31:05] <sachac> actually, I can probably generate that CSV pretty quickly once the kiddo's in bed
[08:31:26] <rdrg109> Ok, let me know. Meanwhile I'll be reading the guide
[08:32:23] <sachac> boo, pattypan won't do webm
[08:35:10] <sachac> rdrg109: might be a python thing, but it could be a good tool in your toolkit if you have lots of other things you want to get into Commons
[08:35:29] <rdrg109> sachac: What you are looking for is that given a URL containg a webm video, the video is added to Commons, right?
[08:35:53] <sachac> yup. plus we can provide other metadata
[08:36:33] <sachac> bonus points if you can have it handle updating
[08:36:48] <sachac> as well (maybe if we provide old sha)
[08:38:14] <sachac> it might be nice to automate all the manual stuff that you've developed a fine appreciation of over the last few days :)
[08:42:42] <sachac> and then we can run it on all the old stuff when given the green light
[08:43:15] <rdrg109> Yes! I'll ask some people in Commons to see if this can be automated. I'm also documenting what I'm doing so that I can then share it on my blog
[08:43:54] <sachac> wonderful! that is the way
[08:44:36] <sachac> and then we can nudge all the other conferences and talks bandali gets swept up in ;)

[09:20:56] <sachac> rdrg109: https://media.emacsconf.org/2021/talks.csv
[09:26:33] <rdrg109> sachac: Thanks!
[09:27:03] <rdrg109> sachac: Last question: Are the "Video URL" the highest quality available? I'm asking because we shouldn't upload compressed files to Commons, since it creates compressed files in different sizes for us, so it would be better if I upload the one with the highest quality.
[11:00:24] <sachac> If bandali is okay with it, I can put the original files up, but many will be too big for the 100MB limit mentioned in the batch upload page and may need server-side batch uploading
[11:05:44] <sachac> although maybe the limits are different for URLs? I'm not sure what the right thing to do is.

[21:09:37] <bandali> sachac, doing both peertube/toobnix and commons sounds good to me
[21:10:13] <sachac> bandali: hah, and I was trying to have less work, not more ;)
[21:10:33] <sachac> oh well, I guess it's time to automate the stuff I don't like to do, or find someone who enjoys doing it
[21:10:43] <bandali> sachac, oops, just noticed that rdrg109 suggested doing both, not you :p
[21:11:08] <bandali> but yeah it should be automated, at least toobnix, especially if we were to do both :)
[21:16:15] <sachac> I should modify the CSV to include the YouTube and Toobnix URLs
