[00:54:53] <ezzieyguywuf> when I do a search and it highlights all occurences of the search, is there a way to limit that to _just_ the current buffer?
[00:55:05] <nickspoon> hwrd: ask vim what the key is currently bound to, and where the mapping was created, e.g.:  :verbose nmap <C-p>   for a ctrl-p mapping
[00:55:33] <hwrd> nickspoon that's all correct, and working on my other OS

[00:55:56] <ezzieyguywuf> dang
[00:56:57] <nickspoon> hwrd: try adding <buffer> in there, to see if there's a buffer-local mapping overriding the global mapping:   :nmap <buffer> <C-p>
[00:56:58] <hwrd> nickspoon yeah. it just won't work on Mac, no matter the terminal emulator. Specifically it's <M-~> but it gets recognized as ` on Mac.
[00:57:13] <nickspoon> Oh an alt key mapping
[00:57:28] <hwrd> yeah
[00:57:36] <nickspoon> Should have led with that
[00:57:39] <hwrd> there's no buffer mapping overriding it.

[00:57:57] <hwrd> is Alt different on Mac? I can't think of what changed in the last couple months
[00:58:04] <nickspoon> no. Alt keys are tricky and vim does different things depending on terminals

[00:59:37] <nickspoon> hwrd: do you have multiple terminals available? Can you try in others?
[01:00:28] <nickspoon> Also try in neovim if you have it - they handle alt/meta mappings differently, so if it _also_ doesn't work in nvim then it might be your terminal

[01:16:23] <hwrd> puremourning actually it's weird. it seems like none of the shift versions work... so I've got <M-`>, <M-[>, and <M-]> working, but <M-~>, <M-{>, and <M-}> don't work on Mac only. Works on Arch. both running wezterm-nightly. I've tried Terminal.app on Mac as well, and it doesn't work there either.
[01:17:03] <puremourning> does 'wezterm' (whatever that is) support modifyOtherKeys mode 2 ?
[01:17:17] <puremourning> because that is the only way that some of those keys can be mapped
[01:17:26] <puremourning> (particularly with shift)

[02:13:54] <hwrd> puremourning yeah with ESC+ it works in iTErm

[02:15:05] <puremourning> check in the session properties, under keys, it should have "Applications can change how keys are reported" ticked
[02:15:11] <puremourning> and CSI u unticked
[02:15:43] <puremourning> i have left-option set to esc+ (with applicatios can change this) and right-option set to normal
[02:16:00] <hwrd> puremourning yeah
[02:16:03] <hwrd> that works
[02:16:28] <puremourning> then check in the menu while vim is running Session -> Terminal State 
[02:16:34] <puremourning> it should say modifyOtherKeys mode 2
[02:16:54] <puremourning> that mode will give you the least surprising behaviour
[02:18:30] <nickspoon> irc_user: I would definitely just have split this with gq or gw. But your script does very specific things and if that's what you want then use it
[02:19:41] <nickspoon> Here's some gq action: https://asciinema.org/a/EAwhQRYGmnBVo4DbpskZo9YaX
[02:20:06] <irc_user> Thanks. I definitely want it to split on every period first, but I care a little less about the comma situation.
[02:20:36] <hwrd> puremourning got it... yeah, gonna report this to wezterm and see what they say
[02:21:05] <puremourning> how prepared are you for a flamewar?
[02:21:28] <hwrd> not very, although the wezterm developer is VERY receptive
[02:21:28] <irc_user> nickspoon: Ohh I see, thanks so much for that video! Really helps me understand.
[02:21:54] <puremourning> suggest you read through this https://invisible-island.net/xterm/modified-keys.html
[02:21:59] <nickspoon> no problem. That's with `set textwidth=80`
[02:22:31] <irc_user> Maybe I can find a way to split on periods first and then use gq on the resulting lines or something.
[02:22:44] <nickspoon> yeah that's what I was just thinking
[02:23:43] <irc_user> Hmm, looks like I could do that easily, my only issue is that the remaining lines aren't so even

[02:25:16] <hwrd> puremourning thanks again for helpning me out
[02:25:41] <nickspoon> That's not quite right because the final line doesn't get split but it's getting there
[02:26:09] <puremourning> you're welcome. fwiw i just checked casey's termbench and iterm2 renders faster than wezterm on my arm macbook pro

[02:26:55] <hwrd> puremourning probably since iterm is specifically for mac. I'm using wezterm purely because it's the "best" (for me), cross platform emulator.
[02:27:10] <hwrd> tired of maintaining multiple configs for different OSes after years and years of doing so
[02:27:20] <puremourning> makes sense i guess
[02:27:25] <nickspoon> irc_user: oh yeah yours splits your lines reasonably evenly so the last line isn't significantly shorter than the others, gq definitely won't do that

[02:27:47] <hwrd> I went from 8 years of iTerm to alacritty, to kitty, to wezterm
[02:28:08] <hwrd> puremourning although iTerm does look really nice for font rendering as I'm playing with it again right now
[02:28:43] <irc_user> nickspoon: Yes exactly. Thank you for the help though, learning about `gq` is nice and `'[,']` as well :)
[02:29:40] <hwrd> puremourning oh a big reason for this is not just the configuration of the terminal emulators themselves...but scripting for WMs across different OSes for launching terminal windows via hotkeys...
[02:29:42] <puremourning> hwrd: yes, the other problem i had (which i pateched in my form) with alacritty was very horrible font rendering, particularly on retina displays. 
[02:29:44] <nickspoon> no problem. I realised what was wrong with my one-liner by the way, it needed a $ before gq(
[02:29:59] <nickspoon> s/\.\s*/.\r/g | '[,']g/\./normal! $gq(
[02:30:41] <puremourning> but tbh i do think wez term has promise

[02:31:46] <puremourning> haha LUAAAA!!!!11111
[02:32:03] <hwrd> good or bad? and what makes you say it has promise?

[02:32:20] <puremourning> OMG IT HAS LUA <3 <3
[02:32:23] <hwrd> difficult to gauge tone over text.

[02:33:41] <puremourning> i say it has promise because it seems to implement a decent amount of the xterm protocol (though not all of it clearly, as modifyOtherKey mode for example) and it isn't so opinionated (and wrong) as alacritty. i've not used kitty as it always just crahsed for me, so can't comment on that.

[02:36:27] <nickspoon> I have found it hard to evaluate kitty, alacritty and others because terminal maintainers get INTENSE with their opinions
[02:36:57] <puremourning> the ligatures are a problem, i hope/assume you can turn them off, but the font itself seems reasonably well done. it looks one of the old bitmap fonts from X which i used to really like and still use with xterm until fairly recently
[02:37:04] <nickspoon> And when they are so domain-knowledgeable and still disagree so strongly with each-other ... it's hard to know what to think
[02:37:18] <puremourning> nickspoon: _exactly_; it's like a culture war just to use a damn VT100 emulator
[02:37:22] <hwrd> puremourning yeah you just change the default config away from the default fonts to get the ligatures off
[02:37:36] <nickspoon> But, I switched to kitty a couple of months ago and like it a lot
[02:37:50] <puremourning> but i ~have to~ get to write LUAR to do taht?
[02:37:54] <irc_user> Haha I've been using alacritty for a long time now, maybe I should try out wez
[02:38:42] <hwrd> puremourning lol
[02:39:01] <nickspoon> I was on termite for years, which I really liked. But the maintainer stopped maintaining it and recommended people move to alacritty. Which I did, but there were some things that were missing and the github issue about them was ... weird ... so I tried kitty and it's excellent
[02:39:04] <puremourning> anyway, terminal emulators are like text editors, there are tons and they all have different features/whatever, and if you're not in the blue team, you're in the red team and we hat the red team

[07:00:38] <siomn> Hello! I have a bit of an odd problem. I'm using a custom colorscheme called almostnothing, which you can find here: http://vpaste.net/tTQyw
[07:01:13] <siomn> if I open a Perl file with "use feature 'signatures'", Vim highlights the name of the argument in red.
[07:01:34] <siomn> So I've tried to add a "hi perlSubPrototypeError" line into my colorscheme.
[07:02:01] <siomn> ... but this *only* fixes the problem if I manually run "colo almostnothing" after starting Vim.
[07:02:20] <siomn> ("colo almostnothing" is in my vimrc, and the theme is working normally in all other ways.)
[07:02:23] <siomn> Any ideas?

[14:15:29] <otisolsen70> So I often see these ^M lineshifts and want to change them to regular newlines. But if I do :%s/^M/\n/ I end up with a lot of ^@ in their place.
[14:15:49] <otisolsen70> If I instead to :%s/^M/\r/ it works.
[14:15:54] <stutz> for replacing it you want \r
[14:16:13] *** Joins: joev (~joev@user/joev)
[14:16:19] <otisolsen70> But why? I mean, it should be \n right? When I seach for it, it needs to be \n for a real newline. And not \r So why must it be \r when I want to inster \n?

[14:38:10] *** Joins: romesrf (~romes@44.190.189.46.rev.vodafone.pt)

[14:45:13] <hajonnes> nova, stutz, I get a nice printout when doing ':e ++enc=cp1252' which changes the way vim reads the file. After I got it nice, how do I save it as nice in utf-8, is it possible?

[14:53:12] <hajonnes> nova, yes!! the fenc worked, thanks a lot!! :D
[14:53:53] <nova> and vim/nvim has a weird way of detecting file encodings. it's with 'fileencodings'. I would suppose yours is the default, but idk - that could mess with stuff when you're starting to edit the file. ah. cool. nvm
[14:54:05] <hajonnes> :e ++enc=cp1252, after that :set fenc=utf-8 and save with 'w'
[14:54:41] <stutz> I'd be careful with that stuff cos changing/converting encodings will almost certainly break one way or another
[14:55:17] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[14:56:15] <hajonnes> stutz, how would you suggest I should do it then? Do you think a program like 'iconv' is safer, or should I just substitue all e.g. <92>.
[14:56:17] <hajonnes> ?
[14:57:21] <stutz> I'd probably use iconv if I had to, yes but because I am old and grumpy I simply accept what ever I receive and don't bother to change anything :D

[14:59:58] <hajonnes> stutz, nova, in what way is iconv better than vim :set fenc=utf-8?
[15:00:15] <hajonnes> or is it just a preference?
[15:02:35] <nova> I don't know the inner workings of either, but iconv seems designed for this, and vim's (and therefore nvim's) file encoding methodology is not focused on converting between encodings. So, I would also probably recommend iconv if you care about doing this often. if it works, though, then it works.
[15:03:06] <nova> wait. this is not #neovim. why did I think I was on #neovim

[18:41:42] <ezzieyguywuf> is there an option to modify the mouse-scroll behaviour? sometimes when I "fling" my scroll (I'm using a trackpad, so I use a two-finger swipe to scroll) and the document gets to the top, it seems to get "stuck", i.e. it seems like it's trying to process additional "scroll up" events but it's unable to do so
[18:42:22] <ezzieyguywuf> I guess in general the request is - is it possible to have a scroll-down cancel any pending scroll-up events (and vice-versa)
