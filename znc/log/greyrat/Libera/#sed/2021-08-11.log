[18:26:56] <bn_work> hi, gsed 4.7 again, if I slurp up a multi-line pattern into a bash var, are newlines filtered out?  I ask as when I echo it, it is all just one line (which is good for my use case) but when I attempt to use it in a subsequent s/// command, I get `gsed: -e expression #1, char 27: unterminated `s' command`, is this because the newlines were actually hidden?  if so, is there a way to echo out a bash var to show any hidden newlines?
[18:27:08] <bn_work> (bash v4.4.12)
[18:27:42] <geirha> newlines are not filtered out, no
[18:27:52] <geirha> and newlines in sed ends a command
[18:28:47] <geirha> if you do echo $var   the variable will be expanded, then it will be split into words based on whitespace, that's where the newlines disappear. Use quotes to prevent word splitting.  echo "$var"
[18:28:57] <geirha> or better: printf '%s\n' "$var"
[18:34:31] <bn_work> geirha: thanks for the reply, I guess that explains the error I'm getting with s/// then.  However, I think I want to strip out the newlines to use in a s/// though so how to do so?
[18:36:25] <bn_work> hmm, I wonder if I can use parameter expansion...
[18:36:56] <Soliton> so $'foo\nbar\n' should become 'foobar'? seems odd.
[18:36:59] <geirha> if you enable extglob, you can do  "${var//+([[:space:]])/ }"  to normalize whitespace. Or add a tr to the command substitution you use initially:   var=$(cmd ... | tr -s '[:space:]' '[ *]')
[18:38:44] <geirha> or you could read it into an array, and just join with space when you expand it
[18:40:58] <geirha> though newlines are far from the only problematic characters when doing sed injection. It may be prudent to switch to awk which allows passing data as data instead of code
[18:42:18] <bn_work> Soliton:  the newlines in this case weren't significant so it seemed easier to just strip them so one can just do a sed s///

[19:49:51] <bn_work> geirha: thanks.  I have extglob enabled so I think for now `${var//+([[:space:]])/ }"` should suffice but just out of curiosity, what would it have looked like in awk?  I use awk infrequently so I always stumble on the syntax if it's been a while.  I wonder if I should just standardize on using awk in all situations instead?  Would it be fair to say awk is a superset of sed in terms of features + performance? or are there things sed 
[19:49:51] <bn_work> can do that awk can't?

[22:08:13] <geirha> depends on what the sed is doing
[22:09:02] <geirha> awk can in practice do everything sed can, but some things are easier to do with sed and vice versa. Knowing both tools are useful
