[01:52:29] <pyzozord> can someone explain how init functions work?
[01:53:09] <pyzozord> is it one init function per file, per package, per module? Is it many? if many what's the order of them?
[01:54:45] <fizzie> Many, and in the order they're declared if I remember. If there are multiple files in the same package, I think the relative order between the files is undefined though.
[01:54:48] <ikke> afaik, one per file, run in alphabetical filename order
[01:54:49] <rudi_s> pyzozord: https://go.dev/ref/spec#Package_initialization and scroll down a bit
[01:55:02] <ikke> oh, multiple per file even
[01:55:20] <teocle> pyzozord: also, if package A imports package B, then B's init() runs before A's init()
[01:55:43] <fizzie> "To ensure reproducible initialization behavior, build systems are encouraged to present multiple files belonging to the same package in lexical file name order to a compiler." So it's not guaranteed to be alphabetical, just "encouraged".
[01:55:55] <fizzie> The same way a mobster would encourage a restaurant owner.

[01:56:53] <pyzozord> s/ugh/uh/
[01:58:05] <rudi_s> Yes, so don't depend on it.
[01:58:10] <pyzozord> Is there a file scope in go? Why are inits per file?
[01:58:39] <fizzie> What do you mean by "per file" exactly?
[01:59:58] <pyzozord> as far as I understand I can define multiple init functions in each file and they all will be called
[02:00:08] *** Joins: ramblebamble (ramblebamb@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/ramblebamble)
[02:00:41] <pyzozord> also from here https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#init "each source file can define its own niladic init function"
[02:01:00] <fizzie> "(Actually each file can have multiple init functions.)"
[02:01:00] <ramblebamble> Hi there, I am using Go 1.17.5 and I am unable to build a static binary is there a way to build one at all in 1.17.5 or is that not possible anymore, because from what I gathered it has become increasingly harder to do so over the years
[02:01:07] <fizzie> The only thing that's really file scope is the scope of a package name introduced by an `import` declaration.
[02:01:09] <teocle> pyzozord: yeah, if you want to control the order, just define individual functions and place them in whatever order is necessary in a single init()
[02:01:15] <b0nn> There's no "per file" scope
[02:01:32] <b0nn> So, multiple inits in a package potentially have race conditions
[02:02:05] <pyzozord> oh so they could be potentially executed in different threads?
[02:02:08] <blinux> So, how is the module and package name different? I example.com/greetings for the module name by just "greetings" for the package name.
[02:02:33] <b0nn> a race condition is predicated on the order of completion, single threaded is still racy
[02:02:34] <fizzie> https://go.dev/ref/spec#Declarations_and_scope has a list of 6 different scopes things can have. The only one that's at the file level is: "3. The scope of the package name of an imported package is the file block of the file containing the import declaration."
[02:03:18] <pyzozord> right so no file scope (except package and imports)
[02:03:24] <b0nn> ^ bring back header files!!!
[02:03:40] <b0nn> but only for imports
[02:03:45] <pyzozord> and init function(s) are many per file and executed in arbitrary order
[02:05:31] <b0nn> inits are a side effect of importing, I'm of the opinion that an explicit run once call is better
[02:05:34] <fizzie> blinux: A module is a collection of packages. The "example.com/greetings" module might consist of packages with import paths like "example.com/greetings" and "example.com/greetings/internal/foo". Each package has a package name as well (the thing declared as `package greetings`), and by convention that matches the last component of the import path. And finally, when importing a package you can
[02:05:35] <fizzie> override the identifier used to refer to that package in the file where you import it.
[02:05:44] <pyzozord> that init thing seems flaky, why add this at all, what's the usecase
[02:06:15] <b0nn> guaranteed to be run when imported
[02:06:52] <b0nn> explicit calls require the person importing to know to runa given method
[02:07:01] <pyzozord> well I guess the real usecase is "add non-breaking init logic to your library"
[02:08:02] <b0nn> you often see import _ "foo" // that's the developer running an init (eg for a databse driver)
[02:08:13] <ramblebamble> ok, apparently I am already building a static binary when using ldd I am  greeted with "not a dynamic executable" -.-, can you guys then maybe tell me why it is throwing memory exceptions when run inside a scratch-docker-image?
[02:08:15] <pyzozord> I guess? Because otherwise if I can't control or relay on the order of these imports they are really very limited in usefulness
[02:09:42] <b0nn> ramblebamble: link to the code you are building, the commands that you run, and the errors produced
[02:10:19] <b0nn> Go itself produces a statically linked binary, but if you are doing cgo stuff - I unno
[02:10:59] <b0nn> and, if your code contains unsafe stuff.. also, I unno
[02:12:06] <blinux> fizzie: OK, thank you. It may make more sense to me as I keep going. The module init file and package name and import seemed like maybe they should also specify the module, but the package decleration does not.
[02:12:50] <ramblebamble> b0nn, I have been using various combinations unsuccessfully, -tags "os.....,net", CGO_ENABLED=0 also exporting it, tried go install --installsuffix cgo, and the panic always occures when I try to read the body of an http response(using the build in library)

[02:23:57] <b0nn> the build is fine
[02:24:00] <ramblebamble> I am creating a buffer and read it after the http-library processed it. it is running inside a subroutine
[02:24:28] <b0nn> it looks like keys is nil
[02:24:48] <ramblebamble> yes and it also runs when I run it inside e.g. the google golang docker-container or my system, so the data-access/lifetime should be fine, it only fails, once I try to run it inside a scratch docker-image
[02:25:46] <b0nn> heh, I'm not going to try and troubleshoot via IRC a problem where I am not being given all of the information required or requested.
[02:27:36] <ramblebamble> BAI am currently working on the minimal example, I was actually just hoping for the propper compiler switches(after all they appear to have changed over the years as well), or a note saying, the http-library cannot run in a subroutine without CGO or stuff like that
[02:28:33] <lazyreader> there should be no special compiler switches needed other than CGO_ENABLED=0 to produce a static binary, unless you're actively doing something complicated
[02:29:27] <lazyreader> the stdlib http server runs in a goroutine just fine - everything is in a goroutine in go, in some sense, even main.
[02:30:53] <lazyreader> if it works in a "normal" container but not a scratch container, you must be trying to load something off the filesystem that you're not including in the container.
[02:31:49] <ramblebamble> lazyreader, nope that operation is working fine, b0nn, the minimal example https://pastebin.com/9CyF6cZF
[02:32:35] <ramblebamble> let's ignore the fact that I am not casting the buffer and a matrix is printed, the program runs on my system Linux X64_86, I create the container and try to run the container, it fails

[02:39:44] <ramblebamble> Actually, it isquite peculiar, when all I do is insert println statements, and execute the binary(in the system and in the container) it works, so the build and the steps are correct
[02:41:02] <lazyreader> ok, so let's go back to your nil pointer dereference. what is the _real_ code that you're seeing have this issue? because that error trace doesn't match the code you provided.
[02:41:03] <ramblebamble> lazyreader,b0nn, So I must assume that, although the error-messages are different, the underlying cause might be related as both codes my project and the minimal example, fail the moment I introduce  byte-buffers and access them , so it is my minimal example
[02:41:48] <lazyreader> what do you mean by "introduce byte-buffers and access them"
[02:42:07] <lazyreader> your minimal example prints an empty buffer of 0s and exits when I run it.

[03:04:21] <pyzozord> make(map[key-type]value-type) seems to allocate memory for a map on heap, is there a waye to allocate a map on stack?
[03:06:03] <lazyreader> https://go.dev/doc/faq#stack_or_heap : if the compiler cannot prove that the variable is not referenced after the function returns, then the compiler must allocate the variable on the garbage-collected heap to avoid dangling pointer errors. Also, if a local variable is very large, it might make more sense to store it on the heap rather than the
[03:06:03] <lazyreader> stack.
[03:06:22] <lazyreader> there's no way to directly control this from the language.
[03:07:41] <lazyreader> why do you want to try and force it onto the stack?
[03:08:35] <pyzozord> because "The storage location does have an effect on writing efficient programs."
[03:08:39] <b0nn> related to a conversation recently about zero values, I'm not 100% sure that maps /can/ be built on the stack
[03:09:19] <b0nn> also, how are you determining if the map is being built on the heap or the stack?
[03:09:48] <pyzozord> I am guessing. It seems easier to implement it on heap from C perspective
[03:09:55] <pyzozord> but that's why I asked
[03:10:22] <b0nn> honestly, the only way to be sure is to inspect the compiler and runtime code
[03:10:37] <b0nn> But, as I say, I'm personally not 100% sure on the rules for maps
[03:10:46] <pyzozord> ok I see
[03:11:22] <pyzozord> the most canonical hashmap example from K&R's C is full of linked lists with each item of a list being a separate heap allocation
[03:11:23] <lazyreader> if you think there's a performance impact, write a Benchmark test to see if it matters
[03:11:51] <b0nn> compile a simple program with a function that has a map, that assigns a key (so it's used) but never prints it or passes it about, and run the escape analyser over it
[03:12:12] <lazyreader> https://medium.com/eureka-engineering/understanding-allocations-in-go-stack-heap-memory-9a2631b5035d see this blog post for tips on that
[03:14:54] <pyzozord> thanks
[03:15:06] <fizzie> I'd be kind of surprised if the compiler ever did build _actual_ hashmaps on the stack. Seems like it'd be quite the hassle when e.g. resizing the bucket array.
[03:16:03] <pyzozord> yes, that was my assumption to
[03:16:06] <lazyreader> https://dave.cheney.net/2018/05/29/how-the-go-runtime-implements-maps-efficiently-without-generics
[03:16:26] <b0nn> https://go.dev/play/p/ce1CMVCWmOC
[03:16:42] <b0nn> Apparently maps don't escape after all (TIL)
[03:16:44] <lazyreader> if you're curious about the details of how go's hashmap is implemented
[03:17:41] <pyzozord> is the idea of escaping a synonim of escaping stack data to heap?
[03:17:49] <lazyreader> yes.
[03:18:11] <pyzozord> in other words, do all "not escaped" values live on stack and all "escaped" values live on heap?
[03:20:37] *** Quits: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:20:39] <lazyreader> I don't know if you'd see someone using the term that broadly. "escape" just means "the compiler believes this value will outlive its function, and therefore 'escapes' into the heap"
[03:21:16] <fizzie> Given that a map value is basically full of pointers, I definitely wouldn't take the fact that the map object doesn't escape as a sign that the actual data of the map is allocated on the stack, if that's what you're mostly curious about.
[03:21:51] <b0nn> I wonder if it's like other objects that are too big for a given stack so get shifted to the heap
[03:21:58] <pyzozord> yes, it seems like the idea of escaping and stack/heap are not tied that closely together
[03:22:01] <lazyreader> again, the point of all this is: don't try and reason too hard about it unless you've determined that it's actually a performance bottleneck

[03:22:17] <pyzozord> when value escapes it always migrates to heap. But that doesn't mean it couldn't have been there already
[03:22:30] <b0nn> that is - once a map gets n keys with values that exceed the limit - off you pop to the heap mr bloaty map
[03:22:49] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[03:24:25] <b0nn> I *think* that proper analysis can be done with dumpheap and dumpstack *or* gaining knowledge about the memory address of the stacks and heap and calculating where the object is
[03:24:34] <b0nn> Or, look at the code
[03:25:19] <pyzozord> seems like go really doesn't want you to think about memory
[03:25:35] <b0nn> Runeimt: https://go.dev/src/runtime/ and Compiler: https://go.dev/src/cmd/compile/
[03:25:36] <pyzozord> but on the other hand it does want you to think about pointers and memory layout in structs
[03:26:09] <b0nn> heh - the whole point of the GC was to take the burden of memory management off devs
[03:26:28] <b0nn> and Go's pointers aren't an exact match to (say) C or C++ pointers
[03:26:34] <lazyreader> it wants you to think about pointers in the sense of "I want a shared copy of this or not", not pointer math
[03:26:44] <b0nn> unsafe.Pointer is closest
[03:27:36] <lazyreader> honestly I haven't see struct memory layout come up too often
[03:27:49] <lazyreader> (as a practical concern)
[03:28:14] <johnjaye> isn't that not a pointer at all then, just a reference?
[03:28:18] <johnjaye> to use java speak
[03:28:24] <pyzozord> I can't quite get into the go headspace
[03:28:28] *** Joins: ramblebamble (ramblebamb@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/ramblebamble)
[03:28:31] <johnjaye> the whole "point" of pointers is to do arithmetic with them
[03:29:02] <pyzozord> how do you worry about performance with a unpredictable garbage collector, how do you worry about memory without control over stack/heap
[03:29:09] <b0nn> johnjaye: in my mind they are closer to java's references, yes, but, again, they don't overlap exactly
[03:30:18] <pyzozord> Do I just don't worry about it until it's a problem? And then when it's a problem what do I do.
[03:30:45] <lazyreader> honestly: if your constraints are such that you have strong real-time performance requirements and cannot abide unpredictable GC behavior or memory usage, go may not be a good fit for the problem
[03:30:59] <b0nn> pyzozord: what everybody does - look for bottlenecks and see how to optimise them
[03:31:11] *** Joins: hanzo (uid532183@user/hanzo)
[03:31:23] <lazyreader> and go does give you good tools for benchmarking and testing
[03:31:36] <b0nn> pproff is quite the helper
[03:31:38] <pyzozord> ok so I should think of go as a bit closer to python than to c
[03:32:06] <b0nn> closer to java than python :)
[03:32:09] <pyzozord> I put it right in the middle between python and c, and assumed it comes with full control over memory if I want it
[03:32:33] <lazyreader> it's certainly higher-level than C, which wants to pretend the universe is a PDP-7
[03:32:35] <pyzozord> but it seems now that go is actually somewhat closer to python and further from c
[03:32:40] <ramblebamble> lazyreader, just giving some feedback. The error had a .go at the end so I started digging some more, turns out for the simple example with the matrix being printed out, the solution was to ad GOOS and GOARCH, which I thought strage as the images themselves are usually running the same Architecture and OS as the host and go would also build it like that I assume, anyways, fixed that problem, but
[03:32:42] <ramblebamble> not other one, but at this point I cannot care any longer, just opted for alpine, is small enought for me and solves my problem as well
[03:33:14] <lazyreader> the fact that it has a .go at the end is because docker is written in go
[03:33:23] <lazyreader> and the error message is coming out of docker
[03:33:32] * ramblebamble facepalms
[03:33:35] <ramblebamble> ok that makes sense
[03:33:36] <lazyreader> I mentioned GOOS and GOARCH
[03:33:47] <ramblebamble> yes you did
[03:34:06] <ramblebamble> but I did not expect it to matter as I did not want to change my architecture
[03:34:14] <ramblebamble> or the os I am compiling for
[03:34:34] <lazyreader> apparently something differed between your compiler host and your docker environment.
[03:35:39] <ramblebamble> no I punched in GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 and those are that is describing my system
[03:36:18] <lazyreader> ok

[14:21:01] <j416> that one yes
[14:21:29] <j416> that and the language spec is pretty much all I read when I was new to the language
[14:21:38] <j416> I thought it was plenty enough for the time
[14:22:22] <j416> what's missing are things that are maybe difficult to teach anyway, like idiomatic style and project structure, conventions.
[14:22:38] <j416> but it covers the language well
[14:23:26] <pyzozord> yes the less technical things like engineering with go or more technical things like implementation of go
[14:29:58] <bookworm> go is written in go, you can simply look at the internal for all the nitty gritty details. Higher level summaries are usually available from the gophercon talks

[14:36:35] <pyzozord> nice will check out gophercon
[14:37:22] <pyzozord> to be clear, I'm not particularly interested in how go is implemented in code although it's very cool I can just check it out since it's written in go. I'm more interested in high level overview of the low level implementation so to speak
[14:38:18] <pyzozord> I want to understand how it works under the hood without being bothered about what particular code is used to implement these ideas.
[14:39:02] <pyzozord> It's a bit hard to explain what I am looking for. I guess I want a step below the language but not all the way down to looking at the source code of go
[14:39:14] <bookworm> you can't really separate the two as the chosen algorithms and datastructures imply a certain behavior\
[14:39:43] <bookworm> depending on how "deep" you are actually trying to understand it
[14:40:07] <ikke> pyzozord: maybe https://go.dev/ref/spec?
[14:40:09] <bookworm> also relying too much on those things is dangerous
[14:40:18] <ikke> though that's mostly the language specification
[14:40:26] <bookworm> code against the spec, not against the current behavior of the compiler
[14:40:50] <pyzozord> ikke: that's on my list as well, maybe that's in there indeed. I haven't looked at it yet.
[14:40:56] <bookworm> they are free to change the implementation as long as they still adhere to the spec, meaning if you start to micro optimize things because it's faster today it may be horrid in the future
[14:42:05] <pyzozord> yeah that sounds right
[14:42:20] <pyzozord> indeed maybe I just need to read the spec

I was too obsessed with somme obfuscated reason
[17:49:04] <ramblebamble> and checking it locally will therefore not result in the clue giving error-message I omitted trying to debug that thing in the container

[21:00:09] <pyzozord> both

[21:03:30] <lazyreader> alright. I ask mainly because your questions seem very... undirected? like, as someone who writes a lot of go, they strike me as pretty useless to actually using the language. but you know how you learn best, I suppose.

[21:06:19] <pyzozord> yes, to be completly honest I'm looking for ways to hang the new knoweledge on the existing things in my brain
[21:12:23] <seebs> in my experience, "knowing how it is actually implemented" is very often actively harmful to attempts to *use* a thing effectively, because "how it is actually implemented" is a transient implementation detail which can change.
[21:12:40] <seebs> if you are thinking about it, you're thinking about something that isn't actually your problem and its problem space and that's usually a loss to effectiveness.
[21:13:57] <pyzozord> I'm not necessairly going to think about it when I write programs. But on odd occasion it comes in useful if only for conceptualization where a bug might be

[22:42:22] <albertito> pyzozord: fwiw I think what you're doing is just fine, learning how something works is often beneficial, and learning not to rely on internals/implementation details too much goes hand in hand with that (as you already mentioned)
[22:44:05] <albertito> pyzozord: regarding your question, I think you might be confused due to "go list"'s use of the template package, which is for text processing (and indeed uses reflection)

[22:46:34] <albertito> pyzozord: the output formatting is done using a text/template string, and that module uses reflection. That's documented in the help (which you can find at the top of that file you linked)

[22:50:36] <albertito> pyzozord: the part you're asking about (how it gets the information about your structs) is not in that file, it's in the "load" and "modload" packages, you can find the calls there, e.g. in the loadPackageList function
[22:50:55] *** Joins: TheCoffeMaker (~TheCoffeM@user/thecoffemaker)
[22:51:12] <albertito> pyzozord: and the general answer is: it parses your source code to get that information, it doesn't use your binary
[22:52:20] <pyzozord> got it!
[22:52:39] <albertito> pyzozord: you are also right that (some of) the information _is_ available at runtime though, and available via the reflect package. But that's not what go list uses

[23:46:36] <be3uykpy> hi
[23:47:32] <be3uykpy> this is more of a helm question but since it uses go's templating language, it might be relevant here? what's the "-" used for in {{- if }} ... {{- end}}    ?
[23:47:48] <be3uykpy> why add "-" when {{ if }} ... {{ end }} works just fine?
[23:49:34] <b0nn> if an action's left delimiter (by default "{{") is followed immediately by a minus sign and white space, all trailing white space is trimmed from the immediately preceding text.
[23:49:45] <b0nn> Similarly, if the right delimiter ("}}") is preceded by white space and a minus sign, all leading white space is trimmed from the immediately following text.
[23:49:52] <b0nn> https://pkg.go.dev/text/template
[23:51:02] <pyzozord> be3uykpy: I think you can find out about it in go doc text/template
[23:51:46] <pyzozord> I think {{- stuff}} trims white space preceeding this token
[23:52:01] <be3uykpy> thanks so much
[23:52:19] <pyzozord> good to know helm uses go templates
