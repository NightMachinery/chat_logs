[00:58:53] <catern-> I wonder if one could found a corporation which is, completely, just a shell over some of the good economics ideas people have had for more efficient markets; like prediction markets and Harberger taxes
[00:59:10] <catern-> It would have its own internal property law etc
[00:59:33] <gwern> yes, you can try. that's how georgist communities and some of the utopian experiments work: encode the new ideas into contract law
[00:59:45] <catern-> Could such a corporation grow to the size of the entire economy by being more efficient?
[01:00:16] <catern-> It would just be a contractual hack to create a space for new economics inside the old economy
[01:00:28] <gwern> unfortunately, it is often quite difficult to make it work because of the larger units. georgist towns get only a small fraction of the benefits because they have to be located in nowhere to afford the capital costs, and you are still paying all of the capital gains and income and sales and excise and tariffs and... taxes
[01:00:29] <catern-> (and there would be sub-corporations within this shell)
[01:00:55] <catern-> Hm
[01:01:16] <gwern> there are also many limits set to what you are legally allowed to require in contracts for property, often justified in the name of eliminating racial covenants or redlining etc
[01:01:40] <catern-> Hmm
[01:01:51] * filipepe googles georgist communities
[01:01:54] <catern-> The obvious fix there is: Stop trying to make a town
[01:02:01] <gwern> eg you might want to impose a harberger tax on a planned community... but now you're fighting a billion renter regulations
[01:02:26] <gwern> good luck having harberger efficiently allocate property when your renters can halt it in its tracks for a few years fighting eviction
[01:02:58] <catern-> i.e. stop trying to centralize in one place, just be an "overlay economy" (like an overlay network in networking - which is a powerful technique for academic network researchers to try out new techniques)
[01:03:00] <gwern> filipepe: I believe there's one in new jersey that I'm especially thinking of
[01:03:12] <gwern> https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.28.20180414v1 neat

[01:03:17] <catern-> gwern: Harberger isn't just for real property though, it's for all property
[01:03:38] <dbohdan> gwern: I've considered the problem of buying and never using domains and have come to the conclusion that the solution is subdomains.  You can migrate from a subdomain to a second-level domain later.  (The downside is that if your project becomes a success overnight, you risk domain scalping.)
[01:03:44] <gwern> catern-: real estate is where the biggest gains are. there's not much gain from harbgering your teaspoons
[01:04:11] <catern-> gwern: well, I'm thinking more about in the context of the productive corporate economy
[01:05:19] <catern-> gwern: I guess it's nice to have Harberger taxes to get better allocative efficiency for factories, but it's also quite nice for, like... I don't know, racks in datacenters? IP? stock?
[01:05:41] <catern-> (those last two aren't physical property but I'm sure there's more physical property examples)
[01:05:44] <gwern> stock is already generally so liquid I can't imagine harberger really mattering
[01:05:51] <gwern> public stocks, anyway
[01:05:57] <catern-> did you see Hanson's post on that?

[01:06:14] <Robomot> Overcoming Bias : Super Hostile Takeovers
[01:06:46] <catern-> That's the kind of thing that makes me think an "overlay economy" could outcompete the outsiders...
[01:07:41] <catern-> (that is, I do actually think that we have economics ideas which could maybe provide much more improvement than Georgism would have)
[01:07:46] <catern-> (nowadays)
[01:08:21] <gwern> catern-: that doesn't give much of an estimate of the allocative losses
[01:08:58] *** catern- is now known as catern
[01:09:27] <catern> gwern: what do you mean by "allocative losses"? what loss are you envisioning?
[01:10:25] <gwern> the difference between the current allocation and the better allocation that harberger-enabled takeovers could enable. a stat like '40% premium' doesn't really tell you anything about how many takeovers are frustrated, or what the gain would be per takeover
[01:11:03] <catern> (so this "stub corporation" would employ everyone participating in it, and I guess as part of that it could provide a universal basic income/negative income tax or something, as the formal wage that it pays its employees)
[01:11:15] <gwern> whereas posner gives estimates about total GDP tripling or whatever from bad allocation of real estate
[01:11:50] <gwern> which is surely wrong as a simplified model of everything but at least indicates that we're not talking about minor allocative losses
[01:12:58] <catern> gwern: ah, sure. I mean, it sounds intuitively plausible to me, takeovers are hard and this is a very elegant way to solve a lot of annoying market microstructure issues in equity markets; but yes, some more firm stats would be good before embarking on a big project including this, heh

[01:14:38] <catern> surely someone has had this idea before, right? obviously many people have talked about "internal markets" inside corporations, which have failed (why, exactly? I haven't gotten to the part in /Backstop where you talk about it :) ) and maybe they've failed because the friction of being corporate-internal makes them less useful than the real external market
[01:14:59] <catern> but if you make the internal market *better* than the external market... by changing property laws and fixing things etc...
[01:15:34] <catern> then maybe there's enough advantage in the structure of the internal market, to overcome the friction of not being in contact with the "real" external market?

[03:07:49] <Gurkenglas> the purpose of god beyond interactive proofs would be to remove the necessity of defining what it means for the devil to have tried his best, so long as you can define a utility function and a competent decision theory
[03:08:10] <gwern> Gurkenglas: I think the idea would be something more like, 'ask the devil for a constructive proof of a faster god'
[03:09:11] <gwern> the fast-god algorithm might be an extremely short program when written done, but incomprehensible; so the devil has to provide the, potentially extremely long, proof which can then be PCP checked
[03:09:49] <Gurkenglas> because god might decide to restrict himself to a computable successor agent in order for there to be a constructible faster god? sounds like just another message
[03:11:23] <Gurkenglas> you don't need god to be instantiable as a program, you just need the devil to prove that god would approve an output, and this proof could be quite short if the devil is simple, as in robust cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma

[05:01:24] <kuudes> so that is then not enough
[05:01:39] <kuudes> iir delta r0 ~8 has been pondered
[05:01:56] <kuudes> so then full vaccination would take r to about 2

[06:01:26] <PlanckWalk> kuudes: If the vaccination prevalence is as high as it can ever go, and you still can't reduce transmission below R=1, then correct: you had better not ever open up.

[06:12:06] <gwern> baidu strikes back
[06:13:19] <PlanckWalk> kuudes: The population distribution of deaths due to COVID is nothing like the distribution due to car accidents though.
[06:13:55] <PlanckWalk> Especially if you look at it in terms of "average years of life lost"
[06:15:37] <PlanckWalk> With a reduction to 10% of the unvaccinated harm rate (if reasonably constant across lifespan), COVID drops below other risks in every age group.
[06:17:01] <PlanckWalk> If vaccination protected the elderly disproportionately more that might not be true.  I don't think that's the case though.
[06:19:35] <PlanckWalk> Digging a bit deeper, it looks like it would become comparable in vaccinated people to the effects of flu in unvaccinated people.
[06:21:21] <PlanckWalk> (on the population deaths-or-probablelasting-harm level, not individual)
[06:32:18] <PlanckWalk> Actually it looks like many influenza cases are also asymptomatic or with very mild symptoms, so maybe more similar than I thought.

[06:45:43] <nshepperd> in real life, it's likely that some portion of the difference between the vaccine effectiveness and 100% can be attributed to differences between people, in which case you have a different equilibrium
[06:50:03] <PlanckWalk> Well yes, you mostly get a "still susceptible" population and a "essentially immune" population.
[06:50:36] <PlanckWalk> But very few people will know which one they're in, and I think the public health risks are similar.
[06:51:12] <nshepperd> for instance, if the vaccine fully protects 0.75 of people, and leaves the rest unaffected, hard immunity will be after 1/2 of the ineffective vaccine cohort will be infected,  or 1/8 of the population
[06:51:28] <saturn2> it seems like america won't be willing to do another pseudolockdown in any case
[06:51:43] <PlanckWalk> Very likely, I think we're mostly talking about finland originally.

[06:53:15] <Robomot> Durability of Responses after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 Vaccination | NEJM (Correspondence from The New England Journal of Medicine — Durability of Responses after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 Vaccination)
[06:54:15] <PlanckWalk> I think there are such variations for all vaccines, but for some diseases (e.g. measles) the wide range doesn't matter as much.
[06:55:28] <PlanckWalk> For measles the median is so far above "effectively immune" that a reduction by a factor of 10 still means immune.

[07:30:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ralith: I am not a big fan of either...
[07:30:24] <nshepperd> white chocolate is just chocolate with the best part removed, why bother

[07:30:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like I don't hate it but it seems too sweet and not enough ... chocolatey
[07:30:57] <Ralith> adiabatty: most of the stuff that looks like white chocolate is actually made of palm oil

[07:31:43] <adiabatty> I'm around a lot of white-chocolate haters for the reason you guys said and that makes me think I'm getting my mind twisted into thinking it's less good than it is

[07:35:02] <gwern> yeah, I suspect as much. I think it's like Slurpees
[07:35:12] <gwern> I liked them as a kid but now even the thought is nauseating
[07:39:46] <Ralith> it would be interesting to contrast white chocolate fudge with unflavored fudge
[07:39:54] <Ralith> I guess that's basically butter vs cocoa butter
[07:40:39] <gwern> hm... I've had plain fudge. didn't really strike me as being 'white chocolate but softer'
[07:43:49] <Ralith> aside from choice of fat it's the same ingredients, but maybe wildly different ratios and crystal structures
[07:45:26] <gwern> I'd expect so. just the texture is hugely different
[07:45:33] <gwern> the fat may also have distinct flavors too
[07:47:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I haven't had a lot of fudge so I can't weigh in on this
[07:47:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fudge has always seemed somewhat weird to me tbh
[07:48:51] <ggreer> Solution: adult slurpees aka blended margaritas
[07:49:09] <Ralith> the fats absolutely have different flavors
[07:49:19] <gwern> yeah, there's an odd thing about fudge. it's present in culture much more than actually consumed, it seems
[07:50:13] <gwern> like, most of the fudge I've eaten, I've bought from... Six Flags? or another theme park. because their confectionary store will have a big display of fresh fudge and it's pretty much the only place you see it so I buy some on the way out
[07:50:26] <gwern> but, everyone knows what fudge is!
[07:50:46] <gwern> it's like Turkish Delight. many americans know it because of Narnia. how many have *eaten* it?
[07:51:41] <nshepperd> about as many as have regretted eating it

[13:45:07] <two2thehead> "So Doherty was thrilled when he found out that doctors were testing a new way to try to treat amyloidosis. The approach used a revolutionary gene-editing technique called CRISPR, which allows scientists to make very precise changes in DNA.
[13:45:07] <two2thehead> "I thought: Fantastic. I jumped at the opportunity," Doherty says.
[13:45:07] <two2thehead> On Saturday, researchers reported the first data indicating that the experimental treatment worked, causing levels of the destructive protein to plummet in Doherty's body and the bodies of five other patients treated with the approach.
[13:45:07] <two2thehead> "I feel fantastic," Doherty says. "It's just phenomenal."
[13:45:09] <two2thehead> The advance is being hailed not just for amyloidosis patients but also as a proof-of-concept that CRISPR could be used to treat many other, much more common diseases. It's a new way of using the innovative technology."

Maybe Elixir Discords have standardized on something by now?  It doesn't help that adoption seems to be growing slower than the technology's proponents expected a few years ago.

[17:01:26] <feep> if a key means the same as in node.js, it should also do the same thing

[17:01:47] <dbohdan> I am not sure
[17:02:00] <feep> well if it doesn't, it's totally defeating the point of json :v

[18:23:23] <Betawolf> wait, no, that's a distortion. The rate of hospitalisations in the UK is about that, given our current national vaccination status.

[18:48:45] <gwern> they lost a domain of theirs? that's quite the fuck up
[18:49:24] <PlanckWalk> kuudes: Yes, I would expect numbers within that order of magnitude.  The main difference is that COVID (even after vaccination) kills a lot fewer people under 65, whiel car crashes kill more people under 65.
[18:51:14] <PlanckWalk> I think you'd find that in every age group (after vaccination), even without sufficient reduction in infections COVID would only add a small amount to mortality risk in every age group.

[20:50:31] <dbohdan> Do you think the "learn Mandarin because most open source code will come from China soon" meme has some validity to it?  Today I kind of felt it with https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub.  However, it doesn't seem like Mandarin is a good investment if you don't want to know it for other reasons.  Most projects of note are started in English and are documented in English even when it isn't their primary language.  Machine translation also keeps getting 
[20:50:32] <dbohdan> better (and it is already decent for Chinese compared to Japanese).

[20:52:17] <ggreer> I don't know. mandarin is extremely hard to learn and lets you better interact with china. but you can't become chinese like you can become american or canadian or british. best case you visit china for some years or manage to get better trade/sales with chinese people
[20:53:22] <adiabatic> back five years ago chinese people weren't on github
[20:53:46] <adiabatic> now they pop up every so often in contributors lists and as project creators
[20:53:59] <ggreer> also there are far more english speaking people than there are chinese speaking people
[20:54:34] <adiabatic> "five years" is probably a useful benchmark because it'll probably take you at least that long to get adequate in mandarin
[20:55:23] <adiabatic> I was reading Borges in four years of Spanish, but Mandarin isn't that easy and four to five years of Mandarin study won't get you quite as proficient as that same time thrown at Spanish
[20:56:14] <ggreer> I think mandarin is a stupid language. everyone likes to make fun of english for its shitty spelling, but mandarin has no connection between the sound and the character
[20:56:18] <adiabatic> er, reading Borges at more or less an English pace. I was reading Borges in Spanish 3 too, but that was two pages per class meeting because there was just so much vocab to grind
[20:57:03] <adiabatic> eh, it's stupid for us but their writing system lets them paper over a *lot* of spoken-language pronunciation diversity
[20:57:47] <ggreer> also codebases tend to be in one language. if they're in multiple languages, english is one of them
[20:58:04] <ggreer> I figure anyone in china who wants non-chinese contributors will try their best to use english
[20:58:25] <gwern> (which is ironic because borges is noted for his very simple plain spanish style compared to many spanish stylists, no?)
[20:59:05] <gwern> but no, learning mandarin is a terrible idea unless you are going to live in china for the rest of your life
[20:59:37] <nshepperd2> which is itself a terrible idea
[21:00:45] <adiabatic> the trouble we had with Borges was that his stories were kind of hard in a Greg Egan sense — when we read El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan (The Garden of Forking Paths), our teacher said that he was convinced we would have trouble understanding what was going on even if it were in English
[21:01:25] <adiabatic> …which, quite honestly, is a fair assessment, especially if you're only reading two pages a day instead of being able to read the entire thing in a sitting
