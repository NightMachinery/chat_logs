In my case I receive errors of this kind: <https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=267124>, <https://github.com/alsa-project/alsa-lib/issues/155>.

[15:12:30] <LilUFO> I figured

[15:12:44] <moha> Is it possible to config for ntp server to be set on time zone? (my boss asking!)
[15:13:10] <moha> He means when a client is asking for time, ntp says local time? does it make sense?
[15:14:05] <grawity> no, it doesn't
[15:14:07] <niki> NTP should be UTC and your client should to the timezone, anything else would be madness, but some people are mad
[15:14:22] <grawity> ntp always deals with utc time, if it doesn't then it literally isn't ntp
[15:14:56] *** Joins: cmnky (~cmnky@user/cmnky)

[19:15:45] <aegidius> Hi all. I'm trying to install Arch with encrypted root partition and Grub. I have mounted the *mapped* partition on `/mnt` and the boot partition (not encrypted) on the `/mnt/efi` directory. I have done `arch-chroot /mnt`, installed `grub` package, updated `/etc/default/grub` to use the cryptroot. The I did `grub-install` and `grub-cfg` but when
[19:15:45] <aegidius> booting it says it can't find a partition, and prints a UUID. That UUID is the one of the mapper device. Can you please help me?
[19:17:19] <aegidius> The `grub.cfg` file is in the `/boot/grub` directory, which is encrypted, while grub is installed in the boot partition which is not encrypted. Is that wrong?
[19:18:10] <Scimmia> you missed configuring mkinitcpio
[19:18:26] <aegidius> I did actually
[19:18:52] <aegidius> I added the `encrypted` or something `HOOK` and regenerated with `-P`
[19:18:57] <aegidius> Shall I do it again?
[19:19:23] <aegidius> Also, is it correct doing `grub-makecfg` from `arch-chroot`? I don't know any other way

[19:49:44] <quantum_> Seems ike doing it this way would run the traffic over the LAN in the clear, presenting a security problem.
[19:51:31] <ramblebamble> Hi there! Long time Archuser here, first time writer. I was just wondering if there was an update made to arch recently that could explain why transmission-remote is lagging. I could not find a package that would explain it. Previously running transmissino-remote without transmission-daemon running return immediately, but it now hangs until it hits the timeout
[19:51:45] <quantum_> A socks 5 proxy would work, but how to direct a particular app to it which does not support proxies?

[23:34:30] <VinnySauce> i'm using a GNOME extension to show AppIndicator icons in the system tray at the top right. I keep seeing a "blank" icon appear which takes up space that I can't click on. Is there a way to list the current AppIndicator notifications so I can see what it is that's doing it?
[23:34:56] <quantum_> Then, all my LAN machines go through a WireGuard server VM out to AzireVPN, but the problem is FlatHub will not accept VPNs.

[23:36:00] <quantum_> So I set up proxychains-ng on each client and set its config file to 127.0.0.1:8081 .

[23:37:57] <quantum_> The SOCKS5 destination is the router, which is directy on the internet.  So now, any app I do -not- want to go through the VPN:  $ proxychains plasma-discover
[23:38:07] <quantum_> Works beautifully.

[23:39:22] <moonshine> sounds fragile, tho

[23:39:57] <moonshine> when you have some connectivity issue, it's going to be a pita
[23:40:00] <quantum_> I'd used proxychains before it was packaged and had to compile, and it worked for years.
[23:40:45] <quantum_> I rarely have conn issues.

[23:42:46] <quantum_> So I'm on VPN all the time and appear to be in Switzerland ATM, yet for restrictive services that don't like VPNs I now have a solution.  For Discover I don't mind using my real IP.
