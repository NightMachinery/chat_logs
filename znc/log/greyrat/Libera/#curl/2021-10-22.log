[11:52:34] <icing> We are safe! We error on everything unexpected! Please tell us in detail why you need different!
[11:53:55] <bagder> in this case I don't even spot the unexpected detail though
[11:55:03] *** Joins: earnestly (~earnest@user/earnestly)
[11:55:11] <icing> maybe the status description has too many words?
[11:56:14] <bagder> whatever the reason is, the API for finding the problem is not ideal
[11:56:15] <icing> But my money would be on CONNECT having some special code branch to wriggle through.
[11:56:44] <bagder> could indeed be
[11:56:52] <bagder> we've had stuff like that in curl
[11:57:40] <icing> yeah, you need different IO handling after the response, I guess.
[11:58:05] <bagder> I think it's more specific, since lots of connect tests run fine
[11:58:23] <icing> CONNECT is a shortcut for a websocket... -.-
[12:00:26] <icing> Other 407 work? Or other CONNECT -> 200 work
[12:01:00] <bagder> yes other 407 tests and auth work as well as plain 200
[12:01:10] <bagder> which is why I suspect I did something wrong for this particular case
[12:01:17] <bagder> but the error message is not helping me
[12:01:38] <bagder> this error also seems to only happen in a PR of mine
[12:01:48] <bagder> so I probably broke it within the PR series
[12:02:15] <bagder> I might try to bisect a little
[12:03:43] <bagder> the error is not reproducing reliably
[12:04:54] <bagder> different topic:
[12:05:22] <bagder> amusing story: the git mailing list doesn't require you to be subscribed to post, instead they have (rather aggressive) spam triggering on content
[12:05:51] <bagder> one of the core people just posted, very annoyed after having had 6 attempts blocked
[12:06:22] <bagder> 'redacting a word I suspect to have triggered vger's filter: it is a word starting with "T" and continuing with "witch". Whenever you read "[itch]", that's what I substitued for the culprit'
[12:06:24] <icing> bagder: the "unexpected message" seems to be raised when their connection input buffer is not empty. Do you read the body of the 407? Maybe it lingers unconsumed somewhere.
[12:06:56] <bagder> that could then explain the timing dependency/differences
[12:07:09] * bagder checks code
[12:07:15] <icing> If this works, I demand being counted as comitter. =)
[12:13:21] <bagder> but yes, now I see that I get the error on the second CONNECT so it looks like you're right
[12:13:44] * icing wonders if this could be the day...
[12:23:09] <bagder> flaky errors are hard to verify as fixed
[12:23:23] <icing> "fixed often"

[13:45:00] <GodEater> weird one - if I'm invoking curl with -k, why would I get "error setting certificate verify locations" ?
[13:47:10] <bagder> I don't know...
[13:47:33] <bagder> what does it say exactly?
[13:47:35] <GodEater> I mean, the path in the error message doesn't exist - but I'm not sure why it would be trying to look at anything cert related
[13:48:33] <bagder> it does check, but should continue on errors if you use -k
[13:48:48] <GodEater> full curl invocation is "/path/to/static/curl -k https://url.to.file -f -o file_to_output
[13:49:24] <bagder> not sure *why* it checks though =)
[13:49:25] <GodEater> error is "curl: (77) error setting certificate verify locations:  CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt CApath: none"
[13:49:57] <GodEater> maybe the "-f" ?
[13:50:33] <GodEater> nope - fails without that too
[13:50:55] <bagder> and its not using a proxy?
[13:52:17] <GodEater> seems it might be
[13:52:26] <GodEater> I checked and there were environment variables set for proxy
[13:52:38] * GodEater face palms
[13:52:52] <GodEater> I'll have to check without someone else about this
[13:53:03] <bagder> try adding --proxy-insecure and see if it helps
[13:53:29] <GodEater> for now I've just removed the proxy environment variables entirely
[13:53:34] <GodEater> it's not needed as this is an internal url
[13:54:20] <GodEater> haha
[13:54:24] <GodEater> this gets better
[13:54:43] <GodEater> someone has set the https_proxy variable to have an https:// url in it, which I'm pretty sure is wrong for the host they specify
[13:55:01] <GodEater> running with --proxy-insecure then ends up with "wrong version number" back from SSL, which I think confirms it
[13:55:11] <bagder> sounds like it, yes
[13:56:32] <GodEater> I think I'm on the right track now though - so thank you!

[14:47:20] <Piru> actually loading and parsing the bundle is extremely slow process
[14:47:46] <GodEater> clearly we need actual figures on how much time it says. This is all hearsay and guesswork otherwise :D
[14:47:50] <GodEater> *saves
[14:48:05] <Piru> I ended up hacking openssl to check the bundle timestamp and cache the loaded bundle locally and reload only if the datestamp changes
[14:48:25] <Piru> that sped up establish tls connections markedly
[14:49:06] <Piru> mmm it checks paths + file timestamp now that I think about it
[14:50:26] <Piru> of course this time is insignificant with modern systems but we run on 15 year old powerpc hardware so... :-)
[14:55:55] <Piru> in a browser we even looked into replacing the libm with optimized one apple did years ago. we also spent some time profiling webkit and replacing most stupid use of sin/cos in some audio and colour related code with optimized fixed point code (it's not like the fpu is slow, but idiotic conversion of integer to float just to perform math and then convert back to int is just plain ...
[14:56:01] <Piru> ... stupid). the new code is something like 10x faster. it's amazing how much shitty code is used these days "because it doesn't matter"

[18:32:03] <bagder> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69679099/curl-with-username-password-authentication-failed
[18:32:08] <bagder> so many problems in a single question...
[18:42:58] <icing> what curl is this? powershell?
[18:47:43] <bagder> yes
[18:47:45] <bagder> at least partly
[18:48:23] <icing> curl could also output line and columns when something is wrong, you know?
[18:48:52] <bagder> and a useful suggestion on how to fix it
[18:49:27] <icing> you could call it 'powercurl', just a shell script to deliver on the side.
[18:53:09] * bagder got an email from an "openssl insider" about the quic situation...
[18:53:19] * icing thinks that not all his nudges are helpful ones.
[18:53:43] <bagder> "the internal discussion has not completely died"
[18:54:45] <bagder> very interesting
[18:55:08] <icing> I have not seen any positive feedback on their decision.
[18:55:41] <bagder> no, and it seems that might've been noticed

[20:04:22] <Shryder> Hello!
[20:04:59] <Shryder> Took me forever to figure out how to connect back into IRC lol, anyway, I wrote some code and I'm trying to make it as performant as possible. My only goal is to make HTTP requests as fast as possible using libcurl in C++. I would very appreciate it if you guys check it out and give me your thoughts: https://pastebin.com/raw/V5QpA8b7
[20:08:34] <Shryder> The way it basically works is by calling `WorkerType0::start_worker("https://example.com/api/game/", ".json", 0, 12000)` it starts up 192 amount of threads and splits the load, goal is to fetch from https://localhost/api/game/0.json all the way to https://localhost/api/game/12000.json, inside each thread I use the curl_easy interface. 
[20:10:07] <Shryder> Should I use the share interface in this case so hostname is resolved only once?

[21:06:05] <Piru> why so many threads? why not just use multi interface and a single thread?
[21:06:41] <Piru> I'd imagine you're mostly bound by the network I/O
