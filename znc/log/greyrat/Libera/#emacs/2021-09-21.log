[03:50:56] <bpalmer> Spawns_Carpeting: you could just invoke a shell script that immediately strips the filename and runs on the directory
[03:51:31] <Spawns_Carpeting> that seems pretty hacky honestly but I guess it could work
[03:52:07] <Spawns_Carpeting> i would like to see an api that inverts the flow of control, where you can write a function that tells flycheck where to display errors rather than the other way around
[03:53:04] <Spawns_Carpeting> as is, you pass an exe and some regex and flycheck decides what its doing, which greatly limits what you can do with it

[07:02:57] <twb> even when you run it in shitbird mode with copper cabling and "dumb" conncetors that don't modulate at all
[07:03:10] <libfud> when I moved into this house I had a tube run through my wall, then I installed cat6e cable to run from downstairs to upstairs
[07:03:17] <twb> 10GBASE-T is expensive compared to SFP+ tho
[07:03:28] <libfud> the tube also goes to the attic so later on I can make more runs around the other rooms
[07:03:36] <twb> like about 4 times more expensive
[07:05:07] <twb> I also like that supermicro BMCs now ship with per-device default password due to .ca.us law
[07:05:12] <libfud> I'll also have to get a 230V outlet installed in my garage
[07:05:24] <twb> And the BMCs now ONLY need a GUI browser, so they work over SOCKS5

[07:06:41] <twb> All western europe runs a common grid
[07:07:04] <twb> Kosovo's plant was lagging so far behind, it nearly caused all the western europe grid to scram
[07:07:51] <libfud> you mean the reactors on the grid?
[07:07:59] <twb> libfud: the whole grid
[07:08:01] <libfud> or does scram have a more general  meaning outside of nuclear power that I wasn't aware of
[07:08:04] <twb> libfud: no power for anyone
[07:08:34] <libfud> in naval nuclear parlance, scramming is a rapid and complete insertion of all control rods into the reactor
[07:09:06] <libfud> and I suppose for commercial nuclear power it's the complete withdrawal of all fuel rods
[07:09:06] <twb> libfud: I meant in the general sense of "automatic emergency shutdown"
[07:09:52] <libfud> I see. I wasn't aware that it was a general electric grid thing. But yeah, desynchronization of frequency/phase is very bad

[15:28:50] <aidalgol> It does?
[15:30:13] <bpalmer> I don't think many people would look at a common logo program and exclaim, 'This is a lisp!'
[15:31:10] <bpalmer> it does show up in more complicated programs, sure, or if you're really scrutinizing the output.
[15:32:00] <bpalmer> or, hmm, maybe that's just me.
[15:32:06] <susam> It is a dialect of Lisp indeed. Sometimes there is an overlap in terms too, e.g., PLIST.
[15:32:58] <susam> Also, I was once talking to an LCSI developer who worked on developing Atari Logo, IBM PC Logo, etc. The initial versions of Logo were all developed on Lisp machines with Lisp-based assemblers and debuggers. The actual Logo program was written in asm.
[15:33:37] <susam> He also mentioned that LogoWriter was inspired by Emacs (concepts of buffers for example). And that happened most LCSI developers were Emacs users themselves.
[15:35:42] <codingquark> Hello! When I do project-find-file (defined in project.el (built-in)), it just sits there. If I spam C-g, control comes back. This does not happen for all projects. And for the project where it is _not_ working right now, it was working before. The change is that I have made lots of changes
[15:35:53] <codingquark> Now, how do I go about debugging where it is getting stuck?

[18:04:14] <krux02> but I still have some questions regarding the clipboard.
[18:04:42] <krux02> I would like that emacs is also my clipboard manager, so that when I copy multiple things, I can then paste multiple things within emacs
[18:05:12] <judybot> codingquark: ? I was a fan of the show, but I didn’t know who the people were. I didn’t know who they were. I didn’t know who they were. I didn’t know who they were.

[18:05:47] <codingquark> Not knowing who they were has been one of the biggest traumas of this bot's life it seems
[18:06:06] <krux02> foomar, do you know how I can set emacs to be my clipboard manager?
[18:06:23] <foomar> krux02: You mean copying from X windows multiple times and then yanking in Emacs or viceversa?
[18:06:24] <krux02> so that emacs knows about all my copies from other programs?

[18:09:26] *** Joins: abcdw (~user@user/abcdw)
[18:10:12] <krux02> if I copy something from another window, it emacs doesn't know it yet.
[18:10:23] <foomar> krux02: I've just tried copying from firefox twice and only the last entry was in the kill-ring
[18:11:00] <krux02> If I then go to an emacs buffer and do popup-kill-ring, the entry is not there yet
[18:11:24] <foomar> krux02: I think it only puts the entry in the kill-ring once you yank it
[18:11:36] <krux02> but if I just yank, emacs realizes that I want to copy that stuff that compes from that other application and only then it is placed in the kill ring
[18:11:46] <krux02> so it other words it is placed in the kill ring on insertion
[18:11:56] <foomar> krux02: yes
[18:12:06] *** Joins: fftw (~va@horizonless-sophistry.volia.net)
[18:13:23] <krux02> the way copy paste works normally under linux, copy doesn't actually copy anything it just tells the program, rember the current selection someone wants to paste it later. Then on insertion the two programs connect and the "copy" is transferred.
[18:13:43] <krux02> therefore "copy, close application, insert" doesn't work
[18:13:52] <krux02> unless you have a clipboard manager
[18:14:05] <foomar> krux02: So the only purpose of the clipboard manager is to remember all of the contents of the primary selection
[18:14:13] <foomar> krux02: (I've never used one)
[18:14:17] <krux02> then the copy is transferred to the clipboard manager, and I am looking forward to make emacs my clipboard manager

[19:49:29] <andreyorst> I'm not seing a way to create child frame in this doc though

[22:39:47] <Rogach> Hi! It's me again with the lexical binding. Is there a way to force lexical binding to work globally? As of now I found how to enable the lexical binding from inside the library file, but can that be done from outside?
[22:40:01] <bpalmer> Rogach: no.
[22:40:47] <bpalmer> Rogach: well, I suppose you could (read) the file and then use EVAL with the LEXICAL parameter

[22:42:52] <Rogach> Why the loop?
[22:43:29] <bpalmer> a library file is a sequence of (form1 ...) (form2 ...)    ; read with that as the input stream first returns (form1 ...) , then returns (form2 ...) etc

[22:49:49] <akater[m]> What's the problem with `-*- lexical-binding: t -*-` on the top line?  That's what is recommended.
[22:53:13] <wasamasa> won't work in xemacs, lol
[22:53:14] <bpalmer> there's no problem as long as the code is written with it in mind.
[22:55:04] <krux02> Is it true that all local variables declared with ``let`` (and let* ...) won't be placed on the dynamic stack, in other words they won't shadow even if the code that does the lookup dynamic scoping is expected?
[22:56:01] <johnjay> when you're asking how the emacs interpreter itself works, you're asking the right questions
[22:56:10] <bpalmer> krux02: no; if the variable is declared with defvar, let on the variable works like it traditionally does.
[22:56:37] <krux02> well, defvar puts the variables in global scope, doesn't it?
[22:57:02] <bpalmer> krux02: oh, if you mean variables declared locally with no global defvar, then yeah, you're right. I used to think (declare (special ...)) would work, but testing showed otherwise.
[22:57:39] <krux02> (let and let* are just valid in a scope, where variables declared with defvar don't live in any scope they just exist until the dawn of time (emacs crash)
[22:57:48] <johnjay> bpalmer: it feels to me like because code incorporates a lot of implicit knowledge, that newer build systems should be used for newer code. and autotools should be intentionally just work for older code and optimized for it
[22:57:54] <johnjay> then all the implicit knowledge is maximized
[22:58:27] <krux02> is there an inverse to lexical-let?
[22:59:09] <krux02> for example `dynamic-let'that lets me use dynamic scoping when I need it once?
[22:59:09] <bpalmer> No.
[22:59:21] <wasamasa> just declare the dynamic variables with defvar, lol
[22:59:36] <krux02> then it's not dynamic at all anymore

[22:59:45] <bpalmer> Well, hmm, you might be able to do something like with (letf (symbol-function f) ...)
[22:59:50] <krux02> it doesn't shadow anything

[23:54:48] <rpav> when you say "int i", there's a space made in memory that `i` means
[23:55:27] <rpav> i.e. you can't make a variable that's a language-level binding and takes no actual memory (though in C++, you kinda can now)
