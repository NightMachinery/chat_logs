[00:01:03] <Brekkjern> One of my few contributions to open source code has been one single line to some documentation because it took me a while to figure out and the documentation sucked
[00:01:16] <Brekkjern> Other than that, I have no other contributions to that project.
[00:02:12] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: i‚Äôm complaining about people who make 50 comments pointing out every instance of the same issue over and over again on a PR
[00:02:34] <Brekkjern> Sure, that is annoying

[00:03:17] <riv> ^^ ughhhhhhh
[00:03:27] <riv> it's literally easier to just fix them
[00:04:36] <ngoldbaum> github PRs are basically a social engine for people (likely strangers) to get annoyed with each other
[00:05:46] <companion_cube> riv: commits are source code NFTs ü§î
[00:05:59] <riv> that's signed commits :P
[00:06:23] <companion_cube> whad kind of pleb doesn't sign their commits ;)

[00:20:41] <riv> i love these

[00:22:05] <jjuran> I'm tempted to make a JS-animated badge that randomly flies round the page, which says "Best viewed without JavaScript"
[00:22:30] <Brekkjern> Is it though?
[00:22:49] <jjuran> Since the badge would then be stationary, yes
[00:22:57] <cot> heh
[00:23:19] <cot> Is it possible to make a dom element move about in that manner though?
[00:23:33] <cot> thought that might only be possible with a canvas or such
[00:23:47] <skyl4rk> image position absolute or somesuch maybe
[00:23:51] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[00:23:53] <jjuran> Oh, not at all.  `position: absolute`
[00:24:01] <riv> 3 spaces???
[00:24:11] * jjuran <‚Äî¬†slowpoke
[00:24:53] <jjuran> That's a little too narrow for my taste
[00:24:56] <skyl4rk> 4 spaces, as in a tab, and 4 backspaces
[00:25:03] <jjuran> I prefer 3.28 spaces
[00:26:33] <skyl4rk> \x09\x08\x08\x08\x08
[00:26:39] <jjuran> `position: relative` would work even better
[00:27:25] <cot> The "3 spaces" is sarcasm, duh
[00:27:30] <cot> Though
[00:27:43] <cot> I've heard that it's the default indent config for emac's lua mode
[00:28:02] <cot> at least, that's what I was told in #lua
[00:32:21] <companion_cube> I've seen some C code with 3 spaces
[00:32:23] <companion_cube> wasn't that bad
[00:34:14] <skyl4rk> 2 spaces indent, language that uses begin/end, an editor that is not able to do the equivalent of brace matching on those begin/end - but instead hilights all the other positions where you have begin or end, whichever you placed your cursor on
[00:34:18] <skyl4rk> sigh
[00:39:22] <cot> which editor is that? vim can do it the do/end matching just fine with the lua plugin
[00:41:38] <skyl4rk> eclipse
[00:41:46] <skyl4rk> with some extra stuff on it
[00:41:50] <cot> oh. huh.
[00:43:24] <skyl4rk> might exist some plugin for eclipse that can do it too, but I'm not familiar with the eclipse marketplace mechanics, and can probably not reach it anyway

[02:36:34] <dminkovsky> he telescope must be kept very cold in order to observe in the infrared without interference, so it will be deployed in space near the Sun‚ÄìEarth L2 Lagrange point,
[02:38:51] <dminkovsky> The JWST will operate near the Earth‚ÄìSun L2 (Lagrange point), approximately 1,500,000 km (930,000 mi) beyond Earth's orbit. By way of comparison, Hubble orbits 550 km (340 mi) above Earth's surface, and the Moon is roughly 400,000 km (250,000 mi) from Earth.
[02:39:19] <dminkovsky> all so that it doesn't radiate and obstruct its own capabilities
[02:39:27] <dminkovsky> that's so beautiful

[04:46:16] <gwozniak> I know I've heard her stuff at some point, I just didn't know it was hers.  The only song I have heard that I know is hers is Shake It Off (which is very catchy)

[06:17:46] <defect> taylor swift from when though? she's changed her music a bit over the years
[06:19:46] <manicennui> Not all pop music was good in the 80s, but we had Michael Jackson, Prince, A-ha, Queen, Cyndi Lauper, U2...
[06:19:56] <manicennui> Now it's all over produced tween bullshit.
[06:19:58] <manicennui> None of it is good.

[06:34:35] <jjuran> Pat Benetar rocked.
[06:34:45] <jjuran> *Benatar
[06:34:47] <dminkovsky> i think TS just points to her stacked chips and whispers "scoreboard, look at the scoreboard"
[06:34:57] <dminkovsky> while counting her money
[06:35:10] <manicennui> I never claimed that she wasn't successful.
[06:35:31] <manicennui> If you want to use that as the measurement you are going to be really disappointed though.
[06:35:39] <manicennui> Because some much shittier artists have done better.
[06:35:59] <gwozniak> I'm into Pat Benatar as much as I am Taylor Swift (so, not at all)
[06:37:41] <dminkovsky> whats your music gwozniak
[06:38:20] <manicennui> They don't have music in Canada.
[06:38:42] <dminkovsky> is the toronto area even canada? they play baseball for crying out loud
[06:39:03] <gwozniak> Usually offbeat stuff: some 80s heavy/thrash metal, electronic stuff, jazz, bizarre stuff that is not all that easy to listen to
[06:39:18] <dminkovsky> cool
[06:39:21] <gwozniak> I tend to avoid anything that has vocals
[06:39:29] <dminkovsky> don't like vocals?
[06:39:34] <imode> animals as leaders up your alley?
[06:40:18] <gwozniak> Not generally, no.  I'm not all that into the human voice as an instrument
[06:40:27] <gwozniak> There are exceptions, of course
[06:40:28] <manicennui> I wonder whether a song without vocals has ever hit number one.
[06:40:41] <defect> i avoid vocals when trying to read stuff. i get distracted
[06:40:53] <defect> vocals in a language i don't understand works

[06:42:23] <dminkovsky> i can die and never hear that again
[06:42:31] <manicennui> But they aren't at the top of my list.
[06:42:41] <gwozniak> I listened to a Led Zeppelin album not long ago and was bored out my mind

[06:45:45] <imode> news at 11.
[06:47:02] <manicennui> The balance of artistry and commercialism has been a problem in the music industry for a long time, but in the last few decades the commercialism has won handily.
[06:47:10] <dminkovsky> i'd listen to AAL but i'm like defect except i can't work and listen to music at all
[06:47:19] <imode> give the link I pasted a shot.
[06:47:24] <imode> you'll be surprised.
[06:47:33] <manicennui> There is still great stuff out there, but it rarely hits the peaks that music from the late 60s did.
[06:48:03] <imode> I'll agree that there's a heavy amount of commercialization, but the 80's brought us a lot of wonderful things.
[06:48:10] <imode> same with the 90's, same with the 00's.
[06:48:21] <imode> same with the 10's. I can't believe I can say that now..
[06:48:54] <imode> as with anything I think it's more of a case by case basis, some artists get reeeeally lazy/caught in a loop.

[06:53:24] <gwozniak> imode: not heard of AAL before. Will have to check them out now
[06:53:41] <gwozniak> They remind me of John Scofield, but more distorted
[06:53:52] <dminkovsky> yeah i can't listen to anything like this and work
[06:53:57] <manicennui> It reminds of me the Doom soundtrack, but lighter and more progressive.
[06:53:58] <dminkovsky> my mind just wants to listen

[06:54:20] <imode> their first and third album really fucking jam.
[06:54:35] <imode> like, you can listen through and not be bored.
[06:54:36] <gwozniak> Apologies for the Christmas music, but this is the kind of thing I heard a lot when growing up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQiZ5SmGJYg
[06:54:36] <buttsbot> Deck Them Halls - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQiZ5SmGJYg
[06:54:37] <manicennui> The Doom soundtrack is better than most metal/industrial albums.
[06:55:08] <gwozniak> The Doom soundtrack is basically the same as most metal albums of the time :)
[06:55:23] <gwozniak> It really tried to do Metallica in a video game
[06:55:42] <manicennui> I wish most metal sounded like early Metallica.
[06:56:09] <manicennui> Frankly, most metal bands are really good at... I don't even know how to describe it. At some point it seems like they think that just banging on their instruments sounds good.
[06:56:28] <gwozniak> Most of it is really terrible
[06:56:33] <manicennui> s/good at/bad at/
[06:56:49] <manicennui> I feel like Mick Gordon has a far better command of whatever that thing is.
[06:56:52] <manicennui> Harmony?
[06:57:27] <gwozniak> imode: listening to a bit more AAL and it is totally "heavy jazz"
[06:57:40] <manicennui> I get that dissonance can be a good thing in music, but not all dissonance is good.
[06:57:54] <gwozniak> It has to be used sparingly, imo
[06:58:37] <imode> The genre is canonically referred to as djent.
[06:59:06] <gwozniak> TIL!
[06:59:15] <manicennui> gwozniak: That video is unavailable in freedumb land.
[06:59:55] <gwozniak> I will sometimes just buy a whole artist's discography on Bandcamp
[07:00:15] <manicennui> YT really only wants me to listen to Deck The Halls.
[07:00:20] <gwozniak> I have no idea if I will like most it
[07:00:51] <gwozniak> manicennui: wait... the US doesn't have access to something? wild
[07:00:59] <manicennui> That particular video.
[07:01:03] <manicennui> What is the name of the band?
[07:01:05] <gwozniak> Anyway, it's Ira Ironstrings
[07:01:48] <gwozniak> Big band Christmas stuff.  Album is "Christmas Classics" if you care to find it (you probably don't)
[07:01:51] <manicennui> Ah, it is like Deck The Halls with more swing or something.

[07:02:52] <manicennui> =P
[07:02:58] <gwozniak> My grandfather was a big band leader and everyone in the family was a musician
[07:03:11] <manicennui> I wish people in my family were... anything.
[07:03:19] <manicennui> But especially musicians or artists.
[07:04:16] <imode> either xonotic fixed the movement bugs or my network is no longer shit.
[07:04:19] <imode> either way I'm a happy clam.
[07:04:36] <imode> instagib with grappling hooks is a sport.

[07:06:58] <manicennui> Great song with a really great intro.
[07:07:00] <manicennui> Wow.
[07:07:15] <manicennui> gwozniak: Most of my family is in the suburbs here.
[07:07:19] <manicennui> I just can't stand them.
[07:07:35] <gwozniak> The other half of my family, well, I don't visit
[07:16:12] <manicennui> After my mother's parents died I cut contact with the rest of her family. They are racist suburbanites who are super selfish and vindictive.

[07:21:16] <gwozniak> These are the people I don't visit
[07:22:05] <manicennui> I think the older generations are losing their minds now that younger people feel less obligation to stay connected to people out of a sense of obligation.

[07:48:38] <bkero> war, colonization, and proselytizing
[07:49:01] <manicennui> Lot of non-Christians in Asia though.
[07:49:04] <manicennui> And the Middle East.
[07:49:32] <manicennui> I guess they did colonize parts of Asia too.
[07:52:15] <bkero> Uhh, lots.

[08:33:21] <imode> I have an interesting problem that I've come across organically.
[08:34:10] <companion_cube> congrats, when's the wedding?
[08:34:19] <imode> LOL.
[08:34:25] <imode> fuck yuou lmao that got me good.
[08:34:39] <companion_cube> just like she did, heh? ;) ;)
[08:35:31] <indigo> Hahha nice one companion_cube
[08:36:41] <imode> this is related to the tuple spaces discussion I started, and I imagined that you could compress the space that the tuple store used without additional overhead by using a trie (love that structure). but if you were to submit a pattern to the tuple space, you'd either need to enumerate each of the tuples and test it (doing a DFS through the trie to filled-in nodes), or you'd need to do some
[08:36:43] <imode> form of backtracking.
[08:37:29] <companion_cube> tries are cool to speed up pattern matching, yes :p
[08:37:44] <imode> well, it doesn't speed up pattern matching on patterns who's languages are regular.
[08:37:50] <imode> it works fine for static patterns or prefixes.
[08:38:25] <companion_cube> hmm it does accelerate matching one pattern against many objects
[08:38:42] <companion_cube> crude versions of that are sometimes used in prologs
[08:38:48] <companion_cube> less crude versions, in theorem provers :)
[08:39:08] <imode> assume that your tuples are paths through a trie. how would you match something akin to `(math, ?, 1, ?)`
[08:39:30] <imode> where the general form is something like `(math, <op>, <lhs>, <rhs>)`
[08:39:35] <companion_cube> well, follow `math`
[08:39:39] <companion_cube> then follow each subtrie
[08:39:44] <companion_cube> then follow 1
[08:39:49] <companion_cube> then yield each subtrie :)
[08:40:14] <companion_cube> faster than iterating through a list of tuples
[08:40:24] <companion_cube> you can even build a substitution as you go
[08:40:33] <companion_cube> (by "follow each" I of course mean backtracking)
[08:40:36] <imode> right, there's some form of recursion and backtracking present there, because if at some point you meet something that doesn't match, you need to walk back and try an earlier branch.
[08:40:38] <indigo> I'd try an inverted index
[08:40:56] <imode> because ? says "I don't care", you can try them in some order so long as you don't retrace the previous branches.
[08:41:07] <companion_cube> yeah, just backtracking
[08:41:21] <companion_cube> if you're interested in this sort of things, I have the perfect book for you
[08:41:23] <imode> how could you do it without backtracking, and what does that say about the class of automaton required.
[08:41:49] <imode> indigo: tuples aren't guaranteed to be of a single shape.
[08:41:57] <imode> plus the idea is to save on space and time.
[08:42:00] <companion_cube> imode: https://vrac.cedeela.fr/handbook_term_indexing.ps
[08:42:02] <companion_cube> enjoy
[08:42:15] <imode> huh, I already have that saved.
[08:42:30] <companion_cube> there's a section about automata iirc, but it works only one way (when it contains patterns, not terms to match)
[08:42:36] <companion_cube> heh
[08:42:45] <companion_cube> that's basically sota from 10 years ago
[08:42:48] <imode> so that's the problem, effectively. doing it without backtracking.
[08:42:57] <imode> or at least pinning down the minimum requirements.
[08:42:58] <companion_cube> backtracking is still worth it
[08:43:14] <imode> if you externalize it into backwards pointers, yes.
[08:43:17] <indigo> I wonder if each level of tuple can be its own inverted index
[08:43:20] <companion_cube> no, just use a stack
[08:43:28] <imode> why would I want to use a stack.
[08:43:31] <companion_cube> indigo: there's something like that too, but it's not that good
[08:43:35] <imode> stack overflow, baybee.
[08:43:39] <companion_cube> imode: to hold the backtracking state?!
[08:43:42] <companion_cube> no, no overflow
[08:43:44] <companion_cube> a stack is
[08:43:46] <companion_cube> just a vector
[08:43:58] <companion_cube> I mean, people implement this shit in C and C++ super efficiently
[08:44:03] <companion_cube> and it works very well
[08:44:14] <imode> that's not my point. you've now introduced program state that expands linearly to your path length.
[08:44:16] <companion_cube> (as in, they win the competition each year for the last 10 years)
[08:44:22] <companion_cube> path length = 4
[08:44:25] <companion_cube> I think that's fine ;)
[08:44:36] <companion_cube> (ok, you need more than that. but still.)
[08:44:45] <imode> assume you trust me as an engineer and aren't trying to 1-up me.
[08:44:50] <companion_cube> :D
[08:44:56] <companion_cube> yeah but really, why not a stack
[08:45:00] <companion_cube> like, prolog has stacks everywhere
[08:45:13] <imode> I just said so. you've introduced program state that expands with respect to your path length.
[08:45:34] <imode> some shithead implements that without thinking and it leads to a vulnerability. and yes I am nitpicky because this has security concerns.
[08:45:49] <imode> the problem isn't trivial.
[08:45:59] <imode> or maybe it is, but I know it's not "reach for backtracking search" trivial.
[08:46:43] <companion_cube> That's the most efficient use of a trie though?
[08:47:15] <companion_cube> Are you looking to establish a standard? Or implement yourself?
[08:47:24] <imode> working on a standard.
[08:47:45] <companion_cube> Oh I see.
[08:48:00] <companion_cube> But get an implementation first, right? :)
[08:48:06] <imode> you could enforce the idea of parent pointers. that way you'd up the cost per node but it'd at least be constant when you load the thing in and start modifying it.
[08:48:09] <imode> mhm.
[08:48:38] <imode> I _feel_ like you can do better, though, by not introducing any new data.
[08:49:07] <imode> like there are a few considerations in each pattern that you can break down. like you're processing part of a pattern and say "well in this span of a pattern, this constraint is established"
[08:49:28] <imode> i.e for some tuple (... foo ? bar ...), you can naively look ahead of any of the selected branches.
[08:49:38] <imode> to see whether `bar` is a child of those branches.
[08:50:17] <imode> that breaks down when you have sequential wildcards, though.
[08:51:08] <imode> (... foo ? ? ? bar ...) <-- "skipping ahead" to look 3 levels deep may work if you can represent the trie in level order.
[08:51:22] <companion_cube> seems to me like parent pointers are a lot more tricky than backtracking
[08:51:50] <companion_cube> yeah just look "discrimination trees" in the book
[08:51:55] <companion_cube> for nested terms
[08:52:10] <companion_cube> anyway, no one I know uses parent pointers to search through the trie
[08:52:33] <companion_cube> (they're also harder to maintain but well)
[08:52:39] <imode> because you usually use a trie to search for fixed patterns.
[08:52:43] <imode> not ones containing wildcards.

[08:52:53] <buttsbot> 2016 - Mannheim Steamroller - Deck The Halls - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBMwaczhjkM
[08:52:54] <companion_cube> not with discrimination trees
[08:52:54] <imode> used for existence and completion testing.
[08:53:04] <jjuran> With synchronized lights!
[08:53:23] <imode> looking at 'em now.
[08:53:40] <imode> evince does _not_ like postscript..
[08:53:44] <companion_cube> hu
[08:54:00] <companion_cube> works well for me :/
[08:55:48] * indigo inverts imode's indexes
[08:55:49] <imode> the p-strings _look_ like the pattern but the idea's been inverted. you're encoding patterns.
[08:55:56] <imode> vs. encoding data to be matched against.
[08:56:17] <imode> like, I want to be able to actually fill in those wildcards instead of doing structural matching. I need to hand you back something.
[08:59:13] <imode> this instead says "here's a discrimination tree, throw an actual tree at it and see whether it recognizes it".
[08:59:41] <companion_cube> it works both ways
[08:59:45] <imode> does it?
[08:59:53] <companion_cube> you can have a tree of terms and look for those matcing a pattern
[09:00:01] <companion_cube> or a tree of patterns and find which match a term
[09:00:29] <companion_cube> you can even look for terms that unify, but then there's better than discrimination trees
[09:00:48] <imode> the inverse would basically be what I'm suggesting.
[09:01:05] <imode> I hand you a p-string, you find me the paths that satisfy it.
[09:01:13] <imode> but that still implies some form of backtracking, no?
[09:01:22] <imode> the illustration seems to say as much.
[09:01:45] <companion_cube> yeah of course
[09:01:52] <companion_cube> can't escape the backtracking
[09:02:10] <imode> I feel like you could with a different representation. I feel like I was on to something earlier.
[09:02:20] <imode> w.r.t level order representation and lookaheads.
[09:02:33] <companion_cube> "lookahead" sure sounds like a form of backtracking to me :)
[09:02:47] <imode> you don't go back, though.
[09:03:45] <companion_cube> you go ahead and then back?
[09:05:35] <imode> "I have a span of N wild cards, go level by level, grabbing whatever random node that's connected to the node that's selected prior to the first wildcard, and when you're done, search the current level for the entry after the last wildcard".
[09:06:07] <imode> you don't go back, you just keep going forward. you don't need to select another entry, because if you make it to the end of the trie, you either have an arity mismatch or a tuple fitting that description can't exist.
[09:06:58] <companion_cube> sometimes you do have to
[09:07:02] <companion_cube> you might follow a dead end branch
[09:07:27] <companion_cube> although sounds like you're doing a kind of BFS
[09:07:27] *** Quits: sudoforge (~sudoforge@wireguard/tunneler/sudoforge) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[09:07:29] <imode> (foo ? ? ? bar), for example, would have you accumulating whatever random path that's still got `foo` in it at the head, and then seeing whether the level 3 levels down connects to that path.
[09:07:43] <companion_cube> but "grabbing whatever random node" there's going to be several of them no?
[09:07:52] <companion_cube> like, you need storage for the BFS too
[09:07:55] <imode> we don't care which one that is, though, so long as you can form a path.
[09:08:06] <imode> well, not if you store the trie in level order.
[09:08:14] <imode> which you _can_ do.
[09:08:20] <imode> it just makes other traversals harder.
[09:08:30] <companion_cube> each node of a level connected to the next one of the same level?
[09:08:38] <companion_cube> but then it's hard to stop once you exit the right subtrie
[09:08:41] <companion_cube> the one below "foo"
[09:08:51] <imode> damn I wish IRC supported whiteboards.
[09:09:10] <imode> so let's say I store the trie in level order with just like, some stupid delimiter.
[09:09:28] <imode> or an array of nodes with all the traditional structural pointers, just arranged in level order.
[09:09:46] <imode> your array would be segmented by [level_1][level_2][level_3], etc.
[09:09:56] <companion_cube> imagine you're looking for `(f a ? c)` in `(f a b0 d)`, `(f a b c)`
[09:10:08] <companion_cube> you need to follow the first branch through b0
[09:10:12] <companion_cube> (wildcard)
[09:10:22] <imode> mhm, so the representation of that would be [f][a][b, b0][c, d]
[09:10:26] <companion_cube> but then you still have to backtrack because you find `d` and not `c`
[09:10:28] <imode> in level order.
[09:10:46] <companion_cube> should have used b1 and not b, ugh
[09:10:51] <companion_cube> my point is that it comes afterwards
[09:10:59] <companion_cube> level order loses information!
[09:11:17] <imode> not if you persist that as whole nodes, so the connectivity is preserved.
[09:11:24] <companion_cube> like, when to stop when you exit the f terms, and start the g terms
[09:12:48] <imode> `(f a ? c)` would mean going to the first level, grabbing `f`, going to the next level, grabbing whatever's connected to `f` (so an inverse pointer), going to the next level, grabbing whatever's connected to `a` (you have any choice here), and then grabbing `c` and _asserting_ that it's connected to whatever you grabbed before.
[09:13:03] <imode> so you always point towards the root rather than the leaves.
[09:13:16] <imode> you still need to store the resulting tuple, but you need to do that anyway.
[09:13:37] <companion_cube> I guess I'd need to see the trie, indeed
[09:13:53] <imode> though you're making the assumption (probably a very wrong one) that your trie is deeper than it is wide.
[09:14:14] <companion_cube> ah, not necessarily
[09:14:19] <imode> well, in terms of tradeoff.
[09:14:26] <imode> if your trie is wide your levels are wide.
[09:14:46] <imode> so unless you store your whole array as an array of _levels_, each of which has a sub-array of nodes..
[09:15:00] <imode> or otherwise encode length information to the levels (which is hard to maintain dynamically).
[09:15:04] <imode> you'll be suffering.
[09:15:21] <imode> this also has to support fast insertions and deletions.
[09:15:23] <companion_cube> sounds like you should leave that out of the standard and at the will of implementors :)
[09:15:28] <imode> heh.
[09:15:39] <imode> yeah, but it helps to see if you _can_ standardize it.
[09:16:01] <imode> and if it makes way too many assumptions, leave it out. always worth exploring an idea until you hit an absolute wall.
[09:16:03] <companion_cube> if I had to do it I'd certainly try the classic way ;)
[09:16:09] <imode> mhm, most people would.
[09:16:34] <companion_cube> ofc it's really designed for terms, not just flat tuples
[09:16:53] <companion_cube> that said, gn
[09:16:59] <imode> I really have to think on that level representation, maybe there is a speedup there.
[09:17:01] <imode> cheers.
[09:18:25] <imode> yeah at each level you say "query for some value X (or if it's a wildcard, give me literally anything) such that the node labeled by X is connected to some node Y in the previous layer of the trie".
[09:18:34] <imode> and if that query fails you don't have a match.
[09:18:58] <imode> but with the wildcard you... basically a linear search through each level.
[09:20:36] <imode> because you'd have to test whether the node you've selected has a pointer to the node you've previously selected in the previous level. so with a phat trie (which I imagine you'll have, tries with small strings will be fat) you're losing in speed, but with a thin one, you're gaining.
[09:21:58] <imode> it's also a little more expensive because you're maintaining a separate view of your tree.
[09:22:05] <imode> meh. to my notes this goes.
[09:25:29] <imode> the parent pointer approach was attractive for platforms with really tiny stacks.
[09:50:07] <manicennui> I suddenly remembered this cool lamp my grandmother had...
[09:50:34] <manicennui> It was similar to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSMqSnsU4TA
[09:50:34] <buttsbot> Creator's Inc 3 Goddess Rain Lamp (Oil Motion) Beautiful! - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSMqSnsU4TA
[09:51:38] <imode> oh that is trippy. is that oil following a spout?
[09:51:50] <manicennui> It is mineral oil on a wire.
[09:51:50] <imode> or is that actual water.
[09:51:55] <imode> yeahhhh I figured.
[09:51:57] <imode> it looks neat.
[09:52:04] <jjuran> Lamps tend to be warm or hot, and lava is really really hot, but lava lamps are cool.
[09:52:50] <imode> wonder how hard it'd be to build one.
[09:54:00] <manicennui> Most of the videos on YT seem to be the same few designs that are kind of greco roman.
[09:54:07] <manicennui> I imagine that someone could design something much cooler.
[09:55:09] <imode> I wonder what'd happen if you, say, used EL wire.
[09:55:19] <imode> that'd be neat.
[09:56:18] <gerikson> 02:56 <coyotes4ys> anybody know of bona fide bad changes in the linux kernel that have happened because the microsoft cronies are pouring code into it?
[09:56:28] <gerikson> never change, fossbros

[18:17:18] <gerikson> yeah not gonna find that solution by myself
[18:17:25] <Brekkjern> Me neither :P
[18:20:02] <gerikson> ``As an indie software maker it frustrates me when I have to pay 50$ dollars to have a decent cloud server setup to run my apps.''
[18:21:25] <gerikson> I dunno, that sounds pretty cheap actually
[18:23:35] <Brekkjern> I mean, it's a bit of both?
[18:24:09] <Brekkjern> Like, it's cheap for a dedicated system for your app, but if I didn't expect to have a loadbalancer for myself with a private IP and such...
[18:24:31] <Brekkjern> Like, why isn't there a cheapo tier shared LB for example?
[18:25:34] <gerikson> duno
[18:25:44] <gerikson> this was a HN comment about Cloudflare FULL STACK
[18:27:19] <Brekkjern> Like, I have a VPS with shared memory. It's cheap AF, and fairly powerful, but if I start using memory I might suffer performance loss. That's fine with me for my use case, but whenever you go into cloud tech everything is suddenly enterprise grade
[18:27:40] <Brekkjern> And I honestly couldn't really care less about having a 99.999% uptime on my IRC bouncer :P
[18:28:21] <defect> kinda unrelated, but i run irssi on digitalocean, and it's been ridiculously stable
[18:28:53] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but even DO is a bit expensive for the point I am making
[18:29:15] <defect> how much is your vm?
[18:29:17] <Brekkjern> I pay about $5 a month for 2vCPU and 4GB RAM. That is dirt cheap in this market.
[18:29:29] <gthm> the more I read of Scott Aaronson's blog the more I think he's just batshit insane
[18:29:31] <defect> that's what i pay, i think. let me double check
[18:30:11] <Brekkjern> It is probably what you pay, but you get 1vCPU and 1GB RAM.
[18:32:05] <defect> yeah, you're right. 2 cpu and 4 gigs is nice for $5
[18:32:26] <gerikson> I have DO too, it's enough for my needs
[18:32:56] <Brekkjern> Humm. Maybe I should upgrade my VPS. The provider I use is offering 4vCPU and 6GB RAM for $7 now...
[18:33:12] <gerikson> gthm: I think he knows what he's talking about re: technical stuff, but somehow he got on the wrong side of a twitter mob and was radicalized
[18:33:29] <gerikson> ``Ask HN: Is There a Mars Constitution?''
[18:33:32] <gerikson> ...
[18:33:56] <Brekkjern> I thought Mars was the libertarian dream because there are no governments there?
[18:35:46] <ngoldbaum> no governments
[18:36:01] <ngoldbaum> lots of radiation in the air and perchlorates in the soil though
[18:36:13] <gerikson> I'm gettnig really disillusioned with the frontier mentality of so much SF
[18:36:23] <Brekkjern> Just get air and water from a reputable seller and that shouldn't be a problem, ngoldbaum
[18:36:52] * ngoldbaum gives Brekkjern 3 dogecoin for a can of perriair
[18:37:51] * Brekkjern refuses ngoldbaums dogecoin and demands gold as the latency to the doge network back on Earth is so high that doge is pointless on Mars.
[18:38:03] <gerikson> lol
[18:38:24] <ngoldbaum> gold would be worthless on mars
[18:38:34] <ngoldbaum> a purely bean-based economy would develop
[18:39:58] <companion_cube> gerikson: did someone really ask that??
[18:40:16] <companion_cube> is it like "has Elon Musk become our actual space lord yet?"
[18:40:55] <gerikson> companion_cube: yes ,of course

[18:43:11] <companion_cube> even more so, I mean
[18:43:49] <gerikson> who was it who ridiculed colonizing mars by pointing out that no-one is colonizing the Gobi desert
[18:43:55] <gerikson> which is way nicer than Mars
[18:43:59] <gerikson> warmer
[18:44:00] <gerikson> closer
[18:44:02] <gerikson> more water
[18:44:08] <gerikson> more oxygen
[18:44:24] <companion_cube> or you know, the bottom of the ocean
[18:44:43] <companion_cube> I guess the argument is that in case of asteroid catastrophe, mars is safer than Gobi
[18:45:04] <ngoldbaum> the gobi desert already has a government
[18:45:16] <ngoldbaum> can‚Äôt declare yourself crypto-emperor
[18:46:02] <gerikson> mmm becasue if you;re on mars and starting behaving badly, there's no way anyone will interfere with your supply of vital medecines or machinery from Earth
[18:46:05] <gerikson> no way at all
[18:46:41] <Brekkjern> There is actually a place on earth that doesn't have a government at all
[18:46:46] <Brekkjern> You could go colonize there

[18:47:23] <gthm> gerikson: I think @pinboard has been doing that
[18:47:28] <Brekkjern> Neither Egypt or Sudan makes claim to the territory there, so you are free to colonize that area

[19:34:35] <manicennui> companion_cube: I honestly don't know what is going to happen with Trump. I'm done expecting people to do the right thing. We will certainly elect another Republican within the next decade though.
[19:34:43] <manicennui> We tend to switch back and forth.
[19:35:02] <manicennui> Because some idiots think that Republicans are somehow going to help them when Democrats fail to do so.
[19:36:15] <companion_cube> I've heard of a book named "dying of whiteness" whicih explains a bit that apparently
[19:36:22] <companion_cube> why people vote against their interest
[19:36:59] <manicennui> I think it is pretty simple, but no one wants to admit that most people are dumb.
[19:37:12] <manicennui> And think about things in some kind of team mentality.
[19:37:32] <manicennui> They can't imagine that the solution to Democrats failing to act is not "the other team".
[19:37:45] <riv> as long as the democrats dont run hillary again, trump wont win
[19:37:57] <manicennui> riv: I'm not counting on anything.
[19:38:34] <Brekkjern> I'm betting they will find the most uninspiring asshole to put on their poster for the next election :P
[19:38:39] <manicennui> People are already complaining that Biden has done nothing (let's ignore the limits of what POTUS can do for this discussion) even though he has signed multiple massive bills and overturned all kinds of shit in his first week.
[19:38:54] <riv> i want a president that does nothing, ideally he doesn't even exist
[19:39:24] <manicennui> He really doesn't have as much power as people think in the areas that people care about.
[19:39:31] <manicennui> He can't fix healthcare with an executive order.
[19:39:44] <manicennui> And he can't introduce legislation and force Congress to vote on it.
[19:40:37] <manicennui> Look at the problems he is having trying to get OSHA to enforce workplace vaccination.
[19:41:03] <manicennui> That is how executive orders can change things: through existing powers they already have and can convince courts to interpret in their favor.
[19:46:12] <manicennui> But believing that Republicans will fix healthcare is delusional.
[19:46:38] <manicennui> Or student loans, or housing, or anything other than lowering taxes.

[21:06:37] <Brekkjern> Yeah. That was what I figured

[22:36:58] <manicennui> Only going to be six episodes?
[22:37:05] <manicennui> And they are releasing it weekly.
[22:38:30] <indigo> I mean, they already killed off a major character who IIUC wasn't killed off in the books
[22:40:01] <manicennui> Sure, but the general story is similar.
[22:40:15] <manicennui> I assume they aren't going to cram 4-5 books into 6 episodes.
[22:40:20] <indigo> Ugh, the six episodes gives me a GoT S8 vibe
[22:40:27] <indigo> I hope they don't mess it up

[22:49:50] <gwozniak> I haven't seen any of it since it moved to Amazon.  I should probably work on getting it because my wife and I really liked the first 3(?) seasons
[22:51:15] <manicennui> I honestly liked the first three seasons far more than the Amazon seasons.
[22:51:21] <manicennui> But I seem to be the only one.
[22:51:54] <Brekkjern> Eh. I like them all, but I see where you are coming from

[22:52:21] <gwozniak> I have not read the books, if that matters
[22:52:28] <manicennui> gwozniak: Neither have I.
[22:53:05] <ngoldbaum> they‚Äôve ruled out more seasons but not e.g. movies i guess
[22:53:17] <ngoldbaum> i dunno books 7-9 would be hard on a TV show
[22:53:34] <manicennui> The third season expanded things so much, and then the fourth season focused on a very small situation that I found it hard to care about.
[22:53:52] <ngoldbaum> yeah book 4 is also my least favorite
[22:53:54] <manicennui> And didn't really satisfy my curiosity about what was discovered in season 3.
[22:54:11] <manicennui> s/found it/found/
[22:54:22] <ngoldbaum> my favorite so far is either book 5 or book 8
[22:54:58] <ngoldbaum> book 8 had some solid setpieces
[22:55:20] <Brekkjern> Isn't the fourth season that planet they spend all the time at?
[22:55:42] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Yeah, but it might as well be anywhere.
[22:56:05] <manicennui> And the alien tech was lackluster.
[22:56:35] <Brekkjern> Yeah, but that is also the weakest book in the series
[22:56:54] <manicennui> And now they seem to not care about the protomolecule other than as a political chip.
[22:57:18] <Brekkjern> That is pretty much how it is in the books as well
[22:57:50] * ngoldbaum waits patiently for book 9 to show up in two weeks
[22:58:22] <ngoldbaum> murtry is also the worst villain in the series
[23:01:41] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[23:01:51] <Brekkjern> I wish the source material was better htere
[23:02:44] <manicennui> I kind of feel like the first few seasons felt like we were learning about this universe and growing to love the characters, and then the fourth and fifth seasons are more standard sci-fi fare.
[23:03:14] <manicennui> It kind of lost that sense of wonder for me.
[23:03:24] <ngoldbaum> season 4 was when bezos bought it and the budget went up noticeably
[23:03:46] <ngoldbaum> maybe you‚Äôre noticing a need to rely on character moments instead of spending money on expensive sets or CG
[23:04:19] <manicennui> I think some of the most powerful moments are in the first few seasons though. There is a particular scene with Amos...

[23:04:53] <manicennui> That is exactly what I was thinking.
[23:05:00] <manicennui> Probably my favorite scene in the entire show.
[23:05:09] <manicennui> Amos is by far my favorite character.
[23:05:13] <ngoldbaum> my main gripe with season 3 is they had to cram all of book 3 into the second half
[23:05:22] <ngoldbaum> because they thought they were getting cancelled
[23:05:54] <manicennui> Whenever Amos reveals a bit about himself or his thinking, I really enjoy it.

[23:15:05] <buttsbot> Yoko Kanno + The Music of Cowboy Bebop | Netflix - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZINRNNNRNVE
[23:15:37] <manicennui> Looks like they rerecorded the same songs.
[23:15:46] <manicennui> I guess it could just be the theme song.
[23:16:59] <imode> I hope it's far more campy than I can imagine.
[23:17:39] <manicennui> She is the same composer who did the original soundtrack, so it should be good regardless.
[23:17:46] <manicennui> It being the music.
[23:18:52] <ngoldbaum> imode: it‚Äôs getting pretty mixed reviews :/
[23:18:57] <imode> it's out?!
[23:19:14] <ngoldbaum> to critics
[23:19:22] <ngoldbaum> https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/cowboy_bebop_2021
[23:19:22] <buttsbot> Cowboy Bebop - Rotten Tomatoes
[23:19:36] <imode> can't say I'm surprised.
[23:19:57] <imode> live action adaptations are so lazy.
[23:20:02] <ngoldbaum> lots of 1/10 and 9/10 reviews
[23:20:28] <imode> it's literally "let's streamline our content pipeline by not having to do any long-term complex work of any kind".
[23:20:41] <imode> animation is still difficult.
[23:21:09] <manicennui> The problem is that Americans expect all animation to be for children.
[23:21:23] <imode> I'm an American.
[23:21:36] <imode> there was a beautiful time when that wasn't the case.
[23:23:02] <manicennui> When was that?
[23:23:33] <imode> from the late 90's to the end of the 00's.
[23:32:47] <ngoldbaum> lol a scott aaronson blog post about ivermectin on HN with upvote count just barely higher comment count

[23:42:07] <imode> I mean.
[23:42:11] <imode> ML is hogwash anyway.
[23:43:23] <manicennui> Are you not enjoying the targeted ads?
[23:43:49] <imode> I see no ads.
[23:44:42] <manicennui> So that's a no.
[23:44:48] <manicennui> No wonder you have a negative opinion of ML!
[23:45:29] <gwozniak> I have to fight the push for using ML in the compiler a fair bit
[23:45:52] <gwozniak> Pretty sure it's an initiative by the sales team
[23:46:46] <ngoldbaum> what even does that mean
[23:47:21] <ngoldbaum> i guess it would only make sense to do that gwozniak if you integrated the compiler with blockchain technology
[23:47:52] <gwozniak> "Hey, what do you think about using machine learning/AI in the compiler?"  "I think it won't work."  "Yeah, but AI."
[23:48:18] <gwozniak> I did an analysis of this at one point.  It's a dumb idea.
[23:48:46] <gwozniak> And in the GNU tools track at the latest Linux conference, the GCC folks agreed
[23:48:56] <imode> all ML is a dumb fucking idea.
[23:49:31] <gwozniak> One of the key reasons it's a dumb idea is that tracking down bugs becomes basically impossible
[23:49:48] <ngoldbaum> i mean, ImageNet and other similar very closed form classification things seem mostly ok? it‚Äôs people trying to shoehorn it into everything that‚Äôs the problem
[23:49:57] <gwozniak> Yeah
[23:49:59] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[23:50:14] <mouseghost> imode, not all. it does have some legitimate use.
[23:50:16] <Brekkjern> I don't see how ML/AI as a concept is flawed.
[23:50:18] <gwozniak> It is certainly useful.  But the belief is that it applies to everything equally well
[23:50:36] <imode> put it to you this way. function approximation is useful.
[23:50:43] <imode> in very few cases.
[23:50:47] <imode> as has been noted.
[23:51:00] *** Quits: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:51:08] <imode> ML as a term is obscene.
[23:51:11] <Brekkjern> I'd imagine ML would be great for support stuff if you still have humans as backup.
[23:51:14] <imode> the machine isn't learning.
[23:51:20] <imode> you're tuning a pile of linear algebra.
[23:51:36] <gwozniak> ML/AI in the compiler is about as dumb as an online "Compiler as a Service"
[23:51:47] <gwozniak> Which I also analyzed at one point
[23:51:52] <imode> ridiculous, all of it.
[23:52:22] <gwozniak> I thought maybe there _could_ be something with a "CaaS" but when you play it out, there isn't
[23:52:40] <Brekkjern> What is CaaS?
[23:52:45] <Brekkjern> I mean... functionally
[23:52:46] <imode> compiler as a service.
[23:52:47] <gwozniak> "Compiler as a Service"
[23:52:47] <imode> oh.
[23:52:50] <imode> hahaha.
[23:52:55] <Brekkjern> "We send you some code and you compile it?"
[23:52:59] <gwozniak> Yes
[23:53:03] <imode> "submit us some code and we'll compile it"
[23:53:35] <Brekkjern> I could imagine that would work decently if it is a third party that deals with trust, but other than that I don't really see the point?
[23:53:36] <gwozniak> Sure, Compiler Explorer shows it can work, but that is a specific type
[23:54:14] <gwozniak> Honestly, if I'm a company developing, say, firmware for a chip, would I want to upload the source on the network all the time?
[23:54:23] <imode> isn't "compiler as a service" just a build system.
[23:54:32] <Brekkjern> imode: That's what I am thinking really
[23:54:35] <gwozniak> Yes, that's what it ends up being
[23:54:54] <gwozniak> IBM had me look into this, btw
[23:54:56] <imode> who's head do I need to get out of marketing's ass to stop appending `aaS` to everything.
[23:55:21] <Brekkjern> I'm just thinking that the CaaS could have provisions for signing the binary, revocation of signatures, etc
[23:55:27] <manicennui> The problem with ML/"AI" is that it is mostly good enough for things that don't really matter, and highly annoying in most other cases.
[23:55:28] <gwozniak> Let's not get into how slow this would be
[23:57:18] <imode> I had someone try to pitch to me K-means clustering on vectors of stack traces. to avoid reading the stack traces.
[23:57:29] <gwozniak> ...
[23:57:36] <imode> yeah.
[23:58:26] <gwozniak> To be fair, ML in a compiler does seem like a fit at a high-level.  There are lots of heuristics and pattern searches in an optimizer
[23:58:36] <gwozniak> But practically, it's not very good
[23:58:55] <gwozniak> Someone added something to GCC ages ago and it went nowhere
