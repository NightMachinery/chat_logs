[00:00:10] <dimadima> indigo: how dare you.
[00:00:25] <manicennui> But Apple only offered a few parts of the puzzle with no compelling reason to use them.
[00:00:47] <manicennui> And after they dropped them, companies should be highly suspicious of future offerings.
[00:00:48] <dimadima> xserves looked really cool imo
[00:01:29] <manicennui> One thing I'll give MS credit for is dumping a huge amount of money and resources into making things successful, continuing with them long after most companies would have given up.
[00:01:55] <manicennui> Their reasons for doing so were perhaps not for the benefit of customers.
[00:02:07] <manicennui> But ultimately it was probably better for customers who did invest in them.
[00:02:48] <manicennui> Modern product development seems to be "throw shit against the wall and see what sticks".
[00:03:12] <manicennui> With no thought given to users who invest time and resources into the product.
[00:03:23] <manicennui> Everything has to be a huge success or it dies.
[00:03:43] <dimadima> its capitalism
[00:03:58] <dimadima> opportunity cost, why bear it when returns could be higher
[00:04:41] <dimadima> it's not a position i can argue against
[00:04:47] <manicennui> You could argue that you scare off customers from investing in your future products.
[00:05:00] <dimadima> but you see google
[00:05:08] <manicennui> I think the only reason why people use Google's chat products is because the investment is low.
[00:05:14] <manicennui> But they'll never become Discord.
[00:05:26] <dimadima> yeah
[00:05:48] <manicennui> They still have like a few products that make all of their revenue.

[00:15:54] <manicennui> I try to block as much of it as possible.
[00:16:04] <manicennui> I even pay for YT Premium because I watch a lot of YT on my TV.
[00:17:08] <dimadima> could probably find out in their public filings
[00:17:15] <manicennui> I probably watch YT more than any other streaming service other than when I'm binging some show.
[00:17:19] <dimadima> but wahtever
[00:17:30] <manicennui> dimadima: Companies often don't break things down that well.
[00:17:49] <manicennui> Search is Google’s most lucrative unit. In 2020, the company generated $104 billion in “search and other” revenues, making up 71% of Google’s ad revenue and 57% of Alphabet’s total revenue.
[00:17:55] <manicennui> That's about as close as you will get.
[00:18:04] <dimadima> so that's a lot of revenue
[00:18:11] <manicennui> That “search and other” figure includes revenue generated on Google’s search properties, along with ads on other Google-owned properties like Gmail, Maps and the Google Play app store.
[00:18:15] <dimadima> search = ads
[00:18:20] <manicennui> dimadima: Yeah, but consider YT.
[00:18:20] <dimadima> in terms of revenue, right
[00:18:32] <manicennui> Unless YT is not included in that.
[00:19:24] <manicennui> "While Search and other properties make up the bulk of Google’s ad revenues, its YouTube advertising business, which saw a near 50% year-over-year jump in the first quarter, is increasingly grabbing ad dollars away from traditional linear television."
[00:19:39] <manicennui> So it must be separate.
[00:19:49] <dimadima> so adsense is huge i guess
[00:20:06] <dimadima> YT has become very aggressive with ads
[00:20:09] <manicennui> Here we go.
[00:20:11] <manicennui> "YouTube is the smallest of Google’s three main advertising revenue sources, accounting for nearly $20 billion in revenue in 2020 — about 13% of Google’s total ad revenues."
[00:20:20] <dimadima> remarkable
[00:20:28] <dimadima> i guess big businesses pay to be at the top of results
[00:20:58] <manicennui> "The third main component of Google’s advertising revenue is the Google Network, which at $23 billion in 2020 made up about 16% of its total ad revenues."
[00:21:17] <manicennui> "This bucket includes revenue generated from selling ads outside of Google’s own properties. Generally speaking, publishers or app makers can use Google platforms such as AdSense, Google Ad Manager, or AdMob to offer ad slots up for sale to advertisers."
[00:21:47] <dimadima> so that's adsense too

[00:22:51] <manicennui> The ads were included in one of the previous quotes.
[00:23:08] <manicennui> I think we are in a slump in general for smartphones.
[00:23:20] <manicennui> They are just trying to milk them for everything they can right now (not Google).
[00:23:26] <dimadima> i like my SE 2020 and my wife's X
[00:23:30] <dimadima> great phones
[00:23:54] <dimadima> whatever iphone i have is always the best phone i ever had. never was the case w/ android
[00:24:03] <dimadima> i had two androids and they were both shiiiiit
[00:24:14] <manicennui> I have a Pixel 3 and an iPhone 12, and had a Motorola G. They all seem about the same to me, with different minor annoyances.
[00:24:19] <manicennui> I actually like the Pixel 3 the most.
[00:24:26] <ben> pixel phones are quite solid
[00:24:29] <dimadima> iphone SE (v1) will get iOS 15
[00:24:38] <ben> great cameras
[00:24:40] <dimadima> that's a 6 year old phone receiving an OS update
[00:24:44] <manicennui> I probably don't use half the features that most people use though.
[00:24:48] <dimadima> ben: i need an android, will get a pixel probably
[00:24:50] <manicennui> I could not care less about improvements in the cameras.
[00:24:54] <dimadima> ben: any paritcular version you can recommend
[00:24:54] <manicennui> And never use Facetime.
[00:25:01] <ben> i like the -a versions
[00:25:08] <dimadima> i use all that facetime shit a lot
[00:25:08] <ben> cheap and still have headphone jacks
[00:25:10] <dimadima> it works really well
[00:25:16] <dimadima> thank you ben
[00:25:18] <ben> 4a is $350 and 5a is $450 i think
[00:25:22] <ben> brand new
[00:25:31] <dimadima> i just need a dev phone so i'm not testing on emulators
[00:25:41] <manicennui> Motorolas are decent for that.
[00:25:44] <manicennui> Nice and cheap.
[00:25:51] <ben> ah yeah those would be fine too
[00:25:53] <manicennui> Depending on what you want to test.
[00:25:59] <ben> i think they run pretty close to stock android
[00:26:04] <manicennui> If you want to test high end games, maybe not.
[00:26:16] <manicennui> Yeah, the Moto G I had didn't add much.
[00:26:23] <dimadima> i'll need a few because they all behave pretty differently, at least the emsulators do
[00:26:27] <manicennui> I think Verizon added something, but not the Motorola crap was optional.
[00:26:42] <manicennui> s/not the/the/
[00:27:09] <dimadima> ben: you mean pixels run close to stock android, or pixels
[00:27:10] <manicennui> I also think the Pixel 3 is the perfect size.
[00:27:19] <ben> pixels run stock android, moto is close
[00:27:26] <manicennui> I have an iPhone 12 mini, and it is just a bit too small for my liking.
[00:27:26] <dimadima> cool
[00:27:30] <ben> i think the 4a is the same size as the 3
[00:27:42] <ben> less bezel though
[00:28:03] <manicennui> I also think the Pixel stand is one of the best accessories out there.
[00:28:09] <manicennui> And I prefer it to Apple's wireless charger.
[00:28:19] <manicennui> Especially if you use your phone as an alarm.
[00:28:38] <manicennui> I ended up buying a cheap physical alarm clock though.
[00:29:04] <ben> mm i'm not sure the a models have wireless charging

[00:29:09] <buttsbot> Google Pixel Stand - Pixel 3 Wireless Charging Stand - Google Store
[00:29:21] <manicennui> They have some cool features where the phone realizes that it is in the stand.
[00:29:38] <ben> oh maybe it does?
[00:30:06] <manicennui> The 3 does.
[00:30:11] <manicennui> I'd be surprised if later models didn't.
[00:30:45] <manicennui> The 3 also has a USB-C connector. Fuck the iPhone's lightning connector.
[00:31:34] <manicennui> I'm torn on whether I want to switch my personal phone back to Android.
[00:31:52] <manicennui> The one feature I do use on the iPhone is the ability to forward texts to other Apple devices.
[00:33:39] <manicennui> Not a great reason to stick with it though.
[00:34:12] <manicennui> It would be nice if Android were just clearly superior, and there were Android tablets that came close to Apple's.
[00:35:59] <manicennui> And to continue the fantasy, if Chromebooks were as good as Apple laptops.
[00:36:12] <manicennui> I'd gladly be a Google whore.
[00:36:31] <gwozniak> My wife uses an iPhone and is not switching.  I don't care enough to use something else, so I use an iPhone too.
[00:36:46] <gwozniak> I used an Android phone a few years ago and hated it with a passion
[00:37:50] <manicennui> gwozniak: Android devices vary wildly.
[00:38:14] <dimadima> gwozniak: what did you hate
[00:38:18] <dimadima> do you remember which phone it was
[00:39:35] <gwozniak> Nexus 5, or whatever the latest Nexus version was back in 2015
[00:41:59] <dimadima> my androids were severely fucked up
[00:42:04] <manicennui> The Pixel 5 vs 5a products are bizarre.
[00:42:06] <dimadima> i got the bad ones
[00:42:09] <manicennui> Neither is clearly better than the other.
[00:42:21] <manicennui> The 5a is cheaper, but better than the 5 in certain areas.
[00:42:33] <manicennui> And the 5 is better in a couple of others that are hard to reason about.
[00:43:00] <manicennui> Does 6 vs 8 GB of RAM matter for most usage?
[00:43:36] <manicennui> Obviously it is probably better to have more, but is it $250 better?
[00:43:58] <manicennui> And the cheaper phone has a slightly larger screen and slightly better battery life.
[00:44:25] <dimadima> strange
[00:44:28] <manicennui> I can't see how the case material matters when most people are going to put another case on it.
[00:45:10] <manicennui> And then there is the 4a with 5g, which is $50 more than the 5a?
[00:45:27] <manicennui> What is the thinking behind their product line?
[00:49:05] <manicennui> Looks like the 5's screen has a slightly higher ppi and a 90Hz refresh rate instead of the 60Hz of the 5a. It also has class 6 gorilla glass vs class 3 (I assume that is better).
[00:49:06] <dimadima> sounds pretty weird
[00:49:15] <manicennui> These just seem like really minor differences.
[00:49:42] <manicennui> Oh, the 5a doesn't do wireless charging?
[00:50:52] <manicennui> The 5 also does mmWave 5G whereas they both do Sub6 5G.
[00:51:00] <manicennui> Guess I'd have to look up which providers use mmWave.
[00:52:44] <dimadima> i don't get how ppl make shit over a weekend or whatever
[00:54:04] <manicennui> What kind of shit?
[00:54:26] <dimadima> whatever shit. ppl always post "made this in a weekend, what do you think"
[00:54:31] <dimadima> apps
[00:54:33] <dimadima> websites
[00:55:00] <manicennui> Just add minimal functionality.
[00:55:05] <dimadima> i'm sitting here adjusting CSS to fit the safe-area-insets of an iphone while making sure i don't break desktop
[00:55:09] <dimadima> lol
[00:55:09] <manicennui> You can throw together an app with several frameworks very quickly.
[00:55:17] <dimadima> not me
[00:55:20] <dimadima> maybe you ;)
[00:55:36] <manicennui> I mostly do nothing outside of work.
[00:55:37] <dimadima> and before you call me a perfectionist-- i dont think i am
[00:56:06] <manicennui> And I avoid frontend work.
[00:57:05] <dimadima> frontend is so much harder than backend for me
[00:57:12] <dimadima> backend work is legitimately pleasant
[00:58:19] <dimadima> love my backend for this project, any time i have to do something in that code it's literally soothing
[00:58:29] <dimadima> anxiety goes down like 3 notches
[01:01:44] <indigo> dimadima: I think when people say "made this in a weekend" they really mean "finished it this weekend"
[01:02:30] <indigo> Also good luck if you want to make an SPA in a weekend
[01:04:23] <dimadima> indigo: do would make me feel better, but i wonder
[01:04:43] <dimadima> s/do/that/
[01:06:22] <manicennui> As long as you keep comparing yourself to others you will never feel better.
[01:06:38] <manicennui> There is always someone out there who is much better than you.
[01:07:17] <manicennui> I realize that one can't be convinced to stop caring though.
[01:07:56] <dimadima> oh haha i was going to say "don't get me wrong, i'm not too down on myself"
[01:08:09] <dimadima> don't get me wrong, i'm not too down on mysef :)
[01:08:30] <dimadima> i'm doing whatever i need to do given my skill levels and what my requirements are
[01:08:49] <dimadima> there's just this sort of cult out there of ppl building shit "over the weekend" or claiming to
[01:08:54] <dimadima> and it's like "damn, no way"

[01:16:58] <dimadima> #1 gripe about chicago is there's no street business
[01:17:00] <dimadima> in general
[01:17:08] <manicennui> Street businesses?
[01:17:18] <manicennui> -es
[01:17:26] <dimadima> like in new york there's vendors everywhere. fruit vendors, chochke vendors
[01:17:30] <dimadima> fake watch vendors
[01:17:31] <manicennui> Ah.
[01:17:46] <dimadima> ethnic neighborhoods have even more variety of street vending
[01:17:47] <manicennui> That exists to some extent.
[01:17:59] <dimadima> and now with the lawlessness going on, the street vending has exploded
[01:18:04] <manicennui> Much more so in the Hispanic neighborhoods.
[01:18:11] <dimadima> nice
[01:18:17] <dimadima> hispanics for the win
[01:18:21] <manicennui> I think businesses bitch about anything competing with them.
[01:18:23] <manicennui> Including food trucks.
[01:18:26] <dimadima> yes that's what happened
[01:18:40] <dimadima> chicago used to have tons of street vending but then businesses worked to get it outlawed
[01:18:53] <dimadima> i mean, that's my understanding of what happned
[01:19:08] <manicennui> In my old neighborhood, Albany Park, there were definitely Mexican street vendors.
[01:19:15] <manicennui> Ice cream, corn, and fruit.
[01:19:26] <dimadima> what were the fruit stands like
[01:19:54] <manicennui> I remember coconuts turned into drinks.
[01:20:02] <manicennui> Some other fruits that I don't really recall.
[01:20:08] <dimadima> here are some typical produce stands in New york

[01:20:50] <manicennui> Yeah, not like that.
[01:21:05] <manicennui> But the same neighborhoods also has a lot of smaller produce markets/grocery stores.
[01:21:22] <dimadima> that's nice
[01:21:23] <manicennui> I think the one reason why I don't mind not having street vendors is because there are so many restaurants and stores everywhere.
[01:21:25] <dimadima> okay fuck i'm going to focus

[03:18:47] <manicennui> I've started using other services for certain items, like household goods.
[03:19:06] <manicennui> Amazon's pricing and availability has always been all over the place for household goods.
[03:19:42] <manicennui> I've also found that it's often better to buy blu rays on ebay.
[03:24:50] <manicennui> Other items that Amazon will ship for free with Prime and deliver the next day are kind of insane, like televisions and furniture.
[03:44:50] <dimadima> for the above-mentioned item the price was to-the-cent identical
[03:59:50] <manicennui> I also hate dealing with all of the other sellers on Amazon.
[04:00:07] <manicennui> Only time I will buy from a third-party seller is if they are the manufacturer or it is used.
[04:22:23] <dimadima> i've never had to deal w/ any in particular. anything comes up i go into chat
[04:22:45] <dimadima> i don't buy much stuff though, and have never bought expensive things on amazon that you read horror stories about

[06:30:21] <manicennui> It has been an immigrant landing ground for a long time.

[06:36:45] <dimadima> that play looks great. you saw it on youtube on in person?
[06:37:11] <manicennui> In person years ago
[06:37:16] <manicennui> At the Goodman
[06:37:34] <manicennui> It is about immigrants in Albany Park and their food.

[06:46:35] <dimadima> is there any particular reason you saw a high school play? i'm asking cause i feel like there's tons of good stuff under the radar. you'd never think a high school play would be one of your favorite things
[06:46:40] <dimadima> but it easily could be
[06:47:03] <dimadima> i guess this isn't really a "high school play"
[06:47:21] <dimadima> but it's not like pro theatre
[06:48:06] *** Joins: n3t (n3t@s45.mydevil.net)
[06:49:27] <manicennui> It wasn't at a high school play.
[06:49:33] <manicennui> It was a play by high school students.
[06:49:39] <manicennui> The Goodman is a top theater company in Chicago.
[06:49:55] <manicennui> One of the main theater venues.
[06:49:56] <dimadima> < kiedtl> Lobste.rs is, by the way, just HN for Rust
[06:49:58] <dimadima> i thought this was a joke
[06:50:12] <manicennui> I mostly went because I liked the subject matter and it was really cheap.
[06:50:50] <dimadima> well yeah, by high school students, even really good ones
[06:50:57] <dimadima> it's not like, professional actors
[06:51:01] <dimadima> but like you said, the goodman

[06:55:05] <manicennui> dimadima: I enjoyed it more than most of the "professional" plays I saw.
[06:55:21] <manicennui> It was about my neighborhood and food.
[06:55:25] <manicennui> And it was well done.
[06:55:35] <manicennui> The version I saw had more music I believe.
[06:55:43] <dimadima> those surprise experiences are the best
[07:00:53] <manicennui> Today I learned that Metallica played the Metro the other night.
[07:00:58] <manicennui> It was a surprise show.
[07:01:03] <manicennui> And the Metro is a small venue.
[07:05:43] <dimadima> that is pretty cool
[07:06:03] <dimadima> i wouldn't want to play big shows if i was metallica either
[07:06:15] <dimadima> those guys have done that enough
[07:09:32] <manicennui> Can't make enough money playing small venues
[07:09:37] <manicennui> Believe they charged $20 too
[07:10:31] <manicennui> Wilco does a winter tour here every year, usually at the Chicago Theater, which is larger than the Metro, but nowhere near as big as an arena.
[07:10:38] <manicennui> They play 5 shows up a row, and they all sell out
[07:37:13] <dimadima> they're probably not trying to make too much moeny
[07:37:23] <dimadima> they're pretty old and probably just trying to have fun
[07:37:28] <dimadima> i'm guessing they didn't invest w/ madoff
[07:39:16] <manicennui> They are from here.
[07:39:53] <manicennui> They used to only do a couple of shows in Chicago, but it expanded because so many people wanted to see them.
[08:10:00] <dimadima> i meant metallica
[08:14:01] <klardotsh> manicennui: Chicago always gets the secret shows, ugh. I wasn't in town for the 2014 secret Foo Fighters show at the Cubby Bear either sadly
[08:16:44] <manicennui> I've never managed to catch a secret show, but I've been to a lot of great concerts here.

[18:26:51] <prussian> All I know is, there is no one size fits all and it all sucks and it's everyone's fault.
[18:26:51] <riv> https://twitter.com/david_chisnall hmm
[18:26:52] *** Quits: buttsbot (~buttsbot@31.187.71.242) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:26:52] <prussian> somehow.
[18:26:57] <riv> his knowledge is being surpressed
[18:27:02] *** Joins: buttsbot (~buttsbot@31.187.71.242)
[18:27:05] <prussian> so true...
[18:27:27] <gwozniak> file hierarchy sucks, too.  To me the real problem is actually tagging/sorting/whatever, which is what no one really wants to do
[18:27:35] <prussian> THIS
[18:27:56] *** Joins: dcz (~dcz@user/dcz)
[18:27:58] <gwozniak> Imposing the structure in the first place is the problem.  And searching hasn't really solved that either
[18:28:13] <prussian> I can't even search well apparently.
[18:28:14] <gwozniak> But it's easier with searching than without
[18:28:33] <prussian> all I know is I half ass a structure and just see if it sticks or not.
[18:29:30] <gwozniak> Seems most people do basically the same thing: a few buckets that you initially toss things in, then rummage through those buckets at some point
[18:29:56] <gwozniak> But you cut down the search space by using those buckets
[18:30:35] <gwozniak> Managing music and pictures manually with a file hierarchy sucks major ass, which is why something to do it for you is so popular
[18:30:53] <prussian> ^ can confirm.
[18:33:38] <manicennui> And that bucket is the desktop.
[18:33:42] <prussian> lol.
[18:34:10] <prussian> well at work, we have an S3 bucket that was basically "yolo" til I started reshaping it.
[18:34:22] <prussian> based on how we actually access data in it and all.
[18:34:42] <prussian> hell, categorizing is hard, but so is writing security policies.
[18:36:24] <manicennui> Google Docs seems to be a big problem in this regard.
[18:36:59] <manicennui> Of course far too many people like to keep 40 copies of the same data in sheets and try to keep it synced with other systems.
[18:37:25] <prussian> data, can't live with it, can't live without it.
[18:37:49] * ngoldbaum twitches because “data” is plural
[18:37:57] <ngoldbaum> are plural fuck
[18:42:02] <edm> ha
[18:42:12] <Xe> ngoldbaum: i thought data was a mass noun
[18:42:20] <Xe> which means you treat it as singular
[18:42:25] <Xe> like money or water
[18:42:36] <ngoldbaum> no datum is singular
[18:42:41] <ngoldbaum> data are plural
[18:42:57] <ngoldbaum> but also english is a fucking living language and rules are meaningless
[18:42:57] <Xe> are you trying to heckin break my noggin lol
[18:43:26] <ngoldbaum> here are cats in a sunspot to soothe your noggin

[18:46:15] <edm> I do think this a lot
[18:46:30] <edm> being british you notice all the americanisms creeping in
[18:46:45] <edm> like smog around the edges of a door you locked
[18:46:58] <Xe> one british thing that confuses me is "in hospotal" instead of "in the hospital"
[18:47:05] <Xe> hospital*
[18:47:22] <edm> i think either would be acceptable here
[18:47:44] <edm> probably the latter is more of a geographic answer
[18:47:50] <edm> and the former is more why you're not at work
[18:48:01] <Xe> fair
[18:48:22] <Xe> oh and how you fuck up the name of the last letter of the alphabet lol
[18:48:29] <edk> Xe: if you think that's weird you should see swedish
[18:48:32] <edk> they say "on hospital"
[18:48:36] * ngoldbaum inserts u’s behind o’s randomly to please edm
[18:48:48] <ngoldbaum> excuse me randoumly
[18:48:51] <edm> I don't really like (and this is more internet english than americanisms but there's a large overlap) the explicit writing down of verbal ticks in online communication
[18:49:07] <Xe> edm: have you seen "typing quirks" yet?
[18:49:08] <edm> 'could you like, um, not?'
[18:49:27] <ngoldbaum> ell oh ell
[18:49:28] <edm> i automatically read it in the manner of a kardashian
[18:49:30] <riv> ah hospital*
[18:49:31] <edm> but grown men do it
[18:49:32] <riv> an*
[18:49:46] <edk> i think it's done to elicit that effect
[18:49:46] <riv> can't believe people tried to make 'an hospital' a thing
[18:49:52] <edm> edk: it was
[18:49:57] <edm> but it creeps
[18:49:59] <edk> it's not unheard-of for written dialogue to have filler
[18:50:36] <Xe> edm: occasionally kids in discords i moderate will type like this: "h3ll0, h0w ar3 y0u t0day?"
[18:50:36] <edm> but it's very strange. a sort of calculated spontaneity
[18:50:45] <edk> and you could think of online communication as written dialogue that happens to be being written in real time by its subjects
[18:50:46] <edk> well, is it?
[18:51:01] <edm> um
[18:51:02] <edm> um
[18:51:02] <ngoldbaum> l’hospital
[18:51:02] <edm> um
[18:51:04] <Xe> then we have to tell them to stop
[18:51:05] <edk> i mean it's still spontaneous in that it wasn't planned in advance
[18:51:08] <Xe> and they get mad
[18:51:09] <edm> i'm thinking of an answer hold on
[18:51:10] <edm> um

[18:54:20] <Xe> I'm also fairly sure they're the person that keeps randomly flagging my comments
[18:56:23] <edk> edm: have you come across the school of thought that spoken english and written english are different languages?
[18:56:26] <prussian> epic...
[18:56:28] <edm> i am not important enough to have anything flagged thankfully
[18:56:52] <edm> edk: i've never really understood it

[18:57:13] <goodger> you'll believe any old bollocks, though
[18:57:16] <riv> > Peter then effectively makes a joke about Brandon Dube escalating to a known admin because of the problems in the conversation, by imitating a child yelling "TEACHER!" when a fellow student is causing problems. He's infantilizing Brandon with this statement, indicating that he's a child. There is no purpose to do that beyond trying to completely neg someone.
[18:57:20] <riv> lol that reminds me goodger
[18:58:23] <edm> not only is neg a verb apparently
[18:58:26] <edm> but to completely neg
[18:58:31] <edm> where no one has negged before
[18:58:36] <edk> do you hate split infinitives as well
[18:58:43] <Xe> edm: you can verb any word if you careful
[18:58:52] <mgdm> edk: I'm fine with those, I don't speak latin
[18:58:53] <edm> i never verbify my nouns
[18:58:57] <edm> i stop at gerunds
[18:59:13] <edk> mgdm: same
[19:02:29] <edk> the different languages thing is not without its problems as an argument but i do think it suggests that one might type in either dialect in much the same way one converses in a register appropriate to the conversation
[19:02:42] <edk> that doesn't seem too terrible to me
[19:03:56] <edm> sure and it's largely aesthetic, of course i accept there are not firm rules
[19:04:10] <edm> it's more like which subset of c++ features and idioms are we going to use
[19:04:59] <edm> but to me this sort of thing is 'kind of, um..., sort of performative?'
[19:05:23] <edm> and almost getting into creepy asterisks territory
[19:05:35] <edm> and so i find it off-putting. but that's just me
[19:05:38] <mgdm> I had thought about things like that before and I assumed it was down to the amount of time you have to think when you're writing vs. when you're speaking
[19:06:11] <mgdm> also if you're speaking face to face with people there are some out of band ways to move the converation along, I guess
[19:07:01] <ngoldbaum> edm: it comes from chat, it’s easier to communicate emotional context over text if you include vocal tics
[19:07:46] <edm> that just makes me...
[19:07:54] <edm> *sighs, eyes start to well, looks at the ground*
[19:07:55] <edm> sad
[19:08:27] <edm> but fine, I am not saying I don't understand it and i need it explaining
[19:08:30] <edm> i just don't like it
[19:10:20] <ngoldbaum> that’s just, like, your opinion, man
[19:11:05] <edm> indeed
[19:11:40] <edm> even my implication that performative=bad is arbitrary and comes with lots of cultural baggage, i know that
[19:12:29] <riv> interesting :)

[20:03:59] <dimadima> i disagree with that commenter
[20:04:11] <dimadima> i didn't start with a z80, but i started with a 286, and i hate folders
[20:04:28] <riv> i feel like im going to go against the grain here - I personally think folders are good and we should learn to use them

[20:04:52] <dimadima> riv: i don't think you're going against the grain? wouldn't most people agree?
[20:04:56] <Brekkjern> Folders are excellent for separating things that have nothing to do with each other

[20:05:25] <edm> he also thought in bulletpoints though

[20:05:38] <edm> so i think he just had mental problems

[20:06:09] <edm> he also capitalised things a lot
[20:06:21] <riv> hehe
[20:06:24] <edm> e.g. on the whiteboard in our office i might right 'todo' for a current project
[20:06:30] <edm> whereas he would write something like
[20:06:41] <edm> 'Work Task Item Priority List'
[20:06:56] <edm> beneath which would be many bulletpoints
[20:09:58] <edm> and finally he tried to make us do versioning by enforcing a file name system along the lines of $name_vN_YYYYMMDD
[20:10:02] <edm> where N was the version number
[20:10:23] <edm> i think us trying to make him use git was what made him quit in the end, so I am forever thankful to linus torvalds
[20:11:38] <dimadima> edm: god
[20:11:40] <dimadima> that's horrible

[20:11:51] <dimadima> $name_vN_YYYYMMDD says it sall
[20:12:14] <dimadima> will i really suffer $name_vN_YYYYMMDD until i die
[20:12:14] <edm> he was a mechanical engineer
[20:12:34] <edm> they don't teach them the birds and the bees and university
[20:12:35] <riv> at least its YYYYMMDD rather than MMDDYYYY
[20:12:41] <dimadima> lol

[20:13:06] <edm> MMDDYYYY is an america-only horror
[20:13:10] <edm> like 'i could care less'
[20:13:45] <riv> you can implement a tagging system on top of a directory based filesystem, simply use filenames with tags like [xxx] [yyy] in them + software that indexes this and provides filtering etc.
[20:15:03] <Brekkjern> That is a hack. Not a solution.
[20:15:11] <riv> whats wrong with hacks

[20:15:16] <buttsbot> Velkommen til Bergen! : norge
[20:15:25] <Brekkjern> Well, you need to re-index every time you add a tag
[20:15:48] <Brekkjern> At that point, why not just have a separate system that handles the tags, and just have a link to the file instead?
[20:16:06] <riv> that would work too

[20:59:28] <manicennui> I've only read the word.
[20:59:45] <ngoldbaum> LaTeX is pronounced lay-tech or lah-tech
[20:59:49] <ngoldbaum> i’ve heard both
[20:59:54] <dimadima> i've heard lah-tech
[20:59:59] <ngoldbaum> lay-tecks is just wrong
[21:00:08] <dimadima> i think it's a Chi or something
[21:00:13] <manicennui> I've never heard anyone talk about latex/tex.
[21:00:57] <dimadima> if you hang out around prententious grad sdutent types that's all they talk about
[21:01:10] <manicennui> Now I'm thinking about a group of mutant tech support people.
[21:01:12] <dimadima> sooner or later all of them start loving latex and can't not talk about it
[21:01:17] <dimadima> which is fair, it's pretty
[21:01:43] <manicennui> Hopefully you have a mutant who can squeeze into the plenum to run cable.
[21:01:53] <dimadima> that's a useful mutant
[21:02:44] <manicennui> I'm imagining the X-Men cartoon opening, with the great music, but with mutants fixing computer problems.

[21:41:38] <indigo> I think everyone moved to Kotlin at this point
[21:41:56] <gerikson> yeah I think Scala kinda flamed out
[21:46:11] <manicennui> There are plenty of Scala jobs and they pay *extremely* well.
[21:46:20] <manicennui> It just isn’t hyped
[21:47:14] <manicennui> There are definitely efforts to add Scala-like features to Kotlin with libraries like arrow

[22:16:35] <dimadima> it seems to have way more features than kotlin
[22:16:49] <manicennui> Too many features.
[22:17:04] <manicennui> Kotlin is a better Java. Scala is a wannabe Haskell.
[22:17:35] <dimadima> i haven't tried either one
[22:17:37] <dimadima> kotlin looks good
[22:17:44] <manicennui> I don't think that the new version of Scala is backwards compatible either.

[22:25:56] <dimadima> but these cave people, man
[22:26:17] <dimadima> i read a theory on HN comments that all this is to encourage liberal ppl to leave the state, a theory that i liked
[22:26:35] <dimadima> haha Brekkjern
[22:27:04] <manicennui> Is it even debatable? Texans clearly want the state to appeal more to Republicans.
[22:27:19] <manicennui> They keep voting for Republicans who enact laws that Republicans like.
[22:27:33] <Brekkjern> Rural Texans seem to be doing so at least
[22:27:36] <dimadima> i guess as i articulated it, it was banal
[22:27:43] <Brekkjern> I hear that the larger cities are much more liberal
[22:28:25] <manicennui> Brekkjern: As with virtually everywhere else in the US, there are more people in urban areas of Texas than rural.
[22:28:36] <manicennui> Brekkjern: They are to some extent.
[22:28:44] <manicennui> But Texas doesn't have any true large cities.
[22:28:54] <manicennui> It has sprawl.
[22:29:08] <manicennui> And Austin is tiny.
[22:29:31] <manicennui> Dallas-Forth Worth and Houston look like the suburbs of Chicago.
[22:29:50] <Brekkjern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[22:29:50] <Brekkjern> They are bigger than Oslo :P
[22:30:05] <dimadima> oslo is a real city, from the photos
[22:30:17] <manicennui> Houston population density is 3,630 per square mile.
[22:30:19] <dimadima> texas "cities" are some skyscrapers and miles and miles of sprawl
[22:30:24] <dimadima> lol
[22:30:32] <dimadima> 3630/sq mi
[22:30:53] <manicennui> Chicago is 11,783, but some neighborhoods are over 20k.
[22:31:13] <manicennui> NYC is 27k.
[22:31:28] <dimadima> i don't see how this would prevent spam filtering
[22:31:49] <manicennui> To give you some idea, Schaumburg, which is maybe ~15 miles from the edge of Chicago, is 3,862.0.
[22:31:52] <dimadima> putting something in a spam folder doesn't seem to "impede the transmission"
[22:32:31] <manicennui> dimadima: It would also never be used to prosecute a spam filtering.
[22:32:59] <manicennui> It's just people creating spectacle.
[22:33:14] <manicennui> The law is almost certainly unconstitutional.
[22:33:36] <manicennui> And not because it could be interpreted to apply to spam filtering.
[22:35:09] <manicennui> Republicans love to cry about individual free speech, unless that individual works at a company and doesn't do what some other individual wants.
[22:36:07] <manicennui> But somehow it comes back into play if that individual doesn't want to make a gay cake.

[23:07:53] <Brekkjern> I've heard so
[23:08:05] <Brekkjern> They don't trust the government, so they don't want to take it.

[23:12:52] <Brekkjern> Hmm. I read a while back that they didn't trust the health authorities
[23:13:52] <manicennui> Yeah, I definitely see some articles about their general anti-vax attitude.
[23:14:21] <manicennui> They have also weathered the pandemic better than most because they comply with mask/social distancing guidelines.
[23:16:09] <manicennui> Apparently they were hoping to develop a domestic vaccine, but weren't able to, and then had to compete with every other country to gain foreign vaccines.
[23:16:32] <manicennui> And they aren't willing to receive vaccines from people who aren't doctors or nurses.
