[02:56:54] <soulisson> calmclam, I'm ok :)
[02:57:07] <soulisson> Tired but ok :)
[02:57:24] <soulisson> calmclam, what's new?
[02:57:44] <calmclam> not much
[02:58:13] <soulisson> anything interesting :) ?
[03:00:48] <calmclam> nope
[03:01:04] <calmclam> windows 11 leaked, I guess that's kind of interesting
[03:01:19] <calmclam> but it's pretty boring too
[03:01:50] <soulisson> calmclam, oh. I saw some videos. I feels like it's going to be a bad release. I already don't like the GUI :)
[03:02:13] <calmclam> yeah changing the taskbar and start menu is risky business
[03:02:36] <calmclam> altho i really liked the win7 taskbar changes
[03:03:13] <calmclam> I also liked putting search in the start menu in windows vista
[03:03:19] <calmclam> but I did not much care for the changes after those

[03:03:55] <soulisson> Honestly, I just don't want to relearn to use the GUI. I was comfortable with how things were in windows 7 :)
[03:04:15] <calmclam> I'm OK with relearning stuff as long as I understand the benefit
[03:05:27] <soulisson> calmclam, your approach is healthier. For me, learning and relearning is just painful, lol, it requires efforts.
[03:05:37] <calmclam> Microsoft used to justify their UI changes with user research, there was like a 20-series blog post about the office ribbon

[03:37:51] <CoJaBo> They don't check for guest before setting the UID to the legacy permissions ID xD

[17:47:09] <dkasak[m]> Yeah, apps will generally require a trusted certificate but you'll be serving the certificate of your proxy. But you'll have this problem regardless of whether you use Burp, mitmproxy or something else.
[17:48:05] <dkasak[m]> There are ways around it, though. You'll generally want to install the CA certificate of your proxy to the system cert store
[17:49:28] <dkasak[m]> Many apps use pinning in addition, and for that you'll want to look into something like objection (https://github.com/sensepost/objection) which uses Frida to hook into and bypass TLS verification in common http libs

[19:16:46] <BUSY> yes, the latter - just had a similar discussion on ##crypto
[19:16:50] <khimaros[m]> i've had similar thoughts about "pass phrases". if the user knows you're using a pass phrase of a given length, it becomes easier to brute-force as a series of dictionary words. in practice though, i think attackers can't really make assumptions about your generation strategy.
[19:16:59] <BUSY> i was thinking that increasing the key length would be a net benefit

[19:17:49] <khimaros[m]> it probably is, in practice, but it does reduce the key space in theory. esp since md5 are of a common length.
[19:18:17] <khimaros[m]> so you can skip all of the 4 char, 5 char, etc.. when brute forcing if you know the strategy.

[19:26:52] <NiLon> there is no case where it makes sense, it is always a bad idea
[19:26:59] <richard_h> like using a long random password, stored in a secure db
[19:27:05] <khimaros[m]> BUSY: the short answer is there are better password generation schemes. use pwgen.
[19:27:23] <[iz]> yeah, you are confusing several ideas BUSY and coming up with something that is just terrible and useless
[19:27:43] <richard_h> aside - is the pw generation in keepass (and related software) ok?

[19:29:05] <[iz]> even if there was some sort of pseudo-randomness issue, there would be no way to attack it
[19:29:08] *** Joins: chuckx (~chuckx@user/chuckx)
[19:29:56] <richard_h> that depends how non-random it is, doesn't it?
[19:30:27] <[iz]> well, if it's just always the same value, then sure, it's easy
[19:30:27] *** Quits: chuckx (~chuckx@user/chuckx) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:30:41] <khimaros[m]> hm.. auditctl only seems to support a very minimal set of fields with -F. i wonder why this is. it doesn't let me filter on ses or subj for example, but auid and exe i can.
[19:30:43] <BUSY> thanks all!
[19:30:52] <[iz]> but i mean like a cryptographic attack where the attacker can figure out the seed for the randomizer and then predict what was randomized
[19:31:17] <NiLon> also pure md5 algo has a problem that if you reuse the password then the hash stays same and you avoided nothing
[19:31:28] <NiLon> in this world and time we must assume that password eventually will be leaked
[19:31:32] <[iz]> pw generation in a pw manager app isn't connected enough to the attacker to be able to do that

[19:33:05] *** Joins: chuckx (~chuckx@user/chuckx)
[19:33:11] <[iz]> even if the randomizer did tend to use 1 more than 2 50% of the time, would that really matter
[19:33:24] <richard_h> well, both are "randomly" generated chunks of data, no?
[19:34:14] <[iz]> the difference is how those chunks of data are used
[19:34:36] <richard_h> just had a look back - the RNG wasn't being seeded
[19:34:37] *** Quits: chuckx (~chuckx@user/chuckx) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:35:34] <NiLon> as long it is machine random instead of human random you are golden :p

[19:36:10] <richard_h> if the generator was sufficiently bad that it could only produce, say, 5000 possible passwords, then you might have a problem :-)
[19:36:38] *** Joins: chuckx (~chuckx@user/chuckx)
[19:37:29] <richard_h> anyway, I suspect picking a decent memorable master password for keepass is a bigger issue :-)
[19:38:18] <richard_h> especially since if I decide mine's not good enough, I should really change all the passwords I've stored with it ...
[19:38:23] <NiLon> it would be quite interesting to ask a lot of people to list ten random numbers from 0-9 and then plot it to see if there is some bias
[19:38:29] *** Joins: plasticuproject (~plasticup@user/plasticuproject)
[19:38:41] <NiLon> I'm quite sure there would be some interesting things, like third number likely never is 3 or then it is more often so etc.
[19:38:56] <[iz]> i recommend combining several "good" passwords you already know that you don't still use anywhere online for a master password
[19:39:10] <richard_h> ten random numbers with only 10 possibilities?
[19:39:49] <richard_h> [iz]: so like correct horse battery staple, but using non-dictionary words to start with?
[19:39:49] *** Quits: chuckx (~chuckx@user/chuckx) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:40:16] <richard_h> even randomly generated ones
[19:40:17] <[iz]> richard_h: yeah, basically using "good" password sequences that are already kinda burned into your mind and finger muscle memory
[19:40:51] *** Joins: chuckx (~chuckx@user/chuckx)
[19:41:05] <NiLon> richard_h yeah those first say 6 numbers are only interesting tho
[19:41:11] <NiLon> as likely the most of bias is there
[19:41:12] <[iz]> then you can have a long password that you don't forget that uses strong characters and sequences
[19:41:33] <richard_h> I guess it's feasible - there was a time when I could remember most of the randomly generated passwords for a cluster of about 15 servers ...
[19:42:00] <[iz]> yeah, i think its like.. ppl expect random to have an evenly random consistency.. when random actually has a random chunky consistency
[19:42:04] <richard_h> I think they were 'pronounceable' ones, though
