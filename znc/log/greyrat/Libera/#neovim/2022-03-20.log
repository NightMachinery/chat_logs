[06:05:32] <brother-darionbr> @ii14:matrix.org hi ii14, did you know why "   highlight clear SignColumn" didn't work when I put it in `.vimrc` file, even in last line, but work well when I run it manually run.
[06:06:08] <ii14[m]> `au ColorScheme * highlight clear SignColumn`?
[06:06:16] <ii14[m]> probably colorscheme overwrote it
[06:06:46] <brother-darionbr> Ok, Iet me try
[06:07:43] <brother-darionbr> > `au ColorScheme * highlight clear SignColumn`?
[06:07:43] <brother-darionbr> still not work
[06:08:20] *** Quits: arch-angel (~arch-ange@user/arch-angel) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:13:07] <ii14[m]> what does `:verb hi Signcolumn` say?
[06:14:32] <brother-darionbr> `SignColumn     xxx ctermfg=4 ctermbg=248 guifg=DarkBlue guibg=Grey
[06:14:32] <brother-darionbr> Press ENTER or type command to continue`
[06:15:34] <ii14[m]> au ColorScheme * highlight clear SignColumn
[06:15:34] <ii14[m]> highlight clear SignColumn
[06:15:38] <ii14[m]> do it like this
[06:15:52] <ii14[m]> both autocommand and normal
[06:16:50] <brother-darionbr> still the same
[06:17:57] <brother-darionbr> it's so weird
[06:18:56] <ii14[m]> and when you run it from the command line it works?
[06:19:50] <brother-darionbr> yes
[06:21:57] <ii14[m]> not sure then, it works for me
[06:23:33] <ii14[m]> maybe it's `clear` that doesn't work for whatever reason, and you actually need to define it
[06:23:54] <ii14[m]> with `guibg=#ffffff` etc
[06:24:22] <brother-darionbr> maybe cause  some of my plugin? I use the `coc.nvim `plug
[06:24:26] <ii14[m]> or link it to LineNr
[06:24:57] <ii14[m]> there is also FoldColumn btw
[06:25:35] <ii14[m]> if it was because of coc.nvim, `:verb hi SignColumn` would say that it was defined somewhere in coc.nvim
[06:26:15] <ii14[m]> at least I think so, I never used any nodejs plugins
[06:30:46] <brother-darionbr> all right,  let me try to comment some plug,  and try again,  there hadn't any better idea anyway.
[06:33:34] <brother-darionbr> but wait, I use the other color scheme work well too, It means doesn't has matter with any plug, right?
[06:35:50] <ii14[m]> with the `au ColorScheme *` it should work for everything
[06:40:08] <brother-darionbr> but It didn't work, so weird
[06:56:27] <brother-darionbr> the other color scheme work fine too, only `delek` didn't work

[14:43:12] <baltazar> hi!
[14:43:42] <baltazar> for some reason, block comment indents work weirdly for me for javascript
[14:44:46] <baltazar> if I type `/*` at a given indent level, then press enter, it inserts a `*` in the next line automatically which is fine, but it's indented with a whole tab further than needs to
[14:44:55] <baltazar> but the same thing works as expected in c for example

[16:32:30] <kallisti5[m]> so.. has neovim made a commitment to NOT :mouse=a ?  Cause if that's the case i'm thinking of symlinking vim to nvim in Haiku forever lol
[16:32:59] <clason[m]> wat?
[16:33:19] <kallisti5[m]> vim defaults to mouse mode since 7.8.  It drives me bonkers
[16:33:46] <kallisti5[m]> it looks like the default neovim config doesn't do mouse mode which brings me much joy (beyond the other awesome features)
[16:34:10] <clason[m]> yeah, mouse is not set by default
[16:34:29] <kallisti5[m]> that's an awesome feature.  Please never change that one :-)
[16:34:39] <kallisti5[m]> mouse mode is the devil
[16:36:18] <clason[m]> it was tried seven years ago; after much complaints it was reverted
[16:36:38] <kallisti5[m]> awesome.   I will install neovim on every damn server going forward
[16:36:44] <clason[m]> I don't think it'll come back in this form, although someone might find a smarter way to do it
[16:36:58] <jk[m]> neovim regularly corrupts my files when i use undo. anyone else have the same experience?
[16:37:13] <clason[m]> no.
[16:37:13] <ii14[m]> no

[17:31:37] <Treibholz> Hi, is it possible, to use multiple fonts in neovim-qt? Like if a symbol is not available in the main font, to pick it from the second one?
[17:34:27] <baltazar> clason[m]: neither option seems to do much...
[17:34:46] <clason[m]> yeah, might not work for legacy highlights yet
[17:34:47] <baltazar> I tried setting my highlight group's blend attribute as well but it doesn't do anything either
[17:35:19] <baltazar> and based on the help text it only works for background color
[17:35:21] <clason[m]> then I'd follow the zen-mode approach
[17:36:24] <baltazar> that just sets them to be a fixed color, kinda lame
[17:36:28] <baltazar> but I gues it'll have to do
[17:36:54] <clason[m]> try looking into `winblend`
[17:37:24] <baltazar> isn't that only for floating windows?
[17:37:31] <clason[m]> yes
[17:37:41] <clason[m]> that's what zen-mode uses, I believe
[17:38:04] <Treibholz> in gvim this works (automatically): https://pasteboard.co/mgocFXJ9mpbS.png, in neovim-qt: https://pasteboard.co/f4QOGfY6ZN5y.png
[17:38:19] <clason[m]> gotta check the nvim-qt documentation
[17:39:23] <baltazar> clason[m]: seemingly it uses twilight, which seems to just create a highlight group with a fixed color, and no mention of winblend
[17:40:30] <clason[m]> yeah, I meant only for creating the float overlay
[17:40:44] <clason[m]> the `winblend` you'd have to do yourself
[17:41:01] <bfredl> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/17776/commits/ad2570304500b4a01b7849084cbdc57c22ecf21e this was easier than I expected

[17:55:08] <baltazar> zen-mode readme: > Twilight is optional to dim inactive portions of your code

[20:25:57] <puremourning> guys does neovim use libevent ?
[20:26:08] <clason[m]> it uses libuv
[20:26:18] <puremourning> oh yah, thanks
[20:26:48] <puremourning> well i guess the question is the same, anyone with experience of using it here?
[20:27:03] <bfredl> some :)
[20:27:20] <puremourning> wdyt bfredl ? is it a good api?
[20:27:56] <puremourning> wait, that's a dumb question. i'll think of a better one
[20:28:06] <bfredl> good enough to manage a few sockets and named pipes :)
[20:29:02] <puremourning> i'm in a stage of thinkning about a project that will have exactly that (some sockets, some IO, some pipes, some subprocesses, etc.) and in that phase of "should i write the code, or should i try and find a library that i won't hate"
[20:29:34] <bfredl> I'd say you'll want to start with a library like libuv
[20:30:08] <bfredl> and once/if you feel you are fighting the library instead of fighting the target domain, it makes sense to consider rolling something low-level yourself :)
[20:30:25] <puremourning> i looked at poco for example and noped out of it in like 5s. libevent seemed ot have a nice "just use the best select() replacement on the OS" but then seems to come with a ton of other baggage. boost is a certain no. i rememberd that neovim had something like libevent.
[20:30:52] <bfredl> I think it always was libuv for neovim
[20:31:03] <puremourning> yeah it probably was; i had conflated them in my head
[20:31:53] <bfredl> one thing to consider is that libuv doesn't do memory management at all. so you allocate buffers and pass in them for libuv to use, and then libuv calls you back when it is doen with them.
[20:32:07] <puremourning> wait, why does libuv have a "ANSI escape code controlled TTY"
[20:32:19] <bfredl> it is for windows :)
[20:32:33] <puremourning> ok bfredl i like it already if that's its memory model. that is the correct model for a library
[20:32:38] <bfredl> on posix it just uses the tty of the environment
[20:32:50] <bfredl> puremourning: yea, it fits us pretty well as well
[20:33:38] <puremourning> ok it looks like a good shout. i'll read up on it thanks 
[20:33:45] <bfredl> happy to help :)
[20:34:01] <clason[m]> it even has nice Lua bindings :]
[20:34:10] <puremourning> ok then i'm out

[21:59:48] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> For the new global statusline available neovim dev, what do I need to do to have an optional lua setting to use it if the feature is available? Video example here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH5PNvJIa6o
[21:59:48] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> I know you use vim.fn.has("..."), but I never use this and don't know what to look for to check for that specific feature. There isn't a way to specify an nvim commit, is there? This isn't a vim patch. Is there somewhere that a specific feature is defined for this?
[21:59:48] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> If I set laststatus = 3 without this feature, the default is to be laststatus = 1 and not the default if you don't set the setting, which is 2. So I can't rely on just setting to to 3 and having it fall back gracefully.
[22:03:48] <sunjonSenghanBri> set it to 3 then check if it's 3?
[22:04:25] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> I tried that with nvim 0.6 and it still shows up as 3, or at least I think it does. `set laststatus=3` and then `set laststatus` still prints out 3.
[22:04:32] <clason[m]> > <@chipsenkbeil:matrix.org> For the new global statusline available neovim dev, what do I need to do to have an optional lua setting to use it if the feature is available?

[22:04:59] <clason[m]> Neovim does not have feature flags. People who insist on using nightlies (and more power to them!) should be expected to keep them updated.

[22:05:32] <ChipSenkbeil[m]> Not that I'd run into this myself, but if you do that, there's still the chance that you're on an older dev version of 0.7 that doesn't have the feature that it will fail, right? Based on your comment, I guess the standard practice is to keep dev up to date, as you said, so it's a moot point.
[22:05:32] <clason[m]> Once Neovim 0.7.0 is released, nightlies will become `0.8`.
