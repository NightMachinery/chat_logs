[03:22:57] <ash_worksi> but it basically says to set your configuration to g:ale_command_wrapper = my_script; where my_script runs `exec docker run -i --rm -v "$(pwd):/data" cytopia/pylint "$@"`

[12:12:46] <nikos[work]> Greetings. I'm trying to get autofs to work across containers (container->host or contaier->container) has anyone looked into this before?
[12:12:58] <nikos[work]> I guess the main problem here is if there's a way to disable mount namespaces on docker
[12:29:43] *** Joins: jonifen (~jonifen@user/jonifen)
[12:30:34] <cim> what do you mean by auto fs?
[12:31:26] <nikos[work]> the autofs filesystem: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/autofs.html aka automount
[12:32:16] <cim> oh, I already do this on a network volume
[12:32:29] <cim> auto mounted via fstab
[12:33:00] <nikos[work]> I'm trying to have automount run inside a container and propagate it via bind mounts to the host and other containers
[12:33:24] <nikos[work]> However while the mounts get propagated via --make-rshared accessing the autofs system from outside the container doesn't trigger an automount
[12:33:59] <nikos[work]> My assumption is that automount has to run on the root mount ns for it to work
[12:35:16] <cim> well yeah, /etc/fstab is owned by root and only root
[12:35:55] <nikos[work]> It's not related to fstab, it's a separate daemon 'automount' that manages the mount/unmount.

[13:26:05] <nikos[work]> akik: My test environment is already on a privileged container and the mount is marked as rshared. 
[13:26:49] <cim> mine didn't need special privs to work

[20:28:29] <SuperCoolNinja> Hi, In  a docker compose file, can I have different dependsOn based on a given Conditional Var setting? 
[20:30:49] <programmerq> SuperCoolNinja▸ you could use an environment variable substitution and set it that way: https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#substitute-environment-variables-in-compose-files
[20:32:30] <SuperCoolNinja> Yes, I was wondering if the dependsOn section in the docker compose file can be somehow dynamic, based on env Var.
[20:33:01] <SuperCoolNinja> instead of creating a different service each possible env.

[20:33:41] <programmerq> you'd simply export the variable and compose will sub in the value. it's a simple substitution. any "dynamic" way to set those would be handled before compose gets called.

[21:25:18] <endigma> have you tried just reading the --help?
[21:25:23] <escherial> same; i'm sure 1.27 and 1.29 aren't so different
[21:25:41] <endigma> i mean it's still docker-compose for me
[21:25:46] <escherial> endigma: i have; there's a flag --no-start that sounds like it would do what i'm seeing, but i'm not specifying it when i run docker compose up
[21:25:52] <endigma> `docker compose` isn't a thing
[21:26:02] <endigma> you're running like docker-compose up -d?
[21:26:08] <endigma> or `docker compose up -d`?
[21:26:17] <escherial> endigma: "docker compose" was recently-ish introduced
[21:26:38] <escherial> that's the point of my question, that i'm seeing different behavior between "docker-compose" and the new "docker compose" that i don't see documented anywhere
[21:26:57] <escherial> even though the docs claim it's a drop-in replacement that will eventually replace "docker-compose"
[21:27:21] <ada_> escherial: the interfaces are not exactly the same and it's still in development
[21:27:30] <ada_> escherial: not surprised that the docs are not completely up to date yet
[21:27:48] <endigma> just switch to kubernetes it's probably simpler
[21:27:58] <endigma> :)
[21:28:05] <escherial> endigma: i've tried both; docker-compose up -d myservice has the behavior i expect, i.e. that it actually starts services that myservice has in its depends_on block. docker compose up -d myservice (the new version) just creates the dependent services, but doesn't *start* them

[21:28:17] <escherial> i mean, sure, whatever; i could just stick with docker-compose and everything would be fine
[21:28:26] <escherial> ada_: aha
[21:28:46] <escherial> i don't know, this seems like a pretty big thing to not mention in the updated docs or to make the same between the two
[21:28:51] <ada_> escherial: the "up" command is intended to be used to bring up the whole stack, not a single service
[21:29:04] <ada_> escherial: it "works" to bring up a single service, but it may have side effects
[21:29:34] <ada_> escherial: docker-compose has a "run" command that's intended to be used for running a single service out of the stack
[21:29:45] <escherial> ok, but in what world do you want your services to be created, but not started?
[21:30:00] <ada_> I can't really answer that
[21:30:06] <escherial> fair enough, thanks
[21:30:11] <ada_> use "up" when you want the whole stack
[21:31:18] <escherial> i mean, there is a valid use case for "up" to bring up a specific service and its dependent services, i.e. when you want to run it with service ports, etc. enabled but not to be attached to it as you would with "run"
[21:31:23] <escherial>  for reference i've been docker-compose for the last three years, so i'm not exactly new to it
[21:32:44] <escherial> but yeah, i accept that "docker compose" is new and that it's not yet reached feature parity with the old command
