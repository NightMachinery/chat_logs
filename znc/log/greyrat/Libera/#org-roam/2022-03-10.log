[17:57:10] <Edmund[m]> <petrichor> "Oh, is there an org-mode space..." <- Yeah, I made one a while ago, I'm not too active in org-roam myself, but I'm trying to get matrix adopted wherever I can. Invite link, and anyone in charge feel free to DM me for admin rights. https://matrix.to/#/#org-roam:matrix.org 
[20:14:32] <AadVersteden[m]> Edmund: Could you help me understand a few concepts then?  I want to set some stuff up for the Linked Data world but I don't think I fully understand Matrix.  That's terrible when you think of it but much probably is due to my lack of finding or reading the right resources.
[21:47:34] <Edmund[m]> <AadVersteden[m]> "Edmund: Could you help me..." <- Of course! What do you think your missing?
[21:57:56] <Edmund[m]> https://matrix.org/bridges/ This might be a good place to start
