[03:14:25] <tomreyn> DXVK is https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk
[03:14:43] <Khepra> tomreyn: steam itself works, but whether the games will depends on your gpu , mesa bugs, kernel firmware bugs

[03:15:56] <tomreyn> yes, of course. it'll be partial coverage at best, i just wanted to get an idea of whether there is much of a difference in the coverage on debian vs. other distros with those extra layers.
[03:15:59] <Aarch64debian> 5.15?
[03:16:28] <Khepra> and I found out the performance of linux native games sucks. their windows versions, played through proton, is much.... much.... much better experience.  from what I've read, linux+opengl is terrible for perofmance. vulkan native games will work fine, otherwise select directx11 windows version
[03:16:37] *** Quits: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[03:17:14] <Khepra> tomreyn: well debian is stuck with buggy mesa atm. there's some games bugfixes with newer mesa
[03:17:23] <greycat> as you can see, there are no prebuilt 5.15 kernels in Debian yet; you can build your own if you like
[03:17:58] <tomreyn> Khepra: mesa's buggy how?
[03:18:04] <Khepra> glitches
[03:18:17] <Khepra> if you read the mesa changelogs you'll see each point release includes bugfixes for various gamess
[03:18:50] <tomreyn> that is certainly no different for directx ;)
[03:19:04] <Khepra> for example, Euro Truck Simulator 2... completely unplayable with stock mesa. artifacts galore. bumped to 21.2.4 (and newer) and the glitches were gone
[03:20:23] <tomreyn> these 'fixes for game X' commits make me wonder whether the middleware is making things work with buggy game X or game X is actually fine and it's the middlewares' fault.

[03:21:53] <Khepra> there were some issues with borderlands 3 and missing codec so you couldn't see in-game vids, which prevented the story from progressing, but I think that's fixed in the 6.x series of Proton
[03:21:57] <tomreyn> yes, it's really impressive what they achieved there
[03:22:17] <Khepra> dunno, haven't re-played it since I had to use github'ed patches for 5.x series last year
[03:22:42] <tomreyn> and there are reports of native windows games running faster and better on linux through tthis translation layer
[03:23:11] <Khepra> I think proton is working so well, nobody's gonna be bothered with linux native ports. the "traditional" publishers surely won't. there's no linux native for xcom:chymera squad, firaxis gave up
[03:23:31] <tomreyn> *that* is the sad part about it
[03:23:58] <Khepra> tomreyn: I' think I've seen that with Doom. There's a section with Vega near the end that had choppy FPS on windows native, on teh same machine I re-tried with proton that had smooth FPS. but that was nvidia gpu. Now I has this amdgpu and the story's the opposite.

[03:25:09] <Khepra> "Go FOSS" they said. Use AMDgpu, they've grown so much better recently, they said.    Pfffffft. If I knew, I wouldn't bother with 1000€ gpu, I'd bother with 1500€ and get latest possible 3090

[03:27:27] <Khepra> yeah I'm hoping the bad perf here is due to this being so new even amd doesn't have fully clean code for it. and that in time firmware + kernel support would take it the other way and make it better.

[14:29:41] <bastelfreak> if I throw keys into /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/, apt will use any matching key for my repo.

[16:00:02] <Khepra> computerworm110: because doas is not drop-in replacement for sudo
[16:00:13] <amacater_> computerworm10 - doas is being considered as a possble alternative to sudo in Debian but isn't there yet.
[16:00:27] <computerworm110> Then how come I can use KDE Plasma without sudo in Arch?
[16:00:37] <amacater_> Different distributions do things different ways - Arh is slightly more "build it yourself", maybe
[16:00:50] <amacater_> Every distribution has its own policies
[16:01:22] <Khepra> well to answer _this_ particular question, one has to track down how KDE is using sudo
[16:01:29] <jelly> also, someone needs to do the work
[16:01:38] <jelly> someone in arch did the work, apparently
[16:01:50] <Khepra> if I'd hazard a guess, I'd say KDE doesn't directly (because dbus polkit something something), but maybe a dependency does
[16:01:56] <computerworm110> Okay, so the exact chain of dependency in Debian is thus: plasma-desktop depends on kde-cli-tools, which depends on libkf5su5 which depends on sudo.
[16:02:20] <amacater_> I suspect that sudo is pulled in by most large desktop environments somewhere along the line eventually ...
[16:02:49] <Khepra> ,i libkf5su5
[16:02:51] <judd> Package libkf5su5 (libs, optional) in bullseye/amd64: Integration with su for elevated privileges.. Version: 5.78.0-2; Size: 30.5k; Installed: 102k; Homepage: https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kdesu
[16:03:10] <Khepra> ah kdesu... desu desu ka!
[16:03:42] <Khepra> so I think the better question is: how come arch's KDE implementation doesn't. maybe it's crippled?
[16:03:51] <amacater_> So - it may be that plasma-desktop is a "full kde" and there may be smaller metapackages available
[16:04:43] <amacater_> It's quite possible that you could install plasma-desktop, remove sudo (which will remove the metapackage) and install doas
[16:04:55] <computerworm110> No, it's not crippled. It works exactly the way the Plasma developers coded it to. Arch keeps everything very faithful to upstream.

[16:06:11] <dpkg> hmm... arch is a hardware architecture (i386, amd64, armel, mips, mipsel, sparc, powerpc, alpha, hppa, s390 && ia64).  Also a source control revision system (GNU arch).  Arch (and its twin brother ArX) resides at http://arch.fifthvision.net/, or http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5928, or #arch  Since lenny, /bin/arch has disappeared, use "uname -m" instead, or <architecture>, or <arch linux>.

[16:07:07] <jelly> arguably if it's just a default the dependency might be demoted to Recommends
[16:07:08] <Khepra> as you can see, it can be built to use doas, but doas is not a drop in replacement for sudo and can't be switched to without halfa ecosystem collapsing into rubble
[16:07:09] <amacater_> khepra: In which case, that makes sense because not everybody uses su - to become root and sudo is a valid choice
[16:07:14] <computerworm110> And the reason I'm asking this question is that a few months ago I installed KDE Plasma on Debian, and I then installed doas and uninstalled sudo and when I uninstalled sudo, all of KDE went with it.

[22:17:02] <blinux> So, my dad was just using Debian 11 with Plasma desktop. I was trying to get him to use Linux because the Windows is really slow and annoying. He went to check his Gmail in Brave browser and the whole PC become non-responsive and and we had to cut the power and reboot. He said "So far I'm not liking Linux". So, this was not a good experience. I've
[22:17:03] <blinux> read that Plasma desktop could be buggy. I've read posts saying that Plasma crashes all the time for people in Kubuntu, but not Arch. I'm not sure why. But, I'm thinking for Debian maybe Plasma is not a good choice at the very least. Or, for reliability another desktop should be used.

[22:24:09] <Khepra> linux desktop sucks. osx is way better choice for a non-programmer
[22:24:11] <casionaut> In my installation there seems to be 5 input methods installed, ibus,fcitx,uim,thai and xim. I think I don't need anything other than ibus, how can I safely remove the other ones?
[22:24:15] <acidtonic> is swap file located *inside* an encrypted disk partition?
[22:24:17] <blinux> I'm pretty bad at reading logs / journals. I've never really found anything, or know which file to check.
[22:24:24] <blinux> There is no encrypted disk partition used.
[22:24:47] <amacater_> It doesn't have to be indexing email - it could be indexing anything ... I forget which program likes indexing everything on the system
[22:24:47] <Khepra> blinux: journalctl command will show the contents of unified event log, journald
[22:25:03] <Khepra> amacater_: akonadi?
[22:25:06] <acidtonic> I've had swap inside dm-crypt partition fail on oom because the encryption-layer mallocs can fail and re-trigger the same swap code which just hit dm-crypt and memory faulted... (the recursive looping of this is not fixed or documented and it wont' oom but runs slow)
[22:25:14] <amacater_> Khepra - yes
[22:26:07] <blinux> OK, I got the journalctl open and showing todays data.
[22:27:06] <Khepra> blinux: if oyu know when the crash happened, oyu could narrow it down with --since and --until flags for journalctl
[22:27:14] <jelly> acidtonic, there's some tuning to try avoid situations like that; vm.min_free_kbytes = 524288
[22:27:33] <jelly> doesn't fix the issue but makes it happen less often
[22:28:21] <blinux> I think it may have happened around 13:38 and it is 13:57 now. There is nothing after 13:38 either. I see this line stands out: Failed to get application states: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.portal.Error.Failed: Could not get window list
[22:28:26] <jelly> of course the best solution is fix the workload to use less RAM, or buy more RAM
[22:28:31] <acidtonic> jelly, agree, I personally want to re-write the mallocs inside dm-crypt to all happen at boot/mount time and then reuse memory to avoid needing malloc during memory pressure
[22:29:00] <jelly> blinux, does this system use nvidia closed driver by chance?
[22:29:06] <blinux> jelly, XFCE may use less RAM, also one user logged in at a time. I know XFCE has lower RAM requirements, though not sure if it uses less.
[22:29:24] <blinux> jelly, NO, there is no Nvidia in this. It is an AMD with Radeon graphics.

[22:33:41] <Khepra> if you were a factorio player, you'd know that any kind of buffering via tanks (which zram technically is, "faking" free space by compression)  is just a temporary delay before the whole system collapses out of resources :)
[22:33:43] <amacater_> RAM requirements only increase - see also the person wanting to use a 15+ year old laptop with 512M of memory
[22:33:51] <jelly> Khepra, 8GB RAM + 3x4GB zram swap made my plasma and chrome and firefox usable

[22:34:20] <acidtonic> isn't compressed pages almost the same thing?
[22:34:27] <Khepra> almost
[22:34:35] <jelly> Khepra, swap on SSD is unusably slow
[22:34:52] <jelly> latencies are important.

[22:35:15] <Khepra> randall: indeed :)  more ram must be downloaded :)
[22:35:57] <jelly> swap on zram makes it look like you actually have double the RAM, and there's some UI lagging

[22:36:26] <jelly> swap on SSD makes everything hung for MINUTES when ram+swap gets filled up
[22:36:57] <jelly> it's faster to push the button and reboot and restart everything, than to wait for OOM to find its way
[22:37:11] <blinux> jelly, OK, I'll try atop. I may also need to switch to XFCE or another desktop.,

[22:37:30] <Khepra> that would imply a swapstorm, which means pages kernel thought were inactive are actually needed as active short time later, and rinse and repeat
[22:37:40] <jelly> and "GUI hangs and nothing works" is one symptom of that
[22:37:45] <Khepra> zram could temporarily save the situation but ain't a solution
[22:37:49] <blinux> jelly, If I did run out of RAM, I still would hope the system would not have gone non-responsive.

[22:38:07] <jelly> Khepra, it is a solution if you just need a couple more GB

[22:38:42] <blinux> I'm running atop now and it looks like htop. So, atop is running all the time automatically? I don't have to set anything?
[22:38:50] <Khepra> could also increase swappiness so it pages OUT more aggressively. counter intuitively maybe but that would actually page out stuff that kernel things is active, but aint' really. worse thing, you dial it back to 60
[22:39:00] <jelly> blinux, atop has two modes, one is interactive and realtime (try it!), and one is "read from logs and replay/step time"

[22:39:27] <blinux> jelly, OK, I guess i will have to tell it to read from logs if it crashes and I'll check the man page and hopefully it will be easy.
[22:39:36] <jelly> Khepra, 60 is too aggressive already but I confess I have not tried that.
[22:39:57] <Khepra> and it can go up to ele^W 200, so... :)   I mean... try... see if helps... dial back if it doesn't.
[22:40:08] <jelly> zram+swap works so well I considered using it on servers
[22:40:09] <Khepra> especially with zram
[22:40:37] <jelly> right now I use "restart leaky service when it eats too much"
[22:40:57] * Khepra uses zswap on servers
[22:41:19] <jelly> zswap is more predictable in latency, but worse with compression
[22:41:54] * Khepra doesn't have OOM situations and compression is really for inactive pages, and delaying as much as possible before spinning rust is hit; not to iron out a swapstorm.
