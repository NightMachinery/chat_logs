[06:19:17] <fier> hey everyone. i'm a bit stumped, trying to get the lowest delay humanly possible with ffplay.
[06:20:04] <fier> i'm using a bunch of flags already to get it pretty low, but some user input is required (pressing right arrow in the ffplay window) to get the stream *really* low delay.
[06:21:10] <fier> this is my current commandline: ffplay -avioflags direct -threads 1 -analyzeduration 0 -probesize 32 -max_probe_packets 1 -packetsize 1 -sync ext -fflags +nobuffer+fastseek+discardcorrupt+nofillin+flush_packets -flags low_delay -framedrop -i -
[06:23:14] <fier> if i press right arrow a bunch of times, i sometimes get lucky and it's super low delay. i can then press space for a short time to add back a little more delay for framepacing/audio consistency. the issue is that i'd like to abstract this away for users.
[06:27:41] <fier> i'm basically looking to have that M-A value in the terminal hover around a certain value?

[08:52:32] <ffmpeg_question> Hello, I'm trying to embed some subtitles into a .mp4 file but having problems with it changing the length of the file
[08:52:56] <ffmpeg_question> I've tried -shortest along with -fflags +shortest and -max_interleave_delta 100M
[08:54:01] <ffmpeg_question> these seem to work but if the subtitle is shorter than the video it ends up cutting off the video
[08:54:41] <ffmpeg_question> I'm hoping there's some option I missed that essentialy sets -t to the length of the first stream in the file
[08:55:46] <ffmpeg_question> Also I tried to do this manually in a batch file and for my specific file, adding .2 seconds to the -t command made the file over 2 seconds longer even if I set it using milliseconds
[08:56:34] <ffmpeg_question> ex. -t 1463000ms produces a file that is 24m23s, but -t 1463221ms produces a file that is 24m25s long
[08:57:11] <fier> the time thing could be due to keyframes or something, if you don't re-encode the video, it could be that you can't set an exact length
[08:57:38] <ffmpeg_question> I'm not sure if that's related except that it seems like a bug and stops that approch working.
[08:57:50] <ffmpeg_question> The video stream is only 24m23s though?
[08:58:07] <ffmpeg_question> I am only remuxing it, not re-encoding though like you say
[08:59:06] <fier> i'm thinking, if the subtitles are shorter than your video, you probably don't wanna use -shortest, but i unfortunately never messed with subtitles myself before, i could be wrong.
[08:59:51] <ffmpeg_question> yeah, -shortest seemed to work but that's the issue that sometimes the subs are shorter cutting off the video
[09:00:18] <ffmpeg_question> messing with max_interleave_delta just seemed to be a good way to break the file entirely
[09:00:32] <fier> it might be a good idea to get how many frames your video has, and to set the video length in frames.. there was a way to do it but i don't exactly remember
[09:00:54] <ffmpeg_question> hmm
[09:01:01] <ffmpeg_question> that might be automatable with ffprobe
[09:01:16] <fier> it can output json if i remember right
[09:02:47] <fier> i suppose i would analyze the video's length, not use -shortest, and then set the length of the output file according to the video
[09:03:57] <fier> or maybe you can compare both the length of the video and the subtitles, and decide depending on that if you wanna use -shortest or not
[09:04:10] <fier> that might be safer
[09:04:11] <ffmpeg_question> yeah that's what I was trying when I ran into -t not setting the time properly. I'm gonna try frames right now since that seems more precise
[09:04:26] <fier> good luck
[09:14:09] <ffmpeg_question> I don't think you can do frames w/o re-encoding the file
[09:14:37] <ffmpeg_question> or at least not when doing -vf select=(0,[frame I want to end on])
[09:17:47] <ffmpeg_question> I think you're also right about -t jumping to keyframes when you're copying the stream, but that doesn't explain times past the end of the video stream..?
[09:20:20] <ffmpeg_question> is there a way to just drop any subtitle entries after a specific time code?

[17:36:09] <vlt> Hello. To check the resulting quality first I encoded a video only file with "-crf 28 -preset veryfast ...mp4", then finally with "-crf 28 -preset veryslow ...mp4". How can the latter file be larger in size than the former?
[17:38:42] <DHE> that can happen. encoder features are turned on/off and it can have all sorts of effects
[17:38:57] <another|> crf is not the same across various presets
[17:39:52] <vlt> Thank you. Should the visual quality at least be the same?
[17:40:11] <furq> no

[21:34:52] <sept> Hi. I was curious about i-frames rates. If your video stream has 30 fps, do i-frames usually occur every x multiple of 30? Ex: every 6 frames, or 15 frames? I imagine this depends on many factors, but I wanted to know in general. How does Youtube or Twitch do this?
[21:35:31] <kepstin> sept: there's too many variations to make any generalizations
[21:35:58] <kepstin> sept: but in most codecs, keyframe interval (or gop size) is configurable, so it's "whatever you set it to"
[21:36:01] <sept> kepstin: What about for streaming live video?
[21:36:08] <BtbN> Twitch uses hls. So it recommends a GOP length that perfectly fits a hls segment.
[21:36:15] <kepstin> depends on the streaming method used
[21:36:19] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Quit: WeeChat 3.3)
[21:36:48] <kepstin> for segmented streaming like HLS or DASH, short gop size based on fixed time is desirable (with constant framerate, a fixed number of frames)
[21:37:52] <kepstin> that's specific to broadcast streaming, where you want people to be able to join the stream at any point
[21:38:45] <kepstin> some other things, like certain types of video conferencing streaming, will actually use fairly large keyframe interval to reduce bandwidth, but manually request keyframes when new people join so they can start the video quickly.
[21:41:18] <sept> BtbN & kepstin: Interesting information. This gives me stuff to research. Thanks! There really are many factors. It never occurred to me that video conferencing vs. a more passive streaming like Twitch actually require different approaches.
[21:42:06] <sept> That's why Twitch is so bad at video conferencing I guess. I've seen many streams where the audio lag is ridiculous.
[21:42:32] <BtbN> If a stream has audio desync, that has literally nothing to do with gop length.
[21:42:58] <kepstin> twitch in ultra low latency mode is pretty good, but there's only so much you can do when you're optimizing for broadcast applications with very large viewer count.
[21:44:46] <sept> BtbN: I'm totally unqualified to comment about this, but I noticed that when Twitch streamers try to use Twitch streams for video conferencing, while, I guess using Discord for audio, the lag is absurd. Like several seconds. I guess they are forced to do that to get the image too. I don't know.
[21:45:30] <sept> Other times, they get video conferencing to work fine. I don't really understand.
[21:45:30] <BtbN> What even is "Twitch for video conferencing"? It's not a feature it has.
[21:45:32] <bencoh> Well, if you use discord for audio and twitch for video, then it'd obviously get out of sync
[21:46:15] <sept> bencoh: Yes of course. But they must have a reason to do it so badly. Like they don't have a choice, so they do that.
[21:46:41] <sept> If they decide to do it without any prep maybe they are forced to do it that way.
[21:47:21] <sept> They talk about stream keys. So that is the "prep" part.
[21:48:20] <sept> Anyways. That gives me stuff to investigate. Much appreciated.
[21:50:27] <bencoh> kepstin: btw do you have any such videoconf streaming protocol with keyframe request support in mind?
[21:50:52] <BtbN> I have literally never seen or heard of anyone trying to do a video conference using Twitch
[21:50:55] <kepstin> i've used kurento in sfu mode for webrtc, which i think supports that.
[21:50:59] <BtbN> you seem to be severely misunderstanding something
[21:51:51] <sept> BtbN: Again, I'm out of my depth. What I have noticed is that they require everyone's "stream key" in order to have everyone in a "Twitch conference call".
[21:52:12] <bencoh> kepstin: oh, looks like it's opensource even (?)
[21:52:12] <BtbN> Who is "they"?
[21:52:21] <BtbN> You mean restreams?
[21:52:23] <sept> BtbN: Streamers
[21:52:37] <BtbN> I've seen and worked with a ton of streamers. Literally none of them done that.
[21:52:39] <sept> BtbN: Like when they do a collab.
[21:52:47] <BtbN> Why would they not just do a Discord Call?
[21:53:17] <BtbN> And why would they need someone elses Stream Key? Those are quite sensitive data.
[21:53:19] <sept> BtbN: So they can broadcast it on many channels and the audio is in sync? Again, I'm only speculating. I don't really know.
[21:53:46] <BtbN> That doesn't make any sense, and I've literally never seen anyone do something like that.
[21:54:02] <kepstin> my guess is that this is an odd setup where people are all streaming to a single person who combines the streams then broadcasts to twitch.
[21:54:17] <kepstin> which i have seen - very rarely - for certain types of remote collab streams.
[21:54:33] <BtbN> Restream-Setups for something like Speedrun-Events are common. But you do not video conference and interact between those.
[21:54:43] <sept> Exactly. Like Ludwig's "Hive Mind" game show.
[21:54:50] <BtbN> You have commentators watching and talking over the other streams.
[21:54:59] <BtbN> It's straight up impossible to have a conversation that way.
[21:55:27] <kepstin> any sort of conference being broadcast would be a conference that's managed outside of twitch, then the result broadcast to twitch
[21:55:53] <kepstin> an a/v desync could be introduced in a variety of places in such a setup, it's hard to say more without details
[21:56:33] <sept> All I know is that one of the streamers mentioned they had to give their "stream key" to, presumably, the producers of the gameshow.
[21:56:43] <BtbN> That makes no sense
[21:56:52] <BtbN> that would enable the producer to stream to that persons channel. Nothing else.
[21:57:07] <BtbN> It does not give magic access to the stream or anything
[21:58:13] <sept> BtbN: That makes perfect sense. Just like you said: "that would enable the producer to stream to that persons channel".
[21:58:40] <BtbN> No, it directly contradicts what you're suggesting.
[21:58:49] <sept> Which is?
[21:59:02] <BtbN> That they're video conferencing via Twitch, which is the opposite way around.

[22:41:06] <DHE> (off topic) the whole point of using UDP was to re-implement TCP congestion control "smarter". which is still baffling because google also made their own TCP congestion control driver for linux which got merged into the kernel. so, why?
[22:41:41] <BtbN> http/2 itself is already very dubious in implementation quality
[22:41:51] <BtbN> it puts SO MUCH complexity into both server and client, it's insane

[22:52:59] <sept> So, I did a search for "websockets" on this page: http://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-protocols.html and it came back empty. So, you do not have the option of using the websocket protocol with libavformat then?
[22:53:37] <sept> It's not useful enough in streaming video?
[22:53:46] <sept> of efficient enough.
[22:53:47] <JEEB> nobody cared to implement it if they're utilizing it
[22:53:57] <JEEB> after all, API users can just do their own IO
[22:54:05] <JEEB> see: AVIOContext
[22:54:29] <JEEB> and on the other hand, why would you do websockets if you're not limited by XMLHTTPRequest?
[22:54:40] <JEEB> because you can just do an unlimited PUT or POST
[22:54:47] <JEEB> data streaming and all that jazz
[22:55:59] <sept> JEEB: so you're saying that websockets does not give enough of a bandwidth advantage for video streaming, so that's why nobody cared to implement it?
[22:56:21] <sept> Or latency advantage.
[22:56:56] <BtbN> How would it possibly give a latency advantage?
[22:57:03] <BtbN> It's just another layer of abstraction over http
[22:57:05] <JEEB> as far as I know why browser based solutions utilize websockets between a media server and the browser client is because XHR buffers everything
[22:57:21] <JEEB> and as soon as you utilize something else (such as websockets) it will not
[22:57:40] <JEEB> it is a choice based on web browser limitations, *not* HTTP limitations or TCP limitations
[22:58:03] <sept> Ok, thanks.
[22:58:06] <JEEB> heck, in ye olden 2009 I did TV streaming from a VLC http sout end point from Japan and watched it here in Finland :P
[22:58:11] <BtbN> It's also by no means standardized
[22:58:13] <JEEB> you don't need websockets to get a streaming thing
[22:58:20] <BtbN> so there is no generic "video over websocket" protocol ffmpeg could implement
[22:58:24] <JEEB> yea
[22:58:50] <JEEB> and what people utilize, FFmpeg does not require websockets for that use case since it does not do what XHR does
[22:58:57] <JEEB> (which is to buffer the whole request)
[22:59:44] <JEEB> because with XHR you can get chunk results which you can parse, but the underlying thing *will* buffer the whole thing. that is the only reason why people using browser as a client try to utilize something else
[23:00:25] <JEEB> people invent their solutions to work around problems in their platforms, after all.
