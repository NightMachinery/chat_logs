[00:00:34] <hayley> Right, time to hack delta coding now that I figured out how to do it without object layouts.
[00:04:37] <ln43> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_encoding <- this one ?
[00:07:38] *** Joins: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv)
[00:09:59] <hayley> Yes.
[00:10:35] <hayley> Though, rather than doing a difference with the last value, I'm doing a difference with the address of the word being written.
[00:13:44] * hayley now struggles with C types again.
[00:14:18] <ln43> ok, but are you developing also the error control codes?
[00:14:26] <hayley> I'm literally rewriting pointers, I don't think any type safety actually helps here.
[00:15:07] <hayley> No error coding here.
[00:15:39] <ln43> yes, ok...
[00:23:14] <hayley> Hm, empty SBCL isn't noticeably larger (still 12MB) with delta coding, but I messed up my decoder and have to re-compile.
[00:24:51] *** Quits: ln43 (~ln43@user/ln43) (Quit: Connection closed)
[00:25:08] <selwyn> is this to make it fit in a cache
[00:25:28] <hayley> It's to make smaller images.
[00:25:46] <selwyn> but why do that
[00:25:53] <hayley> It all gets decompressed before you can use it, as usual.
[00:26:02] <hayley> To test a theory I have about pointer distances.
[00:26:11] <selwyn> cool
[00:27:00] <hayley> The SBCL GC lines up cons cells in a list, so the pointer distance of a CDR of a cell in a list is a single word.
[00:27:42] <drakonis> is there any reasonable way to follow the latest common lisp happenings?
[00:28:06] <hayley> Most are within 20 bits per <https://twitter.com/nodefunallowed/status/1473450260739477506/photo/1>. So hopefully delta coding gives more for zstd to play with.

[00:49:06] <drakonis> there's also https://sic.pm/ which is lobsters but enhanced
[00:49:32] <selwyn> i think there is a lisp imageboard

[05:25:11] -ixelp- OpenBSD: Innovations
[05:25:59] <epony> in OpenBSD is enabled and non-optional and made to work with force and complete system propagation up to applications and their upstream vendors
[05:26:32] <epony> which will save you from disasters on/off the job in the commercial sector later in life
[05:26:49] <moon-child> imagine having to write mitigations for flaws in unsafe languages
[05:26:56] <epony> well
[05:27:14] <epony> couple that with endiannes variations and platform bugs
[05:28:45] <epony> now add legacy 25 year-long selection of important faults on various arches, and machine dependent and independent separation and platform unification work while retaitining standards and other BSD portability
[05:28:56] <hayley> I've only had endianness bugs once.
[05:29:10] <epony> I'm a x86 noob.
[05:29:46] <hayley> Someone's Smalltalk system didn't bother to flip endianness from big endian to little endian, instead they converted the image to little endian, and made changes to it. Then I had to convert it back to big endian to port to the Wii.
[05:30:00] <epony> cool
[05:30:01] <hayley> I'd much rather they just converted while loading the image.
[05:30:39] <epony> reusing various obscure and popular compures for lang work is quite nice way to go about them
[05:32:01] <epony> in that category of work, NetBSD has decent track record for porting the system and (cr)applications
[05:32:49] <epony> and there are retro-(gaming/compute) club peolpe interested in using it as part of their toolkits
[05:33:28] <hayley> Apparently Xerox gave the instructions to flip endianness in the image, which is weird, since you'd expect that to be portable too. But maybe they just didn't think people had the memory for it? I don't think you can operate directly off the image still.
[05:33:44] <epony> which is a more nichey thing than say embedded Linux (Minix also appreciates pkgsrs (the ports repo) from NetBSD)
[05:34:20] <epony> interesting plats were m68k and some smaller like the legacy vax32
[05:36:05] <epony> I think FreeBSD and Linux mainstream has focused on LLVM/Clang-ification and narrow sub-set more modern 64bit plats only, while OpenBSD keeps more of them alive (despite converting from GNU to LLVM too) and NetBSD the most with some untested cross-compilation upkeep work
[05:36:39] <epony> specifically in the interest of "bug" nailing and testing category of work (obsd)
[05:37:02] <epony> and testing that new techniques work on varying older machines too
[05:37:27] <epony> with smaller overhead than say just slapping the "hardening patchkit" for Gentoo or Debian
[05:38:56] <epony> so that balance of the lower percentage of deterioration of performance for memory / bug class elimination work is.. useful and goes on to fix monsters like app VMs and notably Firefox and Chromium
[05:41:43] <epony> a nice overview of application porting and "platform"(isation) progress is checking and cross referencing implementations between programming languages modules / libraries, and runtimes (and libraries) from software vendors, and specific application carries like emacs, and perl
[05:43:06] <epony> or in other systems the equivalent of http://man.openbsd.org/portgen.1 for managing their packages / modules from the system package toolkits
[05:43:07] -ixelp- portgen(1) - OpenBSD manual pages
[05:44:12] <epony> (OpenBSD uses a set of Perl framworks for the ports tree and package management, FreeBSD is ruby last time I was interested.. and NetBSD I think is less integrated in the system)
[05:44:37] <epony> Redhat (RPM) ones are pythonified
[05:45:19] <epony> Gentoo portage is interesting and FreeBSD ports collection is much larger (but OpenBSD's is top freshness)
[05:46:20] <epony> I personally like the systems that have the larger language categories and package management "survivability" long-term support
[05:47:21] <epony> so, I knew about zig and other recent additions ;-)

[06:13:02] <epony> the real problem with app-VMs is.. you can't debug into it, you have to rely on "self" for that as the VM lacks tooling and is not POSIX internally so nothing is as it would be with tooling from the host OS missing and the link severed
[06:13:30] <epony> you can't work with processes and memory management of the system and you can'd debug and trace from the system
[06:14:00] <epony> (in short: "man working in sanitation has shitty outlook on life" --Confusius)
[06:14:15] <hayley> Not complaining, having used gdb.
[06:14:19] <epony> yeah
[06:14:59] <epony> but, the system tracing (not gdb/lldb) but strace / ktrace / ltrace / btrace / dtrace etc are a serious tool
[06:15:13] <epony> which you don't get in the app-vm
[06:15:23] <epony> you get the jvm immitaion of it
[06:16:20] <hayley> Still agree to disagree. Once I had to figure out why I couldn't connect to my email server. It'd be a matter of tracing a few functions in Lisp, but I'd have to find the tools for watching firewalls and packets and whatnot on Unix.
[06:16:36] <epony> so, in one scenario, your drag-on is the JVM (or whatever poison-ivy-app-VM you pick).. and in the other is the OS kernel and lang toolkits
[06:17:05] <epony> right, you just had "problems" with Linux

[13:13:13] * hayley twitches
[13:32:47] <moon-child> tbf assembly still 2-3x faster than the alternative in certain situations.  But yeah no discernible difference in whole-program perf
[13:32:49] <moon-child> praise ooo
[13:33:06] <hayley> sauce?
[13:33:48] <moon-child> quote was from the synthesis os dissertation
[13:34:24] <moon-child> sec. 7.4 I think
[13:35:21] * hayley tries to find a copy
[13:35:31] <hayley> http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.29.4871&rep=rep1&type=pdf
[13:35:55] <moon-child> https://web.archive.org/web/20140718044553im_/http://valerieaurora.org/synthesis/SynthesisOS/index.html  web version
[13:36:30] <hayley> Ah, now I remember this page.
[13:36:39] <moon-child> pdf seems to have been rasterized at low resolution--maybe low-quality convert from ps or something?--looks ugly
[13:37:36] <hayley> "But perhaps the biggest reason is that in 1984, at the time the seed ideas were being developed, I could not find a good, reliable (bug-free) C compiler for the 68000 processor. I had tried the compilers on several 68000-based Unix machines and repeatedly found that compilation was slow, that the compilers were buggy, that they produced terrible machine code, and that their runtime libraries were not reentrant. These qualities interfered with
[13:37:36] <hayley> my creativity and desire to experiment. Slow compilation dampens the enthusiasm of trying new ideas because the edit-compile-test cycle is lengthened. Buggy compilers makes it that much harder to write correct code. Poor code-generation makes my optimization efforts seem meaningless. And non-reentrant runtime libraries makes it harder to write a multithreaded kernel that can take advantage of multiprocessor architecture."
[13:37:39] <hayley> This guy speaks my language
[13:39:13] <amazigh> t
[13:39:22] <amazigh> that sounds good indeed
[13:40:50] <shka> well, this depends, for interactive language, like CL, 5 seconds for a single function is rather long but it does not hamper your work
[13:41:23] <hayley> s/guy/gal
[13:41:48] <shka> hayley: at this point you can simply use "bro"
[13:41:55] <Alfr> hayley, not really. What you just quoted sounds more like a rant about the state of compilers he found for that target. If I'm not mistaken you prefer to hack those instead.
[13:42:00] * hayley uploaded an image: (19KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/oWTmoFMOWUAsWMwUungEcLgh/bruhcha.jpg >
[13:42:07] <moon-child> shka: there is an extent to which it is not possible to develop operating systems interactively
[13:42:43] <hayley> Alfr: Well, I usually don't write buggy compilers that generate terrible machine code, and have runtimes that crap themselves with multiple threads.
[13:42:44] <moon-child> certain things, like drivers, can (of course) be so developed, given a sufficiently modular interface.  But other things are harder
[13:43:00] <hayley> Ditto for non-interactivity.
[13:43:04] <Alfr> hayley, though I'm not entirely sure what that paper is about, so I don't know whether he'll continue to present his better and more shiny compiler later on.
[13:43:27] <hayley> Alfr: None exists, as she was discussing writing straight 68k assembler.
[13:43:48] <moon-child> & ad-hoc code generators
[13:44:01] <moon-child> this is something that would work much better in a language like lisp where the compiler is available at run-time
[13:44:06] <Alfr> hayley, also, compilation has come a long way the last (almost) 50 years.
[13:44:08] <moon-child> and the whole approach smells a lot like jit
[13:44:28] <hayley> Alfr: 1984 + 50 = 2034, but sure.
[13:44:35] <Alfr> hayley, oh ... only 40, but still some time. :)
[13:45:05] <moon-child> my understanding is, there were good compilers at that point, but they were not available to consumers
[13:50:42] <shka> moon-child: that's something that eluded me
[13:53:46] <shka> moon-child: 80s hardware was pretty limited, especially in terms of memory 
[13:53:57] <shka> that's why visual studio compiler is what it is 
[13:54:26] <shka> at the time it was amazing that it even worked on such hardware 
[13:57:03] <shka> and lisp machines were outlier in this respect
[13:57:29] <shka> they were universally outfitted with a lot of RAM 
[13:58:01] <shka> amounts that were simply inconceivable for PC users  
[13:58:08] <shka> or Mac users
[13:58:15] <shka> or Amiga users

[13:59:52] * moon-child does not really get the big deal about gender.  Or why people care about it at all
[14:00:22] <shka> neither do i honestly 
[14:01:34] <hayley> moon-child: In the grand scheme of things, there is only <https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Egogender> and people duped into thinking otherwise
[14:01:34] <moon-child> wiki says cray-2 (1985) had 256 megawords of memory
[14:01:34] -ixelp- Egogender | Gender Wiki | Fandom
[14:01:52] <moon-child> doesn't say how big a word is.  But guessing 2 or 4 bytes.  So 0.5 or 1g.  That is a lot
[14:02:11] <hayley> It's also a Cray-2.
[14:02:58] <shka> moon-child: ok, that's plenty, and X-MP had 128 megabytes 
[14:03:44] <shka> hayley: yeah, cray-2 was not the most successful design
[14:04:50] <shka> and that beast was consuming 200 kW of power

[14:05:22] <moon-child> hayley: somehow, I'm sceptical of the quality of a webpage 'gender.fandom.com'.  Regardless, page refers to 'gender identity' which is the part that I don't get.  I feel like there is an implicit premise missing.  In what context is this a meaningful category at all?
[14:05:43] <hayley> It isn't.
[14:07:14] <moon-child> right.  So wherefore a name such as 'egogender' if it does not refer to a meaningful category?
[14:07:49] <hayley> But the idea of "egogender" is a hack, like that of Stirner's "creative nothing". The latter is either a crap translation, or meant like "no thing", i.e. something that cannot be named.
[14:10:24] <moon-child> ok
[14:10:31] <hayley> How do you name something that cannot be named? I guess "unique" sorta works, but the connotation doesn't fit somehow.
[14:11:28] <hayley> "They say of God, “Names name you not.” This is true of me: no concept expresses me, nothing that is said to be my essence exhausts me; they are only names."
[14:12:22] <moon-child> sounds like strong-sapir-whorf bullshit
[14:13:09] <hayley> I think it's just to drive home the idea that you shouldn't bother trying to pick labels.
[14:13:16] <moon-child> conflating concept with its name
[14:13:55] <moon-child> hayley: sure
[14:21:43] <hayley> The rest of The Unique and its Property perhaps is about how labelling makes things go to shit. You can now dehumanize people, since you have a vague idea of what a human should do. As you say, it's more the concept that does harm, but a name is needed to make a moralistic claim.
[14:22:06] <hayley> idk, I've mostly gotten away with not writing about my reading of some of the book.
[14:24:40] <moon-child>  some good writing by chomsky on the topic too
[14:24:43] <moon-child> if I can find it...
[14:25:05] <hayley> Without the name, you can only make stupid tautologies, e.g. "Something that works fourty hour weeks should work fourty hour weeks." "Yeah, and?" rather than "A citizen should work fourty hour weeks." ... or not, since you can just relate like "someone who uses our public facilities should give back, and work full time".
[14:26:58] <hayley> But a name helps you make unfounded assumptions and make emotional arguments IMO.
[14:29:58] <hayley> Unrelated: https://twitter.com/colinstrickland/status/1473945977379864577 I hope _your_ director of engineering isn't saying that computers are terrible. Can't imagine what value such a person would bring in, must be a whooooooole lot. /s

[15:24:10] <hayley> the sun is a deadly laser
[15:26:06] <hayley> But what about Gil Tene or Gilad Bracha, who also have gils?
[15:26:17] <gilberth> Yeah, right make fun of me. For what's it worth, I feel like a marshland, not a beach.
[15:26:28] * gilberth sips coffee.
[15:26:32] <selwyn> not a lovely german forest?
[15:27:21] <gilberth> selwyn: No, I am from the north. No forest, no mountains. All flat.
[15:27:21] <edgar-rft> we already logged most of our forests in the middle ages
[15:27:29] <hayley> gilberth: Would you attend the coffee compiler club? IIRC something like 8pm your time on Fridays.
[15:27:54] <selwyn> hm
[15:28:01] * hayley could be wrong, her timezone juggling is not sound w.r.t daylight savings.
[15:28:09] <selwyn> wondering what the defining national feature of britain is
[15:28:26] <gilberth> hayley: What is the Compiler Club? And why should I attend? And when in doubt use UTC.
[15:28:51] <edgar-rft> selwyn: british rain :-)
[15:28:52] <selwyn> it is probably the 'classic' woodland of the south
[15:29:07] <selwyn> even though there are lots of more exciting features
[15:29:31] <hayley> It is a club involving drinking coffee and talking about compiler hacking. There is Cliff Click, some other funny names, and some people that should be schooled on dynamic language implementation better.
[15:30:22] <selwyn> yes rain, but it is not so much rain as continuing to do stuff after it starts raining i.e. going to the beach for a day trip
[15:30:35] <gilberth> hayley: According to shka I don't qualify.
[15:30:43] <hayley> gilberth: 18:00 UTC. And I've asked someone else if they would consider attending, so you might have an accomplice.
[15:33:19] <gilberth> For you, it's middle of the night.
[15:33:36] <hayley> 03:00, yes. Hence why I'm asking you.
[15:34:09] <hayley> I asked beach, but it is too late for his taste.
[15:34:16] <edgar-rft> everybody cries about not loggin the brazilian rainforest but nobody talks about replanting the european forests that had been logged in the middle ages, what is a bit insincere
[15:34:36] <selwyn> well, iiuc european forest cover has actually recovered a lot
[15:34:37] <gilberth> hayley: Ah. Do you need a spy in there?
[15:35:03] <selwyn> which is a bright spot in fighting climate change
[15:35:15] <hayley> FWIW the conferences are made publicly available, and it's not all compiling per se. Some hardware hacking, some business founding talk, etc.
[15:35:40] <hayley> gilberth: More like someone to set a few of them straight. And you could talk about your regexen too.
[15:36:26] <edgar-rft> selwyn: you would need to demolish half of german cities to get enough room for the woods :-)
[15:36:39] <gilberth> hayley: I should give a talk? At what should I set straight? I am not a compiler expert as my hair is too long for that.
[15:37:12] <hayley> ^ average green party voter
[15:38:23] <hayley> Well, there's one guy who believes that dynamic languages can only use shitty GCs (e.g. CPython). But I also have too much hair and probably missed some other bullshit.
[15:38:27] <gilberth> egdar-rft: Not only Europe. The forests in the Middle East also was logged in ancient times.
[15:38:48] <selwyn> a significant part of the uk is made up of royal estates and grouse moors (areas dedicated to grouse shooting)
[15:38:56] <gilberth> hayley: Oh dear!
[15:39:01] <hayley> And there's no talks per se, they just ramble on about whatever is on the schedule for 2 hours total.
[15:39:15] <selwyn> there is a guy campaigning to rewild it, but he gets a lot of threats and intimidation
[15:39:26] <hayley> OTOH the last meeting discussed fancy Python and Ruby implementations with less lossage. So it depends.
[15:40:23] <edgar-rft> the main problem is that we have too many humans, having not enough forests is only the consequence
[15:40:41] <gilberth> hayley: So they believe that only because Python has a poor run time, dynamic languages must be slow?
[15:41:19] <selwyn> hm
[15:41:28] <selwyn> i wonder if wildlife can detect ionising radiation
[15:41:34] <hayley> Seems like it.
[15:41:48] <gilberth> It's about energy. Logging all the forest was not different from us now burning all the coal.
[15:42:16] <selwyn> perhaps thats why it can thrive in the chernobyl exclusion zone
[15:42:25] <hayley> Otherwise they are fairly well educated. But there's a lack of CL-ish compiler talk, I guess.
[15:42:31] <selwyn> they say that cats can detect electricity
[15:43:04] <edgar-rft> sharks definitely can
[15:43:21] <selwyn> gilberth: there is an idea that coal mining with steam engines was invented in england as a result of pressure due to deforestation reducing the wood supply
[15:43:33] <gilberth> hayley: Haven't I mentioned that I am tired of this war?
[15:43:51] <hayley> War is about education?
[15:43:52] <gilberth> selwyn: Makes perfect sense.
[15:44:40] <gilberth> hayley: Language wars. Fighting for GC. War on silly beliefs.
[15:44:50] <hayley> But still, they seem to not be stupid and so there's little of a war.
[15:44:59] <gilberth> Oops, I used the s-word.
[15:45:55] <hayley> There would be high standards. If someone said GC had annoying pauses, it's damn Cliff Click's meeting, that someone would embarrass themselves quickly.
[15:46:21] <gilberth> hayley: Anyhow, what makes you belief I would qualify?
[15:46:27] <hayley> It's more interesting, like what you do when you run out of memory bandwidth.
[15:46:57] <hayley> gilberth: CL hacker, not 03:00 for you, regex stuff with half a compiler bolted on, did embedded work...
[15:47:39] <hayley> Also, fairly odd opinions on boxing and JIT for a CL hacker, by my observation.
[15:48:02] <gilberth> Odd? My embedded work was boring. And there was no allocation at all. All static.
[15:49:32] <gilberth> Perhaps, but my ideas about boxing and JITing are just that: ideas. I have no experimental results what so ever.
[15:49:46] <hayley> I meant for CL with the latter stuff. But they can't assume you're an idiot if you had an elevator phone business.
[15:50:23] <gilberth> You belief so? Nah, that was very boring stuff.
[15:50:56] <hayley> Well, recall that the guy running the show made one of the most widely used JITs ever. But I guess now V8/Chrome is more common than HotSpot/JVM.
[15:51:17] <selwyn> gilberth: i don't think you would make a good academic
[15:51:24] <selwyn> trying to talk your way out of giving a presentation
[15:52:04] <gilberth> selwyn: Hmm. Perhaps I have changed.
[15:52:20] <hayley> And I sent an email on register allocation and inlining, but we were fine discussing hypotheticals.
[15:54:40] <hayley> Else I am not sure who to send. But just flick through the topics in a recent meeting...

[15:56:24] <gilberth> Ok.
[15:56:40] <gilberth> selwyn: You almost got me.
[15:59:06] <gilberth> hayley: Listen, I am in pretty bad shape still, just give me my time. Of course I could talk about RE submatch addressing, but I would need a lot more than 15min for that. Especially as I cannot assume people are accustomed to RE derivatives.
[16:00:15] <hayley> There's dispatch techniques, handling running out of memory, bailing out of JIT, concurrency, and iteration and primary memory compression to make caches happy.
[16:01:08] <hayley> gilberth: Sure. I mean, you don't have to talk about regexen, it was just a suggestion, what would be cool IMO is just having a Lisp hacker to exchange ideas.
[16:02:17] <gilberth> You're the SICL hacker. I am just a toy Lisp hacker.
[16:02:43] <hayley> Yet I cannot appear at 03:00 in the morning.
[16:03:15] * hayley off to bed at 23:30, just to make the point.
[16:04:31] <gilberth> A minor note: muLISP was funny. Remember it ran on an 8080 with just 64kB address space. Whenever you PUTD'ed (SETF FDEFINITION) the lambda would be converted to a CDR-coded form for less memory use and more speed while interpreting.
[16:05:03] <gilberth> hayley: Take care!

[18:09:52] <selwyn> porridge?
[18:10:30] <shka> well, typically instead of meat-and-potatoes you get meat-and-buckwheat 
[18:11:01] <shka> potatoes came to europe from america, back in the medieval times you ought to eat grains instead
[18:11:18] <selwyn> in ireland they had all sorts of dairy before potatoes
[18:11:21] <selwyn> completely different
[18:12:00] <shka> and i suspect that buckwheat, by virtue of growing on poor soil, could be widespread on the isles as well
[18:12:18] <selwyn> uh
[18:12:29] <selwyn> doesn't eastern europe have good soil in general

[18:13:09] <shka> modern day Russia, there is some but Russia is a large country 
[18:14:09] <shka> and back in the XII century you ought to rely on what you grow in your area

[18:18:05] <selwyn> i don't think they have buckwheat though
[18:18:58] <shka> that's odd, buckwheat is a tough motherfucker of a plant
[18:20:23] <shka> and I bet it could grow in Scotland no problemo
[18:20:49] <selwyn> it's more common to use poor land to graze sheep i would say
[18:21:22] <selwyn> because iiuc poor land in the uk is often hilly
[18:22:10] <shka> seems that buckwheat is not even that slavic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_buckwheat_dishes
[18:22:26] <shka> Koreans, Japs and even French\
[18:24:09] <selwyn> recently i have been addicted to korean street cooking youtube

[18:47:01] <gilberth> For my naïve benchmark, which is a toy Lisp interpreter, with lexical environments consed and all numbers boxed and consed running FIB, having a bump allocator alone gives me a 6% performance increase on my slow machine, and 18% on my fast machine. While the GC only takes like 0.5% or less.
[18:50:23] <gilberth> As the GC already takes only 0.5%, I don't believe I could buy much by stack allocation. But I can't really measure that, because I need a shadw stack pointing to frames, so that I could have a precise GC to begin with.
[18:57:16] <selwyn> 2% of the country has covid
[18:57:40] <gilberth> selwyn: That's bad. Very bad.
[18:57:58] <selwyn> correction: during the week ending on the 16th. probably higher now lol
[18:58:38] <gilberth> Oh dear! Doubling every two days is a ten-fold increase a week.
[18:59:10] <selwyn> my local area is at 2.5%
[18:59:19] <selwyn> i feel bad for the healthcare workers
[18:59:47] <gilberth> I feel bad for everyone needing a hospital right now.
[19:00:19] <selwyn> hopefully i wont
[19:00:23] <gilberth> Actually I consider to suggest that my cousin and I stock up and barricade ourselfs.
[19:02:29] <gilberth> But then somehow I feel like I would needlessly panic.
[19:04:15] <gilberth> On the other hand, would I catch Covid, I would probably need to be hospitalized. I consider myself a high-risk patient.
[19:05:15] <gilberth> And there is a real chance IMHO that the health system will face a collapse.
[19:30:32] <shka> selwyn: but not so many hospitalizations all things considered?
[19:30:44] <selwyn> apparently not at least not yet
[19:31:32] <shka> so far it seems that covid is less deadly then delta 
[19:32:08] <shka> but having all those mutations in the genome pool means that we should be careful 
[19:33:05] <gilberth> Well, won't help much with being way more infectious.
[19:33:47] <selwyn> plague island
[19:34:01] <selwyn> more than 50% of people i know have had it recently
[19:34:19] <gilberth> That many?
[19:34:27] <shka> what worries me is that omicron variant can recombine with something more dangerous
[19:34:28] <selwyn> well, informal survey
[19:34:34] <shka> like with flue
[19:36:10] <shka> there is plenty of coronavirus in the wild that don't infect humans so mixing omicron with one of those is possible 
[19:38:47] <gilberth> What worries me is the infection rate.
[19:44:40] <gilberth> And the reluctance of the government to act.
[20:03:49] <ck_> what kind of action would you prefer
[20:05:29] <gilberth> Some kind of lockdown and not "lalala christmas is so important!" and especially some sooner action.
[20:08:17] <ck_> yeah we'll see what the numbers say in a few weeks
[20:08:40] <MichaelRaskin> Does what is introduced since 28th count as some sort of lockdown?
[20:09:32] <MichaelRaskin> (It still contains some… wishful thinking)
[20:09:33] <ck_> when I think of "lockdown", it means a little more than "no dancing indoors" and so on
[20:11:00] <MichaelRaskin> What counted as hard lockdown in Germany was still not that strict but still worked but nobody wants to go that far…
[20:11:52] <MichaelRaskin> OK, there was a version with curfew and it was probably a bit silly (and all reasonable justifications for it were things that were forbidden anyway and easy to disperse)
[20:11:55] <gilberth> Yep, I wouldn't mind a real lockdown.
[20:12:24] <MichaelRaskin> A real real lockdown requires actually thinking about logistics
[20:12:55] <gilberth> We had two years to think about that.
[20:13:11] <MichaelRaskin> «I know what you didn't do last summer.»
[20:13:45] <MichaelRaskin> (neither did you do it the previous summer, but you should have…)
[20:15:00] <MichaelRaskin> Do you really expect people who couldn't straighten out low-stakes paperwork to be less in person to manage supply logistics for a real lockdown in a non-disastrous way?
[20:18:18] <MichaelRaskin> As a simpler but still useful logistics task, I did hope that once they started using the army to plug civilian holes, they would introduce a limited army-run supply delivery for people with already documented risk factors.
[20:18:41] <MichaelRaskin> At least in areas with fully congested supermarket-run delivery, which is approximately all of the areas
[20:18:59] <selwyn> in britain, using the army is a popular remedy for government failures/logistics issues
[20:19:25] <selwyn> admittedly an optimistic intepretation is that it worked well so far
[20:23:50] <MichaelRaskin> It makes some sense to demand that if you give an army a task it should be able to solve in a desert and under fire, and civilian logistics is broken but is not _worse_ than a desert, and you remove enemy fire, the army should be able to solve it.
[20:24:20] <selwyn> the british army has not solved many problems in a desert under fire recently :)
[20:24:26] <selwyn> but yes
[20:24:30] <MichaelRaskin> I guess if you make such demands often enough, the army gets used and actually solves it
[20:25:07] <MichaelRaskin> Look, there are micro tasks and macro tasks.
[20:25:37] <MichaelRaskin> I think it did pretty well bringing food where it was planned to be, while unable to rely on much local help.
[20:28:43] <MichaelRaskin> Not saying that's all they were asked to do with the desert, but that's the part they are asked to replicate inside UK
[20:29:20] <selwyn> yeah
[20:29:50] <selwyn> its unsettling when they get asked to deliver petrol though
[20:29:57] <selwyn> most countries can solve that logistical issue just fine
[20:30:50] <selwyn> i learnt recently that britain got rid of most of its gas reserves a few years ago
[20:33:45] <MichaelRaskin> As far as I understand the current situation in Germany, the following holds for a nonempty set of universities: 1. Work that can be done remotely, should be. 2. A ton of paperwork has to be done in person because Digital Transformation didn't include signing less pieces of paper.
[20:34:06] <MichaelRaskin> 3. In-person teaching is allowed and not even outright discouraged.
[20:36:20] <gilberth> MichaelRaskin: To answer your question from a while ago: No, I don't think the government could do that, even if it wished to do so.
[20:36:46] <MichaelRaskin> That's my impression too…
[20:37:23] <gilberth> And using the army for anything is a bit problematic here. Although this has changed in the last two decades and is more accepted by the public.
[20:37:59] <MichaelRaskin> I think the (new) federal minister of education started to act disappointed that school closures are clearly coming and surprise-surprise the schools are again not ready
[20:38:29] <MichaelRaskin> gilberth: well, they did use army to prop up the hospitals, I think
[20:38:32] <gilberth> Don't get me started on the school topic.
[20:39:18] <MichaelRaskin> I am kind of impressed they managed to plateau fourth wave without mass closing the schools.
[20:39:19] <gilberth> MichaelRaskin: Yes, very recently. The army also helped with those vaccination centers.
[20:41:08] <MichaelRaskin> Yeah, that's also the timeframe where I thought once they declared emergency and were using the army in its context, they might consider what tasks are being clearly failed and could be done by unarmed army members
[20:41:46] *** Joins: notzmv (~zmv@user/notzmv)
[20:42:08] <MichaelRaskin> I think a few weeks ago the military aviation was also used to transport least-concern-among-ICU-patients to less strained regions.
[20:45:50] <ck_> which could also be interpreted as a big fail honestly, the fact that that was even needed
[20:46:09] <gilberth> MichaelRaskin: Yes, that's true.
[20:47:39] <MichaelRaskin> ck_: well, if they thought that acting under stronger emergency will be politically or compliance-budget cheaper…
[20:48:41] <gilberth> Also consider that moving any patient under intensive care already is a risk for that patient. That's not funny.
[20:50:16] <MichaelRaskin> There are different levels of intensive care, of course, but even below them, if a person needs hospitalisation it is already suboptimal to have to move them long-range
[20:53:31] <gilberth> This very much depends. I winded up at the ICU last year and moving me would have in itself been safe unless I would collpase. And there was a chance of collapse, otherwise I won't have been there. Most of time, when I was under regular care, you could have moved me with no risk at all.
[20:55:01] <MichaelRaskin> Well, I hope they were using the best available evacuate-the-wounded aircraft with significant medical capabilities on board.
[20:55:22] <gilberth> I always assumed so.
[20:56:19] <MichaelRaskin> Which should lower the risk enough that they were willing to apply this risk to willingly unvaccinated young ending up in ICU due to CoViD-19…
[20:57:23] <gilberth> Doctors make no distinction between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. And who says that it was COVID patients, who got moved?
[20:57:41] <MichaelRaskin> That's unclear who exactly were moved, yeah
[20:58:34] <MichaelRaskin> This was a mild triage situation where a variety of factors could come into play, though
[20:59:46] <gilberth> That triage happens way earlier with postponing treatment. For instance cancer treatment/surgery. There must be collateral damages, that no one sees.
[21:00:51] <MichaelRaskin> It looks like some amount of triage went on all levels, yeah
[21:01:37] <MichaelRaskin> Sometimes also in the form of surgery risk-benefit analysis _given_ the infection situation.
[21:01:39] <gilberth> Yes, and this is why I am angry about all those people who don't want to get vaccinated.
[21:08:24] <MichaelRaskin> … among other people who should have known better but refused to …
[21:10:13] <gilberth> Didn't you know that using the brain hurts? This will never change.
[21:20:42] <shka> you care to much
[21:21:27] <gilberth> Indeed.
[21:21:56] <APic> Indeed.
[21:22:51] <MichaelRaskin> I think unlike me gilberth has reasons to perceive nontrivial immediate personal well-being risk from people's refusal to apply brains in the current situation, though
[21:24:51] <MichaelRaskin> Speaking of brain and hurt, it hurt to see stricter measures applied to museums than to in-door dining (I kid you not), and I cannot even rhetorically exclaim «what kind of logic brings that» because I sort of know the answer
[21:34:27] <gilberth> Yep, there is much less crowding in a museum and at a museum I could wear a mask all the time. That sure is more dangerous.
[21:36:30] <shka> such is the ideology of personal rights that people subscribe now
[21:36:36] * shka shrugs
[21:38:10] <selwyn> many of the conservatives here who are most into ww2 nostalgia are also the most against strict measures
[21:38:40] <shka> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JglSgUMBiec
[21:38:41] -ixelp- Killing Joke – "Savage Freedom" - YouTube
[21:38:42] <selwyn> guys who won't wear a mask fetishise a time of mass national mobilisation and sacrifice for the public good
[21:43:27] <gilberth> lol. I have not seen it this way.
[21:44:06] <selwyn> well
[21:44:14] <shka> historical experience may vary  
[21:44:19] <selwyn> what shka said
[21:44:34] <shka> in Poland it is all about "the damn nazis forcing us..."
[21:45:10] <selwyn> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkYp3bjWAAAAt0C?format=jpg&name=small
[21:45:20] <selwyn> a typical meme
[21:46:02] <gilberth> shka: This is funny because here it is a right wing protest and neo-nazis.
[21:46:08] <shka> gilberth: https://img.haarets.co.il/img/1.10471991/3204362304.png?precrop=633,633,x211,y34&width=1200&height=1200
[21:46:19] <shka> so... that happens
[21:46:30] <shka> the sign say "vaccination makes you free"
[21:46:34] <gilberth> selwyn: Fighters help against Covid?
[21:47:06] <shka> well, back when that country had some bollocks it also caused famine in the India...
[21:47:29] <gilberth> shka: Oh dear! That's not funny anymore.
[21:47:37] <selwyn> gilberth: it is a general statement of protest against modern life, lack of patriotism etc.
[21:47:49] <shka> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943
[21:47:54] <selwyn> issue is that people from 1940 itself don't necessarily want to return
[21:48:00] <shka> gilberth: no, it is, however, astonishing stupid
[21:48:22] <shka> the only common trait of all those movement is arrogance 
[21:48:35] <shka> like, the WORST type of arrogance 
[21:48:40] <selwyn> yeah
[21:48:46] <selwyn> i used to empathise with them to an extent
[21:49:08] <selwyn> but many of them are motivated by selfishness
[21:49:16] *** Quits: treflip (~user@user/treflip) (Quit: good night!)
[21:49:26] <shka> yeah, and it is always so grandiose 
[21:49:28] <selwyn> not lack of understanding, or legitimate concerns
[21:49:32] <shka> and hyperbolic
[21:49:50] <shka> listen, i don't want to wear fucking face mask either 
[21:50:05] <shka> but that is the reality of the situation 
[21:50:09] <selwyn> in the uk they appropriate the anti nazi struggle in the most crass way
[21:51:17] <shka> my theory is that those guys know that they are just selfish and have to prop themselves  using past symbolic
[21:51:48] <gilberth> Yes, we have a pandemic. And we are not in kindergarten anymore. I also don't like red traffic lights, yet I respect those. For my safety and for the safety of others. It's like "me! me! me! And I WANT this. Now. On a stick."
[21:51:54] <selwyn> my theory is that they are not that well informed on history anyway
[21:51:54] <shka> but it is, still, arrogance at it's worst
[21:51:59] <shka> or wurst in germany 
[21:52:11] <selwyn> so they have to use the only references (ww2) that everyone knows
[21:53:45] <gilberth> What I find a bit funny is that the local protest is by and pretty near to neo-nazis and yet the Polish believe in the very same people wanting them vaccinated? I was not aware.
[21:54:14] <selwyn> anyway, the truth about nazis and vaccines, is that while they indulged anti-vaxx beliefs to an extent as they were popular among the esoteric german right wing, they denied them to eastern europe because they knew that vaccines saved lives
[21:54:22] <gilberth> shka: Is that a common theme make Germany responsible for all "evil"? Or nazis?
[21:54:23] <shka> gilberth: nothing to understand here, you can't logic with the illogic
[21:55:30] <shka> gilberth: nah, right now it is about the imaginary "leftism" jews... well the nazi stuff really
[21:55:46] <shka> and homophobia is the actual state ideology 
[21:55:50] <epony> it's likely that the protesters are workers in the commerce sector living off the back of society and their affiliated controlling political elements - hotels & drinking & drug selling sectors
[21:55:55] <gilberth> This sounds like all mixed up.
[21:55:59] <shka> yes
[21:56:07] <shka> and it is abhorrent to me
[21:56:24] <epony> and any "false" cause is used, just to oppose the "taxation" and "health" measures
[21:56:25] <selwyn> it seems much too devoid of substance to form a ruling ideology tbh
[21:56:53] <epony> these sectors are however parasites and cause health and society destruction problems
[21:57:02] <gilberth> Yep, would be more coherent when you could make up their mind.
[21:57:21] <gilberth> * when they could
[21:57:44] <shka> selwyn: neither was the facism 
[21:57:59] <shka> nazi were also incoherent to say the least
[21:58:48] <shka> in fact, incoherence is the point
[21:59:25] <selwyn> good point
[21:59:27] <shka> goal of those ideologies is compliance by subverting intelect 
[21:59:33] <epony> narcotis and prostitution is not national interests, it's the opposite, it's destructive and absolutely abominiable
[22:00:50] <epony> the protests are used to replace political control merely, the population achieves better results when working together, instead of being split and opposed against each other
[22:00:55] <selwyn> anyway, as you posted, the bengal famine says a lot about the empire
[22:01:38] <epony> empires are horrors of the feodalism epoch and should be condemned historically as injustice and genocidal
[22:02:38] <shka> furthermore, it is not like Britain was in danger of the invasion 
[22:02:57] <shka> for that to happen, royal navy would have to cease to exist
[22:03:10] <shka> and that is a tall order in the 40s
[22:04:10] <epony> the crisis management funding is the target of the political changes, protests are used in many countries to replace the pre- and during- crisis governments
[22:04:33] <epony> after the crisis, the current protest installed governments will be wiped again
[22:04:46] <epony> that's the commercialisation of pandemics as a service
[22:04:58] <shka> from safest places, the bravest words
[22:05:08] <epony> ;-)
[22:05:20] <selwyn> more importantly
[22:05:34] <selwyn> if 3 million people were going to starve to death in britain they would have done something about it
[22:05:43] <selwyn> but bengal doesn't matter as much
[22:06:49] <shka> what about dying from a deadly virus though? :D
[22:06:50] <epony> does not make any word incorrect regardless whether you live below the poverty line or outside the sectors of benefits of any of this
[22:08:24] <epony> narcotics, sexually and airborne transmitted diseases and their controlling groups are deadly
[22:09:15] <selwyn> shka: yeah it doesn't matter if 100k people die in britain now
[22:09:19] <selwyn> this is progress :)
[22:11:18] <epony> the problems are obviously affecting all countries, regardless of who protests (and the protests are political and financial interests of the crisis lured power and control replacements)
[22:17:40] <shka> well, if?
[22:18:07] <shka> right now, in Poland, official number of covid deaths is 93 445
[22:20:01] <shka> and as for the "excess deaths" 178 thousands
[22:20:14] <shka> so it is pretty grim here 
[22:20:28] <selwyn> i mean to say, it is simply not that big of a deal for the people in charge here if that number of people die
[22:20:34] <selwyn> it is not a matter of incorrect policies
[22:22:42] <selwyn> boris johnson: “no more fucking lockdowns – let the bodies pile high in their thousands”
[22:22:49] <shka> oh, and our government introduces tax "reform" and changes to the education
[22:23:18] <shka> new subject introduced, which is literally propaganda 
[22:30:10] <epony> yes, there are controversial political processes happening on the aftermath of several waves of medical disasters, that result in energetics sectors pushes that were "global warming" and now are "energetics commercialisation"
[22:32:30] <epony> politicians are not ethical people, neither are sellers of death and taxation
[22:49:46] <hayley> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ietkuUZwjpU
[22:49:47] -ixelp- Cymbaline - YouTube
[22:49:50] <epony> and the new politicians are private sector and renewables so they will affect badly energy prices and sanction former businesses of previous politicians (electorat)
[22:50:56] <epony> the common theme is "narcotics" and "social services collapse" that started in the post-80ies global changes
[22:51:56] <epony> to it is added forced pharmacy consumption and commercialisation of energetics and disease outbreaks
[22:53:13] <epony> just not being part of the wrongdoings is better than being "annoyed" by media, politics and street trouble-millitants

[23:04:38] * shka works in chaotic company so nobody even thought about standardizing tech stack
[23:06:18] * hayley doesn't work so nobody thought about standardizing tech stack
[23:07:58] * gilberth doesn't work either and but it's standardized here to use CL.
[23:08:54] <epony> the colours of your nicknames match the new coalition ;-)
[23:10:25] <gilberth> hayley: I lost. My GC is so fast that NaN boxing doesn't buy anything. I'll try with a different typing scheme; I will not surrender.
[23:11:19] <epony> garbage separation and processing should be HW automated
[23:11:52] <epony> so categorisation / sorting during use (intent decommission) is a solution
[23:13:02] <hayley> gilberth: What happens if you drop your heap size?
[23:16:09] <epony> here is one problem that is unrelated yet exactly for the same reason: desyncing of A/V muxers
[23:16:12] <gilberth> hayley: How far should I drop that? I currently have a 16k conses heap. GC is 0.3% with NaN-boxing. And 0.5% w/o.
[23:16:31] <gilberth> Perhaps I should do a plot or sth.
[23:16:34] <hayley> Sheesh, what program are you testing with?
[23:17:06] <epony> that is because video demux syncs on audio and that causes problems, they should both sync on timecode / sync line, not to any of the other
[23:17:21] <epony> so for data and instructions, you need syncing too ;-)
[23:17:39] <epony> they are now 'bundled'
[23:18:08] <gilberth> hayley: A toy Lisp interpreter. Our favorite benchmark. The interpreter is a pure interpreter, no BC. Environments are always conses, as are argument lists, all numbers are boxed (no fixnums).
[23:18:27] <hayley> Sure, what are you interpreting?
[23:18:36] <gilberth> Lisp?
[23:18:56] <hayley> What program are you running in the Lisp interpreter?
[23:19:10] <gilberth> Our favorite benchmark: FIB.
[23:19:13] <hayley> I test with a symbolic derivative program.
[23:19:17] <pl> selwyn: I'm going to work on lower layers of platform for Snowflake, which does kind of Data Warehouse as Service 
[23:20:13] <gilberth> hayley: Then in your program there shouldn't be not many numbers consed. Which one, the one from the Gabriel book?
[23:20:31] <pl> Among other things, that involves building the customised OS for their services 
[23:20:31] <hayley> Probably not.
[23:20:44] <selwyn> wow
[23:20:48] * gilberth starts to garble sentences. ECOFFEEUNDERFLOW
[23:20:56] <hayley> The Racket GC hacking language is bad in a few ways, and one is that it is hard to make fixnums.
[23:21:11] <selwyn> is the german coffee fixation a genuinely national thing
[23:21:17] <selwyn> or do they not like it in bavaria or sth
[23:21:36] <epony> coffee is liked in EU ;-)
[23:21:42] <gilberth> selwyn: Do I look like I am an Bavarian?
[23:21:50] <gilberth> hayley: Why is that?
[23:21:53] <selwyn> well you know more about them than i do
[23:22:31] <hayley> gilberth: One of the contracts specifies that you have to return a valid address for each operation.
[23:22:41] <gilberth> Indeed. But I can't help you with the coffee question. What I know is that further up north towards the sea, it's more tea.
[23:22:53] <hayley> The virtual machine is more or less word-addressed, too, so nowhere to put tags.
[23:23:01] <epony> and islands are teapots ;-)
[23:23:15] <gilberth> hayley: Won't pre-consed numbers help? Just a few as I did with my ulisp?
[23:24:18] <pl> selwyn: running customised OS is not that unusual 
[23:24:31] <pl> Now, a fully custom OS like ticketmaster runs... 
[23:24:50] <hayley> gilberth: Hard to say.
[23:24:53] <epony> in fact it's a transformational process and happening in the US too, separation of data processing, now business services immitate UNIX
[23:25:31] <epony> so, microservices, companies that are service processors in the cloud through some proprietary own stack etc
[23:25:35] <ck_> I thought for a second "a fully custom OS like" .. continued with "TempleOS"
[23:25:49] <gilberth> hayley: Well, with the slow Boehm collector, it helped with the FIB benchmark. And I just have -1000..1000 pre-consed.
[23:27:03] *** Joins: pjb (~pjb@user/pjb)
[23:27:09] <gilberth> hayley: For what it is worth, I use Fenichel-Yochelson.
[23:27:38] <gilberth> Perhaps it's time that I port a few benchmarks to my Core Lisp. Shouldn't be too hard.
[23:28:19] <epony> so it's likely a company working for the US sector exporting their produce or working on commission from such.. and then they all will have to time sync on "oh my-cron" as a service (dark theme, unhumour)
[23:29:26] <pl> ck_: afaik TempleOS guy worked on the tìcketmaster custom OS? 
[23:29:33] <epony> yep
[23:29:36] <selwyn> yeah i think he did
[23:29:41] <hayley> I vaguely remember this.
[23:29:47] <pl> Wasn't the principal author though, but it was through Temple OS that I learnt about ticketmaster 
[23:30:21] <epony> ticketing is a service in the event space.. sometimes not for stadium gatherings but for train-spotting
[23:31:24] <gilberth> hayley: My GC must ge slower. I need to reduce the heal size to 512 objects until I see a clear advantage of NaN boxing and thus no number consing. Or a better interpreter, but I like it that cons-happy for now.
[23:31:33] <gilberth> * heap
[23:32:08] <epony> bookings / ticketing is perl-ish
