[00:08:47] <mete> daemon: the service account has read access on the config file, yes?
[00:09:56] <mete> daemon: If the OpenVPN service wrapper (openvpnserv.exe) encounters fatal errors, it will write them to the windows event log, which can be viewed in Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Event Viewer -> Application Log.
[00:09:56] <daemon> its a windows service so it should be running with administrative priv and to be honest this is a brand new install and the third windows machine setup with openvpn - non of the others required any special permissions I do not see why this one would
[00:10:05] <daemon> ah perfect let me check that
[00:10:36] <mete> I've that from here: https://openvpn.net/community-resources/running-openvpn-as-a-windows-service/
[00:10:36] <mete> :)
[00:10:44] <mete> I'm not running ovpn as service on windows
[00:10:47] <mete> just googling..
[00:11:36] <daemon> nothing in the logs just service stopped succesfully ... started succesfully etc :|
[00:13:00] <daemon> yeah no love 
[00:13:04] <daemon> I copied the config from my other windows system changed the key/priv part
[00:13:07] <daemon> (which do work as I can do it from command line)
[00:13:09] <daemon> and zero, just says service started
[00:13:12] <daemon> no logs no anything
[00:13:34] <mete> hmm
[00:13:59] <mete> are the key/priv part files or embedded to the config?
[00:14:12] <daemon> embedded
[00:14:18] <mete> ok, good
[00:14:20] <daemon> I mass generate them on the key server for my mixture of devices
[00:15:11] *** Quits: cation (cation@user/cation) (Quit: Leaving)
[00:15:35] <mete> as I understand the windows service will simply create multiple openvpn.exe processes
[00:15:41] <mete> are there any processes in the task manager?
[00:16:26] <daemon> sorry just reconnected
[00:16:27] <daemon> I tried setting a more absolute log path
[00:16:29] <daemon> log-append            "c:\\users\\paulg\\paulwebster_udp.conf.log"
[00:16:32] <daemon> and then the service failed to start at all
[00:16:33] <daemon> so it is reading the config at least
[00:17:05] <daemon> brb lets try it one more time :)
[00:18:41] <daemon> got it!
[00:18:46] <daemon> I removed that directory as I could not see why it was there
[00:18:56] <daemon> and that then caused that error, weirdly that directory exists on non of my other systems what so ever
[00:19:19] <mete> what directory? :D
[00:19:34] <daemon> ah I might not have been connected when I sent that
[00:19:38] <daemon> daemon> got it!
[00:19:40] <daemon> <daemon> Service cannot be started. System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path 'C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config-auto'.
[00:19:45] <daemon> my ZNC is on the other end of the vpn :)
[00:19:59] <daemon> I was putting the configs in \config\
[00:20:00] <mete> ahaha :D
[00:20:07] <daemon> which is where they are on every other system
[00:20:10] <mete> maybe because of new openvpn version or so..
[00:20:12] <mete> no idea :)
[00:20:19] <daemon> me neither least its resolved now though!
[00:20:21] <daemon> cheer :)
[00:20:25] <daemon> cheers* :)
[00:20:59] <mete> :) good my vpns to znc are running on my firewall, not on my windows pcs ;)

[01:02:36] <mete> shibboleth: it is a site2site vpn, how should I do that on a client?
[01:02:57] <mete> and, data between my irc client (which is not running as root) and the bounces is also encrypted...
[01:03:01] <mete> so I don't see an issue
[01:03:05] <shibboleth> are you running an irc bouncer on a router?
[01:03:21] <mete> no, the bounce is running on a server on another site
[01:03:32] <shibboleth> well, then nvm
