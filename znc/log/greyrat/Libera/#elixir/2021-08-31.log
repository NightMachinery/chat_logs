[00:14:30] <benwilson512> er not exactly
[00:16:04] <benwilson512> there are common code identifiers that the language plugin annotates your code with and then the theme references that

[16:39:03] <tatsumaru> Hey guys, I am looking to build an chat analytics app with natural language processing which can utilize machine learning to identify personality patterns based on behavior and language. I was wondering if elixir was a good language to use for that purpose or if I should stick to python?

[16:40:18] <rawtaz> ouch, that sounds horrible
[16:40:28] <tatsumaru> horrible how
[16:40:45] <rawtaz> it sounds like a privacy invasive app that analyzes people :7
[16:40:58] <rawtaz> sounds cool technically but not in what it does :)
[16:41:56] <tatsumaru> well, if I analyze them myself when I talk to them is that also privacy invasive?
[16:42:41] <rawtaz> i think so. if i were to talk with you, i wouldnt want you to analyze me (more than what anyone would naturally in terms of body language etc)
[16:42:58] <OMGOMG> rawtaz: that video was great
[16:43:13] <rawtaz> OMGOMG: yeah! :D what a productive beast
[16:43:27] <tatsumaru> so basically you only want to talk to people who aren't capable to understand you above a certain threshold

[16:44:08] <tatsumaru> sorry for bad grammar, lack of sleep
[16:44:26] <rawtaz> tatsumaru: understand above a certain treshold makes it sound as if it's not fully understanding, i dont think thats what i mean. i think you understand what i mean :)
[16:44:56] <rawtaz> its really simple. stop analyzing people more than a common chat eye to eye would involve, unless they asked you to
[16:45:16] <rawtaz> that said perhaps you have a scenario that is more explicit and where it's fine
[16:45:29] <tatsumaru> I understand what you mean, but I also think that setting the analysis bar arbitrarily is hypocritical.
[16:45:42] <rawtaz> what do you mean setting it arbitrarily?
[16:45:58] <tatsumaru> well you said that analyzing body language is fine for example. why would that be fine?
[16:46:43] <rawtaz> because thats what *everyone* does by nature since humanity was born, basically
[16:47:07] <rawtaz> what you are talking about on the other hand is beyond that, an automated and technical additional analyzing to be done
[16:47:17] <rawtaz> clearly these are two different levels of analyzing someone :)
[16:48:15] <tatsumaru> ignore the AI for a moment, it's clear that a forensic psychologist will be able to derive more insights by talking to you even without using any software tools. so in a sense if someone is capable of more they shouldn't be talking to you or should make sure that you are fine with their abilities?
[16:49:15] <rawtaz> you are overspecifying things.. seriously, dont you get my *point* (without demanding a formal specification of it)?
[16:49:22] <rawtaz> lets take an example.
[16:49:49] <rawtaz> you are at a party or whatever, a social gathering. there's a psychologist there, who let's assume could derive a ton of private/personal information from your behavior.
[16:50:16] <rawtaz> is it fine that he/she does that when talking to you, because she can? no, it's not, because that is crossing your personal boundaries/privacy.
[16:50:35] <rawtaz> it's a matter of this psychologist not doing that because it is not okay. just because she can doesnt make it ok
[16:50:44] <tatsumaru> that's not how security works, if the information is publicly available, then it's not private.
[16:51:02] <rawtaz> we're not talking about security, we're talking about common sense, moral and personal interaction.
[16:51:45] <tatsumaru> I am not sure if a psychologist can actually consciously choose to not understand you to his/her fullest capacity.
[16:51:48] <rawtaz> i wasnt suggesting that someone who can derive things from others stop talking with them in order to not derive things. im just talking about what's proper
[16:52:39] <norrland> tatsumaru: I'm not familiar with ML/AI. https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2021/01/13/orchestrating-computer-vision-with-elixir-at-v7/
[16:52:47] <rawtaz> that level of detail isnt needed, obviously there will be certain things that will be interpreted unconciosly, but that doesnt mean they have to do a full analysis :)
[16:52:53] <norrland> but there you have some blog-post about the NX project.
[16:54:05] <tatsumaru> at the end of the day ethics isn't about choosing to ignore something that's in front of you, but making proper decisions about what to do with that information.
[16:54:06] <norrland> https://changelog.com/podcast/439
[16:54:21] <tatsumaru> norrland I will take a look at those links
[16:54:26] <tatsumaru> thanks
[16:56:41] <rawtaz> tatsumaru: sure, but it's also about not analyzing someone in a way that extracts information that shouldnt be extracted unless you explicitly tried to extract it, without their consent. in other words, beyond what would happen naturally in e.g. a conversation (there's a difference between that and e.g. applying automated and technical means to extract additional information or understanding).
[16:56:59] <norrland> The closest example I can think of are those old irc-stat sites/scripts where you get stats/metrics from irc-logs put into certain categories based on set rules.

[17:18:42] <tatsumaru> rawtaz I frankly don't see the difference. the intention is the same, in one case the intention is being expressed more effectively than the other (potentially).
[17:19:03] <tatsumaru> Nicd, ok sorry I won't say more about this

[17:28:11] <rawtaz> tatsumaru: well im not sure what to say then, if you are unable to identify the obvious difference between those two simple cases.
[17:28:19] <rawtaz> quite odd.
[17:38:02] <tatsumaru> ad hominem
[17:40:02] <Nicd> rawtaz: chill. And IRC automatically cuts messages that are too long
[17:47:52] <rawtaz> Nicd: i am chill, what's your problem? we've had a 100% civilized discussion..
[17:48:07] <rawtaz> yeah i know it does. i never have a good feel for when too long is though :P
[18:03:01] <whk> HR once told me I am negative in slack chat and I have to change my behaviour. I used analytics and natural language processing to show that the computer says nah... did not really convince them, but was fun. 
[18:03:52] <whk> I would attempt it with elixir, but not sure if the tooling compares with python yet... maybe in the near future. 
[18:04:16] <tatsumaru> did you use analytics to convince them they were insane
[18:04:55] <whk> lol, i wish i could.

[18:07:04] <tatsumaru> all hail the new industry
[18:08:06] <whk> i think it can there is a space for unbaising tools interpreting communication, but like anything can be pretty horrid used the wrong way. 
[18:08:24] <tatsumaru> whk that's a pandora's box for sure
[18:11:59] <dcz> tech like this is usually used without the participant being aware is the problem
[18:13:32] <whk> and being aware does not mean clicking agree on terms not really intended to be read. 
[18:15:45] <dcz> relating to what rawtaz said, human memory is inaccurate, ephemeral and fallible, whereas computer memory is way more binary... and there's no reason to believe analytics data is going to get discarded
[18:18:24] <tatsumaru> honestly though, there's no such thing as "unbiased" there's just conforming to some consensual bias
[18:19:03] <tatsumaru> personally I think it's scary to dogmatize any specific set of beliefs about what's optimal
[18:19:15] <tatsumaru> at best it leads to stagnation
