[07:13:56] <thebes> so I'd like to use the argument principle - if f(z) is meromorphic and the contour does not pass through any of its zeros or singularities the integral is equal to: sum_{zeros of f} winding number of zeros
[07:14:06] <thebes> i forgot a 1/2pi i before the integral
[07:14:16] <thebes> Fangs yes I believe so hopefully

[07:16:29] <X-Scale> em: precisely. I'm taking a look at chap. 5 about projective geometry and homogeneous coordinates
[07:16:32] <thebes> so I figure the answer is 4, since the contour contains 4 of the zeros which each have winding number 1, with all the outer ones only having winding number 0

[10:47:59] <bildramer> maybe if there's another restriction: it's a tree with degree <= 3, you add edges that keep that true, and once you add an edge you mark the vertices and can't add other edges to either vertex

[14:48:14] <Fangs> usually you can give a group as a presentation, for example: D_4 = < s, r | r^4 = 1, s^2 = 1, sr = rs>
[14:48:27] <Fangs> usually you can give a group as a presentation, for example: D_4 = < s, r | r^4 = 1, s^2 = 1, sr = r^(-1) s>
[14:48:51] <b3z> Need to check that out.
[14:49:00] <Fangs> the {s, r} tells you the set of generators, so every element of D_4 is expressed as a product of s and r
[14:49:27] <Fangs> 1 is the identity element ofc (think of the identity row/col that doesn't permute the symbol)

[14:52:14] <Fangs> (infact thats usually how you would define D_4)

[15:06:56] <int-e> you can't represent 1.0000000000000000000000000034 (the closest IEEE double is 1)

[16:22:45] <qed-office> CuriousErnestBro in israel you also usually do masters before phd

[16:23:17] <Fangs> no if you're in the US, yes if you're in Europe, from what I understand
[16:23:18] <qed-office> here phd lasts 4.5-5 years
[16:23:25] <qed-office> and a masters 2 years
[16:23:35] <CuriousErnestBro> rubiksdream your education is not considered "complete" since the Netherlands switched over from their own system to the bachelors-masters system, so the "doctorandus" got split up in 2 degrees
[16:23:36] <qed-office> my phd lasted 4.8 years
[16:23:43] <PlanckWalk> Masters isn't very common before PhD at the university I attended (in Australia)
[16:23:56] <qed-office> phd length PlanckWalk?
[16:24:11] <CuriousErnestBro> rubiksdream I have no idea how long a PhD is here, my friend is doing a part time one where he just has to write like 4 papers
[16:24:14] <PlanckWalk> It's allowed to be as short as 3 years, but can be up to 7 years
[16:24:24] <PlanckWalk> (Depending upon circumstances)
[16:24:26] <qed-office> I understand
[16:24:34] <qed-office> so the max is like the max in israel
[16:24:41] <qed-office> 2+5
[16:24:41] <CuriousErnestBro> A couple of girls in my class are doing PhD's at prestigious uni's but I'm not really in contact with them
[16:24:44] <rubiksdream> i think thats the same as where im going

[16:24:53] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: they're getting more common I think
[16:25:06] <rubiksdream> only 4 years of a guaranteed stipend though
[16:25:15] <qed-office> here only the most accomplished students can go straight to phd
[16:25:15] <Fangs> PlanckWalk: idk whose smart bright idea it is to force everyone to do masters.. they axed honours program in my uni for maths
[16:25:19] <PlanckWalk> The scholarships are usually for 4 years

[16:27:20] <qed-office> CuriousErnestBro , this is a paper from the phd that I like https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/19M1268859

[16:28:44] <greenbagels> 3 year phd, damn
[16:28:54] <greenbagels> sounds like hell
[16:29:01] <rubiksdream> but that isn't the norm
[16:29:10] <greenbagels> i'd imagine
[16:29:12] <rubiksdream> its 3 years with an mphil
[16:29:19] <greenbagels> yeah i would have guessed that
[16:29:22] <PlanckWalk> I don't think anyone actually attained it in 3 years, at least not in math. But it would be allowed by university rules.
[16:29:23] <rubiksdream> in other words you've done a thesis with someone already
[16:29:25] <qed-office> 3 years is not enough for a phd
[16:29:35] <rubiksdream> and you are just continuing work in a similar area in 3 years
[16:29:52] <greenbagels> yeah in math, from what i *hear* (i have no experience) it sounds tough
[16:30:01] <greenbagels> since so much of it is prerequisite coursework from my understanding
[16:30:10] <qed-office> 3 years is barey enough for the 7 cups of coffee per day to start working
[16:30:13] <rubiksdream> but of course there will be exceptional cases where they go from a bachelors to a phd program and complete their thesis in a year or two
[16:30:21] <rubiksdream> those for sure exist
[16:30:24] <qed-office> that is  the secret of a good phd after all

[16:37:45] <PlanckWalk> dila: Depends upon your conventions/definitions
[16:37:51] <greenbagels> dila: ring with unity?
[16:38:03] <Z-module> dila, 2Z has no multiplicative identity element, so for most people that disqualifies it from being a subring of Z. But it *is* an ideal of Z.
[16:38:10] <PlanckWalk> They're not a subring-with-unity, but they are a subrng
[16:38:27] <dila> ok thanks a lot. that pretty much agrees with what i expected
[16:38:30] <PlanckWalk> Conventions differ on which of these is called a "subring"
[16:38:32] <Z-module> yeah, if you think about rings with no unity, sometimes called rngs, then it is a subrng
[16:38:33] <dila> i realise that they are an ideal though
[16:38:58] <Z-module> Z has no proper subrings at all unless you count {0}
[16:39:03] <Z-module> (for rings with unity, I mean)
[16:39:06] <dila> an example of an ideal that is not a subring (a ring with unity)
[16:39:32] <PlanckWalk> There aren't many ideals that are subrings-with-unity ;-)
[16:39:51] <greenbagels> definitely not an ideal scenario for sure
[16:40:23] <dila> i wonder why i ever considered it then, that ideals were subrings
[16:40:32] <PlanckWalk> Under some definitions, they are
[16:40:49] <PlanckWalk> But it seems not under the ones you are using at the moment
[16:40:50] <Z-module> here's a more troublesome example: in the ring Z/10Z, the subset E = {[0],[2],[4],[6],[8]} is an ideal, and it does have a multplicative identity element, namely [6]  (check it out). But this identity is not the one from Z/10Z.  So here too, many people would say it's not strictly speaking a subring.
[16:41:20] <greenbagels> dila: i think what worked for me was thinking about them like how you thought about cosets in group theory
[16:41:31] <greenbagels> unless you're learning ring theory before group theory, at which point i cant help
[16:41:37] <Z-module> ideals are exactly all the possible kernels of ring homomorphisms
[16:42:09] <greenbagels> yea
[16:42:16] <dila> it's true that i should revisit groups
[16:42:53] <rubiksdream> this isn't going to be helpful to dila, but when ideals really clicked for me is when I realized they are just R-submodules of the ring R, which I found more intuitive a notion because I find modules more intuitive than rings
[16:43:07] <greenbagels> really?
[16:43:17] <rubiksdream> yeah
[16:43:18] <greenbagels> complete opposite for me
[16:43:18] <dila> yeh modules don't appear in my book at all
[16:43:21] <greenbagels> modules feel way too abstract
[16:43:31] <dila> a module is a group without inverses?
[16:43:40] <rubiksdream> being 'basically a vector space' without division clicks more than me than a ring for some reason
[16:43:57] <rubiksdream> but its probably not universal
[16:44:06] <Z-module> they turn out to be immensely useful in algebra
[16:44:25] <rubiksdream> yeah and even in algebraic topology
[16:44:33] <buster> dila, that's a monoid
[16:44:34] <rubiksdream> when computing simplicial homology groups for example
[16:44:40] <rubiksdream> smith normal form is indispensable
[16:44:50] <rubiksdream> especially for larger calculations
[16:44:54] <dila> buster: ok thanks. that's also not covered by my book
[16:45:18] <greenbagels> dila: referencing multiple books at once might also be useful

[16:45:22] *** Quits: specing (~specing@user/specing) (Quit: ZNC - https://znc.in)
[16:45:47] <rubiksdream> i guess the way I saw it was when you define a ring, the natural thing to do with it is to use it like a field in the context of a vector space, rather than explore the ring itself
[16:46:06] <dila> what i was trying to do was to "collapse" E[y]/<q(y)> where E=F[x]/<p(x)> into a single quotient with a single ideal generator
[16:46:56] <dila> it seems there are two ideals here. so all elements are: <p(x)> + <q(y)> + x
[16:47:23] <Fangs> surely you meant foobar not x there
[16:47:31] <dila> yes
[16:47:59] <dila> the part not in any ideal. bad choice of variable
[16:48:27] <dila> i know it's possible because all finite fields are isomorphic to simple field extension
[16:49:26] <Fangs> 22:09 <dila> an example of an ideal that is not a subring (a ring with unity) <-- idk if they told you but any ideal with 1 (of the ring) has to be the entire ring
[16:49:40] <rubiksdream> were you working with specific p,q,F?
[16:49:55] <rubiksdream> ah okay F is a finite field
[16:49:58] <dila> F was Z/pZ but no specific p and q
[16:50:03] <Fangs> dila: let R be a ring, then R is an R-module over itself and ideals are R-submodules
[16:50:39] <Fangs> idk if you're familiar with algebras over rings, but if A c B is a subring, this makes B into an A-algebra
[16:50:42] <rubiksdream> dila so p and q are irreducibles?
[16:50:48] <dila> yes, irriducible

[16:54:53] <dila> ok, that's a shame
[16:54:56] <rubiksdream> well you could say M = F[y] / (p,q), but this would only be up to isomorphism
[16:55:08] <rubiksdream> of course you could use a single ideal generator
[16:55:16] <rubiksdream> but it would again only be up to isomorphism
[16:55:19] <Fangs> you can probably go to F[x,y] and quotient out by an ideal generated by p(x) and q(y)
[16:55:29] <Fangs> but I doubt you can do it with just one generator
[16:55:44] <rubiksdream> but do what with one generator?
[16:55:50] <rubiksdream> like what does 'collapse' mean here
[16:55:52] <rubiksdream> its not clear
[16:55:58] <rubiksdream> are we saying everything is up to isomorphism?
[16:56:03] <rubiksdream> or is there an embedding we want to preserve?
[16:56:04] <dila> no, actual equality
[16:56:10] <rubiksdream> you wont ever get actual equality
[16:56:18] <rubiksdream> simply because of how you constructed E
[16:56:33] <rubiksdream> its a set of cosets
[16:56:43] <rubiksdream> and then you quotient again
[16:56:45] <rubiksdream> a set of sets of cosets
[16:56:52] <Fangs> dila: take the homomorphism F[x,y] -> F that sends x and y to idk.. 0 and 0. then the ideal should be (x,y)
[16:56:53] <rubiksdream> if you quotient once which is what you want to od
[16:57:12] <rubiksdream> you will get a set of cosets
[16:57:17] <rubiksdream> so actual equality is impossible
[16:57:33] <Fangs> dila: rings where every ideal can be generated by one element has a special name and they are called principal ideal domain
[16:57:47] <dila> yes, i understand now
[16:58:47] <rubiksdream> but what you said about finite fields, which is why you think there would be a single ideal generator is true...
[16:58:52] <rubiksdream> its just that everything would be up to iso
[16:59:01] <rubiksdream> which is fine? if you dont care about a particular embedding
[16:59:05] <dila> i'd hoped that my first extension F(a) for algebraic a and then a second extension (F(a))(b) would equal F(c) for some c
[16:59:17] <dila> and have a corresponding minimal polynomial in F[x]
[16:59:29] <rubiksdream> ah I see
[16:59:46] <rubiksdream> well of course that is true
[16:59:50] <rubiksdream> your F is Z / pZ
[17:00:05] <rubiksdream> every finite field is of the form F(\alpha) for some element \alpha
[17:00:07] <dila> ok but you're saying it's an isomorphism only
[17:00:19] <rubiksdream> what do you mean 'only'?
[17:00:33] <dila> rather than actual equality
[17:00:40] <rubiksdream> i dont understand
[17:01:01] <Fangs> rubiksdream: you can't get a field extention with V_4 (or Z/2Z x Z/2Z) galois group?
[17:01:09] <dila> it's ok, thanks a lot for the help
[17:01:38] <dila> i see that F[x] and E[y] have different indeterminates
[17:02:05] <Fangs> dila: its possibly true for finite fields, but with Q, thats not always true. you can take Q -> Q[sqrt(2)] -> Q[sqrt(2),sqrt(3)]
[17:02:05] <rubiksdream> dila there is definitely some c in (F(a))(b) such that F(c) = (F(a))(b), take any c that generates the multiplicative group of (F(a))(b)
[17:02:10] <rubiksdream> this will be actual equality
[17:02:24] <rubiksdream> does that help?
[17:02:41] <rubiksdream> i am saying you can take c literally inside (F(a))(b)
[17:02:45] <rubiksdream> which seems to be closer to what you wanted
[17:02:59] <dila> yes i see. unless F=Q according to Fangs
[17:03:08] <rubiksdream> Fangs it is a different situation with finite fields
[17:03:15] <rubiksdream> Fangs because their multiplicative groups are finite
[17:03:35] <rubiksdream> finite fields are always generated by one element over their prime fields
[17:04:04] <rubiksdream> yeah, well F is not Q here
[17:04:08] <rubiksdream> so your c exists
[17:04:13] <rubiksdream> its not easy to find though
[17:04:16] <dila> but you used =
[17:04:19] <dila> not \cong
[17:04:25] <rubiksdream> yeah , I meant equal
[17:04:27] <Fangs> rubiksdream: I said its possibly true for finite fields
[17:04:28] <rubiksdream> as sets
[17:04:40] <rubiksdream> i know, im just explaining why it is
[17:04:52] <dila> this seems to go against what you said before about it not being possible to "collapse" the tower of quotients
[17:04:58] <rubiksdream> dila there is a c in (F(a))(b) for which (F(a))(b) = F(c) as sets
[17:05:50] <rubiksdream> because F(a) and F[x]/(P) are strictly speaking isomorphic, not equal

[17:07:29] <rubiksdream> once you fix (F(a))(b), there is indeed a c inside it for which F(c) is the same set as (F(a))(b)
[17:07:49] <rubiksdream> but that c will be a set of sets of cosets
[17:08:05] <dila> so if F(a) \cong F[x]/(P) and F(b) \cong F[x]/(Q), you're saying that although F(a)=F(b) it might only be that F[x]/(P) \cong F[x]/(Q) (rather than an equality)

[17:09:46] <rubiksdream> a and b can have different min polys
[17:09:51] <rubiksdream> just because they have the same degree over F
[17:09:54] <dila> its not as obscure as it sounds because the galois group elements map from a to b (as far as i understand)
[17:09:59] <rubiksdream> does not mean they have the same min poly..
[17:10:45] <rubiksdream> dila very plainly, P and Q can be different irreducible polys of the same degree
[17:10:50] <rubiksdream> even though F(a) = F(b)

[21:10:56] <Z-module> anway, savask, it's kind of neat (though very basic) that if you take any "base" D for Z as in that paper (the most elementary example being {(-2)^0, (-2)^1, (-2)^2, (-2)^3, ...} ), then you can partition D in any way into two infinite subsets A', B' and now set A = {all finite sums of things from A'}, B = {all finite sums of things from B'}  and this A, B now works for your direct sum problem.
[21:11:34] <savask> Indeed
