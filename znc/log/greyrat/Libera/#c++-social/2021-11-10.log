[14:51:52] <Carbonflux> Unity bought WETA for 1.5 billion

[14:53:22] <Carbonflux> seems like unity has a lot of money to throw around as well.

[16:42:04] <dukwon> it only stopped when the list became restricted, but it still took half an hour for all of the messages to come in
[16:43:11] <dukwon> ah i missed 3 bounceback messages that went to my spam folder
[16:48:19] <T`aZ> fucking ms teams is so retarded
[16:48:34] <T`aZ> you type "hi" it automatically changes it to an animated smiley handwaving

[16:49:14] <dukwon> ew, gross
[17:06:56] <dukwon> it's bad enough when smileys are replaced with emojis
