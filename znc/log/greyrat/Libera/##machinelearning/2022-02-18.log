[17:35:50] <soobobobobob> BTW
[17:37:20] <soobobobobob> what is best way to define if model is too simple for a data? My idea try to overfit the model to and if it aint able to do that we need to increase complexity of the model
[17:37:33] <soobobobobob> does this make any sense?
[17:37:42] <soobobobobob> to data*
[17:51:13] <Celelibi> It's notoriously hard to overfit some neural networks.
[17:52:44] <Celelibi> soobobobobob, I'd rather suggest to to train a small model the best you can. Check the performance. Maybe do it a few time to be sure you didn't just get to a poor local optimum.
[17:53:01] <Celelibi> Then repeat on larger and larger models.
[17:53:47] <soobobobobob> yes my idea is pick simplest model as possible and if cannot overfit then increase complexity until cant do better
[17:53:47] <Celelibi> As long as the performance increase (the error rate decrease) with the size of the model, then it means your model was too simple.
[17:54:01] <Celelibi> It's a bad idea.
[17:55:10] <Celelibi> MLPs do overfit quite easily. But you can go much bigger with a convolutional NN before it overfit. If it does at some point.
[17:55:23] <soobobobobob> hmm
[17:59:02] <Celelibi> If your goal is to get a model that has the lowest error rate. And among all the models with the lowest error rate, get the one that's the cheapest to compute.
[17:59:14] <Celelibi> Then you should try to reach these two objectives in that order.

[18:02:48] <Celelibi> But maybe it's not what you want. It's up to you to define what it means for a model to be better than another. And what is the space of all the models you wanna explore.
[18:03:55] <soobobobobob> yeah i should define it: i want it to generialize well
[18:04:05] <soobobobobob> so i consider validation set error
[18:04:47] <soobobobobob> or should i let just GA do the architechture design :D  ?
[18:05:11] <Celelibi> Validation error is some very narrow definition of generalization, but you do you. ^^
[18:05:32] <Celelibi> GA?
[18:06:05] <soobobobobob> genetic algorithm
[18:06:30] <Celelibi> Ah, I was stock on gradient ascent. ^^
[18:06:33] <Celelibi> stuck*
[18:06:47] <Celelibi> BTW, it's some special case of hyperparameter optimization.
[18:07:18] <Celelibi> And neural architecture search. There's plenty of litterature on the subject.
[18:07:53] <soobobobobob> ill take a look :P
[18:08:46] <soobobobobob> at a homework dataset i was able to reach 99% accuracy at the training set and 87% at validation set then 90% accuracy at test set :D
[18:09:49] <Celelibi> There's always some variability.
[18:11:46] <Celelibi> You can even get a better accuracy on the test set than on the training set. Even with a model as simple as a linear regression.

[18:13:24] <Celelibi> But it should be pretty rare. It usually means that the test set has less variation that the training set.
[18:13:55] <soobobobobob> yeah, im not gonna analyze the data for a homework xD
[18:14:08] <soobobobobob> (i know its the most important part)
[18:16:13] <Celelibi> Yeah, the whole point of data science is to know your data.
[18:17:52] <soobobobobob> btw what is the point of a dev/validation set? I understood that it is used to compute error for early stopping
[18:21:27] <Celelibi> It can be used for that.
[18:21:42] <Celelibi> It can also be used to optimize the hyperparameters.
[18:22:13] <soobobobobob> like during the training? <--- It can also be used to optimize the hyperparameters.
[18:23:22] *** Quits: redrum88 (redrum88@user/redrum88) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[18:23:43] <Celelibi> It depends what you call "training" exactly. You set some hyperparameters values, fit your model. Try other HP values, fit again, and so on.
[18:24:07] <Celelibi> And keep the model that yield the best validation score.
[18:24:29] <soobobobobob> yes that is what i meant
[18:24:59] <Celelibi> But beware of the test set! The human is part of the optimization loop. If you look at the error rate on the test set, and then decide to try another model architecture or whatever, you are overfitting the test set.
[18:25:20] <soobobobobob> but the topology of the network u cant change since it wouldnt make any sense :D  ?
[18:26:05] <soobobobobob> during the training :D
[18:27:00] <Celelibi> Not during the fitting of your model. But during the whole training process, sure.
[18:27:16] <soobobobobob> yeah that is what i meant
[18:27:26] <Celelibi> BTW, I think differential neural architecture aim at doing just that.

[23:49:44] <KEPASAAKOMOROO> hi!
[23:49:55] <KEPASAAKOMOROO> about regularization techniques
[23:50:17] <KEPASAAKOMOROO> for example adding L^2 norm to loss function and early stopping
[23:50:53] <KEPASAAKOMOROO> should i combine these methods or use them separately?
[23:51:03] <Evolver> typically combine
[23:51:30] <KEPASAAKOMOROO> yehh thats what i thought
[23:51:40] <Evolver> but there is no hard rule
[23:55:18] <KEPASAAKOMOROO> in early stopping : should i stop the training when validation loss increases sequentially over the limit we define or generally validatioin loss increases here and there over the limit?
