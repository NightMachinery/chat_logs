[05:12:15] <causative> Player001, the other thing that should be said about the image of the curve as a signifier, is that the network in which the signifier appears *includes the external world*
[05:13:01] <causative> that is, the imaginary line trying to solve the maze relates to the maze itself, via your eyes and optic nerve
[05:13:12] <causative> it relates to the physical maze of ink on paper
[05:13:36] <causative> so it is not a network of signifiers that is solely in the minds of humans; it connects externally, outside humans
[05:14:04] <causative> and that's the important part of science - how it connects to the external world, so what the humans think can be corrected by what actually happens in the world
[05:14:42] <causative> and when a domain of discourse fails to connect to something that can unambiguously correct it, the domain tends to "drift" away from anything that's really true - it's just stuff people say, not stuff that's real

[05:57:01] <harveypwca> ONE of the things that's changed MARKEDLY is the health of women. Two things in particular have happened: (a) women's height has increased by over 1 foot and (b) their average breast size has increaded from an A cup to a C cup.
[05:57:53] <harveypwca> Better nutrition and more of it have been determined to be the cause of both.

[06:10:00] <causative> nor did Derrida
[06:10:29] <Player001> well Saussure did
[06:10:41] <causative> good investigative work
[06:13:20] <Player001> the point still stands
[06:13:30] <Player001> because there is only one network
[06:14:21] <Player001> the quote is from Carlo Rovelli by the way
[06:16:26] <causative> well, you may think of it as one network, in the way that the internet is one network, but not everything is equally well connected to everything else
[06:16:49] <causative> there are areas - sets of signifiers - that do not influence others very much. Different fields of study.
[06:17:30] <causative> there may be *some* connections between these fields of study, but most significantly they connect internally to themselves, and externally to their object of study
[06:18:51] <causative> you may consider them as the network of signifiers used by a particular community of people
[06:19:11] <causative> and don't tell me "but all humanity is one community" - no. You understand what I mean.
[06:19:57] <causative> some people are physicists, some are chemists, some are Freudian psychoanalysts, some are psychologists, some are plumbers
[06:20:16] <causative> these different domains of study operate under different subsets of the global network of signifiers
[06:20:43] <causative> they have terms and concepts specific to each field, and they operate by different customs
[06:21:45] <causative> and - some of these networks of signifiers connect more strongly to the external world, allowing more "reality checks" that can reject incorrect ideas within their field
[06:21:53] <causative> and some connect more weakly to the external world
[06:22:40] <causative> and the ones that connect more strongly to the external world, are more trustworthy in their conclusions
[06:23:43] <causative> and the ones that connect more weakly, tend to produce claims that relate more to how appealing the claim is or how closely it matches what those of high social status said

[07:10:01] <causative> ultimately the business of philosophy is deciding on a justified system of belief that makes sense to *you*
[07:10:05] <Player001> it's important to know what you're talking about
[07:10:33] <causative> it's important not to immediately jump to fallacious appeal to authority instead of arguing on the merits

[07:12:31] <Player001> I don't think you know what an appeal to authority is
[07:12:39] <Player001> and when it is a fallacy
[07:12:51] *** Joins: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[07:12:57] <causative> it's always a fallacy in philosophy, because there are no legitimate authorities in philosophy
[07:13:13] <causative> there is no "canonical" philosophy that an authority can dispense to you
[07:13:58] <causative> reading other philosophers is useful to suggest ideas to you - but just because a famous guy said it, doesn't make it true. You have to make the ideas your own, and justify them to yourself on your own terms.
[07:14:14] <causative> otherwise you aren't thinking, just obeying
[07:15:25] <causative> or parroting without understanding
[07:16:21] <amigojapan> Parroting Withought understanding (just kidding)
[07:16:29] <causative> to do philosophy you need to build your own network of justifications:  "I believe X, because I believe Y. I believe Y, because A B and C." and so forth.
[07:17:16] <causative> to debate philosophy, you must dissect the other person's network of justifications, and your own, comparing them to see where the original point of disagreement is
[07:17:22] <Player001> ah, I suppose we have different understandings of philosophy
[07:18:11] <amigojapan> Player001: there is not one single philosophy, there are many
[07:18:45] <Player001> causative: because you seem to take mathematics as a model of philosophy
[07:18:59] <Player001> where there are axioms and theorems
[07:19:24] <causative> there are beliefs and justifications
[07:19:39] <Player001> this is superficial
[07:19:42] <causative> not, usually, axioms and theorems
[07:19:53] <causative> justifications in philosophy are usually not purely deductive or formal
[07:20:22] <causative> and figuring out which beliefs are the premises and which are the conclusions is a challenge in itself; we are not handed a set of axioms for premises
[07:20:26] <causative> we start in the middle
[07:20:29] <causative> not at the beginning
[07:20:43] <harveypwca> Says you.
[07:21:02] <harveypwca> I always start at the end.
[07:21:18] <Player001> turns out the beginning is the end and the end is the beginning
[07:22:08] <harveypwca> Ahhh... but I didn't specify which 'end'. lol
[07:22:09] <causative> there is no end to knowledge - the set of propositions we might believe or disbelieve is infinite
[07:22:38] <harveypwca> only in a linear existence.
[07:23:58] <Player001> oh yeah the propositional model is not a good model for philosophy
[07:24:27] <Player001> "Dogmatism as a way of thinking, whether in ordinary knowledge or in the study of philosophy, is nothing else but the view that truth consists in a proposition, which is a fixed and final result, or again which is directly known. To questions like, “When was Caesar born?”. “How many feet make a furlong?”, etc., a straight answer ought to be given; just as it is absolutely true that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum
[07:24:27] <Player001>  of the squares of the other two sides of a right-angled triangle. But the nature of a so-called truth of that sort is different from the nature of philosophical truth."
[07:24:56] <Player001> Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit paragraph 40
[07:25:27] <causative> and have I said a proposition is a fixed and final result, or that it is directly known?
[07:26:26] <causative> I have not
[07:26:27] <Player001> you continually try to dodge the labor of the negative
[07:27:04] <Player001> by asking me stupid fucking questions
[07:27:05] <causative> dodge in what way?
[07:27:27] <Player001> which are also bad faith
[07:27:51] <causative> you presented a passage in with Hegel objected to thinking about truth as propositions that are fixed and final results, or that are directly known
[07:28:02] <causative> I pointed out to you that I didn't say propositions were either fixed or final results, or directly known
[07:28:14] <causative> that is highly relevant, and it's bad faith to call it bad faith
[07:28:14] *** Joins: llh (~llh@user/llh)
[07:29:10] <Player001> so what are your view of propositions?
[07:30:39] <causative> Well, some things about them first. They are subject to debate. They are not taken as axioms, nor are conclusions usually made about them in a purely deductive way.
[07:31:02] <causative> a person can first be persuaded into thinking a proposition is probably true, and then persuaded the opposite way by more evidence
[07:31:23] <causative> it can go back and forth - and the truth is what they would be persuaded of *in the end*, after they'd seen enough evidence
[07:31:47] <causative> the truth of propositions is both fuzzy and probabilistic:  propositions can be probably mostly true.
[07:32:23] <causative> and they can have more dimensions than that, too.  The truth of a proposition can be represented by a whole probability distribution, or a fuzzy function.
[07:32:55] <Player001> OK
[07:32:57] <causative> it's actually in many ways similar to Hegel's views on dialectic
[07:32:59] <Player001> "But the nature of a so-called truth of that sort is different from the nature of philosophical truth."
[07:33:11] <Player001> causative: no, that is not dialectics
[07:34:34] <causative> it's quite similar - in that we have a process whereby ideas rise and fall over time by comparison with other ideas, tending towards an endpoint of the "ultimate idea"
[07:34:40] <causative> which would be the truth
[07:36:50] <amigojapan> Truth is just treatments about reality, like when I say "I just ate a banana"is truth cause I did
[07:36:55] <Player001> not sure where to begin with that
[07:37:13] <Player001> amigojapan: that sort of truth is what Hegel is critiquing
[07:37:16] <causative> then begin by doubting

[07:38:28] <Player001> amigojapan: it's OK
[07:38:32] <causative> if you can't easily explain why it's wrong, you ought to consider the possibility that it is not wrong
[07:38:36] <causative> like I said, begin by doubting
[07:38:57] <causative> what is not well-justified in your mind, should be doubted
[07:39:11] <causative> and if you can't easily justify why what I said is wrong, then your belief that it is wrong should be doubted
[07:39:45] <Player001> "comparison with other ideas" not how dialectics proceeds
[07:39:50] <amigojapan> Player001: but truth could also be statements about a dream or hallucination
[07:40:06] <causative> hmm? what else do you call the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, aside from a comparison of different ideas?
[07:40:13] <Player001> "endpoint of ultimate idea"
[07:40:25] <Player001> causative: it is immanent to an idea istelf
[07:40:36] <amigojapan> "I had a dream than I was flying"could be a true statement
[07:40:40] <Player001> example: sense-certainty
[07:40:51] <Player001> subject in relation to the object
[07:40:56] <causative> what are you saying is immanent to an idea itself?
[07:41:15] <Player001> first moment of the dialectic: "the object is essential"
[07:41:26] <Player001> second moment: "the subject is essential"
[07:41:35] <Player001> third moment: "it is a unity"
[07:41:35] <causative> back up, you said something that was unclear to me
[07:41:43] <causative> you said "it is immanent to an idea istelf"
[07:41:46] <causative> what is "it"
[07:42:06] <Player001> the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis
[07:42:21] <Player001> although it is more properly concrete, abstract, absolute
[07:42:27] <causative> there are three ideas mentioned there - thesis is an idea, antithesis is an idea, synthesis is an idea
[07:42:33] <causative> which idea are you referring to as "it"?
[07:42:48] <Player001> it is the process
[07:43:18] <causative> so you are saying, "the process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis is immanent to the thesis; and immanent to the antithesis; and immanent to the synthesis."
[07:43:21] <causative> is that what you are saying?
[07:44:41] <Player001> no
[07:44:58] <Player001> we have something we are examining
[07:45:01] <causative> then what are you saying is immanent to what?
[07:45:12] <Player001> and the internal contradictions of this thing drive its development
[07:45:26] <causative> can you give an example of the "something" we are examining?
[07:45:33] <Player001> sense-certainty
[07:46:10] <causative> are we examining sense-certainty itself? or are we examining an object, such as a bar of bronze, *through* sense-certainty?
[07:46:22] <Player001> we are examining sense-certainty itself
[07:47:27] <causative> so are you saying that sense-certainty is immanent to the idea of sense-certainty?
[07:47:42] <causative> when you said "it is immanent to an idea itself"
[07:48:09] <causative> please identify the "it" and the "idea" in that sentence
[07:50:00] <Player001> the thesis is immanent to the idea, and so is the antithesis
[07:50:15] <Player001> and so is the synthesis
[07:50:18] <causative> to which idea?
[07:50:25] <Player001> sense-certainty
[07:51:56] <causative> pardon me, I'm just trying to figure out how you are using words here. Do you also say that the thesis, antithesis, and synthesis are ideas as well, in addition to the sense-certainty? that is, are you saying there are four ideas here, or only one idea (sense-certainty), which has three things immanent to it that are not ideas?
[07:52:28] <Player001> more properly speaking they are moments of this idea
[07:53:34] <causative> one person can be presenting a thesis at the same time as another person is giving their antithesis and a third is giving the synthesis. Do you agree with the preceding statement?
[07:53:47] <harveypwca> Quick! Somebody tell a joke before we all go mad.
[07:54:03] <Player001> complete misunderstanding
[07:56:12] <causative> well, it is possible that I am misunderstanding Hegel.  The understanding I had is that an idea arises, the "thesis"; and then, perhaps decades later, someone may come up with an opposing idea, the "antithesis," which competes with the original.  And then again, perhaps decades later, a third idea unifies the two opposing ideas and is called the "synthesis," which then may become popular and be the new "thesis" for which another "antithesis" may
[07:56:12] <causative> arise
[07:56:37] <Player001> yes that is a misunderstanding
[07:57:38] <Player001> first of all it isn't really historical in this way
[07:58:00] <Player001> you don't have thing thing one, thing two and thing three
[07:58:42] <Player001> you have thing one, aspect one of thing one, aspect two of thing one, and thing one again which is now seen to be thing two
[07:59:52] <Player001> here is another example, from Hegel's Logic
[08:00:07] <Player001> being, pure being. We posit this as thing one
[08:00:43] <Player001> pure being is undifferentiated, and is the same everywhere (aspect one of thing one)
[08:01:35] <Player001> pure being, being undifferentiated, is really nothing. Nothing can be said about this, it is empty of content. (aspect two of thing one)
[08:01:44] *** Quits: Leeloo (~leeloo@user/leeloo) (Quit: Ooh, it gets dark! It gets lonely on the other side from you.)
[08:02:09] <Player001> Now we have becoming. Here we have differentiation, things coming into being and passing away into nothing. This is thing two
[08:02:33] <Player001> now we see that the only way for there to be being is in becoming
[08:02:55] <Player001> the Notion, the Concept of being finds its truth in becoming
[08:03:06] <Player001> this is dialectics
[08:05:09] <causative> ok. from that and from https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hegel-dialectics/ I agree that my understanding is a misreading of Hegel
[08:05:10] <ro-bot-o> [url] Hegel’s Dialectics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) | plato.stanford.edu
[08:05:55] <causative> and that therefore my notion of propositions does not bear too strong a resemblance to Hegel's dialectics
[08:06:19] <causative> but it is also not what he criticized in your quote; propositions as I understand them need not be final or certain, nor need they be axioms
[08:07:24] <causative> belief in a proposition may change and vacillate over time.  So Hegel's criticism of "dogmatism" does not apply.

[08:28:57] <harveypwca> Let's keep our "propositioning" a little more descrete. There might be children and cops listening in.
[08:29:51] <causative> in what you quoted, he only objected to the kind of dogmatic treatment of propositions that views them as fixed and final results, or as axioms directly known

[08:30:51] <causative> not unless I also say that the propositions are fixed and final results, or directly known.

[08:35:02] <Player001> and no, that is not why Hegel says this
[08:37:07] <Player001> in fact, it might be said to be the exact opposite: whereas the truths of propositions such as these are contingent, philosophical truths are necessary

[08:42:35] <causative> it does not seem very clear what he thinks philosophical truth is - he rejects mathematical truth, empirical truth, truth of prophetic utterances

[08:56:37] <Player001> well if anything the original description of propositions as a fixed and final result is closer to philosophical truth than your strange propositions
[08:57:13] <causative> they're not really that strange
[08:57:27] <causative> they're propositions that we can debate over, and be persuaded one way and then the other until finally we may understand

[09:01:58] <causative> or "'X is Y' is probably mostly true in respect A, probably mostly false in respect B, maybe entirely true in respect C"
[09:02:47] <Player001> OK, maybe paragraph 62 will be of some help
[09:02:55] <Player001> "To explain what has been said by examples let us take the proposition God is Being. The predicate is “being”: it has substantive significance, and thus absorbs the meaning of the subject within it. Being is meant to be here not predicate but the essential nature. Thereby, God seems to cease to be what he was when the proposition was put forward, viz. a fixed subject. Thinking [i.e. ordinary reflection], instead of getting any farther w
[09:02:55] <Player001> ith the transition from subject to predicate, in reality finds its activity checked through the loss of the subject, and it is thrown back on the thought of the subject because it misses this subject. Or again, since the predicate has itself been pronounced to be a subject, to be the being, to be the essential reality, which exhausts the nature of the subject, thinking finds the subject directly present in the predicate too: and now, instead of
[09:02:55] <Player001> having, in the predicate, gone into itself, and preserved the freedom characteristic of ratiocination, it is absorbed in the content all the while, or, at any rate is required to be so."
[09:04:35] <Player001> "Similarly when it is said: “the real is the universal”, the real, qua subject, passes away in its predicate. The universal is not only meant to have the significance of a predicate, as if the proposition stated that the real is universal: the universal is meant to express the essential nature of the real. Thinking therefore loses that fixed objective basis which it had in the subject, just as much as in the predicate it is thrown back

[09:13:51] <Player001> Paragraph 61 may be of some help
[09:13:56] <causative> no
[09:13:57] <Player001> "What has been said can be expressed in a formal manner by saying that the nature of judgment or the proposition in general, which involves the distinction of subject and predicate, is subverted and destroyed by the speculative judgment; and the identical proposition, which the former becomes [by uniting subject and predicate], implies the rejection and repudiation of the above relation between subject and predicate. This conflict between the
[09:13:57] <Player001> form of a proposition in general and the unity of the notion which destroys that form, is similar to what we find between metre and accent in the case of rhythm. Rhythm is the result of what hovers between and unites both. So in the case of the speculative or philosophical judgment; the identity of subject and predicate is not intended to destroy their distinction, as expressed in propositional form; their unity is to arise as a harmony of the
[09:13:57] <Player001> elements. The form of the judgment is the way the specific sense appears, or is made manifest, the accent which differentiates the meaning it contains: that the predicate expresses the substance, and the subject itself falls within the universal, is however the unity wherein that accent dies away."

[09:31:16] <Player001> let's start by observing that the meaning of subject is deferred to the meaning of the predicate
[09:31:24] <causative> what does that mean?
[09:31:26] <Player001> causative: LOL
[09:31:38] <causative> that is an equally vacuous statement
[09:31:49] <Player001> but the meaning of the predicate is deferred to the subject as well
[09:31:59] <causative> the meaning of the predicate, "being," is that something exists.  The meaning of the subject, "God," is an omnipotent deity that created the universe.
[09:32:07] <causative> neither meaning is deferred to the other
[09:32:10] <Blankspace> I have pain in the neck
[09:32:16] <causative> or, if you say they are deferred, in what way are they deferred?
[09:32:44] <Player001> just as for Derrida every signifier defers its meaning to the next, and the next, and so on
[09:33:19] <causative> well, that is sort of sensible, but I don't think "defers" is the right word to use
[09:33:29] <causative> each signifier derives its meaning from the context of other signifiers in which it arises
[09:34:13] <causative> but the Hegel quote at hand was that the predicate "absorbs the meaning of the subject within it"

[09:35:25] <causative> this word "absorbs" suggests to me, that the meaning of the subject (God) vanishes, and there is only the meaning of the predicate (Being) which now has both its original meaning and the God meaning, so that God is gone, and Being has become Being+God
[09:35:36] <causative> but that's all absolute drivel
[09:36:30] <causative> and in his next line, Hegel contradicts himself: " The predicate is “being”: it has substantive significance, and thus absorbs the meaning of the subject within it. Being is meant to be here not predicate but the essential nature."
[09:36:43] <causative> first he says the predicate is being. Then he says being is not the predicate.
[09:37:14] <Player001> this is after the absorption of the subject
[09:37:27] <causative> again, the what?
[09:37:42] <causative> the subject is not absorbed, it is still there, it's the word "God"

[09:39:21] <thunder> causative: that was clearly a joke. one person can never know another's thoughts and experience as they do themself. to be understood is to be misunderstood. that's just a fact.
[09:40:39] <causative> alright here is what I think about the passage
[09:40:56] <causative> "God is being" is a pretty meaningless phrase to begin with, but I think Hegel is interpreting it as "God is *nothing but* being"
[09:41:11] <thunder> brigand: I think military arts training is an important prerequisites for the security of equal rights.
[09:41:25] <causative> that is, to say "God is being," in Hegel's interpretation, is to deny any other properties of God, and to say that God is simply the concept of being and nothing else
[09:41:35] <Player001> no, he just means any x is y phroposition
[09:41:39] <Player001> *proposition
[09:41:43] <causative> this is why he says that God is absorbed by the predicate being - because nothing else is left of God, after we have made this assertion
[09:42:28] <causative> that's also why he says " Being is meant to be here not predicate but the essential nature." - that is, he's taking "being" as describing the essential nature of God, denying any other possible properties
[09:42:35] <thunder> brigand: though I'd favour the exercise of restraint in that respect
[09:42:39] <causative> and it's also why he says "Thereby, God seems to cease to be what he was when the proposition was put forward,"
[09:43:02] <causative> also why he says "Or again, since the predicate has itself been pronounced to be a subject, to be the being, to be the essential reality, which exhausts the nature of the subject,"
[09:43:10] <Player001> causative: no, the subject is absorbed and then the predicate is the essential nature
[09:43:15] <causative> he's saying that "being" *exhausts the nature of the subject*
[09:43:34] <causative> that's actually clear, under this interpretation, since it means that God's nature has been entirely described by "Being"
[09:43:39] <causative> leaving nothing else
[09:43:52] <Player001> just as in every proposition, which is Hegel's point

[09:44:16] <Player001> isn't x also z?
[09:44:26] <causative> because "X is Y" does *not* mean that X is identical with Y
[09:44:32] <Player001> but that is its own proposition, x is z
[09:44:44] <Player001> but then we have x is y an z right?
[09:44:49] <causative> "X is Y" like "Greeks are Europeans" means that X is a subset of Y
[09:44:59] <thunder> god originally was a norse pagan word. but now it's essentially a metasyntactic variable (or pure symbol) which has no inherent attached significance except perhaps "bigness" and "power". any more specific significance is up to the mythology/ideology of the speaker/author and can vary widely.
[09:45:50] <Player001> "is a subset of Y" is the predicate so we can replay Hegel's procedure here
[09:45:51] <thunder> so you can't really just throw the term around especially, making any assumptions about the receiver's knowledge or opinion.
[09:46:01] <Player001> so "x is y an z" right?
[09:46:11] <Player001> but "is y and z" is a predicate
[09:46:26] <causative> frankly, statements like "God is being" or "god is light" or "god is truth" or whatever, these are nonsensical claims
[09:46:31] <Player001> so we still have still have this lack of a fixed subject

[09:46:59] <Player001> and "being" with anything else

[09:47:15] <Player001> 'Similarly when it is said: “the real is the universal”'
[09:47:33] <Player001> Hegel's point is valid for all subjects and predicates
[09:47:36] <causative> "God is being" is a religious statement that isn't logical

[09:47:46] <thunder> it's pantheism
[09:48:19] <thunder> for the hindus and a lot of indo-europeans and others, the female is being, and the male is doing.
[09:48:20] <causative> it doesn't mean that God is *a* being
[09:48:30] <thunder> but sometimes reversed also
[09:48:31] <causative> it means that God and Being are somehow identical
[09:48:55] <Player001> ...
[09:49:36] <causative> which is just incorrect, the concept of God is not the same as the concept of just existing
[09:49:43] <causative> a person can believe that things exist without also believing in God
[09:50:06] <thunder> yeah. dude. it's just a cultural label. don't have to get superstitious about it.
[09:50:12] <Player001> no wonder you don't understand Hegel
[09:50:34] <thunder> if they say it means "being", just swap the two words in your head and forgive the obscurantism
[09:50:58] <Player001> God can be replaced with anything else
[09:51:04] <Player001> Being can be replaced with anything else
[09:51:08] <causative> we don't make that kind of religious statement about anything else

[09:52:10] <causative> not that they are examples of chairs

[09:55:50] <Player001> we have in paragraph 61
[09:55:51] <Player001> What has been said can be expressed in a formal manner by saying that the nature of judgment or the proposition in general, which involves the distinction of subject and predicate, is subverted and destroyed by the speculative judgment; and the identical proposition, which the former becomes [by uniting subject and predicate], implies the rejection and repudiation of the above relation between subject and predicate.

[09:59:40] <Player001> we also have the dialectic between particular and universal
[09:59:53] <Player001> causative: superficial
[09:59:53] <thunder> that quote seems to say that by uniting subject and predicate the distinction between them (ie. judgement) simultaneously unites them into a single meaning thus erasing the distinction.
[10:00:03] <Player001> thunder: yes!
[10:01:18] <causative> when we have a proposition with a subject and a predicate, like IsRainingIn(Boston), nothing is subverted or destroyed
[10:01:34] <causative> Boston is still real, the rain is also real, and the whole proposition is distinct from either
[10:01:42] <Player001> causative: dialectical logic is higher than propositional logic
[10:01:51] <thunder> judgement in this sense would be the coalescing of all the unconscious potentialities of meaning from the disjointed subject/predicate into a single unified meaning which excludes all the other potential meanings
[10:02:14] <causative> "X is Y" with the subset interpretation is Aristotelian logic
[10:02:18] <causative> which is lower than propositional logic
[10:02:22] <causative> simpler
[10:02:30] <causative> less expressive
[10:03:47] <causative> you can't express A and (not B or not C) and not (B and D) in the form "X is Y"
[10:04:21] <Player001> we have paragraph 60, which was previous to 62 and 61
[10:04:23] <Player001> In view of the fact that ratiocinative thinking has a content, whether of images or thoughts or a mixture of both, there is another side to its process which makes conceptual comprehension difficult for it. The peculiar nature of this aspect is closely connected with the essential meaning of the idea above described, in fact, expresses the idea in the way this appears as the process of thinking apprehension. For just as ratiocinative thinking
[10:04:23] <Player001> in its negative reference, which we have been describing, is nothing but the self into which the content returns; in the same way, on the other hand, in its positive cognitive process the self is an ideally presented subject to which the content is related as an accident and predicate. This subject constitutes the basis to which the content is attached and on which the process moves to and fro. Conceptual thinking goes on in quite a different
[10:04:23] <Player001> way. Since the concept or notion is the very self of the object, manifesting itself as the development of the object, it is not a quiescent subject, passively supporting accidents: it is a self-determining active concept which takes up its determinations and makes them its own. In the course of this process that inert passive subject really disappears; it enters into the different constituents and pervades the content; instead of remaining in
[10:04:23] <Player001> inert antithesis to determinateness of content, it constitutes, in fact, that very specificity, i.e. the content as differentiated along with the process of bringing this about. Thus the solid basis, which ratiocination found in an inert subject, is shaken to its foundations, and the only object is this very movement of the subject. The subject supplying the concrete filling to its own content ceases to be something transcending. this content,
[10:04:23] <Player001> and cannot have further predicates or accidents. Conversely, again, the scattered diversity of the content is brought under the control of the self, and so bound together; the content is not a universal that can be detached from the subject, and adapted to several indifferently. Consequently the content is in truth no longer predicate of the subject; it is the very substance, is the inmost reality, and the very principle of what is being
[10:04:24] <Player001> considered. Ideational thinking (vorstellen), since its nature consists in dealing with accidents or predicates, and in exercising the right to transcend them because they are nothing more than predicates and accidents – this way of thinking is checked in its course, since that which has in the proposition the form of a predicate is itself the substance of the statement. It is met by a counter-thrust, as we may say. Starting from the subject
[10:04:24] <Player001> , as if this were a permanent base on which to proceed, it discovers, by the predicate being in reality the substance, that the subject has passed into the predicate, and has thereby ceased to be subject: and since in this way what seems to be predicate has become the entire mass of the content, whole and complete, thinking cannot wander and ramble about at will, but is restrained and controlled by this weight of content.
[10:04:25] <Player001> Usually the subject is first set down as the fixed and objective self; from this fixed position the necessary process passes on to the multiplicity of determinations or predicates. Here the knowing ego takes the place of that subject and is the function of knitting or combining the predicates one with another, and is the subject holding them fast. But since the former subject enters into the determinate constituents themselves, and is their
[10:04:25] <Player001> very life, the subject in the second case – viz. the knowing subject – finds that the former, which it is supposed to be done with and which it wants to transcend, in order to return into itself, – is still there in the predicate: and instead of being able to be the determining agency in the process of resolving the predicate – reflectively deciding whether this or that predicate should be attached to the former subject ?
[10:04:26] <Player001> ?? it has really to deal with the self of the content, is not allowed to be something on its own account (für sich), but has to exist along with this content.
[10:04:29] <causative> stop with the excessive pasts
[10:04:31] <causative> use pastebin if you must
[10:04:36] <causative> you know about pastebin?
[10:04:40] <Player001> yes
[10:05:04] <causative> don't paste so many lines at once
[10:05:10] <causative> it's bad etiquette on IRC
[10:05:33] <causative> a couple lines is about the limit
[10:05:43] <causative> beyond that, use pastebin
[10:16:29] <Player001> any, I will see you all later
[10:16:48] <Player001> *anyway
[10:17:36] <Player001> oh, also "God is a being" would have been just fine for Hegel to use as an example
[10:17:57] <Player001> God is absorbed in the predicate
[10:18:01] <Player001> What is God? A being
[10:18:21] <causative> then it wouldn't be "absorbed," it would still be many things other than a being
[10:18:38] <Player001> those other things are their own predicates
[10:19:32] <causative> they would still be other aspects of God that are not "absorbed" by this one aspect of being a being
[10:21:37] <causative> that is, an entity "is" a set of attributes that hold for that entity
[10:21:49] <causative> and the fact that one of the attributes hold does not negate the fact that the other attributes also hold
[10:25:57] <Player001> so Hegel's point stands
[10:26:10] <Player001> we have some entity x
[10:26:22] <Player001> x is a, x is b, x is c, x is d...
[10:26:46] <causative> well, *that* much is not controversial
[10:27:11] <causative> the problem is where you start saying that objects are "absorbed" or "negated"
[10:27:31] <Player001> and for each x is y we have: "To explain what has been said by examples let us take the proposition God is Being. The predicate is “being”: it has substantive significance, and thus absorbs the meaning of the subject within it. Being is meant to be here not predicate but the essential nature. Thereby, God seems to cease to be what he was when the proposition was put forward, viz. a fixed subject."
[10:28:44] <causative> it doesn't absorb anything
[10:28:46] <Player001> we clearly see how the essential nature of each a, b, c, d, is self-evident
[10:29:04] <Player001> since x would not be x then if its nature is exhausted by these predicates
[10:29:24] <causative> what?
[10:29:50] <Player001> and then we negated a predicate
[10:29:50] <causative> the nature of x *is* exhausted by the set of properties that x has
[10:29:55] <Player001> it would become another x
[10:30:38] <causative> what would?
[10:30:39] <Player001> therefore each a, b, c, d is essential for x
[10:31:10] <thunder> here's a tangent.
[10:31:21] <thunder> if I say "chair", that is a concept, because in real terms it can come in many shapes, materials, etc. a chair is not an object comprised of specific materials, but of specific criteria, primarily able to be sat upon. the types of chairs which we may have seen or experienced are associated to the "chair" of the psyche, but are not themselves intrinsically the concept of chair, but simply dangling ornaments upon the branching tree of the concept which
[10:31:21] <thunder> continues ever to accumulate them on it's branches.
[10:32:23] <Player001> we might ask what x is stripped of all predicates
[10:32:27] <Player001> clearly it is nothing
[10:33:00] <thunder> if x were a chair?
[10:33:07] <thunder> or the idea of "chair"
[10:33:13] <Player001> no I'm on my own train of thought
[10:33:18] <thunder> ok
[10:33:26] <thunder> time for me to call it a night anyway
[10:33:45] <Player001> bye, nice talking
[10:33:55] <thunder> likewise. I enjoy your insights
[10:34:30] <causative> it's better to go about these things the way mathematicians do
[10:34:37] <causative> mathematicians have had a long, difficult road towards thinking clearly
[10:34:39] <Player001> no
[10:34:51] <causative> they passed many hurdles along the way, that a naive person wouldn't expect
[10:35:04] <causative> and now they think very clearly
[10:35:41] <causative> we don't need to use this primitive "x is y" business... let's talk instead about first order logic, using modern notation
[10:35:56] <causative> far more flexible and powerful, not so contaminated by superstitions of things being absorbed or destroyed
[10:36:09] <Player001> we're talking philosophy, not mathematics
[10:36:31] <causative> philosophy should draw from mathematics when it needs to be formal and precise
[10:36:39] <causative> it shouldn't try to reinvent the wheel poorly
[10:37:02] <Player001> again, this is where we disagree
[10:38:41] *** Joins: kevin-oculus (~tomys@c188-149-14-10.bredband.tele2.se)
[10:39:08] <causative> what would Hegel do if confronted with a complex mathematical expression, that does not simply reduce to "x is y"?
[10:39:32] <causative> like, idk, green's theorem
[10:39:34] <Player001> maybe he would say that math is for the mathematicians
[10:39:42] <Player001> and philosophy for the philosophers
[10:39:57] <causative> you mean he would give up and fail to analyze it
[10:40:20] <causative> philosophy needs to be universal - it must give an account of every part of human activity, mathematics included
[10:40:38] <Player001> he does in the Logic
[10:40:48] <Player001> although Marx was a little better
[10:41:23] <causative> or just modern logic
[10:42:06] <causative> that's not even considered math, but it's way more involved than the simple "x is y" stuff that Hegel is loopily reading into
[10:42:56] <Player001> LOL
[10:43:50] <causative> like what about even just predicates with arity >1
[10:46:11] <Player001> I think I will go now
[10:46:25] <Player001> you are asking questions about Hegel that would be answered by reading him
[10:46:32] <Player001> and thinking deeply
[10:46:48] <causative> if anything, you've convinced me that Hegel isn't interesting
[10:46:53] <Player001> LOL
[10:47:02] <Player001> you will never be a philosopher
[10:47:09] <Player001> you will never do philosophy
[10:47:13] <causative> you don't know shit
[10:47:19] <Player001> LMAO
[10:48:27] <causative> to *be* a philosopher means to create original philosophy
[10:48:33] <causative> you don't do that
[10:48:56] <Player001> to be a philosopher means to understand philosophy
[10:48:56] <causative> it means to think for yourself about philosophical questions and come up with novel answers
[10:49:00] <Player001> you don't do that
[10:49:12] <causative> no, it's not enough to understand what someone before you did
[10:49:19] <causative> you have to create
[10:49:31] <Player001> you create after you understand
[10:49:55] <causative> yes, but you don't have to subscribe to your particular illogical pantheon
[10:50:11] <Player001> LOL
[10:50:22] <causative> there's more to philosophy than self-reassuring nonsense telling you that science doesn't matter, data isn't real, induction is impossible, reality is consensus
[10:50:29] <Player001> the fact is, I can understand the philosopher you read but not the other way around
[10:50:45] <Player001> *philosophers
[10:51:33] <causative> I say self-reassuring because the liberal arts have a kind of insecurity in the modern age - a worry that they could become irrelevant by advances in science and technology
[10:51:40] <Player001> LOL
[10:51:58] <causative> they see revolution all around them, trains and hydroelectric dams and spaceships and computers, transforming the world in ways anyone can see
[10:52:15] <causative> and they don't like it - it's all work done by people who think very differently from them
[10:52:15] <Player001> superficial
[10:52:28] <Player001> superficial
[10:52:39] <causative> so, the cowards among them make up bedtime stories about how none of the science and technology matters or is real
[10:52:59] <causative> and they like to say there's no difference between the work of the scientists and their work, that it's all just about social narratives
[10:53:15] <Player001> you don't understand what you are talking about
[10:53:22] <Player001> try reading the philosophy of science
[10:53:31] <Player001> or philosophies of technology
[10:53:40] <causative> and if they wrap themselves up in this line of thinking enough, they may be able to forget that they are living in a society built on technology they don't understand
[10:54:03] <Player001> LOL
[10:54:30] <causative> technology has revolutionized society far more than any work of social philosophy
[10:54:39] <Player001> I'll ask you once more: have you read a non-white philosopher before
[10:55:00] <causative> even political philosophy hasn't done as much; we've had democracies before, but nothing changed the world like the industrial revolution
[10:55:03] <causative> not even communism
[10:55:40] <causative> perhaps the greatest name of the 20th century is Fritz Haber, the inventor of the Haber process, which created nitrogen fertilizer out of thin air
[10:56:05] <causative> it is him, more than anyone, that was responsible for the quadrupling of farm productivity, which enabled the subsequent explosion in population
[10:56:13] <Player001> why are you in a philosophy channel if you hate it so much?
[10:56:26] <causative> there's good philosophy and bad philosophy
[10:56:50] <Player001> I see you answered my most recent question before the one before that
[10:56:53] <Player001> :/
[10:57:23] <causative> I already told you I like Thich Nhat Hanh
[10:57:40] <Player001> anyone else?
[10:58:02] <causative> Haber was more influential than any 20th century philosopher, more influential than perhaps even Hitler or FDR
[10:59:10] <Player001> no one else
[10:59:12] <causative> they killed millions, or tens of millions - Haber made possible the lives of billions
[11:01:15] <kevin-oculus> no hitler was original  many countries are just a copy of hitler so hitler is more influntial to the world
[11:01:44] <Player001> hitler was more a copy of colonialism
[11:02:28] <causative> the thing about technology is it just keeps adding to itself
[11:02:40] <causative> it keeps ratcheting up, never back
[11:03:22] <causative> the same can't be said for war or politics
[11:03:53] <causative> a new invention changes the game forever after, or until an even better invention comes out

[11:10:08] <Player001> do you know where your clothes are made?

[11:10:35] *** Quits: NEYi (~NEYi@109.251.216.38) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[11:10:46] <causative> but most of the engineers worked only on a particular component
[11:11:35] <causative> there are a few engineers who were responsible for coordinating the different systems in the phone, and they have a good high-level overview, but they don't know the details of each part
[11:12:02] <causative> and engineers don't know how to do the jobs of all the technicians who manufacture the phone
[11:12:31] <causative> and many of the parts of the phone will be manufactured by other companies
[11:12:48] <causative> so no single person knows how to make a phone

[11:27:54] <causative> I didn't say liberal arts were irrelevant
[11:28:28] <causative> I said that some people in the liberal arts have a worry about being irrelevant, an insecurity
[11:28:29] <Player001> also, you really need to listen to people when they speak
[11:28:46] <causative> not everyone shares this insecurity
[11:29:09] <Player001> because basically no one denies science as a useful way of inquiring into phenomena
[11:31:14] <causative> it's useful because in science, bullshit gets hit over the head by data

[11:32:29] <causative> some fields have smaller bullshit-whacking-sticks, where anything goes. And by "anything goes," I do not mean that everyone wins; I mean that people organize themselves and their ideas based on social dynamics, rather than correspondence to reality.

[11:34:37] <kmh> causative,  sure
[11:34:39] <causative> so, sociology might have a problem from that direction
[11:34:45] <causative> but physics? probably less of an issue.
[11:35:02] <causative> because the people in physics are more mathematically and statistically informed
[11:35:03] <Player001> bullshit is only bullshit retroactively
[11:35:04] <kmh> mathematization delivers sophisticated bullshit in a way
[11:36:06] <causative> mathematics can sell bullshit to people who don't know mathematics
[11:36:06] <kmh> causative, sure the hard sciences a way less affected by it and they have stronger need for mathematization anyhow
[11:36:21] <Player001> now the thing about bigger and smaller sticks is probably itself bullshit
[11:36:31] <causative> it's much harder to use mathematics to sell bullshit to someone who does know mathematics
[11:36:45] <kmh> i mean physics was pretty much the first thoroughly mathematized science and you can't really do physics without it
[11:36:56] <causative> because mathematics is very precise and clear - you can barely help but be clear, if you're doing mathematics.  So your bullshit also will become clear.

[22:30:53] <causative> it's fine and good to describe how humans communicate and agree on ideas - but this description must be placed in the proper context, and the proper context is that everything is happening under the laws of physics, more or less the way physicists have discovered these laws to work.

[22:38:53] <biys> tinwhiskers: well, it seems as though the writer is suggesting that the good philosophy must come from a certain approach of it
[22:39:19] <tinwhiskers> fair enough. "must" is a little strong
[22:39:20] <biys> in that, the only way to come to particular conclusions about the world is to first and fore-most subscribe to this idea
[22:39:36] <biys> then, from there the understandings can be made
[22:41:20] <biys> i would also say that i've heard situations where it's been suggested that we essentially throw the baby out with the bath water prior to starting investigation
[22:41:44] <biys> where preconceived notions on the matter are suggested problematic as a result of their origins
[22:42:29] <biys> this line of thinking is functioning on a certain predetermined axiom that all people must not subscribe to
[22:42:35] <biys> :s/must not/must/
[22:42:38] <biys> that is how i read it anyways
[22:42:51] <tinwhiskers> I think there is a problem where many people take ideas that should merely be thought experiments and incorporate them as part of their reality when the world supports no no such thing.
[22:43:49] <biys> tinwhiskers: here is an example of what i'm talking about

[22:47:20] <biys> "western modernity is the direct antagonistic factor to decolonization"
[22:48:10] <biys> but that is all i really have to say about that. i do agree with what causative is saying... i'm just saying there is commentary against this
[22:48:49] <biys> she says it at some point something like
[22:49:31] <biys> it is sugegsted that it was newton and only newton that sat under a tree and was hit on the head with the apple and thus invented gravity
[22:51:14] <tinwhiskers> I didn't watch it, so I'm a bit lost, sorry.
[22:53:26] <tinwhiskers> We only have to look to QAnon to see how people can believe things that have no basis in reality, and I don't think those sorts of views help us progress much at all. Thought experiements don't need to adhere to reality and we should dream of such things but be wary of accepting them as real.
[22:57:43] <biys> oh sure!
[22:57:53] <biys> but denying the existence of those people seems odd
[22:58:13] <tinwhiskers> that would be odd
[22:58:35] <biys> i would also say that those people hold the ideas that they do as ar esult of a reason
[22:58:42] <biys> i wouldn't go as far as to simply sum them up as idiots
[22:58:47] <biys> some of them are very articulate
[22:58:49] <tinwhiskers> I would say a lack of reasoning
[22:58:58] <biys> sure
[22:59:00] <biys> maybe
[22:59:09] <biys> that seems like a significant overgeneralization though
[22:59:32] <biys> i actually kind of write an editorial on this about two weeks ago
[22:59:49] <biys> where their narrative is something along the lines of a significant distrust of the system and structures as ar esult of their intersectionality (experiences)
[22:59:58] <biys> we can't really invalidate their experiences
[23:00:36] <tinwhiskers> yes, we can. Their made up stories are no more than stories. Pizzagate? John Kennedy Jnr coming back to life, etc. That's not reasonable.
[23:01:02] <biys> can you disprove pizzagate, or remnant of that story?
[23:01:08] <biys> i mean.. Jefery Epstein
[23:01:09] <tinwhiskers> really?
[23:01:16] <biys> lolita express
[23:01:23] <tinwhiskers> I can't disprove unicorns and fairies either
[23:02:06] <biys> the narratives exist because there's ideas, regardless if you subscribe to them
[23:02:22] <biys> those ideas may or not be valid depending on the programming within your processor
[23:02:36] <biys> it goes something like this
[23:02:44] <biys> we don't read shakespeare so we can understand how to think
[23:02:50] <tinwhiskers> yes. the ideas may be useful thought experiments but do not reflect reality and shouldn't be taken as such
[23:02:50] <biys> we read shakespeare to understand what to think
[23:02:59] <biys> who says they don't reflect reality?
[23:03:02] <biys> they don't reflect YOUR reality
[23:03:14] <biys> pizzagate is entirely not outside the eralm of possibilities
[23:03:15] <tinwhiskers> *eye roll*
[23:03:18] <biys> to suggest it is is nonsense
[23:03:30] <causative> it's not that they are idiots, it's that they say the things they want to be true and that they think will gain them social status among their like-minded peers
[23:03:40] <causative> they don't care *what* is true, just what they *want* to be true
[23:03:45] <biys> yah
[23:03:46] <tinwhiskers> yeah
[23:03:55] <biys> it's loosely connected ideas
[23:04:02] <biys> when i think of it i think of a detectives office
[23:04:05] <biys> with pictures and string and push pins
[23:04:12] <biys> but all the strings dangle loosely
[23:04:16] <biys> they aren't tight
[23:04:55] <biys> i kind of use this analogy to describe it.  i can wake up in the morning and get dressed and eat breakfast and drive to work and go for coffee and on the way to getting back fro my coffee break i fall and skin my knee
[23:05:05] <biys> i could SAY that i skinned my knee because i woke up in the morning
[23:05:08] <biys> that isn't inaccurate
[23:05:23] <biys> is it the most accurate?
[23:05:24] <biys> not really
[23:05:38] <biys> it is likely as a result of the crack in the sidewalk that i tripped and skinned my knee
[23:05:46] <tinwhiskers> this seems like another straw man
[23:05:58] *** Joins: kariosfox (~kariosfox@176.221.125.192)
[23:06:04] <biys> care to elaborate on that?
[23:06:36] <tinwhiskers> QAnon is not merely describing reality in loose terms. It's just prophecies and nonsense.
[23:06:53] <biys> that seems like a drastic oversimplification
[23:06:57] <biys> to fit your narrative

[23:08:06] *** Joins: kariosfox (~kariosfox@176.221.125.192)
[23:08:47] <biys> so would you say that the idea that those that are in the upper echelons of the social structure are void of problematic behaviour?
[23:08:57] <biys> such as paedophilia?
[23:09:13] <biys> i'd say it's not outside the realm of possibilities
[23:09:19] *** Quits: white5moke (~white5mok@ip72-219-109-30.oc.oc.cox.net) (Quit: Leaving...)
[23:09:33] <biys> and given the evidence and seeing the jeffery epstein niformation and who he rubbed shoulders with
[23:09:44] <biys> i'd say it seems completely possible something like that could be going on
[23:09:58] <biys> it isn't "nonsense"
[23:09:59] <tinwhiskers> well, I would not suggest pedophiles don't exist but the narrative that all democrats are pedophiles and that democrat government runs this in an organised fashion is simply far detached from reality.
[23:10:23] <biys> why would you say that though?
[23:10:31] <biys> i mean.  i kind of agree that it's outlandish in that context
[23:10:54] <biys> but i won't go as far as to say it's impossible
[23:11:11] <causative> it's unjustified, is what it is
[23:11:18] <causative> we should only hold beliefs if we can justify them
[23:11:26] <biys> should
[23:11:32] <tinwhiskers> right. should.
[23:12:24] <causative> just because something might conceivably be true, and just because it would make the other tribe look bad, or our tribe look good, doesn't mean it is true
[23:12:43] <biys> i don't really think about it in make this or that tribe look good or bad
[23:12:50] <biys> i think all people are inhererntly problematic
[23:12:52] <causative> that's the logic they use, whether they are aware of it or not
[23:13:08] <darklambda> some people believe in the goodness of others.. even though they don't think of justifying them...
[23:13:30] <causative> most people do not directly deal with the truth - they deal with what authorities tell them is true
[23:13:31] <darklambda> perhaps, they shouldn't.. heheh
[23:14:23] <causative> not all authorities, just their own tribal-affiliated authorities
[23:18:35] <causative> to a certain way of thinking, the weighing evidence and deciding what is true is a right reserved for the rulers, and trying to do it yourself would be insubordination
[23:21:04] * darklambda had a ruler once
[23:21:09] <causative> *the weighing of evidence

[23:42:33] <biys> idk about that
[23:42:47] <biys> i th ink it's more-so a matter of being provided shitty options
[23:42:53] <biys> like coke or pepsi
[23:43:07] <biys> a lot of people don't really spend any significant amoun tof time thinking about anything now days
[23:43:23] <biys> so they're kind of shown a couple or a few options
[23:43:34] <biys> and then the align with one of those options given their understanding of the world
[23:43:43] <biys> which is formulated by their intersectionality
[23:43:49] <Player001> maybe coke or pepsi isn't the best example
[23:43:57] <biys> it's a mr.robot reference
[23:44:05] <Player001> oh haha
[23:44:50] <biys> so either they believe the narrative that the democrats are humanitarians with the best interest of all epople in mind (while coming to grips with the problem that the primary actors in the organization are problematic by assocaition)
[23:45:07] <biys> or they believe that the democrats aren't humanitarians and the primary actors are actually bad people
[23:45:32] <biys> or anywhere in between there
[23:45:39] <biys> but the thign is peopel don't think for themselves now days
[23:45:57] <biys> they might thrash around for a bit wondering what to think
[23:46:04] <biys> then find that 4 or 5 of their peers believe this or that
[23:46:13] <biys> and then just subscribe to that in oder to prevent alienation
[23:46:30] <biys> because there's also a matter of group think amongst the tribe you're affiliated
[23:46:49] <biys> and if you start to stray too far from that you'll alienate yourself from your support gruop
[23:46:52] <biys> but anyways
[23:47:03] <biys> i think there's a drastic oversimplification that's taking place here with this conversation
[23:48:56] <biys> and i think it's the biggest problem we have right now
[23:49:14] <biys> is there is a group that perceives they're intellectually superior
[23:49:18] <biys> which i mean... they very well could be
[23:49:31] <biys> but when you walk about a group of people thinking you're "the shit"
[23:49:43] <biys> it's likely others will agree and think you are shit
[23:57:59] <causative> people don't, in general, understand the concept of debating the evidence
[23:58:07] <causative> they don't understand elenchus
[23:58:15] <causative> if you challenge their ideas, they will insult you, they won't try to reason with you
[23:58:36] <causative> because it's not a matter of reason for them, it's a matter of identity, especially tribal identity
[23:59:41] <causative> they consider argument as an always bad thing, and among them, perhaps it is, because they don't know how to do it without immediately getting mad and insulting people
