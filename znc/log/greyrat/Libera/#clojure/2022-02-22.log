[08:20:27] <ggb> selfsymmetric-mu: I can get a really good contract gig within the next two weeks if I want one.
[08:21:06] <ggb> A good recruiter means freedom and safety to me.
[08:23:17] <ggb> I was in a role at prior employer that rapidly hit a breaking point. I called on Monday and said, "Clare, get me out." I had a signed contract with a great client that ended up lasting 18 months. It was a great opportunity for my own professional development and a great boon to my resume.
[08:25:45] <ggb> Even bad recruiters on LinkedIn give me a good feel for what job opportunities exist and what salaries are available.
[08:26:24] <technomancy> huh, I've never had a recruiter contact me with a salary range
[08:27:20] <ggb> "$Recruiter, thanks so much for reaching out. Currently, I'm happy with my current role at $job. Just out of curiosity, what would a role like this typically pay for a candidate with my experience?"
[08:27:32] <technomancy> yeah I guess you would have to actually respond to get more info, haha
[08:27:46] <ggb> Roughly 50% hit rate on salary info from a simple copy/paste.
[08:28:29] <technomancy> about 70% of the recruiter emails I get are either some abhorrent company or somewhere so early-stage it'd be really high risk.
[08:28:45] <technomancy> but then again my resume specifies "will not relocate to san francisco" so that might help filter out a lot of stuff
[08:28:54] <technomancy> less nowadays than it used to.
[08:29:31] <ggb> I've also made a habit of interviewing pretty seriously at least once every 8-12 months in my career.
[08:30:56] <ggb> It's good practice. You'll eventually meet a recruiter worth keeping in touch with. And, again, safety and freedom.

[12:05:53] <Para> re: recruiters, the funniest thing here in Finland is that they try to apply the same tactics (esp. since a lot of UK companies try to fish talent across entire Europe) but because our market is quite small and people tend to talk to each other, everyone sort of knows the job positions and sometimes even the salary ranges beforehand :)
[12:07:39] <Para> For example Epic, not the game one, the terrible hospital one, entered Finland some years ago and they did a blanket recruitment effort. They tried to get all the CTOs and whatever first, offering us ex-Soviet bloc salaries :D That didn't work, so they did the second round with outsourced recruiting using the "our large international health care customer is looking for <fancy title> to work on
[12:07:41] <Para> <healthcare context which has like two providers in this whole country>" kind of ads.

[14:38:20] <v3ga> Para: gotcha gotcha...
[14:38:24] <sobel> i think the machine category you'd want is going to be "t3.small" but i would pick ARM over Intel and i believe you get an even better price/perf
[14:38:50] <Para> Price optimization wise yeah, ARM is better.
[14:39:00] <Para> Perf optimization for heavy CPU loads, AMD wins.
[14:39:06] <v3ga> yeah, i just saw t3.small. That looks fine.  Any potential hangups with ARM?
[14:39:10] <sobel> my cloud bill for a small business (~10 servers and a couple TB of S3 storage) is $400US/mo
[14:39:33] <Para> ARM needs ARM compiled binaries, of course, so you need to be a bit more mindful with that.
[14:40:17] <sobel> if you're already well served by debian packages, you'll be about equally happy with ARM
[14:42:13] <sobel> if you don't keep a setup.sh like an executable blog post as you setup your new cloud server, at least keep a setup.txt that's copy-paste-executable. ansible & friends are overkill for this.

[14:45:07] <Para> the great part about that is that 1) the documentation works because it really is just my notes of all the dumb stuff I tried to get things working and 2) it's copy-pasteable afterwards.
[14:45:17] <v3ga> Yeah, I write snippets in org files for everything but I should make a line by line process for launching

[14:50:17] <v3ga> do people do that?
[14:50:24] <sobel> BugZilla was a great case study. Mozilla had a good reputation, I guess. So surely their bug tracker would be all that, right? Turns out, it's great *only for them*
[14:50:31] <goodger> v3ga: like a fiver a month?
[14:50:32] <Para> v3ga: I'm sure some do.
[14:50:35] <sobel> v3ga: they absolutely do, and it's inexpensive
[14:50:44] <Para> One bug tracker I still kinda miss is trac.
[14:50:49] <v3ga> *grinch grin* 
[14:50:54] <Para> trac with SVN was very nice
[14:51:30] <sobel> there's a level of intricacy that needs to be built between the vcs and the tracker that it seems like all the modern incarnations shrink from
[14:51:43] <Para> Yeah.
[14:52:05] <Para> Jira's current cloud version can only be bound to a single GitHub organization, for example. And it has to be the whole organization, not just one team.
[14:52:24] <yeik-the-spik[m]> <rovanion> "Para: Org exports to Confluence...." <- I had an issue with that path last time I tried. I think we had a fancy version  of confluence that did not support confluence's own markdown (go figure). But I just exported to regular markdown and installed a markdown extension to confluence.
[14:52:26] <sobel> my infra TODO list has gitea on it, with some eventual hope of integrating a tracker that i like better than jira but for now it's hard to beat entrenched groupware
[14:53:19] <Para> I've been thinking for a while now to create a sort of generic process state machine thing that I could use to implement everything.
[14:53:26] <rovanion> yeik-the-spik[m]: Well of course. And onether thing: Why is the markup language for Confluence and Jira completely different?
[14:53:42] <sobel> Para: that single org constraint directly impedes my plans to expand my professional service beyond my current employ. i'd have to sign in to multiple jiras. :(
[14:53:49] <v3ga> ok thanks, that was helpful....now to do some readjusting.
[14:53:54] <Para> But like my IDEA about the formatting editor, one of the main driving forces would of course be spite; just becaus I could define everything as state machines wouldn't be great at all.
[14:54:18] <sobel> it's been a while since i engaged in proper spite-driven development
[14:54:27] <sobel> but i definitely wrote a state machine about it, so..

[14:57:21] <Para> To be on topic for a bit, it's interesting how seemingly simple ideas are reimplemented multiple times. I mentioned lein-git-version plugin a while back, and I've now been using it, and I've sort of written my own now.
[14:57:48] <sobel> build tools in general
[14:58:05] <Para> My version is, naturally, so data driven it really is a "vector of vectors of lookup instructions to string" thingy.

[14:58:30] <sobel> true facts
[14:58:43] <sobel> reactive is my new vocabulary word for over-engineered
[14:59:37] <Para> Without full pasting, the main function currently looks like when called `(revision-generator2 {:tag "v0.0.0" :ahead? true ...} {:format :semver})` which is really innocent until one looks into what that :format actually means.
[14:59:53] <Para> And yes, there's a two there - the first version worked but obviously wasn't generic enough!
[15:00:23] <sobel> there better not be a version 0 or 1 :)
[15:00:30] <sobel> we always number temp copies starting with 2

[15:03:53] <sobel> oh my, the fizzbuzz implementation with some-fn is entirely instructive. so that's what fizzbuzz is for.
[15:03:57] <Para> The some-fn part here is that for each keyword namespace I have a separate resolver function.
[15:04:01] <sobel> we have a legit use case, finally!
[15:05:06] <Para> The :rev lookup function is espcially dirty; I use regex named capture groups to extract parts from the git tag and one can then refer to those through the lookup.
[15:05:46] <Para> Which, by the way, is something Clojure doesn't support in its regex functions so it's done through Java interop.
[15:05:48] <sobel> i've not been able to build an app without regex in a long time

[17:07:25] <v3ga> TimMc: def not...i've been building a very specfic tool. Like it'll allow me to group my thoughts...or say if i'm reading a book I can write reviews/thoughts per chapter in multiple posts and have them grouped together.  I have a lot of 'odd' stuff in mind but it's fun.... TO ME
[17:07:52] <v3ga> also kind of going for a cyberpunk aura, beyond just theming....

[17:17:06] <sobel> bottom line - be sure you can do all your development and testing locally. you don't want to fight the hosting AND your app at the same time.
[17:17:52] <sobel> in the interest of divide & conquer, the cloud is a pretty clear 'ops' division line for me.

[17:46:21] <TimMc> I switched away from Wordpress a year or so ago and was unhappy with the alternatives I tried out, and just ended up writing my own static site generator in a couple of evenings.
[17:47:14] <egli> v3ga: sorry I missed the beginning what is this tool that you are building?
[17:47:15] <TimMc> There's no configuration. All the templates and stuff are just intermingled with the code. If someone wants to fork it they can, but it's probably never going to be "themable" or whatever.

[19:57:03] <devn> Slack is down. Now is the time. Rise up again, IRC.
[19:58:06] <technomancy> every previous time slack went down we went on an internal IRC server but this time IT sent an email saying to join google chat à²¥_à²¥
[19:58:35] <technomancy> hard not to take it personally when I literally just started writing my own IRC server a couple weeks ago
[20:01:59] <rovanion> I sthere a shorthand for #(or (int? %) (nil? %) (string/blank? %)), perhaps named any-pred? used like (any-pred int? nil? string/blank?)?
[20:02:42] <aphyr> rovanion: I've occasionally defined `f-or` `f-and` etc which do this
[20:02:53] <aphyr> I don't thiiink there's an (efficient) idiom for it
[20:03:15] <ggb> Efficient in terms of expression in the core language? Or there's a performance concern?
[20:03:23] <aphyr> Both, really
[20:03:48] <rovanion> technomancy: Perhaps you should advertise your IRC-server on Google Talk?
[20:04:21] <technomancy> rovanion: rogue marketing!
[20:04:29] <ggb> Naively, I'd expect performance to be fine. `or` short-circuits appropriately. So that lambda should evaluate only as many tests as necessary to get to a `true` result.
[20:04:53] <aphyr> Yeah, the lambda's fine
[20:05:17] <technomancy> aphyr: can you remind me what your maybe-not-an-anaphora use case we talked about a while back was?
[20:09:20] <aphyr> Oh! Uhhh let's see
[20:09:55] <aphyr> Oh yeah, when you need to write a macro that generates unqualified symbols that aren't vars
[20:10:19] <technomancy> ahh right; introducing an identifier that's not a first-class value but acts as a special form of sorts. thanks.
[20:10:47] <aphyr> For instance, if you've got a macro that provides (early-return ... (return 3)), and you want to then write a macro that *generates* a form that uses early-return, it has to be able to emit a `(return 3)` form even though return isn't a real var
[20:10:55] <technomancy> yeah thanks; I remember now
