[09:00:38] <HubertFarnsworth> yup
[09:00:39] <Cryowolf> they've moved up Shield Hero too many times...I wonder if they'll even air it next year, it got moved from Winter to Summer
[09:00:59] <HubertFarnsworth> yuuji is good 
[09:01:25] <Cryowolf> we'll probably get Tensura S3, Tanya S2, Overlord S4 before Shield Hero
[09:01:45] <Cryowolf> and yes they're all basically announced. Only one without a clear announcement is Tensura
[09:03:17] <Cryowolf> Arifureta also getting a S2, which is weird cause of how poor the adaptation in season 1 was. The art was horrible with the 3d stuff. But I know why, I know it's cause they animated hald the season but took so many liberties to change the story and the MC that the author veto'd it. Then they had to make the entire season with a budget for half a season
[09:03:22] <Cryowolf> remake it
[09:03:35] <Cryowolf> So I guess season 2 is the second chance kind of thing to save it

[10:31:50] <PancakeMatsuri> but it was your dog?
[10:31:58] <MootPoot> it was me, dio!
[10:32:12] <PancakeMatsuri> well, it happens
[10:32:17] <MootPoot> TLDR 
[10:32:24] <MootPoot> I used a old router as a network switch
[10:32:33] <MootPoot> forgot to turn off DCHP
[10:32:41] <MootPoot> you know what happened next...
[10:33:29] <PancakeMatsuri> but if devices don't treat it as a DHCP server, it should be fine
[10:33:31] <PancakeMatsuri> no?
[10:33:49] <MootPoot> yes, but if all the devices are set to dynamic...
[10:33:58] <MootPoot> they'll try anything
[10:34:24] <ButterNoodle> lol
[10:34:36] <ButterNoodle> not just anything
[10:34:37] <MootPoot> sometimes I wonder if I should be in IT
[10:34:40] <MootPoot> with my IQ
[10:34:45] <MootPoot> why didn't I think of this

[10:34:57] <ButterNoodle> the fastest device to respond to the broadcast
[10:35:04] <ButterNoodle> it happens
[10:35:33] <ButterNoodle> I typically dont have routers that have dhcp auto setup..
[10:35:48] <MootPoot> you have the space and the money for that enterprise shit
[10:35:54] <ButterNoodle> then again.. routers and switches are separate
[10:35:58] <MootPoot> I'm just using consumer gear with nice GUIs

[10:36:27] <ButterNoodle> those are gonna replace all my cisco routers
[10:36:36] <MootPoot> TP-link on every network node
[10:36:48] <ButterNoodle> mikrotik is latvian.. I think
[10:36:51] <MootPoot> it is
[10:37:01] <MootPoot> latvian girls are cute
[10:37:09] <ButterNoodle> they are too poor to be chinese police state
[10:37:11] <MootPoot> go on a date with a latvian girl while sipping a latte
[10:37:44] <MootPoot> you run that mikrotik router too?
[10:37:47] <MootPoot> the hap AC one
[10:37:55] <MootPoot> that Emmeka has as well
[10:37:59] <ButterNoodle> I have an ac2
[10:38:05] <ButterNoodle> and the 5008 lab router
[10:38:12] <ButterNoodle> well I have a few of them other than that
[10:38:16] <ButterNoodle> but those 2 are the best ones
[10:38:22] <ButterNoodle> teh 5008 is a monster
[10:38:29] <ButterNoodle> worth the $200
[10:38:43] <ButterNoodle> 10gig capable
[10:39:12] <ButterNoodle> the ac2 is the 2nd best.. and @ 65$ its hard to beat
[10:39:24] <ButterNoodle> it will route gig
[10:39:41] <MootPoot> 65?
[10:39:42] <MootPoot> wtf
[10:39:46] <MootPoot> its 125 here
[10:39:52] <MootPoot> like 115 USD
[10:39:56] <ButterNoodle> price just dropped on amazon
[10:40:00] <ButterNoodle> it was 80
[10:40:20] <MootPoot> ah
[10:40:34] <MootPoot> but tbh for that price I could just get a 3 node mesh setup
[10:40:41] <ButterNoodle> y
[10:40:50] <ButterNoodle> do you need that?
[10:40:55] <MootPoot> yes
[10:41:01] <MootPoot> I live in a very...vertical house
[10:41:04] <ButterNoodle> and thats a different purpose all together
[10:41:12] <MootPoot> so signal really dies from one floor to the next
[10:41:33] <ButterNoodle> sounds like u need the function of that over routing anyway
[10:42:02] <ButterNoodle> fyi.. mesh just means they will connect to each other.. roaming is done on the clinet
[10:42:45] <MootPoot> right now I have main router - a tp link AX 10 at the top floor , a repeater wired up with powerline at the ground level , and MoCa (from top to basement floor) with another unit in the basment 
[10:43:01] <MootPoot> literally the only way to get a reliable network
[10:43:45] <MootPoot> I have somewhere like 30 wifi clients
[10:43:56] <MootPoot> and 10 or so wired
[10:44:13] <ButterNoodle> u need ap on every floor
[10:44:43] <MootPoot> depends on the floor - highest to 1 lower is okay
[10:44:58] <MootPoot> the ground floor is concrete - no signal into the basement
[10:45:08] <MootPoot> even though there is a repeater in the garage on the ground floor
[10:45:14] <ButterNoodle> woah
[10:45:23] <ButterNoodle> cement celing?
[10:45:24] <MootPoot> so no matter how you fuck it , you need a threesome of APs
[10:45:46] <ButterNoodle> *semen ceiling?
[10:45:51] <MootPoot> yes
[10:45:55] <MootPoot> lol
[10:45:58] <ButterNoodle> thats a nice bomb shelter
[10:46:09] <MootPoot> the ground floor floor is cement 
[10:50:13] <MootPoot> PopOS seems to run perfectly 
[10:51:45] <MootPoot> Mouse still dosent work , I think I left something unplugged 
[10:52:17] <MootPoot> But aside from that might just actually go to Linux on it 
[10:52:33] <MootPoot> Win11 is nice and all but I already have a windows box

[14:31:45] <KatrinValerie> Though that was years ago
[14:31:57] <KatrinValerie> Like 
[14:32:01] <KatrinValerie> 4-5years ago
[14:32:20] <amigojapan> Ouch KatrinValerie that's crazy
[14:32:49] <HubertFarnsworth> what about now KatrinValerie?
[14:32:51] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: why would you sleep so little?
[14:33:08] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I just worded it dramatically, basically they could not fix my sleep issues with therapy or meds, so I got less than 4hours of sleep a night most of the time

[14:33:23] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: but I still managed to sit through 6hours of simulated work

[14:33:43] <amigojapan> I see
[14:34:09] <KatrinValerie> But atleast they noted that I can't do manual labour
[14:34:38] <KatrinValerie> but since they did not care to diagnose the physical issues they've all been written off as psychosomatic
[14:35:02] <HubertFarnsworth> what about coding or one of those programming jobs KatrinValerie? can you do that now?
[14:35:07] <KatrinValerie> and since I got that label it has been pointless trying to get not so obvious stuff diagnosed
[14:35:25] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: I don't think so, but mostly because I lack formal qualification.
[14:35:25] <HubertFarnsworth> !c psychosomatic
[14:35:26] <ImoutoBot> HubertFarnsworth: Psychosomatic medicine is an interdisciplinary medical field exploring the relationships among social, psychological, and behavioral factors on bodily processes and quality of life in humans and animals.
[14:35:48] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: in the context of psychiatry it just means the symptoms are all in your head
[14:35:51] <KatrinValerie> lol
[14:35:58] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: get certifications

[14:39:31] <KatrinValerie> If I got a cisco cert, I still couldn't get a job with that, because I would also need a job certification in computer science or something similar to stand a chance to get hired.
[14:39:55] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: we also have school based technical degrees etc, if you do not follow the default pipeline in Germany, you are simply out of luck.
[14:40:55] <KatrinValerie> I dropped out of school because of my health and only got a joke of a school cert that is not recognized anywhere but bavaria
[14:42:02] <KatrinValerie> Getting to study for a bsc was the best chance I had in decades, but that chance was blown by corona and transphobic violence
[14:42:17] <KatrinValerie> it really sucks to be thrown back so hard after finally managing to get back up on my feet.
[14:42:52] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I am sure things like the Japanese language proficiency test have some effect

[14:47:45] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: I left the city where I studied, because it was too dangerous to live there as a trans person
[14:47:46] <HubertFarnsworth> what about cooking KatrinValerie? are you good at cooking?
[14:48:08] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: yes, but way too slow to apply that in a professional context.
[14:48:10] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't know if you can handle work in kitchen
[14:48:28] <KatrinValerie> Otherwise I think I would like it, but I would also get hooked on stims.
[14:48:39] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: all chefs here are on amphetamines
[14:49:03] <HubertFarnsworth> woah
[14:49:06] <KatrinValerie> Sober chefs are a myth that only exist in fantasyland
[14:49:18] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: the whole service industry in Germany has that issue
[14:49:24] <KatrinValerie> As well as factory working
[14:49:48] <KatrinValerie> I don't think I want to work in an environment like that.
[14:49:51] <HubertFarnsworth> how about making something KatrinValerie? like chocholates or some snacks and sell them online?
[14:50:59] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: I have been thinking about that already, but regulations are tight and I would need extra rooms to prepare these things and adhere to very high hyghene standards.
[14:51:28] <HubertFarnsworth> see if you can do that
[14:51:34] <KatrinValerie> That's basically any buisness idea I have ever had, not feasible in Germany because of burocracy or too high costs
[14:52:04] <KatrinValerie> And I do not have the capacity to make a proper business plan right now.
[14:52:34] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: when I am better I might try for something, but I will have to make an actual plan and such
[14:52:37] <HubertFarnsworth> hmm, I guess for now focus on health issues
[14:53:04] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: mhm
[14:53:35] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: I have too many ideas that just are too expensive to get to the market
[14:54:01] <KatrinValerie> Like fully automized bioreactors for bioethanol
[14:54:25] <HubertFarnsworth> think of simpler things
[14:54:30] <KatrinValerie> Would couple that with algea farming, so you basically turn solar into chemical energy 
[14:54:51] <KatrinValerie> Also, there are many organic waste materials you could use
[14:55:02] <HubertFarnsworth> without money, all ideas are meh unless you find someone to finance, it's harsh but that's how it is

I told you, go to Manila and show up at an anime convention and flash your US passport, you'll have legions of Filipino cosplayer girls to choose from
[14:56:35] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: the best of my ideas require highly qualified R&D teams q.q
[14:56:37] <HubertFarnsworth> I sound rude but that's how it is
[14:57:56] <KatrinValerie> and lots of them are probably not feasable in a capitalistic system
[14:58:11] <HubertFarnsworth> what about librarian certification or something like that?
[14:58:33] <KatrinValerie> Liberies are call and all, but my dust allergy
[14:58:36] <KatrinValerie> cool
[14:58:38] <KatrinValerie> not call
[14:59:01] <HubertFarnsworth> how much dust is there in libraries?

[14:59:24] <KatrinValerie> She's awesome, just building a pinball machine from scratch like that
[14:59:56] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: a whole lot of dust collects on the books, sorting books into the right places is part of a librarians work
[15:00:06] <KatrinValerie> So you end up being exposed to a lot of dust
[15:00:22] <KatrinValerie> I mean, I would probably love it otherwise
[15:01:26] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't think there would be that much dust
[15:01:48] <HubertFarnsworth> anyway, what else is there?
[15:02:01] <HubertFarnsworth> how about working in a cafe or something?
[15:03:18] <HubertFarnsworth> if you can do barista course, can you get a job?
[15:04:13] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: apparently Japanese women find people that work part time at a cafe very attractive
[15:04:51] <HubertFarnsworth> that's not just japanese women though
[15:05:01] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: during a pandemic, as a high risk patient, that sounds like a bad idea
[15:05:01] <amigojapan> I see
[15:05:29] <KatrinValerie> I managed to dodge an infection so far and I need to stay vigilant till I can get my booster
[15:06:18] <KatrinValerie> I just hope the pandemic ends soon and takes the anti-vaxxers with it
[15:06:57] <amigojapan> I feel guilty cause I am happy that Omicron appeared, cause that means the immigration office will be enough in January
[15:07:15] <amigojapan> Well be empty*
[15:07:33] <HubertFarnsworth> how about starting something online KatrinValerie? 
[15:07:33] <KatrinValerie> honestly at this point I have lost all patience with these people, it is willful ignorance and I have no symphaty left for them at all
[15:08:12] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: I have looked into a few things there, but then I run into the issue of lacking credentials and qualification
[15:08:23] <KatrinValerie> so I need to either build a portfolio or get certs again
[15:08:44] <KatrinValerie> but again, I probably need to spend more time on my health
[15:09:03] <KatrinValerie> it's just very draining when you have had horrible experiences with the medical system.
[15:09:09] <HubertFarnsworth> huh
[15:09:18] <HubertFarnsworth> it sucks
[15:09:34] <KatrinValerie> Let's just say doctors start to act really dumb when they notice you are trans.
[15:10:04] <KatrinValerie> Then they convieniently ignore what you tell them because they already have a response ready to all your issues without needing to investigate further
[15:10:13] <KatrinValerie> It's awlays, yeah that's the hormones
[15:10:24] <KatrinValerie> For things that are absolutely unrelated
[15:10:52] <KatrinValerie> When you have to see multiple doctors to just have something looked at, it's frustrating
[15:11:13] <KatrinValerie> and even more so when you have to wait half a year for a specialist appointment, just to have them dismiss everything because I take hormones.
[15:12:35] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: what kind of hormones was Alan Turing made to take?
[15:13:04] <HubertFarnsworth> KatrinValerie: write a book!
[15:13:13] <HubertFarnsworth> detailing everything

[15:16:03] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: never looked into the details, but it must have been horrible for him, he was put on some estrogens from all I know
[15:16:38] <KatrinValerie> If you do not want your body to feminize estrogen will make you really unhappy for sure
[15:17:20] <amigojapan> I see. History blames his suicide in the hormone treatment KatrinValerie 
[15:17:59] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: if you put a cis person on cross sex hormones you basically induce gender dysphoria
[15:18:25] <amigojapan> He was homosexual
[15:19:00] <KatrinValerie> cis just means that gender identity aligns with gender assigned at birth, so Turing was cis in that sense
[15:19:13] <amigojapan> I see
[15:19:52] <KatrinValerie> But really, having anything done to your body that you dont want will make you depressed
[15:20:28] <KatrinValerie> just in the same way as being denied autonmy over your body
[15:20:52] <amigojapan> Hmm
[15:21:04] <KatrinValerie> Ah well, I might not have to tolerate that for much longer
[15:21:26] <amigojapan> I don't think I am prone to gender dysphoria
[15:21:54] <KatrinValerie> Can't know before you try and why try if you don't want what transition has to offer *shrug*
[15:22:17] <KatrinValerie> But there are probably people that don't care all that much about that stuff.
[15:22:27] <amigojapan> Yup
[15:22:37] <amigojapan> Gender neutral
[15:22:58] <amigojapan> Don't care if I am a man or a woman
[15:22:59] <KatrinValerie> There's actually a term for that, agender
[15:23:25] <amigojapan> Maybe gender apathetic
[15:23:55] <KatrinValerie> I personally think that you don't really need gender boxes at all, but they are useful within a gendered society
[15:24:25] <KatrinValerie> I mean, you would not need them in a world that doesn't care about sex/gender all that much

[16:03:29] <amigojapan> You may love spicy food, but don't give any to your kitty. Many spicy foods get their flavoring from capsaicin, which can give your poor cat a lot of stomach troubles, including vomiting. Your cat's eyes might get watery and he might have a runny nose from it too.

[16:23:23] <darkwitch> amigojapan, it only works for certain things like finnish salty liquorice, where the salt is ammonium chloride
[16:24:29] <amigojapan> darkwitch: they said it tastes like salt
[16:25:17] <darkwitch> you get a salty sensation but it's different
[16:25:25] <amigojapan> I see

[16:40:34] <darkwitch> you don't appear to have that "can't sleep" problem, however I struggle a bit with it sometimes
[16:40:59] <Sxem> you can use melatonin to make yourself get less sleep. just use it every night for a few months and then quit cold turkey
[16:41:38] <Sxem> you will sleep less bcs now you need the melatonin to sleep
[16:41:45] <amigojapan> I think I should ask tomako's doctor is she can get melatonin. Since she has strong insomnia. But she is already taking a strong somniac known as silence in Japan. Which is illegal in America

[16:46:33] <amigojapan> Ok let me check
[16:47:53] <amigojapan> darkwitch: It's flunitrazepam

[16:50:20] <darkwitch> very long half-life of 18–26 hours, so you end up feeling it all day
[16:50:38] <Sxem> i do melatonin once per week so i dont get addicted
[16:51:43] <darkwitch> zolpidem is more like 2-3 hours, so it only helps you fall asleep, then fades away

[17:08:34] <makiseKurisu> it will take a bit before i can read manga in jp
[17:08:37] <darkwitch> amigojapan, I think it's more useful if you're not completely out of whack with your sleep
[17:08:45] <amigojapan> Alright makiseKurisu 
[17:09:02] <darkwitch> it only makes you sleepy and does not make you sleep
[17:09:20] <amigojapan> darkwitch: not sure what you mean
[17:10:00] <tsukkin> some sleep aids work by shutting off the brain but melatonin works by releasing the same chemicals your brain would release in a natural sleep cycle 
[17:10:36] <tsukkin> it basically only helps if you are actively trying to sleep
[17:11:05] <darkwitch> yes, melatonin is more useful for when you can't sleep because you're out of sync and not sleepy at the right time
[17:11:25] <amigojapan> I see darkwitch 
[17:11:26] <darkwitch> it doesn't knock you out like the regular sleeping pills

[17:15:17] <amigojapan> tsukkin: probably not on Amazon Japan, but let me check
[17:15:24] <darkwitch> flunitrazepam is very different and lasts for way too long
[17:15:44] <tsukkin> melatonin is sold as homeopathic almost
[17:15:55] <amigojapan> darkwitch: maybe she can take both
[17:16:08] <darkwitch> I would not recommend that
[17:16:22] <tsukkin> sounds like a fun way to get cool nightmares
[17:16:26] <tsukkin> and maybe brain damage 
[17:16:39] <darkwitch> the best would be some kind of inhibitor for flunitrazepam, so it stops doing its thing after you wake up

[18:47:33] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I recommend you eat at a restaurant behind the sensouji temple in asakusa. That is my favourite. Except it is probably more oil than ramen. And the chashuu melts in your mouth

[19:02:17] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I find the phrase "he was a divisive character, loved by some and frustrating others" kind of BS
[19:02:21] <amigojapan> I liked him

[19:02:41] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: interesting, why's that?
[19:03:03] <amigojapan> Dunno. I found him to be a unique character
[19:03:04] <TsundereNoises> (to be fair, I did like The Doctor and Torres, just overall not a Voyager fan)
[19:03:10] <TsundereNoises> I feel like he got a lot of the worst writing
[19:03:14] <TsundereNoises> right up there with Janeway
[19:03:24] <TsundereNoises> they could have done a lot more with him
[19:03:40] <amigojapan> Janeway was super smart at the end
[19:03:53] <TsundereNoises> she had her moments, the problem was she was inconsistent
[19:04:01] <TsundereNoises> sometimes she was smart, sometimes she was an idiot
[19:04:08] <TsundereNoises> which was the writers' fault
[19:04:12] <amigojapan> True
[19:04:48] <amigojapan> My favourite will always be TNG, but I enjoyed voyager
[19:04:48] <TsundereNoises> I quite like the actress, blanking on her name right now, but I think she generally did the best anyone could with the scripts she had
[19:04:52] <TsundereNoises> my problem is the writing
[19:05:11] <amigojapan> 7 of 9?
[19:05:22] <TsundereNoises> no I meant Janeway's actress
[19:05:29] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[19:05:33] <TsundereNoises> I've always thought 7 of 9 was kind of overrated honestly
[19:05:49] <amigojapan> Ok
[19:05:50] <TsundereNoises> because everyone had a crush on her when they were impressionably preteens watching Voyager
[19:06:17] <Poeticode> holy shit it's friday

[19:25:07] <TsundereNoises> with how these get used, I wish dictionaries would be more careful about synonyms, there are so often nuance differences between words
[19:25:11] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: maybe I will
[19:25:22] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: the word that's been pissing me off the most lately is "singular"
[19:25:44] <MootPoot> Tsundere English
[19:25:51] <amigojapan> HMmm
[19:26:01] <amigojapan> Why TsundereNoises 
[19:26:15] <TsundereNoises> singular CAN technically just mean referring to one thing, as I'm sure someone will cite a dictionary saying
[19:26:37] <TsundereNoises> but it's primary meaning is about uniqueness or exceptionalism
[19:26:42] <TsundereNoises> this is singularly good ramen
[19:26:43] <TsundereNoises> etc
[19:26:44] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: because it can mean only and also to one thing? Or one time?
[19:27:13] <amigojapan> I see
[19:27:14] <TsundereNoises> but lately I've seen so much of people using it as a fancier version of "single" where "single" would actually be the better word to use

[19:28:10] <TsundereNoises> where people are using it like "utilize"
[19:28:16] <TsundereNoises> (another peeve word of mine)
[19:28:28] <TsundereNoises> not that people utilize utilize wrong, but just it's a bigger word = fancier thing
[19:28:33] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: but you can also day "the single best ramen"and it would be about exceptinalism
[19:28:35] <TsundereNoises> and it drives me nuts in cases where "use" would flow better
[19:28:54] <darkwitch> cheese ramen is the best ramen
[19:29:04] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I mean yes, but that has a slightly different nuance to me
[19:29:36] <amigojapan> darkwitch: cheese water*
[19:29:37] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: "singularly good ramen" may NOT actually be your all time #1, but it's unique
[19:30:07] <amigojapan> I see TsundereNoises 
[19:30:45] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: anyway, I feel like the whole point of having a lot of different but similar words is that they have different nuance and implications
[19:30:48] <darkwitch> amigojapan, yes it was cheese water but in the context of ramen: <S​xem> i like to melt a slice of cheese into my ramen to make cheese water
[19:31:08] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: and a lot of these bad dictionaries tend to emphasize the similarities rather than the differences (basically to make for easier reading I guess)
[19:31:20] <TsundereNoises> like that style of entry is best if you find a word you don't know and you want a rough idea what it means
[19:31:30] <TsundereNoises> but it's counterproductive in the other direction

[19:32:45] <TsundereNoises> HubertFarnsworth: yeah, it's a constant frustration of mine, it's not like there's no place for a dictionary with more concise but less detailed entries, but we've grown to treating them as the end-all-be-all authority
[19:33:17] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: surprisingly often wiktionary is kind of great, but sometimes it sucks, it's still very inconsistent like wikipedia used to be
[19:33:32] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: at the very least the concept of getting lots of word nerds arguing is productive I think

[19:34:18] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I like it for looking up etymology

[19:50:51] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu__: butternoodle was last seen in ##anime 9 hours and 4 minutes ago: <ButterNoodle> thats a nice bomb shelter
[19:50:57] <HubertFarnsworth> Hitchcock used his tv crew actually amigojapan because no studio agreed to make that movie
[19:50:59] <TsundereNoises> I realized I'd never seen the first Friday the 13th, so finally watched it this year
[19:51:02] <TsundereNoises> and wow, what a shit movie
[19:51:09] <TsundereNoises> especially compared to those others and how famous it is
[19:51:13] <confact> amigojapan: I saw all aliens in a row. They were amazing.
[19:51:21] <confact> I also saw Starwars early.
[19:51:48] <TsundereNoises> Hitchcock also made a ton of money on Pyscho, because since there was no faith in it and he ended up funding more of it himself, he got a MUCH bigger cut than usual
[19:51:53] <TsundereNoises> and then it was such a big hit
[19:51:59] <amigojapan> Me too, exact same experience confact 
[19:52:36] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: how about the birds?
[19:52:42] <TsundereNoises> but yeah, I watched a ton of 80's slasher movies this year, and Friday the 13th was definitely one of the worst, it's weird how famous it is
[19:52:46] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: would you like to hear my rant about awards shows
[19:52:48] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: I love The Birds
[19:52:52] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: sure
[19:53:02] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I preemptively agree
[19:53:06] <MootPoot> I hate them and they are a circlejerk of in-members
[19:53:07] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: he should have used falcons for birds
[19:53:09] <MootPoot> thats  it
[19:53:11] <MootPoot> end of rant
[19:53:36] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I hate that so many of the people who vote on best animated short, for example, don't actually watch the shorts
[19:53:40] <TsundereNoises> they just vote for the Pixar one

[19:54:04] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: also I hate that we give them so much power, but, like Twitter, as long as others keep giving them so much power they are kind of unavoidable
[19:54:20] <MootPoot> I pre-emptively hate all the entertainment awards shows
[19:54:24] <MootPoot> so I dont watch them
[19:54:37] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: that's why Pixar wins best animated short so often despite much better ones getting overlooked, lots of people have admitted to that because they don't take it as a serious category
[19:54:54] <TsundereNoises> I have never watched an awards show all the way through in my life
[19:54:59] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: MootPoot . It's as I always say. I don't go by ratings 
[19:55:04] <TsundereNoises> I'd get annoyed after more than 5 minutes
[19:55:10] <TsundereNoises> but I do check who wins so I can be mad about it
[19:55:17] <MootPoot> amigojapan: well its not that - ratings are different from awards
[19:55:27] <MootPoot> ratings are from people who actually play/watch it
[19:55:35] <amigojapan> MootPoot: awards are ratings
[19:55:37] <TsundereNoises> my problem is that awards have so much ability to sell movies
[19:55:37] <MootPoot> awards on the other hand
[19:55:39] <TsundereNoises> so the DO matter
[19:55:46] <TsundereNoises> winning an award has a huge financial impact
[19:55:56] <TsundereNoises> and helps that thing, things like that, that director make more things
[19:56:02] <TsundereNoises> so the matter, even though I hate that they matter
[19:56:21] <TsundereNoises> they*

[20:00:28] <amigojapan> I see
[20:00:29] <TsundereNoises> same with korean movies
[20:00:49] <TsundereNoises> french win more than they should, and often the best french movie of the year isn't ever nominated

[21:05:49] <Cryowolf> depends how bright you run it and whether or not you shift color on the pixels or whatnot. There's tricks to prolong it but eventually it will burn in yeah
[21:06:35] <Cryowolf> it's still the only hyper-realistic way of making it look like an actual window. Since each pixel is its own color and "glow" and that glow can match what it would be like IRL
[21:06:44] <Cryowolf> with al ight sensor

[21:31:11] <Bco1981> terrain interaction?
[21:32:25] <Cryowolf> if it snows a lot, the weight might break away a branch of a tree. There might be wind strong enough to fell the tree. Maybe there's a flood that changes the terrain cause you know water does that
[21:32:55] <Cryowolf> maybe I'm on another planet or a fantasy world and it's a mana storm that blows chunks away from cliffs
[21:33:15] <Bco1981> where would you get these videos ?
[21:33:22] <Cryowolf> whatever level of terrain interaction is possible
[21:34:10] <Cryowolf> it wouldn't be a video, it would be software running it. Or in case none of that works, I'll use unreal engine somehow

[22:40:55] <emmeka> at some point they did fansub but as a group gave up on it ages ago
[22:40:56] <TsundereNoises> Subsplease is just another ripper though
[22:41:08] * Satin brb in 14m
[22:41:19] <Jigsy> That's oddly specific.
[22:41:24] <emmeka> I'm just amazed at how bad Netflix is with anime
[22:42:22] <MootPoot> Satin: I'm going to screenshot ur nft
[22:42:40] <Satin> screenshot dn
[22:42:50] <MootPoot> how many btc is dn worth
[22:42:53] <emmeka> singlehandedly rewinding the clock 15 years, to an era when you had to wait for fansubs as a matter of necessity, censorship of anime was common, and it tooks upwards of a year after Japanese airdate before official releases could be obtained
[22:43:25] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: yes, but often fansubs were better than the official subs (even true last year despite what people say)
[22:43:32] <TsundereNoises> it's just on the HYPE shows, official subs got good enough
[22:43:36] <TsundereNoises> that was the problem
[22:43:45] <MootPoot> tbh I cant read shit but I've gotten to the point where either what I watch is simple enough , but 40% of the time I dont even need subs to know what's going on
[22:43:54] <MootPoot> especially in the simpler shows
[22:43:57] <emmeka> TsundereNoises more importantly than good enough, they got fast
[22:44:03] <TsundereNoises> low effort b-team subs from the big companies for the less hyped shows = worse
[22:44:06] <TsundereNoises> but only I cared
[22:44:11] <TsundereNoises> or it felt that way sometimes
[22:44:24] <emmeka> and really for all people like to complain about crunchy/funi sub quality, it's far superior to the median fansub was 15 years ago
[22:44:32] <emmeka> in terms of both accuracy and quality
[22:44:41] <Jigsy> I do not concur.
[22:44:52] <MootPoot> you salty cur!
[22:44:53] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I never watched the median fansub
[22:44:56] <TsundereNoises> I watched the best for each show
[22:44:59] *** Quits: darkwitch (~darkwitch@user/darkwitch) (Quit: Leaving)
[22:45:17] <TsundereNoises> also crunchy and funi are fucking terrible and low effort for things like, for example, idol shows
[22:45:19] <emmeka> you're right that modern fansubs tend to be far superior to anything official services offer, but this is only because the only groups that still fansub are those doing it for the sake of maximum quality
[22:45:45] <emmeka> Jigsy do you not remember just how bad some fansubs used to be back then.
[22:46:13] <Jigsy> Oh, I remember...
[22:46:15] <emmeka> translated by people who clearly had a very tenuous grasp on both Japanese and English, typeset in the most obnoxious ways possible
[22:46:15] <Jigsy> ...Hadena.
[22:46:53] <TsundereNoises> there have always been bad fansubs, but unless they were the only group, no one forced you to watch them
[22:47:06] <listenurs> subs on dubs
[22:47:31] <Satin> subway 
[22:47:39] <KatrinValerie> yuck
[22:47:40] <TsundereNoises> I think part of it is people subbing things they don't like
[22:47:44] <Jigsy> EAT FRESH.
[22:47:52] <KatrinValerie> Jigsy: that's a lie
[22:47:52] <TsundereNoises> as cliche as it is, I feel like a love of what you're working on helps
[22:48:03] <Satin> Jigsy: if i go there i get the spinach wraps
[22:48:05] <Satin> lmao
[22:48:11] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: what if you are anhedonic?
[22:48:29] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: then don't get into fansubbing and go work on yourself
[22:48:50] <Satin> so true
[22:48:53] <TsundereNoises> OR! sub an anime no one likes
[22:49:00] <TsundereNoises> then your experience will match everyone else
[22:49:05] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: I am working on myself every day
[22:49:05] <emmeka> fansubs for Conception
[22:49:13] <KatrinValerie> But the anhedonia doesn't go away
[22:49:22] <MootPoot> the worst anime I've ever watched
[22:49:30] <MootPoot> I remember it being like 1-2 seasons ago
[22:49:35] <Satin> well hopefully you don't sub
[22:49:44] <MootPoot> he's a  sub :P
[22:49:47] <Jigsy> Kono Aozora ni Yakusoku Wo is literally the worst anime I've ever seen.
[22:49:50] <KatrinValerie> Satin: I'd dub
[22:49:55] <Satin> MootPoot: she*
[22:50:02] <Satin> KatrinValerie: ew
[22:50:04] <Satin> subs > dub
[22:50:05] <KatrinValerie> Satin: I can voice the entire cast
[22:50:09] <MootPoot> what
[22:50:11] <Jigsy> Oh.
[22:50:16] <Jigsy> Did you hear the good news?
[22:50:16] <MootPoot> I thought we were talking about tsundere
[22:50:17] <emmeka> fun fact: Conception is currently the lowest rated series on MAL to have a full dub.

[22:50:53] <TsundereNoises> Jigsy: how did they cancel it, they didn't just release it all at once?
[22:50:53] <MootPoot> well , it was like
[22:50:55] <MootPoot> decent fanfic
[22:50:59] <river> There... was only 1 series anyway...
[22:51:01] <MootPoot> me and butter had the same opinion
[22:51:03] <Jigsy> No S2.
[22:51:07] <Jigsy> I didn't watch it.

[22:51:18] <MootPoot> in the ass
[22:51:20] <TsundereNoises> I mean, why would I watch it when the anime already exists?
[22:51:21] <MootPoot> anally
[22:51:25] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: bored
[22:51:28] <MootPoot> thats why
[22:51:38] <Jigsy> I don't even watch Japanese live action adaptations of anime.
[22:51:43] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: but I have a hundred anime I need to watch, a ton of live action shows and movies, and thousands of books to read
[22:51:45] <KatrinValerie> Jigsy: oi, I watched the full metal alchemist live action with a friend
[22:51:47] <MootPoot> its like when you're bored and then the reasearchers tie you into a chair with a button that shocks yourself
[22:51:52] <listenurs> berserk and h gata b kei are more enjoyable
[22:51:53] <TsundereNoises> why waste time on live action anime adaptations
[22:51:55] <KatrinValerie> and it wasn't absolutely terrible
[22:51:56] <MootPoot> you'll end up shocking yourself
[22:51:56] <KatrinValerie> like
[22:52:00] <KatrinValerie> it was bad, but not that bad
[22:52:00] <MootPoot> out of boredom
[22:52:05] <Jigsy> [19:22:00] <KatrinValerie> it was bad, but not that bad
[22:52:07] <Jigsy> You should leave. :<
[22:52:11] * Jigsy tearfully points at the door.
[22:52:16] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: yeah but you wanna save those for when you have the brain juice
[22:52:19] <MootPoot> to enjoy them
[22:52:27] <MootPoot> not when you want brainded trash to watch
[22:52:33] <Jigsy> It's like... remakes of movies.
[22:52:35] <listenurs> its kinda like ghost in the shell its not bad rite
[22:52:43] <Satin> "bad but not that bad"
[22:52:43] <KatrinValerie> Jigsy: it just failed to get as deep as brotherhood
[22:52:53] <Jigsy> Why the fuck would you watch the new version of say... Point Break?
[22:52:56] <Jigsy> Instead of the original.
[22:53:03] <emmeka> Jigsy I actually liked the live action version of Battle Angel Alita
[22:53:17] <Jigsy> One day we'll reach the point of remakes of remakes.
[22:53:22] <Jigsy> Yeah, wrap your head around that.
[22:53:25] <KatrinValerie> I want a fight club anime
[22:53:26] <emmeka> I went into it expecting to hate it, but watched it because hey, when else is there anything anime-esque at my local theatre
[22:53:35] <KatrinValerie> I have not seen the live action version yet and I want to see the anime first
[22:53:36] <emmeka> and it turned out to be good and pretty faithful
[22:53:40] <Satin> KatrinValerie: ...
[22:53:50] <Satin> Watch the movie.
[22:53:56] <listenurs> well that movie was really good
[22:54:00] <MootPoot> ok NFT jokes aside for making money and  dumb cosmetics
[22:54:07] <MootPoot> are there any legit applications for it?
[22:54:13] <MootPoot> encryption?
[22:54:17] <KatrinValerie> non fungible tokens?
[22:54:19] <MootPoot> signing keys etc
[22:54:21] <listenurs> we watch that one on syncplay on freenode it was probs the best one
[22:54:23] <MootPoot> KatrinValerie: yes
[22:54:25] <TsundereNoises> Jigsy: The Thing
[22:54:26] <Satin> of course, but it's all not practically applied yet 
[22:54:33] <Satin> of course there's some application which it's probably relevant to
[22:54:35] <Satin> just like crypto
[22:54:45] <KatrinValerie> I have no idea, but aren't they like a smart contract bs thing from etherum?
[22:54:45] <listenurs> not anime remake the movie
[22:54:48] <Satin> but all it's used for is jacking up the speculative investment bullshit
[22:54:48] <emmeka> I would go so far as to say that the hollywood version of Alita surpassed the old OVAs
[22:55:01] <emmeka> the source material was better, but, that's to be expected
[22:55:06] <KatrinValerie> And if the issuer fucks up their code the whole thing might be stolen
[22:55:21] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: that kind of NFT?
[22:55:39] <MootPoot> idk, are they kinds of NFTs?
[22:55:41] <KatrinValerie> or the whole unique identifier on a ledger as proof of ownership?
[22:55:50] <MootPoot> all I know is the screenshot ur nft memes
[22:55:58] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: idk, most of the time I see monkey faces when people talk about nfts
[22:56:12] <KatrinValerie> cryptographically signed images are the rage
[22:56:21] <MootPoot> I feel like theres probably like SOME point to it 
[22:56:26] <MootPoot> maybe like next-level QR codes?
[22:56:45] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: it's basically the same thing as with the rampant growth of bitcoin forks back in the day as far as I understand it
[22:56:50] <TsundereNoises> !later tell Bco1981 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsVl3yHbQ3U
[22:56:56] <Satin> cryptocurrency sucks
[22:57:07] <KatrinValerie> Wrong
[22:57:11] <KatrinValerie> Currency sucks
[22:57:17] <Urchin[emacs]> NFT is not a proof of ownership
[22:57:17] <KatrinValerie> Capitalism was a mistake
[22:57:20] <Satin> cryptocurrency specifically sucks more
[22:57:21] <Urchin[emacs]> it's an outright scam
[22:57:39] <KatrinValerie> Urchin[emacs]: from what I have read that's a good summaration
[22:57:51] <MootPoot> my only problem with crypto is the wasted compute
[22:57:58] <KatrinValerie> error brain segfault error
[22:57:59] <MootPoot> I'd be okay with state managed crypto as currency
[22:58:03] <Satin> MootPoot: 
[22:58:04] <MootPoot> instead of printing paper

[22:58:05] <ImoutoBot> [image/png] 26kB
[22:58:08] <MootPoot> like we do now
[22:58:10] <Satin> my two cents
[22:58:17] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: there's some proof of steak block chains out there
[22:58:19] <MootPoot> EuroCoin when
[22:58:22] <listenurs> when understanding bitcoin its good to walk through the actual ledger checksum
[22:58:23] <MootPoot> I want steak
[22:58:24] <KatrinValerie> but think about all the cattle
[22:58:55] <emmeka> MootPoot so you want a currency medium that's inherently deflationary?
[22:59:01] <MootPoot> would it be possible to have it executed in a way which uses less power to operate then the current banking system?
[22:59:02] <emmeka> sounds like a good way to break everything
[22:59:11] <emmeka> answer: no.
[22:59:12] <MootPoot> deflationary?
[22:59:13] <KatrinValerie> Satin: it says your real name on there I think
[23:00:14] <emmeka> MootPoot a general long term tendency for the value of money to increase in value
[23:00:24] <emmeka> this is bad, when it comes to an economy.
[23:00:35] <MootPoot> what does this have to do with crypto
[23:01:00] <KatrinValerie> oh btc dipped
[23:01:13] <emmeka> crypto supply increases at a forever decreasing rate.
[23:01:51] <MootPoot> all I said was that I'd be okay if we replaced our current system with crypto that is state sponsored - and the state handles all the issuing of new tokens/coins
[23:01:53] <TsundereNoises> demand for currency will go up over time unless we have something like a major population dieoff
[23:01:55] <MootPoot> like they do already
[23:01:57] <Satin> KatrinValerie: no, i just added that while bored a long time ago
[23:02:07] <KatrinValerie> from what I hear current economists say that having a slight inflation is the best
[23:02:15] <MootPoot> nothing changes aside from the method of execution 
[23:02:25] <KatrinValerie> Are I having a stroke or why do i word like that?
[23:02:32] <emmeka> MootPoot the rate at which new crypto can be minted decreases forever
[23:02:46] <Satin> emmeka: that depends entirely on the currency
[23:02:46] <TsundereNoises> oh, like the government invents new crypto currencies to cause inflation?
[23:02:47] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: except for dodge
[23:02:47] <emmeka> ie, the rate at which the money supply can grow slows, eventually stopping.
[23:02:49] <KatrinValerie> doge
[23:02:49] <Satin> cryptocurrency*
[23:02:52] <KatrinValerie> doge
[23:02:56] <MootPoot> depends on how its setup
[23:02:57] <KatrinValerie> infinite supply
[23:03:02] <MootPoot> ^
[23:03:10] <Satin> yeah, emmeka is using bitcoin as an example of all crypto, which is, not true especially with newer alt coins
[23:03:13] <Satin> and DeFi and so on
[23:03:28] <emmeka> no, it doesn't.
[23:03:48] <emmeka> dogecoin has no hard cap, but still succumbs to the same problem of decreasing rate of production in fixed time
[23:03:50] <listenurs> didnt that guy who owns more than tesla just bought billions at 48k
[23:04:09] <listenurs> billions of dollars worth
[23:04:15] <MootPoot> but the core point is "I'd like to have cash-like anonymity and use while not using cash anymore, and not having accounts tied to indavidual names" but the issuing of that cash is just state controlled
[23:04:17] <emmeka> it's an inherent flaw of the entire mechanism
[23:04:25] <MootPoot> emmeka: you know there is a easy workaround to this right
[23:04:49] <emmeka> no.
[23:05:04] <MootPoot> just issue a new iteration which as the same IRL value as the old one whenever its too much of a pain to compute new ones
[23:05:11] <listenurs> install bitcoin on popos
[23:05:17] <Satin> also etherium 2.0 doesn't mint the same way
[23:05:18] <emmeka> if your solution is "just make another crypto again!" like we're the Weimar republic or something, then yes, this is possible. It's a bad idea.
[23:05:20] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: but it's more profitable for big companies (and therefore the government) to push you away from cash
[23:05:43] <MootPoot> If I say I have 10 euro on my card , it might b e = 3 eurocoin 2015 , 6 eurocoin 2020, and 1 eurocoin 2021 versions
[23:05:46] <TsundereNoises> also we love surveillance states these days
[23:05:50] <MootPoot> except IRL they all have the same value
[23:05:54] <TsundereNoises> and that works better when you can track everything
[23:06:00] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: so you are saying long term doge is going to be deflationary too?
[23:06:05] <Satin> eth 2.0 has staking etc
[23:06:27] <emmeka> KatrinValerie I mean at present dogecoin is not a currency, it's an asset for dorks to speculate on
[23:06:39] <MootPoot> emmeka:  why is that a bad idea - every state can just crank out whatever amount of state money they want
[23:06:46] <MootPoot> nothing really changes
[23:06:59] <emmeka> MootPoot because this has the inverse effect.
[23:07:03] <Satin> emmeka: that's every cryptocurrency which is one of my central problems with it
[23:07:05] <MootPoot> how so?
[23:07:10] <Satin> the actual underlying technology is oversold

[23:07:38] <KatrinValerie> BITCONNECT!
[23:07:44] <MootPoot> YEET
[23:07:49] <KatrinValerie> idk how people fall for that shit
[23:08:07] <KatrinValerie> People should use bitcoin for it's original purpose
[23:08:14] <Satin> nope
[23:08:15] <KatrinValerie> to buy and sell shit without the government interfering
[23:08:15] <emmeka> if you suddenly switch from money being hard/expensive to generate, to it being easy/cheap to generate, and also force a mass transaction, you get inflation
[23:08:25] <Satin> it's not very good at doing what its alleged original purpose was
[23:08:32] <Satin> there's lots of scale issues that need to be resolved lol
[23:08:34] <KatrinValerie> Satin: but how are we gonna buy the illegal drugs?
[23:08:35] <MootPoot> its already easy/cheap to generate though 
[23:08:36] <MootPoot> like
[23:08:36] <emmeka> MootPoot this is why just moving decimal points on currency doesn't fix inflationary problems
[23:08:42] <Satin> KatrinValerie: .............
[23:09:03] <MootPoot> we already have fiat currency
[23:09:07] <KatrinValerie> Satin: Estrogen could be illegal as a med tomorrow
[23:09:07] <Satin> emmeka: transaction or transisition?
[23:09:15] <emmeka> transaction
[23:09:28] <Satin> what kind of "mass transaction" would there be?
[23:09:44] <emmeka> in MootPoot's model, the exchange of the old currency for the new
[23:09:51] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: nobody in their right mind drives a fiat
[23:09:55] <Satin> oh my b, didn't catch that
[23:09:57] <emmeka> you'd force the move of all hard cash in the entire economy
[23:09:57] <MootPoot> KatrinValerie: true
[23:10:02] <Satin> emmeka: yeah that's dumb
[23:10:09] <MootPoot> emmeka: well, I'd wait till it dies anyway
[23:10:15] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: there actually is a tuning brand as well
[23:10:20] <MootPoot> didnt a few countries already do that
[23:10:21] <KatrinValerie> for the fiat 500
[23:10:24] <MootPoot> in scandanavia
[23:10:29] <emmeka> MootPoot not to mention, there's various other problems. The blockchain means that *every single* transaction is public
[23:10:31] <MootPoot> they changed it all to digital

[23:11:53] <Satin> and smaller countries can easily use that same tech and go cashless entirely
[23:11:55] <TsundereNoises> it's about exactly the opposite
[23:12:00] <Satin> TsundereNoises: yeah
[23:12:11] <TsundereNoises> people feel "safer" because they are at least a bit INconveineced, so they feel like something is being done
[23:12:14] <MootPoot> >By then, by March 24, 2023 to be precise, in Sweden, cash will no longer be accepted as a means of payment. In general, cash is already a no-go in Sweden.
[23:12:16] <MootPoot> like
[23:12:18] <MootPoot> its already here
[23:12:20] <emmeka> sound sterrible.
[23:12:28] <MootPoot> emmeka is making it out to be some kind of huge deal
[23:12:31] <emmeka> it is.
[23:12:31] <Satin> MootPoot: sounds unnecessary
[23:12:36] <TsundereNoises> yeah I'm with emmeka on this
[23:12:39] <emmeka> and will probably never happen here
[23:12:44] <TsundereNoises> "on this" <- first time for everything
[23:12:51] <listenurs> theres no ledger withcash
[23:12:56] <Satin> what's the point of going entirely cashless
[23:12:57] <emmeka> cash is still a huge part of our economy and whole segments of the population would be fucked without it
[23:13:00] <listenurs> with a ledger comes security
[23:13:01] <Satin> it's not oging to save the environment
[23:13:09] <emmeka> how else am I supposed to buy something in the middle of a field miles from town
[23:13:10] <Satin> what does it accomplish
[23:13:13] <emmeka> bah
[23:13:20] <Satin> what's the rush
[23:13:25] <MootPoot> why are you in the middle of a field?
[23:13:28] <MootPoot> buying stuff
[23:13:32] <MootPoot> are you a drug dealer?
[23:13:33] <emmeka> listenurs nobody should see my books but me.
[23:13:35] <TsundereNoises> yeah, cash is much more reliable for those of us who've bought a car in a parking lot of a rite-aid, for example
[23:13:39] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: you are asking the right questions
[23:13:51] <emmeka> MootPoot my drug of choice is rabbits and produce
[23:13:53] <TsundereNoises> plenty of non-criminals do it
[23:14:09] <KatrinValerie> Cash makes buying a car easier for sure
[23:14:14] <TsundereNoises> !quote 223
[23:14:15] <ImoutoBot> TsundereNoises: (223 / 274) <T​sundereNoises> don't do drugs, have pointless debates with IRC nerdfolk instead!
[23:14:18] <KatrinValerie> You can often grab a discount if you pay cash
[23:14:26] <Satin> i don't think cryptocurrency development is focused much on what the cryptoevangelists were originally preaching about anyways
[23:14:32] <emmeka> I remember someone telling me that in France cash is banned for transactions above 500€
[23:14:32] <KatrinValerie> according to some random youtube video and probably limited to the usa
[23:14:33] <TsundereNoises> KatrinValerie: you can also buy from someone who isn't a car dealership
[23:14:35] <emmeka> and thinking, wtf
[23:14:35] <Satin> more about how to turn it into a financially lucrative device
[23:14:41] <KatrinValerie> TsundereNoises: yeah that too
[23:14:43] <listenurs> the seller wont see your name like on debit
[23:14:50] <KatrinValerie> I wouldn't want to buy a dealership car anyways
[23:14:58] <KatrinValerie> I am insane and want a project car instead
[23:15:04] <TsundereNoises> cheaper
[23:15:11] * emmeka still writes cheques, tbh
[23:15:26] <MootPoot> boomer
[23:15:37] <emmeka> MootPoot also, something crazy. did you know interac e-transfer doesn't exist in the US
[23:15:39] <emmeka> like, what
[23:15:39] <KatrinValerie> But I wonder what kind of project car it should be
[23:15:45] <MootPoot> oh yeah, I heard about that
[23:15:46] <TsundereNoises> the whole point of cash is you can buy things from people who are not stores
[23:15:52] <KatrinValerie> should work on creating a sutainable income first
[23:15:54] <KatrinValerie> lol
[23:15:57] <MootPoot> thats why they have so many cash transfer apps there
[23:15:57] <TsundereNoises> also stores who don't want to pay mastercard and visa a cut every time
[23:16:06] <emmeka> I'm kind of amazed by it, but yeah, it explains all the garbage cash apps
[23:16:34] <TsundereNoises> and how are these cash apps funded?
[23:17:35] <TsundereNoises> we constantly act like giving an additional cut to some company somewhere is the definition of Progress
[23:17:46] <TsundereNoises> see also: school lunch programs in the US
[23:17:47] <emmeka> TsundereNoises in Canada, you can send money to anyone over interac by email. It's the usual way to do transactions between individuals, besides cash.
[23:18:07] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: and the government funds the service?
[23:18:09] <TsundereNoises> that's nice
[23:18:18] <MootPoot> There is a transaction fee afaik
[23:18:21] <MootPoot> not much
[23:18:22] <TsundereNoises> 10,000% chance the US government will outsource to a company that takes 8%
[23:18:36] <emmeka> MootPoot nah, it just counts as an interac transaction
[23:19:01] <emmeka> so assuming your bank account includes at least some free transactions a month, it's covered.

[23:19:56] <emmeka> it's universal, as universal as debit cards

[23:27:35] <Jigsy> At first you had my curiosity, but now you have my erection.
[23:27:40] <Satin> north americans for various reasons, not so much, and are hugely skeptical of the state
[23:27:53] <ButterNoodle> as if he didnt already have it to begin with
[23:28:03] <TsundereNoises> I mean do most british people think their state is all that great?
[23:28:11] <TsundereNoises> or do they just not care enough to do anything about it politically
[23:28:12] <TsundereNoises> jigsy?
[23:28:14] <ButterNoodle> Satin: the state? that comedy show was shit
[23:28:31] <Jigsy> The UK can rot for all I care.
[23:28:41] <ButterNoodle> HERE HERE
[23:28:42] <Satin> the UK is funny
[23:28:44] <emmeka> Jigsy you're getting your wish, fortunately
[23:28:50] <TsundereNoises> and I mean, it's no different than us, there are no good options and money buys elections with enough people that it's basically impossible to get anyone good in office, you can only ever pick the lesser of 2 evils
[23:29:03] <TsundereNoises> if anything you'd think the U.K. would have an easier time fixing this shit than us, and yet…
[23:29:09] <Jigsy> I hope one day I'm lucky enough to escape the UK...
[23:29:15] <Jigsy> ...for someone to ask me "Would you ever go back there?"
[23:29:26] <Jigsy> ...so I can respond with "That's like asking someone who had a tumor removed if they want it put back in."
[23:29:34] <TsundereNoises> Jigsy: I mean, do you have a lot of faith in your government and trust them to track your every move? is that a choice you're making?
[23:29:35] <ButterNoodle> people in the UK want to be America.. but not America.. like if they could just sail a bit further West around America.. to New America?
[23:29:39] <ButterNoodle> I'd hitch a ride
[23:29:39] <emmeka> TsundereNoises the UK has a lot of extremely reactionary things that even we don't have
[23:29:59] <Jigsy> I don't trust the gov't.
[23:30:04] <Jigsy> Certainly don't trust the police, either.
[23:30:07] <Jigsy> They're both corrupt.
[23:30:12] <emmeka> TsundereNoises example, did you know they don't have property tax. In the UK there's a "council tax" that is levied against tenants, not landlords.
[23:30:16] <listenurs> you are cancer free
[23:30:22] <TsundereNoises> Jigsy: my point
[23:30:22] <MootPoot> can I get NFT arch
[23:30:29] <Jigsy> Uh, council tax is propert tax.
[23:30:32] <Jigsy> property*
[23:30:32] <ButterNoodle> is kind like when ur working on a computer, car, hooker.. and u fuck it up to the point where u gotta throw it away and buy a new one...
[23:30:34] <listenurs> theres a recovery though
[23:30:41] <emmeka> Jigsy no, it isn't.
[23:30:46] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: yeah, also their libel laws are horrific
[23:30:46] <Jigsy> Yeah, it is.
[23:30:52] <Jigsy> They tried taxing individual tenants.
[23:30:54] <Jigsy> I didn't go well.
[23:30:55] <emmeka> Jigsy property tax in North America is levelled against property owners exclusively.
[23:30:56] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: but I meant the political funding paradigm

[23:31:20] <MootPoot> can we talk about the penis tax?
[23:31:20] <TsundereNoises> hypothetically the UK should have more political power to change things than we do here in the US, but we can see it's not amount ing to much
[23:31:31] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: I vote to cock block
[23:31:39] <Jigsy> The British public are spineless.
[23:31:53] <Satin> The UK is a bad example of what i was referencing anyways
[23:31:57] <Jigsy> Basically all the corruption that's happening at the moment...
[23:32:02] <Jigsy> ...the public's response is:
[23:32:03] <ButterNoodle> Jigsy: yea yall laid down and let em take ur guns and bum u with sharp knives
[23:32:08] <Satin> more like France, Sweden, Norway etc
[23:32:09] <TsundereNoises> Satin: it's an example that exactly fits my point though
[23:32:11] <Jigsy> "AT LEASt wE CAN VOte THem OuT DURiNG THE neXt eleCTioN."
[23:32:13] <MootPoot> I feel like the people in the west dont know how good they've got it 
[23:32:16] <MootPoot> relatively speaking
[23:32:19] <TsundereNoises> Satin: their political funding is more sensible, 3rd parties are viable
[23:32:20] <ButterNoodle> Jigsy: voting matters
[23:32:22] <TsundereNoises> and still, look at their government
[23:32:23] <MootPoot> that includes Jigsy

[23:32:29] <MootPoot> memin about the UK govt
[23:32:35] <Jigsy> Any other country on the planet (aside from the U.S.) would be in a state of civil war at this juncture.
[23:32:37] <ButterNoodle> I agree MootPoot.. 
[23:32:38] <Bco1981> TsundereNoises: how could she record this, and speaking so loud in public...
[23:32:45] <Satin> TsundereNoises: the UK is the worst out of the worst for examples tho
[23:32:57] <emmeka> Jigsy your council tax is levied against tenants and homeowners alike, but *not* against landlords, and is not levied against owners of non-residential property.
[23:32:57] <Satin> except for many italy and greece or something
[23:32:59] <Jigsy> At least we're not Australia, though...
[23:33:03] <Jigsy> ...so we've got that going for us.
[23:33:09] <ButterNoodle> merica may be a festering shit pool, but at least we aren't them
[23:33:19] <TsundereNoises> Satin: yeah but I'm trying to establish that populations don't just magically fix themselves
[23:33:28] <TsundereNoises> where everything is going right doesn't prove anything
[23:33:28] <MootPoot> HOWEVER - that dosen't mean that you need to stop trying to improve what you can - some people use that "the west is so good" as a excuse for not trying to improve things
[23:33:30] <Satin> oh yeah for sure
[23:33:36] <emmeka> Jigsy here, it is *always* levied against the property *owner*. That means homeowners and landlords and owners of any real estate of any kind, but *not* tenants.
[23:33:36] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: whataboutism is always frustrating
[23:33:37] <ButterNoodle> yea at lease we arent Australia.. although I do like the 16 piece koala bucket
[23:33:53] <TsundereNoises> we are all lucky we're not living in somalia, but that's no reason to be content
[23:33:53] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: yea thats kinda fucked
[23:33:56] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: whatabout deez nu~
[23:33:58] <emmeka> it is pretty fucked.
[23:34:10] <Jigsy> Fun fact: A lot of landlords...
[23:34:12] <emmeka> their entire tax system gives landlords a free ride
[23:34:13] <Jigsy> ...are in fact, politicians.
[23:34:14] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: we'd have to be real small to like in salmonella
[23:34:29] <Jigsy> Or the banking sector.
[23:34:30] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: we'd have to be real small to live in salmonella
[23:34:37] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: at least we don't have drop bears here

[23:39:54] <MootPoot> :(
[23:39:57] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] but there are at least 2 provinces here where the abolition of feudal rule resulted in full land transfers to the tenants

[23:40:20] <MootPoot> oh, nvm they dropped it again
[23:40:38] <Urchin[emacs]> btw, the major nobles got decapitated, because they attempted to rebel against the emperor

[23:44:12] <emmeka> Urchin[emacs] in the tiny province of PEI, all land used to be owned by absentee landlords from England (noted scum), but the tenants there revolted during the negotiations for the confederation of Canada (which actually took place on PEI, in Charlottetown) and ultimately secured victory

[23:49:19] <TsundereNoises> yes, Maine is lovely
[23:49:22] <Fenderbassist> Satin: ah Razzleberry cool :)
[23:49:29] <TsundereNoises> but what if it were MOAR NORTH
[23:49:30] <Satin> yeah hehe
[23:49:32] <emmeka> TsundereNoises but I guess PEI is uniquely weird, what with the singing sands and the bright red mud
[23:50:02] <emmeka> the soil of PEI is actually vibrantly red, especially when it rains.
[23:50:13] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I've never been there but my parents went on their honeymoon
[23:50:16] <emmeka> and the beaches there "sing", make weird acoustic sounds when you walk on them
[23:50:33] <emmeka> kind of a magical place. that is best known for... potatoes.

[23:51:38] <TsundereNoises> if you can't grow potatoes there, can you really say a place is magical?
[23:51:41] <TsundereNoises> see also: Ireland
[23:51:49] <Satin> idaho ain't magical
[23:51:59] <emmeka> Idaho seems pretty magical
[23:52:04] <emmeka> it has mountains, potatoes
[23:52:08] <Satin> pfft
[23:52:09] <emmeka> what more do you need
[23:52:17] <TsundereNoises> parts of Idaho are pretty
[23:52:30] <TsundereNoises> same with Wyoming
[23:52:44] <emmeka> TsundereNoises did you know there's an Anne of Green Gables anime
[23:52:47] <emmeka> PEI: the anime
[23:52:52] <emmeka> a thing that exists.
[23:52:53] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: yes I did actually
[23:52:56] <TsundereNoises> I think amigo really likes it?
[23:53:16] <Satin> this is magical

[23:54:11] <KatrinValerie> Satin: did they enchant you yet?
[23:54:18] <Satin> i enchanted them
[23:54:20] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: especially because Polka has such a recognizable voice, I'm surprised no one noticed
[23:54:39] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I love Santa Fe, I think I've said that before
[23:54:52] <Satin> I've been there downtown but haven't checked it out too much
[23:54:53] <emmeka> Satin yes, a barren desert wasteland built on parasitism of the rivers, destined to die as the climate changes
[23:55:10] <Satin> it's not "a barren desert wasteland"
[23:55:15] <Satin> very incorrect
[23:55:18] <TsundereNoises> that's Arizona
[23:55:20] <Satin> yeah
[23:55:20] <Bco1981> TsundereNoises: exactly
[23:55:22] *** Joins: Itaru (~DaSH@ro2.flokinet.is)
[23:55:29] <Fenderbassist> I love it here in Arizona
[23:55:34] <Fenderbassist> it's 65 F currently
[23:55:40] <Satin> paratism of the rivers, well, yeah, how else do major cities exist
[23:55:55] <Satin> it's just that in this case, the Rio Grande is in deeper trouble than elsewhere
[23:55:56] <Fenderbassist> doors open, fresh air
[23:56:28] <emmeka> Satin in sensible places, there is water in the ground everywhere, so.
[23:56:38] <Satin> "sensible places"
[23:56:59] <Satin> major US cities including my hometown, Kansas City, is built alongside the Missouri river and so on
[23:57:02] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: You know the native people parasitized the rivers there too, one of the largest irrigation canal systems: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohokam

[23:57:29] <emmeka> I remember going out west and learning that nobody has a well so either you're on town water (invariably coming from either fossil aquifers, rivers or aqueducts from rivers), you just have to haul in water by the tank to your house.
[23:57:31] <Satin> and it's not like the new mexico/colorado/texas/mexico had issues in the past with the rio grande 
[23:57:32] <TsundereNoises> more in arizona
[23:57:33] <TsundereNoises> but still
[23:57:52] <Satin> it's relatively recent
[23:57:55] <emmeka> Satin that it is built on the river does not mean it gets its drinking water from the river.
[23:58:13] <emmeka> in non-arid climates, you can just puncture the aquifer anywhere, and it's k
[23:58:24] <TsundereNoises> it is nice living where it rains regularly
[23:58:42] <Satin> california has a harder time with water than us
[23:59:03] <MootPoot> why is gaslighting called gaslighting
[23:59:04] <MootPoot> I dont get it
[23:59:22] <ButterNoodle> asslighting
[23:59:23] <Satin> is there a difference between "semi arid" and "arid"
[23:59:35] <Satin> arizona is more like the deset most people are imagining

[23:59:44] <Jigsy> If history has shown anything it's that prohibition always works.
