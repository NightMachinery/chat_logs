[01:59:36] <xheimlich> so I used to superficially know a lot of languages as an amateur/hobby programmer but professionally progressed from stata to matlab to python. now I write Python code all week. I'm getting blind language-wise. I need to learn something new to keep my brain from fossilizing.
[02:01:02] <xheimlich> now, I used to know *some* Haskell back in the day but that's really ocmplicated to learn up to the point of doing something useful. I wrote a monad tutorial once, haha,
[02:01:21] <xheimlich> Anyway, the one language I used to some significant extent in the last few years was Hy.
[02:01:38] <xheimlich> Hy is a lisp-type language that compiles to the Python AST.

[03:59:43] <sobel> xheimlich: re: brain fozzilization, i was about to consider careers outside of code when i threw Spring to the curb and went real hard on SQL for a few years
[04:00:38] <sobel> xheimlich: clojure was a refreshing re-entry to java/jvm programming. now i use vert.x and clojure almost exclusively and i'm VERY happy with them.

[14:51:03] <Para> Hmm, interesting.
[14:51:23] <Para> Seems 1.11 has quite a few class serialization related issues which are being uncovered slowly.
[14:51:49] <Para> Mainly, some core class SerialVersionIDs updated across versions stealthily and they're now breaking things subtly here and there.
[14:52:32] <Para> I don't know if anything good has come from JVM's class serialization. It's slow, byte-heavy, requires exact runtime matches and seems to be full of exploits.
