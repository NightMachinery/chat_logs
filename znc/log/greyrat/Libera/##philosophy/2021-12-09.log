[00:17:25] <biys> audrey: jp points to nietzsche at the industrializatuon/urbanization time and suggests ubermensch with a new value structure not simply "god".   i wouldn't say jp is christian.  i would say he's simply looking at the underpinning.  "we can't throw the baby out with the bath water".  this message gets lost even with the cathy newman.  he's not opposed to change but "you better damn well make sure you want
[00:17:31] <biys>  it".
[00:18:02] <biys> we also don't know what other changes will happen as a result
[00:18:21] <biys> there could be xatastrophic results from reactionary change
[00:19:24] <biys> it's like the argument that the vaccine is dysgenic.  we are only worsening our ability to compete aginst virus naturally.
[00:19:58] <biys> the removal of some age old structure could have unintended consequences
[00:28:45] <audrey> Is this related to the notion of «progress trap»?
[00:29:05] <audrey> It sounds like you are describing, in effect, a moral version of a technological progress trap.
[00:29:28] <biys> i think it nore-so would be associated with the idea of natural organic change vs...  manipulated?
[00:29:33] <audrey> But like, what is JP proposing, exactly? To pretend to be Christians?
[00:30:04] <audrey> This was one of my frustrations with him, he seems to skate around the question of what specifically it would look like to accept this Judeo-Christian worldview when it has been hollowed out simply by the knowledge that it is false.
[00:30:11] <biys> where it seems he believes that the changes he sees taking place are inorganic
[00:30:18] <audrey> (Or more accurately, that all its supernatural underpinnings are false.)
[00:31:40] <biys> i think he views the bible as a series of tails with psychological significance.  it's the stories and the archetypal characters and situations.
[00:32:11] <biys> gleem from them some kind of idea of why or how
[00:32:39] <biys> and how all that is so intertwined with the world around us.
[00:32:57] <audrey> If this is just an assertion about Biblical myths being historically important to the creation of the Western world/Christendom, etc., then sure, that seems hardly controversial
[00:33:15] <audrey> But it seems like JP is trying to argue for more normative claims beyond that.
[00:33:24] <biys> like?
[00:33:37] <audrey> As in, «we should continue to cling to the Biblical myths», or similar.
[00:33:47] <audrey> Which is a normative/prescriptive claim as opposed to a descriptive, historical one.
[00:34:01] <audrey> JP seems to think there´s not much of a gap there, but I´m not convinced.
[00:34:39] <audrey> What would the more generalizable claim be? «A society that loses faith in its founding myths will collapse»?
[00:35:52] <biys> i'd have to talk about jfg's ideas regarding a revolutionary phenotype.
[00:36:18] <biys> when you start tinkering with sonething that has a lot of moving parts.
[00:36:33] <biys> you just don't know.
[00:37:10] <biys> not to mention what impacts it will also have in the distant future
[00:37:26] <biys> once our lens of the world has been changed or adjusted
[00:37:39] <biys> that is my perception of jp anyways

[00:51:32] <biys> my value structure is as such NOT because of my indoctrination into the aociety!
[00:51:44] <biys> it's laughable
[00:52:57] <audrey> Well, you have to be careful with that line of argument - cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy
[00:52:57] <ro-bot-o> [url] Genetic fallacy - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[00:53:53] <audrey> The only real point of contention I have, other than the tendency toward the genetic fallacy, is that - well, what exactly so great about Christendom?
[00:54:09] <biys> it's like taking some lumber and widdling it down to skis and taking those skis to the top of a mountain and riding down in exactly the same manner as a skier normally would.  upon arrival at the bottom someone says "nice skiing!" and you respond with "it isn't skiing, it's new!  i call it NOT-skiing"
[00:54:17] <biys> it has every feature of being skiing
[00:54:21] <biys> but you wanna rename it?
[00:54:40] <audrey> Perhaps «we» (in the loose sense of «Christendom», the «West» that JP et al. like to use) actually are the bad guys. There´s no good way a priori to determine this is not the case.
[00:55:05] <biys> paul treanor talks about this the best i think
[00:55:09] <biys> with regards to the idea of "human rights"
[00:55:16] <biys> and how the west thinks it's their JOB to "liberate" teh world
[00:55:20] <biys> and promote human rights
[00:55:27] <audrey> People tend to naturally assume that whatever system of government, society, etc. that they are born into and familiar with, is the natural one.
[00:55:34] <biys> regardless if the idea is being promoted on people who are unaware their "rights" are b eing violated
[00:55:57] <biys> A Serbian or Iraqi child who is shot to enforce human rights, suffers just as much pain, as an American or British child. Yet the US and British governments do not kill or injure their own citizens, to protect their human rights. That fate is reserved for Eastern Europeans, Arabs, Africans, and Asians. The western human rights lobby claims, that it is wrong to deny people human rights. They claim opposit
[00:56:03] <biys> ion to human rights is based on 'ethical relativism', and that their own 'moral universalism' is superior. Yet they would not bomb their own cities like they bombed Belgrade or Falluja or remote Afghan villages. Clearly, the 'moral universalism' of the human rights lobby is itself relative: it is turned on and off to conform to geopolitical interests. It was never much more than a propaganda slogan anywa
[00:56:09] <biys> y.
[00:56:22] <audrey> (Spoiler: I think everyone - West and East and everyone in between - are the bad guys.)
[00:56:31] <biys> i know that you do
[00:56:39] <biys> i just think peopel are inherently problematic
[00:57:00] <audrey> To use a profane Russian expression, «it´s all the toad fucking the viper».
[00:57:05] <audrey> (Pot calling the kettle black, etc.)
[00:57:28] <biys> so moral nihilism in a sense
[00:58:07] <biys> where nothing is really good or bad it all just is.  and relative
[00:58:31] <biys> i can see, frmo each lens, how it's interpreted by whatever is receiving stimulus of whatever scenario
[00:58:34] <Delf> Only in accordance
[00:58:46] <biys> but i don't summarize their idea as the culmination of the experience as it transcends space and time
[01:00:12] <biys> for example.  mass death isn't really bad... just depends how you're looking at it.  the millions of tons of wildebeest carcass after a failed migration could be looked at as catastrophic!
[01:00:26] <biys> but in the end, the net possitive for the ecosystem is what's important
[01:00:39] <I_Am_M00t> :|
[01:00:55] <seed0> agreed
[01:01:00] <audrey> Well, perhaps things can be good or bad for certain people (or certain entities), but I have serious reservations about something being good or bad in a vacuum.
[01:01:08] *** Quits: aqua (~sid742412@user/aqua) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:01:18] <audrey> There is a subtle semantic shift between «bad» and «bad for»
[01:02:19] <audrey> e.g. it is bad for me to contract cholera, but that´s not an ethical pronouncement

[01:02:39] <audrey> I feel like this distinction often doesn´t get teased out.
[01:03:57] <biys> someone would say "when is it EVER bad someone gets cholera?!"
[01:04:00] <biys> and the conversation is ended there
[01:04:09] <biys> i think it goes to show the basic thinking
[01:04:11] <audrey> Well, yes, that´s true.
[01:04:26] <audrey> All ethical or axiological arguments ultimately have to appeal to some sort of human intuition.

[01:05:01] <biys> i think it goes to uh...  the neo-geocentrism
[01:05:03] <audrey> If you are speaking to someone who simply doesn´t possess the relevant human intuition (e.g. a sociopath), then you simply will never convince the person, and the conversation must end.
[01:05:15] <biys> where we think that the human experience, in the universe, is the only thing that matters
[01:05:18] <biys> and it's like... no
[01:05:21] <biys> that isn't really right
[01:05:27] <audrey> This basic problem has agonized philosophers going back all the way to Kant and before
[01:05:47] <audrey> Hence Kant´s obsession with a categorical moral imperative that somehow transcends the moral intuition
[01:06:06] <biys> i've never read Kant.  i should.

[01:06:47] <biys> You are a born narcissist. You know you are conscious, and you don’t worry about whether others are too, because only your experiences matter. The world is a stage for the drama of your life. You are reality’s epicenter.
[01:07:24] <audrey> I don´t think it´s narcissistic to admit that morality is ultimately a human construct.

[01:08:07] <audrey> Scientific American? More like Woke American lately
[01:08:11] <audrey> But let me look at the article
[01:08:16] <biys> But recently prominent scientists and philosophers have been propagating ideas that restore us—more specifically, our minds, or consciousness--to the center of things. I call this perspective neo-geocentrism.
[01:08:20] <biys> you don't have to
[01:08:38] <biys> it's a proclemation that we're returning to geocentric ideas but in the realm of human experience

[02:12:13] <Ungwelian> In Finland, it's not legal, but "it happens" behind the scenes.
[02:12:29] <mannequin> the problem with this way of euthanasia is it can be decided by an impulse, not deductive process that was going on for at least months
[02:12:33] <audrey> This seems like exactly the sort of thing that should be done in private, without the government taking an interest one way or the other.
[02:12:49] <I_Am_M00t> i don't think it's quite that simple
[02:12:49] <mannequin> or someone might get drunk or high and find it a good idea
[02:12:53] <I_Am_M00t> it's a process
[02:12:59] <Ungwelian> Some nurses, for example, can see a person being in prolonged pain, beg for death for months, and then arrange things so that the person dies.
[02:13:17] <audrey> Death is too personal for this sort of pomp.
[02:13:40] <Ungwelian> However, if this is officially approved, it could _easily_ lead to pressure on hospital staff to cut costs of elderly care.

[02:14:33] <Ungwelian> And marketing.
[02:14:41] <audrey> Bakunin: Aren´t exit bags a helluva lot cheaper? Why would anyone want to spend $$ on this machinery?
[02:15:09] <I_Am_M00t> it would have to be done by independent parties, and not the hospital itself
[02:15:22] <Ungwelian> Yeah. Those can be bough, however.
[02:15:28] <Ungwelian> *bought
[02:15:28] <I_Am_M00t> yup
[02:15:41] <I_Am_M00t> you'd have to make it such that there's very little money to gain
[02:15:43] <audrey> > Euthanasia advocate Dr. Philip Nitschke gestures as he speaks to members of the Hemlock Society at the Bahia Resort January 12, 2003 in San Diego, California.
[02:15:49] <audrey> the Hemlock Society hasn´t been around in years
[02:16:00] <audrey> (unless I´m seriously misremembering something)
[02:16:22] <audrey> rather odd that they should use this photograph
[02:17:01] <Ungwelian> I can already imagine the marketing speech: "We must give people the right for their own death. At the same time, we must take responsibility for care. At the moment, there is no room for new patients."
[02:17:39] <Ungwelian> So instead of funding more care, get a faster turnover rate.
[02:18:12] <Ungwelian> And you can push it further with strong, mind-altering drugs, especially for patients whom nobody visits.
[02:18:24] <I_Am_M00t> make it illegal in cramped hospitals then :)
[02:18:31] <audrey> Psychiatric hospitals should be illegal.
[02:19:30] <mannequin> no, they're good ggigs sometimes
[02:19:40] <mannequin> saved my arse a couple of times
[02:19:43] <audrey> I like to think that in 100 years psychiatry will be seen as a pathetic joke the same way phrenology is today
[02:20:09] <Ungwelian> Often when thinking about this stuff, I feel like we should have some kind of modern Inquisition. I guess it's called "accreditation" and "justice system", though.

[02:27:33] <Bakunin> audrey - death as a service
[02:27:53] <Ungwelian> At least the quality of psychiatric care in Finland is often really appalling.
[02:28:34] <Ungwelian> Overmedicating with drugs that don't work and have major side-effects, while witholding drugs that work.
[02:29:03] <Ungwelian> And using psychiatric language as part of stripping the patient of their rights.
[02:29:20] <I_Am_M00t> it's brainwashing
[02:29:36] <audrey> Bakunin: So, death as a neatly packaged commercial product?
[02:30:01] <audrey> This seems subtly different from the old-school, Jack Kevorkian style pro-euthanasia mentality.

[02:43:11] <audrey> God, this is sick lol
[02:43:16] <I_Am_M00t> the thing is, death is already monetized... expensive funerals
[02:43:22] <I_Am_M00t> so it's a moot point
[02:43:34] <Bakunin> I thinks it's awesome
[02:43:37] <I_Am_M00t> the death itself will probably be a fraction of what the funeral costs

[02:47:06] <I_Am_M00t> they're monetizing death
[02:48:12] <Ungwelian> Funeral services monetize the disposal of a body.
[02:48:21] <Ungwelian> Death pods monetize death.
[02:48:38] <I_Am_M00t> i don't see a big difference, morally
[02:48:47] <I_Am_M00t> i think the whole funeral thing is kinda reprehensive too

[02:52:38] <Ungwelian> And as third party, add hospitals :P
[02:52:51] <Bakunin> Ungwelian yes.  Do you believe the State should provide Death Pods?

[02:57:16] <Ungwelian> Something along the lines of dying as a heroine of the people, inspiring humanitarian revolutions for a good while, leading to better life all around.
[02:57:31] <Ungwelian> Fat chance of that happening, though :D
[02:58:16] <Bakunin> so you want to be martyred
[02:58:27] <Bakunin> but you're upset about people who are old or in incurable pain, etc
[02:58:31] <Bakunin> weird man
[02:59:10] <Ungwelian> Some of my relatives work in elderly care. I know death isn't usually beautiful.
[02:59:29] <Ungwelian> Sometimes it's quick, sometimes quite slow.
[03:00:57] <Ungwelian> If you have humanitarian nurses, I can believe they could perform euthanasia morally.

[03:03:36] <Ungwelian> Instead, they're there because they've been pressured to go there.

[14:42:30] <amigojapan> brigand: Torrent too risky in Japan. They are putting people 10 years in jail for it
[14:43:42] <brigand> get a vpn
[14:44:49] <amigojapan> brigand: they will raid your home if you're ISP logs you uploading over 30gb. And you can't explain why well
[14:45:06] <brigand> oh, we had this discussion before. apologies
[14:45:11] <amigojapan> VPN is useless
[14:45:20] <amigojapan> It's ok
[14:45:54] <shea> Just don't seed

[14:46:23] <shea> I'd sooner be a leech than be in jail
[14:46:23] <brigand> but yeah, there are streaming sites too
[14:46:30] <amigojapan> brigand: the only solution is both a VPN and a seed box outside Japan. But that's expensive too. May as well pay for Netflix
[14:46:31] <mannequin> well
[14:46:39] <mannequin> usually they warn you if you seed
[14:46:54] <mannequin> if you keep doing that they ban your access to rthe network
[14:47:03] <brigand> shea: better look for streaming sites then
[14:47:10] <mannequin> jail is if you went full retard
[14:47:13] <shea> I think I'll keep leeching
[14:47:25] <mannequin> something something usenet

[14:47:47] <mannequin> also who cares abour this bullshit content you can get from there
[14:48:12] <amigojapan> shea:  downloading without uploading is punished with 2 years in jail
[14:48:23] <mannequin> are you buying 10TB SAS drives to build storage full of data you will never use?
[14:48:36] <mannequin> depends on the country
[14:48:46] <mannequin> in my country downloading is ok
[14:48:54] <mannequin> unless it's pirated software

[14:51:49] *** blkshp_a is now known as blkshp
[14:52:11] <mannequin> japan has reasons to do that
[14:52:14] <shea> amigojapan: I won't be uploading anything. If they see me downloading a lot, there would be a myriad of explanations that I could proffer
[14:52:16] <mannequin> they build tech
[14:52:21] <amigojapan> shea: that has nothing to do with vpns or proxies
[14:52:49] <shea> amigojapan: Sure it does. If I'm behind a VPN, they can't see my traffic other than that I'm connected to a VPN
[14:53:23] <shea> They would struggle to come up with sufficient proof that I was committing copyright infringement through torrenting. They simply could not know
[14:53:25] <amigojapan> shea: you upload download gigabytes will get bigger anyway
[14:53:40] <shea> amigojapan: I wouldn't upload anything. I would throttle my upload
[14:53:47] <shea> I do throttle my upload
[14:54:40] <amigojapan> Well it is risky to brake the law anyway
[14:55:30] <shea> Of course. But you can mitigate that risk to acceptable levels
[14:56:02] <amigojapan> I rather not take the risk. The reward is not worth it
[14:56:16] <shea> What do you estimate the risk to be?
[14:56:27] <amigojapan> Jail time
[14:56:54] <shea> Yes, but what is the risk of jail time if using a properly configured torrent client and vpn?
[14:57:08] <amigojapan> shea: dunno. Maybe some friend can rat you out to the police
[14:57:19] <mannequin> vpn providers will give your data away to law enforcement if you seed
[14:57:42] <mannequin> echelon is on the wach
[14:59:06] <shea> I'm in some disbelief that copyright infringement would be pursued with that much vigrour in Japan. The department handling that sort of crime must be enormous, with incredibility sophisticated technology, as well as an amply staffed tip line. That must cost the country dearly.
[14:59:41] <mnemon> tip line for what?
[14:59:55] <shea> For reporting copyright infringement, as amigojapan suggested might happen
[15:00:15] <amigojapan> I said rat you out to the police
[15:00:35] <amigojapan> That needs no tip line
[15:00:37] <shea> Well of course. The police would necessarily have to refer that person on to the appropriate departments surely
[15:01:15] <shea> Well I imagine that if it such a crime that is so servere that someone would rat a person out over it, it must have a high enough incident rate to necessitate a more rigourous process to deal with those reports
[15:01:23] <amigojapan> I am sure they have a phone number
[15:01:24] <shea> Sort of like a murder tip line
[15:01:55] <shea> Well yes, a phone number staffed by many many employees to deal with the incredible amount of reports they must get
[15:02:31] <arryana> are you going to pay the legal fees and maintain the life which will be destroyed by whomever you are advising to break the law, shea?
[15:02:47] <shea> I'm speaking hypothetically of course
[15:02:51] <arryana> uh huh
[15:03:08] <mnemon> amigojapan: is the 2 years the maximum sentence, normal or minimum?
[15:03:10] <arryana> yeah, cause it would take a real piece of work to encourage someone else to break laws.
[15:03:20] <shea> What kind of piece of work would that be?
[15:03:26] * arryana shrugs
[15:03:27] <mannequin> japanese chip crackers stay in the shadows
[15:03:30] <arryana> i think that's self evident
[15:03:35] <amigojapan> mnemon: I think maximum for only downloading
[15:03:47] <mnemon> I'm guessing it means the usual punishment is fines at most
[15:03:50] <mannequin> because if they get tracked their life is in danger
[15:04:02] <mannequin> not jail, straight up execution
[15:04:05] <shea> Really? Do you mind if we engage in some Socratic dialogue to get to the essence of what it would mean to encourage others to break the law?
[15:04:08] <mannequin> japs are serious about this
[15:04:22] <arryana> you can engage in whatever you like, it's nothing to me.
[15:04:22] <shea> Of course, Aquanis advocated for breaking the law where the law was unjust
[15:04:44] <shea> In fact, breaking man-made law is an essential element of natural law theory
[15:04:55] <shea> Where that law is unjust
[15:04:56] <mannequin> they don't sell many of their inventions outside domestic market
[15:05:01] <mannequin> national security
[15:05:01] <arryana> good luck with that.
[15:05:37] <amigojapan> I brake some laws from time to time. But this law. I rather just miss the TV shows, they are probably boring anyway. And I have plenty to watch on YouTube
[15:05:37] <arryana> if you wanna be a renegade, go for it.  trying to coerce other people into it is not cool.
[15:05:58] <shea> arryana: What a shame. Making such servere statements, but being unwanting to get into the nitty gritty
[15:06:10] <arryana> i think i did get to the nitty gritty
[15:06:19] <arryana> pay your own consequences, don't try to get someone else to do it.
[15:06:47] <shea> Seems awfully categorical. May I take you to 1930s Germany perhaps?
[15:07:13] <arryana> go fuck yourself.
[15:07:18] <amigojapan> Brb
[15:07:19] <shea> Hahahahaahahaha
[15:07:23] <mannequin> i do that all the time
[15:07:32] * arryana sets /ignore
[15:09:50] <shea> So close to a real philosophical conversation, to end like that so abruptly. A great loss.
[15:10:22] <brigand> shea: have you tried youtube-dl or videodownloadhelper to rip streaming sites? it should give you faster access
[15:11:04] <shea> I use yt-dlp and mpv sometimes. To be honest, I rarely torrent or watch anything
[15:11:14] <brigand> oh, i see
[15:11:58] <shea> I will keep that in mind next time I do, thanks for the tip
[15:12:08] <brigand> sure

[21:14:47] <biys> yah.  i mean...  definitely.  JBP talks to this a bit
[21:14:58] <biys> with regards to impiulsivity and bad decisions based on level of understanding
[21:15:12] <biys> which would relate to ones ability to perceive the future
[21:15:36] <biys> this is likely due to a few things. as your level of experience increases in navigating the world you're likely to become more successful at it
[21:15:57] <biys> but marginalized folk tend to have to worry about more trivial aspects of life (not really trivial though)

[21:43:03] <ash_worksi> I swear I fell insane half my life
[21:43:23] <ash_worksi> like a lobotomized monkey working a puzzle
[21:43:58] <pussipupu> “felt insane” or like “fell ill”?
[21:44:01] <causative> imagine if we had taxed automation all along, then we'd still be in the stone age
[21:44:54] <causative> no water wheels, no windmills, no oxen or dogs - those all steal human jobs
[21:45:29] <ash_worksi> feel*
[21:47:39] <arryana> you'd be better off discussing that with a medical professional than a chat room.
[21:48:02] <brigand> causative: black and white think
[21:48:10] <ash_worksi> honestly, I don't think so
[21:48:43] <pussipupu> Ah, or that of course, sorry
[21:49:01] <pussipupu> Honestly I don't know how I'd know how it feels to be sane or insane
[21:49:13] <causative> imagine if the Luddites had had their way, then we'd still have a large section of the population weaving by hand and a T-shirt would cost $300
[21:51:04] <brigand> extremism
[21:51:38] <biys> lol
[21:51:55] <ash_worksi> you can probably tell if you feel debilitated by your intent being oppsite to your affect most of the time
[21:51:56] <arryana> either way, it's a personal problem that nobody here is qualified or obligated to answer.
[21:52:49] <biys> lobotomized monkey working a puzzle
[21:52:54] <biys> what would that even look like?
[21:53:03] <ash_worksi> it was an actual experiment
[21:53:09] <ash_worksi> the monkey was not happy
[21:53:10] <biys> i don't doubt it
[21:53:19] <biys> but i just don't have any kind of que to gleem from what you're talking about
[21:53:34] <biys> can you try another analogy?
[21:53:45] <ash_worksi> it was enraged by the fact (supposedly) that it could do a task it was able to do before
[21:54:14] <biys> so you're saying you're enraged as a result of your ideas you were more capable previously in life?
[21:55:03] <arryana> you don't seem to be making a lot of sense right now.
[21:56:15] <causative> if you're concerned about low-IQ people without jobs reproducing, the kindest thing you can do for them is to provide free public education and empowerment for women - this reduces the birth rate
[21:56:40] <biys> causative: you see what musk said about birth rates recently?
[21:56:51] <causative> when women are more educated and career-oriented they don't have 5 kids
[21:57:02] <causative> no
[21:57:16] <biys> i'm pretty sure it's well established that birth rates are declining significantly
[21:57:23] <biys> aaand..  it's not a good thing
[21:57:42] <biys> unless you're discussing the fitness of children
[21:57:48] <biys> i'm not sure what you're suggesting
[21:57:57] <biys> we need lower birth rates YET?
[21:58:12] <causative> <biys> it was when he was talking about how low IQ positions are being automated too quickly
[21:58:12] <causative> <biys> without any kind of significant plan for what we're gonna do with people who have lower IQ
[21:58:34] <causative> educate women, best way to reduce the birth rate
[21:58:44] <biys> and you think reduced birth rates is a good thing?
[22:00:00] <causative> if there's a low-IQ segment of the population that is reproducing more than the rest, yes
[22:00:07] <biys> not to mention reduced birth rates by EDUCATED folk none the less
[22:00:15] <biys> i'm not following your logic on this
[22:00:40] <biys> i would think we'd want the educated people to produce more
[22:00:44] <biys> and the uneducated peopel to produce less
[22:00:47] <causative> educate the lower-IQ people
[22:00:52] <biys> when it comes to the fitness of children
[22:00:54] <causative> lower the barriers to entry
[22:00:57] <biys> and their ability to be successful in the future
[22:01:19] * pussipupu goes back to punching morpholoyg
[22:01:21] <pussipupu> Only with spelling :þ
[22:01:32] <causative> making college free won't have much impact on the birth rates of already-educated people
[22:01:42] <causative> it will reduce the birth rates of those who otherwise could not have afforded college
[22:01:58] <biys> i doubt those people would be able to go to college... even if it's free
[22:02:16] <biys> their series of mistakes has already aligned itself in such a way
[22:02:24] <biys> likely limiting their potential cmopletely
[22:02:32] <biys> unless, by some act of god, they get some kind of windfall
[22:02:36] <biys> generally speaking
[22:03:18] * arryana wonders how one punches morphology
[22:03:27] <causative> almost everyone can go to college
[22:04:00] <biys> i think child care where i live is something like $1500 a month
[22:04:16] <biys> "free college" isn't even the start of the fix
[22:05:01] <causative> it's part of empowering women to not be trapped in a generational cycle of having as many kids as possible
[22:05:32] <causative> it's the most powerful effect, you see that as standards of living and education rises in poorer countries, birth rates sharply drop
[22:05:45] <biys> again... i don't see how birth rates dropping is a good thing
[22:07:56] <causative> you seem to be bouncing between two positions:  "it's not a good thing to reduce birth rates" and "educating/empowering poor women won't reduce birth rates among them"
[22:08:25] <causative> since you are falling back to the first position, can we take it that you have abandoned the second?
[22:08:30] <biys> what you're talking about is taking peopel who are already marginalized to some extent
[22:08:43] <biys> your proposal is that we just educate them out of their situation
[22:08:56] <biys> i'm saying... they likely will be unable to partake of the education as a result of barriers
[22:09:06] <causative> well pick one
[22:09:19] <causative> if I successfully argue against one of the two positions you can't just immediately fall back to the other
[22:10:11] <causative> call "it's not a good thing to reduce birth rates" position #1, and "educationg/empowering poor women won't reduce birth rates among them" position #2
[22:10:31] <biys> well y our second position works on the premise that reduced birth rates is GOOD
[22:10:52] <biys> education = reduced birth rates = success
[22:10:55] <causative> so you were just talking about #1, then you switched to #2, and now you're back to #1
[22:11:12] <biys> and i'm not really sure how this aligns at all
[22:11:13] <brigand> i was the one who argued for reduced birth rates
[22:11:24] <brigand> well, not really argued heh
[22:11:29] <causative> reduced birth rates *among poor and uneducated* is a good thing, considering their birth rates are already higher than average
[22:11:39] <causative> that's the response to your position #1
[22:12:15] <causative> and educating/empowering women has worked fantastically to reduce birth rates among third world subsistence farmers, who were as poor and uneducated as it gets
[22:12:19] <causative> that's the response to your position #2
[22:13:48] <brigand> low-iq people will still be low-iq people though
[22:14:53] <causative> but there will be reduced numbers of them

[23:49:50] <causative> it's important that it's okay to be wrong
[23:50:58] <causative> if you think being wrong is unacceptable failure, then you'll try to twist the situation and your words so that you refuse to admit error
[23:51:37] <causative> and the same goes on the other side:  we must treat admissions of error as okay, not as unacceptable failure
[23:52:24] <causative> the culture must be that it's okay to be wrong
[23:53:53] <brigand> there's a difference between "being wrong" and "admitting that you were wrong"
