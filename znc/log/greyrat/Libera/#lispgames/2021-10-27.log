[00:21:05] <dthompson> I am going to play so many of y'alls games tomorrow. busy day today, couldn't find any extra time to rate.
[00:21:33] <dthompson> dto: just watching the danceball video now. I love the vibe.
[00:24:12] <dto> thanks dthompson !! :)
[00:30:55] <dthompson> retro video game dance floor
[00:31:03] <dthompson> love the grid that pops in and out with the beat
[00:46:18] <dto> yeah! :)
[00:46:23] <dto> all part of the sprite sheet.
[00:46:31] <dto> i'm making another video now that i fixed some bugs and improved some other stuff. 
[01:10:01] <dto> dthompson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wqqGvkh-Lc
[01:46:21] <borodust> rtypo: i think i fixed black screen issue for alien-works on windows for some devices, if you have time, could you plz check if https://github.com/borodust/notalone-thriced/releases/download/v1.0.1/notalone-thriced-game-win10-x86_64.zip works for you on windows (just unzip and run app.exe)

[03:07:59] <rtypo> borodust: hi, just seen the message. i'm on linux, not windows. should i check the linux release?
[03:08:14] <rtypo> i finally get to say "i use arch btw"
[03:09:43] <rtypo> eh, you're probably logged off. i'll check the linux release anyway. just in case
[03:16:47] <rtypo> borodust: done, on my *linux* it works. i got 25 points!
[03:25:15] <rtypo> btw my CPU doesn't have AVX, but the game still works (reading your+azimut comments)
[03:26:45] <dto> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb6-BrgQ-mw borodust :)
[03:27:10] <dto> the shields are just little sparkly lines around the ship, kinda renders small here but it blocks correctly oriented bullets with a sound...

[15:57:49] <peterhil> dto: Good that you have the dance pad shown on lower right cornoer now. The videos make much more sense when you see the foot work. Do you need to tap the pads exactly is does the whole surface work?
[15:57:56] <dthompson> dto: I just watched your other danceball video (was afk when you sent it to me yesterday) and I think I just had a psychadelic experience.
[15:58:29] <dthompson> are you using OBS to make these videos? 
[15:58:50] <peterhil> I mean, you could dance much more naturally, if the whole surface works as pad areas.
[15:59:04] <dthompson> screencasting used to suck so hard on linux, obs makes it so easy capture game footage and stream.

[18:22:26] <technomancy> dthompson: you got them all to run?
[18:25:31] <peterhil> dthompson: I am also interested, if you tried to run some of them from the sources, as I have old Mac systems (Mojave and High Sierra) and 32-bit Arch Linux.
[18:25:54] <dthompson> technomancy: almost all of them.
[18:26:07] <dthompson> peterhil: I used binary builds for all but 1
[18:26:39] <dthompson> any problems I had were quickly addressed when I left a comment with the error info.

[18:38:23] <dto> mfiano: it didn't work out, i started working on this larger project 
[18:38:24] *** Joins: zap (~zap@gateway/tor-sasl/zap)
[18:38:46] <dto> peterhil: the arrows have to be tapped on the beat.
[18:38:57] <dto> the firing is done with X and O (upper left and upper right arrows0
[18:39:10] <dto> dthompson: yes, OBS :)
[18:45:53] <dto> yeah, so to trigger vertical shields you jump on UP/DOWn simultaneously. to trigger horizontal shields, LEFT/RIGHT simultaneously. which means... you can't do it on a controller d-pad.
[18:49:23] <dto> i  think i will need to decide at this point whether to really require the dance pad. i think it's thhe only way to make it work. 
[18:50:11] <dto> i.e. i can design the game around the dance pad and make it really shine, or always run into stuff that won't work on a controller. ..
[18:50:35] <dto> maybe there could be alternate controls like left/right bumper for shields 
[18:50:37] <dto> i dunno

[19:07:42] <peterhil> dto: On my game you can actually press multiple buttons simultaneously to advance multiple hexagons in a turn. So maybe some combinations could work? Even on a d-pad you could use Knami code like combinations in time...
[19:07:56] <dto> peterhil: hmm! yes
[19:08:06] <peterhil> Think youside the grid! :-D
[19:09:54] <peterhil> Mortal kombat is a good example of these kind of controls.
[19:12:21] <peterhil> Just a inifinite stream of button events, constantly take N first buttons and match against patterns.
[19:12:50] <dto> Right I was just thinking to match them on a running basis.
[19:12:57] <peterhil> RX style libraries like Kefir, Bacon and RX.js do this on Javascript using the observer pattern.
[19:13:14] <dto> I will let you know what happens! Now that I've got the basics working, it's time to review all the code 
[19:13:23] <dto> And review the design itself and come up with a better design
[19:13:29] <dto> Oh yeah?
[19:13:42] <dto> I was thinking of translating two strings and using CL - ppcre
[19:14:00] <dto> Translating steps To strings*
[19:14:07] <peterhil> https://github.com/kefirjs/kefir/blob/master/src/stream.js
[19:16:16] <peterhil> Using reactive streams you can keep the code declarative.
[19:20:19] <dto> hmm!
[19:23:33] <peterhil> Using FRP is a bit different, and might feel weird at first. I use it on my Spellbook browser extension, so here is a usage example: https://github.com/peterhil/spellbook/blob/ngram-autocomplete/src/js/components/CategorySearch.svelte#L40
[19:23:38] <peterhil> See also https://rxmarbles.com/
[19:26:22] <peterhil> CombineLatest could maybe work for getting last button presses: https://rxmarbles.com/#combineLatest
[19:28:23] <peterhil> Both Lua and Common Lisp have least some libraries for reactive programming: * https://github.com/bjornbytes/RxLua * https://github.com/yorodm/cl-rx
[19:32:05] <peterhil> Basically you first define what kind of events you want to stream, and then modify and combine the streams. Then you attach a function to the stream with it’s observer. Before you listen to a stream, nothing happens.
[19:39:25] <dthompson> okay, I think I've rated everything I am able to now. finally.
