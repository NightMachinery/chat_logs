[12:49:33] <gahr> works like a charm here
[12:50:30] <gahr> together with bind editor <Space>     noop
[12:53:00] <Kinnison> gahr: does that not break filename, label, etc. completion?
[12:58:42] <gahr> no
[12:59:41] <gahr> the editor knows what it's working on 
[13:00:39] <gahr> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/773bd03989df877ab0a4e715145badf54d2b3a14/mutt.h#L51
[13:03:06] <Kinnison> Okay, so file completion looks like it'd work with either complete or complete-query being triggered, but label or pattern completion wouldn't
[13:03:51] <gahr> why?
[13:04:08] <Kinnison> https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/38ddf36983d6f03120a25133a756881a88ce3a0c/enter/enter.c#L546

[13:09:16] <Kinnison> if that stricture, and the one 20 lines further down were loosened, I think it'd be fine to map tab to complete-query and then just have my query_command also process my alias file

[13:14:29] <gahr> I'm not sure I totally understand, but I think it would make sense to run the same code for both OP_EDITOR_COMPLETE_QUERY and OP_EDITOR_COMPLETE except for MUTT_COMP_ALIAS
[13:14:50] <gahr> like, EDITOR_COMPLETE and EDITOR_COMPLETE_QUERY would be synonims for everything but alias completion?
[13:15:20] <Kinnison> That's effectively what I'm saying, yes
[13:15:22] <gahr> I don't think I would extend the query complete external protocol to other things
[13:15:38] <gahr> ok, yes I think that makes sense
[13:15:43] <Kinnison> Independently of that, it'd be awesome if there were a way to do the equivalent of mutt_expand_alises() which uses the query_command
[13:16:02] <Kinnison> so if I'm composing a mail to alias1,alias2,alias3 I can have those expanded via query_command
[13:16:23] <Kinnison> but that's entirely new capabilities, rather than just tweaking existing functionality a little
[13:16:31] <gahr> how would you differentiate that from complete query?
[13:16:59] <Kinnison> In what sense?
[13:17:18] <gahr> I mean, foo<tab>
[13:17:39] <gahr> it calls query_complete
[13:17:55] <gahr> oh, you mean an entirely new command
[13:18:13] <gahr> that does something different than complete-query ?
[13:18:16] <Kinnison> well, ideally I mean a way to tap it into the code which currently does mutt_expand_aliases() in the send code
[13:18:49] <gahr> but isn't that complete-alias under EDITOR_COMPLETE (without query)?
[13:19:37] <Kinnison> I'm not certain what that means; let me try giving you a use-case because I'm not certain I'm using the right words
[13:20:24] <Kinnison> 1. I hit m to send an email.  The 'To:' editor pops up.  If I type an alias name and press enter, it will be expanded automatically.  I'd like a way to have that use the query command too.
[13:21:13] <Kinnison> 2. I am composing an email and I hit t to edit the 'To' I add ,bar,baz to the line and hit enter.  The bar and baz aliases expand automatically.  Ditto I'd like that to be able to use query command
[13:21:27] <Kinnison> Does that make more sense?
[13:22:51] <gahr> would it be equivalent to teach your query_command to inspect your alias file, in addition to whatever it's doing?
[13:23:05] <gahr> I mean, the query command gets whatever is in the To: prompt, not matter whether it's a name, alias, addres..
[13:23:41] <Kinnison> I am fine with making my tool notice if it's already an address and passing that back untouched.
[13:24:12] <Kinnison> And yes, my intent is for my tool to be able to complete against an alias file (so I can still add entries to it using neomutt) as well as LDAP for work, and a YAML address book format I use elsewhere for various things
[13:24:23] <Kinnison> Possibly even my google contacts list at some point too
[13:24:44] * Kinnison is probably overcomplicating his life, but enjoys writing such tools
[13:27:37] <gahr> that's fine, but I still don't get what changes would need to be done in neomutt
[13:27:48] <gahr> isn't the logic all in the tool?
[13:28:57] <Kinnison> let me look up the code I was struggling with, one sec
[13:31:56] <Kinnison> So, lots of places call mutt_expand_aliases() or mutt_expand_aliases_env() e.g. https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/ec24fbca8797eac71cb79f4e7184482c72ed24e6/send/send.c#L196
[13:32:14] <Kinnison> the bounce commands, anything which reads an address field, processes envelopes, etc.
[13:37:43] * Kinnison imagines something like, just before https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/ec24fbca8797eac71cb79f4e7184482c72ed24e6/alias/alias.c#L109 there could be code akin to:
[13:39:24] <dob1> hi, does neomutt support compressed email messages ?
[13:40:18] <Kinnison> if (cs_subset_bool(NeoMutt->sub, "expand_aliases_with_query_command") && !alias) { alias = query_complete(...) }
[13:40:42] <Kinnison> naturally that'd need tweaking since rather than popping up a dialog, we should just only expand if a single result is returned I think
[13:42:00] <Kinnison> Hmm, no, that'd break group aliases, we'd need a way to signal to the query command that it was being asked to complete in this context instead
[13:42:40] <Kinnison> as expected, my "If only it could do X" is much more complex than I thought it might be :D

[13:48:54] <gahr> Kinnison: ok I see your point. So basically everywhere there's an alias expansion, you want to do it via an external tool
[13:49:44] <gahr> I was only thinking about <tab> expansion..

[15:45:11] <flatcap> morning all
[15:45:14] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[15:45:18] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[15:45:33] * flatcap reads Kinnison's rambling :-)...
[15:46:06] <gahr> what do we do, make the mailbox unhidden while we mx_fastclose_mailbox() it?
[15:47:26] <flatcap> pardon?  are you referring to #3152?
[15:47:27] <neo-bot> Issue by @larsks "Neomutt segfaulting when IMAP connection is lost": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3152
[15:48:26] <flatcap> urgh, ugly but that'd probably do the trick
[15:49:40] *** Joins: bsd4me (~bsduser@user/bsd4me)
[15:50:12] <gahr> :) yes
[15:51:04] <gahr> or we let mx_fastclose_mailbox return true if it has removed the mailbox
[15:51:22] <gahr> which wouldn't be enough
[15:52:01] <gahr> what we don't want to kill is the account (and its data)
[15:52:17] <flatcap> and have dangling adata ptrs
[15:52:20] <gahr> yeah
[15:52:40] <gahr> perhaps bool keep_account to mx_fastclose_mailbox, which passes it to mx_ac_remove ?
[15:53:07] <flatcap> hmm... that's a bit cleaner
[15:53:30] * flatcap counts callers to mx_fastclose_mailbox()
[15:53:48] <flatcap> 18
[15:54:15] <gahr> cmd_handle_fatal is a mess, anyway
[15:54:23] * Kinnison wonders what flatcap thinks of the ramblings
[15:54:29] <gahr> what happens inside the if happens inside imap_close_connection too
[15:54:34] <Kinnison> if it's too crazy I won't bother filing an issue
[15:55:44] <flatcap> I've only read through it once (and only got some understanding at the end :-)
[15:56:06] <flatcap> I'll read it again, in a sec, but it sounds reasonable
[15:57:20] <flatcap> I like the sound of `foo<tab> -> Jim Foo <foo@example.com>` or even `foo, ` ->
[15:57:22] <gahr> flatcap: I'll try with the flag, if you don't mind
[15:57:36] <flatcap> gahr: great, thanks
[15:58:14] <flatcap> Kinnison: which made me think of a Vim feature with <tab> -> spaces...
[15:58:24] <flatcap> (I can't remember the vim config option)
[15:59:15] <flatcap> if you <tab><tab> and get lots of spaces, then <del> will delete a <tab>'s worth magically (as if it *had* been a <tab>)
[16:00:00] *** Joins: Pali (~pali@user/pali)
[16:00:33] <flatcap> I saw NeoMutt doing `foo<tab>` -> `Jim Foo <foo@example.com>` and <del> or perhaps <Ctrl-Del> would delete an "object" (the entire address)
[16:00:53] * flatcap is easily distracted :-)
[16:01:51] <flatcap> EDITOR_COMPLETE_QUERY not working with labels, etc, is definitely a bug that needs fixing
[16:08:54] <gahr> I thought about it
[16:10:27] <gahr> the fact that case OP_EDITOR_COMPLETE: case OP_EDITOR_COMPLETE_QUERY: are the same branch
[16:10:36] <gahr> makes me think that complete-query should be a boolean?
[16:10:57] <gahr> like, complete_alias_with_query_command = yes | no
[16:11:23] <gahr> that case implies that you *do* want to expand any kind of object when you invoke complete-query
[16:12:32] <gahr> "<complete>: complete filename or alias, <complete-query>: complete address with query" <- this doesn't reflect what we are doing
[16:12:32] <flatcap> hmm... that would stop you using both. (are there people who have an alias file AND use a query?)
[16:13:05] <flatcap> yes
[16:13:12] <gahr> ok so you would use both, but also want to trigger filename, label, etc. expansion with complete-query?
[16:13:35] <flatcap> yes
[16:13:42] <gahr> ok
[16:14:17] <gahr> then we need to remove a few & (ch == OP_EDITOR_COMPLETE) from that branch
[16:14:21] <Kinnison> For me, the critical convenience thing will be if mutt_expand_aliases() calls elsewhere also use the query command
[16:14:27] <flatcap> Kinnison: there are 16 mutt_expand_aliases()s - https://gist.github.com/flatcap/74505508f0baaccb7de278553882b8cc
[16:15:54] <flatcap> would they all want upgrading?
[16:16:13] <flatcap> would they need any extra data? (prob not)
[16:16:28] <Kinnison> I'm imagining a worst they'll need a NeoMutt->sub type argument
[16:16:37] <Kinnison> But I don't know the interior of neomutt very well
[16:16:43] <flatcap> ok, that's no problem
[16:16:50] * Kinnison is at the greps-source-and-guesses stage with it :D
[16:17:08] * flatcap wouldn't like to confess the same ;-)
[16:17:58] <flatcap> if you can create some use-cases, some simple walkthroughs of functions, e.g. <mail>, that'd be useful
[16:18:35] <flatcap> then we can work out where all the magic should live
[16:18:44] <gahr> #3164
[16:18:44] <neo-bot> PR by @gahr "Optionally keep an account alive on removal of its last mailbox": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/pull/3164
[16:18:55] * flatcap looks ...
[16:18:57] <flatcap> thanks
[16:19:05] <Kinnison> flatcap: OK, I will do my best :D
[16:19:14] <gahr> I wonder how does the OP end up in a state where you're handling a failing imap with a hidden mailboxc
[16:19:50] <gahr> perhaps if the connection goes down while you're browsing a postponed email?
[16:20:04] <gahr> and the postponed mailbox is the last one attached to the account? mh...
[16:20:29] <flatcap> I suppose any non-`mailboxes`ed mailbox would do
[16:21:07] <gahr> oh!
[16:21:07] <flatcap> we need a verb for 'to use the `mailboxes` command':-)
[16:21:11] <gahr> nice, let me try that
[16:21:28] <gahr> tick-mailboxes-ed-tick
[16:21:35] <flatcap> hehe
[16:21:54] * flatcap wondered about some way to inject faults into the imap backend
[16:23:48] <flatcap> anyway, I've learned an important lesson: tell the OP to build with ASAN sooner
[16:26:17] <gahr> that was a great idea
[16:26:45] <gahr> ok I could crash it by faking an IMAP_REOPEN_ALLOW flag into the mdata->reopen flags
[16:32:46] <flatcap> where's it crashing now?
[16:36:06] <gahr> no I mean with master
[16:36:22] <flatcap> oh, good
[16:36:33] <gahr> empty config, open a folder, kill the connection while you're opening a large message
[16:36:48] <gahr> but now it doesn't recover, either
[16:36:53] <gahr> it just stays there with an empty index
[16:37:05] <flatcap> ok, slightly better
[16:37:09] <gahr> heh yeah
[16:38:46] <flatcap> from there, can you re-open the mailbox?
[16:39:47] <gahr> yes no problem
[16:39:52] <gahr> it just doesn't do it automagically
[16:40:12] <gahr> I guess it's a step :)
[16:40:52] <flatcap> ok, that's bearable.  we haven't left neomutt in an unusable state
[16:41:49] <flatcap> hmm... if we got a cmd_fatal because of a dropped connection, does it make sense to try to reconnect immediately?
[16:41:56] <flatcap> hmm... yes probably
[16:43:21] <gahr> the if at 182 tries to do that, once
[16:43:34] <gahr> let me check why we aren't succeeding, perhaps it's trivial
[16:44:57] <flatcap> thanks
[16:45:08] <gahr> oh, of course
[16:45:16] <gahr> we *are* reconnecting, but we haven't got a mailbox 
[16:45:21] <gahr> so we don't SELECT it
[16:47:30] <flatcap> ah!
[16:47:45] <gahr> and that's because the mailbox is hidden
[16:47:56] <gahr> perhaps the *real* fix would be not to make it hidden :D
[16:49:51] <flatcap> hehe
[16:57:42] <gahr> no, there's no way to reopen a mailbox if you've closed it
[16:57:58] <flatcap> ok
[16:58:11] <gahr> without going through mx_resolve or something
[16:59:49] <flatcap> hmm...
[17:02:02] * gahr tries a few more things
[17:06:15] <Kinnison> flatcap: I've filed https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3165 but I'm bound to have missed some details, so please let me know if anything needs further explanation
[17:06:42] <gahr> flatcap: I can't think of anything else.. let's fix the crash for now?
[17:07:23] <flatcap> Kinnison: thanks
[17:07:35] <flatcap> gahr: yes, thanks

[17:46:20] * flatcap wonders about...
[17:46:26] <flatcap> set alias_expansion_order = "alias,query"
[17:46:55] <Kinnison> did I seriously miss something that simple?
[17:47:15] <flatcap> no, don't worry it doesn't exist
[17:47:16] <Kinnison> oh no, as a solution for #3165 ?
[17:47:17] <neo-bot> Issue by @kinnison "Proposal - Enhance alias expansion via query command": https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/3165
[17:47:23] <flatcap> yes
[17:48:01] <Kinnison> that'd be a good approach, though I still think the query command needs to be told if it's "expanding" or "querying" because a query from ^T/<tab> you want results from a partial match, whereas expansion you want exact-match only
[17:48:40] <flatcap> yeah
[17:49:58] <flatcap> adding flags to the query_command will cause mayhem
[17:50:16] <Kinnison> indeed, hence I suggested an additional config value for the expansion variety
[17:50:24] <Kinnison> that way for me, I can simply pass  --exact to my tooling
[17:52:29] <flatcap> hmm... do we need separate commands / behaviour?
[17:52:52] <Kinnison> to behave just like current alias expansion, yes I think so.
[17:53:15] <flatcap> the user types "foo<tab>" in the "To: " prompt ...
[17:53:21] <Kinnison> that's a completion
[17:53:31] <flatcap> yes, hang on...
[17:53:33] <Kinnison> if the user types "foo<enter>" at the "To: " prompt, it's an expansion
[17:54:03] <flatcap> if the query_command returns one address, we complete
[17:54:21] <flatcap> if it returns multiple, we don't / can't (yet)
[17:54:52] <Kinnison> that would fail to provide the ability to replicate alias groups
[17:54:58] *** Joins: gabriel1 (~gabriel1@user/gabriel1)
[17:55:13] <flatcap> hmm....
[17:55:43] <flatcap> I need more examples
[17:55:44] <Kinnison> unless we extended the query command output format to allow groups to be on a single line
[17:56:26] <flatcap> for every place you'd expect completion and what you'd expect to get back (in a perfect world)
[17:57:09] <Kinnison> So long as we can agree that completion != expansion, then I think I can summarise that fairly well
[17:57:40] <flatcap> great :-)
[17:58:03] <flatcap> yeah, I'm still confusing the two

[18:03:23] <gahr> I'm off'ing soon, and I'll be back on Monday, enjoy the weekend
[18:03:55] <Kinnison> Have a lovely christmas gahr
[18:04:03] <gahr> ah sure, that too :)
