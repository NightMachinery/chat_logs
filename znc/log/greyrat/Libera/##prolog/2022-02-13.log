[01:17:03] <sivoais> aindilis: New version of Yaswi is out! Which version of SWI-Prolog are you using it with?
[01:17:20] <aindilis> hey sivoais! cool! checking
[01:17:39] <aindilis> 8.0.2
[01:18:18] <sivoais> Ah, OK, so you won't hit the symbol conflict which came about in SWI-Prolog V8.1.30.
[01:18:25] <aindilis> oh wow
[01:18:27] <aindilis> ty for the heads u

[01:18:45] *** Quits: Serpent7776 (~Serpent77@90-156-31-193.internetia.net.pl) (Quit: leaving)
[01:18:59] <sivoais> But if you do upgrade your system SWI-Prolog, I've worked around it by automatically building a patched SWI-Prolog as long as that conflict exists.
[01:19:06] <aindilis> great!
[01:19:08] <aindilis> good work!
[01:19:16] <aindilis> (I just finished a really mundate prolog task - using a linked list representing an ordered list, and allowing draggable list item to update the linked list using a minimum of assert/retract)
[01:19:22] <aindilis> *mundane
[01:19:52] <sivoais> Nice, I saw that above in the scrollback yesterday :-)
[01:20:04] <aindilis> cool, yeah I've mostly paired it with FLP now
[01:20:33] <aindilis> what have you been working on lately (in addition to Yaswi)?
[01:21:41] <aindilis> I've been meaning to follow up with you
[01:21:45] <sivoais> I'm doing something with SWIG to make the MXNet Perl package easier to install directly. But hit a snag that somebody already uploaded something in the same namespace back in 2011.
[01:21:46] <aindilis> see how things were
[01:21:49] <aindilis> wow
[01:22:03] <sivoais> Waiting to see if I can take over the namespace with my updated version.
[01:22:04] <aindilis> wow cool
[01:22:29] <aindilis> let me know if you need testers
[01:22:42] <aindilis> er, I guess Perl has that whole framework
[01:23:26] <aindilis> I need to add reminders for following up to the Audience system.  I had a system that used IMAP and computed whose turn it was in conversations.
[01:24:20] <sivoais> heh, I've been carefully watching the CPAN Testers to make sure I'm not breaking portability, but real-world users are infinitely more useful for finding bugs.
[01:24:28] <aindilis> oh okay yeah I'll test it out then
[01:24:34] <aindilis> won't hurt me to use MXNet
[01:25:10] <aindilis> I'm glad you're keeping Yaswi maintained!
[01:25:24] <sivoais> I'm using that as a base for my next thing which is to do the same for a new Tensorflow binding. I've been meaning to get to that since last summer.
[01:25:43] <aindilis> Perl tensorflow?  cool! 
[01:27:09] <aindilis> I've been messing around with Jason (http://jason.sf.net) lately.  I added the ability to call SWIPL from within Jason, and for SWIPL to initiate contact with Jason.
[01:27:23] <aindilis> I need autonomy.
[01:27:51] <aindilis> so I'm working to build out some standard libs for Jason/SWIPL integrations.
[01:30:04] <aindilis> Also working some on cleaning up FRDCSA's git repo, so that I can release everything.
[01:30:11] <sivoais> Oooh, agents!
[01:30:47] <aindilis> Yeah!  I wish Perl had more in the way of Agents, but I can use Jason okay.  I've developed a partial environment in SWIPL for it, since Jason uses Agents + Envs.
[01:31:16] <sivoais> I was looking at NetLogo for that kind of modelling, but it seemed to have limited support for working headless.
[01:31:42] <aindilis> ah, interesting, I remember that!  I think I managed to get Jason to run in the CLI only.
[01:32:08] <sivoais> If it is Java, Inline::Java might work, but I haven't tried it.
[01:32:38] <sivoais> I know the current maintainer for Inline::Java (we work on PDL together) so if anything breaks there, I know who to ping
[01:32:54] <aindilis> Oh, hey hadn't even thought of that, that's a good idea! I use Inline::Java for most systems, but I hadn't thought to hook Perl up to Jason.
[01:33:01] <aindilis> I set up my smart lights to change colors (to red or white) based on how productive I am, and they just changed to white, which means I'm not being productive enough right now hehe :(
[01:33:37] <aindilis> Oh I know why, I disconnected my ERC instances from UniLang, so they can't update it.
[01:34:34] <aindilis> I think the problem was they were sending too many messages to Audience...
[01:36:18] <aindilis> *for most Java systems
[01:36:36] <aindilis> what are you using Tensorflow for?
[01:36:50] <aindilis> That's cool that you're so well connected in the Perl world.
[01:37:02] <aindilis> I've been doing mainly Prolog recently.
[01:37:13] <aindilis> But I rely so heavily on CPAN

[01:49:45] <sivoais> aindilis: I want to start doing deep learning. When I first learned ML in uni, deep learning was rather new and I never had a use for it since the applications didn't really fit in my area (biomedical imaging)
[01:50:31] <sivoais> But since I have an interest in NLP which is separate from biomedical imaging, I would like to use it there.
