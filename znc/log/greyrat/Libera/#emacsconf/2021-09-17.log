[03:51:17] <blackbeard> Hello everyone 
[03:52:38] <ieure> arrrrrr
[04:00:04] <blackbeard> I have a few ideas:
[04:00:04] <blackbeard> 1. How I discovered Emacs
[04:00:04] <blackbeard> 2. How I started learning
[04:00:05] <blackbeard> 3. Why I use emacs as a lawyer 
[04:00:21] <blackbeard> And maybe some thoughts on it

[05:30:40] <bandali> hey blackbeard, sounds like a good starting point!
[05:31:13] <bandali> i'd be interested in hearing more about each of the points in more details, especially the third one (but the first two as well)

[07:23:57] <blackbeard> bandali: hey 
[07:23:57] <blackbeard> 1. What I did before Emacs and GNU/Linux.
[07:23:57] <blackbeard> How I started with GNU/Linux, my first distribution, how I started with Emacs and why I stopped and came back.
[07:25:26] <blackbeard> 2. The videos I saw, things I tried and my first packages
[07:26:27] <blackbeard> 3. Packages I use for law practice and law school. 
[07:26:38] <blackbeard> Why I use them, and how
[07:30:49] <blackbeard> bandali: maybe a forth about other things I have done and learned with Emacs 
[07:33:55] <bandali> blackbeard, sounds like a great list! keep me/us posted here as you put together your talk proposal :)
[09:03:28] <blackbeard> bandali: will do!
[09:04:17] <bandali> blackbeard, thanks!
