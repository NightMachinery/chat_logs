Using CTRL+ALT+F# I can get to a terminal (which will flash briefly as well if already active prior to suspend) and can run commands, but cannot un-blacken the screen.  Pressing the power button or running systemctl reboot from a terminal results in a coredump (but is not captured by journalctl since it dumps

[03:20:05] <J_Darnley> Is there a point in changing limits.conf to allow different nice levels when you need root or the equivalent capability(?) to set anything below 0?

[03:23:17] <kevr> there are two different types of limits; there's root limits and there's non-root limits.
[03:23:47] <kevr> you can technically configure users to have the same limits at root if you really wanted to, afaik

[03:50:19] <kevr> however, you should keep in mind that this is not really a safe thing to do, because the kernel prefers negative nice values. using a -20 nice will mean that your system is treating your program's nice level the same as the kernel.

[05:34:08] <MacGyver> It's no different from installing arch on one system then hauling it over to another using whatever method you prefer.
[05:34:42] <MacGyver> The usual caveats of reinstalling bootloader for EFI vars, setting up the correct UUIDs and fixing fstab applies of course.
[05:34:47] <MacGyver> But you certainly can do this.

[05:36:34] <MacGyver> Libvirt is just another form of hardware.
[05:37:19] <MacGyver> So yes, you can do this.
[05:37:21] <kevr> indeed, you just need to extract the drive data out of the qcow2 file
[05:37:45] <jcbjoe2021> Ok thanks armin
[05:37:53] <MacGyver> If your intention is to do this you may want to use raw files instead.
[05:38:02] <kevr> ^ true
[05:38:20] <armin> jcbjoe2021: well people here have differing thoughts on what "just" means it seems, but yes, it's absolutely possible as you can see. ;)
[05:38:49] <nothereisnotanam> inst a qcow file just an .img file, whihc is basicaly a raw dump from cpoieng disk to file
[05:39:12] <sheep> qcow also has some other features like copy-on-write, compression, and sparse allocation
[05:39:21] <kevr> no, qcow has more things in it.
[05:39:50] <jcbjoe2021> Ok I want to try arch in a vim first since it's a rolling release and has to be updated all the time. Im currently on Debian but will look into it. Thanks again armin . Brb
[05:39:53] <MacGyver> raw files can be sparse, and if you're installing the system with the express purpose of moving it to real hardware later, handling the qcow is a hassle.

[05:45:42] <nothereisnotanam> 1. make new .img fie, to ssh into vm, make sure you passed that file to qemu to use, then partition and rsync to img file, then outside vm copy img file to disk

[14:56:28] <GuiToris> novns, which is which? https://bpa.st/raw/CX6Q
[14:57:48] <novns> GuiToris, you have the ethernet device ens5f5 and the WLAN device wls1 there
[14:58:43] <GuiToris> net0 = wls1, internet0=ens5f5 ?
[14:58:48] <GuiToris> it's just a guess
[14:59:00] <novns> or vice versa, it depends on your network
[14:59:19] <GuiToris> I use wires

[21:37:41] <Varg> then i said the main reason why i want to use arch instead tumbleweed as a rolling release (cause i want actual software) is that codecs are in the main repo and not shipped by 3rd party repo

[23:46:14] <akspecs> Hey, I'm curious to hear other people's experiences with hibernation with a relatively large amount of ram into a smaller swap partition.
[23:46:42] *** Joins: kevinlc (~kevinalh@2800:200:e8d0:20b:8d4a:ad1:c366:c98a)
[23:47:05] <thrice> well, it'll either fit, or it won't
[23:47:31] <akspecs> say in a scenario with 16 gb of ram -- would it be possible to get away with setting /sys/power/image_size to half ram (ie 8gb swap) and reliably hibernate?f
[23:47:56] <akspecs> thrice: in the event it doesn't fit, is it as though the system shutdown?
[23:48:32] <thrice> hrm, I haven't tried in a bit, but I thought it fails before it tries
[23:48:52] <pulec> recently, every time I restart steam it wants to do 'updates' on like 80 of games ( have hundreds installed)
[23:48:53] *** Quits: brw (~bas@haring.bas.sh) (Quit: The Lounge - https://thelounge.chat)
[23:48:59] <pulec> it's often same games
[23:49:32] <pulec> most just do some kind of verification rather than any real update, so it takes 5s, but some games have big data files which are somehow unpacked and repacked and it can take few minutes
[23:49:33] *** Joins: srv (~cmd@user/srv)
[23:49:42] <akspecs> > it fails before it tries | that sounds reasonable
[23:49:51] <pulec> I should try cleaning up the cache and such and in worst case, fresh .steam
[23:50:01] <thrice> akspecs: give it a try, but I think it says "Not enough space to hibernate" or so

[23:50:21] <MrElendig> pulec: dualbooting with shared steam cache?
[23:50:30] <MrElendig> s/cache/library/
[23:50:35] <pulec> no, they are completely separate
[23:50:40] <pulec> only using ext4 steam libraries
[23:50:50] <akspecs> thrice: thanks; i'll give it a try and report back what i manage
[23:51:01] <pulec> I had that case when sharing steamlibrary, so that's why I separate them MrElendig

[23:51:08] <pulec> on windows I have 'windows only' games anyway
[23:52:08] <pulec> it started it doing with some steamclient update
[23:52:10] <mingdao> teraflops: < teraflops> I think that's your issue, you are using macos font rendering not linux one  <--- thanks, that was it
[23:52:55] <mingdao> https://0x0.st/-hxl.png
[23:53:11] <umaxtu> I've noticed that in Fedora as well. all those itty bitty updates
[23:53:34] <mingdao> Now to find a font that I like as much as Monaco; or a way to use Monaco for text but Segoe UI Symbols for the characters.

[23:54:31] <umaxtu> I just use the nerdfont patched SourceCodePro for everything
[23:54:47] <mingdao> Is that in the Arch repos?
[23:54:55] <thrice> Iosevka for me
[23:55:17] <umaxtu> in the aur anyway
[23:55:34] <mingdao> Need something to display the symbols in that .tmux.conf
[23:55:38] <thrice> https://i.imgur.com/jmbBVMM.png
[23:56:25] <mingdao> This has my preferred font for words https://0x0.st/-hwd.png, but (most of) the symbols are rectangles.
[23:57:06] <grinja> SponiX: update: got it working!
[23:57:10] <mingdao> Still have the arrows displayed by Segoe UI Symbols, but those squares did not with Monaco in the line in urxvt.
