[07:18:35] <Andrew> "TPM couldn't work as intended"
[07:18:39] <Andrew> Sounds spooky.
[07:19:02] <Andrew> (Not considering the fact that Trusuted is turning into Tampered on most vendors)
[07:19:21] <DiffieHellman> TPM is only really good for storing a few yes, but it turns out you can extract the keys from the TPM anyway
[07:20:13] <Andrew> I think I'm good with LUKS
[07:20:40] <Andrew> I actually use a detached header, so it's kind-of-ish a two-factor authentication
[07:21:03] <DiffieHellman> Ehh, not 2FA at all.
[07:21:12] <Andrew> (And it'd be slightly harder to know *for sure* that it's encrypted
[07:21:16] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: Why?
[07:21:27] <Andrew> I mean, I need a physical USB and a password?
[07:21:31] <DiffieHellman> 2FA is a kind of insecure net if you've completely failed and revelead the password.
[07:21:49] <DiffieHellman> A detached header, is a physical seperation of the keys and the password
[07:22:24] <DiffieHellman> I don't bother with detached headers, as it's kinda error prone, plus you can tell if something is encrypted anyway.
[07:23:14] <DiffieHellman> You have a look at the bytes statistically and conclude it's either encrypted or random data (which is why it's reccommended to 0 drives if you're taking them through places that don't like encryption).
[07:23:17] <Andrew> True.
[07:24:03] <Andrew> I'm redoing home security now, and I want some beaglebone blacks instead of the raspberry pis I have
[07:24:27] <Andrew> And I'm too lazy to interface them through a Ethernet cable, just doing i2c communications for now.
[07:24:38] <DiffieHellman> *UTP cable
[07:24:43] <DiffieHellman> Ethernet is a protocol.
[07:25:01] <Andrew> Oh, yes
[07:25:51] <Andrew> I'd say that home-made security might not be great unless if I handle MAC and attack probability distribution correctly, but I'd definitely trust it better tham a off-the-shelf nonfree one

[07:28:18] <DiffieHellman> Off the shelf nonfree is usually comprimised from the start (but in most cases, this won't make a difference to your typical thief).
[07:28:46] <DiffieHellman> It's best to ensure that your doors have proper locks that can't trivially be picked or opened with a credit card.

[08:22:29] <Borley> ^^^ reasonable
[08:25:11] <DiffieHellman> The ME has capabilites that allow you to remotely turn on the computer even when off and do anything, including reinstalling the OS when managed mode is turned on. In the past, a nice bug let you log into management mode with an empty password
[08:26:53] <DiffieHellman> There's also been a OEM issue, where a bunch of computers were mistakingly shipped zero touch provisining turned on, which means you could setup managed mode just with access to the same LAN as the computers we one.

[08:35:00] <jxself> The AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU), formerly known as Fusion, is the marketing term for a series of 64-bit microprocessors from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), designed to act as a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) on a single die.

[08:39:49] <DiffieHellman> tpefreedom: They semi-recently added proprietary firmware for integrated GPU power management
[08:40:54] <tpefreedom> How much does that affect their performance (if you don't use the firmware)?
[08:41:19] <DiffieHellman> I don't know, but probably actually improves it, as it's about power management on laptops
[08:41:50] <DiffieHellman> Intel is known for requiring proprietary firmware for their Wi-Fi cards, so the discrete GPU's are likely to be no different.
[08:42:27] <tpefreedom> IMO, if we want hardware that works with fully free software, then eventually we'll have to create our own chip designs.

[08:44:07] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: Sadly, yes.
[08:44:16] <tpefreedom> Why would we need our own fab?
[08:44:24] <Andrew> If we work on RISC-V or a new architecture, that's less of a problem.

[08:45:22] <tpefreedom> Then various different manufacturers could make the design.
[08:45:28] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: RISC-V is gone for at least 20 years, since someone *cough* SiFive *cough* patented most of the ways to make it fast.

[08:49:35] <Andrew> Could we conteract by using protective patents, i.e., patent licenses get granted to whoever is willing to copyleft changes?
[08:49:41] <GoatAvenger> To my understanding RISC-V did everything lax-permissive, so anyone actually making silicon from their stuff would of course patent it and keep it proprietary and what not
[08:50:14] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: Yes, but you need to build up an impressive pool, so you can slam any aggressors.

[08:50:32] <Andrew> After reading through section 11 of the AGPL a few times more, it seems possible to patent the "idea", not the implementation, but that should work
[08:50:34] <DiffieHellman> GoatAvenger: Yes, this is why RISC-V should have used a copyleft license.
[08:51:14] <Andrew> However, if I'm writing a few lines of trivial code (i.e. a shell script that finds and replaces patterns)

[08:58:18] <GoatAvenger> practically speaking, i mean, say some amd 64 bit designs were freely available and the fsf had enough money to order some chips with those designs and sell them or something

[09:01:30] <DiffieHellman> The AMD64 design is a dumpster fire really. Intel saw that they needed to ditch x86, so they made Itanium, but a AMD managed to pull off a 64-bit extension, Intel had to use that instaed.

The download site shows a few options:  High-speed download (huge green button), regular download (small grey text on a white background).  The guy chooses High-speed download, gets an exe file and runs it, and it launches a "Peer to peer superspeed software downloader",
[09:58:20] <Andrew> which would download and install the software in around an hour.  Then the user discovers ten more programs in C:\ProgramFiles.
