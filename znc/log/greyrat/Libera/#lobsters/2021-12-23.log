[07:59:16] <kline> _rubik, 70 days
[07:59:30] <kline> what were you trying to submit?
[07:59:56] <_rubik> kline: Just an article I had written -- learning go generics with Advent of Code
[08:00:34] <kline> self-posts by new users was the primary motivation behind the new domain filter
[08:00:56] <_rubik> Figured as much
[08:01:30] <_rubik> No worries. If anything I appreciate the opinionated filtering
[08:02:17] <kline> ive no intention, not using go, of posting it, but if you would post it to the website but cant you should at least post it here
[08:02:31] <kline> other people might want to post it, and im certain people would read it
[08:03:32] <_rubik> You raise a good point https://blog.walkergriggs.com/2021/12/15/learning_go_generics_with_aoc/
[08:03:32] <mockturtle> [ Learning Go Generics with Advent of Code ] - blog.walkergriggs.com
[08:04:11] <_rubik> I'm only now starting to take my writing serious. So if anyone wants to comment on style etc, that's fair game too
[08:05:13] <kline> looks like a reasonable post
[08:05:19] <kline> a go person might submit it

[08:12:52] <companion_cube> kline: have you never wanted to use go? you like C, no?
[08:13:32] <kline> i used go when it was new
[08:13:42] <kline> and ive come back to it a few times
[08:13:46] <kline> i dont really like it
[08:13:57] <kline> it doesnt solve any of the things i dont like about C
[08:14:23] <companion_cube> heh, fair enough
[08:14:25] <kline> its got a weak version of CSP, which leaves it feeling lacking compared to erlang of jcsp
[08:14:52] <kline> its basically somehow the worst bits of python and of c
[08:14:58] <companion_cube> :DD
[08:19:05] <_rubik> and yet somehow it's the defacto language for a big chunk of infra eng these days
[08:19:32] <kline> something being popular doesnt mean its good
[08:20:09] <kline> and i dont really like rsc's opinions on language design
[08:20:52] <kline> the rejection of generics, multiple different meaningful comment formats, the empty interface to replace the void pointer, etc
[08:21:22] <kline> these are all bad things that the language designers just arbitrarily decided were good and have required multi-year climbdowns to address
[08:22:01] <_rubik> Ah, agreed. My point was more: it's somehow popular in spite of all it's bad design choices
[08:22:12] <ngoldbaum> the language itself has a lot of issues but being free of a lot of legacy tooling so it can create a portable single binary to distribute is very appealing
[08:22:24] <ngoldbaum> or at least was when go started to get popular
[08:22:32] <kline> ngoldbaum, yeah, and i really liked that cross compilation is easy
[08:22:36] <ngoldbaum> compared with node, python, ruby
[08:23:53] <kline> C cross compilation is hard and it doesnt have to be, mostly because compilers have an unnecessary expectation that they will need to directly integrate with the system
[08:24:09] <mockturtle> Learning Go Generics with Advent of Code [go] (dminkovsky) https://lobste.rs/s/n2raqc
[08:24:18] <kline> so using non-system arches/libcs can be a real pain
[08:24:28] <kline> _rubik, someone posted it as above
[08:25:55] <_rubik> dminkovsky: thanks!
[08:26:02] <_rubik> kline: you were very right
[08:26:41] <dminkovsky> thanks for the post. not a go user but an occasional go reader and have been interested in go generics but hadn't had a chance to check them out
[08:28:03] <dminkovsky> "At this point, I worry that – like any new, shiny tool – developers will look to cram generics wherever they can. Frankly, I think that generics will make the biggest impact in standard libraries – not your application backend."
[08:28:44] <dminkovsky> generics in other languages can be rewarding but unless you're super experienced they often leak pretty quickly for me
[08:29:00] <dminkovsky> but often enough they're a no brainer
[08:29:48] <dminkovsky> Container<X> you know :)

[12:43:23] <perv> The slice and the map are already generic, that's why Go doesn't really need further generics.
[12:43:43] <perv> Though this prohibits nicer to use advanced data structures.
[12:46:36] <perv> Funny, to me Go is C with the bad bits removed.
[12:50:05] <riv> it's also useful in situations where you might have used php or phthon in the past
[12:50:12] <riv> and imo its a huge improvement over those languages
[12:50:31] <riv> despite the lack of generics (which php and python dont have anyway)
[12:51:11] <amazigh> Go has generic in 1.8?
[12:52:09] <amazigh> fwiw, I am still wondering the interest of forbidding dynamic typing.
[12:52:44] <amazigh> gradual / optional typing is good, I mean, except no language took that route except python.
[12:53:18] <riv> i find gradual typing too complex and difficult to understand. I like the simplicity of either just being totally dynamic or totally static
[12:59:13] <amazigh> why is it too complex?
[12:59:39] <riv> i guess its because it tries to be the best of both worlds
[13:00:59] <amazigh> the python tooling for static typing is missing, I think the approach taken by python with signature annotations is not the good one, even if I believe gradual typing is the way.
[13:01:15] <amazigh> I mean before the tooling, the annotation approach is confusing.
[13:01:29] <amazigh> but gradual typing is great.

[13:52:17] <amazigh> the subscription was $20 per month, and it allowed to have one subdomain per branch
[13:53:10] <amazigh> We argued... then somehow, they decided against it, and took a few days to implement it themself with route53 and s3
[13:53:20] <amazigh> a couple of days even.
