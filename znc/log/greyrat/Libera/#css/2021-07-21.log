[04:56:47] <entuland> I've seen a proposal for :dirty and variants such as :changed, but that's old stuff
[04:57:09] <entuland> there is an interesting :user-invalid pseudoclass that could be hacked to achieve what you want, but that sounds like a really ugly hack
[04:57:44] <entuland> and that's also pretty much only supported on firefox anyways :P

[05:07:37] <entuland> oh crabs
[05:07:52] <entuland> nbjoerg, you may be able to detect it with pure CSS
[05:08:14] <entuland> the checked attribute and the :checked pseudoclass are independent
[05:08:32] <FunkyBob> are they?
[05:08:41] <FunkyBob> my idea would be pure css...
[05:08:53] <entuland> yes, but thinking about it again, they're not going to work for what they want in the end
[05:09:00] <FunkyBob> one rule for input[data-initially-set]  and another for input[data-initially-set]:checked
[05:09:22] <entuland> that would work just the same as with checked
[05:09:38] <entuland> but it doesn't help telling whether the checkbox has been toggled twice or never
[05:10:06] <entuland> this for example: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/79cvk1qy/
[05:10:22] <FunkyBob> sorry, hadn't been keeping up with the convo... was only looking for dirty fields
[05:10:37] <entuland> you can detect whether a checkbox was initially checked and whether it's currently checked, but you can't tell whether the user has interacted with it, so yes, you still need JS
[05:10:56] <entuland> yep, dirty detection can be done
[05:11:19] <entuland> but checking if the element has been dirty-ed and un-dirty-ed can't be done without JS
[05:17:00] <entuland> and thinking about it for the third time, not sure I get the usefulness of detecting whether a field has been un-dirty-ed by the user or whether it has never been dirty to begin with

[08:01:30] <Rockwood> o/
[08:01:36] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, hi
[08:04:23] <FunkyBob> hi
[08:05:07] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, any alternative is possible of data-grid ?
[08:05:15] <Rockwood> table
[08:08:07] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, https://codesandbox.io/s/dawn-mountain-n8kym its make my code too much heavy
[08:08:20] <Rockwood> and still its having issue too
[08:15:39] <FunkyBob> heavy in what way?
[08:16:34] <Rockwood> my laptop heating up and its taking lots memory
[08:23:21] <FunkyBob> i've not used the MUI DataTable component
[08:25:28] <Rockwood> any more ref? FunkyBob
[08:25:43] <FunkyBob> ref?
[08:25:53] <FunkyBob> to be able to help, i need to know what y ou need from the table
[08:26:03] <FunkyBob> we use the <Table> components and friends in our MUI site
[08:27:56] <Rockwood> means i have to make own component of table
[08:28:27] <Rockwood> what is MUI?
[08:28:44] <Rockwood> material-ui
[08:30:11] <FunkyBob> yes
[08:30:22] <FunkyBob> MUI provides table components
[08:30:24] <FunkyBob> but again
[08:30:28] <FunkyBob> what features do you need?
[08:31:25] <Rockwood> i need sorting, drag heads, with tooltips
[08:31:48] <FunkyBob> "drag heads" means drad'n'drop column reordering?
[08:31:58] <Rockwood> yes
[08:34:38] <Rockwood> i am trying to find this thing from last few days
[08:35:06] <Rockwood> https://adazzle.github.io/react-data-grid/canary/?path=/story/demos--columns-reordering  but today i got this
[08:35:11] <Rockwood> should i use this?
[08:35:17] <Rockwood> what do you thing?
[08:35:39] <Rockwood> but i am not sure if my data came from DB by fetch then
[08:35:48] <FunkyBob> is all your performance/weight woes happening when using that in-browser build tool?
[08:36:05] <Rockwood> i am using react
[08:36:10] <FunkyBob> well, no shit
[08:36:16] <Rockwood> means?
[08:36:20] <FunkyBob> since Material-UI is all react components
[08:36:36] <FunkyBob> that has nothing to do with how you're building and testing your project
[08:36:59] <FunkyBob> 03:03 < Rockwood> my laptop heating up and its taking lots memory
[08:37:00] <Rockwood> okay
[08:37:04] <FunkyBob> when you say that
[08:37:12] <FunkyBob> are you talking about when develpping in codesandbox?
[08:37:20] <FunkyBob> or building locally?  or running locally? or?
[08:37:29] <FunkyBob> you expect informed answers without giving information
[08:37:30] <Rockwood> locally
[08:37:44] <Rockwood> i am using VM
[08:38:07] <Rockwood> mysql + PHP8 + react
[08:38:07] <FunkyBob> and?
[08:38:17] <FunkyBob> and how are you _building_ your react app?
[08:38:29] <FunkyBob> wow, real glutton for punishment
[08:39:58] <Rockwood> one mint
[08:40:00] <FunkyBob> what do you do to build the browser-runnable JS?
[08:40:10] <Rockwood> laravel's tool
[08:40:18] <Rockwood> 2 sec find the proper name of that
[08:40:24] <FunkyBob> laravel has a JS compile pipeline/
[08:40:30] <FunkyBob> I thought it was a PHP framework
[08:43:29] <Rockwood> npm run watch
[08:43:38] <Rockwood> i am using this command
[08:43:41] <Rockwood> for build
[08:43:58] <Rockwood> yes it is PHP framework
[08:45:32] <FunkyBob> ok, and what is 'watch' in your scripts section of your package.json ?
[08:51:17] <Rockwood> i never chked it
[08:51:27] <Rockwood> 2 sec chking
[08:53:04] <Rockwood> FunkyBob, https://gist.github.com/Cyberiaaxis/2a3e586482c2544a831e3a63c04b93f0
[08:53:09] <Rockwood> yes it is
[08:55:31] <Rockwood> and full is FunkyBob : https://gist.github.com/Cyberiaaxis/2a3e586482c2544a831e3a63c04b93f0
[08:55:42] <FunkyBob> yes, what is?
[08:56:11] <FunkyBob> ok... 'mix' appears to be a laravel wrapper around webpack
[08:56:46] <Rockwood> this is full package json
[08:58:48] <FunkyBob> i see that
[09:01:28] <Rockwood> okay
[09:02:26] <Rockwood> should i use only that material-ui?
[09:02:36] <FunkyBob> huh?
[09:02:51] <Rockwood> i am talking about data gird
[09:02:57] <FunkyBob> material-ui is a toolkit of react components
[09:04:11] <Rockwood> okay
[09:04:30] <FunkyBob> before I was trying to work out the source of your 'weight' problems
[09:04:39] <FunkyBob> was it really the app itself, or built, or dev env, or...
[09:05:04] <FunkyBob> when you make a production build, and use that... is it still resource hungry?
[09:05:51] <Rockwood> means?
[09:07:40] <Rockwood> is it still resource hungry? means
[09:09:20] <FunkyBob> 03:23 < FunkyBob> 03:03 < Rockwood> my laptop heating up and its taking lots memory
[09:09:33] <FunkyBob> i assume when your laptop heats up, it's because the CPU is working hard
[09:09:41] <FunkyBob> CPU time is a resource
[09:09:45] <FunkyBob> memory is a resource
[09:09:55] <FunkyBob> a resource hungry process uses lots of CPU and/or Memory
[09:10:55] <Rockwood> ok
[09:11:02] <Rockwood> yes
[09:11:08] <Rockwood> it is still taking
[09:11:51] <FunkyBob> and it's your browser doing this?
[09:12:53] <Rockwood> when i use VM with Vscode
[09:13:05] <FunkyBob> ...
[09:13:10] <FunkyBob> so the VM is using all the CPU?
[09:13:14] <FunkyBob> or VSCode is?
[09:13:16] <FunkyBob> or your browser?
[09:13:28] <FunkyBob> it's a simple question
[09:16:46] <AMcBain> Didn't you hear? Thin clients are in again! https://github.com/features/codespaces
[09:17:39] <FunkyBob> :P
[09:17:44] <AMcBain> I never did find out if that one laptop I had could have cooked an egg. I ended up buying a fan pad for it so it wouldn't crash when doing renders.
[09:18:21] <AMcBain> Thankfully most laptops now are better than that was.
[09:18:35] <FunkyBob> heh
[09:18:58] <FunkyBob> when I was first moved to this front-end team, my laptop was ... bleh... a 2C4T i7
[09:19:21] <Rockwood> 2 sec chking
[09:19:28] <FunkyBob> it took a looong time to do the initial build
[09:19:36] <Rockwood> no
[09:19:45] <Rockwood> its building faster
[09:20:07] <FunkyBob> ,,,
[09:20:25] <FunkyBob> not sure how that answers my question
[09:20:42] <Rockwood> just my laptop heats too much when i open the VM + VScode with bowser
[09:20:55] <Rockwood> together
[09:21:15] <Rockwood> on data-grid
[09:21:21] <Rockwood> script on screen
[09:21:35] <Rockwood> at time locally
[09:22:38] <AMcBain> FunkyBob, hoping when I eventually I upgrade to a newer laptop there's a rockin' Ryzen I can get. There are some now.
[09:22:53] <FunkyBob> AMcBain: I got a r5-4000 series now
[09:22:59] <AMcBain> Nice :)
[09:23:00] <FunkyBob> 6 physical cores... such a big difference
[09:23:22] <FunkyBob> oddly, before this I was on the data pipeline team... and there we'd have _hugely_ parallel jobs to run
[09:25:12] <FunkyBob> of course now, since this is AMD, the maths turns out subtly different so I can't use it for full pipeline tests anyway
[09:25:28] <AMcBain> Whaa? That sounds weird.
[09:25:44] <FunkyBob> weird, by reliably reproducable
[09:26:17] <FunkyBob> early on i configured a AWS pool of AMD boxen, since they were bigger and cheaper...
[09:26:28] <FunkyBob> and, yeah... results differed
[09:27:08] <AMcBain> They should be testing these things quite well, I wouldn't immediately assume AMD there, but I dunno.
[09:27:21] <AMcBain> Nobody wants to be Intel with the math error again.
[09:27:26] <FunkyBob> heh
[09:27:43] <FunkyBob> yeah, well... run it on any of numerous intel machines.... consistent results
[09:27:52] <FunkyBob> run it on AMD, consistent but differentresults
[09:28:32] <FunkyBob> I got some hand wavey response about huge iteration counts and tiny variances in rounding / trig functions, etc...
[09:30:55] <AMcBain> I mean I suppose it's possible, if there's floating point involved or whatever.
[09:31:05] <FunkyBob> yah
[09:31:23] <FunkyBob> I remember someone once telling me ... some people are more upset by slow maths than inaccurate maths, and thus we have floats :P
[09:33:16] <AMcBain> Hey, yeah, where's my bio neural gel packs that do human-level fuzzy math to get fast answers to complicated stuff that's close to right.
[09:33:38] <FunkyBob> i remember sun doing some interseting stuff with range math
[09:33:52] <FunkyBob> but, arbitrary precision calculations are a thing
[09:33:57] <AMcBain> Yeah
[09:36:47] <Rockwood> what https://codesandbox.io/s/dawn-mountain-n8kym kind of issue in it?
[09:36:52] <Rockwood> only width
[09:39:54] <Rockwood> its cashing

[17:22:35] <hassoon> rannnn8888: take the necessary html from your devtools, and create us a working example
[17:28:36] <rannnn8888> hassoon It looks worse here: D in the original it's like in the picture https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/338
[17:29:07] <entuland> rannnn8888, tables' default behavior is to grow depending on their contents already, unless their dimensions are limited - when that happens, you'll get the wrapping to solve the lack of space
[17:29:28] <entuland> the overflowing you are getting in the last link is due to the single very long word that can't be split / wrapped, that's a different thing
[17:29:41] <entuland> something has to give somewhere, you have to decide where
[17:30:35] <entuland> if there isn't enough room for the table to grow without wrapping, the only thing you can do is let the table itself grow outside of its own container
[17:30:46] <entuland> and you'll get either clipping or horizontal scrolling
[17:31:20] <rannnn8888> entuland ah ok now its like in my website,but i dont can its make autu size to cell by the text inside ? https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/339
[17:31:35] <rannnn8888> example the all the 250 no need its take all this size
[17:32:10] <hassoon> rannnn8888: don't use django syntax in the fiddle, use your devtools to take up the produced html and css code(s)
[17:34:11] <entuland> the main problem you have there is the fixed layout and the header of the table in a separated table, makes no real sense and complicates thing
[17:34:12] <entuland> s
[17:34:52] <rannnn8888> entuland yep i try change the table-layout: auto;
[17:35:07] <rannnn8888> but when i cahnge the th no fix to the td
[17:35:16] <entuland> you also need to put thead within the same table as tbody
[17:35:39] <entuland> https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/340
[17:36:42] <rannnn8888> https://ibb.co/ypRWzHF
[17:36:46] <rannnn8888> example
[17:37:05] <entuland> example of what exactly?
[17:37:42] <rannnn8888> table-layout: auto;
[17:38:02] <entuland> yes, you've "fixed" the body but the header doesn't line up anymore
[17:39:10] <entuland> also, auto is the default, so you just need to remove the table-layout declaration
[17:39:59] <entuland> in the end it's up to you to find the compromise you like better, but the lack of alignment between head and body is just plain wrong with tables
[17:41:20] <entuland> if I had to fix it, I'd use just a min-width on TDs to avoid the table clumping together too much (last declaration in the CSS) https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/341
[17:41:48] <entuland> (along with putting head and body in the same table to make sure they line up)

[20:39:38] <michigan> entuland: thanks will try
[20:41:07] <entuland> there are some objective things about your images that by some design guidelines could be improved, to be honest
[20:41:34] <entuland> one is that the logos could take advantage of being recognizable at smaller resolutions
[20:41:47] <entuland> the other is about color contrast

[20:42:27] <michigan> sorry wrong link 4) https://i.postimg.cc/6qbvpZ9N/lezrollconcept04.png
[20:42:30] <entuland> another yet is the pick of the comic sans, which you could probably avoid, just for the fact that's been abused and easily gives bad vibes to people
[20:43:15] <entuland> all the remarks still apply to the latest image

[21:34:49] <kevindank> Hello on https://harrisonpropertiesltd.com/type-category/property-for-sale/ the sold tag is not displaying over the top the images except for the top one.
[21:34:58] <kevindank> Not sure why, can anyone point that out?  I know the rest of the site is a mess.
[21:36:48] <entuland> kevindank, at a glance, the "nesting" level of those two differently behaving "sold" banners looks different
[21:37:17] <kevindank> i see one has a negative left setting, but im not sure why it only changes for some but not all
[21:37:33] <kevindank> setting left to 0 on  html body.term-77 article .text .item.sale.green fixes for some but not all.
[21:38:06] <entuland> https://i.imgur.com/SWEWmQo.png
[21:38:14] <entuland> the problem seems to be the surrounding markup
[21:38:49] <entuland> notice how the working one (the second) is within a way deeper nested set of markup
[21:39:16] <entuland> are you actually using the facilities provided by WP or are you copypasting some produced markup?

[21:58:11] <aruns> Hi, am I unable to use :not() with a descendant combinator?
[21:58:18] <aruns> e.g. :not(.modal) .button
[21:58:46] <aruns> So only apply styles to any element with .button if none of its parents have the class .modal?

[22:03:08] *** Joins: Akimb (~Akimb@86.100.13.100)
[22:03:37] <entuland> the :not(.someclass) applies only to the element you're applying the :not() to
[22:04:01] <entuland> same for :not(sometagname)
[22:04:19] <kevindank> entuland: so i figured out that the other pages all have content inside and it looks like it is a min height type issue somewhere
[22:04:30] <kevindank> if i add text inside instead of just the word sold the sold banner positions correctly.
[22:04:55] <entuland> nice
[22:05:06] <entuland> so all of those boxes are generated by WP, no manual messing with the markup?
[22:07:47] <kevindank> correct,
[22:07:50] <entuland> good
[22:08:09] <entuland> aruns, I think I see where the problem is there - you need a more specific selector to match that case
[22:08:58] <entuland> as that selector would match _any_ other ancestor due to the descendant combinator, which could match at any level
[22:10:40] <entuland> aruns: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/wpsg1kbz/
[22:11:10] <entuland> notice how the second rule only works because of the child combinator instead of the descendant combinator
[22:11:48] <entuland> the first rule matches the first P both because of the plain <div> surrounding it and because of both BODY and HTML, which is also the reason why it matches the last P
[22:12:46] <entuland> notice the different behavior here: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/wpsg1kbz/1/
[22:13:48] <entuland> by adding body to the selectors, I'm "fixing" the second and third Ps, but the first one still fails due to the additional DIV in the tree
[22:14:08] <entuland> you just need to find a "stronger" selector to match your case
