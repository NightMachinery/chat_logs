[03:39:24] <il> is it possible to have 'search bookmarks'
[03:48:59] <emanuele6> ?
[03:49:52] <emanuele6> you can search your bookmarks using writing :open in the prompt and using the completion
[03:49:57] <emanuele6> or do you mean something else?
[03:50:25] <emanuele6> s/using //
[03:53:05] <il> emanuele6, yes, I mean something else. In firefox you can right click on a search input text box and choose to 'Add a keyword for this search'. Then, whatever you prefix with that keyword gets automatically searched from there.
[03:53:17] <il> It's kind of like DDG !bangs, but local
[03:53:30] <Lord> yes you can do this in qutebrowser
[03:53:36] <emanuele6> you can add those, yes
[03:53:48] <il> how's it done
[03:53:59] <il> what are they called
[03:54:12] <Lord> in your qutebrowser.conf
[03:54:23] <Lord> you have a [searchengines] section
[03:55:05] <emanuele6> qutebrowser.conf? lmao
[03:55:45] <emanuele6> that's qutebrowser 1
[03:56:06] <il> Alright so
[03:56:28] <il> How is it done?
[03:56:40] <emanuele6> il: url.searchengines
[03:56:52] <il> emanuele6, is that a setting
[03:57:01] <emanuele6> yes, a dictionary-type setting
[03:57:26] <il> Very well
[03:57:42] <emanuele6> :config-dict-add url.searchengines !wen https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search={}
[03:57:47] <emanuele6> example ^
[03:59:34] <emanuele6> if you are configuring from python, you would use
[03:59:38] <emanuele6>    c.url.searchengines['!wen'] = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search={}'
[04:00:00] <il> emanuele6, if I fuck up, I can just use :config-dict-remove?
[04:00:21] <emanuele6> yep,   :config-dict-remove url.searchengines !wen   in this case
[04:00:38] <il> good, good
[04:00:45] <emanuele6> you will see your search engines in `:open' 's completion 
[04:00:54] <emanuele6> above bookmarks

[04:03:10] <il> Damn, thanks for helping out
[04:03:11] <emanuele6> don't use qutebrowser.conf unless you are running qutebrower 0.x.x
[04:03:13] <il> very convenient
[04:03:20] <il> I'm running 2.5.0
[04:03:23] <emanuele6> yeah, lol
[04:03:23] <il> whatever the newest one is
[04:03:44] <emanuele6> qutebrowser hasn't used the  qutebrowser.conf  system since 2017
[04:04:12] <il> I see
[04:04:45] <il> emanuele6, is it normal for 'search engines' tab to collapse as soon as you type anything further
[04:04:59] <il> after the keyword
[04:05:32] <emanuele6> what do you mean?
[04:05:54] <emanuele6> they are the first option of tab completion if you have not typed anything, yes
[04:06:29] <emanuele6> pressing tab in the statusbar will select the first option (pressing tab again, will select the next option)
[04:06:34] <il> yes
[04:06:40] <il> let me take a screenshot
[04:08:47] <il> emanuele6, this is the menu/whatever it's called without anything typed https://0x0.st/oqhC.png
[04:09:16] <il> emanuele6, this is when I use the search keyword https://0x0.st/oqFr.png
[04:09:31] <il> the search engines tab/submenu/whatever it'd be called collapses
[04:10:19] <emanuele6> it's because it only matches the text
[04:10:39] <il> So it's the intended behavior, alright
[04:11:04] <il> Thanks for helping out, again
[04:11:10] <il> I'd have never dug that out myself
[04:11:11] <emanuele6> "x operator"  is not part of  "x" nor "https://1337x.to/search/{}/1"
[04:11:17] <emanuele6> so it does not match
[04:11:22] <il> Yes, I understand
[04:11:44] <il> And yes, I download media illegally, sue me
[04:11:49] <il> jk, don't sue me
[04:12:27] <emanuele6> (. ) (. )
[04:13:03] <il> one more question
[04:13:16] <il> the other day I accidentally moved tabs with some key combo and I haven't figured out what it was
[04:13:18] <il> how to move tabs
[04:13:50] <emanuele6> if you type   :tab-move  you will see what it is bound to
[04:13:58] <emanuele6> gm
[04:13:59] <il> yes, I just figured that out
[04:14:04] <il> figuring things out as I go
[04:14:12] <il> g{num}m 
[04:14:18] <emanuele6> e.g.  3gm  moves to the third tab
[04:14:27] <il> or that
[04:14:27] <emanuele6> by the way
[04:14:34] <Lord> Sorry i grepped *.conf on qute's directory. I totally forgot it was in python now :-\
[04:14:41] <emanuele6> scrot -d 3 - | curl -Ffile=@- 0x0.st
[04:14:45] <il> yes
[04:14:51] <il> oh, you shortened it
[04:14:56] <il> no, let me be inefficient
[04:15:01] <emanuele6> i removed the need for the temp file
[04:15:07] <il> how does it work
[04:15:17] <emanuele6> it prints the raw image data to stdout
[04:15:28] <il> is that what an empty flag does for scrot?
[04:15:33] <emanuele6> and the it curl uploads stdin (which is the output of scrot)
[04:15:59] <emanuele6> -   usually mean "output to stdout" or "input from stdin" in unix tools
[04:16:11] <il> let's test it out
[04:16:14] <il> I use fish shell on this computer
[04:16:28] <emanuele6> the shell doesn't matter
[04:16:35] <emanuele6> curl and scrot are external commands
[04:17:10] <il> it doesn't work
[04:17:39] <emanuele6> https://0x0.st/oqFz.png
[04:17:41] <emanuele6> works for me
[04:18:17] <emanuele6> also in fish http://0x0.st/oqFi.png
[04:18:25] <il> I get this http://0x0.st/-k.txt
[04:19:03] <emanuele6> can you copy paste the command you ran?
[04:19:17] <il> it's a copy paste of what you wrote
[04:19:22] <emanuele6> and send it here
[04:19:24] <il> scrot -d 3 - | curl -Ffile=@- 0x0.st
[04:19:24] <emanuele6> i mean the command
[04:20:01] <emanuele6> that's odd, it should work, but Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[04:21:15] <il> https://0x0.st/oqFH.png
[04:22:06] <il> I'll try it on ksh tomorrow if I remember
[04:23:13] <emanuele6> -k.txt usually means scrot didn't output anything
[04:23:40] <il> what's your scrot -v
[04:24:01] <emanuele6> 1.7
[04:25:16] <emanuele6> my package manager says it's a 5 month old version
[04:25:39] <il> Mine is 1.5, so that might have something to do with it

[19:58:13] <wasamasa> now, it would be great if the downloader logic in general would do this

[20:07:54] <The-Compiler> wasamasa: it does that for normal downloads, just not for temporary files. I suppose for temporary files a prompt isn't needed, but it should indeed keep the original name and just increment a counter if needed.

IIRC, somebody told me that there was an upstream problem making it difficult to implement session.lazy_restore If my recollection is correct, is there an issue (ideally in the Qutebrowser github) that I can subscribe to?
