[00:00:15] <krux02> the "100" wasn't meant to be taken literal.
[00:00:42] <BaronVladimirHar> Opening "100" tabs is difficult in Firefox even with 16 GB of RAM.
[00:01:04] <krux02> BaronVladimirHar, but yes you address the correct problem
[00:01:10] <BaronVladimirHar> But Vivaldi doesn't break a sweat, and even GNOME Web only uses about half the RAM Firefox does, despite having every tab process isolated from each other.
[00:01:22] <krux02> I don't want firefox to open too many tabs, because that would waste my RAM
[00:01:50] <BaronVladimirHar> Then close some or find a browser that manages memory allocation properly. :)
[00:02:18] <BaronVladimirHar> Firefox's MemShrink project obviously petered out.
[00:02:24] <BaronVladimirHar> It started growing and growing and growing again.
[00:02:35] <krux02> currently I currently only have 8 GB or ram, so I have to use it conservatively
[00:02:50] <BaronVladimirHar> Under a true split-process model, when you close that tab, you get that memory back soon.
[00:02:55] <krux02> BaronVladimirHar, what are you talking about?
[00:03:16] <BaronVladimirHar> Under Firefox's it shoved everything into like maybe 8 processes for web content, and leaked memory is not necessarily returned properly.
[00:03:27] <BaronVladimirHar> Because there's no way for you to easily tell which tabs belong to what process.
[00:03:44] <krux02> BaronVladimirHar, are you trolling me?
[00:03:54] <BaronVladimirHar> So you give up and close the entire browser, like it's 2005 all over again.

[00:04:29] <BaronVladimirHar> krux02: I suppose you could try papering over the problem with zram.
[00:05:19] <krux02> ???
[00:05:20] <BaronVladimirHar> Oddly enough, this is how Google gets away with stripping memory down to a bare minimum on Chrome devices.
[00:05:33] <BaronVladimirHar> So if you convert any of them to a proper operating system, you need to use zram there as well.
[00:05:45] <krux02> I honestly have no idea why you are suggesting me this, it completely misses my problem
[00:06:38] <BaronVladimirHar> I'm not sure how Firefox is opening all of these tabs unless you're requesting it to open more and more things.
[00:08:35] <mefistofeles> krux02: it will only open 1 new window/stuff, because you don't really want other things to be 
[00:08:38] <mefistofeles> replaced
[00:09:11] <mefistofeles> krux02: hmm but yeah, I don't think that's what you want
[00:09:37] <krux02> I currently use the command line api to open a link in firefox
[00:09:50] <krux02> firefox 'www.google.com'
[00:10:27] <krux02> but when I call that 100 times, I have 100 tabs open.
[00:10:42] <krux02> but I want it to have only 1 tab and no other windows.
[00:11:34] <krux02> I wan.t find a flag that specifies '-no-now-tab' or something
[00:11:47] <krux02> I can only find a flag to open a new window, which is also not what I want.
[00:12:08] <krux02> if the command line API is not the correct API to do thins, what is the corretc api to do this?
[00:13:07] <krux02> what does this problem have to do with `zram`?
[00:13:53] <BaronVladimirHar> Firefox assumes you want a new tab.
[00:14:02] <BaronVladimirHar> I think there's also one for new window, unless they removed it.
[00:14:20] <krux02> BaronVladimirHar, I want neither
[00:14:27] <krux02> I wan't reuse tab
[00:14:38] <krux02> so how can I do that?
[00:15:20] <mefistofeles> krux02: yeah, I'd think you need an extension for that. I guess for safety reasons they don't expose some API to let external apps/parties find out if tabs are opened and such, I'd presume.
[00:17:03] <krux02> mefistofeles, why does safety always need to be the asshole to blame when we can't have nice things?
[00:18:05] <Zelouille> BaronVladimirHar: "there's no way for you to easily tell which tabs belong to what process." -> about:processes does it.
[00:18:09] <mefistofeles> krux02: haha, well... your use case is weird, I guess you could also ask for the feature, maybe there's something already there for it
[00:23:56] <krux02> I just found out about 'firefox --marionette` it might be able to do what I want.
[00:24:06] <krux02> but it is 100 times more complicated

[03:48:22] <BaronVladimirHar> Well, the Firefox flatpak is pretty busted, as far as basic usability goes, anyway.
[03:48:45] <BaronVladimirHar> This sandbox disease makes it so you can't even drag and drop files on a program without messing around with flatseal.
[03:49:57] <BaronVladimirHar> There's really no way to effectively sandbox a program that's meant to be used like this.
[03:50:13] <BaronVladimirHar> For instance, the user probably expects to have full access to their home folder.
[03:50:49] <BaronVladimirHar> But if you give Firefox that, then conceivably something could drop malware there, make it executable, then run it, and if there's a privilege escalation issue in the OS, use that.
[03:51:19] <BaronVladimirHar> But Firefox isn't really interested in security.
[03:52:06] <BaronVladimirHar> I booted up a Macbook with Mac OS 10.6 on it and both Firefox and Chrome were screaming that they didn't support that anymore, then I tried to go looking, and 10.6 was the latest Mac OS that ran on that thing.
[03:53:01] <BaronVladimirHar> There's no reason why new software shouldn't build on older Macs. It's just easier for Mozilla and Google to give up and help Apple push these older computers over the edge.

[05:10:42] <BaronVladimirHar> Mac and Windows aren't like GNU/Linux and the BSDs.
[05:11:21] <BaronVladimirHar> With a proper OS, there's no "drop dead date" on your computer just because you haven't bought another one and the OEM wants to kick your ass.
[05:12:02] <BaronVladimirHar> But with Windows and Mac, there is a drop dead date. It's whenever they claim your computer won't work anymore.
[05:12:20] <BaronVladimirHar> Perhaps nothing points that out better than what happened to that Macbook.
[05:12:50] <BaronVladimirHar> First, Apple stopped updating it even though it should have been compatible with (probably) 3-4 more versions, or more, of OS X.
[05:13:28] <BaronVladimirHar> Then Mozilla and Google helped Apple with this charade by no longer updating their browsers, even though they really required little or nothing that OS X 10.6 didn't provide for a very long time.

[15:57:30] <BaronVladimirHar> <ede> "Baron Vladimir Harkonnen: you'..." <- The actual 386? Not supported since sometime last year, I think.
[15:57:40] *** Quits: gareppa (~gareppa@user/gareppa) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:57:50] <BaronVladimirHar> But Windows Vista Service Pack 11 makes Core i7s from three years ago "obsolete".
[15:58:24] <BaronVladimirHar> Linux tends to drop things about 20 or 30 years later, when nobody out there has the actual hardware to verify that it even works.
[15:58:50] <BaronVladimirHar> Plus, the last devices with embedded 386 processors were from the early 2000s, and they don't really need upgrades anyway.
[16:00:02] <BaronVladimirHar> The closest you'll get to those today are the Vortex86, and those are basically i686 without CMOV.
[16:00:18] <BaronVladimirHar> In practice, you should still be able to run i586 stuff on those.
[16:01:23] <BaronVladimirHar> It'll be a while before 32-bit x86 is entirely out of the Linux world, and why remove something that's not causing a big maintenance burden for no reason?
[16:01:55] <BaronVladimirHar> Microsoft got rid of all but a few years worth of CPUs and they still got the processor bug disasters on AMD Ryzen where they're very slow on Windows Vista Service Pack 11.
[16:02:40] <BaronVladimirHar> They've had so many bugs so far. One of them even showed the Windows 10 taskbar. They never remove crap from Windows. It just accumulates.
[16:02:45] <BaronVladimirHar> It's the sum of all crap.
[16:03:33] <BaronVladimirHar> In any event, we're not talking about deprecating a processor from 1987.
[16:03:45] <BaronVladimirHar> Microsoft and Apple don't support things from 3-4 years ago.
[16:04:00] *** Quits: gryffus (~gryffus@81.19.2.214) (Quit: Leaving...)
[16:04:26] <BaronVladimirHar> Some users figure out how to bypass the TPM check, and it may keep working for a while, and it might not.
[16:04:37] <BaronVladimirHar> The reason it's a requirement is more "optics".
[16:05:23] <BaronVladimirHar> Microsoft can't secure its own networks and its own products, so TPM is a diversion from that. From things like the Microsoft 365 disaster last March, or Solarwinds.
[16:05:41] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla is in deep shit because it no longer considers Microsoft competition.
[16:06:06] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla moved everything over to stuff like Slack, which doesn't pretend at being open source, and GitHub, which is a platform for censorship and DMCA abuse.
[16:06:22] <BaronVladimirHar> They're a thrall of Microsoft and Google.
[16:06:38] <BaronVladimirHar> They give out free advertising for Apple's most malicious and restrictive platform yet. It's just sad.
[16:07:22] <BaronVladimirHar> <Timvde> "Baron Vladimir Harkonnen: the..." <- Wrong.
[16:07:41] <BaronVladimirHar> I could still load Linux on a Mac with a Core 2 Duo.
[16:07:48] <BaronVladimirHar> Current releases too.
[16:08:08] <BaronVladimirHar> Then it could run Chrome again.
[16:08:37] <BaronVladimirHar> The problem is artificial obsolescence. If it worked forever, they'd never sell the current model until your hardware physically broke down 10-15 years later.
[16:09:11] <BaronVladimirHar> So Apple basically only supports you for a few years and then new software stops working, and then the computer is a brick unless you put Linux on it somehow.
[16:10:05] <BaronVladimirHar> The truth is that nothing terribly important changes year to year, and you pretty much have to wait at least 5 years before buying a new laptop starts to look attractive from the "It's really faster." angle.
[16:10:41] <BaronVladimirHar> In Apple's case, they have this schizo design process, like when they declared you didn't need all these ports and then the Macbook turned into a Christmas Tree of dongles, like their phone.
[16:11:14] <BaronVladimirHar> A very elegant rat's nest! Some would say the best!
[16:15:51] <JanC> BaronVladimirHar: there is at least one former Soviet Union silicon manufacturer that still sells 8086, 8088, 80186, 80286 & IIRC also i386 compatible CPUs (although those might be leftover stock, so no big volume sales...)
[16:16:23] <BaronVladimirHar> FreeDOS would still work.
[16:16:35] <BaronVladimirHar> The US government still uses that in some places.
[16:16:38] <JanC> I presume they sell to companies that still use those for industrial processes

[16:49:03] <Timvde> BaronVladimirHar: you say I'm wrong by giving an example that's irrelevant to my example? :P
[16:51:13] <BaronVladimirHar> "Linux is basically like Windows 11 because Linux dropped support for a 1987 processor. So that's basically like Windows 11 dropping support for everything pre-2018 and then having severe task scheduler bugs on Ryzen! Herp!"
[16:51:49] <BaronVladimirHar> My point is if something is as old as me, it should probably be dropped.
[16:52:12] <BaronVladimirHar> But Microsoft is declaring that $500 processors from 3 years ago are unsupported (by them).
[16:52:38] <BaronVladimirHar> Good riddance anyway. Maybe enough people laugh at them and quit using their nutty operating system.
[16:53:19] <BaronVladimirHar> Also, Bitlocker is a joke.
[16:53:35] <BaronVladimirHar> You'll lose your data to that 100,000 times over before you'll lose a laptop.

[17:28:13] <BaronVladimirHar> Because Firefox is a piece of crap that is increasingly incompatible with the web, while they stuff it with malware.

[17:30:37] <ede> Xterm.js is a front-end component written in TypeScript... what does this mean for firefox? does some JS have to break it down first or would it run natively?

[17:32:13] <ede> classic was when i save the same ressource repeatadly using a name like DATE_TIME then the _ would appear after all the digits
[17:32:21] <BaronVladimirHar> Half the time, you can use the latest build of Firefox and the site doesn't care if it breaks.
[17:32:51] <ede> ofc i start typing before the save dialog even is complete, it still shouldn't reorder the input stream.
[17:32:59] <BaronVladimirHar> Facebook locked out Firefox from Messenger calls for a year and a half, and even though lying about the user agent made it work, Firefox "reached out" to Facebook and let them spend 18 months recommending that people switch to Chrome.

[17:34:06] <BaronVladimirHar> Any company in Firefox's predicament who had one of the top sites on the internet breaking something they were compatible with and then recommending their competitor, would have fixed it right away. If the people in charge actually cared.

[18:19:39] <ede> how is something like https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/ supposed to work in the browser?
[18:19:52] <ede> i really don't want to install npm just to find it out
[18:20:17] <ede> i see the css linked in the example, but not the js.
[18:21:19] <ede> also, terminal in the browser doeasn't really sound like a replacement for real terminals which are installed on the machine.

[20:13:50] <RoChess> anybody in here with experience in writing a FireFox extension that intercepts HTTP requests and can convert a popup into loading the HTML5 code inside the extension?
[20:18:25] <phy1729> intercepting requests is pretty easy https://github.com/phy1729/deurchin/blob/master/deurchin.js for the rest the docs are at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions
[20:18:54] <phy1729> the JavaScript APIs section in the sidebar is the API reference
[20:20:07] <RoChess> phy1729, MDN has nice API info indeed, but i was hoping for an easy hello-world example to download and play with, versus following instructions that expect you to already have written a functional extension
[20:20:38] <RoChess> phy1729, i rather pay somebody that has done that to help me out, commercial project so my boss can pay for it instead of wasting my time heheh
[20:21:18] <phy1729> Don't think this is the right forum to find that
[20:21:53] <RoChess> ohh i tried the official channels like guru, but wasted a whole week dealing with ppl who say they can, but i lost faith in them

[20:26:46] <RoChess> it feels like it would take 1-2 week for me to study the documentation and understand how to make my own browser extensions, but i need to have a faster start... kinda dissapointed MDN doesn't offer downloadable hello-world examples, unless i am blind and overlooking them
[20:27:43] <phy1729> like this page? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension
[20:28:31] <RoChess> lol, blind indeed
[20:29:53] <RoChess> i see on the github page that addons.mozilla.org denies extensions to inject JS code, is that CORS or COBS that stops that?

[23:29:40] <BaronVladimirHar> Then their new Suggest spyware seems to have caused this already.
[23:29:44] <BaronVladimirHar> That was fast.
[23:30:56] <BaronVladimirHar> <RoChess> "phy1729, MDN has nice API info..." <- Yeah, it got bailed out by Microsoft money, and Google.
[23:31:09] <BaronVladimirHar> "How do we sleep? On a pile of dirty cash!"
[23:31:59] <BaronVladimirHar> Microsoft and Google aren't seen as the enemy at Mozilla.
[23:32:04] <RoChess> BaronVladimirHar, yeah it can get tricky
[23:32:15] <BaronVladimirHar> They have no intention of competing. You can't when you need their money.
[23:32:38] <BaronVladimirHar> Google has an incentive to prop up Mozilla as Antitrust insurance.
[23:33:21] <BaronVladimirHar> Mozilla technically could push back against Google's malicious APIs and stuff, at least to the extent that Webkit does.
[23:33:28] <BaronVladimirHar> But they just blindly copy them, because they're paid to.
