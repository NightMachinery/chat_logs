[00:00:30] <PublicWiFi> oops
[00:00:33] <PublicWiFi> killed my graylog server
[00:00:40] <yuken> Haise0, semi-auto AKs are cheap, yeah. That's not surprising.
[00:00:40] <PublicWiFi> guess itll just stay dead this weekend
[00:00:46] <yuken> $650-1000 depending on manufacturer.
[00:00:47] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> guess its deadlog
[00:01:05] <Haise0> yuken: you could in theory mod them to be full auto or thats not a thing ?
[00:01:15] <Hunterkll> Haise0: well, you could
[00:01:20] <Hunterkll> absoultely you techni9cally could 
[00:01:29] <Haise0> but it would violate laws ?
[00:01:30] <Hunterkll> you'll also get 10-20 years in prison too
[00:01:35] <Haise0> ah
[00:01:36] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> Hunterkll: wiating on ingram to get back with me XD
[00:01:37] <Haise0> yeah
[00:01:58] <shibboleth> also, the m4/16/ar15 use 5.56x45mm ammo iirc. and getting a proper m4/16 might prove hard. you'll find plenty of full-auto german G3 variants though (prev in use by... greece, iran, germany, finland etc) 7.62/51mm gives you muuuch more stopping power
[00:02:07] <shibboleth> hand-cannons by comparison
[00:02:08] <yuken> Haise0, well sure, it's easy.
[00:02:15] <yuken> Haise0, it takes like 15 minutes to turn an AR-15 into full auto, for example.
[00:02:21] <yuken> A drill, a steady hand, and a coathanger.
[00:02:27] <Haise0> yuken: o_o wow
[00:02:40] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> but sooooooooo illegal
[00:02:46] <yuken> Actually, you don't even need a drill, I think that coathanger mod doesn't need any additional holes.
[00:02:50] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> I'll pay my $200 thanks
[00:02:50] <yuken> The hole is just for a proper full-auto sear.

[00:05:53] <yuken> shibboleth, PS90 is the civilian P90, with a 16" barrel.

[00:08:27] <yuken> The barrel length regulations are bullshit anyway, shibboleth.
[00:08:31] <Hunterkll> yuken: but even so, open bolt isn't necessarily illegal
[00:08:35] <yuken> They're from the 30s with an attempt to ban handguns.
[00:08:38] <Hunterkll> it's basically a myth
[00:08:38] <yuken> Hunterkll, I'm aware.

[00:08:48] <Hunterkll> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HI9Y2kl9Muo
[00:09:01] <yuken> It's illegal to have a firearm which can be readily restored to full auto with no modifications other than removing parts.
[00:09:05] <yuken> And most open bolt magazine guns are that.
[00:11:12] <shibboleth> yeah, my point was that the p90 is... well, marketing it for civilian use would be "tongue in cheek"
[00:11:29] <shibboleth> but sure, a civ version with a longer barrel, sure you might be able to fly that under the radar
[00:11:44] <shibboleth> "clean coal"
[00:11:48] <shibboleth> "civilian p90"
[00:11:57] <Hunterkll> er
[00:12:03] <Hunterkll> its literally made so that p90 fans can have one
[00:12:06] <yuken> shibboleth, I mean, this is perfectly legal for a civilian to own with no permits or licenses. https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gunsamerica.com%2Fuserimages%2F2006%2F949238072%2Fwm_14589773.jpg&f=1&nofb=1
[00:12:07] <Hunterkll> even if its not functionally the same
[00:12:08] <Hunterkll> lol

[00:12:13] <yuken> And about the same size.

[00:35:19] <bloody> so you've been to cali eh?
[00:35:23] <TurkeyGibby> !flyfact
[00:35:23] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: On average, the life cycle of a house fly only lasts for around 30 days, which means they don’t live for long at all.However, in their short lifetime, they manage to accomplish quite a lot. House flies can lay up to 500 eggs in their lifetime which are usually in batches of around 75 to 150. So, although they don’t live long, an infestation can quickly arise through new generations.

[19:28:24] <catbeard> The neat thing about ZFS on our platform is that we only give you a certain amount of disk but if you exceed it then you don't get the no space left on device error we just charge you overage and it keeps working
[19:29:06] <catbeard> WP offload media plugin is really nice for that if you have S3 buckets
[19:29:26] <teh_f4ll3n> our WP installs are literally <100MB each
[19:29:47] <catbeard> Just the files or the database too
[19:30:13] <teh_f4ll3n> DB is on a separate mysql 8 vm :)
[19:30:30] <teh_f4ll3n> and it's not large

[19:30:41] <catbeard> ?
[19:31:09] <teh_f4ll3n> yes, I just created a new VM, then plugged it into plesk and migrated all DB's to that

[19:32:14] <teh_f4ll3n> there's a standby backup with nightly sync on a different host

[19:34:24] <teh_f4ll3n> the sites are the final stop
[19:35:14] <teh_f4ll3n> so losing 1 day's worth of web DB is literally a non-issue, since you just click "sync" to fetch the data again
[19:35:20] <teh_f4ll3n> and you're all up to date
[19:35:43] <catbeard> neat
