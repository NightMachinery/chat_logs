[03:10:08] <dD__> actually, just a little clearer: if i try to do port forwarding to visit a website through SSH it appears like that website won't foward the domain name solicited.  So if it's ssh -L 5000:cnn.com:80 user@sshserver i'll be forwarded to that IP but there won't be any host name and osmetimes i'll just get an apache site, how oculd i make sure the hostanme is forwarded_

[04:30:03] <Edu4rdSHL> It isn't rebuilding
[04:30:06] <Namarrgon> because it wasn't rebuilt after the python 3.10 update

[04:38:21] <Namarrgon> i wouldn't call this a point release either, it's a major update

[06:57:51] <EuphCat> Hello, I'm trying to set up PySide2 via pacman. The problem is, `pyside2-tools.py` in `pyside2-tools` package seems to expect `uic` and `rcc` in the same folder as `__init__.py` of PySide2, i.e. under `usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/PySide2/`, but they don't seem to be provided by any packages. Am I missing something?

[09:38:05] <novns> Scimmia, it's recommended by arch's wiki to add nvidia modules to initramfs, and you have to update it if you did this once

[09:40:37] <novns> iio7, so what's in logs?
[09:40:56] <Scimmia> if you use a non-default hook, that's up to you to configure as well, obviously
[09:41:01] <rcf> iio7: as for your issue, if everything is fully up to date, this is just the inescapable reality of out-of-tree modules. You can never guarantee some blob is going to work right in your kernel. I'd say try dkms but I think that's broken as well

[09:42:58] <Scimmia> grawity: ok, I see what you're saying
[09:43:19] <Scimmia> hooks are very different than adding random binaries or modules, though
[09:44:30] <grawity> then maybe nvidia should ship a mkinitcpio hook, since putting it in the initramfs is a common thing that's done a specific goal, and *that* would then trigger an automatic initramfs rebuild
[09:45:09] <grawity> but if not, then triggering mkinitcpio updates on third-party kernel modules doesn't seem like it would be wasteful most of the time

[09:49:34] <grawity> it could but that's probably too much work, I mean there aren't that *many* third-party kernel modules to begin with, and other than nvidia, most of their updates are just rebuilds for new kernels anyway
[09:50:02] <grawity> et09: did it froze during upgrade or what
[09:50:08] <novns> et09, did you update something recently?

[09:50:47] <rcf> et09: if your system crapped out during a kernel update that can happen. Use the installer to chroot in and try again and you should be good to go. 
[09:51:52] <et09> i did an Syu like, a few days ago
[09:52:02] <et09> i don't think it crapped out... hard to be sure tho 
[09:52:10] <grawity> were you missing the initramfs too, or only the kernel?

[09:52:30] <grawity> then sounds like it did die during -Syu
[09:52:38] <grawity> I mean /boot/vmlinuz isn't actually part of the package, it gets copied to /boot as part of the mkinitcpio trigger (incidentally, the same one we here are arguing about), so if the system died at around that point it could end up missing the initramfs *or* the kernel
[09:52:53] <et09> xor?
[09:53:07] <iio7> So I just added the pacman hook for nvidia and now it works. This should be changed in the wiki so it doesn't sit under the DRM kernel mode section IMHO.
[09:53:09] <grawity> no, regular english or, smartass

[10:01:11] <rcf> grawity: they use the old UNIX terminology, where block means buffered and character means raw.

[13:48:07] <raster> it's an apache issue (at least thats what i read at a glance) so it wont affect a home user
[13:48:37] <thurstylark> huh? how did you come to that conclusion?

[13:48:51] <raster> pingpongball:  why are you donewith arch?
[13:48:51] <thurstylark> fucking *minecraft* was affected
[13:48:54] <thurstylark> what you talking about
[13:49:18] <raster> the point of arch is to provide a base system with lots of packages to then use as a linux system. arch is a path to that point
[13:49:39] <bud> isn't it like 93.87% of all Java crap thats affected?

[13:53:05] <raster> if someone wants a simple answer to a simple question then "no - home users are not affected"
[13:53:20] <thurstylark> just because it was written by apache doesn't mean it's only for httpd
[13:53:20] <bud> wasn't the exploit discovered through minecraft even?

[19:49:58] <dummys_> so wondering from where this custom.db comes
[19:50:01] <Antiz> luigibu: Well, to remove it you can run "pacman -Rns xterm" (if it is indeed xterm).
[19:50:02] <dummys_> it should be repo.db for me

[23:46:31] <thurstylark> has been known to do weird things like leaving hardware in a strange state on shutdown, but not sure if its totally applicable here since it's been a while
[23:46:43] <robert> wait the vm crashed
[23:46:53] <robert> i think

[23:47:59] <thurstylark> damn, the only thing I can really think of to try is the lts kernel or rolling back a kernel version...

[23:48:30] <robert> what is the better option?
[23:48:52] <bud> when making a PKGBUILD from a git repo that have no releases/tags, is it fine to use `git describe --long --all | sed -r 's/.+-(.+)$/\1/g'` for pkgver ?
[23:49:55] <thurstylark> robert: with nvidia drivers, I'd switch to the dkms version, then try the lts kernel. if it works, try downgrading the non-lts kernel to see if you're affected by a regression
[23:50:23] <robert> how do i do this?

[23:51:16] <robert> is this likely to be fixed in a newer kernel? Could I just wait it out?

[23:52:48] <thurstylark> bud: there's a recommendation on the wiki to use revision count: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VCS_package_guidelines#The_pkgver()_function
[23:52:50] <phrik> Title: VCS package guidelines - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[23:53:28] <thurstylark> oh, apparently there's an -lts package for the nvidia drivers
[23:53:31] *** Joins: doombaby (~doombaby@216.109.199.128)
[23:54:28] <thurstylark> robert: so I'd install linux-lts and nvidia-lts, then configure your bootloader to boot to the lts kernel
[23:54:46] <robert> and see if that fixes it?
[23:55:29] <bud> thurstylark: thanks!
[23:56:01] <thurstylark> robert: yeah. if so, that points to some kernel version between the lts version and the current non-lts version
[23:57:11] <robert> this is still arch?
[23:57:33] *** Quits: bud (~bud@user/bud) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:57:38] <thurstylark> the lts kernel is supported

[23:58:31] <bud> so i found this cool pacman clone and want to make a package for it.
