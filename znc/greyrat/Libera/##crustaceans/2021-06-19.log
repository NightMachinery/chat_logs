[19:37:15] <mouseghost> hi
[19:43:08] <gerikson> hi mouseghost
[19:43:13] <gerikson> schools out?
[19:51:20] <mouseghost> gerikson, almost; this week will be the last one
[19:51:44] <gerikson> feeling ok?
[19:51:56] <gerikson> my kid had their graduation last week
[19:52:26] <mouseghost> how did it go?
[19:52:36] <mouseghost> i am neutral, i guess; though its way toooooo hot
[19:52:49] <mouseghost> glad that mock exams have ended
[19:55:55] <gerikson> dunno, they were very adamant about us *not* asking about grades
[19:56:09] <mouseghost> ah :x
[19:56:10] <gerikson> I think the last few months were really stressful
[19:56:16] <mouseghost> also, how are _you_ feeling?
[19:56:27] <gerikson> but they were invited to all social things which was nice
[19:56:34] <gerikson> it's a bit weird
[19:56:41] <gerikson> but a new phase in life I guess
[19:56:55] *** Joins: Church (~aleph@pool-98-116-232-112.nycmny.fios.verizon.net)
[19:57:09] <mouseghost> weird re invitation?
[19:57:22] <mouseghost> or weird re feeling
[19:59:45] <gerikson> no the feeling
[19:59:56] <gerikson> really happy with the invitation / inclusion
[20:00:14] <gerikson> kinda wish my kid would have taken a bit more initiative earlier but better late than never
[20:00:42] <mouseghost> hm
[20:00:50] <mouseghost> initiative, though?
[20:01:40] <mouseghost> whats there to do hm
[20:04:09] <gerikson> eh
[20:04:37] <gerikson> like being social is sort of like you get out more from it than you put in
[20:04:45] <gerikson> but it might be you don't realize that
[20:04:53] <gerikson> I dunno, this is all speculation on my part
[20:04:59] <gerikson> I was like that when I was younger
[20:05:31] <mouseghost> i mean, i am speaking more from a perspective, "uh.. what could you do anyways .w.?"
[20:05:43] <mouseghost> i do get that >like being social is sort of like you get out more from it than you put in
[20:06:17] <gerikson> I'm really thankful for the school for being supportive, and the class too
[20:06:23] <mouseghost> oh, nice then
[20:06:32] <gerikson> you got a job lined up for summer?
[20:07:55] <mouseghost> no, why?
[20:08:01] <mouseghost> is it common?
[20:08:11] <gerikson> heh
[20:08:16] <gerikson> kinda, here
[20:08:28] <mouseghost> hm i guess some go work...
[20:08:40] <gerikson> dollah dollah bill y'all
[20:08:51] <mouseghost> i am more of a contract person ;v
[20:08:54] <geoffwozniak> It used to be common here, at least.  I don't know if it still is
[20:13:27] <mouseghost> technically speaking ive been working on some programming things ;v
[20:14:34] <mouseghost> though, i am rather unsuccesful on the current one and it does not spark joy uh
[20:23:37] <geoffwozniak> ``In fact every #Bitcoin ASIC die comes with a little surface etching that reads: THIS MACHINE KILLS COMMUNISM''
[20:23:37] <buttsbot> More like buttcoin, am I rite!?
[20:23:49] <geoffwozniak> Good morning, Twitter
[20:24:35] <geoffwozniak> I'm amazed that the one account I follow that is a BTC believer doesn't have an avatar with glowing eyes
[20:26:50] <Brekkjern> I'm not sure how BTC kills communism? Doesn't it really do the exact opposite by the original definition of communism?
[20:30:10] <geoffwozniak> This is a person who thinks that markets should be controlling everything, everywhere
[20:30:37] <Brekkjern>  Yeah... Not sure what I expected
[20:42:06] <geoffwozniak> I mean... https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4QekgEWEAgba18?format=jpg&name=large
[21:03:50] <indigo> I wonder when we can start scheduling the lobsters global meetup
[21:29:04] <geoffwozniak> In Shediac? :)
[21:29:34] <geoffwozniak> Although I recall Chicago being the most likely place
[22:17:54] <indigo> Iâ€™m open to Shediac! Seems fun
[22:18:09] <indigo> But Chicago would be much easier
[22:31:56] <quanticle> geoffwozniak: Where's that quote from?

[22:35:27] <companion_cube> lol
[22:41:37] <wrl> lmfao
[22:41:55] <companion_cube> killing communism by killing the biosphere ðŸ’ª
[22:41:59] <companion_cube> power move
[22:42:25] <wrl> does bitcoin still cost like $50 to process a transaction
[22:42:25] <buttsbot> More like buttcoin, am I rite!?
[22:43:14] <wrl> oh now it's down to $5
[22:43:20] <wrl> https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee
[22:43:21] <buttsbot> -         Bitcoin Average Transaction Fee -
[22:43:34] <wrl> lmfao but it spikes up to >$50 whenever bitcoin is doing really well
[22:47:02] <gerikson> ngoldbaum: that ##freenode channel took a weird turn, I ducked out
[22:47:33] <companion_cube> godamnit I'm being nerd snipped by lua
[22:48:14] <alyx> oh god what happened this time
[22:49:30] <jjuran> It's the end of Freenode as we know it
[22:49:33] <jjuran> And I feel fine :-)
[22:50:22] <riv> https://i.postimg.cc/Qtw2YKNt/Screenshot-2021-06-19-19-19-48.png im reading this book and the motivating example that it uses for everything is preserving the dilbert comic
[22:50:30] <wrl> gerikson: saw on twitter that the GNAA dude was just chilling in there or sth?
[22:53:52] <gerikson> yeah and when he was finally banned a substantial contingent was upset
[22:54:27] <wrl> one of those fn admins is what fucked pissnet up in the beginning too
[22:54:33] <wrl> they're shit-stirrers
[22:54:47] <alyx> OwO
[22:55:03] <jjuran> Leave Freenode alone!
[22:55:11] <jjuran> s/ alone//
[22:55:20] <wrl> lol
[22:55:29] <gerikson> I mean they've nuked and paved Freenode, so there's no-one left to troll
[22:55:38] <gerikson> so ofc Libera is the next target
[22:55:47] <alyx> tbh i think leaving l0de in for last night was kinda reasonable; might as well have him there instead of having a flock of innocent ex-freenoders go explore efnet and get beat up for their lunch money
[22:56:14] <riv> what happened?
[22:56:30] <alyx> andrew lee was on the l0de radio hour
[22:56:40] <riv> I saw a bit of that this morning, but what happened in ##freenode ?
[22:56:52] <alyx> l0de was in ##freenode yesterday lol
[22:57:02] <wrl> yep
[22:57:45] <alyx> i still think "Better have a day-long truce with him than watch dozens of innocent but dumb folks find their way to efnet" but
[22:57:47] * alyx shrug

[23:17:43] <mouseghost> eh being lonely sucks
[23:17:50] <mouseghost> nobody to talk to
[23:17:54] <mouseghost> to hang out with
[23:20:42] <mouseghost> gerikson, what i mean about that initiative part is that, and also youve said about getting out more than putting it: how would that even depend on the interested person
[23:20:44] <mouseghost> idk..
[23:20:45] <mouseghost> eh
[23:20:51] <mouseghost> mouseghost's social problems
[23:20:51] <mouseghost> eh
[23:21:47] <companion_cube> are you socially isolating still?
[23:22:16] <mouseghost> what does socially isolating even mean? companion_cube
[23:23:04] <mouseghost> in rel. to corona?
[23:23:43] <mouseghost> tbh the only thing that changed was "we are going to school"->"we have online lessons"
[23:24:01] <mouseghost> now we're back to school since the beginning of june iirc
[23:24:22] <companion_cube> yes wrt covid
[23:24:36] <companion_cube> oh ok! do you know anyone at school?
[23:26:40] <mouseghost> companion_cube, define "know"?
[23:27:00] <mouseghost> i am aware of quite a few people
[23:27:03] <mouseghost> i guess i know a few people
[23:27:16] <mouseghost> but nobody wants to meet or anything interact outside of school
[23:29:54] <mouseghost> at most if they need something like "hey whats the wifi password"
