[00:11:32] <NthDegree> and it has nothing to do with spectre/meltdown
[00:12:41] <NthDegree> VBS is a measure used to shut off entire classes of kernel vulnerability in Windows as well as protecting against PtH attacks, however, it's a laughable measure given how weak their userland services are in terms of security
[00:13:07] <NthDegree> a vulnerability in a print spooler on Windows == pwnage
[00:13:21] <NthDegree> vulnerabilities in the SMB server? pwnage!
[00:16:54] <NthDegree> admittedly Microsoft has the better compiler-driven defences against many types of vulnerabilities... however that is slowly changing
[00:20:52] <MadCamel> Yeah. I'm happy linux compiles with clang and cfi now
[00:23:07] <NthDegree> I can't wait for gcc to get proper cfi support added for older systems
[00:23:18] <MadCamel> linux was superior for a while but with win10 microsoft really upped their game. Still playing catchup (ketchup?).
[00:24:48] <NthDegree> I think this is going to be one of these long term situations where Linux pulls ahead after Win11 is released
[00:29:30] <NthDegree> a lot of the latest mitigations now rely upon what is essentially Hyper-V while Linux is able to safely implement them without such overhead

[01:09:07] <sparc> Hey I have a question about source code security.   Are there best practices for preventing developers from copying source code off their company laptop?
[01:10:09] <sparc> I guess there are IDEs on the web you could use, that never download source code.  Some data-loss prevention tools, could probably white list certain applications for accessing source files.
[01:16:51] *** Quits: sed (~sed@pool-100-7-38-116.rcmdva.fios.verizon.net) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[01:18:15] <tomreyn> best practice is to trat your employees well and pay a competitive salary
[01:18:23] <tomreyn> *treat
[01:20:48] <NthDegree> sparc: it's impossible to police in practice
[01:21:19] <NthDegree> if you need to give bullshit assurances to third parties, use contracts/NDAs to do it rather than technical solutions
[01:21:37] <NthDegree> the reason why is because of the analog loophole
[01:22:20] <NthDegree> the moment code is visible to the human eye, it can be photographed and OCRed
[01:22:27] <NthDegree> and OCR training is easy for common fonts
[01:22:37] <Apachez> you could to some extent use terminal services / vnc or similar where you log the keystrokes and copy/pasting
[01:22:47] <Apachez> or just disable copying to the client
[01:22:57] <Apachez> but that will often make coding slower
[01:23:12] <Apachez> and will not help against somebody just photographing the screen
[01:23:33] <Apachez> so a legal nda that the devs signs is probably as much as you can do
[01:23:41] <NthDegree> That also doesn't stop people intercepting the keystrokes themselves with hardware to record what they type, mirroring everything to another computer
[01:23:43] <Apachez> along with having a great salary, dont be an ass as employer etc
[01:24:09] <Apachez> well what they code themselves is easily to bypass with a good memory
[01:24:18] <Apachez> but often there are more than one coder invovled over time

[01:29:17] <NthDegree> The other good defence is simply to make a shared source release, so anyone who wants to see the code can but can't use it for anything
[01:29:30] <NthDegree> this is what Microsoft ended up doing in the end
[01:31:38] <NthDegree> Or, you could design your software such that it uses COM or another binary-interoperable standard
[01:32:01] <NthDegree> or perhaps uses many small services with APIs
[01:32:36] <NthDegree> that way, your newer developers only get access to a small set of interfaces but not source code when making new things

[11:24:58] <samsi> lind{at}yahoo, you are being paranoid here. No agency would do something like that
[11:25:19] <euouae> I wanted to ask if yubikey is dangerous for people who live in dictatorships etc
[11:25:30] <jessicara> it's well known in the uk tested their own in a similar way

[11:26:12] <euouae> because I read an article from January where researchers were able to extract private keys from it by only having physical access
[11:26:14] <jessicara> although i wouldn't expect them to ask for money
[11:26:20] <lind{at}yahoo> You really think a random scam artist would be prepared to approach someone who can background check?
[11:27:23] <euouae> so I can imagine the following scenario: travel through dictatorship -> get detained -> your yubikey sent to a lab -> private keys obtained -> get arrested
[11:27:39] <samsi> lind{at}yahoo, No, but they don't need to be. They just give their personal info everytime. They don't care you check it
[11:27:58] <jessicara> i would not suggest paying
[11:27:59] <samsi> euouae, everything is hackable with physical access.
[11:27:59] <euouae> In the January article they were musing at how unlikely it is for the scenario to happen, but it seems utterly possible as I described it
[11:28:33] <euouae> samsi not true, how do you hack my brain for the secret key?
[11:28:52] <samsi> euouae, i interrogate you
[11:28:56] <lind{at}yahoo> Samsi: the identity is in The state of Georgia

[12:06:31] <ash_m> So, ubuntu uses some kind of keyring system to let you type you password once and then not have up for anything else until you restart. I rarely turn my laptop off or restart it. Is it safe to use this feature when, should my laptop be stolen, the attacker wouldn't need to enter my password.
[12:09:36] <NthDegree> yubikeys don't act as password storage on their own
[12:10:02] <NthDegree> they act as a form of 2FA based on "something you have"
[12:10:32] <NthDegree> they can't weaken security, even if stolen because the attacker still doesn't have your password

[20:24:31] <MadCamel> don't know about iphone but on android any app can hook reboots without special permissions.

[20:25:05] <[iz]> basically the advice from the IT crowd
[20:27:05] <[iz]> if you have a bunch of apps installed that do stuff automatically on startup, you could just be screwing yourself w/ a reinfection vector though
