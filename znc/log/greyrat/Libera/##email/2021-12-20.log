[15:57:10] <pagios>  hi all,  i am looking for a nice email stack, so i thought of postfix as MTA, dovecot as imap/pop3, i still need webmail, and a backup product any recommendation? any nice bundle that ofers these as one opensource project for example?
[16:00:39] <rob0> yeah, more on topic here
[16:01:05] <rob0> Zhang who maintains iredmail seems clueful.
[16:10:13] <Khepra> "nice email stack"  >>    GSuite, o365
[16:11:18] <pagios> need on premise solution
[16:11:41] <pagios> what do you guys recommend?
[16:11:46] <pagios> prefer something basic
[16:20:19] <furrymcgee> GNU mailutils is basic
[16:20:45] <koollman> my recommandation is to remember that managing mail is hard and frustrating ;)
[16:21:06] <koollman> but, if you like that kind of things, go for it
[16:21:16] <pagios> koollman: yea but what stack 
[16:21:29] <koollman> postfix and dovecot is a decent basis
[16:21:43] <tuxick> entire world is moving to klaut
[16:21:45] <pagios> postfix dovecot mysel spamassassin borg ?
[16:21:52] <pagios> klaut?
[16:22:10] <tuxick> google/microsoft/someone else's computer
[16:22:14] <pagios> cloud
[16:22:55] <tuxick> or they want to use outlook
[16:23:11] <tuxick> so you end up installing zimbra or kopano
[16:23:43] <pagios> they want outlook yea but imap on outlook tuxick
[16:24:07] <tuxick> then it doesn't matter indee
[16:24:15] <tuxick> even outlook can do imap
[16:24:34] <pagios> right, thats why i need to get a stack tht is stable and yet minimalisitc, dont need the collabotation rools etc
[16:24:44] <pagios> postfix dovecot mysel spamassassin borg ?
[16:24:53] <Khepra> pagios: the reason I Said Gsuite and o365 is because managing your own, even if you had a full stack managed by third party, is becoming increasingly difficult
[16:25:00] <koollman> it's never minimalistic, because mail is hard
[16:25:11] <tuxick> :)
[16:25:24] <furrymcgee> how many users?
[16:25:28] <tuxick> it's so hard most managers don't even believe a human can manage it
[16:25:31] <pagios> around 1000
[16:25:36] <Khepra> pagios: but ultimately, if you want to host yourself, then definitely DIY, don't depend on third party stacks that, evidently like Zimbra, are at the whims of their developers who, in times of increasingly difficult emailing business'ing will want to do the same as Zimbra
[16:25:37] <tuxick> so they throw their money at google
[16:25:54] <pagios> Khepra: exactly!
[16:25:57] <pagios> thats where i stand
[16:26:00] <Khepra> so DIY
[16:26:05] <pagios> i am locked in by zimbra and want to move away
[16:26:15] <pagios> so i am asking which DIY stack i go with
[16:26:20] <pagios> from your experiences
[16:26:24] <Khepra> so you're asking how to avoid one vendor lock-in by getting into another potential lock-in
[16:26:25] <tuxick> for 1k users you'll probably want mysql or ldap :)
[16:26:43] <Khepra> pagios: like I said, avoid full stacks, implement it yourself based on postfix, dovecot and ZFS
[16:26:44] <pagios> postfix dovecot mysel spamassassin borg  mysql ?
[16:26:45] <tuxick> ldap/AD would probably be there already
[16:27:16] <Khepra> pagios: postgres instead of mysql would be my recommendation. spamassassin works might fine but you have to train the bayes filter. 
[16:27:24] <pagios> tuxick: mysql for DB, and AAA  but why the need for ldap ? 
[16:27:38] <pagios> Khepra: yea familair with training the bayes
[16:27:54] <Khepra> we use roundcube as front end webmail but .... it sucks. I don't know of a better alternative. everyone is using mobile devices anyway, so it doesn't matter. RC is just a take-it-or-leave-it fallback we support
[16:28:08] <tuxick> roundcube isn't that bad
[16:28:13] <Khepra> it's terrible
[16:28:13] <pagios> Khepra: i am in the same shoes as you
[16:28:25] <pagios> need imap mainly and a baisc webmail
[16:28:28] <tuxick> there's rainloop
[16:28:40] <tuxick> looked impressive when i checked it
[16:28:56] <Khepra> MAJOR rc problem is the CSRF filter that kicks in if you close the browser tabs and reopen. even if you left it on the login screen, doesn't reload the tokens. so many tickets I've had from users to whom I had to explain they needed to close the tab, open a new one and type the webmail url again
[16:29:17] <tuxick> haha
[16:29:50] <Khepra> but ultimately, vast majority is using androids or iphones so nobody cares about RC :)
[16:30:26] <pagios> ok so mainly, i go with that tuxick Khepra postgres, spamassassin, postfix, dovecot, roundcube ?
[16:30:28] <Khepra> pagios: so that's it then. ZFS is a must under all that. screw borg and non-data-checksummig filesystems. 
[16:30:42] <pagios> ZFS for snapshotting right?
[16:31:18] <Khepra> if you value your data, ZFS and nothing else.  ðŸŽ¶  NOTHING. ELSE. MATTERS. ;)  ðŸŽµ 
[16:31:27] <pagios> \m/
[16:31:36] <tuxick> with 1k mailboxes i'd make management pay up for decent storage
[16:31:45] <Khepra> pagios: ZFS for data checksummed, snapshot capable, easy-backups-with-zfs-send-receive, transparent-compression    storage
[16:32:02] <pagios> i will have 2 nodes, one active one passive
[16:32:03] <koollman> Khepra: don't screw borg. still useful for backups that aren't just replicating the same things
[16:32:10] <pagios> backing up data from one to another on a daily basis
[16:32:27] <pagios> zfs replicates across different servers?
[16:32:35] <Khepra> koollman: metallica already spoke.
[16:32:37] <Khepra> ;)
[16:32:59] <rob0> Big and sometimes clueful companies find that outsourcing mail is the way to go.
[16:33:19] <Khepra> pagios: not by its own. if you want realtime replication.... postfix -> (lmtp) -> dovecot_01 -> (real time replication) -> dovecot_02 -> ...
[16:33:39] <pagios> Khepra: something like imapsync ?
[16:33:52] <rob0> For example, Red Hat Software, happy to sell you server software to run a mail stack, outsourced redhat.com mail.
[16:34:00] <Khepra> pagios: https://wiki.dovecot.org/Replication
[16:34:23] <colo> rob0, haha, really?
[16:34:26] <pagios> nice!
[16:34:46] <pagios> Khepra: can i use that replication to replicate data from current zimbra (which uses dovecot) to a new dovecot
[16:34:49] <tuxick> i haven't built a mailserver in years now
[16:35:13] <tuxick> last i did was install a kopano some years ago
[16:35:21] <Khepra> pagios: I don't know zimbra, but I'd assume if you could freely configure its dovecot, then I suppose yes
[16:35:42] <tuxick> zimbra is ok-ish
[16:35:49] <Khepra> tuxick: built... as in compiled or....
[16:35:52] <tuxick> but i wouldn't want to fiddle under the hood
[16:35:58] <pagios> it needs an ldap too no? how will it know how to create the accouns on dovecot on the destination host
[16:36:15] <pagios> yea compiled Khepra
[16:38:09] <pagios> wouldnt it be better to do ZFS to ZFS replication on the network instead of dovecot to dovecot
[16:38:16] <pagios> that way sql and all is backed up too
[16:38:32] <Khepra> sure but that's not realtime. 
[16:38:42] <pagios> dont really care about realtime :)
[16:38:53] <Khepra> then you can do something like 5 minutes snapshots
[16:39:07] <Khepra> the advantage of CoW is that snapshots are created almost instantly even if your dataset was terabytes
[16:39:11] <pagios> local snaps and then copy the snaps?
[16:39:25] <Khepra> zfs send | zfs receive     binary stream, 
[16:39:31] <pagios> amazing
[16:39:37] <pagios> thats over network
[16:39:59] <Khepra> zfs send is to   stdout    so you can redir stdout to wherever and however for zfs-receive's stdin
[16:42:43] <koollman> https://github.com/psy0rz/zfs_autobackup is quite nice
