[02:46:17] <kickingvegas> hi folks - noob elisp question; trying to pass the defvar (which itself runs a function) that returns a string into another function that takes a string argument. I get a "Wrong type argument: stringp". What am I doing wrong?
[02:46:34] <pjb> kickingvegas: defvar is not a function.
[02:46:52] <pjb> defvar returns the symbol that is defined as a variable name.
[02:47:09] <pjb> kickingvegas: try to be more explicit on your problem.
[02:48:30] <kickingvegas> pjb: fwiw, this is my defvar: (defvar cc-org-daily-header (format-time-string "CC Notes - %a %b %d %Y"))
[02:49:45] <kickingvegas> pjb: when i use cc-org-daily-header as a argument into the function (file+headline org-default-notes-file cc-org-daily-header) I get the wrong type argument error
[02:49:53] <pjb> (defvar cc-org-daily-header (format-time-string "CC Notes - %a %b %d %Y")) --> cc-org-daily-header ; works for me. cc-org-daily-header --> "CC Notes - Sun Mar 20 2022"
[02:50:29] <pjb> kickingvegas: defvar assigns the variable only if it is not already bound.
[02:50:42] <kickingvegas> pjb: yep, my defvar statement works fine; but using it in another function is broken
[02:50:56] <pjb> kickingvegas: instead, write; (defvar cc-org-daily-header) (setf cc-org-daily-header (format-time-string "CC Notes - %a %b %d %Y"))
[02:51:04] <daviid> it doesnt seem possible to pass a parameter when launching emacs, like
[02:51:18] <pjb> kickingvegas: you cannot use defvar in a function. Only as toplevel form.

[02:53:33] <pjb> daviid: well, there's no variable undecorated in my emacs.

[05:11:54] <_73> bpalmer: My interactive expression may do something though that I don't want to do under certain conditions.

[05:12:53] <_73> exactly
[05:13:10] <bpalmer> (interactive (list (nuke-canada) (if (had-waffles-p) (nuke-belgium) nil)))  <-- everything has to be inside the interactive.

[05:13:50] <_73> Ahh ok so then I can add a guard later. Got it thanks.
[05:13:56] <bpalmer> if you need to defer evaluation , use a place holder symbol in the interactive, and later on in the function, check for that special symbol

[07:36:52] <daviid> this is so weird - some printed values are 'ok', others wrong, and wrong, and the while loop should only create two frames, it create 3 frames

[07:38:37] <bpalmer> (let (... (i 0) (n-frame 6)) (while (< i n-frame) ... (setq i (1+ i))))
[07:38:40] <daviid> yes, as it doesn't work, i set n-frame to 2
[07:39:07] <bpalmer> daviid: so you should the initial frame that emacs creates, plus two new frames that you made.
[07:39:29] <daviid> oh ok
[07:39:31] <bpalmer> (if you started with emacs --daemon, I'm not sure if it creates an initial frame or not)

[08:03:31] <bpalmer> they're all invisible, I think (maybe they're just tiny?)
[08:04:07] <daviid> no, they are small but very visible :), here
[08:04:08] <bpalmer> no matter what emacs tries to do, it's going to be in a negotiation with the window manager (I use cinnamon on this system)

[08:05:38] <bpalmer> parsnip: just a guess, but dart support for flutter > rust support for flutter
[08:06:08] <parsnip> yes i'm nervous about the indirection
[08:06:28] <parsnip> but rust may attract more library authors
[08:06:49] <parsnip> and may be easier to wiggle into flutter than for example c++ or haskell

[08:08:37] <parsnip> i'd be okay with trying to limit the rust usage to annoying calculations that dart syntax is still tedious at

[08:12:45] <bpalmer> what sort of calculations are there that dart syntax is tedious at?
[08:13:00] <bpalmer> dart syntax is basically java's which for calculations is basically C
[08:13:34] <parsnip> well, built_value is implemented with code generators

[08:21:23] <parsnip> i think they'll make switch statements as expressions as well, though not sure that's a big deal once they already ahve pattern matching
[08:21:30] <sm> it's a tradeoff of course.. other languages are more powerful but they aren't built for the purpose of building cross platform GUI apps, with all the tight integration, hot reloading, polish and support for that task

[12:00:56] <Yves> Hello, I need a little help to improve the functions I wrote. I created a somewhat clone of lsp-ui-peek functions to run a rip-grep search dynamically, meaning as the user types the search the search runs and updates the elements shown. This works great but the problem is the management of threads / processes. As soon as I start rg emacs will hang
[12:00:57] <Yves> waiting for the execution of rg to finish. I want to run the search in the background if possible. I tried different solutions (deferred, make-thread, etc.) which do not help me preventing the hanging of emacs. In addition to the prevention of hanging I also want to cancel running searches as soon the user cancels or refines the search (e.g. by
[12:00:57] <Yves> entering an additional character). Are there any resources I can take a look at which help me to create threads (which may be handled by the os) or a sub-process and how I would handle their lifetimes? Thanks for your help in advance :)

[12:08:17] <energizer> i thought people always said the dot, even back then
[12:12:29] <Yves> so I could for example use start-process-shell-command with an output stream to handle the output of rg instead? I would then also use the returned process object for managing the sub-process (e.g. for canceling, etc.), right?
[12:13:35] <bpalmer> Yves: yes.
[12:14:03] <Yves> alright I will give that a try. Thank you for your help bpalmer :)
[12:14:26] <bpalmer> you could use async-shell-command (or shell-command with an & at the end of the shell command), but process objects give you the added flexibility

[14:09:18] <wasamasa> yes, sometimes the font was a bit too small or too large

[14:09:56] <kensanata> Blaming anything containing the word "font" is easy.
[14:10:08] <wasamasa> so I compensated by changing the font size to 13.5 or 14
[14:10:30] <kensanata> I also have this useless app called "Fonts" that takes forever to load and then doesn't help me pick a good font. Must have been design for people having ten fonts at most.

[14:46:54] <wasamasa> that is the thing, they equated peer review to someone doing a code review
[14:46:58] <codingquark> Nobody is a "peer" of my SUPERIORITY!
[14:47:08] <wasamasa> and if the code is absolute trash, no amount of review will fix it

[14:47:52] <CaCode> review is great but it isnt perfect.. even in coding
[14:48:08] <CaCode> "it's the best we got" sorta deal
[14:48:19] <parsnip> there's no hyper key on macos
[14:48:30] <codingquark> What about the idea of distributed consensus applied to scientific reviews?
[14:48:34] <codingquark> Is anybody thinking about it?
[14:48:39] <CaCode> parsnip... seems like i would have lost that 0.5 US$
[14:49:14] <CaCode> codingquark, or just making access to all scientific output free and gratis to everybody?
[14:49:28] <parsnip> i mean, you might be able to use H- as a binding in emacs, but damned if i know the best way
[14:49:52] <parsnip> but in some sense, macOS doesn't have hyper, iiuc
[14:49:55] <CaCode> I don't understand why these very honorable scientific journals get to keep the scientific output of the world hostage even though most science is funded by taxes or businesses anyways
[14:50:13] <CaCode> it would be great if it was like free software where everybody can access any code
[14:50:34] <parsnip> the world is fucked
[14:50:42] <CaCode> parsnip I will get back to you and tell you how to do it if...
[14:50:59] <CaCode> parsnip if it can get fucked it can also get unfucked
[14:51:03] <CaCode> sometimes...
[14:51:05] <parsnip> the sooner everyone dies, the sooner, we can let another creatyre evolve to be smarter
[14:51:18] <bremner> I have never used hyper as a modifer in emacs
[14:51:27] <bremner> or in my window manager for that matter
[14:51:45] <parsnip> i have an approximation to hyper in my window manager

[18:52:25] <corwin> ah, that suggests `format' should work also
[18:52:46] <wasamasa> one gotcha is mistaking the return value of the printing functions with their side effect
[18:52:55] <johnjaye> i'm sure all these princ and prin1 etc things make sense in the context in which they were created
[18:53:05] <johnjaye> they just don't make much sense to me
[18:53:11] <bremner> context == 1954?
[18:53:34] <thuna`> Would changing `standard-output' not break those?

[19:20:40] <ychaouche> I'd like to save the current position, for example by leaving a mark, then get back to it later. I only need to save one mark. Is there a quick way to jump back to the mark after I leave it ?
[19:21:03] <grym> C-x SPC and then later C-x C-x ?
[19:21:26] <thuna`> corwin: Well, I need to do different things depending on `standard-output' the way print and co. does
[19:21:43] <ychaouche> yeah, I used to do that, but I need to add an extra C-g after C-x <space> so that the region doesn't get selected (which is a little bit distracting)
[19:22:22] *** Quits: kts (~kts@103.73.237.62) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[19:22:48] <ychaouche> also C-g after C-x C-x because it will reselect the region.
[19:22:50] <thuna`> But I don't know if format works like that
[19:23:27] <thuna`> Or, rather, I just need a lower-level function that does it
[19:23:31] <ychaouche> also It's C-<space> directly (no need for C-x)

[22:48:05] <bpalmer> kickingvegas: it's not particularly arcane; the confusion is mostly because it's in a transition period (but, to be sure, the people doing the transitioning have chosen to make to the changes in a not very visible way)
