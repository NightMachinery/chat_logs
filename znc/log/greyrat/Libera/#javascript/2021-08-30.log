[00:16:16] <linguist> Hello! I'm not familiar with this syntax and can't grasp a name to Google it: const order: number[] = [];
[00:16:30] <linguist> Could anyone point how this is named so I can read about?
[00:16:41] <sheetjs> which part?
[00:16:46] *** Quits: kill (~killown@user/killown) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[00:16:50] <sheetjs> the `: number[]` part is typescript
[00:16:58] <sheetjs> `const` is ES6
[00:17:44] <linguist> I think my issue is with everything after const, LOL
[00:18:19] <systemfault> If you remove the typescript, it's just: const order = [];
[00:18:36] <linguist> So, I have heard about this typescript and have been curious for a while, I guess I'll have to learn
[00:18:39] <systemfault> and if you don't understand that, you don't need an explanation here, you need a book :)

[00:21:40] <linguist> systemfault, indeed I think I could use one LOL any recommendation?
[00:22:07] <systemfault> The one people seem to recommend here is "eloquent javascript"
[00:22:11] <systemfault> !eloquent @ linguist
[00:22:11] <jellobot> linguist, Eloquent JavaScript is a comprehensive introductory Web-based book with examples and a built-in interpreter. http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[00:22:32] <linguist> Thanks
[00:22:36] <cAMP> whats the problem? that defines a constant named order, with type number array, with value []?
[00:23:15] <linguist> Ohhh, you mean if I don't understand the const part? I thought you were talking about the typescript
[00:23:24] <cAMP> so, in fact, you wanted #typescript
[00:23:48] <systemfault> Doesn't change much, you should know JS even if you do TypeScript.
[00:25:24] <linguist> If I am getting it right, TypeScript is a kind of "type enforcement" for JS?
[00:25:49] <systemfault> Yeah
[00:26:00] <linguist> So, I guess this code would force order to be an empty array of "number[]"?

[06:34:46] <Tabmow> I'm using Vue.JS with a SPA and I'm redirecting to the Login route when a user logouts, which is all working fine. However, because of the SPA nature if a user never hits my site at '/' they won't pick up new JS changes etc. - is there a best practice way to solve this?
[06:36:29] <electrostatic> Well, the easy way is likely a timed check
[06:37:32] <electrostatic> Have them grab a json every few minutes with the current rev level, and if their js does not match that, force a reload
[06:38:32] <electrostatic> It's not a very lazy approach as it uses polling, though
[06:38:42] <Tabmow> Well I have a token expiry time which will inevitably redirect them back to the login page when it expires, so I'm happy with that amount of time of them possible having old code

[06:52:28] <wroathe> Tabmow: Well, what you do depends on the logout initiator. If it's the user clicking a logout button, a simple anchor tag <a href="/"> with an event listener that deletes any potentially unwanted persistent storage but DOES NOT prevent the default would be what I would do
[06:52:48] <wroathe> Tabmow: And if the initiator is token expiry, then document.location.href is the way to go (with the same teardown as the other case)
[06:52:56] *** Joins: gggp (~textual@194.5.79.213)
[06:53:45] <wroathe> Or you could prevent the default on that anchor tag I suppose and just call the same routine as the token expiry case (that eventually redirects via document.location.href)
[06:54:10] <Tabmow> wroathe: yeah, that's basically what I've done. Just testing it now to ensure it all works correctly.

[13:40:12] <electrostatic> teut, idk what format thing you are talking about, but an iframe is designed to hold an html document inside an html document, and a video element is designed to hold a video player

[13:41:41] <teut> so I embedded a webpage or youtube 's player?
[13:42:07] <teut> the player that youtube uses is more than a video player afaik
[13:42:26] <teut> it has something to do with streaming and all
[13:44:41] <DPA> <iframe allows embeding any webpage. In the DOM, it's an HTMLIFrameElement and get's it's own Window (.contentWindow) and all. The content won't usually affect the embedding site much if at all, there is also the sandbox attribute to add restrictions to the embedded site.
[13:44:41] <DPA> <video reacts more sensibly and allows better video handling for real video files. The dimension of the video file can affect its size, it can have alternate sources, subtitles, etc. In the DOM, it's an HTMLVideoElement,
[13:44:42] <DPA> and has methods such as .play(), .pause(), variouse events, etc. It can also be used as a webgl texture and drawn to a canves. It can also be wrapped by existing player libraries.
[13:46:00] <teut> thats interesting ..
[13:47:08] <DPA> For youtube, an iframe makes it easier to enforce stuff like their player, making sure their ads really play, etc. while still giving the embedder some isolation so they don't have to trust googles js code.
[13:47:18] <teut> <video src="https://youtu.be/xnqTKD8uD64"></video>
[13:47:25] <teut> see nothing happens
[13:47:39] <teut> and even in my site there are those  format errors
[13:48:18] <teut> https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/8735f52d24d0f0c185e24199681cca75/image.png
[13:48:34] <teut> this is the result of using a video tag
[13:48:35] <DPA> Because it's not a video file, it's a html page from youtube. They won't give you links to the real files / streams.
[13:49:05] <teut> its not a video?
[13:49:10] <teut> thats weird
[13:49:27] <teut> so who can use it?
[13:49:50] <teut> oh its for sharing a link
[13:49:56] <teut> ok ok ,mb
[13:50:41] <teut> but how do you make a player like that in a html script?

[13:57:50] <DPA> Well, youtube knows where it's video files are, so they just play them, make the custom controls using HTML elements, listen to events when the user clicks them, and calls the appropriate functions on the video element.
[13:57:50] <DPA> They also listen for some events from the video to detect time, end, etc. They may be rendering it to a canvas. And it may be a bit more complicated than that if/when they use EME / WebRTC, in which case they create & assign a stream to the video tag, to put things strongly simplified.
[14:01:23] <teut> oh , webRTc, I havent explored this technology yet but I have made some basic <canvas/> games

[18:15:02] <DPA> There is only 1 aTag, 1 a element you create. Each time you add it somewhere else, it is removed from it's old parent.
[18:16:15] <DPA> 1st version was otherwise fine .
[18:20:20] <Alexthek1d> DPA, thanks, but how can i make multiple without writing tons of duplicate code?
[18:22:52] <DPA> You can either put the code for creating them in a function (or just inside the loop here), or you could use .cloneNode(true), but that will not preserve the event listeners.

[23:03:23] <ljharb> that's why you don't install software from unofficial distribution channels
[23:03:23] <domhnall> heh...

[23:03:40] <ljharb> i don't know what "red to black" means

[23:08:41] <parazyd> Does anyone have some snippet in javascript that can do this? https://parazyd.org/pub/dev/random/js.webm
[23:08:53] <domhnall> its my poor choice of code editor that's the problem.
[23:08:57] <parazyd> Basically I want an arbitrary grid, and be able to select rectangles in it
[23:09:29] <parazyd> And the coordinates should somehow be accessible
[23:09:30] <domhnall> not exactly poor choice, I'm actually comfortable with it.

[23:10:09] <domhnall> systemfault: very much so...

[23:13:02] <sheetjs> systemfault:  is brackets still alive?

[23:13:36] <systemfault> The answer, I don't know..
[23:13:52] <sheetjs> it probably helps to have an alternative
[23:14:14] <systemfault> I love alternatives...
[23:14:25] <domhnall> ljharb: I use VSCode more than Atom, just when doing one-off scripting or testing something in repl cycle, I use Atom.

[23:30:34] <domhnall> maybe I should learn more about vscode, but in atom, i can just do 'ctrl+shift+b' and run my script. not sure how to do in vscode. run with/without debug doesn't seem to be what i'm expecting.
