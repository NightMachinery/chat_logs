[06:13:43] <pj> echoSMILE: sure, DKIM is only checked if it's present in the message.
[06:14:44] <echoSMILE> but if DKIM check is with a bad result the spam score grows ?
[06:16:38] <pj> echoSMILE: someone who spoofs the From: header is not likely to DKIM sign the message, and if they do it would pass DKIM.
[06:17:46] <echoSMILE> If they do they have access to the keys of the dkim
[06:18:04] <pj> they can sign it with their own keys for their own domain.
[06:18:14] <pj> DKIM is not meant to prevent spoofing, it's meant to authenticate a legitimate message from a particular sender.
[06:18:33] <pj> If you want to prevent spoofing then you should be looking at DMARC
[06:19:00] <pj> !dmarc
[06:19:01] <dig-dug> pj: dmarc: (#1) "Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance": Enforces SPF and DKIM to the From: header via DNS records. You probably don't need DMARC. For more info see https://dmarc.org/, or (#2) Also see !easy_dmarc
[06:19:04] <pj> !dkim
[06:19:05] <dig-dug> pj: dkim: DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is a method for email authentication that allows an organization to take responsibility for a message in a way that can be validated by a recipient. this is typically implemented by means of a milter such as !opendkim. alternatively, existing content filters (e.g. !amavisd-new) may also have their own implementation mechanism.

[06:21:54] <echoSMILE> pj: let me try to reformulate my initial question: if someone try to fake the "from" header, the DKIM at the recipient will check it and the message will have a high spam score right?
[06:22:19] <pj> no
[06:32:32] <noarb> !easy_dmarc
[06:32:34] <dig-dug> noarb: easy_dmarc: If you just need a DMARC policy to help satisfy ESP recommendations you can use this to basically tell servers not to enforce DMARC on your mail: _dmarc.example.com. TXT "v=DMARC1;p=none;adkim=r;aspf=r;pct=0"
[06:35:07] <echoSMILE> What I want to only understand is if is there any way to prevent the abuse of "from" header.
