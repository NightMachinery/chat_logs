[00:01:13] <Baphomet> I have some traumas from a time where we used a very huge database of domains and categories in a proxy server and had obvious performance issues LOL (I told them it would happen)
[00:01:57] <xnaas> * +bookworm starts throwing postgres at the problem
[00:01:57] <xnaas> This but unironically.
[00:01:58] <xnaas> Ship it.
[00:01:59] <xnaas> :P
[00:02:33] <bookworm> Baphomet: with sqlite?
[00:02:38] <bookworm> or a real DB?
[00:05:16] <xnaas> <Baphomet> I'm loving to talk here, I didn't know the /search command
[00:05:16] <xnaas> Press the ? in the bottom of the server/channel list. üòâ There's a lot of info in there.
[00:06:41] <Baphomet> bookworm: yes, in an embedded system
[00:07:55] <Baphomet> xnaas: I'm ashamed that I hadn't yet
[00:08:00] <xnaas> :)
[00:08:15] <xnaas> It's ok. Half the questions in #thelounge are "I didn't read config.js"
[00:08:16] <xnaas> :P
[00:10:15] <Baphomet> Well, I think it's acceptable for a typical end-user or something like that, even though I admit that a lot of times I didn't read docs myself 
[00:11:32] <Baphomet> I'm loving the keybindings 
[00:12:17] <Baphomet> üçæ
[00:12:26] * xnaas might've gotten bored/interested https://xnaas.info/tmp/Ykl.webp
[00:13:57] <Baphomet> Just a curiosity, are those emojis an emoji code that goes as text to thelounge and only it interprets? Or you use actually emoji characters? 
[00:14:18] <bookworm> the usual utf8 emoji code
[00:15:40] * Baphomet slaps Baphomet around a bit with a large trout
[00:16:01] * xnaas slaps Baphomet around a bit with a large trout
[00:16:10] <xnaas> Well, I can say that ReactOS is not great in a VM lol
[00:17:29] <Baphomet> Well, thanks for showing me that, I think you did a GREAT job in the UI here
[00:17:53] <Baphomet> Also, I totally forgot IRC had colors
[00:18:24] <xnaas> rainbow text is the best
[00:18:35] <xnaas> Though I don't have the knowledge to make a /rainbow
[00:18:44] <xnaas> Just use a bot for it on my server. :P
[00:19:31] <Baphomet> 04Y08e03a06h
[00:19:38] <xnaas> Most of the users on my server use thelounge, so we take advantage of nice stuff like being able to have spoiler text you can hover (or tap on mobile) to reveal
[00:19:57] <xnaas> 01,01you'll need to add custom CSS to make this readable on hover/tap
[00:20:23] <Baphomet> Ohhh, I see, it's quite interesting
[00:20:24] <xnaas> Pretty sure my custom CSS is up-to-date on https://kb.xnaas.info/software/thelounge/ but idk
[00:20:55] <Baphomet> If not one can always select the text LOL
[00:21:47] <Baphomet> What irc daemon do you use, xnaas?
[00:21:58] <xnaas> https://ergo.chat
[00:22:06] <xnaas> nothing compete is simplicity and no bullshit, imo
[00:22:18] <xnaas> everything else is an utter time-waste to setup
[00:22:45] <jjasghar> xnaas, thanks for the link to your CSS, it's made my lounge so much cleaner
[00:22:48] <xnaas> I wasted so much time setting up unreal and other shit (before giving up and using freenode for a few months before finding ergo)
[00:22:49] <Baphomet> I have a server on discord an super loved the idea of moving it to IRC
[00:23:38] <xnaas> My core group had been all over before we found Discord on launch day in 2015 or whatever ‚Äî some people came from IRC, some just from in-game shit, some random TeamSpeak servers, etc.
[00:23:44] <xnaas> we'd been through so many protocols and shit
[00:23:49] <xnaas> but were on Discord for years
[00:23:55] <xnaas> I grew less and less fond of Discord over time
[00:24:05] <xnaas> so said "fuck this, back to irc" ‚Äî the good people made it over, I guess ;P
[00:24:26] <xnaas> Really only one active member didn't come over; his loss :D
[00:25:35] <Baphomet> Thanks too, it's much more readable with your custom CSS
[00:26:14] <Baphomet> I use the light theme here but it wasn't good to read 
[00:26:22] <xnaas> note: some of the CSS isn't very mobile friendly
[00:26:27] <xnaas> like the larger image embeds
[00:26:34] <xnaas> I tuned it for my specific desktop situation :P
[00:26:52] <xnaas> I should use % scaling or whatever but ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[00:27:09] * xnaas just half-asses his way through life üòé
[00:28:33] <xnaas> the /* Make #channels appears as links */ code also...has some unfortunate side-effects
[00:29:27] <xnaas> like showing #123: as a channel, with the :
[00:29:35] <xnaas> which is valid, I guess
[00:29:40] <xnaas> but not what one would actually want
[00:29:41] <xnaas> lol
[00:30:56] <xnaas> I should probably add credit to dgw for the hover spoilers as well
[00:31:06] <xnaas> https://gist.github.com/dgw/3aac59b4103b5ea8f4ca6e0b0f18d27b#file-the-lounge-spoiler-hover-css
[00:45:26] <xnaas> as an aside
[00:45:31] <xnaas> and maybe this belongs in #thelounge
[00:45:35] <xnaas> rather than #thelounge-offtopic
[00:45:35] <xnaas> but
[00:46:24] * bookworm readies the boring factoid
[00:46:33] <xnaas> heh
[00:47:11] <xnaas> I would like to see a serious discussion on the goals/direction of thelounge. I know that xpaw had a vision for the client, but he doesn't want to maintain thelounge any more. I see a lot of "well, we want to keep the client overly simple so we won't accepts PRs for X, Y, and Z" and I think that's super unfortunate.
[00:48:03] <xnaas> Alas, as someone without the desire to learn node anyway, I can't follow the tried-and-true "just fork it" :P
[00:48:29] <bookworm> "do it properly and make it pluggable" is not the same as "nah"
[00:48:51] <xnaas> I think that would also require some in-depth api docs üò¨
[00:48:59] <xnaas> and for the api to be "finished" or whatever
[00:49:04] <bookworm> no it requires *design* foremost
[00:49:12] <bookworm> meaning 1) start collecting use cases
[00:51:00] <xnaas> Well, whether it's an Issue or a Discussion on GitHub, I'm sure lots of people have lots of opinions to contribute. :)
[00:51:16] <bookworm> sure
[00:51:32] <bookworm> the problem is the usual... people come in with their pet problem and only want to solve that specific one
[00:51:51] <bookworm> and in the end you end with an unmaintainable mess and a gazillion options
[00:52:00] <bookworm> that's why xPaw often pushed back in the past
[00:52:47] <xnaas> I get the reasoning, I would just like to see something with the option to be more powerful, ya know? I don't want to have to go to a terminal to have options but lose out on the plethora of benefits of a web client üòÖ
[00:53:27] <xnaas> (and I don't mean to be an ass, but the rest of the IRC web clients suck; I've tried them all in recent history)
[00:53:52] <bookworm> yeah I know... the problem is that the feature set of such a client is not user friendly for a newbie
[00:53:58] <bookworm> which TL aims at
[00:54:15] <xnaas> I think that's a fundamentally flawed goal for an IRC client in 2022. üò¨
[00:54:16] <bookworm> or at least, hide most of the details where it can, don't have a gazillion option
[00:54:22] <bookworm> yeah...
[00:54:41] <bookworm> I got the hat only a short while ago... for the time being I'm certainly not changing strategy though
[00:54:47] <bookworm> first, dependencies.
[00:54:53] <bookworm> next: refactoring
[00:54:59] <bookworm> then I start messing with things, maybe
[00:55:15] <xnaas> Of course; I don't expect anything disruptive, just want it to be openly discussed, considered for the future, etc., if possible.
[00:55:36] <bookworm> consider that we have a skeleton crew have some patience ;)
[00:55:58] <xnaas> Of course. If I wanted things now I'd learn node and help. :P
[00:56:08] <bookworm> s/node/javascript/
[00:56:14] <bookworm> node is not a large thing
[00:56:17] <xnaas> s/node/anything
[00:56:30] <xnaas> I don't even learn Python and use it every day to maintain my server's bot ;P
[00:56:34] <bookworm> hey, if I can learn enough js to break stuff so can you
[00:57:32] <xnaas> can vs want to :P
[00:58:05] <xnaas> And it's nothing personal against JS. I don't want to learn Rust, golang, Python, or anything else either :P
[00:58:32] * xnaas is not a programmer, just a user of code
[01:01:51] <xnaas> anyway, it's reassuring that at least one maintainer (maybe more!) are at least partially on board with the idea of having thelounge expand past "be only newb friendly" someday in the future. :)
[01:17:49] <xnaas> oh yeah, and add DCC file transfers /s
[01:17:56] * xnaas just baitin' on that one
[01:20:58] <MaxLeiter> Newbie friendly doesnt have to mean anti-power user 
[01:21:24] <MaxLeiter> it just means being conscientious about defaults and visibility 
[01:21:54] <bookworm> yeah... but throwing them an all or nothing toggle is also not exactly good I think
[01:22:09] <bookworm> as of now we have some things behind the "advanced" flag which are questionable
[01:23:17] <bookworm> tabs might help
[01:23:20] <bookworm> we'll see
[01:30:38] <bookworm> let's encrypt fucked up, how nice
[01:30:43] <bookworm> https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/questions-about-renewing-before-tls-alpn-01-revocations/170449
[01:40:12] <bookworm> on the plus side, supposedly caddy should fix it on its own? We'll see
[01:40:26] <bookworm> If I drop dead suddenly you know why... my TL instance domain is affected
[01:42:26] <Baphomet> Ohhhh, everything you said sound cool, except for DCC LOL
[01:42:51] <bookworm> kids these days... torrents are a thing
[01:45:22] <xnaas> ironically
[01:45:34] <xnaas> I have to DCC once or twice a year because torrents don't have it
[01:45:39] <xnaas> (I then make a torrent, of course)
[01:45:56] <bookworm> naturally we are talking about linux distros, caugh
[01:46:03] <xnaas> but hexchat gets it done, so meh; good enough :P
[01:46:10] <bookworm> as everything else would be against liberas TOS :P
[01:46:12] * xnaas is talking about stealing from the Japanese
[01:46:15] <xnaas> :P
[01:46:36] <xnaas> is it really stealing if it's something older than IRC that you can't even buy tho
[01:47:23] <Baphomet> I think one interesting thing would be to have optional support for file uploads... i.e. I send a code or an image and it sends a link to the channel (where to host might be a practical problem in my idea, I know) then if the type is known, TL users would see the content (a formatted code, an image, whatever), or else a download option
[01:47:34] <Baphomet> If it's present already and I don't know please disregard LOL
[01:47:58] <bookworm> already there for actual files
[01:48:11] <xnaas> https://irc.xnaas.info/uploads/77ef10083e82c9be/image.png 
[01:48:18] <bookworm> for ad hoc text upload, Max has a PR 
[01:48:23] <Baphomet> Okay, never mind them
[01:48:24] * xnaas just used Win+Shift+S and Ctrl+V
[01:48:25] <xnaas> :P
[01:48:33] *** Quits: martums5 (~martums@user/martums) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:48:42] <bookworm> your choice of colors is... questionable
[01:48:48] <xnaas> what colors
[01:48:51] <xnaas> my nick?
[01:48:56] <bookworm> everything
[01:48:59] <xnaas> I was pink on Discord, I'm gonna fucking be pink here
[01:49:10] <xnaas> idk, it's just solarized
[01:49:17] <xnaas> minus my custom nick color
[01:49:18] <xnaas> :P
[01:49:25] <bookworm> the url barely has any contrast
[01:49:44] <xnaas> eh, seems fine on my IPS display
[01:50:12] <bookworm> upgrading deps is a shit job
[01:50:20] <Baphomet> Well, to be honest I just recently became a desktop linux user, I wasn't even sure I could copy and paste stuff LOL
[01:50:29] <bookworm> no wonder no one does it, yet pulls in a million deps
[01:50:30] <xnaas> lol
[01:50:45] <xnaas> grats on switching to linux
[01:50:56] <xnaas> I'll be back on Linux on my desktop come 2025 and the end of Windows 10
[01:51:02] * xnaas grew up on Debian and Gnome
[01:51:06] <xnaas> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[01:51:15] <Baphomet> are you on w10?
[01:51:18] <xnaas> I am.
[01:51:22] <xnaas> Right now, as we speak.
[01:51:26] <xnaas> s/speak/type
[01:51:27] <xnaas> :P
[01:51:32] <Baphomet> wow, you don't look much like a windows user LOL
[01:51:39] <Baphomet> neither did I
[01:51:45] *** Joins: martums5 (~martums@user/martums)
[01:51:49] <xnaas> I use it because I play multiplayer video games
[01:51:50] <xnaas> so
[01:51:52] <xnaas> kinda no choice
[01:51:54] <xnaas> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[01:52:01] <Baphomet> Ohhhh, I see
[01:52:08] <xnaas> hoping that situation is better by 2025, but skeptical
[01:52:17] <xnaas> If it's not, then so be it, no more multiplayer games for me.
[01:52:27] <bookworm> maybe the arch handheld from valve will help
[01:52:32] <xnaas> ^
[01:52:36] <xnaas> that's basically what I'm hoping for
[01:52:41] <xnaas> if it flops...then RIP
[01:52:55] <bookworm> I mean they are literally paying emersion so the direction is good
[01:53:07] * xnaas knows better than to get his hopes up
[01:53:08] <bookworm> (wayland dev, sway maintainer, sr.ht camp)
[01:53:11] <Baphomet> Well, if you asked me 2 years ago if I would want to code agan or if I would use Linux again I would say the one asking was crazy
[01:53:22] <xnaas> it's been the year of the linux desktop for...checks calendar 20 years?
[01:53:23] <xnaas> :P
[01:53:36] <bookworm> works for me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[01:53:43] <bookworm> better than windows in fact
[01:53:48] <Baphomet> So I bought a laptop without caring for compatible hardware
[01:54:08] <bookworm> Dell XPS dev edition, preloaded with Ubuntu
[01:54:24] <xnaas> Other than multiplayer gaming, I don't look forward to deciding on a new text editor (I just use notepad++ for everything; I hate vscode) and trying to half-assed replace ShareX.
[01:54:25] <bookworm> never again do I want an out of tree wifi driver in my laptop
[01:54:43] <Baphomet> Then I started my masters, had to code, the pandemics started and I decided I missed linux (after 10 years aaway)
[01:55:14] <bookworm> what do you do?
[01:55:18] <Baphomet> And the first issue was: I have an nvidia card
[01:55:40] <bookworm> ah, to quote our elders: fuck nvidia
[01:55:44] <xnaas> <+bookworm> better than windows in fact
[01:55:44] <xnaas> As long as you don't need any of a plethora of software that is Windows-only with no or awful Linux alternatives. :P
[01:56:04] <bookworm> there's only two: photoshop and lightroom
[01:56:10] <bookworm> else I don't miss a thing
[01:56:18] * xnaas cries in GIMP
[01:56:31] <bookworm> but I get a same env for code and have a tiling WM
[01:56:50] <bookworm> and it gets out of my way in contrast to windows
[01:56:58] <xnaas> speaking of DEs...I tried 'em all out recently
[01:57:02] <xnaas> and none really wow'd me
[01:57:08] <Baphomet> bookworm: well, when I left that company I mentioned before I started one of my own, but then I got terrible partners and decided I would sell it and finish my degree (after way too many years trying), so I've been kinda a professional students for the last years
[01:57:13] * xnaas knows a WM isn't a DE, was just transitioning to it :P
[01:57:41] <Baphomet> xnaas: I have an issue, I can't adapt to Linux available office suites 
[01:57:55] <Baphomet> So I run a VM only for that
[01:57:56] <xnaas> I use LibreOffice on my Windows box üò¨
[01:58:00] <bookworm> to make windows slightly more tolerable I can warmly recommend powertoys
[01:58:05] <xnaas> ^
[01:58:10] <xnaas> powertoys helps a lot
[01:58:14] <xnaas> doesn't fix everything
[01:58:18] <xnaas> of course
[01:58:21] <xnaas> but good god does it help
[01:58:29] <bookworm> nah, the tiling support is still shitty
[01:59:00] <Baphomet> xnaas: I have liked LibreOffice thousands of years ago, when there were almost the same thing as in Word, but since Word 2016 it's really hard to leave it
[01:59:06] <bookworm> and the launcher is subpar in comparison to my own dmenu but hey
[01:59:09] <xnaas> But yeah, I just didn't care for any of the DEs currently available on Linux, I guess. ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ GNOME 2 with modern support pls :P
[01:59:19] <Baphomet> Bibliography management is way too easy
[01:59:33] <xnaas> fair 'nuff, Baphomet; I don't do anything advanced
[01:59:40] <xnaas> and if I do, I don't share it with other humans anyway
[01:59:41] <xnaas> :P
[01:59:47] <bookworm> yeah well luckily I don't need to bother with citations
[02:06:40] <Baphomet> I've been explored by a public research funding agency for a long time, for me it's been something I don constantly 
[02:07:26] <Baphomet> (don't mind strange characters when I type, my keyboard is new and smaller, I keep mistaking keys)
[02:07:55] <bookworm> you should see me with a phone keyboard... I'm certainly not judging
[02:09:16] <Baphomet> Ohhh, I too have problem with that, I can't stand the fact that keys are so small and that shitty software turns your words into bizarre things
[02:10:18] <Baphomet> It's a dilemma actually, you don't use text prediction you take years to type, you use it and you might embarrass yourself a lot
[02:10:26] <bookworm> my problem is that the shitty software is not working as gboard doesn't work very well if you have two languages configured
[02:11:02] <bookworm> else if you are setup with pure English stuff the automatic swipe over typing is actually not that bad nowdays
[02:11:04] <Baphomet> bookworm: I know that pain, but I figured out a way for me, I can't  remember how
[02:11:10] <bookworm> I just don't want to constantly flip between languages
[02:11:39] <Baphomet> Ohhhh, okay, in that case you're screwed LOL
[02:12:13] <Baphomet> I prefer to switch, I think that's how I solved the issue actually 
[02:12:45] <bookworm> the lag is too high... 
[02:13:12] <bookworm> I tend to communicate a lot in English, but my native language for the usual local communication
[02:13:15] <Baphomet> Well, if you count the extra time to type it might not be
[02:13:16] <bookworm> and they tend to interleave
[02:13:22] <bookworm> maybe
[02:13:35] <Baphomet> bookworm: mind if I ask your native language?
[02:13:54] <bookworm> but that also involves a switch of the keyboard layout and my muscle memory definitely can't cope with that
[02:14:00] <bookworm> Swiss German
[02:14:22] <Baphomet> As I was just guessing when you told they tend to interleave
[02:15:08] <Baphomet> But it could have been other germanic languages, I think swedish also has quite similar words
[02:15:45] <bookworm> I'm not sure I follow
[02:15:54] <bookworm> interleave is an English word last I checked :P
[02:17:25] <Baphomet> Maybe I have a poor understanding of the word interleave... When you told that I thought you were talking about words mixing up, i.e. you type an english word and it suggests a german one
[02:17:50] <bookworm> nah, I tend to flip between English and German quite a lot
[02:18:01] <bookworm> as in, the language usage is interleaved
[02:18:26] <Baphomet> Ohhhh, code switching/shifting
[02:18:37] <Baphomet> Now I got it
[02:20:35] <Baphomet> Ohhhh, no, mistaken again, now I think you mean when you are, i.e., in a conversation with one swiss german speakr and another with an english speaker at the same time
[02:20:59] <bookworm> yes
[02:22:06] <Baphomet> I see... I do that a lot too
[02:24:48] <Baphomet> I find it very interesting how Switzerland has 3 or 4 languages widely spoken 
[02:24:57] <bookworm> 3
[02:25:11] <bookworm> the 4th is dying or dead, depending on whom you ask
[02:25:20] <bookworm> (which is a pitty)
[02:25:34] <Baphomet> Always a language dies is a pity 
[02:25:50] <bookworm> Except French, French should go to hell
[02:26:11] <bookworm> look here's a grammar rule and here's the 2M exceptions
[02:26:23] <bookworm> for *every* *single* *rule*
[02:26:33] <Baphomet> Today there are more than 300 languages spoken in Brazil (besides some immigration languages), but except for portuguese none of them is widely spoken and most of them are dying 
[02:26:58] <Baphomet> bookworm: French has a strong prescriptivist culture
[02:27:11] <Baphomet> That's why I agree with you, French should die LOL
[02:27:58] * bookworm was burned in school
[02:28:09] <bookworm> by now I can't speak more than a few words though
[02:28:17] <bookworm> eventually my brain settled on English
[02:28:20] <Baphomet> Actually, explode the French Academy and problem solved in a short time
[02:28:44] <bookworm> it's the lingua franca anyhow, anything else is relatively pointless
[02:28:58] <bookworm> I don't need to speak a persons native language, just a common one
[02:29:03] <bookworm> English suits this just fine
[02:30:32] <Baphomet> English is fine, simple (of course simplicity always depends on your L1, but I came from a latin family language and I just learned fine)
[02:31:26] <Baphomet> And I can't fail to notice that they do not have a way too much prescriptivist culture like French, or Portuguese
[02:32:19] <Activ8> dear me - you lot been chatty for once, come back on here and there was 500 unread in offtopic
[02:32:39] <Baphomet> People in literature tend to hold this shitty view that rules are a matter of "right" and "wrong", and that's what makes French so annoying sometimes
[02:32:51] <bookworm> yeah
[02:33:09] <Baphomet> Activ8: there are very nice people here 
[02:33:52] <Activ8> I just re-read all of the missed chat, interesting read
[02:35:11] <Activ8> hey xnaas you running that kb on github
[02:35:21] <Activ8> with github pages?
[02:35:41] <Baphomet> Activ8: thanks for asking, I was gonna ask but I forgot 
[02:36:03] <Activ8> must be https://github.com/xnaas/kb.xnaas.info
[02:36:53] <Baphomet> That's a quite cool kb
[02:37:56] <Baphomet> Except for the aliases to make bash commands the same as windows LOL
[02:38:02] <Activ8> not liking that green though ewwww
[02:38:06] <Baphomet> (just joking, though)
[02:38:41] <Baphomet> Activ8: I kinda liked it, but I have terrible taste for colors though
[02:38:47] <Activ8> I think I might make a kb
[02:38:54] <Activ8> I made my own theme for TLC
[02:39:05] <Activ8> I have two dark and blue
[02:39:26] <Baphomet> I've been wanting to make it for years, I felt like creating a wiki or something of sort
[02:39:31] <Baphomet> But never did
[02:40:10] <Activ8> thelounge-theme-flat-blue and thelounge-theme-flat-dark
[02:40:14] <Activ8> on npm
[02:41:36] <Baphomet> I'll take a look, but honestly while I love those colors in a website I would be for a couple of minutes, I don't love that much on something I'm using for a long time, specially dark screens 
[02:42:03] <Activ8> yeh
[02:42:14] <Activ8> I use dark theme all the time 
[02:42:34] <Baphomet> I tend to prefer a less illuminated environment (for I'm autistic and have light hypersensitivity), and if I'm in the dark and use a dark theme that's kinda depressing 
[02:43:54] <Activ8> I don't feel the same since the theme has light usernames
[02:44:06] <Activ8> so it's still colorful
[02:45:26] <Activ8> im loving this status page - https://status.xnaas.info/
[02:45:48] <Baphomet> xnaas: is that status related to the server of yours you were talking about?
[02:47:11] <Activ8> looks like it
[02:47:14] <xnaas> Activ8: the source code is on github, but you're getting the files served to you from my server box :)
[02:47:18] <xnaas> upptime is far from perfect
[02:47:28] <xnaas> it had a lot of false downtime notifications today for one of my sites but not the other
[02:47:30] <xnaas> on the same box...
[02:47:32] <xnaas> :/
[02:47:35] <Activ8> aw
[02:47:41] <xnaas> but overall it's decent
[02:47:42] <Baphomet> I just now noticed the footer of the page, he uses mkdocs 
[02:47:48] <xnaas> mkdocs ftw
[02:48:05] <Activ8> what is mkdocs wrote in
[02:48:12] <Activ8> is it python or summit else
[02:48:19] <xnaas> python
[02:48:39] <Baphomet> I'm gonna follow your gh xnaas, if you don't find it creepy 
[02:48:46] <xnaas> do whatever you want
[02:48:50] <xnaas> show up at my house and let's fuck too
[02:48:51] <xnaas> idc
[02:51:36] <Activ8> now that's creepy lol
[02:52:42] * xnaas just likes taking things too far
[02:52:43] <xnaas> :P
[02:52:56] <Activ8> ha ha
[02:52:57] <xnaas> but yeah, Id idn't even know github had a follow feature until someone randomly followed me once
[02:53:00] <xnaas> never used it myself
[02:53:03] <xnaas> don't see any point lol
[02:53:18] <Activ8> you get updates if you follow someone
[02:53:35] <Activ8> it's like a facebook scroll page lol
[02:53:41] <bookworm> I get that you want to follow certain repos... people not so much
[02:54:14] <Activ8> i follow repos not people
