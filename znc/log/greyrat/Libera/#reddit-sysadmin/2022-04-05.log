[08:25:06] <yuken> @jay-ros there is no quick-release on the chain that I saw.
[08:25:11] <yuken> I have to push the pin back in.,
[08:25:12] <Kiernian> I feel like I'm missing part of a conversation here, but I don't 
[08:25:15] <Kiernian> or not
[08:25:26] <jay-ros> Kiernan, he's got a bike chain which he's installing
[08:25:28] <yuken> It's a very tight tolerance hole and a flat-faced cylinder, so I can't get it in properly to use a mallet.
[08:25:37] <jay-ros> yeah you don't smack it!
[08:25:38] <yuken> so if I can file a point to get it to sit, so I can mallet it in...
[08:25:40] <jay-ros> it's a compression
[08:25:48] <yuken> wat
[08:26:09] <jay-ros> hahha don't whack the thing!!
[08:26:55] <jay-ros> https://youtu.be/BFSswG_Mtu0?t=317
[08:27:01] <jay-ros> you use a squeezy boi for it
[08:27:16] <yuken> jay-ros, I don't have a new pin to install.
[08:27:24] <yuken> I'm trying to get an existing pin back in to the chain.
[08:27:37] <jay-ros> yeah you can use the same pin, if you've removed it properly
[08:27:47] <yuken> I have. But I can't, no.
[08:27:48] <yuken> That's the problem.
[08:27:56] <yuken> It's a flat-faced cylinder. It won't stay in.
[08:28:01] <yuken> Because I don't have 4 hands.
[08:28:34] <jay-ros> oh the pushbike chains have a different pin than I've got on my bikes
[08:28:50] <jay-ros> it's a one time use snap off one
[08:29:00] <yuken> I know. I don't have that.
[08:29:03] <yuken> I'm not going to buy one, either.
[08:29:05] <yuken> I'm reusing the existing pin.
[08:29:21] <jay-ros> either way, it's not concussive application
[08:29:33] <yuken> I have a chain tool, too.
[08:29:34] <jay-ros> you gotta squeeze that bad boy in
[08:29:37] <yuken> Yes. I can't do that.
[08:29:43] <yuken> That's the problem.
[08:29:58] <jay-ros> then it probably won't hold if you manage to get it in then :D
[08:30:05] <jay-ros> it's not sitting in the hole, it's hugging the edges
[08:30:05] <yuken> ... it will.
[08:30:16] <jay-ros> you gonna locktite it or something?
[08:30:17] <yuken> I know how a chain pin works, jay-ros.
[08:30:26] <jay-ros> says the guy with a mallet :P
[08:30:28] <yuken> I can't get the pin aligned.
[08:30:32] <yuken> And stay aligned. While using my tool.
[08:30:35] <yuken> Because I have 2 hands, not 4.
[08:30:47] <Kiernian> well, fucking grow a pair!
[08:30:49] <Kiernian> :P
[08:30:54] <jay-ros> use your feet
[08:31:12] <yuken> I think I'll just use a file and get a point on one side.
[08:31:38] <jay-ros> I don't know how you're going to accomplish it, but I feel like you're going to blow the engine on your pushbike
[08:31:43] <jay-ros> even if it doesn't have one
[08:31:47] <yuken> wat
[08:31:48] <yuken> lol
[08:32:01] <Kiernian> I feel like filing it down will guarantee it doesn't stay in once put there
[08:32:27] <jay-ros> "the thing that was in place properly before is now too wide"
[08:32:30] <Kiernian> find something to substitute for the missing two hands that can hold it in place instead, maybe. 
[08:32:40] <yuken> jay-ros, it's friction-fit, yes. It would fit if I could get it aligned.
[08:32:43] <Kiernian> nail some spikes to a sheet of plywood or something
[08:32:45] <yuken> Without a point, I can't get it aligned properly.

[08:35:04] <jay-ros> some tape and cardboard shunts will do it too

[08:39:51] <yuken> DrGibbysWifi, once I prime & bottle... is it harmful to burp every few days? Last time I last it sit and all the sugar go, so much pressure that I may have blinded myself if I had my face over it.
[08:40:09] <DrGibbysWifi> stop burping your bottles dude
[08:40:18] <DrGibbysWifi> bottle it once its ready
[08:40:24] <yuken> I haven't, lol
[08:40:27] <yuken> I was wondering if it's okay to do.
[08:40:40] <DrGibbysWifi> well, once its ready, bottle it, and leave it alone
[08:40:59] <yuken> Guess I'll just have to fine-tune sugar amounts for pressure then.
[08:41:03] <DrGibbysWifi> once its carb'd, throw it in the fridge, let it cool, and drink them
[08:41:23] <DrGibbysWifi> ...
[08:41:33] <DrGibbysWifi> you dont fine tune sugars to pressure... 
[08:41:55] <yuken> DrGibbysWifi, okay. But the pressure was so high that the cap ednted my ceiling.
[08:42:06] <DrGibbysWifi> well, you didn't math right
[08:42:47] <DrGibbysWifi> there are literal calculators out there for this shit. Winging it is what gets you bottlebombs
[08:43:00] <DrGibbysWifi> we're having the exact same discussion we had several months ago 
[08:44:31] <DrGibbysWifi> and, to that point, now you want to make a 20gal batch when you can't make a 5 gal?

[08:47:05] <DrGibbysWifi> ideally you should also maintain the same yeast culture from batch to batch as well
[08:47:53] <yuken> How difficult is it for an active yeast culture to get infected here, DrGibbysWifi? I assume very.
[08:47:58] <yuken> unless I do stupid shit.
[08:48:40] <DrGibbysWifi> It's very easy to a yeast culture to get infected 
[08:48:51] <yuken> Dayum.

[08:49:10] <yuken> I have an area with still air, DrGibbysWifi. Mask, gloves, lysol everything, do it in there, probably.

[08:52:36] <SirSceptalot> what's yuken doing this time?

[08:53:06] <DrGibbysWifi> yuken, StarSan is cheap, order a bottle
[08:53:46] <yuken> That ain't too bad, DrGibbysWifi. I will for my next batch.
[08:54:01] <DrGibbysWifi> and PLEASE read the fucking instructions before you use it
[08:54:04] <yuken> I've already started another, identical to my last one. Same culture, sugar, apple juice, etc.
[08:54:11] <Kiernian> yeah, and despite the fact that the internet says 0.x% bleach + 0.x% white vinegar is a functional no-rinse sanitizer, it's not without an aftertaste, don't use it.

[08:55:57] <JollyRgrs> that's your opinion... doesn't mean it is right

[12:09:25] <Hunterkll> Thatâ€™s normally to my knowledge required for a lot of things â€“ I had to request and install a web server certificate into the machine store in order to have a usable cert with server authentication on multiple servers in order for TLS mutual authentication to work between application instances (that are using the local machine cert) and for some database access issues to resolve.

[22:23:16] <shakygator> PattyCakes - you around?
[22:23:40] <PattyCakes> hola
[22:23:51] <shakygator> yo, you use helm?
[22:24:02] <PattyCakes> maybe
[22:24:05] <Arlion> yeah
[22:24:26] <shakygator> i have some old resources created with not-helm and im trying to figure out best way to adopt/import them into charts
[22:24:32] <Jaelae> hey running into a real stupid, and likely simple issue on a centos server. i want to setup a backup folder for SFTP connections. I set it up but get connection errors when I try to authenticate. 
[22:24:33] <shakygator> so i can migrate to release charts instead
[22:24:40] <Jaelae> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/XoCEL238/
[22:25:06] <shakygator> i see i can add annotations/labels - but then what?
[22:25:55] <Arlion> every helm install or upgrade that is performed will recreate the replicaset under the same deployment. So migrating should be as easy as, installing the new resources and moving the ingress point to the new release
[22:26:01] <Arlion> ideally in a new namespace.
[22:26:18] <PattyCakes> shakygator 3 way merge? https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/7649
[22:26:18] <vinrock> trying to login as 'backup'?
[22:26:30] <Arlion> * not recreate, but instead create a new replicaset
[22:26:51] <shakygator> Arlion, in this case im trying to move nginx ingress, clusterautoscaler, and an NFS provisioner
[22:27:07] <Arlion> move ingress to what?
[22:27:12] <shakygator> to helm managed
[22:27:21] <Arlion> you want the ingress controller to be helm managed too?
[22:27:29] <shakygator> b/c when i upgrade EKS i have to manually do all upgrades
[22:27:29] <shakygator> yes
[22:27:34] <Arlion> oooooooo
[22:27:38] <Arlion> EKS shit
[22:27:39] <Arlion> nvm
[22:27:56] <PattyCakes> Jaelae post error
[22:27:56] <shakygator> also cuz im using this utility pluto to check deprecated APIs, and its easier to do that when everything is in helm releases
[22:28:09] <shakygator> this isnt really EKS specific, k8s is the one deprecating APIs
[22:28:15] <shakygator> aka v1beta going to v1, etc
[22:28:27] <PattyCakes> shakygator that's why they pay us lol. The 3 way merge, to bring things into managed helm might be what you need
[22:28:29] <Arlion> doesn't EKS provide the ingress controller?
[22:28:38] <shakygator> no?
[22:28:41] <Arlion> no?
[22:28:43] <shakygator> i had to deploy it
[22:28:44] <PattyCakes> no
[22:28:45] <shakygator> to get my ELB
[22:28:46] <Arlion> really
[22:28:49] <Arlion> huh
[22:28:49] <PattyCakes> seriously
[22:28:59] <PattyCakes> you *can* set ingreses to ALBs
[22:29:11] <PattyCakes> but it's not very expandable
[22:29:24] <shakygator> the app we have deployed can deploy the ingress, but thats now, not when we deployed it. and i dont wanna re-deploy cuz it will change ELB endpoint and then I have to engage our WAF team which sucks ass
[22:29:24] <PattyCakes> and is much easier to do the NLBs/ELBs to an nginx ingress
[22:29:27] <Jaelae> PattyCakes:  if i SSH as root then try sftp backup@localhost to test. it states: packet_write_wait: Connection to ::1 port 22: Broken pipe - Connection Closed
[22:29:42] <Arlion> Yeah, sorry. I acknowledge my knowledge isn't relevant in this case. EKS/AKS is a whole different beast.
[22:29:51] <shakygator> its just managed control plane
[22:30:04] <shakygator> you still manage (most?) resources and the worker nodes
[22:30:21] <Arlion> and the cni?
[22:30:26] <PattyCakes> is your match group properly indented Jaelae? your paste doesn't show that
[22:30:44] <PattyCakes> Arlion EKS supports all the CNIS
[22:30:44] <shakygator> i dont recall creating CNI but there is one - i think im responsible for upgrading it
[22:30:49] <Arlion> Jaelae: netstat -plutn | grep 22
[22:30:56] <shakygator> or maybe EKS upgrades it, i dont recall
[22:31:02] <PattyCakes> it does shakygator 
[22:31:05] <Arlion> are you using calico
[22:31:06] <shakygator> its on my list of things to check for deprecated apis
[22:31:10] <shakygator> i dont think so
[22:31:14] <Arlion> weave?
[22:31:17] <shakygator> we looked into that early on cuz of IP things
[22:31:29] <Arlion> flannel!
[22:31:31] <PattyCakes> you probably are using calico shakygator, it's the defaukt network backend for EKS
[22:31:32] <shakygator> cuz with EKS your worker node pulls secondary IPs so your subnets have to be big
[22:31:37] <PattyCakes> it hasn't switched to flannel
[22:31:38] <shakygator> well then yeah i guess so
[22:31:52] <shakygator> there was something, maybe some custom cni stuff, or ways to expand calico to use a private non-aws defined subnet
[22:31:58] <Arlion> Yeah, we are moving all of our existing clusters to calico right now
[22:32:04] <shakygator> similar to how the control plane uses 172.x which isnt related to your VPC
[22:32:10] <PattyCakes> ^
[22:32:40] <Arlion> oh i know what i was doing. I was making tea cause it feels like i sucked a dozen dicks last night and my throat is so sore.
[22:32:41] <PattyCakes> oh wait Jaelae, instead of using localhost try sftp backup@127.0.0.1
[22:32:51] <PattyCakes> sshd might not be listning on the ipv6 loopback
[22:33:14] <shakygator> im reading this 3 way merge thing PattyCakes 
[22:33:23] <Jaelae> same results. and i see port 22 listening hmm
[22:33:33] <PattyCakes> shakygator maybe? https://jacky-jiang.medium.com/import-existing-resources-in-helm-3-e27db11fd467
[22:33:35] <Arlion> PattyCakes: you know /etc/hosts is working because it translated localhost to ::1
[22:33:44] <shakygator> PattyCakes, does helm read context and connect to the cluster
[22:33:53] <PattyCakes> fair Arlion 
[22:34:02] <Arlion> yes
[22:34:04] <Arlion> shakygator: yes
[22:34:09] <PattyCakes> ^
[22:34:15] <Arlion> yeah, whatever context is working on your terminal is the context it uses
[22:34:21] <shakygator> yeah so i understand to add the annotation/label per that article PattyCakes but then what? do i run some command in helm or how does helm know about those things, if i dont have a matching release in helm yet?
[22:34:30] <shakygator> im assuming i need a release that it matches already
[22:34:35] <shakygator> which i do not have
[22:34:38] <Arlion> so, k get pods works, that is the context AND namespace it will use to deploy unless you specified a different namespaces in the values.yaml
[22:34:46] <shakygator> so thats what has been missing from these import articles
[22:35:12] <Arlion> shakygator: helm will install latest, you can override with the `-v` flag iirc
[22:35:14] <PattyCakes> once you set the annotatinos, shouldn't you be able to just do a helm install?
[22:35:24] <shakygator> yeah i can pick version with helm --version
[22:36:00] <shakygator> and to take it a step further, since i really wanna import these existing resources into a release, with the end goal of moving to a vendor published chart - so should i try to create a release name that matches theirs with adopted resources and then try to diff upgrade?
[22:36:23] *** Joins: redstarcomrade (uid99592@user/redstarcomrade)
[22:36:57] <Arlion> "create a release name that matches theirs" im not aware if you can do this. I've always matched my version with the upstream versioning.
[22:37:34] <shakygator> if i didnt have a WAF as a blackbox with a shit team, this wouldnt be a problem cuz id just nuke and re-create from a published chart
[22:37:50] <shakygator> which is probably the best way to approach this
[22:37:51] <Arlion> Yeah, I can understand why this would be important.
[22:38:14] <Arlion> Alright, well there is this
[22:38:45] <Arlion> you can name your release whatever you want. I GUESS if the name matches what is in `k get deployments` then it wouldn't recreate it
[22:38:59] <shakygator> okay so if i add these labels/annotations and then get releases
[22:39:06] <shakygator> will it show up with whatever release-name i added
[22:39:16] <shakygator> guess ill try
[22:39:27] <Arlion> yeah, you can set the labels and annotations in a helm values.yaml
[22:39:37] <shakygator> yeah but not that
[22:39:39] <shakygator> i meant adopting
[22:40:17] <Arlion> one sec, im going to look up something just to confirm you and i are talking about the same thing
[22:40:17] <shakygator> aka have a deployment right now not created by helm. add the app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm, then from helm get releases. if it reads from context id presume it can discover it and may "create" a release from the tag?
[22:40:31] <shakygator> i know how to feed values.yaml to a helm chart
[22:40:48] <Arlion> yeah, you are specifically asking about releases tho.
[22:41:02] <shakygator> i could be using wrong terminology
[22:41:10] <Arlion> Okay, so this what i use to install my loki cluster
[22:41:10] <shakygator> for me a release = helm deployment
[22:41:12] <Arlion> helm install loki grafana/loki-distributed -f loki-values.yaml --version 2.4.1
[22:41:17] <shakygator> release #1, #2, can rollback, etc
[22:41:22] <shakygator> yeah -f is just feeding values
[22:41:35] <Arlion> the work "loki" defines what the release name is, in k8s
[22:41:38] <shakygator> and your helm chart reads from there instead of explicitly defining in the cmd. ensures consistent and easier cmds
[22:41:42] <shakygator> ok
[22:42:00] <Arlion> so everything is prefixed with loki-loki-pod-<purpose>-<random characters at the end>
[22:42:21] <shakygator> so im thinking, say if ingress-nginx is a release name - i adopt my existing nginx stuff into a release called the same. then later i helm diff upgrade ingress-nginx
[22:42:58] <Arlion> yeah, im afraid if one thing is off, helm will do what helm will do, and destroy your old deployment, rs, and pods and deploy a new one.
[22:43:09] <Arlion> which makes rolling back, impossible
[22:43:22] <shakygator> right. pretty sure diff shows you what it will destroy/create/update like terraform does
[22:43:36] <shakygator> there is also --dry-run
[22:43:37] <Arlion> and with something as sensitive as ingress controller will surely result in extended downtime.
[22:43:42] <Arlion> oh true true true
[22:43:48] <shakygator> well good thing this is also a sandbox
[22:43:51] <shakygator> for this exact reason
[22:44:27] <shakygator> maybe i should start a blog
[22:44:45] <Arlion> yeah dude. After talking with you. I'm going with, make new cluster and migrate over to.
[22:45:00] <Arlion> You want a fail back if this doesn't go *perfect*
[22:45:50] <shakygator> ill know how it behaves from my sandbox
[22:46:05] <shakygator> but worst case in prod i can always have waf team update stuff, that team just sucks and their SLA can be weeks

[22:48:40] <shakygator> best way to learn IMO
[22:48:50] <Arlion> I'm actually thought about streaming me and doing this type of stuff live.
[22:48:57] <shakygator> im new to helm so maybe i dont understand how it works enough yet

[22:49:27] <Arlion> streaming would be after hours.

[22:56:16] <shakygator> Arlion, i wonder if this actually adopts things by creating the YAML in the chart - or if the part i am missing is i need to create a chart and add the labels. i think thats what i gotta do cuz it will be like "yeah we installed all this already'
[22:56:19] <sd_> 08<Gâ€‹ene> they create an A record for the root domain pointing towards a web service
[22:56:20] <sd_> 08<Gâ€‹ene> 0.o
[22:56:27] <fritzwastaken> o.0
[22:56:43] <sd_> 08<Gâ€‹ene> oh, i see, they have a different domain
[22:56:44] <sd_> 08<Gâ€‹ene> rip
[22:56:58] <shakygator> dns fuckery
[22:57:02] <sd_> 08<Gâ€‹ene> nah, its fine
[22:57:06] <sd_> 08<Gâ€‹ene> nvm, im a big dummy
[22:57:13] <Arlion> shakygator: what is the thing you are talking about
[22:57:17] <Arlion> shakygator: helm?
[22:57:22] <fritzwastaken> !dns
[22:57:22] <DoTheNeedful> It's Always DNS.
[22:57:25] <Arlion> !dns
[22:57:25] <shakygator> ingress-nginx is the thing
[22:57:25] <DoTheNeedful> It's Always DNS.
[22:58:05] <Arlion> shakygator: uhh... ingress nginx just does vhost routing to a gateway service
[22:58:08] <shakygator> i think i have to do 3 things. create chart that matches what i have deployed. add labels/annotations to all the deployed things. then do like you said iearlier and do helm install thing mychart
[22:58:09] <Arlion> shakygator: right?
[22:58:09] <sd_> 08<Gâ€‹ene> companyProduct.com vs company.com - ðŸ™‚
[22:58:22] <shakygator> yeah i dont care *what it does* i just need it managed by helm
[22:58:34] <Arlion> yeah yeah
[22:58:39] <sd_> 08<Gâ€‹ene> but like for windows AD domains, you can't change your root domain records, they *NEED* to resolve to domain controllers
[22:58:42] *** Joins: wolfshappen (~waff@irc.furworks.de)
[22:58:52] <shakygator> Arlion, most of this is likely just cuz i dont understand helm fully yet. new to that
[22:58:57] <sd_> 08<Gâ€‹ene> for a second, i thought this happened.
[22:58:59] <shakygator> so im having lots of ah ha moments
[22:59:10] <Arlion> shakygator: and now that i think about it, when you have a config file. it will create a new configmap and will redeploy the service.
[22:59:18] <Arlion> or secrets 
[22:59:29] <Arlion> or anything, all those will be deployed fresh
[22:59:59] <shakygator> i dont think so
[23:00:07] <shakygator> so long as the config match, and there are no reasons to destroy/recreate
[23:00:11] <shakygator> but idk, will see
[23:00:15] <Arlion> and the name of the configmap
[23:00:28] <PattyCakes> "starting to knock more than a small-town sheriff's department"
[23:00:47] <PattyCakes> 10/10 just rolled into the shop
[23:01:02] <Arlion> and even if the spacing is different
[23:01:08] <Arlion> a new configmap will be generated
[23:01:21] <Arlion> idk, this seems like a hot mess
[23:01:31] <Arlion> and im the king of hotmesses
[23:02:39] <shakygator> i mean this seems pretty normal
[23:02:46] <shakygator> ofc any new apps i deploy ill start with all charts
[23:03:07] <shakygator> but i wouldnt say its that unique to have to migrate existing apps into helm managed charts

[23:19:51] <vinrock> went to the dealership yesterday for service, need tires so got their price on em
[23:20:07] <vinrock> also got a coupon, buy 3 get 1 free
[23:20:15] <vinrock> which is bullshit, mas amount is $200
[23:20:17] <vinrock> max
[23:20:19] <shakygator> they only oversold you by 33% then
[23:20:30] <vinrock> so the ealership in the end is charging $500 more for a set than I can get em on tire rack
[23:20:44] <shakygator> s/deal/steal/
[23:20:44] <layer8> vinrock meant: "went to the stealership yesterday for service, need tires so got their price on em"
[23:21:00] <vinrock> yeah i never bought tires from the dalership so i figured id see what they want for em
[23:21:04] <vinrock> lolyeah no thanks
