[20:00:08] <ichdasich> hrm, i have a problem with recipient delimiters; i have an alias user@dom1.com -> user@dom2.com; When i know receive a mail to user+delimiter@dom1.com, this expands (correctly) to user@dom2.com.
[20:00:52] <ichdasich> problem is that now the delivered-to header in lmtp is set to user@dom2.com, which breaks some sieve filters for me.
[20:01:12] <ichdasich> s/delivered-to header/rcpt-to/
[20:01:49] <ichdasich> i could make dovecot look at delivered-to instead, but that breaks other aliases of the form 'test@dom1.com -> user+test@dom1.com'
[20:02:49] <ichdasich> is there some config option with delimiter expansion i am missing, or will i have to craft a smart sql query to make the +delimiter show up in the expanded alias as well?
[20:03:36] <ichdasich> .oO( technically, smtpd does the right thing here, i'd say. it is just that i migrated this form a postfix setup of 10+ years which always showed this behavior, and i kind of grew acustomed to it... )
