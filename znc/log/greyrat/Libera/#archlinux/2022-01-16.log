[12:37:32] <sunyibo> does SHA-hashing take account of diverging file names?

[12:41:13] <mpan> sunyibo: hash functions are taking a stream of data, which you feed to them, as the input. That’s the only thing they care about. So the answer to your question is: depends on what you yourself are feeding them. More at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function>.

[12:42:41] <mpan> Of course sheep’s question remains valid, as term “file names” do not naturally come anywhere near hash functions, so it suggests you have something specific in mind.

[12:48:46] <ramblebamble> sunyibo as a concrete example, a commit-hash in git takes the time into account git-hash-object only really cares about the content as it describes blobs, a git-tree-object also knows about file names.
[12:49:40] <mpan> Though note that this is because git itself builds a set of data, that contains file names, and then feeds it to the hash function. So it’s git’s doing, not SHA’s.
[12:50:15] <mpan> Therefore… please, answer sheep’s question.
[12:50:31] <ramblebamble> mpan, yes but it feeds different data to the hash-function as sheep and you pointed out, I just ment to give a concrete example ;)
[12:50:57] <mpan> ramblebamble: I am not saying you are wrong. Just clarifying that the names are not magically taken in by the function itself.

[12:51:26] <mpan> Since sunyibo still didn’t answer the question, that might’ve been misinterpreted this way, depending what they actually ask about. :)

[14:51:11] <magnus1> hey! im trying to install a 2nd kernel (linux-zen) in my arch system. So i can have both linux and linux-zen kernels. My bootloader is refind. I see that after "pacman -Sy linux-zen", the new kernel and initramfs are placed into /boot as expected. When i reboot, refind correctly finds the kernel and i can boot it. But I always end up at a rescue shell for the linux-zen kernel and my keyboard
[14:51:13] <magnus1> doesn't work. It's almost as if the initramfs image doesnt contain all the stuff it needs to. I found that the linux-zen package installs a mkinitcpio config into /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux-zen.preset .. but I also notice the initramfs.img file for linux-zen is a few hundred kb smaller than the standard one (for linux kernel). Anyone encountered problems like this?

[23:54:52] <th0rne> What does your server do?
[23:54:54] <evilop> like you should even if you eg were running debian
[23:55:09] <Abdullah> uuidNuni1: like your kernel
[23:55:15] <evilop> (assuming the server is doing something actually important)
[23:55:16] <NetSysFire> oooh burn
[23:55:21] <th0rne> :D
[23:55:55] <uuidNuni1> i've been running arch on servers for the past 4 years 
[23:56:08] <uuidNuni1> most of my servers. 
[23:56:08] <th0rne> Servers that do what?
[23:56:09] <jonathon> i also don't understand the need for uptime on a server - reboots should take less than a minute, and if that minute of downtime is a problem then you'd already have some sort of HA/failover in place
[23:56:49] <Namarrgon> disabling ssh host verification is a stupid idea as well, it certainly does not increase security
[23:56:57] <evilop> unless you buy supermicron, then you are looking at 5+ mins
[23:57:18] <evilop> (which still doesn't matter for most use cases=
[23:57:31] <uuidNuni1> my arm arch boots in 20 seconds. my x86_64 arch boots in 10s

[23:59:46] <th0rne> So you're saying that 10 seconds of downtime is a problem for you, but that you have no failover and thus can't reboot?
[23:59:48] <uuidNuni1> th0rne: my server hosts blogs, irc and cron jobs, a bot
