[11:00:23] <glizzster[m]1> wtf>
[11:16:19] <pystardust> glizzster[m]1: ?
[11:18:28] <iamak[m]> pystardust: Hey sorry for bothering you again. The notification thing is still not working. I set it that day with `DISPLAY=:0` and `XAUTHORITY=$HOME/.Xauthority` (by seeing some answers on stackoverflow) but the notification isn't working. I have added a line to append the time the script was triggered to a file so I know that the script is being triggered but idk why the `notify-send` part is not working.
[11:19:14] <pystardust> iamak[m]: which user is triggering the script?
[11:19:30] <iamak[m]> How do I check that?
[11:19:38] <pystardust> show ur udev rule
[11:20:18] <iamak[m]> `ENV{POWER_SUPPLY_NAME}=="BAT0", ACTION=="change", SUBSYSTEM=="power_supply", RUN+="/usr/bin/bash /home/ak/startup/battchange.sh"`
[11:20:38] <pystardust> so ur running as root, but xorg is started as user
[11:20:56] <pystardust> run the command as ur user using the su method I showed
[11:21:06] <iamak[m]> su -c?
[11:21:30] <pystardust> SUBSYSTEM=="power_supply", ENV{POWER_SUPPLY_NAME}=="ACAD", ACTION=="change", RUN+="/usr/bin/su -c '/home/harshith/.local/bin/udevrules/ac.sh' -s /bin/sh harshith"
[11:21:58] <iamak[m]> 1 min I will try
[11:22:30] <iamak[m]> `ac.sh` is your script?
[11:22:39] <pystardust> I don't directly send notification. I have a script that runs as a user which accepts signals, and ac.sh just signals that script
[11:23:12] <pystardust> yeah ac.sh is the script
[11:23:20] <iamak[m]> Ok so mine should be `/usr/bin/su -c '/home/ak/startup/battchange.sh' -s /bin/sh ak`?
[11:23:48] <pystardust> yes, try running that command as a root user (with out udev) for testing
[11:23:54] <iamak[m]> Ok
[11:32:04] <iamak[m]> It says script failed
[11:36:54] <pystardust> iamak[m]: try a simple echo logging script and see
[11:38:35] <iamak[m]> Ok
[11:41:50] <iamak[m]> Works pystardust 
[11:42:53] <iamak[m]> But not the notify-send part
[11:55:14] <irc-open-up> pystardust: share tmux config i wanna try it out :O
[11:57:54] <klimi[m]> Gib config
[11:58:29] <iamak[m]> pystardust: fixed it. `runuser -u ak` worked.
[11:58:29] <iamak[m]> Thanks for all the help üëçÔ∏è

[17:46:09] <glizzster[m]1> i dont understand why do so many people still hate brave browser?? cuz its based on chromium or the oopsie they did in past?
[17:47:09] <Arya[m]> ‚ùØ pacman -F /usr/bin/ftp
[17:47:09] <Arya[m]> usr/bin/ftp is owned by core/inetutils 2.2-1
[17:47:12] <Arya[m]> here you go
[17:47:21] <Arya[m]> glizzster[m]1: probably
[17:47:30] <Arya[m]> and hardened ff or librewolf is better ig
[17:48:14] <glizzster[m]1> Arya[m]: yeah i would love to use hardened ff too but the only thing that stops me from using it is performance

[17:54:05] <Arya[m]> whatdym
[17:54:24] <Arya[m]> -F binary will show you which package a file belongs to
[18:10:45] <NeoVoid[m]> ok pacman's flag
[18:11:27] <NeoVoid[m]> but how you know when the binary isn't installed
[18:20:18] <Arya[m]> i didnt have it installed
[18:20:23] <Arya[m]> just put in the presumable path
[18:20:29] <Arya[m]> if its ftp
[18:20:35] <Arya[m]> its probably in /usr/bin/ftp
[18:23:11] <klimi[m]> Hm... We use some ftp server for ftp.linux.cz I could look it up if you want
