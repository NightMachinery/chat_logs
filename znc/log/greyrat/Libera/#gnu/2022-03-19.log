[00:39:36] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> lets just say I would return If hadnt to
[00:40:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> point is like previous systems current system has problems and we cannot ignore those, like with feudalism there was imense concentration of power and a big lack of liberty
[00:40:44] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> capitalism has created monopolies in most industries
[00:40:54] *** Joins: davisr (~davisr@fsf/staff/davisr)
[00:41:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> we need to adress that and so not all parts of capitalism are unsustained but the bad parts need upgrade

[00:59:45] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> is not about "intelectual freedom" whatever that means
[00:59:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> but about logical arguments
[01:00:42] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if you have any valid refutions to my points I would be happy to listen to you and revert my previous statement as incorrect isf 
[01:01:05] <isf> i dont care about logical, i respect all point of views and i respect the project of life of the others.
[01:01:24] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is a quite miopic view of reality
[01:01:28] <isf> if someone are a nazi, i dont attack him, i respect him.
[01:01:51] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if that way of thinking would have any base
[01:01:59] <isf> becouse he is a man, as i am. So, my poin of view, is here: the respect of the private property of the others.
[01:02:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> why would free software important?
[01:02:17] <isf> free software is important becouse respect the user freedoms, always 
[01:02:27] <isf> all deserve freedom.

[01:03:00] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> freedom to believe in something != forcing such believes on other people
[01:03:08] <isf> that is the respect to the life, and the respect to the project life.
[01:03:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so like I respect you believes
[01:03:18] <isf> im not forcing people to believe in what im believe.
[01:03:34] <isf> i can recommend it, but never force it becouse for me do that is a crime.
[01:03:39] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> but that doesnt mean I will not refute points I believe are illogical
[01:03:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> only with such discourse we can learn from one and other ;)

[01:04:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> isf you are commiting a huge falacy
[01:04:28] <isf> in terms of freeedom, i respect the intelectual freedom and the freedom to life. That is what the individualists like me defend
[01:04:35] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> forget about boxing up and categorization of concepts

[01:05:59] <isf> always i go to respect your project of life

[01:06:28] <isf> if you are wrong or bad from my intelectual freedom that isnt relevant, always i go to respect your intelectual freedom for believe all you want.
[01:06:31] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> sharing!=forcing
[01:06:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "inteleatual freedom" seems a irrelevant topic here
[01:07:12] <isf> never intelectual freedom and freedom to life are irrelevant
[01:07:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> given noone is forcing you to take my arguments as true
[01:07:21] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is the beauty
[01:07:23] <isf> becouse all freedoms depend of the intelectual freedom
[01:07:26] <isf> and the freedom to life
[01:07:42] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you can callout and refute other peoples nonsense without forcing it
[01:07:48] <isf> to as in software for compile you have dependencies with freedom to. And they are: Intelectual freedom and freedom to life.
[01:07:55] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> let other and yourself judge a argument for what it is
[01:08:05] <isf> i dont go to learn
[01:08:07] <isf> nothing from you
[01:08:12] <isf> thanks anyway for try it hehe

[01:08:22] <isf> sad just for you
[01:08:27] <isf> im happy with my intelectual freedom
[01:08:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> given for me to learn anything from you, first both parties need to be proven wrong at first
[01:09:08] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if that is something you dont understand
[01:09:10] <isf> i dont care about if you learn or not
[01:09:12] <isf> something about me
[01:09:14] <isf> that dont affect me
[01:09:27] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so why speak?
[01:09:35] <isf> if you run or not propietary software that dont affect me, ofcourse i go to recommend it run free software. But i dont care becouse dont affect me
[01:10:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so why do you communicate with other people that is my question?
[01:10:12] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> why havent you build gnu from scratch alone?
[01:10:19] <isf> becouse i run only free software, so in my intelectual freedom i want share that freedom to others. But i dont go to force you so, i dont care if you take my example or not, that just affect you becouse i run only free software.
[01:10:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> obviously you care if not you would just create your own templeOS ;D
[01:10:49] <isf> i dont go to take your suggerences
[01:11:06] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> isf: explain intelectual freedom
[01:11:13] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that seems a baseless consept
[01:11:24] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and given most of your arguments utilize such 
[01:11:28] <isf> intelectual freedom is freedom to believe all you want without restriction or coercion.
[01:11:35] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> for them to be valid you kinda need to explain
[01:12:17] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ok great, so so far how has anyone "itelectual freedom" been afected?
[01:12:20] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> nobody is forcing you to believe my arguments
[01:12:31] <isf> nothing here can
[01:12:41] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that also doesnt impeed me to call out your logical flaws
[01:12:51] <isf> in all the world 0 peope cant force you to change your intelectual freedom
[01:12:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and total nonsesne
[01:13:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> especially given when baseless arguments are presented
[01:13:12] <isf> intelectual freedom is something you dont win, or you cant buy ur you cant receive from others mans.
[01:13:33] <isf> you cant receive intelectual freedom from others.
[01:13:37] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you speak a lot of that but that is totally unrelated to this dscussion
[01:13:47] <isf> i dont care about it
[01:13:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> given noone is forcing you to believe you arguments are bullshit
[01:14:21] <isf> only for you
[01:14:31] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> again, obviously you care, because if not you wouldnt be here
[01:14:32] <isf> becouse maybe for other my point of view is completly moral.
[01:14:46] <isf> maybe for others your point of view is completly inmoral
[01:14:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> until you provide arguments with some base is not really "only for you"
[01:14:55] <isf> how i can recognice it?
[01:15:08] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> but more like your arguments are nonsense
[01:15:10] <isf> in terms of free software, i run only free software.
[01:15:16] <isf> what about you?
[01:15:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> has is so called "individualism"
[01:15:28] <isf> yes i believe in the individualism
[01:15:38] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "what about you?" dont try to dictrate
[01:15:41] <isf> becouse individualism defend the intelectual freedom and the freedom to life.
[01:15:50] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ego is the issue now
[01:15:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> *now=here
[01:16:01] <isf> if you feel bad for your morality about your position in free software, dont worry
[01:16:07] <isf> a lot of people here run nonfree distros too.
[01:16:27] <isf> a lot of people are doing steps in the freedom ladder to.
[01:16:27] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> nobody even reference that
[01:16:34] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so dont play games here
[01:16:39] <isf> i do all i want
[01:16:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the issue here seems to be a problem with ego
[01:16:49] <isf> becouse im not attacking your private property.
[01:16:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the inabilaty of assuming when incorrect
[01:17:10] <isf> you want censorship me?
[01:17:24] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> especially when people provide refutations to show that your arguments are baseless
[01:17:35] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> no not really,
[01:17:36] <isf> if i have or not arguments
[01:17:39] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ...
[01:17:41] <isf> that only affect me

[01:18:04] <isf> dont restrict my freedom to be wrong.
[01:18:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and until you provide eveidence for such arguments
[01:18:20] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> they will remain invalid
[01:18:22] <isf> if i say bad arguments. Exist something more normal that that?
[01:18:44] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is where you get it completely wrong
[01:18:49] <isf> if im wrong for you. that just affect you.

[01:22:29] <isf> and my ideology is based in the irrestrict defend of the project of my neigbors and the intelectual freedom and the freedom to life and the defense of the private property.
[01:22:33] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ther solution to prevent abuse/censorship and misinformation 
[01:22:42] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> is with allways being open to be proven wrong
[01:22:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> is also great because you can learn from other knowledge

[01:28:52] <isf> i dont believe
[01:28:54] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is why ego is so unproductive given the ego and the I, aka idividualism only brings unsustainable concepts to our behaviour like greed domination, delusion, deturpion etc
[01:28:55] <isf> what you believe
[01:29:04] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> is not about beliving

[01:30:27] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I could also state the nazi regime or the american empire never killed anyone
[01:30:42] <isf> kill mans are a crime.
[01:30:52] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> but that doesnt make it like all the suffering and killed people all of a suden disappear
[01:31:02] <isf> always a crime are gainst the individual, becouse a crime is the attack against the private property.
[01:31:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the point is you need to reject ego and allways be open to be proven wrong

[01:33:38] <isf> nature for me is just a creation. No a mother like maybe is for you 
[01:33:42] <isf> not for me
[01:33:45] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> and there parts to such systems
[01:33:50] <isf> all your "trues" for me arent.
[01:33:56] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> a individual view on such doesn not work
[01:34:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I never state it was a mother
[01:34:13] <isf> i dont care if for you 100+100 are 200. If i believe something different i have intelectual freedom to do it.
[01:34:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so please dont bring preconcept and manipulation to the discussion
[01:34:42] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> again "intelectual freedom to do it." does not matter here
[01:34:54] <isf> thats my argument for believe in all i waant without restrictions. (if arent a attack against the private property)
[01:35:00] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> what matters is that your arguments are baseless so far
[01:35:02] <isf> you are a nazi?
[01:35:09] <isf> you  believe is good restric the intelectual freedom?
[01:35:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you missing the point
[01:35:21] <isf> becouse you are attacking  my intelectual freedom right now.
[01:35:31] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> without the freedom you like so much to be proven wrong
[01:35:34] <isf> saying "you are bad, thats not tru"
[01:35:36] <isf> true*
[01:35:41] <isf> let me believe i want believe.
[01:35:44] <isf> dont be a nazi
[01:35:46] <isf> please.
[01:35:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you face the danger of yourself forcing your ideas on others
[01:35:49] <isf> colectivist guy
[01:36:00] <isf> colectivist guy, please dont force me to change my mind D:
[01:36:09] <isf> i want believe what  i want
[01:36:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you deception is not working
[01:36:17] <isf> the best way i can do
[01:36:19] <isf> today
[01:36:22] <isf> is block you
[01:36:24] <isf> bye
[01:36:30] <isf> ignored
[01:36:33] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> for the 5th time caling out your unbased arguments

[01:37:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> isf: the sad part of this is when you face the moment of someone proving you wrong
[01:37:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> instead of understanding why that is and maybe counter argue you keep on this loop
[01:38:00] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> of inaceptance I would even say delusion
[01:38:08] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> where you cant accept it
[01:38:16] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> this is just a ego problem has stated before
[01:38:42] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> again my presenting valid refutations to your point!= forcing my views on you
[01:38:54] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is for you to analyse and counterarguee
[01:39:16] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> but even if that single step is not understood why then speak really
[01:40:14] <corwin> I have days where I think "dang, I type way too much into the internet. I'm probably bugging people".  Then again, some days make me feel like "naw, you're fine".
[01:40:19] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if you speak means you are interested, and if you are interested then you need to be open to be proven wrong at alltimes
[01:41:55] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is my only point here isf 
[01:42:18] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> no itention to "censor" "ban" or any other nonsense you aclaimed
[01:42:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> :D
[01:42:31] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> No worries though
[01:44:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I think you will understand my point in time
[01:45:08] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if not happy to hear based refutations for such ;)
