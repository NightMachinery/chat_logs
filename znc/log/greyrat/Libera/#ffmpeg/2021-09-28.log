[01:18:33] <CCHyper> Hi! Hopfully someone will be able to assit me with my questions;
[01:18:53] <mythos> never!
[01:19:12] <CCHyper> Oops, pressed enter too early!
[01:20:12] <CCHyper> I'm trying to use ffmpeg as a replacement video player for a old PC game. I am looking at using the source of ffplay first of all as a base, but I limited to 16bit colour depth and DirectDraw.
[01:20:34] <CCHyper> Is it possible to let ffmpeg do its thing and obtain the raw frame data which I can copy to the DirectDraw surface?
[01:20:58] <CCHyper> I'm currently looking at av_image_copy_to_buffer and trying to see if it will do what I need.
[01:21:31] <JEEB> I think there's also a get_buffer(2) thing which lets you provide the buffer to which the decoder will write?
[01:21:46] <JEEB> you of course still need to follow the rules of providing enough padding etc
[01:23:10] <CCHyper> I'm quite very new to ffmpeg from a development approach, is using ffplay a good base for me to use? I only need scaling (say, video is 1920x1080 and target surface is 1280x720).

[01:24:04] <JEEB> for for scaling you have a choice of swscale and libavfilter's vf_scale
[01:24:21] <JEEB> both now (in master) have AVFrame based interfaces
[01:24:32] <JEEB> while previously swscale only dealt with buffers
[01:24:44] <CCHyper> Yeah, swscale is in ffplay and I am using that in my code currently.

[01:25:21] <CCHyper> I have it doing; avcodec_decode_video2 -> sws_scale -> av_image_copy_to_buffer, then hope to copy to the DirectDraw surface there.
[01:25:51] <JEEB> why is there an extra copy between the swscale and copy to ddraw?
[01:26:19] <CCHyper> Honestly not too sure, just following what info I can find online at the moment lol
[01:26:38] <CCHyper> As the target surface is 16bit, I'm creating a RGB565 frame buffer which I believe I need to do a second copy to?

[13:58:54] <roxlu> So I have to upload the decoded frames into the `buffersrc` filter using `hwupload` if I'm correct
[13:59:12] <roxlu> But currently I get: `[hwupload @ 0x7f3f68003b80] A hardware device reference is required to upload frames to.`
[14:00:30] <roxlu> When I look at line 1049, https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/3.4/ffmpeg__filter_8c_source.html I see that the hardware context is set by iterating over the filters. This is how the ffmpeg util does it for 3.4, 4.x has a similar solution.

[14:03:19] <Silicium> not a ffmpeg question but rtsp. i'am streaming RTSP from behind a NAT, therefore its fallback to TCP. this causes 2 seconds latency to the stream which i want to get rid of.

[18:26:08] <Guest75> Hi, we are using python ffmpeg for video transcoding. The setup is running on kubernetes. But unfortunately ffmpeg consumes high cpu and is causing liveness probe failures thereby causing restarts.

[18:28:27] <kepstin> sounds like a provisioning issue. video encoding in particular can use as much resources as you can give it (up to a point) and often uses more memory than people expect.
[18:28:31] <Guest75> What is a good approach towards solving this? Setting nice parameter to lower the priority of ffmpeg against the spawning python process or using -threads option
[18:29:20] <Guest75> kepstin in our case memory is not much used. cpu limits are breached causing throttling
[18:29:55] <kepstin> well, then remove those cpu limits? you want as much cpu as possible for encoding.

[18:31:03] <kepstin> and yeah, depending on how the environment is set up and the encoder in use you might want to manually limit the threads - it's possible the encoder might detect the cpu count of the host system instead of available cores in the container, in some cases.

[19:12:29] <Manouchehri> This is gonna come across as stupid, but for transcoding purposes, are rawvideo (uncompressed), vp9 lossless, av1 lossless, x265 lossless, and x264 lossless all 100% the same in practice? I thought was HEVC is probably the best, since it has a wide range of hardware acceleration support, and supports HDR a little better in practice over H.264.

[19:14:27] <Manouchehri> JEEB: basically for archiving and for uploading to crappy web platforms that are gonna compress the crap out of it. I figure it makes sense to give them the max possible bitrate in hopes it helps a little :P
[19:14:42] <fiskfan1999> good point
[19:15:05] <JEEB> I'd generally go for max compressed lossless, something like ffv1 or x264's H.264. after all, since it's going to get re-encoded the lack of HWdec support really doesn't matter
[19:15:06] <Manouchehri> fiskfan1999: mhm, that way I'm not introducing any compression artifacts that are gonna be compounded.
[19:15:09] <fiskfan1999> have you done side-by-side tests of the same video to compare file-size?

[19:31:25] <another|> You think that will introduce more error than downscaling and encoding?
[19:31:33] <JEEB> another|: for lossless 10bit doesn't gain
[19:31:43] <JEEB> Manouchehri: H.264 does not top out at that :D
[19:31:50] <furq> 10-bit doesn't gain very much in general in my experience
[19:31:51] <JEEB> at least not for your use case
[19:31:54] <Manouchehri> JEEB: oh. Darn wikipedia.
[19:32:03] <another|> JEEB: possibly. haven't tried it
[19:32:26] <JEEB> Manouchehri: hw decoders might be limited, sure. but  you're not encoding for a hw decoder to enjoy your video
[19:32:41] <JEEB> you're encoding so that it gets munched by another video transcoding system
[19:32:43] <furq> hwdec won't do 4k60 anyway
[19:32:52] <JEEB> various do
[19:32:54] <Manouchehri> true
[19:32:59] <JEEB> I have encoded level 5.2 just fine
[19:33:05] <JEEB> and decoded it with hwdec
[19:33:11] <furq> which one
[19:33:39] <JEEB> in my case nvidia. and my cell phones (both qualcomms, one from 2014 another from 2019 or so)
[19:33:52] <Manouchehri> I'm leaning towards x265, because HEVC SEI messages seem to be better supported across platforms.
[19:33:54] <JEEB> also I haven't received too many complaints yet
[19:34:27] <furq> i wonder how relevant the dxva stuff is any more
[19:34:55] <JEEB> Manouchehri: if you mean the MaxFALL and mastering screen ones, guess which encoder also supports them (and since they're exactly the same SEI structure as in HEVC...)
[19:35:03] <JEEB> although sure, test with a short clip
[19:35:03] <furq> i wonder if dxva even still enforces it
[19:35:26] <JEEB> furq: usually limits in dxva2/d3d11va come from the driver
[19:35:48] <Manouchehri> JEEB: yeah, so by the spec, AVC and HEVC should have the same support, right? In practice, I feel like some applications might not be expecting to see HDR in AVC, and ignore it.
[19:35:56] <fiskfan1999> are there any lossless hw encoders? im on macos and videotoolbox doesn't have it
[19:36:09] <JEEB> Manouchehri: for end user stuff, sure. probably true.
[19:36:12] <fiskfan1999> i bet the filesizes would be horrible tho
[19:36:17] <furq> nvenc has lossless encoding
[19:36:21] <furq> the filesizes are fine
[19:36:24] <JEEB> Manouchehri: for your use case, though...
[19:36:25] <fiskfan1999> huh
[19:36:31] <furq> not good but fine
[19:36:38] <Manouchehri> JEEB: e.g. Vimeo claims that HDR must be uploaded in HEVC.
[19:36:51] <JEEB> Manouchehri: let me check
[19:36:51] <furq> expect like 20% worse than x264
[19:36:56] <furq> which is generally true for nvenc

[19:37:16] <Manouchehri> "In order to be considered Dolby Vision, your file must be delivered as HEVC-10bit, HLG, Dolby Vision 8.4."
[19:37:52] <JEEB> you went from general HDR to DoVi Profile 8.4
[19:38:11] <JEEB> and I actually went and asked an insider if they really skimped on implementing :P
[19:38:19] <JEEB> (for normal HDR)
[19:38:30] <Manouchehri> JEEB: haha yes, I'm just trying to see what's the widest amount of support for each codec in "the real world".
[19:39:14] <JEEB> also since vimeo anyways re-encodes, I'm pretty sure as long as you have those pesky RPUs
[19:39:34] <JEEB> it's still going to end up encoded as required
[19:40:14] *** Joins: ivanich (~ivanich@45-140-123-239.broadband.tenet.odessa.ua)
[19:40:57] <Manouchehri> it would be cool that if ffmpeg was told to re-encode a multitrack video, and it's re-encoding did a worse job of the filesize (for the exact same codec, resolution, and colour space), it would just take the original track instead.

[19:47:24] <fiskfan1999> btw, x265 lossless just finished the 1 minute 1440p60 video in 21 minutes and resulted in a larger filesize than x264 did in 1 minute 30 seconds xd
[19:47:35] <furq> yeah that'll happen
[19:47:43] <fiskfan1999> vp9 lossless is 19 seconds in in the same amount of time as x265 has taken so far
[19:47:55] <furq> this is why i just stick with x264 superfast
[19:48:08] <fiskfan1999> lmao
[19:48:29] <JEEB> Manouchehri: specifically if you are doing DoVi 8.4 then yes, because that is how most 8.4 content gets generated (iPhones etc), that is why that work flow is noted as HEVC only
[19:49:04] <JEEB> otherwise H.264 is preferred for SDR and HDR
