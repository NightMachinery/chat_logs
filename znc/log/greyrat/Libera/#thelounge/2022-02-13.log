[08:58:52] <FloridaMan> Drafted, but I thought I could maybe gather some early feedback if there's any to provide.
[08:59:45] <FloridaMan> The parse helper test is not playing nice and may have to be rewritten a bit (there's no direct @vue/server-test-utils for Vue 3)
[09:00:32] <FloridaMan> running into a weird "ReferenceError: document is not defined" error on those cases when I try to use `mount` from `@vue/test-utils` to mount the component to test the parsing.

[09:17:01] <FloridaMan> Thanks! The rest of the tests seem to be doing good, it's just that particular file
[09:17:19] <FloridaMan> I might need to take a look at eslint as well because I don't think it's liking the new setup

[09:18:05] <FloridaMan> Could just be me though
[09:18:30] <MaxLeiter> No, I distinctly remember having issues with template for tags or something
[09:18:48] <MaxLeiter> it would complain regardless of how you set it up and I didn't bother looking into it too much
[09:20:10] <MaxLeiter> of course vue uses discord /:

[09:21:55] <MaxLeiter> it rings better than "Discussion" 
[09:22:03] <MaxLeiter> I guess Discourse is already taken
[09:22:25] <xnaas> I think they should've been more aggressive. Maybe...Riot? 🤪
[09:22:50] <FloridaMan> Contempt
[09:22:52] <MaxLeiter> isnt riot element now
[09:22:56] <xnaas> yeah
[09:23:04] <MaxLeiter> thats... at least comparable to TL now imo I guess
[09:23:12] <xnaas> bring back Shout smh
[09:23:57] <MaxLeiter> I still think we shouldve just gone with Lounge but that ship has sailed 
[09:24:10] <MaxLeiter> because the amount of times I want to say The The Lounge is annoying
[09:24:50] <xnaas> yeah 😅
[09:25:11] <FloridaMan> No reason you can't rebrand :)
[09:25:28] <FloridaMan> Maybe not from The Lounge to Lounge though hehe

[16:29:05] <Activ8> 100% IMO go the alpine only route, I really don't know why when docker supports alpine and it's a docker image then people can run it in docker with alpine only.  Sounds perfect
[16:29:16] <Activ8> If you need some testing done once you made changes let me know

[18:12:07] <loungebeginner> hello
[18:12:21] <loungebeginner> can i install the lounge app on the PI OS?
[18:12:56] <loungebeginner> raspberry pi
[18:13:10] <val> yes
[18:19:15] <loungebeginner> how to do it val?
[18:20:47] <val> just the same as usual: https://thelounge.chat/docs/install-and-upgrade
[18:21:46] <loungebeginner> but i am running a headless pi
[18:22:04] <loungebeginner> so i dont know where and how to save the downloaded .deb setup file
[18:22:20] <loungebeginner> i am ssh - ing to the pi
[18:22:46] <val> use 'wget' to download it to the current directory
[18:23:30] <val> for example: wget https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/releases/download/v4.3.0/thelounge_4.3.0_all.deb
[18:23:44] <val> then: sudo apt install ./thelounge_4.3.0_all.deb
[18:24:33] <loungebeginner> oh thanks a ton val
[18:24:35] <loungebeginner> its happening 
[18:24:42] <loungebeginner> i didnt knew the wget command
[18:24:47] <val> :)
[18:25:45] <loungebeginner> installing now
[18:26:17] <loungebeginner> getting lots of warning
[18:26:41] <val> such as?
[18:26:59] <bookworm> cve, out of date etc... npm spams due to old versions
[18:27:20] <loungebeginner> yup
[18:27:26] <bookworm> it's better on the newest master branch but the package doesn't have that yet
[18:27:28] <loungebeginner> update
[18:27:36] <val> wut, the debian package runs npm?
[18:27:42] <bookworm> yes
[18:27:54] <bookworm> in an install script, rather hacky
[18:28:13] <bookworm> the issue is that you need to pull in the C dep in the proper version
[18:28:20] <bookworm> (sqlite3)
[18:29:14] <bookworm> and so far no pne bothered to generate the full matrix of arches and OSes
[18:30:43] <val> can't you just add a 'Depend' in d/control?
[18:31:11] <bookworm> depend on what?
[18:31:18] <loungebeginner> http://localhost:9000/ not opening 
[18:31:22] <val> the C deps
[18:31:29] <bookworm> it's a npm package
[18:32:00] <bookworm> we don't have a "proper" npm package, we use pur pinned versions and essentially shove it in a vendored package
[18:32:30] <val> loungebeginner: you need to replace 'localhost' with the raspberry's hostname
[18:32:33] <bookworm> meaning all pur deps are internal to Tl, you can't depend on things in the debian/Ubuntu repos for that
[18:33:09] <loungebeginner> i feel embarassed, how to do that val?
[18:33:17] <loungebeginner> oh wait
[18:33:41] <bookworm> and the way sqlite3 works is that it pulls in a pre conpiled binary blob from somewhere based on the current arch, if that fails (not available say) then a fallback from source build is done with a C compiler
[18:33:49] <loungebeginner> got it 
[18:34:02] <loungebeginner> sorry i thought to edit the config 
[18:36:41] <val> oh right, npm doesn't lookup what is available on the system
[18:36:44] <loungebeginner> thelounge list
[18:36:44] <loungebeginner> internal/fs/utils.js:269
[18:36:44] <loungebeginner>     throw err;
[18:36:55] <loungebeginner> i get error when i use any command

[18:44:39] <loungebeginner> i am clueless
[18:45:09] <bookworm> depends, you can ignore the error for now, but that means you'll loose quite a bit of functionality

[22:34:25] <FloridaMan> Man this test for the message parse is killing me. There's a need for us to switch to a test runner with a DOM so that we can mount components inside tests. Right now there's no browser or DOM, and the parse.js test file is highly coupled to @vue/server-test-utils, which won't work for Vue 3.

[22:36:02] <FloridaMan> That file is literally the only one failing after upgrading to Vue 3. I'd rather not try to pack an entire test framework overhaul into this PR if I can help it.
[22:36:30] <FloridaMan> We probably will have to address this if we want better frontend testing of components, however.

[22:39:20] <FloridaMan> Btw, someone tried to ignore all the test/client tests in the Mocha config prior to me starting this, but it's not recognizing that.

[23:40:11] <LitBot> [03GitHub] (14thelounge/thelounge) [issue] jisan11218 opened 13#4478: On public mode The Lounge ping timeout in like 30 seconds of inactivity. How to fix this? - https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/issues/4478

[23:45:28] <thelounge3380> on ios and android it says "Disconnected from the server (transport error), the lounge does not reconnect in public mode.
[23:45:56] <val> looks like there is a bad connection between your phone and the server
[23:46:57] <thelounge3380> sometimes it say "ping timeout, the lounge does not reconnectt in public mode."
[23:47:14] <thelounge3380> but No ping timeout on PC 
[23:48:50] <val> it really looks like a connection issue, I don't see what The Lounge can do about that.
[23:49:02] <val> hang here for a bit, other people may be able to help you
[23:49:08] <thelounge3380> Ok thanks
