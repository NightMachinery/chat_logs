[00:22:24] <ash_worksi> nginx containers need to be torn down and restarted (I think) to parse templates correctly. how so I do that with compose? I don't think `docker-compose restart` does that
[00:23:03] <ash_worksi> I mean, I can just stop it and the compose `up` again, but I wondered if there was a shortcut
[00:23:06] <tabakhase> ash_worksi up with --force-recreate ?
[00:23:22] <ash_worksi> tabakhase: does that recreate all containers?
[00:23:30] <ash_worksi> or can I specify just one?
[00:23:53] <tabakhase> "if you want" yes - therwise just the names you spec yes "docker-compose up --force-recreate web"

[01:02:47] <baldpope> I'm trying to use 'timeout' the program in alpine, to artificially limit the max runtime of a container, I have something really basic that works when I'm running the container interactive, but not when I'm just doing docker run

[01:06:24] <baldpope> if I run timeout -t 10 /opt/sleep.sh (as is the test) it works as expected

[01:07:28] *** Joins: wakeup (~wakeup@user/wakeup)
[01:11:01] <programmerq> baldpope: how does the timeout program kill the process that it launches? I don't see any TERM signal handling in your script, so /bin/sh may be ignoring the TERM signal if that is indeed what the timeout program sends.
[01:12:14] <baldpope> the signal defaults to just TERM
[01:12:24] <baldpope> I didn't try to specify, but I could quick - 1sec
[01:14:19] <baldpope> no change

[01:18:34] <programmerq> baldpope: yeah, that /bin/sh script doesn't have any handler for TERM, so I'm not surprised it's doing nothing.
[01:19:22] <baldpope> apologies, still confused... timeout should just terminate, right?
[01:19:57] <baldpope> if I run timeout -t 10 /opt/sleep.sh - timeout kills it after 10 seconds (when interactive)

[01:56:52] <ikke> oh, sorry
[01:57:02] <baldpope> no problem, you're good
[01:57:02] <programmerq> tabakhase: --init would not help the timeout binary sending a signal to its own child.
[01:58:05] <programmerq> baldpope: so as long as the thing you are running can properly handle the TERM signal, then you should be good. You can add signal handling to a shell script. You could install alpine's bash package if /bin/bash behaves the way you want, and use that.
[01:58:07] <baldpope> and stupid question - docker itself doesn't have a timeout or max run time that I'm unaware of?
[01:58:26] <tabakhase> programmerq "it fixes it" - nowhere did i say its the right way :D

[01:58:38] <programmerq> tabakhase: but it doesn't fix this usecase
[01:58:45] <tabakhase> baldpope here a "trap your signals" example: this also works correctly - on alpine: docker run --rm alpine:3.9 timeout -t 2 /bin/sh -c 'bailout() { echo bailing; exit 1; }; trap bailout SIGTERM; echo before; sleep
[01:58:45] <tabakhase>  5; echo after;'
[01:59:03] <tabakhase> docker run --rm alpine:3.9 timeout -t 2 /bin/sh -c 'bailout() { echo bailing; exit 1; }; trap bailout SIGTERM; echo before; sleep
[01:59:03] <tabakhase>  5; echo after;'
[01:59:08] <tabakhase> t long dang sr
[01:59:15] <programmerq> it would simply wrap the /usr/bin/timeout command in the tini, but that would have absolutely no effect on the signal that the timeout binary sends to the shell script.
[01:59:19] <baldpope> lols - irc not happy with your msgs
[01:59:20] <baldpope> :D
[02:00:05] <tabakhase> baldpope there ya go https://paste.debian.net/1231461/
[02:00:17] <tabakhase> (that bailing echo is just for visuals)
[02:00:48] <baldpope> just asking - how is your second example diff from the first?
[02:00:52] <baldpope> of the 2 working ones?
[02:01:41] <tabakhase> hm actually, that second one id still consider "broken" - it "works" as in "after will not print" B U T "time" it, still take 6 seconds total...
[02:02:17] <baldpope> yea a spare second I'm not concerned with, i'm trying to set a timeout of an hour for a process that should only run for 20-30 minutes
[02:02:43] <tabakhase> with "--init" its the correct "2-3 seconds" even on alpine...
[02:02:48] <programmerq> baldpope: you could also wrap your timeout with a slightly longer timeout that sends KILL
[02:03:16] <tabakhase> debian gets the 3 seconds every time =)
[02:03:39] <programmerq> well of course a non-busybox sh is going to have better behavior
[02:03:44] <baldpope> at this point I wonder if it's just an issue with alpine's busybox
[02:03:57] <programmerq> busybox is a starting point and is just bare minimum
[02:04:06] <programmerq> you can always install alpine's bash package to get proper bash available
