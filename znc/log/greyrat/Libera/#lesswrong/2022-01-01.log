[00:17:04] <feepbot> arrived at the courthouse, many of the guards refused to board it. Instead, according to interviews, they claimed the onset of sudden illness. Seven of them dialed 911, complaining of chest pain, leg injuries, lightheadedness and palpitations. One produced a cane as proof of disability. More than a dozen officers left in ambulances.

[02:16:58] <two2thehead> the vast majority of english words don't have capital letters in the middle of them
[02:17:17] <two2thehead> i suppose that could signal that it's pronunciation is different?

[02:18:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Texture is good (maybe a tad dry, but well within acceptable range), the icings are good (not too sweet, icing texture's proper), the cookie itself has... I think a bit of almond flavoring?
[02:19:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, this is definitely a solid 3.5/5, would be 4/5 if moister (and I bet it reaches that if consumed fresh; I ordered late in the day and it's New Year's Eve)

[03:32:04] <rmmh> you can import code dynamically, and if your dispatch involves scanning a list of registered hooks it's easy to replace
[03:32:48] <gwern> I'm sure objc can do it. even haskell has irc bots with hot reloading
[03:32:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sounds like that really only works for simple bots, though
[03:33:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or simple changes to them
[03:33:20] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: feepbot uses a wonderful hack
[03:33:23] <saturn2> most languages should be able to do it, although it might not be as easy
[03:33:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Oh?
[03:33:30] <feep> exec keeps existing sockets open
[03:33:44] <rmmh> I find that I rarely poke at the core bot code
[03:33:48] <feep> so feepbot has a special commandline flag that passes a socket handle to consider as its server connection
[03:33:48] <rmmh> most changes are in the plugins
[03:33:54] <feep> and it just execs its new binary over itself
[03:33:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: I do it all the time
[03:34:08] <rmmh> it also depends on how 'microkernel' your bot setup is
[03:34:24] <gwern> the haskell trick is the xmonad trick: serialize the state, exec the fresh binary, and pass the state into it
[03:34:25] <saturn2> exec preserving file handles is completely intentional and not a hack
[03:34:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: That's cool I guess but if the price of hot reloading is "using low level APIs" then... no thx :p
[03:34:39] <feep> well you have to use them once
[03:34:53] <rmmh> but most all my plugins are string->string, with some convenience functions for triggering based on a command or a regex
[03:34:54] <feep> tho your framework needs support for constructing a socket from a file handle
[03:34:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> #notevenonce
[03:34:57] <feep> and extracting a file handle
[03:35:01] <feep> which tbf may be hard
[03:35:04] <gwern> (being able to serialize all state is a good idea anyway)
[03:35:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: Robomot is way more advanced than that
[03:35:15] <feep> saturn2: the hack is the binary overwriting itself with itself
[03:35:17] <saturn2> transferring the ssl state might be hard
[03:35:25] <rmmh> is robomot on github
[03:35:31] <feep> tho yeah
[03:35:36] <rmmh> I see it do url titles and rss feeds
[03:35:38] <feep> saturn2: oh yeah...
[03:35:53] <feep> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah I think the easiest way might be to run your bot over a bouncer?
[03:35:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> rmmh: It is not on github, no, though some small parts of it are
[03:36:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Probably yes
[03:36:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep: Not sure there's much point though

[05:28:30] <gwern> that was one of the problems for the gathering, people wanted to test but couldn't find tests /shrug
[05:30:24] <phill> Do valve masks prevent spread if you're infected? 
[05:30:42] <gwern> no. they only have filters in ingress, the outflow is just a hole in the plastic
[05:30:51] <gwern> so you're breathing out pure unadulterated poison
[05:31:22] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: if you haven't seen the inline similar-links, this is an example I added last night: https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/neuroscience/index#hogendoorn-2021-section currently collapsed by default in indexes

[05:31:39] <saturn2> that's okay though, anyone who didn't want to be infected would have brought their own valved respirator
[05:32:32] <gwern> we shouldn't let them dodge personal responsibility
[05:32:36] <gwern> it takes two to make a case!
[05:32:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: What do you mean collapsed? You're talking about the "similar" link right?
[05:33:02] <gwern> at bottom
[05:33:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't see it
[05:33:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> nm I see it
[05:33:58] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: the way it works is te 'similar link' gets *dumped into* the annotation when I write it. then I look it over, delete most of it, keep the rest as a 'See Also', and now the auto-generated 'similar links' deletes those (because they are dupes) and pulls _n_ more suggestions from the database
[05:34:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow
[05:34:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Why does it start with an hr
[05:34:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Makes it mysterious until expanded
[05:34:41] <gwern> I thought it'd be classier and I wanted to distinguish from being 'part of the paper'
[05:34:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Looks cool - "<sun symbol> click to expand" - but opaque
[05:34:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not great for discoverability
[05:35:17] <gwern> I might drop the collapsing and put it in []s
[05:35:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> :\
[05:35:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Leave it in a "See also" heading, just... drop the hr
[05:36:25] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: ie '“A free energy principle for the brain” “The cartesian folk theater: People conceptualize consciousness as a spatio-temporally localized process in the human brain”' etc were all in the 'similar links' popup, until they got appended, I whitelisted them, and now 'similar' contains some additional links that were invisible before (they're sorted, so...
[05:36:29] <nshepperd> you can get aftermarket outflow filters for some valved masks
[05:36:31] <gwern> ...'“Backpropagation and the brain” / “Generative Models of Brain Dynamics—A review”' etc would not have been there before as they scored too poorly to make the original cutoff)
[05:36:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Very cool

[05:58:57] <gwern> no. it just has a little valve that flaps

[05:59:05] <gwern> most P100s don't have any exhaust filter
[05:59:16] <RiversHaveWings> i got some for mine
[05:59:20] <RiversHaveWings> but they aren't here yet
[05:59:20] <gwern> they are, after all, designed for things like fires or construction or general bad air, not infections
[05:59:23] <spxtr> why not just wear an n95 or kn95 or something like that?
[05:59:29] <RiversHaveWings> spxtr: omicron
[05:59:43] <spxtr> what does that mean?
[06:00:10] <RiversHaveWings> yeah 3M sells source control filters you can install in their P100s and i have also seen some for medical use that have them built in
[06:02:30] <saturn2> what's the shortage situation?
[06:02:32] <gwern> my focus has been entirely on not getting infected. I wasn't really counting on 'surprise! I'm now more infectious than measles, apparently!'
[06:02:34] <spxtr> is a well-fit n95 not good against omicron or something?
[06:03:19] <RiversHaveWings> spxtr: i don't trust them to actually work anymore.
[06:03:21] <gwern> they didn't look like they'd seal as well as the plastic edgings could /shrug
[06:03:35] <spxtr> RiversHaveWings: why is that?
[06:04:05] <RiversHaveWings> because measures sufficient to bring Delta Rt to ~1.1 only brought Omicron Rt to ~3.5
[06:04:37] <saturn2> it still attenuates the virus as much as it did before, but there's more virus (or more infective virus) in the air
[06:06:16] <saturn2> so the same 20x reduction might not be enough to reach your desired risk tolerance anymore

[07:53:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> i.e. places to stay away from? :p
[07:53:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, continuing to read the Leverage blog post:
[07:54:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> The section titled "A diverse group splits up into diverse groups", whose contents are unsurprising, has strong echoes of "The Tyranny of Structurelessness"
[07:54:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Every time Cathleen is like "and then X result happened" I'm like "obviously, yes"
[07:54:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Just like happens every time anything like this is attemped"
[07:55:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> So much to say here:
[07:55:10] <spxtr> Obormot\Arcturus: yeah, I'm trying to integrate a few libraries and it's pretty horrible. I have it sort of hobbling along though. Hopefully will have a demo in a day or two.
[07:55:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. "We wanted the best, but it turned out like always"
[07:55:57] <saturn2> spxtr: what are you making?
[07:56:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. "No matter what kind of organization we try to build, we always end up with the Communist Party"
[07:56:25] <spxtr> saturn2: something that helps you memorize chess openings. similar to listudy but a bit more configurable and also simpler
[07:56:39] <saturn2> oh, neat
[07:56:50] <spxtr> saturn2: it's basically chessground (lichess' chess board) + chess.js + pgn-parser
[07:57:00] <spxtr> + some basic logic for making moves and undoing them and so on
[07:57:12] <saturn2> i see
[07:57:55] <spxtr> the thing it does differently from listudy is it lets you choose how the computer makes moves, depth first, breadth first, iterated depth first, weighted by popularity on lichess, etc
[07:58:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> 3. One is reminded of the famous AI with Sussman and Minsky. What if we remove all social rules - then there won't be any rules! Well, no, of course there will be; they'll be the rules we come with, built-in
[07:58:18] <spxtr> depending on how well you know the repertoire you will want different strategies
[08:00:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Another way to look at it is sort of the extreme version of the naive view argued against in "The Real Rules Have No Exceptions": what if we remove ALL the rules, and we treat *every* case as exceptional?? Well, obviously what will happen is that you'll still be governed by rules - namely, whatever hidden rules are generating your responses to the exceptions)
[08:00:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Except you won't know what the rules are, because, like pre-enlightenment Sussman, you thought that you could make the room empty by closing your eyes)
[08:01:39] <saturn2> i can't believe you're going to slog through this entire thing
[08:01:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But of course it's actually even dumber than that, because the "default" or "baseline" rules *are* already known, without even needing to do "independent sociology research" or w/e!)
[08:02:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Well I ran out of The Witcher to watch and there's no other good shows on...

[08:03:53] <Robomot> Arcane (TV Series 2021– ) - IMDb (Arcane: With Hailee Steinfeld, Kevin Alejandro, Jason Spisak, Harry Lloyd. Set in utopian Piltover and the oppressed underground of Zaun, the story follows the origins of two iconic League champions-and the power that will tear them apart.)
[08:04:12] <ardent[m]> yes
[08:04:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok I'll give it a try, thanks
[08:04:48] <ardent[m]> if you know a lot about League lore you might know some of the story already
[08:05:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have literally no idea what you're talking about
[08:05:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> What League
[08:05:09] <ardent[m]> of Legends
[08:05:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... this is a show based on League of Legends? The game?
[08:05:28] <ardent[m]> yes
[08:05:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Suddenly my interest in watching this is gone
[08:06:39] <ardent[m]> in all irony, League of Legends may be the only LoL universe property that's noncanonical, since the entire concept of the Summoner's Rift was taken out of the lore (probably for the better)
[08:07:16] <gwern> ironically, arcane may be one of the examples of licensing being bad - probably costs you a lot of money, creative freedom, and doesn't bring you a builtin fanbase so much as confuse everyone and require a lot of explanation and justification
[08:07:40] <gwern> sort of like if you wanted to make a good resident evil movie, you're better off not calling it _resident evil_ and indeed avoiding the franchise like the plague
[08:07:41] <nshepperd2> i'll watch it and report back if its the only tv show based on a game that has ever been good
[08:08:00] <gwern> you are slandering my childhood and _Pokemon_ ;_;
[08:08:20] <gwern> at christmas we spontaneously sang the theme song 'Gotta Catch'em All' in the kitchen
[08:08:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Your service is appreciated, and I look forward to your report

[08:09:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> I celebrated by staying at home

[08:09:58] <nshepperd2> oh good, it's on iptorrents
[08:10:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also on rutracker, of course
[08:10:39] <gwern> (new years is so boozy... maybe we could make it better by convincing everyone to switch to kava instead. "it's a much nicer anxiolytic stimulant, doesn't dehydrate you as a diuretic or screw up your sleep, no hangover, and zero calories")
[08:11:03] <Obormot\Gaia> Is it better than modafinil
[08:11:11] <spxtr> arcane was significantly better than I expected, but significantly worse than the reviews indicate
[08:11:30] <spxtr> it's worth watching for an okay plot, decent characters, and a very unique animation style that works very well
[08:11:38] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: modafinil is just a pure stim. different category altogether. modafinil is competing with, like, caffeine and nicotine and low-dose amphetamines
[08:11:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I don't get it - pure as opposed to what?
[08:12:18] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: alcohol mixes up stimulant and depressant effects
[08:12:30] <ardent[m]> modafinil (adrafinil ime) makes you less sleepy without making you more rested
[08:12:35] <ardent[m]> best explanation I can say
[08:12:49] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't think any stimulant makes you "more rested" though
[08:13:07] <ardent[m]> yeah but a dopamine rush can sure cover up a lot of not being rested
[08:13:11] <gwern> (regrettably, I only get the depressant effects. I have not, nor will I ever, dance on the tables)
[08:13:27] <ardent[m]> moda doesn't even try to cover that up
[08:13:49] <gwern> yeah, it's certainly a weird feeling. I always quote bilbo about feeling like butter scraped over too much bread
[08:14:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Yes but what about this kava stuff
[08:14:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> ardent[m]: Don't take adrafinil, it's bad for your liver
[08:15:36] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: oh. well, kava has a similar mixed profile: it both stimulants and relaxes/reduces anxiety, in a sort of 'passive but sharp' mindful feeling. and it seems to do so more consistently: certainly it works as described for me. and while the flavor of kava extract is nothing to write home about, it avoids drawbacks of alcohol like its considerable caloric content, the diuretic...
[08:15:42] <gwern> ...side-effect (hangovers in general), and so on 
[08:15:50] <ardent[m]> How long does kava last?
[08:16:02] <gwern> depends on dosage, of course. a few hours ish
[08:16:19] <PapuaHardyNet> sweet. I'll buy bottles of this stuff once I move out
[08:16:22] <gwern> reasonably comparable to alcohol in that respect, so you can use it much the same way
[08:16:25] <ardent[m]> does it keep you awake, make you more likely to fall asleep, or neither?
[08:16:44] <gwern> neither, I think, so you can fall asleep if you want
[08:16:48] <ardent[m]> (where the answer for alcohol is "the latter, but it's complicated)
[08:16:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Doesn't modafinil also reduce anxiety though
[08:16:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> (In my experience it does)
[08:17:19] <gwern> hm, not in my experience, and not really reported much either. modafinil as an anxiolytic? no, not really
[08:18:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Always has for me
[08:18:10] * gwern is ordering a bigger batch of kava soon because the first went well
[08:19:20] <gwern> thus far, the only drawbacks of kava are that it doesn't taste good or integrate into drinks as well as alcohol does, there's an initial loading phase, and it is fairly unusual making it hard/expensive to get good-quality
[08:19:31] <ardent[m]> what about the ND tablets?
[08:19:59] <gwern> I haven't tried that. I've been using drinkroot because that seems to be about as close as you can get to grinding up and using the roots yourself
[08:20:30] <phill> Online people say you can't OD on kava but I absolutely did
[08:20:51] <gwern> (and the weirdo chemistry of kava water suggests that any pill or tablet may be weak)
[08:21:23] <gwern> phill: well, you obviously didn't die (or did you???) so what happened?
[08:21:34] <phill> Nah, I just threw up a bunch
[08:21:43] <ardent[m]> yeah "can't OD" doesn't mean you can't have a bad time
[08:21:58] <gwern> otherwise known as "any day of the week ending in -day" in ayahuasca-land :)
[08:22:07] <ardent[m]> you can't OD on LSD but I wouldn't recommend 10mg
[08:22:31] <ardent[m]> (haven't taken any myself yet, I just know that this is 100 doses lol)
[08:22:53] <gwern> (I wouldn't either, but isn't 10mg at the point where you just black out and do & remember nothing and the LSD is just wasted?)
[08:24:12] <phill> It *was* weird experiencing the lack of balance usually associated with alcohol without the drunkenness aspect
[08:24:57] <ardent[m]> post-vaccine fever felt like almost the opposite of that
[08:25:11] <gwern> I can imagine. although you can get a similar effect if you combine another GABA agent. mix some phenibut with your alcohol for a curious time

[08:31:55] <phill> (My psychiatrist also warned against fast acting anxiolytics combined with lack of social perception skills)
[08:33:21] <saturn2> good lord, liftmode.com has become one of the most ridiculous webshit 2.0 abominations i've ever seen
[08:34:16] <gwern> phill: surely that's a fast path to acting like you have social perception skills!
[08:34:24] <ardent[m]> phill: that's why it's best to get in an environment where people will commonly be reducing their anxiety
[08:34:44] <adiabatic> so, like, he needs to be around yoga chicks all the time?
[08:35:04] <rmmh> ANXIOLYTICS ARE CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
[08:35:06] <ardent[m]> the social convention of alcohol (e.g. being excused for bad dance moves) isn't about being drunk, it's about being in a place where people get drunk
[08:35:47] <gwern> (which could be applied to kava or whatever if we wanted)
[08:35:54] <ardent[m]> yeah
[08:36:14] * gwern wonders how much inroads alcohol has made into kava islands
[08:36:32] <ardent[m]> acting like you're on MDMA at EDC is probably acceptable regardless of your mental state at the time

[12:49:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> This might be the dumbest take on the concept of the "red pill" that I've seen
[12:49:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> "the red pill is estrogen" my god. I feel stupider just reading it
[12:54:40] <PapuaHardyNet> but... that's what the Wachowski brothers are saying. I know "death of the author" and all that, but what if this is really what they intended?

[12:59:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> I doubt it's what they intended though
[12:59:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> It doesn't make any sense whatsoever in context
[13:00:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now, what probably *is* true is that they were *inspired*, artistically, by their own experiences with gender dysphoria
[13:00:07] <PapuaHardyNet> I agree, it makes no sense at all, especially that would mean "everyone" should be red-pilled, and wanting everyone to become trans women is basically terrorism
[13:00:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> But that is not at all the same thing as saying "this is what it means in the actual work"

[18:28:59] <two2thehead> kuudes, s0ph1a feep : hm. Not sure how accurate this is but food for thought. " I really don't think there's a country as stubborn as Japan. They literally refuse to innovate and respect other countries technologies. It happened with Nikon and Canon vs ASML and is happening with their automakers as well. At least German manufacturers have close ties with China and respect their technology and realize they NEED to innovate to remain relevant. We need 
[18:28:59] <two2thehead> to admit China is really great at software and manufacturing quality products, for a better price. Not to mention their excellent customer service which is going to be a big plus for Nio compared to that of Tesla's. We shouldn't write Honda off though. Bankruptcy for companies this big is still unlikely. They have many tools to keep their heads above water, but might need to sell off a part of their business and they will have to completely change 
[18:29:01] <two2thehead> their business model and the way they see the future. Look at Nokia, another dinosaur which had many years with great losses, but now is starting to make a comeback with 5G technology and being profitable again."
[18:29:51] <two2thehead> the software part makes me skeptical. But maybe he's referring to in-car/in-vehicle software specifically?
[18:36:43] <gwern> I would describe japan more as the 'most stubborn rich non-oil state'
[18:37:17] <kuudes> nshepperd2, we never know; and the log might call some system log that runs on java
[18:38:08] <gwern> there are richer stubborner countries, but they're just petrostates; there are less stubborn equally rich or richer non-petrostates like the USA but they are forced to be less stubborn because they are generally more inept than Japan; and there are plenty of much more stubborn states but they're all much much poorer and often hellholes like failed african states or north korea
[18:40:07] <synthmeat> gamepads are one of the most ergonomic computer input devices, aren't they?
[18:40:31] <gwern> japan is in the enviable position of being so good at so many things that they can fail on an epic scale that other countries can only dream of. sort of like the USA invading countries, except with car engines instead. (loads of people may die either way, just differently)

[19:12:24] <two2thehead> "Cognitive control serves a crucial role in human higher mental functions. The Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) account provides a unifying theoretical framework that decomposes cognitive control into two qualitatively distinct mechanisms – proactive control and reactive control. While prior behavioral and neuroimaging work has demonstrated the validity of individual tasks in isolating these two mechanisms of control, there has not been 
[19:12:24] <two2thehead> a comprehensive, theoretically-guided task battery specifically designed to tap into proactive and reactive control across different domains of cognition. To address this critical limitation and provide useful methodological tools for future investigations, the Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control (DMCC) task battery was developed to probe these two control modes, as well as their intra-individual and inter-individual differences, across four 
[19:12:24] <two2thehead> prototypical domains of cognition: selective attention, context processing, multi-tasking, and working memory. We present this task battery, along with detailed descriptions of the experimental manipulations used to encourage shifts to proactive or reactive control in each of the four task domains. We rigorously evaluate the group effects of these manipulations in primary indices of proactive and reactive control, establishing the validity of the 
[19:12:32] <two2thehead> DMCC task battery in providing dissociable yet convergent measures of the two cognitive control modes."

[19:21:41] <two2thehead> "There is widespread agreement that the capacity for cognitive control is a central element of human adaptability, achievement, and flourishing. While this  ability to flexibly regulate, update, and  coordinate thoughts  and  actions in  accordance  with internally  maintained goals is one  of humans’ most  cherished higher mental  functions,  it is also quite vulnerable to impairment, and even in healthy individuals can vary substantially(Braver
[19:21:41] <two2thehead> , 2012).Importantly, cognitive control is not a unitary process, as it encompasses a diverse range of mental functions spanning different domains of cognition (i.e.,attention, working memory, and decision-making; Kane& Engle, 2002; Miller  &  Cohen;  2001;  Miyake  et  al.,  2000). Consequently,  a major challenge has  been to characterize and explain cognitive control through a unifying and coherent theoretical framework, which ideally should 
[19:21:42] <two2thehead> provide meaningful and operationalizable core constructs that can account for both contextual (i.e., state) and individual (i.e., trait) variation in these functions."

[20:58:40] <kuudes> for instance, when neo fights smith, he uses yoga, not karate or judo or krav maga

[21:00:23] <kuudes> or I just don't know something
[21:01:09] <kuudes> but there were a lot of chehov's gun things divided between II and III so that the showing of gun was in II and use of gun was in III
[21:01:40] <kuudes> also, one word titles for movies could be NEO, ONE, EON
[21:03:00] <kuudes> the first movie being more about the main person, prologue, the second movie about the main story, confirmation of hero, the third movie a sort of prologue, drawing wide philosophical lines; or something
[21:03:53] <vrs> 1 and 2 had a pretty tight philosophical focus each - simulation and freedom of choice respectively
[21:03:54] <kuudes> basicly imo the trilogy makes more sense if you put cum laude level post hoc explaining into the interpretation; this may be seen as a bad or good feature, depending on person
