[22:22:22] <sixecho> had this happen a couple times now... i'm running `shasum` which is in /usr/local/bin from the perl keg.  fails with `Can't continue after import errors at /usr/local/bin/shasum line 24.` `BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/local/bin/shasum line 24.`   i think reinstalling perl might have fixed it last time - but wanted to ask first before trying... in case someone wants to debug.
[22:25:00] <sixecho> ^ in the meantime changing my scripts to point at /usr/bin/shasum and modding my path.  dunno why perl is bringing shasum with it - should probably be excluded from brews
