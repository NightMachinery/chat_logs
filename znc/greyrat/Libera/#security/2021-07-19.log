[22:48:25] <bewees> hi, how vulnerable are point to shoot cameras with wifi and bluetooth modules, provided you use neither of them? In times of pegasus your phone is remotely accessible by mobile networks or a wifi hotspot - does a popular brand camera face these issues too? I'm not sure pegasus would actually work either if you never actively connect to a mobile or wifi network. In case of a compact camera you would need to have a severe vulnerability to trigger it
[22:48:25] <bewees> connecting to an untrusted wifi connection you didn't manually configure right?

[23:06:14] <ajak> if a device is exploitable by connecting to an untrusted AP then you're safe as long as you don't connect to an untrusted AP, rigth?

[23:09:34] <MadCamel> sure. I bet there's plenty of vulns in wifi/bluetooth firmware that don't require any connection though. They need to stop giving these chips full bus/DMA access and write the drivers as if the device is hostile.
[23:11:03] <bewees> MadCamel: not sure that will ever happen in the next decades, microkernels such as sel4 will probably only be used in niche areas
[23:11:26] <ajak> i'm not convinced that's a reasonable threat model to have
[23:11:58] <bewees> so there have been vulnerabilities in the past that triggered the wifi firmware to connect to an untrusted hotspot?
[23:12:00] <MadCamel> it's a lot of effort. Something more practical might be to offload connectivity to its own system on a chip, or at least a secure compartment on the main system. Like they do with cellular basebands.
[23:12:35] <bewees> yes compartmentalization is an option today
[23:12:35] <MadCamel> At least then there's some isolation.
[23:12:42] <ajak> bewees: there can be vulnerabilities in everything, should you care? not necessarily
[23:13:22] <bewees> ajak: why should I not care? News I read this week is frightening

[23:14:01] <mats1> guess there'll be a lot of paranoid walk-ins this week as pegasus news gets trickled out
[23:14:02] <ajak> i mean should you care about the threat of vulnerabilities in your wifi chip that don't involve connecting to a bad AP? not necessarily
[23:14:12] *** Joins: saroy (~Sandipan@45.249.73.198)
[23:14:50] <bewees> if they leave such a vulnerability behind it will sooner or later be used by anyone, not just the ones they intended to
[23:15:00] <MadCamel> well I care because if I could replicate the vulnerability I'd have fun walking through manhattan with a backpack that changes everyone's background to goatse and locks them out of the settings
[23:15:03] <mats1> and not even the fun kind of walk-ins, but 'how vulnerable is my point to shoot', ugh
[23:15:44] <mats1> who tha fuck cares about your camera when millions of people are playing pokemon go?
[23:16:13] <ajak> MadCamel: you need to actually find a bug in it first
[23:17:13] <MadCamel> sure ajak
[23:17:31] <MadCamel> I'm just saying what I'd do if I did find one

[23:20:33] <MadCamel> problem with bug hunting lately is that the low hanging fruit is gone. It now requires a large time/energy investment or some serious luck. Rules out people like me who have a day job. It's mostly students and career professionals now.
[23:20:35] <TimMc> MadCamel: Remember, don't commit more than one crime at the same time.
[23:20:41] <[iz]> takes a screenshot, sets thier background to that screenshot, and then kills a random window
[23:21:03] <mats1> plenty of 90s era bugs in embedded devices
[23:21:11] <MadCamel> yeah true that
[23:21:17] <mats1> dont make excuses
[23:21:58] <[iz]> that's another funny exploit payload
[23:22:47] <[iz]> more respectable chuckle vs shock humor
[23:23:29] <MadCamel> I'm not. I find bugs and exploit embedded devices somewhat regularly. Most recently I found a buffer overflow in the ARM flight controller in my drone. Using the camera module that runs linux to send it a payload via serial that diddles some bits and removes the altitude/distance restrictions
[23:24:27] <bewees> DryOS kernel is only 16 KB big, less lines less vulnerabilities
[23:24:31] <[iz]> lots of those embedded linux devices are funny easy
[23:25:34] <[iz]> like just attach a console and the debug output printed to is gold sometimes
[23:26:42] <MadCamel> yeah if it's running linux it's usually stupid easy
[23:27:00] <MadCamel> this one was fun because the flight board runs freertos
[23:27:09] <bewees> CVE-2019-5994 to CVE-2019-6001 on DRYOS PTP implementation

[23:28:17] <MadCamel> but as far as people like me finding a vuln in a popular wifi or bluetooth chip? Yeah maybe if I was independently wealthy and had a bucket of adderall haha
[23:29:00] <[iz]> i ran into a few devices that did that, i assume that when QA got to it, they were using devices w/out consoles, so no one noticed debugging output was still getting printed to console
[23:31:07] <MadCamel> actual console ports, or just header pins?
[23:31:21] <[iz]> just header pins of course
