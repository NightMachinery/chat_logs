[00:01:07] <xenu> (print((-99505)) % 255);
[00:01:56] <xenu> you can avoid that by either adding more parens or by prefixing the first paren with +

[11:38:12] <pj> oh, okay
[11:38:57] <pj> thanks for the explanation, that makes sense.  it also means that times() is useless for what I wanted it for.

[11:43:03] <pj> xenu: Trying to check the response time of a remote service, so waiting for the service to respond won't use up CPU time and therefore will not register in times().  I'll simply use a different method.
[11:43:29] <xenu> if time() isn't precise enough, take a look at Time::HiRes module

[16:52:54] <Altreus> '.' was removed from default @INC a while ago
[16:52:56] <alh_> No, that was removed in 5.26
[16:53:00] <Altreus> I prefer -I lib

[16:53:12] <Altreus> prove -Ilib t/
[16:53:13] <haj> The same directory isn't in @INC... best to put your module into a subdirectory 'lib' and test with prove -vl
[16:53:20] <phryk> so I do "perl -I . test.pl"?
[16:53:28] <Altreus> oh yes, and have a lib dir :D
[16:53:36] <phryk> oh, not talking about unit tests … yet.
[16:53:49] <phryk> just running a little test script to see whether anything obviously explodes.^^
[16:53:53] <Altreus> having a lib dir is a convention for a reason and the reason is you want other files in the root of the project
[16:54:01] <haj> If you insist to have it in the same dir, yes.  But "." is the current directory of your shell, not relative to your source
[16:54:33] <phryk> haj: which is a potayto-potahto situation as I'm running it from that directory.
[16:55:36] <phryk> Altreus: is lib also the way to go if I want to put the module into a namespace like Sub::?
[16:55:45] <phryk> or would I then use "Sub" as the directory name?
[16:55:50] <Altreus> phryk: Certainly - lib/Sub/Module.pm
[16:56:00] <phryk> Ah. Thanks.

[16:56:51] <Altreus> dunno, I just run `dzil new` these days :D
[16:57:12] <Altreus> honestly the conventions that matter are "have a lib/ and a t/"
[16:57:13] <phryk> Finding dzil on cpanmetadb failed
[16:57:29] <haj> Dist::Zilla is the distribution, dzil is the command
[16:57:30] <phryk> Okay, that I can do :D
[16:57:32] <Altreus> maybe that doesn't index commands
[16:57:35] <phryk> ah, thanks
[16:57:39] <haj> But it comes with a learnung curve
[16:57:42] <Altreus> it does
[16:58:02] <Altreus> But once you've surmounted it, you don't have to think ever again!
[16:58:05] <phryk> Okay, then I'll just do lib + t right now.
[16:58:27] <haj> I agree with Altreus - this pays off very soon

[17:13:13] <aquanight> my only issue with things like lib::relative (or anything related to 'use lib') is it seems like there's not a convenient way to confine its effects to the module which needs it
[17:13:19] <Grinnz> phryk: https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Starter the first sections aren't dzil-specific but feel free to ask anything you need clarified

[17:14:05] <phryk> I'm still on the attribute-based decorators and am trying to pour that into a re-usable module. The new issue is that the MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES function of the module isn't called and thus the new attributes don't work – if I'm not mistaken this is because test.pl is in namespace 'main' and the module has its own namespace – that sound about right?
[17:14:10] <aquanight> you could maybe do something like: BEGIN { local @INC = @INC; require lib::relative; lib::relative->import(whatever); require the::actual::thing::you::need; the::actual::thing::you::need->import; }
[17:14:39] <Grinnz> aquanight: yeah there is no simple way to do require_from_specific_dir
[17:14:47] <Grinnz> except to do that with an absolute path yourself
[17:15:00] <Grinnz> which screws up caching
[17:15:23] <Grinnz> if you do it with local, anything that module loads may get loaded from that same dir
[17:15:33] <phryk> "perl -I lib" works fine for development purposes right now. :)

[17:17:45] <aquanight> of course, the other problem is it still leaves @INC only temporarily modified one time during the package load-time
[17:17:50] <aquanight> there's no way to get a true lexical @INC

[17:27:19] <phryk> Anyone know anything about my MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES issue, tho?^^

[17:29:49] <phryk> run with "perl -I lib test.pl"
[17:30:19] <phryk> attributes are viewed as invalid, as MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES from Attrocators.pm isn't being called.
[17:30:59] <alh> sub yeet : decorator
[17:31:11] <alh> When that is compiled, a sub in the current package called MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES is looked for
[17:31:29] <alh> You don't have that - the sub is in your Attrocators package instead
[17:31:42] <phryk> Exactly. That's what I suspected.
[17:32:02] <phryk> But how do I get it to be called without implementing a new MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES in every file I want to use my module?
[17:32:30] <alh> export the method into the calling namespace using Exporter or the like 
[17:33:17] <phryk> with "calling" it you mean the use statement?
[17:33:43] <phryk> is there a callback or something to react to a module being use'd?
[17:33:59] <aquanight> this is the thing I've always wondered about attributes. You have to export a MODIFY_whatever_ATTRIBUTES method, how are you supposed to work alongside other attribute packages?
[17:34:22] <aquanight> if it's really run as a method, you could conceivably push yourself into the calling package's @ISA
[17:34:28] <alh> Maybe take a ref to the existing sub in the parent before exporting, and wrap it? Not great

[22:33:13] <phryk> so, I added "use Exporter 'import';" and "our @EXPORT_OK = qw(MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES);" to my module, but MODIFY_CODE_ATTRIBUTES is never called… How do I even go about debugging this?
[22:33:58] <thrig> show more code?
[22:34:09] <phryk> Also, what's the difference between @EXPORT_OK and @EXPORT – the documentation mentions you should use the former, but doesn't mention the actual difference
[22:34:14] <gordonfish> phryk: You need to call the sub from the module/program use'ing your module. Export just adds it into the use'ees space.
[22:34:23] <alh> @EXPORT exports everything by default
[22:34:25] <gordonfish> You still need to call the routine
[22:34:27] <alh> @EXPORT_OK items must be explicitly requested
[22:34:35] <alh> use Foo; # Grabs *everything* in @EXPORT 
[22:34:58] <gordonfish> use Module_that_Exports_Foo; ... Foo(...);
[22:35:17] <phryk> And for example the 'import' in "use Exporter 'import'" is a thing from @EXPORT_OK?
[22:35:35] <gordonfish> use Module_that_Exports qw(Foo); ... Foo(...); # When Foo is exported with just @EXPORT_OK;

[22:36:56] <phryk> ah yes, using @EXPORT instead of @EXPORT_OK fixes everything :3

[22:38:19] <phryk> alh: Exactly, that's what I just did and it works fine. :)
[22:38:26] <alh> Great
[22:39:00] <haj>   "use Exporter 'import'" means: This code is using Exporter's predefined method, which is to export stuff in EXPORT and EXPORT_OK (and tags etc).  You can write your own 'import' method if you need another callback when someone "use"s the module
[22:39:12] <phryk> Kind of confused why I don't need to export the hash holding all the decortor coderefs, tho… I assume the function is still kinda-sorta being called in the scope of the module it's originally defined in?
