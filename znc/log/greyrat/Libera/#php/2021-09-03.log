[00:16:39] <mastoll> made it!
[00:17:56] <Rockwood> cheers
[00:20:35] <mastoll> I think this is simple, but for some reason I'm resistant: In a function that is fed $x and $y, a $temp = array is declared. Then, $temp [] = $x; and $temp []; yields a 2-index array. Am I to  understand from this that $arrayname [] = $scalarvariable is a way of loading indexed values into an array?
[00:21:22] <mastoll> Yikes, I mis-typed. One more time: Then, $temp [] = $x; and $temp [] = $y; yields a 2-index array.
[00:21:47] <Sammitch> yes, $foo[] = $bar appends to the array

[00:29:34] <Byteflux> mastoll: `$arr[] = $val` is an expression that appends *any* value to an array, not just scalars. arrays are not scalars and as you noted, you can create multi-dimensional arrays this way.
[00:30:21] <Byteflux> ah, actually you weren't talking about multi-dimensional
[00:30:39] <Byteflux> you literally meant 2 elements... but still. the same truth holds, you can append non-scalars to an array.
[00:31:21] <Byteflux> (mentioning because you used $scalarvariable as an example)
[00:31:36] <mastoll> Byteflux, in the problem I'm deciphering, it is working with a multidimensional array, so the point is relevant. Thanks.

[00:33:39] <Byteflux> mastoll: no problem. also i would recommend using the `$arr[]` format over `$arr []` as you will almost never see the latter in the wild, so the former will be more readable to anyone looking at your code.
[00:35:58] <mastoll> Byteflux, ah yes; skipping convention does not make the description clearer after all.

[01:38:45] <Albright> hey yes php
[01:41:05] <Albright> Question: Is there a security issue with having a "redirect to this URL after completion" value be a (theoretically alterable) field on a form? I seem to remember reading something about that at one time but can't currently remember what the security issue might have been.
[01:42:17] <Albright> I mean even if so, if instead of a URL it's just a path, and server-side I put our domain name in front of it before sending the Location header… the worst they could do is cause a 404 on our own server, right?
[01:43:20] <__adrian> that would depend entirely on what exists on your server
[01:43:28] <__adrian> more to the point, why would you _need_ to do this?
[01:43:50] <__adrian> why doesn't your form know where it needs to redirect to?

[01:51:10] <Albright> __adrian: Most of the time it can figure it out but I've run into an issue where a form might be on one of several different pages and I want to redirect back to the same one after submission.
[01:51:45] <__adrian> whitelist it
[01:52:03] <__adrian> ideally, sounds like you'd want to simply submit via ajx
[01:52:09] <Albright> I guess I could just have a parameter which *isn't* a URL but still gets passed to the method that generates the redirect URL

[02:46:51] <renic> yeah but who wants to work on netsuite... is it still as yucky as it was 10 years ago?
[02:47:26] <impliednude> renic> I am sure I can find someone for 200.00 to fix 3-10 lines of code to authentic properly via curl.
[02:47:37] <renic> I mean... I would do it.
[02:47:38] <renic> lol
[02:47:49] <renic> but I hated netsuite when I had to bother with it.
[02:48:06] <impliednude> I hate having to bother with it. but I have to with this project.
[02:48:07] <renic> Why are you asking others to do it if you know how to do it in 3-10 lines of code?
[02:48:14] <renic> just make a commit.
[02:49:00] <renic> or maybe this is one of those scenarios where you imagine the fix is simple... but in reality... fixing it will break ten other things.
[02:49:03] <impliednude> renic> problem is, TBA authentication from the looks of it to duplicate postmans version "shouldn't" be that difficult. but it seems to be for me.
[02:49:32] <impliednude> renic> Tons of code examples. but none of them are for post'ing. all "get"
[02:49:59] <impliednude> which does it differently. So I looked at old examples. and I am getting 410 errors with netsuite
[02:50:22] <impliednude> I am sure its the as it is for when people joine #magento or #magento2 and just forgot something.
[02:50:47] <impliednude> as an oper on both. I get the frustration from people forgetting stuff.
[02:50:53] <impliednude> or just not aware
[02:50:58] <renic> and no one will help for $200 ?
[02:51:29] <impliednude> renic> people on the job site are saying they can do it but have zero experience with netsuites TBA authentication via php
[02:51:37] <impliednude> if we were doing .net I could easily build it out
[02:51:53] <impliednude> or if we allowed python at my work (which they dont)
[02:52:36] <renic> so what are you trying to do exactly?  send a post request via php?
[02:53:16] <renic> you can always manually construct an http request.... I've done that a bunch in the past.
[02:53:26] <renic> or you can use something like guzzle... and just set the method to post.
[02:54:02] <impliednude> renic> problem with netsuite is that they have it very perticular and my work doesn't want to have additional lib's on top of everything else. basically they want it inline code with php curl.
[02:54:37] <impliednude> when you construct with netsuite, you have to set the authentication system to be a part of the post
[02:54:49] <renic> but something has gone with your request... can you get the request to work with curl outside of php?
[02:55:04] <impliednude> think of it like a modified soap system
[02:55:51] <impliednude> If I use the SDK I can post via soap. or if I am using postman I can post with that. but once you port of the code they give you. its based on nonce and the key and every second and request requires a new key
[02:56:15] <impliednude> or hash
[02:56:27] <impliednude> which results in a 401 or a 410
[02:56:51] <renic> so you need to re-fetch the secret every time you get a 401 or a 410?
[02:57:14] <impliednude> yes. but I can't figure out how postman comes up with the freaking hash
[02:57:25] <impliednude> I tried multiple methods and none work
[02:57:35] <impliednude> its based on a sha256 hash
[02:58:06] <impliednude> its basically 4 keys. along with the time. then turned into a hash
[02:59:01] <renic> sure.... but you shouldn't have to construct it manually... surely... it would be some standard auth scheme.
[02:59:30] *** Parts: sshine (~simon@hubris.eta.solutions) ()
[02:59:56] <impliednude> originally netsuite used a SSO that you could use a web only key set along with id. but they got rid of that. to boot it also doesn't use a normalized oauth2 system.
[03:00:20] <impliednude> Basically they are deciding to play by their own rules.
[03:00:33] <renic> something to keep in mind... you can always build your own context for something like file_get_contents().. you don't even really need to use curl.
[03:00:46] <renic> yeah.. proprietary software usually plays by its own rules...
[03:01:17] <renic> but the part that must be done... is to figure out how the secret is being retrieved or calculated.
[03:02:13] <renic> but manually building up http requests is not really a good use of time... it comes in handy to know how.... when weird stuff needs to be dealth with though.
[03:02:34] <impliednude> I hear you and I can easily deal with guzzle. again though, constraints of my work
[03:02:40] <renic> (I don't have enough info to know if this is one of those cases)
[03:02:53] <Albright> If you are using file_get_contents() for anything other than local filesystems you need to reevaluate your life
[03:03:12] <impliednude> I hear ya albright
[03:03:30] <renic> streams..... file_get_contents doesn't actually care what you feed it as long as it can be read as a stream of bytes.

[03:03:43] <renic> nothing wrong with using features that exist....
[03:03:59] <Albright> Yes, I know. Still, use a tool explicitly for making HTTP requests when you need to make an HTTP request.
[03:04:13] <renic> sane people would use guzzle... :)

[03:10:09] <renic> can't do it without seeing code.. I'm not magical... wish I were. :)
[03:11:16] <renic> but... basic tip... on the odd chance you didn't already... compare the request headers

[11:55:06] <guy_frm_yogaland> hello everyone
[11:55:39] <guy_frm_yogaland> I want to create a php cli script which would be same a composer.init file
[11:56:58] <guy_frm_yogaland> should I use readline() or just do fopen( 'php://stdin' , 'r')  way?
[11:58:03] <Byteflux> What is a "composer.init" file and what does "would be the same" mean here?
[11:58:09] <Byteflux> I only know of a composer.json file.
[11:58:16] <Byteflux> But still, "would be the same" isn't making much sense to me.
[11:59:57] <guy_frm_yogaland> i mean how it works when i type command "composer init"
[11:59:59] <guy_frm_yogaland> that kind of cli script
[12:00:22] <guy_frm_yogaland> which stores the user's data into the composer.json file
[12:01:00] <Byteflux> If you want to invoke Composer commands from a PHP script, you can tap into Composer's API.
[12:02:44] <Byteflux> I guess for mimicking the `init` behavior, maybe you can't do that since you don't have an existing project with a Composer autoloader...
[12:02:52] <guy_frm_yogaland> no, i don't want to invoke anything, I just want to create the same thing (composer init cli script) all by myself
[12:03:08] <Naktibalda> guy_frm_yogaland: do you mean that you want to implement a wizard style interaction in cli?
[12:03:18] <guy_frm_yogaland> yeah
[12:05:10] <Naktibalda> you could try to use Symfony Console or one of libraries listed at https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php#command-line
[12:08:17] <guy_frm_yogaland> ok
[12:08:41] <Naktibalda> Cilex and Hoa Console are dead, there is no more similar libs in that list
[12:08:42] <Byteflux> Composer also has a plugin API where you can implement your own custom commands, so you could just use their API to build the exact kind of thing for whatever. This would of course require that you have a Composer project.
[12:09:05] <guy_frm_yogaland> ok
[12:11:13] <Byteflux> Your Composer plugin would need to be registered with the CommandProviderCapability and then you can create your own commands inheriting from BaseCommand
[12:11:20] <Byteflux> https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/plugins.md#command-provider
[12:11:36] <Byteflux> https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/src/Composer/Command/InitCommand.php <- the `init` command also inherits from BaseCommand so you could use it as a reference to creating a similar command for your needs.

[14:17:53] <arash> Hello, in this code "public static function split($subject, Splitter $instance)" what is the name and usage of "Splitter" ? I'm looking for a tutorial to understand it.
[14:18:20] <AllenJB> Splitter is a class name. $instance must be an instance of Splitter
[14:20:32] <Anticom> arash: put more generally it's the type information for the parameter
[14:21:15] <Anticom> arash: for example `function add(int $a, int $b) { return $a + $b; }` will produce an error if you try to pass anything but integers to it.
[14:21:49] <Byteflux> That is not true.
[14:22:19] <arash> Anticom, AllenJB thank you. :) what about "public function createMessage(): AnotherMessage" what is AnotherMessage?
[14:22:24] <Anticom> Byteflux: Maybe it's not precise but it's good enough to convey the point to introducing someone new to PHP's type concept, no need to overcomplicate things IMHO
[14:22:37] <Anticom> arash: It's the type information of the return type
[14:23:04] <Byteflux> Without an explicit `declare(strict_types=1)` in the PHP file that is calling the add() function, PHP will coerce scalar types to an int rather than generating a type error.
[14:23:13] <Anticom> Since PHP is an interpreted scripting language it can have a dynamic type system and doesn't need to be strong and statically typed. However people realized it's often a good idea to add type information to make your code more robust
[14:24:05] <Anticom> Byteflux: but if they can't be implicitly casted it will still fail. My point is you can't call `add("foo", 3)` anymore
[14:24:13] <Byteflux> It is best to be accurate. Do not rely on type hinting at save you at runtime. This is not a good idea.
[14:24:28] <Byteflux> Anticom: "foo" is a scalar, so no, it won't fail.
[14:24:33] <Anticom> Wut
[14:25:05] <Naktibalda> arash: documented at https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php
[14:25:22] <arash> Anticom, so it is ok to delete those "type information" ?! I mean the program still works, right?

[14:25:40] <arash> Naktibalda, thank you
[14:26:06] <Anticom> Byteflux: https://onlinegdb.com/cqefGuUuj
[14:26:16] <Byteflux> Well, "foo" will fail but a numeric string will not.
[14:26:47] <Naktibalda> arash: mostly yes, unless that type is declared in parent class or in implemented interface.
[14:26:48] <Anticom> Byteflux: that's exactly what I said lol :D
[14:27:12] *** Joins: christianPHP (~christian@190.232.168.110)
[14:27:31] <Byteflux> This obviously still illustrates a serious distinction that can lead to problems if unaware.
[14:27:48] <Anticom> Byteflux: I just didn't want to overwelm someone being new to a concept with details. However I get your point of being accurate and complete with the information you're giving. It's just my personal experience that digging too deep when explaining will sometimes lead to the person missing the important point due to the flood of information given :)
[14:28:42] <Anticom> arash: Yes, you can leave out the type information and in that case PHP will accept values of any type. Basically it's just an additional way of type-guarding your code but it's entirely optional
[14:29:42] <arash> Anticom, i see. thank you
[14:30:02] <arash> Naktibalda, thank you
[14:30:03] *** Joins: AsenMx (~AsenMx@78.90.248.234)
[14:30:17] <Byteflux> You should use a good editor or IDE such as PHPStorm or VSCode (or anything with similarly good tools) so that you can benefit the most from type hints. Do not count on type hinting to be useful when actually *running* your code.
[14:35:00] <arash> Byteflux, ok, but i just wanted to understand what are those. I had no information about "Type declarations". now i have
[14:37:45] <Byteflux> Sure. FWIW, having them is very handy so would definitely suggest learning/using them vs "deleting them" as you say.
[14:43:31] <arash> Byteflux, i asked that question to make sure i understand them. so i know they are only "information" and don't do anything else.
[14:45:24] <Byteflux> They are technically enforced depending on various circumstances, because the idea is that if you violate that type expectation then there's a strong possibility something will break. So it's more than just "information."
[14:47:31] <arash> Byteflux, ok. copy. thank you
[14:49:27] <Byteflux> If you look at a strongly typed language, say... Java for example. You wouldn't even be able to *compile* your program if such a type violation was present. Since PHP isn't a language that you *have* to compile first, it enforces those type declarations as the program is running, when it encounters an incompatible type.

[15:33:28] <p3rL> should i paste the script ?
[15:33:47] <Naktibalda> it is async, so keep the state somewhere
[15:34:12] <biberu> paste an sscce (http://sscce.org) of your problem, sure
[15:39:18] <p3rL> bibble Naktibalda here is the code https://termbin.com/qhpzg
[15:39:36] <p3rL> i can't get figure out how do i get the info if nick is identified or not
[15:39:47] <p3rL> line number 102 > if($nick_is_identified)
[15:40:03] <biberu> that indentation makes it very hard to read, does it look like that in your editor?
[15:40:37] <p3rL> bibble is it > https://prnt.sc/1r46jzg ?
[15:41:09] <biberu> looks like you're mixing tabs and spaces in the same file
[15:41:31] <p3rL> well that can be fix later.. script works fine
[15:41:40] <biberu> so it looks like gibberish in my browser on termbin
[15:41:44] <p3rL> the main issue is how do i recongnize if nick is identifed or not
[15:44:44] <biberu> what does the rest of the message from nickserv say?
[15:45:40] <p3rL> those part is use for recoverying nick if someone else use
[15:46:21] <p3rL> if($nick_is_identified) < the user who is trying to login the bot ... his nick must be identified with nickserv
[15:46:29] <p3rL> i can't get how this gonna be
[15:46:56] <p3rL> because if i do $this->send("WHOIS $nick") its give output in next loop
[15:47:33] <biberu> well, you'll have to send nickserv a message that requests that you log in, set your application in some state to wait for that response, then handle that when it arrives
[15:47:46] <p3rL> mann
[15:47:46] <biberu> note that you may get other messages in between, and maybe no response at all from nickserv
[15:47:49] <p3rL> that is not issue
[15:47:53] <p3rL> the nickserv part is already done
[15:48:09] <p3rL> i am not saying about botnick identification
[15:48:21] <p3rL> i am talking about users who will call the command those nicks must be identify
[15:49:27] <biberu> sorry, i'm doing other things at the same time and i guess i misunderstood something
[15:49:39] <Naktibalda> keep track of what commands you must execute after identification
[15:50:46] <p3rL> the proccess is like ChanServ is php bot ... and i want to login the bot to identify it.. for that i make a command !login 123 << !login trigger will check if my nick is identify only when i will able to login to bot otherwise i cant
[15:51:11] <p3rL> so i can't get it .. how do i know the person is typing cmd his nick is identifed or not

[20:00:58] <coder7of9> i moved a wordpress site to a new server and removed all the wordpress. rebuilt from scratch.   there is a file  wordfence-waf.php in the public_html and if i delete it i get errors file not found.   i see it in phpinfo. as a auto_prepend_file value.   i checked the  php.inin files for this value bot there   i checked the htacccess file notthere
[20:00:58] <coder7of9> ... all the files are custom built and have no trace of wordpress so the directive will not be in any files in public_html     or the framework.   where else could this value be.
[20:02:14] <BadAdviceCat> coder7of9, it might be your web server configuration that still references wordfence-waf.php

[20:42:51] <robertparkerx> $xp->evaluate('string(./a/@class)', $node) seems wrong
[20:43:43] <renic> tbh... if you just load it into domdocument without fiddling with he markup... you're probably going to have a better time.
[20:44:49] <renic> but you're going to want to treat it as xml ... i.e. it needs a root node.
[20:45:36] <renic> what's the reason behind mutilating the string before passing it to domdocument?
[20:48:13] <renic> ... hmmm... and... speaking of root nodes... would probably help to pass it valid markup. I'm not sure if dom document cares... but it's a good suspect for why you are not getting behavior you expect.
[20:49:11] <renic> loadHtml() should be given a valid html document... not a snippet.
