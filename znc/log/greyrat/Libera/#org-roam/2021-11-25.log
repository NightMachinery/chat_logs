[11:35:29] <peutri> it's a simple ISBN13, is the expected format for that field documented somewhere? (couldn't find much in manual's “Citations”, unless I have to follow the link and reads the docs for org-ref too)
[11:47:42] <petrichor> I feel like I've missed some context for this question, but a valid isbn13 is 13 numerical digits 
[11:48:23] <petrichor> if you want to be thorough you can also validate the final check digit 
[11:48:46] <petrichor> and it's not unusual to group the digits with hyphens to aid human readability 
[11:52:18] <peutri> yeah, it's 13 digits and a hyphen
[11:52:53] <peutri> preceded by "ISBN-13:"
[11:54:34] <peutri> (have also tried lowercase, no "-13", no hyphen…)
[12:07:47] <petrichor> I think I missed some messages 
[12:08:25] <petrichor> where are you trying to put your isbn and what isn't working? I assume somewhere in an org-roam file?
[12:26:49] <peutri> I put it as a roam-key in this (yes, org-roam) note long ago; I just migrated to v2 so now apparently it's a ROAM_REFS properties; and it warns
[12:29:18] <peutri> so the current status is: I have "ISBN-13:123-4567890123" in a ROAM_REFS property in this file, and when I save it I get a Warning (org-roam): /path/to/file.org:1 Invalid ref ISBN-13:012-34567890123, skipping...
