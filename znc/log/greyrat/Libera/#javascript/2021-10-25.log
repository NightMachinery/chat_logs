[02:13:56] <fweht> i just found some thread about whether the order of setting image.src and image.onload makes a difference.  my impression was it shouldnt as all lines in a code block execute before the next event is processed, am i wrong here?
[02:14:27] <Decker> fweht I'd agree with that - why do you think it's not working that way?
[02:14:38] <Decker> if you reverse onload= and src= it does different things?
[02:14:53] <fweht> Decker: no it doesnt, at least not in chrome
[02:15:36] <Decker> no... the request isn't done until the JS thread falls of the execution stack
[02:15:43] <fweht> but someone in the thread argued that if the image is in the cache already then the onload event fires directly after setting src and before setting onload
[02:15:58] <fweht> ok cool!
[02:16:05] <Decker> ya I really don't think so
[02:16:10] <Decker> I've never seen anything like that
[02:16:37] <Decker> it may be that it is already loaded - so .src happens immediatly but then you won't get an onload because it already loaded

[08:38:57] <pavonia> I guess you need (args?: { ... }) then, and pattern match on args inside your function
[08:39:44] <sickdyd> pavonia: gotcha, I'll try that

[11:57:31] <Intelo> While doing integration test for api testing. What is a good way to test? a) make api call inside test code and also directly check (fetch/select) entries in database those were supposed to be created by that api cal. b) in response of real api call, always return json of objects created in database (e.g user created, even if its a GET call and 200
[11:57:32] <Intelo> response might have been ok, just to test what was created, I should return what was inserted / updated in database for each api call c) try to check one api with another api (this might not always be possible). e.g test create user api with user profile api. If user was created successfully, then profile api should return correct data.

[17:54:29] <stenno> i assume most of the current FN users come from places that reference irc but haven't changed the network name to libera yet
[17:56:10] <ljharb> stenno: #javascript there has 26 and #node.js there has 18.
[17:56:19] <ljharb> so the set of "current" is basically empty.
[17:56:28] <stenno> good good
[17:59:01] <ljharb> (and i didn't even look at those lists to see who there is already here, i'd bet it's not zero)
[17:59:32] <stenno> right
[18:00:41] <silly_> they brought freenode ##javascript down to 26 users?
[18:01:02] <ljharb> silly_: i mean "brought" suggests they did it on purpose
[18:01:14] <ljharb> altho to be fair that's a more believable explanation than what actually happened
[18:02:02] <ljharb> but yes, by banning IRCCloud, they knocked out a significant chunk of their active users, and then by disallowing non-bouncer connections to freenode unless you have an irc.com account, they knocked out 99% of their users, active or lurking
[18:02:22] <ljharb> so even if they'd had no policy changes people avoided on principle, those two choices took out almost the entirety of their userbase
[18:02:42] <silly_> well, if they have some new requirements like some account or bnc usage or w/e, then they essentially kicked a ton of stale or idle users
[18:02:58] <ljharb> also notably, freenode is no longer declaring itself the home for open source, now it's the online home of the joseon empire, which stopped existing in the early 1900s except to the family itself
[18:03:10] <ljharb> fun times
[18:04:01] <silly_> maybe it grows back when they start charging their users
[18:06:18] <silly_> imo, diversity is a good thing, nice to see how it plays out
[18:07:10] <silly_> (putting wasted money and effort aside)
[18:07:37] <ljharb> lol it's not in this case
[18:08:06] <ljharb> but also there's already always been tons of irc diversity. there's a reason virtually everyone's on the same network
[18:08:10] <ljharb> which is now this one

[18:50:42] <yin> ljharb: well i have a file which defined a lot of functions and i need to test them all in a separate module
[18:50:56] <yin> adding 'export' in front of all definitions seems more terrible
[18:51:03] <ljharb> yin: then fix the real problem - don't put that many things in one file
[18:51:09] <ljharb> also, don't test private things

[18:51:30] <yin> i see. thanks
[18:51:33] <ljharb> putting `export` in front of them is definitely not terrible
[18:51:48] <ljharb> or rather, the terrible part is exporting things just for testing - the use of `export` to do so is sublime

[19:04:19] <gkatsev> idk about vinyl vs lossless vs HQ mp3, but they've done sound tests with those super expensive audio cables and coat hangers

[19:05:41] <ljharb> (lossless-enough :-p)
[19:05:41] <gkatsev> not much difference, lol
[19:05:48] <ljharb> what i expected
[19:06:04] <ljharb> absent scientific evidence anyone can hear "warmness", i call bs
[19:06:07] <gkatsev> worth getting good cables, but not worth getting those $300 gold plated stuff
[19:06:13] <ljharb> right
[19:06:27] <gkatsev> I think the main thing about vinyl is really about the entire experience. Where you basically listen to the entire album and it's a lot more explicit.
[19:06:40] <ljharb> sure but i do that with mp3s
[19:06:47] <gkatsev> most people probably can't tell the difference
[19:07:03] <yin> i just ended up writing a repl save file with '.load x.js' and all my tests :p
[19:07:07] <ljharb> if you need to dedicate 2 square feet of shelf space, and physically move something around like a caveman, then that's weird
[19:07:09] <gkatsev> well, you don't go find the record and put it on the table and have the cover in front of you while lisetning
[19:07:18] <gkatsev> so, it's still not quite the same thing
[19:07:23] <ljharb> yin: lol way to avoid best practices
[19:07:27] <gkatsev> but not everyone necessarily wants that experience
[19:07:30] <ljharb> right
[19:07:49] <ljharb> gkatsev: but in that case you can buy digital vinyl players that give you the experience without needing all the analog junk
[19:08:01] <ljharb> gkatsev: so it's more than the physical experience, i think, it's also that people like being hipster
[19:08:05] <gkatsev> ljharb: but the whole point is that the analog stuff is _fun_
[19:08:07] <yin> ljharb: it's for a presentation. i'm writing a lambda library for demonstrating combinator calculus so i need to check everything is consistent
[19:08:19] <ljharb> yin: lol k
[19:08:25] <gkatsev> ljharb: but I agree that it's unlikely that it actually sounds better compared to lossless audio files
[19:08:31] <gkatsev> ljharb: definitely not to most people
[19:09:14] <yin> vinyl definetly sounds better
[19:09:44] <yin> if you are sensitive to it is another question
[19:10:05] <ljharb> yin: that's why i asked about a blind test
[19:10:14] <ljharb> yin: because i don't agree it's actually discernible

[19:12:36] <gkatsev> but they do point out that digital audio is superior in terms of dynamic range and longevity.
[19:12:55] <yin> gkatsev: that's not wrong

[19:13:08] <ljharb> obviously lossy encodings, the lossiness can make a difference
[19:13:26] <yin> well.. one problem is that "sounds better" is subjective
[19:13:51] <gkatsev> yup, which is why I mentioned "the experience" above
[19:13:53] <ljharb> right which is why a blind test removes that bias
[19:13:56] <yin> ljharb: lossless encodings are still "lossy" in a way
[19:13:56] <efdee> ... i just like vinyl because it forces me to be more involved with the music and it has bigger artwork.
[19:14:03] <ljharb> yin: not according to physics

[19:14:35] <ljharb> i am 100% ok with someone who likes vinyl but admits it's the same sound but a better experience

[19:16:17] <yin> gkatsev: that's also not wrong
[19:16:24] <ljharb> yin: if you can accurately label things as vinyl vs digital, without knowing what they are, then i'll believe it

[19:16:46] <ljharb> it's my entire point

[19:17:09] <ljharb> because digital *could* be mastered the same, or better.
[19:17:29] <ljharb> it's the luddite implication that modern technology can't be superior to slightly older technology that i'm pushing back on
[19:17:45] <yin> what about removing "mastering" from the equation?
[19:18:19] <ljharb> my claim is that if that's done, and it's a blind test, nobody can accurately tell the difference enough for it to be statistically significant.
[19:18:22] <gkatsev> digital is superior to vinyl in at least one way. It can last a long longer (even with bitrot)
[19:18:25] <yin> ljharb: oh i'm not saying that! i agree that newer technilogy can definelty be better

[19:19:26] <ljharb> they make claims like that the sound is "warmer" and "better" and they aren't talking about mastering, or about the experience

[19:26:41] <ljharb> lol you can absorb the info at 4x as easily as when reading visually?

[22:53:17] <stenno> ljharb: we were earlier thinking of situations where you had to cast to boolean explicitely
[22:53:54] <ljharb> only if an API explicitly cares about it being a boolean, which react rendering does in the case of 0 and 0n
[22:54:07] <ljharb> but it's a good hygiene practice to be explicit when returning things

[23:17:29] <kalen> anyone know how to reliably mock/spy an imported function from another module with jest, such that any invocation of that function will be intercepted? been scouring the web for a solution, but no one seems to have any since the references to that function are apparently different between modules or they're treated as "read-only"

[23:33:37] <kalen> ljharb, i have to step out to go eat. but i'll see if i can create a simple test case later. using jest.mock/spyOn for objects/methods works fine, but exported functions is an entirely different matter. i've tried most of the tricks i've seen suggested on the web, like `import * as lib from '../module';` and then attempting to mock lib.func, but that gives me read-only errors
