[04:45:36] <topoi> Is there some documentation on how to configure network best at Debian? More precise why is there a conflict between configuring devices with /etc/network/interfaces and NetworkManager (eg. nmcli)?

[04:55:49] <brachamh> thanks sney ! topoi you're best off just picking one method and setting it up properly
[04:56:19] <somiaj> debian provides lots of methods, the most common advise is choose one. /etc/network/interfaces is the debian tool that uses ifup/ifdown scripts, you also have network manager, networkd, connman, etc, just pick one and only use that.
[04:56:50] <somiaj> and pick the one you like, there really isn't a big difference which one you use in the long run

[05:05:50] <brachamh> ok i can't remember how this works: i updated my sources.list file to set everything to bullseye instead of buster, now it's saying: E: The repository 'http://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye/updates Release' does not have a Release file.

[05:09:06] <dpkg> There is no "bullseye/updates" repository for security updates. To reduce confusion with <bullseye-updates> (which is for other bug fixes), security updates are distributed via the <bullseye-security> repository "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main".

[05:33:12] <somiaj> But yes, it isn't in the best of state in debian at the moment, mostly due to amount of work it takes to create a new package and so far there haven't been any high risk/grave CVEs to hit
[05:33:23] <somiaj> google-chrome is an option if you trust google.

[05:34:08] *** Joins: tejr (~tejr@user/tejr)
[05:35:06] <somiaj> Unknown there. Usually it will only get updates because a high enough risk CVE hits, as opposed to getting regular updates. Though many disagree if the current CVEs should be considered high enough to push through a new version or not (along with just the effort it takes to package/test/ensure a package is ready for stable)
[05:36:01] <somiaj> mostly it is just many users don't agree with what the maintain/security team deems a high enough threat to push a new version or not
[05:37:27] <snoot> i understand, thank you

[05:39:34] <somiaj> Though it would be nice if there was a bit more communication about the state of chromium, but when I was last looking through the CVEs, most of the descriptions suggested they didn't affect debian (lots were for andriod)
[05:40:21] <somiaj> though some may and probably due, but have been classfied as either low or medium risk, so take that for what you will
[05:41:26] <snoot> i agree, i saw a bunch of posts on reddit and that made me unsure. i guess maintaining chromium must be hell

[05:42:26] <somiaj> Yea, some just look at the number of CVEs and think that just keep the browser up to date to ensure every possible fix is there. Though lots don't consider threat models when thinking about security either
[05:43:22] *** Joins: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher)
[05:43:32] <somiaj> anyways, I'm not saying it is in the best position in debian, though I do think there is a lot of crying of wolf, when really it is just a cyotee, and some decent communication about the state of chromium from the devs could help out a lot to at least let users know a bit better what Debian considers grave enough to push through a new version
[05:45:20] <somiaj> this time the random CVEs I clicked were mostly with extensions, so if you install untrusted extensions you could have issues
[05:46:44] <somiaj> that being said, I'm using firefox-esr
[05:48:05] <brachamh> i just started full-upgrade
[05:48:34] <somiaj> brachamh: it should be fine, all of my machines updated with no issues
[05:48:42] <brachamh> that's cool
[05:49:03] <somiaj> this is assuming you don't have thrid party packages messing things up, though reading the release notes is always helpful
[05:49:05] <brachamh> i've only been using debian since after buster came out
[05:49:26] <brachamh> yeah i went through the release notes, made a couple small adjustments, should be good
[05:50:12] <brachamh> before i started with debian, i was using ubuntu, started with 18.04 and upgraded to 20.04 as soon as it was available. that was a mistake
[05:50:25] <brachamh> but that's what made me switch to debian
[05:51:09] <somiaj> Ubuntu's univerise is my understanding of what can cause the issues. They mainly support a core system that works well and upgrades nicely, but then provide access to the univerise of packages which don't get the same level of testing

I have Intel 8260 wireless device on my notebook and I know that I need to have `firmware-iwlwifi' package installed to use the device, but I checked the Intel Support page (https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005511/wireless.html) which shows that the device driver is included in Linux Kernel in 4.1. So, my question is why Debian package maintainers separated the driver from the kernel?
[14:03:35] <sussudio> licensing issues.
[14:03:59] <berkhan> and also I need to included that some of users of Stretch do not need to install `firmware-iwlwifi'

[20:48:50] <PMT> If I had to wildly guess, grandfathering. Perhaps someone else will have a less wild guess.
[20:49:57] <somiaj> partly, partly some packages are common for people to want to build themselves, the kernel source is the often time
[20:50:21] <somiaj> basically this installs the source in /usr/src with debian patches, vs a source package, so it most likely won't contain the debian/ directory and be meant for compling locally
[20:50:48] <PMT> I can come up with reasons, but what makes people want to compile their own binutils?
[20:50:59] <somiaj> yea, binutils is an odd one
[20:51:33] <somiaj> is it mentioned in the change log?
[20:51:54] <PMT> I can think of a recent reason, but that's coreutils, not binutils, and that doesn't merit a -source.
[20:52:03] <n4dir> isn't it even a requirement for certain license you *have to* offer the source too?
[20:52:09] <somiaj> I do see Add a README.source file
[20:52:17] <PMT> n4dir: I mean, sure, but deb-src is a thing.
[20:52:25] <somiaj> n4dir: debian has source packages for that, this is a binary source package. which are rare

[20:54:02] <somiaj> All I'm sing is, Build a binutils-source package (containing the patched sources)., on april 2007, so there must have been a reason, though no bug report or mention of it
[20:54:06] <PMT> The package predates the git repo history, it seems.
[20:54:14] <PMT> Ah, yes, that's by quite a lot.
[20:54:49] <PMT> wow binutils-source is unpopular according to popcon
[20:54:52] <somiaj> but this is way after the package was created, so there must have been a reason users wanted the debian patched source that was not a source package.
[20:55:40] <somiaj> the main one I understand is the kernel, but yea binutils-source is an odd duck
[20:57:00] *** Quits: dvs (~Herbert@2607:f2c0:93c7:ff00:d063:eb64:221c:bd29) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:00:18] <furrymcgee> maybe there are build-depends, somehow like the -dev packages
[21:00:52] <PMT> If it were build-depends, they'd just be using source packages.
[21:00:57] <PMT> I think?
[21:01:13] <somiaj> Yea, build-depends are only for source packages
[21:01:24] <somiaj> this is using normal depends to pull in the build toosl needed
[21:01:38] <PMT> (Also, there's no rdepends on binutils-source that I see, for example.)
[21:01:51] <somiaj> maybe there are some rare uscases where building binutils and other packages with non standard build flags are useful, and this provides a way to do it locally vs roll your own package

[22:10:34] <brachamh> ok silly question, but i'm trying to set an icon for an app in bullseye with mate, but it won't take my custom icon
[22:11:03] <brachamh> it is a saved png image that i have scaled to the appropriate size
[22:11:38] <somiaj> 101---+
[22:12:30] <somiaj> set an icon where?
[22:12:51] <brachamh> on the main top panel
[22:13:08] <somiaj> in a menu, or on the system bar?
[22:13:20] <brachamh> system bar
[22:13:35] <somiaj> Is it the systray by chance, or just a launcher, though I don't know mate well enough on where to configure this
[22:13:43] <brachamh> launcher
[22:14:37] <brachamh> i think i just realized what the problem is
[22:16:43] <brachamh> nope. i thought the perms were wrong, but even after changing them it won't work. file is too big maybe?

[23:06:40] <rawtaz> question: im running `apt install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release` in a completely new and fully updated debian bullseye, and it tells me that ca-certificates and lsb-release are already at latest version.
[23:06:54] <rawtaz> thats fine. but it also tells me that it's setting the lsb-release package to "manually installed". thats fine too
[23:07:10] <rawtaz> but im wondering, why doesnt it set the ca-certificates to "manually installed" as well? i dont see the consistency
[23:07:33] <rawtaz> as in i dont see why it does so with lsb-release but not ca-certificates
[23:08:01] <rawtaz> hm, i should not that before this i did `apt install screen git` in case either of those somehow affected ca-certificates

[23:08:35] <somiaj> packages installed with the installer are all manual installed
[23:08:49] <somiaj> the auto flag only gets added to packages pulled in as dependencies after the initial base install
[23:09:04] <somiaj> well installed as base packages, tasksel makes things auto
[23:09:21] <rawtaz> here's the full output btw: https://kopy.io/plfik
[23:09:56] <somiaj> not needed, it is just ca-certificates is installed with the base system
[23:10:12] <rawtaz> perhaps im misunderstanding the message "lsb-release set to manually installed" - it is perhaps saying that lsb-release *is already* set to manually installed, rahter than that it is doing it now with this install?
[23:10:17] <rawtaz> right
[23:10:23] <rawtaz> is that since bullseye?
[23:10:47] <rawtaz> i was surprised that the docker installation instructions has ca-certificates in this install command, considering it's already part of the system

[23:15:59] <rawtaz> its a server but who knows what shenanigans the hosting provider did with it :D
[23:16:02] <somiaj> anyways, to me it is a non-issue, it is just a matter of when the package got installed
[23:16:15] <somiaj> well what is the output of 'aptitude why lsb-release'
[23:16:42] <rawtaz> yep its just cosmetics
[23:17:08] <rawtaz> hm i dont have have aptitude in the system
[23:17:11] <rawtaz> and apt doesnt have why
[23:17:33] <somiaj> so install aptitude. This is one feature of aptitude users wish would be included in apt in a future rlease
[23:17:41] <somiaj> but this will give you an idea of why lsb-release was installed
[23:18:08] <somiaj> but in general anyting installed with the intial debootstrap/base install in the installer are all marked as manual
[23:18:21] <rawtaz> im sorry but i dont want to install stuff i dont need in the long term
[23:18:24] <rawtaz> yeah that makes sense
[23:19:10] <somiaj> then anything pulled in as dependencies by apt (or tasksel) gets marked as manual
[23:19:30] <somiaj> and if you include a package in an install line, it assumes you want it to be manual so it would set it to be manual if it was installed and auto
[23:19:40] <rawtaz> yeah :)
[23:19:51] <somiaj> debian really doesn't use lsb-release, so I'm kinda surprised it was already installed.
