[02:37:58] <absentia> kinduff: how many notifications per minute are you looking at
[02:38:01] <kinduff> yes, im worried about that
[02:38:09] <pyzozord> those are two separate problems
[02:38:59] <pyzozord> cron has minute resolution, if your system allows to delay a message with 1 minute resolution then you are fine
[02:39:02] <kinduff> yes, small scale either work, it's not going to be in nanosecond precision, but it's how to avoid delaying messages and deliver them exactly when they are needed
[02:39:14] <pyzozord> then the trigger problem is not a problem, only scaling problem remains
[02:39:19] <kinduff> lets say 10,000 users snoozed a message for 5 minutes at the same time
[02:39:41] <pyzozord> then your problem is only with scaling
[02:39:46] <epony> first you have to find the other 9999 users
[02:39:55] <kinduff> yeah, that makes sense
[02:40:03] <absentia> kinduff: so... in 1 minute, cron job runs... nothing... 2 minutes... nothing...
[02:40:07] <pyzozord> cron will do, but must trigger multiple machines that can chew throught the 10k messages with x seconds (depending on how much you are comfortable with)

[02:42:36] <kinduff> bless u
[02:42:47] <kinduff> well, guess im going to stress test both to see how I can scale then
[02:42:49] <pyzozord> it's just about optimizing it
[02:42:58] <pyzozord> one thing you can do is precompute as much as you can
[02:43:03] <kinduff> thank you all for your input, very valuable 
[02:43:03] <pyzozord> trade time for space
[02:43:13] <pyzozord> don't make connections to db at the time of sending

[02:43:18] <kinduff> yes
[02:43:20] <kinduff> nice!

[02:43:56] <pyzozord> at the right time you only send the bits down the wire
[02:44:05] <pyzozord> 10k messages in ram is nothing
[02:44:06] <absentia> and then you can control dispatch rate simply by scaling workers up/down
[02:44:14] <pyzozord> 10k connections to db at the same time is worse

[04:43:46] <rm_rf> I find myself spending inordinate amounts of time fine tuning things to the point where I forget why I'm using Linux when shit just works on Windows. 
[04:43:58] <epony> you can also use rsync to "improve" your copy assurance, or think about using "tar" or some better method to not rely on external drives
[04:44:14] <epony> rm_rf, that problem is not only on Linux
[04:44:21] <rm_rf> Wait, how would tar help? Tar is for compression? 
[04:44:26] <epony> could be cabling and drivers and drives firmware too
[04:44:37] <rm_rf> I have to completely free up a drive and use it to hold a cloned image 
[04:44:43] <epony> tar is for making a "bundle" or an archive, compression is optional

[04:45:16] <epony> USB is a packet protocol, internal storage is.. much higher performance with a host adaptor
[04:45:39] <rm_rf> USB is also a specification for a type of bus 
[04:45:43] <epony> rm_rf, I haven't helped yet, you have to help yourself with diagnostic info
[04:46:36] <MsPooh> epony: ok well, the problem is we try to 'hide' details and sensitive information by using a server that the client can't see or have access to and prevent cross origin attacks etc. But what if instead, browsers instead had privileged digitally signed processes that were completely isolated. you couldnt just change headers or have cross site attack

[04:46:37] <MsPooh> because its its own kernel. you cant change it. then you simply run your javascript code in this isolated kernel process (which could in theory be remote but also local). the JS function is completely encrypted and replaces POST requests entirely. you cant modify it without knowing the global key that only the browser vendor knows
[04:46:39] <rm_rf> Yeah, that's sort of the nix philosophy isn't it? You can only save yourself and your own system. Stop relying on big tech to fix everything when they just want mindless control ...

[05:44:22] <absentia> loganlee[gnu]: not sure i know if dd'ing out to a different hard drive matters
[05:44:24] <epony> if you use the drive you wipe it / overwriting blockwise, otherwise it's like copy to a file piece by piece just the source can be a drive / filesystem, not just a file
[05:44:51] <absentia> what are you backing up exactly
[05:45:02] <epony> loganlee[gnu], the input and output can be drives, filesystems or files
[05:45:17] <loganlee[gnu]> absentia: i was thinking my whole computer where one hard drive mounted to / and the other to /home
[05:45:31] <absentia> loganlee[gnu]: why not just use rsync
[05:45:54] <absentia> is there a reason you really need a low-level bit-for-bit copy of your disk image

[05:46:26] <loganlee[gnu]> EdFletcher: ok
[05:46:41] <EdFletcher> like absentia says, unless you literally need a bit-for-bit copy you should be doing this at the filesystem level instead (e.g. with rsync) 
[05:46:54] <loganlee[gnu]> but i can dd the entire partitions right?
[05:46:55] <loganlee[gnu]> i see
[05:47:58] <EdFletcher> even dd'ing a full partition can be error-prone because some filesystems include partition headers that may vary between even minor versions of the filesystem because they are opaque to everyone but the implementation. dd'ing a whole partition will include that header.

[05:57:49] <EdFletcher> the other thing i forgot to mention earlier is that it's fundamentally discordant to use dd to backup a filesystem: a filesystem is structured data _on top of_ a raw block device, and using only dd is to entirely ignore that structure. if you know your data is structured, you should use it at the highest-level structure available (including when
[05:57:49] <epony> it works because of many iterations of fixes and improvements and abstraction and layered designs and use case augmentation
[05:57:49] <EdFletcher> making backups of it). 
[05:57:50] <MsPooh> on a byte level does it really matter?
[05:57:58] <MsPooh> until you 'interpret' the header

[05:58:08] *** Joins: rindolf (~shlomif@inkscape/dev/shlomif)

[09:28:32] <pokhu> taboo aspect of suicide, more from a natural perspective. like how scat is the ultimate perversion of the food chain, suicide felt like it would be completely diametrically opposite to the natural darwinian course of life. an interest in taboo was an interest in shock, so I was attracted to the emotions i would feel at the time. and also an immoral addiction made me feel a satisfaction from ending things as some kind of penance, bu

[11:42:31] <ejjfunky> but, how much to cache? 
[11:42:49] <arahael> VRChat here seems to cache roughly 20 GB.
[11:42:58] <DnzAtWrk> I think it may be a good idea to basically use an updates per second from the server
[11:43:04] <DnzAtWrk> Idunno, I'm not making a first-person shooter
[11:43:54] <DnzAtWrk> maybe just, proxy.updateState() which signals the client to send the state to the server, which sends the state on to all other clients, and then proxy.loadState()
[11:45:02] <pyzozord> ejjfunky: my teamlead
[11:45:18] <DnzAtWrk> a single state is enough cache

[11:57:11] <DnzAtWrk> how do you handle the creation, identification and destruction of synched objects
[11:57:42] <DnzAtWrk> I think a lot of games just make the world have a fixed number of entities
[11:57:49] <Decker> with a hashid or id
[11:57:49] <ejjfunky> DnzAtWrk, some sort of contract, i think.
[11:58:11] <GeDaMo> DnzAtWrk: there's often a maximum, yes
[11:58:19] <Decker> JSOX object storage would give the thing an ID.. so .put() when you want to update; and messages just come back and decode into the correc tobjects
[11:58:27] <pyzozord> ejjfunky: yes, on the side hobby it's probably programming, I tried having other hobbies but nothing stick

[12:02:07] <ejjfunky> i would say that hacker's mentality = scientist's mentality
[12:02:28] <ejjfunky> except hacker's has predominantly in technology
[12:02:31] <pyzozord> I would say they are two opposite ends

[12:03:15] <pyzozord> or maybe it's a square with two axes, knoweledge/dilligance
[12:03:17] <ejjfunky> GeDaMo, one tries to understand how technology works, the other tries to understand how law of physics work.
[12:03:30] <Decker> DnzAtWrk create command goes to server who's responseible for echoing it or blocking it and reporting back that they're not allowed
[12:03:38] <pyzozord> hackers have max knoweledge and very little diligance, scientists max knoweledge and a lot of diligance
[12:03:40] <ejjfunky> pyzozord, but why you say two opposite ends? this is interesting to me.
[12:04:02] <Decker> clients only then create things because the server told them to 
[12:04:03] <pyzozord> I have medium knoweledge and medium and I lean to the less diligance side
[12:04:21] <ejjfunky> hehehe. diligence is back to the person. there's diligence hackers and also not diligence scientists.
[12:04:35] <DnzAtWrk> Decker, I think that may be overkill. I want to have one admin which can create whatever, and several clients which can only control themselves
[12:04:41] <DnzAtWrk> and maybe potentially interact with certain things
[12:04:45] <DnzAtWrk> existing things
[12:04:46] <pyzozord> yeah maybe it was a too simplistic model
[12:05:02] <Decker> thenyou still need an account/user system to assign that - and know who is what
[12:05:14] <DnzAtWrk> it's not that important I think. First come is admin
[12:05:20] <DnzAtWrk> or maybe using a fixed pass
[12:05:47] <DnzAtWrk> that is a good point
[12:05:53] <DnzAtWrk> I need to have some kind of room id code then
[12:06:38] <ejjfunky> but i guess there's a difference. hackers try to get things done whatever it takes. the metaphor is from those who hack through a jungle, paving a way out
[12:06:48] <ejjfunky> so, they arent pretty
[12:06:58] <ejjfunky> engineer though, is a different animal.
[12:07:18] <pyzozord> yes yes

[12:55:46] <ProfSimm> scream: thanks to FormData and similar in JS I've completely changed how I work with forms in the browser. Forms in the browser were always this weird mix of presentational and business logic

[13:24:34] <Decker> we don't.
[13:24:40] <ProfSimm> OK
[13:24:40] <Decker> we say we could draw it on paper that way
[13:24:48] <scream> i demand to know why anyone uses async/await anyway, because man, i despise seeing that everywhere
[13:25:08] <ProfSimm> scream: because there's no better way to do async calls in JS
[13:25:14] <Decker> scream await is 'get value from promise' in C it'd just be *Promise or Promise[0]
[13:25:19] <scream> is event-structuring not possible? i guess js is the main problem

[13:25:41] <ProfSimm> The async/await vs not dichotomy is basically not wanting to redo the entire compilation so its async-away from the very start
[13:25:44] <ProfSimm> Which is unfortunate
[13:25:51] <Decker> it's ahndier than having to do Promise.then( ()=>{} ) because then that's not in a context to be able to assign a const... like const await db.getUser();

[13:26:28] <ProfSimm> Java will have async/await support without typing async/await
[13:26:38] <ProfSimm> This means all existing code in Java will be async-ready
[13:26:45] <ProfSimm> Even if it was written 20 years ago
[13:26:53] <Decker> it'd be nice if JS async getters automatically resolved without an await
[13:27:04] <Decker> (but could only be in an async funciton then)
[13:27:22] <davve> then they wouldnt be async
[13:27:23] <ProfSimm> Decker: yes, but we don't have to classify functions as sync and async
[13:27:41] <ProfSimm> Async all the things, then optimize some code as sync locally
[13:27:43] <Decker> davve they'd still BE async just not look like it
[13:27:45] <ProfSimm> Like JIT does
[13:28:00] <Decker> you don't technically in JS either... it could figure it out
[13:28:04] <ProfSimm> And like devirtualization of calls in Java works.
[13:28:14] <ProfSimm> We don't type "virtual" on methods in Java, but they're virtual.
[13:28:17] <Decker> but you'd have to make a difference between Waiting and The result of Waiting
[13:28:22] <Decker> so it can't be 100% transparent
[13:28:33] <Decker> unless that's the only behavior
[13:28:35] <ProfSimm> Decker: it could but it's much more involved for it to do that
[13:29:28] <Decker> ProfSimm well no, because sometimes I'd like to just save the promise anyway and move on without an await... eventually it'll trigger, but I can just tack on an extra .then() that fininished the assignment where the promise used to be

[14:22:28] <koollman> well, I don't see technical reasons for it to not be solvable
[14:22:30] <mrig> It is hard enough in a studio if you dont put everyone in the same room.
[14:22:55] <mrig> just putting people in booths has an effect on the result.
[14:23:20] <koollman> can't really get a live feed of other's stream with 0 latency, but you can play to a click track and/or previous recording
[14:23:21] <mrig> koollman: latency's that are tiny are an issue.
[14:23:35] <mrig> click kills it dead.
[14:24:06] <mrig> sure you can make music, but not perform live it would seem.
[14:25:26] <mrig> Live from a studio would work very well though, if they are all in the same room, even better.
[14:25:27] <koollman> why wouldn't you be able to perform live with a click track ? (although you can enhance that a bit, if you can manage some ordering. like drummer -> bass -> guitar -> singer, for example. each getting the previous ones, and then you assemble the whole stream with the right timing)

[15:02:41] <KillerWasp> hello random modern social media obsessive compulsive guys
[15:02:56] <vin> is there a difference between random and sequential SSD read-write latencies? 
[15:03:05] <vin> If so what is the typical range?
[15:04:13] <scream> the real difference is in the size of files
[15:04:31] <scream> there is no such thing as "sequential" in flash memory; it's intentionally randomized
[15:05:02] <scream> vin: what made you curious?
[15:05:07] <pyzozord> vin: I vaguely recall that sequential ops are faster
[15:05:24] <scream> what would even constitute a "sequential op" in this case, pyzozord?

[15:06:06] <scream> pyzozord: there is nothing exposed to the user that can ever allow physical locality to be influenced or guaranteed
[15:06:21] <pyzozord> scream: yeah, same with cpu cache, nothing is exposed

[15:06:38] <scream> the ssd encrypts and wear-levels. cpu cache can be manipulated by memory layout locality

[15:06:57] <scream> SSDs don't lay out like RAM does, aye?
[15:06:59] <user51> GeDaMo: one issue with the translation is that = is right associative. so i'm not certain if "n = n + 1" should be like "n 1 + n =" or "n n 1 + =".
[15:07:23] <scream> it's all so far away that it's impossible, compared to cache locality, which is also not even easy without given cache size

[20:52:18] <bjs> ProfSimm: yes there are trade-offs when you design things in languages, and those tradeoffs aren't always completely well know and sometimes people would design things differently.  But this case is one where there is a clear divide, between two different designs that different languages pick independently. 
[20:52:30] <DMZfreeZone> People slamming Stallman, Jobs, Gates etc 
[20:52:31] <alycidyne> perro_: I know, sadly I must use it where I work
[20:52:38] <perro_> yo tambien
[20:52:43] <DMZfreeZone> But some people are just never attacked. I never hear someone dissing the Woz for instance. 
[20:53:00] <bjs> ProfSimm: before Python had async/await it had libraries that implemented both ways of doing it, ways where you explicitly marked and ones where you didn't and could just yield anywhere (just like Lua).  Both were easy extensions to Python. 
[20:53:03] <absentia> DMZfreeZone: so you never got into this stuff until 5 years ago
[20:53:06] <ProfSimm> bjs: scratch out "independently", they mostly copied it from one another
[20:53:11] <absentia> and are now criticizing people who have been on the scene for 30, 40 years
[20:53:14] <absentia> for destroying the culture?
[20:53:22] <absentia> this is basically imperialist behavior
[20:53:22] <koollman> DMZfreeZone: I'm fairly sure you can find attacks against just about anybody
[20:53:24] <perro_> the cultur eis limiting ina lot of ways
[20:53:27] <perro_> see this room
[20:53:38] <DMZfreeZone> K, when you call your coworker a "faggot" dude. Yeah, not getting away with that shit in my book. 
[20:53:40] <perro_> only certain people are going to put up with the nit picky culture we have
[20:53:42] <DMZfreeZone> So, y eah, I'm gonna say that 
[20:53:45] <koollman> DMZfreeZone: some are more often attacked than others. Usually when they are more prominent, or more obviously making bad things
[20:53:45] <rindolf> DMZfreeZone: he has changed - https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/indiv-nodes/people-can-change.xhtmlhttps://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/indiv-nodes/people-can-change.xhtml

[20:53:50] <ProfSimm> bjs: maybeyou missed the async craze few years ago when everyone needed to have async/await "like X does"

[20:56:49] <DMZfreeZone> I don't care if you say fuck journalists. I'd say in the U.S. being a journalist is a pretty noble thing considering our free press and the fact that this is one of the few ways our goverment can be adequately policed.

[20:57:00] <koollman> Torvalds is a more interesting case, since he does apply the asshole behavior to himself too and do not react poorly when it is return. So, he kind of goes by the golden rule, just with a different score for what is acceptable or not :)

[21:17:17] <DMZfreeZone> I agree 
[21:17:24] <pyzozord> bjs: yes I think so too, but in this culture it is not ok
[21:17:41] <koollman> depends on the job and local culture
[21:18:08] <pyzozord> cultures can vary quite alot
[21:19:07] <pyzozord> but I can't be unauthentic either, somehow need to marry the two
[21:19:17] <koollman> but in most cultures I know of, while asking something (in any kind of tone) may be considered ok, answering the complete truth is rarely required
[21:19:40] <pyzozord> and also feel comfortable enough to be able to interact well and with good intentions
[21:19:48] <DMZfreeZone> So for all of that, you have to direct the tone of the conversation to allow such a level of openness
[21:20:01] <DMZfreeZone> You have to give social cues or indications that any given thing is or isn't OK. 
[21:20:16] <DMZfreeZone> Then no when to follow said cues from recipient 
[21:20:21] <DMZfreeZone> *know when 
[21:20:28] <koollman> there's an art to redirect the questionning to be more about the other person, or letting them know they should stop asking you such thing, or to move the discussion to something else
[21:20:40] <koollman> (and that is also culture-specific)

[21:57:50] <epony> these points are well known, you can't be just that naive and uneducated
[21:57:57] <Sqaure> wedr, java is great for a whole bunch of problems. But its not great when you rely on types and fight entropy. 
[21:58:02] <wedr> Sqaure, The point is, if you and your team has planned to do a rewrite using Haskell, I'm sure it will be better than the legacy software you were rewriting.
[21:58:10] <Stefan26> my experience is that most software jobs, the coding part is not the critical part for success, but the process of breaking down requirements etc... developing the right thing... I feel like the language is the least concern for success

They maintain a big version pool of big records where the types of these records are important. Also dependencies between records need to check out. Also new records are added yearly. Per application. And there are 50 such applications.

[22:59:13] <epony> the only downside is, you couldn't "poke" the lid and see the parser specification and fix it yourself

[22:59:26] <GeDaMo> FloridaMan: QuickBASIC? Or do you mean QBasic?
[22:59:34] <FloridaMan> Quick
[22:59:47] <FloridaMan> Although it's the same language but different editors
[22:59:49] <apotheon> QuickBASIC is an IDE with its own BASIC dialect.
[23:00:04] <apotheon> or s/is/was/ perhaps
[23:00:13] <apotheon> dunno if it still meaningfully exists
[23:00:14] <GeDaMo> QuickBASIC was the native generating compiler, QBasic was an interpreter which came with later versions of DOS
[23:00:16] <epony> same can be said for Object Pascal ;-)
[23:00:23] <FloridaMan> quickbasic and qbasic are the same with the exception that quickbasic can compile standalone EXE files
[23:00:38] <apotheon> Object Pascal has more enduring value than QuickBASIC.
[23:00:39] <vdamewood> FloridaMan: No, there are language differences too.
[23:00:46] <wedr> And now we can use SmileBASIC on our game consoles (Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo Switch)
