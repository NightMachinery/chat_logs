[02:40:09] <evilgohan2> so that blablabla-bla-bla-blaablablabla1 is "Some Artist"
[02:40:15] <evilgohan2> and blablabla-bla-bla-blaablablabla2 is "Some Artist"
[02:40:34] <evilgohan2> just be careful to not run into constraint errors on the fields themselves ;)

[06:53:04] <Myself> yeah /dev/random is the bottleneck there, not the drive 
[06:54:56] <Selavi> yeah I just zero
[06:55:15] <thddx> usually all i do as well
[06:55:57] <thddx> i'll write zeros to it tomorrow and compare
[06:56:38] <thddx> it should hit 100ish
[07:00:02] <sarnold> I'd trust zeros for my own reuse
[07:00:11] <sarnold> but I wouldn't trust zeros before giving the drive away
[07:01:37] <Hydragyrum> ^
[07:01:46] <rmmh> just encrypt all your drives 
[07:01:48] <Hydragyrum> honestly I wouldn't trust a single pass of random even
[07:01:51] <Hydragyrum> but also 
[07:01:54] <rmmh> then you only have to wipe the headers :) 
[07:01:59] <sarnold> rmmh: that makes unattended reboots a pain in the ass
[07:02:02] <Hydragyrum> you really don't need good random data for it
[07:02:03] <sarnold> it's a good point though
[07:02:32] <rmmh> sarnold: you could store the key on your boot drive for convenience 
[07:02:34] <sarnold> Hydragyrum: yeah, I kinda want something like dd if=debian.iso of=/dev/sda repeat=as-much-as-needed  :)
[07:02:34] <Hydragyrum> a common way to wipe drives is create a luks volume spanning the entire drive and write zeros to the unlocked volume
[07:03:34] <Hydragyrum> use a random key (just keysmash or w/e) and then repeat the whole process as much as needed
[07:08:23] <rmmh> why is that better than urandom
[07:08:41] <Hydragyrum> because then you don't waste your entropy
[07:08:49] <rmmh> that's a meme
[07:09:09] <rmmh> because tso isn't a cryptographer
[07:09:11] <Hydragyrum> I mean, if you're using the wrong random (it's really easy to mix up random and urandom) then you'll block a lot
[07:09:16] <rmmh> sure
[07:09:47] <rmmh> you can probably pipe some openssl command for the same effect 
[07:10:22] <Hydragyrum> and the standard used in automatic crypto-luks installs and the like is the way I mention

[07:11:38] <sarnold> ready.
[07:11:40] <Hydragyrum> very helpful title lol
[07:11:51] <Hydragyrum> thx
[07:11:57] <sarnold> aka: what the fucking thing should have been 25 years ago
[07:13:33] <rmmh> sarnold: oh nice, thanks for the update
[07:14:10] <rmmh> sarnold: there was an android phone where the ui objects were getting uuids from /dev/random
[07:14:32] <rmmh> and setting up a background process to pipe /dev/urandom into /dev/random increased the UI framerate by like 30%
[07:14:54] <rmmh> Hydragyrum: it's not lag, I was typing on a phone >:[
[07:15:17] <sarnold> rmmh: *ouch*
[07:15:23] <sarnold> rmmh: that's just .. ouch :)
[07:15:34] <Hydragyrum> yeah phone typing is ouch
[07:15:46] <rmmh> , <backspace> swipe "bang"
[07:16:06] <rmmh> sarnold: I will try to update my linux lore to remember this now
[07:16:10] <sarnold> :)
[07:16:20] <rmmh> filing it next to "-o intr is a noop on nfs, dummy"
[07:16:32] <rmmh> and has been for ... 16 years now?
[07:17:01] <sarnold> yay! that was bloody annoying :)
[07:17:16] <rmmh> it's not a no-op because nfs calls are interruptible now
[07:17:24] <rmmh> it's because they removed the possibility of interrupting them
[07:18:37] <sarnold> oh even better
[07:19:20] <rmmh> so you can still get nfs zombies
