[00:03:07] <ology> If you are going to use -e and print, might as well add a -l too

[00:07:21] <LeoNerd> It is somewhat annoying how -e and -E work
[00:07:31] <LeoNerd> They take a string argument immediately,  -e'some code here'
[00:07:50] <LeoNerd> It would have been a bit nicer for it to just be a boolean flag, that says the next "program" argument is in fact literal code
[00:08:01] <LeoNerd> But rather too late to change that now

[16:50:05] <LeoNerd> I'm not sure where to begin

[16:55:35] <ehuelsmann[m]> (And I'd love to know too :) )
[16:56:16] <LeoNerd> I've already added it. 5.14
[16:56:36] <ehuelsmann[m]> thanks. that's "old enough."
[16:56:47] * GumbyPAN CPAN Upload: App-efm_perl-0.01 by DELPHINUS https://metacpan.org/release/DELPHINUS/App-efm_perl-0.01
[16:57:00] <ehuelsmann[m]> I was surprised to read yesterday that "/r" was added in 5.12. I thought I figured out the other day that it was 5.14.
[16:57:27] <ehuelsmann[m]> although the general consensus in the ecosystem seems to be that "5.14 should be old enough now"
[16:58:04] <LeoNerd> In practice I don't really remember what was pre-5.14. It's all "too old"
[16:58:05] <ehuelsmann[m]> which opens up the ability to use a number of nice enhancements.
[16:58:34] <LeoNerd> 5.14 was when custom keywords became actually useful
[16:59:07] <LeoNerd> 5.16 adds a bunch of pad-related API that makes a bunch of the keyword things better... so either of those is usually a good limit
[17:00:22] <ehuelsmann[m]> I've been hesitant to upgrade Test::BDD::Cucumber from 5.10 to 5.14, but I think the point where I really want to set a higher minimum bar gets closer fast: especially your language-enhancing modules are great for coding productivity.
[17:00:54] <LeoNerd> Hrm.. I appear to have set meta_merge but nothing happens...
[17:01:24] <ehuelsmann[m]> For my end-user applications, I've set the minimum bar much higher 5.2x at least.
[17:01:41] * ehuelsmann[m] checks the Module::Build docs
[17:01:43] <LeoNerd> Oh, yah a lot of my actually useful code is set to 5.26+ because that's when XPS can handle sub signatures
[17:01:57] <LeoNerd> So I can write  async method do_thing($x, $y) { ... }
[17:03:05] <LeoNerd> I _could_ drag that back to 5.20 if I really cared but honestly I don't think there's anyone who'd want to use new things but is stuck on 5.{20,22,24}
[17:03:47] <ehuelsmann[m]> even Debian has a recent Perl these days. No, neither can I.

[18:52:03] <simcop2387> next step is to take my current spam markings and turn them into an easier to use column on each post to build up the training data
[18:52:07] <ehuelsmann[m]> one of the important findings of the spambayes project was that there are basically 2 dimensions to classify input by (which is not what e.g. spamassassin does): "is this spam" and "is this ham"
[18:52:33] <ehuelsmann[m]> if the answer to both is "yes" or the answer to both is "no", then manual learning is required.
[18:52:36] <simcop2387> StayHungry: not using that for spam but i do have the data to do that i think.  will probably try to make some stuff for that for fun after i finish this bit (making the training weights)
[18:52:51] *** Quits: ircuser-1 (~Johnny@71.63.241.168) (Quit: because)
[18:53:11] <ehuelsmann[m]> I liked that about spambayes, which made it more effective than spamassassin.
[18:53:27] <ehuelsmann[m]> (which needs continuously updated rules to make / keep it effective?)
[18:53:40] <simcop2387> ehuelsmann[m]: yep that's where i decided that my original plan of doing that "math" inside PG directly wasn't worth the trouble and i'll just do it in perl.  AI::NaiveBayes should be able to give me that data too.

[18:54:54] <simcop2387> after i get this bit of stuff done i'm going to then also go update my banned isps list to include anything with VPN and VPS in the names.  they're rather good for banning announcements in channels.
[18:56:40] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. I'd be interested to learn how well the solution works.

[18:57:29] <simcop2387> ehuelsmann[m]: me too :) it'll be open source so it'll be "easy" to replicate, and yea some kind of stats page does sound interesting.
[18:58:41] <simcop2387> might actually be a reason to put a small minion thing inside the pastebin now actually.  do the retraining in the background and limit how often and then update stats.

[19:02:20] <StayHungry> i see messages from GumbyPAN, what are they?
[19:02:37] <ehuelsmann[m]> StayHungry: release notifications.
[19:02:48] <simcop2387> gumbypan announces when people release a module to cpan, or a new users joins cpan

[19:04:11] <ehuelsmann[m]> vague: heh.
[19:05:35] <StayHungry> always something is happening there... more alive then heir Raku :)
[19:08:04] <ehuelsmann[m]> does Raku have their own xPAN? 
[19:08:15] <ehuelsmann[m]> or are we sharing CPAN?
[19:08:42] <ehuelsmann[m]> in case of the latter, does GumbyPAN filter out those announcements? (And does MetaCPAN too?)
[19:11:33] <StayHungry> i met Raku just this morning, while exploring syntax languages on Wikipedia. weird nobody mentioned it on multiple programming channels here.
[19:12:11] <ehuelsmann[m]> I guess that's a long story :-/
[19:12:16] <StayHungry> its syntax is more similar to how I think, but it takes 250ms to launch, whereas Perl does it for 30ms

[19:16:25] <simcop2387> and some pretty reasonable ones that should probably be spam in the all list
[19:16:42] <simcop2387> xenu: you're mentioned 1182 times among all the posts on the site

[19:19:12] <simcop2387> ehuelsmann[m]: that's total occurance account, not total post count.  so mentioned multiple times in a post.  it's been used for irc logs quite frequently

[19:44:07] <thrig> I know some coffee shops that reset connections unless you lower the lag_check_time to 30s in irssi
[19:46:29] <ology> A handy part of my music bot is to generate mp3s in a public sandbox and hand back a link. But that is restricted to a couple users. Opening it up to the unwashed masses may be problematic.
