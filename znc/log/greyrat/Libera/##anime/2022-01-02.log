[04:25:28] <MootPoot> although I do regret selling my 1080 at the time, but I needed the cash to pay for the 3080
[04:25:41] <MootPoot> was 1050 for me
[04:25:53] <MootPoot> the founders were gone in seconds
[04:26:01] <ButterNoodle> I still run 1070s in stuff
[04:29:10] <ButterNoodle> there will probably be some kinda of stocking error and I will get a refund for it
[04:29:58] <MootPoot> the only gpu I have personally is my 3080
[04:30:06] <MootPoot> I guess - one I can move around
[04:30:17] <MootPoot> there is that laptop 1050 but I doubt that counts

[05:17:33] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: yeah tastes kind of like breaddy
[05:18:11] <Fenderbassist> I think mixed nuts (cashews, almonds, brazil nuts, hazelnuts, pecans) can serve that purpose as well in small amounts
[05:18:24] <Fenderbassist> 7 grams carbs per 1/4 cup

[05:33:05] <Fenderbassist> then do it
[05:33:08] <amigojapan> MootPoot: drink water
[05:33:09] <Fenderbassist> MootPoot: drink water
[05:33:14] <Fenderbassist> (in stereo)
[05:33:44] <MootPoot> Probably the diet
[05:34:02] <Fenderbassist> keto, from what I've read, requires more water and salt intake
[05:34:10] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: did I tell you my plan to make an anime classifying app, but similar to the political compass?
[05:34:15] <Fenderbassist> you don't have carbs making you retain water
[05:34:25] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: no, cool
[05:35:08] <Satin> mmm third one didn't taste that great for some reason
[05:35:11] <Fenderbassist> sounds like a fun project
[05:35:14] <Satin> maybe because i was reusing the oil and stuff from the first two
[05:35:14] <amigojapan> Yeah Fenderbassist you can hardly tell what kind of anime you are going to watch with current systems
[05:35:56] <Fenderbassist> Satin: I've bought chicken that varied in flavor within the same bag due to "rib meat" / dark meat among the white meat
[05:36:07] <Satin> hmm i see
[05:36:10] <Fenderbassist> different flavor and consistency
[05:36:24] <Fenderbassist> another reason why I cook meats, especially chicken, well done
[05:36:35] <Satin> it was starting to look burntish
[05:36:44] <Satin> but that's probably from the stuff in the oil
[05:36:47] <Satin> from the previous two
[05:36:49] <Fenderbassist> could have been yes
[05:36:53] <Satin> deceieving me
[05:37:02] <Fenderbassist> cooking is always a learning experience for me
[05:37:07] <Satin> same so far
[05:37:13] <Fenderbassist> some brands of chicken better than others
[05:37:22] <Satin> i see
[05:37:58] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: don't know about others but during keto I really miss the taste of carbs
[05:37:59] <Fenderbassist> anyway good on you for eating
[05:38:04] <Fenderbassist> glad your 2 day fast is over
[05:38:09] <Fenderbassist> you need protein
[05:38:18] <S_T_A_N> I solve that problem by eating carbs
[05:38:36] <Satin> thank you
[05:38:44] <amigojapan> Lol S_T_A_N then you are not doing keto
[05:38:44] <Satin> i tried not to go overboard with the chic  fil A sauce which has carbs
[05:38:47] <Satin> but other than that, yeah
[05:38:57] <S_T_A_N> I am. but I have cheat years
[05:39:06] <Fenderbassist> mayo or cheese works nicely, I've found
[05:39:09] <amigojapan> I see S_T_A_N 
[05:39:14] <Fenderbassist> when I did keto, I used mayo often on meats
[05:39:24] <Satin> may has carbs too i thought
[05:39:31] <Fenderbassist> hardly
[05:39:34] <S_T_A_N> amigojapan: I have an annual cheat year
[05:39:36] <Satin> WTF
[05:39:39] <Fenderbassist> I'll check mine, one sec
[05:39:40] <Satin> WHY AM I NOT USING THE MAYO
[05:39:49] <Satin> i happen to have a bottle of mayo sitting near my computer
[05:39:50] <Satin> on my desk
[05:39:51] <amigojapan> Lol S_T_A_N 
[05:39:54] <Satin> it says 0g carbs
[05:39:56] <Satin> HOLY fUCK
[05:40:04] <Satin> MootPoot: ButterNoodle why were you guys saying to avoid mayo then
[05:40:10] <Satin> the calories?
[05:40:30] <Fenderbassist> Helmans / Best brand, 0 carbs
[05:40:32] <S_T_A_N> I am keto most of the time, except for once a year every year for a year
[05:40:40] <Satin> I have Great Value
[05:40:49] <ButterNoodle> Satin: naaa
[05:40:52] <ButterNoodle> never avoid the mayo
[05:40:59] <amigojapan> Satin: ButterNoodle said he does not count calories
[05:41:00] <Satin> i'm confused you guys were talking once
[05:41:03] <Satin> about alternatives to mayo
[05:41:04] <Satin> I guess not
[05:41:07] <Satin> amigojapan: I don't count either
[05:41:12] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot was buying that dog shit olive oil mayo
[05:41:12] <Satin> or don't count much at least
[05:41:17] <Satin> ButterNoodle: oh lol
[05:41:32] <ButterNoodle> yea dont use that
[05:41:46] <Satin> amigojapan: actually now that I think about it, I do count
[05:41:57] <Satin> but not that closely as i used to, since i know i'm eating far less in general
[05:42:22] <Fenderbassist> if you're doing keto and you eat chicken, you definitely need mayo with it
[05:42:25] <amigojapan> Satin: are you doing keto?
[05:42:28] <Fenderbassist> chicken is so low fat
[05:42:34] <Fenderbassist> it needs cheese or mayo or both
[05:42:49] <ButterNoodle> I love cheese
[05:42:53] <Satin> I probably had like close to 640 calories or something like that 
[05:42:59] <Satin> assuming each chicken thigh is 206
[05:43:00] <Fenderbassist> me too
[05:43:19] <Satin> buying provolene cheese from dollar general was a fail
[05:43:21] <Satin> it tastes bleh
[05:43:32] <Satin> I should have just gotten pepperjack from walmart, damm me
[05:43:39] <Fenderbassist> next time
[05:43:45] <Satin> tru
[05:43:49] <Satin> amigojapan: kind of
[05:43:51] <Fenderbassist> life is always about learning
[05:44:01] <Fenderbassist> I've learned a lot because I've made many many many mistakes
[05:44:01] <Satin> I say kind of because I haven't been consistent with low carbs, a soda here, and there
[05:44:13] <Satin> I avoid outright carbs like buns and breads and what not
[05:44:21] <Fenderbassist> switch out club soda for the cola
[05:44:22] <Satin> but def not doing a good job with other sources
[05:44:24] <Fenderbassist> no carbs
[05:44:26] <Satin> yeah
[05:44:33] <Satin> there was one night after christmas where i had some
[05:44:48] <Fenderbassist> it's all a learning experience
[05:44:52] <Fenderbassist> and you have Butter for recommendations
[05:44:53] <Satin> but def doing low calories lol
[05:44:57] <Fenderbassist> so it's all good
[05:44:57] <Satin> so i'm not too concerned
[05:44:59] <Satin> yeah true
[05:45:05] <amigojapan> Satin: if you are eating less than 50g of carbs per day, you are doing keto. In which case you need fat which is high in calories
[05:45:13] <Fenderbassist> you'll succeed in the long run, which is what we all need to do
[05:45:19] <Satin> I'm doing under 50g for sure
[05:45:23] <Satin> but i want under 5g
[05:45:25] <Fenderbassist> then you're fine
[05:45:32] <Satin> man this one strip of gum has 1g of carbs lol
[05:45:35] <Fenderbassist> you have nothing to worry about
[05:45:38] <Satin> trident*
[05:45:40] <Satin> orbits don't
[05:45:45] <Satin> Fenderbassist: true
[05:47:30] <amigojapan> Ok I am going to the super market before tomako wakes up... Will take my phone with me...
[05:47:43] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: safe travels
[05:47:50] <Fenderbassist> get some gloves at 7-11
[05:47:53] <amigojapan> Ty Fenderbassist 
[05:48:06] <Satin> I've been pretty good about following up on goals recently
[05:48:06] <amigojapan> Ok thanks Fenderbassist 
[05:48:09] <Satin> and routines
[05:48:13] <Fenderbassist> ditto
[05:48:15] <Satin> well not that good, but getting into the rhythm
[05:48:22] <Satin> with one exception: studying
[05:48:33] <Satin> all the excercising and stuff's got me drained 
[05:48:47] <Fenderbassist> I imagine you have some time before classes resume?
[05:48:49] <Satin> and self studying is already pretty hard if it's something not naturally in my domain like humanities stuff
[05:48:51] <Satin> yeah
[05:48:53] <Satin> 18 days
[05:48:58] <Fenderbassist> so then, you have tomorrow to start
[05:49:02] <Satin> which is pretty low for trying to get through 4 textbooks
[05:49:03] <Satin> yeah
[05:49:18] <Fenderbassist> just start with a page, and you'll move from there
[05:49:33] <Satin> true, just got to pin the mindset right, and have lots of patience
[05:49:37] <Fenderbassist> getting started is the key, once you do you'll get your rhythm
[05:49:52] <Fenderbassist> it's just another experience
[05:50:07] <ButterNoodle> *the rhythm method
[05:50:08] <Fenderbassist> do the work first thing, and treat yourself to fun later in the day
[05:50:13] <Fenderbassist> rinse and repeat
[05:50:26] <Fenderbassist> every day is a success and a treat
[05:50:29] <Fenderbassist> win win
[05:50:39] <Fenderbassist> become used to always succeeding
[05:50:40] <Satin> I don't know if it's the PTSD or what but I often stress myself over insignificant details when it comes to stuff like this
[05:50:56] <Fenderbassist> thinkers often stress themselves over the details
[05:50:56] <Satin> and it bothers me till i have a release with games or whatever (to be fair, only resumed playing videogames recently for the first time in ages)
[05:51:06] <Satin> almost like avoidant stuff
[05:51:08] <Fenderbassist> but it also signifies their strength
[05:51:14] <Satin> yeah i'm pretty neurotic
[05:51:21] <Fenderbassist> most people I think are, in some way
[05:51:28] <Fenderbassist> I know I am
[05:51:40] <Fenderbassist> super detail oriented in some ways, lazy in others
[05:51:45] <Fenderbassist> it's a balancing act

[05:53:45] <Fenderbassist> just be careful
[05:54:07] <Fenderbassist> Satin: that is one of the longitudinal lessons of life
[05:54:15] <Fenderbassist> one that we often have to relearn
[05:54:23] <Satin> for sure
[05:54:31] <Fenderbassist> but relearning it makes us stronger
[05:54:43] <Fenderbassist> you are so much stronger now than when I first met you online
[05:54:49] <Fenderbassist> look how far you've come
[05:54:54] <Fenderbassist> in a handful of years
[05:54:59] <Fenderbassist> that should be very inspiring to you
[05:55:14] <Fenderbassist> the first time I PM'ed you to now
[05:55:18] <Fenderbassist> that is a lot of growth
[05:55:29] <Fenderbassist> yes?
[05:55:32] <Satin> For sure. I've always had loud background noise and thoughts, but learning to adapt and negotiate is part of adulthood for sure
[05:55:56] <Fenderbassist> so if you've made that much progress from the past to now, you will make a lot of progress into the future
[05:56:45] <Fenderbassist> as long as you keep trying, you can't fail
[05:56:49] * Satin hopes so! 
[05:56:56] <Fenderbassist> you will succeed
[05:57:18] <Fenderbassist> because you haven't quit on yourself
[05:57:20] <Fenderbassist> so you will win
[05:58:43] <Fenderbassist> you have endured much, and gotten this far, you will continue
[05:59:03] <Satin> for me at least, it's a lot of cycles, almost like capitalistic boom and busts
[05:59:16] <Fenderbassist> just like for most people
[05:59:28] <Satin> that's just me, I don't know how it's like for other people, but I've become better at absorbing the busts and moving forward as well as i can
[05:59:30] <Fenderbassist> read books from 100-200 years ago, was true then
[05:59:35] <Satin> heh 
[05:59:36] <Fenderbassist> libravox.org
[05:59:44] <Fenderbassist> audio books in the public domain, classics
[05:59:48] <Fenderbassist> read about how people lived then

[06:01:15] <omero> eh... good question Satin 
[06:02:49] <omero> also.. its day 2 here :P
[06:03:23] <omero> you know... that GMT stuff...
[06:04:49] <omero> amigojapan: what was all that about yamato? hey... seems I missed some interesting conversations :)
[06:05:58] <omero> havent been too well in the past days... that is no excuse but it could explain ... not been around much.
[06:08:25] <Satin> i see
[06:08:26] <omero> Fenderbassist: do you still play along with those things? I have a couple. and my favorite player, Anthony Francis Pastorious III (alias Jaco). Weather Reports. Birdland :)
[06:10:33] <omero> but I switched to ibanez... the woods are so much better
[06:12:17] <omero> fenders are still the best tho. I agree with that... but ... not that agile to be five against one ;)
[06:12:18] <Fenderbassist> omero: I play with Fender Precision basses these days, and yes Jaco is awesome
[06:12:26] <Fenderbassist> he was an amazing player and died way too young
[06:12:48] <Fenderbassist> well....there are so many great basses, it depends on what a person wants to do
[06:13:05] <Fenderbassist> go on Talkbass.com and you'll see an endless assortment of basses people use :)
[06:13:06] <omero> yeah... one shouldnt start brawling in NY
[06:13:31] <Fenderbassist> was sad that Jaco was killed by a bouncer while trying to get in a club
[06:13:43] <Fenderbassist> a terrible loss of a great talent
[06:13:45] <omero> sad
[06:14:08] <Fenderbassist> the dude was on a whole other level
[06:14:15] <omero> he "invented" the fretless
[06:14:37] <Fenderbassist> Bill Wyman made one by pulling frets out of a neck he bought, Jaco brought it to the masses
[06:14:38] <omero> with a hammer and a scrwedriver...
[06:14:44] <Fenderbassist> made it mainstream
[06:14:56] <Fenderbassist> Tony Franklin did later, with The Firm and other groups
[06:15:18] <omero> rush. does that ring any bastille day?
[06:15:19] <Fenderbassist> there will be only one Jaco
[06:15:30] <Fenderbassist> I played a ton of Rush songs over the years

[09:05:34] <Fenderbassist> Dr. Robert Mallone, which developed one of them, is now against is, leads me to doubt
[09:05:46] <Fenderbassist> against it*
[09:05:57] <Fenderbassist> information also hasn't been very available
[09:06:16] <Fenderbassist> the FOIA request regarding the vaccines got a 55 year delay request
[09:06:19] <Satin> Yep, and he's also disagreed with by consensus. He was certainly not the only contributer by any means. His research was useful decades ago, but the chain of research in science that has peer reviewed does not include him since
[09:06:20] <Fenderbassist> also leads me to doubt
[09:06:33] <Fenderbassist> so it's not a very clear picture
[09:07:01] <Fenderbassist> anyways, agree with you on not arguing
[09:07:10] <Fenderbassist> so we can stop here :)
[09:07:11] <Satin> yeah
[09:07:28] <Fenderbassist> I don't think anyone (yet) has a clear picture
[09:07:43] <Fenderbassist> I would love nothing more than the vaccines being effective for the sake of all people
[09:07:46] <Fenderbassist> that would be the best reult
[09:07:49] <Fenderbassist> result*
[09:08:08] <Fenderbassist> to protect everyone
[09:08:31] <Fenderbassist> will see
[09:09:01] <Fenderbassist> regarding Ivermectin, despite the plea to Congress to review their findings, didn't happen
[09:09:23] <Fenderbassist> but have (anectodal) friends who got very sick and used Ivermectin to beat it
[09:09:26] <Satin> Why would there need to be a plea to Congress when most health bodies disprove of it
[09:09:28] <Fenderbassist> so who knows?
[09:10:22] <Satin> The people who *actually* know what's going on, who study these things all their life are clear cut that vaccines are effective, and treatments such as Ivermectin are not.

[09:10:48] <Fenderbassist> but take it as you will
[09:11:16] <Satin> If one "seeks too hard" or wishes to be told something else, there's plenty of alternative narratives, which don't hold much weight, as we live in an age of the internet and disinformation. Cherrypicked statements, fringe scientists, data, and more. 
[09:11:27] <Fenderbassist> that's one view
[09:11:30] <Fenderbassist> there might be others
[09:11:47] <Fenderbassist> anyways, have a good night, am gonna hop off and get some sack time :D
[09:11:53] <Satin> I'm not suggesting everything that is established is to be trusted, but there is plenty to believe that consensus, especially in the medical field, is more important than those who sell snake oil, which is a tale as old as time.
[09:11:57] <Satin> fair, gn

[09:13:03] <Satin> he's thinking a drug used for horses is used to treat covid
[09:13:52] <ButterNoodle> well the drug used to actually prevent covid, is not doing its job.. there are only a few absolute facts we can rely on from statistical information
[09:14:38] <ButterNoodle> 1. people w certain health conditions are susceptible to long term effects from covid - and even death
[09:14:45] <ButterNoodle> 2. re-infection is possible
[09:15:25] <ButterNoodle> 3. for the healthy it is not a death sentence - ranging response to infection
[09:15:31] <ButterNoodle> 4. everyone is stupid
[09:16:22] <ButterNoodle> in short, I'll tell everyone in the class.. manage ur own risk how u see fit - however not in a way that manages some else's risk
[09:17:10] <Satin> things like this affect everyone
[09:17:18] <Satin> fuck individualism in situations like this
[09:17:22] <ButterNoodle> like I said
[09:17:32] <Satin> there's people dying in hospitals because all the covid patients are filling it up

[09:17:54] <Satin> horse treatment drug ain't doing shit
[09:18:02] <ButterNoodle> probably not..
[09:18:06] <Satin> all these people not getting the vaccine and fucking it up for everyone else are fucking all of us
[09:18:12] <ButterNoodle> dont buy stock in that
[09:18:20] <ButterNoodle> that's also an untruth
[09:18:27] <Satin> it is true.
[09:18:47] <Satin> my physics grad friend's mom had to stay in the ER for 2-3 days despite having serious medical condition
[09:18:50] <Satin> because all the covid patients
[09:18:52] <Satin> are filling everything up
[09:18:55] <Satin> all the beds are filled up
[09:19:04] <ButterNoodle> by the vaccinated? explain to me how that works
[09:19:15] <Satin> The majority are unvaccinated.
[09:19:24] <ButterNoodle> every documented case of omicron when it broke out in the US was by the vaccinated
[09:19:30] <ButterNoodle> thats untrue also
[09:19:39] <Satin> The vaccine doesn't ensure 100% transmission reduction, but it is *very* effective

[18:14:56] <emmeka> Kinsey scales ranks everyone from 1-6, with 1 being 100% straight and 6 being totally absolutely gay. He then did an experiment on like 10,000 people to determine their gayness that is amazing
[18:15:38] <emmeka> he basically would get people to sign up as research volunteers, and then hook them up to various monitors, and then without telling them, put on porn (either gay or straight) and measure their response
[18:15:46] <emmeka> so that people couldn't lie about it
[18:16:07] <amigojapan> emmeka: those studies seem to be really old. And in a time it was more taboo too
[18:16:24] <emmeka> amigojapan they are, but, he didn't *ask* people's sexuality
[18:16:38] <amigojapan> I see
[18:16:40] <emmeka> he measured it involuntarily. no study like it has ever really been done since.
[18:17:10] <Sadale> emmeka, lol that's a funny way of researching people's behavior xD

[18:19:08] <amigojapan> Ah ok. I did not know that is what it was emmeka 
[18:22:56] <emmeka> but anyway, the more interesting part of Kinsey's findings is that he found male homosexuality to be far more common than female. His measurements suggested ~12% of adult men are bi, 10% are gay. But with women, between 4-7% are bi (his measurements gave 4% as the figure for married women, 7% for single), and somewhere from 3%-9% of women are lesbians.
[18:23:19] <emmeka> modern day, we kind of assume the opposite. that lesbians are really common.
[18:24:30] <amigojapan> I really have no idea
[18:24:45] <emmeka> it also suggests that it's way more common than people admit to
[18:25:47] <amigojapan> Yeah that sounds likely. Some people may be aroused by homosexual things but not act on it

[18:32:12] <amigojapan> Nanobot: like? Or are they streaming all day long?
[18:32:43] <amigojapan> emmeka: but your convictions may even be anti gay
[18:33:48] <emmeka> amigojapan if you're hungry but you're like "no, I'm not gonna get fat, I'm just gonna drink water!" this does not change the fact that you were hungry for food
[18:34:04] <Nanobot> amigojapan: I see Korone-Miko collabs at 2am, 3am, 4am, 5am, 6am, 8am, 10am, 12pm, 3pm, 4pm, 6pm, 7pm, 8pm, 9pm, 11pm, midnight, and 2am tomorrow.
[18:34:32] <amigojapan> Yeah emmeka but you can't jump to the conclusion that they are fat
[18:34:51] <Nanobot> Sounds like a 24-hour collab with lots of different segments.
[18:34:51] <emmeka> last I checked the definition of fat wasn't "person who wants to eat food"
[18:35:07] <amigojapan> Nanobot: I bet it is because of the new year
[18:35:57] <amigojapan> emmeka: I agree. But your definition for gay you put forward sounds similar to saying that
[18:36:55] <amigojapan> emmeka: also measuring arousal in women may be much more difficult which may account for the small number

[19:24:01] <Sapphirus> I'm basing it on Ontario's case count data 
[19:24:09] <emmeka> sure, but that's useless

[19:24:18] <emmeka> 90% of Ontario's adult population is vaccinated

[19:29:55] <emmeka> this actually suggests more than that

[19:31:25] <emmeka> I wonder what the cause of that could be. I mean, the science tells us that the vaccine offers at least some protection. So what is it? Are vaccinated people just engaging in riskier behaviour due to being able to go to restaurants and shit, while the unvaccinated persist in de facto lockdown?
[19:32:20] <amigojapan> emmeka: is that really the rule?
[19:32:25] <emmeka> here? yes.
[19:33:00] <emmeka> you need proof of vaccination to go to eat inside a restaurant or go to basically any public venue by law, and many more businesses just request it themselves
[19:33:21] <amigojapan> I see. In Japan we did not really get lockdowns. Only things like restaurants had to close at 8pm
[19:35:12] <emmeka> Sapphirus wait, what. I'm checking the data myself, I think they wrote it in backwards.
[19:35:24] <emmeka> the actual spreadsheets from the government of Ontario suggest the opposite

[19:35:55] <amigojapan> As expected from Reddit, unreliable
[19:36:50] <MootPoot> guys
[19:36:53] <MootPoot> I think we're fucked
[19:37:08] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: usually people can't be bothered to fact check like emmeka did
[19:37:23] <MootPoot> there is no new battery tech coming to save us
[19:37:23] <amigojapan> What's up MootPoot 
[19:37:24] <emmeka> Sapphirus no wait, nevermind. I'm just looking at October's data and reading the date wrong.
[19:37:28] <MootPoot> we're fuckered
[19:37:53] <emmeka> it does indeed show that for the last 2 weeks of 2021, the trend inverted, and case rates among the vaccinated vastly surpassed that of the unvaccinated
[19:38:47] <MootPoot> amigojapan: we're going to be stuck with li-ion forever
[19:39:05] <emmeka> but the data is weird. it shows similar rates among people with 1 dose as it does the unvaccinated, and that the fully vaccinated are doing worse. which makes no sense viewed from the vaccine as causation.
[19:39:21] <amigojapan> MootPoot: that's not guaranteed. But that is fine with me
[19:39:24] <MootPoot> my dream of having a smartphone which lasts as long as those old nokia bricks off charger is far gone
[19:40:15] <amigojapan> MootPoot: just needs a huge battery
[19:40:51] <MootPoot> even with a 10000 or 15000 mah battery it still wont make it a week
[19:41:04] <emmeka> Sapphirus but digging further it does suggest that hospitalizations are still hugely effected by vaccination. On the 31st, it says 89 ICU cases among the unvaccinated, 47 among the fully vaccinated, *not* adjusted for population. So that's like a 20 fold ICU rate.
[19:41:22] <amigojapan> MootPoot: 3 of them
[19:43:03] <MootPoot> lol amigo
[19:43:18] * MootPoot imagines carrying around a 1kg dumbell phone
[19:43:27] <amigojapan> MootPoot: 7 of them. One per day
[19:44:10] <emmeka> Sapphirus my guess is this: due to severe restrictions in the province on the unvaccinated and partially vaccinated, most of them are in de facto lockdown and not doing things which could get them infected. But the vaccinated are, because they're allowed to. So they're getting exposed more. Also, the vaccinated are now more often in situations where COVID testing is likely to happen to them, such as being at in-person workplaces.
[19:44:35] <emmeka> so I'd posit that it's a combination of more testing and more exposure that's doing it, rather than the fact that they're vaccinated.
[19:45:40] <emmeka> and that regardless, breakthrough infections are much much less likely to be serious than someone unvaccinated getting sick, the data on hospitalizations in the province supports this
[19:47:20] <amigojapan> emmeka: unfortunately it seems we got Omicron in Japan now even with strict restrictions on travel :(

[19:53:32] <emmeka> Sapphirus the specific date which the trend inverted on is December 22nd. That's sort of interesting. Prior to that, caseloads rose equally. Then, the infection rate among the partially vaccinated and the fully vaccinated surpassed the unvaccinated, then the fully vaccinated surpassed the partially vaccinated, and it kept going

[23:58:45] <HeTo> uhm, it's not as effective for growing muscle probably, but as I understand it fitness is more than just muscle size
