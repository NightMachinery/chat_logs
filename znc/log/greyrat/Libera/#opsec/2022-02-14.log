[01:02:04] <jan6> TIL about https://pluto.tv
[01:04:51] <CalimeroTeknik> hrm, that Bayesian thing is less convincing than I expected
[01:07:06] <jan6> it's better than nothing
[01:07:16] <jan6> but obviously pretty lousy to call it "truth serum"
[01:08:15] <jan6> since with that example, all it does is ask if you rate higher or lower than true answer, which wouldn't take into account the probability of just randomly guessing above or below
[01:11:56] <CalimeroTeknik> I'd say it caters to a mentality
[01:14:07] <CalimeroTeknik> jan6, here's my funny remark: I actually did not understand the "iscore" explanation besides some kind of prisoner dilemma thing
[01:14:37] <CalimeroTeknik> and perhaps in this my understanding is more unassuming
[01:16:38] <jan6> well, it's basically just that if you do the thing, you'll generally bias towards assuming more of other people do it also, than those who don't do the thing, and the thingy up front basically divides it into positive and negative scores....I think....
[01:16:56] <CalimeroTeknik> I did fall for this myself: if I don't recognize that people don't understand what I do, I can't rely on their answers within my own framework
[01:17:07] <jan6> I did fail maths tho, so never take my word for what it ACTUALLY means, lol
[01:17:52] <jan6> never assume jan6 tells the truth unless there's a source, for jan6 is prone to assumptions and derivations and such, while sounding as if they were factual
[01:18:31] <CalimeroTeknik> "trust me on this: do not trust me"

[01:24:01] <jan6> lol
[01:24:10] <jan6> atmosphere is thick
[01:25:59] <CalimeroTeknik> here's one thing I know: people have limited physiological resources, so there's a bound to how much processing they can do about a situation, and an incentive to do as little as will suffice
[01:27:16] <CalimeroTeknik> for those who come up with really great ideas all the time, since they put a lot of their resources for that, there aren't so many resources left for using these ideas efficiently and therefore extensively after that
[01:27:22] <jan6> if I proccessed everything to a level sufficient to most of everyone, it would take at least an hour for each sentence, lol
[01:28:49] <CalimeroTeknik> then again that depends on how you process them
[01:29:24] <jan6> well, for one, I don't even "think", lol
[01:30:00] <CalimeroTeknik> the most common approach in living organisms is to use approximation (formally speaking: PAC¹) and do little meta-cognition indeed
[01:30:11] <CalimeroTeknik> ¹ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning
[01:30:20] <jan6> approximation is of course the most efficient way to go about things
[01:30:30] <CalimeroTeknik> the most cost-effective
[01:30:38] <CalimeroTeknik> not the most efficient, no
[01:30:45] <jan6> well, yeah
[01:31:23] <jan6> you very rarely need actually accurate stuff, unless you're creating something that interacts with multiple things
[01:31:36] <CalimeroTeknik> it's efficient at certain reliability levels, in fact, and the threshold depends directly on the intricacy of the situation (how linear it is)
[01:32:36] <CalimeroTeknik> I find that it's interesting to have a strictly accurate bound, since that's not too hard to have
[01:32:37] <jan6> simple, the more ways to go wrong, the more effort you have to put in for it to not go wrong ;P
[01:32:47] <CalimeroTeknik> yes but no
[01:33:21] <CalimeroTeknik> the more the difference between right and wrong is intricate to figure out, the more effort is needed, strictly speaking
[01:33:24] <jan6> (assuming all the ways are equally likely, since y'know, TECHNICALLY there's pretty much uncountable ways for anything to go wrong)
[01:33:51] <jan6> that too, sure
[01:34:01] <CalimeroTeknik> but you can always have a bound at a constant cost, though it will be as far from the correct answer as that answer is intricate to reach
[01:34:26] * jan6 doesn't really get the "bound" idea from abstract talk
[01:35:03] <CalimeroTeknik> well, for example I could ask you how long it takes to go from two cities, and an easy bound is the speed of light
[01:35:28] <CalimeroTeknik> we already know you won't go faster than that between the two, no matter what
[01:35:42] <jan6> unless you do, with future-tech, or something
[01:36:15] <jan6> you can never know that it'll NEVER be possible to go faster than speed of light, only that as far as we CURRENTLY know, it is
[01:38:05] <CalimeroTeknik> you know, I'm a software engineer, and I've read about perfectly sensible models that allow for FTL travel, but my clients will need stuff that they know how to do today
[01:39:21] <CalimeroTeknik> and so do my travel plans
[01:39:52] <CalimeroTeknik> a technological solution always operates within a technological context, which is exactly what I'm doing
[01:39:55] <jan6> but is travelling at speed of light "sensible" for travel ? ;P
[01:40:28] <CalimeroTeknik> we are currently approximating it to some extent
[01:40:58] <jan6> I recently watched some video where one of the parts was that one scientist discovered a totally new kind of crystal structure, and he insisted he was right, but that meant he was asked to leave his working group, and nobody took him seriously, but eventually others also found it out, at one point they even tried to call it like sami-crystal, but eventually it was accepted that they had to expand
[01:40:59] <jan6> the definition of what a crystal *IS*, and he did eventually get recognition, and stuff, idk
[01:41:59] <CalimeroTeknik> yes, I'm twisting the definition of travel by suggesting maybe remote communication is a form of it
[01:42:15] <CalimeroTeknik> but remember: it was a bound
[01:42:34] <CalimeroTeknik> a pretty bad one at that
[01:43:01] <jan6> yeah, alright
[01:43:23] <CalimeroTeknik> basically illustrating that, at a constant cost, I can produce crappy bounds
[01:43:39] <CalimeroTeknik> with some form of technical correctness if the context is sufficiently defined

[01:46:06] <CalimeroTeknik> so my end point is, we can have technically correct bounds to do our uncertain speculation within
[01:46:57] <jan6> sure, but even then, they don't narrow things nowhere near enough
[01:47:03] <CalimeroTeknik> you can even try to do elaborate hint-seeking into what mechanisms could be at play, by first unleashing your guesses, and then seeing which are within the technically correct bound
[01:47:22] <CalimeroTeknik> "enough" → eye of the beholder
[01:47:35] <CalimeroTeknik> I'm often content with extremely approximate or dependent answers
[01:47:40] <jan6> sure, you can assume speeds are between 0 and lightspeed, but that's still an infinity of possibilities, as is the exact route, straight line from A to B? anything else? etc
[01:47:48] <CalimeroTeknik> (dependent = a constraint on any solution, but not even a partial answer)
[01:48:22] <CalimeroTeknik> bah, with a little more information we can easily refine that
[01:48:42] <CalimeroTeknik> let's say your budget is ¤300 and you leave right now
[01:49:15] <CalimeroTeknik> suddenly I'd say the bounds become 3 and 1000km/h
[01:49:44] <CalimeroTeknik> that's what commercially available for that budget
[01:49:48] <CalimeroTeknik> what's*
[01:50:17] <jan6> wow, literally first time I've actually seen anyone use ¤! kudos!
[01:50:50] <CalimeroTeknik> well, since almost the entire world uses a currency unit that means the same
[01:51:12] <CalimeroTeknik> except for China and Sweden where it's ×10 and Japan where it's ×100
[01:51:32] <CalimeroTeknik> just apply the correct power of 10 to your number of moneys
[01:51:36] <jan6> "means the same"?
[01:51:43] <jan6> x10/100?
[01:52:07] <CalimeroTeknik> 1€ = $1 = 10 swedish moneys = 100 japanese moneys
[01:52:23] <CalimeroTeknik> = 10 chinese moneys
[01:52:41] <jan6> well, currency exchanges are more complex than that
[01:53:19] <CalimeroTeknik> yes but that's a trap, don't fall for it
[01:54:40] <CalimeroTeknik> if I need anything more precise, I ask for the change rate right now
[01:55:19] <jan6> but how do you get the 1=1=10... sort of math, if you disregard currency rates? lol
[01:55:43] <CalimeroTeknik> if I'm for some reason in a Swedish airport on a connection and something says it costs 600, do you think that my $100 will afford it? the answer is yes
[01:56:18] <CalimeroTeknik> well you just have to look at the prices relative to the items, alternatively
[01:57:03] <CalimeroTeknik> see a thing for 60 currency units that you think costs $5? eh, this is a ×10 currency
[01:57:26] <jan6> heh, nice approximation stuff, I guess
[01:57:29] <CalimeroTeknik> because obviously 5×10 = 60
[01:59:46] <CalimeroTeknik> I actually came up to a currency exchange booth in an airport to ask "how much is the local currency worth? it's my first time with it" and they started giving me a very very precise rate, I said "one digit was enough, I'm new here"
[02:00:24] <CalimeroTeknik> or perhaps the guy at the booth started asking how much I wanted to convert to compute his rates (which of course included a commission)
[02:01:12] <CalimeroTeknik> anyway, I clarified very quickly that I had no idea if seeing a price tag of 500 meant a month's salary or small change
[02:04:02] <jan6> ^ which isn't that useful, imho, sure, it shows you the magnitude, but it doesn't even tell if you if it's a month's salary, because it's quite possible that income, and cost of living, are significantly different, also
[02:04:13] <jan6> but sure, whatever, still good for broad strokes
[02:05:14] <CalimeroTeknik> well, I'm illustrating how, with the same cost of thinking, I can get either a bound that's far away, or an approximation that's starting to look useful
[02:06:27] <CalimeroTeknik> in fact, doing both is less expensive than diving head first into shenanigans
[02:10:39] <jan6> kinda depends, but sure
[02:12:01] <CalimeroTeknik> on what does it depend?
[02:13:41] <CalimeroTeknik> I'm going to suggest a level where it doesn't depend: meta-cognition, thinking about how to think
[02:14:04] <jan6> for me, it's kinda useless, if I don't know it with any meaninful precision, e.g. I don't know if a candy costs 10 or 20¤, only "not terribly much, but not very cheap"
[02:14:13] <CalimeroTeknik> it's always useful to be able to tell if it's going to take an eternity of thinking to figure out something
[02:15:23] <CalimeroTeknik> hm well, it's still useful to have numbers kind of, because otherwise you're going to be comparing "a lot of" with "a fair bunch of" and "quite a bit"
[02:16:17] <CalimeroTeknik> which exposes you to a lot of biases that will make your thinking less efficient
[02:18:01] <jan6> which is still what you're doing with your method anyway
[02:18:08] *** Quits: Atque (~Atque@user/atque) (Quit: ...)
[02:18:58] <CalimeroTeknik> objection: strictly less so
[02:19:40] <CalimeroTeknik> your fallacy is: what's less precision when we're already doing an approximation?
[02:20:49] <CalimeroTeknik> you're kind of "in for a penny, in for a pound" there :)
[02:27:22] <jan6> well, I'd round and trunctate the number, and use it whole, not just the magnitude of it
[02:28:10] <jan6> that way I'd get both relatively simple math, and also can actually consider prices, instead of just "this is 10x more expensive"

[02:33:45] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[02:35:20] <CalimeroTeknik> but I can shift one decimal by using powers of 10
[02:35:43] <CalimeroTeknik> it's sufficiently cheaper that I'd rather do valid math with numbers… except those will be powers of 10
[02:36:13] <CalimeroTeknik> any more precise need and I'll use an actual currency conversion app
[02:36:47] <CalimeroTeknik> (though knowing myself, said app will be a calculator)
