[00:10:22] <blkshp> As in it follows the sequence that you expect so well that it might as well have been in the textbook
[00:10:38] <paul424> sure not, that's why I give tuition.
[00:10:46] <paul424> aha, maybe we have similar idiom in Polish.
[00:11:10] <blkshp> It's basically the same premise. 
[00:11:22] <blkshp> also, "sure not"?
[00:11:46] <paul424> what's wrong with "sure not"?
[00:12:00] <blkshp> It means "no I don't"
[00:12:17] <paul424> That's what I meant.
[00:12:30] * paul424 was ironic.
[00:12:43] <blkshp> and it's confused me completely.
[00:13:30] <paul424> Just because a movie is a monster hit doesn't mean it isn't interesting.
[00:13:40] <paul424> "monster hit" == "great hit"?
[00:14:17] <blkshp> I would say monster hit or hit, great hit is odd because you can't have a terrible hit.

[13:39:19] <Me-me> Either is valid.
[13:39:44] <Me-me> The differences in connotations are very, very, minute, if extant at all in your particular culture/subculture.
[13:39:59] <fentanyl> I see, I was told that (b) is used when the other person is a slave, like they underscored the the "some".

[13:40:13] <Me-me> May I ask who told you this?

[13:41:06] <fentanyl> (but another person, but i guess similar question)
[13:41:11] <Me-me> Let me say, emphatically, that I disagree wholeheartedly and with vehemence, the assertion made by Messir e2efour.
[13:41:29] <fentanyl> Ah, I see.
[13:42:38] <brigand> pussipupu: Due to technical limitations of display (standard fonts, browsers, etc.) and the fact that the sharp symbol (U+266F ♯ MUSIC SHARP SIGN (HTML &#9839; ·  &sharp;)) is not present on most keyboard layouts, the number sign (U+0023 # NUMBER SIGN (HTML &#35; ·  &num;)) was chosen to approximate the sharp symbol in the written name of the programming language.[39] This convention is reflected in the ECMA-334 C# Language Spe
[13:42:38] <brigand> cification.[15] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)#Name
[13:43:00] <Me-me> He appears to be insinuating an implication under nonexistent pretenses. For what cause, I have no clue. Perhaps he simply cannot bear the injurious experience of not having something "clever" to say, and he rationalised some association with "some" and ... what, personification? Pure drivel.
[13:43:11] <pussipupu> They should have chosen names that didn't have those issues
[13:43:27] <pussipupu> Especially as their own operating systems have such crap keyboard support
[13:43:43] <brigand> Heh.
[13:44:14] <Me-me> I mean it's a music pun. Computer science does things like that sometimes. I have a certain distaste for their cavalier attitude to language, at times.
[13:44:21] <Me-me> Which I believe I have ranted about in this room before.
[13:46:42] <pussipupu> I kinda like the pun, though logically it should place C♯ half way between C and D so it doesn't quite land
[13:46:43] <fentanyl> Which of these is correct? (a) Would you be willing to give it a review, or any remarks, if you have some free time? (b) Would you be willing to give it a review, or any remarks, when you have some free time? 
[13:46:51] <fentanyl> Is both "if" and "when" correct?
[13:46:58] <pussipupu> I just think most computer systems should have better keyboard support :þ
[13:47:03] <Me-me> They are both valid, however (b) sounds more natural.
[13:47:08] <fentanyl> alright.
[13:47:42] <pussipupu> I'd say (a) is less forceful, because it includes uncertainty in the receiver having any time
[13:47:50] <pussipupu> But not a lot in it
[13:48:07] <Me-me> I can see that.
[13:48:36] <fentanyl> Alright, I can use (a) then, since that's a request (to a busy senior person)
[13:49:08] <Me-me> I suppose if you wanted to read deeply into it, (a) is asking for action right now, but is leaving the possibility that there is no free time in which to do it, whereas (b) is asking the reader to get to it whenever they have the time, with the implied certainty that they will at that time.
[13:49:20] <Me-me> Lightly implied certainty.
[13:49:25] <Me-me> But again, both are valid.

[14:11:08] <paul424>  When Forrest, demonstrating the kind of benign whimsy that brings to mind Kurt Vonnegut's early fiction, decides that he feels like running across America for a couple of years, "Running on Empty," "It Keeps You Runnin'," "Go Your Own Way" and "On the Road Again" are all used for musical accompaniment. 
[14:14:45] <paul424>  If it's difficult to reconcile this sweet, guileless performance with the film's technical obsessiveness (a special satellite was used to track the sun's position and determine optimum lighting for the film's outdoor scenes), well, maybe it should be.
[14:15:00] <paul424> guileless performance , what kind of performance it is ? 
[14:15:28] <paul424> bad or good ? or what ? 
[14:18:16] <pussipupu> Honest, without deception (or seemingly so)
[14:18:29] <pussipupu> Deception or artifice I guess
[14:18:39] <paul424> aha I get it ...

[14:37:56] <Me-me> Don't worry about my freudian typo.
[14:38:06] <pussipupu> Because it should only ever mean “as written”?

[14:38:31] <Me-me> No. I refuse.
[14:38:32] <pussipupu> We really don't, we'll be fine
[14:38:38] <Me-me> There are no other words that mean what it means.

[14:38:59] <Me-me> It is necessary for many contexts. And useful.

[14:40:14] <Me-me> Wiktionary, and anyone else, can respectfully and figuratively kiss my ass with regards to "literally".
[14:40:34] <Me-me> I shall never waver. We need it to not be its own antonym, we need it to mean what it means.
[14:40:41] <Me-me> Because there are no substitutes.
[14:40:53] <blkshp> But autoantonyms are fun.
[14:41:38] <Me-me> There's nothing else we can say to communicate to someone that something is literally so.
[14:42:12] <brigand> Some might say "literally" means "letter by letter".
[14:42:13] <pussipupu> I like the term “Janus term” for autoantonyms
[14:42:23] <pussipupu> But I enjoy references to literature and mythology in general

[14:44:50] <pussipupu> In my defence I was looking out of the window at a pheasant
[14:44:53] <Me-me> Is the chance 100%?
[14:45:19] <pussipupu> It's extremely close to 100% at least, yes
[14:45:30] <brigand> https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/misuse-of-literally If this sense of literally is bothersome, you needn’t use it.  If you dislike hearing other people use it, you may continue to be  upset. If you would like to broaden your complaint slightly, and insist  that the original meaning of literal is the only proper one, go  right ahead (although, before committing to this, you should be aware  that this will restrict you to 
[14:45:30] <brigand> using literal when you mean “of, relating to, or expressed in letters”). 
[14:45:34] <Me-me> 100.05% but with some rounding errors.
[14:46:43] <Me-me> brigand: Thank you, I choose option 2 only. I don't care if it's the original definition, I care if it's the one useful one that isn't mirrored in any other word. It's a useful definition that I need access to, and that access is limited if it can be interpreted as the exact opposite.
[14:47:06] <Me-me> Other words can drift, I don't care. Let used to mean its opposite. There are more, as I'm sure we're all aware. But literally I shall defend to the last.

[21:08:23] <darsie> How many stories is cellar, ground, mezzanin, 1, 2, 3, roof floors?
[21:09:41] *** Quits: LuisM14 (~Luis@2607:fb90:4340:1b37:3c1b:e0ff:fec1:bd47) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:11:27] <TimMc> Just count them up, right?
[21:11:29] <darsie> With mezzanin(e) being a normal floor like the others.
[21:11:42] <darsie> 7?
[21:11:52] <darsie> A 7 story building?
[21:13:11] <blkshp> You need consistency. If you are going to say "story" in the American way, there's no ground floor. If you have a ground floor, it's storey
[21:14:50] <darsie> https://i.postimg.cc/wgcxTp7W/2021-12-14-184352-1680x1050-scrot.png
[21:14:55] <TimMc> darsie: Oh, well, that's different. :-)
[21:14:55] <blkshp> Also I think anything under the ground is not considered part of the "storey"
[21:15:40] <TimMc> A "ten-story building" is ten stories tall above the ground.
[21:15:50] <TimMc> regardless of underground levels
[21:16:10] <blkshp> That's what I thought.
[21:16:18] <blkshp> I'd call that 6 storeys
[21:16:25] <darsie> On the lower left there's a cellar window.
[21:16:36] <blkshp> that's underground
[21:17:20] <TimMc> 6 stories
[21:17:30] <TimMc> unless you're British
[21:17:31] <blkshp> We are in agreement
[21:17:40] <blkshp> Except for spelling of course
[21:17:42] <TimMc> yes :-)
[21:17:57] <blkshp> of course the one at the top is floor 5.
[21:18:05] <blkshp> or the 5th floor.
[21:18:10] * TimMc fires ze missiles
[21:18:26] * blkshp waits for them to drop out of range.
[21:19:29] <blkshp> Ok American, logic puzzle.
[21:19:54] <blkshp> So if the ground floor is the first floor, what is the 1st underground floor?
[21:20:11] <mdogg> Lower Level 1
[21:20:12] <mdogg> =P
[21:20:27] * darsie is back.
[21:20:30] <blkshp> That makes sense then.
[21:21:19] <mdogg> We have an underground garage at one of our buildings and the elevator can take you to the Lobby (ground floor) or to LL1 and LL2 if you parked in the underground parking.
[21:21:23] <blkshp> We would call it "-1" leading to Ground then +1. 
[21:21:38] <darsie> So, 6 US floors with the top (black) one being 5th?
[21:21:57] <blkshp> In the US the black one would be floor 6
[21:22:03] <blkshp> in the UK the black one would be floor 5
[21:22:08] <mdogg> darsie: In the U.K. they would say that the black floor on top is the 5th floor.  In the U.S., we would say that is the 6th floor.  
[21:22:12] <mdogg> blkshp is correct.
[21:22:27] <blkshp> s/is /is always /
[21:22:27] <chat> blkshp thinks mdogg meant to say: blkshp is always correct.
[21:22:32] <blkshp> xD
[21:22:34] <mdogg> lol
[21:22:37] <mdogg> My mistake.
[21:22:37] <darsie> Ground floor in US is 1, then, and what in UK?
[21:22:40] <mdogg> =p
[21:22:45] <blkshp> Ground
[21:22:47] <TimMc> floor zero :-P
[21:22:48] <darsie> ok
[21:23:05] <darsie> And cellar is cellar?
[21:23:22] <blkshp> The cellar or basement but those are not that common here.
[21:23:22] <mdogg> Correct.  Cellar or basement.  I think basement is more popular in the U.S.
[21:23:42] <blkshp> They're 2 different things 
[21:23:46] <mdogg> Are they?
[21:23:51] <blkshp> They are here.
[21:23:56] <blkshp> Well I think they are anyway.
[21:23:59] <blkshp> !d cellar
[21:24:01] <tinsoldier> cellar — Noun: 1. An enclosed underground space, often under a building, used for storage or shelter., 2. A wine collection, especially when stored in a cellar., 3. (slang) Last place in a league or competition., — Verb: 1. (transitive) To store in a cellar. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cellar
[21:24:06] <blkshp> !d basement
[21:24:08] <tinsoldier> basement — Noun: 1. A floor of a building below ground level.(geology) A mass of igneous or metamorphic rock forming the foundation over which a platform of sedimentary rocks is laid., 2. (sports, informal) Last place in a sports conference standings. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/basement
[21:24:33] <mdogg> Ah - I see.  The difference being that a basement is part of the foundation.
[21:24:38] <darsie> The US 2 floor is called Mezzanin here, to reduce the number of floors when houses were taxed by floor number.
[21:25:18] <darsie> In many old houses.
[21:25:33] <blkshp> We often don't have a floor 13
[21:25:49] <darsie> We, neither. Like this one ;).
[21:25:50] <blkshp> So anything over 13 floors you can't necessarily tell what the top floor is called.
[21:25:57] <mdogg> blkshp: Actually, that's the same here.  I do know of one hotel that has one but you're right.  A 13th floor is rare here.
[21:26:09] <blkshp> I live in a street where there's no house #13
[21:26:27] <pussipupu> But standard domestic staircases in England have 13 steps
[21:26:53] <blkshp> True true
[21:27:19] <darsie> Our long flight of stairs have 12 steps.

[21:30:07] <blkshp> Except also we'd never really say "Floor 4" we'd say "The fourth floor"

[21:36:26] <mdogg> If I ever get pushed out of a window from a very high floor, hopefully it will be in the U.K. so I don't have to pass as many floors before I hit the ground.

[21:37:03] <mdogg> lol
[21:37:54] <mdogg> Actually, that doesn't really work because if I count the floors I pass on my way down it will be the same in both places.
