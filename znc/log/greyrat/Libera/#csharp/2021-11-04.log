[00:08:39] <brianonymous_> win11 is starting to go that direction
[00:08:43] <bomb> I'm thinking a Macbook for the mom
[00:08:44] <khanred> Can you install CHromeOS on it?
[00:08:54] <jmer> I usually recommend refurbished business laptops

[00:09:19] <khanred> I just treat the Chromebooks as somewhat disposable

[00:11:55] <jmer> JakeSays: nothing prevents her from doing so... But still it seems odd to me that chromebooks wouldn't have centralized user management like Active Directory

[00:24:03] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: lol it's boxy but rugged as hell. all metal
[00:24:10] <brianonymous_> so it was a service locator use more than an injector
[00:24:26] <gufi_> o_O some one ... went through the trouble of including DI only to inject a factory that probably gets shit from the di framework?
[00:24:38] <brianonymous_> well, it is used in the controllers, but its not really a web app per se
[00:25:23] <brianonymous_> call it... web control
[00:25:56] <brianonymous_> and since it was there for the controllers, might as well use the service locator, right?
[00:26:22] <brianonymous_> this was a super long time ago, before service location was pooped on

[01:09:39] <JakeSays> i had one pulled. it didn't bother me much at all.
[01:09:49] <bomb> I know some acupuncture shit that works well. no needle needed
[01:09:53] <brianonymous_> toothpain is one of the worst things ive ever felt in life
[01:09:58] <brianonymous_> no, not one of. the one.
[01:10:12] <JakeSays> but i did get really fucked up on nox during the procedure.
[01:10:25] <jmer> JakeSays: it differs a lot... This was a big one... And there was parts of my jaw bone stuck between the tooth's roots
[01:10:28] <bomb> heh
[01:10:37] <brianonymous_> i had the same problem. impacted
[01:10:37] <JakeSays> jmer: ohh ouch
[01:10:49] <brianonymous_> i was on the floor in a fetal
[01:11:01] <JakeSays> i discovered i get real flirty on nox. lol
[01:11:03] <jmer> and one of the roots formed like an L shape and they where twisted so they had to twist it out l
[01:11:32] <jmer> I mean the procedure was painless because of local anaesthethic
[01:11:42] <jmer> but those two to three days afterwards...
[01:11:49] <brianonymous_> mine was before
[01:11:55] <JakeSays> yeah that does sound messed up
[01:11:58] <brianonymous_> apparently one of my roots started to bleed
[01:12:02] <brianonymous_> and built up pressure
[01:12:12] <jmer> brianonymous_: damn that sounds nasty
[01:12:17] <brianonymous_> worst pain of my life
[01:12:20] <jmer> I just had mine removed because it was inflamed
[01:12:40] <brianonymous_> i was in a hotel at the time too. i swear if i had access to pliers..
[01:12:59] <jmer> this was timed with me being able to take some days off from work
[01:13:04] <jmer> and the kids was at their dads place
[01:13:14] <jmer> so I just had peace and quiet the first couple of days
[01:14:01] <jmer> and I got the stitches removed yesterday... Which helped a lot with the pain
[01:14:50] <JakeSays> did the time change this past weekend?
[01:14:55] <brianonymous_> next?
[01:15:05] <JakeSays> hmm
[01:16:41] <jmer> DST changed last weekend JakeSays
[01:17:19] <brianonymous_> IT DID?
[01:17:22] <brianonymous_> oops, caps
[01:17:31] <jmer> yeah
[01:17:42] <jmer> and I'm certain, because my car is 1 hour ahead now xD
[01:17:55] <jmer> and... usually I get around changing it 14 days before it changes back
[01:17:56] <brianonymous_> my analog clocks are right tho
[01:18:26] <brianonymous_> my wife says no
[01:18:38] <jmer> well I don't know if you change the same time as us Danes
[01:18:44] <brianonymous_> oh, good point. lol
[01:18:51] <Suchiman> US changes DST at different time than europa
[01:18:56] <brianonymous_> you made me walk to my grandfather clock

[01:38:17] <Bilz> does anyone know how I can quickly and easily change all line endings in visual studio to LF from CRLF?
[01:38:22] <brianonymous_> yeah, a paper record with digital encoding
[01:38:32] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: isn't that basically SPDIF?
[01:38:49] <brianonymous_> i mean like printing encoded blocks on a roll of paper
[01:39:00] <JakeSays> player piano'ish
[01:39:02] <brianonymous_> and feeding that through either a camera or light sensor
[01:39:18] <brianonymous_> yeah, only digital.. but analog
[01:39:34] <JakeSays> extra points for use of toilet paper rolls
[01:39:57] <JakeSays> that sounds like it'd be fairly straight forward
[01:40:12] <brianonymous_> very much so.. i just wonder how much paper it would take for like 20 seconds of playback
[01:40:15] *** Quits: exvicesindaco (~exvicio@user/exvicesindaco) (Client Quit)
[01:40:27] <JakeSays> you could use a laser to burn tiny holes in the paper

[01:41:06] <brianonymous_> if i went raw 8bit wave, i could feed light sensors directly to a dac
[01:41:24] <brianonymous_> but... samplerates...
[01:41:58] <brianonymous_> 7khz samplerates gives me a 3khz bandwidth.. but thats 7000 block reads per second........
[01:42:10] <brianonymous_> that paper would be hauling ass
[01:42:17] <JakeSays> with the right paper i bet you could get huge densities
[01:42:31] <bomb> Bilz search & replace \n with \r\n?
[01:43:00] <JakeSays> brianonymous_: you could use E size paper rolls and reduce hauling assness
[01:43:16] <brianonymous_> ideally i print it on my laser printer ->
[01:43:22] <JakeSays> should've kept my e-size plotters
[01:43:24] <brianonymous_> thats why im temped to go low bandwidth AAC
[01:43:45] <JakeSays> bah. laser printer is boring. you need to BURN shit
[01:44:03] <brianonymous_> lol no, the interesting part is playing a digital signal from paper

[01:55:37] <bomb> I'd believe that when vast majority of nuget supports .net core everywhere

[02:08:20] <bomb> JakeSays I agree that Java is going more FP direction though
[02:08:26] <guideX> like say you have some urls "/news" for instance, and you have  a c# enum saying News = 12;
[02:08:40] <guideX> how do you sort of tell js what the number is in the enum
[02:09:15] <bomb> JakeSays Amber and Valhalla projects signal that. https://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/ https://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/
[02:09:40] <JakeSays> bomb: your computer science comment is really irrelevant. we're talking language syntax preferences.
[02:09:53] <guideX> I guess one way I can think of: /mysite/myfile.js isn't a js file really, it's a something in c# which generates a text file which happens to be js
[02:09:54] <bomb> guideX data-* attributes
[02:10:14] <Nasp> Generate it with OpenAPI
[02:10:22] <Nasp> Or generate it another way
[02:10:31] <guideX> openapi eh, or another api hmmm
[02:10:57] <guideX> I suppose I could just generate the actual js file from the global file or something
[02:10:58] <bomb> JakeSays but records aren't just syntax sugars to make classes look like C# properties, that's a different approach with immutability
[02:11:08] <guideX> upon site_load or whatever
[02:11:19] <guideX> is that a good idea?
[02:11:52] <guideX> if(!FileExists) GenerateTheJsFile(); something like that

[02:12:04] <guideX> oh hm
[02:12:22] <guideX> ok, it generates one file, and then something over moves it when it's not in use :D

[03:58:30] <bomb> Shariff I'd say, leave interfaces to API designers, and just use classes

[04:11:36] <Shariff> MizMahem: that makes sense. Thanks!
[04:12:04] <MizMahem> That is, an interfaces defines "all methods that implement this, must do this." While inheritance defines "all sub-classes are a kind of this base class."
[04:12:19] <MizMahem> Obviously often these two ideas go in hand, but sometimes they don't.

[04:14:45] <MizMahem> generally speaking you would prefer to rely upon the contract. "I want an object that can do this, I do not care about how it does it." Requiring a class is appropriate when "I want an object that does this *in specifically this way*."

[04:16:07] <MizMahem> To give a bad example, you cannot enforce how an `IList` implements its list. If you specifically want or need an `IList` that implements say a double linked list, then you could require a 'DoubleLinkedList` type instead.
[04:16:29] <Shariff> That makes sense
[04:16:57] <ike78> bomb: hummus with that!?
[04:17:06] <Shariff> I'm now trying to solve if I should use an interface or an abstract class.. I'm thinking an interface. But somehow my design is a mess...
[04:17:08] <MizMahem> but most of the time, you shouldn't care, and so should just require an IList. An in the same sense, most of the time you should provide an interface that defines the behavior of your classes.
[04:17:31] <brianonymous_> IEqualityComparer is a lovely built in example of why interface: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.iequalitycomparer-1?view=net-5.0
[04:17:32] <Shariff> Yeah, when what you, bomb and brianonymous_ have explained I was leaning that way

[04:21:45] <ike78> "get these things off me!!"
[04:21:51] <MizMahem> also when you get into IoC, usually an `interface`is how you specify the shape of the object you want to be provided, and provide.
[04:22:14] <Shariff> Would anyone be willing to have a look at: https://pasteboard.co/izMdt9ikUrzh.jpg . It is an image of my design. I'm trying to design a system, that will on one hand provide a library of my blu-ray collection (SKUs, need to be expanded on) and on the other hand see movie/tvshow information. But Sku should at some point contain either Movie, Tvshow, or both... Is this an ok approach, or am I gone off the deep end.. ?
[04:22:53] <Shariff> It gets even more complicated, because SKUs could also contain a few episodes, but not all of a season.. or a season, but not all seasons..

[04:28:00] <bomb> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj-Qez1kIUA
[04:28:31] <MizMahem> Shariff: the only thing I would say (and you appear to be doing this right) is to not necessarily get caught up thinking that if multiple objects have the same property they *must* be in the same inheritance hierarchy.
[04:28:34] <bomb> exciting, isn't it?

[04:28:59] <Shariff> I wasn't thinking that at all for the last day :P
[04:29:07] <ike78> pretty sure its not jungle
[04:29:15] <MizMahem> Like, both people and films have names, but that doesn't mean that they should both descend from a "HasAName" object or something.
[04:29:48] <bomb> jungle is the umbrella genre, contains all the DnB stuff and more
[04:30:01] <Shariff> Yeah
[04:30:16] <ike78> but yours is a totally differnt tempo - its awful infact!
[04:30:49] <ike78> sounds like its been dubbed in japanese!
[04:30:54] <MizMahem> or that even that the interface they implement should both derive from a parent "HasAName" implementation. I mean, you *could* do this, but you might just end up filling up your namespace with a lot of cruft that isn't very useful.
[04:31:20] <ike78> anyway, this is 2005
[04:31:27] <ike78> none of your 90's crap
[04:31:36] <ike78> they didnt have proper technos
[04:31:39] <Shariff> Yeah.. thanks for pointing that out! It made little sense when I tried that.. (to me)
[04:32:56] <ike78> bomb: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOm4Ec40UuM
[04:33:05] <MizMahem> In this, an inheritance is useful when two things are true. 1. Object B is "is a" type of Object A. Say both movies and tv are a... I dunno a film or something, like you have here, lol :p
[04:33:24] <jonp> "Media"
[04:33:32] <MizMahem> sure, Media.
[04:33:40] <ike78> by the 2010's it was barrely recognisable as drum and bass
[04:33:41] <MizMahem> 2. When Object A and Object B need to differ somehow in their logic, not just their values.
[04:34:10] <Shariff> I will definately keep that in mind
[04:34:20] <MizMahem> I don't know if that is true say for Film and TV role, but something to think about.
[04:34:34] <MizMahem> If there is no difference in logic, then there usually isn't any reason to have a different class.

[04:35:36] <ike78> can you hear the modem yet?
[04:36:18] <ike78> the rythm is like regaeton played backwards
[04:36:39] <MizMahem> anyways to come back to what you were originally asking, this looks a perfect place to use both techniques. Both a `TVShow` and a `Movie` could implement `IMedia` or whatever (as well as possibly their own`ITVShow` or `IMovie` interface or not), and they both might derive from an abstract base class of `MediaBase`or something.
[04:37:49] <Shariff> So you have the contract that defines what the classes should 'respond' to as well as a definition of they are of the same kind (to quote creationists) :D
[04:38:10] <MizMahem> but then your FilmCredit or whatever, just relies on the `IMedia` interface, so if say later you want to add, I dunno, books, or podcasts, or something to it, that has completely different logic that `MediaBase` you can do that.
[04:38:57] <MizMahem> maybe they would both derive from a `VisualMediaBase` in this case, I dunno.
[04:39:23] <Shariff> Interesting, I'll give that a go.. perhaps that also solves the sku problem :)
[04:39:32] <MizMahem> at this point you could completely refactor theh MediaBase without breaking anything
[04:39:33] <Shariff> Thanks a lot for your help and time!
[04:39:43] <ike78> by 2020 it literally was nologer recognisable, at all, as dnb https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKn9_ns8AIU
[04:39:49] <MizMahem> because from the outside, all anyone cares about is if they implement `IMedia` or not.

[16:04:05] <Assault> any Rider users here? I have hard time understanding why some values are shown as "does not exist in the current context" when debugging with breakpoints: https://snipboard.io/gwN51Q.jpg
[16:04:22] <Assault> even though they must exist, since I just defined them one line earlier
[16:04:38] <Diablo-D3> thats certainly interesting.
[16:04:48] <Diablo-D3> screenshot maybe?
[16:04:55] <Assault> Diablo-D3, me?
[16:04:57] <Diablo-D3> yeah
[16:05:11] <Assault> theres aleary a link to screenshot in my question
[16:05:19] <Diablo-D3> yes, and Im blind.
[16:06:05] <Diablo-D3> uh, its saying the variable you're _currently defining_ doesnt exist in this context?
[16:07:53] <irwiss> jbe: don't think you can call it 'best' in any category except blandness, but the drama generation out of it is off the charts
[16:08:15] <Diablo-D3> Assault: so Ill give you the standard intellij advice, I bet its the same issue
[16:08:24] <Diablo-D3> File -> Invalidate caches -> Invalidate and restart
[16:08:32] <bomb> JetBrains sucks and is overhyped
[16:08:38] <Assault> Diablo-D3, nopw..the execution is on line 78 and the variable "tex" is defined on line 76
[16:08:45] <jonp> bomb: but everything sucks and is overhyped…
[16:08:52] <Diablo-D3> bomb: intellij is fine, I'll agree rider is
[16:09:05] <bomb> jonp VS2008 was just great :(
[16:09:12] <irwiss> that looks like unity code, probs the unity debugger bridge is shitting the bed
[16:09:15] <Diablo-D3> ide to ide, intellij is better than vis studio, but specifically for c#, I'd never use rider.
[16:09:18] <jbe> irwiss: no, it's great the way I play it (reading about it)
[16:09:44] <jbe> it's almost as entertaining as star citizen (almost at 400 mill raised now)
[16:10:04] <Diablo-D3> Assault: Ive seen intellij do it, the same insanity, usually after I heavily mangled the code and its not realizing I broke shit
[16:10:38] <MatthiasVance> Day 3 of ISO27001/ISO9001
[16:10:38] <Assault> irwiss, yeah that is Unity code
[16:10:44] <bomb> Diablo-D3 IntelliJ is not a terrible product per se. but JetBrains marketing team is ruining by pushing Kotlin (eventually JetPack Compose too)
[16:10:48] <Assault> Diablo-D3, the cache invalidation thing didnt solve the issue
[16:10:49] <MatthiasVance> No fuckups as of now =)
[16:11:45] <Diablo-D3> Assault: oof.
[16:11:59] <Assault> ill try restarting both Unity and Rider...
[16:11:59] <irwiss> Assault: i'd check if the debugger bridge thing they got is up to date, think the rider one is also in the package manager
[16:12:00] <Diablo-D3> bomb: yeah, I dont like their marketing, although I like kotlin
[16:12:07] <Diablo-D3> but honestly, I dont fucking want to get into that goddamned war
[16:12:29] <Assault> the package "Jetbrains Rider Editor" is installed in my project, so its not that..
[16:12:31] <Diablo-D3> they're trying to position kotlin as the post-java-on-jvm, but java>8 is the post-java-on-jvm that the java committee is continuing with
[16:13:06] <Assault> also, SOME variables values ARE visible when debugging
[16:13:23] <Diablo-D3> like shit already went sideways, kotlin has records and defined what people expect the bytecode to look like to do records.... then java got records and implemented them wrong.
[16:13:37] <bomb> Diablo-D3 what
[16:13:47] <bomb> Java records are fine
[16:13:53] <irwiss> meh java still doesn't have autoproperties in almost-2022, so modern java only slightly less shit compared to old java
[16:13:55] <Diablo-D3> java records are not implemented like kotlin records.
[16:14:09] <bomb> Kotlin is just trying to be JVM C# with syntactic sugars
[16:14:20] <bomb> of course not, Java guys did a better job
[16:14:22] <Diablo-D3> bomb: in a lot of ways, yes.
[16:14:31] <Diablo-D3> the java guys did records worse, arguably
[16:14:43] <bomb> it's not complete yet, btw
[16:14:47] <bomb> give it a few years
[16:15:05] <bomb> it's more like a first step in the right direction
[16:15:11] <Diablo-D3> btw, java "has" autoproperties
[16:15:24] <Diablo-D3> its just via lombok, which seems to never get on the track of being merged into mainline =/
[16:15:25] <bomb> what's that? Lombok?
[16:16:12] <Diablo-D3> c# ended up being the better java in a lot of ways, so kotlin kinda... I dunno, I think they made a mistake getting in bed with android, but that might be the only way up and out
[16:16:19] <bomb> here is the thing. C# and Kotlin can afford crazy changes due to its adoption rate. Java is a conservative church, you can't just slap new syntax overnight
[16:16:42] <Diablo-D3> c# is versioned though
[16:16:46] <bomb> I don't think C# solved everything with properties and its (ugh) records
[16:16:55] <Diablo-D3> java "wasnt" until 9 shipped with "we can remove shit now"
[16:17:04] <bomb> their implementation needs patching on each release
[16:17:22] <Diablo-D3> so wait, c#'s records were impl wrong?
[16:17:47] <bomb> correct
[16:18:04] <Diablo-D3> wat.
[16:20:20] <bomb> look, I dislike Oracle as much as you do, and Java has a very bureaucratic and unfriendly track record, mostly due to enterprisey frameworks
[16:20:37] <bomb> but it's evolving really well in the last few years
[16:20:52] <Diablo-D3> oh no, dont get me wrong
[16:20:54] <Diablo-D3> Im glad its finally going
[16:21:07] <Diablo-D3> its just... I kind of no longer have a horse in the race
[16:21:15] <Diablo-D3> c# finally became good
[16:21:29] <Diablo-D3> like, over the past <5 years, it finally just became good
[16:21:44] <bomb> fair
[16:21:56] <Diablo-D3> Im still in #java even
[16:22:00] <irwiss> at the point where it gets any of the decent modern language features i'll be sipping gin and tonic decades in retirement

[16:22:50] <Diablo-D3> the moment they bite the hand that feeds them, yoink, its not theirs anymore.
[16:23:06] <bomb> all foss .net projects are funded by Microsoft, no?
[16:23:13] <irwiss> microsoft has tons of leverage as they control all money streams into .net
[16:23:37] <Diablo-D3> kind of yes, kind of no
[16:23:41] <bomb> we don't have large companies, universities, etc. revolving around JVM like it's Mecca
[16:23:49] <irwiss> but as long as they keep shitty managers from making dumb decisions, like that "lets revert hot reload" kind of dumbassery it'll be fine
[16:23:59] <Diablo-D3> if they intend to use the leverage, its dangerous to do stuff like maui or any sort of non-windows support

[16:28:48] <Assault> irwiss, u really think its the Unity <-> Rider bridge problem? because some values I can view while debugging, but some not

[16:37:05] <Assault> jonp, that doesnt seem to be the case: https://snipboard.io/KOLh2G.jpg
[16:37:10] <jonp> now, whether you want to use `new CultureInfo("it-IT")` instead of some other mechanism…
[16:37:23] <Assault> so as you can see, its value is printed to console, but rider claims its not in context

[16:37:50] <Diablo-D3> kotlin isnt going that route, though

[16:44:46] <Diablo-D3> I mean, they've rewritten half of intellij in it, so its prrrrrobably ready for adoption
[16:44:52] <bomb> now it's nothing but a niche hobbyist language. only Apache Spark is keeping it alive
[16:45:16] <Diablo-D3> functional programmers, largely, are idiots.

[16:55:33] <Assault> ah, i think i got why my vars "do not exist in current context". Its related to the fact that the method that they are in is async
[16:55:46] <Assault> i still dont really get WHY they are "out of context"..?
[16:55:55] <Diablo-D3> tf.
[16:56:47] <jonp> Assault: because that frame isn't executing anymore. async is weird.
[16:58:18] <Diablo-D3> jonp: but why the fuck is his ide bitching
[16:58:53] <Assault> jonp, eh...but breakpoint should halt the execution, right? and if I just defined the variable, it kinda must be  "in context"?
[17:02:03] <canton7> Assault, remember that async methods are turned into state machines, and stuff that stays alive across awaits needs to be stored in fields on that state machine
[17:02:36] *** Joins: Roughy (~mdaw45ns@user/roughy)
[17:02:38] <Assault> canton7, ok..well async stuff is quite new to me, so i didnt know that
[17:03:06] <canton7> Assault, it's very similar to how generator methods (ones which use 'yield') work as well, if you're familiar with those
[17:03:28] <Assault> canton7, still dont understand if I define int foo = 3; and then halt the execution on the next line with a breakpoint, the foo is out of context...why?
[17:04:06] <canton7> Assault, you're definitely building for Debug, not Release?
[17:04:20] <Assault> canton7, yes
[17:04:41] <canton7> Can you post actual code / a screenshot?
[17:04:49] <Assault> this is a Unity project, not sure how to even build for release
[17:04:55] <Assault> hold on, a screenshot coming up..
[17:05:35] <canton7> 'In the Build Settings dialog there is a check box called "Development Build".', appparently

[17:07:29] <Diablo-D3> its how they fucking use the swap chain to maintain consistent latency

[17:07:43] <Assault> canton7, https://snipboard.io/hY8yj1.jpg
[17:07:46] <Diablo-D3> UE4 has a worse "this is UE" feel than UE3
[17:07:58] <_Shurik_> perhaps, but it just got annoying
[17:08:01] <Diablo-D3> UE4 and Unity are neck and neck for worst generic 3D engine
[17:08:12] <Diablo-D3> its *really* fucking hard to be unique in either
[17:08:15] <_Shurik_> what else is out there?
[17:08:21] <canton7> Assault, is 'Development Build' checked in the Build Settings dialog?
[17:08:28] <Diablo-D3> _Shurik_: write your own.
[17:08:33] <_Shurik_> hehe
[17:08:34] <Nasp> SKull:  This was just their unity demo project
[17:08:38] <Nasp> And it was baaaad
[17:08:39] <Diablo-D3> I dont care how hard it is, I infinitely respect people who do that.
[17:10:20] <Assault> canton7, yeah there is the "developent build" checkmark in the build settings. It was not checked, but I checked it and still the issue persists. I would guess that checkbox has only effect when actually building the unity project, which is not what im doing here. Im debugging in the editor (attaching Rider to Unity editor and pressing play in unity)
[17:10:54] <canton7> I'm not familiar with Unity, so I don't know whether it will be building as Debug or Release
[17:11:05] <canton7> Apparently 'Debug.isDebugBuild' is a thing as well
[17:11:46] <canton7> But either way, if it is release, don't expect locals to exist

[18:31:43] <SKull> i haven't been this nervous in months, jesus
[18:31:57] <SKull> the interview ended fine on 1%, phew!
[18:32:57] <irwiss> may be powerbank is a worthwhile investment if you can reach sub-20% battery
[18:33:28] <SKull> irwiss: it was plugged in! it's just that teams used more electricity than the battery was loading
[18:33:56] <Suchiman> SKull: adrenaline junky
[18:34:34] <SKull> Suchiman: yeah, my first fault was to think i could use my boyfriend's mac for the interview. but since macs are pieces of crap, that didn't work
[18:35:04] <SKull> also,  my boyfriend apparently has a different root pw than his user pw, and he thought it was the same
[18:35:07] <SKull> typical mac user ^^
[18:35:26] <SKull> i expected teams to run in the browser on that thing, it didn't
[18:35:57] <SKull> that's what i get for relying on mac users and or macs :D
[18:36:11] * SKull probably doesn't get the job anyhow so whatever
[18:36:30] <irwiss> super slow charger? don't think my phone can even eat more than 18W at full load
[18:37:02] <SKull> irwiss: i've yet to find the fast chargers. i have so many that accumulated over the years
[18:37:11] * Suchiman has a oneplus with warp charge so... charges insanely fast

[18:39:24] <SKull> also, the recruiter that hooked me up failed to copy paste their actual job description.
[18:39:26] <Suchiman> my oneplus charges like 1.5% a minute
[18:39:40] <irwiss> if your phone does USB PD you can also charge your laptop, cost me like $30 to get a charger that can charge both my phone and laptop at 60W, it's also tiny af compared to laptop "stock" charger
[18:39:53] <irwiss> i mean, phone charges at 18W, but same charger/cable
[18:40:02] <SKull> the fact that the recruiter looks like donald trump jr should've been a warning to me

[18:42:58] <jmer> SKull: how did they book you for an interview then?

[18:43:10] <irwiss> yeah HR firms are to blame for like 80% of making "getting a job" experience miserable af
[18:44:07] <irwiss> with other 20% are companies who want senior engineer for the salary of a janitor and schedule of mcburger flippers
[18:44:22] <SKull> irwiss: there are many serious and good HR firms out there, but there are also a loooooooot of awful ones that just scan jobs.ch and XING and email blast everyone

[18:46:04] <Nasp> I dont need one, but my One plus takes terrible pictures
[18:46:07] <Nasp> And it's toooo big
[18:46:42] <Nasp> Suchiman:  Min'es the 7 Pro so about the same i take it
[18:46:45] <irwiss> all phones are shit at taking pictures, get entry level dslr and a good lens + external flash and you're set
[18:47:09] <Suchiman> my biggest complaint with OnePlus is that they Samsung'ified the UI with Android 11 so i have skipped that upgrade yet
[18:47:16] <MizMahem> I've yet to find a dslr that will fit in my pocket though.
[18:47:18] <biberu> the best camera is the one you carry with you
[18:47:26] <Nasp> Suchiman:  A bit but not as much as samsung
[18:47:27] <MizMahem> maybe I need bigger pockets.
[18:47:30] <Nasp> But yeah i prefer a bit more stock feel
[18:47:41] <Nasp> irwiss:  Some are better than others
[18:47:47] <Nasp> Like my old samsung took insane photos
[18:47:47] <irwiss> a phone that can do dslr quality pictures won't fit in a pocket either, there's only so much you can get with 4mm focal length
[18:47:47] <MizMahem> "Miz, is that a DSLR in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?"
[18:47:53] <Nasp> This oneplus is just garbage

[18:48:37] <Nasp> I wonder of any of those foldable phones will ever be usable
[18:48:44] <Nasp> Am i the only one who want a smaller phone?
[18:48:50] <Suchiman> yeah
[18:48:58] <Nasp> It seems like they take the current big phones and make them foldable, so you have an even bigger phone / tablet
[18:49:07] <Nasp> Would prefer just having a normal 4 years ago phone
[18:49:07] <Suchiman> could be a bit shorter
[18:49:11] <Nasp> And thne being able to lfold it out
[18:49:16] <Nasp> Yeah it's the height that's the problem
[18:49:38] <Nasp> Also i want bezels back

[19:54:04] <MizMahem> I'm usually pretty chill on Government issues, but the spam call ones makes me ABSOLUTELY FUCKING FURIOUS.
[19:55:45] <MizMahem> For you and me, the spam calls are just an aggravating annoyance, but the way they prey on the elderly starting to suffer from dementia makes me livid.
[19:56:45] <MizMahem> And it is a 110% technically solvable problem. Providers know who is making these calls. They are routing the traffic, they know who it is coming from, they just can't be assed to care. They'll sell access to their network to any fly-by-night middle man, and give no shits at all about what kind of customers they bring on board.
[19:57:00] <MizMahem> They think this makes their hands clean. They would rather sell us "spam blocking solutions."
[19:57:02] <MizMahem> FUCK THAT.
[19:57:34] <MizMahem> WE HAVE THE MEN WITH THE GUNS. WE HAVE THE PREDATOR DRONES. WE HAVE TANKS AND NUKES. WE CAN MAKE THE FUCKERS CARE.
[19:58:35] <MizMahem> "If you are going to operate a telecom network, you have to perform due diligence on who you are providing phone transit for." Not that hard of a law to write.
[19:59:04] <MizMahem> "Oh, you are reselling to some middle man? Well they better be performing that diligence as well, or it's your ass on the line, company."
[19:59:24] <MizMahem> Know Your Customer laws have been a thing in banking for a long time.
[20:01:35] <DevJohnC> it is a hard law to write because you have to be sure it won't be abused or misappropriated
[20:01:52] <jonp> and you have to assume that EVERYTHING will be abused and misappropriated
[20:02:02] <jonp> and 2nd order effects are A Thing™
[20:02:50] <MizMahem> Good thing we have a professional class dedicated to writing such laws.
[20:02:55] <jonp> lol
[20:02:58] * redoc hands MizMahem a joint
[20:03:03] <jonp> yes, we do, but they're not necessarily *good* at it
[20:03:10] <MizMahem> Sorry, it just makes me so mad when I hear that "there is nothing we can do about this." FUCK THAT.
[20:03:24] <jonp> there is absolutely something we can do
[20:03:37] <jonp> the Q is whether that "something" is *worse* than the current status-quo
[20:03:48] <MizMahem> The problem is REALLY FUCKING SIMPLE. You are selling transit to these shady scam companies. Or are you are letting your resellers sell transit to these shady scam companies.
[20:03:51] <jonp> and failing to even *consider* that possibility is not a good thing
[20:03:52] <MizMahem> DON'T FUCKING DO THAT.
[20:04:05] <redoc> Make Lobbyists Illegal.
[20:04:11] <jonp> lol
[20:04:16] <jonp> lobbying is free speach
[20:04:35] <redoc> it's legal bribery
[20:04:54] <jonp> except it isn't; SCOTUS decreed that "bribery" is *really* limited in scope

[20:07:19] <MizMahem> But I'm mad, and don't even give a fuck. A bet you if I wrote a law that said "Hey, if my fucking grandma gets a call that says its from the IRS, *and that call is not from the fucking IRS*, then the person who is making her pay to receive that call gets their ass slapped with a big ass fine." Then I think the telecom companies would figure this shit out *real quick.*
[20:07:36] <interop_madness> "according to the US Code, there needs to be an exact dollar figure for the exchange of services, that would not hold up in a court of law" *smiles smug jordan belfort smile*
[20:07:43] <MizMahem> But fine, fine, they have their lobbyist, and they want to write some more even handed "KYC" type regulations. Fine.
[20:07:50] <MizMahem> JUST FUCKING DO IT ALREADY.
[20:07:59] <redoc> MizMahem: i agree
[20:08:01] <jonp> anyway, there is progress in that area
[20:08:09] <MizMahem> I know there, is and that's good.
[20:08:16] <MizMahem> I'm still fucking mad as hell it has taken so long.
[20:09:01] <DevJohnC> the progress is that nobody answers their phones any more
[20:09:13] <redoc> ^
[20:09:28] <MizMahem> It's fucking shameful that the telcom companies turned a blind eye to this for so long and let the problem get so big.
[20:09:33] <jonp> i think i'm the only one in my household to actually answer the phone
[20:09:35] <DevJohnC> which, as an anxious introvert, I appreciate
[20:09:55] <MizMahem> I'd fucking fine them an asston for their negligence anyways.
[20:10:14] <MizMahem> Arguably they owe all their customers a duty to not let fucking fake ass scam calls go to my Grandma.
[20:10:29] <MizMahem> since they are the ones selling those scammers access to fucking do it.
[20:10:35] <MizMahem> (either directly or through middle men)
[20:13:46] <DevJohnC> nothing like being handed an objc++ library and being asked to "compile it for M1 please" and lo and behold the project format is from XCode 3.2
[20:14:01] <jonp> 3.2?!
[20:14:02] <jonp> wow
[20:14:11] <DevJohnC> for the record, we're up to XCode 13.1 now
[20:14:16] <DevJohnC> yeah
[20:14:53] <DevJohnC> I'm a little lost for how to add the Intel and Apple Silicon build target to this, lol
[20:15:18] <jonp> "something something" click a checkbox somewhere?
[20:15:57] <DevJohnC> it's XCode, managing these types of settings doesn't make ANY sense to me and that's before you account for differences in how to target from ye olde XCode 3.2 to today
