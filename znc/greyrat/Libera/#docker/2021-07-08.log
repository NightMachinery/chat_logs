[00:26:29] <ignorand> tabakhase, my editing of files in the host does not trigger a reload on my 'yarn serve'. And I'm running on docker from CMD (I skipped the whole WSL part)

[00:32:18] <tabakhase> usually things have a switch to change the method, or ive even seen whole client/server splits :D
[00:32:54] <tabakhase> react has some CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING, vue-js has watchOptions: poll: true...

[00:39:53] <ignorand> tabakhase, on osx I could just yarn serve (without docker) and it would hot-reload or so. I'll google it up. just needed to rant :P

[00:45:59] <programmerq> mac docker desktop has a filesharing thing built in that forwards filesystem events for hot reloaders that use inotify. docker desktop on windows uses whatever shared folder thing that hyperv uses, which doesn't have that support.
[00:47:59] <tabakhase> ignorand ye mac is bit of a false positive there - its bind mounts are supposedly more volumes than mounts ((thats why performance is bad and you may even have to "pick a direction" to get reasonable speed out of it)) - dont rly know about the inner workings of it, so take with grain of salt :D
[00:48:38] <tabakhase> (:cached or :delegated stuffs)
[00:49:57] <ignorand> tabakhase, well, I can't afford a mac anymore. So I'm back on a pc with windows. Just getting used to all non *nix things

[01:17:04] <tabakhase> slinging around yarn_cache sounds like a bloddy mess :D - if one were to do that, i guess one could abuse multistage for this... often also not worth caching if your order is correctly... for the few times a month/week those change... and the "rightest" these days would prob. be buildX what can mount things during build just like run can

[18:40:04] <Shariff> Hi there
[18:40:52] <Shariff> Is there a command like docker-compose down that destroys a container completely, and with up rebuilds it like a fresh install, rather than retain the old data?
[18:41:15] <wez> hi Shariff 
[18:41:20] <Shariff> Hey Wez!
[18:41:52] <wez> ummmm, delete the containers too?
[18:42:10] <Shariff> Yep
[18:42:14] <BtbN> Don't re-exec the same container, really
[18:42:16] <BtbN> just run a new one
[18:42:28] <Shariff> docker-compose down does the trick, only it retains the volumes
[18:42:41] <Shariff> So run docker-compose a 2nd time while the other one is still up?
[18:42:45] <BtbN> docker-compose just calls docker for you, it does not do any internal magic
[18:43:07] <Shariff> ok..
[18:44:21] <Shariff> Thanks 
[18:51:18] <programmerq> 'docker-compose down' will delete volumes too. if you have a bind mount, then docker/docker-compose won't delete anything on the host at that location.
[18:53:55] <Shariff> Oh duh.. of course.. and in this instance I made use of bind mounts.. 
[18:54:02] <Shariff> programmerq: thanks!

[20:47:50] <mbuf> If I run "sudo docker run --rm -it --cpuset-cpus="10-13" jess/stress --cpu 4" twice, docker still honours the request and runs eight stress apps. Why? Shouldn't the second invocate say that the CPUS are already utilized, and not available?
[20:48:01] <mbuf> How to get exclusive CPU access with Docker?
[20:50:58] <programmerq> that just says "this particular cgroup should only run on cpu 10-13", it doesn't mark those cores as exclusive access to only that cgroup. docker is just a fancy way to run processes using linux namespaces and cgroups. Linux's CPU scheduler still decides what gets cpu time where.
[20:52:02] <programmerq> and the linux cpu scheduler, as far as I know, doesn't have a way to achieve what you're talking about. maybe some sort of custom scheduler could do that? but that's probably pretty complicated.

[21:17:44] <programmerq> that does not show that the host's port 25 is mapped to the container's port 25. it just shows that port 25 is "exposed" which is really just metadata-- not a publish. Additionally, the host's port 49154 is mapped to the container's 1525

[22:36:05] <aab_> don't know why you using bit warden you are making yourself more work.
[22:36:22] <devslash> because I want to self host my passwordmanager
[22:36:43] <aab_> lol
[22:36:54] <aab_> vaultwarden is self hosting it, it is bitwarden
[22:38:14] <devslash> when you build Bitwarden it uses an env file and it has some secret key values defined there
[22:38:43] <aab_> you could do it that way then
[22:38:49] <aab_> there is also another way
[22:38:49] <aab_> https://bitwarden.com/help/article/install-on-premise/#configure-your-environment
[22:38:55] <aab_> adminSettings__admins=
[22:39:16] <devslash> globalSettings__internalIdentityKey, globalSettings__internalIdentityKey, globalSettings__oidcIdentityClientKey and globalSettings__duo__aKey
[22:39:38] <devslash> oh yea I have that as an exmpty key
[22:39:42] <devslash> empty
[22:39:43] <aab_> well then
[22:39:46] <aab_> it can't be empty
[22:39:54] <devslash> so what do I put in there
[22:39:55] <aab_> it needs a key like the one I showed you in my settings
[22:40:00] <aab_> the secret key lol
[22:40:08] <devslash> no
[22:40:11] <devslash> I mean,
[22:40:16] <devslash> do I create my own secret key
[22:40:32] <aab_> yeh but has to be the same amount of characters
[22:40:43] <devslash> how many characters is that
[22:40:47] <aab_> I have no idea
[22:40:55] <aab_> I just changed a few and saved the key
[22:41:28] <aab_> it's much easier via gui

[22:47:26] <devslash> according to that page, the key adminSettings__admins= should be a list of email addresses not a secret key

[23:07:32] <devslash> aab_, I got into the admin portal
[23:08:23] <devslash> it shows a warning with an exclamation point next to the server version and web version
[23:09:06] <devslash> but other then that, the admin is very limited. It only lets you view users and organizations

[23:11:50] <aab_> no it doesn't it lets you test and configure smtp settings
[23:11:55] <aab_> and other settings required
[23:12:13] <aab_> unless you start providing screenshots I have no idea what you mean most of the time
[23:15:09] <devslash> I just meant that the images that I was using were slightly out of date but I am updating them now

[23:19:33] <devslash> and that when you go into the admin for bitwarden it tells you whether you have the latest server and web image installed, lets you view and search users and view and search organizations but doesnt let you do anything else
