[01:48:45] <jfh> would it be accurate to say that BOTH-CASE-P is meant to determine if a character is from an alphabet that supports upper and lower case? so things like numbers and arrows would be NIL, also something like a Japanese kana would be NIL ... but I get the feeling that might not have been the intended niche for BOTH-CASE-P to fill ... anyone have any more context on BOTH-CASE-P?

[01:50:36] <kagevf> (repeating question because I asked under the wrong nick) would it be accurate to say that BOTH-CASE-P is meant to determine if a character is from an alphabet that supports upper and lower case? so things like numbers and arrows would be NIL, also something like a Japanese kana would be NIL ... but I get the feeling that might not have been the intended niche for BOTH-CASE-P to fill ... anyone have any 
[01:50:42] <kagevf> more context on BOTH-CASE-P?
[01:53:37] <Bike> there are also characters like numbers and punctuation, not from alphabets, that don't have case
[02:00:02] <kagevf> so was the intent basically to be able to identify those?
[02:09:20] <Bike> i assume the intent was to identify either kind of un cased character
[02:10:18] <Bike> i imagine the standardizers were aware that languages without case exist, since there was already a community of lispers in japan
[02:12:09] <edgar-rft> there are also alphabetical characters with only one case, german "ÃŸ" for example
[02:13:32] <Bike> the lisp case operations are too simple to handle the real chaos of language, probably
[02:18:02] <edgar-rft> alphabetical sorting order is another thing that is heavily locale-dependent

[03:32:58] <kagevf> edgar-rft: a-ha! I was wondering if there was something like that ... I could imagine something like that was in mind as a use case for BOTH-CASE-P
[03:35:20] <kagevf> Bike: what you said makes sense; I guess the naming seems kind of random to me, so was wondering if there was some use case that would make it click ... not sure what I would suggest to improve the name, though, haha ...

[14:11:06] <lisp123> I used to know this, but remind me again what ,', does in Macros?
[14:11:36] <lisp123> I think the right hand , evaluates the symbol to what is passed in
[14:11:51] <lisp123> the ' prevents the symbol itself being evaluated (just "found")
[14:12:29] <lisp123> and then the left hand , is used to turn on evaluation within an outer ` (usually in macros that define other macros)
