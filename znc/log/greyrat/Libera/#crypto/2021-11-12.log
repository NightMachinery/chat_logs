[09:24:19] <taeaad> iz: Yes, that I think is an inherent issue. There should be a (possibly rigorous) tradeoff between statistical explanation power and obfuscation of data. You could for example do homomorphic operations and output say f(x) = mean(x). In some contexts mean(x) may be exactly the important structure of the data and thus "give away" what you tried to keep encrypted. I think the idea needs to still have human intervention as custodians of
[09:24:19] <taeaad> data, but if you do fraud analysis between multiple banks I think the idea is that you still have normal data security, but HE allows data analysts to have a higher clearance level.
[09:29:47] <taeaad> The other problem is that I think machine learning could unwork or work against the HE principles; also, people are terrible at judging security. Prime numbers have been studied for millenia and that is more or less why we know factorisation is slow and thus secure. But with Shor's algorithm, or perhaps other new technology, it doesn't stay secure indefinitely. HE of course has that same issue (newer technology could decrypt it) with
[09:29:48] <taeaad> the added problem of data analysist doing statistics on plaintext via a homomorphic property f(x.y) = f(x).f(y). The property itself doesn't need to reduce security (FHE) but the statistics surely need to be "correct" and "about" the plaintext. In other words, you are exactly doing what encryption tries to avoid, which is extracting facts and properties of the plaintext.

[16:02:20] *** forza4 is now known as doseo
[16:02:26] <iz> er, encrypt(0, k2)
[16:03:13] <iz> er.. i mean c1 * c2 * c4 = c5 where decrypt(c5, k2) == 0
[16:04:02] <br1ck> iz, you want to check IF m1*m2*m4 == 0 knowing c1,c2,c5
[16:04:12] <iz> but it still sorta feels like from that, you could figure out some things about m1, m2, or m4 based on c5 always being the same in certain instances
[16:04:29] <iz> oh yeah, i see what you mean now, yeah
[16:04:56] <br1ck> and probably some k2 that allows you the computation

[19:19:08] <Gallomimia> also ##altcoins is not a channel.
[19:19:15] <MacGyver> It used to be.
[19:19:37] <MacGyver> If you find where they moved I'd be happy to update the topic to point there.
[19:19:37] <Gallomimia> i didn't say it never used to be. it's just vacant now
[19:19:44] <Gallomimia> yeah trying
[19:19:54] <Gallomimia> maybe if i find a log for this client
[19:20:06] <MacGyver> I imagine there's a non-zero chance they stuck with freenode.

[19:21:04] <MacGyver> To the point where most people decided to trust the operators they *knew*, rather than the unknown entity that until that point had not meddled.
[19:21:36] <MacGyver> For the long story long, a quick google and half an hour reading should get you up to speed.

[23:06:21] <Alipha> or maybe q/j

[23:06:45] <riv> so smart

[23:07:34] <Alipha> riv: it's probably a bad idea to scramble the cube randomly, because then the recipient has to figure out how to get the cube into that same initial state, heh
[23:07:55] <Alipha> riv: you should start with a "solved" rubik's cube and then use a passphrase to seed

[23:08:17] <Alipha> or do that, sure
[23:09:57] <riv> oh wait, encryption scrambles the cube more

[23:12:21] <Alipha> so encryption and decryption have the same initial state
[23:12:32] <riv>  wow!
[23:13:20] <Alipha> it's just a matter that for encrypting, you're going X -> N -> G -> (rotate), and for decryptiong, you're going (rotate) -> G -> N -> X
[23:13:57] <riv> I should try this out :D
[23:14:06] <riv> its really elegant

[23:14:48] <Alipha> if you're familiar with Card Chameleon, you're definitely see the similarities
[23:14:51] <riv> I guess the reason for doing the turns while encrypting is to stop the output being predictable (i.e. same letter encrypting to same letter)

[23:28:37] <ms7821> absolutely not
