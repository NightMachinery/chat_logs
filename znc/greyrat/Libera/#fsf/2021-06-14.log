[02:29:10] <AppleGNU> A lot of this comes down to pieces of software claiming systemd as a dependency, when not an actual essential piece. Devuan proved that with the systemd-shim package.

[06:24:09] <jxself> Firefox itself also has freedom problems, like how you can't share a version once a new one comes out.
[06:24:23] <dragestil> I guess there's no free addon repo except https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Collection:IceCat_plugins
[06:24:27] <jxself> Perhaps best avoided until/unless Mozilla addresses those various things.
[06:25:58] <dragestil> jxself: I suppose you are referring to the trademark policy

[06:28:37] <darwin> are FSF associate member cloaks available yet?
[06:28:40] <dragestil> given all this is under trademark policy, my understanding is if you don't use the firefox name you are not bound to these restrictions in distribution
[06:29:01] <yrk> it is an example of the nyquist theorem of licensing: "you must be twice as smart as the most complicated unanticipated consequence of your well meant licensing decision to write a license"
[06:30:25] <jxself> dragestil: Sure but when invoking Freedom #2 you're making exact copies.
[06:30:48] <dragestil> yrk: how so? do you think the mozilla practice can be fixed with a better license?
[06:31:16] <dragestil> i.e. there can be a free software license banning the mozilla practice
[06:31:18] <jxself> It would seem to mean that freedom #2 expires when a new version comes out.
[06:31:38] <jxself> That makes me think of the part of the Free Software Definition that "In order for these freedoms to be real, they must be permanent and irrevocable as long as you do nothing wrong; if the developer of the software has the power to revoke the license, or retroactively add restrictions to its terms, without your doing anything wrong to give cause, the software is not free."

[06:34:26] <jxself> Why not recommend Firefox?

[06:36:43] <dragestil> This is a "hidden" big statement that many people would not notice
[06:36:53] <jxself> Yes because in addition to "when distributing you must distribute the most recent version of Firefox and other Mozilla software" they also say: "you may not charge for the software"

[06:39:36] <dragestil> jxself: you are right
[06:39:46] <yrk> support for drm, for instance
[06:40:12] <dragestil> another thing is it is not trivial to remove google from the search engine list in firefox

[06:43:42] <rio6> does the the ability for firefox to run non-free javascript make firefox non-free
[06:43:51] <yrk> rio6: no
[06:44:20] <yrk> rio6: my trisquel system is a fully-free gnu/linux distribution, and it doesn't stop me from running non-free software

[06:51:02] <dragestil> Another problem with firefox is that it is also bundled with pocket client, but the pocket server code is still proprietary

[07:15:33] <jxself> That is totally fine to rename a program.
[07:16:01] <jxself> This possibility is even mentioned in the Free Software Defintion.

[07:28:20] <yrk> "some licenses"? that is very vague
[07:28:20] <jxself> Stemming from the earlier Firefox discussion about the trademark.
[07:28:32] <yrk> "I found some bugs in some software"
[07:28:46] <aggi_> it is the combination of license terms: the copyright notice MUST be included, yet the names/trademark (depends on interpretation) must not be mentioned without permission
[07:29:04] <jxself> When promopted aggi_ specifically pointed to the BSD licenses.
[07:29:18] <yrk> aggi_: gplv3 also allows declining trademark rights in section 7(e)

[07:29:33] <yrk> aggi_: trademark law and copyright law are orthogonal, please keep that in mind
[07:29:43] <jxself> +1
[07:30:12] <aggi_> anyway, "plagiarism" (fraud, theft) is problematic anyway, such as renaming a product from any vendor and distributing it with a different name/label
[07:30:46] <yrk> aggi_: since free software licenses permit that, it isn't an issue in the free software world
[07:31:15] <aggi_> firefox may not be free software, and GPL license doesn't cover all relevant legal aspects either, it can't
[07:31:21] <yrk> aggi_: some software, like mozilla, or ubuntu, also come with trademark terms. if you want to avoid them, remove the trademarked material
[07:31:34] <kakuhen> I mean, the 2/3-clause bsd license is very simple: give credit where credit's due. You can touch whatever you want except the copyright notices you "inherited" from the code.
[07:31:58] <kakuhen> so i fail to see how the plagarism thing comes into play unless you delete a license file or copyright texts
[07:32:09] <yrk> aggi_: gplv2 was understood in the same way. trademarked materials didn't make a gplv2-licensed program non-free either, unless it was purposefully designed to be hard to remove the trademarked material
[07:32:39] <aggi_> i don't delete any license or plagiarise anything, question was if renaming firefox to icecat is considered plagiarism and what consequences this might have
[07:32:59] <yrk> aggi_: in other words, the issues you raise have been recognized and worked around for at least the past 30 years with no major issues
[07:33:41] <kakuhen> aggi_: aah that's a different issue then. I've never bothered reading the MPL text, but I know what GNU did would not be an issue whatsoever under the terms of the BSD licenses.
[07:33:43] <yrk> you keep on using that word; I don't think it means what you think it means
[07:34:09] <kakuhen> I do recall an incident involving OpenBSD port maintainers and Pale Moon because of some stupid clause in the MPL, and it ended with the OpenBSD peeps just dropping the software from ports
[07:34:29] <kakuhen> https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip/issues/86
[07:34:46] <kakuhen> the offense seems very minor compared to the naming of GNU IceCat, but it does seem somewhat relevant for this discussion
[07:34:51] <yrk> deleting a license
[07:35:02] <yrk> ...what does that have to do with it?
[07:35:13] <jxself> Is it a problem to not use Mozilla's trademark? No. As a trademark holder you really don't want people to be changing the program around while still using your trademark on it. Look up the concept of "naked licensing."
[07:35:33] <jxself> It's a fast way to lose the trademark.

[16:59:08] <yrk> olle: gplv2, 30 years ago, already states that translations are derivative works (section 0): "(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
[16:59:08] <yrk> the term "modification".)"
[16:59:15] <olle> yrk: Yes, but if the logic itself changes?
[17:00:09] <olle> Let's say 80% is original, "translation", and 20% is new or changed.
[17:00:20] <yrk> olle: if you are standing in front of a judge, would you be confident in saying: "your honor, I fed program FOO into a computer, and I am confident that the new program BAR is a COMPLETELY NEW THING"
[17:01:19] <yrk> olle: have a look into reverse engineering. there is a reason why the concept of "clean room reverese engineering" exists
[17:01:44] <olle> Hm hm hm
[17:02:18] <olle> Alright, thanks. :)
[17:02:53] <yrk> olle: in conclusion, it is possible to reverse engineer and translate one program into another and have the new program not be a derivative. but making a program to do that is a far fetch. not impossible; just improbable

[17:05:58] <yrk> copyright is a government-granted exclusive property right meant to "protect" a work of original creation. I can imagine it being a very hard sell to stand before a judge and try to convince them that feeding a program into a machine will result in a work of original creation.

[20:47:01] <Noisytoot> ggoes, Why did you kick johns again?
[20:47:23] <ggoes> Noisytoot: johns's irc client (erc) has a bug to where you can't be in two channels of the same name at the same time
[20:47:34] <Noisytoot> report it
[20:47:49] <ggoes> bandali knows about it, the erc maintainer :)
[20:48:18] <ggoes> johns is going to try to come back in another client here in a bit i think
[20:48:26] <jemarch> rcirc supports it fine
[20:48:43] <bandali> i confirm
[20:48:58] <Noisytoot> Why does ERC not have SASL?

[20:50:08] *** Joins: maknho_ (~maknho@user/maknho)
[20:50:22] <corwin> the ERC work around is simply to run two (standalone, non-daemon/server) clients.

[21:06:58] <corwin> 26.3 was quite a bit more usable IIRC.  27 is *nice* except the multi-net bug which is complicated but def in progress.  I've def gotten more comfortable in ERC than anything else b4

[22:20:40] <yrk> so it seems that if I want to host git repos I'm still stuck with doing it myself, unless gitlab is acceptable?
[22:22:21] <yrk> I ask myself, do I want to put my project on a site that gets a "C" grade?
[22:23:09] *** Joins: zoe (~zoe@xdsl-31-164-88-63.adslplus.ch)
[22:25:21] <oaken-source> you don't need much to 'host' a git repository

[22:25:52] <jerome_> FSF Europe uses GitHub ... https://github.com/fsfe
[22:26:07] <yrk> oaken-source: I guess you are right. I have a few of those going. I was just wondering if there is a better thing out there.

[22:26:37] <denza242> jerome_: i'd assume that's a mirror? 
[22:26:48] <yrk> using github is absolutely not an option for me
[22:26:55] <oaken-source> I've come in contact with cgit a lot
[22:27:03] <oaken-source> never personally set one up though
[22:27:06] <denza242> and while github is nonfree and therefore not great, I think more mirrors is usually good
[22:27:34] <Noisytoot> yrk, If you don't want to self host, there's savannah.nongnu.org, codeberg.org, notabug.org, and sr.ht
[22:27:43] <oaken-source> https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/
[22:27:50] <oaken-source> there's an arch package
[22:28:03] <yrk> Noisytoot: I have projects on savannah, but this is for smaller things
[22:28:13] <yrk> Noisytoot: do you have a recommendation among those?
[22:28:50] <Noisytoot> I use Codeberg.org because Gitea is better than Gogs (used by notabug.org), and you will eventually have to pay to host stuff on sr.ht (when it stops being alpha)
[22:29:13] <yrk> Noisytoot: I'll check out codeberg; thanks

[22:31:24] <bandali> yrk, i think the situation with gitlab (specifically gitlab.com) is even worse. that C grade is due for a downgrade
[22:32:44] <yrk> bandali: oh dear
[22:32:51] <specing> yrk: There's a futureproof gitlabCE on salsa.debian.org
[22:33:14] <Noisytoot> specing, that requires recaptcha to sign up

[22:33:23] <Noisytoot> yes
[22:33:25] <yrk> bandali: I'm also considering writing in to savannah.nongnu and seeing if my project is appropriate for there
[22:33:26] <specing> sucks
[22:33:55] <specing> eeeh, savannah sucks
[22:34:28] <specing> > All JavaScript code served to the client is free, but does not work with LibreJS enabled.

[22:34:52] <specing> Or this
[22:35:29] <bandali> debian salsa running recaptcha must be a new thing. i don't remember it being there before
[22:35:37] <yrk> specing: savannah isn't the most modern (understatement). but as a person who writes in lisp and C, perhaps I don't get to complain about modern...
[22:36:51] <bandali> yrk, if it's not a very tiny/small project then savannah could be a good fit if the license for your project is gplv3+ compatible
[22:36:53] <specing> yrk: there is another complaint about savannah: the fact that non-gnu projects are at savannah.nongnu, makes them seem inferior
[22:37:24] <specing> they could fix this by hosting at idk, savannah.io or something
[22:37:49] <yrk> specing: I have two savannah projects; one on gnu and the other on nongnu. I've never noticed any difference
[22:38:05] <specing> The difference is in user perception
[22:38:41] <yrk> specing: they are both distributed via emacs elpa, so that difference is hidden from the people who use my software. I guess I don't interface with the problem you point out then
