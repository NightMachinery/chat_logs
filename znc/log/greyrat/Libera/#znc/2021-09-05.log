[20:34:59] <Khaytsus> KitsuWhooa: Exactly what network are you having issue with
[20:35:11] <Khaytsus> Because it's likely networks with really poor old certs
[20:47:58] <Casper> Like IRCnet. :p
[20:51:09] <Khaytsus> There's some "secure" network out there, talks about security, how secure they are, etc...... that uses like SUPER SUPER old expired certificates.  It's..  halarious.
[20:52:45] <Casper> Heh. heh. HEH.

[20:59:37] <KitsuWhooa> Yeah, it's mostly small networks, but IRCnet is the biggest one I couldn't connect to :p
[20:59:46] <KitsuWhooa> irc.atw-inter.net to be specific
[21:04:32] <Casper> Yeah, I've had the same issues with that. Stopped working a few days ago, so I'm just using port 6667 now for that.
[21:04:42] <Casper> It's not like I'm actually active on that network though. :P 
[21:12:06] <Khaytsus> KitsuWhooa: You could always revert that change, but...
[21:12:57] <KitsuWhooa> I ended up just adding that string at the end, so that next time I update znc I get a conflict and re-evaluate the situation :p
[21:13:09] <Casper> ZNC 1.8.2 has that issue also with IRCnet, it's not specifically the git version that's causing the issues.
[21:13:13] <KitsuWhooa> I'll try to contact the people running the networks
[21:13:20] <Casper> Heh, good luck.
[21:13:25] <KitsuWhooa> that's why I said try :D
[21:14:23] <KitsuWhooa> Ah, I didn't realise it made it into any releases. I didn't see any "tags" under the commit on github, so I assumed it hadn't
[21:14:52] <Casper> Eeeh, actually, nvm what I said.
[21:14:59] <Casper> The ZNC I'm using is indeed git :p
[21:15:13] <Casper> I was confused with another client that I used, which is still on 1.8.2
[21:15:28] <Casper> I did some testing with TLSv1.3 and used the git version for that, so that's currently still on there.
[21:15:56] <Casper> But the issue only started a few days ago though, SSL worked fine before that. So I still think something changed on IRCnet that's causing the issues.
[21:22:53] <KitsuWhooa> Hm, weird. For me it was fine, then I updated, and it stopped connecting, so *shrug*
[21:23:18] <Casper> You might've been connected for a few days already and in the meantime they updated something>? :P
[21:23:50] <KitsuWhooa> That would make sense

[22:08:00] <KitsuWhooa> And apparently setting the clock back makes znc time out from all networks

[22:32:27] <DarthGandalf> monotonic clock is supposed to be resistant to that
[22:32:48] <DarthGandalf> but I don't think ZNC ever does any distinction between different clocks
[22:32:51] <DarthGandalf> you can open a bug
[22:33:42] <KitsuWhooa> I might look into it later if I have time
[22:34:01] <KitsuWhooa> but then there's the mess of monotonic clocks not being available everywhere
[22:34:32] <DarthGandalf> they are not?
[22:34:37] <DarthGandalf> hm
[22:35:11] <KitsuWhooa> well, I was thinking cross platform
