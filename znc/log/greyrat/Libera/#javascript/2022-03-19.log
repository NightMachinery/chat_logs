[00:19:58] <blueagain> is not upgrading an option?
[00:20:07] <blueagain> given it's a major
[00:20:30] <sheetjs> people upgraded and discovered this issue, so technically rolling back is an option
[00:20:30] <blueagain> "not upgrading" as in "until this gets sorted out"
[00:21:38] <sheetjs> webpack 5 broke a huge number of libraries, and it will take a very long time for the entire dependency tree of popular libraries to fix
[00:22:14] <sheetjs> there's an actual workaround, but it requires modifying the webpack config.  CRA does not give you a backdoor to patch the config
[00:22:21] <sheetjs> at least, not without "ejecting"
[00:23:15] <blueagain> any reason the webpack config *wouldn't* be editable?
[00:23:24] <blueagain> sounds to me like a bit of a harsh preset

[00:29:36] <sheetjs> node-fetch v3 switched to ESM-only

[00:32:29] <blueagain> imho it's just good as an npm package, no idea why they'd add it to core
[00:32:31] <systemfault> We're not there yet... also, if you're writing a library, you may want to keep using node-fetch for a few NodeJS releases
[00:32:52] <sheetjs> request has been deprecated for years, yet https://www.npmjs.com/package/request
[00:33:07] <systemfault> Tons of people, including me, are not using the latest Node... but the latest LTS
[00:34:37] <blueagain> I could imagine though that in the case of node-fetch, they're trying to stay closer to the browser with esm, given it's a browser api
[00:35:01] <blueagain> but I'm probably correlating without a cause here
[00:35:38] <blueagain> "stay" well, or become closer
[00:35:59] <blueagain> maybe it's a deno influence
[00:36:28] <systemfault> One thing you can do now though... is to write your application/library and use "undici"'s fetch function (It's the one NodeJS is getting IIRC)
[00:37:40] <sheetjs> blueagain: the issue from the perspective of library authors is that you are imposing your limitations downstream

[00:38:29] *** Joins: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb)
[00:38:43] <sheetjs> so say you only offer ESM builds.  That not only means your direct users have to use a compatible node version, you also impose that on users of libraries that depend on your library
[00:38:53] <sheetjs> you can, but then you're shipping both
[00:39:25] <systemfault> blueagain: You need something like the "fix-esm" package to use ESM in CJS
[00:39:34] <systemfault> It's bad...
[00:39:38] <blueagain> is that really an issue though? I'm going to ignore my personal archlinux user case and say that anyone can install nvm and get an appropriate node version for esm
[00:39:38] *** Joins: nuclearg1 (~nucleargr@user/nuclearg1)
[00:39:58] <systemfault> At this point in time, offering ESM-only modules is just being a bad NodeJS ecosystem citizen... if there's such a thing

[00:40:44] <sheetjs> Up through Excel 2019, there were two sorts of annotations: "comments" and "notes"
[00:40:48] <blueagain> systemfault: what about completely new stuff? my stuff is only esm, but I have never written nor published it in cjs, it's rather new. would you think that appropriate in that case too?
[00:41:06] <sheetjs> Excel 2020 changed it so that what used to be "comments" are now "notes" and the new "threaded comments" became "comments"
[00:41:23] <sheetjs> it was a big breaking change because the actual content of the old comments were changed.  now there's a big message
[00:41:52] <blueagain> sheetjs: you're referring to how excel actually stores these annonations, as in the file format?
[00:41:59] <sheetjs> in the file format, correct
[00:42:12] <sheetjs> old-school notes were in VML, comments were in "comments"

[00:42:34] <systemfault> blueagain: Slightly less bad... a lot of people are not going to use your package because it's ESM-only but at least, it's not like telling people who used your package for a long time "Sorry, from now on, you're stuck with using the old version"

[00:53:32] <sheetjs> Numbers never published a spec and had 2 major file format redesigns, so it's hard to answer in the affirmative for .numbers files
[00:53:41] <blueagain> that largely depends on the format. if it's a pure text file, sure
[00:53:52] <blueagain> anything that is program-specific can only be answered in relation to the program itself

[00:54:49] <sheetjs> is that even true of plaintext? CSV is notoriously ambiguous since it mixes "content" and "presentation"

[02:36:14] <ljharb> iow, you're not describing a failure of public healthcare as a concept, you're describing a failure of implementation
[02:36:24] <systemfault> buu: I don't know if it's similar where you live, but here... it takes a lot of time to see "specialists", it's fine for normal doctors. As for the ER, it better be bad if you go or otherwise you're going to wait a long time (10 hours+)
[02:36:28] <ljharb> because it's hard to efficiently treat people fairly in capitalism.
[02:36:33] <blueagain> no, it's just government sucks at doing things. all the doctors I went to privately said they prefer private patients for the virtually 0 amount of bureaucracy involved with treating them, as opposed to the public system
[02:36:51] <ljharb> blueagain: maybe so. that means the government should get better, it doesn't mean they should stop doing things

[02:37:45] <blueagain> I can do it*
[02:37:46] <ljharb> if someone made a "private" system that everyone currently on public healthcare could switch to paying into, and do a better job, then you've just got a better system where the govt is subcontracting out the healthcare system
[02:37:59] <ljharb> blueagain: well sure, in your everyday life individuals don't care about systemic things like that
[02:38:16] <ljharb> blueagain: but that still doesn't mean the system should be scrapped. it just means you've identified a bunch of fixable flaws in it.
[02:38:35] <systemfault> blueagain: One good thing about a public system is that they're setting affordable prices for medication... because it's them who deal with Big Pharma.
[02:38:45] <blueagain> in theory it would be nice to make sure everyone gets a good treatment, but in every day life it sucks to have a back pain for 2 months and wait for someone to look at it when you know you could get it treated tomorrow.
[02:39:10] <ljharb> totally
[02:39:26] <ljharb> lol i live in the US, and no amount of money would get me in to a good back doctor in less than 2 months
[02:39:28] <systemfault> I often hear stories about insulin being stupidly expensive in the US..
[02:39:53] <ljharb> the good doctors all book up months in advance, because there's basically NO public healthcare

[03:25:43] <DPA> Also, we already have "sozialhilfe" for that. But it's way too harsh for when you already have money.
[03:25:49] <ljharb> blueagain: right but how do you define inflation? if it's "prices of essentials" then you've got your system, and luxuries will be more expensive
[03:25:55] <ljharb> DPA: no idea what that is

[03:26:25] <blueagain> average rise in the cost of consumer products?
[03:26:29] <blueagain> so probably not caviar
[03:26:43] <ljharb> i still suspect it's probably not accurate for UBI purposes, but you could come up with a tweaked metric
[03:26:43] <blueagain> unless caviar counts as "enjoy living" in your dictionary
[03:27:23] <DPA> ljharb: We already give people wo have lost everything a little bit of money so they can survive. But you do have to have prity much nothing left, and you may need to pay stuff back if you do get money somehow.

[09:48:53] <ljharb> buu: i mean, if there's a compelling enough proposal and use cases, `.match` and `.matchAll` could both take a callback as the second arg

[09:53:08] <ljharb> yep
[09:53:11] <ljharb> it's a terrible method
[09:53:13] <buu> what about string.substr
[09:53:13] <ljharb> it should be deleted
[09:53:17] <ljharb> substr is deprecated
[09:53:24] <buu> BUT SUBSTRING ISN'T?
[09:53:25] <ljharb> it's only in Annex B, because it had to be for web compat
[09:53:27] <ljharb> right
[09:53:31] <ljharb> that's why slice is the only good one
[09:53:33] <ljharb> !slice
[09:53:33] <jellobot> ljharb, "substr" is nonstandard/deprecated. "substring" can't handle negative indices, and weirdly sorts its arguments. "slice" works exactly as you'd expect, and identically to Array#slice. Always use slice on strings.
[09:53:36] <buu> how is that logical
[09:53:46] <ljharb> it's not logical, but it's the best we could do what with history
[09:53:53] <buu> substr is like slice but better because it takes a length
[09:53:58] <ljharb> obv it we were starting from scratch, there'd only be one method, and it'd be slice
[09:54:08] <ljharb> most use cases don't need to pass the length tho

[09:54:27] <buu> ljharb: are you familiar with perl's substr
[09:54:35] <ljharb> iow, between substr and slice, there's some use cases where one of them requires computation and the other doesn't
[09:54:41] <ljharb> buu: you could have stopped at "perl", no
[09:54:43] <ljharb> i'm not 60

[09:55:11] <buu> wait no 36
[09:55:32] <ljharb> lol then why are you using the language of your ancestors
[09:55:38] <buu> It pays well
[09:55:44] <ljharb> JS pays well too
[09:55:49] <ljharb> anyways like i said, there's definitely some use cases where substr is simpler than slice
[09:55:50] <buu> Well, it didn't 10 years ago
[09:55:58] <ljharb> but, the length computation is pretty trivial in either case
[09:56:00] <buu> substr EXPR,OFFSET,LENGTH,REPLACEMENT
[09:56:18] <ljharb> and there's *more* cases where slice is simpler than where substr is simpler, based on the anecdata of my decade+ of experience
[09:56:23] <buu> Perl's substr takes 3 arguments 2 of which are optional
[09:56:33] <buu> ljharb: Yeah that's the proof I want
[09:56:37] <ljharb> so even from scratch, i wouldn't be opposed to both substr and slice existing, with better names and slightly better behavior

[12:44:09] <D4mned> well thats css
[12:44:26] <D4mned> you need to inspect them in browser and see whats causing that gap
[12:45:38] <codebam> neither of the <pre> consume the gap, so I think the outer div must be doing something to add it

[14:48:19] <OhTheCode> blueagain: thanks. I was looking at some source code of some libraries I use , in the src/lib directory and the good libraries avoid using .forEach because IE and the small browsers don't support it (for both NodeList and array)
[14:50:41] <crashrep> Hey, when i add a row to a table via document.getElementById("id"), row = table.insertRow(-1), cell = row.insertCell(-1), is it possible to change the attributes of this cell? For example if i wanted to change colspan or rowspan?
[14:53:01] <OhTheCode> use .setAttribute()
[14:53:43] <blueagain> crashrep: insertCall() returns a reference to the cell, which you can then normally manipulate

[15:47:13] <knstn> Hello. There are 2 buttons with the same class on a page. I want to click the second  with a script. The problem is that using the class clicks the first, wrong one: document.querySelector('.floating-button.clickable.layout-align-center-center.layout-row').click()
[15:48:58] <qswz> .querySelectorAll(...)[1]?.click()
[15:49:04] <blueagain> knstn: you could use querySelectorAll(...)[1] to get the second result, or much better, be able to identify the second button uniquely

[23:41:11] <sheetjs> so the solution is a dynamic key, but to make it work in JS you have to wrap the square brackets in a special comment

[23:41:54] <jellobot> (okay) 2
[23:42:02] <buu>         What is this nonsense
[23:42:22] <blueagain> sheetjs: why not just use an array in this case, or would it be sparse?

[23:42:49] <sheetjs> the XLSB object has 858 entries and the largest index index is 5099
[23:43:01] <blueagain> oh, figures
[23:43:03] <sheetjs> we toyed with a dynamic construction, but webpack couldn't tree-shake it
[23:44:01] <sheetjs> and flow doesnt work with the numeric pattern https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/380
[23:44:17] <blueagain> why is n always commented out
[23:44:41] <sheetjs> again, webpack couldn't tree-shake.  originally there were switch blocks that switched on the name
[23:44:53] <sheetjs> to reduce the bloat, it now switches on the index
[23:45:09] <blueagain> how do you not get crazy writing such code
[23:45:24] <blueagain> this is my worst nightmare
[23:45:28] <sheetjs> honestly, google investing in our destruction is a bigger nightmare
[23:45:54] <sheetjs> haha or facebook "stripping attributions"
[23:46:12] <sheetjs> this was 7 years ago, in the public, in the react repo of all places.  turns out it was actually a larger problem within facebook too

[23:46:52] <sheetjs> "just strip the current SheetJS license" ended up becoming a common theme
[23:47:15] <blueagain> oh, they're claiming they've replaced enough to strip the license?
[23:47:18] <blueagain> I'm not sure that's how it works
[23:47:23] <blueagain> at least legally
[23:48:02] <sheetjs> of course that isn't how it works, but it's how facebook engineers apparently operate
[23:48:22] <sheetjs> legal questions aside, it's not how open source should work
[23:49:03] <blueagain> I read somewhere that even if you read someone else's source code, and you write down from memory, that that code might still be protected by the original license
[23:49:39] <blueagain> so even starting from scratch isn't a criterion

[23:50:04] <buu> blueagain: well, that's the fun part about how copyright applies to ideas
[23:50:28] <buu> blueagain: If you have an idea and i have the same idea we have to fight to the death to see who owns the idea
[23:50:32] <sheetjs> there are legal concepts of "derivative works" that vary between jurisdictions
[23:50:47] <sheetjs> buu: or race, there was a recent case about that
[23:50:53] *** Joins: noarb (~noarb@user/noarb)
[23:50:59] <sheetjs> involving crispr
[23:51:21] <blueagain> buu: even if we both arrived at it, we might have had different paths and that would show in the history of our projects
[23:51:44] <blueagain> like leibniz and newtone
[23:51:56] <blueagain> not claiming, of course, you or I are anywhere close those two :)
[23:52:04] <blueagain> newton*
[23:52:50] <buu> blueagain: Sure, but that's not the how modern copyright works, only one person can own it regardless of how you "invented" it
[23:52:50] <sheetjs> irrespective of the legal question, given the social norms around open source, people tend to frown upon that behavior
[23:53:02] <buu> well, this gets into patents
[23:53:27] <buu> blueagain: But a while ago amazon managed to claim ownership of the idea of storing people's credit cards on the backend so they didn't have to enter them when they wanted to buy something

[23:54:53] <blueagain> sheetjs: that reminds me of those pictures shot by a monkey
[23:55:23] <blueagain> the owner of the monkey claimed copyright, it got to court, I think they established animals can't own copyright

[23:59:45] <blueagain> can't you sue?
[23:59:55] <blueagain> they're in violation of the license, no?
