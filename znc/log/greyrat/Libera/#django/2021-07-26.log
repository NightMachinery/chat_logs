[08:46:11] <Steve-Dusty> it's simplistic and unopinionated
[08:46:33] <Quacc> so what does it have thats better than flask
[08:46:36] <Steve-Dusty> Django is a full framework with features out of the box
[08:46:39] <dodo> Quacc: most things you need are built-in, well integrated and documented
[08:46:52] <Steve-Dusty> it uses the MTV model
[08:46:55] <Quacc> yes but what
[08:46:57] <Steve-Dusty> MVC*
[08:47:02] <Steve-Dusty> Model View Controler
[08:47:23] <Steve-Dusty> you need to structure your directory in a specific way
[08:47:28] <dodo> Quacc: have you done the django tutorial yet?
[08:47:32] <Steve-Dusty> no
[08:48:12] <Steve-Dusty> Quacc if I were to make a facebook clone, I'd use Django whereas if I'm just going to build like a simple blog or functionality I'd use flask
[08:49:42] <Steve-Dusty> Django offers more features than Flask
[08:50:05] <Steve-Dusty> for example, I can easily make a signup/login feature

[10:05:19] <hemebond> I'm unhappy with my current solution for handling the conversion of comma-separated strings in a form text input to a m2m relationship, getting or creating instances as necessary. Anyone got a good example of "the way" to handle it?
[10:05:46] *** deniska_ is now known as deniska
[10:08:28] <IceMichael> how is csv even m2m? are you looking for better UI or csv algorithm?
[10:11:41] <hemebond> Package.authors is to Author. I want the form field to be a single text input of comma-separated values that creates Authors if they don't exist and saves the author_set to the Package.
[10:11:41] *** Quits: Steve-Dusty (~Steve-Dus@user/steve-dusty) (Quit: Client closed)
[10:13:18] <hemebond> Right now I handle the saving and creation in the view and that seems wrong (maybe it isn't) with a custom form field that parsing the string into a list of names.

[10:16:21] <IceMichael> still unsure what the problem is. custom form field that transfers into authors seems to be what you want
[10:17:42] <hemebond> I guess it's this part that I don't like https://gitlab.com/hemebond/slipcrate/-/blob/main/slipcrate/packages/views.py#L299-312
[10:18:21] <IceMichael> 404, probably private repo?
[10:18:25] <hemebond> In that link they use a custom manager. That seems the correct way. Just wondering if anyone else had a better method.
[10:18:32] <hemebond> Oh it's private? Dang.
[10:19:09] <hemebond> https://dpaste.org/o0Nx
[10:19:32] <hemebond> ^ that's in the edit view
[10:19:48] <dre> if I have a model with a boolean field
[10:19:49] <hemebond> The Package add/create view has something similar.
[10:19:54] <dre> and I want to use a ModelForm
[10:20:13] <IceMichael> I would bulkify it, if there are many authors that gets slow fast. But maybe not critical for user-provided input here
[10:20:38] <dre> and I want the MOdelForm to have a ChoiceField of [(True, "Should do X thing"),(False, "Should do Y thing")] as a radioselect.
[10:20:42] <IceMichael> what don't you like about it, though?
[10:21:02] <dre> is there any way I can use the ChoiceField(... widget=RadioSelect) to act as the Boolean attribute on my ModelForm ?
[10:21:25] <hemebond> IceMichael: Feels wrong 😆 Feels like it should be encapsulated somewhere more appropriate.
[10:21:41] <hemebond> dre: Why not a checkbox?
[10:21:44] <IceMichael> dre, with custom fields there is at least... Overriding the converters (to_representation etc.)
[10:22:59] <dre> yeah I think that's probably the way to go about it
[10:23:15] <dre> but I just wanted to see if there was a way I could change the field without having to change too much :x
[10:24:28] <IceMichael> hemebond, ah.. yeah, maybe your field should just give you author names as a list (i.e. to string to list). In your view, you could then process it. Or, if you want to separate more, put it in a custom queryset or, if unappropriate, some extra file (whatever your backend structure is like, could also be services.py which some don't like)
[10:26:18] <hemebond> I like the idea of bulk create. Will look into that. I'll also test out the custom manager bit.

[10:32:22] <IceMichael> okay, why not. As said, for me it's even cleaner to use your code and move it to some extra function
[10:32:53] <IceMichael> the task of converting a list of author names to authors in your database is pure database/processing work and I prefer having these separated
[10:33:49] <IceMichael> however, I still have no best practice on where to put such functions that affect multiple tables at once...
[10:33:57] <hemebond> Oh I haven't disregarded your suggestion of a separate function or file.
[10:34:36] <hemebond> It does all need to stay within the transaction so I'll have to do some testing.
[10:34:44] <IceMichael> no worries, maybe it's already like it, I would just extract it from the view, too :)
[10:35:00] <IceMichael> but how to name the file where to put it is probably open enough

[14:54:22] <ioO> Hi, I am trying to  use the per-site cache with memcache but in djdt my cache panel is saying 0 calls.
[14:54:45] <ioO> I installed memcached, it runs on my linux.
[14:55:10] <ioO>  I add pymemcache as requirements and the CACHES settings.
[14:55:21] <ioO> I also add MIDDLEWARES in settings.
[14:55:32] <ioO>  The website is only using admin so my urls.py include only admin.site.urls (and djdt for dev). What I need to do now ?
[14:59:17] <hemebond> ioO: You don't have an actual app with models?
[14:59:56] <ioO> I have 4 apps with models and they have an admin.py
[15:02:18] <hemebond> I've not used it before unfortunately.
[15:02:33] <FunkyBob> you might need to be more specific
[15:02:40] <FunkyBob> like... which middlewares yhou configured
[15:02:46] <FunkyBob> how you verified your caching config is working
[15:02:53] <FunkyBob> and... why you're using whole-site caching to begin with
[15:02:56] <hemebond> There's no middleware mentioned in the docs.
[15:03:39] <FunkyBob> ioO: ?
[15:03:52] <ioO> FunkyBob https://dpaste.org/9S53 the middlewares
[15:04:35] *** Joins: sandeepk (~sandeepk@223.130.30.29)
[15:04:49] <ioO> I also add caches settings
[15:05:02] <hemebond> Oh I see, the per-site caching requires middleware.
[15:05:57] <FunkyBob> yes...
[15:06:06] <FunkyBob> still waiting for an answre to any of my questions
[15:07:48] <FunkyBob> ioO: ?
[15:07:48] <ioO> I am using the whole-site caching because the website is low due to sql queries. The project is 11 years old and I am moving from 1.3 to 3.2.5. At this time I am just trying to update the code, I will refactor code at a second time.
[15:08:09] <FunkyBob> then optimise your queries, instead of introducing problems from caching
[15:08:59] <FunkyBob> and  yes, caching _will_ introduce problems
[15:09:05] <ioO> yes I know
[15:09:25] <FunkyBob> DDT won't show you the queries, because the hits on te chache happen before or after it
[15:09:38] <FunkyBob> before it for hits, and after for updates
[15:11:10] <ioO> ok so my cache is not working, I will have another try with shell
[15:12:03] <FunkyBob> well, at 1/3 questions answered at least
[15:12:08] <dang`r`us> a shell is a poor replacement for a cache
[15:12:27] <dang`r`us> (reimplementing varnish in bash)
[15:16:19] <ioO> I just do this basic test https://pymemcache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#basic-usage and it works
[15:18:11] <FunkyBob> *sigh*
[15:18:13] <ioO> What I expected when I installed the cache is that the results of queries will be cached. And djdt shows always the same number of queries not 0 at a 2nd call
[15:18:25] <FunkyBob> ...
[15:18:31] <FunkyBob> are you here to complain, or here to get help?
[15:18:45] <FunkyBob> if you want help, you need to (a) provide answers to our questions
[15:18:50] <FunkyBob> and (b) listen to our responses
[15:19:34] <ioO> I just describe what I expect it is not a complain
[15:19:42] <FunkyBob> you've ignored what we've said
[15:19:48] <FunkyBob> so maybe instead of coming here to seek help
[15:19:50] <FunkyBob> you just wanted to v ent
[15:20:00] <ioO> about queries ?
[15:20:02] <FunkyBob> no
[15:20:17] <FunkyBob> you never said which middleware you configured... just hinted
[15:20:27] <FunkyBob> you never said how you'd verified your caching config was correct
[15:20:36] <ioO> ok sorry I did not get that point.
[15:20:55] <FunkyBob> what point is there to get?
[15:21:13] <ioO> the middleware
[15:21:43] <ioO> For the caching I redo the basic usage to see if it works.
[15:22:23] <FunkyBob> ...
[15:22:23] <ioO> I was thinking that the paste of my settings are enough for middleware
[15:22:26] <FunkyBob> what point is there to get?
[15:22:38] <FunkyBob> state exactly what config changes you made to enable the middleware
[15:22:45] <FunkyBob> no
[15:22:48] <FunkyBob> it's not enough
[15:23:03] <FunkyBob> it gives us a huge list of middleware, and no statement of EXACTLY what you changed
[15:23:14] <FunkyBob> don't make us guess
[15:24:38] <ioO> I just change the settings. No more, because it seems be enough to have cache.
[15:25:56] <FunkyBob> ...
[15:26:05] <FunkyBob> yes, but which settings?  and how?
[15:27:21] <ioO> https://dpaste.org/cVzp
[15:28:23] <FunkyBob> try disabling DjDT
[15:29:28] *** Joins: Tas-sos (~Tas-sos@78-74-51.adsl.cyta.gr)
[15:30:16] <FunkyBob> or does djdt no longer set cookies?
[15:31:34] <ioO> I disable djdt. I watch for cookies
[15:33:10] <ioO> One cookie was for djdt, I delete all cookies to have a fresh session
[15:33:20] <FunkyBob> are you logged into admin?
[15:33:54] <ioO> yes
[15:34:25] <FunkyBob> well, that won't help, either
[15:34:53] <ioO> ok, why do you think that ?
[15:35:50] <FunkyBob> the default caching is very conservative... it doesn't want to accidentally show content to the wrong user
[15:36:03] <FunkyBob> check the headers... is there a Cache-Control header?
[15:36:15] <FunkyBob> does it say 'private' in it?
[15:37:15] <ioO> Do I paste here the header ?
[15:37:28] <ioO> max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private
[15:37:42] <FunkyBob> private
[15:37:55] <FunkyBob> so it will never cache content with that
[15:38:31] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/middleware/cache.py#L89
[15:39:53] <ioO> ok :D  but it's a good practice against cache abuse
[15:42:12] <ioO> if I understand, I can't cache objects (result of queries) using the per-site cache ?
[15:42:31] <FunkyBob> no,  you do not understand
[15:42:38] <FunkyBob> wait
[15:42:43] <FunkyBob> per-site cache?
[15:42:46] <FunkyBob> what per-site cache?
[15:42:51] <FunkyBob> you enabled the _whole_ site cache
[15:42:54] <FunkyBob> page caching
[15:43:23] <ioO> sorry I was reading the doc in same time... the whole site
[15:43:33] <FunkyBob> caching querysets is generally a bad idea
[15:43:41] <FunkyBob> there is a section in the docs on it...
[15:44:17] <ioO> no in fact per-site is whole site in the doc
[15:45:21] <FunkyBob> sure, but it's page caching... not querysets or lower levels like that
[15:45:38] <FunkyBob> you really should be using DjDT to find out where you'd benefit from select_related or prefetch_related
[15:50:51] <ioO> yep I think I have no other quick way to handle this amount of queries. (55k to change_view :D  )

[21:10:33] <ironbeard> Does the `stringformat` template tag not allow for percentage formatting? Am I missing something here, or do I need to make my own template tag to turn the value of a DecimalField into a percentage?

[21:13:30] <Steve-Dusty> Is it possible to allow IP
[21:13:45] <Steve-Dusty> IP blocking in Django
[21:14:21] <GinFuyou> Yes, but it's likely not something you *should* do in django
[21:14:23] <Steve-Dusty> a library to do that. right now im thinking about creating a new model that stores IPs. It'll be related to Choices and votes..
[21:14:29] <ironbeard> Possibly, using `user_passes_test` but I think you shoudl do it with your server
[21:14:35] <Steve-Dusty> so people can only vote once
[21:14:43] <Steve-Dusty> (if they don't use proxies)
[21:14:49] <Steve-Dusty> GinFuyou why not?
[21:15:14] <GinFuyou> IP filtering for voting is probably a bad idea
[21:15:15] <ironbeard> They probably thought (like I did) that you meant blocking access to the site as a whole, which should be done before it hits the app
[21:15:32] <GinFuyou> Exactly
[21:15:40] <Steve-Dusty> oh I meant that shouldn't vote twice on the same IP
[21:15:51] <Steve-Dusty> I don't really want to require others to sign in to vote
[21:16:08] <ironbeard> I think you could do that with sessions. If they cleared their cookies I supposed they'd be able to bypass it, but :shrug:
[21:16:27] <Steve-Dusty> ok, but why are IPs a bad idea?
[21:16:39] <GinFuyou> Different people could have same IP when they are behind NAT, and most users are probable like that
[21:17:13] <Steve-Dusty> how do you hide behind NAT?
[21:17:25] <ironbeard> Yeah, good point. My office has a single IP address
[21:17:33] <GinFuyou> Maybe limiting IP for some times to block most dumb forcing could work
[21:17:36] <ironbeard> So only one person at my office (~20 people) could vote
[21:17:44] <Steve-Dusty> oh
[21:18:16] <GinFuyou> Anyway, you should first do some research on it
[21:18:44] <ioO> ironbeard : do you get your value from a modelPercentField ?
[21:18:45] <GinFuyou> I don't think there is a simple all-around solution
[21:19:47] <ironbeard> @ioO oh duh, I didn't realize django had a PercentField these days.. I'll look into that
[21:20:10] <GinFuyou> Django sessions can be a reasonable way to prevent most silly cases
[21:20:17] <GinFuyou> with minimal effort
[21:20:26] <ironbeard> oh wait, looks like PercentField is part of django-extras?
[21:20:32] <GinFuyou> Anything smart would probably account for several factors

[21:23:55] *** Joins: domhnall (~developer@user/domhnall/x-2887755)
[21:24:04] <ioO> I also extend forms.DecimalField to validate positive between 0 -100
[21:24:13] <GinFuyou> Steve-Dusty, it works in acceptable time that promise to scale it's good. But aggregation is almost always better
[21:24:22] <GinFuyou> *if
[21:24:48] <Steve-Dusty>  I can't figure out how to use aggregation :(
[21:24:52] <Steve-Dusty> to Count
[21:25:25] <GinFuyou> it's probably annotate Count + aggregate Sum
[21:25:36] <ironbeard> @ioO ah, no worries. I don't really need the validation, since the percentage is really more of a "Compound Annual Growth Rate," I just want to store as decimal and display in template as percentage. But, I just made a quick template filter.. I was just suprised that the `stringformat:'+0.2%'` didn't work
[21:27:08] <GinFuyou>  question.choice_set.annotate(vote_count=Count("vote")).aggregate(Sum("vote_count"))  # something like that perhaps
[21:27:37] <Steve-Dusty> wait
[21:27:38] <GinFuyou> ah, wait votes is field
[21:27:45] <Steve-Dusty> yes
[21:27:50] <Steve-Dusty> if you're just going to Count("vote") why Sum it all up?
[21:27:55] <Steve-Dusty> Doesnt Count do that for you?
[21:27:55] <GinFuyou> then just aggregate
[21:28:24] <Steve-Dusty> the docs doesn't explain clearly what annotate is.
[21:28:42] <GinFuyou> no, you need a sum of numeric field, so here you need Sum
[21:29:45] <GinFuyou> question.choice_set.aggregate(Sum(votes))
[21:29:47] <ioO> ironbeard I think you should use ```{{ value|stringformat:'.2f' }}%``` in your templates
[21:30:05] <Steve-Dusty> then what's Count?
[21:30:12] <GinFuyou> * "votes" probably
[21:30:28] <ioO> don't take care of multiple `, bad formating
[21:30:28] <GinFuyou> Steve-Dusty, Count counts number of rows
[21:30:41] <ironbeard> @ioO: but that wouldn't multiply by 100, but yeah.. I see whatcha mean

[21:30:55] <Steve-Dusty> 0o nice
[21:31:32] <GinFuyou> e.g. question.choice_set.count() gives count of all choices, analogue of python len(question.choice_set.all())
[21:32:49] <ioO> ironbeard : yep it's a decimal, you store the value as 0.1234  or 12.34 for 12.34% ?
[21:33:34] <GinFuyou> Question.objects.annotate(count=Count('choice')).aggregate(Sum('count')) would have given number of all choices for all (or subset of) Questions

[21:35:36] <ironbeard> My templatetag works, I'm just surprised django's `stringformat` didn't allow percentage formatting
[21:37:06] <ioO> it's because it uses old python string formating which has no percent formatting https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting
