[17:16:36] <ente> I'm trying to compile nyxt and the compilation fails trying to find lfp.h... which library is that from?
[17:18:28] <ente> (lemme consult the developer readme)
[17:19:54] <ente> libfixposix maybe
[17:20:32] <ente> it's not packaged here
[17:22:34] <edgarvincent[m]> ente: It is indeed provided by libfixposix.
[17:22:36] <edgarvincent[m]> Which distribution are you using?
[17:22:55] <ente> opensuse
[17:23:55] <ente> there's a 3rd party repo that contains it
[17:25:48] <edgarvincent[m]> ente: https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home:sionescu&package=libfixposix
[17:26:01] <edgarvincent[m]> ah, yes ^^
[17:26:38] <ente> yeah I got someone else's now ^^
[17:26:47] <ente> they should just put it into the official repo, it seems useful
[17:26:56] <ente> anyway nyxt compiled \o/
[17:29:19] <ente> first impression: emacsy look, but no emacsy feel. I'm confused

[17:41:30] <nij-> 1. I'm following the section "Run from source" in https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/blob/master/documents/README.org#standard-developer-installation
[17:42:27] <nij-> And got a bit confused.. after I evaluate asdf:load-asd, does ql:quickload know that it should load the just-loaded asd file? Or will it go on quicklisp online repo and fetch the latest nyxt there?
[17:42:53] <nij-> 2. Running from source is nice and lispy. However, I don't get a terminal that shows the debugging message. What's a way to surround that?
[17:54:29] <Jing> nij- ql:quickload knows it should load the just-loaded ASD file
[17:55:00] <Jing> What do you mean by the debugging message? Do you mean debugging message when developing?
[17:56:07] <Jing> There's a way to have log and/or debugging msg, but I forgot the commands...
[17:56:20] <nij-> Oh! i can dig into that. Nice
[17:57:18] <nij-> I'm not sure I'm doing it right.. The current master branch does have the command edit-user-file-with-external-editor,
[17:57:19] <Jing> Something related to log:debug or log:info in the code, or log4cl...
[17:57:49] <nij-> but the nyxt run from source  doesn't seem to have that command
[17:58:34] <nij-> NYXT> #'edit-user-file-with-external-editor  ;; ; Debugger entered on #<UNDEFINED-FUNCTION EDIT-USER-FILE-WITH-EXTERNAL-EDITOR {10043895B3}>
[17:59:31] <Jing> Can you use it as a command?
[17:59:33] <nij-> Thus I'm not sure if ql:quickload loaded the correct version @@
[17:59:42] <nij-> No, it's not in the command list either (M-x..)
[18:00:06] <nij-> In the command list, I do see edit-with-external-editor
[18:15:19] <nij-> NYXT> (nyxt-version) ;; <INFO> [08:45:08] Version 2.1.0
[18:15:55] <nij-> So I think ql:quickload doesn't load the just-loaded nyxt.
[18:21:49] <Jing> Did you execute "(ql:quickload :nyxt/gi-gtk)" this?
[18:21:58] <Jing> or just (ql:quickload :nyxt)?
[18:24:00] <nij-> I did the former!
[18:24:53] <Jing> Interesting... then I do not know
[18:25:05] <Jing> since our latest version is clearly not 2.1.0
[18:34:10] <nij-> With that assured.. hmm I think the problem is that I had installed nyxt before. So maybe quickload uses that as priority.
[18:34:27] <nij-> Now, uninstall the old nyxt does make quickload to start pulling the latest stuff.
[18:34:35] <nij-> However, "nhooks" system is missing.
[18:34:54] <nij-> Now, I understand that I might have to pull the dependencies from .gitmodules manually.
[18:35:05] <nij-> But isn't there an automatic way for that?

[20:05:55] <jmercouris> I was about to tell you how to do it
[20:06:12] <jmercouris> Just clone nhooks into your ~/common-lisp folder and it will work
[20:06:28] <jmercouris> Or whatever folder you’ve specified for ASDF to look
[20:06:49] <jmercouris> nij-: ^
[20:07:08] <jmercouris> Not all of our dependencies are on QL

[20:16:49] <nij-> Yes, that's the officially provided solution.
[20:17:05] <nij-> The other dependencies might be on QL, but could also be old.
[20:17:19] <nij-> So I think the safest way is to pull all dependencies listed in .gitmodules.
[20:17:53] <nij-> But there are a lot.. so I'm hoping if there's a programmatic way to do that. Something like `$ git pull all from .gitmodules to ~/common-lisp`.
