[05:20:37] <underdoge> hi guys quick question when will the 4.3.0 version be available as a snap package?
[05:25:53] <xnaas> the snap package is unofficial as far as I know
[05:26:01] <xnaas> so that would be up to whoever unofficially maintains it
[05:26:56] <underdoge> ok thank you!
[05:28:13] <xnaas> underdoge: https://github.com/snapcrafters/thelounge/issues/17
[05:28:40] <xnaas> (that's where the snap page led to, as far as I could tell)

[20:42:47] <muirrum> shadoozo: apk add thelounge
[20:43:01] <muirrum> using https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/community/x86_64/thelounge
[20:43:15] <bookworm> unless you host for others as well of course
[20:43:22] <muirrum> bookworm: i'm an op on the other network and I don't like seeing the default :p
[20:43:35] <bookworm> ah ^^
[20:47:36] <bookworm> didn't knew that TL is in the official repos, nice
[20:48:36] <muirrum> it's in edge/community but :p
[20:51:38] <bookworm> is that like the AUR in Arch land? I don't use Alpine nor know much about it outside of docker land
[20:53:26] <muirrum> i think testing is more like the AUR than community
[20:53:31] <muirrum> https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Enable_Community_Repository
[20:55:49] <bookworm> yeah, just googled my way over to the wiki
[21:01:16] <timsan> I think  you can use snapd on Alpine as well 
[21:01:39] <muirrum> yeah but why would i want to use snapd :p
[21:01:41] <timsan> though, if Alpine has its own TL package, the better 
[21:02:04] <timsan> If you use snapd, you will have a very recent version. And it updates itself automagically
[21:02:24] <muirrum> if i use snapd, i have to use snapd. i'd rather just use apk
[21:02:42] <timsan> there are pro's and cons of snapd 
[21:02:53] <timsan> My experience using snapd has been very good
[21:03:33] <timsan> I got TL installed, using the TL .deb's -- and this has been very stable so far

[21:14:29] <muirrum> well, same with APK, but I flagged the package :)
[21:14:37] <bookworm> also snaps are strictly worse than proper packages... they simply paper over the distro problems of shipping ages old versions in their "stable" release. That can be fixed by just shipping up to date packages rather than full os tarballs
[21:14:44] <bookworm> we already have docker for that
[21:15:17] <bookworm> and TL is easy enough on the deps to not be an issue
[21:15:42] <bookworm> All you need is a LTS node that's still in the support cycle
[21:27:25] <muirrum> ok so it's not getting recorded in the logs either
