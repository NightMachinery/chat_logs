[13:35:25] <kib> hey if I'm downloading a playlist how do i tell yt-dlp to download every vid in 480p?

[13:49:07] <Mateon1> List the formats on any video with -F, then use the -f flag. It will apply to all videos in the playlist. Note that if the format doesn't exist (eg, the video is lower res than 480p, or youtube for some reason does not provide 480p, which sometimes happens), then that video will fail.
[13:49:13] <Mateon1> I'm not sure if 480p is a DASH format or not
[13:49:28] <kib> -S "res: 480"
[13:49:38] <kib> or -S "height: 480" which is what i used
[13:49:50] <Mateon1> Without looking up the codes you can also do something like -f 'best[height=480]/bestvideo[height=480]+bestaudio/best[height<480]'
[13:49:52] <kib> lemme see if it works, I've gone ahead and downloaded them anyway
[13:53:27] <Mateon1> Looks like 480p is a DASH format nowadays, so bestvideo+bestaudio applies. The format code for 480p is 135 for avc (aka mp4 video) format, or 244 for vp9, so you'd use something like -f '(244/135/bestvideo[height<480])+bestaudio/best'
