[19:29:52] <Oblomov> hello all
[19:30:44] <Oblomov> I have the impression that quantum:maximum is being ignored in the integer case, or I've failed to understand how it works
[19:32:28] <Oblomov> my situation is the following: I have files in a proprietary format that stores 10 bits significant data per channel. I wrote a small program that extracts this and and writes out a MIFF file with 16-bits integers per pixel, separate channels
[19:33:13] <Oblomov> if I visualize the data with e.g. display -equalize, I do see the values getting stretched appropriately, but if I use e.g. -define quantum:maximum=1024, it comes out black
[19:33:26] <Oblomov> the problem with -equalize is that it stretches things too much
[19:33:40] <Oblomov> I also tried e.g. with -define quantum:scale=64, but still not good
[19:33:48] <hyrcanus_> good luck Oblomov 
[19:34:09] <Oblomov> hyrcanus_: well thanks 8-D
[19:34:27] <hyrcanus_> i'm investigating gimp wrongness myself
[19:34:28] <Oblomov> hyrcanus_: are you saying there's no chance to make this work?
[19:34:40] <hyrcanus_> no but someone familiar with the source would need to help
[19:36:07] <hyrcanus_> you sound competent enough to dive in
[20:07:31] <Oblomov> oh, -level 0,1024
