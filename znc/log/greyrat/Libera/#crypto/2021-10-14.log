[15:52:49] <maroon> Am I correct that the image at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_asymmetric_encryption_padding#Algorithm is wrong?
[15:53:01] <maroon> It shows the top row as ( m || 0x00's || rand) but from what I see of RFC 3447 OAEP should be ( lHash || 0x00's || 0x01 || m || rand)
[15:53:09] <maroon> The article references the earlier RFC 2437, but that shows the same as 3447 does except lacking the leading 0x00 on the bottom row that prevents the 'EM' from being greater than the public key 'n'

[17:19:29] <Chouhartem> maroon, apparently in https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/courses/cs255_winter12/lectures/rsa.pdf , page 13 he stated that the output of OAEP lives in a n-1 bit space (and thus avoid overflowing. I guess when you decrypt you also check that the most significant bit is indeed 0 over n bits, but it's just technicalities)

[17:24:45] <maroon> well the RFC keeps saying octets, and if the size really is n-1, then seems it would involve the hash crossing byte boundaries

[17:39:08] <MacGyver> maroon: Other way around.
[17:39:26] <MacGyver> maroon: The output is supposedly guaranteed to have a MSB of 0 if it's n bits wide.
[17:39:47] <MacGyver> maroon: So it doesn't cross that boundary.
[17:42:53] <maroon> MacGyver, i'm talking about the input, where https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2437#section-9.1.1.1 shows EM = maskedseed || maskedDB, where the input is going to have that highest bit set half the time
[17:43:40] <maroon> but in the diagram it in effect shows EM = maskedDB || masked seed, also without something to avoid highest bit being 1
[17:45:27] <maroon> but as for the output of RSA, it's not guaranteed for MSB to be 0, just that output is smaller than 'n'

[18:01:00] <maroon> ok, and the newer RFC is just including the 0x00 at the front to be more explicit about the length. so then the only discrepancy is that there's 2 different designs, where one has the randseed at the front and the other has it at the tail end.

[23:36:21] <tuskkk____>  I have a binary format encoded in hex strings, how do I find the human readable string from it?
[23:36:41] <tuskkk____> e.g `"\xa0\x1d\x81\x80\x00\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x07\x65\x78\x61"
[23:36:48] <tuskkk____> e.g `"\xa0\x1d\x81\x80\x00\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x07\x65\x78\x61"`
[23:37:56] <sarnold> easy thing to do is: printf "\xa0\x1d\x81\x80\x00\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x07\x65\x78\x61" | xxd
[23:38:36] <sarnold> if you intend on doing this kind of stuff for more than this one string, maybe https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/ can help out, it's got a lot of handy little utilities for converting things around
[23:40:06] <tuskkk____> printing that shows, `00000000: a01d 8180 0001 0001 0000 0000 0765 7861  .............exa`, not sure what it means
[23:40:17] <tuskkk____> thanks for sharing this cool utility, checking it out
[23:41:05] <ms7821> if you actually want to decode the binary format, you need to know what it is
[23:41:36] <ms7821> I'd probably assume the 07 65 78 61 at the end is a length followed by the first 3 of 7 characters and this is incomplete
[23:42:50] <tuskkk____> wow, how did you arrive at that?
[23:42:56] <ms7821> practice ;)
[23:42:56] <tuskkk____> the whole thing is here
[23:43:02] <tuskkk____> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/kkFXB2L3/
[23:43:03] <ms7821> is it "examine"?

[23:43:46] <ms7821> oh no, example.com
[23:43:47] <tuskkk____> no, its supposed to be a DNS entry, example.com
[23:43:52] <tuskkk____> wow
[23:44:02] <tuskkk____> can you please tell me how you got that 🙏
[23:44:14] <ms7821> I've seen stuff parse DNS records like this before but I can't remember where
[23:44:32] <tuskkk____> omg
[23:44:48] <ms7821> well, if you look at an ascii chart you can see that lowercase letters are all mapped to 0x61-0x7a
[23:45:06] <ms7821> so if you see some binary data with a bunch of values in that range it's likely to be the text
[23:45:28] <ms7821> it's also very common to store lengths in a byte before a string of characters
[23:46:41] <ms7821> (these are called pascal strings in programming)
[23:48:10] <tuskkk____> just looking at the ascii chart, trying to follow what you wrote above
[23:48:33] <tuskkk____> I forgot how an ascii chart is made, looking it all up, please bear with me
[23:50:01] <sarnold> oh hah if this is decoding dns stuff over the wire..
