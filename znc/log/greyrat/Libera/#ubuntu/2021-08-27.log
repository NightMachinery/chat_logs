[00:09:07] <NGC3982> hi guys.
[00:12:54] <h1pot> hi
[00:13:43] <NGC3982> im having the strangest issue. im in 20.04 with chrome. chrome can't find my samba shares in the save as dialogue. ive had this problem before and then i solved it by some toggle in (what i think was) chrome://flags that enabled chrome to access the drives
[00:14:03] <NGC3982> but i cannot remember what it was, and im unable to understand what the actual problem is
[00:14:31] <sarnold> NGC3982: how did you install chrome?
[00:15:18] <NGC3982> dpkg, afaik
[00:15:27] <Croran> NGC3982: can you just type out the path in your save dialogue?
[00:16:14] <NGC3982> no
[00:18:57] <NGC3982> that was it
[00:19:05] <NGC3982> uninstalled, reinstalled with dpkg, worked
[00:19:07] <NGC3982> thanks

[00:26:52] <sarnold> NGC3982: hmm, so, the chromium-browser .deb package should install the snap package in the postinst script.. and snap has some sandboxing in place that might prevent those things from working. I don't know why uninstalling and reinstalling would fix it though, that doesn't sound quite right..
[00:27:12] <sarnold> NGC3982: but if you've got a chrome package from google, instead, that's probably not snap packaged, and thus not sandboxed by snap :) heh

[02:00:28] <FreeBDSM> hi, I have a newb question. So I have Ubuntu 18.04 and have a program that says that "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found". I see that /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 is a symlink to libm-2.27.so and I probably need libm-2.29.so. Can I just copy that file from a newer ubuntu and temporary change symlink for libm.so.6 to point to that file?

[06:55:33] <spinull> not what i asked
[06:56:04] <tomreyn> you did not actually ask a question anyways ;)
[06:56:23] <spinull> literally 4 lines up
[06:56:27] <spinull> (09:18:31 PM) spinull: wtf is net-tools not installed by default anymore
[06:59:32] <Bashing-om> spinull: The modern replacement for net-tools is iproute2 <- https://www.tecmint.com/deprecated-linux-networking-commands-and-their-replacements/ .
[07:03:36] <spinull> why did they need replacing, everyone knows them and they work well
[07:04:10] <sarnold> they didn't work well, there were loads of networking features that couldn't be reached via those tools
[07:04:11] <leftyfb> spinull: why did they replace steam powered locomotives? Everyone knew them and they worked well
[07:04:22] <sarnold> that's why they were replaced twenty years ago with iproute2 tools
[07:05:55] <spinull> like what/
[07:06:28] <tomreyn> https://lwn.net/Articles/710533/
[07:06:30] <spinull> also, if this is going to be what we have to use now, at least clean up the output, this is ugly af an not easily parsed
[07:06:52] <sarnold> spinull: try ip -c a   etc, that may be easier
[07:07:06] <spinull> thats pretty
[07:07:08] <spinull> ty
[07:07:19] <sarnold> the format's not going to be changed, specifically because loads of people parse these things :)

[13:36:00] <manmohangill> the issue has been around since xorg era
[13:36:10] <alkisg> Yes, but wayland doesn't use xorg
[13:36:16] <manmohangill> what has wayland got to do with this
[13:36:27] <manmohangill> okay so the issue isnt fixed in wayland either
[13:36:32] <alkisg> It needs a different bug report and a different workaround

[14:15:27] <tomreyn> oldgalileo: setting it in sources.list basically just means "hey apt, this is available for this architecture, and this other architecture, too, in case you'll ever need it".
[14:16:46] <tomreyn> oldgalileo: oh you're saying you had "amd64" set on a system that is actually an "arm64" system? and you think ti was still used to find arm64 packages? this seems unlikely to me.
[14:17:27] <tomreyn> more likely this repository was just not taken into account then, because it does not match the host architecture.

[17:24:40] <rbasak> Anyone can contribute a security update to lcov in Bionic. But a correct security update to lcov in Bionic will not be received by a user who has hacked in Focal's version. Yes, it's possible that lcov will receive a major version bump because a security update requires it, and then the update will arrive to such a hacked system, but that's vanishingly unlikely.
[17:25:07] <rbasak> If you want to explain that in full, then feel free.
[17:25:09] <alkisg> In my understanding of human languages, that's a "might", not a "won't".
[17:25:24] <rbasak> No, that's based on your understanding of logic, not human language.
[17:25:37] <alkisg> If there was a wiki page about it, or a factoid, I'd happily link to it, but I don't want to spend the time to write one
[17:26:50] <rbasak> I'm not about to find myself wherever you are to argue this with you in person. However, according to our current understanding of physics there is a miniscule but finite and non-zero probability that it will happen. But in human language, it's an absolute that it won't happen.

[20:21:17] <TJ-> rob: one possibilty is one of those terminals that intercepts pastes and is supposed to display a dialog box and ask for your OK to actually paste. Maybe that is configured but the dialog isn't appearing, or is hidden, or similar?
[20:21:54] <TJ-> rob: which Ubuntu flavour (desktop environment), which release (e.g. 20.04), which terminal emulator?
[20:21:57] <rob> Interesting thought. Not sure what would have brought that on all of a sudden though. No obvious config change.
[20:22:45] <rob> iLinux-OS-User: would you mind repeating your suggestion? I lost those lines with the last freeze.
[20:23:29] <tomreyn> rob: i don't think they made a suggestion. i made this: <tomreyn> rob: run    journalctl -f   in a terminal, then reproduce it, and see what is logged (if anything)

[22:43:43] <TJ-> 15:18 <cjwatson> Unit193: AIUI the rule is now that you have to log in to view pastes that were created by a non-logged-in user.  It's an unfortunately necessary mitigation - we were apparently seeing increasing numbers of takedown notices for illegal material of various kinds.
[22:43:45] <TJ-> 15:19 <cjwatson> Unit193: (The initial plan was to disallow anonymous posting entirely, which I pointed out would be a bit of a problem for pastebinit)

[23:29:09] <chibill[m]> Hi, I am having some issues with PulseAudio on my system, it seems as if PulseAudio is totally broken in some form.
[23:31:22] <Guest4750> what for a version you use?
[23:32:05] <chibill[m]> The output from uname -a says the following, Linux hambook 5.11.0-25-generic #27~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 13 17:41:23 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
[23:32:13] <chibill[m]> Thats how I normally get the version btw

[23:39:07] <chibill[m]> Not the issue, literally PulseAudio is not running because it errors on start.
[23:39:35] <sarnold> ah nice what's the error?
[23:40:04] <ice9> in xorg, gnome settings show 120 hz for the display but in wayland it's just 60 hz, any idea?
[23:40:50] <TJ-> chibill[m]: check the log " journalctl --user -u pulseaudio "
[23:41:27] <TJ-> ice9: Wayland compositor is twice as slow?
[23:41:51] <ice9> TJ-, it's now slow it's running fine but i mean the reported refresh rate
[23:42:15] <TJ-> ice9: I was attempting to crack a joke :)
[23:42:22] <ice9> ah :D
[23:43:07] <TJ-> ice9: I've not touched Wayland compositors so not sure what the equivalent tool to 'xrandr' would be to check on what the displays report over EDID

[23:48:22] <chibill[m]> https://pastebin.com/xBvRgCTr is one of the log entries. Not much in journalctl for pulseaudio. Also using pastebin because I don't have a Ubuntu One account and not sure why its needed not to use the recommend way of sharing logs.

[23:55:22] *** Joins: Warped (~Warped@user/warped)
[23:56:38] <chibill[m]> Yet it can't be accessed by applications / can't see my audio devices. While ALSA can and pusleaudio was also before a reboot about a month ago.
[23:56:51] <sarnold> chibill[m]: the standard journalctl output to a terminal truncates the output :( note the "Possible causes inc>"
[23:57:35] <sarnold> chibill[m]: it's entirely possible that the actual cause is just cut off -- try journalctl -u pulseaudio.service | cat    or | nc termbin.com 9999 or similar

[23:59:11] <sarnold> ah
[23:59:38] <i-garrison> chibill[m]: please check if you can access pulseaudio daemon with 'pactl info' and pastebin the output
[23:59:47] <chibill[m]> I had a better error last time I tried to get help but thats gone. (Expired in paste.ubuntu.com also was before the login change) I stopped looking to a sollution after talking here over an hour and finding out that using ALSA with out pulseaudio involved still worked. Just had to find the correct device name.
