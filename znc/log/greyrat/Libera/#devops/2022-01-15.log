[00:24:34] <slaughter> Just don't manage windows at all, problem double solved
[00:25:20] <slaughter> dan_pena that looks good to me. As long as it works with your tools etc and you're happy with it, ship it!

[00:29:28] <rawtaz> kind of hard to not manage windows when the business software the company needs to use only exists for windows :-)
[00:29:52] <rawtaz> also what other useful domain equivalent to AD is there?
[00:31:40] <slaughter> 1) work at a different company 2) idk I don't work with windows or at the scale required to have to fiddle with things that complex
[00:31:53] <slaughter> You're not wrong rawtaz, I'm just an asshole
[00:32:39] <rawtaz> can we hug now? i cant stand the suspense
[00:33:05] <dan_pena> when you have a 100 lines function it means that I'm doing the code in a bad way xd ?
[00:33:35] <rawtaz> i have small companies as customers and even they use software that they need to use and using another one wont remove the windows requirement, theres also one that needs to run on mac.
[00:33:49] <rawtaz> dan_pena: yeah, generally speaking thats a bit too long indeed
[00:34:03] <rawtaz> try splitting it up into parts that make sense
[00:34:16] <slaughter> Yes a 100 line function is at the very least a code smell and most likely you'll regret it later if you don't fix it now

[00:42:04] <rawtaz> i would love to not have to deal with windows, but it is what it is. one has to realize that there's a reality out there, which is separate from ideals and what's right and proper :)

[00:53:59] <rawtaz> you the company needs software with features X, and the only software with that exists for windows, what else are you supposed to do?
[00:54:53] <slaughter> Oh they should use whatever they need to get the job done for sure
