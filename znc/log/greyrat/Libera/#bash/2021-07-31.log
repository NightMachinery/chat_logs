[01:10:06] <greybot> The backquote (`) is used in the old-style command substitution, e.g. foo=`command`. The foo=$(command) syntax is recommended instead. Backslash handling inside $() is less surprising, and $() is easier to nest. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082

[01:31:43] <twkm> if your script is to be portable keep in mind that that file doesn't always have all groups and thus not all users of all groups.
[01:32:16] <emanuele6> on UNIX systems, you can use id(1) to get the GID or group name of the effective group given a username or UID 
[01:32:46] <emanuele6> group_id=$(id -g "$username") group_name=$(id -ng "$username")
[01:33:08] <twkm> not useful to do something applied to every member of a group.
[01:33:47] <emanuele6> oh, i thought he meant "given a user, can i get its group?"

[03:04:29] <pyzozord> the @Q doesn't seem to work. I am getting gio: file://[...]/'File%20Wiht%20Spaces.pdf': [...] No such file

[03:05:11] <twkm> oh well.  back to xdg-open sucks, i guess.
[03:05:26] <emg> yeah I gave up on xdg-open 10-15 years ago, never missed it
[03:06:01] <pyzozord> any better ideas how to open fiels and directories from cli?
[03:06:28] <emg> use the command you want to use
[03:06:40] <emg> instead of having xdg-open guess for you
[03:07:26] <pyzozord> hmm, never thought of that. I'd need to figure out what is the command for my file explorer and pdf reader mostly. I use mpv for media, so that I already invoke directly via cli
[03:07:46] <emg> e.g. I use mupdf for pdfs so I would:    mupdf File\ With\ Spaces.pdf
[03:08:09] <twkm> there's an xdg command for that, so you might use that to build the command yourself.
[03:08:18] <emg> also give up on file explorers, use the shell and tools! :-D
[03:09:21] <pyzozord> true, sometimes it's just convenient to interactively explore the directory tree without typing commands
[03:09:47] <pyzozord> I should install like some kind of mc type tool maybe

[09:54:09] <rtn0> hi agn. 
[09:54:36] <rtn0> i have learned how to open arbitrary .vtt files whenever launching mpv to watch an individual video... but...
[09:54:44] <rtn0> ...it makes use of the --list
[09:55:00] <rtn0> ...oops, typo. it makes use of mpv --sub-file "blah.en.vtt"
[09:55:20] <rtn0> ...it's a nice short term solution, but...
[09:55:30] <rtn0> ...what i'd *really* like is to find a way to make mpv use a particular different default setting.
[09:55:41] <rtn0> such as ignoring the "cunt tree" code, and just opening the very first matching filename with .vtt that it finds within the same dir, or soemthing similar.
[09:55:48] *** Joins: mongrel (uid508343@id-508343.charlton.irccloud.com)
[09:56:08] <rtn0> gnome saiyan? lemme know if anyone has any ideas about how i might solve this. thx in advance. :D
[09:56:12] <phy1729> Sounds like you need to be asking mpv people not bash people
[09:56:22] <rtn0> note: i read about in the manpage about something called "fuzzy matching"
[09:56:30] <rtn0> if i can find a way to make this work, it would be a blessing, cuz right now the way im doing it is inefficient (beign forced to, by hand, launch individual videos, and tell it to use the matching filename.en.vtt
[09:56:42] <rtn0> )
[09:56:49] <phy1729> #mpv exists
[09:56:52] <rtn0> it would be much more correct and efficient to be able to mass open files using wildcards (*, etc) and/or open large number of highlighted files within mc (Midnight Commander).
[09:56:56] <rtn0> phy1729: yes i know
[09:57:06] <rtn0> phy1729: i asked on #youtube-dl and #mpv
[09:57:16] <rtn0> phy1729: the ppl on both channels were very helpful
[09:57:20] <phy1729> so you're doing mpv foo.xyz --abc foo.en.vtt ?
[09:57:31] <rtn0> but i was still left with a few unanswered qs
[09:58:01] <rtn0> errrr
[09:58:15] <rtn0> yes
[09:58:18] <rtn0> exactly
[09:58:45] <rtn0> mpv --sub-file myfilename.en.vtt myfilename.mp4
[09:58:46] <phy1729> if so I assume you want something like      foo() { for f; do mpv "$f" --abc "${f%.xyz}.en.vtt"; done; }
[09:59:01] <rtn0> but if i have a huge dir with 100 vids in it, i do NOT wanna type that 100 times
[09:59:17] <phy1729> foo() { for f; do mpv --sub-file "${f%.mp4}.en.vtt" "$f"; done; }
[09:59:20] <rtn0> i wanna go mpv *, and be done with it
[09:59:22] <phy1729> foo *.mp4
[09:59:36] <rtn0> yes, that's what i'd like to do, *.mp4 or something similarly elegant
[09:59:43] <rtn0> to save me keystrokes and headaches
[10:00:08] <rtn0> but by default, if i do that, it ignores all the .en.vtt files, and i therefore cannot use the subtitles
[10:00:21] <phy1729> The two lines work together
[10:00:25] <rtn0> cuz by default it expects only .vtt (without cunttree codes)
[10:00:43] <rtn0> oh, that's a script
[10:00:47] <rtn0> *doh*
[10:00:49] <rtn0> gotcha
[10:01:18] <rtn0> shit, that was fast, my friend
[10:02:12] <rtn0> so the above code will, for every file with an .mp4 extension, use the file with the same name but with the ".en.vtt" extension immediately after the --sub-file flag, correct?
[10:02:22] <phy1729> yes
[10:02:41] <rtn0> awesome. thx. imma try it now...
[10:02:45] <rtn0> brb
[10:03:19] <phy1729> So next time ask along the lines of      I have a folder of .mp4 and .en.vtt files and want a function I can call with the .mp4 file and it will use the corresponding .en.vtt file like this    mpv --sub-file foo.en.vtt foo.mp4

[10:11:53] <rtn0> oops
[10:12:01] <rtn0> i meant to say...
[10:12:04] <rtn0> i put:
[10:12:10] <rtn0> foo() { for f; do mpv --sub-file "${f%.mp4}.en.vtt" "$f"; done; }
[10:12:15] <rtn0> foo *.mp4
[10:12:22] <rtn0> inside of a file.
[10:12:36] <rtn0> and then launched it with the . symbol in front of the filename.
[10:13:03] <rtn0> i suppose it could create an alias with all this in it, right?
[10:13:20] <rtn0> and then include that alias inside of the configuration file for bash?
[10:13:26] <rtn0> or am i talking like an idiot?

[10:25:42] <rtn0> s/alias/configfile
[10:25:47] <phy1729> Just define the function in your .bashrc
[10:26:17] <rtn0> oh. i have no idea how to define functions in my .bashrc file. i have highly customized it, but entirely using aliases.
[10:26:50] <rtn0> i hope aliases are not Considered Harmful?
[10:26:53] <rtn0> like gotos?

See <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles>. For GUI logins, SEE YOUR DOCUMENTATION or ask your OS channel because they're all different and we don't know.
[10:30:56] <rtn0> but to "call" the function, i would type simply "foo *.mp4"?
