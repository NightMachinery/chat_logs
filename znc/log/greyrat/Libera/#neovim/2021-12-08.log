[01:35:30] <ChrisKipp[m]> Also is it not really recommend to use it then in LSP requests from a server that need a return value?

[14:25:29] <suy|m> I'm looking about moving my setup from using vim-pathogen for setting the runtimepath to the native package system. However, I'm confused by the directory just below `pack`. What's the point of having more than one directory under `pack`, if then under it you will have many directories under `start` or `opt`?
[14:26:18] <suy|m> IOW, why `pack/*/start/*` instead of just `pack/start/*`? What's the use case?
[14:28:23] <clason[m]> The original idea was to have a top-level directory for each package (which may contain `start` and `opt` parts), I believe
[14:28:33] <clason[m]> This wasn't really taken up
[14:29:12] <clason[m]> so instead of `pack/foo/start/<plugin>/` you'd have `pack/<plugin>/start`
[14:29:35] <clason[m]> but as always with such things: you'd have to ask Bram.
[14:32:30] <suy|m> OK ‚òπÔ∏è  And nowadays, how are people using the feature? Do they just toss everything under `pack/some-name/start`? Or anyone can think of some use of having more than one dir?

[14:35:17] <clason[m]> People just use packer
[14:35:33] <suy|m> Ah, no, wait, I think I've found the reason... It's just that plugins don't typically(?) put their stuff under `start` and `opt`. But if they did, you could clone there repos direcly under `pack`
[14:35:52] <clason[m]> Yes, as I said, that was never taken up
[14:36:00] <clason[m]> (lack of backward compatibility, I'm sure)
[14:36:05] <suy|m> OK, sorry, I did not get what you meant üôÇ
[14:36:29] <suy|m> Silly me, now I see it. Thank you!
[14:37:12] <monkoosemonkoose> I think majority still using some plugin managers like vim-plug or packer
[14:38:55] <suy|m> Yes, this seems the case given what I found in docs of most plugins. I prefer to keep stuff under git submodules and no manager.

[15:42:49] <clason[m]> I don't think that issue has to do with ordering per se; it's just that neovide gets confused and applies the blur to the wrong floats
[15:43:22] <LoipesMas[m]> clason: what do you mean?
[15:44:07] <LoipesMas[m]> It's not only an issue of blurring. Without blur and transparency some things are just hidden behind other windows.
[15:45:21] <clason[m]> I don't see that (at least on main); I've only ever noticed problems with `--multigrid` enabled, where blur is incorrectly applied

[17:37:28] <grazfather[m]> hey guys. I use a plugin that uses `vim.api.nvim_feedkeys`, and it ends with an `a` to enter insert mode. But when I bind something to that function + extra characters those characters are not entered as if in insert mode, and instead insert mode is entered after the whole binding runs. What's going on here?
[17:37:43] <clason[m]> you need information from outside the file
[17:37:46] <flupe> yes
[17:37:51] <clason[m]> no, that is currently not possible with treesitter
[17:38:08] <flupe> yes, hence why i want my custom lsp to produce the treesitter ast used by neovim
[17:38:20] <flupe> because my lsp has the info needed, and can parse correctly
[17:38:31] <clason[m]> that is correct
[17:38:42] <sunjonSenghanBri> is the question: "can LSP results populate a TS AST, if the parts that can't be built in TS because of multi-file context, are supplemented from the LS"
[17:38:42] <clason[m]> that is not correct, IIUC
[17:38:54] <sunjonSenghanBri> what do you get from that? aside from the "you can now use the same keybindings"

[17:39:16] <clason[m]> the treesitter API is one-way: you can query the tree, but you cannot modify the tree (directly)
[17:39:46] <flupe> oh
[17:39:56] <flupe> even if i just want to set the *entire* tree?
[17:40:05] <clason[m]> you can augment the parser by a custom scanner you write yourself in C
[17:40:29] <clason[m]> some parsers (like markdown?) do that, I believe
[17:40:30] <flupe> sunjonSenghanBri: well structured queries is one thing, the other is proper highlighting
[17:40:52] <sunjonSenghanBri> LSPs can provide the highlighting as is, no?

[17:41:57] <flupe> well thanks for the info :)
[17:43:06] <clason[m]> you might hack it via `LanguageTree:trees()` (if that returns a handle to an object that you can replace with your own)

[17:51:14] <flupe> i'm thinking about dependtly-typed PL/proof assistants where user-defined notation is everywhere
[17:51:41] <flupe> well those typically do not have LSPs and only work in a single editor, but the trend is slowly changing
[17:53:01] <flupe> clason[m]: I think I would just be happy with a TS function allowing me to replace the full tree on the neovim side
[17:53:33] <flupe> retrieving the AST from my LSP could be a completelemy custom LSP extension in a plugin
[17:53:57] <flupe> (that does not have to be supported by anyone other than the plugin and LSP for this lang)
[17:56:22] <clason[m]> that wouldn't be a ts function ;)
[17:56:49] <flupe> in the neovim API?
[17:58:12] <clason[m]> the trick is to keep the tree in sync with changes at all times
[17:59:15] <clason[m]> no, that's your problem then ;)
[17:59:38] <clason[m]> neovim itself uses tree-sitter to do exactly that
[18:00:18] <clason[m]> if you bypass that, you're on your own ;) (even if there's a hook for setting the current tree(s), which there is not currently)
[18:00:55] <flupe> oh yes, I understand it would my responsibility to keep the tree up to date haha
[18:01:18] <flupe> the only thing missing is a way to give the full tree to neovim and say "please trust me use this"

[18:24:50] <clason[m]> but I guess

[19:32:41] <sunjonSenghanBri> the "it starts linting my current file, and displaying messages in the middle of my code, which is really annoying" / "make the lsp server stop linting all over my face" comments read as: 'the defaults are confusing and in my face'. LSP + builtin diagnostics are a really nice feature, and extremely configurable. If there is an LSP backed diagnostics - most people use it

[22:02:54] <mahdi[m]1> p00f: I've just swapped ccls with clangd and it's working now as expected. Thanks fred
[22:03:10] <bananajoe> Bowuigi[m] I'm not sure it's related to which-key, it shouldn't have anything to do with lsp
[22:03:31] <bananajoe> which-key works but I just see that message non-stop over it

[22:04:29] <kylo252[m]> bluemonksr[m]: yeah, it has a very good foundation from `cquery`  
[22:04:30] <kylo252[m]> I just wish they would implement call-hierarchy according to the official specs
[22:05:21] <Bowuigi[m]> bananajoe: Ah, then some plugin (most likely the statusline) is calling get_count, which is deprecated
[22:05:40] <Bowuigi[m]> Which statusline are you using?
[22:06:03] <kylo252[m]> bananajoe: which status-line plugin are you using? it's probably the culprit here

[22:11:45] <bananajoe> You are right, thank you. I'll look for an alternative.
[22:12:17] <Bowuigi[m]> Hmmmm do you have an lsp module active on it? That might be the issue
[22:12:25] <p00f> lualine is maintained tho
[22:12:44] <Bowuigi[m]> I don't use a statusline plugin (made one myself), so no idea tbh
[22:13:08] <p00f> just grep for get_count in your plugin directory
[22:13:49] <Bowuigi[m]> Yeah that would be better

[22:23:57] <bananajoe> Thanks everyone. I just switched the content of the section lualine_b to ignore diagnostics.
