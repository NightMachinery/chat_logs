[00:40:12] <hexnewbie> My server root disks don't see any use at all, I almost feel guilty when the disks take up bays
[00:40:47] <hexnewbie> They usually do have internal SAS/SATA ports, but those can't be replaced online.
[00:40:52] <Dagmar> Those cards might run out of writes in like, 2036
[00:41:38] <koollman> ncuxo: it's not awful. maybe it can be useful it you do it to free up some other ports for data/services. I would still prefer having at least one internal disk. You could also consider having two usb disks in raid
[00:41:48] <koollman> I'm not sure it's a good idea, though
[00:41:54] <DLange> the bad thing about sdcards is ... they have no error management. Writes fail silently.

Sure, sd cards are cheaper. But those disks last for a while, and human

[00:59:45] <Dagmar> A /10 is a rather _vast_ number of addresses

[01:01:21] <Dagmar> I hope
[01:01:26] <zetaE> the problem is the router only having 1.1

[01:52:26] <Dagmar> zetaE: WHen it _does_ find a match, assuming there's a gateway address specified for that route entry, it hands those packets to the gateway host
[01:52:59] <Dagmar> If there's _no_ gateway specified, it's assumed that that IP address is in the local broadcast domain, i.e., it can talk _directly_ to that host, so it goes straight to ARP at that point

[02:07:39] <Dagmar> Do you _have_ giant messages there?
[02:07:50] <Dagmar> Bandwidth is not the same thing as latency
[02:08:14] <hexnewbie> Depends on how small your source code files are, if the developer put half a function in a file, the latency might matter more. If the developer thought to include the *entire* source inside a single file and run one gcc instance... well, no latency problem, but also no gain from making it distributed
[02:08:26] <catbeard> bandwidth is a function of RTT, ergo latency
[02:09:04] <Dagmar> Most people are using NFS so everytthing's got access to the source, last time I checked

[02:12:06] <hexnewbie> rascul: You'd need to split it into several functions. Though nothing stops you from using #include in the middle of a function, but that will not affect compilation, as the compiler will still work on the entire source

[02:18:57] <digital_mystik> hello.. total rsync noobie, but how can I update destination files from changed source files? I have tried the checksum flag and have noticed some config files were not updated that have changed in the source (comp to external drive for backup). if there are minor changes, is rsync able to pick that up?
[02:19:20] <lotharn> how can i call openvpn to set it's route metric higher?
[02:19:32] <Dagmar> digital_mystik: It can, but by _default_ it does _not_ do checksums.  It only looks at mtimes and file length
[02:20:03] <Dagmar> digital_mystik: If you've got things which are making changes to files but fudging the timestamps, then you have to tell it to use checksums (which is slower but will at least find the differences for sure)
[02:20:22] <hexnewbie> I'm not sure why people go to such lengths to create havoc. All you need to do is not check the return value of a function. My favourite infinite loop eating 100% CPU is â€˜while (!feof($f)) { ... }â€™, where $f failed to open, so feof fails every time. And I've seen someone rig that into a piece of code that filled 1 GiB of a database a second.
[02:20:44] <Dagmar> Note that if vfat is involved, generally you have to use checksums, because vfat's timestamps won't match up with ext3/4's timestamps (vfat is missing one)
[02:20:52] <rbox> hexnewbie: i hate when people don't check the resturn value of printf!
[02:21:31] <Dagmar> hexnewbie: I've seen bigger messes.  The thing that was causing flaming computers to fall from the sky was a PHP script someone had written as if they were doing a bodge job of COBOL
[02:21:35] <digital_mystik> hmm.. yeah initially I used grsync with the default settings (no checksum enabled), so maybe that is why it is not changing the destination files with checksum now since they are "newer" or something?

[03:02:58] <CrtxReavr> eharmonic, it's a specific purpose. . . not for shits & giggles.
[03:03:32] <eharmonic> what do you want to do - there probably are easier methods - this is linux :)
[03:03:49] <Dagmar> So basically it's probably complaining because it can't modify a rule that already exists

[04:09:09] <Guest84> not always be the same set, may not be the same device, or the set may grow and shrink, so it would be optimal to be able to say dynamically limit based on flows to or from a device.Â  i'm thinking of identifying a "device here" by using iptables CONNMARK to flag packets per device into a unique fwmark

[08:08:36] <euouae> cornfeedhobo I think what they do is just make sure they work for windows

[09:01:24] <Lebela> sorry
[09:01:25] <kurahaupo> I would love to see a legal precedent that the govt can ask you to unlock your device, but if they take possession of an unlocked device without a court warrant, that automatically poisons any evidence obtained from it
[09:01:26] <Lebela> re
[09:02:00] <Lebela> What is the most reasonable way to compare if 2 directories, both containing MP4 videos, are identical?
[09:02:09] <Lebela> currently I am using "diff -r"  but it takes forever
[09:02:12] <kurahaupo> Dagmar: the obvious motive is "get money"
[09:02:17] <Lebela> md5sums also take very, very long
[09:02:28] <Dagmar> kurahaupo: They can ask--and you're mad if you consent--but every time those land in front of a judge later the people asking improperly get scolded
[09:02:43] <Lebela> context: I copied the files from my phone to my external HD and I want to be sure they're okay before I delete from from my phone
[09:03:11] <Dagmar> Lebela: If you want a _meaningful_ comparison then you are just going to have to deal with the fact that it'll be slow
[09:03:21] <kurahaupo> Lebela: it should take as long to compare as it did to make the copy originally. If it takes less time then the copy is broken anyway
[09:03:27] <euouae> Lebela use md5sum in conjuction with head -c 1024
[09:03:30] <Lebela> Dagmar, that's why I said "reasonable"

[09:04:14] <euouae> are you testing for integrity or duplicity?
[09:04:27] <Dagmar> If you want a _real_ comparison, use rsync with the --checksum option
[09:04:56] <Dagmar> If you used sha256 it would likely be faster, but mainly because CPUs have accelleration for that now
[09:05:22] <kurahaupo> doesn't rsync do checksumming by default, unless it can prove that the 2 files differ (such as having different lengths)
[09:05:25] <Lebela> I am currently using rsync like this:
[09:05:27] <Lebela> if rsync -avP --info=progress2 "${1}" "${2}"; then
[09:05:47] <Lebela> if I addedd --checksum  (as per Dagmar's suggestion) it would solve it?
[09:05:57] <tirnanog> kurahaupo: no, it doesn't.
[09:06:00] <Dagmar> kurahaupo: No, it actually just goes on m/ctime and file length and considers those to be good enough
[09:06:09] <euouae> You can e.g. use https://github.com/pkolaczk/fclones
[09:06:19] <Dagmar> ...which is where people get into trouble with vfat, since it's missing one and they'll never match up

[09:07:19] <ayecee> worse. they sometimes match up.
[09:07:29] <auk> Lebela, add --checksum to rsync and you should have a meaningful comparison, I think. It will take a while, but that's a good thing
[09:07:50] <Lebela> auk, will that also work if I have to resume the process?

[09:08:02] <Lebela> auk, because my rsync often "dies off" while copying from the phone
[09:08:08] <Dagmar> Lebela: It's goign to start the comparisons over
[09:08:13] <auk> Lebela, it should yes.
[09:08:16] <auk> yeah it will start over
[09:08:21] <Lebela> rsync: [sender] send_files failed to open "/mnt/camera/store_00010001/DCIM/Camera/foo.mp4": Input/output error (5)
[09:08:36] <Lebela> ^ this is what happens to me after a while,  as the phone somehow "dies off" while copying
[09:08:36] <auk> what i'd recommend is do rsync without checksums a bunch of times, as many times as it takes to complete the copy
[09:08:38] <Dagmar> Lebela: For those I usually just use MTP
[09:08:43] <Lebela> Dagmar, me too
[09:08:51] <auk> and then after rsync comletes the copy, run --checksum one time
[09:08:52] <Dagmar> It's not the fastest thing but there's less buggery involved
[09:08:54] <vdamewood> Dagmar: I'm guessing the rsyinc problem isn't a problem with NTFS.
[09:08:55] <kurahaupo> Lebela: break it up into smaller batches, so you only have to restart a batch, not the whole thing
[09:09:00] <tirnanog> it's not that vfat misses a modification time. rather, that the resolution is so coarse (second resolution only). -@1 suffices as a workaround in practice. I use that a lot in syncing things to my sd cards.
[09:09:04] <Lebela> and I mount my phone like this:  "sudo gphotofs /mnt/phone"

[09:09:37] <Lebela> is there actually an option to make "rsync" behave like "cp" when it comes to directory creation?
[09:09:38] <kurahaupo> tirnanog: actually the resolution of times in vfat is *two* seconds
[09:09:55] <Dagmar> Huh?
[09:10:00] <tirnanog> kurahaupo: I sit corrected. still, the above workaround seems to work well enough.
[09:10:04] <auk> Lebela, if you want to speed up subsequent comparisons, you can also store a db of hashes, so that way you'll only have to checksum one set of files (rsync --checksum will checksum boths sides, and it starts over if it fails)

[09:13:17] <Dagmar> Lebela: cp isn't naturally recursive until you tell it to be.  rsync is _always_ recursive
[09:13:46] <Dagmar> So... if you tell it 'foo' and 'foo' is a directory it'll copy that directory.
[09:13:57] <Dagmar> If you tell it 'foo/' it'll start with _the contents_ of that directory
[09:14:15] <Dagmar> ...and a similar thing happens with destinations.
[09:15:06] <tirnanog> it must be told to recurse, just as cp must be. -r or -a.

[09:18:43] <kurahaupo> Lebela: rsync is only interested in transferring files. Directories are a necessary evil to get the same path on both ends, not something that itself needs to be copied.

[09:20:09] <Dagmar> Sometimes it will try to copy contexts by removing them all from the destination, which the kernel isn't really guaranteed to tolerate and _still allow you to write anything_
[09:21:03] <kurahaupo> Lebela: more like destination=${2%/}
[09:21:08] <Dagmar> My rsync driven near-line backups all get an /.autorelabel added to them by default for much that reason
[09:21:14] <tirnanog> Lebela: where an operand ends with "/", imagine that it's "/." in the case of rsync. that makes it more comparable to the behaviour of cp under the same circumstances.

[09:34:46] <Lebela> auk, I installed "Syncthing",  and I could totally read a manual, but maybe you can sum it up in a sentence?
[09:34:50] <tirnanog> I mean, arbitrarily stripping a trailing slash from the destination operand already makes it wholly unsuitable as a would-be work-a-like.

[09:38:31] <auk> so it will allow outside connectins to its port, but it authenticates and only allows connections from your other syncthing clients (or your friends syncthing clients, if you choose to scan a QR code from them and sync a folder or two with them)

[09:40:11] <Lebela> sorry for being so dumbstuck, but what is the "Device ID" ?
[09:40:27] <auk> it has a global discovery server that allows NAT traversal. The discovery server just puts the two IPs in contact, all data traffic goes encrypted p2p between your endpoints. But if both your computers are on the same wifi, it will default to connecting them locally
[09:40:28] <Lebela> when adding a new device, I am supposed to provide a "Device ID" but there is nothing in my phone's "About Phone" page
[09:41:01] <auk> easiest is to pull up the device ID on your computer
[09:41:11] <Lebela> how?
[09:41:16] <auk> Actions->show ID
[09:41:27] <auk> then scan that QR using your phone
[09:41:48] <Lebela> where should I click on "Actions" ?

[09:42:37] <auk> np
[09:42:42] <Lebela> so, I enter my _computer_'s  ID when I add a new PHONE ?
[09:42:47] <Lebela> that makes zero sense, but oK, I do it
[09:43:12] <auk> each device has an ID. You're just linking the two devices (computer, phone) together
[09:43:18] <Lebela> Error: "A device with that ID is already added."
[09:43:28] <auk> you can do it either direction, but the phone has a camera so it's easir to scan

[13:18:29] <jaggz> not sure how you expect a tool to automatically "merge" when files can conflict in name and folder
[13:18:46] <roboirc> np will figure it out
[13:18:48] <hexnewbie> The copying over needs to happen from Windows, as NTFS-3G (or worse, the new buggy ntfs3 driver) would lose most metadata if you copied using them
[13:18:58] <jaggz> "Error, c:\foo.txt exists in both filesystems, would you like to: ...."
[13:19:12] <jaggz> hexnewbie, good to know
[13:19:30] <SpiceMan> roboirc: you can 1) move all the data from NTFS partition 2 to NTFS partition 1. 2) delete NTFS partition 2. 3) move the ext4 partition to the end of the new free space. 4) resize the NTFS partition

[17:29:39] <koollman> and I ended up parallelizing it but mostly by having 'quick' tests run on other machines, while the 'long' test are still long and on a single node, because splitting dict or hash lose some of the interesting part of the attacks I use (like combining words from the dict or using the usernames in the attacks)

[18:12:15] <koollman> analoq: because not salting is even worse :)
[18:12:20] <ananke> libc: did you let rsync finish?
[18:12:31] <libc> yes it's just a bunch of config files
[18:12:40] <koollman> analoq: imagine now you have 10 millions of hashes, no salt used. sort them. any duplicate indicate common passwords :)
[18:12:52] <ananke> libc: reason I ask is because I think the default is to 'delete after', rather than 'delete during'
[18:13:20] <analoq> koollman: wouldnt that work with a salt too?
[18:13:43] <koollman> analoq: but it is worse. if you prefer, it is like trying to find the salt, but the salt length is 0 ;)
[18:13:45] <analoq> sha(same_pw+same_salt) should always give the same hash, or not?

[18:15:53] <libc> rsync -aAX --relative --delete-excluded
[18:15:55] <koollman> analoq: there are 3 general kinds of salt usages, based on wether it is stored with the hash or not, and unique or not. (well, 4, but not unique and stored is really even dumber :) ). typically, it is stored and unique. something like this: $mysalt$myhash , would be pretty typical storage

[18:16:30] <koollman> analoq: it can also be unique, and not stored, so you have to guess it (but you can see duplicates in the hashes so there are weaknesses and known-passwords attacks on that)
[18:16:49] <libc> i remove the files that i want to delete from my rsync command and i hoped it would delete them thanks for the --delete-excluded
[18:17:20] <koollman> analoq: or it can be different for each entry and not stored, but then you need to find a way to get the salt that was not stored, so it is usually derived from some other property of the entry (like 'sha1(username)')
[18:18:24] *** Joins: [twisti] (~twisti@toadwater.com)
[18:18:40] <koollman> analoq: the last kind is the worst to try and crack, but it's not common. fixed salt is a bit more complex than no salt, but it's really not good anymore. And you are much more likely to encounted salt+hash stored together (but salt unique to each entry, so you cannot quickly find duplicates)
[18:18:48] <analoq> koollman: i see. didnt expect the salt would be stored with the pw. I assumed there would be a login handler which knows the salt and a separate db, which stores the hash vals
[18:19:02] <koollman> analoq: it would have to be as secure as the other one :)

[20:26:24] <djph> grodzio: format and use a linux native filesystem, I guess.
[20:26:39] <grodzio> but i've had some files in there
[20:26:48] <grodzio> nothing too important but it would take time to redownload

[20:28:34] <djph> well, guess you have to re-download things.  Unless there's some newer tool that'll fix NTFS under linux (which, lets face it, even if there is, you still have a decent chance of irrevocable corruption because of NTFS in the first place)
[20:28:42] <ananke> grodzio: you may want to check 'dmesg' output, see if it shows anything more.
[20:29:03] <ananke> grodzio: right now I'd focus on identifying whether that's a hardware failure, or filesystem consistency one

[20:31:25] <ananke> usr123: I'm sure there is
[20:31:41] <moo> there is "always free tier" at amazon, google and oracle but not sure if they want CC
[20:32:03] <djph> grodzio: well, if dmesg shows no errors, then the good news is that it's more likely just a broken filesystem.  Use Windows to repair it.
[20:32:08] <ananke> grodzio: that's both good and bad. no hardware errors in dmesg is good news, but I would expect something being logged about your mount attempt

[20:33:26] <ananke> grodzio: it's possible that the filesystem was already corrupted when you were dumping data to it, and it got worse because of it. windows is best option now

[20:33:58] <grodzio> ananke: what about running ntfsfix first and then using windows if that fails? can ntfsfix make things worse?
[20:34:05] <djph> significantly
[20:34:14] <Psi-Jack> DO, using their DNS, is the worst. You can't organize it at all.
[20:34:21] <ananke> grodzio: if you're concerned, make a backup. (image based backup, not file based)
