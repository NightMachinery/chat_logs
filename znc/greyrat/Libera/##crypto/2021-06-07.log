[19:51:56] <ioxzev1z> "cipher TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (256 bits)" why 384 bit sha rather than 256? This is for libera
[19:53:42] <woggle> ioxzev1z: SHA-256 is generally considered to have a security level more similar to AES-128 than AES-256 (or AES-192).
[19:54:17] <woggle> ioxzev1z: (Based on estimates of the computational difficulty of carrying out brute-force-like attacks.)
[19:54:22] <ioxzev1z> So 384 is closer to 192?
[19:54:43] <bw> jbis: no idea
[19:55:05] <bw> (i'm not a cryptographer)
[19:55:05] <woggle> ioxzev1z: Yeah, https://www.keylength.com/ (one of the resources linked off the topic) gives some sources.
[19:55:15] <ioxzev1z> Thanks
[19:56:12] <ioxzev1z> woggle, but using sha-384 as a key to aes-256 is just cutting off 128 bits?
[19:58:03] <woggle> ioxzev1z: TLS uses the hash function more than deriving a single symmetric key.
[20:00:28] <ioxzev1z> woggle, what do you mean? Doesn't that cipher line imply that 256 bits of a sha-384 hash are used as a key to aes-gcm?

[20:12:31] <woggle> ioxzev1z: It's true that the last step in in TLS's key derivation function is taking the output of a cryptographic hash function, and that in the case where the symmetric key in question in 256 bits and the hash output is 384 bits, it will be truncated. But TLS's key derivation function uses the hash itself multiple times (to support getting different keys for different purposes and because it's a
[20:12:33] <woggle> generic construction that supports generating arbitrarily long keys). Also, TLS uses the cryptographic hash for some things which aren't directly related to key derivation, like choosing what to sign in certification verification.
[20:13:32] <ioxzev1z> Ah, thanks
[20:16:21] <ioxzev1z> So it's fine to truncate a hash for key generation? Or would you sha256(sha384(x)) ?
[20:17:39] <woggle> Something's really wrong with your cryptographic hash if truncating its output to length X is worse than using a good cryptographic hash of length X.
[20:19:06] <woggle> If you're doing a real protocol, I advise extreme caution as there are a lot of things to get wrong, but generally, like TLS, you're likely to want a key derivation function that's parameterized by some sort of "purpose" or "salt" field so you derive multiple keys for different parts of your protocol.
[20:19:41] <woggle> TLS 1.3 uses https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5869 specifically.
[20:19:46] <ioxzev1z> I'm not designing anything, just read the cipher line on irc connect
[20:25:38] <Alipha> ioxzev1z: truncating is fine. and as an unintentional effect (generally), it actually prevents length extension attacks (where relevant. length-extension attacks probably aren't a concern in tls). e.g., SHA512/256 (SHA512, then truncated to 256 bits) is not vulnerable to length extension, while SHA256 is
[20:26:08] <ioxzev1z> Ah
