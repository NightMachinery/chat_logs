[00:27:29] <offby1> I have what might be an unusual situation, or might not be; I'd love to find a blog post or something where someone else talks about how they handled it.  Namely: my company is using some third-party code that isn't public (although it lives in github), and we want to bring that into our repository ... but our security policies prohibit commits whose authors aren't in my company.  So I'll probably be periodically fetching their stuff from
[00:27:29] <offby1> github, then committing those files,  in a single commit with my name on it, and a comment like "this is from https://github.com/third-party-co/project/commit/deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef" or something.  This will work, I guess, but seems messy.   I'd love to see how someone else has handled this situation.

And "responsible for" here goes along with "our engineer's names are on the commits" (I am expected to vouch for this code as if it were my own, and that doesn't seem unreasonable; it's not too complex)

[01:41:06] <ikke> It depends a bit on your situation

[19:56:48] <j416> schuelermine[m]: remember that rebase works just on your one branch, so as long as you have everything committed (which you should), you can easily reset to the state before the rebase in case you screw it up

[19:59:15] <j416> I think it'd be confusing; if you know your way around, undo is easy
[19:59:47] <j416> adding another layer on top of that (with an undo command that would do different things depending on what you did last) would lead to a lot of confusion, I think
[19:59:49] <schuelermine[m]> if you know your way around, you can just not use it
[20:00:27] <schuelermine[m]> it could be super simple, just recording the command you last typed and nothing else
[20:00:49] <schuelermine[m]> I don’t see who it would confuse
[20:01:25] <schuelermine[m]> Most commands are sensitive to other things than the state of the repo anyways (current branch), and a lot of commands enter special modes that completely change their behaviour

[20:05:41] <gitinfo> the git-worktree manpage is available at https://gitirc.eu/git-worktree.html
[20:06:12] <schuelermine[m]> j416: No, that does not work
[20:06:36] <schuelermine[m]> Two worktrees cannot be checked out at the same place, because edits might conflict
[20:07:31] <schuelermine[m]> Because of this, I want a read-only window, where I don’t need an extra branch (which makes going back difficult w/o changing things elsewhere), and can be up-to-date with the main directory if I need to
[20:08:02] <schuelermine[m]> Although, I find the reasoning for not being on the same branch a bit ridiculous

[20:15:29] <schuelermine[m]> It’s said that a problem would occur if I commit a change from v1 to v2 in worktree 1, and then commit a change from v1 to v3 in worktree 2, it would get out of sync.
[20:15:29] <schuelermine[m]> IMO what should happen is that the second commit should just be a commit from v2 to v3, but, since the checked-out files are (mostly) the ones from v1, the result is a different diff but with the same content as the second commit in isolation.
[20:16:35] <schuelermine[m]> i.e. if I commit in worktree 1, while worktree 2 is checked out to the same branch, it should checkout to the new commit in worktree 2 without changing the files, like running git-restore afterwards.

[22:49:43] <tylee> Hello. How to supress that 'default branch name' rant when I do git init? Really don't like such multiline political info messages when I don't need them. 2>/dev/null is an option but you know, not the best. Even with 2>/dev/null it prints useless information, even if it goes to devnull
[22:50:39] <DoofusCanadensis> i believe it tells you how to disable that right in that message

[22:51:35] <DoofusCanadensis> yes that message tells you exactly how to disable it
[22:53:02] <tylee> yes, but I have many machines with various configs. Reconfigure every of them is unneccesary time spend. And till I use scripts to do what I want it'll be nice to have an arg to fix it.

I'm not an american so your political disputes aren't for me. and usually on my machines I don't want to see anything that I didn't ask for. Like, you know, when I want to listen some political rant from developers, I subscribe to Patreon or join irc channel.
