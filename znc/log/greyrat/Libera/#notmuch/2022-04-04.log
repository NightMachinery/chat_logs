[05:13:07] <rlb> bremner, madduck: fwiw, I just recently started poking at that again, and have some updates pending (mostly dependency-related).  I also suspect that many of the deps are now in debian, though it's also "trivial" to build/run it yourself from an uberjar which includes *everything*, all you need is openjdk, (or directly from the src tree for that matter) if you're OK with that.
[05:13:29] <rlb> I haven't been using it myself for a while, but may start again soonish.

[12:40:12] <inwit> madduck: Folder structure replicates tag structure. Upon tagging, messages are moved to corresponding folders, while, upon syncing, corresponding tags are applied to messages found in folders. I'm using a custom script for the first part and afew for the second.
[12:44:37] <madduck> inwit: so you just freely duplicate messages to multiple folders if they have multiple tags? What happens when you mark a message as read in one folder, does the status update progagate to the other tags?
[12:46:00] <inwit> madduck: Exactly. Afaik, notmuch is transparent to multiple copies of messages files.
[12:46:25] <madduck> inwit: is your script online somewhere? I'd love to check it out.
[12:47:14] <inwit> https://paste.sr.ht/~inwit/018642e5c1cae1e57ae449006b6ed5087ae964d0
[12:47:30] <madduck> legend
[12:48:31] <inwit> The only weird thing is that you need a safe way to move files, since the UID must be unique in order to please Maildir. S
[12:50:39] <inwit> Having said that, I'm starting to feel ready to flatten out my folder structure completely into a single "Archive" folder and live dangerously... ;)
[12:52:11] <madduck> yeah, I am sort of tending that way to be honest. But I still think I'll need to serve something sensible to IMAP clients.
[12:56:04] <inwit> I feel you. In my case, I realized that an important role of my folders is to keep track and remind me of past projects, which indeed is not a very efficient way to do that.
[12:57:16] <inwit> Once I solve that project archiving functionality (with org-mode), I'm mostly free to give up folders entirely. That's the theory.
[12:57:17] <madduck> I don't need that on IMAP clients. I need a smart way to stay on top of things while on the road. And at the desk, I then use "views" of sorts
[13:00:31] <inwit> Yeah. In any case, noservice would be a really cool thing to have. But I don't have a server atm, so I guess I'll have to solve that first.

[17:32:11] <bremner> For running your own server, a notmuch extension to dovecot should be doable, but I don't know what the client experience would be like
[17:33:16] <madduck> i think the big question is what happens when a user moves a message from a virtual folder to anotherâ€¦

[17:54:33] <acdw> do any of yall use lieer? https://github.com/gauteh/lieer i have some problems with tagging, etc
[17:54:33] <madduck> what tag set though? say you move from (new and not:spam) to (spam). Does it remove "new"? What happens to any other tags on the message?
[18:11:41] <acdw> it's mostly stuff with inbox and sent messages i believe
[18:19:13] <acdw> i need to do more testing i think ... soryr i should've thought about that before asking here

[22:10:08] <lagash> My worry with the whole "safe moving" of mails by renaming UIDs is, what if I had some sort of (say, Org) link to an email, and now it's obsolete?
[22:11:11] <madduck> i think your Org needs to link to a msgid
[22:11:35] <madduck> the filesystem is so off limits ;)
[22:11:51] <madduck> msgid and then use notmuch to retrieve the filename if really need it, or just the content.
[22:11:55] <lagash> Oh. msgid? So that's different from UID?
[22:12:24] <lagash> We talking Message-ID, like the email header?
[22:13:16] <madduck> yeah
[22:13:19] <madduck> it won't change
[22:13:50] <madduck> that is the message's UID. The UID you are talking about is who-knows-whose, and should not be assumed stable.
[22:26:05] <lagash> but are they unique? I remember a spec mentioning they SHOULD be unique in some way but sometimes aren't...
[22:28:19] <madduck> lagash: I think you should be fine counting on them being unique.
[22:28:35] <madduck> I've never encountered a collision in almost 30 years of being a mail server admin.
[22:28:38] <madduck> (gosh!)
[22:33:11] <lagash> not even with spammers?
[22:34:23] <bremner> Crappy enterprise software seems to duplicate message-ids sometimes
[22:36:41] <bremner> But in practice it has not been a problem for me personally
[22:44:36] <madduck> i would hope all spammers start using the same msgid
[22:45:42] <lagash> I was thinking masquerading off of msgids for legitimate mail but OK, time to modify my Emacs config again :)
[22:48:02] *** Joins: acdw (~case@user/acdw)
[22:58:57] <bremner> lagash: most message ids have a random part, so unless the message is known, it's a bit hard to spoof
[23:00:23] <bremner> Spammers seem generally to think anything with an @ in it is an email address. Not exactly rfc experts.
