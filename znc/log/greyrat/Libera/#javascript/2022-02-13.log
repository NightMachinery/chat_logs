[00:33:53] <jellobot> jwpapi, Getters and Setters are incompatible with the reflective semantics of JS. Using them will result in code that interacts in awkward (and error-prone!) ways with idiomatic JS libraries. They're also usually harder to optimise and reason about. Since JS isn't a message-passing language, using plain properties is usually a better idea.

[04:14:10] <pavonia> "I think this is the least clear: '#' + nextValue.replace( '#', '' )" <-- I think this is more clear than option one
[04:14:31] <pavonia> and shorter than option 2
[04:14:33] <KevinX> which operation happens first?
[04:15:02] <KevinX> That seems ambiguous to me
[04:15:12] <pavonia> In what way?
[04:15:13] <KevinX> or something your brain at least needs a few ticks to compute
[04:15:40] <KevinX> Cause i read left to right
[04:16:04] <pavonia> . binds stronger than +, do you mean that?
[04:16:12] <KevinX> I like the first one because it's clear you're tryingt o filter out double #
[04:16:59] <KevinX> I think the order of operations isn't as clear in that last one
[04:17:22] <KevinX> I personally know the rules, but when scanning it might cause a pause
[04:18:52] <KevinX> The ternary is clear but more verbose. it's fine though and probably easier for most people to read as well
[04:19:00] <KevinX> I wonder which would be more performant though now
[04:19:20] <KevinX> the ternary would seem to have one less op
[04:21:36] <KevinX> Actually, I need to do nextValue?.startsWith( '#' ) because it could be undefined

[04:59:27] <sickdyd> I guess it shouldn't matter, but I still have to increase the version on npm

[04:59:53] <sickdyd> sheetjs: what does that mean?
[04:59:57] <sheetjs> if the JS code is unchanged and all you did was introduce a TS file that transpiles to the same JS
[05:00:10] <sickdyd> yeah! that's what I thought too
[05:00:12] <sheetjs> then it stands to reason that the JS file is unchanged and therefore no need to change or publish

[05:01:43] <sickdyd> hmm.. does it?
[05:01:46] <sheetjs> was defaultProps something that was previously exposed in JS?
[05:01:56] <sheetjs> or was it something in the typedefs
[05:02:32] <sickdyd> so before TS I was using import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
[05:02:57] <sheetjs> oh then that's probably a minor change
[05:03:09] <systemfault> sickdyd: Should be a major.
[05:03:10] <sickdyd> makes sense
[05:03:38] <systemfault> You changed the runtime behavior.
[05:03:51] <sickdyd> systemfault: I see
[05:04:04] <sheetjs> then pretty much every change is a major change
[05:04:40] <systemfault> sheetjs: sickdyd changed the whole way proptypes are validated, it went from runtime-based to compile-time based.
[05:04:49] <systemfault> sheetjs: So, whatever man.
[05:05:04] <sheetjs> so the interesting question is whether code that was previously valid is still valid
[05:05:22] <sheetjs> it would make sense to do a major change if it broke something that previously was valid

[05:07:32] <systemfault> Some assumptions are now broken... someone using their lib from JS is now unprotected from passing bad data as propts.
[05:07:35] <systemfault> *props
[05:08:00] <sickdyd> that's true, now I'm wondering: should I retain PropTypes as well?
[05:08:13] <sheetjs> "MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, " "MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and "
[05:08:24] <sheetjs> it's unclear what "backwards compatible" means
[05:08:42] <sheetjs> is it merely "something that worked before, still works", in which case the change is minor
[05:09:02] <systemfault> sickdyd: Is it a public library or just for your workspace? If the latter, is it used only from TS or both JS and TS?
[05:09:06] <sheetjs> or is it "the correctness property of each input remains unchanged", which would imply everything is a breaking change

[08:47:55] <sheetjs> dunno if this was an intended design decision, but async really favors the usage of normal loops
[08:50:55] <KevinX> you can combine map with Promise.all
[08:51:27] <systemfault> But it promotes the usage of try/catch which are not expressions.
[08:52:06] <systemfault> Also, if you want to use async iterators, you're often forced to use for await of
[08:52:29] <sheetjs> trying to translate a test suite from mocha 2.x to deno
[08:52:39] <sheetjs> and deno does this await stuff on every step

[15:27:22] <hassoon_> velix: ah okey :p
[15:27:22] <velix> Maybe it's a npx problem. Let me install it the normal way.
[15:27:36] <Alexendoo> It's not
[15:28:13] <velix> Maxdamantus: the minified version: for(let o=0;o<10;o++)foo(function(){return o});
[15:28:13] <Maxdamantus> velix: I guess that case would be a bug then, if it doesn't do any other transformations.
[15:28:26] <velix> Maxdamantus: it does do other transformations, like the function.
[15:28:38] <Alexendoo> https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/297
[15:29:05] <Maxdamantus> Right, but looking at the IE11 `let` caveat on MDN, it needs to do a different transformation there to create a separate binding within the loop body.

[15:30:13] <velix> Alexendoo: "There are plenty of tools to help you (babel-preset-env, browserlist) and esbuild doesn't have to be that tool."
[15:30:21] <velix> Okay, babel-plugin for esbuild ;)
[15:30:55] <velix> I wonder why he integrates --target at all then.
[15:31:03] <velix> Better drop it than do it incomplete.
[15:31:07] <Maxdamantus> Anyway, I haven't really looked into esbuild, but I don't disagree with that approach.

[15:31:43] <Alexendoo> You're using 0.x software, it should be expected not everything is complete
[15:31:56] <Alexendoo> Dropping stuff instead of finishing them would just be a step backwards
[15:32:00] <Maxdamantus> It expects that it's already compiled to the desired level. Most packages afaik still normally distribute compiled ES5 code.
[15:32:26] <Maxdamantus> When I use `tsc`, I specify the "es5" target.
[15:32:57] <Maxdamantus> if I used esbuild, I would also specify the "es5" target there, so that it doesn't invent its own non-es5 code.
[15:33:25] <velix> Alexendoo: True. But right now, esbuild doesn't warn in "--target=ie11", but it does in "--target=es5". this seems like a bug to me.

Most likely I think the ideal way is to return either person if isMatched is true and use person.type instead of 'personType' but possibility wise, is there some solution where I can hypothetically do something like const [matched, person] = people.find() => { return [isMatched,
[21:38:05] <meder> person] } in the example above? I tried the latter but the callback applies to the find filtering solely

[22:09:03] <KevinX> you could set something up with cypress probably
[22:11:50] <KevinX> otherwise you probbly need to trigger the change or input event for that component to pick up the change. Maybe even the blur event
[22:12:30] <KevinX> I'd switch to cypress though

[22:14:30] <p-i-_> If I can fudge it I'd rather do that, as I'm overextended on this project.
[22:15:23] <p-i-_> I thought I _was_ triggering the change... u.dispatchEvent(new Event('change'))
[22:15:41] <p-i-_> I can't explain that console output
[22:23:00] <KevinX> not sure but the component probably doesn't use the value in the input directly
[22:23:41] <KevinX> you'll likely need to focus in there and then blur out for it to trigger
[22:24:09] <KevinX> I'd suggest cypress still. It's easier than you think. You just say "open the page, click here, click there, assert you see this"
[22:24:33] <KevinX> you run it in an interactive browser too so you can see it and tweak as needed
