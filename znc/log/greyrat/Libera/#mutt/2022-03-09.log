And I have added it to my .muttrc with this line: set signature="~/.mutt/sig” But my signature still does not appear when I compose or reply to a message. What is missing in my configuration? What else should I do to get my email signature appear in my messages?

[07:41:12] <kevin8t8> LohanG: that should be all that's needed.  Either something else in your muttrc is overwriting the value of $signature, or perhaps there is a permission problem.
[07:42:16] <kevin8t8> LohanG: while mutt is running, type ':set ?signature' and verify it prints out "~/.mutt/.sig", to check that mutt has the right value.

[07:50:47] <LohanG> Thanks kevin8t8! It does print out "~/.mutt/.sig"...
[07:51:36] <LohanG> Sorry it prints out "~/.mutt/sig" without the .
[07:52:04] <LohanG> should it be .sig? Does it matter?
[07:55:51] <LohanG> My .muttrc is basically this. I am not sure what overwrites the signature value : https://paste.debian.net/1233516/
[08:00:45] <kevin8t8> LohanG: it looks like the final "quote" character on the 'set signature=' line in your muttrc is not a double-quote
[08:01:42] <kevin8t8> LohanG: probably copy-pasted from somewhere.  try deleting it an typing in an actual double-quote character yourself
[08:02:42] <LohanG> Oh I see! will do. I once had this weird problem because I had typed a Unicode character as a quotation mark. This could be it!
[08:03:18] <kevin8t8> LohanG: yeah, Mutt is probably treating that character as part of the file-name
[08:03:32] <kevin8t8> LohanG: so it can't find the file (since it doesn't exist)

[14:38:12] <Guest86> need help with Mutt and CRON
[14:38:42] <Guest86> I build a litte script that get mails from IMAP server store it to disk 1 file for each email
[14:39:53] <Guest86> but if I run the same script with cron got this message: "No recipients were specified"
[14:40:07] <Guest86> I compared the env but looks good
[14:40:25] <Guest86> try to find somthine with strace but did not have success...
[14:40:53] <Guest86> anybody have a example script that runs with cron ? that I can find my misate in my script please ?

[15:03:08] <mp4> hi, is it possible to limit (l) threads which consist no replies?
[15:12:35] <rkta> Guest86: It's unlikely that anyone has a script that will help you find the error. You should share your script, then we can have a look.
[15:23:16] <rkta> mp4: maybe some thing like !~h In-[rR]eply-[tT]o:
[15:29:51] <Guest86> @rkta
[15:30:13] <Guest86> pastebin or here ? how to share ?
[15:31:24] <rkta> Guest86: not here, never paste into irc. Use a paste service which does not require javascript.
[15:33:26] <Guest86> lets try:
[15:33:27] <Guest86> https://pastebin.com/mFLeR9xV
[15:38:52] <sdk_> Is this in the crontab of the user that has mutt configured?
[15:39:14] <sdk_> Or accidentially the crontab that runs as root?
[15:47:57] <Guest86> in the user crontab
[15:57:07] <sdk_> Guest86: where does the recipient come from?
[15:57:56] <Guest86> i dont know - if I run the script on console it works... no message about recipient
[15:58:19] <sdk_> I'm trying to understand what mutts job is in this script
[16:01:06] <Guest86> mutt download the email and store it to a file to /tmp/email   1 file for each mail
[16:02:59] <sdk_> ah now i see the delete message... so the expectation is, mutt opens and one message is selected. then you push/pipe it to your script which does the parsing and saving

[17:14:33] <Guest86> but download the emails wenn run on console
[17:16:54] <rkta> Guest86: I got that, but you will need to debug this to find out why. I just gave my gut feeling and said how I would start.
