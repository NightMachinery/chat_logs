[05:58:27] <Lebela> hi
[05:58:37] <Lebela> ffmpeg -i out6.mp4 -r 30 -filter:v "setpts=0.20*PTS" -vf "ass=subtitles.ass" -vf "eq=saturation=1.4,curves=preset=darker" -preset ultrafast -crf 10 -an -pix_fmt yuv420p out12.mp4
[05:58:58] <Lebela> what is the reason,  why ffmpeg ignored the speeding-up, namely:  "setpts=0.20*PTS"  ?
[05:59:08] <Lebela> when I run  "setpts=0.20*PTS"  without any other filters,  it works
[05:59:20] <Lebela> but the moment I combine   "setpts=0.20*PTS"   with other filters  (e.g. saturation)  it fails
[06:08:34] <aphysically> is segment_time_metadata=1 with ffconcat mostly just useful if you're using non-intra codecs?
[06:10:39] <furq> Lebela: you can only specify -vf once
[06:10:59] <Lebela> furq, I have tried to combine it, but it also failed
[06:11:13] <Lebela> ffmpeg -i out6.mp4 -r 30 -filter:v "setpts=0.20*PTS" -vf "ass=subtitles.ass:curves=preset=darker:eq=saturation=1.4" -preset ultrafast -crf 10 -an -pix_fmt yuv420p out12.mp4

[06:11:45] <furq> also those will be applied in that order which might not be what you want

[06:14:34] <Lebela> furq, can I pick your brain one more time?
[06:14:58] <Lebela> the video is a recording of a construction site,  taken over the duration of 1 year
[06:15:25] <Lebela> even though the original footage is already faster than real life,  it is still 50 hours long
[06:15:54] <Lebela> my initial idea was,  to add the days  (day 1,  day 2, day 3, etc.)  to the 50 hours long footage
[06:16:01] <Lebela> and after that,  I would speed it up
[06:16:23] <Lebela> but, combining the speeding up process with the subtitles and the saturation would save a lot of time
[06:16:43] <Lebela> how can I be sure, the subtitles get added at the correct time?
[06:16:58] <Lebela> the video must be sped up *before* the subtitles get added
[06:17:12] <Lebela> otherwise, the subtitles would be wrong (the amount of days)

[06:17:42] <crashrep> filters are chained together , one to the next, in the order from first to last
[06:18:25] <Lebela> crashrep, so, the first argument gets worked on first?
[06:18:52] <crashrep> yes
[06:19:23] <Lebela> ffmpeg -i out6.mp4 -r 30 -filter:v "setpts=0.20*PTS,curves=preset=darker,eq=saturation=1.4,ass=subtitles.ass" -preset ultrafast -crf 10 -an -pix_fmt yuv420p out12.mp4
[06:19:35] <Lebela> ^ please let me try to translate this in my own words:
[06:19:40] <crashrep> also, you may want to add another filter "framerate=fps=30000/1001" or "framerate=fps=60000/1001" so that after you speed up the footage it discards the in-between frames, so to say
[06:19:46] <Lebela> 1) speed up 5x
[06:19:49] <Lebela> 2) make it darker
[06:19:52] <Lebela> 3) add saturation
[06:20:02] <crashrep> yep, so the filters in that order will be 1. speed up, 2. curves, 3. eq effect, 4. apply subtitles
[06:20:07] <Lebela> 4) add subtitles to the already sped up video,  after changing the colors
[06:20:36] <crashrep> yep, that's right
[06:20:56] <Lebela> crashrep, please explain filter "framerate=fps=30000/1001" and "framerate=fps=60000/1001" to me, please
[06:21:14] <Lebela> the footage has 30 fps at the moment
[06:22:06] <crashrep> ok, when you apply setpts=0.20*PTS (which is analogous to speeding up to 5x speed) the resulting video would be 150fps, so you could save some space if you set the fps to 30 (or 60), it will discard the other frames that you likely wouldn't see anyway
[06:22:41] <Lebela> I did that with -r 30
[06:22:57] <Lebela> but your command looks way more sophisticated
[06:23:54] <Lebela> oh, I know what your math is... that is, because the framerate is not exactly 30 fps in some countries
[06:24:02] <Lebela> there is something about 29.97 fps
[06:24:33] <Lebela> crashrep, is  -r 30  the same as  framerate=fps=30   ?
[06:25:06] <crashrep> kind of
[06:25:22] <crashrep> -r 30 is the fps filter, as oppsoed to the framerate filter, and they are slightly different but do the same thing
[06:25:50] <Lebela> which one is the "better" one for what I am supposed to do?
[06:25:53] <crashrep> https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#fps-1 and https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#framerate
[06:26:23] <Lebela> which one is the one you tell me to use?
[06:26:37] <crashrep> i usually use framerate tbh
[06:26:41] <Lebela> thank you
[06:26:50] <Lebela> should I really go with 30000/1001  ?
[06:26:51] <Lebela> or 30 ?
[06:26:52] <crashrep> you can insert it after the setpts filter in the video filter chain
[06:27:02] <Lebela> ffprobe -v error -select_streams v -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 -show_entries stream=r_frame_rate footage.mp4
[06:27:02] <Lebela> 30/1
[06:27:02] <crashrep> no, you can use 30, nothing wrong with that
[06:27:11] <Lebela> this is what my original footage outputs
[06:27:44] <Lebela> ffmpeg -i out6.mp4 -r 30 -filter:v "setpts=0.20*PTS,framerate=fps=30,curves=preset=darker,eq=saturation=1.4,ass=subtitles.ass" -preset ultrafast -crf 10 -an -pix_fmt yuv420p out12.mp4
[06:27:51] <Lebela> ^ is this what I am supposed to do?
[06:28:12] <crashrep> yes, that looks right to me
[06:28:19] <Lebela> I should have come here 2 days ago... I have tried and tried and tried... and now,  it's all clear after 20 minutes of IRC
[06:28:24] <Lebela> thank you, crashrep !
[06:28:35] <crashrep> haha, glad i could help. hope that will work for you.
[06:28:36] <Lebela> sorry for bugging you so much
[06:28:41] <Lebela> thank you so much for saving me! :)
[06:28:54] <crashrep> it's my pleasure

[06:29:35] <Lebela> how do you actually think about noise in videos?
[06:29:52] <Lebela> the footage was taken with a 4K camera of a phone,  and the quality is pretty good,  but it lacks noise.
[06:30:04] <Lebela> the ultafast preset  (which is supposed to give bad results) added a little noise
[06:30:11] *** Quits: jerome- (~jerome@88.173.24.196) (Remote host closed the connection)
[06:30:27] <Lebela> and I personally think, that this little noise from "ultrafast" looks way better that "veryslow" which keeps the video totally smooth
[06:30:36] <crashrep> i'm confused what you mean by adding noise?
[06:30:51] <Lebela> when I use -crf 10 -preset ultrafast,   a  little noise gets added
[06:31:04] <crashrep> you could also try bumping up the -crf value, because that changes the quality of encoding, and higher value is more compressed
[06:31:05] <Lebela> when I use  -crf 10 -preset veryslow,   no noise gets added
[06:31:18] <crashrep> try -crf 30 or so, and see how it looks
[06:31:41] <Lebela> yep, I have tried the values up and down,  and I personally really like crf 10 with preset ultrafast
[06:31:53] <Lebela> I am just wondering, because stackoverflow massively warns against ultrafast

[06:32:04] <crashrep> huh, ok. neat
[06:32:05] <Lebela> but I find,  that ultrafast with crf 10 gives me the best results

[06:32:58] <Lebela> thank you for your time

[06:33:07] <Lebela> see you!
[06:33:15] <Lebela> I am out,  thank you again
[06:33:18] <crashrep> well for stackoverflow, it's because you have the classic tradeoff between quality and speed of encoding, so setting ultrafast for encoding is good for speed (like if you are livestreaming) but if you are rendering a video usually people like to use slower presets
[06:33:20] <crashrep> for higher quality
[06:33:28] <crashrep> no prob, cya later
[06:33:43] <Lebela> I just saw your message... let me quickly answer
[06:33:57] <Lebela> I just meant to leave because I did not mean to bother you any longer, but I should answer your last message
[06:34:12] <Lebela> yes, I understand that "ultrafast" leads to worse results than "veryslow"
[06:34:17] <crashrep> so that's why, but if you are fine with how it looks (or in this case you like it betteR) it is totally fine to use ultraast
[06:34:18] <Lebela> that is, why I wondered about that I found out

[14:55:56] <aphysically> this subtitle thing is pretty annoying; I was okay with just the color of the subtitles being off but I didn't realize applying the dolby vision metadata while the subtitles were on screen would mess up the color of the entire image
[14:58:24] <galad> yup subtitles should be composed after tonemapping, and if the subtitles color space is different they should be converted to the same colorspace as the video

[20:04:04] <ilimugur> Hey everyone. I tried to concatenate multiple videos using `ffmpeg -f concat`, but the particular method I used seems to be incorrect. (i.e., the resulting output is skipping certain videos)
[20:04:43] <ilimugur> I wrote a detailed question about it in StackOverflow a couple of months ago, but I never got an answer, which finally led me here. Is there anyone available to maybe take a look and suggest some ideas for me to try out?
[20:04:43] <ilimugur> Here's the link to the question I posted to SO: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69889954/ffmpeg-multiple-video-concatenation-prints-non-monotonous-dts-and-contains-skips
[20:08:42] <kepstin> rubynt: no. Note that an X11 display argument like ":0.0" does not specify a specific monitor, but rather a "screen" which is a virtual screen which can be made of multiple monitors.
[20:09:57] <kepstin> (with manual reconfiguration of your X11 server you may be able to put each monitor onto a separate x11 screen, but setting up your x11 server is kind of out of scope for this channel)
[20:10:49] <kepstin> it's possible that xcbgrab could be enhanced to use the xinerama extension to find out about monitor boundaries, but you'd have to find someone to work on that or develop it yourself :)

[21:46:00] *** Joins: MrZeus__ (~MrZeus@81.92.205.22)
[21:46:08] <JEEB> see the examples, f.ex. the transcoding one to see how you utilize the codecpar from the AVStream to get parameters into your own AVCodecContext

[22:13:49] <RicochetOfLove> Hi, I've been looking for infos on whether  I should use `-hwaccel cuda -hwaccel_output_format cuda` and/or `-c:v h264_cuvid` (or `-c:v hevc_cuvid`) to leverage my Nvidia GPU decoding capabilities and I've been scrolling through ffmpeg official docs and/or wiki but I haven't found anything, is there anyone who could enlighten me please?
[22:15:50] <JEEB> hwaccel should be your preferred one
[22:17:11] <RicochetOfLove> In case it'd be useful to know, I've an Intel Core i7-8700K and an Nvidia GTX 1070 Mobile
[22:23:27] <RicochetOfLove> Thanks Jeeb
[22:23:52] <RicochetOfLove> oops I didn't mean to ping(?) you

[22:27:27] <JEEB> the difference is that with hwaccel most of the format parsing etc is done via FFmpeg, and the nvidia libraries are used only for the core decoding
[22:27:43] <JEEB> while the cuvid wrappers do more of the parsing etc on that side
[22:28:04] <JEEB> (and the more you leave to nvidia's libraries the more possible bugs you'll enjoy that you might not be able to fix)
[22:28:37] <RicochetOfLove> wow
[22:29:08] *** Joins: alban771 (~alban@37.165.75.13)
[22:29:32] <RicochetOfLove> ffmpeg is so well built there was no process time trade-off between the `-hwaccel` and the `-c:v`
[22:29:40] <RicochetOfLove> that's super-neat

[22:46:30] <aphysically> hmmm actually I'm not sure if I *can* overlay pic subtitles after applying metadata
[22:46:46] <RicochetOfLove> You meant the bottleneck is ffmpeg parsing in place of nvdec one?
[22:46:46] <aphysically> iirc the overlay filter is really weird with bit depth
[22:46:49] <aphysically> need to experiment
[22:48:18] <furq> there should be a corresponding yuva format you can use

[22:49:19] <aphysically> and just convert the overlaid part tot he proper yuva first? yeah I'll try it
[22:49:19] <JEEB> RicochetOfLove: both are CPU-based parsing since both need to end up with blobs that they pass to the decoding black box
[22:49:50] <furq> overlay should do that for you

[22:52:16] <aphysically> I wonder, since it's not safe to put subtitles on video before applying dolby vision metadata, I wonder if it's not safe to crop either
[22:54:16] <aphysically> I suspect it's not
[22:54:32] <aphysically> (for context: overlaying subtitles was changing the color of the rest of the frame, not just the subtitles)
[22:54:50] <RicochetOfLove> Is there a command to list `-hwaccel cuda` available arguments just like you can use `-h encoder=<encoder name>` to list the arguments/options of an encoder for instance?
[22:55:56] <JEEB> hwaccels generally have very few options. mostly the device you want to utilize (in case you have multiple for that API), and the output surface type
[22:56:04] <furq> yeah i would assume you want to apply dv metadata before anything else
[22:56:07] <furq> since that's what'd happen on the disc
[22:56:14] <RicochetOfLove> I see, thx
[22:56:29] <JEEB> the actual decoder doing the parsing might have more options
[22:56:38] <aphysically> yeah this is just gross; it means I have to add an extra hwdownload
[22:56:39] <JEEB> but I am not sure how many of those are relevant
[22:56:59] <JEEB> since instead of actually doing decoding with the thing that most of the options will probably be for
[22:57:11] <JEEB> you're doing the parsing, and then passing those buffers into a black box :)

[22:59:34] <RicochetOfLove> do you refer to the NVDEC hw device as a "black box"?
[23:00:04] <RicochetOfLove> do you call it so because it's not a well-known/documented device? '=D
[23:00:22] <JEEB> it's a thing to which you feed something and you receive something
[23:00:36] <JEEB> it's the hardware ASIC
[23:01:34] <RicochetOfLove> in this case, I feed it the encoded data packets and I receive the decoded frames of an input file, don't I?
[23:02:25] <RicochetOfLove> Thanks for the patience, I'm starting to grasp better everything you've explained

My problem was there is grabbing area(grab_x graby) and i though this
[23:33:16] <rubynt> can limit my recording area to one screen but it didnt work out.

[23:57:26] <aphysically> is there an easy way to check if a 10 bit encode didn't accidentally get chopped/dithered down to 8 bit in m y filtr graph (before later converted to 10 bit)?
[23:57:29] <aphysically> i.e. check the actual bit depth
[23:58:03] <DHE> ffrpobe and check the video format. yuv420p  would be 8-bit. if there's a "10" on that then it should be 10bit
[23:58:52] <aphysically> I mean actually measure it - I have an encoder that would convert it back to yuv420p10/p010le anyway, but that doesn't tell me if the subtitle or overlay filter brought it down to 8 bit in the middle of my filter graph
[23:59:15] <aphysically> which is what I'm trying to double check
