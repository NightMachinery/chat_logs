[14:24:56] <arahael> node1: That said, you could simply load the executables and hook into that code, so it really depends.

[23:22:21] <No1x3r0> how can I find how the source of a security issue I'm having that may have be caused by any number of different distro ISOs provided online ?

[23:23:56] <ajak> you're trying to figure out which ISO made you vulnerable to something?
[23:24:13] <Mathisen> maybe provide some details....
[23:24:21] <No1x3r0> ajak, yeah
[23:24:36] <No1x3r0> Mathisen, I have the loki exploit in my firmware
[23:24:40] <ajak> well, check each ISO
[23:25:03] <No1x3r0> ajak, I no longer have said ISOs, I had tried quite a number of distros
[23:25:47] <No1x3r0> ajak, and that's the thing, I wouldn't even begin to know where or how to check on said ISOs

[23:27:35] <Mathisen> still confused.. are you saying you got a malware from a linux dist iso
[23:27:59] <No1x3r0> Mathisen, are you familiar with loki and coreboot ?
[23:28:17] <Mathisen> not loki but i know coreboot
[23:29:02] <No1x3r0> Mathisen, it's suspect that some distro is exploiting firmware with the loki exploit

[23:29:47] <ajak> why do you suspect this?
[23:30:05] <No1x3r0> ajak, because I ran the hardware test on PureOS
[23:30:06] <Mathisen> link me to some info on what loki is
[23:30:18] <No1x3r0> Mathisen, I'm looking

[23:40:41] <Mathisen> that dont really say much.
[23:40:51] <No1x3r0> maybe it's related to https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-266a

[23:41:31] <Mathisen> and that page says it targets windows and android not linux
[23:41:57] <Mathisen> yeah yeah android is linux but not really
[23:42:08] <No1x3r0> Mathisen, do you want screenshots of vendor change in my Firmware?
[23:42:32] <Mathisen> sure
[23:42:46] <No1x3r0> also I believe it's related to problems I had regardining ACPI and hangs on mac restore
[23:43:12] <No1x3r0> Mathisen that first link I sent said nothing about Windows
[23:43:30] <Mathisen> nope but the second did
[23:44:00] <Mathisen> no need for this.. im just confused what you think really happend here.
