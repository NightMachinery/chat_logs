[01:30:28] <pyzozord> on it's own it isn't an operator, just a string to match

[01:32:26] <pyzozord> empty string is easy just do "^$"

[01:32:37] <Izem> grep '' foo does match my file with only newlines

[05:51:12] <SoF> Hi! a question about the visitor pattern, is it still the visitor pattern if I have a graph.visit(visitor) function, that calls the visitor's accept method for all nodes in the graph in some order?
[05:51:39] <SoF> sorry, wrong way around
[05:51:56] <SoF> graph.accept(visitor) and visitor.visit(node)

[05:52:26] <SoF> because the examples I've seen (especially on wikipedia) show a single visitor.visit call for a tree (expression tree), e.g. here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern

[05:56:36] <SoF> instead of e.g. the Car.Accept function taking a visitor, it could just return an iterator that iterates over its components?
[05:57:04] <SoF> same thing for my graph, I could just return an iterator that iterates over all nodes instead

[08:51:17] <InPhase> aaaa: Did you use the same cout routine to output right after initializing as a test?

[08:55:24] <InPhase> aaaa: Well, if you can't spot the problem, the next step is to try to make a self-contained complete testcase which reproduces your problem.  Then you can share it in a pastebin and ask for help, explaining the expected result.

[17:48:27] <Arahael> C? I find C's interop awful!
[17:48:36] <LordKalma> it's not?
[17:48:40] <beaky> nice i like the jvm
[17:49:01] <LordKalma> I mean, it's native code, but it's ABI stable and not mangled, there isn't a language that doesn't have a system to load symbols from a C dll
[17:49:22] <Arahael> LordKalma: I can name a few. :)

[17:49:31] <deniska> C interop is basically "you have a label to jump to, hopefully you put stuff in the right registers and stack for the version of a compiler I was compiled with"
[17:49:32] <LordKalma> I actually can't
[17:49:47] <pulse> nice, i like C
[17:49:57] <Arahael> LordKalma: Javascript (and most languages in a sandbox), and I believe Erlang.
[17:50:07] <Arahael> LordKalma: Oh, and Go.
[17:50:24] <LordKalma> laughs in node.js
[17:50:25] <LordKalma> jk
[17:50:25] <gggp> sandbox is vm
[17:50:30] <deniska> The biggest problem isn't even C itself, but ELF/PE formats
[17:50:45] <Rounin> C's interop is probably helped by the fact that 1) C is very common and popular, and 2) C has very simple data types
[17:50:48] <Arahael> And I hate that you have to guess how the compiler compiled it.
[17:51:07] <gggp> how to get rid of segment fault
[17:51:15] <Rounin> Lots of work was done on D to make it compatible with C++, for instance, and just the process of digging through the stack to catch exceptions was apparently a ton of work
[17:51:16] <sandman13> use gdb
[17:51:18] <sandman13> read code
[17:51:26] <sandman13> that's how you get rid of segmentation fault
[17:51:30] <Rounin> I think just resuming the program after exceptions was a ton of work, never mind catching them
[17:51:46] <Rounin> Now once you add the standard library to that, you can imagine
[17:51:56] <deniska> C is useful as the common denominator two random languages may have just due to C being that popular
[17:52:08] <deniska> doesn't mean it's a good to bind programs together :)
[17:52:14] <deniska> it's a good way*
[17:52:30] <sandman13> I nearly got my pitchfork ready deniska
[17:52:50] <LordKalma> SWIG does bindings by generating C code for your eg. c++ code, and then use that
[17:52:55] <deniska> doesn't mean it's a good way to bind programs together :) // I missed the word
[17:53:00] <LordKalma> if it throws? well, i'm sorry :D
[17:53:11] <deniska> anyway, interacting with C++ is even worse, but I mean :)
[17:53:55] <sandman13> If you like barebones and something is that present almost everywhere C
[17:54:25] <deniska> or let trol for a bit: C ABI is so bad, that JSON over HTTP via loopback is often deemed a better solution for plugins, like what LSP is doing
[17:54:45] <davros> C fits the bill because of its simplicity
[17:54:57] <davros> cant bind to C++ without being C++ pretty much
[17:55:04] <sandman13> LSP is just pushed by a corporation
[17:55:07] <sandman13> xD
[17:55:13] <LordKalma> I just wished for a C++ standard ABI
[17:55:17] <LordKalma> that would solve most things
[17:55:26] <InPhase> LordKalma: Agreed.
[17:55:27] <deniska> Arguably it's the only good thing this corporation pushed in the previous 40 years

[17:55:35] <Rounin> Well, you have "whatever Windows is using", "whatever MacOS is using" and "whatever Linux is using"
[17:55:36] <LordKalma> I CAN DREAM
[17:55:44] <Rounin> on whatever CPU they're using
[17:55:51] <sandman13> deniska: on paper yes, on reality, umm no.
[17:55:57] <deniska> Rounin: and whether they use msvc or mingw on windows
[17:56:09] <LordKalma> or what version of GCC
[17:56:11] <sandman13> I always had problems with LSP
[17:56:14] <deniska> Rounin: and on linux we had the whole gcc vs egcc thing for quite a while
[17:56:21] <LordKalma> or the flag to turn on the pre C++11 string ABI
[17:56:26] <Rounin> Well, whatever compiler you use, you're going to want to use whatever abi MSVC uses, surely
[17:56:29] <Rounin> On Windows
[17:56:37] <Rounin> Who wants an application that can't use DLLs
[17:56:45] <Rounin> Or a DLL that can't be used by applications
[17:56:47] <deniska> in windows land you can just go with COM instead if you feel like 90s :D
[17:56:52] <sandman13> Between gcc or egcc, the choice is neither. Use tcc like a madman
[17:56:58] <Rounin> :D
[17:57:05] <LordKalma> Rounin, if you compile C++ with mingw you can't link with that with msvc
[17:57:18] <Rounin> I often compile my applications with tinycc and zig cc etc. just to make sure they work
[17:57:19] <LordKalma> you can if you're compiling  because, again, standard ABI
[17:57:47] <Rounin> LordKalma: You mean mingw doesn't support msvc's abi at all?
[17:57:50] <Rounin> What's the use of that
[17:57:52] <sandman13> I sometimes wonder
[17:57:55] <LordKalma> it's a gcc compiler
[17:58:01] <LordKalma> it has the GCC ABI
[17:58:03] <LordKalma> what do you want?
[17:58:05] <sandman13> What would have happened if Unix was written in Lisp?
[17:58:27] <Rounin> LordKalma: You make it sound like linking together some applications is an insurmountable obstacle
[17:58:35] <InPhase> Rounin: gcc and clang share an abi.  It's MSVC that's the outlier among the prominent C++ compilers.
[17:58:45] <LordKalma> you can only link whatever has the same compiler ABI

[17:59:03] <LordKalma> and same compiler flags, because the specifics affect the way things are mangled
[17:59:14] <LordKalma> so it's not that the problem is compiler interop anywya
[17:59:17] <pyzozord> oh interesting I thought that abi is part of the os itself
[17:59:31] <LordKalma> if you build something with debug and another things with release the mangling might be different
[17:59:35] <pyzozord> so compilers can't really deviate from what os abi is
[17:59:44] <Rounin> InPhase: That's kind of an uphill battle, don't you think? Thinking of MSVC as the "outlier" on Windows
[17:59:46] <InPhase> Rounin: If MSVC adopted the ABI that gcc and clang have agreed to, there would already be a defacto C++ ABI.
[18:00:14] <InPhase> Rounin: Well "on Windows" doesn't mean what it used to.
[18:00:18] <Rounin> LordKalma: I'm pretty sure the authors of MingGW would be able to figure out how to mangle names the same way MSVC does
[18:00:21] <LordKalma> MSVC didn't even have a stable ABI until 2015
[18:00:29] <Rounin> LordKalma: I mean, they wrote MinGW for one thing
[18:00:29] <LordKalma> Rounin, mingw *IS GCC*
[18:00:31] <LordKalma> period.
[18:00:48] <LordKalma> the only thing it has of special is a windows runtime
[18:00:52] <Rounin> LordKalma: So they don't support the MSVC ABI by choice... Not a technological problem
[18:01:12] <LordKalma> repeat after me: mingw is a gcc compiler :D
[18:01:18] <Rounin> Windows has a standard, which they've chosen not to follow
[18:01:24] <InPhase> Rounin: mingw being gcc uses the same standard ABI of gcc and clang.
[18:01:24] <Rounin> LordKalma:  No actually, you repeat after me
[18:01:45] <Rounin> InPhase: Quod Erat Demonstrandum.
[18:02:03] <InPhase> Rounin: https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/
[18:02:09] <LordKalma> InPhase, that ABI includes the new string ABI right? Since I discovered there was a flag for that...
[18:02:11] <Rounin> InPhase: https://itanium-cxx-abi.github.io/cxx-abi/
[18:02:36] <InPhase> Rounin: It's just a classic case of Microsoft's old style refusal to adopt standards.
[18:02:53] <LordKalma> Even MSVC has a stable ABI since not long ago
[18:03:07] <LordKalma> the oldest interoperable runtime is 2015 isn't it?
[18:03:13] <LordKalma> so only 3 releases are ABI stable
[18:03:21] <LordKalma> well, 4 now
[18:03:48] <Rounin> InPhase: They've got their own platform... Why would they? You would get the marginal benefit of being able to link with Linux code on Windows, perhaps
[18:04:01] <Rounin> So you could compile code that made no system calls whatsoever for both OSes at once
[18:04:17] <Rounin> Or MinGW could just add a --use-msvc-linking flag and be done with it
[18:04:20] <InPhase> Rounin: Why would they?  So that there would be a single standard ABI in use on all platforms by all compilers, solving the problems described above.
[18:04:24] <LordKalma> it's not about "linux code on windows"
[18:04:37] <Rounin> InPhase:  Yes, why would they do that
[18:04:38] <LordKalma> you're mistaking ABI for something OS related
[18:04:43] <LordKalma> ABI is for compilers
[18:04:54] <Rounin> LordKalma: You're mistaken.
[18:04:57] <InPhase> Rounin: Because standards make things better for all developers.
[18:05:23] <LordKalma> discussing with you is like when i was 10 years old. "no you". I'm out
[18:05:33] <InPhase> Rounin: In the absence of standards, I as a developer just shake my head and try to avoid Windows whenever I can.
[18:05:33] <Rounin> InPhase: So far, the effect of the policy MinGW seems to have is that the output of their compiler is incompatible with other code on the same platform
[18:05:42] <sandman13> LordKalma: "no u"
[18:05:43] <sandman13> xD
[18:05:48] <LordKalma> that
[18:05:48] <LordKalma> hahaha
[18:05:49] <Rounin> LordKalma: Interesting. That's actually what discussing with you is like as well.
[18:05:55] <Rounin> Perhaps it is best that you leave the discussion.
[18:06:24] <LordKalma> the irony
[18:06:50] <Rounin> I'm not sure why people think "no u" is such a bad argument. Do people imagine that their arguments are good as long as they use them first?
[18:06:56] <gggp> c++ and rust ,which is preferred?
[18:07:05] <Rounin> "I was first, so now you can't say it"
[18:07:06] <InPhase> Rounin: In fact, every development platform has a uniform C++ ABI for every prominent compiler, and it's the same one on all platforms, except Windows where there's one that differs from the standard used on every other.  And Windows does not have enough prominence anymore to keep playing those sort of market thwarting games.
[18:07:08] <sandman13> gggp: C xD
[18:07:26] <gggp> sandman13, what mean
[18:07:49] <sandman13> gggp: Between C++ and Rust, use C (in a comical sense)
[18:07:51] <Rounin> InPhase: I'm pretty sure it does have enough prominence, and that MinGW is just being stubborn
[18:08:06] <InPhase> Rounin: So if I have to use Windows for something, I use mingw, and I do my best to avoid MSVC and its ignoring of standards.
[18:08:27] <LordKalma> InPhase, the itanium ABI is part of the POSIX standard, isn't it?

[19:22:58] <hi^-^> W: no for generally matching substrings and such

[20:21:41] <Izem> you can always get it from secondary sources
[20:21:59] <ullbeking> the thing with all these papers is that they eventually find their way into book form, so unless you're an academic, i recommend studying the classic books
[20:22:14] <Izem> ^
[20:22:18] <Izem> but sometimes, they only explain the concept, not what they did to get there
[20:22:47] <ullbeking> Izem: don't make your life difficult for yourself :-)
[20:22:50] <Izem> yeah book form is a lot easier
[20:23:02] <Izem> ullbeking: too late
[20:23:06] <pyzozord> GeDaMo: oh now it makes sense. I was familiar with that syntax but I didn't know it was called BNF before someone mentioned it today few hours ago. Now I know John Backus is another importat person in cs

[21:54:34] <Izem> When does a function get put on the stack?
[21:55:52] <deniska> Izem: what do you mean by that? What can live on stack are arguments passed to a function, local variables, maybe a return address
[21:56:16] <Izem> sorry, in terms of recursion
[21:56:26] <Izem> when a function gets called, what happens there?

[21:57:26] <deniska> the fact that it might be the same function doesn't matter much here
[21:57:54] <Izem> yeah, that whole process creates a stack right?
[21:58:36] <deniska> you typically have a single stack per program (well, per thread really, but let's assume a program has a single thread for sanity)
[21:59:02] <deniska> calling functions generally puts more stuff on stack, returning from functions removes it from stack

[22:03:27] <user51> they used to have special stack area too
[22:03:37] <deniska> basically it's just a convention of what a caller and a callee do to ensure that everything goes smooth

[22:29:31] <pyzozord> or I guess just "stack length" can be replaced with "stack pointer"
[22:29:39] <pyzozord> yeah!
[22:29:45] <GeDaMo> Stack traditionally grows downwards in memory
[22:30:50] <Izem> is the stack always located in a memory region?

[22:31:22] <GeDaMo> That sounds like a trick question :|
[22:31:28] <MrMobius> some have on chip stack which may only be a few levels deep
[22:31:34] <Izem> oh ok
[22:32:06] <Izem> I remember the chip maker tells how big the stack is and where it's located
[22:32:15] <Izem> so you can set that up with linker scripts
[22:33:02] <GeDaMo> The stack isn't at a fixed location
[22:33:20] <GeDaMo> You can have multiple stacks and switch between them, that's how user level thread switching is done
[22:33:30] <MrMobius> not fixed on modern chips but can be fixed on older ones like 6502 or maybe some microcontrollers

[22:34:41] <pyzozord> I think that abstractly stack is in the main memory, but I can imagine that actual implementations have many levels of cache, and the top levels of the stack are probably much closer to the cpu, maybe in cpu cache, maybe even some special dedicated stack caches wouldn't be that far of a stretch

[22:35:03] <deniska> pyzozord: well, to keep a stack you essentially need a pointer to memory
[22:35:19] <deniska> pyzozord: so a hardware stack is a dedicated register to keep this pointer
[22:35:32] <Izem> whether or not the stack is in the cache should be transparent
[22:35:44] <deniska> pyzozord: and instructions like push and pop which do "write this thing at stack pointer, and add 1 to stack pointer"
[22:36:03] <deniska> or "read this thing from stack pointer, and subtract 1 from strack pointer"
[22:36:07] <Izem> stack element*
[22:36:49] <pyzozord> ahh, so there might be some dedicated cirtutry about the address the stack pointer points to to not have that go through normal addressing logic but through something faster
[22:36:52] *** Quits: JanC (~janc@user/janc) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[22:37:31] <deniska> pyzozord: more like it's just a compact form to encode an instruction like "read a thing offset by this register and decrement one from this register"
[22:37:37] <GeDaMo> https://en.wikichip.org/w/images/7/7e/skylake_block_diagram.svg "Stack Engine" on the right
[22:37:45] <deniska> pyzozord: RISC kind of architectures probably won't have an instruction like that
[22:38:02] <deniska> pyzozord: because you can simulate what it's doing in 2-3 simpler instructions
[22:38:36] *** JanC_ is now known as JanC
[22:38:45] <GeDaMo> I think M68K had pre/post increment/decrement memory instructions, not just for stack
[22:38:53] <deniska> I guess on architectures with a dedicated stack pointer you may as well connect it to its own incrementor

[23:27:34] <ario> i thought nginx would measure how long it takes for a 200 response back
[23:28:00] <jeaye> nginx can't know 1. when the client started making the request; 2. when the client gets the response

[23:31:55] <jeaye> So there's some overhead there.
[23:31:57] <jeaye> Also, how long does it take to do the same request via curl on your dev machine?
[23:32:49] <pyzozord> the 100ms might be only part of the route like nginx -> nodejs app. I thnk you might be comparing apples to oranges
[23:33:08] <jeaye> Yeah. How long does the nodejs app say it takes?
[23:33:34] <jeaye> You can measure the curl time using something like: `time curl -H "My: Header" --data '{"my": "json"}' "https://my-url.com"`

[23:45:56] <pyzozord> if the empty html file query confirms that nginx responds with static html file in 400ms then question is why. Maybe ping to that nginx server is slow? That would indicate some networking issues probably in k8s. And if it's not ping then maybe it's an issue with nginx configuration
