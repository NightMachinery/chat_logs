[20:11:25] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> but I'm getting this error:↵`multi_threads2.nim(10, 1) Error: undeclared identifier: 'spawn'`
[20:13:03] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah
[20:13:10] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> don't use threadpool or spawn or any of that stuff in the stdlib
[20:13:22] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> at least that's my advice 🙂
[20:13:34] <FromDiscord> <Rika> if you want to (like in the example) put `--threads:on` prolly?
[20:15:01] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> `nim c -r --threads:on threads\multi_threads2.nim`

[20:15:23] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> In reply to @Gumber "don't use threadpool or": Why not?
[20:15:36] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> Have anyone used the bitsrange type
[20:15:49] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> because the implementations are bad
[20:16:00] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and Nim's changed a lot since those modules were authored
[20:16:12] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> has no one updated them?
[20:16:13] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> like it's memory model (if you use orc/arc) has changed in fundamental ways
[20:16:30] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i can compile it
[20:16:31] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I mean I'm sure they're updated and compiled but like optimal implementations of a thread pool / parallelize for implementation
[20:16:34] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> they are definitely not
[20:16:42] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and historically they were buggy af
[20:16:42] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> gotcha
[20:16:47] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so I just stay away with a 10 ft pole
[20:16:48] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> would you use weave instead?
[20:16:56] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and if I need a threadpool or to schedule work across threads I do it myself
[20:17:04] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> ah gotcha
[20:17:08] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I dunno what the status of weave is - the last time I tried to use it, it had way too many issues
[20:17:13] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so I wrote my own fiber based job system for my game engine
[20:17:22] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> i see
[20:17:26] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> using boost context (without the boost)
[20:17:30] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i dont know dude not everyone has the time to do that
[20:17:33] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> for context switching asssembly  routines
[20:17:38] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> again - it's just my advice lol
[20:17:58] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> if you want to deal with Nim's potentially buggy and non-optimal implementations of parallel for and thereadpool be my guess
[20:18:13] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> i feel like i have a decent amount of success with nim thus far. Its concerning to hear people mention poor implementations and buggy stdlib stuff though. It makes me concerned about my codebase : /
[20:18:18] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it's just I went down that road at one point (and admittedly I knew nowhere near as much about concurrency as I do now)
[20:18:22] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> In reply to @Rika "i can compile it": really?  huh
[20:18:28] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and I regretted it
[20:18:33] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @QueenFuckingAdrielle "i feel like i": you will get the same reaction on other languages i would say
[20:18:34] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but Nim's changed alot
[20:18:38] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and maybe the situation has improved
[20:18:44] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> the one thing I'm pretty confident about is this -
[20:18:53] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> Nim's threadpools' scheduler sucks donkey nuts

[20:21:03] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> In reply to @QueenFuckingAdrielle "i still question whether": I mean the concurrency picture in any language like Nim isn't rosy
[20:21:12] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> the fact that Nim has a threadpool implementation in its stdlib is pretty crazy if you think about it
[20:21:20] <FromDiscord> <Rika> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3zQV
[20:21:22] <FromDiscord> <zentoad> huh
[20:21:30] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> because generally the only languages with those higher level constructs are ones that have memory models unlike Nim
[20:21:47] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> In reply to @Rika "because people are talking": There are tradeoffs with any language. We rely on gpu computation quite a bit which is another factor.
[20:22:47] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> Yea we use something like an actor system for the graphs. The overall system is designed for agent-based cognitive architectures.
[20:24:08] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> The benchmarks we've run have consistently outperformed c/gcc and c++/g++ which has been nice
[20:26:55] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> When we switched we looked at julia, crystal, and rust. The only one that was a real contender was julia due to easy c integration and ecosystem.
[20:27:21] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i woulda thought rust was a good one
[20:28:02] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> The issue with rust is that is had many of the cons of just switching completely to c/c++ without many advantages.
[20:28:09] <FromDiscord> <Rika> lol
[20:28:43] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> we have more people familiar with c/c++ than rust so it wouldn't have made sense long term
[20:31:37] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I think Nim is a good choice
[20:31:49] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I mean you're never going to have the safety you get with Rust with Nim
[20:32:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and you're never going to have the memory model to have the concurrency situation that Golang or Erlang or Pony, etc... has
[20:32:22] <FromDiscord> <Rika> well safety isnt what nim is for
[20:32:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah I agree
[20:32:35] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I mean Nim was designed how Nim was designed for a reason
[20:32:48] <FromDiscord> <Rika> In reply to @Gumber "and you're never going": eh why not
[20:32:50] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but I will say this - Andreas Rumpf, the creator of Nim, is one of the smartest people I have ever encountered in my career
[20:33:01] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> because Nim allows threads to share memory
[20:33:03] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> that's why not
[20:33:10] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> erlang and golang etc don't use system threadss
[20:33:10] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> you mean doesn't allow
[20:33:15] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> no it does allow
[20:33:16] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> lol
[20:33:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it doesn't use the actor model or message passing or anything like that
[20:33:27] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and it has a shared heap

[20:33:38] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so threads can touch the same memory with Nim unlike in Golang or Pony or Elixir
[20:33:43] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> where there's just software (green threads)
[20:33:51] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> ah, I'm thinking of the memory model of e.g. Nim 1.2
[20:33:53] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> we tend to favorite processes over threads anyways
[20:33:54] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and no system threads involved besides the single one the runtime is executing on
[20:33:57] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Unfortunately it doesnt solve the issues of temporal validation
[20:34:00] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> are you referring to the memory model of 1.4?
[20:34:07] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I'm referring to all of the memory models
[20:34:15] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> Nim could always share memory between threads
[20:34:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you just had to pass pointers around
[20:34:20] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> or use channels
[20:34:31] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it wasn't an easy thing to make safe
[20:34:38] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> especialy if you had multiple Nim runtimes executing at once on your machine
[20:34:45] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> because they each had their own GC that wasn't aware of the other
[20:34:55] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and if you limited one runtime to have no GC you couldn't use more than half of the stdlib
[20:34:56] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> so in e.g. Nim 1.2, you can't safely read/write re: an object on one thread from a different thread
[20:35:01] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yes you can
[20:35:02] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> you can force it
[20:35:03] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you use channels
[20:35:10] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> channels copy, dude
[20:35:11] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> golang does have system threads in the background for io↵(@Gumber)
[20:35:15] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> Yea idk... i still preferred shared nothing
[20:35:20] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> not if you pass a pointer
[20:35:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you copy the po inter
[20:35:28] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> the underlying memroy  isn't copied

[20:35:34] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> No brain is right; it’s still not safe
[20:35:38] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and you don't even need channels to do that
[20:35:43] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Unless you use locks
[20:35:47] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> or friends
[20:35:47] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> that's right, and do you know what will happen if your program runs long enough?
[20:35:50] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> it’ll still be unsafe
[20:35:53] <FromDiscord> <Rika> well who said anything about safety?
[20:35:55] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah but you cantg schedule work on system threads in userland
[20:35:55] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> and it's not even safe with locks

[20:36:41] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i still dont see why it cant be as "rosy" w/e the fuck you mean by that
[20:36:51] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> because you can schedcule work in userland on system threads
[20:36:55] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> i feel like safety is something you give up with a systems language
[20:36:58] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you can't do that in erlang or pony or golang etc
[20:37:03] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> the runtime does it for you
[20:37:10] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you tell the runtime I want to make this task concurrent
[20:37:20] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> the runtime will schedule the task on a software (green thread)
[20:37:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and use the actor model aka message passing
[20:37:29] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> to achieve memory safety
[20:37:32] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> or relative memory safety
[20:37:33] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> I know rust has made headway with that, but thats not reason enough to use it
[20:37:43] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> in Nim and C and C++ etc
[20:37:44] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you can be like
[20:37:46] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> run this on this system thread
[20:37:54] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and memory doesn't have to be passed in messages or whatever
[20:37:54] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Wheres the lack of safety with locks people
[20:38:01] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I never said there was cabboose
[20:38:04] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> so, in this task runner thing a colleague and I are working on (it's for Nim 1.2, which our organization is stuck on for the time being), we use nim-chronos and AsyncChannel, and do immutable message passing
[20:38:06] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it's just you need to employ locks
[20:38:12] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> or other synchronization primitives
[20:38:18] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> with that structure, we have notion of worker thread, or worker pool
[20:38:20] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> actor/agent programming is the easiest way to make use of a large number of processors. itll be hard to convince me otherwise
[20:38:20] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> not you m8
[20:38:20] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> whereas with golang, pony, erlang etc
[20:38:22] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> brainproxy
[20:38:22] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> works pretty well
[20:38:22] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you don't have tod o any of that
[20:38:23] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> oh
[20:38:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> gotcha
[20:38:38] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> In reply to @QueenFuckingAdrielle "actor/agent programming is the": yeah and then you deal with all the copies 🙂
[20:38:47] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> processors are getting cheaper
[20:38:52] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> if you know what you're doing with locks and atomics and sync primitives
[20:39:09] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and you have a strong mental model and understand of your system, CPU arch, os and os scheduler
[20:39:22] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> yeah status can’t guarantee that
[20:39:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and you understand how code and programs are compiled and executed
[20:39:27] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> therefore it’s a bad idea
[20:39:46] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> then you don't really need to pay for the abstraction of message passing and copying data around everywhere
[20:39:56] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you can just achieve safety by knowing what you're doing
[20:40:00] <FromDiscord> <Rika> what are you two arguing about because from what im reading you're not even talking about the same thing
[20:40:04] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> we are
[20:40:05] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> lol
[20:40:08] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it's all related
[20:40:13] <FromDiscord> <Rika> its related but not the same
[20:40:14] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I just don't think you grok it all Rika
[20:40:22] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it's connected / tangental
[20:40:25] <FromDiscord> <Rika> barely
[20:40:28] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> not at al
[20:40:29] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it's like
[20:40:29] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Are you the chap who ported the code over to the task-runner?↵(@brainproxy)
[20:40:34] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you can design a language to focus on certain things
[20:40:36] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> like safe concurrency
[20:40:38] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> or memory safety
[20:40:46] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> In reply to @cabboose "Are you the chap": which code?
[20:40:46] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> (edit) "like safe ... concurrency" 03added "and easy"
[20:40:53] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but they're all trade offs
[20:40:58] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> the AsyncChannels
[20:41:00] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so while we might appear to be talking about very different things
[20:41:02] <FromDiscord> <Rika> is that not obvious
[20:41:05] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> they're all related because you focus on one and give up another
[20:41:08] <FromDiscord> <brainproxy> In reply to @cabboose "the AsyncChannels": yes
[20:41:17] <FromDiscord> <Rika> who is talking to who
[20:41:18] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so Nim will neve rhave what Rust has
[20:41:22] <FromDiscord> <Rika> is there two conversations or one
[20:41:25] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> unless it is redesigned
[20:41:30] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I'm talking to you
[20:41:32] <FromDiscord> <Rika> no
[20:41:34] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> lol
[20:41:37] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> Nim will never have what golang is
[20:41:38] <FromDiscord> <Rika> whatever
[20:41:39] <FromDiscord> <QueenFuckingAdrielle> this is hilarious
[20:41:39] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> (edit) "is" => " has"
[20:41:40] <FromDiscord> <Rika> i dont care anymore
[20:41:42] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> unless it is redesigned
[20:41:43] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> okay
[20:42:34] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Well why not do this
[20:42:40] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> have a couple thousand threads
[20:42:43] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> a fast MPMC lock free
[20:42:48] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> and just toss everything at it
[20:43:01] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> with memory assurance by cache line invalidation of refs passed through
[20:43:08] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> go nuts
[20:43:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yup
[20:43:21] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I lke it
[20:43:23] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> (edit) "lke" => "like"
[20:43:43] *** Joins: SebastianM (~seba@user/sebastianm)
[20:43:54] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> this is a mans man
[20:43:57] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I'll probably just end using though... https://gametechdev.github.io/GTS-GamesTaskScheduler/documentation/html/index.html
[20:44:04] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and not do the work myself
[20:44:48] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Oooo that’s actually a really useful link
[20:44:49] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> cheers
[20:45:23] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> sure thing bud!
[20:45:50] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I’m in the process of writing a cache invalidation operation for refs passed through loony so hopefully we can get some speedy concurrency going on in nim
[20:46:01] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> always nice to have more folks with deeer threading and concurrency knowledge in the community
[20:46:08] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> (edit) "deeer" => "deeper"
[20:46:10] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Although we’re kind of just doing it for cps
[20:46:11] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> we've lacked that for a LONG time
[20:46:30] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> Eh, cps might end up being the future
[20:46:39] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> especially since some of the most talented devs in the community are building around it
[20:46:45] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I’ve had to learn it because I’m the gimp in charge of implementing it  \:’)
[20:46:50] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so I'm excited to see where it goes - I don't have time to work on it / contribute to it
[20:47:00] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but I'm going to use it if it makes it into mainline
[20:47:02] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> for sure
[20:47:11] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and also I'll need it all to support the cpp backend 😉
[20:47:28] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> hahahaha thats haxscrampers job
[20:47:31] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> xD
[20:48:17] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> In reply to @cabboose "I’ve had to learn": I had to learn it all because for years everyone in this community had no idea how the F to write a multithreaded program in Nim that didn't deadlock / sigsev
[20:48:26] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> beyond little toy examples of things
[20:48:40] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> the only people that knew or understood were like Araq and others who had no time to explain or teach others
[20:48:58] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so that's when I started down the whole quest / journey of actually learning about these things instead of just trying to rely on them without understanding how they worked
[20:48:59] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Disruptek and zevv made me watch herb sutter \:’)
[20:49:07] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I guess I need to watch that too now...
[20:49:30] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> any recommendations as far as talks by them go?
[20:49:33] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> or reading material?
[20:49:47] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> nah I was just oblivious to how caches worked until they got me into it
[20:49:56] <FromDiscord> <Rika> how do you guys have so much time
[20:49:57] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> dude you already know it hahahaha
[20:50:02] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I'm currently about to start on - https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/ - but prob not till this weekend
[20:50:05] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> ah okay haha
[20:50:13] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I learn quickly if its interesting
[20:50:16] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> same
[20:50:23] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I try to find something that is related to it
[20:50:23] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> and it’s logical once you can find a good resource that actually digs deep enough
[20:50:26] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah
[20:50:32] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> like at first everything makes no sense
[20:50:39] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but then you understand one little piece of the puzzle and then something else clicks
[20:50:48] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and it just goes like that until one day you're like HOLLLY SHITTTT
[20:50:51] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I get this stuff now it all makes sense
[20:50:53] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I actually do have a very good book for you
[20:50:58] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> kind of like my life recently and ADHD xD
[20:51:00] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Delivered from Distraction
[20:51:04] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> it’s by a psychiatrist with ADHD
[20:51:07] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> okay googling now
[20:51:10] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> yip
[20:51:15] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> ah thank you - yeah all the ADHD resources I can use for sure xD
[20:51:47] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> very good read definitely
[20:52:04] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> also since he has it he kind of designs the book to be distraction friendly hahaha
[20:52:17] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> niceeee I'm excited 😄 I can finally read books now
[20:52:21] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and remember things from them
[20:52:40] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I no longer need to buy books with the intention of reading them and then never reading them because my brain won't let me xD
[20:52:58] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and btw I just purchased it and the audible version so I'll start listening to it when I'm driving around or have some spare time. Thank you!
[20:53:18] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> It is a life changing diagnosis as an adult for sure \:)
[20:53:22] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> hahaha that was quick! I know you’ll enjoy it
[20:53:30] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> You’ll have a lot of those “SO TRUE” moments
[20:54:02] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah it's just batshit crazy stuff
[20:54:06] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> like being a baby again
[20:54:14] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> need to learn how to talk to others and stuff
[20:54:30] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it's like being an autist and at the same time not being able to even control your own life
[20:54:51] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I don't pretend to know what being an autist is (because I haven't been diagnosed as one yet) but I def wouldn't be surprised if I was on the spectrum now that I know what I know about ADHD and Autism
[20:55:21] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> going to have to get tested for that soon too
[20:55:41] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Atypical brains get isolated quickly; lack of social interactions or appropriate therapy causes further social deficits and accentuates brain development of ASD/ADHD
[20:55:48] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Not like it matters
[20:55:53] <FromDiscord> <Rika> call me when you two are done
[20:55:55] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> unless its causing you problems
[20:55:57] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> why get labelled
[20:56:27] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah I agree
[20:56:38] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I just want to know so I can know effectivley how to treat it and what therapy I should pursue
[20:56:43] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I don't care about the label at all
[20:56:56] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> for my entire adult life I've been tossed around mental health professionals
[20:57:24] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I was diagnosed as bi-polar type 2, manic depressive, major clinical depression with general anxiety disorder etc
[20:57:47] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I was on and off SSRIs (because I couldn't maintain any routine in my life, much less take medication on a regular cadence) for my entire adult life
[20:57:50] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Yeah I can understand that must have been really difficult wow
[20:57:55] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> at times was prescribed benzos and stuff
[20:57:59] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> that’s quite hectic
[20:58:01] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and like none of that madee things better - it just altered my brain chemstiry
[20:58:10] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and then when I inveitibly got off the anti-depressants
[20:58:23] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I'd have to deal with the crazy ass side effects you experience when you don't wean yourself off them
[20:58:31] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> not to mention the entire time I was self medicating with alcohol and pot
[20:58:46] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so I had the whole stigma and message that I was an alcoholic and drug addict and I needed to gointo AA or ssome other 12 step programs
[20:58:52] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> get rid of all my friends
[20:58:54] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Yeah well fair enough
[20:58:56] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> if you’re dealing with all that then that makes sense
[20:58:58] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> give up the only things that brought me any relief etc
[20:58:59] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah
[20:59:07] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I just want to have all the information now
[20:59:15] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> because like, for once  in my life I have some feeeling of control over things
[20:59:32] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and it's amazing, but like making decisions I've realized requires all the information you can gather and a clear and complete picture of what's happening
[20:59:56] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and since I never unerstood that or had the capacity to make it happen before, it's very important to me now that I do all of this the right way
[21:00:04] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I literally have EVERY symptom of adult ADHD in both disorders
[21:00:10] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so every attention symptom and every hyperactive symptom
[21:00:13] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and all the behavior stuff
[21:00:21] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I just have the attention \:’)
[21:00:26] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so I have the worst possible imaginable ADHD you can have
[21:00:29] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah I think my wife is like that too
[21:00:37] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I found out at 18 if you have the hyperactive stuff
[21:00:41] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Surprised they didnt catch it sooner
[21:00:52] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> since you can't be  a hyper ass 18 year old and get through life
[21:00:58] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> you internalize it and it becomes this feeling of restlessness
[21:01:06] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> which I always told my shrinks and therapists and stuff was anxiety
[21:01:13] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I just didn't know wtf it was
[21:01:24] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Mmmm; the odds of passing college are significantly reduced with undiagnosed ADHD
[21:01:32] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so like three years ago my therapist suggested maybe I was on the spectrum or had an attention disorder
[21:01:36] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah somehow I did it I dunno how
[21:01:44] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> somehow I was making six figures by the age of 21 and I don't know how
[21:01:45] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> and unfortunately you had GAD too so if a psychiatrist isn’t sharp then they don’t pick it up
[21:01:56] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> somehow I managed to keep and maintain and evena dvance my career while abusing the  heck out of pot and booze
[21:02:12] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and now I don't even know what my potential is or how life is going to be
[21:02:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I have to go back to my first memory and reframe everything
[21:02:29] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Probably more ‘measured’ than anything
[21:02:30] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and deal with all the trauma and greif etc that's associated with that process
[21:02:41] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and have all of the more difficult conversations with family friends loved ones etc, including my wife
[21:02:44] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Well congratulations man
[21:02:57] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> because she's only known ADHD zach and not Zach with adderall in his system
[21:02:59] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Oh your wife will enjoy some parts of that book
[21:03:04] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> thanks man, It's the best thing that could have ever happened to me
[21:03:12] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I think she will for sure - esp if she has ADD like I think she does
[21:03:22] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> will try to get her to listen to it together with me 🙂
[21:03:48] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Well there’s parts where the psych talks about the ADHD partner
[21:03:50] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> also glad to not be worrying anymore about constantly dying from drinking eventually
[21:03:53] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> ah okay
[21:03:59] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> and how to deal with the ADHD
[21:04:01] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> etc etc
[21:04:02] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> gtocha
[21:04:06] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> like he works alot of stories into it
[21:04:07] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah we're both learning a lot
[21:04:28] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> that's good - cause yeah I know the behavior and stuff can be very aberrant at first
[21:04:59] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> like she's been weirded out by all of it, which is very much expected and natural
[21:05:16] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so we've had to have conversations about like - I don't know what's playing out and how it's going to shape up
[21:05:30] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and also for me, like it's all new and I don't understand so when something happens or I notice a change I get excited and think it's going to be this way from now on
[21:05:32] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but I don't know that
[21:05:49] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> How long have you been medicated for?
[21:05:51] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so just like, expressing that stuff to her is difficult because she is used to me being this way for so long and now I"m thinking that's not going to be the case anymore
[21:06:04] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I started taking the meds as prescribed in July
[21:06:09] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Because it does “blunt” after a while
[21:06:10] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> but not that bad
[21:06:12] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Ah
[21:06:14] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I got re-prescribe them in May but I was so use dto abusing substances
[21:06:17] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> you’re still in the peak
[21:06:18] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> that like that was my relationship with it at first
[21:06:24] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah I'm very early into this
[21:06:41] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and only in the past two weeks did I collect enough self evidence to start forming some of these connections / thoughts
[21:06:49] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> so yeah, very new and raw and weird atm
[21:06:52] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Hahaha a fun time ahead partner
[21:06:58] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah I'm excited xD
[21:07:16] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> and thank you again - it's very nice to talk to people that can relate or even empathize
[21:07:29] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> because I know it's something where unelss you've been through it or know someone who has
[21:07:34] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it doesn't make a lot of sense
[21:07:50] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Of course; I’d say anytime but maybe in the offtopic, I do enjoy discussing these things.
[21:07:54] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I thought ADD/ADHD were a joke my entire life because of how overprescribed riddilin was when I was akid, and that was kind of the stigma society attached to it
[21:08:04] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Yeah
[21:08:07] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> yeah def - we can wrap this one up - I usually try to talk about it in there 🙂
[21:08:19] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I gotta run to a meeting and stuff though, but good chat and will catch you later!
[21:08:23] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> I told my psych I didn’t have it when he asked me about it because I didn’t want that label
[21:08:28] <FromDiscord> <cabboose> Cya later mate!
[21:15:34] <Zevv> Caboose: how did sutter work out for you?
[21:15:57] <Zevv> are you enlightened?
[22:04:01] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> Has anyone used cmake to build nim projects? I'm specifically interested in handing dynamically generated files
[22:04:25] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> There is a `execute_process/file(GLOB/target_sources`, but this does not handle rebuilding properly

[22:56:48] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> ummm
[22:56:53] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> there was someone @haxscramper ....
[22:56:56] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> let me find them....
[22:57:00] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> @nikki
[22:58:47] <FromDiscord> <nikki> i've done that yep
[22:58:48] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> https://github.com/Kaynato is their github
[22:58:52] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> oh hey niki!
[22:58:54] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> (edit) "niki!" => "nikki!"
[22:59:05] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> good to see you! well in discord anyway 😅
[22:59:15] <FromDiscord> <nikki> https://github.com/nikki93/ng-public
[22:59:19] <nrds> <12R2D299> 4GitHub: 7"<No Description>"
[22:59:28] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I'm Zachary Carter btw
[22:59:31] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> my handle changed
[22:59:33] <FromDiscord> <nikki> the run.sh + CMakeLists.txt is the build setup
[22:59:44] <FromDiscord> <nikki> In reply to @Gumber "I'm Zachary Carter btw": oh hey!!!
[22:59:44] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> well a lot is changing for me lol
[22:59:51] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but uh, that's a longer story
[23:00:14] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> found out I had undiganosed adult adhd at 36
[23:00:31] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> can talk in #offtopic or dms if you're interested but, prob best not for this channel haha - too much of that happened earlier today already xD
[23:01:36] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> but I hope life is good with you 🙂 haven't chatted much lately - I know you stay busy!
[23:02:23] <FromDiscord> <nikki> ooh i tried to dm you but i think it's friends only and sent a friend req which i think you're not accepting 😅
[23:02:40] *** Joins: Gustavo6046 (~Gustavo60@user/gustavo6046)
[23:03:15] <FromDiscord> <nikki> In reply to @Gumber "but I hope life": it's good! i've been writing a go (my own very specific subset + metaprogramming lol) to c++. inspired by some stuff from nim fosho
[23:03:41] <FromDiscord> <nikki> go stdlib has a good parser and typechecker for it which helps headstart and they just added generics which i parse and generate c++ templates
[23:03:49] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3zRH
[23:03:52] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> oh nice
[23:03:58] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> are you doing the same memory model?
[23:04:04] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> sent a code paste, see https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=3zRI
[23:04:10] <FromDiscord> <nikki> i was going to keep it explicit or raii
[23:04:16] <FromDiscord> <nikki> not really reference and gc heavy
[23:04:17] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I like that
[23:04:22] <FromDiscord> <haxscramper> It does have enough integration with qtcreator, though still not ideal wrt. to rebuilding
[23:04:23] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> system threads?
[23:04:49] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> is this like a C replacement basically then? Kind of like Zig? but more focused on metaprogramming too?
[23:05:13] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> because Go strives to be simple like C for the most part I think
[23:05:18] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> it just like focuses on the concurrency story mostly
[23:05:18] <FromDiscord> <nikki> kinda like zig tbh
[23:05:21] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> niceee
[23:05:22] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> this sounds really cool
[23:05:27] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> please keep me / us updated!
[23:05:28] <FromDiscord> <nikki> i like the pure structs + adding methods from outside paradigm
[23:05:31] <FromDiscord> <nikki> will do!
[23:05:51] <FromDiscord> <nikki> https://gist.github.com/nikki93/37256c81766d4b8806aaa6cf2195b00d?ts=2
[23:06:02] <FromDiscord> <nikki> entire current state of compiler and example input and output haha
[23:06:43] <FromDiscord> <nikki> In reply to @haxscramper "For now I ended": interesting i see
[23:06:58] <FromDiscord> <nikki> yeah i end up always using an external script to run my cmake so have been ok with doing it at that level
[23:07:27] <FromDiscord> <nikki> In reply to @Gumber "it just like focuses": yea going to just not do any concurrency initially
[23:09:50] <FromDiscord> <nikki> (or probably ever lol unless someone uses it for sth that wants that -- i want to just do gameplay programming against an ecs with it (don't we all in this discord))
[23:10:56] <FromDiscord> <nikki> @Gumber add me btw if you wanna chat about this more! (i can't add you 😶)
[23:14:34] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> gotcha
[23:14:37] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> ah okay
[23:14:51] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> did you get the request @nikki ?
[23:19:24] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> I tried sending you a message via our existing DM but it didn't work 😦
[23:19:34] <FromDiscord> <Gumber> guess we have to be friends
[23:28:55] <FromDiscord> <nikki> yup got it!
