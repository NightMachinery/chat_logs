[15:05:20] <Czernobog> I am getting: /msg is not a registered nickname 
[15:05:36] <Czernobog> i added this to NickServ in znc: /msg *nickserv SetCommand IDENTIFY IDENTIFY USERNAME PASSWORD
[15:05:41] <Czernobog> is this wrong?
[15:12:36] <DarthGandalf> why would you do such thing?
[15:14:00] <Czernobog> DarthGandalf, sorry, I don't exactly know how to use the command
[15:14:12] <Czernobog> that's why I am asking
[15:14:34] <DarthGandalf> why do you need that command at all?
[15:15:02] <Czernobog> To login in to irc? is there an easier way?
[15:15:02] <DarthGandalf> what network is that for?
[15:15:09] <Czernobog> Libera.Chat
[15:15:20] <DarthGandalf> /msg *status unloadmod nickserv
[15:15:25] <DarthGandalf> /msg *status loadmod sasl
[15:15:29] <DarthGandalf> and follow [[sasl]]
[15:15:29] <ZNC-Linker> https://wiki.znc.in/sasl
[15:16:15] <Czernobog> what does unloading do?
[15:16:35] <DarthGandalf> *nickserv SetCommand is only useful in very obscure cases: when the network doesn't support sasl, and the nickserv doesn't accept the standard way of logging in
[15:16:37] <MetaNova> unloadmod unloads the specified module
[15:17:03] <MetaNova> Czernobog: not only is DarthGandalf correct ^ in that you want to use SASL wherever available, that's the wrong usage of SetCommand
[15:17:18] <Czernobog> I see. 
[15:17:38] <Czernobog> You guys will have to walk me through this because this is very very confusing for me
[15:17:54] <MetaNova> Czernobog: your NickServ account is Czernobog
[15:17:59] <MetaNova> thus, you would: /msg *status loadmod sasl
[15:18:11] <MetaNova> then: /msg *sasl set Czernobog <your NickServ password>
[15:18:14] <MetaNova> that's it
[15:19:33] <Czernobog> MetaNova, That will go in the NickServ Box correct?
[15:19:50] <MetaNova> box? just type what I typed
[15:20:32] <Czernobog> okay done
[15:20:39] <DarthGandalf> what nickserv box??
[15:20:49] <MetaNova> the query window, I imagine
[15:20:57] <Czernobog> I thought the command would be typed in the znc nickserv
[15:21:32] <MetaNova> Czernobog: if you are addressing a command to the nick/module is belongs to, such as '/msg *status unloadmod nickserv' it does not matter where you type it
[15:21:47] <Czernobog> ohh
[15:22:05] <MetaNova> if your command were only "unloadmod nickserv" you would have to type it in the *status query: /query *status
[15:22:33] <MetaNova> IRC clients handle private messages, often, in their own tabs/windows/"queries" as it is generally known
[15:22:59] <MetaNova> it's the same difference between "/msg MetaNova hi" and "/query MetaNova" and then "hi"
[15:24:10] <Czernobog> okay I see.
[15:24:39] <Czernobog> Now it says username has set to [USERNAME]
[15:24:43] <Czernobog> and same for password
[15:25:10] <Czernobog> is this it?
[15:25:30] <MetaNova> Czernobog: the credentials you need to specify are your NickServ accountname (or any grouped nick) and your NickServ password
[15:25:43] <MetaNova> NickServ IDENTIFY, and SASL authentication, log you into the same system
[15:25:51] <MetaNova> they are just different mechanisms for doing so
[15:26:02] <MetaNova> they are the same account, and take the same credentials
[15:26:08] <MetaNova> thus: <MetaNova> then: /msg *sasl set Czernobog <your NickServ password>
[15:27:35] <Czernobog> Yes, I get it. They are different authentication for logging in to my account, right?
[15:27:41] <MetaNova> yes
[15:29:22] <Czernobog> '/msg *sasl set Czernobog <your NickServ password>' after I input this, does this mean that if I restart my client it will log me back in automatically?
[15:29:47] <MetaNova> the *sasl module is for making ZNC authenticate to services if it ever reconnects
[15:30:08] <MetaNova> between these times, your client can attach/detach to ZNC as many times as it pleases and you will remain logged in
[15:30:58] <Czernobog> okay so you're telling me that even if my znc is down I will stay logged in
[15:31:59] <MetaNova> no, ZNC needs to remain connected
[15:32:23] <Czernobog> okay
[15:32:33] <MetaNova> if you configure the *sasl module properly, however, ZNC will make sure NickServ sees you as identified whenever it connects
[15:32:50] <MetaNova> your client no longer handles any identification/authentication except for logging into ZNC
[15:32:58] <MetaNova> ZNC now handles the rest, including NickServ/SASL auth
[15:33:15] <Czernobog> I see.
[15:33:16] <MetaNova> your client logs into ZNC, ZNC logs you into your "Czernobog" account
[15:33:24] <MetaNova> think of ZNC as your secretary
[15:33:27] <Czernobog> Got it!
[15:34:20] <Czernobog> What about mobile client? I will have to configure it as well to work with sasl
[15:34:26] <MetaNova> No.
[15:34:53] <Czernobog> I will have to configure it to connect to ZNC?
[15:35:05] <MetaNova> you configure SASL auth for your ZNC user/network once, and then any client (mobile, desktop, laptop, it doesn't matter) will be "identified" already
[15:35:28] <MetaNova> Czernobog: yes, you will need to configure additional clients to connect to ZNC, if you wanted to use additional clients with ZNC

[15:36:09] <MetaNova> if you intend on going down this route, please reference properly configuring multiclient support at https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_clients#Full_overview
[15:36:26] <MetaNova> the bare minimum is steps 1 and 2
[15:36:44] <MetaNova> but 1-5 is recommended
[15:37:44] <Czernobog> hmmm this seems like a hassle. Since I am the only one using it and I have 2 clients I feel like it's not worth it lol but I want to learn so I will 
[15:38:13] <MetaNova> you will certainly want to do steps 1 and 2 if you use more than one client, I suspect
[15:38:30] <MetaNova> but you can simply do as you intended and see if it suits you
[15:40:22] <Czernobog> I will go through it and see what I can do and ask here if I am not able to solve something

[16:20:02] <MetaNova> Nacorid: IIRC, "invalid argument" is when you try to mix IPv6 and IPv4
[16:20:19] <MetaNova> Nacorid: please show the output from "/msg *status listservers" and "/msg *status showbindhost"

[16:21:52] <MetaNova> vengeful.eu has an A and AAAA records
[16:21:56] <Nacorid> Yeah
[16:22:18] <MetaNova> meaning ZNC should be trying to connect to irc.libera.chat via 2a0b:bbc0::54 and 185.107.195.58

[17:14:23] <Anarethos> Hi everyone! Just completed my installation of ZNC yesterday. First time using Docker for a real thing. First time using an IRC bouncer. Wow. How to transform an old technology to modern time. I means, having push notification (Palaber) from IRC is something cool.
[17:14:53] <MetaNova> o/
[17:14:56] <Anarethos> Still, I have a question. I have enable server-wide logging. Is ther anyway to read the log directly from IRC or I must read the log ficle from the filesystem only ?
[17:15:34] <MetaNova> Anarethos: there was a module, weblog, which was alpha/testing in phase
[17:15:40] <MetaNova> it was not stable
[17:16:04] <MetaNova> there is currently no "official" way to do this, but there are options
[17:16:08] <MetaNova> [[Backlog]] is one
