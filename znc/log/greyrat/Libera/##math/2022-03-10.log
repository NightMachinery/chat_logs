[00:10:24] <blackfield> somiaj, well sigma algebra is also closed under countable union, in addition to being algebra of sets
[00:10:54] <somiaj> Ahh, I guess I'm only use to working with sigma algebras
[00:12:00] <somiaj> ahh I see, algebra of sets only allows finite operations not countable operations.
[00:13:48] <somiaj> My first assumption on this proof is start by assuming it is not finite, and then start trying to construct a infinite number of pairwise disjoint sets.
[00:14:33] <somiaj> Or maybe show that for any finite collection of pairwise disjoint memebers you can always construct a new member that is not in this collection. To me this seems to be enough to say there must be an infinite number.

[03:10:23] <jbis> Hi. Question about function compositions. What are the restrictions on what functions you can compose?
[03:10:37] <jbis> Relating to domains and codomains
[03:11:25] <joel135> in type theory they have to be identical
[03:12:13] <jbis> "type theory"?
[03:12:46] <joel135> in (non-structural) set theory the codomain of the first may have to be a subset of the domain of the second; otherwise you will have to restrict the domain of the composite function to be a proper subset of the domain of the first function
[03:12:55] <jmorris> jbis: say f : A -> B and g : C -> D
[03:13:12] <jmorris> what restrictions do you impose on A,B,C,D for g(f(x)) to make sense
[03:13:36] <jmorris> we know f(x) \in B

[03:15:49] <jmorris> no
[03:15:50] <joel135> in this case "you will have to restrict the domain of the composite function"
[03:15:57] <jmorris> (A,1) != (1,A)
[03:16:58] <jbis> wdym by that? can i compose it or no? I would assume that if you are allowed to the domain would become 1 and codomain A
[03:17:03] <joel135> f(g(2)) is undefined
[03:17:24] <joel135> that is correct

[03:21:11] <jbis> It is yes

[03:21:29] <joel135> (1) expand the definitions
[03:21:45] <joel135> (2) the fact that "f is one-to-one" is a red herring
[03:22:52] <jbis> My example was the following. f = {(A, 1)}, g = {(1, A), (2, B), (3, B)}, f o g = {(1, 1)}. f and fog are one-to-one, g is not.

[03:23:43] <joel135> ok that's a good point
[03:24:28] <joel135> it is a matter of convention whether to allow this composition, and the convention actually determines whether the statement is true or not

[05:19:16] <Fangs> (otherwise if they just come from some random set you might not know how to add them together)
[05:19:21] <PlanckWalk> Yep, it's basically just defining equivalences between the various u(x)v's
[05:19:23] <laurus> Fangs: why do I feel like there's more to this than meets the eye. For example, I've seen the "kronecker product" used with vectors in R^n and it seems to have a very specific definition, i.e. here's exactly what the kronecker product  of two vectors looks like

[05:22:31] <PlanckWalk> It's just given a symbol
[05:23:37] <Fangs> laurus: if you wonder why the definition for tensor product is given as such, you should look up hom-tensor adjunction
[05:23:41] <PlanckWalk> (or tuple in general)

[05:24:17] <tusko> If we have a sum of periodic functions, each with fundamental period w0, w1, ..., wk, don't we require that LCM(w0, w1, ..., wk) is rational for the sum to be periodic?

[05:58:08] <laurus> PlanckWalk: what would that matrix look like?
[05:59:20] <PlanckWalk> ... like any other sort of matrix thing?
[05:59:28] <PlanckWalk> A rectangle with scalars in it
[05:59:43] <laurus> PlanckWalk: But U \otimes V isn't any kind of representation of a linear transformation

[06:08:36] <PlanckWalk> For ordered bases (u_1, ..., u_m) of U and (v_1, ..., v_n) of V, each u_i(x)v_j is represented as a matrix with a 1 at position (i,j) and zeroes elsewhere.
[06:08:56] <PlanckWalk> So any element of U(x)V is represented by any matrix
[06:09:19] <laurus> Oh I see. That assumes that the bases are finite
[06:09:26] <laurus> But so did my result for linear transformations as well come to think of it
[06:09:27] <PlanckWalk> Yes, just like linear transformations.

[07:32:50] <monkeyPlus> y
[07:32:53] <Cale> I don't get what you're asking
[07:32:56] <monkeyPlus> me neither
[07:33:02] <monkeyPlus> since C/2 = 3 ?!
[07:33:08] <monkeyPlus> C/2 integer = even
[07:33:19] <Cale> huh, why should it be?
[07:33:26] <monkeyPlus> because its divded by 2
[07:33:31] <Cale> C should be even
[07:33:37] <Cale> C/2 needn't be
[07:33:54] <monkeyPlus> sorry but if C is even so is C/2
[07:33:59] <Cale> false
[07:34:05] <Cale> 2 is even, but 2/2 = 1 is not
[07:34:42] <monkeyPlus> but the definition of even numbers, is that they are divisible by two
[07:34:48] <Batzy> <Cale> 2 is even, but 2/2 = 1 is not
[07:34:53] <Batzy> whens the paper gettin published
[07:35:12] <Cale> Just because a number is divisible by 2, does not mean that dividing it by 2 produces another number which is divisible by 2
[07:35:40] <Cale> If that were the case, every even number would have to be infinitely large or something, because you can divide any power of two out of it
[07:35:59] <Batzy> i actually see beginner programmers make this sort of mistake a lot Cale
[07:36:13] <Batzy> if i tell them "print me how the even numbers between 1 and 10000"
[07:36:36] <Batzy> I've seen people try like if i/2 is even or something
[07:37:00] <Batzy> or i/2 is some certain value, whatever (it doesn't work so obviously what im saying makes no sense)(
[07:37:05] <somiaj> monkeyPlus: The definition only says the number is divisble by two, it doesn't say that the result is also even. n is even if n/2 is another integer (which could be even or odd)

[07:38:06] <somiaj> sure, but 12 is also even, because 12/2 = 6 is an intger.
[07:38:18] <monkeyPlus> but 6 is even
[07:38:21] <somiaj> the definition just states that dividing na even number by two generates another integer
[07:38:27] <monkeyPlus> hhmhmh
[07:38:28] <somiaj> sure but 10 is also even because 10/2 = 5 is an integer

[10:23:00] <greenbagels> So it's clear that there are different classifications for measures, like Borel, Radon, Caratheodory, etc, and they each offer different options for what sets are measurable and which sets have identical measure
[10:23:42] <greenbagels> How common is it for contemporary analysis work to introduce new slightly different or more specific measures?

[10:27:41] <greenbagels> My impression was that using different types of measure at the same time can let you probe how a sets "size" appears from different viewpoints, like how two sets with identical lebesgue measure may have differing Hausdorff measures

[10:34:42] <kado> for me, the usefulness of lebesgue theory is in what it says about the riemann

[10:39:55] <kado> there's a theorem by riesz (one of the "represention theorems") that says that on a certain topological spaces (e.g. smooth manifolds), if you know how to integrate continuous functions with compact support, then you get a measure which allows to integrate bigger class of functions.

[10:52:12] <kado> that's a completely different point of view from the one which leads from outer measure to measure. it requires more structure (a locally compact topological space, i think), but it's something that is satisfied in R^n, and also leads to lesbesgue measure. you can find this point of view early on in one

[15:22:06] <Smilex> Fangs, Thanks! so to show that they are closed, do I somehow prove that by multiplying two complex numbers, they never get a j or k element?
[15:22:27] *** Joins: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda)
[15:22:41] <Fangs> you can do that yeah
[15:22:43] <Smilex> I mean, the complex numbers famously rotate on the plane when multiplied, right? So it seems obvious that they are closed under multiplication. I just don't know how to prove it
[15:23:39] <Decker> they're also scaled to infinity if you don't bother to rotate - it's only closed in 1 of its degrees
[15:23:53] <Fangs> let a,b,c,d be real numbers. if you multiply (a+bi)(c+di) you can find x and y real numbers so that (a+bi)(c+di) = (x+yi)
[15:25:35] <Smilex> Decker, but aren't you misusing the term "closed" here? They might be infinite, but they don't "jump" to a higher space. Or am I wrong?
[15:26:29] <Decker> Smilex probably; I've seen it more like a line is open and a circle is closed - though they both can represent infinities
[15:27:08] <Smilex> Fangs, well x = (ac - bd) and y = (ad + bc), but I don't see how that proves anything?

[18:02:12] <isekaijin> My professor just claimed the following. Let X be a topological space and {U_i} a finite open cover of X, such that \bigcap_i U_i has trivial Cech cohomology in every degree p > 0. Then the Cech and sheaf cohomology groups of X are isomorphic.

[18:09:20] <Galois> sorry, Theorem III.4.5
[18:10:25] <Galois> you know what, that seems unlikely to be the case, because you're talking about topological spaces, whereas Hartshorne does schemes. But maybe that proof will give you some ideas.

[21:20:58] <somiaj> Maybe go with my second suggestion
[21:21:16] <somiaj> So you have an infinite algebra A = { A_i : i in I, A_i subset X }

[21:23:00] <somiaj> Show you can create a B_(n+1) that is pairwise disjoint (and not empty) from B_1,...,B_n. Then this means that every finite set of pairwise disjoint subsets cannot be of maximial size. Thus there has to be an infinte collection

[21:25:44] <somiaj> blackfield: I do think directly constructing such a set maybe a bit difficult. What happens if for some reason the first set you start out with is say A = X\{x} a single point. Then it won't be possible to generate an infinite collection of pairwise disjoint sets. This would also be true if you had A_1 = X/{x1,x2,...,xn} (all except a finite number of elements of X)
[21:26:01] <somiaj> so to construct this infinte set you'll have to do lots of checks on the sets you choose to use from A
[21:26:45] <blackfield> say A_i is subset of B_i, for finite number that's okay.. and it will only happen for infinitely many if X appears :D
