[08:09:31] <catbeard> i consistently have 20-30ms ping
[08:09:41] <catbeard> to 1.1.1.1 anyway
[08:09:59] <catbeard> i don't have the server hostnames to monitor the direct latency
[08:10:01] <JollyRgrs> when i've been able to trace the servers (this was pre-epic) it most often happened at vultr hosting
[08:10:12] <JollyRgrs> i got a few... if the IPs haven't changed...
[08:10:13] <catbeard> oh yeah vultr is maint all the time
[08:10:16] <JollyRgrs> now they mask it a bit more
[08:10:28] <JollyRgrs> just go to performance monitor under networking and tick rocketleague.exe
[08:10:35] <catbeard> just rl doesn't disclose vultr's maintenance events always

[08:14:18] <catbeard> yeah not all locations offer deedaws protection
[08:15:11] <catbeard> does RL at least announce their own range, or do they just use the provider-assigned IP
[08:15:32] <catbeard> and chuck an A record into a RR
[08:16:06] <catbeard> or do you know the domain name it uses, could just pull passive dns history
[08:16:49] <catbeard> and maybe CT history, so i can make my own RL server live status checking page :}
[08:21:29] <JollyRgrs> catbeard: from what i can tell just provider IP
[08:21:47] <JollyRgrs> so depends on the datacenter as to what it looks like
[08:21:47] <catbeard> well if you see any rdns for those ips
[08:21:55] <catbeard> or a common domain it uses
[08:22:16] <JollyRgrs> catbeard: i have smokeping running at home and add game servers as i need to keep an eye on how the health looks... RL just makes it a bit harder

[08:33:11] <sd> 05<H​BK> Hi all i have a question, Recently brought a local brand tv off the store as advertised as 4K UHD 3840 x 2160 Resolution, something was odd when i turn on the tv and all my connected devices such as android box ,PS4 shows as 1080P FHD !
[08:33:12] <sd> 05<H​BK> so i ignored it and tried gamming on my PS4 and found out that when HDR kicks in the colour of the TV becomes dull and yellowish ! and i checked the sound n video settings of my PS4 and it was on 1080P i cant change to anything hire. Original cables from PS4, i have used all along to game on my 43 Inch Samsung TV on 4K settings and resolution of 3840 x 2160.
[08:33:12] <sd> 05<H​BK> TV settings is on HDMI 2.0 everything seems fine but the resolution does not look good could it be a faulty panel ?
[08:34:02] <catbeard> are you using a HDMI 2.0 cable?
[08:34:10] <sd> 05<H​BK> i used DRM info to check the tv resolution an i was shocked to find out that it was 1920 x  1080 ( Since its an Android TV )
[08:34:13] <xe0n> ps4 is 1080?
[08:34:23] <sd> 05<H​BK> yeah 2.0 cable
[08:34:36] <sd> 05<H​BK> !
[08:34:47] <sd> 05<H​BK> ps4 can go up to 4K 60fps
[08:34:51] <xe0n> can it? cool
[08:35:11] <catbeard> any options on the tv menu to force 4k?
[08:35:29] <xe0n> have you got something else 4k that you can plug into it and see if it works as expected?
[08:35:30] <sd> 05<H​BK> so i checked my Android tv with some applications like DRM info and AIDA64 and found out the tv resolution is only 1920 x 1080
[08:35:51] <sd> 05<H​BK> yep tried my laptop to tv via HDMI i cant go anything above 1920 x 1080

[15:58:07] <ender> the only time this won't work is if the source and destination SSDs have different size physical sectors (though you're unlikely to get SSD with 4k native sectors in consumer space without doing a nvme format yourself)

[22:02:34] <Sousapro> Morning A-KO 
[22:04:12] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> quick question:
[22:04:12] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> I want to access LAN1 via VPN but don't have a static IP on WAN1, I do however have a static IP on WAN2
[22:04:12] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> is it possible to basically use a VPN on LAN2 on WAN2 as jumphost to LAN1 if I have a server on LAN1 connected to that VPN on LAN2 ?
[22:04:12] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> 
[22:04:12] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> I'd need to basically have the VPN server on LAN2 and the connected server on LAN1 act as router. is this doable?
[22:04:15] <Sousapro> sideup66: I love my old ThinkPad gear but they've gotten to the point where they aren't that much more repairable than anything else. Basically all they've got is trackpoint which I wish they would just FRAND license out to everyone 
[22:05:15] <Sousapro> Ozymandias42: why not just use an A record paired with a dynamic DNS solution on WAN1? 
[22:05:31] <Sousapro> I run a home VPN server that runs really well that way
[22:05:55] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> I don't want dynamic DNS
[22:06:11] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> I know that that is an option too but I want to know if my alternate method works too
[22:06:30] <Sousapro> The answer is it depends then
[22:06:51] <Sousapro> Depends on how LAN1 to LAN2 routing works
[22:07:15] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> they can't route directly. they are separate
[22:07:24] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> hence why I need a VPN between them as bridge
[22:07:40] <Sousapro> So you're asking if two subnets that aren't allowed to talk can talk? 
[22:07:45] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> yes
[22:08:00] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> by using an outside device both can reach as gateway
[22:08:41] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> if I could host the VPN server directly on LAN1 this would be a non issue but the dynamic DNS requirement makes that point moot.
[22:08:52] <Sousapro> Depends on your routing table. This is getting complicated for a workaround to dynamic DNS
[22:08:58] <sideup66> Sousapro: yeah the loss of the socketed cpu sucks
[22:09:08] <Sousapro> sideup66: and soldered ram
[22:09:16] <sideup66> I've yet to encounter that
[22:09:20] <Sousapro> Sideup66: so they are now all time bombs 
[22:09:25] <sideup66> My work one is a 490 and ram is not soldered
[22:09:35] <sideup66> And old 450 they retired is replaceable
[22:09:38] <Sousapro> sideup66: the newer T series are sometimes now. Maybe they backed off 
[22:09:40] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> I tried writing a routing table for that using the `ip` command but only got to being able to talk to the IP of the device connected to the VPN in LAN1 but not any other
[22:09:47] <sideup66> I think they backed off when everyone. Complained

[22:10:37] <Sousapro> If it's ThinkPads, those will go quickly on ebay
[22:10:39] <sideup66> But I wanted a retro console setup, and one of the things going is a CRT monitor from the early 2000ands
[22:11:01] <sideup66> I'm wondering how the converters will work and if they solve the lag problems
[22:11:09] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> another option I consider is a nested VPN. so first I make a tunnel originating from LAN2 on WAN2 that makes the second VPN server on LAN1 reachable.
[22:11:09] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> then I connect to that one over the address of WAN2 and I'm in.
[22:11:15] <sideup66> Run audio to an old Bose speaker I got for dree
[22:12:05] <sideup66> And it may be fine
[22:12:08] <Sousapro> Ozymandias42: that's going to be a pain but probably possible depending on how your site to site VPN is configured 
[22:12:28] <sideup66> I had a old sony Trinitron that literally fell apart in the move
[22:12:47] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> I think that will work. I just have to keep an ssh tunnel with portforwarding for the port of the second vpn open on LAN2.

[22:19:21] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> that's irrelevant though because I do not have access to the routers / switches there.
[22:19:40] <Sousapro> Oh wow
[22:20:02] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> so basically LAN1 is NATed all the way out of WAN1 and WAN2 but I have no access to the routers connected to either of them
[22:21:43] <Sousapro> Legitimate question: why are you trying to do this? 
[22:22:13] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> because it is easier and faster for me to solve it that way than to wait for someone else to solve it on the levels I don't have access to

[22:22:29] <Sousapro> Not a great idea

[22:27:51] <Sousapro> Right is tagged with a vlan natively at the switch stack unless they have literally separate switches

[22:29:13] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> I don't think they do. ..actually that subnet is created by the loadbalancer which goes directly into the outer LANs.

[22:32:53] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> and using VLAN for that might not be what I want because the whole point of using macvlan would be to have the containers appear "natively" in the chosen network

[22:49:50] <A-KO> containers?

[22:50:21] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> docker but maybe k8s in future
[22:50:35] <A-KO> yeah those things aren't designed to be run natively on the network like that
[22:50:40] <A-KO> the entire paradigm is built around nat
[22:50:51] <A-KO> like literally nat is a core component of k8s

[22:54:04] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> that's usually the case but there are use-cases for giving containers directly reachable addresses.

[22:55:02] <signalblue> can't seem to figure this out
[22:55:30] <sd> 12<O​zymandias42> the usual way to use docker containers is by port-forwarding the port that is intended to be reachable to either the adress of the host or via overlay and ingress to the port on all adresses on the cluster. both options couple that port to the adress of the endpoint however and do not make the container appear as it's own server on the network
[22:55:55] <signalblue> Sousapro: it's totally possible to do that
[22:56:50] <Sousapro> signalblue: to do what? 
[22:57:10] <signalblue> implement WG and IPsec without end-user assistance
[22:57:22] <signalblue> but I've never done it myself
[22:57:50] <Sousapro> signalblue: oh yeah, almost anything is possible with enough determination

[23:00:36] <signalblue> lol
[23:00:40] <Sousapro> Scored a fast 2tb u.2 for under $200 with almost no wear. Prices jumped up after folks figured out you could just use a m.2 to u.2 adapter cable lol
[23:01:04] <A-KO> speaking of drives and stuff
[23:01:09] <A-KO> I should really replace my CPU cooler

[23:01:42] <signalblue> Sousapro: that is really funny LOL
[23:02:02] <signalblue> Intel branded I assume
[23:02:07] <A-KO> so I'm running a Corsair H100i v2 on my Ryzen 9 3900X. It "works" ; but not super well. When running Prime95 my CPU temp can easily hit 85C
[23:02:31] <Sousapro> Ouch yeah. May want to look into a 360 radiator based cooler 
[23:02:32] <A-KO> I keep doing some reading and realize that my CPU is actually running hotter than it should, which affects its performance and boost clocks
[23:02:33] <signalblue> A-KO: just get a mac... it's designed for idiots
[23:03:00] <A-KO> Sousapro: Don't think I can fit a 360 in here tbh, so I'm likely going 280 ; NZXT Kraken either X63 or Z63
[23:03:09] <A-KO> depending on if I want the mirror thing or the fancy ass LCD lol
[23:03:12] <Sousapro> A-KO: consider doing custom watercooling with soft tubing. 
[23:03:20] <signalblue> i'm joking btw
[23:03:23] <Sousapro> It's way less of a pita then it used to be
[23:03:33] <A-KO> AMD's CPUs are super sensitive to cooling performance
[23:03:49] <signalblue> and RAM speeds to a lesser extent
[23:03:56] <Sousapro> Yeah they'll keep going until they hit a limit
[23:04:04] <Sousapro> Especially with PBO enabled 
[23:04:12] <signalblue> then it's just diminishing returns
[23:04:20] <A-KO> yeah, my ram is reasonably fine for now. It's 3200. I could get a benefit out of going 3600 ; but it gets harder to find compatible, higher capacity ram with low latency at those speeds
[23:04:35] <signalblue> overclock it if it supports it
[23:04:43] <A-KO> The most compatibility and highest capacity with lowest latency sweet spot is 3200 on my board
[23:04:50] <A-KO> I start making trade offs to go higher
[23:04:55] <A-KO> to go 4000? We're talking 8GB modules
[23:04:58] <A-KO> and maybe 2 of them
[23:04:59] <A-KO> F that noise
[23:05:00] <A-KO> lol
[23:05:07] <Sousapro> I'd always go for tighter timings over high clock
[23:05:33] <Sousapro> Especially since you'll start having issues above 3600mhz with infinity fabric 
[23:05:35] <A-KO> well that's the issue. 3600 has low timings, but you suffer on capacity and compatibility. The other thing is 2 vs 4 modules
[23:06:03] <A-KO> right now I'm stuck on 2 modules unless I ditch my entire ram because the ram isn't compatible with being in 4 module mode in my board. I had to pull 2 sticks out, and it's long beyond returning the ram so
[23:06:09] <A-KO> I have to basically ebay the extra 2
[23:06:22] <Sousapro> That sucks :(
[23:06:38] <Sousapro> I went Threadripper but it's a trade off with memory latency 
[23:06:46] <Sousapro> I'm rocking 64gb of ram in quad channel 
[23:06:58] <signalblue> that's awesome
[23:07:06] <signalblue> 64gb is honestly overkill for me though
[23:07:18] <A-KO> yeah. I had tons of really odd behaviors on 4 sticks. Finally dug out memtest and one of the tests *finally* found the issue. Took 2 out? No errors, no problems. No weird behaviors anymore. Looked at the memory HCL ; and it's totally called out on there
[23:07:21] <A-KO> and I'm an idiot for not reading it
[23:07:45] <A-KO> so DDR4 with XMP essentially sucks
[23:08:01] <signalblue> remember the days of triple channel ram?
[23:08:03] <A-KO> it works, it's fast ; but it's riding some edge of quality
[23:08:08] <signalblue> back in the haswell days
[23:08:18] <A-KO> indeed
[23:08:20] <Sousapro> Yeah especially since you're running a dual channel motherboard 
[23:08:26] <signalblue> 12GB ram was pretty common
[23:08:45] <A-KO> best part? All of the modules work fine by themselves. I tested every slot. I tested every module. I tested pairs of modules. The only time I got errors was when all 4 were in there.
[23:08:46] <signalblue> 4GBx3
[23:08:57] <signalblue> A-KO: bad board?
[23:09:01] <A-KO> nope, board's fine
[23:09:06] <A-KO> it's just an HCL thing
[23:09:09] <A-KO> they literally call it out as not working
[23:09:10] <A-KO> lol
[23:09:19] <signalblue> that's a super super edge case imo
[23:09:28] <A-KO> most board makers have such a list
[23:09:34] <signalblue> you just happened to have the wrong ram with the wrong board
[23:09:43] <A-KO> they list 1, 2, 4 module compatibility lists.
[23:09:49] <signalblue> because most of the time even if it's not on the HCL, it works
[23:09:51] <A-KO> and at which speeds and capacities
[23:09:59] <A-KO> yeah, that's what I would figure.
[23:10:04] <signalblue> indeed
[23:10:12] <Sousapro> It's also Zen 2 which is picker than Zen 3 with ram
[23:10:19] <A-KO> But nope, with these modules it's called out on the list as 1, 2 work ; but 4 don't.
[23:10:29] <Sousapro> You want to talk about hell though? Zen 1 Threadripper is awful 
[23:10:39] <A-KO> I think it's a ram vendor thing tbh. It's Corsair ram. Oh that's another thing that's a thing. I want RGB ram because reasons.
[23:10:40] <A-KO> lol
[23:10:50] <A-KO> I could go G.Skill and actually get 3600 high capacity low latency 4 modules
[23:10:54] <A-KO> but no RGB
[23:10:55] <A-KO> lolol
[23:10:57] <Sousapro> I upgraded to Zen+ basically because I wanted the slightly better memory controller 
[23:11:24] <A-KO> corsair floods the market with vengeance pro modules (which is what I have)
[23:11:58] <signalblue> Sousapro: was it noticible?
[23:12:14] <Sousapro> A-KO: don't blame you man. I'm running Dominator Platinum RGB and those LEDs are gorgeous 
[23:12:40] <A-KO> Sousapro: I could go 1 for 1 Dominator Platinum in this build and it would actually work in 4 module mode. But at 3200 speeds. I forget if they were on the 3600 list or not.
[23:12:55] <A-KO> so yeah if I wanted to go 3200 ? It's on the HCL as fully validated for Dominator Plat
[23:13:19] <A-KO> I like the diffuser look on the Vengeance Pro a bit more
[23:13:31] <Sousapro> signalblue: yeah. I went from a below par memory controller to an above par memory controller for Zen+. Able to push my ram faster and tighter. Sold 1900x for $150 and bought 2950x for around $350. No regrets and double the cores
[23:13:38] <signalblue> oh wait
[23:13:52] <signalblue> they have 3866Mhz for the dom plat
[23:14:04] <Sousapro> Yeah it's their high end ram but it's expensive 
[23:14:09] <A-KO> Sousapro: I actually wanted Zen 3 for this board but at the time of building this I didn't want to wait. Really glad I didn't now.
[23:14:13] <signalblue> also... tighter?
[23:14:17] <signalblue> what does that mean?
[23:14:20] <Sousapro> signalblue: timings
[23:14:23] <signalblue> ah
[23:14:31] <Sousapro> So it waits less before doing more work
[23:14:49] <Sousapro> Timings can be a massive boost over clock speed if the system can handle it
[23:14:50] <A-KO> Sousapro: Only thing that's weird with my board, is the Vengeance is 16-20-20-38 ; but for some reason my tRC is 75. If I try to manually force 58, it aint happy
[23:15:08] <Sousapro> A-KO: have you used the ryzen dram calculator app? 
[23:15:11] <A-KO> nope
[23:15:18] <Sousapro> It might help you fine tune your timings
[23:15:52] <A-KO> oh, btw, Sousapro ; those temps I mentioned?
[23:15:57] <Sousapro> https://www.techpowerup.com/download/ryzen-dram-calculator/
[23:15:59] <A-KO> that's with the pump and fans (2x Noctuas) going full bore
[23:16:00] <A-KO> lol
[23:16:02] <A-KO> and it still can't keep up
[23:16:05] <A-KO> so that's why I want to replace it
[23:16:06] <Sousapro> ROFL
[23:16:15] <Sousapro> Yeah honestly I'm not surprised 
[23:16:19] <signalblue> 1usmus has an app for Ryzen CPU's as well
[23:16:21] <A-KO> it's a 240mm radiator
[23:16:24] <Sousapro> It's just not big enough 
[23:16:25] <signalblue> pretty interesting stuff
[23:16:30] <Sousapro> You need more surface area
[23:16:33] <A-KO> I can easily fit a 280 in here
[23:16:38] <A-KO> 360 might be stretching it due to my drives
[23:16:48] <signalblue> spinny bois?
[23:16:49] <signalblue> lol
[23:16:50] <A-KO> yeah
[23:16:56] <A-KO> I've got like 6 spinny bois in here
[23:16:58] <Sousapro> Custom look with 280 on top and another radiator on bottom or front would solve it
[23:17:10] <Sousapro> s/look/loop
[23:17:10] <layer8> Sousapro meant: "Custom loop with 280 on top and another radiator on bottom or front would solve it"
[23:17:12] <signalblue> 280 is enough... no?
