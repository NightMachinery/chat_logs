[22:49:09] <feep> yep
[22:49:11] <feep> segfaults immediately.
[22:49:20] <gwern> ie, you create a training dataset which is all of your finetuning text - dumped fanfiction datasets, novels, D&D stories, etc. you also include all of your ranked data: "[turn] COMPLETIONS:\n1. [the best-ranked]\n2. [the second-best ranked]\n3. [the third-best ranked]...". then, you do no RL training whatsoever, this is it. then you generate an outcome, infix 'COMPLETIONS:\n1.', and sample....
[22:49:21] * feep WAITS BEFORE TRYING AGAIN
[22:49:26] <niko> feep: you shouldn't try that on a channel with ozone
[22:49:26] <gwern> ...this is now simultaneously your finetuned fiction model, your ranker model, *and* your RL-ranked-finetuned model - it's just Decision Transformer, in other words
[22:49:43] <feep> niko: ah right, is there a bot test channel?
[22:49:59] <niko> ##yourtestchannel-feep ?
[22:50:05] <feep> I guess
[22:50:07] <nshepperd> just make a random channel with yourself
[22:50:13] <PapuaHardyNet> that sounds like a very tightly coupled set of features
[22:50:51] <gwern> this skips the need for *3* redundant models, it trains them jointly on all tasks simultaneously, it's very compute-efficient because you skip the absurd expense of doing all of the passes to compute the generator, double-ranker, and PPO, it's massively more stable because it;s just supervised learning...
[22:51:09] <gwern> I should needle schulman with this because it's such an improvement over regular preference-learning potentially
[22:51:20] <PapuaHardyNet> let me get this clear though: he is finetuning on a dataset that looks like "$PROMPT $CHOICE1 $CHOICE2 $CHOICE3" right?

[22:55:57] *** Joins: drethelin (drethelin@096-042-035-082.res.spectrum.com)
[22:56:12] <PapuaHardyNet> is the ranking based on quality of text generated? then that's a external factor we cannot model as part of the model
[22:56:17] <gwern> oh, it's quite explicit. you make sure you format it in ordinal order
[22:56:41] <gwern> you're not providing them in shuffled format. you want the best to always be prefixed with '1.' so you can decode starting with '1.' to get the best possible sample
[22:58:30] <PapuaHardyNet> also don't CYOAs have a specific / limited set of actions that a user chooses from? I assume that the format for the training text then is this "$PROMPT_USER $USER_CHOICE COMPLETIONS:\n1. $COMPLETION_1 [...]"
[22:58:48] <PapuaHardyNet> then I can understand how this would work
[22:58:52] <gwern> it doesn't matter where the actions come from
