[03:07:35] <listen_ers> i plug it in and forgot to have one
[03:08:02] <listen_ers> i eventest it i was like 5 mb in my driveway. it was a relief to find out it wasnt working yet
[03:08:34] <listen_ers> also that interface for the hap2 is the shit i really like it
[03:08:48] <listen_ers> even before i got it just convincing me to get one felt like a no brainer

[03:11:57] <listen_ers> esp since everything is manage electronically now so better safe than sorry
[03:16:56] <listen_ers> i couldve built maybe a 12tb nas and would have to buy a case to house six drives for around two fifty . same price as this network upgrade i did
[03:17:15] <listen_ers> still cheap af for both

[03:53:02] <listen_ers> well i never look at the specifics in my modem
[03:53:08] <ButterNoodle> I mean
[03:53:16] <ButterNoodle> ur paying for gig
[03:53:22] <ButterNoodle> and not gettin it?
[03:54:02] <listen_ers> yea that and no bandwidth cap
[03:54:19] <ButterNoodle> laptop direct and still no gig?
[03:54:31] <listen_ers> oh no i didnt test that exactly
[03:54:38] <listen_ers> its 8 channel modem tho
[03:54:38] <ButterNoodle> yea
[03:54:41] <listen_ers> i need to do that
[03:54:55] <listen_ers> we did buy that modem specifically too for the gig upgrade
[03:55:01] <ButterNoodle> mikrotik factory config?
[03:55:02] <listen_ers> so it could be capable
[03:55:23] <listen_ers> yea. im sure the mikrotic is alright im talking about the 8 channel motorola surfboard
[03:55:51] <ButterNoodle> yea that ac2 should be able to do gig unless u have a lot of fw rules
[03:55:53] <listen_ers> and i gotta wait for my PoE connectors cumming
[03:56:26] <listen_ers> so even at these hardware throttles i like we could have a network tank and switch gig plans on and off its all worth it
[03:56:46] <listen_ers> just took time to understand we could be getting better speeds
[03:57:00] <listen_ers> we actually upgrade the plan because of the cap tho
[03:57:10] <listen_ers> we were going over 1.2 terabytes or something
[03:57:33] <listen_ers> we havnt but nobody was accessing the xfinity accounts but ive begun that

[09:48:02] <listen_ers> manjaro is solid af i know a twitch streamer exclusively run manjaro and uses wine on 'em.
[09:48:34] <listen_ers> the wine is just the extra mile i say its mature but to stream on it too sounds like a headache
[09:48:42] <listen_ers> ig it works
[09:49:04] <listen_ers> besides i have only fun dip the linux landscape to let you know
[09:49:11] <listen_ers> tip of the iceberg so to speak
[09:51:06] <listen_ers> i dont really believe your experience i just knee jerk a response like its this to be believe actually i really know theres people that do it without a hitch i mean oob shit works codecs and shit is in the rearview like 2pac
[09:51:11] <listen_ers> raps
[09:51:43] <listen_ers> but i guess you have something going on. like your still at installation im serious
[09:52:36] <listen_ers> theres a learning curve but i hate to even mention it like i think im wrong about a learning curve windows does kick ass as a media center main..
[09:53:31] <listen_ers> you learn latex then you can be like this fucker trying to think im noob has no clue about LaTeX
[09:54:26] <listen_ers> i know a person at my LUG. this guy is doing mature retro emulators and talking specifics of LaTeX. its no joke
[09:56:45] <ButterNoodle> manjaro is linux for dummies
[09:56:52] <Cryowolf> bleh spilled energy drink all over my mousepad. Into the shower it went and now drying and I have to use a shitty backup :p
[09:57:10] <ButterNoodle> its a quick desktop

[09:57:25] <ButterNoodle> yea

[09:57:31] <MootPoot> maybe I wont break it
[09:57:32] <MootPoot> lol
[09:57:43] <ButterNoodle> its ez enough to install it wont matter
[09:57:43] <MootPoot> I validated popOS, tried again
[09:57:45] <MootPoot> no luck
[09:57:59] <MootPoot> would have done something else but I need that Nvidia gpu support
[09:58:08] <ButterNoodle> yea run windows

[10:00:26] <MootPoot> was planning to do that
[10:00:27] <ButterNoodle> or debian
[10:00:42] <MootPoot> but on atomic pi or a board Idgaf about 
[10:00:49] <MootPoot> not a system I actually use

[10:02:04] <MootPoot> to udb
[10:02:06] <MootPoot> usb
[10:02:25] <ButterNoodle> manjaro probably good.. its a quick desktop tbh
[10:03:01] <MootPoot> if it dosent work - back to win10 tbh 
[10:03:02] <ButterNoodle> I have manjaro running in a test vm.. runs nice
[10:03:05] <MootPoot> at least I know it'll work
[10:03:13] <ButterNoodle> tru

[10:10:30] <Cryowolf> I'm so not putting a memory foam mattress on the floor
[10:10:36] <MootPoot> why
[10:10:37] <Cryowolf> I need a good bed frame for it
[10:10:41] <MootPoot> y
[10:11:14] <listen_ers> the latest version will be probs most secure doesnt mean the best funtionality wise imho
[10:11:44] <listen_ers> you got hackers finding exploit its good
[10:11:54] <listen_ers> or the good hackers finding the exploits to fix
[10:11:54] <Cryowolf> cause I dont want to ruin it, nor do Iw ant to sleep on the floor. I want a proper installation with a rib bottom so I can get the most out of the mattress that I bought because it could support my back. Unfortunately with the ancient spring bottoms I use now it doesn't provide good support
[10:12:02] <Cryowolf> I want a propere bed
[10:12:05] <Cryowolf> proper*
[10:12:08] <listen_ers> look at the distro changelogs
[10:12:18] <MootPoot> why would you be ruining it by putting it on the floor?
[10:13:13] <Cryowolf> There's no real support for it, be gliding around and shit. Dust mites and other small things have easier access to it and can begin burrying into it and destroying it
[10:13:15] <listen_ers> springs are luxury you know
[10:13:29] <listen_ers> if you have enough padding anything solid suffices i know this
[10:13:41] <listen_ers> 4+ layers is good 3-4
[10:13:48] <Cryowolf> listen_ers, these are 20+ years old and no longer work properly. What I'm getting is a rib bottom on the frame
[10:14:01] <Cryowolf> the spring bottoms that is
[10:14:13] <Cryowolf> are too old to provide proper support with uneven spring support
[10:14:29] <listen_ers> uneven is an issue
[10:14:41] <Cryowolf> a bed frame + rib bottoms will suffice to create an even spread, a nice looking bed
[10:14:49] <MootPoot> ^
[10:14:54] <MootPoot> actual reason it seems like
[10:14:57] <MootPoot> nice looking bed
[10:14:57] <Cryowolf> and I get the support I need out of the bed (7+ comfort zones)
[10:15:07] <Cryowolf> back support etc
[10:15:24] <MootPoot> My memory foam mattress has been doing just dandy on the floor
[10:15:32] <Cryowolf> I also need it to support my body with all the crap I go through
[10:15:44] <Cryowolf> except on the floor makes it harder to get up in my condition
[10:18:46] <Cryowolf> https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/loenset-slatted-bed-base-s49481366/ these are what you put inside a bed frame

[10:21:33] <MootPoot> I'mma go read shit
[10:21:52] <Cryowolf> no I didnt, I said it was difficult to get off the floor
[10:22:20] <Cryowolf> if the mattress isn't on the floor. Problem solved
[10:22:28] <listen_ers> you can always create makeshift handles certain do help at any height
[10:22:40] <MootPoot> listen_ers: that's what a assist rail does
[10:22:51] <MootPoot> which is a cheaper option then an entire bed frame
[10:22:55] <listen_ers> true but stigma just diy
[10:23:33] <listen_ers> yes you cant always find large handles tho.... if only there were something convienient for it
[10:23:43] <Cryowolf> why go through all of that shit when I can get a bed frame instead?

[10:45:00] <Cryowolf> I could get one that doesn't have textile and padding and buy my own padding and textile. Thoughthat might be too expensive, I dunno...hmmm, depends what it costs

[11:18:28] <Cryowolf> https://www.ikea.com/se/sv/p/gladstad-klaedd-saengstomme-kabusa-ljusgra-80490453/ is the new one Im looking at

[11:18:54] <Bco1981> i don't have a bedframe, and don't plan to get one. just takes up more space.
[11:18:57] <Cryowolf> the old one is really ugly
[11:19:13] <Cryowolf> well I cant place mattress on the floor cause of my current injuries
[11:19:18] <Cryowolf> I cant stand up well
[11:19:23] <Cryowolf> and I dont want mattress on the floor
[11:19:35] <Cryowolf> having a bed frame to place it in would be so much better
[11:19:36] <Bco1981> my bed is a box mattres from jysk, with legs, that's it
[11:19:50] <Cryowolf> I see
[11:20:05] <Cryowolf> Mine is a foam mattress with cold foam and memory foam
[11:20:11] <Cryowolf> I cant put legs on it
[11:20:23] <Bco1981> yeah that is gonna need a frame for legs
[11:20:31] <Cryowolf> currently using resårbottnar but theyre 20+ years old and the springs are broken
[11:20:39] <Cryowolf> and I sleep unevenly
[11:20:47] <Cryowolf> so need something stable
[11:21:06] <Bco1981> ugh, that will hurt your back
[11:21:07] <Cryowolf> gladstad is the cheapest one with a sort of high gavel
[11:21:28] <Cryowolf> it includes rib botten, centersupport, the frame itself
[11:21:40] <Cryowolf> so I only need to put it together real quick and throw the mattress in
[11:21:41] <Cryowolf> and done
[11:22:53] <Cryowolf> its 2000 sek, chair is 2500 sek. My current budget is 23,000 but I might be able to up it to 24,000. Still puts me around 19-20k after. I need the rest for a tv and graphic card and potentially other stuiff like a washing machine
[11:23:19] <Cryowolf> https://www.ikea.com/se/sv/p/gruppspel-stol-foer-gaming-gunnared-svart-gra-10507584/ this is the one I'm looking at Bco1981

[11:24:16] <Cryowolf> there is a leather version but fuck that one
[11:24:27] <Cryowolf> the other one I looked at had a mesh back etc but this one has better ergonomic support
[11:24:35] <Cryowolf> and I like textile and padding
[11:25:16] <Cryowolf> the bedframe isnt the nicest looking, there's a nicer looking one for 100 euro more...but is it worth 100 euro for just that? imo no
[11:25:18] <Bco1981> but... what is the max load ?
[11:25:36] <Cryowolf> well every chair has about same

[11:26:21] <Cryowolf> https://www.ikea.com/se/sv/p/matchspel-stol-foer-gaming-bomstad-svart-80507608/ this is the other one I tried and it was ok

[11:27:08] <Cryowolf> which makes me sad
[11:27:36] <Cryowolf> why do they insist on pleather?
[11:27:50] <Bco1981> "for safety reasons, the castor locks automatically when not in use"... the wheels lock when you don't use it??? so you can't push it around.
[11:28:32] <Bco1981> castors*
[11:29:04] <Bco1981> have to attend a meeting, afk.
[11:32:36] <Cryowolf> not "lock" but there's some friction to stop it from rolling away if you stand up fast
[11:32:47] <Cryowolf> like its not gonna be pushed back through the room
[11:35:55] <Cryowolf> if I buy that bedframe + chair then a washing machine for 300 euro, I'm down to 1500 euro for graphic card and tv...hmmm, not gonna work. hmmm.....what do. Time to figure something out

[17:19:54] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: not the same thing as wild elephants albeit introduced to that area by humans
[17:20:09] <DunceCotus> SummerSkies: get one?
[17:20:16] <SummerSkies> dead
[17:20:35] <SummerSkies> and then use joe rogan's method to grill it
[17:21:10] <JesseDesu> i just stir fried some steak
[17:21:14] <JesseDesu> and eating it with rice
[17:21:18] <SummerSkies> nice
[17:21:20] <DunceCotus> why not just leave it to majestically skip through the forest underbrush
[17:21:31] <SummerSkies> DunceCotus: where did you get the steak you're eating from
[17:21:38] <DunceCotus> not from an elk
[17:21:43] <SummerSkies> DunceCotus: where
[17:21:51] <DunceCotus> see above
[17:22:00] <SummerSkies> you won't tell me how you got it will you?
[17:22:25] <SummerSkies> the meat industry is no good DunceCotus
[17:22:37] <SummerSkies> any action taken to avoid it is good
[17:22:55] <SummerSkies> hunting is my solution
[17:23:26] <DunceCotus> not everyone can hunt
[17:23:31] <SummerSkies> ya ain't gotta
[17:23:32] <JesseDesu> mike hunt
[17:23:44] <SummerSkies> but that's why i don't just leave it to majestically skip through the forest
[17:23:45] <DunceCotus> canhunt
[17:23:53] <SummerSkies> that's the big idea i was getting at
[17:24:00] * SummerSkies sits down and eats elk with DunceCotus
[17:24:09] <SummerSkies> we'll take ya huntin next year, you'll love it
[17:24:23] <DunceCotus> SummerSkies: why elk and not doe
[17:24:30] <SummerSkies> because joe rogan dude
[17:24:30] <amigojapan> Let's grow animals on steroids in the wild so we can hunt then :)
[17:24:42] <DunceCotus> a squid-eating doe in a polyethylene bag is fast n' bulbous, got me?
[17:24:48] <JesseDesu> what gun do you use
[17:24:59] <JesseDesu> can you use a 357 magnum with a scope
[17:25:12] <SummerSkies> DunceCotus: if I did end up getting that I wouldn't be mad at all
[17:25:20] <SummerSkies> but Elk 
[17:25:35] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: lets go on a real life journey to be a Pokemon Master
[17:25:58] <SummerSkies> JesseDesu: you can technically use any gun, but there's ideal ones
[17:26:05] <SummerSkies> in terms of legality my buddy knows more about that than I do 
[17:26:12] <SummerSkies> I just bought the gun he suggested I hunt with
[17:26:25] <JesseDesu> an AR-15?
[17:26:36] <DunceCotus> SummerSkies: Elk sounds like it would be a bit gamey
[17:26:52] <DunceCotus> maybe try tortoise

This kurisumasu keki is particularly special: studded with 223 diamonds with a combined weight of 170 carats. It took 6 months to design, a month to create, and was on offer for $1.72 millio

[18:57:54] <darkwitch> crunchy diamond flavor
[18:58:09] <amigojapan> darkwitch: Christmas cake is strawberry short cake
[18:58:30] <Bco1981> and had gone bad before anyone could eat it.
[18:58:44] <MootPoot> it seems like the secret to getting any crap the "most expensive" is to stick shiny garbage on it

[18:59:40] <darkwitch> they should be more creative
[18:59:54] <darkwitch> fill it with bitcoins or something
[19:00:06] <MootPoot> They should but it seems like these things are solely designed to get that record 
[19:00:19] <MootPoot> And be a tax write-off or money laundering source 
[19:03:08] <amigojapan> darkwitch: could you eat that cake?
[19:05:27] <darkwitch> amigojapan, my teeth would break. they are not harder than diamond
[19:05:51] <Bco1981> i'm getting a Diamond.
[19:06:04] <amigojapan> darkwitch: what a waste of cake :(
[19:06:22] <amigojapan> Bco1981: if that a GPU?
[19:06:36] <darkwitch> I think the idea is that you remove the diamonds before you eat the cake
[19:06:44] <Bco1981> amigojapan: yeah, Diamond Viper V330 PCI 4MB
[19:06:46] <MootPoot> get a gpu made out od 3090s
[19:07:05] <amigojapan> Ah ok darkwitch and Bco1981 
[19:09:08] <Bco1981> MootPoot: that package i thought was sent to the wrong person (me). that was the right package to me. but it was not my Diamond.
[19:09:37] <Bco1981> some ELSA ErazorIII AGP gpu
[19:09:50] <Bco1981> and one resistor was half torn off
[19:10:01] <MootPoot> Why are you getting one anyway?
[19:10:11] <Bco1981> rebuilding a childhood pc
[19:10:31] <Bco1981> and emulators is just not the same.
[19:10:35] <MootPoot> Cool
[19:11:20] <Bco1981> i am contemplating switching out the kids current pc's with dos pc's...
[19:11:30] <Bco1981> muhuahahahah
[19:11:35] <MootPoot> Lolololol
[19:13:22] <SummerSkies> DunceCotus said ive had enough of spirit science
[19:13:30] <SummerSkies> these fools are talking nonsense
[19:13:34] <darkwitch> the price of bourbon vanilla has dropped quite a bit. it was more expensive than silver for a while, now it's closer to half the price at 350 euros per kilo
[19:13:47] <amigojapan> Bco1981: you should give them c64s, more educational
[19:14:09] <Bco1981> amigojapan: that would be much easier to spot.
[19:14:21] <darkwitch> you could make a lot of christmas cake with that much vanilla
[19:15:41] <amigojapan> darkwitch: my mom used to have a littler bottle of vanilla extract
[19:16:39] <darkwitch> I may make some vanilla tincture too
[19:16:52] <darkwitch> not from a kilo of pods
[19:17:30] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I am watching this from the YouTuber you linked me https://youtu.be/dqWydv7hbpg
[19:17:31] <ImoutoBot> [title] A Witch Reacts║I Spent a Day with Satanists║ Non-Theistic Satanism - YouTube
[19:17:50] <DunceCotus> SummerSkies: they're too religious
[19:18:00] <DunceCotus> like hooray Jesus
[19:18:09] <DunceCotus> Jesus will return yada yada
[19:18:14] <DunceCotus> every Christmas same story
[19:18:23] <DunceCotus> or wasi t Esther
[19:18:27] <SummerSkies> i can certainly tell you that i do not want to join that conversation
[19:18:48] <DunceCotus> SummerSkies: hey we all have our kinks
[19:18:51] <darkwitch> it's not a bad idea to figure out what satanists are really like
[19:19:17] <SummerSkies> that is random to say, my friend
[19:19:22] <SummerSkies> in this context
[19:19:30] <DunceCotus> like New Age ideology is basically reactionary and conservative at core
[19:19:38] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I think there are many kinds of people who call themselves "Satanist"
[19:20:06] <darkwitch> compare with Statisticians
[19:20:19] <DunceCotus> Satanist can mean a lot of things
[19:20:24] <amigojapan> Lol
[19:20:27] <DunceCotus> for some people its an accessory
[19:20:38] <Smeef> Could be dyslexic supporters of Santa
[19:20:38] <DunceCotus> but it does serve as throughline for many of their activities
[19:21:11] <DunceCotus> right dyslexic supporters of Santa are an under-represented folk
[19:21:50] <DunceCotus> Santa and Satan and Saturn, and all the other Sailor Moons

[19:27:45] <Smeef> Technically Christians are Satanists because they believe that god exits
[19:28:04] <Sxem> theres a new sy fy channel movie out called letters to satan clause that i am not bothering to watch. it looks terrible
[19:28:06] <Smeef> Same way people used to believe Hades existed
[19:28:13] <MootPoot> Lol 
[19:28:19] <MootPoot> God exists
[19:28:19] <amigojapan> darkwitch: this witch is saying that they are atheists, but I think that is a modern version made by  Anton lavey
[19:28:22] <buZz> Smeef: fun nuance is that satanists dont even follow satan
[19:28:23] <MootPoot> Exits*
[19:28:48] <buZz> they follow themselves, not a diety or appeal to a higher power
[19:28:54] <MootPoot> God : *sees NFTs*. God: *Exits*
[19:29:17] <Smeef> *that* god, as in Satan being god-like, the same as many other mythological evil deities
[19:30:06] <amigojapan> buZz: that is the kind from Anton lavey
[19:30:12] <buZz> ja
[19:31:45] <darkwitch> they do have impressive mustaches

[21:02:29] <Smeef> I ordered a PC case on Amazon, and it never arrived and somehow a week later I can't find it anywhere to buy, I need help tracking down somewhere that has it for sale, it's a Thermaltake The Tower 100
[21:02:54] <Smeef> I ordered the parts specifically for this case, and now I can't frickin build it
[21:03:38] <Smeef> MSRP is supposed to be $109
[21:03:40] <MootPoot> what's so special about it
[21:03:49] <MootPoot> that you have parts that only work with this case
[21:04:29] <Smeef> It's got dust filters on every opening and it is half covered with glass panels that will show off the OLED panel on the AIO CPU cooler
[21:04:49] <MootPoot> hmm
[21:04:58] <MootPoot> I think there are a few fractals which can do the same

[21:05:19] <Smeef> I also need it to be super compact for a Mini-ITX
[21:05:23] <MootPoot> ah
