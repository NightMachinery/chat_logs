[03:38:57] <johnjaye> Zipheir: one other odd twist. apparently the plfa book *is* in the download as both tex and html
[03:39:06] <johnjaye> but if you try to browse the html version the relative links are all broken
[03:39:15] <johnjaye> so you can't go from one chapter to the next. -_-
[03:40:09] <Zipheir> Weird.
[03:40:35] <johnjaye> yes, very disppointing!
[03:44:03] <Zipheir> I still think it's awesome that Wadler took the time and effort to write an open-licensed textbook, bugs and all.
[03:44:57] <Zipheir> johnjaye: Complain on their issues tracker https://github.com/plfa/plfa.github.io/
[03:46:20] <johnjaye> ah yeah i forgot about that.
[03:46:57] <johnjaye> yes all my nitpicking is just my thoughts struggling to get it working. i think part of that is being gui-less and on freebsd simultaneously
[03:47:09] <johnjaye> but i did at least figure out how to use utf-8 in the terminal
[03:48:22] <johnjaye> by the way chicken is up to date. 5.3. but it calls it csi5 and csc5 for some reason
