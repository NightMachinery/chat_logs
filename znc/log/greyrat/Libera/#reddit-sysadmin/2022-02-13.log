[07:14:01] <Cl0udNinja> euphoricallysane, unfortunately thats not very feasible everywhere, digging underground is *super* expensive compared to just building support infra overhead. yes, it would be nice if everything was underground, but then you also run into the wild problems of places like newyork where anytime something has to be done, big chunks of street and dirt have to be moved, plus the added cost of protecting the underground items from the elements, 
[07:14:01] <Cl0udNinja> errosion, condensation, bugs, dirt, etc
[07:14:36] <Cl0udNinja> and then theres also places whose watertable is right below the city, so digging through that is a messy, long, and even more expensive process

[07:59:39] <monr0e> Cl0udNinja: We tend to absorb that sort of cost here in the UK, with the exception of neighbourhood runs which are sometimes on overhead lines (and that's usually only for telephony). Part of the requirement here is that we have so much in the way of buildings and topside infrastructre, it makes little sense to run OHC for everything. Instead, we usually build trunk lines that follow major thoroughfares, which means that remedial work is usually a 
[07:59:39] <monr0e> matter of a three-man crew lifting a few paving labs, and digging the three feet with a micro-backhoe. That's also an advantage to our infra - we don't tend to lay concrete, instead most of our roads are tarmac and our pavements are 20x20 slabs. 
[08:00:32] <monr0e> It does sometimes mean a hole in the street is there for a week whilst we wait on the right specialists, but usually it isn't much of an issue

[09:25:04] <Hunterkll> yes
[09:25:11] <Hunterkll> at a minimum, for similar reasons as windows
[09:25:13] <sd> 11<H​otmess> even with dynamic rnm?
[09:25:16] <sd> 11<H​otmess> *ram
[09:25:27] <Hunterkll> crash dump, kernel stores redundant copies of data structures, etc
[09:25:35] <Hunterkll> even if its just a 1GB swap or something dinky
[09:25:59] <Hunterkll> not for use as swap actual, you know, just for the other benefits and letting the memory manager have some room to optimize with 
[09:26:15] <sd> 11<H​otmess> dont get why elk reccomend you turn it off then

[09:27:33] <sd> 11<H​otmess> ah found a better option
[09:27:38] <Hunterkll> right, hence me saying even something dinky - their logic is sound on it, and just like with windows it's totally possible to run without 
[09:27:43] <Hunterkll> you just lose some shit 
[09:28:01] <Hunterkll> you're not gonna run into issues if you're at the bare minimum needed for the functions i said
[09:28:38] <Hunterkll> change your swapiness to better address elastic's situation
[09:28:55] <Hunterkll> and configure its memory limits 
[09:29:04] <Hunterkll> that little bit of swap also gives you some emergency wiggle room too

[10:42:24] <Hunterkll> you really, really do n't want to make that offer 
[10:42:33] <Hunterkll> unless you're buying all the cable management arms and a rack that has actual cabling space
[10:42:34] <Hunterkll> :D
[10:42:52] <PrincessZoey> sorry, this is a time for time trade.

[10:44:00] <PrincessZoey> it's not in 4k HDR so it's still blurry AF for me :P
[10:44:01] <Hunterkll> the 'cable channels' are designed for the era of 4U servers with 2 cables each max

[10:46:22] <Hunterkll> that's before i replaced the 2U abogve the disk shelf with an R730 
[10:46:35] <Hunterkll> PrincessZoey: yea but this one was an acceptable loss 
[10:46:36] <BWMerlin> Repeat after me, RAID is not a backup
[10:46:44] <Hunterkll> it was scoped out of backup policy because of cost and not need-to-have data
[10:46:53] <PrincessZoey> BUT BUT The first word is redundant! 
[10:47:07] <Hunterkll> you must RAID your 3com switches

[10:47:44] <PrincessZoey> it is THE case of that era 
[10:47:45] <Hunterkll> that's the houses's router 
[10:47:49] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:47:56] <Hunterkll> gotta love those 24 port 10mbit hubs at the bottom 
[10:47:57] <Hunterkll> LOL
[10:48:00] <Hunterkll> but yea
[10:48:14] <Hunterkll> that's from like 2002-2004 and was the router for the house, sharing a 56k dialup among 4 people
[10:48:37] <Hunterkll> hence the phone there, so i can check the modem/line if shits acting up
[10:48:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:49:00] <BWMerlin> Oh look at fancy pants over here with their 56k modem
[10:49:17] <Hunterkll> we upgraded to a verizon EVDO air card in a laptop running server 2003 at one point
[10:49:17] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:49:19] <BWMerlin> I had a 36.6k modem and that was the way we liked it
[10:49:27] <Hunterkll> up to 2mbit speeds
[10:49:28] <Hunterkll> was amazing
[10:49:31] <Hunterkll> it really sucked back then too
[10:49:37] <Hunterkll> because we had moved from a house that had cable @Home internet
[10:49:45] <Hunterkll> going cable -> dialup was lame 
[10:49:48] <Hunterkll> but not so bad back then i guess
[10:49:56] <BWMerlin> We did get 56k and then HFC (not actually sure what speed the HFC was at)

[10:54:56] <PrincessZoey> 11:59pm
[10:55:04] <PrincessZoey> each run through of that game unless you die takes 3-4 hours.
[10:55:29] <BWMerlin> Ahh, I see leaving it to the last minute
[10:55:49] <PrincessZoey> I had an english paper due + a reflection assignment on it I did yesterday lol
[10:55:52] <BWMerlin> Surly someone on twitch or youtube has played it and you can watch their videos at 4x speed
[10:56:40] <PrincessZoey> I read the deadline extension email wrong, I thought the game I finished last weekend was due this weekend instead (cuz ice storm and nobody had power for a few days) and this assignment got pushed back to the 23rd.. other way around

[13:29:03] <PrincessZoey> says the girl who uses a gui git manager (gitkraken)
[13:29:13] <Cl0udNinja> at least its git
[13:29:21] <PrincessZoey> exactly
[13:29:29] <PrincessZoey> it makes MRs way easier tbh
[13:29:37] <PrincessZoey> and that's 90% of what I do on git these days
[13:29:51] <Cl0udNinja> last place I worked decided they wanted to pay for and use PlasticSCM instead of git because 'it has gui is ez' that was total fucking trash
[13:30:18] <PrincessZoey> gitkraken is pretty good
[13:30:21] <PrincessZoey> worth paying for anyway
[13:30:28] <Cl0udNinja> speaking of MRs
[13:30:50] <Cl0udNinja> at work I'm known for doing a large number of merge requests all at once across many repos
[13:31:42] <Cl0udNinja> I wrote up a series of scripts that I just feed some info into and it will make branches, changes, commit and create MRs within seconds across any number of repos.. the readme says 'THIS IS LIKELY TO MAKE PEOPLE ANGRY'
[13:32:03] <Cl0udNinja> so far my record for a single pass has been 32 of our 200 repos
[13:32:07] <PrincessZoey> Damn
[13:32:15] <PrincessZoey> we need that at my now old job.
[13:32:19] <PrincessZoey> all MR stuff is done manually
[13:32:36] <PrincessZoey> hell even getting a necessary piece of information for every root task has to be manually run by an admin
[13:33:00] <Cl0udNinja> if its day to day stuff, I dont mind making an MR manually, but doing the exact same changes across many repos, I was just like 'fuck that work smarter not harder'
[13:33:42] <Cl0udNinja> MRs have to be approved, and every time I start a sentence with 'so I used my Mass MR scripts' I hear an audible groan across the entire engineering team
[13:34:02] <Cl0udNinja> I've now made the scripts available to others... 
[13:34:42] <PrincessZoey> I was in the middle of improving one of our validation scripts so you no longer had to manually add your folder to the python script to run it when I got fired lmao
[13:35:04] <Cl0udNinja> that just sounds like someone didnt want to lose their job that was useless so they held all the info and refused smart things like vault and automation
[13:35:26] <PrincessZoey> nnah, I got fired for upsetting a teamlead being too blunt in my feedback
[13:35:35] <Cl0udNinja> oh I was talking about the getting info bit
[13:35:39] <PrincessZoey> ah
[13:35:47] <Cl0udNinja> but yeah, I can see how that might get you fired :P
[13:36:33] <PrincessZoey> I didn't curse, I didn't attack anyone, I simply said their training methods are unfair and didn't sugar coat it
[13:36:41] <Cl0udNinja> I've only been fired once, every other job I've either quit normally, or walked in, raised hell, and quit on the spot
[13:38:09] <Cl0udNinja> I had a job where the CEO decided we should do something super dumb like restarting the DB servers every 5 minutes or something stupid of a similar idea. and I was WFH. I called him and my team and said 'do not touch anything, I'm on my way to the office'. I got there, and reamed the CEO in front of everyone, and quit on the spot
[13:38:28] *** Quits: stairmast0r (~stairmast@user/stairmast0r) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[13:38:39] <Cl0udNinja> he decided to do the thing I told him not to do, while I was in the car
[13:38:58] <monr0e> Man once I go live and start hiring, I want to hire people like you two
[13:39:29] <PrincessZoey> "Deleting the entire progress on a task and telling me to start over when I make a mistake does not serve as a useful lesson in learning our systems. The fact that I was specifically told I  couldn't ask the team lead on shift if what I was working on was correct did not serve your intended purpose of getting me to learn the processes. It showed
[13:39:29] <PrincessZoey> that I was on my own and am expected to be perfect by default which is not only unreasonable, but also completely unfair."
[13:39:30] <monr0e> A vote of confidence, if you will
[13:39:34] <Cl0udNinja> haha. sorry, already accounted for. I love the place I work, all the people there are awesome
[13:40:00] *** Joins: stairmast0r (~stairmast@user/stairmast0r)
[13:40:23] <monr0e> I still can't get over the fact that they just wiped all the work you did
[13:40:46] <Cl0udNinja> in fairness, I have had to teach some juniors about letting go of projects this way
[13:40:47] <monr0e> like, if that is their modus operandi, how the fuck do they turn a profiut
[13:41:23] *** Joins: mh3f (~mdhowle@cpe-98-25-217-234.sc.res.rr.com)
[13:41:30] <monr0e> oh shit apparently its sunday
[13:41:37] <PrincessZoey> it's so fucking stupid. Like name your training documents if you're going to be that fucking anal about notes. "TASK TRAINING 2.0.doc" should contain ALL the steps  necessary for the process. I shouldn't have to consult that AND the badly named "Authoritative story point guide.pdf" to know 
[13:41:40] <Cl0udNinja> I get them started on project that I know will be useless, but they will learn things along the way, and when they get almost complete, I tell them to nuke it and work on something else, or have them revamp it
[13:41:57] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[13:42:08] <Cl0udNinja> we call our training 'the firehose of knowledge'
[13:42:14] <PrincessZoey> The entire sequence is no joke about 75 steps.
[13:42:29] <PrincessZoey> everyone's going to fucking make mistakes when they're new. FUCK
[13:42:38] <Cl0udNinja> WHAT? IMPOSSIBLE
[13:42:43] <Cl0udNinja> BE PERFECT ALWAYS OR YOU FIRED
[13:42:53] <monr0e> Cl0udNinja: I don't particularly like that approach, if I'm honest. A project should ideally be seen either to fruition, or to a reasonable conclusion
[13:42:55] <PrincessZoey> God the money was nice but jesus christ they sucked
[13:43:26] <monr0e> Even if that conclusion is just testing it, saying "it works", and then filing it away
[13:44:07] <monr0e> PRincessZoey: That was pretty much my entire experience at the NHS
[13:44:38] <PrincessZoey> this was a project setup with agreement between my uni and fedex
[13:45:20] <Cl0udNinja> monr0e, yeah, its shitty, but some people dont deal with loss well, and getting juniors to understand that project loss can and will happen, is important. 
[13:45:34] <PrincessZoey> monr0e what are you setting up?
[13:46:03] <monr0e> Hm. Maybe. I suppose I just like the idea of going into a project with some degree of understanding abotu its direction.
[13:46:24] <Cl0udNinja> teach them not to be angry about project loss, things get better when you become a manager later and get told by higher ups you cant do a thing
[13:47:07] <monr0e> I'm building a SaaS HR offering that does thigns like accountancy, employee and asset management, project oversight, and a few other things. It's intended to be prety much workday, but on steroids and at the gym 24/7
[13:47:21] <PrincessZoey> so workday that doesn't suck?
[13:47:21] <Cl0udNinja> I dont usually have to go that far, most people I've worked with get that loss sucks and get over it
[13:47:38] <PrincessZoey> I'm of mind I get paid either way, and if the task sucks it's a win
[13:47:46] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[13:47:55] <PrincessZoey> #optimism
[13:48:13] <monr0e> Yep. Funny thing is, I'm pretty sure Workday uses some of the code I wrote as a pilot project when I worked at another major corp, which was never intended to see production. I can see some of what looks like my old design choices in it
[13:48:23] <Cl0udNinja> monr0e, the only thing I ask is that you find a good UX person :P
[13:48:27] <PrincessZoey> ^
[13:48:40] <PrincessZoey> I don't have a designer bone in my body. let me play with hardware plz
[13:48:44] <monr0e> It will go through a UX redesign. At the moment its literally just me
[13:48:47] <Cl0udNinja> I dont care if you got spaghetti code on the back, just please find a good ux person lol
[13:48:55] <PrincessZoey> ...why the fuck am I getting a CS degree again?
[13:48:59] <Cl0udNinja> haha
[13:49:02] <Cl0udNinja> because $$$
[13:49:14] <monr0e> Although I'm not one of those "simplify everything" types. 
[13:49:46] <PrincessZoey> there's a limit to the KISS principle 
[13:49:51] <monr0e> Oh absolutely
[13:49:59] <monr0e> kiss is balanced out by the seven P's
[13:50:10] <PrincessZoey> also why the hell are y 'all are you up at 4am?
[13:50:17] <monr0e> It is 10:20am
[13:50:19] <Cl0udNinja> its only 0220 here
[13:50:21] <PrincessZoey> ah
[13:50:28] <monr0e> there is no EST. There is only GMT
[13:50:33] <PrincessZoey> (I'm up cuz I have hw due today lmao)
[13:50:43] <monr0e> You have homework due on a sunday?
[13:50:46] <PrincessZoey> and apparently it wasn't getting done when any of my friends were awake
[13:50:48] <PrincessZoey> Yep, two papers
[13:51:04] <Cl0udNinja> my sleep schedules out of whack, has been for months..
[13:51:06] <monr0e> ... why on earth on a sunday
[13:51:19] <Cl0udNinja> so the prof can grade them on the shitter before class monday
[13:51:26] <monr0e> Cl0udNinja: That's why I hate wfh. My sleeping pattern is absolutely fucked
[13:51:39] <PrincessZoey> lmao, that's probably true of my english professor, my gaming and history one won't get these graded for a month probably
[13:51:48] <Cl0udNinja> even when I was in the office I've had similar issues
[13:51:55] <monr0e> Man I wish we had gaming assignments when I was in college
[13:51:58] <monr0e> althoguh I dropped out so
[13:52:03] <Cl0udNinja> I've even cut all the way back to only 1 monster a day, 1 soda max, and water otherwise
[13:52:10] <PrincessZoey> It's new this semester but it's pretty cool.
[13:52:30] <PrincessZoey> I usually don't drink caffeine but I just got over being sick and I cannot focus on this fucking paper
[13:52:30] <monr0e> Drink tea. I started drinking fruit teas instead of smoking and I haven't had a cigarette since the solstice
[13:52:48] <PrincessZoey> I wrote my 6 page english paper in two hours with ease, this is worse than pulling teeth cuz it's on religion
[13:52:55] <monr0e> Still have the 'lectric pipe, but /shrug
[13:53:09] <PrincessZoey> I have my vape in my hand as I type lmao
[13:53:24] <Cl0udNinja> I dropped out of HS and got my GED, went to college for a semester at 16. was tryin to do game design. some college bullshit happened, ended up not going back. went to a shitty college a few years later, got my associates in CS
[13:53:39] <monr0e> Heh, I have nothing but GCSE's
[13:53:45] <monr0e> everything I do is self-taught
[13:53:46] <PrincessZoey> I got expelled for hacking and got my GED
[13:53:53] <monr0e> lmao thats wicked
[13:53:55] <PrincessZoey> thank you hak.5, not
[13:54:02] <Cl0udNinja> monr0e, yeah same, the college shit didnt teach me anything. I was there for the paper
[13:54:04] <monr0e> I still watch that channel
[13:54:13] <PrincessZoey> it still exists? I got expelled in 07 lol
[13:54:27] <monr0e> lmao ye, it doesn't get a while lot of traffic, but its still up
[13:54:38] <PrincessZoey> I was writing a modification for the switchblade iirc.
[13:54:49] <PrincessZoey> and accidentally ran it on my schools network... whoops
[13:55:12] <PrincessZoey> too little variety in flash drives back then. 
[13:55:34] <Cl0udNinja> I did similar with Cain and Abel, the schools IT guy burst in the room like he was gonna murder someone
[13:55:54] <monr0e> heh, I got suspended once for gaining administrator privileges and pushing Monster Truck Madness and Counter Strike to every machine
[13:56:15] <Cl0udNinja> psh, they stupidly gave us removable harddrives, that we could take home
[13:56:17] <monr0e> It was there for months too
[13:56:20] <Cl0udNinja> we just put portable games on that shit
[13:56:37] <PrincessZoey> we did that with zipdisks. fuck I'm old lol
[13:56:45] <Cl0udNinja> oh zipdisk
[13:57:01] <Cl0udNinja> that was around when I was into game modding for Total Annihilation and Half-Life 1
[13:57:02] <monr0e> I just played around tbh. I got caught because I was playing with the remote monitoring suite, and an admin caught me using the same suite
[13:57:09] <PrincessZoey> I'm pretty sure my first job still rely on it as part of their 1-2-3 backup solution
[13:57:13] <monr0e> I miss zip drives
[13:57:50] <Cl0udNinja> wouldnt you need like a ton of zipdisks for that?
[13:57:52] <monr0e> I still have my old XP machine that has a zip reader in it
[13:57:57] <Cl0udNinja> or do they make larger capacity ones now?
[13:58:04] <PrincessZoey> nnah, they back up like 5 things on them specifically
[13:58:11] <PrincessZoey> quickbooks company file, important docs
[13:58:35] <PrincessZoey> basically only the "the company goes out of business if this disappears" stuff
[13:58:42] <monr0e> Weren't they like, up to 700mb?
[13:58:46] <PrincessZoey> 750
[13:58:50] <monr0e> yeah that
[13:59:14] <monr0e> Oh yeah firewire drives. Fuck I miss firewire
[13:59:17] *** Quits: fcinq (~irc@46.105.34.51) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[13:59:20] <Cl0udNinja> gross
[13:59:35] <PrincessZoey> they were complaining how fast their computers were, wouldn't make the zipdisks read and write faster too? "No, you're using a zipdrive that you got when I was in middle school, it's gunna be a turd"
[13:59:36] <Cl0udNinja> firewire was turrible
[13:59:46] <Cl0udNinja> lo.l
[13:59:46] <monr0e> I just liked the design, you could never be confused as to whether or not it was going in the right way
[14:00:12] <PrincessZoey> thank god it wasn't one of the parallel port drives
[14:00:20] <monr0e> o lort
[14:00:33] <PrincessZoey> usb2.0 though. and the original one was ATA
[14:00:42] <Cl0udNinja> I think I have an 8GB SCSI somewhere stil
[14:01:09] *** Azem is now known as Emet-Selch
[14:01:13] <monr0e> I found an old hard drive the other day that was 16gb
[14:01:22] <monr0e> I still have no idea what it came from
[14:01:23] <Cl0udNinja> PHEW 16 WHOLE GB!?
[14:01:30] <monr0e> ikr
[14:01:43] <Cl0udNinja> bah I know what Im doin tomorrow :(
[14:01:51] <Cl0udNinja> I'm gonna finally purge my bins
[14:02:29] <PrincessZoey> I don't have any techy stuff anymore.
[14:02:30] <Cl0udNinja> I've not touched anything in those bins in years.. many years.. its like an archelogy dig
[14:02:33] <PrincessZoey> just my macbook and old laptop
[14:02:48] <monr0e> I still use a lot of that old hardware today tbh
[14:02:52] <Cl0udNinja> pretty sure the 'newest' stuff thats in there is IDE
[14:03:04] <Cl0udNinja> theres likely an old amd athlon too
[14:03:05] <monr0e> My right hand monitor is an ooold 4:3 tft panel
[14:03:24] <Cl0udNinja> oh I have one of those but I dread getting it out because its got a short somewhere inside and loves to fucking zap me
[14:03:28] <monr0e> I think I've mentioned before that my email server runs on an elderly 2001 ell inspiron
[14:04:08] <Cl0udNinja> I moved mine to linode years ago. no hardware in my house except my desktop and work laptop
[14:04:12] <Cl0udNinja> and the 1950 thats collecting dust
[14:05:08] <monr0e> I can't afford to maintain a cloud server rn tbh. I'm putting everything I can back to give me a sluch fund when I start up
[14:05:31] <Cl0udNinja> eh, a linode is like $5-10 
[14:05:36] <CptLuxx> buyvm
[14:05:38] <CptLuxx> 14$ a year
[14:05:38] <CptLuxx> lol
[14:05:41] <monr0e> what
[14:05:48] <Cl0udNinja> are they decent though?
[14:05:52] <PrincessZoey> yeah I pay $12 for DO but I only use it for thelounge and a bridge between discord and groupme for my gaming class
[14:05:53] <CptLuxx> they are cheap
[14:06:14] <Hunterkll> yea linode is the tits 
[14:06:24] <Hunterkll> DO is ... special
[14:06:48] <Cl0udNinja> Hunterkll, I was asking about buyvm :P
[14:06:50] <PrincessZoey> I had a kimsufi dedi but they decided getting portscanned warranted a nuke of my server and reinstall.
[14:06:51] <Cl0udNinja> I know linode is good lol
[14:07:11] <Cl0udNinja> I've got... 2 mail servers, a webserver, my media box, bnc, a box for runnin esp32-qemu that I've not been using lately..
[14:07:26] <Cl0udNinja> I think theres something else I'm missing, but thats the majority
[14:07:34] <Hunterkll> buyvm is...
[14:07:37] <Hunterkll> you get what you pay for
[14:07:39] <CptLuxx> cheap
[14:07:39] <Hunterkll> basically
[14:07:39] <CptLuxx> :D
[14:07:42] <PrincessZoey> I just wanted a bouncer for IRC that wasn't irccloud 
[14:07:47] <PrincessZoey> and I was already paying for my vps
[14:07:50] <Hunterkll> $5/mo linode 
[14:07:53] <Hunterkll> or
[14:07:56] <Hunterkll> PrincessZoey: Oracle cloud 
[14:08:04] <Cl0udNinja> oh fuck.. I forgot to shutdown my old web server
[14:08:06] <Hunterkll> 2 1GB ram VMs free for life 
[14:08:10] <PrincessZoey> .... 
[14:08:19] <CptLuxx> free for life
[14:08:19] <monr0e> Eeehh, I'm not too fussed about the mailserver. It does need updating to 20.04, but it's rock solid even after 20 years
[14:08:21] <PrincessZoey> welp, I know what I'm doing after this paper
[14:08:22] <CptLuxx> till they decided else
[14:08:22] <CptLuxx> :D
[14:08:41] <Hunterkll> well
[14:08:46] <Hunterkll> when they change, you move elsewhere
[14:09:09] <PrincessZoey> I wish I could clone my DO vps to them, so I don't need to setup all my reverse proxies again
[14:09:12] <Hunterkll> it's 1/8 OCPU (Oracle CPU provision) and 1GB ram, with 100GB free storage for the account (so, 50/50 or however you want to set it up)
[14:09:29] <Hunterkll> PrincessZoey: you could just restore a tgz of the root fs on the same distro
[14:09:44] <Cl0udNinja> 2 of my boxes are on speedykvm, they've been pretty good. prices comparable to linode, but I got a great deal on like 1TB of storage
[14:10:50] <Hunterkll> PrincessZoey: assuming that both are just regular boot of grub and you properly re-run grub configs / store kernel before rebooting anyway
[14:10:52] <Cl0udNinja> theres also the free tier aws instances
[14:11:01] <Hunterkll> Cl0udNinja: only free for a year, just like azure
[14:11:10] <Hunterkll> then again, if you run your own mail server
[14:11:10] <Cl0udNinja> soooooo make new accounts? :D
[14:11:11] <Hunterkll> ;)
[14:11:11] <PrincessZoey> I'm uh... not welcome on AWS 
[14:11:24] <Cl0udNinja> Hunterkll, my thoughts exactly lol
[14:11:30] <monr0e> AWS free tier is honestly not that great
[14:11:31] <Hunterkll> PrincessZoey: OCI needs a CC to validate account FYI 
[14:11:32] <PrincessZoey> something something bitcoin mining farm I never paid for
[14:11:41] <Cl0udNinja> thats why I have `fuck-you_<company>_accountcreation@domain` aliases everywhere :D
[14:11:43] <PrincessZoey> easy lol
[14:11:44] <Hunterkll>  but you don't pay anything
[14:11:49] <Hunterkll> so just a heads up 
[14:13:00] <PrincessZoey> that's fine
[14:13:04] <PrincessZoey> thanks Hunterkll
[14:13:15] <Hunterkll> yea i run a few irc bots n stuff on OCI lol
[14:13:18] <monr0e> I'm gonna check out that oracle free tier though
[14:13:29] <Hunterkll> i also have converted mine to a paid account, but the always free stuff still is free on paid account
[14:13:33] <Hunterkll> i have some solaris stuff up there lol
[14:13:51] <Emet-Selch> how much do they charge for Solaris instances ?
[14:13:59] <estranger> lol I've never seen anyone willingly use Oracle cloud 
[14:14:30] <Cl0udNinja> Hunterkll just likes the way that Oracle dick tastes
[14:14:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[14:14:36] <Hunterkll> i pay for java too
[14:14:43] <Hunterkll> Emet-Selch: no more than other VMs, but you get patches 
[14:14:50] <Emet-Selch> gotcha
[14:14:51] <PrincessZoey> Emet-Selch great name
[14:14:56] <Emet-Selch> ;)
[14:15:04] <Hunterkll> PrincessZoey: i got him hooked hahah
[14:15:10] <PrincessZoey> best villian in ffxiv
[14:15:26] <PrincessZoey> the ffxiv on mac group I'm a contributor for named their user for wine emet-selch
[14:15:43] <Emet-Selch> lol
[14:16:13] <Hunterkll> PrincessZoey: i dunno, i see a group running around called spank laha 
[14:16:16] <Hunterkll> lol!
[14:16:37] <PrincessZoey> pretty fuckin amazing that an M1 Pro can run at 3440x1440p on high at 50-60fps and default screen res at 90+ on maximum
[14:16:48] <PrincessZoey> not bad for having to go through wine and rosetta2
[14:17:09] <Emet-Selch> o.O wow
[14:17:34] <PrincessZoey> the stock launcher barely managed 30 on standard
[14:17:44] <PrincessZoey> but that's what happens when you use a crossover build from 2019
[14:20:37] <Hunterkll> Aishou Sk: The Casino is currently OPEN!  Blowj----Blackjack - Come see Aishou the gambling cat to inquire!
[14:20:41] <Hunterkll> *laughs*

[14:21:35] <Hunterkll> Primal/Famfrit main
[14:22:24] <PrincessZoey> I f inally got my DoL jobs  to 90. that was a slog, working on DoH now.
[14:22:26] <BWMerlin> Finished the assignment yet?
[14:22:38] <Emet-Selch> DoL was easiest for me, except fisher
[14:22:39] <PrincessZoey> 3/4 of a page to go :D
[14:22:49] <PrincessZoey> yeah fisher is sitting at 76 cuz i'm sick of looking at it lol.
[14:23:00] <PrincessZoey> btn/miner are 90 though
[14:23:18] *** Quits: SlaveGeek334269 (~root@li2114-242.members.linode.com) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[14:23:22] <Emet-Selch> I had enough leves to get it to level 90 without going to ocean fishing 
[14:23:47] <PrincessZoey> I did 63 to finish btn/min so I'm waiting to get them back up
[14:23:59] <PrincessZoey> that was a terrible night, ngl
[14:24:12] <Emet-Selch> oooof
[14:24:31] <Emet-Selch> just get drunk like I did and don't know what the fuck you are doing
[14:24:38] <PrincessZoey> I don't drink lol
[14:24:51] <Emet-Selch> that is also how I finished Endwalker on New Years lol
[14:24:57] <Emet-Selch> oh well
[14:25:01] <PrincessZoey> oof
[14:25:10] <PrincessZoey> EW was good but I enjoyed shadowbringers more
[14:25:23] <PrincessZoey> that last quest though. I was in voice chat with some friends freaking out
[14:25:34] <Emet-Selch> ShB was much better imo
[14:25:44] <Emet-Selch> though lvl 85-87 quests were top notch
[14:25:47] <PrincessZoey> I can tell because of your name xD

[14:29:55] <BWMerlin> We were about 90% Mac and are moving to Windows so I am one of the few people who genuinely need a Mac for work as there really is somethings you cannot do on a Windows PC that you need a Mac for
[14:29:55] <PrincessZoey> then that fucker is dead in two hours flat

[14:31:10] <PrincessZoey> I am a little worried though, I've had this since October and it only has 39 cycles but is at 94% health
[14:31:25] <PrincessZoey> and my settings to not keep it charged to 100% isn't being respected (assume MacOS beta bug)
[14:31:54] <monr0e> if you charge it up fully and completely discharge it, it won't last as long as it would if you were to take it up to, say 70% and discharge it to 20%
[14:32:25] <PrincessZoey> oh, that's why. It got turned off by one of my apps
[14:32:31] <BWMerlin> Batteries should go onto bypass at 100%

[22:09:06] <sideup66> I'm a little off today. 6 am night with a nightmare team at work. Was a good time
[22:09:34] <Cl0udNinja> lol
[22:09:55] <Cl0udNinja> I do not miss that kind of shit at all
[22:11:22] <sideup66> Basically we have a cross border system that does stuff, between two countries (I'm redacting as I'd like to stay employed)....but basically they turned off one system that shouldn't have affected us
[22:11:31] *** Joins: euphoricallysane (~quatro@user/euphoricallysane)
[22:11:44] <Cl0udNinja> you forgot to put 'should' in quotes, theres your problem
[22:12:01] <sideup66> But didn't account for a cross dependancy that existed if both sides were off and our side was started. They would have to have the other up
[22:12:27] <Cl0udNinja> soooo splitbrain hell?
[22:12:42] <Cl0udNinja> or were the systems nukin each other tryin to take ownership of the area?
[22:13:12] <sideup66> ADHD it took them all night and a dev team to figure out a db update to separate them and allow our side to start. The change shouldn't have touched us but for whatever reason and incompetence, they didn't realize their own app had cross dependancy
[22:13:29] <sideup66> Was an app, not network....though we did have a split brain too in the same night (separate ticket)
[22:13:38] <sideup66> Then one of my app servers died for no reason
[22:13:54] <Cl0udNinja> have you tried just setting the whole DC on fire and starting over?
[22:14:03] <onicrom> haha
[22:14:06] <estranger> sounds a CP vs AP problem
[22:14:43] <estranger> but I dunno the specifics here, just a gander
[22:15:36] <estranger> now if you uses Kafka to handle the db replica between borders...... 👹
[22:16:03] <sideup66> Oracle stuffs, like I said I'm just redacting stuff that can identify
[22:16:24] <sideup66> Well the app issue was 100% unrelated
[22:16:28] <sideup66> Different system
[22:16:43] <sideup66> The app is a crappy app running on server 2012 r2 that leaks memory like a sieve
[22:16:49] <Cl0udNinja> estranger, https://www.cc.com/video/9r4tti/key-peele-getaway-driver outside: you tryin to start your system, inside: the devs starting theres
[22:16:58] <Cl0udNinja> theirs*
[22:16:59] <estranger> ahh Oracle... got GG in the middle?
[22:17:07] <sideup66> If the servers on more than a month the whole memory setup gets sketchy. this thing has 80 days.
[22:17:12] <Cl0udNinja> er sorry, I mean sideup66 
[22:17:26] <lemming> gotta love it when something just randomly starts working.... and you've not changed a damn thing so have no idea why
[22:17:43] <estranger> lemming solar flares is my go-to in situations like this
[22:17:51] <Cl0udNinja> lemming, something else is about to break majorly and its now shrodingers quantum system until it makes itself known
[22:17:53] <sideup66> I'm supposed to have a night crew on OnCall weeks
[22:18:06] <lemming> I spent a few hours last month trying to get email alerts going from my UPS... to no avail...
[22:18:09] <sideup66> They cover hands on keyboard crap like the app server and escalate if it's ugly
[22:18:16] <lemming> I just got the monthly report email from it.
[22:18:18] <sideup66> But entire team is noobs right now
[22:18:30] <sideup66> And I have to babysit per the manglement
[22:18:59] <lemming> sideup66, if you want noobs... our CSOC raised a high priority incident... over something that group policy did....
[22:19:01] <estranger> oof
[22:19:22] <sideup66> Oh lawdy
[22:19:40] <estranger> so glad I'm a vendor hehe
[22:19:45] <sideup66> Mine right now need to stop blaming everything on changes, I explained this to them politely
[22:20:00] <estranger> don't deal with that crap... I just deal with shotty updates to our crap lol
[22:20:02] <sideup66> I told them, learn to make those calls later when you just fucking know
[22:20:24] <lemming> sideup66 at the company I work for, CSOC raised a change... at 2pm on the 24th of december...
[22:20:26] <estranger> fix it fix it fix it, then RCA it
[22:20:27] <sideup66> A g I l e
[22:20:55] <sideup66> Yeah I hit that team over the head with the one app issue
[22:20:58] <sideup66> Rca tickets
[22:20:59] <lemming> approved it themselves, implemented it, broke things, and then managed to lock nearly everyone out of the system when trying to back it out
[22:21:11] <sideup66> They blame a defect...but ffs your change had NOBODY to approve
[22:21:19] <sideup66> Idk how it made it through
[22:21:23] <lemming> yeah
[22:21:42] <sideup66> Which fine, defect but I'm putting problem management on your butt
[22:21:50] <sideup66> Account for this crap and know what your turning odf
[22:21:52] <sideup66> Off
[22:22:04] <Cl0udNinja> estranger, same, glad I'm at a vendor company, we build the app. I get to play around in the background and make my team angry by doing things like mass merge requests across 30 repos
[22:22:17] <lemming> we had another good one like that not long ago, team raised a change, approved it themselves, it failed, they backed it out... they raised the same change again, approved it themselves and said it was "low risk"... even though it had failed the first time and caused half a dozen HPI's
[22:23:30] <sideup66> Lmao
[22:23:35] <sideup66> Our network issue was fun
[22:23:54] <sideup66> They were updating line cards and caused a split brain at the load balancer by knocking the HA out
[22:24:01] <sideup66> Which would have just failed over
[22:24:09] <lemming> our head of change management... had a little bit of a conniption over that one
[22:24:13] <sideup66> Then they wanted to proceed after taking out a datacenter
[22:24:19] <lemming> as did our major incident co-ordinator
[22:24:34] <sideup66> And we're fighting with incident management after knocking out a datacenter and breaking major apps in the other country
[22:24:38] <lemming> lol
[22:25:02] <sd> 11<H​otmess> lol
[22:25:09] <sideup66> And everyone's telling them you need to back up. Find out why the hell this happened and then proceed

[22:27:55] <sd> 11<H​otmess> one of the many reasons i hate agile tbh
[22:28:09] <estranger> we had a cool one recently... we have a k8s cluster just to manage our SaaS offering..... and somehow customer clusters got scheduled on it :D

[22:28:38] <sideup66> The concept is fine
[22:28:55] <sideup66> It's mba types sadly who don't understand....funny enough the show silicon valley highlights this
[22:29:00] <Kiernian> agile is a pox on all modern software and leads to creep, bloat, debt, and all sorts of other horrible things. The fact that you CAN fix it fast should not be used to excuse shitty practices.
[22:29:13] <sideup66> How management completely misses the point from the engineer and turns it into something else
[22:29:53] <sideup66> Kiernian: it's not about that. Honestly I think that is mba types not understanding it and turning it into something it's not
[22:30:00] <Kiernian> yes. Agreed.
[22:30:03] <sideup66> Originally the concept itself is ok
[22:30:11] <estranger> our product managers are all super technical
[22:30:14] <Kiernian> sadly, it is no longer that.
[22:30:33] <Kiernian> someone should take what it should have been, rename it something else, and re-implement it.
[22:31:55] <estranger> a few are ex Google, PMing waaay bigger projects
[22:33:13] <sideup66> Either way

[23:23:31] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> quick question
[23:23:54] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> when a DNS server is both authoratitive and recursive, is that conditional forwarding?
[23:25:15] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> for example, if it is authoritative for corp.com but not authoritative for google.com, and instead asks a recursive resolver for that, would that be conditional forwarding?
[23:25:40] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> if corp.com then $IP, if google.com then ask recursive-resolver.
[23:28:54] <sd> 11<H​otmess> errrr
[23:29:17] <sd> 11<H​otmess> that would be a situation where you have a problem imo. or your using a glue record
[23:29:56] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> but there's no reason to mention glue records here
[23:30:16] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> you know? a glue record is for things like ns1.$domain and what not
[23:30:50] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> just trying to get a better picture on what conditional forwarding is
[23:31:23] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> `Conditional forwarders are DNS servers that only forward queries for specific domain names. Instead of forwarding all queries it cannot resolve locally to a forwarder, a conditional forwarder is configured to forward name queries to specific forwarders based on the domain name contained in the query.`... does this apply to my example is basically what i'm asking here lol
[23:32:21] <sd> 11<H​otmess> a glue record is what you use to get out of the situation where the server is both authortative and recervice though...
[23:32:41] <sd> 11<H​otmess> which is why i am not sure why a server would both be authorative and recerseive
[23:33:29] <sd> 11<H​otmess> normaly you have either never both
[23:33:45] <DrZak> glue>
[23:34:02] <sd> 11<H​otmess> your recersive dns servers get you the answer from an authoritive server
[23:34:06] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> here
[23:34:07] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> Glue records are DNS records created at the domain's registrar. The record provides a complete answer when the TLD nameserver returns a reference for an authoritative nameserver for a domain. For example, the domain name “example.net” has nameservers “ns1.example.net” “ns2.example.net”.
[23:34:28] <sd> 11<H​otmess> yeah thats a glue record
[23:34:39] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> yeah but that's not what i'm asking here
[23:34:49] <CptLuxx> horse glue
[23:34:51] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> conditional forwarders is what i'm asking
[23:34:54] <koollman> why do you ask yourself that question ? 
[23:36:07] <sd> 11<H​otmess> "when a DNS server is both authoratitive and recursive, is that conditional forwarding?"
[23:36:27] <sd> 11<H​otmess> no conditial forwarding is recersive forwarding for specific conditions. like a specific domain
[23:36:54] <sd> 11<H​otmess> the only diffrence between condital forwarding and recersive lookup is that its triggered by a programed condition

[23:38:58] <sd> 11<H​otmess> but thats where you get into loops again :sigh
[23:38:58] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> so if you ask who is authoritative for google.com, it's nsX.google.com
[23:39:05] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> which you escape with glue
[23:39:06] <sd> 11<H​otmess> lets check
[23:40:41] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> so if your config says `zone "newdomain.com" {
[23:40:41] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin>     type forward;

[23:40:42] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> };` then when you query that server for newdomain.com then that request will be sent over to 22.22.22.22 as opposed to that server itself doing a forward lookup... right?
[23:41:08] <sd> 02<s​ysadmin> this is bind which is arguably the better (more extensible/flexible) DNS server
