[01:31:41] <therewasatime> thanks, yeah, it's relatively simple, but trying to figure out the most idiomatic approach
[01:31:56] <PaulWay[w]> Serializer, user-based ModelViewSet, update method, some field to list the permissions.

[01:38:51] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.  That.  Perfect.
[01:38:52] <b-rex> in that method, you'd likely have a check to see if the request.user is allowed to set the permission of a particular user on that object

[01:52:02] <Steve-Dusty> should i use CBVs with DRF
[01:53:35] <b-rex> CBVs are more flexible in the sense that it's probably a lot easier to switch between different subclasses of viewset?
[01:53:48] <b-rex> whereas a function based view is just a function based vie

[02:03:14] <CodenameTim> I think it comes down to personal preference. I really enjoy the opinions that DRF makes for viewsets so I end up using classes that inherit from those classes and mixins a lot. I end up having to revert to the documentation when I try to use an API view for specific method or if I were trying to use a FBV with DRF.

[03:49:00] <Steve-Dusty> FunkyBob
[03:49:12] <Steve-Dusty> can you explain how you put multiple sites on one droplet?
[03:49:17] <Steve-Dusty> each droplet = 1 IP
[03:49:27] <Steve-Dusty> when you go to 1 IP you see 5 different sites together?
[04:01:25] <PaulWay[w]> Different DNS names = different host handling on the one server.
[04:01:50] <Steve-Dusty> wut
[04:01:56] <Steve-Dusty> what if you just go to 1 IP directly
[04:02:10] <Steve-Dusty> ok, say you host them all
[04:02:18] <Steve-Dusty> but u havent configured domains yet
[04:02:30] <Steve-Dusty> what happens when you go to 1 IP directly
[04:02:46] <PaulWay[w]> Do you type in Google's IP address, or 'google.com'?
[04:03:03] <PaulWay[w]> Don't equate 'IP address' to 'web site'.
[04:03:25] <PaulWay[w]> Do you think Google has 'google.com' served by one IP address?
[04:05:15] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: that depends on how you configure your web server
[04:05:22] <FunkyBob> the formal term is "name based virtual hosting"
[04:05:47] <FunkyBob> your browser sends a Host: header in the request to say which host it things it's connecting to
[04:05:55] <Steve-Dusty> i just put the IP into my domain configuration..
[04:06:09] <FunkyBob> the web server can be configured to route that accordingly... and have a default fallback for unmatched

[04:08:20] <PaulWay[w]> That's not an IP address btw.

[04:10:27] <PaulWay[w]> *shrugs*  Dunno.
[04:10:35] <PaulWay[w]> It's certainly easy to do with Apache.
[04:11:05] <Steve-Dusty> what about nginx
[04:11:13] <PaulWay[w]> https://lmgtfy.app/?q=name+based+virtual+host+nginx
[04:11:20] <FunkyBob> because apache created the term
[04:11:34] <Steve-Dusty> PaulWay[w] :rage:
[04:11:51] <PaulWay[w]> You asked a question that you should have googled - that's on you :-)
[04:12:00] <Steve-Dusty> `https://lmgtfy.app` is a browser?
[04:12:20] <FunkyBob> Let Me Google That For You... lmgtfy
[04:12:44] <Steve-Dusty> https://imgur.com/a/iA1y2To jokes on you it doesn't work
[04:12:55] <FunkyBob> https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#server_name
[04:13:08] <PaulWay[w]> Jokes on you, you're still the one trying to figure it out :-)
[04:13:37] <Steve-Dusty> :rage:
[04:14:38] <PaulWay[w]> The question is: do you understand what name based virtual hosting is?  And how it works for you?
[04:15:05] <PaulWay[w]> Let's say you want portfolio.steve-dusty.com to be one site, and blog.steve-dusty.com to be another, right?
[04:16:58] <Steve-Dusty> yes..
[04:17:03] <Steve-Dusty> I just use 2 VPS
[04:17:07] <Steve-Dusty> i've done that before
[04:17:11] <PaulWay[w]> You don't have to.
[04:17:14] <PaulWay[w]> You can have them on one.
[04:17:19] <Steve-Dusty> oh...
[04:17:26] <Steve-Dusty> I wasted my github education pack credits then
[04:18:34] <PaulWay[w]> Do you see how this works?
[04:21:06] <Steve-Dusty> yes
[04:21:32] <PaulWay[w]> Anything you're unclear on?
[04:22:52] <PaulWay[w]> So here's a question: those two host names in DNS - portfolio.steve-dusty.com and blog.steve-dusty.com.  If both sites are hosted on the same server, what IP address do they have?
[04:23:28] <Steve-Dusty> same IP address
[04:23:36] <PaulWay[w]> Yep!  OK, good.
[04:23:47] <Steve-Dusty> what if you go to that IP address directly though
[04:24:13] <PaulWay[w]> There's probably a 'default' for the server.
[04:24:36] <PaulWay[w]> I don't know how nginx works.  IIRC Apache defaulted to the first host declared.
[04:25:21] <FunkyBob> iirc nginx is similar
[04:25:25] <FunkyBob> it'll be in the docs I linked
[04:25:38] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.
[04:25:57] <FunkyBob> "It is also possible to specify an empty server name (0.7.11):
[04:26:04] <FunkyBob> It allows this server to process requests without the ‚ÄúHost‚Äù header field ‚Äî instead of the default server ‚Äî for the given address:port pair. This is the default setting.
[04:26:06] <PaulWay[w]> In general going to the IP address directly is fairly meaningless.
[04:26:23] <FunkyBob> The default_server parameter, if present, will cause the server to become the default server for the specified address:port pair. If none of the directives have the default_server parameter then the first server with the address:port pair will be the default server for this pair.
[04:26:35] <Steve-Dusty> should I put my blog and portfolio together?
[04:26:38] <PaulWay[w]> Jeez, FunkyBob, use dpaste.org for that! :LOL:
[04:27:24] <PaulWay[w]> So having separate DNS names allows you to separate them onto different servers at some point in the future.
[04:28:02] <FunkyBob> i'd link directly to the docs if there were convenience headers/anchors
[04:28:12] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: indeed, it's possible to merge them...
[04:28:17] <FunkyBob> personally, I tend to use subdomains
[04:28:19] <PaulWay[w]> It's much harder to do that with something like http://steve-dusty.com/portfolio/ and http://steve-dusty.com/blog/
[04:28:34] <FunkyBob> but the way I do my VPS hosting makes it really simple to handle multiple sites
[04:28:37] <FunkyBob> deliberately so
[04:28:42] <FunkyBob> wow, the rain is belting down here
[04:28:48] <Steve-Dusty> or maybe blog just a functionality of my portfolioi
[04:28:55] <Steve-Dusty> but that'd be messy
[04:29:26] <Steve-Dusty> Do you know how to write mobile responsive CSS?
[04:29:26] <Steve-Dusty> or just bootstrap
[04:29:29] <FunkyBob> my blog is just one facet of my site
[04:29:41] <FunkyBob> I don't use bootstrap... i tend to write my CSS from scratch
[04:29:46] <FunkyBob> as you can see on my site :)
[04:29:52] <Steve-Dusty> i don't understand the code
[04:29:56] <Steve-Dusty> bceause there's no code
[04:30:01] <Steve-Dusty> i meant CSS
[04:30:03] <FunkyBob> sure there is
[04:30:13] <Steve-Dusty> in your Github it's just like how you see in docs
[04:30:18] <FunkyBob> it's just not an imperative syntax
[04:30:20] <PaulWay[w]> CSS is a declarative language.

[04:30:38] <Steve-Dusty> why dont I see somthing like `p{ background-color: red}`
[04:30:46] <Steve-Dusty> instead I see `" "" "" """s fesfsf s"""""""`
[04:30:52] <PaulWay[w]> ?!!!?!
[04:30:55] <FunkyBob> where?
[04:30:57] <Steve-Dusty> let me show you
[04:31:18] <FunkyBob> https://github.com/funkybob/kitty-litter/blob/master/pages/css/main.scss
[04:31:21] <FunkyBob> admittedly, this is SCSS...
[04:31:24] <FunkyBob> but close enough
[04:31:30] <Steve-Dusty> a bunch of YML I mean
[04:31:54] <FunkyBob> because my sites git repo contains the pre-rendered data for generating my site

[04:33:47] <Steve-Dusty> ??? Why would you ues a static generator? do you need a server or something?
[04:33:53] <Steve-Dusty> just use flask to serve it
[04:33:58] <schinckel> I use a static site generator too.
[04:33:59] <FunkyBob> even easier
[04:34:03] <FunkyBob> just use nginx  to serve it
[04:34:03] <Steve-Dusty> instead of 99999999 files
[04:34:09] <Steve-Dusty> wdym
[04:34:15] <schinckel> Then I can just upload files to a place that is super cheap to run.
[04:34:16] <Steve-Dusty> dont you run flask in nginx?
[04:34:18] <FunkyBob> I don't need flask or django or any app server
[04:34:20] <schinckel> Costs me 2c/month to host.
[04:34:23] <PaulWay[w]> OK, so here's the question Steve-Dusty: what do you think a static site generator is for?
[04:34:26] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: _nobody_ runs flask in nginx
[04:34:29] <FunkyBob> it's not possible
[04:34:33] <Steve-Dusty> wut
[04:34:41] <schinckel> Also, it's so fast to serve, even on dirt cheap hardware.
[04:34:44] <Steve-Dusty> then what do they do
[04:34:46] <schinckel> No database.
[04:34:49] <FunkyBob> you might run it _behind- nginx... with nginx proxying requests to it
[04:34:52] <FunkyBob> but not _in_ nginx
[04:35:06] <FunkyBob> they are separate processes
[04:35:08] <FunkyBob> separate programs
[04:35:09] <Steve-Dusty> I thought static site generator is like Wix where you type stuff and press generator and it generates a site for you
[04:35:20] <FunkyBob> Steve-Dusty: that's a site builder...
[04:35:25] <schinckel> I'd suggest Wix is _not_ a static site generator.
[04:35:29] <PaulWay[w]> We're talking about a blog - it basically contains content that is pre-written, blended together into the headers and footers that make the site.
[04:35:30] <PaulWay[w]> OK?
[04:35:41] <schinckel> I bet they may cache stuff, but it's all still database-driven.
[04:35:57] <FunkyBob> in my case, I don't even host the site
[04:36:05] <PaulWay[w]> Ultimately what that ends up is as chunks of HTML delivered to the browser.
[04:36:09] <FunkyBob> Netlify gets triggered on a git push... builds my site for me, and hosts it
[04:36:10] <FunkyBob> free
[04:36:15] <FunkyBob> this is one major benefit of a static site
[04:36:24] <Steve-Dusty> what do you put Flask on? pm2?
[04:36:27] <Steve-Dusty> process manager 2
[04:36:30] <FunkyBob> I don't use flask
[04:36:36] <Steve-Dusty> you've never used flask?
[04:36:37] <FunkyBob> odd to assume I would, talking in # DJANGO #

[04:47:37] <PaulWay[w]> Generally you can't title yourself 'sir' or 'commander' with approval.  Anything else is fair game.
[04:47:56] <PaulWay[w]> Is that the title you mean :-)
[04:49:50] <Steve-Dusty> on a website
[04:50:17] <FunkyBob> do you mean the <title> in the <head> ?
[04:51:13] <Steve-Dusty> yes
[04:51:33] <schinckel> Yeah, you'll want that. That's what determines what the browser shows in the title bar.
[04:51:38] <FunkyBob> last I checked technically it's required
[04:51:46] <FunkyBob> google will reward you for it
[04:51:54] <FunkyBob> and , yeah, it helps people know what that tab is
[04:51:57] <Steve-Dusty> i meant having different titles
[04:52:05] <FunkyBob> [unless like so many kids you have a bajillion tabs open]
[04:52:05] <Steve-Dusty> because im too lazy writing {% block title %}
[04:52:20] <Steve-Dusty> I have 40 tabs open
[04:52:39] <schinckel> I've done stuff where I put it into the context, and then have a default value for all of my pages, but allow an individual page to override it.
[04:52:48] <PaulWay[w]> And, yeah, titles help search engines know what the page is for.
[04:53:23] <Steve-Dusty> can I name it just homepage?
[04:53:45] <Steve-Dusty> or more specific
[04:53:48] <Steve-Dusty> idk how to write a title
[04:53:52] <Steve-Dusty> name it*

[11:07:24] <serafeim> let's suppose i've got a model that has an expensive method that should be called when the model is created or edited (or when the app starts) and cache its result. how would you recommend approaching this ?
[11:08:18] <dre> just add @cache everywhere
[11:08:22] <serafeim> my problem is the invalidation thingie or else i'd use something like django-memoize https://pythonhosted.org/django-memoize/
[11:08:39] <serafeim> dre: this will not help because i want invalidation when the model instance is saved
[11:09:04] <serafeim> if i blindly add @cache then the cache will return stale vvalues
[11:10:17] <dre> I thought django handled @cache on model save?
[11:10:27] <serafeim> lol of course not
[11:10:52] <serafeim> nobody handles cache invalidation
[11:11:37] <dre> I've assumed you've tried it and have found that it does indeed return stale values?
[11:11:50] <dre> in that case I would've just looked for a way to mark the cache to be invalid
[11:11:50] <serafeim> i don't need to try it i know
[11:12:00] <dre> but otherwise :shrug: no idea
[11:12:15] <serafeim> i'll probably need to override the model save method to invalidate the cache
[11:13:57] <dre> could be neat.
[11:14:11] <dre> I've got a problem where I'm trying to put a "wrapper" around the django "migrate" command
[11:14:26] <dre> so that it can assert for a certain condition
[11:14:47] <dre> is this possible in as few lines of code as possible or do I have to like, re-implement the migrate command
[11:14:59] <Kim^J> What do ou want to do?
[11:15:26] <dre> I want to assert that the correct environment value is set when a user runs "./manage.py migrate"
[11:17:21] <Kim^J> Uh, that sounds odd and error prone.
[11:17:32] <Kim^J> What are you trying to do?
[11:17:48] <dre> I'm literally asserting that the environment is correct to run migrate on.
[11:18:21] <dre> this seems to be what I want https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37754715/override-existing-django-admin-command
[11:21:04] <bin4ry> dre: is it better to use list of ID or list of Obj when calling .set?
[11:21:59] <dre> Kim^J, soz, i didn't mean to seem rude. but we have a lot of different configurations that are configured through envars, and not all of them can run migrations ;D
[11:22:23] <dre> bin4ry, I would say list of id, because it's shorter. the django ORM will sort out the objects for you.
[11:22:32] <dre> occasionally you might not need them at all.

[12:53:14] <LordVan> hi
[12:53:48] <LordVan> If i want a field added to a customized admin page that calls a method (i want to just pass a link to a "printable" view of the current admin) how would I best go about that?
[12:56:15] <GinFuyou> LordVan, easily. Depends which page you need it on
[12:58:07] <LordVan> GinFuyou, I just have my own class SheetAdmin(VersionAdmin)
[12:58:22] <LordVan> where i define filters and fields
[12:58:51] <LordVan> i just want a way to call my def printableViewUrl(self): which returns a url/string
[12:58:57] <GinFuyou> No idea what is VersionAdmin
[12:59:21] <GinFuyou> admin pages can use methods of model or admin for display
[12:59:37] <GinFuyou> in form views it has be added to read-only fields too
[12:59:59] <LordVan> how would you do it in a normal Admin ?
[13:00:05] <LordVan> VersionAdmin just adds a revision history
[13:01:38] <LordVan> I added a base.html which includes {% if printableViewUrl %}<a href="{{ printableViewUrl }}" target="_blank">Druckansicht</a>{% endif %}
[13:01:41] <LordVan> whichi  sprobably wrong
[13:01:49] <LordVan> but you get what i mean to do form that i think?
[13:02:27] <LordVan> VersioAdmin is from django-reversion
[13:02:49] <LordVan> and is a subclass of django.contrib.ModelAdmin
[13:03:56] <LordVan> i tried just creating a method like i said above
[13:04:06] <LordVan> but if i then try to use printableViewUrl() in the template i get
[13:04:24] <LordVan> Could not parse the remainder: '()' from 'printableViewUrl()'
[13:08:10] <FunkyBob> you don't use () in templates
[13:08:57] <GinFuyou> just add an admin method that takes object, and then add it name to list_display or whatever
[13:09:34] <GinFuyou> if it need to return html, use format_html to mark it safe
[13:09:50] <LordVan> just need the url itself
[13:10:02] <LordVan> but i could do it with format_html instead and generate the <a> tag
[13:10:02] <LordVan> hm
[13:11:37] <LordVan> i don'T want it in list_display i just want it to display a link on the top of the page
[13:11:45] <LordVan> right after content_title block in base.html

[13:21:15] <LordVan> i do not know how i would add it to the context?
[13:21:35] <LordVan> or to put it more clearly: where and how can I add this to my context for the admin page to be rendered?
[13:22:03] <GinFuyou> It somehow has to be in context yes. Possibly admin instance is already in a context (I don't remember but it's likely)
[13:22:03] <LordVan> if it was my own view i'd just add 'printableViewUrl': get_printableViewUrl(..), to the context
[13:22:41] <LordVan> yeah but my problem is I can't figure out how to add to the context here ;)
[13:22:54] <hylje> there's a method in modeladmin that you can override and put your stuff in the template context
[13:24:07] <LordVan> hylje, do you happen to know the name by any chance?^^
[13:24:39] <hylje> https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#other-methods

[14:44:42] <jmft2> Question: When should one use function-based views versus class-based views? Most of the examples I've found online use function-based views, but it seems that class-based views with their inheritance are _just better_.
[14:46:02] <hylje> functions are simpler and easier to read, while classes give you more stuff under the hood but you kinda need to know what's going on under the hood
[14:47:16] <jmft2> Is it a good idea to mix them?
[14:47:40] <hylje> doesn't matter, they all work the same as far as django is concerned
[14:47:48] <tm007> jmft2: most of the examples I've seen uses CBV.
[14:48:16] <tm007> The book Two Scoops of Django, CBV is strongly preferred.
[14:48:43] <hylje> i tend to use functions for one-off views (even if they get quite big), while class based stuff is great when i know i will have many variations on similar view functionality
[14:48:55] <tm007> jmft2: I personally don't like to mix.
[14:49:11] <tm007> Coherent code is easier to read.
[14:49:21] <tm007> Easier on my brain
[14:49:40] <tm007> Mine has less computation power
