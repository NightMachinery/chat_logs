[19:15:21] <Corbin> Yet another day where I think I need to reorder clauses. I wish my miniKanren had condi. Maybe I should figure out how to add it.
[19:17:24] <Corbin> ...I guess, reading through some posts like https://stackoverflow.com/q/10843563/264985 I should instead ask for this miniKanren library to implement a better conde instead?
[19:18:39] <Corbin> https://github.com/ThatGeoGuy/chicken-miniKanren/blob/master/mk.scm#L115-L118 if I'm reading this right, this is the *non-interleaving* bind, whereas I'd want the interleaving bind for the condi behavior, I think.
[19:32:00] <DeeEff_> Not sure I can immediately comment on everything, but you may find this SO answer helpful to understand why condi was removed: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67080915/clarify-search-algorithms-in-different-minikanren-implementation
[19:32:33] <DeeEff_> The conde I'm chicken's implementation is in fact the conde from TRS2
[19:33:26] <DeeEff_> I actually think it's a bit newer than that though because it incorporates some changes from fast-minikanren that didn't make it into TRS2
[20:58:04] <Corbin> Hm. So I suppose that I really do need to reorder clauses; I guess my search needs to either be fast in DFS or fast in BFS.
