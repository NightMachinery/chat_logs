[17:15:29] <xnaas> I guess the shortcuts plugin doesn't work on 4.3.1-rc.1
[17:15:39] <xnaas> that's...unfortunate
[17:15:51] <val> there's a shortcuts plugin?
[17:15:57] <xnaas> for aliases, yes
[17:16:12] <val> found it

[17:20:38] <xnaas> Censoring?! Lol
[17:20:48] <xnaas> Or just your terminal missing some emoji?
[17:20:51] <val> I don't see them in normal mode, but I do in raw mode
[17:20:55] <xnaas> Weird
[17:21:31] <val> could you try 👍?

[17:21:49] <val> uh, it works

[17:49:42] <bookworm> meaning, works as intended... even if it's annoying
[17:50:24] <xnaas> Kinda hard to test a plugin on the next version if it can't be done until release 😂
[17:52:57] <bookworm> yeah... the spec they say they are using actually orders it properly, but at least the tester here: https://semver.npmjs.com/ doesn't select the pre-release if >=4.3.x is supplied
[17:53:40] <bookworm> nor if you do >=4.3.0-rc.1 || >=4.3.x
[17:54:29] <bookworm> fuck it, I'm gonna trim the pre-release identifier prior to the comparison in TL and call it a day
