[02:15:33] <OnlineCop> Python2 question. Using python's regex module, I compile a regex like this: `re=regex.compile('''\{ (?=...stuff...) \}''',regex.X|regex.V1)` which works as expect.
[02:15:36] <OnlineCop> Now, I'd like to inject a reused pattern somewhere into `(?=...stuff...)`, which means that using `.format()` would break unless I change `\{` and `\}` to either `{{` and `}}` or `[{{]` and `[}}]`.
[02:16:15] <OnlineCop> That works fine, except if I've included `# line comments` within it. If those comments don't contain `{` or `}` then it compiles and works fine.
[02:17:06] <OnlineCop> However, if I have `# Match from { and 1st key iff this {...} contains only key-value pairs` then it doesn't like those unescaped/undoubled `{` characters.
[02:18:40] <OnlineCop> Should I change those comments to use `{{` and `}}` as well, or should I `regex.sub('\{\}', reused_pattern)` the compiled regex pattern?

[03:11:19] <OnlineCop> I'd hate to muddy comments up with "format()-friendly" notation since it kinda loses its meaning. On the other hand, if I could figure out how to just strip out the line comments within the compiled pattern, I could do that.
[03:18:41] <Timvde> OnlineCop: could you paste a small code snippet?

[03:49:20] <JohnDoe2> re101-koala-59 https://regex101.com/r/tB4y7m/1 you can loop through the matches to get them, or if you'd like we can name the capture group so you can refer to them by name, i.e. $matches['length']
[03:53:50] <re101-koala-59> No, just looking for an expression like this: (.+?)11\.6{1}(.+?)((?<![^a-zA-Z0-9_\u4e00-\u9fa5])(?=[^a-zA-Z0-9_\u4e00-\u9fa5])|(?<=[^a-zA-Z0-9_\u4e00-\u9fa5])(?![^a-zA-Z0-9_\u4e00-\u9fa5])|$)

[03:55:29] <re101-koala-59> is source string same as original text?
[03:55:48] <JohnDoe2> yeah essentially what you're working with
[03:56:56] <re101-koala-59> I scraped this from my vendor's website: 11.6in X 15.4in X 7.4in
[03:57:41] <re101-koala-59> i created three columns, each containing an single instance of this

[03:58:54] <JohnDoe2> well the link I pasted matches each one of the three individually

[03:59:30] <JohnDoe2> https://regex101.com/r/tB4y7m/1 <<< this is an actual regex
[03:59:42] <JohnDoe2> if you click it you'll see what it does, live
[04:00:12] <re101-koala-59> yes, I was checking that out. Thx. 
[04:00:24] <re101-koala-59> Hmmm... so we have three matches. 
[04:00:30] <JohnDoe2> yup
[04:00:44] <re101-koala-59> is there an expression that would isolate match1?
[04:00:48] <JohnDoe2> the'll appear as $matches[0][0], $matches[1][0] and [2][1]
[04:01:27] <re101-koala-59> likewise an expression to isolate match2
[04:01:35] <re101-koala-59> Am I making sense?
[04:01:37] <JohnDoe2> the 3 matches are not one string, they're 3 separate array items
[04:03:32] <re101-koala-59> (trying to think about how to best word my question as Im not a programmer) 
[04:03:53] <JohnDoe2> the question is not the problem, it's how you're going to do it
[04:04:18] <re101-koala-59> heres what Im doing. 
[04:04:18] <Dus10> Trinity said otherwise
[04:04:49] <JohnDoe2> and whether that's through looping $matches or by running these one at a time .. is entirely up to you https://regex101.com/r/tB4y7m/2
[04:05:04] <re101-koala-59> I have a tool called RegEx Tool. I plug in 11.6in X 15.4in X 7.4in into the Original Text Box. I put [\d.,]+ into the Regular Expression box. 
[04:05:04] <JohnDoe2> each item up to | is an expression.
[04:05:34] <re101-koala-59> Press the Match button, and receive 11.6 as the result. 
[04:05:53] <re101-koala-59> The first array, I think you called it. 
[04:06:12] <JohnDoe2> right so you're doing this manually then.
[04:06:18] <re101-koala-59> correct
[04:06:48] <re101-koala-59> At this point, I would like an expression that returns the 2nd array. 
[04:07:01] <re101-koala-59> and another expression that returns the 3rd. 
[04:07:12] <re101-koala-59> three different expressions. 
[04:07:20] <JohnDoe2> that's version /2 - the second link I sent you
[04:07:35] <JohnDoe2> each item between | is an expression, copy paste each of them to get the other 2 parts
[04:07:53] <JohnDoe2> or turn on global flag in the regex tool you're using
[04:07:57] <JohnDoe2> to get more than the first match
[04:09:21] <re101-koala-59> Thanks, let me play with this a bit. 
[04:09:37] <re101-koala-59> This learning curve... whew. 
[04:10:07] <JohnDoe2> yup. If you have like 20,000 products it's very much not worth doing it by hand
[04:11:46] <re101-koala-59> The scraping software will auto apply it to each cell on save, I just need to tell it what expression to apply. 
[04:11:52] <JohnDoe2> ok
[04:15:07] <re101-koala-59> Could you resend the 2nd link you referred to? I think that copy/paste didnt take

[04:29:54] <re101-koala-59> May have spoken too soon. It's fine with the first array and the third array, but X \K[\d,.]+in X is not returning the middle array.
[04:30:36] <re101-koala-59> Works fine in the link though.

[21:13:21] <re101-bombay-60> Hello
[21:13:46] <re101-bombay-60> !rehelp
[21:13:46] <perlbot> Please share a https://regex101.com/ link containing your regex and sample data, stay as long as possible, and we'll do our best to assist you ASAP.
[21:16:23] <re101-bombay-60> https://regex101.com/
[21:16:52] <purplex> forgot to save it
[21:17:10] <re101-bombay-60> oops
[21:17:31] <re101-bombay-60> Hi Team I am looking for a regex pattern which can help to replace any string of my data of paragraph with *. With the help of start and end positions. All those positions must be replaced with *.
[21:18:00] <re101-bombay-60> Let us say str = My name is Alex.
[21:18:21] <re101-bombay-60> i want to mask the data from position 0 to 10 with "*"
[21:18:36] <re101-bombay-60> ********** Alex.
[21:18:45] <re101-bombay-60> output shall be as above
[21:23:55] <purplex> based on char position? hm
[21:24:33] <re101-bombay-60> yes right 
[21:25:09] <re101-bombay-60> character can be anythg including special character number or alphabet or alphanumeric value..
[21:26:08] <re101-bombay-60> but setting the position in regex to mask values should be dynamic .. 
[21:26:14] <purplex> sounds like programming language would be good for this task, in regex i can't say * positions 0 to 10
[21:26:39] <re101-bombay-60> i think if 0 to 10 is added in the regex
[21:26:57] <re101-bombay-60> that can be replaced with some other positions too
[21:26:59] <re101-bombay-60> right?
[21:27:21] <re101-bombay-60> i.e. 3 to 7 for example
[21:28:36] <digitok> !regex s/(?:^.{0}|\G(?!^))(?<!.{10})./*/g My name is Alex.
[21:28:37] <rebot> 14digitok: Result: 1410 replacements (187 steps, ~0ms). Output: 07********** Alex.
[21:28:54] <digitok> !regex s/(?:^.{3}|\G(?!^))(?<!.{7})./*/g My name is Alex.
[21:28:55] <rebot> 14digitok: Result: 144 replacements (79 steps, ~0ms). Output: 07**** is Alex.
[21:29:34] <re101-bombay-60> :(  why 4 replacements for 3 to 7
[21:29:38] <digitok> !regex s/(?:^.{3}|\G(?!^))(?<!.{7})\K./*/g My name is Alex.
[21:29:39] <rebot> 14digitok: Result: 144 replacements (86 steps, ~0ms). Output: 07My **** is Alex.
[21:30:02] <re101-bombay-60> yes this looks as expected :)  
[21:31:47] <re101-bombay-60> one question can i replace the numbers with variable and pass it as input in js script?
[21:31:57] <digitok> nope
[21:32:11] <digitok> this requires pcre
[21:32:23] <digitok> if you're using js why use regex?
[21:34:02] <purplex> yes 10x easy in js to replace
[21:34:21] <re101-bombay-60> i want to keep  both as an option
[21:34:37] <re101-bombay-60> can you also give the same example in js ?
[21:34:47] <re101-bombay-60> i am new to js actually
[21:37:04] <digitok> "My name is Alex.".replace(/(.{3})(.{4})/,(m,g1,g2) => { return g1+g2.replace(/./g,"*"); });
[21:37:16] <digitok> it's still regex hehe
[21:37:24] <digitok> 4 = 7-3
[21:37:52] <re101-bombay-60> :D  yes 
[21:38:05] <re101-bombay-60> let me try both of these options..
[21:38:14] <digitok> "My name is Alex.".replace(new RegExp("(.{3})(.{4})"),(m,g1,g2) => { return g1+g2.replace(/./g,"*"); });
[21:39:33] <digitok> this one actually, you can then use "(.{"+n1+"})(.{"+(n2-n1)+"})"
[21:39:40] <digitok> for the regex
[21:40:38] <re101-bombay-60> oh my god 
[21:40:40] <digitok> .replace(new RegExp("(.{"+n1+"})(.{"+(n2-n1)+"})"),(m,g1,g2) => { return g1+g2.replace(/./g,"*"); });
[21:40:45] <digitok> like thay
[21:40:48] <digitok> that*
[21:41:26] <re101-bombay-60> what is g1 & g2 in the above expression?
[21:41:54] <digitok> m is the full match, g1 and g2 are the groups
[21:42:09] <digitok> groups being the parts inside ()
[21:42:22] <re101-bombay-60> ok 
[21:43:30] <digitok> so we return group 1 unchanged and group2 with each char replaced with *
[21:44:51] <re101-bombay-60> oh i see
[21:44:57] <digitok> .replace(new RegExp("(?<=.{"+n1+"}).{"+(n2-n1)+"}"),(m) => { return m.replace(/./g,"*"); });
[21:45:14] <digitok> it can also be written like that if you're using ES6
[21:45:26] <digitok> which supports lookbehind
[21:47:03] <re101-bombay-60> n1 n2 are the positions? right?
[21:48:06] <digitok> yep
[21:49:45] *** Quits: ray (~ray@user/re) (Quit: WeeChat 3.1)
[21:50:56] <re101-bombay-60> hi
[21:51:24] <digitok> it could also be done by just joining the 3 substrings together and applying .replace(/./g,"*") to the 2nd one
[21:51:47] <re101-bombay-60> i have a doubt
[21:51:50] <re101-bombay-60> Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument lis
[21:51:59] <re101-bombay-60> i am getting this error
[21:52:13] <re101-bombay-60> str1.replace(new RegExp("(.{"3"})(.{"+(6-3)+"})"),(m,g1,g2)=> { return g1+g2.replace(/./g,"*"); });
[21:52:18] <re101-bombay-60> for this
[21:53:03] <digitok> "+3+"
[21:53:04] <re101-bombay-60> simply was testing on console
[21:53:27] <re101-bombay-60> oh + has to be included
[21:53:30] <re101-bombay-60> alright
[21:53:46] <digitok> or remove the quotes
[21:54:03] <digitok> it's needed if you're using vars
[21:54:38] *** Joins: ray (~ray@user/re)
[21:55:55] <re101-bombay-60> alright ... also if i am using some input parameter in the js for the positions then i can add it in this template right using the quotes?
[21:56:32] <digitok> yep that's what n1 and n2 were
[21:56:38] <digitok> they'd be variables
[21:56:47] <digitok> 3 and 6 in your example
[21:58:48] <re101-bombay-60> ok great 
[21:58:53] <re101-bombay-60> i will try them
[21:59:02] <re101-bombay-60> really helpful :)  
[21:59:07] <re101-bombay-60> thanks alot
