[03:20:09] <tomreyn> Joanna: i think they don'T understand each others language out of the box
[03:20:56] <tomreyn> but they may sound somewhat similar. dutch accent also sounds quite similar
[03:21:40] <B4ckBOne> Some words are easy to understand. Im German
[03:21:50] <B4ckBOne> But a lot are not.
[03:21:58] <B4ckBOne> Its from the Latin tree of languages.
[03:22:10] <Joanna> Their languages have a common ancestor but then again English is Germanic languages + French and I don’t understand those too well
[03:22:18] <shibboleth> Joanna, really?
[03:22:41] <shibboleth> Joanna, it's true, danish is a germanic language, so are the two other languages
[03:22:58] <shibboleth> and let them tell ya, danish (oral/vocal) is messed up
[03:23:35] <Joanna> French is from Latin as is Spanish,Italian,Romanian Portuguese and maybe russian..
[03:24:09] <shibboleth> danish is, in writing, very similar to norwegian, yet norwegian is orally, vocally more similar to swedish
[03:24:54] <shibboleth> and danish, orally/vocally is... hilarious if you're familiar with he two other languages

[03:36:36] <shibboleth> they even have this... weird/unique approach to numbera. "85" in english: "eighty-five", swedish "attiofem", nor: "attifem", danish: "fem-halv-firs"

[03:38:45] <shibboleth> because, somehow... "fems"/fives, being half of ten (multiple of 100), and "half firs" (half fours) is... for some reason 90
[03:39:10] <shibboleth> sorry, "halv fems"/ (half fives)
[03:39:29] <shibboleth> why? well... who knows
[03:40:38] <tomreyn> still less crazy than french counting
[03:41:12] <shibboleth> enlighten me
[03:41:22] <tolarz> yeah, that's what I figured: a language that is related to German, but not quite German
[03:42:21] <tomreyn> shibboleth: look at 80-100 https://blog.rosettastone.com/learn-french-numbers-1-100-with-these-french-counting-tips/
[03:42:22] <secbot> ^ Learn French Numbers 1-100 | Rosetta Stone®
[03:42:50] <shibboleth> tolarz, and ends up, in writing close to *identical* to norwegian but orally, like norwegian but if everyone were "retarded"
[03:45:35] <tomreyn> shibboleth: also 70-79: 'French counting rules start to get a little tricky with the number 70. In French, instead of having a different number for 70 like there is for 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60, you’ll use “sixty-ten” instead. After sixty-ten, or soixante-dix, you’ll keep tacking numbers ten through 19 on the end of 60 until you get to eighty.'
[03:46:47] <tomreyn> my explanation is that they just forgot to introduce a word for 70 and then later fixed it by using a variant on top of 60
[03:47:14] <shibboleth> so, similarly to danish, where "70" is "halv-firs" (half-fours)
[03:47:37] <shibboleth> because 4x20 (yeah) is eighty
[03:47:38] <tomreyn> hmm yes, i guess so. also weird

[03:48:52] <Joanna> I can read French because it’s similar to Spanish

[03:56:07] <shibboleth> and while german may appear... mostly intelligle to nordic readers, there's no way they'll be able to formulate sentences sentences in german without a who lot of training
[03:57:05] <shibboleth> same with dutch. and dutch is the language most similar to german, not danish. and germans will tell you dutch is like german but if there was lead in the water
[03:58:37] <mats1> and i thought german was aggressive already
[04:00:55] <shibboleth> the old joke about dutch: if you're gonna be talking to a dutchman: bring a handkerchief
[04:01:33] <shibboleth> they have this weird thing going on with their throats and you better be fully vaccinated (covid)
[04:06:11] <shibboleth> and ask a dane, they'll tell you .no sounds retarded. that's mostly (from what i've been told) a gripe they have with the "oslo-dialect" which has this... melody to it (like swedish). think..."california-up-talk"

[18:27:15] <minall> But quite a point youre making. So how trolled? ww86
[18:27:40] <ww86> I can't give a single concise definition. For an example if I download mp3 files to listen on my mobile phone while at work, they're usually modified in such a way that listening to them gets annoying.
[18:28:23] <ww86> It's essentially a combination of some effects which are achieved by means of hacking, and having troll persons engage with me over social media. In this case these troll persons would be civilian recruits for the Russians.

[18:47:30] <ww86> Whether or not you find this credible, my experience is that the Finnish society has lots of civilians who have ended up being part of the Russians' contact networks and will do their bidding. This most certainly extends to all telephone companies in the country.

[18:52:18] <ajak> anyone skilled enough to target you would've just stolen your passwords or something and in general done stuff more quietly
[18:52:46] <Joanna> What is Finlandisation ?
[18:52:53] <ww86> This can be a factor in how this case has progressed. I've had 2 hypotheses related to why the Russians started to mess with me in the first place, and I don't know if either of them is correct. The first one is that it was related to my blog, and the second is that it has to do with my brother, who is in a fairly influential position.
[18:53:36] <ajak> so you're hypothesizing why the russians have gone after you (and your mp3s)
[18:53:42] <ajak> do you have evidence that it actually is russia?
[18:54:01] <ww86> Finladisation, or "Finlandzierung", the word comes from German. It refers to the political state of our country during the Cold War, in which the KGB got a major grip from the political life of our country. This is characterized by a situation, where politicians and people elsewhere in the society, were engaging in self-censorship and abstained
[18:54:02] <ww86> from being critical of the Soviet Union.
[18:54:54] <ww86> Ajak, other than there being one Estonian-Russian guy who told me in person that "We are going to kill you" and by deductive reasoning based on circumstantial factors - Such that the only source of such influence in our society can be Russia.

[18:56:13] <ww86> Unfortunately this harassment problem is not limited to just online, which is why the events in person corroborate that it is the Russians

[18:57:06] <tomreyn> what's generally known in europe is that finland is rather worried about the influence russia has on the country, and, as it seems, for good reasons. generally, russia is doing an info war on europe since putin got angry about the nato's continued progress towards the east, and into former UdSSR countries.
[18:57:09] <ajak> they might not like it sure but there are bigger fish to care about than some guy that wrote something in finland
[18:57:55] <ww86> Ajak, okay. You're entitled to holding such a belief about how the Russians go about their business, but do you actually know anything about the topic, such as what kind of people are typically targeted?
[18:58:13] <ajak> you're right i don't know anything about the topic

[18:59:43] <ww86> Okay. You don't have to find what I'm saying credible. I'd just have to laboriously describe extensive accounts of things that happened over the course of this problem. Can we just pretend or consider it as a thought-experiment, from the perspective, "assuming it was true that I was trolled by the Russians, then..." ... What could I do in that
[18:59:43] <ww86> case?
[18:59:50] <Joanna> ww86: if you have people in person threatening to kill you that is a much bigger problem than garbled mp3 files I think..
[19:00:06] <ajak> state sponsored hackers have better things to do than "troll" people
[19:00:36] <ajak> especially if state agents have come into physical contact with you, like Joanna says
[19:00:39] <ww86> Joanna, that event is more complicated than what I let you know about it. But it still goes into this case, and I have told the Finnish counter-intelligence about this incident. I suspect they can't do anything about it, and so far apparently haven't.
[19:00:53] <ajak> they wouldn't tell you if they did :p
[19:01:43] <Joanna> Can’t your brother help if he has influence?

[19:02:43] <ww86> I'm not looking forward to convince people first and foremost. If I wanted to that then I would choose a different method, tomreyn. But I suppose that would be a valid thing to attempt...
[19:02:48] <Joanna> What does mp3 file sound like and does it happen to all mp3 files the same ?
[19:04:31] <ww86> The edits are such that if you take the transcript of what is said, it is intact. Like if I download a lecture, and write down each word and speaker, none of those things have changed. But instead it's things like how the people in the file are saying things, such as laborious breathing sounds, smacking sounds of the mouth, over-pronouncing some
[19:04:32] <ww86> sounds like the "s" or things of that sort. There's probably a reason for doing it in that particular manner.
[19:05:11] <ww86> ...My guess is that for someone to look into it, they'd need to be able to do more than look at such a transcript. Which would take time and resources.
[19:05:59] <ww86> The overall result is regardless, that they're annoying to listen to. And it's kind of difficult to put your finger on what it is exactly that's wrong with them, since they're things of that sort.
[19:06:12] <Joanna> Are the extra sounds added or the original sounds distorted do you think?
[19:06:47] <ww86> I think it's original sounds distorted, more likely anyway. It's hard to tell for sure if something like that is extra or not.

[19:10:39] <ww86> Alright, you don't have to believe me. But at least you can see that it could be done, if someone wanted to do it that way, could you not, Tomreyn?
[19:10:44] <tomreyn> you should replace the router / network access devices,  you should do bios updates on all of your computers at the same time as replacing the router.
[19:10:48] <Joanna> tomreyn: I’ve heard stories about the stazi sneaking into homes and messing with stuff to get family members to accuse and fight with eachother so who knows..
[19:11:06] <ajak> people with evidence know
[19:11:13] <ww86> Joanna, that method is called "Zersetsung" by the way, and also, STASI was controlled by the Russians
[19:11:25] <Joanna> Indeed
[19:11:30] <tomreyn> you should reinstall the operating systems on all computers (that means reinstalling android /resetting ios on mobile devices)
[19:12:26] <Joanna> I didn’t know it had a name !! Most of my knowledge of stazi came from the lives of others movie so can guarantee how accurate it is..
[19:13:17] <kulesh> АХТУНГ АХТУНГ
[19:13:23] <kulesh> АЛАРМ
[19:13:26] <tomreyn> zersetzung just means disruptiveness, which is a standard tactic of every secret service, i would think
[19:13:29] <kulesh> ...
[19:13:43] <Joanna> tomreyn: cointelpro also
[19:14:05] <ww86> STASI was founded by the NKVD after Soviet Union took over East-Germany and Germany was split. NKVD is the Stalin era predecessor of the KGB. They appointed two directors, Erich Mielke and Markus Wolf to head the STASI, both of whom were presumably on NKVD payroll before the appointment. Additionally there were liaison officers of the  (later) KGB
[19:14:06] <ww86> placed within STASI to keep things under control.
[19:14:33] <tomreyn> ww86: did you see the recommendations above? are you interested in those?
[19:14:41] <ww86> Zersetsung means "biodegradation", which was a specific method used by the STASI, in which the goal was to drive a person mad, or disable their political or otherwise unwanted activities, while maintaining plausible deniability, tomreyn

[19:27:47] <tomreyn> the idea of 'resetting devices' was really just to get an indication of whether they're a target. if there is someone trying to constantly harass them, and including through IT measures, then they'd want to reestablish their access to these systems, which involves new measures on their part, and would decrease their access level until then. and it's a cheap/free measure that you can pull off in a day.

[19:29:19] <ww86> Joanna I wasn't really looking to annoy the Russians in the first place. It's more like what I did was overall rather benign, and I think I might've been targeted for recruitment or something along those lines. But things got complicated
