[00:18:52] <newpy> so %ebp has the old stack pointer
[00:18:55] <newpy> we move it to %esp
[00:19:17] <newpy> what is the old stack pointer pointing to? the ebp that was pushed onto the stack?
[00:19:45] <jeaye> The stack frame of the previous function you were in.
[00:20:12] <Decker> no ebp is actually 'this' stack pointer... and the value at ebp-4 is the previous 'this' stack pointer
[00:20:35] <Decker> it's more a convention of the ABI
[00:20:49] <Decker> it shouldn't have been an instruction but
[00:21:11] <Decker> like 'why should the CPU know anything about ABI?!'
[00:21:52] <newpy> ok so to make a function call I push parameters onto the stack
[00:22:10] <newpy> well store the stack pointer in ebp, then push parameters,
[00:22:22] <newpy> then jump to the function
[00:22:27] <GeDaMo> Depends on the calling convention
[00:22:36] <jeaye> Params can also go into registers.
[00:22:38] <GeDaMo> x86-64 conventions pass parameters in the registers

[00:23:16] <newpy> ok
[00:23:29] <newpy> then when I'm done, I move ebp back to esp
[00:23:41] <newpy> why pop %ebp after?
[00:23:50] <Decker> call to the instruction
[00:23:57] <Decker> call pushes the isntruction after the call for you
[00:24:07] <Decker> so you can resume where you left off

[03:15:07] <jeaye> Clojure is lispy and is definitely functional-first. The standard library is almost entirely purely functional, the default data structures are all persistent and immutable, and any mutation that is done is transactional and still based on immutable values.

[03:24:30] <jeaye> The problem with CL is that everyone writes it differently. All the old CL programmers don't write CL; they write some custom DSL of CL they've concocted over the years.
[03:25:48] <oldlaptop> which is a large part of the point
[03:26:00] <jeaye> CL also lacks two _really_ key things: good persistent data structures (vector, map, set) and a generic interface for working with data. For the latter, what I mean is that, in CL, you need to know if the data you're working on is a vector or a map or a set. In Clojure, all you need to know is if the data is associative or a sequence or some other form of abstraction.

[04:53:59] <kveroneau> Oh.  Linux is a bit more tricky in that department.  I personally use the Lazarus IDE, which uses ObjectPascal as it's programming language to develop GUI apps on Linux(which also compile to other popular OSes)
[04:54:03] <jollygood2> might as well jump into C# right away, if your using VS on windows. a lot more people use it, and you'll get help easier

[04:54:43] <jinsun> Qt has their own stuff for gui that is cross platform, Qt creator and designer
[04:55:28] <tomathy> i tried Glade which was nice but i couldn't be bothered when it told me i need 10 libraries to run the program
[04:55:49] <tomathy> and to download and install all these different things which they didnt even link to
[04:56:19] <smallville7123> Decker: imma just rename depth to length, so we have       height x width x length
[04:56:39] <kveroneau> tomathy, yeah you'll see that with a lot of programming environments.  That's also why I use Lazarus, it generates static ELF binaries unless you enable threads, then it needs to link out to glibc and such for that to work correctly.
[04:57:25] <kveroneau> Well, that's partly right.  Other libraries in Lazarus, such as OpenSSL among others will need to dynamically link to a library you probably have installed already.

[05:21:26] <newpy> I'm confused by line 9, it's growing the stack, but then when the function stores x+y in local, it uses -4(%ebp), is that where local is?

[05:23:14] <newpy> we move %esp to %ebp, so %ebp points to the stored previous stack frame
[05:23:43] <newpy> 8(%ebp) should point to the parameter, but what's at 4(%ebp)?

[11:49:37] <aoei\Chickatrice> but the Deployment checklist might still be useful
[11:49:50] <aoei\Chickatrice> and you will need to have a django server running locally on something like port 8088
[11:49:55] <aoei\Chickatrice> er, server-local
[11:50:02] <aoei\Chickatrice> as in the same server as nginx
[11:50:09] <Decker> then that one wouldn't log
[11:50:27] <aoei\Chickatrice> anyway, once oyu hvae that you put a rewrite rule in nginx.conf to proxy connections

[12:40:24] <arahael> fweht: Some languages do have the capability to be somewhat flexible with loops like that, eg, you could SIMD them, but that's still CPU, I don't know of any that will magically move them to the GPU.

[18:48:00] <Rounin> They need to add the getters and setters so that they can make types out of all their data because that's what they do in the books and conferences
[18:48:54] <Guest42> Rounin: I think I got a bit confused, right now I'm thinking of having the abstract class have collections of some interface Data, without specifying what that is

[18:59:19] <Rounin> Anyway, one way to solve it is to make a getTheArray() method and just take the performance hit... Another is to make all the classes just be the same type
