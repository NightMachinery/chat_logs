[06:18:59] <Kiernian> tiff files in particular seem to take the downgrade of dpi quality extremely poorly. a few steps in the lower number direction and you've gone from scan to something that looks like someone printed it out in 1988, photocopied it, photocopied that photocopy, then faxed it, and THEN scanned it in.
