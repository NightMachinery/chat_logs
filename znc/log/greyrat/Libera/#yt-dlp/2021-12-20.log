[00:03:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Might be nice to have the same connection retry logic on live_chat downloading as there is on video/audio downloading.

[15:38:11] <msiism> Would be nice if yt-dlp respected the NO_COLOR environment variable. Cf. https://no-color.org/
[15:53:44] <FoH> try TERM=dumb.  If it uses terminfo to determine how to render colour (which many things annoyingly don't), it should work.
[15:54:52] <msiism> Well, okay. I means, there's also an option to disable colors.
[15:55:28] <msiism> I was just trying to, possibly maybe, advance the "standard".
[15:55:42] <FoH> nice idea :)
[15:56:28] <msiism> :)
[15:56:42] <FoH> I don't mind colours, except that sometimes the choices are not compatible with my red-deficient eyes.
[15:58:34] <msiism> I'm not generally opposed to colors either. It's just that the way terminals as I know them (terminal emulators) make them happen is a bit odd.
[15:58:46] <msiism> So, I like to be able to keep them at bay easily.
[15:59:31] <ede> colors are the spice of visual text output, should be used wisely (or not at all at the user's discretion).
