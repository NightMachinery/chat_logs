[03:03:02] <harlan> "
[03:03:05] <simcop2387> harlan: they don't really call it release engineering, but there's a "Pumpking" that does each actual perl release
[03:03:06] <harlan> "of perl"
[03:03:14] <harlan> thanks!
[03:04:18] <LeoNerd> Hrm.. I'm not sure we really have a pumpking any more
[03:04:27] <xenu> if you want to report a bug, the best place is here: https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues
[03:04:28] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ Issues · Perl/perl5 · GitHub ]
[03:05:33] <LeoNerd> The release manager for each version is picked on a fairly random volunteer basis, just as a formallity to actually do the work and press some buttons (there are lots of buttons)
[03:05:35] <harlan> It's a lack of documentation issue, and I have never had any luck getting those fixed :)
[03:05:44] <LeoNerd> The overall language direction is set by the PSC now
[03:05:55] <xenu> which reminds me, since it was agreed perl 7 is a thing that will happen at some point, we should rename the repo
[03:05:57] <harlan> I'm trying to reach somebody who can shed a little "how-to" light.
[03:06:16] <simcop2387> harlan: lack of documentation on what?
[03:06:23] <simcop2387> we might be able to help with that
[03:06:50] <daemon> perlbot metacpan app::plenv
[03:06:51] <perlbot> daemon: No factoid found. Did you mean one of these: [metacpan] [metacpan bug]
[03:07:01] <harlan> I'm installing a new version of openssl, so I want to tell COnfigure to look for those headers/libs first. I' have tried all my old tricks, and perl keeps getting build with the system openssl.
[03:07:11] <LeoNerd> xenu: Oh,.. yeah we should get rid of the '5' sometime. The perl repo isn't too difficult. I'm actually more worried how we're gonna handle the mailing list (perl5-porters@) or the IRC channel (#p5p)
[03:07:29] <LeoNerd> We can easily be  perl-porters@perl.org  but I don't fancy being on IRC in #pp
[03:07:31] <LeoNerd> :)
[03:07:34] <xenu> btw if you rename the repo on github, the old name will continue work as an alias which is helpful
[03:08:01] <simcop2387> until something replaces it of course
[03:08:11] <LeoNerd> Though maybe at that point it might make sense to revisit the concept of "porters" as a name, and find a better word overall
[03:08:27] <harlan> Since perl has the info built in, when I go to install CPAN stuff (like Net-SSL-SOmething) it fails because it's using the wrong hearders/libraries.
[03:08:38] <LeoNerd> I don't know about anyone else, but I don't spend my days sorting people's mail and handing out keys
[03:09:29] <simcop2387> i don't think perl actually includes any ssl stuff by default does it? usually it's ssleay and such that gets used
[03:09:47] <harlan> perl has info in it that tells CPAN moduled where to go for headers and libs...
[03:09:51] <LeoNerd> Yeah, currently not. That's sortof a problem that needs attacking but between us I don't know if we have any spare cycles before 5.36
[03:09:53] <xenu> simcop2387: it doesn't, but perl does manage include paths (in Config.pm)
[03:09:55] <harlan> at least, as best as I can see.
[03:09:59] <LeoNerd> I'm all out on this signatures task currently
[03:10:04] <xenu> and Net::SSLeay or whatever it's called certainly uses that
[03:11:11] <simcop2387> harlan: as a hack you can edit that Config.pm, but i think there's a way to point it there as part of the ./Configure script
[03:11:38] <leont> That 5 sticks his head up in the weirdest of places, renaming to 7 will be full of surprising headaches
[03:11:47] <leont> You know, stuff like install_base paths
[03:12:09] <LeoNerd> Ohyeah I'm sure we'll be suffering the '5' for yeeeears
[03:12:14] <harlan> yes, and while I CAN do that, that's horrible for production.  I have tried Configure -A prepend:incpth-'...'
[03:12:36] <harlan> and LDFLAGS and CFLAGS and ... and nothing seems to work.
[03:12:50] <harlan> that was ...incpth='...'
[03:13:14] <simcop2387> harlan: try, -A prepend:locincpath="..."
[03:13:16] <xenu> incpth is just for headers, you also want libpth
[03:13:26] <simcop2387> and that too.  don't listen to me
[03:13:43] <harlan> I do libpth too - so far hasn't helped.  But I'll try locincpth (or locincpath)
[03:14:06] <xenu> also there should be a way to override just for EU::MM or M::B
[03:14:37] <harlan> I gather that foopth='a:b' is supposed to work, but it doesn;'t for me.  I just use multiple -A args

[05:56:26] <x5c30> that's a bit tougher and would need some homework, but as far as i'm aware that is a widely-enough implemented thing you should be ok. maybe slightly better would be chacha20poly1305 with ietf padding as that at least has an rfc (8439), i'm not sure if that module offers it
[05:57:13] <FlorianBad> well, I'll make my own headers anyway, because I have some Argon2 and so on on top of that, so I have things to write anyway

[05:58:17] <x5c30> if you're going all in, one more thing you might want to consider is doing block sizes of say 32 kb or whatever (something reasonable for in-memory), have that block size in your validated header, and do the encryption by chunking block after block
[05:58:51] <x5c30> otherwise, i know you mentioned like 100 GB files, with the just stream it all method at decryption time, you don't know whether any of it was bad until processing the whole thing and checking the mac

[06:11:04] <FlorianBad> x5c30: one thing I'm very concerned about is the ability to decode it 30 years from now, with that module gone for example (or even perl let's say). I want to use the most standard chacha20 encryption possible after my headers, so that everything that follows my headers is really just the encrypted data with nothing else, and another program would
[06:11:05] <FlorianBad> have produced the same bytes.

[06:15:25] <x5c30> FlorianBad: keep a copy of (all of) the code, what compiled it, a copy of the algorithms, and really an understanding of how the implementation does it is so you can reproduce it later. these are standard enough they should still be around in some form for quite a while, even if it takes some doing to get old software running.

[06:18:41] <FlorianBad> x5c30: does cpan compile things native by default? Should I copy a perl directory from /usr/something?  I do plan to make a tgz that contains all my programs, some doc, and everything that might be needed to help decrypt 30 years from now (from mars), and since these will be huge files I don't mind storing a few MB of tools next to each of them
[06:19:37] *** Joins: Su-Shee (~Susanne@p4ffc7924.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[06:20:47] <FlorianBad> I'll even put some explanation about the format in the headers of the file itself, which I'll have in a text format, kind of like an email with final \n\n or something, but the data that follows that has to be STANDARD Chacha20, not some custom implementation of it...
[06:21:50] *** Quits: asdflkj_sh (~asdflkj@bsdforall.org) (Quit: WeeChat 3.1)
[06:26:20] <x5c30> it compiles things in the same way perl itself was compiled by default, so you'll have to keep in mind having the computer to run it on, all the dependencies on the os (libc, etc)...these are hard problems when you want data to be accessible for long stretches, and there's lots to consider
[06:27:25] <x5c30> there's a lot to weigh, and it's best to keep in mind that you may knowingly have to move formats to something to stay accessible and prepare for it...if this is stored on someone else's stuff over the internet that's a consideration too...if i had put important stuff on geocities decades ago...
[06:27:43] <FlorianBad> Do you think Crypt::AuthEnc::ChaCha20Poly1305 produces the same encrypted bytes as another implementations (excluding any headers or padding of course) ?
[06:27:57] *** Quits: geowiesnot (~user@5-51-190-244.abo.bbox.fr) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[06:28:08] <x5c30> it should, xchacha20poly1305 with ietf padding is on standards track in that rfc
[06:28:41] <x5c30> and i think all you have to do to use that one is 96 bit nonce and 256 bit key
[06:29:03] <FlorianBad> I see. Well that's what I will need to figure out mostly, I'm going to have to find 2-3 other tools to compare the bytes
[06:29:36] <x5c30> yup definitely a good idea, and remember you're going to want to check on things once in a while down the road too, make sure it still works
[06:30:54] <FlorianBad> ok. If my 256 key is an Argon2 thing with a random salt of 16 bytes, do you think it's ok to use that for IV/nonce or it's better to generate another random 12 bytes and store them along the argon salt in the headers?
[06:31:26] <x5c30> definitely stronger with its own nonce, since it's public that's normal to be in the headers
[06:31:55] <FlorianBad> yeah, and if my headers are a fixed size of 32KB e.g. then there's plenty of room for it anyway

[16:11:55] <lopid> functions can see variables that already exist when they're called, yes. `my` creates a new variable in the current scope
[16:12:46] <vanessa> even for @_ ?
[16:13:13] <simcop2387> perlbot: tell vanessa about coping with scoping

[16:13:47] <simcop2387> those all cover it in more detail, @_ is implicitly new on each function call (though it's more complicated than that)

[16:15:25] <simcop2387> perl has global scopes (our @variable) and block scoping (my @variable).  and dynamic scoping (local @variable) which is a bit more complicated and generally you won't worry about

[21:21:00] <LeoNerd> I have a list, and I want to pass that list into an object constructor which is expecting to receive name/value pairs. Currently my best attempt involves the List::Util::mesh function:  ClassName->new( mesh [qw( the key names go here )], [ @values ] )
[21:21:08] <LeoNerd> Can anyone think of anything else?
[21:21:43] <LeoNerd> I'm -almost- considering making this into a new function called `enkey`, to take an arrayref of key names, and the values from the rest of the argument list. So a sortof asymmetric version of mesh
[21:21:58] <LeoNerd> and would also complain about mismatch of length, rather than its current behaviour of filling in undefs
[21:25:15] <LeoNerd> Or I suppose I just give up and store the list in a temporary array of a short name like  my @v = ...  so I can do  the => $v[0], key => $v[1], names => $v[2], ...

[23:37:06] <gad4> hope it sent
[23:39:27] <gad4> did it send?
[23:41:21] <LeoNerd> You'll have to paste the URL in here

[23:42:31] <gad4> how do i get the link
[23:43:47] <gad4> the only output im seeing is..
[23:43:51] <gad4> ERROR: Experimental pop on scalar is now forbidden at (IRC) line 81, near "$rowd;"
[23:44:11] <buu> you monster
[23:44:20] <buu> Stop experimenting on scalars
[23:44:33] <buu> gad4: copy the url in the location bar
[23:44:54] <gad4> https://l.perl.bot/p/iih69k

[23:45:07] <buu> hurray
[23:45:26] <gad4> lol thanks 
[23:46:06] <buu> deparse: my $l1 = <$fh>, my $l2 = <$gh>
[23:46:08] <perlbot> buu: Use of uninitialized value $fh in <HANDLE> at (IRC) line 1. readline() on unopened filehandle at (IRC) line 1. Use of uninitialized value $gh in <HANDLE> at (IRC) line 1. readline() on unopened filehandle at (IRC) line 1. 
[23:46:14] <buu> whine whine whine
[23:46:43] <buu> gad4: indenting your code would help us read it
[23:47:10] <buu> gad4: What is this code meant to do "pop $rowd;
[23:47:13] <gad4> sorry. was writing in notepad 
[23:48:14] <gad4> if rowd begins with ÷ then it will remove it
[23:53:00] <buu> gad4: ok, pop is a function that works on arrays
[23:53:12] <buu> gad4: If you want to modify a string, I suggest s/// or substr
[23:53:53] <gad4> hand
[23:53:58] <gad4> thanks 
[23:54:38] <gad4> the match appears not to be working also

[23:55:06] <gad4> or is it?
[23:55:28] <buu> gad4: Also note that m/÷/ will match ÷ *anywhere* in the string, not just at the front
[23:56:34] <gad4> yes that's fine only place is in the document is front but if i put÷ compared to abc it gives different error messages 
[23:56:42] <buu> what kind of errors?
[23:56:57] <buu> gad4: It would be easier for all of us if you reduced the lines of code to something simpler we could all run, ideally run inside the paste site
[23:56:58] <gad4> the first never enters the loop. 
[23:57:37] <buu> gad4: what is $maxrows then?
[23:57:46] <gad4> the second(abc) not an array reference and stops
[23:58:25] <gad4> maxrows is number of array entry (defined a couple rows above)
[23:58:46] <buu> I meant the value when you ran it
[23:59:09] <buu> Please paste the exact "not an array reference" error
[23:59:36] <gad4> idk. the array which maxrows is related appear to work.
