[00:01:15] <Demosthenex> that's the agenda from that file.
[00:01:41] <Demosthenex> C-c a 1 a (open agenda restricted to this file), then L to enable logbook, and ] to show inactive
[00:01:46] <Demosthenex> oh, then i save it as html ;]
[00:01:58] <Demosthenex> then you can scroll thru the agenda, and even hit enter to jump to the item on the cursor
[00:02:06] <Demosthenex> write in org, explore your timeline in agenda
[00:03:17] <aidalgol> Demosthenex: Any particular reason you used two separate sites just then?
[00:03:35] <Demosthenex> aidalgol: uh. the html is a whole file, not just text. 
[00:03:41] <Demosthenex> wonder if dpaste could paste html
[00:04:18] <Demosthenex> https://dpaste.org/qMNo
[00:04:25] <Demosthenex> yeah, but even view raw didn't actuall *view* the html
[00:04:55] <aidalgol> So, the only problem with this method is that agenda seems designed around having agenda files configured ahead of time.  How would I keep separate agenda files for separate views (for my separate projects)?
[00:05:07] <acdw> oh i didn't know yo could view inactive timestamps , that's nice
[00:05:13] <Demosthenex> aidalgol: here's an example from my work of a complex document full of tasks all over the tree, exported in agenda http://demosthenes.org/tmp/SampleAgendaOutput.html

[00:05:28] <Demosthenex> aidalgol: NO. the default agenda view is configured. you can view agenda on any file at any time
[00:05:31] <Demosthenex> C-c a 1
[00:05:37] <Demosthenex> the 1 means only this current file
[00:05:42] <aidalgol> ah
[00:05:43] <aidalgol> cool!
[00:05:58] <acdw> nice
[00:06:01] <Demosthenex> its amazing, i explain this often, seems like it doesn't take
[00:06:04] <acdw> i need to make my agenda fancier
[00:06:14] <Demosthenex> i actually invoice my time from my agenda export
[00:06:24] <Demosthenex> and when fussy PM's get the bill and want proof, i send them my agenda output
[00:08:00] <Demosthenex> or maybe i should make a video explaining how this works.

[00:22:28] <Demosthenex> with spatial groups, i just arrow around all my huge virtual screen space
[00:23:11] <acdw> ooh looks nice
[00:23:37] <acdw> care to share your config? getting from the default C-t ... to an actual useable thing is .. dautning

[00:28:23] <Demosthenex> acdw: install stump, make sure it launches and C-t stuff works.
[00:28:34] <Demosthenex> then the readme has 3 lines for spatial
[00:28:46] <Demosthenex> and one line you can change the prefix key

[00:34:28] <Demosthenex> it wasn't a tiling WM, just a regular one. but i scriped setting up tiled terminals for myself
[00:34:47] <Demosthenex> and they had the right setup. multiple virtual desktops, with each virtual desktop made up of a grid of virtual screens.
[00:34:51] <Demosthenex> so you could pan around

[00:37:48] <Demosthenex> the key is to use keyboard for window focus selection and not alt-tab nonsense. then you step up to navigating virtual screens, then step up to virtual desktops.

[00:45:05] <acdw> hm weird
[00:45:33] <acdw> i do like using alt-tab for like, flipping between last-used windows, or maybe rotating through a "frame"  (in say, herbstluftwm's parlance)
[00:46:20] <Demosthenex> acdw: alt-tab is relative navigation. you have a stack of cards, you take the last and put it to bottom, but the card order is random and  you can only go forward and back
[00:46:24] *** Joins: euler123x (~user@189.216.188.72)
[00:46:49] <Demosthenex> acdw: spatial (in stump) is absolute navigation. you always know where you are, and you can navigate directly to where you want to go by muscle memory
[00:47:12] <acdw> exactly! I like doing the cards thing when i'm switching between the top two cards -- that's easier
[00:47:15] <acdw> but that's like, it
[00:47:38] <Demosthenex> if you read the readme, the idea is to make one desktop per major task. then surround that task with other subitems. then swap desktops.
[00:47:45] <acdw> i've been thinking i really want a workflow like, [][] <- these two "stacks" (no master or anything)
[00:47:52] <acdw> Demosthenex ooohhhhhhh
[00:47:52] <Demosthenex> right now, instead of alt tab between my email/irc and virtualbox, i swap desktops instantly
