[00:01:44] <Alipha> how is entropy calculated with a biased rng anyway? like for a simple example of 0 occurring 25% of the time and 1 occurring 75% of the time
[00:02:33] <maroon> yeah, i was about to ask, whether entropy was different for red|red|red|blue|green or red|red|blue|blue|green
[00:10:02] <onelegend> the hardware RNGs in the CPU are extremely sketchy
[00:10:30] <onelegend> I got a lava lamp, and want to try the same thing the cloudflare does
[00:16:32] <euouae> Alipha the formula is - sum p_j log_2(p_j) where p_j are the probabilities of the events
[00:16:50] <euouae> so for a biased die, you have p_1 to p_6 
[00:17:29] <euouae> in the paste example there's 16 digits, each independent of another, and the probabilities are 25/251 and 26/251, depending on whether you're looking at 1-9 or 0
[00:17:52] <euouae> (entropy adds for independent experiments)

[00:20:00] <maroon> euouae, what does your calculation show for a length 2 string intead of 16?
[00:21:14] <maroon> i tried a brute force test against the values 0-65535, and i got 62500 different outputs, which should be 16*log(62500)/log(65536) = 15.93156 ?
[00:32:21] <maroon> euouae, another question to cnsider, is that this outputs a 16-dit base-10 float, while 2^53 as a base 10 integer is 16 digits, but begins with 900, so for the 10% of outcomes which begin 901-999, is that float being output as scientific notation that's not distinguishable from each other? that would also kill the entropy

[00:38:15] <euouae> Alipha so in your simple example it would be -1/4 * log(1/4) - 3/4 * log(3/4)
[00:38:18] <euouae> Alipha so in your simple example it would be -1/4 * log(1/4) - 3/4 * log(3/4)
[00:38:37] <euouae> maroon I think the final conversion to float doesn't matter, it could just return 'o' just as well 
[00:39:11] <euouae> It's a 16 character string, each character is '0' to '9' and the probabilities are 26/251 for '0' and 25/251 after '0'
[00:39:37] <euouae> unless two different o variables can result in the same float value, but I don't think so
[00:41:08] <maroon> is it using 'floats' or 'string representation of float'?
[00:42:15] <maroon> is your formula for a 16-bit float coming up with 15.93156 entropy?
[00:43:40] <euouae> 16 bit float?
[00:44:50] <euouae> The values are 0.0...0 up to 0.9...9, I don't know what the size of the float is, but again I don't know if that matters

[00:47:54] <maroon> float can represent as an integer only if the 1.0 + number is <= 9007199254740991 right?
[00:50:00] <euouae> I don't know, but the return value is between 0 and 1 and also like I said I don't believe float overflow is the issue here 
[00:50:24] <euouae> I think you're talking about C floats on x86, I don't know what happens with javascript, I think this is javascript

[00:51:07] <jtgd> a 32bit float only has 24 bits of mantissa and so can only count to 2^24. After that it will skip numbers
[00:52:37] <euouae> hm... so not all values of delta 1e-16 can be represented? OK... maroon maybe you are right and also that issue has to be accounted for!
[00:53:12] <euouae> There was no indication in the textbook that the entropy issue was related to floats. :/
[00:53:38] <maroon> it may not be, im just asking
[00:54:41] <maroon> but im assuming your entropy is calculated based on (actual possible outcomes/ 2^53) ?
[00:58:11] <maroon> ok i see its not returing a 16 digit integer, it's 0.sixteendigits

[14:36:32] <furrykef> I'm writing a cyberpunk murder mystery and I have an idea that I want to make sure makes sense.
[14:38:36] <furrykef> The villain has an encrypted document. It's decrypted by using a key that is XORed with the document, like a one-time pad. So the hero does this and finds something especially damning and thinks he's got the villain.
[14:39:44] <furrykef> The villain's lawyer points out, however, that while the ciphertext's authenticity has been verified, the key's has not been: it might be a fake key.
[14:40:11] <furrykef> Because using this method you can make up a key to "decrypt" the document to say anything you want, right?
[14:40:44] <furrykef> However!
[14:42:02] <furrykef> The villain slipped up and used this key again for a second document (whose authenticity has also been verified). Because the same key decrypts *two* documents, it's far more likely to be a real key.

[14:42:52] <furrykef> Does this sound right to you guys? Would it be impossible (or at least impractical) to make one fake key that decrypts two different documents?
[14:43:17] <int-e> You need to authenticate the ciphertexts too.
[14:43:48] <furrykef> What do you mean?
[14:43:58] <int-e> I mean basically in this scenario the key in question is known (since you have a plaintext and a corresponding ciphertext from the accidental reuse)
[14:44:11] <int-e> and with the key and a desired plaintext I can construct a corresponding ciphertext
[14:44:48] <furrykef> Right. I'm saying it is known that the villain did possess both ciphertexts

[14:46:15] <furrykef> The key is the only item whose authenticity is in doubt
[14:46:52] <int-e> Well the known plaintext/ciphertext pair (which apparently is authentic) authenticates the key (since it can be derived from those two)
[14:47:56] <int-e> so yes, if you screw up that badly then those 3 bits (plaintext+ciphertext pair plus authentic second ciphertext) together that would authenticate the other plaintext.
[14:48:32] <furrykef> Oh, erm, correction: the key and the plaintext's authenticity are both initially in doubt
[14:48:37] <int-e> . o O ( Don't use one-time pads. )
[14:49:13] <furrykef> Yes, I'm taking a bit of creative license here by using an encryption method that I don't think is likely to be used in the real world
[14:49:46] <furrykef> But I think it still matters that it *could* be used in the real world
[14:50:54] <int-e> It may actually be used for highly sensitive diplomatic communications. But that's a very special scenario that involves diplomats carrying keys on physical media (and tamper-evident). And I have no clue whether it's actually done these days.
[14:51:02] <furrykef> I think it helps a bit that people make bad security decisions in real life, too, heh
[14:52:38] <int-e> For most purposes it's just too easy to screw up with OTPs, and the key size is just a tremendous problem. And standard symmetric crypto is deemed very secure and is superior in all those practical aspects.
[14:52:41] <furrykef> But remember this is a cyberpunk story. Coolness trumps realism. I think this idea can be pretty cool, if I can somehow make sure the audience understands it.
[14:53:08] <furrykef> (That may be a big 'if'.)
[14:54:20] <deadk> well, standard symmetric crypto is easy to screw up too :)
[14:54:33] <int-e> Sure, I suppose it can work as a plot device. We've had worse (computers breaking, what, 1024 bit encryption? (Password Swordfish))
[14:54:59] <int-e> deadk: Of course.
[14:55:44] <int-e> deadk: My thinking is that everything you can mess up with standard symmetric crypto you can also mess up with an OTP. Except maybe for phishing keys.
[14:56:31] <int-e> And OTP then adds multiple failure modes on top.
[14:56:53] *** Quits: vernaz (~vernaz@148.63.127.167) (Remote host closed the connection)
[15:01:09] <deadk> OTP's big problem is that reusing pad is game-ending, while reusing material with CBC or something is merely very bad. but you could make the argument that block cipher modes with that advantage are the outlier; stream ciphers and CTR don't have it
[15:04:56] <int-e> Hmm there's XTS which should be similar to CBC if you happen to reuse a nonce?
[15:06:14] <int-e> (what I call "nonce" is the block index in the disk encryption application)
[15:07:06] <furrykef> I'm thinking maybe the villain is one of those types of people who thinks he's much smarter than he really is, so he made this mistake because he trusted himself much more than actual security experts
[15:07:22] *** Joins: CryptoDavid (uid14990@id-14990.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[15:07:37] <furrykef> So he didn't realize you're not supposed to reuse the key
[15:08:07] <furrykef> And he did intend to use "fake key" as a defense but didn't realize it doesn't work if the key decrypts multiple documents.
[15:10:05] <int-e> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venona_project is a real-life story of OTP misuse
[15:10:41] <furrykef> Thanks, that may be useful.
[15:12:53] <deadk> int-e: possibly more like ctr? i think you could also make the case that OTP is easier to do correctly, or at least easier to know you've done correctly -- it's logistically problematic to do it at all, but possible to do in such a way that you can be very sure you didn't screw up
