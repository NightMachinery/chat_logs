[04:30:59] <Thilastiko> I'm trying to think up stuff t odo wit hmy litle arduino
[04:31:10] <hovercat> arduino uno?
[04:31:15] <Thilastiko> yeah
[04:31:21] <Thilastiko> I have a little kit
[04:31:30] <Thilastiko> but I dont want to use the IDE it comes with
[04:31:45] <Thilastiko> but I dont know how it is linking its little libraries
[04:31:51] <hovercat> I have one. ALl I ever really did with it was mount a webcam to a servo and had it pan back and forth 180 degrees at the entrance to the old apartment.
[04:31:53] <Thilastiko> I dont want to screw it up
[04:32:14] <hovercat> Doesn't it have it's own little code? Or something else?
[04:32:27] <hovercat> been so long
[04:32:29] <Thilastiko> I think making an actual hovercraft for a cat would be a cool arduino project
[04:32:59] <hovercat> yeah but then you are getting into motor controls, the mechanical overhead grows steeply
[04:33:17] <hovercat> but it would be cool
[04:33:29] <hovercat> Then I wouldn't have to work so hard at hovering
[04:33:33] <Thilastiko> the little arduino scripts are really just C++, but they have some extra make script somwhere that puts the executable into the right format.. I dunno
[04:33:57] <Thilastiko> but I am really just into sensors...
[04:34:18] <hovercat> yeah I have a rasbpi kit with all them fancy sensors.
[04:34:23] <Thilastiko> I wanna make a little stereoscopic camera setup for photogrammetry
[04:34:33] <hovercat> So many tutorials and python is much easier for a dummy like me to manipulate
[04:34:40] <Thilastiko> can rasberry pi do analog input?
[04:34:50] <hovercat> ??
[04:35:09] <hovercat> it has pwm and 5V outs
[04:35:23] *** Quits: arcturus (~arcturus@gateway/tor-sasl/arcturus) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:35:26] <hovercat> yeah it can poll devices.
[04:35:42] <Thilastiko> it would be cool to have my own little irc-didicated rasberry pi

[04:36:05] <Thilastiko> what captures the interest of the hover cat then?

[04:36:51] <hovercat> you don't have to dwell in dark places to have internet privacy
[04:36:56] <Thilastiko> I only use programs written before 1998
[04:37:04] <Thilastiko> and that are free anyway
[04:37:13] <hovercat> I have DOS 6.2 diskettes somewhere....
[04:37:21] <hovercat> Tor is free.
[04:37:49] <hovercat> but anyhow yeah I've noticed you use an emacs irc client so I assumed you are a bit old school. Ofc I could totally be off base.
[04:38:08] <Thilastiko> I was into emacs before it was cool
[04:38:19] <hovercat> but was it ever cool?
[04:38:28] <Thilastiko> emacs and spice girls, my two great loves

[05:05:21] <Thilastiko> its a marxist miracle
[05:05:26] <hovercat> Imho I feel change is coming for the world.
[05:05:40] <Thilastiko> change is good
[05:05:44] <hovercat> People want certain undeniable freedoms, even if they are lies and fallacy of perception.
[05:06:06] <Thilastiko> its not a lie if you believe it
[05:06:12] <hovercat> It took time for it to manifest, but it has happened in some occasions.
[05:06:22] <Thilastiko> what has?
[05:06:34] <hovercat> People wanting to be free from opressive government.
[05:06:34] <Panther> Why do people give to beggars, he was asked, but not to philosophers? "Because they think they may one day be lame or blind, but never expect that they will turn to philosophy."
[05:07:14] <Thilastiko> no one ever says "I want to be a philosopher when I grow up"
[05:07:18] <hovercat> I think government is healthy, for society, when not abused.
[05:07:31] <Thilastiko> governemt is just a vehicle

[05:09:06] <Thilastiko> yeah bro!
[05:09:11] <hovercat> The division keeps them conquered, ignorant, at war.

[18:33:21] <Delf> hovercat: In order for humanity to prosper, it must learn the importance of communication. This is how we evolve, together.
[18:34:10] <arcturus> rather, its about no holds barred competition

[18:38:42] <brigand> i can prevent you from MAKING insults by /ignoring you. just saying how irc works
[18:46:18] <Delf> Suppose you /ignore Delf, would that prevent me from MAKiNG insults?
[18:48:16] <brigand> yes
[18:48:22] <Delf> Alright. It is not hard to insult people and it's even easier to admit insulting people.

[18:52:13] <Delf> Ahh. You got me wondering if and why you dislike me :)
[18:53:43] <Delf> Anyways... I got to go afk for a little while. Consider not fucking at each other. We're stronger together.

[20:05:52] <amigojapan> brigand: "In moral philosophy, deontological ethics or deontology (from Greek: δέον, 'obligation, duty' + λόγος, 'study') is the normative ethical theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules, rather than based on the" I don't think I mean by any rules, just having the hunch you are doing the right thing should be enough to justify

[20:08:16] <spruit11> there's also religious,  utilitarian,  and more.
[20:08:31] <brigand> some sites say utilitarianism *is* consequentialism

According to the principle of double effect, sometimes it is permissible to cause a harm as a side effect (or “double effect”) of bringing about a good result even tho

[22:28:49] <biys> econo: as much as it is moral nihilism it isn't necessarily asssociated with morals.  it's more-so that any action or phenom or idea isn't good or bad.  there is no ethical or moral ideas associated with the ideas inherently.
[22:29:03] *** Quits: gladiolu1 (~egoist@107.191.99.49) (Quit: gladiolu1)
[22:30:36] <biys> there are no preconceived notions associated with a matter of anything being in any sense "good" or "bad"...  as far as you'd have to go to define good and bad within themselves
[22:30:45] <biys> less desireable/more desireable?
[22:31:09] <biys> less necessary more necessary?
[22:32:20] <biys> we can take the same harris approach an suggest that it's like... harm
[22:32:22] <biys> and a matter of harm reduction
[22:32:49] <biys> but the conversation breaks down once we start trying to talk about why harm is bad and how it's necessary.
[22:33:30] <econo> is your claim then that morality is poorly defined?
[22:33:51] <biys> take the JBP argument on the conversation with his jaque panksep data review... perhaps there's some kind of biological function
[22:34:10] <biys> "rat tickler"
[22:35:00] <biys> i like to view it as a matter of constantly changing as we progress through time and space
[22:35:20] <biys> what was a bad genocide today could end up actually being a good genocide as we progressin time and space.
[22:35:29] <biys> lets say an example of an invacive species in a geographic area
[22:35:36] <biys> invasive ?
[22:35:52] <biys> invasive
[22:36:22] <biys> so i like to think of it as net gain and net loss
[22:37:26] <biys> it was a loss for the species that was genocided but it was a gain for the ecosystem that was under attack by it
[22:37:36] <econo> so you don't deny that morality exists then, just that it is unknowable unless you're an ideal observer?
[22:37:44] <biys> as we progress we find out that ecosystem is responsible for curing *
[22:37:54] <biys> so the genocide actually ends up being a good thing
[22:37:58] <biys> if the end resut was to cure *
[22:38:42] <biys> it's obvious that they exist.  seems people have this idea of rightand wrong in their minds.  i've never been able to really narrow down how people come to the determination within themselves completely and entirely though
[22:38:55] <biys> is it divine?  is it biological?
[22:39:45] <biys> but to say the idea of morals don't exist is nonsense
[22:40:12] <econo> well, when you claim moral nihilism that is what most people will assume you mean
[22:40:18] <biys> i'm about to make the case that criminals arne't criminals hey're just victims of their intersectionality
[22:40:21] <biys> "victim" is used loosely

[22:40:32] <biys> they are just a _result_ of their intersectionality
[22:41:01] <econo> can't we know, probabilistically at least, the moral outcomes of our actions?
[22:41:15] <biys> as we progress through time and space?  or in a singular instance?
[22:41:17] <econo> a good deed done to day is more likely than not to be a good deed tomorrow
[22:41:47] <econo> if i save a baby it's possible that baby grows up to be hitler and i have made a grave mistake
[22:41:56] <biys> haha.  would you kill baby hitler?
[22:41:57] <biys> jk jk
[22:42:07] <econo> but the expected morality of saving the baby is positive
[22:42:11] <biys> but yes... to some extent
[22:42:33] <biys> i'd say that there's even significant underpinning associated with the ideas that babies ought to be saved
[22:42:39] <biys> or anything, for that matter, has any ``right to life''
[22:42:54] <biys> i guess for the babies sake you could say it is a "good thing"
[22:42:56] <biys> maybe their parents
[22:43:12] *** Joins: Brainium (~brainium@user/brainium)
[22:43:30] <biys> but me, sitting where i am right now, it doesn't matter if the baby lived or died
[22:43:36] <biys> it could some day though
[22:43:39] <biys> maybe
[22:43:47] <biys> if the stars align just right and the wind speed is optimal
[22:44:31] <biys> if i am unaware of the baby in the first place and you saved it i don't see how it even matters
[22:44:42] <biys> unless that baby could have ended up being baby jesus
[22:44:46] <biys> hyperbolic
[22:45:26] <econo> it matters on the margin at least right? Even specifically to you. Kill enough babies and it's probably a net negative for you
[22:45:41] <econo> to say nothing of morality in a larger context as it effects society

[22:54:35] <biys> there is no moral facts i believe that could transcend space and time
[22:54:57] <biys> i could think up scenarios for everything on either side of the scale
[22:55:38] <econo> could an ideal observer, someone who was omniscient, state moral facts in your theory?
[22:56:53] <biys> if they themselves transcend space and time i assume they could to some extent or another
[22:57:12] <biys> they'd be able to speak to net negatives or net positives.
[22:57:25] <biys> "if that person had been allowed to live cancer would have been cured 50 years sooner"
[22:57:32] <econo> how much certainty is necessary? 100% certainty?
[22:57:32] <biys> provided that is an admirable outcome
[22:57:56] <biys> without certainty you're not really speaking to the true "moral" implications of the scenario
[22:58:15] <biys> certainty as it transcends space and time
[22:58:40] <biys> certain action happens, it's considered bad, as time progresses it's actually good.  using those terms loosely
[22:58:52] <econo> why can't we treat morality probabilistically?
[22:59:52] <biys> i don't think we necessarily can't...  we'd have to be open to the fact that it is just probability though
[23:00:30] <biys> i just think of the line of text "it isn't outside the realm of possibilities"
[23:00:43] <biys> it is probably okay to go outside your house most of the time but sometimes you die
[23:00:52] <biys> :s/you/people/
[23:01:48] <biys> the problem as i see it though would be based on details surrounding the scenario
[23:02:09] <biys> how you'd go about measuring the probability would be near impossible as the scenarios are ephemeral
