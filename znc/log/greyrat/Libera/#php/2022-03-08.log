[00:53:14] <da_wunder> hmm, compiled containers are a lot faster than containers that are build in with every request...
[00:57:00] <TML> I'm assuming they're claiming this is some kind of I/O barrier?
[00:58:24] <TML> time dd if=/dev/zero of=test.dat bs=1024 count=100000  -- time inside docker mounted volume: 1.530s; time in parent MacOS (in the same directory): 1.534s
[00:58:37] <TML> doesn't appear to be anywhere near "60 times slower" for me
[00:58:47] <TML> I'm really curious how they measured that
[01:01:38] <AllenJB> Docker for Windows on an aging laptop with eco class spinny disk vs bare metal on a high spec server with SSD SAN   =P
[01:01:57] <Sammitch> where was that wild-ass claim made?
[01:02:11] <TML>  da_wunder | this is one tool that you could use with windows and mac - http://docker-sync.io/
[01:04:38] <TML> da_wunder: I just cannot reproduce your claims that "mac with docker has serious IO problems" - we have 150+ developers working daily in Docker images on MacOS and have zero reports of even mild "IO problems", let alone "serious" ones. Can you craft a Dockerfile that reproduces your "serious IO problems" and share it?
[01:05:18] <TML> I'm not sure what you mean by "containers that are build in with every request"
[01:05:31] <TML> Are you saying that you build a new Docker container for every single HTTP request?
[01:05:46] <TML> If that's what you're doing, I think I know why you think Docker has "serious IO problems"
[01:06:38] <da_wunder> TML: eg. try to use frameworks that uses built containers like Symfony and run that PHP process inside that docker container - and not in your host machince
[01:07:04] <Sammitch> even spinning up a fresh container per-request would be a powerfully bad idea
[01:07:15] <Sammitch> *from an existing image
[01:09:09] <da_wunder> and with that I mean that you map your host machine directory inside that docker container - so you're editing files in your host machine and just syncing those to docker image - and inside your docker image you're rebuilding cache in each request
[01:09:10] <TML> da_wunder: Well, all of our sites are run using the PHP process inside a docker container, whether in a production kubernetes stack or local development on an individual's Macbook. We're not seeing any IO problems.
[01:09:46] <TML> da_wunder: What do you mean "syncing [files] to docker image"? You don't use docker volumes?
[01:09:49] <da_wunder> TML: so you're running your dev environment on host machine - not inside docker...
[01:10:09] <TML> da_wunder: No, the dev environment runs inside Docker
[01:10:25] <TML> "all of our sites are run using the PHP process inside a docker container, whether in a production kubernetes stack or local development on an individual's Macbook"
[01:11:04] <Sammitch> so your issue is that when you start a new container it doesn't have a pre-built cache? there are ways around that
[01:11:25] <Sammitch> eg: move the cache outside the container, mount a volume for the cache, or pre-build the cache in the image itself
[01:11:57] <da_wunder> Sammitch: prebuilt cache is not the solution - because we're running _dev_ environment in that... so cache is not used at all...
[01:12:14] <Sammitch> well then I'm back to not even knowing what your complaint is
[01:13:06] <da_wunder> just that running docker based dev environment is on linux machine just ~50ms request and with macos it's like ~10s
[01:13:39] <Albright> Is the Mac using an M1?
[01:14:19] <da_wunder> M1 is a bit faster (6-7s)  but still no match
[01:14:54] <da_wunder> just because mac/windows has a terrible IO speed with docker
[01:14:56] <Sammitch> M1's speed is not the issue, it's that it's a totally different arch, and you might be emulating x86_64, and that might be the problem right there
[01:14:58] <Albright> Ha, I was going to say the M1 might actually be slower if it's having to emulate an x86-64 OS inside the environment
[01:15:04] <Sammitch> jinx
[01:15:08] <TML> da_wunder: How are you measuring this?
[01:15:10] <Albright> jinx - ah damn

[01:16:47] <TML> da_wunder: I don't know what that means. What tools are you using to measure? What are the requests you're performing? What does your Dockerfile look like? How are you mounting your docker volume?

[01:20:01] <TML> are you doing something stupid like running docker inside docker?
[01:20:26] <TML> so you have your Docker Machine -> dockerd -> dockerd -> container?
[01:20:40] <Albright> yo dawg I heard you like containers
[01:20:49] <da_wunder> Sammitch: I just asked mac users to try some repository out - and we did exactly same commands (after each of us prune all docker things first) and PC (with) won that race with milestone - and after that we tryied response times of that application and once again PC (with linux) won with milestone

[01:22:37] <da_wunder> TML: and I'm using Windows host, where I run VirtualBox Ubuntu, and in that vm ubuntu I run my docker - and it's still faster that running docker images directly inside windows / mac - specially if/when those images are IO heavy

[01:23:43] <TML> Never touch the stuff, personally

[01:24:09] <TML> da_wunder: Give me this example you had your "mac users" try out
[01:24:25] <Sammitch> M1 is a different CPU architecture and instruction set.
[01:24:26] <da_wunder> TML: the point is that there isn't any problems with windows + virtualbox combo...
[01:24:29] <TML> I'll bet your MacOS users were just doing something ridiculous
[01:24:49] <Sammitch> unless you are building images _specifically_ for M1 macs to run, it's under emulation.
[01:24:50] <TML> da_wunder: ok - I cannot speak to that, as I don't use Windows
[01:25:51] <da_wunder> TML: I don't think so - most of them have used mac +5-10years - but if something like that is so hard with mac - I really don't understand why people are even using that...

[06:48:20] <__adrian> or dig into the code
[06:48:50] <__adrian> if you just mean that the $variable you're trying to use is null... then you should be checking first
[06:49:36] <Dr-007> __adrian yeah i could check if its null further up the line
[06:49:45] <__adrian> s/could/should/
[06:49:50] <Dr-007> but its 'nicer' if its caught before hand
[06:49:55] <__adrian> no
[06:49:57] <Dr-007> im reading this now: https://tighten.com/blog/extending-models-in-eloquent/
[06:50:09] <__adrian> it's nicer if your code knows what its varibales are
[06:50:10] <Dr-007> no? yes! :)
[06:50:46] <__adrian> 1) get your $model  2) if your $model is null, then something's wrong  3) otherwise, continue

[06:52:47] <Dr-007> the model isnt null, a field inthere sometimes is null. its a basic function of this framework the $casts
[06:52:58] <Dr-007> i thought it was pretty sweet
[06:53:14] <Dr-007> but when its null its 'wrong'
[06:53:19] <__adrian> i don't know what you mean by "$casts"
[06:53:37] <Dr-007> ill make a paste if yu're intereseted
[06:53:45] <__adrian> are you talking about casting? some cast() method? an actual variable $cast ?
[06:54:00] <__adrian> if that last one, what's the variable contain?
[06:56:48] <Dr-007> this is my model: https://dpaste.com/GA3LKVMST
[06:57:05] <Dr-007> on line 20 there's $casts
[06:57:16] <Dr-007> they transform json database fields to arrays
[06:57:26] <__adrian> that's just an array
[06:57:43] <Dr-007> ..
[06:57:44] <__adrian> so i'm assuming there's some other code that looks at that mapping and uses it to cast values
[06:57:49] <Dr-007> yes
[06:57:52] <Dr-007> exactly
[06:57:57] <__adrian> that code is broken.
[06:58:24] <Dr-007> no no no.. the url is send first explains how to alter it https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/eloquent/eloquent-casts-array-returns-null-instead-of-empty-array
[06:58:28] <__adrian> or maybe it has rules (e.g., "things can't be null"), and your code breaks those rules
[06:58:38] <Dr-007> i only dont understand where to put it
[06:58:45] <Dr-007> but ill google some more
[06:59:02] <Dr-007> because i dont want to mix it up with 'their' code
[06:59:13] <Dr-007> it has to be in my repository
[06:59:28] <__adrian> there's a link to the method source in that discussion you linked
[06:59:57] <__adrian> along with a working example of the solution
[07:00:35] <__adrian> i'd wonder why you're casting all these objects to array
[07:00:52] <Dr-007> this link you mean? https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/8c90fcea68393caca6f4b5bc41c7cd83f3dc68ce/src/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Concerns/HasAttributes.php
[07:01:04] <__adrian> no

[07:01:31] <__adrian> oh, right.
[07:01:32] <__adrian> misread.
[07:01:35] <Dr-007> i dont want to modify it
[07:01:46] <__adrian> no one suggested you modify it
[07:01:56] <Dr-007> because when someone would do a composer install then my changes wouldnt be there
[07:02:00] <Dr-007> ok
[07:02:06] <__adrian> reading it will help you understand what's happening (why the method doesn't do what you want)
[07:02:31] <Dr-007> yes, i understand that part ;)
[07:02:39] <Dr-007> thats why i want to extend their class
[07:02:48] <Dr-007> and modify it like ... (pasting)
[07:03:01] <__adrian> that's the "best answer" in the same thread you linked

[07:03:38] <Dr-007> https://dpaste.com/D7B9K7FSZ
[07:03:50] <Dr-007> nothing, i just dont get where to put it
[07:03:58] <Dr-007> thats what im trying to figure out
[07:03:58] <Dr-007> hehe
[07:04:11] <__adrian> exactly where you just put it in your paste
[07:04:15] <__adrian> in your Model class
[07:04:23] <Dr-007> aaah
[07:04:51] <Dr-007> that's probably it
[07:05:09] <Dr-007> i figured there would be some kind of preprocessor place / path
[07:05:13] <Dr-007> im going to try
[07:05:22] <__adrian> no, it's an actual working example
[07:05:57] <__adrian> i'd be more concerned, though, about why you have properties that are unexpectedly null. or why you're taking all those objects and turning them into arrays
[07:07:06] <Dr-007> works! https://dpaste.com/4YXLH4PRT
[07:07:52] <Dr-007> they arent unexpectedly null. i also googled to alter my migration php
[07:08:02] <Dr-007> for the database to set a default database value
[07:08:13] <Dr-007> but that wouldnt work on a database json field
[07:08:15] <__adrian> if it was expected, you wouldn't have a problem
[07:08:23] <__adrian> of course it would
[07:08:28] <__adrian> a JSON field can be nullable
[07:08:38] <Dr-007> yes it is nullable right now
[07:08:44] <Dr-007> but you cannot set a default value
[07:08:45] <__adrian> and if there's "no json" then null *would* be the proper default
[07:09:03] <__adrian> do you _have_ a default?
[07:09:11] <Dr-007> no, google said you cant
[07:09:11] <__adrian> i mean, a legitimate default value?
[07:09:13] <Dr-007> so i didnt even try
[07:09:49] <Dr-007> anyways, lets not make a big deal out of nothing im fairly sure this is the way to go
[07:09:54] <Dr-007> thanks for your input
[07:10:19] * __adrian shrugs
[07:10:35] <__adrian> pretty sure you're chasing a solution to a problem that shouldn't exist, but ok.
[07:12:00] *** Joins: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky)
[07:12:54] *** Quits: thiras (~thiras@user/thiras) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[07:13:17] <Dr-007> the problem wouldnt exist if laravel would add the NULL test in their base code. so i agree that it shouldnt exist.. but it exists.
[07:13:31] <Dr-007> the reason i want to do it this way is because i dont want redundant code
[07:13:43] <Dr-007> 'same' code to check if its null further down the line
[07:13:52] <Dr-007> i just want to foreach() my array
[07:14:05] <Dr-007> if its empty then foreach() wouldnt be filling anything anyways
[07:14:21] <Dr-007> i dont want to wrap it with if(is_null($arr)) { }
[07:14:33] <__adrian> so again, why are you casting these objects to array in the first place?
[07:15:06] <Dr-007> because its json
[07:15:17] <__adrian> objects are not json
[07:15:38] <Dr-007> in my database field 'genre' there's json stored.
[07:15:51] <Dr-007> so instead of making my own function json_encode($genre)
[07:15:58] <Dr-007> i use $casts to do it for me
[07:15:59] <Blondie101010> sure, a simple data set
[07:16:07] <Blondie101010> *data*
[07:16:43] <__adrian> these are not objects? is this a raw column value?
[07:17:02] <Dr-007> not object raw json in postgresql
[07:17:15] <Dr-007> (i meant json_decode before)
[07:17:59] <Dr-007> there's also a jsonb option in postgresql, perhabs then this wouldnt be an issue
[07:18:18] <Blondie101010> just decode it as an array
[07:18:34] <__adrian> it's null (the column is empty)
[07:18:46] <Dr-007> sometimes
[07:19:07] <__adrian> you should (a) not be operating directly on the value (b) skip it if it's null
[07:20:05] <__adrian> what data is stored in this column? "json and sometimes empty" sounds like it shouldn't be a column (and possibly not json)
[07:20:25] * Blondie101010 nods
[07:20:41] <Dr-007> well, thats true
[07:20:52] <Dr-007> i was pondering if i would make relational tables
[07:20:54] <Blondie101010> but as bad as it is, it's not uncommon at all :S
[07:20:59] <__adrian> if you did it that way, you wouldn't have this problem.
[07:21:03] <Dr-007> or just be lazy and import the genre fields as json
[07:21:17] <__adrian> lazy = nutso problems like this one
[07:21:18] <Dr-007> true
[07:21:32] <Dr-007> its a new feauture in postgresql and laravel
[07:21:37] <__adrian> eloquent handles relationships
[07:21:48] <Dr-007> before hand i googled if searching these json fields was doable in a query
[07:21:56] <Dr-007> so im kind of exploring
[07:21:59] <__adrian> sure
[07:22:09] <__adrian> i don't know the exact syntax in postgres
[07:22:29] <__adrian> but they support path selection like any other db with a json type does
[07:23:02] <Dr-007> but yes, there would be multiple fixes to my problem. i could also alter my import script to not use NULL. but this way is also pretty sweet
[07:23:09] <Dr-007> yeah
[07:23:15] <Dr-007> that's right
[07:23:23] <Dr-007> im new to postgresql
[07:23:42] <Dr-007> so im curious if its fast and stuff
[07:24:12] <Dr-007> but rest assured, if this was a site for a (big) company i wouldve used relational tables
[07:24:34] <__adrian> why would that help me rest?
[07:24:44] <Dr-007> lol
[07:25:04] <__adrian> doing things the right way is not complicated. why eschew it simply because you're not a "big site"?
[07:25:04] <Dr-007> i dont know! you seem very involved
[07:25:47] <__adrian> if you wrote the tables that way, a big chunk of the complicated code you're trying to figure out now would just go away. it's _less_ complicated.
[07:28:18] <__adrian> spend the time to learn from the proven designs and solutions that already exist
[07:32:24] <Dr-007> true, but sometimes you gotta try the new stuff. laravel is new to me. when i installed it i got a bunch of errors that mysql couldnt create their out-of-the-box json field. so i switched to postgresql to get it working. so i looked into it.. and well, now we're talking. if you get my drift
[07:32:55] <Dr-007> but again, thanks for your input. ill keep it in mind. i can always still go with relational tables
[07:33:17] <Dr-007> anyways, totally different subject. where are you from? the states?
[07:33:30] <Blondie101010> Dr-007:  is that JSON **ever** used outside JS?
[07:34:08] <Blondie101010> ie: is there any PHP condition based on it for example?
[07:35:45] <Dr-007> Blondie101010, nope. not really.
[07:35:56] <Dr-007> is there a postgresql 'array' type i didnt know about?
[07:39:08] <__adrian> when you think "array" in a DB you should be thinking "table"
[07:39:16] <__adrian> arrays don't belong in the db
[07:40:35] <Dr-007> hehe, i know guys
[07:40:38] <Dr-007> its new
[07:40:42] <Dr-007> im playing with it
[07:41:01] <Blondie101010> Dr-007: the only case I may tolerate json in a DB field is if it's only meant to be transfered as is
[07:41:05] <Dr-007> like i said, before hand i googled if these json fields are searchable. and google said yes
[07:41:15] <Dr-007> so it made me curious
[07:42:17] <Dr-007> but i think its kinda nice. now i get my $imdb model and the genre's are there in a sub array

[07:42:41] <Dr-007> to left join the bunch

[07:43:32] <__adrian> and many small, well-designed models beat out one giant one every day of the week.
[07:43:53] <Blondie101010> you're making everything slower and more complicated for nothing
[07:44:07] <Dr-007> ok
[07:44:07] <Blondie101010> design the DB better
[07:44:25] <Dr-007> you're really making me doubt myself, so ill probably change it in the long run
[07:44:43] <Blondie101010> that shouldn't be too hard to change
[07:45:21] <Dr-007> well.. right now my import looks like this: $imdb->genre = explode(',', $omdb['Genre']);
[07:45:25] <Dr-007> $imdb->save();
[07:45:32] <Dr-007> which is a one liner
[07:45:47] <__adrian> you don't have to doubt yourself  :p  just spend the time learning about ideas and then think about them
[07:45:58] <__adrian> "it's a one-liner" has zero value
[07:46:09] <__adrian> and it's often the worse solution because of it
[07:46:16] <Blondie101010> :)
[07:46:19] <Dr-007> hah, i worked briefly at a company where i was working on frontend
[07:46:24] <Dr-007> they used vuejs
[07:46:34] <Dr-007> an these guys put so much crap on one line
[07:46:36] <Blondie101010> and if you read csv, why not use csv functions?
[07:47:06] <__adrian> ^ does this CSV have a schema? or is it completely arbitrary?
[07:47:13] <Blondie101010> note that the csv there is similar to the json problem
[07:47:16] <Dr-007> Blondie101010, thats a good point. reason is that im still learning laravel and postgresql. so im trying it because the installation process made me notice
[07:47:19] <Blondie101010> what are you trying to do?
[07:47:48] <Dr-007> (made me notice the json error , that it was missing from mysql so i had to switch to postgresql, and then i wanted to try it out)
[07:47:58] <Blondie101010> oh well

[22:25:05] <judabuda> how to make so when i can visit login.php/help ?
[22:25:29] <judabuda> i have login.php and can access
[22:25:46] <judabuda> but how do i make so i can visit login.php/help page?
[22:26:42] <teresko> ounds like what you really need is looking up the term "url routing" and "url rewrite"
[22:27:26] <judabuda> i think so
[22:28:28] *** Joins: junktext_ (~junktext@gateway/vpn/pia/junktext)
[22:28:33] <da_wunder> would be a bit clearer if you just have _one_ entry point - and then you could have eg. `/login`, `/login/help` and so on
[22:29:23] <da_wunder> google eg. "php routing" and you should get multiple results
[22:30:39] <da_wunder> like - https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute

[23:05:46] <judabuda> anyone here familiar with php smarty?
[23:06:50] <TML> You don't need to do URL routing for that. You can just use $_SERVER['PATH_INFO']
[23:07:24] <TML> I am personally opposed to application-level URL routing in PHP. My httpd already does URL routing just fine. :D
[23:09:53] <judabuda> no, i have problem with php smarty, i can't set variable i set in config.php. index.tpl doesn't display $randomvalue = '123'; and when i add it to index.tpl <?php echo $randomvalue ?> it doens't display it
[23:10:36] <Albright> judabuda: The entire idea of templating systems like Smarty is that you *wouldn't* use PHP code in the template files.
[23:11:22] <__adrian> judabuda: that would be a question for a smarty channel/forum/etc. i'd also encourage you to read their docs and make sure you have error reporting properly enabled.
[23:11:48] <teresko> judabuda: what google queries have you tried?
[23:12:04] <Albright> What you probably are looking for is `{$randomvalue}`. Check this out. https://www.smarty.net/docs/en/language.basic.syntax.tpl
[23:12:17] <__adrian> https://www.smarty.net/  ← there's a "Resources" section there.

[23:15:00] <judabuda> Albright: im looking through their docs
[23:16:13] <judabuda> don't know if what i said was understandable, but im looking to include basic variable $whatever = '123'; and put $whatever in .tpl file, but it doesn't seem to read it
[23:16:50] <teresko> what google queries have you tried?
[23:16:53] <Albright> Yes, I understood that.
[23:17:05] <Albright> But you cannot use PHP in a .tpl file. That is the point.
[23:18:25] <da_wunder> judabuda: just read the docs - https://www.smarty.net/docs/en/language.variables.tpl#language.assigned.variables
[23:19:00] <judabuda> Albright: none at the moment
