[00:23:24] <estranger> they love their kafka! 
[00:23:29] <SpeakerToMeat> I can't risk trying my luck with getting 16/18/20 TB drives and them not working.

[00:25:21] <SpeakerToMeat> CableNinja, Not so easy an answer with HP
[00:25:55] <SpeakerToMeat> CableNinja, I need to trawl all bios updates (and see if I can download them without a contract), to see if any mentions anything about drive size, at all

[00:28:36] <CableNinja> SpeakerToMeat, bit out of my depth here. but I'd recommend you go in a direction that gives you a good buffer (~20%) for expansion in the future so you dont have to go through this again for a good while
[00:28:50] <bomb> cloud no more, we're diving right into transistors!
[00:29:38] <bomb> if I were you, I'd order bunch of server parts while still can.
[00:29:45] <SpeakerToMeat> CableNinja, I'm thinking the DAS is a nice option here
[00:29:59] <CableNinja> SpeakerToMeat, yeah. easily expandable
[00:31:07] <SpeakerToMeat> with a DAS and changing all internal drives to 8TB and the DAS ones to 8TB as well, I can reach the 20k thingies by populating only.... 6 of the DAS 12 slots. So I can expand more in the future (33% more)
[00:31:30] <CableNinja> '20k thingies'
[00:31:33] <CableNinja> wtf you talkin bout
[00:31:44] <SpeakerToMeat> The data that's stored on the server

[00:32:42] <bomb> did you just confess that you have access to 20k porn movies?
[00:32:52] <bomb> 20,000 porn movies damn
[00:32:54] <SpeakerToMeat> current capacity was toped at 4188 movies, I'm offering same server expansion to 10k, they want to future proof to 20k

[00:34:12] <SpeakerToMeat> Hmmm anybody has used Aventis systems? are they... trustworthy?
[00:34:22] <CableNinja> SpeakerToMeat, 8x12 is 96tb <raw>
[00:34:36] <CableNinja> you're not accounting for redundancy and lost disks, etc
[00:34:49] <CableNinja> so you're really only looking at half of that usable at best
[00:34:50] <SpeakerToMeat> CableNinja, on the DAS, on the server there's 9 drives, 8 active and 1 warm spare
[00:35:02] <SpeakerToMeat> In fact if I add the DAS I'll probably keep a second warm spare
[00:35:16] <SpeakerToMeat> With 8TB drives, I want rebuild to kick in as quickly as possible.
[00:35:20] *** Joins: rpifan (~rpifan@user/rpifan)
[00:35:43] <SpeakerToMeat> of the server's 12 drives, 3 are OS in raid 5, 8 are ZFS zraid2 plus one warm spare
[00:35:57] <CableNinja> raid5... groooooos
[00:36:22] <SpeakerToMeat> so with 2 warm spares, I have a total of 19 drives I can use for live data
[00:36:29] <CableNinja> so... you're not getting the full usable space with 8 zfs raid2
[00:36:46] <CableNinja> you're getting less than half I think?
[00:36:51] <csws> nah
[00:36:58] <csws> raidz2 is 2 parity disks
[00:37:00] <csws> so it's like raid 6
[00:37:06] <SpeakerToMeat> Correct
[00:37:45] <SpeakerToMeat> I've never liked X0 raids, because failure tolerance is not symmetrical so it's not always accurate
[00:37:50] <csws> why isn't the OS something like RAID 1?
[00:37:54] <CableNinja> ^
[00:38:07] <SpeakerToMeat> csws, yes, that's a good idea and I've considered it, as well.
[00:38:18] <CableNinja> also because you're using zfs resilver shouldnt take that long at all
[00:38:26] <CableNinja> with so few drives
[00:40:06] <SpeakerToMeat> But the larger the drive.
[00:40:30] <CableNinja> not so much, its more about data size
[00:40:59] <SpeakerToMeat> For example, if I drop OS to raid 1, and shove 9x12TB (supported by the Gen9), plus one warm spare, I can get 18k movies at least

[00:46:47] <csws> afraid of how superior RAID 10 is probably
[00:46:57] <SpeakerToMeat> Raid 10 boasts "2 drive" resiliency, but it's a lie, it can be a single drive failure resiliency if you're unlucky
[00:47:00] <A-KO> CableNinja: my 3rd SSD slot takes over like 2 SATA ports basically--so I'd lose 2 physical drives to use it. Not a big deal.
[00:47:07] <A-KO> I've got a 2TB SSD and a 1TB SSD
[00:47:08] <SpeakerToMeat> if both drives on the same side of the 10 die, you're toast. 
[00:47:28] <csws> yeah but what's teh chance of that..
[00:47:30] <A-KO> WD SN850 and a Samsung 970
[00:47:31] <CableNinja> A-KO, time for an eSATA :D
[00:47:35] <SpeakerToMeat> with raid6 it doesn't mater which two drives die
[00:47:36] <A-KO> I thought about that
[00:47:46] <csws> I had 6 drives "fail" in a 40 drive RAID 10 one time
[00:47:47] <A-KO> but I use storage spaces so each drive has to be individually addressable
[00:47:56] <CableNinja> oof
[00:47:57] <csws> it was because the enclosure hadn't fully warmed up before the OS started so it didn't see those drives
[00:47:59] <bomb> RAID0 is the fastest. so, problem solved.
[00:48:00] <csws> everything recovered fine
[00:48:00] <SpeakerToMeat> csws, yes I know, but still... no.
[00:48:11] <SpeakerToMeat> hah
[00:48:25] <CableNinja> A-KO, you do it for the tiering or ??? just because?
[00:48:41] *** Quits: bomb (~bomb@user/bomb) (Quit: nini)
[00:48:44] <csws> bomb but read speeds
[00:48:44] <csws> oh
[00:49:02] <csws> dude
[00:49:06] <csws> old job had a 48 drive RAID 6
[00:49:10] <A-KO> CableNinja: I used to use tiering, but tiering sucks because you have to use a static size and can't use a dynamically sized space. I do it because ReFS + Storage Spaces can self-heal data when you've got integrity streams turned on
[00:49:11] <CableNinja> everyone talks about resiliency for raid but fuckin forgets about read/write speeds
[00:49:15] <csws> it took so fucking long to recover when a drive failed in it lol
[00:49:15] <A-KO> and can basically automagically solve bitrot
[00:49:19] <csws> and it caused another drive to fail while rebuilding
[00:49:24] <csws> at least RAID 10 rebuilds only stress the other drive in the set
[00:49:50] <csws> oh man my old RAID 10 was sooo fast
[00:49:53] <A-KO> 3-way mirror requires a minimum of 5 drives because of quorum
[00:49:58] <csws> it was SSD cached too.. and the SSDs were in a RAID 10 as well lmao
[00:50:02] <csws> 4x400GB
[00:50:16] <A-KO> no hot spares though
[00:50:18] <A-KO> that would be nice
[00:50:27] <SpeakerToMeat> Sigh I need to find a good way to backup my home nas
[00:50:34] <A-KO> I've got at least another 5 spaces for drives in my desktop
[00:50:36] * csws snapshots

[00:52:18] <CableNinja> dd if=/path/to/backup | pigz -dck | zpool recv -vdU 
[00:52:40] <CableNinja> or... something like that, my brain hurt trying to remember work stuff on the weekend
[00:53:11] <csws> my homelab is powered by so many thoughts and prayers that I don't even backup the VMs anymore lol

[00:56:12] <CableNinja> to show the feature
[00:56:19] <CableNinja> A-KO, what about large files?

[00:56:30] <A-KO> CableNinja: what about 'em?
[00:56:38] <A-KO> you talking read or write hit?
[00:57:03] <A-KO> almost every file I access frequently on this volume is well over 1GB
[00:57:04] <A-KO> lol
[00:57:07] <A-KO> some up to 50GB
[00:57:09] <CableNinja> I was talking about read really, write isnt such a big deal usually as long as you've got the queue for it

[00:58:21] <CableNinja> <,<
[00:58:31] <A-KO> let's aim for a 15GB file
[00:58:40] <A-KO> yeah it's about capped at ~260MB/sec

[00:59:21] <CableNinja> I get 250MB/s on my home SSD raid1 pair
[00:59:25] <A-KO> CableNinja: This is my personal storage, though. For work I'd probably do some different stuff
[01:00:01] <A-KO> all SATA drives
[01:00:09] <A-KO> minus the SSD which is NVME/M2
[01:00:14] <A-KO> which isn't part of the space
[01:00:17] <A-KO> the SSD is just by itself
[01:00:32] <CableNinja> I've got a bunch of drives in my home system, but nothing wild
[01:00:34] <A-KO> it's also nice because I can add USB drives to the space also

[01:01:01] <CableNinja> I stole the M2 and rusty from my old laptop, plus a new NVME M2 and a pair of SSD

[01:01:49] <A-KO> CableNinja: yeah it's really easy to fuck up
[01:02:01] <CableNinja> but that may have been because the monkeys trying to set it up couldnt manage to keep it up for more than 2 days at a time and couldnt get it to backup
[01:02:02] <sd> 11<H​otmess> winRM > ssh 😉
[01:02:05] <A-KO> I think they're up to ReFS v4 right now
[01:02:13] <A-KO> hotmess: nah I give that one to SSH--minus the fact that the dev hates x.509
[01:02:18] <CableNinja> the last time I used / dealt with it was .... 8 years ago
[01:02:20] <A-KO> if he embraced x.509 I'd be fine
[01:02:26] <A-KO> CableNinja: yeah that's been a while lol

[01:03:40] <CableNinja> Hotmess thats because winRM tries to do more than 1 thing
[01:03:44] <A-KO> Telgareith: Depends on what you're considering is secure. Sure, SELinux is great--but Windows has 100% pure native hardware security, which is an area where linux environments are massively lacking
[01:03:47] <CableNinja> SSH is exactly that a communications layer
[01:03:50] <sd> 11<H​otmess> it dose yeah
[01:03:51] <CableNinja> nothing more
[01:03:55] <A-KO> it's not impossible to implement, they just don't.
[01:04:01] <CableNinja> its up to the system supporting it to handle the security

[03:08:20] <A-KO> personally, I don't think cars ever "pay for themselves"--the realistically best thing you can do with a car purchase is buy used, without a loan, and drive that shit into the ground.
[03:08:34] <A-KO> That's the only way you get the most value out of the car
[03:09:08] <A-KO> not only drive it into the ground, but basically to the point that either the engine breaks or car rusts. That said, with the costs of cars these days the engine replacement cost might not be a reason to get anything else LOL
[03:09:27] <A-KO> if you absolutely care about getting the maximum out of a vehicle
[03:09:51] <A-KO> right now used car prices are insanity, though

[03:16:26] <A-KO> it makes almost no sense to buy new if you care about the financials, and when buying used just buy private market in cash

[17:01:58] <PublicWifi> I'm not sure if I'm cut out for it
[17:01:59] <Lancehead> Reference: "Great employee, don't let him out of the cage after 10pm though" @PublicWifi
[17:01:59] <sintax> commission is hard though
[17:02:04] <PublicWifi> but there's no commission
[17:02:07] <PublicWifi> its base salary boys
[17:02:08] <sintax> you can kill it 6 months in a row and then boom. starving
[17:02:09] <fritzwastaken> PublicWifi: niiice. I took a 45% pay increase for this job and it was such an insane QoL difference
[17:02:14] <sintax> ooh nice
[17:02:20] <PublicWifi> apparently I'm doing 100% technical work but just custoemr facing
[17:02:22] <AnonymooseReddtr> sintax depends is it base salary + a small comission / bonus structure? 
[17:02:36] <AnonymooseReddtr> PublicWifi just make sure they have a solid support structure in place
[17:02:37] <PublicWifi> fritzwastaken: yeee WE'RE HEADING TO THE MOON BOYS
[17:02:45] <DrGibby> MACCAS: any bonuses based on metrics or anything?
[17:02:52] <AnonymooseReddtr> if its a small company you don't want to be the presales engineer, and the lead support engineer and the support whipping post etc
[17:02:58] <PublicWifi> DrGibby: yes!
[17:03:01] <DrGibby> Nice
[17:03:04] <PublicWifi> base salary + bonuses of some kind
[17:03:06] <Lancehead> support whipping post lol 
[17:03:20] <fritzwastaken> You ever have a big fart, so instead of trying to push the whole thing you just kinda leak it out so you dont hurt yourself?
[17:03:21] <PublicWifi> AnonymooseReddtr: yeah good idea! I have a few questions I wanna asked them on the next interview since its more formal
[17:03:30] <PublicWifi> fritzwastaken: the ol' lean n' squeek
[17:03:31] <fritzwastaken> I didnt have that forethought while sleeping and hurt my o-ring with a massive fart
[17:03:31] <Lancehead> fritzwastaken: no I try to make em sing 
[17:03:45] <fritzwastaken> woke myself and my cat up
[17:03:48] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol
[17:03:51] <PublicWifi> AnonymooseReddtr: yeah its a small company BUT the work load rn is insane they said
[17:03:51] <Lancehead> Give them just enough air to resonate a little you know 
[17:04:05] <Lancehead> I played seven nation army once 
[17:04:05] <PublicWifi> AnonymooseReddtr: apparently their SE to sales rep ratio is supposed to be 2:1 Sales:SE
[17:04:15] <PublicWifi> but they are expanding too quickly and its closer to 4:1
[17:04:20] <AnonymooseReddtr> ah
[17:04:23] <PublicWifi> its a small company too, like 100 employees
[17:04:31] <AnonymooseReddtr> sounds fun man
[17:04:32] <AnonymooseReddtr> good luck
[17:04:36] <PublicWifi> yeah I'm gonna give it a shot
[17:04:41] <fritzwastaken> Sounds like the change of pace you were looking for
[17:04:45] <PublicWifi> hard to turn it down even though it scares the piss out of me
[17:04:47] <AnonymooseReddtr> i like being in a customer facing role like that
[17:04:48] <PublicWifi> yeah!
[17:05:02] <PublicWifi> MAN
[17:05:05] <PublicWifi> IM HYPE

[17:06:11] <DrGibby> Let's see what shakes out 
[17:06:15] <fritzwastaken> Its so much easier when you already have a job
[17:06:19] <DrZak> man, these tenant to tenant migrations in o365
[17:06:24] <fritzwastaken> I used to do that when unemployed and it felt like Iw asnt doing shit
[17:06:25] <PublicWifi> you dislike your current spot or are you just wanting something new DrGibby ?
[17:06:26] <AnonymooseReddtr> DrZak yeah they suck
[17:06:32] <AnonymooseReddtr> DrZak whatcha doin?
[17:06:36] <fritzwastaken> why not both PublicWifi?
[17:06:50] <PublicWifi> point taken
[17:06:53] <PublicWifi> :D
[17:06:57] <DrGibby> MACCAS: company is just taking a direction with people that I'm not a fan of and won't be a good fit for long term
[17:07:08] <DrZak> about 2k peopl where 20% have 50+ gb mailboxes and 15% have over 600gb one drives
[17:07:10] <PublicWifi> if the company is taking a direction in which you are no longer a good fit
[17:07:14] <PublicWifi> that means they are going the wrong direction ;D
[17:07:18] <DrZak> +5tb of sharepoint garbage
[17:07:19] <PublicWifi> :3
[17:07:36] <DrGibby> Which is a nice way of saying they have idiots leading who won't listen to people who know what they're talking about 
[17:07:53] <DrZak> of course they want it in 2 months and cheap!
[17:07:55] <DrZak> ;]
[17:08:14] <DrGibby> It's almost end of Q1 and we don't even have a budget for this year

[17:09:01] <fritzwastaken> the biggest... bla...
[17:09:01] <DrGibby> We're a service company 
[17:09:03] <fritzwastaken> nevermind

[17:09:44] <Lancehead> dammit
[17:09:56] <AnonymooseReddtr> thats what MigrationWiz is built for
[17:10:18] <PublicWifi> inb4 you work for crowdstrike
[17:10:20] <fritzwastaken> point and shoot
[17:10:28] <fritzwastaken> +1 for MigrationWiz
[17:10:36] <PublicWifi> +1 for MigrationWiz
[17:10:37] <DrGibby> I'd love to work for crowdstrike, mandiant or rapid7
[17:10:46] <AnonymooseReddtr> mandiant just got bought out by google FYI
[17:10:58] <DrGibby> I'm aware 
[17:11:02] <AnonymooseReddtr> and yeah working in DFIR sounds interesting.  Not sure i"m cut out for it
[17:11:06] <AnonymooseReddtr> i like the slower pace of my role
[17:11:14] <AnonymooseReddtr> i can't do super high stress incidents anymore
[17:11:19] <DrGibby> IR is HIGH ENERGY 
[17:11:24] <AnonymooseReddtr> yeah
[17:11:30] <DrGibby> and a lot of fun
[17:11:35] <AnonymooseReddtr> often thought about applying to DART
[17:11:42] <AnonymooseReddtr> i don't have the technical chops for it though
[17:11:54] <Lancehead> My internship is high energy as well, and I DEFINITELY need something more chill as an actual job lol 
[17:12:03] <Lancehead> A year of this pace will be more than ehough 
[17:12:48] <AnonymooseReddtr> DrZak seriously though without 3rd party tools there is zero chance you will do that migration in that timeline with a good end user experience
[17:13:12] <vinrock> i prefer intense work
[17:13:14] <int0x1C8> finishing our migration from 2010 to 2016 exchange
[17:13:17] <vinrock> it makes your day go by a lot faster
[17:13:20] <AnonymooseReddtr> and I say that as someone who has done multiple tenant to tenant 
[17:13:25] <int0x1C8> less than 50 mailboxes to go
[17:13:29] <AnonymooseReddtr> vinrock hard to say man 
[17:13:42] <vinrock> bro theres nothing i hate more than the day dragging on
[17:13:42] <AnonymooseReddtr> vinrock i get that but at the same time I cannot be in the fire all the time
[17:13:46] <Lancehead> vinrock: I wouldn't mind intense work if it was one job... I have to run through the building 48 times a day
[17:14:06] <AnonymooseReddtr> i've done my time of the "world is on fire fix it" 
[17:14:06] <int0x1C8> speaking of which, am I supposed to migrate this DiscoverySearchMailbox{GuID} ?
[17:14:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> fuck that
[17:14:07] <Lancehead> And always have 3+ things to do at the same time 
[17:14:10] <vinrock> see i look at the ositive side of that
[17:14:15] <vinrock> you're keeping fit
[17:14:19] <vinrock> and being paid to do so
[17:14:30] <Lancehead> I'm also dying lul

[17:17:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> nobody complains and nothing breaks? then uninstall the services
[17:18:00] <int0x1C8> by remove you mean dismount not delete right?
[17:18:09] <AnonymooseReddtr> oh no i would delete em
[17:18:23] <int0x1C8> k
[17:18:24] <AnonymooseReddtr> if they are not in use there should be no mailboxes left in them

[17:20:21] <DrGibby> I'm aware :(
[17:20:23] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> Last on prem exchange server I decommissioned, the primary database had gotten corrupted and it was disgracefully dismounting 2-3x a week. Massive headache. Really wanted to set it on fire, but it was a VM.
[17:20:40] <AnonymooseReddtr> lol
[17:20:48] <sintax> pull the hdd the vm was on
[17:20:50] <sintax> same thing
[17:20:55] <AnonymooseReddtr> dmupp3t, allow me to regail you with a story. 
[17:21:04] <DrGibby> 🍿
[17:21:07] <AnonymooseReddtr> Customer complaint: Exchange Online sucks 
[17:21:26] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> Oh that was in an old and degrading SAN, the reason it was corrupt in the first place. We decommissioned that a few months later.
[17:21:42] <AnonymooseReddtr> so I went to meet with them and review the issues, get a feel for what was going on.   Turns out they had a partner do a cutover migration to Exchange Online but they setup AAD Connect and SSO
[17:21:43] <int0x1C8> yeah apparently when we migrated 2007 to 2010 something blew the fuck up and my boss had to manually reconnect everyone's database one by one
[17:22:15] <AnonymooseReddtr> and then at the end of it they just deleted the fucking exchange vm on prem
[17:22:21] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> lol
[17:22:25] <AnonymooseReddtr> so poor AD didn't know what to do. 
[17:22:50] <AnonymooseReddtr> According to AD bob@company.com was a mailbox hosted on exchange server <A> with a mailbox GUID of <blah> 
[17:23:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> Outlook AutoDiscover? fucked
[17:23:04] <AnonymooseReddtr> Mailfow? Fucked
[17:23:09] <AnonymooseReddtr> creating new users? was a crapshoot
[17:23:11] <int0x1C8> yep then once everyone was on 2010 with the databases reattached they just straight deleted the old 2007 server
[17:23:13] <AnonymooseReddtr> Permissions ? fucked
[17:23:29] <AnonymooseReddtr> that was super fun to un-fuck
[17:23:39] <int0x1C8> so there was a bunch of stuff I had to un-fuck when installing 2016 in the first place
[17:24:34] <AnonymooseReddtr> int0x1C8 yeah that does'nt sound like fun
[17:24:42] <AnonymooseReddtr> oh mupp3t was that failing SAN a Dell product by chance
[17:24:51] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> No, HP. And it was just OLD.
[17:24:57] <ender> last year I was migrating client's Exchange 2010 to 2016, but before I could do that I had to delete the remnants of Exchange 2003 from AD
[17:25:04] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> And poorly maintained.
[17:25:41] <ender> when that migration was about 75% done, the old server imploded, and some mailboxes (for users long gone) were still pointing at the non-existing 2003 server
[17:25:55] <AnonymooseReddtr> ender ycuk
[17:26:00] <AnonymooseReddtr> yuck
[17:26:26] <AnonymooseReddtr> this is all really good evidence to show that most SMB businesses have zero place running their own exchange infrastructure
[17:26:37] <PublicWifi> ^
[17:26:38] <int0x1C8> yeah I've had to use ADSI quite a few times to delete or fix old refs
[17:27:05] <ender> last week I had to connect their on-premises Exchange to Teams so they could share calendars
[17:27:06] <int0x1C8> like in progress move requests for AD users that haven't existed in over 5 years
[17:27:32] <teh_f4ll3n> I'm so tempted to just reply "jfgi" to 80% of the questions our new guy is asking me
[17:27:38] <sd> 06<d​Mupp3t> I migrated them from on prem exchange to Google Workplace. Which wasn't bad except setting up the connectors to run in a hybrid. All mail flowed into Google then a copy was also sent to the on-prem exchange. Problem was when users still on exchange sent an email to another user still on prem.
[17:27:52] <ender> also, they have licenses for 365 through ministry of education, but prefer to use their on-premises server
[17:27:57] <teh_f4ll3n> latest one is "what is spell check?"... seriously?

[21:07:27] <bloody> Hunterkll: what will you do with it
[21:07:28] <DrGibby> we took down the memes on the office signage after we found out

[21:07:38] <DrGibby> he was a good sport about it, though 
[21:07:53] <Hunterkll> bloody: between the t-mobile home internet kit, local cable co, and starlink i should be able to avoid any internet outages at all now

[21:15:04] <CptLuxx> the ping on starlink isnt that bad..
[21:15:04] <bomb> maybe he's from Australia
[21:15:04] <vinrock> comcast
[21:15:10] <CptLuxx> could be even better on cross continet

[21:15:49] <vinrock> ha yeah thats the one on 11/23
[21:16:03] <Hunterkll> then 2/25/2022 i got "YOUR STARLINK IS READY!"
[21:16:04] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:16:15] <Hunterkll> they give you 7 days from that notification to either order, or they refund the deposit
[21:16:25] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> i appreciates docker
[21:16:34] <vinrock> looks like theres a faster option now too
[21:16:37] <vinrock> 500 down/40 up
[21:16:44] <vinrock> im stuck with 10 up from comcast
[21:16:48] <Hunterkll> it's not orderable yet
[21:17:04] <vinrock> yeah im hoping it will be by the time mine is available to order
[21:17:12] <Hunterkll> but it's not necessarily a "faster" option so to say
[21:17:19] <Hunterkll> it just has more antenna/surface area
[21:17:23] <vinrock> ah
[21:17:29] <Oliber> i thought starlink ping was around the 50ms mark; and if your only option is shit or garbage, it has a place.  gotta make sure you've got a good sky view for it though, else you'll end up with outages
[21:17:30] <DrGibby> @NinjaStyle: I appreciates you
[21:17:34] <Hunterkll> "more than double the antenna capacity"
[21:17:39] <vinrock> well thats what id hope to avoid, buying redundant hardware when id just want the bigger one
[21:17:54] <vinrock> oliber, 20-40ms
[21:17:59] <Hunterkll> Oliber: I mean, my average latency for FPS games is around 50-60 because of my ISP routing, so 
[21:18:01] <vinrock> thats competetive with cable in some areas
[21:18:08] <Hunterkll> my ISP only peers with sprint and cogent lol
[21:18:32] <Hunterkll> I have lower latency to NYC then I do washington DC, and i'm far closer to DC 
[21:18:45] <Hunterkll> like, about 150 miles closer 
[21:18:46] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:18:47] <Oliber> yeah under 50ms is absolutely fine for most gamering
[21:19:08] <Hunterkll> oh
[21:19:14] <Hunterkll> vinrock: you can reserve starlink premium.....
[21:19:16] <Hunterkll> today....
[21:19:19] <vinrock> oh snap
[21:19:26] <Hunterkll> $500 deposit, total hardware cost $2500, and $500/mo service 
[21:19:34] <fritzwastaken> big oof
[21:19:45] <Hunterkll> hey at least starlink has native ipv6 these days now

[21:20:15] <vinrock> hm
[21:20:21] <vinrock> yeah i misssed that $500/mo part
[21:20:24] <Hunterkll> normal will be fine 
[21:20:35] <Hunterkll> it's not like it's my primary connection anyway, so lol
[21:20:48] <vinrock> for that price i could just get a 250mbit edi line my company would cover half of

[21:22:44] <DrGibby> whatcha fuckup?
[21:23:01] <Hunterkll> vinrock: get the t-mo home internet kit
[21:23:02] <Hunterkll> seriously
[21:23:10] <DrGibby> also, had a dream the other night that I found a RCE in norton btw
[21:23:17] <vinrock> its sometihng about how the towers are prioritizing
[21:23:23] <DrGibby> thought that was timely 
[21:23:29] <Hunterkll> in fucking *Socorro NM* I was getting 100mbit+
[21:23:40] <vinrock> i have one tower about 3/4mi behind the terminal and another one about 1.5mi to the west
[21:23:45] <vinrock> dayum
[21:23:47] <Hunterkll> when the only other option was local shit DSL and the closest real city was 1-2 hours drive away
[21:24:05] <Hunterkll> literally we had to drive to albequrqie to buy the kits
[21:24:06] <Hunterkll> lol
[21:24:10] <Hunterkll> just to get non-shit internet
[21:24:11] <Hunterkll> haha
[21:24:16] <vinrock> jesus
[21:24:37] <Hunterkll> but the hardware's "free" (return when cancel service) and the price is $50/mo for unlimited data 
[21:25:12] <Hunterkll> obviously, slightly deprioritized, but the only time I noticed issues is when the like one of two backbones going into town was malfunctioning, and it impacted everything from verizon cellphones to the DSL provider to leased lines

[21:26:51] <Hunterkll> and, of course, it's a home internet consumer router with not much options in the UI and no passthroguh functionality
[21:27:01] <Hunterkll> so you'll end up double NAT'ing if you use it as a failover WAN
[21:27:03] <vinrock> ugh no passthru fucks everything up tho

[22:26:23] <nobyk> MASTER GIBBS
[22:26:27] <nobyk> WHY IS THE RUM GONE?!
[22:27:13] <SpeakerToMeat> Question, anybody know any reason why a third party SAS DAS shouldn't work on an HP server? not that I have one that doesn't work, just to know if it might fail, and why.
[22:27:40] <Hunterkll> erm
[22:27:44] <SpeakerToMeat> Also, the problem with iLO not sensing thermals in some non HP branded/firmwared drives, could this extend to a DAS via an HBA?
[22:27:49] <Hunterkll> if they're standard SES enclosures, then it just works 
[22:27:50] <Hunterkll> and yes
[22:28:11] <Hunterkll> I have two NetApp disk shelves hooked up to a Dell R730, and before that they wre hooked up to supermicro boards
[22:28:17] <Hunterkll> it also worked on my DL380 too

[22:28:45] <Hunterkll> of course, the DL380's a Gen 5 with a .. P400 controller so ...

[22:29:54] <DrGibby> more/less what I did/do
[22:30:02] <DrGibby> seems like a good fit
[22:30:03] <SpeakerToMeat> Hunterkll, do you have any idea about the iLO and thermals?
[22:30:09] <Hunterkll> I'm just using a straight HBA for both shelves (Adaptec one i got off amazon) 
[22:30:17] <Hunterkll> no idea on that but like I said, it probably won't see them
[22:30:21] <Hunterkll> because of the stupid firmware restrictions
[22:30:28] <fritzwastaken> DrGibby: Very very cool
[22:30:39] <PublicWifi> Do you guys think, on average, if you run an "equivalent" VM stack on Linux vs Windows using the same hardware, you'd end up using less power?
[22:30:51] <DrGibby> yeeee :) 
[22:30:53] <Hunterkll> negligible 
[22:31:08] <PublicWifi> say a QEMU/KVM stack of 5 VMs doing the same job a hyper-v stack would do with 5 vms doing the same jobs as windows
[22:31:09] <SpeakerToMeat> Hunterkll, I want to buy Ironwolf (probabyl Pro), 12TB drives, I know one person (in one forum) used 8TB Ironwolf drives in a Gen8 (mine's gen9) and didn't mention the thermal "runaway" problem, but I wonder if those thigns are carried over the sas to the DAS or not
[22:31:10] <PublicWifi> sad
[22:31:22] <Hunterkll> I'd almost point at hyper-v as being more power efficient, even if baseline isn't, because of higher VM density/vCPU organization 
[22:31:40] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> prob depends too on your VMs
[22:31:42] <PublicWifi> trying to cut down my homelab power usage haha
[22:31:43] <Hunterkll> of course, 1:1 i'd also say negligable
[22:31:51] <PublicWifi> without buying new hardware ;D
[22:31:54] <SpeakerToMeat> PublicWifi, I'd say the biggest difference there would be on the things you're running on the Host (Dom0)
[22:31:58] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> like if they are all windows VMs then prob hypoer-v would optimize better
[22:32:03] <Hunterkll> SpeakerToMeat: they do carry over, if it's all the same controller
[22:32:10] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> hyper-v
[22:32:13] <Hunterkll> SpeakerToMeat: if you're just slapping a random HBA in there, why would you think the iLO would see it?
[22:32:27] <Hunterkll> Hyper-V is better for VM density, regardless of guest OS type ;)
[22:32:35] <PublicWifi> my poor t3500 is just old now
[22:32:39] <Hunterkll> but that's due to its usage of xen-style scheduling as opposed to whole block scheduling 
[22:32:39] <SpeakerToMeat> Hunterkll, yeah that's what I was expecting... the internal is a P840ar, the DAS will be hooked to an H241
[22:32:43] <nx032> You'll have more luck installing solar panels than switching oses if you want to drop your power consumption
[22:33:02] <Hunterkll> SpeakerToMeat: H241? iLO might see that, might not 
[22:33:19] <PublicWifi> if I had a newer machine it would likely use a lot less power
[22:33:19] <Hunterkll> PublicWifi: R730's are like $1k these days on ebay with a decent loadout :)
[22:33:39] <Hunterkll> mine came with dual 10 core procs, iDRAC enterprise license, 64GB DDR4 ram, and all drive sleds, etc
[22:33:43] <PublicWifi> we actually have a couple R730s that are getting replaced in oct I could prolly get my hands on lol
[22:34:01] <PublicWifi> but those are overkill for my homelab needs
[22:34:20] <Hunterkll> I upgraded from the supermicro equiv of the R710 generation, and before that was on the supermicro equiv (with far more memory) of the 2950 generation
[22:34:20] <Hunterkll> lol
[22:34:31] <PublicWifi> I've thought about trying one of these pico PSU's for my homelab server bceause they are insane efficient ata low power
[22:34:49] <PublicWifi> but they are kinda... chinesium

[23:42:21] <DrGibby> we have no reference to what "backend" and "frontend" are, what type of application, and ultimately, what you're trying to do

[23:42:44] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> You could do a reverse ssh port forward lol
[23:42:45] <awmv> The frontend app is calling an endpoint on the internet and If I run this app on my local machine it still calls that endpoint. I want to map that endpoint to my local one

[23:45:04] <DrGibby> I suspect all you need to do is run whatever you need on 443 locally and drop the ports and that should do you good
[23:45:05] <sd> 06<N​injaStyle> You could probably do that through a local proxy server like squid. Kinda a pita tho
