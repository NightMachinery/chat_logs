[14:08:54] <farn> acagastya: The height of the parent? I guess it depends on what you want to achieve exactly. If the parent is only as tall as the child then centering is kind of pointless. But maybe giving a padding to the parent also does what you want.
[14:09:16] <farn> And if you want to set the height on the parent but not on the child then you can play around with setting align-items and/or justify-content to stretch

[14:21:13] <entuland> I don't know that program - you can create some patterns with, say, linear gradients, but that's pretty much it
[14:21:21] <entuland> anything more than that requires SVG or images
[14:22:39] <acagastya> Well, think of it as a paper-like texture.

[14:29:05] <farn> NCS_One: I'm kind of curious what you found

[14:29:16] <entuland> that's a very stupid idea
[14:29:24] <farn> Thought so. Keyboard navigation exists though
[14:29:58] <entuland> use JS and set the disabled property correctly
[14:30:57] <NCS_One> entuland: I only need this because user has JS disabled
[14:32:11] <entuland> the only thing your page needs JS for is for disabling a text field depending on another field?
[14:32:22] <NCS_One> farn: right, but also can use `tabindex="-1"`
[14:32:40] <farn> Then the form is unusable for keyboard users
[14:32:52] <NCS_One> right
[14:33:04] <NCS_One> this isn't very good option

[14:36:38] <NCS_One> entuland: this is for a form with some optional elements, if JS is enabled the user clicks on some radios and the optional elements are showed or hidden, if user doesn't have JS enabled all fields are showed and can insert values on the optional fields even if the radio is set to `No`
[14:37:11] <NCS_One> soo I'm trying to find some solution
[14:38:05] <p_stampy> Is it a custom form you've built too?
[14:38:28] <entuland> the form should be clear enough to convey the fact that if such things are optional, they will be ignored on submit
[14:39:17] <entuland> at most you could help conveying that by changing the color or marking such fields depending on the radio buttons
[14:40:17] <entuland> ignoring useless values on the server side is easy even if they get submitted, trying to force the client from submitting them is hard and could easily get you into usability issues depending on the solution you choose
[14:40:18] <NCS_One> entuland: the optional fields only are validated on the server if the radio is `Yes`, if the user can insert values into them even without setting the radio to `Yes` it is misleading
[14:40:38] <entuland> it is not misleading if you state it in the form
[14:41:31] <entuland> people are smart enough to correctly fill in paper forms with similar scenarios often, it's not like you have to _force_ them no matter what even if they happen to have JS off
[14:42:22] <entuland> also, that kind of dependent elements is redundant
[14:42:37] <entuland> if a field is optional, just tell the user not to fill it
[14:43:01] <entuland> I mean, the option saying "yes" or "no" is redundant
[14:43:58] <entuland> mind you, this is just my POV and my preference
[14:48:15] <entuland> if anything, you could use "display: none;" to completely hide the text field depending on the state of the radio button, but I find it a poor solution
[14:49:55] <entuland> (and it wouldn't prevent the field from being submitted - it would be just as a visual aid for the user about what will and what will not be taken in account)
[14:54:20] <NCS_One> my problem is that I made the option yes or no part of the form, its a field of it soo submited. But you are right, going to find a way without it beeing a field of the form
[14:56:00] <entuland> if you are concerned about JS being off, you could also consider how bad the page / form would break with user-side CSS overrides, text browsers, text-to-speech for visually impaired and so forth
[14:56:26] <entuland> ideally, your HTML should work "decently" even stripped off of all CSS
[14:56:32] <p_stampy> Woah, considering all the things are we :p
[14:58:36] <entuland> the actual readable text in the form can explain how the form will be interpreted on submit, will survive any JS / CSS stripping and will be shown to everyone no matter what (it was just to clarify the "let the form explain itself" point)

[16:40:59] <entuland> did you test it with the mobile simulator in the dev tools?
[16:41:25] <entuland> the behavior should be the same on a narrow desktop window and on a small viewport on a device
[16:45:16] <birkoff> well it wasn't , until I added a media query with flex-basis: and order:
[16:51:00] <entuland> ok

[17:17:52] <birkoff> how can I make inputs' height less bulky ? this has nothing to do with the label wrapping
[17:18:40] <entuland> take in account that the widgets are OS / browser dependent, you can style them to an extent but you don't have many guarantees about it
[17:18:55] <entuland> also define "bulky"
[17:19:29] <entuland> the room around the text in the inputs is there to allow for good readability with capitals and letters that extend under the baseline
[17:22:45] <birkoff> they fill up vertically
[17:22:54] <birkoff> where there are two lines (wrapped) in the same container 'row'
[17:23:00] <entuland> can you show it?
[17:23:05] <birkoff> it gets higher than where there is only one line
[17:23:23] <birkoff> now this looks like the text is causing it to fill up
[17:23:44] <birkoff> but I guess some spacing consideration can make it grow even when there is only one line
[17:24:00] <birkoff> https://jsfiddle.net/k7tgz4ad/1/
[17:24:04] <entuland> check margins, paddings and also the line height
[17:24:14] <entuland> oh
[17:24:26] <entuland> sure, they're adapting to their allowed space
[17:24:32] <entuland> you can simply force their max-height
[17:25:49] <entuland> or give them a fixed height in em or something
[17:26:05] <entuland> actually better if you go for the height and not the max-height, so you're sure they're consistent
[17:26:59] <entuland> technically that's the flex layout that is "inflating" them

[17:27:44] <entuland> I think you're overdoing with divs and flex all over the place there
[17:28:44] <entuland> a single wrapper for each "label - input" pair would do, if you really need a wrapper
[17:29:35] <entuland> all those rows and cols wrappers look overkill, you're not taking advantage of the flex / grid layouts in full and you're likely limiting your rearranging options with that divitis
[17:30:46] <entuland> the markup ideally would be the minimal necessary to convey the structure
[17:31:51] <entuland> <form><label><input></label><label><input></label></form> is the bare minimum you can aim for, and it is possible to style it neatly without any additional markup
[17:33:02] <entuland> the best solution lies somewhere in between, with maybe just a wrapper around <label></label><input>, with a fitting "for" property to the labels, to make styling easier (as you'll have separate control over the label and the inputs)
[17:33:15] <birkoff> it's there so the input+label align nicely
[17:33:41] <entuland> no, you definitely don't need all of those divs to do a nice alignment
[17:33:58] <entuland> you're simply not taking advantage of the flex/grid layouts

[22:00:32] <entuland> this is slightly more than the bare minimum flexing to do something similar to what you had in your fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/6n3vxLfk/
[22:01:01] <entuland> mind you, if you want to make things way stricter and enforce the layout with more control, there is no point in using flex at all
[22:01:09] *** Quits: whytwulf (~clf59@user/clf59) (Client Quit)
[22:01:38] <entuland> the point of flex is doing such kind of fluid rearrangements where you don't care about outputting a strict "table like" layout
[22:04:35] <hassoon> ya his markuo is pretty too much for a mere label/input pairs form

[22:41:16] <birkoff> what does strict table mean ? I do care about the table wrapping into one column when display is narrow
[22:57:03] <hassoon> birkoff: what table ? you're into making up a label/input pairs form
[23:19:13] *** Joins: wintersky (uid453465@id-453465.brockwell.irccloud.com)
[23:32:21] <entuland> strict "table like", not strict table
[23:32:56] <entuland> anyways, you have a sample and the references about what you can do with flex
