[00:08:14] <upgreydd> Hey. I have a question. Let say I need to run multiple postgres queries which I have in string. I'm using psycopg2. When i use `cursor.executemany(queries, [])` all is fine but I can't get moddified rows (cursor.numrows which I need). When I try with `for q in queries: cursor.execute(q)` i have number of rows but some queries fails due to new line breaks in string (where with executemany same query works). So my idea is to
[00:08:14] <upgreydd> detect separate whole queries in string and run them with for loop. Is there any module for that or maybe there's magic param to do something with cursor.execute?

[01:48:21] <jan6> if I try to use a variable that's not declared in the same file it NameErrors, only workaround I've found so far is to just put everything inside a function and put the data in the function arguments

[01:52:46] <nedbat> jan6: there are ways to use variables across files, but they are globals at that point, which also gets unwieldy.  You might consider creating a class with attributes instead of independent variables.

[06:46:48] <tempate> I'm writing a spelling corrector. I have a text and I want to replace words with their corrections. For it I used to have: re.sub('\w+', lambda m: corrector(m.group()), text). I want to replace this and send context to the corrector function.

[06:47:53] <tempate> So now I have a list which is basically the text stripped out of punctuation and the like and with sentence separators. This is the big list. The one I'm really interested in, just the words, is a subset of this list: it's exactly the same but doesn't have the sentence separators.

[06:53:57] <nedbat> tempate: it seems like you derived the short list from the long list, so why try to put them back together?
[06:54:18] <nedbat> tempate: in fact, the pairs you get are always either (x, x) or (x, None).  You aren't getting much information from them.
[06:54:27] <phy1729> Seems like it's be easier to just have one list and modify in place
[06:54:56] <tempate> nedbat: yeah, right, I'm realizing that was a stupid example
[06:55:26] <Omega037> So I have a CSV in which a column is basically a dict, but naturally pandas reads it in as a string
[06:55:35] <tempate> phy1729: but if I'm going to only have one list it has to be the big list, and I don't know how to modify in place since I've lost the position of things in the actual text
[06:55:37] <Omega037> I fix this by doing an eval() on it
[06:55:52] <Omega037> But I am concerned that it is a dangerous/bad thing to do
[06:55:57] <nedbat> Omega037: it is
[06:56:07] <Omega037> In theory, others could modify this file
[06:56:10] <nedbat> Omega037: do you have any control over the creation of the csv?
[06:56:15] <Omega037> Sure, I created it
[06:56:33] <Omega037> Is there a way to create a CSV while retaining the JSON nature
[06:56:39] <nedbat> Omega037: ok, then use json.dumps to make the column at least, so it's JSON instead of python data.
[06:56:57] <Omega037> The problem is that non-technical people will be needing to modify it
[06:57:03] <Omega037> Probably in Excel
[06:57:13] <nedbat> Omega037: well, you said it had a dict in the column

[14:32:47] <sveinse> If I have a package with mypkg.__main__.py I will need a `if __name__ == '__main__'` construct in it to support both using the package with `python -m pypkg` and setuptools' console entry points, right?
[14:33:30] *** Joins: blindguard (~blindguar@2a02:908:1864:c200::4433)
[14:33:49] <sveinse> I mean `python -m` seems to execute the __main__.py file, while the entry point expects a function to run
[14:37:03] <jinsun> if your entrypoint function lives in __main__.py then yes, otherwise no
[14:38:22] *** Joins: Wuniu (~Thunderbi@user/wuniu)
[14:38:33] <sveinse> jinsun: yeah, I'm using the same entrypoint as -m in this case. Good. I suspected I had missed something. Thanks.
[14:38:39] <jinsun> sveinse: see for example black doesn't need the if __name__ thing because the entrypoint is in another module, https://github.com/psf/black/blob/main/src/black/__main__.py
[14:39:17] <jinsun> sveinse: but mypy needs it because they defined the entrypoint in __main__.py https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/mypy/__main__.py
[14:39:19] <sveinse> jinsun: but that wouldn't work with entrypoints would it?
[14:39:48] <jinsun> why will it not work?
[14:40:15] *** Joins: chenxuezhao (~chenxuezh@120.244.238.36)
[14:41:48] <sveinse> I got it. We're on the page.. I meant that you'd need the __name__ == '__main__' construct to use your __main__.py together with entrypoints, which your latter link confirms, so all good!
[14:43:39] <sveinse> Some __main__.py examples out there goes straight into code without using a function, and *that* wouldn't work too well with entrypoints, as it required a function
[14:44:29] <jinsun> yeah you would have to wrap it in a function if you want the same behavior for the entrypoint as -m

[16:42:59] <molt> whoa. nice. I'm having issues scraping a page. basically when I run the find_all() method on my BeautifulSoup object the contents I am getting are only from the header and footer of the page.

That version of the code works
[16:42:59] <molt> PERFECTLY. In other words, when I run the find_all() method on the BS object I parse out all the data properly and get the results that are expected.

[17:01:08] <Cheaterman> I'm working on embedding Python in a game server. The API is (essentially) a set of callbacks that are called from my plugin (think Â« def OnPlayerCommandText(playerid): Â» ) that users are supposed to implement as methods of their module - and this works very well
[17:02:07] *** Quits: NeilRG (~NeilRG@192.222.196.111) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[17:02:08] <Cheaterman> But I'm very sad about the singular in Â« their module Â» - I would like them to be able to import other modules, and my plugin would call these modules' methods too.
[17:02:56] <Cheaterman> I was thinking of how best to approach this - I could iterate over sys.modules from C and do something equivalent to "if module_name.startswith('python.')", but this doesn't seem very efficient
[17:03:49] <The-Compiler> Cheaterman: one approach is using decorators to register a class or function as a plugin/hook

[17:04:49] <Cheaterman> I was wondering if there was some sort of mechanic that would easily help me filter these modules - regarding my previous sentence, about the "python." part, the idea is that my plugin imports the "python" module of the user (and calls its methods) but I would like the user to be able to make this a package instead, and I'd call the methods of all modules inside that "python" package

[17:07:23] <Cheaterman> Perhaps it could make more sense if I do something akin to "from python import *" from the C API side of things (and register a list of modules myself - filtering out other variables) instead of the current equivalent of "import python"
[17:08:20] <Cheaterman> Or perhaps I could hook into the import mechanic itself but that sounds a bit risky/overkill

[22:19:54] <bjs> R0b0t1: I'm not gaslighting, I'm saying it's highly unlikely you have a bug in asyncio here;  maybe you do but it's very unlikely you have a bug in the done()ness of the Task
[22:20:29] <bjs> that's why I'm asking the questions I am (e.g. about awaits and about cancellation) because those are places that can easily have logic bugs that can cause the symptoms you see
[22:21:04] <R0b0t1> it *doesn't even run the read*
[22:21:07] <bjs> e.g. if your do_terminate triggers then you won't notice the fact the loop stopped spinning possibly
[22:21:09] <supakeen> foo, generally strings normalized into e164 format (for phone numbers)
[22:21:09] <R0b0t1> it just pauses there
[22:21:18] <bjs> R0b0t1: pauses?
[22:21:32] <foo> supakeen: thanks, I'll stick with strings then. Yeah, I believe e164 was the format I was using. Appreciate it. :)
[22:21:35] <R0b0t1> stop being a pedant bjs
[22:21:55] <R0b0t1> I eventually found out what you're *supposed* to do: StreamWriter has a is_closing() method that can be used as an event, so I'm using that
[22:22:07] <bjs> R0b0t1: I'm not.  I've been part of debugging bugs in asyncio before,  I know what they look like.  This doesn't look like an asyncio bug and you certainly aren't being convincing about it

[22:32:22] <bjs> foo: there is a library called `anyio` that may (*may*) be of some help
[22:32:58] <bjs> in that it gives you a way to code to the trio interface but if your libraries use asyncio, to use asyncio as the backend instead
[22:33:42] <bjs> but you can't mix-and-match libraries that do what I say above: if library A imports asyncio directly and does things and library B imports trio directly and does things, you can't really use A and B together
