[02:21:04] <Snuupy> is there any better solution than to set up zfs for thelounge logs? can't split up the sqlitedb into multiple files and still have search working, right?
[02:21:17] <Snuupy> zfs + compression*
[02:22:21] <bookworm> not how it works no
[02:22:57] <bookworm> you'd need to put a proper db behind it, Nacht has a patch somewhere or at least planned to do it
[02:23:45] <Snuupy> is there a benchmark for how much I can expect zfs compression to reduce the database size by?
[02:24:00] <Snuupy> I've been reading about compression algos for the past half hour and it's a lot of numbers
[02:24:13] <Snuupy> online they're saying "use zstd"
[02:25:20] <bookworm> no idea, measure it
[02:25:28] <Snuupy> I will have to, yeah
[02:25:31] <bookworm> I don't use zfs
[02:25:38] <Snuupy> but then I have to check between diff algos
[02:25:50] <bookworm> out of tree filesystem on Arch, *very* poor choice
[02:26:11] <bookworm> zfs broke due to kernel like 3 times already
[02:26:22] <bookworm> and that's since I keep track
[02:26:29] <Snuupy> rip
[02:26:41] <Snuupy> what would you consider using besides zfs?
[02:27:02] <bookworm> I wouldn't even consider zfs ;)
[02:27:14] <Snuupy> yeah so what would you consider instead besides no compressio at all
[02:27:14] <bookworm> btrfs / ext4
[02:27:16] <Snuupy> compression
[02:27:27] <Snuupy> oh interesting
[02:27:48] <bookworm> not sure if ext4 can do compression, btrfs certainly can
[02:28:10] <bookworm> don't use raid5/6 and you shozbe fine stability wise
[02:28:16] <bookworm> should*
[02:28:27] <bookworm> that raid mode is known broken
[02:28:40] <Snuupy> I did read about that, yes - I only have 1 disk on the VPS anyway
[02:28:54] <Snuupy> don't really care about redundancy cus I'm backing up configs and if I lose logs then I lose logs lmao
[02:28:57] <bookworm> else it's pretty neat, will be the default root fs on Fedora next release
[02:29:10] <Snuupy> what will the fedora users using raid5/6 do
[02:29:26] <bookworm> you generally don't put your root in that raid mode
[02:29:58] <Snuupy> I've seen hetzner servers offer RAID1 on their root/system drive, is that standard?
[02:31:30] <bookworm> depends
[02:31:44] <Snuupy> "standard" as in - is that what people who run servers prefer to do?
[02:31:52] <bookworm> different raid levels have different performance / storage utilization profiles
[02:31:52] <Snuupy> what other ways do they do it with redundancy?
[02:32:02] <Snuupy> I've seen RAID10 used as well
[02:32:10] <Snuupy> well - for a home server, what would you use?
[02:32:22] <bookworm> jow many discs do you have?
[02:32:25] <Snuupy> 1
[02:32:27] <Snuupy> LUL
[02:32:34] <Snuupy> technically 3
[02:32:39] <bookworm> then you can't do anything but raid0
[02:32:50] <bookworm> meaning no redundancy at all ;)
[02:32:50] <Snuupy> well, depends on which server we're talking about
[02:32:54] <Snuupy> raspberry pi NAS has 4 disks
[02:33:07] <Snuupy> online VPS has 1 disk on root, other VPS has 2 disks
[02:33:18] <Snuupy> but the 2nd VPS itself is already on a server managed RAID10...

[18:24:18] <Snuupy> yeah I was going to run backups via rsync or something
[19:04:04] <aab_> I use duplicati now native install to Ubuntu not in a container 
[19:04:36] <aab_> Encrypted backups
[19:05:24] <aab_> Iâ€™m also toying with the idea of moving my website NS over to cloudflare. 
[19:13:34] <bookworm> seems a bit overkill for a personal website
[19:17:12] <aab_> it's not a personal website
[19:17:37] <aab_> I meant my services that I have on my docker, needs a domain name for ssl
[19:22:15] <bookworm> "services" which you access via http are websites...
[19:22:21] <bookworm> by definition
[19:23:40] <aab_> alright
[19:25:15] <bookworm> why not just use a normal nameserver? cloudflare is a proxy meant to protect the backen server
[19:25:46] <bookworm> not sure how busy your "services" are but I can't imagine that you need ddos protection
[19:27:21] <aab_> it's free why not
[19:28:11] <bookworm> *insert if it's free you are the product here*
[19:29:17] <aab_> I'm ok with that
[19:29:30] <aab_> am I a product of the lounge chat then? :P
[19:29:44] <aab_> do you harvest my data without me knowing? lol
[19:29:55] <bookworm> note that if you anyhow buy a domain that namecheap eg already gives you a name server you can use
[19:30:45] <bookworm> and yes, TL sucks away your life, minute by minute spent arguing on IRC ;P
[19:31:43] <bookworm> in all seriousness, bit of a difference between a commercial company and some rando who likes to poke at software don't you think?
[19:33:16] <aab_> I use my free domain that I got on namesco for a year, I got 3 .co.uk domains free will change after a year
[19:33:48] <aab_> there's a massive difference between a commercial company and some rando that likes to poke
[19:33:50] <aab_> 100%
