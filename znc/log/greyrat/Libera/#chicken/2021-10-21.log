[00:05:32] <Zipheir> Hah.  I was halfway through making an egg for SRFI 61 (the generalized cond clause) before realizing CHICKEN already provides it by default.  Not the first time I've missed something mentioned on (and only on, it seems) the "supported standards" page.

[08:57:06] <Guest-liao> Is there same available symbols for external to link in the libchicken.a file and libchicken.so file during compilation with one of them as the input? 
[08:57:50] <Guest-liao> I mean in term of chicken stuff.
[09:01:43] <Guest-liao> What I find out is that for import symbols like 'chop' from the chicken.base module, the script don't  need (import (chicken base))
[09:04:18] <Guest-liao> Whatever './csi -s hello.scm' or 'csc hello.scm & ./hello
[09:07:21] <Guest-liao> But the symbols like 'conc' from the chicken.string module, the script do need (import (chicken string)) for running ./csi -s hello.scm' or 'csc hello.scm & ./hello
[09:11:37] <Guest-liao> But the point is both symbols 'conc'  and 'chop' are in libchicken.so file.

[09:22:36] <Guest-liao> Both of them are same, only need to change to like 'chicken.string#conc'
[09:23:30] *** Joins: fantazo (~fantazo@192-164-154-92.hdsl.highway.telekom.at)
[09:25:05] <Guest-liao> Basically, the exported symbols in the libchicken.so  file doesn't need to (import (chicken $module-name) ) in the scripts.
[09:33:02] *** Quits: shawnw (~shawn_w@c-73-225-121-73.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[09:34:30] <sjamaan> Guest-liao: That's true, but it's a internal implementation fact you probably shouldn't rely on
[09:35:14] <sjamaan> (import (chicken string)) sets up the identifiers like conc from (chicken string) as aliases for chicken.string#conc
[09:35:37] <sjamaan> It also registers the library from which these identifiers are exported as used, so you don't need -uses
[09:35:58] *** Quits: ublx (~ublx@user/ublx) (Quit: ublx)
[09:38:19] <Guest-liao> Yeah. It is an internal implementation. The script is like ignore the internal. The internal things are so complex.
[09:41:02] <Guest-liao> when we are talking about the user script, sound like (import (chicken string)) is kind of like rename symbols. Then start the scheme programing.
[09:56:22] <Guest-liao> Sound like I talked with mangol about this before.

[12:44:01] <zilti[m]> mario-goulart: thanks! No, I just happened to use the official method to install an additional component in NetBSD, forgetting that the official install method is, well... completely broken... Using NetBSD was a mistake. All data still there, I just can't access the server.
[12:44:27] <zilti[m]> First thing now is having to at least get my email stuff working again
[12:45:13] <sjamaan> yikes, that sounds pretty horrible
[12:45:31] <sjamaan> Did you use pkgsrc to build from source without a chroot, perhaps?
[12:47:06] <zilti[m]> Nope, I wanted to install plan9port, which requires the monolithic X11 (for whatever reason...) and I used the sysinst tool to install that component. Forgetting that sysinst is utterly broken.
[12:48:30] <sjamaan> wow
[12:51:19] *** Joins: Guest-liao (~Guest-lia@101.86.103.113)
[12:51:24] <zilti[m]> I don't remember correctly what all is broken, but basically it overwrites what the system uses to mount the hdd, ignoring that since the disk is over 1 TB it can't use the native method, and also reinstalls the kernel etc., despite me only having selected the X11 component
[12:51:31] <zilti[m]> It's a horrible mess
[12:52:13] <Guest-liao> what?
[12:52:33] <zilti[m]> Guest-liao: NetBSD
[12:52:44] <Guest-liao> installing X11 component made that happenedï¼Ÿ
[12:53:01] <zilti[m]> Yea
[12:53:16] <Guest-liao> by chicken?
[12:53:54] <Guest-liao> or just install X11 component  in NetBSD
[12:57:04] <Guest-liao> I almost install mini-OS. depend on what it need, then install components. But X11 like desktop thing, I always think for a while
[13:04:51] <Guest-liao> mangol https://github.com/edn-format/edn
[13:09:41] <zilti[m]> Just installed X11 component in NetBSD. Unrelated to Chicken. Only reason I mention it in here is because I did that on my homeserver where I host a few eggs
[13:10:25] <zilti[m]> Just ordered a vServer now to set up the email stuff at least
[13:14:09] <sjamaan> heh, this is weird: we're talking about NetBSD and I just saw an email from someone who is tasked to read my Master's thesis for uni, which was somewhat about NetBSD
[13:15:42] <sjamaan> Nobody ever contacted me about that because it's a piece of irrelevant stupid research
[13:15:52] <sjamaan> Or so I thought
[13:19:11] <Guest-liao> what is the research?
[13:19:30] <sjamaan> Using a neural network for scheduling processes
[13:19:55] <Guest-liao> It is for your master degree or PH degree
[13:19:59] <sjamaan> Master's
[13:21:26] <Guest-liao> Part of my master degree is about mesh the sheet.
[13:21:30] <mangol> process scheduling in the kernel?
[13:22:01] <mangol> did it work well?
[13:22:32] <sjamaan> No, there's not really enough information flowing back from the UI subsystem in UNIX to make decisions
[13:23:15] <sjamaan> The idea was to make multimedia processes take priority to ensure smooth playback of audio and video, but there's very little info in the kernel regarding video output especially
[13:23:46] <sjamaan> Guest-liao: What do you mean by mesh the sheet?
[13:24:05] <mangol> would have to add a sysctl() which libraries like ffmpeg can set to indicate they are playing video
[13:25:38] <mangol> re: installer, all of the BSDs' installers have always had lots of weird bugs and mysterious menus in my experience
[13:26:21] <mangol> i assume they would appreciate a lot if someone goes in and makes them more logical (except OpenBSD, who tend to be irritated whenever outsiders claim their stuff isn't perfect :)
[13:28:51] <sjamaan> heh
[13:30:47] <mangol> OpenBSD and Common Lisp have remarkably similar attitudes, in that there is an inner circle who feel everything was perfected in the 90's, and only the incremental changes they make are blessed according to the canon. would be interesting to know how those group dynamics comes about; one assumes the devs are fundamentally similar people as in all other communities.
[13:32:32] <mangol> GNU is a bit of the same as well. things that are "part of the GNU system" are ipso facto good, apparently regardless of what those things are.
[13:34:34] <Guest-liao> a sheet, people need to an algorithm to split to it into small pieces of triangles or small pieces of quads.
[13:35:48] <sjamaan> Ah right, layout problems
[13:35:55] <sjamaan> Those can be very tricky
[13:36:04] <Guest-liao> It ended up to test a algorithm, by set the different parameters to verify the quality( as much as triangles  and so on) 
[13:37:31] <mangol> triangulation with constraints?
[13:42:35] <Guest-liao> pointï¼ˆx,y,zï¼‰of these triangles and quads is that the solver of mechanics is needed.
[13:44:28] <Guest-liao> Like triangles are more stable.
