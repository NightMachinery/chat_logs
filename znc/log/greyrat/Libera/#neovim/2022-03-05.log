[00:00:19] <mjlbach[m]> dundargoc: ...no, it does not do either

[19:44:08] <nova> consider the nvim_set_keymap under https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide#vimapinvim_replace_termcodes .. I wonder about performance vs a map that doesn't use lua. The lua function calls vim.fn..., so it's still calling vim-script and in the end, it is still going to be evaluated in the expression register. I don't know which would win, though, and I must say I am curious about the general case
[19:45:46] <clason[m]> why not test and benchmark it yourself then?
[19:46:05] <nova> bc I don't want to
[19:46:21] <clason[m]> then it shall forever remain a mystery...

[21:18:13] <nova> fun fact. vim uses g:maplocalleader and neovim uses g:localmapleader. lol
[21:18:18] *** Joins: hololeap (~hololeap@user/hololeap)
[21:19:01] <nova> that was a fun little 2-min detour that isn't documented >_> even :helpgrep failed
[21:20:57] <clason[m]> where do you get localmapleader from?
[21:22:06] <clason[m]> because I call fake news on that.
[21:22:07] <nova> huh. Somehow when I was rearranging my config, I renamed it. I don't know how. Yet somehow it still seems to work.
[21:22:27] <nova> let me grep for maplocalleader to see if it's actually set properly somewhere else.
[21:22:44] <clason[m]> then I suggest removing it and being amazed that yet it still works
[21:22:59] <clason[m]> (meaning, you're observing `mapleader` in action)
[21:23:06] <nova> is maplocalleader by default only one backslash? I thought it was two? I am confused
[21:23:35] <nova> my <localleader> maps need only one backslash
[21:24:06] <clason[m]> > // If "mapleader" or "maplocalleader" isn't set use a backslash.
[21:24:15] <clason[m]> from keymap.c:920
[21:25:38] <nova> ~ooo~ heheh
[21:26:47] <nova> I reconfigured that stuff so long ago that I thought maybe there was a reason for it, but it turns out I was just stupid and it worked despite the error
[21:27:30] <nova> in 0.7.0 is the only way to make autocmd with vim.cmd?
[21:27:50] <clason[m]> no
[21:28:26] <clason[m]> nvim_create_autocmd
[21:32:11] <nova> really? that isn't in nanotree's readme or :help, and when I do :lua print(vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd) I get nil. :ver says 0.7.0-dev+1125-..
[21:32:46] <clason[m]> that version doesn't exist (anymore
[21:32:47] <clason[m]> * exist (anymore)
[21:33:06] <clason[m]> when people talk about 0.7.0, they mean the current HEAD
[21:33:25] <clason[m]> (until it gets released, when HEAD will report as 0.8.0)
[21:34:05] <clason[m]> and nanotee's guide -- as great as it is -- is not official and under no obligation to cover prerelease features.
[21:35:27] <nova> huh. I hadn't pulled for just a few days. pretty new.
[21:35:48] <nova> I got the magic sauce now
[21:36:43] <nova> does anyone want to judge some janky lua I wrote to initialize a bunch of lua files and put any errors in the quickfix list?
[21:37:00] <clason[m]> I prefer not to.
[21:37:26] <clason[m]> * I would prefer not
[21:38:11] <nova> (it's not that janky, and okay lol)

[21:46:27] <nova> if your username on that website is not clason, and you're curious about said script, please see https://bpa.st/SKOQ - I'd love to lean about things if I am doing them wacky. First lua script, so might be some oddities
[21:48:39] <nova> I forgot to add a usage section at top. by default add files to ~/.config/nvim/lua/init/ directory (after putting that file in lua/), and then in init.lua, do require'start'.init()
