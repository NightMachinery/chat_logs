[00:01:31] <bobdobbs> thoughts so far on jumping from hacking with jQuery to learning React: making the transition is very challenging and requires quite a comittment. Much (maybe most?) of the tutorial material available online seems to be written for people who are very good at programming generally, know js and the DOM API very well. So it's one has to take in a large amount of very cerebral information.
[00:02:16] <bobdobbs> I have to keep zooming out from tutorial material to thinking about what problems the design of modern frameworks are designed to solve.

[00:06:12] <bobdobbs> I think the commitment is especialy required because there isn't much of a "bridge" from jQuery hacking to React. I can know *just enough* to hack behaviours with jQuery. My impression is that there is an abyss between that and implementing React in  a very basic and practical way.
[00:06:56] <bobdobbs> But yeah. I'm enjoying learning new things and I'm looking forward to implementing something with it.

[00:15:12] <bobdobbs> KevinX: Yeah. I think one of the reasons that I'm trying to learn it is that it's been a while since I really put sustained effort into learning something new.

[02:54:41] <KevinX> friend i'm not following. Are you in the right channel?
[02:54:56] <friend> I hope so.
[02:55:27] <KevinX> whats a key builder or a keyboard factory?  and it it on screen meaning in the browser?
[02:55:52] <friend> I have a javascript that creates an onscreen keyboard that can't be the built in browser onscreen keyboard
[02:56:15] <friend> so since i have a ton of elements that are similar, I figured I'd make a function to build  the elements
[02:56:16] <KevinX> is it a library or something you're building from scratch?
[02:56:21] <friend> yes, sorry
[02:56:37] <KevinX> yes it's a library?
[02:57:09] <friend> Tell ya what, this is not as easy o a question as I had hoped. Rather than waste your time, I'll just work on it and ask questions when I get it closer.
[02:57:25] <KevinX> i dont mind personally but just need more clarification
[02:58:37] <friend> like right now, I would like to have a function that builds a "<div class='kb_btn'><label>X</label></div>" element so I could pass it a string of characters like QWERTYUIOP and it would build keyboard buttons for each.
[02:59:03] <friend> But if I am going to pass a string, perhaps some keys I need to pass more than a string. So now I have to pass an object to the script that builds the keys.
[02:59:15] <KevinX> you could load a json file?
[02:59:42] <KevinX> or objects too
[03:00:07] <friend> I thought json was for single pairs can I pass an object in json? (looking it up now)
[03:00:21] <KevinX> you just buil dthe interface and each keyboard type just has to be compatible
[03:00:45] <KevinX> it depends where the config is coming from
[03:01:45] <KevinX> if from the server, use json, otherwise objects
[03:01:52] <friend> https://codepen.io/cuirPork/pen/VwMorOK
[03:02:38] <friend> Seems like a bunch of stuff for the interface. I figured I could generate it more programmatically than just a hunk of html. Not sure which is better.
[03:03:25] <friend> The idea is that I would be able to call the keyboard class with some parameters that would only include the pieces I needed
[03:04:24] <KevinX> i think you'll struggle with an imperative approach like this
[03:04:50] <KevinX> you'll need a bunch of if/else conditions to handle everything

[03:07:13] <friend> Some parts aren't needed in every instance. Like the CTRL, SHIFT and ALT aren't needed in the email keyboard or the pone keyboard, for example.
[03:07:42] <friend> It would have labels for most used parts, but also allow you to include any parts using "custom" type and them list the parts

[03:09:24] <friend> That's what I was planning. What data type would you pass that in? Just an object?
[03:09:46] <KevinX> Yeah sure if it's al in JS
[03:10:36] <friend> Would you write a class for the buttons? then instantiate a new button?
[03:11:26] <KevinX> Personally I wouldn't but you can.
[03:12:08] <KevinX> I avoid oop in js, but others here probably think i'm crazy. I dunno
[03:14:53] <friend> Yeah it's hard when you are just learning to figure out where to spend your energy. Every time  I start in one direction, there's a new direction that's better. I do appreciate the help and the perspective.. I just may not be cut out of development, really.
[03:15:25] <KevinX> you could do this easier with something like vua or alpine js which has inline key bindings

[03:17:40] <friend> Never for production, but just trying to learn it for a couple of years in my free time. I can make things but they are ugly by the latest standards.
[03:18:38] <KevinX> well its just like learning the piano or something. you sound crappy for a while then you start sounding better. just keep at it
[03:19:09] <friend> Thanks. Will do. I appreciate the support.
[03:19:29] <KevinX> You might like vuejs. I think codepen has it built in to work without needing to set up a bundler
[03:20:27] <friend> vue>react?   I ahve been hesitant to start using other people's code without understanding the fundamentals, but maybe that would be a good path.
[03:20:48] <KevinX> its been awhile for me, but then you'd write <v-for"char in [a,b,c,d,e,f]"><button v-on:keypress[char]="handlePress">
[03:21:34] <KevinX> vue and react are both good
[03:22:05] <KevinX> Well, you're using jQuery so its a different paradigm
[03:22:19] <KevinX> vue might be easier to pick up
[03:22:45] <KevinX> with react you bring your own JS, while vue has a lot of help built in

[11:51:27] <sheetjs> hmw[at]: about mental linting
[11:51:30] <sheetjs> "nlike most (all?) other languages, the ternary operator in PHP is left-associative rather than right-associative. The left-associative behavior is generally not useful and confusing for programmers who switch between different languages. "
[11:51:34] <hmw[at]> One can only hope it is consistent and carries meaning. Anything else would be crap
[11:51:47] <sheetjs> "An analysis of the top 1000 composer packages found 12 instances that will be affected by this RFC. 9 of them are bugs, where a right-associative meaning was intended, but a left-associative one will be used."
[11:52:41] <KevinX> sheetjs wow i never knew, I would just use () by default there
[11:52:57] <hmw[at]> I intentionally said "mentally FIRST". I meant, I try not to have it in my IDE and I don't run the real linter every time, I try something.
[11:53:28] <hmw[at]> And yes, switching between languages, or even if they mix 4 languages into one file. Ooof
[11:54:10] <KevinX> to be fair, i dont think i'd ever write something like that anyway lol

[12:21:02] <systemfault> Crockford was about removing the gotchas of the language.

[13:06:47] <wyre> hi guys, I've downloaded a template for a personal site from bootstrapmade ... and I was trying to learn some javascript 😊 My point is ... I'm checking the main.js and I can see some functions are defined like this https://bpa.st/MGPQ
[13:07:19] <silly> wyre, those are arrow functions
[13:07:22] <hmw[at]> Those are "arrow functions"
[13:07:22] <wyre> my question is ... the only difference is that apparently these functions aren't defined until these lines, according to this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33040703/proper-use-of-const-for-defining-functions
[13:07:42] <silly> that's called temporal dead zone
[13:07:47] <wyre> I mean this https://stackoverflow.com/a/33040926

[13:08:47] <silly> you mean, assigning the function to const rather than defining with function ...?
[13:08:48] <hmw[at]> in short, functions are "moved" to the beginning of the scope they are in, semantically.
[13:09:12] <wyre> hmw[at], yes, that's what I've been reading
[13:09:29] <hmw[at]> so they appear as defined, even though they are written only later on.
[13:09:36] <wyre> so why is appropriate these ones are constants and not be hoisted?
[13:10:06] <hmw[at]> I would guess I'd do that to protect myself from confusion about what is defined when
[13:10:10] <wyre> in the very same file, do you mean? 🤔
[13:10:11] <silly> that's just a code style preference
[13:10:53] <hmw[at]> wyre: if the functions are defined in the "global" scope, it is per file. If they are defined inside other functions, hoisting happens in the scope of that outer function
[13:11:08] <silly> in this case, arrow functions are different from regular functions though
[13:11:26] <silly> i mean preference in this case, but different in general
[13:11:58] <hmw[at]> I don'T like it when people use that for no reason. THe function key word is nice and cosy.
[13:12:30] <silly> i'd use the function keyword too here
[13:12:53] <wyre> well, actually the file starts with a `(function() {` so ... I guess it's a whole anonymous function (?)
[13:13:01] <hmw[at]> yes
[13:13:02] <silly> and semicolos :D

[14:07:23] <jwpapi> What’s a better way to write data properties? `<span data-currency-sign>` or `<span data="currencySign">`
[14:08:53] <silly> always data-something
[14:09:41] <silly> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*
[14:09:46] <jwpapi> thank you my friend
[14:09:53] <jwpapi> don’t fall for your username again
[14:10:28] <jwpapi> I probably also should be consistent and use data whenever I literally do data changes and only use classes for CSS
[14:12:12] <KevinX> is there really any performance benefit?
[14:12:16] <theskillwithin> dataset
[14:12:51] <jwpapi> So I think here I use data attributes for data and ids for style attributes https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/VojKyE5u/
[14:12:57] <jwpapi> Is that good style
[14:13:09] <jwpapi> KevinX: I don’t think it’s about performance it’s about separation of concerns
[14:14:16] <KevinX> if thats the case then i dont see a difference in which attribute syntax
[14:18:33] <Rockwood> silly, theskillwithin thanks yeah i was looking for that

[14:25:08] <jwpapi> KevinX: that’s about conventions than
[14:25:45] <gde33> I always ask how much work will it be to change this later.
[14:26:13] <gde33> If its a lot you better sit down and think about it some more.
[14:26:19] <gde33> If its not just go with what works
[14:26:46] <KevinX> i think your html wont validate if it has an object in a non data-* attribute
[14:26:52] <KevinX> "validate"
[14:27:01] <theskillwithin> not enuff people know about console.dir   you can use console.dir to log an element like its an object
[14:27:19] <gde33> yeah, I know it exists but never use it
[14:29:02] <silly> dom attributes can only ever hold strings
[14:29:21] <gde33> they also hold style and js :)
[14:29:22] <silly> or so i thought...
[14:29:35] <silly> style is string again
[14:29:43] <gde33> everything is binary
[14:29:55] <jwpapi> gde33: I’m trying to improve my coding style not to improve my project. So it helps me to know which is the widest accepted convention.
[14:30:29] <jwpapi> I know that select by id by class by data attribute by non data attribute by data attribute string all works
[14:30:41] <silly> there is no js attribute
[14:31:21] <silly> "To be more specific, attributes is a key/value pair of strings that represents any information regarding that attribute. "
[14:31:23] <jwpapi> I could also do `<span Idontcarewhatsillysays>` and `document.querySelector('[idontcarewhatsillysays]')` also works
[14:31:29] <gde33> you use ID for unique elements, class if it may occure more than once, you only style by data- or [say] href if it saves a bucket load of code
[14:31:29] <silly> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/attributes
[14:32:02] <KevinX> the validator will still look for something like {} i think, but who cares
[14:32:02] <jwpapi> gde33: I think you use data if it’s non-style related, but data
[14:32:10] <gde33> data is for data
[14:32:34] <silly> to pass data from server to frontend
[14:32:55] <KevinX> i would use data unless you're writing jsx
[14:32:58] <jwpapi> So when I have an API that is lazy loading information. In my case it’s figuring out the users location and then asking for the price in his currency. I think I should use data attributes and not ids or classes
[14:33:25] <KevinX> or not, who cares. Stay away from alpine of vue-petitie if you care :D
[14:33:43] <KevinX> or*
[14:33:46] <gde33> jwpapi: makes no sense
[14:34:21] <jwpapi> gde33: please elaborate?
[14:34:22] <gde33> jwpapi: they are unlrelated things
[14:34:40] <silly> you can use data-attributes with css though
[14:34:51] <gde33> that you can doesn't mean you should
[14:35:23] <KevinX> another hot take. you dont have to store data on an html element
[14:35:24] <silly> like data-currency="$" and then in css somehting like :before { content: attr(data-currency); }
[14:35:48] <gde33> KevinX: right, should only do that if it really saves a lot
[14:36:11] <silly> but i wouldn't store anything on elements either
[14:36:33] <gde33> go with "USD"
[14:36:47] <gde33> don't use before or after either
[14:37:19] <gde33> you only use the weird selectors when backed into a corner and without a way to escape
[14:38:54] <jwpapi> I’m loading a website and when the user first requests it I don’t know where he is from.
[14:39:05] <gde33> jwpapi: imho the place to improve for most would be to wonder if you can replace a class by selecting the parent
[14:39:47] <gde33> <foo id="usd" data-currency="usd">
[14:40:05] <jwpapi> So via Ajax I let him make a call to my website that responds with the price information in his home currency and based on that response it will update the DOM elements with the corresponding data attributes
[14:40:10] <jwpapi> I don’t see what’s wrong with it

[16:07:25] <jsmooth> Without something to transpile then JavaScript must be used to write applications that run by the browser.

[16:18:18] <jsmooth> Here's a much better question. How do I make the difference between a secure application that runs within the browser and a non-secure application?
[16:18:49] <jsmooth> I know FB is considered very insecure for private messaging, but there are banking type applications that are trusted as secure.

[16:20:50] <Maxdamantus> I don't think it's really accurate to say that FB is particularly insecure. Maybe you mean it doesn't take the same precautions as banking applications? I don't think people would expect FB to take the same precautions as banking applications, because it's already secure enough without them.
[16:20:55] <cis> It depends on what you mean by secure.
[16:21:17] <cis> Secure against what or whom?
[16:21:51] <Maxdamantus> eg, banking applications will typically require reauthentication whenever you use them while FB will allow you to use your cookie even if it's been inactive for a month or whatever.

[22:24:00] <ramblebamble> I am now certain, leaflet js with open street maps does not set markers when used in nuxt and put in production mode , does anyone know why?
[22:24:23] <ramblebamble> or what I might have done wrong/
[22:24:25] <ramblebamble> ?
[22:24:32] <matsaman> most likely it is more than just that you have set it to production mode

[22:25:09] <ramblebamble> matsaman, no this is the minimal code with window.tMap being the map-object created
[22:25:11] <ramblebamble> window.L.marker([20.0,40.0]).addTo(window.tMap)
[22:25:39] <ramblebamble> I start the page with yarn dev all is fine, I do the same with `yarn build && yarn start` with build-target server and no markers show
[22:28:46] <matsaman> maybe the imagery is no longer available

[22:38:40] <ramblebamble> @han-solo @matsaman, no  it is not directly that issue
[22:40:33] <ramblebamble> maybe a variation, but a good pointer, apparently what happens with my setup is that the url gets appended a ')"marker....." with the png prior the ')' having a short handline marker.XXXXXX.png the file does exist and the file after the marker exists, but the url given to the browser is obviously bogus

[22:41:52] <han-solo> it seems you can override the url ?
[22:41:55] <ramblebamble> I would've expected to see broken icon-images at the least though... but good thing is that I now know that it is a url/css issue

[23:12:57] <ramblebamble> han-solo, but overriding the corresponding icon-properties directly by creating a 'custom' icon with the default values did the trick
