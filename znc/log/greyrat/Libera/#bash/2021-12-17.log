[01:01:54] <wiscii> rendar: it does not `grep` anything
[01:02:06] <rendar> huh?
[01:02:13] <rendar> wiscii, actually that function greps lines
[01:02:21] <wiscii> is there a wiki "regexp vs shell-pattern" ?
[01:02:31] <wiscii> it does not grep anything
[01:02:38] <greycat> one of the BashProgramming pages discusses it a little
[01:03:10] <greycat> https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashProgramming/02#Strength_reduction
[01:03:18] <wiscii> rendar: a shell-pattern is not a regex .. grep uses regex .. your script uses shell-pattern
[01:03:26] <rendar> wiscii, i know, so?
[01:03:40] <rendar> wiscii, that script has been adviced to me here, today, some hours ago
[01:03:54] <rendar> wiscii, problem is with variables, if you use grep, it's not safe
[01:04:04] <earnestly> greycat: Hm, I've not familiar with this concept
[01:04:11] <rendar> grep "${a}.*${b}" or whatever, is not safe
[01:04:53] <earnestly> greycat: (I agree as well, but it also means that if I have to pay the cost for a stronger tool then I might as well do more in it)
[01:05:55] <earnestly> rendar: What is this function actually intending to do?  The problem is in the name of your function, trying to do two things instead of one
[01:06:04] <rendar> huh?
[01:06:11] <earnestly> So, depending on what it's trying to do, you might be able to break it apart
[01:06:16] <rendar> it greps lines according to 2 patterns: the start of the line and a middle string
[01:06:31] <wiscii> in bash there is =~ for regex
[01:06:41] <earnestly> Yes I gather that, you're just conceptually describing what I can see the code is doing
[01:06:44] <greycat> earnestly: there is definitely a point to be made about rewriting the script in the more powerful language *if* you're going to call on that language in the first place.  This is definitely true for perl.  Not as clear-cut for awk being called from bash.
[01:06:46] <Soliton> they don't want regex.
[01:06:56] <Soliton> they want to look for literal strings.
[01:07:05] <earnestly> greycat: Although awk does tend to creep
[01:07:42] <rendar> wiscii, i don't need regex there
[01:07:45] <earnestly> Eventually it's just an awk script with a #!/bin/bash head
[01:07:47] <greycat> Of course the absolute *worst* is the novice who thinks, "Hmm, I'll use awk to extract this one piece of data from this one string.  Then I'll call it again to extract the second piece...."

[01:11:35] <rendar> wiscii, this function mimics grep in everything
[01:11:36] <earnestly> greycat: It pops up a lot in poor statusbar style scripts which read from sysfs/procfs files every second or so

[11:08:53] <ormaaj> When you want anything declare does
[11:10:54] <janko> I looked up a few references on declare, did not understand the main use, but I read somewhere they were equivalent, so I wanted to know how to differentiate them
[11:10:59] <ormaaj> There's one context where an assignment is the same as declare with no options in the global scope.
[11:12:31] <pj> even then it's not the same
[11:12:40] <Soliton> you use declare to give variables attributes.
[11:13:00] <Soliton> you need it to declare associative arrays for example.
[11:13:28] <ormaaj> You could say the "main" use is to declare local variables.
[11:13:44] <pj> # foo=$(echo 1; false); echo "$foo: $?"
[11:13:45] <shbot> pj: 1: 1
[11:13:50] <pj> # declare foo=$(echo 1; false); echo "$foo: $?"
[11:13:51] <shbot> pj: 1: 0
[11:13:57] <pj> see, not the same ^^^^^

[11:22:00] <janko> Sorry, I must have asked my question the wrong way. I will try to be a bit more specific. I am trying to learn how to implement a fifo and someone showed me an example that started with "declare -r fifo=/tmp/timer_fifo", I did not understood this command, so I googled a bit, and on a stackexchange answer someone said it was the same as =, and so I asked how are they different, but my real doubt is
[11:22:02] <janko> what does the command above does
[11:22:29] <Soliton> !readonly
[11:22:29] <greybot> Variables marked readonly (declare -r) are intended to be used with a restricted shell, to stop you from trivially changing PATH to escape the restrictions (etc.). They were never intended to be widely used in scripts. If you try, you will see odd results (-r at a global scope is passed down to local scopes).

[15:33:28] <Fernando-Basso> versions=(~/.nvm/versions/node/16.13*)

[16:41:55] <DPA> At least the rename(2) system call is documented as being atomic. I'm sure it's fine in almost every case.

[17:08:48] <FreeBDSM> well, the problem was actually presented on a meeting and I screwed up publicly suggesting that this is just how 'job control works' (although jobs are not even involved here + it's not how it works)
[17:09:28] <Soliton> jobs are likely involved. envoy & starts a background job.
[17:09:45] <Soliton> in an interactive shell anyway.
[17:09:59] <FreeBDSM> yeah, but I suggested that if parent script exits - it sends sigterm to all its children
[17:10:11] <FreeBDSM> and that's not how things work as I realized later
[17:10:19] <Soliton> that is wrong in general, yes.

[19:55:51] <ifohancroft> Hi! I know this isn't strictly a bash question, but I'm having trouble sorting a file. I have a file with the following structure: id,domain I want to sort it based on the id, numerically, ascending, preserving the id,domain pairing. For the sorting, I am using 'sort -nk1,1 <filename> > <filename>-sorted'. The file is too big to examine by hand so I am looking at it with 'head' and 'tail'. Looking at
[19:55:53] <ifohancroft> the output of 'head' it looks sorted, however when I check the output of 'tail' there are some domains with ID like 900 million, then the next row is an id 1 billion something, then 2 billion something, then another id 700 million. Am I missing something or am I doing the sorting wrong?
[19:57:19] <Soliton> -t,
[19:57:43] <Soliton> comma is not the default field separator.
[19:57:45] <emanuele6> the default delimiter is TAB, yo uneed ,
[19:57:59] <ifohancroft> Of course! I am an idiot. Thank you!
[19:59:03] <ifohancroft> As expected, it now works as expected.

[21:41:41] <Soliton> rendar: so why did they say that?
[21:42:01] <rendar> Soliton, people here showed that some solution involving "regex...$a" would be buggy sometimes
[21:42:22] <Soliton> so you have no idea. so maybe don't repeat stuff you don't understand.
[21:42:23] <rendar> with some value of $a
[21:42:28] <rendar> huh?
[21:42:32] <rendar> i don't have the logs

[21:42:39] <rendar> but i have the idea how it can be buggy
[21:42:40] <Soliton> indeed and you cannot explain it.
[21:42:46] <Soliton> show it then.
[21:42:49] <rendar> if i set a="something that would mess the regex"
[21:42:49] <yitz> Either you failed to describe the problem fully or you failed to understand the solution

[21:43:09] <Soliton> continued bs.
[21:43:14] <rendar> ok ok
[21:43:17] <rendar> i'm losing time
[21:43:23] <rendar> i will use python, thank you :)
[21:43:26] <Soliton> you can be a regex guru and it wouldn't help you.
[21:43:33] <yitz> lol
[21:43:41] <ponies> python has worse regex
[21:43:52] <rendar> at least, it's a programming language
[21:43:55] <Soliton> because the issue is outside of regex. that is the basic point you should have understood.
[21:44:21] <Soliton> python does not change anything about understanding the issue.
