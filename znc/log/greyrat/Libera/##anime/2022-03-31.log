[06:46:53] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: my friench friends thinks it is extremely important that I study the Mexican political arena and actually vote in Mexican elections
[06:47:13] <Fenderbassist> and how do you feel about it?
[06:47:14] <amigojapan> friend*
[06:47:21] <Fenderbassist> it's not a bad idea if it's something you can do
[06:47:31] <Fenderbassist> unless it's a difficulty
[06:47:35] <ButterNoodle> *I heard that in hakozume today and had to see if liberties were taken in the translations.. but it was correct - wanted to know if I understood it
[06:47:49] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: it is definitely dificult
[06:48:04] <Fenderbassist> ok then you have to evaluate if it's something you can manage or not
[06:48:17] <Fenderbassist> like I wouldn't want to have to fly back just to vote
[06:48:19] <Fenderbassist> that would be so expensive
[06:49:09] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: oh, I think there is an equivalent  to an absenteee valet, but the dificult part is knowing who is actually good to vote for
[06:49:32] <Fenderbassist> that would probably require reading a web page or two
[06:49:43] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: my image of Mexican polliticians is that they are all corrupt
[06:49:45] <Fenderbassist> to see if you agree / believe their claims
[06:49:53] <Fenderbassist> agree to*
[06:50:04] <Fenderbassist> that's not a stretch to believe :)
[06:51:13] <Fenderbassist> a politician being corrupt....have I heard that before?
[06:51:17] <Fenderbassist> yeah like LOTS lol
[06:51:55] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: if I could figure otu which is "the lesser of the evils" that would probably be who I had to vote for

[09:19:36] <amigojapan> I had heard that akihabara has gone to poop since corona

[09:22:10] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: if it serves as any kind of consolation, there is a new SEGA arcade inside the new mall they built near my house
[09:22:18] <amigojapan> but mostly crane games
[09:22:39] <ButterNoodle> bet there arent many retro arcades these days
[09:22:51] <ButterNoodle> the console really ruined arcade gaming

[10:36:36] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: do you have a chest freezer
[10:37:09] <Nanobot> MC is a third gender: a yamale. Je looks mostly like a girl, except je has a spurgis between jir legs. When stimulated from inside, it excretes repum, which combines with sperm to make the chromosomes for more yamale offspring. To reproduce, a male must have sex with a yamale to get the repum, and then immediately have sex with a female to impregnate her. But, that takes a lot of effort and social skills, so MC masturbates to anime characters instead.
[10:37:25] <MootPoot> damn

[13:15:40] <amigojapan> welcome home jesse
[13:16:16] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: well the wasabi I know, clears the sinuses. What does real wasabi do?
[13:16:30] <Kill-Animals> and does it taste better?
[13:17:09] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: not a huge difference that I can realise, the fake stuff is quite simillar, IMHO, I am sure a michellin chef will murder me now
[13:17:44] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: both of them attack the sinusses
[13:18:05] <Kill-Animals> Interesting. 
[13:18:30] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: the real one is usually served as a root which you need to grind yourself tho.
[13:18:49] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Interesting
[13:19:36] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Its kind of a joke here for people who try sushi for the first time, to tell them the green stuff is avacado. Does that joke exist in japan too?
[13:20:29] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: not as a joke , but avocado has become quite popular in Japan lately, it is imported from Mexico
[13:21:06] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: do they have avacado rolls and california rolls in Japan?
[13:21:15] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I guess the thing is that it is hard to find someone in Japan that has never tasted it yet
[13:21:27] <Kill-Animals> figured
[13:21:52] <amigojapan> no Kill-Animals, actually rolls are quite uncommon kind of sushi, nigiri sushi is what people usually call sushi here
[13:22:17] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: ahhhh thats interesting. I wonder why?
[13:22:57] <Kill-Animals> cucumber rolls = worst. Negitoro rolls = best. My two cents
[13:22:58] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: somehow rolls are what got popular in the west, food is not usually authentic

[13:30:52] <Kill-Animals> MootPoot: awesome to hear. Do you miss carbs at all? I know I occassionally miss perogies
[13:31:34] <MootPoot> kinda but not really - I might go off it one day every 2 months or something or I'll just eat a little to get rid of the craving
[13:31:37] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Hey do they have perogies in japan? Its probably the most popular western dumpling
[13:31:48] <MootPoot> but mostly I've just satisfied myself with low carb alternatives
[13:31:54] <Kill-Animals> MootPoot: such as?
[13:31:58] <MootPoot> coconut flour bread
[13:32:01] <MootPoot> etc
[13:32:09] <MootPoot> its close enough
[13:32:12] <Kill-Animals> ah yeah. And you call my diet expensive
[13:32:25] <MootPoot> nah, its not as expensive as yours
[13:32:32] <MootPoot> I still eat veggies
[13:32:59] <MootPoot> my meals are like 40% meat, 20% fat then the rest is veggie filler
[13:33:00] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: you mean gyouza?
[13:33:02] <Kill-Animals> I could spend 5 bucks on ground beef and that will hold me over for two days.

[13:33:34] <amigojapan> Then no Kill-Animals 
[13:33:39] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: They are hardly even similar either. Perogies are usually potato and cheese filled, served with saurkruat and sour cream

[13:34:45] <MootPoot> I used to spend 500 or more

[13:35:55] <MootPoot> tbh it might have just been that
[13:35:55] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: I think they have them at Russian restaurants
[13:36:01] <MootPoot> just not eating trash from outside
[13:36:05] <MootPoot> or prepackaged frozen shit
[13:36:29] <Kill-Animals> If I go to mcdonalds the closest I can get to anything I consider relatively healthy, or at least not unhealthy, are plain quarter pounder patties ( you eat them like a hamburger steak ) and a cup of milk/cream
[13:36:42] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: oh probably.
[13:36:49] <MootPoot> best I can get is if I go and ask for a lettuce wrapped quarter pounder
[13:36:53] <MootPoot> no bread bun

[13:37:44] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: yes. That does not ban Russian food tho
[13:37:50] <Kill-Animals> MootPoot: theyd do that? Usually the lettuce is chopped up

[13:48:33] <Kill-Animals> MootPoot: Well it does matter just because a lot of the so called drugs that are named multi-vitamins; they may have that chemical in them, but that does not mean they are not toxic, nor that your body can't absorb them. Iron Pills are a great example. You need HemaIron which you can only get from meat.
[13:48:58] <Zoidberg> sup MootPoot? you're up so late in night and having 'discussion' with Kill-Animals

[13:58:02] <MootPoot> with the new trade deal they forced us to open up our market to american milk
[13:58:40] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Well the other thing about it, is that nothing is stopping you from continuiing to buy canadian milk. But also that shit about hormones isn't even true. Thats just propaganda; You don't think our cows are heavily breeded and genetically engineered?
[13:58:42] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: they used the words, "incredibly high expense" for $2500-$3000
[13:58:46] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, Same ol' Canadian milk products are still available for purchase.
[13:58:58] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: so normally you don't get that much
[13:59:22] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, it's not propaganda. I've researched it myself and it holds out to be true.
[13:59:29] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: I know, I just mean afaik before it used to be only canadian - now you can get both canadian and american depending on which province you live in
[13:59:33] <Kill-Animals> Our cheese is prohibitively expensive. You can buy a tiny little slice of gouda for 20$

[14:00:35] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, that's a bunch of nonsense. Health Canada explicitly disallows the use of hormones. So American milk which is imported has to abide by the same standards.

[14:01:55] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: afaik https://dairyfarmersofcanada.ca/en/blue-cow-logo/producers is a direct response to american dairy in our markets
[14:01:56] <ImoutoBot> [title] Producers: Add The Blue Cow Logo To Your Products | Dairy Farmers of Canada
[14:02:00] <amigojapan> Zoidberg we also put chili powder on all kinds of fruits
[14:02:13] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Because eggs were not on our canadian food guide, until an egg lobby came in and lobbied the government. Then suddenly "Eggs became healthy" -- 
[14:02:14] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, and I'm completely fine with that. 
[14:02:24] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: sure, I was just pointing it out
[14:02:26] <Sapphirus> Most of the milk products I buy have that seal on it.
[14:02:31] <Zoidberg> lol amigojapan, crazy
[14:03:24] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, I do believe our government is corrupt enough to rival some countries in South America on some metrics.
[14:03:31] <MootPoot> Literally the only milk brand I see is beatrice
[14:03:32] <Sapphirus> But you'd have to source a citation for that one, because I just don't believe it.
[14:03:38] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: There is also the issue of Political Intrigue on behalf of the canadian dairy cartel. The whole reason the conservative party split into the PPC was because the Dairy Cartel Union bought 3000 memberships and bribed andrew scheer, and subsequently told him to boot bernier out of the party because he opposed supply management.
[14:03:39] <MootPoot> at my stores
[14:03:51] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: Mango with chili, orange with chili, watermelon with chili
[14:04:43] <amigojapan> Zoidberg not just chili but also salt and lime juice
[14:05:13] <Zoidberg> yeah, I know amigojapan, that's how you make it stick to glass
[14:05:14] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: And I am not making this up; At the following CPC convention, the dairy execs literally left behind a binder full of their malicious evil plans to shut down any discussion on making ending supply management a party issue, to the ponit where they even say that scheer will shut it down if need be.
[14:05:51] <amigojapan> Yup Zoidberg but I also meant on fruits and vegetables
[14:05:56] <Sapphirus> I think there's more to the CPC/PPC split than the Dairy Cartel.
[14:06:18] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: but yeah corruption here is just a joke these days. It could defintiely be worse, thankfully, but I have so little faith in our country these days. Can't believe trudeau called the emergencies act on the truckers.
[14:06:24] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: I can't understand spanish but it contains lime juice, soy sauce and chilli right?
[14:06:41] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Interesting. Whats your take on the split? 
[14:06:43] <Sapphirus> Way I like to put it is as follows: There are two versions of Canada; An image of Canada which people buy into, and then there's the real Canada hidden behind the veil.
[14:07:04] <Sapphirus> I don't doubt there is corruption, but you have to backup some of these claims with some evidence.
[14:07:15] <Kill-Animals> one sec,
[14:07:18] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: I don't remember soy sauce. Maybe they mean magi sauce
[14:07:44] <death916> there is a soy sauce factory by me from kikoman
[14:08:00] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: In the making I saw black soy like sauce
[14:08:01] <amigojapan> Zoidberg also ice and beer
[14:08:05] <mixfix41> and that evidence could be the appointees and their history if they have no history you got evidence then
[14:08:25] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: I found another one, what are written here? https://youtu.be/D0oE7o5NwZs?t=23

[14:14:18] <Kill-Animals> GRRR 
[14:14:23] <Kill-Animals> They make me so mad
[14:14:27] <MootPoot> lol
[14:14:35] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, that's greasy.
[14:14:53] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: hard to believe, isnt it.
[14:15:04] <Kill-Animals> Its like that simpsons episode with the monorail
[14:15:10] <Zoidberg> sexist nazi racist homophobes*
[14:15:21] <Kill-Animals> where the guy, Lile Lanley leaves his binder full of his evil plans behind.
[14:15:24] <MootPoot> is sex racist
[14:15:24] <Zoidberg> there's an order to adjectives in English
[14:15:29] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, as a sexual minority myself, I think it's not really fair to classify all conservatives as that. It's disingenuous as all hell.
[14:15:38] <MootPoot> what
[14:15:43] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: not if you love their race
[14:15:51] <MootPoot> racist sex
[14:15:53] <MootPoot> there we go
[14:15:55] <Zoidberg> joking
[14:15:56] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: No; All conservatives are sexists and homophobic. 
[14:15:58] <MootPoot> are you both happy now?
[14:16:07] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, I hope you're being sarcastic.
[14:16:10] <Sapphirus> :P
[14:16:11] <Kill-Animals> Otherwise they aint conserving nothing.
[14:16:22] <Zoidberg> me, happy?
[14:16:25] <MootPoot> I wish they got rid of the conservative label tbh
[14:16:46] <MootPoot> rename themselves to something else
[14:16:50] <Zoidberg> so just call them douchebags?
[14:16:54] <MootPoot> lol
[14:16:56] <Zoidberg> assholes?
[14:17:10] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: no. The most conservative a person can be while holding those social views of being pro-gay pro-abortion pro-women etc, is being an economic libertarian which is sort of "Conservative."
[14:17:13] <MootPoot> nah - I'm not that mean - just something that reflects their takes some more 
[14:17:20] <MootPoot> the boomer party
[14:17:23] <MootPoot> or something
[14:17:25] <Sapphirus> Umm, of all the people who proclaim to speak on behalf of minorities, I think the left embodies a lot of the labels they throw around.
[14:17:38] <Zoidberg> whatever happened with Matt Gaetz btw? haven't heard about him lately
[14:17:48] <Zoidberg> what's that pedophile upto?
[14:17:58] <MootPoot> who, me?
[14:18:10] <Zoidberg> Gaetz man, Gaetz
[14:18:23] <MootPoot> stupid politics aside
[14:18:25] <Sapphirus> Infantilisation of minorities is about the most bigoted you can strive to be.
[14:18:32] <Kill-Animals> MootPoot: Unironically this. The conservative party doesnt even have any social issues, and they support the big gay agenda. 
[14:18:43] <Sapphirus> When I see someone like MootPoot saying what he just said, I look at him and wonder "Does he hate gay people?"
[14:18:43] <MootPoot> can we vote to use the power of the canadian govt to make seagate start giving me some HAMR HDDs
[14:18:55] <MootPoot> pls
[14:19:00] <mixfix41> both parties operate under a ladder structure. somebody who works for somebdy.
[14:19:34] <Zoidberg> the conservative party has lot it's ideals long time back, they're just a shell of all those old ridiculous beliefs 
[14:19:38] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, I think the conservative party finally understands that they need to stay out of people's bedrooms.
[14:19:39] <Kill-Animals> PPC #1 -- go maxime bernier! 
[14:20:10] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: I support everyone undergoing a gender change to female and everyone being a lesbian
[14:20:18] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: uh no; they are feckless cowards who wont push back on sick disgusting homosexuality being pushed onto 5 year olds.
[14:20:40] <MootPoot> I have no idea what either of you guys are arguing for but whatever Zoidberg said sounds cool
[14:21:03] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, calling everyone who you define as a conservative as homophobic I perceive as a form of projection.
[14:21:09] <MootPoot> ???
[14:21:13] <MootPoot> when did I do that
[14:21:32] <MootPoot> There was supposed to be HAMR / MAMR HDDs I can buy already
[14:21:52] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Well Im catholic, I was orthodoxx jew, and I make no bones about homosexuality being disgusting.

[14:22:31] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, I humbly apologise. I accidentally attributed a comment Kill-Animals made to you.
[14:22:59] <MootPoot> Zoidberg: does dating a 17 year old count as pedophillia?
[14:23:13] <MootPoot> I thought pedophillia was strictly if you try to get with pre-pubecent kids
[14:23:15] <Zoidberg> "dating"
[14:23:17] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, what's that supposed to mean, exactly?
[14:23:47] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: :P
[14:23:59] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: LGBTQ+ sucks. I hope it goes away, permeanently. 
[14:23:59] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: dating any minor kids, yes. He wasn't dating though. It was prostitution. 
[14:24:05] <MootPoot> ah
[14:24:31] <Zoidberg> woah Kill-Animals, be careful, we're pro LGBTQ+ community here
[14:24:33] <MootPoot> do we even have laws against pedophilia explicitly - or is it just "any person under the age of consent"
[14:24:36] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, I agree with you on the premise of collectivisation of minority groups into a monolith being bad
[14:24:52] <Sapphirus> What I don't agree with you on, perhaps, is what I think your view of sexual minorities.
[14:24:53] <Kill-Animals> Zoidberg: Its my religion bro. 
[14:24:57] <Sapphirus> is*
[14:25:05] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the etiology of "pedofilia" , pedo is cold and Philia is love
[14:25:19] <MootPoot> is there a different punishment/law for fucking a 14 y/o vs a 7 y/o aside from the judge/jury's subjectivity in how sever the judgement is
[14:25:23] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Well go ahead. Make your case. 
[14:25:32] <amigojapan> Etimology*
[14:25:39] <Zoidberg> your religion is opposing LGBTQ communities Kill-Animals?
[14:25:52] <Kill-Animals> Zoidberg: Yes absolutely. 
[14:25:55] <MootPoot> I am pro gay dudes - I can have more chances at cute girls all to my self
[14:25:58] <MootPoot> why not
[14:26:06] <MootPoot> more dudes should be gay
[14:26:13] <Kill-Animals> MootPoot: lol unironically true
[14:26:26] <Kill-Animals> I read that same take on /r9k/ yesterday 
[14:26:47] <Sapphirus> Zoidberg, that acronym is such a crapshoot. Each minority group has individual issues and treating them like a monolith is patronising. 
[14:26:53] <Zoidberg> oh well, I have nothing to say
[14:27:01] <Sapphirus> It's a far-left hijacking of minority rights movements. imho

[14:28:04] <MootPoot> Zoidberg: are you pro catgirl
[14:28:05] <Sapphirus> If there's one thing that's made me stay more in the closet, it's how overly politicised sexual orientations and whatnot have become.
[14:28:10] <Sapphirus> Leave the damn politics out of it, is all I ask.
[14:28:19] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: did I show you a picture of what I ate last night?
[14:28:22] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: I didn't even know there's a thing called maggi sauce.
[14:28:24] <Sapphirus> That's all I've asked for nearly the last decade.
[14:28:43] <amigojapan> Zoidberg it's a Mexican sauce
[14:28:43] <Zoidberg> hell yes MootPoot 
[14:28:49] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: I need politicized sex so I can finally get approval for catgirls
[14:28:53] <MootPoot> smh
[14:29:01] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: cat ears for everyone!
[14:29:26] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Its complicated actually. Extremely complicated. To bring a more sophisticated point on LGBTQ+, is that their ideology of acceptence is extremely dangerous to themselves. A lot of mentally ill people who have no identity or community end up finding LGBTQ+, and going with it strictly because it is not going to be judgemental to their own eccentricities. Over time, those who come to dominate that community, are 
[14:29:40] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: is it like pasta, noodle sauce or more like Worcestershire sauce?
[14:29:42] <Kill-Animals> the mentally ill, giving LGBTQ perhaps a worse name for it than it deserves.
[14:30:01] <MootPoot> If humans had cat ears we would probably need to have the super flexible kind to be any use Zoidberg  - like the wild cat ears ( not domestic ) which are a lot taller
[14:30:09] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, most of us just want to be left alone. I don't associate with most of that nonsense despite being a sexual minority myself.
[14:30:18] <MootPoot> since we already have left/right and front/back hearing from our normal ears
[14:30:23] <MootPoot> we would need above and directed
[14:30:41] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: I was thinking of more like Inuyasha's cat ears kind
[14:30:41] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: yeah similar to worcestershire sauce. We put both of those sauces in pizza 
[14:30:41] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: You willing to give up the gay pride parades and teaching it to children? 
[14:31:06] <Zoidberg> I see amigojapan 
[14:31:18] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, I was never for any of that crap.
[14:31:21] <MootPoot> Kill-Animals: I do have to ask you something here " A lot of mentally ill people who have no identity or community end up finding LGBTQ+, "  <-- this sounds like a problem with overall society, not LGBTQ
[14:31:41] <Sapphirus> Like I said earlier, far-left ideologues have captured that movement.
[14:31:44] <MootPoot> like, society failed them , so why blame a niche subset for it
[14:31:53] <Sapphirus> People who proclaim to speak on behalf of us are full of it. speak to the individuals themselves, not people claiming to speak on behalf of an entire group identity.
[14:32:20] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Then maybe youd be fine in a place like russia. Keeping it private without making it a spectical is the minimum level of tolerance I am willing to accept.
[14:32:27] <Sapphirus> People pushing to teach children age inappropriate material should be ashamed of themselves.
[14:32:34] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: I can speak on behalf of all HDD consumers when I say seagate should fuck off with their SMR crap
[14:33:10] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, Western Digital tried to sell people SMR drives without labeling them.
[14:33:13] <Sapphirus> That's even more abomindable.
[14:33:20] <MootPoot> seagate did that to me
[14:33:33] <MootPoot> its 8tb units I bought 4 or 5 of 
[14:33:38] <Sapphirus> wow that's bad
[14:33:39] <MootPoot> are not explicitly denoted 
[14:33:42] <MootPoot> as SMR
[14:33:49] <Kill-Animals> MootPoot: Not all aspects of society are "big tent", or "Accepting", although that is the general trend. But despite the trend, "Chrischan" is a sporkesperson for LGBTQ+, and their aint nothing you can do about it.
[14:34:19] <Zoidberg> MootPoot: WD is doing the same shit, beware!

[14:36:07] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: I do think its kind of bluff though. There is a class of people who feign outrage and saying the left is going to far, to placate the rightwing conservatives.  Dave Rubin is one, but he is one of the sickest human being alive, now that he has son in a surrogat mother coming his way
[14:36:54] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: which ones are their helium ones - I run those crappy SMR units, and those EXOS enterprise units
[14:37:17] <Kill-Animals> Hes going to raise a child, with two fathers, depriving that child of a mother; its sick. He should be kicked out of the country and sent to israel.
[14:37:22] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, the 18tb ones you have are helium.
[14:37:26] <MootPoot> ach
[14:37:35] <MootPoot> well, I only have two and they were the same price/GB as the SMR units
[14:37:49] <MootPoot> they are backed up 1:1 so I should be fine
[14:37:56] <Sapphirus> 10tb WD Red+s I got are air drives, so
[14:38:10] <Sapphirus> Only difference between WD Red+ and WD Red Pro seems to be warranty
[14:38:33] <Sapphirus> Dealing with their warranty claims department is a hell I don't want to bother with.
[14:39:00] <MootPoot> I learned a lesson on not to buy seasonic - their units tend to be fine but
[14:39:09] <MootPoot> they have only one place in the US for a RMA center

[14:40:26] <Sapphirus> Kill-Animals, whilst I respect your right to believe that, I think what you are suggesting there is rather abhorrent. 
[14:40:46] <MootPoot> Kill-Animals: I'm not sure if "MootPoot: Not all aspects of society are "big tent", or "Accepting", although that is the general trend. But despite the trend, "Chrischan" is a sporkesperson for LGBTQ+, and their aint nothing you can do about it." this was meant for me or Sapphirus

[14:42:18] <MootPoot> yeah, well at least there are 2-3 alternatives
[14:42:25] <Sapphirus> However, that doesn't mean your comments there aren't insensitive af, Kill-Animals.
[14:42:33] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Phats the other thing. Only offensive to lgbtq+, is the only consideration ever made. 
[14:43:02] <Sapphirus> Yeah, but if you're just being offensive and saying outlandish things on purpose to an illicit a response, are you any better than the people you oppose?

[14:46:01] <Sapphirus> These lines you crossed stretch far beyond that realm.
[14:46:11] <Sapphirus> Opinions you expressed have nothing to do with your religion.
[14:46:22] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Are you religious?
[14:46:46] <Sapphirus> I was raised catholic (am no longer), and you don't represent the faith with the opinions you express.
[14:47:03] <MootPoot> I mean, as long as he's not really going out and attacking people or anything....
[14:47:14] <MootPoot> Kill-Animals: thighdeology
[14:47:15] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Okay so if you are not religious, why are you dictating what religious values ought to be?
[14:47:21] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, he's attacking public figures, but not anyone here as directly as he could be.

[14:48:51] <Kill-Animals> Hey I love everyone. Gay people too. 
[14:49:03] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, I'm sure there's people who'd find that offensive. Edgy for the sake of being so is just distasteful, but I'm not personally offended by what he said.

[14:55:12] * Kill-Animals looks it up
[14:55:15] <Sapphirus> An Isekai that isn't total shit.
[14:55:31] <Sapphirus> Last one I watched was a disaster and it had me laughing because of how crap it was.
[14:55:46] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: its not a isekai tho
[14:55:58] <MootPoot> MC never gets TP'ed to the fantasy world
[14:55:58] <Sapphirus> is it not
[14:56:04] <Sapphirus> he did
[14:56:07] <Kill-Animals> "When Kazuya Souma is unexpectedly transported to another world, he knows the people expect a hero. But Souma's idea of heroism is more practical than most—he wants to rebuild the flagging economy of the new land he's found himself in! Betrothed to the princess and abruptly planted on the throne, this realist hero must gather talented people to help him get the country back on its feet—not through war, or adventure, but 
[14:56:07] <Kill-Animals> with administrative reform!"
[14:56:09] <MootPoot> just normal fantasy
[14:56:11] <MootPoot> wait
[14:56:13] <MootPoot> is this the same show

[14:56:27] <MootPoot> oh nvm I was thinking of a different one
[14:56:28] <Kill-Animals> off the cuff, it does sound pretty generic for an isekai
[14:57:01] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Besides konosuba, whats the best isekai in your opinion?

[14:58:36] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: the only 2 isekai that have held my interest are re:zero and mushoku tensei 
[14:58:38] <Kill-Animals> Sapphirus: Shield hero was pretty good. Re zero technically is, but I oppose it on principle
[14:58:40] <Sapphirus> Slime is another good one, but can have bad pacing at times.
[14:58:46] <MootPoot> this one
[14:58:47] <MootPoot> Tensai Ouji no Akaji Kokka Saisei Jutsu
[14:58:52] <MootPoot> its the same deal pretty much
[14:58:58] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: and konosuba
[14:58:59] <MootPoot> fantasy politics
[14:59:03] <Sapphirus> Mushoku Tensei is probably the best isekai I ever watched.
[14:59:17] <ketchupicecream> konosuba is pretty good cause it doesn't take itself seriusly
[14:59:20] <Sapphirus> But my personal favourite, would be Shield Hero.
[14:59:38] <Kill-Animals> "Hai to Gensou no Grimgar" I think is the best. What I love about it is that it has a weak MC, and it doesnt give him plot armor unlike SAO

[15:01:10] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I dont think it will though
[15:01:25] <MootPoot> it gives the writer such a easy blank slate to work off of
[15:01:30] <MootPoot> I think it'll remain as a constant
[15:01:35] <Kill-Animals> MootPoot: Yep. Its like saying, "When comedy craze runs out"
[15:01:55] <amigojapan> MootPoot: eventually there will be a different craze. People thought the school anime craze would never end too 
[15:02:02] <Kill-Animals> There is probably some greek play which can be considered the first isekai

[15:05:45] <amigojapan> No Kill-Animals it was literally aimed at adults 
[15:05:47] <Kill-Animals> I kind of think that a seinen shouldnt be able to hold the interest of a child.
[15:05:58] <ketchupicecream>  my dad would sit beside me whenever shinchan came on
[15:06:00] <Kill-Animals> hmmm

[15:07:05] <Kill-Animals> amigojapan: Is it good?
[15:07:25] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: Kill-Animals : what makes something "seinen"is just that it is published in a Seinen magazine
[15:07:25] <Kill-Animals> according to my app, "Dokonjou Gaeru" is the first seinen series
[15:07:49] <amigojapan> Kill-Animals: it's funny. Yes
[15:08:06] <ketchupicecream> amigojapan: oh. didn't know that
[15:08:21] <Kill-Animals> Oh this. I don't know if I'd watch it if I didnt have kids though. 
[15:08:48] <ketchupicecream> Kill-Animals: yeah they are more like shorts 
[15:08:55] <ketchupicecream> like tom and jerry
[15:08:59] <Kill-Animals> To me its like how sesame street has adult jokes and humor that would go way over a childs head; It doesnt make sesame street a seinen though
[15:09:23] <Kill-Animals> well I'll make sure to give it a shot
[15:09:30] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: yeah and same goes for shounen. If they publish it in a shounen magazine then it is classified shounen. That is why most yandereing animes ended up being "shounen"
[15:09:56] <mixfix41> clown taken down
[15:10:08] <ketchupicecream> amigojapan: i see. you cleared up my confusion about AoT being shonen
[15:10:15] <Kill-Animals> Lupin III is seinen

[15:10:57] <ketchupicecream> adults
[15:10:59] <DunceCotus> who is the determinant
[15:11:05] <DunceCotus> which adults?
[15:11:06] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: shounen usually sells better so the writers want to publish as shounen of they can
[15:11:19] <amigojapan> If they can
[15:12:16] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: there are no real laws about what can't be in a shounen 
[15:12:32] <beaky> does fujo yaoi also sell well
[15:12:50] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: it's not like "pg-13", not a law

[15:13:39] <ketchupicecream> amigojapan: makes sense. It just falls on the publisher to determine that?
[15:14:58] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: it has more to do with which target audience they think they can sell more copies to than any moral grounds 
[15:15:39] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: and adults also buy shounen jump for example
[15:16:08] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: there is no rule against kids buying seinen either
[15:16:35] <ketchupicecream> i find ratings to be nothing more than a consolation to parents
[15:16:47] <ketchupicecream> kids will find stuff
[15:18:03] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: this really has nothing to do with parents
[15:18:26] <ketchupicecream> i was getting a virtual lap dance in los santos playing gta as an 11 year old
[15:18:39] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: in Japan parents don't try to hide much stuff except for porn from children
[15:18:47] <ketchupicecream> amigojapan: why bother with ratings then
[15:19:16] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: it's not a rating, that's what I am trying to say
[15:19:26] <ketchupicecream> oh i understand that
[15:19:43] <amigojapan> Ok
[15:20:50] <DunceCotus> who wasn't getting virtual lap dances at that age
[15:20:59] <ketchupicecream> ikr
[15:21:19] <DunceCotus> as we get older that sorta thing becomes old hat, and then we become sorta disgusted by it
[15:21:34] <ketchupicecream> yeah and ruin it for the ones next in line
[15:21:38] <DunceCotus> there's a certain tenuous relation between lewd and disgust

[16:46:42] <mexen> I start learning/using Django next week BTW
[16:46:51] <amigojapan> Nice
[16:46:54] <mexen> Or should I go Flask, amigojapan 
[16:47:12] <MootPoot> I started django for a bit
[16:47:18] <MootPoot> my main problem is that I'm just entry level 
[16:47:22] <MootPoot> so idk WHERE to go 
[16:47:24] <mexen> I now know enough Python to use a framework is the point. Same with JS. I start React next week.
[16:47:38] <MootPoot> I wish I would just get a job then I can put my time into getting better at that
[16:47:42] <amigojapan> mexen: I have not used either. Have a tiny amount of experience with ruby on rails
[16:48:18] <MootPoot> mexen: my plan is to do this https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-portfolio-with-react-featuring-cool-animations/ and then show it and bullshit my way through
[16:48:19] <ImoutoBot> [title] Create a Portfolio with React featuring Cool Animations
[16:48:28] <MootPoot> the tutorial is super recent, only 2 days ago 
[16:48:32] <MootPoot> so it should be ok
[16:48:32] <mexen> I skipped Ruby and went to Elixir/Phoenix. Fun stuff. I have always been fascinated with at least exploring Rails
[16:48:32] <MootPoot> :3
[16:48:43] <mexen> Oh yes that tutorial popped up in my feed
[16:49:08] <MootPoot> the problem with react for me is that I never really got in my head how it works
[16:49:14] <MootPoot> its just....idk
[16:49:35] <mexen> Spend a day on vanilla JS
[16:49:36] <MootPoot> react reacts..sure but getting variables in and out and making stuff trigger is just 
[16:49:37] <MootPoot> idk
[16:49:53] <MootPoot> mexen: I've done enough normal JS to be able to fuck my way through
[16:49:55] <amigojapan> MootPoot: react is batshir crazy. At least not as much as the Android SDK 
[16:50:30] <mexen> MootPoot: then brute force that React tutorial my man, I normally don't give such advice but yeah
[16:50:36] <mexen> Pass your interview
[16:50:44] <mexen> You will learn it proper afterwards hahaha
[16:50:48] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I think it's angular I am using now, that's good
[16:51:35] <mexen> amigojapan: do I need Typescript for Angular?
[16:51:50] <amigojapan> No mexen it's optional
[16:52:07] <mexen> Coolness!
[16:52:19] <MootPoot> I've dabbled in JS and react enough times where I dont think I'm completely new
[16:52:29] <MootPoot> maybe its just a matter of doing it
[16:52:29] <MootPoot> idk
[16:52:33] <mexen> Why would I need to learn Typescript? Other than types
[16:52:38] <amigojapan> mexen: I am not absolutely sure it is angular I am using now. But I am using one that makes sense
[16:52:53] <MootPoot> tbh I'm convinced the path I want to go is python or .NET and focus on writing APIs
[16:52:58] <MootPoot> rather then front end
[16:53:03] <MootPoot> but work is work for now
[16:53:27] <mexen> MootPoot: you're ready, you probably just needed to build something with the knowledge you had. All the best buddy.
[16:53:29] <amigojapan> mexen: typescript also helps keep code the same by other coders
[16:53:42] <mexen> amigojapan: gotcha
[16:54:07] <mexen> MootPoot: you can always transition over time once you get the job
[16:55:39] <amigojapan> mexen: and don't forget that every type error you catch is one less potential runtime error you are avoiding
[16:55:57] <MootPoot> one less line of JS in the world is one less future error
[16:56:03] <MootPoot> :p

[16:57:14] <MootPoot> like python or even VB ( ew ) 
[16:57:30] <MootPoot> why do web languages have to be interpeted
[16:57:37] <MootPoot> I don't like it
[16:58:12] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the only options back in the day were js ActiveX and Java applets, ActiveX was Windows only.
[16:58:22] <MootPoot> all of this JS stuff is basically "how fast can we fill up your system RAM"
[16:58:26] <amigojapan> Js is better than Java

[16:59:50] <amigojapan> Js is compiled
[17:00:16] <MootPoot> ?
[17:00:24] <MootPoot> the v8 just interpets it

[17:01:46] *** Quits: ninjabuffet (~ninjabuff@user/ninjabuffet) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[17:02:04] <MootPoot> so somehow they still compile down to byte code - C#, JS and Python but for some reason C# is just leagues faster 
[17:02:14] <MootPoot> now if we can replace JS with C#
[17:02:36] * MootPoot watches amigojapan writhe in disgust at the mention of C#
[17:03:16] <amigojapan> MootPoot: "In order to obtain speed, V8 translates JavaScript code into more efficient machine code instead of using an interpreter. It compiles JavaScript code into machine code at execution by implementing a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler like a lot of modern JavaScript engines do such as SpiderMonkey or Rhino (Mozilla).Aug 21, 2017
[17:03:31] * MootPoot vomits
[17:03:39] <amigojapan> It says machine code
[17:03:50] <MootPoot> so it compiles...but its still slow as shit

[17:04:11] <amigojapan> It's faster than before
[17:04:36] <MootPoot> can we get Aurora_v_kosmose to replace JS in the browser with C

[17:10:50] <MootPoot> chromium works better then FF for me
[17:10:52] <Zoidberg> why not use a language that can be compiled to js?
[17:10:57] <mixfix41> chromium plays discord nitro
[17:11:03] <MootPoot> FF tends to just turn into a pile of shit over the months
[17:11:10] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: we need to support Firefox they are running out of users and are just about the only competition against Chrome
[17:11:15] <MootPoot> then every time I just go back to chromium
[17:11:45] <ketchupicecream> amigojapan: yeah and there's this sick vim extension on firefox 
[17:11:53] <MootPoot> that and firefox for android sucks ass
[17:12:43] <ketchupicecream> firefox android has extensions tho

[17:13:56] <MootPoot> I use vivaldi
[17:14:02] <ketchupicecream> ah 
[17:14:03] <MootPoot> it has the best tab handling
[17:14:13] <ketchupicecream> yeah
[17:14:20] <ketchupicecream> looked sick the last time i checked
[17:14:22] <MootPoot> if firefox fixed their tab handling and their slowdown issues I would go back

[17:46:59] <Sapphirus> Resulting climax knocks you out and is so pleasurable, isekaijin
[17:47:27] <isekaijin> So you want to prevent yourself from climaxing as punishment?
[17:47:32] <isekaijin> Punishment for what, though?
[17:48:04] <Sadale> Sapphirus, I see. In the end you're still cumming.
[17:48:27] <Sapphirus> isekaijin, that's not the purpose, no. I'm actually cancelling my climax right at the time that I actually am having what you could technically consider (maybe?) multiple orgasms.
[17:48:53] <amigojapan> Konbanwa isekaijinkun
[17:48:58] <isekaijin> That's way too deep and intellectually sophisticated for me.

[17:49:19] <amigojapan> Hi isekaijin 
[17:49:37] <Sadale> Sapphirus, is there a substaintial amount of cum coming out tho? If so that'd be a ruined orgasm
[17:49:46] <Sadale> Sapphirus, And yes I could have multiple ruined orgasms as well
[17:50:06] <Sapphirus> Not a significant amount, but there is cum, yes, and I continue going hard afterwards.
[17:50:23] <Sapphirus> Completely bypassing the refactory period
[17:50:49] <Sapphirus> You just need to listen to your body and learn how to control it.
[17:51:10] <Sadale> ahh..
[17:51:54] <Sapphirus> It actually makes the resulting orgasm infinitely more pleasurable.
[17:52:00] <Sapphirus> (final one)
[17:52:09] <ketchupicecream> stopping before the point of no return is damn hard
[17:52:57] <Sapphirus> For sure, but once you figure out the critical timing and control over the muscles involved, you can successfully stop it and keep going.
[17:53:17] <Sadale> Sapphirus, i see. how much cum get out while you're edging tho? loke a few drops?
[17:53:22] <Sadale> like*
[17:53:56] <Sapphirus> Yeah, it's nothing significant, but it's like buffing the final climax such a huge amount.

[17:56:40] <Sadale> ketchupicecream, ah. I can restrain upon hearing the warning sound from my device if I'm building one :3

[17:56:59] <ketchupicecream> Sadale: sign me up for one!
[17:57:22] <Sapphirus> Sadale, it would be worth it to try and figure out how to do it yourself.
[17:58:05] <Sadale> there's an existing design called "nogasm". With enough time, I do have the capability to build one.

[18:01:45] <Zoidberg> Sadale, I didn't know you're into dildotronics
[18:02:17] <Sadale> My first step would be make a device that'd warn me of upcoming orgasm. And the second step would be integrate it with, says, a stroker or a vibrator and turn it into an edging device :3
[18:02:51] <Sapphirus> How would the device even determine such a thing?
[18:02:53] <Sapphirus> lol

[18:03:27] <Sapphirus> Sadale, interesting.. lol
[18:03:33] <Zoidberg> Sadale: I think the orgasm could be determined by heart beat or pulse rate right?
[18:03:34] <ketchupicecream> Sadale needs to do some research
[18:03:49] <Sadale> Sapphirus, right before you cum your back-end would contract.
[18:04:12] <Sapphirus> That makes sense.
[18:04:19] <Sadale> Zoidberg, not sure if that'd be reliable. The only successful way for detection that I've found online is detect butt contraction.
[18:04:30] <ketchupicecream> woah
[18:04:34] <Sadale> Zoidberg, I could test it out if I have the time tho, which I don't :P
[18:04:47] <Sadale> Now, the next problem for me would be find a way to hide those sex toys :/
[18:05:05] <Sapphirus> If you know that much, you might be able to figure out how to preempt it without a toy.
[18:05:11] <Sadale> An inflatable butt plug is bulky. :-( The electronics is fine tho because no one'd know what it's used for :P
[18:05:17] <Zoidberg> ah yeah, that happens, I've seen that in porn too Sadale 
[18:05:28] <Sadale> Zoidberg, what happens?
[18:05:32] <Sapphirus> Although it's a kind've thing that I think you can only learn through individual experience.
[18:05:37] <Sadale> Zoidberg, contraction?

[18:09:58] <Sadale> Sapphirus, I actually find it easier to edge with just my hands. Using any sex toy would make it much easier to go over.
[18:10:04] <Sapphirus> One of my best sessions had me almost high like I had smoked marijuana afterwards for about an hour.
[18:10:14] <Zoidberg> and blood pressure
[18:10:23] <Sadale> Sapphirus, at least that stays true for onahole and butt toy. 
[18:10:29] <Sadale> A cock ring would probably do the opposite effect tho
[18:10:45] <Sadale> Sapphirus, wow. I'm jealous.
[18:11:01] <Sadale> Sapphirus, I'm wondering what'd happen if I did the same as what you're doing, except that I'm not cumming. :3
[18:11:24] <Zoidberg> Sadale: I am doing a bit of google search, the stage before orgasm is called plateau stage 
[18:11:32] <Sapphirus> Only way to get that insanity is to let the bubble burst, Sadale.
[18:11:45] <Sapphirus> Took years of practice to get this far.

[18:13:00] <Sadale> LOL
[18:13:17] <Sadale> Zoidberg, ah. surfing's much more difficult than edging.
[18:13:56] <Sadale> Zoidberg, I also find it very difficult to edge with onahole attached because just having the onahole covering my cock would provide stimulation even if I'm not stroking. If I'm just using my hands, I could just put my hands away.
[18:14:00] <Sadale> Like in no time

[18:15:41] <Zoidberg> Sadale: women don't have that refractrory period after orgasm
[18:15:53] <Sadale> Sapphirus, yours is probably just edging. I think the common terms for "surfing" in wikipedia is "riding the edge".
[18:15:58] <Sadale> Zoidberg, cheater
[18:16:08] <Sapphirus> Well that's what I'm doing, sadale.

[18:16:35] <Sapphirus> yes.

[18:16:49] <bxgelsan> :D
[18:16:51] <bxgelsan> lol
[18:16:53] <Zoidberg> so what conclusion do you came to Sadale? how to tell someone is about to reach climax?
[18:17:10] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: s/C/a Lisp/
[18:17:15] <Zoidberg> Sadale: and how to detect that?
[18:17:21] <Sadale> Zoidberg, conclusion? I still need to test that. But I believe that the butt contraction detection would work.
[18:17:38] <bxgelsan> what if they are holding in a fart
[18:17:41] <Sadale> Zoidberg, There's a strong contraction right before you cum. And I can personally confirm that because I feel it.
[18:17:41] <bxgelsan> and its inaccurate
[18:17:43] <bxgelsan> :P
[18:18:03] <Zoidberg> Sadale: I am thinking of a sensor that could detect the anal clinch, change in pressure sort of thing..
[18:18:11] <Sapphirus> Sadale, what I learned is that you have to stroke out of sync with your body.
[18:18:40] <Zoidberg> Sadale: I don't think contraction happens with everyone, not sure
[18:18:48] <Sadale> Zoidberg, again, it's inflatable butt plug plus pressure sensing electronics fit into the tube of the butt plug.
[18:19:16] <Zoidberg> nice
[18:19:21] <Zoidberg> that would do the trick
[18:19:28] <Sadale> I'd first get the pressure sensor to work. Then do a fapping session while doing pressure data collection. After that, I will review the data and see if I could find any sign of contraction.
[18:19:51] <Sadale> Then I'll make a warning device based on the data collected and test it out
[18:20:18] <Sadale> Then I'll integrate a vibrator or a stroker into the device so that it'll keep edging me without allowing me to cum :3
[18:20:42] <Sapphirus> You kind've have to learn how to desync your stroking from the beat of your heart almost.
[18:20:43] <Sadale> Let's hope that it'd work out :32
[18:20:54] <Sadale> Sapphirus, :O
[18:21:06] <Sadale> Sapphirus, what did you mean? so it has something to do with heartbeat? :O

[18:22:02] <Zoidberg> Sadale: theoretically that has to work
[18:22:05] <Sapphirus> You have to stroke out of phase to with a slower refined pace to stroke down the edge.
[18:22:06] <Sadale> Sapphirus, I mean, is the arousal generation of each stroke even correlated with heartbeat?

[18:24:32] <justanotheruser> hi Sadale, how is china
[18:24:34] <Sapphirus> Sadale, the key is to keep it out-of-phase so you aren't stimulating and rather plateauing the climax.
[18:25:02] <Sapphirus> You're stroking and maintaining stimulation, but it is desynchronised. That's the best way I can put it into words.

[18:46:53] <bxgelsan> one of the things I read when I got out was the 48 laws of power. Solid book despite its association with mal intent.
[18:46:57] <amigojapan> nyanpasu o/ Zoidberg
[18:47:08] <Zoidberg> amigojapan, what are you having for dinner today?
[18:47:11] <bxgelsan> studied the damn thing up and down for months
[18:47:38] <bxgelsan> helped me make sense of people
[18:47:42] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: I already had a burrito adna  protein bar
[18:48:30] <Zoidberg> nice amigojapan, does the burrito contain rice there?
[18:48:48] <bxgelsan> rice must be.
[18:49:05] <amigojapan> no Zoidberg, it contains chilly con carne and cheese only
[18:49:42] <Zoidberg> that's nice amigojapan, they have rice here
[18:49:49] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: I don't like it
[18:50:02] <bxgelsan> gonna go study, laters
[18:50:16] <amigojapan> I see
[18:51:08] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: burrito is form north mexico it is hard ot get in Mexico city, people mainly eat corn tortillas there
[18:51:22] <bxgelsan> Sadale: pm before i go
[18:51:46] <Zoidberg> yeah, I know that one amigojapan 
[18:52:11] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: from the other channel, shovel told me
[18:52:27] <amigojapan> I see
[18:54:13] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: most "mexican food" internationally is based on the American interpretation of Mexican food
[18:54:50] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: damn
[18:55:17] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: on that note, there's a new tacobell place opened up near my home
[18:55:30] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: I think that is usually the cause for most forein food, even getting the actual ingredients can be hard

[18:56:06] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: is it cheap or expensive? in Japan it is super expensive
[18:56:21] <amigojapan> in america it is very cheap
[18:56:52] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: I am thinking it is because most people eat mexican food in 'merica than in Mexico.
[18:57:23] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: average, not cheap or expensive
[18:57:45] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: in america taco bell is one of the cheapest places you can buy food
[18:57:59] <amigojapan> cheaper than mcdonnalds
[18:58:37] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: if I remember correctly 1 taco was 1 dollar when I lived there
[18:59:27] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: in Japan it is more   like 20 dollars for a decent meal at taco bell
[19:00:16] <Zoidberg> wow
[19:00:21] <amigojapan> yup
[19:00:53] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: the tacos here are small and one has to eat at least a couple of them to have proper meal
[19:00:53] <amigojapan> I only went there once
[19:01:01] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: I heard that's same everywhere
[19:01:27] <amigojapan> right, 2 to 4 tacos at least depending on hwo hungry you are
[19:03:09] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: if we compare like that then it's costlier than any other fast food 
[19:03:36] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: Americans cultivate a lot of corn btw
[19:03:56] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: their sugar in coke is also from corn right?
[19:05:01] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: but in mexican street food,10 tacos probably cost less than 2 dollars (last time I went)
[19:05:42] <amigojapan> and taste better too
[19:05:42] <Zoidberg> I don't think it'd be same now amigojapan 
[19:06:02] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: I am talkinng abotu 11 years ago, last time I went
[19:06:25] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: but the peso keeps on devaluating, so in dollars it is probably still cheap
[19:06:53] <Zoidberg> yeah, I vaguely remember amigojapan. You also have have a taco with pineapple right?
[19:07:15] <amigojapan> yes Zoidberg, tacos al pastor, those are my favorite ones

[20:32:37] <ButterNoodle> thats such shit :|

[20:32:46] <Fenderbassist> tbh

[20:33:26] <ButterNoodle> to bad u cant pick and choose
[20:33:58] <Fenderbassist> I'll be Fonzie on Happy Days in the 70s voting No-amundo until I figure out the defendant was on an English bike with a left hand throttle and thus innocent of the eye witness testimony
[20:34:12] <Fenderbassist> if you ever saw that one
[20:34:19] <ButterNoodle> yea
[20:34:21] <Fenderbassist> yeah it is too bad
[20:34:23] <ButterNoodle> u know
[20:34:29] <Fenderbassist> but it's a civil duty, like voting
[20:34:37] <Fenderbassist> so we have to deal with what's presented
[20:34:45] <ButterNoodle> with all the video surveillance.. it should be ez this day and age

[20:35:14] <Fenderbassist> and yet there seems to be varying degrees of reliance on such

[22:27:35] <Nanobot> I've been summoned for jury duty. The courthouse is out of town, basically in the middle of nowhere. They pay $15/day, plus one-way gas mileage. There will be a lunch break, but no lunch provided and no eateries nearby. I also hear the chairs are uncomfortable, and everyone is cramped together (I guess I'm finally getting covid). They also strongly emphasize that this is our civic duty and it's wrong to try to weasel out of it. If that's such a concern, 
[22:27:35] <Nanobot> then maybe the accommodations should be better.
[22:28:54] <Nanobot> Oh, I forgot, this is Republican territory, so it's okay for our society to crumble as long as taxes are low.
[22:29:42] <ButterNoodle> its only low if ur poor
[22:29:58] <Nanobot> No, it's low all around.
[22:29:59] <Zoidberg> only one way? so they don't care how you return?
[22:30:05] <Nanobot> Zoidberg: Correct
[22:30:27] <ButterNoodle> well thats one way of keeping politicians from lining their pockets with ur hard earned dollars
[22:30:39] <Nanobot> Taxes in the U.S. are way too low, and I'm saying that as someone who's flirting with the top tax bracket.
[22:30:40] <Zoidberg> 15 usd for a day? even minimum wage per hour is more than that

[22:32:32] <Cryowolf> if its a state that allows weed
[22:32:37] <Cryowolf> and its not a federal court
[22:32:43] <ButterNoodle> public intoxication is a crime tho
[22:32:52] <Cryowolf> not everywhere
[22:32:57] <Fenderbassist> they can just choose to assume that he drove drunk
[22:32:59] <ButterNoodle> its the USA
[22:33:00] <Fenderbassist> and slam him with a DUI
[22:33:19] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, Sweden is far far worse so no :p
[22:33:21] <ButterNoodle> our criminal justice system gets wet for that stuff
[22:33:39] <Fenderbassist> I know of a guy that drove a car down a dirt road, got stuck in a pothole, broke the axle, walked to a bar, called a tow truck, had a beer while waiting, and the cops decided he had driven drunk
[22:33:40] <Cryowolf> if the state has legalized it and your intoxication isn't causing disorder
[22:33:46] <Fenderbassist> and charged him successfully with DUI
[22:33:46] <Cryowolf> there's no crime being commited
[22:33:59] <ButterNoodle> happens every day
[22:34:02] <ButterNoodle> twice on sundays
[22:34:08] <Nanobot> I won't try to get dismissed. I'll just hope my group number gets dismissed. It's a pretty low number, though, so I think I'm likely to be called.

I was supposed to attach an emergency lamp to a specific emergency phone module that I've been told is installed there... Well, that wasn't the case and I couldn't find the actual one, so I went into the cabin
[22:49:17] <vegii>  and tested the emergency bell button. No reaction.

[22:52:30] <Zoidberg> what's the jury duty experience is like? 
[22:52:55] <Zoidberg> to be part of decision maker to put some bad person in jail
[22:53:01] <Zoidberg> or an innocent out of prisons
[22:53:13] <emmeka> I am told it is tedious and generally of a nature that will make you want to find the button that ends all human life and press it very hard
[22:53:45] <vegii> ButterNoodle: There was a different module installed there, hidden inside the lamp fixture... and it didn't work because that gentle opening and closing of the junction box made the relevant wires fall out of a screw terminal block. No ferrule, several stranded wires in a single terminal and they've loosened over time so they fell out very easily. Use ferrules, fuckwits!
[22:53:58] <Zoidberg> ah
[22:55:44] <emmeka> Zoidberg the thing with a jury trial is the jury's decision must be unanimous. When a jury doesn't agree about a verdict, they are ordered to go back and talk it over again and again and again until, usually, somebody gets annoyed/bored/tired enough to agree with the rest of the herd.
[22:55:59] <emmeka> so you're basically strongly encouraged to agree with what everyone else thinks
[22:56:43] <emmeka> if a jury fails to find a verdict, a mistrial is declared, but this also results in the judge admonishing the jury for having failed their civic duty and none of them getting paid

[22:57:59] <emmeka> because they failed to do jury duty
[22:58:02] <Zoidberg> that's totally unfair
[22:58:12] <Zoidberg> they tried
[22:58:22] <emmeka> yeah well, welcome to the court system
[22:58:40] <Zoidberg> then they should take majority opinion
[22:58:44] <emmeka> Zoidberg tbf, they usually just order the jury to go back and continue deliberating
[22:58:58] <emmeka> an actual hung jury resulting in a mistrial is very rare.

[23:33:09] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: do you think freenode was legitemately taken over by Andrew from PIA?
[23:33:28] <justanotheruser> seems dubious whether there was the legal right to transfer
[23:33:31] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: idk, but his side of the story seems more plausible considering Libera enabling the takeover of #anime on this network
[23:33:59] <luke-jr> if Libera did to freenode, what this channel did to #anime, then freenode is the lesser evil
[23:34:00] <justanotheruser> didn't freenode enable the takeover of #anime on freenode as well?
[23:34:03] <luke-jr> no
[23:34:10] *** Joins: rez (rez@user/rez)
[23:34:11] <justanotheruser> didn't freenode deregister everyone?
[23:34:15] <luke-jr> freenode #anime remains as it always has
[23:34:32] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: freenode switched to a new services software, and didn't migrate the db
[23:34:39] <Zoidberg> it's just irc luke-jr, only a chat channel of anime
[23:34:45] <Zoidberg> let it go mate
[23:35:06] <Aeres> heya Zoidberg 
[23:35:11] <isekaijin> Wait, luke-jr *isn't* founder of this channel?
[23:35:20] <justanotheruser> oh, 10:20 -keitwo(~kei@freenode/staff/kei)- [Global Notice 3/3] When you connect, register your nickname and your channel and get started. It's a new world. We're so happy to welcome you and the millions of others. We will be posting more information in the coming days on our website and twitter. Otherwise, see you on the other side!
[23:35:24] <isekaijin> What the hell.
[23:35:26] <luke-jr> isekaijin: Libera enabled Nanobot to do a hostile takeover here
[23:35:31] <luke-jr> so the real #anime is on freenode
[23:35:35] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: you didn't need to re-register?
[23:35:38] <Zoidberg> yo Aeres 
[23:35:49] <justanotheruser> that staff message seemed to suggest you did
[23:36:05] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: I'm not sure what you're getting at
[23:36:43] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: did you have to re-obtain your +F in #anime by registering it with chanserv on freenode?

[23:37:07] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: everyone had to re-register after the services software changed
[23:37:37] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: so freenode also *enabled* the takeover of #anime, but you prevented it by re-registering 
[23:37:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If irc had better search features, more channels with similar topics could compete without namespacing being such an annoyance.
[23:37:50] <justanotheruser> Aurora_v_kosmose: you mean alis?
[23:38:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> justanotheruser: It's not integrated with clients because it's a bot that just happens to be common.
[23:38:17] <Zoidberg> wow, are you pretending to be dumb justanotheruser?
[23:38:43] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: no, that's nonsense
[23:39:10] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: Libera staff actively assisted Nanobot take over this channel
[23:39:21] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: so you're saying it would have been impossible for me to snipe the channel if I tried following the reset?
[23:39:36] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: yes, freenode staff would have helped recover it
[23:39:45] <justanotheruser> Ah, now I understand the difference
[23:39:59] <justanotheruser> staff helped on freenode, but staff reassigned on libera
[23:40:18] <justanotheruser> unrelated to the database
[23:42:15] <Zoidberg> not reassigned, more like new leader, isn't it?
[23:42:39] <Zoidberg> it's not all the anime networks in every irc belong to nanobot or luke
[23:42:49] <justanotheruser> all I don't understand is why libera staff refused +F
[23:42:50] <luke-jr> more like stolen
[23:43:04] <justanotheruser> for luke-jr 
[23:43:14] <justanotheruser> because nanobot registered it first?
[23:43:15] <luke-jr> Zoidberg: Libera caused chaos on freenode to steal the userbase for their new network, passing it off as a continuation of freenode
[23:43:18] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: he didn't
[23:43:26] <justanotheruser> then what
[23:43:53] <Nanobot> To clarify: On FreeNode, both #anime and ##anime existed. luke-jr did not own ##anime. This is ##anime. The staff of FreeNode's ##anime and #anime came together, and the consensus was to merge into Libera's ##anime. luke-jr didn't agree with that, but everyone else did.
[23:44:01] <Bco1981> !later tell TsundereNoises https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o58e-FAjveA
[23:44:02] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: he convinced Libera to reassign the chnanel to him
[23:44:14] <Zoidberg> luke-jr: why do you want the +F so badly?
[23:44:22] <justanotheruser> ah this is #anime
[23:44:24] <justanotheruser> ##anime*
[23:44:24] <luke-jr> Nanobot: you went behind my back you mean
[23:44:27] <Zoidberg> luke-jr: it's been more than a year now,
[23:44:32] <justanotheruser> seems libera should open #anime and assign it to luke-jr 
[23:44:53] <justanotheruser> Nanobot: who is everyone?
[23:45:13] <Nanobot> luke-jr: We discussed it with you, and you kept throwing up ultimatums that nobody else would agree to.
[23:45:22] <luke-jr> Nanobot: liar
[23:45:34] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: rename Yandere to Anime. Register it as an open source project. Request a single # from libera staff for the open source Anime project
[23:45:37] <Nanobot> justanotheruser: The entire operational staff of both FreeNode's #anime and FreeNode's ##anime.

[23:51:32] <luke-jr> it's also a *public* chat room
[23:51:34] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: I'd trust a network of volunteers than a private enterprise like PIA, so I'm not risking it
[23:51:39] <SaladChampion> justanotheruser> didn't freenode enable the takeover of #anime on freenode as well? <- It's interesting, actually; #anime and ##anime used to both exist at the same time, with different owners at odds with one another.  But in Libera.chat, it's since been resolved.
[23:51:41] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: and our PMs are private chat
[23:51:47] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: freenode is still a network of volunteers :P
[23:51:57] * SaladChampion peers behind ButterNoodle's kimochis, what's he hidin'?
[23:52:05] <luke-jr> SaladChampion: it's not resolved. #anime was just forced to stay on freenode
[23:52:08] <justanotheruser> network of volunteers with final authority given to a private company
[23:52:17] <SaladChampion> luke-jr: oh, I see.
[23:52:21] <SaladChampion> and then Freenode itself collapsed.
[23:52:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> As a rule of thumb, corpos will fuck anyone over for cash.

[23:53:18] <luke-jr> #anime still active, regular chat
[23:53:23] <SaladChampion> ok
[23:53:29] <luke-jr> SaladChampion: no, that's more Libera propaganda/lies
[23:53:32] <SaladChampion> ok
[23:53:52] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: why did they buy freenode if they had no interest in involvement?
[23:54:04] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: to support the free software community?
[23:54:22] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: they can do that through donations without the network
[23:54:29] <justanotheruser> without buying the network*
[23:54:33] <luke-jr> justanotheruser: it's not like PIA is involved in the network operations
[23:54:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Where's freenode's documentation even at anymore?
[23:54:38] <emmeka> justanotheruser the story is this: all ops of both old freenode ##anime and #anime agreed to merge the channels during the libera migration, for peace and harmony etc. We agreed on Nanobot as +F. We registered ##anime was registered by us for this purpose, #anime was claimed by some rando so we got staffers to have it redirect to here.
[23:54:40] <ButterNoodle> its really just luke-jr and BillyZane talking.. I've been meaning to come over and drop my conspiracy theories on the death of america and the collapse of the US dollar

[23:55:58] <justanotheruser> luke-jr: hi, I'm in libera #anime
[23:56:13] <luke-jr> there is no libera #anime
[23:56:15] <ButterNoodle> did the redirect go away justanotheruser?
[23:56:34] <justanotheruser> no, it redirects here
[23:56:40] <ButterNoodle> oh ok
[23:57:05] <emmeka> justanotheruser so, we did all of this without asking luke. When we told luke, he insisted that he was the rightful and sole +F of Freenode #anime and thus the rightful +F on Libera, as #anime is a FOSS project registered to him. Libera staffers did not accept this argument.
[23:57:31] <emmeka> this resulted in very long, tedious arguments where we attempted to come up with something that would make him happy
[23:57:45] <justanotheruser> lol you guys tried to make luke-jr compromise?
[23:57:47] <emmeka> including proposing immunity from bans and voice.
[23:57:51] <justanotheruser> you're funny emmeka

[23:59:09] <justanotheruser> luke-jr never used his op powers anyways, he even asked me to unban him when he was fully capable of unbanning himself
[23:59:31] <justanotheruser> I think he just wants the +F by his name
[23:59:47] <emmeka> justanotheruser but to clarify: no, luke never had +F on libera ##anime or #anime. #anime was squatted by some random and then the channel was nuked by Libera staff, and ##anime was controlled by us from the very beginning.
