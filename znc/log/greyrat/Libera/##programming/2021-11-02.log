[00:00:26] <rustyshackleford> good for a "yep, got it"
[00:00:28] <pyzozord> and that some people sometimes use that pointing up emojis to suggest a middle finger
[00:00:34] <rustyshackleford> also effective in a passive aggressive way

[04:22:08] <flakland> last time i used it everything was baked into some crappy db
[04:22:28] <mannu> android has a file system with file paths
[04:22:41] <flakland> since when?
[04:22:47] <flakland> damn its been a while i'll admit
[04:23:03] <mannu> since android was created
[04:23:24] <flakland> on a scale from 1-10 how certain are you
[04:24:07] <mannu> man
[04:24:12] <smallville7123> 10
[04:24:24] <smallville7123> Android is based heavily on Linux
[04:24:38] <flakland> is that why you say 10
[04:24:42] <InPhase> flakland: You can use a terminal on android.  It doesn't work great, but you can do it.
[04:24:43] <smallville7123> tho is also a heavily modified version of linux
[04:24:44] <flakland> because it's based on linux?
[04:24:52] <InPhase> flakland: There's cd and everything.
[04:24:52] <smallville7123> yes
[04:24:54] <mannu> termux is fine
[04:25:00] <mannu> i use it often
[04:25:05] <flakland> if i saeve a file on android it gets saved to a file path?
[04:25:10] <mannu> even got ohmyzsh on it for the hipster points
[04:25:17] <smallville7123> it uses a modified version of linux kernel
[04:25:20] <InPhase> flakland: There are also file browser apps.
[04:25:39] <InPhase> flakland: And you can mount your phone remotely and browse its storage.
[04:25:45] <mannu> on my tablet i even got a keyboard
[04:25:54] <smallville7123> tho android is not linux like mac os is also not linux even though both are based on linux
[04:26:05] <mannu> android is linux
[04:26:07] <flakland> so in the context of JUCE framework, JUCE is installing a file to the android filesystem?
[04:26:08] <mannu> osx is bsd
[04:26:11] <InPhase> smallville7123: How sure of you are that from 1 to 10?
[04:26:20] <flakland> this is what you imagine is happening?
[04:26:23] <InPhase> s/of you are/are you of/
[04:27:32] <flakland> i mean i can r/w to a tar file and claim i'm using a file too i guess
[04:27:39] <smallville7123> not entirely as it for example does not contain /tmp nor /run and most of its apps are JVM zygote but i would say 70% is linux and 30% is android specific stuff such as zygote, android JVM, /data, /system, ect

[04:32:49] <flakland> so its not a real path or it is a ral file path
[04:33:01] <smallville7123> tho those are probably related to specific user-profiles somehow
[04:33:21] <Guest80> it seems many languages differentiate between declaration and initialization for variables but for arrays when you declare the like int[] arr; that looks like a declaration to me but actually creates memory on stack so its instantiation without initialization. is there no pure declaration for arrays?
[04:33:36] <Guest80> how do you just declare one without using any memory

[04:34:42] <InPhase> smallville7123: Linus used MINIX as an OS to write Linux, but Linux does not strictly descend from Minix because it had a proprietary license at the time.  Minix was a unix-like, but independently written.  Linux is also in the end independently written, except that some BSD code has made its way into the Linux kernel, as this is a compatible license direction.
[04:35:00] <Guest80> jtgd: I'm trying to compare across languages but let's say your standard C, C++, Java and C# 
[04:35:45] <jtgd> the answer would be different depending on the language
[04:36:05] <oldlaptop> modern BSD kernels even have some linux drm (Direct Rendering Manager, not the other expansion) stuff in them, much of which is X11-licensed (incredibly enough the responsible parties wound up choosing to keep the license when that all moved into kernel space)
[04:36:11] <smallville7123> eg in psuedo, data/owner/data, data/guest/data, data/user_1/data, and so on    (this is true for /data/user/0 which directly corresponds to the owner uid 0 (tho not to be confused to root uid 0), and in some, /data/user/92 for samsung Dual-Messenger apps which install a second copy of an application visible for the current user (probably something like UID + 92 or something, eg UID 1 Dual-Messenger UID

[10:43:58] <Guest35> Hello, I am having trouble understanding how to setup a server ssh key for github deployment via ansible. Should I generate a "new" keypair on my vps and add it to gpg keys in github? This solution however seems a bit weird since now I am manually creating a keypir on one target server and manually copying it to github, what if I had 100 servers
[10:43:58] <Guest35> how would I then scale this process?

[12:20:50] <TheGuestMovie> checkers incompatible with each other? Did Python typing get Linuxed, with multiple half-assed incompatible rival solutions fragmenting the community? Or is there a standard way a library's typings are defined, and then all these tools consume the same definition file?

[12:56:09] <pyzozord> I might be wrong though, double check that
[12:56:55] <pyzozord> casey/jon kind of use the paywall as a filter for more dedicated people so they don't need to interact with trolls
[12:58:10] <pyzozord> but also their definition of a troll is much broader, I think they could potentially consider me a troll just for asking questions that were asked before or that are too trivial and answers are available on the internet

[13:15:58] <mrig> Yes I have that.

[13:46:10] <pyzozord> (not like I am of big help with cs subjects anyway, but I'd like to explore that problem more)
[13:46:50] <beaky> it involves pointers heavily
[13:46:55] <Decker> not sure it's a problem :) 
[13:47:10] <mrig> Oh awesome, bug nailed to a cork board!
[13:47:15] <mrig> :D
[13:47:39] <Decker> if you make a schedule for a tree and lose that it's a tree why was it a tree?  
[13:48:04] <Decker> oh  -because it's a static dataset that can't itself represent cycles

[13:50:25] <mrig> It was freed up by moving the starting position of the player, I think that the start position of the glyph was off screen with the default code, which was giving a false address into the virtual memory tile map, and thus reading with false offsets.

[13:51:39] <mrig> The code can be updated on the fly, and in the video it had not been loaded whilst the code was being changed, it was being done hot so to speak, the issue was not apparent because the thing had not been restarted.

[13:55:31] <pyzozord> nice progress. Yeah I'm quite sure you come out the other end a competent video game developer
[13:55:42] <mrig> The virtual memory, that is currently vaguely sparsely populated is such a cool thing, iv already got uses for this in my main project; It it has been said that it is not a proper sparely populated memory yet, that it will get better :D
[13:56:01] <mrig> Oh I'm not doing it for video games, want to visualise data.
[13:56:20] <pyzozord> well that's almost the same thing
[13:56:23] <mrig> and have other things that I want the graphic skills for.
[13:56:30] <mrig> Yes it is, very cool stuff.
[13:57:19] <mrig> Though that said, I might not be able to resist trying to build a flight sim probably a space thing.

[13:58:44] <mrig> I was thinking about the sparsely populated memory map, for data visualisation, you can step through dimensions and the data remains positionally correct, without using the entire space.
[13:58:54] <mrig> Awesome stuff.
[14:00:10] <mrig> managing to nail two vids a day some days, will see were it goes; Getting just onto the math and rendering code now though, which should be really cool.
[14:02:01] <mrig> Ah there is a bug here still in the dimension or level changing part of the code, have the courage to bit it now though, as there is progress :)

[18:06:57] <SrPx> Is there any learn-programming course that is purely based on solving tasks? It presents a problem (possibly visual), you write a small script, solve it, next, repeat. It doesn't try to "teach" with words, it just gives you the tasks for a non-stop practice. Nothing other than that. Example: "Here is a list of numbers. Write a function that returns the largest" / "Here is a chess board. Here are some functions: (...). Write a script that 
[18:06:57] <SrPx> moves the knight to the king." / "Here is a cat and a ball. Here are some functions: (...). Write a script that makes the cat chase the ball."

[19:49:26] <InPhase> servytor: Writer's block comes from a variety of things like choice paralysis, or fear of failure.  Most of them are resolved by two steps:  1) Separate out the worry by setting it aside, and give yourself a separate mental environment (for which it is helpful to obtain a separate physical environment, like go sit somewhere else with paper and a clipboard) free of self-judgment, and brain storm 
[19:49:32] <InPhase> ideas.  You want to select from ideas without worrying about them being right, but just let all the possibly good ideas stream out and jot down short reminder notes of them.  Use this to come up with ideas of what to implement, and to come up with architectures for how to implement.  2) The "get started" trick, where once you minimize or close all distractions and force yourself to sit down at a 
[19:49:38] <InPhase> computer and start typing a little bit, it is more likely that your auto-pilot kicks in and you keep on typing out code for a long stretch.  Refer back to your brainstormed architecture notes when you lose track of what to do next.  Switch between these steps as needed.

[20:12:39] <Hmph100> I am new to ER diagrams and I have a simple question about the best way to model the following:
[20:12:40] <Hmph100> One or more inhabitants (weak entity) is assigned to be the leader of a group (strong entity). A group consists of 1 to many inhabitants. An inhabitant cannot be a member of more than one group.
[20:12:40] <Hmph100> What I have done:
[20:12:41] <Hmph100> group (strong entity) --- contains (identifying) --- inhabitant (weak entity) [total participation on both sides & 1:N]
[20:12:41] <Hmph100> Then with the same entities, I have another relationship that looks like this:
[20:12:42] <Hmph100> group --- Leader_Group (non-identifying) --- Inhabitant [total participation on the side of Group & 1:N]
[20:12:42] <Hmph100> Does this make sense? I am struggling to find a better way to capture the information.

[21:02:43] <[itchyjunk]> wouldn't max size be either language dependent or artichetecture dependent?

[21:03:15] <[itchyjunk]> You have to store it somewhere, I guess the size of the storage contains how big it can be?
[21:03:24] <mrig> droid3 you can make arrays that point to regions of data too.
[21:03:35] <droid3> well arrays seem to be more restricted because they are dependent/restricted by being index by integer
[21:03:39] <mrig> each region can be size_t if you want.

[21:18:37] <[itchyjunk]> like a 32 bit computer has a max size it can hold? I think I am too confused now
[21:18:57] <CalimeroTeknik> because a 64-bit processor can only address 16 billion billion gibabytes
[21:19:07] <droid3> ya so size_t is nothing more then indexing arrays using longs instead of integers so you get SIZE_MAX = 18446744073709551615 max limits for index
[21:19:30] <CalimeroTeknik> in a 32-bit computer, only 4GB of memory can be addressed *at all*

[21:45:58] <droid3> its probably better to have this error thrown for programming languages because it indicates that your using all the physical memory that your process can allocate for your datastructure
[21:46:52] <droid3> but is there away to tell the OS to use unlimited virtual memory for a given datastructure in a give process.
[21:47:14] <ShiftyLogic> You have to have the swap space allocated for it.

[22:09:42] <droid3> so the implementation of stack,queue ,list,set ,...etc that we implement in software have no real max limit in software but the OS memory limits for the process the software runs these data structures in. Is usually the restriction
[22:10:15] <CalimeroTeknik> no, the physical memory is the limit (unless for some stupid reason you still run 32bit kernels)
[22:10:26] <droid3> and as paging is set usually once and used by all process you get a memory out error

[22:11:37] <CalimeroTeknik> that exists
[22:11:38] <Decker> there's overhead of doing overly complex things that benefit only a few use cases
