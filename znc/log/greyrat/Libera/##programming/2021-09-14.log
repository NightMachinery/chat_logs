[00:03:36] <alycidyne> [itchyjunk]: well C's void is *theoretically* a unit type because a function returning void returns control, whereas a function returning an empty type would actually not return
[00:03:42] <alycidyne> InPhase: thought that looool
[00:03:56] <[itchyjunk]> oh
[00:04:03] <[itchyjunk]> so empty type is theoretical?

[00:04:27] <[itchyjunk]> does this type exist?
[00:04:42] <alycidyne> [itchyjunk]: more precisely, an empty type represents a "divergent" computation, i.e. one which never "returns"

[00:27:08] <Izem> user51: code is preceded with :
[00:27:56] <InPhase> [itchyjunk]: The OO model is all about creating instances that have those properties.  So it is reasonable to have an instance of the empty type in this model.
[00:28:33] <[itchyjunk]> but the def of empty type seems to say it has no elements

[00:32:35] <pavonia> In Haskell you can define empty types, though all of those types still have undefined/bottom as a value
[00:32:53] <mrig> type is a philosophical construct that needs to be accepted more so than understood.
[00:33:13] <mrig> Least that is how I see it.
[00:33:23] <[itchyjunk]> oh the empty types will end up having value?
[00:33:34] <NetMatic4> how can it have a value?
[00:33:37] <[itchyjunk]> I assume empty type is hard to implement as is with strict definition
[00:33:39] <pavonia> It's not a real value
[00:34:10] <mrig> if you receive for empty searches from a database, how else are you going to quantify them?
[00:34:18] <mrig> four
[00:34:20] <pavonia> If you could define a class in Java that has no instances, you would still have null as a value of that type
[00:34:26] * mrig is playing golf :D
[00:35:10] <[itchyjunk]> okay I understand the still having null as the value
[00:35:23] <[itchyjunk]> so the empty type has a null value?
[00:35:27] <[itchyjunk]> hmm idk
[00:36:05] <mrig> as are number actually, but we learn them so young that the belief in them becomes so defined in our thought that the convincing ourselves no longer needs any work.

[00:36:38] <NetMatic4> if you're parsing a file, do you skip whitespace or does it mean somehing?
[00:36:40] <[itchyjunk]> since it involves a set of instruction
[00:36:55] <[itchyjunk]> white space is definitely something definate
[00:37:08] <[itchyjunk]> it probably has some very specific encoding and such

[04:28:22] <ricky_clarkson> Hi, I'm looking for existing frameworks/libs, regardless of the language, that would help when you have a request (REST, gRPC, whatever) that needs to trigger some tasks in a way that can be configured to be sync or async without massive code change, and do retries in the background if something fails. Let's say the request is to trigger something important like reserving inventory then 
[04:28:28] <ricky_clarkson> shipping it - if we crash before shipping then we'd like retries to kick in without the original caller having to do retries.
[04:29:02] <ricky_clarkson> Anything you can point at that I could get ideas from or validate my design against? I have something in the works but being able to point at something existing would be handy.

[05:15:00] <droid3> The question tonight is 1) when using BigDecimal( "324824.4242" , mymathcontext );
[05:15:33] <droid3> when i get the precision it says 10 and when i get the scale() it says 4.
[05:16:04] <oldlaptop> struct bigreal { bigint n; bigint divisor; // look I did it };
[05:16:06] <droid3> Which is fine if its being defined from the string representation but i thought the mymathcontext would override this?

[05:16:17] <Common-Lisp> oldlaptop: nice 
[05:16:40] <droid3> As mymathcontext is set to 1000 with a RoundingMode.DOWN.

[06:58:04] *** Joins: freakazoid343 (~matt@2603:9000:cf0f:80e3:d8e1:9267:d4e3:a072)
[06:58:29] <PlanckWalk> If you say you want to *ROUND* to *AT MOST* 1000 digits, then why would you expect all those trailing zeroes?
[06:58:53] <droid3> O so then the main question is if i am given a number say 538382.999 is there away to tell the printing function to print an additional 100 trailing zeros 538382.99900000000...000
[06:59:07] <PlanckWalk> If the decimal you started with had fewer digits, then the rounding does nothing.
[07:00:01] <PlanckWalk> If you like, think of it as two operations: first make a decimal from your string (with given scale to represent it exactly), then round it according to your MathContext.
[07:00:05] <droid3> i know i know its not for efficiency or what you want to do majority wise but it should beable to add as many trailing zeros you want to the number. Including it be nice if you could add trialing zeros to the left most digits as well if your working with p-adic type stuff :)
[07:00:22] <PlanckWalk> You can specify how many digits you want with one of the other constructors
[07:00:48] <droid3> So i guess all this talk is more about padding zeros to the right and left of your exact number.

[07:04:34] <PlanckWalk> It doesn't specify zeroes to the left, ever.
[07:05:30] <droid3> ok but how where you thinking about specifying them for the right
[07:06:31] <droid3> I thinking the most common used constructors would be a String value of the number (what i say is most common way to construct a BigDecimal) Or constructing it from a BigInteger with a scale.

[07:10:18] <droid3> Anyway PlanckWalk any constructor you choose to use i dont see how you can provide trailing zeros / padding zeros to the left of the number.
[07:10:44] <droid3> I think that has to do with the printing function itself not the internal representation with in BigDecimal itself.
[07:11:24] <droid3> It makes sense to have BigDecimal only represent the exact value in its most shortest digit form. Which it seems to do well.

[07:15:13] <droid3> I know i know most case you wont want to but some times its nice for display to print trailing zeros for comparing numbers.

[07:15:24] *** Joins: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo)
[07:16:07] <droid3> Not a big deal though one could always concat on a string of zeros to his liking once you toStrings it
[07:16:51] <droid3> Ok enough with my rambling thank you very much PlanckWalk for the talk you cleared up my issue or any issue i have with BigDecimal stuff. 
[07:16:56] <vdamewood> How does rounding work with floating point numbers?
[07:17:37] <vdamewood> I ran this in node, and all of the odd values rounded to the nearest multiple of 4 rather than down, which is what I expected. -- for (i = 0; i <= 20; i++) { console.log(9007199254740992+i); }
[07:17:41] <droid3> vdamewood you have standards like single precision float types or double precision double type in your programming langauge
[07:18:10] <NetMatic4> 8bit exponent, 23bit fraction
[07:18:30] <droid3> these standards are set by the IEEE on how much exponent bits , 1 bit for negative/positive indicating , and the rest for the significand 
[07:19:08] <droid3>  from that the hardware circuits of the fpu in your cpu  with the cpu instructions for the fpu control arithmetic 
[07:19:10] * enyc meows ... ooo acive programming channel =) 
[07:19:21] <enyc> sure I had sebody asking after this kind of channel
[07:19:29] <enyc> ... if only I remembered who/where ;p
[07:20:05] <droid3> From all this you can get overflows,underflows ,...etc But when people create arbitrary precision libraries like i am talking about with BigDecimal you get around those flow issues /round off errors at the expensive cost of speed.
[07:21:20] <droid3> So alot of case you want to still use direct fpu and built in data types like float and double for the speed. Yet if your working with heavy duty huge numbers and ridiculous precision you need an arbitrary precision library built more in software. vdamewood
[07:22:44] <vdamewood> droid3: That doesn't answer my question.
[07:22:44] <droid3> Anyway it turns out BigInteger is much easier to understand and build in software then it is for the BigDecimal stuff partly because you got more factors when you move into rationals aka division make things difficult to represent exactly.
[07:23:16] <droid3> what was your question sorry i was giving you the run down on everything and why it is the way it is.
[07:23:22] <vdamewood> I mean, I already know how IEEE floating-point numbers are represented and I've written assembly code for the x87.
[07:23:44] <vdamewood> The question is: "How does rounding work?"
[07:24:37] <arahael> vdamewood: Friction.  Friction causes everything to become round over time.
[07:25:12] <vdamewood> arahael: Not without rotation, then things just become flat.
[07:25:15] <droid3> So then what your issue if its how to build fpu circuits from hardware/transistors then you and me both i still dont know this exactly. I imagine its using ALU like adder circuits , multiplier circuits but with some logic to check exponent , sign bit ..etc

[07:27:08] *** Joins: NetMatic4 (~0x100@32.211.211.39)
[07:27:25] <droid3> The main reason one choose them is in the context/situation your round in.
[07:27:46] <droid3> Some times rounding to the even gives you a better average over all round off error.
[07:28:09] <droid3> But then in certain cases you rather always under round and that can be accomplished by rounding down 
[07:29:04] <droid3> Good question vdamewood hope i answered it for you but over irc its hard to answer without a board and in person sometimes :)
[07:29:48] <droid3> Any case adding on to vdamewood question i am curious in java is there a way to Create for MathContext your Own custom rounding mode function????
[07:30:16] <droid3> PlanckWalk may know this he pretty good with this stuff. But InPhase or somebody else might....?
[07:30:24] <PlanckWalk> No, since MathContext doesn't have any rounding methods.
[07:30:43] <droid3> Ok then RoundingMode enum 
[07:31:07] <PlanckWalk> You can't extend enums, so no
[07:31:40] <droid3> Like somebody create these rounding modes it seems most times they leave a interface or other type of means to construct a custom rounding mode. That would seem like something java would want to do.
[07:32:38] <droid3> But i have to admit most of those rounding modes are the way you want to round anyway in any situation i can thinking of off the top of my head.
[07:32:48] <PlanckWalk> The problem is that other classes (like BigDecimal) do their own rounding based on the specifications in MathContext
[07:33:14] <droid3> But like interface comparable to compare different objects you think they have away to make your own custom rounding methods.
[07:33:28] <PlanckWalk> You can extend BigDecimal I think
[07:34:08] <droid3> Ya or even Number which is more general its a public class that isnt final so ya 
[07:34:41] <PlanckWalk> Well, I was mainly thinking in terms of doing your own rounding on BigDecimal values (that you can then pass to other things that expect a BigDecimal)

[07:36:37] <droid3> anyway not a huge deal like i said its not so commonly ever going to be need.

[07:38:56] <PlanckWalk> Then they extend BigDecimal or whatever other thing they need
[07:39:30] <droid3> Ya i guess extending is the way to go as a work around.
[07:39:36] <PlanckWalk> That's the class that actually does the rounding
[07:40:08] <PlanckWalk> So it's not a work around, it's the class that actually does the function so that where it should be changed.

[15:16:14] <jtgd> If the canvas is infinitely scalable and scrollable then you need to pick a global origin for 0.0,0.0 (x,y) so it may as well be the center of the original blank canvas. Then make every point relative to that. Keep everything floating point until you render and then convert to ints for screen coordinates.

[15:18:27] <jtgd> right
[15:18:55] <jtgd> you just scale all your points and do clipping to the viewport
[15:19:16] <smallville7123> eg it may be passed x1 0, y1 0, x2, 50, y2, 50     or it may be passed x1 50, y1 50, x2 100, y2 100
[15:19:22] *** Quits: Shiva (LordShiva@user/one39dev) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[15:19:50] <akronymus> Basically you'd calculate the absolute position of the elements by `whereTheOriginIsInScreenspace + (scale * relativePositionOfElement)`
[15:19:59] <vdamewood> Hmm... i wonder if CMake has a way to say "if installing normally, put files here, if installing to package, put files there instead.
[15:20:00] <jtgd> but you don't do that until the end, just before you render

[15:21:05] <smallville7123> jtgd: yes, but i need to do this in order to compute the screen coordinates needed to layout nested views
[15:21:25] <akronymus> The object itself has no knowledge of any scaling/absolute position.
[15:21:31] <smallville7123> as well as hitboxes
[15:21:41] <akronymus> That is only really relevant for the drawing routine
[15:21:49] <jtgd> you will need to get the window size from the browser and feed that back
[15:22:03] <smallville7123> eg     scale the resulting drawing position by the upper level size
[15:22:13] <smallville7123> this will be the size of the container that holds this view
[15:22:17] <jtgd> unless you just draw everything and let the browser clip
[15:22:34] <smallville7123> it may be a parent view, or it may be a GL/Vulkan window
[15:23:19] <smallville7123> (in the latter i just obtain the framebuffer size and assume that to be the correct size
[15:24:14] <smallville7123> akronymus: yea
[15:24:28] <pyzozord> there is a difference when parent is another "virtual view" or where parent is an actual gl/vulkan window, those cases should be handeld separately. In the first case you are still operating on relative positions, in the second case you convert to actual pixels

[15:30:52] <Samian> What would your life look like if you performed at your best ever single day?  Let that question sink!
[15:31:03] <smallville7123> eg the GL window draws the top most view's texture to its full screen texture and then draws that to the framebuffer

[15:31:33] <Samian> open gl is annoying to code

[15:33:27] <smallville7123> anything that drawn with pixels will do
[15:33:42] <jtgd> are these parent structures a part of GL, or something you create?
[15:33:44] <smallville7123> or rather, floating point pixels
[15:33:57] <smallville7123> (eg 0.25 is allowed)
[15:34:24] <smallville7123> the parent of a view is just another view
[15:34:37] <smallville7123> or rather a viewgroup, which just extends view
[15:34:56] <jtgd> I would do as I said above, keep all coordinates (for lines, rectangles...) in floats and then convert to draw.
[15:35:18] <jtgd> ok, are these "viewgroups" part of GL, or your app?
[15:35:25] <smallville7123> thats what i am already doing

[16:18:46] <mrig> Could be quite cool, and useful, as a static site building tool, that constructs pages from a database.
[16:19:17] <mrig> The thought being working from an actual terminal.
[16:19:31] <mrig> the output being html is about avoiding browsers.

[16:21:06] <mrig> still pondering C code structure at the moment though.
[16:22:26] <mrig> A GUI toolkit that mirrors a terminal toolkit would be amazing too though.
[16:22:26] <user51> terminal ui is a good way to defeat grep
[16:22:48] <mrig> no longer having continuous lines of text?
[16:22:53] <pyzozord> mrig: mirrors in how it looks or functions or both?
[16:23:01] <mrig> pyzozord: both
[16:23:14] <user51> mrig: in the sense that you can't grep it anymore, even if it's just text
[16:23:14] <mrig> with functionality added afterwards for mice.
[16:23:17] <user51> can your irc client grep?
[16:23:42] <mrig> user51: but if you have a trie of all your text in cache you would not need grep.
[16:25:34] <mrig> mine can but it is broken at the moment, not bothered to investigate why as i've not required it much.
[16:25:59] <mrig> broken or poorly configured, one of the two, likely the latter.

[18:25:46] <smallville7123> Nothing is wrong with goto if it is used properly. The reason it is "taboo" is because in the early days of C, programmers (often coming from an assembly background) would use goto to create incredibly hard-to-understand code.
