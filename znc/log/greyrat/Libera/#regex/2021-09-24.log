[06:27:03] <digitok> yep, it is
[06:27:35] <re101-possum-63> ps.  separately i had to create my own INNERHTML() in vba  to parse webpages for our corporate site which some microsoft programmer took some parsing shortcuts... and didn't handle lots of scenarios where <scripts> could be added to strings... embedded scripts within scripts quoted... et al...  
[06:27:49] <re101-possum-63> and i know... everyone's abandoned IE. anyways... but still...
[06:29:39] <digitok> sounds fun
[06:31:49] <re101-possum-63> nobody to report the exceptions too... life...  guess that's why MS abandoned IE...  but my thought is some junior engineer found a FASTER method to parsing the INNERHTML -- and left out too many edge cases...
[06:33:06] <re101-possum-63> it even gets trickier when you have to respect the VISIBLE vs HIDDEN/display=none/... states inside the dom
[06:33:10] <digitok> yep, nobody cares about ie
[06:34:12] <re101-possum-63> i drifted into automation for a LAYING-UP-till retired job...  but dag gone... QTP/UFT works best with IE... and poorly with Chrome/FF
[06:34:34] <re101-possum-63> SQA
[06:36:10] <re101-possum-63> level of testing currently doesn't require cross-browser support... but my lifeboat of relying on IE to be supported is gonna need some revamping quickly

[15:36:43] <re101-eel-32> Hi, someone can help me please ? 
[15:37:11] <digitok> definitely
[15:38:51] <re101-eel-32> I get the content of a page (with a page.content()) and I do a new RegExp("var prestashop = (.+);", "gm") but it returns 'null' when I do an .exec
[15:39:48] <re101-eel-32> I want the string of the prestashop variable
[15:40:33] <re101-eel-32> but when i do console.log it will return 'null'
[15:40:44] <digitok> do you only expect one match?
[15:41:03] <re101-eel-32> Yeah
[15:41:51] <digitok> how about content.match(/var prestashop = (.*);/)
[15:42:19] <re101-eel-32> I will try this :p
[15:42:57] *** Joins: re101-deer-77 (~re101-dee@nsfw01.netstudio.it)
[15:43:08] <digitok> you can also do content.match(/var prestashop = ([^;]*)/)[1]
[15:43:17] <digitok> which would be the part you want
[15:48:45] <re101-eel-32> your second solution is great but it does not return a string 
[15:49:53] <digitok> hm?
[15:51:02] <re101-eel-32> the result look like this : {"res"} when i console.log it's normal ?
[15:51:22] <re101-eel-32> (res is my good result)
[15:54:10] <digitok> are you sure the value isn't {"res"} ?
[15:54:16] <digitok> console.log("blah\nvar prestashop = res;\nblah".match(/var prestashop = ([^;]*)/)[1]);
[15:54:17] <digitok> res

[18:08:51] <digitok> worst link posting award goes to
[18:09:19] <digitok> add \s* wherever you want to allow spaces
[18:09:25] <Release_> oh sorry heh i used their default copy
[18:09:41] <digitok> or just " *" if you only need to allow normal spaces
[18:09:48] <Release_> i used [a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+[@][a-zA-Z0-9]+[\.][a-zA-Z0-9]{2,3}
[18:10:49] <digitok> i don't think tlds can have numbers
[18:10:58] <Release_> hm ok
[18:11:09] <digitok> is this matching an email as the whole input?
[18:11:13] <digitok> or is there other text around it
[18:11:44] <JohnDoe2> also quick tip: if you place - at the beginning or end of a character class [-...] it will be considered a literal - rather than a range indicator.
[18:12:19] <Release_> not sure what u mean digitok
[18:12:33] <digitok> i mean is the input a single email
[18:12:39] <digitok> or "blah blah e@mail.com blah"
[18:13:11] <Release_> i wanted to get any patern as long as its an email with spaces for example
[18:13:27] <Release_> to avoid getting any text with @ in it
[18:13:28] <digitok> ok so there can be other text before or after it

[18:13:57] <Release_> i wanted to have spaces optional
[18:14:06] <Release_> as some like to evade and such
[18:14:35] <digitok> so right now you aren't allowing - or . in the domain
[18:15:02] <Release_> anything that can be used in an email id like to have in
[18:15:16] <Release_> i assume to get whatsapp is tricky right ?
[18:15:20] <Release_> or even impossible ?
[18:15:28] <digitok> yea well that's quite complex, you're better settling for something that gets most emails :p
[18:15:43] <Release_> ok guess ur right yea
[18:16:02] <Release_> or perhaps split into 2 or 3 regexes
[18:18:12] <digitok> /\b[\w.+-]+\b *@ *\b[a-z\d-]+(?:\b\.\b[a-z\d-]+)*\b *\. *[a-z]{2,63}\b/gi
[18:18:18] <digitok> this should get most
[18:18:58] <digitok> /\b[\w.+-]+\b\s*@\s*\b[a-z\d-]+(?:\b\.\b[a-z\d-]+)*\b\s*\.\s*[a-z]{2,63}\b/gi
[18:19:02] <digitok> might aswell use \s
[18:19:23] <digitok> brb
[18:20:38] <Release_> ok thanks will try that
[18:23:44] <arash> in this regex https://regex101.com/r/Krf24T/1/ why * is included in the result? in the tutorial for positive lookahead it says "Matches a group after the main expression without including it in the result."
[18:24:27] <Release_> hm doesnt seem to work if added to ircd's pcre regex filter
[18:24:33] <Release_> using inspircd
[18:25:36] <arash> i findout.i should use (?<=\*)

[20:11:31] <re101-human-54> I would appreciate the help, thank you.
[20:11:53] <purplex> you can use regex after adding those numbers in your programming language.
[20:12:23] <re101-human-54> Its an OCR

[20:20:04] <re101-human-54> Thank you purplex.
[20:20:50] <purplex> It can evaluate whether 4.00+1.00=5.00 but that's a different case.
[20:21:50] <purplex> It involves matching, but not "producing" a number.
