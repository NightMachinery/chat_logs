[02:05:40] <moose> What do y'all think of those systems that try to further verify a login by sending a text with a link that you have to click and press "authorize" on, and it makes sure you're on the same freaking IP address
[02:05:56] <moose> It's annoying and just as terrible as an SMS auth code
[02:06:52] <xb0o2> I think any system relying on IP addresses for anything is insane.

[02:14:46] <xb0o2> Logging into your account?
[02:17:21] <moose> Yeah
[02:17:25] <moose> Just every day authentication
[02:18:14] <moose> I received a wonderful notification of "Someone has installed a SIM card in a non-network device that matches a device on your account. Please call Verizon immediately if you did not do this."

[02:18:42] <moose> I doubt it, but you never know. Not sure if it's a fake spam thing, so I just called Verizon directly.. on hold. Lovely.

[02:19:41] <xb0o2> I use my YubiKey for everything :>
[02:19:45] <Nasp> Ms have it, and i think google have it as well
[02:19:47] <moose> I also use my YubiKey mostly.
[02:19:50] <Nasp> And then gov authentication app
[02:19:56] <Nasp> But they are removing the push notification feature :/
[02:20:07] <Nasp> I never really use my yubikey
[02:20:10] <moose> I don't like having my password (even if it's in a manager) AND my MFA thing on the phone at the same time.
[02:20:14] <Nasp> No properp front usb to use it
[02:20:21] <Nasp> And it's already obsolete because it's only FIDO 1
[02:20:46] <moose> I have one of those usb-c + lightning ones
[02:20:51] <moose> And regular USB ones
[02:20:55] <moose> I have too many honestly.
[02:20:55] <Nasp> All in one?
[02:21:01] <moose> Yeah they have a usb + lightning for iphone auth
[02:21:03] <xb0o2> I use BitWarden + YubiKey
[02:21:03] <Nasp> Also i could never figure out how to use mine with NFC on my phone
[02:21:04] <moose> usb-c that is
[02:21:11] <moose> Yeah, I never bothered with NFC
[02:21:22] <xb0o2> And a frequently rotated diceware password on bitwarden
[02:21:31] <moose> Nasp: Are you in the apple ecosystem with mobile?
[02:21:34] <moose> or android?
[02:21:40] <Nasp> I haven't enabled two factor on bitwarden yet
[02:21:43] <Nasp> Android
[02:21:49] <moose> https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-5ci/ this is what I use, but I am an Apple nerd
[02:21:56] <moose> So I have my iPhone and my MacBook, I like this little device
[02:22:30] <Nasp> Ohh they made one with lightning now
[02:22:38] <xb0o2> Yerp
[02:22:41] <Nasp> They dont retract?
[02:22:47] <moose> Nah, totally solid state
[02:23:12] <xb0o2> They're pretty solid fwiw, Nasp
[02:23:18] <moose> They are impervious to many things: gas, dust, liquids, and actually funny enough I found out they are pretty resistant to corrosion
[02:23:39] <Nasp> Have they added backup functionality?
[02:23:55] <Nasp> Because it can still be a bit of an issue if you lose or or it breaks
[02:24:10] <xb0o2> No
[02:24:39] <xb0o2> Well, I lie actually
[02:24:57] <xb0o2> If you're using them for regular TOTP etc which the newer ones can do, obviously you can keep a hold of the secret in other places
[02:25:21] <xb0o2> But for proper U2F, no
[02:26:21] <bpmedley> So frustrating.  The commercial library I want just doubled in price.. omg..
[02:27:54] <moose> Nasp: You can back up the key, yes.
[02:28:01] <moose> But it involves some trickery.
[02:28:20] <moose> You have to make a new key on your desktop and then program the hardware with the key in the secondary key slot, then just use the secondary key slot.
[02:28:40] <moose> It's nice actually, you can have a few keys on the device and differentiate them with long vs short presses
[02:28:41] <Nasp> Can they be used for TOTP?
[02:28:44] <moose> Yep.
[02:28:52] <Nasp> Hmm i thought mostly it was just a key verification
[02:29:12] <moose> You have to register the new key of course with the provider somehow.
[02:29:30] <moose> That's usually done at setup or if a corporate environment just enrolled
[02:29:55] <moose> I use my secondary key slot for gov related PIV though
[02:30:57] <Nasp> THought most used FIDO
[02:31:06] <moose> Most what, governments?
[02:31:12] <Nasp> Most sites using yubikeys
[02:31:20] <xb0o2> If they properly support YubiKeys it's FIDO
[02:31:32] <xb0o2> But the modern YubiKeys will also store TOTP secrets
[02:31:33] <moose> For government stuff we use PIV as per NIST SP 800-73
[02:31:50] <moose> But YubiKey supports that spec
[02:32:14] <moose> It's pretty great, PKCS#11 interface right on the thing.
[02:32:40] <Nasp> Never figured out how to transfer stuff to it
[02:32:50] <xb0o2> You mean like TOTP keys?
[02:32:54] <Nasp> Should be possible to use for SSH keys as well
[02:33:00] <Nasp> Anything besides normal FIDO really
[02:33:02] <moose> yubico-piv-tool for SSH and other certs
[02:33:05] <moose> It works great
[02:33:10] <Nasp> Doesn't it also have keyboard emulator for input?
[02:33:14] <xb0o2> Yeah
[02:33:32] <xb0o2> You just plug it in and touch the button in the prompt and it emulates a keyboard and provides the input
[02:33:39] <xb0o2> The button on the device, that is
[02:33:45] <moose> Yes, we've stored malicious scripts for red team stuff as tokens
[02:34:26] <moose> So in environments where you get searched, phones into lockers, etc before going through a man-trap, you can bring your YubiKey of course and it's not an issue. But you can load up bad things on there first :)
[02:35:21] <xb0o2> I mean I'd imagine there are a plethora of FIDO/U2F keys out there
[02:35:28] <xb0o2> YubiKeys are just pretty well made
[02:35:46] <moose> Yeah uhh one other I used was from a large company that does... HSMs and stuff... who was it...
[02:35:48] <xb0o2> And the newer ones having TOTP support is a bonus for me
[02:36:23] <Nasp> How does that work
[02:36:28] <Nasp> Do you have to press the button 7 times then
[02:36:35] <moose> SafeNet, that's who
[02:36:40] <xb0o2> No, you just press it once
[02:36:41] <moose> They make a solid key too
[02:37:17] <Nasp> But dont you have more than one totp?
[02:37:30] <xb0o2> Oh for TOTP you basically have an app
[02:38:04] <Nasp> So you take your Yubikey to your phone to show the TOTPs?
[02:38:22] <moose> No, you just push the button
[02:38:29] <xb0o2> Yeah, the secret resides on the YubiKey that provides the current password to the client
[02:38:41] <xb0o2> Specifically for old fashioned TOTP
[02:39:21] <xb0o2> For proper FIDO/U2F you just press the button at the prompt
[02:39:32] <Nasp> Not sure i get the idea for TOTP if i need my phone to use it
[02:39:39] <Nasp> Then isn't it easier to just have the TOTPs on my phone
[02:40:15] <xb0o2> Well then you're relying on the security of your phone

[10:52:57] <WillPittenger> If I have a generic `delegate`, how can I use reflection to see if a given `System.Reflection.EventInfo` uses that signature?  I found `eventInfoInstance.GetType().UnderlyingSystemType`, but now I need a `System.Type` to compare it with.  But the type the `delegate` was expanded with won't be known until runtime.  I thought I could build it from the `System.Type` for the unexpanded `delegate`, but that's giving me a syntax error.  The
[10:52:57] <WillPittenger> documentation for the `typeof` keyword says `typeof(x<>)` should give me the `System.Type` for `delegate x<a>(a test)`, but it doesn't like that.

[11:08:20] * moose waves
[11:08:39] <_genuser_> moose not much. just saying hi.
[11:08:43] <moose> greets
[11:08:45] <moose> how are you?
[11:09:00] <_genuser_> doing alright, thankfully.
[11:09:06] <_genuser_> looking at hte market today. quite a drop.
[11:13:21] <moose> oh! yes

[11:28:46] <WillPittenger> Well, it's starting to look like the problem might be that my generic `delegate` is inside a generic `class`.  They are different type parameters.
[11:29:45] <WillPittenger> So `class t<g>` contains `delegate void x<a>(a test)`.
[11:30:48] <WillPittenger> In this case, I have a type parameter for `g`.  So `typeof(t<int>.x<>)` is giving me problems.
[11:35:59] <WillPittenger> I'm giving up on it and going a different route.

[22:58:30] <Shariff> I am using efocre 6 with asp.net mvc .. is there a way to sort the dataset upon database retrieval?

[22:59:36] <xb0o2> `.OrderBy` before evaluating the results?
