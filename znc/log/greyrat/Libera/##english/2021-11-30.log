[00:11:12] <blkshp> placeb0: is Baklava Greek?
[00:11:13] <placeb0> it's more of an insult to the person using it than the person that it is directed to
[00:11:20] <placeb0> blkshp: yes

[00:13:45] <placeb0> insulting?
[00:13:53] <blkshp> never mind

[02:02:21] <matt|lib> im a bit unclear on direct and indirect objects
[02:02:29] <matt|lib> google tells me: A direct object answers the question of who(m) or what. ... An indirect object answers the question of to whom, for whom, or for what
[02:02:59] <matt|lib> my book (for another language): tells me "certain verbs which imply indirect objects necessarily require dative, e.g. helfen (to help in german)
[02:03:14] <matt|lib> so if i were to say "i helped the man" the man would be the indirect object and i don't understand why
[02:03:23] <matt|lib> it's a thing that is being acted upon in a direct fashion no?

[03:59:14] <mdogg> "When a schema is created it can be registered for use by producers and customers."  <-- That could be the second sentence since you have already explained that it can be registered.  Or you could say, "...in the aformentioned regisry..."
[04:00:26] <sgt_chuckles> Feel like i used aforementioned in another paragraph, so I'll go with the first sentence thanks.
[04:00:39] <mdogg> Or, "When a schema is created it can be registered as a schema registry which is a data sore that can be used by producers and customers.

[07:12:54] <kurahaupo> sgt_chuckles: the words "to said" can appear in a valid sentence, however that doesn't make them a phrase. I could say "The winning bidder is the one who offers the largest bid. The lot is transferred to said99,99 bidder after payment of their bid." In that case "said bidder" and "to said bidder" are phrases but "to said" is not a phrase. (A valid phrase can be represented by a single node in a parse tree.)
[07:14:09] <CuriosTiger> mdogg: The delicious Prosciutto at 25% off deal is available while supplies last...and says sold out. I guess supplies didn't last. :-(
[07:16:00] <mdogg> CuriosTiger: Here's a tip for when you're at Costco:  If you see an asterick * next to the Costco item number, that means that the item is not scheduled to be purchased again.  So if there is something you like and then item number has a * next to it, but as much as you can because you may not see it again.
[07:16:45] <twb> CuriosTiger: you're in USA right?  Have you got enough space to cure your own?
[07:17:28] <CuriosTiger> mdogg: Good to know. No asterisk on this one, so I'm sure they'll have it in stock again -- but probably for $200 instead of $150.
[07:17:39] <CuriosTiger> twb: I am, and I do. I don't know how, though.
[07:17:54] <mdogg> 14 pounds is a lot to buy at once.
[07:18:11] <CuriosTiger> I mean, I suppose go get some sides of pork, salt them and hang them to dry for 6-12 months.
[07:18:19] <CuriosTiger> but I think there's probably a bit more to it than that.
[07:18:35] <mdogg> I think Serano ham tastes better than Prosciutto anyway.
[07:18:47] <CuriosTiger> mdogg: It is, but once salted and cured, these tend to last pretty much indefinitely as long as they hang in a cool, dry place.
[07:19:08] <CuriosTiger> Costco ships them refrigerated, but that isn't actually necessary.
[07:19:08] <twb> Boris has a doctor sausage recipe that you can do in a home kitchen
[07:19:44] <mdogg> Correct, Serano and Prosciutto are both completely cured.
[07:20:30] <twb> CuriosTiger: salt-cured meat can stlil be eaten by greeblies, so it's generally a good idea to refrigerate or discard the bits they can get at, once you start cutting slices off
[07:20:43] <CuriosTiger> greeblies?
[07:20:45] <twb> at least if you have 40°C days like I do

[17:59:25] <Babar> if one is less correct, the other would be more correct
[17:59:51] <blkshp> Yes, but one cannot be more or less correct. There are no degrees of correct it is just correct or not.
[18:00:15] <blkshp> The latter is correct, the former is not.
[18:00:21] <Babar> if something is 0 correct, and the other is fully correct, the one that is not 0 correct would be more correct than the other
[18:00:29] <blkshp> No no.
[18:00:50] <blkshp> There are, as I say, no degrees of correct. It is a binary state.
[18:01:04] <Babar> even in binary, 1 is "more" than 0
[18:01:32] *** Quits: solveig (sid194105@id-194105.uxbridge.irccloud.com) ()
[18:01:35] <blkshp> But 0 is 0 therefore it is not at all correct.
[18:01:53] <blkshp> for something to be more of something, the first has to be a little of that thing.
[18:01:55] <Babar> thus 1 is more correct
[18:01:58] <Babar> not really
[18:02:04] <blkshp> Yes, really.
[18:02:24] <Babar> I give you two cups, one empty and one with tea, and I ask "which one has more tea?"
[18:02:27] <Babar> the one with tea has more tea
[18:02:38] <Babar> zero is still an amount
[18:02:55] <blkshp> Ok then, I disagree.
[18:02:59] <Babar> ok
[18:03:13] <Babar> are you the guy who suddenly switches to mod mode to threaten people?
[18:03:59] <blkshp> Possibly but not on an opinion. Only if they start being inappropriate.
[18:04:17] <Babar> ok :D
[18:05:24] <blkshp> See people can disagree but if people become a dick about something, I have  a fist to shake (also, whilst we have been discussing it appears that this is a long argument online and some say "more correct" is fine and some don't so I will stand, not corrected but less correct than I thought :D! lol

[18:12:54] <Babar> I don't often have coffee. When I do, I'm up till 4AM
[18:13:49] <blkshp> Though I'm better than I was. No, i saw this rediculous concoction in a local coffee vending machine Costa, like Starbucks but British and not as good, but I tried one, thought it was horrible and then I tried a real one in the coffee shop, 1 Strawberry to 2 vanilla, 4 shots and milk. Lovely.

[19:37:46] <placeb0> we only have the coffee you can buy at super market 
[19:38:12] <blkshp> house is a multi storey single abode, flat is a single story abode in a multiple storey building, apartment, no idea.
[19:39:11] <placeb0> is apartment not something?
[19:39:29] <bin> apartments and flats are the same
[19:39:52] <placeb0> I guess apartment is the American word?
[19:40:05] <bin> yeah
[19:40:32] <pussipupu> placeb0: a coffee shop
[19:40:33] <bin> sometimes apartments can be multiple stories, so they wouldn't be flats; my understanding is flats are always all one-level (and that's how I use the term in the US)
[19:40:46] <bin> e.g. "I wanted a townhouse instead of a flat because I wanted my own stairs"
[19:40:48] <placeb0> so these words have nothing to do with how big a place is?
[19:40:52] <pussipupu> bungalows are houses :p
[19:41:06] <bin> yeah houses are not alwyas multi-story
[19:41:20] <bin> most houses in TX, for example, are ranch-style which are all one level
[19:41:40] <pussipupu> houses are dwellings consisting of whole buildings, though sometimes with shared walls with neighboring houses, as in terraces and semis
[19:42:01] <bin> a house is a standalone unit. A townhouse is like a rowhouse but the difference between townhouses and rowhouses is that rowhouses are always identical and townhouses are not
[19:42:12] <bin> i currently live in a townhouse
[19:43:20] <placeb0> it must be great to not have neighbors
[19:43:54] <bin> idk, I've never lived in a crazy rural area without neighbors
[19:44:25] <placeb0> didn't you just say you leve in a townhouse?
[19:44:30] <bin> yes
[19:44:36] <placeb0> so you don't have neighbors
[19:44:39] <bin> yes i do
[19:44:47] <placeb0> how?
[19:44:51] <bin> because i live in a city
[19:44:59] <bin> and townhouses are rowhouses that are not identical
[19:45:04] <placeb0> I mean you said a house is a single building, right?
[19:45:09] <bin> a townhouse isn't
[19:45:31] <bin> https://www.triplecrowncorp.com/content/uploads/2020/05/5-Whats-a-Townhouse.jpg
[19:45:50] <bin> I only have 1 shares wall though because I'm in an end unit
[19:46:00] <bin> shared*
[19:46:20] <placeb0> well, those are single buildings attached to each other
[19:46:34] <placeb0> you don't really have neighbors
[19:46:57] <placeb0> maybe max two neighbors, but still on a different building
[19:47:28] <kurahaupo> placeb0: How do you define "neighbo(u)r"?
[19:48:04] <kurahaupo> I grew up living in a detached house. Sometimes I spoke with the neighbours over the fence
[19:48:04] <huf> only siamese twins count
[19:48:05] <placeb0> like someone living right next to you and putting on TV/music or speaking loudly
[19:48:40] <kurahaupo> I would certainly count someone in the next house as "living right next to me"
[19:48:58] <placeb0> if you can't hear them it's like they aren't there
