[22:33:37] <artao> minnesota vikings play the green bay packers (american football) starting at 7:20pm local time
[22:33:41] <artao> it's fucking dark by then

[22:34:38] <artao> jesus!!
[22:37:17] <artao> vikings and packers have a huge rivalry spanning more than 50 yrs
[22:37:45] <artao> in the .. 70s? .. they had The Ice Bowl. Even worse weather than today.
[22:37:53] <artao> insane
[22:43:14] <Panther> How Dead Celebrities are Being Recreated as Realistic Holograms - YouTube <-- I had that idea like 25 years ago. You recreate the mannerisms, the pattern of speech, tone of voice, etc... and you can make all new movies with old stars.
[22:43:23] <artao> i wanted pizza so i ate something i have intead to fill the hunger
[22:43:27] <artao> ... but i still want pizza
[22:43:36] * Panther had short rib empanadas.
[22:43:52] <artao> however, like a billion football games just started, so they're likely stupid busy
[22:44:19] <artao> sounds interesting
[22:44:26] <Panther> A billion football games would take more ppl than are on Earth. :(
[22:44:46] <Panther> We would have to include alien teams and players.
[22:44:59] <Panther> Maybe robots, too.
[22:45:40] <artao> hmm
[22:45:58] <artao> Tenet or Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle
