[02:26:16] <Akiva> Hello, all. I have an off-line master key and separate encryption and signing sub-keys per device. I am wondering, when I switch to my offline key to trust imported keys, how do I then sync those trusted changes to my other devices?

[11:48:55] <Akiva> I see this channel is quite active.
[11:51:24] <henk> Akiva: for some questions more than for others
[11:53:44] <Akiva> lol
[11:54:10] <Akiva> henk: Any chance you might be willing to take a crack at mine?
[11:55:25] <Akiva> I have an off-line master key and separate encryption and signing sub-keys per device. I am wondering, when I switch to my offline key to trust imported keys, how do I then sync those trusted changes to my other devices? I've been using this set up for a while but never solved this one. Nor do I see much direct discussion online.
[11:56:30] <henk> Akiva: Iâ€™m not quite certain what you really mean with 'trust'.
[11:57:34] <Akiva> Ah, so, I import your key and set a trust value associated with your key. Let's say `full`. How can I keep all my devices, with their own subkeys and all with the master offline, in sync with this?
[11:57:43] <Akiva> henk: ^ sorry
[11:59:26] <Akiva> henk: Currently, my master is on an external USB drive. I plug it in and use it, since it has the master secret key, and import several other peoples' public keys. I trust them according to my choice. How do I then get this over to all my other online devices? ie. move over to another laptop and import/sync the web of trust and my own choices, etc
[12:02:48] <Akiva> henk: I apologise if I am unclear in my description or if I am lacking in better terminology.
[12:03:01] <henk> --export-ownertrust Iâ€™d guess
[12:03:21] <henk> but I donâ€™t really know, never tried to solve that problem
[12:05:00] <henk> no, itâ€™s ok, you were using the correct terminology AFAICT. Iâ€™m just careful because gnupg/PGP terminology is sometimes really horrible. terms are easily confused, some concepts are really hard to grasp, crypto is hard, people get confused.
[12:05:45] <Akiva> henk: I absolutely agree and understand. I've tried `export-ownertrust`, which, oddly, didn't seem to do anything. You'd think it was exactly what I needed. 
[12:09:50] <henk> hm, interesting â€¦ works for me o_O
[12:10:03] <henk> gpg --export-ownertrust > ownertrust.gpg
[12:13:09] <Akiva> henk: Odd. I have a friend, let's say "Bob". When I first imported his key, it was unknown trust. I change it to full (all of this while using the USB stick with master secret key). I save and export the ownertrust (as you pointed out). When I then move to my subkey setup and import the ownertrust, `Bob` is still unknown. I even tried `--update-trustdb`
[12:15:38] <Akiva> Yeah, just tried agian.
[12:15:46] <Akiva> s/agian/again.
[12:20:09] <henk> is there any content in ownertrust.gpg (or whatever filename you used)?
[12:20:45] <Akiva> Yes, it shows a few key IDs with the trust level with colon delimiters
[12:22:24] <henk> hm, sorry, I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m only guessing and my guesses are only going to get wilder and wilder â€¦ Iâ€™d recommend asking on the ML.
[12:22:56] <henk> or waiting here for a while longer. sometimes there are people around way more knowledgeable than me.
[12:26:06] <Akiva> henk: "ML"?
[12:26:57] <Akiva> henk: Thanks! I feel like your suggestion is all it should take, which is exactly what I'd already tried. I am just feeling a little confused by it all now. I appreciate the help!
[12:28:24] <henk> mailing list
[12:30:04] <Akiva>  Ah, cheers!
[12:32:18] <henk> I think most people donâ€™t really use the WoT â€¦ at least not really consciously o_O are you sure what you want to do is really relevant for your usecase?
[12:32:32] <henk> IOW: whatâ€™s your goal?

[13:43:58] <Akiva> henk: I don't care quite so much about WoT but more about being able to share and sync between all my devices just which public keys I've signed and trusted via my offline master
[13:50:18] <henk> Akiva: 'trust' is only about the WoT, though, AFAIU â€¦ if you have signed and _verified_ a key, just export and import should be enough.

[14:45:34] <gioele> is there a way (in gpg2) to dump the contents of `pubring.gpg` in textual form?
[14:46:22] <bremner> gpg --with-colons --list-keys ?
[14:46:33] <gioele> Not just the signatures, but all (most) of the details in it in a way that matches the internal structures used in it.
[14:48:58] <gioele> (I'm trying to diff two pubring.gpg files; using `diff -u` on their textual representations seems the easiest route.)
[14:59:04] <bremner> I see. what about --dump-packets?
[14:59:45] <bremner> oops. what is that option actually called...
[14:59:54] <gioele> bremner: I don't see a `--dump-packets` in gpg2. Currently I'm experimenting with `gpg2 -a --export | gpg --list-packets --verbose`
[15:00:23] <gioele> now what I need is a way to export the contents of an arbitrary file. Any ideas?
[15:01:06] <bremner> can't you do "gpg --list-packets --verbose foo.gpg" ?
[15:02:50] <gioele> bremner: great! this looks exaclty like what I was looking for.
[15:10:23] <gioele> bremner: thanks, t works as expected for diffing old pubrings.
[15:10:35] <bremner> cool
