[01:30:36] <grobi> possible to install apps eg in docker or just to your ~/home/dir
[01:30:51] <Hydragyrum> you can, however, inspect the scripts in the .deb, and if the source is available, you can reasonably trust that they aren't putting in anything too obviously malicious
[01:31:17] <ilikeyou> i tried to get it installed in a vm, but i was having trouble linking accounts on linux for whatever reason

[01:36:53] <Guest39> also how come there are so few providers of tor based email?
[01:37:05] <Guest39> is it a lot of efforts to host it?
[01:37:31] <Hydragyrum> well for one you need to have a reliably-online tor node to host on
[01:37:35] <Hydragyrum> that takes some work
[01:38:05] <Guest39> you mean not many providers agree to host it?
[01:38:26] <Hydragyrum> then you also accept some risk that a user does something illegal on your platform and you get caught out
[01:38:35] <Guest39> namecheap seems to be tor friendly and it accepts crypto - hence 0 risk
[01:39:03] <ajak> isn't namecheap a registrar, not a host?
[01:39:12] <Guest39> they provide hosting too
[01:39:34] <Hydragyrum> and then you need to essentially advertise your tor email service, which costs you something to run, would you do all that for free?
[01:39:52] <Guest39> well if motivated yes
[01:40:10] <Hydragyrum> also most tor mail isn't in clearnet at all -- no point in registering a clearnet domain for it (no need for namecheap) you just have an onion site
[01:40:13] <Guest39> plus many people want to use such service and may donate a bit ?
[01:40:52] <Guest39> yes
[01:41:24] <Guest39> i was suggesting to use namecheap in case somehow onion site will become deanonimised

[01:44:34] <Guest39> maybe a voice chat on tor and people are scared they can use a voice changer only tor bandwith is not too great for an audio chat
[01:44:56] <ajak> bandwidth probably isn't as much of a problem as latency and reliability

[06:43:48] <GlobalBanksta>  if someone has photos on facebook taken and the police find you dealing drugs having taken a pic with the same camera can the police link those two photos based on esoteric camera identification methods that analyze the photographs in some strange way
[06:44:01] <GlobalBanksta> can they link two jpgs?
[06:44:27] <GlobalBanksta> i see people showing photos of drugs for sale on darkweb and am truly curious
[06:44:46] <GlobalBanksta> like what if the government could match any photos to the source camera
[06:44:57] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[06:45:00] <GlobalBanksta> the noise in the photos might give it away right?
[06:45:33] <Fault> yup definitely
[06:45:39] <ajak> the best answer to these kinds of hypotheticals is "maybe"
[06:46:15] <Fault> http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/research/double.pdf
[06:47:12] <ajak> pdf over http :(
[06:48:01] <Fault> yea that's not great, but hey it's an .edu 🤷
[06:48:09] <ajak> this is very interesting research though!
[06:48:38] <Fault> yeah was surprised & delighted to find that with a quick googling, this is interesting indeed! thanks for the motivation to look it up GlobalBanksta 😄

[13:24:27] <JPT> Yeah, we should keep everything under the covers, so only the good guys (secret service and skilled blackhats) can abuse bugs.
[13:25:17] <JPT> That way, they can keep using those for way longer, so keeping their list of working zero days long enough, they have to spend less money while everyone else does not get patches
[13:25:40] <JPT> Privacy was never meant for everyone
[13:25:46] <JPT> Just for the ones privileged enough
[13:25:48] <Klinda> "less money" what do you mean?

[13:26:26] <JPT> That means that people will patch or adapt their systems, to get rid of that bug.
[13:26:43] <JPT> This means, that secret services and other actors will need "new" bugs to keep doing what they do
[13:27:04] <JPT> Since they usually don't find them all by themselves, the go out to "buy" info about those from other actors.
[13:27:18] <JPT> Publishing bugs as soon as you learn about them destroy this market
[13:27:37] <piou> Klinda: also for attackers having to find a new bug to exploit drastically reduces the profitability of each bug
[13:28:51] <JPT> Imagine there is a new, secret bug in wordpress. Until someone finally figures it out, everybody out there is vulnerable to it, leaving a gigantic attack surface for abuse and more.

[13:34:07] <JPT> To address the script kiddies: Yes, publishing info about a bug without preparing patches for a quick remedy is bad for a short amount of time. But that's better than keeping it secret and unfixed for longer.
[13:34:15] <Jck_true> We also want a barrier as high as possible to finding new bugs and exploits. We make the barrier higher by fixing the known issues...
[13:34:28] <Apachez> qwerty: its not only about getting rid of legacy code and use standardized functions like memory copy instead of doing something on its own but also to get rid of "features" not really needed... the heartbleed was "by design" but beyond stupid to actually be part of the code

[13:38:03] <mats1> 'responsible disclosure' is 100% horseshit
[13:38:24] <JPT> You can mitigate security issue by fencing off vulnerable components or even replacing them with other, more secure implementations.
[13:38:33] <Apachez> qwerty: also note that some of the replacements are meant for embedded systems with small memory footprint, doesnt necessary mean they are a good choice for a high performance server

[13:40:15] <Klinda> I am just a newbie, seeing this movement let me think they are right, maybe cause I like to destroy things, I mean you find a 0 day with hours and hours of time, why can't I enjoy it a bit and publish it for a fix ?

[13:45:47] <mats1> software does exactly what is written on the box, there is no such thing as 'vulnerable' software

[13:46:40] <piou> Klinda: bug bounty is basically companies saying "Hey, rather than risking going to jail by exploiting this bug, why do you say we paid you to disclose it?"
[13:46:43] <Apachez> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damn_Vulnerable_Linux
[13:46:44] <websec> ^ Damn Vulnerable Linux is a discontinued Linux distribution geared toward computer security students. It functioned as a tool for observing and studying vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel and popular user space software.
[13:46:59] <JPT> Quite the opposite. Whatever we do with computers now, we did with physical security back in the days. What do you think a bank looked like 150 years ago?
[13:47:10] <Klinda> piou: if you care about money yes, that's good, but when I was young I was a lamer, so I didn't care about money, but just to say "I am better than you", sort of that, I think everyone started like that

[13:48:34] <Apachez> that s**t was known for more than 12 months before microsoft fixed it in panic because some chinese APT's started to exploit it in public
[13:48:48] <JPT> Buildings are garbage. You can just drive into them with your tank.
[13:49:05] <Apachez> it was like the chinese said "we know that you know that we know so fix this before we will make it an even larger mess than it already is"
[13:49:38] <mats1> software complexity in nontrivial applications are many thousands of magnitudes more complicated than any building
[13:49:45] <JPT> Security is not about the 100% solution. You have a threat model, which contains things you need to protect yourself against. That's where you define that you consider the risk of a tank going into your building not relevant.
[13:49:47] <mats1> absolutely idiotic to compare

[13:50:54] <Jck_true> Apachez: My manager requested that I listened to a podcast on agile development. I managed 3 episodes. It made me sick when they said that you couldn't deliver a plan when you did agile. And management asking for a plan was them not understanding agile.
[13:51:16] <JPT> mats1: The reality is that a secret service would both be capable of entering your building and your computer. But if your threat model is about "preventing those teenage neighbours from stealing your stuff", that's where physical and it-security will come into play.

[13:53:43] <mats1> the academic community doesn't apparently care a whole lot about real security applications, or the formal maths tooling would be muchly improved and available to the common programmer

[13:54:51] <mats1> it is possible to write a protocol that doesn't balloon 1 packet into 10
[13:54:51] <piou> Klinda: At some point you've got to put the risk involved in the equation, and given the high risk then either you profit to make up for it or you don't do it at all. Even if street creds is what you want you can have that just fine legally.
[13:54:56] <JPT> Oh, sorry. I didn't realize we went from discussing security to bashing agile methods for some reason. :D

[17:42:49] <jesopo> i'm looking for a port that did SYN->SYN-ACK->ACK but then offered no layer 7 data
[17:43:18] <jesopo> maybe even layer 6 in this case
[17:43:36] <JPT> Well, if the server does not start talking, it's probably a protocol where the client has to start talking
[17:43:44] <jesopo> indeed. i want to search for that
[17:44:18] <JPT> What's the destination port number? That usually is a good indicator.
[17:44:24] <jesopo> i have an IP that has valid IKE data and has port 80 open but port 80 offered no application layer data. that's a reasonably specific target to find things similar to it
[17:44:50] <jesopo> so, i'd like to be able to search for stuff that has port 80 open with no data on it and relate that to things with the same IKE hash

[17:45:36] <jesopo> could you re-read what I said

[17:46:02] <jesopo> i'll try it again
[17:46:24] <ajak> yes plz, we're too stupid for your galaxy brain
[17:46:31] <jesopo> I have an IP address here. it shows IKE on udp/500. it also shows totally empty response on port 80. i want to search for other IP addresses with this same pattern
[17:47:12] <jesopo> i know what is usually on port 80. the fact that this IP has an empty response on port 80 is relatively unique
[17:47:33] <JPT> If you tcp connect to a webserver on port 80,  you will get silence
[17:47:40] <JPT> because the browser has to start talking
[17:47:44] <jesopo> my man
[17:48:05] <JPT> Did you actually send an http request to see what kind of error page you get?
[17:48:08] <jesopo> shodan does the HTTP protocol and thusly anything that actually answers a HTTP GET will get indexed as not having an empty response
[17:48:22] <JPT> Aaaah, so that's the important thing you didn't mention.
[17:48:29] <JPT> You DID send a request but you got nothing.
[17:48:34] <jesopo> i didn't send anything
[17:48:38] <jesopo> do you know what shodan is?
[17:48:51] <JPT> Perhaps yes.
[17:48:54] <jesopo> do you know about shodan's search expressions?
