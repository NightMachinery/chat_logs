Second pair of wings is reduced and looks like a pair of miniature drumsticks. This pair of wings (known as halters) is used for balancing during the flying process.

[03:11:28] <CableNinja> even if enough places were to open up today to start making chips, they wouldnt be ready for at least a year, and during that time, more orders keep coming in. if things keep going there will eventually be a backlog no matter how much production speed you throw at it

[03:22:26] <CableNinja> takes super pure silicon to make chips. that silicon is made from the same sand we use to make concrete, and we're making concrete way more than feasible. lithography requires water, and a lot of it. places are dried up because of chip production gone too fast. orders are taking longer than normal to arrive at the mfg and from the mfg, because of people not willing to work for shit pay and drive truck, excessive delays in shipping and the 
[03:22:26] <CableNinja> cargo ship fiasco in the canal. demand is super high because of miners and cloud providers scaling extremely fast, as well as the general population tryin to get along. additionally car and appliance manufacturers are using many more chips than before because of all of the electronics features they're adding and 'smart' things. and thats just talking about with the current technologies and not talking about introducing smaller/more

[04:49:16] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: On average, the life cycle of a house fly only lasts for around 30 days, which means they don’t live for long at all.However, in their short lifetime, they manage to accomplish quite a lot. House flies can lay up to 500 eggs in their lifetime which are usually in batches of around 75 to 150. So, although they don’t live long, an infestation can quickly arise through new generations.

[06:07:28] <TurkeyGibby> !flyfact
[06:07:28] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: Thats right, house flies can see behind them and it’s all to do with their amazing eyes! Unlike human beings, house flies have compound eyes. These intricate eyes provided them with nearly a 360-degree field of view, which allows them to see behind themselves. Unlike ours, the eyes of a house fly dont move. Being able to see in all directions allows them to navigate while also being on the lookout for danger.

[07:08:39] <yuken> fritzwastaken, from the legal definition, 40.
[07:08:40] <fritzwastaken> He also used the majority of the east coasts oil in his hair
[07:08:48] <TurkeyGibby> at least half a dozen
[07:09:00] <yuken> From a practical definition, 7.

[09:05:05] <CableNinja> right
[09:05:20] <CableNinja> either way.. either an extension for the socket or a wrench is the solution
[09:05:26] <JollyRgrs> ^^
[09:05:32] <yuken> JollyRgrs, well, a 3/4" socket head, and something to get it 8" into a crevice.
[09:05:41] <CableNinja> they make extensions..
[09:05:49] <CableNinja> go buy a pack from horrible freight for like $10
[09:06:01] <JollyRgrs> unless the spot is too tight for a wrench and you need a socket... but the bolt is 8" long on top, in that case, you really want a drill and not a ratchet b/c OMG your arm would be too tired to jerk it that night
[09:06:08] <yuken> yeah, can't fit a wrench in there.
[09:06:09] <Hobadee> Wouldn't the woman be the socket and the guy be the bolt?
[09:06:31] <JollyRgrs> yuken: just google for "extensions" on the internet, i might suggest the horse hair ones
[09:06:39] <CableNinja> lol
[09:06:53] <yuken> l u l
[09:07:12] <JollyRgrs> Hobadee: i was referring to cryptic1's mom's gooch as the socket
[09:07:38] <JollyRgrs> yuken: wtf are you trying to do?
[09:07:51] <CableNinja> get his socket off obviously
[09:07:56] <yuken> JollyRgrs, buttstock of a shotgun
[09:07:58] <Hobadee> JollyRgrs: Ah.  Well, I think 3/4" would be WAY too big for yuken's bolt...
[09:07:59] <yuken> trying to disassemble it.
[09:08:10] <JollyRgrs> you mean dissemble it?
[09:08:14] <JollyRgrs> huehuehue
[09:08:20] <yuken> wot
[09:08:22] <CableNinja> Hobadee, yeah probably closer to 10mm, too bad no one can ever find the 10mm socket
[09:08:31] <JollyRgrs> the always elusive 10mm
[09:08:42] <JollyRgrs> i got like 3 of em right now, don't mess with me! and NOT YOU CANNOT BORROW IT!
[09:09:07] <CableNinja> the ultimate 'fuck you', buy someone a camouflage 10mm socket
[09:09:10] <JollyRgrs> i think even if i use something else, as i put it away, i keep the 10mm on the ratchet
[09:09:22] <Hobadee> Oh, we are talking tools for guns now?  This is my favorite... Since Amazon doesn't allow "gun" related stuff: https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UPV0hGOjL._AC_SX466_.jpg
[09:09:35] <JollyRgrs> HAHAHA.. or no... better yet... a non-ferrous (or non-magnetically attracted, whatever) one
[09:09:39] <yuken> Hobadee, lol, I've seen that.
[09:09:40] <CableNinja> JollyRgrs, I watched a 10mm disappear right before my eyes
[09:09:46] <yuken> I have that exact same wrench a few feet away Hobadee.
[09:09:49] <Hobadee> yuken: I bought that.
[09:09:58] <Work-BWMerlin> I think that biggest FU would be to buy the feedom unit equivilant of 11mm, it would be just not quiet right
[09:10:02] <CableNinja> was using it, it jumped off the ratchet I watched where it fell, and it was no where to be found when I went to grab it
[09:10:31] <JollyRgrs> CableNinja: that's what happened on my wife's SUV
[09:10:36] <JollyRgrs> never heard the clink of it hitting the concrete
[09:11:01] <JollyRgrs> took out the bottom panel and still couldn't find it. tried to hard start/stop on the road and didn't find it rolling out there either
[09:11:06] <CableNinja> same
[09:11:08] <JollyRgrs> i'm pretty sure it is still stuck somewhere

[13:09:50] <rpifan> the problem with finding a good looking physiotherapist is trying to not concentrate on them but on the therapy lol
[13:10:04] <lancehead> Get a bad looking one, problem solved 
[13:11:15] <rpifan> well i had a bad looking one before and he was awful

[13:11:27] <rpifan> this one is competent but also good looking
[13:11:42] <lancehead> I could use a physiotherapist tbh 
[13:12:51] <lancehead> Hey rpifan, are you actually an rpi guy 
[13:13:43] <rpifan> luckily the german insurance pays for most of it
[13:13:48] <rpifan> my posture and neck are terrible
[13:14:06] <rpifan> i really hate IT work but i like the mental challenge in another way
[13:14:09] <lancehead> Same, and I have a disorder relating to my jaw that gives me nerve pain 
[13:14:16] <rpifan> eventually ill find a different kind of job
[13:14:45] <lancehead> @ rpifan , you know anything about Raspberry Pi hardening? 
[13:14:53] <dunz0r> Problem is most jobs seem way more boring than IT jobs.
[13:15:12] <dunz0r> And most IT jobs seem more boring than sysadmin stuff
[13:15:20] <rpifan> well i was talking to a guy who said he wnted to work in a cosmetic spa later on in life
[13:15:24] <rpifan> and im liek thats not a bad idea
[13:15:28] <rpifan> calm chill space
[13:15:49] <rpifan> well in germany sysadmin jobs are support jobs 75 percent of the time
[13:16:47] <dunz0r> Ugh, massage old peoples faces half of the day, sit on your butt 25%, sort soaps nicely the 25% remaining. No thanks
[13:17:17] <dunz0r> I've worked in retail and in restaurants, and as a caretaker... none of it is as nice as sysadmining :)
[13:17:22] <lancehead> sounds like heaven... 
[13:17:45] <rpifan> well soon enough you will be an old person that needs a face massage
[13:17:54] <rpifan> i really dont see most ppl in here getting a face lift or plastic surgery
[13:17:57] <lancehead> I'm a 20 year old that needs a face massage. 
[13:18:07] <dunz0r> rpifan: Tbh, I kind of like the support part of my job. Helping people with their problems makes me happy.
[13:18:16] <rpifan> im sure some of you will eventually go for the botox and the filler too but IT ppl certainly arent primary uses of comsetic services
[13:18:43] <rpifan> dunz0r, yea i do also find some joy in fixing ppls issues. my first day joke at work is always, hello im the sys admin im here to fix all of your problems
[13:19:04] <rpifan> dunz0r, if you are a good looking 20 year, everyone will want to give you a face massage lol
[13:19:09] <lancehead> In other news; Suricata looks like a really good NIDS... 
[13:19:10] <dunz0r> lancehead: Nothing wrong with getting a face massage. Spa's are nice as fuck. Highly recommend it
[13:19:30] <lancehead> dunz0r: I might just have to go for it, my sinuses tend to kill me lol 
[13:19:31] <dunz0r> rpifan: Unfortunately I'm a average looking 35 year old fat bastard :)

[18:15:45] <interop_madness> best I could come up with at a price range below $5000 were the Nubert NuVero

[18:15:50] <vinrock> lool fuck that
[18:15:51] <JollyRgrs> or was it thunderbird by then? i can't remember what i was using
[18:16:03] <vinrock> i have the laser lights in my bmw and i dont even want to think how much those owuld cost to fix
[18:16:15] <Jaelae> it would be cheaper to remove both headlights and replace with non-adaptive
