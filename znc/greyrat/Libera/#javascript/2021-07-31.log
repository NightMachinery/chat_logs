[04:38:05] <Slade> err is it ok to not merge them and do app.domain.com api.domain.com
[04:40:41] <GreenJello> Slade, you would do a subdomain for a public API, but for internal use usually the API server is your frontend server
[04:41:24] <Slade> GreenJello, can you elaborate on the rationale of that?
[04:42:01] <GreenJello> I can't think of a reason you'd want them to be on separate subdomains, and would require you to deal with CORS
[04:42:58] <Slade> well they're 2 separate apps, with different hosting concepts. lots of work to merge them
[04:43:17] <Slade> the CORS is the part i'm curious about

[04:46:50] <GreenJello> you only need to serve the html files from your main server
[04:47:08] <GreenJello> everything else can go on another domain
[04:47:38] <Slade> 'your main server' is what?
[04:48:00] <GreenJello> your API/frontend server
[04:48:16] <GreenJello> the thing the user points their browser at
[04:48:35] <Slade> i see. so you're suggesting things like assets go to another domain
[04:48:47] <Slade> images
[04:48:58] <GreenJello> yeah, the css/js/images/video don't care where they're served from
[04:49:40] <Slade> but it vastly simplifies thing if   app.domain.com/index.html   calls  app.domain.com/api/whoami
[04:49:59] <Slade> is that what you're saying?
[04:50:04] <GreenJello> yeah
[04:50:30] <Slade> i was hoping it'd be more friendly considering same tld
[04:50:51] <Slade> well same domain.com
[04:51:28] <GreenJello> you can make all subdomains share cookies, but then it's not great if you want to run anything else on another subdomain
[04:52:05] <Slade> really in my idea of app.domain.com / api.domain.com   only api ever reads/sets the cookies. so
[04:52:25] <Slade> app.domain.com is cookie free for all requests
[04:53:07] <GreenJello> then you can't inject session data into the html, which is super useful
[04:53:29] <Slade> could you elaborate on that?
[04:53:41] <GreenJello> !server data
[04:53:41] <jellobot> GreenJello, There's 3 options to properly get data from the server to the client: 1) fetch request from JS. 2) HTML data-* attributes, read them in JS. 3) <script type="application/json"></script>, read and parse it from JS, however this option requires special escaping of </script> in the json body. Never generate/template JS on the fly. See also !fetch
[04:54:03] <Slade> you mean i cant read the cookie?
[04:54:55] <GreenJello> using techniques 2 or 3 there, you can include information about the logged in user in the initial html, allowing your frontend code to immediately have that information instead of making an extra round trip after JS is downloaded and starts executing
[04:55:46] <GreenJello> for that to be possible, you need the domain/server the user is navigating to have access to the session and to be able to resolve the user data
[04:56:00] <GreenJello> so it pretty much has to be your main API server handling html page requests
[04:56:04] <Slade> by 'session' you mean cookie?
[04:56:37] <GreenJello> I assume you're storing a session token in the cookie
[04:57:07] <Slade> usually use an authheader with some httponly cookies backing it
[04:57:49] <GreenJello> I'm not familiar with that approach
[04:58:51] <Slade> basically i login, get a jwt. that gets added to the Authorization: Bearer  header

[05:04:21] <wroathe> Slade: I don't know what it means to "mungle it in my ingress", but one of the primary concerns in the traditional oauth model is establishing that client applications that receive tokens are "untrusted", because of the potential for malicious scripts to be executed on the client that transmit bearer tokens to malicious parties. HttpOnly cookies avoid that by making it so that Javascript can't access
[05:04:27] <wroathe> the access token.
[05:05:14] <Slade> wroathe, i mean i could store it in the cookie, and pull it out of the cookie and add it to the header in my istio ingress

[05:09:02] <wroathe> Slade: In order to estimate your risk you'd need to analyze the possible places in your application that could be used to inject malicious code. For example, a XSS attack would seek to store a script in your database from an input, and that script would then get output in the client application

[05:09:59] <wroathe> Slade: Another possibility is that attackers somehow get access to your CI agents, or your build artifact server, and inject their code as part of your build
[05:10:20] <Slade> btw in the case of mobile app, i just have the client generate an asymmetric key, and claim to login. it gets a jwt encrypted with that key.. my assumption is, if it can decrypt and get the JWT for use, then its authenticated :P

[05:44:20] <bobdobbs> This is the kind of scenario I'm thinking about: I often build political petition or Send An Email To Your Representative pages. I usually build them on WordPress using page builders and plugins. But I'm thinking that with React I can build resources like this that load faster and respond more nimbly to user input.

[05:50:08] <wroathe> bobdobbs: React and wordpress fit different needs, and could be used together.
[05:50:33] <wroathe> bobdobbs: There's nothing stopping you from loading React in a wordpress template, and using that to build your front end
[05:50:58] <bobdobbs> wroathe: yeah, I figure that further down the track I might get the skills to build a react frontend to WordPress-as-a-cms
[05:51:34] <bobdobbs> wroathe: from time-to-time I look into what other agencies are doing with js-frontends/wp-backends
[05:51:58] <wroathe> bobdobbs: Also, because React is a UI library it doesn't have anything to do with the database. It's use cases are fairly limited in scope.

[05:53:20] <wroathe> Someone else will have to help with suggestions.
[05:53:22] <bobdobbs> np. I'm pretty noobish.
[05:53:51] <wroathe> bobdobbs: Consider reading the React tutorial on teh reactjs.org site while you wait
[05:54:54] <bobdobbs> yeah. At the moment I'm googling around just to get an idea of the information ecosystem / culture around React, and to see if the direction I'm thinking in fits the parameters of React orthodoxy
[05:55:44] <wroathe> bobdobbs: I don't have the full scope of what you typically build, but those two things you described sound like React would be overkill for
[05:55:56] <bobdobbs> huh. ok.
[05:56:13] <wroathe> bobdobbs: But get a second opinion before you make any rash decisions :P
[05:56:22] <bobdobbs> :
[05:56:24] <bobdobbs> :)
[05:56:44] <GreenJello> yeah, you're likely better off progressively enhancing server rendered markup there
[05:57:16] <bobdobbs> GreenJello: I'm gonna go ahead and do some googling to figure out what you mean by that
[05:57:22] <GreenJello> you can submit with ajax if JS loads successfully, which is usually better than a real form submit for presentation and handling errors
[05:57:55] <wroathe> bobdobbs: In a word, keep using Wordpress, and just up your Javascript game.
[05:58:17] <bobdobbs> wroathe: yeah, that's part of why I'm looking into React
[05:58:17] <wroathe> bobdobbs: I believe Wordpress now includes a REST API layer
[05:58:20] <GreenJello> you render the form and set it up to work as if JS were enabled, and then your JS adds on top of it to improve the experience when possible
[05:58:28] <GreenJello> disabled*
[05:58:36] <bobdobbs> wroathe: it does indeed. I haven't worked with it yet. Not properly anyway.
[05:58:51] <bobdobbs> GreenJello: oh yup. I see
[05:59:14] <GreenJello> also React generally loads slower than server rendered markup, since it has to download, parse, and execute JS before anything is displayed
[06:00:48] <GreenJello> you can get around that with server rendering of React components, but that's probably too much work and deployment difficulty for a site that's a single small form
[06:01:48] <GreenJello> good to learn react for other projects, though :-)

[07:43:17] <matsaman> throttling requests smartly is probably good enough
[07:43:26] <theskillwithin> sheetjs ya, AWS isn't letting me renew the ssl cert,  nor letting me delete it lol.  so thats the first thing i need to fix
[07:43:44] <matsaman> systemfault: pretty broad, but obviously electronics are bad for the environment at this time
[07:43:54] <sheetjs> it's important to identify how they are bad
[07:44:10] <theskillwithin> i prob should move all my domains out of godaddy to aws route 53
[07:44:15] <ciphrCat> systemfault: doesn't it depend on the design? Javacript can potentially be more lean than static HTML, but OTOH there's some very bloated js out there that brings my system down
[07:44:22] <sheetjs> for example, a locked down device with no provision to unlock its general computing capabilities is e-waste
[07:46:33] <matsaman> I mean, for most sites, rendering once server-side instead of infinite times client side is going to be most efficient
[07:46:41] <matsaman> not necessarily for the person paying for the server
[07:46:45] <matsaman> but for the world
[07:47:06] <matsaman> some sites are obviously more dynamic than that would be feasible for
[07:47:11] <theskillwithin> ciphrCat there is a way you can influence things,  vote for a 3rd party.  if a 3rd party gains 10% of voters, ud think that would be worthless, but no, then both parties will have to bargin with the 3rd party voters

[07:47:50] <matsaman> it's problematic to say things like "both parties" in the first place
[07:48:01] <ciphrCat> Cloudflare actually deems all robots that are not search crawlers as "malicious", which is not just wrong, but it cause CF to block the most environmentally friendly traffic there is (as bots don't generally grab images)
[07:48:14] <matsaman> that just reinforces the imaginary idea that somehow two prominent parties is normal or official, which isn't the case
[07:48:38] <matsaman> ohwell, they'll fail like every other company one day
[07:48:41] <theskillwithin> or its just acknowledging the reality of the situation
[07:48:47] <ciphrCat> theskillwithin: i can't vote at all, ironically because Cloudflare blocks voter registration (and i boycott CF)
[07:48:56] <matsaman> ha
[07:49:08] <matsaman> honestly can't say I use that many sites that use them
[07:49:10] <matsaman> or anything like them
[07:49:18] <matsaman> have to use gitlab for work sometimes, that's about it
[07:49:30] <theskillwithin> i prefer cloudfront cuz its right there in aws
[07:49:47] <matsaman> that doesn't sound like an end user insight =P
[07:50:14] <ciphrCat> matsaman: regarding gitlab, i suggest reading this: https://git.sdf.org/humanacollaborator/humanacollabora/src/branch/master/gitlab-dot-com.md  Gitlab.com is worse than github
[07:50:31] <theskillwithin> for a side project i might consider using cloudinary for the first time to handle my images
[07:50:36] <theskillwithin> not sure yet
[07:50:43] <matsaman> ciphrCat: I mean github is microsoft, so I don't see how that's possible
[07:50:59] <ciphrCat> read the article.  Gitlab.com is Cloudflare
[07:51:00] <matsaman> but I'm not invested in gitlab, it's just a thing we use at work that I had no say in
[07:51:15] <matsaman> yeah I just got done saying I have to use gitlab for work which uses cloudflare
[07:51:33] <ciphrCat> i can't even read Gitlab.com bug reports because of the exclusive walled-garden
[07:51:39] <matsaman> "cloudinary", what a name =P
[07:51:54] <matsaman> you wouldn't want to anyway
[07:51:58] <matsaman> their bug closing rate is shite
[07:52:18] <matsaman> and I've lost track of how many times they've closed all bugs and moved them to some other separate bug tracker, and back
[07:52:28] <theskillwithin> matsaman which one, cloudinary?
[07:52:32] <ciphrCat> i mean, not the gitlab project itself.. but i can't read bug reports for *any* project hosted on gitlab.com b/c of cloudflare captcha
[07:52:32] <matsaman> no gitlab
[07:52:35] <theskillwithin> ah
[07:52:43] <matsaman> their codebase is clearly immense and unmanageable
[07:52:45] <matsaman> they're boned
[07:53:27] <theskillwithin> dang that sucks, i thought they were kinda cool.  (even tho i prefer github)
[07:53:36] <ciphrCat> boycott Github, Boycott Gitlab.com, choose a whitelisted forge from this list: https://git.sdf.org/humanacollaborator/humanacollabora/src/branch/master/forge_comparison.md

[07:54:03] <matsaman> honestly there is so little reason to use a hosted-only VCS
[07:54:15] <matsaman> you can even download gitlab and install it on your own server
[07:54:23] <matsaman> or, y'know, skip the frontend to get altogether
[07:54:51] <matsaman> dunno why people like relying on third parties / services so much
[07:55:04] <matsaman> I mean because it's easy in the short run and makes them look good, but
[07:55:05] <sheetjs> no one gets fired for choosing ibm

[07:58:01] <theskillwithin> haha sheetjs
[07:58:07] <ciphrCat> matsaman: it's for collaboration. Maintaining an always-on machine for the general public involves effort, risk, and responsibility
[07:58:12] <sheetjs> sheetjs is a
[07:58:18] <sheetjs> way of life
[07:58:24] <ciphrCat> if you're a one-man show, then indeed you don't need a forge
[07:58:26] <sheetjs> its a celebration of our shared heritage
[07:58:32] <matsaman> I'd rather have that risk than the risk of relying on random strangers
[07:58:53] <ciphrCat> it's still easier to mirror
[07:59:18] <ciphrCat> there's also software heritage, plus every developer has a copy of the repo

[08:08:52] <ciphrCat> systemfault: also regarding your question, i think javascript is often harmful to the environment as a result of uMatrix.  uMatrix disables js for some sites, user must enable selectively and reload.  Then the javascript that runs spawns offspring js that's nested, which then must be enabled and the same site must be reloaded again
[08:09:13] <ciphrCat> I often have to reload a webpage ~3-5 times because of the nesting

[21:09:50] <Lyn> so if I understand it correctly, static react files can be served with either nginx or node -- which is the preferred choice in a container, or are there other sensible options?
[21:11:09] <sheetjs> you can also use node with an nginx proxy
[21:11:27] <GreenJello> Lyn, serving them with node in production is not great, especially if in the same process as handing API requests as those can add latency to static asset fetches
[21:12:10] <GreenJello> either nginx can serve the static files, or something like S3 + a CDN works well
[21:12:19] <sillyslux__> what files are considered "static react files"?!
[21:12:55] <sillyslux__> like componentXY.jsx?

[21:17:47] <sheetjs> actually that's how we test printf
[21:17:54] <sillyslux__> i have an ai that teaches and orchestrates whole zoo of ai's for on-the-fly code generation
[21:18:20] <sheetjs> node script generates a header file, then c preprocessor generates JS code and C code
[21:18:24] <Lyn> sillys do you have a generator to power those AIs
[21:18:27] <sheetjs> and the outputs of both are compared

[23:19:55] <celphi> well two objects
[23:20:06] <wroathe> celphi: So how did you track recency?
[23:20:45] <wroathe> My first thought is using a Map
[23:20:57] <wroathe> And then delete keys and re-insert them whenever they're accessed
[23:21:16] <celphi> i showed example of size and he was happy enough with my example
[23:21:44] *** Quits: yaalon (~yaalon@189.202.79.36.cable.dyn.cableonline.com.mx) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:22:26] <wroathe> celphi: Example of size? I mean, if it's a least recently used cache you'd have to have some way of indicating the access order. Objects don't necessarily provide you that (or well, they didn't use to)
[23:23:06] <han-solo> i was thinking `key : [value, access_count]` ?
[23:23:15] <wroathe> AFAIK it's typically a doubly linked queue for maintaining the access order, and a hash table with pointers into that queue for constant access time
[23:23:48] <wroathe> han-solo: The problem with that is you'd have to loop through all of the entries to find the lowest access counts, and access count doesn't track order of access, which is what this needs

[23:24:10] <han-solo> mm, true
[23:24:32] <wroathe> I think a Map probably gives you nice asymptotics with this, while maintaining insertion order
[23:24:47] <wroathe> So if you just delete and re-add each key you access, you'll have the least recently used keys first
[23:25:36] <celphi> https://bpa.st/GEWQ
[23:25:43] <celphi> is the basic idea
[23:26:51] <celphi> of course the string input would be much much longer so longer computation

[23:32:37] <wroathe> celphi: Something like this is what I was thinking
[23:34:14] <celphi> yeah with time you could just add to a queue, but he specifically asked me how would i manage the object size
[23:34:25] <han-solo> did they base the max size of the cache based on the sum of the numbers ? :/
[23:34:29] <han-solo> maybe i read it wrong
[23:35:21] <celphi> no it's a whiteboarding exxaample han-solo- the keys represent the size and if more than one cache value has that size it's pushed onto the array of that key
[23:35:39] <han-solo> ah, i read it wrong, sorry

[23:35:54] *** Quits: sickdyd (~sickd@120.51.82.69.ap.gmobb-fix.jp) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[23:35:59] <celphi> so the idea is to remove the keys that take up the most space
[23:37:06] <wroathe> This doesn't seem like an LRU cache though?
[23:37:16] <wroathe> What's enforcing the least-recently used part?
[23:37:20] <celphi> he changed the requiresments
[23:37:28] <wroathe> Ah
[23:37:32] <celphi> he wanted it based on size
[23:37:50] <celphi> but he did ask about time
[23:38:06] <celphi> and i explained you could just use a queue
[23:38:21] <wroathe> Ah. Nice.
[23:38:36] <GreenJello> an LRU cache can be size based, but I think it's just deleting the least recently used until you have enough space to insert the new item
[23:38:46] <GreenJello> not searching for the largest entries
[23:39:04] <wroathe> GreenJello: yeah, that's how I've always thought of it

[23:40:28] <celphi> neat editor
[23:40:47] <wroathe> GreenJello: yeah, I probably should've included insert for completeness :P
[23:41:58] <wroathe> Insertion-ordered hash tables are a mystery to me
[23:41:59] <GreenJello> celphi, thanks, it's my current personal project
[23:42:12] <wroathe> I'll need to do a deep dive on Map's implementation one of these days
[23:42:28] <celphi> looks really clean
[23:46:52] <celphi> GreenJello: why do you return inside access
[23:47:59] <GreenJello> that was in wroathe's as well, and it's because with an LRU cache you need to update the order of recent accesses while getting any entry
[23:48:19] <GreenJello> access is get+track
[23:48:44] <celphi> right but isnt the object already mutated- why return the value
[23:49:08] <GreenJello> it's how you get the value for a key
[23:49:44] <GreenJello> better to have that in one function call instead of relying on the code always performing both parts itself
[23:50:10] <celphi> if i comment that line out i get same results
[23:50:12] <GreenJello> you use access instead of lru.get
[23:50:52] <GreenJello> console.log('the value of baz is', access('baz', lru));
[23:51:03] <GreenJello> would be a more realistic example

[23:51:24] <celphi> ok. so to get the value accessed

[23:52:03] <celphi> does Map always maintain the key-value order like that?
[23:52:13] <GreenJello> it's insertion order, yes
[23:52:24] <GreenJello> so removing and then reinserting it will just move it to the end
[23:52:29] <celphi> i thought javascript automaticaly resorted

[23:54:20] <GreenJello> Map is always insertion order
[23:55:08] <GreenJello> that is a thing with object keys
[23:55:12] <celphi> i see - so that's just with Objects

[23:56:02] <celphi> i knew about the stringification of keys in objects but didnt know about the insertion order
[23:56:15] <wroathe> celphi: Yeah, with this LRU cache implementation you'd treat the lru Map object as an opaque handle, and expose functions like access and insert that need to be used instead of lru.get and lru.set
