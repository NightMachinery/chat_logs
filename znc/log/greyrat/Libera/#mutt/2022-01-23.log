[22:11:54] <rkta> kevin8t8: Have fun with your spare time and thanks for your work! Is there a successor yet?
[22:18:33] <kevin8t8> rkta: thanks.  I'm going to get the "as-is" :cd complietion committed this week.  It's not high quality, but it's something :-)
[22:18:55] <rkta> that's great news!
[22:19:54] <kevin8t8> rkta: no successor planned for now.  but I'm not disappearing, just backing off of new development.  i'll make sure bug fixes and security issues get addressed...
[22:22:01] <rkta> kevin8t8: ah, ok, it sounded like you'll drop maintainership. But you'll still be the maintainer, but do maintainer work only, no active development.
[22:24:19] <kevin8t8> rkta: it's funny, when you put it like that maybe it's so.
[22:25:02] <kevin8t8> rkta: but my intent is to back out of the responsibility slowly, without just letting the project die.
[22:27:27] <rkta> kevin8t8: my definition of maintainer is someone who keeps the project alive, not someone who adds new features. Not a native speaker, though. I think it's a fair choice, let the community suggest/implement the features they want.
[22:29:11] <rkta> mutt is nearly feature complete anyways.
[22:35:22] <kevin8t8> rkta: yeah I think I've been doing both roles.  but the line I'm drawing is that I won't shepherd 2.3.0 out in the future, or review/commit features to the master branch towards that.  I'll make sure security/bug fixes get made to 2.2.x, but if there is a desire for a 2.3.0 release in the future, someone else will have to do that.
[22:45:30] <rkta> kevin8t8: I totally understand, but I hope you have someone in mind to take over or at least review and pick high quality contributions until someone new is found. I don't want to put pressure on you, I guess finding a new maintainer in a less active project like mutt is hard. And getting used to code base like mutt is hard, so who ever will come to succeed will need some guidance - where I think, reviewing patches is a good way to enable someone to become 
[22:45:30] <rkta> knowledgable enough to take over.
