[07:47:15] <sudoforge> how is it a "pain"?
[07:49:44] <sh4rk> well i have this image with a Dockerfile that has to build, and i use docker-compose
[07:49:55] <sh4rk> the build takes so long cause the requirements.txt due to python flask being bloated
[07:50:30] <sh4rk> pip takes its time installing stuff to get everything back up and running, and this is when i want to make changes to the volume itself
[07:50:42] <sh4rk> i've tried rm'ing the volume and restarting the daemon, that doesnt do anything
[07:50:58] <sh4rk> do i need to docker build . then use docker-compose off that build?
[07:51:38] <sh4rk> it was originally a multi-piece project but i removed one of them because im no longer using php, just python strictly
[07:51:59] <sh4rk> converted all my php work to python
[07:52:29] <sh4rk> or is it better to bounce back and forth between the 2? i find session hard to keep track between all of this
[07:52:58] <sh4rk> i use basic session cookies, no crsf tokens or any crap like that, old school
[07:53:21] <sh4rk> im good at both languages but not that good, help? lol
[07:54:10] <sh4rk> i just need to figure out a way to get this app up without a 4 min build each time it's started with a new image which is needed to get new info into the container
[07:55:34] <sh4rk> ive been doing docker-compose --remove-orphans ; docker volume rm docker-alpine-php-nginx-phalcon_appdata ; docker image prune -a ; docker-compose up -d --build (i dont actually have to type --build here, its going to do it anyway)
[07:56:25] <sh4rk> should i build first then run off that daemon?
[07:56:47] <sh4rk> and update the docker volume within that same instance?

[18:43:25] <steerpike> hi, can someone explain why my docker container requires --network host to reach out?
[18:43:34] <steerpike> to the internet*
[18:44:15] <BtbN> Sounds like you managed to mess up your docker networking on your host.
[18:44:16] <gordonjcp> steerpike: because that way it's connected to the network on the host, which is in turn connected to the Internet, presumably
[18:44:35] <gordonjcp> steerpike: without more information on what you're trying to do, it's hard to be more specific
[18:46:25] <programmerq> yeah, that sounds like a broken docker installation
[18:47:04] <programmerq> firewall management tools can interfere with the iptables rules that docker sets up.
[18:47:31] <gordonjcp> I need to figure out how to make fail2ban play nice with docker
[18:47:38] <programmerq> you can also effectively break docker by running it with 'dockerd --iptables=false'
[18:48:12] <gordonjcp> steerpike: what ports have you published?
[18:48:39] *** Quits: ExeciN (~ExeciN@user/nicexe) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:48:42] <steerpike> none
[18:49:50] <steerpike> ah
[18:49:54] <steerpike> i think i know the issue
[18:49:55] <programmerq> the net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding needs to be enabled for container egress to work too
[18:50:11] <steerpike> egresses weren't the issue
[18:50:26] <programmerq> "to reach out to the internet" -- that sounds like egress
[18:50:47] <gordonjcp> steerpike: what exactly are you doing, and what are you experiencing?  And, how does that differ from what you expect?
[18:50:54] <steerpike> i'm in an airgapped environment, so i needed to be able to provide HTTP_PROXY env variable
[18:51:06] <programmerq> ah yup, that'd do it.
[18:51:15] <steerpike> that wasn't the issue though
[18:51:28] <steerpike> i provided the http_proxy var, and it still wasn't working
[18:51:46] <steerpike> it couldn't reach out to the pkg repo to install packages
[18:52:12] <gordonjcp> was it attempting to go via the proxy?
[18:52:30] <programmerq> ah, apt has its own config file for http proxy and doesn't look at the var
[18:52:41] <steerpike> it couldn't resolve the hostname using the /etc/resolv.conf that alpine was packaged with
[18:52:52] <steerpike> this was in alpine
[18:53:06] <steerpike> since the domain is maintained internally
[18:53:16] <steerpike> by default it uses 8.8.8.8, etc
[18:54:14] <programmerq> when you use the docker0 network, if your host's /etc/resolv.conf only has 127.0.0.x resolvers, docker will write out 8.8.8.8. You can set the correct dns resolver ip in the dockerd config
[18:54:58] <programmerq> for 'docker network create' type networks, docker will write out 127.0.0.11 and docker listens on that ip for dns requests. since docker essentially acts as the dns server, it can turn around and use your host's /etc/resolv.conf on the host side.
[18:55:21] <steerpike> well, that would be tricky since the containers themselves run dns :/
[18:55:48] <steerpike> so if i'm redeploying it, dns would be unavailable
[18:56:42] <steerpike> the host's resolv.conf just points to 127.0.0.1
[18:57:58] <programmerq> in that case, I'd say your dns containers on the docker0 network should be created with 'docker run --dns 1.2.3.4 ...' for whatever ip they should use for their upstream.
[18:58:14] <programmerq> then docker will write out the /etc/resolv.conf with those values.
[18:58:24] <steerpike> gotcha
[18:58:29] <steerpike> thanks

[19:40:51] <IceMichael> hi guys
[19:41:24] <IceMichael> question, I'm trying to get some simple dotnet app into a docker on macos. If I run (in the published folder) dotnet dotnet-rest-test.dll, I can access 5000 via the browser
[19:41:38] <IceMichael> but if I build and run it does not work, I just don't get access
[19:41:54] <IceMichael> for run, I just passed -P to publish every port to make it easy enough
[19:42:30] <IceMichael> not sure how to troubleshoot here... I tried to run docker with entrypoint bash but there are no linux commands like netstat there to check if/what is listening where

[19:47:53] <Sqaure> Im using this guide to install compose V2 for all users on linux https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/. But somehow docker is unable to find the installed binary under /usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins
[19:47:56] <dodo> IceMichael: exec a shell with --user=0 and install what you need?
[19:48:44] *** Joins: arseru (uid515527@user/arseru)
[19:49:35] <IceMichael> dodo: ah checking, thanks
[19:50:04] <arseru> Hi! can somebody explain why can't I remove this pip.conf file? https://bpa.st/IBAA
[19:50:44] <arseru> It lets me delete the one in .config/ folder, but not the one in workdir/, and I can't figure out why.
[19:52:54] <IceMichael> hm, okay, my Dockerfile etc. works locally now. I have also created Docker engine on my rented server, what is the usual way to publish it there and have it running? (keywords for google are fine)
[19:53:11] <nr0q_radio> docker hub
[19:54:03] <programmerq> Sqaure▸ what version of the docker CLI are you running?
[19:55:22] <IceMichael> nr0q_radio: thanks
[19:56:13] <Sqaure> programmerq, https://paste.ofcode.org/CyAaNA5r4CKM4rD5CuWbSM 
[19:56:26] <Sqaure> idk is the answer. Maybe i dont have docker-cli?
[19:57:37] <Sqaure> if "docker-cli" isnt docker client? I have docker client i assume.
[19:58:04] <programmerq> the 'docker' command
[19:58:18] <jmartin> CLI = command line interface
[19:58:50] <Sqaure> right so it looks like i have 20.10.7 and api version 1.41
[19:58:50] <programmerq> 20.10.7 is your version. that should be plenty new enough to work with cli plugins.
[20:00:01] <Sqaure> im wondering if theres some setting somewhere that confuses docker
[20:02:04] <Sqaure> should "compose V2" show up if i write "docker plugin ls"?
[20:02:48] <Sqaure> ...i just have an empty list there (barring headers)
[20:08:46] <programmerq> 'docker plugin ls' is just going to show you what dockerd plugins there are.
[20:09:16] <programmerq> if you install a cli plugin, then you just start using it like this: docker compose help

[22:30:49] <canurabus> Hi. I'm trying to push an image "abc" I loaded using `docker load <abc.tar.gz>` to a local docker repo. Once the image is loaded, I see it with the repo "localhost:5000/abc" and tag "debug" when I run `docker images`. When I finally run `docker push localhost:5000/abc:debug" I receive the error message "An image does not exist locally with the tag: localhost:5000:/abc". Does anyone know what I'm doigng wrong

[23:05:40] <programmerq> canurabus▸ yeah, that second : implies that you typed: docker push localhost:5000:/abc:debug
[23:07:16] <programmerq> although I can't quite get a similar behavior. perhaps you typed out the error message and the docker push command instead of copy/paste?
[23:08:03] <programmerq> open a new terminal, and issue tho following two commands: "docker image ls" "docker push localhost:5000/abc:debug"
[23:08:15] <programmerq> select everything in that whole terminal window, and paste it using a paste service.
[23:08:48] <canurabus> I think I've made a typo somewhere... I can't copy/paste directly but let me do a better job of typing it out
