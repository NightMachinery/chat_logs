[04:07:27] <at0m> Enissay: -r detaches existing sessions, if any, -x does not. with -x, for example, you can leave a screen attached on another machine, or help out a friend in their session so you can both use the same session, say to show something. in the same or in other windows.
[04:08:40] <at0m> Enissay: -x has the disadvantage of not resizing to the current session if some other session is attached
[04:09:09] <Enissay> Oh, share a session, that's neat
[04:09:40] <Enissay> at0m: what do you mean by resizing ?
[04:10:26] <at0m> Enissay: say the other session is 80x40, and new window is 120x60, you'll see 80x40

[04:59:37] <somiaj> where is this ranger.py installed?
[05:00:26] <ranger> in the folder called ranger, its a file manager for the terminal
[05:00:31] <somiaj> Also why do you want to be in the directory ranger? would 'python /path/to/ranger.py' run the script for you? You could also use a shebang (there might be better alternatives)
[05:00:37] <ranger> /home/ranger
[05:01:19] <ranger> Cool fo the somiaj, I am only 8 weeks a student, so I didn't know you could do that
[05:01:20] <somiaj> personally I would put '#!/usr/bin/python3' (assuming python3) as the first line of ranger.py, then ln -fs /home/ranger/ranger.py /usr/local/bin/ranger -- then the command 'ranger' will just run that script since it is in your path
[05:01:33] <somiaj> note ranger.py may alraedy have a shebang in it
[05:01:55] <ranger> i've heard of sheebang butI will have to research more about it

[05:02:27] <somiaj> you could also link this to $HOME/bin instead of /usr/local/bin/ if you want it for a single user

[20:39:32] <jmd> into the the kernels device table
[20:39:41] <kveroneau> jmd, you may need to either write your own service to initialize it, if it's not supported by an existing Debian package, or run the needed commands to initiate it via /etc/rc.local
[20:39:51] <kveroneau> If it's a kernel module, you can add it to /etc/modules.d/

[20:40:13] <kveroneau> Rather /etc/modules
[20:40:17] <jmd> I thought about /etc/rc.local but thought there might be a better way.
[20:41:14] <jmd> No  module is required.  The drivers are already in the kernel.  I just want to add a device and bring it up. and I want it to happen at boot time.
[20:42:14] *** Joins: rob-z (~rob@2001:980:9cbb:1::2)
[20:42:58] <kveroneau> jmd, you could try using a udev rule to run a script to initialize it when it detects the device.  That'd be the most elegant way, but it's also more complicated.
