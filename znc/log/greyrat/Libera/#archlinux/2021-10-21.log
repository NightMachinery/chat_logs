[00:00:19] <topcat001> I am currently using approach 1 + openvpn on my road warrior laptop and works just fine.
[00:01:27] <jirido> Ithink I have had NM+resolved 
[00:01:51] <jirido> My /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf is all empty
[00:01:59] <jirido> is this OK?
[00:02:10] <jaawerth> topcat001: what makes it the most elegant? because it's using something you've already got instead of installing and configuring extras?
[00:03:53] <topcat001> yes and it offers the most control (particularly resolved). For example you can configure the DNS queries to be routed to different servers depending on the domain, etc.
[00:04:10] <jirido> it said someware that it dont has support for ip6
[00:04:32] <Namarrgon> fredmorcos: so, which laptop is it?
[00:04:32] <topcat001> I like and use Networkmanager too though. Better to know more than one system.
[00:05:23] <topcat001> jirido: That may be true. I can't remember. Which case do you mean by "it"?
[00:06:01] <fredmorcos> Namarrgon: ASUS U36SD
[00:06:14] <topcat001> That elegant comment is purely my humble opinion and maybe be safely ignored if one feels otherwise ;)
[00:06:39] <jirido> NM's dns 
[00:07:36] <jirido> Thats It I would like to make an informed desition on what I should invest on , not an emotional one
[00:07:52] <topcat001> jirido: That surprises me greatly re: NM and ipv6 DNS.
[00:08:00] <jirido> It's so complicated in my mind that.. Puhh
[00:08:44] <topcat001> Does not seem true: https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager/DNS

[00:11:11] <et09> im having a weird time after i rebooted too ... 
[00:11:29] <jirido> no it was dhcp
[00:12:01] <topcat001> NM certainly works fine with DHCP and its DNS.
[00:12:09] <topcat001> I am using it.
[00:12:20] <jirido> NetworkManger does not support using dhcpcd for IPv6. See NetworkManager issue #5. If dhcpcd is set as the DHCP client, NetworkManager will use the internal DHCP client for DHCPv6
[00:12:38] <jirido> Whaaat?
[00:13:25] <jirido> like I have o freeking know dhcpcd and dhcp and every little detail
[00:13:42] <topcat001> Right that is a specific setup. Is there any reason not to use the internal client?
[00:14:03] <topcat001> I mean the goal is to get things to work in the simplest possible way right?

[03:10:24] <thurstylark> Hmm... yeah, I think if you're going to trick systemd-boot into this setup, you'll have to either put the systemd-boot efi in the right place manually, or do some tomfoolery like mounting the ESP of one disk directly before running bootctl install and resyncing stuff afterwards
[03:10:40] <jab416171> should I just use another boot loader?

[05:49:02] <Sirnanigans> If I get regular crashes when running 3D games (at least in OpenGL, possibly also other modes), where the screen turns to a wash of speckled colors and the TTY becomes completely unresponsive until the Xorg session is closed via another TTY... what log do I check to investigate this issue?
[05:49:51] <Sirnanigans> I can't tell what the issue is. The best I can describe it in layman's terms is "Xorg crashes".
[05:50:03] <rcf> Sirnanigans: the xorg log itself and the journal would be a good start. 
[05:50:23] <NetSysFire> when did this start happening?
[05:50:50] <Sirnanigans> 'journal' command, right? I looked there and saw little to help, looking at xorg log now.
[05:50:57] <Sirnanigans> It started happening maybe a couple months ago.
[05:51:10] <Sirnanigans> The duration until crash is random, often times 30 minutes to several hours.

[10:50:17] <h4rd3n3D> good stuff - I figured out yesterday how to upgrade my 11 year old laptop running Win10Pro to Win11Pro, despite MSFT's supposed Win11 'requirements' of TPM 2.0 and a supported CPU.  My rig failed on both counts, but its not difficult to work around these issues.  If anyone is interested in the process, give me a shout

[18:59:18] <Namarrgon> what do you mean by "align"?

[19:03:20] <pyroplasma> yeah
[19:03:20] <Namarrgon> that's due to the terminal's grid-based nature, it couldn't fit another row in and left it blank
[19:03:34] <pyroplasma> I think that's what it is
[19:03:54] <Namarrgon> either nudge the font-size a bit or if you use a bar you can increase its height

[23:40:21] <perrierjouet> the second one was the grep

[23:40:28] <hiya> Namarrgon: yes. correct. But you have known what i did since I did archinstall :)

[23:40:48] <rcf> perrierjouet: that almost looks like you're running mpd as your normal user, or at least you're trying to. 
[23:41:02] <perrierjouet> I did killall mpd and sudo systemctl start mpd.service and it did not work

[23:41:28] <Namarrgon> what did not work?
[23:41:30] <perrierjouet> rcf: mpd used to work perfect until today
[23:41:40] <perrierjouet> the mpd.service start

[23:44:47] <Namarrgon> so you're trying to get the system service or the user service going?

[23:51:19] <perrierjouet> Namarrgon: it does not work
[23:52:08] * rcf updates to see if system mpd did something weird recently
[23:52:43] <rcf> As an aside you should avoid using the system service if possible because pulseaudio doesn't like anyone else accessing the audio device 
[23:53:35] <perrierjouet> mpc update connection refused
[23:53:48] <rcf> Well I mean that's a foregone conclusion if it won't start. 
[23:54:15] <rcf> Though giving the lingering mpd process the good old kill -9 wouldn't hurt 
[23:54:21] <Namarrgon> what is listening on port 6600?
[23:55:24] <perrierjouet> rcf I killed all the mpd process like ps aux |grep mpd, kill -9 process id then sudo systemctl restart mpd.socket and mpd.service still same error
[23:55:43] <perrierjouet> forgot to know what process listen on port 6600
[23:55:52] <perrierjouet> maybe firewall ?
[23:56:09] <Namarrgon> did you set one up?
[23:56:11] <rcf> perrierjouet: note that if you're using the socket activation you don't then manually enable or start the actual service 
[23:56:17] <perrierjouet> it used to work like I said untill yesterday and I did not mess with the firewall
[23:57:08] <rcf> Namarrgon: I think that error is actually spurious in the most recent log, mpd is somewhat infamous for that 
[23:57:10] <perrierjouet> I started only the mpd.service still same error
[23:57:24] *** Joins: alx741 (~alx741@186.178.108.23)
[23:57:35] <perrierjouet> maybe latest update related ?
[23:57:52] <rcf> Can you post your /etc/mpd.conf 
[23:58:15] *** Quits: BenjiProd (~BenjiProd@user/benjiprod) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:58:20] <perrierjouet> I use /home/perrierjouet/.config/mpd/mpd.conf instead
[23:58:33] <Namarrgon> wat
[23:58:38] <rcf> ...it doesn't work like that 
[23:58:57] <Namarrgon> what is the exact command you use to start the mpd service?
[23:59:48] <rcf> If *that* is what you want, disable the system service, disable the system socket, use `systemctl --user start mpd` (and note the lack of sudo)
