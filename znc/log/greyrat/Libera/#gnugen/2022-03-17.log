[10:41:12] <artectrex[m]> Quelqu'un utilise sway et a un remplacement pour la sauvegarde et restauration de layout? https://i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html
[10:41:32] <artectrex[m]> j'aime bien allumer mon ordi et ça popule mes workspace :/
[10:53:47] <artectrex[m]> ddevault a décidé que ça va jamais être implémenté et les gens disent d'utiliser des scripts jank
[12:02:51] <artectrex[m]> Does window focus work with firefox for you guys on wayland? :/
[12:24:36] <jonas[m]> what do you mean with "does window focuswork" ?
[12:24:51] <jonas[m]> nothing special in Gnome at least...
[12:32:19] <artectrex[m]> I don't know I click on a link and it doesn't switch to the firefox workspace
[12:32:46] <artectrex[m]> (I have the same config as I had on i3 and it works fine there)
[16:27:25] <Orbstheorem> <artectrex[m]> "Does window focus work with..." <- Yes

[18:04:45] <afontain[m]> Oh, that reminds me of somzthing
[18:05:27] <afontain[m]> I think I did without autofocus for some time. I'm not sure if I had it
[18:05:55] <afontain[m]> chances is I took the habbit of switching by myself
[18:06:20] <afontain[m]> (it was kind of zen, in a way)
