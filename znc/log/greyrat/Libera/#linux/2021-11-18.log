[04:39:43] <n4dir> mainly i got no clue of podcasts. I thought you just listen to them like usual audio. stupid me
[04:39:53] <rascul> or video
[04:40:03] <rascul> some of them have the video
[04:40:19] <knotMez> do they make you eat bugs in pods?
[04:40:20] <n4dir> and they differ from audio or video by which means?
[04:40:33] <rascul> none
[04:40:38] <n4dir> sounds a lot like a new wheel to me, but that is probably me
[04:40:50] <rascul> the fancy podcast apps have methods of subscribing to auto get new ones
[04:40:54] <rascul> that sometimes uses rss

[09:48:34] <gorgonical> ???

[11:27:05] <geirha> it does not, not. It does if you start a new shell by doing    exec ssh-agent bash   but when you run it just as ssh-agent, it starts as a child of the shell, and a child process can't modify the parent's environment
[11:28:43] <geirha> so either  eval "$(ssh-agent)"  to add the env vars to the current shell, or  exec ssh-agent bash   to replace the current shell with a new shell run via ssh-agent. With the latter ssh-agent will exit when you exit that shell. With the eval approach you have to remember to kill it yourself, else it will uselessly keep running in the background after you exit that shell

[14:00:41] <Pickchea> Hey! I was planning on setting up daily, weekly and monthly automatic backups with rsync and cron or systemd timers. I'll have a separate drive housing a directory for each the daily, weekly and monthly backup. However, I just realised that some of my files won't change for weeks or months and having 3 copies of the same file in my backup drive is useless and wasteful, especially because these backups will also be synced with my cloud storage. Instead,
[14:00:41] <Pickchea> the weekly dir should only contain files different from the monthly dir and the daily dir should only contain files different from the weekly dir. Does that sound reasonable to you? Can that be done with rsync? (If "yes" regarding the latter, I think I can figure it out myself)

[15:15:43] <Pickchea> PaulFertser, I've looked into the article a bit that you kindly linked. It seems the author pushes the whole Borg repos to the Wasabi buckets. But if Borg uses hard links (IDK if it does) then rclone would surely push each file for every hard link pointing to it, right?
[15:15:54] <hexnewbie> KDE has spare layouts, which switches the second layout in -layout with the spare layout if you temporarily need to write in Greek. That, for example, will eliminate any custom setxkbmap settings. Some other DEs can be more aggressive
[15:16:42] *** Joins: defjam (~eb0t@90.210.93.250)
[15:17:29] <PaulFertser> Pickchea: that I can't tell, sorry.
[15:18:04] <PaulFertser> Pickchea: guess Borg isn't using hardlinks and that's why it works.

[15:18:46] <jim> large storm in pacific northwest causes major damage in vankouver, canada... google for stories if you're interested (this will be the only comment on this topic here)
[15:19:04] <hexnewbie> Preserving hardlinks is a bit complicated, you need to cache the st_ino and dev_t of *every* file with nlink_t larger than 1
[15:19:12] *** Joins: dna1 (~dna@47-220-190-100.gtwncmkt04.res.dyn.suddenlink.net)
[15:20:30] <hexnewbie> So, for example, if you keep hardlinked snapshot backups (with rsnapshot or rsync -a --linkdest), then rsync -aH to copy them elsewhere can take gigabyte of RAM or more (gets particularly problematic when someone decides to run 10 of those, on trees containing 100 servers each)

[19:42:40] *** Joins: Andrynet (~Andrey@186.46.204.193)
[19:42:41] <ayecee> hans_: i bet it's like regular files, where while you can have larger than 4gb files on a 32-bit machine, there's no way to seek to an offset > 4gb with a 32-bit position value, so you'd have to use the *64 calls to get bigger ones.

[19:47:49] <keir> yolo_: "web-related" was a bit vague. i assume you meant "web-related" meaning uses web technologies
[19:47:49] <TDC> I tried poweroff but it doesn't seem to do anything

[22:39:57] <TheGuestMovie> I'm writing an onboarding guide for future members of my team, I already covered the programming side, now I need to write something that basically guides them in learning Linux basics. Anyone have a link to a good series of tutorials that starts slow and gently turns them into decent Linux users, and doesn't focus on stuff the average user won't
[22:39:58] <TheGuestMovie> need much? I don't want them to start from scratch (Linux From Scratch), learn about the boot process, become Red Hat certs, etc, which is what all my search results is getting me. I want the 20% of knowledge that will cover 80% of their interactions with Linux. Here's what I had written before thinking I should link to a guided tutorial instead:

The examples could be sourced from external databases like
[22:55:42] <TheGuestMovie> cheat.sh/rsync. But so far I think
