[07:20:38] <sla[m]12> * for 2nd largest number we can probably run a for loop to find thelargest number and a 2nd one to find the number less than that, it would be faster than running n*n loops and sorting

[09:21:47] <NeoVoid[m]> Its spooky much kinds of data telegram collects.
[09:45:51] <labrador> well NeoVoid[m] it is a centralized proprietary service. No idea why people think it would be that different to whatsapp or something.
[09:48:01] <labrador> Though I'm a little biased against it too NeoVoid[m] cuz my peers recently discovered telegram and shitty pirated copies of movies and think they're cool whereas when I told them about my setup they bullied me for being a "nerd"
[10:19:05] <relejek[m]> labrador:  they're just jealous of so much "brains" you got. let Luddites be Luddites 
[11:06:30] <NeoVoid[m]> <labrador> "Though I'm a little biased..." <- when they call you nerd accept it as a compliment. 
[11:06:30] <NeoVoid[m]> and thank them. 
[11:06:30] <NeoVoid[m]> as a being a nerd is way much respect than being lazy ass consumerist.
[11:06:39] <AryaK[m]> +1
[11:06:50] <AryaK[m]> Neo Void: how is ement
[11:07:07] <AryaK[m]> i have been gomuks for quite a while now but i am having a shitload of issues with it

[21:45:54] <proffapt[m]> hehe
[21:46:42] <proffapt[m]> AryaK[m]: this guy is using matrix after 2 years
[21:47:29] <proffapt[m]> there is a huge delay of message being bridged.. it's like more than 20 seconds
[21:51:35] <AryaK[m]> oh really
[21:51:46] <AryaK[m]> i think we should host our own bridge lol
[21:52:03] <labrador> AryaK[m], would be too expensive
[21:52:09] <labrador> Matrix eats ram like crazy
[21:52:13] <proffapt[m]> hell lot
[21:52:17] <labrador> It is webshit after all...
[22:08:33] <AryaK[m]> <labrador> "Matrix eats ram like crazy" <- i had a sole matrox homeserver
[22:08:40] <AryaK[m]> other than network usage
[22:08:47] <AryaK[m]> it wasnt too bad
[22:09:13] <AryaK[m]> like 1.2 gigs ram and  not that much cpu
[22:09:52] <labrador> AryaK[m], I dunno man I never hosted my own. I'm just putting statements based on stuff I read. Like synapse taking 3+gb of ram and 80+gb db for like 10 users.
[22:11:17] <AryaK[m]> labrador: holy
[22:11:27] <AryaK[m]> i was in easily 100 rooms lol
[22:11:34] <AryaK[m]> and it wasnt too bad
[22:11:58] <labrador> AryaK[m], also 1.2gb for one user isn't good...ejabberd can easily take 200mb for that
[22:14:02] <AryaK[m]> labrador: it was alwayd 1.2 gigs
[22:14:08] <AryaK[m]> so ig its pytyon
[22:14:16] <AryaK[m]> next time i host i will prob use dendrite
[22:15:07] <labrador> AryaK[m], dendrite is unfinished
[22:15:21] <labrador> Also join #linux we're having a nice discussion about low level stuff there
[22:15:34] <labrador> Actually not a discussion...its mostly me asking stuff from rbox
[22:18:58] <AryaK[m]> labrador: most features are implemented
[22:19:02] <AryaK[m]> including appservicr
[22:19:07] <AryaK[m]> so bridges should work
[22:21:09] <labrador> AryaK[m], I think a list of things not implemented would be a better idea
[22:23:12] <labrador> AryaK[m], low level stuff is hard isn't it...calling conventions make my head spin
[22:27:32] <AryaK[m]> they have a todo list
[22:27:46] <AryaK[m]> last time i checked most important features are implemented
[22:27:56] <labrador> oh then should be gtg then!

[22:56:08] <NeoVoid[m]> who says foss projects are not funded
[22:58:10] <relejek[m]> Neo Void:  I do. for the many numbers of projects that need it there are only few that do get it.
