[15:35:11] <Kiernian|Work> anyone know what particular android app reaches out to these three (and only these three) hosts for torrent traffic? Getting some truly annoying firewall alerts but I can't figure out which app is causing it. No apparent torrent clients installed from what I can see. 3.15.110.209:10050
[15:35:11] <Kiernian|Work> ,   8.189.183.25:10050,
[15:35:11] <Kiernian|Work> 52.15.167.109:10050
[15:35:33] <Kiernian|Work> apologies for the crlf in there.
[15:49:24] <The_8472> Two of those IPs are AWS, the 2nd one is alicloud. also, how are you sure it's torrent traffic if it's only 3 IPs? I'd expect way more random IPs for normal torrent use
[15:49:37] <The_8472> although it's possible that an application uses the torrent protocol for 1:1 transfers
[15:51:20] <Kiernian|Work> it's blocked, so my guess is it's trying to phone in to start the actual torrenting and can't because it doesn't get to any of the target IP addresses
[15:51:54] <Kiernian|Work> interesting that the second one was alicloud. I was seeing all three as AWS containers
[15:53:38] <Kiernian|Work> I'm *probably* 90%-95% sure it's torrent technology for the traffic. I've seen a few false positives, but the IPS is generally pretty refined on this.
[15:53:45] <Kiernian|Work> Threat Management Alert 1: Potential Corporate Privacy Violation. Signature ET P2P ThunderNetwork UDP Traffic. From: 192.168.99.136:48820, to: 3.15.110.209:10050, protocol: UDP
[15:54:41] <The_8472> thunder is a chinese p2p client, torrenting is only one of its functions
[15:54:54] <Kiernian|Work> yup, and several months running and it only tries to hit those three.
[15:56:07] <Kiernian|Work> so I figure it's got to be trying to do something else and just torrenting as part of the process, but it was weird enough that I figured I'd see if it was familiar to the protocol experts, because the networking experts long since threw their hands up
[15:59:40] <The_8472> genshin impact is a fairly popular mobile game that seems to use it (according to random internet comments), maybe to download updates.
