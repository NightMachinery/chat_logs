[00:39:20] <blackfield> i've found two rather similar theorems: 1.finite affine plane of order n exists if and only if a complete set of mutually orthogonal latin squares of order n exists (for n>=2, a set of n-1 MOLS of order n is said to be a complete set of MOLS of order n), 2.For n>=2, finite projective plane of order n exists if and only if there exists n-1 mutually orthogonal latin quares of order n. Are both really true? in addition, i'd like to know whether
[00:39:20] <blackfield> projective plane of order 10 has been shown not to exist? thank you very much

[01:26:48] <alphamul2> Funny enough, the Sieve is a perfect application of such machines.

[01:28:02] <alphamul2> Filtered until you have only 2
[01:28:09] <alphamul2> Thus prime
[01:34:08] <joel135> alphamul2: you should try factoring (x^n-1). it is a similar problem.
[01:36:09] <alphamul2> Other issue with older machines
[01:36:14] <alphamul2> Enjoy your error-checking
[01:36:18] <alphamul2> By hand
[01:36:37] <buster> joel135, it is? easiest to start by knowing the answer, right?
[01:36:58] <alphamul2> At least with small primes it's easy to exhaust possible factors.
[01:37:10] <alphamul2> sqrt(n)
[01:37:44] <alphamul2> If I wanted ot find out if 9999 is a prime
[01:37:50] <buster> that projective-plane paper has a section worrying about single event upsets (though it doesn't use the term)
[01:37:58] <joel135> buster: do you mean it seems easier to me than it really is because i have seen the solution before?
[01:38:22] <alphamul2> The naive and lazy way is just divide it by 2,3,5,7,11,... all the way up 97.
[01:38:23] <int-e> joel135: let's pick a convenient domain... x^n - 1 = product[i=1 to n] (x - e^(2pi i/n))
[01:39:03] <joel135> let's pick Z[x]
[01:39:05] <buster> that's one form of the answer I was thinking of; the other was the real numbers, xⁿ-1=(x-1)s, where s is the sum of a certain geometric series
[01:39:08] <alphamul2> Or notice that it's 9 times 1111 :D
[01:40:04] <buster> uh, well that's true in any field (any ring?)  i guess
[01:40:05] <joel135> right buster, for each factor of n you obtain a factor of x^n-1 by a geometric series thing
[01:40:26] <alphamul2> Have your students prove that every integer created from just 9's is non-prime.
[01:40:39] <joel135> but the sieve idea extends as well...
[01:40:47] <alphamul2> If they fail, you fail
[01:40:57] <buster> i think of that as the 'proof' (rather, mnemonic) for the sum of a finite geometric series
[01:41:11] <int-e> joel135: I like cyclotomic polynomials, but not computing them by hand.
[01:41:32] <int-e> joel135: Let's pick this for n: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers#RSA-2048 ;-)
[01:41:48] <alphamul2> A nice, elagant one:  Multiply 1*9, 11*9, etc. and observe an inductive relationship.
[01:41:58] <alphamul2> It exhausts all possible number of 9's
[01:42:10] <alphamul2> Because the count is identical for 1's and 9's
[01:42:19] <alphamul2> Or variant:  Rule of 9's
[01:42:20] <buster> i never understood long division until i learned it for polynomials in my first term as an undergraduate. it's conceptually (if not practically) fun.
[01:42:23] <alphamul2> Like in accounting
[01:42:38] <alphamul2> LD just ... clicked for me
[01:43:29] <alphamul2> Their explanation didn't go to low enough level I guess, is way to describe it.  Then I suddenly got it.
[01:43:40] <alphamul2> Was almost annoyed but wass too happy to care.
[01:43:43] <joel135> i don't really like computing by hand either, unless it is easy enough to fit on a single page, or unless the 'computation' is actually a bunch of creative drawings. i more like looking at what my computer spits out.
[01:44:15] <alphamul2> Imagine not explaining that i's actually subtracting the multiples
[01:44:28] <alphamul2> And THAT's the remainder part.  Ugh
[01:44:33] <buster> alphamul2, do you program?
[01:44:38] <alphamul2> I have.
[01:44:42] <alphamul2> Most in here have
[01:45:00] <alphamul2> Polynomials is just a more general LD method
[01:45:12] <alphamul2> I mean, you can repalce it with anything.  Not just integers
[01:45:28] <joel135> int-e: hehe ;-)
[01:45:39] <alphamul2> If you had a mapping, you could do long division of colors
[01:45:46] <alphamul2> Sounds, whatever
[01:46:03] <alphamul2> Not that it'd make sense XD
[01:46:06] <buster> here's a fun exercise: (i) write a function to find the result of integer division a/b by binary search; (ii) write a function to calculate the integer division a/b by long division in binary; (iii) observe that you just wrote two textually identical functions
[01:46:45] <alphamul2> lol

[03:27:09] <buster> Let v be an eigenvector of AB with eigenvalue c. Prove BA has an eigenvector with eigenvalue c.
[03:27:11] <buster> Easy case (c != 0): we have (AB-c)v=0; left multiply by B to get (BA-c)Bv=0; and Bv != 0 since ABv != 0, so Bv is an eigenvector of BA with eigenvalue c.
[03:27:18] <buster> Harder case (c = 0): Note if Av=0 then ABv=BAv=0, so B(ker A) ⊆ ker A; similarly A(ker B) ⊆ ker B. But either A or B is singular since ABv=0; if A is singular let w ∈ ker A - {0}; then Bw ∈ ker A also; so ABw=BAw=0. Similarly if B is singular.

[05:36:14] <newpy> so if we just want to know the # of balls in each cell, ie. r_1 + ... + r_k = r (and each r_i tells you how many balls are in cell i)
[05:36:30] <newpy> oh I see my confusion
[05:37:03] <cherim> That would mean "balls are indistinguishable"

[06:00:57] <Fangs> Linear Analysis Book by Béla Bollobás
[06:01:15] <laurus> buster: Really okay, looking at your link now
[06:01:20] <Fangs> laurus: thats the book someone gave me years ago when I was taking a course in linear analysis
[06:01:57] <buster> that 'logical difficulty' is why we have the word "refinement" instead of just saying "subset"

[06:06:30] <Fangs> laurus: I think so. I've heard the term functional analysis but ive almost never heard the term linear analysis
[06:07:00] <Z-module> and being continuously isomorphic to R^n certainly gives you that all subspaces are closed and all closed balls are compact

[06:15:07] <Z-module> that link is weird, buster: even allowing improper coverings (where sets with different indices can be the same set), it's still the case that a space is compact if every open covering has a finite subcovering, and hausdorff has nothing to do with it.
[06:15:44] <Z-module> Is this from one of those much older books where what we would call compact non-hausdorff, they call quasicompact?
[06:17:27] <Z-module> I also like the weird Dugundji-exercise:  A space is compact iff every open covering has a minimal subcovering.  Minimal means: omitting any single set from the subcovering yields a non-covering.
[06:18:18] <buster> I don't think it's saying that Hausdorff has anything to do with it
[06:18:41] <Z-module> well, he only seems interested in the hausdorff case

[09:22:21] <genoobie> hey all!  I read a bit of math that said something like, The chance of getting exactly 50 heads and 50 tails in 100 flips is 1 in 12.
[09:22:36] <genoobie> any chance someone have a link to shed some light on this calc?
[09:22:51] <somiaj> Binomial Distribution (assuming a 50/50 chance for heads and tails)
[09:23:03] <somiaj> Basically it is C(100,50) * (1/2)^50 * (1/2)^50

[09:23:50] <somiaj> Though I don't get 1 in 12.
[09:24:09] <somiaj> I get close, but not exactly 1 in 12.
[09:24:45] <somiaj> genoobie: note, I gave you the probablity not the odds, you'll have to change that to odds (or change 1 in 12 to probablity) to compare
[09:25:33] <genoobie> Also good to know that it's not exactly 1 in 12.  I was wondering about the author's assertion.
[09:25:39] <genoobie> seemed too exact

[09:46:53] <cherim> Or probably not. In any case, why doesn't the 1/(sqrt(2Pi*100)) work?
[09:47:01] <somiaj> In that case you get int( 1/(5*sqrt(2*Pi)) * exp(-1/2 * ( (x-50)/5 )^2), x=49.5..50.5 ) = 0.07965567455 which is quite close to 0.07958923739
[09:48:14] <somiaj> in your case (despite your shift back to zero), your standard devition or variance estimate is not correct.
[09:48:42] <cherim> x_{n+1} = x_n + 1 or x_{n+1} = x_n - 1 with equal probability
[09:49:07] <cherim> <x_{n+1}^2> = <x_n^2> + 1, mean square equals n
[09:49:26] <somiaj> but if you fix your variance you end up with a rougher estimate of 1/sqrt(2*Pi*25) which is approx 0.07978845605

[20:37:56] <johnkeats6> idk
[20:38:14] <laurus> I sometimes do the prime numbered problems, maybe I will just do that with this if I get it
[20:38:35] <johnkeats6> i look at problems and decide which ones look interesting to me
[20:38:59] <laurus> I often can't really judge which ones are "important"
[20:39:11] <Z-module> (another nice way to think about O-O not =~ 8 : only the first space has two disjoint subsets each  =~ O )
[20:39:14] <river> i decided that i like papa flamy
[20:39:17] <laurus> So I try to see if there is a syllabus available for a course that uses the book, but a lot of times there aren't.
[20:39:31] <river> he's kind of insane but the integrals are good
[20:39:42] <johnkeats6> there's also an interesting book by Korner on Fourier Analysis that's highly regarded. but it's much more hardcore than Osgood
[20:40:05] <river> seconding Korner
[20:40:35] <laurus> I also see a book by  Elias Stein and Rami Shakarchi called _Fourier Analysis_, is that good?
[20:40:52] <johnkeats6> it's probably decent, their books are good
[20:41:20] <laurus> Thanks for the recommendations johnkeats6, river
[20:41:27] <johnkeats6> i'm pretty sure Osgood is the friendliest out of all of these. but it's geared at applications, so if you're interested in pure math idk if it'll fit

[20:42:27] <laurus> johnkeats6: I am actually probably more interested in applying this particular topic, but I usually try to fit things into a theoretical "lineage"
[20:42:39] <laurus> So sometimes I worry about the question "is this general enough"
[20:42:49] *** Quits: cheater (~Username@user/cheater) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[20:43:08] <laurus> Like for example this topology book I have has a kind of generalization of the implicit and inverse function theorems from the way I had seen them before that were R^n specific, and I think that's cool
[20:43:21] <laurus> So I want to know the general version in that case. This Fourier thing I imagine might be similar
[20:43:23] <river> you dont always need or want full generality
[20:43:34] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[20:43:46] <river> learning math is iterative, sometimes generalized stuff doesn't even make sense until you've done some concrete examples
[20:44:03] <Franciman> +1 river
[20:44:12] <Franciman> that's why bourbaki is the worst
[20:44:27] <Franciman> they didn't understand the smallest thing about the nature of our understanding of mathematics
[20:45:03] <Franciman> so infinitely stupid
[20:45:18] <dextaa> unlike papa flammy
[20:46:40] <river> i don't know why i never saw that digamma was connected to Gamma...
