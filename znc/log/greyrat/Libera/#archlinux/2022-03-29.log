[05:40:07] <phrik> Title: FS#67865 : Download progress not shown when using Cloudflare mirrors (at bugs.archlinux.org)
[05:40:17] <Edu4rdSHL> This isn't strictly a mirror but a proxy that caches the packages from other mirrors and then serve it to you, however it's damn good to be honest.

[05:40:48] <mattf> can i add that mirror to reflector
[05:40:50] <Edu4rdSHL> Namarrgon, it doesn't :(
[05:41:02] <Namarrgon> mattf: do you know how to edit the mirrorlist?
[05:41:12] <mattf> yes  but i have reflector timer systemd running

[05:41:32] <Edu4rdSHL> mattf, honestly just put the cloudflare thing and you don't need any other mirror

[05:43:25] <Edu4rdSHL> Namarrgon, is the cloudflare mirror "officially recognized"? I mean, it isn't added to the mirrorlist, not even sure if it's supported or not
[05:43:36] *** Joins: LogicAside (~LogicAsid@user/logicaside)
[05:44:48] <Namarrgon> is it listed on the homepage?
[05:44:54] <Namarrgon> arch does not "support" any of the mirrors, they are run by third-parties

[05:46:59] <mattf> ooooh
[05:47:04] <mattf> how annoying
[05:47:05] <mattf> :P
[05:47:17] <Edu4rdSHL> Namarrgon, it isn't listed on https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/, that's why I was asking
[05:47:31] <Edu4rdSHL> mattf, I see low download speeds more annoying :p

[05:54:30] <mpan> Arsimael: considering that I gave that with ±25% error margin, it doesn’t matter if it’s GiB or GB.
[05:54:31] <demonicmaniac1> naw
[05:54:38] <demonicmaniac1> multilib is comparatively tiny
[05:55:01] <Arsimael> It's still next to nothing.
[05:55:22] <Arsimael> In that case I wouls rather create my own mirror instead of useing cloudflare...

[09:06:19] <cyphertite> thanks mpan - understood
[09:06:37] <mpan> Do not expect consistency of testing repos on the same level as the “stable” ones.
[09:07:29] <mpan> Some minor mistakes happen even in the latter. Like the recent ffmpeg slipping from staging.
[09:08:18] <cyphertite> sure, but I only rarely experience issues, and when I do I always learn something after discussing them

[12:06:02] <mpan> sudo can be configured through the sudoers file and you may give fine-tuned permissions to anyone having access to sudo. In this sense it is not the same as someone having root. But if you give them right to use a command as a root they will run that with elevated privileges. And through that command they hypothetically may escalate their access.

[16:06:15] <pagios> i need to be able to remotely control a pc when it boots via usb. For example, when you pluyg a usb, you get to the boot prompt where you can load ISOs or whatever. at this stage i want to be able to dynamically get Isos for example (clamAV OS to boot and clean viruses remotely) or clonezilla to remotely backup data etc, so each is an iso and i need to load them dynamically via my remote session which should be at boot level before a given
[16:06:15] <pagios>  iso is loaded

[16:09:02] <pagios> they are set 
[16:09:23] <HuntsMan> but you have to be in front of the machine to do that
[16:11:09] <rcf> If they will need to interact, using a menu to select the basic thing you want them to do is probably the best approach.

[16:13:49] <rcf> There is a reason servers include fancy lights-out management functionality, after all. Suppose you boot into whatever you're going to boot into -- how are you going to maintain control?

[16:27:56] <rcf> The problem is in the 'get a shell'. You need to configure the ISO such that it initiates the connection.

[18:26:56] <bin> that was my first thought as well
[18:28:04] <SysGhost> Could be the sleep failed and caused a forced reboot at wakeup. Not too uncommon with bad RAM settings.

[18:28:36] <MacGyver> I've never seen a failing suspend causing a forced reboot without first waking up to a black screen.
[18:29:05] <SysGhost> sleep works as intended. But upon the wakeup event, computer notices corrupt content in RAM.
[18:30:47] <SysGhost> ...and when the kernel itself can't run at all, computer goes into a forced reset.
[18:30:56] <SysGhost> i.e.a reboot

[18:38:27] <SysGhost> aha... could it be a failed suspend to disk?
[18:38:28] *** Joins: Mred (~Mred@41.169.71.82)
[18:39:05] <bin> hmm maybe. i just closed the lid and usually that works fine, vs running systemctl suspend. i'll have to do some more testing
[18:39:38] <bin> whats odd is i just moved 1500 miles with it in sleep mode and it recovered just fine after a few days of sleeping
[18:39:45] <bin> so maybe just something with a second sleep
[18:39:55] *** Quits: Mred (~Mred@41.169.71.82) (Client Quit)
[18:39:57] <SysGhost> I had that behaviour myself after incorrect configuration of the suspend partition UUID. looked like a full suspend2disk and a proper shutdown. resuming failed with a quick "failed to resume, rebooting" and a normal boot followed.

[18:44:00] <bin> yeah
[18:44:01] <MacGyver> Also that's not "suspend".
[18:44:11] <bin> my thinking is something just went wrong with the sleep cycle
[18:44:15] <bin> and it silently powered down
[18:44:36] <MacGyver> I could look up the exact log message for a suspend to disk but I think it's hibernate or suspend-and-hibernate that's logged if you do that.
[18:44:37] <bin> i just wanted to make sure there wasnt another log i should be checking
[18:44:49] <MacGyver> bin: My point is that that doesn't usually happen.

[21:37:19] <pc8989> Let me ask you a question about the renaming the source file to avoid checksum mismatch at update. I dont't control the source URL and the file name. I'm not the author.
[21:37:32] <Hello71> it has nothing to do with whether the makefile is written well. make simply cannot represent paths with spaces. if your makefile does not use any absolute paths, this may not be an issue, but if for example you do ../path with spaces/configure, it is fundamentally impossible to write a standard makefile that references paths there. you can't even use VPATH because it "is separated by colons or
[21:37:35] <Hello71> blanks"

[23:04:49] <johnplosky> does anyone use slock? I find it unreliable on a laptop when suspending (I configured xfce to lock when suspending). sometimes it locks, other times it doesn't, other times it completely locks the system (not sure if related to slock), so I can't even change the tty. anyone has any idea of this?

[23:09:04] <drathir_tor> johnplosky: no idea if slck integrate well with xfce but You can check settings>session and startup and there lock screen before sleep... also You can replace xfce one with xscreensaver... in some cases of locks good to try completly remove xfce4-screensaver...

[23:54:19] <Fichte> hey, I have a problem with a 'premature end of file /boot/vmlinuz-linux' on boot. I have tried restoring three different kernel versions via archiso and rerunning mkinitcpio manually after each to no avail. Any ideas? 
[23:54:26] <Fichte> bootloader is grub
[23:56:01] *** Joins: conr (~conr@user/conr)
[23:56:04] <conr> any idea why i just did a q-flash to my gigabyte x570 mobo and now arch won't boot because it's not found? 
[23:56:28] <MrElendig> conr: boot install image, add a new nvram entry
[23:56:57] <MrElendig> and for the future: install the bootloader to the default load path (grub-install --removable if you use grub)
[23:57:34] <MrElendig> don't forget to fix the secureboot/csm settings etc which most likely also got reset
[23:57:35] *** Joins: mtn (~mtn@98.97.127.52)
[23:57:44] <Edu4rdSHL> Fichte, looks like that your system upgrade was interrupted at some point and probably the kernel presets got removed, so mkinitcpio is doing nothing.
[23:57:50] <MrElendig> and that the sata controller is in the correct mode if you use sata
[23:58:02] <conr> MrElendig: how do i do it if i can't load the OS? boot cli?

[23:58:15] <MrElendig> same way as when you installed arch in the first place?
[23:58:39] <conr> i forgot, via usb?
[23:58:44] <MrElendig> if you do have your bootloader in the default boot path, mashing f8 or whatever during boot should work
