[00:51:00] <t4nk_freenode> heh, yeah... funny.. it opens a dialog, but it disappears on its own.. and although 'cancel' is the first button, if you don't intervene it will save the bookmark anyhow without clicking save
[00:54:42] <susi> disappears?
[00:54:55] <susi> does not disappear for me, and why would it

[00:55:28] <t4nk_freenode> it does here
[00:55:47] <t4nk_freenode> after a second or two or so
[00:56:29] <t4nk_freenode> it only stays if you ctrl-d on a page which is already bookmarked
[00:57:03] <susi> what if you press ctrl-s, does that dialog disappear too?
[00:57:06] <susi> or all the other dialogs
[00:57:13] <susi> that's not normal behavior
[00:57:39] <t4nk_freenode> no, but I'm just telling it like it is on my end
[00:58:20] <t4nk_freenode> also, the bookmark dialog seems like a different class of dialog from e.g a save dialog
[00:58:47] <t4nk_freenode> no minimize or close buttons for example
[00:59:29] <susi> yeps
[00:59:56] <susi> if you click on hamburger menu button on firefox, does it disappear too?
[01:00:11] <susi> I mean the one in the right corner, with preferences, quit etc
[01:01:19] <t4nk_freenode> yeah, I know, nope, it seems to stay, though both dialogs disappear when I alt-tab away
[01:01:52] <susi> I'd investigate why it disappears if you have not done anything for it to work that way
[01:02:28] <t4nk_freenode> I'd say it's kind of strange in the bookmarks case...
[01:02:48] <t4nk_freenode> maybe it's some setting, or in about:config
[01:05:08] <t4nk_freenode> "In the early days of this panel, some users reported it would display briefly and then close itself before the 4 seconds or so that it is supposed to remain open if you don't interact with it, or even after they started interacting with it."
[01:08:03] <susi> definitely not a setting or anything, it wouldn't work that way (display, but only for 2 secs, and then disappear even if user was interacting)
[01:08:49] <t4nk_freenode> (it won't disappear for me when i'm interacting though)

[01:11:27] <ede> t4nk_freenode: just as an example, noscript's per page settings (not the main settings) is the same method. hangs down from the button, no idea what it actually is, probably some web technology monstrosity.
[01:12:33] <ede> so when i actually want to bookmark something i press C-d and the moment it appears i tab. just to keep it open.....
[01:12:57] <susi> and you dont know why it works that way?
[01:13:37] <susi> it has never worked that way for me, and I have never edited any setting related to bookmarking dialogs
[01:13:49] <t4nk_freenode> the bookmarks thing appears to be deliberately put in place so it seems
[01:14:15] <t4nk_freenode> but auto-confirming doesn't seem right to me

Then more and more webpages don't render correct anymore in PM. From the functionality point of view and Addons I was happy with PM, now going to make Firefox working the same way...
[11:40:34] <Mo> Caspy7[m]: I'm back on 91.7.0esr, because default 98.0 was not able to use unsigned addons, and the developer version was too new for my Tab Mix Plus addon that supports up to 94.

[11:46:38] <Mo> btw. is eenabling recommended? https://wiki.mozilla.org/Project_Fission#Enabling_Fission
[11:47:03] <Caspy7[m]> Mo: the deal is that electrolysis split the browser into a parent process and content processes, then Fission dropped that to Parent and a process for each "origin" (so many more)

[11:57:52] <Caspy7[m]> ok, so the default is 8, that should be enough to use your cores
[11:57:52] <Caspy7[m]> that being said, Electrolysis now includes more than just parent and content processes. There's other's like one for media iirc.
[11:58:00] <Caspy7[m]> *others
[11:58:07] <Mo> ok
[11:58:33] <Mo> I guess that default 8 cames from testing the current core count on the machine, could be 4 on a 4-core machine.
[12:01:35] <Caspy7[m]> Mo: I think for the most part 8 was default for everyone by that point (I *think*)
[12:02:50] <Caspy7[m]> at one point they may have based it on memory, but I think they got per-process memory overhead down enough to make it 8 for everyone but the worst hardware
[12:04:15] <Caspy7[m]> lots of engineering time has been invested to morph Firefox from monolithic, single process, to multiprocess to fission process-per-origin

[12:52:52] <Mo> Caspy7[m]: Ok, but beside that hovering a link, I can't customize the status bar any further?
[12:53:12] <Caspy7[m]> I don't believe so
[12:54:41] <Mo> About comments in .css files, how can I comment complete blocks, if there are already comments? Do nested comments work in CSS?
[12:54:57] <Mo> At least my vim syntax highlighting does not understand it.

[19:10:34] <nemo> they suggest turning it on once, syncing, then turning it off again

[21:08:13] <jensen> Caspy7: my workflow involves using many profiles with wrapper script with firefox running in a sandbox (firejail). it copies the files so that they share the same settings: prefs.js extension-preferences.json extension-settings.json extensions.json addonStartup.json.lz4. And the directories: chrome,browser-extension-data,extensions. i'm curious if these files are at least profile-agnostic (i.e. do
[21:08:15] <jensen> not contain any profile-specific data). everything works as expected except extension settings are not copied and on first run of the profile it is as if extensions are auto-installed, asks for permissions, and their settings in a clean slate

[22:33:42] <susi> it's a good user.js, but I thought you tried a fresh profile?
[22:35:15] <susi> arkenfox user.js usualyl requires you to put something in your user-overrides.js to make it usable
[22:35:47] <susi> this is my user-overrides.js, just as an example: https://paste.rs/RZv
[22:36:06] <susi> privacy.resistFingerprinting.letterboxing for example is something not many actually want to set true
[22:37:08] <susi> and people watching netflix and such want to set media.eme.enabled to true to allow DRM
[22:39:18] <mizzunet> > I thought you tried a fresh profile?
[22:39:18] <mizzunet> No, I used the same profile
[22:39:18] <mizzunet> Perhaps `perfCleaner` fixed
[22:41:01] <mizzunet> > privacy.resistFingerprinting.letterboxing for example is something not many actually want to set true7:
[22:41:01] <mizzunet> Actually I like it

[22:42:03] <susi> scales UI and website elements smaller
[22:42:34] <mizzunet> Is it good?
[22:42:48] <susi> always when you have problems with FF, try with a fresh profile, you can create one in about:profiles (or running firefox with --ProfileManager)
[22:43:00] <susi> it's good for me, I doubt it's anything you want to set
