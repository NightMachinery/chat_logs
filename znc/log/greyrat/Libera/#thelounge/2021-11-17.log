[00:07:56] <bookworm> c014: your node-gyp version wants python 2

[00:09:44] <c014> I dunno, I was just reaching for help
[00:11:04] <bookworm> ah, that wasn't an offense
[00:11:41] <c014> english is not my first language so I am struggling a bit :)
[00:11:49] <bookworm> your version literally doesn't support python3, which is strange as that means my arch package ain't doing what I think it does if we actually pin the version
[00:19:15] <bookworm> c014: for now, just install python2 (even if it's ugly...)
[00:19:21] <bookworm> that should solve your woes
[00:20:33] <c014> I tried that now.. and it fails to fins binaries for sqlite
[00:20:41] <bookworm> that's normal
[00:20:45] <bookworm> you are using a fringe distro

[00:39:16] <bookworm> MaxLeiter: we might end up switching sqlite packages after all... the thing seems horribly unmaintained: https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/pull/1441 while the security issues are addressed by updating they fail to publish a new version in any reasonable timeframe
[00:39:46] <bookworm> reported Feb9
[00:46:53] <bookworm> c014: it is indeed "our" fault... one of our deps uses the extremely old version that needs python 2 (and I mean extremely... 3.8 is pinned, current is 8.4)
[00:50:29] <bookworm> s/security issues/problems with old deps/ the security issue is just tar it looks like, which is a rather small thing considering that the input is semi trusted. But python2 is not really acceptable and breaks the build in various distros that stopped shipping it
[00:51:37] <xnaas> python2 will haunt us all as much as Windows XP, I'm sure :P
[00:52:00] <Activ8> wonder if we can get the lounge running on an xp desktop for the lulz

[17:29:22] <Activ8> just tried with a shortcut to the .bat as well but that doesn't start either.
[17:30:49] <Activ8> is there a reason why you don't run a schedule task on startup?
