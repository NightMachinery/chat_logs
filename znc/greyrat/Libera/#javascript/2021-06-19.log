[02:35:41] <entuland> of course if the other approaches are better, use those
[02:35:43] <wroathe> nedbat: The basic idea behind event delegation is that you bind a single event listener to a common ancestor of all of the elements you want to handle the event for, and rely on the fact that events bubble up from target nodes to ancestor nodes
[02:36:13] <wroathe> nedbat: e.target will be the element that triggered the event, and .currentTarget will be the element the listener is bound to
[02:36:56] <wroathe> nedbat: So if mousedown is triggered an en element INSIDE of the element you want to drag, you'll use const dragging = e.target.closest('.draggable'); to find it
[02:37:33] <nedbat> wroathe: right, i have .closest(".draggable")
[02:38:00] <entuland> the only edit I did in your code is at lines 4 to 6
[02:38:07] <wroathe> nedbat: Yup. If that returns null (there's no ancestor draggable), then you just return without doing anything

[02:43:02] <banana_> was that it
[02:43:16] <nedbat> wroathe: ok, that's the kind of thing a newb like me wouldn't know :)
[02:43:19] <wroathe> nedbat: I shared an example helper for doing this a few days ago: https://gist.github.com/JustinChristensen/652bedadc92cf0aff86cc5fbcde87732

[02:44:42] <nedbat> wroathe: help me understand why that is better than document.body.addEventListener("pointerdown", etc)
[02:44:44] <banana_> yo
[02:45:12] <banana_> real question about why clientX and clientY are 0 on some browers when you click an option element.
[02:45:17] <wroathe> nedbat: Well, the helper is just there for convenience, but the _technique_ of devent delgation is objectively better
[02:45:45] <wroathe> nedbat: Because you don't need to manage binding and rebinding event listeners for child elements as they're created/destroyed, or as they change states.
[02:46:01] <wroathe> nedbat: You just bind one event listener to a common ancestor, and handle events from the elements of interest
[02:46:07] <nedbat> wroathe: because the changing states will be expressed as classes that can change
[02:46:19] <entuland> banana_, what's the browser that does that on you?
[02:46:23] <wroathe> nedbat: huh?
[02:46:30] <banana_> windows, mac is ok
[02:47:07] <entuland> okay, but which browser?
[02:47:08] <nedbat> wroathe: maybe i don't understand yet.  If I want an element to be draggable or not, instead of registering and deregistering listeners, how would this event delegation make that happen?
[02:47:14] <banana_> I was shocked when I saw that. I was relying on clientX and clientY to give me some coordinate
[02:47:30] <entuland> windows and mac are OSes, not browsers
[02:47:31] <banana_> besides 0,0

[02:48:15] <banana_> chrome. yeah but isnt the chrome windows and mac versions different builds?
[02:48:17] <nedbat> wroathe: ok, then i did understand: changing the eventiness of an element is done by changing its classes, so the delegation finds it or doesn't.
[02:48:34] <wroathe> nedbat: Indeed. But it's not limited to just classes. Any selector.
[02:48:59] <nedbat> wroathe: right. classes are the natural one for explicit changes to event sensitivity
[02:48:59] <entuland> sure, but you said "some browsers", you didn't specify chrome
[02:49:15] <wroathe> nedbat: Convinced? :P
[02:49:32] <entuland> I'm not sure you can rely on that on options inside selects, banana_, as those widgets are os-dependent
[02:49:46] <banana_> chrome on mac is fine but on windows the mouse click event type has 0 for clientX and clientY
[02:49:51] <banana_> it's odd
[02:49:58] <nedbat> wroathe: it's eye-opening :)

[03:03:32] <banana_> specifically it needs to toggle it's internal state when the user clicks outside of it, the component's element.
[03:03:58] <entuland> sorry, that's not going to help - we'd need to know the exact elements you're using, what the user does and what you want as a result - and possibly also _why_ you want such a result

[03:05:23] *** Quits: P1RATEZ (piratez@user/p1ratez) ()
[03:05:24] <banana_> it's a UX requirement to have this component have two states, one in edit mode and one in just read only mode.
[03:05:43] <banana_> there's a button in readonly mode that you can click to enter edit mode. and there's a drop down.
[03:05:50] <wroathe> nedbat: Sorry, had to step away for a bit
[03:06:24] <banana_> and when you select something in the dropdown and click submit (a submit button also in the component) you can change the state of the app.
[03:06:27] <wroathe> nedbat: The key is when you call preventDefault in the handler
[03:06:45] <banana_> and then once the app state saves it goes back to read only mode.
[03:06:52] <wroathe> nedbat: You only want to preventDefault if the target is an element within the draggable container that should be allowed to initiate the drag
[03:07:05] <wroathe> nedbat: Otherwise you want the pointerdown/mousedown event to proceed normally, because they've clicked the input
[03:07:08] <nedbat> wroathe: ok, so the delegation doesn't solve the input-in-the-draggable problem.
[03:07:33] <banana_> idk I think I'm building the component right
[03:07:40] <wroathe> nedbat: Yup. I was only suggesting it as a general improvement to what you're doing. The specific problem you have is a much easier fix.
[03:07:55] <entuland> banana_, may help if you shared your code so that we could see it in action
[03:07:58] <banana_> I'm literally puzzled why when you click the option tag it gives you 0 for clientX and clientY https://jsfiddle.net/1bryLxc4/2/
[03:08:01] <nedbat> wroathe: i appreciate the larger perspective.  i'm not used to writing this style of code.
[03:08:20] <entuland> banana_, don't get me wrong, it just feels like an XY problem
[03:08:33] <entuland> your problem may be relying on clientX and clientY to begin with
[03:08:38] <banana_> it's a work project can't care it but I recreated the event listener in the jsfiddle
[03:08:58] <wroathe> nedbat: e => { if (!e.target.matches('input')) { e.preventDefault(); // handle dragging logic } }
[03:09:05] <entuland> we've confirmed that what you want there already fails, banana_
[03:09:05] <banana_> entuland: so what's your suggestion if youre tracking where the user clicks their mouse?
[03:09:32] <wroathe> nedbat: The idea is that you want mouse/pointerdown to proceed normally if the target is the input
[03:09:44] <nedbat> wroathe: yes, and that works, thanks

[03:37:23] <banana_> but I think you can assume based on certain knowledge
[03:38:03] <banana_> if IOS has the select outside the window do those  clicks trigger the click event type?
[03:38:07] <entuland> if I got your purpose right (just detecting an active click _in_ your page _outside_ of a particular branch of the DOM, then you should be okay
[03:39:06] <banana_> like if you click outside the browser window for any reasons you shouldnt trigger a click event type
[03:39:06] <entuland> that specific query I can't tell, but if the select is _outside_ of the other branch you need to detect the loss of focus, then the activation of the select itself would trigger your code
[03:39:20] <entuland> yes, clicking outside shouldn't trigger that code
[03:39:41] <entuland> clicking _outside_ of the page
[03:39:57] <banana_> so if a select dropdown bleeds over the browser window then those clicks outside the browser window would trigger a click event
[03:39:58] <entuland> screwed the underlines
[03:40:07] <banana_> *woulddnt
[03:40:23] <banana_> ok then I think we're fine.
[03:40:35] <entuland> yes, the click should be raised because the dropdown would count as page content
[03:40:41] <banana_> and honestly if we aren't I'm sure someone will file a bug.
[03:41:06] <banana_> idk this project isn't like high stakes but I might pass on that info to my UX person.
[03:41:24] <banana_> entuland really?
[03:41:29] <banana_> damn I want to test that.
[03:41:37] <entuland> I think the most dubious thing here (for the lack of data) is your actual usecase, I still am not sure whether you have multiple areas with multiple selects all over the place or so
[03:41:48] <banana_> I tested it with IOS and nah it doesnt trigger the event
[03:43:01] <banana_> is there a mobile friendly fiddle or is this a dumb way to test on iOS XD
[03:43:18] <entuland> nothing beats testing on the real devices
[03:43:53] <entuland> one thing is for sure, you _will_ get a chance to detect the click on a select, can't be 100% sure you'll be able to detect the click on one of the options on all, but if I got your scenario correctly, detecting the click on the select should be enough

[03:45:51] <banana_> yeah im going to use event.target basically
[03:45:55] <banana_> that should be good.
[03:46:01] <entuland> but you have selects with no valid options, so not sure there either
[03:46:35] <banana_> yeah that's not a usecase there will be at least intended option in order to show the dropdown.
[03:46:41] <banana_> the <select> tag

[03:49:15] <entuland> on windows chrome you get the click event on the select (opening the dropdown) but no click event clicking on any of those disabled options: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/jygh7nem/1/
[03:49:51] <banana_> nah, in that case the BE wouldnt not provided any available options and our app's component would keep the component in the readonly state
[03:50:00] <entuland> good
[03:50:17] <entuland> as you can see, there are many ways to interpret verbal explanations of the code
[03:50:27] <entuland> seeing the actual code is always better :P
[03:50:53] <banana_> it's a little screwy because the component can toggle it's own state afair
[03:51:32] <entuland> yep you can do a lot of nasty things depending on how you design your system
[03:51:37] <banana_> instead of event up data down. but that's because I had to make a bunch of stuff components and no one else did. because everyone sucks in my project.
[03:51:51] <banana_> i didnt say that
[03:51:54] <entuland> eheheh
[03:51:55] <banana_> haha.
[03:52:07] <entuland> well, for the way you wrote it, you included yourself in the bunch, so that's okay :P
[03:52:32] <banana_> basically im doing my project a solid because it's usually easy work and I have time to learn on the side. but right now i have to do a bunch of cleanup
[03:53:09] <entuland> dealing with other people's code is never boring :P
[03:53:14] <banana_> classism at its finest but it's ok if I learn a bit more I can land somewhere better.
[03:53:20] <entuland> my own code from one week ago counts as "other people's code"

[04:01:37] <entuland> don't worry, english is broken to begin with
[04:02:07] <foureyes> is it bad if you use the setVariableName naming convention for redux reducers if you're just mutating a single part of the state?
[04:02:07] <foureyes> is there a convention people use to distinguish them from useState dispatchers?
[04:02:54] <banana_> yeah but it's used by the classes to subjugate people. especially the corporate world. they pay you and you need money to live
[04:03:11] <banana_> so yeah working on that. also it's good to know more i guess.
[04:03:12] * entuland googles "redux reducers"
[04:03:48] <foureyes> for a moment I thought you meant that reducers are used by javascript classes to subjugate things 😆
[04:04:10] <banana_> haha sry getting off topic.
[04:04:33] <banana_> just be smart in this field if it's your career.
[04:04:33] <entuland> uhm... just so you know, Redux'ers may not be around here but they have a Discord server (just in case you don't find anyone around here to help you, foureyes)
[04:05:02] <foureyes> cool, thanks for reminding me about that, I just started refactoring with redux today
[04:05:15] <entuland> it's linked here: https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started#help-and-discussion
[04:05:29] <banana_> I heard mixed things about redux but may be ok if your case idk.
[04:05:35] <banana_> i've used it before.
[04:05:48] <banana_> i dont know the answer to your question though.
[04:06:13] <wroathe> foureyes: The answer to that isn't something IRC can tell you. That's a team decision.
[04:06:29] <wroathe> foureyes: The conventional convention is fooReducer, but if your team is cool with relaxing that then go ahead.
[04:06:45] <banana_> sounds like a general redux convention question.
[04:06:53] <foureyes> well I'm the lead on this, I was just wondering if there is a convention among the community
[04:07:04] <banana_> wroathe knows everything though. yeah listen to him srsly.
[04:07:07] <foureyes> wroathe: thanks
[04:07:09] <wroathe> foureyes: The reason people avoid imperative names for reducers like setFoo is because typically the action creators are more suitable for that
[04:07:09] <banana_> ^
[04:07:42] <wroathe> foureyes: so fooReducer handles updating the store for a setFoo action creator
[04:07:42] <foureyes> I am talking about the reducer section of createSlice
[04:07:58] <foureyes> those create the actions
[04:08:28] <banana_> even broke out the "imperative" mood knowledge right there. nice.
[04:08:30] <wroathe> foureyes: Ah. createSlice is a different story. In the situation you'd want setFoo.
[04:08:41] <banana_> grammar stuff. ok brb
[04:08:44] <foureyes> hurrah
[04:08:50] <foureyes> thought so :D
[04:09:48] <foureyes> so I'm actually following the right naming convention. I was finding it confusing distinguishing between setters in useState and action creators, but I refactored the whole state so it's grouped more intuitively now and hopefully it's clear
[04:10:30] <foureyes> I am also adding a .selectors property to my createSlice-returned object

[04:16:24] <banana_> yeah there was something related to this as well forgot though. Is there a general naming convention in programming.
[04:16:45] <banana_> like how does the react redux come up with their naming convention basically.
[04:16:49] <gehn> banana_, no
[04:17:16] <entuland> yep, there are wildly varying conventions around
[04:17:20] <gehn> there are naming conventions, but no universally accepted ones - it tends to probably become opinionated, subjective and flame prone

[04:17:46] <banana_> ok so like someone came up with actions and then someone else thought of an idea of keeping the naming of actions different from reducers.
[04:17:53] *** Joins: denza242 (~denza242@sapphire/support/denza242)
[04:17:53] <entuland> in some languages you can't apply certain naming conventions at all (not in a nice way anyways)

[04:17:59] <banana_> just like that from experience?
[04:18:07] <banana_> lol
[04:18:17] <gehn> I don't know about that wroathe
[04:18:28] <gehn> but I can agree that powershell naming conventions are literally the worst naming conventions
[04:18:29] <wroathe> gehn: The matter is closed, unfortunately
[04:18:40] <banana_> well I mean you're superior at coding than me for sure so whatever you say haha
[04:18:42] * gehn opens wroathe
[04:19:21] <entuland> some conventions may be dictated inside some contexts (the developers of a system / framework), some other conventions build up by agreement in a community or a team, and they may as such be very different even on projects using the same languages / libraries and so forth
[04:19:23] <gehn> banana_, the only convention that matters is that your convention is consistent
[04:19:24] <banana_> I'm trying to get better but not a coding animal like that. I like learning complicated shit though. that's how I hang in this field i think
[04:19:57] <gehn> banana_, if you want some complicated shit, naming conventions are maybe not the most ideal avenue of inquiry
[04:20:15] <gehn> try solving TSP on your own (I mean solving it well, not just solving it)
[04:20:26] <gehn> or write a software rasterizer and raycaster
[04:20:31] <banana_> gehn: that's my issue something for sure. for component events im pretty good adding an "on" prefix and the following verb is present tense. and then for the handler it's always past tense in my code at least.
[04:20:40] <banana_> *somtimes for sure.
[04:20:58] <entuland> there is quantum mechanics as well if you want complicated stuff :P
[04:21:07] <banana_> like onSubmit={{submitted}} or some crap.
[04:21:23] <gehn> or differential equations, which probably comes up in QM, I don't know I'm not a QM person
[04:21:37] <entuland> that looks like some templated stuff, banana_
[04:21:44] <entuland> nothing really complicated about that
[04:22:08] <banana_> that's how i do it even if submitted() { } in this case is invoked before the actual action of the submission. if that makes sense, i.e. the submitted() function invokes an ajax request.
[04:22:27] <entuland> not sure I like that
[04:22:43] <gehn> banana_, I tend to go with handleFoo, so like onSubmit=handleOnSubmit
[04:22:57] <gehn> it mostly doesn't matter thought, if its your code, you get to decide your own conventions
[04:23:14] <gehn> like I said a moment ago, the only real thing that matters is be consistent with whatever convention you choose
[04:23:16] <entuland> if AJAX fails there it's not submitted, I'd call "submitted" the callback to be executed after the submit was actually succesfull

[04:24:26] <banana_> gehn: yeah I noted down what you last suggested. I meant more like "complicated" relative to the ability of the people around me lol.
[04:24:31] <gehn> banana_, or better, try to use naming that's actually domain specific
[04:24:47] <gehn> onSubmit=createNewUser or onSubmit=saveProjectFile etc etc
[04:25:08] <wroathe> banana_: On the Redux thing... There's a larger general pattern there around mutating a data source and using imperative names with specific verbs to denoate mutating the data versus querying the data. Even events. For example, createUser, userCreated, getUser.
[04:25:10] <banana_> entuland yeah I know what whatever I'm a stickler about having handlers use past tenses. maybe that's stupid to do.
[04:25:13] <gehn> but like most things, which way you choose to go tends to just have pros and cons, there's no real right answer
[04:25:30] <entuland> if you and your team are fine with that, it may be okay
[04:25:53] <entuland> just feels wrong to me cause the past tense conveys something that's done, not something that is going to be done
[04:25:59] <wroathe> banana_: There's an architecture I've used in the past that models mutating the data store similar to Redux, but on a larger scale called CQRS with Event Sourcing
[04:26:00] <gehn> banana_, it is a little bit, when your handler is running it's not really a past tense type of situation
[04:26:08] <gehn> it's more "presently this is happening"
[04:26:10] <banana_> wroathe yeah put they're all in perfect tense right.
[04:26:17] <gehn> i.e. "presently the user wants to save or create or delete" etc
[04:26:23] <wroathe> banana_: CQRS stands for Command Query Response Segregation
[04:26:27] <gehn> i.e. "this is the action happening right now"
[04:27:18] <gehn> just because it was 150ms ago that the user clicked the submit button doesn't really mean that the requested behavior is a thing of the past
[04:28:19] <banana_> wroathe: ok so "userCreated" would be an event
[04:28:28] <banana_> event handler right
[04:28:37] <gehn> could be if you want
[04:28:46] *** Quits: tex (~super@user/dix) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[04:28:57] <gehn> but upon the entry (first line of) to the userCreated() function presumably the user has not actually yet been created
[04:29:07] <wroathe> banana_: An event generally, yes, because it's in the past tense
[04:29:08] <banana_> it's consistent with my component's event handler's then i.e. functions I pass to components that my component invoke at some point.
[04:29:11] <gehn> the way it sounds to me, the userCreated function is responsible for attempting to create the user
[04:29:19] <banana_> *my components invoke
[04:29:43] <entuland> userCreated as event happening after the creation, or userCreated() as the callback to be invoked after the creation, those look fine to me

[04:34:52] <wroathe> banana_: It's the same kind of idea as Redux, but applied to databases and the services around them
[04:35:00] <gehn> I'm sure plenty of books at least mention naming conventions, but I'm 99% sure there's no "book about naming conventions"
[04:35:09] <gehn> there are probably a million blog posts about the topic tho
[04:35:25] <banana_> because like when wroathe, for example, said "imperative" he meant imperative mood which is grammar related so communication like that requires a baseline grammar knowledge.
[04:35:43] <banana_> so basically what I'm hearing to be a good programmer you probably have to have good english grammar.
[04:35:52] <gehn> meh, no not really?
[04:36:09] <gehn> imperative usually refers more to what might be called a "programming paradigm"
[04:36:10] <wroathe> i r programer the best
[04:36:18] <banana_> isn't the point of grammar to make sense of language in general.
[04:36:27] <gehn> in fact, english grammar rules often don't make good code
[04:36:28] <banana_> that's the whole point of naming conventions
[04:36:51] <wroathe> gehn: I was using it as an adjective
[04:36:56] <banana_> but at least grammar covers aspect, mood, tense etc which is what's considered in naming conventions.
[04:37:01] <gehn> for example userCreate and userSave have the advantage of sorting alphabetically together
[04:37:05] <wroathe> gehn: "giving an authoritative command; peremptory."
[04:37:07] <gehn> wheras createUser and saveUser do not
[04:37:21] <gehn> IMO the former is usually preferable in most code situations
[04:37:51] <banana_> yeah I guess I didn't mean the ordering of the words.
[04:38:05] <gehn> right, but that's exactly the point
[04:38:06] <banana_> I'm just talking about the tense in this case, I think.
[04:38:29] <gehn> there are more (or at least different) considerations when naming stuff in code
[04:38:34] <banana_> so userCreating and userSave for example would be an inconsistent naming standard.
[04:38:50] <gehn> userCreate and userSave is perfectly consistent tho
[04:38:56] <banana_> but if you were a dude that didnt care about grammar as much you'd forget what tenses you used for example.
[04:39:02] <banana_> I get that.
[04:39:45] <gehn> frankly, try to avoid tenses in your code naming conventions
[04:39:54] <banana_> I'm just saying I think the better grammar you have the easier naming conventions will be. because you'd have made sense of the different features of grammar I guess. or whatever term subsumes tense, aspect, mood etc.
[04:40:08] <gehn> I don't think so
[04:40:23] <gehn> precisely because good english grammar does not necessarily make good code naming conventions
[04:40:43] <gehn> for many reasons, of which I gave at least one example, but there are more I'm sure I could come up with
[04:40:53] <banana_> so you'd think "oh shit that's right I'm keeping this stuff in perfect tense for the verb" versus a guy like "ummm whats perfect tense, hmmm what way did the verb look in my other code"
[04:40:58] <banana_> idk
[04:41:31] <gehn> or forget about tenses and english grammar, and write what makes sense in the context of code, because you're writing code, not the next harry potter novel
[04:42:00] <banana_> gehn: I understand your point and im not arguing with chaning the order of the words that's ok with me but you're keeping the verb tense the same which is good also the mood i think
[04:42:09] <banana_> like imperative is a grammatical mood right
[04:42:26] <gehn> I feel you're not understanding the point because you keep talking about stuff like mood
[04:42:30] <gehn> code doesn't have a mood
[04:42:40] <banana_> imperative mood means like ordering somebody so verbs that invoke that kind of meaning.
[04:42:48] <gehn> I think the only safe assertion here is that there *may* be a correlation between intelligence (which is to say IQ specifically) and the likelihood that any given person speaks using proper grammar
[04:43:26] <gehn> which is to say, people who are more intelligent are more likely to have a range of factors which would influence the fact that they have high skill with language in general (english, french, computer or otherwise etc)
[04:43:35] <banana_> well sticking with imperative format would suggest there is grammatical mood involved in naming conventions.

[04:43:59] <banana_> i think that's what I heard before about imperative verbs right.
[04:44:01] <gehn> I don't think grammatical mood is a relevant topic here
[04:44:08] <gehn> nor imperative verbs
[04:44:18] <gehn> i.e. all this discussion is kind of missing the forest for the trees
[04:45:04] <gehn> there's already a (not entirely uncommon) convention for indicating time relation

[04:45:22] <gehn> or preSomeThing() and postSomeThing();

[04:48:33] <banana_> I just feel like there's a better way to understand naming conventions besides just from experience.
[04:48:58] <banana_> I'm a programmer with feelings I guess. just like an instinct maybe.
[04:49:19] <gehn> banana_, plausible, but as noted, I don't think anyone has taken it upon themselves to fill this gap in large consolidated book form
[04:49:25] <gehn> blog posts abound, though, surely
[04:49:37] <gehn> maybe you should write the book
[04:50:11] <banana_> maybe im bananas though. gehn: damn yeah I honestly like reading comprehensive books on stuff like this. especially if I think it would help. it might not be some people's thing.
[04:50:19] <gehn> there are plenty of things in life that could probably be learned in a better way than "from experience" yet "from experience" is the only real way that exists (currently)

[04:52:26] <gehn> it's whatever anyone wants, mostly
[04:53:08] <spynxic> Are there keywords in languages that are unique to particular spoken languages
[04:53:10] <banana_> yeah that's what I kind of think is wrong with today's programming it's too loose idk.

[04:54:10] <spynxic> Right gehn. That's quite a limitation for programming languages

[04:54:55] <spynxic> Sure it is. Suppose there are propositions that are able to be made in other languages with ease that don't translate well to English
[04:55:06] <gehn> it doesn't matter
[04:55:07] <banana_> ah didn't know that. honestly Im not sure how many programmers use non-english characters for naming stuff.
[04:55:09] <carlino3> i'm writting a react app, and i need to show a different menu for different viewports (collapsable on small viewports, and full menu on larger ones)
[04:55:09] <spynxic> Such statements are not present in languages of the day
[04:55:20] <gehn> the only "propositions" that matter if you can make them are code propositions
[04:55:24] <carlino3> should i handle this using pure CSS or handling it via JS is also fine?
[04:55:52] <gehn> banana_, some do, in fact plenty do (from my experience)
[04:55:56] <gehn> especially in China
[04:55:59] <spynxic> Code propositions are themselves English centric, the ifs, elses, whiles, etc
[04:56:09] <gehn> spynxic, no they're not, they're logical
[04:56:17] <spynxic> To us sure
[04:56:18] <gehn> logic is not relegated to english only
[04:56:22] <banana_> @carlino3: hmm can you reuse an existsing component out there.
[04:56:26] <gehn> no, to everyone
[04:56:31] <gehn> logic is a formalized field of maths
[04:56:44] <banana_> or is what you want so custom there's no third-party repo out there on npm?
[04:57:12] <banana_> ok you know what gehn if I find a good book I'll link it on here.
[04:57:19] <spynxic> Idk gehn. If it were that clear cut then I believe it'd be a whole lot easier to learn new languages
[04:57:20] <banana_> gonna have to be kindle version though.
[04:57:28] <gehn> spynxic, that doesn't follow
[04:57:54] <gehn> there's a conflation going on here between natural languages and formal languages
[04:58:00] <carlino3> banana_ currently i have a single menu component. i may use css classes and media queries to change how it looks on small devices, or write another menu component for small devices and display it conditionally based on the client width
[04:58:03] <carlino3> what do you think?
[04:58:17] <gehn> just because programming commonly uses english words like "if" and "then" doesn't make programming languages natural languages
[04:58:20] <gehn> they are still formal languages
[04:58:40] <spynxic> I'd like to see a formal language constructed by a non-english speaker
[04:58:49] <gehn> spynxic, ruby
[04:58:51] <banana_> carlino3: yeah but that just styles it differently. hmmm maybe that's ok though if you're ok using display: none; on certain media queries?
[04:59:03] <gehn> ruby's creator is Japanese (I think)

[04:59:30] <banana_> carlino3: you could do what you last said as well.
[04:59:49] <banana_> idk yeah ask what these other guys think i'd like to hear what they think
[04:59:55] <carlino3> yes, both options will work but i'm confused about which one to choose
[05:00:12] <banana_> I'd try to keep it in one component tbh
[05:00:29] <gehn> yeah my instinct would probably be to keep it one component
[05:00:40] <gehn> either way this is close to a solved problem already, and probably a better question for #css
[05:00:42] <banana_> if possible that's the way I roll  with components.
[05:00:47] <gehn> avoid conditional JS for this kind of thing if you can
[05:00:55] <gehn> also google for "hamburger menu"
[05:01:18] <banana_> so when it works out well eventually, for you, you can look at your markup and the component tag with pride tbh.
[05:01:20] <carlino3> yeah i think CSS is the way to go
[05:01:52] <banana_> but if you had two component versions you'd see two different component tags with a little bit of disgust you know? seriously though talking meta though

[05:03:00] <banana_> and not like "wtf why is there two of the same components again?"
[05:03:05] <gehn> I feel like whether it's two components or one would have little bearing (intrinsically) on my level of self pride in the work
[05:03:22] <gehn> it's more about the use cases and whether one way causes more headaches than another

[05:06:21] <gehn> yep, more or less
[05:06:24] <gehn> start simple
[05:06:42] <gehn> though this starts to get into the "Worse Is Better" debate and MIT vs AT&T
[05:06:43] <carlino3> yeah
[05:06:48] <banana_> I'd shoot for one component though but worse case fall back one two if you have to. no ones perfect you can always refactor.
[05:06:58] <carlino3> i should been started from the mobile layout
[05:07:07] <gehn> carlino3, start from both
[05:07:10] <carlino3> now it is a mess to make all things fit into the screen on all viewports
[05:07:19] <spynxic> From Wikipedia: At a Google Tech Talk in 2008 Matsumoto further stated, "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language." .. heh
[05:07:20] <gehn> i.e. get the designer to make both before you write any code
[05:07:22] <banana_> but if you have time now try to make it one. and you can always ask on here for specific help. people on here are react specialists.
[05:07:41] <gehn> or if you are the designer, make both designs in Photoshop (or GIMP or whatever) first
[05:08:09] <carlino3> gehn unfortunately the designer only gave me a PSD of very large dimensions

[05:08:25] <gehn> carlino3, get them to make the mobile design as well
[05:08:36] <gehn> if you do have designers, that should be part of their job responsibilities
[05:08:38] <carlino3> i can't, so i have to do it myself.
[05:09:10] <gehn> well, that really is not the correct business decision
[05:09:22] <banana_> there's another guy on here a lot that's also his own UX guy.
[05:09:27] <gehn> but your only choice then is probably to try to convince the business (which is to say your managers) of this fact
[05:09:27] <carlino3> yes, i agree that it is they responsability.

[05:10:02] <gehn> get your managers (or their managers) to tell the designer to also make mobile designs
[05:10:22] <gehn> if you're not a designer, and the company has designers, you shouldn't be tasked with this, only the implementation
[05:10:29] <banana_> ideally
[05:10:41] <gehn> I dunno, like unless you want to, like if you enjoy it, I guess go ahead
[05:10:56] <gehn> either way, get a mobile mock/wireframe first, be that created by your or someone else
[05:11:10] <banana_> I'm in a project where it's a bit screwy when being handed requirements from UX, sometimes, they're mostly good to work with.
[05:11:33] <gehn> sure, UX designers often have very bad instincts when it comes to what's reasonable to implement
[05:11:53] <gehn> which is why there *should* be a formalized process of design, mockups, requirements documentation and peer review of all of the above
[05:11:54] <banana_> ljharb crapped on their button designed when I mentioned it. so idk some places are worse than others.
[05:11:59] <gehn> but, you know, not all businesses do this
[05:12:02] <banana_> *button design
[05:12:18] <banana_> I wish mine was like that.
[05:12:21] <gehn> garbage in garbage out
[05:12:35] <banana_> yep like I said earlier, I learned the hard way in this field.
[05:12:50] <carlino3> i agree with all, but this is a very informal project. there is no manager, or organization. that is the big problem
[05:12:52] <gehn> if the business doesn't do this or doesn't have this kind of process formalized, do your best to do it yourself
[05:13:16] <gehn> carlino3, then my recommendation is to take it upon yourself to do this
[05:13:19] <banana_> this field is crazy because literally anybody with 50k can start a software company.
[05:13:48] <gehn> it's really risky to just improvise in this arena, you open yourself to all kinds of client/customer/manager complaints
[05:14:02] <gehn> if you at least create *something* (however limited) and get *someone* to approve it
[05:14:13] <gehn> when they come back and say "I wanted the button to be blue not red!"
[05:14:19] <banana_> ^ yeah or if that doesnt work out get enough experience and move up eventually.
[05:14:33] <gehn> you can point to the document and say "survey says that is a lie because you approved the red button"
[05:14:35] <banana_> haha
[05:14:58] <banana_> yeah but if they're classist then idk they're gonna eff you no matter what.
[05:15:08] <banana_> maybe im pessimistic.
[05:15:15] <gehn> then you're screwed no matter what, but you're still protected as much as is possible
[05:15:21] <banana_> true
[05:15:25] <gehn> and if you're screwed no matter what, find a different job
[05:15:30] <gehn> that's a hostile work environment
[05:15:48] <banana_> yeah it's smart to have bases covered. especially i think in a political landscape if youre able to navigate well enough.
[05:15:55] <gehn> yup
[05:15:57] <spynxic> The most difficult task I find in developing for the public is ensuring that the same code can transition between many flavors of devices consistently
[05:16:46] <banana_> that's why I think comp sci schools should require future programmers/engineers to read "the prince"
[05:16:55] <banana_> if they really cared for their students.
[05:16:58] <gehn> machiavelli?
[05:17:00] <banana_> yep
[05:17:17] <banana_> he gives the strategy and the basis for that strategy
[05:17:18] <gehn> well, school doesn't typically prepare you for the real world in that manner in any field of study
[05:17:21] <edk> i'm not sure anyone impressionable should read that
[05:18:02] <gehn> though to be fair the "selling point" of university is "well rounded education" meaning they force you to take those other kinds of classes outside your field of study to (it is claimed) make you a "better more well rounded person"
[05:18:09] <gehn> so, point being, this is already the case generally
[05:18:36] <gehn> though people are probably still free to choose underwater feminist basket weaving over introduction to political philosophy to satisfy their credit requirements
[05:18:48] <banana_> it's not as evil as it looks. what's evil imo is protectionism. if that makes sense. he actually gives solid reasoning for acting a certain way. based on observation how people feel in certain situations. idk i think he was a good guy.
[05:19:45] <gehn> banana_, but that's a topic that belongs in an Introduction to Political Philosophy course, like this one from Yale https://oyc.yale.edu/political-science/plsc-114
[05:19:47] <gehn> not in here
[05:19:49] <banana_> idk I think if you wanted to help your students survive a political landscape youd educate them on power strategies
[05:20:16] <gehn> banana_, yeah but fundamentally universities don't actually have that interest
[05:20:21] <banana_> just like using a sound strategy helps you succeed at stuff, anything in general.
[05:20:25] <wroathe> gehn: underwater feminist basket weaving will be the way of the future
[05:20:29] <wroathe> gehn: screw STEM
[05:20:36] <gehn> they have an interest in making money, and that interest is mostly fowarded by technical training in topics relevant to industry
[05:20:43] <banana_> gehn: true yeah I think youre right
[05:20:48] <gehn> which is why most universities teach Java and C++
[05:20:55] <gehn> good universities teach scheme/lisp
[05:21:11] <gehn> scheme/lisp is the correct intro to CS 101 course
[05:21:20] <nedbat> gehn: is MIT a good university?
[05:21:21] <gehn> Java and C++ are there because that's what industry wants
[05:21:30] <gehn> nedbat, most people regard it as such
[05:21:34] <spynxic> gehn, I'm not sure where but I recall learning that universities operate under a different goal today than did past institutions. Educating for workforce pursuits rather than helping flourish intellect
[05:21:41] <nedbat> gehn: they switched to Python from scheme
[05:21:50] <gehn> nedbat, yes I'm aware
[05:22:06] <gehn> python's actually not a horrible choice in this regard, but scheme would still be better
[05:22:11] <gehn> and historically MIT did teach scheme
[05:22:29] <gehn> they still do, it's just that most of their courses use python... like intro to algorithms and data structures uses python
[05:22:36] <gehn> but they also have scheme courses
[05:23:26] <gehn> python is at least way better for an intro to programming course than Java or C++
[05:23:33] <nedbat> gehn: i agree with that
[05:23:34] <gehn> but likely also again driven by industry demands
[05:23:52] <nedbat> gehn: they chose it because it was better for integrating with other things than scheme was
[05:24:00] <gehn> not necessarily by the best interests of the students as it relates to giving them a high quality understanding of programming

[05:24:44] <gehn> sure, well, scheme/lisp still remains a niche language and likely doesn't have the kind of tooling or ecosystem found in more popular languages
[05:25:25] <gehn> IMO that shouldn't be particularly relevant for an intro to programming course because such a course should be focused on fundamentals and have little or no need of external integrations other than being able to read and write from the file system
[05:25:55] <Slade> also Lisp:   https://toggl.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/toggl-how-to-save-the-princess-in-8-programming-languages-0c32e93f47f3f6401913846c4c184e3e.jpg
[05:26:04] <gehn> though if the tooling and integration is a concern, could just use Clojure
[05:26:30] <gehn> but then that brings about the inevitable need to understand some actual Java related stuff which is not ideal
[05:27:16] <banana_> yeah I think if a school can teach a programmer how to program well that's ok. but it would be nice if they taught you how to live in the environment your degree aims at.

[05:28:43] <banana_> that thing is, it's just a book, one guy's life experience/analysis. there's more on that topic im sure. other strategies maybe even extensions to his work.
[05:28:58] <gehn> banana_, yes and it's all mostly covered in that Yale course
[05:29:00] <banana_> i dont doubt it haha wow though
[05:29:10] <gehn> also it's free

[05:31:29] <banana_> I'd go to a professor if I was stuck on some critical idea that I couldn't get past.
[05:31:37] <theskillwithin> you can learn a lot online
[05:31:55] <gehn> banana_, you can check the syllabus and buy the books
[05:32:05] <banana_> theskillwithin: yeah wikipedia has taught me more than I ever learned in school.
[05:32:25] <gehn> banana_, in fact that's the course structure already. first you read book A, then watch the lecture(s) on it, then book B, then C etc
[05:32:29] <theskillwithin> i hate when the assigned book is written by the teacher, and it changes every year
[05:32:30] <banana_> so it's a course about his book or the author in general.
[05:32:49] <gehn> banana_, no it's what I just described
[05:32:51] <banana_> because I'm not as interested in his backstory just the merit of his work.
[05:32:58] <gehn> it's not really about his work

[05:36:07] <gehn> I thought it was excellent
[05:36:09] <gehn> ymmv ofc
[05:36:53] <gehn> the lecturer does a really good job of avoiding modern partisan related stuff, and it's pretty hard to tell whether he's left-ish or right-ish on the political spectrum, which is exactly what you want from a course like that

[05:38:13] <banana_> yeah I'm not much of a lecture guy. for some reason. more of a book person.
[05:38:15] <gehn> as noted, the syllabus should have the reading list
[05:38:39] <banana_> yeah ok maybe the lectures will be interesting after reading through first.
[05:38:41] <gehn> I feel that, I'm more of a book person, but I do like good lectures as well

[05:38:58] <gehn> depends a lot on the lecturer's oratory style etc
[05:39:06] <banana_> i hate lectures especially if I haven't done research first.
[05:39:13] <gehn> I can CTRL-f for text in a book, but not in a video
[05:39:43] <gehn> there's somewhat of an ongoing debate in fact, in modern times, as to "Is The Lecture Dead?"
[05:39:54] <gehn> there's a case to be made I think on both sides of that debate
[05:40:09] <banana_> idk about that. Ive noticed some people are good listeners.
[05:40:26] <gehn> but like, is there really a good reason we need to gather 300 people in a room and have them listen to one person for an hour at a time? maybe not so much anymore, esp in the age of online
[05:40:55] <banana_> yeah it's getting archaic but I read somewhere the powers that be love archaic shit.

[05:41:09] <Slade> <banana_> yeah I think if a school can teach a programmer how to program well that's ok. but it would be nice if they taught you how to live in the environment your degree aims at.  <-- 4 year programming degree? what environment hasnt radically changed within 4 years
[05:41:17] <banana_> like the upper classes love british stuff in america because it's archaic.
[05:41:36] <gehn> they do?
[05:41:38] <banana_> but maybe that book i read was outdated. was interesting though.
[05:41:43] <gehn> I thought we spanked the brits hard like 200 years ago
[05:42:04] <banana_> yeah from this book I read. it wasnt a kindle version so I cant give you a nice quote
[05:42:31] <Slade> gehn, but yea. then them and the canadians burned down the whitehouse.. its like school kids, you beat up the bully and now you're best friends
[05:42:51] <banana_> basically paraphrasing he said "the upper classes dont like Britian because she's strong but because she's feeble"
[05:43:10] <banana_> basically a testament to how much they value the "old ways"
[05:43:36] <banana_> that's also why snobs and upper class people like real clothing fibers and no synthetics.

[05:44:05] <gehn> from the amount of rich people who wear track suits, I'm not sure this is the case
[05:44:07] <banana_> american. it was a book about the american class system.
[05:44:18] <banana_> I lived in a snobby area for 5 years and fucked me up.
[05:44:19] <Slade> banana_, how old was this book, was it a book on fiction?
[05:44:28] <gehn> sounds like liberal fan fiction

[05:44:47] <Slade> the liberals are the upper class these days,  unless they're energy tycoons
[05:44:53] <gehn> america doesn't really have a class system
[05:44:57] <banana_> it was actually kind of old but recommended in a clothing book that got into philosophy. I was trying to fit in a snobby area
[05:44:59] <gehn> by contrast, india does
[05:45:13] <Slade> banana_, well that explains a lot!
[05:45:13] <banana_> that's actually what this guy was refuting.
[05:45:42] <Slade> well, most people in the US are 1%ers worldwide
[05:45:43] <banana_> the class system is different yeah. also not true based on my experience. ive seen it but it took me like 4 years to realize it fully on my own.
[05:46:28] <banana_> I moved and lived in a different part of the states for 5 years. I think that helps to realize the difference.
[05:46:36] <gehn> Slade, but those people would then be in the US, and as such not 1%ers within their home region
[05:46:48] <gehn> it's the old "starving children in africa, eat your broccoli" fallacy
[05:47:09] <Slade> gehn, only partially correct in a global economy.
[05:47:17] <gehn> mostly correct
[05:47:18] <banana_> I could link you the book, again it's kinda old but I like his analysis of the different classes.
[05:47:26] <Slade> gehn, even beggars on the street have cellphone newer and better than mine
[05:47:51] <gehn> Slade, beggars on the street are often not even close to destitute, some are but many are not
[05:47:54] <banana_> he also references sociologists how totally support the notions of classes in the US. and from my experience it's absolutely true.
[05:47:56] <Slade> being black in the US correlates more do dying early than being poor
[05:47:59] <gehn> that doesn't change anything about the situation though really
[05:48:29] <gehn> most of your costs living in the US will still be related to US prices, US inflation and the overall US economy
[05:48:45] <wroathe> I get all of my political beliefs from Joe Rogan
[05:48:46] <Slade> my point is, its not hard to be ok in the US. the US doesnt have a real Dharvai equiv
[05:48:52] <wroathe> Really saves on the time and thinking
[05:48:55] <banana_> it's an interesting topic for sure. because it gets complicated I think
[05:48:58] <gehn> Slade, agreed
[05:49:10] <banana_> there's no castes though in that sense youre right. or like royal titles.
[05:49:18] <gehn> wroathe, nothing wrong with that
[05:49:19] <banana_> like the brits have
[05:49:35] <Slade> titles don't reflect being upper class
[05:49:48] <gehn> I don't find a ton of actual ideology originating from rogan himself, more from his guests
[05:50:04] <gehn> he tends to a good job IMO of having a diverse range of guests as well

[05:50:42] <banana_> yeah he's ok but sorta lacks observation on classes or does know about it but doesnt want to talk about it.
[05:50:59] <banana_> he's from the East coast so he might be aware of the east coast establishment.
[05:51:01] <gehn> he does a podcast, it is what it is
[05:51:24] <gehn> he's fundamentally a content creator, and for content creators, generally more content is better for revenue, not necessarily the quality or nature of that content
[05:51:35] <Slade> using traditional class lines is way too blurry for any real context
[05:51:43] <gehn> it used to be "hearts and minds", now it's "clicks and likes"
[05:53:14] <banana_> think about it this way. before and after there was One State where everybody had to swear allegiance to, there were powerful families. if you were part of the most powerful family you'd had power over the surrounding area. in america what happened when the king removed? No families benefited from that change of power?
[05:53:48] <banana_> or we're just a democracy like the lore says? everybody is equal and koombiya
[05:53:55] <gehn> this is treading a bit too much into dangerous territory (for this chan)
[05:54:10] <banana_> was removed*
[05:54:15] <gehn> but secondly, I haven't a clue what you're trying to convey there
[05:54:15] <banana_> ah ok
[05:54:24] <Slade> if you refer to being upper class as having generational wealth and income streams, than the large portion of US upper class is 'newly rich'
[05:54:57] <banana_> at least we have a state that surrounds us all i guess. ok next subject
[05:55:01] <banana_> js stuff i guess
[05:55:20] <gehn> america was precisely a rebellion against the idea that kings and queens are a valid form of governance, and that their right to govern and eat all the best food, have all the money, all the women, all the clothes, execute you because you said something mean, etc, that all this was granted to them by god

[05:55:57] <gehn> so, not sure what you're on about with families and benefitted from change etc
[05:55:59] <Slade> gehn, no, like the civil war, the American rebellion was over money and taxation
[05:56:01] <wroathe> Well, you say that, but we've got one party actively trying to go back to those days.
[05:56:19] <banana_> i dont just mean economic means but I think that's enabler. if that makes sense. i havent completely figured it out and I think the book I read just scratched the actual truth tbh. it's complicated crap.
[05:56:23] <Slade> occams razor those thoughts
[05:56:34] <gehn> Slade, money and taxation wasn't the reason
[05:56:42] <gehn> it may have been an inciting factor
[05:56:57] <Slade> gehn, root cause analysis
[05:56:57] <gehn> but the thing I just noted was a huge core motivation
[05:57:17] <gehn> the pilgrims didn't leave on the mayflower because of money and taxation
[05:57:26] <banana_> wealth afaik creates the classes which includes culture etc.
[05:57:43] <gehn> wroathe, some people in that party, yes
[05:57:47] <banana_> called class stratification but again it's just a train of thought it might not actually be the whole truth.
[05:57:53] <wroathe> gehn: Yes. The ones in charge.
[05:57:57] <banana_> just an analysis for some people that cared.
[05:58:00] <gehn> wroathe, biden?
[05:58:26] <gehn> both parties have their religious line they would like others to toe
[05:58:48] <wroathe> gehn: Graham, McConnell, Rubio, Stefanik, Ron Johnson
[05:58:51] <wroathe> gehn: The list goes on
[05:58:54] <banana_> so wealth is the water but the actual system is the tree that grows. if that analogy makes more sense.
[05:59:04] <gehn> banana_, it's confounded by the fact that poor people can and do suddenly become rich though
[05:59:11] <wroathe> gehn: McCarthy
[05:59:16] <banana_> that doesnt mean they elevate in class.
[05:59:26] <Slade> <banana_> wealth afaik creates the classes which includes culture etc.  <-- kim k didnt create culture with wealth
[05:59:31] <gehn> seems by the earlier axioms it does though ^
[05:59:33] <banana_> i think for that reason actually is why classes exist in the first place.
[06:00:17] <wroathe> gehn: People keep trying to paint it as just a few extremists, but that vote they undertook to oust Liz Cheney from leadership completely shoots that argument in the head.
[06:00:19] <banana_> I can link the book but basically if youre part of a higher class, middle class and up you dont want some random pleb with money to come in and have status over your area.
[06:00:29] <gehn> wroathe, I don't see any of them clamoring for reinstating a royal throne
[06:00:39] <banana_> but it's an over simplification of it but trying to connect the dots for you
[06:00:57] <gehn> imposing their religious ideologies yes, reinstating a royalty based form of governance, no
[06:01:27] <wroathe> gehn: Is there really that much of a difference between a dictator for life and a king, in practice?
[06:01:31] <banana_> because that pleb doesnt know manners, farts too much or says eccentric stuff that you were told is bad to say. so why should the pleb thrive in your area just because he has money.
[06:01:43] <wroathe> I don't see it, besides maybe religious justification for the position.
[06:01:47] <gehn> wroathe, which dictator for life have these people said they want? and show me the citation.
[06:01:56] <banana_> so you shit on that guy until he leaves. and I just basically described the middle class for you.
[06:02:01] <wroathe> gehn: Now you're just playing dumb :P
[06:02:13] <wroathe> gehn: And this conversation won't be going anywhere, so I'm going to move on :P
[06:02:23] <gehn> I'm not talking about the dumb quip used by hicks about "god emperor <REDACTED>"

[06:02:37] <gehn> saying it in actual seriousness
[06:02:41] <gehn> none of them have
[06:03:07] <banana_> that's literally also what snobs are. from what i read middle class and snobs are the same thing. upper classes dont need to be snobs basically. they dont need to prove anything.

[06:06:13] <banana_> at least they havent put "no politics" yet haha
[06:06:14] <gehn> which is one of the points the Yale guy makes in his opening lecture
[06:06:50] <gehn> also that the questions being discussed today on this topic, haven't fundamentally changed in probably thousands of years
[06:06:54] <banana_> yeah I think it's good to question literally everything. obviously as long as you dont crazy over it.
[06:08:02] <banana_> for me it was partly related to a life experience so tie it back to your advice about programming naming convention you made a good point.
[06:08:12] <banana_> experience is valuable for sure.
[06:11:21] <wroathe> gehn: All I'm saying is that if you don't actively work to nurture a democracy, that's the same thing as endorsing an autocracy in my book. Trump tried to abuse his powers TWICE, that we know of, by pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation against his domestic political rivals, and by waiting to see how the capitol riots panned out before making any sort of statement, and his entire party was
[06:11:27] <wroathe> just fine with that, save a few key members that are being demonized. They lost 60 something challenges in court that the election was rigged, and they're still going along with that. Actions speak louder than words.

[06:13:05] <gehn> so bitching = desire for dictatorship?
[06:13:16] <banana_> imo all he did was exploit the innnate tension going on.
[06:13:34] <banana_> wait he said trump awhile ago
[06:13:38] <banana_> sry
[06:13:41] <wroathe> gehn: I was fine with them taking it to court. That's a well functioning democracy. But losing every challenge and then continuing to float the idea that there's somethign wrong with our system is undemocratic.

[08:19:19] <matsaman> I know how Englishers and Romancers would pronounced it
[08:19:20] <Maxdamantus> (basically "Liberia" but missing a /i/)
[08:19:22] <banana_> I mostly use american webster symbols
[08:19:23] <matsaman> dunno about other language families
[08:19:32] <matsaman> probably hell for japanese
[08:19:34] <banana_> e.g. ˈlī-b(ə-)rə
[08:19:46] <theskillwithin> Maxdamantus oh i thought u meant something else
[08:20:01] <matsaman> no doubt still better than 'euro' and 'LaTeX'
[08:20:02] <theskillwithin> i thought you mean't without the r
[08:20:27] <banana_> merriam-webster uses the slashes for syllable clarity but it doesnt change the sound
[08:20:35] <banana_> I mean uses hyphens -
[08:21:06] <Maxdamantus> I'm not sure what that notation is meant to be, but I'm guessing the `(ə-)` bit denotes an omissable scwha, but for me that syllable is the one with primary stress, so not omitted.
[08:21:14] <banana_> they have a guide if you're interested in understanding their phonetics. idk about IPA that shit looks complicated
[08:21:35] <matsaman> it looks complicated to type/write

[08:21:43] <banana_> @Maxdamantus thank God for you
[08:21:44] <matsaman> I have that handbook from Oxford press somewhere
[08:21:47] <Maxdamantus> (yes, my notation is more-or-less IPA, just used "3" instead of the backwards epsilon symbol, since I'm on my phone)
[08:21:48] <banana_> one sec let me process that
[08:21:51] <matsaman> gehn: heh
[08:23:26] <banana_> "I'm guessing the `(ə-)` bit denotes an omissable scwha" yep that's what the parens means in most the phonetic system I've seen. "but for me that syllable is the one with primary stress, so not omitted." I disagree with this but I have also thought about it.
[08:23:48] <banana_> Maxdamantus: case and point the phonetics of "library"
[08:24:41] <banana_> one phonetic version on AWD is /'lī-ˌbrer-ē/
[08:25:04] <banana_> the first syllable actually has the primary stress. and it's very similar and also a noun like libera

[08:26:14] <Maxdamantus> /,lai'b3:rə/

[08:26:35] <matsaman> secondary stress? =)
[08:26:43] <banana_> are there nouns that have secondary stress first?
[08:27:05] <banana_> talking english sorry haha. just wondering what the correct english way might be to pronounce the server name
[08:27:35] <Maxdamantus> banana_: sure. "recording"
[08:27:48] <banana_> i think that's what the guy said about not promoting a certain way to say it. because it's a multi-lingual server
[08:28:04] <banana_> hmm
[08:28:04] <Maxdamantus> "potato"
[08:28:12] <matsaman> it's also a purely text medium
[08:28:15] <banana_> is that a noun or a gerund or both?
[08:28:16] <matsaman> couldn't really matter less
[08:28:30] <banana_> yeah it's a noun huh not just a gerund
[08:28:37] <Maxdamantus> banana_: "banana"
[08:28:46] <banana_> wow lol
[08:28:47] <banana_> wait
[08:28:57] <rannnn8888> Hey have way get the ajax bihind a proxy ?  https://dpaste.org/72qh
[08:29:10] <banana_> bə-ˈna-nə is how AWD has it
[08:29:20] <banana_> they dont place a secondary stress first.
[08:29:49] <banana_> neither does the google dictionary if you search "banana define"
[08:29:49] <Maxdamantus> banana_: right, primary stress is on the second syllable, secondary stress is on the first syllable.
[08:30:04] <banana_> no it's not for banana like I said.
[08:30:16] <banana_> the first syllable is unstressed in this case.
[08:31:05] <banana_> same thing for "recording" actually there's no secondary stress denoted in the phonetics that I see
[08:32:23] <Maxdamantus> banana_: depending on how you look at it, I think you might just consider both non-primary syllables to be "unstressed" because there isn't a second syllable pair to take the secondary stress.
[08:32:28] <banana_> I'm not a super expert at phonetics but I know some. AWD has /ri-ˈkôr-diŋ/ hexchat doesnt like their equivalent symbol for ô so I subbed it in
[08:32:55] <matsaman> you might need some more fonts
[08:33:36] <banana_> huh this is interesting but damn let me re-read what you said.
[08:33:49] <banana_> spent almost gonna hit the hay though
[08:34:23] <banana_> ok I read
[08:34:44] <banana_> Maxdamantus: I think there's specific situations where secondary stress is used.
[08:35:24] <Maxdamantus> Maybe "prerequisite"?
[08:35:29] <banana_> and from what I noticed it often is in situation where you want the other syllable to have a non-schwa vowel (But again this isn't the rule or if it is it's beyond my knowledge)
[08:35:39] <banana_> in a situation*
[08:36:15] <banana_> i've actually have wondered about secondary stress and the real difference between them and non-stress syllables
[08:36:26] <banana_> but there is officially a difference apparently.
[08:37:05] <ljharb> i've never gotten the hand of those phonetics letters
[08:37:19] <ljharb> like i can't tell you what a short vs long sound is or how to pronounce a schwa
[08:37:56] <Maxdamantus> secondary stress is definitely significant in some English words. I don't remember the particular rules around them, but if you think of a word like "procrastination", the second syllable there definitely has more stress than the first and fourth syllables.
[08:37:59] <ljharb> but i can definitely transliterate things so you know how i pronounce them, just not with IPA or whatever it is
[08:38:05] <banana_> Maxdamantus: you're right that google's dictionary doesnt have a secondary stress on the prē  syllable but AWD shows this /(ˌ)prē-ˈre-kwə-zət/
[08:38:13] <matsaman> someone should probably replace it with something post-computers
[08:38:16] <Maxdamantus> er, less than first and fifth*
[08:38:24] <banana_> AWD does include the optional utterance parens on a possible secondary stress
[08:38:29] <Maxdamantus> eh, I've miscounted.
[08:38:41] <banana_> but tbh i couldnt tell you what difference that would sound like
[08:39:38] <Maxdamantus> the stress of "procrastination" should be "pro,cra.stin'a.tion"
[08:40:04] <Maxdamantus> ("." used to separate syllables without a stress marker)
[08:40:17] <banana_> that's an interesting example though because it breaks up the r sound to the next vowel. which i think is less common usually the r is part of the previous vowel called a "rhotic vowel"
[08:40:32] <gehn> you say tomato, I say tomato, we all scream for tomato
[08:40:52] <matsaman> which syllable is stressed isn't quite as important in English as some other languages, no?
[08:40:53] <banana_> like ˈlī-ˌbrer-ē library for example
[08:41:13] <matsaman> gehn: reads like we're all on the same page =P
[08:42:07] <gehn> you scream, I scream, WHY ARE WE ALL SCREAMING AHHHHHHH!
[08:42:32] <banana_> from what I could barely manage reading some on a wikipedia page I think I read that the difference between secondary stress and unstressed is the position your mouth when your pronounce the syllable haha sounds weird sorry.
[08:42:54] <banana_> like your pronounce it higher up than in a unstressed syllable
[08:43:13] <Maxdamantus> PRICE NEAR FLEECE
[08:43:15] <banana_> but it's not as drastic and obvious as a primary stress
[08:43:31] <Maxdamantus> PRICE NEAR FLEECE COMMA
[08:43:46] <banana_> *like you pronounce
[08:44:06] <Maxdamantus> (those are the lexical sets corresponding to "library" and "liberia" for me)
[08:45:02] <Maxdamantus> but they seem like they should be stressed differently, because of the extra syllable.
[08:45:12] <Maxdamantus> it's like "librarian".
[08:45:24] <Maxdamantus> or "Liberian"
[08:45:33] <Maxdamantus> just without the /n/ on the end.
[08:46:34] <banana_> "In some analyses, for example the one found in Chomsky and Halle's The Sound Pattern of English, English has been described as having four levels of stress: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary, but the treatments often disagree with one another."
[08:46:40] <Maxdamantus> oh, and without the /i/
[08:46:41] <banana_> wtf those bastards never told us.
[08:46:45] <banana_> I hope that's not true
[08:48:02] <banana_> Maxdamantus: yeah that's a good example /ˌlīˈbrerēən/ is what google shows.
[08:48:40] <banana_> brer has the er rhotic vowel though instead of the schwa with the r at the end.
[08:48:55] <banana_> so it makes sense imo to have the primary stress there.
[08:49:21] <banana_> idk phonetic standards are finnicky for sure. but it sorta makes sense most of the time I think.
[08:50:39] <matsaman> brer rabbit
[08:50:56] <banana_> a lot of multiple syllable words often dont put primary stress on syllables with schwa components i.e. the ər rhotic vowel unless it's a one syllable word like /bərd/ bird
[08:51:26] <banana_> and technically that's a stressed schwa. but thats all I know. IPA shows that schwa difference.
[08:53:03] <banana_> Maxdamantus: so like the 'brer syllable in librarian rhymes with bear because it uses the same r-colored vowel /er/
[08:53:22] <banana_> just to discuss your example further idk
[08:54:42] <banana_> Maxdamantus: here's AWD explanations they get pretty detailed in their reasonings idk if youre interested it taught me a lot https://www.merriam-webster.com/assets/mw/static/pdf/help/guide-to-pronunciation.pdf
[08:55:59] <quesker> I made the fiddle but that works on my phone so not sure it will demo the issue

I'd like modules not chosen during config to exclude that code during the production build. I'm not sure how this would be possible, but I'm guessing I'll need webpack to do it.
[13:51:39] <hacks> so someone would get full source, run the config which sets up then runs the build which can then be deployed

[16:53:19] <johtso> something that I'm struggling with at the moment is the fact that "map" is a method of Array. This means you code needs to constantly be worrying about whether it's dealing with an Array or an Iterable/Generator. Using something like _.map fixes that right?
[16:53:35] <johtso> I could imagine there are quite a few similar situations

[17:04:24] <entuland> can't tell, for the kind of JS I'm used to, I almost never have to worry about getting the wrong types in my function - and when it's important to fail gracefully I add such checks where it matters

[17:50:13] <johtso> using a 3rd party library with tree shaking seems like a pretty sensible approach though..
[17:50:48] <johtso> although I'm still not sure what library to use..
[17:51:24] <johtso> I want to be able to do standard operations on sequences without worrying what exact type of sequence they are
[17:52:02] <johtso> In a language like Python that's easy.. something like map is a global function rather than a property of a list for example, and it doesn't care what kind of iterable you give it
[17:53:04] <johtso> with javascript.. you want to sum the values in a Map object for example.. and then you find you have an Iterator rather than an array so you can't reduce
[17:53:58] <johtso> any pointers on whether there's a "best" typescript friendly library for this?

[20:05:30] <johtso> ljharb: I think my biggest gripe with "just normalize things to Arrays" is how much extra clutter you end up with in your code, especially when you're making heavy use of Maps and Sets
[20:05:42] *** Quits: Lope (~lope@user/lope) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[20:07:13] <johtso> Array.from(myMap.values()).reduce(... is just making it harder to see what's going on
[20:08:40] <onosendi> johtso: I too came from Python. You'll get used to it.
[20:09:15] <wroathe> johtso: Fortunately Javascript features higher-order functions, and so you can define a helper that makes that conversion for you and applies a function you supply
[20:09:53] <wroathe> johtso: const reduceMap = (...args) => Array.from(m.values()).reduce(...args);
[20:10:35] <wroathe> Ooops
[20:10:43] <wroathe> johtso: const reduceMap = (m, ...args) => Array.from(m.values()).reduce(...args);
[20:11:35] <johtso> wroathe: or I guess the other alternative is to use a function that takes and Iterable and returns and Iterable.. https://www.npmjs.com/package/iter-tools/v/6.1.1#reduce
[20:11:37] <wroathe> And then reduceMap(myMap, (total, num) => total + num, 0); // for example
[20:12:08] <johtso> and only normalise to Array if you have some reason to

[20:17:53] <ljharb> johtso: sure but how many reduces are you really doing
[20:18:14] <ljharb> with Object.fromEntries (and new Map/new Set) and flat/flatMap i rarely find myself needing it
[20:20:52] *** Joins: Northwoods (~Northwood@223.130.30.189)
[20:21:16] <johtso> I mean, so far I'm doing quite a bit of mapping and reducing etc. Using Set and Map for state in my react app and then mapping over it to generate JSX
[20:21:39] <wroathe> johtso: Well, higher order functions are the "final form" of all of this. If you're objecting to the intermediate array, you could certainly build the above function in terms of a for/of loop on an iterator, but trying to use iterators all over the place in the code that actually needs this is just going to be a pain in the ass.
[20:21:40] <johtso> and having less javascript boilerplate in your markup is always nice
[20:22:01] <wroathe> iterators are a low-level means-to-an-end
[20:25:02] *** Joins: nomic (~nomic@2a00:23c6:9910:1201:cdae:ea4b:93a4:1c59)
[20:26:41] <wroathe> Actually, it would be better to lift the core higher order functions up to work on iterators. reduce(map.values(), ...); would be the way to go.
[20:27:19] <wroathe> iterators/Iterables
[20:28:16] <johtso> wroathe: that's the perspective I was coming from and had me reaching for something like iter-tools
[20:31:54] <wroathe> I don't recall what order the higher order functions for array and iterators were added to the language in, but now it makes sense to add versions of the higher-order functions for iterators to the standard library.

[20:33:06] <wroathe> Granted, we probably wouldn't want to pollute Window with names like "reduce", "every", and "some". It'd be cool if JS started shipping modules available for import as part of the standard library.
[20:33:24] <wroathe> import { reduce, fill, some } from 'std';
[20:37:14] *** Quits: zacts (~zak@user/zacts) (Client Quit)
[20:37:41] <Donitz> add it to array
[20:37:49] <Donitz> in this case it's fine imo
[20:38:14] <wroathe> It's already part of array, and only works for array. I'm suggesting generalizing it to all Iterables
[20:38:20] <wroathe> (which includes array)
[20:38:58] <johtso> the current plan seems to be to "add it to Iterable".. which again seems like the wrong approach to me
[20:38:59] <Donitz> eh, Array.from(blah) is fine as long as you don't care too much about performance
[20:39:36] <Donitz> I don't know, that's one of the things I'm not a huge fan of in python
[20:39:42] <Donitz> the iterator system is a bit confusing
[20:39:53] <Donitz> map object, filter object etc.
[20:40:31] <johtso> Donitz: but javascript has Iterators, and returns Iterators in places, but basically expects you to be using Arrays
[20:40:44] <wroathe> johtso: Yeah, the JS standard library has an OOP interface, after all. Shipping those as freestanding functions in a module is wishful thinking.
[20:41:25] *** Joins: fef (~thedawn@user/thedawn)
[20:41:25] <Donitz> indeed
[20:41:40] <Donitz> actually, I would really like it if Set supported many of the array functions
[20:41:43] <Donitz> such as filter
[20:42:43] <Donitz> and sort :P
[20:43:13] <Donitz> though I undertand that sorting a set is probably also an inefficient operation forcing a rebuild of some kind of hash tree
