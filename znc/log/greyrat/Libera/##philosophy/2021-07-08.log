[00:48:55] <arryana> aw
[00:49:09] <arryana> sorry to miss you, was having an inert moment after mowing.
[00:50:21] <Inline> what is energy ?
[00:52:16] <bougyman> Energy is potential work.
[00:52:46] <bougyman> In physics, it's basically the unit we measure work in.
[00:53:59] <Inline> well well well, with potentiality there's a problem of which reference frames you count in not ?
[00:54:30] <Inline> so i'm at rest at earths frame, but earth is itself moving so has energy etc etc.
[00:55:01] <bougyman> When work is transferred from one conitinuum (body/force) to another, it's measured in "energy units" appropriate to the transfer.
[00:55:13] <Inline> so when we refer to energy i suppose we already have a dedicated frame of reference
[00:55:42] <bougyman> the energy units we use to describe a particular transfer _is_ that "frame of reference"
[00:55:44] <Inline> and that also holds into the lower levels as well
[00:57:15] <Inline> when something decomposes we i suppose only refer to the first level of decomposition as energy, not the whole down to the level of electrons/atoms as in strong-force weak-force etc.
[00:58:15] <Inline> so there's the frame aspect as well as the process aspect to it
[00:58:56] <Inline> which things do you count in as in which frames and which processes

[03:57:23] <lalia> I don't have an all-time favorite. My current favorite is Katja Vogt, Samian. My favorite general subject is philosophy of language.
[03:58:20] <lalia> Especially having to do with the application and development of formal language.
[03:58:46] <Samian> I like Wittgenstein and John Locke
[03:59:35] <lalia> Wittgenstein is a solid pick. Locke is too, I'm just a lot less fond of his contributions.
[04:00:17] <Samian> Wittgenstein's contribution to theory of language was that language is more like a game than a picture
[04:00:46] <Samian> before Wittgenstein, the idea in fashion was that language was akin to painting a picture
[04:01:36] <Samian> eh or maybe memory is wrong
[04:01:39] <Samian> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_theory_of_language#:~:text=The%20picture%20theory%20of%20language,of%20affairs%20or%20atomic%20fact.

[04:02:16] <ro-bot-o> [url] Language game (philosophy) - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[04:02:42] <Samian> I guess Wittgenstein invented both analogies?
[04:03:23] <biys> i use the painting a picture analogy all the time when i talk to people
[04:03:33] <biys> my wife is a lazy communicator
[04:03:51] <biys> i really have to try with her to figure out if we're on the same page much less in the same book
[04:04:59] <biys> here's how i describe it as best i can.  when i use the word hell i think of maybe a half day without the internet or something.  ask my dad what hell is and he'd likely say abject poverty.  so when we're ``talking'' and we're using the terms and the words we do in the sequences we do we're creating images in peoples minds of scenarios and circumstance
[04:05:14] <biys> i often wonder how often i'm effectively communicating with people
[04:05:25] <biys> i'll play back the whole conversation in my mind and how it could have been interpreted

[18:10:47] <xerxes> it seems claiming that there is no morality is almost fashionable nowadays. it was fashionable in 1800 too.
[18:11:50] <lalia> Thi takes a fairly balanced but cautious approach to trust in the context of technological advances. My intuitions are probably more critical than what he conveys in that piece, but it's great writing and he makes several thoughtful points.
[18:13:39] <lalia> xerxes: I'm a skeptic, so I don't/haven't claim there are no morals: instead I have a lack of points to offer and am still inquiring into the matter. I also don't have a lot of time to figure it out ATM, I'm invested in other things now.
[18:13:47] <xerxes> but i will admit, Marquis de Sade was actually a little more true to his word. i mean he did rape and torture young girls, even though it did not reach anywhere near his books. moral nihilists today just seem like lazy humanities graduates.

[18:53:48] <luminousnine> Not much else
[18:54:43] <pussipupu> I tried to get into Mastodon but kinda need all the interesting people to already be there
[18:55:25] <pussipupu> That said, there's an EU proposal that might break open the walled gardens, mandatory interop
[19:12:08] <luminousnine> One thing to another. There was a law passed in Germany last month which gave their intelligence agencies the green light to install trojans into their citizens' devices without any reason or suspicion. Basically backdoors for every telecommunication service. I'm just waiting for it to spread. I'm eagerly waiting to see when it becomes relevant here and what the backlash is going to be like, if any. A lot of things can slip through
[19:12:08] <luminousnine> when the nation is focusing on something else.

[19:20:14] <DPA> Mandatory interop is good in theory, but it will probably end up very badly, for 2 reasons:
[19:20:14] <DPA>  1) Who defines which data gets shared, how authentication is done, and so on? For example, I use different accounts for every service, and for things like E-Mail, I host it myself, at least the identifying bit (for E-Mail, the E-Mail address).
[19:20:14] <DPA>     This way, I decide who can link which data to me. But what if they require google or FB single sign on or something like that?
[19:20:14] <DPA>  2) Communities. Imagine all the specialized communities in forums, for example, must interoperate. In essence, that would destroy the communities / forums. They would suddenly be a very different kind of media, and loose what makes them a forum.
[19:20:14] <DPA> Also, what would that mean for websites & blogs?

[20:04:55] <spruit11> anyway,  not sure any of my rambling came trough but the gist was: the legalese normally doesn't mean much
[20:05:50] <pussipupu> this is the first I've seen from you for a while

[20:06:27] <kmh> spruit11,  you're a rambling man rather than a gambling man?
[20:07:26] <luminousnine> I like rambling
[20:07:37] <spruit11> right,  so my arguments were that most agencies already can spy on anyone,  that the 'five eyes' surely can spy on anyone,  that most foreign nations just want in on the action,  and that judges usually only mean rubber stamping
[20:08:14] <spruit11> and that my MacOs and the game I play are likely some form of spyware.  Linux likely too.
[20:08:47] <spruit11> so it's just too late to really expect any form of privacy on your computer
[20:09:55] <luminousnine> Likely is not a strong form of an argument. Show me how Linux is a form of spyware.
[20:11:41] <kmh> well you could have undercover open asource developers smuggling in stuff
[20:11:58] <kmh> and there are government nstitution provided code to linux
[20:12:04] <spruit11> yah,  I wouldn't have said 'likely' if I could because then that would be known,  now wouldn't it?
[20:12:13] <kmh> but i guess that would be detected at some point
[20:12:45] <kmh> spruit11,  known unknowns?
[20:13:03] <spruit11> yah,  it's just likely.

[20:14:25] <arryana> that's just rank paranoia
[20:14:43] <arryana> the world doesn't need more baseless conspiracy theories
[20:14:44] <kmh> with linux it also depends on the distro if we're talking about any distro, then yes i suspect some of them might be likely to come with government spy software at some point
[20:15:02] <kmh> but i doubt this will be true for all distros
[20:15:29] <kmh> the world already has baseless mass surveillance
[20:15:29] <DivFlux> They would be, in theory, capable of being audited for that.
[20:15:48] <kmh> the biger point doesn't require any conspiracy but is a known known
[20:15:53] <spruit11> how do you mean,  audited?
[20:16:20] <kmh> but specifically to linux distors it might sound a bit conspiratory
[20:16:43] <DivFlux> The code is open and you could compare built applications against known safe code.
[20:17:02] <biys> brigand: sorry, abject poverty would be hell for my father
[20:17:15] <biys> where as my usage of the word hell might simply be used to describe a couple hours without the internet
[20:17:17] <spruit11> I am sorry,  but when the CIA orders Fedora to install a patch in the binaries they have to comply according to legislation brought forward after 9/11
[20:17:30] <spruit11> and they're not allowed to talk about that
[20:17:34] <spruit11> same for MacOS
[20:17:52] <spruit11> the US can when they want.
[20:17:54] <DivFlux> So that patch is detectable though. It would be something seen in upstream development
[20:18:02] <arryana> and flat earthers insist satellites are fake
[20:18:03] <spruit11> that I don't know

[20:19:20] <kmh> spruit11,  yes ubuntu doesn't have
[20:19:36] <kmh> nor many of the other distros out there
[20:20:31] <DivFlux> This is really why free software is crucial to freedom. It doesn't stop potential spying necessarily but it definitely is a better starting point to detect it and to avoid it
[20:21:17] <spruit11> yah,  I agree in general but then you run into the 'anyone can patch' problem
[20:21:22] <biys> well... you also need to make sure there's no exploits at all possible levelsl though
[20:21:32] <biys> for example the intel random number generation of the years past
[20:21:44] <DivFlux> Not anyone can patch necessarily, it's not usually a free for all
[20:21:57] <DivFlux> Anyone might be able to fork
[20:22:24] <kmh> DivFlux, indeed
[20:22:26] <spruit11> like,  buffer overruns are still common.  and you're never sure it's a mistake or a plant.  unlikely in most cases but you just don't knw
[20:22:46] <kmh> it's also why i like wikileaks (the concept at least)
[20:23:27] <DivFlux> Yeah, but that's all software. But I think proprietary software is much more inscrutable, and you've know way to even know if it's been patched secretly
[20:23:37] <kmh> they are an (independent) intel agency for the global public of sorts
[20:23:55] <DivFlux> No way to know*
[20:24:06] <kmh> in particularly in areas where the press is increasingly falling
[20:24:19] <spruit11> whose proprietary software? like I said,  US companies have to comply to US terrorist laws
[20:24:46] <kmh> DivFlux,  yes open software is no guarantee but an additional filter/layer of protection
[20:25:11] <kmh> spruit11,  he is agreeing with you
[20:25:29] <spruit11> oh right.  sorry.  non-native.
[20:25:39] <spruit11> didn't get the 'inscrutable' part
[20:25:42] <kmh> spruit11,  as in proprietary software being more suspicious (or prone) to spying than open software

[21:44:19] <bougyman> Sure, percentage wise from the low of 500, that's a big percentage.

[21:46:59] <kmh> that's like 100,000 cases in the US
[21:49:44] <bougyman> huh, worlddata shows it to be at 3700, with a 1560 rolling 7 day average.
[21:50:13] <bougyman> a single day's numbers can be skewed with bulk late reporting and adjustments. the 7 day rolling average is a better measure of what the reality is.
[21:50:25] <kmh> well worlddata lacks the latest update apparently
[21:50:38] <bougyman> or is using a different reporting source.
[21:50:44] <bougyman> Most are using the John's Hopkins data.
[21:51:12] <bougyman> and that's saying 3652
[21:51:18] <bougyman> so yeah, they're using the John's Hopkins data
[21:51:19] <kmh> and the 7 days aberage will catch the increase a few days down the road
[21:51:54] <bougyman> 11,500 cases this week, 16 deaths.
[21:52:07] <bougyman> the deaths would have been cases from a month ago or so.
[21:52:33] <bougyman> compare that to the nl record week of 78,000 cases and 999 deaths.
[21:52:40] <bougyman> The story here is: Cases are well down off the peak.

[23:18:59] <arryana> aw
[23:19:02] <arryana> you can borrow mine
[23:19:06] <lalia> :D
[23:19:11] <arryana> it's going to take me years to sort it
[23:19:23] <lalia> Sounds right. I might not miss it once I've got one again. :P
[23:19:23] <spruit11> I like my garden,  it's very wild now
[23:19:24] <pussipupu> you can wrestle mine
[23:19:33] <arryana> i might take you up on that
[23:19:37] <spruit11> sometimes a hedgehog comes nosing around
[23:19:43] <spruit11> it's neat
[23:19:46] <pussipupu> wild is good but we're trying to get a balance
[23:19:52] <spruit11> nah
[23:20:00] <pussipupu> we get deer sometimes, I've not seen a hedgehog yet
[23:20:01] <arryana> i need to strip this back for three reasons
[23:20:03] <lalia> Fun! I love yard animals, NGL.
[23:20:12] <arryana> we have a hedgehog, as of a few days ago
[23:20:17] <lalia> :3
[23:20:19] <arryana> we've seen him twice
[23:20:32] <arryana> the girls surprised him around 11 pm, and he rolled up
[23:20:43] <arryana> but they didn't hurt him, so he clearly decided they were safe
[23:21:01] <arryana> the biggest reason i need to clear this yard is that the fences are shot.
[23:21:16] <pussipupu> slight tangent but pangolins can survive the bite strength of a lion
[23:21:23] <arryana> i'd like to replace them all, and that'll be a -lot- easier if they aren't covered in undergrowth
[23:21:28] <arryana> really?
[23:21:36] * arryana wonders if they'd survive a shark
[23:21:37] <pussipupu> though I think maybe a hyena can fuck them up
[23:21:40] <arryana> not that it would come up often
[23:21:43] <pussipupu> apparently!
[23:21:46] <arryana> omg
[23:21:48] <arryana> omg
[23:21:50] <arryana> so.
[23:21:56] <pussipupu> most sharks don't do that much pressure
[23:22:09] <arryana> we just need suits made of live pangolins to survive an ocean survival situation
[23:22:10] <pussipupu> hyenas are amazing
[23:22:35] <pussipupu> people used to wear pangolin skin armour
[23:23:01] <arryana> i can see why
[23:23:53] <arryana> the second reason i need to clear the undergrowth is that i need to take down the existing 8x8 shed, which is mostly maintained by structural ivy, and i want to put up a significantly larger glass fronted garden workshop
[23:24:18] <arryana> the third reason is that picking up landmines from the dogs is -way- easier on mulch than it is out of ivy and brush
[23:24:19] <pussipupu> hyenas have an unusual eating order, it's adult females, youngsters, adult males
[23:24:28] <arryana> quite right
[23:24:30] * arryana giggles

[23:24:55] <arryana> we've got a gazebo for the hot tub, but haven't installed either yet

[23:26:07] <pussipupu> our sauna isn't made of asbestos after all
[23:26:14] <pussipupu> and it rained this morning
[23:26:19] <pussipupu> so many good news
[23:29:40] <spruit11> yah,  rain is the best
[23:30:24] <pussipupu> the bird friends have been so happy today, and also me
[23:31:02] <spruit11> I seem to be weird that I prefer rain over most of the rest
[23:31:24] <spruit11> maybe a nice snowy day sometimes,  that I like too
[23:31:32] <arryana> that's excellent
[23:32:05] <arryana> we have blackbirds and wagtails in one hedge, and wood pigeons in another
[23:32:42] <arryana> there's a magpie who comes to sit in a tree at the end of the garden every morning, but i don't think he's nested here
[23:33:10] <pussipupu> do you ever stand in proper downpours, spruit11?
[23:33:23] <pussipupu> Just being part of the rain
[23:33:43] <spruit11> uh,  when I have a good coat I don't mind heavy rain too much
[23:34:04] <pussipupu> oh no don't wear a cost
[23:34:10] <pussipupu> coat*
[23:34:29] <spruit11> right,  naked.  good idea
[23:34:29] <pussipupu> the rain can't hug you in a coat :p
[23:35:04] <spruit11> regrettably I need to inform that I have the physique which makes to neighbours put up curtains
[23:35:11] <spruit11> *inform you
[23:35:15] <spruit11> which is handy
[23:35:37] <pussipupu> we have blackbirds, another thrush, wagtails jackdaws, occasionally hooded crows and magpies, swifts and pheasants mostly in the garden

[23:36:17] <spruit11> hmm.  +1 for the jest,  -1 for delivery.  0 again
[23:38:45] <pussipupu> I try to work on the principle that people looking into my garden can not look if they don't like it
[23:39:03] <spruit11> yah,  that might work too

[23:50:16] <arryana> haha
[23:50:26] <arryana> fortunately, this garden is almost completely private
[23:50:48] <arryana> there's one small corner with a couple of windows that overlook it, but that won't be true once the fences are changed anyway
[23:54:46] <pussipupu> the dream is a house in a few hectares of forest
