[04:42:57] <mrus> what's the correct way to pass a struct pointer to a function that accepts an interface, in order to be able to get it back through a different function which returns the previously passed interface? I'm stuck with invalid memory/nil pointer exceptions.
[04:45:51] <CommunistWolf> "to get it back" ?
[04:45:55] <CommunistWolf> perhaps some example code would be helpful

[04:47:14] <CommunistWolf> if you've got an interface, you can use a type assertion to get the underlying concrete type back, if that's what you're after
[04:47:35] *** Joins: predmijat (~predmijat@mail.strogopro.com)

[04:48:43] <mrus> CommunistWolf: and using get to retrieve it: https://github.com/kataras/iris/blob/48c00f7cc22fa9620f30810b4b63b79dc4ae6d32/core/memstore/memstore.go#L814
[04:49:49] <mrus> doing a `.set("key", bla)` and a `.get("key").(*myBlaStruct)`
[04:49:54] <CommunistWolf> ok, so Get returns a value of type interface{}. If you want the underlying concrete type, and you know what it must be, you can use a type assertion - type := myVal.(*myStruct)
[04:49:59] <CommunistWolf> ^
[04:50:10] <CommunistWolf> it'll panic if you get it wrong
[04:50:16] <mrus> yes
[04:51:19] <mrus> now, I'm doing this within a function, that `get`s the myStruct pointer and assigns it to a new struct like so: newStruct.bla = myVal.(*myStruct)
[04:51:31] <mrus> at the end of the function I'm returning that newStruct
[04:52:03] <mrus> it seems like when I'm trying to access newStruct.bla afterwards I get a pointer exception

[09:59:58] <opcode> need some help deciphering all the conflicting tutorials online for go modules.  Every example seems to import "example.com/hello"... why the fsck would I ever want to prefix my imports with example.com?  Is that a placeholder for e.g. github? what's the actual syntax for importing local modules that I've got in some arbitrary place under /home/opcode/?
[10:01:20] <FenderQ> that really confused me prior to the original GOPATH rules

[10:03:05] <FenderQ> my go/src/foobar now includes package foobar and import "foobar/stuff"
[10:03:11] <opcode> i mean let's say i'm writing an api client and i have ~/code/client/main.go and go.mod... if I want to import some stuff that's under ~/code/client/api/ can ijust import "api"? I feel like that won't work
[10:03:49] *** Joins: arcatech (~arcatech@user/arcatech)
[10:04:06] * FenderQ tries to stick to the ~/go/src/projectname
[10:04:39] <FenderQ> with $GOPATH as ~/go
[10:04:42] <opcode> isn't the whole point of modules that you don't have to do that
[10:04:56] <FenderQ> I'm not sure, it really screwed me up as well
[10:05:03] <FenderQ> so we are in the same boat it seems
[10:05:06] <opcode> ugh
[10:05:23] <FenderQ> I had no problems prior to modules
[10:05:29] <FenderQ> since I understand how directories work
[10:05:49] <FenderQ> we're not alone on this one
[10:06:09] <FenderQ> automagically isn't helpful when it automagically doesn't work
[10:07:22] <rewt> opcode, if your project is in  ~/code/client/ and your go.mod has "project client", you can import ~/code/client/api/ as "client/api"
[10:07:51] *** Joins: gregf_ (~gregf@www.hugops.pw)
[10:07:56] <opcode> ok so you have to specify paths from go.mod's parent directory?
[10:07:56] <rewt> don't put your source code under $GOPATH
[10:08:05] <opcode> i don't have anything under $GOPATH
[10:08:15] <FenderQ> rewt: is $GOPATH no longer a thing at all?
[10:08:42] <rewt> FenderQ, afaik, it's only used to tell go where to install things when you go get
[10:08:57] <opcode> rewt: my go.mod has "module client"... is that equivalent
[10:09:14] <rewt> and where go mod puts its packages
[10:09:28] * FenderQ feels it is required to unlearn all the things to move forward
[10:09:31] <rewt> opcode, yeah, that's what i meant

[17:16:59] <mickey> i have some configuration that i load from a yaml file, and it has the definitions for some objects. i need to find a way to easily load these into the program. the "easy" way would be to load them into z = map[string]*x and then look them up by z["name"] but that kinda feels lame for some reason
[17:17:37] <mickey> i can't know the names in advance really, so i can't unmarshal that into an existing object :/ any idea what would be the better approach to go at it?
[17:17:45] <ikke> Is the structure pre-determined/
[17:18:16] <ikke> there are yaml modules that can load it into a struct
[17:18:37] <mickey> the structure is, yes. right now i have a var () with NAME = &x{all details}; ANOTHERNAME = &x{all details}; and so on
[17:18:50] <mickey> and i'm in the process of moving these definitions into a yaml
[17:19:37] <ikke> https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/yaml.v2
[17:20:13] <mickey> yes....?
[17:20:41] <mickey> i know how to unmarshal the yaml file. i'm asking in a more general way about how should i approach the structuring
[17:23:49] <ikke> It's a bit of an open-ended question

[17:25:42] <ikke> Do you know x,y,z in advance?
[17:26:01] <mickey> i know their structure (a: int, b: int). nothing else.
[17:26:33] <ikke> does the value of x, y, z mean anything?
[17:27:00] <mickey> you mean if "x" is different than "g"? nope. but i'm going to have to able to refer to x later on
[17:27:05] <mickey> to be able*
[17:27:19] <ikke> seems like a map is a good solution then
[17:27:47] <mickey> i suspected so. okay.
