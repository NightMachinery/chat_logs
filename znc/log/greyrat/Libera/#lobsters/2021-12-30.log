[04:42:28] <iDrougge> In Swift, most Collection types support ExpressibleByArrayLiteral or ExpressibleByDictionaryLiteral, so as long as you write out the type, that is the type you get when you initialise a value using a literal.

[05:45:42] <Ori_B> for post-1970s features, code style moves the needle about as far, if not farther.

[16:59:30] <amazigh> according to repology nixos has the largest set of software packaged.
[16:59:38] <amazigh> by a large margin
[16:59:43] <amazigh> I wonder how and why
[16:59:47] <kline> [x] doubt
[17:00:04] <gsora> repology is definitely wrong
[17:00:11] <kline> i find it doubtful somehow that nixos have packaged more software than debian or arch
[17:00:22] <kline> fedora probably has a larger set of packages as well
[17:00:27] <amazigh> arch too has similar number of packages
[17:00:55] <amazigh> nix and aur have twice as much as debian
[17:01:03] <amazigh> see top repositories at https://repology.org/
[17:01:59] <kline> it says it has "67943 projects"
[17:02:07] <kline> but in the unique column: 8874
[17:02:20] <gsora> lots of dupes?
[17:02:22] <kline> is every version considered a unique package?
[17:02:40] <kline> like, does nix produce a new package for every seen commit in the upstream repo?
[17:03:09] <kline> if so, it probably only has ~9k packaged projects but many dozens of builds for each
[17:03:22] <varjag> does it package npm packages too natively or
[17:04:25] <amazigh> unique means that it is only known to that package repository
[17:04:36] <kline> i have no idea how repology gets its numbers, but i just dont believe that nixos has 67,943 packaged software projects
[17:04:51] <amazigh> hence the interesting column is probably non-unique, which is says that the packaged software is at least known by another distro
[17:04:55] <kline> i dont think theres 70k foss projects worth packaging, even
[17:05:17] <amazigh> I think different versions means the same software

[17:05:41] <amazigh> same project
[17:06:22] <amazigh> well repology says otherwise :)
[17:06:44] <amazigh> 10K packages are unique in nix but still 60k packages are known to other repositories
[17:06:57] <amazigh> maybe that is just nix unstable
[17:07:06] <amazigh> nix stable may have much less packages

[20:47:19] <skrzyp> of course on unix we can simply prepare a package or deliver venv or just expect the user to bring its own shit, but on Windows if you deliver a simple utility tool one might expect to just double click on it, do the stuff, exit and forget about it

[20:52:18] <skrzyp> How the One-File Program Works
[20:52:20] <skrzyp> The bootloader is the heart of the one-file bundle also. When started it creates a temporary folder in the appropriate temp-folder location for this OS. The folder is named _MEIxxxxxx, where xxxxxx is a random number.
[20:52:22] <skrzyp> The one executable file contains an embedded archive of all the Python modules used by your script, as well as compressed copies of any non-Python support files (e.g. .so files). The bootloader uncompresses the support files and writes copies into the the temporary folder. This can take a little time. That is why a one-file app is a little slower to start than a one-folder app.
[20:52:24] <skrzyp> oh no
[20:52:44] <skrzyp> can't you just map your shit in memory

[20:53:29] <skrzyp> rust python?!
[20:53:34] <bkhl> That allows bundling your entire byte-compiled program into an executable.
[20:53:41] <bkhl> But that Python implementation isn't complete yet I think.
[20:53:55] <skrzyp> I mean, python implementation in rust or rust implementation in python?
[20:54:02] <skrzyp> I don't know what's worse

[20:55:16] <skrzyp> xD
[20:56:15] <reneeontheweb> i mean my experience is python libraries do a ton of janky stuff that make just dumping the bytecode potentially hazardous
[20:57:27] <bkhl> It kind of depends on you being able to bundle it with an also static build of the whole interpreter.
[20:57:37] <reneeontheweb> what with like conditional imports (or try: import foo / except ImportError), doing init stuff at the top level, stuff like that
[20:58:13] <bkhl> I feel like at this point effort would be better spent making it easier to distribute containers with end user applications, rather than re-inventing them as bundled apps.

[22:28:10] <banna> I think it's terrible on the notion that the format is only compatible with one platform
