That varies a bit depending upon which rib (the smaller ones at the bottom of the rib cage break easier than the thicker ones at the top of the rib cage). 250lbs might crack one, but it’s unlikely to break one.

[07:15:56] <Panther> I am not even sure what it would cause.
[07:16:50] <Panther> In the case of acute fluoride toxicity, one or a combination of the following symptoms such as gastric disturbances (nausea, vomiting occasionally with blood, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weakness, and hypocalcemia) are observed. These symptoms result in generalized or localized muscle tetany especially of hand and feet.

[07:47:34] <morf> it won't?!
[07:47:50] <morf> i'm disapointed, i'm glad i don't have any spare rooms 
[07:48:01] <morf> fucking normies can pay they own rent :|
[07:48:15] <Panther> Mostly mentally ill... they have no support services worth mentioning. Drug addicts have rehabs, long term treatments, halfway houses, etc....
[07:48:31] <morf> i dunno man
[07:48:48] <morf> but i saw the homeless streets in us, seems harsh

[07:49:30] <Panther> If you are homeless here in the US, get super drunk, and go to an ER and tell them you can't stop drinking and don't want to live anymore. Apart from anything else, if your BAC is over a certain level, they can't release you.
[07:49:31] <morlog> people with mental disabilities get left out of all the programs
[07:49:54] <Panther> And then they will find a rehab program to put you in.
[07:50:07] <Panther> morlog, yep, they get the shaft.
[07:50:18] <morlog> I'm one of em
[07:50:21] <morf> i saw reportage from one city, when was freezing, so they were trying get all homeless inside... and in that city there was like literally single person, that was claustrofobic, and couldn't and hate being inside, so he was outside sleeping under like 4 blankets checked twice a day by some charity ppl if he needs anything
[07:50:31] <morlog> bipolar and homeless
[07:50:54] <morf> i dunno we small country
[07:51:06] <Panther> Being bipolar will get you maybe 2 weeks in a ward, and then they will put you back out.
[07:51:13] <morf> :]
[07:51:26] <morlog> or shot
[07:51:29] <morf> do they give you at least some drugs to cope another 2 weeks? :]
[07:51:35] <Panther> Oh sure
[07:51:48] <morlog> they like to shoot people having mental breakdowns here
[07:51:55] <Panther> They will drug the crap out of you... 800mg of seroquel, no problemo.

[07:56:04] <morf> my friend is bipolar getting disability pension (lowest level 50% of max) 
[07:56:05] <Panther> That was where a guy bit me on the nose because I wouldn't give up my cell phone.
[07:56:15] <morf> not like you could pay a rent with it

[07:58:21] <morf> but i keep meeting crazy person here
[07:58:35] <Panther> Maybe he was hungry, and was trying to steal the phone to sell for food, so he decided to take a snack out of me instead.
[07:58:40] <morf> like some girl was screaming she can't take it anymore for 3 hours on the tram station 
[07:58:57] <morf> but i don't want to engage with person like that or call police "to help them" 
[07:59:12] <morf> or ppl keep buming me for cigs
[07:59:19] <morlog> almost Everytime I go downtown here I end up having to fight people off
[07:59:28] <Panther> I might have just asked her what it was that she couldn't take anymore.

[08:03:39] <morf> looks like weird movie for sure
[08:03:53] <morf> in to the bookmarks with it
[08:04:27] <morf> sent to friends maybe they will watch it instead of me :P
[08:04:43] <Panther> "for fans of wild science fiction, the film is a trippy examination of what happens when intellect overpowers humanity and humans taste immortality".

[08:04:57] <morf> even here where we have like "working social system" 
[08:05:11] <morf> it takes up to 3 months which is way too long to get being taken care of
[08:05:29] <Panther> It took me 3 years to be approved for disability.
[08:05:33] <morf> h
[08:05:34] <morf> yeah 
[08:05:40] <morf> probably could be the same
[08:06:02] <morf> or having debts + insurance you can't pay
[08:06:04] <Panther> an application, a reapplication, an appeal, and a court hearing.
[08:06:19] <morf> they don't even pay first repayment ... but the second and you have to proove everything 
[08:06:52] <morf> it's about $50 for my worst loan 
[08:07:04] <morf> no point paying it
[08:07:16] <morf> also i other insurance thing
[08:07:43] <Panther> I love the insurance I have.. I have the best medical care in the World.
[08:07:45] <morf> you can buy new phone & insure it ... but they don't pay anything... for example if you by your own drop the phone by accident they won't pay the damage :))) 
[08:07:58] <morf> you did that by negligance 
[08:08:13] <morf> only if some other person strucked into you, then it's accident (lol) 
[08:08:33] <morf> Panther, which insurance is that?
[08:08:41] <morf> what*
[08:11:01] <Panther> medicais
[08:11:06] <Panther> -s+d
[08:11:56] <Panther> I have assembled a great team of doctors, and if you can medically justify it, that insurance will pay for just about anything.
[08:12:34] <Panther> Right now, I am trying to get a 3T MRI of the deep gluteal region.
[08:13:35] <morf> :|
[08:13:41] <Panther> It's the best resolution for the nerves other than a MR neurography, and they don't have one of those here. :(
[08:13:53] <morf> we have here some special treatment 
[08:14:18] <morf> but you have to pay like $5k to get all the examinations you need
[08:14:28] <Panther> Most of the MRI magnets are about 1.8T or so, which is good, but 3T is much better.

[13:38:16] <Rashad> So his genes were like "you've got no chance, "Dr". However, we will not touch anything on the sides or the bottom."

[23:53:54] <artao> [13:59] <artao> shit!@ a knob came off my keystep pro 
[23:53:55] <artao> [13:59] <artao> can't find it
[23:53:55] <artao> [14:00] <artao> while trying to find it, i found a nearly full pack of cugs
[23:53:56] <artao> [14:00] <artao> cigs
[23:53:56] <artao> [14:00] <artao> :\
[23:53:57] <artao> [14:02] <artao> i'm pretty sure it JUST happened while i was dusting it off with a towel. i think the towel ripped it off. but where it landed? no idea
[23:53:57] <artao> [14:02] <artao> i know i didn't hear it land, so it most likely landed on a soft surface
[23:53:58] <artao> [14:02] <artao> which is the entire floor LOL
[23:53:58] <artao> [14:02] <artao> fFUCK :\
[23:53:59] <artao> [14:02] <artao> <sigh>
[23:56:48] <louipc> you'll find it next year or something
