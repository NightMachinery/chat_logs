[00:56:38] <BaronVladimirHar> Firefox doesn't even respect the unchecking of the spam boxes in the settings, if you can even find them.
[00:57:06] <BaronVladimirHar> It pops open things advertising Mozilla VPN and then it turns out I had already unchecked the boxes it says will stop it from doing that.
[00:57:44] <jiffe> I've got both chrome and firefox on my system, when I google 'what is my ip address' in chrome I get the expected ip address, when I try in firefox I got something about an expired 4to6 tunnel and when I accept it I see an ipv6 address.  I never setup any kind of tunnel and I don't have an ipv6 address on my link so not sure what is going on here
[00:58:13] <BaronVladimirHar> They're behaving like Microsoft now, where every time you figure out where all of the buttons are to make it leave you alone, they come up with new boxes, or about:config stuff.
[00:58:45] <BaronVladimirHar> Wagering that the average user will never find it and can't be bothered to export all of their browser data to Brave and leave.

[01:07:44] <W> BaronVladimirHar, "now"? Firefox has been using dark patterns for at least a decade
[01:08:23] <BaronVladimirHar> It's gotten so bad that I can hardly stand it.
[01:08:32] <BaronVladimirHar> And sites are even dumber than the browser is.
[01:08:32] <W> it's the least worst, unfortunately
[01:08:55] <BaronVladimirHar> The bank that manages our 401(k) calls Firefox 91 ESR an outdated browser.
[01:08:56] <W> unless your balance of convenience-vs-user respect is very tilted towards the latter
[01:09:03] <BaronVladimirHar> It's the current ESR.
[01:09:12] <BaronVladimirHar> Firefox 95 is barely different.
[01:09:32] <BaronVladimirHar> Why would I use 95 other than to suppress outdated browser warnings when nothing substantial has changed?
[01:10:44] <BaronVladimirHar> Then I click to learn more.
[01:11:17] <BaronVladimirHar> And the bank says Firefox 52+ is okay and says I use Firefox 91 and "thanks for keeping your browser up to date!".

[04:45:38] <twsd> Hi
[04:46:30] <twsd> I'm on Fedora KDE. I created a .desktop file of a firefox profile and put in .local/share/applications. It has a different icon in the menu as intended but when I launch it, it has the same icon as firefox in the panel as if it were just another window of firefox.  System monitor shows my .desktop app as a separate application though. How to change the behaviour of the panel to show the profile as a different app?

[18:48:18] <Descartes> My firefox browser keeps getting stuck every time I try to enter or exit a website
[18:50:37] <mefistofeles> Descartes: have you tried with a fresh profile and without addons?
[18:50:49] <Descartes> No
[18:54:17] <Descartes> the problem started with Outlook
[18:54:27] <Descartes> I was trying to access my Hotmail
[18:55:47] <Descartes> This is what happened:  https://justpaste.it/8bkca

[18:56:45] <Descartes> I figure the first thing I should do is close or exit all the tabs then reboot Firefox, but I can' t even close any of the browser tabs
[18:57:10] <Descartes> The Firefox browser is stuck on all the websites
[18:59:02] <Descartes> I'm running Firefox 95.0.1+linuxmint1+tricia
[18:59:59] <Descartes> that's the last Firefox update I had installed about a week ago on Linux Mint 19.3 Cinnamon
[19:04:31] <mefistofeles> Descartes: can't even close the browser? what about killing hte process
[19:05:01] <Descartes> How would I kill the process?
[19:05:47] <mefistofeles> Descartes: well, I bet there should be some process monitor thing that can help
[19:05:52] <mefistofeles> or you can also kill it from the command line

[19:09:01] <Descartes> Wow, I can't even go to my homepage
[19:09:31] <Descartes> It's like the browser is completely frozen and stuck
[19:10:14] <Descartes> What about Troubleshoot mode?
[19:10:26] <labrador> kill the process man
[19:11:40] <Descartes> I can also refresh Firefox instead of going into troubleshooting mode
[19:12:11] <Descartes> I've never killed a process from the command line
[19:14:37] <Descartes> I wonder if I created the problem myself by clearing the cache of cookies while still logged onto those email sites
[19:14:54] <Descartes> I'm in troubleshooting mode now
[19:15:02] <Descartes> I just cleared the cache again
[19:20:10] <W> I'm afraid in the year 2021, software quality is on the level that you can simply expect any and all software to completely lock up or bug out at least occasionally, and must be prepared to kill stuff and restart it to get it working again
[19:20:23] <W> luckily, we're about to enter 2022 which will surely be different
[19:20:58] <xx> I've reached the stage where every app has its own physical computer with 64GB RAM
[19:21:08] <xx> the electricity consumption is horrible
[19:21:15] <xx> but at least one app crashing does not mess up anything else
[19:21:22] <xx> welcome to modern computing
[19:21:23] <W> I don't know about Linux window managers these days, but most operating systems have acknowledged this to the extent they monitor programs and tries to automatically give you the option to kill them when they get proper stuck
[19:24:07] <Descartes> I can refresh firefox again or clear the startup cache from troubleshooting mode
[19:25:24] <Descartes> Oh, I was using a VPN buit into FF as an addon
[19:26:07] <Descartes> I think it's Hoxx VPN and hiding my IP address
[19:26:32] <Descartes> I asked the VPN to pretend I'm from Germany
[19:27:14] <Descartes> You can choose any country you want, but it's just a free VPN
[19:28:33] <Descartes> the Hoxx VPN runs a WebRTC Leak Shield, but I probably don't need that because I'm already have the uBlock Origin and uMatrix addons
