[07:29:47] <krismatrix> Can't use string ("{
[07:29:47] <krismatrix>   "id": "cs_test_xxxxxa"...) as a HASH ref while "strict refs" in use
[07:30:00] <krismatrix> How do I go about debugging this? 
[07:30:13] <mst> krismatrix: the die will have given you the line number
[07:30:38] <mst> looks to me like you tried to use a json string as a hashref rather than the return from the decode_json() call
[07:30:40] <krismatrix> Hey mst...you are back? Haven't seen you in a while.
[07:31:32] <krismatrix> Well..i am trying to use Mojo::UserAgent to testout a stripe api. I get something back...but I don't know how to get the 'url' element that is several layers deep.
[07:31:36] <mst> I'm maybe somewhat back, we'll have to see how stupid my brain's being at me
[07:32:00] <mst> ok, how about we cut to the part where I've argued with you about this and you show me the code? :D
[07:32:07] <krismatrix> I am trying to do this. $tx->{res}->{content}->{asset}->{content}
[07:32:25] <mst> no
[07:32:29] <mst> that's never right
[07:32:44] <mst> if you're using internals instead of method calls your code is broken
[07:32:50] <mst> $tx->res->content etc.
[07:34:31] <krismatrix> hmm...
[07:34:55] <mst> more importantly, if it's json
[07:35:09] <krismatrix> That works up to $tx->res->content->asset  but then I need to go to ->content where it complains about can't locate object method 'content'
[07:35:13] <mst> why not just call $tx->res->json to parse the body content as json and get back an actual hashref ?
[07:35:23] <krismatrix> hmm..I can do that?

[07:35:40] <mst> ...
[07:36:01] <mst> look, mate, I might be wrong but at least try it? :P
[07:36:39] <mst> $tx->res is a Mojo::Message::Response which inherits Mojo::Message which has an ->json method so I think it should work
[07:36:47] <mst> pretty sure I've got code that does that too :D
[07:37:07] <krismatrix> It got me into the closest block that has 'url'. Now i need the url itself.
[07:37:21] <krismatrix> got it.
[07:38:52] *** Joins: rindolf (~shlomif@inkscape/dev/shlomif)
[07:39:04] <mst> yeah, so then you throw Data::Dumper at the json data and figure out where to get it out from
[07:39:18] <krismatrix> yep..I got it.
[07:39:38] <krismatrix> I guess I don't understand why $tx->res is fine but not $tx->{res} is not.
[07:40:05] <mst> because $tx->{res} is fucking around with undocumented, unsupported internals of the object in question
[07:40:06] <krismatrix> or more specifically $tx->res->json->url doesn't work but $tx->res->json->{url} works.
[07:40:15] <krismatrix> hmmm..
[07:40:19] <mst> because ->json returns a hashref not an object
[07:40:26] <mst> while it's an object, you call methods on it
[07:40:36] <mst> ->json returns pure data so then you can treat it as data
[07:40:43] <mst> treating somebody else's object as data is dangerous
[07:41:03] <mst> (sometimes you have to, but if you do have to, comment it because it's still dangerous)

[18:43:26] <timlegge> this plugin doesn't directly it needs a release to occur as it uses Dist::Zilla::Role::AfterRelease but FakeRelease works.
[18:45:08] <timlegge> mst: in this case  t/lib/MyTest/ may not work for me because I want to test the plugin on a pseudo real module where I can have the Dist::Zill release process tag the git repo and find any changes between tags
[18:45:54] <timlegge> Thanks for "talking it through" with me as I was fixated on the upload but forgot I did not really have to do that
[18:46:16] <mst> yeah, I see how it needs to be an actual dist for that
[18:46:18] <simcop2387> mst: it's a bit neat to take a dremel to server parts
[18:49:11] <timlegge> It's Dist::Zilla::Plugin::SignReleaseNotes and is very similar to Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Signature but creates a gpg signed release notes file that  contains the git commits between the most recent two tags and a sha hash of the file being uploaded to cpan
[18:49:39] <simcop2387> neat, didn't know that existed

[21:52:51] <timlegge> Since it just creates a local Release-{$VERSION} file it doesn't cause and major issues for me though
[21:55:01] <mst> I think I'd consider writing an xt/ file that uses File::Temp to spin up a tempdir and then creates a repo, copies a set of code across, drives git to do the needful then verifies the results

[23:18:42] <krismatrix> So I am trying to implement stripe payment system. I am doing the simple one where it redirects to stripe site, and when there is a success or failure I want it to redirect back to my website's success and failure page.
[23:19:19] <krismatrix> The problem is...how do I tell stripe (in development) to redirect back to localhost:3000/sucess and localhost:3000/failure. That is not on the web..lol
[23:20:13] <mst> I mean, my solution to this is normally "develop on a server"
[23:20:15] <mst> however
[23:20:41] <SpiceMan> I have no idea what stripe is, but if it doesn't have a developer mode, it sucks
[23:20:55] <SpiceMan> (where you can use those urls)
[23:21:16] <krismatrix> It DOES have a developer mode...if by that you mean they provide a developer mode public and secret keys to run tests.
[23:21:22] <mst> SpiceMan: point is you can't redirect back to a machine that's behind NAT easily

[23:23:38] <mst> note I can't vouch for which of these are best because, as I say, dev server
[23:24:04] <krismatrix> right.
[23:24:07] <mst> the only time I really develop locally is when I'm on a train/plane/etc. and don't have ssh access to my usual spot
[23:24:07] <SpiceMan> I'm not sure I follow. it's just an URL. resolving etc is on the client side, not the whatever api
[23:24:26] <SpiceMan> if it's just a redirect. if, on the other hand, it needs to post to that url or whatever, that's another story
[23:24:34] <SpiceMan> but he said redirect
[23:25:05] <mst> SpiceMan: the /success and /failure URLs suggest that stripe's POSTing to the app
[23:25:21] <SpiceMan> no, nothing suggested that to me.
[23:25:32] <SpiceMan> go to this url on success, to that in case of failure
[23:25:41] <mst> oh, perhaps, yeah
[23:26:30] <mst> honestly, given a choice between 'help krismatrix argue with stripe configuration' and 'give krismatrix a bunch of options that have general use and mean I don't even have to think about stripe', option two seemed by far the more tempting :D
[23:27:44] <krismatrix> I think mst is on the right track...I am not sure I get what SpiceMan is getting at about how to get stripe to make things work.
[23:28:00] <SpiceMan> I mean, last API I've used that did something like that was auth0. you just POST to their URL with { callback_url: "http://localhost:3000/success" } or something
[23:28:11] <SpiceMan> and it GETs that URL with ?token=FOO
[23:28:17] <SpiceMan> no need to post -> works
[23:28:30] <mst> yeah, SpiceMan has a good point that if it's literally a 302 redirect back to your app then the fact it isn't on the internet doesn't matter
[23:28:35] <SpiceMan> (and the api has to have that host on a blacklist)
[23:28:46] <mst> krismatrix: did you actually try it or did you just assume it wouldn't work? :D
[23:29:03] <mst> (and if you did try it, why didn't you tell us what you tried and what happened *shakes fist* ;)
[23:29:15] <SpiceMan> so... my point is no matter how much cloudflare you put into it... if the "callback url" isn't whitelisted, it wont work.
[23:29:22] <krismatrix> I DID try it...and I got a 302 in my_app/log/development.log
[23:29:22] <SpiceMan> depending on how the API works
[23:30:15] <krismatrix> give me a bit...i'll see if I can share...but it will take me a few minutes...
