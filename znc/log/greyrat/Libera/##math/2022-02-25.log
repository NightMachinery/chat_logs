[21:57:29] <maroon> thanks int-e, and also related is that i'm told that using a different 'g' to make the public key won't immunize to GNFS which solved when g=2. does that apply only to 'g that creates order=q, or also solves same prime used with a 'g' having Order=p-1?
[21:57:36] <int-e> sorry, x^2 = y (mod p); x^2 = y^2 (mod N) is what we want for factoring an N.
[21:58:19] <int-e> maroon: Of course it won't. If you've solved it for base 2, you can write the different g as a power of 2.
[21:58:20] <maroon> ie, does the attack depend on 'p' or on the Order

[21:59:33] <int-e> so after computing two discrete logs with base 2, g^x = m becomes (2^a)^x = 2^b (mod p) and you can solve ax = b (mod p-1) to find x.

[22:24:49] <isekaijin> I guess there's a cultural mismatch between math, where we won't answer your question unless it's sufficiently precise (not just because we don't want to, but simply because we *can't*), and the outside world, where consultants are supposed to figure out what the client means, even if the client isn't being clear.
[22:24:52] <Galois> <Z-module> rah, so far your question is vastly too open-ended. It's on you to give us what properties you want the map to have.
[22:25:11] <rah> Galois: nowhere in that question are the words "a valid statement"
[22:25:40] <rah> Galois: Z-module didn't ask me for anything, he stated an expectation that I should give the people of this channel something
[22:25:49] <Galois> I understand that that part was not clear. I will now make it clear what Z-module meant. The reason Z-module asked for what properties you want is because you did not provide any valid statement of said properties.
[22:26:09] <Galois> you are splitting hairs if you insist on a distinction between stating and asking.
[22:26:27] <Galois> Regardless, I explicitly ask, right now, for what mathematical properties you want.
[22:26:37] <rah> I don't know, that's why I'm here
[22:26:55] <isekaijin> How is anyone supposed to help you if you don't know what you want?
[22:27:02] <Galois> ok, then, why is a space-filling curve not a good enough property?
[22:27:41] <Galois> after all, it does indeed map 3D to 1D in a way that cannot be reduced to a single dimension
[22:27:54] <rah> isekaijin: I would expect there would be a limited selection of solutions for the general problem I've illustrated; elucidating the possibilities would help
[22:28:10] <rah> isekaijin: telling me what properties would be possible would help
[22:28:14] <Galois> you are completely wrong. There are vastly more solutions than what we can describe.
[22:29:05] <Galois> There are unimaginably many 1:1 functions. There are unimaginably many continuous functions. (There are zero functions with both properties. And you should know what these properties mean.)
[22:29:14] <Galois> You have given almost nothing to narrow the space down.
[22:29:18] <rah> Galois: but presumably those solutions could be categorised or otherwise treated in a general manner that could be summarised in a helpful way
[22:29:30] <Galois> yes, that's called "math"
[22:29:37] <rah> for example "1:1 functions" is a category
[22:29:40] <Galois> There are differentiable functions
[22:29:48] <Galois> There are linear transformations.
[22:29:57] <Galois> There are C^1 functions, C^2 functions, ...

[22:30:13] <Galois> each of those ... goes on forever

[22:30:24] <Galois> and I haven't even listed but a small fraction of what we can describe

[22:30:50] <rah> these don't sound like functions that would be useful in the domain I've illustrated, they just seem like categories of functions in general

[22:32:00] <Galois> and we've given you uncountably many ways to do this, which you refuse to accept, but you won't tell us why our proposals aren't acceptable.
[22:32:04] <rah> isekaijin: at the moment I have no way to map a 3D direction onto a 1D range

[22:32:20] <Galois> false. Speed. Space-filling curve. You have ways.

[22:37:18] <rah> isekaijin: I'm not sure what you mean by "distinct" in this context, but otherwise yes
[22:37:44] <rah> CMY is not hue, it's all of hue, saturation and intensity, just like RGB
[22:37:47] <isekaijin> rah: It means that, if p and q are different points of X, then f(p) and f(q) are different points of Y.

[22:38:16] <Galois> every hue, saturation, and intensity
[22:38:39] <isekaijin> rah: btw, that part is key... If you don't mind f(p) and f(q) potentially being equal for distinct points p and q, then it's easy to construct f.
[22:38:48] <rah> isekaijin: sounds like you're describing a 1:1 function which I would like but do not require
[22:38:52] <Galois> if RGB works for you then just map xyz to RGB
[22:38:59] <isekaijin> rah: Oh.
[22:39:55] <isekaijin> rah: Okay, it's good to know that this isn't a hard requirement, because no continuous function f can fulfill it. (If you want to actually compute f, then it pretty much has to be continuous.)

[23:43:13] <z6np-6w> you guys feed him too many chocolate cantor turtles?
[23:45:03] <z6np-6w> angles can always be represented as cosines but you lose absolute rotations and just deal with the resultant

[23:45:36] <z6np-6w> pi/4 is equiv to sqrt(2)/2 as a cosine
[23:45:41] <river> I feel that i should really study alg top
[23:45:46] <river> I always hated it, such ugly math

[23:45:51] <river> but i believe it is important math...
[23:46:21] <z6np-6w> its hard, i've been trying to learn how to use sat-solver packages myself river
[23:46:28] <errst> Is the question too ambiguous or is it because that I am a beginner and don't understand the question? :)
[23:46:30] <river> oh that sounds pretty cool!
[23:46:39] <river> errst: it is very ambiguous yes
[23:46:49] <river> sat solvers are very hi tech and powerful
[23:47:14] <river> I wrote a trival one that just used the most basic watched literals approach
[23:47:22] <river> but real sat solvers do amazing stuff
[23:47:24] <int-e> *using* sat solvers isn't supposed to be hard

[23:48:20] <z6np-6w> i'm a gentoo penguin and their dependency resolver would benefit from a canned sat-solver instead of ad-hoc python but the complexity of the graph is astounding
[23:48:29] <errst> river: Ah, good. I started to questioning myself, lol.
[23:48:41] <river> ahh nice
[23:49:00] <river> i saw someone hacked together a sudoku solver based on creating a bunch of fake packages with a web of weird dependencies
[23:49:21] <int-e> ...of course people would do that.

[23:49:42] <z6np-6w> gentoo has all these USE flags and other things that create cross-links to the n-tree
[23:50:14] <alphamule2> Reading backlog... I feel like we're talking in a different language entirely, or rah needs to find the dictionary for regional dialect.  XD

[23:50:21] <z6np-6w> if it was just a tree structure that would be much more manageable
[23:51:52] <z6np-6w> i've kicked the idea around about using a sat solver with some of the other devs but that would be quite a feat, kinda like a brain transplant on a living patient :D

[23:53:35] <z6np-6w> graph optimization is something computers are good at that people aren't
[23:54:38] <z6np-6w> i took a discrete math course one time, it touched on that topic for a week or so
[23:55:04] <z6np-6w> every node on a graph is discrete
[23:55:06] <alphamule2> river:  I was thinking it was pigeon-holed because... he wants to take 24 bit data and fit into an 8-bit hole
[23:55:11] <int-e> I really think that using a SAT solver isn't all that scary, assuming you have a nice enough domain where solutions naturally map to boolean variables, and constraints to boolean formulas.

[23:55:18] <alphamule2> i.e. Not gonna work
[23:55:40] <int-e> Most SAT solver operate on set clauses; the gap to arbitrary boolean formulas is bridged by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tseytin_transformation
[23:55:43] <alphamule2> Easter Egg, LOL, "randomly colored"
[23:55:53] <river> alphamule2: i mean its exactly the same idea as pigeon hole - totally the right intuition
[23:56:04] <river> but technically speaking pigeon hole only works with finite things
[23:56:18] <int-e> (And there are libraries for that. Or you can use an SMT solver, all of which handle boolean formulas.)
[23:56:20] <river> oh yeah true
[23:56:29] <river> if you are talking about finite bit representations
[23:56:41] <river> then literally is pigeonhole, that proves you can't invert the function
[23:56:46] <z6np-6w> alphamule2, it might be an entropic sphere where the coloration varies with time
[23:56:47] <river> good point
[23:57:04] <alphamule2> I was thinking in color space terms, using a finite number of bits.  XD
[23:59:08] <alphamule2> Is that Sudoku solver thing like those "compute using pcompiler's parser" things?
[23:59:23] <z6np-6w> e^(n*pi*i)  n [0..2] maps to an angle in radians [0..2pi]
[23:59:39] <alphamule2> i.e. uniintended application
