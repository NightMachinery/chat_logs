[13:45:42] <xispita> hello guys, in the lastest release 2021.11.10.1 I got error when try to use the same conversion as before ERROR: "libvorbis" (after download the audio and try to use ffmpeg to speed up to 2x) tried with a previous version yt-dlp 2021.11.10 and worked just fine like the older version I am been using, anyone tried this way ?
[14:07:47] <opal> that doesnt seem like a complete error message
[14:22:55] <xispita> yes was just a fast example without debug the thing I just downloaded the old version and worked fine
[14:27:49] <xispita> with verbose
[14:27:54] <xispita> [debug] Custom config: ['-c', '-f', '251/250/140', '-x', '--audio-format', 'vorbis', '-o', '%(uploader)s %(title)s-%(id)s 2x.%(ext)s', '--exec', 'mv {} temp; ffmpeg -i temp -af silenceremove=stop_periods=-1:stop_duration=1:stop_threshold=-40dB,atempo=2.00,volume=1.65 {} ; rm temp']
[14:30:46] <xispita> opal, full verbose https://ghostbin.com/Qc3qX
[14:31:08] <xispita> Now I will try with the previous version
[14:34:39] <xispita> opal, working all good with the previous version -> https://ghostbin.com/QZYfk
[14:35:54] <xispita> it's enough or need any other tests ? If you need anything more just tell what to do
[14:47:56] <opal> wow it really does just say error: libvorbis
[14:47:56] <opal> lmao
[14:49:37] <opal> ~ wowaname@mahin> yt-dlp --version
[14:49:37] <opal> 2021.09.25
[14:49:40] <opal> shit mine's real old
[14:50:07] <xispita> yeah I was using the same version but after the update to the new release I saw that error
[14:50:54] <opal> i'll see what i run into
[14:51:10] <opal> my immediate guess is maybe ffmpeg isnt built with libvorbis support but idk if thats your issue
[14:54:54] <opal> limits = {
[14:54:54] <opal>     'libmp3lame': (10, 0),
[14:54:54] <opal>     'libvorbis': (0, 10),
[14:54:54] <opal>     # FFmpeg's AAC encoder does not have an upper limit for the value of -q:a.
[14:54:54] <opal>     # Experimentally, with values over 4, bitrate changes were minimal or non-existent
[14:54:54] <opal>     'aac': (0.1, 4),
[14:54:54] <opal>     'libfdk_aac': (1, 5),
[14:54:55] <opal> }.get(codec)
[14:55:10] <opal> is the libvorbis key in that python file at all for you
[14:59:29] <opal> ~ wowaname@mahin> yt-dlp --version
[14:59:29] <opal> 2021.11.10.1
[14:59:30] <opal> shiny
[15:00:00] <opal> yeah i can play stuff fine
