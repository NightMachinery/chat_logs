[05:58:49] <sm1> hmm. You must be right, but I'm surprised because sed -E is posix ERE, and https://www.regular-expressions.info says "support for \d, \s, and \w is quite universal"
[05:59:07] <emanuele6> if it says that, it is wrong.
[05:59:09] <emanuele6> !ere
[05:59:10] <greybot> Extended Regular Expressions. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/RegularExpression or (POSIX) https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap09.html#tag_09_04 or https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/regex.7.html
[05:59:12] <e36freak> yeah, that's wrong as fuck
[05:59:20] <sm1> for some reason I'm having a hard time finding the description of regex flavours that used to be on this site
[05:59:23] <e36freak> none of those are supported by either POSIX flavor of RE
[05:59:40] <sm1> good to know, thanks
[06:00:12] <sm1> ah, on https://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.html
[06:01:34] <e36freak> see the links emanuele6 gave you for POSIX re
[06:01:38] <e36freak> there's not much to them
[06:02:55] <sm1> I will check those out. I'm very fond of this site too. I suspect GNU sed actually uses GNU Extended Regular Expressions, which add \w but not \d to POSIX ERE
[06:03:17] <e36freak> correct
[06:03:27] <sm1> what were you thinking GNU dude
[06:03:35] <e36freak> section 5.6 in the sed info page for the extensions
[06:03:50] <e36freak> i tend to just stick to POSIX regex for sed, personally
[06:03:55] <emanuele6> \d is not that useful since [[:digit:]] exists
[06:04:03] <e36freak> also true
[06:04:28] <sm1> ah I see that works. TIL, thank you

[11:02:00] <kurahaupo1> stevenm_: If you want to be sure that you can just use "return", then make sure that the conditional operator before it is "||", and if necessary invert the sense of the test

[11:03:54] <kurahaupo1> stevenm_: the points in that stackoverflow post are not to recommend against using "return", they're to point out that an explicit number, without a comment, can easily be misunderstood by novices as having the opposite effect of what it actually does

[11:07:54] <stevenm_> they *stay* :P
[11:08:01] <kurahaupo1> consider what happens when you have foo() { local -n a=$1 ; ... } ... foo a
[11:09:46] <kurahaupo1> If you're going to use local -n, please use a LONG variable name that's unlikely to clash with any other use, for example « local -n __index_aray_arg1="$1" »
[11:10:19] <stevenm_> generally no one uses single letter variables unless its in scripts and it's something like 'i' used in for (for example)
[11:10:31] <stevenm_> so since *I* know which single letter variables are used globally and which are not
[11:10:33] <stevenm_> I'm safe
[11:11:16] <llua> famous last words from the person unware of the problems 5 mins ago
[11:11:21] <geirha> single letter names are fine for regular variables, but namerefs will get you name collitions
[11:11:35] <kurahaupo1> stevenm_: Short names for variables that have very short scope is actively encouraged in some languages, since it makes it easier to read the code. However « local -n » imposes a functional requirement that overrides stylistic preferences and even "best practice" styles
[11:11:44] <stevenm_> also 'local -n' eh? presumably 'local -n a=$1 -n b=$2' does the same as 'local a b; declare -n a=$1 b=$2'  ?
[11:11:57] <kurahaupo1> Yes, it does
[11:12:23] <kurahaupo1> Actually, inside a function "local" and "declare" do the same thing
[11:12:26] <geirha> but local doesn't save you from name collitions when you use namerefs
[11:12:32] <stevenm_> llua, that I was already aware of - but since no one was saying what problem they were on about (just saying "ugh") then I'm not a mind reader
[11:14:01] <ormaaj> This language is rittled with quirks. You need to consider every edge case before assuming it will be fine.
[11:14:13] <stevenm_> to a point
[11:14:21] <kurahaupo1> geirha: ormaaj: do either of you remember whether there's any functional difference between declare, local, and typeset, other than local being forbidden when not in a function?

[11:18:18] <stevenm_> anyone want to see my function for listing out an array... it supports the oxford comma :P
[11:18:36] <ormaaj> kurahaupo1: In bash i believe they are identical. typeset is only relevent when you need ksh compatibility and then there's a lot more to consider due to ksh93 static scope rules etc.
[11:19:07] <kurahaupo1> which is to say, typedef in Bash is incompatible with typedef in ksh?
[11:19:40] <kurahaupo1> (which ought to be a good reason to avoid it when the differences would break your code)
[11:20:38] <llua> people used to it will continue to use it
[11:20:40] <ormaaj> roughly? declare doesn't work at all so if you go that route you're choosing to live without locals.

[11:28:57] <stevenm_> <kurahaupo1> Whenever anyone suggests "we should fix this language", the answer is "Perl is <- thataway, and Python is -> thataway"
[11:29:17] <stevenm_> and I agree... but even in those languages... scripts have been written to target the functions of a specific version of those interpreters
[11:29:36] <stevenm_> and additionally if someone forked perl... or made a perl-like language... you wouldn't expect it to work
[11:30:07] <stevenm_> so why on earth do shell-knowledgable-people (hello everyone)... seem SO keen on making everything portable between a whole raft of stuff that just isn't going to be the same
[11:30:12] <ormaaj> perl and python are absolutely unrelated languages.
[11:30:20] <stevenm_> I'm not saying they are related
[11:30:34] <stevenm_> re-read, you've missed the point I'm making
[11:32:15] <stevenm_> I see the same thing with sed... people wanting their regex to work on *all* versions of sed.  It's silly!
[11:32:37] <stevenm_> if you call 'sed' - you better know what EXACTLY is that edition/version of sed :P
[11:32:42] <ormaaj> You can do version checking in shell.
[11:33:09] <stevenm_> otherwise the lesser sed-like command or lesser sh-like interpreter... will bring down the functionality of them all
[11:33:40] <ormaaj> I expect sed interoperability
[11:33:47] <ormaaj> generally
[11:33:55] <geirha> stevenm_: so we should create one script per OS if we want a script to be able to run on multiple systems?

If people argue that they're doing so "because it's a string", then I take that as an even stronger reason to recommend that they avoid doing so, because they're quite misguided if they think that "strings" are somehow different from any other kind of data in the shell

[20:46:36] <transhumanist> Hi! bash wizards! I come hear with all my hard questions. This one is a bit easier, I use dd if=/dev/sda | gzip >/mnt/backup/<some-backup-image> I would like to handle errors gracefully and also have a progress bar. Is this possible? Thanks in advance for your time
[20:47:19] <transhumanist> oh and have it report the errors, so I know they were there
[20:47:20] <kurahaupo1> transhumanist: </dev/sda pv | gzip > image.gz
[20:47:35] <kurahaupo1> What kind of errors are you expecting?
[20:47:48] <transhumanist> its usb disks so I am expecting spot errors I guess
[20:48:58] <transhumanist> the usb disks are getting large so I am expecting to encounter more and more problems as time goes on when doing this
[20:49:11] <kurahaupo1> SSD drives always use sector mapping, so that they can have a pool of erased sectors immediately available whenever you write to it; erasure of the old sectors can go on in the background. Failed sectors are locked out automatically.
[20:49:49] *** Joins: anaveragehuman (~anaverage@user/anaveragehuman)
[20:49:53] <transhumanist> I take it thumb drives dont have this feature?
[20:50:21] <kurahaupo1> Of course they do. It's inherent in the way that SSD works (in any size range)
[20:50:56] <transhumanist> I mean usb thumb drives , its flash which is different tech isnt it?.
[20:50:57] <kurahaupo1> To be fair, you could buy a cheap one that has a small ratio of spare sectors; just avoid doing that
[20:51:43] <kurahaupo1> The "flash" part is about needing to flash-erase a whole sector before it can be written to. That's the same for almost all solid-state storage systems other than DRAM

[20:52:04] <transhumanist> can I format it with extra spare sectors?
[20:52:25] <kurahaupo1> No, that's fixed by the firmware in the device, unless it comes with a special driver.
[20:52:39] <transhumanist> ok then any brand you recommend then?
[20:53:08] <kurahaupo1> Anyway, to answer your question, dd will report the failed sector when reading or writing; everything else will just report IO error and maybe which file or device

[21:01:49] <kurahaupo1> "dd" is often presented as a mysterious command that you "have to" use when dealing with devices, but in reality, dd, cat and pv all do the same thing when you don't tell them the names of any files: they read data from stdin and write that data to stdout. Even "tr" will do that if you don't tell it to replace or delete any characters.

[22:10:32] <geirha> that's both sed injection *and* shell injection
