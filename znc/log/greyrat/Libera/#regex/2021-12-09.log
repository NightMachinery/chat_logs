[07:14:37] <re101-tetra-31> Hi y'all. I've been wracking my brain here for a few hours and wondering if I'm just approaching something the wrong way entirely.
[07:17:04] <re101-tetra-31> I've got strings that fit have periods in them as delimiters. Trouble is, I don't want to match the periods if they're contained within parentheses. So in the case of: `Object.SomeValue(type:Three.OneFour, name:Pi)`, I really only want to match that first period.
[07:17:04] <re101-tetra-31> Of course, there's a variable number of arguments here, and there could be multiple subtypes before we hit the arguments.
[07:18:12] <digitok> which programming language are you using

[07:24:36] <re101-tetra-31> https://regex101.com/r/jNdGo4/1
[07:25:13] <digitok> so, can we assume that every . that you want to match will be followed by a ( ?
[07:25:22] <digitok> and that the same pattern will not occur within ( ) ?

[07:26:18] <re101-tetra-31> We can't assume that there will always be parentheses in the input string
[07:26:28] <digitok> ok
[07:27:52] <digitok> do we need to worry about nested parenthesis
[07:27:59] <re101-tetra-31> Nope
[07:28:08] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/jNdGo4/2
[07:28:53] <digitok> this checks that the . is not followed by a ) that has no ( before it
[07:29:41] <re101-tetra-31> Interesting. I think I see where my approach was funky -- I was trying to negate the match between the entire parens group
[07:30:44] <digitok> yep, also lookaheads look directly ahead from the current position
[07:31:05] <digitok> so if the next character is not \( then it will match
[07:31:52] <digitok> pcre supports something similar to what you were trying to do
[07:32:06] <digitok> https://regex101.com/r/jNdGo4/3
[07:32:36] <digitok> this matches (...) and then causes that match to fail while keeping the internal cursor positioned at the end of that match
[07:33:47] <re101-tetra-31> AFAIK Swift doesn't support PCRE syntax
[07:34:45] <digitok> yea, probably not. it was mostly just an example of how to do something like what you were attempting
[07:36:01] <re101-tetra-31> Either way, I really appreciate the help. Days like today make me wish I paid a bit more attention when I was taking Perl + Regex in college ðŸ˜¬

[12:45:40] <kirua> hello
[12:45:55] <kirua> i want to select the 43 first charachters, i tried this but no luck : /.*?{0,43}/
[12:46:43] <kirua> then 55 until the end of the line
[12:46:55] <kirua> in two times obviously 
[12:48:32] <Me-me> What do you mean, then 55 until the end of the line?
[12:50:57] <re101-weasel-29> Can you help me in extracting dateÂ  '2020-01-01' this from string 'product-breakdown-history-load-2020-01-01-2020-01-02-1005389890.json'
[12:51:15] <Me-me> !date
[12:51:26] <Me-me> Tch, I thought that was a preset command.
[12:51:41] <Me-me> weasel: The easy way is \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}
[12:52:36] <Me-me> kirua: Well when you feel like answering, the quick problem with your pattern is that *? and {0,43} are both quantifiers - you can use one or the other, not both.
[12:53:08] <Me-me> You could even use {0,43}? if you wanted, though if that's the whole pattern that wouldn't make sense because it would always stop at 0.
[12:55:39] <kirua> so this does the trick : .{43,43}?
[12:55:44] <kirua> but what's the explanation behind it ?
[12:56:13] <Me-me> So you can simplify that further to {43}
[12:56:33] <Me-me> Basically, you're specifying a range. {min,max}
[12:56:54] <Me-me> If you leave the maximum out, you get as many as possible after the minimum.
[12:57:24] <Me-me> ? is the same as {0,1}
[12:57:29] <Me-me> * is the same as {0,}
[12:57:35] <Me-me> + is the same as {1,}
[12:58:14] <kirua> thanks for the explanation
[12:58:26] <kirua> now i want to select from the 12th position to the end of the linde
[12:58:34] <kirua> and that's trickier
[12:58:56] <Me-me> ^.{11}(.+)$
[12:59:22] <kirua> because it's not just a matter of min or max, it has to start at a certain position
[13:00:06] <kirua> ^.{11}(.+)$ gets the whole which is 34 characters long
[13:00:21] <Me-me> But the contents of capture group 1 are the string you want.
[13:01:13] <kirua> i want to get rid of the last part
[13:01:21] <kirua> so i can rearrange my file
[13:01:54] <Me-me> s/^(.{11}).+/$1/
[13:01:55] <rebot> 14Me-me meant: 07$1
[13:02:00] <Me-me> s/^(.{11}).+/\1/
[13:02:01] <rebot> 14Me-me meant: 07But the con
[13:02:13] <Me-me> So you'll want to use $1, not \1, because the bot is out of sate.
[13:02:18] <Me-me> *out of date
[13:02:42] <Me-me> But you'll notice that what it did was exactly what you want - it took the first 11 characters and deleted the rest.

[17:16:51] <digitok> well, i see maybe 3 options to do it purely with regex
[17:17:17] <digitok> more like 2, actually
[17:17:21] <dnordenberg> ok
[17:17:37] <digitok> one would return the 7 letters and possibly the . which would need to be removed
[17:17:55] <digitok> and the other would be a replacement that removes the . and the excess chars

[17:18:58] <dnordenberg> and in the first case I guess I will have to count on it to get 7 characters in the end?
