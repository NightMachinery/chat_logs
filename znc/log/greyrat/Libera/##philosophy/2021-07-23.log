[00:20:17] <bougyman> I thought they called the Exctacy
[00:20:35] <bougyman> I guess it's not contagious.
[00:21:55] <DPA> That also seams to have a lot of side effects in that context.

[15:34:34] <kmh> spruit11,  na
[15:35:14] <kmh> spruit11,  for river floods they switched to removing embankment and provide the river with flood plains
[15:36:03] <spruit11> yes,  sure.  I know that
[15:36:30] <kmh> meanigthe defense against river flodding isn't scaling up (like for sea protection but rather let flood areas in a controlled manner)
[15:44:06] <DPA> In Switzerland, the preparation we did after the last flood seem to have worked quiet well this time. There were some smaller floodings where they where supposed to happen, but no major damage like last time.
[15:44:38] <spruit11> nono,  it's scaling up towards a more comprehensive strategy.  most water management originally started as local projects,  and that is driven towards a national (or inter-national) approach due to necessity
[15:44:49] <spruit11> don't know about the funding
[15:46:12] <spruit11> but the history is something like a medieval farmer extending his plot on the sea,  towards canals,  polders and dikes,  and now a more national approach

[22:15:46] *** Joins: Treefingers (~Glassbox@103.162.189.80.dyn.plus.net)
[22:22:44] <pussipupu> The wobble might be normal and rising sea levels the issue
[22:23:11] <pussipupu> based entirely on a Torygraph headline I didn't get round to following up
[22:23:59] <bougyman> Sea level has been rising since the last glaciation.
[22:24:20] <bougyman> It won't stop rising until we're headed to the next one.
[22:24:34] <bougyman> Which should be 10-50k years.
[22:24:50] <bougyman> Climate models disasgree wildly on that.
[22:25:17] <hovercat> well the climate is a variable of the moon and it's tidal pull...
[22:25:25] <bougyman> We know it's coming, just don't know when. And those which take AGW into account are on the long end (50k years) while those that use the Russian model are more towards 10k years.
[22:26:08] <hovercat> not saying we are going into apocalypse, just saying more and more flooding, especially in coastal regions or river bound areas is to be expected.

[22:30:25] <pussipupu> Do you make any good cheeses in the Netherlands?
[22:30:32] <hovercat> well this all has been forecasted, but the article I saw a few days ago suggested the moon wobble will usher it in at an accelerated rate not expected

[23:36:07] <Parf> yes, definitely. but latin seems like the perfect language to "force yourself to learn", or esperanto maybe
[23:36:10] <Parf> or lojban
[23:36:31] <zicada> i bet part of that is people learn to like Latin as they grow older
[23:36:32] <Parf> like a purely academic pursuit of language is different from a serviceable one you learn to communicate with your mother
[23:36:41] <pussipupu> I might try to pick up a sign language if we don't carry on with Latin
[23:36:47] <Parf> yes, opsimathy makes a difference
[23:36:59] <zicada> it never occurs to young people that Latin is a good idea, for obvious reasons
[23:37:15] <pussipupu> which wasn't my first choice anyway to be honest, it's not especially interesting to me featurally
[23:37:39] <Parf> in terms of influencing popularity. well hell, latin doesn't seem "fun". usually people learn a language to suit a purpose after they get to a certain age. very few children have needs that are only met with something written in latin, except maybe a few geniuses
[23:37:44] <Parf> and those of course must be cultivated
[23:37:49] <zicada> i imagine if i knew even basic latin, various other sciences would be more straight forward

[23:39:04] <Parf> well, why not learn french, italian and spanish?
[23:39:21] <Parf> as i've grown older, french seems more and more appealing
[23:39:44] <zicada> and those are rather different, the closest by far to the original is Romanian
[23:39:44] <zicada> Romanian is to Italian as Icelandic is to Norwegian
[23:40:01] <zicada> Parf: if you learn Latin, you have a much easier time learning all 3

[23:42:14] <zicada> and roots
[23:42:29] <zicada> and Alps has a lot of interesting stuff
[23:42:37] <zicada> including Romansch
[23:43:15] <Parf> i just mean why fill your head with all that if you just want to learn a particular language
[23:43:29] <Parf> i get foundational preparation, but you're not in your foundational years, apparently,
[23:43:41] <Parf> so it might be more prudent to learn the goal language instead of the buffer
[23:44:18] <zicada> another weird Latin thing with more German mix
[23:44:19] <zicada> well, i dont want to learn a particular language, i want to learn about languages and how they develop over time
[23:44:19] <zicada> and i like Manga and Anime and Japanese culture and i love the tone and sound of Japanese, so im very biased to learning that
[23:44:51] <Parf> yeah, japanese would be fun
[23:45:08] <zicada> but its much harder obv for a Germanic based speaker
[23:45:08] <zicada> sure
[23:45:08] <zicada> i mean i see what you mean
[23:45:08] <zicada> but the goal is languages i guess
[23:45:21] <zicada> and picking ones that teach me the most about them
[23:46:11] <zicada> but it matters how far away from my root they are, Latin seems like a good starting point. Just from English I'm abale to understand a fair amt of Latin and Romanian, lots of similar words and roots
[23:48:00] <Parf> well if it's languages in general, i get that, and i see where you're going with it
[23:48:27] <zicada> my point about English is that English speakers maybe sometimes a bit too "protective" of their language. They often assume its what was spoken on those isles through history, that is false. They spoke old English and old Norse. Saxon is a form of old English/Norse. But then Richard came from Normandy and conqured, and after that, the nobody and everyone that mattered spoke French
[23:48:56] <zicada> thats why you have basic everyday farmer stuff mostly in germanic, and higher more noble stuff romance/latin based
[23:49:10] <zicada> and part of what makes English such a mess, because its pretty recent
[23:49:18] <zicada> relatively recent, say
[23:49:19] <Parf> that's almost more of a linguistics interest i'd say
[23:49:25] <zicada> absolutely
[23:49:29] <zicada> im a developer
[23:49:31] <Parf> well, fair enough
[23:49:46] <zicada> languages in programming and in linguistics and in culture have much in common
[23:49:50] <zicada> and its all pretty interesting imo
[23:50:04] <Parf> i went through a whole wittgenstein phase so i'm vaguely into linguistics and their general banishment for more promising systems
[23:50:33] <zicada> :)
[23:50:52] <Parf> so what do you develop?

[23:52:44] <zicada> its mostly architecting structure and moving and manipulating data
[23:53:00] <Parf> hm
[23:53:32] <zicada> and sometimes making interfaces, not my favorite, we have designers for that usually
[23:53:39] <Parf> sounds cool, but i'm at a loss for programming, strangely. it's the one field i doubt i'll ever dip my toes into proper
[23:54:12] <zicada> im relatively proud of the company itself though, unlike most companies we share a lot of our code, and we host a bunch of wikileaks mirrors
[23:55:39] <Parf> opensource is always a good ethical choice, unless you're designing like, something evil like malware or something
[23:55:56] <zicada> Its fun, it takes a fair amt of focus, more so than an "average" dayjob, but your job is your hobby etc
[23:56:03] <Parf> i'm still mad that "openai" hasn't released dall-e though, fuckers
[23:56:16] <zicada> yeah for sure
[23:56:34] <zicada> in the community everyone gets why you wouldnt share the details of an algorithm
[23:56:39] <zicada> but there are nice and less nice ways of doing that
[23:56:40] <spruit11> Dutch cheeses are good but the most well known is Gouda which is more of a mass consumption cheese.  Not a lot of variety to an outsider,  the more luxury cheeses range between very old a bit stinky,  young and soft - something close to an emmentaler,   and a variety with additional herbs or spices.
[23:56:45] <Parf> i feel like most programming is setting up a sort of model airplane and then leaving it in the window ignored and dusty for years until someone else sees it and is like "oh shit is that an f-35? dope!"
[23:56:58] <spruit11> It's almost all cow though.
[23:57:27] <zicada> Parf: generally whats popular on the web lately is trying to compleltely separate the airplane fuselage from the functionality
[23:57:45] <Parf> are you speaking metaphorically still?
[23:57:47] <zicada> that way you can have a common backend API that anything can talk to, a future APP or some other site
[23:58:05] <zicada> separating concerns
[23:58:11] <Parf> yeah i actually got access to the OpenAI api thingy the other day but i don't know what the hell to do with it
[23:58:34] <zicada> cool
[23:58:53] <zicada> what language do you prefer to use when playing with something like openai ?
[23:58:59] <Parf> english
[23:59:05] <zicada> hehe

[23:59:10] <Parf> i'm serious
[23:59:23] <zicada> in my experience its generally a python camp and a js camp
[23:59:24] <Parf> when messing with these newer ml systems you can just talk to it
[23:59:41] <Parf> i've been actually making a lot of art lately with this thing that's sorta based on openai's dall-e
[23:59:42] <zicada> both are great
[23:59:59] <Parf> but yeah, i'd like to learn python for the purposes of fucking around with some of these pytorch systems or whatever
