[00:34:03] <Grinnz> 1. there's no prototype in that sub, 2. you don't want a prototype anyway, so that's good, 3. yes the arrayref will be the first arg
[00:34:28] <rewt> your @array contains a single arrayref, which itself contains 2 elements
[00:34:34] <Grinnz> if you were using prototype as a generic term, that's fine, but it's an actual feature (you don't usually want to use it though)
[00:35:08] <Grinnz> right,t he problem is you created your array wrong
[00:35:31] <WantToHelp> appreciate the help guys, how should i create it
[00:35:37] <Grinnz> my @array = (1,1);
[00:35:44] <Grinnz> or my $arrayref = [1,1];
[00:35:51] <Grinnz> [] returns a ref
[00:36:09] <WantToHelp> oh so right now i have a reference inside a reference
[00:36:19] <WantToHelp> when i pass it to the function
[00:36:20] <Grinnz> and the parentheses there are only for precedence - you can assign a single element to an array (like a ref) without parentheses
[00:36:23] <Grinnz> right

[00:54:41] <gamo> What's your opinion on perl -c and Perl::Critic? I think they could be more strict to warn you about possible glitches.
[00:55:50] <Grinnz> not everyone will agree, but you can customize your perlcritic set or write new policies if you want
[00:56:19] <gamo> thanks Grinnz, perfect response.
[00:56:50] <Grinnz> most of the problems we see people run into are encapsulated in Perl::Critic::Community
[00:57:10] <Grinnz> there are also several core perlcritic policies that are actively harmful to follow
[00:57:21] <Grinnz> so, "more strict" isn't always good

[08:22:34] <genio> Grinnz: I remember you toying with FFI in the past. Do I remember correctly that you found it to be too slow for what you were working on?
[08:23:26] <Grinnz> only when i had to unpack a complex self-referential struct to a perl structure
[08:23:41] <Grinnz> XS code is capable of doing that much faster
[08:23:56] <Grinnz> this was for hiredis, and it was a bottleneck for the parser
[08:24:05] <genio> ok, so far I don't think I'm going to hit that at all with libsodium. FFI should work fine
[08:25:15] <Grinnz> (self referential because you can't just have a variable element array in C, so it's basically a one-way linked list)
[08:27:06] <genio> I'm still on the inconsequential bits of libsodium: https://github.com/genio/sodium-ffi/ there are just so many functions to implement and they're all only implemented in version X and above.
[08:27:06] <Paperbot_> Link title(s): [ GitHub - genio/sodium-ffi: FFI implementation of libsodium ]
[08:29:33] <genio> I have the XS version to fix as well, but that has so many issues past a specific version of the libsodium library that it's almost useless. I kind of want to get this working as my test-bed for that

[14:45:18] <daemon> treebuilder for reading stuff, but what about editing the other more complex document?
[14:45:28] <daemon> this is within mojolicous so ... Mojo::DOM ? or something else
[14:45:48] <daemon> effectively the right hand side xml (the one being modified) is a template that needs bits and bobs adding to it

[14:57:15] <daemon> the one thing I would warn is that these are non sane inputs 
[14:57:25] <daemon> that is the data in the lefthandside is some proprietary pos XML
[14:57:32] <daemon> what it maps to on the side is different to the left
[14:58:45] <daemon> for instance, the left hand side might have <blah><child>something</child></blah> and that might map to .... <DOC  ...><attribute><child><child> and <DOC ...><pragma><child> ....

[14:59:33] <daemon> literally this webserver is literally a conversion matrix
[14:59:38] <daemon> double literally
[14:59:43] <daemon> yikes *slaps self*
[15:00:12] <daemon> even though I am kind of used to reading XML I have very/never had to write it before
[15:03:25] <daemon> would xslt be correct for this type of thing
[15:08:27] <rindolf> daemon: i think so, maybe unless you need to break  a text node into parts
[15:09:12] <daemon> ah nothing like that nope
[15:09:21] <daemon> the only weirdness is there are some 'if' conditions
[15:09:27] <daemon> if this is ... something then do ....
[15:12:01] <daemon> rindolf, would it be possible to ask you about some simple xslt examples simple 1:1 type things a little later on

[23:39:24] <daemon> if I had some xml in a $scalar, that contained no newlines, so one huge line - is there anything I can use to pretty print it
[23:41:01] <Grinnz> xmllint is included in libxml
[23:41:08] <daemon> XML::Tidy looks legit as well
[23:41:12] <daemon> ill give both a spin
[23:41:45] <Grinnz> if you have to use a perl module yeah, but i would prefer xmllint as it's more likely to be maintained
[23:42:38] <daemon> I kind of don't care as long as it works, really the XML is newline less, but for debugging purposes because of editing it (via mojo::DOM) it would be nice if it could output something pretty I can look at (for the moment)
[23:42:42] <daemon> it will be stripped out later :)
[23:43:21] <Grinnz> another thing to keep in mind is that pretty-printing XML is actually a modification to the XML, because whitespace is part of the XML nodes
[23:43:30] <Grinnz> so for instance Mojo::DOM will preserve it
[23:43:37] <daemon> all the nodes in this are <nospace>
[23:43:52] <Grinnz> don't know what that means
[23:43:59] <daemon> there are no spaces in the nodes them self
[23:44:03] <daemon> or do you mean between the child nodes
[23:44:40] <Grinnz> i mean, <foo>\n</foo> has a child node that contains the string "\n", <foo></foo>\n is followed by a node that contains the string "\n"
[23:44:55] <Grinnz> whitespace is represented in XML as data
[23:45:14] <daemon> ah right, yeah that is cool there is no data like that in this lot, and even if they was the xml being used is not the same as being displayed
[23:45:33] <daemon> I really just want to make sure I am appending the correct elements in the right place
[23:45:51] <Grinnz> yeah, usually doesn't matter just something to keep in mind

[23:46:33] <Grinnz> it's real easy when writing xml manually to end up with strings that look like "\nfoo\n\t\t" accidentally
[23:48:30] *** Joins: andrzejku (~andrzejku@45-11-60-125.ip4.greenlan.pl)
[23:48:34] <daemon> I bet :)
[23:48:56] <daemon> is \t the standard for xml, \s{4}
[23:49:05] <daemon> not \s{4} *
[23:49:19] <daemon> do not see real tab much now days
[23:49:26] <Grinnz> there isn't a standard for xml
[23:49:37] <daemon> ah its whatever you like ok dokey
[23:49:46] <Grinnz> mostly, it was easier to write in the example :P
[23:50:03] <daemon> :)
[23:50:34] <daemon> I am receiving some simplistic XML and basically putting it into effectively a template larger xml documents, apparently going to have to sue something called XSLT
[23:50:36] <daemon> that will be fun
[23:50:40] <daemon> use*

[23:57:33] <troydm> how do I get an array reference from a split function call without explicitly creating a separate @array and putting result into it and then getting reference from it?
