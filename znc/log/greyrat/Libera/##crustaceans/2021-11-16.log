[00:55:42] <Church> Sec
[00:56:20] <Church> So filed a missing persons report
[00:56:28] <Church> He's been gone with his car for a week
[00:56:34] <Church> Either dead or awaiting deportation
[00:56:46] <Church> I mean it's not verified, but I don't think he drove with insurance, license or his plates. And he also worked here on a student visa while not also going to school if I understood and heard right.
[00:57:12] <Church> So if caught... not looking great to commit multiple felonies on a visa while violating the visa
[01:03:59] <drakonis> oh, damn.
[01:05:05] <imode> why do you think he's committed a crime?
[01:09:49] <ngoldbaum> driving without a license or insurance or registration
[01:11:18] <Xe> or plates
[01:12:54] <ngoldbaum> tbh i see lots of cars driving without plates lately
[01:13:19] <ngoldbaum> or expired out of state paper temp tags
[01:13:29] <Xe> you only need to have the back plate iirc
[01:19:36] <Church> And by lack of plates I think he used someone else's plates
[01:19:39] <Church> Which is worse iirc
[01:22:30] <manicennui> Xe: Depends on the state.
[01:23:41] <manicennui> Church: Unless you want that other person to be investigated for your crimes.

[01:24:30] <buttsbot> 'Antiwork' movement may be long-run risk to labor force participation: Goldman Sachs
[01:24:31] <manicennui> Oh no!
[01:25:02] <manicennui> The bank’s economics team pointed to the reddit thread r/Antiwork, a social media community carrying the mantra “Unemployment for all, not just the rich!”
[01:25:40] <manicennui> The subreddit is about a tenth the size of the WallStreetBets thread of GameStop mania fame, but Goldman points out that Antiwork now ranks above WallStreetBets in comments per day.
[01:25:47] <manicennui> Wow. They really looked into this reddit thing.
[01:26:40] <companion_cube> they're quite nice, giving the subreddit so much publicity
[01:30:06] <hoistbypetard> i mean, that's the kind of super genius thinking that usually happens when someone really looks into the reddit thing. seems legit.
[01:31:32] <hoistbypetard> Brekkjern: You made me think of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Asked_for_It (my memory is the 80s iteration of the show)
[01:31:32] <buttsbot> You Asked for It - Wikipedia
[01:31:58] <Brekkjern> Never heard of it tbh
[01:32:24] <drakonis> lmao
[01:32:47] <hoistbypetard> the only relevant part is saying "You Asked For It" then zapping someone with whatever it is :)
[01:32:57] <hoistbypetard> like you did with that reddit thread here
[01:33:13] <manicennui> Goldman Sachs points out that it is unclear if these “worker’s preferences and lifestyles” — likely aided by the tilt in labor force dynamics in favor of workers — will last forever.
[01:33:14] <manicennui> hah
[01:33:38] <manicennui> Workers and their not wanting to be treated like slaves lifestyles!
[01:34:06] <hoistbypetard> it *is* unclear how long workers will be able to swing that bat and get anything for it
[01:40:40] <manicennui> They better get to making NFTs and trading meme stocks.
[01:40:48] <ngoldbaum> don’t student loans need to start getting paid back again in like a month or two?
[01:41:24] <hoistbypetard> Trolling is a art.
[01:41:56] <manicennui> Other than screwing up their credit, is there any real consequences to not paying student loans?
[01:42:08] <manicennui> s/is/are/
[01:42:48] <hoistbypetard> "other than screwing up their credit"?
[01:43:15] <hoistbypetard> that limits their ability to participate in (and consequently help grow) the economy
[01:43:18] <manicennui> I'm guessing that many of them have bad credit anyways, and many people manage to get by without good credit.
[01:43:21] <manicennui> Somehow my brother does it.
[01:43:47] <manicennui> At some point it has to be worth having bad credit to avoid paying something you can't afford and gives you no other ongoing benefit.
[01:44:10] <hoistbypetard> having fewer people able to participate fully in the economy is a net negative for society
[01:44:11] <dminkovsky> firefox restarted https://i.imgur.com/EzCiwK6.png
[01:44:37] <manicennui> hoistbypetard: That seems like an argument for forgiving a huge chunk of the loans.
[01:44:40] <hoistbypetard> or did you just mean consequences for the person not paying their loan?
[01:44:41] <dminkovsky> defaulting on your student debt fucks your life
[01:44:45] <manicennui> hoistbypetard: Yes.
[01:45:00] <manicennui> Like if your payments are $500 per month, but that means you can't survive...
[01:45:12] <dminkovsky> before FF restarted my life was not in color
[01:45:17] <dminkovsky> now, no problem
[01:45:21] <dminkovsky> 32-bit baby
[01:45:31] <manicennui> dminkovsky: Was it like that scene in the Wizard of Oz?
[01:45:36] <dminkovsky> exactly
[01:45:43] <dminkovsky> before it was like schlinders list
[01:45:49] <dminkovsky> now firefox is that rose
[01:46:02] <manicennui> How does defaulting on student debt fuck your life beyond typical credit problems?
[01:46:05] * hoistbypetard thinks a lot of the loans should be forgiven, or at least have repayment terms changed
[01:46:22] <dminkovsky> i don't tihnk you can re-negotiate student debt in that same way. it's a different class of debt
[01:46:44] <dminkovsky> i may be wrong
[01:46:59] <manicennui> You can certainly take another loan and pay off the others, assume you can somehow qualify.
[01:47:00] <dminkovsky> and in general, having credit problems fucks your life
[01:47:07] <dminkovsky> imagine if you had credit problems manicennui
[01:47:09] <dminkovsky> you'd be fucked
[01:47:24] <manicennui> Not being able to eat or being homeless is pretty hard too.
[01:47:31] <dminkovsky> yep
[01:47:40] <dminkovsky> but you can't have a house if you're creditless
[01:47:47] <dminkovsky> you're fucked either way
[01:47:57] <dminkovsky> you can't get a house, an apartment, a car, nothing
[01:48:03] <manicennui> dminkovsky: I know people who have serious credit problems. Their lives are certainly hard, but I'm talking about situations where the options are paying the debt or surviving.
[01:48:09] <manicennui> You can get apartments.
[01:48:18] <dminkovsky> not anywhere iv'e lived
[01:48:29] <dminkovsky> maybe in new york you can get public housing
[01:48:33] <manicennui> My brother gets evicted like every year and somehow finds new places.
[01:48:43] <dminkovsky> as i recall, his life is a mess
[01:49:05] <manicennui> My father also had bad credit for a couple decades and always had a place to live and a car.
[01:49:19] <manicennui> Sure.
[01:49:22] <dminkovsky> a palce to live doesn't mean a decent place to live
[01:49:31] <dminkovsky> living in a bad place often sets you up for more failure
[01:49:32] <manicennui> My father wasn't living in dumps.
[01:49:37] <dminkovsky> interesting
[01:49:39] <manicennui> There was nothing wrong with the places he lived.
[01:49:46] <dminkovsky> who rents to people w/o credit in 2020
[01:49:48] <manicennui> He had friends and such that had rentals.
[01:49:51] <manicennui> There are ways.
[01:49:59] <dminkovsky> it's harder anyway
[01:50:03] <dminkovsky> i'm sure you agree lol
[01:50:05] <manicennui> Absolutely.
[01:50:18] <dminkovsky> i mean ig uess you were saying it's not homelessness
[01:50:23] <dminkovsky> i guess not
[01:50:32] <manicennui> I'm not saying stop paying just to stop paying.
[01:51:24] <manicennui> And frankly, if you owe like $50k for some worthless degree from a shitty private school that lied to you, I don't know that it is worth paying if you can't afford it.
[01:52:42] <manicennui> There must be a point where it makes sense to just not pay.
[01:53:38] <manicennui> And if it is a government backed loan, it isn't outside the realm of possibility that some politician will eventually manage to push through forgiveness.

[03:22:22] <dminkovsky> all day evry day i yell at clouds
[03:25:01] <dminkovsky> the grift has always been strong but at least people weren't like
[03:25:10] <dminkovsky> interaction automatons
[03:25:33] <dminkovsky> marketing has really started treating us as more sub-human than ever
[03:26:05] <prussian> It's beautiful
[03:26:52] <dminkovsky> i don't know... it's hard for me to find meaning as an interaction automaton
[03:28:32] <manicennui> dminkovsky: I don't know, marketing has always been pretty bad.
[03:28:49] <dminkovsky> manicennui: no
[03:28:51] <manicennui> At least from the time that they realized that they could use our psychology against us.
[03:29:07] <dminkovsky> 100 years ago marketing used to just state the value propsotion literally, clearly, in plain langauge
[03:29:11] <manicennui> And they used to be able to sell far more dangerous products.
[03:29:16] <dminkovsky> okay if you want to qualify it like that
[03:29:18] <manicennui> No it didn't.
[03:29:20] <dminkovsky> then yes
[03:29:25] <dminkovsky> okay, fine, how about 130 years ago
[03:29:29] <dminkovsky> 150 years ago?
[03:29:31] <dminkovsky> for sure.
[03:29:37] <prussian> Everything was always bad, no?
[03:29:58] <prussian> I imagine the only plus is it was harder to throw a service angle to everything I guess.
[03:30:04] <dminkovsky> it became all like "imagine yourself in a mercury" only at the turn of century
[03:30:06] <prussian> Back in the old days
[03:30:15] <manicennui> I think you have a delusional view of the past.
[03:30:20] <dminkovsky> i do not
[03:30:21] <manicennui> Things were good in the "good ole days".
[03:30:23] <manicennui> weren't
[03:30:36] <dminkovsky> advertising used to literally state the value proposition in plain language
[03:30:43] <dminkovsky> until the telegraph really got going
[03:30:47] <gerikson> "also were hiring ... a lot"
[03:30:48] <dminkovsky> and newspapers took off as a result
[03:31:05] <dminkovsky> i can show you plenty of examples
[03:31:28] <prussian> gerikson: I was planning on sending them an email saying I can be chief morale officer.
[03:31:41] <prussian> Just to see if they would get back to me. They say make up a job.
[03:34:31] <manicennui> dminkovsky: Snake oil and just plain bullshit was rampant.
[03:36:53] <dminkovsky> right, but that's not what i was talking about
[03:37:08] <dminkovsky> i said "advertising used to literally state the value proposition in plain language"
[03:37:13] <dminkovsky> https://i.imgur.com/Ntzm1xB.png
[03:37:47] <dminkovsky> And not until the end of the nineteenth century did advertising move fully into its modern mode of discourse. As late as 1890, advertising, still understood to consist of words, was regarded as an essentially serious and rational enterprise whose purpose was to convey information and make claims in propositional form. Advertising was, as Stephen Douglas said in another context, intended to appeal
[03:37:53] <dminkovsky> to understanding, not to passions.
[03:38:13] <dminkovsky> i didn't saying people didn't see you fake rheumatism drugs and all kinds of garbage. that's just people as old as time
[03:38:23] <dminkovsky> i'm saying the methods of pursuasion were completely different
[03:38:38] <dminkovsky> they way people concieved of themselves and others was completely different
[03:38:49] <dminkovsky> if i wanted to advertise to you, i concieved of you as a thinking, rational being
[03:39:02] <dminkovsky> not an interation id-automaton
[03:39:37] <dminkovsky> "“By the turn of the century, advertisers no longer assumed rationality on the part of their potential customers. Advertising became one part depth psychology, one part aesthetic theory. Reason had to move itself to other arenas.”
[03:39:43] <manicennui> It just hasn't been true in our lifetimes though.
[03:39:51] <manicennui> It has been this way probably since radio took off.
[03:39:51] <dminkovsky> correct
[03:39:56] <dminkovsky> the telegraph
[03:40:26] <manicennui> And television exacerbated it.
[03:40:28] <dminkovsky> the telegraph exploded newspapers because it gave newspapers content; and the explosion of newspapers created an explosion in advertising
[03:40:31] <dminkovsky> and transformed it
[03:40:53] <manicennui> That page we were discussing is mostly straightforward, it is just unlikely to be a good service.
[03:41:13] <dminkovsky> that's a good a point, yes
[03:41:32] <dminkovsky> i was just triggered by "how gen-z _interacts_ with money"

[09:36:02] <dminkovsky> RDF is not even dead, i was looking at an updated standard just a few years ago

[14:27:05] <pja> He’s not wrong tho.
[14:27:49] <pja> Python seems to have gone for the “sod it, we’ll just ship dev into prod” approach to softeng.
[14:27:52] <pja> Which makes anyone who
[14:28:09] <pja> ... ’s job it is to support that 7 layers of hell.
[14:28:44] <pja> only yesterday I discovered yet another python packager I was now supposed to use to get a program I wanted to work.
[14:28:50] <pja> (pipx this time...)
[14:30:38] <pja> Honestly though, I think the distros should just declare packaging bankruptcy with all these rapid development languages & stop supporting them.
[14:31:17] <pja> Maybe provide a path for the language library people themselves to provide packaged versions of their libraries instead?
[14:31:50] <pja> It feels like the current situation is a worst possible world one, where everyone is on their own seperate hamster wheels of meaningless dev scutwork & no one is happy.
[15:30:55] <gerikson> pja: yeah, as rants go it was on the mild side
[15:31:05] <gerikson> and justified
[15:31:46] <pja> It just seems to be the modern way :(
[15:31:54] <pja> npm is just as bad, if not worse in fact.
[15:32:22] <pja> Even Rust appears to have decided that a thundering herd of library developers hiding UnsafeIO inside their libraries is just fine.
[15:32:22] <buttsbot> 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏 developers 👏
[15:33:24] <pja> C++ & C just said: “sod it, you’re on your own” which was at least honest.
[15:34:10] <pja> & led to distro library support being better than anything else you were likely to get.

[17:59:08] <gwozniak> companion_cube: I think discourse is pretty nice. I mean plain mailing lists.  Using mail as part of the interface is fine.  It being the only interface to basically everything (including bug reports and code reviews) is a different matter
[17:59:44] <companion_cube> oh that, I agree

[18:08:08] <gwozniak> So a big name customer went up the chain and complained because "the compiler breaks our code"
[18:08:15] <gwozniak> And the code size is too big
[18:08:24] <gwozniak> But they refuse to turn on optimizations
[18:09:12] <gwozniak> I mean, I'm 99.9999% sure it's their code that's the problem, but "it's a secret" so they won't show us
[18:09:49] <gwozniak> When turning on optimizations breaks your app, the chances are very good your app is the problem, not the compiler
[18:09:52] <gwozniak> But anyway...
[18:13:57] <ngoldbaum> that’s why they pay you the big loonies
[18:14:00] <pja> gwozniak: Many years ago we shipped a custom parser that took a customer’s code & replaced all the indentifiers with anonymous ones (start at a, b ... aa, ab... etc)
[18:14:22] <pja> so they could send us a copy of their source without the incriminating variable names.
[18:14:43] <gwozniak> hahah
[18:15:32] <gwozniak> The funny thing is that they complain about code size, yet refuse to use any tool that is required to actually get smaller code
[18:16:27] <gwozniak> How much inline asm are you using? Do you understand volatile? Etc.
[18:16:37] <gwozniak> Can't get answers to those questions, apparently
[18:16:57] <pja> Is it C? C++? Something else?
[18:17:27] <pja> But yeah, if you’re compiling C & the optimiser breaks your code then you’re probably doing something you shouldn’t.
[18:18:04] <pja> That said, reading the war stories of static code analyser vendors has cured me of any idea that programmers actually understand the languages they use.
[18:18:38] <pja> The “we are a definitely allowed to write to the word just before an allocation” one was a particular favourite.
[18:19:32] <pja> (Or maybe it was off the end, I forget — it was one or the other.)
[18:21:41] <Brekkjern> Honestly, I don't think it really is possible to understand what we are doing. There will always be some abstraction below that works differently than you expect.
[18:22:48] <gwozniak> pja: it's C
[18:23:51] <pja> I do have a certain amount of sympathy for old school C programmers faced with modern compiler engineers deciding that “undefined behaviour means I get to f.ck with your code, regardless of intent”
[18:24:33] <gwozniak> Most common problems for our customers: misuse of inline asm, misuse of volatile, not understanding floating point
[18:25:07] <pja> forgetting a clobber in inline asm is very common.
[18:26:01] <pja> volatile doesn’t do what you expect & no one reads “what every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmentic”

[18:26:21] <companion_cube> isn't volatile juste supposed to be used for memory-mapped IO or things like that?

[18:26:23] <buttsbot> Letting users tick (select) a ‘none’ checkbox | Hacker News
[18:26:27] <companion_cube> for embedded people it seems like it'd make sense
[18:29:59] <gwozniak> Yeah, volatile is generally only something you want on memory-mapped I/O.  It is used a lot in embedded, but it gets overused
[18:30:35] <gerikson> Drew is on a roll https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29240952
[18:30:36] <buttsbot> I will pay you cash to delete your NPM module | Hacker News
[18:30:55] <gwozniak> Also, alignment issues show up sometimes.  People used __attribute__((packed)) aiming to save space, but sometimes it means things get accessed incorrectly by the hardware
[18:31:19] <companion_cube> gwozniak: I was about to post that
[18:31:37] <companion_cube> I love how he says "we" to speak on behalf of all the distros
[18:31:53] <gwozniak> Stack corruption is another thing: maybe you didn't allocate enough for it
[18:32:41] <pja> companion_cube: Some people think you should use it for shared variables in a threaded program. These people are wrong.
[18:33:05] <gwozniak> The thing is that lots of these issues don't show up right away
[18:33:22] <pja> I mean, you can if you want, but volatile won’t protect you aginst torn reads/writes, nor does it preserve ordering relations.
[18:33:35] <pja> You need a proper mutex in that case.
[18:33:55] <ngoldbaum> feels like what drew is suggesting there is at least crime-adjacent?
[18:34:03] <companion_cube> pja: ah yes, that's java's "volatile" I think
[18:34:06] <companion_cube> and even then
[18:34:19] <gwozniak> Customers will throw volatile on every variable used (even local) just so the compiler will generate the code in a way they think it should be written (as in, no code hoisting or anything like that)
[18:34:40] <gerikson> ngoldbaum: pretty sure he can get sued for damages from people depending on the packages
[18:34:54] <gerikson> feels that way anyway
[18:35:11] <ngoldbaum> yeah i’m not sure i doubt drew gives a fuck
[18:35:17] <gerikson> the module author is probably off the hoook (NO WARRANTY)
[18:36:43] <pja> gerikson: Not sure? If the module maintainer has a business relationship with any of the users, then it’s obviously tortious interference, but in the pure OSS, no contract case that’s not going to fly?

[18:38:16] <ngoldbaum> yeah, the main issue is paying people to cause a bunch of disruption with the goal of causing disruption

[18:39:09] <gerikson> ``A condition of this is that you must delete it without notice, so that everyone who depends on it wakes up to a broken build.''
[18:40:12] <gerikson> it feels a bit hinky to me... everyone "knows" NPM is a liability but it's a huge collective action problem
[18:40:32] <gerikson> best thing would be for a big player to "take responsibility" for a core "standard library"
[18:41:28] <Brekkjern> Isn't the idea of the small modules that you shouldn't be downloading large libraries because of one function?
[18:41:32] <edk> right, but that's not going to happen, and to be honest i respect that ddv is trying to do something rather than sitting around identifying it as a collective action problem while lamenting the fact that nobody is doing anything about it
[18:42:58] <companion_cube> what is he doing except lamenting?
[18:43:14] <dminkovsky> drew can't help but alienate and put off while also being right
[18:43:22] <companion_cube> it's definitely a leadership problem, I agree at least with that, though
[18:43:22] <edk> companion_cube: offering people money to delete their modules

[18:44:15] <dminkovsky> nothing but a basic attention whore, plain and simple
[18:44:28] <companion_cube> ah I didn't see, edk
[18:45:05] <dminkovsky> what can be done about it, first of all, is having the equivalent of docker automated builds set up on NPM, so that your modules are what you see on github
[18:45:26] <dminkovsky> burn and destroy isn't a real solution, it's just attention seeking
[18:45:31] <edk> then do that
[18:45:37] <dminkovsky> microsoft has to do that
[18:45:41] <companion_cube> maybe the PSF should indeed recognize the problem and make poetry official, or sth
[18:45:42] <edk> microsoft isn't doing that
[18:45:50] <dminkovsky> right, it sucks
[18:45:58] <dminkovsky> deleteing `is-array` is not the answer
[18:46:04] <edk> this is exactly the sort of shit that makes me think ddv is okay, actually

[18:49:49] <dminkovsky> " no one is going to respond favorably to that kind of behavior" -- well, except people who seek abuse, which is the primary thing that he contributes to humanity

[18:50:13] <gerikson> :D
[18:50:25] <Brekkjern> dminkovsky: Well, the point was that the cause of that incident has been adressed and it is now not possible for it to happen anymore.
[18:50:41] <dminkovsky> Brekkjern: it has?
[18:51:08] <ngoldbaum> dminkovsky: the npm link i shared a few minutes ago explains
[18:51:42] <ngoldbaum> it’s no longer possible to unpublish packages that have other packages depending on them and are older than 72 hours old
[18:56:57] <Brekkjern> Hmm. Maybe I should learn Nim?

[18:58:58] <dminkovsky> lol i missed that it's satire
[18:59:09] <dminkovsky> "satire"
[18:59:09] <dminkovsky> wtf
[18:59:41] <dminkovsky> was that "satire" note there or was it added
[18:59:59] <gerikson> I tink it was there all the time but the whitespace "hid" it
[19:00:01] <gerikson> bbl
[19:00:13] <dminkovsky> I do hope that this idea strikes fear in the hearts of any Node developers that read it, and in other programming language communities which have taken after npm.

[20:33:00] <manicennui> That would be a pretty cool post apocalyptic movie actually.
[20:33:06] <manicennui> I guess that is what Waterworld was.
[20:33:27] <manicennui> Waterworld remake?!
[20:33:45] <manicennui> With a Kevin Costner cameo.
[20:40:40] <gwozniak> I didn't hate Waterworld (I saw it when it came out).  I got entertainment from it and that's what mattered
[20:40:50] <gwozniak> But man, what a cursed production it was
[21:02:19] <manicennui> Yeah, I don't understand all of the hate for it.
[21:02:38] <manicennui> I also don't know why most people focus so much on the financials of movies.
[21:02:51] <manicennui> I don't care whether the studio makes money.
[21:03:38] <manicennui> The film's release was accompanied by a novelization, video game, and four themed attractions at Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal Studios Singapore, Universal Studios Japan, and Universal Studios Beijing called Waterworld: A Live Sea War Spectacular, all of which are still running as of 2021.

[21:19:25] <manicennui> I slept poorly the previous week or two.

[21:41:11] <jjuran> What does isArray("[object Array]") return
[21:41:40] <dminkovsky> false i hope
[21:42:09] <dminkovsky> the sad thing about isArray is that Array.isArray is a method as of es6 at least
[21:42:25] <dminkovsky> and is "polyfilled" if you can call it that by babel
[21:44:04] <dminkovsky> those early nodejs days really attracted a lot of idealistic people
[21:45:01] <dminkovsky> i remember arguing with substack on freenode #nodejs about whther IDEs were evil or not
[21:45:31] <dminkovsky> hmm /whois substack suggests he might be here on libera, too
[21:46:18] <jjuran> Right, it uses Array.isArray if present, but if not…
[21:46:29] <dminkovsky> jjuran: :)
[21:47:15] <dminkovsky> well depending on how you configure babel, it puts that method onto there w/o downloading `is-array` from npm :)
[21:47:33] <dminkovsky> i believe babel-polyfill is long-deprecated, but that's the idea one way or another
[21:47:57] <dminkovsky> babel-env and all the stuff it depends on is a work of art

[23:02:15] <manicennui> Spite stores might be one of the best concepts I've ever seen in a sitcom. I think about that sort of thing all the time.
[23:05:29] <manicennui> He got Jonah Hill to do a spite diner, Sean Penn to do a spite bird store, and Mila Kunis to do a spite jewelry store.
[23:06:38] <dminkovsky> discriminated unions in typescript and the new branching features added around them in 4.5 basically let you implement dependent types if you want
[23:06:49] <imode> define "spite" store.
[23:06:51] <manicennui> I don't want to use TS though.
[23:07:07] <dminkovsky> that's its own thing
[23:07:10] <manicennui> imode: Store wrongs you, so you use your wealth to open a competing store next door.
[23:07:13] <dminkovsky> he opens a coffee shop
[23:07:15] <imode> hah.
[23:07:17] <dminkovsky> to piss off another coffee shop
[23:07:38] <dminkovsky> i only got half way through that season cause i was triggered by some shit in it and then stopped watchinf curb. the spite shop thing is good though
[23:07:49] <dminkovsky> let's argue about typescript

[23:08:12] <dminkovsky> :/
[23:08:25] <dminkovsky> i'm a typescript missionary, god get your mind out of the gutter
[23:08:36] <manicennui> Tacking a type system on to JS does not make it good.
[23:09:28] <dminkovsky> i just thouhgt it would be fun to make a type that was `number` excluding `0`
[23:09:33] <dminkovsky> so that i don't have to do runtime checks
[23:09:36] <dminkovsky> and realized i could lol
[23:09:38] <dminkovsky> i don't think i will
[23:09:41] <dminkovsky> cause jesus
[23:09:46] <dminkovsky> but it was amusing
[23:10:09] <imode> why not?
[23:10:19] <dminkovsky> i try to keep it idiomatic?
[23:10:27] <dminkovsky> also i have no experience with where that might lead
[23:10:31] <dminkovsky> and i don't feel like finding out now
[23:12:01] <manicennui> I think the language I want is a mix of the JVM ecosystem, the BEAM runtime, and Clojure's syntax.
[23:13:09] <companion_cube> a clojure-like on BEAM seems like a doable project, no?
[23:13:44] <imode> provided rich hickeys' uber structure can fit on it in a reasonable manner.
[23:14:31] <companion_cube> well, the BEAM has maps now
[23:14:45] <manicennui> companion_cube: Yes, but I want the JVM's ecosystem of libraries.
[23:14:47] <companion_cube> what else is needed? vectors maybe?
[23:14:56] <manicennui> I'm sure there are a few lisps for BEAM.
[23:14:57] <companion_cube> manicennui: just use RPC™ !!
[23:15:02] <companion_cube> there's at least LFE I think
[23:15:36] <manicennui> Yeah, there is another one that someone recommended over LFE...
[23:16:39] <imode> clojure uses some fusion between a bitwise trie and something else to achieve structural sharing and iirc all of its data structures are born out of that.

[23:20:47] <imode> yeehaw.

[23:21:20] <manicennui> With Java's new FFI, I wonder whether a bunch of libraries will move to C.

[23:21:23] <buttsbot> Persistent data structure - Wikipedia
[23:22:02] <companion_cube> imode: so is clojure's I think?
[23:22:05] <companion_cube> otherwise there is no point
[23:22:09] <companion_cube> you could just use a hashmap
[23:22:23] <imode> no no, _clojure_ requires that.
[23:22:39] <imode> clojure requires a PHAMT, iirc BEAM's isn't.
[23:22:58] <imode> I guess. weird that it's mentioned only in a single talk.
[23:23:15] <companion_cube> hu.
[23:23:21] <companion_cube> BEAM is almost entirely purely functional

[23:36:05] <imode> that has to be fuckin' fake.
[23:36:31] <jjuran> manicennui: What new Java FFI, and why would that prompt a move to C?
[23:36:59] <manicennui> https://openjdk.java.net/projects/panama/
[23:37:00] <buttsbot> OpenJDK: Panama
[23:37:10] <manicennui> Because geeks are fucking obsessed with low level bullshit.
[23:37:20] <imode> damn, tell us how you really feel.
[23:37:43] <manicennui> I hate geeks.
[23:37:56] <imode> you're among them.
[23:38:01] <manicennui> Sure.
[23:38:11] <manicennui> I hate that I'm part of a group of such people.
[23:38:12] <imode> define "low level bullshit".
[23:38:18] <companion_cube> using C
[23:38:21] <companion_cube> 🤭
[23:38:22] <companion_cube> (sorry)
[23:38:24] <imode> rust is low level bullshit.
[23:38:40] <manicennui> An obsession with needing to do things "low level" because of imagined concerns.
[23:38:46] <manicennui> imode: Agreed.
[23:38:58] <imode> hot take: someone needs to do it.
[23:38:58] <manicennui> Rust is great for things where C might have actually made sense.
[23:39:05] <manicennui> But in most cases, neither is the answer.
[23:39:15] <imode> define.. most cases?
[23:39:32] <manicennui> Most performance problems are not language problems.
[23:39:46] <manicennui> And most programmers have no business writing low level code.
[23:39:48] <imode> to build the towering beasts of abstraction that we have these days, you need to start _somewhere_.
[23:39:53] <imode> that's fair.
[23:39:58] <manicennui> imode: We already do.
[23:39:58] <imode> and also fair.
[23:40:05] <manicennui> Which language is not built on top of C and C libraries?
[23:40:25] <imode> the JVM isn't C, is it.
[23:40:31] <imode> is BEAM C..?
[23:40:33] <manicennui> C or C++.
[23:40:36] * imode thonk.
[23:40:38] <manicennui> Everything is.
[23:40:53] <imode> I would call it a stretch to say everything, this is excluding self-hosted languages.
[23:40:58] <imode> which iirc rust is.
[23:41:03] <manicennui> https://github.com/openjdk/jdk
[23:41:03] <buttsbot> GitHub - openjdk/jdk: JDK main-line development
[23:41:07] <manicennui> Looks like more C++ than C.
[23:41:33] <companion_cube> manicennui: yeah it's a continuum
[23:41:34] <imode> 2.4% assembly. huh, I expected more.
[23:41:35] <manicennui> imode: It is still going to link against C libraries, but that isn't really the point.
[23:41:43] <manicennui> Something at the level of C/C++/Rust.
[23:41:44] <companion_cube> some languages are built on top of a shitton of C and C libraries
[23:41:44] <imode> right, because you live on a system... written in C.
[23:41:47] <companion_cube> some use only a little
[23:42:22] <manicennui> When you actually *have* a performance problem, figure out where the bottleneck is.
[23:42:24] <companion_cube> the demarcation is whether the stdlib data structures are in C, I think
[23:42:31] <manicennui> Rewriting in a lower level language is rarely the answer.
[23:42:57] <imode> I've not seen someone advocate for rewriting things in C.
[23:43:49] <manicennui> You've not seen people advocate rewriting various things in Go/Rust?
[23:43:49] <edm> may have had sympathy with this a bit ago
[23:44:06] <edm> but rewriting a load of python simulation code in rust at work recently has been such a powerful drug
[23:44:18] <edm> it’s like a magic wand
[23:44:25] <imode> I wouldn't call Go "low level".
[23:44:43] <manicennui> Go is fucking terrible for business logic.
[23:44:54] <indigo> If GC is slowing down a piece of critical code, it might be useful to rewrite things in a language without GC. But maybe first see if there is a way to work with the GC
[23:44:55] <imode> not strictly, anyway. low level in that its unhindered concurrency fetish makes it hard to do.. anything.
[23:45:06] <imode> but that GC does pose an interesting barrier.

[23:45:09] <buttsbot> Twitter - sandofsky - Lambda School has renamed itself “BloomTech” and pivoted into student loans. The twist is a refund offer, with interesting fi...
[23:45:21] <ngoldbaum> ycombinator? more like yscambinator
[23:45:24] <imode> oh boy, I gotta check that out when I'm back.
[23:46:16] <jjuran> They could pivot into catering, as ynombinator
[23:46:29] <jjuran> Or into politics as ynominator
[23:46:56] <edm> surely yconbinator is low-hanging fruit for the general case here
[23:47:02] <manicennui> I think it's shopify that now offers to finance all of the purchases I make through their stores.
[23:47:15] <manicennui> Because I need to finance my candles/soap for a year.
[23:47:37] <manicennui> Might be square.

[23:48:14] <manicennui> Which makes sense, but shouldn't be enabled on stores selling small home items.
[23:48:22] <manicennui> Also so it on a coffee shop.

[23:51:59] <Church> Yeah saw that lambda school thing. Nuts
[23:53:31] <indigo> I wonder if someone can apply for the same 10 jobs over and over again :P
[23:54:01] <manicennui> You are in luck. My startup created 100 shell companies that you can apply to for $20 per month.
[23:54:09] <manicennui> We promise to never extend an offer.
[23:54:39] <manicennui> You know, I'm surprised that some YC company hasn't done this to scam unemployment.
[23:55:14] <ngoldbaum> indigo: you also need to make five commits a week
[23:55:28] <manicennui> Just use GPT-3.
[23:55:29] <ngoldbaum> or i guess github contributions so pr comments count
[23:55:41] <jjuran> "As long as you commit, it will always work"
[23:55:43] <ngoldbaum> “missed a space here”
[23:56:21] <ngoldbaum> i wonder if that’s why people make nitpicky style comments over and over and over everywhere they see an issue, they’re paid by PR comment
[23:56:54] <Brekkjern> More likely they are annoyed by that tiny issue and send in a correction for that thing
[23:56:55] <manicennui> Isn't there some GitHub hackathon that encourages that nonsense?
