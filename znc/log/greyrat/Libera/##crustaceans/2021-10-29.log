[02:53:19] <imode> tbh I kind of agree with the idea that importing a package to do something the shell does for you is a little messy.

[02:56:35] <indigo> I had a T410 back in the day
[02:56:59] <indigo> It was actually quite terrible. The graphics driver kept freezing the computer, I guess they were meant to be used with Linux instead of Windows
[02:57:09] <indigo> Or pull a jcs and use 'em with OpenBSD
[02:57:15] <imode> quadro or IGP?
[02:57:18] <indigo> IGP

[04:40:01] <imode> distance function is (abs(first - second) <= 2). you can "paint" with a certain height level and the program lowers or raises terrain around your "brush" such that that constraint is always followed.
[04:40:33] <imode> every tile there is within 2 height levels of its neighbors (including the diagonals).
[04:41:00] <indigo> Nice! Is this for a game?
[04:41:30] <imode> yeah! kinda. I was trying to work out how to generate procedural maps in the style of the old GB and GBA pokemon games.
[04:42:19] <imode> first you need to understand/build constraints for placing tiles of a certain height and type, and this was just a small SDL application to figure that out.

[04:46:28] <imode> with more than likely some fluid dynamics applied.
[04:49:13] <indigo> That... makes more sense than what I was doing
[04:49:44] <imode> notice how the "action" is all around some deformation/force on the vector field.
[04:50:11] <imode> black blobs move around and merge and their "border" is the gradient that influences the underlying vector field.

[05:13:48] <imode> allo dimadima. how was it?
[05:14:40] <dimadima> not bad. i can't run too much, my legs don't really support my body, but it's a while it didn't hurt
[05:14:46] <dimadima> miss the gym
[05:15:05] <dimadima> in the summer i had a membership to a most excellent pool facilitiy here, outdoors
[05:15:19] <dimadima> it's been a while*
[05:15:47] <imode> I try to go go for a 10-20 minute walk at least four times a day.
[05:15:48] <dimadima> s/but it's a while it didn't hurt/but it's been a while so it didn't hurt/
[05:15:52] <dimadima> !
[05:15:54] <dimadima> that's awesome
[05:16:27] <imode> easy when ya got a dog.
[05:16:35] <imode> I imagine you'll take walks when your kid can. :)
[05:16:35] <dimadima> i walked a ton last year and earlier this year but the last month or so it's been really sedentary
[05:16:41] <dimadima> my dog was my child
[05:16:45] <dimadima> yeah
[05:16:59] <dimadima> oh well i have one of those thing that you strap the kid onto you
[05:17:14] <dimadima> i'd walk him a ton
[05:17:16] <imode> aha.
[05:17:19] <imode> great workout.
[05:17:34] <dimadima> great walk, but not a workout i'd say
[05:17:43] <dimadima> i'm like a dog, i need exercise
[05:18:02] <imode> heh. I just like nature.
[05:18:14] <imode> it's not the activity, it's the things I see on the activity.
[05:18:33] <dimadima> i like nature and meditative brain resets
[05:18:46] <dimadima> what kind of stuff do you see
[05:18:59] <imode> trees, ducks, birds.
[05:19:15] <dimadima> so basically what i see :)
[05:19:29] <imode> yup! we live by a pond and a playground though.
[05:19:32] <dimadima> we've had the geese going by the last few weeks. less so now, but still saw a couple
[05:19:35] <dimadima> today
[05:19:38] <imode> oh lovely!
[05:19:52] <dimadima> yeah they honk quite nicely
[05:20:01] <imode> hjonk

[05:20:08] <dimadima> hjonk
[05:21:03] <dimadima> dog is sweet
[05:21:18] <dimadima> i'd love a dog but i'm afraid of having to take care of it
[05:21:23] <dimadima> like medically
[05:21:55] <imode> you should be. it's a large responsibility.
[05:22:33] <imode> my ol' girl is 14 years old now.
[05:22:50] <imode> their life expectancy isn't that long.
[05:23:40] <dimadima> aw man
[05:24:00] <dimadima> my wife in particular loves old dogs
[05:24:34] <dimadima> she's the kind of person who'd run an old dog sanctuary or something
[05:25:06] <imode> aww.. I wouldn't have the heart for that.
[05:25:12] <dimadima> me neither
[05:25:16] <imode> saying goodbye always takes a part of my soul away.
[05:25:21] <dimadima> i wouldn't think she would either, it's one of the weird things about her
[05:25:42] <dimadima> well yeah cause dogs are like your best friends
[05:25:46] <dimadima> it's insane
[05:25:49] <dimadima> i couldn't deal with it
[05:26:00] <dimadima> that's why i don't have a dog
[05:26:17] <dimadima> but it would be great
[05:26:21] <imode> once she goes I'll probably just get a bird or something.
[05:26:57] <dimadima> oh god
[05:27:00] <dimadima> birds
[05:27:01] <dimadima> lol
[05:27:23] <imode> my wife would LOVE one.
[05:27:41] <imode> just need to read up on their standards of care.
[05:27:51] <imode> it's either that or some kind of rodent/lagomorph.
[05:28:06] <dimadima> where i last lived in new york some neighbors has a bird. i always like having my windows open and i guess they did too so we always heard this bird. but for a while i couldn't figure out if it was a bird or people always having some kind of weird sex because this bird made weird sex sounds
[05:28:27] <imode> LMAO.
[05:28:30] <dimadima> it took me a few solid weeks to decide it was a bird
[05:28:48] <dimadima> i don't know i'd want a dog or a cat or both
[05:28:52] <dimadima> or multiple dogs and cats
[05:29:08] <imode> we have a dog and a cat. and uh, the cat is... fun.
[05:29:09] <dimadima> i had a friend in college who had a pet rat
[05:29:15] <imode> he's gotten cuddlier lately.
[05:29:19] <imode> oh do tell.
[05:29:21] <dimadima> awesome
[05:29:26] <imode> did he call him cheddar or somethin.
[05:29:30] <dimadima> nothing it was pretty strange
[05:29:32] <dimadima> i forgot its name
[05:29:39] <dimadima> but it was a chill rat
[05:29:44] <dimadima> it just hung out w/o a cage most of the time
[05:29:47] <imode> rats are good company.
[05:29:49] <dimadima> and i mean like most of th etime
[05:30:07] <dimadima> i kind of liked it, it was a cool animal
[05:30:20] <imode> iirc they shit like machine guns though.
[05:30:31] <dimadima> i don't remember it shitting a lot
[05:30:41] <dimadima> but it probably did
[05:31:56] <dimadima> now i'm trying to remember its name
[05:32:33] <dimadima> it died randomly one day
[05:32:43] <imode> awww..
[05:32:51] <imode> yeah aren't their lifespans super short.
[05:33:04] <imode> I couldn't stand that.
[05:33:11] <imode> I'm not desensitized to death yet.
[05:33:51] <dimadima> i mean i liked it but it was a rat
[05:34:25] <dimadima> i'm not desenitized to death but i try
[05:34:33] <dimadima> when i was 5 my dad somehow got a bunch of goldfish for me
[05:34:37] <imode> everything you see has some kind of brain.
[05:34:46] <dimadima> like for free somewhere. i overfed them and killed them and they all died
[05:34:55] <dimadima> erm that was redundant
[05:35:03] <imode> you killed 'em until they were dead?
[05:35:11] <dimadima> lol exactly
[05:35:16] <imode> hardcore.
[05:35:18] <dimadima> anyway he was like "welp i guess we have to throw them out"
[05:35:27] <dimadima> took them and pour them into the toilet
[05:35:29] <dimadima> and flushed it
[05:35:34] <dimadima> i was like AAAHHHHHHHHH
[05:35:41] <dimadima> cause i was 5 you know
[05:36:00] <imode> 'course.
[05:36:04] <imode> that'd haunt me.
[05:36:07] <dimadima> but i thought about it a lot
[05:36:13] <dimadima> and it had this strange calibrating effect
[05:36:15] <imode> "WUH BUH WUH HOW THEY DIE?!"
[05:36:24] <dimadima> like "oh this is how you're supposed to respond to fish dying"
[05:36:48] <dimadima> i thought about it... a lot
[05:37:05] <dimadima> well yeah they explained i overfed them
[05:37:12] <dimadima> which they also warned me not to do :)
[05:37:43] <dimadima> i wasn't even bummed about them dying iirc; more like how sad it looked when they were all floating
[05:37:47] <dimadima> and that it was my fault
[05:37:53] <imode> little kids are destructive bastards.
[05:38:10] <dimadima> and then the seeming callousness of just dumping them in the toilet and flushing like nothing happened
[05:38:18] <dimadima> i'm not sure i'd do that w/ my child
[05:38:46] <dimadima> it's not guaranteed that every kid would respond postively to that kind of thing
[05:39:32] <dimadima> my sister is a cold bitch. when she was 5 our neighbors had chickens they raised all summer. one day they slaughtered them all and when my sister saw they were gone, she was like "oh, did they kill them?"
[05:39:45] <dimadima> i mean she played with these chicks and then chickens all summer
[05:39:48] <dimadima> i would have cried
[05:39:55] <imode> same.
[05:40:39] <imode> poor chickens. why you gotta be good eatin'.
[05:42:34] <gwozniak> When I was about 10 or 11, I was in the car with my siblings. My mom was driving and us kids had been a bit of a pain so my mom wat not in a good mood
[05:43:02] <gwozniak> Anyway, she's pulling in the garage and our cat is there, who was unafraid of the car
[05:43:09] <imode> oh god..
[05:43:36] <gwozniak> My mom was pissed off and cursed about the cat, then drove in anyway
[05:43:50] <gwozniak> She ran over the cat and screamed at us to get inside without looking
[05:44:05] <gwozniak> We all did and were basically traumatized for a bit
[05:44:12] <imode> fuuuuck.
[05:44:23] <imode> who does something like that?!
[05:44:54] <gwozniak> Me being the oldest, I went out a little while later and my mom and our landlord's wife were hosing down the garage floor
[05:45:23] <gwozniak> The cat had since been removed, thankfully
[05:45:33] <imode> poor kitty.. :(
[05:45:45] <gwozniak> But a little later my mom explained what she saw when she had run it over
[05:45:49] <dimadima> kids will do that to you
[05:45:52] <gwozniak> That sticks with me
[05:46:17] <imode> compassion for life is apparently a rarity.
[05:46:18] <gwozniak> I'll spare everyone the details
[05:46:56] <gwozniak> I think about that event a lot, because my mom just didn't give a shit about the cat at the time
[05:47:12] <dimadima> < imode> compassion for life is apparently a rarity. | i'm guessing this was an accident
[05:47:23] <gwozniak> It kind of was
[05:47:37] <imode> she was aware of the cat and did it anyway.
[05:47:42] <gwozniak> I think she thought the cat would move
[05:47:54] <imode> hell naw it's a dumb animal.
[05:47:55] <dimadima> kid can drive you crazy
[05:48:13] <dimadima> my friend has this cat and i was messing with it
[05:48:17] <dimadima> and i had a watermelon
[05:48:21] <gwozniak> The scream from my mom was legit, though
[05:48:24] <dimadima> and i rolled the watermelon at the cat, thinking it would move
[05:48:28] <dimadima> --it did not move
[05:48:38] <imode> oh god.
[05:48:42] <dimadima> it looked at me soooo pisssed off
[05:48:44] <dimadima> i felt really bad
[05:48:50] <dimadima> i mean nothing happened to it
[05:48:54] <gwozniak> I mean, it's tragically funny in a way
[05:49:02] <dimadima> gwozniak: wow
[05:49:13] <dimadima> what an experience!
[05:49:27] <gwozniak> One of many from my childhood days :)
[05:50:17] <imode> we had a cat from like, 2010 up through 2018 or so.. calico cat, lovely but shy. my parents neglected her and overfed her and never took her to the vet, up until she was so overweight and pretty much ready to die that I sat with her for a solid 3 days.
[05:50:31] <imode> didn't want to drink or eat, but I made an effort.
[05:50:33] <gwozniak> :-(
[05:51:15] <gwozniak> My previous cat fell off our balcony and died. That was really sad. I did not like having to deal with that.
[05:51:15] <imode> she was drinking and then coughed up, meowed in a very low, droning meow, and then finally died. seeing the life leave something's eyes will break you.
[05:51:32] <gwozniak> oh dear
[05:51:33] <imode> I tried to do cat CPR and broke down in a heap after that.
[05:51:49] <imode> like you could see all of her memories just wash away.
[05:52:08] <gwozniak> Yeah
[05:52:29] <imode> it's not like "oh welp this thing is alright and is bouncing around and WHAM it's dead, fuck".
[05:52:37] <imode> you witness every moment.
[05:53:20] <gwozniak> I remember meeting my wife's great aunt who was 95 at the time. She was not well and died a couple days after I met her. The moment I saw her eyes I knew she didn't have much time left
[05:54:13] <gwozniak> imode: we had a cat that we euthanized when he was 19 years old. We knew it was time because of the way he looked at us
[05:55:35] <imode> poor guy..
[05:56:03] <defect> i went to my grandmas funeral a month ago or so. my grandpa was there, but very quiet and somber. not a very talkative man in general, but you could tell there was something weird
[05:56:18] <defect> and then he died during the funeral service
[05:56:26] <gwozniak> oh wow...
[05:56:39] <defect> seems like he kinda gave up
[05:57:46] <dimadima> woah gwozniak
[05:57:52] <dimadima> i mean defect
[05:57:53] <dimadima> woah
[06:00:06] <companion_cube> defect: that's crazy :/
[06:00:32] <companion_cube> but in a way, for many people, after the death of their SO they just linger a little while and die…
[06:00:47] <dimadima> yeah
[06:00:59] <dimadima> it's hard not to be happy for him, in a way
[06:01:17] <defect> it was pretty crazy. but thinking back at it he died with all his family around him while saying goodbye to his wife
[06:01:21] <dimadima> ...not sure how you or your parents felt...
[06:01:28] <dimadima> yeah
[06:02:42] <gwozniak> Really, it's not a bad way to go
[06:02:49] <companion_cube> yeah seems like a good way to die, all things considered
[06:02:54] <companion_cube> beats dying of covid
[06:03:08] <companion_cube> on a vent, alone, and without oxygen
[06:03:45] <defect> yeah. he had been bed ridden for a long time. so the alternative would be him dying alone at the care facility
[06:07:30] <gwozniak> So not a death story... One night my dad was home with a bunch of his army buddies, drinking like fish.  My mom and sister were away. My brother and I were in our room playing video games and suddenly there's this incredibly loud repeating blast sound coming from the basement
[06:08:27] *** Quits: gthm (~gthm@ip-213-127-57-210.ip.prioritytelecom.net) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[06:08:28] <gwozniak> It was combined with lots of laughing.  Turns out they were firing off blanks from a submachine gun or some semi-automatic weapon they probably weren't supposed to have
[06:08:43] <defect> geez
[06:09:12] <gwozniak> My brother and I can't stand the noise so we leave to go to our friend's house down the road (we live in the country)
[06:09:41] <dimadima> " So not a death story..."
[06:09:44] <dimadima> could have fooled me
[06:09:53] <gwozniak> Halfway there a car pulls out from our driveway and it passes us. It's my dad and his friends, drunk out of their minds laughing it up
[06:10:26] <gwozniak> The car stops a little ahead of us and my dad jumps out, facing me and my brother
[06:10:36] <Church> I'm liking how this had to be prefaced heh
[06:10:42] <gwozniak> Next thing we saw were muzzle flashes. We dove into the ditch
[06:11:04] <dimadima> lololol
[06:11:13] <gwozniak> My dad is just laughing his ass off, and so are his friends.  They jump in the car and tear off
[06:11:28] <dimadima> that's awesome
[06:11:43] <dimadima> your dad and his friends rule
[06:12:05] <gwozniak> When we got to our friend's house we had to try and explain the noise without saying that my dad had fired blanks from a semiautmatic weapon at us while drunk
[06:13:34] <dimadima> that should be in a movie
[06:13:56] <companion_cube> just make sure that on set, it's actually blanks too…
[06:14:08] <gwozniak> Casting Alec Baldwin as my dad
[06:14:22] <companion_cube> yeah don't play yourself :p
[06:14:45] <dimadima> i didn't want to say it
[06:15:25] <dimadima>  < gwozniak> Casting Alec Baldwin as my dad | it would be meta
[06:15:37] <dimadima> can't believe mark zuckerberg ruing the word "meta"
[06:15:44] <Church> Heh
[06:15:53] <companion_cube> from now on, "metaprogramming" will refer to writing php
[06:16:00] <dimadima> lol
[06:16:01] <companion_cube> eat that, lisp addicts
[06:16:04] <gwozniak> I mean, is there anyone with any sense who is excited about this?
[06:16:09] <gwozniak> companion_cube: nice :)
[06:16:14] <companion_cube> I'm sure zuck is excited
[06:16:23] <companion_cube> well, if he's able to
[06:16:39] <companion_cube> I'm not sure I want to picture him in any sort of emotional state
[06:16:50] <gwozniak> I'd prefer not
[06:21:51] <Church> Can we talk about his book end on his shelf however?
[06:22:05] <Church> https://imgur.com/cKOl3by.jpg
[06:22:12] <gwozniak> That's the most important takeaway from all this
[06:23:41] <dimadima> kind of looks like BBQ sauce
[06:23:48] <dimadima> like a bottle of stubbs
[06:24:03] <dimadima> no not stubbs
[06:24:04] <dimadima> the other one
[06:25:24] <dimadima> sweet baby ray's
[06:25:46] <gwozniak> I don't know which one conjures up worse imagery
[06:29:08] <defect> it is sweet baby rays. reference to that video of him barbecuing a few years ago
[06:29:32] <defect> i think they were also talking about sunscreen at one point
[06:30:23] <dimadima> it's all quite meta, huh
[06:31:09] <dimadima> UM
[06:31:17] <dimadima> stfu i was seriously joking
[06:31:30] <dimadima> is it actually sweet baby fucking rays

[06:33:38] <dimadima> how deep into the inner sancta of my psyche has american consumerism penetrated that i took once glance at that and knew what it was
[06:33:46] <dimadima> jesus
[06:34:40] <imode> baaaaaaack.
[06:35:01] <imode> he looks like a god damn tree frog.
[06:35:05] <gwozniak> Genuinely normal human
[06:35:22] <imode> it's the eyes.
[06:35:27] <imode> and the smooth skin.
[06:35:36] <imode> he was far more normal looking in college.
[06:37:02] <dimadima> it's the soylent
[06:37:08] <dimadima> BBQ soylent
[06:38:16] <imode> the metaverse stuff makes me incredibly depressed (ha, what doesn't). if you look at the old visions of what the "metaverse" could actually look like, it started as something MOO-like, encouraging and building a computing platform that was shared by default, and building tooling around that so people could be... whoever they wanted to be, whenever they wanted to be.
[06:39:17] <imode> in the same way the early web was about building webpages, the early metaverse was about building things you could toy with, things you could become, and things that you could share with others in a large, persistent virtual world.
[06:39:31] <gwozniak> ``Found an engineer on @Upwork who is helping me create fake and augmented retinas so @sama and his #WorldCoin no longer can viably succeed. We are making tons of retinas by the hour. What a diabolical idea they had which I just destroyed thanks to remote work.''
[06:39:52] <gwozniak> My one crypto nutbar on Twitter is enough entertainment when I need it
[06:39:54] <imode> not everyone is a 3D artist, and not everyone wants to be. not everyone has access to high-end hardware, and not everyone should.
[06:40:57] <imode> the "metaverse" should be a new standard for mediums, not a new medium.
[06:44:54] <imode> "fake and augmented retinas"... do they think we're living in deus ex.
[06:45:00] <imode> my vision is augmented.
[06:52:08] <Xe> i have complicated opinions about this all that i should probably write out if i wasn't so exhausted
[06:53:24] <imode> about the metaverse or deus ex because I'm here for both.
[06:54:10] <Xe> facebook's saccharine view of what they misread out of snow crash
[06:54:21] <imode> ayyyy.
[06:57:18] <imode> I don't think they misread anything out of Snow Crash, I think they salivated over the evil baddies of cline's masturbatory 80's fantasy novel.

[14:07:29] <Brekkjern> kline: Not that the JS is perfect either. It's a bit of a clusterfuck too, but it's at least possible to understand it with a cursory scan over the code
[14:07:43] <Brekkjern> Mostly naming and scoping that is the issue there IMO
[14:07:53] <Brekkjern> But it's JS so does the scoping really matter?
[14:09:26] <Brekkjern> Is there a way to make git use different SSH keys for authentication without modifying the ssh config itself?
[14:10:10] <deadk> it sucks, but i set GIT_SSH to the address of a shell script which takes the key filename from another environment variable
[14:10:19] <Brekkjern> Hmm
[14:10:23] <deadk> er, GIT_SSH_COMMAND, i guess
[14:10:25] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[14:10:32] <Brekkjern> I just found the doc for that too
[14:11:04] <deadk> oh god is it? i don't even know any more. i thought it was just GIT_SSH, said that, quesitoned myself, googled, saw GIT_SSH_COMMAND, then read the man page and it says GIT_SSH
[14:11:13] <deadk> so i guess i should just never doubt myself
[14:11:18] <Brekkjern> core.sshCommand
[14:11:25] <Brekkjern> You can set it in the config now
[14:11:37] <deadk> that's good
[14:12:23] <Brekkjern> Hmm. Does Windows have an always empty file like /dev/null?
[14:16:10] <kline> Brekkjern, NUL
[14:16:42] <kline> i think in the NT/post dos world it \Device\Null
[14:16:45] <kline> but i dont really know
[14:16:51] <kline> what do you need it for?
[14:17:22] <Brekkjern> To pass as a file for the ssh config to override it
[14:19:43] <kline> windows doesnt have the same "everything is a file" mentality so im not sure you can directly do the same thing here
[14:20:07] <Brekkjern> Doesn't really have to be anything special. Just a file that is always empty.
[14:23:01] <kline> #windows will know
[14:23:18] <Brekkjern> I had a quick google and there doesn't seem to be any
[14:23:28] <Brekkjern> I could solve it by just making an empty file somewhere
[14:23:36] <Brekkjern> I just hoped there was a guaranteed one from the OS
[14:25:33] <Brekkjern> kline: But good point in asking them. Giving it a shot anyways :)
[14:25:52] <kline> probably is best to ask them about the idiomatic way
[14:26:07] <kline> if this is something youre doing in powershell or youre otherwise writing the code, they might have a best practice
[14:26:10] <Brekkjern> Well, I don't control how OpenSSH acts, so...
[14:26:50] <kline> its true, but powershell might have related semantics that openssh understands, even if its different from how youd do it in posix
[14:27:02] <Brekkjern> But I'm not running it in PowerShell
[14:27:07] <kline> or windows, generally
[14:27:20] <kline> openssh is smart, itll know its running on windows and make adjustments accordingly
[14:27:44] <Brekkjern> Sure
[14:27:51] <kline> if theres a windows /dev/null equivalent practice that doesnt rely on the filesystem, openssh will probably respect that
[14:28:05] <Brekkjern> Not for the -F switch

[17:47:36] <companion_cube> the gemini task force will hunt you if you extend it
[17:47:41] <dimadima> thats pretty lame
[17:47:55] <dimadima> that is, in fact, really lame
[17:47:56] <dimadima> imo
[17:48:16] <dimadima> no images or inline links... but cgi?
[17:49:09] <gerikson> CGI is brain-dead simple
[17:50:13] <dimadima> it's not that it's simple or complicated it's that it's dynamic
[17:50:44] <dimadima> am i to understand therefore that gemini is trying to support logged in users?
[17:50:49] <dimadima> and per-user page generation?
[17:52:40] <dimadima> i thought it was just static documents
[17:54:01] <Brekkjern> Imagine trying to pre-generate upcoming weather because "muh static content"
[17:54:01] <dimadima> "But since you've agreed to remove it, there's no need to make an ultimatum at all, you can take your time with the next release and don't feel the need to rush it to ship this change."
[17:54:05] <dimadima> what an asshole
[17:54:10] <companion_cube> you can login with client certificates
[17:54:27] <dimadima> Brekkjern: i didn't realize gemini was trying to support such usecases
[17:54:37] <dimadima> i see
[17:54:39] <Brekkjern> dimadima: I don't think it's trying to support jack shit
[17:55:42] <dimadima> that's what i thought!
[17:56:42] <ngoldbaum> gerikson: so is gemini really just a bunch of zoomers cosplaying computing in the 70s and 80s?
[18:01:41] *** ben_ is now known as ben
[18:09:03] <riv> gerikson: pretty nice use of emoji :)
[18:13:53] <kz> Good morning everyone!  Happy friday
[18:14:23] <riv> morning :)
[18:14:29] <dimadima> happy friday
[18:14:32] <riv> hmm amazon offers me 5 quid off if i buy 15 of amazon stuff
[18:14:41] <riv> do they have a decent mouse?
[18:14:51] <riv> im really sick of having a broken scrollwheel
[18:15:00] <riv> but the deal doesn't apply to anything 3rd party
[18:15:09] <dimadima> aren't all mice good these days
[18:15:28] <riv> im not sure, i bought a really weird one i didnt like recently and sent it back D:
[18:15:34] <riv> i find it hard to pick stuff
[18:15:39] <dimadima> what was weird about it
[18:15:47] <dimadima> are some better are working on various surfaces?
[18:15:49] <riv> there's 2 amazon basics mouses..
[18:15:58] <dimadima> hahaha that's annoying
[18:16:14] <companion_cube> I like the vertical mouse I bought
[18:16:20] <companion_cube> slightly better for my wrist I think
[18:16:32] <dimadima> woah vertical mouse. will look that up.
[18:16:55] <companion_cube> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FPAVUHC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
[18:16:57] <buttsbot> Amazon.com: Anker Ergonomic Optical USB Wired Vertical Mouse 1000/1600 DPI, 5 Buttons CE100 : Electronics
[18:17:01] <riv> i cant stand this stuff like 'dpi button', i only ever press it by mistake. its like a caps lock on a mouse
[18:17:16] <riv> that looks like a very nice vertical mouse
[18:17:25] <companion_cube> it's pretty basic, but I like it
[18:17:29] <riv> I have a different one, but i haven't found mouse an issue for me (just keyboard)
[18:17:34] <companion_cube> normal mouse tends to twist my wrist a bit
[18:17:38] <riv> so i never got used to a vertical mouse
[18:18:12] <companion_cube> for me it's switching from one to the other, really
[18:18:43] <pja> Interesting. Cloud storage for borg backups seems to be quite a bit cheaper than the norm. I guess it’s “you’re assumed to be capable of setting this up on your own so no technical support” prices...
[18:19:02] <indigo> Gotta get one of these https://www.amazon.com/Authentic-T-PRO-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B084WPF64N/ref=asc_df_B084WPF64N/
[18:19:04] <buttsbot> Amazon.com: Mad Catz The Authentic R.A.T. PRO X3 Gaming Mouse - Black : Everything Else
[18:19:26] <riv> that looks so cool! can't wait to frag some noobs with it
[18:19:53] <companion_cube> pja: with borg you also need less storage :D
[18:19:56] <companion_cube> typically
[18:20:12] <companion_cube> anyway, I have a borgbase subscription for my machine
[18:21:23] <pja> Yes, borgbase looks good. rsync.net has custom pricing which is 2/3 of their normal prices.
[18:23:03] <pja> I am trying to actually get decent backups setup, finally. Only been intending to do it for ... oo a decade or so.
[18:26:26] <pja> Occasional backups to usb thumb drives don’t really cut it & I am a bad tech person who has been relying on discs not going phut.
[18:30:17] <gwozniak> heh - I have the same problem
[18:32:19] <companion_cube> thumb drive is also good for, like, keys
[18:32:56] <companion_cube> anyway, my laptop now backups every few hours, and it takes 50GB on borgbase
[18:33:01] <companion_cube> that's quite nice really

[21:13:42] <indigo> Probably going to get some vegan food today; our new team member is vegan :-)
[21:13:57] <bkero> Nice, I hope there's some good vegan food near you.
[21:15:08] <indigo> There is! I've always wanted to try Cafe Gratitude
[21:15:31] <imode> vegan food is underrated.
[21:16:38] <companion_cube> the sad thing with vegan food
[21:16:44] <imode> chickpea as a chicken substitute just tastes right.
[21:16:47] <companion_cube> is that with just a bit of cheese it'd be even better vegetarian food
[21:17:01] <imode> do it. hell yeah.
[21:20:28] <imode> if you're a vegitarian you can essentially source from vegan cookbooks and dishes and such and adjust it to your taste. got a buddy that does that.
[21:21:47] <dimadima> indigo: that's so funny you mention that
[21:21:52] <dimadima> Cafe Gratitude, that is
[21:22:28] <dimadima> when you mentioned that your office is in Venice I was going to say I went to a excellent place called Cafe Gratitude in Venice that was terrific
[21:22:38] <dimadima> but somehow i got distracted
[21:22:48] <dimadima> lol
[21:23:24] <dimadima> it was a unique experience because the food was very much what you might make at home; it didn't have that restaurant taste to it
[21:23:42] <dimadima> which overwhelms me
[21:24:47] <dimadima> it was expensive but excellent
[22:24:10] <indigo> I think everyone expects vegan food to be "salad"
[22:24:31] <indigo> But no, you can make it taste real good if you try
[22:25:25] <jjuran> That was weird.  My RPi router's dnsmasq had an incomplete config until I replaced a relative symlink in /etc/dnsmasq to one of its files elsewhere with an absolute symlink.
[22:26:23] <jjuran> It's weird because its been (involuntarily) power-cycled a number of times since anything on it was updated.
[22:27:12] <jjuran> I was able to read the file through the old symlink, so it's not like it got corrupted.
[22:29:20] <imode> indigo: that and tofu. chickpeas and other plant-based stuff is good. iirc the beyond burger stuff is vegan, yeah?
