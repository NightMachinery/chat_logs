[15:52:08] <geekosaur> no, those don't exceed C. they're caused by time compression as speeds *approach* C
[15:52:38] *** Joins: ProfSimm (~ProfSimm@87.227.196.109)
[15:52:41] <ProfSimm> Oh hi
[15:52:47] <ProfSimm> Sorry didn't know the convention
[15:53:12] <geekosaur> anyway it's not because speeds exceed C, it's because of time compression as speeds approach C
[15:54:05] <geekosaur> and also by where the effect is located relative to the observer's reference frame, as compared to the cause
[15:55:05] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: if we start with the premise the universe is functional, wouldn't it follow that the universe is relational in general, as almost all interactions are time-symmetric
[15:55:41] <geekosaur> yes
[15:56:08] <geekosaur> there are a few interactions that violate time symmetry, but not many. this leads to several physics paradoxes
[15:56:40] <geekosaur> more precidely that violate CT or CPT symmetry
[15:57:13] <ProfSimm> Can we represent this nature of reality in a computer based on staying as close to the metal as possible?
[15:57:48] <geekosaur> we can but it's inefficient. this is why so much research into quantum computers
[15:58:24] <ProfSimm> Technically the impulses of energy that travel we looping around. The change that is happening is motion. Motion is in general interaction proximity of two particles, I guess. Reconfiguring the system
[15:58:27] <geekosaur> well. electronic systems handle that okay. it's superposition they don't handle well
[15:58:53] <geekosaur> they're not looping. there's a wave over the whole system
[15:59:31] <geekosaur> "looping" is an interpretation we apply to it. and it mostly breaks down in modern computers because they run too fast for "looping" to accurately describe them
[15:59:32] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: well it's looping from nominal output to nominal input (the power grid provides the energy for the motion to continue). Can't we see it like that
[16:00:25] <geekosaur> the power grid provides energy, yes. this energy (a) counters entropy (b) provides the wave itself via the power supply which is actually a wave conditioner
[16:00:28] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: everything is in a way connected interacting loops, which connect to other loops through input and output
[16:00:38] <geekosaur> you can "see it like that" up to a certain point
[16:00:54] <geekosaur> things break down if you try to take it too far
[16:01:08] <ProfSimm> How do we take it too far
[16:02:10] <ProfSimm> If you see how a human body works it can also be successfully decomposed into loops. Breathing, circulatory system, the nervous system from environment to sensors to mind to actuators to environment and back
[16:02:25] <geekosaur> well, for example, we're at a limit in computer speeds because waves, unlike particles, can "jump barriers" — and above the current (and for the past 10ish years) speed wave behavior dominates particle behavior
[16:03:14] <[exa]> ProfSimm: with some recent systems biology background I need to inform you that the "decomposed into loops" is behind at least 4 levels of naivety :D
[16:03:32] <[exa]> it's alive, everything does everything™
[16:03:42] <ProfSimm> [exa]: well it gets entangled when there are many loops
[16:03:42] <geekosaur> if your example is the humanbody, as longt as you stick to that high level viewpoint you're fine. once you start looking at the proteins that comprise those loops, they don't work unless you assume quantum behavior
[16:04:19] <geekosaur> for example, even a simple benzene rings can't exist under your interpretation. it only works if an "electron" is a probability wave spread over the entire ring
[16:05:01] <[exa]> ProfSimm: the "loops" are very illusory
[16:05:09] <geekosaur> and proteins contain much more complex ring arrangements than benzene, and again only work if you assume quantum wave behavior
[16:05:36] <ProfSimm> [exa]: maybe, but why do all systems organize into such patterns
[16:06:12] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: unfortunately I don't know enough to understand your benzene etc. examples
[16:06:37] <[exa]> ProfSimm: the "all" there is dangerous
[16:07:29] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: you seem to interpret the wave function literally as a probability. What if that probability is emergent from something. We don't know why we need to square the wave function to get the probability for ex. Do we?
[16:07:42] <geekosaur> uh
[16:07:53] <geekosaur> yes, we do. go take a probability and statistics course
[16:08:37] <geekosaur> it's been a looong time since I took one, but the square is part of the probability
[16:08:50] <ProfSimm> Well I've heard physicists who won Nobels for this type of work who say we don't know why squaring gives us the probability
[16:09:26] <ProfSimm> Because the wave function oscillates in a complex plane of sort. And we don't know why the probability is higher on both ends of this oscillation. 
[16:10:03] <[exa]> the electrons stick there better
[16:10:07] <[exa]> literally ^
[16:10:19] <ProfSimm> Could be :)
[16:10:21] <geekosaur> I think that one is equivalent to saying we don't understand why the wavefunction takes that particular form instead of some other one
[16:10:50] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: well Schrodinger claimed he didn't know why this own model works. 
[16:10:53] <geekosaur> the Schrödinger equation is a general wave equation. we just don't understand why it's that one and not some other wave equation that works
[16:10:54] <ProfSimm> his*
[16:11:06] <ProfSimm> Yex
[16:11:07] <ProfSimm> yes
[16:11:17] <[exa]> ProfSimm: you're struggling with having absolute definitions in a system where absolution is unknown or nonexistent, that's normal. Adapt a simpler model first, and be ready for ditching it at the right time.
[16:11:30] <geekosaur> but that doesn't mean probability is emergent, except as seen from outside — but we can never see it from outside, so irrelevant
[16:12:07] <geekosaur> or, equivalently, what [exa] just said :)
[16:12:35] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: do you think probability is an actual property of the universe, not emergent from say noise components at lower levels summing up to pseudo-random output (because we don't have all the system's state at that scale)
[16:12:36] <geekosaur> the system an only be absolute from outside. otherwise the best we can do is relative to itself
[16:13:09] <geekosaur> ProfSimm, that's a very open — and contentious — question in fundamental physics
[16:13:33] <ProfSimm> [exa]: sometimes I think the universe is so relative, that even rules of logic and math are relative. Depending on where in the multiverse you are.
[16:13:38] <geekosaur> I lean toward "all variables are hidden". Hawking was firmly in the "no variables are hidden" camp
[16:15:02] <ProfSimm> Numbers are in essence first a system of counting. But to count it means you discretize phenomena into countable objects, and those don't really objectively exist as discrete. They all interact. They just have boundaries where they interact "less", than they interact internally
[16:15:26] <geekosaur> that just means you're using the wronmg kind of math
[16:15:49] <ProfSimm> Well I mean, nothing is objectively countable. Only subjectively
[16:16:02] <geekosaur> which is the cool thing about math: you can change your rules and get a different system which might (but that's only an after the fact benefit) be useful for something
[16:16:47] <geekosaur> and "in essence first a system of counting" — complex numbers? infinitesimals?
[16:16:55] <geekosaur> quaternions?
[16:17:12] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: well I'm historically accounting for how we evolved numbers. One cow, two cows...
[16:17:31] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: as you add calculus and so on, it becomes interesting of course
[16:17:42] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: that said I don't think "real numbers"... are... well.. real
[16:17:51] <hpc> zero cows, one cow, infinity cows
[16:18:32] <ProfSimm> Math is a self-consistent set of rules, which we're able to map to the world to derive quantitative properties of the systems around us
[16:18:44] <geekosaur> not always
[16:18:47] <ProfSimm> But technically every time we map math to reality we do it subjectively and approximately
[16:18:55] <[exa]> so what. :D
[16:19:05] <geekosaur> even "self-consistent set of rules" is dubious (thanks Gödel)
[16:19:13] <ProfSimm> Well, mostly self-consistent
[16:19:22] <ProfSimm> Let's not be perfectionists now :P
[16:19:22] <hpc> geekosaur: heh, i was going to say axiom of choice
[16:19:28] <geekosaur> and there is literally zero guarantee that a mathematical system is useful in the real world
[16:19:35] <hpc> is our self-consistent set of rules ZF or ZFC?
[16:19:44] <Rembane> hpc: Is that Fatboy Slim's song but with math? 
[16:20:14] <hpc> Rembane: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_one_infinity_rule
[16:20:23] <ProfSimm> So essentially what I figure out is that we can't even say math is valid right here and now.
[16:20:36] <geekosaur> which is correct
[16:20:47] <ProfSimm> It's just (mostly) self-consistent, and we have luck mapping it to systems to derive useful predictions
[16:21:14] <geekosaur> but "the perfect is the enemy of the good" which is why maps aren't based on elliptical geometry

[16:26:59] <hpc> like functions, every input has one output, not infinity outputs
[16:27:32] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: the equal temperament tuning is in fact just an approximation of the correct ratios of tone to tone. And most successful one because it can be transposed. I wonder what this says about reality. That it really likes synergies, even if they're aproximate.
[16:28:05] <geekosaur> reality just prefers a different abstraction
[16:28:13] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: what is it
[16:29:20] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: I sometimes imagine the universe as a sort of "wavelet" compressed structure. Where every pattern of vibration is expressed once, and entangled to others to provide that pattern without duplication
[16:29:29] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: and things that are similar merge
[16:29:34] <ProfSimm> similar enough.
[16:29:43] <ProfSimm> Because you'll never have an exact match
[16:30:24] <geekosaur> but there are merges between dissimilar things. and things that are similar enough to have harmonic relationships don't necessarily merge, and in fact may be prevented from merging by that relationship
[16:30:50] <geekosaur> the universe likes harmonics and doesn't care that we think transposing them is a good idea
[16:31:01] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: harmonic relationship may have some common component we don't see.
[16:31:30] <geekosaur> huh? harmonic relationship *is* the common component
[16:32:02] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: for example what if nature can combine patterns by scaling them, reversing them and so on. Then the harmonic relationship may be one pattern with a scaling factor between two expressions of it
[16:32:36] <geekosaur> your "what if" is reality
[16:32:37] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: well I'm trying to materialize it somehow in my head
[16:34:25] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: could we express then everything in the universe as a set of vibrations and a sum/product relationship between them? Well that's algebraic, it's how neural networks work, so I guess the answer is yes. I only don't know where transcendental numbers come from
[16:35:02] <geekosaur> from flattening waves to a grid
[16:35:11] <geekosaur> or s/flattening/relating/
[16:35:26] <ProfSimm> why do we think in grids then
[16:35:34] <ProfSimm> Where does the grid itself come from
[16:35:39] <geekosaur> because it's easier to "one cow, two cows"
[16:36:25] <geekosaur> and the perfect is the enemy of the good, so we developed a "good enough" that doesn't actually represent the universe that well except in sufficiently localized contexts
[16:36:36] <ProfSimm> While nature thinks in superposition of pi count of cow-fields :P?
[16:37:02] <geekosaur> nature doesn't care how many cows there are. it cares how they're related to each other
[16:37:43] <ProfSimm> Aren't we part of nature?
[16:38:21] <geekosaur> yes, but our relationship to cows is we either want to eat or milk them. natural relationships go beyond that
[16:38:43] <geekosaur> other predators, food, reproduction, etc.
[16:39:39] <geekosaur> I kinda feel like you're trying to go abstract without choosing an abstraction, so you're fluttering all over the place without finding a landing spot
[16:40:26] <geekosaur> there is not one single abtraction to rule all abstractions (or reality for that matter). you choose an appropriate abstraction for your intent

[16:41:20] <ProfSimm> Well, geekosaur, I wanna thank you and everyone about this chat. Your perspective is very interesting to me. Gotta go but thanks for the chat.
[16:42:27] <geekosaur> you might want to meditate on why Haskell has both Monad and Applicative, and Monad derives from Applicative, but there are things Applicative can do that Monad can't and vice versa
[16:42:55] <geekosaur> which cuts very directly to what I said about there being no single all-encompassing abstraction
[16:43:42] <geekosaur> you abstract *over* something. what you abstract over determines the usefulness of your abstraction in various circumstances
[16:44:30] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: basically my focal point is "what is the best foundation upon which to built everything else". And if it can't be abstract, then I want the dirty specifics and start from there. 
[16:45:16] <ProfSimm> geekosaur: as string theory shows, our ever-lasting attempts to find a "simple theory of everything" usually end up as systems that are both not simple, and also describe a reality that can be literally anything at all
[16:45:24] <ProfSimm> But I think we'll keep trying

[17:01:41] <geekosaur> boy are they in trouble
[17:03:47] <geekosaur> I mean, there's a model of the universe based on an 8-gauge symmetry. mathematically simple and elegant but beyond the ken of most humans…
[17:04:11] <geekosaur> nobody ever promised the univer would be comprehensible to us

[23:57:44] <ProfSimm> A function's inputs and outputs are a bit like connecting two modules through bunch of wires. One way to encode arguments is by order. Another way is to encode them by name (like in records). Is there a third way which doesn't rely on order, or names?
