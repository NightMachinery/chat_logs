[04:35:33] <Comet> g'day friends, i'm looking for some information on playback buffers. if i exit my client and reconnect sometime later in the future, i miss everything that happens in the channels while i'm gone. do i need to be using a playback module of sorts? I see some info online on znc-playback but it's about 6 years old, just wanted to make sure it's the most up-to-date info.

[07:47:32] <Comet> if i quit hexchat, have a convo on the mobile, and reconnect on hexchat, none of the history is saved. so must be a client identifier thing

[16:45:28] <Khaytsus> faxmodem: Where is your znc server located?  If it's in your house, and your house lost internet....
[16:50:35] <faxmodem> Khaytsus: yes it is :)
[16:51:06] <faxmodem> Khaytsus: I was hoping it was possible to retain channel log history after a disconnect
[16:51:33] <Khaytsus> So just to be clear, your entire ISP/internet went out yes?
[16:51:35] <faxmodem> but I only have logs after the cut, not before
[16:51:45] <faxmodem> Khaytsus: yes
[16:52:03] <Khaytsus> So of course znc isn't going to have any history while it's offline
[16:52:41] <Khaytsus> And any previous history doesn't just load up if it's already been seen, you could use the playback module or such if you want to see that.  znc doesn't have some kind of slack-like infinite scrolling back of history.
[16:53:19] <MetaNova> while it's true ZNC won't cache anything while there is no internet connection, I recall there being reported issues with a disconnect invalidating/erasing the unseen cache leading up to that point
[16:53:25] <MetaNova> but I've never attempted to replicate this
[16:53:41] <faxmodem> how does it tell seen from unseen?
[16:53:53] <MetaNova> that only matters if AutoClearQueryBuffer = true
[16:53:53] <faxmodem> because all my channels in irssi behave the same
[16:54:58] <MetaNova> faxmodem: bottom line, if you want reliable and consistent buffer playback, enable persistent buffers
[16:55:09] <MetaNova> see steps 1 and 2 at https://wiki.znc.in/Multiple_clients#Full_overview
[16:56:21] <Khaytsus> MetaNova: Ah yeah now that you mention that, I've seen someone mention that before too.  
[16:56:47] <MetaNova> Khaytsus: I recall 2 separate times those particular circumstances were mentioned
[16:56:56] <MetaNova> but I've not experienced this myself
[16:57:11] *** Quits: hisacro (~OBSD@my.displ.nl) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[16:57:27] <MetaNova> if ZNC were restarted, perhaps as a troubleshooting step, that would naturally murder the buffers
[16:58:42] <faxmodem> I think that was me earlier
[16:59:00] <faxmodem> and I did step 1 and 2
[16:59:01] <MetaNova> last time I recall hearing about it was when #znc was on freenode
[16:59:39] <MetaNova> faxmodem: if you have persistent buffers, you should be good to go
[16:59:46] <MetaNova> assuming no buffersize is set to 0
[17:02:35] <MetaNova> <faxmodem> how does it tell seen from unseen?
[17:02:38] <MetaNova> it doesn't actually
[17:02:47] <MetaNova> if a buffer exists, ZNC will play it
[17:03:08] <MetaNova> then, if AutoClear(Chan|Query)Buffer is true, it'll erase that buffer
[17:03:25] <faxmodem> having both vars described in above url set to false = persistentbuffers ?
[17:03:32] <MetaNova> correct
[17:03:46] <faxmodem> well those are both false
[17:03:57] <MetaNova> then it seems you have persistent buffers, already
[17:05:03] <faxmodem> but irssi runs on same host, and dorsnt lose connection to znc while isp is down
[17:05:12] <faxmodem> maybe thats the problem ?
[17:10:09] <MetaNova> with persistent buffers it *shouldn't* matter if one (or many) or none clients were connected, ZNC shouldn't clear the buffers

[21:42:58] <Kniaz> any suggestions what I should be done to get rid of this warning and keep functionality?
[21:49:13] <Khaytsus> First off, probably look into route replies if you're seeing this on mulitple clients.
[21:49:25] <Khaytsus> Second..  fix whatever script is spamming the network with WHO requests
