[05:03:44] <LjL> berndj, i'd say that's not really a sound reasoning though... because English has https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unaccusative_verb#Unaccusativity_in_English
[05:04:15] <LjL> "The request has completed." is perfectly good English, it doesn't have to be "The request has been completed.", as it would in some other languages
[05:04:27] <LjL> (in fact the latter sounds slightly off)
[05:05:29] <LjL> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediopassive_voice#English has some even more glaring examples, at least glaring to speakers of languages that don't feature this switcharoo thing
[05:07:57] <berndj> LjL, while i can "think myself into" what you mean, i get the feeling there are two different kinds of "request"
[05:08:32] <berndj> one (which i was originally thinking of) is one that a requester makes and that somebody else executes
[05:08:32] <LjL> "think myself into" :P that's quite medio-passive
[05:09:22] <berndj> but maybe there's also a "reified request" that's like a first-class object that has methods make() and complete() (to cast this into programming-esque terms)
[05:09:58] <berndj> hah, that wiki link reminds me of "it rains"
[05:10:03] <mdogg> To me, "The request has completed" sounds odd.  I would say 'The request has been completed'.  
[05:10:17] <LjL> yes, but it's not always easy to put a line on the difference between the thing as being "done" by someone else, versus being considered reified and "ending" or "completing" or "finishing" stuff on its own
[05:10:26] <LjL> anyway yes i'm not saying either a) or b) is bad. just i wouldn't use that argument to argue for either
[05:11:24] <berndj> yeah i don't want to be the (a)-or-(b) nazi either, i was really just commenting on which one "sounded right" to me (or rather, "more right", or even "less wrong"), with an attached retconned explanation
[05:12:23] <LjL> https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=_NOUN_+has+completed+_END_%2C_NOUN_+has+been+completed+_END_&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=26&smoothing=3&direct_url=t1%3B%2C_NOUN_%20has%20completed%20_END_%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C_NOUN_%20has%20been%20completed%20_END_%3B%2Cc0
[05:12:35] <LjL> (not entirely sure what's going on between 1920 and 1940 there :P)
[05:13:49] <LjL> berndj, honestly i'd probably use (a) as well... and i guess my retconned explanation is uh... i might find (b) more "regular english" but (a) sounds more formal or less rude. not that (a) sounds rude but it's a bit impersonal and abrupt.
[05:14:07] <mdogg> They both could be correct.  It's just that the first one sounds strange to me.  
[05:14:24] *** Quits: great_taste (~great_tas@190.32.235.20) (Quit: Client closed)
[05:14:37] <LjL> also there is a tendency for more formal english to parrot the rules of other european languages like french. stated like that it sounds a bit judgmental i guess, but one adapts to the register one expects others to expect
[05:15:27] <LjL> when making an inquiry one usually want to be nice, kind and a little formal unless you're asking your friend a question, so a higher register usually doesn't hurt unless it's way too high
[05:15:42] <LjL> but i'm admittedly splitting hairs
[05:16:52] <berndj> i don't know if it's a tendency to parrot the rules; i suspect it's more that (highly competent) non-native speakers are more aware of the "rules" that make things "sound right"
[05:17:33] <LjL> berndj, well historically English did just that, though
[05:17:36] <berndj> native speakers just learned all those rules implicitly as children, and can't always express what linguistic structures they're following
[05:17:44] <LjL> "no split infinitives": why? because of Latin, duh. English must work the same
[05:17:59] <LjL> "attorney general": why not "general attorney"? because French sometimes has adjectives after the noun, duh.
[05:18:11] <LjL> i'm already out of examples but
[05:18:24] <berndj> last time i bumped into "no split infinitives" it seemed like it was never really a "rule"
[05:18:47] <LjL> whenever something is touted as a "rule" in language, doubt it :P unless it's very explicitly a descriptive rule
[05:19:22] <berndj> the people touting "no split infinitives" didn't have much authority though, as far as i could tell
[05:19:35] <LjL> well, it largely didn't "take"
[05:19:56] <LjL> but i usually say "not to go" instead of "to not go" myself, so with "not" at least, it "took" even on this non-native speaker
[05:20:11] <berndj> they'd be hypercorrecting school teachers and victorian-era yuppies that made up that pseudo-rule (the one about infinitives)
[05:20:41] <berndj> i consider "not to go" and "to not go" to have different meanings, so i use both on different occasions :)
[05:20:51] <LjL> i also say "... than I do", because "... than I" sounds way stilted, but if i say "... than me" someone will complain it's "wrong" :P
[05:21:37] <LjL> and i'm usually not even that big on compromises!

[05:27:00] <LjL> berndj, piove, yes. however the lack of "it" is just standard with our verbs, we don't specify a pronoun unless we need to stress it for some reason
[05:27:20] <LjL> CuriosTiger, we say that too, although not with "rain". we say "fa freddo", "fa caldo"
[05:27:28] <berndj> ah so not special to weather verbs

[05:27:57] <CuriosTiger> "caldo" meaning "heat" used to mess me up when I was younger
[05:28:14] <CuriosTiger> because "kald" in Norwegian (cognate with English cold, German Kalt) means the exact opposite.
[05:28:39] <LjL> berndj, no, for example the normal way i'd say "I don't want anything, thanks" is "non voglio niente, grazie". but if someone else was asked a moment before and they said they wanted something, then for contrast i would typically say "io non voglio niente, grazie"
[05:28:52] <LjL> CuriosTiger, yeah it messes us up the opposite way :P
[05:28:54] <berndj> CuriosTiger, yeah that's tripped me up too (german here)! i have a potential mnemonic though: caldo is scalding
[05:29:01] <LjL> i was musing with someone earlier
[05:29:30] <CuriosTiger> berndj: I mean, it's not far away from Kälte either.
[05:29:42] <CuriosTiger> So if you hear "caldo" and expect "Kälte", you're in for a surprise. :P
[05:29:46] <berndj> LjL, ah, the latter is more like "*I* don't want anything [, but that other person might]"?
[05:30:08] <LjL> "travail" means work in french. but "travaglio" means labor (as in after pregnancy) in italian. but "lavoro" (cognate with labor) means work. and in English, "travel" which does also come from "travail" means, well, travel :P
[05:30:29] <berndj> CuriosTiger, right, i wonder now how hotel shower water fixtures are labeled
[05:30:33] <CuriosTiger> In Spanish, I'd use something like "Yo tampoco no quiero nada".
[05:30:42] <LjL> berndj, yes, you usually render it in english by just stressing the pronoun like you did in writing, or by changing the sentence (for example, "it's not me who did..." as opposed to just "I didn't do...")
[05:30:45] <CuriosTiger> berndj: Presumably "F" and "C".
[05:31:00] <LjL> they usually just have a red and a blue color coding here
[05:31:03] <CuriosTiger> LjL: Or a simple "Nothing for me either."
[05:31:08] <berndj> ah the false friends. also "embarrazado" in spanish
[05:31:11] <LjL> i hope red and blue mean roughly the same thing for everyone :P
[05:31:19] <CuriosTiger> "Embarazada". Pregnant. :P
[05:31:31] <LjL> heh right. it does just mean embarrassed in italian so that's a false friend for me too
[05:31:31] <CuriosTiger> and somehow, I can't ever remember the actual Spanish word for embarrassed. :P
[05:31:36] <berndj> yeah sorry i didn't remember how it declines
[05:31:40] <LjL> there are actually a good amount of false friends between spanish and italian
[05:31:54] <CuriosTiger> avergonzada. I had to look it up.

[05:32:16] <LjL> ah, same root
[05:32:19] <CuriosTiger> seems related to avergonzada.

[05:34:20] <CuriosTiger> Doesn't Dutch do it too?
[05:34:46] <berndj> naïve is a bit loanword-ey though. then again, is there anything in english that isn't a loanword?
[05:34:48] <CuriosTiger> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_terms_spelled_with_%C3%8F <-- but disclaimer, most every word on this list is more commonly spelled with a regular i.
[05:35:26] <berndj> i don't know about dutch but in afrikaans the diaresis is used to mark an omission(?)
[05:35:27] <CuriosTiger> berndj: Well, "English" is a loan word from some form of proto-Germanic.
[05:35:41] <CuriosTiger> although in that case it's probably more fair to call it a descendant than a loan. :P
[05:35:54] <LjL> well... there's usually a definite difference
[05:36:10] <berndj> like dutch might have "regen" (rain, i'm not sure if it's the actual word), so afrikaans made that "reën"
[05:36:17] <LjL> like for example (recently example i paid attention to): in Spanish, there are two words, "menudo" (small, minute) and "minuto" (minute in the sense of a fraction of an hour)
[05:36:21] <LjL> both come from the same latin word minutus
[05:36:30] <LjL> but menudo is descended, minuto is a later loan
[05:36:35] <CuriosTiger> Regen is definitely the word in German, and I think it's the same in Dutch.
[05:36:52] <LjL> there's a ton of those things in italian too, although the go-to example i remember (i'm bad with examples) is "macina" vs "macchina"
[05:37:07] <berndj> macchina = car?
[05:37:09] <CuriosTiger> LjL: Yea. English has a score of these, where both are loans, but one directly from Latin and one via Norman French.
[05:37:17] <LjL> both come from latin "machina" (itself a loan from greek), but... yes, macchine = car, or in general machine
[05:37:19] <CuriosTiger> warranty/guarantee is the most commonly cited example.
[05:37:36] <LjL> while macina, the directly descended form, because "the" machine par excellence, in its era

[05:38:18] <CuriosTiger> and the car was probably the ultimate "machina" in ITS epoch when that word was given to it.

[05:38:47] <LjL> CuriosTiger, right! although the word "macchina" was by then already in common uses for other things like trains

[05:39:19] <CuriosTiger> That's a funny one too.

[05:40:34] <CuriosTiger> Spanish does its b to v thing with Automovil, but European Spanish more commonly uses el coche.
[05:40:38] <LjL> because "auto" means so many other things in those languages
[05:40:43] <CuriosTiger> which looks suspiciously close to English "coach".

[05:41:08] <LjL> the formal word for airplane in italian is "aeroplano" but we commonly say "aereo" (which is literally just "airy")
[05:41:20] <berndj> CuriosTiger, you mean the "zeug" thing?
[05:41:22] <CuriosTiger> Rather than create or borrow a new word, they combine existing words to create new compound words
[05:41:26] <CuriosTiger> not just zeug
[05:41:38] <LjL> that also results in a lot of people misspelling the former as "aereoplano" (and same for airport, *"aereoporto")
[05:41:38] <berndj> you mean the agglutinative-language thing?
[05:41:59] <CuriosTiger> I'm not sure German quite qualifies as an agglutinative language, but its nouns certainly are.
[05:42:21] <CuriosTiger> Handschuhe: Hand shoe.
[05:42:30] <CuriosTiger> (glove)
[05:42:30] <berndj> actually i don't know if "-zeug" is really "-thing"; it could also be something like "-vehicle"
[05:42:42] <CuriosTiger> Scheinwerfer: Shine thrower (headlight)
[05:42:53] <CuriosTiger> Staubsauger: Dust sucker (vacuum cleaner)
[05:42:57] <LjL> i think "agglutinative" tends to refer more to grammatical morphemes
[05:43:29] <CuriosTiger> berndj: "-thing" is good a translation as any. It could also mean "-tool" or "-actor" or a number of other suffixes, depending on the word it's paired with.
[05:44:30] <berndj> CuriosTiger, yeah i just remembered earlier that afrikaans has "-tuig" (or rarely a standalone word "tuig") that's approximately "vehicle"
[05:44:59] <CuriosTiger> Probably cognate.
[05:45:02] <berndj> "ruimtetuig" is a spaceship, a space-vehicle. a "tuig" is a thing that travels somehow
[05:45:15] <CuriosTiger> German also uses -stoff (cognate with "stuff", but really means something more like "substance")
[05:45:30] <CuriosTiger> so ie. oxygen is Sauerstoff: "sour substance".
[05:45:51] <berndj> "zeug" can also be "stuff"!
[05:45:53] <CuriosTiger> Raumschiff would be German for space ship, but Raumfahrzeug is not implausible.
[05:46:54] <berndj> i feel like "Raumfahrzeug" implies some more steerability than "Raumschiff" does
[05:48:39] <berndj> i remember reading a rather funny chemistry joke involving "water stuff" and "sour stuff" as a result of translating from german

[06:56:15] <Belamos> hi
[06:56:38] <Belamos> Can I use "late" only when it comes to a husband / wife or also in regards to other people?
[06:56:50] <Belamos> e.g.  "my late husband loved watching birds in the garden"
[06:56:54] <LjL> as in "dead"? you can use it with anyone, "the late John Smith"
[06:57:01] <Belamos> could it also be a "late child" (if deceased) or a "late friend" ?
[06:57:16] <LjL> "late child", i suppose, but i'd say that sounds unusual
[06:57:22] <LjL> "late friend" i'd say yup
[06:57:32] <Belamos> thank you, LjL 
[06:57:40] <Belamos> LjL, just to be sure: are you a native English speaker?
[06:57:58] <LjL> nope, but i try to say things only when i feel reasonably confident about them :)

[06:58:56] <Belamos> makes sense :) Thank you LjL 
[06:59:26] <berndj> "late child" might sound unusual because it's rare
[06:59:51] <LjL> i'd expect "late son" or "late daughter"

[07:00:08] <berndj> i've definitely heard "late son/daughter"

[07:02:18] <LjL> well that's long
[07:02:56] <Belamos> does "late" also work with animals?
[07:02:59] <Belamos> my late cat?

[07:03:12] <LjL> that would sound a bit contrived, even silly
[07:03:25] <Belamos> ok... so no late animals then
[07:03:27] <Belamos> thank you
[07:03:38] <LjL> i removed "my late husband/wife" and "the late John" because they just squished the other lines to the bottom
[07:03:51] <LjL> but this shows that "son" or "daugher" is much more common than "child" in this collocation

[08:10:17] <twomoon> the first one is less formal sounding

[08:10:45] <brigand> the second sounds more poetic
[08:11:16] <twomoon> the first one is less formal because it doesn't specify exactly what is being added
[08:11:39] <twomoon> it just implies idiomatically that something positive is being added

[17:12:30] <darsie> The SAT (/ˌɛsˌeɪˈtiː/ ess-ay-TEE) is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. Since its debut in 1926, its name and scoring have changed several times; originally called the Scholastic Aptitude Test, it was later called the Scholastic Assessment Test, then the SAT I: Reasoning Test, then the SAT Reasoning Test, then simply the SAT. 
[17:14:32] <darsie> How well does SAT correlate with success?
[17:15:16] <Me-me> Probably pretty well inasmuch as academic performance tends to correlate with success. There's arguments to be made about the correlation with socioeconomic happenstance, mind.

[21:02:05] <ciphrCat> “Working with Indigenous Peoples” ← that shit annoys the fuck out of me. “People” is inherently plural, so why do they feel they need to suffix an “s”?  (from https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/new-mexico/)
[21:02:48] <ciphrCat> are they trying to say there are multiple groups of people?

[21:06:13] <ciphrCat> and so if they were to say “working with indigenous people”, are they concerned that the reader would believe they are working with just one tribe and excluding the others?
[21:07:28] <ciphrCat> i think “people” can also be used to cover multiple groups of people, because who’s to say how the groups are divided?
[21:10:02] *** Quits: spinningcat (~spinningc@94.54.234.81) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[21:10:23] <ciphrCat> we can refer to the single “group” of humans to capture all human beings, and refer to them as “people”.  In the case at hand, they imply all those that are indigenous which can also be referred to as a single group, so I don't see the point to trying to divide further into multiple smaller groups
[21:11:26] <ciphrCat> e.g. we say “we the people believe that Trump is a scumbag”.. we don't say “we the peoples believe that Trump is a scumbag”
[21:12:42] <ciphrCat> yet there are countless many groups who would be in the “Trump is a scumbag” camp
