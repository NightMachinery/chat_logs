[00:22:33] <blackpill0w> ButterNoodle: you're right fuck windows

[00:24:06] <ButterNoodle> I have no opinion
[00:24:17] <flyke> blackpill0w: I wanna move to arch but looks that will be pain in the ass moving the home directory and partitioning again..
[00:24:18] <DaPinkOne> GUIs are generally fine. electron apps are abomination

[00:26:35] <blackpill0w> flyke: personally, I have a seperate partition where I keep backups, I run a script to restore everything after instalation
[00:27:05] <flyke> My plan is shrink the current manjaro partition, create partition from free space, and then install->boot->cp /mnt/home ./home->delete manjaro partition->profit
[00:27:06] <ButterNoodle> I mean.. tar -Jcvf /mnt/usb/home.tar.xz /home
[00:27:14] <ButterNoodle> or use fsarchiver
[00:27:17] <Sapphirus> y not zst
[00:27:24] <ButterNoodle> idk
[00:27:33] <ButterNoodle> whats the switch
[00:27:50] <blackpill0w> I use rsync, it keeps permission and everything, does tar keep owner and other metadata?
[00:27:50] <Sapphirus> it's faster than rar or xz and is about as good
[00:28:01] <ButterNoodle> yea
[00:28:04] <ButterNoodle> whats the switch tho
[00:28:06] <ButterNoodle> Z
[00:28:19] <ButterNoodle> man tar
[00:28:23] <Sapphirus> A since i'm not aware of tar having an official switch for it yet
[00:28:32] <ButterNoodle> yea thats why I dont use it
[00:28:35] <Sapphirus> so you have to use the auto switch with the appropriate libs installed
[00:29:33] <Sapphirus> it'll eventually get a switch lol
[00:29:38] <Sapphirus> i can't see it not
[00:29:44] <ButterNoodle> *then I'll use it :)
[00:30:00] <ButterNoodle> it is more efficient on create.. which is where xz fails
[00:30:33] <ButterNoodle> I still xz my VMs.. takes forever
[00:30:34] <Sapphirus> far more efficient on extraction, too
[00:30:47] <Sapphirus> and the highest, slowest compression ratio beats rar 
[00:31:14] <ButterNoodle> doesnt matter on time.. I dont need those threads, those boxes are almost idle
[00:35:44] <flyke> okay
[00:35:49] <flyke> gonna download Arch
[00:35:55] <flyke> or is there a better distro?
[00:36:06] <ButterNoodle> no
[00:36:18] <ButterNoodle> dont use the shitty installer
[00:36:31] <blackpill0w> why not?
[00:36:37] <ButterNoodle> ^ its shitty
[00:36:46] <blackpill0w> not really
[00:36:50] <blackpill0w> its pretty fine
[00:36:57] <flyke> shitty installer?
[00:37:09] <Bco1981> didn't work for me. my vm wouldn't boot
[00:37:16] <ButterNoodle> check the wiki - they have the official way to install documented
[00:37:35] <blackpill0w> archfi worked fine for me, multiple times
[00:37:43] <Bco1981> just get the partitioning right.
[00:37:54] <ButterNoodle> I have a well regimented script to install
[00:37:59] <blackpill0w> it saves the headache I had the first time I installed it
[00:38:23] <flyke> I think I'll use the chroot method
[00:38:34] <ButterNoodle> *one does not install arch on the first try
[00:38:45] <ButterNoodle> flyke: yep
[00:38:49] <Bco1981> can confirme
[00:38:51] <blackpill0w> oh, right, if you don't the partitioning right you might fuck up
[00:39:13] <flyke> Like, chroot from my manjaro to the arch root and install from there
[00:39:19] <Bco1981> starting with the type of drive
[00:39:56] <blackpill0w> actually, I founed out that if you read the damn wiki without skipping things you'd understand everything
[00:39:56] <Bco1981> if you chose the wrong kind of drive type, then if you chose the wrong bootloader, you fucked.
[00:40:15] <flyke> blackpill0w, yeah I'm prioritising a clean install. After all this is my parent computer
[00:40:25] <blackpill0w> bro, just go to disks app in manjaro and take picture
[00:40:54] <flyke> ok
[00:41:30] <Bco1981> like i said, the partitions wasn't the problem for me. it wsa the choice of disk type when opening fdisk/cfdisk, then later picking the wrong bootloader.
[00:41:43] <blackpill0w> flyke: like I said, archfi worked well for me, you can see some youtube vid to make sure everything is right
[00:42:12] <blackpill0w> Bco1981: why? the boot partition if efi, otherwise the main partition
[00:42:24] <Bco1981> it's not on a virtualbox vm

[00:45:56] <flyke> hm
[00:45:57] <flyke> no
[00:47:47] <blackpill0w> well then the thing is fairly simple, boot arch usb, connect to inernet and download the script

[06:01:04] <ButterNoodle> 308 -> 30-06 -> 300wm -> 300rum
[06:01:15] <ButterNoodle> depending on how far out u wanna go
[06:01:27] <ButterNoodle> deer to 200m w 308
[06:01:37] <MootPoot> ~500m max at range, hunting max 250 maybe

[06:41:16] <Sapphirus> It was a rhetorical question but it seems to have completely slipped your grasp.
[06:41:49] <MootPoot> A question has some kind of basis you use to spring it
[06:41:56] <MootPoot> stop dodging 
[06:42:03] <Sapphirus> I'm not dodging. It literally was a rhetorical question.
[06:42:34] <MootPoot> If the topic was never there you never would have asked this question - a la - you used something I said as a point to ask your question
[06:42:35] <Sapphirus> Fact you're answering it like so, means you've failed to grasp the purpose of said comment.

[06:49:32] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, okay, so why did you respond to a rhetorical question as if it were an actual question engaging inquiry? Given your demeanor, it seemed to me as if it were intentional to pick a fight.
[06:50:03] <Sapphirus> I'm willing to listen to a reasonable explanation which doesn't devolve into 'but nou'.
[06:50:21] <MootPoot> your "question" sounded more like a jab at my motivations/views then a question
[06:50:42] <MootPoot> "What's wrong with that" = "Why do you think that's wrong" ( veiled )
[06:50:51] <Sapphirus> No, it wasn't. Literally was a rhetorical question supporting the idea there's nothing wrong with the premise in question.
[06:51:11] <MootPoot> but nobody was contesting the premise?
[06:51:22] <Sapphirus> You are misconstruing that to fit your own negative view.
[06:51:25] <MootPoot> there was no premise - nor was it an argument
[06:51:38] <Sapphirus> I wasn't even contesting the premise.

[06:52:22] <MootPoot> Then why not just say "Yeah, that's fine too" ( doing work only for money)
[06:52:38] <Sapphirus> You seemed to have taken this as a personal jab when that comment was never written with any such intention.
[06:52:43] <MootPoot> alright - fine
[06:52:49] <MootPoot> I'll take you at your word
[06:55:44] <MootPoot> The only reason it was interpeted as such is because you did this before - accusing me of having views that were pushed in by media / me having ulterior motivations. Had it come from Sadale for example I'd probably have percived it as just a question with nothing behind it
[06:58:36] <Sapphirus> You then bridged that into a completely, totally irrelevant piece of commentary to those accusations.
[06:59:33] <Sapphirus> Which to be incredibly fair, I stand behind, because I don't think your views on that matter are cogent.
[06:59:47] <Sapphirus> But that doesn't mean I can't move on from that.
[06:59:49] <MootPoot> I'm sorry if I have some set of apprehensions about a person when the last time I talked to them - they did the exact thing 
[07:00:24] <MootPoot> I'd expect it again
[07:01:08] <Sapphirus> I'm still not entirely convinced those views you expressed are your own and are otherwise uninfluenced -- but that's an entirely separate conversation to be had.
[07:01:17] <Sapphirus> I don't think us discussing that would change anything.
[07:01:18] <MootPoot> yeah, there we go 
[07:01:54] <MootPoot> I dont pretend like I'm completely uninfluencable - its the nature of human society to be influenced by things around you
[07:02:10] <MootPoot> but I very much contest the "I'm a conservative talking head" view you have of me
[07:03:08] <Sapphirus> No, what I was saying there, was more like you were talking out of both sides.
[07:03:41] <Sapphirus> I'm aware that you lean quite left and the views expressed yesterday seem entirely disconnected from your political leanings.
[07:04:18] <Sapphirus> They wouldn't even be cogent if they were said by a conservative.
[07:05:36] <MootPoot> My views are all over the place though ( if you use today's north american specturm )
[07:05:49] <MootPoot> quite left is a bad descriptor
[07:06:08] <Sapphirus> That's just the rough gauge I've gotten -- that's all. Feel free to correct me on that one.

[13:58:19] <MootPoot> I better get this damn job
[13:58:31] <MootPoot> I completed all the work and did the extra task
[13:59:28] <Sadale> good luck MootPoot :3
[13:59:42] <MootPoot> now I just have to host it
[13:59:43] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'm actually sad to see one has to get that far to land on a job.
[14:00:10] <Sadale> If it's like technical test of an hour or two, I'm fine with that. But you're talking about hours of work for that. wow.
[14:00:12] <MootPoot> The only reason it took so long was becasue I was rusty, this should have taken like 3h or so tops
[14:00:32] <MootPoot> I personally treated it as a combined thing - refresher + job test
[14:01:06] <Sadale> Honestly I've no idea on how it'd work for people who're already in the workforce. For the unemployed tho it works because you guys have got the time to complete the tasks.
[14:01:27] <MootPoot> presumably you wouldn't be rusty 
[14:01:44] <MootPoot> but also if you're in the workforce already you usually dont need to do any tests if you've worked for a few companies
[14:01:48] <MootPoot> just say "no" lol
[14:01:54] <MootPoot> problem is I have something to prove
[14:04:28] <Sadale> Yeah. If you've got the work experience they probably won't ask you to complete a 3h test.
[14:04:56] <Sadale> If you don't mind me to ask, what did you do for the teest?
[14:05:13] <Sadale> You said that you have to host it. So, a website?

[16:47:03] <Sadale> The funny thing is that internet seems to be working fine, except that IRC got disconnected from time to time. I'm trying to figure out why :/

[20:35:30] <Bco1981> bluestack works fine on windows... well looks like it, the kids use it no problem.
[20:35:52] <isekaijin> Yes, actually, this is the only reason why I'm considering buying a Windows license.
[20:36:06] <Bco1981> you don't need a license for that
[20:36:09] <Bco1981> windows is free

[20:36:15] <isekaijin> What?
[20:36:33] <Bco1981> the only reason you need a license is if you want to change your background
[20:36:44] <isekaijin> Maybe you don't need to buy a Windows license when you buy a new computer, but that's because the cost of the license has been bundled with your computer.
[20:36:46] <Bco1981> and remove the "windows is not activated"
[20:37:01] <Bco1981> no, windows is free to use
[20:37:20] <isekaijin> Oh, so you mean “just pirate Windows”.

[23:35:40] <blackpill0w> and who decided that a desktop filled with icons is a good idea
[23:35:51] <blackpill0w> I find it a very bad idea
[23:35:59] <sentionics> this is why we have shit loads of UX tutorials on youtube
[23:36:15] <isekaijin> I blame webshits.

[23:38:14] <isekaijin> Everything that has been done to “democratize” programming, making it more “accessible” to people with no actual understanding of CS... everything has been a disaster for end user usability.
