[05:20:14] <atw> "[Go] cannot compile code at compile time. But I got thinking about the features that Go supports and realized that actually no, that is not correct. Go supports downloading packages from the internet from arbitrary sources and you can create a server that will generate code for you depending on the URL that is requested. So you actually are able to dynamically generate code." amazing!

I think a lot of that comes with practice but it's interesting to think about how people even figure that stuff out
[08:46:40] <rtpg> like once you get it it's kind of easy to try and fit the lines of text-shaped peg into the dictionary-keyed-by-group-sized hole, but it definitely doesn't seem immediate

[17:52:16] <amirouche> I dream to go to place like that, but I feat to go back to my daily misery..
[17:52:24] <shapr> amirouche: so apply now
[17:52:25] <amirouche> s/feat/fear/
[17:53:01] <shapr> I'd say 40% of the RC participants are from outside the USA
[17:53:09] <amirouche> I think it will make matters worse regarding my daily job.
[17:53:10] <pushcx> I was just talking with a friend yesterday who was talking about how they couldn't imagine joining a private social club like a country club, SoHo House, etc. I pointed out that we met through RC and the point was to spend time with other like-minded people who'd self-select into the group. If a local club seemed utterly alien and worthless, it's working.
[17:53:11] <shapr> some batches it's more like 60%
[17:53:23] <shapr> amirouche: I think you'd enjoy it

[17:54:23] <shapr> epilys: RC?
[17:54:26] <shapr> it's better without a job
[17:54:26] <epilys> yee

[17:54:36] <shapr> nope

[17:54:55] <shapr> Recurse Center is free, but you pay your own living situation
[17:55:03] <epilys> can't afford that :/
[17:55:26] <shapr> epilys: are you affording your living situation without a job right now?
[17:55:37] <pushcx> There's previously been some grants for under-represented minorities, but I don't know the current state of them and NYC is pretty expensive regardless.
[17:55:47] <epilys> I meant on-site, not the online plague version
[17:56:00] <shapr> oh
[17:56:01] <shapr> I like both
[17:56:20] <epilys> i'll check it out regardless :)
[17:56:24] <shapr> I saved up a pile of money, quit my job, was convinced to apply to RC
[17:56:28] <shapr> and then did two batches
[17:56:32] <shapr> six months at RC
[17:56:58] <shapr> First batch I was social butterfly, attending meetings, organizing meetings, giving presentations and classes
[17:57:06] <shapr> second batch I wrote code the whole time
[17:57:18] <pushcx> I saved money, got fired from a terrible job, was persuaded on Lobsters to visit RC, became admin of Lobsters while at RC. The two are pretty connected in my head.

[17:58:46] <wink> pushcx: I have no first-hand experience but from what I heard I dunno if the "private social club" thing is a good analogy

[19:54:30] <epilys> shapr, I don't use syntax highlighting (is that what it's for?) so I haven't looked into it
[19:54:52] <epilys> also I use ctags instead of LSPs :D
[19:55:12] <epilys> change is hard
[19:55:14] <mockturtle> An Interactive Guide to Keyframe Animations [css] (soulcutter) https://lobste.rs/s/2syojb
[19:55:25] <shapr> yeah, change is very hard, that's why I push myself to try new things so often
[19:55:36] <shapr> I like to think change is easier if I practice changing
[19:55:54] <shapr> so I've been using lsp stuff the past year
[19:56:02] <epilys> is it worth it you find?
[19:56:06] <shapr> mostly?
[19:56:24] <shapr> like, it's 75% good?
[19:56:34] <shapr> I switched to emacs from vim in 1999
[19:56:36] <epilys> for completion?
[19:56:42] <technomancy> it varies wildly depending on language, doesn't it?
[19:56:44] <shapr> lsp is good for many things
[19:56:50] <shapr> technomancy: yes, the Haskell support is really amazing
[19:57:29] <shapr> I tried rust_analyzer, which has great reviews, but I didn't see it doing much, maybe I messed up the config
[19:57:46] <shapr> also, I don't know any rust, I'm a total n00b
[19:57:56] <shapr> so maybe it does amazing things for experienced rust devs, and I wouldn't know
[19:58:04] <shapr> technomancy: any lsp support you really like?
[19:58:11] <shapr> epilys: what languages do you write most days?
[19:58:33] <technomancy> shapr: never used it once
[19:58:46] * shapr looks for fennel lsp clients
[19:58:49] <epilys> shapr, rust but now I started a link aggregator project in python so temporarily I have python as well
[19:59:22] <shapr> I haven't tried the python lsp, but I did write a few decades of python, could be fun to try.
[19:59:35] <epilys> in rust whenever I needed to see signatures, traits, docs etc I jumped to the source directly from vim
[19:59:42] <epilys> with exuberantctags
[19:59:57] <shapr> In Haskell, the signatures pop up when you mouse over the code.
[20:00:05] <shapr> and there's also jump to definition
[20:00:34] <epilys> sounds useful
[20:00:46] <shapr> The Haskell LSP client has a plugin that's half an automated theorem prover, so you can inductively build functions from a type signature
[20:00:49] <epilys> I don't personally use the mouse in terminals but I can see how it helps
[20:01:10] <shapr> yeah, I use the keyboard as well, same popups when I move the cursor
[20:01:32] <shapr> and I can fire actions like "minimize imports" "jump to type error" that kind of thing
[20:01:42] <technomancy> it seems like since LSP is so forcefully focused on static analysis it would be a lot harder to get something useful for it in python
[20:01:53] <epilys> shapr, hole-oriented programming :D

[20:04:38] <mockturtle> [ hlsexamples/Examples.hs at main · shapr/hlsexamples ] - github.com
[20:04:45] <shapr> but it needs updating since the plugin does way more things now
[20:05:50] <shapr> epilys: I guess? If you have a type signature the tactics / wingman plugin lets you cut off different parts
[20:06:03] <shapr> like, you can match on cases of the input type
[20:07:16] <epilys> I loved that stuff in uni, I wish I could find a job in PL research :(

[22:58:49] <companion_cube> so it's an ok one I guess
[22:59:18] <bkero> Except for all the input lag issues
[22:59:36] <bkero> Hard to determine if that's all their features or the framework itself
[23:00:30] *** Joins: Logan (~Logan@user/logan)
[23:02:03] <mjgardner> Can’t stand laggy editors
[23:02:40] <bkero> Neither can I
[23:02:53] <bkero> even vim can be laggy if you load it down with enough language servers and Syntastic checks
[23:03:17] <bkero> Well, laggy on write-out much more often than actual typing input lag, although I imagine it's possible there too.
[23:03:36] <dsc_> i currently have opened: 1 instance of GoLand, 3 instances of Pycharm, 2 instances of CLion :P
[23:03:51] <ario> my vscode has been laggy recently
[23:04:06] <ario> so frustrating
[23:04:36] <mjgardner> Never had problems with BBEdit
[23:04:43] <dsc_> vscode uses ... Electron :D
[23:05:24] <technomancy> mjgardner: ed doesn't waste space on my timex sinclair
[23:05:53] <ario> dsc_: yeah it does, and it's  ...not the greatest
[23:05:55] <mjgardner> That’s because ed is the Standard Editor.
[23:06:14] <ario> but i really enjoy the javascript debugger in it
[23:07:14] *** Quits: Maker (~maker@70.18.215.45) ()
[23:07:31] <ario> i've always wondered if i could get a breakpoint based debugger in vim or something :P
[23:07:49] <companion_cube> maybe with DAP

[23:09:17] <technomancy> DAP cracks me up; is like "oh shit, we made LSP but we realized we left out all the important features"

[23:11:05] <technomancy> but the fact that LSP can't run *any* code
[23:11:35] <companion_cube> so?
[23:11:48] <companion_cube> it's a tool to write code, not run code
[23:11:50] <technomancy> so it's kinda useless
[23:11:55] <technomancy> for some languages
[23:12:03] <companion_cube> and there's the caveat

[23:12:10] <companion_cube> yeah
[23:12:15] <companion_cube> but DAP is useless for some languages too
[23:12:15] *** Joins: raph_ael (~raphael@user/raph-ael/x-7806685)
[23:12:18] <companion_cube> just not the same ones
[23:12:36] <technomancy> so much for a universal tool
[23:13:04] <companion_cube> It's a good tool for typed languages
[23:13:12] <gerikson> pls expand DAP, it's massively overloaded as a search term :P
[23:13:20] <companion_cube> Debugger adapter protocol
[23:13:41] <gerikson> huh, new to me
[23:13:50] <gerikson> so basically LSPs for debuggers?
[23:13:57] <companion_cube> Pretty much
[23:14:02] <gerikson> cool
[23:14:14] <technomancy> it does repl type stuff too right?
[23:14:58] <technomancy> I mean, the idea that the compiler and the repl are separate tools is pretty sus from the outset

[23:24:13] <ben> then you could update them without editing the servicefile
[23:24:24] <JordiGH> Okay, so I gotta rewrite the thing either way.
[23:24:25] <JordiGH> alright.
[23:24:35] <ben> i can't think of any other way to do that
[23:24:38] <technomancy> env vars as config kinda just won, huh =(
[23:24:44] <ben> yeah :(
[23:24:49] <c355e3b> JordiGH: You can add a systemd override file to modify the service
[23:24:56] <ben> oh yeah that too
[23:25:03] <dsc_> (gdb) attach process_id
[23:25:03] <dsc_> (gdb) call putenv ("CELERYD_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG")
[23:25:04] <dsc_> (gdb) detach

[23:49:08] <Helmholtz> Is there an API for lobste.rs ?
[23:49:10] <Helmholtz> Like I want to get notified when someone replies me
[23:49:24] <cot> You should be getting an email when that happens
[23:49:32] <cot> Check your profile settings and ensure that it's not disabled
[23:50:41] <cot> Lobsters does have an API, but it's mostly simple stuff (listing comments for a story, listing stories, etc) rather than user-specific things that would require authentication (like what you're describing)
