[02:54:23] <gerikson> wat's EDA in this context?
[02:54:49] <drakonis> electronic design automation i think?
[02:55:14] <gerikson> ah ok
[02:55:29] <gerikson> this industry is suffering from TMA
[02:55:35] <gerikson> Too Many Acronyms
[02:55:46] <iDrougge> > If I try to add "foo" to "bar" Tcl will produce an exception because it can't parse "foo" nor "bar" as numbers.
[02:55:58] <iDrougge> That's just too sensible.
[02:56:00] <demize> Especially TMT.  Too many TLAs.

[16:41:11] <shapr> mostly, yes
[16:41:23] <jj5> I tried switching to dvorak once, but it was impossible, too much muscle memory for qwerty
[16:41:29] <shapr> aoeu
[16:41:49] <shapr> I use dvorak and I enjoy doing minor modifications every month or two

[16:46:26] <jj5> okay, so current file
[16:46:27] <jj5> not altogether different to what smart phones do
[16:47:14] <shapr> It doesn't change as you type, you have to explicitly update the frequencies with a new document
[16:47:25] <shapr> changing as you type would be especially funny
[16:47:36] <shapr> Well, the layout changes every time you press a key

[16:48:22] <jj5> shapr: lol, this is a fun idea, but I suspect a usability nightmare :P
[16:49:13] <shapr> It's funny, people keep coming up with ways to use it on a daily basis
[16:49:13] <Brekkjern> This is almost as good as that "use the laptop lid to send morse" project that someone made.
[16:49:44] <shapr> friend of mine pointed out that having a unique keymap for each letter of the alphabet probably did not give much benefit
[16:49:58] <shapr> and that I could likely merge multiple keymaps with the same "benefit score" to make memorization easier
[16:50:43] <shapr> and he suggested how to calculate benefit score, but sum of sum of distance to next expected keys
[16:51:24] <shapr> for example, if one keymap moves F to the right of the 'home' key, and another moves it to the left, the total score is the same for both keymaps
[16:51:35] <shapr> so you could merge them without any overall change
[16:52:06] <shapr> I also had someone ask me to add support for French keyboard layout

[20:06:35] <bsandro> word on street is that macos 12.3 replaced stock nano with pico, anyone can confirm?
[20:07:30] <iDrougge> It says "UW Pico" here.
[20:07:41] <iDrougge> If I type "pico".
[20:08:08] <iDrougge> But I have always typed "pico" since I used Pine a lot back in the day.
[20:08:36] <iDrougge> "nano" gives the same result â€” "UW Pico".
[20:15:09] <gwozniak> Okay, it seems debug sections are not order sensitive.  I can't find anything in the specs or related info that says they would be (everything is done with offsets to the start of the section).  I've diagnosed the issue I'm looking at and section order isn't the problem

[23:56:41] <gerikson> possibly it's public on their profile, I duno
