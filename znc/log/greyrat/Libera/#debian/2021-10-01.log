[03:19:37] <rk4> before i go elbow deep in...when it comes to writing nftable rules, does one think of wireguard interfaces the same way you think of say, eth0? [only difference i can think of is that on the physical interface that the wg0 packets are coming in on there should be a rule to allow wg traffic]
[03:21:12] <rk4> i'll be relatively easy for me to come up with a networking setup that works, but also relatively easy to accidently have a hole into the network that you could drive a bus through :\

[06:49:45] <PMT> If a bug against www.debian.org was marked fixed in git and the bug archived so I can't reply saying "actually it's still broken on live debian.org", it's not unreasonable to go open a new bug, right?

[08:08:16] <PMT> I can't.
[08:08:17] <PMT> It's archived.
[08:08:26] <somiaj> also don't open a new bug, you can just reopen the old bug (which I think would be the correct path if the bug still exists)
[08:08:36] <somiaj> you can't unarchive it?
[08:08:54] <somiaj> anyways, maybe send a comment to the mailing list just asking when you should expect a push?

[13:49:33] <willow> fwiw the oracle jdk seems to work better with intellij and android studio
[13:49:51] <tjcarter> That's an irony and a half
[13:49:58] <Hylden> willow++
[13:50:24] <willow> actually the other way around: intellij and android studio work better with oracle jdk
[13:50:50] <willow> that may have changed recent but was true not long ago
[13:51:37] <tjcarter> "We're suing Google because they've basically changed stuff and been popular and now we're not relevant!!!" "But um, your JDK is the one that works with their crap." "Yeah but um we still claim we can OWN function prototypes!!!"
[13:52:17] <tjcarter> Oracle should have been declared a pariah to the entire open source world and mercilessly ejected from EVERYTHING for that abomination of a claim.
[13:52:49] <willow> fwiw i think the decision only has to do with intellij not google.
[13:52:58] <tjcarter> IMO they don't GET a voice in anything Linux after that. But … I don't make these decisions. Apparently other large, stupid corporations do. 😉

[13:54:29] <willow> i don't know when i was a student studying java and android i kind of had sympathy for oracle.  google really hacked java in an underhanded sort of way rather than contributing above the board to java.   seems like they had a thing against oracle from the outset.

[13:55:27] <tjcarter> willow: I didn't say Google's hands were clean, they're google. They modified their three word motto basically by deleting the word "don't".
[13:56:00] <Hylden> willow: the .deb isn't registering in udate-java-alternatives
[13:56:02] <willow> android could have been an above-the-board enhancement to existing java which would have benefitted everyone
[13:56:21] <willow> Hylden: then just manually add it to the alternative for java
[13:56:41] <Hylden> :(
[13:56:44] <tjcarter> But they took an open stadnard, created by Sun and released for the benefit of all, and claimed they had the exclusive ownership of any function prototypes that implemented that standard.
[13:56:49] <Bushdog> Oracle is RDBMS am I right dude, am I right?
[13:57:27] <tjcarter> That's like saying that AT&T owns every implementation of the C compiler because stdio.h doesn't really change no matter who writes it.
[13:58:21] <tjcarter> That's SCO levels of threatening literally everyone and everything.

[17:26:35] <PMT> Though I've not tried actual cross-compiling (versus building under qemu-static) in a while, so I don't know how well mixing them works.
[17:28:23] <jantje> is 'native' building (using qemu-static) recommended over cross-compiling?

[17:29:42] <PMT> I believe actual Debian packaging requires real native building (e.g. not qemu) unless you have a really good reason for an exception. IME using qemu-static with a chroot is very simple, but also markedly slower than running native code would be, for obvious reasons.

[17:48:49] <jim> I would use either rsync (kinda hard to get working) or cp -a (easy) to do the copy
[17:49:16] <jim> oh, you first have to move /
[17:49:36] <jim> and you need a third partition to do that
[17:52:04] <jim> zitter, can you run: fdisk -l /dev/sda and pastebin that output?
[17:52:12] <zitter> what if I create a "fake" partition that after I will rename "home"?
[17:52:41] <jim> I dunno what you mean by fake
[17:53:06] <zitter> for example /home2 > delete partition > rename it /home
[17:53:10] <somiaj> zitter: since /home is not a vital system, what you can do is umount /home, and then mount it somewhere else like /mnt, then just copy /mnt to /home and since it is unmounted it will be coppied to the /home on your root partition (/dev/sda)
[17:53:27] <somiaj> after the copy you can do with the other partition what you want (just make sure to remove it from /etc/fstab)
[17:53:39] <somiaj> and here I'm assuming you meant you are copying the contents of /home onto the root partition /dev/sda2

[18:13:03] <somiaj> still to me it is easier to do this than reinstall, but it really depends on what you are familar with

[18:30:56] <somiaj> afiak all systemd systems do, systemd just automatically turns fstab into mount units

[21:05:34] <Khepra> in other words, you can use "ssh somehost" in both environments, but in one "somehost" is actually   Hostname host-01.yourdomain.tld     and in the otehr,   Hostname   host-02.yourdomain.tld
[21:05:41] *** Joins: mooff (~mooff@awful.cooking)
[21:05:56] <Khepra> but maybe that's not what you're after, your question is not really clear, so please explain.

[21:07:58] <redbrass> Khepra: You have describe exactly how we are set up.  The VM in this case is based off of a .qcow2 drive image.  THAT image is identical on the dev and production boxes.  The script that launches the VM is the only point where I can determine which environment I'm in.
[21:09:10] <redbrass> So the .ssh/config file is part of the VM, so is more or less set in stone when the VM starts.
[21:09:21] *** Quits: mooff (~mooff@awful.cooking) (Client Quit)
[21:09:55] <redbrass> Short of mounting the qcow2 file and altering the contents of the config file, I am not seeing a simple/easy way to handle a dynamic HostName entry.
[21:10:43] *** Joins: brachamh_ (~brachamh@user/brachamh)
[21:11:39] <Khepra> redbrass: what hostname? you should really post an example in a pastebin. are you ssh-ing into the VM, so you need to vary the hostname you're using to connect? are you talking about VM's internal /etc/hostname? something else?

[21:12:02] *** Quits: brachamh (~brachamh@user/brachamh) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[21:13:05] <redbrass> My Use Case.  We have a process that must be run inside a virtual machine.  This process generates USB installer disk images.  The generated images are copied to a "library" folder on a remote host.  Part of the process must also read from the library to help determine what already exists or needs to be built (kernels, for instance).
[21:14:23] *** Joins: Clarth (~Clarth@68.235.36.108)
[21:14:42] <redbrass> So our process does a bunch of "ssh library remote_command" type commands, as well as a few "scp local_resource library:/path"  (or the other way even - "scp library:/path local_resource".
[21:15:05] *** brachamh_ is now known as brachamh
[21:15:47] <Khepra> redbrass: so you need "library" to resolve to different IP, depending whether the VM is started in "production" or "development" environment?
[21:15:50] <redbrass> We make use of the .ssh/config file to remove the connection information from our process - it is extraneous noise inside the process, but necessary for the connection to work.
[21:16:01] <redbrass> Khepra: yes
[21:16:21] <Khepra> cloud init, define "library" in /etc/hosts

[21:16:54] <Khepra> or not even cloud init is needed, you can use any automation that would somehow know whether the VM is launched from prod or dev, and then set appropriate value into VM's /etc/hosts

[21:17:46] *** Joins: mooff (~mooff@awful.cooking)
[21:18:16] <redbrass> That is the fun.  If I am modifying the /etc/hosts file inside the VM, I could just modify the .ssh/config file instead.
[21:19:04] *** Quits: Clarth (~Clarth@68.235.36.108) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[21:19:13] <redbrass> regardless, it seems that mounting the qcow2 file, modifying a file, unmounting, then launching the VM is probably the most robust method.  I do like the idea of using the /etc/hosts though.
[21:19:40] *** Joins: craigevil (craig@user/craigevil)
[21:19:51] <Khepra> well sure you can alter anything, not necessarily just /etc/hosts.
[21:20:25] <Khepra> alternatively you can inject values into the VM via qemu params if you use an external kernel, if that works for your use case. otherwise, if you need immutable qcow, you can really use cloud init
[21:20:39] *** Joins: Clarth (~Clarth@23.226.133.76)
[21:20:42] <redbrass> That may not always work though - I may need different port or username to connect to the dev box (local to the developer's workstation, but not necessarily identical paths/credentials).
[21:20:44] <Khepra> cloud init can contact a statically defined server on boot and set whatever definition
[21:21:07] *** Quits: p0indexter (~alpha@user/p0indexter) (Quit: ars longa vita brevis)
[21:21:28] <Khepra> alternatively, DNS.... split brain... thingy... oh whatsitcalled when an authoritative DNS server is configured to give different answers depending on where the query came from.... uhhh.... it's at the tip of my tongue....
[21:21:42] <redbrass> I don't seem to have a cloud command on my dev box.  We are not dealing with cloud servers here - local infrastructure.
[21:22:00] <Khepra> cloud init is a package you can install into your VM
[21:22:13] <Khepra> ,i cloud-init
[21:22:14] <judd> Package cloud-init (admin, optional) in bullseye/amd64: initialization system for infrastructure cloud instances. Version: 20.4.1-2; Size: 485.0k; Installed: 2187k; Homepage: https://launchpad.net/cloud-init
[21:22:23] <redbrass> I'll investigate.  Thanks.
[21:22:35] <Khepra> it's actually used by "clouds" to dynamically set stuff on otherwise immutable static images the VMs launch from
[21:22:49] <jim> ,find bin/cloud
[21:22:51] <judd> No packages in bullseye/amd64 were found with that file.
[21:23:06] <Khepra> you can also ghetto it with a curl or wget and an external server returning different answers between prod and dev environments

[21:47:30] <redbrass> Khepra: I just talked through the problem with our team and have come up with an "easier" solution.  We launch the VM and then use SSH to run a remote command inside the VM.  We can just add one step into that - lauch the vm, scp the environemnt details, run the remote script.  Then a slight change to our process inside the VM to handle the environment setup.

[21:48:43] <somiaj> have you looked into tools like ansimble/puppet that I think have this problem solved?
[21:49:19] <redbrass> That last step would basically overwrite the .ssh/config file for us.  In this way each developer can run things locally with their own configuration, without impacting production.  Just means we need an environment config file that does not get checked into our repository.  That is a common technique though.

Then find ways to automatically use our existing ansible scripts to validate the generated output.  I'm sure I'll want to refactor the build process as I get more familiar with Ansible.
