[00:56:57] <blkshp> This time, possibly, i should be back by now.
[00:57:08] <blkshp> Old silly Christmas eve tradition!
[00:57:23] <blkshp> We meet for gift swapping and have McDonalds.
[00:57:50] <GuiToris> isn't there a British equivalent of McDonalds?
[00:58:13] <blkshp> Yes, it's McDonalds.

[01:00:01] <GuiToris> I came here because I messed up something again... I was trying cooking pumpkin pie, what is the crust of a pie called?
[01:00:12] <GuiToris> I thought it was pasta, but they laughed at me
[01:00:25] <GuiToris> they said pasta is like dough
[01:00:30] <GuiToris> same difference!
[01:00:37] <blkshp> PAstry dough
[01:00:53] <blkshp> Pasta dough is different but they both refer to the uncooked mixtures
[01:01:38] <GuiToris> yes, I'm not much of a cook, they have been all the same to me
[01:01:46] <GuiToris> thank you
[01:01:56] <blkshp> Well they'll turn out quite differently.
[01:02:01] * blkshp ... pastry chef!
[01:02:24] <GuiToris> umm, both products will be eaten by me
[01:02:58] <blkshp> YEs but if you put pasta dough in a pie crust and fill it, it will not cook and will be repugnant.
[01:03:56] <GuiToris> what is this word, why haven't I known about it?! :D
[01:03:56] <bin_shoppin> oh god that sounds horrific
[01:04:53] <GuiToris> my girl used to warn me to mix the eggs much more evenly otherwise they'll be scrambled eggs in the muffin
[01:05:43] <placeb0> my girl used to ask me to buy muffins
[01:05:55] <placeb0> she knew
[01:05:57] <bin_shoppin> GuiToris: yep very true
[01:10:09] <blkshp> What, repugnant, great word :D
[01:10:49] <blkshp> Don't over mix your mixture. Especially with pastry.
[01:11:49] <placeb0> don't overbake it too 
[01:12:08] <placeb0> it will take very long to get rid of the smell of burn
[01:12:10] <GuiToris> I tend to overeat, especially at Christmastime
[01:12:35] <blkshp> Make a lemon drizzle.
[01:12:41] <blkshp> Add icing to the top.
[01:12:47] <blkshp> That's my addition to the recipe :D
[01:13:50] <GuiToris> blkshp, are you still talking about pumpkin pie, I thought it was an American pie
[01:14:14] <blkshp> "lemon Drizzle" is a cake
[01:15:17] <GuiToris> ok, I thought you were suggesting that I should add lemon to the mixture
[01:16:01] <placeb0> blkshp: I guess you picked up a new hobby during quarantine
[01:16:17] <GuiToris> I usually just buy frozen stuff, and just throw them into the oven
[01:16:40] <blkshp> placeb0: :D
[01:16:45] <GuiToris> placeb0, his new hobby is mocking poor non native speakers
[01:16:56] <blkshp> I think you do add lemon to the mixture
[01:16:57] <GuiToris> I was wrong, he's always done that
[01:17:03] <blkshp> (you add lemon to a lot of things) 
[01:17:08] <blkshp> Screw you hippy. xD
[01:17:09] <placeb0> GuiToris: is that new?
[01:17:16] <placeb0> he has always been doing that
[01:17:33] <GuiToris> blkshp, I always add lemon to lemonades
[01:18:05] <placeb0> GuiToris: keep in mind you are taking advice from someone who likes coffee with toothpaste
[01:18:31] <TimMc> Ah, does blkshp use toothpaste as coffee creamer?

[01:19:03] <TimMc> *tea creamer
[01:19:05] <blkshp> Ignore placeb0 he's just insane
[01:19:10] <blkshp> There is no creamer

[16:24:19] <Me-me> m1dnight: Hmm. I can only think of more verbose ways. I thought that was the point of academic writing :P
[16:24:34] <Me-me> Let me think - "lowered production costs"?
[16:26:17] <Me-me> "Decrease" instead of "reduction"?
[16:33:27] <LimeOn> mass production?
[16:34:04] <Me-me> Well that's a step further. That's stating the cause, notthe effect.
[16:34:39] <LimeOn> mass production means more of the item, and a decrease of the costs
[16:34:48] <LimeOn> Or at least is what i think
[16:35:19] <Me-me> It does, but I was trying not to change the communicated semantics.
