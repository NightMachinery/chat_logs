[20:54:13] *** Joins: Trieste (T@user/pilgrim)
[20:54:29] <biys> so here's the thing about CBC and the idea of climate change that seems to make my ears hurt.  climate change isn't measured as the amount of change that's happening ni the climate.  climate changed is measured by the effect the weather event has on humans
[20:54:57] <biys> for example.  a once a century storm will be summarized as "significant climate change" as a result of the negative effects it has on the people who experience it
[20:55:16] <biys> it isn't a matter of the discussion about how frequently certain storms of certain magnitudes happens
[20:55:24] <biys> it's about the effects the storms have on the population
[20:56:03] <biys> for example.  fraser valley BC
[20:56:04] <learner36> yeah, that seems to be a one-off reactive view of climate change
[20:56:09] <biys> that was at one time fraser lake
[20:56:14] <biys> it was pumped out at the beginning of the 20th century
[20:56:34] <biys> so now, as a result of a 100 year sorm, fraser valley is attempting to return to fraser lake
[20:57:00] <biys> it's all over CBC radio as "CLIMATE CHANGE#!@#%!$^&!$%"
[20:57:14] <biys> and it's like "naw, you idiots are just stupid and populated people at the bottom of what was a lake"
[20:57:31] <biys> i'm surprised the canadian aboriginals aren't demanding the land be turned back to it's original condition
[20:57:38] <learner36> yeah, I don't know, I'm not sure whether that is direct evidence of climate change or whether it's just a 1-in-100 year storm, maybe both?
[20:57:39] <biys> given the amount of displacement that happened
[20:57:50] <biys> learner36: i'm not attempting to say cliamte change doesn't exist
[20:57:57] <learner36> yeah, me neither
[20:58:06] <biys> i'm not attempting to say that anthropogenic climate change doesn't exist
[20:58:27] <biys> i'm saying that fraser valley is not a result of climate change
[20:58:31] <learner36> for sure, it's just a strange way to use a 1-in-100 year storm, as a single piece of evidence for it
[20:58:33] <biys> i'm saying it's a result of poor planning and nature
[20:58:38] <learner36> whereas, you need to look at the whole basket of storms
[20:58:41] <learner36> the evolution of the system
[20:58:58] <learner36> oh, for sure
[20:59:14] <learner36> if you build in the flood plane, etc.
[20:59:26] <learner36> *plain
[20:59:52] <biys> but from what i've seen it seems to be common
[21:00:01] <biys> even the deep freeze texas had last summer
[21:00:15] <biys> that ruined a bunch of infastructure and cost millions in damage
[21:00:28] <biys> that isn't a result of climate change.  that is a result of poor infastructure development
[21:00:33] <biys> poor building codes
[21:00:36] <biys> poor planning
[21:00:39] <learner36> yeah, flood insurance is another thing altogether, I think there are certain companies that provide it in Canada, but maybe some conversation about how it's defined
[21:00:49] <learner36> overland versus sewer back up, etc.
[21:01:01] <biys> learner36: well i think about a decade and a half back there was a big flood that happened in the rockies near calgary
[21:01:11] *** Quits: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com) ()
[21:01:14] <biys> adn iirc there was huge fights about if those properties will ever get flood insurance again
[21:01:22] <biys> cause they know that lake will flood again
[21:01:26] <biys> it isn't a matter of is, it's a matter of when
[21:01:36] <biys> :s/is/if/
[21:02:09] <biys> thing about fraser valley is, they'ev had reports about the likelihood of a significant enough storm causing the type of damage that happened for over a decade
[21:02:19] <learner36> yeah, who would want to insure them? there's no mechanism for facility flood insurance in Canada
[21:02:28] <biys> i think it's around 2 decades now when they started doing environmental analysis on sustainability
[21:03:02] <learner36> in the US I believe there are some government options for flood insurance
[21:03:11] <biys> i've lived in THIS city long enough to know that there are now houses built on an area that was once swamp
[21:03:12] <learner36> National Flood Insurance Program, etc.
[21:03:43] <biys> i remember when all the land on the suothwest was bird habitat
[21:03:44] <biys> and swamp
[21:03:53] <biys> now it's houses and condos
[21:04:00] <biys> the basements will crack
[21:04:07] <biys> they'll have structural issues
[21:04:16] <learner36> yeah, I think that is probably not a safe place to build
[21:04:17] <biys> gumbo
[21:04:26] <learner36> some of this stuff has to be addressed at the construction level
[21:04:34] <learner36> like don't build in risky zones
[21:04:50] <learner36> and the creation of a facility flood insurance program could adversely lead to more risky construction
[21:04:52] <biys> there are mechanisms to make building in those areas better, more safe
[21:04:54] <biys> but it costs more
[21:05:08] <learner36> yeah, so regulation on that sort of thing would probably be helpful
[21:05:22] <biys> anyways
[21:05:24] <biys> my point is this
[21:05:27] <learner36> I wonder who's footing the bill if a giant building collapses, etc.
[21:05:38] <biys> this whole "climate change" narrative, as i see it, is kind of bullshit
[21:05:51] <biys> there's so much that is being clumped into "climate change" that has no right being clumped in
[21:05:59] <biys> we're simply making excuses for poor planning
[21:06:12] <biys> then summarizing every weather event that has a net negative effect on the population as "climate change"
[21:06:16] <learner36> in this case I would tend to agree, that this was a bad idea before climate change was even a thing
[21:06:48] <biys> our infastructuer should have been hardened years ago
[21:07:00] <biys> and i used "hardened" in the sense of... secured significantly
[21:07:08] <biys> like you harden a linux kernel
[21:07:22] <learner36> there was an 1894 fraser river flood
[21:07:58] <learner36> this is an interesting article although it's too long for me to read:
[21:07:59] <learner36> https://www.iclr.org/wp-content/uploads/PDFS/making-flood-insurable-for-canadian-homeowners.pdf
[21:08:10] <learner36> I think it's arguing for some sort of government-mandated insurance option
[21:08:22] <learner36> yeah

[21:11:36] <biys> it's typically used as structural support in stick (wood) buildings
[21:14:24] <learner36> yeah, I would need to look at what data we have on construction details of these sorts of buildings, but I don't think it's as specific as all that
[21:14:43] <learner36> it's more like construction class, and frame, stuff like that

[21:15:59] <biys> you know how hard i would be for a furnace manufacturer to put in a pressure differential sensor to tell you when to change your filter?
[21:16:10] <biys> instead...  we have a "rule of thumb" that you change it once a month
[21:16:18] <biys> that rule of thumb is nonsense
