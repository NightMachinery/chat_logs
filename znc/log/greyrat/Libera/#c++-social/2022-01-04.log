[01:13:02] <dukwon> i was meant to be working today; didn't
[01:13:15] <dukwon> i'll be travelling tomorrow (meant to be yesterday)
[01:13:52] <hinst> today I felt rather reluctant about writing work-related code; which is not a good sign... I was kinda hoping to feel more energetic after holidays
[01:16:20] <Faux> Uh oh.
[01:35:07] <hinst> Why do I have to feel some sort of internal struggle all the time? It is so annoying
[01:35:33] <hinst> fighting myself in my head for hours
[01:36:20] <BIRDSORTING> boredom
[01:36:27] <BIRDSORTING> if you had any real problems you wouldn't bother with it
[01:37:30] <hinst> I wish I was a little girl and there was like a strict step-father who made me do things all the time telling me "do this, do that". Then I would not have to force myself but rather delegate this role to someone else; it would be a great help I guess. Maybe not
[01:38:02] <BIRDSORTING> why a girl
[01:38:49] <BIRDSORTING> you could be a massive house nigger wearing jorts and in fear of MaNL's husky
[01:42:40] <hinst> But then I would not have to fear my stepfather. I dunno
[01:42:56] <hinst> Fear his wrath
[01:43:13] <BIRDSORTING> sounds like a sex dream
[01:43:17] <BIRDSORTING> more boredom
[01:46:44] <hinst> what is boredom?
[01:52:18] <BIRDSORTING> having time to worry about things other than starving or freezing to death

[15:25:55] <Crocodillian> people don't use docker anymore, they use podman, which is essentially the same thing but uses the Open Container system in linux
[15:26:11] <Crocodillian> 100% the same interface
[15:26:22] <Crocodillian> even some docker stuff uses OCI as a backend now
[15:26:28] <Crocodillian> but docker still works fine
[15:26:41] <Crocodillian> and like on windows or mac you'd use normal docker and it works fine
[15:27:06] <Crocodillian> yeah it's called Open Container Initiative
[15:27:14] <Crocodillian> basically all the container shit is in the kernel now
[15:27:36] <Crocodillian> and it's sometimes very very useful
[15:27:46] <Crocodillian> so you do yourself a disservice by not at least learning how to use it
[15:29:38] <Carbonflux> thats sounds like a good argument.
[15:30:56] <Crocodillian> I'll give you an example, I had to convert a php forum from an old version to a new one, but to do that I needed to run a very old php version, so I just ran it from docker in a couple minutes instead of spending hours trying to compile it
[15:31:14] <Carbonflux> makes me want to say something overly generalized and cynical that does not actually capture the proper context but can't be argued against because its too handwavy.
[15:31:33] <Crocodillian> yes I hate all the cloudshit as much as you do
[15:31:38] <Crocodillian> but it can be a useful tool
[15:32:06] <Crocodillian> another example, I can open a shell in most linux distros in literally seconds, if I want to test something in a different distro
[15:32:34] <Crocodillian> maybe a few minutes to set up a more specialized testing environment but whatever
[15:34:27] <Crocodillian> Carbonflux: I wrote a guide for my most common use-case: https://github.com/rkitover/docker-shell-guide
[15:35:19] <Carbonflux> :)
[15:37:27] <Crocodillian> think of it as a chroot
[15:37:35] <Crocodillian> people have been using these for a very long time
[15:37:37] <Crocodillian> or like bsd jails
[15:37:49] <Crocodillian> this is just a much improved and capable system for that
[15:38:16] <Carbonflux> you're a good writer.
[15:38:59] <Crocodillian> thank you
[15:39:17] <Crocodillian> I actually wanted to make a more generalized utility that does this stuff, haven't gotten around to it yet
[15:44:16] <Carbonflux> sometimes i think control of time is the ultimate power, but it comes back to the mind; there is a story in Buddhism, some monks are standing on a bridge over a river, one monk says "its the river that moves," another says "No, its the bridge that moves," but the third says, "You are both wrong, its the mind that moves..."
[15:45:05] <Carbonflux> i never agreed with the time-space link personally.
[15:45:26] <Carbonflux> i think time is perception.
[15:46:43] <Crocodillian> you could think of it as both time and space being perception
[15:46:45] <T`alZHeimeR> "The Vision EQXX is a lightweight car (1,750 kg or 3,858 lbs)" I like how americans thikn that a +1.7T car is a lightweight version
[15:47:03] <Crocodillian> have you heard of the observer effect in quantum mechanics
[15:47:22] <Crocodillian> or rather, time, space and objects being perception
[15:47:40] <Crocodillian> some physicists believe that information is the true nature of reality
[15:47:49] <Crocodillian> rather than matter and energy etc.
[15:48:05] <Carbonflux> yes, tho we are stuck with the Copenhagen interpretation as a formality.
[15:48:46] <Carbonflux> i think we need new theory of observation. 
[15:49:02] <Carbonflux> ya, i agree.
[15:49:17] <Carbonflux> tho maybe not information exactly.
[15:49:26] <Carbonflux> because that implies a cpu
[15:49:49] <Carbonflux> i think matter is both processor and code and data at once.
[15:50:11] <Carbonflux> so, its truly parallel.
[15:50:24] <Crocodillian> yeah the universe can't be a turing machine because turing machines are extremely limited
