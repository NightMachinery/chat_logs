[05:17:40] <evilgohan2> Capsule Corp to no longer sell capsules
[05:18:12] <evilgohan2> Stark Industries to cease weapons manufacturering and development
[05:19:16] <evilgohan2> Seriously, I actually _get_ what OnlyFans is thinking - because Payment processors are notoriously extremely puritanical. Blood and gore? Perfectly fine. Far right extremist content that pushes people to literally storm the capitol of the United States? A-ok. (I'm serious. That's not hyperbole.)
[05:19:27] <evilgohan2> But tits? Dicks? Sometimes both?
[05:19:32] <evilgohan2> That's a no no
[05:20:11] <evilgohan2> But at the same time, no "explicit"  porn? Softcore only? OnlyFans is going to have to _really_ justify what if offers over... well..
[05:20:12] <evilgohan2> Patreon.
[05:22:32] <evilgohan2> oh, nvm. Patreon banned sexual content for the same reason in 2018.
[05:22:36] <ThePendulum> evilgohan2: I wondered that too, don't think so, otherwise it seems pretty pointless. my name is in it and all the links are to paypal.com
[05:24:13] <evilgohan2> According to my Google Fu, PayPal stopped supporting OnlyFans as a payment processor quite some time ago -- apparently for the same reason.

[05:25:30] <ThePendulum> wonder how many of these payment providers take issue with gambling sites
[05:25:31] <imMute> nah, men just don't like women actually profiting for themselves.
[05:25:44] <ThePendulum> bit of a hot take
[05:26:11] <ThePendulum> payment providers have given traditional porn sites a load of shit as well
[05:26:18] <evilgohan2> Gambling? Perfectly fine as well.
[05:26:37] <ThePendulum> also you're not telling me men want women not to profit more than they want to profit themselves

[20:09:58] <skye0_mobile> idk what job I want to do at this point. i need something permanent. twitch is the only company i'm willing to sell myself out on and even that has some caveats

[20:30:07] <evilgohan2> Might as well jump the ladder and go to Amazon if you're going to whore yourself out
[20:30:10] <evilgohan2> (your words) :P
[20:30:17] <unfinity> ・゜゜ ​ ・。。・゜゜\_​o< QUAC​K!
[20:32:53] <skye0_mobile> eh, i'd rather not. that said i refuse to make money from youtube
[20:33:05] <skye0_mobile> they're really bad at hiding their greed
[20:33:40] <skye0_mobile> i hope the apocalypse comes for the US soon just because their neoliberal ideology is cancer
[20:34:56] <evilgohan2> Twitch is just as greedy
[20:35:20] <evilgohan2> There's no corporation out there that isn't, and any that claims they aren't is full of shit
[20:35:26] <skye0_mobile> i'm not as emotionally attached to twitch
[20:35:40] <skye0_mobile> yt i feel like i've been betrayed ever since the google acquisition
[20:37:04] <skye0_mobile> but yeah i want to work for a non-profit or something that doesn't hurt my conscience and that i enjoy
[20:42:15] <evilgohan2> I feel no emotional attachment to any company - particular one that I know would drop me first at the sign of anything remotely resembling a bad quarter
[20:43:56] <evilgohan2> With absolutely zero compunction
[20:44:09] <evilgohan2> I've seen people laid off the week before Thanksgiving and in the days before Christmas.
[20:44:38] <skye0_mobile> i've been recommended b-corps, which may be less bad, but i'm finding not much luck with positions so far
[20:44:41] <evilgohan2> I watched a quarter of the company I work for lose their jobs last year.
[20:44:47] <evilgohan2> Emotional attachment? Fuck that.
[20:45:08] <evilgohan2> Unless it's my company, or I have some stake in it, there's none.
[20:45:14] <skye0_mobile> i loved youtube - it was tumblr for me before that even became a thing
