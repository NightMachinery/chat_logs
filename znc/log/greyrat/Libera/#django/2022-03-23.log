[13:07:54] <CapnKernel> Sigh, I fear I'm sending myself a little crazy.
[13:08:32] <CapnKernel> I need to write a system (in Django naturally) that interoperates with an existing system in PHP.
[13:09:11] <CapnKernel> In particular, there should be single sign on.  Sign on in one system, no need to reauth in the other.
[13:09:34] <CapnKernel> For this I've been looking at OpenID Connect, aka OIDC, which is an authentication layer based on OAuth2
[13:10:06] <CapnKernel> The existing PHP system can be set up to authenticate via OIDC, so in theory that's not a problem
[13:11:06] <serafeim> CapnKernel: are both these system under the same domain ?
[13:11:13] <serafeim> i.e system1.foo.com and system2.foo.com ?
[13:11:37] <CapnKernel> If you've seen websites that say "sign on with Github/Facebook/Google/MadCowDisease", that's probably using OIDC.  Your app delegates responsibility for authentication to some other trusted party, and something is returned to you, signed, to identify the person who logged in
[13:11:45] <CapnKernel> serafeim: Yes, can be.
[13:12:03] <CapnKernel> I looked into using an external program to do the OIDC providing.  Keycloak looks very nice, although it's written in Java.
[13:12:19] <serafeim> CapnKernel: are these systems maybe served through the same web server ? (i.e a same nginx) ?
[13:12:52] <CapnKernel> Using django-allauth (which has support for Keycloak as an OIDC provider), I was able to authenticate my Django app against keycloak.  So far so good
[13:14:09] <CapnKernel> The other constraint is that I have to have this work with all the users of the existing customer.  That's ok, I can grab the user table from that system, with the password hashes, and implement a new password hasher in Keycloak.  So far so gooder.
[13:15:21] <CapnKernel> Things get complicated because I'm now in the situation where I have information about users in Keycloak, and information about users in the db that my Django code uses.  And the info I'm using has extra fields that the auth-only info in Keycloak doesn't.
[13:15:53] <CapnKernel> The keycloak folks say I should put this stuff in LDAP, but I feel that that's just going down one rabbit hole to get to the start of the next rabbit hole
[13:16:21] <CapnKernel> What I've been investigating is whether it's possible to have my Django system do the OIDC providing.  If this works, then my user info will be in just one place.
[13:16:50] <CapnKernel> I've been doing experiments with this: https://github.com/juanifioren/django-oidc-provider
[13:17:31] <CapnKernel> But that opens more cans that sadly, contain worms
[13:18:46] <CapnKernel> I'm using django-allauth for two purposes.  The first is to ditch Django's insistence on every User having a username, and replace it with something where every User has an email address.
[13:19:15] <CapnKernel> The second is as an OIDC client, so I can test out django-oidc-provider
[13:20:02] <CapnKernel> serafeim: I'm guessing that your question about being same domain is going to come down to whether or not I can set cookies that are scoped to a particular domain.
[13:20:04] <serafeim> CapnKernel: these thins are way tyoo complex.
[13:20:09] <serafeim> CapnKernel: correct
[13:20:18] <CapnKernel> Yes I can, but that's not how OIDC works
[13:20:37] <serafeim> CapnKernel: OIDC seems like a complex thing that you don't want to touch with a 10-foot pole.
[13:20:58] <serafeim> CapnKernel: also you didn't answer my question about the possibility of these apps being served by the same web server (nginx or apache)
[13:21:25] <CapnKernel> Same domain, but not same web server and/or VPS
[13:22:33] <serafeim> ok so that leaves out using the RemoteUserBackend https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/contrib/auth/#django.contrib.auth.backends.RemoteUserBackend
[13:22:50] <serafeim> so. my recommendation is to use the cookies.
[13:23:36] <serafeim> also if you don't need large session data you can even save all the session info in the cookie: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/http/sessions/#using-cookie-based-sessions
[13:23:41] <CapnKernel> Can you be more specific?
[13:23:53] <CapnKernel> I'm familiar with sessions in Django
[13:24:04] <CapnKernel> This tutorial worked for me: https://number1.co.za/using-keycloak-as-the-identity-provider-for-users-on-django-and-django-admin/
[13:25:02] <serafeim> you'll use the cookie-based-session to save *all* the session data in the cookie. you'll just set this setting: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/settings/#std:setting-SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN to save the cookie in the *parent* domain
[13:25:33] <serafeim> then from the php when the user logs in you'll read the django cookie from the parent domain and *decrypt* it using the same SECRET as with django
[13:25:41] <serafeim> that's it.
[13:26:14] <CapnKernel> Ok, I appreciate the suggestion
[13:26:14] <serafeim> the only problem with this is that you have a limit of like 4kb to the data you store in the session but this should be more than enough for most purposes
[13:26:57] <serafeim> this is the simplest possible solution that *works*. i am using it in one of my projects but instead of usingg the cookie saved session i read the cookie and have an API to get the user info from the other system
[13:27:00] <CapnKernel> Users still need to be able to log in through the PHP system, and I'm not able to make code changes to it.  What I'm able to do though, is have officially sanctioned modules installed, one of which is an OIDC client
[13:27:11] <CapnKernel> Yes that certainly works.
[13:27:24] <serafeim> CapnKernel: sorry then i can't help you with this

[13:30:35] <CapnKernel> Just wanted to know if there was anyone else here who had used OIDC for anything.
[13:31:22] <CapnKernel> For example it's not uncommon to use OIDC for authentication when serving REST APIs.
[13:32:59] <CapnKernel> And whether there was an OIDC provider which is a bit better supported than django-oidc-provider, which has been a bit unloved the past few years.
[13:34:05] <CapnKernel> And whether someone else had used django-allauth as the OIDC client to interface to an OIDC provider that wasn't one of the many oauth2 providers supported by django-allauth

[17:14:23] <serafeim> CapnKernel: yes but how can i override that for my users admin  ?
[17:16:20] <CapnKernel> Do you mean admin of your users, or admin for your users?  In other words, who will use this, you, or your users?
[17:19:23] <CapnKernel> In trying to guess what you mean, I'm doing all the work.  Please try to explain your situation with a bit more detail.  (Tip: If you're using the word "this" or "that", it depends on context, and your reader [me] may not understand what you mean)
[17:19:29] <CapnKernel> Try this: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display
[17:20:19] <CapnKernel> "There are four types of values that can be used in list_display".  Have a look at type 2: "A callable that accepts one argument, the model instance"

[17:50:52] <CapnKernel> Hope it works for you.
[17:51:21] <CapnKernel> Just letting you know that the solution I said will be inefficient, because there will be one extra db query for every user
[17:53:49] <CapnKernel> serafeim: The admin page code will do a query to find all the rows to put in the page.  It _may_ be possible to stop the callable being slow because of extra db lookups up by prefetching the information
[17:54:11] <CapnKernel> You could do this by overriding get_queryset: https://pyquestions.com/override-default-queryset-in-django-admin
[17:55:33] <CapnKernel> So you could call super().get_queryset() to get the original query, but then add .select_related() or prefetch_related() (I can never remember the difference).  That way the info the callable needs to generate the column will already be in the instance.
