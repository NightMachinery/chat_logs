[18:51:27] <fria> hello can some help me with this https://www.jdoodle.com/ia/piI
[18:52:15] <Chunky_Ks> fria: What's the question?
[18:52:53] *** Quits: l__q (~modinfo@user/modinfo) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[18:53:01] <fria> i need to get the students with grade not >= 2.00 in any subjects
[18:53:13] <Chunky_Ks> right. and what have you tried so far?
[18:54:08] <fria> select student.lname,student.fname,subject.name,grade.value from student,subject,grade where student.id=grade.student_id and subject.id=grade.subject_id;
[18:55:11] <Chunky_Ks> sure. slightly older syntax, hopefully your teacher isn't teaching you to do joins with that syntax, but ok.
[18:55:23] <Chunky_Ks> so now you need to add a clause to the WHERE, right?
[18:55:51] <Chunky_Ks> SELECT bunchastuff WHERE thing AND thing AND {be specific about grading}
[18:56:12] <fria> i cant make it to ouput harry and hermione
[18:57:01] <fria> the students that has no grade >= 2.00 in any subject
[18:57:37] <Chunky_Ks> ah. I see your question.
[18:58:00] <Chunky_Ks> has your class taught you common table expressions yet? or subqueries?
[18:58:04] <fria> i only know WHERE grade.value < 2.00
[18:58:40] <fria> i only self study 
[18:58:49] <Chunky_Ks> ok, cool
[18:59:25] <fria> i know a little about sub queries
[18:59:28] <Chunky_Ks> here's what you're going to do. step one, is to create a query that gives you a list of ids of students who *do* have at least one grade over 2.0
[18:59:53] <Chunky_Ks> then, you put that in a subquery like this:
[19:00:30] <Chunky_Ks> SELECT * FROM student WHERE id NOT IN (the subquery that lists everyone who *does* have a grade ov 2 or over)
[19:01:54] <Chunky_Ks> so, in your case, you're looking to creat e a subquery that returns one column, student_id, with one row in it, "2", indicating that Ron is the only one who scored a 2.0 or above
[19:02:56] <Chunky_Ks> while doing the development, you start by just building that subquery on it's own. You're already 98% of the way there, with what ou've shown
[19:03:19] <Chunky_Ks> the slap it in as a subquery then use it as a filter at the end
[19:04:17] <Chunky_Ks> to be clear, there are lots of ways to solve a problem like yours; a subquery with NOT IN is the simplest [and most obvious] to implement, although it's also usually the slowest in a real database.
[19:05:35] <fria> select lname,fname from student where id not in (select student.id from student,subject,grade where student.id=grade.student_id and subject.id=grade.subject_id and grade.value >= 2);
[19:05:43] <fria> is this correct
[19:05:47] <Chunky_Ks> yep. That's about what I'd do
[19:05:54] <Chunky_Ks> did it give you the result you wanted?
[19:06:09] <fria> it gave harry and hermione
[19:06:19] <fria> i will test it further
[19:06:23] <Chunky_Ks> perfect.
[19:06:36] <fria> thanks a lot
[19:06:41] <Chunky_Ks> since you're self-studying, let me also point you in one other direction
[19:06:57] <Chunky_Ks> the way you're doing joins is very old-school. Not wrong, but modern syntax is easier to read
[19:07:03] <fria> but is it good and fast
[19:07:10] <Chunky_Ks> yeah, it'll get the job done.
[19:07:33] <fria> oww is there a new way?
[19:07:57] <Chunky_Ks> currently, to joining tables, you do this: SELECT stuff FROM tblA, tblB, tblC WHERE tblA.stuff=tblB.stuff AND tblB.stuff=tblC.stuff 
[19:08:11] <Chunky_Ks> the modern syntax to do that same hting looks like this:
[19:09:40] <Chunky_Ks> select lname,fname from student where id not in (select student.id from student,subject,grade where student.id=grade.student_id and 
[19:09:43] <Chunky_Ks>               subject.id=grade.subject_id and grade.value >= 2);
[19:09:48] <Chunky_Ks> oop. wrong clipboard
[19:09:48] <Chunky_Ks> select student.id
[19:09:48] <Chunky_Ks>   from student
[19:09:48] <Chunky_Ks>    INNER JOIN grade ON student.id=grade.student_id
[19:09:48] <Chunky_Ks>    INNER JOIN subject ON subject.id=grade.subject_id 
[19:09:51] <Chunky_Ks>   WHERE grade.value >= 2
[19:10:32] <Chunky_Ks> when you use "INNER JOIN {thing} ON {clause}", it makes it much more obvious that those thing sare going together, rather than doing it in a WHERE clause later
[19:11:26] <fria> oh ok
[19:11:40] <fria> im going to study joins

[19:30:52] <Chunky_Ks> as I was in the other room, I also realised the solution that they probably wanted
[19:31:06] <Chunky_Ks> are you somewhere around "GROUP BY" in the material you're looking at?
[19:31:50] <Chunky_Ks> select student.*

[20:13:03] <Chunky_Ks> What you have there is exactly the same as I would have done it.
[20:13:18] <Chunky_Ks> not necessarily a heroic endorsement, but yes :-)
[20:19:18] <Chunky_Ks> actually, since I feel the need to poke [and numerical accuracy is super important in my day job]: ROUND(AVG(grade.value),2) AS average [...] ORDER BY average 
[20:19:44] <Chunky_Ks> if you had two students whose average rounded at 2 d.p to the same value, the order they appear in would be effectively random
[20:20:09] <fria> oww
[20:20:17] <Chunky_Ks> even if one technically hada slightly higher score than the other
[20:20:18] <fria> what will i do
[20:20:43] <Chunky_Ks> or, if your universe says that 2 d.p. is sufficient for equality, then you might order on name, alphabetically, as a tie breaker
[20:21:09] <Chunky_Ks> ORDER BY AVG(grade.value)
[20:21:18] <fria> that's unfair hahaha
[20:21:22] <Chunky_Ks> would order by the numeric value, without having rounded it at two decimal places
[20:21:34] <fria> ok
[20:21:47] <Chunky_Ks> or ORDER BY average, student.lname, student.fname
[20:21:55] <Chunky_Ks> would order by that average, then alphabetically
[20:21:59] <fria> may be i'll go with order by avg(grade.value)
[20:22:20] <Chunky_Ks> ties are still possible
[20:22:50] <fria> ok
[20:22:50] <Chunky_Ks> but at this point you cross into "what the app receiving the data needs" rather than "what does the SQL language offer?"
[20:22:55] <Chunky_Ks> so ... personal taste
[20:23:35] <fria> thanks again for the ideas
[20:23:51] <Chunky_Ks> very welcome
[20:24:12] <fria> sqlite does have password protection?
[20:25:09] <Chunky_Ks> no. sqlite is just a file on-disk
[20:25:16] <fria> use sqlite3 shell
[20:25:24] <Chunky_Ks> it's protected, as a single unit, the same way any other file would be protected
[20:25:49] <fria> by chmod?
[20:26:15] <Chunky_Ks> if you want to learn more about that aspect of databases [the more "admin" bits, as opposed to the "querying" bits], you'll be better off with another database. I recommend postgresql
[20:26:19] <Chunky_Ks> yeah. chmod
[20:26:31] <Chunky_Ks> or ACLs or whatever you normally do
[20:27:13] <fria> how about mariadb?
[20:27:52] <Chunky_Ks> yeah, maria is a mature and decent database. I still prefer postgresql, but no-one who matters would fault you for using maria, nowadays.
[20:28:36] <fria> my students use mariadb in xampp
[20:29:10] <Chunky_Ks> ah. yes.
[20:29:21] <Chunky_Ks> all-in-one ready-to-go package for students is always good
[20:29:31] <fria> they use windows here but i'm into linux
[20:29:59] <Chunky_Ks> I'm from the camp that carries no love for either PHP or MySQL/MariaDB, having worked with them for a long time, a billion years ago, and eventually getting annoyed and moving on to other stacks
[20:30:21] <fria> hahaha 
[20:30:23] <Chunky_Ks> but both PHP and Maria have matured immensely in the time since I used them, so any ill-will I bear is nowadays unfounded.
[20:30:52] <Chunky_Ks> I still choose to bear ill-will and use different [better *cough*] tools though :-D
[20:31:07] <Chunky_Ks> alrighty. I actually gotta go into work.
[20:31:12] <Chunky_Ks> have a nice day, and good luck
[20:31:35] <fria> in use php and maria db for teaching 1st year college students
[20:31:48] <fria> not into nodejs
[20:31:58] <fria> bye
[20:32:04] <fria> thanks again
[20:32:34] <Chunky_Ks> JS isn't my weapon of art, either. speaking of languages I had a poor experience with decades ago and never felt the need to go back :-)
[20:32:42] <Chunky_Ks> ok. have fun. and welcome again :-)
