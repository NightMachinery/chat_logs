[02:14:12] <Guest74> is there any way in emacs to change all occurences of a function when you change its name?
[02:15:06] <Guest74> I just finished adding workspaces to my wm and it's annoying to find an unchanged call site by the wm not working properly.
[02:16:38] <Demosthenex> find and replace?
[02:18:24] <Guest74> across multiple buffers?
[02:20:14] <Guest74> and i don't know whichbuffers they are, or whether the file containing an occurence is open in a buffer.
[02:25:21] <Xach> Guest74: you can look up callers with who-calls and do some things from there
[02:27:13] <Guest74> Xach: I was hoping I wouldn't have to and somebody else already has.  But I guess I'll have to make some refactoring tools.

[03:52:09] <mfiano> I just use iedit because I was bitten by the project-wide replace when I wasn't paying enough attention with Lisps many namespaces and all.
[03:52:14] <Guest74> _death: thanks, that looks promising. At least it has multiple file search.  and it's built for emacs.  I'd probably write my own editor first.
[03:54:06] <Guest74> Catie: mfiano: thanks, i should probably check out iedit incase I run into stuff.
[03:54:53] <mfiano> Specifically, I use evil-multiedit, which uses iedit under the hood, but I doubt many people use evil-mode here.

[04:06:08] <drbluefall> I understand the appeal of handrolling a config from scratch, but Doom has basically been good enough for as long as I can remember, and where it hasn't been has usually been fixable via a little elisp-fu in my config.el.

[04:08:28] <Guest74> I find it introduces more complexity.  Instead of just changing something that doesn't work for you, you have to figure out whether it's the default and how to change that or if it's something introduced by the config and have to change that.
[04:08:49] <Guest74> Then again, i've never tried doom.  I just remember a horrible experience with portacle.
[04:09:01] <drbluefall> For me, it serves as an abstraction.
[04:09:44] <drbluefall> It's the same reason I use a framework like actix-web, or libraries like serde or blake3.
[04:10:23] <drbluefall> I may not fully understand how they work, but they do the thing that I need them to do, and allow me to skip ahead to the thing I actually want to be making.
[04:10:33] <drbluefall> Whether that be a login system or a decent editor config.

[13:56:47] <jackdaniel> svg backend for mcclim is coming along - here a png image used as the ink for a rectangle and a circle: http://turtleware.eu/static/paste/25c45b52-foo.svg
[13:57:45] <lisp123> jackdaniel: wooo! great stuff
[13:58:03] <lisp123> Once that's done, Lisp will take over the world!
[13:58:46] <jackdaniel> I have my doubts, but I'm sure that I'll be proud of myself
[13:59:00] <jackdaniel> I've already finished the first and the second 90% of the tutorial, what is left is the last 90%
[13:59:23] *** Quits: s-liao (~s-liao@101.86.164.158) (Quit: Client closed)
[13:59:29] <lisp123> Is this the backend tutorial?
[14:00:01] <jackdaniel> yes and no - this tutorial focuses on "output-only" backends with recording and stuff
[14:00:04] *** Joins: s-liao (~s-liao@101.86.164.158)
[14:00:16] <lisp123> Understood
[14:00:38] <jackdaniel> the second tutorial will be about adding input handling for an interactive backend
[14:00:59] <lisp123> Its a tricky one because one kinda needs to re-implement the command loop
[14:01:12] <lisp123> Since most current GUI backends are based on callbacks
[14:01:17] <lisp123> So need to add that overlay
[14:01:30] <jackdaniel> no, it is enough to implement input handling - McCLIM implements the command loop based on that
[14:01:51] <lisp123> I see
[14:01:58] <jackdaniel> it is similar with drawing backends - it is enough to implement drawing operations (and transformations), recording is implemented by higher abstractions
[14:02:42] <lisp123> I see. So the amount of operations to implement in a backend isn't too big?
[14:03:25] <jackdaniel> yes, if you want to do a poor job (i.e without handling non-uniform inks and line styles) then a drawing backend is around 150 loc
[14:03:40] <lisp123> Oooh nice.
[14:03:42] <jackdaniel> as of the input - probably comparable.
[14:04:04] <jackdaniel> but if you want to polish it then the amount of code grows
[14:04:21] <jackdaniel> either way that's why I'm writing it in a form of a tutorial, to give an understanding of how things work out together
[14:04:29] <jackdaniel> (and what is needed)
[14:05:17] <beach> jackdaniel: Looks great!  Congratulations!
[14:06:05] <jackdaniel> thanks, but this is still not finished. as I've said I'm working on the third 90% of the tutorial :)

[15:50:09] <Guest74> is there a better/nicer way to do this unsigned to signed conversion? https://pastebin.com/KLbrzAeN
[15:50:36] <Guest74> besides replacing the expt with a case
[15:57:10] <beach> Add or subtract (ash 1 (1- size)) or something like that.
[15:57:37] <beach> plus or minus 1.  I didn't do the detailed calculation.
[15:58:47] <beach> Maybe (ash 1 size).
[15:59:17] <Guest74> to replace the expt part?  but that gives me all 0s after the leading 1.
[15:59:36] <Guest74> oh, i see ash then minus 1?
[15:59:40] <beach> Not to replace the expt.  For the entire calculation.
[16:00:42] <Guest74> then I don't see how that works.
[16:01:05] <beach> So if size is (say) 4 and you have 1000 (which is -8 or 8 then you can add or subtract 16 which is (ash 1 4).
[16:01:11] *** Joins: Bike (~Glossina@71.69.170.70)
[16:02:05] <kakuhen> why not something like (logior integer (- (mask-field (byte 1 (1- size)) integer)))
[16:02:15] <Guest74> oh, because lisp.  I wonder if the compiler is smart about that.
[16:02:33] <beach> kakuhen: Because that is more complicated than what I suggest?
[16:02:35] <splittist> Or, even worse https://plaster.tymoon.eu/view/2986
[16:03:02] <kakuhen> beach: if it wasnt clear, i was responding to his original question, not your suggestion
[16:03:33] <beach> kakuhen: It was clear.  But why make it so complicated?
[16:03:36] <Guest74> that's way more expensive than what i wrote!
[16:04:33] <Xach> Guest74: I usually use (dpb int (byte size 0) -1)
[16:04:52] <Xach> I find it easier to read - I don't know how the compiler treats it.

[16:07:19] <Guest74> Was wondering about this after reading the paper posted the other day about optimizations in sbcl.
[16:07:33] <Xach> I think Xof showed me that formulation 15-ish years ago

[16:24:27] <beach> So nobody likes my solution.  Oh well.
[16:24:56] <Guest74> I don't recall anybody saying that.
[16:25:31] <beach> Since two's complement is just a wraparound, the most natural thing to do is to subtract 2^size which is (ash 1 size)
[16:29:05] <Guest74> I'm not sure compilers go by what is natural.
[16:29:36] <Guest74> I can't wrap my head around the disassemblies of ash and dpb, so I guess I'll have to test.
[16:29:59] <beach> Oh, you want performance?  What can be cheaper than a shift and a subtract?
[16:31:23] <Guest74> I guess we will find out.  I they put more effort into the log fns and dpb and less into making ash smart.

[22:05:27] <Guest74> i've only been testing random negative numbers. I'm sure that would slow stuff down a bit if there was a lot of positives.
[22:06:07] <jasom> Guest74: I suspect it's faster because of the lack of branching
[22:06:26] <Guest74> I'm rewriting to test with positives.
[22:06:29] <jasom> if "size" is a constant and byte is small enough, it works out to two instructions
[22:07:15] <Guest74> if lisp compilers are aware of how to transform it.
[22:07:17] <jasom> er 3 instructions rather
[22:08:19] <jasom> SBCL does zero smart transforms and it's 3 instructions; RAX <- #x10000000; NEG RAX; OR RDx, RAX
[22:09:05] <jasom> that was for 32-bit on a 64-bit machine; I suspect 64-bits would be smarter
[22:09:30] <Guest74> if you specify the size before hand.
[22:10:27] <jasom> If you don't specify the size before hand then you're going to get really slow code in general; it will need to handle bignums properly
[22:11:13] <jasom> so in that case, checking the sign-bit will win just because the vast amount of extra work you are doing by not knowing if you need a bignum or not
[22:14:11] <Guest74> so i didn't bother changing the data and just checked with negatives and it comes out the slowest.
[22:14:53] <jasom> and for that case, it might be good to have a fixnum version and a non-fixnum version, as the fixnum version should be pretty fast and not need the bit check
[22:15:03] <jasom> which can be done with a compiler macro

[22:19:42] <jasom> I'm not sure why it thinks it needs to check for overflow in that version; will be the biggest performance hit there probably (though when inlined will go away since it still fits in a machien word)
