[10:12:15] <iamak[m]> How to create extended partition using GParted?
[10:12:24] <iamak[m]> The option is greyed out for me
[10:14:10] <purpux> iamak[m]: do you have dos partition table or a gpt partition table ? If you have a gpt partition table, you don't need extended partitions, which is why it's probably greyed out for you
[10:17:44] <iamak[m]> purpux: How do I know?
[10:18:06] <iamak[m]> My device is old and supports max 4 primary partitions which is why I'm creating extended partition
[10:19:47] <iamak[m]> Should I create a partition table using a live usb for extended partition to work?
[10:20:06] <iamak[m]> (I already have 1 existing extended partition)
[10:20:32] <purpux> iamak[m]: I don't know how gparted works, but in fdisk, you can see the partition table type is when you print your partitions
[10:21:11] <iamak[m]> 1 second let me copy my fdisk output
[10:21:18] <purpux> iamak[m]: if you can only have 4 primary partitons, then you are on the dos partition table ( I believe it's also called an MBR partition table)
[10:21:50] <iamak[m]> Yeah I'm on mbr
[10:22:05] <purpux> I don't know if you can have more than 1 extended partition in a dos table though... or your primary + extended partitions might already add up to four
[10:22:11] <iamak[m]> I remember that term from when I was setting up dual boot
[10:22:12] <purpux> iamak[m]: thought so lmao
[10:23:53] <iamak[m]> Right now I have 2 primary partitions and 1extended partition. I also have 200GB space which I want to distribute between Windows and Linux which is why I'm creating extended partition instead of formatting complete partition to ext4 (someone said exFat is a good option so both can access it but that is also greyed out :/)
[10:24:27] <purpux> iamak[m]: uhhhh
[10:24:36] <purpux> I have no idea why it's like that...
[10:24:49] <purpux> I'm not super familiar with dos partition tables
[10:24:58] <purpux> so maybe you can only have 1 extended partition
[10:25:03] <purpux> or gparted is broken
[10:25:12] <purpux> are you in gparted live ?
[10:25:34] <iamak[m]> Live as in live usb? No
[10:25:42] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> use cfdisk
[10:25:50] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> xddd
[10:26:06] <iamak[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: Is it a joke?üòÖ
[10:26:28] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i men u can use cfdisk
[10:27:09] <iamak[m]> Ok. Is it better than gparted?
[10:27:24] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> what u want to do
[10:27:43] <iamak[m]> iamak[m]: This
[10:28:00] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> let me see
[10:28:11] <iamak[m]> I have mbr table if that helps
[10:28:28] <dakship> cfdisk is very nice
[10:28:35] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> gparted would be better
[10:28:43] <dakship> its preisntalled almost everywhere too
[10:28:56] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i want cfdisk in windows 10
[10:29:12] <dakship> cringe
[10:29:19] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> sed sed sed sed se dsed sed sed sed
[10:29:30] <iamak[m]> Cfdisk is gui?
[10:29:32] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> i use wingay 10 for c++ development
[10:29:37] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> iamak[m]: terminal
[10:29:40] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> so its tu
[10:29:42] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> * so its tui
[10:29:53] <iamak[m]> I don't trust myself with cli for partitions and stuffüòê
[10:30:01] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> Kek
[10:30:01] <iamak[m]> ElJohnSepiol[m]: Ah ok
[10:30:58] <purpux> iamak[m]: you can use cfdisk if you want
[10:31:18] <purpux> gparted has broken for me more than once
[10:31:19] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> cfdisk OP
[10:31:20] <NeoVoid[m]> fdisk, cfdisk, gparted
[10:31:29] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> fdisk kinda pro peepal area
[10:31:31] <NeoVoid[m]> NeoVoid[m]: what more is there
[10:31:44] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> cgdisk too
[10:31:53] <purpux> iamak[m]: Are you sure you don't have a BIOS setting for enabling GPT ?
[10:31:56] <dakship> iamak[m]: its tui
[10:32:00] <dakship> so in middle
[10:32:06] <dakship> try it once
[10:32:15] <ElJohnSepiol[m]> bro using thinkpad with core 2 duo
[10:32:24] <purpux> GPT is a lot more modern and you can basically make unlimited partitions
[10:32:44] <iamak[m]> purpux: Windows doesn't support gpt on mbr, only dos. I read it just now. And I need windows for the few games which don't support Linux
[10:33:23] <purpux> iamak[m]: Windows most definitely supports GPT. You might need to migrate it from MBR to GPT (there is a tab for that in Windows)
[10:34:00] <purpux> iamak[m]: seriously, check your BIOS, and see if you can use GPT. If your computer is make in the last 10-12 years, you should be able to use GPT
[10:34:02] <iamak[m]> > When you deploy Windows to a BIOS-based device, you must format hard drives by using an MBR file system. Windows does not support the GUID partition table (GPT) file system on BIOS-based computers.
[10:34:30] <iamak[m]> My computer doesn't have uefi. Only bios. So I'm stuck with mbr
[10:34:30] <purpux> iamak[m]: Exactly. If you have UEFI, you can enable GPT
[10:34:36] <purpux> iamak[m]: oh nvm
[10:34:42] <iamak[m]> üò™
[10:34:57] <iamak[m]> Also yeah only 1 extended partition is supported
[10:35:22] <purpux> iamak[m]: I thought so... you can try messing around with your current extended partition to include that 200 GB more
[10:35:46] <purpux> I don't really know how extended partitions work though, so I cannot help you with that
[10:36:08] <iamak[m]> purpux: Yes that's how I'll do it
[10:36:19] <iamak[m]> purpux: I don't know about anything xD
[10:36:31] <iamak[m]> If this fails, I'll screw up both windows and Linux
[10:36:41] <iamak[m]> * fails, I'll probably screw up
[10:37:15] <iamak[m]> Is it possible to extend Linux partition (ext4) without format?
[10:40:43] <iamak[m]> I think I did it successfullyüôÇ

[19:05:28] <iamak[m]> Does anyone know why Android ROMs need a custom build per device  despite having the Linux kernel when 1 iso works for each device?

[19:05:43] <AryaK[m]> arm
[19:06:03] <iamak[m]> But aren't all devices either arm or arm64
[19:06:18] <AryaK[m]> yes but their arm implementations are different
[19:06:19] <iamak[m]> Like all PCs are x86/x64
