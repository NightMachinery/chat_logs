[00:02:01] <ilmari> iirc java lets you omit `this.` from method calls. but that's really inconsistent as soon as you have another object of the same class
[00:03:10] <Grinnz> also, its compiler knows what you're calling a method on so it's doing it implicitly anyway to follow inheritance
[00:03:25] <ilmari> because in java everything is a method
[00:03:33] <ilmari> as long as you have free functions, you have to disambiguate
[00:03:57] <ilmari> s/long/soon/
[00:04:11] <Grinnz> ah yes, freedom of functions, forgot that part of the 1st amendment

[02:18:47] <perigrin> From a purely pedantic standpoint there is no one single property of OO that is really fundamental. Rust and Go both have structs that you can call methods on but don't have inheritance (they use delegation in clever ways to emulate parts of it), and VB6/VBA had Classes but didn't have inheritance (apparently?, it's been a while since I did VB6). 
[02:21:39] <LeoNerd> VB6 indeed did not have inheritance

[02:28:27] <xenu> i believe the bare minimum is struct with methods

[02:29:30] *** Joins: tejr (~tejr@user/tejr)
[02:30:02] <perigrin> Doesn’t have to be a struct, look at Inside out objects
[02:30:35] <xenu> what about them? they still have data attached to them
[02:30:35] <perigrin> Data and a function specialized on that data … everything else can be derived
[02:30:41] <xenu> that's what i meant
[02:32:59] *** gordonfish- is now known as gordonfish
[02:37:15] <perigrin> There was a video I saw once where Kaye said that Erlang Actors were the closest to his idea of OO.
[02:39:23] <Grinnz> so you'd say C has objects?
[02:40:24] <perigrin> Actually they talk about that in SCIP. I’ve seen C that was written in what is arguably an OO style. Basically God Objects
[02:41:16] <perigrin> But everything was oriented around the structs that were passed around rather than the functions
[02:42:23] <perigrin> (I’m hardly a C guy though, I suspect the code I saw would be considered appalling from people who work with C regularly)
[02:45:03] <xenu> Grinnz: functions and data are completely separate in C
[02:45:36] <Grinnz> you have structs and you can put functions in them
[02:46:11] <xenu> that's not really a first class feature though, all functions are still global
[02:46:51] <LeoNerd> you -can- store function pointers in structs but there's no handy invocation syntax for that
[02:47:15] <LeoNerd> About the best you usually do is just pretty-promise-honest to pass the struct itself into the function, somewhere
[02:47:18] <xenu> pointers, not functions, that's an important distinction
[02:47:40] <LeoNerd> (*self->vtable->method)(self, other, args)   is typical
[02:47:43] <xenu> although on a second thought, it's similar to how classes in perl work

[11:42:36] <Mandevil> I assume the former, but want to be sure.

[21:03:32] <daemon> do you still need to read <STDIN> for well reading STDIN or is there a nice $stdin or something somewhere
[21:03:42] <Grinnz> readline(*STDIN)
[21:03:55] <daemon> ah still the bare word then
[21:03:59] <Grinnz> it's the same thing, but without the two ambiguities
[21:04:04] <Grinnz> *STDIN is a variable, not a bareword
[21:04:13] <daemon> with a * not a $
[21:04:17] <Grinnz> yes
[21:04:24] <daemon> ok dokey
[21:04:30] <mjgardner> We call it a "glob".
[21:04:35] <Grinnz> bareword handles are really just an old way to refer to global typeglobs
[21:04:57] <daemon> I see
[21:04:58] <LeoNerd> On my list of plans, is to support some syntax like  $*STDIN  for that, so it looks and feels like a normal var
[21:05:07] <daemon> LeoNerd++ # good idea
[21:05:09] <LeoNerd> I've not got around to it yet because So Maby Things bigger than that
[21:05:42] <xenu> *FOO doesn't help much compared to FOO, it's still exempt from strict
[21:05:57] <Grinnz> it helps the parser
[21:05:59] <thrig> eval: printf *STDERR "uh"
[21:06:00] <perlbot> thrig: ERROR: syntax error at (IRC) line 1, near "*STDERR "uh"" 
[21:06:07] <xenu> although it will trigger 'once' warnings
[21:06:15] <xenu> unlike the bareword form
[21:06:34] <Grinnz> anyway, you shouldn't be declaring global typeglob handles either way
[21:06:45] <Grinnz> so it only matters for *STDIN, *STDOUT, *DATA, etc
[21:06:46] <lopid> i thought $ was for scalar not variable
[21:07:02] <Grinnz> it's... a scalar variable?
[21:07:20] <lopid> yeah but, should array variables be $@foo ?
[21:07:24] <LeoNerd> $one_thing  @many_things_positionally  %many_things_associatively
[21:07:25] <Grinnz> no?
[21:07:39] <LeoNerd> "scalar" is a mathematical word, for.. well, for not being a vector. Being a single thing
[21:07:46] <lopid> but globs are ok to be $*
[21:07:56] <Grinnz> well, they should have never been typeglobs
[21:07:59] <Grinnz> filehandles that is
[21:08:05] <LeoNerd> Mathematically a "scalar" is a single number. Though scalar variables in programming languages generally can hold other things than just numbers
[21:08:09] <Grinnz> they're conceptually scalar values
[21:08:37] <daemon> could 'use filehandles;' not automatically implement our $stdin/out/..

[21:13:03] <pragma-> the worst thing about emojis is that every platform draws their emojis differently. there are many documented cases of one platform's happy-looking emoji apeparing to be angry on another platform, which causes communication issues as the other party misunderstands the emotions involved.
