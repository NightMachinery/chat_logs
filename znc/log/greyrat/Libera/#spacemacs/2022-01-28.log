[07:37:15] <FromGitter> <mcp292> Is there a way to bring the magit hunk you're on to the top? This seems to happen for any subsequent hunks after the first, but not for the first. Yes I can do `C-l` but I'd like to not cross vim and emacs bindings. `zt` and `zz`are all taken under the `magit-stash` prefix. I didn't find anything under the `g` prefix besides `gr` which is unrelated but very nice!

[19:14:09] <FromGitter> <rivertam> Hello! I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for pane management. In my vim config, I map <Leader>+q to `:q`, <Leader>+h to `<C-w> h`, <Leader>+j to `<C-w> j` etc. so I can use SPC h, SPC j, SPC k, SPC l to very quickly hop between panes, and SPC q to very quickly close these panes. This is a really important part of my workflow such that I'm having trouble even doing things like editing my config file without 
[19:14:10] <FromGitter> ... it. Is it possible to do this? It seems like it would overwrite a lot of important menus (`SPC q`, `SPC h`, `SPC k`, and `SPC l` are all menus).

[19:18:01] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @rivertam What do you mean with panes? You mean frames (called windows in Emacs)?
[19:19:25] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Because then I guess most of what you are looking for can be found under `SPC w`
[19:20:21] <FromGitter> <franpenedo:matrix.org> rivertam (Ben Berman) I'd go with an alternative. Your binds are already under `SPC w`, except for deleting a window which is `SPC w d`, although `SPC w q` is free so you can rebind it. You can also find them under `C-w`, where deleting a window is `C-w c`, although you can probably override `C-w q`. I'd look for a different "leader" key for your binds
[19:20:22] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Also you can jump by window number using `SPC` `number` or `M number`
[19:20:54] <FromGitter> <franpenedo:matrix.org> I personally use `s-[hjkl]`
[19:22:14] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @franpenedo:matrix.org That sounds handy too indeed
[19:23:09] <FromGitter> <rivertam> That was extremely helpful, thank you everyone! I may just try to get used to SPC w first thing -- I didn't see it before
[19:24:07] <FromGitter> <franpenedo:matrix.org> I also use this, but sometimes it's annoying since it's not always obvious which number you need, and it gets worse if you have several frames, since any `winum-scope` other than `global` is bugged for me when using emacs server
[19:25:51] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Haha... yeah, I will try your s-[hjkl] suggestion. It sounds better than what I am using now (usually just `SPC w w`)
[19:26:48] <FromGitter> <franpenedo:matrix.org> you need some thumb flexibility, but it's not *too* bad
[19:28:24] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Thumb? for `s`? I will use the ringfinger for that
