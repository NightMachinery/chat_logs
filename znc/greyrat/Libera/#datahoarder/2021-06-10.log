[17:24:39] <skye0> It's shitty that it's even had to happen but the fact that terrorism has had to happen in order for people to notice social issues does say something
[17:26:36] <skye0> A lot of terrorist attacks carried out by Muslims has at least signaled to the general public their dissatisfaction with the system, although there are extremists who want to install patriarchal Islam like the Taliban, which I don't think worked as well as they wanted to unless they expected a system of constant struggle and pain despite one's faith in God.
[17:27:34] <skye0> Terrorist attacks by the far right at least have signaled to the general public that they're not just some internet edgelords trying to pull off pranks and that their shitty belief systems have an impact.

[18:20:58] <chazy> or does this mean sata ports have no dedicated channels?
[18:21:39] <chazy> that'd be weird as i'm reading the specs and it says "6 x SATA 6Gb/s connectors" shouldn't that be 6 dedicated channels for each port?

[20:45:48] <chazy> i read SAS 1 only supports up to 2TB drives, what is the limitation for SAS 2? i can't find it anywhere
[20:55:50] *** vx- is now known as v_X
[21:05:44] <Allie> chazy: SAS2 uses 48-bit block addresses. maximum disk size w/ 512-byte sectors is 128petabytes, iirc, and if you're using 4k-byte sectors you can get up to 1 exabyte per disk
[21:06:20] <Allie> SAS1 is 32-bit, hence the limitation
[21:06:23] <chazy> Allie: i guess the problem would be the controller, do expanders have controllers?
[21:08:35] <chazy> i mean expanders are not pcie devices, they are not detected by the kernel
[21:08:51] <Allie> chazy: sas expanders are a bit like network switches
[21:08:52] <chazy> and looks like the one i have is not sas1 but 2 https://www.tonitrus.com/en/ManufacturerDatasheet?articleDetailId=71978
[21:09:09] <Allie> SAS1 is *old*, it is unlikely you are using it
[21:10:15] <chazy> hmm then what's the problem? i connect my motherboard ports to the expander and the expander to the backplane but the system does not boot it's stuck in the mobo logo screen and it doesn't get past it
[21:10:52] <chazy> without the expander, connecting the sata ports directly to the backplane it works fine
[21:11:15] <Allie> chazy: wait, SATA or SAS
[21:11:18] <Allie> they're different technologies
[21:11:30] <chazy> the sata ports from the motherboard
[21:11:40] <Allie> what are you plugging those into 
[21:11:51] <chazy> when i connect them to the backplane using reverse breakout cables it works just fine
[21:12:06] <chazy> i can see the disks in linux
[21:12:20] <Allie> ... but you're connecting the SAS expander with reverse breakout cables to the motherboard's *sata* ports?

[21:13:46] <Allie> if you're doing sata *over* sas (which some backplanes support) with a reverse breakout cable, that sometimes works
[21:14:18] <chazy> but expanders only work with sas cards?
[21:14:27] <Allie> yes, because expanders are SAS, not SATA
[21:14:51] <Allie> you need a HBA to use a SAS expander
[21:15:23] <chazy> so i guess i could get these 1x sata to 5 boards and that would share the 6 channel bandwidth from the mobo to the expander?
[21:16:01] <Allie> why not just get an HBA and do it properly? 
[21:16:36] <chazy> to keep this under $150, expander cards are so expensive then an hba card that supports 18tb drives, that'd like $500-600
[21:17:58] <Allie> chazy: an LSI 9211-8i is about £80 second-hand... 
[21:18:16] <chazy> does it support 18TB disks?
[21:20:02] *** Quits: thedragon (~thedragon@user/thedragon) (Remote host closed the connection)
[21:20:27] <chazy> and that's only the hba card, what about an expander for 24 disks??
[21:20:41] <Allie> you already have a SAS2 expander, right? 
[21:21:09] <chazy> ah yes, and the specs say it's sas2, but it also say it's for hpe pro whatever servers
[21:21:41] <Allie> I mean, SAS expanders are SAS expanders
[21:22:00] <chazy> i guess it could work but it says "on select ProLiant servers when connected to a Smart Array P410 Controller (SA-P410) or Smart Array P410i Controller (SA-P410i)."
[21:23:09] <Allie> yup, becuase that's what HP sell it for
[21:23:12] <chazy> what i don't understand is the sas/sata bandwidth
[21:23:23] <chazy> it says sas 6g and sata 3g
[21:23:43] <chazy> if the disks are sas they work at 6g and if the disks are sata they only work at 3g?
