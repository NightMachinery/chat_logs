Assuming the n-1th "stage" is connected, and n-simplices are connected, then the union should also be connected (since they have points in common)

[02:40:30] <adder`> okay, you draw a unit circle, and a point that goes 1 to the left and 1.73 up
[02:40:31] <specing> In practice I used calculator's atan2. But if you aren't allowed a calculator then drawing is simplest
[02:40:33] <adder`> then what?
[02:40:40] <Fangs> adder`: its really not much of magic. you generally try to see which 'quadrant' your complex number is, and you form a right triangle using the two legs
[02:40:58] <Fangs> then depending on your convention you either add/substract from -pi, pi, or 0, or 2pi, or -2pi
[02:41:04] <specing> then you check the angle with the ruler
[02:41:24] <Fangs> (your argument is only well defined up to some multiple of 2pi.. since e^2pi*i = 1)
[02:42:23] <adder`> so it seems like guessing is the best we've got
[02:42:50] <Fangs> adder`: anyway.. for exams usually, if they explicitly ask for an angle, they'd normally give you a triangle that's 'similar' to the usual one of the two triangles..
[02:42:54] <Fangs> https://www.gmatsyllabus.com/images/stories/quant/special%20right%20triangles.jpg <--
[02:43:04] <Fangs> *except remember to use radians
[02:44:24] <Fangs> 10:10 <adder`> okay, you draw a unit circle, and a point that goes 1 to the left and 1.73 up <-- you dont want to be working with decimal (approximation) of sqrt(3)
[02:45:03] <Fangs> your -1+sqrt(3)i is an example where you'll apply the "30-60-90" triangle in that picture
[02:45:27] <adder`> so it's 90+30?
[02:45:44] <adder`> i.e. (2pi)/3

[04:33:19] <Fangs> ok so lets start a bit slowly yeah... so you have a 'line' of some sort.. here's the graph of those functions
[04:33:26] <Fangs> https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/OB32r1yO/integral.jpg
[04:34:00] <Fangs> so really you are looking at the line inetgral along the red line, followed by the blue line right? (up to the point where they intersect)
[04:34:32] *** Joins: [itchyjunk] (~itchyjunk@user/itchyjunk/x-7353470)
[04:34:38] <Pi-sistance> yep, all the info ive seen suggested i have to parameterize the curve
[04:34:47] <Fangs> the 'primitive' way to do a line integral is to parameterize this like.. say you rwite down a function c(t) = (x(t),y(t)).. and then you use the chain rule to get something integrable in terms of "t"
[04:35:20] <Fangs> {x(t)*y(t) dx/dt} dt + {2x(t)-y(t) dy/dt} dt
[04:35:22] <Pi-sistance> surely there are plenty of curves that cant be parameterized trhough
[04:35:52] <Fangs> they can be hard to parameterize, sure
[04:36:06] <Fangs> but this is the "literall" meaning of how you do line integral
[04:36:23] *** Quits: robin (~robin@user/terpri) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:36:34] <Fangs> Pi-sistance: the neat thing about multivariable calculus is that you get to use things like green's theorem.. to turn it into surface integral
[04:37:01] <Fangs> so lets say I have some region D, stoke's theorem says
[04:37:24] <Fangs> \integral_{boundary D} xy dx +2x-y dy = \integral_D "d(foobar)"
[04:37:33] <Pi-sistance> yeah that was easy to do, in fact I wasnt even taught how to calculate the line integtrals in vector fields at all
[04:37:34] *** Joins: foobaz212 (~foobaz212@152.37.103.80)
[04:38:09] <Pi-sistance> its ok, ill learn more about it when I have to I guess, was just curious whether it was a hard problem
[04:38:24] <Fangs> where d(foobar) is the 'derivative' of the differential form xy dx +2x-y dy... thats a lot of jargon for basically saying you have to compute: d/dy( xy) dy^dx + d/dx(2x-y) dx^dy
[04:38:39] <Fangs> and you kinda have to note that dy^dx = -dx^dy becuse of orientation reason

[05:11:07] <Fangs> Pi-sistance: how did you evaluate it?
[05:12:19] <Pi-sistance> the cheating greens way, i cant do the other way cos ive not even learnt more than very basics of line integrals
[05:13:59] <Fangs> Pi-sistance: you should try parameterizing it
[05:14:03] <Fangs> or do the line integral
[05:14:58] <Fangs> c_1(t) = (t,t^2) from 0 to 1.. and then c_2(t) = (t^2,t) from 1 to 0
[05:16:33] <Pi-sistance> ok thanks, that should help me learn it.
[05:16:53] <Fangs> {x(t)*y(t) dx/dt} dt + {2x(t)-y(t) dy/dt} dt <-- using c_1 you get (t^3)*dx/dt dt + (2t -t^2)* dy/dt dt = t^3 dt + (2t-t^2) 2t dt from 0 to 1
[05:17:38] <Fangs> then do the same with c_2 (but remember to account for the fact that you are going from 1 to 0.. so there's going to be a negative sign somewhere)

[08:45:16] <Hazey_Dream> So a standard deviation of 1/8 means that the measure of how much a singular standard deviation is is equal to 1/8?
[08:45:36] <pavonia> So the center of that curve, i.e. the mean value,  is 1 in your case
[08:45:51] <Hazey_Dream> So 2 standard deviations away from mean would be 75% of mean, since 2 eighths is 25%? With 1 as mean, that'd be 0.75, right?
[08:46:58] <pavonia> It's not about how far the value is away from the center, it's about the probability of its occurrence
[08:47:46] <Hazey_Dream> Ah. So a standard deviation of 1/8 mean that being "1 standard deviation" different from mean has a 12.5% chance of occurrence?
[08:48:04] <pavonia> Values from 1 to 1+1/8 have a chance of bein drawn in 34.1% of cases, values from 1+1/8 to 1+2/8 have a chance of 13.6& etc.

[08:50:28] <Hazey_Dream> Ah okay.
[08:50:30] <greenbagels> There's no hard and fast rule for generic probability distributions that tells you exactly X% is within Y standard deviations
[08:50:39] <greenbagels> There is one for normal distributions specifically however
[08:52:34] <Hazey_Dream> So, if the random variable in a case is σ=1/8, then would probabilities be different, compared to a normal distribution?
[08:52:52] <Hazey_Dream> (I presume I'm misunderstanding something, just not sure what.)
[08:53:48] <greenbagels> There is an infinite family of normal distributions
[08:53:56] <Hazey_Dream> A distribution has a mean, standard deviations to measure spread, & probabilities, right? I'm largely unsure what 1/8 affects in the case I brought up.
[08:54:09] <Hazey_Dream> "a random number is drawn from a normal distribution² with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 1/8."

[08:55:26] <greenbagels> Yes what pavonia said
[08:55:27] <Hazey_Dream> Okay
[08:56:05] <greenbagels> If you go to desmos you can write the formula for the probability density function

[08:58:00] <Hazey_Dream> HEIGHT A few simple steps determine the height of a Pokémon. First, a random number is drawn from a normal distribution² with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 1/8. We call this random number RANDOM HEIGHT, and it is independent of the Pokémon species in question.
[08:58:09] <Hazey_Dream> Next, RANDOM HEIGHT is multiplied by the height value listed in the Pokémon’s Pokédex entry (or more specifically the game master file, which contains full, unrounded values) in order to get the final height of the Pokémon. Simple as that!
[08:58:46] <greenbagels> Here I have to run for like 5 min but I can talk more when I'm back, if no one else resolves this confusion
[08:58:48] <Hazey_Dream> Even if a distribution can be infinite, there's a finite number of Pokemon heights, & AFAIK, the games only round/calculate to so many digits before they would truncate the number.

[09:45:10] <greenbagels> there's 2 kinds
[09:45:16] <tusko> greenbagels, I think its something like cos(x)*sin^3(x)/3
[09:45:31] <greenbagels> there's something like dice rolling, where the number of outcomes is finite, and we call those discrete random variables
[09:45:41] <Fangs> tusko: its an (improper) definite integral
[09:45:54] <greenbagels> in that situation it usually makes sense to say "what is the probability of a single outcome" and have it be nonzero
[09:46:05] <Fangs> you shouldn't be getting a function when you integrate from -oo to oo
[09:46:23] <tusko> So this would make it divergent?
[09:46:30] <greenbagels> then we have something like "heights of people" where it has infinitely many possibilities that can *continuously* vary

[09:49:45] <greenbagels> say instead of meters we use millimeters; but then we could use micrometers; but then we could use nanometers; ...
[09:50:06] <Hazey_Dream> So, in situations like this, are there options to determine what results are more probable? I mean, surely part of the point of a distribution is determining probability, right?

[09:51:10] <tusko> Fangs, no worries. I think there is some obvious property I can use but I can't figure what it would be

[09:51:44] <Hazey_Dream> Well, quoting what lead me to my question: https://thesilphroad.com/science/big-magikarp-tiny-rattata
[09:51:52] <tusko> I thought it was convolution theorem, but I have to decompose sin(wt) rect(t/D) as a product of two, square integrable functions.
[09:51:56] <Hazey_Dream> "The XL and XS displayed next to a Pokémon’s height or weight on its information screen are determined by the deviation from the mean height or weight of that species. Anything more than 2 standard deviations above the mean height or weight is XL, and anything less than 2 standard deviations below the mean height or weight is XS."
[09:52:10] <tusko> Then, the Fourier transform would be the convolution of their individual transforms
[09:52:32] <tusko> but sin(wt) seems to not be square integrable
[09:52:40] <Hazey_Dream> So let's say the interval around the height are 2 standard deviations ( 1/8 in this case) since being 2 standard deviations away results in being XS or XL.

[09:53:43] <Fangs> usually with periodic functions you care only about a piece of the interval where it is periodic

[09:55:09] <tusko> rect(t/d) is a rectangular pulse, centered at the origin with amplitude 1

[09:55:24] <Fangs> tusko: so you only care about square-integrability of sin(wt) over -D/2 to D/2
[09:55:46] <Hazey_Dream> Obviously, there's tons of Pokemon species with different average heights. A Metapod is 50 cm, but an Ivysaur is 100 cm, for example. So ideally, the methodology would be flexible to be able to determine probabilities of exceptional sizes for different species.
[09:55:47] <Fangs> basically you're only square-integrating this over -D/2 to D/2
[09:55:57] <tusko> and so that's -pi to pi

[09:58:23] <Fangs> tusko: just out of curiosity whats x(t)?

[09:59:31] <greenbagels> so if we are wondering what the chance of picking something within some interval is, we just find that area
[09:59:50] <greenbagels> thats what the 5th box calculates, and the graph and number it spits out will change as you vary the different sliders
[10:00:03] <Hazey_Dream> What if a very small area is selected?
[10:00:33] <greenbagels> then the probability, in general, will be small; but depending onμ and  σ, this might not be the case
[10:01:17] <greenbagels> like [-0.00000001, 0.00000001] is small, but if μ=0 and σ=0.0000000000000001, this will still be a relatively huge window
[10:01:59] <Hazey_Dream> \int_{a}^{b}p\left(x\right)dx = 0.0131801871647
[10:02:19] <Hazey_Dream> Roughly that part of the screen indicates probability of something being within a small range, right?

[11:14:55] <int-e> Well... honestly I don't care about the Pokemon angle.
[11:15:20] <Hazey_Dream> Yeah, I guess, but I'm asking what it offers from a coding standpoint.
[11:15:27] <Hazey_Dream> First, a random number is drawn from a normal distribution² with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 1/8. We call this random number RANDOM HEIGHT, and it is independent of the Pokémon species in question.
[11:15:34] <Hazey_Dream> Next, RANDOM HEIGHT is multiplied by the height value listed in the Pokémon’s Pokédex entry (or more specifically the game master file, which contains full, unrounded values) in order to get the final height of the Pokémon. Simple as that!
[11:16:27] <Hazey_Dream> I guess it makes greater extremes rarer, & keeps things average? Are there other benefits to it?
[11:21:46] <int-e> it's simple, it has adds some variabilit, and I expect that it resembles real life height distibutions. So... plenty good enough for a video game.

[12:40:39] <int-e> So does p(x) split over that field? It has one root, so there's some progress at least...
[12:40:43] *** Joins: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3)
[12:41:57] <cadmio> well it'd split this way p(x) = (x-a)g(x) where g(x) in Z_2[x]/((p(x))
[12:42:17] <river> so remember when you first asked this

[12:48:39] <Franciman> but b, c can't be in Z_2, or p would be reducible there
[12:49:03] <Franciman> well if g is reducible, you're done

[12:51:22] <Franciman> it's not necessary to know what it is, it's second degree, so if it has one root in Z_2(a), then both roots are in it
[12:52:14] <greenbagels> Hmm I should review ring theory, it seems more fun than I remember
[12:52:23] <Franciman> greenbagels: this is field theory
[12:52:31] <Franciman> (just to help looking at the relevant parts)
[12:53:29] <Franciman> g(x) is either reducible or irreducible. If it's reducible, then Z_2(a) contains all its roots

[12:54:45] <Franciman> i have a question, how do i know what Z_2[x]/(p(x)) is?
[12:54:48] <Franciman> wait i must know it
[12:56:21] <cadmio> that field consists of residue classes i.e. the remainders of the division of the polynomial f(x) in ℤ2[x] by x^3 + x^ + 1
[12:56:56] <Franciman> hm Z_2(a) is a Z_2-vector space of dim 3
[12:56:58] <Franciman> ok
[12:57:08] <Franciman> int-e: why 8 possible values then?
[12:57:12] <Fangs> Franciman: its Z_2[a] where a^3 + a^2 = 1
[12:57:31] <Fangs> well.. a^3 = 1 + a^2
[12:58:09] <cadmio> Since f(x) = q(x)p(x) + r(x) and q(x)p(x) is already in the ideal I = (p(x)), then f(x) + I = r(x) + I and, with r a 2nd degree polynomial, r(x) = ax^2 + bx + x,
[12:58:13] <Fangs> Franciman: 1, a, a^2, 1+a, 1+a^2, a+a^2, 1+a+a^2
[12:58:14] <Fangs> and 0
[12:58:23] <Franciman> dope
[12:58:25] <Franciman> thanks
[13:00:12] <river> someone smart reminded me of the frobenius automorphism, in char p f(x^p) = f(x)^p

[13:24:53] <Fangs> is it just a x^2?

[13:25:50] <river> you should collect like terms
[13:25:55] <Fangs> another potential way you can find the factorization is to skip figuring out the 2nd degree polynomial entirely

[13:26:23] <river> right?

[21:16:14] <Rider99> Looking at some scale analysis stuff. My understanding is that div(\vec{u}) can be approximated as magnitude(u)/L , where L is a length scale. Can we approximate curl(\vec{u}) as magnitude(u)/L aswell?

[21:17:22] <cocomo> I have this intuition about division which is the number of times a part(denominator) contained within the whole(numerator) but the intuition feels inadequate when units are different.
[21:17:28] <dude12312414> well one obvious issue is that curl returns a vector, not a scalar
[21:17:42] <widp> what is the difference between l^p space vs a p norm?
[21:17:47] <widp> how are they related?
[21:18:09] <dude12312414> also i'm guessing the length scales could be different, so your L in the curl would not be the same as the L in the div
[21:18:18] <Z-module> l^p space is a normed vector space using that p-norm as its norm
[21:19:26] <Z-module> l^p(N), for example, is the space of all real or maybe complex sequences (a_n) such that the infinite series  SUM_n |a_n|^p  is finite. Then the p-norm of that element is the pth root of that sum.

[21:30:26] <Z-module> So for example, widp, R^3 with the "standard" norm  ||(x,y,z)|| = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)   is a normed space.  l^2(N) is similar, but its elements are now infinite sequences like  v = (r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, ...)   where the sum of the infinite series  (r_1)^2 + (r_2)^2 + ...    is finite, and the 2-norm  ||v||_2  is just  (that sum)^(1/2). For any real p >= 1, the p-norm is defined similarly, and l^p(N) is all the infinite sequences such
[21:30:26] <Z-module> that  (r_1)^p + (r_2)^p + ...    is finite.

[21:31:34] <Z-module> widp, l^p is an entire space of vectors, all of which are infinite sequences of reals (or you can use complex entries).
[21:32:08] <Z-module> the l_p norm defined *on* that space is just a certain function from the whole vector space l_p into [0, +infty), satisfying certain properties.

[21:33:04] <Z-module> not an extension
[21:33:22] <Z-module> One is a vector space, the other is function from that space into [0, +infty)
[21:33:50] <Z-module> just as R^3 as a vector space over R, and its standard norm (the l_2 norm, really) is a function R^3 -> [0, +infty)

[21:35:00] <widp> oh , right ok ok
[21:35:05] <Z-module> But to form the vector space l^p, we don't talk all infinite sequences (r_1, r_2, ...) whatsoever. We take only those such that  SUM_n |r_n|^p  is a convergent infinite series.
[21:35:05] <Rider99> when it says isotropic, homogenous equations of motion
[21:35:40] <Z-module> and then l_p of that vector is defined as the nonnegative real number  (that series sum)^(1/p)
