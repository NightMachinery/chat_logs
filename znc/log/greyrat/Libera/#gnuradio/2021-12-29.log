[17:48:15] <Reventlov[m]> Hello, I was wondering if this thing could be seen as some "model" of some SDR reception chain using direct conversion
[17:49:09] <funkylab[m]> I'll go with no, since the sine and the cosine have different frequencies
[17:49:29] <funkylab[m]> oh wait
[17:49:33] <funkylab[m]> ah no, that's fine
[17:49:59] <funkylab[m]> yeah, that would basically work, but don't forget that you'll need low-pass filters after the mixers
[17:50:14] <funkylab[m]> ... which you even have, sorry.
[17:51:19] <willcode4[m]> The phase offset should in the second LO should take the LO frequency into account.
[17:51:32] <willcode4[m]> s/should//
[17:55:05] <willcode4[m]> I'm looking at the code to see whether phase is already relative to the source freq ...
[17:57:43] <willcode4[m]> Yes, that's all set.

[20:21:01] <Crofton[m]> https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues
[20:21:24] <yesno> Crofton[m]: tnx
[20:21:56] <Reventlov> Small question just to be sure I understand (sorry, I didn't found any generic DSP irc / matrix channel yet). When you down-sample with mixing a "real" signal, you have to keep it over positive frequencies to avoid folding of the signal on itself, right ? One side effect is that if the signal has a bandwidth B, you need to sample at twice the size of the bandwidth because of the Shannon-Hartley
[20:21:58] <Reventlov> relation. Which is why using I/Qs is nice, because you don't have any folding, right ?
[20:37:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> You're on the right track.  A direct-conversion receiver uses an LO frequency that is at exactly the desired tuned frequency.  If you do this with a conventional mixer then, yes, the negative and positive frequenices "fold" over each other.  That turns out to have been quite acceptable for early direct-conversion receivers that were exclusively used for AM modulation.  But once you move beyond that, you need to use a quadrature mixer
[20:37:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> approach, with phase-offset LO to separate the I/Q components.  Even in I/Q, you're still achieving the Nyquist sampling criterion, because you're sampling twice during every internal--once "in-phase" and another in quadrature to that.  So Nyquist is still applicable, just in a slightly-different way.
[20:41:15] *** Quits: massi (~massi@host-188-15-128-106.business.telecomitalia.it) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:57:06] <Reventlov> so using I/Q is a net gain in this regard, by sampling at f I can have signal with a bandwidth "f" for a "small" hardware cost
[20:58:59] <Yamakaja[m]> Well, technically you're sampling at 2*f because you have two ADCs running at f, but it's still a gain because you can fit more information into your bandwidth compared to real sampling
[21:00:32] <Reventlov> thanks :)
[21:01:41] <bpadalino> Yamakaja[m]: can you explain that last sentence again ?

[21:58:05] <willcode4[m]> I think of it (correctly or not): from a math point of view it's just a different representation, from a hardware point of view adc/dac cost is lower (which may not be as important now for lower end devices). I wish I understood the difference in linearity and distortion between I/Q sampling and real sampling, when it comes to the non-adc/dac components.

[22:24:22] <patchvonbraun[m]> One should probably make the distinction between a real-sampled Low-IF archtiecture and a real-sampled direct RF architecture.  Their costs and drawbacks are different.
[22:27:32] <patchvonbraun[m]> Any mixer architecture is subject to images, and the engineering question, in a sense, is "where would you like those images to be?".   In an I/Q direct-conversion architecture, in effect the I/Q imbalance produces *in band* images.  In any kind of IF architecture those images are from out-of-band, and filtering can help eliminate them.  Now, of course, there are polyphase mixers that produce *superb* image performance--the AirSpyHF+
[22:27:32] <patchvonbraun[m]> is an example.   I/Q mixers driven by 2XLO phase-splitters also have good image performance because the phase-balance is usually very very good.

[22:43:35] <helinox[m]> How can i transmit a CW tone out of a B210 at the devices Center frequency. Using a signal source at 1Khz produces an offset freq and it looks like im loosing some power due to alias's 
[22:45:36] <patchvonbraun[m]> Actually, given the DC-offset removal, you probably WANT to have the baseband be offset from DC, and compensate by changing the center frequency
[22:45:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> Also, use a baseband amplitude that's no greater than about 0.9.  Otherwise, there's a chance of over-driving some of the analog components.

[22:46:21] <helinox[m]> thanks! how far off DC would you recommend?
[22:47:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> My rule of thumb is a few hundred Hz in either direction.  It's likely narrower than that, but in this case, you don't need to get that tight.
[22:48:19] <patchvonbraun[m]> Also make sure you aren't driving at max RF gain either.  
[22:53:17] <helinox[m]> Looks like that actually made my ERP go down. So you were saying generate something like a 500 hz sine wave than adjust the USRP by - 500 Hz resulting in a CW at my desired CF
[22:53:58] <patchvonbraun[m]> helinox: Yes
[22:56:06] <helinox[m]> Case 1 where i transmit 1 khz sine and dont offset the usrp TX freq i'm readying -18 dbm, case 2 where i generate the same 1 khz sign and offset the usrp by 1 khz i read -41 dbm
[22:56:18] <helinox[m]> sine*
[22:57:08] <helinox[m]> sine amplitude is 0.9 and the rx/tx gain was the same between the two cases
[22:57:42] <patchvonbraun[m]> What sample rate, and what did you set the IF bandwidth to?
[22:59:40] <helinox[m]> same as my signal source sample rate 216 khz
[22:59:42] <bpadalino> Yamakaja[m]: your statement that it's still a gain because you can fit more information into your bandwidth compared to real sampling had me confused
[23:00:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> helinox: See if widening the bandwidth helps
[23:01:51] <patchvonbraun[m]> The IF filters aren't infinitely variable, so the hardware will chose the closest.  
[23:02:08] <patchvonbraun[m]> Also how are you measuring the power?
[23:03:00] <helinox[m]> are you talking about the Ch0 bandwidth under RF options? I always thought the USRPs sample rate and the BW were the same. Do you want me to increase the overall device sample rate
[23:03:01] <helinox[m]> power is measured using separate spec A
[23:03:17] <helinox[m]> cabled 
[23:03:50] <patchvonbraun[m]> On many USRP devices (B200 included)  the analog bandwidth is variable and that's what the bandwidth control is all about.
[23:04:20] <patchvonbraun[m]> What do you have the RF gain set to?
[23:06:28] <helinox[m]> so should CH0 bandwidth be set to 1/2 sample rate? RF gain is set to 70 with gain type Absolute (dB) that seems to be the high i can do without distortion 
[23:07:37] <patchvonbraun[m]> No, set it to your sample rate (or a bit lower/higher to see if that makes  adifference).  The setter internally understands to set each of I/Q low-pass fitlers to half the desired bandwidth.
[23:08:44] <patchvonbraun[m]> The RF gain control range is 89dB, so you're about 19dB below maximum, and the AD9361 chip only puts out about +5dBm maximum.
[23:10:26] <patchvonbraun[m]> Are the startup messages giving you any grief about your "weird" sample rate?   The B2xx series have very flexible sample rates, because they have variable master-clocks, and DDCs, etc.  But "very flexible" doesn't always mean infinitely so.
[23:11:02] <helinox[m]> yeah no complaints on boot about the sample rate
[23:12:03] <patchvonbraun[m]> Also, what's your center frequency?  The output power is NOT totally flat across the total tunable bandwidth of the device.

[23:12:33] <helinox[m]> 433 MHz
[23:13:13] <helinox[m]> i still would expect to get a lot closer +20 dBm 
[23:14:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> Absolute maximum output is about +10dBm

[23:15:09] <helinox[m]> why do they label the front of the USRP max tx power +20 dBm lol. Still i'm about 20 dB off 
[23:15:50] <patchvonbraun[m]> No idea.  The AD9361 chip is not capable of those power levels.
[23:16:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> Can you share the flow-graph you're using?  
[23:18:31] <helinox[m]> It's just a Signal Source to a usrp sink

[23:20:31] <tnt> helinox[m]: the +20 dBm is the absolute maximum rating. (i.e. it can never ever go above that).  So there is a bit of margin between that guarantee and what it actually does.
[23:21:35] <patchvonbraun[m]> With those parameters, I'd expect to see your carrier somewhere around -10dBm.
[23:21:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> +/- mumbling and fuzz
[23:23:16] <helinox[m]> okay, so if we're down to -10 dbm and i'm reading -18 dbm at the best than we're only 8 db off now haha
[23:26:58] <tnt> What are you reading with ?
[23:27:11] <patchvonbraun[m]> So, stupid stuff.  Are you on the correct output of the B210?   IT has two TX and two RX SMA ports.  The port-to-port isolation is not infinitely large, so you could still see signal when plugged in to the incorrect port.
[23:28:13] <helinox[m]> yup, it's got the solid red light
[23:30:15] <patchvonbraun[m]> Welp, the detailed performance data are here:  https://kb.ettus.com/images/c/cb/B200_RF_Performance.pdf
[23:37:43] <patchvonbraun[m]> You could also try a larger offset frequency.  I THINK the DC offset removal shouldn't affect a 1kHz offset, but making it larger is easy.

[23:41:45] <helinox[m]> yeah i'll play around with it, i just wanted to make sure i wasnt doing something dumb that was making me loose a significant amount of power, knowing the 0.9 amplitude value was good though
