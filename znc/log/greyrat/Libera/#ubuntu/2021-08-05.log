[00:00:56] <Guest94> sarnold Thank you.  You're saying to set up an entire chroot environment?
[00:01:06] <Guest94> leftyfb I don't get a menu.
[00:01:32] <sarnold> Guest94: no, just to chroot to your system's installation
[00:01:48] <sarnold> Guest94: if you *can* get that menu that'd be a bit easier ;) I think you have to hold down the left shift when booting to get the menu
[00:02:07] <Guest94> Normally it just boots to the menu
[00:02:14] <Guest94> No buttons required
[00:03:42] <Guest94> so... mount /dev/sdxx /mnt && chroot /mnt  ???
[00:05:15] <sarnold> Guest94: pretty close, yeah; mount /dev/sdxx /mnt ; then a few mount --rbind commands .. then the chroot /mnt bash -- and then do things ..
[00:05:38] <Guest94> so I have to setup an entire chroot environment

[00:11:18] <Guest94> sarnold thank you again.  I will do these things.  I will also hold the left shift key down to see if a menu pops up.
[00:11:46] <leftyfb> Guest94: can you define "won't boot"? What do you get on the screen exactly?
[00:12:30] <Guest94> ioria I'm not running hwe, but I think I did see 5.11 come down.  It seemed like a large jump in any event.
[00:13:11] <Guest94> leftyfb it's black and every now & then I see the cursor blink.  Maybe every 30 seconds or so??

[00:24:51] <Guest94> OK.  I now have all the relevant notes saved.  However... How & why does the commands from ioria differ from those supplied by sarnold?
[00:25:37] <Guest94> Well not directly by sarnold but as specified by the link sarnold provided.
[00:26:06] <ioria> Guest94, i just want to know what kernels do you have installed and if they are 'correctly' installed
[00:26:12] <Guest94> Not sure how to proceed with conflicting instructions.
[00:26:56] <sarnold> Guest94: it's not a big deal, either one will work
[00:27:11] <sarnold> Guest94: I like ioria's version more since it's smaller / easier / more compact :) hehe
[00:29:14] <Guest94> well, considering I already did your version, I trust it's OK to reboot... as soon as I figure out which partition I was using at the time.
[00:29:32] <ioria> Guest94, once you have a working chroot, run dpkg -l | grep linux-image; check your installed kernels, then maybe a run a apt full-upgrade again ; exit and reboot

[01:59:05] <Guest94> So I was about to chroot to the broken partition.
[01:59:19] <matsaman> if mount says something about 'fuse', it's a fair bet you can use fusermount -u, or -uz

[02:02:06] <matsaman> just mounting the right partition should be enough for read/write
[02:02:11] <Guest94> From the beginning...  I upgraded this morning, new kernel came down, it won't boot.
[02:02:14] <matsaman> but for using utils as if it were /, yeah you'd need to chroot
[02:02:19] <matsaman> oh?
[02:02:25] <matsaman> is your old kernel still in /boot/? It should be
[02:02:38] <matsaman> you should be able to edit and tab complete from the GRUB menu during bootup

[02:03:24] <Guest94> And so, ioria: Guest94, once you have a working chroot, run dpkg -l | grep linux-image; check your installed kernels, then maybe a run a apt full-upgrade again ; exit and reboot
[02:03:35] <matsaman> find your grub.cfg, duplicate the default entry, and change the kernel file name to the older kernel that should also be in /boot/

[02:06:39] <Guest94> Now that you have this additional info ?
[02:07:02] <Guest94> matsaman ^^^
[02:08:12] <matsaman> I forget what just a blinking cursor is most indicative of
[02:08:22] <matsaman> you're holding SHIFT or whatever magic key Ubuntu expects to force the menu?
[02:08:26] <Guest94> mostly not booting :D
[02:08:37] <matsaman> should be able to disable that hidden GRUB menu during boot from the FS/grub.cfg, too

[02:15:10] <Guest94> yeah...  I think I need to follow what sarnold and ioria told me to do.
[02:15:34] <Guest94> Booting an old kernel isn't going to fix it, I'll still have a broken install, albeit just not using it.
[02:15:50] <matsaman> you can edit it
[02:15:56] <Guest94> "it"
[02:16:03] <matsaman> you just have to keep in mind that it's rewritten automatically when you update things
[02:16:06] <matsaman> it, grub.cfg
[02:16:10] <Guest94> oh
[02:16:14] <matsaman> there is another file you can alter for permanent changes, right now you just need to get booting
[02:16:26] <matsaman> so editing grub.cfg is fine
[02:16:35] <Guest94> Right... but how does that fix all the packages that installed but don't work?
[02:16:40] <matsaman> but duplicate entries instead of editing them in place, so you don't lose track of what's going on
[02:16:47] <matsaman> Guest94: which packages don't work?
[02:18:07] <Guest94> matsaman the kernel packages
[02:18:38] <matsaman> the previous, working kernel packages should still be in /boot/
[02:18:47] <matsaman> you should only need to tell grub.cfg about them so you can select them at bootup
[02:18:57] <matsaman> none of that matters if you can't even get to the GRUB boot menu

[02:19:18] <matsaman> but you should try disabling the auto-hidden stuff, holding SHIFT, arrow keys, etc. to do that first before assuming it's really really, really broken

[04:55:27] <sarnold> they may have had a good reason for their suggestion; my suggestion was based on the strong hope that you were 100% right by nailing it down to the kernel packages

[04:56:37] <oerheks> i'd say reinstall

[06:23:34] <alzgh> On a machine with 1 cpu and 4 real cores (with hyper threading enabled 8 cores), when I look at the cpu load averages, should I measure it against the 4 real cores or the 8 hyper threaded cores?
[06:24:26] <matsaman> neither
[06:25:38] <sarnold> alzgh: well, it's not exactly related... load average shows you how many processes are runnable or waiting for .. long IO? disk IO? something similar .. and doesn't really matter about how many CPUs are online to run those processes

[06:27:57] <alzgh> sarnold I'm talking about load average from `top`s first line. Doesn't a "1" in the load average roughly corresponds to on cpu core load of work?
[06:28:48] <alzgh> I mean the 1 minute, 5 minute, and 15 minute from `top`'s first line.
[06:28:51] <sarnold> alzgh: it could also be one process stuck waiting on disk io, waking up, doing something with it, then doing another disk io
[06:30:01] <alzgh> this would even out when we look at the 15 minute average, no?
[06:30:19] <sarnold> it depends what the processes are doing and for how long they do it :)

[06:30:56] <sarnold> it's just one way of viewing the system, and it's not really the most useful
[06:31:17] <sarnold> I think it was more useful on other unix systems but even then, it's a pretty minimal view of things
[06:32:16] <sarnold> for example, when I got a dual-xeon system, I did a bunch of kernel compiles to try to figure out what it could do, and running "make -j 300" in the kernel sources gave me the *best* performance; it brought the load average around 300 for almost three minutes, but it was the fastest; I only had 16 cores, 32 threads.

[06:37:22] <sarnold> vmstat 1 is very handy -- it shows runnable and blocked processes, a rough guideline of how memory and swap is being used, how much disk traffic there is, and percentages of cpu utilization

[12:00:07] <locsmif> How about the bug gets fixed in systemd instead, rather than imposing something this drastic on the entire userbase when the bug report even says: "Users may have scripts that are currently using numeric usernames and these scripts will break as a consequence of this deliberate change in stable Ubuntu releases."

[12:06:41] <locsmif> That's a way better argument, but it doesn't change anything about the lack of care imposing a drastic change which will break things across the board
[12:07:27] <kushal> How to list only the available security updates in Focal?
[12:07:59] <locsmif> Seth Arnold in the bug report uses a Perl example to argue ambiguity. sudo perl -e 'print "muahaa\n" if $< == "0x0";'   .. and then says: " the language sure doesn't help " ... which is highly misleading, since the proper string comparison is done with "eq"  not with "==" and fails as expected.

This is one of those incidents where there is no accomodation whatsoever, and no consideration of cross-distro compatbility. I don't even use numeric user names, I'm just irritated with the flippancy of the decision.

[19:00:35] <ubottu> The crypto/tls package of Go through 1.16.5 does not properly assert that the type of public key in an X.509 certificate matches the expected type when doing a RSA based key exchange, allowing a malicious TLS server to cause a TLS client to panic. <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-34558>

[22:00:39] <matsaman> you might have a rename.ul executable already installed, too, and that's ... mostly inferior to everything, IMO =P
[22:00:50] <matsaman> mago: yes the echo one uses echo instead of 'mv' on purpose, so you can ease into it

[22:11:47] <matsaman> it's (trivially) less efficient, but if you want to avoid having to deal with bash's weird syntax, you can instead do things like: "$(echo "$i" | perl -pe 's/\.aac/\.mp3/g')"
