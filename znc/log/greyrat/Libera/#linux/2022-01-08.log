[02:48:25] <Dagmar> CoJaBo: However, if you're on a cablemodem, you're probably overlooking hte obvious.  Most cablemodem providers have their devices set up to hand a DHCP lease out to the first host that requests one.  ...and from that point on (unless you powercycle it!) it's ONLY going to talk to that one device by it's MAC address.
[02:48:27] <bn_work> lacroix: yes, still here
[02:48:36] <CoJaBo> Dagmar: I can't ping it or establish any connections or anything. Existing connections tunnel thru space and time to bypass this issue somehow.
[02:49:05] <Dagmar> Cablemodem operator incompetence
[02:49:09] <CoJaBo> It's possible it's not ARP, but somehow sending ARP packets reliably has fixed it in the past
[02:49:18] <ayecee> CoJaBo: do you have a device connected to wifi and ethernet at the same time?
[02:49:36] <CoJaBo> It's Comcast, so they suck is a given. But this time, it appears to be on my end :/

[02:50:05] <CoJaBo> Cablemodem and router are seperate
[02:50:17] <ayecee> CoJaBo: does the laptop have ethernet connected? does the server have wifi?

[04:30:04] <ayecee> almost, except the file to append has the same name as the file being appended to
[04:30:35] <Gaboradon> Must be foreach file to it's appropriate filename, not all files to one file.
[04:30:37] <ayecee> if i had a file list though, i'd use while read instead of a for loop with a cat
[04:30:56] <alloy> myfilelist.text is a list of your filenames :)
[04:31:02] <ayecee> yeah i got that
[04:31:18] <Gaboradon> Seems like you already did it like I meant.
[04:31:35] <alloy> ayecee, just my style really, many ways to skin a cat
[04:31:42] <alloy> (hah see what I did there :D)

[04:32:51] * alloy thought he was being fancy using $() instead of `` lol
[04:32:52] <ayecee> fun fact, the < myfilelist.text can be anywhere in the line. maximize confusion by putting it first. < myfilelist.text cat
[04:32:54] <Gaboradon> It happened on a slight network disconnect, edge case.
[04:33:12] <Inline> and clockwise is not the rotation, cause i rotated mine anticlockwise, it's the position on the clock after it got rotated

[09:31:43] <ayecee> not unless you club someone and take it
[09:32:06] <firepup> well last time i looked, the site advertised '$25' so thats why i said so

[09:32:28] <ayecee> Sumao: you can check as easily as i can
[09:32:30] <firepup> you need to account for other stuff besides the computer itself
[09:32:36] <hazeyez> ayecee: I don't think so, I have version 2.5.3 installed already, however I believe the issue is that I am being given an openvpn config file from tryhackme, or similarly offensive-security to connect to their boxes. in the past i have loaded the vpn config file via network settings; creating a new vpn connection. however, it was recommended to me to load the config file via command line, for
[09:32:36] <hazeyez> which all i can find to do so is the command: openvpn3 config-import --config ${client.ovpn}
[09:33:03] <firepup> like monitors.. mouse/keyboard.
[09:33:05] <Sumao> and I guess its not easy to make a tablet as thin client. correct?
[09:33:13] <ayecee> hazeyez: okay, well, consider this part of your hacking challenge then.
[09:33:17] <Sumao> firepup I have monitors so you can ignore its cost
[09:33:29] <Sumao> how can I make tablet a thin client?
[09:33:30] <Numero> ayecee: that last one gave me sed: -e expression #1, char 7: unknown command: `j'
[09:33:32] <hazeyez> ayecee: the issue is that being that i have openvpn v. 2.5.3, there is no 'config-import' command, so i ultimately do not know how to import the file via command line with my version
[09:33:50] <ayecee> hazeyez: might have to read the manual ;)
[09:33:52] <Sumao> last time I tried to attach tablet with hdmi cable, it started to drain battery just within an¬† hour
[09:33:58] <Sumao> so that solution was not workable I guess
[09:34:00] <firepup> so the thin client... will be able to act like a normal desktop right?-

[11:45:42] <lopid> store the decryption key on the encrypted boot partition so it uses that instead
[11:45:50] <tomreyn> i'm guessing blebz is referring to the setup where you have grub cryptodisk decrypt a LUKS container containing /boot, reads a crypto key from there and uses that to decrypt another LUKS container which contains /
[11:46:02] <ayecee> lopid: kind of defeats the purpose eh

[13:47:35] <Nobrem> akoana, I thought that's what you wanted all along?!
[13:47:48] <Nobrem> akoana, you told me because of the first frame being zero I should do 29/30

[13:51:29] <Prutz> another question.. on this laptop I installed Manjaro for example. When I look at Gparted seems that during installation I didn't gave /home seperate size.
[13:51:44] <Prutz> so /home is then under root?
[13:51:46] <akoana> Nobrem: is it intended that there is a 1 second gap between    0-4 and 5-9
[13:52:11] <Nobrem> Prutz, that's okay, you can have /home  in the general partition where / is also.    But,  having /home  as a separate partition would be better in case of a re-installation

[13:53:14] <obvs> imagine if you were canadian buddy
[13:53:18] <Nobrem> Prutz, let's say, you have /home in a separate partition, and you want to re-install you system, you could - in theory - keep the data there and not format /home
[13:53:33] <Nobrem> Prutz, but I would never do that ... to risky... I always back up all my data
[13:53:46] <Prutz> does that mean when i make a seperate /home partition, and install a second distribution this one also uses the /home partition made before?
[13:53:51] <Nobrem> Prutz, however, long story short,  you only need 1 partition for linux to work  (plus swap,  ideally)

[18:45:33] <hodapp_> programmar: Yocto is meant sort of along these lines

[18:45:54] *** Quits: badsektor (~badsektor@user/badsektor) (Remote host closed the connection)
[18:46:34] <hodapp_> but for primarily console stuff, 512 MB is plenty
[18:46:40] <koollman> 512MB is actually a lot of ram
[18:46:42] <mrfb> programmar: base raspbian is pretty small, but I think you are mixing ram with storage.
[18:46:53] <rascul> 512MB is way more than 640KB
[18:47:36] <programmar> well i can't foretell anything tho, and also my program which runs there does spawn over 5 threads, each has an infinite loop but has some delaying which idk, could possibly affect memory ?
[18:47:36] <hodapp_> if you really really want to build a minimal image that has *just* the stuff you need, look into Yocto, but it will probably end up being a waste of effort
[18:48:00] <hodapp_> infinite loops aren't gonna matter for memory, unless you're allocating in an infinite loop, which would be.... dumb
[18:48:00] <DPA> I have a PC fan standing on my desk, next to the cable from my USB-C dock. Can someone recommend an USB Fan controller that works under linux? Something like a small USB stick with a fan connector on the other end?
[18:48:00] <DPA> I want the fan to turn on when I plug in my phone, and to turn off when I remove it from the dock. If it'd spin depending on how hot the phone is, that'd be even better. Is there anything like that?
[18:48:13] <mrfb> programmar: why don't create a virtual machine with 512MB of ram and test it?
[18:48:32] <vanessa> mrfb: the total storage will be same, tho. And I trust sqlite to keep the database consistent.
[18:48:38] <koollman> programmar: if you have no idea how much memory your program need, start by measuring that
[18:48:42] <programmar> vanessa: i did try Tiny core but i am not very familiar with its package manager and also it does lacks lots of tools
[18:48:51] <mrfb> vanessa: just food for thought
[18:49:02] <koollman> programmar: you're solving a problem you don't have. It's generally pointless :)
[18:49:04] <hodapp_> the overhead just of 5 threads is also very small compared to 512 MB

[21:13:52] <hexnewbie> s33ker: I don't know how to disable it, I know that an empty ~/.vimrc does not enable it (and ~/.vimrc is filled with all the options I like)
[21:14:04] <Blondie101010> labrador:  do you understand what cache and buffers are?
[21:14:42] *** Joins: tejr (~tejr@user/tejr)
[21:14:45] <ayecee> if not, Blondie101010 will explain them at length.
[21:15:00] <ayecee> even if you do understand, Blondie101010 will probably still do that ;)
[21:15:02] <akk> hexnewbie: For cases like that I use "divide and conquer": Back up your .vimrc, then delete from the halfway point to the end and see if it still happens.
[21:15:08] <Blondie101010> pfff
[21:15:23] <akk> hexnewbie: If it doesn't, then it's in the second half of the file, so now delete from 3/4 to the end. Etc.
[21:15:29] <labrador> yes,I think. Caches are pages of memory containing data from disk,or to be written to disk. And buffers contain metadata for these and tracks where pages for something is. So I think if a file is needed,kernel checks buffer then collects from cache
[21:15:41] <ayecee> labrador: nope!
[21:15:45] <labrador> aw
[21:15:53] * akk does divide-and-conquer a lot for firefox
[21:15:57] <hexnewbie> Well, my vimrc is not a problem, the one shipped with distros is. So I'm fine with disabling everything, and switching on stuff I like. But s33ker may not, so doing a binary search may help (I still think there are easier ways to find the option though)
[21:16:04] <labrador> I thought I understood those
[21:16:11] <ayecee> buffer is data to be written to the disk, that has not yet been committed.
[21:16:22] <ayecee> cache is data read from the disk, and kept around so it doesn't have to be read again.
[21:16:41] <hexnewbie> You have to really really hate reading documentation and looking up references to find options by binary-searching their effect in the config file.
[21:16:56] <mrfb> as far I can remember / is just key binded to :s/
[21:17:11] <Blondie101010> and there is a lot of overlap since what just got written will often be useful in cache as well

[21:18:13] <hexnewbie> mrfb: That would be substitute, not search? Without a substitute, it will simply delete these characters, simple / does not delete them
[21:18:17] <ayecee> right, buffers might be modified before they get to disk. a delayed write can save a write.
[21:18:21] <Blondie101010> but the point is that caching and buffering allow the system to operate faster in general by balancing the system bottleneck
[21:18:22] <mrfb> wait yes
[21:18:25] <s33ker> hexnewbie yes some things are so easy but hard to find anywhere

[21:18:50] <labrador> wait but this is what I read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6345020/what-is-the-difference-between-buffer-and-cache-memory-in-linux
[21:19:17] <ayecee> which answer do you have in mind there
[21:19:30] <labrador> the first one
[21:20:07] <ayecee> it's wrong.
[21:20:10] <mrfb> I remember it's keybinded to regular expression, but clearly I fail to remember how exactly
[21:20:14] <Blondie101010> labrador:  a write buffer is to avoid many small *slower* write operations
[21:20:41] <Blondie101010> it's faster to write a big chunk than a bunch of small chunks
[21:21:10] <Blondie101010> therefore a read buffer actually is immediate cache
[21:21:10] <labrador> ok
[21:21:26] <ayecee> labrador: the thing it links to is largely bogus too, at a quick glance.
[21:21:31] <Blondie101010> data that will be needed soon
[21:22:02] <labrador> ohhh
[21:22:46] <ayecee> not like maliciously bogus, just half-understood bits compiled from half-remembered conversations
[21:22:54] <Blondie101010> over basic buffering optimization, the system FS cache relies on metrics to evaluate what content seems most appropriate to keep in memory

[22:19:40] <ayecee> ah shoot, our nice polite conversation about fish has been derailed by someone's pet peeves about bash history.
[22:19:41] <OpenBDSM> tl;dr version is: it fails to bring anything over what linux brings, yet it fails to run what linux can. So linux>bsd.
[22:19:43] <hexnewbie> Well, with the existence of history expansion, I'd say the shell is actively trying to make you harm yourself üòú
[22:19:47] <jim> hmm. --pulls it apart--,,, so you have no problem with you posting unsolicited bs?
[22:20:15] <OpenBDSM> jim, here you are doing the same
[22:20:28] <OpenBDSM> do you have a problem with that of your doing?
[22:20:29] <labrador> OpenBDSM, bsd existed before linux,and linux managed to bring more to the table becuz the gpl
[22:20:29] <kaizushi> referencing entierly from history with anything is dumb
[22:20:33] <kaizushi> you have a brain, use it
[22:20:46] <OpenBDSM> labrador, don't care about the history; I live today, not in the past.
[22:20:49] <ayecee> kaizushi: take your own advice before giving it to others.
[22:21:00] <jim> it's that the shell is not protecting you from doing destructive things (a specific command for which, I won't be posting)
[22:21:14] <hexnewbie> The advice is making too much assumptions, are we sure they apply?
[22:21:29] <kaizushi> just hit up, know things when you see them, hit enter
[22:21:33] <kaizushi> seems easy
[22:21:49] <OpenBDSM> shells require configuration/tuning (their defaults suck), that's known
[22:21:52] <ayecee> "i'm used to doing it one way, so any other way is dumb"
[22:21:57] <ayecee> is how that reads
[22:22:00] <hexnewbie> kaizushi: But that requires less use of brain than correct use of history expansion.

[22:41:49] <koollman> Sabinno: it's fine. it doesn't matter to get back a root shell with console/physical access

[22:43:33] <Blondie101010> that can be risky in some disaster situations
[22:43:38] <OpenBDSM> is it really adding any extra security over removing password + forbidding remote logins or setting really strong password?
[22:43:53] <mrfb> or better using a ssh key
[22:43:57] <ayecee> it's an extra thing to trip over when you're trying to make root logins work again

[22:44:35] <Sabinno> üòé
[22:44:57] <labrador> Blondie101010, uhh yeah,that would lock me out
[22:44:58] <koollman> expiring the account, however, seems like it would block more stuff. For example, cron won't run jobs for expired accounts ...
[22:45:09] <jim> OpenBDSM, one way, you can set up ssh keys for everything, then you can tell the ssh server to not permit password authentication
[22:45:11] <ayecee> oh really?
[22:45:15] <ayecee> i guess that makes sense
[22:45:16] <labrador> koollman, wait what
[22:45:24] <node1> Could you please confirm :D Innodb uses Btree or B+Tree for indexing.
[22:45:34] <ayecee> node1: i don't know, i'd have to look at the manual.
[22:45:51] <hexnewbie> *All* processes should simply acquire capabilities and drop root privileges (joking about extreme measures, but it would be actually more useful than many of the non-joke ones)
[22:45:53] <ayecee> node1: but as a guess i'd say B+Tree because it's not an in-memory structure.
[22:46:01] <mrfb> expiring the user seems a risky approach
[22:46:08] <koollman> labrador: check if they are actually running. (root might have an exception, though)
[22:46:17] <OpenBDSM> jim, yeah, I generally find it acceptable, yet still worse than blocking ssh to root completely.

[22:47:11] <ayecee> a guess informed by experience, probably
[22:47:33] <OpenBDSM> there might be a rad story behind that experience
[22:47:48] <kaizushi> OpenBDSM it was a problem i once had moving a server with rsync

[22:48:47] <OpenBDSM> why rsync the whole FS though?

[23:00:22] <OpenBDSM> yeah, switching to postgres doesn't change much

[23:02:04] <hexnewbie> Well, if you create an LVM (btrfs, ZFS) snapshot, and create the backup from the snapshot instead of the main filesystem, the backup will be as good as the database after a power failure, which should be good enough (though you should have dumps, too)

[23:04:06] *** Joins: fikran (~fikran@user/fikran)
[23:04:08] <ayecee> OpenBDSM: in some cases it's possible to quiesce the database, to stop transactions to it while a snapshot is performed, but that's less common.
[23:04:08] <OpenBDSM> ayecee, yeah and stream WALs to multiple places
[23:04:18] <ayecee> i don't know what a WAL is
[23:04:19] <hexnewbie> ayecee: Still, the same as a power failure, or a dump in the middle of a non-transaction

[23:04:35] <ayecee> hexnewbie: yup
[23:04:36] <OpenBDSM> 'binlog' in mysql terms iirc
[23:04:49] <Platonides> you can unpool a slave, dump from it, then repool
[23:04:50] <ayecee> OpenBDSM: i guess, but kind of solving a different problem there.
[23:05:05] <OpenBDSM> ayecee, nope, just 2 stairs of the same staircase
[23:05:11] <ayecee> okay, fair.
[23:05:25] <Platonides> still, if your database is at times in inconsistent state, you probably already lost
[23:05:27] <OpenBDSM> you did a backup, that's like a slice of data in 1 moment of time
[23:05:49] <Sabinno> All backup restorations come with some data loss for busy systems
[23:05:55] <OpenBDSM> you can't do backups non-stop, you do them periodically, but your DB is always online and always changing
[23:06:22] <ayecee> mo' users mo' problems, amirite
[23:06:31] <jim> well it's generally a good idea to shut down the db and any apps that use it, then doing the dump
[23:06:42] <ayecee> jim: nope. that's not required.
[23:06:51] <hexnewbie> We log all major transactions manually, so when we did have to restore a day-old database backup, a person had to restore those by hand
[23:06:52] <ayecee> even mysql has atomic dumps.
[23:06:53] <koollman> ayecee: atomic snapshots (lvm, zfs, btrfs) of reasonable databases are consistent enough to be used
[23:07:06] <OpenBDSM> no, that's just why you do non-locking backups + stream WALs and restoration process is also 2-tact: 1 restore from backup 2. replay from WAL
[23:07:07] <Platonides> what I think everyone does is have slaves with a copy
[23:07:11] <rbox> ayecee: is that like a very large crap?

[23:31:56] <Sabinno> The package manager model employed by every Linux distribution is leaps and bounds more robust than allowing every single app on a Windows Server system to have its own auto updater written by the developer of said app.

[23:32:25] <OpenBDSM> Sabinno, that's highly relevant, that's apples and oranges: you compare updates for a server os (that is maintained in the style of "max stability, no new features") with a desktop OS with a live stupid monkey operating it every day and doing god-knows-what

[23:34:18] <Sabinno> Not in the small-medium business world, where I work
[23:34:28] <Sabinno> Only in corporate environments is Linux more popular
[23:34:37] <ayecee> in _some_ corporate environments.
[23:34:41] <Sabinno> Right
[23:34:45] <ayecee> for _some_ applications
[23:34:51] <Sabinno> Mostly datacenters
[23:34:59] <Sauvin> Huh?
[23:35:04] <Sabinno> I'd imagine
[23:35:33] <jim> and it's a very good bet that linux (set up properly) works much better, and there isn't any purposeful broken-ness to cause someone to, say, buy newer hardware
[23:35:34] <Sauvin> You're saying datacenters favour Windows Server over Linux?
[23:35:47] <OpenBDSM> I have seen windows server only in 1 company, and that windows server was just running hypervisor
[23:35:56] <ayecee> Sauvin: who's saying that
[23:36:00] <OpenBDSM> only in 1 company I worked at*
[23:36:06] <Sabinno> But most businesses want domain services, email, and remote access these days. Windows Server makes that dead easy, and to any business making money, the licensing cost is relatively dirt cheap.
[23:36:12] <Sauvin> I thought Sabinno was. I misread?
[23:36:13] <ayecee> OpenBDSM: how many companies have you worked at
[23:36:16] <ayecee> Sauvin: yes
[23:36:16] <Sabinno> That's honestly extremely odd OpenBDSM
[23:36:23] <Sauvin> I was about to say ... !
[23:36:32] <packet_lozenge> it depends on the industry too. in manufacturing i saw literally nothing but Windows Server
[23:36:39] <OpenBDSM> ayecee, 6
[23:36:48] <packet_lozenge> Linux was practically unheard of
[23:36:51] <Sabinno> I've only interacted with one or two businesses at my MSP that have any Linux servers at all, let alone more than one
[23:36:53] <ayecee> OpenBDSM: then there's likely a lot of selection bias going on there.

[23:38:48] <kaizushi> nah experience all the way
[23:38:49] <OpenBDSM> so even if you have a hypervisor over N metal servers and it is being managed by Windows - most of the VMs there would probably be linux ones
[23:38:50] <packet_lozenge> that's not true at all. i worked with a lot of clients who preferred OSes where they could purchase guaranteed support
[23:38:54] <Platonides> so it basically means you run that in a Liux system
[23:38:54] <packet_lozenge> like Windows or RHEL
[23:39:21] <Platonides> still, what they virtualize ill depend on their needs
[23:39:22] <kaizushi> i had to setup a domain controller in 2019 (Windows)
[23:39:23] <ayecee> OpenBDSM: because of what
[23:39:25] <Sabinno> All I'm saying is that no small business, in their right minds, are going to shell out the requisite cash for a FreeIPA/Linux admin when an AD/Exchange/Windows Server admin is far cheaper
