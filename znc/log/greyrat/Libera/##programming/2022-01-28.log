[00:00:55] <flakland> kWasp, writing a correct emulator is not easy work there might be small differences in how interrupts are handled that add up to significant distortions in gameplay. and also bugs translating draw calls to work on a completely alien modern GPU
[00:01:13] <seepinto> rust is more unreadable and bloated than C, especially with how strict is the borrow checker that you cant implement shit like linked list 
[00:01:28] <seepinto> why people write in it?
[00:02:56] <Decker> so they don't ahve to call free() or delete
[00:03:13] <Decker> because it's too hard to know what you can and can't release
[00:03:34] <flakland> and lets not forget the lack of documentation, most of the work will be spent reverse engineering, or relying on others RE work

[00:06:47] <jeaye> seepinto: "unreadable" is a subjective term. Arabic may be unreadable to you, but not someone else. "bloated" is also an unclear team. When you say Rust is bloated, do you mean the language, the primary compiler, or the produced binaries by the primary compiler on a specific OS?

[00:49:50] <sonny> so basically there is scientific > business > music > consumer software, then there are the companies that make software, then consultants. After that there is companies that make hardware that requires software. Is that a decent overview?
[00:50:19] <apotheon> relipse: If you wrote a game in C++, you could conceivably port that to Steam.
[00:50:25] <apotheon> . . . depending on how you wrote the game.
[00:50:30] <pyzozord> sonny: there is more software kinds then this, where would you put telecoms for example
[00:50:32] <apotheon> You wouldn't even have to use a different language.
[00:50:51] <pyzozord> I suppose they are businesses, but not always
[00:50:53] <sonny> pyzozord: telecom > scientfic, I forgot that one is huge
[00:51:10] <apotheon> sonny: There are other types of software, too.
[00:51:14] <sonny> I forgot cloud / computing services as well
[00:51:17] <apotheon> sonny: What is the reason for asking about this?
[00:51:18] <pyzozord> I don't think it's just telecom though, I'd add entire "infrastructure" category instead
[00:51:41] <flakland> sonny there are many categories, what insights are you trying to find?

[00:51:54] <sonny> I don't know what's going on
[00:52:02] <seepinto> if you used SDL, you could port it to stuff like the PS3
[00:52:02] <arahael> pyzozord: Telecom is, at least in theory, heavily regulated.
[00:52:13] <apotheon> There's also basic platform software (e.g. OSes), userspace software, distribution platform software (e.g. Steam and the browser), and hundreds or thousands of other classes of common software.

[00:53:42] <apotheon> actually, SCADA might be more OS than socioeconomic infrastructure.

[00:54:15] <relipse> yes a link
[00:54:27] <relipse> i'm not asking for any money
[00:54:31] <relipse> just world fame forever
[00:54:31] <pyzozord> but now that I think about it more, it's more like a category for "software that exists to support other software and hardware"

[00:54:36] <flakland> is asking a question about your link more spammy than just posting it?

[01:03:02] <relipse> you guys are really overthinking this
[01:03:14] <relipse> its simple user-friendliness to guess what a url could be without the protocol

[01:03:36] <relipse> you fetch all urls anyway
[01:03:47] <relipse> just use a regex to help detect it

[04:22:30] <pulse> i think freenode disabled it
[04:22:38] <pulse> if i had to guess libera did too
[04:22:40] <pulse> but idk
[04:22:45] <Hash> The list command is used to list channels and their topics. If the <channel> parameter is used, only the status of that channel is displayed.
[04:22:56] <Hash> It's RFC IRC standard.
[04:23:02] <Hash> It's unwise to turn those off.
[04:23:17] <pulse> not really, when it's used to DoS users, lol
[04:23:32] <pulse> it was literally a meme on ircnet/efnet
[04:23:46] <apotheon> Some people like the ability to DoS users.
[04:23:48] <epony> now we have to know that clients wrap around that too, so distinction between the client support and the server side support is overcome with /query
[04:23:59] <Hash> How is /list exploitable?
[04:24:07] <apotheon> kinda like those who try to trick people into entering commands that delete important parts of their filesystems
[04:24:12] <Hash> Or can be used to DoS users?
[04:24:31] <epony> some irc clients may not escape correctly strings that can be found in channel descriptions for example
[04:24:49] <pulse> Hash, i remember it crashed mirc, but that was decades ago so idk anymore
[04:24:49] <epony> string escaping is the bane of in-band control protocols
[04:25:11] <Hash> Poor implementation by a client or two is no reason to forgo standards compliancy of decades.
[04:25:16] <epony> remember SQL injections ;-) that's a form of string escape fault

[04:26:10] <epony> yeah superfluous output on a slow line can flood it for a while or crash the control program

[04:26:19] <apotheon> It's not just irssi.

[04:26:44] <Hash> I've been on IRC since 1991 and have seen quite almost everything.
[04:26:47] <apotheon> It turns out irssi is doing the right thing by warning people.  That's all.

[04:27:01] <pulse> because i definitely remember it
[04:27:09] <epony> also it's not cool to get your text output stuffed with service info of unexpected proportions
[04:27:12] <Sqaure> What do you think about Matrix? Can it offer some competition in the chat scene? 
[04:27:20] <Hash> I have. Doesn't make it a vulnerablity of IRC, but poorly coded clients.
[04:27:23] <lf94> Anyone good with debian packaging / lintian? I'm trying to override something and it never works.
[04:27:34] <epony> so, better clients would have paging or buffer partial show..

[04:27:47] <lf94> I'm trying to override this to be a non-fatal error.
[04:27:57] <apotheon> There's also the fact that, even if you won't get disconnected, it dumps an unreasonable amount of crap to the client, which can be frustrating at minimum.
[04:28:03] <epony> depends, servers are not ideal too, you know ;-)
[04:28:19] <apotheon> Oh, epony said that, basically.
[04:28:26] <epony> that's the user interface reason and it's the most important
[04:28:37] <InPhase> apotheon: It would be a strange 2022 network connection that couldn't handle the output of a /list command.
[04:28:37] <pulse> Hash, that'
[04:29:07] <apotheon> Sqaure: Weirdly, the element.io client for Matrix is actually quite nice, when bridged to IRC, as far as GUI IRC clients go.
[04:29:09] <pulse> Hash, that's not entirely true, since irc and irc clients form "a whole" *
[04:29:09] <epony> mobile phones are sometimes on limited bandwidth plans (uncapped transfer at low speed)

[04:29:32] <InPhase> epony: Yeah, but /list is like one webpage image worth of data.
[04:29:34] <pulse> i don't think it's purely client based, either

[04:48:00] <epony> that automate things
[04:48:14] <pulse> it's definitely useful, it's just that most computer users don't want it
[04:48:29] <epony> and for scripting / inclusion in other interfaces and program workflows
[04:48:30] <Sqaure> Im just bringing this up cause i know a company that has a crap codebase covered by a pretty UI that *mostly* works. I could show a far better implemetntion to a boss and he'd be like : "-I think the current one looks better".
[04:48:33] <pulse> there's a reason why windows won over dos :P
[04:48:58] <pulse> Sqaure, that's because bad codebase with great ui sells well
[04:48:59] <Hash> you mean win.exe that runs on dos.?
[04:49:01] <pulse> the reverse sells poorly

[04:49:36] <phogg> pulse: just you wait, the current trend toward flatter and flatter UIs with fewer and fewer ways to tell where one panel starts and another ends, combined with the popularity of "full screen" programs on phones and tablets, means that a return to TUI will hardly be noticed
[04:49:43] <amigojapan> I just had a dream. I was using some computer at a company which I had never seen before. I clicked what I thought was the start button. And apparently that whipped it.

[04:50:45] <pulse> phogg, flat is just a transitionary phase. ui is a bit like fashion, it changes. things go in and out of style
[04:50:46] <epony> so, a small compact laptop with limited amount of memory and processing power, benefits from lightweight applications and simple textual interfaces (allowing you to get a lot work done faster)

[04:56:09] <epony> the most critical mistake that distributions push people into are, not providing them tools to replicate the distribution release process, and not giving them enough choices and details how to toggle various componentry of the UI they land into
[04:56:27] <InPhase> Hash: Do you use one of those tiling ones that force you to pack everything into smaller windows as you open more things?
[04:56:40] <Hash> I wrote my own custom tiling algorithms

[04:59:16] <Hash> It takes a while to discover all the things you can automate and offload to wm and then never have to do it again. but it takes a while to learn your own habits
[04:59:18] <epony> yes.. indeed, in modern times there are many distributions to try out for the UI and "choice sets", instead of providing that to the users, which is totally the wrong set of reasons to separate distributions (UI and user prefs)
[04:59:20] <Hash> they are transparent to us, our habits.
[04:59:21] <apotheon> I like i3's ability to create tabbed window groups within a single tile.
[04:59:28] <Hash> InPhase: I did not
[04:59:29] <apotheon> That's a killer feature for me.

[05:00:16] <pulse> i'm one of those weirdos who prefers multi windowed interfaces to tabbed
[05:00:20] <epony> grouping and control of groups is just critical functionality on a busy system

[05:00:38] <InPhase> pulse: Tabs are just a compensation for a broken window manager.  :)
[05:00:45] <Hash> I literally only tile windows if I need to quickly copy paste or look at multiple windows simujlatnously

[05:01:02] <Kerr> tiling windows was cool in windows 3.1

[05:02:30] <InPhase> pulse: I heavily utilize virtual desktops, so tabs are an unnecessary extra layer.  It gets in the way, since you can't move a tab to another virtual desktop without ripping it out of the window (which sometimes can't be done).

[05:02:34] <epony> the other very useful idea I always give to people is, preparing sessions and own workflows from reusable components, including UI views and panes, windows and sessions (and servers) and locality with toggle on-of per workflow / workset

[05:02:38] <amigojapan> Hash: how do you control where it hovers?
[05:02:43] <Hash> amigojapan: yes
[05:02:47] <Hash> you can specify coords
[05:03:00] <pulse> InPhase, i like programs like notepad++ that have tabbed interfaces but you can always drag a tab into a new window
[05:03:00] <amigojapan> I rather use a mouse
[05:03:10] <apotheon> InPhase: If you can pull a window out of a tab group to send it to another workspace, that's a problem with your window manager.
[05:03:11] <Hash> I ordered a vertical mouse
[05:03:21] <Hash> Going to see how that feels in my old hands
[05:03:23] <pulse> you can't do that with gimp, you have to choose either tabbed or windowed interface
[05:03:27] <InPhase> Virtual desktops basically give me 9 monitors with the weight of a 1.5kg laptop.

[05:04:10] <apotheon> I use the shit out of workspaces.
[05:04:14] <InPhase> apotheon: Well you can only untab something if the program was written to support that.
[05:04:20] <apotheon> I usually have nine or ten populated with windows.
[05:04:21] <pulse> i should use virtual desktops more. never got into it very heavily
[05:04:21] <InPhase> apotheon: Browsers usually are.
[05:04:24] <epony> with a pointer controller that makes the move to and from the pointing device area difficult between keyboard and poitner, it's going to be more keyboarding time
[05:04:25] <Hash> so I just use the new gui face in gimp and no longer xmonad tiling.
[05:04:36] <apotheon> InPhase: Oh, are you talking about tabs *within an application*?
[05:04:39] <epony> so a special mouse makes you use they keyboard ;-)

[05:04:40] <Hash> I have 36 virtual desktops.
[05:04:44] <InPhase> apotheon: Yes.

[05:05:43] <amigojapan> InPhase: I just keep closing tabs all the time
[05:05:46] <InPhase> apotheon: Right.  But I don't use that either.  I would accept that if I could rip a thing and move it to another virtual desktop with a single keyboard-shortcut press.
[05:05:50] <pulse> 6 monitors, nice
[05:05:51] <apotheon> InPhase: I use my window manager's ability to group applications in a tab group to get tabbed browsing behavior with a non-tabbed browser, and I'm able to send a "tab" to another workspace easily as a result.
[05:05:59] <Hash> so if you don't know where windows are, you can textually find buffers/windows etc.
[05:06:07] <Hash> I'm wanting to combine Xmoand goodness inside emacs.
[05:06:08] <apotheon> InPhase: I don't really use tabbed *applications* much at all.
[05:06:17] <Hash> Or emacs like WM with Xmonad.
[05:06:19] <InPhase> apotheon: The best part of about a virtual desktop approach is the keyboard shortcut speed for rearranging and grouping things.
[05:06:41] <Hash> I have more than 3 mice. Right and left.
[05:06:47] <Hash> soon as I figure out how to do multi pointer in xorg
[05:06:58] <Hash> Moving one mouse across 6 monitors can be painful.
[05:07:01] <apotheon> InPhase: It's stupidly easy to pull an application in a WM tab group out and send it elsewhere, with a single keybinding, in i3.
[05:07:07] <Hash> but if you have one on right and left, half the distance travelled.
[05:07:09] <epony> emacs is tiling most of the time, and stacking on separate frames (what really works) but you can't operate that as a session since it does not integrate with any WM

[05:08:30] <pulse> unfortunately, modern workflow works against this so i need a whole bunch of things open regardless
[05:08:49] <apotheon> InPhase: You can set up i3 to be floating, tabbed, tiled, or stacked, by default.  I keep it tiled by default, and tab things sometimes.

[05:09:52] <InPhase> apotheon: My fingers are so well trained for my current setup that I wouldn't switch lightly, but window managers and gui systems do seem to fall to development pieces on the 5-10 year timescale.  So someday a new system is probably going to be necessary.
[05:09:53] <epony> so the point is, not to accept the UI as is, but to have components based (modular) approach and know each module / component well, so you achieve maximum flexibility with minimum need of nursing to that

[10:31:10] <Decker> and then save the file locally somewhere, run the stuffs on it
[10:32:20] <Decker> heroku doesn't have permananet sotrage - but you have like 500G of temp storage.

[14:54:33] <merijn> You are imagining a causal relation that's not there

[14:56:07] <seepinto> laptop can handle 8 GB max
[14:56:18] <merijn> deniska: Who says it's not RAM or CPU?
[14:56:42] <koollman> first: a game with a modern game engine, does not need to require a top of the line gaming pc. So, that part doesn't work in your argument. Second: games with 'old-time' look don't always look so because they are destined to older machines. So they can use a lot of resources while still looking like this
[14:57:07] <koollman> and third : since you don't specify the game or pc or behaviour you see ... maybe it's something else entirely :)
[14:57:31] <vysn> Normally you would want to appeal to as many players as possible and therefore try and make your game run on as many machines as possible. its good practice.
[14:57:46] <merijn> vysn: That's wrong
[14:57:53] <merijn> vysn: There's is a cost-benefit trade-off
[14:58:05] <koollman> it might look like good practice, but you have to consider the whole 'time-money' budget
[14:58:11] <merijn> vysn: You want to appeal to as many people, as long as the cost is *less* than the *added* market
[14:58:19] <koollman> taking time to make the game run on more things, means you are not doing something else
[14:58:40] <merijn> if it takes twice as much money to support crappy hardware and only 2% of your audience has hardware that bad, it's a bad trade-off
[14:58:43] <koollman> if the game runs on everything but the gameplay is shit or the scenario is boring ... it's useless effort
[14:58:52] <vysn> That's fair
[14:59:06] <koollman> so ... yeah, first make it work, then make it fun, then, maybe, optimize ;)

[15:00:49] <merijn> Somewhat relatedly: The Stardew Valley soundtrack has some absolute bangers
[15:01:42] <seepinto> what if you wanted to make a game for the PS5, but less people have the PS5 so you port it to the PS4
[15:02:11] <merijn> If you're going in that direction you're probably screwed anyway
[15:02:25] <merijn> The most sensible approach would be to make a PS4 game and improve quality on the PS5
[15:02:32] <merijn> backporting to worse hardware is a nightmare
[15:03:20] <seepinto> depends on how much hardware differences
[15:04:52] <merijn> Well, no, because even if it's exactly the same "but slower", you might need to overhaul the design of tons of systems

[21:22:33] <WarauSalesman> laptop keyboards are fragile and shitty
[21:22:50] <deniska> I used bottom of the barrel laptops and bottom of the barrel keyboards, and I'd type on former rather than latter any time
[21:22:52] <WarauSalesman> laptops are terrible computers btw
[21:23:25] <WarauSalesman> they are only okay because they are portable, but otherwise, they are fragile, slower, chonky and not ergonomic at all

[21:24:15] <deniska> I mean, sure, but I was talking specifically about keyboards. $200 laptop has a better keyboard than a $15 actual keyboard would be
[21:26:04] <deniska> I guess a keyboard just isn't a part you can cut your BOM costs much in a laptop. It's the same part they put in better laptops, and it doesn't make much sense to spin up the whole another manufacturing line for making slightly worse keyboard modules

[22:49:48] <wedr> is it a wise decision for me to store a PNG on the server as a Base64 string file, or regret not storing the PNG file as it is?
[22:50:35] <senoraraton> This leet code stuff feels like such a waste of time. Its impossible to solve without looking up the solution, and then once you look up the solution, the rational thing to do is to copy/paste it....
[22:50:49] <ChrisWarrick> wedr: why base64?
[22:51:08] <bnchs__> wedr: store the PNG as it is in the file system

[22:51:36] <wedr> ChrisWarrick, because I'm too lazy to write a brand new function in the code that saves the uploaded file as a binary file, and would rather re-use what we have (saving text file) to save the data.
[22:51:46] <wedr> bnchs__, ^
[22:51:58] <ChrisWarrick> wedr: I wouldn’t have special handling for text files

[22:54:30] <vdamewood> ChrisWarrick: Yeah, that's the thing, it's being uploaded in base64.
[22:54:34] <bnchs__> i would recommend not adding more to your code debt

[22:55:03] <wedr> user51, it is an unusual number, yes.
[22:55:13] <vdamewood> ChrisWarrick: In response to wedr: (unless it isn’t actually raw)
[22:55:25] <wedr> user51, but that's something only the DevOps would know better than me
[22:55:29] <bnchs__> also if your program requires 30 gb, you need to rewrite before it goes out of control
[22:55:36] <vdamewood> wedr: Are you serving it back in base64 too?
[22:55:51] <wedr> bnchs__, We already did a rewrite. Upper management doesn't want to use it since 1.5 years ago
[22:55:57] <wedr> vdamewood, yes
[22:56:21] <vdamewood> wedr: Unless the storage savings are that big of a deal, I'd say store as base64.
[22:56:25] <bnchs__> trying convincing them of the cost
[22:56:37] <bnchs__> it would cut down on the server costs
[22:56:46] <wedr> bnchs__, they already are. My superior is already convinced them since last year
[22:57:22] <wedr> We're in this middle of the phase where, no contracts are signed, and we're aiming to get another huge client on-board with the new rewritten system
[22:57:38] <wedr> the new rewritten system is like 90% complete, by the way
[22:57:39] <vdamewood> I mean, you're basically storing it in an altered form because it's 'supposed to be' in that form, but it's really just data-in/data-out.

[22:57:55] <vdamewood> s/you're/you'd be/
[22:58:04] <wedr> vdamewood, pretty much. I was just too lazy to write a function to store data in binary form
[22:58:18] <vdamewood> wedr: That'a not sloth, that's efficiency.
[22:58:20] <wedr> I just pass it to the already-existing function to store as a text file
[22:58:28] <wedr> oh cool
[22:59:20] <vdamewood> wedr: The real decision is storage space vs processing/developer time. If the space is more valuable, 'compress' it to binary. If the processing/developer time is more valuable, store it as is.
[22:59:33] <bnchs__> are you intentionally making the system as bad and bloated as possible, to make them switch to the rewritten version?
[22:59:50] <vdamewood> ^ If not, why not?
[22:59:50] <wedr> bnchs__, no, the code debt was written way before I joined the company

[23:37:02] <audio> flakland bnchs__ so i downloaded it at one point, then deleted it. many months ago
[23:37:15] <bnchs__> "many months ago" it's over
[23:37:23] <audio> darn
[23:37:23] <flakland> not always
[23:37:29] <bnchs__> you would be lucky if the video hasn't gotten corrupted
[23:37:37] <flakland> scan the drive for file headers and reconstruct
[23:38:00] <bnchs__> or maybe little bits of the video has gotten corrupted

[23:38:50] <audio> i tried using testdisk once, did not work
[23:38:59] <bnchs__> or turn off your computer and mount your hard drive read-only
[23:39:06] <audio> bnchs__ don't know what that means
[23:39:29] <flakland> every time you write to the drive you are potentially corrupting the unlinked file
[23:39:39] <bnchs__> i mean mounting the root partition as read-only (you can't write at all)
[23:39:43] <bnchs__> do it now

[23:40:27] <audio> that's the problem, can't find it anywhere except a deleted reddit post
[23:40:53] <audio> all there is is a broken m3u8 file
[23:41:09] <audio> the video the stream is connected to no longer exists
[23:41:15] <audio> according to reddit
[23:41:18] <bnchs__> there is a chance you can recover the video, but it's gonna be really corrupted
[23:41:23] <audio> i was wondering if they still have it saved somewhere though

[23:47:36] <GeDaMo> m3u8 isn't a video file, is it? It's just a playlist
