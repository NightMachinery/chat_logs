[01:28:15] <johnjay> what does that mean though
[01:28:21] <johnjay> like didyou try displaying an svg and it failed?
[01:28:33] <johnjay> but worked on arch
[01:28:42] <Fernando-Basso> `(image-type-available-p 'svg)' says nil on macos.
[01:28:54] <johnjay> ok. i was saying you should actually try displaying it
[01:29:11] <johnjay> i think you can view the configure line emacs was compiled with if you dno't want to
[01:29:21] <johnjay> it's like if you do M-x report-emacs-bug it tells you the configure line
[01:29:27] <johnjay> and there should be something like --with-svg or something

[03:01:01] <grym> to a second approximation or so, it's valid to think about libera as freenode with a different name, and the thing wearing freenode's name now as some totally other thing completely

However, when I customize tab-bar-format to '(tab-bar-format-align-right tab-bar-format-global) I get an empty top bar. I've checked that evaluating tab-bar-format-global returns a correct string. I'd appreciate some assistance please.
[03:07:07] <Odin-> VG234: To the extent it was needed on freenode, it's about the same here I think.
[03:07:57] <Odin-> VG234: Notably, user data was _not_ transferred, which was mentioned as one part of why things went south.

[06:31:33] <mmarshall540> That sounds like what I was expecting.  Cperl-mode has a "Run" item in the menu-bar.  But it's inactive.  Looks like it's bound to 'mode-compile' which doesn't seem to be included in Emacs anymore.

But when I run emacs on a headless server over ssh (terminal mode, or whatever it is called), only the first word of line with the warning is highlighted...

[11:15:11] <twb> a wonder nine has a slide safety, so if you carried it cocked, it might go off

[11:15:38] <twb> in general it's pretty hard to fire a uncocked pistol by accident, I think
[11:15:55] <twb> aidalgol: there's a game on steam called something like "world of guns" which has exploded diagrams
[11:16:07] <twb> aidalgol: the UX is a bit shit but it's basically OK
[11:19:10] <aidalgol> I think I looked at this a year or so ago and the DLC pricing was confusing as hell: https://store.steampowered.com/app/262410/World_of_Guns_Gun_Disassembly/
[11:19:58] <twb> aidalgol: last time I looked all the *guns* were unlockable by playing the game or paying real money
[11:20:02] <twb> and the DLCs were for not-guns
[11:20:08] <twb> like tanks or hyenas or something
[11:20:15] <aidalgol> Does "World of Guns: Guns Full Access" give me everything in the rest of the gun pack DLCs, is the description misleading when it says "unlocks all existing and future released gun models for 'World of Guns: Gun Disassembly'?"
[11:20:24] <aidalgol> Steam does not make this easy to tell for sure.
[11:20:30] <aidalgol> Cf. "Season Pass" DLCs.
[11:20:41] <twb> i wouldn't give them any actual money
[11:20:44] <aidalgol> I suppose I could try it and if I've been had, request a refund.
[11:21:17] <twb> just play the base game and do the derringer, then it says something like "do you want to do the AKM or the Beretta 92FS next?"
[11:21:50] <twb> it's a bit like world of tanks where playing gives you XP that you spend on whichever unlock tree you want, giving you 1 or 2 unlocks the first day, then 1 unlock every year

[17:57:58] <Athas> How do I make Emacs never ever delete undo history under any circumstance, ever?
[17:58:06] <Athas> (Within the same process instance.)
[17:59:03] <artefact> i don't think you can, unless you have infinite storage

[18:00:51] <Athas> Because I do not trust Emacs to be smart about this anymore.  I've looked at the undo limits and I cannot see why I might have hit them.
[18:01:00] <Athas> There is also nothing in *Messages* about discarding undo information.
[18:01:05] *** Joins: ultrametric (~guru@user/ultrametric)
[18:01:08] <Athas> So I'd rather just eliminate whatever mechanism exists at the root.
[18:01:28] <rpav> dunno, i use undo-tree and haven't had any issues .. its limit seems pretty big by default
[18:02:00] <rpav> you can very easily lose undo to the normal mechanism by various undo/edit/redo combinations iirc
[18:02:06] <Athas> I don't think I'm encountering a limit.  I was making small edits to an 8k line file in c-mode.  Suddenly I could no longer undo.  I have no idea which facility is responsible.

[18:23:10] <Bayes> so in my latex file I have "comment separator lines" like this: `% Section title ---------------------------------------------------------.` What's the recommended way to navigate thru them? is that when narrowing comes into play?

[18:23:47] <Bayes> also I'm sorry I just sent a 80 char long string without thinking twice xD
[18:24:16] <rpav> people tend to care less on irc about long messages vs lots of lines
[18:24:39] <bremner> or rather, they prefer long messagers
[18:24:42] <piyo> Bayes: maybe you can modify imenu to recognize those lines?

[18:24:49] <rpav> good point!
[18:24:50] <bremner> short messangers are cool too
[18:25:17] <Bayes> piyo that was my first intention yeah, an imenu pattern and then speedbar or something like that?
[18:25:32] <rpav> Bayes: various modes can let you navigate by "paragraph" or "section" .. if you only want to _see_ a section, tht'd be narrowing .. sortof like reverse-folding
[18:25:53] <piyo> right. imenu to recognize the line, then your choice of interface, imenu, helm-imenu, counsel-imenu etc.

[23:43:39] <grym> it's always got _a_ fish-like sauce, the question is just from what species
