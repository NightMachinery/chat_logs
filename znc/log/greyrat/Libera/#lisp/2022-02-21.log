[08:11:22] <moon-child> why do you not want to use loop?
[08:11:32] <White_Flame> you need a loop, even if it's not LOOP
[08:11:42] <moon-child> you could use do.  Or recursion.  Or tagbody/go

[08:12:02] <kingofcsu> ok i get it.
[08:12:29] <kingofcsu> first I want to collect all line from file to a list. then mapcar it 
[08:12:50] <kingofcsu> But the file is too big, So I use with-open loop read-line
[08:13:15] <kingofcsu> then I think is there a way to map lambda to file without load it all at once
[08:13:39] <moon-child> you can say (mapcar f (loop for x = (read-line fp nil) while x collect x))
[08:13:44] <White_Flame> looks like you've already written 90% of it.  No, there's no built in iterator for that specific thing
[08:13:50] <moon-child> but why not just say instead (loop for x = (read-line fp nil) while x collect (f x))?

[08:14:33] <White_Flame> I wonder if the iterate library might have something prepacked for that, if you really don't want to use yours

[08:15:29] <kingofcsu> I impl first version with loop collect.  then I thought is that not so functional? can map do it a clear way? so I ask the question
[08:16:21] <kingofcsu> and avoid the total load file to mem.
[08:16:53] <kingofcsu> just like loop, but a map way.   just an idea. 
[08:17:01] *** Joins: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74)
[08:18:06] <White_Flame> mapping stuff is just syntactical sugar for looping
[08:18:09] <White_Flame> build your own little map
[08:18:19] <White_Flame> I've got a whole library of ones, tomake interfaces I like
[08:18:34] <kingofcsu> Ok, I got it. I can defun my own map, with fn param. then use loop collect in it 
[08:18:43] <kingofcsu> (defun process-file-line-by-line (file-path fn)
[08:18:45] <kingofcsu>   (with-open-file (input file-path)

[08:18:49] <kingofcsu>           while line do (funcall fn line))))
[08:18:51] <kingofcsu> like this
[08:19:14] <kingofcsu> this is then no collect version
[08:19:43] <White_Flame> looks lik eit

[14:04:51] <MCSH> Hello everyone, I was trying to get VLM on Linux to run but I had various problems with various guides that I found, the most common for which is X crashing on me when everything starts to work. I was wondering if anyone can point me towards a recent guide on getting opengenera to work, or point me towards any alternatives. Thanks!
[14:05:34] *** Joins: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74)
[14:07:40] <Duuqnd> I won't tell you the solution because that kinda ruins the fun, but I will say that (if you have the same problem I had) xlib shutting down is to blame and that the cold load stream makes for a decent debug output
[14:08:53] <Duuqnd> Or you could wait until (what's left of) Symbolics makes a free non-commercial version (which they apparently will do "soon")
[14:09:49] <MCSH> Thanks for the tip, the log wasn't that helpful in other instances so I assumed it wouldn't be for when X is crashing, but I'll store the log next time to inspect it
[14:11:30] *** Quits: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:11:31] <Duuqnd> Now that you mention it, since X crashes I don't remember how I looked at the cold load stream
[14:11:43] <pl> MCSH: use an old enough X.Org to run it (also, old Xlib unless you learn how to rebuild VLM from source)
[14:11:57] *** Joins: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74)
[14:12:04] <Duuqnd> I used a modern xorg with the xlib that the VLM came with
[14:12:07] <pl> coincidentally, Solaris 10 with Xsun works very well a target
[14:12:23] <pl> Duuqnd: oh, you got a copy of xlib with it for LifeSupport?
[14:12:39] <Duuqnd> It's the version one finds on the internet
[14:12:44] <MCSH> pl: Can you point me towards the source for VLM? I found two and I'm not sure which one is the better one
[14:13:08] <Duuqnd> Both require some hacking to compile and work right so I don't know which is right
[14:13:15] <pl> there's no canonical source and everything is in tatters, I used to know of few places that had a *lot* of patches
[14:13:39] *** Quits: zachel (~zachel@user/zachel) (Quit: Quit: Leaving!)
[14:13:51] <Duuqnd> The canonical source is locked up in what I assume to be a private GitHub repo that only Symbolics customers have access to
[14:13:57] <pl> the only one that works without problem is Portable Genera, and that one is currently unavailable without connections or probably considerable money
[14:14:05] <Duuqnd> From the little I've managed to find
[14:14:32] <pl> well, there's hope that this year a hobbyist license (and general licensing) will be publisshed
[14:15:09] <MCSH> I did email them asking about it, but I have yet to recieve a response
[14:15:30] <Duuqnd> According to Gary Palter (who works at the remains of Symbolics), "At some point, there will be a free license for non-commercial use of Genera and the emulator."
[14:16:04] <Duuqnd> I also emailed them. I got a boiler plate email as my first response, and when I asked for details I got nothing.
[14:16:11] <pl> Mind you, some of the impressive programs won't run on Portable Genera (they also didn't run on Open Genera, fwiw)
[14:16:40] <Duuqnd> Yeah, the ones requiring the interesting hardware addons certainly won't run
[14:16:45] <pl> so there's stuff that won't run unless you have 36xx or Ivory or MacIvory (UX-series don't work, either)
[14:16:54] <pl> Duuqnd: it's a software problem, not hw one
[14:16:54] *** Joins: zachel (~zachel@user/zachel)
[14:17:16] <Duuqnd> Oh, I didn't realize that there were programs that simply didn't work emulated at all
[14:17:27] <aap> s-graphics would be cool to see
[14:17:38] <Duuqnd> Though I haven't messed around with that many Genera programs
[14:17:42] <pl> while a bunch of stuff was recently ported to OpenGenera from what I've seen, no one mentioned retrofitting the bits necesray for s-graphics
[14:17:52] *** Quits: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74) (Remote host closed the connection)
[14:17:59] <pl> aap: S-graphics and related are the main examples of things not working on OpenGenera
[14:18:08] <aap> i know :)
[14:18:20] <pl> oh, and IIRC they also don't work on NXP series Ivories
[14:18:25] *** Joins: johnjaye (~pi@173.209.64.74)
[14:19:38] <pl> the issue is that they have hard dependency on existence of "classic" console display, and the only software emulation of it was shipped for MacIvory using SunRPC to access Macintosh Toolbox
[14:20:26] <pl> so they won't start if you don't have "console" display attached in any form, and won't run on X11 screens
[14:20:49] <pl> (which are the only ones offered by UX/NXP/VLM versions)
[14:20:54] <Duuqnd> I think I remember hearing something about CLIM not running via X either
[14:21:00] <pl> CLIM runs
[14:21:26] <pl> anything that uses CLIM II system and doesn't call outside it will work just fine with X11
[14:21:40] <Duuqnd> I wonder where I heard that then. I remember someone trying to run CLIM and it showing up on the console instead of the X window.
[14:21:58] <pl> Duuqnd: possibly wrong display selection
[14:22:22] <pl> applications using plain Dynamic Windows should also work
[14:22:40] <pl> it's afaik only TV that really fails, or apps that hardcoded console screen somehow
[14:23:21] <MCSH> While the conversation is on CLIM, should I focus on learning CLIM or another (possibly qt or iup) library for GUI?
[14:23:33] <MCSH> I'm an experienced programmer, just not with lisp 
[14:23:48] <jackdaniel> if you wish to learn something new, then go for clim
[14:23:57] <jackdaniel> if you want something familiar in lisp clothing go for commonqt

[14:25:03] <Duuqnd> Also worth noting is that while CLIM is amazing, McCLIM is best described as janky miracle software.
[14:25:09] <pl> CommonQT will also work on largest share of platforms without issue, unless someone resurrected non-X11 backends to usable state
[14:25:26] <pl> (well, commercial CLIM will work on other platforms too)
[14:25:38] <jackdaniel> Duuqnd: wow, that was rude
[14:25:48] <Duuqnd> Hey, it does miracles
[14:26:20] <MCSH> I was under the impression that mcclim was a good library
[14:26:59] <jackdaniel> imo it is
[14:27:11] <jackdaniel> but I'm one of mcclim devs, so I'm probably biased
[14:27:25] <pl> good library, but underfunded might be less rude. People who work on it, including jackdaniel, have only so many hours they can dedicate to it
[14:28:49] <jackdaniel> there are still many important things to improve in McCLIM - that said it proves to be plenty useful and overall stable for everyday use
[14:29:30] <Duuqnd> Don't get me wrong, I love McCLIM, but it's not something I can decide to use for important programs with hesitating a good bit first.

[23:13:46] <mdhughes> Sadly Barski hasn't got his own Saturday morning cartoon series yet. Largely because Sat morn cartoons are dead. And also never taught programming.

[23:17:50] <edgar-rft> But maybe if Barsky had managed to die timely enough, he would be dead enough for Saturday morning cartoons?
