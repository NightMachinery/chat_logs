[04:43:37] <wiscii> right, but in what scenario ?
[04:43:49] <xmb> i code a bare black screen file editor
[04:43:53] <xmb> those be for the functioning

[04:44:31] <lembron> still not supre clear where the Q is, how to listen for Ctrl+ is the first sentence in the docs given you know "bind" already...

[04:45:18] <xmb> i ask here, i dont learn from docs, really, they dont epxlain, i learn by chats
[04:45:37] <xmb> you maybe want sort -h for human readable format

[04:46:54] <xmb> -n is numeric

[04:56:03] <ryzenda> haha, that's fine. I manually sorted it myself for now. Otherwise `locale` everything except LC_ALL is set to en_US.UTF-8
[04:56:10] <ryzenda> LC_ALL is empty string apparently
[04:56:32] <xmb> hmm
[04:56:35] <xmb> set it
[04:57:02] <xmb> im only half aware of LANG / LANGUAGE / LC_ALL usage and overwritings of it
[04:57:32] <ryzenda> oh lol what do you know! I set it to en_US.UTF-8, and now it sorted like you said
[04:57:45] <ryzenda> now*
[04:57:55] <xmb> kk so i gave wrong advise now i know to use more LC_ALL

[05:00:31] <ryzenda> lol actually I made a mistake, and I was wrong. I looked at my manually sorted file, and the 2nd file is still wrong, lol, so that didn't even work
[05:01:13] <xmb> problem: sort <<<$'Air\n.Fail' , returns for me .Fail first, for him Air
[05:01:15] <ryzenda> but I didn't try with C.UTF-8

[05:02:17] <xmb> you can maybe
[05:02:32] <xmb> LC_NUMERIC=C
[05:02:53] <xmb> maybe jump to LC_ALL=C actually for the worst
[05:03:04] <xmb> i didnt try en_US .. btw
[05:03:13] <ryzenda> but also, this does work --> LC_ALL=C sort ertregdfgdfg > ertregdfgdfg2
[05:03:23] <ryzenda> LC_LANG=C doesn't
[05:03:35] <xmb> so try LC_NUMERIC=C or and LC_COLLATE=C
[05:03:38] <ryzenda> I mean LANG=C
[05:03:49] <xmb> and u didnt answer, do u have a C.UTF-8
[05:04:05] <xmb> i suppose its a en_US change not C
[05:04:14] <xmb> cause of such long time i dont wanna set en_US really
[05:04:21] <ryzenda> LC_NUMERIC=C doesn't work, but LC_COLLATE=C does work
[05:04:33] <ryzenda> I do not have a C.UTF-8
[05:04:36] <larryv> lots of just setting things at random going on right now
[05:04:37] <xmb> k
[05:04:38] <ryzenda> but the text is all ascii anyway

[05:08:57] <xmb> doesnt that mean it works ?
[05:09:00] <ryzenda> yep
[05:09:10] <xmb> but when LC_ALL is unset it doesnt ? or when

[05:13:15] <xmb> larry u are so right, however err debian docs ( man locale ) example setting locale in .bashrc ( err )
[05:13:26] <ryzenda> lol, xmb tells me to set LC_ALL, larryv tells me not to. This is why I didn't really master locales yet, cuz I remember seeing these kinds of conflicts years ago too, and eventually gave up on past locale/lang-related projects

[05:14:56] <xmb> but, LC_ALL is not set for me, too
[05:15:14] <xmb> so i might add LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 or LC_ALL=$LANG to the export in that file

[05:15:43] <larryv> your locale should be set up correctly without LC_ALL. usually that means making sure LANG is appropriate
[05:15:57] <larryv> the only time you might want to set LC_ALL is topically, to make a certain command or script work a certain way

[07:03:56] <larryv> there's usually a way to make jq output the way you need it to, instead of slicing and dicing it after the fact
[07:04:44] <tsujp> No, need to use @sh the input is a JSON array, @sh to get that into a space-separated string (the escaping is secondary via the single quotes) which I can then loop over using a `for` loop in bash
[07:05:00] <larryv> and the output is an array as well?

[12:59:41] <isabella> it's loaded if you run    bash -l    which is something that in theory is only done once at login time
[13:00:01] <rendar> ok
[13:00:27] <rendar> but .bash_profile contains `source .bashrc` ..which should be run every time
[13:00:29] <rendar> is that wrong?
[13:01:18] <isabella> that line doesn't run every time, it only runs if you're executing .bash_profile
[13:01:29] <isabella> .bashrc is sourced normally by your shell if it's not started with -l
[13:01:33] <rendar> i got that
[13:01:45] <rendar> but since .bashrc *should* be sourced every time bash starts
[13:01:58] <rendar> why source .bashrc is into some file that isn't loaded every time/
[13:01:59] <rendar> ?
[13:02:24] <isabella> .bashrc is ALSO sourced by bash in normal startup
[13:02:32] <rendar> ok
[13:02:48] <rendar> what are the kind of stuff should be into bash_profile?
[13:03:42] <isabella> idk i think most people would just rather have only one instead of both
[13:03:48] <isabella> it's not a useful distinction

They should *always* be quoted. See: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/073 and "Parameter Expansion" in man bash. Also see http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe.

[21:05:17] <olspookishmagus> suppose there is some output of a command that needs sorting but it has either a "footer" or "header" that needs to be saved and shown after the sorting has been applied to the "data"

[21:05:40] <olspookishmagus> what's a suggested way to achieve this?

[21:12:53] <olspookishmagus> maybe awk could do the sorting
[21:13:35] <emanuele6> sorting with awk? why?
[21:13:48] <olspookishmagus> maybe save the output to "header", "data", "footer" and show them again after the "sorting" has been applied to the "data"
[21:14:04] <emanuele6> that is literally what phy1729 sent
[21:14:09] <emanuele6> oh, footer
[21:14:15] <phy1729> Neither ps nor dpkg have a footer which would be significantly harder
[21:14:22] <olspookishmagus> for example on the dpkg -l you might be interested in the "installed packages" so ... | awk '{ if ( $1 == "ii" ) print $0 }'

[23:25:24] <lembron> "filter" as in modify? no, just the last line as it was just written --- but to then also fix the currents terminal arror-up youll need to cleanup&reread
[23:25:33] <CarloWood> I think a proper solution is more in the direction of intercepting arrow up/down etc to show filtered stuff.

[23:28:20] <lembron> up/down isnt all either, prob also want to have reverse-search (ctrl+r) work correctly, so altering the history seems most reasonable... (as it is relative to where you current terminal is anyhow)
[23:29:11] <CarloWood> Oh control-r is maybe what I want :)
[23:29:21] <ano> cannot replace content on specific line number with var with sed because of regex escape hell, any alternative?
[23:29:36] <lembron> difference then is kinda "turning the two commands into (potentially) the same command" - while the "on display" variant is more "display absolute-paths as relative fitting to wherever i am right now" whats uite a mouthfull more...
[23:29:49] <CarloWood> Ie, I know I want to edit Application.cxx - I am just too lazy to remember the path. But if I type:  cntrl-r Ap   it already shows!

[23:33:11] *** Joins: coc0nut (~coc0nut@user/coc0nut)
[23:33:20] <emanuele6> if new is a variable, be ware that `-v new="$var"' will make POSIX awk evaluate backslash sequences in $var e.g. `\n' and can error and not work if it contains invalid ones (e.g. \xr or \,)
[23:33:48] <emanuele6> you can mitigate this with bash using -v "new=${var//\\/\\\\}"
[23:33:59] <emanuele6> in POSIX sh, it's more complex
