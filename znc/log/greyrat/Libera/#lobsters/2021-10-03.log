[09:37:14] <martian67|> kobo stuff is pretty hackable too, its basicly just generic linux
[09:38:08] <martian67|> has a better CPU aswell, not that that really matters
[09:39:05] <nikolap> I own a Remarkable 1. it was definitely pricey — the 2 is comparatively cheap — but it's a good device.
[09:39:05] <nikolap> it runs Linux, you get root access, and people made all sorts of cool software for it — from package managers to Koreader ports.
[09:39:49] <nikolap> they continuously update their software. it was remarkably underwhelming for a while, but it's fairly usable at the moment.
[09:40:32] <martian67|> thats also true of kobo stuff, at least the root part, and an active community
[09:40:40] <martian67|> (as well as updates)
[09:41:09] <nikolap> I mostly use it to read textbooks and papers, and it doubles as a decent planner as well. the writing experience is pretty good.
[09:41:56] <nikolap> yeah, the Kobo is interesting. back in the days of Remarkable 1, that one didn't exist. the alternatives were the abandoned Sony thing, and Onyx with their *really* crappy software (which allegedly improved as well).

[11:13:23] <amirouche> pinenote sounds good, I guess I need to wait.
[11:16:38] <amirouche> it true the price it rather high, also maybe given the current hardware prices are high at this time, maybe it is better to wait anyway.
[11:17:42] <amirouche> My laptop lenovo ideapad costed around 600 with an ssd and 16GB and I can play diablo :p
[11:18:17] <ignaloidas> nah, the e-ink panel in evaluation quantities is 300$, you're getting a good deal

[11:18:34] <amirouche> price-gouged?
[11:19:01] <amirouche> ok got it on wikipedia
[11:19:30] <amirouche> tho, i prefer to buy at pine64 company that seems to favor foss than something else.
[11:19:55] <amirouche> I read the pine64 wikipedia page, it looks like a company I would like to work with
[11:20:20] <ignaloidas> yeah, they are nice to work with, but beware of the software situation
[11:20:35] <ignaloidas> as there isn't going to be any software at launch basically
[11:20:48] <amirouche> the software situation? does it mean the drivers are not available?
[11:21:17] <amirouche> oh ok.. hmm..
[11:21:27] <ignaloidas> they are relying almost purely on community for the software, and providing the hardware almost barebones
