[17:27:26] <Filipepe> gwern: thanks
[17:32:03] <PapuaHardyNet> so activation functions normalize the activations from a neural network layer so that the next layer gets normalized activations, which increases convergence rate
[17:32:56] <PapuaHardyNet> batch norm after every layer basically... replicates this functionality, except by normalizing across mini-batches instead of using a function stuck onto the previous layer.
[17:33:57] <PapuaHardyNet> and batchnorm actually seems very controversial, at least from what I can tell. while it has shown to empirically improve training performance, the original theory of the authors as to why batchnorm helped was proven incorrect
[17:34:29] <gwern> batchnorm is also despicable because it introduces a huge train vs runtime difference in terms of hidden global state which can massively affect outputs
[17:34:43] <PapuaHardyNet> worse, batchnorm actually enhanced the very issue they wanted to ameliorate (exploding gradients), which makes batchnorm a particularly problematic concept
[17:34:58] <gwern> and is itself a fairly large number of parameters/state which screws with your understanding of 'where' the NN is thinking
[17:35:42] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah! it also makes the inputs to every layer dependent on the entire batch, making data parallelism quite costly

[18:16:14] <pompolic> what are the options?
[18:17:22] <Filipepe> I mean, regarding the formulation. There's alpha-GPC and CPD-choline and some bitartate, that I think Yvain thinks is placebo[
[18:17:48] <pompolic> choline-bitartarate
[18:18:03] <kuudes> I tried to get my fifth dose with a prescription, and was granted an appointment, but then an official doctor intervened and it was cancelled. when queried, she refused to provide an official decision on the matter
[18:18:16] <kuudes> I managed the medical matter through other means, but I am intending to get this matter officially investigated somehow
[18:21:36] <Betawolf> kuudes is that meme with the bodybuilder pincushioned with syringes
[18:24:06] <Betawolf> "We thought it was only a therapeutic, but it turns out that in some people it created a... thirst" - cut to kuudes siphoning blood out of the recently-vaccinated as a way to bypass the medical bureaucracy
[18:24:43] <gwern> 'become ungovernable'
[18:26:36] <kuudes> it is curious they ban treatment the law says they have a duty to provide, without providing an official decision about denying the care
[18:27:26] <kuudes> law on infectious diseases says clearly, that it is the duty of the city to vaccinate the vaccines a doctor has prescribed
[18:28:17] <kuudes> and statute on covid vaccines has scrapped previous preference order of age groups etc, and says that anyone willing who has no medical reason against should be given covid vaccination
[18:28:40] <two2thehead> kuudes, what's your interval between boosters?
[18:28:50] <kuudes> this is related to ministry of health wanting to give people doses they want and institute of health wanting to stop vaccinating
[18:29:26] <kuudes> but the former has legal power and the latter does not have; but indeed it seems doctors act per latter and in ways the latter has not said
[18:29:56] <kuudes> ie institute has made multiple recommendations on when and who to vaccinate, and doctors decide that no one but a person mentioned in some recommendation will get vaccinated
[18:30:18] <kuudes> two2thehead, 12 weeks
[18:31:40] <two2thehead> hm
[18:31:45] <kuudes> I have cleared it with my treating doctor, that I do not have medical causes against vaccine doses, and that they are on net largely more beneficial than potential adverse effects, and I am willing to get vaccinated, and the institute has a recommendation that a booster is given 12 weeks since last dose
[18:32:08] <mst> two2thehead: hello?
[18:33:01] <kuudes> the problem is that the vaccine substance is only on cities and they don't give them to others and also when they have been ordered to give them to other practicioners, forbid other doctors to give them to anyone but who they decide to give them to
[18:33:08] <kuudes> which seems to have no legal basis
[18:34:05] <kuudes> there was a legal basis for city vaccination order in the previous statute, which designated age groups etc, but those were scrapped before christmas, because we now have enough vaccine doses, and have to throw them to trash
[18:34:40] <kuudes> so this is some hardcore level of following imaginary rules
[18:35:16] <kuudes> a doctor prefers to turn away a person crying to them they want treatment, which is free of charge for them and does not cause inconvenience to them as most vaccination appointment times go unused now
[18:36:26] <kuudes> and it seems to me that institute can't have actually told them it is forbidden to give out 5th doses, or they are breaching the law. they have got reprimanded for such breaches of law in the past with covid vaccinations though, so it is possible they are acting extralegally

[18:54:35] <gwern>  regrettably, while copy-pasting, I forgot to remove double-quotes from a URL and it crashed. I fixed it, and then it crashed because that same malformed URL was in the *link bibliography* which hadn't updated
[18:54:44] <gwern> I have also added a lot more than that

[18:55:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> I see econlib and firefox
[18:55:24] <PapuaHardyNet> gurkenglas: hahah yeah I agree with the crux of the argument: (1) collapse, especially non-x-risk arguments for the existence of collapse, are more meaning-making than solution-finding.
[18:56:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: ... oof, that econlib one, that's not gonna work right, is it? That is so faint!
[18:56:01] * gwern is also slowed down since OA only just increased his quota so the similar-links all need to update which uses up a truly monstrous amount of CPU time for unknown reasons
[18:56:55] <PapuaHardyNet> the thread does gloss over civilizational collapse risks though, and that is understandable since x-riskers don't focus much on it. Plus, it is much harder to model complex systems breaking down - such events are like catching a falling knife
[18:57:09] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: probably not but hard to debug before it's live. I assume the FF one will have issues too
[18:57:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh? FF one seems fine

[18:57:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> But yeah we'll have to see it live I guess
[18:58:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh huh I see one of the problems with the econlib one, it's *blue*!
[18:58:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let me go ahead and fix that
[18:58:28] <gwern> yes, the amount of detail in the FF one is a concern. that much detail often means 'blob'
[18:58:34] <PapuaHardyNet> I have updated my beliefs on civilizational collapse as I defined it (one where the majority of states cannot ensure that their citizens can satiate their basic living needs at a sustainable cost)

[19:13:05] <PapuaHardyNet> I'd say it is much less possible, because such events are dramatically less impactful compared to, say, AGI, and AGI seems more and more likely as time passes
[19:14:25] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: Say, do you agree that you can predict that on average you'll find AGI even more likely after some more time?
[19:16:35] <PapuaHardyNet> gurkenglas: yes, the more time I invest in AI alignment (and I can already tell I'll be doing so for the next few years), the shorter my estimations will become
[19:17:39] <PapuaHardyNet> as of right now I'm going with the standard Katja Grace "2060s is when machines can do everything humans can, 2100s is when they are better AI researchers than humans are, 2130s is when it's over" predictions
[19:18:19] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: Then consider updating today to your expected estimate of tomorrow! Shall I dig out the relevant LW post, or fiction excerpt?
[19:18:57] <gurkenglas> Or, uh, you can plug the terms into Bayes' law and the prescription is right there :P
[19:19:24] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, I agree with you there! But I am assuming here that my estimates are irrational due to me being too close to the domain

[19:22:56] <PapuaHardyNet> I have not, actually. I'm unsure how I would even go about doing so. A decision journal? making a mental list of non-consensus bets I made that panned out and did not pan out? 
[19:23:11] <PapuaHardyNet> outside view and inside view are both very contextual terms to be honest.
[19:23:13] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: torch needs thickening; as I feared, FF doesn't really work, there must be a better one out there; TeX probably can't be rescued, I agree
[19:23:44] <PapuaHardyNet> if you agree with feep, well, I am curious how your belief has affected your long term goals
[19:23:46] <PapuaHardyNet> if it has
[19:24:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Right. The torch sadly doesn't explicitly specify stroke width so I'll have to play around with it in Inkscape... FF - aren't there "just the fox" icons out there (rather than "fox in a circle" or w/e this is)?

[19:26:15] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet, the usual advice, I gather, is to think of past decisions (of import?) where these disagreed, observe what numbers they would have put on each possibility if forced to, figure out the bayes points for both hypotheses, then throw away the numbers and go with your gut

[20:01:12] <gurkenglas> did i bypass them in a way that i couldn't have if i was wrong?
[20:03:43] <PapuaHardyNet> I very much doubt so: you did not convince me specifically that I should shorten my AGI timelines but on a more general level to trust my expected future self's beliefs more than I currently do. That has other implications too, now that I think about it.
[20:04:13] <PapuaHardyNet> basically, if I can model my future self, then I can simply adjust my beliefs to be closer to that model
[20:04:56] <PapuaHardyNet> for anything and everything. a trivial example is that I should increase my own estimate of success on this better-MLP language model project that I am doing
[20:05:23] <gurkenglas> (To the extent that your future self is systematically right)
[20:05:56] <PapuaHardyNet> of course. you cannot model the belief of your future self in a domain where you have more noise than signal
[20:06:18] <gurkenglas> 16:53 <PapuaHardyNet> if you agree with feep, well, I am curious how your belief has affected your long term goals <- I work on alignment approaches that work with the kinds of AI that exist today (interpretability) rather than agent foundations, I don't worry about climate change or old age

[20:07:01] <gurkenglas> PapuaHardyNet: Future self might also make systematic errors!
[20:07:13] <PapuaHardyNet> I think that is a very good idea, and I will get up to speed on the relevant literature in a few months
[20:07:19] <gurkenglas> Though it sounds rather hard to do, when you're already aware of them today and trying like at all.
[20:08:35] <PapuaHardyNet> systematic errors, yes. It is a gradient descent where I'm basically modelling the gradient and maximizing my learning rate up until I hit enough error that I pause, reduce my learning rate to normal levels, and spend a few steps doing a mini-batch gradient descent before I decide what to do next

[20:29:33] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: effectively, the thing that'd scare me the most is a pattern matcher like gpt-3 welded to a short-term mini learner that can transfer knowledge from the big network
[20:29:53] <gurkenglas> feep, does it count if the cognition paper is just, "okay here's a proof that this transformer architecture variant is asymptotically optimal at learning polynomial-time learnable environments"
[20:30:09] <feep> my short timelines are based on "a sufficiently large gpt can act as such a mini-learner on state alone, and people are training gpts towards explicitly having this capability"
[20:30:25] <feep> gurkenglas: eh, aixi is asymptotically optimal
[20:30:32] <feep> I'm more worried about small learners than big learners

[20:31:14] <feep> well, that'd be worrying, but I don't anticipate it
[20:31:16] <gurkenglas> (though the constant hidden by the O is allowed to be large)
[20:31:23] <feep> things look like we'll have a lot of overhang
[20:31:36] <feep> possibly already have a lot of overhang
[20:31:50] <PapuaHardyNet> a short term mini learner? so like a distillation of the huge network?
[20:32:08] <feep> yeah, with scary terms like "online distillation"
[20:32:18] <gurkenglas> I could imagine this already holding for one of the architectures we have lying around! Though the proof may inform how to make it go foom.
[20:32:45] <feep> PapuaHardyNet: effectively, I think gpt-3 is safe primarily because it has a huuuuuuuuuge feedback loop.

[21:47:26] * Obormot\Arcturus crosses fingers
[21:47:32] <gwern> not an SVG icon, so the splitting problem remains...
[21:48:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's different/worse actually, because here the split occurs in the middle of the icon itself!
[21:51:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Whew. Obvious fix worked.

[21:57:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: The solid version from FontAwesome is the best of what's available if you want a graphical one. Make it big (and correspondingly lighter) ... and it'll sort of be ok? No worse than some of the ones we have already (like Erowid, lol)
[21:57:16] <gwern> I guess the question is, is that stroke one *better* than just 'FF'
[21:57:43] <gwern> if it is worse, or even just equal, then there's no point and we'll just use 'FF'
[21:58:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Probably it's not any better, yeah.
[21:58:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just 'FF" is best
[21:58:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And I'd make it a sans 'FF', personally)
[21:58:24] <gwern> ok. then I'll delete the svg
[21:59:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Ah, another new quad icon, I see: POET. Should also start working once you merge my fix)

[22:59:33] <ggreer> I'm confident the whole thing will be explained on the blocked & reported podcast. their producer is a rationalist-adjacent furry

[23:03:56] <ggreer> spoiler alert: the judge imposed a sentence of 180 days for an illegal immigrant. yassin's words were ‚ÄúIs there anything the court would like to review to reconsider?‚Äù and the judge changed her mind and sentenced the guy to two days
[23:04:22] <ggreer> he'd been convicted of his 2nd DUI and while on probation, cut off his ankle bracelet and threatened to flee back to mexico
[23:06:29] <gwern> (the judge is definitely condemned by such a switch)
[23:06:51] <gwern> (apparently humans have adversarial examples too)
[23:07:27] <capisce> "In addition to DUI No. 6, he was charged with fleeing the scene after crashing into another car. The fleeing was ineffectual, if only for the fact that he literally imprinted his license plate number onto the other car."
[23:07:35] <ggreer> the footnote is great: "I have told this story to many fellow attorneys, and more than once they‚Äôve had to double-check to make sure I wasn‚Äôt talking about their own client, because apparently imprinting your own license plate number on the other car is a relatively common occurrence among the nation‚Äôs habitual drunk drivers."
[23:07:49] <ggreer> just FYI vanity plates in many states don't have raised letters
[23:07:53] <ggreer> drunk drivers take note!
[23:08:03] <gwern> I'm shocked that it's legible. now I want to see photos
[23:08:24] <ggreer> I had that happen when a woman rear-ended me. it rubs the dust off the bumper
[23:10:39] <ggreer> capisce: IIRC, that story has another bit that yassine edited out. after the 6 DUI guy was busted, he asked "when they draw blood, do they test for more than just alcohol?"
[23:10:59] <ggreer> and yassine said, "yes they test for everything" and the guy replied "oh. they're gonna find meth in my system"
[23:11:55] <ggreer> also IIRC that guy was 1 week away from being off probation. had he done his stupid shit just a week later, the clock would have been reset on his offenses and his sentence would be a tiny fraction of what he ended up getting
[23:12:24] <capisce> why would the judge change their mind after hearing that btw
[23:12:38] <gwern> because humans gonna human
[23:12:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: lol :\

[23:13:18] <Betawolf> what, the judge just outputs a sentence length randomly between 1 day and the maximum?
