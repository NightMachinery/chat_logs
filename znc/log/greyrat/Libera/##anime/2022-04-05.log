[07:13:53] <Sadale> davic, I wonder if you managed to export your fleshlights into PH :P
[07:15:11] <davic> Sadale: I did
[07:15:16] <davic> dont tell the gov tho
[07:15:22] <Sadale> lol
[07:15:46] * Sadale reports davic to the gov
[07:16:05] <davic> Sadale: dont tempt me to do the same for u
[07:16:10] <davic> I think youll have it worse
[07:16:11] <Sadale> haha
[07:16:15] <Sadale> too bad it's legal here
[07:16:28] <davic> Sadale: I believe its legal here tho
[07:16:33] <Sadale> davic, oh nice
[07:16:35] <davic> I think
[07:16:39] <davic> porn however
[07:16:43] <Sadale> davic, I've heard that it's rather difficult to import shit into there tho.
[07:16:43] <davic> they blocked redtube
[07:16:46] <davic> but not pornhub
[07:17:06] <Sadale> like if you get sex toy internationally it'd be difficult to get shipped into PH
[07:17:13] <davic> Sadale: prob, but I was expecting to pay import fees for my laptop
[07:17:17] <davic> but they didnt even fucking care
[07:17:20] <Sadale> lol
[07:17:21] <Sadale> nice
[07:17:22] <davic> the customs just waved me through
[07:17:36] <Sadale> oh wait
[07:17:39] <Sadale> wow I'm surprised.
[07:17:54] <davic> Sadale: they make u sign those customs declaration papers
[07:17:58] <davic> but they dont read them
[07:18:06] <Sadale> I mean if it's personal posession, it doesn't make sense to me to pay for the import tax to me
[07:18:20] <davic> Sadale: you have to pay it if its above an amount in PH
[07:18:24] <Sadale> Anyway I guess that's how the western world works.
[07:18:26] <davic> regardless if its personal or not
[07:18:45] <davic> from what I read at lest
[07:18:48] <Sadale> Here all personal shit's free of importation tax, except for I think alcohol and cigaretes.
[07:18:54] <davic> so I was expecting to pay like 1k eur in fees
[07:18:58] <Sadale> ah.
[07:19:10] <Sadale> lol I wouldn't even bother declaring that
[07:19:21] <davic> Sadale: anyway, when I arrived they just waved me through and I went outside to grab a sim card expecting to be able to pay with card
[07:19:22] <davic> but nah
[07:19:26] <Sadale> Then I'd just play dumb if get caught and pay for that. :p
[07:19:38] <davic> so I ran out through guards to get to an atm
[07:19:44] <davic> and then go through scanners
[07:20:03] <davic> and then get the atm and then go outside and the guard were like wtf u doing u cant go in, and I just said atm and he was like.. oh ok
[07:20:20] <davic> was a stressful start
[07:20:24] <Sadale> aw
[07:20:40] <Sadale> maybe the guard was confused :P
[07:20:49] <Sadale> that's why you didn't have to pay for that... ?
[07:20:58] <davic> idk
[07:21:01] <davic> everything was a mess
[07:21:12] <Sadale> davic, I wonder how they'd handle customly-built computer tho. Especially for the ones that you don't even have receipt for htat
[07:21:16] <davic> we flew to another airport to refuel because the manila airport was full
[07:21:32] <davic> I had my headphones on so I didnt hear it so i was like, oh shit we landed lets get our shit
[07:22:06] <davic> Sadale: unsure, just make sure its the correct voltage. I just bought a fucking grill from usa and bought a re..voltager
[07:22:59] <Sadale> davic, oh. I mean for custom declaration.
[07:23:12] <Sadale> The value. How do you even declare the value for this kind of computer?
[07:24:09] <Sadale> ah. A voltage converter. Yep that's an issue. Some places are using 110/120V. Some other places are using 220/240V
[07:24:10] <davic> Sadale: what is the weirdest for me is having deliveries any day of the week
[07:24:18] <davic> like I have had lazada deliveries on weekends
[07:24:18] <Sadale> That's nice :3

[07:25:32] <Sadale> I wonder if the English inside Lazada is as broken as aliexpress tho
[07:25:41] <Sadale> oh wait what? :O
[07:25:50] <Sadale> That's interesting. I thought that it was a Chinese site
[07:26:13] <davic> Sadale: it is but its a seperate department
[07:26:18] <Sadale> ah.
[07:26:19] <davic> so he was like the boss for all of lazada
[07:26:46] <Sadale> Makes me wonder why they need to create lazada while they've got aliexpress. They're the same thing, aren't they?
[07:26:58] <davic> Sadale: ah that explains why
[07:27:04] <davic> Kinnevik invested 40million usd
[07:27:06] <Sadale> Do they have a warehouse in PH for storing shit sold in Lazada tho?
[07:27:27] <davic> Sadale: they do

[07:29:06] <Sadale> davic, hmm. So I suppose that delivery from Lazada would be quite a bit faster than aliexpress because it's right inside PH.

[07:30:54] <Sadale> ah
[07:30:56] <davic> I think PH Post has it
[07:31:43] <Sadale> Do you guys have consolidation service as well?
[07:32:07] <Sadale> like collecting multiple packages and wrap it into one big packets and forward that one single package to your home/collection point

[11:45:51] <Sadale> wouigehyjwho, are you yang with another nick name? In case you didn't know, I have explicitly told yang not to use Chinese here because we can't read that.
[11:48:55] <Sadale> This is an English-speaking channel. Seriously please use English and stop using any other languages that we don't speak. It's getting annoying.
[11:50:44] <potatoxel[m]> what u doin sadale
[11:51:03] <Sadale> potatoxel[m], purchasing parts for my next electronic project. :3
[11:51:16] <potatoxel[m]> noic
[11:51:34] <Sadale> Trying to come up with a way to detect my arousal level. Hopefully that's not too much information to you :P
[11:51:36] <Mellowlink> how do i explain boomers at my company that opensource licenses are not freeware licenses and that open source tools can be used at enteprises without restrictions for productivity? 
[11:52:12] <Sadale> Mellowlink, lol if they don't understand that, then just don't use it. It's not your problem and you get paid regardless. :P
[11:52:47] <Sadale> Make sure that you aren't linking/modifying and redistributing the open source tool tho. Otherwise you'll technically have to release the source code.
[11:52:49] <potatoxel[m]> Sadale: wat
[11:52:55] <potatoxel[m]> XD
[11:52:58] <Sadale> potatoxel[m], :3
[11:53:32] <Mellowlink> the problem is that standard windows tools are bullshit
[11:53:42] <potatoxel[m]> Sadale: depends on what tool
[11:53:47] <Mellowlink> nooooo you cant install vim
[11:54:01] <potatoxel[m]> let them read the license
[11:54:03] <potatoxel[m]> lol
[11:54:08] <potatoxel[m]> Okay do they have a lawyer?
[11:54:13] <Sadale> Mellowlink, lol I mean what's the problem? As long as you get paid it's good. :P
[11:54:34] <Sadale> Mellowlink, If you're inefficient with those standard Windows tools, you'd still get paid for using those bullshit tools. :P
[11:54:38] <Sadale> So that's not your problem :P
[11:54:53] <Mellowlink> i guess
[11:55:06] <Mellowlink> but the pay isnt good eithet
[11:55:17] <Sadale> If I were you tho I'd try to explain that to them. If they refuse to listen, I'd rather to compromise and use those stupid Windows tools. xD
[11:55:34] <Sadale> uh oh. Then I'd just stick with bullshit tools and start looking for another job.
[11:55:37] <Mellowlink> i can go home or post on imageboards / irc if i finish soon, no?

[11:55:49] <Sadale> huh? I don't think so.
[11:55:52] <potatoxel[m]> im confused about how a company nowadays doesnt know about free software
[11:56:05] <Mellowlink> stupid boomers
[11:56:09] <Sadale> I actually dunno. That isn't how it works here at least. If you work more efficiently, you just get more work. That's it.
[11:56:27] <Mellowlink> its automotive industry btw...
[11:56:30] <potatoxel[m]> Sadale: work efficiently but rest afterwards
[11:56:32] <Sadale> If you're lucky tho you'd get paid more but it really depends on the company
[11:56:34] <potatoxel[m]> c;
[11:57:12] <Sadale> Anyway if it's after work hours of course you get to get home. But if it's still during work hours, nah. You have to be working.
[11:57:45] <potatoxel[m]> hmm
[11:59:01] <potatoxel[m]> Also Sadale they dont need to reelase the source code of even GPL licensed code if they never release the binary.
[11:59:06] <potatoxel[m]> not legal advice.
[11:59:41] <potatoxel[m]> From my understanding, and im not a lawyer, i am a tomato, the gpl only activates when u distribute the program.

[12:00:47] <Sadale> potatoxel[m], yep. IANAL but AFAIK if you aren't redistributing you don't need to release the source code.
[12:00:55] *** Joins: chuudoku (~chuudoku@72.95.253.19)
[12:01:12] <Sadale> If you only distribute that internally technically you only need to release the source code internally.
[12:02:19] <potatoxel[m]> tho yeh my programs i write are usually agplv3 :3
[12:02:49] <Sadale> ah. That's one of the most restrictive FOSS license.
[12:03:04] <potatoxel[m]> yes
[12:03:11] <Sadale> It means that even if you're hosting it on a website you still need to provide the source code to the website users
[12:03:11] <potatoxel[m]> but the restriction is not to restrict others
[12:03:19] <potatoxel[m]> yes
[12:03:22] <Sadale> I usually use BSD license
[12:03:41] <potatoxel[m]> but all restrictions in gpl licenses are restrictions to deal with other people restricting other people.
[12:03:59] <potatoxel[m]> I.e you are free to do what u want except make other people not free to do what they want.
[12:04:46] <potatoxel[m]> Sadale: thats the intention, i want the source to be free software :3
[12:05:06] <Sadale> nice! :3
[12:05:29] <potatoxel[m]> its because im most likely not going to use more nonfree software

[12:51:29] <emmeka> rhymes are determined by the final syllable with stress on it + all syllables that come after it
[12:51:50] <emmeka> in both of those words, li is not the stressed syllable.
[12:53:43] <DunceCotus> ravioli rhymes with loli
[12:53:53] <DunceCotus> ravio-li lo-li
[12:54:11] <DunceCotus> you'd have to strain it but its doable
[12:54:15] <amigojapan> emmeka: Google also says "If two words sound the same or have the same ending sound, they rhyme. To figure out if two or more words rhyme, use your ears to listen to the words as you say them. For example: when we say car, bar, far, we hear that the 'ar' is the same sound to our ears, so these words rhyme."
[12:54:27] <emmeka> seriously, no.
[12:54:54] <emmeka> DunceCotus it doesn't... unless you're saying one of them weird.
[12:56:03] <emmeka> amigojapan just look it up if you must, the final syllable is not what determines a rhyme, the final stressed syllable is.
[12:56:05] <amigojapan> Emmeka by any chance are you saying "lolay"instead of "lolee"?
[12:56:09] <emmeka> no.
[12:56:39] <amigojapan> I already looked it up emmeka .I posted the result
[12:56:42] <emmeka> I'm not wasting my entire morning trying to explain a basic English principle to you 5 times before you just look it up on wikipedia or something and see that it's right
[12:57:27] <amigojapan> Ok so you want me to look it up in Wikipedia now. Ok I will
[12:57:28] <emmeka> fine, I'll just do it for you. "rhyme can be defined as the case when two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical"
[12:58:53] <emmeka> in this case, -oli, but the o in ravioli and loli are different, so they don't rhyme. to a native anglophone such as myself it is easy to test if you say it out loud, which is the result of the quote
[12:59:46] <amigojapan> emmeka: later in the article it says "More broadly, a rhyme may also variously refer to other types of similar sounds near the ends of two or more words
[12:59:59] <emmeka> it varies by language, yes
[13:00:00] <DunceCotus> raviawli, lawli
[13:00:07] <DunceCotus> kinda works
[13:00:14] <amigojapan> Ok
[13:00:21] <emmeka> that's not how you say ravioli...

[14:34:43] <DunceCotus> you rub it in
[14:34:48] <DunceCotus> helps some
[14:35:29] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in Japan it probably comes as a medicine patch
[14:36:06] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: comes as a brain implant
[14:37:24] <amigojapan> Lol
[14:38:56] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: in Japan they like to give ointments as medicated sticky patches
[14:40:32] <MootPoot> ate
[14:40:32] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: hmm I see
[14:40:33] <MootPoot> too much
[14:40:35] <MootPoot> so full
[14:40:38] <MootPoot> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[14:41:22] <amigojapan> MootPoot: in Japan they have a saying "eat till you are 80 precent full"
[14:41:36] <MootPoot> I stopped at 85 or so
[14:41:42] <MootPoot> I usually dont eat more then 70
[14:41:59] <amigojapan> Ok
[14:42:13] <MootPoot> I used to stuff myself all the time but I've kind of learned to not
[14:42:17] <MootPoot> over the years
[14:44:38] <amigojapan> MootPoot: one of the worse things is going to a buffet
[14:44:46] <MootPoot> yeah, I know
[14:44:56] <MootPoot> usually buffet food it not very good either
[14:46:08] <amigojapan> Well that may be the case, but, I am talking about feeling too full after the meal MootPoot

[14:47:20] <MootPoot> mmm
[14:47:40] <MootPoot> I knew a guy who once used to go to buffets and sneak out food in his shirt
[14:47:46] <MootPoot> would bring a lunchbox
[14:48:00] <MootPoot> fill it from food with his plate
[14:48:02] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: good idea
[14:48:08] <MootPoot> walk out with it
[14:48:16] <DunceCotus> stupid to waste a buffet 
[14:48:27] <MootPoot> well, that's not really allowed
[14:48:33] <DunceCotus> fuck em
[14:48:54] <DunceCotus> buffets that allow lunchboxing
[14:48:59] <DunceCotus> best buffets
[14:49:10] <MootPoot> some buffets actually charge you if you waste food
[14:49:18] <MootPoot> so if you take a lot of food and dont finish it
[14:49:20] <MootPoot> they'll charge you
[14:49:32] <MootPoot> they dont care if its just a little left but
[14:49:37] <MootPoot> if its like a whole plate
[14:49:44] <DunceCotus> how would they charge you?
[14:49:52] <DunceCotus> sounds like an American thing
[14:49:58] <MootPoot> when the waiter comes at the end to get the bill
[14:50:01] <MootPoot> after the buffet
[14:50:04] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: they inspect your plate
[14:50:05] <MootPoot> sees your plate full
[14:50:13] <DunceCotus> on the spot full plate fine?
[14:50:30] <DunceCotus> rando
[14:51:03] <MootPoot> usually you pay after you are done eating
[14:51:11] <MootPoot> in the resturants here
[14:51:17] <MootPoot> waiter brings the bill at the end
[14:51:18] <DunceCotus> here we pay before
[14:51:31] <DunceCotus> there's like a $40 door charge and it comes with all you can eat buffet etc.
[14:51:40] <DunceCotus> so no charge for wasting food
[14:51:47] <DunceCotus> or lunchboxing if you can sneak it out I guess
[14:51:52] <amigojapan> MootPoot: that can be prevented by taking many small portions
[14:53:13] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I used to go to a Chinese buffet in America that was 8usd. And was not bad
[14:53:32] <amigojapan> Back in the 90s
[14:53:34] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: oh nice
[14:53:42] <MootPoot> are there buffets in jp?
[14:54:02] <amigojapan> MootPoot: yes, but here they have time limits
[14:55:00] <amigojapan> And I don't know cheap ones
[14:55:41] <MootPoot> how much are they typically
[14:55:57] <amigojapan> MootPoot: usually 2 hours
[14:56:29] <DunceCotus> 2 solid hours of constant eaterage
[14:56:47] <amigojapan> MootPoot: the price depends on the kind of food. But I think they are typically about 50usd per person
[14:57:24] <MootPoot> you can eat a LOT in 2 hours
[14:57:32] <MootPoot> if you do it slowly and chew really well
[14:58:13] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they often also have an option for all you can drink alcohol for 20 extra dollars
[14:58:41] <DunceCotus> just set up a trough and pour various foods into it
[14:59:45] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: use a fake mouth than outs food in a doggy bag

[15:02:38] <lastonestanding> no
[15:02:55] <lastonestanding> this was an event on reddit
[15:02:59] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: then not very original
[15:03:03] <lastonestanding> users could place pixels
[15:03:22] <lastonestanding> no?
[15:03:34] <amigojapan> Looks like the million dollar web page
[15:03:53] <amigojapan> Which is from the 90s
[15:03:53] <lastonestanding> but this is only a static image
[15:04:02] <lastonestanding> the user had to fight for the pixels
[15:04:08] <lastonestanding> the users
[15:04:22] <amigojapan> I see. How did they fight?
[15:04:31] <DunceCotus> its.. glorious
[15:05:20] <lastonestanding> you could change the color of a pixel and then you got a timeout for some seconds
[15:05:32] <lastonestanding> and now imagine when many many many users do that
[15:05:51] <DunceCotus> pain is the game

[17:20:19] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: only clips here and there
[17:20:30] <Sadale> Zoidberg, basically you attach a flexible tube to the sensor. Then it'll output an analog voltage.
[17:20:52] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: oh you spoiled it! It's a fantastic show!
[17:21:20] <Zoidberg> Sadale: this is funny, is that sensitive enough for butt cheeks pressure?
[17:21:21] <amigojapan> Zoidberg and you would like it cause some parts are comedy
[17:22:06] <Zoidberg> amigojapan: is it a show or film?
[17:22:12] <Sadale> Zoidberg, dunno. That's why I'm gonna test that. Someone else has successfully build that using this setup tho.
[17:22:27] <ezekielnoob> Sadale awesome where he's been
[17:22:27] <amigojapan> Film Zoidberg , with Jim Carrey
[17:22:50] <Zoidberg> ah nice amigojapan 
[17:22:57] <Sadale> Zoidberg, I decided not to purchase an inflatable butt plug for now because I don't have the space for that. Instead, I'm gonna try finding a way to create a pressure chamber using my existing prostate massager.
[17:23:29] <amigojapan> Zoidberg: I suggest you watch that one
[17:23:34] <Zoidberg> Sadale: improvisation, you're being an engineer
[17:23:41] <Zoidberg> nice Sadale 
[17:23:55] <Zoidberg> sure amigojapan 
[17:23:59] <Sadale> Zoidberg, My current prostate massager has a bullet vibrator inside that can be taken out. I'm thinking if I could print a 3D part that acts as a lid of the air chamber. Then I just attach the tube to the lid on one end, and the other end to the pressure sensor.
[17:24:10] <amigojapan> Ty zoidberg 
[17:24:35] <Sadale> So I take out the bullet vibrator, put in a 3D printed lid with the tube on it. Hopefully there won't be any air leakage.
[17:25:28] <Zoidberg> it seems like it should work Sadale 
[17:25:36] <Urchin[emacs]> afaik, 3D printed stuff aren't great air seals
[17:25:40] <Sadale> I think so too. Let's see.
[17:25:51] <Sadale> Urchin[emacs], agreed. That's what I'm worried about. I'll try using a higher wall thickness to mitigate that

[17:26:37] <DunceCotus> or "Under the Dome" rather
[17:26:43] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: thanks. I would like to rewatche it
[17:26:47] <Urchin[emacs]> Sadale: maybe manually epoxying around the basic shape, or something along those lines and installing O-rings would work..
[17:26:50] <Zoidberg> Sadale: can't you find one in market or make changes to one close to
[17:27:09] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I think if its a sim its crafty when it comes to 'edges'
[17:27:15] <Sadale> Zoidberg, ah. Not sure on if I could find anything of that kind. I could keep looking for it tho.
[17:27:37] <Sadale> Zoidberg, The main problem is that the lid need a hole so that I could attach the tube to it.
[17:27:50] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I remember walking randomly in my city in a place I never go to, and it was like the buildings were looping

[17:29:07] <JesseDesu> almost 6am here
[17:29:20] <DunceCotus> like at a certain point I was actually walking on the spot, but the scenery was still going by
[17:29:35] <Sadale> If it isn't airtight, I dunno. Maybe I could, insert a layer of balloon to coat the 3D printed part? That's because balloon is air-tight.
[17:29:37] <DunceCotus> very holodeck sorta thing
[17:31:16] <Zoidberg> Sadale: not that hard to make a hole. The main problem would be weird shape of the lid or not the standard dimension.
[17:31:25] <Sadale> yep :/
[17:32:12] <Sadale> or I could get someone to 3D print the same part that I've designed using SLA technology. SLA parts should be air-tight AFAIK
[17:32:17] <Zoidberg> Sadale: you can go to one of those hardware workshops or welding workshops for hole

[17:33:18] <Sadale> Actually it doesn't have to be perfectly air-tight. It just has to be good enough so that the contraction would be detected by the sensor

[19:03:31] <JesseDesu> "Bob's your uncle" is a phrase commonly used in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries that means "and there it is" or "and there you have it" or "It's done". Typically, someone says it to conclude a set of simple instructions or when a result is reached. The meaning is similar to that of the French expression "et voilà!" or the American "easy as pie" or "piece of cake".

[19:17:13] <JesseDesu> ?
[19:17:13] <Jigsy> JesseDesu: I ended up having to do the laundry because my Mom told me I needed too.
[19:17:21] <Jigsy> It was so nice having the house to myself, though.
[19:17:27] <JesseDesu> you own a house
[19:17:32] <Jigsy> No.
[19:17:37] <Jigsy> Mom was away for a week.
[19:17:53] <JesseDesu> you're not a MAN until you own your own HOUSE
[19:18:06] <Jigsy> House prices in the UK are insane.
[19:18:10] <JesseDesu> i'm still a man child
[19:18:11] <bxgelsan> oh god
[19:18:13] <Jigsy> Like, £500,000 insane.
[19:18:17] <bxgelsan> metokur is live
[19:18:22] <bxgelsan> cancer man still lives
[19:18:26] <JesseDesu> !c  £500,000 to usd
[19:18:27] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: I don't know.
[19:18:32] <JesseDesu> !c £500,000 to usd
[19:18:33] <ImoutoBot> JesseDesu: I don't know.
[19:18:41] <Jigsy> 655,750.
[19:18:54] <Jigsy> !c 500,000 gbp to usd
[19:18:55] <ImoutoBot> Jigsy: I don't know.
[19:18:56] <JesseDesu> 655 sutter was the dorm i was in 2005
[19:19:06] <JesseDesu> a lot of nice memories that dorm
[19:19:09] <JesseDesu> it was coed
[19:19:20] <JesseDesu> art school
[19:19:26] <Jigsy> I believe most people in the UK have given up on owning their own home at this point.
[19:20:13] <MootPoot> Jigsy: I'm not even in the UK and I'm in the same camp
[19:20:14] <MootPoot> lol
[19:20:25] <MootPoot> average home price here is 815k or something 
[19:20:34] <JesseDesu> i want to build a model airplane with the wheel bay gear doors up but that will scratch the paint if i set it down
[19:20:35] <MootPoot> maybe 700k GBP
[19:20:45] <Jigsy> Yeah.
[19:20:52] <Jigsy> And the people who keep buying them are landlords.
[19:20:56] <Jigsy> (Aka. Politicians)
[19:20:59] <MootPoot> corps*
[19:21:08] <MootPoot> almost all the new buys are corps
[19:21:25] <Jigsy> I mean, sure I'm nearly 35 and still live with Mom.
[19:21:33] <Jigsy> But moving out at this point would be a dumb move.
[19:21:35] <MootPoot> There was a article about a "small time landowner" who has such a hard time with new regulations
[19:21:37] <Jigsy> As this house has no mortgage.
[19:21:45] <MootPoot> this guy admitting to owning over 100 properties
[19:22:10] <Jigsy> Sadly Mom is one of those people who still thinks house prices are £50,000.
[19:22:17] <MootPoot> that's a easy fix
[19:22:26] <MootPoot> just sit her down in front of a computer for a bit
[19:22:34] <MootPoot> my parents changed their take real quick
[19:22:39] <Jigsy> MootPoot: I've wasted enough time tilting at that windmill.
[19:22:50] <Jigsy> She also doesn't believe in timezones.
[19:22:57] <Jigsy> So, yeah, I'm not going to waste my time trying. :P

[19:24:17] <Jigsy> "Did you know you could be talking to child molesters?"

[19:59:09] <analoq> just thought you might have an not so standard (i.e. gamer) build
[19:59:23] <MootPoot> nah
[19:59:36] <MootPoot> 3080 , 64g ram, 5800x
[19:59:37] <analoq> someone here had one of those power9 pc's

[19:59:49] <MootPoot> etc
[20:00:04] <MootPoot> add in a lot of SSDs and top of the line HDDs
[20:00:06] <analoq> ah ok. doesnt sound too crazy
[20:00:16] <MootPoot> 5900x*
[20:00:18] <MootPoot> not 5800
[20:00:37] <MootPoot> I couldn't really justify the price of a 5950x tbh
[20:00:55] <MootPoot> maybe if I had everything on one pc then sure
[20:00:57] <MootPoot> VMs
[20:01:04] <analoq> the whole 5000 pricing is a joke imho

[20:06:12] <MootPoot> tbh there is a little regret on not getting a 5950x

[20:06:37] <MootPoot> maybe I could squeeze a few more years out of the system if I had that
[20:06:46] <analoq> are you planing to buy the top tier cpu next release again?
[20:06:50] <MootPoot> nah
[20:06:56] <MootPoot> I'll upgrade gpus as I can
[20:07:00] <analoq> then you chose wisely :p
[20:07:14] <MootPoot> I plan to upgrade gpus every time a new/better one is there
[20:07:19] <analoq> if you dont upgrade frequently you shouldnt buy highend. i do as well, but it's retarded
[20:07:26] <MootPoot> but for the rest I'm gonna hang on for maybe 5-6 years
[20:07:44] <MootPoot> I doubt a 5900x will be garbage in 5 years
[20:07:55] <analoq> it's just more efficient to buy a little cheaper and upgrade a year earlier
[20:08:03] <analoq> it wont be.
[20:08:13] <analoq> but some midrange cpu for 200eur will probably trump it
[20:08:19] <MootPoot> mmm
[20:08:36] <MootPoot> as long as it still works for my games and programs I'm happy
[20:08:45] <MootPoot> usually I need more gpu beef then cpu anyways
[20:08:54] <analoq> im still on a 4790k, no issues in games what so ever :P
[20:09:10] <MootPoot> I was bottlenecking hard on a r5 2600
[20:09:17] <MootPoot> I run a LOT of other programs
[20:09:24] <MootPoot> hence the 64gb ram
[20:09:37] <analoq> i probably am bottlenecked in apex legends as well by my cpu...but it's a 120fps bottleneck sooo... :D
[20:09:56] <MootPoot> mine was bottlenecking in just normal use
[20:09:57] <MootPoot> lol
[20:10:40] <analoq> next upgrades gonna be the epitome of stinginess. some 80eur mainboard and 180eur cpu :D
[20:11:03] <analoq> and then i'll upgrade 4-5years later instead of 6-7
[20:11:13] <MootPoot> tbh in 5-6 years with chiplet tech just getting popular
[20:11:36] <MootPoot> I imagine that 16 or 20 core chips would be available for the same price
[20:11:40] <MootPoot> as I paid for my 12
[20:11:55] <analoq> i think we will run into a core count wall pretty soon
[20:12:05] <analoq> i don't think 16+ is going to be mainstream anytime soon
[20:12:16] <MootPoot> sure, I mean more like availablity
[20:12:19] <MootPoot> not need
[20:12:40] <MootPoot> I doubt 12 core chips are gonna be common anytime soon either
[20:12:47] <MootPoot> 6 is plenty for almost everyone
[20:12:58] <MootPoot> just for prosumers
[20:13:01] <analoq> yeah
[20:15:13] <MootPoot> I dont like the direction the gpu market is going towards ultra high power cards
[20:15:20] <MootPoot> 500w+ for a 3090 ti
[20:15:55] <MootPoot> This is a time in which we should be caring about energy efficiency 
[20:16:28] <MootPoot> a 1080p144 card that can do it in 50w is a lot better imo then a 4k 144 in 500
[20:17:40] <analoq> gl with that :D im paying 35cents/kwh and i dont give a fuck
[20:17:48] <MootPoot> damn
[20:17:53] <MootPoot> I pay 15
[20:18:02] <MootPoot> and I'm still wondering how to reduce
[20:18:09] <analoq> they increased my electricity by 5cents this year :D
[20:18:46] <analoq> i dont burn electricity needlessly and my usage is tiny anyways
[20:19:04] <analoq> i need like 1800kwh/year
[20:19:28] <MootPoot> damn

[22:29:39] <Zoidberg> emmeka: is it like honey?
[22:30:03] <emmeka> Bco1981 no. it's high in sugar. it doesn't usually freeze, or, you get a thin ice layer at the surface which you can discard
[22:30:30] <emmeka> Zoidberg sap isn't. Straight maple sap is a slightly sweet mineral-y liquid, you have to boil it down a lot to get it to syrup concentration.
[22:30:50] <Zoidberg> nice
[22:31:02] <JesseDesu> why do trees make it
[22:32:02] <Zoidberg> probably because it needs nutrients JesseDesu 
[22:33:15] <emmeka> JesseDesu because they're deciduous trees. Leaves send all their sugars to their roots before they drop their leaves, then move the sugar up in spring when they need to grow new leaves. Also, they use this same flow to transport minerals from the soil to the leaves, and generally move water to the leaves.

[22:35:33] <Zoidberg> lol
[22:36:06] <emmeka> Zoidberg maple sap is anywhere from 1-5% sugar content depending on the time in the season (sap runs have highest sugar content early, and then it weakens with time, this is how you get different grades of maple syrup), you have to boil it to a minimum of 66% sugar to attain proper stable syrup.

[22:42:20] <JesseDesu> they're cheap asf
[22:42:29] <JesseDesu> considering the battery is universal
[22:43:02] <emmeka> Matt|home import the PDF into GIMP, then export it again as a pdf
[22:43:10] <emmeka> tedious, but it'll work
[22:43:26] <JesseDesu> gimp blows
[22:43:47] <MootPoot> emmeka: TLDR my problem is that coax splitters are killing my reliability of my connection to my isp
[22:43:49] <JesseDesu> i couldnt figure out how something on it that i know how to do in photoshop in 2 seconds
[22:43:51] <emmeka> it'll do for adding text overtop of a pdf, and I'm assuming they don't have anything better, JesseDesu
[22:43:56] <JesseDesu> therefore it blows
[22:44:01] <MootPoot> and I need those splitters for my network to wurk
[22:44:13] <Bco1981> replace with cat6e
[22:44:22] <JesseDesu> like, how do  you unselect a floating selection
[22:44:33] <JesseDesu> fucking takes 0.2 seconds in photoshop
[22:44:44] <JesseDesu> in gimp i couldnt find it for the life of me
[22:44:47] <MootPoot> yeah....I'd have to wire that down 4 floors
[22:45:15] <Bco1981> best solution
[22:45:45] <JesseDesu> the mindset of the gimp programmers was "lets make this hard as possible for anyone used to photoshop"
[22:47:55] <emmeka> like there's no easy way to do this, you have to remove a drywall panel, run the cable, drill through the ceiling and floor joist, put drywall back & mud & sand, probably repaint the whole room... and then in your case do this 3-4 more times.
[22:48:37] <MootPoot> The only saving grace is that there is a coax cable that already goes all the way down there
[22:48:46] <JesseDesu> what is the density of drywall
[22:48:49] <MootPoot> correct starting and finishing point
[22:48:54] <JesseDesu> is it similar to wood
[22:48:57] <JesseDesu> chipboard
[22:49:01] <emmeka> MootPoot oh. then it's possible.
[22:49:18] <JesseDesu> plaster of paris?
[22:49:32] <MootPoot> is there a way to just tie one side of my eth to the coax and just push it through
[22:49:38] <MootPoot> till it comes out the other side
[22:49:38] <emmeka> yes.
[22:49:45] <emmeka> more like pull it through
[22:50:02] <MootPoot> uhh...how
[22:50:15] <MootPoot> I'd have to get something else all the way up to pull it through
[22:50:41] <Bco1981> i would make 3 seperate cables
[22:51:10] <Bco1981> and switches inbetween
[22:51:24] <Bco1981> a switch on each floor
[22:51:26] <emmeka> the coax is already there. get your cable, no plug-ins, straight cable. Do something ridiculous like jb weld it to the fucking coax. go downstairs. pull.
[22:51:43] <Bco1981> ^
[22:52:07] <MootPoot> so I use the coax to pull it down?
[22:52:11] <Bco1981> yes
[22:52:12] <emmeka> that'd be the way
[22:52:19] <MootPoot> so I lose the coax then
[22:52:27] <emmeka> well, do you need the coax
[22:52:30] <MootPoot> yes
[22:52:37] <Bco1981> why ?
[22:52:57] <emmeka> ok then you're screwed. likely whatever holes are drilled through the joist are just big enough to fit unheaded coax cable snuggly
[22:53:07] <Bco1981> modem placed at coax entry of house. cat6e from there.
[22:53:17] <emmeka> there's no way to run it without replacing the coax *or* redoing drywall
[22:53:28] <MootPoot> shite
[22:53:39] <MootPoot> can we have spider robots that run though the walls and drag cable
[22:54:03] <lastonestanding> why cable when there is wifi?
[22:54:09] <emmeka> unless mom & dad are ok with cable runs down the walls of their house just sitting there on the wall
[22:54:12] <MootPoot> why car when you can walk
[22:54:21] <Bco1981> lastonestanding: wifi is for phones and tables
[22:54:25] <Bco1981> tablets*
[22:54:30] <emmeka> wifi is for me to poop on
[22:55:01] <Bco1981> laptops, ONLY!... if there is not a cable that can reach.
[22:55:15] <MootPoot> seems like I have 2 other options
[22:55:17] <lastonestanding> ever heard of the new wifi 6?

[22:55:42] <emmeka> <MootPoot> can we have spider robots that run though the walls and drag cable -- whatever holes through the joist were drilled are probably *just* big enough to snuggly fit coax, not even big enough to pull the connector through. You need to get a drill in there, and to do that, drywall must be removed.
[22:55:53] <Zoidberg> real men use edge
[22:55:54] <Zoidberg> :p
[22:55:55] <Zoidberg> lol
[22:55:56] <lastonestanding> you talk about coax... and it talk ax!
[22:55:59] <lastonestanding> 802.11 ax
[22:56:05] <emmeka> it's not like there's a gaping hole in your floor joists for 1 coax cable
[22:56:10] <MootPoot> I already have ax...it dosen't come close to coax
[22:56:12] <Zoidberg> EDGE!!
[22:56:13] <MootPoot> eth*
[22:56:18] <Zoidberg> Bco1981: remember edge?
[22:56:21] <Bco1981> yes
[22:56:23] <lastonestanding> no?
[22:56:29] <Bco1981> also wap
[22:56:43] <Zoidberg> oh yeah
[22:57:27] <Zoidberg> alright I am pumped up
[22:57:27] <emmeka> MootPoot so, choose. But I mean test this first. Take off all the plates or whatever is connecting it, and see if that coax can even budge
[22:57:33] <Zoidberg> time for some action
[22:57:41] <Zoidberg> get some shit done
[22:57:44] <emmeka> they might've done something annoying like secure it to a wall stud somewhere
[22:58:08] <Bco1981> getting rid of that coax will make you happier.
[22:58:37] <MootPoot> The core problem is that my modem's upstream is too weak

[22:59:04] <MootPoot> I use MoCa = eth over coax to get a wired connection throughout the house
[22:59:07] <MootPoot> since coax is prewired
[22:59:07] <emmeka> just gotta learn from me. less house... less problems?
[22:59:12] <MootPoot> emmeka: fair
[22:59:21] <MootPoot> but for me its this house or no house
[22:59:39] <Bco1981> MootPoot: isn't the modem at the coax entry point in the house ?
[22:59:43] <MootPoot> Bco1981: no
[22:59:47] <Bco1981> that's a problem
[22:59:50] <MootPoot> its 4 floors up
[23:00:14] <emmeka> my house is just story and a half and the second story is literally 2 bedrooms that I don't need, and 1's a storage room, the other's basically a... plant room
[23:00:16] <MootPoot> since my router/AP is also up
[23:00:23] <MootPoot> and I need that router/AP up
[23:00:28] <MootPoot> since all the devices are also up
[23:00:31] <MootPoot> and that is the good AP
[23:00:38] <emmeka> everything is main floor, and the basement is unfinished so the floorboards are exposed and I can run anything through the floor
[23:00:51] <MootPoot> there is only coax going up- although I have 2 lines I can exploit afaik
[23:00:59] <Bco1981> modem max 6 feet from coax entry point in house
[23:01:13] <emmeka> good news is if I ever become a paraplegic I won't have to move
[23:01:32] <MootPoot> didnt you almost do that when you got hit on your bicycle
[23:01:47] <emmeka> you're probably thinking of someone else
[23:01:52] <MootPoot> no
[23:01:53] <MootPoot> you
[23:02:11] <emmeka> I haven't ridden a bicycle as my main vehicle since I was a teenager, long before I knew you
[23:02:17] <MootPoot> or
[23:02:22] <MootPoot> well you got hit by something
[23:02:27] <MootPoot> and broke many things
[23:02:34] <MootPoot> may not have been on a bicycle
[23:02:42] <emmeka> ah, yes. I lost a fight with a injection mold tool dye in an automotive factory
[23:02:50] <emmeka> at the age of 19
[23:02:59] <emmeka> and broke 13 bones in my leg
[23:03:55] <lastonestanding> I never broke any bone
[23:04:00] <emmeka> mostly little bullshit foot bones and it took lots of surgery to save the leg, and I walk with a limp
[23:04:21] <emmeka> but I'm more or less fine, I can just feel thunderstorms like an old woman now
[23:04:36] <lastonestanding> a broken bone requires you to see a doctor, right?
[23:04:47] <emmeka> with years gone by the limp isn't even noticeable unless I try to run, which doesn't turn out very well.
[23:05:03] <emmeka> lastonestanding ...yes...
[23:05:06] <lastonestanding> or could you endure the pain and it would just heal itself over time?
[23:06:04] <emmeka> lastonestanding if you do that, they have to rebreak the bone to heal it properly.
[23:06:08] <emmeka> so don't.
[23:06:09] <lastonestanding> I just wonder if there is a possibility that I've had a broken bone
[23:06:17] <emmeka> you'd probably be aware.
[23:06:23] <lastonestanding> okay
[23:06:33] <Matt|home> blah, no workies. fuck it
[23:06:50] <MootPoot> okay
[23:06:51] <emmeka> if you break a bone you have to splint it and seek medical attention immediately, ok ##anime. this concludes my kindergarten class.
[23:06:53] <lastonestanding> cuz we have many bones, and they do not break in the same way I'd think
[23:07:05] <MootPoot> so either I redirect one of the other coax cables to this room
[23:07:08] <lastonestanding> even small bones?
[23:07:09] <MootPoot> OR
[23:07:17] <MootPoot> coax booster
[23:07:34] <lastonestanding> a broken boner is certainly bad news
