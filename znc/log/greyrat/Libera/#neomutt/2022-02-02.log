[15:31:18] <gahr> hi flatcap 
[15:32:51] <gahr> what a mess
[15:33:01] <flatcap> hi gahr 
[15:33:02] <flatcap> thanks :-)
[15:33:08] <gahr> haha
[15:33:26] <flatcap> I thought I understood how the generic menus fitted in
[15:33:30] <gahr> excuse my poor command of English
[15:33:30] <flatcap> I wasn't even close :-)
[15:33:42] <gahr> *what a complicated situation to be in :)
[15:33:51] <flatcap> indeed
[15:34:33] <flatcap> I don't know how many people actually `bind generic [something]`
[15:34:48] <flatcap> but it'd be tempting to eliminate the menu altogether
[15:34:55] <gahr> yeah
[15:35:17] <flatcap> i.e. cut'n'paste generic into each menu
[15:35:55] <flatcap> but as I've just learned, running commands via  :exec  or  <push>  gets really confusing
[15:36:19] <flatcap> I think <push> shouldn't be interpreting `<search>` -> OP_SEARCH
[15:36:45] <flatcap> rather leave that for the *actual* menu that calls getch()
[15:37:09] <flatcap> maybe :-)
[15:38:38] <gahr> so, why again does push <copy-message> work but push <search> doesn't in the index?
[15:38:51] <gahr> because <search> is not the index's but the generic's?
[15:38:57] <flatcap> yes
[15:39:17] <flatcap> both implement search, but only pager has it in OpPager
[15:40:13] <gahr> why does push search through the whole list?
[15:40:22] <gahr> shouldn't it just search current menu + generic?
[15:40:50] <flatcap> at startup (neomutt -e ""), there isn't a 'current' Menu
[15:41:18] <flatcap> it tries to be smart by looking through *all* of them
[15:41:58] <flatcap> naturally, generic has to be last in the list
[15:42:43] <flatcap> theoretically, you could push multiple commands for different menus
[15:42:55] * flatcap tries to engineer an example
[15:43:17] <gahr> mh
[15:43:51] <flatcap> neomutt -e "push <display-message>"  -e "push <view-attachments>"  -e "<delete>"
[15:44:07] <flatcap> Index: display; Pager: view att; Attach: delete
[15:44:16] <gahr> display-message is the index's?
[15:44:21] <flatcap> they'd all have to be looked up ahead of time
[15:45:10] <flatcap> obviously, if steps 1 or 2 failed, who know where <delete> would be performed
[15:45:21] <gahr> yeah
[15:46:15] <flatcap> macros are no different (or less dangerous) in vim
[15:46:39] <gahr> yep
[15:46:40] <dcpurton> flatcap: confirming that NeoMutt 20201127 *does* allow you to change the MIME type in these Facebook emails

[16:18:56] <flatcap> <view-attachments>, <enter> shows raw html

[16:34:45] * flatcap will have to experiment
[16:35:04] <flatcap> gahr: I quickly thought of a problem with my idea...
[16:35:36] <flatcap> if the user does:  `push <search>`  what do we queue?
[16:35:47] <flatcap> currently, it's OP_SEARCH
[16:36:27] <flatcap> but if we queue `<`, `s`, `e`... we need to somehow mark it as special
[16:37:29] <flatcap> but what if the users wants to push a sequence of keys that _look_ like a function?
[16:37:43] <flatcap> `push \<search>` maybe
[16:40:09] <flatcap>  
[16:40:11] <flatcap>  Convert issue to a discussion
[16:40:13] <flatcap> Are you sure you want to convert this issue to a discussion?
[16:40:15] <flatcap> What happens when an issue is converted into a discussion:
[16:40:17] <flatcap> Issue will be closed and locked

[18:45:11] <flatcap> if 'sender' exists, could we give that have a higher priority
[18:45:21] <bookworm> multi addresses in the from headers is a good way to immediately land in junk for most email providers
[18:45:43] <bookworm> was a nice idea by the implementers of the RFC but in practice it's a no go
[18:45:44] <flatcap> it's likely (no evidence for this), that it'll match the first from, anyway
[18:46:18] <sengy> I'm having to use xauth2 on one of my imap folders. once I set xauth2 for that account, any other accounts will try to use xauth2 instead of sasl or whatever else. I tried unsetting imap_authenticators on that folder but it doesn't seem to work. Does anybody how to use different authenticators on different accounts?

[18:49:44] <sangy> Kinda surprised this doesn't happen with any other variables
[18:50:34] <gahr> do we discard everything but the first?
[18:50:49] <flatcap> often multi-account problems aren't about *setting* something, it's about forgetting to *unset* something
[18:51:16] <flatcap> I think so.  mutt_addrlist_write() - Write an Address to a buffer
[18:51:36] <sangy> yup, I made super sure to unset all the stuff I set on the new config.
[18:51:40] <flatcap> vs mutt_addrlist_write_list() - Write Addresses to a List
[18:51:49] <gahr> ah sucks
[18:51:56] <gahr> ok then, that makes sense
[18:52:50] <gahr> uhm
[18:53:35] <gahr> why do I see mutt_addrlist_write iterating over the whole list?
[18:53:53] <flatcap> hmm...

[18:56:05] <gahr> %F Author name, or recipient name if the message is from you
[18:56:09] <gahr> this one gets the first one
[18:56:15] <gahr> %f Sender (address + real name), either From: or Return-Path:
[18:56:18] <gahr> this one gets you the full list

[19:00:09] <sangy> flatcap: so this is it https://paste.xinu.at/URTv9u/ the account below works now (xoauth2) does the trick. The top one is now trying to use xoauth2 instead of sasl/whatever

[19:05:49] <gahr> flatcap: I think I tend towards adding the ability to prefer sender using a 's' suffix to the existing expandos
[19:05:50] <sangy> nice, thanks!
[19:06:12] <flatcap> gahr: I've considered that in a few places like threads for numeric values
[19:06:52] <flatcap> %x, %y, %z are invididual amounts, %Cx, %Cy, %Cz are cumulative amount for a collapsed thread
[19:07:36] <gahr> well you probably want to use suffixes instead of prefixes
[19:07:52] <gahr> so 'x' picks the main branch, then according to what follows you can sub-branch
[19:08:17] <gahr> we should probably introduce some grouping in the format
[19:08:17] <flatcap> yes.  suffixes are a bit easier to parse, prefixes look nicer (to this human, at least :-)
[19:08:34] <gahr> so %xsucks is not ambiguous
[19:08:47] <gahr> %<xs>

[19:09:14] <flatcap> %{} is the least troublesome
[19:09:33] <gahr> %{fmt} the date and time of the message is converted to sender's time zone, and "fmt" is expanded by the library function strftime(3); a leading bang disables locales
[19:09:36] <gahr> but it's used
[19:09:43] <flatcap> because we can distinguish dates from other expandos
[19:09:54] <gahr> ah can we?
[19:10:17] <flatcap> but we really need to go the whole distance and %{from} %{size} etc
[19:10:51] <gahr> ah, btw, %< is already used by that date branch, too
[19:11:09] <flatcap> yeah, the dates take all the best chars out of play
[19:11:32] <flatcap> the trick would be to do it in a backwards-compatible way
