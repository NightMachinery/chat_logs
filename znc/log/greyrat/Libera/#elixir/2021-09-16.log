[00:22:11] <hoppity> Is there a way to assign to a variable the HTML from a template with interpolated variables without using the render function?
[00:25:53] <azazel> hoppity: yes, see for example https://hexdocs.pm/eex/EEx.html#eval_string/3

[00:27:22] <hoppity> I think I am getting it now :)

[01:28:04] <hoppity> azazel: I am successfully using eval_file to create a PDF from a template however I am finding myself having to use pure CSS instead of TailwindCSS because apparently something like:  <%= Routes.static_path(@conn, "/css/app.css") %> cannot work when using eval_file
[01:28:12] *** Quits: skali (~skali@46.191.137.79) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[01:28:25] <hoppity> obviously @conn is not available in eval_file 
[01:28:39] <hoppity> so I figured there might be a way to make it work :)
[01:29:52] <azazel> you can use the Phoenix endpoint of your web app in place of the conn
[01:30:49] <hoppity> how would I do that? 
[01:32:14] <azazel> don't you have an ..Endpoint module in your phoenix app?
[01:33:04] <hoppity> yes but how would I used that instead of @conn?
[01:33:56] <azazel> you pass a binding named "conn" with a value set to your Endpoint module, how else?
[01:35:08] <hoppity> sorry I have never directly touched Endpoint that's why I ask
[01:35:20] <hoppity> I've been using Elixir literally for 3 months
[01:36:19] <azazel> what's the full name of your Endpoint module?

[01:38:20] <azazel> it's there on your sources, if you use Phoenix, beside the router.ex module
[01:38:30] <hoppity> let me check
[01:38:52] <hoppity> MyApp.Endpoint?
[01:39:21] <azazel> oh, straight from the demo? :-D
[01:39:36] <hoppity> yeah hah
[01:40:18] <azazel> so you pass a bindings parameter which has a value like [conn: MyApp.Endpoint] ...
[01:40:32] <hoppity> ok, thank you
[01:40:35] <hoppity> I will try that now
[01:44:56] <hoppity> azazel: thank you very much, got it working with a slight variation of your suggestion :)
[01:46:26] <azazel> which variation? well done anyway
[01:46:55] <hoppity> eval_file complained that the Routes module was not available in the template
[01:47:31] <hoppity> so I simply added an assign called css: with the path to my CSS which I obtained by using Routes.static within my controller (not the template as I wanted to originally)
[01:47:44] <azazel> ah, because it's an alias
[01:48:17] <hoppity> it works which is great

[15:48:11] <rawtaz> are you employed and at work there's an elixir project, or are you freelancing and got an elixir gig?
[15:48:40] <serafeim> i tried elixir/phoenix before soem times for work but didn't love it as much as django
[15:48:48] <serafeim> i guess it depends on the kind of projects you do

[15:53:57] <sepow> Right now it's a big hassle, so we'll try to make it a bit nicer
[15:54:14] <serafeim> the main disadavantages of phoenix as compared to django are (for me): 1. the django ORM is much better than ecto. 2. phoenix  does not have automatic migrations. 3. django has builtin users/permissions. 4. phoenix does not have the django-admin. 5. the phoenix ecosystem misses some required django packages (django-tables2, django-filters, drf, django-autocomplete-light, django-crispy-forms).
[15:54:48] <serafeim> the main advantage of phoenix as compared to django is that it has liveview *but* live view is not really useful for the kind of projects i do here

[15:55:37] <serafeim> also the other advantage of phoenix (erlang vs python) is also not useful since i don't need any of the erlang features
[15:57:39] <sepow> The only thing I think Django does 'better' that phoenix as this point is migrations and the automatic admin. The ORM starts getting in your way when doing any complex stuff, the permissions end up being replaced in most of my projects, the admin starts getting in the way as well, but can get you pretty far to be fair. Most of the packages are
[15:57:39] <sepow> unmaintained and or badly written in my experience 
[15:58:02] <serafeim> sepow: you are not using the correct packages
[15:58:08] <sepow> sure
[15:58:12] <serafeim> sepow: take a look at this: https://spapas.github.io/2017/10/11/essential-django-packages/
[15:58:48] <serafeim> the packages i use in all my projects are *all* great. they are supported for like 10 years
[15:59:32] <serafeim> concerning the django ORM, late django versions support *everything*. you can do crazy stuff using just the ORM. i have like 5 years since i needed to use a raw query
[15:59:37] <sepow> I've used most of those packages

[16:00:50] <serafeim> yes wagtail is great!
[16:01:54] <serafeim> also, another problem with phoenix is that it seems to be (at least to me) more complex than needed... probably because it borrows some architecture concepts from ROR ? not sure
[16:02:31] <serafeim> i mean it has schemas/controllers/views/templates... the views is always empty (in my projects at least)
[16:03:22] <serafeim> this adds a level of complexity and indirection that isn't worth it

[16:04:17] <serafeim> yes i saw it it seems to be related to api building
[16:04:45] <sepow> I've been meaning to try it out, but still getting into phoenix
[16:04:52] <serafeim> i avoid APIs like hell. all my projects are server rendered and the only JS is use is either vanilla js or a bit of jquery
[16:05:24] <sepow> Fair enough
[16:05:29] <serafeim> that's why django is the king for me. nobody beats it when you want to built server side rendered apps
[16:05:56] <sepow> I'm here to tell you that I chose phoenix and liveview to do exactly that :)
[16:06:10] <sepow> Anyways, we'll see how it goes, it's been sweet so far

[16:08:59] <serafeim> Nicd: yes but i know that in some particular projects it is useful and better than django
[16:09:41] <serafeim> however i've decided that i will never ever use phoenix by itself
[16:10:01] <serafeim> it will always be backed up by django in order to get the proper migrations and the /admin
[16:10:28] <serafeim> i.e in my lifeguards project i've created all the models in django, fixed the migrations and then i just re-created the schemas in phoenix (but withotu migrations)
[16:10:35] <whk> what is proper migrations? 
[16:10:37] <serafeim> it worked flawlessly
[16:10:40] <sepow> I just did a migration manually, took me 5 minutes to add it to migrations file and changeset
[16:10:42] <serafeim> whk: the django ones.
[16:10:51] <serafeim> sepow: you probably have a small project :)
[16:11:04] <sepow> It was a small migration, true
[16:11:28] <Nicd> heh I remember Django migrations resulting in different states in tests vs runtime, that was fun to debug
[16:11:29] <serafeim> if you have project with *lots of tables* and each one of them changing hundreds of times during the development then you can't work without the django migrations
[16:11:51] <serafeim> Nicd: don't know about this
[16:12:07] <Nicd> clearly you can since Django is not running the web
[16:12:23] <serafeim> also you'll tell me: why would i need to have a project with hundreds of migrations? well that's the way i work. 
[16:12:47] <Nicd> I won't tell you that
[16:13:06] <serafeim> i presume that more careful and organizing people than me would create some tables from the start and very rareyl need to change them during development. that ain't me though
[16:13:12] <serafeim> maybe django has spoiled me
[16:13:50] <serafeim> in any case as i've said after i got the migrations and the /admin from django my lifeguards project went flawlessly
[16:15:06] <serafeim> also i think that i prefer elixir from python. the only thing i don't like about elixir is the macros
[16:15:53] <Nicd> we had about a hundred migrations for our Django project at work. they did indeed work fine until that one time when they created a different DB with SQLite than on PostgreSQL
[16:16:07] <serafeim> Nicd: lol
[16:17:16] <whk> is django admin coupled to the database tables?
[16:17:31] <Nicd> you can extend it but by default it's basically CRUD for the tables
[16:17:45] *** Joins: bit4bit (~bit4bit@190.128.123.78)
[16:18:51] <Nicd> we did use it once for a simple restricted maintenance page for a client but it's not really aimed at that. it's handy for root admin style stuff though
[16:19:20] <serafeim> Nicd: i've got a couple of apps where *the whole app* is through the django admin
[16:19:30] <serafeim> of course the users are rather technical
[16:19:50] <serafeim> but you can go a long way if you don't care about the styling and want to properly configure the admin
[16:20:10] <whk> okay. so it can be useful initially. it is similar to the rails admin gems i assume. 
[16:20:22] <whk> i remember .net had this automatic migration and it caused so much havoc that we reverted to manually write sql migrations. for me active record and ecto is really open for a wide set up use cases
[16:20:24] <serafeim> whk: it depends on the kind of projects
[16:21:08] <serafeim> whk: i haven't ever had a migrations causing havoc. also the migrations that djago creates are rather simple and you can take a look at them and edit them before commiting them
[16:21:46] <serafeim> i've written an article here https://spapas.github.io/2021/07/15/django-choices-to-fk-using-migrations/ on how you can do a fundamendal change in django using the migrations
[16:22:04] <whk> lol, yeah. well, that was in .Net asp.net or something. was a long time ago. 
[16:22:32] <serafeim> i guess there could always be edge cases where automatic things won't work
[16:22:52] <serafeim> but 99 out of 100 times they work flawlessly. and that adds
[16:24:54] <whk> lol, yeah. 3 issues a year with migrations is something i prefer not dealing with :) but I am used to the active record style, so don't have the same problem with ecto migrations. you made me curious, will check out django migrations at some point. 
[16:32:47] <serafeim> if you want to take a look at some django migrations take a look at some django has created for a project: https://github.com/spapas/etsd/tree/master/etsd/msgs/migrations

[22:06:08] <mekhami> i want to schedule a task with dynamic times. basically, i receive a message with a scheduled send time, and in my elixir app i want to process the message, then set up that job to run at the scheduled time.
[22:06:21] <mekhami> what's the right tool for this? can i schedule a task dynamically with oban/quantum something like that?
[22:06:33] <mekhami> i am reading up on them and they seem more for like recurring jobs/static schedules
[22:07:51] <sorentwo> mekhami: You can schedule a job at a particular time with scheduled_at in Oban, `MyJob.new(args, scheduled_at: time)`
[22:08:38] <benwilson512> yup Oban works great for this
[22:08:40] <mekhami> okay. does quantum do the same? would quantum be better for the usecase? having a hard time parsing the readmes for what they are good at
[22:09:32] <sorentwo> Quantum doesn't do the same thing, it's strictly for CRON type work. Though, disclaimer, I'm very biased here =)
[22:09:33] <mekhami> and also re: oban, i pass it the data it needs, what's it doing with that data until the job fires? keeps it in memory, i assume?
[22:09:57] <mekhami> oh i see it relies on postgres
[22:09:59] <sorentwo> Oban stores the data in Postgres until it processes it later.
[22:11:31] <mekhami> was hoping not to add postgres to this service. right now i'm planning on just using genservers
[22:11:54] <mouseghost> mekhami, take a look: https://erlang.org/doc/search/
[22:11:56] <mouseghost> aaaa
[22:11:57] <mouseghost> not this link
[22:12:03] <mouseghost> https://erlang.org/doc/man/timer.html
[22:12:06] <mouseghost> this is the link ^
[22:12:42] <mouseghost> or this one, actually https://erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#send_after-3
[22:13:09] <mouseghost> and then when you get the message, you can process it at the time it arrives
[22:13:39] <mekhami> yeah the send after thing is fine but i'm going to be pressed for memory
[22:14:10] <mekhami> if i receive a spike of 100k messages each at like 50-100kb of data
[22:16:38] <mekhami> so i'm thinking about oban cause i could just drop the scheduled messages in and not store anything in memory
[22:17:25] <mekhami> sorentwo: now i see why you're biased ;)
[22:17:48] <mouseghost> oh oh i see
[22:22:26] <mekhami> sorentwo: can you 'cancel' a specific job?
[22:22:40] <mekhami> like if i schedule 5 messages, but i want to cancel any pending messages if the user responds
[22:22:56] <mekhami> i need to cancel any pending tasks with that unique id
[22:23:20] <sorentwo> mekhami: Sure, there's https://hexdocs.pm/oban/Oban.html#cancel_job/2 and https://hexdocs.pm/oban/Oban.html#cancel_all_jobs/2
