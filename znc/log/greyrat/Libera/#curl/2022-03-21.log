[12:03:45] <TimWolla> https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.2 - Am I understanding the ABNF correctly that "1 2 3" would technically not be a valid header value? The field-content production appears to require a single non-space at the start and end and field-value is just a repetition of field-content. Thus the first field-content consumes "1 2", leaving "<space>3" which is not valid.

[15:32:55] <quinq> Between closing accidentally and not caring, there's “closed without proper testing”
[15:35:42] <Piru> this thing also has GDPR impact. I tried to ask them if they will notify data controllers as per their own guidance. they could not answer
[15:36:13] *** Quits: icing (~stefan@user/icing) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[15:37:21] <Piru> "For the GDPR concerns, our privacy teams are looped in on the case to go over any concerns and note if any notifications would be necessary".
[15:37:58] <quinq> So they don't mean they cannot do it
[15:38:00] <Piru> funnily. no notifications. I would know about it since I am in loop with the guys who would get such notification
[15:38:09] <quinq> They just mean if doing so would expose they're not respecting GDPR
[15:39:09] <Piru> and this is not just EU thing btw, california has very similar CCPA afaik
[15:40:18] <Piru> it'll be rather interesting to hear what their justification for this will be
[15:42:03] <Piru> they did not disable the vulnerable functionality, nor did they notify data controllers or processors. and this has been going since jan 2022, and the vulnerabilitry has been there for years
[15:42:18] <Piru> I just don't get it
[15:42:42] <Piru> they better have a very good reason
[15:44:04] <Piru> quinq: fear not, it will definitely come out. but I'll give them ample chance to explain their position
[15:45:59] <Piru> just from the reactions from some ppl in the inner circle at this point I know there will be a bloody shitstorm about this
[15:46:47] <quinq> jaja
[15:47:12] <gevaerts> Their procedures are probably not tuned for people who have contacts with internal people on their side *and* with data controller people :)
[15:47:12] <quinq> The good side is that it should improve things in the future
[15:53:38] <Piru> the "fun" part about this vulnerabilities is the presistence of it. even when they fix this it'll affect everythying retroactively still

[16:16:09] <bagder> tricky. A mitm-server ?
[16:18:15] <jfuller> nginx reverse proxy ...
[16:19:40] <bagder> do any of them support that kind of auth change out of the box?
[16:19:49] <bagder> them == reverse proxies
[16:21:59] <gevaerts> Basically everything I find that ends up not being about something else after all is people asking and not getting a reply :)
[16:22:22] <jfuller> vnc ;)
[16:22:52] <jfuller> or create ssh tunnel
[16:24:03] <jfuller> which injects digest auth ;)
[16:24:43] <bagder> digest needs two requests, so injecting is more complicated than so
[16:25:08] <jfuller> sure, and if u can do ssh tunnel ... why not just browse with lynx or some other client that supports digest
[16:25:27] <gevaerts> Well, if it was about browsing there wouldn't be much of a problem
