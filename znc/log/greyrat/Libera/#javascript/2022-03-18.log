My approach as a programmer would have been to try to create these super specific UIs designed around the intentions of the users, e.g. a form with like 10 fields for putting in details about an author or a complicated system to input geopgrahical data for countries"

[00:53:23] <sheetjs> clean that up a bit and put it somewhere
[00:53:59] <sheetjs> was thinking about this when trying to deal with github issues
[00:54:01] <buu> I'm not sure what the exact lesson is but something to do with how hard it is to actually anticipate people's needs and how much extra work people will do when they're engaged
[00:54:14] <sheetjs> now there's an option to remove the default box and force people to use templates
[00:54:22] <buu> sheetjs: You see it a lot with people basically running all sorts of 'daily content' type websites off a forum
[00:54:32] <blueagain> I would argue (no idea if this still applies today) that wiki's users were mostly technical people at first
[00:55:09] <sheetjs> is the lesson "when left to their own devices, a community of people will discover norms and structure"?
[00:55:12] <buu> blueagain: wiki also has the huge feature of 'undo' basically
[00:55:28] <buu> sheetjs: Well, if you want people to contribute, make it as easy as possible?
[00:55:33] <blueagain> I had this idea for a semantic wiki where you could define everything as a relationship (either predicate or subtype) between things. But someone else probably already did it
[00:55:40] <buu> sheetjs: But yeah, that too
[00:55:58] <buu> I doubt any of the original wiki developers could have guessed what kind of tools people would want when building 450 pokemon pages =]

[01:03:32] <sheetjs> you could also get that information by scanning the result and doing a reduce (since it's an actual array, not a stream)

[01:03:44] <sheetjs> yeah
[01:04:18] <sheetjs> so right now, lets say you had a worksheet like "a,b,c\n1,,3\n4,,6\n7,8,9"
[01:04:46] <sheetjs> the current behavior is to generate [{a:1,c:3}, {a:4, c:6}, {a:7, b:8, c:9}]
[01:04:54] *** Quits: nuclearg1 (~nucleargr@user/nuclearg1) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[01:05:10] <sheetjs> the ask was for generating [{a:1, b: null, c:3}, {a:4, c:6}, {a:7, b:8, c:9}]
[01:05:33] <blueagain> got it, header row is always explicit
[01:05:36] <sheetjs> that's a transform you can do in a fairly simple reduce
[01:05:55] <buu> huh
[01:06:05] <buu> Yeah, I'd kinda expect object.keys() to give me all of the headers

[01:06:16] <sheetjs> so there's an option to do that for *every row*
[01:06:26] <sheetjs> the user wanted an option for just the first row
[01:07:10] <buu> I mean, this is basically how ORMS for sql do it right?
[01:07:24] <sheetjs> correct, which is why the option for the first row didn't really make sense
[01:07:28] <buu> yeah
[01:07:31] <sheetjs> and why post-processing was recommended
[01:07:31] <buu> I agree
[01:07:55] <sheetjs> but merely saying "you can implement this in a reduce" assumes the reader understands how reduce or other array functions work
[01:08:00] <buu> sheetjs: Well, except your last row is 3..
[01:08:15] <buu> eh
[01:08:36] <buu> Well, the obvious answer is to just turn on the option for all rows
[01:08:43] <buu> Which is what I would definitely have done
[01:09:05] <sheetjs> from the library perspective, the default only includes cells with data and there's an option to insert a "default value"
[01:10:06] <sheetjs> the javascript developer base is, by and large, aware of but not intimately familiar with array operations
[01:10:33] <sheetjs> so it feels like it's not sufficient to make a comment about how certain operations are doable in plain JavaScript
[01:10:42] <buu> It seems weird that the default isn't to include null columns, as it were
[01:10:44] <sheetjs> aka docs for a library devolve into docs for the language
[01:10:55] <buu> yeah
[01:12:28] <buu> sheetjs: One subtle thing I appreciate about perl and go oddly enough is that they have a very simple standard library because they rely on functions built into the.. core for lack of a better word
[01:12:42] <buu> When your "standard library" allows namespaces you tend to end up with a proliferation of functions
[01:13:09] <buu> string.substr string.slice string.substring etc etc
[01:13:24] <blueagain> well, it seems no language solves this well, php is a huge mess
[01:15:11] <blueagain> the best solution I've found so far is used a subset js as monitored by my linter that gives me a rather clean and consistent subset of the language

[02:50:21] <systemfault> I just use uBlock Origin...
[02:50:35] <sheetjs> sponsorblock is crowdsourced
[02:51:42] <systemfault> Had never heard of that one, it's better?
[02:51:53] <sheetjs> solves a different problem
[02:52:13] <sheetjs> ublock origin blocks the ads that youtube inserts before/after/during videos
[02:52:27] <sheetjs> sponsorblock is designed to block "sponsored content" segments

[02:54:20] <sheetjs> there are a few more sponsored blocks later in the video
[02:54:21] <ljharb> blueagain: because the brits forgot that lemons cured scurvy, and the british east india company replaced lemons on ships with cheaper limes, and limes have less vitamin C than lemons, so british sailors had to drink tons more lime juice to not die, so they smelled like lime juice

[04:25:39] <Maxdamantus> imo it's not unreasonable to expect an explicit `// fall through` comment in the empty cases.
[04:25:52] <Maxdamantus> Though I guess clang allows it.
[04:26:38] <Maxdamantus> Dunno if eslint has an exception for a `// fall through` comment. I only know that gcc does.

[04:28:21] <sheetjs> tried digging into the history Maxdamantus
[04:28:50] <sheetjs> ecmascript spec doesnt use the phrase, but GCC/Clang have a specific meaning
[04:29:08] <sheetjs> and that meaning generally requires at least one statement
[04:29:34] <Maxdamantus> Of course, I wouldn't expect it to be specified in any language. In both cases it's just some warning that can optionally be enabled in a compiler/linter.
[04:29:45] <sheetjs> its specified in C++ and now C
[04:29:45] <Maxdamantus> gcc doesn't warn about that by default.
[04:30:24] <Maxdamantus> Hm, really? Okay, haven't really read the C specification in depth since C99.
[04:30:35] <sheetjs> yeah there's a specific warning flag, it's not part of -Wall

[04:37:51] <systemfault> The code looks like a broken version of Base64URL
[04:38:04] <Maxdamantus> fwiw, Minall: you should probably use `unescape(encodeURIComponent(data))` before passing it to `btoa`.
[04:38:06] <sheetjs> there are multiple base64 encodings
[04:38:29] <Maxdamantus> (assuming `btoa` is the preferred way; not sure if it is currently)
[04:38:49] <sheetjs> differing on encodings of 62 and 63.  for example, MIME encoding use + and / while base64 url uses - and _
[04:38:50] <systemfault> Base64URL is base64 then you replace + with - and = with _
[04:39:04] <systemfault> Err
[04:39:10] <systemfault> sheetjs: is right
[04:39:23] <Minall> Maxdamantus, thanks, I will make that change
[04:39:42] <Minall> systemfault yep, I'm basically first encoding into base64 and then replacing
[04:39:46] <systemfault> So, I'd expect a btoa + 2xreplaceall
[04:40:07] <systemfault> I see 3 replaces in that code, and they're not "replace alls"
[04:40:08] <buu> austincheney: Well, not weird, just tedious
[04:40:10] <Maxdamantus> So to go the other way, you just do the replacements in reverse, then atob.
[04:40:22] <buu> austincheney: You almost always have to compute the ending index based on a length
[04:40:27] <Minall> systemfault Yes, it is what I'm doing in my first function, and I could also do atob in order to decode the base64URL and then replace ?
[04:40:32] <Minall> Hmmm
[04:40:34] <Maxdamantus> systemfault: the replacements look okay.
[04:40:39] <Minall> Maxdamantus That's a good one
[04:40:44] <Minall> But one question...
[04:40:47] <Maxdamantus> systemfault: '=' is the only one that can trail, because it's padding.
[04:40:48] <systemfault> Maxdamantus: It will replace all of them?
[04:41:10] <systemfault> n> 'aaaaa'.replace(/a/, 'b')
[04:41:11] <jellobot> (okay) 'baaaa'
[04:41:13] <Minall> .replace(/=+$/, '').replace(/\+/g, '-').replace(/\//g, '_') I could follow the lasts replaces, However, I'm curious about the first one
[04:41:13] <systemfault> n> 'aaaaa'.replace(/a/g, 'b')
[04:41:14] <jellobot> (okay) 'bbbbb'
[04:41:21] <systemfault> Ahh okay
[04:41:22] <Maxdamantus> systemfault: '+' and '/' are all replaced, yes.
[04:41:38] *** Joins: bobdobbs (~user@116.251.146.222)
[04:41:47] <systemfault> Makes sense now, it removes the extra padding then replace the characters
[04:42:13] <Minall> The thing is that I'm replacing the + for '', it is the first replace... How should I 'undo' that?
[04:43:21] <Maxdamantus> Minall: the first replacement removes the trailing '=' padding characters, but they shouldn't be necessary when decoding with `atob`.
[04:44:02] <Minall> Would it be: const decodeBase64URL = data => data.replace('/-/g', '+').replace('/_/g', '/') ?
[04:44:05] <Minall> Hmm, I see
[04:44:10] <Minall> So the first replace is unnecessary
[04:45:00] <Maxdamantus> Minall: basically, a base64 string always has a length divisible by 4, so you add '=' characters until the length is divisible by 4 agian, but `atob` can figure that out anyway.
[04:46:34] <Maxdamantus> If you really want to add them back: base64 + "=".repeat((4 - base64.length % 4) % 4)

[04:48:15] <Maxdamantus> Not really. It just reconstructs the original base64 string again based on how base64 normally works. You didn't actually lose any data.
[04:48:55] <Maxdamantus> The padding bits are only useful if you need to detect where multiple base64 strings have been concatenated.

[05:13:07] <ljharb> !loops are evil @ blahboybaz
[05:13:07] <jellobot> blahboybaz, Loops fail to clearly signal the intention of your code, and as such should be avoided whenever possible (prefer higher-order functions, such as .map, .reduce, .filter, ...). See also: http://qr.ae/RNMEGA and https://gist.github.com/robotlolita/7643014
[05:13:21] <ljharb> blahboybaz: iow, never use any loops. But also, never use for-in with arrays
[05:13:27] <ljharb> !for-in @ blahboybaz
[05:13:27] <jellobot> blahboybaz, for..in is not to loop through indices/values of an array. Use for(init;cond;step) or Array#forEach. For..in iterates over *all* enumerable properties of an object, without any defined order. See also !iteration

[06:13:26] <Maxdamantus> I guess the way to write that without switch would be: out: { int len = end - in; if(len == 1) break out; data |= .. in[1] ..; if(len == 2) break out; data |= .. out[2] ..; if(len == 3) break out; data |= .. out[3] ..; }
[06:14:27] <Maxdamantus> or maybe replace the `out: { .. }` block with `out: do{ .. }while(0);` since I don't think C allows labels on compound statements.

[06:20:49] <Maxdamantus> Right, in JS `in[1]` would probably instead be `a[in + 1]`, then `end - in` still kind of makes sense.
[06:21:01] <sheetjs> was trying to "modernize" some JS code and found that the C-style JS is faster than modern JS
[06:21:15] <sheetjs> enough to keep using C-style JS
[06:21:27] <suss> sample of the c-style js?
[06:21:58] <sheetjs> for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i) vs array forEach or for..of
[06:22:07] <suss> see
[06:22:42] <sheetjs> you'd recognize it because you'd automatically wonder why it wasn't using some modern thing
[06:23:22] <Maxdamantus> I wouldn't discount `for..of` from being "C-style", since iteration in C doesn't necessarily use an integer counter, but it never involves a function expression.
[06:24:12] <suss> also wander why the for loop on some point is faster than the modern things that i could not say
[06:24:20] <sheetjs> for..of doesn't give you true flow control

[06:24:47] <Maxdamantus> and different people have different opinions about `forEach`. Personally I'd usually avoid `forEach` because it doesn't really add anything clarity-wise, and it just limits the sort of logic you can use (eg, code that would simply `break` or `continue` to an outer label now requires some boolean states).

[09:14:17] <Maxdamantus> Seems like a weird way of writing it though. Seems cleaner to use `String.fromCharCode(parseInt(char, 2))`
[09:14:19] <blahboybaz> EdFletcher: Uhh.. it looks like its converting binary to ascii there or sometihng - are you looking at the second part of that where it is shown in the code example?

[09:15:23] <EdFletcher> blahboybaz: you asked 'what the " 0b "' was. that link answers that.
[09:15:25] <blahboybaz> I'm not talking about the entire code example, I'm talking about the "0b" in the context of "`0b${char}`" which is in that code example here
[09:15:42] <Maxdamantus> It's producing a string representing a number in binary and passing that string to `String.fromCharCode`, which turns numbers (usually actual numbers rather than strings) into code units.
[09:16:02] <blahboybaz> EdFletcher: I can see it is performing a function in the code (not just a string literal)
[09:16:05] <blahboybaz> Isn't it?

[09:17:23] <jellobot> blahboybaz, '*'
[09:17:50] <Maxdamantus> It's doing something like that, passing one of those "0b..." strings, which when converted to a number gets interpreted in binary.
[09:18:11] <sheetjs> that wasn't the question
[09:18:33] <blahboybaz> I can see what its doing but I want to learn about things of that kind in js - the sort of thing that 0b is
[09:18:37] <sheetjs> blahboybaz: in the same way that 0x... represents a hex literal, 0.... represents an octal literal and 0b.... represents a binary literal

[09:20:16] <Maxdamantus> It's not technically a numeric literal, since it's just part of a string.
[09:20:16] <blahboybaz> I thought a literal was just some static, lifeless, thing that doesn't do anything
[09:20:38] <EdFletcher> Maxdamantus: it's interpreted as the numeric literal by fromCharCode even as a string

[09:21:33] <EdFletcher> blahboybaz: sure thing
[09:21:40] <Maxdamantus> Well, a "numeric literal" is a syntactic construction.
[09:21:50] <Maxdamantus> and there's no syntax denoting a numeric literal there.
[09:21:57] <Maxdamantus> Yes, it corresponds with the numeric literal syntax.
[09:22:39] <EdFletcher> ah it's just coercion https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/911393215440113704/954255995352256522/unknown.png
[09:22:47] <EdFletcher> TIL! nice
[09:23:12] <blahboybaz> It's like a type? The way number and string are types? So that thing is like telling the inerpreter what type to interpret it as?

[09:25:46] <blahboybaz> I string litteral is sourounded by quotes it does't do anything it like a hard coding sometihng. That thing (the 0b) looks like its informing the interpreter to read that number as a binary number (rather than a string or a base 10 number or anything else). It appears to be serving a purpose to the interpreter
[09:26:17] <Maxdamantus> blahboybaz: JS will automatically convert strings to numbers in various places, as demonstrated in EdFletcher's screenshot.
[09:26:33] <Maxdamantus> n> "5" - 4; @ blahboybaz
[09:26:34] <jellobot> blahboybaz, 1

[09:27:06] <jellobot> blahboybaz, 9
[09:27:35] <Maxdamantus> `String.fromCharCode` will also convert its argument from string to number, because it normally takes a number.
[09:27:37] <blahboybaz> Ok Imna have to take some time to absorb all this

[09:34:39] <Maxdamantus> It's very strange code, but the point is presumably to replace occurences of binary numbers in a string with their corresponding code units.

[09:41:16] <blahboybaz> so is char getting its value from str?
[09:41:27] <sheetjs> correct, some part of str
[09:41:33] <sheetjs> and that is determined based on the replace
[09:41:41] <sheetjs> *based on the regex in the replace
[09:41:56] <blahboybaz> in other words they if you call the function with 1001 then 1001 passes basically THROUGH str TO char where the work actually gets done?

[09:42:08] <sheetjs> not quite
[09:42:12] <sheetjs> lets take a more interesting example
[09:42:23] <sheetjs> n> const binaryAgent = str => str.replace(/\d+./g, char => String.fromCharCode(`0b${char}`)); binaryAgent("abc 1001")
[09:42:24] <jellobot> (okay) 'abc \t'
[09:42:44] <sheetjs> "abc 1001" the replace function looks for matches of the regexp
[09:42:52] <sheetjs> in this case, "1001" would be the only match
[09:48:42] *** Joins: adas (adas@adas.shelltalk.net)
[09:49:27] <blahboybaz> I don't feel like we're talking about the same thing. Besides it would be hard for me to apply a second example to something I'm trying to figure out because how would I match it up to the first thing (the original example). Yes, I understand, the code is shit - we've established that. But regardless of it's quality there is something to be learned and it is what I was looking at when the question
[09:49:33] <blahboybaz> arose.   Now... I want to bring this back in though... I'm still trying to get at an understanding of the  0b  - I'm just trying to trace it to the  0b  and getting caught at that poing (where char is getting its value passed in) - but the real issue is understanding what  0b is doing.   When somone talks about a literal a literal does not perform any operation its just a dead peice of data that
[09:49:39] <blahboybaz> does not change --> "this is a string literal" it does nothing just sits there. But anyone that looks at 0b can see that it is litterally telling the interpreter that it is a binary number being fed to it (to inform it that it is not base 10). How is that a litteral anything? It is doing something

[09:50:51] <blahboybaz> I have no idea
[09:50:56] <blahboybaz> base 8?
[09:50:57] <sheetjs> that's an "octal number"
[09:50:59] <sheetjs> yep base 8
[09:51:07] <sheetjs> and 0b1001 is a "binary number" base 2
[09:51:13] <sheetjs> in all cases, they are "literals"
[09:51:34] <sheetjs> MDN defines literal as
[09:51:37] <sheetjs> Literals represent values in JavaScript. These are fixed values‚Äînot variables‚Äîthat you literally provide in your script.
[09:52:25] <blahboybaz> I'm reading it but it sounds illogical - actually anti logical - really
[09:52:43] <sheetjs> var x = 1234;
[09:52:52] <sheetjs> x is a variable, 1234 is a literal
[09:53:10] <sheetjs> 1234 does not change when running a script
[09:54:44] <blahboybaz> yeah but base 10 is obviously the default (so you don't have to decalare what kind of nuber is being supplied)

[09:57:56] <blahboybaz> in strongly typed languages (and I understand that js is not one of those) the type and the value are two separate things. The type defines the value in terms of what it is. In languages like that there is a way to tell the compiler (I'm thinking of C and C++) that you are giving it a hex or octal or a binary number and it looks just like 0x or 0b (like here in js). Now I don't recall exactly what
[09:58:02] <blahboybaz> that prefix is called in other languages but I don't think its a literal. It serves and important enougn purpose to have its own designation - like a unary operator or something
[09:58:17] <sheetjs> what languages are you familiar with?
[09:58:29] <sheetjs> pretty sure K&R (C) refers to literals
[09:58:51] <Decker> prefixes just determine the radix of integer constants
[09:59:09] <Decker> they're all integer  (unless suffixed with L, U, LLU something)
[09:59:14] <sheetjs> ooh take that bad, K&R calls them octal constants
[09:59:31] <sheetjs> "hexadecimal constant" 0x...
[10:00:02] <blahboybaz> I never got great at any lang really. I started on C and C++ but that was a terribly long time ago and I forgot a lot (in other words theres gaping holes - especially in terminology where remembering a term would literally open up the answer to many things)
[10:00:14] <sheetjs> and "integer constant" for the normal case
[10:00:39] <sheetjs> blahboybaz: its probably better to think of it as "binary constant" since that's the C parlance (and probably the same in $LANG that you prefer)
[10:00:45] <blahboybaz> I'm sure I'm just worng about how I was looking at it
[10:02:01] <blahboybaz> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cause a sceene but good grief that sounded really odd (as in massive cognitive dissnance - STRANGE!)

[20:33:42] <rendar> how can i map a span to a string?
[20:33:59] <rendar> i mean, if i get a clicked event, i get the span in 'target'
[20:34:06] <rendar> then i get a string for that 'target'
[20:34:20] <cthulchu> target.innerText?
[20:36:05] <rendar> cthulchu, nope, the text is something internal
[20:36:08] <rendar> not something i want to show
[20:36:30] <cthulchu> ljharb,  I don't want to sort them. So my idea is to have a 255 chars string. each char in its position indicates certain test result. But for a coder to manipulate a string like that would be a problem. They would need to... count... Instead, I want to make an object with explicit test names that a coder can quickly find and set. But then I need to combine that in the string. With guaranteed order...
[20:36:53] <cthulchu> rendar, what do you want tot show then?

[22:38:48] <blueagain> sheetjs: can't they just do it as they do it in other rules, consider all fallthroughs unintentional unless some eslint rule config options are set?
[22:39:07] <blueagain> they could add some sane defaults, but they're a bit opinionated here
[22:39:08] <sheetjs> there are two internally consistent opinions on fallthrough
[22:39:24] <sheetjs> 1) interpret every separate case as a fallthrough
[22:39:34] <sheetjs> so even stuff like case 1: case 2: would be considered fallthrough
[22:39:51] <sheetjs> this is how "matching" languages like rust work
[22:39:53] <blueagain> yup, that's what I meant as a possible default
[22:40:00] <blueagain> or "base"
[22:40:05] *** Joins: gehn (~gehn@user/gehn)
[22:40:21] <sheetjs> while super verbose, i think that's better than the current default
[22:41:11] <sheetjs> ideally no-fallthrough would have an option to switch between "strict" and "relaxed"
[22:41:26] <sheetjs> with relaxed warning when there's a statement in a case clause
[22:42:55] <buu> hans: Yes but you still have to declare match
[22:44:26] <hans>  speaking of, why is this illegal?  if(let v=f()){}
[22:44:48] <blueagain> sheetjs: wouldn't it solve your issue to add '// falls through' whenever you need an override, or is this too cumbersome / verbose?
[22:45:03] <buu> hans: because javascript hates the living
[22:45:37] *** Joins: bambanxx (~bambanx@190.162.68.107)
[22:45:46] <buu> Most likely because it was slightly hard to implement originally so they just said it was illegal
[22:46:11] <ljharb> because that would be terrible
[22:46:16] <ljharb> `if` takes an expression
[22:46:18] *** Joins: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse)
[22:46:29] <ljharb> variable declarations aren't an expression
[22:46:43] <ljharb> hans: just do `const v = f(); if (v) {}`, much cleaner
[22:46:55] <ljharb> you can wrap that in `{ }` if you're super concerned with scoping
[22:46:56] *** Joins: summersault (~summersau@179.221.251.36)
[22:47:30] <sheetjs> blueagain: imho the C interpretation is the one most people colloquially understand to be fallthrough

[22:47:49] <hans> ljharb: yeah now i either have to create a new scope, or clutter the parent scope with a variable that is only relevant inside that if(){}, because js doesn't let me declare it in the if

[22:47:53] <hans> slightly annoying
[22:48:04] <sheetjs> current: `case 1: case 2:` is not fallthrough; `case 1:\ncase 2:` is not fallthrough; `case 1:\n\ncase 2:` is fallthrough
[22:48:28] *** Joins: The_Blode (~Blode@user/the-blode/x-7164444)
[22:48:30] <blueagain> yeah, that's kind of ugly
[22:49:35] <sheetjs> it would be ok if the relaxed (statement) interpretation or the strict (every case) interpretation is used
[22:49:39] <sheetjs> but right now it's inconsistent
[22:50:00] <sheetjs> and more importantly, it is not used anywhere else but eslint
[22:50:21] <DPA> _1: { const v = f(); if (!v) break _1;  ...  }
[22:50:50] <hans> you can just use {} but
[22:51:13] <hans> are you just creating a _1 goto-label there?
[22:51:18] <DPA> Yes
[22:51:28] <sheetjs> *labeled block / break
[22:51:41] <sheetjs> you can do the same thing with `if` statements and `for` loops
[22:52:01] <hans> sure but i don't see the point?
[22:52:17] <sheetjs> avoiding 7 levels of if-nesting https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs/blob/master/modules/83_numbers.ts#L47
[22:52:47] <DPA> This is also valid:  _1:{} _1:{}  So no need to think of a new name every time.
[22:53:03] <hans> ouch don't like that
[22:53:17] <sheetjs> this is much more readable than the equivalent
[22:53:20] <ljharb> hans: sure but your functions should be small, so "clutter" shouldn't be a real problem
