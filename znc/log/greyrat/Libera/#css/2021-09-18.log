[00:33:48] <teut> how to get that effect?
[00:34:04] <teut> not fixed  but  sticky
[00:34:22] <teut> but when I used sticky  it was a no-op
[00:37:14] <teut> https://niroggyan.com/how-it-works    and how to make that  animation line?
[00:37:29] <teut> is there a library available?

[01:32:20] <teut> how does the thing works in a carousel when like 5 items go from left to right  and then when the first item then comes from the right
[01:32:26] <teut> a marquee
[01:32:40] <teut> ?

[01:40:48] <carlino3> teuet i think you can achieve that effect with flexbox and an animation
[01:40:52] <carlino3> teut
[01:41:30] <teut> if you got 5 elements you cant do it
[01:41:42] <teut> you can only doo it with infinite elements
[01:41:47] <teut> thats for sure
[01:42:09] <carlino3> no
[01:42:59] <carlino3> teut https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox_items.asp#order
[01:43:00] <teut> you can translate all elements  20px  the the left
[01:43:33] <carlino3> when one element goes outside the screen, you reorder the items
[01:43:48] <teut> and how do you know its out of the screen?
[01:44:00] <carlino3> 1,2,3,4 - 2,3,4,1 - 3,4,1,2, etc
[01:44:34] <carlino3> hmm i would use some JS, but lets see how we can do it with pure CSS
[01:44:42] <teut> I m in react
[01:45:06] <teut> so that would had been easy if the js guys also had answered my question
[01:46:03] <teut> https://usehooks.com/useOnScreen/
[01:46:14] <teut> this will be useful
[01:48:21] <teut> https://bharatpe.com/   what technique are these guys using?

[03:16:16] <hassoon> quackgyver: because of the padding
[03:16:24] <quackgyver> Can you be more specific
[03:18:28] <hassoon> quackgyver: padding is included in an element's total width or height
[03:18:42] <hassoon> quackgyver: it's the space between the element's content and its borders
[03:18:47] <quackgyver> I don't thin you're understanding the case here.

[03:20:33] <hassoon> quackgyver: that's what's causing the heights' inequality ^
[03:20:59] <hassoon> quackgyver: do you understand now why they don't have the same height ?
[03:20:59] <quackgyver> You're missing the border though?
[03:21:36] <hassoon> quackgyver: ya meh, borders do count too
[03:21:46] <quackgyver> Yes, and the padding+border should add up to 1em.
[03:21:51] <quackgyver> So it should be the same height.
[03:22:03] <hassoon> quackgyver: inequal borders and paddings, but equalt content height does mean inequal total height
[03:22:10] <quackgyver> It's not inequal.
[03:22:32] <hassoon> quackgyver: em is a relative not a precised/fixed one
[03:22:45] <quackgyver> Yes, but both are em, and both add up to 1em.

[03:25:51] <hassoon> quackgyver: anyway em means it's related to something else
[03:26:22] <quackgyver> Yes, I'm well aware. I've set the jsfiddle up to utilize em as intended, with dynamic scaling on top of that.
[03:26:29] <hassoon> quackgyver: if i were you and i'm worried about having the same height for two elements, i'd use fixed units
[03:26:30] <quackgyver> You should be able to tell by looking at the jsfiddle that I understand what em is.
[03:26:41] <quackgyver> That's not going to solve my use case.

[03:27:49] <hassoon> yout loss
[03:27:52] <hassoon> your loss
[03:31:25] <quackgyver> Ah, my friend helped me solve it. Apparently different browsers handle non-integer border sizes differently. so some browsers will round borders up or down to the closest integer. This means that you'll end up with an extra pixel on each side on the off chance that one is using a browser that won't allow border widths that aren't perfectly integer-based.
[03:31:28] <quackgyver> Very interesting.
[03:31:32] <hassoon> quackgyver: the calculated padding of first and second are not the same
[03:32:57] <quackgyver> I would expect that modern browsers would use anti-aliasing to hint at a border smaller than 1px - or at the very least not let the rounded-up pixels disturb the HTML flow. But maybe that'd be too much of a hit on the performance. :D
[03:33:27] <hassoon> meh do not use relative units for border sizing or paddings

[14:09:58] <pagios> hello, is it a good habit to use css grids for main page layout and then use inside each of the grid elements some bootstrap to further arrange?
[14:14:07] <hassoon> pagios: whatever you're comfortable with, doesn't matter
[14:14:22] <hassoon> pagios: and..whatever your needs are, it's really up to you
[14:30:36] <FunkyBob> given bootstrap is just CSS... you could just use CSS inside your CSS..

[14:42:07] <pagios> FunkyBob: so only css grid u mean no bootstrap?
[14:44:46] <hassoon> pagios: FunkyBob: means earn css grid and use it
[14:44:53] <hassoon> * learn css *
[14:45:25] <pagios> hassoon: should be enough ?
[14:45:39] <pagios> no need for bootstrap once done?
[14:54:05] <FunkyBob> there's no need for bootstrap ever
[14:54:08] <FunkyBob> but if it helps, use it
[14:54:32] <FunkyBob> it's bunches of pre-debugged, pre-configured CSS

[19:05:20] <pagios> what do you guys think of ant design
[19:07:50] <pavonia> I think their abdomen is too big in relation to their thorax
[19:08:30] <stenno> ants are cool
[19:09:09] <stenno> did you know that termite queens can get 50 years old?
[19:09:30] <biggusnickus> If you got many ants, you got few sneks
[19:09:38] <biggusnickus> Good small soldiers
[19:13:03] <mannequin> maybe they're smaller than you can see
[19:20:00] <pagios> i kind of prefer them over material ui
[19:20:05] <pagios> not sure if you agree

[22:17:57] <sysdef> hi. can i define a box-shadow, inner and outer for the same object on the same side(s)?
[22:19:12] <Rockwood> sure why not
[22:27:40] <sysdef> i understand, "inset" is an optional parameter for inner shadows to decide between outer and inner shadows
[22:36:41] <Rockwood> yes you can
[22:50:11] <sysdef> so, when you have to decide between ainner and outer. how can you set both?
[22:54:52] <sysdef> "You can set multiple effects separated by commas" ... i see ^^

[22:56:48] <sysdef> great. thanks!
