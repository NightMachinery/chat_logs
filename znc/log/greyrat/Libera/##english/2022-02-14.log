[03:55:05] <blackop> is there a word like "lavatory" ?

[03:55:38] *** Joins: OnkelTem (~OnkelTem@user/onkeltem)
[03:57:57] <LuisR14> yes
[03:58:25] <blackop> so "lavatory" is correct right?
[04:01:52] <LuisR14> it is a word that exists in english and has that meaning, yes
[04:03:19] <MetaNova> blackop: bathroom, restroom, washroom, toilet
[04:03:33] <MetaNova> roughly in that order of descending preference
[04:03:38] <MetaNova> IMO
[04:04:54] <LuisR14> time to rest there
[04:05:17] * LuisR14 goes and falls asleep on the toilet
[04:05:25] <blackop> danke :p
[04:08:54] <twb> pussipupu: your smart quotes are wonky for English
[04:10:02] <twb> If you're going to call is a "bathroom" it bloody well ought to have a bath in it

Then you wash your hands in the kitchen, or not at all.

[18:20:48] <Rashad> rindolf Hi o/
[18:20:49] <tinsoldier> Rashad: 02:49Z <LjL>tell Rashad Earlier yesterday when you were talking about allowing or not allowing consonants to meet, and the "grammar" deciding that, you may be interested to know the phonology term for that is https:enwikipediaorgwikiPhonotactics - many languages have "rules" for which sounds can meet in which environments, English is very "anything goes" in this respect
[18:22:42] <Rashad> LjL: Very interesting, thank you!
[18:22:58] <Rashad> rindolf: At work currently... you?
[18:25:13] <pussipupu> There are quite a few English consonant clusters that are illegal in Finnish for instance
[18:27:51] <pussipupu> And in line with what LjL said above, English has some pretty extreme examples, like "strengths" which has a pretty silly cluster at the end :p
[18:30:20] <rindolf> Rashad:  https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/The-10th-Muse/The-10th-Muse--Athena-Gets-Laid.html .
[18:32:45] <huf> pussipupu: it's getting more and more permissive as time goes on though, no?
[18:33:02] <Rashad> rindolf: Are there any phonotactics in Hebrew?
[18:33:15] <huf> it's a thing that exists in every language
[18:34:03] <pussipupu> huf: Finnish?
[18:34:15] <huf> pussipupu: yeh
[18:34:29] <huf> I read somewhere that older people are stricter in what they'll accept
[18:34:33] <huf> eg, initial pr- clusters
[18:35:05] <pussipupu> I'd think so, The Youth (and less young people to a lesser extent) will insert English words and phrases into Finnish speech for rhetorical purposes that often elude me
[18:35:24] <huf> :)
[18:36:20] <huf> pussipupu: probably to replace the swedish words they used to insert for the same reason :)
[18:37:19] <pussipupu> And there are a bunch of recent loans in the spoken language, which often defy conventional phonotactics but from the perspective of an Anglophone are pronounced frankly adorably
[18:37:41] <pussipupu> I hope Finns feel the same when I mangle their language...
[18:38:09] <huf> all I know is, if scanners had existed in the middle ages, we'd probably be calling them "iskenner"
[18:38:30] <Rashad> Some people in Jordan say "Banek" for Bank
[18:39:33] <pussipupu> it's "pankki" in Finnish
[18:39:49] <Rashad> No B in Finnish?
[18:40:04] *** Quits: LuisR14 (~LuisR14@187.143.97.144) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[18:40:07] <pussipupu> because b isn't a real letter and terminal consonant clusters are generally illegal in the standard language
[18:40:11] <pussipupu> right
[18:40:50] <Rashad> Arabic is the opposite: There is B but not P
[18:41:27] <Rashad> So "Penalty" (as in football/soccer penalty are or kick) becomes "Banalty"
[18:41:52] <The_Blode> Hey guys. Quick one. Is this syntactically correct? "If I would, could you?"
[18:42:02] <Rashad> I think yes.
[18:42:06] <pussipupu> Yeah you often get only one of a voiced:unvoiced pair of consonants
[18:42:23] <pussipupu> Yes, though pretty unusual
[18:42:34] <The_Blode> Is it shortened for something?
[18:42:36] <pussipupu> There are contexts it could be reasonably used
[18:42:47] <The_Blode> It's from the Alice song "Would?" it seems cryptic and haunting.
[18:42:50] <The_Blode> I love it but I don't get it.
[18:42:58] <Rashad> Like a kicka&& comback line in a movie.
[18:43:13] <The_Blode> Sometimes it's best to appreciate lyrics that may not have a general meaning right?
[18:44:02] <pussipupu> I read that as "if I left, could you leave" from the context
[18:44:31] <pussipupu> I don't think you should feel obliged to understand lyrics at least, enjoy what you enjoy
[18:44:47] <The_Blode> I love it :)
[18:45:09] <The_Blode> "If I would, could you?" it's the last line of the song with no real context...so cryptic so haunting so Alice
[18:45:21] <The_Blode> Love it. Thanks for chipping in on that.
[18:45:48] <pussipupu> I've used Finnish music to help me learn the language, and on occasion been surprised at what I've been singing along to...
[18:46:17] <pussipupu> "veri on vett√§ makeampaa" for instance is "blood is sweeter than water"
[18:46:41] <The_Blode> Imagine people trying to learn English from listening to Pearl Jam "Freeeezin jibber jibber jibber jibber jibber made of concrete"
[18:47:07] <The_Blode> Oh
[18:47:38] <The_Blode> I don't know any Finnish music or language. I know a few phrases like "Miten menee?" "Hyvin menee" some other things.
[18:50:43] <pussipupu> Well I'm an immigrant so I'm pretty motivated to learn the language, and luckily I've found music I like

[20:47:04] <bin> huf: well i took 2 years of german in college as my foreign language requirement so thats actually really helpful for this lol
[20:47:37] <bin> although onme thing that is throwing me off is sentence structure. i cant tell if it's using english sentence structure or german or neither. it seems to be english structure but i remember german being a little different
[20:47:54] <huf> oh yeah, german is useful for yiddish
[20:47:56] <bin> of course I took 5 years of latin in middle/high school so that throws me off too lol
[20:48:07] <bin> my #1 problem in foreign language besides remembering vocab is sentence structure
[20:48:07] <huf> since they're basically the same thing :)
[20:48:15] <bin> huf: yeah exactly
[20:48:23] <bin> german but in herbew letters is how it seems
[20:48:40] <bin> which honestly is why i'm learning it, i need to re-learn hebrew and this seemed a good way to relearn the basic letters xD
[20:48:54] <bin> ive always known a few yiddish phrases but no idea how to write them hahaha
[20:49:11] <huf> oh yeah it's terrible to read
[20:49:24] <GuiToris> if I were native English, I think I wouldn't learn a foreign language
[20:49:41] <huf> I had ivrit inflicted on me in school and I did not come away with much love for that alphabet :D
[20:49:45] <GuiToris> I would expect everyone to learn my language and make fun of people who make mistakes
[20:50:03] <bin> well foreign language is required in school. I took Spanish in 6th, then Latin the rest of the time. Then German in college because I was edgy and self-hating but actually it was really useful
[20:50:15] <bin> GuiToris: sounds very American of you xD
[20:50:47] <GuiToris> I'm a convert! :D
[20:51:13] <huf> learning a foreign language in school doesnt necessarily mean much
[20:51:46] <bin> ^^
[20:51:54] <bin> yeah I didn't retain enough Latin to be useful
[20:52:08] <bin> but also i resisted a lot
[20:52:12] <bin> ODD is annoying
[20:52:19] <GuiToris> huf, you can get good grades that you can show your parents who give you more money that you can spend on condom
[20:52:20] <huf> people who speak english well here all learned it on their own
[20:52:42] <huf> I guess maybe the school helped a bit? but people who only learned it in school are not very good

[20:56:20] <bin> Idk how I feel about duolingo yet. I know the repetition is necessary but the weird insane sentences are confusing

[20:56:29] <bin> or "a fox in a park"
[20:56:36] <bin> or "mama, a man in a hotel"

[20:57:07] <bin> GuiToris: I don't like flash cards but thank you :D
[20:57:18] <GuiToris> how different is duolingo?
[20:57:32] <GuiToris> I thought it was kind of a same thing
[20:57:36] <bin> kind of
[20:57:46] <bin> but it uses like matching and then translating both ways
[20:57:53] <bin> and there are leaderboards
[20:57:57] <bin> so it's kinda like a game
[20:58:11] <GuiToris> repetition is very important, I keep forgetting words
[20:58:18] <bin> yeah
[20:58:26] <bin> and the hebrew/yiddish letters are hard
[20:58:41] <bin> it's very slowly coming back. I used to know all the letters and be able to read hebrew

[21:00:15] <GuiToris> I know nothing of hebrew, but I assume there are only about 20-30 letters, no?
[21:00:30] <huf> yeah not a lot
[21:00:47] <GuiToris> I'm pretty sure there are more words than letters
[21:00:55] <huf> the spelling is like english though, you cant read the words if you dont already know them :)
[21:01:16] <huf> it achieves this admirable goal very differently of course
[21:01:22] <GuiToris> oh, in that case, good luck bin
[21:01:30] <huf> yiddish spelling might be more regular
[21:02:12] <GuiToris> I think the french spelling is the worst, but I don't know too many languages
[21:02:18] <bin> not a lot, but the forms change and some letters make similar sounds
[21:02:41] <huf> GuiToris: apparently tibetan is worse :)
[21:02:46] <huf> there was a video about it somewhere
[21:02:55] * GuiToris is checking it
[21:02:56] <bin> i also have NVLD so i do everything by finding patterns, so the repetition of the same words is fine and all for memorizing those words, but i just end up memorizing the position of 2 or 3 letters and that's it
[21:03:02] <bin> it doesnt really help me learn other words

[21:50:44] <blkshp> What like... gih-nuh-noringe.
[21:50:46] <blkshp> ?
[21:50:51] <cth> blkshp, but really, about the real words. Language is a tool and being a tool is it's main function. It's also an art, but an art it is only as a supplement. As a tool, it has to evolve. Once it stops, it dies. Greek and Latin languages don't evolve anymore.

[21:52:10] <blkshp> Though I was primarily joking, there are language rules that are accepted as part of standard day to day usage. Of course idiomatic and humerous usage is generally acceptable in normal scenarios, it would be preferred if the language used here were standardised for the people that are here attempting to learn or perfect their usage.
[21:52:36] <cth> blkshp, right, that makes sense.

[23:42:20] <blkshp> or "Whilst working at BestBut I gained a significant amount of experience with Adobe Analytics"
[23:42:45] <cth> well you don't emphasize stuff directly, you use data and make the person do it for you
[23:42:53] <blkshp> I'm sorry but the "I was working..." is poorly structured
[23:43:07] <mdogg> Well, your original sentence highlights 19-months.
[23:43:25] <blkshp> Yes, It highlights that you weren't there even for 2 years.
[23:43:37] <cth> that's a good point
[23:43:48] <cth> what's wrong with using past continuous though
[23:43:54] <cth> why would it be a bad structure
[23:44:01] <blkshp> It sounds childlike
[23:44:12] <cth> oh interesting
[23:44:41] <cth> what other times would sound childlike?
[23:44:51] <blkshp> Excuse me:
[23:44:52] <blkshp> ?
[23:44:56] <cth> future continuous? I'll be doing it for a while

[23:45:57] <mdogg> Your resum√© will provide the detail about your work history so you don't need to include that information in your cover letter as well.

[23:51:01] <cth> cover letter is different

[23:51:34] <mdogg> Ooh - curriculum vitae 
[23:51:37] <blkshp> (should be an and before cover letters too :D)
[23:51:43] <blkshp> mdogg: yup.
[23:51:45] <cth> and the two page limit is a common thing in the west, I guess

[23:52:07] <mdogg> Ok, so it's very similar to a resume.  
[23:52:09] <blkshp> cth: I believe so. I don't want to read too many dry stats before you interview.
[23:52:17] <mdogg> And I agree - resume's should not be longer than 2 pages, either.
[23:52:51] <cth> eh
[23:52:53] <cth> depends
[23:52:56] <blkshp> mdogg: isn't a CV there a more detailed document for higher level roles?
[23:52:56] *** Joins: great_taste (~great_tas@user/great-taste/x-5798414)
[23:53:04] <noord> I don't agree, I never read resume longer than one page long
[23:53:15] <blkshp> xD
[23:53:26] <cth> lol
[23:54:39] <mdogg> noord: I prefer single-page resumes.  Mine is a single page.  But generally, 2 pages would be the the max that most employers like to see for a resume.  
[23:54:53] <blkshp> Are you saying one page duplex?
[23:55:01] <cth> I would say a senior-level resume must be over a page
[23:55:05] <noord> blkshp: one page one sided
[23:55:20] <mdogg> blkshp: I have never written a CV, but from what I find as I'm reading more about them, CV's provide more detail and can run more than 2 pages many times. 
[23:55:29] <blkshp> What's on a resume then?
[23:55:41] <cth> mdogg, what do you do that you've never written one?
[23:56:00] <mdogg> I've written many resume's.  Never written a CV though.
[23:56:30] <cth> no difference between the two
[23:56:41] <blkshp> There is in the US.
[23:56:44] <cth> they're used interchangeably.
[23:56:47] <cth> nah
[23:56:53] <mdogg> Yeah, there seems to be differences.
[23:56:54] <blkshp> Where are you from?
[23:57:05] <blkshp> cth
[23:57:23] <cth> ok, let's say, in 90% of cases, the words are used interchangeably. In 10% of cases, they mean different things
[23:57:35] <cth> but the trend is definitely towards erasing the difference
[23:57:40] <blkshp> In the US they're not used interchangably.
[23:57:50] <cth> I live and work in Canada, Vancouver. But I often work for US too
[23:57:58] <cth> eh
[23:58:43] <spinningCat> !w depart
[23:58:45] <tinsoldier> depart ‚Äî Noun: 1. (obsolete) Division; separation, as of compound substances., 2. (obsolete) A going away; departure., ‚Äî Verb: 1. (intransitive) To leave., 2. (intransitive) To set out on a journey., 3. (intransitive, euphemistic) To die., 4. (intransitive, figuratively) To disappear, vanish; to cease to exist. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/depart
[23:58:49] <blkshp> So you're not from the US, don't live in the US and don't frequently work in the US. that against the multiple native Americans I have spoken to gives them the "home field" advantage :P
[23:59:19] <blkshp> but I do now get the "eh" :D!
[23:59:31] <cth> lol
[23:59:37] <mdogg> What blkshp said is correct.  I have never been asked to provide a CV in the U.S.  If an employer asked for a CV, though, it would not be appropriate to simply send your resume.   This site has a nice simple explanation of the differences   https://www.thebalancecareers.com/cv-vs-resume-2058495
