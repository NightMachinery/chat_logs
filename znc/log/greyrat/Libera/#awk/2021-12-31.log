[20:49:04] <jensen> `/^#/,0{ print }` prints  from first line starting with '#' to end of line. How to print from last occurence of line beginnine with `#` to end of line instead? Or are you better off using tac first for performance and/or simplicity?

[21:03:46] <nmz> you are probably better off using tac
[21:05:43] <nmz> jensen: tac | awk '1; /^#/{exit}'
[21:05:58] <nmz> vs saving the input into an array, then printing that array
[21:06:07] <nmz> etc
[21:06:16] <nmz> tac | awk | tac
[21:08:51] <jensen> ty
[21:11:22] <nmz> tac | awk '/#/ {exit} 1' | tac
[21:11:25] <nmz> did it backwards
[21:11:27] <nmz> woops
[21:11:48] <nmz> /^#/
