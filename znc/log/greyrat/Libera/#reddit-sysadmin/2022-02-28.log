[12:23:40] <Hunterkll> nope, that's one I can confidently say wouldn't be an issue here 
[12:23:48] <Hunterkll> given that they've followed the apache stig properly at any rate
[12:26:41] <Hunterkll> @Gene and don't get me wrong, not educating the guy on what the error means is super bad, but if he's in the service long enough (or deals with DoD in any capacity) he'll automatically be bypassing those errors anyway on his personal devices and consider it normal without reading the error code
[12:27:01] <Hunterkll> it's stupid, it sucks, but the sites you can reach from the outside with those certs aren't on systems that can bridge to anything classified etc

[12:30:13] <sd> 08<G‚Äãene> ah, right
[12:30:36] <Hunterkll> for example, that's how my scom gateways work in untrusted networks to get MP updates and stuff back down to their agents
[12:30:44] <Hunterkll> but we allow it since it's a single path that can be monitored/handled
[12:30:59] <Hunterkll> instead of allowing the entire untrusted network to connect to my SCOM instances, we only have one point of vulnerability

[18:19:45] <Lancehead> !flyfact
[18:19:45] <DoTheNeedful> FLY FACT: House flies defecate‚Ä¶ a lot! And they aren‚Äôt too worried about where they do it either! As you know, house flies like to live off a liquid diet. Because of this, their digestive system can move quite quickly, which means they defecate often. It is speculated that house flies defecate every time they land, even if it‚Äôs on their next meal!

[18:22:10] <PublicWifi> thats smert
[18:22:20] <PublicWifi> wonder how veeam will look for it
[18:22:27] <Lancehead> PublicWifi: What do you think I do with patch panels? 
[18:22:30] <PublicWifi> I doubt itll use the UUID
[18:22:30] <Lancehead> *scissor snipping noise*
[18:22:37] <teh_f4ll3n> step one in solving all Ubuntu issues: rm -rf / --no-preserve-root
[18:22:41] <Lancehead> lol 
[18:22:55] <PublicWifi> LanceScissorHands
[18:22:57] <dunz0r> PublicWifi: Partitions get UUIDs, so it won't be the disk, but the partitions on it. I don't know if you can tell Veeam to mount it by the /dev/disk/by-uuid/<uuid>-symlink
[18:23:07] <Lancehead> Lancehead -> Scissortip 
[18:23:11] <Lancehead> That sounds awfully sexual... 
[18:23:14] <PublicWifi> hmmm I'll get this runing and see how Veeam wants to handle it
[18:23:18] <PublicWifi> then I can adjust my plan haha
[18:23:22] <Lancehead> !scissorfact
[18:23:24] <PublicWifi> prolly should have done that first actually
[18:23:25] <Lancehead> dangit 
[18:23:48] <dunz0r> PublicWifi: As long as you can tell Veeam to use a specific device, uuid should work
[18:24:03] <Lancehead> I just got so stupidly hungry holy crap  
[18:24:08] <dunz0r> As in it isn't picky about it having to be in /dev directly and be named something specific.
[18:24:08] <SirSceptalot> Lancehead, were you hoping to get info on the tool to cut paper, or....
[18:24:17] <Lancehead> No, the lesbian act 
[18:24:25] <dunz0r> I've used Veeam before, but I only used NFS-mounts with it
[18:24:36] <SirSceptalot> hm? I was going to say scissor lifts
[18:24:42] <Lancehead> Oh 
[18:24:44] <Lancehead> yeah that!
[18:24:50] <SirSceptalot> what was the other thing?

[18:24:58] <Lancehead> nothing, nothing

[18:25:45] <teh_f4ll3n> seen only in fiction footage

[18:27:51] <Lancehead> ...like pop rocks 
[18:27:52] <arlion> This just in: all lesbians have been relabled to "girl friends with benefits"
[18:28:35] <SirSceptalot> Lancehead, I dunno but I sometimes get that sound when yawning or something
[18:29:08] <Lancehead> It feels super fucking weird 
[18:29:12] <SirSceptalot> I also snap crackle and pop like a sum'bitch when I get up in the morning but that's probably unrelated

[19:13:36] <XV8> I have PTT bindings in mumble
[19:14:15] <PattyCakes> I think I setup my first vent in 04, I was I think 11
[19:14:21] <XV8> The last time I used Teamspeak it was a few years ago when I was pretty active on Planetside 2 for our outfit. 
[19:14:33] <mistiry> first "voice" stuff i did online was Microsoft NetMeeting :/
[19:14:36] <nx032> this is the best mouse in existence https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-M7J-00001-Wireless-Desktop-2000/dp/B004SUO1QM
[19:14:42] <PattyCakes> on man Planetside. I spent so much money in that 
[19:15:01] <nx032> planetside 2 was so good at the beggining
[19:15:04] <XV8> I don't know how to feel about it now. 
[19:15:05] <PattyCakes> so good
[19:15:20] <dunz0r> nx032: Nah. MS Intellimouse 3.0 is the best mouse ever
[19:15:21] <PattyCakes> XV8 and I think it's more than a few years now :P
[19:15:23] <Oliber> i tried playing planetside2, but my dsl was so bad at the time that it would lag out every 30s
[19:15:25] <PattyCakes> I think it's been a literal decade
[19:15:30] <nx032> beginning*, then after the ships update came in it went south, it was nearly impossible to level up
[19:15:31] <PattyCakes> wasn't that 2012?
[19:15:34] <XV8> Now it's just a bunch of NS shop robots running around with NS weapons
[19:15:42] <Oliber> i never got around to the new one
[19:15:42] <XV8> PattyCakes I think so
[19:15:50] <PattyCakes> yea, that'd be a decade ago :P
[19:15:50] <XV8> god im getting old
[19:16:11] <PattyCakes> The Soviet Union fell in 1991
[19:16:14] <PattyCakes> are you ready for this?
[19:16:17] <PattyCakes> that was over 30 years ago

[19:18:01] <dunz0r> Weird to have a that 00s show. A that 90s show though
[19:18:10] <mistiry> They are doing a reboot
[19:18:12] <dunz0r> It feels like that much hasn't changed since 00
[19:18:34] <PattyCakes> We can't have a that 90s show. The 90s was just being blissfully unaware how bad things were becoming
[19:18:36] <mistiry> starring Red and Kitty and a new generation of kids, i guess kids of the OG cast not sure
[19:18:42] <PattyCakes> It would be ironic in the worst of ways
[19:18:47] <dunz0r> But that's probably because I was a teenager in the early 00s.
[19:19:05] <mistiry> a That 90s Show is already in the works :D
[19:19:07] <dunz0r> PattyCakes: It wasn't really though. There was a lot of shit then as well. You just don't remember it because you were too young
[19:19:18] <PattyCakes> oh no doubt dunz0r 
[19:19:22] <dunz0r> mistiry: That could work. With all the weird fashion trends from the 90s

[19:20:50] <mistiry> PattyCakes: told a coworker the other day - when you're younger, you dont want to be the youngest in the group. when you get older, you're just happy when you're not the oldest in the group.
[19:21:00] <PattyCakes> being in my career since 19, everytime I jumped ships it was for bigger roles of which I'd be the youngest on the team

[19:29:42] <mistiry> put all the discs into it
[19:29:44] <dunz0r> PattyCakes: I think this had an aux-port as an option actually. The CD-player takes MP3-CDs even.

[21:20:47] <vinrock> The F150 is the best selling pickup, but compares to shitboxes it cant compare in sales
[21:21:02] <PattyCakes> US, per month, average is 60k
[21:21:17] <vinrock> which is still a rediculous number imo
[21:21:18] <PattyCakes> summer months sell better, average is 85k in summer
[21:21:32] <teh_f4ll3n> OK, I was a bit wrong. it's 35k-90k per month
[21:21:41] <PattyCakes> It Is the Lifeblood of Ford
[21:21:41] <PattyCakes> Ford sells 2,452 F-Series trucks every single day. That's 102 trucks an hour, which means that nearly two people buy an F-150 every minute of every day, seven days a week, 24 hours a day.
[21:21:56] <vinrock> according to my experience in the deep south, you are required to own an F150 
[21:21:57] <vinrock> it's the law
[21:22:10] <PattyCakes> Live in Houston, Own an F150, can confirm
[21:22:31] <PattyCakes> First vehicle was an F150
[21:22:35] <teh_f4ll3n> Houston and only F150? no F350?
[21:22:38] <PattyCakes> Then I bought a 2014 dodge dart
[21:22:51] <PattyCakes> crashed that fucker into a center dividing wall at 80mph, totalled it
[21:22:51] <vinrock> yikes
[21:22:58] <PattyCakes> best accident ever
[21:23:04] <PattyCakes> cause I paid WAYYYY too much for that car
[21:23:04] <vinrock> you got lucky
[21:23:13] <vinrock> dart/200
[21:23:13] <PattyCakes> and the maintaiance on that 1.4l Turbo
[21:23:14] <vinrock> oh boy
[21:23:15] <PattyCakes> fuck that
[21:23:16] <PattyCakes> yea
[21:23:17] <vinrock> those were rough
[21:23:32] <PattyCakes> I got my 2016 F150 in 2018
[21:23:36] <teh_f4ll3n> first vehicle was a Honda
[21:23:43] <teh_f4ll3n> CBR125R
[21:23:49] <vinrock> i had a 1988 mazda 323 tgat smelled like shit
[21:23:50] <PattyCakes> it was a CPO, I wanted the platinum model with the 5.0 coyotee
[21:23:54] <PattyCakes> fuck that ecoboost shit
[21:24:07] <vinrock> one of the fellas here just got a roush f150 with the v8
[21:24:18] <PattyCakes> and if the car market wasn't retarded today, what I paid for it in 2018 was retarded
[21:24:22] <PattyCakes> I bought a 2 year old truck for 50k
[21:24:27] <PattyCakes> today? truck is worth 47k
[21:24:53] <PattyCakes> was actually beginning of 2019 not 2018
[21:24:56] <PattyCakes> so a 3 year old truck off lease
[21:25:12] <vinrock> i havent looked at what my car is worth
[21:25:17] <vinrock> i dont want to tempt myself to do something dumb
[21:25:32] <PattyCakes> I go on carvana, vroom, carmax and autotrader almost every month
[21:25:33] <PattyCakes> for the last year

[23:31:18] <thegodsquirrel> Its the diabetes
[23:31:28] <sintax> dia-beat-us
[23:31:45] <sintax> thegodsquirrel: i don't know what it is but i bet i won't be in here tomorrow with these idiots. 
[23:32:14] <PublicWifi> bro this switch only has VLAN 1 assigned on this port
[23:32:25] <PublicWifi> how the fuck is it passing otehr VLAN traffic xDD
[23:32:26] <sintax> random dhcp allowing it to work?
[23:32:27] <thegodsquirrel> lulz
[23:32:35] <PublicWifi> something is fucky
[23:32:38] <sintax> or you've been hacked by russia
[23:32:41] <PublicWifi> rip
[23:33:08] <sd> 05<v‚Äãyz> damn ruskis
[23:33:17] <nx032> its the infosec people theyre doing fucky things again
[23:33:36] <sintax> probably happy to be sweating in an office hiding from end users
[23:34:01] <thegodsquirrel> somebodies got a DD-WRT router setup in the warehouse playing Quake 3 Arena on company time!!
[23:34:46] <PublicWifi> im a little concerned atm
[23:34:55] <PublicWifi> xDD
[23:35:03] <sintax> fake it till you make it
[23:35:04] <thegodsquirrel> Rogue DHCP server, call in IR
[23:35:22] <sintax> sweaty infosec nerds to the rescue
[23:35:25] <PublicWifi> nah DHCP matches the VLAN subnet LOL
[23:35:26] <thegodsquirrel> Call Mandiant, no matter how much it costs!
[23:35:39] <PublicWifi> so... is there some VLAN bullshitery that nanostations can do?
[23:35:42] <thegodsquirrel> Oh well that is fine then
[23:35:46] <PublicWifi> some network black magic I have no idea about?
[23:36:00] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> nx032 is the kind of sysadmin to expose port 3389 to the internet
[23:36:03] <sintax> welcome to networking!
[23:36:07] <thegodsquirrel> They should be a transparent bridge PublicWifi 
[23:36:10] <PublicWifi> they are
[23:36:24] <PublicWifi> which means the in my network rack should only be allowing vlan1 through atm
[23:36:30] <thegodsquirrel> Do you have a DHCP relay or some shit 
[23:36:33] <PublicWifi> the port isn't a trunk, just looked
[23:36:42] <sintax> !DNS
[23:36:45] <PublicWifi> xD
[23:36:51] <thegodsquirrel> !penis
[23:37:10] <PublicWifi> no relay
[23:37:12] <PublicWifi> lmfao
[23:37:47] <PublicWifi> i dont think...
[23:37:53] <nx032> bdenlinger, wrong, i expose them all so i never have to deal with blocked ports stopping my unreal tournament sesh
[23:38:36] <PublicWifi> no relay
[23:38:41] <PublicWifi> what the actual fuck is happening
[23:38:43] <PublicWifi> LOL
[23:39:17] <thegodsquirrel> Is there a loop?
[23:39:33] <PublicWifi> not that I'm aware of
[23:39:42] <PublicWifi> its just a wireless bridge to a building outside
[23:39:49] <PublicWifi> connected to 1 port on our switch stack
[23:39:50] <nx032> actually kinda funny you say that, the MSP that was handling the IT for this company before did that during my first few days here. According to Azure a botnet brute forced and had a successful login, according to them it doesnt mean anything, we'll go with that lol
[23:40:19] <thegodsquirrel> so just building A (main segment) >>>>>nanostation bridge to >>>>>>Building B 
[23:40:27] <PublicWifi> i know the vlan is setup proper cause my guest network didn't pass traffic until I setup the vlan correctly inside here
[23:40:30] <PublicWifi> yup
[23:40:34] <PublicWifi> in a transparent bridge
[23:40:39] <thegodsquirrel> hmmm
[23:40:47] <PublicWifi> my ubiquiti APs have 2 SSIDs, one for guest
[23:40:50] <PublicWifi> which is on a VLAN
[23:41:05] <PublicWifi> so the new building has uiquiti APs as well
[23:41:07] <thegodsquirrel> Are the APs configured with the incorrect VLAN?
[23:41:26] <PublicWifi> lemme duoble check but its all controlled via the unifi controller
[23:41:36] <PublicWifi> I mean the DHCP server for that VLAN is picking up the devices somehow
[23:41:46] <int0x1C8> oh man PublicWifi it sucked trying to get our guest net setup on an isolated VLAN
[23:42:13] <PublicWifi> it was working perfect until I added this bridge
[23:42:22] <PublicWifi> somehow the wireless bridge network is passing traffic xDDD
[23:43:13] <PublicWifi> it behaved exactly like it should when I set it all up in the main building last year
[23:43:37] <thegodsquirrel> Maybe the Nanostations are stripping the VLAN tags?
[23:43:47] <thegodsquirrel> Are they in the default setting?
[23:43:55] <PublicWifi> yeah but then again if that was happening why wouldn't they get dhcp leases from my prod network them
[23:44:04] <PublicWifi> the guest network devices are getting gust network leases
[23:44:15] <thegodsquirrel> hmmmm
[23:44:22] <PublicWifi> lemme check the nanostations again right quick
[23:44:51] <PublicWifi> on my switch the bridge traffic is going through port Gi2/0/2
[23:45:00] <PublicWifi> port Gi2/0/2 belongs to one VLAN, VLAn 1 lol
[23:45:04] *** Quits: djhankb (~djhankb@208.113.164.68) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[23:47:34] <PublicWifi> WAIT
[23:47:47] <PublicWifi> okay here some black magic fuckery I need to know if it matters
[23:47:55] <PublicWifi> the user would have already had a lease from inside te main building
[23:48:01] <PublicWifi> and then went outside
[23:48:13] <PublicWifi> but still.. wouldn't the traffic not pass anyway?
[23:48:28] <PublicWifi> ima go connect my phone down there and see what happens I guess
[23:52:46] <PublicWifi> okay that was the issue
[23:52:48] <PublicWifi> PHEW
[23:52:50] <PublicWifi> NO RUSSIAN HACKERS
[23:53:22] * thegodsquirrel was convinced it was the GRU
[23:55:51] <PublicWifi> all is well in the world now boys
[23:56:09] <sintax> i wasn't worried
[23:56:10] <thegodsquirrel> Well, what was the issue
[23:56:11] <sintax> you got this
[23:56:57] <PublicWifi> the user was already connect to the wifi in the main building
[23:57:05] <PublicWifi> then walked down to the new building
[23:57:10] <PublicWifi> so he already had a lease
[23:57:28] <sintax> neat
[23:57:34] <PublicWifi> my phone, which didn't have the wifi connected, wasn't able to connect down there
[23:57:44] <PublicWifi> its some black magic, I didn't know this would bypass a vlan group 
[23:57:52] <PublicWifi> im sure someone here can explain why lol
[23:59:08] <sintax> top threats by classification: TOR
[23:59:18] <sintax> quit trying to get me to tor. weirdos
[23:59:38] <sintax> yay unifi
[23:59:58] <sd> 06<N‚ÄãinjaStyle> what do you mean it bypassed a vlan group?
