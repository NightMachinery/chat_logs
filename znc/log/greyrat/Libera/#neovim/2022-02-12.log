[00:00:00] <senoraraton> The suggestions address a problem that at least temporarily no longer exists.
[00:00:31] <senoraraton> The problem now is, if nvim knows where the shada file is located, and it creates it, why isn't it doing the thing its supposed to do.  Changing where its stored, or even resetting it to default isn't going to solve that problem.

[00:00:52] <clason[m]> oh, you sweet summer child...
[00:01:21] <sunjonSenghanBri> however, it seems some clever framework user decided to use it as an optimization; turn off shada, and re-enable it after plugin load to save 1ms

[00:03:19] <senoraraton> This whole subsystem does not seem very well documented/supported
[00:03:42] <sunjonSenghanBri> I have a mem.... oh wait
[00:04:14] <sunjonSenghanBri> focus on the XDG setup.
[00:04:19] <senoraraton> Why>?
[00:04:29] <sunjonSenghanBri> setting it up in your bashrc, isn't as straight forward as you think
[00:04:49] <senoraraton> I honestly don't understand why it is necessary.  If Nvim creates a main.shada file, then Nvim knows where the main.shada file is, and it should load it?
[00:05:02] <sunjonSenghanBri> you'll probably want conditions for login shell, and probably want it before shell is even invoked
[00:05:22] <clason[m]> senoraraton: yes, so?
[00:05:29] <senoraraton> It is not.
[00:05:40] <clason[m]> so something is going wrong on your end
[00:05:44] <senoraraton> Also :wsh and :rsh don't work.
[00:05:57] <clason[m]> which is impossible to diagnose from here, with the limited information

[00:06:03] <clason[m]> all I can say is that it works fine for me
[00:06:20] <clason[m]> always test with `nvim --clean`, in case it wasn't obvious
[00:06:23] <senoraraton> And all you need to configure is to have a shada and shadafile set?
[00:06:37] <clason[m]> just the `shadafile`
[00:06:38] <sunjonSenghanBri> throw away the location customisation, and I'm 100% sure the file gets created and is writable
[00:06:42] <clason[m]> I don't touch `'shada'`

[00:06:59] <senoraraton> Sure, I'll just let it default.
[00:07:12] <sunjonSenghanBri> and `:rsh` works now?
[00:07:19] <senoraraton> Which means if I just delete my configs or comment them out, its "supposed" to just work

[00:08:15] <sunjonSenghanBri> no, that's custom per `:mksession`
[00:08:18] <clason[m]> window state? no

[11:36:35] <numToStr[m]> `files` is lua table (converted from vim list) so you need a lua api to check it thus `vim.tbl_isempty()`
[11:37:03] <ambasta> It is? glob({expr} [, {nosuf} [, {list} [, {alllinks}]]])		glob()

[21:28:52] <clason[m]> it does what it says on the tin
[21:28:57] <janschneider[m]> can u scope lsp to certain project-folders?
[21:29:12] <clason[m]> well, yes, that's the whole point
[21:29:19] <clason[m]> you have to fight not to do that
[21:29:44] <clason[m]> it pays to (try to) read the actual LSP spec
[21:29:58] <clason[m]> to understand what these terms (which are technical terms!) mean
[21:30:10] <mjlbach[m]> Workspace folders specify what the server indexes
[21:30:21] <clason[m]> essentially, a workspace contains the project
[21:30:38] <clason[m]> as well as any "external" libraries you want indexed
[21:30:54] <mjlbach[m]> So if you have a multi-root project you can add all of the workspace folders, then you get navigation across all workspace folders
[21:30:56] <clason[m]> (so you get signature help for functions outside your own project)
[21:30:58] <janschneider[m]> so normally u would use `vim.lsp.buf.remove_workspace_folder()` to make "lsp not to use the 'bin' folder"
[21:31:08] <mjlbach[m]> that doesn't make sense
[21:31:31] <clason[m]> no, you'd use it to tell the server "I want you to also index this library that I'm using in my own code that you otherwise no nothing about"
[21:31:40] <clason[m]> s/no/know/
[21:31:52] <janschneider[m]> ok
[21:32:16] <mjlbach[m]> Right now there isn't a good way to leverage it since we don't have a "projects" mechanism, basically lspconfig tries to guess the correct (single) workspace folder
[21:32:16] <clason[m]> what the server does with that information very much depends on the server

[22:05:47] <maix522[m]> When I say it works, the lsp server is launched and the client is started (I think due to the absence of error in the logs)

[22:06:45] <mjlbach[m]> No errors in the logs means very little

[22:13:59] <mjlbach[m]> Ah yes
[22:14:01] <mjlbach[m]> nixos
[22:14:38] <mjlbach[m]> This works 100% fine for me on a project I created via unity on a standard FHS compliant distro (fedora)
[22:14:48] <mjlbach[m]> if you are on nix you can try in a container or with buildFHSUserEnv
[22:15:11] <maix522[m]> I will try this thanks :D

[22:15:33] <mjlbach[m]> oh that file I sent you bootstraps it's config into /tmp so it should not clobber your config
[22:16:02] <mjlbach[m]> you can run it with nvim -u init.lua, although if you're on nix fzf-native won't compile unless you have the gcc toolchain in your default profile (which you shouldn't)

[22:17:30] <DavidMilestone>  I'm trying to map the `Ctrl + Alt + N`combination to run C files.
[22:17:31] <DavidMilestone> `map <C-A-n> :w <CR> :!gcc % -o %< && ./%< <CR>`
[22:17:31] <DavidMilestone> It is not working and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here.

[22:18:41] <clason[m]> does it work if
[22:18:41] <clason[m]> 1. you use a simpler lhs, like `<c-a>`
[22:18:41] <clason[m]> 2. you enter this command on the command line?
[22:18:55] <clason[m]> s///, s/a/n/
[22:19:56] <DavidMilestone> Yes. It's on the command line
[22:20:09] <clason[m]> no, I mean the rhs
[22:20:20] <DavidMilestone> That's in command mode
[22:20:23] <clason[m]> what you want executed when you trigger the mapping
[22:20:31] <DavidMilestone> I want to see the output of the program
[22:20:42] <clason[m]> I mean the exact sequence of keys
[22:20:42] <DavidMilestone> That's why there's the `./` at the end
[22:20:52] <clason[m]> I don't care :)
[22:20:58] <DavidMilestone> wow
[22:21:18] <clason[m]> the question is "is it the _mapping_ or the _command_ that's not working?"
[22:21:28] <DavidMilestone> The mapping is working and the command is not
[22:21:52] <clason[m]> so the question is not about the mapping but about the command.
[22:22:12] <DavidMilestone> Yes

[22:22:50] <clason[m]> right. so I suspect you're following something that was written for Vim
[22:23:03] <clason[m]> which has a very different terminal implementation than Neovim
[22:23:21] <DavidMilestone> Yes, I had this in my _vimrc file
[22:24:09] <clason[m]> right. and that won't work in Neovim
[22:24:28] <DavidMilestone> What should I do then?
[22:24:52] <clason[m]> I use the built-in terminal for such things
[22:25:39] *** Quits: yamchah2 (~yamchah2@user/yamchah2) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:25:48] <clason[m]> other people probably use `makeprg` or similar
[22:25:54] *** Joins: yamchah2 (~yamchah2@user/yamchah2)
[22:26:02] <DavidMilestone> Yep, it's working with `:terminal` but that's taking 10s to load the terminal
[22:26:34] <clason[m]> that is one slow terminal then
[22:26:44] <DavidMilestone> Yep, with WSL
[22:27:33] <clason[m]> you probably want to look into plugins then
[22:28:25] <clason[m]> something like https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch (not sure if that works in Neovim, though)

[22:30:34] <clason[m]> other people may be able to give better options for this
[22:30:45] <clason[m]> I only replied because of the mapping ;)
[22:30:51] <DavidMilestone> Got it
[22:31:03] <DavidMilestone> Is there a reliable plugin for an integrated terminal? I can see there's one plugin `vim-terminal` and it does what I want, but I want to ensure that there are no other options left before using that plugin.
[22:31:17] <clason[m]> there is an integrated terminal, period
[22:31:27] <clason[m]> `:h :terminal`
[22:31:30] <nvim-bot[m]> * [`:terminal`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/various.html#:terminal) in *various.txt*
[22:32:10] <DavidMilestone> I've tried `:terminal` and it runs in a separate window
[22:32:22] <clason[m]> no?
[22:32:55] <clason[m]> it should just start a terminal with your shell in the current split.
[22:33:02] <DavidMilestone> oh
