[04:21:49] <artao> k
[04:21:51] <morlog> go for the ones people are giving away for free on craigslist
[04:22:02] <morlog> its how i got my recumbent
[04:22:04] <artao> so ... what part of them is hitting the freakin frame?
[04:22:06] <artao> and how?
[04:22:07] <artao> huh?
[04:22:12] <artao> the tire? sure. rim? maybe
[04:22:16] <morlog> they wanted it gone and just gave it to me for free
[04:22:19] <artao> but the FRAME? 
[04:22:22] <artao> WTAF no
[04:22:24] <Panther> Like the whole front piece that loks sorta like a wishbone that's held on by a bolt is loose.
[04:22:30] <artao> that's BAD bad if the brake is hitting the frame
[04:22:32] <artao> pics?
[04:22:44] <morlog> whats it taste like
[04:22:46] <artao> ah mk. sounds like center pull brakes

[04:22:59] <artao> morlog your balls
[04:23:02] <artao> !BAM!

[04:23:14] <morlog> s/rims/corns/
[04:23:14] <Janet> morlog thinks Panther meant to say: Those are down by the corns.
[04:23:50] <artao> <Panther> When I activate it, it slams into the frams while the pads are trying to stop the rims.
[04:23:52] <Panther> But there is a big spring-loaded plier-like set of arms that control the brakes when you pull on the cable.
[04:23:55] <artao> plz elaborate
[04:24:11] <morlog> what kind of brakes again
[04:24:16] <artao> I suspect miscommunication
[04:24:19] <artao> center pull morlog
[04:24:19] <Panther> Those big plier like arms bash into the frame front when the brakjes catch.
[04:24:20] <morlog> do they have clowns
[04:24:25] <artao> unless he described them wrong
[04:24:38] <artao> okay ... now it sounds like side-pull

[04:25:48] <morlog> or v brakes
[04:25:50] <Panther> Ok, see that braking system?
[04:25:51] <artao> a sads morlog morf and other corn lovers
[04:25:55] <artao> the corn has been cut
[04:26:02] <artao> i can no longer film my movie this year :(
[04:26:04] <Panther> That is essentially what this has.
[04:26:14] <morlog> those are v-brakes
[04:26:24] <artao> and next year they'll grow soy in that field, so i'll hafta find a different field further away
[04:26:31] <artao> ... easy peasy, of course. they're all over
[04:26:32] <artao> lol
[04:26:38] <morlog> your cable might be stuck and catching
[04:26:43] <artao> EW!!
[04:26:50] <artao> oh wait no
[04:26:57] <morlog> if its pulling one side into the frame and the other into the tire
[04:26:58] <Panther> When thiose brake pads catch, that whole metal apparatus smaches back into the frame.
[04:27:03] <artao> i saw the fork stabilizer as the brakes LOL
[04:27:03] <artao> mk
[04:27:05] <artao> center pull
[04:27:10] <artao> so what part hits the frame
[04:27:14] <artao> that should never happen
[04:27:26] <artao> the "whole"
[04:27:27] <artao> um
[04:27:35] <artao> can you wiggle it by hand?
[04:27:39] <morlog> check the springs in them and see if the mounting bolts are in tight enough
[04:27:47] <artao> cuz this is sounding like a broken brake post
[04:27:49] <Panther> https://images1.americanlisted.com/nlarge/huffy-rocktrail-road-bike-w-52cm-frame-140-davis-americanlisted_29735885.jpg
[04:28:02] <artao> spring or not morlog, it should never hit the FRAME
[04:28:04] <artao> wtf is that?
[04:28:06] <artao> o.O
[04:28:15] <Panther> That is even a better pic, cuz the whole thing is held on by that one bolt.

[04:28:23] <Janet> ^ Flashdance - Imagination ( video sountrack ).mpg - YouTube
[04:28:30] <artao> the brake posts keep it parallel to the fork
[04:28:33] <morlog> if the spring is popping out of its mount hole it could make the brakes snap back like that
[04:28:38] <artao> it CAN'T hit the frame
[04:28:45] <artao> um
[04:28:47] <artao> Panther
[04:28:48] <Panther> That is the bike I have, tho not those handlebars.
[04:28:57] <morlog> have you ever taken brakes like that off a bike before
[04:28:57] <artao> that's a different type of brake entierly LOL
[04:29:07] <morlog> cool
[04:29:09] <Panther> i have to every time I take the wheels off.
[04:29:14] <Panther> Well
[04:29:25] <Panther> I could just loosen everythiung, etcv
[04:29:31] <Panther> But I take them off.
[04:29:43] <artao> those look like caliper brakes, but it's hard to tell what sort from that side view
[04:29:51] <morlog> check to see if you got the springs in the hole right
[04:29:57] <Panther> I leave the cables alone, tho.. those cables work 100%
[04:30:03] <artao> regardless, it shouldn't even BE ABLE TO "hit the frame"
[04:30:08] <Panther> I kn[w
[04:30:16] <Panther> I wanted to find a head on shot
[04:30:21] <morlog> shouldnt have to mess with the cables after they are set unless you loosen it
[04:30:26] <artao> plz quickly create an animation showing exactly what happens and share the video
[04:30:29] <artao> you've got 5 min
[04:30:29] <macrobat> the wheels are smaller? longer brake arms? maybe that's the reason?
[04:30:30] <artao> hehe
[04:30:32] <artao> :P
[04:30:49] <artao> are the brake arms fully tightened to the brake posts?
[04:30:53] <artao> are they bent?
[04:31:20] <artao> Panther i don't think you replied to this

[04:31:21] <Panther> You know the tube that the steering column goes down?
[04:31:23] <artao> which one?
[04:31:30] <artao> clear layout of all but disc brakes
[04:31:40] <artao> yes. the head tube
[04:31:50] <Panther> The one in the front of the bike where you connect the fork and the handlebars.
[04:31:54] <artao> i need to catch up on reading here quick
[04:31:55] *** Quits: mestre (~mestre@191.177.175.57) (Quit: Lost terminal)
[04:31:59] <artao> yes. Head Tube
[04:32:04] <Panther> That is what it hist
[04:32:07] <Panther> hitsa
[04:32:09] <artao> um
[04:32:11] <Panther> hits
[04:32:18] <artao> .... the brake hits the head tube ....
[04:32:23] <Panther> cuz it is right near that.
[04:32:34] <artao> that ... shouldn't be possible
[04:32:35] <artao> o.O
[04:32:37] <morlog> too tall
[04:32:38] <Panther> The metal arms that control the brakes do.
[04:32:39] <artao> wtaf
[04:32:55] <Panther> The brakes can't.... the brakes are down by the rims.
[04:33:03] <morlog> check out cantilever brakes
[04:33:07] <artao> um
[04:33:14] <artao> i have NO IDEA what to say about that
[04:33:15] <morlog> they are almost as good as vbrakes
[04:33:18] <artao> go take pics quick
[04:33:21] <artao> it can't take long
[04:33:23] <morlog> way lower profile
[04:33:28] <Panther> I gues they could hit the fork, but they are going in the wrong direction for that.
[04:33:36] <artao> how far away from your bike are you? 5 meters? 10?
[04:33:47] <Panther> dunno
[04:33:49] <artao> it'll take you less than 2 min to take pics and upload
[04:33:59] <artao> i'm VERY VERY curious WTAF is going on now
[04:33:59] <Panther> Not reallt
[04:33:59] <morlog> how far are your balls
[04:34:00] <artao> LOL

[04:34:08] <artao> *pics
[04:34:21] <Panther> It;s dark in here, and also you want hear on shots, and angles, and lighting, etc.. then it has to u/l and d/l etc...

[04:35:02] <Panther> I think tho the best thing to do is to tghten the bolt that holds the brake assembly on.
[04:35:05] <artao> PICK ONE PLEASE
[04:35:07] <artao> lol
[04:35:13] <artao> my brain is afire here

[04:38:15] <Panther> This is to much.
[04:38:15] <artao> i have never replaced my brake pads
[04:38:28] <morlog> just staple your pants to your seat
[04:38:36] <artao> they're a bit asymmetrically worn, but still work GREAT
[04:38:48] <artao> morlog are you familiar with Avid Single Digit series brakes?
[04:38:51] <Panther> Me either, and I ridr parkour cycling.
[04:38:57] <morlog> ive taken small blankets and wraped them around seats to give them padding
[04:39:03] <artao> .... parkour cycling ...
[04:39:10] <artao> .... you mean trials riding?
[04:39:12] <artao> lol
[04:39:35] <artao> the spring assembly at the brake post is broken on one side of my rear brake :(
[04:39:44] <artao> they don't really sell the single replacement parts
[04:39:45] <artao> :(
[04:39:47] <Panther> Like.. if cars, syclists or peds get in my way, I fly around them, jump curbs, ride over lawns, go wrong wat down 10way dtreets, ride on the sidewalk, cut off cars that take too long....
[04:39:48] <louipcD> /s/arkou/owe/

[04:40:21] <artao> and you're jumping curbs and shit?
[04:40:28] <artao> you need a "gravel bike"

[04:41:04] <artao> you are endangering your life on that thing
[04:41:06] <artao> srsly
[04:41:09] <artao> 100%
[04:41:17] <morlog> huffy makes good bikes
[04:41:17] <louipcD> lol why
[04:41:23] <artao> Huffy == terrible and potentially dangerous
[04:41:25] <Panther> Huffy when it was made in the USA has a frame build like a Sherman tank.
[04:41:27] <artao> no they don't morlog
[04:41:28] <morlog> they hold up
[04:41:31] <artao> they OWN good brands
[04:41:37] <artao> but Huffy BRAND? nope
[04:41:41] <morlog> compared to all the other cheap brands
[04:41:42] <macrobat> I was about to bid on a carbon fibre bike, but it's too fancy. what if I scrape it :(
[04:41:44] <Panther> artao
[04:41:45] <morlog> they last
[04:41:46] <artao> IIRC they now own Mongoose
[04:41:49] <artao> GREAT brand
[04:41:51] <Panther> That is because Walmart bought it
[04:41:57] <morlog> huffy owns schwinn
[04:42:01] <louipcD> buff it out then
[04:42:02] <artao> Huffy has always been crap
[04:42:08] <morlog> biggest bike company in the world
[04:42:10] <Panther> Huffy was great 25+ years ago, and it is nt.
[04:42:20] <artao> especially if you do anything besides just bike on the road or simple offroad
[04:42:30] <Panther> Ok, ,welll.. guess what.. I don't care what you think of it.
[04:42:35] <artao> frames break. forks break. bolts let loose
[04:42:39] <artao> srsly
[04:42:44] <artao> Huffy = bad
[04:42:53] <Panther> I tore the derailleure off a bike, and snapped the chan just going up a hill.. this Huffy kicks ass.
[04:42:57] <morlog> you dont need a fancy expensive bike to ride
[04:43:01] <artao> a Mongoose at Walmart (ew, shudder .. use Amazon instead even)
[04:43:04] <artao> under 400
[04:43:10] <artao> maybe even 200
[04:43:14] <Panther> No way
[04:43:17] <Panther> This is better
[04:43:19] <artao> 10x better than Huffy, even if Huffy owns them
[04:43:24] <Panther> Prove it
[04:43:24] <morlog> academy has the good mongoose bikes here
[04:43:28] <Panther> Bring it here
[04:43:32] <artao> huffy brakes if you push it
[04:43:33] <Panther> Bring it on
[04:43:37] <morlog> the walmart ones were made with crappier parts
[04:43:37] <artao> also, heavy af
[04:43:41] <Panther> I push it dude
[04:43:42] <artao> terrible brakes
[04:43:50] <artao> at LEAST rejplace the brakes
[04:43:59] <Panther> I don't care how heavy it is, I drag 700lb sleds. :P
[04:44:16] <artao> for the love of monkeys PLEASE replace the brakes
[04:44:38] <morlog> im amazed the recumbent i ride is lighter than all the mountain bikes ive had
[04:44:48] <Panther> I was going to, but now the wear pattern looks so kewl, I don't want to spoil it.

[04:49:53] <morlog> probably going to be close to 100lbs
[04:50:00] <macrobat> less mud on discs than rims when you ride through mud

[04:50:13] <artao> ehhh .... arguable macrobat
[04:50:17] <artao> arguable
[04:50:24] <morlog> but mud
[04:50:52] <artao> especially if you put a mud-clearer in front of the brake pads. just a simple piece of stiff-butt-flexible plastic
[04:50:57] <artao> a scraper
[04:50:59] <macrobat> but what if you spray oil on your chain and accidentally on your disc. wont you have to replace it?

[04:51:09] <Janet> morlog thinks macrobat meant to say: butt what if you spray oil on your chain and accidentally on your disc. wont you have to replace it?
[04:51:20] <artao> especially with good linear pulls properly set up, cuz there's only like 1-2mm clearance with those
[04:51:28] <morlog> itll just get squeeky
[04:51:40] <artao> and decent brake pads QUICKLY clear any ..... obstructions
[04:51:48] <morlog> ever spray paint your rims
[04:51:57] <macrobat> :(
[04:52:08] <artao> accidentally spray oil on ANY brake macrobat and you BEST clean that brake if you want to stop lol
[04:52:14] <morlog> its like fingernails down a chalkboard

[04:53:19] <morlog> also the bike vibrates when you hit the brakes
[04:53:26] <artao> the goal is to cause headaches and nausea
[04:53:35] <artao> ...... which means that WORKING ON IT will do that
[04:53:43] <artao> making it nigh impossible to work on

[04:54:00] <artao> cool in concept, but good luck DOING it
[04:54:01] <artao> lol

[07:10:27] <artao> ^^ if you can translate that your IQ is near mine
[07:10:35] <artao> which is around 155
[07:10:48] <artao> by EVERY test i've taken in my entire life
[07:11:12] <artao> YOU choose the IQ test
[07:11:33] <artao> the problem with being at that level?
[07:11:39] <artao> OVERTHINKING
[07:12:05] <artao> especially in combination with mental issues such as bipolar disorder
[07:12:31] <artao> sometimes i spend mo9re time in my head than the "real world"
[07:12:37] <artao> even while awake
[07:12:54] <artao> i've usually got 2 or 3 ......... hmm
[07:13:07] <artao> 2 or 3 "lines of thought" i guess?
[07:13:11] <artao> anyhow
[07:13:33] <artao> my brain is usually thinking of multiple (2 or 3ish) things at once
[07:13:43] <artao> do you not?
[07:14:07] <artao> EVERY test i take puts me in the 150s
[07:14:37] <artao> since i was a kid (and figured out how to hack my test results)
[07:14:48] <artao> i mean ....... FUCK MAN
[07:14:58] <artao> i'm "genius" level
[07:15:05] <artao> on the higher end
[07:15:10] <artao> hmm
[07:15:12] <daementor> mid
[07:15:18] <artao> are the tests wrong?
[07:15:36] <artao> am i insane? (SHUT UP)
[07:15:43] <artao> daementor eh?
[07:16:01] <artao> consider over 180 ridiculous
[07:16:12] <daementor> its not
[07:16:13] <artao> norm is 120 or under
[07:16:28] <daementor> norm is around 100
[07:16:29] <artao> plz elaborate
[07:16:40] <daementor> mqaybe closer to 80
[07:16:44] <artao> no way
[07:16:51] <daementor> yes way
[07:16:53] <artao> the general public is WAY above thaty
[07:16:55] <daementor> people are dumb
[07:17:05] <artao> you got verifiable statistics?
[07:17:12] <daementor> do you
[07:17:14] <artao> people are TOTALLY dumb. i agree
[07:17:19] <artao> BUT
[07:17:33] <artao> IQ doesn't measure "smart vs dumb"
[07:17:48] <artao> it measures ability for abstract thought and logic
[07:18:04] <daementor> the ability to adapt
[07:18:05] <artao> "smart" and "dumb" don't really even have a definition
[07:18:30] <artao> any GOOD IQ test is going to be largely pattern and shape based
[07:19:14] <artao> the lowest i've ever had on an iq test (avg of several internet ones) was around 135 while DRUNK ASS FUCK
[07:19:29] <artao> so even DRUNK i'm "smarter" than most people

[07:40:46] <Panther> Pure sodium metal, right into the esophageal opening, 1mm above the epiglottis.

[07:42:50] <efex> I am quite serious, a whole lot of people came out of the cooste about beoing bipolar when my family disaster happened
[07:42:53] <Panther> As anyone on the Hindenburg can tell you.

[07:43:17] <artao> i refused drugs back in the day cuz they were all fucky

[07:43:27] <artao> lithium works. yes
[07:43:37] <Panther> Theyt could have if they hadn't burned to death in the hydrogen explosion.
[07:43:46] <artao> but CONSTANT blood tests, cuz lithium is also a poison

[07:53:18] <artao> 1400 to 1500

[07:55:32] <Panther> I don't have any time at which it is required for me to be asleep.
[07:55:44] * artao watches Panther strip off all his clothes then quickly put them all back on when he realizez his aunt ISN'T watching him

[07:56:34] <artao> murthy you don't understand bipolar
[07:56:41] <artao> there IS NO SCHEDULE
[07:56:55] <artao> that's the thing most people can't understand
[07:57:08] <murthy> Panther: didn't you go to the sleep clinic recently to fix your sleep timings?
[07:57:11] <artao> XERO "schedule"
[07:57:20] <artao> wtf even IS a schedule
[07:57:22] <Panther> It's a good thing you are not quadrupolar... the electromagnetic solution for the quadrupoles is very tedious.
[07:57:29] <artao> GETTHIS okay
[07:57:37] <artao> Earth has a 24 hr day
[07:57:39] <murthy> artao: don't try to fool me mister

[07:57:55] <Panther> murthy, no, I got my doctor to give me a magic pill.
[07:57:56] <artao> YOU are on a 32 hr day. or maybe 18 hr day
[07:57:57] <murthy> artao: morlog is bipolar and I know he sleeps in time
[07:58:05] <artao> maybe even 72 hr day
[07:58:12] <artao> LEGIT
[07:58:30] <artao> and  THEN!! Sometimes I just have to sleep for a day or two
[07:58:36] <artao> 100% legit
[07:58:44] <Panther> When I take this pill, all I have to do is to to bed and read, and then I am asleep. :)
[07:58:48] <artao> i'm not "lazy" or some shit
[07:59:01] <murthy> artao: I know all about the freerunning 25hr cirdadian rhythm crap. don't give me that crap. now go to bed
[07:59:09] <artao> sometimes mental energy > physical energy
[07:59:23] <artao> murthy um ... yeaaaahhhh

[07:59:31] <murthy> Panther: thats nice

[07:59:42] <Panther> It is very nice.
[07:59:48] <murthy> Panther: for me reading some maths stuff, makes me sleepy instantly
[07:59:54] <artao> nope. NOT that
[08:00:03] <artao> for me it varies
[08:00:10] <Panther> I tested it by taking 18 sleeping pills, and they didn't do anything.
[08:00:25] <artao> sometimes i have 5 hr sleep 7 hr awake cycle
[08:00:41] <artao> sometimes i have a 12 hr sleep 3 hr awake cycle
[08:00:46] <murthy> artao: Either go to bed now or I am not giving you money for your icecream tomorrow

[08:02:09] <murthy> artao: I was just kidding
[08:02:17] <artao> i have no idea when i might wake up
[08:02:27] <artao> and i have no idea when i migh go to bed
[08:02:29] <murthy> artao: the truth is I am here just for the music and I care for nothing
[08:02:30] <artao> MIND YOU
[08:02:50] <Panther> The last show is up
[08:02:51] <artao> WHEN i go  to bed it usually takes an hour or two before i fall asleep
[08:02:57] <murthy> Panther: thanks a lot
[08:03:14] <murthy> I am going to download the shows and listen to them today
[08:03:19] <artao> it's my understanding via therapy that YOU LOT fall asleep in under an hour
[08:03:26] <artao> do you?
[08:03:43] <artao> how long does it take for YOU to fall asleep
[08:03:56] <murthy> artao: only you know about your stuff so only you can take care of you well. So take care of yourself well
[08:04:03] <artao> also, how many times per night do you wake up?
[08:04:20] <artao> murthy i'm CLEARLY asking about YOU, not me
[08:04:27] <artao> it's comparative
[08:04:55] <murthy> artao: I am no expert, I know nothing. I usually ask people about health stuff here
[08:05:12] <artao> prior to therapy, I thought it was normal for people to lie in bed for several hrs before falling asleep
[08:05:27] <artao> how about YOU murthy
[08:05:59] <murthy> artao: I have no problem going to sleep. The only problem is that people don't let me sleep
[08:06:00] <artao> ^ my above description
[08:06:09] <artao> LOL
[08:06:10] <murthy> constant phone calls from work all the time
[08:06:14] <artao> you're lucky t hen
[08:06:19] <murthy> nope
[08:06:41] <murthy> sometimes I feel like I should abscond and get a hotel room and sleep
[08:06:45] <artao> imagine lying in bed for 2 hrs TIRED AS FUCK!! TIRED TO EYE TEARS!
[08:06:56] <artao> BUT not able to fall asleep
[08:07:11] <artao> i used to think that was normal
[08:07:12] <murthy> cause when I switch off my mobile, my boss or the law enforcement sends people to my home to get me to work
[08:07:31] <artao> how long does it take you to "fall asleep" murthy
[08:07:42] <artao> me?
[08:07:45] <murthy> Panther: I have been eating a lot of non veg food recently
[08:07:46] <artao> at least 2 hrs
[08:07:55] <murthy> Panther: Subway is opening early in the morning
[08:08:05] <artao> and that ENTIRE TIME my fucking brain won't shut the fuck up
[08:08:21] <artao> you guys don't "get it"
[08:08:40] <Panther> Nice :)

[08:09:03] <Panther> I am sending the Mayor a rewrite of the SOPs for the School Board.
[08:09:04] <murthy> for the past three days I had big salad with chicken tikka, cheese slices, egg omelette, tandoori mayonnaise, mayonnaise and 
[08:09:12] <artao> i ALWAYX have to double-think everything i do
[08:09:22] <Panther> I watched a few of those videos and they were painful.

[08:14:56] <artao> oh. not much to read back

[08:15:14] <artao> SITUATION:
[08:15:19] <artao> ME: 50 yrs old
[08:15:27] <murthy> Panther: I think Hitler would have committed suicide reading twitter comments 
[08:15:41] <artao> BAR: Live music? ... probably over
[08:15:52] <Panther> Maybe, but he woud have had it shut downa nd trned into propoganda

[08:16:14] <artao> penis sex? don't care
[08:16:17] <artao> SO
[08:16:19] <murthy> Panther: I don't think so. Twitter would have shutdown the nazi party
[08:16:21] <artao> do i go out?
[08:16:28] <artao> THAT is my question
[08:16:34] <murthy> artao: nope
[08:16:54] <murthy> artao: You get some mars chocolate bar and eat that
[08:17:00] <artao> i may have to hit several (well, there's 3 immediatly accessible)
[08:17:19] <artao> mars chocolate is not an available option
[08:17:19] <Panther> Twitter grew... in the beginning it could in no way challenge the party, and would have become part of ots apparatus.
[08:17:27] <artao> nor does it taste like pussy
[08:17:28] <murthy> Panther: I think you and me are in a bit of mental unrest
[08:17:42] <murthy> Panther: and I think the Pandemic is the reason
[08:17:46] <artao> which is, franmkly, my primary concern
[08:17:48] <Panther> i wanna go to thr bar with artao
[08:17:54] <Panther> And taste pussy
[08:18:07] * artao enjoins Panther
[08:18:13] <murthy> Panther: but artao has two pussies right at his house?
[08:18:21] <Panther> That clears mental unrest real faast.
[08:18:26] <artao> if there were a way to video that i would do i Panther
[08:18:34] <artao> I NEED TO GET LAID
[08:18:34] <louipcD> i dont think those are edible

[13:07:32] <artao> and email
[13:08:05] <louipcD> ftp and telnet good and dead by now
[13:08:20] <artao> not dead, but rare
[13:08:49] <louipcD> absolutely no reason to use those now
[13:09:28] <artao> sure  there is
[13:09:33] <artao> obfuscation for one
[13:09:41] <artao> also speed
[13:09:41] <louipcD> ssh/scp/etc are much better and just as convenient
[13:10:13] <louipcD> or maybe more convenient actually
[13:10:23] <artao> but i'm not familiar wit h the level of wht you just said
[13:10:52] <louipcD> matrix tried to supplant IRC but only half succeeded
[13:11:08] <louipcD> there needs to be something better than matrix to finish it off
[13:11:38] <louipcD> email... is gonna be a tough one i guess

[23:29:42] * Panther has some crumble of 'The Hog' 96%
[23:31:15] <hype> sublim20 I just wanted an analog modular synthesizer for beginners.
[23:31:16] <Panther> It says to use care when operating heavy machinery.
[23:31:48] <Panther> So, I guess an automatic grenade launcher is OK.. they are not that heavy.
[23:31:55] <sublim20> don't know what that means.  hope you learn though, and record some tunes
[23:32:22] <Panther> Ut ok

[23:32:58] <Panther> You don't see many NET.RIDEs anymore.
[23:33:28] <sublim20> remember everyone.  stay crunchy.

[23:34:35] <circuitbone> percussion / bass / lead. you can get all sorts of sounds out of it.
[23:35:01] <Panther> how about screams of agony?
[23:36:00] <Panther> I bet I have a VST somewhere I could get that from.
[23:36:04] <sublim20> that was discontinued with the latest updates
[23:36:08] <circuitbone> lots of wobwobwob
[23:36:17] <Panther> Either that, of after going through them all, the scream would come from me.
[23:36:25] <circuitbone> buy a stack of rubber bands and program the dials to be connected.
[23:36:44] <Panther> I have rubber bands that have 350 lbs of force.
[23:36:45] <circuitbone> wobwob bands
[23:37:07] <Panther> They are attaches to the top of the squat cage.
[23:37:46] <Panther> I fall to the floor holding onto them hoping that I can catch myself before I hit.
[23:38:20] <Panther> I bet they would really sting.
[23:38:39] <circuitbone> rubber bands are over the top interconnect modulators

[23:39:47] <Panther> Like if you took a set of bike handlebars, and bent them a little, you could put them in that band, and pull it all the way back, and then let go.
