[01:44:44] <d_bot> <rbjorklin> For working with base/core you might find this useful: https://dev.realworldocaml.org/install.html#utop-setup
[01:45:03] <d_bot> <Mukal> I'm actuallly following that very book
[01:45:27] <d_bot> <Mukal> Although there are some codes that are not working/different in mine
[01:45:31] <d_bot> <Mukal> Which makes me wonder
[01:46:16] <d_bot> <Mukal> One is for **. for me it returns an error. The book says it's for float but for me 2 stars without the dot is for float
[01:46:43] <d_bot> <Mukal> And for snippets that have ```~f:``` it returns an error also
[01:54:39] <d_bot> <rbjorklin> These behave the same for me:
[01:54:39] <d_bot> <rbjorklin> ```ocaml
[01:54:41] <d_bot> <rbjorklin> utop # 2. ** 8.;;
[01:54:42] <d_bot> <rbjorklin> - : float = 256.
[01:54:43] <d_bot> <rbjorklin> >â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
[01:54:45] <d_bot> <rbjorklin> utop # Float.pow 2. 8.;;
[01:54:46] <d_bot> <rbjorklin> - : float = 256.
[01:54:47] <d_bot> <rbjorklin> ```
[01:56:36] <d_bot> <rbjorklin> Do you have an example?
[01:56:43] <d_bot> <Mukal> ```py
[01:56:43] <d_bot> <Mukal> let languages = ["OCaml";"Perl";"C"] ;;
[01:56:44] <d_bot> <Mukal> List.map languages ~f:String.length ;;
[01:56:45] <d_bot> <Mukal> ```
[01:56:50] <d_bot> <Mukal> This one
[01:57:17] <d_bot> <NULL> (Replace "py" with "ocaml" in your code blocks)
[01:57:38] <d_bot> <Mukal> Nice
[01:58:40] <d_bot> <Mukal> Yep but the book says
[01:58:41] <d_bot> <Mukal> ```ocaml
[01:58:42] <d_bot> <Mukal> 2. **. 8.;;
[01:58:44] <d_bot> <Mukal> ```
[01:58:45] <d_bot> <Mukal> Well, maybe it's one of those "it works on my machine". But not that important either (maybe?)
[01:59:04] <d_bot> <NULL> Did you open `Base` ?
[01:59:06] <d_bot> <hcarty> @Klei023 I think the instructions assume you've done `open Base;;` to bring this all into scope
[01:59:12] *** Quits: Anarchos (~Anarchos@88.168.112.216) (Quit: Vision[]: i've been blurred!)
[01:59:13] <d_bot> <Mukal> I did
[01:59:23] <d_bot> <Mukal> Let me check it once more to reaffirm
[02:00:12] <d_bot> <NULL> Your errors pretty much align with the default behaviour (i.e. not opening Base)
[02:00:13] <d_bot> <Mukal> ....
[02:00:16] <d_bot> <Mukal> It works now
[02:00:34] <d_bot> <Mukal> I pity those IT support folks
[02:00:47] <d_bot> <Mukal> Sorry guys
[02:01:58] <d_bot> <rbjorklin> You can put `open Base` in `~/.ocamlinit` just after `require "base"` to have it be automatic every time you open up `utop`
[02:02:15] <d_bot> <Mukal> Alright will do
[02:02:16] <d_bot> <Mukal> Thanks
[02:03:15] <d_bot> <Mukal> Yep works

[13:54:04] <d_bot> <andreypopp> Curious if anyone uses vim + ocamllsp â€” what do you use (ALE, neovim's LSP, vim-lsp, coc, vim-lsc) and what about support for non standard LSP features like destruct and switch between impl and intf?

[14:17:45] <d_bot> <andreypopp> does it support non standard features?
[14:19:27] <d_bot> <undu> Switching doesn't work for ocamllsp 1.4.0
[14:19:44] <d_bot> <undu> I'm restricted to ocaml 4.10, not sure about the latest version
[14:20:12] <d_bot> <undu> I don't know what destruct is
[14:20:21] <d_bot> <andreypopp> I see it works in 1.8.x versions. I'm using ALE at the moment and contemplating adding support for ocamllsp specific features to my setup.

[14:23:50] <d_bot> <undu> As a user might be great
[14:24:08] <d_bot> <andreypopp> I actually think ALE is the most polished thing for vim/neovim ever happenned related to linters/LSP/completion...
[14:24:11] <d_bot> <undu> But adding changes to it is not easy
[14:24:36] <d_bot> <andreypopp> ah yeah, that I can agree on...
[14:25:19] <d_bot> <undu> Filetypes are hard coded on it, it needs hacks to change from "ocamlinterface" in the vim world to "ocaml.interface" in the lap world

[20:02:39] <d_bot> <Saroupille> Is it expected that going from OCaml 4.12 to OCaml 4.13.1, some type annotations are required to compile my project? I have an example where without some type annotations, the type checker fails with OCaml 4.13.1 but succeeds in OCaml 4.12.

[20:23:31] <d_bot> <octachron> The order in which `x` and `f` are typed in `x |> f` has been changed, so if you relied on non-principal type disambiguation, you might need to add some new annotations.

[23:56:13] <d_bot> <RegularSpatula> Not sure if this question belongs here or on opam channel, but how to people deal with non-portable cram tests? Eg I use some CLI stuff (eg grep) that doesnâ€™t work on Mac or busybox because they all have different versions of the commands
[23:57:07] <d_bot> <RegularSpatula> In one project I just wrote little Perl scrips rather than use the built in commands, but im wondering if there is a better way
[23:58:27] <d_bot> <RegularSpatula> (Iâ€™m asking because of failing opam ci tests on certain OSes)
