[02:23:32] <khanred> Diablo-D3, why is that?
[02:23:42] <Diablo-D3> they're trying to prevent apps from hijacking the browser maliciously
[02:23:50] <Diablo-D3> its not a closed loop like it on, say, android
[02:24:48] <Diablo-D3> so it has to enforce the change of preference by a human the best that it can
[02:25:07] <khanred> Heh
[02:25:09] <Diablo-D3> what they *want* is an android-esque permissions dialog, and for some fucking reason they never actually make a generic version of the uwp permissions system
[02:25:30] <Diablo-D3> that part misses me off, the UAC dialog is a failure because its generic
[02:25:35] <Diablo-D3> its just a program sudoing itself
[02:25:40] <Diablo-D3> it doesnt tell me *why*

[02:25:57] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: that's not the issue. the issue is they are IGNORING user browser selection
[02:26:11] <Diablo-D3> JakeSays: in what situations though? Ive never seen that occur
[02:26:23] <JakeSays> that's because it's a brand new 'feature'
[02:26:32] <Diablo-D3> http, https, *htm, *html, etc, all go to the browser I selected
[02:26:46] <JakeSays> well, read the article.
[02:27:02] <Diablo-D3> I did, is this a win11 change or an edge change?
[02:27:41] <Diablo-D3> it seems win11, but its unclear because they linked to the win11 changelog
[02:27:53] <Diablo-D3> (yes, thats unclear, edge ships with win11 as a core component)
[02:27:58] <JakeSays> "“Something changed between Windows 11 builds 22483 and 22494..."
[02:28:16] <JakeSays> so it's pretty clear
[02:28:34] <Diablo-D3> "“You can’t change the default protocol association through registry changes, OEM partner customizations, modifications to the Microsoft Edge package, interference with OpenWith.exe, or any other hackish workarounds,” Aleksandersen explains. “Microsoft … just silently ignores the UserChoice registry keys for the protocol in the registry and opens Microsoft Edge instead.”"
[02:28:39] <Diablo-D3> but this makes no sense
[02:28:39] <edcba> but what features open edge by default ?
[02:28:41] <Diablo-D3> *which protocols*
[02:29:02] <Diablo-D3> the win10 settings app sets several file handlers when you select default browser
[02:29:03] <JakeSays> lol well all of them i imagine
[02:29:16] <Diablo-D3> it sounds like they're bitching about one that *isnt* handled by that setting
[02:29:46] <edcba> i can't imagine microsoft tying windows 11 to edge for all protocols
[02:30:08] <edcba> that's insta-monopoly fine
[02:30:43] <JakeSays> well, whatever edge deflector does it can no longer do
[02:31:00] <Diablo-D3> Ive never had to use edge deflector though
[02:31:05] <Diablo-D3> so I dont understand what they're talking about

[02:40:55] <bomb> it's not racist nor sexist to hate white straight men, because they're privileged.
[02:41:06] <cn-j> I'm making some menus (I have to print them out), and what I did was I placed each menu's items into a separate enum, and instead of doing the Description attribute thing, I have a static class with a static Dictionary for each enum, and I use that to fetch descriptions of enum values in a pseudo-generic method that populates the menus. Is this a good solution?
[02:41:10] *** Joins: exvicesindaco (~exvicio@user/exvicesindaco)
[02:45:07] <cn-j> It seems hacky, but I don't need a complicated method for it, just the dictionary, which is also arguably faster. The issue is not everything is in one place, and if/when I add another item to an enum, I might be more likely to forget to add a corresponding description to the dictionary.

[03:38:26] <JakeSays> i didn't cancel, but they haven't been billing me
[03:38:29] <khanred> and reinstalled it a day or two later
[03:38:33] <JakeSays> lol
[03:38:33] <khanred> that's cool
[03:38:56] <JakeSays> i've saved $250 in fees
[03:40:01] <khanred> I really should not use it every day
[03:40:10] <JakeSays> i dont
[03:40:13] <JakeSays> every other day.
[03:40:21] <khanred> Master of self control I see
[03:40:30] <JakeSays> alternate doordash and dominos
[03:40:36] <khanred> Dominos is trash
[03:40:45] <JakeSays> mmmm it's sooo good
[03:40:46] <khanred> I don't mind cooking, I just hate doing dishes and buying groceries
[03:40:47] <JakeSays> greasy
[03:40:55] <JakeSays> i hate cooking
[03:40:59] <JakeSays> and the other two
[03:41:02] <moose> khanred: instacart or whatever similar in your area
[03:41:04] <moose> it's great
[03:41:05] <brianonymous> ive switched pizza allegiance to pizza slut
[03:41:17] <brianonymous> i fucking love that cheese stuffed crust
[03:41:18] <JakeSays> brianonymous: yeah but you're a ho
[03:41:18] <khanred> moose, Yeah but that still leaves dishes
[03:41:23] <moose> khanred: hire a maid
[03:41:31] <khanred> moose, don't tempt me
[03:41:33] <JakeSays> moose: i love instacart
[03:41:38] <moose> khanred: why haven't you?
[03:41:46] <moose> I had a maid service for a while, it was wonderful
[03:41:52] <khanred> moose, Because I feel like I should have enough motivation to clean my own place
[03:42:00] <khanred> (But I don't)
[03:42:08] <JakeSays> khanred: nah. put that motivation to better use
[03:42:20] <khanred> Well there is no motivation
[03:42:25] <JakeSays> LOL
[03:42:41] <moose> Alright let me offer you an alternative thought here. If you are not generally lacking motivation, but just don't want to do dishes, this is fine and acceptable. The only reason you think otherwise is because of societal pressure.
[03:43:02] <khanred> I am generally lacking motivation lol
[03:43:14] <moose> Then see a psychologist/psychiatrist and get it on track.
[03:43:20] <khanred> I have been
[03:43:22] <khanred> I am medicated
[03:43:25] <moose> Excellent, then.
[03:43:28] <moose> You're on your way.
[03:43:32] <JakeSays> interesting. doordash has dashpass assigned to a bad credit card
[03:43:36] <khanred> I have been medicated for years though
[03:43:54] <moose> Sometimes it takes self-discovery of stuff that motivates you to get out of that feeling.
[03:44:04] <khanred> It comes and goes
[03:44:06] <moose> I felt unmotivated at work for a long time and didn't realize it was because my tasks were boring as fuck.
[03:44:29] <moose> I can do all of these things so easily, but I had to find opportunity and launch my own program to feel challenged. Helped my career out a lot too.
[03:44:36] <JakeSays> interesting. hope they never figure that out
[03:44:42] <khanred> I have just been writing code to automate filling out W4s for like 8 months
[03:44:51] <moose> Not saying it's the same, but maybe try exploring other things if you feel unchallenged.
[03:44:52] <brianonymous> usually if i can force through the first 15mins of a shit task, i can usually keep going on momentum
[03:45:11] <JakeSays> brianonymous: yeah, but that first 15 can be a real bitch
[03:45:21] <moose> brianonymous: I notice this applies to working out too, for people who haven't developed the rhythm.
[03:45:22] <brianonymous> but in that mode, i cant have distraction, cuz ill fuck right off to the distraction
[03:45:39] <khanred> I tend to break down tasks until they become so small that writing down the steps becomes more time consuming than actually doing the thing, and that tends to help a lot
[03:46:07] <moose> khanred: just wondering, are you on an antidepressant or just an ADHD medication?
[03:46:12] <khanred> moose, both
[03:46:34] <moose> Hm, dunno then. Maybe there is some required mentality shift on your end.
[03:47:00] <moose> Not super helpful, I know. But it's tricky to find the thing that will trigger a shift in the direction you desire.
[03:47:09] <khanred> Anti depressants have just made being happy a possibility, but they don't make me happy. I wasn't even capable of being happy before them.
[03:47:31] <moose> One set of words someone told me that helped me back in the day: Just remember that every time you see something about yourself or your situation that you dislike and do nothing about, you are accepting that this is ok and you are settling for it.
[03:48:00] <khanred> It's true
[03:48:06] <khanred> Intrinsic motivation and all that
[03:48:06] <moose> So tell yourself when you are being mediocre in a task, at work, whatever... "I am settling for this. Do I want something better?"
[03:48:34] <khanred> I think I would be more motivated at work if doing a task didn't mean I would then think about it constantly for like 3 days
[03:48:36] <JakeSays> that's especially true when it comes to relationships
[03:48:41] <brianonymous> not that i know jackshit, but its been my experience that you may be lacking a feeling of internal purpose
[03:48:42] <moose> I have no clue why it kind of snapped me out of my old mentality of "Everything is retarded and I can't fix it" but it did.
[03:49:02] <JakeSays> brianonymous: oh man. definitely
[03:49:16] <khanred> Maybe I need jebus
[03:49:20] <moose> khanred: Is there any aspect of your life that you notice you are very motivated in?
[03:49:21] <brianonymous> jebus can sabe
[03:49:32] <khanred> moose, nope
[03:49:44] <moose> Is there any task that you actually love doing? Video games? Masturbating? Literally anything you can retain focus on regularly.
[03:50:02] <moose> Watching TV, surfing youtube, those all count.
[03:50:12] <khanred> Even things you love lose interest with depression and adhd it seems
[03:51:01] <moose> ADHD is hard to deal with, but I see people who are successful often. They usually have tools they've developed to remind themselves constantly about tasks. Schedules, regularity, and fitting in things they like doing are part of that.
[03:51:08] <brianonymous> its a spiral. and purpose kinda is a good path out, imho
[03:51:13] <moose> ^ that
[03:51:18] <khanred> But despite what It may seem I know things will get better and I'm always trying to improve little by little
[03:51:37] <moose> That's a good outlook.
[03:51:39] <khanred> I'm too stubborn to give up
[03:51:54] <moose> Right, which is why you will succeed/
[03:52:13] <brianonymous> khanred: how old are you, so i can be nosey
[03:52:21] <khanred> I've achieved every goal I've ever set in life but I've run out of goals now
[03:52:24] <khanred> brianonymous, 26
[03:52:27] <JakeSays> masturbating?
[03:52:30] * JakeSays coughs
[03:52:33] <moose> Set more goals.
[03:52:37] <JakeSays> never heard of it
[03:52:39] <moose> Aim a lot higher, then.
[03:52:45] <khanred> Hm
[03:52:50] <moose> But don't aim higher because some asshole on IRC said to.
[03:52:54] <khanred> lol
[03:52:56] <moose> Aim higher because you actually want to achieve some shit.
[03:53:04] <khanred> I just need to think of something then
[03:53:09] <moose> And every time you complain about not having something, re-frame it as "What is necessary to get this thing?"
[03:53:26] <moose> Could be a sexy ass wife, could be a sports car, who knows. Whatever you want.
[03:53:39] <moose> Or just "I want to be financially stable in a condo in a city"
[03:53:50] <khanred> I already have way more money than I should
[03:53:56] <moose> That's BS IMO.
[03:54:00] <khanred> and they keep fucking increasing it
[03:54:09] <moose> Think about how much money you have and the shit you don't have, or what you could do with more.
[03:54:59] <brianonymous> start a biz. thatll make you too busy to feel
[03:55:04] <moose> Nobody ever has too much money, or really even enough frankly. You may be comfortable, but have you saved an entire year of expenses, created a diverse investment portfolio, secured your retirement, taken care of your family?
[03:55:35] <khanred> Working on it
[03:55:51] <JakeSays> khanred: you need ECT
[03:55:54] <moose> And brianonymous is on point. If you feel like you need more things to do, invest in a business with a proper plan and do something you're passionate about to get that personal fulfillment check box.
[03:56:09] <khanred> JakeSays, ow
[03:56:14] <JakeSays> it's life changing
[03:56:17] <JakeSays> and painless
[03:56:24] <moose> ECT isn't modern anymore, there's a new tech out there.
[03:56:30] <JakeSays> moose: not true
[03:56:37] <moose> Uh, yes true.
[03:56:39] <khanred> I worry that starting a business will just drain even more life out of me
[03:56:47] <moose> ECT is fine, but there's something even more amazing.
[03:56:58] <moose> Lemme find it..
[03:57:00] <khanred> the power of jebus christ
[03:57:00] <JakeSays> moose: it's not any better
[03:57:01] <brianonymous> khanred: depends on how much you believe in what you are doing
[03:57:18] <moose> JakeSays: wtf are you even talking about
[03:57:19] <khanred> brianonymous, maybe idk
[03:57:23] <moose> JakeSays: Do you even know what I am referring to?
[03:57:27] <JakeSays> moose: you're talking about that trans cranial magnetic thing
[03:57:32] <moose> No.
[03:57:34] <JakeSays> oh
[03:57:34] <moose> That's also dated.
[03:57:39] <khanred> I don't want to be trans
[03:57:40] <JakeSays> ok so enlighten us
[03:57:43] <brianonymous> khanred: some of the best moments in my life were chasing that light at the end of the tunnel
[03:57:44] <moose> I am talking about SAINT actually, that's what it's called.
[03:57:58] <JakeSays> khanred: seriously you should look in to ect.
[03:58:18] *** Quits: zaher (~zaher@46.58.216.222) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:58:19] <moose> It's a magnetic neuromodulation therapy that can actually stimulate specific parts of the brain in real-time. Two treatments have prevent recurrent suicide attempts in people who were hospitalized, it's cured people of MDD for over 2 years so far.
[03:58:25] <khanred> JakeSays, I'll read but I'm skeptical
[03:58:32] <moose> It's painless, outpatient, no anesthesia needed.
[03:58:39] <JakeSays> khanred: i waited twenty years too long

[03:59:05] <moose> Here we go.
[03:59:18] *** Quits: alguien_ (~alguien@user/alguien) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[03:59:44] <JakeSays> moose: "that uses transcranial magnetic stimulation"
[04:00:23] <pazof> yuck.
[04:01:11] <pazof> coder generally just need to sleep correctly :-)
[04:01:13] <moose> JakeSays: Yes technically it's the same TYPE of medical procedure. But equating them is like saying a CT scan and PET scan; both are nuclear medical imaging procedures.
[04:01:33] <moose> It's like saying an entire class of procedure is the same, which isn't the case here.
[04:01:49] <moose> This is a very advanced therapy that has extremely precise pinpointing systems.
[04:01:54] <khanred> I think part of my problem is the fact that I get like 3 minutes of face to face human interaction per week
[04:02:04] <khanred> Actually its probably not that much
[04:02:12] <moose> It's also a difference between 15% effective and 90% effective. TMS was about 15% effective before this new tech.
[04:02:28] <moose> khanred: Do you drink a lot of coffee?
[04:02:31] <moose> Just wondering. lol
[04:02:38] <khanred> moose, nah I would never get off the toilet
[04:02:57] <JakeSays> khanred: three minutes is too much in my book. lol
[04:03:23] <moose> Apparently there's a whole thing about how the acetylcholine balance between other neurotransmitters can get out of whack if you have a lot of stimulation.
[04:03:24] <khanred> WFH these past two years has kind of taught me I slightly like people in short bursts
[04:03:26] <moose> Maybe it applies to ADHD medication too.
[04:04:08] <JakeSays> khanred: yeah that's the problem - there's no such thing as short bursts
[04:04:22] <khanred> In my experience there definitely is
[04:04:41] <khanred> If you just bore the fuck out of people they just leave you alone
[04:05:12] <brianonymous> you dont seem like the boring type in the textual form, so i assume social anxiety?
[04:05:44] <khanred> brianonymous, oh yes
[04:06:04] <pazof> you're just as sane as possible
[04:06:26] <pazof> socity is anxiogen
[04:06:27] <khanred> I feel like I'm far less socially anxious now, but I still struggle to make small talk
[04:06:41] <brianonymous> beer helps me there :D
[04:06:48] <khanred> Well
[04:06:50] <khanred> Same but
[04:06:55] <brianonymous> yeah, i get it
[04:06:58] <khanred> lol
[04:09:13] <khanred> I've been considering taking improve classes just to overcome some of that
[04:09:25] <khanred> It's terrifying but that's the point I guess
[04:10:49] <brianonymous> ive been told im ass-burgers, it took me a lot of practice... some people i am just fine with, its odd. but i rely very heavy on visual cues.. but occasionally ill come across a type of personality that i just cant seem to... people with.. hard to explain
[04:10:56] <brianonymous> but practice was/is good
[04:11:12] <khanred> I thought I was autistic for a while but idk
[04:11:30] <khanred> I can pretty easily pick up on expressions and shit
[04:11:39] <brianonymous> ya
[04:11:53] <brianonymous> dry sarcasm is my fucking kryptonite
[04:12:04] <khanred> lol
[04:12:16] <brianonymous> unless i know thats just what that particular person is about
[04:12:44] <khanred> There are certain subtle hints I don't seem to pick up though
[04:12:47] <brianonymous> but your improve idea is not a bad one, is my point
[04:12:58] <khanred> Like I finally had to tell me coworker just to tell me to leave his office when he wanted me to leave
[04:13:15] <xb0o2> brianonymous: if you don't ship dry sarcasm you'd hate me. And everyone I know.
[04:13:52] <xb0o2> It's my lifeblood.
[04:13:58] <brianonymous> xb0o2: its not that i dont, its just in social interactions with strangers, like at a party or something, i dont process it right and my brain shuts down.
[04:14:14] <brianonymous> if i know the person and its come to be expected, no issue
[04:14:18] <khanred> hmm
[04:14:24] <xb0o2> Ah, yeah, it's not the most obvious thing in strangers to be honest.
[04:14:44] <xb0o2> I'm often reminded by people that know me that people that don't know me don't actually know I'm being sarcastic.
[04:14:45] <brianonymous> my new people script throws an exception
[04:14:48] <xb0o2> Dry like the sahara.
[04:15:26] *** jinsun___ is now known as jinsun
[04:15:37] <khanred> I also have to think about what I'm going to say a lot what I'm about to say when talking to normal people because I tend to swear horribly and say absurd things constantly
[04:15:39] <brianonymous> yeah, see i would not know how to act if you dried me when i met you
[04:16:43] <xb0o2> khanred: are you young? It may just be me but I stopped caring a long time ago.
[04:16:52] <khanred> xb0o2, I'm 26
[04:16:54] <brianonymous> lol, yeah, age helps a lot, tbh
[04:17:03] <xb0o2> Yeah, maybe you're not quite there yet.
[04:17:26] <khanred> as long as my mouth doesn't get me fired
[04:18:03] <xb0o2> Obviously different people, different ages, different circumstances but I used to care a lot about what people thought of me. Got to around 29 and all of a sudden zero fucks.
[04:18:19] <xb0o2> Almost overnight.
[04:18:27] <brianonymous> that can be a gift
[04:18:37] <khanred> My biggest thing, oddly, is not wanting to offend people
[04:18:43] <khanred> IRC doesn't count, fuck you all
[04:18:48] <brianonymous> NO SIR, FUCK YOU
[04:18:53] * brianonymous bodyslams
[04:19:02] <xb0o2> Well, no, because you're probably a dick if you actually want to offend people.
[04:19:14] <xb0o2> Or a punk from the 70s that's time travelled to the present day.
[04:19:48] <pazof> >>>This are not pixels<<<
[04:19:51] <xb0o2> A lot of the time it's actually out of your control though. People will take offense if they want to.

[04:25:19] <xb0o2> What did you particularly like about it bomb?
[04:25:20] <khanred> Her voice is just so lifeless
[04:25:34] <khanred> It's just like how every female sings in the car
[04:25:48] <bomb> xb0o2 she was punk and she had that angel teenager face
[04:25:50] <brianonymous> thats probably why she has a contract

[04:26:15] <brianonymous> hey, that drummer

[04:26:30] <brianonymous> engaged to a kardashian? travis barker?
[04:26:39] <xb0o2> Presumably that t.A.T.u. song scratched that same itch?
[04:26:51] <bomb> why is travis barker everywhere?
[04:27:04] <bomb> xb0o2 oh yeah those cute Russian lesbians were hard to ignore
[04:27:05] <brianonymous> cuz kardashian?

[04:27:21] <brianonymous> hes engaged to the kourtney model
[04:27:47] <brianonymous> the kim model is divorcing?
[04:27:57] <xb0o2> Shockingly neither of which were lesbians and one of whom is homophobic.
[04:27:58] <bomb> kim model?
[04:28:18] <bomb> xb0o2 yeah, but we did not know that at that time
[04:28:38] <xb0o2> Not even sure it would have made a difference at the time.

[04:32:23] <xb0o2> ... Anastacia?
[04:32:28] <brianonymous> i really wish youtube had a suggested shuffle
[04:32:36] <xb0o2> Who asked for Anastacia?
[04:32:42] <bomb> lol I posted Anastacia song few hours ago
[04:32:46] <bomb> you probably clicked that one XD
[04:33:00] <xb0o2> At least say it was Left Outside Alone
[04:33:26] <bomb> I was surprised when I learned Anastacia wasn't popular in the US at all
[04:33:42] <khanred> I first heard of them when you sent the video earlier
[04:33:54] <xb0o2> Isn't she American?
[04:33:58] <bomb> she is
[04:34:08] <bomb> but she was only popular in non-America
[04:34:10] <khanred> Hm
[04:34:24] <xb0o2> Ah
[04:34:29] <khanred> Associate acts include Celine Dion...maybe I should actually listen to her
[04:34:51] <xb0o2> Who, Celine Dion or Anastacia?
[04:34:55] <khanred> Anastacia
[04:34:59] <bomb> like, chart topping popular, but nobody knows about her over there
[04:35:33] <khanred> Yeah ok idk how she worked with Celine
[04:35:36] <khanred> do not like
[04:35:46] <xb0o2> I don't think Anastacia is the same kind of thing as Celine Dion

[18:17:14] <MizMahem> I've got this if tree to determine which of three items is different, and it hurts me, but yet I don't know any better pattern for this. Anyone got ideas? https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/LfnYOXl5/OneOfTheThingsIsNoTheSame.cs
[18:18:07] *** Joins: AbleBacon (~AbleBacon@user/AbleBacon)
[18:18:31] <canton7> MizMahem, I'm not following the logic. You want to return which of the values is not equal to the other two? What happens if all 3 are the same, or all 3 are different?
[18:19:23] <MizMahem> canton7: mm, if all three are the same, that `setParity` `bool` should reflect it, and I'll continue on testing other members of the set.
[18:19:59] <MizMahem> I guess I didn't consider the case if all three are different, where I would throw but ugh, I'd have to dive back in to test that...
[18:20:24] <canton7> Oh, setParity is a bool? That wasn't clear
[18:21:25] <MizMahem> sorry, my bad. This is code to determine if an item is an outlier of a set, and the `parity` contains a t/f value that encodes which of two states the a value falls into.
[18:22:41] <MizMahem> Since any set that can have an outlier must have a least three members, I do the first three members "by hand" to determine the set "parity" (probably could use a better word, but whatever). After which if I don't have an answer I can loop through the rest and abort early if I find an element that doesn't fit.
[18:23:32] <canton7> MizMahem, like this? https://upaste.de/PEp
[18:24:45] <MizMahem> mmm, close. I'm using the parity value itself to encode the value, so I'm using the value of (one of) the first two to set it if they are equal.
[18:25:42] <MizMahem> I suppose in that last check I would check for inequality of all three members?
[18:25:46] <MizMahem> hmm...
[18:26:04] <MizMahem> well wait, no. True false, so that condition can't exist.
[18:26:38] <MizMahem> anyways, what I have works, it's just ugly.
[18:32:26] <MizMahem> I've been doing these simple problems lately, but challenging myself to try and solve them in the most efficient way possible. Kind of like a reverse code golf, because LINQ makes doing a one liner easy, but a lot of LINQ one-liner solutions are terrible perf wise, so a challenge of a different sort.
[18:32:59] <MizMahem> This is the latest one I did, which is kinda dirty: https://paste.mod.gg/kejlqhyvitts/0
[18:33:10] <MizMahem> but `string.Create` is cool.

[19:37:09] <brianonymous> thinking about going monitor shopping.. would you go 43" 3840x2160, or 49" ultrawide 5120x1440.. im seriously having trouble deciding
[19:38:01] <Suchiman> brianonymous: i personally want a high DPI rather than huge screen
[19:38:11] <brianonymous> so the raw dawg 4k
[19:38:38] <brianonymous> whats interesting is that 43" 4k is only 10" shorter than the ultrawide
[19:38:45] <brianonymous> left to right i mean
[19:38:55] <bomb> don't you have seven ultrawide monitors already?
[19:39:07] <brianonymous> im replacing one
[19:39:10] <Suchiman> brianonymous: the 43" one just comes around to 102 DPI so that's low DPI
[19:39:24] <Suchiman> (anything +/-96 dpi is low DPI)
[19:39:43] <brianonymous> i dont think my eyes in particular would notice it much
[19:39:59] <brianonymous> thats 6 pixels
[19:40:03] <Suchiman> brianonymous: the second screen comes slightly better at 108 DPI
[19:40:19] <brianonymous> so you think the 5120 is better view wise
[19:40:48] <MichaelLong> but only 1440 vertical space?
[19:41:00] <brianonymous> another plus is it would fit my desk better because thats the current config
[19:41:08] <brianonymous> yeah, its the 1440 that bothers me a bit
[19:41:11] <bomb> https://i.imgur.com/KFAB8Ol.jpeg
[19:41:14] <Suchiman> brianonymous: i'd like something with 200+ DPI, like my surface pro 4 has 267 DPI

[19:45:34] <bomb> me wants something like this for my retro music video production: https://imgur.com/gallery/IwfZOta
[19:46:27] <brianonymous> but what would you guys pull the trigger on given the 43" or the ultrawide
[19:48:03] <shadowchaser> I have 40" curved and I like it, more would probably be too much
[19:48:19] <bomb> ultrawide and dual-monitor setups mean neck pain to me
[19:48:31] <shadowchaser> it's 4k, no idea about dpi
[19:49:39] <bomb> I need a Skinner box to force myself to work for hours XD
[19:49:53] <bomb> single 24" gives me that
[19:50:25] <brianonymous> it would be nice having that extra vertical res
[19:50:55] <brianonymous> but it also nukes my current arrangement
[19:51:10] <brianonymous> ultrawide would swap right out
[19:51:14] <bomb> doesn't ultrawide mean you never maximize a window, rather rely on Windows tiling mechanism?
[19:51:45] <brianonymous> i usually just do it by hand, i didnt like the snappy thing
[19:52:30] <bomb> is your focus usually the center of the monitor, or you're usually facing the left/right end?
[19:52:42] <brianonymous> pretty centered
[19:53:03] <brianonymous> slightly left thanks to a macbook on my desk
[19:54:11] <bomb> yeah, sounds like you'll regret if you don't go with an ultrawide
[19:54:38] <brianonymous> but i took measurements and the dif from the 43" is 5" a side.. it wasnt much and may actually gain me more desk space
[19:55:06] <brianonymous> right now, my left and right monitors are hanging over the edge
[19:55:16] <brianonymous> the 43" would allow me to bring it in a bit
[19:55:20] <bomb> who gives shit about desk space when you can have screen space instead
[19:55:27] <brianonymous> true..
[19:55:46] <brianonymous> dammit
[19:57:13] <bomb> aside from that, dual 24" -> single 24" was refreshing for me. I could place the monitor on top of the subwoofer in the middle, and I put the satellites on the sides
[19:58:04] <bomb> but I think I could still do that with a single ultra-wide, by placing the satellites horizontally
[19:58:22] <brianonymous> the standard ultrawides you could for sure

[20:34:22] <Lukky> I honnestly don't know where all those years have gone...
[20:34:43] <JakeSays> Lukky: right down the shitter
[20:34:47] <Lukky> Nasp: I do PLC, but the C# is for EPLAN's API www.eplan.de
[20:35:27] <Lukky> Nowadays I mostly customize/automate EPLAN users' workflows
[20:35:35] <MichaelLong> omg EPLAN
[20:36:43] <JakeSays> Lukky: well you have me beat by a year

[20:41:02] <brianonymous> JakeSays: help me with my monitor propblem. 43" 3840x2160 or 5120x1440 turbo ultrawide. which would you go with
[20:41:34] <JakeSays> brianonymous: the former. vertical resolution == lines of visible code
[20:41:48] <brianonymous> im legit having a hard time with this
[20:41:59] <JakeSays> get both
[20:42:02] <brianonymous> lol
[20:42:22] <pazof> plus one for me
[20:42:28] <JakeSays> vertical resolution is the only stat i'm concerned with
[20:42:40] <brianonymous> but i do love my horizontal res too
[20:42:54] *** Quits: RangerBobVA (~bmaddox@user/rangerbobva) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:42:57] <biberu> so turn the ultra wide sideways if you're into long files
[20:43:44] <JakeSays> that'd be too hard on the neck
[20:44:02] <biberu> shorter files then
[20:44:30] <brianonymous> the ultrawide is a snap in replacement, the 43" would require reshuffling
[20:44:55] *** Joins: RangerBobVA (~bmaddox@user/rangerbobva)
[20:44:56] <JakeSays> brianonymous: why are you replacing?
[20:45:22] <brianonymous> well, my current ultrawide started showing signs of death, and its only 1080
[20:45:40] <brianonymous> and that has been a prob (the 1080)
[20:46:07] <JakeSays> ew yeah dump that bitch
[20:46:08] <Nasp> Anyone using monitors in portrait for coding?
[20:46:46] <brianonymous> i want to go shopping today, but i cant figure out what to do
[20:46:59] <pazof> note: 3840*2160-5120*1440=921600
[20:47:03] <JakeSays> brianonymous: seriously - get both and test drive
[20:47:13] <biberu> code something, shop later
[20:47:28] <JakeSays> brianonymous: or ask your wife to choose
[20:47:36] <brianonymous> oh god no
[20:47:38] <pazof> XD
[20:47:39] <JakeSays> LOL
[20:47:57] <Nasp> brianonymous: Is it one of those super ultra wide
[20:47:59] <Nasp> Or whatever the name is
[20:48:01] <brianonymous> Nasp: yeah
[20:48:04] <JakeSays> you'd end up with 1024x768 and a bunch of new dresses
[20:48:05] <brianonymous> 49"
[20:48:10] <Nasp> Have you tried one before hand?
[20:48:16] <brianonymous> i have a 49" now
[20:48:18] <Nasp> Ohh
[20:48:20] <brianonymous> but not at that res
[20:48:21] <Nasp> Nvm them
[20:48:23] <Nasp> I just find them horrible
[20:48:28] <brianonymous> i <3 it
[20:48:35] <brianonymous> minus the 1080 part
[20:48:38] <Nasp> If windows supported it, sure it would probably be nice
[20:49:33] <brianonymous> thats why im drawn to the ultrawide, cuz i could just *bloop* put it in place
[20:49:41] <brianonymous> but the 43" would be another story
[20:49:57] <JakeSays> brianonymous: well, sounds like the drop in replacement would be your best choice
[20:50:11] <Nasp> You can't maximize stuff right?
[20:50:20] <JakeSays> brianonymous: or get two 43"
[20:50:21] <brianonymous> i mean i could, and i run VS near max
[20:50:23] <Nasp> And you need powertoys to make it slightly usable
[20:50:45] <brianonymous> 2 43"s puts the seam in a weird spot
[20:50:51] <brianonymous> thought about it
[20:51:08] <JakeSays> yeah. seams are a bitch
[20:51:31] <Nasp> 2 x 432?
[20:51:34] <Nasp> "
[20:51:38] <brianonymous> yeah
[20:51:43] <Nasp> I know someone who has 4 x 49" at his workplace
[20:52:00] <brianonymous> the thing about the 43" is that its taking the 49" and chopping 5" from both ends
[20:52:06] <brianonymous> and that might be desirable
[20:52:24] <Nasp> I tried the 49", it would be great if i could divide it into a 27" center monitor, with two sides
[20:52:39] <Nasp> Or something like it, although that was finally added to powertoys
[20:52:50] <brianonymous> Nasp: my samsung came with software that can do that
[20:52:54] <brianonymous> i didnt like it tho
[20:53:42] <biberu> he needs 3 smaller screens in portrait mode then?
[20:53:51] <brianonymous> hm
[20:54:00] <brianonymous> havent thought about that approach
[20:54:03] <brianonymous> id need more vidya cards
[20:54:46] <biberu> i actually prefer 3 smaller screens, no seams in the middle of the view and easy to manage the layout
[20:54:50] <JakeSays> get three monitors made in the same batch, remove the bezels, and mount them edge to edge
[20:55:01] <brianonymous> no thx
[20:55:24] <Nasp> brianonymous:  Yeah except that software didnt work last i tried it
[20:55:26] <Nasp> Most of it doesn't
[20:55:32] <JakeSays> biberu: yeah i went from three smaller to two larger and often regret it

[20:55:35] <Nasp> I think powertoys the only one the kinda works
[20:55:44] <Nasp> But it's still a problem when you maximize
[20:55:57] <Nasp> JakeSays:  3 of what size to what size now?
[20:56:08] <JakeSays> Nasp: 19" -> 27"
[20:56:36] <brianonymous> 19"? what are these, monitors for ANTS?
[20:56:40] <Nasp> JakeSays: AHh
[20:56:47] <Nasp> I have one 27" and 2 25"
[20:56:52] <JakeSays> brianonymous: lol they are free, bitch
[20:56:54] <Nasp> But i find the side monitors a bit hard to use sometimes
[20:56:59] <brianonymous> at this point, 19" is a phone
[20:57:06] <Nasp> I kinda want 4:3 monitors back :D
[20:57:13] <JakeSays> and that was 10 years ago:p
[20:57:25] <Nasp> Or something that would fix in portrait mode
[20:57:55] <brianonymous> 3 smaller monitors in portrait might be an interesting path
[20:58:36] <Nasp> I was thinking one large center monitor
[20:58:40] <Nasp> With two in portrait on it's side
[20:58:46] <Nasp> +s
[20:59:58] <JakeSays> damn. slept for 11 hours last night and can't wake up
