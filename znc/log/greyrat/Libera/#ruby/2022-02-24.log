[03:03:24] <RedNifre> Hello! A friend of mine, who is not a programmer, would like to program some tiny things. So far, he has only done some medium complex thing in Excel Visual Basic. Is there a simple small ruby book for absolute programming beginners you could recommend?
[03:04:07] <RedNifre> The plan is that I'll visit him, we'll do some Raspberry Pi programming to make some colored LEDs light up on specific dates and I would give him the book as a gift, maybe.
[03:06:05] <weaksauce> RedNifre maybe why's book?
[03:06:41] <weaksauce> https://poignant.guide
[03:09:21] <apotheon> There's also Chris Pine's book (no, not the actor).
[03:10:11] <apotheon> RedNifre: The best book I know for learning basic Ruby is Eloquent Ruby, but I'm not sure whether your friend needs a more-beginner book than that.
[03:11:21] <RedNifre> I'm looking for the most beginner friendly book possible.
[03:12:12] <RedNifre> He's smart, but he prefers writing while loops that manually increment a variable at the end to for loops, because the for construct is so abstract and obfuscates what's going on.
[03:12:38] <apotheon> Chris Pine's Learn To Program or why's Poignant Guide To Ruby, then.

[14:34:27] <RedNifre> Yeah, I think it's the balance between having the knowledge in the code vs in your head. You don't need to understand for loops, if you have them spelled out as while loops in the code.

[20:00:25] <mooff> there's a zen to writing hooks like on(:join) { say "hey #{$nick} :)" if $chan == '#coolchan' }
[20:04:01] <mooff> it's more approachable for people new to Ruby poking a weird bot over IRC
[20:04:29] <mooff> and looks a bit like mIRC script, to boot

[20:18:22] <adam12> mooff: Where's $chan coming from?
[20:18:30] <adam12> Is it actually a global?
[20:23:43] *** Joins: bluedust (~bluedust@103.161.144.107)
[20:24:47] <mooff> it really is a global. atm it's set by an early hook along with $msg, $args, $tags, etc
[20:25:28] <mooff> but of course only one bot has the 'luxury' of using globals that way

[20:38:41] <adam12> mooff: Interesting.
