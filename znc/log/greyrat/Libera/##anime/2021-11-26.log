[00:00:44] <Sapphirus> You'd have to be quite diluted to think what China is doing has a benevolent intent.
[00:00:48] <HeTo> emmeka: also, if some authoritarian leader enters a country into an agreement that harms the country but benefits the leader I wouldn't promote that as something the country entered willingly

[00:01:28] <MootPoot> the difference is simple - US interaction largely comes at the barrel of a gun, and chinese largely comes with briefcases of cash
[00:01:29] <Satin> China is *definitely* interested in exporting its politics in either case
[00:01:29] <MootPoot> thats it
[00:01:32] <emmeka> HeTo eh, false. the PRC has had plenty of opportunities to directly militarily intervene in neighbouring countries, in fact it has done so in the past, but never did it end up just running the show there. Look at Cambodia.
[00:01:56] <emmeka> Satin I disagree. China's notion is that its politics are uniquely Chinese. 
[00:02:11] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, I present to you my counterpoint to that ^^^
[00:02:11] <MootPoot> there are some degree of exceptions in both cases though
[00:02:47] <emmeka> it's shown complete indifference to the politics of other countries, choosing to work with a variety of political systems and often actively opposing socialist countries, based purely on whether they will agree to trade the Chinese way
[00:02:49] <isekaijin> emmeka: With mixed success. They managed to halt the US and the United Nations in the Korean War, but their later intervention in Vietnam was, uh, much less successful.
[00:03:21] <emmeka> isekaijin sure, but I used Cambodia as an example because the Chinese-backed forces did win there.
[00:03:35] <emmeka> did the PRC turn Cambodia into a satellite state? no.
[00:03:46] <isekaijin> Still, I think there is merit to the argument that they do not care too much about influencing other people's cultures.
[00:03:50] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: ?\
[00:04:00] <isekaijin> At best they want to alter how they are perceived, and they are not even successful at that.
[00:04:38] <Satin> isekaijin: it's not about "cultures" particularly, it's about political systems which has a top-down influence on many things
[00:05:07] <isekaijin> Satin: There is not much evidence of them wanting to export their political system either.
[00:05:15] <Satin> isekaijin: you don't need to care or pretend to care about moral issues, there's plenty of things you want other countries to do once you reach a certain scale, certain ideals

[00:10:59] <Sapphirus> This isn't even the first example of it, so I don't disbelieve it.

[00:11:17] <Sapphirus> Ports they've captured through debt defaults in poor African nations are another great example.
[00:11:20] <isekaijin> Sapphirus: The thing with Pakistan is mostly that China, India and Pakistan have competing claims around their triple border, and China and Pakistan regard each other as allies in this particular issue.
[00:11:24] <ButterNoodle> emmeka: he reads american news.. they are infallible
[00:11:47] <Satin> emmeka:  i see your point anyways, but unlike you, and years of reading about china and pakistan and india shit
[00:12:02] <isekaijin> These disputes can be traced back to the time when the British owned India.
[00:12:04] <Satin> i don't have any shared notion about china specifically keeping their politics local
[00:12:23] <emmeka> Satin if you want some actual reading on this, look into Xi Jinping's Thoughts on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era, which is basically a series of speeches he did to party congresses there.
[00:12:26] <ButterNoodle> china.. conquering the world one dog shit cuntry at a time through debtors prisions
[00:12:28] <Satin> the second it turns into a bigger nation state, it will be even more explicit than just nudging countries in their direction
[00:12:31] <emmeka> which is ofc propaganda
[00:12:39] <Sapphirus> Satin, that argument of localised politics really does sound like Chinese propaganda to me.
[00:12:40] <Satin> emmeka: I'm aware of xi's position on this
[00:12:59] <HeTo> emmeka: sounds like you should order a shipload of salt to take with that
[00:13:05] <Sapphirus> Not that I'm accusing emmeka of intentionally spewing Chinese propaganda, but it really does sound like something you'd read in the China Daily or something.
[00:13:22] <Sapphirus> It's such a deflection away from what China is actually doing.
[00:13:22] <ButterNoodle> HeTo: he just needs one grain tho
[00:13:27] <Satin> he said some years ago, i think in '16 or '17 that they wouldn't do that
[00:13:27] <Satin> I don't believe a drop of it xd
[00:13:31] <HeTo> emmeka: democracy is a core socialist value according to that same book, AFAIK
[00:13:34] <emmeka> but it gives you a look into how they frame things, which is that their political system is inherently and exclusively Chinese, and that other countries should be engaged with only to the degree that is necessary to mutual development.
[00:14:05] <Satin> there's also a big difference between the currently emerging china and the soon-to-be-established china

[00:14:29] <Satin> it's a matter of survival, there is no choice, to do things the way they're currently doing

[00:18:12] <Satin> Anyways my final 2 cents: I don't think emmeka's wrong that *at least for now* they're currently not actively trying to export their politics much or anything, but there's many signs that they're heading that way for me anyways.

[00:21:33] <Sapphirus> At a certain point the parroting just becomes.. more than just quoting for argument sake.
[00:21:39] <HeTo> it's not even how they view themselves. it's propaganda of what they want others (including their subjects) to think of themselves
[00:21:51] <Satin> Well, for context I know emmeka for longer and I often agree, at least in intentions, on plenty of other things.
[00:21:58] <Satin> than you I'm guessing*
[00:22:02] <Sapphirus> yeah
[00:22:09] <HeTo> there's very little that can be gained from reading that

[00:23:01] <Sapphirus> Obviously if you aren't reading it and just believing it.
[00:23:05] <emmeka> HeTo well, I think there's a lot to be gained from that, similar to how you can glean a lot about American politics from the narrative/mythology around the founding fathers, the constitution, etc
[00:23:07] <Satin> be it conservatives, or liberals, or whatever else
[00:23:17] <HeTo> Satin: I think it's a waste of time. empty words, time you'd be better off spending otherwise
[00:23:40] <Satin> HeTo: It depends on what you're looking for, what your goals are?
[00:23:50] <Satin> it's the same with plenty of things, even the bible
[00:23:58] <HeTo> I mean, at least if you were to read the whole Xi Jinping's Thoughts on Socialism With Chinese Characteristics For A New Era or whatever it was
[00:24:01] <isekaijin> Satin: No idea how things are working out in Africa or other regions where they get natural resources from, but at least in my region, the Chinese are willing to do business with just about anyone. Like, X and Y hate each others' guts, and the Chinese are willing to trade with both regardless. Western powers are more prone to favoring one side, and then maybe switching sides, but seldom being
[00:24:04] <isekaijin> neutral.
[00:24:05] <Sapphirus> Generally actions are louder than words. Which is why I draw suspicion from direct quotation of Chinese propaganda as well as simultaneously defending it.

[00:25:50] <Satin> Sapphirus: emm doesn't believe in chinese ideals or anything like that, and he's explicitly even made statements in this conversation against it. But he's specifically arguing the idea that China doesn't intervene in other country's foreign affairs or tries to export its politics
[00:25:55] <Satin> unlike the west
[00:26:07] <Sapphirus> Which is a direct quotation of Chinese propaganda.
[00:26:18] <Sapphirus> That argument pretty much is.
[00:26:32] <Sapphirus> China's actions completely contradict those words.
[00:26:39] <Satin> nah, but he was using an example of how the propoganda itself states that they see their politics about it being about themselves
[00:26:46] <Satin> and that's not an irrelevant point to make
[00:27:00] <Satin> how a country views itself, how it justifies itself in its people eyes as a nation state and its ends etc

[00:29:54] <MootPoot> that amazon 15% off is pretty nice
[00:29:59] <emmeka> right. my point in that was just to demonstrate that the Chinese have this notion about their system being something inherent to China, a political system "with Chinese characteristics", rather than as the one true way and gold standard for the world. It wasn't to make an argument that Chinese ideology about their way of doing things is correct or that they're even upholding that.

[05:23:10] <MootPoot> Sadale: most of it is in my cock and balls
[05:23:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, Not just wealth-wise. Also weight-wise :P
[05:23:18] <Sadale> lol pfffffffffft
[05:23:26] <ButterNoodle> yea try not to lose too much dick weight
[05:23:29] <Sadale> Are they made of metal?
[05:23:33] <MootPoot> yes
[05:23:37] <Sadale> haha
[05:23:44] <ButterNoodle> wut
[05:23:52] <MootPoot> I cum gallium
[05:23:53] <ButterNoodle> du u make sparks when they drag the ground?
[05:24:07] <MootPoot> Sadale: you have it easy
[05:24:13] <Sadale> true. Asian
[05:24:19] <MootPoot> not that
[05:24:23] <MootPoot> there is plenty of fat asians
[05:24:25] <MootPoot> here
[05:24:29] <Sadale> weird
[05:24:30] <MootPoot> it dosen't matter that much
[05:24:39] <MootPoot> Sadale: the main thing is that the lifestyle is sedentary
[05:24:45] <ButterNoodle> woah
[05:24:47] <Sadale> Even fat asian are lighter than far American/Canadian tho. In general.
[05:24:48] <MootPoot> you need very little physical movement to do daily things
[05:24:54] <ButterNoodle> I'd plug a chubby asian girl
[05:25:00] <MootPoot> sit in car , sit at desk, etc
[05:25:05] <MootPoot> you guys walk everywhere
[05:25:07] <Sadale> MootPoot, same here. I sit a lot.
[05:25:09] <MootPoot> and public transit
[05:25:12] * ButterNoodle lets loose the mating call of the asian whale
[05:25:14] <Sadale> And I'm still thin xD
[05:25:25] <MootPoot> also your food isen't designed to make you fat
[05:25:27] <MootPoot> lol
[05:25:27] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh right. I use transit. But that's not walking a lot.
[05:25:27] * ButterNoodle readys the spear
[05:25:33] <ButterNoodle> *harpoon
[05:25:38] <MootPoot> Sadale: thats more walking then people do here
[05:25:40] <MootPoot> literally
[05:25:42] <Sadale> And yes we don't have bucket cola nor supersize burger
[05:25:47] <MootPoot> I'm not joking - 
[05:25:55] <Sadale> I see. You guys just drive
[05:26:12] <MootPoot> the pedestrian infrastructure and public transit is a joke
[05:26:43] <MootPoot> so Sadale its entirely possible for a person to live here easily with moving less then 100m a day
[05:26:49] <MootPoot> including his own house
[05:26:56] <Sadale> MootPoot, I see.
[05:27:07] <Sadale> I haven't measured how long I've walked every day
[05:27:17] <MootPoot> I'd had to put things in inconvenient places in purpose just to move more
[05:27:21] <MootPoot> hence all my workbenches
[05:27:24] <MootPoot> in different areas of the house
[05:27:35] <MootPoot> Sadale: your phone dosen't tell you automatically?
[05:28:00] <Sadale> MootPoot, I haven't enabled this kind of creepy tracking disfeature
[05:28:05] <MootPoot> Sadale: let me put it to you this way Sadale  - when I visited taiwan I was walking 12-20km in a day 
[05:28:12] <MootPoot> here its like 300m
[05:28:35] <MootPoot> Sadale: you dont need creepy tracking features :| it just uses the gyroscope
[05:28:39] <MootPoot> thats it
[05:28:42] <Sadale> MootPoot, yeah I've checked. I defo walk more than 100m a day
[05:29:16] <Sadale> MootPoot, Honestly I don't believe that. gyroscope is used for measuring the angle between your device and the floor.
[05:29:27] <MootPoot> no?
[05:29:33] <MootPoot> well
[05:29:42] <MootPoot> I should have said - the entire motion sensor package
[05:29:48] <MootPoot> gyro+acceleraomere
[05:29:49] <Sadale> And if you're talking about accelerometer, it drifts. You can't measure the distance travelled that easily solely using accelerometer. So the solution is to use wifi triangulation or GPS.
[05:30:00] <MootPoot> it dosent measure distance like that
[05:30:08] <Sadale> really?
[05:30:20] <MootPoot> just average footstep length x how many hops up and down it detects from your walking
[05:30:21] <MootPoot> thats it
[05:30:26] <Sadale> ah
[05:30:32] <Sadale> Now that it makes sense
[05:30:41] <MootPoot> there are GPS ones, but those drain insane power
[05:30:54] <MootPoot> so the default ones are just that above
[05:31:00] <Sadale> Makes sense :3
[05:31:18] <MootPoot> if there was a creepy tracking one your phone would need to be charged like 3 times a day
[05:31:22] <MootPoot> constant full blast GPS
[05:31:48] <Sadale> I see :3
[05:32:02] <Sadale> damn. Now that I feel dumb :(
[05:32:14] <Sadale> How come I couldn't figure that out? xD
[05:32:47] <MootPoot> becasue you're so paranoid that you miss the forest for the trees
[05:32:48] <MootPoot> lol
[05:33:24] <MootPoot> I kind of want a GPD pocket 3
[05:33:26] * Sadale cries :'(
[05:33:31] <Sadale> MootPoot, buy me that xD
[05:33:42] <MootPoot> I dont have THAT much money to waste
[05:33:42] <Sadale> Buy this thingie for poor Sadale :3
[05:33:42] <MootPoot> lol
[05:33:48] <MootPoot> its like 1300 USD
[05:33:53] <Sadale> But I'm poor. And I'm your friend! xD
[05:34:05] <MootPoot> I dont even have that much in my  bank account right now
[05:34:06] <MootPoot> lol
[05:34:22] <Sadale> 1300 USD is a lot tho.

[05:34:42] <MootPoot> for the poeple who can use it its VERY useful
[05:34:58] <Sadale> But why? You could as well have used a laptop or a desktop.
[05:35:02] <MootPoot> serial port and KVM control
[05:35:03] <Sadale> Or even a smartphone
[05:35:06] <MootPoot> of external devices
[05:35:17] <MootPoot> your smartphone dosent have a serial port
[05:35:18] <Sadale> serial port? Just get a laptop plus USB-serial module.
[05:35:31] <MootPoot> your laptop dosen't come with a KVM built in
[05:35:32] <Sadale> USB OTG of smartphone may support serial as well.
[05:35:37] <MootPoot> to control external things
[05:35:56] <MootPoot> and your smartphone cant run scientific or logging / server software
[05:36:05] <MootPoot> those are only made for x86
[05:36:11] <Sadale> ah
[05:36:27] <Sadale> But 1300 USD tho
[05:36:29] <MootPoot> if you do it all day its pretty worth it
[05:36:40] <MootPoot> like if you were a guy who maintained servers IRL
[05:36:45] <MootPoot> as his day job
[05:36:48] <Sadale> That's too much. Why not a laptop? It isn't worth the price to me for the compactness.
[05:36:56] <MootPoot> Sadale: .....
[05:36:56] <Sadale> oh if it's company's money tho why not xD
[05:37:03] <MootPoot> its dirt cheap for what it offers
[05:37:18] <MootPoot> similar things are like 4-6k due to how specialized they are
[05:37:35] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: tell this guy
[05:37:39] <Sadale> I mean as a person there's no way that I'm gonna buy that. But if it's for work and if the company pays for that, why not? And corporate operates at a different scale when it comes to money
[05:37:47] <MootPoot> Sadale: you have to get out of your "personal" mindset
[05:37:53] <Sadale> MootPoot, But hey you said that *you* kind of want a GPD Pocket 3
[05:37:54] <MootPoot> when you think of these things
[05:38:01] <Sadale> And you clearly is a person
[05:38:04] <MootPoot> you think like a home user
[05:38:21] * MootPoot pokes Sadale 
[05:38:24] <Sadale> And you don't own any companies afaik. So why'd you expect me to think like a corporate when I'm talking with you?
[05:38:39] <Sadale> Plus this channel isn't a work channel either :/
[05:38:45] <MootPoot> because that's what the product is angled for 
[05:38:56] <MootPoot> with its serial and KVM features
[05:39:00] <Sadale> But why do *you* want to get it anyway? xD
[05:39:05] <MootPoot> because its cute
[05:39:09] <Sadale> pffffffffft
[05:39:11] <Sadale> consumerist
[05:39:16] <MootPoot> and also KVM feature can come in handy

[05:39:34] <MootPoot> it does KVM and hdmi in
[05:39:49] <MootPoot> so you walk up to a headless server, plug it in, and there you go
[05:39:57] <Sadale> hmm
[05:40:13] <MootPoot> or if you're a lab technicion out in the field
[05:40:27] <MootPoot> would you want to carry a full size laptop and extra serial equipment
[05:40:33] <MootPoot> and the battery + solar to power it
[05:40:37] <MootPoot> or just this thing
[05:40:46] <Sadale> ok. It's very useful. But not so useful to you because you aren't gonna break even with this device. :P
[05:40:53] <MootPoot> yes
[05:40:54] <Sadale> So please don't buy it xD
[05:40:58] <MootPoot> I want it because my kokoro

[06:17:38] <Sadale> MootPoot, I don't get people who open like 100+ tabs in a browser.
[06:17:51] <Sadale> Personally I only open like 10ish. Or at most 20ish
[06:18:01] <MootPoot> 100+ is a light workload for me
[06:18:02] <Sadale> And I clear session every time I shutdown my computer

[06:25:13] <MootPoot> and you haven't looked at the rest yet
[06:25:29] <Sadale> I still have the following test cases: Australia, Syria, Chile, Palestine and Israel
[06:25:34] <MootPoot> or if you decide "I want to go look up X different thing instead"
[06:25:54] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'd save the link of that good stuff to a note of whatever project I'm working in. Or I'd bookmark it
[06:26:22] <Sadale> If it's for a project, I'd save it to a note. If it's hentai/porn I'd use bookmark xD
[06:26:52] <Sadale> And usually when a tab has good stuff, there isn't that many link outs to other websites.
[06:28:20] <Sadale> MootPoot, actually I dunno. I just don't have 100+ tabs at a time because I can't manage that many tabs :/
[06:28:43] <Sadale> My Asian brain's too weak for 100+ tabs :(
[06:29:22] <MootPoot> what browser do you use

[06:30:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, firefox
[06:30:18] <MootPoot> hmmm
[06:30:27] <Sadale> It's the lesser evil xD
[06:30:30] <MootPoot> firefox is good but meh on the UI side - I swapped to vivaldi

[06:31:30] <MootPoot> although its not a 'light' browser 
[06:31:38] <Sadale> meh it's just another browser built on chromium
[06:31:43] <Sadale> and it ain't FOSS :/
[06:31:49] <MootPoot> that's every browser
[06:31:50] <MootPoot> lol
[06:32:08] <Sadale> firefox isn't xD
[06:32:13] <MootPoot> but the tab handling features are there 
[06:32:19] <Sadale> Anyway the market share of firefox had dropped a lot.
[06:32:32] <MootPoot> better then any other browser out right now
[06:32:43] <Sadale> I see. It spoiled you xD
[06:32:53] <MootPoot> well
[06:33:02] <MootPoot> its more like firefox and chrome couldn't handle me
[06:33:04] <Sadale> nah I'm not gonna go that route. I don't think I want to have 100+ tabs opened at the same time
[06:33:06] <MootPoot> and they kept failing
[06:33:11] <Sadale> and I don't need that many tabs.
[06:33:29] <Sadale> It sounds like that it'd create more trouble to me than the benefit that it could bring.
[06:33:32] <MootPoot> it still has plenty of other features which make it good
[06:33:42] <MootPoot> side panels, tab sharing, tiling
[06:33:49] <MootPoot> inbuilt calender and mail 
[06:33:50] <Sadale> sorry I don't be using it if it isn't full FOSS.
[06:33:56] <Sadale> s/don't/won't/
[06:34:01] <MootPoot> well its F but not OSS
[06:34:12] <Sadale> So my options are either Firefox or Chromium (not Chrome)
[06:34:27] <MootPoot> the team works on it for F but they kept their thing closed source 
[06:34:33] <Sadale> I've got a dedicated email client tho
[06:35:01] <Sadale> calender may be a nice-to-have tho. I've never been able to figure out how to get it work on Thunderbird properly.
[06:35:42] <Sadale> I ended up using a phone app for reminding me to do shit. :/
[06:36:08] <MootPoot> tab sync - you can just push tabs to and from your other devices

[06:38:57] <Sadale> haha
[06:39:03] <Sadale> you caught me xD
[06:39:27] <Sadale> Anyway my new phone is mainly for taking video of my products.
[06:40:03] <Sadale> That's the primary purpose. However, I do agree that it's an overkill to purchase a phone just for that. So I may as well want to repurpose it for something else later on.

[06:43:09] <MootPoot> yes, its slowly becoming more responsive
[06:43:10] <MootPoot> slowly
[06:43:20] <MootPoot> maybe leave it for another 30min

[06:49:23] <Sadale> I don't like it when I open up youtube just to see all those placeholder video  thumbnails and it takes time to actually show the real video thumbnails and titles :/
[06:49:45] <MootPoot> slow pc problems
[06:49:47] <Sadale> MootPoot, this one has gone too far. Let me show you a better example

[06:56:49] <MootPoot> Sadale: do you have any experience with making chrome extensions by any chance
[06:56:55] <Sadale> MootPoot, nope sorry
[06:57:06] <Sadale> MootPoot, I made script for greasemoney tho
[06:57:26] <MootPoot> I need a script which closes every tab which is bookmarked already
[06:57:34] <MootPoot> can a greasemonkey script do that?
[06:57:45] <MootPoot> every tab in the current window 
[06:58:18] <Sadale> doubt so.
[06:58:31] <Sadale> lol you could make your own extension
[06:58:42] <MootPoot> yeah, I dont think a extenral script like that can hook into the bookmarks system
[06:58:47] <Sadale> or you could pay me $200 and I'll make this extension for you. You consumerist xD
[06:58:47] <MootPoot> Sadale: I was just thinking that actually
[06:58:49] <MootPoot> lol
[06:58:54] <MootPoot> I already have VScode open
[06:59:04] <Sadale> have fun! :3
[06:59:07] <Sadale> I was joking xD
[06:59:23] <Sadale> I wouldn't make a quote that quickly. I literally have no idea on how much work it'd be. xD
[06:59:37] <Sadale> plus I don't think you're willing to pay for that xD
[06:59:52] <MootPoot> tbh
[07:00:06] <MootPoot> I wouldn't mind if it was already created
[07:00:19] <MootPoot> but if I paid for it once I'll have to do the updating and the extending anyway
[07:00:27] <MootPoot> so mught as well figure out how to do it mylsef
[07:02:08] <MootPoot> since I'll probably extend it at some point
[07:02:15] <MootPoot> Sadale: a chrome extension should work on everything right?
[07:02:23] <MootPoot> all the chromium browsers and firefox as well
[07:03:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, not sure about chrome
[07:03:35] <MootPoot> okay, seems like the duplicate detextor extension has sorted through it
[07:03:39] <MootPoot> 1200 tabs is not 760
[07:03:41] <Sadale> I guess so tho
[07:03:42] <MootPoot> now*
[07:03:48] <Sadale> but you have to check
[07:05:20] <MootPoot> I wonder how brutal a 1000+ record 1000+ time string comparison check will be
[07:05:40] <MootPoot> thats 1000000 operations
[07:05:44] <Sadale> Great. DST testing status: Australia down. Now it's Syria, Chile, Palestine and Israel
[07:05:48] <MootPoot> for search
[07:06:24] <Sadale> Shouldn't be that long for a computer. Plus if you're cleaning up tabs, it's only a one-off operation and you can probably tolerate it to run for a few seconds
[07:08:16] <MootPoot> ugh
[07:08:18] <MootPoot> javascript

[08:01:47] <SummerSkies> it's a step up from everything else like it
[08:02:12] <snake> doubt. space engine is more like a universe map / browser
[08:02:20] <snake> its not really a "game"
[08:02:33] <snake> its also not quite a simulation tho it has time and orbits etc
[08:02:41] <SummerSkies> stellarium and celestia probably serve different purpose and have their own edges

[10:48:20] <zoidberg> isekaijin: I don't know. Number theory is quite straight forward while Calculus needs a lot of practice and some skill.
[10:49:10] <zoidberg> I didn't go in depth though. I haven't studied algebraic number theory.
[10:50:25] <zoidberg> Satin: I didn't know there's such a thing as Concrete Mathematics.
[10:50:56] <BillyZane> zoidberg, a long long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, i studied algebraic number theory
[10:51:21] <BillyZane> it was pretty neat tbh

[11:01:37] <zoidberg> yeah, sure Satin, the basics are easy. What one learns at Bachelor level is just basics through
[11:01:41] <zoidberg> though*
[11:02:01] <Satin> zoidberg: if you're referencing real analysis, which is calculus but harder, yeah i get what you mean
[11:02:09] <Satin> but even that's probably not that hard compared to other parts of math
[11:02:13] <isekaijin> BillyZane: Mathematical talent is the ability to come up with the most important ideas behind a proof in a relatively short amount of time. It is okay if the little annoying details take a while to sort out, as long as they are just routine.
[11:02:46] <Satin> isekaijin: whta's your major out of curiosity?
[11:02:59] <zoidberg> probably mathematics
[11:03:00] <isekaijin> Satin: Mathematics, of course.
[11:03:03] <BillyZane> isekaijin, i guess that's true
[11:03:05] <Satin> lolz
[11:03:15] <zoidberg> what else do you expect? lol
[11:03:29] <Satin> idk there's weirdos out there who study these things even without it being their major
[11:03:36] <Satin> especially on irc
[11:03:37] <Satin> it happens
[11:03:54] <zoidberg> FEM is also Calculus right, isekaijin?
[11:04:17] <BillyZane> isekaijin, but when i think talent, i think about innate ability. what you described sounds more like skill. those ideas have to be understood well enough before approaching the proof, unless you're inventing them on the spot
[11:04:23] <isekaijin> FEM as in “finite element methods”? Falls under “numerical analysis”, not too far from calculus, I guess.
[11:04:33] <zoidberg> yeah
[11:04:41] <zoidberg> I see
[11:05:12] <Satin> isekaijin: do you think something like mathematical talent is something that someone is predisposed with or something one can cultivate then?
[11:05:13] <zoidberg> isn't FEM one of the ways to find solutions to non-linear diff. equations?
[11:05:20] <isekaijin> Satin: The latter.
[11:05:28] <Satin> interesting
[11:06:28] <zoidberg> sorry, my memory is bad, I hardly remember anything I studied overa a decade ago
[11:06:32] <isekaijin> Well, you can be predisposed by your parents / environment, and of course not everyone is born literally equally smart... but unless you are a super genius, raw innate talent can only get you so far. (Not math-specific, of course.)
[11:06:58] <zoidberg> Satin: there are geniuses like Gauss and Euler.

[11:09:57] <zoidberg> you can make it with gluten free wheat flour
[11:10:00] <isekaijin> But I guess I could look for an Indian food restaurant online.
[11:10:13] <Satin> isekaijin: look for a grocer if possible near you
[11:10:19] <Satin> they might have a snack section that has it
[11:10:27] <BillyZane> zoidberg, wheat flour without gluten crumbles very easily

[11:46:43] <sentionics> odds are never 100% safe.
[11:47:03] <sentionics> but, I'm pretty loose with my life, so fuck it.
[11:50:23] <Nanobot> Last I looked into it, they said the vaccine had around an 80%-90% effectiveness. And that effectiveness fades over time. If exposure still poses a 10%-20% risk of catching covid bad, that's enough reason for me to continue social distancing and following all the precautions I've been doing the entire pandemic.
[11:51:29] <Nanobot> Speaking of which, I'm due for a booster. I've been putting it off because of work reasons. I'm still in crunch time for this project, and it's gonna suck if the booster makes me sick for a couple of days.
[11:51:47] <sentionics> Nanobot: Ah, true. I need one too. It's been over 6 months.
[11:52:03] <sentionics> well, just over 6 months for me.
[11:52:16] <Nanobot> (That said, I had no symptoms from the first two shots, which is a bit concerning to bit. It would be a relief to have symptoms from the booster.)
[11:52:29] <Nanobot> *concerning to me
[11:52:44] <sentionics> however, in my area, you have to qualify for the booster, I think. Gotta be in the high-risk groups.
[11:53:21] <sentionics> Nanobot: yeah, that is a little concerning. But lots of folks say they have no symptoms.
[11:53:21] <Nanobot> In California, I believe everyone is eligible to get the booster after 6 months from the second dose.
[11:53:35] <sentionics> I'm in Louisiana.
[11:53:43] <Nanobot> No symptoms sounds like my immune system isn't really putting up a fight.
[11:53:50] <sentionics> Not sure what the rules are here, tbh.
[11:54:04] <sentionics> but last time I looked I read something like that.
[11:54:23] <sentionics> Nanobot: yeah, I was sick for a day after my 2nd shot.
[11:54:35] <sentionics> it's a bit concerning.
[11:54:47] <sentionics> (that you had no symptoms)
[11:54:57] <Nanobot> The only symptom I had was the slight weakness in the arm, but I don't think that's related to the immune system.
[11:55:15] <analoq> pretty normal imho
[11:55:29] <Nanobot> My mom had no significant symptoms from the first two shots, but then had a fever for a couple of days from the booster.

[12:14:08] <sentionics> Not that they are inherently bad, but that environments growing up aren't the same for everyone, and some folks just catch it hard. It twists many.
[12:15:16] <sentionics> I don't want to hate others. Crime is bad. But hating the criminal isn't the way. Hatred is self-destructive, imo.

[13:19:17] <Bco1981> for the original feel and nostalgi
[13:19:19] <JesseDesu> Bco1981, strange hobby you have
[13:19:25] <amigojapan> Hey omero 
[13:19:35] <omero> amigojapan-sama :)
[13:19:37] <Bco1981> even found a gpu i want
[13:19:39] <JesseDesu> Bco1981, get a real model M keyboard while your at it
[13:19:50] <Bco1981> diamond viper v330 pci
[13:20:02] <JesseDesu> whoa i remember diamond
[13:20:03] <amigojapan> Jesse that's a pretty common hobby
[13:20:17] <JesseDesu> are you gonna boot windows 95
[13:20:44] <JesseDesu> you need a 40 pound crt screen
[13:20:46] <JesseDesu> 18kg
[13:21:11] <omero> odd frequencies, multiplied/divided by the right factor provide the 'clock' at which the CPU can operate
[13:21:40] <Bco1981> i want a Pentium MMX 233MHz, 64MB SDram, Diamond Viper V330 4MB PCI, and a few 2GB PATA SSD drives. and run windows 3.11.
[13:21:43] <omero> its not a matter of pure math
[13:22:02] <JesseDesu> you gonna collect 90s porn on it
[13:22:19] <Bco1981> i have two 17" CRT Eizo monitors
[13:22:22] <omero> in electronics, thats rarely done, because of ... physics :)
[13:22:28] <JesseDesu> dont forget the 28.8 modem
[13:22:46] <Bco1981> it's gonna get a 100mbit network card
[13:23:14] <JesseDesu> is that fast
[13:23:16] <omero> you want to consider analog(discrete) vs. digital(quantized)
[13:23:20] <JesseDesu> what is usb 1.0 speed
[13:23:26] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: your mean 2400bps modern?
[13:23:32] <Bco1981> JesseDesu: that's 12.5MB/sec
[13:23:50] <Bco1981> the 100mbit network card is 12.5MB/sec
[13:23:56] <JesseDesu> thats still fast
[13:24:00] <JesseDesu> for an internet connection
[13:24:01] <Bco1981> can't remember the usb1.0
[13:24:19] <Bco1981> it's gonna be plenty for this old pc
[13:25:19] <Bco1981> i want this old machine because dosbox-x can only emulate up to the same performance as a pentium 100mhz.
[13:25:36] <Bco1981> on my current Ryzen 5800X
[13:25:44] <JesseDesu> you gonna get blue screen of death
[13:26:22] <amigojapan> Bco1981: can't you run freedos on virtual box?
[13:26:54] <Bco1981> amigojapan: yeah, but you don't have the same gpu chip in virtual box
[13:26:56] <amigojapan> Bco1981: then you can regulate everything
[13:27:09] <amigojapan> True Bco1981

[14:22:20] <zoidberg> People get addicted to this stuff though

[14:26:00] <zoidberg> Obviously amigojapan
[14:26:23] <amigojapan> zoidberg: Dr Google says "Apart from sugar and fats, Nutella is rich in chocolate. Chocolate contains addictive substances; one of these substances is tryptophan. Tryptophan is an amino acid that is a precursor to serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in regulating moods. High serotonin levels produce feelings of elation.
[14:26:36] <zoidberg> We have shit brains that keep wanting this kind of shit everyday.
[14:26:48] <zoidberg> Food, drugs, sex…
[14:26:55] <hans> boobs?
[14:27:14] <zoidberg> Yeah, them too
[14:27:31] <amigojapan> hans: boobs also produce chemicals in the brain
[14:27:40] <amigojapan> It's all chemistry
[14:27:59] <hans> amigojapan, addictive chemicals? 
[14:28:06] <amigojapan> Yeah
[14:28:14] <hans> explains a lot
[14:28:16] <amigojapan> Yes hans 
[14:28:35] <amigojapan> Dopamine probably
[14:28:41] <zoidberg> I see amigojapan. I didn’t know Nutella is like that.
[14:29:28] <amigojapan> zoidberg: remember twistedfaith? He was dangerously addicted to chocolate
[14:30:25] <zoidberg> amigojapan: feeling of elation, isn’t that euphoric?
[14:30:41] <zoidberg> amigojapan: ah yes, I remember him.

[15:49:04] <zoidberg> darkwitch: I like the nichijou version
[15:50:12] <darkwitch> zoidberg, that is probably fine too
[15:51:22] <Satin> ugh
[15:52:44] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: was she imitating?
[15:52:58] <Satin> Cryowolf: uh I think curved montiors are a toss up
[15:53:00] <Satin> just depends on your eyes
[15:53:34] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: no
[15:53:42] <Satin> if i were you i'd not take any risks with that if you're concerned
[15:53:42] <amigojapan> darkwitch: tomako solved that problem. I do all the work
[15:53:46] <Satin> and just get a non-curved one
[15:53:50] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: for me, it does not make much sense with curved at 27".
[15:53:58] <Bco1981> i have a 27" flat right now
[15:54:00] <Cryowolf> why not?
[15:54:09] <darkwitch> amigojapan, that is such a convenient solution
[15:54:25] <Cryowolf> I'm trying to find something at max 250ish euro, at 27", 1080p
[15:54:34] <zoidberg> the problem with monitors is too much brightness
[15:54:36] <Cryowolf> at least 120hz
[15:54:49] <Bco1981> the 34" curved i have at work is nice, and the curve makes more sense to me at that size.
[15:54:53] <zoidberg> stick an led strip or something at the back of monitor Cryowolf 
[15:54:54] <Cryowolf> with strong contrast, good color range, good blacks
[15:54:56] * Satin has a 240hz refresh rate on her laptop
[15:55:09] <zoidberg> and always look in well lit room
[15:55:15] <zoidberg> like Gin sensei says
[15:55:27] <Bco1981> Satin: and the laptop can't push more then 65fps...
[15:55:28] <Cryowolf> Depends on the game
[15:55:38] <Satin> Bco1981: 2060 RTX ryzen 7?
[15:55:40] <HeTo> what’s the point of 27" at 1080p? is your vision bad?
[15:55:41] <Cryowolf> I want to be able to play in the dark, so needs good contrast
[15:55:54] <darkwitch> this doesn't feel right https://www.rolecosplay.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IzUOPuB.gif
[15:55:57] <ImoutoBot> [image/gif] 296kB
[15:56:22] <Cryowolf> HeTo, I like the big size and it's about as big as I can get with 1080p without stretched and weird pixels
[15:56:43] <Cryowolf> but it's also 1440p compatible I think, so once I can upgrade my gpu it should be future proof
[15:56:49] <Bco1981> Satin: even my ryzen 9 5900hs with rtx 3080 can't do 240 fps... so what does it matter. if the pc parts can't reach the display hz.
[15:56:59] <Sadale_> nya~ :3
[15:57:03] *** Sadale_ is now known as Sadale
[15:57:30] <amigojapan> darkwitch: too fast?
[15:57:33] <zoidberg> nya~ Sadale 
[15:57:39] <Satin> Bco1981: hz and fps are two separate things
[15:57:50] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, because it becomes more stable etc and so much nicer to the eyes
[15:58:13] <darkwitch> amigojapan, is that a rabbit?
[15:58:15] <Bco1981> Satin: well, they are very close connected. 240hz is 240 updates in a second... so what does fps mean ?
[15:58:30] <Cryowolf> the curved part bothers me though because it becomes hard to use it for things not in game
[15:58:36] <zoidberg> frames per second
[15:58:50] <Bco1981> hence, 240 updates per second
[15:58:54] <zoidberg> hertz is more like refresh rate
[15:59:23] <zoidberg> fps is the number of frames/screens the monitor will handle
[15:59:28] <Bco1981> no
[15:59:30] <Bco1981> the game
[15:59:34] <Bco1981> hz is the monitor
[15:59:46] <zoidberg> monitor?
[15:59:54] <zoidberg> I didn't get you.
[15:59:59] <Bco1981> display, screen. 
[16:00:21] <zoidberg> but what does it mean though?
[16:00:22] <amigojapan> darkwitch: ah gotcha. Maybe she lost her other teeth as baby teeth
[16:00:46] <Bco1981> zoidberg: that a 240 hz monitor will have 240 updates per second.
[16:00:47] <darkwitch> zoidberg, it's a portal that lets you see into the matrix
[16:00:49] <zoidberg> it is refresh rate afaik
[16:01:04] <amigojapan> Yay the new matrix movie is coming to Japan on December 17
[16:01:06] <Cryowolf> So Im trying for a 27" 1080p, at least 120hz, freesync and such and have it be VA
[16:01:20] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: why va ?
[16:01:27] <Cryowolf> better for gaming
[16:01:36] <Bco1981> but worse colors
[16:01:41] <Cryowolf> higher response rate, less latency, better viewing angle
[16:01:56] <Satin> VA is awful
[16:02:02] <Cryowolf> yeah but Im not watching movies nor am I drawing
[16:02:24] <Cryowolf> so why would I want IPS?
[16:02:31] <Cryowolf> I mean I might want VA on a TV anyway
[16:02:32] <Bco1981> better colors
[16:02:52] <Bco1981> not just in movies
[16:03:06] <Cryowolf> better colors but you sacrifice low latency etc
[16:03:09] <Bco1981> and there are 1ms ips panels
[16:03:18] <Cryowolf> and viewing angles become horrible
[16:03:21] * Bco1981 is looking at one
[16:03:27] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, at 250 euro, 27", 1080p?
[16:03:30] * Satin has an IPS that is 165 hz
[16:03:32] <Bco1981> heh... no
[16:03:37] <Cryowolf> well then
[16:03:37] <zoidberg> Bco1981: so wait, is it 60 updates/refreshes in a second?
[16:03:46] <Bco1981> zoidberg: yes
[16:03:48] <Cryowolf> thats my budget
[16:03:51] <Cryowolf> max 250 euro
[16:03:59] <zoidberg> ah, I see Bco1981 
[16:04:23] <Bco1981> zoidberg: so when companies sell a 480hz monitor... wtf are they thinking...
[16:04:26] <Cryowolf> theres no point in arguing about premium quality IPS screens when I can't afford em

[16:05:15] <Cryowolf> or rather it's more complicated

[16:05:40] <Cryowolf> a monitor delivering 60hz will not translate to your eyes seeing the 60hz
[16:05:42] <zoidberg> I see Bco1981 
[16:05:44] <Satin> i can tell the difference
[16:05:48] <Sadale> damn. I'm sad. It turns out that I actually need more equipment for getting greenscreen to work correctly :(
[16:05:49] <Satin> because i play a rhythm game called osu
[16:05:51] <Cryowolf> since it will be worse quality
[16:05:54] <darkwitch> very complicated and more about the eye than the brain
[16:05:57] <Satin> 60 -> 144hz is very noticable
[16:05:57] <Cryowolf> and more difficult on your eyes
[16:06:02] <Bco1981> Satin: from 90 -> 165 you can tell the difference ?
[16:06:07] <Cryowolf> I can
[16:06:07] <Satin> a bit yeah
[16:06:10] <Satin> very slightly
[16:06:16] <Satin> but there is a difference
[16:06:22] <Satin> 240hz+ idk about that though
[16:06:26] <Cryowolf> I tell a huge difference, but between 120hz and 165hz not so much
[16:06:27] <Bco1981> Satin: yes the 60 -> 144 extremely noticeable
[16:06:28] <Satin> i don't think i'd see a difference
[16:06:34] <Satin> mhm
[16:07:07] <Cryowolf> dunno if 120hz to 240hz would be a huge difference. I dont think it would

[16:08:04] <amigojapan> Lol darkwitch 
[16:08:36] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, sometimes. For me it's that the more hz the less strain on my eyes since the monitor will update everything going on instantly without any lag or change
[16:08:49] <Cryowolf> especially with variables
[16:09:09] <Sadale> Bco1981, I could make use the lighting inside the room somehow tho. It may help eliminating the shadow.

[16:10:53] <Bco1981> oh, didn't check for freesync
[16:10:57] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, is it true hz though?

[16:11:20] <Bco1981> has AMD Freesync
[16:11:25] <Sadale> yeah human can tell between 60Hz and 60Hz+.
[16:11:31] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, comparing 60hz to 120hz or more is very very very noticable to me
[16:11:40] <Sadale> You just have to turn it on and you'll notice that right away.
[16:11:43] <Cryowolf> maybe not during a movie
[16:11:46] <Cryowolf> but during a game
[16:11:56] <Bco1981> the movie is still 23.93 fps = hz
[16:11:58] <Sadale> My phone supports 120Hz. And when I turn on 120Hz mode, I can notice that.

[19:40:24] <Sapphirus> meanwhile I'm using 25" 1440p/2k

[19:40:33] <Sapphirus> 27" FHD seems unimaginable
[19:40:39] <MootPoot> Things like playing video and just desktop use barely require any more resources
[19:40:48] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: it dosent look pretty 
[19:40:52] <MootPoot> I can tell you that much 
[19:41:21] <MootPoot> Although for some boomers I did tech support for they don't even notice
[19:41:30] <Sadale> none of the articles shown on the search result seems to be reliable
[19:41:43] <MootPoot> Sadale: because we don't know 
[19:41:59] <MootPoot> And there is no conclusive meta analysis saying anything 
[19:42:02] <Sadale> I think I'll notice 4K if I get it. But I'm mainly worried about the software support. And gaming performance too.
[19:42:19] <MootPoot> You can just play your games on 1080~
[19:42:26] <MootPoot> Why do people always bring that up
[19:42:27] <Sadale> I could switch to FHD for gaming tho.
[19:42:33] <Sadale> true.
[19:43:03] <Sadale> But you can't solve software support problem with that. Some older programs just don't expect you to have super high resolution screen
[19:43:23] <MootPoot> I have a ryzen apu system which handles 4k just fine 
[19:43:56] <MootPoot> Sadale: just switch them to comptibiliry mode or switch display to 1080p while using them 
[19:44:00] <Sadale> linux
[19:44:13] <MootPoot> It's not like you use those programs all the time as your main one 
[19:44:17] <Sadale> oh so I have to toggle between 1080p and 4K just to run those old programs? Nice.
[19:44:28] <MootPoot> Idk if you do , I don't 
[19:44:37] <MootPoot> But I don't know how Linux handles it 
[19:44:43] <Sadale> nah that's too much hassle. I'm happy with 1080p
[19:44:45] <MootPoot> Ideally it should just scale so 
[19:44:49] <Sapphirus> Software, even Linux's TTY assumes my font needs to be fat because of my screen size.
[19:44:53] <Sapphirus> I don't use any scaling for mine.
[19:45:15] <Sadale> Some older program simply has hard-coded resolution. Like lincity the game
[19:45:18] *** evolvidle is now known as evolv
[19:45:31] <Sapphirus> There's a reason why 1440p is a good middle ground.
[19:45:53] <MootPoot> 1440p is the odd duckling
[19:46:16] <MootPoot> It's not a proper normal video resolution so it's scaling is weird for both 4k and 1080p stuff 
[19:46:36] <Sadale> If you divide into two tho you only get 720p
[19:46:39] <Sapphirus> Scaling works fine with my Switch
[19:46:51] <MootPoot> Works fine is different from ideal 
[19:47:03] <Sapphirus> I'd say it's ideal. I don't notice any issues with it, at all.
[19:47:04] <Poeticode> my eyes not be able to see in 4k but my rod apparently does
[19:47:09] <Poeticode> might not*
[19:47:12] <Sapphirus> Although that may be up to my monitor's scaler.
[19:47:16] <Sadale> But if you're doing video editing or image editing, you can easily fit 1080p image/video onto a 1440p screen.
[19:47:17] <MootPoot> We usually increase/decrease in 4x multiples 
[19:47:33] <MootPoot> 480p*4 = 1080p
[19:47:39] <MootPoot> 1080*4=4k
[19:47:45] <Sapphirus> With scaling, you get no more screen real estate with a 4k monitor <27" vs a 1440p display.
[19:47:45] <Sadale> MootPoot, nope. It's 2x
[19:47:58] <MootPoot> It's 4 times 
[19:48:01] <MootPoot> Not 2
[19:48:03] <MootPoot> Baka
[19:48:04] <Sadale> MootPoot, two axis.
[19:48:07] <MootPoot> Yes
[19:48:12] <MootPoot> So it's 4 times the pixels 
[19:48:15] <Sadale> MootPoot, 4 times the pixel count. 2 times for each axis.
[19:48:25] <MootPoot> I'm counting in pixels 
[19:48:29] <Sadale> oh
[19:48:31] <Sadale> I see.

[19:50:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, nope :(
[19:50:25] <MootPoot> It's smoooooooooth
[19:50:32] <Sadale> MootPoot, I've got a 120Hz display on my phone tho. And yes. I can tell the difference between 120Hz and 60Hz
[19:50:49] <MootPoot> Yeah it's a nice addition
[19:50:50] <Sadale> (ironically I've only got it on my camera phone, which I barely use for now)
[19:52:14] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh. Not sure if I've told you about that. I've tried using cardboard VR with that phone. It's not bad 3

[19:52:56] <Sadale> I mean if I watch porn in this month I'll fail NNN
[19:52:57] <Sapphirus> I've got a 90hz display on my phone and it feels snappy
[19:53:08] <Sadale> nice! :3
[19:53:32] <Sapphirus> still only got 60hz monitors
[19:53:45] <Sapphirus> at least they aren't a bleedingly low resolution
[19:53:46] <Sadale> MootPoot, Just so you know I leaked a bit of cum while I was pooping earlier today. So please believe that I've joined NNN.
[19:53:52] <MootPoot> What 
[19:53:56] <MootPoot> Okay 
[19:53:58] <MootPoot> Lol
[19:54:07] <Sadale> MootPoot, yeah it happens if you don't nut for a while.
[19:54:19] <Sadale> It's the second time I'm leaking while pooping during NNN.
[19:54:38] <Sapphirus> curb your degeneracy
[19:54:59] <MootPoot> Tbh after you hit 100hz or so the gains become pretty unnoticeable to me 
[19:55:25] <MootPoot> When I went to watch dune in cinemas I spend the first 10min going Ugh 23fps
[19:56:17] <Sadale> lol
[19:56:27] <Sadale> Funny how they aren't using 60fps in cinemas
[19:56:51] <ezekielnoob> 24fps feels different than 60
[19:56:59] <ezekielnoob> i like it nmore for cinema
[19:57:05] <ezekielnoob> 60fps seems too revealing
[19:57:11] <ezekielnoob> BUT, maybe im just biased
[19:57:48] <Sapphirus> maybe you are, because anything below 30 fps, especially for action, would make me want to shutter.
[19:58:24] <MootPoot> I heard the reason is that it's much harder on the production team 
[19:58:31] <Sadale> how?
[19:58:34] <ezekielnoob> 2 things
[19:58:37] <Sadale> the shutter speed?
[19:58:38] <ezekielnoob> shutterspeed and framerate
[19:58:54] <MootPoot> Since higher fps= background details are much more noticeable so you'll be able to notice issues in the set 
[19:58:57] <MootPoot> Much easier 
[19:59:05] <Sadale> hmm.
[19:59:06] <MootPoot> During movement and fast scenes 
[19:59:28] <Cryowolf> Italso affects CG negatively
[19:59:36] <ezekielnoob> sometimes i wonder if variable framerate can be a thing
[19:59:40] <Cryowolf> since CG starts to stand out more as being unnatural
[19:59:42] <MootPoot> It already is ezekielnoob 
[19:59:43] <ezekielnoob> wherein it will be 60fps on certain scenes
[19:59:48] <ezekielnoob> and 24 on others
[19:59:52] <Sadale> hmm
[19:59:52] <ezekielnoob> MootPoot i wonder if it works well
[19:59:54] <Sadale> that could be weird.
[19:59:57] <Sapphirus> I'm probably more irritated by bad sound engineering than framerate issues in film or anime.
[20:00:07] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: remember tenant 
[20:00:10] <Sadale> I mean the audience would notice immediately after it switches from 60fps to 24fps
[20:00:10] <MootPoot> LMFAO
[20:00:24] <Sadale> They'd be like "oh! quality drop woes!"
[20:00:26] <MootPoot> The bgm was so loud I couldn't hear most of the dialogue
[20:00:33] <MootPoot> Sadale: depends 
[20:00:37] <Sapphirus> rofl
[20:00:39] <ezekielnoob> most anime is stereo
[20:00:44] <Sapphirus> I will not watch that then.
[20:00:48] <ezekielnoob> they won't really have a dedicated center channel for dialogue
[20:01:00] <MootPoot> If it's not a ready motion scene and just people talking then not really Sadale
[20:01:08] <Sapphirus> you don't need a centre channel.. with proper stereo imaging.
[20:01:16] <ezekielnoob> true
[20:01:23] <ezekielnoob> i currently have only a 2.1 setup
[20:01:30] <ezekielnoob> 2 towers and a sub
[20:01:32] <Sapphirus> Like with my bookshelves, you can hear dialogue coming from the centre as if there were a centre speaker.
[20:01:50] <Sadale> MootPoot, hmm
[20:02:04] <Sadale> ezekielnoob, "only" 2.1
[20:02:05] <Sapphirus> You have to be doing something really wrong to muck stereo imaging up like that for dialogue in a production.
[20:02:20] <MootPoot> wym only 2.1
[20:02:21] <MootPoot> lol
[20:02:28] <MootPoot> 2.1 is the bottom of the barrel
[20:02:30] <ezekielnoob> i plan to add more actually
[20:02:43] <ezekielnoob> im gonna add surround sound soon
[20:02:48] <Sapphirus> I'm fine with 2.1 since I listen to music with these.
[20:02:49] <ezekielnoob> i wanna try movies with surround speakers
[20:03:00] <ezekielnoob> tbh i don't need the subwoofer Sadale
[20:03:08] <ezekielnoob> the towers are plenty enough bass
[20:03:26] <ezekielnoob> if u are gonna get a subwoofer, maybe u can get a booksehelf pair instead of towers
[20:03:29] <Sapphirus> and they are like a few feet from my ears
[20:03:30] <Sadale> Guess what's worse than 2.1?
[20:03:36] <ezekielnoob> 0.1
[20:03:37] <Sadale> That's 2.0 with el cheapo headphone.
[20:03:38] <MootPoot> mono audio

[20:08:51] <Sapphirus> Most irritating thing is the volume compression on anime
[20:09:25] <Sadale> MootPoot, you probably know that. It's just a MIDI keyboard so you need software on the computer side to make sound with the keyboard.

[20:13:21] <MootPoot> my parents paid for literally every laptop I've ever had, except one
[20:13:27] <MootPoot> which I returned because it was shit
[20:13:27] <Jigsy> My Mom bought me a laptop as an 18th birthday present.

[20:13:40] <MootPoot> 4gb of ram is not enough
[20:13:41] <Jigsy> My Dad paid for my previous laptop.
[20:13:45] <Jigsy> The one I'm using now I paid for.
[20:13:50] <MootPoot> if it was like 8 or 10 I would have kept that computer

[20:14:38] <Sadale> MootPoot, Wow. You even have multiple laptops. Your parents are rich
[20:14:46] <Roey> (or, they budget)
[20:14:49] <Jigsy> My old laptop still works, but there's no way to use it anymore.
[20:14:53] <Jigsy> Since the PSU exploded last month.
[20:15:00] <MootPoot> family buys laptop - gives it to me , then I decide I didnt want this one so I either sold it for another one or gave it to another family member
[20:15:07] <Roey> MootPoot: what do you use all your laptops for these days?
[20:15:08] <Sadale> They probably put a quite sizable budget to MootPoot.
[20:15:11] <MootPoot> Sadale: lol when I was like 12 I had 3 laptop

[20:15:13] <MootPoot> at once
[20:15:21] <Sadale> I envy yo
[20:15:25] <MootPoot> although they were all craptops and I wanted just one decent one
[20:15:38] <Jigsy> Yeah, old people don't really get tech.
[20:15:38] <MootPoot> which they refused to buy me
[20:15:43] <Sadale> parallel computation comes to rescue. Combine the power of all three laptops xD
[20:15:49] <MootPoot> instead of just getting budget craptops on a yearly basis
[20:15:52] <Sapphirus> Desktops are becoming rarer, despite the PCMR chanting you see online.
[20:16:05] <Jigsy> I'm not really a big fan of desktop computers.
[20:16:05] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: are they?
[20:16:22] <MootPoot> PC desktop sales went up for the first time ever in a long time recently
[20:16:24] <MootPoot> due to covid
[20:16:25] <Sadale> I wouldn't be surprised if you're talking about market share because people are using smartphone
[20:16:32] <Sapphirus> Well, unless you're gaming or doing something compute intensive, a laptop can do most of what one would need.
[20:16:45] <Sapphirus> Even then, today's laptops are quite capable. 
[20:16:49] <Jigsy> Pretty sure most laptops these days are gaming laptops.
[20:16:56] <Sapphirus> RTX 3050 is about as powerful as a flagship desktop GPU from 6 years ago.
[20:17:01] <Sadale> For serious gaming tho, PC with dedicated graphic card is pretty much the go-to device for that.
[20:17:20] <Jigsy> I only play old games.
[20:17:36] <Jigsy> Or weeb games.
[20:17:37] <Sadale> I think the point of having a desktop is for the ease of upgrade and repairement.
[20:17:42] <Jigsy> Which aren't that CPU intensive.
[20:17:54] <Sadale> Laptop wins when it comes to portability tho
[20:17:57] <MootPoot> more power for less money
[20:18:04] <Sadale> and yes. Gaming laptop exists
[20:18:08] <MootPoot> ew
[20:18:12] <Sapphirus> And not everyone has room for a fully-fledged desktop system.

[20:20:11] <Jigsy> I use arch btw.
[20:20:49] <mixfix41> that question has a shady answer i _think_ if the bootloader allows it you can
[20:20:57] <mixfix41> so short answer yes
[20:21:00] <Sadale> Jigsy, For most of the smartphones, the problem is that Android uses a vendor-supplied kernel. And it often only works on Android. So if you install linux on it, some stuffs will break
[20:21:18] <MootPoot> afaik the fucky thing with ARM is that there is no bootloader/UEFI BIOS thing

[20:28:50] <Sadale> MootPoot, sadly, true.
[20:28:55] <MootPoot> always lackign in something, always behind 
[20:29:04] <Sadale> Pinephone is probably the best you could get.
[20:29:05] <MootPoot> tis the nature of most FOSS projects
[20:29:21] <Sadale> It's a bit behind when it comes to performance. But the pricing is reasonable.
[20:29:53] <Sadale> MootPoot, Just so you wait until I make a better FOSS IoT clock than others. xD
[20:30:10] <MootPoot> I dont really get the point of your IoT clock though
[20:30:22] <MootPoot> just run a RTC server on a existing linux box
[20:30:37] <Sadale> Mostly for privacy-councious users.
[20:30:50] <MootPoot> if it was like that guy who made his own atomic clock I can get it
[20:30:52] <MootPoot> that has a yes
[20:30:54] <MootPoot> use
[20:30:59] <MootPoot> !g ltt atomic clock
[20:30:59] <Sadale> oh it's just a digital clock really. But it can synchronize the time from the internet. That's it.

[20:31:19] <Sadale> And it's toki pona themed. :P
[20:31:32] <Sadale> Anyway the main point is to have fun making it.
[20:31:32] <MootPoot> that's that language again?
[20:31:40] <Sadale> yep. That language that you don't speak xD
[20:31:47] <Sadale> This time it'll have English version tho. so you can read it.
[20:31:52] <MootPoot> you can have fun making babies with your imouto
[20:32:01] <Sadale> lol
[20:32:03] <MootPoot> 15% gacha draw for birth defects
[20:32:06] <Sadale> too much cost
[20:32:08] <MootPoot> lol
[20:32:13] <Sadale> no money
[20:32:31] <Sadale> I think the actual birth defect rate's far lower than 15%
[20:32:36] <Sadale> Maybe like 1%?
[20:32:44] <MootPoot> its exponential from what I know
[20:32:52] <MootPoot> first encounter is usually fine
[20:32:57] <MootPoot> 2nd and 3rd is really bad
[20:32:58] <Sadale> oh nice
[20:33:05] <Sadale> So me and my imouto are safe :3
[20:33:09] <MootPoot> just dont have multi-generational incest

[20:33:17] <MootPoot> Sadale: unless your parents are also related..
[20:33:18] <MootPoot> kik
[20:33:23] <Sadale> nah they probably aren't.
[20:33:31] <MootPoot> its like that doujin
[20:33:42] <MootPoot> the incest one where the sister and brother fuck
[20:33:46] <Sadale> In fact I'm rather confident that they aren't related.
[20:33:47] <MootPoot> the parents catch them 
[20:33:59] <MootPoot> and the parents are like "look they're just like us!"
[20:33:59] <Sadale> :o then what?
[20:34:02] <Sadale> lolololol
[20:34:17] <MootPoot> then they explain the reason why they dont know their family is cuz they're siblings too
[20:34:20] <Sadale> anyway I don't think it's worth the cost of giving birth these days :/
[20:34:21] <MootPoot> and their family exiled them
[20:34:22] <MootPoot> lmaoo
[20:34:30] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol
[20:34:45] <MootPoot> I laughed so hard I lost my erection

[20:36:53] <Sadale> MootPoot, why:
[20:36:56] <Matt|home> i need to watch something funny charming and heartwarming.. i've been dealing with way too much negativity lately
[20:36:59] <Matt|home> waaaaaay too much
[20:37:03] <MootPoot> wth the m1 - they made it possible for a person to mainline ARM for everything 
[20:37:07] <MootPoot> desktop and mobile
[20:37:20] <Sadale> MootPoot, meh
[20:37:26] <Matt|home> and intelligent..
[20:37:30] <MootPoot> Sadale: I have a 60w foldable solar panel - it charges the m1 just fine
[20:37:33] <MootPoot> even if the power is gone
[20:37:39] <MootPoot> I will have the power of computer
[20:37:40] <Sadale> What's so impressive about that. It's just a commercial decision.
[20:37:54] <Sadale> ah. good for you
[20:37:55] <MootPoot> Sadale: because nobody has managed to do it before?
[20:38:10] <MootPoot> because it beats basically most x86 systems in single thread?
[20:38:20] *** Joins: RoadKillGrill (~RoadKillG@cpe-71-74-95-248.insight.res.rr.com)
[20:38:29] <MootPoot> because it does all that while using basically no power?
[20:38:31] <Sadale> ARM's arguably better than x86 in some way tho.
[20:39:12] <Sadale> MootPoot, I thought that you didn't care about power consumption
[20:39:17] <MootPoot> because the m1 has finally given a proper push for other people ( server, desktop, laptop ) markets and OS   makers to care about porting and compiling for ARM
[20:39:26] <Sadale> With all those NAS and atomic pi and shit running in your home.
[20:39:35] <MootPoot> Sadale: on my desktop systems, yes, but this is a portable computer I take outside the house with me camping and travelling
[20:39:44] <MootPoot> so its important then
[20:39:44] <Sadale> hmm.
[20:39:49] <Sadale> I see
[20:39:49] <MootPoot> the cost is not important to me
[20:39:57] <Sadale> lol of course you didn't pay for that
[20:40:02] <MootPoot> lol
[20:40:04] <MootPoot> hehe
[20:40:24] <MootPoot> but I mean the cost of electricity
[20:40:33] <MootPoot> but the availability is still important to me
[20:40:50] <MootPoot> having a laptop that can last basically infinitely outside is a major plus to me
[20:41:02] <Sadale> Actually I have a few problem with Apple stuffs. They're expensive. Difficult to repair. And you can't have a full experience with purchasing others of their product. So if you've got a macbook, you probably want to have an iPhone and apple TV and stuffs.
[20:41:21] <MootPoot> Sadale: you know last time I went camping for 2 weeks I was able to use the M1 literally every day off nothing but solar
[20:41:23] <Sadale> s/with/without/
[20:41:24] <Nanobot> Laplus has more subscribers than Sana. Poor Sana.
[20:41:35] <Sadale> MootPoot, I see. nice.
[20:41:43] <Nanobot> Sana is smol
[20:41:52] <Sadale> MootPoot, I've actually thought about developing this kind of computer. Except that it'd be closer to a calculator than a full-ledge computer.
[20:42:18] <MootPoot> granted I could probably do the same thing with a raspberry pi as well, but as Bco1981 has discovered, its trash as a desktop computer
[20:42:24] <Sadale> MootPoot, and it'd be able to run off very small amount of power. Perhaps a tiny solar panel would do.
[20:42:34] <Sadale> lol
[20:42:43] <MootPoot> maybe the atomic pi would be better
[20:42:46] <Sadale> I mean you could just use a smartphone
[20:42:54] <MootPoot> cmon 
[20:43:06] <MootPoot> smartphone is not a desktop class OS
[20:43:06] <Sadale> GUI is bad. But linux CLI is actually ok.
[20:43:15] <Sadale> true
[20:43:45] <Sadale> There're some app for you to install linux distro right inside your Android. I think it probably relies on chroot or similar.
[20:44:04] <Sadale> AFAIK, CLI woorks well. But GUI lacks hardware acceleration.
[20:44:25] <Sadale> so I'd say it's a half-assed desktop class OS xD
[20:44:51] <Sadale> damn I have to sleep see ya MootPoot

[20:46:09] <MootPoot> I moved countries and I went to go get a sim card with me parents

[23:50:54] <Sxem> humans can go 30 days without food, but almost all of them freak out hard if they miss even 1 day
[23:51:32] <Bco1981> so we can live 30 days on water ?
[23:51:57] <DaPinkOne> after a certain point without food, you are unable to move, but you're still alive for several days
[23:52:23] <DaPinkOne> it takes a while though
[23:53:27] <Sxem> if you call that living
[23:53:47] <Sxem> altho after enough time without food, the body goes into hibernation mode and the hunger pain goes down
[23:53:59] <DaPinkOne> well, it's not a high quality of life, but they're possibly still responsive, and with medical care, they might bounce back
[23:55:18] <DaPinkOne> i'm no doctor, and starvation is a complex process
