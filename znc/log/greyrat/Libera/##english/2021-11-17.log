[02:39:54] <mdogg> "While walking downtown I happened upon some street performers."   Though in that example, "came across" would sound better.  DOes that make sense though?

[02:47:33] <mdogg> Interacting with English speakers is extremely important.  Your writing is great.  Speaking with different people in English is probably what you need to try and do.  And not just anybody, but people who speak English properly at least for the most part.
[02:49:01] <ProfSimm> I'm writing a computer language and trying to have identifiers that don't look like robots or nerds made them
[02:49:06] <ProfSimm> youKnowShitLikeThis
[02:49:29] <ProfSimm> So I'm wondering how to separate words. Space is ideal, but a space has meaning in most languages, I can't do that
[02:50:01] <ProfSimm> Candidates are dash and apostrophe. Maybe rendering it as interpunct (middot)
[02:50:04] <ProfSimm> What do you think
[02:51:14] <GuiToris> ProfSimm, a side question; why would anyone write a new programming language? What's wrong with the existing ones?
[02:52:22] <ProfSimm> GuiToris, it's a very long list if I start :) I just don't know if it's for this channel
[02:53:13] <GuiToris> okay
[02:53:29] <mdogg> I generally separate words with a hyphen and concepts with an underscore.  For example:  "Cover-Letter_Job-Title_Full-Company-Name.odt"

[03:43:14] <mdogg> Actually, you get used to it.  I'll tell you what annoys me - it's when people use spaces in file or directory names for files on the Internet because then the browser has to use %80 to represent it.  It's horrible.  
[03:43:36] <ProfSimm> Well sure
[03:44:04] <mdogg> Actually, if you start using _ you'll find that you get used to it really quickly.
[03:45:02] <mdogg> What I like about the hypen though, is that in a filename like "here-is-my-filename-and-that-is-it.txt" you can use CTRL-left (or right) arrow to move between each word.

[03:48:24] <ProfSimm> mdogg, that's what I used until today. But today I realized I might need a disambiguation when I query an object's methods, and when I query an object's subitems (like a tree of identifiers like in a package)

[03:48:43] <mdogg> Ok.
[03:48:57] <ProfSimm> But maybe I'll pick something else for hierarchy instead
[03:48:58] <mdogg> Well, you could look for the last dot.. but I see what you mean.
[03:49:26] <mdogg> Underscores are farily common in Unix to separate words.
[03:50:21] <ProfSimm> Frankly I was getting used to space as a property accessor, and dot as separator, for example:  std.lib data sql query ("SELECT * FROM whatever") first
[03:50:29] <mdogg> So are hyphens, though.
[03:51:27] <ProfSimm> Maybe I can disambiguate some other way 
[03:52:25] <ProfSimm> ACtually you don't need parens here, but anyway

[19:09:09] <PaulePanter> In this case it’s actually about *two* systemd service units, which can be ordered. I just wanted to make it less computer related.
[19:09:38] <PaulePanter> I would have said: There is no ordering between the two units.
[19:09:47] <PaulePanter> After the feedback I went with *order*.

[19:12:13] <CuriosTiger> "order" has multiple uses. Just because you order food at a restaurant doesn't mean you can't put items in a list in order. Or put your affairs in order. But the verb "to order" does refer to placing an order the vast majority of the time.
[19:14:06] <Me-me> I ordered ordered hors d'oeuvres. These hors d'oeuvres are unordered. I order you to order me my order.
[19:14:33] <Me-me> Oh, dur, you're just an orderly!
[19:14:57] <CuriosTiger> In order to do that, I need to order the font du hors d'ouevres. And that's a tall order.

[21:27:52] <dfcnvt> I'm having a trouble in understanding this "rule" from the "10 Point Commentary" -- I'm going to paste it here.
[21:28:00] <dfcnvt> 4-6 Seconds Following Time for Speeds Under 30 mph, 6-8 Seconds for Speeds
[21:28:00] <dfcnvt> Over 30 mph – This is to keep you from getting a fixation on the car ahead and to allow time to
[21:28:08] <dfcnvt> obtain and hold the proper eye-lead time.
[21:30:24] <huf> context?
[21:30:35] <dfcnvt> Just when do I count internally 4 to 6 seconds whenever I am under 30mph?  By the time I start driving from stop?  Is it that I cannot accelerate the vehicle over 30mph if it's less than 4-6 seconds...?  I must drive under 30mph with a duration of 4-6 seconds?
[21:31:11] <dfcnvt> huf: Sorry, it's the driving test that comes with "10 Point Commentary"...This is rule #4.   (It's for Driver position at Amazon)
[21:31:37] <huf> is that the whole rule?
[21:31:39] <huf> nothing else?
[21:31:53] <Inhahe> i think it means maintain a distance such that it would take you 4-6 seconds to reach the car in front of you

[21:37:13] <dfcnvt> Scroll down for "10 point commentary", down to number 4
[21:37:51] <pussipupu> The time between the car in front of you passing a point and you passing the and point
[21:37:55] <Inhahe> why are we still doing this, i already said what it means =p
[21:38:04] <pussipupu> s/the and/the same/
[21:38:33] <pussipupu> Well technically you said something else, ask Zeno
[21:38:35] <dfcnvt> pussipupu: Oh.........That make sense
[21:38:45] <pussipupu> but also I was scrolled up slightly
[21:38:48] <huf> yeah but in context this seems to be just for starting out
[21:38:54] <huf> and then you're supposed to increase it to 8-12
[21:39:04] *** Quits: Kaylah (~Kaylah@84-198-141-54.access.telenet.be) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[21:40:14] <huf> so i think definitely count to 3 before starting to move but then, depending on the speed of the car ahead, start going when you're 4-6 or 6-8 behind, but then gradually widen that to 8-12?
[21:40:37] <huf> there's no way anyone actually obeys that in crowded cities... :D
[21:40:46] <pussipupu> Those are big gaps though
[21:40:49] <huf> very
[21:41:01] <huf> unless
[21:41:05] <pussipupu> "Only a fool forgets the two second rule"
[21:41:07] <huf> I'm misreading it :D
[21:41:22] <huf> ah. yeah I am
[21:41:35] <huf> the 8-12 is for eye lead time
[21:41:36] <huf> what's that then?
[21:42:29] <Inhahe> dunno, i'd guess the distance between the furthest away you're looking and you?
[21:42:40] <huf> anyway, you were right
[21:42:58] <dfcnvt> Yeah, I don't understand the rule number 5.   "Eye lead time"?
[21:43:08] <huf> probably what Inhahe said just now
[21:43:11] <huf> that seems to make sense
[21:43:51] <dfcnvt> I see, when at the speed limits other than 30mph...that would be 8-12?
[21:44:16] <dfcnvt> Like, driving on a highway
[21:44:20] <huf> no, i think that's for always. where you should look
[21:44:25] <huf> but keep bigger gaps when above 30

[21:48:42] <dfcnvt> Okay, I think I'm good with number 4.  If driving below 30mph then ensure the distance between me and the front of the car is 4-6 seconds gap....Whereas if driving above 30mph, then the distance should be 6 to 8 seconds gap.
[21:51:30] <dfcnvt> Okay, I think Rule number 5 -- is just to tell you where your eyes should be located on the road (only if no vehicle is in front of you of less than 8-12 seconds gap)...It  is to prepare ahead of the time for any incoming obstacle
