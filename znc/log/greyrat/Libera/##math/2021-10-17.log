[00:04:17] <noobly> So how do you 'prove' the closure of the open ball is a subset of the closed ball? It seems obvious to me that the closure set is all points that have distance r from the origin, so the new set is |y-x| <= r, which happens to be the criteria for the closed ball.

[00:09:13] <noobly> Z-module, well in this case my points must only be less than r, so it is true in this case that the closure set is all points that along the perimeter or surface r, right?

[00:10:58] <noobly> yes you're right thanks, I keep getting that mixed up. Well at any rate, the closure set is then just the union of the open set with the boundary points?
[00:11:05] <Z-module> but even if you changed your  = r   to   <= r    that does not give the correct interpretation of "closure". That's sort of the entire point of this exercise.
[00:11:07] <noobly> (in this case at least)
[00:11:59] <Z-module> if by "boundary points" you mean the points at distance exactly r, that's still wrong in general.  It's right in R^n

[00:31:42] <Z-module> you need a union over certain open subsets of X x X , all of which are disjoint from diag(X).  What you just did is only certain open subsets of X.
[00:31:56] <Z-module> REmember your goal is to show that  (X x X)\diag(X)  is open in X x X.
[00:32:10] <cuppajoeman> Right, I realized something was wrong. I'm thinking that I should take V_b x V_b
[00:32:18] <cuppajoeman> And that should be disjoint from U x U
[00:32:28] <cuppajoeman> Because U and V_b were disjoint neighborhoods originally
[00:32:33] <Z-module> and a set is open in X x X  iff it is some union of open rectangles  U x V   (U, V both open in X)
[00:32:58] <cuppajoeman> Right
[00:33:33] <Z-module> right:  A, B disjoint in X   <->   A x B disjoint from diag(X) in X x X
[00:34:38] <Z-module> You don't need to focus on any single (a,a) to begin with
[00:35:08] <Z-module> Just note that  (x,y) in (X x X)\diag(X)   iff    x != y
[00:35:28] <cuppajoeman> so then we get open neighborhoods U, V of x, and y disjoint in X
[00:35:37] <Z-module> right

[00:35:58] <Franciman> now that I am using it for k-differential forms

[04:45:41] <fweht> buster: yeah, the density function of the sum of two independently distributed variables would be the convolution of their individual density functions or something like that?  does that make sense?

[08:11:30] <biberao> theres an "or" on the left and "and" on the right
[08:11:49] <greenbagels> where? they both have ors
[08:11:54] <biberao> ok
[08:11:56] <greenbagels> (a or ~p) and (a or ~r)
[08:12:00] <biberao> i typed wrong

[08:12:51] <biberao> he did this
[08:13:03] <biberao> i was right
[08:13:19] <biberao> but what i meant was

[08:13:48] <damo22> i need to find a matrix product of k multiplications on C(k-j)
[08:13:58] <biberao> how do we distribute it it look so weird
[08:14:36] <biberao> couldnt i do it like this (a-b)(c+d) = ac+ad-bc-bd
[08:14:44] <greenbagels> so you get (p or ~q or ~p) and (p or ~q or ~r)
[08:15:29] <greenbagels> let me insert some parentheses to make it more clear
[08:15:41] <greenbagels> so you get ((p or ~q) or ~p) and ((p or ~q) or ~r)
[08:15:49] <damo22> but the elements are not numbers they are symbols
[08:15:51] <greenbagels> the inner parentheses are around what you called "a" earlier

[08:18:37] <cuppajoeman> If you look at the bottom diagram there are no neighbors on the same side where side refers to the upper section (so in the bottom diagram the upper section (or rather partition) is 001, 010, 100, 111 )

[08:26:16] <greenbagels> Well
[08:26:22] <cuppajoeman> In general it should work
[08:26:45] <biberao> cuppajoeman: what subject is that?
[08:26:45] <greenbagels> a simple way to think about how boolean expressions work is by writing out truth tables for them
[08:26:49] <Stalevar> Three digits natural numbers are divided by the sum of their digits. Can 55 appear as the result? What about 87? What is the smallest possible result of division if the number's first digit is seven?
[08:27:23] <greenbagels> So try it with that expression biberao
[08:27:34] <greenbagels> Only one variable determines the value of the expression; p
[08:28:19] <cuppajoeman> Given two bipartite graphs, if we add new edges (the ones with N in them) directly from one partition to another (not sure how to formally say that, but look at the pic), then we can always twist to form a new bipartite graph @greenbagels
[08:28:30] <biberao> greenbagels: the truth table wont be good to prove it

[11:44:05] <papertowel1> Unrelated to my previous question, I'm learning about field extensions, and I find the definition to be clunky. If we have a field F, and we construct some extension E, the extension usually doesn't contain F, but contains an isomorphic copy of F, let's call it F'. But all the theorems then continue to reference F and polynomials in F[x]. The authors usually say that F will be identified with F'. Why not talk about the
[11:44:05] <papertowel1> actual subfield F' instead of developing subsequent definitions and theorems with resepct to F?

[11:58:29] <greenbagels> papertowel1: F' has the same field structure as F
[11:58:50] <greenbagels> so for all purposes related to studying field structure, F' vs F doesn't matter
[12:02:19] <papertowel1> Maybe it's a matter of getting used to, but I still find it distracting to have to remind myself that F isn't actually F, and that f(x) is different as well. I'm not quite sure what we would lose if we developed the theory of extensions by making the keeping the distinction between F and F', so we would make use of F' instead of F in subsequent definitions and theorems.
[12:03:06] <greenbagels> papertowel1: i dont think its a super important thing to constantly remind yourself

[12:10:48] <papertowel1> I suppose one reason why that distinction might be important is that the field extension doesn't expand F, which is maybe what we wanted. The fact that x^2+1 has no zero in R (real numbers) is important, and it would seem wrong to say that R[x]/<x^2+1> is now an extension where x^2+1 does have a zero, which isn't what we wanted.

[12:34:31] <papertowel1> Let's take R for example. We construct R[x]/<x^2+1>, but x^2+1 in R[x] still doesn't have a zero. There's a copy of R in R[x]/<x^2+1>, let's call it R', and the corresponding polynomial of x^2+1 in R'[x] has a zero. One way to get around this is to say, let's rename R' with R, and all elements in R' will be renamed to their corresponding elements in R. After this renaming we'd have a R in R[x]/<x^2+1> where x^2+1 has a
[12:34:31] <papertowel1> zero. But this renaming idea isn't so rigorous in my mind.

[16:01:15] <vancz> The third example here seems wrong or I'm missing something?: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_root_theorem#Third
[16:02:30] <vancz> They do a replacement x -> 1+t, assuming p(1) != 0, which i presume is intended to be root-preserving, and then applying the rational root theorem results in a changed set and they take the intersection and this is supposed to make it more efficient
[16:02:32] <Z-module> checking
[16:03:21] <vancz> but it would only make sense to me in that: it's root preserving, but also moves the roots (and the whole thing) along the x axis
[16:03:37] <vancz> so it changes the roots
[16:03:50] <niedzejkob[m]> but they do shift the roots back
[16:03:50] <vancz> did that make sense?
[16:04:01] <vancz> oh, let me reread then
[16:04:14] <niedzejkob[m]> like, they get t = +- 1/{1,3}, but then shift that to get x = 2, 0, 4/3, 2/3

[17:11:53] <vancz> yeah thats what i meant to ask basically
[17:12:21] <niedzejkob[m]> doing it with an arbitrary number is certainly sound, not sure if the results are gonna be useful
[17:12:36] <niedzejkob[m]> so, in this case, I'd just try some random examples and see
[17:14:05] <vancz> given that its a root preserving transformation it seems like it shouldnt matter, and otherwise youre just trying to fiddle with it to make the fake root candidates change

[17:15:28] *** Quits: HisShadow (~HisShadow@user/hisshadow) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[17:15:57] <niedzejkob[m]> oh, the thing about shifting by a root candidate is that you already computed P(a) which is the constant term coefficient
[17:16:02] <vancz> some of this still looks kind of funky to me
[17:16:17] <vancz> wait why does shifting preserve the constant term?
[17:16:22] <vancz> huh?
[17:16:36] <vancz> also currently im hung up on:
[17:16:45] <vancz> "Substituting x = 1 + t yields a polynomial in t with constant term P(1) = 1,"
[17:17:14] <niedzejkob[m]> it doesn't, but substituting x := a + t will get you P'(t) = P(a + t), so P'(0) = P(a)
[17:17:21] <niedzejkob[m]> a=1 in the example
[17:17:31] <niedzejkob[m]> and P'(0) is the constant term of the new polynomial
[17:18:02] <vancz> though, ok i guess this is what i was saying earlier about not needing to expand the substitution because the constant and highest degree terms are the only ones that matter, and those expand as if t^3 "+" 1^3
[17:18:08] <vancz> i.e. its the same as if you calculated p(1)
[17:18:26] <niedzejkob[m]> yup
[17:18:48] <niedzejkob[m]> and you already calculate P(1) to check if it's zero
[17:19:20] <vancz> apparently i just dont understand things if someone else is saying them :p
[17:19:54] <niedzejkob[m]> :D
[17:20:10] <vancz> (this is actually a recurring problem...)
[17:20:20] <vancz> (i have to figure out everything myself..)
[17:21:11] <vancz> so, you apply the rational root theorem and start testing candidates, if you get a root youre happy, if you dont, you apply the rational root theorem on the old main coefficient and the "new" constant cofficient and take the intersection of the candidate sets, repeat
[17:21:30] <niedzejkob[m]> yes
[17:21:34] <vancz> and i think you might not even have to backtrack given that all roots should be preserved right?
[17:21:38] <niedzejkob[m]> remember to shift the new candidates back
[17:21:47] <Z-module> vancz, changing x to x + c in p(x) only preserves the constant term if the sum of all the non-constant-term coefficients of p(x) is 0. That sum is exactly p(1) - (the constant term), that is,  p(1) - p(0).

If you expand out all those terms, then all the new constant terms (with the still-present r_0 too) gives the constant term of p(x + c) which is   r_n c^n +...+ r_1 c + r_0.  So this is the same as the original r_0 iff  r_n c^n +...+ r_1 c = 0, in other words  h(c) = 0  where  h(x) =
[17:37:54] <Z-module> p(x) - r_0 = p(x) - p(0).
[17:38:53] <vancz> ok sure but I don't think anyone said anything about the constant term of the new substitution being the same as the old constant term...did I?

[17:39:36] <niedzejkob[m]> <vancz> "wait why does shifting preserve..." <- you asked about that here
[17:39:55] <Z-module> The article can certainly use improvement.
[17:39:59] <cherim> Because people think of this as "<niedzejkob[m]> it doesn't, but substituting x := a + t will get you P'(t) = P(a + t), so P'(0) = P(a)", not as expanding every (x+a)^k binomial

[17:40:59] <vancz> i did say that
[17:41:00] <vancz> wat
[17:42:33] <Z-module> THis whole example and discussion is focusing on applying a test to only the leading coeff. and the constant term (the Rational Root thing), and using a certain change of variable to somewhat simplify that test. Actually, I think it's a much too artificial example, because 4 possible candidate rational roots instead of 8 isn't worth the effort.
[17:42:58] <niedzejkob[m]> it's not 4, you intersect to get just 1 candidate

[20:28:57] <Z-module> |ab| = |a||b|   is true for all comlex a and b anyway.
[20:29:33] <[itchyjunk]> right
[20:30:15] <Z-module> So it's something specific about S that forces it to have only unit-length numbers.
[20:30:20] <[itchyjunk]> S finite so s^n = s^m for some n,m in N, m > n
[20:31:17] <[itchyjunk]> so |s^n| = |s^m| and since 0 not in S, it has to be 1?

[20:35:31] <niedzejkob[m]> you can do simpler: from s^n = s^m for m > n you get s^(m-n) = 1

[22:55:48] <vancz> "ax+by=c is a linear diophantine equation, solvable if gcd(a,b) divides c"
[22:56:08] <vancz> we were given a solution method, thats fine and all,
[22:56:23] <vancz> but it seems to me that theres some geometry to this and it wasnt mentioned and I dont see through it by myself
[22:56:49] <vancz> obivously thats a linear equation in the sense that you can plot a line with normal vector (a,b)
[22:57:30] <vancz> since we are working over integers, obviously the only points that are good are the ones on grid points
[22:57:35] <vancz> but thats as far as i got, now what?
[22:58:57] <vancz> its given that if you have a solution (x0,y0) then (x',y')=(x0,y0) + t/gcd(a,b) * (b, -a) are also solutions
[22:59:21] <vancz> but what does this mean geometrically?

[23:19:38] <preyalone> Is matrix cross product multiplication associative under modular arithmetic? Fuzzing 4x4 matrices with boolean values *seems* to say yes.
