[00:00:27] <PJBoy> ptrdiff_t is hardware implemented?
[00:00:31] <PJBoy> that's incorrect

[00:01:03] <PJBoy> it has some requirements like being unsigned and minimum 16 bits

[00:01:13] <TinoDidriksen> Doesn't matter if you doubt it - size_t is guaranteed unsigned.
[00:01:23] <cq-work> "The type size_­t is an implementation-defined unsigned integer type that is large enough to contain the size in bytes of any object ([expr.sizeof])."
[00:01:29] <Juliu> TinoDidriksen, I doubt that
[00:01:33] <nq> I though size_t was meant to match the register size of the machine
[00:01:37] <nq> and be unsigned
[00:01:39] <TinoDidriksen> You are wrong to doubt that. It's in the Standard.
[00:01:49] <cq-work> Juliu, there's no need to doubt, our bible says so
[00:01:54] <PJBoy> nah, there's nothing that has that property, but `int` is "recommended" to match the register size
[00:01:57] <TinoDidriksen> size_t must be >= 16 bits and unsigned.
[00:01:58] <Juliu> cq-work, I am not religious
[00:02:10] <PJBoy> ptrdiff_t is similar to size_t, but guaranteed to be signed and at least 17 bits
[00:02:29] <Juliu> PJBoy, one more reason to use int and not size_t
[00:02:45] <TinoDidriksen> int is abysmal. Can't rely on it.

[00:07:27] <nq> yes, even gnu relies on some

[00:08:45] <PJBoy> I've used libgmp, it's pretty painful
[00:08:55] <rpav> well, the C api .. most C apis are
[00:08:57] <nq> there's also gnu mpc and mpfr
[00:10:10] <rpav> the next gcc is probably compiled by randomly choosing and executing integers until it finds one which passes the tests, including one where its version is 1 greater than the prior
[00:10:54] <rpav> 91? let's execute that; i never liked it anyway... it should have been prime
[00:11:53] <Juliu> Randomness is a good idea if you don't know better and if consecutively choosing right half of the time leads to success
[00:12:21] <nq> what was that library used for quick random testing
[00:12:22] <Juliu> (Doesn't have to be half of the time. Any constant ratio works)
[00:12:30] <rpav> fuzzing or what
[00:12:51] <nq> I saw it at a conference, but forgot its name

[00:13:33] <rpav> well with that kind of specificity ;)
[00:13:50] <Alipha> MaddHatter: if the result of all floating point computations are divisible by 0.5, then yes, the `double` values should remain entirely exact (unless the values get larger than 2^53 or whatever)
[00:14:06] <Juliu> 91 is almost a prime :D

[00:15:39] <PJBoy> I've seen some others in the wild, but that's all I got
[00:15:39] <nq> rather, I think it was something used to generate random inputs based on the parameter list of a function; sorry, I saw it a long time ago and didn't actually get to it
[00:16:38] <PJBoy> intellitest is alright
[00:16:44] <PJBoy> although not C++
[00:16:55] <Juliu> Why can't I just randomly guess a password and succeed as long as a letter is correct in 1 out of 26 cases? :(
[00:19:39] <nq> how do you make asynchronous function calls in C++?
[00:19:58] <PJBoy> depends
[00:20:05] <PJBoy> I'd start at std::async
[00:20:35] <Juliu> Sounds like multitreading with all its pitfalls
[00:20:36] <PJBoy> https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/async
[00:22:32] <nq> so if the launch is async, it starts upon creation, and if it's lazy, it starts on request for evaluation ?
[00:22:44] * Juliu is sad that no one can answer his question
[00:23:41] <PJBoy> that sounds right
[00:24:18] <nq> but I don't understand the lazy one though
[00:24:44] <nq> doesn't it become sequential if it only evaluates when it's requested for ?
[00:24:58] <ville> it does "something"
[00:25:24] <PJBoy> you can queue up 100 deferred evaluations and they'll potentially all occur at different times
[00:25:30] <ville> as it it could launch right away in a separate thread, you'll be able to get the result at some point
[00:25:57] <PJBoy> so it's asynchronous with respect to other deferred threads and asynchronous with respect to the function that spawns those asyncs
[00:26:03] <ville> std::async() is basically useless
[00:26:19] <PJBoy> how'd you reach that conclusion?
[00:26:34] <ville> i've never found a use for it
[00:26:39] *** Joins: galik (~galik@cpc115028-bour7-2-0-cust153.15-1.cable.virginm.net)
[00:28:25] <nq> async can run on the same thread or on a different thread ? or always on a different thread ?
[00:28:26] <ville> if you're using threads then you probably care about performance? std::async() is so underspecified that it gives you no control over the system
[00:28:33] <MaddHatter> what was so bad about () for lambdas?
[00:28:38] <ville> nq: all of the above
[00:28:46] <nq> kk
[00:29:03] <nq> then what handles the scheduling for a thread, in a process ?
[00:29:15] <ville> unspecified
[00:29:24] <nq> so the kernel ?
[00:29:31] <ville> (well your operating system's scheduler)
[00:29:37] <PJBoy> async with launch::async policy always spawns a new thread and with launch::deferred never spawns a new thread
[00:29:45] <nq> ah, better
[00:29:58] <PJBoy> it's only unspecified if you specify both policies
[00:30:05] <keipi> ville pretty good use for std::async would be threads that can throw exceptions
[00:30:08] <nq> so the deferred one will run on the requesting thread, when requesting the evaluation ?
[00:30:38] <PJBoy> it will run in the thread that spawns the async
[00:30:41] <keipi> since those can't by caught by the starting thread when std::thread is used
[00:30:48] <PJBoy> which isn't necessarily the thread that requests the evaluation

[00:31:21] <nq> so the promise can be shared between threads ?
[00:31:41] <PJBoy> yeah sure
[00:31:46] <nq> and any of the copies can initiate the request for the deferred evaluation
[00:31:50] <ville> keipi: 0) don't use exceptions 1) if you for some reason do then just convert exceptions to error messages
[00:32:04] <Juliu> Is there a standard type for passwords, and maybe one that has a method to guess them?
[00:32:19] <PJBoy> well, std::future isn't copyable
[00:32:26] <PJBoy> but you can move the future to another thread
[00:33:26] <PJBoy> and I guess you can move a future into a shared_future, which is copyable
[00:33:39] <keipi> ville why not use exceptions? what would be the alternative?
[00:34:03] <nq> PJBoy: I see, thanks
[00:35:15] <ville> keipi: error codes?
[00:35:56] <MaddHatter> "standard type for passwords"? They're just strings...? If you are doing cryptography with them (and you probably are, because they're passwords, right), then your crypto lib likely has a "secure block" type that has additional protections like requesting not to be paged out, etc.

[00:37:20] <PJBoy> interesting in the twoset sense

[00:38:08] <MaddHatter> You know this is c++ right? This is not a language that has a one-line RunHttpServer() and StartDatabaseinCloud(). You have to build the lego yourself, brick by brick.
[00:38:18] <Juliu> Is there really something in C++ that let's the compiler know that you do not want the memory to be paged out?
[00:38:54] <MaddHatter> usually it's done through system calls, which are usually C, which c++ plays relatively nicely with

[00:41:17] <PJBoy> I don't have much to say to that :(
[00:41:27] <Juliu> Raziel, no :( That takes too much time. My question is why
[00:41:34] <Raziel> why what? v:
[00:41:41] <PJBoy> we all agree that only narrow minded people call other people narrow minded, right?
[00:42:19] <nq> MaddHatter: how does a type request not to be paged out ?
[00:42:21] <Juliu> PJBoy, I love when people say things like "All intelligent people do X" or "... don't do X"
[00:42:36] <Raziel> all true scotsmen love haggis
[00:42:41] <Juliu> nq, I would like to know that as well
[00:42:46] <PJBoy> like people that tell you to do your research, and then they only look at things through the lens of their conspiracy theory
[00:43:42] <MaddHatter> nq: I've not bothered to read beyond the documentation, so I don't know how it works. I know there are calls to make that request and I assume it allocates the bytes, makes the appropriate configurations on it, and then uses it after that.
[00:43:45] <Juliu> PJBoy, I started taking conspiracy theory as a compliment for a wise person nowadays, since so many conspiracy theories became facts in 2020 and 2021
[00:44:13] <Raziel> aw shit I'm going back to my refactorings
[00:44:18] <MaddHatter> nq: Usually it guarantees (again, I assume through the destructor) to zero the bytes afterward
[00:44:38] <PJBoy> so many conspiracy theories became debunked in those years too
[00:44:58] <Juliu> MaddHatter, do you really think that this is used when programs handle passwords? I doubt it
[00:45:01] <MaddHatter> nq: One example of such a thing though is CryptoPP::SecByteBlock, so maybe look there?
[00:45:32] <MaddHatter> I'm familiar with that because that's what I've used when handling passwords.
[00:45:32] <nq> MaddHatter, I see; so my understanding then is that it will use something other than malloc() possibly, it can allocate a whole page at once, mark it as "not-dumpable to disk", and also does the "zero the bytes" (a memcpy 0 for the whole page) in the dtor
[00:45:33] <Juliu> PJBoy, I don't know a single theory that got debunked. Often those debunkments themselves got debunked soon after
[00:45:59] <Raziel> PJBoy, help me refactor 20 year old shit "C++ is definitely just C with classes" code instead, it'll be more fun than this
[00:46:09] <nq> MaddHatter: are those blocks each a page, or are those pages managed by the library, possibly used by multiple blocks ?
[00:46:19] <PJBoy> for example, the conspiracy theories that the world would end in 2020 and 2021
[00:46:41] <MaddHatter> nq: the user requests whatever arbitrary size they want. Whether it's page-sized blocks underneath, I don't know. maybe?
[00:46:49] <Juliu> nq, can we even know what a page is or what physically consecutive memory is? I thought the whole idea was that we can't
[00:47:27] <Raziel> speaking of page, why the fuck do I have 60gb of shit cached to the disk pagefile
[00:47:38] <Juliu> PJBoy, never heard about a theory that the world would end in 2020 or 2021. Wasn't it 2012 ?

[00:47:53] <Raziel> who did I piss off to reach these heights
[00:48:04] <Juliu> PJBoy, give me another example
[00:48:07] <PJBoy> there's a lot of conspiracy theories
[00:48:21] <Juliu> Not many left that did not become facts
[00:48:21] <PJBoy> makes no difference whether you've heard of them or not
[00:48:39] <Juliu> PJBoy, give me one that I have heard of that got debunked
[00:48:40] <PJBoy> lots of science gets disproven, doesn't make being scientifically inaccurate a good thing
[00:49:45] * Juliu still wants to guess passwords
[00:49:58] <PJBoy> you're welcome to guess them
[00:50:08] <Juliu> That takes too long
[00:50:14] <Juliu> I just want to know them
[00:50:17] <nq> Raziel: how much of that might actually be shared virtual memory ?
[00:50:50] <Juliu> nq, what if the computer goes into hybernation mode and copies the memory content onto disk?
[00:51:25] <Juliu> What if the computer is a virtual machine and everything is on disk anyway
[00:51:31] <nq> it could also do that; but even wihtout hibernation, on my machine, the browser has a 26.5 gb of vitual memory, for just a few tabs (maybe 50)
[00:51:54] <Juliu> nq, close some porn tabs and it might run faster
[00:52:01] <nq> right
[00:52:06] <Juliu> 50 is really a lot
[00:52:08] <nq> I'll consider that.. maybe
[00:52:50] <Juliu> And then you realize that you are using Firefox, and no matter how many tabs you close, the memory is not freed until you close the whole program
[00:53:27] <MaddHatter> nq: a quick search later, it looks like mlock() and VirtualLock() are probably the most common/obvious approach
[00:53:32] <Juliu> PJBoy, maybe I just need a type/class that can produce all possible strings one after another?
[00:53:47] <Raziel> nq, most of it is probably irrelevant already but not cleared yet. just impressive how much it ballooned when I wasn't looking v:
[00:53:47] <cq-work> I will say, mlock and VirtualLock are not perfect.
[00:54:16] <Raziel> pretty sure most of it is from firefox not being restarted for a few days a while ago
[00:54:16] <cq-work> It heavily depends on the "vector" you're trying to protect against. Often, just make sure the buffer holding some secret is cleared is "good enough".
[00:54:28] <Juliu> MaddHatter, what library are they from?
[00:54:30] <nq> MaddHunter: are those like malloc() ? are they part of the std library
[00:54:45] <cq-work> mlock is posix, VirtualAlloc is Win32 API
[00:55:00] <MaddHatter> https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtuallock
[00:55:35] <Juliu> cq-work, somehow I doubt that anyone is doing that. Why would they? Either you have access to the machine or you do not
[00:56:30] <MaddHatter> I, too, always run everything as root /s
[00:56:47] <Juliu> lol
[00:56:53] <cq-work> It is not like that at all. Most vectors of attack are from remote locations, having local access to the machine is something completely different.

[01:04:52] <PJBoy> 100GB means 100 * 10^9 bytes by the SI standard

[01:05:20] <nq> there is SI standard for that ? :) didn't know this
[01:05:32] <nq> I guess it has to do with giga vs gigi or gibi or somthing

[01:07:47] <Juliu> It's actually weird that the k in the SI is a small k. Should be a large one, not just for bytes
[01:08:11] <PJBoy> nah it would be weird to see "destination is 5Km ahead"
[01:08:15] <PJBoy> also K is kelvin
[01:08:46] <Juliu> PJBoy, no, it would not. Actually km is weird. k = 1000 is larger than 1 and hence should be large, like all other prefixes as M or G
[01:08:49] <Raziel> yeha, K is kelvin, M is mega, m is milli but also meter
[01:08:51] <Raziel> ...woops
[01:09:04] <Juliu> Raziel, yes, damn Kelvin. Ruins everything
[01:09:32] <ville> Raziel: prefix vs unit, different class of things
[01:09:42] <Juliu> True, meters and milli both being m is also shit
[01:09:50] <Raziel> I'll still take some confusion between m and m over measuring things in dog's bollock-lengths
[01:10:08] <Juliu> So they should have made the k large!
[01:10:41] <Juliu> Raziel, that would be bad since d is already deci :P
[01:10:50] <Raziel> lol
[01:10:59] <Raziel> that is one you don't see often, but yes
[01:11:05] <Juliu> True
[01:11:18] <Juliu> dm^3 for example. Others call it a liter
[01:11:23] <PJBoy> except for dB
[01:11:29] <PJBoy> which isn't a decibyte

[01:16:22] <Juliu> Bytes are a dumb unit in the first place. Bits are better
[01:16:26] <johnny> jlink is sure setup weirdly.. it has a gui for things, but if there are any errors in initializing it, it just closes
[01:16:49] <johnny> i mean initializing the connection. not the program itself
[01:17:07] <johnny> which means if you don't run it from the cli, you won't get a hint as to why it failed
[01:17:41] <Juliu> So a decibyte is 0.8 bits?
[01:17:44] <johnny> and it certainly won't tell you that maybe you should have chosen swd instead of jtag . although that's not abnromal for these type of programs

[01:20:35] <Raziel> get to it
[01:21:03] <Juliu> PJBoy, teach me, sempai
[01:21:08] <Raziel> actually, permutations with repetitions
[01:21:19] <PJBoy> think you just want the power set of all valid characters
[01:21:32] <Raziel> PJBoy, is that what people call it these days?
[01:21:33] <Juliu> Raziel, somehow I still have the feeling that trying all passwords might take a bit long
[01:21:35] <nq> johnny: jtag sounds like that interface used for transmitting bit by bit along a chain of shift registers, I think
[01:21:37] <PJBoy> permutations sounds limited
[01:21:42] <Raziel> Juliu, no shit :p
[01:21:50] <Juliu> Raziel, so tell me a better way!
[01:21:53] <Raziel> PJBoy, permutations with repetitions is all of em
[01:22:43] <Raziel> Juliu, well that depends on your specific use
[01:22:48] <Raziel> because on the general case, there isn't a better way
[01:23:03] <PJBoy> isn't permutations with repetitions just where the order of equal elements is considered significant?
[01:23:05] <Juliu> Raziel, getting rich or world dominance. Either of those two. I have no decided yet

[01:23:27] <Juliu> Raziel, how can you say there is no better way? Stop lying
[01:23:32] <PJBoy> the various phrases that contain combinatoric words I find super unclear
[01:23:38] <Raziel> PJBoy, permutations with repetitions is n^k of the initial values
[01:23:57] <Juliu> Raziel, what initial values?
[01:24:08] <Juliu> What is n and what is k?
[01:24:23] <Raziel> eg if you have [1, 2, 3] as initial values, and you want permutations with repetitions of length 3, you'll get 9 collections, [1, 1, 1,], [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1] and so on
[01:24:37] <Raziel> Juliu, n is the size of the initial set and k is the length of your desired permutation
[01:24:45] <PJBoy> ah ok, wikipedia confirms
[01:24:53] <Raziel> in your case, your initial set/values should be a set of all characters accepted in the password
[01:25:14] <Raziel> and you'll have multiple ks, from the minimum password length to the maximum password length
[01:25:18] <Raziel> probably a whole lot
[01:25:27] <PJBoy> power set would be the wrong phrase then
[01:25:29] <Juliu> Raziel, well, not quite. n had to be the number of unique/distinct initial symbols

[01:26:25] <Juliu> Raziel, can't we just compute the password?
[01:26:31] <Raziel> Juliu, yes. which is the size of your initial set. because your initial set is made up of the unique symbols v:
[01:26:33] <johnny> luckily devices are cheap enough tehse days such that you don't have to do the stuff you used to have to, since the devices have fast cpus and a fair amount of storage
[01:26:44] <Juliu> Raziel, yes, "set", true
[01:26:44] <Raziel> compute what password from what data?
[01:26:56] <Juliu> Raziel, the public key
[01:27:23] <Raziel> haha, no. :p
[01:27:29] <Juliu> Raziel, why not?
[01:28:00] <Raziel> mostly because you don't have the (probably random) seed that was used to generate the key
[01:28:19] <Juliu> Raziel, lets just pretend we dont need that
[01:29:13] <TinoDidriksen> Let's just pretend one of the core features that make it secure isn't there?
[01:29:24] <Juliu> Raziel, all we have to do is password(public_key).get()
[01:29:37] <Juliu> TinoDidriksen, who ever said it was secure?
[01:29:42] <Raziel> sure, run the generation algorithm in reverse, done

[01:29:56] <Juliu> Raziel, yes, that's what I'm working on

[01:30:31] <johnny> i wish i had a better scope, but such is life :(
[01:30:33] <Juliu> .. well, at least I would. I have to finish this other thing first

[01:30:46] <Juliu> Raziel, help me!
[01:31:36] <Juliu> Raziel, tell me how to program it!
[01:32:54] <Raziel> well, I'd probably start with a qrng device placed in a magic circle situation in the correct alignment determined by the golden ratio, then get the seed from that and hope it decrypts the password
[01:33:25] <Juliu> What's a qrng device?
[01:33:31] <johnny> gotta be the right phase of the moon too
[01:33:50] <Raziel> johnny, yeah, and you need a complex system of mirrors to reflect the moonlight onto the qrng device
[01:33:56] <Juliu> johnny, that is achieved at least ones every 28 days and not hard
[01:33:57] <Raziel> Juliu, quantum rng
[01:34:01] <Raziel> those do actually exist, for what it's worth

[01:34:46] <Raziel> https://www.idquantique.com/random-number-generation/products/quantis-qrng-pcie/
[01:35:04] <Juliu> There is no reason to believe that quantum computers actually work

[01:37:10] <Juliu> Let's stick with normal computers and just get better in programming
[01:37:19] <johnny> so ou're just saying one of the most well tested theories in physics is just not true.. got it
[01:37:36] <Juliu> johnny, yes, that is what I am saying
[01:37:38] <Friithian> uh, so we just scrap the entire deal of quantum computers? even though we've put a lot of work into it and seem to be getting places?
[01:37:41] <Friithian> that's a horrible idea
[01:37:51] <Juliu> Friithian, yes
[01:37:59] <johnny> Juliu, i'm guessing you haven't really studied physics huh.
[01:38:12] <Juliu> johnny, true. But that does not mean that I am wrong
[01:38:16] <johnny> lol
[01:38:16] <Friithian> …
[01:38:36] <Juliu> johnny, can you prove non-determinism? I'm waiting
[01:38:44] <Friithian> ………
[01:38:53] <johnny> you can read hte papers that have already been written
[01:38:58] <johnny> why would i repeat what they said
[01:39:02] <Juliu> johnny, well, they don't prove it
[01:39:14] <Friithian> no, johnny, you yourselv must prove it. Reproduce all experimental results. Go, do it. :P
[01:39:17] <johnny> lol
[01:39:38] <Juliu> People are weird
[01:39:52] <johnny> just give me exclusive access to the large hardon collider.. screw everybody else who's acutally doing something useful with it right now.. so we can redo this all from first principles
[01:40:17] <Juliu> johnny, how would you prove that non-determinism exists? Seems pretty impossible
[01:40:30] <Friithian> prove it doesn't
[01:40:33] <Friithian> actually impossible
[01:40:47] <Juliu> The last time we gave the LHC to someone like you, we got the Mandela effect
[01:41:10] <johnny> me personally, i prefer to o with the best available knowledge atm , while keeping my mind open for other possibilities
[01:41:17] <Juliu> Friithian, yes and no. We could show that everything appears to be deterministic
[01:41:29] <johnny> we already went through htat with pysics pre 19000
[01:41:32] <johnny> 1900*
[01:41:41] <Friithian> that doesn't prove the non-existance of non-determ- fuck I am not drunk enough for this
[01:41:48] <Juliu> johnny, then you should not hope on quantum computers, but better invest your time to do the same stuff with normal computers
[01:41:50] <ville> this looks like -social material
[01:42:04] <johnny> i'm not that interested in quantum computing, i have no purpose for it.. i leave that to the real nerds :)
[01:42:13] <Juliu> Friithian, as I said, yes and no
[01:42:47] <Juliu> johnny, I just want to do it without quantum computers since I have no quantum computer at hand. Is that too much asked?
[01:43:02] <johnny> Juliu, i think they were just clowning on you
[01:43:16] <Juliu> johnny, really? How mean. I would have never thought that
[01:43:17] <johnny> maybe i didn't read all the discussion, but it sounded like they were saing you wanted osmething unfeasible
[01:43:32] <Raziel> Juliu, maybe if you had started bruteforcing it already instead of qqing, you would've cracked it by now
[01:43:35] <johnny> and rather than saying directly, they were joking with it
[01:43:37] <Raziel> :^)
[01:43:42] <Juliu> It's not as if I would be asking for the impossible
[01:43:52] <johnny> that's the thing.. pretty sure they disagree
[01:43:56] <Juliu> Raziel, that sounds unlikely
[01:44:02] <Alipha> the topic of this channel still has to relate to c++
[01:44:12] <Friithian> Alipha: what topic? :P
[01:44:13] <Juliu> Alipha, party pooper
[01:44:14] <johnny> was the original question by Juliu related to C++?
[01:44:27] <johnny> it sounded like it was, but again i didn't read the whole thing
[01:44:47] <Juliu> johnny, I made my inition question related to C++ on purpose, yes
[01:45:08] <Juliu> It's not as if we would have a different topic in here at the moment
[01:45:17] <johnny> for the purpose of starting a discussion on quantum computing? or to atually do something with it related to C++?
[01:45:37] <johnny> i mean to achieve a real goal using C++
[01:45:44] <Juliu> I did not bring up quantum computers, and I'm trying to tell them since 10 minutes that I do not want to consider quantum computing
[01:46:10] <johnny> so.. did any of you think it was possible without quantum computing?
[01:46:21] <Juliu> Me
[01:46:30] <johnny> other than you.. who's the one asking for help, and thus doesn't know
[01:46:34] <Juliu> :(
[01:46:34] <Friithian> what even was the original thing?
[01:46:38] <Juliu> lol
[01:46:54] <Juliu> Answering by saying "quantum computers!" without even knowing what the question was
[01:47:07] <johnny> i didn't say it was quantum computers myself
[01:47:18] <johnny> i guess Raziel would know
[01:47:21] <nq> how would you typically go about parallelizing a function's implementation ?
[01:47:22] <Juliu> My question was how to program calculating the password if you only know the public key
[01:47:39] <Friithian> oh, how to break public key encryption?
[01:47:39] <johnny> so the answer is.. you don't
[01:47:41] <Juliu> nq, depends on the function
[01:47:42] <Friithian> you can't
[01:47:46] <Friithian> that's like, the entire point of it
[01:47:47] <Juliu> johnny, bad answer
[01:47:54] <johnny> you bruteforce it.. that's how
[01:47:56] <Juliu> Friithian, also bad answer
[01:47:56] <nq> would you just sort of "divide the input space" ?
[01:47:56] <Friithian> Juliu: no it is an entirely perfect answer
[01:47:57] <johnny> or break the algorithm
[01:48:06] <Juliu> johnny, bruteforce is too slow. We already had that
[01:48:15] <johnny> then find a flaw in the algorithm
[01:48:17] <Juliu> Friithian, but it might be completely wrong
[01:48:19] <Friithian> Juliu: have you ever taken a class on encryption?
[01:48:23] <Raziel> johnny, quantum rngs and quantum computers aren't all that related
[01:48:30] <johnny> ah true
[01:48:32] <Juliu> nq, depends on the function
[01:48:41] <Raziel> qrng is just shooting photons at a barrier and seeing what side they end up on, basically
[01:48:55] <Juliu> Friithian, no. I'm not stupid and taking classes in fictional things that do not even exist

[01:49:00] <johnny> omg

[02:02:01] <Juliu> Friithian, there is a difference between me being able to, and it being impossible in general
[02:02:22] <Friithian> ok, find anyone who can figure out what that means

[02:02:40] <Friithian> thank god!
[02:02:52] <Raziel> how do I make that function set my s to nullptr

[02:03:25] <Raziel> Friithian, what's a good alternative? :p
[02:03:36] <Friithian> idk I think it is my end

[02:04:18] <Raziel> here's a godbolt instead :p
[02:04:40] <Friithian> in a fresh browser profile it works fine
[02:04:41] <Friithian> odd
[02:05:24] <Raziel> caching issues?
[02:05:35] <Raziel> or an addon fucking with it?
[02:05:43] <Friithian> most likely a privacy focused thing breaking it
[02:05:54] <Raziel> I guess, I have quite a few of those running and it's still fine though
[02:06:20] <Alipha> Raziel: what `s`? I don't see an s, unless I'm blind
[02:06:28] <Friithian> Alipha: first line of main
[02:06:30] <Raziel> Alipha, s is the std::string* in main
[02:07:16] <Alipha> Oh, I must have clicked on the wrong link
[02:07:40] <Alipha> Raziel: std::string*& str
[02:07:54] <Juliu> Friithian, why do you believe that cryptography exists?
[02:08:20] <Raziel> Alipha, fuck me, that's what I get for using refs all the time but not when I should apparently :p
[02:08:23] <Raziel> thanks
[02:08:55] <Raziel> uh oh. the callback handler in here only accepts void*
[02:08:59] <Raziel> so I guess I have to cast a bit...

[02:18:09] <johnny> sorry, i mean i have avoided templates in my own code for this embedded projet
[02:18:30] <johnny> so it looks more like java than modern C++ i guess

[09:28:25] <kalven> what do you need the getters and setters for?
[09:29:44] <ac_slater> oh right, I could make it all public
[09:30:53] <ac_slater> anyway, thanks guys
[09:30:58] <ac_slater> I'll paste something
[09:31:48] <ac_slater> I put some members variables in a protected base then do `public: using base::member_var;` to forward it to public on my derived. Someone suggested I just stop being lazy and do some getters/setters. But this applies to like ~30 classes

[11:23:46] <johnny> ac_slater, how is it lazy to have not have getters and setters? do they handle invariants or something?
[11:24:35] <johnny> in my normal non C++ coding, i tend to make objects immutable where possible, thus you set all the variables you can in the constructor and try to avoid setters especially entirely
[11:24:42] <ac_slater> I prefix most member variables with `m_`. So when someone sees access to `m_` that's not on `this`, they think it's a "smell". Like, make it clear your accessing another objects member

[11:24:57] <ac_slater> right
[11:25:30] <ac_slater> that's a good plan, but in my case, I pass around a mutable object sometimes - usually something to "fill". The relationships are very small so it's clear
[11:26:18] <johnny> if you're not doing any validation , then it's not really a smell
[11:26:55] <johnny> the getters and setters are just useless code
[11:28:13] <ac_slater> yea I agree

[11:37:36] <TinoDidriksen> I generally don't prefix variables at all, but I am directly opposed to prefixing public ones.

[11:39:05] <ac_slater> thanks guys
[11:39:48] <TinoDidriksen> Also, you mentioned "not on this" which insinuates that you're using this-> in code, which is also ugly.
[11:40:09] <Gvidon> Personally, I try not to mix public and private variables. They're either all public in case of a simple "struct", or they're all private in case of a more complicated "class". Yes, I know that there's no real difference between structs and classes in C++
[11:40:44] <Gvidon> And "struct" members are not prefixed
[11:40:49] <antto> i still use struct when i want mainly public access

[19:12:50] <Haohmaru> oh, here, SBRM <- the problem here IMO is that it still talks about "resources"

[19:13:08] <Haohmaru> i use RAII a lot for.. not resources
[19:13:18] <rpav> Haohmaru: but anything is a resource
[19:13:32] <Haohmaru> in my head RAII is more like "object birth/death does $things"

[19:13:59] <Haohmaru> whether those things are "managing resources" is a sepparate thing
[19:14:13] <rpav> well, what would _not_ be a resource
[19:14:14] <sonOfRa> They are things you use for their lifetimes, therefore resources!
[19:14:50] <Haohmaru> rpav i use a RAII object to generate pesky html things like:  "<blah>" ... then "</blah>"
[19:14:57] <Haohmaru> is that a resource?
[19:15:01] <sonOfRa> I'd say yes
[19:15:07] <Haohmaru> x_x
[19:15:38] <sonOfRa> it's a tag_generator<string> that, when it goes out of scope, closes itself
[19:15:39] <rpav> yes, becuase you're doing like `block blah("blah");` and blah is your block resource
[19:16:07] <rpav> it's not a great name either
[19:16:08] <Haohmaru> how about the RAII object that only temporarily overrides some value/state of something and then restores it afterwards?
[19:16:13] <rpav> what would be better than resource
[19:16:47] <rpav> note it has to encompass both actual resourcey things like allocations and file handles and other dubiously-resourcey things like temporary block scopes
[19:17:09] <Haohmaru> Object Lifetime Is a Function - OLIF
[19:17:12] <Haohmaru> is that better?
[19:17:13] <rpav> SBAM .. scope based action management
[19:17:29] <Haohmaru> okay, SBAM is better than SBRM
[19:18:26] <rpav> IFNDR .. SNAFU, FUBAR
[19:18:29] <Haohmaru> okay, i think i can invent an even better one
[19:19:39] <Haohmaru> something with Automatic Action
[19:19:50] <rpav> the problem with OLIF is it's _two_ functions, but you might have something like, Object Lifetime Is Around
[19:20:04] <Haohmaru> because { int x = 5; cout << x; } <-- x is an automatic variable, right?
[19:20:12] <rpav> but that's pretty terrible out of context and C++ doesn't really have :around things
[19:20:30] <rpav> well, `auto x = 5;` is ;D
[19:20:49] <Haohmaru> what was it called, automatic linkage?
[19:20:50] <rpav> is "automatic variable" even a thing anymore
[19:21:06] <rpav> it was automatic in that it was discarded automatically

[22:28:47] <rpav> Raziel: it becomes possible hypothetically with c++20 string template arguments
[22:29:11] <rpav> or at least non-stupid, because i think you can have e.g. `<char...>` pre-20
[22:29:20] <rpav> but string isn't constexpr, so you have to deal with that

[22:32:59] <rpav> pretty sure i see a path to doing this but i'll have to try wehn i fix this other thing
[22:34:13] <rpav> actually .. defining it might be a problem, i'm not sure how you can specialize `type_named` non-stupidly, as i don't think you can do like `template<> struct type_named<chars("foo")...>` or anything
[22:34:59] <rpav> and then you'd like want to macro that or something ;/

[22:41:02] <PJBoy> you could totally use a UDL to transform the "foo" string literal into something else
[22:41:19] <PJBoy> but that something else still wouldn't be a valid non-type template parameter until C++20, right?
[22:41:31] <rpav> not sure
[22:41:35] <PJBoy> maybe as an rvalue reference though
[22:41:45] <PJBoy> you can have references to anything

[22:42:05] *** Joins: letto (~letto@188.27.114.171)
[22:42:18] <PJBoy> you can stuff that parameter pack into a tuple and specialise on that
[22:42:25] <rpav> 🤔
[22:42:42] <rpav> no because a tuple takes types, not values
[22:42:57] <PJBoy> what about tuple(args...)
[22:43:10] <rpav> i need to specialize on non-type template parameters though

[22:56:11] <PJBoy> unless it's a void pointer or polymorphic base pointer
[22:56:11] <rpav> i mean you would have to at least manually define the mapping i think, via some `<> struct type_name<"double"> { using type = double; };`
[22:56:29] <rpav> well `type` is a polymorphic base pointer
[22:56:50] <rpav> err, i typed `type<T>`, but i meant `type` (and you have `type_impl<T>` subclasses)
[22:57:03] <PJBoy> function parameters are never constexpr, so you couldn't possibly change the return type of get() via the function argument
[22:57:12] <rpav> right
[22:57:32] <rpav> you would return a `const type*` which is a static variable return allocated in the function
[22:58:10] <rpav> this is partially what i was using the "external CRTP" for, so i could map `type_impl<int>` to something that _wasn't_ a specialization of type_impl<T>, but a subclass

[22:59:45] <rpav> i'm not sure how the constexpr map implementations work but i don't think you can use the tuple_getter method for a dynamic get(N) for this, since that depends on an index sequence
[22:59:51] <Raziel> rpav, sounds like you just want proper reflection at this point
