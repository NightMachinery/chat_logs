[16:57:31] <entuland> can't see the original scenario, can you re-post / recap it, arash?
[16:58:13] <arash> entuland, Hello, how can i align a element ? and why text-align: right; don't work for it ? https://jsfiddle.net/htv9o6mc/
[16:58:44] <arash> i think i findout , i should use margin or display: block; in order to do that. i should read more about inline and block elements
[16:58:59] <entuland> the text-align property will affect the alignment of the contents of the element
[16:59:16] <entuland> if the anchor took the entire width as a block, the text would have been pushed to the right
[16:59:21] <entuland> but there is very little context there
[16:59:34] <entuland> you normally don't want to use margins to move stuff around
[16:59:53] <entuland> but it's hard to say without knowing the surroundings
[17:01:17] <entuland> there are dozens of different techniques to align and center stuff around (some used to be good in the past and aren't good anymore, such as building main layouts with floats)
[17:02:08] <arash> entuland, well, i got some ideas from here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9721831/how-do-i-center-an-anchor-element-in-css/9721865. i just trying to learn about basics, "how can i align anchor tag" or difference between inline or block element, or why text align is not working in here

[17:04:46] *** Joins: lucerne (~lucerne@ip202.ip-51-178-215.eu)
[17:05:08] <entuland> the first reply there shows what I was explaining earlier, that the text-align will apply to the contents and not to the box of the element you apply it to
[17:05:51] <entuland> if you need to learn the various techniques you can look at tutorials and refer to the MDN docs, in particular to know the details about block vs inline-block vs inline
[17:06:01] <hassoon> arash: you cant just align an anchor element like that
[17:06:02] <entuland> cause they are meant to be used for different things and with different techniques
[17:06:14] <hassoon> arash: you either need to make it a block element, or align its parent
[17:06:40] <hassoon> i mean or you set the alignement rules on its parent, which happens to be the body
[17:07:10] <hassoon> arash: e.g https://jsfiddle.net/hassoon/sdu7ne91/
[17:07:44] <hassoon> arash: or that https://jsfiddle.net/hassoon/sdu7ne91/1/
[17:08:00] <arash> hassoon, thank you
[17:08:30] <entuland> one example with a flex layout with surrounding paragraphs: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/fensykj7/
[17:08:44] <hassoon> ya or flex approach
[17:08:50] <hassoon> which is the modern standard
[17:08:53] <hassoon> for centering things
[17:09:34] <arash> entuland, so the css is about box, then the text-align is only works to align the content inside this box and not move the box, is it true ?
[17:09:59] <entuland> correct, text-align will apply to the _contents_ of the element you apply it to
[17:10:13] <entuland> that's why hassoon used it on the _body_ and it affected your link
[17:10:18] <hassoon> no, the text-align is useless in the flexbox layout
[17:10:24] <arash>  unless we change it to a block element
[17:10:32] <hassoon> unless you set it on a child flex item that itself contains text
[17:10:44] <entuland> arash, no, it's not "unless"
[17:11:17] <entuland> give the anchor a background and you'll see that only the _contents_ of the anchor will be moved to the right, the box of the anchor itself will not be moved, it will simply take all the space there
[17:11:46] <hassoon> entuland: what ? it is
[17:11:49] <entuland> https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/79vgye4k/
[17:12:44] <entuland> what text-align does on the anchor when you set it as block and align left is moving the _text nodes_ contained by the anchor
[17:12:59] <entuland> s/align left/align right
[17:13:05] <hassoon> entuland: was talking about when he sets the a as a flex
[17:13:25] <hassoon> meh seems like we're not on the same page
[17:13:42] <entuland> arash did not mention flex in their question addressed to me
[17:14:23] <hassoon> ewwww meh
[17:14:24] <hassoon> 07:39 < arash> entuland, so the css is about box, then the text-align is only works to align the content inside this box and not move the box, is it true ?
[17:14:33] <hassoon> thought he is talking about flexbox when they said box
[17:14:42] <hassoon> * he said
[17:14:55] <entuland> can't be sure myself
[17:15:10] <entuland> what matters here is that the techniques are different and shouldn't be mistaken with each other
[17:15:25] <arash> hassoon, no, im not talking about flexbox, i just read somewhere "css is about boxes"
[17:15:35] <arash> one more question, so text-align do nothing for inline element ? is it true ? its not make sense to use text-align for inline elements. yes ?
[17:15:42] <hassoon> arash: ya the block levele elements are like boxes
[17:16:03] <entuland> arash don't be mislead by where the stuff is written
[17:16:12] <entuland> the stuff you put in your STYLE tag _is_ css
[17:16:13] <hassoon> arash: inlien elements are poor , they don't have dimentions or get aligned themselves
[17:16:16] <entuland> all of this is CSS
[17:16:53] <hassoon> meh anyway, entuland might have an ongoing explaination for you, g'luck
[17:17:35] <arash> hassoon, entuland ok, thank you
[17:17:45] <entuland> text-align directly applied to elements that are display: inline; is likely useless, yes
[17:18:02] <entuland> but it will still have an effect on inline-block elements
[17:18:03] <hassoon> entuland: inline elements are poor weaklings :|
[17:18:18] <hassoon> block levelers are like adults
[17:18:23] <entuland> inline elements have their use and they're not poor
[17:18:25] <hassoon> and flexboxes are like.. boses
[17:18:28] <hassoon> * bosses
[17:18:47] <hassoon> entuland: use for what ? text
[17:18:47] <hassoon> ?
[17:19:00] <entuland> yes, which is the vast majority of the content
[17:19:15] <hassoon> i write my text in a div element, how about that
[17:19:28] <entuland> the contents are still inline
[17:19:38] <hassoon> you're talking about textNodes
[17:20:02] <entuland> hassoon, I see no use about belittling some parts of the HTML and CSS that still have their uses
[17:20:14] <entuland> a developer has to know them and know when and how they matter
[17:20:26] <entuland> it's not like since we have block elements we should ignore how inline elements work
[17:20:34] <hassoon> entuland: fair enough
[17:25:04] <entuland> arash, an example of how block elements and inline elements interact with floated elements and how this is still relevant in modern CSS: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/3421dmts/
[17:28:16] <toddpratt> i like fresh red bell peppers
[17:28:22] <toddpratt> oops
[17:28:41] <toddpratt> wrong window
[17:28:59] <entuland> don't worry, no shame in red bell peppers :P
[17:31:22] <entuland> arash, another example that may confuse if one doesn't know what's happening: https://jsfiddle.net/entuland/fensykj7/1/
[17:31:54] <entuland> notice how I didn't explicitly change the anchor from inline to block, it's the flex layout on the parent that forced it to be converted
[17:32:53] <entuland> and notice that how "text-align", which normally makes no sense to a normally inline element such as <A>, does have the intended effect in such a case, as an alternative to "align-self: flex-end;"
[17:33:35] <entuland> that's why it is very important to check the docs about how such layout basics work and interact
[17:33:57] <arash> entuland, yes, i see. thank you. i should keep reading about it

[21:17:00] <entuland> yes, that article above is definitely outdated, ignore it
[21:17:50] <entuland> better to refer to the MDN documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position
[21:50:27] <jwpapi> On this page https://www.gregwilliams.com/product/cate-blanchett/
[21:50:27] <jwpapi> if you scroll down, there is an select inside a sticky CTA, which has an arrow inside. Following SO it seems like `appearance:none` is the answer to avoid this arrow, but that doesnâ€™t work. I also tried `-webkit-appearance: none` Iâ€™m looking at it on chrome mobile and desktop, + safari mobile
[22:02:24] <entuland> that appearance property _should_ work, not sure what's going on there exactly
[22:03:55] <jwpapi> Did you check thatâ€™s correct on my page?
[22:04:03] <entuland> it seems correct
[22:05:47] <entuland> ah
[22:05:56] <entuland> it's not the decoration of the select probably
[22:06:09] <entuland> it may be some other decoration created by whatever framework you're using
[22:07:09] <entuland> check the background of style.scss:1362 for example
[22:08:03] <entuland> yes, that's it, it's set in a lot of different places
[22:08:07] <entuland> so you need to override it
[22:08:53] <entuland> set background: none; directly on the element to see that it will take precedence, as a test
[22:10:50] <jwpapi> thanks
[22:10:52] <entuland> though, I'm not sure it's a good idea to hide that thing
[22:11:10] <entuland> cause the user loses the information about that thing being interactable
[22:11:12] <jwpapi> background none is working
[22:11:19] <jwpapi> entuland: thatâ€™s true
[22:11:32] <jwpapi> but showing the full text is too long
[22:11:41] <jwpapi> I  canâ€™t think of a smooth solution
[22:12:14] <entuland> that's definitely not the solution cause the space you're setting up for that isn't good for all numbers
[22:12:28] <entuland> select 30x40 and '' becomes ' only
[22:13:18] <entuland> it may screw up badly with other values
[22:13:30] <entuland> it already looks bad with "choose an option"
[22:13:58] <jwpapi> I have an idea
[22:14:15] <jwpapi> that works or? https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/vDFDpkV0/image.png
[22:14:30] <jwpapi> I increase max-width a big and give it just a big padding on the right side
[22:14:35] <entuland> that's better
[22:14:48] <entuland> you can tweak it little further by letting the cut text "fade" out
[22:14:51] <jwpapi> I canâ€™t do full text with that padding
[22:14:58] <entuland> without the abrupt vertical cut
[22:14:59] <jwpapi> entuland: how would you do that?
[22:15:44] <entuland> you could do some kind of linear gradient trickery with ::before or ::after
[22:16:02] <entuland> if you apply your latest change live I can fiddle with it
[22:16:12] <jwpapi> give me a second
[22:16:18] <entuland> sure, take your time
[22:16:21] <jwpapi> finishing my food :)
[22:16:26] <entuland> no rush
[22:22:28] *** night_wulfe_ is now known as night_wulfe
[22:23:06] <entuland> uhm... there may not be any ::before or ::after there since it's a select
[22:25:33] <jwpapi> oh entuland however I turned it live
[22:25:36] <jwpapi> Iâ€™m fine with how it is
[22:27:06] <entuland> yeah, probably not worth fighting there
[22:27:32] <entuland> though, pay attention that such widgets are OS dependent, and may get rendered with wild variations on different browsers / OSes / devices
[22:27:43] <entuland> if you care about that, do as much testing as you can
[22:30:53] <entuland> the slideshow on the homepage is disturbingly annoying... is it on purpose to have the frames swapped so quickly?
