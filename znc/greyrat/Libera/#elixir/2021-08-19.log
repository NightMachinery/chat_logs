[02:52:23] <rawtaz> interesting question

[02:53:42] <hoppity> a friend once said to me "hippity hoppity shut the f#ckoppity" and I found it too funny
[02:54:47] <hoppity> rawtaz: ^
[02:55:07] <rawtaz> lol
[02:55:53] <hoppity> rawtaz: how did you come up with yours? is it Raw Tazmania?
[02:57:17] <rawtaz> im not entirely sure. i can say though that i didnt think of that animated taz guy/devil in the road runner series. i just tried to come up with something unique (it actually was in every place i would search back then, although a few years later impostors started showing up :P) and this is what happened
[02:57:56] <rawtaz> so it's just a combination of words and sounds that felt good. i dont mean "raw" in the literal sense of the word or taz in relation to that show. thats just coincidence
[02:58:07] <hoppity> very interesting
[02:58:07] *** Joins: mahmutov (~mahmutov@5.176.12.39)
[02:58:26] <rawtaz> i think its kind of nice when people use "real" nicks instead of their names or similar, i.e. real handles.
[02:58:26] <hoppity> it is certainly memorable
[02:58:46] <rawtaz> but i also understand and respect and have no problem when they use their name or initials or whatever, thats fine too (and oftentimes easier in certain ways)
[02:58:50] <rawtaz> thanks :)
[02:59:02] <hoppity> I agree, plus I like the old days of the "anonymous internet"
[02:59:06] <rawtaz> yeah
[02:59:09] <rawtaz> old school
[02:59:19] <hoppity> I strongly dislike the new tendency to try to attach everything to your cellphone, etc
[02:59:44] <rawtaz> you mean like e.g. Signal where your phone number is the main ID to so speak?
[02:59:52] <hoppity> yes
[03:00:16] <hoppity> or "we need to verify you are a human so please give us your cellphone number" for Twitter and sites like that. Which I actually do not use.
[03:00:40] <hoppity> What happened to good 'ol captcha?
[03:01:13] *** Quits: james_lavin (~jameslavi@ool-457981b2.dyn.optonline.net) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[03:01:19] <rawtaz> oh yeah, that is just plain pathethic. if i dont want the additional safety net of security questions or a backup phone number or similar, i shouldnt be forced into it.
[03:01:32] <rawtaz> i think google and facebook are both requiring that?
[03:02:00] <rawtaz> ive totally given up on google accounts. they bricked a phone for me even though i am 100%+ sure that i knew the correct password.
[03:02:06] <hoppity> yeah exactly,  with Google I am kind of grand fathered in so they don't ask me for my number any more. And I do not have a Facebook.
[03:02:44] <rawtaz> and i can no longer help my dad with his e-mail because they require that logins are verified using his tablet. perhaps this can be turned off, but we never asked to have it turned on so bleh whatever
[03:02:58] <hoppity> That sucks dude, I have an old Android phone which I exclusively use to periodically wipe it and create new Google Accounts for whatever purpose.
[03:03:24] <rawtaz> nice :)
[03:04:13] <hoppity> I have my parents use my Next Cloud instance for as much as possible. That way I also ensure that their pictures are not lost or stolen.
[03:04:22] <hoppity> Though they still use Google for some things sadly.
[03:04:36] <rawtaz> what do you use for backing that one up?
[03:05:32] <rawtaz> yeah well i mean they spent like 15-18 years trying to get young you straightened out, the least they deserve is having some fun late in life by being an annoyance to their kid :-)
[03:05:55] <hoppity> haha exactly
[03:06:26] <hoppity> I am not too proud about this but I basically have an offlien 8TB hard drive that I periodically backup only the pictures and other important user folders to
[03:06:42] <hoppity> the nextcloud server itself runs on RAID 1 os I got that extra layer or protection too
[03:07:13] <hoppity> RAID 1 *array* is what I meant to say
[03:08:01] <rawtaz> i see. may i recommend restic.net for backing up your stuff? even if it's done to that hard drive. although if you can find offline storage you can use it to back up to there as well or instead.
[03:08:19] <rawtaz> (it only uploads what hasnt already been stored, block-wise deduplication)
[03:08:35] <hoppity> that is AWESOME, and precisely what I've been looking for. Thanks
[03:08:39] <rawtaz> shameless plug because it's not written in elixir

[03:09:18] <rawtaz> yeah, lots of good stuff. the encryption is sober and all of it enables restic to completely verify the data stored in your backup repository
[03:09:54] <rawtaz> no i did not, a splendid chap named Alexander Neumann did, and since then a lot of folks contributed very very good enhancements to it.
[03:10:16] <hoppity> I'm checking it out. It looks quite nice. Thanks for recommending it.
[03:10:28] <rawtaz> there is a #restic channel here on libera if you want to hang out there. no problem :)

[13:29:31] <Nicd> 👍
[13:30:16] <serafeim> i know it's small however it's invaluable to me because i re-invent the wheel (i.e how bootstrap modals work) to almost all my projects
[13:32:20] <serafeim> *and* the sweet alert bootstrap does not support bootstrap 5

[17:58:43] <sc_> Hi! I'm trying to call elixir code from C node.  If I call the erlang.is_alive from C using ei_rpc everything works well.  However, if I call the Elixir Node.alive? I get '{badrpc, {'EXIT', {undef, [{'Node', 'alive?', [], []}]}}}'. I'm calling the function like this: ei_rpc(&ec, fd, "Node", "alive?", rpc_in.buff, rpc_in.index, &rpc_out). Can you help me?
[18:02:09] <v0idpwn> sc_: I'm not really sure about how ei works, but I'd guess you need to use `Elixir.Node` instead of `Node`, given that an elixir alias `Foo` translates to an erlang atom `:"Elixir.Foo"`
[18:05:29] <sc_> v0idpwn: You are absolutely right! It worked!  Thanks you very much!

[18:55:18] <v0idpwn> Hey, elixir team! I miss being able to override `>>=`. This is the "universal" monadic bind operator, and its implementation varies depending on the data structure. I tried fiddling a bit with the elixir tokenizer and managed to get it to be overridable, but I'm not sure of the impact of this change (and think it is probably undesired due to snowball effect). Should I bother submitting a proposal or even a PR? In F#, it works like 
[18:55:18] <v0idpwn> a pipe on steroids (see https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/computation-expressions-bind/#a-standalone-bind-function), and I think it would be beneficial to have it as overridable in Elixir, so one can optionally do the same. I've seen some implement their ad-hoc binds with `~>`, but I think it looks bad. If they want to do it, why not allow them to use the universal syntax for it?

[20:13:14] <v0idpwn> azazel: I don't have a question :), I'm asking if this new overridable operator would be welcome in the language. So the link you gave me could use >>= instead of >>> if they wanted to. >>= is universally used for the `bind` operation. In the link you gave me, they're doing a dynamically typed result monad with tuples and implement the bind operation with `>>>`. They also do some more stuff, but out of my purpose

[23:39:57] <Nicd> wess: how did it go?
[23:40:08] <hoppity> I keep seeing this kind of error on the phoenix consol for my Phoenix app:  "19:07:37.722 [info] TLS :server: In state :hello at tls_handshake.erl:364 generated SERVER ALERT: Fatal - Protocol Version"
[23:40:15] <hoppity> Does anyone know what may be causing it?
[23:42:52] <Nicd> No more stack?

[23:43:15] <Nicd> Is this in prod?
[23:43:35] <Nicd> Do you have TLS turned on for Phoenix?
[23:44:16] <wess> Nicd powers up and sending commands
[23:44:32] <wess> feedback is going to be more of a pain than I realized
[23:44:37] <Nicd> Nice
