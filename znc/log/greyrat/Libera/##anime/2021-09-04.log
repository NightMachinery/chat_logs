[03:48:17] <Nanobot> Last night, I stayed up until 2am playing Minecraft, trying to make a contraption that takes a water bucket and empties it for you. Most of the work was getting it to fit into a very cramped space and keeping all the redstone hidden. I was so proud of it when I finally finished it. Then, I tried it out and discovered a fatal flaw I hadn't tested: dispensers can't empty water buckets into a waterlogged block. So, what I actually made was a sink where you 
[03:48:17] <Nanobot> can fill your water bucket by right-clicking on the water, or by putting it into the "drain" dispenser, but there's still no way to empty an already filled bucket in that room. T_T
[03:49:14] <Nanobot> The sink looks nice, though.
[03:50:48] <Nanobot> An additional complication is that there's an iron trapdoor right above the dispenser, and the trapdoor needs to always be powered. Which means the dispenser is always powered through quasi-connectivity. Yet, I need to be able to unpower and repower the dispenser to activate it. So, I had to use an inverted zero-tick pulse, which I sorta had to invent myself.
[03:51:07] <Nanobot> That trapdoor is the the waterlogged block, though.

[04:01:10] <MootPoot> Nanobot:  I need to know your fav hot sauces
[04:01:13] <MootPoot> for reasons
[04:01:13] <emmeka> Nanobot to clarify, are you trying to just empty the bucket in the dispenser so it can pick up water later, or do you actually need water to be placed there sometimes
[04:01:29] <emmeka> the easiest way is just to have some means of destroying the water block already there
[04:01:37] <emmeka> if it's the former
[04:01:48] <MootPoot> how tf
[04:01:57] <MootPoot> how do you know about minecraft stuff
[04:02:06] <emmeka> is it that surprising.
[04:02:12] <MootPoot> you're a literal dirt person with a carrot for a computer
[04:02:14] <MootPoot> YES
[04:02:18] <emmeka> MootPoot I was actually a Minecraft beta tester, believe it or not.
[04:02:34] <MootPoot> beta tester?
[04:02:41] <MootPoot> you bought it before the full 1.0 release?
[04:02:46] <emmeka> though that's not very impressive considering it was an open beta, but still, I've been playing it longer than most people, yes
[04:02:50] <MootPoot> or like super sekret beta
[04:02:56] <Nanobot> emmeka: The sink is a one-block infinite water source (because the other water sources it uses are hidden). But, because it's waterlogged, I can't empty a water bucket into it (right-clicking does nothing). So, my plan was for the drain of the sink (a dispenser just below the visible water source) to allow you to insert a water bucket and it would automatically empty the water upward into the existing water source.
[04:03:00] <MootPoot> I think I started playing MC in 0.8 or something
[04:04:19] <Nanobot> I started playing Minecraft in alpha, before biomes existed. A world was either "summer" or "winter" all the time. My first world was a winter world.

[04:05:50] <Nanobot> Oh. I'm watching the archive of Shion's latest Minecraft stream, and she accidentally just destroyed all of Gura's signs. It's like her heart stopped.

[04:07:40] <Nanobot> I think Shion is going to try recreating the signs exactly as Gura wrote them.
[04:07:53] <emmeka> Nanobot yeah, the only solution is having some alternate water-destroying mechanism, I think. but you could revise your approach and make a "1 block" infinite water source by having cascading pistons from a true infinite water source.
[04:08:00] <MootPoot> emmeka: at this point I'm not really sure how many Minecraft players are underage

[04:08:23] <MootPoot> I thought all the kids left for Roblox and fortnite 
[04:08:33] <Nanobot> emmeka: No room for any of that. It was really hard to get the redstone to fit here. It looks like there's absolutely zero room for redstone.

[06:56:31] <glestrade> Hi - I was wondering if there was anyone good enough at Japanese to tell me the non-literal meaning of an email address
[06:56:42] <glestrade> it looks like they‚Äôre trying to phish me
[06:56:45] <ButterNoodle> ?
[06:57:00] <glestrade> do you know japanese?
[06:57:00] <ButterNoodle> ##Japanese may help
[06:57:28] <ButterNoodle> there is only a few that speak it in here.. we are all weebs
[06:57:40] <glestrade> it‚Äôs a simple title

[06:58:07] <glestrade> I didn‚Äôt grow up watching anime
[06:58:41] <glestrade> but I‚Äôm joining the other one too
[06:59:21] <Nanobot> emmeka: I reverted the sink and added a dishwasher that toggles whether the bucket has water (and makes a dishwasher sound via a piston). Much simpler, since I don't have to do zero-tick shenanigans to keep a trap door up.
[06:59:32] <ButterNoodle> probably some colloquialism
[06:59:41] <glestrade> yes that‚Äôs what I figured
[07:00:00] <glestrade> the first two characters translate to ‚Äúthrowaway‚Äù
[07:00:21] <klaxa> a euphemism for ejaculation maybe?
[07:00:28] <glestrade> the next perhaps devil

[13:04:20] <Bco1981> i'm pretty happy with samsung ssd's and crucial and kinston
[13:04:46] <PancakeMatsuri> I got a kind of IPS specific to Samsung
[13:04:59] <Bco1981> AH-IPS ?
[13:05:03] <Bco1981> is best
[13:05:04] <PancakeMatsuri> Bco1981 Crucial P2 failed in 2 months in my Mac
[13:05:05] <ButterNoodle> that being said.. I have 6 samsungs, 3 dell, 4 lg monitors
[13:05:12] <PancakeMatsuri> Bco1981 probably
[13:05:21] <ButterNoodle> crucial is middle of the road
[13:05:24] <PancakeMatsuri> oh, LG, right
[13:05:24] <ButterNoodle> ssd
[13:05:26] <Bco1981> yeah
[13:05:42] <PancakeMatsuri> Crucial is shit in many ways
[13:06:00] <PancakeMatsuri> updating firmware on Linux was a quest
[13:06:08] <Bco1981> my first crucial, kinda died the other day... after 10 years
[13:06:20] <ButterNoodle> I have a few crucials
[13:06:27] <Bco1981> can't really complain about that.
[13:06:36] <ButterNoodle> they arent as shit as intels
[13:06:46] <Bco1981> ^
[13:06:49] <PancakeMatsuri> oh, Intel's are shit
[13:06:55] <PancakeMatsuri> didn't know
[13:07:17] <ButterNoodle> they are all shit compared to performance and reliability of samsung tbh
[13:07:39] <Bco1981> even kingston which you would concider low end
[13:07:49] <ButterNoodle> very low
[13:07:57] <ButterNoodle> I mean they have some better models..
[13:08:00] <ButterNoodle> but they are shit
[13:08:13] <PancakeMatsuri> I have a Kingston SSD. 32Gb, I think. Still works.
[13:08:17] <Bco1981> yes. but a okay cheap option, to get into ssd
[13:08:21] <ButterNoodle> WD has a few models that are comparable to samsung.. but they are probably samsung under the sticker
[13:08:31] <ButterNoodle> absolutely
[13:08:48] <ButterNoodle> I have a few of those cheap 240 gig kingstons
[13:08:55] <Bco1981> yeah :D
[13:08:56] <PancakeMatsuri> I got a 970 Evo Plus
[13:09:10] <PancakeMatsuri> in mail
[13:09:22] <ButterNoodle> whats that one dog shit brand 480 gig
[13:09:35] <PancakeMatsuri> ORC?
[13:09:39] <PancakeMatsuri> OCR?
[13:09:42] <Bco1981> samsung > crucial > kingston.
[13:09:47] <Bco1981> intel is not an option.
[13:10:00] <PancakeMatsuri> it's kinda Mac-targeted
[13:10:06] <Bco1981> pfft
[13:10:12] <PancakeMatsuri> but I heard complaints
[13:10:24] <ButterNoodle> patriot
[13:10:26] <PancakeMatsuri> so I went with an adapter and a stock drive

[18:33:59] <omero> is it acceptable to elicit opinions about a specific anime series here?
[18:34:13] <PancakeMatsuri> nsfw I guess
[18:34:29] <Bco1981> omero: sure
[18:34:29] <PancakeMatsuri> omero I think so
[18:34:41] <Bco1981> jyust try not to spoil
[18:35:24] <omero> I just finished watching Space Battleship Yamato 2202: Warriors of Love
[18:35:37] <omero> and that was the reason I asked, Bco1981 
[18:36:03] <omero> I was kind of disappointed.
[18:36:32] <omero> the 2199 one... was AWESOME!
[18:36:44] <omero> it made me feel young again.
[18:37:06] <omero> but... 2202 was kind of ... meh.
[18:37:48] <omero> now, I learn that there is a 2205 coming soon
[18:38:51] <omero> but if that is going to be like 2202... I think Ill give up the hopes.

[18:41:45] <omero> cant find anything relevant pertaining to 2205... that I can read without recurring to 'translators' << total crap, if I may say.
[18:42:27] <omero> thus... I was just curious. is it all hype?
[18:42:51] <Bco1981> haven't seen that series yet. So don't really know.
[18:43:08] <omero> I understand the project has been delayed and had a troubled path to get done

[18:47:51] <omero> Im at the last episode of galaxy express 999 
[18:48:01] <Sxem> im watching + 0 2015 Mobile Suit Gundam - Iron-Blooded Orphans S01-02 BIG
[18:48:01] <Bco1981> it's a bit too out there to binge.

[18:48:27] <Bco1981> get more storage
[18:48:32] <Sxem> i just have 9 big shows left
[18:48:36] <omero> never watched GE999 back then... (because of gundam, yamato and ... wow... harlock)
[18:48:57] <omero> is that any good Sxem ?
[18:49:04] <Sxem> i am up to 2014 in anime. i cant get more until verizon stops blocking nyaa

[18:50:11] <omero> there is another
[18:50:12] <Sxem> 88 means hh or heil hitler

[21:18:23] <mixfix41> she also did the review the the gave my sister ass hemmoroid
[21:19:03] <Bco1981> guess there is a limit to how much you should put a dildo up your ass.

[21:21:00] <Sadale> Perhaps it's possible to train to stuff in more dildos :3
[21:21:27] <Bco1981> Sadale: you shouldn't try everything you see in hentai
[21:21:33] <Sadale> xD
[21:21:56] <Sadale> Probably fun to try it out with my own ass tho :3
[21:22:08] <Bco1981> sounds painful
[21:22:28] <Sadale> lube
[21:22:50] <Sadale> first get a smaller one and with just one. Then get a larger one. Then get multiple ones and so on
[21:23:21] <lastonestanding> is that your daily routine?
[21:23:36] <Sadale> nope, unfortunately
[21:24:09] <Vohveli> what is the end goal here
[21:24:52] <S_T_A_N> To take 10 dildos up the ass
[21:25:19] <Vohveli> why not just buy something that can fit 10 dildos in it
[21:26:01] <Bco1981> that american challenge thing ? or what it was called.
[21:26:02] <Sadale> so that I can break the world record?
[21:26:43] <Sadale> seriously tho, better not to try it so that you won't hurt yourself (duh! xD)
[21:27:09] <Bco1981> yeah, the world record isn't the only you will break

[23:03:48] <davic> or well you cant order in english

[23:05:22] <davic> and hope I did correct
