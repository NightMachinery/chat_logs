[00:49:12] <Noisytoot> sending youtube links puts load on youtube
[00:49:37] <Noisytoot> the main issue with putting load on one server is it getting blocked by youtube
[00:50:15] <M6piz7wk[m]> privacyredirect in icecat doesn't even open youtube it seems
[00:52:28] <M6piz7wk[m]> which to me seems like an optimal implementation just having a list and using random instance from it to open the video

[01:33:42] <Myrcy> sorry to answer my own question, it seems it is: https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/LBRY_Desktop
[01:36:28] <Myrcy> but it appears their web app is not, I'd rather remain using PeerTube then.
[01:39:17] <netRunner57> Odysee is not limited by LBRY inc standards
[01:39:34] <netRunner57> so right now the code is at least "open source"
[01:40:02] <iShareFreedom> free software!!
[01:40:12] <netRunner57> but the code for the lbry desktop app is licensed under the MIT (Expat), so it is fully free, and it will remain that way since it is made by LBRY inc
[01:40:41] <iShareFreedom> you say X license?

[01:42:29] <netRunner57> no no, Odysee was part of LBRY, but now the people working on Odysee have split up
[01:42:49] <netRunner57> they now do their own thing, trying to make a platform for indie video makers
[01:43:01] <netRunner57> their front end started as a fork of lbry webapp

[01:43:09] <netRunner57> but they no longer have to remain free
[01:43:26] <netRunner57> I think they didn't like the restrictions LBRY imposed on them
[01:43:37] <netRunner57> the LBRY desktop app is fully free though
[01:43:48] <netRunner57> and LBRY is just a protocol, so anyone can make their own clients
[01:44:15] <netRunner57> I once saw a terminal client being made, and I myself sometimes just add channels to my rss feed and watch video through there
[01:45:35] <netRunner57> The source code id hosted over at github, so I don't know if I am allowed to share the links

[01:50:13] <iShareFreedom> yes netRunner57, lbry-desktop is free software by the license
[01:50:32] <iShareFreedom> and mit isnt a license, realy is a bad name, the license is X11
[01:50:56] <iShareFreedom> here a lit of information https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License
[01:51:24] <iShareFreedom> but, be careful with it becouse dont have copyleft, and maybe they can introduce nonfree software, so see good what are you installing!
[01:51:36] <netRunner57> Yeah I saw that a while ago, but I forgot the real name lol
[01:51:56] <netRunner57> and I agree, it sucks that it uses the MIT, but at least it is a start
[01:52:13] <netRunner57> I hope someone can make an alternative with a copyleft license sometime in the future

[14:56:59] <leah> oh?
[14:57:37] <leah> i don't currently sell osboot-preinstalled machines btw. but i'm planning to change that
[14:57:40] <GNUmer> Honestly, I would be glad to get my relatives to even stop using Microsoft Office.
[14:57:59] <leah> i discontinued the x230 on minifree to sell x200 because i have a huge surplus of them. despite reported stock shortages elsewhere, they are readily available to me in the UK
[14:58:22] <GNUmer> leah: No worries. I got mine from a local vendor and I'm just waiting to order a couple wireless cards from ThinkPenguin.
[14:58:31] <leah> x230?

[14:58:55] <leah> it's a really great machine. and tied with the fsf's true random number generator, can be used for secure setups
[14:59:06] <leah> for example, say you want to create a seed for a bitcoin wallet
[14:59:20] <leah> GNUmer: i recommend Heads for now though
[14:59:46] <leah> osboot is very new and experimental, and Heads currently does a better job on that machine. but i'm working on a busybox+linux distro similar to what they have. i hope to have it ready in the next few weeks

[15:05:07] <GNUmer> With my laptop and the ThinkPenguin wireless card, I'm not sure if it's going to work that well with the exam system here in Finland. Although it's based on Debian and the Github page has it licensed with GPL, they don't really enforce it well. Previously, they violated all copyrights of third-party programs except the proprietary ones, which prompted me into action and got the national school administration a lot of backslash. Now I'm tryi
[15:05:07] <GNUmer> ng to get them to release the kernel build files as they should release. They use free software but yet don't enforce it nor respect the upstream developers' demands to have it free. Finding the drivers is also a pain. I had to read through the kernel config to find out the drivers since they don't release that information on their website.

[15:07:00] <leah> anyway, great job
[15:08:39] <GNUmer> Btw, does the GPLv2 license require the kernel to be buildable? The exam system and the repo is missing a lot of build files.
[15:12:06] <kilobug> GNUmer: GPLv2 says "complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable." so missing build files are likely a violation, yes

[15:32:29] <leah> DiffieHellman: there are numerous examples of nominally free software that isn't really free. I categorize them, thus:
[15:33:14] <leah> * horribly written code, that isn't easy to read or understand, and is poorly documented if at all. the freedom to modify is, in practise, heavily curtailed. such code is only useful as a reference, subject to a rewrite
[15:33:59] <leah> * as pointed out here, code that no longer compiles. however, i would caution: so long as the code is well-documented, i would consider it useful and free in practise. making it build again is possible, if the logic is clear
[15:34:20] <yrk> like anything written in perl
[15:34:27] <leah> * well-written or reasonably well-written code, that has comments scrubbed, and documentation withheld
[15:34:35] <leah> i can give examples of all three
[15:34:44] <DiffieHellman> Ehh, even if the code is poorly written, it's still free unless it's intentionally obfuscated. 
[15:35:02] <leah> i consider all 3 types of software non-free in spirit
[15:35:21] <leah> in practise, and in terms of the law, they are free, but it's more like throwing code over the wall, and it just about gets over the wall
[15:35:28] <leah> what do you think happens on the other side of that wall
[15:35:35] <DiffieHellman> Readble source code is a hell of a lot more useful than binary blobs.
[15:36:07] <leah> on the other hand, there are sadly numerous cases of something being spiritually free but some legal technicality makes it not so
[15:36:20] <DiffieHellman> Nothing much until someone comes along and fixes that code up - like anything really.
[15:37:32] <DiffieHellman> It's not "non-free is spirit", closer to "not very useful". Unintentional bad programming is not nonfree.
[15:38:01] <leah> if microsoft released windows xp under the GNU GPL, i think it'd still be non-free in practise, as per the 3 examples i gave. it'd probably be the first one
[15:38:19] <GNUmer> It's quite ridiculous, that the organization that I'm talking about had an instrumental part in Linux's development and still doesn't respect the license of the kernel. Although they have lawyers, they've only cared about the copyrights and the licenses of the proprietary software shipped with the system.
[15:38:25] <leah> im imagining it to be spaghetti code probably. some of it probably hardcoding a lot of magic numbers and hand-written assembly code everywhere
[15:38:53] <leah> it'd only be useful as a reference. (but then, reactos could use it as such, to make something actually useful)
[15:39:19] <DiffieHellman> leah: If you release something under a free software license, it becomes free software. It may not be useful, but it isn't nonfree.
[15:39:26] <leah> real-world examples:
[15:39:44] <leah> * 3rd bulletpoint: a lot of the AMD AGESA code in coreboot has comments and documentation scrubbed
[15:40:11] <DiffieHellman> Asshole behaviour but still not nonfree.
[15:40:13] <leah> * 2nd bullet point: lots of static u-boot releases, provided by router manufacturers, to comply with GNU GPL
[15:40:34] <leah> * 1st bullet point: glibc :P
[15:41:07] <leah> we have to consider many things besides just licensing, is all i'm saying
[15:41:15] <leah> that's a nuance which many non-programmers miss
[15:41:46] <DiffieHellman> AMD AGESA was a hell of a lot better when AMD actually provided it. All they provide now is proprietary blobs.
[15:41:47] <leah> a giant pile of spaghetti under GPL is less useful. you want the code to actually be readable and easily maintainable for whoever looks at it
[15:41:54] <leah> DiffieHellman: yeah
[15:43:13] <DiffieHellman> static u-boot is meh, but really I doubt router manufactures made changes beyond appeasing the hardware, so all that's important is that the router can have free software installed.

[15:45:36] <leah> in the context i'm thinking of (mips routers) it's usually embedded into some image in nor flash (spi)

[15:46:15] <leah> that includes u-boot
[15:46:42] <fatal> not installed, nope.
[15:46:50] <leah> it's not uncommon for a new router on the market to use a u-boot version forked like 10 years ago
[15:47:01] <leah> and the manufactured has bodged the code ever since, for each product that they sell
[15:47:14] <leah> manufacturer*
[15:47:35] <DiffieHellman> Sad, but if the GPL obligations have been met and the images boot correctly, it's more of an annoyance mostly.
[15:47:41] <leah> which in and of itself is not a problem
[15:47:53] <leah> but there is only 1 developer: the engineers who worked on that code, who no longer work on it
[15:48:04] <leah> so what you've got is abandonware right out of the box, with like, no support
[15:48:44] <leah> (also, sometimes manufacturers violate the GPL)
[15:49:26] <DiffieHellman> Manufacturers commonly violate the GPL. Almost every Android phone violate the GPL.

[15:51:34] <fatal> i just want to call someone and complain
[15:52:22] <leah> anyway, postmarketOS is really great if you need a phone
[15:52:28] <DiffieHellman> It's common for drivers to be linked via ioctl's against a version of Linux, creating a derivative work moreso than utilizing general kernel functions. Then the drivers are released as proprietary software. 
[15:52:31] <leah> based an alpine linux. uses busybox, linux and musl
[15:52:43] <leah> and they have stuff in postmarketOS to make even non-mobile-aware applications work nicely
[15:52:45] <fatal> yeah like i thought, no license and it's already preinstalled.
[15:52:47] <GNUmer> https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=VGFdvw8cOR4 is the link for the video for most of us who don't want to use YouTube.
[15:52:50] <leah> based on*
[15:53:03] <DiffieHellman> leah: Based on Alpine BusyBox/Linux you mean?
[15:53:17] <leah> whatever
[15:53:44] <leah> anyway, the reason pmOS is better is because you can use normal applications on it
[15:54:17] <leah> combine that with a lightweight DE like https://sxmo.org/ (based on dwm)
[15:54:30] <leah> and you've got a highly reprogrammable computer in your pocket
[15:54:39] <DiffieHellman> Does postmarket OS include any proprietary libraries at all (besides the garbage needed for the celluar modem)? LineageOS for example contains nonfree libraries.
[15:54:50] <leah> i'm not sure
[15:55:00] <leah> probably the only thing they have is linux firmware, i'm guessing
[15:55:11] <leah> which you can just not install, if you want fsdg
[15:55:19] <leah> or compile linux-libre
[15:55:45] <GNUmer> Digit: And yet they mentioned "open-source" software instead of free software. I'm still furious at Eric S. Raymond and the OSI for crediting most free software as "open source software", taking away the philosophy behind the philosophy of free software.

[16:18:09] <Armand> That's... memory management
[16:18:12] <Armand> O_o
[16:18:51] <Armand> Haven't heard of anything real specific on ARM that I should be overly concerned about.
[16:19:04] <leah> Armand: i think in context, DiffieHellman is most likely thinking of the baseband processor in your phone, which has direct cpu/ram access and the network operator can potentially gain access to your phone that way
[16:19:17] <Armand> Admittedly, I'm a bit lax with the updated on security these days.
[16:19:29] <leah> for communicating with the cell tower i mean
[16:19:35] <Armand> Humm
[16:19:49] <leah> it's a known problem
[16:19:59] <Armand> They are obligated to the same laws as I am.
[16:19:59] <leah> phones are usually insecure
[16:20:21] <DiffieHellman> Yep. Some newer phones have IOMMU to prevent the baseband processor from getting direct RAM access, but IOMMU never is perfect.
[16:20:46] <Armand> There's nothing that permits them "control" over my phone.. 
[16:21:26] <DiffieHellman> The fact that the baseband processor is probably on the same SoC and has direct RAM/CPU access permits full control.
[16:22:50] <DiffieHellman> The only mitigation to this problem is to connect to the baseband processor with a protocol that doesn't do IOMMU (like usb) and then treat the device as malicious, as it is.
[16:23:41] <DiffieHellman> The law obligation doesn't bother them as a judge is not going to understand the nuances of baseband technology and remote control actions aren't really detectable.
[16:23:58] <Armand> That's an assumption.
[16:24:13] <Armand> Thankfully, laws are pretty clear on acts of misuse.
[16:25:59] <DiffieHellman> Laws may be clear, but it's very hard to actually enforce such laws as the technology is proprietary. Sure you can reverse engineer the chipset and log the remote access, but such reverse engineering apparently broke the DMCA or something, so you won't be able to submit that evidence in court.

[16:35:56] <DiffieHellman> Also, what do you mean by "crashing"? You mean kernel panics? If it's hardware failure, another distro's not gong to help.
[16:38:31] <Kaiod> DiffieHellman: It's not a hardware failure, it gives a few too many silly problems that annoy me a bit, and so, anyway, I've taken advantage of the "half dissatisfaction" with Debian and already decided to switch.

[19:59:26] <Noisytoot> It's at LibrePlanet.

[20:00:02] <Armand> Because there's no such thing as "lung zombies", Noisytoot ?
[20:00:15] <Noisytoot> Armand, Also because it's over BigBlueButton.

[21:35:29] <leah> which provides almost everything
[21:35:35] <TheOwlLady> <monkwitdafunk>: I guess so

[23:23:00] <craigt> tfisgnag: With Mailvelope, we only need to be concerned with Mailvelope GmbH.
[23:23:39] <tfisgnag> craigt: OK. About 20 minutes ago you said that "Mailvelope GmbH is obviously the owner". Why did you use the word obviously? I didn't find it in the Readme. md file. Where did you find that Mailvelope GmbH is the owner?
[23:23:40] <craigt> tfisgnag: We will see as we look through the code base, that the code files have headers with copyright notices. We just aren't there yet.
[23:24:30] <craigt> tfisgnag: I spent some time looking around https://mailvelope.com/
[23:25:42] <craigt> tfisgnag: They listed as their website in the readme file.
[23:26:05] <tfisgnag> craigt: OK. Understood. Do we leave looking through the code base for next Friday?

[23:26:49] <craigt> tfisgnag: We are at a good place to stop. 
[23:27:16] <tfisgnag> craigt: OK. Have a nice week.
[23:27:22] <craigt> tfisgnag: Any other questions about the readme file at this point?
[23:27:27] <craigt> tfisgnag: You too.
[23:27:46] <tfisgnag> craigt: no questions
