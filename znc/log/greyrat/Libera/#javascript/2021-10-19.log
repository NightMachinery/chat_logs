[00:15:42] <diophantoz> what is a good way to deal with elements (or nodes) that are deep down in the node structure? say they have no id/class identifier
[00:16:28] <diophantoz> example: <div id="foo"><ul><li></li></ul></div> and i want to get to <li>
[00:20:02] <hax> you could use el.childNodes[] to get all children, or el.children https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-get-child-element/
[00:21:03] <theskillwithin> if you know its li maybe getElementsByTagName

[00:24:13] <diophantoz> yes that can work but if there is another div with li-elements

[02:39:43] <sheetjs> then that is expected behavior.  bans last a day
[02:39:51] <sheetjs> you have to tell it to extend the ban

[09:05:37] <gkatsev> which, probably isn't as big of a deal for seinfeld as it was for the simpsons

[09:15:34] <sickdyd> I will try
[09:16:44] <ThePendulum> the Simpsons or Seinfeld?
[09:16:47] <theskillwithin> theres something about comedy that is unpure but also very pure.  comedy is a true art form.  there are more people in the world that are good at brain surgery than there are good comedians
[09:17:02] <sickdyd> Seinfeld
[09:17:04] <ljharb> gkatsev: what simpsons thing
[09:17:16] <Maxdamantus> 9 seasons.. don't think I can be bothered.
[09:17:44] <ThePendulum> most good brain surgeons are probably more universal with brains than comedians are with senses of humor though
[09:17:50] <sickdyd> the Simpsons were super popular

[09:18:26] <ljharb> Maxdamantus: totally worth it
[09:18:35] <ljharb> it's 9 seasons of 22 minute episodes, because it had ads
[09:18:38] <ThePendulum> never watched a full episode of Seinfeld, the few bits I saw didn't appeal to me at all. then again I got into friends like 15 years too late
[09:18:57] <ljharb> ThePendulum: start at the beginning and push through then
[09:19:09] <ThePendulum> the show, not like, actual friends, I wouldn't take that risk
[09:19:23] <sickdyd> lol
[09:19:38] <Maxdamantus> Looks like about 16 episodes per season, so 3168 minutes, 52 hours.
[09:19:45] <ThePendulum> a teacher I had in college looked like one of the guys from Seinfeld and I regret not being able to acknowledge it at the time
[09:19:56] <sickdyd> I enjoyed Trailer Park Boys
[09:19:58] <Maxdamantus> Maybe I'll try watching the first season.

[09:20:46] <Maxdamantus> imo the office is good (at least UK version, haven't really watched US version)
[09:20:49] <gkatsev> ljharb: but it's worse on the simpsons because there's a lot more various gags and stuff on the edges
[09:20:52] <ThePendulum> hmm imo the Office is pretty much the only show where I like the US version more than the UK version
[09:21:03] <gkatsev> famously, the duff, duff lite, and the other one all coming from the same pipe
[09:21:06] <theskillwithin> Maxdamantus what about UK version of house of cards
[09:21:22] <Maxdamantus> (watched the first episode of the US version but seemed to be basically the same plot as the UK one, but less funny watching a remake)
[09:21:32] <sickdyd> I actually really liked Bloodline except for the last 2 episodes that made me regret I started watching it

[09:23:08] <ljharb> gkatsev: gross
[09:23:36] <ThePendulum> Friends is syndicated over here all the time Seinfeld practically never, something about it seems less compatible somehow
[09:23:39] <gkatsev> ljharb: they did work on it and fixed it, and I think there's a toggle or two versions or something
[09:23:58] <gkatsev> ljharb: for those folks that have an irrational hatred of pillar boxes
[09:24:24] <gkatsev> seinfeld used to be syndicated a lot more, it's definitely less common recently

[13:05:30] <jaawerth> stenno: sure, you can tree-shake anything and both it and ramda have put consideration towards that usecase - in lodash's case, regular stuff you could use with common-shake, but they also iirc publish individual functions as modules as well as an es module package. there's some twisty interdependencies but tree-shaking would still help.

[13:12:52] <jaawerth> stenno: I guess it depends on how far it goes into dead code elimination territory, but lodash and ramda have both been modularized for some time

[13:14:46] <DnzAtWrk> but it was many years ago
[13:15:02] <jaawerth> ehhh arguments.callee is an error in strict mode, which for all practical purposes is the standard mode since ES modules implicitly enable it (plus not using it makes your code both less reliable/predictable *and* slower)
[13:15:24] <stenno> DnzAtWrk: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#arrows--one-arg-parens
[13:15:24] <jaawerth> in no-strict mode, for example, you get implicit globals, and mutating the arguments object actually mutates the named args

[13:15:59] <DnzAtWrk> that is a perfectly reasonable argument

[13:17:18] <jaawerth> strictly speaking you probably shouldn't have to code around your tools like that, but... that no-dangling-commas diff churn is super annoying and it isn't going away anytime soon, it's the main reason I adapted dangling commas everywhere applicable across the board

[16:05:42] <fakuve> Hi guys , so I'm still with yesterdays function . I'm in need to avoid JS to convert a string into Number datatype as it is messing with the leading zeros that need to interpret ( https://hastebin.com/adomerigah
[16:07:09] <NoiseEee> fakuve: then keep them strings
[16:07:16] <NoiseEee> start them out as strings
[16:07:16] <fakuve> ah noh I think is working now
[16:07:16] <Cork> fakuve: if you want it to not convert it to number you need to avoid 0x and +=
[16:07:35] <Cork> cause that is a nummeric notation
[16:08:05] <Cork> ByteArray is for example an option
[16:08:20] <fakuve> So I need to declare them as `var myString = New String("");` ?
[16:08:30] <Cork> no just ""
[16:08:46] <Cork> but let	outputColor = 0x00; is not a string and won't ever be a string
[16:08:58] <Cork> same with outputColor += 0x00aa00;
[16:09:07] <Cork> 0x00aa00 is identical to outputColor += 0xaa00;

[17:38:18] <iffraff> for the love of god, if it's not one thing, it's the other.  Now prettier is messing up the formatting by adding two spaces and I get an mixed spaces and tabs error!  uggg

[17:42:36] <thykka> tabs are tabs
[17:42:41] <iffraff> well, I'm using tabs not spaces, tabs are 2 space length.  But I can do tab->tab->space:space  if that makes any sense

[17:43:06] <iffraff> sorry I can't* do
[17:43:17] <thykka> using spaces for indentation is a form of fascism
[17:43:39] <iffraff> that's a bit extreme, but it is ... wrong
[17:44:00] <efdee> spaces are the one true way
[17:44:10] <thykka> it's like, "I don't care about your preferences, everyone will have it indented as much as I want!"
[17:44:29] <thykka> meanwhile, tabs can be configured to appear as wide as the user wants
[17:44:38] <banana_> set "useTabs" to false
[17:45:00] <thykka> might as well use fibonacci indentation at that point
[17:45:03] <banana_> "useTabs": false and then I think it converts your tabs to spaces
[17:45:09] <efdee> thykka: i don't care about your preferences in my codebase
[17:45:29] <banana_> space vs tab holy war
[17:45:47] <banana_> why are tabs better than spaces
[17:46:09] <ThePendulum> never quite got the argument for spaces, I have one project with one and another with the other and it literally makes no difference
[17:46:10] <banana_> because you can customize what a tab is like in microsoft word?

[23:14:06] <fakuve> Hey there guys , I'm having a hard time linking a CDN from unpkg . so I got recommended this link https://unpkg.com/browse/css-animation-sync@0.4.1/ , for what I understand I have to grab <script src="https://unpkg.com/browse/css-animation-sync@0.4.1/dist/sync.js"></script>
[23:14:54] <stenno> don't you have to add some nonce for SOP?
[23:15:12] <sheetjs> no "browse"
[23:15:13] <fakuve> Problem is that there doesn't seem to be no authenticity checksum on unpkg of some sort and when trying to parse I get a CORB problem
[23:15:18] <stenno> oh lol
[23:15:37] <sheetjs> fakuve: dont put a trailing slash

[23:15:51] <sheetjs> https://unpkg.com/css-animation-sync@0.4.1 will use the default script
[23:16:10] <sheetjs> https://unpkg.com/css-animation-sync@0.4.1/dist/sync.js will use /dist/sync.js from the package
[23:16:29] *** Quits: va5c0 (~vasco.nun@2001:818:e35b:6300:5ab0:35ff:fe81:99ae) (Client Quit)
[23:16:32] <sheetjs> if you omit the @0.4.1 part it will use the latest version known to unpkg

[23:17:14] <fakuve> oks sheetjs: so just `<script src="https://unpkg.com/browse/css-animation-sync"></script>
[23:17:19] <fakuve> would work
[23:17:21] <sheetjs> yeah
[23:18:08] <fakuve> Oks cheers
[23:18:14] <fakuve> Well I get now `GET https://unpkg.com/browse/css-animation-sync@0.4.1 net::ERR_ABORTED 404`
[23:18:36] <sheetjs> no browse
[23:19:31] <fakuve> Sorry what do you mean with `no browse` ?
[23:19:36] <sheetjs> look at the URL
[23:19:42] <fakuve> aa
[23:19:44] <sheetjs> https://unpkg.com/browse/css-animation-sync
[23:19:55] <sheetjs> the "browse" part tells unpkg to generate that page with the listing
[23:20:16] <sheetjs> https://unpkg.com/css-animation-sync will serve the latest version of the script (no browse, no trailing slash)
[23:20:30] <sheetjs> https://unpkg.com/browse/css-animation-sync and https://unpkg.com/css-animation-sync/ both show the package listing
[23:20:52] <fakuve> ok
[23:21:05] <sheetjs> https://unpkg.com/browse/css-animation-sync@0.4.1/dist/sync.js shows a syntax-highlighted preview while https://unpkg.com/css-animation-sync@0.4.1/dist/sync.js serves the script
[23:21:32] <fakuve> So basically ` <script src="https://unpkg.com/css-animation-sync"></script>
[23:22:24] <fakuve> I have three errors of `Uncaught ReferenceError: module is not defined` they are pointing to the library

[23:23:19] <fakuve> But it should work now thanks
[23:23:19] <Rockwood> sheetjs, o/
[23:23:58] <sheetjs> their demo uses script type="module" https://raw.githack.com/bealearts/css-animation-sync/master/example/index.html
[23:24:55] <sheetjs> fakuve: raise an issue with them, asking about a standalone script that can be added via script tag
[23:25:02] <sheetjs> because the current header does not look right
[23:25:28] <sheetjs> the default case (lines 9-13) are setting global.undefined
[23:25:47] <fakuve> Oks
[23:27:14] <fakuve> Thanks a lot sheetjs: !
