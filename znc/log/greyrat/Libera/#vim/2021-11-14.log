[12:49:12] <joo-___> if i remove the ! in front it does something

[12:49:22] <joo-___> like this: executing job failed: no such file or dir

[12:50:26] <joo-___> oh no
[12:50:49] <romainl> it's your system, you can try things before asking us, who don't know your system and have no access to it

[16:29:19] <nedbat> m_ben: the cf binding says, "make a fixup exception for the commit under the cursor." But that doesn't work for commits from :Gclog, only the commits shown in the stage/unstage window, I think?

[22:34:29] <vvdaiwrw> it's their culture, not tmux's culture.

[22:37:03] <romainl> FWIW, I've always seen macOS as two layers: the Unix stuff you use in the terminal, which indeed uses Ctrl for  everything and the GUI, which uses Cmd for everything. It has never been a problem for me (but I come from Mac 0S 7 so YMMV).
[22:38:09] <romainl> and I think it made it even easier to adapt to Vim
[22:42:12] <mehwork> I'm still not sure what's wrong with the built-in terminal vs tmux if all i'd use tmux for in this case is to split part of my screen to show a terminal
[22:42:39] <romainl> do what works for you
[22:42:41] <mehwork> the former would also work with vim running both with or without tmux
[22:43:11] <mehwork> and i can use vim's window commands that i'd already use for vim split windows without having to use a separate shortcut to jump to the terminal window
[22:43:40] <vvdaiwrw> exactly, I MA tmux power user, so I use it for much stuff beyond that. Permanent sessions, ez ssh into working sessions, etc.
[22:44:08] <vvdaiwrw> if you just care for window splits, there isn't much to it.
[22:44:23] <mehwork> i will probably  use both. I like using tmux for things like having a related local web server running in another terminal window in tmux

[22:45:45] <mehwork> romainl: yes that's what i do
[22:45:55] <romainl> no need for tmux for that
[22:46:24] <mehwork> well if it's related to the code i'm writing i like 'grouping' them into one tmux session in its own tab
[22:46:30] <mehwork> so each tab is per project
[22:46:58] <mehwork> all that stuff i have dialed. It's just using a split window for a terminal session i was on the fence about using tmux vs built-in :term
[22:47:00] <romainl> which you can do in your terminal, too
[22:47:56] <mehwork> yeah iterm2 can do that but i don't like having think about yet another way of splitting windows.  At least with tmux i get the attached session stuff and it seems more powerful
[22:48:03] <romainl> Do you need to refer to that terminal session from your Vim session? like copy/pasting some value or something?
[22:48:46] <romainl> or is it some unrelated task that you have to do from time to time?

[23:01:13] <romainl> some over-excited newcomers can say that kind of bullshit
[23:01:22] <m_ben> mehwork: while the command runs asynchronously in :term, Vim needs to allocate memory for every line that is added to the terminal buffer and this is done in the main thread (vim doesn't do multi-threading). another annoyance that you can notice in :term is that it won't rewrap the command output when you resize the window (for example if you want to make it wider)
[23:01:48] <mehwork> i've been using vim for over 10 years. I hate gui's.  But i do like this middle ground place... I'm just not a purist
[23:02:26] <mehwork> but i definitely have maps to toggle thigns like nerdtree off, because i also love viewing things full screen 90% of the time

[23:04:09] <romainl> the weird :term commands are weird, too, like for going to normal mode, and the lack of scrollback.
[23:04:13] <romainl> yuck
[23:04:31] <romainl> I would take a real terminal over that crap any day
[23:05:06] <m_ben> romainl: you can specify the size of the terminal (or scrollback) buffer
[23:05:11] <mehwork> alright i am convinced enough to not use it and will try to just stay used to using tmux for this since that's what already know how to use. Thanks
[23:05:41] <romainl> m_ben: I don't have to do that in a real terminal

[23:07:07] <romainl> I know
[23:07:13] <m_ben> in most cases that's enough

[23:08:32] <romainl> But there is no scrollback like in a real terminal. You have to change mode for that.

[23:10:12] <mehwork> i never got into vim's built-in tabs because buffers are faster, but once i got the fzf plugin I mostly use that. These little enhancements are nice even if it's a plugin
[23:11:17] <romainl> tab pages don't scale

[23:19:59] <m_ben> mehwork: nnoremap gz <cmd>tab split<cr> (mnemonic: go zoom). I use this all the time because I work with splits and often I need to "fullscreen" the current buffer. once I'm done, I run :q or :tabc and get back to the previous "viewport"

[23:25:31] <m_ben> mehwork: vim has the best window management out there, imo (idk about emacs, I think it's very similar). basically, you can edit the same buffer in multiple windows and possibly several tab pages. think of tab 1 showing interface.hpp and implementation.cpp, and tab 2 displaying interface.hpp + tests.hpp. without constantly scrolling back and forth, you can press gt or gT to jump between the two
[23:25:32] <m_ben> "viewports". if you make changes in one window, you will instantly see it in the other windows. vscode added this feature very recently, vim had it for decades!
