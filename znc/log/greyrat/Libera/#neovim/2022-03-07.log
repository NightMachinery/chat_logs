[04:33:35] <ndavd[m]> that's how my code is looking, all that's missing is the trigger functionality 
[04:35:05] <ndavd[m]> all that does is starting an infinite animation that stops once a key is pressed
[04:35:26] <seandewar[m]> yeah doing it that way works but it locks up the editor while the loop is executing
[04:35:32] <ndavd[m]> hmmm
[04:35:37] <seandewar[m]> so if there are any asynchronous events queued they won't run

[04:36:23] <seandewar[m]> your choice if its something you care about handling, though
[04:36:46] <seandewar[m]> oh, actually the sleep kinda works for running events
[04:37:11] <seandewar[m]> that might be fine enough for something simple
[04:37:26] <ndavd[m]> how could I trigger this function say after 5 seconds on hold 
[04:37:46] <seandewar[m]> so 5 seconds after the CursorHold event is fired?
[04:37:48] <ndavd[m]> bc multiple timers get initiated

[04:38:43] <ndavd[m]> (in practice it would be more like 5 min but yeah)
[04:39:19] <seandewar[m]> you'd still do it with timer_start
[04:39:30] <seandewar[m]> but youd need to make sure you stop the timer if another cursorhold event is fired

[12:23:24] <nova> 0.7.0-dev -> every (vim) function call is opening folds without reason, and it's really annoying. Am I the only one?
[12:24:24] <clason[m]> can you reproduce with `nvim --clean` (possibly followed by `-u minimal.vim` if necessary)?
[12:24:26] <nova> well, it would seem it's my config. doing :au! on all the augroups seems to "fix" the problem
[12:24:40] <clason[m]> and `0.7.0-dev` is meaningless
[12:25:03] <nova> specifically my NovaInit augroup. Let me go one by one and comment out each one...
[12:27:10] <nova> my bad for coming here. 4am, can't sleep. found the culprit though. A('CmdlineChanged', 'silent! foldopen')
[12:27:49] <clason[m]> that'll do it :)
[12:28:07] <nova> the thing is ... the command-line is not "changed" because it's not interactive at all
[12:28:44] <nova> but I think pre-lua autocmds, I had restricted it to [/?] so that it would open when searching and using ^g and ^t

[18:52:39] <dyamon> Hey all, I'm trying to `require` a lua package from a plugin like this:
[18:52:40] <dyamon> ```
[18:52:40] <dyamon> local lspconfig = require 'lspconfig'
[18:52:41] <dyamon> ```
[18:52:41] <dyamon> this works ok when in my init file, but it doesn't work when called in a file inside my own `lua/` folder.
[18:53:23] <dyamon> Is it possible to require an external lua plugin from a lua script in your lua folder?
[18:53:48] <clason[m]> sure

[18:57:12] <clason[m]> yes. that is what I'm saying
[19:01:05] <dyamon> Mmm I see, thanks a lot. I couldn't figure out why that shouldn't be the case.
[19:02:13] <dyamon> Kind of a long shot but do you have any idea of a possible cause of this?
[19:02:42] <dyamon> Or an hint on where to investigate further
[19:03:53] <clason[m]> typical cause is name collision -- the file in your own lua/ folder is also called `lspconfig.lua`?
