[07:57:00] <Ke1vin> hi i was wondering the difference between -map and -c copy
[07:57:33] <Ke1vin> i tired to extract audio losslessly
[07:58:17] <Ke1vin> but seems like -c:a:0 copy output.wav is different from -map 0:a:0 output.wav
[07:58:51] <Ke1vin> btw the origin audio format is aac
[08:00:08] <Ke1vin> also, i cannot do -ac when using -c copy, it always gives out a single channel wav
[08:00:28] <Ke1vin> meanwhile the -ac has effect when using -map
[08:00:39] <Ke1vin> the origin audio channel number is 2

[08:38:06] <Ke1vin> another|: thx, i notice this, but i'm still confusing: since `-c copy` does nothing to codec, so why the output is different from `-map`?
[08:39:20] <another|> I'm not sure I understand your question
[08:40:18] <Ke1vin> i dunno if i'm testing in the right way, what i'm doing is:
[08:41:01] <Ke1vin> ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:a:0 output1.wav
[08:41:07] <Ke1vin> ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:a copy output2.wav
[08:41:27] <another|> If no codec is explicitly given, ffmpeg autodetects it from the filename extension
[08:42:04] <Ke1vin> but i explicitly give the `copy` codec, which mean it should not doing any codec at all, right?
[08:42:17] <another|> yes
[08:42:33] <Ke1vin> btw, the origin audio format in the `input.mp4` is aac,  but what i am output is `output.wav`
[08:42:37] <another|> well, it's copying the data
[08:43:20] <Ke1vin> and you may check that result of `-map 0:a:0 output1.wav` is different from `-c:a:0 copy output2.wav`
[08:44:15] <another|> of course it is
[08:45:07] <another|> wave can contain many codecs
[08:47:04] <Ke1vin> when i check the mediainfo of `output1.wav` and `output2.wav`, i can see that: while both are `wav` format, audio format of `output1.wav` is still aac, but the audio format of `output2.wav` becomes PCM
[08:47:31] <another|> autodetection uses the filename extension to determine a container/format then selects the default audio/video/subtitle codecs for the streams
[08:47:47] <Ke1vin> another|: but `-map` is just selecting stream, and `-c copy` does nothing with codec, so they should both just copying data right?
[08:48:00] <another|> no
[08:48:40] <another|> again, if you don't provide a codec, it is autodetected
[08:49:07] <Ke1vin> `if you don't provide a codec, it is autodetected` even if i explicitly give the `copy` codec?
[08:49:17] <another|> no
[08:49:39] <another|> `copy` is a special codec
[08:50:01] <Ke1vin> yeah i know that
[08:50:17] <Ke1vin> ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:a:0 output1.wav
[08:50:21] <Ke1vin> ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:a:0 copy output2.wav

[08:51:28] <Ke1vin> i'm confused now
[08:53:13] <another|> number 1: select the first audio stream; output filename is .wav -> use the wave container; use default audio codec for wave (see `ffmpeg -h muxer=wav`)
[08:55:32] <Ke1vin> ah so i should give a `copy` codec to the `-map`? is that possible? or does that make sense?
[08:56:18] <Ke1vin> or the only right way to copy stream is to https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#Stream-copy?
[08:56:35] <another|> number 2: container is wav; only supports audio; auto select the "best" stream; for the first audio stream select stream copy
[08:59:58] <Ke1vin> `auto select the "best" stream` i didn't get that part i actually explicitly select the first audio stream, so what does this 'best' mean here?
[09:00:18] <another|> no you don't
[09:00:43] <another|> you just set the codec for the first (output?) audio stream
[09:01:14] <another|> https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-all.html#Automatic-stream-selection
[09:01:56] <Ke1vin> thx i may take a look now
[09:03:19] <another|> you mean to say you did not read the linked documentation before?
[09:04:09] <Ke1vin> yeah...sorry i didn't fully read the documentation...
[09:06:00] <Ke1vin> if i got it right... seems like the 2 lines i give out before are just not 'complete', right? i should combining them
[09:06:22] <Ke1vin> like `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:a:0 -c:a:0 copy output.wav`
[09:07:15] <Ke1vin> that's doing what i'm really intended to do: copy the first audio stream of the input file and put it into a .wav container

[18:28:00] <hendry> anyone know what the name of the library/system for encoding/decoding video in MacOS? It must have some bad bugs https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/audio-crackles-with-big-sur-11-3-1.144140/

[18:30:33] <JEEB> hendry: you mean what QuickTime utilizes underneath for example?
[18:31:20] <JEEB> at least the API that lets you access that stuff on macs is called VideoToolbox or AudioToolbox (for specifically decoding (or encoding) audio or video)
[18:31:21] <hendry> JEEB: yeah, I think it has a name
[18:32:38] <hendry> JEEB: guess Apple couldn't use ffmpeg under the hood (if it wanted to) because of GPL? Or perhaps I've misunderstand how it can be used
[18:33:00] <JEEB> they have their own stuff anyways, they put resources into either buying solutions or creating their own
[18:33:07] <JEEB> also base FFmpeg is LGPL anyways
[18:33:10] <JEEB> not GPL
[18:34:21] <JEEB> but I wouldn't be surprised if they like having their own implementations and keeping OSS away from their stack
[18:34:29] <JEEB> (not that FFmpeg's implementations are perfect, either)
[18:36:04] <hendry> well, imho ffmpeg works.
[18:36:37] <hendry> or in my experience..
[18:38:09] <JEEB> yes, I was just trying to show both sides of the coin :P
[18:38:23] <JEEB> there's stuff that's not there with FFmpeg, there's the stuff that borks with Apple's implementations

[20:11:12] <JEEB> hendry: I think coremedia wraps around them? since it defines the media pipeline used by AVFoundation
[20:11:23] <JEEB> https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremedia?language=objc
[20:11:35] <JEEB> or coremedia might be the output :P I don't know
[20:12:07] <galad> it's a lot for different frameworks, and only a bunch of them are public
[20:12:13] <JEEB> https://developer.apple.com/documentation/videotoolbox?language=objc
[20:14:36] <galad> anyway, videotoolbox and audiotoolbox are the two low level one, core media contains some common structs, core video contains the pixel buffers structs, mediatoolbox the muxer and demuxer but it's almost entirely private
[20:15:16] <JEEB> pretty much
