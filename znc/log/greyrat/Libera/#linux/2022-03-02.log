[00:53:26] <Dagmar> CaptHindsight[m]: They generally can but there's not a lot in the way of exciting "special meaning" verbiage in the GPL

[00:54:57] <Dagmar> That's a forked licence.
[00:55:10] <SaltHilStroller_> Is there a good/typical way of implementing a header struct? I.e. I have various event structs, and want to prepend each of them a header struct. I basically see 2 options: flexible-array-member, or a union. Both have drawbacks. FAM: Cannot instantiate struct on the stack. Union, overallocates memory + makes accessing internal members challenging. I'd like to do this as I need to perform an expensive function call to store the data, and I'd
[00:55:10] <SaltHilStroller_> like to avoid doing it twice to store the header then the struct
[00:55:25] <Dagmar> You can't really add a "rider" to the GPL and still call it the GPL because now it's a different licence

[01:00:23] <Dagmar> Yes.
[01:00:28] <sysRPL> does anyone here experiment with electronics?
[01:00:53] <Dagmar> Clearly they don't want blowback on them that would dilute the value of their trade name if people take the code, implement it poorly, and start making an embarassment of themselves

[01:04:59] <sysRPL> but i haven't written any code so far to conform to the usb protocol

[02:18:38] <coder7of9> i have a web control which allows a user to refresh now. this starts a process of data collection, a db update and a page refresh... usually 15 seconds. this is problematic if multiple users cick at the same time (poor design). i thought to create a flock(1) to ensire single usage of this control or to change this to a cron that runs every 5
[02:18:38] <coder7of9> minutes and eliminate the refresh now.   is there a sane way to trigger a cron job from a php or jsnode script.

[02:24:47] <coder7of9> if i am running the cron with an flock(1) i am concerned that if the script hangs the lock does not release, if i code the flock in the cron call this is difficult to manage. perhaps best to code it in a sh script and if a max time has lapsed since the  lock was aqueired i could release it and run the script.   for a script that should taje 15

[05:12:10] <coder7of9> if the cron (for example) runs every 5 minutes and for some reason does not finish the next one will skip a run and so on. so after 15 minutes (random 3 tries)  i would like to ensure the process gets killed and the lock is released

[05:14:10] <Dagmar> The good thing about file locks is that they automatically go away when the process that created them is killed

[05:14:42] <znf> ah do they now?
[05:14:44] <znf> neat
[05:14:45] <coder7of9> So a timeout will cancel the lock.  Yes i thought so

[08:21:59] <TH> I'm encountering a problem where some programs seem to get stuck on boot. When I look at them in the system activity panel in KDE Plasma, they seem to be stuck on "disk sleep." This doesn't happen to me all the time, but it happens a lot. When it does happen, reboots seem to be the only thing that fixes it. Any thoughts or ideas on how to debug this?

[10:17:08] <Gustavo6046> On a final note, there are community updates to UT99, at least since 2019, but only because of a non-disclosure agreement with Epic; only a few people have ever seen the source code to the later revisions of v469. It's good that there is community support, though. It's quite the insolent and bleak remark, though, that a community can update its own game (instead of receiving official support) through an NDA while it still remains closed source,
[10:17:09] <Gustavo6046> is already far above average for the video game industry, a place where most companies are hostile even to just community mods at all to begin with, although to varying extents, let alone community patches to the game engine itself.
[10:18:15] <Descartes> alkisg What dialog?  I am assuming you can do this with the command prompt.  But I have never done this before, so it's going to be challenging.  I usually make a lot of mistakes in the command prompt and make things worse than before.

[10:31:22] <mlu> ah, 3D gaming for blind people!
[10:31:28] <Gustavo6046> You'd have to cast rays from the player's head, in all directions, and judge distances for each ray
[10:31:31] <mlu> might be an interesting type of VR
[10:31:46] <Elw3> You are fully blind? You have a braile screen?
[10:31:46] <nickgaw> no like where you hear the monster and navigate using the errow keys tward it and shoot it.

[10:32:58] <Gustavo6046> nickgaw, I assume that means you'd need stereo audio to know where the monster was
[10:33:08] <nickgaw> Audio games do exist but none like the type I was going to create.

[10:34:20] <Gustavo6046> In a first-person shooter, the crosshair is usually at vhe very centre of the screen, and whatever you shoot at must align with it in order to be hit.
[10:34:39] <Gustavo6046> Okay, can you imagine what a rectangle or a circle look like? And do you know what a crosshair is?

[10:35:07] <mlu> or is that just to tell if your computer is on?
[10:35:10] <nickgaw> yes as audio games use a stereo field so the shooter needs to line up the monster in the center of the stereo field and usually a beeping is used to let you know you are ready to shoot.
[10:35:20] <mlu> i.e. does your desktop have a monitor that you use?

[11:05:33] <Gustavo6046> ad__, the thing is there's this stereotype that nerds or academical people like to masturbate their mind. It's not really true. Or well, it's about as true as the stereotype that left-leaning people are all transgenders who paint their hair purple and get easily offended. It's not true, and while there might be correlations they're weak and shouldn't really be used to judge a person or what they say before you get to actually know them.

[14:52:30] <Jmabsd> slight OT, trying to remember: Guys, do you remember, I think there was a project with the idea of running a small computer at home e.g. a Pi, as a kind of home server. This project is an OS distribution, i think Linux?, with the point of making deployment very easy of various services that could be useful in day to day life. I don't find that interesting but I'd like to remember the name now to be able
[14:52:37] <Jmabsd> to reference it.
[14:52:39] <Jmabsd> Any project the objective of which is to run stuff out of a home server let me know (eg photo gallery files docs etc.), open source and commercial or just an SFTP (, SMB etc.) server on Unix gives you a file server. i think there were attempts to make the process of running your own server from home, simpler.  idea: everyone has their own DIY server that they act from.

[17:26:16] <fulaphex> at this moment, it's just a point-to-point connection
[17:26:32] <fulaphex> but I thought I could have a full 192.168.6.0/24 subnet for wg
[17:26:33] <mlu> fulaphex: i.e. if you want the server to be 192.168.6.1 and the client to be 192.168.6.2, you better just use /32 subnets here and not /24
[17:27:07] <mlu> fulaphe: you could have a 192.168.6.0/24 on one of the endpoints, but the other endpoint will need a subnet or address that doesn't overlap
[17:27:08] <fulaphex> allowed ips: 192.168.6.0/24 on both sides now, still no luck

[18:53:02] <p0g0> dirtcastle, you might glance at tools like ddrescue and some of the forensic stuff, there are tools to guess partitions & formatting, and ones that try to recover data

[21:36:56] <TomyWork> jim, thanks to western shipments of (mostly) defensive weapons (anti-tank missiles and the likes), putin is having more trouble than anticipated, and almost a week later, has still not managed to capture Kyiv. Reinforcements are on the way, though, so it's probably only a matter of time. he's still pissed at the west for helping ukraine defend itself, which is why he's slightly elevated the readiness level of his
[21:36:56] <TomyWork> nuclear deterrence forces. that part is much exaggerated in western media, though, and focus should be on the people of ukraine instead, imo.

[22:30:03] <pinheadmz> exactly that is the exact problem
[22:30:04] <bingulo>  I'm trying to install grub on a LUKS2 encrypted device (full-disk, usb pendrive) and got EFI working perfectly, but not i386-pc. What I was is to use grub-mkimage with a early-grub config that load cryptography modules and run cryptomount. On the EFI case I just replace standard .EFI file, while on BIOS case I set the mkimage output to /boot/grub/i386-pc/core.img and run grub-bios-setup -d /boot/grub/i386-pc <my-device>. The
[22:30:05] <bingulo> problem on BIOS version is that it don't recognize any crypto device. If i run cryptomount -a on rescue it shows that. What should I do?

[23:22:14] <bn_work> that processes were running under that uid (100), so manually updated /etc/passwd, and tried doing a chown -R again, but it has no effect, why?  (checked /etc/shadow as well and it didn't have anything special in there)
