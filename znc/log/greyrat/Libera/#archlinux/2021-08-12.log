[01:21:02] <lucenera> When I install Arch from a USB stick the console has solid and colorful graphics. How do I get the same effect after installation? The console becomes undefined and black and white.
[01:22:43] <mpan> lucenera: “console” has no colors. Some program you use has them. If you mean your shell, see the documentation of your shell; likely you want to add some colors to the shell prompt. If some tools, they may require passing some arguments, see the relevant man pages and search for “color”. Though most programs will detect that by themselves.

[03:57:49] <chazy> switching the monitor's input*
[03:57:55] <Dragoon> you can use it for that
[03:58:06] <Dragoon> it requires you to load the i2c-dev kernel module

[04:02:21] <Dragoon> devices is a list of USB devices you want to attach at boot, and detach when you jump out of the VM with the tool
[04:02:42] <Dragoon> The device listed is an XBox Controller
[04:03:08] <Dragoon> Then the host/guest displays is an array of arguments you pass for connect and disconnect
[04:03:29] <Dragoon> it simply passes those to dcctool
[04:03:53] <Dragoon> yeah, genshin is the config for playing genshin impact, since that only works with the hypervisor bit off
[04:04:09] <Dragoon> which makes the VM _slow_, but allows the game to launch
[04:04:32] <Dragoon> It's better to just use the performant windows 10 config and enable the windows 10 hypervisor if you can
[04:05:06] <Dragoon> Which causes nested virtualization to happen, as the windows 10 hypervisor also runs the host on it
[04:05:27] <Dragoon> But for some reason that doesn't work properly for me, causes it to stutter hard

[04:37:04] <NetSysFire> if you see any use of -Sy anywhere where its not appropriate, it is encouraged to try and fix that
[04:37:08] <Dragoon> well, the real issue with using -Sy is mirrors deleting old packages
[04:37:22] <sheep> the bigger issue is causing partial upgrades
[04:37:41] <Dragoon> That's not the cause, that's the symptom
[04:37:57] <sheep> that's not caused by the old packages being deleted
[04:38:04] <Dragoon> yes it is
[04:38:11] <Namarrgon> partial updates are explicitly unsupported
[04:38:11] <Betal> Dragoon: if you -S a newer lib and broke apps, it is not old package problem
[04:38:24] <Dragoon> It's annoying to have to fetch from the arch archive just because a package is updated
[04:38:25] <sheep> no it isn't. The problem is that Arch's dependencies aren't versioned in such a way to prevent partial upgrades
[04:38:57] <Dragoon> Yes, and people do partial upgrades because they see 404s when installing packages
[04:39:09] <Dragoon> That's the one huge downside to running arch
[04:39:15] <sheep> 404s aren't the cause. The cause is using -Sy instead of -Syu
[04:39:19] <chazy> 404s are easily fixed by `pacman -Syyuu`

[04:39:44] <Dragoon> You guys are misunderstanding
[04:39:54] <thurstylark> getting 404s is a sign that it's time to -Syu
[04:40:08] <thurstylark> we understand what you're saying, we disagree with your perspective
[04:40:12] <Dragoon> And Syu almost always means a reboot
[04:40:26] <chazy> Betal: ik, but i remember reading in the wiki a long time ago that that was the correct way so it's just habit for me to use that
[04:40:26] <Dragoon> And I'm not going to reboot mid programming session
[04:40:30] <sheep> no it doesn't
[04:40:31] <NetSysFire> !404
[04:40:32] <phrik> If you get 404 errors from pacman, it's time to -Syu... no, scratch that, it's *always* time to -Syu. Never use -Sy fubar. (also see !sos)
[04:40:38] <Betal> chazy: if you make sure your mirror is updated and it have newer packages, you can even change mirrors and only use -Syu
[04:40:38] <thrice> you can sort of safely ignore kernel updates
[04:40:41] <NetSysFire> ^
[04:40:42] <sheep> the only packages you might need to reboot for are the kernel and systemd
[04:40:52] <NetSysFire> no systemd doesnt need a reboot afaik
[04:40:58] <NetSysFire> there is daemon-reexec for that
[04:41:03] <sheep> oh right
[04:41:10] <sheep> and even then you really only need to reboot for the kernel if you need to load a module that isn't loaded
[04:41:14] <kevr> hell, there's kexec for kernels!
[04:41:19] <sheep> (or fix a bug)
[04:41:19] <Dragoon> kernel, drivers, xorg
[04:41:20] <NetSysFire> e.g openssl may need one for example
[04:41:24] <Dragoon> kexec harmful
[04:41:30] <NetSysFire> xorg doesnt need a reboot either
[04:41:30] <kevr> why is that?
[04:41:40] <sheep> kexec still requires rebooting userspace
[04:41:55] <kevr> true. it's a lot quicker than a reboot though, especially with encrypted disks
[04:42:06] <Betal> Dragoon: kexec is ok, how "harmful" is that?
[04:42:10] <Dan39> i had Xorg segfault on my today actually because i switched to nvme and something was happening just too fast haha
[04:42:13] <Dragoon> By default it isn't hardened afaik
[04:42:27] <NetSysFire> there are no defaults
[04:42:27] <Dragoon> So you could load an unsigned kernel when secureboot is on
[04:42:39] <Betal> Dan39: did you reset xorg (like relogin)?
[04:42:41] <Dan39> but no one will care since i have it being started by startx in a systemd service file instead of the "proper" ways haha
[04:42:55] <thurstylark> imo, here's an appropriate use for -Sy to get around 404s: If you know that you will be able to -Syu later, and you plan on doing so as quickly as possible based on all the packages that need updating.
[04:43:03] <thurstylark> then fix the fuckups on your own
[04:43:08] <thurstylark> if you can't do that, don't -Sy
[04:43:25] <kevr> basically, if you don't know what you're doing, just use -Syu to be safe.
[04:43:29] <Dragoon> I mostly just fetch a package from the archive if I don't want to Syu
[04:43:30] <NetSysFire> you can continue to -Sy, but dont come asking for help because it broke it something
[04:43:31] <kevr> ;)
[04:43:36] <Dan39> Betal: running startx again after boot and it works fine. it only fails if attempting while i915 driver is still initializing, like the status of /sys/class/drm/card0-*/status still says "unknown" instead of "disconnected" or "connected"

[04:44:33] <phrik> The double yy in `pacman -Syyu` is almost never needed. If you're switching to a mirror that uses an older copy of the repos, see !Syyuu instead. Unless your repo databases are completely corrupted, force-downloading already-up-to-date ones accomplishes nothing other than to waste bandwidth and server load. Do your part in conserving the internet, and avoid Syyu!
[04:44:36] <thurstylark> right. It's not that it's an evil incantation that you shouldn't do ever, it's just not something that we support here, so it's not encouraged in general
[04:44:41] <kevr> ther is no problem with the former, with the latter, it is not always needed, rarely ever is

[04:55:38] <Betal> is there some example of what can go wrong using sudo su instead of sudo -i or using --login?
[04:56:09] <NetSysFire> sudo -i spawns a shell. sudo su invokes su for that

[04:56:30] <chazy> adding to that, being the only user, is there a problem with just using su instead of sudo or the like?
[04:56:34] <Dragoon> environment variables leak into the shell if you don't use -i
[04:57:11] <Dragoon> This is why you sudo -i emerge on gentoo, and not sudo emerge
[04:57:51] <Dragoon> And if you use -i to switch to another user than root, it makes sure things like tmux work correctly because it does an actual login rather than a simple user switch

[06:35:56] <alschaapman> I like the idea of a free wheeling AUR. Anybody who can be bothered to read up knows there's a lot of crap in there and that it's unwise to source PKGBUILDs without examining them
[06:36:04] <bookworm> but in this case it might've been better to add to the existing pkgbuild rather than making an -arm package
[06:36:16] <bookworm> there's nothing arm only about tor-browser

[07:49:56] <kevr> After all, systemd-boot is booting an EFI stub, which then loads into the kernel. With the `linux` package, the kernel is stored in a specific, unversioned place.
[07:50:14] <kevr> So, if you use timeshift to revert to an older kernel, it will just boot into the reverted kernel.

[19:18:24] <grazzolini> mullagain: afaik, on windows you can reload the same driver, not a new version. for a new version, you have to restart. linux usually has no need for reloading stuff, but it's doable. however, since the video driver is what you're using in the first place to see stuff, you can't reload it. however, if you had a serial console, for example, you could reload it just fine. you could even go further and load a newer version of the 
[19:18:24] <grazzolini> driver, presuming you had one built for the currently running kernel.

[19:21:15] <grazzolini> mullagain: you could still build the newer nvidia version against your current kernel.
[19:21:51] <grazzolini> mullagain: and, using bbswitch or acpi, you can power off the card, load the new module, power it on again.
