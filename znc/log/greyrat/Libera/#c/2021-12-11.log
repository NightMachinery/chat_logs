[00:00:06] <fizzie> No, it just requires function pointers to be convertible to `void *`.
[00:00:30] <constxd> how about this king
[00:00:49] <constxd> if i pass a null pointer to do_work, i want you to use fread
[00:01:16] <superstar64> hmm, i guess that could work
[00:01:44] <superstar64> can function pointers be null?
[00:01:58] <fizzie> Sure.

[00:07:39] <fizzie> C11 6.3.2.3p7: "A pointer to an object type may be converted to a pointer to a different object type. If the resulting pointer is not correctly aligned for the referenced type, the behavior is undefined."
[00:08:26] <fizzie> So hypothetically you might be able to use `_Alignas (FILE)` to ensure that your pointers can be converted to `FILE *` and back again.
[00:08:35] <fizzie> But it'd be a weird thing to do.
[00:08:49] <constxd> isn't FILE an incomplete type?
[00:09:11] <fizzie> Hmm, it might be allowed to be. (I don't think it often is though.)
[00:10:03] <fizzie> 7.21.1p2 just says "`FILE` which is an object type capable of --", so it's indeed not required to be a complete type (or incomplete either).

[07:41:37] <aighearach> But for a GUI, working with Gtk is a great pleasure when writing the code compared to the other completely portable options. Debugging requires more understanding, but that's less of a problem if you write less bugs. I've use Gtk via numerous languages over 20+ years and I've never had to make a platform-specific change. Even for things like tray apps that are often not portable. If it degraded nicely to a simpler for for embedded use, I'd use it there 
[07:41:37] <aighearach> too, but it doesn't.

[16:33:31] <pragma-> ,mallocidiom
[16:33:31] <candide> T *p = malloc(sizeof *p) is more robust than T *p = malloc(sizeof (T)) because sizeof *p will always be the correct size of T and it prevents unnecessarily repeating the T (DRY principle). If sizeof (T) is used and later one of the T's is changed there will be a mismatch. T *p = malloc(sizeof *p) is more concise and easier to read, especially when T is a compound type.

[16:36:36] <infurious> int* p = "something";
[16:37:02] <infurious> sizeof *p will return 4 bytes
[16:37:05] <infurious> which is pointer type
[16:37:19] * pragma- stares.
[16:37:52] <infurious> while sizeof p will return size of memory address which the p pointer contains- on x84- 4 byte
[16:38:24] <infurious> but actually malloc allocates 2 extra byte which store the size of allocated space used when doing free() to dealloc

[16:57:44] <darsie> like char *a,b,*c,d,e;
[16:57:48] <System_Error> actually many code writes char* something and gets away with it.
[16:58:25] <darsie> and char* a,b,c is pointer, char, char, not three pointers.
[16:59:08] <pragma-> Understanding what "declaration follows use" means will help you understand type notation as the C designers intended.
[16:59:16] <dave0> ah argument over whitespace, awesome
[16:59:31] <darsie> Am I right?
[16:59:42] <darsie> char* a,b,c is pointer, char, char, not three pointers.
[16:59:49] <pragma-> Sure, C largely ignores whitespace since it's not significant for the compiler most of the time, but the whitespace is significant for the human understanding the code.

[17:02:26] <System_Error> when it comes to understanding, some even recommend to put each var on own line. Decoding char *a,b,*c,d,e; would likely make one sometimes dereferencing something that isnt pointer, or eating pointer's value as data.
