[07:44:27] <zemzem> I didnt know muun wallet supported P2TR addresses
[07:44:34] <zemzem> glad to see wallets picking up Taproot
[07:46:12] <tusko> ;;tlast
[07:46:12] <gribble> 49249.06
[07:46:16] <tusko> I blame LN
[07:47:17] <Guest00> why LN?
[07:51:16] <deathadder> What is LN
[07:51:31] <Guest00> lightning network
[07:51:57] <deathadder> oh
[07:52:07] <deathadder> so it's like a layer 2 network
[07:52:12] <Guest00> yes
[07:52:15] <deathadder> transactions happen quickly
[07:52:18] <Guest00> yup
[07:52:19] <deathadder> then commits to bitcoin later
[07:52:25] <Guest00> exactly
[07:52:32] <deathadder> sounds parasitic
[07:52:33] <deathadder> lol
[07:52:39] <Guest00> why?
[07:52:47] <deathadder> sounds like Ubuntu and Debian
[07:52:49] <Guest00> please read mastering the lightning network free on github
[07:53:03] <deathadder> Ubuntu is "based" on Debian
[07:53:07] <Guest00> yea kind of
[07:53:17] <deathadder> more like Ubuntu takes Debians hard work and makes money out of it
[07:53:26] <deathadder> anyhow
[07:53:31] <deathadder> that's more of a #linux topic
[07:53:33] <deathadder> so yeah
[07:53:39] <Guest00> LN solves a lot of problems though
[07:53:43] <Guest00> look into it
[07:53:46] <deathadder> it's sort of like afterpay
[07:53:49] <deathadder> if you heard of it
[07:53:55] <Guest00> never did
[07:54:06] <deathadder> afterpay lets you buy stuff then pay later
[07:54:15] <zemzem> LN will solve a lot but not everything
[07:54:16] <deathadder> like a credit card but it's an app
[07:54:20] <Guest00> its not the same as that
[07:54:20] <zemzem> Still quite centralized
[07:55:05] <zemzem> Dont let people say its not bitcoin though. They love that narrative. Lightning will be very important but is not the end all be all
[07:55:07] <Guest00> you dont ever have to send the commit to the bitcoin network if you don't want to
[07:55:11] <x0> and still not private enough
[07:55:28] <zemzem> x0: what are you talking about? If anything its more private
[07:55:40] <zemzem> its not recorded on chain where you can view the transaction
[07:55:58] <zemzem> Thats a concern the govt has with LN
[07:55:59] <Guest00> unless you commit the final transaction
[07:56:05] <Guest00> but it is optional
[07:56:06] <deathadder> if I use a private key to access a ledger entry, does the wallet just try and unencrypt every public key in the ledger or the private key encodes where in the ledger it unlocks?
[07:56:12] <zemzem> Guest00: aka open/close channels
[07:56:17] <x0> the custodian ln node can harvest a ton of informations I've heard.
[07:56:20] <Guest00> yes that is what i meant
[07:56:45] <zemzem> x0: i see what you mean now, thank you for clarifying
[07:56:47] <deathadder> I don't know much about wallet implementations
[07:57:05] <zemzem> x0: apologies if i cam off rude
[07:57:35] <x0> zemzem: it's all good
[07:58:11] <zemzem> But there is a lot of money and dev time going into LN so I imagine they will come up with some clever solutions to its few issues
[08:07:36] <tusko> btc is my favorite NFT even with LN
