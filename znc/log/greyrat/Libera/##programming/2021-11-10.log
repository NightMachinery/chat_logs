[01:07:47] <flakland> one has to wonder if that overflow still exists on 64bit systems
[01:08:41] <bugweiser> I *think* that is why it has: sizeof(void*)==4
[01:09:34] <bugweiser> prior to the 2 ifs, it had this commented out part:
[01:09:37] <bugweiser> /if ((sizeof(void*)==4) && unlikely(length>LZ4_MAX_INPUT_SIZE)) goto _output_error;   /* overflow detection */
[01:10:31] <Decker> well depends on what the other things holding that value are... 
[01:10:38] <bugweiser> and LZ4_MAX_INPUT_SIZE constant was (and still is) set to 0x7e000000  (so 'arbitrary sizes' that the spec touts is actually slightly under 2 gb max
[01:10:41] <Decker> if there's ints it'll be an issue later

[01:40:42] <apotheon> . . . to whom?
[01:40:59] <dre> my naive understanding of rust is that it brings all of the niceties of static typing, dynamic langs, etc, and bring them into a compiled binary
[01:41:02] <moniker0> is ther e ahandy website about programmers who like to format the source tree and THEN undertake trivial changes and check back in after modifying 4 lines of code?

[01:41:28] <sonny> ?
[01:41:38] <apotheon> dre: That's an interesting image.
[01:41:48] <moniker0> dre: kotlin native is an llvm frontend 
[01:41:51] <flakland> so it's like a pointer to some "owner" the compiler uses and prevents any other code blocks from accessing the data on stack?

[04:45:48] <sonny> also, increase in memory size when you go to a larger register size, e.g. 32 to 64 bit
[04:46:07] <oldlaptop> sonny: Processors with N-bit registers tend to have N-bit pointers and address spaces for N>=16 or so, if that's what you mean
[04:46:25] <sonny> [itchyjunk]: sadly the copied it from the c switch for some reason

[04:46:42] <[itchyjunk]> so C switch runs all cases till it sees a return as well?

[04:48:26] <oldlaptop> Now you can't assume the virtual address space exposed to your program under a particular operating system and environment has any relationship to the virtual address space available to your program.
[04:48:46] <oldlaptop> (And that doesn't have any real relationship to how much physical memory the computer has either.)

[04:49:35] <flakland> gtk2 was aight until they broke it with updates
[04:50:05] <jinsun> [itchyjunk]: it just jumps to the label that matches the thing you are switching on and runs all lines  after that (including the one ones that look like a part of a case below)

[04:50:47] <jinsun> [itchyjunk]: to prevent running other cases you have to manually jump out with a break or return
[04:51:15] <[itchyjunk]> hmm that makes sense i think
[04:51:26] <[itchyjunk]> i had just expected it to run the case it matches and nothing else
[04:51:33] <[itchyjunk]> does py do it like java too?
[04:51:34] <tomathy> flakland: what GUI tools do you use?
[04:51:41] <[itchyjunk]> wonder if it's common thing for all languages

[04:51:49] <sonny> it's not
[04:51:54] <[itchyjunk]> oh py doesn't do it? :<
[04:52:10] <sonny> py probably does what you are thinking
[04:52:16] <[itchyjunk]> ah
[04:52:29] <[itchyjunk]> case 'apple': only runs things inside the apple case
[04:52:35] <[itchyjunk]> i suppose
[04:52:37] <tomathy> do you recommend it flakland 
[04:52:39] <[itchyjunk]> hmm interesting
[04:53:02] <flakland> only if you're not afraid to read your own input devices
[04:53:58] <tomathy> is wiring the gui to the program always difficult?
[04:54:31] <tomathy> i never got my head around it

[07:32:47] <Stryyker> What is wrong with vector?
[07:32:51] <oldlaptop> in any case, if the compiler can prove neither side of the && has side effects, it's none of your business which order it decides to evaluate them in
[07:33:06] <Gamah> if(value==failCondition && othervalue.back() ==passcondition) is better than having them swapped around &&?
[07:33:30] <Stryyker> if you have one that is more likely to fail, probably put that first
[07:33:42] <oldlaptop> Stryyker: nothing, but I'd guess offhand that a struct/class member access is a bit faster than an element access to a vector

[07:35:19] <Stryyker> I don't know what you actually have, hard to comment
[07:35:31] <Gamah> oh well.... it's not python anymore... so i'll just accept that code go brrr and deal with optimization after i have results...

[07:37:38] <oldlaptop> Reasoning about this kind of low-level performance question is in practice very hard, especially on modern machines, which is why (a) there's an optimizing compiler to do a lot of that kind of thing for you, and (b) you use empirical profiler data to guide your decisions
[07:38:18] <Gamah> i guess i ought to educate myself more about what kind of optimizations modern compilers do
[07:38:38] <Gamah> most of my knowledge is based on interpreted langs.
[07:39:14] <oldlaptop> your job for the moment is more to choose good algorithms and so forth - using an n^2 algorithm where you could find an n*lg(n) algorithm instead is generally going to overwhelm micro-optimizations

[07:41:04] <oldlaptop> once you have something that works, you can start to think about where there might be inefficiencies, and start asking a profiler about them.
[07:41:05] <Gamah> correctly totaling a blackjack hand based on it's previous hard/soft state and the value of a new card is proving to be an annoying algorighm to solve....
[07:41:44] <Gamah> oldlaptop: i did that in python and it was array access that was killing me by a longshot so reimplementing from scratch in c++ has me afraid to even touch iterators.

[12:53:41] <feep[work]> hi
[12:54:11] <feep[work]> I ran into an issue with json-rpc where the fact that we had server notifications over a single connection, but also client requests and responses, meant that we were unable to provide backpressure on notifications
[12:54:24] <feep[work]> my question is: what's the *name* for that problem?
[12:54:45] *** Quits: dan01 (~dan01@88.84.165.182) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:54:52] <feep[work]> it sort of looks like the reverse of head-of-line blocking, ie. the fact that we have a long-running *asynchronous* request means we have to buffer an unlimited number of unrelated messages.
[12:58:25] <Samian> Does this make sense to you? "Cache generation occurs the first time --use-persistent-cache is enabled with a given config.  The speedup is observed during subsequent runs."   Is there anything you'd write differently? The "speedup is observed" part sounds a little weird.

[13:09:48] <feep[work]> Square: well, the point is, the client has no way to prioritize anything
[13:09:53] <feep[work]> it can't say no
[13:11:22] <Square> ok, so a normal synchronous client request could be answered by a "server notification"  
[13:11:26] <feep[work]> nono
[13:11:39] <feep[work]> notifications are asynchronous; the server can send them at any time for any reason
[13:11:44] <feep[work]> subscription is a request, it has a normal response
[13:11:52] <feep[work]> it just triggers the server to start sending (flooding) notifications

[13:15:18] <flakland> why does th e RPC take so long that it blocks out notifications
[13:15:26] <feep[work]> it's not a question of length
[13:15:40] <feep[work]> or rather, the problem isn't that the rpc take long, the problem is that notification sending is faster than processing at all.
[13:15:42] <flakland> its  a high notification protocol?

[13:16:39] <flakland> then don't fix it
[13:16:50] <feep[work]> the problem is that the client has no way to mitigate the spam.
[13:17:03] <flakland> mitigate normal operation?
[13:17:06] <feep[work]> I mean, by the same logic http downloads are spammy.
[13:17:13] <feep[work]> the server sends as fast as it can.

[13:20:45] <feep[work]> http/3 definitely doesn't, because they use separate queues (<3)
[13:20:49] <flakland> this isn't on TCP?
[13:21:00] <feep[work]> it's on tcp, but tcp *as a protocol in itself* doesn't have the issue
[13:21:16] <feep[work]> tcp is a message dialog. jsonrpc is a message dialog on top of it.
[13:21:21] <flakland> it does if you design your application poorly
[13:22:04] <feep[work]> the tcp packet semantics don't have the issue, because the client can refuse to acknowledge a packet.
[13:22:16] <feep[work]> this is not an application issue.
[13:22:25] <feep[work]> it's a foundational issue with jsonrpc.

[15:24:26] <Decker> about99% of the cases
[15:24:34] <Decker> of infix operations
[15:26:10] <vdamewood> user51: It translates infix to a stack. So, as long as everything is binary infix.
[15:26:36] <vdamewood> ... but if you want to use something else, like prefix function calls, you're screwed.
[15:27:15] <Decker> I dunno you could probably just put a sort of delay-filter in there that can de-prefix things
[15:27:17] <user51> i hacked a postfix operator in, now trying unary minus
[15:27:26] <GeDaMo> I think it can deal with prefix too
[15:28:01] <Decker> I just know every time it was suggested it aplied to a syntax that was infix...
[15:28:39] <GeDaMo> There's an example on Wikipedia (scroll down a bit) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm#Detailed_example
[15:28:41] <bayaz> Title: Shunting-yard algorithm - Wikipedia 
[15:28:42] <vdamewood> I wrote a recursive-descent parser for infix twice.

[16:29:39] <carldev31> make sense to actually recreate the whole envrionment on every master push with ansible via ci/cd? Im not sure how to integrate these two workflows.

[17:05:43] <Twix> you need a asymmetric cryptosystem, francogrex. PGP Works quite well. A alternative if you want to build your own stuff around some library would be nacl/libsodium, which uses Curve25519 for signing and encryption.

[17:09:05] <Twix> an signature is basically a hash of the document and then cryptographic magic using a asymmetric cipher.
[17:09:26] <Twix> In asymmetric cipher suites, you have two keys. One private and one public
[17:09:41] <Twix> the private one is kept secret and the public one is made public

[17:10:09] <Twix> you need the private key to create a signature and the public one to check if the signature is legit
[17:10:17] <francogrex> ok
[17:10:32] <Twix> pgp/opengpg is a ready to use system
[17:11:59] <Twix> nacl/libsodium is a simpler and more modern system, intended for use in your own software. But you can also use opengpg in your software, but the interfaces to nacl are simpler
[17:12:00] <francogrex> ok and just for completing my understanding: it allows two people to co-sign the same document? 
[17:12:10] <Twix> you can just create two signature
[17:12:36] <Twix> or as much as you like
[17:12:54] <francogrex> and is there a way to hold the party who signed responsible if at a certain point during a litigation she/he may deny ever signing off?
[17:13:29] <francogrex> or does that require an overseeing third party?
[17:13:42] <Twix> only the private key can create a signature
[17:13:51] <Twix> to a public key
[17:14:21] <Twix> but a party could "accidentially" loose their private key and make it public

[19:42:23] <pulse> I'll go live in maybe a week, two tops
[19:42:39] <pyzozord> nice!
[19:42:42] <pyzozord> classy
[19:42:48] <pulse> Thoughts/opinions appreciated, also if you want to jump onboard as a mod I'd love to have you
[19:42:50] <pulse> No pressure though
[19:42:51] <pyzozord> oh wow, so quick?
[19:42:52] <pulse> Totally up to you
[19:43:02] <pulse> Yeah, I already got the domain set up, just need to figure out
[19:43:14] <pulse> I spent all night yesterday fixing various phpBB theme bugs
[19:43:15] <pyzozord> totally can jump on
[19:43:32] <pulse> It's almost workable now but I have work related stuff do attend to now
[19:43:38] <pulse> Cool
[19:44:11] <pyzozord> hah yes pesky work distracting us from the real projects :D
[19:44:17] <pulse> :P
[19:44:25] <pulse> I'm gonna make internet great again
[19:44:27] <pulse> With phpBB

[19:44:37] <pyzozord> heheh
[19:44:44] <pulse> Also I've registered #indiedevs which will be the IRC side of it

[19:46:08] *** Joins: JanC (~janc@user/janc)
[19:46:11] <pyzozord> I have two pieces of criticism if you are interested

[19:46:25] <bayaz> Title: Edit fiddle - JSFiddle - Code Playground 
[19:46:59] <pyzozord> 1) it's completly personal, but I'd love a dark theme
[19:47:44] <pyzozord> 2) I'd get programming into it's own category and give it topics, since I think that's what we usually focus on
[19:48:48] <pyzozord> I still love the theme it's very neat
[19:48:53] <pulse> Yeah for 1. basically I want some kind of identity so this will be the default. But phpBB supports custom themes per user so technically someone could turn this theme into a dark one and then every user could just select. But there's usability problems with it. I'd personally prefer light mode only but I get that some people are all about darkmode
[19:49:06] <pulse> For 2, yeah. Maybe. Subforums are a thing too so Programming could have a bunch of them
[19:49:08] <pyzozord> you know what actually disregard 1) I can use Dark Reader chrome extension
[19:49:25] <pulse> But I don't want to completely oversaturate with sub-boards because idk if it will take off or not
[19:49:33] <pulse> Thanks for input though

[19:49:51] <pulse> The plan is to get something workable live, and then it can evolve over time
[19:50:01] <pulse> From my experience forums rarely stay exactly the same over the course of years
[19:50:04] *** Quits: amigojapan (uid86330@id-86330.helmsley.irccloud.com) ()
[19:51:03] <pyzozord> my point about 2) was to kind of signal "hey, we are all about programming here, we do other stuff too of course, but only after we did all programming"
[19:51:16] <pyzozord> but that might be not your target
[19:51:21] <pulse> Hehe
[19:51:26] <pulse> That's why it's the 1st :D
[19:51:38] <pulse> Yeah I want a broad creative board
[19:51:53] <pulse> I could do a separate category for programming but idk if it's worth it
[19:52:00] <pulse> I expect the community will be rather tight at the beginning
[19:52:22] <pyzozord> In collabs you can probably add gamejams, those seem popular these days
[19:52:29] <pulse> But the thing is, TIGSource is showing signs of dying so if a chunk of those users come, then it will be a really cozy place
[19:52:38] <pulse> pyzozord, Yeah those should be under Events I think
[19:52:43] <pulse> I should add a bunch of descriptions
[19:52:56] <pyzozord> oh right
[19:52:58] <pulse> Anyway this is just a first draft, far from finalized

[19:53:17] <pyzozord> I think I'd maybe then display subforums on this main home page
[19:53:31] <pyzozord> unless there is going to be so many that it will be really overwhelming
[19:53:43] <pyzozord> but i'd like to be 1 click away from the forum I want
[19:53:57] <pulse> From my community building experience it's best to go small
[19:54:02] <pulse> Even this many forums idk if it's a good idea
[19:54:10] <pulse> It's a bit of a catch22
[19:54:21] <pulse> You need content, but you need users to generate content, but you don't have users until you have content
[19:54:44] <pyzozord> I'm just going to totally off of my personal preferences and just stream of conciouseness atm
[19:55:58] <pyzozord> I have to say I'm looking forward to getting on board, it would be awesome to have some async discussion place
[19:56:11] <pyzozord> hopefully other folks from here will jump on too
[19:56:33] <pyzozord> this would perfectly compliment #programming
[19:56:38] <pulse> I'm mainly hoping the TIGSource crowd finds it xD

[19:56:40] <pyzozord> ##
[19:56:48] <pulse> But I don't want to advertise it, it's unnatural
[19:56:52] <[itchyjunk]> traditionally, you start with as few as possible subforms
[19:56:53] <pulse> Word of mouth is the way to go
[19:57:00] <[itchyjunk]> and as the context grows, manually move 
[19:57:05] <pulse> [itchyjunk], Yeah but that approach can backfire too
[19:57:08] <[itchyjunk]> it's a bit more work in management size
[19:57:12] <pulse> I have experience with that
[19:57:18] <[itchyjunk]> but it improved user interactions
[19:57:35] <pulse> You can have a small forum and it's not organized enough, and then a lot of people join and you have to then manually separate content
[19:57:37] <pulse> And it's painful
[19:57:44] <pyzozord> wow they have quite a few posts there on tig
[19:57:46] <pulse> Needs a balance
[19:57:52] <[itchyjunk]> only till you have a few users
[19:57:57] <pulse> pyzozord, Yeah it's a large community. But it's dying because admin drama
[19:58:05] <pulse> It used to have 100s of active users, now it has 1-10 active users
[19:58:08] <[itchyjunk]> if your active user count is below a few dozen, it hardly matters.
[19:58:15] <pulse> So it's the best possible time to make a new community
[19:58:26] <pulse> [itchyjunk], Yeah I agree. We'll see how it goes
[19:58:55] <[itchyjunk]> from what i remember, there are way to move the posts and such via the admin tools in the softwares (i used) at least
[19:59:09] <[itchyjunk]> so i used to see what topics picked up more users and seperated that
[19:59:17] <[itchyjunk]> 10 mins wasted but worked out nice
[19:59:34] <davve> so there is this quote about functions about how its better to have a lot of them that work on the same type rather than a lot of different ones, does anyone know who/what im thinking of?
[19:59:57] <davve> some smart computer guy said it and i want to quote him ^^
[19:59:59] <[itchyjunk]> not me

[20:04:07] <pyzozord> true, I also learned from watching people like Jon Blow and Casey Muratori that game devs also like to _write_ tools
[20:04:14] <pulse> Yep
[20:04:22] <pyzozord> like they write debug tools which was a shock to me
[20:04:32] <pulse> Why was that shocking
[20:04:39] <pulse> It's common to write graphics related tools
[20:04:43] <pulse> Like sprite tester etc.

[20:05:41] <pulse> It's a way to put all assets into a bunch of datafiles and then easily extract them ingame
[20:06:16] <GeDaMo> It's a C macro which allows you to edit constants in the source while the program is running

[20:32:38] <norias> i learned C++98 around 2000
[20:33:02] <edgar-rft> already 2 years too late :-)
[20:33:03] <pyzozord> it's honestly fairly easy to sustain oneself on dignified level
[20:33:06] <dodo> web is just another interface

[20:34:13] <norias> embedded looks like it pays well
[20:34:15] <[itchyjunk]> for the more experienced coders out there
[20:34:25] <[itchyjunk]> say you wanted to learn godot scripting language and you've never used it.
[20:34:30] <edgar-rft> web dev seems easy if you're a spider
[20:34:32] <InPhase> norias: I learned C++ back when they were still debating whether or not to include the STL as a standard library when they standardize the language.  I recall it changing pretty significantly twice.  :)
[20:34:32] <[itchyjunk]> How long do you think because you can do basic stuff?
[20:34:39] <pulse> [itchyjunk], Functionally, 1-2 weeks tops. As long as it's not a completely different paradigm to what you already know

[20:35:27] <dodo> [itchyjunk]: does that include learning the ecosystem?

[20:35:28] <norias> InPhase: yeah. borland was my first compiler. 
[20:35:30] <[itchyjunk]> starting from your end
[20:35:35] <[itchyjunk]> dodo, idk what that even means
[20:35:44] <[itchyjunk]> like learning js includes node.js things?
[20:35:46] <[itchyjunk]> then no
[20:35:49] <[itchyjunk]> just the language
[20:35:52] <pyzozord> nice, I think mine too, but it was Borland Delphi 7
[20:36:26] <pyzozord> in some way I'm kind of proud that "I go so far back I know languages that are dead now"
[20:36:28] <dodo> well, with just the language you can hardly create any projects
[20:36:29] <norias> borland C++ on maybe win95?
[20:36:37] <pyzozord> although I don't really remember anything about Delphi syntax
[20:36:59] <[itchyjunk]> what? most things in py and haskell i did didn't have any additional package
[20:37:17] <dodo> python has a huge lib included
[20:37:21] <[itchyjunk]> i doubt every js coder is using some fancy library
[20:37:33] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: depending on what you mean by learn, ranging from 30 minutes to maybe a month :)

[20:37:47] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, being able to do small projects!
[20:37:54] <[itchyjunk]> pulse, lol
[20:37:58] <dodo> some of us actively avoid js :)
[20:38:09] <pulse> Some of us earn our living with JS so we can't avoid it :P
[20:38:16] <deniska> [itchyjunk]: it's harder to create a project from scratch than to make sniper edits to someone else's code :)
[20:38:17] <dodo> i feel that
[20:38:22] <[itchyjunk]> earn living strictly as a js coder?
[20:38:33] <pyzozord> hah, i'm one of the ones who can't avoid js
[20:38:52] <[itchyjunk]> deniska, just curious as to how quickly people pick up new languages
[20:38:57] <deniska> I kinda like JS, in the same way I like strong beers, but still
[20:39:11] <[itchyjunk]> fucks you up quicker?
[20:39:15] <pulse> I like JS, but I don't like how vague the codebase turns out
[20:39:18] <norias> i'm surprised web stuff pays well
[20:39:21] <dodo> [itchyjunk]: i mean, once you know a few languages.. there's basically only some syntax to learn
[20:39:32] <pulse> C++ has a very stable feeling, JS has a very flimsy feeling
[20:39:37] <deniska> it's bad for your body, honestly doesn't even taste that good, but oh boy sometimes it feels like using some JS is a great idea :)
[20:39:43] <[itchyjunk]> dodo, like java to godot scripting, how transferable is that skill?
[20:39:44] <pikapika> Theres a difference between learning a language and "writing C in any language"
[20:39:45] <dodo> so you could "learn" it in five minutes if you keep a cheatsheet around
[20:39:47] <[itchyjunk]> hypothetically speaking
[20:39:47] <pulse> But it's hard to find good paying C++ jobs, meanwhile JS jobs literally randomly hit you in the head
[20:39:49] <pyzozord> I'm looking forward to break out to some more "serious programming" field though to be honest
[20:40:08] <pyzozord> something that will be more challanging. Maybe back to web backend, although not sure about that

[20:42:07] <norias> pulse: ahh. i'm not working in the field right now, just finishing school
[20:42:18] <pyzozord> I think js pays well because it's the language for web interfaces. And web is the most accessible platform for software distribution
[20:42:29] <pulse> [itchyjunk], It's an umbrella term so it could be interpreted in various ways, but yes, normally embedded = microcontrollers
[20:42:30] <norias> pulse: but i search for jobs i find interesting
[20:42:38] <pyzozord> so access to lots of people, lots of people don't know how to use software, so they need nice buttons

[20:43:34] <pulse> You can technically do web projects in C++, at least backend
[20:43:40] <norias> dodo: i wouldn't mind that
[20:43:47] <pulse> Well, with emscripten you can do frontends too, but it's weird
[20:44:05] <norias> dodo: i dunno why. i have an irrational dislike of web stuff
[20:44:11] <pulse> But a C++ backend will take you 5000 lines of code for something that you can do in 10 lines with node
[20:45:15] <pyzozord> js is much easier to learn, so there is bigger talent pool
[20:45:55] <pyzozord> yet the demand on software still outpaces the other thing

[21:09:49] <[itchyjunk]> right?
[21:09:54] <Decker> yes
[21:09:57] <[itchyjunk]> and CUDA also talks to device driver?

[21:10:06] <[itchyjunk]> oh okay

[21:12:33] <Decker> it's not 'a' language
[21:12:34] <GeDaMo> asm tends to be much closer to machine code than languages like C
[21:13:04] <[itchyjunk]> so CUDA lets users to talk to GPU registers and such directly?
[21:13:17] <norias> my understanding is that's why you need nvcc instead of gcc
[21:13:21] <Decker> well cuda borrows from glsl so the code you write is more C like
[21:13:21] <[itchyjunk]> sounds like a rough way to work with GPU's

[22:17:02] <sonny> lobste.rs is made in rails
[22:17:09] <apotheon> pulse: Ruby is actually still in heavy use.
[22:17:12] <Gamah> previously i was comparing the total of the 2nd card added to the iterator and if it matched the value of the hand already, i'd set a bool to true for "isPair" this left the 6,6 vs A,A problem of both being pairs and a value of 12.... but then it hit me, just make isPair an int and use the value of the card as the value of the pair...
[22:17:19] <pulse> apotheon, Interesting
[22:17:19] <Gamah> ruby is all over 
[22:17:41] <apotheon> The hype phase is over, though.
[22:18:29] <apotheon> JavaScript fads have eaten into its popularity, though, so it's not quite what it was at its peak, as far as I'm aware.
[22:18:49] <apotheon> I think JavaScript has managed to eat into the popularity of almost everything, though.

[22:19:34] <sonny> I'm curious, why does language popularity matter? So people can get free open source libraries made for them?
[22:19:42] <[itchyjunk]> so 4 hour commute for my java clcass sessm like a waste of time

[22:20:00] <pulse> A language without a flourishing ecosystem loses usefulness over time
[22:20:06] <sonny> pulse: yeah, that's what I am thinking about
[22:20:21] <furrykef> Gamah: It's basically a blackjack variant, or more precisely, blackjack and pontoon appear to be siblings
[22:20:27] <apotheon> sonny: because of an instinctive desire to be "on the winning team".
[22:20:33] <apotheon> s/.$//

[22:23:11] <apotheon> if you're a good programmer
[22:23:12] <Gamah> this is probably an unpopular opinion... but i'd pick someone who knows only one language and is able to demonstrate strong critical thinking skills for a project in a language they've never touched vs someone who claims to know all the popular languages and can ace typical algorithm interview questions.
[22:23:16] <furrykef> Gamah: It could be if the odds are chosen poorly. Single-deck blackjack's house edge is actually much smaller than casinos intended when played just with basic strategy.

[22:23:59] <sonny> there are only a few languages that will require mastery or in depth knowledge, which is mostly c++
[22:24:04] <Gamah> furrykef: if they shuffle every hand, single deck is only beatable if there's at least 1 other player, and you are second, and the margin of that is not very high... finding a single deck game that deals 4-5 rounds is much more profitable
[22:24:04] <pulse> apotheon, Hmm
[22:24:23] <apotheon> pulse: . . . and people are eager to predict the "next big language"
[22:24:48] <apotheon> C++ might actually be on its way to replacement, though.

[22:24:54] <pulse> apotheon, Lol. No
[22:25:01] <pulse> Both C and C++ are here to stay
[22:25:03] <Gamah> apotheon: my favorite lang of 2018 was fortran 2015
[22:25:16] <furrykef> Rust is the only language I've seen lately that truly brings something new to the table
[22:25:22] <apotheon> Most static languages lately are partial replacements for C++.  If this keeps up, we'll see some that are effectively full replacements.
[22:25:30] <furrykef> Everything else seems to be a rehash of other languages
[22:25:31] <sonny> furrykef: what was the interoperability point?
[22:25:38] <apotheon> C itself would be more difficult to replace, given the way people think about language design.
[22:25:38] <Gamah> rust doesn't do anything new, it just does it semantically more cleanly
[22:26:00] <sonny> sometimes, you need new culture, engineering, which is how google got go

[22:26:59] <paku> shooting your own foot is C's feature
[22:27:04] <apotheon> nope
[22:27:10] <pulse> Sometimes you shoot other people's foots with C
[22:27:17] <furrykef> My choices are to use the old bindings, spend months updating the bindings, or use a different language
[22:27:24] <apotheon> You can do that in any language, though C's approach to helping you shoot yourself in the foot is certainly colorful.
[22:27:32] <furrykef> (Or spend even more months writing completely new bindings)
[22:27:41] <pulse> CSS on the other hand is just a shotgun with a comically bent barrel aimed straight at your feet
[22:27:43] <sonny> furrykef: I don't think that's related to a language wanting to be popular?
[22:27:50] <paku> idk I forgot the number of times i tried to "learn" C
[22:27:55] <Gamah> paku: I thought C's feature was aiming for your foot and then underflowing to your other foot...
[22:27:56] <sonny> well, i phrased that wrong
[22:27:57] <edgar-rft> C is a language for multi-feet people
[22:28:02] <paku> I still fear C
[22:28:08] <furrykef> sonny: As I said, unpopular languages are much more likely to have outdated bindings, because there are fewer people around to maintain them
[22:28:17] <sonny> ok
[22:28:23] <furrykef> This is not just hypothetical, I've run into exactly this sort of problem
[22:28:25] <sonny> makes sense
[22:28:28] <apotheon> C++ makes it impossible to shoot yourself in the foot by ensuring that every time you aim it at your foot it vaporizes your whole leg.
[22:28:34] <apotheon> no foot, no problem
[22:28:48] <Gamah> apotheon: can confirm.... tried to cout a bool in my app and got 47
[22:28:56] <pulse> C is a bit like historic piracy. It's loud, requires barrels of rum to maintain the crew, and it can be very fun, but on the other hand you might die of scurvy and/or be sentenced to death by the imperial soldiers

[22:30:32] <norias> i think it was in java
[22:30:33] <oldlaptop> C by definition does not do anything that's particularly new.
[22:30:40] <apotheon> K&R is pretty clear, but it expects the reader to absorb the point by osmosis, unfortunately, which doesn't work for many people.
[22:30:41] <norias> i remember thinking... i've painted myself in to a corner
[22:30:45] <sonny> rust has a new concept called borrow checking etc
[22:30:47] <norias> then went... goto !
[22:31:04] <furrykef> sonny: That's literally what we're discussing right now.
[22:31:08] <oldlaptop> (well, maybe not *strictly* by definition. The most recent significant spec revision was only around ten years ago.)
[22:31:31] <sonny> I was replying to "so rust nor c does anything interesting"
[22:31:35] <Gamah> my git log trying to figure out how headers work in c++ "add headers; fix headers; okay how do headers work; okay i'm bad at this; remove namespaces; hello darkness my old friend; correctly implement headers; okay actualy corretly implement headers; okay i think the headers are working now"
[22:31:36] <oldlaptop> Its fundamental concepts can't possibly be very "new" by computing-industry standards, because it and its fundamental concepts date to the 1970s.
[22:31:53] <oldlaptop> (or earlier, of course, for the concepts that weren't original in the 1970s)
[22:32:03] <apotheon> sonny: Someoen already brought up borrow checking as an answer to that, though.

[22:32:19] <apotheon> yep

[22:34:23] <Gamah> oldlaptop: i feel like i was trying to make the same point
[22:34:36] <Gamah> i wasn't aware of rust doing anything particularly novel.... 
[22:34:47] <sonny> the example for c is more appropriate given algol
[22:34:49] <Gamah> i remember when it was much newer everyone was like "it has immutability by default and that's good!"
[22:35:13] <oldlaptop> just because the same thing could be accomplished less cleanly or without as many safety checks with bar doesn't mean foo is uninteresting or useless or unoriginal
[22:35:14] <Gamah> but nothing has ever stopped us from implementing immutable variables in other langs... i dunno

[22:36:22] <Gamah> i get the sentiment behind it
[22:36:29] <oldlaptop> I can't comment offhand on how original rust's distinctive features are to it - there's prior art for a lot of things, especially in toy research languages.
[22:36:34] <Gamah> it added a lot of tedium imo tho sonny 
[22:36:36] <sonny> what is it?
[22:36:54] <Gamah> rusts immutability
[22:37:09] <oldlaptop> It *is* breaking ground in the sense of getting some of those features into classes of programs that didn't use them before.
[22:37:10] <sonny> rust prior art is from 2003-06, but it did not make it out of acadamia
[22:37:27] <sonny> what is the sentiment?
[22:37:37] <Gamah> that immutability makes safer code
[22:37:45] <Gamah> especially if it's the compiler enforcing it
[22:37:53] <oldlaptop> (You might as well argue - technically correctly - that there was nothing particularly original or interesting about, say, the Ford Model T, but you would be delusional to claim on that basis that it wasn't important)

[22:38:54] <oldlaptop> I believe they've written various important chunks of it in rust, largely associated with the rendering engine.
[22:39:13] <Gamah> i remember an article from like 2016 showing some basic rendering stuff and the gains it had
[22:39:19] <paku> still can't beat chromium 🤡
[22:39:27] <oldlaptop> (To be clear, I don't use rust, and am not particularly interested in it - in large part because I hate package managers of cargo's tribe with the burning fire of a thousand suns.)
[22:39:28] <Gamah> but it was also being compared to the full fledged renderer... so of course it was going to be faster lol
[22:39:44] <lantech19446> I was studying webdev for the last several months but now I feel like my opportunities to get into that industry aren't great and I'm thinking that maybe programming would be a better route. I know I need to build a portfolio, I know I should contribute to open source projects and get a few commits under my belt before I start applying to jobs so that I have something to show for my skills. I
[22:39:45] <sonny> oldlaptop: why's that?
[22:39:46] <lantech19446> also understand that hello world and other school assignments are a dime a dozen and not portfolio quality coding so I know this will take time, I'm not looking for a job tomorrow. My ideal timeline is about a year to a year and a half. My question is should I continue on my path to learn javascript or is python a better choice?
[22:40:01] <sonny> language devs don't trust distros or the OS
[22:40:03] <Gamah> oldlaptop: i was specifically avoiding bringing cargo into it because it didn't feel fair.
[22:40:27] <Decker> how do you excluse the standard package library from the language? not fair?
[22:41:09] <oldlaptop> sonny: Partly because I don't want random things downloading random crap from the Internet behind my back during the build process whenever they feel like it, and partly because I trust "distros or the OS" to get packaging right much more than I trust Joe Sixpack who just uploaded some random thing to pypi, or crates.io, or whatever the hell it is
[22:41:21] <Gamah> lantech19446: i started as a SQL developer with less than 1000 lines of code of portfolio and less than a year of exposure to databases... got in through a contracting gig, maybe give that a shot to build the portfolio
[22:41:22] <apotheon> lantech19446: If you're new to coding, try to stick to a single language for a couple years.
[22:41:29] <apotheon> lantech19446: You need time to learn a little depth.
[22:41:34] <sonny> yeah that's a good analysis 
[22:41:59] <apotheon> lantech19446: Sticking to that is more important than specific language choice, at least within the pool of generally acceptable languages in widespread use.
[22:42:09] <Gamah> oldlaptop: speaking of cargo... is there any offline way to include all your own libs from disk and tell it to fuck off about talking to the internet?
[22:42:11] <lantech19446> Gamah: so you were doing like back end dev type stuff?
[22:42:14] <apotheon> Note that picking PHP as your first is somewhat limiting.
[22:42:19] <oldlaptop> and if I'm going outside the OS's package manager (I understand windows and macOS people don't have OS package managers worth two excretions, and that's too bad for them), I want to know and control what the hell is going on.
[22:42:23] <sonny> lantech19446: the advice here is usally to build something, open source is a lot of work
[22:42:39] <Gamah> lantech19446: i accidentally fell into full stack VB6/SQL server/ASP (not .net) stuff at a company where i was originally hired as a forklift driver
[22:42:53] <lantech19446> apotheon: ok what you're saying makes sense. I guess I just don't know what language would be better for a noob 
[22:43:08] <sonny> js?
[22:43:09] <apotheon> JavaScript is fine.
[22:43:11] <Decker> tS
[22:43:15] <oldlaptop> Gamah: I would assume so, and would also assume it's not particularly easy. I think the last cargo enthusiast I asked about this was maintaining some kind of private mirror of all the crate stuff.
[22:43:20] <Gamah> nobody's going to agree with me, but the language won't matter if you're actually driven to learn and solve problems
[22:43:24] <apotheon> If you're already working with it, and don't hate it, you might as well stick with it.
[22:43:25] <lantech19446> damn Gamah that's some fortunate falling
[22:43:42] <apotheon> I mean, JavaScript has its negatives, and I personally loathe those negatives, but that's beside the point.
[22:43:51] <apotheon> Find me a language without negatives.
[22:43:57] <lantech19446> apotheon: I'm not working with it yet I just have a class lined up on udemy for it but i can just as easily find classes in any other language I have a personal subscription
[22:43:58] <Gamah> sql :D
[22:44:07] <oldlaptop> Gamah: The wrong language for the job can make getting the work done much more irritating, and thereby burn out that "[drive] to learn and solve problems" faster
[22:44:35] <sonny> languages are made to solve problems, well the best ones anyways

[22:58:28] <apotheon> lantech19446: JavaScript is usable for both front-end and back-end coding for web applications, but writing local system tools is a bit less ideal.

[22:58:39] <Guest28> perfect thank you that was very easy to understand
[22:58:41] <Fault> A race condition is exactly that: multiple pieces of code are racing to access or modify data. Only one will win, but which wins is nondeterministic (usually) and that’s Bad ™️
[22:58:41] <sonny> lol
[22:58:56] <apotheon> lantech19446: . . . so pick something that aims in the direction of work you want.
[22:59:00] <derjanni> I would like to share my scientific observations on noobs. My findings are that I have found 2 different species of noobs: A) the instructed noob that only performs tasks with a computer that he/she is instructed to B) the insane dunning-kruger-early-stage noob that uses a computer up to complete insanity and configures the machine in a way that makes it inoperable and perform absolute nonsense.

[22:59:28] <apotheon> norias: Businesses treat them differently as new hires than others.
[22:59:39] <Gamah> no idea what allstar is, but python can probably do this with a lot of exising libraries
[22:59:47] <norias> apotheon: how so ( as someone in college this seems very relevant )
[23:00:05] <lantech19446> allstar is an amateur radio service that uses repeaters connected to the internet to talk all over the world
[23:00:25] <Gamah> sonny: undefined, you're right... the brother could end up shitting on the other bother instead of the floor.... i'm definitely stealing this.

[23:27:37] <stoned> Why?
[23:27:38] <apotheon> The missus has to deal with the paucity of good tooling around that stuff all the time.
[23:27:42] <arahael> there are plenty of source control options with CI integration and all that...  but with DBMS dev it's a very different situation.

[23:29:55] <arahael> Gamah: i'm sure they do,  but somehow in my experience postgres and sqlite are much much simpler.
[23:30:00] <oldlaptop> apotheon: Oh, now you've gone and done it. MSSQL's "management studio" thing has a genetic relationship to visual studio, so some visual studio fan is going to come here convinced that it's terrific and the best database-related tool ever devised
[23:30:14] <oldlaptop> mostly because it's annoying completion popups have a certain brand name or other

[23:30:22] <oldlaptop> *its, cammit
[23:30:28] <oldlaptop> dammit!
[23:30:31] <apotheon> It's generally easier to get code from PostgreSQL into version control than from Oracle, from what I've seen.
[23:30:36] <Gamah> arahael: 68,433 concurrent users
[23:31:24] <Gamah> we haven't fully vetted postgres but it looks like it will be usable now they have some of the featurse that MSSQL has had for decades.
[23:31:30] <apotheon> oldlaptop: I suspect that Intellisense is actually probably better than equivalents elsewhere, generally, but that still doesn't add up to much.
[23:31:32] <arahael> Gamah: obviously postgres for some use cases and sqlite for other use cases.  eg, right now i am using sqlite because there is no reason to install a db server on a... phone...
[23:31:35] <Gamah> HA/failover is still yet to be determined tho
[23:32:02] <Gamah> arahael: agree... and niether postgres or sqlite ticked all the boxes we've needed.
[23:32:05] <arahael> Gamah: pg's model has always been to have those additional features as external addons.
[23:32:07] <Gamah> postgrest might, soon
[23:32:17] <Gamah> yeah and those addons suck
[23:32:19] <apotheon> Yeah, I like the postgres for some, SQLite for others, approach.

[23:33:31] <Gamah> mssql makes sense if you're beena  microsoft shop for 5 decades....
[23:33:45] <Gamah> if i was doing a new startup i don't think i would use it though

[23:34:13] <apotheon> . . . if you're looking for excuses.
[23:34:18] <Gamah> i'd hear them but i don't believe they'd be any good
[23:34:20] <oldlaptop> there are a hell of a lot of client-server database installations (probably *mostly* mysql?) that ought to be sqlite
[23:34:30] <arahael> Gamah: if you're big enough to be able to consider dedicated db managers, you're in a different game.
[23:34:38] <Gamah> oldlaptop: like all of wordpress? lol
[23:34:51] <apotheon> Gamah: I think the reason SpaceX uses MS SQL Server is Elon being kind of a dipshit about Microsoft.
[23:34:53] <Gamah> arahael: yes sorry i wasn't clear about that before.
[23:35:07] <Gamah> apotheon: if it wasn't mssql they'd be using oracle, which is also shite
[23:35:14] <Gamah> postgres just doesn't scale for the kind of stuff they're doing
[23:35:29] <Gamah> same with valve, imo
[23:35:38] <arahael> Gamah: you sure about that?
[23:35:55] <Gamah> i mean valve is in the same position as us... they just always have been a microsoft shop since before postgres was relevant
[23:36:01] <arahael> because in the recent decade they have been excellenr.
[23:36:02] <oldlaptop> Gamah: Probably not *every* wordpress installation in existence, exactly...
[23:36:03] <apotheon> Gamah: I dunno.  Elon might be amenable to PostgreSQL if he wasn't such a Microsoftie.
[23:36:10] <oldlaptop> (just the other 99.9% of them)
[23:36:25] <Gamah> oldlaptop: now how's nitpicking someone's comments? lol
[23:36:40] <Gamah> ...the model T wasn't technicaly interesting... 
[23:37:03] <oldlaptop> Something something exceptions that prove the rule something?
[23:37:11] <apotheon> The Model T's assembly line was a significant contributor to its success.
[23:37:18] <Gamah> definitely
[23:37:24] <apotheon> It brought the availability of the cars up, and the price down.
[23:37:24] <Gamah> the assembly line was novel and new
[23:37:36] <oldlaptop> "Come on, there must be at least, what, three or four wordpress installations in the wild that need a client/server DB"
[23:37:49] <Gamah> yeah but those shouldn't be wordpress sites then
[23:37:57] <oldlaptop> No argument
[23:38:00] <Gamah> :)
[23:38:14] <apotheon> Even WordPress is beginning to realize there's no excuse for PHP.  Much of WordPress is JavaScript now.
[23:38:15] <oldlaptop> (but in somewhat more seriousness some of them are anyway)
[23:38:16] <Gamah> then you have reddit...
[23:38:24] <Gamah> which until i think 2015? 2016? was a single DB table in mysql
[23:38:26] <apotheon> I don't know if that has improved things at all, though.
[23:38:33] <apotheon> It's still WordPress.
[23:39:02] <apotheon> Gamah: That's horrifying.

[23:53:57] <arahael> literally the only systems where sqlite is avoided tends to be those systems that don't use C, and there's not many of those.

[23:54:57] <oldlaptop> I don't think any of the free BSDs have sqlite in the base system anymore. (openbsd used to, for mandoc)
[23:55:03] <arahael> bdb is basically just key-value.
[23:55:03] <Decker> psh there's sqlite hooks for JS Python blahblah
