[02:39:07] <two2thehead> The reason I was surprised was because I'd assumed it was like a computer game. IE that frames per second had no relation to how fast the music played. But now, as rmmh said, it's apparently all related

[02:46:52] <two2thehead> rmmh, +1 you answered my next question. "So how do I check if a game has FPS limitations?" Answer"check to see if they have frame pacing or timing"
[02:47:14] <saturn2> computer games have to run on a variety of different computers that run at different speeds, but every game boy was identical, so there was no need to bother with timers independent of the CPU speed
[02:47:23] <rmmh> there was an awkward era where to play old games at reasonable speeds you'd unpress the turbo button 
[02:48:07] <rmmh> and yes, as saturn2 says, consoles let you cheat. plus you tend to be tied to vsync with those real old machines 
[02:48:13] <two2thehead> I'm reminded of an ooooold adventure game which had a button press repition game. It calculated how many times you had to lift the weight by looking at the CPU speed. So... naturally this didn't age well :V

[03:15:05] <gwern> quanticle: :(
[03:15:13] <quanticle> Why :(
[03:15:38] <gwern> it explains pretty well why these weirdo sizes are a bad sign
[03:15:39] <kuudes> what if you would have a custom hover when on top of link, which would on default point to amazon, but have an icon you could click to go to libgen or google scholar?
[03:15:49] <kuudes> then you could just disable libgen link in case of dmca
[03:16:09] <quanticle> Oh, yeah, they're coming out with these because 128GB modules will take too long
[03:16:14] <gwern> I just rewrite the links when I get a DMCA, not sure how the popup would help
[03:16:43] <gwern> a dynamic approach might reduce the danger from like legal scanners, which won't be running JS in a browser VM, perhaps
[03:17:25] <kuudes> yeah, and then you are not pointing to *just* libgen, but to multiple sources
[03:17:33] <kuudes> which seems less dangerous
[03:17:36] <gwern> I suppose we should be happy that DRAM is changing at all. RAM size has long been the most stagnate area of PCS. how many desktops are *still* running with sizes that would've drawn little comment a decade ago like 8GB?
[03:17:38] <kuudes> "hey, it was one source"
[03:19:26] <quanticle> Yeah, but on the other hand, we've finally reached an era where successive versions of operating systems don't require ever more RAM
[03:19:32] <quanticle> Are we really sure we want that to end?
[03:19:45] <two2thehead> hm
[03:19:52] <two2thehead> quanticle, good point
[03:20:23] <adiabatic> I thought we reached that for 7
[03:20:36] <quanticle> Yes, that's basically when RAM capacities started to stagnate.
[03:20:53] <two2thehead> Wait, *is* there much room for programs to use more RAM? I thought the room for growth was in parallel processing?
[03:21:11] <quanticle> Well, how are you going to parallel process anything when you can't fit the data set in RAM?
[03:21:16] <adiabatic> that's also when Microsoft and Apple started making mobile versions of their operating systems
[03:21:21] <two2thehead> hm
[03:21:33] <adiabatic> two2thehead: sure. 8K HDR video, 8K HDR Photoshop things
[03:21:49] <two2thehead> adiabatic, ah
[03:21:56] <quanticle> Except Microsoft abandoned the mobile version of its operating system, but Windows 10 has the same minimum memory requirement as Windows 7.
[03:22:16] <gwern> I think we'd also seem more AI progress if you had GPUs with more like a terabyte of RAM each. it'd make the engineering just a lot easier, and allow more experimentation with space-time tradeoffs, skipping workarounds like checkpointing etc
[03:23:13] <gwern> collectively, we seem to waste a lot of time on "oh, sorry, that model won't fit on anything under a V100. hm, and you'll need to freeze bunch of layers and do checkpointing even just to finetune it. and it takes a fancy complex framework to train it in the first place because even a single model copy doesn't fit on a GPU. and..."
[03:23:27] <quanticle> Overall, though, I do see gwern's point. As he pointed out a while ago, if your computer runs out of CPU, it slows down. If it runs out of RAM, it stops.
[03:23:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> If we had more AI progress then we'd just be dead faster
[03:23:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Thank god for these engineering difficulties
[03:23:50] <adiabatic> if it runs out of RAM, then your computer slows down because it starts using a swapfile
[03:23:52] <rmmh> ah yeah why didn't they think of that
[03:23:53] <gwern> "oh, we can't use the better optimizer which is stable because it uses 2x more memory for the statistics. just fuck around with the hyperparameters until you find something that doesn't diverge?"
[03:24:00] <rmmh> just throw in 1TB of GDDR6
[03:24:12] <saturn2> there's always room to build yet another layer of pointless bloat into operating systems
[03:24:18] <gwern> AMD has some very high RAM GPUs, but alas, they're AMD GPUs
[03:24:22] <quanticle> adiabatic: You'd think so, but whenever my computer has run out of RAM to the point where its started to swap, it's been indistinguishable from a total hang.
[03:24:29] <quanticle> Which requires a reboot.
[03:24:33] <adiabatic> what OS
[03:24:43] <quanticle> Both Windows & Linux
[03:24:50] <adiabatic> interesting
[03:24:52] <gwern> yeah, that's been true for me on linux for at least a decade now. once it starts thrashing, just give up and reboot.

[03:25:21] <gwern> you might wait hours and it'll still be churning through god knows what quadratic or exponential with huge diskload constants
[03:25:22] <saturn2> sysrq+f
[03:25:35] <quanticle> Oddly enough, Linux has been worse here. With Windows, I could eke just barely enough response out of the system to close some stuff and release memory. With Linux, it was stuck to the point where I had to hard-reset the system.
[03:25:57] <adiabatic> linux just has a swap partition that can't be resized, right?
[03:26:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: You've never seen "you have run out of application memory" messages on macOS? I see them on occasion
[03:26:22] <quanticle> rmmh: Except that in a lot of distros, sysrq is disabled by default :(
[03:26:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> It says stuff like "some of these apps have been suspended, force quit some of them or you can't do shit at all"
[03:26:38] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: not with 32 GB of RAM, I don't
[03:26:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Arcturus has 32 GB
[03:26:57] <saturn2> linux can use swap files but they don't grow automatically
[03:26:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> I see them anyhow
[03:27:05] <adiabatic> also, double-digit (tops) tab counts among all my open browsers
[03:27:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> And swap files on macOS grow automatically
[03:27:10] <rmmh> quanticle: yes, I'm saying re-enable sysrq
[03:27:12] <quanticle> Yeah, I should add this was a long time ago, but it's affected me to the point where I max out the RAM on every machine I build or buy.
[03:27:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatic: Well, there you have it
[03:27:18] <rmmh> also disable swap
[03:27:20] <rmmh> swap sucks
[03:27:29] <rmmh> without swap the oom killer reaps things quickly
[03:27:44] <quanticle> rmmh: Yes, that's all great advice, but it's not exactly helpful in the moment when your machine has locked up, haha
[03:27:48] <rmmh> make a workstation with 32+GB of RAM and disable swap
[03:28:03] <rmmh> I regularly write runaway programs that cause this problem so I have a fair amount of experience here :v
[03:28:18] <quanticle> And I did enable sysrq afterwards, because I didn't realize that Fedora disabled it by default.
[03:28:20] <saturn2> swap is good though
[03:28:27] <adiabatic> still learning how to write tail-call recursive programs, rmmh? :P
[03:28:34] <saturn2> fedora is bad
[03:28:35] <adiabatic> functions*
[03:28:35] <gwern> (I think on laptops you still want swap for hibernate/suspend, but yes, I stopped making swap partitions on my workstations)
[03:28:46] <rmmh> I ran into this 5 times writing AOC programs
[03:28:55] <gwern> the price of living dangerously
[03:28:58] <quanticle> Yeah, I kept the swap partition. I just re-enabled sysrq to be able to force a somewhat clean reboot rather than having to hold down the power button.
[03:29:01] <adiabatic> oh yeah. that was a thing this year.
[03:29:06] <quanticle> Last year.
[03:29:27] <adiabatic> it doesn't feel like 2020 episode 2 yet.
[03:29:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> I should finish AOC at some point
[03:29:41] <saturn2> why would they disable sysrq? just to make users suffer?
[03:30:07] <adiabatic> what is sysrq anyway? I remember the button on keyboards but never saw it in action
[03:30:26] <rmmh> system request
[03:30:38] <adiabatic> right but what's it for
[03:30:46] <rmmh> ""
[03:30:48] <rmmh> The specific low level function intended for the SysRq key was to switch between operating systems. When the original IBM-PC was created in 1980, there were three leading competing operating systems: PC DOS, CP/M-86, and UCSD p-System,[2] while Xenix was added in 1983–1984. The SysRq key was added so that multiple operating systems could be run on the same computer, using the capabilities of
[03:30:50] <rmmh> the 286 chip in the PC/AT.
[03:31:00] <rmmh> using the 286 to implement VMs, heh
[03:31:07] <adiabatic> everything old is new again
[03:31:11] <adiabatic> nothing new under the sun
[03:31:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Classic recipes [for seven minute frosting] call for sugar and egg whites in proportions ranging from 2:1 all the way to 5:1 by weight" ... I'm sorry, all the way to WHAT
[03:31:37] <two2thehead> so *that's* what SysRq key does/was intended to do
[03:31:55] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: :flag_us:
[03:31:56] <saturn2> linux uses it for hotkey commands related to killing processes and emergency rebooting

[03:38:27] <PlanckWalk> 4 of the 5 top memory hogs on my system at the moment are Java apps.  In 4th place is Firefox.
[03:39:03] <quanticle> Which apps, if I might ask?

[03:41:33] <PlanckWalk> Eclipse is top hog at the moment, two game servers (Wurm Unlimited), and a map editor.  I'm not running Minecraft right now, but that is a hog too on the rarer occasions when I run it.
[03:42:39] <rmmh> eh it's a notch game it counts
[03:42:43] <PlanckWalk> Heh, true
[03:44:15] <quanticle> I didn't realize Notch had any games of even moderate success other than Minecraft.

[03:50:11] <quanticle> He proposes thinking about supply as the supplier's demand for their own good or service
[03:50:46] <PlanckWalk> They don't want it.
[03:51:13] <PlanckWalk> At best, they want to sell it to future consumers who will pay more than $1 for a BMW.
[03:52:07] <PlanckWalk> Ugh, "By forgoing the dollar that I offer them, they are effectively buying the car for $1"
[03:52:17] <PlanckWalk> No!  They already own it!
[03:52:38] <rmmh> the value of something is what you'll give up to have it
[03:53:00] <PlanckWalk> Yes, they value it at more than $1, but they're not *buying* it.
[03:53:48] <quanticle> Moreover, how does that work at the level of the factory? Does the factory have an implied demand for raw material that it's willing to forego only if it can sell finished goods for a certain price?
[03:53:57] <PlanckWalk> They might hypothetically buy a BMW if someone else was selling one for $1, but that's a different transaction with different expectations.
[03:54:38] <PlanckWalk> They certainly won't buy a BMW that you try to sell them for anything like close to the price they sell them for.

[04:07:39] <kuudes> ie the dealership has the car in their balance sheet for 40k, and their loans from bank value their balance sheet by factor of 60%
[04:07:57] <kuudes> so if they sell it lower than 24k, they realize immediate loss

[04:17:11] <PlanckWalk> If they choose not to accept your order for $1, do they somehow "have a demand for cars"?
[04:18:14] <PlanckWalk> If you ask them to make you a boat instead for $1 million and they refuse, do they "have a demand for boats"?
[04:19:32] <PlanckWalk> All their examples are talking about trading pre-existing goods, and nothing about *making new goods* which is the essence of supply, so maybe that's why they're confusing themselves.

[05:11:57] <kuudes> data lags seem to affect owid more than national data pages, which is not surprising
[05:12:22] <PlanckWalk> It looks like about 2-3% hospitalization here for a 92%+ vaccinated population.
[05:12:24] <kuudes> but it seems next week is at least the week icus should start heading up in some places, maybe deaths as well
[05:12:37] <kuudes> you guys vaccinate also under 5?
[05:13:03] <PlanckWalk> Sorry, right.  92%+ of 12+ population
[05:13:25] <kuudes> yeah, that does not matter that much for omicron, it spreads in kids well and also puts them hospital more than previous variants
[05:13:25] <PlanckWalk> We don't have any younger in hospital yet here.
[05:13:53] <PlanckWalk> It's hard to say what the rate is for them here
[05:13:55] <kuudes> that was weird in south africa, all previous waves and omicron had put something like 10% of 0-4 years olds to hospital there
[05:14:15] <kuudes> which seemed really different to western data
[05:14:41] <PlanckWalk> South African data looks weird in general
[05:15:15] <PlanckWalk> I wonder if they mostly just don't test children unless they're really sick
[05:17:06] <PlanckWalk> All their demographic breakdowns are completely different from other places with decent data.
[05:17:37] <kuudes> yes
[05:17:44] <kuudes> which is why I generally discount their data
[05:17:52] <kuudes> and follow closely uk, denmark and norway
[05:18:10] <PlanckWalk> Can't trust Australian data any more :-(
[05:18:50] <kuudes> nor finnish; helsinki and other places have now in practice mostly stopped testing when they had positivity rates of 40%+
[05:19:09] <PlanckWalk> Our fearless leaders decided that they're only doing PCR tests under very restricted circumstances, and rpid antigen tests don't get reported at all.
[05:19:37] <kuudes> over here the health ministry would want the local government to do more, but they oppose
[05:19:49] <kuudes> but it seems from google data that finns are still good at hiding at homes
[05:19:59] <PlanckWalk> Also PCR test positivity rate went above 25% in most places
[05:20:03] <kuudes> so a major thing is if people keep their kids home on their own volition or not
[05:21:14] <PlanckWalk> Good news though!  We're eligible for boosters 3 months after the 2nd dose in February!  (Currently 5 months)
[05:21:21] <kuudes> finally the health institute relented before christmas and allowed the government to make a statute allowing 5+ years get vaccinated *if* both of their parents consent
[05:21:38] <PlanckWalk> Most places here are starting to vaccinate 5-11
[05:21:56] <PlanckWalk> (Way too late)
[05:22:07] <kuudes> mind you that the requirement to wait for the specific kids doses in orange capped bottles is insane as well
[05:22:25] <kuudes> as you can make kids doses by drawing just 1/3 of adult dose from adult dose purple bottle
[05:22:31] <kuudes> it is the same stuff.
[05:22:43] <PlanckWalk> I guess it could save on accidentally giving adult doses to young children
[05:23:03] <kuudes> well it does not matter that much per safety data
[05:23:17] <PlanckWalk> Ah aokay, nice to know
[05:23:31] <kuudes> basicly the pfizer mrna is sort of the safest substance on earth; not actually, but very near
[05:23:34] <PlanckWalk> I hadn't seen data on what happens if young children get adult doses
[05:23:58] <kuudes> well the first thing in the kids vaccine study was that they trialed 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3 of adult dose
[05:24:15] <kuudes> and found that 1/3 had least adverse effects; though the others were fine as well
[05:24:31] <kuudes> then they tested that dosage for kids + placebo
[05:25:19] <kuudes> I am no doctor, but per my reading of the results and some expert opinions that are way less bullish than I am on the vaccine, it seems to me that maybe that kids dose would be perfectly fine for adults as well
[05:25:35] <kuudes> so it could just be that we should just give 10 units for everyone (adult dose is 30 units)
[05:25:49] <kuudes> ... which would also solve a lot of supply issues
[05:26:06] <kuudes> as 6 dose bottles would become not just 7-8 dose bottles but 18-24 dose bottles
[05:26:17] <rmmh> Based on the moderna vs Pfizer, disagree
[05:26:22] <kuudes> oh?
[05:26:32] <kuudes> how so?
[05:27:10] <PlanckWalk> Moderna does seem to be slightly more effective, but hard to tell whether that's only due to dose difference.
[05:27:27] <kuudes> yeah; but there are also papers which suggest pfizer is better specifically against omicron
[05:27:51] <kuudes> and they seem to be within error bounds usually; but yes, moderna was better against delta at least
[05:27:54] <PlanckWalk> Supply isn't as much of an issue now (in the richer countries, at least)
[05:28:23] <kuudes> over here our chief vaccinologist has made a lot of effort to hamper people not in specific risk groups from getting booster doses
[05:28:35] <PlanckWalk> But in the earlier days, I suspect that 1/3 doses in half the rollout time would have been very much better.
[05:28:37] <kuudes> because she is on opinion that we should give more doses to africa I guess
[05:28:56] <kuudes> well and you could just give them more often
[05:29:09] <mjr> (unclear on whether it's been adequately differentiated that the mRNA vaccine differences are not due more to differing scheduling than dosage, though not to say that the dosage differences are trivial either)
[05:29:09] <kuudes> a dose for everyone once per 4 months should clearly be a target
[05:29:29] <kuudes> did moderna have also different schedule, mjr?
[05:29:53] <kuudes> weren't they both second dose 3 weeks after first in their spec?
[05:29:56] <mjr> 4 weeks instead of 3, officially, and as used in eg US where the data is IIRC from
[05:30:09] <kuudes> oh, thats good to know

[05:30:26] <kuudes> yeah; a lot of things seem to ride on longer period being a bit better
[05:30:40] <kuudes> but it seems to me that if we could just use smaller dose, we could dose people up more times
[05:30:49] <kuudes> so from 2*30 you would instead get 6*10 doses
[05:31:04] <kuudes> so as in finland as we have had 13 weeks between 1 and 2 doses
[05:31:11] <mjr> I was told that the active mRNA wasn't the most limiting ingredient actually, but haven't verified this
[05:31:35] <kuudes> hmm? that I didn't know
[05:31:37] <PlanckWalk> Wow, 13 weeks to 2nd?
[05:31:39] <kuudes> yes
[05:31:47] <gwern> rmmh: linked it this morning :)
[05:32:09] <kuudes> finland didn't have a lot of local spread back then, it was decent decision
[05:32:11] <PlanckWalk> That's very different from the recommended.  I haven't looked at data about which is better
[05:32:21] <kuudes> longer is better.
[05:32:50] <kuudes> but the point was not mainly to get it better, but to get more of first doses first stuff
[05:33:03] <mjr> longer does seem to be better but gets worse if you have a very acute situation ... Anyway the long interval was partially because of availability issues since much ameliorated.
[05:33:19] <kuudes> ie under 60 nonrisk people basicly got their 1st dose at the point the others started to get their second doses
[05:33:24] <kuudes> mjr, yes
[05:33:31] <mjr> And indeed nowadays they do shots with a minimum of 6 weeks interval
[05:34:11] <mjr> (and boosters at 4 months after that)
[05:34:17] <kuudes> my older daughter gets her dose at the spec recommended 3 week interval because she is in the study; I try to get the same for her younger sister as well
[05:35:22] <kuudes> so hopefully some week after their second dose they could return to school and daycare, and hopefully the peak people would have been moved to the freezer and hospitals would have more space
[05:36:58] <kuudes> but indeed the leading researcher Rämet here proposed halving of first doses instead of postponing second doses, though postponing was the one which was selected
[05:37:34] <kuudes> but could be indeed things like two weeks between 10 units for 10 weeks (6 doses) would work fine
[05:37:58] <kuudes> though I guess the main bottleneck is vaccinations
[05:39:21] <kuudes> if a nation can vaccinate 1% of its population per day, it can vaccinate 360% of population per year
[05:39:35] <kuudes> so 3 meetings to majority, 4 for some (risk groups?)
[05:40:57] <kuudes> but yeah. I am so angry she managed to waste us many months and some 1.2M potential vaccination appointments
[05:41:04] <kuudes> 1/3 of population amount
[05:41:16] <kuudes> and she still is in her position
[05:41:43] <PlanckWalk> We had no problem vaccinating half our population in a month
[05:43:01] <PlanckWalk> As in, a peak at that rate once supply was available.
[05:47:50] <kuudes> yeah, 2% per day is doable at least for a while
[05:47:57] <kuudes> that gets you to 60% in a month
[05:48:03] <kuudes> but not 10% per day
[05:48:29] <kuudes> it seems western countries hover steady around 1% per day on longer term average
[05:48:53] <kuudes> mind you that that is 60% of population in doses, so 1 dose for 60% of population or 2 doses for 30%
[05:49:05] <kuudes> or 1 for 50% and 2 for 10%
[05:50:51] <PlanckWalk> Yeah, I was thinking in terms of longer-term boosters
[05:51:11] <PlanckWalk> Bossters per 3 months should be sustainable
[05:52:05] <PlanckWalk> Though really I doubt that booster efficacy will diminish so rapidly
[05:53:39] <kuudes> it seems to increase higher that the start level

[06:00:48] <PlanckWalk> I tried re-watching Friends recently.  It was just bad.  Not "bad but funny in a cringey way"
[06:02:28] <PlanckWalk> It depended upon the culture of the time in a way that wasn't so obvious to me at the time.

Microsoft Systems Journal was an interesting case. Although M SJ was originally supposed to be

Art people love very narrow text columns, and I remember MSJ going to extra-narrow columns at about the same time that the OS/2 Presentation Manager was introducing function calls like
[06:14:25] <feepbot> GpiQueryModelTransformMatrix.'
[06:17:36] <PlanckWalk> When I was re-watching I noticed a lot of things that were subtle references to events of the time but now I had to consciously think "what? Oh yeah, that happened", or now are accepted and aren't things to laugh at like homosexual overtones.  Lots more stuff but I can't bring it to mind right now.
[06:21:10] <PlanckWalk> Like most of the scenes in which Ross' ex-wife being a lesbian came up, it was somehow expected to be funny in its own right, with studio laughter reminding you that you're supposed to laugh for some reason.
[06:21:49] <PlanckWalk> At the time, yeah maybe?  These days?  Not so much.
[06:23:11] <saturn2> isn't it still funny when you're the guy who makes a woman realize she's a lesbian?
[06:23:27] <PlanckWalk> Eh, more likely she was always bi.

Money quote from the defense lawyer: “It wasn’t until you pointed your gun at him, advanced on him, with your gun (and your hands down)
[07:01:33] <feepbot> pointed at him, that he fired?

He then flees and is chased by bystanders before tripping, falling to the ground and
[07:01:33] <feepbot> shooting another man.” A day later, in another NYT piece (which I relied on at the time), here’s the account of video footage they embedded: “As Mr. Rittenhouse is running, he trips and falls to the ground. He fires four shots as three people rush toward him. One person appears to be hit in the chest and falls to the ground. Another, who is carrying a handgun [Grosskreutz],
[07:01:38] <feepbot> is hit in the arm and runs away.” Any sense of self-defense there?

[11:50:19] <ggreer> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton_618 an event horizon 2600AU across. that's pretty big
[11:50:20] <Robomot> Ton 618 - Wikipedia (Coordinates: 12h 28m 24.97s, +31° 28′ 37.7″ / Ton 618 is a hyperluminous, broad-absorption-line, radio-loud quasar located near the border of the constellations Canes Venatici and Coma Berenices, with the projected comoving distance of approximately 18.2 billion light-years from Earth.[note 1] It possesses one of the most massive black holes ever found, with a mass of 66 billion M☉.[2])
[11:50:30] <ggreer> err 1300 AU across
[11:51:07] <ggreer> nevermind it's 2600 AU. stupid wikipedia using radius instead of diameter

[13:03:16] <adiabatty> good name
[13:07:24] <act> nshepperd2: it's a non-evil startup
[13:07:38] <act> esports! 
[13:08:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's evil though
[13:09:28] <act> how is that evil 
[13:09:51] <act> we only kill virtual people with virtual guns
[13:11:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think a startup for actual guns would be less evil than an esports startup
[13:12:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway what kind of esports?
[13:12:51] <saturn2> esports seems less evil than the median startup, so that's almost the same thing as being good ? ??? ????????
[13:15:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm, I guess that's possible? I don't have a good sense of what the *median* startup is
[13:22:45] <act> I mean, I'd quite like to do actual good things 
[13:23:04] <act> if we can get enough eyes on us I'd like to do what Raising and Giving or High-Impact Athletes do 
[13:23:39] <act> I'm a pledger, though, so part of the plan is just "acquire skills, experience, money and power so I can save the world later" 
[13:24:16] <act> why do you think actual guns are less evil than virtual guns? 
[13:26:15] <saturn2> "GoFungibles is a cross-chain state-of-the-art NFT marketplace equipped with all the existing features of conventional NFT marketplaces but augmented with DeFi and gamified components." median-ish startup, i figure
[13:27:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> act: Actual guns (as sold by startups) are reasonably likely to be put to good use, whereas virtual guns (as sold by startups) are mostly likely to be used to fleece people of money to no good end, while also harming people's lives
[13:28:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> (These are not general properties of actual/virtual guns, just how they fit into the startup context, esp. with esports specifically for the latter)
[13:29:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Ok yeah I guess it's not implausible that esports would be a bit less evil than that (though could also be more evil, depends on implementation details)
[13:29:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Always possible to add mictrotransactions and gacha and Skinner boxes to these things
[13:29:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And NFTs too, for that matter)
[13:30:37] <act> I'm not getting sucked into an irc debate about gun control, that's a trap 
[13:30:53] <act> NFTs are terrible 
[13:31:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh, it certainly wasn't my intention to start a gun control argument
[13:31:19] <act> nor are we selling games 
[13:31:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess I didn't anticipate disagreement on that particular aspect of things
[13:31:36] <act> you.... don't remember anything about me, do you
[13:31:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> I remember that you were in this channel at some point
[13:31:57] <act> we've yelled at each other for *hours* because I hate guns 
[13:31:58] <act> :p
[13:32:01] <act> Years ago 
[13:32:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that you're ... British? Is that true?
[13:32:09] <act> Scottish, now 
[13:32:34] <act> I remember that you're disagreeable and don't agree with me about anything political 
[13:32:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm gonna put that down as "remembered correctly" ... :p

[13:33:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, I guess if you think that actual guns are substantively evil, then, fair enough, probably even the median startup is less evil than like, Armalite or w/e
[13:33:55] <act> *voting
[13:34:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh ok
[13:34:23] <act> It's very nice here 
[13:34:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, good luck, Scottish independence seems like a good thing to me, though that's strictly an uninformed opinion
[13:35:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> So what *does* your startup do
[13:36:26] <act> as of like yesterday I'm doing a blog 
[13:36:29] <saturn2> _____ in minecraft as a service
[13:36:31] <act> https://thephilosophergamer.substack.com/
[13:36:32] <Robomot> The Philosopher Gamer | The Philosopher-Gamer | Substack (Reflections from a Head Coach & esports CEO. Click to read The Philosopher Gamer, by The Philosopher-Gamer, a Substack publication. Launched 21 hours ago.)
[13:37:03] <act> I'm going to try and be the kind of pseudonymous where I write for a non-esports audience and my esports crowd mostly has no idea that I've got a blog
[13:37:42] <act> if you've heard of organisations like TSM or cloud 9, we're trying to be that 
[13:37:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have not
[13:37:54] <act> we have teams of professional video gamers 
[13:38:00] <act> we hire coaches to make them better teams 
[13:38:12] <act> and we hire graphic designers to make them seem really cool and sexy and badass
[13:38:18] <act> then we hope that they win tournaments 
[13:38:22] <act> and if they do, we get fans 
[13:38:27] <act> then we sell merch to the fans
[13:38:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't you mean "they get fans"
[13:38:51] <act> both 
[13:39:00] <act> they represent our brand 
[13:39:22] <act> prestige flows both ways; a player gets clout for being associated with a prestigious brand, we get clout if we have prestigious players 
[13:39:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmmm I see
[13:39:51] <act> if we sign a player, fans of that player are likely to decide that they like us, and then maybe they check out our other players 
[13:40:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> And this is a thing that some other companies are already doing?
[13:40:11] <act> we're a team in a minor league at the moment, and the slot in the league belongs to us 
[13:40:19] <act> we field whatever players we want in that slot 
[13:40:41] <act> it is fairly similar to owning football teams 
[13:41:00] <act> plenty of people are fans of specific footballers but plenty of people are also fans of, say, Chelsea the club/team
[13:41:56] *** Joins: Gurkenglas (~Gurkengla@dslb-002-203-144-204.002.203.pools.vodafone-ip.de)
[13:42:03] <act> then you also make money by doing things like, let's say you're a teenage video gamer and you want to play games in a positive, structured, disciplined environment rather than just hacking zombies mindlessly until 3am 
[13:42:26] <act> you can sign those players up to amateur teams and often they're willing to pay for things like a coach who tells them how to stop sucking
[13:42:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Aren't you just describing the difference between single-player and multiplayer games
[13:42:36] <act> I do that as an individual freelance service too 
[13:42:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, in general
[13:42:56] <act> if you want to know how to not suck at video games, pay me per-hour and I teach you
[13:43:00] <act> no 
[13:43:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean the bit about "you want to play games in a positive, structured, disciplined environment rather than just hacking zombies mindlessly until 3am"
[13:43:34] <act> there is a huge difference between just hanging out with friends playing multiplayer games on a Saturday night, and belonging to a team that has structured team practices 3x a week and a coach and a manager 
[13:44:05] <act> belonging to a team means you get together 3x a week and you *drill* specific strategies with the exact same people 
[13:44:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Don't some people play video games competitively without paying anyone for anything
[13:44:09] <act> then you go enter tournaments 
[13:44:13] <act> yes 
[13:44:29] <act> some people are very good at video games and some coaches also work for free 
[13:44:41] <act> other people make millions of dollars 
[13:44:47] <act> it's like any art industry 
[13:44:57] <act> some people are very good artists who make excellent art for free as a hobby 
[13:45:04] <act> other people make millions 
[13:45:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok but
[13:45:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Art specifically seems like a singularly bad comparison
[13:45:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> Almost the worst possible comparison
[13:45:33] <act> like any sport, then
[13:45:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure
[13:45:40] <act> plenty of people play sports for free 
[13:45:55] <act> other people get very large amounts of money for selling football jerseys advertising a specific team brand
[13:46:02] <act> it's a complicated ecosystem 
[13:46:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is the trick here that for some games there are competitions where you can make lots of money from prizes or ad contracts etc.?
[13:46:16] <act> there are indeed some games where the prize pools are huge 
[13:46:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that's why people want so badly to get good that they're willing to pay coaches?
[13:46:24] <act> there is also this thing called advertising 
[13:46:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes that's what I said, ad contracts
[13:46:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, that's the substance of the sports analogy, right?
[13:46:59] <act> it's literally exactly like sports 
[13:47:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[13:47:14] <act> the only difference is that people are playing video games and not football 
[13:47:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sure sure
[13:47:18] <act> but the same revenue sources exist 
[13:47:31] <act> you can even sell tickets to physical arenas where tournaments are happening 
[13:47:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> I ask this just because this seems disjoint from the whole
[13:47:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> "let's say you're a teenage video gamer and you want to play games in a positive, structured, disciplined environment rather than just hacking zombies mindlessly until 3am"
[13:47:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> thing
[13:47:51] <act> it's like 
[13:48:07] <act> some kids kick a ball around with friends in the playground 
[13:48:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[13:48:14] <act> other kids belong to their high school football team 
[13:48:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[13:48:34] <act> which involves having a specific position like a striker or something, and a coach, and coming to practice 3x a week 
[13:48:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Right
[13:48:51] <act> frequently the parents of these kids will pay a small fee to sign their kids up for the high school football team
[13:48:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Exactly, so you can belong to your high school football team, but then never make any money from this or have any intention of doing so etc.
[13:49:00] <act> which pays for shit like coaches 
[13:49:06] <act> and team jerseys
[13:49:08] <saturn2> anyway good luck with your startup, i hope you get absurdly rich
[13:49:16] <act> Thank you I hope so too
[13:49:34] <Betawolf> it sounds like the sort of thing where people make lots of money somehow.
[13:49:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> act: Have you read Dan Luu's article about getting good at stuff, and if so, what are your thoughts on it
[13:49:46] <act> No
[13:49:52] <act> I have never heard of Dan Luu
[13:49:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> (He uses competitive video games as his case study / example, hence the relevance)
[13:50:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh well he's a tech person who has a blog, often writes interesting stuff
[13:50:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> https://danluu.com/p95-skill/ this is the essay
[13:50:39] <Robomot> 95%-ile isn't that good
[13:50:56] <act> if he isn't an esports professional then the likelihood of me respecting his opinions on competitive video gaming is fairly low 
[13:51:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> That seems very silly
[13:51:37] <act> is there any reason to think that this person has domain expertise about video games? 
[13:51:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> esports is exactly the kind of field where the notion of "professional" makes almost no sense and where many of the people with the most useful things to say will be "amateurs"
[13:52:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> act: Who cares
[13:52:26] <act> uh, no it isn't 
[13:52:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> What even is "domain expertise about video games" other than "have played video games enough to know stuff, have thought about things, reached correct conclusions, etc."
[13:52:41] <act> esports is one of the most meritocratic fields I can think of actually 
[13:52:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, exactly
[13:52:53] <act> if you are very good then it is literally *free* to enter a tournament and then you can prove it 
[13:52:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's meritocratic, which is the opposite of professionalization
[13:53:29] <act> if you don't win tournaments and make money then the likelihood that you are any good is very low
[13:53:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Knowing things about it is therefore just as meritocratic *if not more*
[13:53:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> But who cares if he's *good*
[13:53:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's like saying
[13:54:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I refuse to read any articles about chess tournaments or chess history or chess at all *except* from grandmasters of Kasparov quality or higher"
[13:54:26] <act> oh LMAO this post is about overwatch
[13:54:29] <act> I'll let you know what I think
[13:54:32] <act> I'm curious
[13:54:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or like
[13:55:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Baskeball commentary better come from Michael Jordan or else no one"
[13:55:55] <act> no I just know everyone in the overwatch scene and have opinions on who is worth listening to 
[13:56:08] <act> we all know each other
[13:56:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Sounds like a recipe for groupthink
[13:56:22] <act> LOL
[13:56:33] <act> that is unironically the funniest thing you've said
[13:56:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes that's certainly the reaction I'd expect if what I said were precisely correct
[13:57:00] <act> we all know each other and half of us hate each other 
[13:57:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep I expect so
[13:57:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> In any case I am fairly certain that Dan Luu isn't "in the Overwatch scene"

[14:00:32] <adiabatty> I'd love to be coached to the 50th percentile, but I never installed Boot Camp on my new Mac and that's when Overwatch turned into a game of all hard counters

[14:01:41] <act> you can play whatever the fuck you want up to t2

[14:03:26] <act> you can pick something like a tracer and onetrick the hero to 4.4
[14:03:48] <adiabatty> Is SR still a thing? Or did they totally do away with that
[14:05:15] <adiabatty> all these fucking games have bronze, silver, gold, and then the names turn into something you need to have printed out on a sheet beside your monitor to know what beats what
[14:05:29] <act> SR is a thing
[14:05:51] <act> most games have some variation iron bronze silver gold platinum diamond master grandmaster
[14:05:56] <act> some of them skip iron and start at bronze 
[14:05:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wow
[14:06:05] <act> and many of them change what they call the highest rank 
[14:06:19] <act> like it's a "grand champ" in rocket league instead of grandmaster 
[14:06:33] <act> or an "apex predator" in apex, instead of master/grandmaster 
[14:06:52] <act> valorant has immortal+radiant instead of master+grandmaster
[14:07:05] <act> but it's a fairly established convention that will hold for most games 
[14:07:12] <act> New halo game has "onyx" instead of grandmaster 
[14:07:20] <act> but it still uses bronze silver gold platinum diamond 
[14:08:03] <adiabatty> and then there's dota and CS:GO
[14:10:31] <act> CSGO is designed to upset me 
[14:10:35] <act> specifically

[14:16:40] <act> that sounds like the kind of question I can answer in lots of detail for you if we are doing a pitch meeting where you maybe give me money, but like, I've done a lot of pitch meetings lately and am slightly exhausted 
[14:16:50] <act> we're doing a different thing to most of the t1 and t2 orgs 
[14:17:12] <act> actually I think the grassroots stuff we're doing is completely unique, I'm not *aware* of anyone else doing it
[14:17:14] <adiabatty> ah, no worries
[14:19:01] <act> i don't charge a ton for my time but i do charge. unless I'm having fun
[14:21:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess there are worse ways to make money

[14:22:18] <Robomot> fuckyeah2000s
[14:25:16] <act> alright, this Dan Luu person isn't wrong about most people not getting enough feedback and rapidly improving once they get feedback, but I think he's missing something pretty major 
[14:25:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> act: Oh?
[14:25:51] <act> so like, he says most people playing the game can't possibly be disabled because that should be rare, and besides there's a deaf player who is very good and so on 
[14:26:12] <act> but the thing is that there's fundamental things involved in games like Overwatch that we don't understand and which aren't usually societally important 
[14:26:15] <act> like reflexes 
[14:26:21] <act> or processing speeds
[14:26:49] <act> if someone is unusually bad at spelling and can't improve, we notice it early in education and call that a disability (dyslexia) 
[14:27:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ah, you're saying that in a game like this there's a substantial component of individual variation in ability which is not meaningfully amenable to training?
[14:27:13] <act> if someone is unusually bad at quickly interpreting information delivered by flashing lights and keeping it all in working memory, nobody notices and nobody considers them disabled 
[14:27:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Like height in basketball, to take an extreme example)
[14:27:25] <act> however they *are* disabled in the sense that they will never go above diamond in overwatch 
[14:28:14] <act> if someone is naturally very bad at making split second decisions while being overwhelmed by lots of flashing lights and colours and noises, we don't usually spot that through the education system 
[14:28:28] <act> you will only notice when you try to play video games and realise you are hard capped 
[14:29:47] <act> he gives the example of someone who doesn't touch the objective, which is a stupid error, and says that you can reach 95th percentile by simply not making any really stupid errors - and he's not wrong, but when someone doesn't touch the objective, they don't *feel from the inside* like they're just ignorant and making a stupid error 
[14:29:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is expected a priori, right? It's a background assumption in physical sports, obviously (see above). It's only surprising (or "surprising") because there's some expectation that video games are fully in-principle-accessible to everyone (barring gross disabilities like blindness etc.) and require *only* trainable skills
[14:30:13] <act> they often feel from the inside like "oh fuck oh god there's a lot of overwhelming flashing lights and colours, oh shit I should've touched the objective" 
[14:30:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm
[14:30:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Interesting point
[14:30:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> But is it true?
[14:31:00] <adiabatty> "Standing NEAR the point does nozzink! Stand ON the point, dummkopfs!"
[14:31:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Specifically, doesn't the ability to zero in on the objective, and more generally to see the field of play as comprising distinct relevant objects etc., increase with familiarity and practice?
[14:31:24] <act> yes exactly, it's expected a priori, but lots of people spout the idea that video games are some kind of great leveller - sports are unfair because some people have an advantage due to naturally being stronger or taller or longer-limbed or having more testosterone, but esports is supposed to be totally fair 
[14:31:32] <act> this is nonsense and esports is just as unfair as any sport 
[14:31:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Heh, yes
[14:31:47] <adiabatty> Obormot\Arcturus: sure, but my hard cap is probably way lower than my 4000 SR friends

[14:32:37] <act> it's just that sports are unfair in obvious ways - it's really obvious that some people are taller, stronger, longer limbed, more testosterone, more lightly or heavily built, different metabolism etc - and you can't tell by looking at someone that they have an inherently slower or faster information processing speed
[14:32:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> (I don't have any specific reason to suppose that it does, mind you, just noting that we'd be unsurprised to find that to be true)

[14:34:11] <act> actually I would be pretty surprised if testosterone affected video games
[14:34:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes, I see this sort of thing even in WoW, which is a much less demanding game in terms of twitch reflexes and so on
[14:34:15] <adiabatty> or has yomi > 0
[14:34:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> act: Why so? It's correlated with all sorts of things
[14:34:57] <act> the only effect should be that it maybe makes you more competitive and more likely to want to play? but it should also make you angrier and that's a very very very bad trait in a gamer 
[14:35:22] <adiabatty> act: one ongoing mystery is why women usually self-select into support roles
[14:35:33] <act> that's not a mystery at all 
[14:35:44] <act> women frequently experience harassment for playing non-support roles 
[14:35:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> act: Sure, that's the obvious effect, but I'm saying that testosterone is *also* correlated with other things, not just, like, "acting more stereotypically male"

[14:35:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> "women frequently experience harassment for playing non-support roles" hah what
[14:35:58] <adiabatty> women, or people?
[14:36:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> This sounds made up
[14:36:10] <act> specifically women 
[14:36:16] <act> you are an idiot obormot 
[14:36:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol come on
[14:36:38] <act> I have loaded into lobbies and heard a woman say "hello" and a man immediately respond with "wow we have a woman playing DPS, we're going to lose" and quit 
[14:36:44] <act> leaving the team to play 5v6
[14:36:54] <act> this is a *regular occurrence*
[14:37:20] <act> I have loaded into games and said "hi, how is everyone?" and gotten the response "omg your voice sounds like a woman, can I rape you? women are good for raping" 
[14:37:26] <act> multiple times. 
[14:37:41] <adiabatty> I got basically no harassment but I'm also a boring support player with a win/loss ratio less than one
[14:37:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmm yes well now you see one of the *many* reasons why I am not a fan of esports
[14:38:09] <act> I have spoken directly to women who tried to switch away from support roles and instantly received no tryouts or were kicked off teams
[14:38:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Do you know how many times I've ever heard anyone say anything like that in WoW
[14:38:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> 0 times
[14:38:52] <act> I know a woman who plays WoW who was repeatedly told things like "I hope your entire family gets cancer and dies" when she made a mistake in a raid 
[14:39:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> Does she play on a PVP server?
[14:39:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betcha she does
[14:39:13] <act> if you are not seeing horrible toxic things playing video games then you are probably not playing PvP video games at a high level 
[14:39:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hah!
[14:39:25] <adiabatty> what act said
[14:39:36] <adiabatty> people who're good at vidya get mad at vidya
[14:39:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's funny because the truth of that statement hinges *entirely* on one word
[14:39:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, acronym, I guess
[14:40:05] <act> if you don't believe that women get sexually harassed and death threats etc then that is instant proof that you have never played competitive video games at a high level 
[14:40:16] <adiabatty> Or: as the skill level of your teammate/opponent pool increases, the odds of a rager being on your team approach 1
[14:40:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> act: You misunderstand me
[14:40:41] <act> like, some people play competitive video games at a high level and say things like "men get harassed too", but literally nobody believes "people don't get harassed playing video games" 
[14:41:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> My point isn't that women don't get harassed in PVP games (note: in PVP games! this is *strictly* a PVP phenomenon - non-PVP is a completely different world, and the two contexts are completely unrecognizably different, *regardless* of skill level)
[14:41:43] <adiabatty> act: that's the funny thing. apparently the only difference between getting yelled at and not is the pvp part
[14:41:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yep, 100%
[14:42:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, the thing I was expressing incredulity at is the idea that this is *the* explanation for why women gravitate to support roles
[14:42:35] <act> it's a well known phenomenon that when women stream their games, men will watch the stream and press the queue button at exactly the same time, so that they can hopefully get into the same game as her 
[14:42:43] <act> specifically in order to throw her games 
[14:42:46] <act> it happens a *lot*
[14:43:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because, you see, in non-PVP contexts, this sort of thing ... well, I can't say "never happens", all sorts of things happen, but *very close* to never happens
[14:43:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> AND YET
[14:43:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Women still gravitate to support roles!
[14:43:16] <act> Well, I was going to move on to giving other reasons for this complex phenomenon, but then you said something really stupid about how you think harassment is made up
[14:43:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, to the claim "women get harassed in PVP games", I say "yep and that's why PVP games, esp. in a competitive environment, are a toxic cesspool that attract the worst people"
[14:43:54] <act> Women are also more likely to get into video games later in life because they're less likely to be encouraged to start playing aged 6 - typically I coach a lot of male players who are 17 and already have 10 years of experience, and a lot of women whose families didn't encourage them to play so they didn't start playing until age 15, so they're 17 with 2 years experience
[14:44:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> But to the claim "this is all or most of the explanation for women preferring support roles", nah, bullshit
[14:44:18] <act> and often support is a far more accessible role when you're coming in with less experience
[14:44:27] <act> That is a claim I literally never made
[14:44:33] <act> You just put those words in my mouth
[14:44:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nah
[14:44:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's not even a significant part of the explanation
[14:45:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's a just-so story with almost no relevance to reality
[14:45:30] <act> ok, if you just want to stick to your bullheaded opinion and ignore the domain expert telling you that you're wrong, then you do you I guess
[14:45:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't buy the "get into video games later in life" stuff either
[14:45:37] <act> I don't have the energy to care
[14:45:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> act: Don't give us the "domain expert" stuff. You play video games, that's cool, but lots of people play video games
[14:46:01] <adiabatty> Sure, support is easier to pick up, but why aren't women saying "being a Mercy main sucks ass, and even if I'm playing Ana I'm still not diving into the fray and having fun. I'm gonna rotate between Genji and McCree"
[14:46:11] <act> "I play video games" 
[14:46:13] <adiabatty> at the rates that men are
[14:46:16] <act> I coached the best women's team in North America
[14:46:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Congratulations but so what
[14:46:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm sure that's an impressive achievement, but a "domain expert", it does not make you
[14:46:43] <act> I have *years* of experience running all-women teams across multiple regions and leading women's initiatives in that space
[14:46:50] <act> I've spoken to literally thousands of people about this
[14:46:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not any more than anyone else here who's been a gamer for a long time
[14:47:10] <act> okay, like I said, I really don't have the energy to care
[14:47:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're hardly the first to push the whole "women are harassed *and that is why* they have the preferences they do" story
[14:47:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> (In video games or any other domain)
[14:48:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyhow, I don't buy the "get into video games later in life" stuff either
[14:48:17] <act> adiabatty: it's not just that support is easier to pick up, but there's certain skills that scale over a VERY long time
[14:48:28] <adiabatty> Like?
[14:48:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> I've played WoW for a long time and I've played with a lot of women, and many of them were playing video games at an earlier age than I was
[14:48:49] <nshepperd2> the prospect of being harrassed for playing a non-support role in overwatch does make me less interested in doing it, but i'd probably rather just not play it at all instead in that case
[14:48:59] <act> Decisionmaking and strategy are things that you can pick up at different rates - if you're smart, you can learn as much in a year as someone else might know with ten years' experience 
[14:49:09] <act> But aim really really scales with practice 
[14:49:22] <act> Practising aim for ten years is a HUGE advantage over someone who's practised it for two 
[14:49:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Nor does "support is a far more accessible role when you're coming in with less experience" explain anything, *even if* we buy the first clause!
[14:50:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you look at a high-end raiding guild/team in WoW - nobody there is inexperienced. And yet the gender breakdown of the roles is clear as day...
[14:50:23] <act> okay I'm just going to block Obormot if he keeps speaking absolute nonsense and talk to the interesting people here
[14:50:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha, "absolute nonsense", ok
[14:51:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am *fairly sure* that I'm capable of *counting*
[14:51:21] <adiabatty> act: that would explain a preference for Mercy over Ana, but are there more female Winston mains than, say, McCree mains? "can you click on heads" is orthogonal to "do you prefer dps or support" in Overwatch
[14:51:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> And even dividing one number by another!
[14:52:08] <act> there's actually a fair number of female Dva players, which gets into the other thing 
[14:52:14] <act> Well
[14:52:20] <act> For a start it isn't orthogonal
[14:52:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm just gonna give some numbers, for anyone who's curious about such things
[14:52:34] <act> Ana still requires less aim than Widow or Cass 
[14:52:48] <act> And there *are* more female Ana mains than female Zen mains 
[14:53:00] <act> Strategic thinking is rewarded a little more on support/tank 
[14:53:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> I'm on two raid teams right now, which go as follows
[14:53:16] <act> But there's a *lot* of female Dva players out there, too
[14:53:58] <act> Running a women's community for a long time, main support (lucio/mercy/brig) and off tank (dva/zarya/sigma) were actually our most oversubscribed roles 
[14:54:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Raid team 1: 3 tanks (3 men); 5 healers (5 women); 18 DPS (1 woman, 17 men)
[14:54:32] <act> Main tank and flex support came after that, and yeah, DPS last 
[14:54:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> (One of our healers even transitioned so that we could have that perfect correlation)
[14:54:45] <act> But still we had more flex DPS than hitscans 
[14:54:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> (j/k but I do find it amusing)
[14:55:16] <act> A lot of people like playing characters that they see themselves in, and it's a lot more recently that games have started making cute healer boys 
[14:55:20] <adiabatty> …what is, or what characters are, flex DPS these days?
[14:55:34] <act> Harder to just make a list because there's so many DPS characters 
[14:55:47] <act> Tracer is hitscan, Genji's flex, Sombra can be played by either 
[14:55:58] <act> Cass, Widow, Reaper are all hitscan 
[14:56:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, raid team 2: 3 tanks (3 men); 6 healers (5 men, 1 woman); 17 DPS (15 men, 2 women)
[14:56:11] <act> Pharah, Echo, Mei are FDPS
[14:56:14] <adiabatty> Oh, "flex" is an antonym of "hitscan"?
[14:56:45] <adiabatty> 'hitscan' I know from the Quake days
[14:56:45] <act> How we divide up roles is.... very much an artifice and not a natural category thing, in DPS 
[14:57:09] <act> Basically you don't want to force your DPS players to learn every DPS hero because there's way too many DPS heroes to effectively practise 
[14:57:35] <act> And you also ideally want to be able to flex between the most common meta compositions without making too many swaps, because if you swap heroes then you lose your ult charge 
[14:58:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, I dunno, it *could* be a massive coincidence, or maybe all our healers are getting harrassed all the time the moment they log on to their DPS alts, or maybe they're all noobs and their 99th percentile healing records are flukes, or maybe there's some reason for the correlation! WHO KNOWS
[14:58:21] <act> So if the meta hero combinations are, say, Tracer+Sombra or Tracer+Genji, then you want a Tracer player and a Sombra/Genji player, not a Tracer/Sombra player and a Tracer/Genji player 
[14:58:31] <adiabatty> ah, ok
[14:58:37] <act> Because you want to be able to switch one player directly between Sombra and Genji, and not make your Tracer player switch 
[14:58:54] <act> So technically a "hitscan" is a different aiming style from a "projectile" 
[14:59:29] <act> But strictly by aiming style, Sombra is hitscan, yet she's often considered a flex DPS because lots of meta compositions have included a Tracer+Sombra combination, so you make your hitscan play Tracer and your flex DPS play Sombra 
[14:59:38] <adiabatty> yeah. clicking on heads (mccree) is different from clicking in front of heads (zenyatta)
[14:59:47] <nshepperd2> i play a healer in XIV, which i'd say is actually a more challenging role than dps or tank
[15:00:15] <act> nobody is saying they're noobs or that healer is easier - it's definitely possible for healer to be *harder* and simultaneously more accessible 
[15:00:43] <nshepperd2> i'd attribute this mainly to my personality being more aggreeable and interested in winning via other people
[15:00:53] <act> if healing requires being really smart, then it could be much harder and good healers might be rarer, but a really smart person would also probably be a good healer even if they didn't start playing very young 
[15:01:28] <act> whereas if aim requires *only* practise, then it would be 'easier' in the sense that anyone can get good at it, but less accessible in the sense that you need to start younger 
[15:01:46] <act> this isn't a perfect explanation or anything because healers do require some aim, and it isn't a law that women start playing later 
[15:01:55] <act> it's just a trend and one piece of the overall outcome 
[15:03:19] <act> and yeah, agreeableness is a huge part of it too - it's generally accepted that DPS is an oversubscribed role, so playing a healer is a better career choice in most cases; it makes you more likely to help your team, more likely to get good and succeed, more likely to win 
[15:03:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> nshepperd2: Yeah, it's definitely very odd to claim that a support role somehow takes less experience / skill
[15:03:44] <adiabatty> But that's not true in the women-only leagues?
[15:03:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> Healing is harder than DPS in WoW, for instance!
[15:04:06] <act> yeah women-only leagues it hard reverses, there's far more supports 
[15:04:36] <act> again absolutely nobody is claiming that healing takes less skill
[15:04:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, if we took that whole perspective seriously, we'd have to say things like
[15:04:52] <act> healers need to be more intelligent than dps players
[15:05:15] <act> how intelligent you are is completely independent of whether you started playing games aged 6
[15:05:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Since playing DPS is easier, is that maybe because men start playing video games later and so they're less experienced than women and they're funneled into easier roles?"
[15:05:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> But of course that's nonsense...
[15:05:36] <act> okay I'm muting Obormot 
[15:05:45] <adiabatty> Obormot\Arcturus: that makes no sense
[15:05:47] <act> how do you do that on IRC again? 
[15:05:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: I agree! It makes no sense!
[15:05:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's my point!
[15:05:59] <feep> /ignore person
[15:06:15] <act> thanks feep! 
[15:06:16] <adiabatty> Obormot\Arcturus: act didn't even say that
[15:06:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: Sure she did
[15:06:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> Want me to quote her?
[15:06:41] <adiabatty> act didn't say that men generally start playing games later
[15:06:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: Duh, she said the opposite
[15:07:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's my point
[15:07:02] <adiabatty> Right…
[15:07:12] <act> anyway, if you look at overwatch back before role lock - at the moment in overwatch you load into every game with 2 players from each role, but it used to be that six people loaded into the game and then you argued about who was going to play the healer 
[15:07:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: Right, she said the opposite, and claimed that it explains why women go support, *on the premise that support is easier*
[15:07:31] <act> usually everyone wanted to play DPS, and someone would grudgingly agree to play healer in order to help the team win 
[15:07:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like so:
[15:07:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> act: Women are also more likely to get into video games later in life because they're less likely to be encouraged to start playing aged 6 - typically I coach a lot of male players who are 17 and already have 10 years of experience, and a lot of women whose families didn't encourage them to play so they didn't start playing until age 15, so they're 17 with 2 years experience
[15:07:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> act: and often support is a far more accessible role when you're coming in with less experience
[15:07:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> See?
[15:07:48] <adiabatty> Right. I remember that.
[15:07:48] <feep> act: kinda surprising for overwatch
[15:07:49] <act> women were WAY more likely to go "yeah I'll take one for the team and play healer" 
[15:07:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> But in fact that's *diametrically wrong* in e.g. WoW
[15:08:00] <feep> I'd have assumed that being as anime as it is, it'd have a good healer rate
[15:08:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> So that implies that we should expect that it's *men* who started playing later, are less experienced, and thus get put into easier roles (i.e., DPS)!
[15:08:18] <act> you get a lot more men with egos going "no, I deserve to play DPS because I'm the best DPS to ever live, someone else should switch" 
[15:08:22] <nshepperd2> act: there's a whole song about it, haha
[15:08:25] <act> yep 
[15:08:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: You see my point?
[15:08:34] <act> feep: not really 
[15:08:41] <act> there's people who play video games for different reasons 
[15:08:46] <adiabatty> I remember seeing this one YouTube video of two women who were fighting over who got to be Mercy. That was amusing.
[15:08:52] <feep> sure, I just mean by cultural milieu
[15:09:10] <act> if you enjoy strategy and teamplay, you're more likely to enjoy tank or support, while if you enjoy seeing your name in the killfeed and pressing buttons fast, you probably enjoy playing DPS 
[15:09:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, I see that my diagnosis of groupthink was completely correct
[15:09:16] <act> DPS is a much more immediate dopamine hit 
[15:09:23] <feep> my model is more like
[15:09:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Someone disputes your claims? Ignore lol
[15:09:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is why it's bad to participate in a small, insular "scene")
[15:09:42] <act> and it just turns out that the group of people who want immediate dopamine hit is a lot larger than the group of people who enjoy being strategic team players 
[15:09:54] <adiabatty> Obormot\Arcturus: I think the three of us are getting confused a bit and, on one hand, there's the WoW-vs-Overwatch difference, and that's not the same thing as some of the things act is familiar with
[15:09:58] <feep> animesque -> soyboys -> healsluttery
[15:10:10] <nshepperd2> ...lol
[15:10:18] <feep> so to hear that you don't even routinely get a sixth healer is surprising 
[15:10:20] <act> LOL yeah healsluts are a thing but I really don't think they explain the majority of player preference
[15:10:29] <act> Like there's absolutely players who kink on that shit 
[15:10:46] <feep> right I wouldn't expect a majority
[15:10:50] <feep> more a reliable minority
[15:10:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: I agree that there's a WoW vs. Overwatch difference, but women gravitate to support roles in *both* games, so clearly any explanation that depends on "it's because those are easier" is immediately revealed to be nonsense, since in WoW those roles *are in fact harder*
[15:11:04] <act> You see people doing a whole kink where the dude is a dom and the woman is a sub and he yells at her if she doesn't heal him, and they load into games with usernames like HerDaddy and HisKitten and absolutely everyone hates them 
[15:11:11] <feep> XDD
[15:11:26] <nshepperd2> jesus
[15:11:33] <feep> I don't even mean like, overt healkink
[15:11:33] <act> you do occasionally see the reverse but it's a LOT rarer, following general kink dynamics 
[15:11:37] <feep> I think that's a spectrum
[15:11:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> In WoW usually the people who are into that thing are gay guys playing healers
[15:11:40] <adiabatty> Obormot\Arcturus: act retreated to, not unreasonably, with the claim, possibly wrong, that healer is easier to pick up (even though it might have a higher skill cap)
[15:11:48] <act> yeah for sure 
[15:11:49] <feep> like, "wanting to feel helpful"
[15:11:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> (No doubt they are also furries and/or other forms of degenerates)
[15:12:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: Which is also false in WoW
[15:12:12] <act> and if you want to feel helpful, mercy is the character 
[15:12:18] <feep> right
[15:12:24] <feep> (also if you want to feel pretty)
[15:12:28] <feep> (convenient)
[15:12:29] <act> like, she's the easiest character in the game and you get to pocket a specific person who sometimes thanks you
[15:12:38] <adiabatty> and, as I learned later, if you want to actually be helpful, switch to '76 and shoot down that damn farah
[15:12:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> adiabatty: There's just no way to construct the argument that playing a healer in WoW takes less skill than playing DPS. Not to start with, not on the high end, not in any way.
[15:12:48] <act> not really imo 
[15:13:05] <act> any time you're playing without role lock, the most actually useful thing you can do is play a main tank 
[15:13:13] <act> reinhardt, winston, wrecking ball or orisa 
[15:13:13] *** Joins: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23)
[15:13:34] <adiabatty> this was before role lock. also, if overwatch is anything like dota, everything's viable in 1000 SR
[15:13:43] <act> it's a common misconception that support is the least popular role because there's a shortage of them, and it IS the least popular category out of "dps, tank, support" 
[15:13:51] <act> But there's six categories in overwatch, not three 
[15:13:55] <act> The game just hides that from you
[15:14:05] <act> The categories are main tank, off tank, hitscan, flex dps, flex support and main support 
[15:14:19] <act> And main tank is by far the rarest and least popular, and simultaneously probably THE most important role 
[15:14:35] <feep> but here's the important question
[15:14:37] <adiabatty> Main tank…who besides Reinhardt?
[15:14:42] <feep> how do those map onto the mtg color wheel
[15:14:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Haha
[15:14:50] <act> reinhardt, winston, wrecking ball, orisa 
[15:15:03] <act> uh, you tell me feep, I don't know the colour wheel well 
[15:15:09] <adiabatty> Orisa…green African robot with six legs?
[15:15:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> This conversation is really reminding me of how dumb Overwatch is
[15:15:22] <feep> it's kinda a meme, sorry
[15:15:29] <act> o ok
[15:15:46] <act> yeah main tanks create space, they have abilities to push chokes and capture high grounds 
[15:16:12] <act> if you do not have a main tank you'll generally feel pinned down and unable to push forwards, like there's no safe way to go aggressive and you're not sure how to make progress 
[15:16:18] <act> or it'll feel like pure chaos
[15:16:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe I should put act on ignore too if she's gonna talk about Overwatch so much
[15:16:36] <act> main tank is your spearhead, and if you have a good one then it won't feel so chaotic 
[15:16:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> We'll see if it peters out though
[15:17:32] <act> there's a lot of stereotypes about the personality of main tanks - loud, charismatic, confident, egotistical, people who really wanna take the lead, strategic/intelligent, big personalities 
[15:17:59] <act> which honestly, I think do fit maybe 60-80% of main tank players 
[15:18:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway speaking of things that suck and other things that don't suck: someone on DSL linked an LotR fanfic they wrote, I started reading it, and a couple of chapters in I was like "ugh, this would be so much better if, instead of being this fanfic, it instead was _The Last Ringbearer_"
[15:18:03] <act> in organised play
[15:18:04] <adiabatty> our regular tank guy was probably about half of those
[15:18:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> And then I realized that I could *stop* reading that fanfic, and instead go reread _The Last Ringbearer_
[15:18:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Which was pretty smart of me if I say so myself
[15:18:35] <act> main tanks give the best hugs 100%
[15:19:09] <feep> :D
[15:19:22] <act> feep: also the thing is that the femboys are a reliable dynamic but they don't reliably play supports 
[15:19:28] <act> a lot of the weebs pick genji 
[15:19:32] <feep> okay
[15:19:36] <act> femboy genji players is absolutely also a stereotype 
[15:19:36] <feep> that makes sense
[15:19:45] <act> femboy dvas
[15:19:50] <act> in Valorant, femboy jetts
[15:20:10] <feep> act: so it's like, because there's a glut of available weeby rules, this weakens the weeb=support effect
[15:20:10] <nshepperd2> Obormot\Arcturus: ahah, good move
[15:20:19] <feep> roles*
[15:20:27] <adiabatty> weird how people stick with a type chosen for reasons other than mechanic compatibility
[15:20:55] <adiabatty> when I started playing dota I thought I was a chicks-with-bows guy (from diablo 2), but then I realized that windrunner and drow had basically nothing in common
[15:21:38] <feep> wait, reno is a female name..?
[15:21:38] <act> I think people do enjoy playing characters that look like them, and so like, women used to gravitate towards Soraka in League 
[15:22:09] <feep> uh, in cataclysm I use autogenerated character names so usually the first time I see my name is when I load a save
[15:22:16] <feep> and apparently my catgirl is "reno parker"
[15:22:16] <adiabatty> feep: brings a totally different meaning to "I shot a man in Reno / just to watch him die"
[15:22:29] <act> There's female characters in league like Morgana and Evelynn but like, if you enjoy playing nice characters who you identify with and aren't super evil, you're on like.... Soraka and Janna 
[15:22:48] <act> more recently games have been doing really really good female DPS rep 
[15:22:52] <act> like Tracer is cute as hell
[15:22:56] <act> Jett is cute as hell 
[15:23:02] <feep> tracer is adorbs
[15:23:07] <act> Girls like playing Jett and Tracer 
[15:23:10] <act> it's definitely helped 
[15:23:54] <act> but there really still isn't a male equivalent to like.... League's Janna, or Overwatch's Mercy, or Valorant's Sage 
[15:24:12] <act> I really do wish games would make uwu pretty femboy healer characters 
[15:24:26] <act> For reasons entirely unrelated to wanting to improve gender balance among players 
[15:25:02] <act> Overwatch has Baptiste and Zen and Lucio as male healers but like.... we don't have an uwu pretty male healer 
[15:25:19] <act> So the femboys are not playing healer :'(
[15:26:49] <adiabatty> is that the kind of boyfriend you want or something
[15:27:11] <feep> you know what, fuck you :unuwus your femboy:?
[15:27:35] <act> I mean 
[15:27:47] <act> I'm bi but I'm not into a single one of OW's male characters 
[15:27:55] <act> OW has never released a pretty male character 
[15:28:04] <act> Very unrelated but it simply makes me sad 
[15:28:17] <feep> :(
[15:28:45] <act> But yeah 
[15:28:49] <feep> I guess we're building a strong gender binary that just happens to be porous
[15:29:01] <act> Playing support is just the objectively correct thing to do for your career in league or overwatch 
[15:29:07] <feep> if you want to be pretty just be a girl
[15:29:09] <adiabatty> makes me wonder if that sort of thing will get OW banned in china
[15:29:16] <adiabatty> like, Tracer's still straight in China
[15:29:17] <act> You will have less competition because there's 8 billion dps players
[15:29:28] <act> Actually if you want to really advance your career you pick main tank 
[15:29:40] <act> Though that's less true now than it has been in the past
[15:30:12] <adiabatty> "no wimpy men in media" sounds like that's something they'd enforce
[15:30:24] <act> Teams used to be willing to pick up main tanks who were far below the skill level of the rest of the team, just because of the shortage of main tanks, and often teams had a hard-carry FDPS because there's so many FDPS players that you can easily afford to get a good one
[15:30:47] <act> Now I'm running a high level open trial and we have a shortage of *FDPS*, of all things
[15:31:05] <act> How the fuck did the community end up with an *fdps* shortage? Nobody fucking knows
[15:31:15] <adiabatty> is it all women
[15:31:21] <act> Nope 
[15:31:38] <adiabatty> weird
[15:31:39] <act> do you watch professional overwatch at all? 
[15:31:57] <act> if you watch North American Contenders then you've seen one of my teams 
[15:32:03] <adiabatty> haven't in years. Had to look up this "Baptiste" character.
[15:32:16] <act> we are running trials for the contenders team atm 
[15:32:28] <act> open trials, we're giving everyone and their dog a fair shot 
[15:32:45] <act> it's........ fun and I'm glad we're doing it and we've won a *lot* of community goodwill
[15:32:50] <act> but it's a fucking headache
[15:33:07] <act> I'm scheduling 80 people into blocks and half of those people will throw a fit if they're in a block with someone they don't like
[15:33:47] <act> managing people's giant fucking egos is a huge part of the skill of doing anything esports-staff-person related
[15:33:50] <kuudes> oh yeah, the china against gay is a thing
[15:34:30] <act> "why am I having to try out with players who are worse than me" says player who has not, at all, proven that they are better than those other players 
[15:34:35] <act> like ten times per day 
[15:35:03] <feep> yeah teamsports are like that
[15:35:21] <act> yep 
[15:35:31] <act> see 
[15:35:53] <act> I have never once heard that complaint from a woman
[15:36:40] <act> whatever is going on with gender, and I don't know exactly what's going on with gender, male ego is definitely real
[15:36:41] <kuudes> they need more testosterone
[15:36:47] <adiabatty> what's the sex ratio of people you've dealt with in that capacity
[15:37:01] <act> probably about 50:50 tbh 
[15:37:20] <adiabatty> still believable
[15:37:36] <act> I work in the all women's scene sometimes but it is very small so I do most of my work in the mixed scene, where it's 95% male 
[15:40:42] <act> I have a sample of 70 players in my current trial, and we actually have 2 female tanks, 2 female DPS and 1 female support 
[15:40:58] <act> Multiple female coaches and analysts 
[15:41:25] <act> The best coach I ever worked with by FAR was a woman, and women are overrepresented among managers 
[15:41:42] <act> Team *management* is thankless work that tends not to get any prestige but is absolutely necessary and often the backbone of the team 
[15:43:14] <adiabatty> it's hard to see where the technē is in management from the outside
[15:43:58] <act> a lot of management skills are hard to define 
[15:44:15] <act> I ask a manager if I want a complicated scheduling spreadsheet arranged 
[15:44:55] <feep> competetive live managing
[15:45:36] <act> but the actual *good* managers are the ones where I can ask "we need a hitscan on Friday, do you know anyone good?" and they're like "yeah so-and-so is thinking about unretiring and is usually up for ringing Fridays, or you could ask this person who isn't happy on their current team and could be persuaded to move, or there's this up-and-coming player that an experienced coach vouched for"
[15:45:44] <act> like 
[15:45:53] <act> they're people who know everything about everyone 
[15:47:57] *** Joins: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage)
[15:49:00] <kuudes> management is a service job
[15:52:28] <act> it's a service job with some teeth but it's a service job yeah
[15:52:33] <act> very much out of the spotlight 
[15:53:21] <act> I attribute a lot of this to women being more willing to do things that other people don't want to do, but which benefit the team in some way, because that explains both why women are willing to play less-popular roles like support and why women are willing to take up management 
[15:54:21] <act> lots of people start by doing a role to help the team, then realise they're good at it and keep at it 
[15:55:18] <act> lots and lots of managers started because nobody else on their team was willing to book scrims, and lots of mercy players started because nobody else was willing to pick mercy, but if you do it for long enough then you start being quite good at it and you realise you don't want to change even when you *do* have the opportunity to do something else 
[15:56:10] <act> we really don't necessarily see the women=support thing at the highest level which I think is more evidence behind the idea that it's because support is accessible, though 
[15:56:20] <act> there's been one woman in the Overwatch League and she was a tank player 
[15:56:47] <adiabatty> anything's possible with a sample size of one
[15:57:17] <act> yeah, but like I said, I'm running a contenders trial at the moment (that's the level below OW league) and we're on 2 female tanks, 2 female DPS and 1 female support 
[15:57:53] <act> if I took a sample of 70 plats then I would not be at all surprised to find 65 men and 5 women, with 5 of the 5 women being supports 
[15:57:59] <act> but that doesn't extrapolate up to the high levels 
[15:59:51] *** Joins: janus__ (~janus__@86.106.121.34)
[16:00:31] <act> and the absolute best female Valorant players that I can think of are actually duelists
[16:00:47] <act> which is more analogous to a tank or carry dps role, and definitely not a support role 
[16:01:13] <adiabatty> Valorant's beyond me. I've only seen it played.

[20:04:35] <gwern> every single way you'd expect it to work based on the rest of twitter and the internet, it doesn't
[20:05:32] <gwern> I was *sure* that if I unprivated for a day or two, what would happen would be that all the pending follow requests would fire and then when I reprivated, the list would be empty and everyone would be on board.
[20:05:40] <gwern> because how would you design it any other way???
[20:06:08] <gwern> I gave it 35 hours+ and just reprivated and... the list is still there exactly as before
[20:06:14] <gwern> wtf
[20:06:42] <gwern> what this means is that there is *no* way whatsoever to accept large amounts of follow requests
[20:07:36] <linear> this is about what i'd expect from my short time using twitter

It’s a free country. No one should be putting someone at gunpoint, taking what they did earned and worked hard for. But in a growing epidemic of carjackings, people shouldn’t buy these cars. It’s like riding
[20:56:16] <feepbot> around with drugs, holding them in your window, right past the police. You’re asking for the police to pull you over. You’re asking for them to take you on a high-speed chase. Looking for trouble. So those cars — the Hellcats, the Trackhawks, your SRTs — why buy them if you know what the growing epidemic is right now? Q. But people who read this are going to say, “Look,
[20:56:16] <feepbot> here’s some guy who’s blaming the crime on the victim [or the car companies].” A. Well, don’t be a target. I’m not blaming the crime on the victim.
