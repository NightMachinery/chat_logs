[02:09:45] <PaulWay[w]> schinckel: do you know where the POST data is stored in the record?

[04:15:29] <PaulWay[w]> But the request object doesn't seem to have anything in request.POST or request.FILES and it doesn't have any attribute like request.data.
[04:16:18] <PaulWay[w]> request.body seems to be based on the record.request stream, so once it's read you can't rewind it because it's a generator.
[04:17:01] <PaulWay[w]> I've looked at all the attributes of the report and its request object and the thread request object and none of them seem to have the data that was POSTed to us.

[12:38:59] <pycode1> vlt, so basically a mixin with get_context_data
[12:39:15] <pycode1> and where you put all the data to pass to the template
[12:39:18] <pycode1> right?
[12:43:31] <pycode1> vlt, i am also thinking about inclusion tag where i can put the logic with its own template/design
[12:45:45] <pycode1> vlt, for example, lets suppose we have a box with "last 5 projects"
[12:46:00] <pycode1> and this box is called from different templates
[12:46:13] <pycode1> in this case i think an inclusion tag is better instead of loading thata inside mixin?
[12:46:38] <pycode1> so the question is how to undertsand when to use a TAG instead of loading all data inside the view class (get_context_data?
[12:58:47] <FunkyBob> the view... you just need o say 'view'
[12:59:48] <FunkyBob> pycode1: you'd use a tag when  the data is more general purpose... nopt specific to the view
[13:00:15] <pycode1> ok
[13:00:34] <pycode1> i will go with custom tag because as i said those a re "summaries"
[13:00:43] <pycode1> and i have seen that i can set the .html for the tag
[13:00:54] <pycode1> but, can i pass a different .html to render the tag?
[13:01:14] <pycode1> like
[13:01:29] <pycode1> {% my_tag "foo.html" %} {% my_tag "foo1.html" %}  {% my_tag "foo2.html" %}
[13:01:44] <pycode1> instead of setting a fixed .html during the registration of the tag?

[17:37:58] <pycode1> GinFuyou, i thought that creating custom inclusion tag were good to keep code dry instead of adding the summaries in the context of the requests...but yes it just the same, maybe a +1 for the tags is when we need to cache that part of the template instead of calling the function to execute .count() again and again
[17:38:09] <pycode1> but yes we can cache the result of a queryset too
[17:38:22] <pycode1> so there is no much difference
[17:43:06] <GinFuyou> That sounds that your code here is pretty highly coupled with model\view logic you have for your project. I don't see anything good in spreading logic further to tags here
[17:43:38] <GinFuyou> If it was something more abstract and general-purpose - sure tag start to make sense

[17:45:16] <hzm74> http://dpaste.org/U7fF
[17:46:59] <GinFuyou> well, why are you adding a datetime object?
[17:48:16] <GinFuyou> You need to create a new instance of Datum_Document, no need to use .add() here too
[17:50:07] <hzm74> because in the model it is an datetime object so i thought i need to add a datetime-object, not jus a string
[17:51:19] <apollo13> hzm74: you need to add a datetime, but inside the model
[17:51:23] <pycode1> GinFuyou, pardon for the stupid question but i have seen that people tend to use CBV, but whats wrong to use classic function instead... i am starting to follow some dev on twitter like Adam Johnson that says he use functions...so now i am asking myself when to use CBV Over functions
[17:51:31] <pycode1> maybe Adam is in this channel :D
[17:51:55] <apollo13> the easy answer is: when it makes sense ;)
[17:52:20] <apollo13> In general it depends, but often you don't win much by using class based views
[17:52:36] <GinFuyou> Absolutely nothing wrong
[17:52:42] <pycode1> apollo13, yes i am trying to understans WHEN it makes sense :) that's the problem
[17:53:03] <moldy> sometimes it's a matter of taste

[17:53:57] <hzm74> GinFuyou / apollo13: thnx, works now. Did this: dt2 = Datum_Document(datum='2022-01-24')
[17:53:57] <GinFuyou> Also CBVs spliting logic by methods also may help organizing code
[17:53:57] <hzm74>  ; dt2.save() ; v1.datum_document_set.add(dt2)
[17:54:07] <moldy> one factor is how familiar the people working on the code are with CBVs
[17:54:23] <GinFuyou> Yes, that's most important one
[17:54:41] <pycode1> yeah exactly for the moment i am using CBV just to organize the code better but maybe i really do not need them
[17:55:05] <moldy> if you have memorized all of http://ccbv.co.uk, CBVs are easy to read and debug. if you don't, not so much.
[17:55:12] <GinFuyou> hzm74, don't have to use .add() just create Datum_Document(datum=datetime(...), vloeren=v1)
[17:55:21] <apollo13> I am not sure how CBV organize code better unless you share a lot between them
[17:56:36] <GinFuyou> To me form_valid() form_invalid() is much easier to read then "if request.method == "POST" - if form.is_valid() - else - else "
[17:57:13] <pycode1> GinFuyou, in that case you use a function
[17:57:33] <pycode1> for_valid and form_invalid are method of the FormView
[17:57:36] *** Joins: DnzAtWrk (~DnzAtWrk@mobile-access-6df0a8-31.dhcp.inet.fi)
[17:57:53] <pycode1> if you use a function you have to check if POST and then check the form, you are saying that right?
[17:58:28] <pycode1> yeah i found them that sometimes the code seems more....redabled....but other times i need to investigate 10000 mixins that CBV are inherithing :D
[17:58:43] <pycode1> so maybe it is time to look back to classic functions :D
[17:59:05] <GinFuyou> Cases simply organized as methods look cleaner to me, just that. Reusing base class logic is also helpful
[17:59:15] <GinFuyou> But all what was said above
[17:59:56] <GinFuyou> If you are more comfortable with function - absolutely nothing wrong. Mixing both also fine
