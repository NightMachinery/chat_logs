[00:06:01] <KatrinValerie> I am a complete network noob asides from setting up some adhoc-lan bullshit
[00:06:09] <ButterNoodle> 1st
[00:06:24] <ButterNoodle> if ur behind a router, there's not a lot to worry about
[00:06:49] <ButterNoodle> a real router.. one that is doing filtering/firewalling
[00:06:51] <ButterNoodle> otherwise
[00:07:00] <ButterNoodle> u should run the most basic of firewall rules
[00:07:23] <ButterNoodle> deny by default and permit established
[00:07:29] <KatrinValerie> Mine does NAT
[00:07:33] <ButterNoodle> ur router
[00:07:37] <ButterNoodle> then ur fine
[00:07:37] <KatrinValerie> Yes
[00:07:48] <KatrinValerie> I found it in the streets and reflashed the firmware
[00:07:51] <ButterNoodle> u have a 1918 address in the inside
[00:08:10] <KatrinValerie> Yeah I got that LAN
[00:08:20] <ButterNoodle> someone would need to get through a nat translation to get direct access to u
[00:08:25] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: my ex still has my shiny new FritzBox q.q

[00:11:22] <ButterNoodle> I mean there are 0-days that come out for routers, but thats typically due to people leaving services open to the public
[00:11:23] <KatrinValerie> I would probably also install fail2ban
[00:11:43] <ButterNoodle> yea
[00:11:57] <KatrinValerie> And generally use an allow list approach

[00:19:27] <Bco1981> wut ?
[00:19:36] <ButterNoodle> its not internet if an ISP is natting
[00:19:37] <Bco1981> nat was a bandaid so that ISPs could keep running ipv4, true
[00:20:00] <KatrinValerie> NAT on internet sucks
[00:20:09] <ButterNoodle> nat was there for the boundary between public/private networks
[00:20:09] <KatrinValerie> It's not really internet then
[00:20:15] <KatrinValerie> It's whatever the ISP lets through
[00:20:28] <ButterNoodle> its not an ISP if they are using nat

[01:46:18] <amigojapan> Why would you tip a miner
[01:46:44] <Nanobot> amigojapan: Transaction fees.
[01:46:45] <Roey> miners do the stuff we don't wanna do
[01:46:58] <amigojapan> Roey: I have done atmega 328p and attiny85
[01:47:02] <Roey> (unless you meant minors, like <18)
[01:47:06] <Roey> amigojapan: oh cool cool
[01:47:28] <Roey> amigojapan: so those were tiny solutions, right? they had a tiny bit of RAM and flash storage for the program,
[01:47:39] <Roey> amigojapan: and pins connected to sensors?
[01:47:43] <Nanobot> Miners typically prioritize transactions by fees, so you pay them to get a better chance of getting your transaction approved earlier.
[01:47:54] <Roey> amigojapan: I'm realllly drawn to rp2040
[01:48:01] <Roey> amigojapan: just trying to find use cases for them
[01:48:06] <Nanobot> (and miners have basically no incentive to process transactions that pay 0 fees)

[02:21:32] <Roey> MootPoot: nice!

[02:50:38] <ButterNoodle> I dont get the flu shot because I get flu symptoms.. 
[02:50:43] <emmeka> the vaccine has effectiveness against omicron.
[02:50:49] <ButterNoodle> since when?
[02:50:56] <lastonestanding> you mean that my natural immunity (well, there is no immunity) is not worth anything?
[02:51:08] <ButterNoodle> everyone I know thats been vaccinated has had omicron
[02:51:17] <lastonestanding> same here

[02:51:59] <ButterNoodle> -has antibodies from first variant
[02:52:11] <emmeka> since any study of it has tried to measure it? the findings are consistent. the vaccine has reduced efficacy at preventing infection of omicron compared to previous strains, but it's still non-zero (in fact it's fairly significant), and what it *is* still good at is preventing serious symptoms in the infected.
[02:52:25] <emmeka> ButterNoodle antibodies + vax is even better, says science.
[02:52:29] <ButterNoodle> depends on what u read
[02:52:41] <emmeka> the bestest situation is if you've been infected *and* you get vaccinated. then you're fine.

[02:52:52] <ButterNoodle> yesterdays conspiracy is todays fact

[02:58:40] <emmeka> ButterNoodle no? this is what peer review is for.
[03:00:38] <emmeka> I mean even a cursory look at the literature should tell you this is true, it has been borne out by everyone who's attempted to parse the data. the vaccinated can get infected with omicron, but they are all else equal somewhat better protected against infection, and when they *do* get infected they are *way* less likely to develop severe symptoms, and more likely to get over the illness quickly.
[03:01:24] <lastonestanding> but in this case you cannot make it mandatory
[03:01:48] <lastonestanding> and how often do you want people to get the next shot? every 3 months?

[03:01:59] <emmeka> lastonestanding well, cannot, they are. I'm not in agreement with it.
[03:02:08] <Disconsented> Why is it "insane"?
[03:02:44] <emmeka> but the actual science of "do the vaccines work on omicron" is a different question from the political one of mandates etc
[03:02:47] <ButterNoodle> yea gir ur mark lastonestanding.. the fascist are coming to check ur papers - otherwise its off to the showers
[03:04:05] <Disconsented> Ah yes that fascism of a vaccine to to prevent health care collapsing and the death of millions, in a time which already has vaccine mandates commonplace without any real loss of freedom 
[03:04:20] <ButterNoodle> its not ur place - you are not qualified
[03:04:26] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: all I care is that tomako can get her shots, not about forcing other people, but she has not yet been able to get her booster shot
[03:04:30] <Disconsented> Its disgusting that you would equate genocide to a minor inconvenience 
[03:04:44] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: thank you for being a reasonable human being

[03:05:19] <ButterNoodle> there it is
[03:05:23] <Disconsented> Freedom comes with responsibilities
[03:05:37] <ButterNoodle> my vaccine only works when everyone else takes it
[03:05:40] <lastonestanding> Disconsented: millions? do you realize that millions actually die in africa, and not from covid
[03:05:47] <ButterNoodle> my mask only works when everyone else uses it
[03:05:51] <ButterNoodle> fascist
[03:06:03] <ButterNoodle> hope ur have a nice reaction o7
[03:06:14] <emmeka> alright everyone, let's have a cup of tea and chill out
[03:06:22] <ButterNoodle> :)
[03:06:24] <Disconsented> Its pretty clear you failed high school biology
[03:06:28] <ButterNoodle> lol
[03:06:32] <MootPoot> tbh want other people to wear masks - I dont want to look at other people's faces.
[03:06:34] <emmeka> vaccine needles beside the sugar bowl for anyone who wants them
[03:06:37] <ButterNoodle> pretty clear u didnt go to high school
[03:06:54] <MootPoot> When I come to power I will make it law - showing your face is equivalent to showing your genitals
[03:06:58] <ButterNoodle> doubt they have them in ur 3rd world cuntry
[03:07:07] <amigojapan> MootPoot: full face masks?
[03:07:11] <Disconsented> But please since you know so much about all of this, please explain how we've managed to eradicate measles
[03:07:20] <emmeka> MootPoot so hijabs but unisex?
[03:07:25] <MootPoot> emmeka: yes
[03:07:28] <ButterNoodle> an actual vaccine Disconsented
[03:07:32] <ButterNoodle> ?
[03:07:33] <MootPoot> everyone wears a burka
[03:07:48] <Disconsented> So why is AZ and other "Actual vaccines" not working then?
[03:07:49] <lastonestanding> lol
[03:07:52] <amigojapan> I wonder if MootPoot put me on ignore
[03:08:06] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I'm being chased by zombies
[03:08:09] <MootPoot> in a game
[03:08:18] <amigojapan> Ah ok MootPoot 
[03:08:27] <emmeka> Disconsented look this is a pointless conversation
[03:08:30] <beaky> are they zombie idols like in zombieland saga
[03:08:31] * Disconsented crickets
[03:08:35] <ButterNoodle> its ez to be confused when the actual definition of vaccine has changed.. and vaccines actually work to prevent the infection -and spread- of diseases
[03:08:46] <emmeka> the vaccine works and anyone who refuses to acknowledge this after all this time is not going to
[03:08:47] <ButterNoodle> its ok.. u didnt go to school
[03:08:51] <Disconsented> It does do that..
[03:09:13] <lastonestanding> emmeka: then why can you still get infected?
[03:09:17] <ButterNoodle> ^
[03:09:18] <ButterNoodle> lel
[03:09:25] <ButterNoodle> defies all logic
[03:09:32] <emmeka> lastonestanding because it has reduced but nonzero efficacy?
[03:09:47] <Disconsented> Because Coronavirus's mutate rapidly and this strain is the most infectious disease in recent history..
[03:09:48] <emmeka> why is that hard to understand.
[03:09:49] <ButterNoodle> lets get some break through measles
[03:10:13] <emmeka> are flu vaccines fake now too because they don't prevent 100% of influenza infections
[03:10:26] <Disconsented> ^
[03:10:36] <ButterNoodle> no they work on the strain of the flu they were made for..
[03:10:37] <lastonestanding> this was never claimed
[03:10:43] <emmeka> ButterNoodle incorrect
[03:10:46] <ButterNoodle> pls
[03:10:50] <ButterNoodle> keep reading
[03:10:52] <lastonestanding> that is why you get a flu vaccine every single year
[03:10:54] <emmeka> they work *occasionally* on the strain of flu they were made for
[03:11:03] <emmeka> but not always, and not with 100% efficacy
[03:11:27] <Urchin[emacs]> lastonestanding: it was always possible to be infected by covid, even if vaccinated, due to it tending to (among other things) infest the nose, which is not that easily accessed by your antibodies.
[03:11:28] <ButterNoodle> so why do you get them?
[03:11:28] <emmeka> and if you catch a strain of influenza it *wasn't* made for, it still has *some* efficacy
[03:11:31] <emmeka> but not as much.
[03:12:01] <emmeka> ButterNoodle because broadly speaking flu vaccination reduces influenza transmission in our society rather remarkably
[03:12:21] <emmeka> it doesn't eliminate it, it doesn't prevent infection completely
[03:12:23] <lastonestanding> Urchin[emacs]: exactly, but this was not communicated by the government or the pharma industry
[03:12:25] <ButterNoodle> I would say I think u people should stick to talking about anime.. but ur taste in that is shit also
[03:12:28] <ButterNoodle> !quote 2
[03:12:28] <ImoutoBot> ButterNoodle: (2 / 501) <B​utterNoodle> all anime is shit... but I like the taste
[03:12:46] <emmeka> but they do an alright enough job that if enough people get it, influenza deaths and severe illness rates plummet
[03:12:55] <Urchin[emacs]> lastonestanding: nasal infection isn't the one that kills, though
[03:13:00] <emmeka> ButterNoodle how dare you
[03:13:14] <lastonestanding> Urchin[emacs]: that is how it starts though
[03:13:20] <ButterNoodle> ur even worse emmeka... filthy dub watcher
[03:13:24] <emmeka> you can insult my science, my career, my wife... but my taste in anime!
[03:13:26] <lastonestanding> it enters through the air
[03:13:34] <emmeka> the nerve
[03:13:38] <ButterNoodle> :)
[03:14:03] * ButterNoodle puts on full PPE to not catch whatever emmeka has that allows him to watch dubs

[09:28:34] <S_T_A_N> I got a message from a girl on my facebook the other day. She was messaging me because she had seen something on my feed earlier. This was a picture of her getting fucked by another girl. I don't know why she was messaging me. She's one of my favorite girls on my feed. She's a tall brunette with tattoos all over her body with perfect tits and a tight ass. I've always loved her body. I love to look at her photos. And she was talking about her 
[09:28:34] <S_T_A_N> experience last night with another girl. She said they were both drunk and she fucked her on the couch. She said she wanted to see me so I told her I would love to watch. She said she was surprised at my reaction. And she said she was a little nervous but she wanted to see what it would be like. After I got home I messaged her asking if she could send me her name and number and I would answer her next time I knew her. She said she couldn't 
[09:28:35] <blink9> already found an interesting show
[09:28:35] <S_T_A_N> because she had to go to the bathroom and then she needed to talk to her boyfriend. I texted her right back and told her to let me know when she gets back. That was about 2 hours ago, she hasn't responded. I'm getting kind of impatient. So I'm going to have to wait a little bit.

[11:30:54] <Cryowolf> In trying to learn to draw, the best channel I stumbled upon so far as a 100% newbie is https://www.youtube.com/c/Swatches like this here video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBya_2GqIyM explained to me how to think about drawing, how to approach it etc. To try and get into the mindset of an artist. It didn't tell me to do something and so on like "Ok go do this and this, got it? good, practice this". Instead it taught me WHY it's

[11:34:40] <Cryowolf> I mean it's not very cold 
[11:34:41] <sentionics> it gets cold in the evenings and night
[11:34:44] <Cryowolf> but it's not warm
[11:35:01] <sentionics> it was cold during the day though, this is much warmer than it was
[11:35:02] <Cryowolf> summers I tend to use my AC 24/7
[11:35:17] <sentionics> it was like 30 C on most evenings/nights
[11:35:25] <sentionics> it's a lot warmer now
[11:35:32] <Cryowolf> cause the sun is on my apartment from 4:30 in the morning or so until 22:45 in the evening

[11:35:44] <Cryowolf> at around 25-28
[11:35:45] <Cryowolf> c
[11:35:52] <Cryowolf> so it heats it up good
[11:36:17] <sentionics> Cryowolf, I hear some places don't really need central air/heat
[11:36:46] <Cryowolf> depends how they're built
[11:37:00] <sentionics> and the climate
[11:37:07] <Cryowolf> in Spain they tend to build them white, very thick concrete + clay/ceramic
[11:37:27] <Cryowolf> with those very thick walls and white to reflect the light, it keeps cooler
[11:38:05] *** Joins: bsdbandit01 (~bsdbandit@172.58.189.46)
[11:38:05] <Cryowolf> some countries dig into the ground or walls on cliffs, cause the deeper down you get the cooler it gets
[11:38:30] <Cryowolf> a basement can if kept isolated, drop down to like 10 C in the middle of a 40 C summer

[11:41:23] <Cryowolf> you could just get a portable AC
[11:41:30] <Cryowolf> there's cheap ones out there
[11:41:48] <sentionics> the electricity consumption is rather high on those, yes?
[11:41:51] <Cryowolf> for my 18m2 bedroom I have a 200 euro AC and it keeps it at around 19-20 C when it's 30+ outside
[11:41:55] <sentionics> My central A/C is good enough
[11:42:05] <Cryowolf> it's about 1000kwh
[11:42:12] <Cryowolf> err
[11:42:14] <Cryowolf> 1kwh

[11:42:22] <Cryowolf> 1000w
[11:42:28] <sentionics> gonna get reallllll cold now! xD
[11:42:43] <Cryowolf> so for me that costs like 2 dollars a day if it runs 24/7
[11:42:50] <Cryowolf> but I turn it off on cooler days
[11:42:58] <sentionics> my a/c shall now run until I turn it off

[11:46:44] <sentionics> rather awful way to die actually
[11:46:51] <sentionics> freezing to death would be hell
[11:46:54] <Cryowolf> worst way to die is drowning
[11:46:55] *** Joins: noob42 (~noob@host-20-143.txhoash.houston.tx.us.clients.pavlovmedia.net)
[11:47:17] <Cryowolf> freezing you eventually get past the first stage of hypothermia which is when you stop shaking, then you start feeling tired and warm
[11:47:22] <sentionics> ah, not gonna argue that
[11:47:24] <Cryowolf> then you die
[11:47:46] <sentionics> drowning is much more immediate and extreme
[11:47:58] <Cryowolf> drowning is extremely painful
[11:48:43] <Cryowolf> your entire bodys nerves burn, your muscles all spasm and lock, your lungs cramp up and since there's no oxygen you have no energy to move
[11:48:46] <sentionics> ... scary stuff, you're reminding me of swimming practice when I was just starting as a kid.
[11:49:03] <sentionics> I maybe could kinda swim, but back then I was ok-ish. I want to think.
[11:49:27] <Cryowolf> even being burned alive isn't as painful because it's only immediately painful, then all your nerves are dead
[11:49:58] <sentionics> that's awful!!
[11:50:08] <Cryowolf> yeah it is
[11:50:18] <Cryowolf> but drowning is one of the worst ways to go
[11:50:41] <sentionics> I never thought of it like that. Wow.
[11:50:43] <Cryowolf> not including torture that is but that's different. That's not a way of dying, it's a way of staying alive to suffer
[11:51:03] <sentionics> Figured it was benign before other awful alternatives. Illness in mind.
[11:51:17] <Cryowolf> what was benign? drowning?
[11:51:55] <Cryowolf> if youre in a house fire though and cant get out and you're gonna be burned, chances are you won't feel it cause the smoke has suffocated you to unconsciousness
[11:52:36] <jessedesu_onaph> Wtf are we talking aboot
[11:52:39] <sentionics> Cryowolf, I figured drowning was not so bad. Well due to pirate movies and the like featuring drowning people a lot
[11:52:51] <sentionics> sorry jessedesu_onaph we're drowning
[11:52:57] <Cryowolf> yeah no, drowning is horrible

[11:56:23] <sentionics> she makes me happy
[11:56:25] <Cryowolf> a trap where different parts of your body is connected to a device that will turn seperate parts while keeping the rest locked down. So your arm is locked down at several points and your forearm is then turned, cracking the bone as it turn 360 degrees. then another part, then another. Then the legs. To get out of the trap, you have to bite down on a mouth piece that starts a tigersaw that slowly saws through your legs and you have to 
[11:56:25] <Cryowolf> keep biting down until it's all the way through to free yourself before the final turn occurs. Where the middle of your torso will be turned 360 degrees while the rest remains stationary
[11:56:31] <amigojapan> Jesse I had some kind of shellfish today in my food, but not oysters

[11:58:51] <Cryowolf> Another jigsaw trap would be where razorsharp wires have been surgically inserted into your arteries and throughout your body. If you fail to complete the task, they will snap out of your body, slicing you open from the inside of your main arteries. What do you do to free yourself?

[12:33:54] <Cryowolf> If you wanna get real. I have a lot of issues aside from my cancer. They' don't make dealing with it easier but I've taken the fatalist approach to it.

[12:51:50] <Cryowolf> I don't have a spleen so I need to get the occasional vaccination to maintain antibodies to serious diseases that would be trivial if I had a spleen.

[13:12:03] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, he might've had someone run after it and grab them after. Or it was his taxi
[13:12:16] <Cryowolf> and you don't know how much of what happened was staged
[13:12:25] <amigojapan> I see
[13:12:28] <Cryowolf> he might've told them all that was going to happen
[13:12:39] <amigojapan> Ok
[13:12:42] <Cryowolf> or he apologized after and bought another one
[13:12:50] <Cryowolf> so they made more money for the trouble
[13:13:10] <Cryowolf> Im not saying that's what happened, but it's very possible it was
[13:13:35] <Cryowolf> that the cab he put the fish on was his and one of his crew was in it, asked driver for permission, paid extra, cleaned where they placed it
[13:13:57] <Cryowolf> the pokemon ball in the basket of the Japanese cyclist though, that was real...Damn did he look pisse

[14:14:14] <Cryowolf> why does he go around fighting old people?
[14:14:40] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: probably cause it is polemical
[14:14:41] <Cryowolf> Bco1981, it is but my tv is 4k@120hz
[14:15:01] <Cryowolf> polemical?
[14:15:06] <Cryowolf> does that mean money?
[14:15:09] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: ah
[14:15:52] <Bco1981> i tought about replacing mine with a 120hz... but, that's the only reason. and i barely use my tv anyway.
[14:15:58] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: probably just appearing on YouTube don't this makes money even if he fails brutally
[14:16:33] <Cryowolf> he will make millions
[14:16:42] <amigojapan> Yup
[14:17:10] <amigojapan> Doing not don't*
[14:20:48] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: Japan is not allowing us to get the third shot yet...
[14:21:41] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: every person needs to wait for a ticket to arrive so they can get the vaccine
[14:22:24] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: I think they are doing people over 65 only again
[14:23:17] <Cryowolf> here they're sending out invites once 4-5 months have gone by, or was it 3-5? Depending on risk group
[14:24:09] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: tomako is high risk. But she had not gotten a ticket yet
[14:24:23] <amigojapan> Has not*
[14:25:04] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: first booster 3-4months is recommended now, but here in Germany you need to take action yourself to get vaccinated, hardly anyone gets an invite
[14:25:15] <KatrinValerie> Some GPs send out invites to at risk patients though.
[14:25:27] <KatrinValerie> Our GP invited my GF for vaccination.
[14:25:39] <Cryowolf> Im a risk patient so they're gonna send me an invite when its time
[14:25:49] <KatrinValerie> I should give him my files on my asthma, guess he don't even know I am an at risk patient
[14:26:35] <amigojapan> I have high blood pressure which is also apparently risky
[14:26:40] <KatrinValerie> Cryowolf: I have read that the booster only needs to be refreshed like after 9months, based on data from israel who rolled out the vaccines pretty quickly.
[14:26:58] <KatrinValerie> But who knows, the situation is dynamic
[14:27:09] <Cryowolf> I dunno, but I'll just go take it when they invite me
[14:27:19] <KatrinValerie> I personally look at the RKI recommendations from time to time
[14:27:22] <amigojapan> Me too
[14:27:27] <KatrinValerie> They are usually on top of the science
[14:27:36] <KatrinValerie> unlike the vaccination comission q.q
[14:28:14] <KatrinValerie> That comission drafts the recommendations for vaccination that most doctors rely on and they have always been months behind the research with their decisions.

[14:44:37] <Rue> they were athletes in high school (wrestling), so instead of being an social media idiot and making money that way.... they've found a way to use sports and their already existing fame into something that makes them money

[14:47:25] <Cryowolf> yeah
[14:47:37] <Cryowolf> they were on Vine and had some acting gigs
[14:47:41] <Cryowolf> Jake Paul was on Nikelodeon
[14:48:00] <Cryowolf> then they transitioned to youtube when vine shut down
[14:48:15] <KatrinValerie> Are we really gossiping about celebrities?
[14:48:23] <Rue> but people dont watch them fight because they are good boxers. it's because they are already famous ands kids have always watched them. then there's people that watch them because they want to see them get knocked out.... but when it comes to social media, there's no such thing as bad publicity. you want your fans and your haters to watch you just the same. because views, media attentions = money
[14:48:25] <Cryowolf> then they started doing some of the boxing stuff because it was a thing that youtubers were doing
[14:48:28] <Cryowolf> fighting each others

[16:28:34] <DunceCotus> its an important anime
[16:28:37] <ketchupicecream2> I watched it a year ago lol
[16:28:46] <DunceCotus> even if I think it could do with a bit of a remaster
[16:28:57] <DunceCotus> a lot of irritating repetition
[16:29:08] <tsukkin> anyone watching anything this season ?
[16:29:15] <ketchupicecream2> yeah the recap episode was a bit much

[16:30:04] <tsukkin> duncecotus yea we talked about it pretty sure

[16:30:53] <tsukkin> kept getting a couple of the girls mixed up until halfway through

[16:31:16] <ketchupicecream2> Interesting premise
[16:31:20] <DunceCotus> but I guess its about 'drifting'

[17:59:01] <ButterNoodle> not. she's under sedation
[17:59:39] <Terminus> well, sedation is different. was wondering if you can even be conscious while on the vent. bottom line though, as long as you're not a vegetable, there's a chance.
[18:00:19] <Terminus> if the lungs are destroyed though, no idea how you come back from that without being on some form of vent for the rest of your life.
[18:00:21] <ButterNoodle> u can be conscious, a lot of people freak out and need the sedation
[18:00:59] <ButterNoodle> true.. they arent handing out lung transplants - nor have I heard much about this

[18:03:41] <lastonestanding> no
[18:04:12] <lastonestanding> african countries have a much lower percentage, but a much younger population also
[18:04:17] <Terminus> amigojapan: i see ~10M boosters for japan. dunno how that compares to other countries.
[18:04:35] <lastonestanding> what matters is that the elder get the vaccination (same for the flu)
[18:05:24] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: younger people at risk should get priorety
[18:05:28] <Terminus> with ~8.24M boosters in the philippines, i think the govt is focusing on people getting boosters now instead of the people who still don't have a single shot.
[18:05:50] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: elders have lived most of their life anyway
[18:05:56] <lastonestanding> amigojapan: yes, but those are only a handful when compared
[18:06:19] <lastonestanding> especially in Japan since the obesity rate is very low
[18:06:26] <lastonestanding> different story in the US
[18:06:33] <Terminus> there's supposed to be another campaign to get more people vaccinated but at this point i think if people don't show up, then they can't do much about that.

[23:32:33] <DPA> I'm a day late with this, but it has to be said. Desks, specifically ones with wooden plates, are awesome! Anything can be put on the underside of them with ease! Velcro fasteners can be attached using an ordinary stapler, and devices can be put there with screws. (If they don't have holes it's possible to put some in a sheet of metal, and bend that into a suspension for any device).
[23:32:33] <DPA> I've an USB-C Dock with Ethernet & HDMI, a small amplifier, speakers, loudness controls, multiple USB-Switches, a Blu-Ray drive, a power strip, all the cables, and so on, all mounted below the desk. And my PC is a linux phone connected to the dock. It's awesome.
