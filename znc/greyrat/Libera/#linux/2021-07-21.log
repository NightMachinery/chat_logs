[00:02:23] <NthDegree> well their business model is to sell commercial versions under custom licences
[00:02:39] <NthDegree> but even Microsoft doesn't pay them AFAIK
[00:02:56] <bparker> they still (have to) have GPL/LGPL options though
[00:03:13] <bparker> and if they were to abandon it, KDE automatically takes it over
[00:03:26] *** Joins: oerheks (~OerHeks@ubuntu/member/oerheks)
[00:03:29] <NthDegree> that's the big issue for them, they're stuck with LGPL as an available option
[00:03:46] <NthDegree> if it was "GPL or pay" then they'd probably have more money coming in
[00:03:55] <bparker> which is probably why they got rid of offline builds and made the website harder to find the open source version
[00:04:13] <bparker> they want to sell more licenses

[00:04:21] <bparker> they're probably not making enough

[00:05:31] <NthDegree> if Microsoft can dance around paying for it using LGPL, what hope do they have getting anyone else to pay?
[00:05:49] <bparker> well yea
[00:05:58] <bparker> in 99% of cases they don't need to modify Qt anyway
[00:06:02] <bparker> so LGPL is fine

[01:14:46] <curdlesnoot> it's completely irrelevant, as concerns the find command that was shown. it _has_ to match names ending in ".txt" for deletion to occur, whether they be regular files or otherwise. dates don't even come into it.
[01:15:34] <ikonia> I've got dir1 in fstab, and dir2 in fstab, however dir2 needs a mountpoint in dir1 - that is ram also, how can I make sure there is a mountpoint in the tmpfs filesystem dir1 to allow dir2 tomount

[01:17:51] <DLange> having one inside the other is stupid, ikonia
[01:18:01] <DLange> you could just have the inside one be a directory

[01:18:25] <ikonia> DLange: yes, that's what I've just clicked on it - I can just use the directory in the first one, why mount over it
[01:18:29] <curdlesnoot> flughafen: the exact meaning of the command is to perform depth-first recursion then, for each dirent encountered, if it ends in ".txt", delete it. it's no more complicated than htat.

[01:18:56] <koollman_> although I do remember a 80s-like solution, using automount matching the right keys. But ... don't :)
[01:18:56] <flughafen> Yes.
[01:19:16] <curdlesnoot> flughafen: it cannot possibly match directories for which the -name '*.txt' predicate is not evaluated as true.

[08:23:08] <mlu> twainwek: that translates to 8Gbit/sec for 1x, 64Gbit/s for 8x
[08:23:15] <mlu> yes
[08:23:39] <mlu> twainwek: but be aware that it's technically a little under that since it's in 130b128 encoding (there's two parity bits for every 128 bits)
[08:23:46] <twainwek> and usb cable can do 8Gb/s?
[08:23:59] <mlu> twainwek: not exactly, but generally yes
[08:24:11] <mlu> USB 3.0 is desinged to do 5Gbit/s
[08:24:24] <mlu> you push it over a little (and hope your cables are shorter) -- the 8Gbit works fine

[08:25:20] <mlu> you'd be fearing that the computer would randomly catch on fire and wondering why it even works

[08:25:41] <mlu> twainwek: it's only 1x on the other side too
[08:25:53] <twainwek> oh
[08:25:54] <mlu> twainwek: The faster chips are usually much more expensive
[08:26:05] <twainwek> so it's like a pcie switch

[14:09:36] <Sauvin> Jeebus. Yeah, for that, you'll also want some means of making sure file(s) got downloaded properly.
[14:09:49] <solenia> Sauvin: hmmmm
[14:10:05] <Sauvin> As for wget, the suggestion somebody else made was to set up a simple web site, with authentication.
[14:10:29] <esselfe> solenia: with the wget way you would need a web server on your machine and give them an URL like http://172.18.0.128/largefile.dat
[14:10:46] <esselfe> I'd say it's way more complicated than splitting the files
[14:11:23] <solenia> esselfe: hmmm      ok if i split the file into 10GBs each so that is arouns 100 files     how do i send 10GB files?
[14:11:46] <MrElendig> torrent is quite nice for large files, though it do add some bw overhead
[14:12:04] <Sauvin> Do you trust the people you're sending the file(s) to?

[14:20:26] <curdlesnoot> honestly, bittorrent wasn't a bad idea. qtBittorrent has an embedded tracker. technically, if a stranger happened to know your IP address, that you were running a tracker, the ports that were in use and the resources that were available, they could get in on the action. that may or may not be a concern.

[16:15:50] <ZenixOwler> question, SSH is fascinating to me how it can replicate a fully interactive shell from the other end where everything can be done unlike netcat or nc which will break if i do something like using nano or just simply pinging tho, i mean how is SSH able to do so >
[16:16:56] <ayecee> break how
[16:17:24] <ZenixOwler> it will most likely to stop responding tho, like when you try to do -e /bin/bash or -e /bin/sh with nc, but SSH won't break
[16:17:36] <ZenixOwler> it will give me the full interface of the monitor and do real-time edit

[16:18:11] <ayecee> ZenixOwler: what happens when you do that

[18:16:12] <stevessss> wan is inherantly higher latency than lan and less suitable for direct nfs... 1 server per network with unison syncing the server is a few times redundancy but not rediculously high and provides off-site backup

[18:19:55] *** Joins: delta23 (~delta23@user/delta23)

[18:20:43] <Dagmar> It just doesn't monitor inotify, although someone could easily tie the two together
[18:20:45] <stevessss> unison can copy remote->local or local->remote depending which is newer if they are different

[18:38:57] <slackadelic> right
[18:39:09] <slackadelic> If you dont' have that there, you have to literally put rules in for anything and everything
[18:39:42] <hexnewbie> Gustavo6046: That depends on what rule exactly, and what the remaining rules are. You normally want a stateful firewall. A stateless firewall won't track connections, thus you'd have to explicitly allow packets in both directions.

[22:14:21] <Psi-Jack> 4GB is indeed the limitations of 32-bit.
[22:14:24] <curdlesnoot> whomst: that's right. it is.
[22:14:33] <koollman_> moha: but, anyway, ntpd is a full ntp server
[22:14:33] <blackgatonegro> Me too even on Linux there is a ram limit on 32 bits
[22:14:40] <NthDegree> XP had PAE enabled to provide NX, so it was always possible.  Server 2003 even had the limit unlocked by default and there was a community patch to make XP address more than 4GB RAM by removing the licence limitation
[22:14:50] <Psi-Jack> PAE doesn't "solve" it, but it works around it, but you can still only allocate and simaltaneously address 4 GB RAM at one time.

[22:16:42] <akik> 32-bit has a limit per process. the server still can have more memory
[22:17:04] <blackgatonegro> Anyway, does it really matter?
[22:17:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah, 32-bit had addressing problems, but 64-bit laptops are often limited to strange counts like 8 or 12GB.

[23:15:00] <koollman_> btrfs is nice and it exist, sure. Documentation still actively warns against raid5/6 usage. quota handle on subvolume is awful. And there's no zvol equivalent (but that's not too bad). Bonus: offline deduplication. malus: offline deduplication sometimes reduplicate (like when defragmenting) which leads to interesting troubles

[23:59:05] <SpeakerToMeat> greatcoof, raid is a process of dividing/copying data in multiple disks at once for different reasons, most notably getting more data resiliency (being able to lose drives to malfunction without losign the data), though some people consider it a failproof system and it's not
