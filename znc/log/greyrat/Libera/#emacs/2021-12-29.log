[05:09:24] <bpalmer> For example, in bash, you can set things in a .profile or a .bashrc depending on whether it should be for login shells or not ; if you run emacs from systemd or from a dock, you can control what command it runs and thus whether it runs under a shell.
[05:12:17] <mns> bpalmer: emacs I am using is from emacsfromacosx.com and that uses a ruby script behind the icon in the dock

[23:47:40] <mooseball> is there a way to make emacs release memory if garbage-collect doesn't work? i have an issue with a package i'm working on: when it can't connect to a server via url.el, memory slowly creeps up to lock up the OS. if the operation is cancelled ealier, you can prevent the lock up, but emacs won't release the few GB of memory it is holding on to. (i
[23:47:40] <mooseball> have seen a similar but prob different issue with pdf-tools, on zooming in a lot.)
[23:48:42] <Oaks> CyberShadow: Running clang-format direct does not work. It must run under the llvm-toolset-7.0 enviroment. Pointing clang-format-executable to a script helps.
[23:48:56] <Oaks> However, the arguments do not get passed correctly.
[23:49:14] <CyberShadow> In your script, make sure to add "$@" when passing execution to clang-format.
[23:49:32] <CyberShadow> (quotes included)
[23:50:08] <Oaks> `scl enable llvm-toolset-7.0 "clang-format $@"` fails
[23:50:13] <pjb> mooseball: (kill-emacs) will release the memory.
[23:50:19] <CyberShadow> mooseball: Like not due to fragmentation
[23:51:01] <CyberShadow> Oaks: I don't know what scl does exactly, but either way that doesn't look right.
[23:51:44] <mooseball> *without killing emacs...
[23:51:44] <CyberShadow> OK, looking at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_software_collections/3/html/packaging_guide/sect-enabling_the_software_collection it looks like it takes a shell command

[23:55:27] <qorg11> Is there any completion package for raku?
[23:55:57] <CyberShadow> In your script, you get the arguments in (to simplify) an array. However, scl takes a single string. To convert the array into a string, you have to perform the reverse operation of shell argument splitting / expansion. printf %q quotes special characters, and thus allows doing that.
[23:57:11] <Oaks> That is so smart. Thanks!
