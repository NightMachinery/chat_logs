[00:05:07] <paulo_> defragmentation in RAM allows for bigger contigous blocks of free memory
[00:05:32] <GeDaMo> Some machines don't get shutdown
[00:05:36] <GeDaMo> Unless they're on fire :|
[00:05:42] <teut> there is  a Defragmenter in  in Windows
[00:05:49] <InPhase> teut: Also, fragmented memory allocation results in processes holding on to more memory than they're actually using.  But usually people are mostly concerned about cache performance.
[00:06:00] <InPhase> teut: The Windows defragmenter is for filesystems though.

[00:07:19] <Izem> restarts should not be a big deal
[00:07:38] <InPhase> teut: FAT32 placed new files starting in the next available open space.  Smart filesystem designs (e.g., ext2, ext3, ext4) place the next file in a random location, so each file is statistically likely to be contiguous with a deletion/add sequence.
[00:07:48] <teut> yes, reading of data is done in 64 bits on x64
[00:08:18] <GeDaMo> Izem: I was mainly kidding but some machines are running continuously so you can't rely on shutting down to defragment memory
[00:08:31] <Izem> oh ok
[00:08:51] <teut> yes, I have some idea of that InPhase, thanks for reminding
[00:09:44] <pikapika> teut, today ram doesn't need defragmentation because of paging

[00:10:34] <teut> ya, I have heard the word "page" in ram, but I forgot what was it, I will need to grab my book back
[00:10:34] <ehnet3d> data is grouped in the same area, unless the stack is monsterous

[00:11:27] <teut> Uploaded file: https://uploads.kiwiirc.com/files/e173b240b5a7eb11c9c2caf69fa6e12a/image.png
[00:11:28] <pikapika> Physical memory is segmented into pages and virtual addresses are mapped to real pages via a number of schemes
[00:11:32] <teut> is this that page?
[00:12:00] <pikapika> So a request for a certain amount of memory can be fulfilled with pages that are non-contiguous in physical memory
[00:12:25] <pikapika> But the virtual address assigned is continuous
[00:12:35] <pikapika> This avoids the fragmentation problem
[00:12:43] <teut> if its a stack, addresses need to be continuous
[00:13:07] <pikapika> teut, continuous in the virtual address space, of which each page could be mapped to any page in physical memory
[00:13:14] <pikapika> that need not be contiguous
[00:13:41] <Izem> I see, but there is still fragmentation in virtual memory?
[00:13:55] <teut> ok, I ll need to refresh some parts of my knowledge
[00:14:04] <InPhase> Izem: The cache will grab a chunk of memory when you request one thing, under an assumption you're going to access a bunch of neighboring stuff.  You win on performance when you satisfy that assumption, because it doesn't need to load more across the slower RAM bus.
[00:14:10] <pikapika> with this scheme, the "worst" fragmentation would be approximately one page block
[00:14:45] <pikapika> these are all in theory of course. Modern operating systems and hardware could be doing far more complex stuff.

[00:19:10] *** immibis__ is now known as immibis
[00:19:13] <teut> so the stack frame that was required , was divided into chunks of 6 instructions and that is called a page
[00:19:27] <pikapika> and a subset of its results can be saved in a faster place
[00:19:39] <teut> now the page is put at random locations inside the ram

[01:20:10] <pikapika> And C makes efficient use of registers
[01:20:18] <pikapika> Therefore C is very good at handling hierarchical memory
[01:20:37] <Izem> wonder what the alternate universe looks like where lisp became the big language
[01:20:51] <Izem> cause it's very cache unfriendly
[01:20:55] <pikapika> If existence of a few kb of fast cache means the memory is now practically hierarchical, then I can easily go the next step and claim registers also indicate the same
[01:21:02] <oldlaptop> C doesn't "make use" of registers, it provides no means whatsoever to program them. (despite having a 'register' keyword, no less)
[01:21:17] <pikapika> You are free to write asm, inline or otherwise
[01:21:28] <pikapika> Most people these days are unable to beat the C compilers
[01:21:38] <pikapika> and when it makes sense and they can, they use inline asm
[01:22:04] <pikapika> Therefore asm is the most hierarchical friendly langauge, and everything you said is moot

[01:27:20] <pyzozord> I don't think the fact that C had a flat memory is the only fact machines today pretend to have flat memory. Actually I don't even think it was a major argument. I think the major argument is the predictive execution or whatever the term was. Many thing are annoying or difficult to write explicitly parallel

[01:29:14] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: my point is, I don't think it's about language memory models at all, it's about humans being able to reason better about imperative code
[01:29:15] <oldlaptop> one wonders if itanic would have flopped as hard as it did if people actually wrote explicitly parallel programs for it, instead of expecting magic compilers to do so (besides the obvious answer of "yes of course it would, they wouldn't be able to run all their old ia32 serial programs")
[01:29:28] <pikapika> pyzozord, no language in the world would have helped
[01:29:32] <pikapika> His argument is complete horseshit

[01:30:25] <pikapika> I will just say if the existence of a few kb or single digit mb of cache memory makes a system hierarchical memory, then I can easily claim the existence of registers implies hierarchical memory. And most languages are using and dealing with registers perfectly fine.
[01:30:28] <pikapika> pyzozord
[01:31:29] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: I agree but they do only specific tasks, that are highly parallelizable, imo they won't work as CPUs
[01:32:31] <oldlaptop> that's mainly the parallel part, I think

[01:35:52] <pyzozord> oldlaptop: my point was is that the caches are direct result of optimizing imperative execution by making it out of order execution). The cache hierarchies are direct result of cpu designers making things look serial and doing all kinds of extra gymnastics behind the scene with out-of-order execution to make it run faster, with things like branch predictions etc.
[01:36:13] <pikapika> He won't answer anything, he has no answers
[01:36:44] <W> backwards compatibility *is* king, of course, which is why you probably have to work on the compatibility layer even before the hardware, if you want to drastically change things
[01:37:02] <oldlaptop> the reasons for cache hierarchies exist independently from the reasons for opportunistic parallelism; GPUs have explicit parallelism, and explicit memory hierarchy

[05:17:48] <Guest59> AlexDelarge: they said its outside scope of git
[05:20:53] <AlexDelarge> good luck
[05:21:29] <arahael> Yeah, it is indeed outside the scope of git.
[05:21:37] <src> is it just me or is it a weird question to want a generic answer too
[05:21:51] <src> clone the repository and then it depends on what specifically we're talking about? o_O
[05:21:59] <src> s/too/to
[05:22:00] <arahael> src: Right.
[05:22:42] <oldlaptop> src: Clone the repository, then do a bunch of stuff.
[05:22:55] <Guest59> ok thanks guess ill program a generic solution myself that I can easily reuse for specific languages ...lol

[05:23:30] <oldlaptop> It's not that, so much as that everything you will need to do depends completely on the "language/package manager"

[05:24:19] <oldlaptop> (or, in its absence, likely on whatever build system the author chose)

[12:30:51] <archie> password looks like I've found the issue: https://github.com/nlohmann/json#tofrom-strings

[12:32:49] <password> archie you need an library that interprets it for you and returns an c++ object
[12:33:33] <password> somehting like this https://rapidjson.org/
[12:33:41] <archie> password this library does exactly that, the problem is the _json suffix. I can do "json string here"_json but can't do variable_json
[12:33:43] <vdamewood> password: The links archie keeps using are to such a library.
[12:34:07] <password> oh lol , indeed it is
[12:34:20] <password> i should read D:
[12:34:35] <archie> that's the only issue: how can I use such a suffix if the string is stored in a variable?
[12:35:05] <vdamewood> You don't. The library should provide a constructor for it's JSON object that takes a string as input.
[12:35:42] <Valware> https://github.com/DalekIRC/Dalek-Services if anyone would like to collabor8 that would be gr8 m8
[12:36:15] <vdamewood> archie: If you scroll a little down from to/from strings, you'll se mention of the parse method.
[12:36:53] <password> you can call  :  json::parse()
[12:36:55] <archie> vdamewood I tried the parse method, but it doesn't work either
[12:37:18] <vdamewood> archie: What happens when you use parse?
[12:37:55] <archie> vdamewood the json remains a string, I guess it's probably due to the fact I can't prefix it with R
[12:38:19] <archie> vdamewood the above error appears using the parse method
[12:38:33] <vdamewood> archie: You mean you have a string str, and when you use json::parse(str), then str is still a string?
[12:39:09] <vdamewood> make that json::parse
[12:39:25] <vdamewood> oh, it was, nevermind the correction.
[12:40:34] <archie> vdamewood if you look at the examples you'll see it does R"json written here"
[12:40:47] <vdamewood> archie: Yeah, ignore that.
[12:41:06] <archie> vdamewood the problem is that I do have data = "this is the json" and I can't do R(data) or something like that (same issue with the _json suffix method)
[12:41:08] <archie> :(
[12:41:15] <vdamewood> archie: If you have a string variable, then the R thing is completely irrelevant to what you're doing.
[12:41:58] <vdamewood> The R thing is only even USEFUL for string literals. It doesn't do anything useful for passing a string value to this JSON library.

[14:36:32] <GeDaMo> The CPU tells the device to transfer data to an area of memory then the device does the transfer directly

[17:44:21] <arahael> mrig: i hate how everything these days comes with LEDs. :(
[17:44:35] <pulse> i specifically built my computer to be as LED free as possible
[17:44:48] <pulse> the mouse is the only thing with RGB and that's permanently turned off :p
[17:45:29] <arahael> pulse: mine too.  my motherboard has multicoloured LED's (WTAF!?) but i made sure they can be disabled.
[17:46:04] <pulse> my motherboard only has a tiny white LED on the audio bridge
[17:46:12] <pulse> can't be turned off but it's barely visible anyway
[17:46:23] <arahael> pulse: you could probably paint it.
[17:46:36] <pulse> the graphic card covers most of it anyway
[17:46:44] <PlanckWalk> My computer's case is opaque and black, and the external LEDs consist of a single white power LED (and a tiny LED on the network socket at the back)
[17:47:02] <arahael> fair enough.  actually paint is problematic as it makes the led hotter but even so.
[17:47:14] <arahael> PlanckWalk: yeah i cover that shit.
[17:47:16] <PlanckWalk> Sometimes I cover up the power LED
[17:47:20] <pyzozord> that rgb fad in pc computers is really silly :D

[17:48:27] <PlanckWalk> Yep, I like that
[17:48:39] <mrig> I used to have my computers in another room with cables through the walls to the monitors and input devices, that was awesome, not a sound nor light from them!
[17:48:56] <pulse> i thought about that, i opted for building extremely quiet PCs instead
[17:49:00] <pulse> after a while you know exactly what to do
[17:49:17] <mrig> arahael: It is indeed, there is such wonder in the night skys when you can see them, such a shame that they are all blotted out.
[17:49:20] <arahael> computers today are crazy fast.
[17:49:23] <pulse> big fans + as many of them as possible + quiet case = nice
[17:49:34] <pulse> you would expect that more fans = more noise but nope
[17:49:36] <pulse> more fans = more quiet
[17:49:53] <pulse> cause each can spin significantly slower to get the same effect
[17:50:02] <arahael> pulse: big+slow fans.
[17:50:06] <arahael> yep
[17:50:08] <pulse> arahael, yes
[17:50:15] <pulse> small fans = noise
[17:50:17] <pulse> fast fans = noise
[17:50:29] <pulse> big, slow fans = quiet
[17:50:33] <mrig> yes computers are awesome things, Babbage would be grinning from ear to ear.
[17:50:44] <pulse> Babbage would get an Android phone
[17:50:54] <arahael> another reason mac laptops are good, althouh i'm deaf and can't hear the fans i still feel self concious about them.
[17:51:12] <mrig> above all much more precise than humans at calculating, when not being optimized by humans that is :D

[17:52:38] <pulse> arahael, i had tinnitus for the past year or so and figured out a seemingly magic cure
[17:52:44] * mrig takes it all back.
[17:52:56] <mrig> arahael: how do you cope with that?
[17:53:02] <pulse> a drop of tea tree oil in the ears somehow negates it almost 100%
[17:53:25] <mrig> did not sleep again until about 6 after being woken, it was horrible :|
[17:53:39] <arahael> mrig: i've learned to live wih it, thouh i almost considered antidepressants just for the possible side effect that it sometimes reduces tinnitus.
[17:53:42] <pulse> but there's more than one cause for tinnitus, i probably have some milder form
[17:53:55] <arahael> pulse: wouldnt do a trick for me. you definitely have a milder form.
[17:54:09] <pulse> yep, most likely. it usually comes in the evening, and coffee seems to trigger it

[19:03:19] <mrig> as important as.
[19:03:34] <mrig> choice of script being the most obvious example of this.
[19:03:38] <pulse> if you had to use gmail for 3 days as plaintext you'd soon change your mind
[19:03:51] <InPhase> pulse: A good website prioritizes useful first, and beautiful second.
[19:04:12] <mrig> how visually easy something is to interpret depends upon how it is formed.
[19:04:17] <pulse> they're both equally important InPhase

[19:04:22] <InPhase> pulse: They're really not.
[19:04:35] <pulse> well, the way you phrased it maybe

[19:05:05] <mrig> InPhase: the simplicity was the aesthetic.
[19:05:18] <xerxes> InPhase: Craigslist too.
[19:05:19] <InPhase> pulse: But it just worked better than everyone else's, so billions.  On the other hand you have tons of companies with beautiful pages that have no content and barely work.  And we've all experienced where we go to such pages for things, and then we just give up and buy from someone else.
[19:05:20] <pulse> like shape and color, usability and looks go hand in hand
[19:05:45] <mrig> design that is all facade is empty that is clear.
[19:05:51] <pulse> InPhase, well, a site that looks good will retain (and attract) more people
[19:06:01] <pulse> try shipping the same game with a barebones site or a well designed one
[19:06:06] <InPhase> pulse: So if EVER you had to choose between useful and beautiful, you should choose useful or you lose business.
[19:06:08] <mrig> but not the same as design that is meaningful and well considered.
[19:06:11] <xerxes> InPhase: but in my experience, it has been difficult to find examples where interface is beautiful but the site doesn't work.
[19:06:26] <InPhase> xerxes: I find this all the time...  ALL the time.
[19:06:32] <pulse> InPhase, idk, i still think both are important. UX isn't just usability, otherwise we'd punch requests into computer with 1s and 0s

[19:06:51] *** Joins: img (~img@user/img)
[19:07:02] <mrig> it is what you muster to get away with poor design.
[19:07:04] <pulse> how things look may be secondary, but humans are visual creatures
[19:07:16] <xerxes> InPhase: can you give some (in)famous examples?
[19:07:16] <mrig> it is not good design, not to my mind anyhow.
[19:07:19] <pulse> you know how when you have 2 items in the store, one is branded and the other plain, 70% go to buy branded?
[19:07:39] <pulse> or how if you go buy a VCR you will buy the nice looking one :p
[19:07:43] <pulse> ok maybe not VCR anymore
[19:07:47] <pulse> but you get my drift
[19:07:56] <pulse> humans like things that look nice
[19:08:06] <InPhase> xerxes: Not off the top of my head.  I close those windows with spite and try hard to forget those places exist.  But I'll hit such sites multiple times per month.
[19:08:13] <mrig> Looks are only one of many aspects that go into aesthetic though.
[19:08:14] <pulse> i mean look at supercars
[19:08:30] <pulse> what do you prefer, a brand new ferrari or the same engine, same everything but just the chasse :D
[19:08:42] <pulse> you'd have to be crazy not to pick the ferrari
[19:08:55] <xerxes> InPhase: i too encounter them. but i've never seen a really beautiful design coupled with very bad performance.
[19:08:58] <mrig> ultimately from Greek aisthetikos "of or for perception by the senses, perceptive," of things, "perceptible," from aisthanesthai "to perceive (by the senses or by the mind), to feel," from PIE *awis-dh-yo-, from root *au- "to perceive."
[19:09:08] <mrig> this is not about how something looks.
[19:09:14] <mrig> that is a tiny part of it.
[19:10:01] <xerxes> InPhase: my point is, if the site has paid enough attention to design, it probably has good engineers to pay enough attention to performance too.
[19:10:08] <mrig> If something looks great but using it drives you crazy, then it is not aesthetically pleasing.
[19:11:12] <InPhase> xerxes: So the primary reason this happens is because sites, while aiming for beauty, will go heavy on the javascript, which then introduces bugs that they inadequately manage.  So you'll have major components of the site which simply won't navigate or do what it says on the label.

[19:11:36] <pulse> i agree that if you have a site that is all looks and no substance that's awful
[19:12:09] <InPhase> xerxes: And this is because at some point they put more time and attention into appearance than into engineering competence.
[19:12:11] <pulse> if you have a site that's all substance and no looks - it's still awful. it may work, and satisfy programmers and techies, but to normal people it would be borderline useless
[19:12:13] <pulse> presentation is important
[19:12:17] <mrig> pulse: humans are not visual creatures, some cultures are more visually oriented than other.
[19:12:37] <mrig> human vision is pretty poor compared with some other animals too.

[19:12:47] <pulse> mrig, maybe, but with interfaces we don't have much choice
[19:12:53] <pulse> we can't use any other senses except sound
[19:13:01] <mrig> we are omnivore all rounders, natures scavengers really.
[19:13:08] <xerxes> InPhase: if a site has really good design, it *would* achieve it without spraying JavaScript all over.
[19:13:36] <InPhase> xerxes: There is also an accessibility issue requiring addressing.  Many sites go "pretty" by doing an image-focused site, which without accommodations then becomes unusable to visually impaired people.
[19:13:47] <mrig> pulse: sound is really important for games.
[19:13:49] <xerxes> InPhase: i'll give you an example.
[19:13:54] <mrig> less so for web of course.
[19:14:11] <mrig> sound brings really immersion instantly.
[19:14:40] <mrig> real rather.
[19:15:06] <InPhase> xerxes: It is desireable for accessibility to have major content and navigation be in text form, with images used for a visual augment.  Or if there are images as the centerpiece, keeping alt-texts in place and properly working.  But sometimes that falls apart with the fancier javascript-driven picture-oriented-navigation sites.
[19:15:45] <mrig> The mouse is the cause of this.
[19:15:55] <mrig> over dependence upon it.
[19:16:06] <mrig> I think, anyhow.
[19:16:23] <mrig> mouse being visually driven of course.
[19:16:37] <InPhase> mrig: And then it got worse when sites became touch-interface oriented.  :)
[19:17:03] <xerxes> InPhase: i agree. text-based design should be the norm. if that's the criteria you use to see which sites are good looking and better performing, you won't find many out there. it's not the norm on which the industry functions, unfortunately i should add. i learnt to live with Elinks to surf the web for that exact reason.
[19:17:04] <pulse> mrig, pure audial (i think that's how they're called) interfaces are a thing too
[19:17:29] <InPhase> The modern-style vertical scroll image frame sites tend to be much harder to find useful content on.  It's like looking at an ad brochure, when you really wanted informative content.
[19:17:52] <pulse> text-only would be very offputting for most people
[19:18:02] <pulse> programmers tend to forget that they represent less than 0.1% of total users
[19:18:19] <xerxes> pulse: but they are 100% of the total makers, right.
[19:18:27] <pulse> sure, but that spells bad marketing
[19:18:27] <InPhase> pulse: Well I am all behind improving literacy so that this is less true.
[19:18:28] <mrig> InPhase: oh yes of course, I'm quit out of touch with that literally, not having a smartphone or any such device.
[19:18:40] <pulse> i work for a marketing firm and i can tell you the hoops we go through just to retain attention of an average user for 0.1 seconds more
[19:18:42] <pulse> it's not trivial
[19:18:52] <mrig> pulse: I'd be intrigued to learn a little more about these.
[19:18:56] <pulse> any subtle animation helps
[19:19:15] <mrig> Using a logical system for menus would be a massive aide.
[19:19:15] <pulse> people tend to like seeing things naturally and beautifully move/reveal
[19:19:23] <pulse> of course you have to be subtle enough with it
[19:19:27] <mrig> it is used as a memory device in aural traditions.
[19:19:31] <pulse> (which only makes it harder to do right)
[19:19:34] <mrig> for navigating texts.
[19:19:51] <pulse> mrig, pretty sure the military uses those in various contexts
[19:19:53] <InPhase> pulse: In the meantime I go to a site describing a product, and I spend more time there just because I can't find what I'm looking for.  I might clock in as having spent more time, but then I'm less likely to actually buy it.

[19:22:48] <InPhase> pulse: I think sites should not be visually repelling, but I reference again the success of google.  I don't know if you're old enough to remember the early days of google.com, but this was an extremely simple layout through most of their growth.  It's a "little" fancier now, but really, it's still extremely barebones compared to most of the web.  Yet it is the most important site in existence, and

[19:23:15] <pulse> InPhase, i do remember but it's a false equivalency because the web itself was evolving back then
[19:23:19] <Lyn> pulse do you have any recommendations where I could learn more about getting a user to use and/or pay
[19:23:30] <pulse> and google has since upped their design game to the point where it's a defacto standard on how to do things
[19:23:46] <pulse> everything from maps to gmail to gdocs, they're all functional and beautiful, for the most part
[19:23:51] <InPhase> pulse: By preferencing usability and engineering over glitter, google built up a powerful reputation of utility that competitors can't seem to get an edge over.

[21:17:45] <pyzozord> sandman13: yeah apparently it's just a matter of knowing and groking enough algorithms, and most likely you are not supposed to reinvent the algorithms from scratch on time.

[21:23:42] <pyzozord> that is true. What if find for changings requiremenst IRL is helpful is being very mindful of imports/includes, that go's slogan "little copy is better than little dependency" really goes long way

[22:58:52] <alycidyne> Hello, why are there so many layout engines? e.g. GUIs use one layout system, CSS uses another, TeX another, etc. when, basically, displaying anything is basically plotting
[23:00:08] <pyzozord> alycidyne: same reasons there are bicycles, cars, trains and airplanes

[23:00:22] <GeDaMo> We still don't know how to write computer programs :P
[23:01:03] <pulse> alycidyne, turns out layouting is a hard problem
[23:01:08] <alycidyne> pyzozord: piloting a bicycle is not the same task as piloting a plane. Laying out a GUI is the same task as laying out a page. So I don't consider that a really good explanation...

[23:05:01] <pyzozord> well maybe i should say three dimentional space
[23:05:48] <alycidyne> pyzozord: but there aren't different ways of dividing a 2D space in the same way there are different ways of propelling oneself
[23:06:05] <pulse> in theory
[23:06:12] <alycidyne> Any region of 2D space is a quadrilateral, be it a page, a footer, a div, a button or a window
[23:06:15] <pulse> but in theory, practice and theory are the same
[23:06:23] <pulse> implementations get messy without exceptions
[23:06:24] <GeDaMo> What about overlapping items?

[23:06:35] <pyzozord> alycidyne: oh but there are you can aribrarly simple or complex rules to divide the space
[23:06:43] <pulse> layouting is a ridiculously hard problem. i know, i've implemented several UI engines from ground up
[23:06:53] <mrig> until that is, that that 2d space is spherical ...

[23:07:02] <alycidyne> GeDaMo: they just... overlap. Nothing more. Rendering is where occlusion comes in, but until then, we're just dealing with figures

[23:09:01] <pulse> alycidyne, it's tightly intertwined
[23:09:11] <pulse> if your layouting engine isn't well designed, your event code is going to be a buggy mess
[23:09:30] <pulse> the main problem is it's all recursive and you have overlaps
[23:09:39] <pulse> so if you click a hidden thing, how do you tell it's hidden?

[23:10:05] <pulse> it needs high level orchestration
[23:10:24] <alycidyne> pulse: because one depends on the other's information, I assume
[23:10:39] <pulse> i've implemented a layouting engine for my wip UI engine and i can tell you some parts were mind boggling
[23:10:56] <pulse> so i can understand why CSS is the way it is
[23:11:03] <pulse> but it's pretty bad all things considered
[23:11:54] <alycidyne> pulse: though I really don't see why one would need hidden things to be able to be clicked on
[23:12:28] <GeDaMo> There may be different layers with transparency
[23:12:43] <pulse> alycidyne, they wouldn't, but it's hard to design your layouting engine in a way where that's naturally expressed
[23:12:57] <GeDaMo> So something can be visible to the user but behind another layer
[23:12:59] <pulse> it's much easier to design it half-wittedly, and then have spaghetti event code that does what you want very explicitly
[23:13:01] <pulse> rather than implicitly
[23:13:08] <pulse> and good architecture design is all about implicit solutions
[23:14:10] <pulse> consider this (rather trivial) example: https://i.imgur.com/unck8OD.png
[23:14:16] <alycidyne> Well, if hidden things can't be clicked on, then only the top-level element (in the particular Z-ordering) generates an event
[23:14:26] <pulse> the click occurs on container2, how do you prevent container1's button getting triggered
[23:14:48] <alycidyne> pulse: well, container2 is on top in that Z-ordering...
[23:15:22] <pulse> so you just take the top level container and bubble down to its children?

[23:16:30] <pulse> well button is container inside container1

[23:29:03] <Izem> s/configure/prefix/
[23:29:24] <pulse> alycidyne, basically it's not easy to do generalized layouts, much less UI
[23:29:43] <pulse> it sounds easy in theory but in practice all sorts of worms surface
[23:30:08] <Izem> or did this just come from makefile conventions?
[23:30:40] <alycidyne> Well, before one can even talk about GUIs, one must talk about layout
[23:30:52] <pulse> with actual UI you have to worry about events, scaling, resizing, fonts are a nightmare of their own, etc. - and the layouting engine has to be intelligently designed such that it allows for all higher level problems to be solved easily
[23:31:01] <pulse> and this is exactly why CSS is so bad
[23:31:21] <pyzozord> this is bad ass https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zprSxCMlECA&t=136s
[23:31:26] <pyzozord> "look ma, no computer"
[23:31:52] <pulse> because the layouting engine was originally a document model for printing text. then it got hacked so it could have buttons and input boxes. then it got hacked so it could support dynamic things. then it got hacked to support interactive content of every single type. then it got hacked to support various styling options, etc.
[23:32:09] <pulse> and now we have a tower of hacks and we call that web development

[23:33:50] <alycidyne> pulse: okay, but CSS aside, we had the Xerox Alto UI, TeX and X windows. No one of them use the same geometric system. So this isn't unique to CSS or in CSS's case.

[23:36:40] <pulse> i'm very much against generalizing UI in games
[23:36:47] <alycidyne> Yeah. Basically, my gripe is that we have streams as an abstraction of single-dimensional files, so why don't we have the same unification for two-dimensional plots/screens?
