[07:16:39] <lady_looptux> I feel ashamed. I had this great idea to do with docker, then all the sudden I forgot it...
[07:17:24] <rawtaz> lol
[07:17:42] <rawtaz> thats what you get for becoming senile :P
[07:18:32] <lady_looptux> I feel like it was something to do with monitoring/user management, but still, it's gone...
[07:19:11] <lady_looptux> rawtaz, I am actually 21, I'm not that old xD
[07:19:25] <rawtaz> its never too late to become senile :-)
[07:19:32] <lady_looptux> (Started using Linux when I was 13)
[07:19:47] <rawtaz> but i hear you. we've all been in a state of denial at some point, before we give in :<
[07:21:18] <lady_looptux> Funny thing is, I am self-teaching myself to use docker, but so far I am at the part where I can make/run containers ;-;
[07:21:44] <lady_looptux> But that's about it.
[07:21:46] <rawtaz> isnt that progress? why the sad face
[07:21:55] <rawtaz> FYI there is a #docker channel
[07:22:10] <lady_looptux> There is much more to learn. and OK i'll join it :D
[07:22:22] <rawtaz> there always is, it never ends
[07:22:32] <rawtaz> stuff to learn has been exploding since the 90s
[07:23:22] <lady_looptux> There is still some miscellaneous commands on Linux that I have yet to learn I swear xD
[07:23:34] <rawtaz> you dont have to know it all ya know
[07:23:49] <rawtaz> theres still stuff i dont know, lots of it, and ive been using Linux since -97 i think
[07:24:01] <rawtaz> who cares if i know the most intricate command. its not relevant, at all.
[07:24:28] <rawtaz> better focus your energy and time on learning things that are 99% more relevant and that makes you progress much much more
[07:24:40] <lady_looptux> Ah ok.
[07:25:04] <rawtaz> so what linux distro have you used?
[07:25:41] <lady_looptux> So many, OpenMandriva, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Arch, NixOS, Ubuntu, Debian, and more, waay more.
[07:26:12] <lady_looptux> The only distro that made me actually rage was NixOS
[07:26:26] <lady_looptux> (Unstable specifically)
[07:26:36] <lady_looptux> branch*
[07:27:16] <rawtaz> oh man, thats sad to hear. i was just about to ask how you liked NixOS, because i like it :D
[07:27:22] <rawtaz> im not using it though but i love the idea
[07:27:30] <lady_looptux> LOLNO, I no longer rage at it.
[07:27:36] <lady_looptux> That was at the start.
[07:28:13] <lady_looptux> I learned configuration dot nix rather quickly
