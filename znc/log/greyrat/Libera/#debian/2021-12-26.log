[03:15:29] <altker128> Hey guys, I just did an installation of Debian 11 "non-free-live-CD'" ISO I noticed it didn't ask me about desktop environment, SSH server, etc.  Is that just because it's the LiveCD or the non-free part?
[03:15:57] *** Quits: ooGoop9 (~realident@user/oogoop9) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:17:27] <jmcnaught> If you boot a live image the installer is calamares which is different from the normal debian-installer.  The debian-installer is still available as a boot option on live images.
[03:17:56] *** Joins: Zarla (~Zarla@89-156-36-219.rev.numericable.fr)
[03:18:08] <altker128> jmcnaught: I guess I chose graphical installer ; it looks like it installed the DesktopEnvironment associated with the livecd I used
[03:18:39] <altker128> jmcnaught: Does that imply using the non-graphical installer brings up the standard installation system?

[03:20:03] <jmcnaught> altker128: it's not a matter of graphical versus non-graphical.  If you boot into a live environment it provides the calamares installer (which is graphical).  debian-installer can be used in text mode or graphical.  netinst images use debian-installer.
[03:20:29] <altker128> jmcnaught: OK.  So I didn't boot into the LiveCD environment, I just selected 'graphical installer'
[03:22:05] <jmcnaught> altker128: did you configure networking during installation, and APT sources?
[03:22:42] *** Joins: ddsys (~ddsys@user/ddsys)
[03:23:36] <altker128> jmcnaught: Yes, I went through all of that .  It finished partitioning and everything but when rebooted it started into MATE (that is the LiveCD ISO I downloaded).  I just tried with the text-mode installer and stopped it after networking to see what steps it lists and it doesn't look like it asks about the DesktopEnviornment or any of that
[03:23:47] <altker128> It's not a huge deal, I'll try with the non-live-cd image but I do think this is trange

[08:50:43] <somiaj> I would first try firmware. I believe intel gpu firmware is in firmware-misc-nonfree
[08:51:05] <somiaj> but then just that package and linux-image-amd64 from backports will get you the backported kernel and firmware
[08:51:23] <hiya> somiaj: Ok thanks. Should I upgrade everything from backports?
[08:51:32] <hiya> or is it not recommended?
[08:51:52] <somiaj> It isn't recommended, the packages in backports are not tested to always work together, only with working against stable
[08:52:01] <somiaj> so only bring in from backports things you need.
[08:52:09] <hiya> ok thansk
[08:52:24] <hiya> linux-image-amd64 and firmware-misc-nonfree ?
[08:52:25] <hiya> only
[08:53:24] <somiaj> that will pull in the neesarry kernel package
[08:53:53] <hiya> firmware-misc-nonfree isn't in backports yet

[08:56:55] <somiaj> Arrowmaster: are you already running xorg? If so logout, and use your display manager to choose lxqt
[08:57:09] <hiya> somiaj: not only, just that laptop is heating up too much vs other distro, so I think it is kernel
[08:57:14] <hiya> I will upgrade the kernel and check
[08:57:27] <somiaj> hiya: What year was the laptop made?

[09:04:09] <hiya> somiaj: can you check 1 last thing? Is Mesa etc available in backports?
[09:04:34] <somiaj> Not yet, though I've seen some releases they ahve backported it. But you can always 'apt policy packagename' to see if there is a backports version
