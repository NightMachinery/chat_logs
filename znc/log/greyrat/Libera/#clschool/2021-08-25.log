[21:03:27] <ln43> Hi all, is there a way to use save-lisp-and-die from whitin the sbcl repl ? 
[21:03:44] <ln43> just to create an image in a smalltalks style ...
[21:05:50] <ln43> ok the easy solutio should be create symbolic links (using Portacle) to have sbcl running inside a command window but i was looking for other possible strategies
[21:06:09] *** Joins: ec_ (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec)
[21:06:34] <ln43> basically i was thinking to link inside the base folder directory
[21:07:08] <ln43> just to have those executables available at any time, but not being the supported option i was wondering if that was the right/preferable way to proceed 
[21:09:03] <ln43> yes i was asking if there was a possibility using sbcl from within emacs with slime and swank
[21:10:57] <lisp123_> Yes of course
[21:11:22] <lisp123_> Can you clarify your question further
[21:11:36] <lisp123_> Portacle uses Slime & Swank
[21:14:36] <ln43> yes of course... i was trying to use (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "nlp-image" :purify t) but i had a multiple threads error: Evaluation aborted on #<SB-IMPL::SAVE-WITH-MULTIPLE-THREADS-ERROR {1007285F93}>
[21:15:14] <ln43> the was just to save time loading the required packages to have a "clean" environment for further "development"
[21:15:37] <ln43> and using emacs to do that should be possible... at least from logic
[21:15:46] <ln43> so that error looks a bit strange
[21:16:40] <ln43> ... any idea about how to solve ?
[21:20:02] <ln43> maybe what i get is similar to this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48282586/saving-sbcl-image-from-emacs-multiple-threads-error
[21:20:31] <ln43> but why load the .asd file, then quickload the same system ... ?
[21:20:46] <ln43> mmh
[21:24:24] <lisp123_> Dunno, not something I am looking at that much
[21:24:30] <lisp123_> Hopefully somebody else can help
[21:24:31] <ln43> : /
[21:25:01] <lisp123_> (although I'm not sure if this stuff is that important tbf - as throwaway as that sounds)
[21:26:07] <ln43> ok, but i was trying to use an image for the first time and i get that error
[21:26:19] <ln43> maybe it's not importan but psycologically it is
[21:26:24] <ln43> *important
[21:26:57] <lisp123_> Yes, I don't want to tell you waht's important or not (I had that experience of asking stuff on other places before and the response, was just don't do that - which really doesn't help)
[21:27:50] <ln43> anyway now i'm reading from here https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/scripting.html
[21:28:36] <ln43> and i don't think in my case i should create and .asd file since quickload is working fine 
[21:29:02] <lisp123_> Yeah, .asd I think adds more complexity at times
[21:29:34] <lisp123_> Wasted a day learning it, but I think I need to move onto it at this stage in my particular program's lifecycle (after a year of working direclty in REPL)
[21:32:37] <ln43> eh yes... but working in the repl is fine once one is operatinf from whithin a specific package i suppose
[21:33:04] *** Quits: ec_ (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[21:33:27] <ln43> but ... ok, the same is using a .lisp file and load and compile
[21:33:34] <ln43> and then switch to the repl
[21:33:49] <ln43> it depends on how one is testing the code
[21:33:52] <ln43> mostly
[21:36:24] <ln43> i was thinking that for example using test frameworks to check the quality of the code edited in source files should be sufficient... or not?
