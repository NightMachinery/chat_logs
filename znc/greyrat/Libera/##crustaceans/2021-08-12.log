[00:04:42] <ngoldbaum> yay i can get fiber internet at my new house
[00:05:06] <ngoldbaum> presumably centurylink will have better peering agreements than my current shitty fiber ISP
[00:06:31] <bkero> They might
[00:06:36] <bkero> or they might just both go into your local IX
[00:08:27] <ngoldbaum> i’m currently using ting and i get 200 megabits down to netflix
[00:08:42] <ngoldbaum> when i last checked it was 100 megabits so i guess they’re improving things
[00:08:51] <ngoldbaum> still better than comcast
[00:09:09] <ngoldbaum> but definitely not actually anywhere close to the gigabit i’m paying for
[00:09:31] <ngoldbaum> the only time i’ve seen anywhere close to that was using the speed test directly to ting’s data center
[00:10:29] <indigo> How much are you paying ngoldbaum
[00:11:02] <ngoldbaum> $89/mo
[00:11:10] <ngoldbaum> centurylink will be $65/mo
[00:11:31] <indigo> Nice! I pay $79/mo for 200 down
[00:11:46] <indigo> No fiber here in my part of LA sadly
[00:19:45] <prussian> same as ^
[00:19:48] <prussian> but not LA

[00:48:20] <buttsbot> The Hobbit Duology | Hobbit Fanedits Wiki | Fandom
[00:48:21] <manicennui> Hmm.
[00:48:40] <manicennui> "This is a fanedit version of the original trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, the length was reduced from nine to five hours divided into two parts of approximately two and a half hours each. The integrity of the script and references to the original work were preserved."
[00:53:03] <Brekkjern> I've seen a fanedit and it kinda sucked. There are just so many problems with the adaption that bleeds into pacing of the original story
[00:54:14] <manicennui> It was apparently nominated for a Hugo.
[00:54:16] <manicennui> Which seems odd.
[00:54:54] <bkero> The edit?
[00:55:04] <manicennui> That's what I'm trying to figure out.
[00:55:19] <manicennui> The thing that was nominated is called The Hobbit Duology, but is described as a documentary.
[00:55:21] <manicennui> So probably not.
[00:55:33] <manicennui> I think it is this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTRUQ-RKfUs

[01:03:18] <gerikson> The Hobbit, as a book, is a kid's/YA work
[01:03:27] <gerikson> maybe not grand literature
[01:03:38] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[01:03:50] <Brekkjern> But the movie is eyecancer
[01:04:04] <gerikson> aye
[01:04:29] <ngoldbaum> ayecancer
[01:04:52] <gerikson> lol
[01:05:12] <ngoldbaum> lindsay ellis’ video essay about the hobbit is fun
[01:05:31] <ngoldbaum> she does video 1/2, 2/2, and 3/2 :p
[01:17:26] <gwozniak> I saw the first Hobbit movie and that was it for me
[01:21:24] <manicennui> It's hard to understand how those movies were made by the same person who made the LOTR films.
[01:21:49] <manicennui> Unless the studios just meddles a lot.
[01:21:59] <manicennui> You'd think they would leave him alone after the success of LOTR.
[01:22:11] <gwozniak> Dragging it out to 3 movies was just... not necessary
[01:22:48] <manicennui> Obviously having three films is the main reason why LOTR was successful.
[01:23:02] <drakonis> manicennui: studio meddling
[01:23:12] <drakonis> they do a lot.
[01:23:22] <drakonis> tolkien estate meddling too
[01:23:30] <gerikson> heh
[01:23:32] <manicennui> Sure, but wildly successful directors tend to have more leeway.
[01:23:35] <gerikson> worst people
[01:24:35] <drakonis> there was quite a lot of meddling with the movies

[01:26:32] <drakonis> bwoop
[01:26:33] <gerikson> I mean it can mean both git gud and good game
[01:26:44] <gerikson> so that's not the worst
[01:26:53] <drakonis> nah its always good game
[01:26:57] <drakonis> its never git gud
[01:27:07] <gerikson> TIL
[01:27:24] <gerikson> huh, the HN title team mutiated the name

[01:27:44] <gerikson> actually kinda impressed at the meme compression there
[01:27:58] <drakonis> i'm impressed they actually got seeded lol

[01:28:39] <drakonis> ohno

[01:28:51] <drakonis> ok so
[01:28:54] <drakonis> its by rioters lol
[01:28:57] <drakonis> riot games people
[01:28:58] <manicennui> Now people use it ironically, or they type it slightly differently to avoid the replacement.
[01:29:46] <drakonis> lmfao
[01:30:03] <drakonis> lmao though, league of legends, valorant and tft
[01:30:07] <drakonis> a little on the nose arent we
[01:30:14] <drakonis> its all games by the same company
[01:30:19] <gerikson> first comment - ``I look forward to seeing how you differentiate yourselves from Blitz.gg in a crowded market place given you are starting with the same supported games.''
[01:30:30] <gerikson> aka the HN way of typing gg ez
[01:30:36] <drakonis> lmao
[01:31:02] <gerikson> you sir, are a master. I salute you
[01:33:16] <Brekkjern> IMO, companies should stop trying to "enforce" manners on people, and rather just give them a score that otehr players can vote on. Only allow one vote from each player (so you can't just upvote your friends every game) and if the score becomes excessively low, punish
[01:33:53] <manicennui> Brekkjern: OW has such a thing, but you can only vote people up, and nothing happens if no one votes for you.
[01:33:55] <Brekkjern> It won't be perfect, but it would at least be rather simple and fix quite a few asshats
[01:34:11] <Brekkjern> manicennui: Yeah, but that's just commendations. Nothing for "you are an ass. GTFO"
[01:34:28] <manicennui> I don't think there is actually a solution in multiplayer games with anonymous strangers who can interact with each other.
[01:34:37] <Brekkjern> There is no solution
[01:34:46] <Brekkjern> It's a social thing. Can't solve that with tech
[01:35:01] <manicennui> A large percentage of people just turn into assholes when they are anonymous and unhappy.
[01:35:31] <Brekkjern> Yep. And if one could "categorize" them with such a voting system and keep them from ruining other peoples games, then mission accomplished
[01:35:41] <Brekkjern> Don't actually have to fix their attitudes or anything
[01:35:51] <manicennui> In most OW games at least one person on the losing team becomes toxic.
[01:36:20] <manicennui> And there are a lot of nerds who think they are being helpful by pointing out everything they think everyone is doing wrong.
[01:36:22] <Brekkjern> My point is that if someone is consistently toxic in some capacity, they would eventually have an excessively negative score and get punished for it
[01:36:28] <manicennui> I've resorted to just not joining text/voice chat.
[01:36:47] <gerikson> manicennui: so true re: nerds
[01:37:45] <manicennui> Until a few weeks ago I always joined chat. Maybe one out of every 100 games has a fun group of people who are just joking around and having fun.
[01:38:10] <manicennui> One of the most laughable aspects is how many people take the whole "competitive" mode super serial.
[01:38:19] <manicennui> Like we are "competing" for nothing.
[01:38:28] <manicennui> And I'm always in the middling ranks.
[01:38:35] <manicennui> So no one I'm playing with is going pro.
[01:38:54] <manicennui> It's literally just a way to see how you are doing. Nothing to take seriously.
[01:44:36] <drakonis> okay so
[01:44:45] <drakonis> i should tell you about the games i've played
[01:44:58] <manicennui> okay
[01:45:13] <drakonis> because any way to expose player stats to the public is tantamount to giving someone else the means to justify being an asshole
[01:45:26] <drakonis> see heroes of newerth, it had full public stats and people would bully you for it
[01:45:35] <manicennui> Yeah, the medal system in OW games is the source of a lot of toxicity.
[01:45:52] <manicennui> Although you can't see what other people earned.
[01:45:53] <drakonis> dota 2 has people getting mad about unranked games
[01:46:06] <drakonis> even though it doesnt mean shit and is effectively inconsequential
[01:46:17] <drakonis> league of legends does as well
[01:46:19] <manicennui> It is pretty common for people to get mad because they have gold something or another and they think someone else should have it, so obviously that person deserves harassment.
[01:46:50] <drakonis> competitive games open a window into being absolute assholes to other people
[01:47:00] <manicennui> The most common is tanks, who have way more survivability, and will often have golds because their team just dies and they survive longer.
[01:47:19] <manicennui> But they take this to mean that others are not doing their job.
[01:47:28] <manicennui> When it is just as likely that they aren't actually tanking.
[01:47:33] <manicennui> And just playing as a DPS with a lot of health.
[01:47:43] <drakonis> https://freenode.net/news/on-power-to-the-people
[01:47:43] <buttsbot> On Power to the People - freenode
[01:47:44] <drakonis> jfc
[01:47:49] <manicennui> drakonis: That's the thing I don't get: there is no real competition.
[01:47:53] <manicennui> You are competing for nothing.
[01:48:06] <drakonis> these games are inconsequential
[01:48:07] <manicennui> It's just a different game mode.
[01:48:09] <drakonis> none of it matters
[01:48:30] <drakonis> i've played several rounds of dota over the past week and i deeply regret doing it
[01:48:36] <drakonis> because it does nothing good to my sanity or time
[01:48:50] <manicennui> Yeah, I don't know why I still play.
[01:48:52] <drakonis> i end burning up time that i could use for anything else
[01:48:58] <manicennui> I'm not convinced that I actually enjoy it.
[01:49:00] <drakonis> hell, even other games are nicer
[01:49:07] <manicennui> By my brain likes the dopamine hits when something cool happens.
[01:49:17] <manicennui> s/By/But/
[01:49:20] <drakonis> i'd rather not play any game that's online driven anymore because of that
[01:49:31] <drakonis> i have a problem where i have to see a game through all the way
[01:49:38] <drakonis> a matter of honor if you will
[01:49:45] <drakonis> because people fucking suck and give up too fast
[01:50:18] <manicennui> Yeah, many people in OW will "throw" if things don't go their way.
[01:50:28] <manicennui> Or it is likely that they are going to lose.
[01:50:58] <manicennui> They will often try to justify it by claiming that someone else is doing something that is causing the team to lose.
[01:51:10] <manicennui> So obvious the mature thing to do is to also play poorly on purpose.
[01:51:12] <manicennui> Or sit in spawn.
[01:51:16] <manicennui> obviously
[01:51:41] <drakonis> yes
[01:51:45] <drakonis> that's something i don't understand
[01:51:52] <drakonis> sometimes people play poorly because they're just bad?
[01:51:55] <manicennui> I've also noticed that groups will circle the wagons around their members, even when one of their members is obviously the problem.
[01:52:00] <manicennui> I've even seen it in groups I'm in.
[01:52:07] <manicennui> If you aren't in the group, you are going to get blamed.
[01:52:26] <drakonis> are people not allowed to be bad before becoming good?
[01:52:33] <manicennui> drakonis: Not only that, but I'm playing middling ranks in OW. We are objectively not great at the game.
[01:52:44] <drakonis> also overwatch isn't a good game
[01:53:00] <manicennui> I agree, but I'm addicted.
[01:53:09] <manicennui> And haven't been able to become addicted to something else.
[01:53:16] <drakonis> oh i can find you something else
[01:53:24] <manicennui> It's not a matter of finding something.
[01:53:31] <manicennui> I just don't actually enjoy most games.
[01:53:56] <manicennui> But I can just sit down and play a few matches of OW before bed.
[01:54:31] <manicennui> Before OW I played nothing but TF2.
[01:54:36] <manicennui> I actually enjoyed TF2 more.
[01:54:43] <manicennui> But now it feels weird to play.
[01:55:33] <manicennui> I kind of want to play Death Trash.
[01:56:43] <drakonis> death trash is pretty decent, play the demo first though
[01:57:29] <manicennui> Excessive vomiting and befriending a giant flesh monster is my jam.
[01:58:07] <drakonis> yes indeed
[01:58:45] <manicennui> I'm not sure that I actually enjoy video games, but they are a change of pace from sitting around watching TV.
[01:59:27] <drakonis> to be fair, there are some games that are incredibly enjoyable
[01:59:30] <manicennui> The new What If? series on Disney+ has me really considering a subscription.
[01:59:39] <drakonis> sometimes i want to sit down and play something like metal gear rising
[01:59:46] <drakonis> solely because it is cathartic to slice things up
[02:00:18] <drakonis> sometimes, i want to play some doom mods because it is incredibly fun
[02:01:03] <manicennui> Long ago I remember playing some instagib Homer mod for Q2.
[02:01:22] <manicennui> I think Q2 is one of the last games I really enjoyed playing.
[02:01:24] <manicennui> Other than TF2.
[02:03:37] <manicennui> Oh, SteamWorld Heist was pretty enjoyable.
[02:04:19] <drakonis> there's plenty of fun games these days
[02:04:22] <drakonis> don't need to look very far
[02:04:51] <manicennui> Yeah, but I can't get into a lot of games that most people seem to love.
[02:05:20] <manicennui> I played about an hour or so of Fallout 4 and Syrim and that's it.
[02:05:28] <manicennui> Skyrim
[02:05:35] <drakonis> what kind of games would you like to play though?
[02:05:54] <manicennui> Like I said, I'm not sure that I do want to play at all.
[02:05:56] <drakonis> the first hour of skyrim and fallout 4 arent exactly a lot of fun though, they're pretty much protracted tutorials
[02:06:06] <manicennui> I think I'm just wasting time and procrastinating on other things.
[02:06:39] <manicennui> Played a couple hours of Deep Rock Galactic.
[02:07:10] <manicennui> The weird thing is I love watching videos on YT where people analyze video games.
[02:07:27] <manicennui> Not like analyzing professional play.
[02:07:38] <manicennui> But just reviewing or whatever.
[02:07:44] <manicennui> And the people who do crazy stuff in games.
[02:08:00] <manicennui> Can't think of that one guy's name who always finds bugs in simulation type games.
[02:08:06] <drakonis> spiffin brit or something?
[02:08:14] <manicennui> Something else.
[02:08:18] <drakonis> he showed up on my recommendations for a while

[02:09:55] <manicennui> Just the title of his videos make me laugh.
[02:10:00] <manicennui> He has one on Factorio.
[02:10:28] <drakonis> there's satisfactory, as well.
[02:10:31] <manicennui> Sorry, it is Satisfactory.

[02:15:08] <gerikson> yeah that's the Spiffing Brit
[02:15:10] <gerikson> he's ok

[09:22:52] <dimadima> get out of town
[09:23:07] <quanticle> It's *really* expensive
[09:23:14] <dimadima> that's so expensive
[09:23:16] <quanticle> Like, the thing I object to is the hourly pricing
[09:23:31] <dimadima> yeah i'm not going to start and stop my vscode
[09:24:02] * quanticle did some back of the envelope calculations and assuming like 8-ish hours of coding per day, that's like 70-ish days before you hit $2000
[09:24:26] <quanticle> You could buy like 4 top of the line Macbook Pros per year
[09:24:28] <quanticle> And still be better off
[09:24:51] <dimadima> yeah pretty nuts
[09:25:31] <dimadima> i guess they run on azure, but they can't sell for less than azure costs
[09:26:20] <quanticle> I don't object to it on a moral level; like... if you want to burn money or whatever, that's fine. I can also see a use for it in classes. Like, there's real value in being able to conjure up 50 or 60 identical standardized lab environments for students.
[09:26:22] <dimadima> organizations are going to buy this i guess
[09:26:30] <quanticle> But for personal use? Hahahaha no
[09:26:34] <dimadima> yeah
[09:27:40] <dimadima> i wonder how you can run local services with that thing
[09:28:33] <dimadima> i run the components of my stack that i edit in tmux locally
[09:28:47] <dimadima> seems like you'd have to do some port forwarding with this
[09:29:34] <dimadima> i suspect they have that figured out
[09:29:57] <dimadima> anyway the cost is insane for an individual, shame. i'm often wishing my machine was beefier
[09:30:33] <bkero> You also don't need a dozen GB of RAM and multiple cores to run non-electron code editors.
[09:31:18] <quanticle> I dunno I use emacs
[09:31:34] <quanticle> And I have a *lot* of elisp
[09:31:56] <quanticle> :D
[09:31:58] <dimadima> :)
[09:32:17] <bkero> You can also just not enter those modes
[09:32:25] <bkero> or have multiple emacs
[09:33:20] <dimadima> fwiw i don't think the weight of vscode is the electron but all the tooling you pull in that constantly runs
[09:34:08] <dimadima> if you run a whole stack locally eventually it gets kind of heavy. that's my epxerience anyway
[09:35:15] <quanticle> Speaking of emacs, though, does anyone else use spacemacs? I'm noticing a weird bug with Markdown mode's font-locking and I don't know how to debug it.
[09:35:43] <quanticle> If you have a long list of links, Markdown mode will just... refuse to fontify some of them randomly
[09:37:03] <quanticle> https://i.imgur.com/wVsA85o.png <-- Like, some of the links are just... default font
[09:37:21] <quanticle> Whereas others are markdown-url-face
[09:59:06] <manicennui> I don't, but I'm pretty sure there is an emacs channel.
[10:00:48] <quanticle> Yeah, good point, I'll ask there.
[10:03:59] <manicennui> I finally watched Lego Batman tonight. It is really good.

[10:42:00] <manicennui> https://randabreadbakers.com/our-menu
[10:42:09] <manicennui> Look pretty good.
[10:42:13] <manicennui> They have other locations.
[10:42:43] <manicennui> Or something.
[10:43:20] <bkero> Mmm sourdough
[10:43:23] <bkero> Mmm bagels
[10:44:00] <manicennui> I like the idea of bite-sized sourdough balls to.
[10:44:02] <manicennui> too
[10:44:20] <manicennui> Can't tell whether they actually have another location or are doing some kind of delivery.
[10:46:36] <manicennui> Anyways, they will be a few blocks from me.
[10:48:06] <manicennui> A bagel with cream cheese and a cup of coffee is my favorite breakfast.
[10:50:14] <manicennui> I recently found another cooking channel that I really like on YT: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzH5n3Ih5kgQoiDAQt2FwLw

[10:50:18] <manicennui> He does a lot of stuff with sourdough
[10:51:20] <manicennui> I really like the way he does meal prep.
[10:51:41] <manicennui> He doesn't make dishes. He basically prepares ingredients that can be thrown together quickly.
[10:52:08] <quanticle> Mmmm bagels
[10:52:49] <quanticle> You know how you're in *real* Minnesota? When you can ask for a bag-el and people understand you want a bagel
[10:54:59] <manicennui> In one video he throws some sourdough in a frying pan, adds some steak, cooks it, then throws some pickled vegetables on top and one of his prepared sauces.
[10:55:27] <manicennui> He basically always has sourdough starter, pickled vegetables, and various sauces.

[10:55:52] <quanticle> Goddammit, _Economist_
[10:56:05] <quanticle> Your study methodology is trash; Hacker News is not a representative sample!
[10:56:20] <quanticle> You're generalizing from an extremely biased selection!
[10:56:21] <manicennui> heh
[10:56:36] <manicennui> I think the scales are tipping though.
[10:56:56] <manicennui> My employer has always spouted the "we work better together" bullshit and is now giving in because people are leaving for remote jobs.
[10:57:06] <quanticle> I think they are too, but look at that graph. I don't think that the winds have shifted that much
[10:57:20] <manicennui> Even when we do go back to the office it will be 3 days per week.
[10:57:21] <quanticle> My employers has been "considering" how to get people back into the office approximately forever
[10:57:26] <manicennui> And they are allowing some people to be fully remote.
[10:57:55] * quanticle does go into the office about 3 days a week even though there's no formal rule requiring it
[10:58:03] <manicennui> 77% might be high, but there are definitely a ton of jobs that are open to remote now.
[10:58:06] <bkero> Office optional is best office policy.
[10:58:08] <quanticle> Our conference rooms have some really good mics and cameras
[10:58:17] <bkero> Sometimes it's nice to be in Thailand for 3 months. Hard to go in 1 day a week from Thailand.
[10:58:30] <quanticle> So when I need to do a meeting, especially meetings with people down at our other office in Florida, I'm going to go in
[10:59:10] <manicennui> I think I need to finally put the effort in and learn Clojure well and find a new job.
[11:00:19] <manicennui> My boss joking told me "please don't leave" the other day.
[11:00:58] <manicennui> I told her I wasn't looking, but the truth is I'm not seriously looking, but I do take a look once in a while, and I would not tell my employer that I'm probably going to leave before I do it.
[11:01:47] <quanticle> I'm actually not looking
[11:02:03] <manicennui> We get our bonuses around the beginning of March each year, and that is when a lot of people leave.
[11:02:13] <manicennui> And 25% of my current RSUs will vest.
[11:02:15] <quanticle> Current job is all right. It's decently challenging, the work is decently interesting, the pay is decently good, and I've been at it less than a year
[11:02:28] <quanticle> So it'd look really weird if I left
[11:02:36] <manicennui> I've been at this company for 6.5 years.
[11:02:53] <manicennui> Pay is okay and work/life balance is amazing.
[11:03:03] <manicennui> People are friendly.
[11:03:09] <manicennui> Just don't care for the work itself.
[11:03:25] <manicennui> Don't care about our industry either.
[11:04:33] <quanticle> What is the industry, broadly speaking?
[11:04:43] <manicennui> Online lending.
[11:04:46] <quanticle> Ah
[11:05:21] <quanticle> Yeah, that's one thing about this job: the work is actually good. I'm writing software tools to help people set up green energy installations
[11:05:26] <manicennui> There are a large number of companies in Chicago that were started by former employees of my employer.
[11:05:39] <manicennui> Including Avant, which is one that some people have heard of.
[11:05:45] <quanticle> Wind farms. Solar farms. We're *just* starting to integrate grid-scale battery storage
[11:06:28] <quanticle> It's weird (sadly) to work for an employer where you don't feel the need to make excuses for their existence
[11:06:37] <manicennui> Yeah.
[11:07:06] <manicennui> I'd settle for a better tech stack and an industry that I have slightly more interest in.

[13:52:03] <jeho> anyone good with big-O time complexity? I have a question about a nested loop that isn't exponential time, but I'm not sure what the actual complexity is.
[13:53:04] <quanticle> jeho: Maybe I can take a look?
[13:53:23] <jeho> cool.. okay, https://bpa.st/XWIQ
[13:53:23] <buttsbot> View paste XWIQ
[13:53:35] <jeho> sorry.. it's in python
[13:54:46] <jeho> each inner loop's range start is depenendent on its outer loop
[13:55:05] <jeho> it produces permutations instead of combinations.. if that makes any sense
[13:55:18] <quanticle> I do python professionally
[13:55:27] <jeho> awesome =)
[13:55:32] <quanticle> So don't worry about me not being able to read Python :)
[13:55:57] <jeho> i pasted a link to the code
[13:56:19] <quanticle> This looks like n^3
[13:56:27] <jeho> yes.. it looks like it
[13:57:10] <jeho> as an example, the loop count for N values isn't exponential
[13:57:44] <quanticle> So... I'm not sure I understand what the difficulty is here. This looks pretty straightforwardly O(n^3)?
[13:58:01] <jeho> it's not though
[13:58:16] <quanticle> Why not?
[13:58:37] <jeho> structurally it looks O(n^3).. but the number of actual loops isn't an exponential function of the number of nested loops
[13:58:58] <quanticle> Hold on, when you say "exponential" what do you mean?
[13:59:16] <quanticle> Exponential, as I understand it from my CS courses is O(2^n)
[13:59:20] <jeho> for instance, giving the function the value of 4, only 20 loops are performed... if this were really O(n^3), then 64 loops would have been done
[13:59:20] <quanticle> Or similar
[13:59:34] <quanticle> No, no, that's not how big-o works
[13:59:47] <quanticle> Big-o is a statement about *limits*
[13:59:48] <buttsbot> Your mamma's so fat, when she sat on a binary tree she flattened it in O(1) time!
[13:59:57] <jeho> heh
[14:00:09] <quanticle> Like, do you know calculus?
[14:00:23] <jeho> yes.. but the worst case limit of the function isn't O(n^3)
[14:00:39] <jeho> no value of n will be n^3 under worst case conditions
[14:01:07] <quanticle> No, but as n -> ∞, the value of the function will be less than n^3
[14:01:16] <quanticle> That's all that Big-O tells you
[14:01:43] <jeho> it will be considerably less than n^3.. in fact another formula would be more precise
[14:01:52] <quanticle> Yes
[14:02:05] <quanticle> You're looking for something like Big-Theta
[14:02:16] <jeho> so anyway, I did some digging and I found that the time-complexity for producing permutations is O(n!)
[14:02:21] <quanticle> Yes
[14:02:36] <river> you can produce a random permutation in O(n) using swaps though
[14:02:45] <jeho> code that produces permutations can be modeled after a nested loop like i hve it
[14:03:43] <river>  https://bpa.st/XWIQ this is O(n^3)
[14:03:43] <buttsbot> View paste XWIQ
[14:03:43] <jeho> each inner loop is one less than the outer.. so n * (n - 1) * (n - 2), etc
[14:04:03] <quanticle> I don't think your code for producing permutations is accurate, then
[14:04:30] <jeho> alright guys. thank you
[14:04:33] <river> big O isn't about precision
[14:04:42] <river> it's about throwing away everything except the dominant term
[14:04:42] <jeho> yes. I'm aware of that
[14:05:05] <jeho> I do understand big-O
[14:05:07] <river> the exact number of iterations is some polynomial like n^3 - 2 n^2 + n (or something)
[14:05:13] <quanticle> Yeah big-O just means, as n goes to inf, this function is less than this other function
[14:05:17] <river> but we just write O(n^3) for it
[14:05:44] <quanticle> I mean, you could just as easily say that code is O(n!)
[14:05:45] <jeho> yes, but I don't believe that is accurate.
[14:05:55] <quanticle> Because it is
[14:05:58] <jeho> tHank you guys for your input
[14:06:08] <jeho> I'll continue my search
[14:06:18] <quanticle> Uh... okay, have fun trying redefine math
[14:06:23] <river> it is O(n^3) and O(n^4) and O(n!)
[14:06:38] <river> O(n^3) is the best or most accurate description but they are all correct
[14:06:59] <river> big O is just an upper bound
[14:08:49] <quanticle> Yeah, the reason we call that code O(n^3) is because O(n^2) is too low
[14:09:04] <quanticle> And O(n^3) is the next simple function
[14:11:02] <edk> well any polynomial is eventually bounded above and below by the highest term anyway

[14:13:21] <quanticle> edk: Yeah, that's what I was trying to explain.
[14:13:36] <quanticle> Like, they were saying complexity(4) is 20 vs. 64
[14:13:46] <quanticle> But 4 is a small number
[14:13:56] <quanticle> What about complexity(40000000000)
[14:18:09] <quanticle> jeho: So the actual complexity of your code is n * (n -1) * (n -2) = n * (n^2 - 2n + 2) = n^3 -2n^2 + 2
[14:18:14] <quanticle> Which is O(n^3)
[14:18:41] <jeho> I've seen it expressed in other software forums as O(n!)
[14:19:06] <quanticle> That code? No, that code is O(n^3)
[14:19:17] <jeho> the worst case upper bound is definitely not in line with n^3
[14:19:17] <quanticle> Well, it's *also* O(n!)
[14:19:29] <quanticle> What do you mean?
[14:19:36] <quanticle> I'm talking about the code you pasted
[14:19:42] <quanticle> Which just calculates the sum
[14:21:07] <jeho> it's analogous to notating an O(n log n) algorithm as O(n^2).. where obviously the O(n log n) performs much better, so we make that distinction
[14:21:07] <buttsbot> Your mamma's so fat, when she sat on a binary tree she flattened it in O(1) time!
[14:25:30] <quanticle> Yeah, but actual code to generate all permutations is not O(n^3)
[14:25:45] <quanticle> The code that you posted doesn't generate permutations, it just calcuates a sum
[14:26:16] <jeho> eh.. the nested loop is still going to be intensive, and only fall off by maybe an order of magnitude or so for large values of n.. so i guess it might as well be O(n^3)
[14:26:47] <river> did you paste the wrong code by accident?
[14:27:17] <quanticle> Yeah, why don't you paste your actual permutation generating code
[14:28:43] <jeho> no.. it's top-secret =)
[14:29:27] <quanticle> Okay, well, then maybe this'll be helpful: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-complexity-permutations-string/

[14:30:43] <jeho> yeah.. that's a good link. thank you
[14:31:24] <quanticle> Yeah, like, pick a small number and then execute your code by hand, drawing out the function calls
[14:31:34] <quanticle> And you'll know exactly how many operations you have
[14:32:18] <jeho> sounds fun
[14:33:43] <quanticle> Heck, for real funsies, get the actual Python bytecode for your function
[14:33:51] <quanticle> And just iterate over that, counting ops
[14:36:51] <jeho> earlier I meant cubic - not "exponential" duh
[14:37:08] <quanticle> Oh... yes, that makes a lot more sense
[14:37:17] <quanticle> That function is cubic, yes
[15:13:16] <jeho> This thread agrees that the big-O for nested loops would be simply O(n^x) where x is the number of nested loops despite the inner loops having a different growth rate than the outer loops: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/279609/big-o-question-about-an-algorithm-with-n2-n-2-growth-rate

[15:49:44] * quanticle scanned the HN thread for it, and was surprised, but not really to see no mention of the fact that the layoffs were apparently pre-planned for when the company failed to get 40% (!!) year on year growth.
[15:50:47] <quanticle> 40% revenue growth rate year on year is insane for any company older than a couple of years.

[16:02:27] <prussian> hell, imagine if you could self-drive, I can see people doing 2-4 hour trips without thinking about it.
[16:02:37] <prussian> maybe even throw in a whole cross country tour.

[16:20:11] <wrl> but i'm sure we'll figure it out if we just keep pouring money into it
[16:20:30] <wrl> is "self-driving cars" just another gadgetbahn tbqh
[16:21:16] <Brekkjern> I do think self-driving cars will become a thing for the 99% case, but you will still end up with specialized needs that they can't provide fore
[16:21:39] <river> i really dont know, ive flipped flopped on it several times
[16:22:04] <Brekkjern> It will probably require us to change how we build infrastructure somewhat though
[16:23:49] <wrl> building infrastructure to accomodate self-driving cars: probably necessary so we'll do it
[16:23:55] <wrl> building infrastructure to accomodate bikes: under no circumstances
[16:24:00] <Brekkjern> Indeed
[16:24:18] <river> aaaaaa
[16:25:31] <wrl> there is no hindsight, only brute-force forward
[16:29:14] <mgdm> building tunnels to accomodate cars (but not to allow them to escape or even open the doors): sure
[16:29:14] <mgdm> building tunnels to accomodate trains: why would you do that?
[16:45:37] <prussian> more demand for cars from the voting populous.
[16:45:53] <prussian> kline: this. car season starts when?

[19:32:59] <indigo> What if they made self driving cars, but for many people at once? And then you could give them a route with “stops”
[19:34:23] <indigo> Please fund my idea YCombinator
[19:34:49] <river> i dont understand why self driving and electric has to come together
[19:36:54] <Geekingfrog> Isn't that because only Saint Musk can deliver on these (so both)?
[19:44:15] <prussian> so true
[19:44:37] <prussian> St. Musk, save us from the climate.
[19:45:27] <manicennui> His plan seems to be to find a new planet to fuck up.
[19:46:11] <prussian> genius plan honestly.
[19:46:36] <prussian> not sure where he can dump his externalities on though, that are near(ish)
[19:48:59] <river> shouldn't we make a moon base first
[19:49:19] <river> im no space colonization expert but that seems to make sense to me
[19:49:21] <prussian> well... ya. I'd figure that would be step 1
[19:50:24] <manicennui> First we should divert as much tax money as possible to private companies to recreate technology from the 60s so they can launch more satellites and block out the Sun.
[19:50:38] <river> lol
[19:51:07] <prussian> why must you hate on SLS?
[19:51:56] <prussian> weirdly enough, there was some strange air force contract to study what it would take to unmothball the F1
[19:52:03] <prussian> not sure why.
[19:52:51] <mgdm> I guess because it was proven tech
[19:53:26] <mgdm> (I hate on SLS a little because I think lobbing ex-Shuttle SSMEs into the ocean is a bit of a waste, but I guess it's kind of a viking funeral)
[19:53:32] <manicennui> It really doesn't even matter what they make. The key is giving them all our tax money.
[19:53:47] <manicennui> While they also complain about paying taxes.
[19:54:49] <manicennui> If we are going to destroy the planet, let's make sure that a handful of people have a good time on the way out.
[19:59:33] <prussian> A lot of people who were at Rocketdyne are either retiring or moving to SpaceX or Blue Origin anyhow.
[19:59:51] <prussian> RS-25 is still king though.
[20:00:15] <prussian> absolutely demented engine.

[21:34:52] <dmc> tfw people choose Discord over Matrix
[21:37:55] <cb> i've used matrix and it feels crumbly/janky
[21:37:56] <indigo> I mean, I chose Discord over Matrix
[21:38:08] <cb> said friend group went to TG
[21:38:12] <cb> that and the backend stuff i hear is fucked up
[21:38:43] <indigo> Discord is pretty nice; decent voice chat and good streaming
[21:39:20] <indigo> We play a game that does three person squads, so if there are more than three people online, the extras can watch someone stream the gameplay
[21:44:49] <mouseghost> idk i like telegram
[21:54:41] <kirch> I think we should bring back telegrams... I'll tell you more about it over Western Union
[21:54:57] <manicennui> I choose neither.
[21:55:40] <kirch> .-.. --- .-..
[21:57:06] <dmc> cb, when was the last time you tried it?
[21:57:29] <dmc> there are still rough edges, but they're being worked on
[21:57:48] <prussian> -- --- .-. ... .   .. -.   -- -.--   .. .-. -.-.
[21:58:37] <cb> dmc: a coupel of months ago
[21:58:55] <kirch> it's more likely than you think, prussian
[21:59:04] <prussian> clearly
[21:59:45] <dmc> I just Matrix for text communications so far
[22:00:33] <dmc> looking forward to it maturing a bit more so my non-techy friends don't run into issues
[22:00:38] <dmc> just use*
[22:00:50] <dmc> so I can setup a server for voice chat
[22:00:58] <dmc> and text too ofc
[22:01:27] <dmc> I forgot voice chat was a thing when I made my initial comment ;p
[22:01:47] <dmc> and the particular "people" this time were choosing Discord for text chat
[22:01:53] <kirch> I'm waiting for WeeChat's Relays to get parity with IRSSI Proxies.... because I'm not switching back to IRSSI
[22:05:40] <indigo> Lol at new Twitter font
[22:05:44] <indigo> Someone probably got promoted for it
[22:20:21] <companion_cube> kirch: what do irssi proxies do?
[22:20:54] <kirch> let you host an irssi instance somewhere and connect to it from other irssi instances
[22:30:41] <prussian> ya I had thought about using that.
[22:30:48] <prussian> but my znc still works
[22:30:49] <prussian> so meh
[22:38:27] <Xe> dmc: nerds pick protocols, normies pick platforms
[22:49:04] <prussian> fucking normies.
[22:49:47] <manicennui> Stupid normies trying to accomplish things instead of bickering about the details.
[22:49:51] <prussian> this
[22:49:59] <prussian> both ironically and unironically
[22:50:02] <mouseghost> normies just go with the flow though
[22:50:06] <cb> trying to achieve something? that's inethical
[22:51:57] <companion_cube> we're all normies in most dimensions
[22:52:05] <prussian> uh...
[22:52:06] <prussian> right
[22:52:07] <prussian> that.
[22:52:48] <mouseghost> what
[22:55:34] <manicennui> Lies! I'm totally unique!
[22:58:22] <Xe> manicennui: compared to me you are likely very vanilla
[22:58:55] <prussian> these are fair and valid points.
[23:05:22] <companion_cube> for example I'm a normie in the car and sports dimensions :p
[23:06:14] <manicennui> I don't own a car, which already makes me pretty weird in the US.
[23:06:34] <manicennui> I also don't follow sports.
[23:06:39] <manicennui> So unique!
[23:09:03] <companion_cube> right?
[23:09:13] <companion_cube> I technically don't own a car, it's my GF's :p
[23:09:51] <manicennui> Look at this normie with a gf.
[23:10:09] <companion_cube> white cishet AF
[23:10:24] <companion_cube> good thing I use a niche programming language, I'd be boring otherwise
[23:10:39] <manicennui> What happens if OCaml becomes popular?
[23:11:29] <prussian> I struggle to think what would be normal about me.
[23:11:40] <companion_cube> I'll have to use Gleam or Flix I guess
[23:11:41] <manicennui> Your bowel movements?
[23:11:49] <prussian> not even that is normal manicennui
[23:11:53] <companion_cube> your culinarity tastes?
[23:11:54] <prussian> the irony in that.
[23:11:58] <prussian> companion_cube: perhaps.
[23:11:59] <prussian> good one
[23:12:32] <prussian> speaking of bowels. I think I need to TALK TO MY DOCTOR ABOUT HUMIRA(tm) or would that be an (r)?
[23:12:38] <companion_cube> choice of clothing?
[23:12:42] <prussian> sure
[23:13:30] <manicennui> Your brace alignment.
