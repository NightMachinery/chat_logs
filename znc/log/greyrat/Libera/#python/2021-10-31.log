[02:44:39] <John_Ivan> nedbat, I see. so how/what should I do?
[02:44:57] <nedbat> John_Ivan: you are trying to get the a tags inside the dt tags?
[02:45:22] <John_Ivan> nedbat, yes, which in turn, have other tags. some with more complicated classes, others without.
[02:45:44] <John_Ivan> I'd have to deal with 3-4 classes
[02:46:35] <nedbat> John_Ivan: have you considered other parsers? lxml would let you use XPath expressions or css to find what you need
[02:47:00] <John_Ivan> my goal is HTML. it's that kind of problem.
[02:47:12] <nedbat> John_Ivan: lxml can parse HTML
[02:47:45] <John_Ivan> sigh. you know what. forget it.
[02:47:56] <John_Ivan> I'm just going to open up the py files and see what objects there's inside
[02:47:57] <nedbat> John_Ivan: but with soup, you (I think) can do:  for tag in tags: for a in tag.findall("a")

[02:49:19] <jinsun> you can do soup.dt.a too probably

[02:50:39] <John_Ivan> It does. But I believe the accusation wasn't targeted towards yourself. And if it did sound that way, sorry.

[02:52:17] <John_Ivan> people wanted to type less, so they got dynamically typed languages. great. I have to now struggle with even figuring out what my variables are

[10:49:27] <[-_-]> I do not have much experience with curses
[10:49:44] <The-Compiler> MrSunshine: I assume you'll need the same results as in JS?
[10:49:58] <KirkMcDonald> [-_-]: You probably want to call `parser.parse_args()` before initializing curses.
[10:50:21] <MrSunshine> The-Compiler, yup =) tried to get it to work but i get a number that is like 20 billion digits long .. while java produces something like 5 digits :P
[10:50:48] <The-Compiler> MrSunshine: yeah, ran into the same problem, looks like JS implicitly converts numbers to 32 bit if you use <<
[10:50:49] <[-_-]> yeah...but if something goes wrong, curses leaves terminal in a very ahhh....not useable state
[10:51:44] <KirkMcDonald> [-_-]: Doesn't curses.wrapper take care of that?

[10:56:09] <[-_-]> I am working on that
[10:56:14] <KirkMcDonald> MrSunshine: The `| 0` isn't going to do much in that Python code. It's used in JS as a sort of type annotation; you probably don't need to carry it over.
[10:56:31] <[-_-]> KirkMcDonald: I think I have an idea, I will call wrapper on some other function, see if that works
[10:56:44] <KirkMcDonald> [-_-]: Yes, that is what I am suggesting.

[18:01:03] <FurCoatStarlette> Probably a silly question - I am reading the basic tutorial logging module documentation. There is a section where they specify format='%(asctime)s %(message)s'
[18:01:40] <p-i-> I have a helper to pull out a row from a pd.dataframe: `row = lambda df, col_name, val: df.loc[df[col_name] == val]`
[18:01:46] <ChrisWarrick> jirido: I’m not a guard, just letting you know that you typically wouldn’t have much luck with non-Python questions
[18:02:02] <FurCoatStarlette> Where is the instantiation of basicConfig with the object "message" coming from? Message is not in the logging module.
[18:02:03] <p-i-> Problem is, sometimes multiple rows match the column-name. In this case I want only the first match.
[18:02:30] <ChrisWarrick> FurCoatStarlette: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes

[18:03:33] <p-i-> If I do `row_or_rows = df.loc[df[col_name] == val]` then `row_or_rows.shape[0]` will give the number of rows returned.
[18:04:11] <FurCoatStarlette> Chris it seems like these LogRecord attributes were originally designed for older versions of Python (before f-strings). Am I right in saying that?
[18:04:16] <catern> is there a one-liner to turn a list of integer keys with values into a list? i.e. {0: "foo", 1: "bar"} into ["foo", "bar"]
[18:04:22] <jirido> ChrisWarrick: Well I know,I know, but I guessed that guake used some python library and that The-Compier or his brother would have it behind the ear
[18:04:39] <ChrisWarrick> FurCoatStarlette: kinda
[18:04:46] <grym> catern: list(thatdict.values()) ?
[18:05:08] <catern> grym: well, i'd want it to also work for {1: "bar", 0: "foo"} :)
[18:05:11] <ChrisWarrick> FurCoatStarlette: I wouldn’t refer to f-strings, because you can’t really pass a f-string as an argument that will be formatted multiple times with different values
[18:05:29] <grym> catern: why wouldn't it
[18:05:31] <ChrisWarrick> FurCoatStarlette: but logging was invented before str.format and so it uses %-based formatting (which isn’t deprecated)
[18:05:44] <catern> grym: that would return ["bar", "foo"] instead
[18:05:51] <FurCoatStarlette> That's good to know, I will keep reading to familiarise myself. Thank you Chris.
[18:06:00] <The-Compiler> catern: what happens if a number is missing in the keys?

[18:07:12] <The-Compiler> no, wait, that's not how key= works
[18:07:27] <catern> incidentally, if I have the dict already like I implied, I guess just the obvious [d[i] for i in range(len(d))], but what I actually have is a list of key, value pairs, and it would be nice to have avoid making an intermediate dict explicitly...

[18:09:57] <The-Compiler> catern: anyways, measure instead of guessing if performance is important
[18:10:44] <catern> i mean the really performant approach is something like: l = [0]*len(data); for k, v in data: l[k] = v

[18:46:03] <the-mask> hello, is the circular import a bad thing in python ? I need to take a value in script1 / in script2 I make a calculation ; result of the calculation I want it back in script 1 ....is tis possible
[18:46:57] <ferros> This sounds like bad design, the-mask, wouldn't you want to run both script 1 and script 2 from script 0 instead or something of the sort?
[18:47:38] <ferros> Or simpler even run script 2 from script 1 and return back what you need
[18:47:46] <ferros> Sorry, it's Sunday my brain doesn't work
[18:49:30] <the-mask> ferros, hmmm - script1 has a tkinter interface ( from this I take some values ); script 2 takes those values and make some calculations; the rwsults I want to display back in script 1 - on the GUI interface ...; how I do that with 3 scripts ?
[18:50:45] <ferros> It's probably best someone else answers since I've zero clue about tkinter, I'd probably just import script2 run the relevant function and get the value back, but maybe I'm being daft

[23:00:53] <hook> I’m trying to figure out how to get colours in the python interactive shell. I swear I remember it being coloured some years ago, but when I run `python` it’s just all in default colour.
[23:01:17] <ChrisWarrick> hook: `python` doesn’t do colors
[23:01:24] <ChrisWarrick> hook: alternative shells, eg. `ipython`, do
[23:01:56] <hook> ChrisWarrick: Might have been IDLE, you’re right. It’s been a while.
[23:02:16] <ChrisWarrick> (idle ain’t worth using)
[23:02:22] <hook> ChrisWarrick: What’s a good alternative shell these days? IPython?
[23:02:27] <han-solo> https://bpython-interpreter.org/ # ?
[23:02:43] <ChrisWarrick> hook: I’d say so
[23:03:11] <hook> Oh, right BPython still exists, neat.
[23:03:33] <hook> I’ll take both for a spin and see what suits my (eternal beginner’s) needs :)
