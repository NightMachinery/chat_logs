A British shipyard (John Laird and Sons) built two warships for the Confederacy, including the CSS Alabama,[5] over vehement protests from the US.

[00:14:22] <e1f> interesting

[02:13:28] <sebboh> hi all.  Does a 7.6mb ascii file with no linefeeds make emacs hang in general?  toggle-truncate-lines was OFF, if that matters.
[02:14:37] <e1f> it shouldn't, if you have a modern computer
[02:15:00] <technomancy> sebboh: fundamental-mode or something else?
[02:15:20] <e1f> you can set debug-on-error to t before loading the file and when it hangs, hit c-g and the stact trace whold tell you where emacs is hanging
[02:15:27] <sebboh> I wrote a program and compiled and ran it.  It writes to stdout.  Due to a bug, it wrote about 7.6mb of ascii to standard out without linefeeds.  Emacs displays that output in a buffer named *compilation*.  Emacs hung..  And so did the program.  I killed the program's process from outside of emacs and emacs recovered.

[02:17:04] <e1f> it's always amusing how the problem changes from the initial description
[02:17:18] <sebboh> I modified the program to include linefeeds every 48 chars or so and the program + emacs ran normally and finished as expected.  I mean it took a second or two, no biggie.

[03:19:29] <sonny> I guess the real answer would be, they would implement elisp in golang but that's a waste since golang can't interact with widget libraries
[03:19:39] <bpalmer> a go executable can certainly load dynamic modules (using, e.g., the "plugin" library)
[03:19:55] <sonny> well, you could start using ipc ... but then it's starting to get really hectic
[03:20:33] <sonny> maybe it would be better, because you would be forced to make it really modular

[04:56:29] <deego`> johnjaye: it's the right syntax in some cases. In this case, it got parsed as a function call, since (fs-point) also happens to be a function. Therefore, when such ambuities happen, using the lisp syntax is the way to go.
[04:56:34] <Shortstop> how do I prevent word wrap in Emacs from happening to tables in Org Mode?

[08:02:43] <twb> I actually asked johnw why he wrote ledger in C++ when he knew better languages
[08:02:58] <twb> I don't remember what the answer was, but IIRC it was vaguely sensible
[08:03:01] <aidalgol> I was surprised to learn it wasn't written in Haskell.
[08:03:21] <aidalgol> I was also surprised to learn that Nix is written in C++ instead of Haskell.
[08:03:27] <sm> he didn't know haskell when he started, and did know c++ well

[09:12:50] <parsnip> is this a portable sink?
[09:12:56] <codingquark> parsnip: that sink drain thing is to "avoid splashes in car"

[09:14:31] <parsnip> i bought a small thermos coffee drink thing with plans to use it for coffee on bike rides, but i never really used it

[18:45:21] <grym> legacy pain is never going away, right
[18:47:07] <johnjaye> right. i guess the question is how do you manage it
[18:47:22] <johnjaye> perl just called perl6 raku i think?
[18:47:33] <grym> port or slowly lapse into unmaintainable pain
[18:48:03] <grym> like, ssl will stop working and then you're just hosed, for example
[18:49:09] <johnjaye> freebsd has a good system it seems to me
[18:49:25] <johnjaye> they have a dev branch but then small stable-ish branches between major releases

[18:49:49] <johnjaye> i guess debian is the same. but the idea is to make it clear this is development, this is stable. imagine being forced to debian sid then called a luddit if you refuse

[23:55:07] <bpalmer> grym: I believe so. (There are lots of nods to Jewish mythology throughout)
[23:56:01] <edrx> grtcdr: by "hiding the cursor" do you mean "hide the mouse pointer"?

[23:57:29] <bpalmer> grtcdr: if not, you could try setting cursor-type to be nil, and possibly set it back to t in an idle timer
[23:58:10] <bpalmer> (e.g., perhaps in an after-change-functions function, set it to be nil, so it disappears after you make a change in the buffer); then an idle timer brings it back every 60 idle seconds, until you make a change in the buffer again
