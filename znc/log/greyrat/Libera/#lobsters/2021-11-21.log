[05:52:27] <imode> does guix have the "everybody needs to write support for an application to be managed"

[06:02:31] <drakonis> yes
[06:02:33] <drakonis> also services
[06:03:09] <sam_> one of the most important things is documentation, and also ease of packaging / customising stuff yourself
[06:03:09] <drakonis> i also don't care for the nix language
[06:03:11] <drakonis> its bad
[06:03:17] <sam_> one of the problems i had with nixos (i am not sure if it applies to guix) is finding "tunables"
[06:03:18] <drakonis> its really hacky
[06:03:20] <drakonis> yes
[06:03:25] <drakonis> it does not apply to guix
[06:03:32] <sam_> !
[06:03:33] <drakonis> its really easy to modify a package
[06:03:56] <drakonis> invoke (inherit <package>) and it'll copy that to the definition and you can modify it freely
[06:04:09] <sam_> also, not to rant too much, but I honestly was a bit disappointed by nixos modifying gcc's default specs to enable using GCC 10 earlier before all nixpkgs were ready without seemingly realising the consequences
[06:04:18] <drakonis> there's also an upcoming feature for guix packages that allows you to define package options
[06:04:19] <sam_> they added -fcommon by default which is.. extremely confusing, and against the upstream behaviour
[06:04:35] <drakonis> ie: you can toggle a specific feature you want in the package and compile that
[06:04:39] <drakonis> its like useflags i suppose?

[06:13:08] <drakonis> if you want guix to manage the package, you need to write the definition, if you need it to be managed by shepherd and do declarative configs, you write a service
[06:13:16] <drakonis> and/or

[06:14:42] <drakonis> its a lot simpler than doing anything in nixos
[06:14:56] <drakonis> you can also write services using pure guile

[06:15:13] <drakonis> this is a really good explanation of how this works
[06:15:35] <drakonis> a thing that weirds me out about nixos is that it built itself around systemd's whole model
[06:15:56] <drakonis> its like a hermit crab
[06:16:24] <Church> I mean systemd honestly isn't a terrible model to build around
[06:16:33] <Church> As far as managing services
[06:16:42] <drakonis> a specific concept of services
[06:18:29] <drakonis> check the service composition page for the full explanation of what guix considers a service
[06:19:00] <Church> Oh I'm aware it has a lot
[06:19:31] <drakonis> its significantly more free form than anything else
[06:19:53] <drakonis> it does not judge
[06:21:34] <drakonis> if i want to write a service powered by mcron that restarts a service on specific days of the week with a different parameter each day
[06:21:40] <drakonis> it does not care, it'll do it
[06:21:47] <drakonis> its so good
[06:22:03] <drakonis> i use guile for that, no weird syntax
[06:23:13] <Church> Yeah fair that's kinda cool
[06:23:45] <drakonis> this is why the use of guile is so awesome
[06:25:23] <drakonis> also reusing code across service definitions
[06:27:15] <sam_> I like the idea of non-DSL.
[06:27:21] <sam_> Just reusing guile
[06:27:31] <sam_> please stop it, you are tempting me a tiny bit

[06:30:45] <drakonis> its one of those things that makes me say "i'm surprised this is even a gnu distro"
[06:31:42] <drakonis> adding new packages is so easy that i can sincerely say "fuck who cares, i can just add or modify packages"
[06:32:03] <drakonis> its so beautiful
[06:32:19] <drakonis> i see you on the channel :V
[06:33:09] <drakonis> heck, there's even a repo with the packages that do not meet standards, includes package quality and licensing
[06:33:26] <drakonis> refer to nonguix
[06:34:54] <drakonis> also the community is surprisingly sane.
[06:35:49] <drakonis> anyways, i'm going to get back to guilin'
[06:36:26] * sam_ has the manual open and is reading!
[06:38:16] <drakonis> nice
[06:38:21] <technomancy[m]> guix is one of those things I keep telling myself I want to try next time debian gives me trouble
[06:38:30] <technomancy[m]> problem is debian never gives me trouble

[06:38:50] <drakonis> i should point out that there's manual variant that has the whole thing in a single page
[06:38:52] <drakonis> well
[06:38:59] <drakonis> you can install just the package manager
[06:39:12] <drakonis> debian has it packaged as of bullseye i believe?
[06:39:21] <sam_> I think I'd prefer being able to try it in a directory or something given I love my Gentoo, and experiment with it for certain bits.
[06:39:25] <sam_> Is that a thing? I know it is for nix
[06:39:29] <drakonis> it is, yes.
[06:39:36] <drakonis> so, fun fact
[06:39:40] <drakonis> you can use shepherd as a user
[06:39:56] <drakonis> no need to install the whole distro for it
[06:40:34] <drakonis> it isnt something i've had the need for but if i remember correctly, it is there

[20:08:27] <rudi> also e.g. `choco install jdk11` if you use chocolatey
[20:08:51] <rudi> (I'm slightly out of the loop -- is https://chocolatey.org still the thing to use to install stuff on Windows?)
[20:08:51] <mockturtle> [ Chocolatey - The package manager for Windows ] - chocolatey.org
[20:09:17] <drakonis> its winget these days
[20:09:26] <drakonis> but that's only available for windows 10 onwards
[20:09:35] <rudi> thanks, will check it out
[20:10:02] <drakonis> chocolatey and winget have different approaches to solving the problem
[20:10:21] <drakonis> winget is the official one, so to say
[20:10:39] <drakonis> its package list is curated in a microsoft owned repository
[20:10:48] <drakonis> https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs

[20:11:16] <jicea> Scoop also is rather good https://scoop.sh
[20:11:16] <mockturtle> [ Scoop ] - scoop.sh
[20:11:34] <rudi> ah right -- I remember last time I checked winget out, some packages were missing that I needed so I went back to Chocolatey
[20:12:06] <drakonis> chocolatey is more like a product that positions itself as software install automation
[20:12:18] <drakonis> which well
[20:12:36] <drakonis> its presentation has shifted quite a bit since i've last checked it
[20:12:48] <drakonis> they're leaning really hard on selling it for enterprise
