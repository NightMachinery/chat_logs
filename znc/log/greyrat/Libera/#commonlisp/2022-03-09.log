[02:41:51] <brandflake11> Hello all, I am reading ANSI Common Lisp by Paul Graham and learning about tail-recursion and was wondering: is a tail-recursion function generally faster than using the LOOP macro, or a DO?
[02:42:58] <random-nick> execution speed depends on the implementations
[02:43:19] <brandflake11> I see, so there's no hard and fast rule when it comes to this stuff?
[02:44:08] <random-nick> well, I reckon that in most implementations it either compiles to the same code as LOOP or DO
[02:44:25] <random-nick> or it's slower since it uses regular function calls
[02:45:25] <brandflake11> random-nick: interesting...
[02:46:56] <brandflake11> If that is the case, is there a reason why tail-recursion is emphasized in Paul Graham's books? I guess I can write some functions and test them to really find out
[02:49:11] <random-nick> I haven't read that book but I presume it's either a stylistic preference or somehow more fitting for the book
[02:50:26] <brandflake11> random-nick: I see, thanks for the help
[02:51:57] <brandflake11> random-nick: I did do one test from the book, and it looks like the tail-recursion version of the function performed better than LOOP. The tail recursion version used 100 less cycles and took .000001 seconds less.
[02:52:05] <brandflake11> I will have to do more tests though
[02:52:11] <brandflake11> (And I'm still learning about optimization)
[02:55:44] <brandflake11> Interestingly, I did another test with a much bigger piece of data, and it turned out LOOP destroyed the tail-recursion version.
[02:58:48] <pillton> Tail call optimisation isn't required by common lisp implementations.
[02:58:49] <Alfr> brandflake11, optimizing tail calls is not mandated by the spec, so you might run out of stack space.
[02:59:18] <brandflake11> Alfr: Thank you for the heads up!
[03:01:35] <brandflake11> It looks like sbcl has it.
[03:02:03] <brandflake11> But that makes things interesting if I am making something for other common lisps

[03:17:19] <pillton> Well, if you use it, you need to ensure that the implementation supports it. The advised way of maintaining programs of that nature is to write some code which tests for the existence of tail-call-optimisation and pushes a feature on to *FEATURES*. The project source file which requires tail-call-optimisation should then contain #-my-project:tail-call-optimisation (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute) (error "This file
[03:17:19] <pillton> requires implementations which support tail call optimisation.")).

[17:47:49] <flip214> quite a price difference to 2019
[17:49:30] <Shinmera> that is why there is a kerfuffle.

[17:55:38] <Shinmera> Sure
[17:58:18] <beach> I'll say this again.  I think it's a bad idea to co-locate with <programming>  The previous times were both bad in some ways.
[17:58:42] <Shinmera> I agree.
[17:59:15] <Shinmera> Now more so than ever, but I'll refrain from saying more as Didier asked to keep this quiet for the time being.

[18:01:34] <jackdaniel> we could just buy 10l of gasoline today and sell it tomorrow, that would make the price difference in the ticket ;)

[18:08:05] <flip214> jackdaniel: well, just buy 5l today and bring it to ELS, you can pay there directly by handing over the bucket ;)
