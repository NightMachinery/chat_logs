[00:35:43] <seabass_> Hello everyone. Does anyone know of a good alternative to Microsoft Project? I've done some research into FOSS project management tools but haven't had much luck. OpenProject looks great for teams, but I'm hoping for something more single-user and desktop-focused. The apparent absence of any alternatives even had me looking for free trials of Microsoft Project, but it seems for that product, anything resembling a FOSS-friendly proposition is quite

[02:02:26] <qrpnxz> Hello. Is this a good place to ask about GPL and free software philosophy?
[02:02:40] <yrk> qrpnxz: yes

[02:05:32] *** Joins: Pickchea (~private@user/pickchea)
[02:05:43] <qrpnxz> So I like the GPL, but I'm having doubts about the AGPL. I was thinking how if I was using a computer terminal at the sandwich place, is it reasonable for me to demand the source of that terminal application? Furthermore, if I order a sandwich, can I then demand to see how they made the sandwich? Maybe I want to study and modify their sandwich recipe to make my own. This is essentially how I 
[02:05:44] <qrpnxz> feel about the AGPL at the moment. With the GPL it makes more sense because it's running on my computer, but outside of that I don't know.
[02:06:31] <yrk> qrpnxz: (applies to AGPL as well) http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#v3VotingMachine

[02:07:15] <qrpnxz> well, i know that the agpl in particular wouldn't require the sandwich place to do that, but what i'm getting at is that it's the same principle.

[02:29:19] <jxself> Check them out: https://www.rollapp.com/apps
[02:29:24] <qrpnxz> right, which I don't see how that applies to network use (not my computer, not my copy of the program), so I think i'll use GPL and not AGPL
[02:29:28] <jxself> They say that they can take any program with a GUI -- any at all -- and turn it into a "web app."
[02:29:36] <jxself> GIMP in your browser. 
[02:29:49] <qrpnxz> huh cool, i think makemkv has smth like that
[02:29:58] <qrpnxz> well, gtk has a web engine or smth
[02:30:09] <qrpnxz> or web backend
[02:30:25] <msiism> How is GIMP in a browser cool, though?
[02:30:47] <msiism> Seems more like definitely out of mind to me…
[02:31:10] <jxself> So this distinction isn't as clear cut as being presented of "not my computer, not my copy of the program" when they are in fact letting you run and use the program but denying any rights.
[02:31:16] <White_Flame> qrpnxz: it applies because you're still the user
[02:31:29] <jxself> Indeed, you're still the user of the program. :)
[02:32:36] <White_Flame> and the entire point of the GPL is so that software developers collectively contribute.  Pulling software behind a web-wall to dodge the GPL breaks the spirit of its law
[02:32:44] <qrpnxz> jxself: you don't run the program tho, it's happening else where. I just feed it data, and get results

[02:33:11] <jxself> Yes, the programs been taken away. We can imagine it might be a program that you would normally run on your computer.
[02:33:26] <qrpnxz> that's a reason not to use the service, but i can't reasonably ask for their recipe
[02:33:36] <jxself> So it's actually even worse that nonfree software. With nonfree software you usually get a binary and no source code. In this case you don't even get the binary.
[02:33:55] <White_Flame> qrpnxz: I don't know what part of this allegory you're focusing on, but a kiosk wouldn't hold the recipe
[02:34:14] <jxself> OK so once the whole world moves over to SaaSS and we have nothing more than dumb terminals we can sit there saying "yup this is good."

[02:43:12] <qrpnxz> I think AGPL can do good in encouraging use of software locally rather than on the network, but online services (that aren't sotfware substitutes) are needed sometimes.

[02:45:38] <White_Flame> you do not determine their license as a user.  You determine their license as a software developer
[02:47:10] <jxself> People should have the right to have private copies of programs that they don't share with anyone else; I don't think there's any question of that. It's even built in to the Free Software Defintion. The issue comes up when someone starts letting other people use it. They can't really claim it's still just their own private copy at that point. Saying so seems disingenuous.
[02:48:44] <White_Flame> and all the "behind closed doors" things that you shouldn't see are other people's data, not the code

[02:54:29] <qrpnxz> So if I go to the bank and I file a cheque, should the bank give me a document detailing me everything that will be done to that cheque? Should they tell be the technical details of all systems that form a single "work" that is processing the cheque? How does that make sense?
[02:54:33] <qrpnxz> If i get a program on my computer to do something with my personal bank data, i want the source code to that, but to ask the bank to give me that information of what they will do on their own computer just because my interaction trigger will trigger that program to execute-- why does me flipping a switch mean i get to know what the box attached to the switch contains?

[02:55:13] <jxself> The sandwich place analogy was probably a little off for this. Not that a sandwich place would use their own sandwich making machine in the back and give customers sandwiches; more that they let customers come in and use the sandwich-making machine themselves while *still* saying it's their own private stuff and people can't know how it works.

[02:57:12] <jxself> But https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html does give people the ability to have private copies.

[02:59:00] <jxself> I feel like I am repeating myself though.
[03:00:58] <jxself> It's often not that clean of a separation - even your bank likely sends software for you to run on your computer in order to access it in the form of JavaScript which do some of the work on your machine and some of the work on theirs where they effectively function as a single work.

[03:05:39] <jxself> Fortunately, we believe that you do have rights. Whether you do or not. :)
[03:05:40] <White_Flame> so again, the placement of that right into the whole usage ecosystem is not from the perspective of the user
[03:06:43] <qrpnxz> jxself: that's fine, but i don't understand why
[03:06:48] <jxself> Just like you also have the right to study the programs directly on your computer. Not everyone believes they have that right either.
[03:06:56] <jxself> But we do :)

[03:10:25] <White_Flame> qrpnxz: I'm not even arguing for the right to see these examples' code.  I'm just speaking about teh situations where others might
[03:10:33] <qrpnxz> i think at the very least, if i have some data in my computer, i should be able to mutate that data and copy it. This is really obvious. That a user asking their bank for their account balance should get access the source code of the entire software work that deals with their account balance on some other computer, that's gonna take a lot more explanation.
[03:11:02] <White_Flame> it's computing that they're subject to
[03:11:10] <White_Flame> with their data
[03:11:35] <qrpnxz> if i thought you could own data, i'd be in support for "intellectual property"
[03:12:20] <White_Flame> it's the user's decisions as to which code to trust their data with, and that decision cannot be made informedly without the code
[03:12:46] <White_Flame> (and again, I'm not even arguing for it myself, these are just dots that connect)
[03:13:52] <jxself> The AGPL blocks the saas loophole, where someone can take a free program and proprietarize it online. Then the parts of the GPL that say when you get software you get freedom don't get triggered because you're never actually getting a copy of the binary. Go back to RollApp for example. Or a proprietarized online GCC.
[03:14:04] <jxself> And the original plan was to have the Affero clause in GPLv3 too. So using the AGPL is more like using what the GPLv3 was originally intended to have been.
[03:14:21] <leah> interesting that stallman isn't on the lp2022 speakers list
[03:14:28] <djatropine>  really leah?
[03:14:34] <leah> if i'm not mistaken, it's the first time he's *not* been a speaker at libreplanet
[03:14:42] <White_Flame> and fundamentally, you're asking a question about literal belief.  as you're seemign to come here with a strongly held belief-based answer, you're going to have to try to understand things that you don't believe; (if any of that even reads sensibly enough)

[03:16:19] <jxself> Plans changed and the FSF compromised and made it a separate but compatible license. But look at who was doing the complaining. That should be informative.
[03:16:58] <Kolev> jxself, AGPLv3 was what the GPL was supposed to be.
[03:17:09] <jxself> Yes; that's what I said. :)
[03:17:37] <Kolev> leah says GPLv2 is better, that it fragmented the community, but the FSF did go to great lengths to compromise with industry by omitting things from GPLv3.
[03:17:42] <jxself> There's a whole rationale somewhere back for (I think Discussion Draft #3) explaining it.
[03:17:44] <leah> djatropine: rms doesn't seem like the type of person who would do drugs
[03:18:04] <leah> oldschool straight edge fellow by the look of it
[03:18:06] <jxself> Yes, and people say the FSF never compromises :)
[03:19:30] <leah> Kolev: i said gplv3 fragmented the community. my argument was that "the gpl" used to be the de-facto default free software license. people just used it, without even reading it, because they knew: everyone else was doing it. you could take code from almost anywhere and just use it. gplv3 complicated things and made it so people had to check, and it turned a lot of people away from gpl, and ultimately,
[03:19:32] <leah> copyleft
[03:19:59] <djatropine> leah: rms is straight edge?  I thought stallman would enjoyh rainbow gatherings  
[03:20:08] <leah> i further argued that if gplv3 hadn't come out, and gplv2 was still the latest version, that there likely wouldn't be such a strong shift to permissive licensing today
[03:20:20] <Kolev> IIRC, Stallman appreciates wine rarely.
[03:20:32] <leah> basically i argued that the fsf jinxed the whole thing, with the best of intentions
[03:20:52] <djatropine> wel i've had a spiritual experience with emacs & cannabis
[03:20:52] <leah> gplv3 didn't stop companies tivoizing anything, now they just do it illegally instead. or they rewrite stuff in gplv2 or some permissive license
[03:21:05] <leah> fragmented free software movement
[03:21:11] <qrpnxz> I consider GPL 3 a complete upgrade from 2
[03:21:15] <leah> in gplv2 days, it was more united
[03:21:24] <leah> it's like
[03:21:26] <leah> 80/20 rule
[03:21:28] <leah> worse is better
[03:21:45] <jxself> That specific problem only exists when people don't follow the FSF's own recommendations to use those 7 magic word "or, at your option, any later version"
[03:21:52] <leah> 80/20 rule is: if you try to get more than 80, you get 0
[03:22:04] <Kolev> djatropine, when you Emacs with cannabis, the parentheses look so amazing, so intricate and well-formed.
[03:22:14] <djatropine> Kolev: You are right!!
[03:22:16] <jxself> So, in a way, they create the problem themselves and have the power to also solve it.
[03:22:29] <leah> jxself: case in point: busybox. it's a mess of gplv2+, gplv2-only, gplv3+ and gplv3-only code. depending what configuration you use when building it, the result is illegal to distribute due to licensing conflicts
[03:22:47] <jxself> See above :)
[03:22:51] <leah> that problem wouldn't exist today if gplv3 never came out
[03:22:55] <djatropine> kolev; in fact one pof my web browser's of choice is eww 
[03:22:56] <leah> jxself: people don't follow instructions
[03:23:12] <jxself> But that's hardly anyone else's fault.
[03:23:17] <Kolev> OR is in the copypasta.
[03:23:20] <leah> it's a problem nobody needed to solve or be aware of before
[03:23:25] <qrpnxz> leah: that doesn't seem possible, gpl2-only is not compatible with the gpl3 parts
[03:23:27] <Kolev> ONLY is not in the copypasta.
[03:23:30] <jxself> And shouldn't mean that copyleft defenses should be upgraded.
[03:23:31] *** Joins: adduc (~adduc@24.15.97.76)
[03:23:43] <leah> also: gplv2 is simpler and probably more likely enforceable in court
[03:23:44] <jxself> Sure it was. GPLv1-only code was still a thing when GPLv2 came out.
[03:24:10] <leah> jxself: but the gplv1 came out in 1989 when free software hadn't reached critical mass yet
[03:24:10] <jxself> The numer of permutations increase as the number of GPL versions increase but the problem in and of itself is not new.
[03:24:25] <leah> so it was perfectly feasible to upgrade to v2 because the movement consisted of... 10 people
[03:24:27] <leah> :P
[03:24:34] <jxself> Hardly.
[03:24:46] <qrpnxz> gpl2 was latest for like 16 years
[03:24:47] <leah> 10 is hyperbole, you understand. but you see my point
[03:24:57] <jxself> But the answer can't be to never upgrade the GPL. There were clear problems with the GPL from its age that needed to be addressed.
[03:25:16] <leah> anyway, has anyone else but me noticed that RMS is *not* a speaker at lp2022?
[03:25:20] <jxself> But should follow the advice. If everyone did there would be no problem.
[03:25:47] <Kolev> GPLv2 does not become invalid with the OR.
[03:25:54] <qrpnxz> i find that the gpl 3 is nothing but an upgrade, really. I don't know if Linus read the final text, or he was just really salty
[03:26:10] *** Quits: xiews (~wxie@101.93.17.62) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:26:18] <leah> jxself: i want to be absolutely clear: gplv3 has very nice changes, which i think are great
[03:26:24] <jxself> qrpnxz: He did. He did not want to lose corporate contributors like Tivo who did not like the clause named after them.
[03:26:26] <leah> jxself: but people aren't like us
[03:26:32] <leah> the real world is messy
[03:26:49] <leah> people aren't going to follow your instruction. they do their own thing. and gplv2 was working
[03:26:59] <jxself> qrpnxz: So he was going after popularity not freedom which is not new for him.
[03:27:02] <Kolev> Even if GPLv3 were corrupt, GPLv2 would still be an option.  It would be like releasing Apache-licensed code and seeing it get reused in a project with a license you dislike.
[03:27:04] <leah> gplv3 mainly targeted: tivoization and patent trolls
[03:27:09] <leah> it failed to accomplish this goal
[03:27:19] <leah> you can often find companies now simply violating gpl(v3) instead
[03:27:23] <leah> tivoizing regardless
[03:27:27] <leah> and good luck finding/suing them all
[03:27:44] <leah> in other cases, they stuck with and forked gplv2 software, or rewrote it under some permissive license
[03:27:50] <Kolev> leah, Apple is scared of getting sued.
[03:27:52] <leah> they had/have the money to do that
[03:28:09] <leah> gplv3 caused more problems than it solved, in the world at large
[03:28:17] <leah> we used to have unity in the free software movement
[03:28:22] <leah> in 2005 if you said:
[03:28:22] <jxself> OK let's push out GPLv4 now!
[03:28:24] <qrpnxz> suing is always a problem, but also it's irrelevant, if it ends up being as strong as a permissive license, it's still worth using.
[03:28:28] <leah> "free software" "open source"
[03:28:32] <leah> people immediately thought:
[03:28:33] <leah> "the gpl"
[03:28:39] <White_Flame> I'll release GPL v0
[03:28:39] <leah> they didn't say gplv1 vs gplv2
[03:28:42] <leah> they said: gpl
[03:28:47] <leah> and had never read gplv2
[03:28:48] <qrpnxz> people still just say gpl
[03:28:49] <jxself> qrpnxz: The AGPL is the copyleft license for the internet. Think of it that way? :)
[03:28:49] <leah> but everyone used it
[03:28:52] <leah> so they used it
[03:28:55] <leah> it was the default
[03:29:04] <jxself> qrpnxz: On the internet, GPL is nothing more than a permissive license.
[03:29:26] <leah> i think we'd be in a stronger position today, with more free software and more freedom - and less permissively licensed projects on github - if gplv3 was never a thing
[03:29:29] <leah> i really believe that

[04:03:04] <isf> is based in ubuntu LTS
[04:03:15] <jxself> The whole point is being out of date - That is the selling piece. :)
[04:03:26] <isf> if you want the Debian replacement you must install PureOS tpefreedom

[04:03:51] <jxself> So at some point someone might talk of how it's "old" even though it was current at one point.
[04:03:59] <leah> linux abi is pretty solid and userspace doesn't change much. with newer libs installed for specific packages as needed, you can still use updated versions of packages
[04:04:07] <tpefreedom> pureos seems to have the same problem as the normal debian image.
[04:04:20] <tpefreedom> It doesn't play nicely with the atheros ar9271
[04:04:24] <qrpnxz> i tried trisquel on a vm because stallman says he uses it, but it was unusable. Really bad. Rather use Debian. Parabola may be good, but i like stable
[04:04:30] <leah> so trisquel being 2 years outdated isn't an issue. the main question there is hardware support, and jxself maintains an updated kernel repo
[04:04:30] <isf> what is atheros ar9261
[04:04:46] <AwesomeAdam54321>  The Guix System also has 32 bit support
[04:04:53] <isf> qrpnxz i recommend install hyperbola
[04:04:55] <tpefreedom> *9271
[04:04:57] <isf> guix isnt for normal users
[04:04:57] <tpefreedom> lol
[04:05:06] <tpefreedom> the chipset for the wifi dongle I use
[04:05:10] <jxself> I think Dragora too.
[04:05:13] <tpefreedom> my laptop has intel wifi
[04:05:22] <isf> you see if work with realy free drivers tpefreedom
[04:05:35] <isf> i recommend test it first before buy
[04:05:52] <tpefreedom> But the ath9k_htc driver is free software.
[04:06:08] <tpefreedom> so it should be included in the image imo
[04:06:15] <jxself> So is the Intel WiFi driver, haha :)
[04:06:27] <isf> i recommend you install Trisquel tpefreedom
[04:06:33] <tpefreedom> I did
[04:06:34] <isf> and update the kernel compiled by jxself
[04:06:38] <isf> the gnu kernel
[04:06:41] <tpefreedom> I'm using the kde version rn
[04:06:42] <isf> the last version stable
[04:06:43] <qrpnxz> isf: situation with hyperbola is really uncertain right now, they are going kind of crazy idk. Debian may not meet FSDG because it documents installing non-free software (which you may need to use your computer at all), but that's about it. Debian main is already free software. Therefore I don't have any qualms about using that and I don't feel the need to go to something that doesn't work as
[04:06:45] <qrpnxz>  well and doesn't have as much support 
[04:07:03] <tpefreedom> My problem with it being out of date is the other packages (games, libreoffice, etc)
[04:07:09] <isf> qrpnxz in eny case is trivial your problem, becouse free software is about freedom
[04:07:19] <isf> not about how the program work or how the code is
[04:07:31] <leah> ath9k_htc is actually an excellent choice vs regular ath9k. mpcie ath9k cards still have the same non-free firmware just baked in, whereas intel ones have it supplied by the kernel - that's why ath9k_htc is nicer, because it also has that firmware, but the firmware is free
[04:07:32] <qrpnxz> i don't have a problem is what I'm saying haha
[04:07:36] <jxself> But being "out of date" is also the same problem with Debian stable releases too so it's not specific to Trisquel. But any distro that freezes package versions on release.
[04:07:48] <isf> tpefreedom but trisquel 10 have new software
[04:07:50] <qrpnxz> debian is not out of date
[04:07:56] <leah> on ath9k_htc the firmware is supplied by your kernel
[04:08:01] <isf> you can install guix package manager in trisquel for install new software
[04:08:04] <isf> tpefreedom
[04:08:05] <leah> and is free
[04:08:06] <qrpnxz> and if you want new there's debian testing, which is basically never broken
[04:08:17] <qrpnxz> but ofc doesn't have as much testing as debian stable
[04:08:20] <tpefreedom> Debian 11 was on STK 1.2 or 1.3 but trisquel is on 1.1
[04:08:24] <isf> yes but debian isnt a free distro qrpnxz
[04:08:29] <qrpnxz> but it is
[04:08:31] <isf> not
[04:08:34] <isf> isnt
[04:08:35] <jxself> qrpnxz: But for apple-to-apple comparison, compare stable versions. Because that's what tpefreedom is talking of - the stable release of Trisquel.
[04:08:38] <qrpnxz> it just doesn't meat FSDG for the reason i pointed out
[04:08:41] <qrpnxz> debian main is free
[04:08:43] <leah> jxself: i'm curious, does anyone still sell those ath9k_htc usb dongles?
[04:08:44] <qrpnxz> fsf has said it is free
[04:08:45] <isf> here are the only ones free distros: https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html
[04:08:50] <jxself> leah: ThinkPenguin does.
[04:08:56] <qrpnxz> ok, ignore what i am saying to you fine
[04:08:59] <isf> all other distros arent free.
[04:08:59] <leah> i have a stash of them but i don't sell them. i just... have them lol

[04:11:22] <qrpnxz> isf: yes, debian main is 100% in that sense. the reason debian is not in that list is because it doesn't meet FSDG requirements of keeping users in the dark about how to use non-free software with no free replacement. I understand why FSF does this, if they want to showcase this distro fine by me. But you can't say debian is not free because it is

[04:18:47] <damo22> debian is not completely immoral
[04:19:03] <leah> not against. critically for. the mission is pure, but i've developed my own policies
[04:19:19] <leah> i believe fsdg is fundamentally flawed, when talking about firmware. for reasons shown in that post i linked
[04:19:22] <qrpnxz> leah: right. And you know Debian is does great by not even shipping the blobs in the OS. Fedora does ship the blobs just for firmware because yes. Let's get people on a 99.999% free system rather than having to use Windows because they can't do anything on trisquel
[04:19:45] <isf> ypu are promoting nonfree software leah
[04:19:45] <leah> fsf's mission is pure and gnu is great
[04:19:53] <isf> but you promote nonfree software
[04:20:11] <leah> so does fsf. it's just buried as "part of the hardware"
[04:20:13] <leah> software as circuitry
[04:20:33] <isf> that is your argument for recommend and promotion of nonfree software?
[04:20:42] <leah> there was a useful discussion about this on libreplanet-discuss recently
[04:20:44] <leah> let me find it
[04:20:51] <damo22> isf: why do you incessantly accuse people of pushing non-free software, people running any variant of GNU/Linux is already miles ahead of OSX and Windows users
[04:21:02] <damo22> stop creating divides

[04:22:04] <leah> ath9k_htc usb wifi dongles are the best, *because* the firmware isn't baked in but is uploaded by linux, *and* that firmware is free
[04:22:05] <qrpnxz> i think it's fine if FSF promote their FSDG distro above others, but it's clearly harmful because then you have people like isf that see that and push 100% free software Debian user away just because of some documentation detail.
[04:22:13] *** Joins: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice)
[04:22:20] <leah> if you take these three examples:
[04:22:35] <leah> * ath9k mpcie card: has firmware baked in, cannot update, but the firmware is non-free
[04:22:49] <leah> * intel wifi: no firmware, but it is uploaded by linux, to the card (firmware is non-free)
[04:23:00] <isf> i dont care the technical issues
[04:23:03] <leah> * ath9k_htc usb dongle: no firmware in it, is uploaded by linux, and the firmware is free
[04:23:04] <isf> that for me is completly trivial
[04:23:14] <leah> i believe the ath9k mpcie card is the inferior choice
[04:23:19] <isf> the only objetive of the gnu project and the fsf is the user freedoms
[04:23:26] <leah> you should choose the intel card or ath9k_htc dongle. and preferably the dongle
[04:23:42] <leah> they both give you more freedom than the ath9k mpcie card
[04:24:04] <leah> the intel one is better because the firmware can be RE'd and replaced
[04:24:17] <isf> better in what terms
[04:24:20] <damo22> i have an old atheros 5xxx
[04:24:25] <leah> on the ath9k mpcie card, that firmware is still there, just hidden in a mask rom inside the card. and not updateable. therefore less freedom available
[04:24:35] <leah> and with free wifi firmware you could do Software Defined Radio
[04:24:41] <leah> you'd have a lot of power
[04:25:12] <isf> and that is your reason for recommend install nonfree software?
[04:25:23] <leah> did you read what i wrote?
[04:25:30] <leah> you sound like a jehovas witness
[04:25:55] <isf> that is your argument?
[04:25:58] <leah> i'll make it clear: non-free firmware is bad
[04:26:09] <isf> and why you recommend install nonfree software?
[04:26:14] <leah> but at least the one where it's uploaded by linux, to the device, gives you more flexibility to RE and replace it
[04:26:44] <leah> if it's "software as circuit" embedded into mask rom inside the IC, i'd say that's less freedom respecting because the firmware is non-free and not updateable in any way
[04:26:47] <leah> how is that more free?
[04:27:13] <damo22> its more free because its part of the hardware so no one can replace it
[04:27:27] <damo22> if you dont like the hardware, buy a different one
[04:27:45] <isf> in terms of free software
[04:27:45] <damo22> i prefer that mode
[04:27:49] <leah> i don't buy it
[04:27:54] <leah> you have less choice
[04:28:03] <isf> you arent speaking about the free software

[04:28:18] <leah> i want to make it absolutely clear:
[04:28:39] <Kaiod> Well folks, let's go! The FSF maintains a list of approved and recommended distros. Including another one, which describes why it does not approve some distros (and has their reasoned criteria for this, with a very awesome team of experts).
[04:28:39] <Kaiod> There are other distros, such as Heads (libre privacy distro from Dyne.org) and Uruk, which are neither approved nor disapproved by the FSF. In that case, you can use some non-free distros as free, by modifying them and using free packages and components. 
[04:28:40] <Kaiod> I even have a reason to use Debian Nonfree, since I depend on the proprietary Realtek package for my wifi. I am a low income student, in a country with a different economy than the USA, so obviously I can't use something 100% free. But I can spread the idea and dialogue about this problem, even spread the philosophy of the movement, and this will not make me a supporter of proprietary software, I am fighting against it, we each have different fights
[04:28:40] <Kaiod> about it.
[04:28:40] <leah> in most cases, linux-libre supports yoru device because the firmware isn't handled by linux, but is in rom/flash on the device
[04:29:11] <leah> and to drive the point home: that firmware is still non-free. it's merely baked into the device, instead of being handled by linux
[04:29:20] <leah> the problem hasn't changed, it has just moved to a different location
[04:29:26] <damo22> if there is no platform for installing code on the device, its hardware, not software, and free software guidelines do not apply to hardware
[04:29:32] <leah> but it exists in the same capacity, with the same implications

[04:40:15] <leah> this is what we should be focusing on
[04:40:52] <leah> current doctrine from fsf is obsolete, in light of these developments
[04:40:57] <AwesomeAdam54321> tpefreedom: I don't think it matters, just as long as the OS on the chip is free software
[04:40:58] <Kaiod> Look, I don't know how it is in the USA, but if you went to a country like Brazil, you would see how this "use only free software all the time or YOU ARE FOR NONFREE" thing. You don't have all this freedom in your workplace, the minimum wage of many people is only enough for what you have, and there are not so many libre boards available except in the capital.
[04:40:59] <leah> we can go much further on the goal of user freedom

[04:43:21] <leah> emphasis on you
[04:43:47] <leah> current fsf doctrine is written with the assumption that this will happen in 30 years
[04:43:53] <leah> it's happening right now, as we speak
[04:44:20] <Kaiod> At what point did we stop being a community that was open to dialogue, that welcomed the user and taught him little by little about his own freedom? Where we didn't judge the person for using proprietary software, because they couldn't or weren't allowed to, and we taught them that freedom is conquered every day with any action in favor of it? 
[04:44:20] <Kaiod> I fight for education, for access for all, and I think that in order to grow as a movement we have to let go of some conservative points and focus on the collective path towards freedom.
[04:44:38] <leah> isf: but you can accuse me of promoting non-free stuff if you wish
[04:44:40] <leah> joke's on you
[04:44:59] <tpefreedom> well, you are the main dev behind libreboot
[04:45:38] <isf> i say you recommend nonfree software becouse you are against the gnu linux libre
[04:45:43] <AwesomeAdam54321> Kaiod: Agreed
[04:46:04] <isf> and you recommend install distributions with nonfree software like alpine BusyBox/Linux and OpenBSD
[04:46:33] <Kaiod> leah: Unfortunately some people focus more on saying this, rather than welcoming and dialoguing about philosophy for collective growth.

[04:47:53] <isf> kaiod the free software dont defend the collective as a first objetive of freedom
[04:48:11] <isf> the first objetive of free software is defend the user freedom as a individual freedom then the community of this individual user
[04:50:00] <Kaiod> A misunderstanding is circulating that the GNU Project demands you run 100% free software, all the time. Anything less (90%?), and we will tell you to get lost—they say. Nothing could be further from the truth.
[04:50:00] <Kaiod> Our ultimate goal is digital freedom for all, a world without nonfree software. Some of us, who have made campaigning for digital freedom our goal, reject all nonfree programs. However, as a practical matter, even a little step towards that goal is good. A walk of a thousand miles consists of lots of steps. Each time you don't install some nonfree program, or decide not to run it that day, that is a step towards your own freedom. Each time you decline
[04:50:00] <Kaiod> to run a nonfree program with others, you show them a wise example of long-term thinking. That is a step towards freedom for the world. -- Richard Stallman (https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/saying-no-even-once.en.html)

[04:53:09] <Kaiod> Also, thanks for clarifying!
[04:53:47] <jacobk> What's the 80/20 rule?
[04:54:19] <AwesomeAdam54321> jacobk: 20% percent of people get 80% of the work done I think
[04:54:35] <leah> jacobk: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle
[04:55:07] <isf> sound a anti-voluntary thing
[04:55:20] <leah> "80% of sales come from 20% of clients" translates to "80% of freedom comes from 20% of work"
[04:56:08] <leah> but in our case, lots of us are working on different things. so we can get to maybe 95% collectively
[04:56:27] <isf> the users dont need
[04:56:29] <jacobk> Oh I get it now
[04:56:31] <isf> work in a group
[04:56:40] <leah> fundamentalists do 80% of the work for 20% of the gains
[04:56:45] <leah> that's the joke
[04:57:40] <isf> so for you fundamtalist are who defend the users freedoms
[04:57:45] <isf> as Richard Stallman
[04:58:02] <isf> who defend the RYF certification
[04:58:10] <leah> RYF is garbage
[04:58:10] <jacobk> RYF isn't 100% though
[04:58:37] <isf> so you prefer buy hardware with backdoor in the software in level of firmware right?
[04:58:39] <isf> leah
[04:58:42] <leah> my reasoning for that statement are here: https://osboot.org/news/policy.html#problems-with-ryf-criteria
[04:58:49] <damo22> isf: your time would be better spent teaching people who have no clue that GNU exists
[04:59:02] <isf> you dont know my work is damo22
[04:59:03] <leah> and here: https://libreboot.org/news/policy.html#problems-with-ryf-criteria
[04:59:09] <leah> though both articles say the same thing
[04:59:17] <isf> if you know it you answer can be different
[04:59:56] <leah> ryf is the reason why nobody cares about EC firmware on laptops for example
[05:00:16] <leah> everyone says coreboot this, coreboot that. there's a giant blob though on a processor on i2c
[05:00:19] <leah> and that is:
[05:00:35] <leah> https://libreboot.org/faq.html#ec-embedded-controller-firmware
[05:00:49] <isf> we only care about software
[05:00:51] <leah> isf: and EC is updateable
[05:00:58] <leah> isf: take ryf-certified thinkpads for instance
[05:01:00] <isf> the only issue is the software
[05:01:08] <leah> isf: on those thinkpads, lenovo pushes updates to the user updating both bios and ec
[05:01:20] <damo22> yeah that is a problem, but i cant fix it
[05:01:21] <leah> so ec doesn't fall under "software as circuit" or "not intended for update" argument by fsf
[05:01:27] <leah> it's updateable, and intended for update
[05:01:36] <leah> fsf ignored it
[05:01:41] <leah> and i feel guilty
[05:01:49] <leah> because i profited from their lie for years
[05:01:58] <leah> i don't anymore. nowadays i'm setting the record straight
[05:02:25] <leah> isf: consider my article that i've linked with an open mind
[05:02:32] <leah> i want more freedoms for everyone
[05:02:57] <isf> i dont care about hardware
[05:03:00] <leah> fsf criteria is too conservative by modern standards. it holds us back because people look at it as a gold standard, and fsf says "everything is ok" and then nothing more is done
[05:03:08] <leah> that's the problem with it
[05:03:14] <damo22> isf: EC firmware is replaceable
[05:03:17] <leah> if complied with, the result is a relatively free device
[05:03:24] <leah> *relatively* free device, not fully
[05:03:33] <leah> but fsf says "fully" and then people are not incentivized to look further
[05:03:38] <isf> you can replace it with software? without hardware interaction? leah
[05:03:53] <leah> isf: btw, effort was made to replace the EC firmware on h8s ec
[05:04:01] <leah> h8s being the ec in said thinkpads

[05:04:40] <leah> i'm not sure why it was abandoned
[05:04:44] <leah> probably the author got bored
[05:04:51] <leah> the work remains incomplete
[05:05:13] <jacobk> I wonder, is OSHWA-certified hardware implicitly RFY-compliant? If so that might be a better future standard of freedom than RYF.
[05:05:34] <leah> ironically, no
[05:06:19] <isf> in terms of computing i only care about free software in terms of hardware i recommend install hardware who rescpect your user freedom in your software
[05:06:34] <leah> isf: let's be clear
[05:06:41] <leah> you are thinking of software running on the host CPU
[05:06:45] <leah> supplied by your OS
[05:06:50] <leah> or on the bios chip
[05:06:52] <leah> right?
[05:07:04] <isf> in terms of software only
[05:07:07] <leah> if not on host CPU but supplied by linux, you also want that to be free
[05:07:27] <leah> isf: there is a problem with this line of thought
[05:07:55] <damo22> what if there is a sideband processor that prevents freedom 0 by refusing to boot the main processor
[05:08:01] <leah> isf: the problem is: in case of coreboot for example, you need to know how the hardware actually works. that implies access to schematics, chip datasheets etc
[05:08:18] <isf> i dont use linux becouse linux install nonfree software
[05:08:22] <leah> isf: so you see, hardware freedom is critical
[05:09:05] <leah> isf: your thinking, inspired no doubt from rms's teachings, is based on an old assumption of software being its own isolated little thing. and that used to be true. we used to not have any chance of any real control over hardware, so this compromise was made in the early days
[05:09:19] <leah> this compromise is no longer necessary, and in fact it is foolish
[05:09:22] <leah> we can do more
[05:09:35] <leah> software does not exist in a perfect little bubble
[05:09:43] <AwesomeAdam54321> But since hardware is so complex, hardware has its own software and that too needs to be fre

[05:13:38] <leah> see, i'm thinking maybe we ditch "free software" and make a new term, encompassing both software and hardware
[05:13:47] <leah> i haven't coined a good terminology for it yet
[05:14:11] <leah> i want the new term to encompass the exact same ideological zeal as "free software", with the exactly same goal and priority
[05:14:12] <qrpnxz> it's all about free information. FSF has a software focus, but I have a problem with copyright in general.
[05:14:17] <leah> but with hardware being an equal citizen
[05:14:28] <leah> right now, we have "free software" and hardware is an afterthought
[05:14:33] <leah> afterall: language is how we think
[05:14:42] <leah> so if we want to expand our thinking, we need to expand our language
[05:14:49] <leah> right now we have: free software. oshw. etc
[05:14:57] <leah> i think having these separately is a problem
[05:15:11] <leah> i think we need to realign our thinking with a new terminology that combines both things
[05:15:14] <leah> hardware and software
[05:15:23] <damo22> rms specifically said in one of his speeches that the four freedoms dont apply to hardware "YET" in 2009
[05:15:24] <leah> but that's just me, and i could be wrong
[05:15:28] <Kaiod> leah: a new term that encompasses both? libre tech?
[05:15:37] <leah> damo22: they sure do now :)
[05:15:43] <leah> the four freedoms apply to hardware in 2022
[05:15:50] <isf> free software cant be in terms of hardware.
[05:15:50] <qrpnxz> i would go all out and say free information.
[05:15:59] <leah> sam zeloof smashed that old assumption to pieces
[05:16:03] <leah> hardware is less hard than we think
[05:16:05] <isf> Applying the same concept directly to hardware, free hardware means hardware that users are free to use and to copy and redistribute with or without changes. However, there are no copiers for hardware, aside from keys, DNA, and plastic objects' exterior shapes. Most hardware is made by fabrication from some sort of design. The design comes before the hardware.

[05:17:01] <leah> you all need to look at these
[05:17:33] <jacobk> I don't know, I feel like making CPUs is comparable to copying books before e-books. Sure you can do it, but it's impractical for most people, so the freedom to do so is not very important (yet).
[05:18:05] <jacobk> Though, I don't think one moment it's not important and the next moment it is. It's a gradual increase in importance.

[07:21:29] <isf> but im always a foreigner in the earth im not from here that is what i believe 
[07:21:38] <isf> in my intelectual freedom
[07:22:01] <epony> yeah, it's understandable why you don't like your state and country of residence and think it's coercion and pressure and domination over you
[07:22:19] <zaher> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem
[07:22:21] <isf> that is becouse i they force 
[07:22:34] <epony> america is not a land of freedom, despite what it says on the envelope
[07:22:34] <isf> against your wish
[07:22:40] <isf> i dont care where im
[07:22:48] <isf> becouse im a foreigner
[07:23:10] <epony> it's a land of opportunity, to take advantage of someone else
[07:23:34] <epony> that's what a license is most of the time, a limitation of what you can take advantage of
[07:23:41] <isf> depend
[07:23:43] <isf> of the license
[07:23:49] *** Quits: SH3LLC0D3R (~Thunderbi@2800:484:537b:5400::3) (Quit: SH3LLC0D3R)
[07:23:51] <isf> and depend what part of the license you accept
[07:23:58] <isf> and what part of the license you dont accept
[07:24:01] <epony> how many clawses does your license have?
[07:24:13] <isf> when i accept for example
[07:24:15] <isf> a software license
[07:24:20] <jxself> qrpnxz: Of course I meant to share it.
[07:24:33] <isf> is the anti-restrictions
[07:24:48] <isf> that mean license who let me do what normaly a copyright dont let me
[07:25:08] <isf> so, normaly i use licenses with copyright who work in a anti-copyright normaly called copyleft
[07:25:09] <epony> the licenses are using copyright law though
[07:25:17] <isf> yes sadly
[07:25:36] <epony> so they come with in-built pre-defined limitations already
[07:25:39] <isf> becouse is a "legal" way they use for work for the works who live forced for the state
[07:25:48] <epony> and it extends them further
[07:25:59] <epony> but less that others that you find unacceptable
[07:26:14] <epony> so you're accepting a lesser problem compared to a larger problem, but always a problem
[07:26:30] <isf> the problem isnt the license
[07:26:39] <isf> becouse the license dont have strength for himself
[07:26:44] <epony> then why is it always the theme of the debate?
[07:27:12] <isf> becouse normaly you dont have other things to speak
[07:27:15] <epony> these are very hard questions, don't worry, they are not against you personally.. you can't solve these
[07:27:28] <isf> i dont care about if yo uare against me or not
[07:27:31] <epony> but I am teaching you that you yourself don't have the answers yet, but you're answering to others
[07:27:34] <isf> you have intelectual freedom 
[07:27:38] <isf> i dont care if you dont like me
[07:28:10] <isf> the only what is important for me in terms of what you do
[07:28:10] <epony> but nobody needs to be told what they already know, like you don't need to tell a free person that they are free
[07:28:14] <isf> is in the crimes
[07:28:33] <epony> then why do you need in a license to tell a program that it is free, was it non free without the license telling it?
[07:28:44] *** Joins: SH3LLC0D3R (~Thunderbi@2800:484:537b:5400::3)
[07:28:52] <isf> that only depend of the autor

[07:29:10] <isf> if the autor is my friend, and him say to me "dude i create this, use it how you wish"
[07:29:24] <epony> so the law is exploiting programs as owned property
[07:29:31] <isf> the property is good
[07:29:39] <epony> what if your program is sentient and it has person like qualities or qualia
[07:29:43] <isf> becouse i have property of all my software

[07:31:18] <Andrew> That's ... aka circular
[07:31:28] <epony> so you're not the owner of the software, you're not the owner of the license, and the license instructs you what you can and can not do, and you think the license is liberating you and your program from its owned and proprietary position?
[07:31:29] <Andrew> I get your point but some people won't get it
[07:31:40] <Andrew> Define "own"

[07:32:52] <epony> did you agree with me before that point?
[07:32:56] <isf> you cant change the software i have
[07:33:01] <isf> becouse you dont have the property
[07:33:15] <isf> becouse im the owner of my free software
[07:33:34] <epony> Feb27 0324<epony> the point is, who has the control, not who your user(s) is or what they choose
[07:33:42] <isf> and all software i use is free as in freedom software
[07:34:10] <isf> you point of view sound as communist point of view of property
[07:34:18] <jacobk> I'm not sure you can "own" a copy of information, but I'm not sure that it matters.
[07:34:22] <epony> so you say you're the owner and you have control, thus taking the inalianable rights of the author
[07:34:44] <isf> im not speaking about who is the author or not

[07:35:16] <Andrew> Ugh, how do you have control for a copy?
[07:35:24] <isf> if the free software dont have owner the software is propietary aka nonfree
[07:35:28] <Andrew> Many nonfree software licenses don't allow for free private use
[07:35:39] <Andrew> What about public domain software?
[07:35:44] <isf> with the 4 essencials freedom Andrew
[07:35:54] <epony> what about software with no license
[07:36:09] <isf> if you have a binary without license
[07:36:11] <Andrew> epony: That's nonfree in most juristictions
[07:36:12] <DiffieHellman> epony: Proprietary, the Berne convention automatically makes it so.
[07:36:16] <isf> isnt free software becouse you dont have the source code
[07:36:19] <Andrew> Yes
[07:36:34] <Andrew> Well, even source-available non-licensed software is proprietary
[07:36:39] <epony> so that convention denies freedoms of software and puts it under copyright law of software
[07:37:04] <epony> but it was created about copyright of physical objects like books and their distribution
[07:37:10] <DiffieHellman> Public domain binary-only software can at least be reverse engineered legally, but such is not free software as the source is not available. 
[07:37:17] <isf> that depend always of who defend
[07:37:26] <epony> so it protects the rights of the resellers or distributing publishers and marketers of the books
[07:37:28] <isf> the license
[07:37:30] <isf> "defend"
[07:37:37] <epony> software however is not a tangible good
[07:37:57] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: Would you consider it to be free if the corresponding source has been reverse engineered and can produce exact (except for timestamps, syslib stuff) binaries?
[07:38:27] <epony> and it has nearly no cost clone and transfer between people, as you can share it as folklore
[07:38:49] <epony> do you have copyright on your cultural heritage and folklore that all people know and sing along happily?
[07:38:50] <isf> software is like a book
[07:38:59] <epony> only it is NOT a book
[07:39:14] <isf> for me is like a book
[07:39:15] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: Yes, such source could be free software, but the licensing is up to whoever wrote the source
[07:39:17] <epony> you can make a book of software and claim it is covered in the copyring law conventions
[07:39:23] <epony> but it isn't a book
[07:39:28] <isf> i dont care
[07:39:29] <isf> xd
[07:39:37] <epony> it's more like shared recipes between people and folklore between groups of people

[07:43:10] <isf> that depend of your believes Andrew
[07:43:23] <Andrew> Why is attacking humans a crime but attacking a turtle in your backyard is not?
[07:43:25] <isf> only exist 2 freedoms who are the only importants becouse all freedoms depend of them
[07:43:34] <Andrew> Both humans and turtles have senses, as far as we know
[07:43:39] <isf> Intelectual Freedom and Freedom of Life
[07:44:05] <Andrew> And who are we to say?
[07:44:10] <White_Flame> imprisonment meets those 2 freedoms
[07:44:12] <isf> that is the only two freedoms who all mans born with them without people who can give to them the freedoms
[07:44:14] <White_Flame> so I think you need a bit more
[07:44:15] <epony> imagine that your programs are living beings, do you tell them they are your property or not?
[07:44:27] <isf> me too White_Flame
[07:44:46] <isf> a freedom to life, and intelectual freedom the base of the mans
[07:45:02] <isf> epony stop living a fantasy xD make real example
[07:45:22] <epony> your thinking has been affected, by contact with the thought police already
[07:45:44] <epony> you believe a license is contract and violating it is a crime
[07:45:50] <Andrew> <Erica> Humans are social 
[07:46:05] <Andrew> wraps head around things
[07:46:16] <epony> and you think your government is against you so you definitely live in an authoritarian regime of dystopian type
[07:46:21] <isf> Human are individuals who have intelectual freedom and freedom of life
[07:46:33] <isf> the social issue born after
[07:46:57] <isf> but first, all mans born with individual intelectual freedom and individual freedom of life.
[07:47:04] <Andrew> 03and you think your government is against you00 give me an example of a good government
[07:47:17] <epony> but you think you should support a convention on property of tangible goods and their distribution for intangible culture like folklore and software between the common people
[07:48:05] <epony> and then you lie that a license is "liberation" as if it's a paper note saying that a program needs to be freed from shackles of ownage and proprietorship
[07:48:10] <isf> for me the only goverment good is who arent governed by mans who dont respect the freedom of life and intelectual freedom
[07:48:18] <Andrew> sorry you're letting my entropy increase
[07:48:18] <epony> but you claim you're the owner and sole proprietor of your copy then
[07:48:28] <isf> i know 1 who do it, but maybe you dont like him
[07:48:53] * epony thinks isf voids licenses but demands everyone else has them
[07:48:58] <Andrew> Free software licenses are a pragmatic against abuse into nonfree software, sure we'd like a world where everything is PD, but that's not happening yet
[07:49:19] <epony> what's stopping you?
[07:50:02] <Andrew> Fear that i.e. MS/Intel/Apple would bake my stuff into the next version of Windows/ME/macOS prooprietarily
[07:50:11] <epony> do you live in an oppressive occupation and foreign control which prohibits folklore and culture?
[07:50:27] <isf> the free software licenses are needed only becouse the state force the mans to have all his property with a restricted license by default
[07:50:32] <Andrew> epony: Explain?
[07:50:41] <epony> so turns out countries where such large companies are really non-free then
[07:50:44] <Andrew> isf: That's not a good answer i believe
[07:50:52] <isf> maybe not, but is true 
[07:50:57] <Andrew> epony: Everything is nonfree by default in most couuntreis
[07:51:03] <epony> are the real monopolies and authoritarian state machine
[07:51:06] <isf> like USA
[07:51:09] <Andrew> isf: The distinction between PD vs license in this case?
[07:51:10] <isf> for example, that say RMS
[07:51:39] <isf> i dont know Andrew normaly from my point of view the distintiction is a license of free software defend terms specifics
[07:51:51] <isf> and normaly have a defense of the user freedoms
[07:52:05] * epony thinks your international spanning global cartels of imperialist (monarcho-fascist) capitalism mega-corporations and world monopolists are your masters and your state, not your government
[07:52:10] <isf> public domain can be changed for restric the users
[07:52:20] <Andrew> epony: That's right
[07:52:22] <isf> if you change it and you change it for restric the users
[07:53:04] <epony> you live in coproland (corporate proprietary land) of closed opportunities
[07:53:13] <isf> normaly free software licenses like GPL have a way to defend the user freedoms with the copyleft 
[07:53:21] <Andrew> s/you/apparantly most people/
[07:53:25] <epony> which is a bit unfortunate, but at least your're still alive
[07:54:04] <epony> at what point does these cartels choose you're not on their list of "allowed" to exist persons / groups / programmes of control of the global population?

[07:55:03] <epony> yes, you're a libertarian isolated single individual anonymous coward ;-)

[08:00:45] <isf> or possible malware
[08:00:57] <isf> that is a big vulnerability if you ask me
[08:01:09] <epony> yes, but are small vulnerabilities acceptable?

[08:08:33] <epony> for example when you go to the doctor's office, you get examined and you get prescribed a recipe, do you recieve a license with that recipe?
[08:09:06] <isf> always when you participate with others you are under a "license"
[08:09:14] <isf> or under a "law"
[08:09:17] <isf> for example
[08:09:22] <isf> if you go to my house
[08:09:27] <epony> what if your doctor was an automatic consultation program evaluating your "symptomatic needs"?
[08:09:53] <isf> and in my house we are defender of free software
[08:10:00] <isf> you go to accept it
[08:10:10] <Andrew> Sorry, I think it'd be good if software is not copyrightable.  BUT IT IS.  Comparing it to goodly non-copyrightable stuff is meaningless.  Using software licenses, again, is a pragmatic against the greater evil (corps) that we see all the time.
[08:10:17] <isf> that mean you dont go to my house to speak against us, becouse i invite you to it that mean respect
[08:10:22] <epony> and that program was dispensing free recipes from the book of natural healing traditions of your people also known as folklore?

[08:11:18] <epony> a distributor of other people's software is again a company of distribution and has all attributes of those corporations
[08:12:06] <isf> and what?
[08:12:06] <Noisytoot> Andrew: epony and isf are arguing
[08:12:10] <isf> xD
[08:12:23] <epony> it collects money for that, it has staff, and payroll, and director board and chairmen, it has bank accounts and accountants and a legal arm office and even prosecutors on staff
[08:12:25] <Andrew> Noisytoot: ?
[08:12:33] <Andrew> Obviously?
[08:12:37] <isf> the trade system work like that if you hate someone but him have something you want
[08:12:42] <isf> you dont go to speak bad about him
[08:13:03] <isf> you go to speak with him respectful and you go to buy the thing him sell
[08:13:13] <isf> that is part of the intelectual freedom
[08:13:29] <epony> why would you feelings have anything to do with a software license then?
[08:14:36] <epony> so, how do you differentiate one software vendor from another saying that their produce is gratis if they have all other attributes the same, but in a smaller proportion
[08:14:51] <isf> learning
[08:14:54] <epony> at which point does the small free distributor become large enough to not be free any more?
[08:15:21] <isf> the capitalism, always is a way of exploring the trade system looking for a better price and better service
[08:15:33] <epony> does your license protect against violation of the delegated rights from author to distributor on the side of the distributor?
[08:15:35] *** Joins: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34)
[08:15:50] <isf> becouse i distribute free software, for example the installation of trisquel for 34 usd
[08:16:01] <isf> and other can do the same but for 15 usd, all have the freedom to do it
[08:16:16] <epony> you say you own your copy and you distribute it, are you the distributor now or the distributor where you obtained your license from?
[08:16:21] <isf> but if you choise me or you choise the others depend of your exploration
[08:16:44] <isf> i say them the author

[08:18:02] <epony> so you want the software copyright convention because you want to sell free software, which can be obtained from elsewhere for more free, do you become an enemy of the more free point of software distribution then?
[08:18:29] <Andrew> lol
[08:18:32] <isf> if you cant sell free software
[08:18:40] <isf> the software is propietary software
[08:18:46] <isf> and dont respect the users freedoms
[08:19:08] <Andrew> I'm against selling everything that isn't tangeble, except for the cost of distribution itself, just as a side note
[08:19:09] <epony> you one little "corporation" you know that ;-)
[08:19:39] * Andrew facepalms
[08:19:40] <epony> yet software is on the Internet for free download
[08:19:55] <isf> if they have internet and they want install it
[08:19:56] <DiffieHellman> Andrew: By doing that, you deny yourself the ability to make profit, but of course you're free to do that.
[08:19:59] <isf> they can do it
[08:20:11] <isf> they can do it if they want, but epony if they accept my service
[08:20:20] <isf> they have intelectual freedom to pay me if they want
[08:20:26] <isf> i never force them :)
[08:20:27] <epony> Andrew, that comment was for the other little corporation, you're a decent copy centre..
[08:20:31] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: That's right

[08:40:34] <DiffieHellman> Unix(R) is a trademark you gotta pay for.
[08:41:09] <isf> BSD is a kernel or a operating system?
[08:41:15] * Andrew reads abouot activitypub
[08:41:23] <DiffieHellman> There are a number of BSD OS's
[08:41:34] <AwesomeAdam54321> DiffieHellman: I thought UNIX was the trademark, and Unix was the proprietary operating system
[08:41:53] <epony> how are you going to requests someone to respect trade marks when they do not respect simply legal aspects of software?
[08:42:10] <isf> any way all bsd distros arent free

[08:42:35] <epony> isf, are you envious of the more free BSD licenses or the more open BSD software?
[08:42:44] <DiffieHellman> More free?
[08:42:54] <DiffieHellman> They are less free as they lead to less freedom.
[08:43:04] <epony> less limitations seems to mean more free
[08:43:13] <DiffieHellman> They are less restrictive, but of the things you want to restrict.
[08:43:39] <epony> does the US constitution lead to more freedoms in the countries the USA occupies and liberates of their natural resources?
[08:43:54] <epony> it says "liberty tax" on the box
[08:43:59] <DiffieHellman> Nothing to do with software freedom, but okay.
[08:44:10] <epony> by principle of generation
[08:44:22] <Andrew> 
[08:44:36] <epony> you say less restriction generates less freedom
[08:45:05] <epony> so more restriction should generate more freedom, and your "freedom" is financial or rather legal "merit"

[08:46:38] <epony> you see, there is a set of principles, like you can't possibly claim absolute freedoms coming from a system of non free existence allowed
[08:47:18] <epony> the copyright on sofware is this system that says no free existence allowed
[08:48:52] <epony> but then you build on that piedestal a great declaration of independence from software unfreedom with a couple of documents that impose limitations on the recipients of those leaflets that come next to some software that you distribute on behalf of others who might choose other if you do not "pressure them" to use your distributor services as licensing and others
[08:49:26] <epony> so you distribute limitations, but call yourselves the freedom protectorate
[08:49:47] <epony> and that only your freedoms propagate freedoms and the others are not free without your freedom
[08:49:57] <epony> sounds a bit like forced freedoms
[08:50:15] <epony> maybe it is indeed how the USA system operates on the world
[08:51:12] <epony> but it's been fun testing your competence level anyway ;-)
[08:52:37] <epony> just remember, the loudest copyright on software protectors, are the ones who want to make financial gains from that, exactly as with other copyrighted distributions

[21:51:21] <epony> do you see how much of the same this behaviour is, despite being totally different ethics and qualities
[21:51:42] <epony> that comes from the same "protective" and "expropriating the attention / market" tactic
[21:51:52] <epony> the ownage of things, is due to the licensing model
[21:52:13] <epony> more on the right, more captive and more all encompassing and more vending oriented
[21:53:13] <epony> now, that is easy to see by comparing the permissive and protective, which is closer to shareware, proprietary, commercial and trade secret licenses
[21:54:23] <epony> but you can't claim there is no other free software before you, and that you're the only and one true vendor of software freedoms, because you're not the only one, and not the first, only you try to be the last, but you're also superceded
[21:55:03] <furrymcgee> vendor of software freedoms?
[21:55:35] *** Quits: junebug (~junebug@2600:1700:3db0:2540:b54b:f8c3:ed3a:ac59) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[21:55:39] <epony> so, free software is a large work field, and there is place for many projects and workgroups, you just need standardisation and compatible software implementations
[21:55:52] <epony> that is really the important part
[21:56:26] <epony> standards and valid high quality software adhering to them, while at the same time retaining your preferred model of freedoms and openness, that's up to you to choose
[21:57:10] <epony> just be decent and don't claim you're the only true freedom vendor, cause it sure looks like imperialist capitalism of liberation from other softwares
[21:58:59] <epony> but address your efforts towards the government regulation, so it protects free software and makes sure monopolism and cartel aggreements can not attack free software like stealing the computation and standardisation from free software work and hobby groups
[21:59:31] <furrymcgee> how so?
[22:00:40] <epony> not against other free software projects, against corporate abuse of the economies of scale towards a global domination of badly abusive bundles of hardware+firmware+software+forced_services+application_vending+data_theft+surveillance
[22:01:09] *** Joins: b50d (~b50d@2a01:c23:7016:e500:ad0a:4417:b2c5:8098)
[22:01:32] <furrymcgee> yes there is and always will be a software vs hardware conflict
[22:02:40] <epony> see, that point I made earlier about "mobile" devices, portable and handheld computer-like appliances that are becoming non-standard compliant embedded computing preventing the use of alternative option of source free and control free firmware and software
[22:03:22] *** Joins: plitz (~user@191.190.32.76)
[22:04:45] <epony> the debate about free vs open is just a licensing matter that is small and in the past, when sponsorships of commerce for public software vendors was taking over from government funding (which coincided to collapse immediately after the commercialisation of hardware started picking up scale)

[22:06:02] <epony> so, the real betrayer of freedoms is your government which fails to ensure a regulatory model such that corporations and megamonopolies and international global cartels operating under its jurisdiction pay taxes and provide that to public software authoring groups with ethics, quality and integrity
[22:07:04] <epony> it just gets corrupt funding itself and is installed by these megafinancial pyramids, to prolong and ensure the unfair disparity and leaves to the public to save themselves pleading for charity towards the big money proprietary vendors

[22:08:41] <epony> how much more sad can this get.. well it gets a lot more sad, since these companies pick "favourites" and clash them against each other, fighting proxy wars on free software turf, while at the same time reaping the rewards of competition and aggressive campaigning for their "improved" and "extended" commercial note NON STANDARD and proprietary EVIL software for finance and profit GLOBALLY
[22:10:10] <epony> the only way to solve it, is by demanding that hardware is standards compliant and openly unbundled from firmware and software, a court case which the government won against IBM in 1968 creating the software market
[22:10:13] *** Quits: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[22:10:48] <epony> this monster creation is now the major revenue of income for the economy of software vending as part of proprietary and secretive hardware designs
[22:11:52] *** Joins: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34)
[22:13:10] <epony> it can be a fairly more accessible and open standards field for really best quality competition, instead of advantageously allowing for a patented commercialisation and rigged captive markets, until then a lot of international protectionist measures will have to be applied retroactively and fix that with outside intervention
[22:14:23] <epony> the risk is to bypass completely the resale of forced services which are disallowed and do not work across continents anyway
[22:15:12] <epony> but with that it might result in bypassing the US American economy of hardware+firmware+software vending completely
[22:15:25] <epony> it's just a captive reseller
[22:15:50] <epony> exactly as the "software copyright" and "patents control" captivity
[22:15:58] <furrymcgee> conclusion?
[22:17:06] <epony> address your government to collect tax from your corporations and delegate free software replacement for proprietary systems or risk fallout from competition by more open and standards compliant devices produced and sold directly by producers
[22:17:38] <epony> exert political pressure on your government to fix that with regulation of standardisation and compliance
[22:18:02] <epony> exclusive rights vendors are bad for the global economy
[22:20:32] <epony> but first you have to work on your beliefs of exculsivity and sole origin of values and ethics towards other projects and not allow corporations of monopoly cartels to control you and turn you against other free software projects
