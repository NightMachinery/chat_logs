[00:20:24] <Kaylah> hello, I don't understand why this statement is true: https://i.imgur.com/3OfWgoX.png
[00:21:00] <Kaylah> I would think it must be less than 1, but why would it be less than or equal to 0?
[00:21:45] <Kaylah> that would require the summation to be greater than or equal to f_i, but that's not what they're saying
[00:22:17] <rubiksdream> they just rearranged the inequality
[00:22:37] <Kaylah> but (3) is not an inequality, is it
[00:22:57] <rubiksdream> i think they meant the expression in (3) is geq 0
[00:22:58] <Kaylah> or does it have to do with the fact that (3) states that the sum must be part of Z, hmm
[00:23:30] <rubiksdream> oh wait, im misreading
[00:23:35] <rubiksdream> they said *sum* nonnegative
[00:23:36] <rubiksdream> not expression
[00:23:51] <rubiksdream> yeah
[00:23:51] <Kaylah> indeed, they refer to the summation only right?
[00:24:22] <rubiksdream> so the sum is an integer that is greater or equal to 1
[00:24:27] <rubiksdream> and f_i is less than 1
[00:25:42] <Kaylah> by sum you mean f_i minus the summation, right?
[00:25:48] <int-e> Well, (4) is equivalent to f_i - sum_j f_{ij}x_j <= 0. That seems unrelated to (3)...
[00:25:57] <Kaylah> I think I understand it though
[00:26:05] <rubiksdream> wait a sec, is f_i an integer?
[00:26:11] <Kaylah> no
[00:26:16] <Kaylah> or not necessarily
[00:26:29] <Kaylah> but I think I get it, imagine that f_i is 0.6 for instance
[00:26:42] <rubiksdream> ah right, yeah
[00:26:59] <Kaylah> in order for f_i - summation to be part of Z, the summation (given that it's not negative) must be 0.6, 1.6, 2.6, ...
[00:27:40] <Kaylah> so that f_i - summation would be either 0, -1, -2, ...
[00:27:45] <rubiksdream> right
[00:27:48] <Kaylah> or in other words <=0
[00:27:54] <Kaylah> and then (4) flows right out of that
[00:27:58] <rubiksdream> yup
[00:28:03] <Kaylah> thanks for helping me think about it!
[00:28:04] <rubiksdream> nice work
[00:29:48] <rubiksdream> i guess to summarize, f_i - whatever is an integer less than 1
[00:30:02] <rubiksdream> (because f_i < 1 and whatever is nonnegative)
[00:30:06] <Kaylah> indeed

[02:59:40] <Kaylah> but I'm not sure how to interpret |C|
[03:01:07] <somiaj> if C is a vector, |C| means the magnitude of the vector, which depends on the vecotr space
[03:01:55] <somiaj> oh looks like C isn't a vector, C is a cover (a set), so |C| means the number of elements in the set C
[03:02:01] <Kaylah> hmm yeah, would that be equal to sqrt(x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2) then?

[03:06:20] <Kaylah> so does C actually contain the values of j then, or how should I imagine this
[03:06:31] <Kaylah> if I wanted to write out an example of the C set
[03:06:46] <Kaylah> C = {2,5,6,8,12}
[03:07:29] *** specing_ is now known as specing
[03:07:33] <Kaylah> then that summation of a_j for j element of C would be equal to: a_2+a_5+a_6+a_8+a_12
[03:07:42] <Kaylah> is that correct?
[03:08:13] <int-e> Yes.
[03:08:36] <int-e> And that's equal to 0*a_1 + 1*a_2 + 0*a_3 + 0*a_4 + 1*a_5 + ...
[03:08:46] <int-e> So you can read off corresponding values for the x_i.
[03:08:57] <Kaylah> indeed, great
[03:09:29] <Kaylah> just one more thing I don't understand is why 1 is subtracted from |C| in the end
[03:10:39] <Kaylah> i would expect that summation on the left hand side to just be equal to |C|, because every x_j with j part of C is equal to 1, and we sum |C| of those x_j values together
[03:10:44] <int-e> Because for X itself, sum_{j in C} a_j > b, so it's not a solution to the knapsack problem.
[03:10:57] <int-e> Uh
[03:11:00] <int-e> For C itself, I mean.
[03:11:02] *** Joins: trinity (uid509475@user/trinity)
[03:11:02] <Kaylah> in fact I'd expect sum of all x_j's (also those outside of C) to be equal to |C| because the other x_j are just 0 anyway
[03:11:24] <Kaylah> hmmm
[03:11:34] <int-e> But every proper subset S \subset C is a solution. And those have cardinality at most |C|-1.

[03:13:14] <Kaylah> you mean what I said is not quite right?
[03:13:26] <int-e> Sorry, let me start over.
[03:13:48] <int-e> These x_i are not actually read off from C, they are a solution to the knapsack problem.
[03:13:56] <Kaylah> I think I was wrong to assume that the values of x_j correspond to whatever C is
[03:14:27] <Kaylah> C could contain 8 for instance but x_8 can still be 0, because x_j must correspond to one of the S subsets, not to the C subset if I understand it right
[03:14:30] <int-e> So what is being said there is that a solution of a knapsack problem cannot have x_i = 1 for all i in C, because that would push the sum of all x_i a_i above b.
[03:14:40] <Kaylah> ah yes indeed, as you just said :)
[03:15:21] <Kaylah> I guess we can also state that |S| <= |C| - 1
[03:15:40] <int-e> What does work, however, is reading off solutions from proper subsets of a minimal cover.

[03:20:14] <int-e> Huh. If you have a = (1,1,3) and b = 2, then C = {3} is the only minimal cover... but the optimal solution is {1,1}, and there's no /minimal/ cover containing {1,1} as a subset.

[13:40:17] <int-e> why are there 6 people?
[13:41:20] <kobalt> after removing the 2 people who don't like sitting together, we have 6 people remaining.

[16:06:57] <qergle> because i've done enough of these
[16:07:21] <greenbagels> yeah the complement trick is kind of a "once you learn it, you never forget it" rule
[16:07:34] <rubiksdream> because you can pick one of the clubs in 13 C 1 ways (say type 1) and then another club (type 2) and three other cards, or you can pick type 2 'first' and then type 1, and then the three other cards

[16:09:55] <greenbagels> not even visualize; i just don't understand how that helps / how to parse that
[16:10:15] <rubiksdream> fix a rectangle, take another rectangle that does not touch it outside it, and move the outer rectangle around in a circular path
[16:10:35] <kobalt> river: no a hand can have cards in any order.
[16:10:45] <rubiksdream> this corresponds to a loop in the coordinates (a_0,a_1,b_0,b_1), where say a_0,a_1 are the corners of the inner rectangle
[16:10:45] <river> ok :)
[16:11:30] <rubiksdream> so a_0,a_1 does not change through this loop, only b_0,b_1 coordinates

[16:12:48] <rubiksdream> im sure the commenter can do it, but purposely left it vague
[16:13:09] <river> I think the idea about hte loop is that it implies the original problem is difficult
[16:13:17] <kobalt> how do you recognize overcounting. Is there a generic technique.
[16:13:45] <cherim> If we had a fixed rectangle and a point instead of the second rectangle, then a topologist first thinks of the following
[16:14:03] <rubiksdream> kind of, you should know what your computation is counting kobalt , and sometimes a tree-diagram helps visualize this
[16:14:15] <cherim> For every position inside the rectangle create a ray in the direction of the gradient

[16:15:32] <greenbagels> kobalt: when you say overcounting do you mean like, when you have to reduce by some factor (like dividing by 2 in the doublecounting case)?
[16:15:42] <cherim> (It's constant on S^1 as boundary of D^1)
[16:15:44] <greenbagels> or like, when you're considering too many possible outcomes for the problem at hand, for some unrelated reason

[16:35:25] <greenbagels> i think my progress was basically; you know at an odd time you can't have the identity, so the probability for that sub-event is 0; but that means we have to show the probability that the identity shows up at some even time is 2/3
[16:36:05] <greenbagels> then i tried building up some formulae with some algorithmic thinking but my algorithm overcounted exponentially lol
[16:37:46] <river> "intutively" i would expect the probability of any given word occurring to be zreo
[16:37:52] <river> tend to zero
[16:38:08] <river> or less obtusely, i would expect the word length to tend to infinity

[17:14:59] <rubiksdream> greenbagels model the situation as a graph, start at the empty word, you can move to {a,a^{-1},b,b^{-1}} with equal probability, denote the probability you return to the empty word at some positive time as p. Now either you can move to one of {a,a^{-1},b,b^{-1}} and immediately move back to the empty word with probability 1/4, or you move to one of those and do not immediately return to the empty word, the first situation intersect 'return to empty word
[17:14:59] <rubiksdream> at positive time' happens with probability 1/4, the second intersect 'return to empty word at positive time' happens with probability p*1/4 by symmetry, so p satisfies p = 1/4 + p*1/4, hence p = 1/3

[17:25:13] <cherim> I don't like this reasoning
[17:25:28] <rubiksdream> whats wrong with it?
[17:26:22] <cherim> Williams starts with "naive probability works this way but we don't accept...", but let's assume you can indeed operate with probabilities this way
[17:26:34] <cherim> What is the logic behind p*(1/4) again?
[17:27:26] <cherim> You can assume the first move is to a, you have then 1/4 for immediate return
[17:27:43] <cherim> What is added later then should logically have a 3/4 factor
[17:28:07] <cherim> But let's just hear how you explain the p/4
[17:29:04] <rubiksdream> so p is computing the probability that starting from one of {a,a^{-1},b^{-1},b} , you return to the same state in positive time, and in exactly 1/4 of these move sequences (which are elements of the state space) the next move after some return brings you back to the empty word
[17:29:18] <int-e> Hmm, p = 1/4 + 3/4*p^2 seems easier to explain to me. Unfortunately that would allow for p=1.
[17:29:34] *** Quits: oxum (~oxum@122.172.205.112) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:29:41] <greenbagels> int-e: but p=1, so you can eliminate that solution
[17:29:46] <greenbagels> p clearly is not 1*
[17:29:48] <greenbagels> not p=1
[17:30:05] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@122.172.205.112)
[17:30:16] <cherim> It's not obvious, on a 2D lattice p=1
[17:30:29] <cherim> Despite a similar equation for p
[17:30:57] <greenbagels> how is it not obvious? the probability of returning to 1 at any odd time is 0
[17:31:00] <river> hm actually we can't use my idea of a generating function because it's not a regular language
[17:31:01] <river> nvm
[17:31:18] <greenbagels> so p is upper bounded by 1/2
[17:31:26] <cherim> p is the probability that a return ever happens
[17:31:34] <int-e> (p can be reinterpreted ad the probability that the last atom in a non-empty word ever gets deleted. This either happens immediately... that's the 1/4... or requires the same thing to happen twice after adding another atom.)
[17:31:39] <cherim> It doesn't care about at which time
[17:32:10] <int-e> And the latter gives the 3/4*p^2 part.
[17:32:17] <cherim> Once again, p=1 for the same problem but on a commutative free group, despite the same parity argument
[17:32:52] <int-e> Yeah I'm not agreeing that p!=1 is clear.
[17:32:59] <cherim> I know how to turn 3/4 p^2 into a working thing
[17:33:26] <cherim> But I just want to point out one shouldn't be tricked by saying something that leads to a correct answer
[17:33:36] <cherim> And looks "plausible"
[17:33:51] <cherim> p includes trajectories that return to origin many times
[17:34:12] <cherim> You will have a chance to do that 1/4 correct extra step not once

[17:40:40] <int-e> A bit of tedious technique will lead you to the smallest fixed point of p |-> 1/4 + 3/4*p^2, which is 1/3. But it spoinls what would otherwise be a very brief one-liner.

[17:41:20] *** Quits: kobalt (~rsonx@user/kobalt) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[17:42:49] <cherim> I think your argument may be saved simply by considering a modified process where the walk stops at the origin forever after reaching it once
[17:43:07] <cherim> But I myself would solve through the second part instead
[17:43:26] <cherim> You have an easy 1D walk on "distance to origin"

[17:43:58] *** Quits: oxum (~oxum@122.172.205.112) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:44:40] <int-e> You can assign a process to each i corresponding to p_0 = 0, p_(i+1) = 1/4 + 3/4(p_i)^2, basically limiting the depth and length of the path that returns you to the origin in somewhat weird ways... but such that in the end, all possible paths are covered. Then show that the limit of the p_i is the smallest fixed point of p |-> 1/4 + 3/4*p^2 (which it approaches from below).
[17:44:46] <Z-module> oh, and with the substructure containing that same 0 and 1 ?

[17:48:25] <cherim> You can simply consider gambler's ruin with a 1/4 positive step instead, p_i=3/4 p_{i+1} + 1/4 p_{i-1} with a simple exponential solution

[17:48:36] <dextaa> nvm guess it's pretty easy to see it can't be closed under + and 1
[17:49:29] <int-e> So P_0 = {}; P_(i+1) = {L} | {R} P_i P_i describes the paths corresponding to p_i.
[17:49:30] <cherim> If you want to be more rigorous, then consider finite cutoff (absorb at some finite distance) and show that the limit of the walk with finite cutoff is the same as the true walk on the infinite tree
[17:50:19] <int-e> This IFS stuff just behaves nicer than a cutoff at fixed distance, I think.
[17:51:01] <cherim> Gambler's ruin is only simpler without cutoff, provided you can exclude p=1
[17:51:05] <int-e> But it follows the same basic principle of considering increasingly large finite sets of paths that in the limit cover all possibilities of returning to the origin.
[17:51:18] <int-e> So it *is* fully rigorous.

[22:02:14] <droid3> hey guys still on a tangent about runtime analysis it seems they say quadratic sieve is the second fast prime factorization algorithm and fastest for numbers under 10^100
[22:02:35] <qergle> i think that's true, qs is 2nd only to gnfs
[22:02:44] <droid3> the general number field sieve is the fastest in general for numbers greater then 10^100
[22:03:11] <buster> xormor, i wouldn't if i were you. let's just ask qergle what point he wants to make with his question
[22:03:20] <droid3> But how do they come up with the runtime analysis i still not getting that aspect of both.
[22:03:27] <qergle> there might be some faster at smaller numbers, maybe ecm?
[22:03:54] <qergle> droid3: they analyze the algo
[22:04:15] <river> droid3: well it comes from analyzing how many steps the algorithm would take on average, its quite involved
[22:04:37] <droid3> Dixons factorization is comes with rigorous proof but the qs and gnfs seem to be based on a lot of opinions
[22:04:51] <qergle> assumptions rather
[22:04:55] <qergle> you mean about smootheness, etc?
[22:04:56] <river> it will involve number theory estimates of how likely things are to happen
[22:05:27] <qergle> so you generally use probabilistic bounds to get your asymptotic complexity
[22:05:50] <droid3> Ok so then did they reach these probabilities thru monte carlo simulations and numerically approximate a runtime bound from there
[22:06:13] <qergle> there's an entire branch of endevour dedicted to specifically this kind of analysis
[22:06:37] <droid3> Because at that point is kind of just assuming the runtime bounds fit the curve you simulated to. Which isnt completely accurate

[22:08:12] <droid3> But ya its cool it seems Dixons factorization is the one you can derive purely mathematically with no probabilities. But for alot of other B-smooth methods /algorithms for prime factorization like qs , gnfs ,...etc its not so cut and dry
[22:08:13] <qergle> it's not an "all the time" bound
[22:09:48] <droid3> Alot of these methods all use the same principal with B-smooth and factorbases. Yet the great performance benefit between one or the other is how you go about generating/finding good B-smooth numbers/factorbases
[22:09:49] <river> they would have the probabilities from number theory analysis
[22:10:09] <river> you couldn't trust data because what matters is when N is really large
[22:11:07] <droid3> ya but the probability greatly depends on the probability of finding B-smooth numbers/good factor bases. Which doesnt seem like one can theoretically compute this maybe just approximate it with probabilities/monte carlo methods
[22:12:47] <droid3> river agreed on that last statement of yours so there got to be proven probability approximation bounds for these things in different ways you go about generating B-smooth numbers/factor bases

[23:08:14] <betelgeuse> (i am still open to more suggestions for calc books)
[23:10:25] <buster> hey johnkeats6
[23:10:58] <betelgeuse> ive been looking at the reviews for spivak, because not much else is on the internet about it, people seem to praise it for being really difficult
[23:11:01] <betelgeuse> i never understood why "hardness" of a book is considered a benefit. presenting a brick wall to your reader and beating them up in general does not look to be an engaging style
[23:12:26] <somiaj> mawk: It is taught in a very applied way, more like Stewart, which many dissagree with (though I think stewart is a fine book too)
[23:12:49] <somiaj> It is just a far different focus, one is more mini anylsis, the other is more how to deal with more physics/engineering type computations
[23:13:07] <mawk> ah
[23:13:16] <somiaj> betelgeuse: Math is a contact support, having to work though the problems and figure it out is where the learning is at.
[23:13:17] <mawk> well for me calculus is a synonym for analysis
[23:13:20] <mawk> but apparently not
[23:13:46] <somiaj> betelgeuse: the hardness of spivak is not due to the book is made hard on purpose (it is extremly well written), it is that for most it approaches math in a far different way then they have been exposed to up to that point
[23:14:44] <somiaj> betelgeuse: It actually makes you think about what a real number is, defines how to prove things, and gives the foundations and reasons behidn why calculus work, not just teaches you how to compute derivatives and antiderivatives, so in the end it is harder than just learning a bunch of computations, but you get a better apprication and understanding of calculus as a result
[23:15:02] <somiaj> There is on magic/easy way to learn math, and it is better to invest the time to learn it right the first time
[23:16:22] <johnkeats6> spivak's calc on manifolds book is pretty bad though
[23:16:39] <johnkeats6> it's hard to imagine that's the same person who wrote the wonderful differential geometry books

[23:17:57] <betelgeuse> i agree that the fun part is working through problems; but it is usually accepted that a book develops understanding progressively, walking the reader through, rather than throwing them into cold water and asking them to help themselves with an unnecessarily hard question

[23:38:57] <betelgeuse> again, exposing the reader to an unreasonably hard question (without first letting them develop intuition and understanding around the subject through easier and more solvable questions) only alienates me

[23:59:19] <rubiksdream> we have a similar course given to first years at imperial, kevin buzzard makes the students do proofs in lean (its a first year course thats supposed to be a 'pre-real analysis' course' then they do a proper real analysis course which basically covers rudin up to forms in second year
[23:59:25] <Julius_> newpy, dont worry, I am used to being surrounded by non-thinkers
[23:59:36] <newpy> Julius_, usually lectures are bottlenecked not by the necessity of thought but other things like writing on a chalkboard
[23:59:48] <newpy> but it's ok, you can keep pretending to be smart
[23:59:50] <betelgeuse> newpy already said it but ill say it again, not everything in life requires full attention. not every sentence is filled with wisdom
