[03:23:16] <bpadalino> that's fine .. usually it does still print U or O to the terminal
[03:23:33] <bpadalino> alternatively, how are you synchronizing your PRBS ?
[03:23:57] <bpadalino> also, is this local loopback with a single radio, or between 2 different radios ?
[03:23:57] <Darth_Vader> hmm mine only displays the print-out statements from my source and sink
[03:24:26] <Darth_Vader> My hardware setup is a USRP N200 with a coax loopback between tx and rx
[03:24:47] <drmpeg> Darth_Vader: You can turn off that UHD thread priority warning by turning off "Realtime Scheduling" in GRC.
[03:24:49] <bpadalino> hopefully with an attenuator between or at least very low gain ?
[03:24:59] <warnes[m]> Are there any GR blocks for reading high-quality audio files?  I see the WAV file source, but is there a block for mp3 or AAC or such?
[03:25:21] <bpadalino> same clock, so no issues there .. but you still need synchronization from the TX PRBS and the RX PRBS
[03:25:27] <drmpeg> The WAV source does FLAC and Ogg Vorbis.
[03:25:36] <bpadalino> drmpeg: did you have a sox block at one point ?
[03:25:55] <drmpeg> I couldn't get that to work.
[03:25:59] <bpadalino> ah, bummer
[03:26:05] <Darth_Vader> drmpeg: my Realtime Scheduling is set off
[03:26:14] <drmpeg> You just can't stream into sox.
[03:26:44] <Darth_Vader> sox?
[03:26:57] <funkylab[m]> drmpeg: Thanks to you! 
[03:26:57] <funkylab[m]> Basically does anything that libsndfile does, which is a lot.
[03:27:31] <Darth_Vader> I found an OOT module for PRBS generation that I've been using
[03:27:44] <bpadalino> Darth_Vader: what about the receiving side? does it do that too ?
[03:28:00] <funkylab[m]> Darth_Vader: Why? GNU Radio comes with the xoroshiro prng.
[03:28:03] <warnes[m]> Ok, then the docs (and perhaps the name) should be updated, since neither says anything but WAV.
[03:28:54] <Darth_Vader> funkylab[m]: What is xoroshiro prng? I'm a noob to gnuradio (college student).
[03:29:10] <funkylab[m]> You know what a prbs does
[03:29:26] <Darth_Vader> yes, I'm using it for bit error rate analysis
[03:29:35] <funkylab[m]> Great!
[03:32:31] <funkylab[m]> So, you can use the uniform random source in GNU Radio to do the same
[03:32:43] <funkylab[m]> It generates a pseudorandom bit sequence
[03:33:09] <Darth_Vader> Well, I'm working on using it for bit error rate analysis haha. I've successfully used the OOT module to generate a sequence of PRBS data, corrupted it, and then performed BER to ensure I understand concepts behind PRBS. I'm now working on integrating it with my hardware
[03:33:34] <Darth_Vader> Oh thank you
[03:33:59] <funkylab[m]> Slightly different method than the generators underlying things that are typically called "PRBS", but both theoretically and practically better.
[03:35:00] <funkylab[m]> Theoretically, because the sequence length (before it repeats) is much longer, and the correlation properties much whiter, 
[03:35:01] <bpadalino> Darth_Vader: how are you synchronizing your reception before calculating your BER ?
[03:35:10] <Darth_Vader> So using the uniform random source in GNU Radio would achieve the same thing. Awesome!
[03:35:16] <funkylab[m]> Practically because it just comes with GNU radio out of the box
[03:35:58] <funkylab[m]> As bpadalino says, though, the hard part is not generating the same sequence on transmitter and receiver
[03:36:24] <funkylab[m]> The hard part is letting the receiver find the point where it starts
[03:36:27] <warnes[m]> @drmpeg Odd, the `blocks_wavefile_sink.block.yml` on github seems to be different than the one I have installed...
[03:36:43] <funkylab[m]> warnes[m]: Release?
[03:36:55] <drmpeg> It's only in 3.9 and later.
[03:36:59] <warnes[m]> 3.10
[03:37:12] <Darth_Vader> I'm not. My connections are: "PRBS source -> GSFK Mod -> UHD:USRP Sink" and "USRP: UHD Source -> GFSK Demod -> PRBS Sink"
[03:37:33] <Darth_Vader> bpadalino
[03:37:49] <funkylab[m]> Ah what does the prbs sink do, internally?
[03:38:01] <bpadalino> heh, yeah, synchronize your sequence then ..
[03:38:49] <Darth_Vader> funkylab[m]: generates another PRBS sequence and compares the received data using an xor gate
[03:39:55] <Darth_Vader> And then it tallies them
[03:40:45] <Darth_Vader> Any advice for methods of synchronization?
[03:41:01] <funkylab[m]> Yeah, I'd have expected it to synchronize, but if it doesn't do that, then you're simply not comparing the same bits, but a shifted sequence
[03:41:45] <Darth_Vader> That's what I was thinking. I planned to save my generated data and received data in files and compare them in matlab
[03:42:29] <bpadalino> Darth_Vader: write a state machine that searches for a few bits in a row that match with a stable starting point ..
[03:42:37] <bpadalino> then continue to the next bits
[03:42:53] <bpadalino> you can try something like 16 predicted bits in a row to get to a locked state
[03:42:58] <bpadalino> and then start your count ..
[03:43:05] <drmpeg> warnes[m] I'm not sure what's going on there. It matches up here, but I always build from source.
[03:43:50] <Darth_Vader> ok thank you. Just curious, are all of you electrical engineers, hobbyists, or both?
[03:44:12] <bpadalino> engineer
[03:44:16] <drmpeg> The WAV file source block auto detects the format.
[03:44:59] <drmpeg> I guess I'm both engineer and hobbyist.
[03:45:24] <bpadalino> yeah, i never got a license so if i transmit i'm always a pirate
[03:46:23] <Darth_Vader> Gotcha same. I want to get a HAM license someday...once I buy a pair of overalls

[05:08:23] <warnes[m]> FYI:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/01d94ff166f3b03b22c05e99babd49476be1fd15)
[05:09:54] <drmpeg> Unfortunately, the ffmpeg command line can be painful.
[05:11:42] <drmpeg> It doesn't like that file.
[05:12:20] <drmpeg> Is it DRM'd?
[05:12:31] <warnes[m]> Probably.
[05:12:51] <warnes[m]> I pulled it from the Apple Music folder.
[05:13:33] <patchvonbraun[m]> Devils Rancid Machinations.
[05:13:52] <drmpeg> I don't think that will work.
[05:15:14] *** Quits: balrog (znc@user/balrog) (Quit: Bye)
[05:18:01] <warnes[m]> Yeah, I see.  <Shrug> I just needed an example file for testing, and the one you provided will woork fine.
[05:18:16] <warnes[m]> s/woork/work/, s/./, thanks!/

[05:32:34] <warnes[m]> drmpeg: For FM encode/decode of that file, what Audio and Quadrature rates do you recommend?
[05:33:38] <drmpeg> It's 96k.
[05:34:01] <drmpeg> Usually a 4X quadrature rate.
[05:34:33] <drmpeg> Then a rational resampler to some rate your SDR can handle.
[05:35:03] <warnes[m]> Ok, Thanks.
[05:37:20] <drmpeg> Maybe 5:1 resampler to 1.92 Msps.
[05:40:04] <drmpeg> This is a good flow graph to get working transmitters from. https://github.com/argilo/sdr-examples/blob/master/multi_tx.grc
[05:52:06] <warnes[m]> Looks like it's from an older version of GR, I'll have to update the missing UI blocks.
[05:53:01] <drmpeg> Yeah, it's from 3.7. Should auto convert except for the WX blocks.
[05:54:21] <warnes[m]> Yep, replacing those now.
[05:54:43] <warnes[m]> I can send or PR the update version if that is helpful.

[05:55:17] <drmpeg> Sure. Clayton hangs out here.
[05:55:38] <drmpeg> He's also the keeper of Gqrx now.
[05:56:12] <ic3blx_> what's this? a radio station, right?
[05:57:00] <drmpeg> No, it's for software defined radio discussion.
[05:57:37] <ic3blx_> beautiful, just what I was looking for

[14:21:37] <duude__> drmpeg: Right, but how would I make it appear on a larger magnitude of frequencies?
[14:21:53] <duude__> I could do a ton of add+multiply gates, but that's going to bog down the cpu a lot
[14:23:14] <duude__> Like.. Make it appear 10 times, let's say
[14:23:19] <duude__> Or 15.. 20.. etc
[14:23:59] <tnt> what do you mean repeat multiple times ? Like in the frequency domain ?
[14:24:04] <tnt> or in the time domain ?

[16:20:36] <tnt> L means "late"
[16:21:31] <mobizmn[m]> tnt: Is this mentioned in any documentation?

[16:27:23] <mobizmn[m]> tnt: ah great! thanks!
[16:41:28] <duude__> tnt: Well, both, honestly
[16:41:44] <duude__> In the frequency domain if you want me to be precise
[16:42:41] <duude__> For example, I have a sinusoidal signal of unimportant amplitude and other parts. All that I'm looking at is it's frequency at the moment.
[16:42:51] <duude__> let's say it's 10 megahertz
[16:43:16] <duude__> So now, I'd like to have that same signal appear from 10-30 megahertz for example
[16:43:24] <duude__> let's say, 10,11,12,13,14....30
[16:43:58] <duude__> Or, perhaps 10,13,16...31
[16:44:17] <duude__> Or completely variable like..
[16:44:30] <duude__> 10.4, 11, 11.5, 16.3, 19.5 etc
[16:51:40] <drmpeg> You could do it with an IFFT.

[16:52:04] <duude__> Thanks :)
[16:52:57] <drmpeg> But the interval has to be fixed.
[16:54:09] <duude__> I see
[16:56:15] <drmpeg> Here's something to get you started. https://www.w6rz.net/iffttest.grc
[16:56:49] <drmpeg> I think it's what you're talking about.
[16:57:51] <drmpeg> You would change the spacing by changing the sample rate.
[16:58:48] <drmpeg> And you can turn individual tones on/off with the vector sink values.

[21:09:55] <Yamakaja[m]> https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR
[21:10:50] <dcajacob[m]> pybombs seems to be trying to install 3.8
[21:11:04] <dcajacob[m]> So, is pybombs abandoned?
[21:12:18] <Yamakaja[m]> I don't think so, but neither can i help you with PYBOMS, because i've never actually used it 😅

[21:14:54] <jogn_1[m]> dcajacob[m]: This might help you out. https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR ;)
[21:14:54] <jogn_1[m]> Ah... yamka already posted the link here lol
[21:14:54] <jogn_1[m]> my bad
[21:15:25] <dcajacob[m]> I have looked at that, of course. It doesn't answer the question unfortunately.
[21:16:06] <Yamakaja[m]> Do you need to use a source install? Using the PPA will be much easier
[21:16:34] <dcajacob[m]> The latest PPA is 3.8.something which has broken gr-fec
[21:16:36] <dcajacob[m]> So, I need to do source
[21:17:02] <Yamakaja[m]> I'm not sure how you've come to that conclusion: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR#Ubuntu_PPA_Installation

[21:17:32] <dcajacob[m]> Trust me. I'm on ubuntu 21.10
[21:17:38] <dcajacob[m]> It probably works on 21.04
[21:17:42] <jogn_1[m]> dcajacob[m]: ^
[21:18:16] <dcajacob[m]> I don't mean to be rude guys, but I've read all that and tried it.
[21:18:43] <dcajacob[m]> The PPA is broken in 21.10
[21:19:08] <dcajacob[m]> or the packages don't even exist
[21:19:11] <dcajacob[m]> not sure which
[21:19:11] <Yamakaja[m]> So either the PPA is broken or something went wrong on your side? Is anyone else using the PPA here? I tend to install from source
[21:22:46] <noc0lour_> I think someone pointed the broken PPA out before
[21:22:54] <Yamakaja[m]> Ah yes, so there is no package for your Ubuntu Version, so it falls back to the default 3.8 one from Ubuntu
[21:23:13] <DerekKozel[m]> Hey Dan. The PPA probably needs checking given the recent releases
[21:23:30] <dcajacob[m]> Yeah. I'd settle for 3.9
[21:24:03] <dcajacob[m]> And I'm happy to build from source, but it's been a while. Is pybombs supported for 3.9+?
[21:24:23] <DerekKozel[m]> We're still looking for an Ubuntu maintainer. 
[21:24:32] <dcajacob[m]> Seems like out of the box, it tries 3.8
[21:24:33] <DerekKozel[m]> I don't use pybombs, but it has worked for 3.9 
[21:25:09] <DerekKozel[m]> I think there's a flag? 
[21:25:13] <neelpandeya[m]> dcajacob: I just sent you a DM
[21:26:14] <patchvonbraun[m]> The packaged GR+friends for Ubuntu 21.10 is 3.8.2.  That's what I use, but, yeah, if you need 3.9, its' PPA or build from soruce.
[21:31:18] <dcajacob[m]> patchvonbraun: I was using that. And found out that CC encoder/decoder is broken :(
[21:31:23] <dcajacob[m]> So, off to source we goooooo!
[21:32:14] <noc0lour_> dcajacob[m]: They need a lot of hand holding to get right even when they are not broken
[21:33:19] <dcajacob[m]> I know what I'm doing. The straight up examples are broken.
[21:33:51] <dcajacob[m]> And I'm pretty sure I found documented evidence that this was indeed broken in 3.8.something
[21:35:18] <noc0lour_> dcajacob[m]: that I'm sure about

[21:43:46] <BarryDuggan[m]> Let me know if you have any problems. I help maintain the wiki pages.
[21:45:02] <JoshMorman[m]> dcajacob: does it seem related to https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio/issues/2642
[21:46:30] <dcajacob[m]> Josh Morman: Yeah, I saw something that indicated there was some problem in the underlying volk kernel
[21:46:46] <dcajacob[m]> I'm just assuming it's fixed in a newer build
[21:46:58] <JoshMorman[m]> I'm not sure those volk kernels were ever fixed.
[21:47:23] <dcajacob[m]> Barry Duggan: Yep. I haven't tried that yet. Was trying to figure out if pybombs was up to the task first since that manages the installation nicely
[21:47:57] <JoshMorman[m]> You can force the kernel over to VOLK_GENERIC
[21:48:39] <dcajacob[m]> Yeah, I think I saw that. Can you do that with package builds?
[21:49:14] <dcajacob[m]> In any event, feels like a good time to move up the the latest shit
[21:49:38] <dcajacob[m]> But my build fails early with GR :(

[21:54:43] <dcajacob[m]> Saw the same error when I was building 3.8
[21:55:07] <Yamakaja[m]> NUMPY_FOUND = FALSE, did you install numpy?
[21:55:13] <dcajacob[m]> Is this companing that it wants python3.6?
[21:55:36] <dcajacob[m]> I definitely have numpy installed
[21:55:39] <dcajacob[m]> Use it all the time
[21:55:44] <Yamakaja[m]> For python 3?
[21:56:01] <dcajacob[m]> and pybombs should be installing it anyhow, right?
[21:56:05] <JoshMorman[m]> If it is the latest, it also needs python3-packaging installed
[21:57:17] <dcajacob[m]> Josh Morman: OK, just installed that one. New one for me.
[21:58:01] <dcajacob[m]> It looks like it's complaining that I have python 3.9 and not 3.6?
[21:58:08] <patchvonbraun[m]> I have numpy 1.19-5 on my 21.10 system here.
[21:59:02] <dcajacob[m]> I mean, if I run python3, I can import numpy
[21:59:29] <dcajacob[m]> Same error after adding python3-packaging
[22:00:00] <patchvonbraun[m]> Do not meddle in the affairs of {arbitrary selected build system} for you are crunchy, and good with ketchup.
[22:00:29] <dcajacob[m]> Wise words
[22:00:55] <dcajacob[m]> Feels like maybe this gnuradio39.lwr recipe is broken?
[22:01:00] <patchvonbraun[m]> I miss the days when you could capture the entire configuration management problem inside a single Make file...
[22:01:13] <patchvonbraun[m]> Get Off My Lawn :)
[22:01:21] <dcajacob[m]> I miss the days when you had a single file to fix all my build woes ;)
[22:01:49] <dcajacob[m]> Does everyone still just run 3.8?
[22:02:26] <patchvonbraun[m]> I was still running 3.7 until very recently.  But I don't come even close to being a proxy for "everyone".
[22:03:20] <dcajacob[m]> I'm guessing 21.10 doesn't support 3.6 very well anymore or some bullshit
[22:04:03] <JoshMorman[m]> We have Fedora 35 in our CI which is python 3.10
[22:04:59] <BarryDuggan[m]> Josh Morman: is python3-packaging needed for 3.10 build from source?
[22:05:31] <JoshMorman[m]> Yes, it is now a requirement
[22:05:43] <BarryDuggan[m]> I'll add that to the wiki
[22:06:31] <patchvonbraun[m]> I'll note that I have python3-packaging on my 21.10 system.  I don't recall explicitly installing it, but it may have come in with other things.
[22:08:45] <dcajacob[m]> Right, but even after installing it, I got the same error...

[22:29:38] <muaddib[m]> I usually use the gitrev flag when I run pybombs install. I can’t remember the command off hand.
[22:30:06] <muaddib[m]> That goes for any out of trees in a given environment

[22:59:03] <willcode4[m]> dcajacob: If you init pybombs without a recipe, then change <prefix>/.pybombs/config.yml to have `gitbranch: maint-3.10`, it should work. The "build everything now" recipes need some attention.
