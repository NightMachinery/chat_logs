[06:19:16] <TJ-> Codaraxis: the thing is the split has to be understood by the tools that /read/ the file, so obviously something has changed there. Either a package update, or a configuration change, or a process simply running out of memory or similar. If there's an in-memory cache messed up, restarting the controlling service might clear the issue

[07:10:52] <Codaraxis> TJ-, One final realization as I do more poking around. The NIS map, group.byname, only contain the last instance of a group from /etc/groups . So, when executing groups on the master, it uses the full group file; however, clients only have access to the mapfile and as such, the shortened list.

[07:20:31] <aphos> @uwharrie It seems when the config option "Enable unused/obsoleted exported symbols" replaced "Trim unused exported kernel symbols" a bug was introduced.

[08:22:28] <chives> only problem i got with vi is there are so many variants
[08:22:52] <[[R]]> yes, because giving pepoe the choice of what editor to use is the worst sin ever
[08:22:53] <rascul> usually the vi problem is how to quit
[08:22:55] <neshpion> the only variants i know of are vim and nvim, and usually vi is actually just a symlink to vim
[08:23:05] <chives> [[R]]: well the problem is they are all called vi or vim

[08:23:22] <iflema> rascul: no, its quitting other editors
[08:23:23] <ekaj> i'm only familar with OG vi and vim; as neshpion said vi is usually symlinked to vim

[08:24:08] <iflema> thats works - the vi problems is how to quit
[08:24:22] <ekaj> mash escape then :q
[08:24:43] <chives> so you got to read a howto from the 90's on how to use your current vi wth
[08:24:43] <rascul> the proper way to quit vi is to hold the power button until the computer powers off, then turn it back on and uninstall that crap
[08:24:46] <ekaj> press it at least 5x, more eective that way
[08:24:58] <rascul> (same with vim)
[08:25:05] <ekaj> rascul: you joke, but first time i opened vi on a desktop i had to do that
[08:25:19] <rascul> i am joking ;)

[12:02:13] <DPA> It seams I can't do anything about the fsck failing right now, my raid is recovering the next 3-4 days. (It's a raid 6, and I just replaced 1 fully failed disks, and am currently adding 1 and gracefully replacing 1). But I managed to fix the mount issue.
[12:02:13] <DPA> There was a partial drive failure a week before that, where I stopped the LXC containers where I had bind mounted the same raid device, and remounted it ro on the main server / host, before mounting it after I replaced that failed drive to attempt the fsck (I have 1 drive redundancy now until the 2nd is fully added).
[12:02:13] <DPA> It turns out, it probably didn't unmount cleanly. I was able to mount the drive as ro again, and then remount it as rw (which seams to affect all mountpoints for f2fs).
[12:02:13] <DPA> So I'll just have to wait for my raid to finish recovery in 3-4 days, then need to reboot it without mounting md2, then fsck-ing md2, and then mount it normally.

[13:45:20] <roxlu> hi, when reading from a serial device, what's a proper way to detect if someone disconnects/reconnects the device/cable?
[13:45:28] <roxlu> in software I mean
[13:46:05] <programmar> geirha: yes but in the case you said, we can still just have /usr/bin only without /bin, even with symlink, absolute paths will still break if /usr/bin disappears tho since /bin is linked to it

[13:49:18] <geirha> programmar: yeah, in my head it was don the other way, but the same applies. Many scripts will have #!/bin/bash or #!/bin/sh as shebang. If /bin disappears, those would stop working

[17:38:26] <Psi-Jack> 2GB is MORE Than enough swap. If you EVER need more than that, you need more RAM, not more swap. Period. Hibernation is the ONE exception to this, however, hibernation support in Linux is literally crap right now, and getting worse. Not getting much attention.
[17:38:51] <|\n> well it depends, everything is consensus
[17:39:04] <akik> Psi-Jack: do you know why hibernation is "crap" ? secure boot doesn't support it
[17:39:07] <Psi-Jack> Ali-Karam: Fedora does an interesting thing about swap these days. They do specifically swap on zram, with a small portion of RAM.
[17:39:09] <djph> Ali-Karam: more that the system tries to avoid swapping active pages (so since compiling is an active process, RAM necessary for compiling will generally not get swapped out)
[17:39:16] <Psi-Jack> akik: No, that's not why.
[17:39:23] <akik> Psi-Jack: yes, yes it is

The main complaint that Linus Torvalds and Andy Lutomirski had a year ago was about that linkage; they felt that it was unreasonable to force those using secure boot into having a locked-down kernel—and vice versa.

[19:17:16] <Psi-Jack> Yeah, I've been seeing you talking about this for days, and yeah, it's.... Unusual.

[19:17:51] <ayecee> right
[19:17:56] <hexnewbie> That problem is so weird it *almost* means there has to be something wrong with both ddrescue *and* the CIFS client performing the mount.
[19:18:02] <Dagmar> Well, for most people it's either ddrescue or just accepting the data loss and moving on
[19:18:17] <Psi-Jack> Or just better backups. 🙂

[19:18:44] <Psi-Jack> Exactly!
[19:18:53] <hexnewbie> I moved my backups from /dev/full to /dev/null so they would no longer fail 😜
[19:18:55] <ayecee> my guess is that it's on the server side, in the samba server on the nas, that it doesn't finish syncing the file when the client disconnects
[19:19:01] <schillingklaus> as already known by torvald, the best backup consists in opening the server for public ftp and let the whole world mirror it
[19:19:04] <ayecee> except in this case the client doesn't disconnect.
[19:19:10] <Dagmar> Ergo if someone's using ddrescue, they probably don't have backups, and you'd be dumb to question why they're using ddrescue
[19:19:24] <THE_GFR|WORK> ayecee: I guess I could wait and see

[19:19:49] <Psi-Jack> I would recommend a rescue disk, a NAS, or external HDD, and dd.
[19:19:50] <THE_GFR|WORK> I use ddrescue to do backups of good drives to an image file "just in case"
[19:19:54] <Psi-Jack> Not ever would I recommend ddrescue.
[19:19:59] <Dagmar> ddrescue does a lot of seeks() but it doesn't do anything that I'm aware of that would cause it to truncate the whole file

[19:20:21] <THE_GFR|WORK> Dagmar: indeed in my experience it wouldn't either
[19:20:25] <Psi-Jack> THE_GFR|WORK: Because it's silly. You can normalize and have better backups without wasting so much space with a massive image.
[19:20:25] <ayecee> THE_GFR|WORK: worth a try. i mean, you've waited around after completion without disconnecting the client and it didn't seem to have an effect, but maybe waiting longer would do it.
[19:20:37] <Dagmar> THE_GFR: There isn't really any point in using ddrescue on good media.
[19:20:43] <Dagmar> LIke, none.
[19:20:44] <hexnewbie> ddrescue has resume, has better defaults, and handles read errors much better.
[19:20:56] <ayecee> three points right there
[19:21:10] <Dagmar> It won't run significantly faster than dd, and it's not like dd will ignore read errors.
[19:21:15] <THE_GFR|WORK> Dagmar: there is when I am working on a system and might want to revert to the previous state and can't do a different kind of backup
[19:21:22] <THE_GFR|WORK> ayecee: indeed
[19:21:28] <THE_GFR|WORK> hexnewbie: indeed

[19:22:16] <Psi-Jack> THE_GFR|WORK: My backup solution, in simple terms, snapshots a copy of installed repositories, repo keys, and installed packages, to a replayable file. Backs up /etc, and important directories containing data and configuration. Dumpping properly where needed. And using borgbackup for example, to actually retain the data. I have 3 physical servers that over the course of 1 year, has literally less than 500MB for an entire year's worth of daily backups for
[19:22:16] <Psi-Jack> a year's worth, with prunes per week, per month, and year.

[19:22:37] <ayecee> THE_GFR|WORK: i wonder if mounting the remote dir a different way, like with sshfs, would produce the same result.

[19:40:35] <tintedfireglass> brand doesnt matter , only the product matters
[19:40:40] <Dagmar> Because Dell hardware is "cheap" not "quality"
[19:40:54] <jim> greatcoof, replace it with what?
[19:40:56] <tgarder> I used to have a dual monitor setup before, one turd monitor and one good, just to make sure colors worked for people with like 12 year old crap monitors.. was pretty good though, I must admit
[19:41:04] <THE_GFR|WORK> Dagmar: then why do I have so many dead "other brand" screens and really old working Dell screens?
[19:41:09] <greatcoof> jim: hurd maybe
[19:41:18] <Dagmar> You can be sure that when you buy Dell, you're getting exactly what they said, and anything they didn't say will have been cut if it can save them a penny
[19:41:27] <|\n> unfortunately that's not exactly true, because some brands to afraid of lawsuits and change policies worldwide and some brands don't - in all senses
[19:41:38] <akik> greatcoof: you'll be in a world of hurd
[19:41:42] <jim> greatcoof, probably worth it as an experiment
[19:41:51] <THE_GFR|WORK> Dagmar: I have to say the matte screens I have from Dell are really great, and just work a really long time
[19:41:55] <tintedfireglass> Dagmar : Im using a 15year old dell laptop now  , it works pretty well, the brand doesnt dictate the quality of the product , the product itself does. There are many trash dell products but does it mean dell sucks? You can say that
[19:42:01] <Dagmar> THE_GFR: Perhaps you've spent too much money buying from cheap-vendors who are _certain_ you're not shipping the display back to Malaysia for an RMA
[19:42:02] <|\n> thus of 2 brands that package same hw guts one may proceed with smooth RMA, the other - won't in one of the contries where it operates
[19:42:16] <jim> but don't format your linux hd before you decide if you like hurd
[19:42:21] <Dagmar> tintedfireglass: I can say that because I've been dealing with hardware for a lot longer than 15 years.
[19:42:36] <Dagmar> Dell cuts corners.  It's literally how they've gotten to where they are.
[19:42:44] <Dagmar> Quality is not their priority.
[19:42:51] <Dagmar> Profits are their priority.
[19:42:54] <tintedfireglass> both ideas makes sense hmmmm....
[19:43:02] <THE_GFR|WORK> Dagmar: Samsung, AOC, HP, Emprex, and more are dead but the Dell ones are fine
[19:43:08] <THE_GFR|WORK> anyhow I am not here to debate that
[19:43:08] <tintedfireglass> Dagmar: coprorations exist to profit lol
[19:43:13] <Dagmar> Emprex lol
[19:43:17] <Dagmar> Your opinions are invalid.
[19:43:28] <tgarder> gotta say all the coders at work are super happy with dell XPS though
[19:43:29] <THE_GFR|WORK> Dagmar: HP cuts way  more corners than Dell ever does

[23:48:39] <Entelin> If I have a folder that has user/group = scans/scans, I have many users which are members of group scans. Files are written into this folder by user scans, how can I force the permissions of files created in this folder to be 660 ? Currently they are 644 which doesn't allow group members to delete these files, and allows permission to other which is not desired.
[23:48:41] <PaulFertser> spaceone: another idea: you start a tcpdump on a machine that's connected to the switch. Then physically disconnect the target machine from the switch, wait for a few seconds and connect it back. You should see some broadcast traffic from it.
[23:49:28] <Dagmar> Entelin: `chmod 2770 dirname` as root
