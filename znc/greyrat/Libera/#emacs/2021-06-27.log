[00:14:23] <dminuoso> Do emacs users generally use key bindings for most things? I find it hard to build up muscle memory, command names (For M-x) seem to be easier to remember.

[00:14:50] <splntr> no your not ;)
[00:15:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Common keybinds get used directly, otherwise fuzzy-completion makes m-x usage quite convenient.

[05:08:14] <Wafficus> hey there, I need some help with setting up IRC via ERC in my config. I followed a related Reddit post on how to do it, and pretty much have a close match of what they had present in their config: https://bpa.st/7KIQ

[07:35:05] <johnjay> eventfd syscall is Linux-specific, without good alternative on macOSApple does not support Vulkan, which is needed for DXVKApple deprecated OpenGL support, which is needed for WineD3D
[07:35:22] <johnjay> so i guess it might take some work to get proton working which would also apply to wine

[08:03:21] <bpalmer> nowadays with all the networked games, gaming consoles are much less trustworthy.
[08:03:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Game DRM and anti-cheat has very little to do with AI
[08:03:54] *** Quits: unlockd (~unl0ckd@user/unl0ckd) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[08:04:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Yeah. That's why I split off my gaming machine from the rest of my network.
[08:05:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Anti-cheat is basically a bunch of rootkits. One has to assume the machine they're played on is compromised.
[08:06:28] <bpalmer> Mostly, I just don't play multiplayer games that care about cheating.
[08:06:55] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That helps, though some games include them anyway because they have a multiplayer mode (which is uninteresting) and a single-player mode.
[08:07:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If I buy a game because I want to play the campaign/scenario, I don't care about multiplayer 90% of the time. So there's no point to that mode.
[08:08:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> The remaining 10% is pretty much entirely taking over by RTSes and other strategy game.s

[08:13:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They simply shouldn't sell themselves as anything else though.
[08:13:39] <johnjay> yeah i get that. i just have a hard time mentally justifying paying for something like that
[08:13:49] <johnjay> i guess because there's no guarantee you would find people to play with

[08:14:10] <aidalgol> Right, that's why I usually nag my friends to buy the co-op games at the same time. :P
[08:14:14] <jgkamat> I'm pretty sure the reason they sell themselves as singleplayer games is that the marketing department wants to have as much stuff as possible to sell you on

[08:14:57] <jgkamat> lol yeah :P 
[08:15:00] <Aurora_v_kosmose> jgkamat: Yeah, but that hinges on the disconnect they have from the userbase where a game that obviously has most of its budget spent in multiplayer generally has terrible single-player and will be sent for refunds.
[08:15:11] <bpalmer> johnjay: good multiplayer games will make it easy to match you up against anonymous participants of similar skill, filling in with bots during slow times.

[08:16:21] <bpalmer> (there's a real problem of playing 'with friends' when there's a wide range of skill involved -- imagine trying to organize a pickup basketball game when one of your friends is an NBA rookie)
[08:16:40] <jgkamat> IMO getting info on games from game publishers is inherently flawed - much better to wait for lots of reviews and other stuff like that from people who actually play the game

[08:23:00] <aidalgol> I think the broader issue is there is waaaaay too much you can get away with in contract law.
[08:23:15] <jgkamat> yeah, IMO it hinges on if games are a product or a service 
[08:23:49] <johnjay> some games are clearly a service, like world of warcraft
[08:23:55] <johnjay> like you literally pay a monthly fee to use it
[08:24:47] <jgkamat> yeah, those make sense, but cash-up-front games could be a service too. Although IANAL so I have no idea what I'm talking about :P 
[08:25:23] <johnjay> sure, if it's a server maintained to host the multiplayer
[08:25:38] <johnjay> but if there's no server it's just bits on your pc and they don't have an upkeep cost it's not really a service
[08:25:56] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I think multiplayer game should release server binaries as much as feasible.
[08:26:03] <jgkamat> ^
[08:26:04] <aidalgol> That's another sneaky trap for them.  "Sorry, keeping the multiplayer servers running is no longer profitable, so that game you bought two years ago is now useless."

[10:28:56] <defanor> I'm thinking of glueing a bright LED strip to kitchen cabinets, but not sure if the cabinets and the LEDs will be okay with the heat (or whether a metal heat sink is needed). How does one go about estimating that? I know it's at most 13.5 W per meter (if everything went into heat), which is coming from 120 SMDs per meter, 2.8*3.5 mm each -- so about 0.12 W per 9.8 mm^2, but don't know what to do with that. And just failing to find any

[10:36:36] <pjb> defanor: note that usually you can touch kitchen cabinet, so the temperature is never too high.  Therefore the LED should bear it easily.
[10:37:42] <glyph> pjb: I think defanor's concern is about damage to the cabinet, not damage to the LED
[10:37:46] <defanor> pjb: Oh, I'm worried about the heat coming the other way around: from LEDs to kitchen cabinets, possibly setting them on fire.
[10:38:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> LEDs are supposed to be too weak for that.
[10:38:15] <defanor> But also LEDs damaging themselves with a high heat from themselves.

[10:38:48] <defanor> Yeah, but these are relatively bright ones. I know people glue 5 W and 10 W per meter ones commonly, but not sure about brighter ones.
[10:39:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That's a good point.
[10:40:19] <pjb> defanor: LED produce almost no heat.
[10:40:25] <defanor> The suggested task lighting for kitchen food preparation areas is 50 footcandles (roughly 500 lux), and it's about 2 times brighter in electronics manufacturing standards (1000 lux), so I'd rather like brighter ones there.

[11:13:09] <defanor> Will try one wiring-related question here too: I'm rather tired of wires being hidden in walls; moving or adding outlets, passing new wires, fixing wiring, or even making holes in walls is a pain and damages walls. It always seemed silly to me to embed these maintenance-requiring things into walls, just as cementing pipes or embedding electronics into furniture. So I'm considering more "commercial"/"indurstial" wiring at least for the
[11:13:10] <defanor> kitchen: perhaps exposed cable raceways under the ceiling, and/or inside of mouldings, as they do in office buildings. Are there apparent drawbacks to consider, and are there known resources with information on such setups around? I've been looking for guides/articles/etc for a couple of days now, but haven't found much; mostly marketing materials for companies manufacturing some of the relevant bits.

[11:17:54] <defanor> I was thinking of running them conduits or something like that. Sadly, I'm pretty sure that the ones hidden in walls rarely adhere to regulations, which is one of the annoyances I had with them.

[13:21:48] <Viking667> Mind you, my first real arcade game experience wasn't Tetris, nor was it even Space Invaders. It was Gauntlet. First fantasy-themed arcade machine that I first saw in the late eighties and fell in love with the theme music.
[13:21:50] <bpalmer> rdrg109: technically, it's not impossible, it just requires a lot more work.
[13:21:52] *** Joins: asymptotically (~asymptoti@gateway/tor-sasl/asymptotically)
[13:22:16] <Viking667> rdrg109: I'd say "digest: no"
[13:22:51] <bpalmer> rdrg109: in practice, though, yes; choosing digest means you're not planning on doing much replying.

[13:23:17] <Viking667> And if there's a "In-reply-to: " header that isn't the mailing list, then you could presumably use that, but you'd better CC it to the ML.
[13:23:19] <bpalmer> (listserv and mailman don't do much to help with this ; google groups has a slightly more polished experience in that you can use a web interface to reply to particular messages)
[13:23:32] <rdrg109> bpalmer: What does "more work" imply? Would that be equivalent to using Django for creating a single page site?

[13:24:58] <Viking667> ^^^ yes, that ^^^

[13:28:06] <Viking667> does listserv/mailman/chimptastic do that?
[13:28:11] <bpalmer> In theory, good mail clients will support one or both. I know gnus does. But not sure about any of the others.
[13:28:48] <bpalmer> in practice, I don't think that's been a focus for any "new" mail client in a long time.

[18:04:15] <junction> Hello. I'm using rustic-mode and I'd improve the behaviour when I press return. When I type `fn action() {|}`, after typing the first {, the matching } is inserted and the cursor is left in between both. If I press return, I want the closing brace to be placed two lines below the `fn` and the cursor in between both, indented. Does this style have a name? This is the behaviour if I define a function in c-mode, for example

[18:11:39] <bpalmer> junction: I just tested this in emacs -nw -q , and I don't see either of that behavior , which makes me think you may be using some additional configuration for C mode.
[18:12:04] <bpalmer> junction: I don't know rustic; one way to do what you want to do is to use yasnippet to expand a template into what you want
[18:12:28] <bpalmer> so, e.g., you type fn and then hit TAB, it expands into the boiler plate and lets you tab between the function name and the function body fields.
[18:15:10] <junction> bpalmer: thanks for having a look. You're right. It does seem like there is a minor mode is active. I'll need to investigate a bit further. I do after use yasnippet and its `fn` snippet but I'd also like to have this more generally
