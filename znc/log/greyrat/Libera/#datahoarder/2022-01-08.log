[20:38:00] <rawktucc> why not a direct ethernet cable between them
[20:38:13] <rawktucc> you probably just want an unmanaged switch
[20:38:20] <rawktucc> and you can set static IPs on each end I guess
[20:41:51] <skye0> And/or a router? I know too little about networking and related sysadmin stuff to just get two computers linked with just an Ethernet cable to talk to each other.

[20:45:49] <rawktucc> what are you using to connect from your one on powerline and one on wifi
[20:45:58] <rawktucc> which btw is a fine setup connectivity wise
[20:46:10] <skye0> It is but WiFi can get flaky
[20:46:18] <rawktucc> What device are you using for wifi
[20:46:27] <rawktucc> because the powerline is probably connected somehow to that device

[20:46:32] <skye0> laptop with an Ethernet port

[20:47:00] <skye0> So can get congested potentially at times
[20:47:15] <rawktucc> ah, ok. so you want a totally separate connectivity between your two personal devices
[20:47:25] <rawktucc> right?

[20:48:36] <rawktucc> well, couple options. One, buy a cheap used router somewhere, disable WIFI if you want AND/OR flash OpenWRT for more features, connect your computers there somehow, etc
[20:48:45] <rawktucc> alternative: connect the devices directly to each other
[20:48:50] <rawktucc> over ethernet
[20:48:59] <rawktucc> alternative: networking switch, again, ethernet
[20:50:51] <skye0> Looking for a router. A cheap one will do, will buy it later. Just been struggling to understand if my computers could talk to each other at all depending on whether I'm using a switch, hub, router or modem
[20:51:03] <rawktucc> avoid hubs
[20:51:22] <rawktucc> a modem is probably just a modem, if it's a cable or dial up modem. VDSL modems are normally modem+router but they're kinda crappy
[20:51:32] <rawktucc> and independent VDSL modems are expensive and hard to find
[20:51:37] <rawktucc> so yeah I would say a router
[20:51:59] <rawktucc> all you really need to do is assign PRIVATE IP addresses to each device, connect them together somehow (even directly) and in theory they can talk to each other
[20:52:19] <skye0> good to know. I've just been trying to figure out what our parents' ISP gave us for internet. I think it's a cable modem/router hybrid
[20:52:35] <rawktucc> can you take a picture or share a model number
[20:52:48] <rawktucc> it's probably a crappy all in one hybrid thing
[20:52:52] <rawktucc> which definitely will have crappy wifi
[20:54:17] <skye0> On it

[21:02:42] <skye0> Yup
[21:02:50] <rawktucc> so definitely an All in one crappy device :)
[21:03:38] <rawktucc> Personally I think LAN transfers shouldn't really be affected by wifi congestion, or rather device to device transfers because it all happens in the LAN. however over WIFI it would probably still be affected by overall signal
[21:04:00] <skye0> And I bet as a consumer networking device many cost cutting features exist. Ethernet is generally but not perfectly reliable for instance

[21:05:10] <rawktucc> when you're doing LAN to LAN transfers over ethernet, the router is most likely just doing direct transfers over the swithc, which is really nothing CPU wise
[21:05:15] <rawktucc> that's my loose understanding

[21:15:09] <skye0> My main issue with direct LAN transfers is the configuring, which is significantly more complex than having a router being able to act as a "translator" or "medium" between fundamentally different systems
