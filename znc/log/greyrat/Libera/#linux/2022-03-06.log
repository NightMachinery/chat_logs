[00:11:13] <Inline> from CA
[00:12:23] <Inline> CA is a preselected list of some root certs on each distro served to the user as a package and also as a dependency in case anyone installs (some) browsers and stuff like openssl/openssh

[13:00:29] <rahl> Is there are more appropriate channel than here to ask about hard dsik failure/ backup?
[13:00:29] <labrador> Whats the difference between cpu modes and rings?
[13:00:44] *** Quits: i0e (~is0ke3@user/is0ke3) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[13:00:44] <labrador> The x86-processors have four different modes divided into four different rings

[13:02:29] <rahl> I suspected a disk of failing; ran smartctl - short test passed (or appeared to). long seemed to but then I realised it was stopping/failing. As far as I could tell though, the drive was not failing
[13:02:41] <rahl> I may have been misunderstanding though
[13:02:46] <rudi_s> labrador: Rings are privilege levels (0 more privileged, 3 less) which control the what kind of instructions a program can execute. Modes are operating modes (e.g. long mode for 64-bit) which control what kind of programs you can run (16-bit, 32-bit, etc.).
[13:03:22] <rahl> Ran another check (can't remember the command I'm affraid) and it seemed only a couple of areas on the disk were having read failures

[13:03:35] <rudi_s> rahl: SMART can only give hints if a drive is failing. Basically you're in trouble if it says FAILED but you don't know if it works if it's says everything is fine.
[13:03:47] <rahl> ah. Thanks rudi_s

[13:04:40] <rahl> seeing a ton of read errors - more than expected

[19:40:11] <Schrostfutz> Hi, I administer a small (30 nodes) compute cluster. Currently those nodes are "anonymous" installations that are deployed via ansible. To reduce redundancy I consider switching to a "diskless", read-only installation. I'm wondering, how can customizations of the nodes be done in this case. For example, the interface names are consistent, so configration of these will have to differ per node.

[21:27:17] <__marco> Hello. Since many years I am using fluxbox, mainly because it is very light weight. At the time I had a laptop with only 1Gb of RAM. Since then I was too lazy to use something different but now I start to get annoyed by some bugs of fluxbox, mainly affecting firefox: the window is rendered without borders, it sticks on top of all other windows and I can not move it. Can you suggest a (tiling) window manger that simple as fluxbox but at the same time
[21:27:17] <__marco> maintained? Thanks

[21:38:51] <CaesarNaykid> good afternoon. I have a LAN PC running ubuntu and i'm trying to share media to my TV. I've tried the "Media Sharing" option in the GUI settings menu. I have tried installing minidlna and configuring that, I have now also installed PLEX and configured that and i'm trying to connect on the Plex app. No luck with any of them. Also a Samba share folder is shared on that Ubuntu box. I'm on another LAN PC now, and can
[21:38:51] <CaesarNaykid> connect to the SMB share and also I can connect to the ubuntu machine with ssh or NoMachine no problems so the machine isn't completely unviewable on the LAN. I'm just running out of ideas and guides to try. Any suggestions?
