[00:02:03] <kevin8t8> pmn: yes, you'll want $trash to be set or the deleted flags will be cleared out before syncing
[00:03:13] <kevin8t8> pmn: or sorry, I didn't read careflly
[00:03:31] <kevin8t8> pmn: thought you said $delete.
[00:04:32] <kevin8t8> pmn: looks like it won't interfere, but it will copy to the trash folder over and over I think.  so probably not a good idea to use the $trash folder with that option
[00:05:16] <pmn> kevin8t8: 1 deleted, thanks
[00:07:13] <pmn> kevin8t8: yes, so i have $delete set to false and $trash empty string/unset (i think that's default) and $mail_trash=true. seems to work
[00:08:28] <pmn> well, flag stays on the entry even after restarting mutt.... but `find . -iname '*,D'` still comes up empty... will regex for header
[00:08:29] <kevin8t8> pmn: hmmm... I would have thought you need $delete set 
[00:09:13] <pmn> kevin8t8: ,ST nice
[00:09:19] <pmn> so T for trash i guess
[00:09:37] <kevin8t8> pmn: yes
[00:09:38] <pmn> kevin8t8: if $delete is set the the file vanishes
[00:09:57] <kevin8t8> pmn: shouldn't with $maildir_trash also set
[00:10:00] <pmn> now lets see if mbsync picks it up
[00:10:10] <pmn> kevin8t8: oh!
[00:10:46] <pmn> kevin8t8: mbsync picked it up, thanks. i'm gonna try with delete set just out of curiosity
[00:12:31] <pmn> kevin8t8: yep, you're right. how come actually? $delete = true should purge right away no?
[00:13:02] <kevin8t8> pmn: looks like the sync code versus close-mailbox code is slightly different.  I'll look at it more closely later because I have to run soon
[00:13:34] <pmn> kevin8t8: sure, sorry to ping you like this. FYI: macro index,pager D "<delete-thread><sync-mailbox>"
[00:13:35] <kevin8t8> pmn: $maildir_trash overrides the "delete" behavior to instead just use the T flag.  but, at least with "sync" it still needs $delete to be set.
[00:14:31] <pmn> kevin8t8: i have that^ binding for D
[00:14:50] <pmn> which is what i use to mark an entry...
[00:16:18] <kevin8t8> pmn: glad you have it working.  I'll take a closer look at sync vs close later.  it's been a year or so since I dove into that code :)
[00:23:21] <pmn> kevin8t8: another FYI: neomutt actually behaves differently. (maildir_trash && delete) ? set_flag (ST) : noop;
