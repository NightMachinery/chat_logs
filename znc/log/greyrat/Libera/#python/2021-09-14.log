[00:30:54] <MaximB> I wonder,  I defined a function : def SetIntersection(x: set, y: set): .... but when I run it I gave it a list instead of a set: print(SetIntersection({ 1, 2, "d"},[2, "d", 4])) ,and it didn't gave me error... why? I mean I know this can work with lists, but I specifically asked for a set.
[00:32:04] <sco1> Python doesn't enforce type hints by default
[00:32:09] <bjs> MaximB: the `: set` part is just documentation,  it doesn't effect the program

[00:32:55] <bjs> MaximB: so if it gives you a list it's because the code of SetIntersection created and/or returned a list

[07:04:21] <FunkyBob> slee: that's not an HTML escape format, is it?
[07:04:41] <slee> it's what's returned in a json
[07:04:49] <slee> from an http request
[07:04:53] <BrenBarn> what do you mean unescape?
[07:05:04] <slee> convert it to it's normal character
[07:05:13] <slee> decode it?
[07:05:15] <catbeard> .decode('utf-8') ?
[07:05:17] <phy1729> If you're getting json in http response, have you looked at requests and .json() ?
[07:05:18] <FunkyBob> I am taking it to mean turn the literal string r'\u0022' to chr(22)
[07:05:35] <BrenBarn> if it's in JSON yeah you probably just want to parse the JSON
[07:05:42] *** Joins: portalrat (~portalrat@user/portalrat)
[07:05:52] <FunkyBob> slee: so, JSON over HTTP... no HTML involved.
[07:06:07] <slee> right, just json
[07:06:09] <FunkyBob> are you seeing that after you've parsed the JSON?
[07:06:20] <FunkyBob> or literally in the JSON encoded data?

[07:06:33] <slee> i'm not parsing it, just grabbing string between a start, stop point
[07:06:42] <slee> but i guess i'll just prse it
[07:06:46] <phy1729> You should really parse it properly
[07:06:55] <phy1729> json.loads or  https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#json-response-content
[07:07:05] <FunkyBob> the answer to "how do I unescape this JSON" is very likely "parse the json"
[07:07:18] <slee> thanks
[07:07:40] <FunkyBob> yeah, if  you're using requests, json support is built in
[07:07:47] <FunkyBob> otehrwise, stdlib's json works well

[08:07:40] <Widdershins> bennyblanco: python's sequences (bytes, str, list, tuple) can use the `*` operator to be repeated X many times. in this case you get 1 list that has 1 string that is the empty string put together 10 times, which happens to also be the empty string
[08:07:46] <bennyblanco> I see, so then bins = [ [""] * 10 ] which I can reference as bins[i]?

[16:18:12] <harpia> will compileall handle the imports, so when I run the resulting pyc file it already has all needed modules in it?
[16:18:19] <harpia> https://docs.python.org/3/library/compileall.html
[16:19:14] <bjs> harpia: well it just takes a directory tree and does the compilation step automatically on every file.  I'm not sure it's actually all that much of a useful thing to do

[16:24:58] <bjs> I'm not sure if pyz files are all that popular really
[16:25:22] <harpia> I tried to figure out how youtube-dl does it, they seem to be using 'zip'
[16:25:25] <bjs> (pyz files are essentially a zip file that contains all the code)
[16:25:35] <hodapp> never even heard of them, despite using Python since 2003
[16:25:55] <bjs> harpia: yeah, you zip everything up then have a script that asks python to run the zip file (or unpacks the zip file and runs the .py files directly)
[16:26:26] *** Joins: ferz (~ferz@93-39-143-181.ip76.fastwebnet.it)
[16:27:02] <bjs> but this is no different to just giving someone the .py files directly, in that they need to have Python (and the right version of Python) installed and in the right place
[16:27:04] <harpia> their makefile 'cat's the zip archive into an executable file, after pushing the shebang in as the first line

[16:58:13] <eightysix> Guys I am attempting to structure a library that I wrote in a way that makes it easy for a user to see full examples. I'm having trouble organizing the project in a way that both uses relative paths and allows for an /examples package at the top level next to /tests and /src. I would like to run, for instance /examples/example_01.py and have it use the code in /src like it was an outside package. Any ideas?
[16:59:01] <graingert[m]> eightysix: usually you'd have tox build and install your package
[16:59:18] <graingert[m]> then you can use tox devenv https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example/devenv.html
[16:59:24] <graingert[m]> and run the examples in that

[17:49:13] <rendar> 1 week!
[17:49:18] <Yhg1s> rendar: tasks groups do not have 'their own life'. You already have separate tasks. Why are you putting them in the same task group if you don't want them all to be cancelled when one raises an exception?
[17:49:18] <rendar> and i still can't fire commands
[17:49:35] <Yhg1s> rendar: perhaps you should start with something simpler, then.
[17:49:49] <rendar> something simpler than writing a simple command prompt?!
[17:49:57] <rendar> which is the 101 program you can even write?
[17:50:02] <Yhg1s> rendar: just because you can say it's simple doesn't make it simple.
[17:50:02] <supakeen> apparently it's hard, yes, you've been at it for a week
[17:50:14] <rendar> supakeen, it's not hard
[17:50:18] <rendar> are libraries that makes it hard
[17:50:26] <supakeen> then don't use those libraries that make it hard
[17:50:44] <ali1234> why would you use async for a command prompt?
[17:50:48] <supakeen> i really don't see the problem here, a command prompt is generally not hard but one can easily overcomplicate to the point of it being very hard
[17:50:50] <Yhg1s> rendar: a command prompt that deals with asynchronous tasks is *not* simple. I'm not sure why you think it's simple.
[17:50:53] <rendar> 1) with asyncio you can't manage stuff 2) ok let's install anyio 3) anyio doesn't let you have start_soon() for a SINGLE task
[17:50:56] <ali1234> that's pretty much the definition of a synchronous interface
[17:51:10] <supakeen> rendar: no because anyio/trio/etc follow structured concurrency which dislikes that idea

[17:52:29] <rendar> supakeen, man, it's ABSURD that a task which generates an exception cancels all other tasks

[17:52:57] <ali1234> that i agree with. exceptions and async does not go
[17:52:58] <supakeen> these libraries exist specifically for that idiom of asynchronous programming that doesn't let you loose tasks
[17:53:01] <Yhg1s> rendar: and no, it makes it much more *sensible*. *Create a new task group* if you need to not cancel a particular task.
[17:53:07] <rendar> Yhg1s, but my program is composed of multiple tasks, each task doing some different and non-related
[17:53:26] <Yhg1s> rendar: yes. And each of those independent, non-related tasks would be in separate task groups.

[17:59:05] <rendar> Yhg1s, ok, it's an hard problem, now: a possible solution can be creating a task group for every command i type?
[17:59:28] <Yhg1s> rendar: quite possibly, depending on what you actually need to do, sure.

[23:45:26] <ska> We want to unify some of our python repos: Common Makefile and some development import requirements. We still use setup.py, and pip. We can use subtree to have a common Makefile for tests/style-formats, but what about common imports?
[23:45:40] <joo> What is the best way to receive user input through some kind of form for the user so the user of the form generated by jupyter will not have to be entered as python code directly, but instead require a list of parameters entered nicely somehow ? like i got a report that requires a company number and some different numbers from the accounts of the company....
[23:46:31] <grym> ska: every time i've used subtree/submodule i've come to regret it
