[20:42:44] <sqz1> hi all, I find POSIX somewhat confusing. Is something POSIX as soon as it depends on libc? Is lua POSIX? And is IPC supported by lua?
[20:43:39] *** Joins: Moosadee (~Moosadee@136.32.155.193)
[20:45:27] <sqz1> iirc bash/sh/zsh e.g. is merely a layer with shell-grammar + REPL which delegates & pipes things using libc-calls and IPC..so in that sense I would think that libc is POSIX, and a shell implementation on top of it is just 'inheriting' POSIX
[20:47:12] <aquanight> sqz1: POSIX is a specific OS standard not particularly related to C or libc
[20:48:12] <aquanight> what you might be thinking of is the ANSI/ISO C standards. There's a bit of overlap between ANSI C and POSIX but POSIX also covers some aspects past C library functions such as command-line utilities.
[20:48:23] *** Quits: ratchet_freak (~ratchetfr@d8d8779d9.access.telenet.be) (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[20:49:38] <aquanight> as far as lua goes, core lua mainly relies on ANSI C. Anything beyond ANSI C is either indirectly (via os.execute) or imported by other modules and libraries via require()
[20:52:16] <aquanight> there are a few occasional non-ANSI things, like io.popen is technically in POSIX but not in ISO C
[20:53:07] <aquanight> for IPC, the simplest answer is "it depends". io.popen gives you something fairly close to what you can do with shells for exmaple.
[20:53:39] <aquanight> but if you need more than unidirecitonal pipes you'll have to look past core lua
[21:04:04] <sqz1> ah ok, thanks for clearing that up
[21:04:52] <sqz1> so like os.execute() is IPC-ish, but if you need more you can just extend lua using your own C-functions or a luaposix module e.g.
[21:05:56] *** Quits: Moosadee (~Moosadee@136.32.155.193) (Quit: Leaving)
[21:06:38] <sqz1> one more question: what is the lua terminology for function composition/currying using a semicolon..like `mystr:sub(0,4):gsub("foo","bar")` ?
[21:07:26] *** Joins: Moosadee (~Moosadee@136.32.155.193)
[21:11:16] <aquanight> that particular scenario isn't anything special other than the fact that strings allow you to use the string.* functions as methods
[21:11:32] <aquanight> and since :sub() returns a string, you can in turn call another string.* method off of it
[21:11:35] <furq> yeah those are just method calls

[21:13:24] <aquanight> something to note that this feature of strings too is nothing special. It's the fact that as a basic data type, all strings use the same metatable which by default has __index = string. You could replicate the effect exactly using: debug.setmetatable("", { __index = string })

[22:25:50] <sqz1> hm so this is called 'daisychaining': `bar = {} ; function bar.enter() return bar end ; function bar.leave() return bar end ; bar.enter().leave()`
[22:26:18] <sqz1> how to rewrite that using setmetatable, in order to allow `bar.enter():leave()` ?
[22:26:54] <glguy> sqz1: you'd have enter return the object as the result

[23:32:30] <kakolainen[m]> yes, it's even recursive so that metatables metatables work fine
[23:32:43] *** Joins: nbits (~nbits@179.110.23.146)
[23:32:56] *** Quits: nbits (~nbits@179.110.23.146) (Changing host)
[23:32:56] *** Joins: nbits (~nbits@user/nbits)
[23:33:04] <technomancy> lua, python, java, and ruby were all started within like 2 years of each other IIRC?
[23:34:24] <technomancy> it's weird that lua 5.1 and java 5 were contemporaries; lua 5.1 is still in widespread use but if you hear someone talking about still using java 5 nowadays you'd be horrified
[23:34:50] <kakolainen[m]> recursive metatbles can be used for example kind of like multiple inheritance chain in other language
[23:39:13] <sqz1> interesting, I should look up metatables
[23:44:57] <sqz1> hm this Roblox is indirectly marketing lua a lot
[23:45:24] <sqz1> I keep seeing its name popup in search results concerning learning lua 
[23:46:52] <sqz1> 43.2 million daily active users (Roblox) omg :)
[23:47:19] *** Quits: ano (~ano@user/ano) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:48:15] *** Joins: ano (~ano@user/ano)
[23:48:22] *** Quits: nbits (~nbits@user/nbits) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:50:46] <technomancy> 43.2 million users and they still couldn't afford TCO
[23:51:24] <tumn> I love your continued bashing of luau not having TCO
[23:51:40] <tumn> this is also the exact same hill I would die on
[23:52:03] <tumn> there seems to be a lot more wrong with luau too
[23:53:49] <tumn> I'm pretty sure one of my friends recently discovered the reason the lua vm shows up twice in the roblox binary is because the entire vm is const templated and gets instantiated 1 of 2 ways in an 'if' statement
[23:54:04] <furq> both of my nephews got robux for christmas
[23:54:08] <furq> really cemented my decision to never have kids
[23:54:25] <furq> that and my grotesque appearance
[23:54:31] <kakolainen[m]> the Lua wikipedia page seems pretty good, explains most things with simpler and better examples than what you find from luausers
[23:55:03] <tumn> kakolanien[m]: I strongly recommend the official lua manual, it's extremely thorough and easy to follow
[23:55:40] <tumn> usually manuals aren't as clear and well-formatted as the lua manual is
[23:56:59] <kakolainen[m]> what is the official Lua manual? the documentation page?
[23:57:48] <kakolainen[m]> I mean the reference page on Lua website
[23:58:16] <tumn> yea it's titled "lua reference manual"
