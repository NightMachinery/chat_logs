[00:00:44] <CoderCop> Close. You want: `kill -USR1 4425` 61374 is the PID of the "grep" command you are running at that moment. 4425 is the pid of the most specific fsck command running. (fsck likely spawned fsck.ext4 based on the fs type)

[00:03:25] <CoderCop> Hmm... may have to use sudo since you started fsck with sudo. If that doesn't work, try 4423 or 4424.
[00:03:32] <jesseTree>  CoperCop, I agree with you. No internet on the machine with fsck atm

[01:53:54] <akoana> what kill command did you enter?
[01:54:04] <jesseTree> looking for it
[01:54:52] <orzel> Hi there. I'm a rather senior linux "general" sysadmin, including software raid. But i dont much about megaraid/hardware raid. I have a computer with such a pci card, connected to lot of disks, which are all seen by the megaraid bios at boot. They aren't part of any raid / "virtual disk", just marked as "good". But i can't see them once linux is booted. Do you what i've missed ?
[01:55:09] <akoana> kill (the name is a bit misleading) doesn't always kill a process, it can be used to send a signal to a process, for example to report its progress...
[01:55:13] <orzel> I dont want to use raid on those, just see them as usual, having the controler only act as a sata/sas controler. not raid.
[01:55:42] <jesseTree> akoana, "sudo kill -USR1 4425"
[01:56:19] <jesseTree> akoana, Merci, that's dope as fuck if I don't say.  Target in on whatever the Use Case requires

[01:57:43] <akoana> jesseTree: anyway I'd just let fsck do its work and wait until it finishes...
[01:58:50] <akoana> jesseTree: did you see some progress information when doing   sudo kill -USR1 4425  ?
[01:58:56] <jesseTree> akoana, that's what I was trying to display.  Miss fire first shot eh? So there is no way to see how long this process will take? My calculations tell me could be 7.5 days.

The system is a cluster where I can get dedicated nodes, but asking for a setuid binary to do this drop_caches thing (as is recommended online) is out of the question. Is there any other way to flush out the fs cache without root? It can be limited to my user's files
[05:19:05] <akoana> jesseTree: maybe you could stop fsck, reverse the lv resize (old size), and then repeat the shrinking (but this time with shrinking the filesystem too), then fsck and restore if necessary.

[10:45:48] <analyze_this> hi there. Learning data analysis and in that time looking to build myself a software stack in which i'll be most comfortable. Many data scientists swear by linux (not sure about analysts, though), so i'm looking into it. I used windows professionally all the time, and i used ubuntu and opensuse for my home computer for a year or so in 2015-ish.
[10:45:49] <analyze_this> What i like about windows is mostly software availability (especially visualization software), and linux security and how fast it is. My question is: I plan to learn data wrangling, vizualization and then R and python. Is there anything i can't do on windows that i can on linux in that regard. Does a choice of OS even matter in this context?
[10:45:49] <analyze_this> thanks!
[10:46:54] <ikonia> Sauvin: no disagrement on php - I'm not writing anything, I'm just looking at the pros and cons of each as I've typically in the past kept away from nginx+php and defaulted to apache just out of habbit with the odd exception
[10:46:54] <deniska> analyze_this: python is surely available for linux, R probably is too
[10:47:02] <ikonia> just curious to personal views to backup the reading I'm doing

[13:45:11] <phogg> primary, secondary, and clipboard. The clipboard is the clipboard, but as a bonus there is also the selection buffer (primary). If you just pretend the selection buffer doesn't exist everything works like MacOS and Windows.

[13:49:12] <phogg> nomagno: basically, the issue you have is xclip *by default* will assume you are making a selection, not copying to/from the clipboard. This is opposite of what you expected.
[13:50:35] <nomagno> But... You have xclip and xsel, and they both do the same thing by default!? Naming idiosyncrasiesTM
[13:50:56] <phogg> nomagno: once you're used to thinking about the selected/copied distinction it really stops being hard to track. The real issue comes when apps disagree about when to update or clear the selection buffer.

[14:12:35] <Far> hexnewbie: alright.
[14:12:54] <hexnewbie> Far: Partitions still visible in lsblk simply indicates that the kernel didn't re-read the partition table, that could be because it wasn't notified (you can force an explicit notification with ‘partprobe /dev/sdx’ from the 'parted' package), or because one of the partitions is in use and cannot be inactivated

[17:00:10] <hodapp> the Compaq Deskpro I had many years ago required a certain hard drive partition to even enter some counterpart of BIOS setup
[17:00:14] <kek_> hi, so I'm on a cluster and I submit/get a job for N cores on a cou with N+ cores. I want to see the load of the cores I was assigned to. Any idea how I can do that? If I use top, I see all cores on the node/cpu.
[17:00:23] <hodapp> since I got it secondhand and added my own drive, it had no such partition...
[17:00:26] <Psi-Jack> The only "recovery partition" I know about would be for laptops with a Windows install, and the "recovery partition" being there. Rip that shit out, burn a restore disc/USB, and keep THAT safe.
[17:00:27] <Khaytsus> Long ago I had a PC at work that swapped HD and the BIOS wouldn't work anymore.  Swapped HD back in, worked again.  Like it loaded data off the HD.  Scary.
[17:00:49] <zfigz> psi-jack: it's a partition that has the boot iso on it.
[17:00:58] <Khaytsus> Yeah, what hodapp said..  BIOS depended on it.  I hope that's not really a thing anymore though.
[17:01:02] <Psi-Jack> zfigz: "boot iso" for what?
[17:01:12] <zfigz> pop
[17:01:15] <Psi-Jack> Khaytsus: It's not been "a thing" for BIOS.. Ever.
[17:01:15] <zfigz> :-P
[17:01:16] <Khaytsus> ew
[17:01:23] <Psi-Jack> zfigz: Pop! OS doesn't make said partition.
[17:01:26] <Khaytsus> Psi-Jack: Sure, it was, but okay...
[17:01:28] <zfigz> doing a timeshift restore now, hopefully that gets me up to date a bit more
[17:01:53] <zfigz> psi-jack: it's just the 4gb partition
[17:01:57] <Khaytsus> BIOS setup would not work without it.  I don't recall offhand if the machine aws otherwise okay, I guess it was.

[17:50:04] <CoolerX> even with lpr
[17:50:14] <xuochi> Tyaku: yeah. you use the older toolchain to compile a newer one. the only thing is, you might want to compile static with your code. you will be linking a newer libc that won't be present on all of the embedded devices
[17:50:15] <Psi-Jack> lpr is literally part of CUPS.

[18:15:26] <John_Ivan> djph, unsure.

[19:43:43] <Guest18> @aban Thank you, it works <3
[19:43:43] <SnoopJ> bancroft, the tl;dr as I understand it is that each process has a virtual address space, and the VMM maps shared libraries into the process space when you dynamically load them (which is what will happen when you import an extensino module in Python). Not all of that memory will be resident, but smaps will tell you the vitals (i.e. how much is currently resident etc.)

[20:48:00] <tdoirc> so... I have a netns with bond0.555 (192.168.40.1) inside it, veth0 pair with outside the netns being 172.25.36.1 inside the netns being 172.25.36.2, I have a route defined as `192.168.40.0/24 via 172.25.36.2 dev veth0`, and iptables forwarding allowed. I can ping 192.168.40.1 from outside the netns, but I can't reach anything connected to bond0.555. any idea what I'm overlooking?

[20:49:11] <Psi-Jack> zfigz: That's generated, every backup run. The pre-backup script is setup to be modular, but per-distro specifics are captured, like what packages are installed, so they can be easily simply re-installed. snaps, flatpaks, repos, etc.. Are all restored. There's things for database backups, gitea backup, ldap backup, etc..
[20:49:44] <zfigz> ah yah, i've looked at the sql db piece for that
[20:50:47] <TJ-> tdoirc: is there a reverse route inside the netns, to reply back to the host network ?
[20:50:57] <Psi-Jack> I used to write my own wrapper for borgbackup, now I just use borgmatic, because they did it right and did it well.
[20:51:14] <zfigz> "simply reinstall the OS" ?
