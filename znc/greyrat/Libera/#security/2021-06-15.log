[02:38:08] <soulisson> Sorry to bother you. I'm studying a little bit attacks on MS SQL Server. I'm currently studying the linked servers feature and I was wondering if there was a way to enable "xp_cmdshell" stored procedure without using 'EXEC AT' queries?

[02:53:16] <soulisson> lacroix, no, sorry my english is not great. I will try to explain my best. On MS SQL Server, by default the stored procedure "xp_cmdshell", if you want to enable it on another MS SQL instance, you have to use the stored procedure sp_configure like sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1
[02:53:56] *** Joins: wuzamarine (~kvirc@023-084-070-238.res.spectrum.com)
[02:54:34] <soulisson> The only way I found to do that on another ms sql instance is something like that EXEC('sp_configure ''xp_cmdshell'', 1; RECONFIGURE') AT [TARGET_INSTANCE]. I was wondering if there was another way to do this

[03:13:24] <soulisson> lacroix, no, it's not about Bling SQL Injection, it's about exploiting ms sql server
[03:13:54] <lacroix> yes through Blind SQLi.
[03:14:59] <lacroix> well, firstly you would obviously need to make sure that xp_cmdshell is running

[03:17:01] <lacroix> you would use ping for example for that, if you send for example 7 packets with ping, you would expect the script to hang for the same amount of seconds
[03:17:46] <lacroix> exec xp_cmdshell 'ping -n 7 xxxx'
[03:19:13] <spb> soulisson: depending what version of sql server it is, and how it's configured, you might also be able to use EXECUTE [LinkedServer].[Database].[dbo].sp_configure
[03:19:51] <lacroix> by doing this you're pushing the stored procedure to ping X 7 times causing the script to wait for 7 seconds
[03:20:35] <lacroix> if it's yes, then you're pretty much done, if not, you'll need to modify your injection string
[03:21:16] <lacroix> you will need to use is_srvolmember
[03:21:55] *** Quits: g00fy (~g00fy@user/g00fy) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[03:22:06] <lacroix> use that to query the database to see if you have access or not. If you have, the stored procedure will return 1, if not, 0
[03:23:25] <lacroix> you can use > 0 waitfor delay '0:0:7'
[03:23:41] <lacroix> if it hangs for the 7 intended seconds, then you're done
[03:24:03] <lacroix> then you re-enable xp_cmdshell as you've done up
[03:24:22] <lacroix> spoke half words... he will get it if it's a real course
[03:25:07] <soulisson> I'm aware of how to enable, disable and identify if 'xp_cmdshell' is enabled. This is not the issue
[03:25:27] <soulisson> The issued is with linked servers
[03:26:08] <lacroix> the above was to check if you it was enabled or not and/or if you have access or not

[03:42:05] <soulisson> lacroix, yes, if RPCOUT is not enabled that kind of query won't work. I wasn't able to make sp_configure work with OpenQuery. The reason is that sp_configgure 'x',1 doesn't provide a result set

[03:49:14] <lacroix> the dir command will be executed on the OS.

[03:50:48] <soulisson> lacroix, the issue is not with xp_cmdshell but with sp_configure and RECONFIGURE. RECONFIGURE doesn't work with SELECT, etc statements

[04:25:56] <soulisson> I working on a plugin for exchange. I already implemented some attacks to retrieve the mailbox of the victim and as well user account creation and escalation.
[04:25:57] <elkclone> like for powershell exploitation? ah I've heard of it.

[04:26:35] <elkclone> nice work.
[04:27:10] <elkclone> so you have ntlmrelayx set auto deliver a payload when there is a connection.
[04:28:48] *** Quits: x0n^ (~x0n@user/x0n/x-8833323) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[04:28:58] <soulisson> Yes, absolutely. These are attacks that involve ntlm relaying. Now I would like to be able to push malicious rules in the mailbox of the user, however the kind of rules I want to push can't be used with Exchange Services (The SOAP web service) however it works with MAPI. I would like some library to just  do that
[04:30:58] <soulisson> I know nothing about MAPI. I would have to dive in the MS documentation and create the objects, do the serialization, etc by myself. It's a lot of work and I don't want to spend too much time on this.

[04:33:57] <elkclone> luckily ntlmrelayx is in python I think so that's a win.

[04:36:32] <soulisson> The SensePost team already did a great job for that with the tool ruler. Unfortunately the tool is written in GOLang (not that I have anything against GoLang). I could take parts of it, make an executable and call it from the plugin but honestly, this is too hacky and on the other had I don't want to spend that much time on something that I'm not getting anything from it. I hope I'm making sense :)

[21:58:40] <Clearity> has anyone tried to take advantage of the situation and rob walletbot yet?
[21:58:59] <Clearity> i feel like this whole freenode takeover has promising possibilities for robbing walletbot
[21:59:08] <Clearity> i'd do it myself but i'm busy with other projects at the moment
