[00:00:08] <masterboy9> i recognize the first string is base64 but when i decode it i get gibberish
[00:00:16] <masterboy9> thats as far as i can go im super inexperienced
[00:00:37] <wasamasa> use a pastebin to properly preserve the message
[00:00:50] <wasamasa> who knows whether there's anything hidden inside that doesn't make it via IRC
[00:01:09] <wasamasa> besides, there's plenty of channels kicking you for posting anything longer than two lines
[00:01:18] <masterboy9> okay appreciate it

[00:02:22] <wasamasa> honestly, this is giving me ARG vibes
[00:02:27] <wasamasa> which means it's a massive waste of time

[00:07:50] <masterboy9> got nothing thats why im here lol
[00:09:20] <Alipha> My initial thought is that you're supposed to change the case of the letters in the base64 according to the casing in "I wAnT to PLAy a GaME WiTH YoU" But that's just a shot on the dark
[00:09:48] <wasamasa> the first obvious thing here is that the strings after encoding are 32 and 96 bytes
[00:09:53] <wasamasa> *decoding
[00:10:12] <wasamasa> if I look at the frequencies, they bytes are very uniformly distributed
[00:10:17] <Alipha> wasamasa: so it's potentially a key and a ciphertext?
[00:10:34] * wasamasa does the eyebrow wiggle
[00:11:17] <wasamasa> https://giphy.com/gifs/eyebrow-raise-yep-close-up-AZ1PPDF8uO9MI
[00:13:10] <masterboy9> okay gonna try changing the casing
[00:14:02] <masterboy9> wait no that cant be it, some letters are both caps and non caps

[03:34:26] <Soni> the plan is to later make another post, with the same title, but it's about implementing OTR over IRC properly
[03:36:20] <rk4> hmm link doesn't render with javascript off
[03:36:36] <rk4> turned on js and now it errored
[03:36:46] <rk4> fuck i hate twitter.
[03:38:59] <rk4> what does "OTR over IRC properly" mean, are the current OTR implementations improper?
[03:39:55] <Soni> rk4: current OTR implementations will even leak /me's sometimes
[03:40:35] <Soni> also they often don't work, like, at all, with DCC chat
[03:41:03] <rk4> i see
[03:41:27] <Soni> basically, OTR on IRC is (currently) a joke
[03:42:01] <rk4> yeah...i tried the otr plugin in irssi before it was mainlined, but when it had memory errors i noped out
[03:42:16] <Soni> anyway, the tweet is a link to https://soniex2.autistic.space/posts/2021/12/10-satirechain.xhtml
[03:42:16] <rk4> encryption gets negated by RCEs ya know

[04:36:58] <Alipha> jbis: to avoid accidently reusing an IV in one direction vs the other direction. If you have separate keys, it doesn't matter if you use the same IV with one key vs a different key
[04:37:40] <Alipha> jbis: yes, you can derive multiple keys from a single key. They're called KDF (key derivation functions)
[04:38:01] <jbis> Yep
[04:38:05] <jbis> That's what I thought
[04:38:05] <jbis> thanks

[23:17:19] <jim87> Hello! I want to use the Fernet cryptography to encrypt and decrypt data between two hosts. I've noticed that since Python version 3.0 it supports encrypt_at_time (and decrypt_at_time). I was wondering though about hosts sync and how to determine the time passed to the receiver, in order to correctly decrypt the message. Do you have any experience with this?

[23:19:58] <Wulf> jim87: Hello. You need to make sure that the time is correct on all your systems
[23:20:22] <TimMc> It looks like those functions are only intended to be used in tests.
[23:20:53] <TimMc> Otherwise, you should be using NTP or similar so that your hosts just always agree on what time it is. :-)
[23:21:28] <jim87> TimMc: should I thus use Fernet encrypt and decrypt? I want to use a pre-shared key and be cryptographycally secure avoiding a MITM attack
[23:21:38] <Wulf> this whole Fernet thing is strange anyway. What's it good for?
[23:22:26] <wasamasa> drinking
[23:22:41] <TimMc> Well, I don't have any particular experience with Fernet, despite having seen it used at work. I'm just going off of what it says at https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/#cryptography.fernet.Fernet.encrypt_at_time
[23:23:41] <TimMc> So while I can say that you shouldn't use encrypt_at_time in your normal code, I can't recommend the encrypt function because I don't know what your use-case is or what Fernet's guarantees are for that function.

[23:30:10] <TimMc> Can't really say unless you explain what you're trying to do.
[23:30:34] <TimMc> Fernet appears to be fit for some purpose, just based on reputation, but I can't say whether it's fit for *your* purpose.

[23:31:15] <jim87> TimMC: I want to use a PSK to communicate between a VPN central peer and a peer which wants to join the network
[23:31:28] <jim87> the idea is to use the PSK to avoid unwanted people join the VPN
[23:31:30] *** Joins: infurion (~enlight@157.35.0.127)
[23:32:54] <Wulf> jim87: let's say you're using wireguard. You need to exchange public keys and some other parameters like ip addresses. That's all public. You can sign the data using a pre-shared key and HMAC or do it manually, e.g. phone call to network admin.
[23:33:55] <Wulf> Or you could set up a simple HTTPs service. Service authenticates itself using the web pki (letsencrypt or similar) and you authenticate yourself with a key that was handed to you in person.
[23:35:36] <jim87> Wulf: yeah, I'm developing a wireguard setup tool to manage IP addresses assignment and others. The need of a PSK is to allow only authorized people join the net. If someone knows the PSK, it is allowed to ask the server to add its peer configuration to the list
