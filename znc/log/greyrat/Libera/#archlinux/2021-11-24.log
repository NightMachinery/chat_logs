[01:13:06] <MacGyver> In normal use you won't notice a difference between any of the available filesystems.
[01:13:11] <Repentinus> ZFS on Arch is somewhat painful, so unless you need one of the features not available with any other file system, use something else.
[01:13:33] <Gagis> figuring out what you need and whats just vapor and hype is pretty much impossible. that cop out answer always makes me a little mad
[01:13:49] <MacGyver> btrfs is hardly vapor or hype anymore.
[01:13:58] <MacGyver> Your sane choices are ext4 and btrfs.
[01:14:04] <MacGyver> And neither will destroy your drive.

[01:25:46] <Repentinus> moonshine, btrfs supports scrubbing.
[01:25:47] <moonshine> someone might go a long time before btrfs gives any trouble, but if it does, repair isn't really a strength of btrfs at all.
[01:25:53] <moonshine> zfs on the other hand, does this constantly.
[01:26:23] <Repentinus> ZFS constantly scrubs if you set up a regular scrub using systemd/cron.
[01:26:28] <Repentinus> You can do the same with btrfs.
[01:27:01] <moonshine> ok i've said enough, you're taking a btrfs advocacy position and i'm trying to be in the middle on this
[01:27:40] <remanifest> Anyone else having issues launching Steam? I'm running kernel 5.15.4. I know it was working on 5.15.2 without issue. When I launch steam, I get /usr/lib/steam/steam: line 216: /home/remanifest/.local/share/Steam/steam.sh: Success - ps aux shows no running processes for Steam.
[01:28:17] <Repentinus> No, I am not. I have two ZFS pools in my home server and I run ext4 on my laptop (the installation dates from before btrfs was stable).

[01:29:14] <moonshine> i think people are confused by what facts mean
[01:29:37] <Repentinus> Aka I do not use btrfs, but that does not prevent me from recognizing it as the most appropriate advanced file system for general use right now.
[01:29:43] <moonshine> i'm not going to paste the history of zfs in here, you can go look for yourself.

[01:31:32] <moonshine> that i agree.
[01:32:08] <moonshine> zfs is also less simple.

If Oracle for some unfathomable reason relicensed the last free Solaris ZFS, I am sure that most OpenZFS contributors would be happy to relicense their contributions to a GPLv2-compatible licence, but if the premise is never gonna happen, there is little point in debating the details.

[05:54:31] <mpan> If that occurs again, I would poke around power management. As to me it seems as if the USB ports got powered down. Not devices, but the ports themselves, which would prevent them from even notifying the kernel about a new device being hot-plugged.

[06:21:59] <Namarrgon> what about $PATH?

[09:30:38] <Hydragyrum> "is the config file saying what I want" and "do the things that follow from the config file work right" aren't quite the same
[09:31:21] <brocellous> my point is the server used for name resolution by ping isn't necessarily the same as the one in /etc/resolv.conf, so it doesn't answer the question.

[15:04:05] <luigibu> yes.. i build this pc 1 year ago
[15:04:11] <grawity> yeah; some older systems from 8+ years ago *did* have UEFI but it was very dependent on luck
[15:04:15] <Gagis> on computers that did not come with a CRT monitor, the answer is usually UEFI

[15:05:40] <grawity> so, on all modern systems, use UEFI (unless you already have Windows installed in BIOS layout ... but even then, better to convert Windows to UEFI instead.)
[15:06:02] <luigibu> and what is the size recomendation for swap? i got an small sdd drive (120gb)
[15:06:10] <grawity> how much RAM do you have?
[15:06:11] *** Joins: earnestly (~earnest@user/earnestly)

[15:06:35] <grawity> ... 64 GB of RAM and only an 120 GB SSD?
[15:07:03] <grawity> anyway, I'd create a 1-2 GB swap partition, but not more than that
[15:07:07] <luigibu> is just to test the instalation.. if i success.. i will install it over another 1T drive
[15:07:28] <Gagis> I think I have half of my total ram as swap but that feels way more than necessary with modern computers with tons of ram. 1-2 GB sounds a lot more sane than this
[15:07:59] <Gagis> laptop with the same amount of ram has like 1gb of swap
[15:08:04] <luigibu> sweet! thanks! I problably.. will have more question.. hope you dont mind.. 
[15:08:16] <greenhamster> I don't have swap at all with 64GB of RAM. If I ever run out of RAM I'll look into swap files.

[16:47:39] *** Joins: bryan (~bryan@user/bryan)
[16:47:59] <luigibu> nop.. but.. as i dont have connection, i cant install any right?
[16:48:09] <KillerWasp_> i already make 'pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring' , but still have problem with gpg signatures

[16:48:34] <toinux> luigibu can you reboot on an archiso and pacstrap it from there ?
[16:48:44] <KillerWasp_> also, i can only work with 1 pendrive with a old ISO, and already download the last ISO

[16:49:28] <luigibu> so.. i should boot again with the usb?
[16:49:39] <Scimmia> KillerWasp_: how old are we talking about?
[16:49:54] <KillerWasp_> i guess that i only need copy files and update the gpg keys for the keyring of the old ISO, how to work with it? which's the files that i must copy?
[16:49:56] <Namarrgon> luigibu: if this is a static connection then systemd-networkd should be more than adequate for the job
[16:50:16] <KillerWasp_> Scimmia: like 3 or 4 mounth maybe, or more, i unknown.
[16:50:20] <luigibu> yes.. ethernet cable with dhcp
[16:50:27] <Namarrgon> 'static' as in wired connection that's not going to change much
[16:50:49] <Scimmia> KillerWasp_: that shouldn't be an issue. What errors are you seeing, exactly?
[16:51:13] <KillerWasp_> Scimmia: wrong with signatures, and i can't install the packages with pacstrap
[16:51:34] <Scimmia> "exactly"
[16:51:51] <KillerWasp_> yes, it's exactly, that's begin of all the problems

[17:10:02] <Arsimael> Hi. 
[17:11:25] <Arsimael> I just have a quick question: I am reinstalling arch and editing the mkinitcpio.conf file. I usually enter "ext4" under the Modules=() line, and I am still wondering why? Isn'T ext4 directly supported by the kernel? what if I want to use a different FS like xfs?
[17:11:54] <jkc> Never needed to add that to modules, ever. ext4, xfs work out of the box.
[17:12:15] <jkc> Someone else here may be able to give examples of when that's needed, but I've never had to.
[17:12:54] <Arsimael> Thats what I am assuming. It's just some install tutorials (which i still use as a little help not to forget a step) still suggest it. 
[17:13:07] <jkc> And that's why random tutorials suck.
[17:13:19] <rcf> Arsimael: mkinitcpio is smart enough to figure out your root filesystem type and include the appropriate modules automatically. 
[17:13:19] <Arsimael> arch tutorials
[17:13:19] <Namarrgon> the 'filesystem' hook already adds the right modules
[17:13:21] <jkc> And rather than using some shitty tutorial, use the wiki. :)
[17:13:37] <Arsimael> that is from the Wiki
[17:13:40] <rcf> Arsimael: though keep in mind that no filesystem types are supported by the kernel alone, they're all modules.

[21:32:24] <Luke> chmod will always interpret a number in octal by design, and adding leading zeroes won't make that behaviour more explicit
[21:32:34] <tirnanog> only it does, as was just demonstrated.
[21:32:43] <tirnanog> it's a bad interface.

[21:33:22] <Luke> but when referring to it otherwise it's probably better to be clear in case you use that as a decimal value in C-like languages
[21:33:26] <tirnanog> ayekat: 2755 should be fine as four octal digits as is much as the utility is prepared to interpret anyway.
[21:33:36] <ayekat> it looks like chmod accepts both a 3-digit and 4-digit octal (where it treats a 3-digit octal number as "don't change any of S_IS{UID,GID,VTX}")
[21:33:41] <tirnanog> ayekat: it's when specifying fewer that it's a problem.
[21:33:46] <tirnanog> Luke: fair enough.

[21:34:50] <ayekat> yeah, it just works in the shell when invoking chmod like that - in other cases (e.g. Ansible here), it may lead to some nasty surprises to forget the leading 0 (or not passing "755" as a string in YAML - IMHO equally weird)
[21:34:55] <Luke> for sure - in Ansible (as I'm currently writing) you have to specify a leading zero for an octal identifier (so 02755) or quote it ("2755") if you're specifying  numeric modes

[21:38:20] *** Joins: progandy (~progandy@user/progandy)
[21:38:51] <tirnanog> ayekat: it gets worse. the behaviour of the octal mode operand is undefined by posix in the matter of whether chmod(1) honours requests to set or clear the setuid/setgid bits for all but regular files. I suppose we should be thankful it works at all.

[21:43:34] <ayekat> Luke: so if C was super-pedantic about it, it wouldn't accept `0` because it's just the prefix for "octal", but no value behind it (e.g. it doesn't accept `int x = 0x;`)...?
[21:43:48] <susi> why's xorg using -auth /tmp/serverauth.XXX file when started with `startx`, and not ~/.Xauthority? and why that /tmp/serverauth.XXX has two entries, only one number differs in xxd (".....hostname..0.. vs hostname..1..") between those two cookies
