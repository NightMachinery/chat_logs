[08:10:29] <peterhil> Speaking of France, I was a REALLY good documentary about French national forestry agents. The situation was as bad as in Finland, and there had been a wave of suicides because the forestry service workers did not agree with the politics that came after privatization of the national forestry service.
[08:11:01] <peterhil> The Finnish orestry service was privatized almost ten years ago IIRC.
[08:11:30] <peterhil> I saw a really good documentary...
[08:12:42] <bpalmer> I was just reading a thing talking about how part of what keeps Finnish forestry from being too uniform is how private it is (20% of the population belongs to a family that owns some forest)

[21:12:46] <mwette> Hi All.  I want to make changelog style comments in my git commits.  I have '("COMMIT_EDITMSG" . log-edit-mode) in my auto-mode-alist.  So "git commit" opens the COMMIT_EDITMSG in emacs w/ Log-Edit mode, but I don't know how to add an entry.  `C-x 4 a' is not doing what I want.  Any ideas?
[21:13:16] <twb> This is the current C++ standard (draft): https://github.com/cplusplus/draft

[21:14:56] <twb> that's... wrong for git
[21:15:13] <MiraCat> That's awesome that scheme is very minimalist, great for doing small tasks or some light scripting, but I think I'll stick with common lisp because it has built in OOP concepts among other many different things.

[21:19:01] <MiraCat> I haven't used racket much honestly, but I'll think to myself either using common lisp or racket if you insist I be using racket instead of say guile or gambit scheme.
[21:19:13] <edgar-rft> MiraCat: The main problem with Scheme is that only the minimum core langauge is specified, what has to the consequence that for example Guile code will probably not run on any other Scheme implemtation without source code modifications. Common Lisp doesn't have that problem.
