[20:08:06] <brandflake11> Hey all, which data structure takes up more memory: Vectors or hash tables?
[20:08:59] <thrig> hash tables are often built using vectors under the hood
[20:09:33] <brandflake11> The reason I ask, is because I am making a stopwatch in lisp. Right now, I'm using a hashtable to register the amount of "clocks" per second. This is being stored in a hash table at the moment.
[20:09:52] <brandflake11> thrig: Does that mean it won't make a huge difference?
[20:10:02] <brandflake11> To choose between vector or hash table?
[20:10:19] <beach> brandflake11: The two do not support the same operations.
[20:10:29] <beach> I don't see how you can just replace one with the other.
[20:10:40] <thrig> vectors suck if you need to find a particular key. hash tables suck if you need to iterate
[20:11:19] <brandflake11> The thing that I am more concerned about is the memory usage, since it is inputting values every second
[20:11:32] <beach> brandflake11: From what you said, the "amount" of clocks per second is a single value, so no need for a data structure at all.
[20:12:09] <beach> brandflake11: If you can be a bit more specific about the kind of data you store, maybe we can give better advice. 
[20:12:56] <brandflake11> beach: Sorry, I am just storing an integer every second. I'm using a hash table so that I can see how many clocks were input at a certain second.
[20:13:22] <beach> So what are the keys in your hash table?
[20:13:34] <brandflake11> beach: The keys are the seconds, which are just another integer
[20:13:54] <beach> And they are consecutive and dense, like 0, 1, 2...?
[20:13:59] <brandflake11> beach: Yes
[20:14:11] <beach> Then there is totally no point in using a hash table. 
[20:14:32] <brandflake11> beach: Would a list be better to use then?
[20:14:37] <beach> A vector can give you direct access to the value your are looking for.
[20:15:16] <beach> A hash table would have to compute a hash function, do a modulo operation, and a search of a bucket or a table.
[20:16:02] <brandflake11> beach: In this case, does that mean vectors would be more efficient?
[20:16:03] <beach> And the hash table would take up more memory.
[20:16:18] <beach> Er, yes, that's what it means.
[20:16:47] <beach> Any time you have a domain with dense consecutive integers, the answer is a vector.  I can't think of any exceptions to that .
[20:17:07] <brandflake11> beach: Thanks! As a general rule, does that mean hash tables should only be used with symbols as the key?
[20:17:17] <beach> No.
[20:17:34] <beach> If the domain is not dense, but consists of integers, then a vector is crap.
[20:17:50] <beach> Consider if your keys are 0, 2342342342, 3923482342938492384, 22, 2222222
[20:18:18] <beach> You would then store a 3923482342938492385 element vector with 5 valid elements in it.
[20:18:24] <beach> That's when you use a hash table.
[20:18:27] <brandflake11> beach: That makes sense

[20:20:17] <brandflake11> beach: Thank you for your help with this question!
[20:20:30] <brandflake11> thrig: Thank you for your advice too!
[20:20:31] <beach> Occasionally, your keys are from a totally ordered domain, like the integers, and you care about the order, say because you want to look at some interval.  Then hash tables can't be used, and you would use a tree structure if the domain is not dense.
[20:21:20] <brandflake11> beach: Hmm, I don't know what a tree is. This is something I need to look up
[20:21:33] <thrig> red black tree
[20:21:37] <beach> brandflake11: I strongly advise you to look into an intro text on "algorithms and data structures".  You can't really do any programming without such knowlege.
