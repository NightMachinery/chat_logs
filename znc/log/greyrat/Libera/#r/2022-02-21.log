[11:27:28] <twrk> =\
[11:48:04] <rickyrick> :^)
[11:51:20] <twrk> how to center a div in R
[11:53:17] <rickyrick> lmao
[11:53:36] <rickyrick> I wonder if anyone's run R as a cgi backend
[11:53:50] <twrk> that sounds trivial
[11:54:02] <twrk> but also, shiny?
[11:54:26] <twrk> err, why do that when you've got shiny.... then again, server/security concerns? and down that rabbit hole...
[11:55:00] <rickyrick> Does shiny actually serve the pages using R or does it have an intermediate that just fetches results from R
[11:55:30] <rickyrick> https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FastRWeb/FastRWeb.pdf
[11:55:32] <rickyrick> well okay.r
[11:55:35] <twrk> mmm yeah, like, what kind of webserver does shiny spin up? iuno haven't looked into it that far
[11:56:15] <rickyrick> I think all the special sauce in Shiny is that Shiny itself IS the backend
[11:56:46] <twrk> but why would it reinvent the web wheel
[11:57:01] <rickyrick> idk
[11:57:06] <rickyrick> never seriously used shiny :^)
[11:57:31] <twrk> actually, afamvlkg (as far as my very limited knowledge goes), I thought it was shiny code -> javascript basically
[11:57:40] <rickyrick> mmm javakanker

[12:27:49] <confuzeus> quick simulation problem in R: 15 different colours of marbles (k1,k2,...,k15) into a bag; N = sum(k1,....,k15); pull out n at random; 1<=n<=N;what is the probability that you will have 6 or more different colours; test with k's =  c(2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1); n=6, n=7, n=8. share the probability only and not your code. my answers are  0.50385, 0.83642,0.96119
[12:31:28] <confuzeus> also, without replacement.
