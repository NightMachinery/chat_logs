[00:02:41] <moose> There should be a way to bring formal action against a public utility who has publicly disclosed vulns in their software that people are forced to use for essential utilities like water and power.
[00:03:03] <creek> true
[00:03:17] <creek> usually that falls under "regulation"
[00:03:34] <moose> I'm in the US and have been trying to get some things fixed with a public company and now that I've notified them for years about problems, they have told me to stop looking for issues as it's "abusive"

[00:04:16] <moose> Recently found a forced browse problem and it turned out to be blind sqli on a receipt management system they use that discloses PII for payments.
[00:04:29] <moose> Literally substitute the receipt id. That's it.
[00:06:10] <plasticuproject> stop looking for issues as it's "abusive"
[00:06:13] <plasticuproject> ffs
[00:06:38] <moose> But here it's not legal to be off grid and this is an essential utility and I am required to use their billing platform. I asked if I could pay cash and they said check only and either way it still requires my address/name/etc to be in this vulnerable system.
[00:06:49] <creek> moose, a guy went to prison for that
[00:06:55] <creek> get a lawyer or something
[00:07:10] <moose> creek: I know, which is why I never told them I did anything to find issues but rather said it was publicly disclosed.
[00:07:39] <creek> he found a public site with public information, still went to jail
[00:07:43] <moose> I know.
[00:08:05] <creek> are you in contact with the media?

[00:08:28] <moose> I could be pretty easily, but my complaint to the attorney general actually got a mediation response so I am going to see where that goes.
[00:09:27] <moose> I am thinking it may be a civil rights violation on some level. If a government will charge me with a regulatory violation for not using a system that would expose me to great personal risk, it's a bit of an issue.
[00:10:33] <moose> I was just thinking... public agencies should have a program where you can report security issues and even if they don't pay you, they should be obligated to remediate them.

[00:13:15] <creek> you get way more done when regional stories about unpatched vulns hit the front page
[00:13:30] <creek> no "you" in the equation, except as a source
[00:13:36] <moose> aye
[00:13:38] <moose> much better
[00:13:41] <moose> thanks for the idea
[00:15:37] <creek> good luck.  weird how shaky civil society is becoming in our era
[00:15:43] <creek> thanks for your work, too, i guess
[00:15:51] <creek> esp if you're talking about the north american grid
[00:16:05] <moose> Indeed, US critical infra.
[00:16:24] <creek> I heard the Oregon Bootleg fire almost cost Cali their entire grid
[00:16:37] <creek> would have popped some mega substations or wheelhouses
[00:16:43] <creek> causing an overload statewide
[00:16:44] <moose> This is a national billing system for commercial and residential it appears, too. So there's lots of pivot potential if someone did something. I am sure there's a lot more badness in there as well. Imagine backend stored attacks.
[00:17:01] <creek> correlated to voter databases, etc
[00:17:12] <creek> spooky times, the panopticon is self-assembling
[00:17:20] <moose> yes spooky times
[00:18:53] <moose> There was a time when Energy Northwest had an issue with CGS and some kind of flood gate system. I guess they had a safety system in place that wouldn't allow a diverter to open if a flood limiter was past a certain position but a bug in "ladder code" on some controller was off by 1 and the unit was radians so off by 1 in that position was a big off by 1.
[00:19:47] <moose> So anyway I guess they had an AC frequency spike across a massive portion of the grid and those are apparently not good.
[00:20:32] <moose> I remember wondering like... why are we basically letting nature have a direct influence on the frequency of power. That stuff should be very tightly controlled.
[00:20:53] <Apachez> so hostage situation at a swedish highmax prison today... resolved after 20 kebabpizzas were delivered...
[00:21:16] <Apachez> the swedish police have been disarmed into being pizza delivery boys (and girls)
[00:21:58] <moose> Yeah we give into demands these days. Ransomware, hostages, etc.

[11:34:58] <Apachez> cousin_luigi: example is 7zip who uses aes256 but it turns out that in reality it were more like aes64 (if such would have existed) - this "anomaly" have been fixed
[11:35:13] <Apachez> they didnt properly seed the actual key being used
[11:35:21] <Apachez> so it turned out that half of the bits were always 0's
[11:35:47] <Apachez> so in short the aes256 turned out to be aes128 with half of its bits always set to 0
[11:36:05] <Apachez> so bruteforcing you only had to go through 2^64-1 maximum attempts
[11:36:23] *** Quits: Lord_of_Life (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[11:36:24] <Apachez> other examples is where the seed is broken so the seed is for example always the same value
[11:36:32] <Apachez> or where the seed clusters
[11:36:50] *** Joins: Lord_of_Life (~Lord@user/lord-of-life/x-2819915)
[11:36:56] <Apachez> for example a perfect seed would if you plot it in a 0..1 diagram look like noise evenly distributed in the area
[11:37:31] <Apachez> I forgot which app had that broken implementation but it was also using aes256 but due to broken keydistribution (due to broken seed) the keys clustered in 3-4 areas
[11:37:56] *** Quits: saroy (~sanroy@45.249.73.176) (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:38:00] <Apachez> so in short there were a probability of something like >99% to bruteforce this app who uses aes256 in less than 5 minutes using a regular gpu
[11:38:21] <Apachez> simply because you didnt have to test 2^256-1 keys but far less due to the clustering
[11:38:53] <cousin_luigi> Apachez: Do you think an ONT would have such a problem?
[11:38:56] <Apachez> other examples is when the same key is being reused everywhere which vodaphone made a blooper with some years ago when 3G cell phone networks was a new thing
[11:39:03] <cousin_luigi> Hmmm..
[11:39:12] <Apachez> they released a micro station, basically a small cell tower for indoors use
[11:39:25] <Apachez> that acted like a real cell tower but uplinked to the real one
[11:39:39] <cousin_luigi> Ah.
[11:39:45] <Apachez> anyhow... turned out that these microstations (I forgot their name) used the same key
[11:39:57] <Apachez> so once you got your hands of one of those, extracted the filesystem, found the key
[11:40:18] <Apachez> you could just use that where you wished using openbts and start your own eavesdropping "real" cell tower
[11:40:24] <cousin_luigi> :|
[11:40:42] <Apachez> so just because something says "aes256" doesnt necessary mean its properly coded
[11:40:45] <cousin_luigi> Sounds idiotic. Was it a consequence of mass-producing those gizmos?
[11:40:52] <Apachez> or that it truly is aes256 to begin with
[11:41:12] <Apachez> where broken implementations and broken key distributions are the common root causes of malfunction
[11:41:13] <cousin_luigi> I mean, I recall similar events related to avoiding individual firmware images for each part.
[11:41:30] <Apachez> other than that many of those gears comes with factory passwords and by design backdoors
[11:41:50] <Apachez> so in short dont rely on the logical segmentation that gpon or docsis or similar shared access solutions brings you
[11:41:56] <cousin_luigi> I guess I'll find out more on the ONT they're supposed to install and do some research on it.
[11:42:12] <cousin_luigi> Apachez: I see.
[11:42:55] <Apachez> personally I prefer access networks who dont do shared access
[11:43:04] <Apachez> this way you can also cut off a specific customer if needed
[11:43:23] <cousin_luigi> I wish I had that choice.
[11:43:24] <Apachez> how would you do this with lets say a broken gpon implementation where all nodes use the same key etc?
[11:43:37] <Apachez> so vpn is your friend :P
[11:43:42] <Apachez> from the end customer point of view
[11:43:47] <cousin_luigi> Won't that simply shift my problem elsewhere?
[11:44:06] <Apachez> sure but the vps you terminate your vpn at perhaps isnt as broken as the local access?
[11:44:18] <cousin_luigi> We live in hope.

[13:06:07] <bewees> Are IMSI catcher attacks on google.com common? This was suggested on a credible german news site (article in german https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/ndr-wdr/spaeh-software-pegasus-smartphone-101.html).

[13:08:34] <godSend23> wow cool
[13:09:18] <godSend23> i didn't realize this existed
[13:13:13] <Apachez> there is a misuse of the term "IMSI-catcher"
[13:13:24] <Apachez> an imsi-catcher on its own is just a passive listening device
[13:14:01] <godSend23> oooh
[13:14:03] *** Quits: ElectronApps (~ElectronA@user/electronapps) (Remote host closed the connection)
[13:15:08] <Apachez> so if you got an active device mimicking a true cell tower AND successfully forwarding data upstream the question then is if google isnt already onboard on this
[13:15:48] <godSend23> what do u mean 'onboard'?
[13:16:02] <Apachez> as in approved government device
[13:16:22] <Apachez> you might have noticed that apple, google and microsoft are helping governments all around the world to eavesdrop on their customers
[13:16:41] <godSend23> yeah... that's a given nowadays :/
[13:16:52] <Apachez> but sure if we take the theories
[13:17:07] <Apachez> in order for today to do 100% intercept you dont have to use an imsi catcher
[13:17:17] <Apachez> the provider will reroute the traffic for you under the CALEA flag
[13:17:29] <godSend23> can the device be non-approved gov't device and spy/hack just as well?
[13:17:37] <Apachez> and the same CALEA flag can then be used to extract data from apple, google, microsoft etc
[13:17:45] <Apachez> so there is no actual "hacking" involved
[13:17:58] <godSend23> ohhh... 'legit' then
[13:18:16] <Apachez> and if you go the "illegal" path you can do this yourself with sdr antenna + openbts + laptop
[13:18:30] <Apachez> you will get FCC and similar after you since you are broadcasting on licensed freqs
[13:18:45] <Apachez> there do exists test freqs which you can apply for

[13:18:57] <godSend23> i guess no need Apachez if it's already gov't sanctioned :p
[13:19:00] <Apachez> which then limits both with channels you are allowed to test at but also your tx limit
[13:19:28] <Apachez> the way you do it then is to exploit S7 signaling along with fallback capabilities of the device you want to eavesdrop on
[13:19:48] <Apachez> it basically goes like this... even if  your iphone have set "4g only" this doesnt mean it wont communicate at 2G
[13:20:14] <Apachez> so you first jam the signaling to the true towers by having more power than them towards this device
[13:20:26] <Apachez> along with broadcasting your own channel with a much higher power
[13:20:44] <Apachez> so in short the device will no longer see (well hear ;-) the true towers... only see yours as a valid tower
[13:20:49] *** Joins: caveman (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman)
[13:21:03] <Apachez> however your tower only do 2G (due to degrading attack and since 2G have worser ciphersuites)
[13:21:35] <Apachez> and since the device is eager to stay in contact even if it have this "4g-only" setting it will start to talk with your 2G faked cell tower
[13:21:40] <Apachez> and tada!
[13:21:51] <Apachez> but there are alot of but's and if's around this
[13:22:05] <Apachez> along with making FCC angry if you broadcast on licensed channels
[13:22:27] <Apachez> the SS7 thingy is then done to eavesdrop on the surrounding of the phone
[13:22:41] <Apachez> basically give it a call and when the user disconnects the call it actually isnt disconnected
[13:22:57] <Apachez> since SS7 will ask for permission to disconnect, which your faked cell tower never gives to the device
[13:22:58] <godSend23> what type of intercept device (goes along w/ CALEA) that tech companies are using that we can do use a swell?
[13:23:02] <Apachez> so it stays connected with the mic on :D
[13:23:25] <Apachez> the legit one?
[13:23:30] <Apachez> there is no true intercept
[13:23:34] <Apachez> you just copy the traffic
[13:23:40] <godSend23> yes legit for now
[13:23:45] <Apachez> its just like a port mirror
[13:24:08] <Apachez> whatever comes at int5 (where cust5 is connected) is mirrored to int25 (who then forwards the traffic to the central storage point)

[13:26:07] <godSend23> so IMSI is needless?
[13:26:22] <Apachez> imsi is the sim card identifier when it comes to cellular networks
[13:26:31] <Apachez> where imei is the hardware device id
[13:27:08] <godSend23> and those are the vitals to capture outright initially prior to what u previously mentioned?
[13:27:23] <Apachez> as long as you dont broadcast on licensed freqs you can use a passive imsi catcher to just sit and listen

[13:31:53] <Apachez> if you look at the freqs they are divided in bands and channels

[13:34:10] <godSend23> thanks for explaining this
[13:34:13] <Apachez> but if you set it up at whatever freq is used by lets say T-mobile for their 4G services you will have FCC and others start to home in onto your location and make sure that your transmitter is shutdown, probably also raid your home (just because they can) and finally drag you into court and have you sentenced into prison and/or paying a fine for broadcasting on regulated freqs
[13:35:40] <Apachez> and there are these passive listening boxes setup all over the place so at least in urbanized areas they will quickly triangulate any unlicensed broadcaster

[15:31:49] <bewees> Thanks Apachez! When I travel to a foreign country, can a VPN avoid that their 3G, 4G and 5G networks do a MITM/IMSI catching thing on me? Sure when I browse to google from my VPN the same scenario you explained previously can occure, but not my the foreign entity. Also the dedicated server of the provider where I install my VPN software can do a MITM attack there, but in this case I wonder if I can at least prevent a MITM in that specific foreign country
[15:31:50] <bewees> with a simple VPN?

[15:47:13] <bewees> mnemon: Thanks! I think it's very important to use a VPN when you travel then, not because of they see what you browse, but because they can easily direct you to a website to exploit your phone and gain full control. Now I wonder how capable foreign entities are to do IMSI catching with LTE say in Germany or is LTE still relatively safe in that regard?
[15:48:22] <mnemon> foreign as in not german/their allies?
[15:48:31] <bewees> Yes, not their allies, such as eastern powers
[15:48:56] <mnemon> pretty much impossible to say, can't think of any cases where they would have been caught
[15:50:26] <bewees> Yeah, that's probably classified information and they have counter measures as Apachez elaborated - so guess I try LTE only with grapheneOS which mitigates the fake "4G only" on Iphones that Apachez mentioned
[15:50:41] <fruitypunk> If I where to go to such a country I would consider buying a cheap phone for the trip and leave the real one at home
[15:51:07] <bewees> fruitypunk: That's a good advice! I've been to the countries and will sell the devices soon!

So far they found only backdoor in their "PC Management Software", if I use QubesOS do you think it's likely there are hardware backdoors left or were accusations against Huawei rather a political/economical move against Huawei and they don't use hardware backdoors in their consumer flagships yet? Although Vodafone found backdoors in their enterprise hardware for critical infrastructure, yet I heard
[15:57:18] <bewees> nothing about consumder hardware

[19:38:29] <ilmais1n> Hello
[19:38:50] <ilmais1n> Has this kind of idea ever been seriously considered:
[19:40:13] *** Fufu is now known as FuturePilot
[19:40:37] <ilmais1n> AFAIK current popular kernels like linux are not very effective at providing compartmentalizations with their user account and permission systems, because there are so many privilege escalation bugs
[19:41:25] <ilmais1n> that means that on servers, you want to use different vm for each workload
[19:42:42] *** Quits: terrorjack (~terrorjac@ec2-54-95-39-30.ap-northeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[19:44:13] <ilmais1n> Some people call for more secure operating systems, but what if we gave up with os-level security altogether, and instead developed a single-user os with excellent performance and minimal overhead resource consumption, and run that in those virtual servers, each process/workload in a separate vm?

[20:00:15] <[iz]> if you are using the VM to do stuff, your user data will be there, which is what attackers are actually after
[20:00:22] <ilmais1n> that it is substantially more difficult to escape a vm than to do a os privilege escalation
[20:00:30] <[iz]> it doesn't magically get protected just because it's in a VM
[20:00:48] <ilmais1n> Services need to access user data anyway in order to work
[20:01:06] <[iz]> yes, that's why they get compromised to access user data
[20:01:47] <[iz]> putting that same user data inside the sandbox, which is vuln, but the hacker can't escape easily does nothing to protect the data
[20:02:53] <ilmais1n> i mean that if there was less operating system overhead, maybe it would be cheaper to split things into small vms

[20:31:33] <fruitypunk> it's just way harder to hack hardware enforced isolation with Xen, than it is to escape docker/lxc

[20:36:40] <MadCamel> for isolation and performance I really like the unikernel model. I'm sad it never caught on. Essentially you just build the application into a single bootable binary. The build system can strip all unused functions from the binary as well so good luck finding gadgets for ROP chains.
[20:40:03] <bewees> MadCamel: sounds interesting. Maybe to some extent you can achieve that with Gentoo, compile only the most necessary libraries into kernel and userspace application you need for that service to run in that KVM/QEMU
[20:41:37] <MadCamel> right. There's also ways to strip docker/lxc containers down pretty well. But nothing quite as advanced.

[22:49:42] <chives2> ajak, maybe the real question is what is not a joke sadly
[22:50:10] <chives2> Was reading that now the sam db in windows is open to all users to read?
[22:50:20] <ajak> well, presumably you're not a joke
[22:50:38] <chives2> if my job is as a clown
[22:52:05] <chives2> i feel like every single platform i use is mitm'd
[22:52:31] <chives2> or even the websites are a "fake" front that regex's some taint for mitm to the real site behind the scenes
[22:53:02] <ajak> are you averse to reverse proxies or something? :p
[22:53:08] <chives2> the problem exists where ever i go

[23:00:15] <chives2> Are there any search engines that still work?  I can't even get google to respond to simple search syntax anymore if i'm requiring a certain search term in the results its not even impacting the results

[23:02:23] <menace> i got used to writing hippa like hippo i have to admit

[23:08:09] <chives2> chats are mitm'd
[23:08:18] <chives2> for all websites that i can tell from amazon to walmart
[23:08:45] <ajak> chats aren't p2p so obviously they're mitm'd
[23:15:28] <chives2> sad thing is i dont even know how to vote... you know... what is "facebook" is my "view" of this corruption even anything to do with facebook... or amazon or walmart... or even anywhere i go people of full jurisdiction to mistreat me
[23:15:44] <chives2> How do you make choices in all of this?

[23:17:25] <chives2> food is expired in walmart, fast food places tamper with your food
[23:18:14] <MadCamel> there's no anonymity or neutrality because people don't care. If people cared they'd stop using services like facebook or discord.
[23:18:40] <creek> somehow, despite enjoying social media, i never used discord
[23:18:53] <creek> might have been their TLD, reads like "giggety"
[23:19:17] <chives2> they dont have a choice though not really do they... i mean you pretty much need a facebook now like you need internet

[23:19:30] <MadCamel> As long as these companies can make money from abusing their users they will continue to do so. Legislation seems to help but they just work around it.
[23:19:40] <beanbag-> looks like akami had a bad day
[23:19:41] <beanbag-> heh
[23:20:16] <chives2> im behind the times i think folks have multiple i cant even post on mine because im not sure ill be able to change it later, but at least i can chat / see what other folks post
[23:20:45] <MadCamel> and yeah not much of a choice sometimes. Like I've had women bail out on dates because I don't have a facebook profile and that's apparently a huge red flag in the modern dating scene.
[23:21:31] <chives2> mine would probably be pretty close because the i get weird errors on it and things go missing like the delete button
[23:21:40] <chives2> so im afraid to post if i cant delete it
[23:22:32] <chives2> im getting weird pop ups in firefox... i mean its just a huge... I don't know its like a "big con"
[23:22:50] <MadCamel> you are a product, get used to it :)
[23:23:25] <chives2> what kind of product is desired
[23:23:28] <creek> nobody needs "a facebook"
[23:23:30] <creek> nobody
[23:24:49] <[iz]> creek, always pushing facebook on even nobody :b
[23:25:29] <chives2> thats the thing everyone has crazy names
[23:25:34] <chives2> nothing is real anymore
[23:25:39] <[iz]> i think the trick w/ facebook in this decade is to treat it like evite.com as a site
[23:26:31] <[iz]> no posting, no browsing, just use it to receive, accept/decline invites to things
[23:27:49] <chives2> well its good to have social interaction im pretty much a hermit so like seeing what civilization is doing but the platform is a problem... and it's more than that... i feel morally obligated not to be a part of it really but how do you make that choice, cognitive dissonance is the good worth the bad, making it ok to be... well terrorized
[23:28:41] <MadCamel> yeah I get what you're saying
[23:29:14] <MadCamel> if it makes you feel any better, I don't have a facebook still, and managed to find someone to date who didn't care. It was just a bit more difficult
[23:29:33] <chives2> MadCamel, did you not use tech?
[23:30:05] <chives2> All of the dating sites are intercepted apparently in my case it's not even a paranoia its just a fact of life
[23:30:08] <chives2> its the norm
[23:30:31] <chives2> my profiles are even edited without me
[23:30:45] <chives2> I don't know what this is but it should be illegal
[23:30:51] <MadCamel> I used tech. But I mean what are you going to do? Hey baby I don't feel safe chatting here, please install Signal?
[23:30:56] <chives2> it's definitely insecure, does security exist
[23:31:25] <chives2> is signal even safe nowadays if the platform is intercepted I don't know how it could be
