[00:11:20] <Seirdy> uwharrie: yes, unless you're struggling to do something like video encoding i'd actually recommend disabling SMT if you use x86_64, esp. if you use intel. the mitigations nerf the benefits quite a bit, so it's only a very slight speedup. the downside is that SMT basically generates vulns as a function of time.
[00:11:38] <ayecee> patriksarah: it's a bad cause because you have no authority to do what you're trying to do.

[00:34:54] <patriksarah> Okay so sine we are changing subject.... i managed to sign kernel modules (for booting with oracle VM), instead of disabling secure boot. IS there anyway i can undo that and restore to how it was before?
[00:35:13] <Jeffreyson> cowsay > cat
[00:35:22] <ayecee> patriksarah: undo which part?
[00:35:24] <patriksarah> i wanted to try another OS in ORacle VM and didnt know i could disable secure boot and instead started signing kernel modules
[00:35:32] <patriksarah> the whole secure boot keys part
[00:35:42] <mar77i> patriksarah: ...reading recent backlog like I stepped into one of those therapists. oh I know how this works: how did your childhood go, are you realizing yet that society conspires to see you fail, why are you still doing shit that you're going to fill up with excuses when you're old, like "I had no choice", "I gave it my best" and "my parents wanted me to be this stupid" :)
[00:35:43] <ayecee> sure, disable secure boot. done.
[00:35:44] <patriksarah> whenevre i start my computer and enable secure boot and i want to boot using my USB harddrive it fails
[00:36:18] <jim> yeah, it won't let anything unknown boot
[00:36:20] <patriksarah> is there anything negative with always running with secure boot disabled?
[00:36:43] <ayecee> of course.

On a recent ubuntu live disk it's recognized as "I2C HID v1.00 Keyboard [GXTP7380:00 27C6:0113] on i2c-GXTP7380:00" by hid-generic and hid-multitouch. The relevant modules seem to be hid{,_generic,_multitouch} and i2c_{algo_bit,hid,hid_acpi,i801,smbus}. I have all of those as well, but it's not being
[03:24:50] <apo> recognized (in dmesg). The ubuntu kernel's a 5.13, I'm on 5.15. Does anybody have better ideas than "copy the ubuntu config, then start bisecting until you're back to yours plus whatever's needed"?

[06:57:55] <Dagmar> It seems like it would just be easier to extract what little that matters from the original file and then use something else that speaks yaml to generate a new file

[07:00:38] <Guest89> rbox what I am doing is all manual stuff. scripting it won't be a big deal too. What I am looking for is to see if there are already a utility which could do this for me (in this wast ocean of tools related to containerisation)
[07:00:54] <rbox> like docker?

[07:02:04] <Guest89> @rbox exactly, but I don't need all bells and whistles of docker. Also I don't want to run based on docker images. I am looking for running binaries sitting on my machine.
[07:02:11] <IndirectPut> pnbeast: I had already typed it out, then I decided to dodge traffic and be more polite by greeting first. :)
[07:02:17] <pnbeast> Salutations, on the other hand - pretty much a requirement in IRC.
[07:02:20] <rbox> Guest89: well if you already know how to do it...
[07:02:41] <stanrifkin_> are there some gui tools for systemd?
[07:03:03] <rbox> what do you want a systemd gui to do?
[07:03:23] <IndirectPut> So, this system does 'echo freeze >/sys/power/state' just fine when booted normally, but within the initramfs (dracut, pro-mount), it gets stuck with a textmode cursor in the upper left corner. I have a hunch it's the i915 driver's missing, as it gets loaded only after pivot, though S2Idle is said to work without driver support.
[07:03:51] <IndirectPut> *pre-mount
[07:03:54] <Guest89> rbox all I need is network namespace and UTS namespace. Let me look around:) ¬†Thank you!

[07:07:38] <IndirectPut> It's also stuck so hard that only long-pressing the power button will work.  What I originally set out to is to get S2RAM working, for which I wanted to rule out problems due to the full root FS being attached via USB ‚Äî hence trying from initramfs.

[09:00:20] <tirnanog> at any rate, read the manual rather than guess.
[09:00:26] <loganlee> pluri: https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/ says send HUP signal like this kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)
[09:00:48] <tirnanog> but did you read what SIGHUP actually means to rsync?
[09:00:51] <tirnanog> er, rclone.
[09:00:53] <tirnanog> probably not.
[09:01:00] <tirnanog> I highly doubt it's HUP that is appropriate.

[09:01:28] <pluri> I'm trying to unmount + shut it down

[09:02:35] <tirnanog> rather than relying on random people in IRC to half-do it for you.
[09:02:56] <pluri> well the question was actually how to simulate ctrl+c because i already knew that was the right way to close it. but yeah, manual confirms both work: "When the program ends while in foreground mode, either via Ctrl+C or receiving a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, the mount should be automatically  stopped."
[09:03:07] <pnbeast> That's not fair.  There are people in here who will do google searches for you, too!
[09:03:14] <pluri> no, i actually wanted to learn what ctrl+c does
[09:03:19] <tirnanog> pluri: great. so a simple pkill should deliver the goods.
[09:03:20] <pluri> in a general way, not just for rclone
[09:03:28] <tirnanog> or kill if you happen to know the pid already.
[09:03:42] <tirnanog> there is no "general way".
[09:03:48] <pluri> the default signal sent by pkill is SIGTERM right?

[09:07:10] <tirnanog> pluri: for a practical example of how that can be a meaningful distinction, imagine you issue a pipeline in the shell.
[09:07:42] <tirnanog> pluri: the commands that form this pipeline will usually belong to the same process group.

[13:41:00] <DPA> Oh, I didn't know that. That'd make things easier. Although, you could access environment variables of other processes of the same user using /proc/<pid>/environ. If I just set dbpassword="password", or maybe local dbpassword="password" in bash, without exporting it, it's probably fine, I think.

[16:50:50] <wr> is that On my BIOS all values are, but i installed Debian also from 0, so the issue is solved but i don't know what was causing it, thing is i cannot have a fan reversed on 4 pin connector, anyways...

[17:15:28] <jim> iomari891, if you're talking about LVM, maybe it would be helpful to know the parts of it: with partitions, you make partitions using a partition tool, format them with a filesystem directly, and mount the partition with the filesystem. with LVM, instead of putting filesystems in partitions directly, you put 'LVM physical volumes' in partitions, then you make a 'volume group' (which is just a list of physical volumes), and put physical volumes in the
[17:15:28] <jim> volume groups, then you can make 'logical volumes', and these are what you would format and mount, and they got allocated from a volume group.

[18:40:55] <cdown> the oom killer has no idea when your machine is out of memory, it only knows when we tried extremely hard for a sustained period to get some memory and failed.
[18:41:11] <cdown> so waiting for it to run is another example of how not to run things in prod.
[18:41:26] <cdown> and if you wouldn't run it like that in prod, i have no idea why i'd run it like that on my laptop, or my desktop.

[18:42:52] <cdown> and the way that's calculated is... not good.
[18:42:59] <cdown> or rather, it can't be good, because it knows nothing about your workload.

[22:31:14] <Henry151> so.. i've got a big bucket on backblaze b2, that was a backup of my media server.. i am trying to extract certain media from it, onto my new b2 bucket that will host the media for my new media server setup. I think I'm doing it wrong and want some input. The way I'm doing it, is i made two rclone mounts, one of the backup bucket, and one of the new media bucket, on my media server, and i'm using rsync to
[22:31:20] <Henry151> copy files from the one mounted rclone bucket to the other. This seems to be going excruciatingly slowly. It occurred to me this morning that perhaps it would be faster and work better, to instead use rclone directly to copy files straight from the one bucket to the other. Thoughts?
