[21:40:35] <river> one step at a time

[22:26:35] <shapr> Wow, I guess my extremely wide range of interests is more broadly known that I expected.
[22:27:08] <shapr> Speaking of which 1. I got the antique radio to pick up AM and 2. I'm still bad at sharpening a straight razor
[22:27:12] <legit> kronk: computing and programming related things - at least those are the one's I'm interested in
[22:27:49] <kronk> legit: cool. hand me your e-mail in DM.
[22:27:52] <shapr> the vacuum tubes light up in the radio! https://recurse.social/@shapr/107889722726515750

[22:28:39] <shapr> I haven't written anything lately that's good for submitting to lobsters :-(
[22:28:42] <shapr> but that's about to change!
[22:29:07] <shapr> My new full time quest is building tools that simplify meaningful social interaction across the internet
[22:29:35] <companion_cube> so you're going to work on IRCv3 ?
[22:29:37] <companion_cube> ;)
[22:29:49] <legit> or the metaverse
[22:30:02] <shapr> I think my starting point is a "friend finder" where you can mark the next hour as free, and your friends can click on a notification(?) to jump into a video chat
[22:30:18] <shapr> I also realized I'd like a FUSE CRDT so I could easily work on code with others.
[22:30:31] <shapr> I tried sshfs with auto-revert in emacs, that's really slow
[22:30:33] <kronk> that would be interesting.
[22:30:43] <shapr> kronk: which part?
[22:30:45] <kronk> a filesystem CRDT.
[22:30:47] <shapr> yeah!
[22:31:03] <kronk> you could probably hack something up pretty easily.
[22:31:10] <technomancy> might mess about and build the torment nexus later
[22:31:23] <kronk> but that depends on whether you see the world as chunks of bits or as formatted text.
[22:31:29] <companion_cube> there's this json CRDT, maybe a filesystem abstraction on top is doable?
[22:31:37] <shapr> companion_cube: what/where?
[22:31:46] <shapr> technomancy: the what?
[22:31:51] <companion_cube> http://automerge.org/
[22:31:51] <mockturtle> [ Automerge CRDT | Automerge CRDT ] - automerge.org
[22:32:42] <kronk> you'd want the text CRDT from that package.
[22:32:53] <shapr> Last time I dug into CRDTs they had space issues because you could never be sure when all clients had consumed even part of the message stream
[22:32:55] <legit> kronk: thanks!
[22:32:57] <technomancy> shapr: it's a metaverse joke https://nitter.net/AlexBlechman/status/1457842724128833538
[22:32:58] <mockturtle> [ Alex Blechman (@AlexBlechman) ] - nitter.net
[22:33:04] <companion_cube> ah well, yes
[22:33:23] <companion_cube> in *practice* I imagine you could do a not-really-crdt that erases dead information after a month or so
[22:33:36] <kronk> I don't think you need a CRDT for doing what you're looking for.
[22:33:44] <kronk> much less over the whole filesystem.
[22:33:55] <shapr> technomancy: oh I see. I was in fact thinking about meaningful social interaction that is the opposite of facebutt, twitter, etc
[22:34:14] <kronk> some combination between a file watcher, autosaving and sshfs-but-not-shit.
[22:34:17] <shapr> That is, participation required rather than broadcast of signaling
[22:34:35] <kronk> could hook into inotify.
[22:34:36] <technomancy> no that's cool
[22:34:46] <kronk> and then just do a diff. would work for smaller-ish files.
[22:35:01] <shapr> but how do you get less than one second latency?
[22:35:02] <technomancy> I feel like building meaningful user ownership is nearly impossible with the way current ISPs do NAT tho
[22:35:03] <kronk> basically real-time git!
[22:35:11] <shapr> technomancy: I agree, don't know how to beat that
[22:35:15] <kronk> you don't. you'd need to own nearly the whole stack for that, shapr.
[22:35:18] <shapr> IPv6 would do it, but ..
[22:35:41] <shapr> kronk: or steal pieces from the VoIP stack?
[22:35:58] <shapr> technomancy: cheese around it with one of the mesh networks?
[22:36:08] <kronk> was moreso referring to the concept of latency between hosts. just do remote development on the same host.
[22:36:18] <technomancy> I feel like this is maybe the biggest way the free software movement dropped the ball
[22:36:45] <shapr> hm, I could stuff CRDT updates into the RTP stream
[22:36:46] <kronk> the internet wasn't designed to cope with hundreds of billions of nodes all talking to eachother.
[22:36:54] <technomancy> they have all this wankery around shunning people who use firmware blobs and they completely missed the boat on actually makingit possible to own your own data
[22:36:55] <kronk> that's why we have a backbone.
[22:37:24] <kronk> all the specs don't point to "we planned for quadrillions of tiny computers each functioning on a lossy link to a larger swarm".
[22:37:44] <kronk> it was built for large mainframes who's addressing scheme was finite enough.
[22:37:44] <shapr> I also want to encourage macro level improvements for virtual interaction, things like "use headphones so we don't need echo cancellation" and "get a real microphone so we can hear you"
[22:38:37] <kronk> shapr: if you want meaningful change like that, make it so my aeropex aftershokz can use full-fidelity voice.
[22:38:44] <kronk> then I can be anywhere anytime.
[22:39:04] <shapr> amusingly, I did start reverse engineering the firmware of the xtrainerz last week
[22:39:10] <kronk> reallllyyyyy.
[22:39:16] <shapr> but realized I need fewer rabbit holes, not more
[22:39:17] <kronk> curious to know more, and how you dumped it.
[22:39:28] <kronk> and whether the same can happen to the aftershokz.
[22:39:34] <shapr> oh, I submitted a feature request to shokz, and their tech support people got confused and sent me docs on updating the firmware
[22:39:53] <shapr> which led to me downloading the firmware
[22:39:54] <kronk> huuuuh. how do update firmware on non-xtrainerz.
[22:40:02] <shapr> I haven't found anything about that
[22:40:24] <kronk> well now you have me wanting a pair of xtrainerz. :P
[22:40:34] <shapr> they're OpenSwim now, and they're pretty good
[22:41:01] <kronk> wow they've really rebranded some of their stuff.
[22:41:31] <shapr> kronk: speaking of aeropex voice, that looks like their OpenComm model
[22:41:56] <kronk> the aftershokz do have a mic but it can't be used unless you're in that crappy bluetooth-but-bitcrushed mode.
[22:41:57] <shapr> and they claim openrun and openrun pro are upgraded aeropex
[22:42:11] <shapr> that's a bluetooth limitation last I checked
[22:42:18] <kronk> yeah it is.
[22:42:22] <kronk> wow, these look neat.
[22:42:24] <shapr> bluetooth has a 'real time' mono channel
[22:42:34] <bkero> lol a2dp
[22:42:42] <shapr> whereas A2DP is stereo, sorta quality, and not real time

[22:43:10] <kronk> I'm glad someone's doing bone conduction stuff, they seem like the only company doing that right now.
[22:43:16] <kronk> that's commercially available and viable.
[22:43:26] <shapr> kronk: other companies trying to catch up and steal their customers
[22:43:35] <shapr> but the other options are meh at best

[22:46:49] <lep> i assume you are all SEO experts here. can i provide a list of all sites i have? i have an api search engine but i guess it would be nice to directly jump to a specific doc site

[22:48:19] <kronk> find some way to map common body language signals to recognizable symbols and display that below a video feed.
[22:48:36] <kronk> you lose a lot of that outside of regular human-to-human physical communication.
[22:48:45] <kronk> patent it and make billions.
[22:49:05] <kronk> "oh it looks like XYZ wants to jump in" "looks like you're disagreeing, whaddup".
[22:49:19] <companion_cube> oh yeah, map body language to emojis
[22:49:25] <companion_cube> or bitmojis
[22:49:25] <kronk> yeeee boi
[22:49:25] <shapr> maybe it's easier to train humans to talk about those issues?
[22:49:35] <companion_cube> and then: "you spend 95% of the time shrugging"
[22:49:37] <kronk> nah you're not thinking in a solution-first mindset.
[22:50:08] <kronk> which is what video chat is for anyway.
[22:50:40] <shapr> lep: you can assign a single letter to a 'search engine' in firefox, I have 'h' jump to https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=%s
[22:51:15] <shapr> that way one letter in your browser url bar can both jump to and search a specific doc site
[22:51:22] <lep> that's not the concern
[22:51:36] <lep> concern is that google simply wont be indexing those sites
[22:51:43] <lep> since they aren't really linked from outside
[22:52:23] <lep> (it's actually exactly like hoogle, my small search engine :)
[22:53:23] <shapr> I'm lost, what is the concern?
[22:54:01] <lep> like i have a `/doc/<fn-name>` site which wont be found via google i guess
[22:54:06] <lep> because nobody links to it
[22:54:25] <lep> idk, im fine with just using my own engine but that's the concern from somebody
[22:54:25] <shapr> why do you want it found by google?
[22:54:33] <lep> ^
[22:54:54] <lep> guess it's their workflow
[22:54:55] <shapr> I don't remember the details, but I think you can list in your robots.txt
[22:55:30] <lep> never looked into robots. always assumed it was more to forbid pages
