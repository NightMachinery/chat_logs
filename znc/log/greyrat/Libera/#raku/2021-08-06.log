[00:37:06] <Util> lizmat: thanks for writing pull #4484. I will revisit after the conference.
[00:37:21] <lizmat> sure...  :-)

[00:55:48] <JRaspass> is require not meant to work inside a for loop/
[00:56:17] <JRaspass> if so, "Cannot invoke this object (REPR: Null; VMNull)" aint a great message

[01:19:30] <Xliff> If a compunuit is spending alomost 4 seconds in stag mbc, is there a possibility that it is not being precompiled?
[01:41:53] <ugexe> i think you are misunderstanding your example JRaspass
[01:41:59] <ugexe> m: for <Test NativeCall> { say try require ::($_) }
[01:41:59] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2c0343b5b: OUTPUT: «(Test)␤(NativeCall)␤»
[01:42:46] <JRaspass> It's just postfix it doesn't like, interesting
[01:42:47] <ugexe> oh wait i misunderstood... i didnt even see the `for`
[01:45:31] <JRaspass> m: for "Test" { require ::($_) }
[01:45:31] <camelia> rakudo-moar 2c0343b5b: ( no output )
[01:45:41] <JRaspass> yeah block for is fine, postfix dies, this smells like a bug
[01:46:19] <ugexe> yeah unfortunately i think `require` escapes lexical scope
[01:46:25] <ugexe> or maybe fortunately if you want to look at it like that
[01:46:51] <ugexe> unfortunately because `use` statements are lexical
[01:47:02] <ugexe> require leaks out
[01:48:50] <ugexe> hmmm thats not strictly true either
[01:49:07] <ugexe> it is true in one case or another... i just forget which one :)
[01:49:35] *** jess is now known as j
[01:52:40] <JRaspass> So is it a bug? For now I'll use a block loop
[01:54:54] <ugexe> if its a bug its probably more a compile time thing with postfix instead of specifically e.g. require
[01:58:27] <ugexe> er no that wouldnt make sense, its require no compile time heh
[02:00:07] <JRaspass> I don't really grok why the variable has to be so dynamic either
[02:00:42] <JRaspass> The docs say "The compunit name can be in a runtime variable if you put it inside an indirect lookup.", but not really why
[02:01:03] <JRaspass> dynamic is the wrong word but you know what i mean

[02:09:19] <ugexe> if you mean why cant you just use a string, probably because its just too ambiguous as to what it could represent
[02:11:06] <ugexe> i.e. module name, a path, some other spec for theoretical curs like http urls
[02:11:45] <ugexe> thats not the greatest reason though so maybe thats less likely than i implied
[02:13:25] <JRaspass> require by path would actually be pretty useful for my purposes, im dynamically trying to load all the modules in a dir
[02:13:44] <gfldex> Maybe require tries to turn it's argument into Package unless it already is one?
[02:13:49] <ugexe> you can require by path
[02:15:28] <JRaspass> I can!? ooo
[02:15:46] <ugexe> raku -I. -e 'require "lib/Zef.rakumod"; say "ok"'
[02:15:48] <ugexe> ok
[02:16:01] <JRaspass> Hah, I really went the long way around then
[02:16:15] <JRaspass> I have: for dir 'lib/Local/Routes', :test(*.ends-with: '.rakumod') { require ::("Local::Routes::{.extension('').basename}"); }
[02:17:59] <ugexe> that dir code isnt for an installable distribution though right?

[02:20:30] <JRaspass> Nah this is just a cro app trying to load some libs, i am being a bit evil and assuming lib is in the cwd
[02:20:40] <JRaspass> I didn't know what the raku equiv of @INC was
[02:22:14] <ugexe> something like `$?DISTRIBUTION.meta<provides>.grep({ $_.key.starts-with("lib/Local/Routes") }).map({ require $_.value; ::($_.key) })`
[02:23:03] <ugexe> might work
[02:23:05] <JRaspass> Ah none of this is in the meta
[02:23:12] <JRaspass> this is an app rather than a dist
[02:23:23] <ugexe> yeah but you still are putting your app files in a lib/
[02:23:35] <JRaspass> sure
[02:24:26] <JRaspass> What does `-I` and `RAKUDOLIB` influence? There must be an array of lib paths somewhere?

[02:26:33] <gfldex> `use lib <./>` points to the $CWD .

[02:42:29] <ugexe> should probably make CURI work with relative paths... no reason it shouldnt afaict
[02:42:51] <ugexe> i.e. `require "lib/Test.rakumod";` might as well just work
[02:43:28] *** Joins: juanfra__ (~juanfra@user/juanfra)
[02:44:07] <ugexe> at the very least it would require a slow path though since we wouldnt have the sha1 of the module name itself

[23:24:08] <timo> another random aside for you codesections,  hyperoperators are hyper,  which is the opposite end of lazy,  normally find with a lazy list will not do more work than necessary and can also wrok on infinite lists, which using hyperoperators will not allow. also, pointing the pointy end at both arguments means thne lists are allowed to be of different lengths which may not be what you want
