[01:46:24] <TimMc> (McCormack)
[01:46:32] <Me-me> I see, I see.
[01:48:16] <TimMc> When I say my name quickly, the most prominent syllable break ends up after the "Mc", so it seemed natural. :-)
[01:48:42] <Me-me> Indeed.
[01:49:06] <dTal> Timmock Ormack.
[01:49:12] <TimMc> exactly :-)
[01:49:31] <dTal> could even be Irish
[01:49:35] <dTal> Timmock O'rmack.
[01:49:43] <TimMc> haha oh no
[01:50:47] <dTal> I was thinking of how to make it Welsh but in actual fact you'd just be called Dave Jones
[01:50:58] <TimMc> I mean, it might *be* an Irish name. My dad has traced his ancestry to mostly English people but... there are a lot of untraced branches and so there's almost certainly Scottish and Irish in there too.
[01:51:22] <dTal> McCormack is definitely scottish
[01:51:42] <TimMc> That's what I've heard, but it seems like the kind of thing that could change spelling over time.
[01:52:08] <dTal> are you one of them murricans
[01:52:12] <TimMc> (Specifically, I've heard that, and that McCormick is irish.)
[01:52:20] <TimMc> sure am
[01:52:47] <TimMc> Where I grew up (central Virginia) there were plenty of micks and very, very few macks.
[01:52:56] <TimMc> (pronounced the same way, mind you)
[01:53:06] <dTal> huh
[01:53:07] <TimMc> But now that I'm up in Boston there are a lot of macks!
[01:53:15] <dTal> see I thought it was the Mc that gave it away
[01:53:34] <dTal> Mc<something> is scottish like O'<something> is Irish
[01:54:02] <dTal> that's the stereotype anyway

[01:55:11] <dTal> the "mack" part was probably also... yeah
[01:55:35] <Me-me> Wow I totally missed that you said exactly what I said, before I said it. Ignore me.
[01:55:50] <TimMc> Whoa, check out this alphabet! https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%9A%8B%E1%9A%90%E1%9A%8A%E1%9A%94#Primitive_Irish
[01:56:03] <TimMc> Ogham, very cool.
[01:56:58] <TimMc> Me-me: heh, no worries
[01:57:13] <TimMc> But yeah, I think "Mac" shows up in Irish as well.
[01:58:00] <TimMc> My ancestry doesn't turn up any McCors or Cormacks, but I've definitely encountered Cormack as a surname.

[03:12:26] <mdogg> [itchyjunk]: Are you referring to the lack of a comma in the title of the article?  "Find anything blazingly fast with Google's vector search technology"?
[03:12:53] <mdogg> Oh - perhaps you guys are talking about something else.
[03:13:08] <LjL> TIL "supposably" is a word
[03:16:10] <Me-me> Sure. Something can be supposed, and something can be supposable. Both can be turned into adjectives.
[03:16:13] <mdogg> LjL: It is a word, but I do not care for it at all.  I prefer using "supposedly" as the adverb.
[03:16:17] <Me-me> Or, indeed, adverbs.
[03:17:01] <LjL> mdogg, "supposably" supposedly means something else
[03:17:09] <LjL> it being only used as "supposedly" erroneously
[03:17:36] <Me-me> Aye.
[03:17:51] <LjL> Me-me, just because you can apply a transform to a word in theory due to a suffix that exists, doesn't always mean it's attested or sensible
[03:18:03] <LjL> but in this case it appears to be... well, at least one of those things, at least to some extent
[03:18:08] <LjL> and that's what i learned!
[03:18:20] <Me-me> Haha!
[03:18:28] * Me-me signs the report card for the day.
[03:18:34] * Me-me affixes sticker.
[03:18:41] <mdogg> I agree with your statements there, LjL.
[03:19:35] * LjL collects them like radio amateurs collect QSL cards, except without a license
[03:19:36] <mdogg> The word "supposably" makes me cringe when I hear it for some reason.
[03:20:17] <LjL> mdogg, you can use "conceivably", "imaginably", "plausibly", "presumably"
[03:20:36] <mdogg> Those are all great words.
[03:20:37] <mdogg> ^
[03:21:02] <Me-me> I imagine you've got a simple conditioned reaction to the word because of the aforementioned erroneous use.
[03:22:19] <LjL> i'd say that's supposable
[03:22:44] <LjL> but also
[03:23:00] <mdogg> Or, "Presumably you have a simple conditional reaction to the word because of the aforementioned erroneous use."  That sounds much better than, "Supposably you have a simple conditional reaction to the word because of the aforementioned erroneous use."
[03:23:01] <LjL> it might not be entirely detrimental to be naturally averse to words that have subtly different meanings yet are very similar in form
[03:23:04] <[itchyjunk]> mdogg, not the title
[03:23:28] <LjL> it may minimize misunderstanding, which is a property language probably seeks, as it is quite highly redundant
[03:23:58] <LjL> mdogg, can you describe *why* it sounds much better though? it's not music
[03:28:11] <mdogg> LjL: I was thinking about that..  I guess I would say that it is because 'one can presume' or 'one can suppose' or one can conceive' or 'imagine'.  But when one "supposes" or "assumes" something, it is 'supposedly' a certain way.  
[03:28:21] *** Quits: AsenMx (~AsenMx@user/asenmx) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:28:54] <LjL> but "supposedly" comes from "supposed" meaning that someone has supposed (or at least that there is a being-supposed in a vacuum)
[03:29:00] <mdogg> Does "supposably" come from the word "supposition"?
[03:29:00] *** Joins: AsenMx (~AsenMx@user/asenmx)
[03:29:06] <LjL> "supposable" (and hence supposably) only say that it *can be* supposed
[03:29:19] <LjL> no, it comes from the word suppose
[03:29:29] <LjL> which supposition also comes from, but separately
[03:29:52] <LjL> -able is the same as in presume, presumably. nothing unusual there
[03:29:56] <LjL> presume, presumable, presumably*
[03:30:15] <LjL> somehow we say presume, presumed, but not (often) *presumedly
[03:31:33] <LjL> but we say allege, alleged, allegedly. not allege, *alleg...iable... i don't even know how to spell it
[03:31:38] <LjL> so there's a bit of both
[03:31:41] <mdogg> OOH

[12:12:11] <twb> "the calcuation" sounds like ONE run through an algorithm

[12:13:56] <twb> "The air conditioning algorithm is derived from historical weather data and corresponding temperature extremes."

[22:39:19] <brigand> "I participate /in/ as a trainee"?
[22:39:53] <brigand> I would change the second sentence to "Thanks for the immersive classes, they were informative and insightful".
