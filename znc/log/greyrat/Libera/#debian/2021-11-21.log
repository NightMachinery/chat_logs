[05:32:21] <Daisenryaku> let's say i compile a program from source that requires libX and libY, which i both install from apt. is there a way i can make a dummy entry or package so that apt autoremove doesn't remove them ?

[05:33:46] *** Joins: lepke (~lepke@user/lepke)
[05:33:47] <n4dir> Daisenryaku: i don't think if you installed them with apt, without them being a dependency, they will be removed with autoremove.
[05:33:47] <sney> if it's only a couple packages, you can 'apt-mark manual' them
[05:33:52] <sney> otherwise there is equivs,
[05:33:56] <sney> !equivs
[05:33:56] <dpkg> equivs is a package that enables you to create dummy packages that tell <apt> you really have installed (through some other means) the package.  apt install equivs, and read /usr/share/doc/equivs/*, see also <usrlocal>.  A better plan is often to adapt the Debian packages to your needs, ask me about <package recompile> <uupdate> <ssb>.
[05:35:15] <Daisenryaku> thanks!
[05:35:35] <n4dir> sney: never had the need to use apt-mark, hence don't know it well. Doesn't it just do something like "make this package as if it was installed manually, that is not as a dependency?

[05:36:48] <sney> n4dir: yeah, in this case it removes the 'automatically installed' flag so autoremove will not consider it. it can also hold packages to prevent them from upgrading
[05:37:27] <n4dir> got you. The question is if the what Daisenryaku described doesn't to that already in the first place
[05:37:47] *** Quits: tomg (~tomg@user/tomg) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:37:54] <n4dir> sney: i seem to recall instead of apt-mark manual usage, you might just as well let autoremove remove them, then install them manually
[05:38:02] <n4dir> but if you did that already in the first place ...
[05:38:02] <Daisenryaku> (my first idea was to put a dummy package into /var/lib/dpkg status)
[05:38:04] <sney> that would do the same thing

[08:24:36] <Spawns_Carpeting> hello, how do you start system services on debian 11? systemctl start seems to not work, and looking in etc it seems debian uses some rc scripts instead of regular systemd service files which is ver strange
[08:28:04] <Spawns_Carpeting> I am trying to start ufw, doing systemctl start didn't work and neither did /etc/init.d/ufw start
[08:28:20] <Spawns_Carpeting> those are the 'normal' methods on most systems
[08:30:35] *** Quits: ddsys (~ddsys@user/ddsys) (Quit: Leaving)
[08:31:02] <noord> Spawns_Carpeting: what is output of `systemctl status ufw`
[08:31:44] <noord> and `ufw status`
[08:32:14] <Spawns_Carpeting> ufw status says "inactive" but systemctl status says started and active
[08:33:30] <noord> you forgot to enable it
[08:33:33] <noord> `ufw enable`
[08:34:02] <noord> make sure ssh port is added before disconnect if it is on remote server
[08:34:24] <Spawns_Carpeting> shouldn't the service enable it? I figured the service would run that for me, but now that you mention it I think you are right
[08:34:31] <Spawns_Carpeting> it just runs 'ufw start'
[08:34:38] <Spawns_Carpeting> or something like that
[08:35:09] <Spawns_Carpeting> hm that can't be right either
[08:35:41] <Spawns_Carpeting> if the service itself won't activate it when invoking manually how is it going to when rebooting?
[08:35:54] <noord> systemctl status show whether is it enabled (it means run automatically on every startup)
[08:36:19] <noord> Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ufw.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) you must see this line
[08:36:55] <Spawns_Carpeting> I mean enabled in terms of 'ufw status'. if running 'systemctl start ufw' manually leaves ufw inactive when querying it via 'ufw status', won't the same thing happen on reboot?
[08:38:02] <Spawns_Carpeting> on my gentoo system just starting the service has the same effect as running 'ufw enable' manually
[08:38:18] <Spawns_Carpeting> so long as it works i'm okay with it I guess, that just threw me off
[08:38:42] <noord> I am not sure what does ufw internally but I believe ufw status is about activeness about rules
[08:39:51] <rk4> if you get sick of ufw...nftables is nice ;)

[08:44:17] <noord> Spawns_Carpeting: long story short your issue will be fixed by running `ufw enable` and `systemctl enable ufw`

[08:46:42] <rk4> https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Simple_ruleset_for_a_workstation , rules live in /etc/nftables.conf

[08:47:30] <Spawns_Carpeting> that did fix it noord thank you
[08:49:55] <Spawns_Carpeting> i imagine most things are a bit more complicated than ufw hah
[08:49:58] <Spawns_Carpeting> its in the name
[08:50:22] <rk4> i believe the opposite! i use ufw at work, and then i run 'iptables -L' and realise i have nfi what's going on
[08:52:35] <noord> rk4: everyone doesn't need details of what is going on
[08:55:51] <Spawns_Carpeting> i am okay with having the details at least, but I can see if somebody was already confused about stuff that it wouldn't help

[10:02:48] <ede> > If your download does not start automatically, click debian-11.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso.
[10:03:11] <ede> really, who had the idea? that autodownload crap was annoying on freshmeat already.
[10:03:50] <ede> and those background downloads may have even made sense in the modem era, so they didn't block the browser.
[10:04:05] <at0m> yea. especially with some browsers now already caching before a download location has been specified
[10:04:51] <ede> but that grey DOWNLOAD thing on the startpage is EITHER a button, then it should start the download OR a link and go to the download page
[10:04:58] <at0m> so auto-dl even wastes more even if you'd eventually cancel/abort
[10:05:11] <ede> web design 101: let every element look like what it's supposed to be
[10:05:21] <ede> and this
[10:05:30] <sney> the download button on debian.org already started the download, so this maintained the previous functionality (click download, receive download) while also adding more information that was missing
[10:05:40] <sney> but it is a collaborative process, feel free to submit revisions :)
[10:06:18] <ede> without script blocker it's not even clear what exactly that element is without looking into the sources.
[10:06:33] <sney> it's just a http meta refresh thingy

[10:08:43] <sney> https://salsa.debian.org/webmaster-team/webwml/-/blob/master/english/download.wml
[10:11:02] <ede> interesting. why does it work to keep the browser on /download? is it meant to work like this or just trusting those writing the code?
[10:13:45] <ede> there really should be a link to /distrib/ instead. doesn't make any sense to first start the download and then offer alternatives (yes, technically it's the other way round, but 3s just isn't enough to find and click the link)
[10:14:15] <sney> there is a link to distrib on download, as you can see, but distrib is rather obviously *not* a simple 1 step to get the netinst
[10:15:03] <sney> the goal was to not diminish existing functionality, and also basically mimic what every other distro does, "here is the installer iso that most users want" plus the missing stuff like checksums
[10:15:51] <ede> wah, and just noticed that the context menu in the download thingy doesn't even have a STOP DOWNLOAD entry
[10:16:17] <sney> "stop download" is provided by your browser's cancel button
[10:16:40] <sney> anyway, there have been many other proposals to revamp the debian.org download infrastructure, and they all fall victim to scope creep because people have 100 different things to fix and quibble over
[10:16:53] <sney> this one was simple so it actually got done. and there's the salsa link, if you want to make it better.
[10:17:34] <ede> firefox had at least in the path both options in the same place, a simple text link to "other downloads" or something. though they messed up the css and had JS fix it (well done!), so with noscript that link was hidden below that huge DOWNLOAD image

[10:20:02] <sney> user input in irc channels is mostly yelling into the abyss, this is a support resource, the only reason I even *know* the answer to your web complaint is I was involved with that specific project
[10:20:26] <sney> if you want to provide input that is valued, then participate in mailing lists and so on

[11:03:56] <asarch> Even if, e.g., libgtk2.0-dev:i386?
[11:04:28] <somiaj> you can only have one of libfoo-dev:i386 and libfoo-dev:amd64 installed, so if you install all the headers for 32bit, it will build a 32bit package
[11:04:55] <somiaj> (there is some info on cross compling and a few libaries that you can do this with, but in general debian's libfoo-dev packages are not multiarch, so you can't have more than one arch installed)
[11:05:20] <somiaj> as mentioned I just found building in a 32bit chroot made my life easier on this front

[13:33:14] <Khepra> "action" is fail2ban's config variable.   "action_"  is a random name that could've been "donald_duck". it, however, represents a default action to use, since there's also action_mw and action_mwl. so that you don't have to explicitely define them, you just alter the "action" and set it to action_ or action_mw or action_mwl or write your own
[13:34:43] <Khepra> it's like this.   do_something_a,  do_somethinng_b  and do_something_c   are just variables that hold various action definitions. a b or c.    you set   action = do_something_a   if you want that to be the "action" performed on ban. if oyu want b, you set  action = do_something_b
[13:35:15] <dob1> I have to try, as alwasy thanks for all the infos and the time to explain to me

[13:47:32] <Khepra> huskal: SMART data is often false negative. meaning, absence of reported issues doesn't mean there aren't any. however, based on that Runtime_Bad_Block being nonzero, I'd start looking for a replacement and make sure I had good, data checksummed, backups
[13:48:31] <huskal> Khepra so if it shows nothing wrong, there might still be something wrong. but if it shows something wrong, certainly something is wrong
[13:48:36] <huskal> is that what you mean?
[13:48:37] <Khepra> ideally you look at VALUE column, as that's normalized value in range 0-200. the lower the number, the worse the state of the disk is
[13:48:43] <Khepra> huskal: yes
[13:49:14] <huskal> i usually look at raw column
[13:49:19] <Khepra> there's just minor exceptions here. the VALUE is what the vendor thinks is okay or not. so you can have proliferating bad sectors that have high VALUE (Above THRESH, which is vendor's idea of "uh-oh, this is dying")
[13:49:36] <Khepra> huskal: raw is mostly meaningless, and different from model to model
[13:50:06] <huskal> ok so i look for high values. low values means there is an issue if near threshold
[13:50:14] <Khepra> so the minor exceptions is that the vendor could think lots of bad sectors is still a good thing because there's spare sectors, firmware relocations etc.... but in my experience, once those start appearing, it's bound to be dead "soon"
[13:50:29] <huskal> also i have no reallocated sectors, is the runtime bad block a big problem?

[14:00:45] <huskal> this copies everything under / recursively?
[14:01:12] <Khepra> now that won't include mounted filesystems, like /dev, /proc and /sys which is what you want. If, however, you do have other mounted filesystems and want them included (eg. /boot, or /mnt/games, or whatev), you can run a rsync separately for them, or toy with excludes
[14:01:42] <Khepra> huskal: yes. you can add a -v to see the files, or use  --info=progress2 to observe the overall progress

[14:07:15] <Khepra> ZFS works very damn well. the only problem is it's out of tree which means whatever when you need to rescue it and don't have zfs already installed in the rescue env.
[14:07:46] <Khepra> that problem also affects inability to run bleeding edge kernels without also upgrading ZFS to catch up. but if you rely on Stable, that's almost never an issue
[14:08:17] <Khepra> might be, say, if you want backported kernel. so you'll need backported zfs-dkms. and be careful with that as the kernel _might_ upgrade without zfs catching up.

[14:20:34] <Khepra> yes I do, no it doesn't affect performance at least not visibly or significantly. I run databases on ZFS even. doesn't wear the ssd any more than any other fs either
[14:20:37] <Khepra> !ssd wear
[14:20:37] <dpkg> In 2021 and beyond, you should not worry about wearing out your SSD unless you have a prehistoric SSD. If your use case is writing out hundreds of TB within several years (typical SSD endurance these days), then you likely have the means to use redundant arrays, hot standbys and have ensured data endurance. Therefore, writing out 10TB or 50TB more or less should be irrelevant for you.

[15:38:53] <Khepra> so the question is, how much does your swap write out. If it wrote 1MB/s which is A LOT, constantly writing 1MB every second of every day, comes up to ~31TB per year. 3-4 years to reach 100TBW, but SSDs can typically do more
[15:39:09] <Khepra> so you're far likely to hit the "age" factor, than TBW factor, with modern SSDs.

[15:43:43] <Khepra> unborn: forget about the definition of swapstorm. simply measure out how much you use swap per day, then calculate how that relates to TBW rate of your SSD
[15:43:51] *** Joins: grobi (~grobi@user/grobi)
[15:44:31] <Khepra> swapstorms is indeed a sliding scale. but typically involves constant paging in and out. this could be in KB/s or MB/s, depending on the situation, RAM available, slowness of drives, ...
[15:44:43] *** Quits: fcinq (~irc@46.105.34.51) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[15:45:23] <Khepra> so my point is, that from my experience and measuring dozens of servers and workstations over the years, swap wears out SSD insignificantly, compared to OTHER things. browser for example. those do orders of magnitude more writes than people usually imagine
[15:45:41] <unborn> Khepra: that is satisfying - basically lower input and you will live longer.. sappiness - was the first place we where talking about. Thanks for input and I do appreciate confirmation
[15:46:02] <Khepra> so a blanket statement that swap is bad for SSD is invalid statement. you need to actually measure your own swap use, relative to your RAM size and use, and see how that affects your SSD.
[15:47:30] <unborn> no no swap is great.. i ain't said swap is bad I asked if I can reduce swap to half of my ram which is about 24 gig speaking.. I love swap! never go without some.

[15:47:43] <Khepra> unborn: I have swapiness 10. on some servers it's 0. those servers typically use swap at a rate of less than 1 page per second. taht's less than 4KB per second. that's NOTHING for the hundreds of TBW rated for the SSDs in them.

[15:49:20] <unborn> swap about 4gb.. that should give long time range... me too Khepra

[15:53:05] <Khepra> vm.swappiness is a unit-less heuristic number ranging from 0-200 (0-100 on pre-5.10 kernels). the greater the number, the greater the probability that kernel will page out INACTIVE memory. that's all. it's the same for 1GB or 100GB swap sizes. what wears out SSDs is TBW per given time frame. question is only if you hit rated TBW sooner than rated age.
[15:53:14] <unborn> Khepra: I know.. main point is not to fight, my main point was use less happinesses with more ram like 24gb+ (perhaps my English - Im sorry for that) so 10 or lower at this specs should be fine?

[15:54:27] <unborn> swappiness not happiness omg!
[15:54:32] <Khepra> "fine" depends on what you want. lower the number means the kernel will page out only when it really needs. value of 0 means the absolute maximum kernel can tolerate before paging out (like, swappiness of 0 doesn't mean it won't even swap out)
[15:54:45] *** Quits: diiirt (~diiirt@user/diiirt) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[15:54:46] *** diiirt0 is now known as diiirt
[15:55:36] <Khepra> so MY heuristic is this. more swap space you got, more chance you'll shoot yourself in the foot. so I want swapping at minimum only when it's REALLY required, so I keep it low. 0-10, for 4096MiB swap size. that's enough to satisfiy transient edge cases.
[15:56:32] <unborn> Khepra: your proposal sounds great.. I will need few days to test it out.. I need like 100k connections to my server at the same time and moment.. but I think more swap on my ssd is more like it to die sooner.
[15:57:02] <Khepra> 4GB is a lot. that's 4 seconds to fill out at 1GB/s. 8 seconds for typical SATA SSDs. 40 seconds for typical SATA HDDs. imagine what that does then, if your kernel needs to fill it up because it's out of RAM. your system grinds to a virtual halt, waiting long time for paging in and out to complete
[15:57:56] <unborn> Khepra: - your answer is - understood and well received. (24Gib of ram) I would like to thank you once again!

[15:58:31] <Khepra> so some people say they want larger swap, thinking that will buy them nonexistent RAM. Man, if your kernel paged out 32GiB of memory because you have only 16GiB but your app wanted much more..... imagine what will happen if the kernel needed to page that back in. you can go grab a cup of coffee before the computer becomes responsive again, if at all :)
[15:59:23] <Khepra> so my advice, unless you need it for hibernation, keep swap small. 2-4 GB. and if you _think_ you need more, then you should buy more RAM instead.

[17:02:00] <unborn> XileX: I use debian from 2000... try me out..
[17:02:06] <unborn> pls
[17:03:09] <XileX> unborn: Package manager keeps a list of installed programs and autoremove removes the packages that are not required by package managers list anymore
[17:03:15] <unborn> XileX: are you l403  fella here? ??
[17:03:20] <l403> On Gentoo, there is file called @world which keeps list of things user has requested to be installed. if you install a package and not add it to this file, the package is installed but it does not satisfy dependency of any other package and is not in the file of packages requested by user (the @world file) so it can be safely removed on cleanup
[17:03:29] <pert> apologies, I'm just now joining so I don't have the full context, but perhaps you're looking for apt's --mark-auto option, which atomically installs a package and marks it as automatically installed?
[17:04:54] <l403> I am just drawing a parallel on gentoo and alpine so I can describe why such thing might be useful. I am not familiar with deb at all
[17:05:00] <XileX> --mark-auto might be what we wanted in this case. Thanks pert

[17:24:58] <n4dir> l403: usually you would build packages in a chroot, say with pbuilder.
[17:25:45] <pokota> I think I asked this before and abruptly left before I could get an answer, but using ffprobe on bookworm leads to "libdav1d.so.4: no such file or directory." Should I file a bug report, and if so against which package?
[17:26:28] <Khepra> pokota:   apt-file search libdav1d.so.4
[17:28:01] <pokota> it's probably a stable/testing mismatch since stable has libdav1d4 and testing has libdav1d5
[17:28:22] <pokota> but ffmpeg in testing is still looking for libdav1d4?
[17:29:10] <pokota> I guess that means I should file the bug report against the ffmpeg repository, then
[17:30:10] <Khepra> pokota: sems like libdav1d-dev is a build-time dependency only for ffmpeg
[17:30:26] <pokota> hm
[17:30:35] <pokota> aha, there's the problem
[17:31:28] <pokota> not a bug, it was on my end - I had copied my home folder from a machine with a custom ffmpeg, but forgot I had done that
