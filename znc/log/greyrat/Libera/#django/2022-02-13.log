[04:50:54] <orzel> nbjoerg: thx ! I expected something simpler, but that will do :-)
[04:51:40] <orzel> I have a (generic) function that can act on different such fields, and I dont want to give the upload_to path each time. (because of DRY principle :-)

[21:54:34] <theprophet> hi am reading django documentation once again, and i am at the template part and it says this ---> If you want to change the URL of the polls detail view to something else, perhaps to something like polls/specifics/12/ instead of doing it in the template (or templates) you would change it in polls/urls.py:
[21:54:46] <theprophet> what i dont get it is, how do you change the name in templates?
[21:54:58] <theprophet> i mean url name*
[21:55:55] <theprophet> i mean, i know how to do that in views, but since it says instead of template, i was wondering , how its done?
[21:56:05] <spacexdragon> I have a Course model, a Book model and a Discount model. I would like to design a monthly Bill model. The bill should store multiple courses, books and discounts because bill=(course1+course2+...+coursen+book1+book2+...+bookn-discount1-discount2-...-discountn). What is the best way to design this kind of relation?
[21:59:22] <doismellburning> theprophet: what exactly do you mean?
[21:59:39] <doismellburning> theprophet: if you actually mean "url name" then you'd change it in both
[22:00:05] <doismellburning> theprophet: in general the principle is that you don't refer to exact URLs in templates, you use the {%url%} tag and refer to them by name
[22:00:19] <doismellburning> so if you want to change the URL structure, your templates don't need to know or care
[22:00:27] <theprophet> i know that, yes , but may i know, how exactly you can do that in templates?
[22:00:28] <doismellburning> but if you change the URL name, they do, since that's what they use
[22:00:33] <doismellburning> theprophet: do what?
[22:00:43] <theprophet> to change the name of the url in templates
[22:00:51] *** Quits: spacexdragon (~spacexdra@222.112.61.219) (Quit: Client closed)
[22:00:58] <theprophet> i am interested since it said 'instead of template'
[22:01:20] *** Joins: spacexdragon (~spacexdra@1.224.172.98)
[22:01:30] <doismellburning> theprophet: by "instead of doing it in the template" I think you'll find it means "because you've referred to your URLs by name" as I described
[22:01:33] <theprophet> since it is possible, i wanna know that how its done.
[22:02:44] *** Quits: magga (magga@ti0036a400-3577.bb.online.no) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:02:58] <doismellburning> theprophet: hard-code your URLs
[22:03:17] <doismellburning> (but, like, don't do that, you're ditching semantic validation etc.
[22:03:18] <doismellburning> )
[22:03:27] <theprophet> so that instead, means when its hardcoded?
[22:03:39] <doismellburning> theprophet: yes
[22:03:54] <theprophet> <li><a href="/polls/{{ question.id }}/">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>
[22:04:09] <theprophet> so this is hardcoded, and where is instead here? can you point at it?
[22:04:20] <doismellburning> theprophet: there is no "instead" there
[22:04:54] *** Quits: gopar (~gopar@c-67-164-79-22.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) ()
[22:04:54] <doismellburning> theprophet: I don't have the tutorial open, but the "right" way would look like `href="{% url poll_detail id=question.id %}"` or similar
[22:05:10] <doismellburning> no hardcoded URL structure etc.
[22:05:11] <theprophet> you mean poll:url?
[22:05:29] <theprophet> 'poll:url'
[22:05:39] <doismellburning> plausibly, I'm writing code from memory here
[22:05:45] <theprophet> hold
[22:05:52] <theprophet> poll_detail is wrong
[22:05:59] <theprophet> do you mean
[22:06:03] <theprophet> poll:detail?
[22:06:06] <doismellburning> again
[22:06:14] <doismellburning> would look *like*
[22:06:21] <doismellburning> the point of my example is the use of the url tag
[22:06:38] <doismellburning> I do not remember exactly what the modern tutorial is using as the view name
[22:07:09] <doismellburning> and I believe the tutorial gives an exact example
[22:07:34] <theprophet> look at this please, its a screenshot
[22:07:36] <theprophet> https://ibb.co/LN5fRtv
[22:08:59] <theprophet> so it says instead of chaning the url name in templates,  you can do it in views.
[22:09:04] <theprophet> changing*
[22:09:13] <theprophet> i understand the part of it
[22:10:20] <doismellburning> ah, so my example was almost exactly like the second code sample there
[22:10:32] <theprophet> i go and change it in views, and i get the expected result but , for me it sounds like getting this expected result, not only can be done by changing the url name but also in templates, somehow.
[22:11:12] <doismellburning> Well yes, if you weren't using the url tag, if you changed the URL structure, you'd have to modify the template
[22:11:44] <doismellburning> Using the url tag means you can just change the structure and your templates don't care
[22:15:14] <doismellburning> "instead of [if you were hardcoding URLs as initially demonstrated, when you would have to also change] the template"
[22:17:38] <theprophet> i just did some small reasearch just now
[22:18:34] <theprophet> ok i know it makes sense to you, and its something easy, but for me its not
[22:18:42] <theprophet> ill get there but still
[22:19:29] <doismellburning> I appreciate that, but I'm still not clear about your actual question/issue

[22:24:21] <theprophet> doismellburning well, i wanna exactly know, what is meant by 'instead' like , chronologicly want to know that.
[22:24:49] <doismellburning> theprophet: instead of the style immediately before / at the start of the section you showed
[22:24:52] <theprophet> what is meant there. whats the idea, if its not directly changing url name in templates, wth it says that?
[22:24:57] <theprophet> why confuse people
[22:25:06] <doismellburning> theprophet: I don't think it generally confuses people
[22:25:46] <doismellburning> I mean no slight by that, but I think the "instead" part is generally understood, which is why I'm trying to better understand what trouble you're running into here
[22:26:06] <theprophet> doismellburning ------ > something like polls/specifics/12/ instead of doing it in the template
[22:26:16] <theprophet> doing what it templates?
[22:26:36] <theprophet> to change the url name right?
[22:26:54] <doismellburning> It starts off demonstrating the hardcoded-URL technique, then it shows you how to not do that, then it says "hey, this is great because if you didn't do this, and changed your URL pattern, you'd have to change your templates, instead you can just change it in one place"
[22:29:11] <doismellburning> "if you didn't follow the advice here about a better way, and use the URL tag, instead you'd have to change all your templates if you change the URL pattern"
[22:30:00] <doismellburning> (And hopefully it's clear why that isn't great?)
[22:30:20] <theprophet> hm
[22:30:35] <theprophet> i understand why its better
[22:32:00] <doismellburning> Excellent
[22:32:33] <theprophet> thanks, still little bit unclear but thanks

[23:58:03] <dang`r`us> flaf, no worries, it doesn't do anything in any IRC client I'm aware of

[23:58:48] <dang`r`us> apology appreciated nonetheless :)
