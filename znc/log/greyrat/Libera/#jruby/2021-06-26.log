[05:55:17] <RobertNicholas[m> is there a good way I can add gems in with jruby when it's compiled? in my build.gradle I have:
[05:55:17] <RobertNicholas[m> compile files("libs/jruby-complete-9.2.jar") which paths to jruby but I need to be able to include the zip gem with jruby as a requirement and don't wanna make users download it or have to include it separately
