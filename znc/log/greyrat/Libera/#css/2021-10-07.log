[13:42:36] *** Quits: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[13:48:32] <fweht> as far as i understood, the reason to use rem instead of px is accesibility, so that users can zoom into pages, as the zoom command changes the base font size.  but when i zoom, also px-sized elements scale up.  so is this information still accurate?
[13:49:35] <fweht> jokoon: did you try `position: fixed`?  would be also my first choice, but i don't know the specifics of your website...
[13:50:41] <oksushi> fweht: the reason to use rem is because you want to use a relative unit that reflects the user’s choice
[13:51:13] <fweht> oksushi: ah, so its not about zoom but also about the browser preferences, that makes sense, thank you!
[13:51:20] <oksushi> users can adjust the “base” font-size in their browser

[14:08:12] <Horacsio> Can you send a link?
[14:08:26] <Horacsio> have you tried flexbox already?
[14:15:01] <TheDcoder[m]> No unfortunately
[14:15:10] <TheDcoder[m]> I have to use a table because that is what the client wants
[14:15:23] <TheDcoder[m]> It's a vertical table too
[14:15:26] *** Joins: stenno (~stenno@user/stenno)
[14:15:50] <TheDcoder[m]> Sorry, I mean horizontal
[14:17:23] <hmw[at]> TheDcoder[m]: You can't do that with table layout. You can remove the table properties from the <table> tag (display:somethingelse) and make table, tr, td etc. behave like a css grid or use flex on them.
[14:17:55] <jokoon> fweht, yes I did, but I now want to center the image
[14:18:07] <TheDcoder[m]> hmw[at]: I see... I will try using another display type, thanks.

[14:27:49] <TheDcoder[m]> It doesn't work very well for some reason
[14:28:21] <TheDcoder[m]> I managed to abstract away the table, how do I share my HTML?
[14:28:45] <TheDcoder[m]> I'd paste at a normal pastebin but maybe there are better options for web dev.
[14:30:50] <hmw[at]> jsfiddle works without login
[14:31:04] <hmw[at]> https://jsfiddle.net/ TheDcoder[m]
[14:32:12] <hmw[at]> TheDcoder[m]: Using a text paste isn't very useful. When we can use the browser's inspector tools to look at code, it makes us 100 times faster. Most people will not even try to read code on a text paste, that is more than 3 lines. If they even look.
[14:32:55] <TheDcoder[m]> Yes I understand, that's why I asked for recommendations, will try jsfiddle
[14:33:23] <TheDcoder[m]> https://jsfiddle.net/9L7wbvgy/
[14:33:56] <TheDcoder[m]> It doesn't look right because I am also using bootstrap
[14:34:11] <hmw[at]> You can include that. Let me see, if I can "update" your fiddle
[14:35:35] <TheDcoder[m]> Thanks :)
[14:36:16] <TheDcoder[m]> There was another service called html.house but they had to disable new submissions because of the phishing pages getting posted there.
[14:36:33] <hmw[at]> TheDcoder[m]: I added it https://jsfiddle.net/x2wek91o/ But only the font changed. Did I do it wrong? Check the "Ressources" thing on the left
[14:38:23] <hmw[at]> TheDcoder[m]: I am usually not using frameworks, so take my responses with a grain of salt. Do you _have_ to do it with bootstrap classes, or would you accept a "pure CSS" solution?
[14:38:40] <hmw[at]> Guess I can cobble it together from scratch in a few minutes
[14:39:16] <TheDcoder[m]> I fixed it, you used a way newer version so it didn't work :) https://jsfiddle.net/jp3gdeLb/
[14:39:55] <TheDcoder[m]> Bootstrap is just for convenience, and it is also part of the project I am working on. You can give me a vanilla solution and I can adapt it
[14:39:56] <hmw[at]> ah
[14:40:23] <hmw[at]> ok, let me see if I can do it. Grid probably not the right tool here and my flex-foo is a little weak
[14:41:44] <hmw[at]> TheDcoder[m]: Your example isn't very wide. Did I understand this correctly: You want a table that has some cells with lots of text, and you don't want line wrapping, but instead have the whole table be larger than the viewport (as in scrollbars appear)?
[14:42:33] <TheDcoder[m]> my end goal is actually splitting the bottom two rows into multiple columns, the top row needs to be a single cell (not counting the "heading" cell)
[14:43:00] <TheDcoder[m]> hmw[at]: The divs inside the cell need to be horizontal without wrapping, that's the goal.
[14:43:40] <hmw[at]> That will only be possible, if you accept the table to grow larger than the VP
[14:44:28] <TheDcoder[m]> Yes, that's okay, part of the goal is to have a scroll bar if things don't fit in the parent container
[14:46:02] <TheDcoder[m]> the current html wraps the '.col-md-1' cells, I want it to overflow the table instead.
[14:49:19] <hmw[at]> TheDcoder[m]: I am struggling a little bit here, it might take a while. Meanwhile, you can check out https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43115822/can-i-make-a-css-grid-with-dynamic-number-of-rows-or-columns
[14:49:35] <hmw[at]> (Guess I got rusty in the last 5 months of not doing any CSS :-)
[14:50:13] <TheDcoder[m]> Thanks, I have been struggling with it for quite a few hours too. I will check out the SO answer
[14:53:02] <Horacsio> you know TheDcoder[m] I just picked your question and googled it? :D like this: "make a table overflow horizontally"
[14:53:32] <TheDcoder[m]> Horacsio: Yes, I did that too but the results didn't come quite right like I mentioned.
[14:53:59] <hmw[at]> I must be missing something. https://jsfiddle.net/x2wek91o/2/ does seem to behave as required

[15:02:04] <hmw[at]> TheDcoder[m]: I see no reason why those divs should behave like inline blocks or float-lefts. What does your inspector reveal, when you check where it comes from?

[15:04:17] <TheDcoder[m]> Hmmm... not sure what you mean, the inspector doesn't show anything special. I think the inline block behavior comes from bootstrap, I am using their special column class
[15:04:36] <TheDcoder[m]> float: left; actually :)
[15:04:54] <hmw[at]> Checking. Why don't _I_ see it tho
[15:05:13] <TheDcoder[m]> what version of bootstrap are you using?
[15:05:31] <hmw[at]> no idea :)
[15:05:32] <TheDcoder[m]> this is the correct one: https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css
[15:05:37] <hmw[at]> https://jsfiddle.net/x2wek91o/2/
[15:05:49] <hmw[at]> We can force jsfiddle to use your link.
[15:06:23] <hmw[at]> ah now I see the issue, but I need to make the window rather wide
[15:06:33] <TheDcoder[m]> just checked your fiddle, it's using the 5.5 version, which is a lot newer
[15:06:43] <hmw[at]> TheDcoder[m]: https://jsfiddle.net/nskwcyhv/ <-- with YOUR css url
[15:07:22] <TheDcoder[m]> yes, works as expected now if I make the vp extra wide
[15:07:38] <TheDcoder[m]> now we need to get the table to overflow
[15:07:39] <hmw[at]> TheDcoder[m]: I see several options. You can use different bootstrap classes, roll your own CSS using what you got as a template (and remove the fluid layout stuff), or use CSS specificity to overwrite whatever needs removing
[15:08:01] <hmw[at]> It does overflow nicely, when I make the window narrow, so there is already a working solutin in there somewhere
[15:08:28] <hmw[at]> *does not overflow, actually heheh
[15:08:56] <TheDcoder[m]> I am open to a no bootstrap solution
[15:09:13] <TheDcoder[m]> perhaps CSS grids are the best thing in this case?
[15:09:59] <hmw[at]> TheDcoder[m]: Without the col-md-1 classes, it seems to work now: https://jsfiddle.net/nskwcyhv/1/
[15:10:26] <hmw[at]> oh. THere is an ellipsis somewhere
[15:12:14] <TheDcoder[m]> yes! it has certainly improved
[15:12:42] <TheDcoder[m]> I had to add display: inline-block; to the new class to make them appear on the same line
[15:13:24] <hmw[at]> Oh, you want the divs inline block... ic
[15:14:29] <TheDcoder[m]> yeah, should've said it better... want it overflowing in the x axis
[15:15:24] <hmw[at]> I think, that's not overflowing tho
[15:15:35] <hmw[at]> just inlining
[15:16:21] <hmw[at]> waah where does the ellipsis in "Foo2 has ..." come from? How do I search the current DOM for CSS rules. Arghl.
[15:16:34] <TheDcoder[m]> I also don't want them to wrap, i.e take up more than one line, hence the overflow part :)
[15:17:21] <TheDcoder[m]> you can use the "computed" tab to attempt why the width is limited for that element
[15:17:31] <TheDcoder[m]> *attempt to see why
[15:17:54] <TheDcoder[m]> It shows all computed properties for an element... it's not easy to use but it works.
[15:18:29] <hmw[at]> Wait. I wasn't looking right. There is no ellipsis after all
[15:18:43] <hmw[at]> TheDcoder[m]: Are you good to finalize it on your own now?
[15:19:12] <TheDcoder[m]> Maybe, but thanks for your help!
[15:19:44] <hmw[at]> From here it looks mostly solved. Ask again, if you want more help.
[15:20:21] <TheDcoder[m]> will do. also realized that the 'ellipsis' is just two adjacent full stops, lol
[15:20:36] <hmw[at]> yeah :)

[22:00:40] <lmat> How do I add a border-radius: 1em; to a grid row? Should I be using <table>?
[22:01:00] <lmat> I have a display: grid; grid-template-columns: 20% 40% 20% 20%;  and a slew of divs that form a table with four columns.
[22:03:25] <lmat> I would like to do other things to rows... for instance: text-transform: uppercase; the first row (all four divs in the first row)
[22:03:27] <hmw[at]> lmat: certainly not use <table> for layout. If anything, display:table would be acceptable (not a real suggestion as solution to your question, though)
[22:04:16] <lmat> In the general case, is there any way to select a row or column and apply styles to it as a whole?
[22:04:40] <hmw[at]> With grid, that may be tricky. Hmm...
[22:04:58] <lmat> If there's a better way, I'm all ears.
[22:05:00] <hmw[at]> Thing is, you can move around grid cells freely. There is no way to select for the apparent order
[22:05:25] <lmat> I really am making a table with a header row, and several rows of data. Changing their order would be unacceptable.
[22:05:33] <hmw[at]> You can select the 1st, 2nd, etc. element within your grid though, and do it this way.
[22:06:06] <hmw[at]> Wait, if you are presenting actual _tabular_data_, use <table>. You might assign display:grid to it, should you not want the default table behaviour
[22:06:26] <Rockwood> https://jsfiddle.net/xwpqjk4s/ i wanna print last child too when my mouse
[22:06:46] <hmw[at]> Not sure, how grid works with border radius tho. I am trying stuff now in a fiddle, I might come up with something
[22:06:46] <Rockwood> on mouse hover
[22:07:23] <hmw[at]> darn, what is the bot code in this channel
[22:07:24] <lmat> hmw[at]: <table> okay.
[22:08:03] <hmw[at]> lmat: Thing is, we separate content from layout. HTML is for content. You ideally ignore visual presentation completely, when writing it. Once the HTML is written, the CSS expert applies styles to it.

[22:17:03] <lmat> hmw[at]: Thank you!
[22:17:23] <lmat> When I change "td" in CSS to "tr", the border goes away.
[22:17:47] <lmat> "How do I add a border-radius: 1em; to a grid row? Should I be using <table>?"  I'm wanting the whole row to have some style.
[22:18:36] <hmw[at]> ah
[22:19:50] <hmw[at]> That's not possible with simple rules, might require some wizardry
[22:21:22] <lmat> What do you recommend to make one of these? https://imgur.com/1ywQgJ6.png
[22:22:00] <hmw[at]> I would probably assign a different display property to the <table> and do it "normally"
[22:22:06] <lmat> I am leaning toward grid and table so that the column widths match up.
[22:22:47] <hmw[at]> Some trickery with ::before and ::after pseudo-elements, I guess
[22:23:04] <hmw[at]> involves absolute positioning of those usually
[22:24:27] <lmat> I mean, it would work if I made several four-column grids, but that seems ghetto. What you're suggesting sounds worse to me :-D
[22:25:20] <lmat> https://jsfiddle.net/gzt9fw18/ Is obviously not right.
[22:27:58] <hmw[at]> lmat: https://jsfiddle.net/08vg1wra/ something like this

[22:31:51] <hassoon> we have the grid layout system for that

[22:32:26] <hmw[at]> lmat: https://jsfiddle.net/08vg1wra/1/ <-- not cleaned up, but seems a viable way
[22:33:00] <hassoon> rounded backgrounds ?
[22:33:03] <hmw[at]> hassoon: I'd be curious about a better solution though
[22:33:10] <hassoon> they can just have round borders for the rows
[22:33:14] <hmw[at]> each row a background/border with border-radius
[22:33:26] <hmw[at]> well. You can't apply border to display:table-row
[22:33:46] <hassoon> they can deal with the cells
[22:34:28] <hmw[at]> hmm
[22:34:47] <hassoon> lmat: do you have a starting fiddle ?
[22:34:49] <hmw[at]> You can assign the border-radius to columns of the first row, but not to the last in a general way
