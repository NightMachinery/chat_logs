[00:00:26] <OnlineCop> cko: Does Lua allow a string to terminate before a literal newline character as long as the last character is an escape `\` character? Languages like C often allow it: `#define foo(x) \[newline]...continued here...\[newline]...and here`
[00:01:57] <cko> Lua has long strings with look like this `[=[

[00:03:21] <OnlineCop> IRC really kills multiple lines and pastes. 
[00:03:46] <OnlineCop> I'm not talking about long lines, though. I mean actual double-quoted strings.
[00:04:34] <OnlineCop> C would allow something like: `string foo = "line 1 here\[literal newline]line 2 here";` since the `\` is immediately before a literal newline character.
[00:05:25] <OnlineCop> I guess my #define... example above was a bad one, since I actually meant to show a double-quoted string example...

[01:50:35] <jks> Actually im trying this on unrealircd spamfilter feature
[01:50:38] <OnlineCop> Since `\w` is [a-zA-Z0-9_] and `\W` is [^a-zA-Z0-9_], you can use a double-negative so you can add additional characters to the character group: `[^\W_-]` to essentially exclude the '_' character from \w: [a-zA-Z0-9]
[01:51:14] <jks> The concept is like that: /spamfilter add u zline +24h bots ^(.+![\w-]*[-_][\w-]*@.+:.+)$
[01:51:26] <jks> i guess im missing something

[01:52:08] <OnlineCop> My IRC client is messing up what you typed. Could you wrap it in `backticks`?
[01:52:29] <OnlineCop> Don't forget quantifiers around the [...] groups.

[01:52:49] <jks> im gonna use it in the ident
[01:53:19] <jks> ^(.+![\w-]*[-_][\w-]*@.+:.+)$ does not match
[01:53:47] <OnlineCop> My IRC client is trying to Markdown-print what you typed before. If you wrap it in backticks, it won't Markdown-format it. This is what I see: `^(.+![\w-][-_][\w-]@.+:.+)$`
[01:53:56] <OnlineCop> Which I assume is missing some `*` quantifiers.
[01:54:41] <jks> What you see is correct
[01:54:55] <jks> Oh wait its not
[01:55:06] <OnlineCop> I'd replace the `.+!` at the front with a minimal/lazy quantifier, if it supports it: `.+?!` or even `[^!]*!`
[01:57:24] <OnlineCop> Unless this nick!ident occurs somewhere in the middle of the text...

[02:07:42] <OnlineCop> If your mirc regex supports lazy quantifiers, I'd definitely suggest that they would be faster.
[02:08:08] <OnlineCop> `.+!.+@.+:(?-i)[^\W_-]*[-_][\w-]*$` => `.+?!.+?@.+?:(?-i)[^\W_-]*[-_][\w-]*$`
[02:09:08] <jks> Ok let me try
[02:10:25] <OnlineCop> Even faster, if you know for certain that '!' and '@' and ':' won't occur before it: `[^!]*![^@]*@[^:]*:(?-i)([^\W_-]*[-_][\w-]*)$`

[14:14:23] <mysticspiral[m]> note that the m flag is important here
[14:15:59] <MaxE> This works perfectly at regex101. Unfortunately, on Advanced Renamer. Only last white space lefts.
[14:17:37] <MaxE> with g flag is important to clean properly until latest white space.

[17:17:34] <digitok> . matches any character except \n
[17:17:35] <re101-koala-83> If I try it on Regex101 for example I only get the first hit
[17:17:40] <digitok> so .* matches to the end of a line
[17:17:56] <digitok> 07re101-koala-83, be sure you have the /g flag enabled
[17:18:14] <gregu-> ahh that would explain, thank you digitok 
[17:18:16] <digitok> in python, you do not use the // delimiters
[17:18:20] <digitok> np
[17:19:04] <re101-koala-83> How do I enable the /g flag in Python if I may ask?
[17:19:11] <digitok> also fwiw, you do not need the ignorecase flag for this one
[17:19:35] <digitok> you would use .findall
[17:19:43] <re101-koala-83> It's part of my assignment, I can't change the code (so the ignorecase needs to stay), so I may only give a pattern as input
[17:19:51] <re101-koala-83> Regex pattern
[17:19:59] <re101-koala-83> Its this basically:
[17:20:00] <re101-koala-83> # YOUR CODE HERE
[17:20:01] <re101-koala-83> pattern = ": (.*)"
[17:20:01] <re101-koala-83> # YOUR CODE ENDS HERE

[20:14:28] <rewt> ^ that's why... ". match EoL" means . will match end-of-line characters (CR & LF)
[20:15:04] <DynV> the 1st case works fine
[20:15:12] <DynV> what's the difference?
[20:15:40] <rewt> is there any eol between \[download\] and the very next eol?
[20:16:54] <DynV> see video 3 for the 1st case, and video 1 for the 2nd.
[20:18:39] <rewt> x(.*?)\R means match x and everything up to the next eol... so it doesn't matter if . will match eol or not, it will stop at the next eol either way
[20:20:00] <rewt> x(.*)y\R means match x and everything up to y... so if there is an eol between them it will match if ". match EoL" is enabled
[20:20:10] <rewt> x(.*?)y\R too
[20:21:14] <rewt> if you don't want . to match eol, don't enable the ". matches eol" option...
[20:21:18] <DynV> but case 2 is on a single line.
[20:22:30] <DynV> isn't . match EoL mandatory for a multi-line regex on N++?
[20:23:05] <rewt> look for the very first "\[download\]" in that text (ignoring everything after it)... then from there, find the very next "has already been downloaded"... everything between them is part of that match
[20:23:23] <rewt> . match EoL is only mandatory if you want . to match EoL...

[21:46:10] <Ryex> example match (keyword/s - google search) but not match 'google search' title?
[21:48:07] <OnlineCop> Ryex: Do you want "^google search [more text]" or "[text] google search$" to match (beginning and end of line), as long as it's not the only thing on the line?
[21:49:01] <OnlineCop> Ryex: Which flavor/engine are you using? PCRE, Javascript, etc. (vscode: Javascript, Notepad++: PCRE, Visual Studio: .NET, etc.)
[21:49:45] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/D9fTO5/2
[21:50:11] <OnlineCop> Otherwise: https://regex101.com/r/D9fTO5/3
[21:50:13] <Ryex> just match the beginning and end of line making sure not to match google search
[21:50:20] <Ryex> let me check
[21:50:21] <Ryex> Thanks!
[21:50:59] <OnlineCop> Sadly, you have to repeat the text you're searching for.
[21:51:58] <OnlineCop> If you did something like https://regex101.com/r/D9fTO5/4 then only "google search" that isn't at the beginning/end of a line will match.
[21:53:45] <Ryex> I'm using an app to block siteswhich is able to use regex on the blocklist. Would like to block any keyword search ex. spot - google search but not block when opening only 'google search' page as title
[21:55:53] <OnlineCop> Do versions /2, /3 or /4 meet your requirements?
[21:56:48] <Ryex> I mean to match this one ( "[text] google search$" to match (beginning and end of line), as long as it's not the only thing on the line)
[21:57:27] <OnlineCop> Version /3 ?
[21:57:48] <Ryex> How to set regex for this, where 'text' could be any keyword (ex. boy - google search or girl - google search) and not match just 'google search' in the line
[21:57:58] <OnlineCop> Line 1, "google search", doesn't match. "[text]google search", "google search[text]" and "[text]google search[text]" all match.
[21:59:15] <OnlineCop> Ryex: Open https://regex101.com/r/D9fTO5/3, then add all the sample lines you'd like to test ("should match", "should not match", etc.) then click "update regex" in the top-left.
[21:59:39] <Ryex> If possible the opposite of version 3 where it matches any keyword search from google (where google is the last line)
[22:00:40] <OnlineCop> Okay, so you want to match all the text in a line, but exclude "google search" itself?
[22:01:37] <Ryex> yes match all text along with google search but not match just google search
[22:02:02] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/D9fTO5/5 will capture both "before" and "after" text.
[22:02:13] <OnlineCop> It requires that "google search" be somewhere on the line.
[22:03:10] <Ryex> PERFECT! That's it! Thanks OnlineCop
[22:03:44] <OnlineCop> https://regex101.com/r/D9fTO5/6 just for fun (gets rid of some of the surrounding whitespace).
[22:04:22] <Ryex> haha got it. Thanks a bunch! Cheers!
[22:04:45] <OnlineCop> o/
[22:04:46] <Ryex> by the way will this work for single and double keywords?
[22:05:09] <OnlineCop> I'm not sure what you mean. Toss some of those examples onto the page and see if they match like you expect.

[22:05:27] <OnlineCop> If not, update the regex with those examples and post the updated link here so we can see the problem.
[22:05:54] <Ryex> example 'sports unlimited'
[22:06:28] <Ryex> noted on that. Thanks again! :-)
[22:07:17] <OnlineCop> My pleasure.

[22:32:47] <dandyn> this doesn't work if {[regexp {($crap_titles)|(^\d{1,3}\.\s)} $incoming_title]} {dothis}
[22:37:25] <OnlineCop> What language is this?
[22:38:26] <OnlineCop> Looks like it's looking either for whatever `$crap_titles` evaluates out to OR 1-3 digits followed by '.' and some kind of whitespace.
[22:40:54] <dandyn> yes.. that part works
[22:41:03] <dandyn> it's the combination
[22:41:16] <dandyn> http://paste.tclhelp.net/?id=6raj
[22:41:19] <OnlineCop> Perl? Javascript? R? Lua? I don't recognize the language.
[22:42:09] <OnlineCop> Tcl?
[22:44:08] <dandyn> tcl
[22:44:17] <OnlineCop> https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tcl-tk/tcl_regular_expressions.htm says you need two output variables to put those into.
[22:44:43] <rewt> dandyn, What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Is it unemployed?  What did you expect to happen?
[22:44:52] <OnlineCop> regexp optionalSwitches patterns searchString fullMatch subMatch1 ... subMatchn
[22:45:34] <OnlineCop> `regexp {($crap_titles)|(^\d{1,3}\.\s)} $incoming_title capture1 capture2`
[22:46:36] <OnlineCop> Unless `$crap_titles` is supposed to be the text you're searching through and you want to store its results out to `incoming_title`.
[22:47:43] <OnlineCop> I also think this line has parens and double quotes in the wrong order (I could be wrong): `set crap_titles "([join $::rss_ignored_titles ")|("])"`
[22:48:07] *** Joins: lavaball (felix@31.204.155.215)
[22:50:11] <dandyn> this works: if {[regexp $crap_titles $incoming_title]} {       and this works   if {[regexp {^\d{1,3}\.\s} $incoming_title]} {
[22:50:16] <dandyn> but not combined
[22:50:48] <OnlineCop> When you have capture groups, it needs to store the results out to a variable.
[22:51:03] <rewt> do you need the capture gropus?
[22:51:12] <OnlineCop> Disclaimer: I have no Tcl experience; this is just what I was seeing from the documentation page.

[22:56:30] <dandyn> I dunno man, I try to catch "?" "yy" "��" "aa" "ii"   and lines staring with number and dot like this "232." "1." etc
[23:03:35] <OnlineCop> Is this supposed to be the value of `crap_titles: '(?)|(yy)|(��)|(aa)|(ii)'` ?
[23:03:50] <OnlineCop> I wonder if all those capture groups are messing with it?
