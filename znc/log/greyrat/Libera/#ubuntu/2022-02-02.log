[00:09:57] <leftyfb> anddam: but only for applications that support it

[07:06:30] <BredaSimonides> If I don't want to double transfer files I have to set a flag. If I want to check if the already existing file is not completed yet I have to enable checksum verification which makes it very slow on a lot of files. I think I'm already using like 7 flags and it still not does a simple job of copying files betwen devices. Issue is that I have roughly

[20:14:51] <zer0fun> Traffic goes through by ip just fine.  The way it is supposed to work from what I can find is that network-manager is supposed to add the search domain and the resolv.conf and for some reason that doesn't happen.  I have tried on a clean install.

[23:23:13] <sarnold> knaccc: basically every kernel update comes with security fixes; we might have *one* a year that doesn't include any security fixes, it's pretty weird when they happen..
