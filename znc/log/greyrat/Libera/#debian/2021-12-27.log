[02:54:30] <cdhowie> but the .d approach is the safest in terms of handling upgrades
[02:58:54] <jhutchins> cdhowie: So how does a package that has dropped a file in a .d folder handle upgrades that change the file?
[02:59:40] <cdhowie> to be fair, what i meant was creating a file per interface, which is usually what you do with a .d folder (one file per "configured entity")
[03:00:18] <cdhowie> if the package is dumping files into the .d directory then you have the same issue, which is why i prefer packages that only do so with example files that i can ignore

[14:21:37] <Khepra> I really wonder what's with this push to go wayland by default, among distros. What programs actually support wayland protocol? DE/WM itself, okay. A terminal, okay. Is this it? Firefox is glitchy crap under wayland. I thought latest FF would fix teh bugs, but no dice.
[14:22:37] <Khepra> and xwayland is sprung out of xorg codebase, thus vulnerable to all teh xorg bugs, recent ones included.
[14:23:02] <Khepra> so my support question is: what actually works with wayland in debian, other than a DE or WM here or there, and a terminal here or there, and glitch fox?

[14:40:45] <randall> enoq: No, as that's not supported. Personally, I've never had breaking issues with Debian on upgrade. Just read the release notes, create backups, and follow the upgrade instructions.

[14:42:24] <enoq> Khepra: yep, same here
[14:42:39] <randall> I'd do the same for work, but for home I just upgrade as that's less work for me.
[14:42:47] <enoq> it's a home server yes
[14:42:51] <Khepra> right now, we have a major holdup in the "upgrade" procedure as our flagship python app does NOT support python 3.9. technically, the deps we use do not, and need upgrades too which is a months long testing procedure.....
[14:43:03] <enoq> before the centos debacle I actually contemplated switching
[14:43:11] <Khepra> heh same
[14:43:11] <enoq> since centos releases less frequently
[14:43:17] <randall> What is the "centos debacle"?
[14:43:29] <enoq> they killed rhel parity
[14:43:30] <Khepra> we'll be upgrading to ubuntu this time. the team has decided ubuntu + paid support after 5 years is the only way forward.
[14:43:30] <amacater_> Centos 8 releases never after December 31
[14:43:51] <randall> Khepra: Debian LTS also offers paid support via Freexian.
[14:43:56] <Khepra> centos is dead. it's no more. "centos stream" is NOT centos, it just shares the name. but /offtopic :)
[14:43:59] <amacater_> Khepra: Debian is a better bet: Ubuntu and paid support is only for the core of Ubuntu

[14:44:31] <Khepra> amacater_: I know that very well
[14:45:04] <amacater_> enoq: It's _not_ the same thing: Ubuntu LTS is pulled primarily from Debian unstable and testing ...

[14:46:39] <amacater_> Khepra: If you look carefully at what happened with FF91: it needed to be rebuilt on all architectures on stable oldstable etc. That meant either custom troolchains or a significant amount of effort.

[14:47:18] <Khepra> amacater_: yes, like I said, the problem is in the policies.
[14:47:44] <Khepra> if the policy were to track latest, non-esr and all the deps, then this problem wouldn't've existed
[14:48:32] <Khepra> and the kernel is anotehr story. currently oldstable's 4.19 is a swiss cheese of vulnerabilities. we're forced to roll kernel.org's due to that. which per se is okay, but we've been scrambling for the past month auditing all software because apparently secvulns are not being fixed and who knows what else is affected.
[14:49:01] <amacater_> Part of the problem is that upstream doesn't care about Debian patches / more than two architectures etc. - and the problem is the toolchain and Rust etc. - Tracking latest just makes that process significantly harder and faster to break in some respects
[14:49:14] <randall> Khepra: How do you build "latest" if your whole toolschain isn't new enough?
[14:49:29] <Khepra> ubuntu doesn't seem to have the problem with that.
[14:49:36] <Khepra> because their policy is different
[14:50:06] <randall> Khepra: Yeah, but if you start upgrading large swaths of your release, you're effectively creating a new release. So why not just call it that?
[14:50:10] <amacater_> And Ubuntu doesn't build on as many architectures also leans on Debian for some expertise

[14:51:40] <amacater_> [Sorry, that last was for Khepra]
[14:51:44] <Khepra> randall: debian backports is maintained even poorely
[14:51:51] <jelly> ubuntu has backports for build-deps in -security, very similar to debian now.  Eg. 18.04 Build-deps for firefox 95 include: rustc (>= 1.53.0), nodejs-mozilla (>= 10.21), nasm-mozilla (>= 2.14.02)
[14:52:13] <Khepra> randall: the kernel in particular. we hav a few servers with backported kernel and that too hasn't been updated for security, so we had to kill it and roll our own
[14:52:14] <jelly> debian is catching up to that
[14:53:17] <randall> Khepra: From what I've gathered on the -devel ML is that there's been a holdup on security fixes for the kernel due to workload, which AFAIR is resolved now.
[14:53:57] <Khepra> randall: dunno what's resolved, oldstable still has no updates
[14:54:21] <Khepra> I have record uptimes on some canary servers. 90+ days now since last reboot for kernel upgrade. since then there's been dozens of vuln fixes.
[14:55:28] <randall> Khepra: And the kernel build is actually affected? Some CVEs theoretically affect the version, but don't in practice because the kernel doesn't build with that module or setting.
[14:56:22] <Khepra> yes. and debian's security tracker even confirms that

[15:06:38] <jelly> as far as backporting, verifying and applying patches to longterm kernels, _noone_ is doing enough of that work and Debian is doing more than most distros
[15:07:01] <jelly> that situation is messed up starting with upstream
[15:08:00] *** keypushe- is now known as keypusher
[15:08:42] <Khepra> yes, and that's unfortunate. kernel devs want everyone to run latest possible kernels.
[15:09:14] <Khepra> so... debian could really do just that. why doesn't it rebase to latest 4.19 in oldstable every few weeks, say?
[15:09:39] <Khepra> so I'm sorry, but I don't buy the "can't" answer. seems the problem is, again, the POLICY. "we won't" rather than "we can't".

[15:49:08] <Khepra> the only problem with Ubuntu for us might be ZFS. In Debian, it's easy to manage ZFS as DKMS. even easier to bump the version or rebuild and run from github directly if you need latest kernel support until backports catch up.   that will not be possible with ubuntu due to zfs being part of regular kernel and that's an entirely different story, in ubuntu
[15:50:14] <Khepra> canonical does some _very_ offensive heresy with ZFS in order to support it across several LTS releases. version mismatch between kernel and userland an a LOT of cross patching.
[15:50:30] <amacater_> So ... don't use Ubuntu
[15:50:53] <amacater_> Strictly, isn't Ubuntu off-topic here ? :)
[15:51:25] <Khepra> ubuntu support is offtopic. this is debian support asking for arguments to convince the team to stay on debian :)
[15:52:00] <randall> Khepra: Meh, if you have specific questions, ask. I have no skin in the game to keep $company with Debian.
[15:53:08] <Khepra> seems the questions will be more relevant for debian-lts ... which is basically: can we get _good_ support for a limited number of base packages like the kernel and toolchain and the minimal gnuserland needed, so we can put our rolling release atop of that.
[15:54:26] <Khepra> the major non-base packages we use have their own .deb repos. nginx, postgresql's pgdg. dovecot has it, postfix doesn't need one. uwsgi we rebuild ourselves. PHP is the only thing I wish would be tracked dead-close to upstream.

[16:02:46] <Khepra> randall: that's not really true tho. it's maybe some slogan hanging on someone's wall, but it's not true and cannot be trusted. it's not a matter of taste. it's a sad fact.
[16:03:16] <randall> Khepra: Then skip straight to the second part and switch to a distro that fulfils whatever you think is good.

[20:10:19] <fatal> also with proprietary nvidia driver you can't get support for your kernel?
[20:10:23] <cdhowie> since when does nvidia depend on nodejs?

[20:11:15] <Khepra> that's a loaded question
[20:11:40] <fatal> anyway, you can't get support for linux kernel in this case.
[20:12:00] <Khepra> if you have kernel issues and want to ask LKML, you disable nvidia.
[20:12:03] *** Joins: amacater_ (~amacater@77.97.174.253)
[20:12:11] <cdhowie> most people using the nvidia driver aren't going to need support for the kernel directly, anyway
[20:12:18] <Khepra> if the issue is specific to nvidia, well, tough luck because nobody cares :)
[20:13:13] <cdhowie> however, if you are using secure boot then you need to disable that because the kernel will refuse to become tainted when secure boot is enabled
[20:13:59] <Khepra> secureboot is a whole other bag of cans of worms.
[20:14:33] <cdhowie> yep but it's enabled by default on recent motherboards so it is unfortunately something we have to consider
[20:14:35] <Kingsy> Khepra: yeah agreed but its annoying seeing failures after every apt-get install

[20:19:43] <Khepra> so you reproduce your issue _without_ the nvidia module loaded

[20:20:09] <Kingsy> Khepra: how would I do that? sorry not that familiar with this.
[20:20:12] <cdhowie> it's probably not going to be supported by LKML while the module is loaded, but there will be people here for example who will help
[20:20:14] <Khepra> if it doesn't reproduce, then it's likely related to nvidia and with _that_, nobody can help
[20:20:50] <fatal> probably not even 'nvidia'
[20:21:40] <Kingsy> I am confused how I ended up here. this is a brand new installation. I simply ran apt install nvidia-driver. surely the base packages are not this broken?!
[20:22:06] <Khepra> Kingsy: oh that wasn't solution for your particular problem.   but is the service eventually loaded? can you paste the related log entries? could be the first run failed but the service was restarted and after /run/<things> settled (could be permissions), subsequent runs worked fine?
[20:22:42] <Khepra> Kingsy: nvidia driver ain't a "base" package.
[20:23:14] <Kingsy> oh. ps aux | grep nvidia shows -> nvpd      3386  0.0  0.0   6680  2172 ?        Ss   16:52   0:00 /usr/bin/nvidia-persistenced --user nvpd

[23:05:58] <Khepra> what does user.js do that privacy badger plus uBlock origin don't?
[23:08:23] *** Parts: vxwarlock (~Darkcodex@user/vxwarlock) (Closing Window)
[23:11:17] <xx> first of all, privacy badger is useless if you already have ublock, and in fact makes things worse because now you have two trackers
[23:11:32] <xx> secondly, that user.js file teaches you a lot about what firefox actually does against the users wishes
[23:12:50] <sussudio> firefox once inappropriately spun the hamsterwheel while a hamster was still in it.
[23:13:11] <Khepra> oh huh, right, I'm not actually using the badger and ublock at the same time
[23:14:45] <Khepra> here's the thing tho. I have different profiles and different users for different browsing patterns. One is for sites I have to login on, our $work apps and work related things. I separate them with tab containers.
[23:15:26] <Khepra> then I have anotehr profile underr another system user, for "regular" random browsing, which us ublocked becasue that seems to block youtube video ads, and it's set on clear all data on exit, which it apparently does.
[23:15:56] <Khepra> that one I actually plan to move into a dedicated VM. yeah, no, it's not overkill :) not sarcasm.

Only problems are secure boot and iverfy on the fs. Why is ima not in the kernel by default? Almost all systems nowadays have a tpm and imo this should be used more on servers
