[22:47:20] <Xapti> What sort of method would be used to color zones that are links on a webage (INCLUDING IMAGES)? anchor elements are containers for content, so how could you put color _on top_ of something like an image?
[22:48:42] <Xapti> For my purposes I suppose borders might kind of work, but I'd prefer complete blocks/zones

[23:12:15] <Xapti> but maybe it can still work with a style sheet; I just forget how that would be done. As far as I know in the DOM containers never ovelap their containing content
[23:13:44] <Xapti> well I suppose DOM is the wrong word to use. CSS box model or something
[23:32:14] <ede> Xapti, one of the things which piss me off on the modern web is the switch from <div> .... <a> to <a> .... <div> which makes the whole block a link, so not even copying some text is possible anymore. may have to do with mobile mini screens and users with fat fingers.
[23:32:41] <Xapti> yeah
[23:33:05] <ede> i had to think of this JS project i spotted some years ago already, image slider to compare 2 images
[23:33:21] <Xapti> or simply making anchors display:block which does what you're talking about
[23:33:42] <ede> can't remember how they work, but i think it's 2 DIVs on top of each other with the slider changing the width of the top layer
[23:34:01] <Xapti> It's part of the reason why I want the colored functionality, so that I don't accidently click white space that is actually a link
[23:34:01] <ede> i've seen something recently in the side area of the DOM view
[23:34:32] <ede> some -moz-something property, was apparently meant to use some generic element as something very specific.
[23:35:11] <ede> just did the opposite in twitter. wanted in insert a link into the answer field instead it opened it on midclick :|
[23:35:39] <ede> seems i have to click it first to trigger some stupid script
[23:36:13] <ede> but i'm not sure if it's <a> only, everything could have an onClick handler
[23:37:19] <ede> i've also been on a gov site today, a page with some PDF downloads. over the text area (also had a sidebar with links) the cursor turned into a hand already. not only on the few links to the PDFs...
[23:40:32] <Xapti> not ideal, but maybe I'll just try filter:invert(10%) or something

[23:51:10] <ede> user.css or what it's called, didn't touch it in years
