[00:28:56] <velix> setting up a mailserver is no problem. I did that several times now.
[00:29:06] <velix> but for transaction mails, a "good ip" with "high reputation" is needed.
[00:29:14] <velix> I don't know if my fresh IPs can provide this.
[00:29:56] <lunaphyte> it's not about setting up a mail server
[00:30:34] <lunaphyte> it's about establishing and maintaining reputation, and about responsible list management
[00:31:03] <velix> lunaphyte: Our customers enter their mail address on order. So it's highly unlikely that I'm getting much bad addresses here.
[00:31:15] <velix> I don't do any mass sending.
[00:31:38] <lunaphyte> are you saying that this is strictly transactional email?
[00:32:04] <velix> yes
[00:32:15] <velix> "Thanks for your order, here is your bill".
[00:32:26] <velix> "Thanks for your payment, here is the link to download".
[00:32:56] <lunaphyte> that will help, yes, as far as list management [although there will still be some management to do]
[00:33:07] *** Parts: henk (~henk@leonardo.netwichtig.de) (WeeChat 2.3)
[00:33:15] <velix> lunaphyte: of course. and that's totally fine.
[00:33:16] <lunaphyte> that will not change the administrative overhead associated with reputation, however
[00:33:21] <velix> sure.
[00:33:24] <velix> But you also have this at SES.
[00:33:40] <velix> they kick you when you go over 5% mark
[00:33:44] <lunaphyte> you have it everywhere, but at varying scales
[00:33:44] <velix> kick = freeze ;)
[00:33:55] <velix> lunaphyte: I think, 13 customers a month will be much
[00:34:02] <velix> So it's very handle able
[00:34:11] <velix> handleable?
[00:34:15] <velix> easy to handle!
[00:34:45] <lunaphyte> the volume is not really of particular relevance [other than with low volume, it will take longer to develop a positive reputation]
[00:34:54] <velix> The professor told the clerk to manually create the  bills ... so he also doesn't expect many orders :D
[00:35:13] <velix> lunaphyte: sure it is. When you have 13 orders, you can take care of all the bounes.
[00:35:19] <velix> When you have 1300 orders, you can't 
[00:35:24] <velix> you need an automatic process for this then.
[00:35:34] <lunaphyte> bad deliverability doesn't magically means there will always be bounces
[00:36:30] <velix> lunaphyte: okay, so send my fax or snail mail only?
[00:36:36] <velix> might be best, true.
[00:36:41] <lunaphyte> i'm sorry?
[00:36:51] <velix> me too :(
[00:37:59] <lunaphyte> i smell a continuum fallacy
[00:38:32] <lunaphyte> but anyway, the bottom line is that you may have issues, and you'll have to deal with them in one form or another, and only you can decide if [and to what extent] that is objectionable
[00:38:53] <velix> What kind of "issues". Technical? Manwork?
[00:38:59] <lunaphyte> yes
[00:39:58] <lunaphyte> it's unlikely to be a productive endeavor to attempt to presuppose away reality :)
