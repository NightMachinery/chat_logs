[00:01:10] <mmalter> Hello guys
[00:01:16] <rawtaz> yo
[00:01:25] <mmalter> How do you get your node name after doing a mix run please?
[00:01:52] <mmalter> I wanted to set it at boot time but couldn't really find a way to do it outside of a release
[00:02:44] <mmalter> I mean it looks a bit like a shot in the dark :D
[00:06:50] *** Joins: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess)
[00:10:59] <rawtaz> stay tuned for an answer :-) (not from me)
[00:11:41] <mmalter> I am a bit worried I searched a long time :D
[00:11:55] <mmalter> Some stuff are slightly hard coming from erlang
[00:12:06] <mmalter> but I'll manage
[00:12:16] <tristan> the node/0 function returns the name
[00:12:24] <mmalter> well
[00:12:28] <mmalter> sure
[00:12:37] <mmalter> but mix run isnt rly talkative
[00:12:58] <mmalter> well, I guess I'll just print it from the code then
[00:13:17] <mmalter> Thanks
[00:13:49] <tristan> not sure wha tyou are trying to achieve. do you want to set a name? 
[00:14:01] <mmalter> ok more context
[00:15:26] <mmalter> I am setting up my workflow and I think I am going to do most things with mix. I tried setting the name with net_kernel.start but I don't really know where to put. runtime.exs seems reserved to releases.
[00:15:40] <mmalter> So in short, when I start my development node, I use mix run.
[00:15:52] <mmalter> But then, what is the name of this node? No clue.
[00:16:05] <mmalter> It's all local, not in production
[00:17:15] <mmalter> I tried grepping in ps aux but I don't see an -sname option.
[00:17:38] <benwilson512> runtime.exs is not reserved to releases
[00:17:43] <mmalter> oh
[00:17:47] <mmalter> that's something
[00:17:51] <benwilson512> releases.exs is reserved for releases, runtime.exs always runs at runtime
[00:17:57] <benwilson512> including in releases
[00:18:03] <benwilson512> but not limited to them
[00:18:28] <benwilson512> by default when you do mix run it does not set a node name
[00:19:20] <mmalter> hmmm thanks thats rly helpful. I put an IO.puts in it to make sure it's loaded and it doesn't write anything on the console so I guess I made a mistake.
[00:19:28] <mmalter> All right, I'll figure it out
[00:19:45] <mmalter> In the end, I just wanted to attach a session or connect with observer.
[00:20:06] <benwilson512> right, so you may be best off setting a name explicitly somewhere
[00:21:13] <mmalter> sorry just one last question
[00:21:20] <mmalter> would you also set the cookie there?
[00:21:28] <benwilson512> yes
[00:21:33] <mmalter> ok
[00:21:46] <benwilson512> you can do this with `Node.start` invoked in your application start clause I believe
[00:22:18] <benwilson512> see https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Node.html#start/3 and `set_cookie/1`
[00:22:25] <benwilson512> er /2
[00:23:26] <tristan> you can also pass it as ana rgument to 'elixir'
[00:23:46] <mmalter> yes sure
[00:23:54] <mmalter> I was just wondering about mix
[00:24:04] <tristan> you can run mix with 'elixir'
[00:24:16] <tristan> elixir --sname a@localhost -S mix run
[00:24:25] <mmalter> ooooh that makes a lot of sense
[00:24:32] <mmalter> errr did not think about it. thanks

[18:00:23] <m1dnight> As an academic without any real software engineering experience, what is the point of a thing like Oban?

[18:02:08] <m1dnight> And what does it mean that it uses postgres for coordination? Sorry if I'm asking silly questions ;P
[18:03:59] *** Quits: koolazer (~koo@user/koolazer) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[18:07:24] <sorentwo> m1dnight: the point of any background job framework is to perform complex, cpu intensive, concurrency limited, or otherwise slow operations out-of-band from the rest of the application.
[18:08:36] <sorentwo> Oban itself is built in Postgres, so it is transactional and provides more guarantees that you won’t lose jobs, rather than something like Redis.
[18:09:42] <m1dnight> Okay, fair enough. So it's probably more resilient compared to processes, and preserves state between crashes and whatnot
[18:09:52] <m1dnight> Looks cool, thanks for explaining.

[18:31:15] <inoas> > About 2 months ago I decided to handwrite a simple and secure authentication solution on top of a Phoenix application. I did a specification of how the system would work and e-mailed Griffin Byatt, the creator of Sobelow, a security-focused static analysis for the Phoenix.  => ...

[18:31:17] <inoas> Just reading https://dashbit.co/blog/a-new-authentication-solution-for-phoenix
[18:32:30] <josevalim> inoas: tks
[18:32:41] <inoas> Thanks for doing all this <3
[18:35:14] <inoas> > I am also aware that generating the whole code into user applications comes with downsides. After all, the user can easily modify the code, making it unsafe. To help balance that, there are code comments whenever important decisions related to security were taken. The tests also help prevent unintentional regressions.
[18:35:28] <inoas> Does the generator also import the tests into the main application?
[18:36:37] <josevalim> ya
[18:37:13] <inoas> Great
[18:41:10] <inoas> I have to eventually study the code but right now I do not understand what the encrypted cookie thing is about. Is it about cookie data on the client? Or about sessions on the server? Why would it be required to be encrypted? Do you actually store the password inside an encrypted cookie on the browser and/or in the session of the web server?

[18:52:44] <whk> the new auth generator is really good, thanks. we used it this week and just replaced the password auth with ueberauth. the user tokens works nicely with testing, global logout etc.. 
[19:11:08] <whk> it feels like devise's config has more code that what phx.gen.auth generate, but probably not the case.

[21:49:25] <hoppity> Is it possible for a Phoenix liveview app to be served under two different URLs? Specifically with 'www' and without.
[21:49:54] <hoppity> I see benwilson512's answer here: https://elixirforum.com/t/how-do-i-configure-multiple-hosts-for-phoenix-liveview/24124   but my app already has check_origin = false so I'm not sure how to proceed
[21:58:05] <phaleth> hoppity: he says there to configure check_origin to be a list check_origin = ["yourdomain.com", "www.yourdomain.com"] I guess
[21:58:53] <hoppity> phaleth: but if my check_origin is already false, how come I can conect to my app without 'www' but cannot connect when using 'www'?
[21:59:06] <hoppity> cannot* connect
[21:59:24] <hoppity> sorry can* connect.. geez I need coffee lol
[22:02:34] <azazel> :-D
[22:02:46] <phaleth> hoppity: dunno, from what I've already tried with liveview the url config in prod.exs is what makes a difference, not sure if there can be multiple values... url: [host: "example.com", port: 80]

[22:19:18] <hoppity> I just ran a vulnerability scan on my Phoenix app and am seeing that phx_gen_auth does not seem to be using Anti-CSRF Tokens. Is this true or am I missing something?

[22:23:07] <hoppity> It's weird because I can see via "view source" that there are hidden inputs labeled as anti csrf in my login forms but for some reason ZAP (the tool I am using for vuln scan) resports no Anti CSRF
[22:24:35] <hoppity> I think I found the issue, the vuln scan tool is looking for very specific labels in forms but since phx_gen_auth puts an underscore before the hidden csrf_token input field name it is therefore not detected

[22:55:48] <whk> sorentwo: sorry, me again. should `Oban.Cron.Expression.parse!("* 1/2 * * *")` not return hours 1, 3, 5... it returns `hours: #MapSet<[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]>` from master. same with 1-23/2.

[23:00:01] <sorentwo> whk: I’m not entirely sure. That’s a non-standard syntax and the definition I found is “every second hour from 1 through 23”, it doesn’t say anything about whether the starting point is 1.
[23:01:08] <sorentwo> For other step ranges it means every nth step between the first and last value of the range.
[23:02:30] <sorentwo> Ah, I found something else about it:If you specify a range starting other than at 0, the number (say N) after the / specifies every Nth minute/hour/etc starting at the lower bound of the range. For example, 3-23/7 in the second field means every 7th hour starting at 03:00 (03:00, 10:00, 17:00).
[23:03:58] <whk> that is how i understand it. let me check something...

[23:08:49] <whk> ""/<number>" specifies skips of the number's value through the range. eg: 1-23/2 would be 1, skip 2, 3, skip 2 5. 1/2 i assume is the shortcut. ( from crontab man page )
