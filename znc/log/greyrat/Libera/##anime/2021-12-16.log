[00:06:57] <MootPoot> any good over a flat?
[00:07:00] <MootPoot> or more annoying
[00:07:55] <Bco1981> when that wide, i kinda like it's curved, if it was that wide and completly flat, i think it would be hard to see properly at the edges

[00:08:11] <ImoutoBot> [title] AOC C24G1A 24" Curved Frameless Gaming Monitor, FHD 1920x1080, 1500R, VA, 1ms MPRT, 165Hz (144Hz Supported), FreeSync Premium, Height Adjustable Black : Amazon.ca: Electronics
[00:08:12] <MootPoot> I'm looking at this one
[00:08:22] <Bco1981> va...
[00:08:36] <Bco1981> 24"... why curved ?
[00:08:43] <MootPoot> desk space
[00:09:03] <Bco1981> yeah it uses more desk space then a flat
[00:09:08] <MootPoot> oh really
[00:09:10] <MootPoot> hrm
[00:09:42] <Bco1981> the depth of it since the edges curve out towards you unlike a flat
[00:09:58] <MootPoot> for some reason this is the cheapest modern 1080p monitor on amazon right now
[00:10:01] <MootPoot> idk why
[00:11:27] <TsundereNoises> yeah, isn't the whole justification for curved screens supposed to be about peripheral vision or something?
[00:12:01] <TsundereNoises> but at 24"...
[00:12:39] <Bco1981> even 27" as i use right now, is no problem if it's flat, and i don't see a reason for it to be curved.
[00:13:03] <Bco1981> well it's only 16:9 so if it was ultrawide... maybe
[00:13:11] <MootPoot> I thought maybe in a cramped space it would be easier to fit in
[00:13:14] <MootPoot> I guess not
[00:15:16] <MootPoot> driving 3 displays with a gtx 1050
[00:15:21] <MootPoot> poor thing
[00:16:43] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: when I was shopping for monitors I read something about how curved screens were supposed to be at the "natural" angle of curvature for your vision, which makes a certain amount of sense
[00:17:04] <MootPoot> yeah, but I'm not coughing up for a 34" curved one
[00:17:04] <TsundereNoises> but then I did the math and a lot of the ones I was looking at, for that to be true you'd have to have them like 7 ft away from your face
[00:17:32] <MootPoot> what - how big of a screen were you looking at
[00:17:38] <TsundereNoises> not very
[00:17:40] <TsundereNoises> which is the point
[00:17:44] <TsundereNoises> you can't curve much on a smaller screen
[00:17:53] <TsundereNoises> so you'd need it to be at a greater radius for that to be true
[00:18:02] <MootPoot> so one of those massive ones
[00:18:02] <TsundereNoises> which is to say it's fucking stupid
[00:18:09] <MootPoot> it neccessary
[00:18:10] <Bco1981> and too small with curve looks weird
[00:18:49] <Bco1981> still monitor i'm talking about
[00:19:07] <MootPoot> its like a loli with curves
[00:19:19] <MootPoot> curves belong on milfs
[00:19:26] <MootPoot> with big honkers
[00:19:27] <Bco1981> big ones
[00:19:30] <TsundereNoises> yeah, I like my monitors like I like my Suisei

[04:22:43] <Satin> i can withdraw what i put in

[11:27:01] <listen_ers> no its extremely state of the art.¬† one needs to learn packaging from linux should use it i know this from multiple sources
[11:27:11] <Bco1981> listen_ers: how do you update 14.42 to current without breaking the system ? glibc gets updated and fucks everything up.
[11:27:56] <listen_ers> true, thats why you look diligently into the iissue
[11:28:02] <listen_ers> if you dont want to install from current directly
[11:28:23] <Urchin[emacs]> listen_ers: interesting, it used to be all manual package installation
[11:28:41] <Bco1981> Urchin[emacs]: it has slackpkg now
[11:28:48] <listen_ers> you have to upgrade. upgrade glibc-solibs first (the mother package of the machine) then make sure you set your skackpkg blacklist accordingly dont upgrade iirc headers, kernels (those should be in there already, anyway)
[11:29:18] <listen_ers> if you upgrade without that last reply in mind your machine will be in the current state you experience
[11:29:38] <listen_ers> which is the tip of the society of cars so to speak

[11:31:53] <listen_ers> its scriptable and its lead by benevolent dictator
[11:31:58] <listen_ers> why do add it is what makes it so special
[11:32:16] <listen_ers> it is an opinion
[11:32:31] <listen_ers> thats why theres distro with package managers and we have opinions about too
[11:33:32] <listen_ers> true i couldnt imagine slackware running broken well after an upgrade through not adding that to the config in slackpkg but otherwise it runs superbly
[11:33:44] <listen_ers> broken that is
[11:33:45] <Bco1981> slackware isn't programming... it's legos. you put together the system you want from the packages you want. thoes packages are precompiled.

[11:49:30] <Satin> i've been using linux on and off since 2011
[11:49:32] <listen_ers> dude whoevers distros is the ruler of the distros is entirely my opinion and mine alone
[11:50:11] <Bco1981> because a 486 can't boot from cd, so a bootable floppy that loads dos and dos cd drivers, makes a 100mb fat16 partition for the bootloader.
[11:50:47] <listen_ers> fat16 yea yesterday or something i learn ext2 is ideal for /boot because of the many reads and less writes
[11:50:59] <listen_ers> and lilo can even install to it
[11:51:19] <Bco1981> well i don't have a linux bootable floppy
[11:51:24] <listen_ers> i was using btrfs or for some reason the installer doesnt autodetect it at all which force me to know it
[11:51:32] <listen_ers> oh yea the floppy
[11:51:36] <Bco1981> the initial boot image it too big for a floppy
[11:51:46] <listen_ers> oh for 486
[11:52:29] <Bco1981> but after the initial install, i have update process from 8.0 to 11.0
[11:52:42] <Bco1981> but beyond that the 64mb ram isn't really enough
[11:53:43] <listen_ers> yea it sounds like good desktop for learning the early kernel
[11:54:19] <listen_ers> tho thats a whole nother topic altogether and completely unnecessary if you arent in a good position or it is not worth a persons time

[12:05:27] <Satin> lul
[12:05:36] <Satin> ig i could in the worst circumstances
[12:05:49] <listen_ers> i think even if you do learn the proper slackpkg upgrade you do run into more issues such as bootloader issues with newer kernels in particular.
[12:05:49] <Satin> sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
[12:05:51] <Satin> hisssssss
[12:06:09] <listen_ers> those two then you have a good basis for saving your work. it can be any other way then its just as good
[12:06:39] <listen_ers> not some funky samsung desktop mode ngl
[12:06:44] <listen_ers> i wouldnt try using that too much
[12:06:57] <listen_ers> you need dependable non breakable features that do not crop up
[12:07:22] <MootPoot> Kinda want another monitor though for the basement
[12:08:45] <MootPoot> Or just use the projector really
[12:08:45] <Satin> i don't think you'll even use it
[12:09:06] <MootPoot> I'm moving all my tools and shit to the basement
[12:09:09] <Bco1981> MootPoot: just remote into it ?
[12:09:42] <Bco1981> rpd, that is what i do with my two pc's in my basement 100meters away from my apartment

[12:10:27] <listen_ers> then theres always falling back in this day in age to slackware live edition it basically locks you in to a generic kernel and initrd while learning slackware. and features are being expand this very time to more machine adding secureboot support which is coming. theres no question this flavor distro is state of the art the people who make it use

[12:14:29] <Satin> i'd download wsl first
[12:14:31] <MootPoot> S_T_A_N: because JS is kinda shit

[12:14:56] <S_T_A_N> I am playing this bad programing idle game lol
[12:15:08] <listen_ers> what is wsl isnt that just mingsys?
[12:15:13] <listen_ers> or mingw
[12:15:27] <listen_ers> it paves the path for it since you can use it i assume
[12:15:30] <S_T_A_N> trying to make a script to upload a file to all my pw0nd servers
[12:15:33] <MootPoot> Satin: supposedly you can connect physical devices to wsl now
[12:15:42] <listen_ers> emacs, vlc, and the likes have their mingw compile
[12:15:53] <MootPoot> Handy for running Windows but dealing with NAS or embedded
[12:15:53] <listen_ers> oh and ffmpeg suite
[12:16:03] <Satin> MootPoot: sigh
[12:16:05] <listen_ers> vlc just use windows version but its funny theres a mingw version
[12:16:12] <Satin> i mean that's cool
[12:16:26] <MootPoot> lol
[12:16:31] <listen_ers> yea wsl must be more deeper developer level on windows
[12:16:41] <listen_ers> maybe more commands too
[12:16:46] <S_T_A_N> also dumb because I can't(?) just be like, look at this script, run it.
[12:17:09] <MootPoot> If your work is like 90%+ on windows then dual booting is a pain really
[12:17:20] <MootPoot> I'd rather just use the wsl

[14:16:12] <amigojapan> Not a Linux program
[14:16:55] <DaPinkOne> :/ a lot of programs aren't linux programs.
[14:17:20] <amigojapan> Yeah use a Linux program
[14:18:02] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: I think it is not so hard with wsl2 but I have only tried wsl 1
[14:18:11] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: there's putty for linux
[14:18:27] <DaPinkOne> I don't see the point of a terminal irc client if i've gotta use a graphical terminal emulator via the x server
[14:18:38] <Urchin[emacs]> amigojapan: it's especially useful on Linux for telnetting to nethack servers
[14:18:40] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: pretty sure it is crap

[14:20:06] <amigojapan> Urchin[emacs]: that is a possible problem
[14:21:02] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: I was able to use weechat on wsl1 without X too
[14:21:13] <DaPinkOne> guake segfaults out of the box.
[14:21:22] <amigojapan> So it should work without X
[14:21:29] <Urchin[emacs]> hm... I'm getting hiragana displayed just fine in Emacs accessed through putty

[14:40:03] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I have watched several videos on flying ointments
[14:40:59] <darkwitch> amigojapan, do you still want to try it?
[14:41:14] <amigojapan> darkwitch: it seems some of them are legal in the US and can be bought from other people. But unfortunately that is the US, Japan seems to be much more strict
[14:41:56] <amigojapan> darkwitch: one of the witches I saw said I need to ask my doctor if I am taking medication
[14:43:35] <amigojapan> darkwitch: and she said it actually induces dreams. I am already an avid dreamer
[14:44:08] <darkwitch> then I say you should experiment with lucid dreaming

[14:44:38] <darkwitch> it's way less disruptive than poisoning yourself

[14:45:10] <amigojapan> darkwitch: hmm. I already enjoy most of my dreams

[14:51:12] <amigojapan> Why mess with it?
[14:51:36] <darkwitch> why take flying ointments unless you want to fly?
[14:51:59] <amigojapan> Well I did not know it affected dreams
[14:51:59] <darkwitch> you can fly in your dream
[14:52:05] <amigojapan> Yeah
[14:53:18] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I have already flown in my dreams before
[14:53:31] <amigojapan> It's a pretty common dream
[14:54:39] <amigojapan> darkwitch: altho my most common good dream is that I am back in school. And I am the only adult in a school full of kids
[14:54:55] <darkwitch> so if you learn about it, you can make it happen more consciously by choice instead of seemingly a random occurrence

[17:38:06] <omero> Sadale: that is a very philosophical question
[17:38:20] <Sadale> true. Just a random question come up in my mind :S
[17:38:30] <omero> what is a person?
[17:38:54] <Sadale> dunno. I'm a person. You're a person. ImoutoBot is a person.

[17:39:34] <omero> yes
[17:39:55] <Sadale> Meanwhile the imouto that's in the same room with me right now is actually a person
[17:40:06] <omero> he has no self consciousness (unless someone proves me otherwise)
[17:40:10] <beaky> what is it like to have an imouto
[17:40:13] <Sadale> I'm got an imouto that's physically sitting in the same room as I do :3

[21:42:12] <TsundereNoises> and I just don't think it's as big a change as it feels like
[21:42:16] <Satin> and that's why I see this as an instance of that - yes fundamentally the core phenomona is the same, but comparing it and saying "it's the same thing all over again" might conceal the deadly effectiveness, or the even more direct ways this changes things
[21:42:21] <TsundereNoises> newspapers have declined in power as twitter has risen
[21:42:29] <TsundereNoises> or rather as tv news rose, and tv declines with twitter, whatever
[21:42:40] <TsundereNoises> but we've always been hungry to suck up any propaganda fed to us

[21:42:56] <Satin> social media's way of propoganda is much different than newspapers
[21:42:57] <MootPoot> they're making pistons by hand
[21:43:02] <MootPoot> didn't even know that was possible
[21:43:21] <Satin> it's about gaming the platform to have as much retweets/likes as much as possible, within provactive 244 chaacters
[21:43:34] <TsundereNoises> Satin: in the echo chamber sense I'm actually inclined to agree with you, but media has always been a tool for people with power to maintain the status quo
[21:43:38] <Satin> it's about social media sites and what they mark as valid on the trending page
[21:43:46] <TsundereNoises> and/or change it to make money
[21:44:06] <Satin> TsundereNoises: well I don't disagree with that very broad concepeptual aspect, stuff like "it's always been used as a tool to maintain the status quo" etc
[21:44:20] <Satin> but I disagree with, when comparing it, saying it's about the same
[21:44:26] <TsundereNoises> Satin: twitter only has power because we've collectively agreed that it does, the same used to be true of any number of other things
[21:44:36] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I had to fap 7 times last night before I could go to sleep
[21:44:40] <TsundereNoises> retweets don't necessarily translate into votes, for example
[21:44:42] <MootPoot> still wasen't empty
[21:45:07] <Satin> let's not underestimate the power of digital propoganda, with the slab of metal most of us are on in our pockets for most of the day!
[21:45:57] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I was actually reading something interesting about YA publishing the other day, twitter has become really important to YA book marketting, but twitter is much more popular among middle-aged women than teens, and that's apparently shifted YA to cater more toward middle-age women apparently
[21:46:11] <TsundereNoises> or at least more engaged with by*
[21:46:12] <Satin> rofl not surprised
[21:46:32] <TsundereNoises> but it comes from publishers basically deciding twitter was the be all end all of marketting
[21:46:33] <Satin> yeah, the much more younger teenies go to snapchat and tiktok and <insert next cutting edge app site out to datamine them>
[21:46:48] <MootPoot> get datamined
[21:46:57] <Satin> I'm just saying, the devil's in the details sort of thing
[21:46:58] <MootPoot> pounded senseless, really

[21:47:28] <ButterNoodle> unrar
[21:47:29] <TsundereNoises> Satin: and people used to have tv news on a lot more than they do now
[21:47:53] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I guess I think you're underestimating how effective other forms of propaganda were
[21:48:11] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I think if there's a change due to social media, it's in the ability to exclude dissenting opinions
[21:48:23] <TsundereNoises> and previously that ability was limited to the rich guys who owned centralized media
[21:48:32] <TsundereNoises> but dissenting opinions have always been marginalized
[21:48:40] <Jigsy> 3>having dissenting opinions
[21:48:46] <Jigsy> WHoA, You cAn't dO THAt!
[21:48:51] <TsundereNoises> just there was a certain level of respectability at many but not all times that people strove for

[21:50:19] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: for RJ45 - do I NEED to have those plastic boot things
[21:50:44] <Bco1981> plastic boot?
[21:50:56] <MootPoot> yeah the little plastic/rubber thing behind the connector
[21:51:10] <MootPoot> that covers up the join between the cable and the actual connector
[21:51:19] <Bco1981> no
[21:51:57] <Bco1981> those are only good for when your cables are tangled and you just pull.
[21:52:14] <MootPoot> I found like 50m worth of UTP patch cable
[21:52:21] <MootPoot> that a rabbit ( dont ask ) chewed through
[21:52:23] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: no
[21:52:38] <MootPoot> so instead of buying more cables I thought why not just chop this one up
[21:52:43] <TsundereNoises> Satin: anyway, I guess my thought is the "have to wade through an ocean of shilling, memes, and disinformation" has been true of lots of areas of political and science reporting for as long as I've been paying attention
[21:52:47] <ButterNoodle> just make sure the pairs are right
[21:52:50] <Bco1981> rats even eat fiber optical cables
[21:52:50] <TsundereNoises> and seems to have been true well before I was born
[21:52:55] <ButterNoodle> twists to the tip
[21:52:57] <ButterNoodle> ez
[21:53:24] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: the two splices behind my house had both mice and squirrels chewing up shit
[21:53:26] <Satin> TsundereNoises: I mean yeah for sure, but again, I just think some tools/phenomona are very effective than others
[21:53:29] <ButterNoodle> *inside
[21:53:45] <Satin> I'm not saying that the past ones weren't effective, but they didn't objectively have the same reach that modern internet has
[21:53:48] <Bco1981> little bastards
[21:53:52] <TsundereNoises> Satin: like media around the start of WWII is pretty interesting, when we still had a lot of nazi sympathizers arguing hitler wasn't that bad
[21:53:58] <Satin> lol
[21:53:59] <MootPoot> got a cheap crimper and tester thing

[21:55:37] <Satin> that i will do
[21:55:51] <TsundereNoises> I mean I kind of think that's true for everyone, including myself
[21:55:54] <TsundereNoises> history is super interesting
[21:56:13] <TsundereNoises> I don't see how you can say it doesn't repeat though, other than making a semantic argument
[21:56:31] <TsundereNoises> I don't believe in any kind of great cycle or anything, but I don't think that's what the vast majority of people mean when they say history repeats itself
[21:56:34] <Satin> It is, but I just see "factors" and things like say, the economic conditions, the social conditions, the form of mass media technology that is used more powerful to analyze a lot of things
[21:56:42] <TsundereNoises> parallels are constant and enlightening
[21:56:45] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: idk on that crimper
[21:56:50] <Satin> mass media like the radio and TV are objectively more effective at propoganda than newspapers and so on
[21:57:15] <Satin> the world of culturual commodification, disney, and so on is very different from before
[21:57:36] <Satin> *subtle reference to the frankfurt school's analysis*
[21:57:43] <TsundereNoises> religion has always been a great deliverer of propaganda, and that's older than print

[21:58:50] <MootPoot> he senses the intellectuals talking about lobster social hiarchy 
[21:58:58] <MootPoot> and comes down from his vegetable tree to smite us
[21:59:10] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I guess I think humans, or at least a significant majority of humans, are just inclined to form opinions based on what's effective propaganda
[21:59:13] <TsundereNoises> since forever
[21:59:25] <TsundereNoises> a lot of people like to be told their opinions
[21:59:54] <TsundereNoises> and I'm NOT convinced that twitter or radio is more effective at that than newspapers or your local church
[22:00:00] <MootPoot> you told me you were submissive and breedable TsundereNoises 
[22:00:08] <TsundereNoises> I think that's an argument that actually has to be made, not an objective fact you can just spit out
[22:01:26] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: yes but only to someone who proves they're the intellectual alpha
[22:01:37] <MootPoot> I guess that's only emmeka then
[22:01:49] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: well it's certainly not going to be anyone who likes jordan peterson
[22:02:01] <MootPoot> true, but the lobster memes are on point
[22:02:37] <emmeka> Satin meh. I'm not sure that's true.
[22:02:54] <emmeka> once upon a time you had no access to information that wasn't mass media.
[22:02:56] <MootPoot> the thing with jordan is that people seem to think he's the problem imo
[22:03:15] <MootPoot> the issue is that a signficiant number of people like him - there is some kind of untapped market there
[22:03:19] <MootPoot> same deal with trump

[22:04:14] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I guess I agree with that, although per the earlier point, there have always been stupid people who market themselves as great thinkers to stupid people
[22:04:47] <MootPoot> problem the left wing has a hard time marketing itself to average and pooer white people
[22:04:47] <emmeka> MootPoot reactionaries exist, in other news, water is wet
[22:05:00] <MootPoot> emmeka: well, yes, but that's not really the point
[22:05:05] <MootPoot> that I'm making
[22:05:33] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: decades of anti-intellectualism don't help, we don't value critical thinking as a society, and we don't like people with complicated ideas
[22:05:43] <TsundereNoises> and most complicated problems don't have one sentence solutions
[22:06:03] <TsundereNoises> so people like dumb solutions that are easy to understand without thinking about more than actual solutions that would help
[22:06:15] <TsundereNoises> or even discussing things that might or might not help but are complicated enough to consider
[22:06:17] <MootPoot> mmmm
[22:06:26] <emmeka> that seems more like a misanthropic cop out than an actual explanation of forces at work
[22:06:46] <TsundereNoises> me?
[22:06:49] <emmeka> yeah
[22:06:51] <TsundereNoises> maybe
[22:06:55] <MootPoot> wa-ta-shi?
[22:06:57] <MootPoot> :3
[22:06:57] <TsundereNoises> feeling pretty misanthropic about all this
[22:07:10] <TsundereNoises> but I do think there's some truth to what I'm saying
[22:07:14] <TsundereNoises> and it wasn't what I was trying to say before
[22:07:39] <TsundereNoises> and it is really really hard to get people to listen to the less simple plan
[22:07:46] <TsundereNoises> that's something I've experienced a lot personally
[22:08:01] <Satin> back, got some unholy salad and a piece of sausage in the same plate
[22:08:06] <TsundereNoises> trying to get people to agree to a complicated strategy is hard
[22:08:06] <MootPoot> another gripe is that people wont accept a solution that is less then perfect
[22:08:09] <Satin> i'll read through what was said ig
[22:08:09] <MootPoot> for some reason
[22:08:19] <TsundereNoises> a significant number of people stop listening if it stops being simple
[22:08:26] <MootPoot> Satin: get that meat and salad in your mouth slut
[22:08:28] <TsundereNoises> and that's a fact I've experienced in real life a LOT
[22:08:29] <MootPoot> :3
[22:08:35] <emmeka> I don't think there's any more anti-intellectualism than there's ever been, if anything there is vastly less, but we as a society have decided that intellectuals of privileged families don't get the monopoly on thinking anymore, and any shmuck with wifi can be an ideologue
[22:08:39] <Satin> MootPoot: at least it's not carbs

[22:09:19] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I more mean, if you have a group project, people often don't want to take the time to consider a more complicated plan of action if something worse but simpler has been proposed
[22:09:23] <emmeka> TsundereNoises I think walking down this path is how you end up at technocratic and neoreactionary viewpoints
[22:09:24] <TsundereNoises> I've experienced that a lot
[22:09:39] <emmeka> it is in its own way a backwards and reactionary way to view the problem
[22:09:53] <Satin> you're both talking over each other
[22:10:00] <Poeticode> do your own research, but make sure your sources aren't from accredited scientists
[22:10:11] <TsundereNoises> ugh
[22:10:26] <TsundereNoises> "do your own research, everyone is qualified to be an expert in every field!"
[22:10:29] <Satin> one party is referencing people's mindsets in general with complicated information, and there's a lot of merit to that point that people want to push the burden of what to think onto other things, and want to be told simple "truths"
[22:10:53] <Satin> while the other is arguing that in this era, anti intellectualism is just as bad as it has been in the past or even less
[22:10:55] <Poeticode> my truth can beat up your truth
[22:10:58] <MootPoot> do your own reserach seems to be imo = " I dont know enough to prove it to you "
[22:11:11] <TsundereNoises> Satin: yeah, I've found if I want people to agree with my strategy, it helps to not actually explain it as well as I'd personally like it explained
[22:11:25] <TsundereNoises> at least for a majority of people, some people like details but we're the minority
[22:12:21] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: to me it seems more a way to tell people to ignore experts, because you can find a website out there arguing for any possible position well enough to convince someone who would really like to believe whatever it is
[22:12:24] <Satin> meanwhile, me, at least earlier was making the point that I'm skeptical of history repeating itself in many ways, would rather look at individual factors and conditions, and that I think that mass media and now the internet is objectively better at propoganda and influencing people than other means like newspapers in the past
[22:12:47] <TsundereNoises> Satin: nicely summarized, I think
[22:13:14] <emmeka> the notion that we should trust scientists on political problems is itself a novel one. acting like there's some mass reaction against Logic and Reason instead of grappling with the fact that mass support for rule based on those kind of principles is new is just basically reactionary itself.

[22:14:01] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: the notion that we should trust politicians on science problems is a novel one too
[22:14:09] <Satin> TsundereNoises: LOL
[22:14:21] <emmeka> the idea that science has a place in politics is itself novel.
[22:14:33] <Satin> my existence is novel
[22:14:46] <Satin> aswell
[22:14:54] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: well I guess my problem is this idea that facts don't have a place in politics
[22:15:05] <TsundereNoises> and that somehow that makes ME the reactionary

[22:16:15] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: do you think that subject area experts shouldn't matter when it comes to questions of fact?
[22:16:27] <TsundereNoises> or that we shouldn't try to understand facts when we construct political policy?
[22:16:48] <TsundereNoises> or is this a "facts don't exist" kind of thing

[22:18:39] <Satin> it's a double edged sword
[22:18:40] <emmeka> people are wrong about things, because they're idiots who don't listen to Science, Logic and Reason -> political power should rest with those who are Qualified (by existing self-enforcing bodies that select heavily for privilege) -> fascism

[22:19:16] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: and it is pretty damn well established that as we learn more and more about different areas, it's increasingly impossible for anyone to know enough about everything, and has been for a long time
[22:19:45] <Satin> what you're describing is the "worst case scenario"

[22:20:09] <emmeka> Satin well 3 is the natural outcome of 2, but 2 is not necessarily the natural outcome of 1. But, it flirts dangerously with it.
[22:20:12] <Satin> and a culture that actively has healthy debate and qualified experts that guide public policy
[22:20:26] <emmeka> "qualified experts"
[22:20:29] <Satin> indeed
[22:20:31] <Satin> qualified experts
[22:20:44] <emmeka> a statement you make without questioning anything involved in that adjective
[22:20:52] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: as I've said, NO ONE is an expert on everything, or even most things
[22:20:59] <emmeka> and just trust is done properly because that is fact
[22:21:19] <Satin> I do question it, and I'm not naive about the potential consequences, but you're arguing against its very existence

[22:21:21] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: so I don't see how I could be arguing that experts must hold all power, I just think expert opinions should be given weight over "the average person" when considering issues in that area of expertise
[22:21:41] <Satin> I'm saying, the devil relies on the details, but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater with your criticisms of it
[22:21:53] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: questioning what "qualified" means is a whole giant argument that's different for different types of expertise anyway
[22:21:58] <Satin> ^^
[22:22:16] <Satin> s/relies/depends/
[22:22:17] <TsundereNoises> and I don't appreciate you projecting onto me this opinion that I trust it's just always done properly
[22:22:25] <Satin> ^
[22:22:29] <MootPoot> dont bully my tsun!
[22:22:38] <TsundereNoises> I have spent a significant amount of time ranting about bad peer review standards in biology for instance!
[22:22:38] <emmeka> Satin I'm not gonna argue on the merits of technocratic rule with you, I'm not particularly interested in convincing you why this might be terrible or how it is inherently reactionary. I'm just trying to point out how the thought process at work here *is* technocratic
[22:22:49] <Satin> fair
[22:23:08] <TsundereNoises> and I don't claim to know what the issues are with, for example, experts on bridge engineering
[22:23:33] <TsundereNoises> I feel like emmeka just decided I'm a technocrat boogeyman here
[22:23:45] <Satin> I can acknowledge that to some extent it's probably technocratic, but my counterargument (or cop out heh) is that it's sustainable with a "healthy culture" that prevents things from going south there
[22:23:48] <emmeka> TsundereNoises no, only when you started actually advocating it
[22:24:27] <TsundereNoises> I think people having their own facts is a huge problem
[22:24:34] <TsundereNoises> it's been especially bad lately, but has always been a thing
[22:24:41] <TsundereNoises> and has also been worse at other periods of history
[22:24:41] <emmeka> meh, not really

[22:25:56] <Satin> fked
[22:25:59] <MootPoot> sasuage and salad is a okay combo
[22:26:07] <MootPoot> although it wont fill you up really
[22:26:24] <MootPoot> and sasuage ( the store kind ) sometimes has a small amount of bread filler and a lot of salt
[22:26:28] <MootPoot> you can do better imo
[22:26:35] <Satin> TsundereNoises: well what you're just pushing for is a usual liberal (and this is not a bad word to me or anything inherently) position where there's democracy, but there's also social institutions with experts and what not
[22:26:42] <SummerSkies> do vegetarians substitute chicksn in caesar salads
[22:26:57] <Satin> and it's not hard to tell emmeka's government-institutional-critical leanings, and "power to the people" mentality on stuff like this
[22:27:06] <TsundereNoises> Satin: yes, I do agree with that, I'm just a bit cautious of the label for other reasons
[22:27:14] <Satin> I might be misrepresenting a bit but i think i know what i mean
[22:27:17] <emmeka> if anything, in the present day, we have the unprecedented situation that huge swaths of the electorate vote based on beliefs that are fundamentally scientific and gleaned from education in institutions over family and religious teachings
[22:27:20] <TsundereNoises> I'm not a big fan of some areas of government myself
[22:27:28] <Satin> so this isn't surprising at all this is happening to me lel
[22:27:37] <SummerSkies> emmeka God and Jesus have a great presence outside of politics
[22:27:59] <MootPoot> Satin: its the french in him - be kind to the lad 
[22:28:11] <emmeka> guillotine pour le win
[22:28:16] <Satin> lol
[22:28:16] <MootPoot> lol
[22:28:37] <SummerSkies> I decided long ago that the ones who claim to be the biggest supporters and influencers of religion and god stuff are actually the worst at it
[22:28:50] <SummerSkies> something like that doesn't take a big public display or any kind of self claiming
[22:28:50] <Satin> MootPoot: I'm not particularly siding with either because I'm spineless, but I do agree more with the existence of social institutions with experts as long as there's a healthy culture revolving around it
[22:29:00] <SummerSkies> or worship or a day of each week or huge expensive buildings
[22:29:00] <MootPoot> I decided long ago that you would make a cute girl SummerSkies 
[22:29:05] <SummerSkies> that was all human misunderstanding
[22:29:28] <SummerSkies> MootPoot ive actually ben told that
[22:29:35] <MootPoot> Satin: there is that aspect - religion as a culture vs religion as a religion/belief
[22:29:36] <TsundereNoises> Satin: well like I said, I don't think you CAN have any individual who knows enough, and the more we know about biology/physics/etc the more true that gets
[22:30:09] <TsundereNoises> there are a whole lot of things I can't possibly know enough about to make an informed decision
[22:30:22] <emmeka> SummerSkies it's true, God and Jesus have a huge presence outside of politics, for example, their followers genocided my family.
[22:30:22] <TsundereNoises> and there are things where I can make an informed decision where I believe other people can't
[22:30:24] <Satin> *time to play devil's advocate*
[22:30:30] <emmeka> that is pretty huge in presence, genocide
[22:30:38] <SummerSkies> emmeka: I didn't hear about that
[22:30:41] <TsundereNoises> I think someone knowing more than someone else about a given topic is just an absolute fact, and that that's important to take into account
[22:31:18] <Satin> TsundereNoises: the problem to me of course with this model is, "authority" on anything can be misused very easily. Science becomes the new God. Scientists and "experts" of anything become arbitrators of access to The Truth which is more complicated than it can at first seem
[22:31:22] <SummerSkies> but emmeka, it's still just the behavior of humans who feel the need to claim moral high ground through overblown religious worship

[22:31:37] <SummerSkies> bad people running from being bad while staying ad
[22:31:53] <TsundereNoises> Satin: and I think that's an easy boogeyman
[22:32:13] <Satin> probably
[22:32:22] <Satin> but there is merit to that argument/criticalness as well of that
[22:32:32] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I don't think most scientists think of science as god, that's sort of against the concept although like everything you have some weirdos
[22:32:34] <emmeka> just like the stupid redneck with a twitter account is a boogeyman, though
[22:32:41] <TsundereNoises> but it's a great talking point for religious people
[22:32:59] <TsundereNoises> Satin: the whole concept is to argue and present evidence and logic
[22:33:22] <emmeka> you gotta choose which you care about. democracy, autonomy and due process, or having scientists get more say in all the things
[22:33:22] <Satin> TsundereNoises: it's not about if scientists think about it as some sort of god - I think most don't exactly see themselves as such, but the role it plays in say, a liberal society, turns it into one
[22:33:34] <emmeka> like if you care more about the latter I'm not gonna stop you
[22:33:38] <Satin> if you want to get down the rabbit hole on this, michel focault's works are pretty good for being critical of science itself being the arbitor of truth and all
[22:33:42] <emmeka> but you gotta own it
[22:33:43] <Satin> for one xeample

[22:34:06] <Satin> oui
[22:34:12] <Satin> credit where it is due
[22:34:14] <emmeka> ta yeule
[22:34:38] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: democracy and autonomy are not in opposition to using evidence for decision making!
[22:34:41] <Satin> TsundereNoises: science and experts did a whole lot of damage on people in the 20th century
[22:34:43] <Satin> psychology
[22:35:08] <Satin> shock therapy and so much more, science was intermingled with the nazis way of doing things 
[22:35:11] <Satin> but i'm sure you know all of this
[22:35:18] <TsundereNoises> and I think people like to misunderstand or misrepresent what science even means
[22:35:22] <TsundereNoises> which is a sexier argument
[22:35:39] <Satin> TsundereNoises: it's more like this argument isn't about science itself, the scientific method, or enlightenment style thinking of the search for truths
[22:35:43] <TsundereNoises> "science" isn't this monolithic thing
[22:36:02] <TsundereNoises> there's way too much to untangle with all that
[22:36:04] <TsundereNoises> ugh
[22:36:12] <Satin> this argument from emmeka and such is more about the role it ends up playing, with qualified cordoned off experts having cultural and legal and political influence over the proceedings in society
[22:36:13] <TsundereNoises> but for one thing, the nazis weren't some great rationalists
[22:36:15] <emmeka> well yes that's precisely the problem
[22:36:17] <Satin> aka what role they occupy,
[22:36:23] <Satin> in society
[22:36:27] <TsundereNoises> people have always liked to twist things to get the answer they want
[22:36:28] <Satin> and less about science and the scientific method itself
[22:36:35] <TsundereNoises> that's true of science, it's true of relgion
[22:37:21] <emmeka> you're presenting this notion of science as truth and scientists as the ones ordained by truth itself to convey its message
[22:37:35] <Satin> I'm not naive to that, but I still am in favour of cordoned off experts anyways. [strike]and I believe most people want that too because people are beasts of burden for someone else's ideology [/strike]
[22:37:40] <TsundereNoises> the "ordained" thing is some belief you're projecting onto me
[22:37:43] <emmeka> instead of acknowledging the social implications of scientific institutions
[22:38:02] <emmeka> what is the university if not the oldest bastion of social privilege and gatekeeping of wealth
[22:38:03] <SummerSkies> Fauci was a good example of the corruption of the 'follow the science' mindset
[22:38:04] <TsundereNoises> I hate this whole science-as-religion argument because it's so bad but it's such a fun sounding talking point
[22:38:07] <TsundereNoises> and it's very frustrating
[22:38:10] <SummerSkies> he mind as well have stamped agenda on his forehead
[22:38:26] <SummerSkies> listen to scientists that aren't famous if you want data
[22:38:31] <SummerSkies> not barack obama's buddy
[22:38:36] <Satin> TsundereNoises: because, its existence is real. There is science itself, the scientific method, and the culture they have about trying to reach "the truth" about things
[22:38:40] <emmeka> TsundereNoises I'm not trying to make that point, if anything I'm making the inverse
[22:38:41] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: there can be problems with institutions without that being a problem with the concept of HAVING an institution
[22:38:47] <Satin> and then there is science's role in society, which is intermingled with politics
[22:38:56] <emmeka> TsundereNoises no, there can't.
[22:39:14] <Satin> this is where i side with tsuntsun
[22:39:35] <Satin> I believe the fix is a healthy culture (I'm aware that culture can degrade in 10 years and be misused by fascists again but /shrug)
[22:39:44] <Satin> revolving around those social institutions that science is part of
[22:39:48] <TsundereNoises> I feel like there are so many things I get upset about that it's hard to talk to anyone about, like really in the weeds stuff
[22:39:52] <emmeka> a healthy culture is not a fix for class society
[22:39:53] <TsundereNoises> and that stuff is important
[22:40:03] <TsundereNoises> but it all gets paved over with "science = religion"
[22:40:12] <Satin> emmeka: these can exist in a not-classist society as well you know
[22:40:17] <TsundereNoises> there's a refusal to even engage with nuance here
[22:40:17] <Satin> social prestige, reputation
[22:40:39] <SummerSkies> Satin that is ruined the second somebody lets a bad day shroud their judgement
[22:40:45] <TsundereNoises> in a class-free society you would STILL have people who are experts in one area or another!
[22:41:03] <TsundereNoises> at least if we aren't going primitivist
[22:41:08] <TsundereNoises> and even then...
[22:41:28] <Satin> "authority" isn't bad emmeka.
[22:41:39] <Satin> It's.... potentially bad but it's not inherently bad.
[22:41:56] <SummerSkies> certainly has a low ceiling
[22:42:07] <Satin> ok actually i take what i just said back because it's removing the nuance from his position
[22:42:11] <beaky> high school girls as experts in doing cute things together
[22:42:15] <TsundereNoises> it's possible to agree that it's bad that the vast majority of historians are white dudes and still think that history is worth studying
[22:42:17] <Satin> and dragging it to a more fundamental-topic-argument which i didn't intend
[22:42:22] <TsundereNoises> and I feel like that's analogous to the fight I'm having here
[22:42:28] <Satin> to derail to
[22:42:29] * Satin wishes deleting messages were a thing on irc
[22:43:12] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I like it better that your shame stays public
[22:43:13] <Satin> rather: "authority to strongly suggest what is truth and what actions should be taken for the rest of society isn't bad, it's potentially bad not inherenntly bad"
[22:43:20] <TsundereNoises> because I'd always feel bad about being able to delete dumb shit I say
[22:43:21] <Satin> TsundereNoises: lol
[22:43:32] <emmeka> TsundereNoises ok, to clarify a bit more, I'm not trying to suggest that you're trying to make science a religion or that science in politics is a religion. I'm arguing that instead of grappling with any of the political and social implications of what the actual humans you're suggesting have power would mean, you're just hung up on the fact that they are right and factual.
[22:43:54] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I'd argue that authority to suggest what is true and authority to suggest what actions should be taken should NOT be the same people
[22:44:01] <TsundereNoises> Satin: but that makes me a technocrat
[22:44:24] <emmeka> for example, we had this discussion just yesterday, when it comes to history
[22:44:45] <emmeka> about the history of agriculture in the Americas being inherently eurocentrist or even racist
[22:45:08] <emmeka> now you're saying, historians accredited by the powers that be should have more power to decide the things related to history
[22:45:18] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: and I don't know where you're getting this idea that I've said scientists should make all the politcial decisions comes from
[22:45:30] <TsundereNoises> as I've been saying that's impossible
[22:45:35] <emmeka> I haven't got that idea, nor did I say that.
[22:45:44] <TsundereNoises> and also no
[22:45:47] <emmeka> note the wording, "should have more power", which you did say
[22:46:17] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I think part of the problem is you are treating history like one truth is set in stone, whereas I think history, like EVERY OTHER AREA OF RESEARCH is something where our collective knowledge develops and improves over time
[22:46:37] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I'd say that we are lest eurocentrist NOW than we were in 1800, among academic circles
[22:46:47] <emmeka> sure that's all well and good but I'm not talking about history. I'm talking about historians
[22:46:47] <TsundereNoises> even though we are still far from where we should be
[22:46:50] <Satin> experts aren't bad as long as there's once again, a good healthy culture revolving around there. Is there an avenue for the body of historians to be challenged, even by an amatuer, with different perspectives to shed light on the workings of the past, even from the lens of disadvantaged and the losers?
[22:47:01] <Satin> or is it just used to silence any other narratives
[22:47:16] <Satin> and crush dissent on the subject with their credentials
[22:47:22] <emmeka> Satin answer: there is, and it's the precise thing you're both complaining about and want to stop
[22:47:38] <emmeka> dumb rednecks with twitter having political influence
[22:47:50] <TsundereNoises> I'd argue that a lot of things ARE being challenged these days
[22:48:09] <Satin> I never said dumb rednecks or anything with twitter political influence, but I think most people on twitter don't know what they're talking about
[22:48:14] <TsundereNoises> although one area where I know there isn't enough being challenged, or at least wasn't, was about some stuff with the black death
[22:48:28] <Satin> that doesn't mean I lean towards "only things that these experts said as being trued and being qualified"
[22:48:38] <Satin> I prefer just vaguely saying I prefer educated informed arguments on the matter
[22:48:39] <TsundereNoises> where microbiologists don't listen to the history people enough, history people don't listen to the micro people enough, and everyone sticks to recieved wisdom
[22:48:57] <SummerSkies> I also think that priveleged people with limited understanding of societal function shouldn't be enabled to group up and put power behind the most naive, self destructive views 
[22:48:59] <TsundereNoises> and no, rednecks on twitter are not how I think we challenge that
[22:49:06] <Satin> the masses can be wrong you know, populism is a double edged sword but you already know this
[22:49:08] <TsundereNoises> also I never said dumb rednecks either
[22:49:11] <SummerSkies> which is basically a definition of what happens on twitter
[22:49:19] <TsundereNoises> twitter was re: book publishing anyway
[22:49:28] <Satin> ahhhh such a balancing act, all of this!
[22:49:50] <SummerSkies> you want small businesses
[22:50:24] <TsundereNoises> there's also the concept of the majority deciding they don't like the minority
[22:50:25] <SummerSkies> most of the ideals that form this way are universally shut down by that 
[22:50:27] <TsundereNoises> that can be a rather big problem
[22:50:37] * TsundereNoises whispers and is a place where history repeats itself
[22:50:47] <Satin> sure
[22:50:47] <SummerSkies> you don't want big power in the hands of few, you want medium power in the hands of everyone
[22:51:05] <emmeka> look I myself am guilty of all the thoughts you are having, anytime I hear someone say something stupid about GMOs causing cancer or that we're all gonna be living in vertical farming arcologies or that (insert buzzword here) is going to save the world or rallying cries of SAVE THE BEES, I lose 20 brain cells and want to coup everything and teach the morons what's what
[22:51:09] <TsundereNoises> the concept of protections for the minority from the minority is the whole POINT of government IMO
[22:51:10] <emmeka> but this is not the way.
[22:51:17] <TsundereNoises> protection for the minority from the majority
[22:51:23] <TsundereNoises> but that's not often how things work out in practice

[22:56:07] <S_T_A_N> everything is dead
[22:56:13] <Satin> S_T_A_N: doomer take
[22:56:19] <S_T_A_N> all that we know. All that we are
[22:56:23] <Satin> smh
[22:56:36] <S_T_A_N> it's the only take
[22:56:41] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I mean, I guess I don't feel betrayed, because why would you have expected much
[22:56:42] <SummerSkies> S_T_A_N all that we are is an incredible song by Angels & Airwaves
[22:56:43] <emmeka> I've been on a mission this week. To watch all the Harry Potter movies with my wife. Because she actually hasn't seen a single one of them or read any of the books, because her pentecostal mom didn't want her reading about witchcraft lol
[22:56:43] <S_T_A_N> every other take is denial of reality
[22:56:50] <emmeka> just in time for JK Rowling to get cancelled
[22:56:57] <SummerSkies> didn't they try to cancel her years ago
[22:57:00] <Satin> emmeka: r they fun
[22:57:10] <emmeka> Satin you too?!
[22:57:11] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: I thought Rowling was cancelled years ago
[22:57:15] <Satin> TsundereNoises:  all those volunteers in georgia, Staci Abrams and what not did a lot of legwork
[22:57:20] <Satin> among minority communities and what not
[22:57:24] <emmeka> she was cancelled a bit but now she's gone and done it properly
[22:57:34] <S_T_A_N> emmeka, wdym. JKR was started to cancel years ago and keeps digging the cancel further 
[22:57:46] <TsundereNoises> also I haven't seen any of the movies, I read all the books as they came out, loved the 1st one, loathed the 7th one, some of that may be maturity but some is Rowling getting too big for an editor I think
[22:57:48] <SummerSkies> they tried to cancel joe rogan too
[22:57:53] <Satin> emmeka: no i avoid harry potter entirely and treat it as bad mass art, i'm just asking if you found the movies fun
[22:57:53] <TsundereNoises> the first one was much more polished
[22:58:01] <SummerSkies> his cancellation was cancelled 
[22:58:19] <SummerSkies> it turns out he's too good at grilling elk to be cancelled 
[22:58:20] <Satin> i might watch the movies when i'm bored enough and want to socialize with people someday
[22:58:24] <emmeka> S_T_A_N there's cancelled by random teenagers, and then there's your name being scrubbed from the sequel to your own franchise cancelled
[22:58:25] <TsundereNoises> Satin: yeah and they got NotTrump, but people didn't want to risk voting for someone who would change anything in the primaries
[22:58:38] <S_T_A_N> SummerSkies, he's canceled. Anyone that disagrees is a cuck 
[22:58:39] <ezekielnoob> TsundereNoises tell me about your favorite sandwich
[22:58:42] <Satin> TsundereNoises: but still, biden promised a lot. and he's trying even to be fair
[22:58:46] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: what's the newest JKR fuckup anyway?
[22:58:46] <MootPoot> Satin: I'm still surprised you watched jarhead
[22:58:49] <Satin> TsundereNoises: but the democrats are losers
[22:58:50] <ezekielnoob> i kinda want something with avocado
[22:58:53] <MootPoot> dosen't really sound like your kind of movie
[22:58:54] <Satin> fucking manchin
[22:59:00] <MootPoot> man chinchin
[22:59:01] <Satin> MootPoot: what do you mean doesn't sound like my kind of movie
[22:59:05] <Satin> elaborate
[22:59:07] <SummerSkies> he just had elon musk on for a 3rd time
[22:59:21] <SummerSkies> if joe rogan is cancelled then I'm clint eastwood
[22:59:25] <Satin> MootPoot: and you're right that it wasn't me who mostly picked it, but it was my kind of movie once my (canadian) friend made me watch it
[22:59:26] <MootPoot> Satin: same way tsun wont watch anything that's not yuri
[22:59:33] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I think he's delivering what was really promised: pre-trump status quo
[22:59:35] <S_T_A_N> emmeka, it's funny that you think random teens are the ones canceling her. It's not. It's millennials 
[22:59:37] <Satin> he was mocking me the whole time and saying "lol you wanted a movie about the human condition? here it is"
[22:59:40] <emmeka> TsundereNoises more transphobic shit or something. She was causing a ruckus about the fact that English police apparently record the gender of a rapist as their identified gender, so, she was upset that people with a penis could rape someone and be called a woman on paper.
[22:59:49] <emmeka> which is a very particular thing to care about
[23:00:02] <MootPoot> I mean, jarhead isen't too deep of a investigation about the human condition really
[23:00:07] <Satin> TsundereNoises: I don't think so? some of the stuff in the biden proposals are clearly unprecedented, yes they're not radical and big as much as they should be, but they're pretty substantial for what you can get in this political climate i think
[23:00:10] <TsundereNoises> ezekielnoob: one I invented for myself: Bacon, Avocado, and Tomato, with spicy mayo, it's important to use homemade spicy mayo so you can make it really spicy, and also use a bit of cumin in it
[23:00:31] <ezekielnoob> TsundereNoises what u used to make the tomato spicy
[23:00:31] <Satin> but thanks to morons like manchin, we get 6T spending reduced to 1.4T in the name of fuck all
[23:00:39] <Satin> these are solid things that will benefit people lol
[23:00:50] <ezekielnoob> there was a sircaha bottle in the supermarket but i didn't buy it
[23:00:52] <ezekielnoob> it's too big
[23:01:01] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: unfair! I watch some non-yuri things, I just have to make sure to cleanse myself with comics about awkward gay girls afteward
[23:01:42] <TsundereNoises> emmeka: she's been hugely transphobic several times before though
[23:01:51] <S_T_A_N> ^
[23:01:54] <TsundereNoises> I don't get why it's news

[23:02:00] <Satin> yeah i don't get why it's news either
[23:02:07] <Satin> JK rowling being a TERF is well known
[23:02:09] <S_T_A_N> anyone denying that she was already canceled wasn't paying attention 
[23:02:10] <emmeka> Satin as someone who follows labour politics a bit more than much else in the US, I was really surprised when I read Biden's statement on the Kellogg's strike which basically said "yeah, Kellogg's sux, I'm gonna ban scab labour during strikes, solidarity forever etc"
[23:02:12] <Satin> UK is full of trash on that front
[23:02:28] <Satin> scab labour = ?
[23:02:30] <MootPoot> I'm transphobic - I dont like transitioning from my bed to my work chair
[23:02:45] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot, plz don't
[23:02:45] <TsundereNoises> ezekielnoob: I use dried dundicut peppers and grind them up in my spice grinder (actually a shitty electric coffee grinder that I use only for spices)
[23:02:46] <Satin> emmeka: i'm telling you, regardless of biden's past and what i don't like about him, and his positions on cuba and more
[23:02:56] <Satin> the guy has some solid substantial proposals right now
[23:03:23] <emmeka> Satin gotta get more informed about union issues! a scab is someone who, while a union is on strike, gets a job to replace a striking union worker on the job
[23:03:25] <S_T_A_N> yet he also wants a smooth transition to repayment 
[23:03:25] <Satin> and it's being gridlocked because fuck the democrats, the senate system, and more
[23:03:28] <S_T_A_N> Fuck Biden
[23:03:30] <TsundereNoises> Satin: scabs are people who come in to work to break strikes
[23:03:34] <Satin> emmeka: that's what i guess it meant but that makes sense now more
[23:03:56] <Satin> biden's made great moves with regulation with monopoloies as well (see: lina khan) and other stuff
[23:04:20] <S_T_A_N> Satin, Smooth transition to repayment. Nothing more to say
[23:04:24] <TsundereNoises> but like a lot more union members vote for politicians who explicitly hate unions these days
[23:04:24] <Satin> of course it's frustrating how when someone's trying to do the reasonably right thing given political climate, that they're stopped by some *strong words again for you know who*
[23:04:29] <TsundereNoises> at least in the US
[23:04:47] <Satin> fuck. manchin.
[23:04:55] <Satin> and sinema
[23:05:18] <Satin> and every centrist "moderate" moron democrat standing in the way of real progress for people's lives
[23:05:32] <S_T_A_N> Which includes Biden
[23:05:36] <Satin> i wish the green party had more power here and weren't so single issue based
[23:05:43] <emmeka> also this is a weird channel to do this in, but since we're on the topic and it's the holiday season and fuck scabs, BCTGM is taking donations for their strike fund so like, union workers on strike generally don't starve on the picket line, if you want to donate. https://msha.ke/bctgm/?fbclid=IwAR1h6hOE_hPG2gDNGrAo2Z4QoRSvl24fuOZLkAkMFG0RHhPUlnCOYJ8J4YA#strike-funds

[23:05:47] <Satin> S_T_A_N: as surprising as this is, it doesn't include biden this time
[23:05:51] <Satin> he's the one with the proposals
[23:05:59] <Satin> he's the one with the weirdly-progressive-leaning rethoric
[23:06:05] <TsundereNoises> Satin: except the green party tends to nominate horrible idiots
[23:06:21] <TsundereNoises> Satin: many green party politcians would be worse in other ways than the democrats
[23:06:25] <TsundereNoises> if they had absolute power somehow
[23:06:27] <S_T_A_N> He's not even doing the things he said he would that he has the power to Satin. He's hiding beind the senate to avoid responceability 
[23:06:27] <Satin> TsundereNoises: you're probably right, I'm ignorant about them. I was just reading their wikipedia page yesterday
[23:06:42] <S_T_A_N> He's as bad as the rest
[23:06:47] <Satin> S_T_A_N:  is executive privilege really capable of passing stuff like this?
[23:06:48] <S_T_A_N> Just as we expected
[23:06:53] <S_T_A_N> Just as we said he would be
[23:06:53] <MootPoot> I need to sleep more or something
[23:06:54] <MootPoot> idk
[23:07:00] <Satin> MootPoot: sleep more
[23:07:24] <S_T_A_N> Satin, He can cancel student debt like he said he would without anything from the senate. Instead he wants a "smooth transition to repayment"

[23:09:07] <emmeka> Satin the Green Party is a notorious dumpster fire and has been for decades
[23:09:12] <Satin> :/
[23:09:17] <S_T_A_N> Satin, get his wrinkely cock out of your mouth and look. He's not a champion of anything good, he's an obstacle to it
[23:09:41] <Satin> S_T_A_N: I agree with what I agree with, I can agree with your criticalness of him given his past and all
[23:09:48] <TsundereNoises> and not to bring it back to before, but I think promoting vaccine conspiracies is exactly a problem with not wanting to value the opinions of scientists over Jim Carey
[23:09:57] <Satin> but I'm not overtly cynical when I see what I think is solid pushes
[23:10:07] <Satin> and i've seen what's included in those proposals

[23:10:38] <Satin> emmeka: calm
[23:10:39] <TsundereNoises> I wish I had that optimism
[23:10:59] <Satin> i mean, michigan planned monopoly hospital merger
[23:11:12] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, that's the point. Make it look good to win over people too blind to see that what he's doing is actually nothing
[23:11:13] <Satin> immediatly was put into pearl
[23:11:15] <Satin> peril
[23:11:18] <TsundereNoises> this is dumb, but I feel like "wisdom" in anything political, tends to be a buzzword that means bullshit
[23:11:18] <Satin> wtf is that weord
[23:11:24] <emmeka> anyone who gets to that position through the party also knows that it's a party that is fundamentally built to fight against anything that meaningfully challenges the status quo
[23:11:25] <TsundereNoises> even when I agree with the point
[23:11:50] <TsundereNoises> S_T_A_N: well that's the thing, it's not NOTHING, like it would absolutely be worse under Trump
[23:12:00] <Satin> emmeka: i'm aware, and I'm saying fuck the democrats too, but I'm not also that cynical to the point where I can't recognize and acknowledge clear moves by someone to try to better or change things
[23:12:11] <TsundereNoises> just it's not anywhere remotely approaching enough, and I can't even feel that it's the best that could be done
[23:12:41] <Satin> fundamentally I don't think the democrats are any different than the republicans or anything like that, both neoliberal status quo maintaining smhucks but hey
[23:12:51] <TsundereNoises> Satin: I have had this cycle all my life of getting excited during the primaries only for my candidate to lose terribly
[23:12:53] <Satin> (only difference rly on specific social issues)
[23:12:58] <TsundereNoises> and then hold my nose and vote for someone I mostly hate
[23:13:25] <TsundereNoises> Satin: and yet, it's so hard to get people to care or vote in primaries or midterms, and when they do it's so hard to get them to vote based on issues rather than name recognition
[23:13:25] <Satin> TsundereNoises: understandable yeah
[23:13:32] <Satin> yeah
[23:13:41] <emmeka> I remember being at an Occupy Wall St camp this side of the border (though I went to the one in NYC too), and there was an NDPer (our left wing party) up talking during a general assembly, making all sorts of promises as they do. And this guy I knew, a Serbian anarchist, he leans over to me and says "these fuckin' NDPers, man. Their heart, in the right place. But their balls? Nah, nah."
[23:13:47] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, it's treading water rather than dragging us down sure. But meanwhile a shark is still swimming ever closer while they don't do a single thing about it
[23:14:06] <emmeka> and that line's stuck with me ever since.
[23:14:18] <Satin> emmeka: occupy wallstreet was gamed by the FBI, no secret rly
[23:14:25] <TsundereNoises> S_T_A_N: I agree with that completely, I just do feel that treading water is at least worth doing rather than NOT doing
[23:14:31] <emmeka> Satin no need, it gamed itself.
[23:14:35] <Satin> lmao
[23:14:51] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, and that is why we are doomed. 
[23:14:55] <TsundereNoises> fair
[23:15:07] <Satin> same tsun
[23:15:14] <TsundereNoises> but this was actually kind of the heart of what I was thinking about earlier
[23:15:16] <MootPoot> emmeka: why and how do you know a serbian anarchist is my question
[23:15:25] <emmeka> Satin but the moral of this story is, ask yourself. Even if you think Biden's heart is in the right place, are his balls in the right place? No. His balls are stuck in the Democratic Party machine.
[23:15:26] <TsundereNoises> it's really hard to get a significant majority of people to even attempt to engage
[23:15:28] <Satin> we'll be jesus and eventually jump onto the lifeboat stan
[23:15:29] <Satin> don't worry
[23:15:32] <emmeka> MootPoot why wouldn't I
[23:15:37] <TsundereNoises> in terms of thinking about what their policy opinions even should be
[23:15:44] <TsundereNoises> not even "agree with me" just to even CARE
[23:16:05] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: yeah, if you asked "who is friends with a Serbian anarchist" it's either emmeka or urchin
[23:16:07] <Satin> emmeka: I don't disagree with that, and I'm all to painfully aware of that. I don't however, agree with overt cynicism that nothing can be done.
[23:16:14] <S_T_A_N> who the fuck is stan. I am S_T_A_N Satin 
[23:16:27] <Satin> as disgusting as incremental change is, I'll take solid moves to try to change things

[23:33:27] <Satin> yeah
[23:33:37] <MootPoot> well - for me its a way to get cold coffee without the calories
[23:33:42] <MootPoot> and without the shits
[23:33:50] <Satin> but it has taurine and other bullshit
[23:33:56] <MootPoot> sure, I can try pills but
[23:33:57] <Satin> it'll cause kidney stones eventually with lots of it

[23:34:39] <Satin> MootPoot: calm
[23:35:00] <Satin> MootPoot: i only started drinking alcohol since my birthday in late oct
[23:35:05] <emmeka> why not just drink coffee
[23:35:07] <Satin> and i've already gone through an entire box of truly hard seltzer
[23:35:08] <Satin> s
[23:35:11] <Satin> and a fireball
[23:35:12] <emmeka> it's cheaper, and will satisfy the addiction
[23:35:21] <Satin> i'll uh, chill with the alcohol for now i think, haven't actually tried other stuff
[23:35:23] <SummerSkies> i need to quit coffee for a minute
[23:35:27] * Satin 22 years of drought
[23:35:36] <TsundereNoises> yeah just drink coffee with no milk or sugar
[23:35:38] <MootPoot> emmeka: coffee shits , and coffee takes time to prep
[23:35:48] <MootPoot> and canned coffee is shit
[23:35:52] <Satin> MootPoot: also my liver got lacerated by one of the bullets and i know it's been regenerating
[23:35:53] <emmeka> but for cold coffee you can prep it in advance
[23:35:56] <Satin> so not pushing the alcohol ig
[23:35:56] <emmeka> for significantly cheaper
[23:36:02] <MootPoot> emmeka: you think we have the foresight for that
[23:36:21] <TsundereNoises> in summer I keep 2 rotating pitchers of cold brew, when one empties I start the new one and start steeping the old one again
[23:36:27] <emmeka> think of all the stupid random amazon purchases you could make with the money you save!
[23:36:31] <Satin> I'm going to make a very embarassing confession
[23:36:35] <Satin> i don't know how to make coffee

[23:36:52] <MootPoot> we coffee people are welcoming to you
[23:36:52] <emmeka> Satin buy a coffee maker. follow manual.
[23:36:54] <SummerSkies> Satin there's so many new ways to make it that it's not that expected anymore
[23:36:56] <MootPoot> unlike those tea people
[23:36:58] <emmeka> if you need the basic route.
[23:37:00] <SummerSkies> i learned a keurig before an actual coffee machine
[23:37:02] <MootPoot> fuck tea people
[23:37:04] <MootPoot> in the ass
[23:37:13] <SummerSkies> im sure there still some coffee machines i dont have figured out
[23:37:16] <TsundereNoises> SummerSkies: what did "learning" a keurig entail?
[23:37:23] <Satin> MootPoot: caffine is bad for ptsd so i'm naturally whenever i think of "the better solution" thinking of tea
[23:37:25] <SummerSkies> nothing but even still
[23:37:29] <Satin> ofc i drink caffine anyways because i'm dumb but you know
[23:37:39] <SummerSkies> TsundereNoises: that basically meant i knew how to make coffee before i knew how to make coffee
[23:37:42] <SummerSkies> i still had to learn 
[23:37:47] <Satin> MootPoot: it's crazy, a few redbulls in while driving and i'll be fucking nervous over any small thing

[23:38:13] <MootPoot> and kalm down
[23:38:20] <SummerSkies> my favorite way to make coffee now is press the button at the gas station because they have the best coffee i know about
[23:38:23] <TsundereNoises> it's hard to hug a big dog while driving though
[23:38:26] <TsundereNoises> despite what many dogs think
[23:38:28] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: weak
[23:38:29] <SummerSkies> beantown brand from traverse city michigan 
[23:38:38] <Satin> it's not THAT bad usually, but i also had a day last week while i had 0 caffine and had constant had tremors/jitters even when lying still
[23:38:47] <Satin> stupid brains, i tell you
[23:39:03] <SummerSkies> i've broken my dependency for caffeine before
[23:39:12] <MootPoot> Satin: do you still have like - issues being around guns
[23:39:13] <SummerSkies> coffee is just so fuckin good when you start drinking it again that it starts all over again
[23:39:15] <Satin> opinions on green tea?
[23:39:18] <MootPoot> if you see one
[23:39:19] <emmeka> Satin but if you're asking how to make coffee with a drip coffee maker, it's pretty easy. You fill it up with water. You put a coffee filter in the basket, open side facing up (except certain ones which have like a washable steel mesh thing instead). You put the coffee in the coffee filter. You press the start button.
[23:39:23] <MootPoot> Satin: trash
[23:39:32] <emmeka> you could figure it out in all of 20 seconds
[23:39:34] <MootPoot> all tea is trash
[23:39:36] <SummerSkies> lol coffee lesson all in one message nice
[23:39:45] <Satin> MootPoot: no, not per se, but I was watching that movie yesterday and my friend didn't realize it but I was at least extra self aware with a scene where there's lots of guns firing while they're training and crawling in the mud
[23:39:59] <MootPoot> yeah but that's a movie - I mean IRL
[23:40:00] <emmeka> MootPoot please repent for your blasphemy against the teachings of our lord and saviour, beaky.

[23:40:55] <MootPoot> well, have you seen it? 
[23:40:58] <TsundereNoises> Satin: to use a pour over cone you heat water in a kettle (preferably a long neck kettle but whatever works), put a filter in the cone, put a couple scoops of coffee in the filter, then pour hot water over it and into a cup
[23:41:03] <MootPoot> like - I know your brain is fine with it

[23:43:12] <emmeka> Satin I guess the only thing that'd take figuring out is that you need fine grind for espresso, and coarse grind for cold press/French press stuff. Regular medium grind (ie, normal prepackaged preground coffee) is for drip/perc coffeemakers.
[23:43:15] <Satin> this doesn't change my broad political positions at all that gun control is important yada yada

[23:43:48] <Satin> why is that
[23:44:02] <TsundereNoises> Satin: soon you'll be claiming that people are preventing home invasions every other day and that we should be arming all teachers to reduce school shootings

[23:44:08] <Satin> TsundereNoises: no lol
[23:44:14] <emmeka> I think gun ownership is a very huge risk that usually doesn't make a lot of sense and that nobody should do unless they have to
[23:44:18] <MootPoot> S_T_A_N: only butter is allowed to see ecchi pics of my sticks

[23:44:34] <emmeka> and I don't think you should buy into the yankee notion of guns being freedom wands that protect you from danger
[23:44:38] <Satin> emmeka: I live in the US, we do have ways for responsible gun ownership
[23:44:46] <emmeka> they are nothing more than very dangerous tools.

[23:45:10] <TsundereNoises> but that's not the main use case for guns here
[23:45:14] <emmeka> TsundereNoises right, that's the "if they have to" part.
[23:45:18] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: FUCK john Deere amIrite
[23:45:29] <emmeka> hunters and people who are occasionally faced with marauding bears need them

[23:49:30] <Satin> gun culture just isn't the same there
[23:49:37] <amigojapan> Good morning
[23:49:43] <Satin> no one waving around signposts demanding guns be widespread or anything
[23:49:44] <TsundereNoises> morning amigo
[23:49:47] <Satin> morning amigo
[23:49:48] <S_T_A_N> I mean I think it's easy to make a clear distinction between most firearms and stuff like grenade launchers, nukes, and anthrax. 
[23:50:09] <Satin> S_T_A_N: but the argument people use of it being part of a militia that will keep the government in check
[23:50:10] <S_T_A_N> A very clear understanding of why that's the line
[23:50:11] <Satin> is ridiculous
[23:50:15] <TsundereNoises> S_T_A_N: I don't agree, people take an absolutist approach here that any rights to own weapons are protected
[23:50:26] <Satin> TsundereNoises: really? lol
[23:50:27] <Satin> wtf
[23:50:39] <TsundereNoises> I know that's a crazy extreme no one agrees with, but that's my point, drawing a line there vs. under rifles that shoot a certain amount of rounds per second
[23:50:43] <TsundereNoises> what's the difference?
[23:50:51] <TsundereNoises> in terms of legal theory
[23:50:54] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: morning
[23:50:56] <Satin> utility?
[23:51:02] <Satin> one can be used for self defense and so on
[23:51:03] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, There is a clear reason for that being the line. People can cry all they want about it but the line already exists 
[23:51:06] <Satin> the other is just...war weapons
[23:51:26] <MootPoot> I give up
[23:51:27] <MootPoot> I've lost
[23:51:31] <Satin> what
[23:51:33] <TsundereNoises> Satin: why do machineguns count as self defense and not war weapons?
[23:51:36] <TsundereNoises> that's my point
[23:51:44] <S_T_A_N> MootPoot, losing is half the battle
[23:51:45] <Satin> machinguns are def not self defense
[23:51:53] <TsundereNoises> S_T_A_N: the line doesn't exist though, this is a fuzzy issue
[23:51:56] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I think people have the right to have arms
[23:51:59] <MootPoot> I lost at office jeoparty for christmas
[23:52:04] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, okay. Go buy a nuke
[23:52:05] <MootPoot> all teh questions are fucking boomer ones
[23:52:07] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: and legs
[23:52:13] <TsundereNoises> S_T_A_N: I think you're missing my point
[23:52:19] <SummerSkies> me and my buddy are taking our AR-15s to the range on sunday
[23:52:21] <MootPoot> like who wrote X christmas song
[23:52:42] <Satin> I've stopped thinking in terms of universalist notions like that amigojapan 
[23:52:47] <TsundereNoises> S_T_A_N: I'm saying that basically no sane person would argue that I should be able to go buy a nuke, but why is the line THERE rather than, say, a limit on what the fire rate of an automatic rifle can be
[23:52:49] <TsundereNoises> legally
[23:52:50] <Satin> I don't think citizens in every country have the right to be arms or anything
[23:52:59] <SummerSkies> Satin that is smart
[23:53:01] <Satin> maybe we americans do, with our history, constitution and stuff
[23:53:04] <MootPoot> I want to be a cute girl arm
[23:53:15] <SummerSkies> even though I will use it in much different context
[23:53:16] <amigojapan> Satin: it was a joke, I don't actually approve of weapons
[23:53:19] <Satin> but japanese culture, citizens, and the way their system works, no, not necessarily
[23:53:22] <Satin> amigojapan: i see
[23:53:26] <SummerSkies> the idea of ditching attempts at universal notions is a good idea
[23:53:26] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I only want a cute girl arm if I can be a cute girl all over
[23:53:34] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, acting like you can't understand why that's the line is disingenuous. 
[23:53:55] <TsundereNoises> S_T_A_N: I'm not, and I can't tell if you're deliberately misunderstanding or just not getting what I'm trying to say
[23:54:07] <amigojapan> Satin: I meant arms and legs
[23:54:09] <Satin> SummerSkies: I mean, I think it's a balancing act. You have to have nuance, and ditch universalist notions which are bad, but not abandon truths that can apply everywhere either
[23:54:12] <Satin> amigojapan: oh lol
[23:54:21] <TsundereNoises> S_T_A_N: at least in the US, one of the big arguments against most kinds of reasonable firearms regulation is the legal framework because of the 2nd amendment
[23:54:22] <MootPoot> TsundereNoises: the difference is usually one weapon is designed for engaging cities, and the other for personel one at a time
[23:54:34] <TsundereNoises> (Which has only been interpreted that way relatively recently by the way)
[23:54:38] <MootPoot> the scale of the engagement is the line
[23:54:38] <Satin> SummerSkies: in philosophy, the postmodernists are the ones the most regarded for being anti-grand-narratives
[23:54:39] <SummerSkies> Satin: well the reason I lit up to the idea of that is because of just how much universalist notions are used
[23:54:44] <Satin> the legacy is mixed
[23:54:52] <Satin> SummerSkies: that's fair and very true
[23:54:59] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: we have a RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS!
[23:55:03] <SummerSkies> it's the only thing i fuckin see really
[23:55:06] <MootPoot> I WANT TO BEAR ARMS
[23:55:07] <TsundereNoises> the argument against most regulation is that that is unlimited
[23:55:09] <TsundereNoises> legally
[23:55:18] <TsundereNoises> so the question is, can there be a legal limit
[23:55:19] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, and yet there is plenty of reasonable regulation already in place. And there can be more, but yes some dumbs are trying to stand in the way of that
[23:55:22] <TsundereNoises> and the answer is obviously yes
[23:55:23] <TsundereNoises> that's my point
[23:55:29] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, there already is one. 
[23:55:37] <MootPoot> well, I mean in like morality  for the "war weapon vs personal weapon" thing TsundereNoises 
[23:55:47] <MootPoot> not the legalities of the constiution
[23:55:51] <Satin> SummerSkies: people are quick to want to discover universalist notions without realizing you can even "create" philosophy that is relevant to a certain time/era and its conditions as well
[23:55:56] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: did not have a bad dream today. But I think I woke up because of waking up yesterday
[23:56:03] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I'm exclusively talking about legal theory
[23:56:09] <Satin> there's a lot that is malleable about human socities and how they're organized
[23:56:14] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: frankly "morality" is irrelevant to the right to bear arms anyway IMO
[23:56:21] <S_T_A_N> Anyway I am 100% for abolishing the 2nd amendment and figuring it out from there, but not even the most die hard gun control people are willing to push that far
[23:56:31] <TsundereNoises> MootPoot: I don't think you have a moral obligation to own or not own guns, you have a moral obligation to not murder people
[23:56:37] <TsundereNoises> regulations are a practical thing
[23:56:39] <S_T_A_N> which is why these debates will NEVER end
[23:56:53] <SummerSkies> the 2nd amendment is immortal my friend
[23:56:57] <MootPoot> for the legal theory - I'm actually okay with people having the ability to own nukes
[23:57:01] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: yeah, sometimes your sleepschedule gets screwed up like that
[23:57:01] <Satin> i won't use my gun, when i get one, to murder people
[23:57:03] <Satin> trust me
[23:57:06] <S_T_A_N> SummerSkies, naw. It can be abolished 
[23:57:10] <SummerSkies> you're trying to clean earth off of earth
[23:57:16] <MootPoot> good luck getting one though 
[23:57:18] <S_T_A_N> On a technical sense if not a practical one
[23:57:19] <SummerSkies> just throwing grass in the air 
[23:57:30] <amigojapan> S_T_A_N: I feel there is a short of deification of the founding fathers
[23:57:33] <TsundereNoises> S_T_A_N: the 2nd amendment being about not restricting firearms is a very recent interpretation
[23:57:34] <Satin> MootPoot: i might live in new mexico but my drivers license, car and so on is in missouri
[23:57:40] <Satin> MootPoot: missouri is one of the most lenient
[23:57:46] <Satin> conceal carry everywhere
[23:57:48] <TsundereNoises> "well regulated militia" used to be an important phrase
[23:57:50] <TsundereNoises> WELL REGULATED
[23:58:08] <Satin> Summary of Missouri Gun Laws. Missouri is a permitless carry state as well as a shall-issue state. However, permits are issued for reciprocity purposes, at the local level by county sheriffs. There is no permit, background check or firearms registration required when buying a handgun from a private individual."
[23:58:10] <Satin> "
[23:58:33] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, You already said that. And I made my point that as long as we focus on fighting about if you can regulate with the 2nd or not we get nowhere. Abolish the 2nd is step 1
[23:58:56] <MootPoot> given how the US is - that's never gonna happen
[23:58:58] <TsundereNoises> S_T_A_N: that's crazy talk, abolishing amendments is EXTREMELY difficult
[23:58:58] <SummerSkies> what goes into the abolishment

[23:59:05] <SummerSkies> confiscation, by any chance?
[23:59:06] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: well I would love to get up at 5am every day. But I really really doubt this is permanent
[23:59:07] <TsundereNoises> even if a majority wanted to
[23:59:08] <Satin> TsundereNoises: it shouldn't be
[23:59:23] <TsundereNoises> Satin: why not, that's the entire point of constitutional amendment
[23:59:25] <Satin> other countries change their constitution more rgeularly
[23:59:40] <Satin> there's no reason why it should be insanely difficult to do that
[23:59:43] <TsundereNoises> SummerSkies: no, they were talking about changing a law
[23:59:46] <Satin> times change
[23:59:46] <S_T_A_N> TsundereNoises, as long as it's treated that way you are gith
[23:59:49] <S_T_A_N> right*
[23:59:49] <SummerSkies> alright alright
[23:59:57] <SummerSkies> TsundereNoises: that simply means this is one of the less extreme cases
