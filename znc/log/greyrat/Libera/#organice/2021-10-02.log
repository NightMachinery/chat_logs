[08:09:27] <macnewb2> is there a way to achieve something like this https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/tracking-habits.html#org5cf84e0 on organice?

[10:53:58] <s6xtyn9ine> munen: i was macnewb2, just logged in from a different device.
[10:54:32] <s6xtyn9ine> as i asked previously, is https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/tracking-habits.html#org5cf84e0 a thing?
[10:54:44] <s6xtyn9ine> btw, sorry for all the disconnects
[10:57:21] <munen> Ah, Welcome back, then^^
[10:57:48] <munen> No worries about the disconnects. This is IRC, connecting to a channel isnâ€™t necessarily permanent(;
[10:58:38] <munen> You can track habits in organice in so far as that organice understands the habit specific time stamps.
[10:59:24] <munen> So, if you have todos already set up from Emacs, or you hand craft the time stamp in organice, the habits will shop up in your agenda.
[10:59:48] <s6xtyn9ine> oh cool
[10:59:50] <munen> However, the agenda doesnâ€™t have a colorful view as Emacs does to review them.
[11:00:07] <s6xtyn9ine> yea, noticed that
[11:00:11] <munen> So, personally, I use organice to track the habits and Emacs to look at the graph.
[11:00:33] <munen> However, someone could change the agenda to do some more analytics and also show the colored graph.
[11:00:45] <s6xtyn9ine> good idea
