[00:33:07] <NotThatRPG> Does anyone have code for archiving done items "with exceptions"? What I had in mind was setting a property on TODO items that I want to keep and then auto-archiving all done items that do *not* have that property. This seems like a common sort of thing to want to do, so I was wondering if anyone had already done it.

[00:40:10] <Demosthenex> NotThatRPG: i never archive. archive takes my TREE and makes it FLAT. 
[00:40:17] <Demosthenex> if i archive, i cut/paste out items manually
[00:41:13] <Demosthenex> i only know to set the archive file.
[00:41:25] <NotThatRPG> I have a personal task org file that is pretty much flat (with some exceptions, which is one of the reasons I would exclude tasks from the auto-archiving).
[00:41:52] <NotThatRPG> @Demosthenex: It's not a huge task of elisp programming, but I thought I would ask before doing it myself.
[00:42:53] <Demosthenex> you might look at the archive code then, see if there's a flag ;]
[00:42:59] <Demosthenex> like :COMMENT: prevents export

[19:29:06] <Demosthenex> arg. blind. i wish every g***Dmtn gui app didn't popup with a giant BLIND white screen, before going black. here's looking at you firefox
[19:40:12] <tecosaur> Today's TMiO post was inspired by me stumbling across Confluence Wiki Markdown and being unable to tell if it was accidentally or intentionally bad 😛

[19:51:16] <tecosaur> their block opening tags are identical to the closing tags
[19:51:24] <tecosaur> if you want meter^3 you have to write meter{^3^}
[19:51:38] <tecosaur> !!!
[19:52:07] <Demosthenex> sad
[19:52:25] <Demosthenex> prolly some windoze using mouse loving devops cloud webdev fanboi made it
[19:52:42] <Demosthenex> hrm, how much more could i throw into that
[19:52:54] <tecosaur> I'd put it 50/50 between that and a bored intern
[19:53:14] <Demosthenex> or an outsourced company
[19:54:03] <Demosthenex> tecosaur: https://dpaste.org/oJxk
[19:54:22] <Demosthenex> if i wrote that and distributed it to customers, i'd be eternally embarrassed and mortified
[19:54:28] <tecosaur> what on earth am I looking at?
[19:54:37] <Demosthenex> a shell script from ibm.
[19:54:40] <Demosthenex> well, a piece
[19:54:59] <tecosaur> Oh.
[19:55:06] <Demosthenex> best script money could buy

[19:55:24] <Demosthenex> this isn't an april fools joke either ;]
[19:57:34] <tecosaur> I am consistently amazed by the fact that big corporations pay for teams of people to produce worse results than a completely unfunded enthusiast OSS project
[19:57:59] <Demosthenex> tecosaur: because you can be paid to do a bad job, if you have talent you don't publish unless it's good enough to be proud of
[19:58:36] <Demosthenex> really, i wish i knew how to find companies that wanted actual talent
[19:58:53] <tecosaur> It's just really nice whenever I see a high-quality OSS project, done by enthusiasts
[19:59:00] <Demosthenex> absolutely.
[19:59:04] <Demosthenex> which is why i use freebsd.
[19:59:21] <tecosaur> Have not used, but I have got a good impression
[19:59:44] <Demosthenex> imagine linux if the base OS (kernel and core binaries) were 1 codebase from the same team
[20:00:03] <Demosthenex> now, run all the same stuff you use on linux on top of that. tada.
[20:00:49] <Demosthenex> i migrated about 3 months ago. never been so happy to be systemd free
[20:01:03] <Demosthenex> first time in AGES i could use an installer and just check a few boxes during install.
[20:01:11] <Demosthenex> vs building gentoo from scratch
[20:02:56] <tecosaur> I'd love to see seL4 grow into a usable OS
[20:03:25] <tecosaur> ( usable as a desktop OS )
