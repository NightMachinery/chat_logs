[00:55:53] <relipse> How can I write a php program/function which does what this website is doing: https://epsg.io/transform#s_srs=2284&t_srs=4326
[00:56:33] <stenno> you.. just write it?
[00:56:37] <stenno> do you have a specific question?
[00:56:44] <stenno> do you need the algorithm?
[00:56:53] *** Quits: pulse (~pulse@user/pulse) (Quit: Join our community of creative supermutants at https://indiedevs.net/)
[01:01:25] <relipse> yeah i need an algorithm
[01:01:49] <stenno> the algorithm of converting one coordinate system into another?
[01:02:06] <stenno> that is really not a php question at all
[01:02:25] <relipse> yes
[01:03:03] <relipse> i realize that it's not a php question
[01:03:10] <relipse> except that I want the answer in php
[01:03:43] <stenno> relipse: https://github.com/maptiler/epsg.io
[01:08:22] <__adrian> there's no "answer in php." if you want php code, then look for a library (might start on packagist) or hire someone.
[01:10:18] <stenno> you can read the above source code and port the algorithms used
[01:10:29] <stenno> if there is no library like that already
[01:13:36] <stenno> coordinate transformation sounds like some funky matrix stuff
[01:14:05] <stenno> like you would take a coordinate vector, multiply it with a matrix
[01:14:09] <stenno> transformation matrix
[01:14:35] <stenno> learning about transformation matrices was probably the coolest math stuff i ever learned

[03:03:12] *** Quits: luigibu (~luigibu@80.30.201.209) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[03:03:55] <Blondie101010> Sal`:  not without seeing your code
[03:04:04] <Sammitch> probably bad scope. eg: `$a=100; function foo() { echo $a; }; foo()` will produce the describe behaviour. but show your code to know for sure.
[03:04:54] <Blondie101010> including html sounds like a beginner's mistake
[03:05:16] <Blondie101010> !+php first
[03:05:16] <php-bot> your PHP code can be sorted into two categories: code which _performs work_ (processing input, controller logic, database access, error handling, etc.), and code which  _produces output_ (header(), echo, <?= $var ?>, plain ol' <html>, etc.). work goes FIRST. output goes LAST. https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/9ed2542a695e2ebe30aa
[03:05:18] <Sal`> no function, just including html with a <?php echo $a; ?>
[03:05:41] <Blondie101010> Sal`:  is it in the same execution?
[03:05:55] <Sammitch> telepathy currently offline, please post code.
[03:06:08] <Sal`> there's no way i can post an include
[03:06:23] <Sal`> if you tell me how to do it, I will post it
[03:06:24] <Blondie101010> each HTTP request calls a new php script instance
[03:06:37] <Sal`> no, it's on the same page
[03:06:41] <Blondie101010> I suspect you're expecting variables to survive across requests
[03:06:47] <Blondie101010> same page means nothing
[03:06:53] <Sal`> same request
[03:07:14] <Sal`> it's a view calling for an "sub-view" containing a menu

[03:11:09] <Blondie101010> ok enough!
[03:11:26] <Sal`> ok, sorry, i just saw your post
[03:11:52] <Blondie101010> you apparently know how to copy-paste, so copy-paste text
[03:11:53] <__adrian> Sal`: do you _always_ need that file to be included?
[03:12:36] <Sal`> __adrian, yes
[03:12:44] <__adrian> then why are you using require_once ?
[03:13:23] <Sal`> just one more precaution
[03:13:34] <__adrian> precaution for what? for doing the thing you want?
[03:13:54] <__adrian> if you _always_ want it to happen, why would you _prevent_ it from happening more than once?
[03:14:56] <Sal`> no, sorry, for "more than once" I meant one in every view

[03:18:38] <Sal`> ok
[03:18:39] <__adrian> well, for starters, if the code in question is inside a class then yes, it's out of scope.

[05:49:52] <Sal`> this is error I get: " Error! [8] Undefined variable: aaa @ C:\wamp64\www\site\application\views\common\navigation.php (16)"
[05:50:31] <Sal`> the construction of the message is because of the error class
[05:50:41] <__adrian> so that does tell me one useful thing, which is that you're not looking at the actual error message.
[05:50:44] <__adrian> you should be
[05:50:51] <Blondie101010> indeed
[05:51:01] <Blondie101010> that is not the real error for sure
[05:51:01] <Sal`> !
[05:51:38] <Sal`> wait, let me get the php erro output
[05:51:52] <Blondie101010> Sal`:  please show me in 5-10 lines how to get an undefined variable to cause a fatal error
[05:51:56] <__adrian> to be clear, it might be accurate, but you shouldn't be relying on that. there's zero need/benefit to reformatting error messages.
[05:52:31] <Blondie101010> PHP messages are very structured
[05:52:37] <Blondie101010> that is not a PHP error
[05:52:42] <__adrian> projects generally don't need any special error handling. set up error reporting and logging in your ini file. that's it.
[05:54:00] <__adrian> *most projects
[05:56:18] <Sal`> __adrian, I'm using this
[05:56:19] <Sal`> https://controlc.com/1b1c84df
[05:57:06] <Sal`> then the log class sends e-mails with errors
[05:57:20] <Sal`> and logs on file too
[05:57:51] <__adrian> yeah. !+error logging
[05:57:51] <php-bot> yeah., In addition to configuring error reporting (/msg php-bot error reporting), set log_errors=1 and error_log=/path/to/your/error.log in your php.ini file. This allows you to simply tail the log to see errors, and to disable display_errors (e.g., during production).

[06:32:36] <onichomp> is there any way to get the mysql result string after a $pdo->execute operation?
[06:32:46] <onichomp> like, the string that says ¨MySQL returned an empty result set (i.e. zero rows). (Query took 0.0036 seconds.) ¨
[06:35:43] <__adrian> that's from the mysql cli client, not the DB itself.
[06:35:46] <ss23> I don't think so. I believe that is just something coming from the client, not the server
[06:35:52] <ss23> You could write the code to do it yourself I'm sure :)
[06:36:45] <__adrian> you could do  ->exec('set profiling=1'); ->query(...); ->query('show profiling');  apparently (i've never tried this)
[06:40:17] <onichomp> mmm, maybe theres an easier way to get around this trouble, i have a pdo that executes an insert query without any error but it doesnt insert anything
[06:41:13] <__adrian> you should configure logging on your DB
[06:41:48] <__adrian> i'd guess the record already exists and you're not treating that as an error
[06:42:14] <onichomp> no, it doesnt exists, and all the other queries work fine
[06:42:21] <onichomp> maybe something in my syntax?
[06:42:36] <__adrian> a syntax error is not something you can ignore
[06:42:48] <__adrian> to be clear, are you checking for errors?
[06:42:55] <onichomp> https://litter.catbox.moe/o9s5n0.jpg
[06:43:23] <__adrian> to be clear, are you checking for errors?
[06:43:28] <onichomp> well... if it had an error it should crash or something, right?
[06:43:37] <__adrian> ...
[06:44:03] <onichomp> wait i saw something
[06:44:12] <__adrian> you need to either check for errors, or you need to configure PDO to throw an exception when there's an error
[06:44:23] <__adrian> recommend the latter. !+pdo_mysql connect
[06:44:23] <php-bot> recommend the latter., How to use PDO to connect to MySQL: https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/385c6830ba2932bc36a2
[06:45:07] <__adrian> also, you don't bindParam()  _and_ pass data via execute(). one or the other. the other, in this case.
[06:45:26] <onichomp> nevermind, i found the error
[06:45:35] <onichomp> i was giving the execute two paremeters
[06:45:42] <__adrian> you're also execute()ing with two values and only have one parameter
[06:45:44] <onichomp> and i was only using one in the query
[06:45:45] <__adrian> right
[06:46:01] <__adrian> see link above. you should throw
[06:46:02] <onichomp> damn, sorry to bothering you with that simple error :(
[06:46:14] <__adrian> no problem, you got several bits of good advice
[06:46:28] <__adrian> do you know the difference between  bindParam() and bindValue() ?
[06:47:02] <onichomp> no, to be honest I just ¨learned¨ php like 2 weeks ago
[06:47:04] <onichomp> im going to check it
[06:47:13] <__adrian> if you don't know, then _don't use_ bindParam().
[06:47:49] <__adrian> more generally, just pass data via execute().
[06:50:00] <onichomp> so, just preparing and execute without binding values/params?
[06:50:15] <__adrian> !+pdo_mysql prepare
[06:50:15] <php-bot> How to prepare a statement using PDO: https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/1ddd71511e01c1f609db
[06:50:40] <__adrian> use execute(). there are some cases where you'll need to bind, but if you don't know, then you don't need.
[06:51:15] <__adrian> similarly, if you don't REALLY KNOW you NEED to bindParam() instead of bindValue() and CAN'T THINK OF ANOTHER WAY, then you don't need to.
[06:53:10] <onichomp> well, so far im ok with using bindParam() and has been working fine until now
[06:53:15] <onichomp> thanks for the help
[06:53:37] <__adrian> if you don't know the difference, how do you know it's working fine?
[06:53:40] <__adrian> welcome
[06:53:52] <onichomp> the only problem was that f*ck up with the two params during execute function, thanks
[06:54:19] <__adrian> well, that wasn't the only thing you found (and hopefully fixed)
[06:54:43] <__adrian> you were binding _and_ passing data via execute(). this is confusing at best.
[06:55:03] <__adrian> you didn't know how to pay attention to errors from the DB, which hopefully you now do.
[06:55:12] <__adrian> these are good things to have learned

[07:26:31] <__adrian> boobie: extensions are MEANINGLESS. do not use that script. it is very insecure.
[07:26:47] <boobie> its ok its just for my friends its behind a password
[07:26:48] <__adrian> i'll brb; i'm sure someone can help you learn about mime types
[07:27:50] <boobie> its not on a public sit
[07:27:51] <boobie> e
[07:34:54] <Blondie101010> are you creating the file name based on user input?
[07:36:08] <boobie> yes but its just me and 5 friends that i know in real life
[07:36:14] <boobie> so im not afraid they will try to hack it
[07:36:33] <boobie> also it wouldnt matter much its just a raspberry pi with nothing else on it than a little place where we share books
[07:37:00] <boobie> so if you could explain to me how the if or else works i would be happy
[07:37:21] <__adrian> boobie: none of those are valid arguments against just doing it the right way in the first place. but - if you're so not-worried, then why are you checking at all?
[07:37:21] <boobie> i have far too little knowledge of php to do anything advanced
[07:37:25] <Blondie101010> I'd suggest you try to improve it by placing the user input name in a DB and select a semi-random filename
[07:37:51] <Blondie101010> that way you do not need to worry about any security constraints in the name
[07:38:11] <__adrian> https://php.net/finfo
[07:38:24] <__adrian> this will allow you to check what the file type actually is, regardless of name
[07:38:49] <Blondie101010> that's the least of my worries
[07:39:06] <__adrian> and i'd recommend throwing an exception rather than echoing a message or exiting.
[07:39:16] <Blondie101010> I men it deserves to be addressed but it's not what will get them hacked
[07:39:24] <__adrian> no, agreed
[07:39:25] <Blondie101010> *mean
[07:39:40] <boobie> maybe i should just let us all use wireguard
[07:39:51] <boobie> and not put it on wan
[07:39:53] <Blondie101010> that is so irrelevant

[07:40:07] <boobie> my friends wont mess with it
[07:40:24] <__adrian> then what are you worried about? give them all ftp credentials.
[07:40:29] <Blondie101010> but that's not a reason to do it badly when it's easy to make it better
[07:40:33] <__adrian> ^
[07:40:42] <boobie> Blondie101010: i have 0 php knowledge
[07:40:53] <Blondie101010> well learn
[07:40:55] <boobie> so its not easy ofr me to make it better and web seemed the most convienent as opposed to them using ftp
[07:41:29] <__adrian> you have two options: learn, which is what we're trying to help you do, or solve your problem in another way (such as using an existing solution, or hiring someone).
[07:41:51] <boobie> so no way of you telling me how to make that line work?
[07:42:11] <Blondie101010> searching for an existing solution is a good first step in looking for one
[07:42:15] <__adrian> that line is wrong. i _am_ giving you advice on how to write code that _will_ work.
[07:42:26] <__adrian> if you don't want it... i can't make you do it.
[07:42:45] <boobie> so that line i've commented out cant even work in the script?
[07:43:00] <__adrian> *use finfo functions. *throw an exception if the file is not allowed.
[07:43:13] <boobie> ok thank you im going to read up on finfo
[07:43:16] <boobie> see if i can get it in there
[07:43:43] <__adrian> that line will do something, but not something useful. it might do the right thing by accident in some cases, but won't in others.
[07:44:16] <__adrian> it's not that you have a typo or something like that. it's that the code does not solve the problem.
[07:45:30] <__adrian> is that the actual form / input names you're using?
[07:49:30] <__adrian> if (! in_array((new Finfo(FILEINFO_MIME_TYPE))->file($file), $array_of_allowed_mime_types)) { throw new Exception("disallowed format"); }
[07:50:26] <__adrian> might have typos.
[07:51:21] <__adrian> boobie: re: form names: if those _are_ the actual input names, then you need to fix your error reporting settings. that will probably give you a helpful clue.
[07:51:25] <__adrian> !+error reporting
[07:51:25] <php-bot> Set `error_reporting = -1` in your php.ini (to see errors on your webpage, also set `display_errors = 1`) and be sure to restart your webserver/fastcgi-listeners. Using `ini_set()` and `error_reporting()` is less reliable - for example, in the case of parse errors. See https://php.net/errorfunc.configuration or "/msg php-bot error logging" for more.

[21:19:41] <dag> lets say im fetching 100k records from db. is there any difference performance wise with array, stdclass and a plain user defined class?
[21:20:45] <stenno\OK> i would say that that rather depends on the interface you are using, the kind of the query and the kind of the database instead of return types
[21:21:59] <dag> my case is a simple SELECT with sqlite
[21:25:29] <judah> I think I remember from the php7 days that arrays had less overhead and were slightly faster, though there was the caveat that they only worked in sizes of a power of two.
[21:26:19] <judah> So an array with 6 items allocates 8 places, an item with 33 allocates 64, something like that
[21:26:33] <judah> Though I may be misremembering
[21:26:50] <__adrian> arrays vs. objects is not going to be your problem. it's simply the size of the list.
[21:27:04] <__adrian> look at generators
[21:27:24] <__adrian> if you don't _have to_ work with the whole list at once, then don't.
