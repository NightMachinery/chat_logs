[02:22:08] <tomreyn> tommy` / cbreak: vsftpd is an FTP server, which also supports FTP+TLS=FTPS. It does not support SFTP, a file transport protocol based on SSH, which in use (available commands), not in implementation (different code), bears some similarities to the FTP protocol. SFTP (think OpenSSH) provides much better security than FTPS (think vsftpd) does, should be preferred. I think FileZilla supports both protocols.

[03:58:29] <axsuul> yea that sounds maybe it's the issue, the "server" is on a residential ISP, while the "client" is in a datacenter

[12:02:37] *** Quits: sanz (~sanz@112.4.46.71) (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:03:31] <ThinkT510> it is a meta-package so it can't assume what you already have installed. someone could have installed it without already having a desktop environment
[12:03:57] <no_gravity> ThinkT510: Ok, but why is there no package that comes without applications?

[13:33:37] <sanz> I've been using ubuntu for 14 years
[13:34:00] <sanz> just upgraded to 20.04 months ago
[13:34:09] <lotuspsychje> sanz: dependency issues is when users start to install manual debs or ppa's and then conflict with packages from the repos
[13:34:28] <lotuspsychje> sanz: maybe you should doublecheck your sources.list ?
[13:35:30] <KBar> sanz apt has always been the default. synaptic is just a graphical (gtk+) front end to apt
[13:35:51] <sanz> hmm... right to the point.
[13:36:13] <KBar> and apt itself is a high-level cli to the more low-leevl dpkg
[13:36:27] <KBar> they should not cause problems to each other
[13:36:38] <KBar> you can use both

[13:38:52] <KBar> sanz perhaps your system didnt upgrade successfully/fully
[13:39:27] <KBar> now you have broken dependencies, i.e. some packages are stuck in the old version
[13:39:30] <sanz> KBar: Sorry I did not put it right. I just got a new hardware and had a new installation
[13:40:12] <sanz> I was using 18.04 before, so I said "upgrade"
[13:40:34] <KBar> so is that a fresh install or upgrade?

[14:50:50] <hid3> Hello everyone. I am doing "do-release-upgrade" in non-interactive mode. How do I prevent/exclude a single service from being autorestarted during the upgrade process?
[14:53:08] <weedmic> do you mean mark a package as "taboo"? hid3
[14:55:23] <hid3> no... I mean, when the upgrade is going, it automatically restarts some services (for example, upon libc6 upgrade, if memory serves me right). Among that service is 'supervisorctl', which in turn launches other applications, some of which consume CPU and perform disk intensive activities, which slows down the upgrade process by a lot
[14:55:42] <hid3> so in this case, I want to somehow prevent 'supervisor' be restarted during upgrade

[23:22:39] <bob518> cbreak that didn't help. It showed a cursor at the top left corner but nothing. Then I did hard reboot.

[23:30:59] <cbreak> bob518: so switching to an other TTY didn't give you a login prompt?
[23:31:43] *** Joins: pah (~pah@user/pah)
[23:31:45] <bob518> cbreak as you told I did ctrl alt f1.... but it didn't work if that's what you mean
[23:32:04] <cbreak> no, F1 is to go back

[23:32:19] <cbreak> you should switch to some other TTY (like 4 or what ever), then switch back to F1
[23:32:23] <bob518> I did f1, f2 and all of them. Didn't work
[23:32:28] <cbreak> hmm :/

[23:51:37] <TJ-> bob518: that could be the issue - I know at times in the past it wouldn't show TTYs and there'd just be the flashing cursor you describe. I've not messed with the Nvidia drivers in years, they're just too much trouble :)
[23:52:33] <bob518> TJ- so there's no solution? It was working fine just couple of days ago.
[23:53:03] <TJ-> bob518: well there should be of course, but finding it...! there's the problem
