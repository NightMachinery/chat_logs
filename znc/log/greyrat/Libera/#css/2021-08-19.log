[16:31:45] <phryk> I did some flexboxing with flex-direction: column for adaptive footer placement and that works and all, but now my headers width has shrunken down. why does a flex *column* even do anything with element widths? o_O
[16:32:21] <phryk> curiously, it *didn't* have the same effect on the <main>…
[16:35:31] <phryk> i basically just have a <header>, <main> and <footer> in my <body> and the <body> is the element with `display: flex; flex-direction: column;` – header and main have `max-width: 80ex;` and I'm really confused why they're handed differently – far as my understanding goes both are just block elements with semantic names and should be handled equally…

[23:13:42] <matsaman> bootstrap is famous for being irregular, on top of being shite
[23:14:21] <foo> matsaman: thanks, good to know. I thought it was a good alternative but maybe that's old news... is there something you prefer instead?
[23:14:54] <DPA> DIY
[23:15:07] <DPA> There is nothing better
[23:15:50] <foo> DPA: I was doing CSS in the 90s. There are probably ways to DIY that I don't know about that are easier than bootstrap. ... actually, maybe bootstrap bridged the gap and was good pre-CSS3 or such. I can't keep up anymore.
[23:16:13] <foo> Is that a safe assumption? Bootstrap served it's purpose at some point in time, but with the improvements of CSS it's not really needed?

[23:16:43] <matsaman> all those frameworks are clusterfscks
[23:16:58] <matsaman> you are either obligated to use them as part of a team, or your life _doesn't_ suck
[23:17:03] <hassoon> foo: share your fiddle
[23:17:18] <foo> hassoon: I added the class manually and fixed it. :) Thank you.
[23:17:30] <hassoon> ya doing css is better than putting things together like a lego game with bootstrap
[23:17:34] <DPA> But then again, all websites are expected to look exactly like a bootstrap site nowadays, all do look like it and use it, so you may as well use it.
[23:18:27] <foo> hassoon: would you say that's more true now than it was in earlier versions of bootstrap? I could have sworn bootstrap served it's purpose at some moment iin time
[23:19:11] <hassoon> foo: get yourself familiar with writing css, that's what i'm trying to say
[23:19:19] <matsaman> fad shite that breaks backward compatibility all the time
[23:19:29] <foo> Ok, so maybe bootstrap never had it's place.
[23:19:29] <foo> Heh
[23:19:37] <hassoon> foo: yoll likely get help here if you ask a css question, not a bootstrap question
[23:19:44] <matsaman> if you like that type of framework there are less unreliable ones, but they're less popular than bootstrap, and remain shite
[23:19:47] <hassoon> you'll *
[23:20:16] <foo> hassoon: fair enough. ;)
[23:20:17] <hassoon> foo: otherwise you have nothing to do other than reading your framework's docs and figuring out what to do
[23:20:36] <hassoon> foo: we will help you fix your bootstrap issues using raw CSS in fact, fyiu
