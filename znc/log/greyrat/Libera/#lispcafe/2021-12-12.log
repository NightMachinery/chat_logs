[05:16:58] * mfiano is not a C programmer
[05:17:34] <mfiano> also what does 'restrict' on a parameter do, and is it something I have to reflect in a CFFI defcfun wrapper?
[05:19:19] <moon-child> those are type qualifiers
[05:19:49] <mfiano> Ok, I thought so, as that is what OpenGL calls them (a C-like language specification)
[05:19:50] <moon-child> restrict says that a pointer is not aliased.  You don't have to specify that in your wrapper (though you should still note it in documentation or such as a restriction)
[05:19:56] <mfiano> What about the second question?
[05:20:00] <mfiano> Oh.
[05:21:57] <mfiano> What does the _t suffix on a parameter type mean?
[05:22:23] <mfiano> I see that a lot. I'm guessing it's just to signify a custom type
[05:23:10] <moon-child> yeah, just a convention to indicate a type name.  Technically it's reserved for posix but people use it anyway
[05:23:19] <mfiano> So for something like "char * devname(dev_t dev, mode_t type);", is there a sane solution to find out what dev_t and mode_t actually are/where they are defined?
[05:23:55] <moon-child> ctags maybe
[05:24:13] <moon-child> or I think people are using 'clangd' or some such these days?  idk

[05:25:30] <moon-child> ctags I usually just 'ctags **/*.[ch]' and then 'vim -t whatever'
[05:25:43] <moon-child> I think you can ^5 over an identifier to jump to it too (in vim)
[05:25:58] <moon-child> can also just peek in the 'tags' file it generates

[07:21:24] <lagash> mfiano: I inherited some book on performance tuning AIX systems.. never cared to read it..
[07:21:25] <moon-child> ioctl is a demonstration that open() read() write() close() do _not_ a complete interface make
[07:21:51] <White_Flame> well, unless all your ioctl stuff is on a separate open/read/write/close command channel :-P
[07:22:07] <mfiano> lagash: This was many years ago. I haven't touched it since
[07:22:20] <moon-child> oh, yes, accept() is another one.  Because pipes are for bytes, so you can't send an fd over one
[07:22:54] <moon-child> White_Flame: that is yet _another_ problem: textual channels encourage in-band comms
[07:23:23] <White_Flame> except they're not really textual channels.  They're byte channels with no encoding specified
[07:23:45] <White_Flame> which compounds that even worse
[07:24:32] <moon-child> sure, yes.  I should say, channels which lack inherent structure

[11:31:59] <hayley> Pity we can't arrange to get a correlation graph.
[11:33:12] <aeth> sham1: it's more the culture of Wikipedia, where just about any notable article must be fought over on notability grounds (which is funny because it's this middle area where all of the fights happen because everything else just flies under the radar entirely)

[11:53:09] <aeth> if it's from the 1920s, I wonder if it's online, and if not maybe it should be scanned
[11:53:15] <moon-child> it is rather poorly typeset, like some newspapers; hyphenation is nil or poor, and columns are narrow, so text has a tendency to get  s  p  a  c  e  d     f  a  r     o  u  t
[11:53:19] <aeth> too bad the public domain stopped in the 1920s...
[11:54:02] <moon-child> aeth: good point.  They have a rather large book collection (probably 10-20 full cases) and I expect many of those books are preserved nowhere
[11:55:30] <aeth> I definitely understand that point about hyphenation. It's not really obvious at all unless you have text in just the right situation.

[12:46:09] <hayley> Good morning beach!
[12:46:33] <gilberth> Ok. This Rust adventure is interesting. I did toy implementations of a Lisp interpreter in C, PostScript, Perl, MBASIC with CP/M-80, Go, Pascal (sic!). And Rust is the first language which makes me consider to ditch the language and implement a virtual machine and hack the Lisp in that virtual machine.
[12:47:26] <hayley> lol
[12:47:38] <gilberth> hayley: Yes, I am early. I do my very best to be able to apply for German citizenship.
[12:48:02] <hayley> Don't worry, there are slow bytecode VMs in Rust as well as slow direct interpreters.
[12:48:33] <gilberth> hayley: Indeed, milady. And in this way it is interesting as it shows how painful and low-power that language is. I would actually prefer to use 80'ies BASIC.
[12:48:48] <hayley> https://github.com/Wafelack/orion e.g.
[12:48:48] -ixelp- GitHub - Wafelack/orion: Orion is a high level, purely functional programming language with a LISP based syntax.
[12:49:10] <hayley> My own Netfarm VM is "only" 3x as slow as CPython, while bounds checking everything that could be bounds checked.
[12:49:37] <hayley> Oh, watch out, that's GPLv3 licensed, pretty sure you don't want to remember anything in that VM.
[12:50:03] *** Joins: makomo (~makomo@user/makomo)
[12:51:09] <gilberth> And I must confess that my Go experience was the least painful and the performance of the Lisp I implemented was pretty good. Postscript was the most fun as I could compile Lisp to PS at run time. And the Ghostscript interpreter matched CLISP in speed.
[12:51:57] <hayley> OTOH I now have global value numbering in SICL working.
[12:52:26] <gilberth> That is great news. Port to CCL, when?
[12:52:41] <hayley> Probably never, as I don't know the Clozure compiler.
[12:52:45] <moon-child> I thought you had given up on macos?  Do you still use ccl?
[12:53:06] <hayley> But SICL will now only generate one assignment for (let ((x 1)) (setq x 2) (setq x 3) x), whereas SBCL generates three.
[12:53:30] <gilberth> Anyhow, it's a pity that I don't like to write. I guess this hobby of mine to implement a toy Lisp in many obscure languages could be a fun read. And it tells sth about the target languages.
[12:53:59] <gilberth> moon-child: Even on Linux I use CCL. I just don't like batch compilers.
[12:54:06] <hayley> inb4 "Should have just used Vec<LispData>!!! Linked lists are slow!!!!" and/or "Just use indices into heap array!!!!!"
[12:54:46] <hayley> Minor revelation: basic blocks are to a sea of nodes as CDR coding is to a linked list: the former saves some pointers, but makes code motion a pain.
[12:55:47] <gilberth> Yep, just go old school and have you pointers as indices. Knuth get away with it in TeX for the same reasons as Pascal implementations were poor and thus he used Pascal as sth like a portable assembler. And crafted an ad-hoc macro processor for some sanity.
[12:56:11] <gilberth> I was just about to do the same with Rust.
[12:56:34] <moon-child> I did the same when I wrote a lisp interpreter in j
[12:56:40] <moon-child> that let me do a compacting gc in 7 lines of code

[12:57:28] <moon-child> every object is an n-dimensional array of numbers or characters
[12:57:30] <moon-child> yeah like apl
[12:59:14] <gilberth> moon-child: BTW, CirCL (I am not sure about the spelling at all) was some briefly lived CL in CL implementation. beach ditched that, but it was more along my still current philosophy: Implemented as much as possible in CL itself with an existing CL as your target and see.

[13:02:15] <gilberth> Could you compile to chains of closures? Or did you go the byte-code route?
[13:03:14] <moon-child> neither; I did it metacircularly
[13:03:31] <gilberth> Ah ok. Was it fun?
[13:03:32] <moon-child> more interested in the data representation.  J does not have closures nor pointers nor mutation
[13:03:33] <moon-child> yes

[13:06:25] <moon-child> i would definitely put it on my resume if i had gotten a knuth cheque
[13:06:33] <moon-child> but gcs are not in vogue these days.  Apparently
[13:08:14] <hayley> I don't think r/programminglanguages is representative of the industry, FWIW
[13:09:12] <gilberth> Speaking of which, look at my macro defining macro at <http://clim.rocks/gilbert/rust-take-3.rs.txt>
[13:09:40] <gilberth> I believe sth is broken with the language when you resort to such a macro that early in the game.
[13:09:58] <moon-child> gilberth: pls no h-word
[13:10:22] <gilberth> h? Which h?
[13:10:23] <hayley> h-word?
[13:10:50] <gilberth> And look how far I got. I got nowhere.
[13:11:01] <hayley> Well, that change to copying is inconsequential.
[13:11:46] <moon-child> gilberth: 'hygiene'
[13:12:13] <gilberth> I have not used that word. You have.
[13:12:30] <moon-child> you do not need to name them to use them

[18:34:23] <ck_> ... that had and survived it. sorry, wrong button.  and sure, you're right about the variant
[18:34:38] <ck_> I guess nobody really knows because of a lot of unreported cases
[18:37:49] <gilberth> Any news on how effective vaccination is to protect from Omicron? And why do I see it spelled "Omnicron" so often?
[18:39:20] <ck_> omnicron :)
[18:39:23] <ck_> MULTIPASS
[18:39:46] <shka> no definitive data yet
[18:40:33] <gilberth> Well, it'll be omnipresent.
[18:41:08] <shka> it came from africa, with low levels of vaccination
[18:41:15] <selwyn> this country doesn't have the social solidarity or effective government to really try and marshal itself
[18:41:24] <shka> and widespread HIV presence
[18:41:44] <gilberth> Yep, what we know is that we know nothing.
[18:42:11] <ck_> if a new strain "comes from" a region with low vaccination rates, isn't it more likely that the vaccination is still effective? 
[18:42:39] <selwyn> it could have evolved in someone who was highly immunocompromised
[18:42:54] <selwyn> iiuc this means it can pick up lots of exotic traits
[18:42:56] <shka> ck_: yes, that's why there is no reason to expect that vaccines are less effective
[18:43:16] <ck_> selwyn: oh? how come?
[18:43:30] <shka> also, HIV, with the reverse transcription is the perfect mutation breeding grounds
[18:43:34] <selwyn> in s africa 20% of the population is hiv positive
[18:44:18] <gilberth> You believe Omicron picked up traits from HIV?
[18:44:28] <selwyn> no
[18:44:29] <ck_> I mean the picking up of traits, I don't understand the connection
[18:44:48] <shka> gilberth: it is actually very unlikely because HIV and covid attack different cells
[18:45:05] <shka> but unlikely != impossible 
[18:45:05] <selwyn> again, i am no biologist, but my understanding is that the virus can mutate a lot in someone who doesn't have as good an immune system
[18:45:14] <selwyn> perhaps the virus load can simply grow much more idk
[18:45:21] <selwyn> i rather thought this was shka's point about hiv presence
[18:45:30] <shka> selwyn: that as well
[18:45:51] <shka> but viral genetic transfer is a thing 
[18:46:09] <gilberth> Ok, but of what significance is it then that we first noticed it in a high HIV positive rate population? /me is puzzled.
[18:46:24] <shka> and it is possible that covid would get some rhinovirus genes 
[18:46:38] <selwyn> viruses share genes?
[18:46:41] * ck_ .oO( this is a cookbook )
[18:46:56] <shka> gilberth: vaccines don't work well in AIDS patients
[18:47:23] <shka> so that's point to consider about overall vaccine effectiveness
[18:47:25] <shka> selwyn: yeah
[18:47:29] <selwyn> well
[18:47:31] <selwyn> fuck
[18:47:43] <shka> selwyn: i mean, it is unlikely in this case
[18:47:57] <selwyn> ok
[18:48:10] <gilberth> .oO(????)
[18:48:23] <shka> but this is how flue virus strains are generated actually
[18:49:10] <shka> also, it could be possible that human covid would pick genetic material from other bat population in South America at some point
[18:49:34] <shka> in summary, there is no putting this genie back in the bottle 
[18:50:07] <gilberth> Do viruses actually pick up genes from other viruses? They breed so to speak?
[18:50:45] <shka> gilberth: yeah, during co-infection usually
[18:51:07] <gilberth> Oops. That's bad, isn't it?
[18:51:29] <shka> well, it is not a news 
[18:51:40] <shka> and the good old flu is actually the best example of that
[18:51:43] <shka> namely 
[18:52:15] <shka> there is avian flu, human flu, and pigs happen to be infected by both kinds
[18:52:36] <shka> so if you ever was wondering how avian flu jumps to human, this is how
[18:52:46] <gilberth> ok
[18:53:22] <selwyn> bird flu is really bad here
[18:54:06] <shka> gilberth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_virus
[18:54:21] <selwyn> shka: do you think they will get rid of polio soon?
[18:54:45] <shka> uh, polio is almost gone?
[18:54:52] <selwyn> yes
[18:55:20] <shka> well, i guess it is possible, though it is hard to tell when this happens
[18:55:42] <shka> USA keeps the reserve of smallpox vaccine just in case
[18:55:46] <shka> for instance
[18:56:09] <selwyn> well they keep a reserve of smallpox as well :o
[18:56:28] <shka> and smallpox was officially eliminated in the 1980
[18:56:37] <shka> selwyn: officially no
[18:57:11] <shka> the smallpox in the USA/USSR possession was officially killed in the 1980
[18:59:03] <shka> selwyn: oh, wiki says otherwise, my bad
[18:59:39] <shka> the fuck, world?
[18:59:43] <shka> get your shit together
[19:00:27] <shka> you have already doomsday machine in the form of missile submarine, no need for smallpox
[19:02:25] <shka> Ohio class sub can carry 24 tridents, and each trident can carry up to 14 warheads
