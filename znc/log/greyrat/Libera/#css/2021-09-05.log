[11:25:21] <Rockwood> anything wrong to use this kind of tag?
[11:32:47] <AMcBain> Rockwood, Aside from browsers not supporting it anymore and it being generally a nuisance / anti-accessible?
[11:33:42] <Rockwood> AMcBain, https://jsfiddle.net/hcLbs2mn/7/ but its works here
[11:34:33] <AMcBain> Only because you added lines 37-65 in your CSS.
[11:35:30] <AMcBain> Let me rephrase: it is a recognized tag, but you should not attempt to replicate the behavior of it in any fashion.

[11:39:09] <theskillwithin> tldr not good idea to use Rockwood
[11:41:38] <Rockwood> ok
[11:41:51] <Rockwood> but i need blinking there
[11:42:47] <Rockwood> theskillwithin, AMcBain ^^
[11:42:56] <Rockwood> i means animation
[11:43:23] <AMcBain> There is absolute no reason to ever "need" blinking.
[11:43:34] <theskillwithin> use animation keyframes,  don't use blink tag
[11:43:40] <Rockwood> okay
[11:43:43] <Rockwood> thanks
[11:43:46] <AMcBain> They already are, but see above: nobody should be replicating the blink tag.
[11:43:50] <AMcBain> Even with CSS animations.
[11:44:02] <AMcBain> There's more than one reason it nerfed.
[11:44:47] <theskillwithin> im not answering should right now,  just how
[11:45:16] <Rockwood> theskillwithin, how to use it in makestyle in react?
[11:45:17] <AMcBain> There's no reason we can't guide people to better solutions.
[11:45:31] <AMcBain> Rockwood, what is the reason you want to have a blink there? (not need, want)
[11:45:38] <theskillwithin> AMcBain i agree
[11:45:57] <Rockwood> i wanna attract player to show in the list
[11:46:14] <AMcBain> Yeah there are so many better ways to make something more visibly striking.
[11:46:23] <AMcBain> That don't break accessibility guidelines.
[11:46:54] <Rockwood> <AMcBain> Yeah there are so many better ways to make something more visibly striking. like which are those?
[11:47:20] <AMcBain> If the rest of the UI doesn't have a lot of color, you can give it one, or give it a striking color that's not used anywhere else. You can give it a glow, you can... anything!
[11:47:23] <theskillwithin> Rockwood are you still trying to make video game?
[11:47:26] <AMcBain> Anything but blinking.
[11:47:56] <Rockwood> theskillwithin, not video game
[11:48:15] <Rockwood> just simply a web application
[11:48:30] <AMcBain> Then you definitely don't need it to blink.
[11:48:39] <AMcBain> Annoying websites will cause people to leave.
[11:49:20] <Rockwood> yes grow is better option i think
[11:49:27] <Rockwood> glow*
[11:50:15] <AMcBain> Principles of good websites (imo) well laid out content (don't put things in strange places), no carousels, and minimize animations.
[11:51:03] <Rockwood> suppose if its social networking site then?
[11:51:07] <theskillwithin> i can confirm that carousels lead to lower profits
[11:51:35] <AMcBain> Rockwood, then you shouldn't be building it at all.
[11:51:49] <Rockwood> theskillwithin, they again banned me there :(
[11:51:57] <Rockwood> for 5 days
[11:52:12] <theskillwithin> cuz im op doesn't mean i will unban u
[11:52:25] <theskillwithin> thats between you and the op
[11:52:34] <Rockwood> yeah i can understand
[11:53:00] <Rockwood> anyway
[11:53:12] <Rockwood> i need to find another good way
[11:53:30] <Rockwood> focus could be helpful in my case?
[11:54:01] <Rockwood> one more question
[11:54:16] <Rockwood> hover also not good idea to use on website?
[11:54:29] <AMcBain> It depends. It shouldn't be the only way to do something.
[11:54:51] <Rockwood> what could be replace hover?
[11:56:45] <Rockwood> JS only the way to do similar like hover by state
[11:57:16] <AMcBain> Depends on what you're using it for. If you're just using it for a "the cursor is on top of it" interaction, then you should also have some styles for focus (keyboard accessibility) and there's a style for active (pressed down), etc.
[11:57:47] <AMcBain> If you're using it to show content, then don't. You can have the content show on trigger by tap/click or the like, but better yet probably should just be visible if possible.

[14:51:13] <theskillwithin> i heavily dislike ui libraries
[14:51:57] <teut> me too, they block my ability to use css
[14:52:09] <Rockwood_> theskillwithin, i am surprise his code looks odd to me
[14:52:27] <teut> I use react and I totally forget that how things were done the css way
[14:52:40] <Rockwood_> many and multiple classes
[14:52:41] <teut> display:none,      opacity: 0->1 animation etc
[14:52:59] <Rockwood_> you know the selectors first
[14:53:08] <Rockwood_> then styling
[14:53:09] <teut> and react has the useTransition  hook still under experimentation
[14:53:21] <teut> so css or some framework can only help
[14:54:01] <teut> but doing those if else and rerenders make me totally forget that plain old tricks can still be used
[14:58:29] <theskillwithin> using a ui library, cuz u don't know how to make on ur own, will bite you in the ass

[15:29:26] <dka> the snippet I just dropped you will add 128px to the padding top and it will fix the web view, but I am not satisfied with that fix
[15:29:32] <dka> I believe there's something wrong with the flexbox
[15:29:35] <hassoon> dka: you mean for the responsive mode ?
[15:29:46] <dka> No I don't mean for the responsive mode, it's out of concern

[15:30:09] <dka> I think the screenshot speak by itself ? I can make a photoshop wio
[15:30:12] <theskillwithin> if you want react native to work like react, ur gunna have a bad time
[15:30:18] <dka> with the two next to each over, and we play the 7 differences games :)
[15:30:33] <dka> theskillwithin, I have 8 years of react dev and 3 of react native
[15:30:42] <dka> check our project I already do
[15:30:45] <dka> https://github.com/pass-culture/pass-culture-app-native
[15:30:47] <dka> I already do have web
[15:31:06] <dka> now that you also have the POC thanks to the URL I just dropped, could we just focus on the CSS part ? and not the technical part of react ?
[15:31:10] <dka> That would help find the root cause
[15:32:39] <dka> And react-native does not work like react at all, react native use react under the hood, I think you are mistaking the comparaison react-native and react-dom
[15:32:53] <dka> as JSX from react work for both react-native and react and everyone expect to be like it
[15:33:27] <dka> react-dom will render the jsx in a DOM environment, while react-native while render the JSX in iOS and Android environment using a JS sandbox that have API to native component
[15:33:55] <dka> react-native-web is actually web, it use DOM element and can render in the DOM using react-dom, so basically , it is web, (as in the POC from the URL)

[16:04:20] <dka> It appear that if I had a style flex: 1 it work, but from the styled-components/native api, I can't mix the two, I can only fix using the DOM developers tools

[16:06:44] <theskillwithin> its not that hard
[16:11:39] <theskillwithin> dka https://flexboxfroggy.com/
[16:12:18] <dka> well, I know the basics and use it for a while, but in this case I don't get why flex is behaving like that
[16:12:52] <dka> it seems you can't combine flex-grow:1 and flex:1 , if flex-grow is applied on top of flex, it remain broken, but if I apply flex on top of flex-grow, it is then fixed, but I have to keep the flex-grow
[16:13:16] <dka> I believe this may not work in all browser, and also I can't use the css in js API to apply both styles, so I am kind of stuck with this ugly marginBottom fix
[16:13:39] <dka> and it's web fix specific, kind of annoying when developing proper flexbox for 3 platforms
[16:13:46] <theskillwithin> flex: 1 literally means flex grow
[16:14:05] <dka> it literraly does something different

[18:16:39] <teut> How to override !important
[18:16:40] <teut> A) Add another CSS rule with !important, and either give the selector a higher specificity (adding a tag, id or class to the selector), or add a CSS rule with the same selector at a later point than the existing one. This works because in a specificity tie, the last rule defined wins.
