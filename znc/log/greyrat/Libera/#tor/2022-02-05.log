[01:27:21] <diverdude> Hello, i have ExitNodes {us},{ca},{za},{sg},{gb} and StrictNodes 1 ExcludeExitNodes "{lu},{se},{nl}" in my /etc/tor/torrc. however i still seem to get ip addresses from countries outside the ones i have specified. For example i get ip addresses from luxembourg even though that i even put luxembourg in ExcludeExitNodes. What am I doing wrong? Is there any way i can only get exitnodes in US?
[01:29:15] <xx> diverdude: how are you checking where the IP addresses physically are?
[01:32:25] <diverdude> i am using a small python script where i use requests to get ip address and then i onvert that to a country using ipinfo library: https://dpaste.org/UWaR
[01:32:58] <xx> it probably incorrectly resolves the IP address to country then
[01:33:17] <xx> the exit node operators are supposed to truthfully declare where the node physically is (country-level)
[01:33:54] <xx> it = your way of checking
[01:34:21] <diverdude> hmm ok i see
[01:34:59] <diverdude> but i have also tried other online services to map ip-address to a country....and they also show unexpected countries
[01:35:28] <diverdude> xx: it cannot be that the exitnode feature has been obsoleted or something right?
[01:36:40] <xx> do all the online services at least agree with each other?
[01:36:51] <diverdude> yes
[01:36:58] <xx> the exitnode feature is not really supposed to be used by endusers
[01:37:01] <diverdude> at least the ones i have tried
[01:37:46] <diverdude> ok, what is it supposed to be used to then?
[01:38:25] <xx> it's just there because it was useful for testing
[01:38:31] <xx> still is
[01:38:52] <xx> typically as part of testing specific exit nodes for "proper" behavior
[01:40:21] <diverdude> hmm ok i see. SO it has unreliable behaviour?
[01:40:52] <xx> the function is reliable, but it's used as a test if you want to see if a specific exit node is doing some weird filtering for example
[01:41:00] <xx> without having to compile a new tor binary
[01:41:08] <xx> it's part of a test suite
[01:41:56] <diverdude> hmm actually now i got ip: 104.244.72.65  it shows luxembourg in my python script, but it shows turkey on https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/104.244.72.65
[01:43:14] <diverdude> here it also shows lux: https://www.ip2location.com/demo/104.244.72.65
[01:43:18] <xx> yeah all those services are using different IP-to-country databases
[01:44:26] <diverdude> and this one shows US https://dnschecker.org/ip-whois-lookup.php?query=104.244.72.65
[01:44:34] <diverdude> ok...i see your point
[01:44:54] <diverdude> so it actually could be that its working ok
[01:45:04] <diverdude> its just my ip lookup that stinks
[01:50:05] <xx> yup
[01:50:38] <diverdude> is there any reliable lookup service?
[01:50:44] <xx> there's the paid geoip database
[01:50:55] <xx> from maxmind
[01:52:02] <diverdude> hmm interesting. maxmind shows country: Anonymous Proxy
[01:53:25] <diverdude> i wonder how they can know that
[02:04:38] <xx> because the list of exit nodes is public
[02:04:54] <xx> so they just periodically download it and check IPs against it
[02:09:19] *** Joins: monkey_ (~user@190.104.116.153)
[02:09:30] <diverdude> i see. thats interesting
[02:11:30] <xx> well, they have to be public
[02:15:51] <diverdude> why is that
[02:16:29] <xx> because the tor client has to know how to build the path
[02:16:40] <xx> and it can't do that if it doesn't have a list of all the nodes

[22:09:22] <jkk> xx they dont block tor for all like in china
[22:09:25] <jkk> in turkey
[22:09:30] <jkk> even in china people use vpn
[22:09:46] <jkk> and yes dont mind jess she is obssessed about me Xd
[22:10:18] <xx> the stats show frequent dips in traffic from turkey
[22:10:28] <xx> so turkey definitely does block tor entirely at times
[22:10:55] <jkk> how I am connected then hmmm
[22:10:58] <jkk> am I
[22:11:21] <jkk> maybe as you said at times
[22:11:42] <xx> they don't update the blocklists in realtime
[22:11:51] <jkk> nice :)
[22:12:07] <xx> plus at times the various gov agencies need tor access too
[22:12:25] <xx> and doing an unblock for a specific range would reveal the IPs of gov operatives
[22:12:31] <xx> so they just unblock it country-wide
[22:12:46] <jkk> :))))))))))
[22:13:07] <Atque> jkk: Doesn't she say you're a fat man?
[22:13:29] <Atque> jkk: I never understood why fat men spam so much.
[22:13:40] <jkk> jess is fat yes
[22:13:51] <jkk> that is why she stalks some guys online 
[22:14:09] <jkk> I have to change my nick LOL
[22:14:38] <xx> well, when a fat man explodes, it takes the whole city with it
[22:14:51] <xx> so fear of fat man is warranted
[22:14:58] <Atque> xx: In all Five Eye countries, the Information Security Manual requires blocking all egress and ingress to Tor. Whether that is really possible is another matter of course.
[22:15:22] <Atque> xx: (In terms of networks in government agencies and military installations).
[22:16:04] <Atque> jkk: Do you enjoy golf?
[22:16:05] <xx> that probably doesn't cover this particular case, because I can say with 100% confidence that tor is actively being used in US military
[22:16:22] <jkk> xx: well dont worry she is around 89 kg 5`1
[22:16:24] <jkk> :)
[22:16:26] <xx> well, US armed forces to be more specific
