[00:07:38] <ljharb> stagas: you need to auth
[00:08:10] <stagas> hola. is there a better way than rebinding a method within a proxy get ? e.g foo has method bar, foo.bar() but if foo is behind a proxy, proxy.bar() doesn't work because "this" becomes the proxy and it throws invalid invocation for dom methods, so in the get handler currently i'm doing return method.bind(target)
[00:08:16] <stagas> ljharb: thx
[00:08:31] <ljharb> Sqaure: re Haskell, popularity doesn’t confer quality, but unpopularity proves a lack of quality.
[00:08:50] <ljharb> stagas: proxy shouldn’t be used except for what it’s designed for: in concert with membranes
[00:09:02] <ljharb> stagas: handlers take a target argument
[00:10:05] <stagas> ljharb: it's target, prop, receiver and i'm doing target[prop].bind(target) when it's a function

[00:10:10] <ljharb> you definitely don’t need to and shouldn’t use .bind here
[00:10:21] <ljharb> stagas: you need to return another proxy there.
[00:10:32] <ljharb> stagas: a proxy for the original function, in particular.
[00:10:44] <ljharb> stagas: but why are you using proxy at all?
[00:11:35] *** Joins: Naan (~Naan@user/naan)
[00:11:49] <stagas> ljharb: just adding syntactic sugar to some observables, because i don't want to do thing.get() i want the .get() to happen whenever i try to access a property, so thing.foo instead of thing.get().foo
[00:12:37] <ljharb> that’s not syntax sugar, fwiw, that’s api sugar. But also that’s kind of weird, why use the slowest most confusing approach possible, instead of just calling a function and passing the observable as an argument?

[00:23:27] <stagas> my question is: can i bind a proxy target to its own "this" rather than the proxy's without having to create new functions on every call? though they should be very cheap to compute and i'm overthinking it, foo.bar() and foo.bar.bind(foo)() should be JITted to the same exact execution since the bound method is never stored

[03:50:23] <buu> tokerboker: vue
[03:50:29] <tokerboker> :(
[03:50:38] <buu> react is like programming with half your fingers chopped off
[03:50:47] <tokerboker> bloody. literally.
[03:50:52] <tokerboker> and angular?
[03:50:54] <buu> worse
[03:50:56] <buu> =]
[03:51:02] <velix> buu: why vue?
[03:51:13] <tokerboker> cause it sounds similar to bae?
[03:51:22] <tokerboker> sounds/looks/close-enough
[03:51:24] <buu> velix: It took all the good ideas from react and made them actually easy and natural to use
[03:51:40] <velix> svelte also says this and said: I'm even better.
[03:51:40] <tokerboker> what about good ideas from angular?
[03:51:52] <buu> Dunno, does it have any?

[03:52:39] <buu> I'm not saying popularity is the ultimate way of measuring goodness but I think angular's relative lack of popularity is pretty solid evidence of developers not enjoying it
[03:53:13] <tokerboker> you just said popularity is a solid way of measuring it
[03:53:19] <velix> normally, the first answer of the guys in here is "do it in react".
[03:53:30] <tokerboker> i feel like i wanna go angular route
[03:53:36] <buu> vue is a little like rails, in that they waited long enough for people to evolve a bunch of good ideas for how to do this stuff then built a framework so the good ideas are the first class citizens
[03:54:00] <tokerboker> sounds like no future good ideas going in vue
[03:54:07] <tokerboker> cause first class citizens are built.
[03:54:13] <tokerboker> alreay.
[03:54:16] <tokerboker> already*
[03:54:23] <tokerboker> ok angular it is. thank you everyone.
[03:54:35] <buu> I think we're unlikely to see a major shift in this type of web developement in the near future
[03:54:52] <buu> People complain about web-js churn but react/vue have been around for quite a while at this point
[03:55:38] <tokerboker> https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/angular-vs-vue-vs-react/
[03:55:47] <buu> So I mean, 5 years from now there may be an amazing new way to do things but A) I wouldn't bet lots of money on it B) if it exists it's unlikely to be based on either react or vue
[03:56:15] <tokerboker> B - exactly why angular.
[03:56:50] <buu> I'm pretty sure angular is dead
[03:57:01] <tokerboker> oh
[03:57:11] <tokerboker> but its used by microsoft and google, no?
[03:57:21] <buu> I don't think it's used by microsoft, no
[03:57:28] <buu> I mean, I'm sure there's at least one project somewhere
[03:57:37] <buu> But it's not being picked for new stuff
[03:57:39] <velix> microsoft = typescript
[03:57:41] <velix> google = angular
[03:57:47] <velix> twitter = bootstrap
[03:57:55] <tokerboker> https://www.quora.com/Which-JavaScript-framework-does-Microsoft-use
[03:57:59] <buu> ooh quora
[03:58:04] <tokerboker> "Angular, on the other hand, is used for example by Microsoft. That should not be that surprising as TypeScript itself has been developed by the creators of Windows. Microsoft uses Angular to power its Office’s and Xbox’s websites. Among other Angular companies, one can find Delta Airlines, Santander Bank, and Forbes."

[03:59:07] <tokerboker> yes.
[03:59:11] <tokerboker> it certainly does.
[03:59:20] <buu> But angular is like java
[03:59:28] <tokerboker> oh man.
[03:59:33] <buu> You tend to end up in very specific areas that use it
[03:59:37] <tokerboker> you had to take a snipe at the only two languages i know.

[03:59:50] <tokerboker> you just said java is used in only "very specific areas" ?
[04:00:08] <buu> I mean, I don't dislike java but every java project I've seen doesn't sound like fun to work on
[04:00:20] <tokerboker> what language do you prefer.
[04:00:20] <buu> I'm not sure which comes first here
[04:00:23] <velix> JAVA works in billions of phones. A stolen clone, but ....
[04:00:28] <tokerboker> stolen ?
[04:00:32] <buu> stolen lol
[04:00:33] <velix> tokerboker: Android.
[04:00:38] <tokerboker> wasn't it bought?
[04:00:51] <tokerboker> acquired for $50M
[04:00:54] <tokerboker> in 2005.

[04:03:00] <tokerboker> and buu angular and java are general purpose languages.

[04:04:58] <buu> I'm more about programming for the sake of what you'll accomplish rather than the purity of the language
[04:05:21] <buu> I like perl, javascript and go for their emphasis on getting actual work done
[04:05:44] <KevinX> if you're questioning whether you should learn Angular then the answer is an immediate no
[04:05:48] <buu> lol
[04:06:31] <KevinX> Not because it's bad or anything, but because if you didn't already know the answer, then you should learn React (assuming those are the only two choices, as you mentioned)
[04:07:20] <buu> I mean, searching dice.com's default search location, react is like 6500 jobs, angular is like 6100 jobs, and vue is like 148 jobs
[04:07:25] <buu> So if you just want money
[04:07:46] <KevinX> im surprised angular is that high actually
[04:07:53] <buu> Personally I find react really obnoxious to use after vue because it does the same thing as vue but just slightly more painfully
[04:07:57] <buu> KevinX: Yeah I was mildly shocked

[04:10:35] <buu> tokerboker: Seriously though, learn skills based on the outcome you want, otherwise just do whatever is fun
[04:11:13] <KevinX> Whichever library/framework you choose you'll be ok
[04:11:14] <buu> I feel like angular and java tend to end up together so if you have java experience and are looking for a high paying programming job
[04:11:29] <buu> adding some angular skills to the resume is probably totally reasonable

[04:15:39] <KevinX> One more interesting thing about react. WordPress is essentially becoming a React application now. So the ol' concept that you'll always find work in PHP via WordPress will soon apply to anyone that knows React

[10:10:24] <ljharb> arash: ok well, that's a huge mistake. never put JS code inside php anything
[10:10:33] <ljharb> arash: all your JS should be in a lintable, testable, cacheable .js file.
[10:10:36] <ljharb> !server data @ arash
[10:10:37] <jellobot> arash, There's 3 options to properly get data from the server to the client: 1) fetch request from JS. 2) HTML data-* attributes, read them in JS. 3) <script type="application/json"></script>, read and parse it from JS, however this option requires special escaping of </script> in the json body. Never generate/template JS on the fly. See also !fetch
[10:10:43] <ljharb> and if you have any data in php, ^ that is how you get it to your js

[12:03:12] <ccapndave> I have a custom React hook which is supposed to lazy load something into the global context by embedding a script tag, and then return the global function via a function.  However, somehow the thing being returned isn't quite right?  Can anyone see something wrong with this hook?

[20:44:25] <systemfault> fweht: But your code may be wrong.

[20:45:09] <fweht> ah!  but the `this` refers to the outside `this`
[20:45:12] <fweht> is that not ok?
[20:45:13] <systemfault> The "this" in frame is not what you believe it is
[20:45:25] <systemfault> If you use "function", it creates its own "this
