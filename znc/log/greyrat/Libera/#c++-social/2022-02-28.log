[13:54:53] <MaNI> as much as I've often disagreed with Carbonflux in the past, I miss a world in which it was assumed that people had complex nuanced views, instead of this polarised nonsense where theres two camps and you're either in one or the other
[13:55:26] <Carbonflux> ya, there is a lot less dialog now.
[13:55:44] <MaNI> like its perfectly possible to be against the ridiculous masks, and thefore bring up a probably misguided comment about masks in the wat, while not being a raving bonkers mad extreme rightist who wants to give putin blowjobs
[13:55:51] <Faux> Mmm. I agree normally, but I (having not read the current Carbonflux nonsense) do think it has to be discouraged for things like public health.
[13:56:19] <MaNI> I feel like I used to live in that world but that in the last few years the "its to flattent he curve idiot" crowd have succesfully completely destroyed that world
[13:58:19] <Carbonflux> actually Faux people like you are the problem, you hear a few key words and start calling people stupid and a risk to others, its a domination tactic that you seem to think no one notices.
[13:58:22] <Faux> That argument is pretty incomprehensible to me, which is why I don't engage and just assume malcontent.
[13:58:34] <Faux> Jinx.
[13:59:01] <Faux> Malconent isn't even the word.
[13:59:09] <Faux> Mis-adventure? Evil.
[14:00:27] <Faux> "domination" is pretty hilarious as a claim. I am not the one who calls people stupid; you are the one who accuses people of evil debate tactics. I am happy to debate with evil people, but not if they are not willing to follow the debate rules.
[14:01:01] <Faux> If people don't want to talk to me about an issue, that's okay.
[14:02:24] <Svitkona> NOT okay
[14:02:35] <Faux> YOUR FACE IS NOT OKAY.
[14:02:42] <Carbonflux> you have a strong authority bias is all.

[14:03:12] <Carbonflux> you are still young and don't understand.
[14:03:15] <Faux> You conflate scientific advice with direct authority, which I strongly disagree with.

[14:07:52] *** Parts: Faux (~faux@fau.xxx) (WeeChat 3.4)
[14:07:57] <Carbonflux> really in the end that is what you are, you see someone you think you can bully and insult and so you do and if they fight back you blame them.
[14:10:39] <Carbonflux> i am as well versed in the sciences as you are if not more so, but rather than considering my opinion you seek to dominate and self validate based on orthodoxies you yourself have not verified.
[14:15:48] <Carbonflux> did Faux just rage quit?
[14:15:55] <Carbonflux> ah well, i tried.
[14:16:40] <hinst> What was the argument abouT
[14:16:47] <hinst> ?
[14:17:21] <Carbonflux> they are mad at me for considering the irony of wearing masks during a war.
[14:18:01] <Carbonflux> but on a deeper level they link me with anti-vaxers because i like to ask questions.
[14:18:19] <Carbonflux> even tho i am fully vaccinated.
[14:19:03] <Carbonflux> i just find the symbolism of mask wearing interesting. But it comes off as threat for some people.
[14:19:07] <MaNI> well that went well
[14:19:11] <Carbonflux> heh ya
[14:19:24] <Carbonflux> i will never be able to win him over.
[14:20:32] <Carbonflux> people are so jumpy now days its hard to explore ideas.
[14:26:23] <MaNI> the bundling of "anti vaxxers" with "people who don't want covid vaccines" is itself problematic and damaging, and I see it a lot at the next level where not liking masks immediately makes you an anti vaxxer, its not great
[14:27:30] <MaNI> its not really possible to have a sensible conversation in a world where thats a normal behaviour and acively encouraged
[14:28:08] <T`aZ> indeed
[14:28:33] <T`aZ> this can only end badly
[14:29:45] <Carbonflux> ya
[14:30:19] <jotham> 23:47:21 Carbonfl+| they are mad at me for considering the irony of wearing masks during a war.
[14:30:23] <jotham> fuck you're a dishonest fuck
[14:30:30] <T`aZ> and it is just the tip of the beginning, the descend will be long, and painful
[14:30:32] <jotham> you said some dumb shit yesterday
[14:30:36] <jotham> and are moaning about it again
[14:30:49] <jotham> grow up Carbonflux 
[14:32:20] <Carbonflux> ya T`aZ i think we are just going to have to go thru it again. 
[14:33:14] <Carbonflux> its like the world is a school and it repeats the same lessons every couple of generations.
[14:33:42] <Carbonflux> but each time the forms are different so we don't recognize them at first.
[14:34:46] <T`aZ> not sure it's a problem of recogniziing shitty behaviour
[14:35:11] <T`aZ> more like natural human nature, to be lead without thinking by default, until a certain point
[14:35:43] <T`aZ> sadly , we wont be there for the going better part
[14:35:58] <Carbonflux> ya, i agree.
[14:36:58] <Carbonflux> i often wonder if only individuals can learn from it and culture never changes. 
[14:37:16] <Carbonflux> the illusion of progress.
[14:37:27] <T`aZ> it needs a higher ratio of not stupid/total
[14:38:04] <T`aZ> there is probably a correlation between education level/smartness, and type of governement inn place
[14:38:10] <Carbonflux> i don't know how you get that without direct experience, knowledge does not seem to be enough.
[14:38:14] <jotham> naah T`aZ 
[14:38:20] <jotham> the soviet union did some great things for education
[14:38:25] <Renderwww> https://external-preview.redd.it/duU10pAZpof0guqTxPMY6C5K4E-PQOhHKBAJx5W_650.jpg?auto=webp&s=1d587945867e379de527fb6a22a54c1863a0fee8
[14:38:28] <jotham> the west has some very weird educational goals
[14:38:42] <T`aZ> you are taking of the present maybe
[14:38:48] <T`aZ> everything is going to shit everywhere
[14:38:54] <jotham> china is super fash too but very STEM
[14:38:57] <jotham> maybe stem makes you fash
[14:39:03] <jotham> america was more fash when they did the space program
[14:39:04] <MaNI> I think the pendulum swings between people caring too much about politics and running of things etc. and wasting too much of their time on it instead of being productive in their own lives, and caring not enough about it, palming absolutely all responsibility/decisions off to "government experts" and whatever twitter expert they follow etc. and being in general mostly just obsessed with their own life instead
[14:39:24] <MaNI> pendulum is currently too far to the second side of things and will probably swing further still before it corrects in the other way
[14:39:40] <Carbonflux> thats a great point.
[14:39:47] <Renderwww> I've got an idea, why don't we let scientists and experts run the government!
[14:40:10] <T`aZ> this was already a thing in the past
[14:40:13] <Carbonflux> its like we get a sweet spot in the middle every few generations and think we are doing better.
[14:40:36] <T`aZ> like, thousands of years ago, in greece iirc
[14:40:43] <Carbonflux> ya
[14:41:01] <Carbonflux> or North America before colonialism. 
[14:41:08] <T`aZ> an engineer could start workiing on a problem for the state, during some years, until said problem was fixed or something, then go back to his regular activities
[14:43:00] <T`aZ> i suggest everyone to read plato
[14:43:09] <Carbonflux> it does have to be constantly maintained but no one has ever managed it, an obvious answer is strong AI of course, but people would rebel against it.
[14:43:32] <T`aZ> mind blowing, concidering a lot of the issue are still present and applicable today
[14:43:36] <T`aZ> considering*
[14:44:03] <Carbonflux> i agree, it leaps across time, makes me realized how little people have changed.
[14:44:04] <Renderwww> wasn't plato the one with the uber dictatorial state?
[14:44:19] <T`aZ> yes, he explored that concept
[14:45:33] <Carbonflux> iirc he was also the one that created the metaphor of the table, where people feed each other or fight for food.
[14:46:25] <Carbonflux> so we are chained to each other, but if we cooperate we have abundance.
[14:51:36] <Carbonflux> i have to admit i have mostly given up on the idea of mass social progress.
[14:52:16] <Renderwww> eh? there was a lot of progress the past couple of hundred years
[14:53:29] <dukwon> only 5000 summer student applications this year, down from 7000 last year
[14:53:45] <dukwon> half of them already rejected
[14:54:03] <Carbonflux> how many slots do you have?
[14:54:11] <Renderwww> so did the word get out that cern internship is slave labour?
[14:54:24] <dukwon> they get 90 CHF a day
[14:54:49] <dukwon> Carbonflux, it depends on the number of proposed projects, but usually about 250
[14:55:07] <Carbonflux> yikes, thats really competitive.
[14:55:14] <Renderwww> 90 CHF? how many kebabs is that in swissland? 2.5?
[14:55:49] <Carbonflux> in the US we call them gradslaves.
[14:56:24] <dukwon> i used to get a 145 EUR per-diem when i went to CERN, and i found myself with about 50 left over each day
[14:56:38] <dukwon> so it's enough to cover daily expenses
[14:56:53] <Carbonflux> do they get lodging?
[14:57:22] <dukwon> not for free, but they stay in the CERN hostel
[14:57:57] <Carbonflux> it does sound kind of fun if you are young.
[14:58:16] <dukwon> yeah
[15:00:42] <Renderwww> imagine the nerd orgies going on all night every night!
[15:00:44] <dukwon> hmm. just realised that since i will be arriving at CERN around the same time as the summer students, i'll be competing with them for temporary accommodation 
[15:01:14] <Carbonflux> Thunderdome!!!
[15:01:28] <Carbonflux> sorry, that just came out.
[15:03:53] <jotham> funny https://mobile.twitter.com/EtoBuziashvili/status/1498071413848109056
[15:04:13] <Carbonflux> for me the excitement would be immersion in a culture with the sole goal of exploring the nature of reality, it would not matter if the primary assumptions we wrong, just the spirt itself would be enjoyable.
[15:04:21] <jotham> wonder if NYT has blocked russia from playing wordle
[15:04:43] <jotham> the dumb virtue signaling solidarity is getting increasingly hyperactive
[15:04:50] <jotham> oprah yanked war and peace from her book club
[15:04:55] <jotham> ... we're in the freedom fries phase
[15:04:58] <Carbonflux> lol
[15:04:59] <jotham> it's very silly
[15:05:30] <Renderwww> damn that Tolstoy guy, he laid the ideological groundwork for the invasion!
[15:06:00] <Carbonflux> well i for one refuse to give up on my Russian litrpg novels.
[15:11:18] <Carbonflux> it is interesting that the Russian gov has instituted geofencing, normally we are taught to be scared of Russian hackers. 
[15:12:10] <Carbonflux> The Russians do have a reputation of being among the most elite hackers from what i can tell.
