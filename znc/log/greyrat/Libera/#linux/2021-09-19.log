[07:55:39] <Gustavo6046> e.g. 3 2 add

[08:02:52] <Gustavo6046> the moment a monster creates a projectile, that has to be appended to the list of objcets
[08:03:11] <Gustavo6046> but how will that be done if the room for that is occupied by the thing above it in the stack (player info)?

[08:25:05] <Gustavo6046> I am a bit paranoid of this idea because those stacks with different roots would inevitably live in the same underlying memory so I could grow one so much so as to have it hit the back of another.

[10:03:47] <akoana> the same site says: "However, in the case of Layer III, frames are not always independant. Due to the possible use of the "byte reservoir", wich is a kind of internal buffer, frames are often dependent of each other. In the worst case, 9 input frames may be needed before beeing able to decode one single frame"

[10:06:53] <SineDeviance> the bit reservoir is used whenever CBR < 320kbit (and usually, ABR) are used to encode. because the set bitrate is considered for every frame, there will be some sections of songs that are too complex to be properly encoded within the limits of the chosen bitrate (meaning they need a higher bitrate.) the bit reservoir is intended to allow these portions to be encoded better

[10:16:26] <akoana> no wonder if you have reaper
[10:17:01] <akoana> SineDeviance: do you play an instrument?
[10:17:02] <SineDeviance> I picked reaper when I setup my studio back in 2012 after demoing a bunch of DAWs (including ardour, protools, cubase, reason, and so-on)
[10:17:22] <SineDeviance> it was a lot cheaper back then for a commercial license, I think I paid like $159 for it? Now it's $230 or so

[15:02:33] <BoraxMan> it is more secure this way, rather than allowing any arbitrary script to be run sudo
[15:02:41] <euouae> BoraxMan should I install luks.open and luks.close in one of those places?
[15:02:52] <BoraxMan> euouae, that would be the better option
[15:03:04] <extern> BoraxMan: sxic seems to be what i looked for thanks
[15:03:08] <BoraxMan> the other option is to add the path it is currently in (full path, don't use "~")
[15:03:21] <euouae> Thanks BoraxMan, I appreciate it
[15:03:23] <BoraxMan> but I wouldn't do that.  Any system wide tool that I create, I put in /usr/local/bin
[15:03:32] <euouae> yeah I'll put it there
[15:03:42] <Sauvin> euouae, can you execute stuff in ~/bin?
[15:03:50] <BoraxMan> not with suddo, no
[15:04:08] <euouae> -rwxr-xr-x are the right permissions for scripts there right?
[15:04:10] <Sauvin> BoraxMan, my echo $PATH thing works identically with or without sudo.
[15:04:28] <BoraxMan> yes, what I do, is put the script there, use those permissoin, and set owner as root

[15:05:14] <BoraxMan> Sauvin, yes, that is correct behaviour.  You are printing your own PATH, but echo is run as sudo.

[15:05:56] <Sauvin> BoraxMan, yo're not listening.
[15:06:19] <TJ-> Sauvin: because the shell expands $PATH /before/ calling sudo so you're actually doing "sudo echo /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games" not "sudo echo $PATH"
[15:06:29] <Sauvin> Oh, hell.
[15:06:32] <BoraxMan> TJ-, correct
[15:06:34] * Sauvin tests
[15:06:44] <TJ-> you need to do "sudo sh -c 'echo $PATH' "
[15:07:46] <Sauvin> BoraxMan, TJ-, I owe you one.
[15:07:52] <BoraxMan> or you coa run your script this way
[15:08:01] <euouae> TJ- do you remember that usb hard drive issue with uas and the usb_storage quirks?
[15:08:02] <BoraxMan> su -c "filename"

[15:34:54] <euouae> TJ- is this behavior only found in some distributions or do all distributions have initrd load the modules?
[15:35:35] <TJ-> Brumaire: I did that a different way; I store the detached header in a raw block device. I then use dmsetup to create a linear device with that block device and the LUKS container itself as a 'raid-0' linear stripe, which creates a /dev/mapper/device that looks like it a non-detached header :)
[15:36:21] <TJ-> euouae: initrd generally is supposed to only load modules required to access root file-system, but udev is also there and that will received device ADD events from kernel and load modules on demand

[18:19:11] <Helmholtz> So how difficult is it to launch a cloud business using openstack (meaning providing vps to people)
[18:19:22] <TJ-> OpenStack is an open-sourced version of what AWS, Gcloud, Azure et al do
[18:19:40] <ayecee> compared to what
[18:20:55] <Helmholtz> ayecee, like assume one wants to launch a startup to provide the same solutions that aws provides, but with openstack
[18:21:01] <ayecee> the easiest way to make a small fortune in the vps provider space is to start with a large fortune
[18:21:22] <ayecee> Helmholtz: seems like a weird assumption but okay
[18:21:37] <TJ-> Helmholtz: that's called being on a hiding to nothing
[18:21:39] <Helmholtz> what is the roadblock here? launching opensack is hard? writing a UI for it is hard?

[18:23:00] <Helmholtz> yeah from a marketting pov, it doesn't make sense...but I'm just asking about the technical difficulty here
[18:23:15] <ayecee> the whole point of openstack is to take something that's difficult and make it easier.

[18:26:56] <hexnewbie> Good news: You can use the questions from my teacher in ‘Operating Systems’ to test the candidates. For example, ask them “What does the following bash code do? $ set var 5”

[18:49:27] <trbp> question is why are the rich rich?
[18:49:28] <oerheks> 'stealing from the rich and giving to the poor' sounds like giving it back?

[18:50:29] <ayecee> well, not really an answer. more of a response.
[18:50:36] <trbp> ayecee: rethorical or not, aim was about that there will always be one more clever and the others eager to serve for his/her 'cleverness' ;)
[18:50:47] <hexnewbie> kfrench: Well, some people who seek help online will be pretty upset if you tried to teach them how to fish, they'd be all like “Cut the lecture and just give me the fish, dang it”

[19:37:21] <SineDeviance> then it's not a loopback interface

[19:43:34] <FragtioN> nope. just an empty brige with a /32
[19:43:49] <FragtioN> i suppose I could rather use a lo:0 ?
[19:44:15] <ayecee> okay. you can assign that to the loopback interface to the same effect. it still won't show up in ip route output, but that's not a requirement for ospf anyways.

[19:44:32] <ayecee> just wasn't clear what that was for.
[19:44:34] <FragtioN> yeah
[19:44:49] <FragtioN> the issue is just pushing the /32 out with ospf
[19:45:10] <ayecee> is there an issue with that?
[19:45:27] <FragtioN> i'm battling, is the issue xD
[19:45:50] <TJ-> FragtioN: best place to ask is, of course, #networking
[19:45:59] <FragtioN> ty & sorry for the noise
[19:46:01] <ayecee> so far as i know it should "just work" as is
[19:46:01] <SineDeviance> FragtioN: based on what you said above, you are using mikrotik routers and want to setup a wireguard site-to-site between them, yes?
[19:46:20] <ayecee> no reason to expect #networking to do any better on this.
[19:46:23] <ayecee> SineDeviance: no.
[19:46:24] <FragtioN> mikrotik to linux actually
[19:46:32] <SineDeviance> oh
[19:46:43] <FragtioN> well several mikrotik nodes and now a linux node to be precise, but for simplicity i didnt mention that at first
[19:46:44] <ayecee> has a wireguard site-to-site, wants to share routes via ospf.
[19:46:58] <ayecee> figures that ospf only shares routes visible in ip route output
[19:47:06] <ayecee> the last is the assumption that's the problem here
[19:47:10] <FragtioN> yeah
[19:47:19] <SineDeviance> okay, that makes more sense, yeah
[19:47:25] <FragtioN> well for the most part that's what it does right, filtering aside
[19:48:07] <ayecee> FragtioN: it shares routes it knows about. there's always an implied route to all local interfaces that is not explicitly listed.
[19:48:25] <ayecee> by ip route at least, but a routing daemon would still know about them.
[19:48:32] <FragtioN> so technically the /32 should implicitly be known
[19:48:35] <FragtioN> why doesn't it share it
[19:48:44] <TJ-> FragtioN: why not a /31 on-link for the PtP wireguard endpoints?
[19:48:45] <FragtioN> (...unless i add a static route)

[19:49:13] <ayecee> so, like, what software are you using for ospf
[19:49:38] <FragtioN> the /30's used for each wireguard endpoint links are propagating fine, my problem is memorizing those for several nodes, it's impractical, which is why I'm going the extra /32 layer, which works fine for the mikrotiks ...
[19:49:47] <ayecee> TJ-: because that address goes away when the link goes away
[19:50:21] <ayecee> that's why for setups like this, the extra addresses are assigned to lo or possibly an empty bridge interface like FragtioN has done

[19:52:07] <ayecee> okay, and how have you configured it
[19:52:18] <FragtioN> if there's a way to advertise a route explicitly in that cfg then that solves my problem
[19:52:43] <FragtioN> afaik it's only possible to filter what comes in from kernel/static/connected etc, needless to say the /32 i need isn't one of them

[20:43:15] <ayecee> it does if you boot it in efi mode
[20:43:16] <blackop> but why do i see 1gb (900 something mb) partition in windows?
[20:43:29] <TJ-> blackop: boot mode depends on what the PC chooses based on how it is configured
[20:43:37] <ayecee> blackop: two reasons.
[20:43:52] <blackop> well GRUB is working fine, i see GNU Linux and Windows boot manager in GRUB in EFI mode
[20:44:00] <ayecee> 1) you should only have one EFI partition. both windows and linux should use the same one.
[20:44:10] <ayecee> 2) you have the wrong GUID on the second partition you created.
[20:44:10] <TJ-> blackop: EFI-SP doesn't need to be any more than 128MB but for widespread compatibility is often set at 512MB
[20:44:21] <blackop> ayecee: 1st option make sound
[20:44:36] <blackop> maybe i shouldnt create separated ESP EFI partition in linux

[23:34:36] <noarb> When I use binwalk on a file, it lists some decimal offsets for the files it detects like this: https://bpa.st/3Y4A, is there a way to use head / tail combo to extract that part of the file? What I've tried doesn't seem to extract right. Is there an off-by-one error, or do I need to convert decimal to bytes differently? I'm trying to use something like tail -c+$offset inputfile | head -c$datalength >

[23:40:41] <Dagmar> Even if you buy an APU you'd probably better not be trying to use it for gaming beyond some really simple stuff
[23:40:55] <TJ-> https://www.amd.com/en/products/apu/amd-ryzen-7-3700u
[23:41:14] <dostoyevsky2> somehow it seems weird to see both amdgpu and nvidia in the lspci output
[23:41:27] <Dagmar> Mainly APUs are meant for people who are _not_ gamers and just need some _moderate_ 3D performance for things like 5-10-year-old games, and who don't want to buy a video card
[23:41:39] <Guest6969> for me it's Tongfang Hongkong Limited Device
