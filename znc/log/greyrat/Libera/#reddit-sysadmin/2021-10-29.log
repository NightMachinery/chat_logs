[06:28:04] <sd> 08<G​ene> i'd sooner train a neural network to play it than play it myself.
[06:28:13] <sd> 08<G​ene> actually, muzero + 2048
[06:28:14] <sd> 08<G​ene> hrm.
[06:28:16] <catbeard> so it goes on and on until you can't move blocks enough to beat it, my trick is keeping the biggest numbers in a snake pattern by keeping the largest number in the bottom left corner
[06:28:28] <sd> 08<G​ene> https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general
[06:28:39] <sd> 08<G​ene> i might try to actually write an implementation for muzero, that'd be fun.
[06:28:53] <sd> 08<G​ene> watch the AI that literally kicked the shit out of the AI that beat humans at Go .-.
[06:29:06] <sd> 08<G​ene> *learn how to play 2048
[06:29:26] <catbeard> i mean ya there might be other ways to beat it or be more efficient
[06:29:31] <catbeard> but that's the best way i know
[06:30:10] <catbeard> it takes a while to "line it up" to where you have 1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, then on the next row up going backwards 32, 16, 8, 4, 2
[06:30:17] <sd> 08<G​ene> yeah, i've played it a while
[06:30:19] <catbeard> that's playing 4x4 grid
[06:30:31] <sd> 08<G​ene> and the snake  method works until your axis you're using is filled up 😦
[06:31:01] <catbeard> yeah at that point just pull down or left until it fills and you get what you want in the direction it needs to go
[06:31:12] <catbeard> so only the second row up moves
[06:31:17] <catbeard> and just don't swipe up
[06:31:22] <sd> 08<G​ene> then a 2 spawns behind your 4096
[06:31:29] <sd> 08<G​ene> and you have to turn that 2 into a 8192
[06:31:33] <catbeard> so you don't risk a 2 appearing under your 1024
[06:31:38] <catbeard> LOL
[06:31:40] <sd> 08<G​ene> stuck axis is stuck
[06:31:54] <sd> 08<G​ene> you get literally 3 moves? D:
[06:31:57] <catbeard> stuck row yes, but you can still go left and right with the unfilled rows
[06:31:57] <sd> 08<G​ene> 4.
[06:31:58] <sd> 08<G​ene> i guess.
[06:32:29] <sd> 08<G​ene> ima play uplink and try to beat it.
[06:32:35] <catbeard> but it will combine from RTL if you swipe right
[06:32:40] <catbeard> and LTR when you swipe left
[06:32:50] <catbeard> but only the first pair
[06:33:35] *** Quits: signofzeta (~signofzet@user/signofzeta) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[06:33:36] <catbeard> or rather the pair closest to the end in the direction you swiped
[06:34:24] <catbeard> so if you have (x as blank) [ x 2 2 4 4 ] if you swiped right you'd have [ x x 2 2 8 ]
[06:34:39] <catbeard> instead of [ x x x 4 8 ] on the first swipe
[06:35:00] <catbeard> at least that's how i remember it working, might be wrong
[06:35:06] * SpookyGibby farts gibbyfarts.com
[06:35:43] <catbeard> but for each swipe you get a random 2 or 4 block
[06:36:11] <catbeard> if you got past the 32-bit integer limits, you could start spitting out randoms from 2 -> 64 maybe
[06:36:29] <catbeard> and would still be playable as 4x4 maybe
[06:36:38] <catbeard> haven't tried 8x8

[08:39:57] <JollyRgrs> i guess with your delays, yeah

[09:00:22] <csws> yeah I'm even worse than novice
[09:00:24] <JollyRgrs> i'm really confused at that select statement
[09:00:28] <csws> I almost never touch sql.. just seems like a little mistake there
[09:00:37] <SirSceptalot> I have absolutely no idea. There's a table growing out of control, this query was provided by Lansweeper support
[09:00:49] <JollyRgrs> i thought he said this was simple
[09:00:51] <JollyRgrs> lol
[09:01:15] <csws> the select on 13 just makes no sense lol
[09:01:41] <csws> well fuuuck
[09:01:56] <csws> gotta go help the telco guy get going with modern auth on EXO
[09:02:12] <csws> been avoiding it but I'm out of other oddjobs to do now
[09:02:25] <JollyRgrs> wouldn't you like...just run the query to get the table, store it in a temp-table, then run your select off of that or whatever?
[09:02:31] <JollyRgrs> i dunno... IANASQLGUY
[09:02:36] <JollyRgrs> i just use it to do stuff in SCCM
[09:02:42] <JollyRgrs> this is beyond my scope
[09:02:48] <SirSceptalot> context: This is for the Lansweeper database, it's growing out of control. There's a Ticket system in Lansweeper, and support says that's the cause. The htblnotes table is growing so much they're suspecting a ticket loop or something. This is supposed to give me the ticket number with the most notes added (or something like that)
[09:03:21] <csws> lmao
[09:03:29] <SirSceptalot> Not sure if that context helps in any way, SQL is magic to me :p
[09:03:29] <JollyRgrs> yeah, idk, that's not how i would do it at all... but i know very little of best practices and the powah of SQL commands
[09:03:36] <JollyRgrs> do you have any DBs at work?
[09:03:40] <JollyRgrs> err DBAs

[09:04:10] <JollyRgrs> yeah
[09:04:16] <csws> SirSceptalot: I'm like 90% sure if you change select to set at the start of 13 it'll work or something

[09:04:52] <JollyRgrs> he's gotta have a select before the from
[09:04:54] <csws> i'm now losing faith
[09:05:07] <JollyRgrs> if he changes line 13, 14 and 15 are thrown off more
[09:05:30] <csws> but on line 10 it already starts with select
[09:05:42] <csws> looked like this might be nested?
[09:05:45] <csws> but I just don't get it
[09:05:57] * SirSceptalot is unsure what to do or try now :p
[09:05:58] <JollyRgrs> normal way it goes "select * from sys.colums where whatever"

[09:42:13] <nobyk> AYYYY
[09:42:21] <jay-ros> saab copied the design with the early 2000s 93

[09:42:33] <nobyk> what
[09:42:38] <nobyk> HE LIVES
[09:42:42] <jay-ros> my dad had a saab, stupid car... indicator was on the wrong side
[09:42:53] <DrZak> wat
[09:43:02] <jay-ros> I kept washing the windows every time I changed lanes
[09:43:03] <DrZak> how old was that?
[09:43:19] <DrZak> isnt that stuff standardized for very long?
[09:43:31] <nobyk> maybe not in the us
[09:43:36] <nobyk> they do things differently
[09:43:38] <jay-ros> early 2000s I think? Maybe late 90s
[09:43:45] <DrZak> aha
[09:44:19] <jay-ros> he went from a honda prelude to the saab, no taste whatsoever
[09:45:24] <csws> nobyk: was it left or right?
[09:46:16] <csws> oh wait
[09:46:19] <csws> jay-ros: what side was it on?
[09:46:26] * csws needs glasses apparently
[09:46:37] <jay-ros> normally indicator's on the right
[09:46:40] <csws> yeah
[09:46:43] <csws> my subaru is like that
[09:46:44] <jay-ros> (above cruise control)
[09:46:46] <csws> but euro cars are opposite
[09:46:47] <jay-ros> it was on the left
[09:47:00] <jay-ros> yeah, as it's a euro car, it was on the wrong side :P
[09:47:08] <csws> bloody euros
[09:47:13] <DrZak> oh
[09:47:20] <SirSceptalot> who
[09:47:22] <SirSceptalot> tf
[09:47:24] <jay-ros> DrZak, not forgetting we're right hand drive

[09:47:38] <csws> lol
[09:47:42] <jay-ros> driver's seat is on the right in australia
[09:47:43] <DrZak> right
[09:47:45] <nobyk> Normally, the indicators are on the left you dingelings
[09:47:46] <jay-ros> yeah, right
[09:47:50] <csws> hmm
[09:47:53] <DrZak> but the shifting pattern is the same though, isnt it?
[09:47:58] <csws> what about american cars in america that are LHD? are they indicators on the right?
[09:48:04] <DrZak> so, first is left-top
[09:48:11] <DrZak> (unless you have doglegged gear)
[09:48:13] *** Joins: seednode4 (~seednode@user/seednode)
[09:48:13] <jay-ros> that's gears
[09:48:32] <jay-ros> we're talking blinky lane turn lights
[09:48:51] <DrZak> yea, i am asking if shifting gears in rhd is the same as lfd
[09:48:52] <DrZak> :D
[09:48:55] <csws> yeah they are
[09:48:59] <csws> 1st is top left
[09:49:22] <csws> hmm
[09:49:35] <csws> DrZak: is the clutch your rightmost pedal?
[09:49:45] <jay-ros> hahahah fuck that's a good question too :D
[09:49:48] <DrZak> no, that's accelerator
[09:49:52] <jay-ros> really not considered it
[09:50:04] <csws> oh weird eh
[09:50:16] <jay-ros> so clutch is door-side of the pedals??
[09:50:43] <jay-ros> not mirrored, just shifted across
[09:50:53] <DrZak> ye
[09:51:05] <DrZak> left clutch, center brake, right acceleerator
[09:51:31] <jay-ros> yeah we've got the same then
[09:51:43] <csws> tfw driving automatic
[09:51:49] <csws> only got an auto license
[09:52:23] <DrZak> :)
[09:52:35] <jay-ros> but you've driven a fwd car around with the handbrake on and maccas trays under the rear wheels, right?
[09:52:45] <jay-ros> that doesn't need a manual car
[09:53:05] <csws> stupid subaru and their stupid "all wheel drive" sabotages that
[09:53:10] <DrZak> :))

[09:54:28] <csws> tbh pretty jealous
[09:54:48] <jay-ros> those things are mental if it's what I think they are
[09:55:04] <jay-ros> yeahhhh I had some uber driver with one

[11:05:26] <DrZak> doubt that
[11:06:11] <DrZak> UPC has calculator on their site
[11:07:04] <DrZak> APC Back UPS Pro BX850M for instance can do 2 minutes at 500w load
[11:07:05] <DrZak> :)))
[11:08:57] <Cl0udNinja> yeah thats some bullshit advertising
[11:09:04] <Cl0udNinja> 'can last 150 minutes'
[11:09:10] <Cl0udNinja> *WHEN THERES NOTHING PLUGGED INTO IT
[11:09:37] <Cl0udNinja> thats pretty shitty tbh, I'm a mad now
[11:09:56] <SirSceptalot> Are you italian or something?

[11:13:15] <sd> 05<V​ALOS> Got here about 30mins ago, can't wait for the day to be over tbh
[11:14:33] <sd> 07<m​assacre> Why does active directory admin center not have the copy option?
[11:14:50] <Cl0udNinja> because you touch yourself at night
[11:15:01] <sd> 05<V​ALOS> don't pretend you don't Cl0ud
[11:15:06] <sd> 05<V​ALOS> we all know it
[11:15:08] <emag> Cl0udNinja: if it's claiming that *at the current load*, it's probably somewhat accurate. adding to the load, it'll be less. shutting down anything connected, it'll last more. I've had spstems last 180+ minutes, on a properly specced UPS
[11:15:11] <Cl0udNinja> what are you doing with your life you arent
[11:15:27] <Cl0udNinja> emag, no, on the box it said 'can run for 150 minutes'
[11:15:39] <sd> 07<m​assacre> Toxic answer
[11:16:15] <emag> Cl0udNinja: well, that's under their "ideal" test specs. I wouldn't rely on that. I'd rely on real-time monitoring.
[11:16:25] <Cl0udNinja> massacre because they didnt want to add it? you could probably get the output of the entire whatever object you're after and then make it a new one though
[11:16:46] <Cl0udNinja> emag, on the site at full load it says ~16 minutes
[11:16:51] <Cl0udNinja> which is FAR from 150
[11:16:58] <xe0n> hehe
[11:17:02] <Cl0udNinja> er sorry, at full its 4 minutes
[11:17:22] <Cl0udNinja> but anyway, thats a far cry from 150
[11:18:06] <sd> 05<V​ALOS> what will it run at 150? a raspberry pi?
[11:18:13] <xe0n> 4 minutes to shut down stuff gracefully when you lose power lol
[11:18:38] <Cl0udNinja> xe0n, at full load. at half I get 16ish minutes
[11:18:45] <xe0n> nice

[17:00:10] <sintax> the bot is there. it's just picking up the txt put in to discord and transferring here and vice versa.

[19:06:16] <ptaav> i'm supposed to shadow a new customer sometime. they're having issues with azure classic backup
[19:06:17] <vinrock> s/Layer8/pieceofshit
[19:06:28] <ptaav> and migrating to azure arm
[19:06:38] <ptaav> no idea what either issue is.
[19:06:39] <sintax> s/Layer8/Brokecrap
[19:06:42] <A-KO> I had to argue with a colleague at work that slack webhooks are unauthenticated
[19:06:44] <A-KO> he didn't believe me
[19:06:45] <A-KO> lol
[19:07:06] <A-KO> he was like "oh no slack webhooks are totally authenticated!"
[19:07:08] <ptaav> but the backup's been broken for 15 days and there's a ticket open with MS
[19:07:12] <A-KO> and I'm like "no they're not, here's slack's API docs."
[19:07:31] <mistiry> A-KO: yeah thats an easy google search, i'd think
[19:07:46] <A-KO> mistiry: it's because he wants to look good to the VP. Because they want to shit all over Teams
[19:08:00] <mistiry> i have zero experience with slack webhooks. i only started using slack a few months ago when i started the new job
[19:08:09] <ptaav> not that hard to do, honestly
[19:08:10] <A-KO> he was like "Teams doesn't have webhooks!" (our government version doesn't); I said "Even if we had them we'd have to disable them because they're unauthenticated."
[19:08:26] <A-KO> and he was like "oh well SLACK webhooks are authenticated!"
[19:08:28] <A-KO> so of course I googled
[19:08:30] <A-KO> they're not lol
[19:08:46] <A-KO> Slack has a way to obtain a webhook in an OAuth token exchange--but the actual HTTP post to the webhook is never authenticated.
[19:09:02] <A-KO> and I don't believe based on the data that the webhooks expire when obtained via oauth exchange
[19:09:17] <teh_f4ll3n> I did have to generate an API key to plug WHMCS into our Slack though
[19:09:35] <A-KO> Depending on what you want to do API keys/auth does need to happen. Same in Teams really
[19:09:39] <fritzwastaken> ugh. Why are employers making me do teams video interviews?!
[19:09:42] <A-KO> but webhooks are universally unauthenticated in most cases
[19:09:49] <fritzwastaken> Im ugly and my office is hideous!
[19:09:55] <mistiry> fritzwastaken: i mean, its either Teams or Zoom these days
[19:10:02] <teh_f4ll3n> fritzwastaken, they heard about your shitting hammock
[19:10:04] <A-KO> it's why the US Gov was like "no webhooks" on government tenants
[19:10:06] <fritzwastaken> or... the good ole phone
[19:10:34] <mistiry> idk, i imagine pure telephone interviews are quite rare these days

[19:48:50] <ptaav> sadly, foundation is stupid and sucks.
[19:49:16] <spiderman> I choose to believe that RMS lives in his own world and pokes his head out once in a while and says something stupid. I think his statement was just social ineptitude
[19:49:33] <ptaav> yeah. autistics are like that.
[19:50:03] <ptaav> unable to edit what they say according to socially appropriate norms

[19:53:03] <spiderman> DOMF: I don't recall exactly what he said, but when I read it, it seemed like one of those things that is open to interpretation. If you picture rms as a pedo (sorta deserved... look at him), then you'd think he was a pedo. Otherwise, you could argue that he meant something totally non-pedo-ish

[19:53:51] <DOMF> So very ambiguous right?

[21:09:37] <fritzwastaken> ah beer
[21:09:40] <yuken> cider.
[21:09:42] <SpookyGibby> how long has it been fermenting? 
[21:09:47] <yuken> a week now.
[21:10:47] <SpookyGibby> has it slowed down?
[21:10:50] <yuken> da
[21:11:04] <SpookyGibby> then its ready to rack
[21:11:22] <yuken> Are you sure about that?
[21:11:24] <yuken> cuz I don't think so.
[21:11:28] <SpookyGibby> its been 7 days?
[21:11:33] <yuken> yeah.
[21:11:42] <SpookyGibby> is it still bubbling a LOT?
[21:11:45] <SpookyGibby> or a little?
[21:11:50] <SpookyGibby> compared to a few days ago
[21:11:52] <yuken> I don't know how you'd define either so Iunno.
[21:11:57] <yuken> less than when it started.
[21:12:00] <fritzwastaken> I would wear the shit out of this hat
[21:12:02] <fritzwastaken> https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/knorva-hat-blue-50447338/
[21:12:11] <SpookyGibby> so its slowed down
[21:12:12] <Hobadee_> fritzwastaken, Not sure about your case, but I've asked interviewees about FSMO rules just to know that they *can* google them.  Hell, I tell them I don't know them off the top of my head, but I ask them what the general concept of the FSMO rules are.
[21:12:20] <SpookyGibby> usually you ferment for 5-9 days
[21:12:32] <SpookyGibby> you're at the sweet spot, and the sugars have mostly been eaten 
[21:12:32] <yuken> How do I prevent it from just exploding, SpookyGibby?
[21:12:37] <yuken> It's a glass bottle.
[21:12:47] <yuken> I can heat it up in a water bath after I carb it, maybe?
[21:12:47] <SpookyGibby> thats a chance you have to take
[21:12:53] <fritzwastaken> Hobadee_: yea that was the extent I could say. I couldnt define them one by one, but I explained their usefulness
[21:13:03] <SpookyGibby> no, you need the yeast to eat the sugar to carb it
[21:13:10] <yuken> SpookyGibby, yes yes - let them carb it, THEN water bath.
[21:13:12] <yuken> To kill the yeast.
[21:13:13] <fritzwastaken> and how to transfer them lol
[21:13:20] <SpookyGibby> you card it in the bottles
[21:13:25] <yuken> Won't be bottling.
[21:13:28] <yuken> Don't have any bottles.
[21:13:39] <Hobadee_> fritzwastaken, Basically if I get an answer of "No FSMO, no AD.  I'll google the rest."  I'm happy.  :'-D
[21:14:04] <yuken> actually
[21:14:14] <SpookyGibby> ...
[21:14:18] <yuken> I do have some aluminium bottles, basically soda cans with a twist-on lid, that are designed to be reused.
[21:14:21] <yuken> I could... in theory use them.
[21:14:25] <SpookyGibby> what are you going to drink it out of?
[21:14:28] <ptaav> i've seen questions about fmso in several interviews
[21:14:32] <yuken> SpookyGibby, a glass, duh.
[21:14:42] <SpookyGibby> but... what are you going to carb it in?
[21:14:55] <ptaav> i don't get why it's the go to except that it's not well known/no longer used?
[21:15:00] <yuken> The jug it's in, SpookyGibby.
[21:15:11] <SpookyGibby> the carboy?!
[21:15:17] <yuken> I have a rubber stopper & airlock in it, but the jug also has a cap.
[21:15:21] <Hobadee_> fritzwastaken, Hell, if I got a candidate who knew them all by heart and new how to transfer them by heart, I would be suspicious of why he knew them so well... Like, how fucked up is your AD that you're doing that on a regular basis?
[21:15:25] <ptaav> and i could be wrong there too..i just answer "no idea, i have to google"
[21:15:50] <SpookyGibby> yuken: thats a terrible idea
[21:15:56] <yuken> why tho SpookyGibby.
[21:16:01] <SpookyGibby> a carboy isn't a pressure vessel like a bottle is
[21:16:08] <fritzwastaken> Hobadee_: lool. yea I basically said without FSMO there is no domain. I explained the transfer process from one old DC to a new one
[21:16:09] <yuken> hmm.
[21:16:21] <ThatOneRoadie> Yeah, carbonating in a carboy is a great way to find a mess a week later
[21:16:23] <yuken> SpookyGibby, these aluminium bottles were filled with sparkling water, AKA. pressure...?
[21:16:24] <yuken> Would... that work?
[21:17:00] <ThatOneRoadie> Get refillable glass bottles
[21:17:06] <ThatOneRoadie> like actual beer bottles
[21:17:13] <yuken> ThatOneRoadie, well too late for that now lol.
[21:17:19] <ThatOneRoadie> lol
[21:17:23] <Hobadee_> ptaav, It's a question because it's not well known, yet still incredibly important to how AD functions.  FMSO rules nuke, your AD is fucked and you gotta fix it.  It's pretty stable, so that why lots of people don't know about it.  Just makes sure you know more than a basic understanding of things.
[21:17:26] <yuken> I have... plastic soda bottles too.
[21:17:41] <SpookyGibby> You need beer bottles and caps man
[21:17:59] <yuken> SpookyGibby, I'll get some smh. But for now, I'll use these aluminium bottles that were for sparkling water.
