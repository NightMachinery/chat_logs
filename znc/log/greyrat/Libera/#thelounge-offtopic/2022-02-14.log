[04:13:18] <MaxLeiter> if you share some numbers / facts it'd probably be more welcome. people love founders / profitable side-ventures
[04:13:45] <MaxLeiter> but ive had my website get 100k+ views from being on the frontpage 
[04:13:52] <MaxLeiter> cant imagine you wouldn't get some conversions
[04:14:02] <johncs> for sure, with numbers like that i'm sure I would
[04:14:12] <MaxLeiter> (and the auto-tweeting/auto-sharing bots are relentless, so you get some free SEO for a good few months after) 
[04:14:14] <johncs> I've had some blog posts go to the front page before
[04:14:33] <johncs> hmmm... well i might wait a bit until sharing. I think HN's hug of death would take down my site honestly
[04:14:48] <MaxLeiter> what are you hosting on?
[04:15:02] <johncs> Digital Ocean
[04:15:31] <johncs> Requests are served directly from the server there. I don't have an intermediary CDN or anything. Though some bigger static assets are on their equivalent of S3
[04:15:31] <xnaas> I haven't been able to get Reddit to death hug me yet üò¢
[04:15:43] <xnaas> but most everything I host is boring static shit, I guess
[04:16:03] <MaxLeiter> ah yeah, that could be a problem
[04:16:04] <johncs> I just need to get the remaining static assets into S3 and I think I'd be able to survive most loads
[04:16:16] <johncs> Notably the JS assets, which are meaty, are not
[04:16:17] <MaxLeiter> ive entirely bought into static-first/serverless in the past few years 
[04:16:27] <johncs> For sure, it's way convenient
[04:16:37] <MaxLeiter> could also use cloudflare and avoid messing with aws d:
[04:17:07] <johncs> I've been trying to be really careful about privacy, so I don't really wanna funnel things through cloudfare
[04:17:19] <johncs> it'd make things easier for sure though
[04:17:21] <MaxLeiter> understandable 
[04:17:48] * xnaas all-in on Cloudflare
[04:17:50] <xnaas> fuck it
[04:18:04] <johncs> Only external thing is from Stripe, and I even went through the trouble of sandboxing their influence. They only get anything loaded when payment forms are on screen, and then I force the site to reload and purge it all when the payment form goes away
[04:18:45] <johncs> Can't imagine it's worth it honestly üòÖ, but makes me feel a bit better
[04:19:17] <johncs> Haha cloud fare is great, i feel you. I've definitely used them as well.
[04:19:32] <johncs> Hard to beat what they give you for free
[04:20:04] <xnaas> I don't understand enough about traffic flow to know what they could really get
[04:20:22] <xnaas> Like, when they talk to me, it's over HTTPS
[04:20:25] <xnaas> so idk
[04:20:46] <xnaas> (just for their basic proxy service)
[04:20:54] <johncs> It's been awhile... but I'm pretty sure they terminate the user's HTTPS connection
[04:21:01] <johncs> If so, they'd have access to everything
[04:21:05] <xnaas> ah
[04:21:11] <xnaas> oh well
[04:21:12] <xnaas> worth it
[04:21:14] <xnaas> :P
[04:21:31] <johncs> They wouldn't be able to know which page the user was requesting otherwise, especially with HTTP 2+ connections
[04:21:40] <johncs> (since a single connection can serve multiple pages)
[04:22:56] <johncs> Though maybe there's been a spec for bringing the path out into plaintext ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I haven't been following HTTP3. I know the name of the host is out in plaintext usually now.
[04:23:14] <xnaas> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[04:23:35] <johncs> Bah, I miss networking. I want more lifetimes to fuck around with stuff.
[04:23:40] <xnaas> I suppose if I was doing anything genuinely private I might care more. Or handling other people's data, like you are.
[04:29:53] <johncs> for sure. I'm glad I'm not handling too much, and Shmeppy isn't responsible for anyone livelihood or anything. That was one of the conditions I had for whatever venture I was going to pursue: nothing that people would be making a living with.
[04:30:10] <johncs> Didn't want that kind of responsibility üòÖ.
[04:30:33] <johncs> Still tryna be responsible with what I have taken on though... no need to contribute too much the privacy nightmare of the web.
[04:32:53] <xnaas> totally understand
[04:33:15] <xnaas> all the shit I host like nitter and bibliogram and such; there's tons of instances, so if someone wants a non-cloudflare one, they can get it :D
[04:34:41] <johncs> oh neat, I only head about nitter recently
[04:34:59] <johncs> are you hosting nitter.net?
[04:35:07] <xnaas> no
[04:35:12] <xnaas> I host nitter.actionsack.com
[04:35:17] <xnaas> and everything linked on actionsack.com
[04:35:34] <xnaas> (except github hosts status.actionsack.com for obvious reasons)
[04:36:03] <johncs> ooo very cool
[04:36:07] <xnaas> I serve like 3 million requests a week through my nitter, it's kinda wild
[04:36:16] <johncs> oh damn, that is
[04:36:19] <xnaas> I want to talk to more nitter hosters and see what kinda traffic they're serving
[04:36:21] <xnaas> because like
[04:36:22] <xnaas> holy hell
[04:36:34] <johncs> Yeah seriously, that's huge
[04:36:48] <johncs> I wonder how many requests Shmeppy gets.. can't imagine it's anywhere near that
[04:36:56] <xnaas> bibliogram is like 100k/wk tops lol ‚Äî but it also works like shit vs nitter
[04:37:02] <xnaas> since facebook and instagram are assholes
[04:37:06] <johncs> lol for sure
[04:41:57] <xnaas> and everything after that doesn't make it anywhere near 10k/wk even
[04:42:12] <xnaas> I'd be curious to see how something like teddit or libreddit or whatever did
[04:42:38] <xnaas> in terms of raw bandwidth though, Plex puts everything else to shame
[04:42:44] <xnaas> light months being ~1TB :P
[04:48:53] <johncs> goddam
[04:55:48] <xnaas> :D
[04:56:02] <xnaas> ISP hasn't shut me down yet (after >5 years); so it must be fine :)
[05:50:40] * xnaas departs #thelounge before getting too offtopic
[05:50:47] <xnaas> human üß† be wild
[07:09:19] <MaxLeiter> good luck on the job app
[07:14:15] <xnaas> Submitted earlier. It's no dream job by any means, but trying to get full-time with benefits before I turn 26 in April and can't mooch my parents' health insurance any more...ah American. üòé
[07:14:29] <xnaas> -n
[07:14:40] <xnaas> Thank you, though. üëè
[07:15:23] <xnaas> I just want my sick government bennies damnit. :P
[07:15:50] <xnaas> If it doesn't work out, though, I'll just go back to the private sector and copious amount of alcohol. ü§™
[08:59:12] <fnutt> In Norway no matter how much you use your doctor, hospitals or medicines, you pay up to a maximum of 329 USD a year. Rest is paid by the government. Kt does not matter if you are employeed or not. 
[09:00:06] <fnutt> I like it. Those that have high income pays a little more to help those with low income, and the differences between eich and poor levels out to some degree. 
[09:02:42] <fnutt> If you pay a private doctor you may get some help quicker. But if it is severe and you need help noe, the public hospitals are there for you. (there are no private hospitals)
[09:03:29] <fnutt> I hope the US and other countries can learn from this. Same with school. 
[09:07:50] <fnutt> Also, e.g. if you are pregnant, it is all free on hospitals and medicines no matter what. And childrens are paid for the first 16 years if I remember correctly.
[09:09:11] <fnutt> 329 USD a year isn‚Äôt much‚Ä¶. But it can be for some‚Ä¶. And because of this pregnant and childrens should go for free and not be sibjected to questions about economy within families.

[22:26:49] <xnaas> speaking of bug finding...I kept to type up a very long, detailed one for Mozilla later :P
[22:28:05] <xnaas> There's a very specific set of circumstances that prevents an m4a file from playing. Will probably get closed as a "won't fix" but :P
[22:28:21] <xnaas> (couldn't get the issue to trigger with any other type of audio file)
[22:32:48] <xnaas> Firefox seems to try and load audio/mp4 mime-typed m4as as a video first and that seems to cause some fun issues. üòÖ
[22:34:23] <xnaas> (actually, affects audio/x-m4a too so :D)
