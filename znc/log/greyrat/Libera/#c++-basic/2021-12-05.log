[21:18:17] <CaCode> Dear Sirs and Madams is there a Node class in the std or a Node type in c++?
[21:18:19] <CaCode> https://pastebin.com/hcBEzyN2
[21:18:31] <CaCode> i am implementing a linked list to learn what it is and how it works in detail
[21:18:47] <CaCode> but i am thrown off by the class that implements Node including a type node
[21:18:53] <CaCode> i marked it in the paste
[21:19:01] <CaCode> is this self referential or recursive?
[21:19:22] <CaCode> Node* next is an instance of the class Node?
[21:19:35] <CaCode> i mean a pointer to an instance of this class?
[21:20:07] <CaCode> I am sorry if this is sort of a beginner question
[21:23:29] <PJBoy> there is no node class in stdlib, though it does have a linked list class that uses nodes under the hood
[21:23:55] <PJBoy> `Node* next` is indeed a pointer to the next node in the linked list
[21:24:01] <PJBoy> or nullptr if there are no more nodes
[21:25:45] <PJBoy> as for self referential / recursive, idk that's subjective I guess
[21:26:07] <PJBoy> if you have 10 people in a line all pointing at the person in front of them, is that a recursive human structure?
[21:28:14] <CaCode> PJBoy, the Node mentioned in paste pointer declaration is the same Node that this class is being defined there?
[21:28:34] <CaCode> Class somename{ somename* next;}?
[21:28:37] *** Joins: Inline (~Inline@2a02:908:1252:7a80::133)
[21:28:45] <CaCode> class i mean
[21:29:02] <PJBoy> yeah there's just the one Node type
[21:29:24] <PJBoy> the same way a line of humans are all the same type
[21:29:38] <CaCode> I see so I can use the custome type i am defining in its definition...
[21:29:57] <PJBoy> you can use the type you're defining before its definition is complete in limited ways
[21:30:04] <CaCode> I see
[21:30:14] <PJBoy> namely you can have a pointer or reference to an "incomplete type"
[21:30:18] <CaCode> thank you for walking me through this, i suspected as much but wanted to make sure I get it
[21:30:41] <CaCode> is this pointer to an instance or basically an object of this class, or is it a pointer to the class itself?
[21:30:42] <PJBoy> because those things don't need to know things like e.g. how large the class is, as it doesn't need to allocate space for it
[21:30:55] <CaCode> this is a pointer to an instance of this type, right?
[21:30:58] <PJBoy> indeed
[21:31:36] <PJBoy> (or nullptr if there's no object instance to point to)
[21:31:48] <CaCode> in memory there is a place where this class's code is stored ant htis is pointing to that,
[21:32:01] <CaCode> ok so not what i just said
[21:32:16] <CaCode> but an object of that type that is or a nullpointer
[21:32:18] <CaCode> i see
[21:32:53] <CaCode> thank you for walking me through this, I really appreciate it
[21:33:22] <PJBoy> happy to help
[21:33:49] <CaCode> PJBoy, may I ask something offtopic: at what point can somebody say to an employer in a resumee "I know C++"?
[21:33:59] *** Joins: meator (~meator@user/meator)
[21:34:14] <CaCode> can i say it after I have build a project with it that uses several parts of the std or do I need to know all of c++?
[21:34:35] <CaCode> I mean a lot of interviews seem to think memorizing the std is the same as being able to use it
[21:34:36] <PJBoy> you certainly don't need to know all of C++
[21:34:51] <PJBoy> a project using several parts of stdlib is great
[21:35:02] <PJBoy> a project using a 3rd party library is also great
[21:35:04] <CaCode> so if i have avoided templates so far, eventhough i have read that chapter in my book back then i can say i know c++?
[21:35:13] <CaCode> i did both
[21:35:15] <Alipha> I would avoid the phrase "I know c++". Instead, "I have experience with c++" or something
[21:35:35] <PJBoy> you should know the basics of templates
[21:35:52] <PJBoy> and have a firm grasp on the object oriented parts of C++
[21:35:55] <CaCode> Alipha how about " i am aware of the existence of a language refered to c++ and have used its core features and some of the std"
[21:36:09] <PJBoy> and experience writing resource handling classes
[21:36:14] <CaCode> I know how to use templates but I never use them in any of my code
[21:36:14] <Alipha> That's rather wordy
[21:36:33] <CaCode> for example I used function templates in the pastebin i just posted but that's about it
[21:37:34] <CaCode> PJBoy, i am not so familiar with all the jargon, what are resource handling classes?
[21:37:50] <CaCode> something like a class to handle coms with a db?
[21:37:53] <CaCode> if so then i did that
[21:38:01] <PJBoy> a class where you hold a resource that needs special handling to clean up
[21:38:11] <CaCode> i see
[21:38:11] <PJBoy> DB handle is a good example yeah
[21:38:22] <CaCode> but could also be hardware?
[21:38:31] <PJBoy> and probably also needs special handling to copy the class etc
[21:38:45] <PJBoy> something where you leak the resource if you do the class wrong
[21:39:23] <CaCode> thank you again I know this is offtopic, but i just have been starting to question myself as interviews mostly ask if i memorized something, which i didn't think i needed as a programmer as you can always look up things in the reference and documentation
[21:39:35] <PJBoy> what country are you in?
[21:39:45] <CaCode> I am in the EU
[21:40:03] <CaCode> but I am looking to move to Canada if I find a job
[21:40:34] <PJBoy> then yeah, any decent employer wouldn't want you to have memorised all the docs / references
[21:40:44] <PJBoy> or specific algorithms or anything
[21:41:09] <PJBoy> I say "decent" ofc
[21:41:15] <CaCode> I am learning all the common algos and datastructures aswell as some systemdesign for the interviews
[21:41:29] <CaCode> and it is all fun, but i am not programming on my projects because of this
[21:41:49] <CaCode> i feel like theory is important and if you didnt go to school for cs you lack in that department
[21:42:00] <CaCode> so i am trying to play catch up
[21:42:26] <PJBoy> good idea
[21:42:50] <CaCode> hopefully i can get a job even though i am 'just' a programmer and not a CS
[21:43:02] <PJBoy> employers generally want a pretty good mix of programming skills
[21:43:09] <PJBoy> and most of those skills aren't taught in CS
[21:43:20] <PJBoy> using tools, debugging, testing
[21:43:26] <PJBoy> software design
[21:43:28] <CaCode> Oh, I see, then I think I will be fine once i get a job and can prove myself
[21:43:39] <CaCode> i am good with debugging and using tools
[21:43:55] <CaCode> software design is not my forte i used my idiosyncratic method before
[21:44:13] <CaCode> using single concern classes that communicate with each other
[21:44:35] <CaCode> worked for me but i already bough gang of four
[21:44:54] <CaCode> haven't had a chance to read it yet as i am going through algos and ds
[21:45:42] <PJBoy> worth getting a hold on concurrency and cache too
[21:45:55] <CaCode> are assert statements and try - catch all there is to testing short of using boost or other librarys?
[21:46:24] <CaCode> I see, I have had a read up on threads in c++ witht the types of locks
[21:46:29] <CaCode> but not caching
[21:46:32] <PJBoy> when I say testing, I do mean using a testing framework of some kind
[21:46:33] <CaCode> thanks for the advice
[21:46:41] <PJBoy> something where you can automate your testing
[21:46:49] <CaCode> I see, I will try to familiarize myself with boost testing
[21:47:13] <CaCode> PJBoy, what would you say is the most common testing framework for c++?
[21:47:42] <PJBoy> for unit tests, I'd probably recommend doctest or catch2
[21:47:57] <PJBoy> anything that works is good though
[21:48:22] <PJBoy> google unit tests might be the most common one?
[21:48:40] <PJBoy> once you use one, you've used them all
[21:48:45] <PJBoy> it's not super important
[21:49:33] <CaCode> I see
[21:49:38] <CaCode> again thank you so much
[21:50:01] <PJBoy> :)
