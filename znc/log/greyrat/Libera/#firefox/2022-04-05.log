[17:45:22] <MJCD> oh it just works via their site, that's great thanks a bunch
[17:46:20] <Caspy7[m]> MJCD: yeah, I'm connect to their matrix as well as this room via https://chat.mozilla.org/
[17:46:29] <MJCD> so um
[17:46:43] <MJCD> do I really want my matrix account to be hosted by moz?
[17:46:47] <MJCD> can I change it later?
[17:46:57] <MJCD> I intend to self host eventually
[17:47:15] <MJCD> sorry I know this isn't #matrix but figured y'all might know if you're using it
[17:47:35] <Caspy7[m]> I don't know if you can create an account with one server then "move" that. Doubt that's possible
[17:48:19] <MJCD> This stuff is why i've been putting it off because I need to do it /right/ lol
[17:48:31] <Caspy7[m]> there's, um, the matrix server (matrix.to? I'd have to look it up), don't know that either is "better" than the other for creating an account thou
[17:48:35] <MJCD> have asked in the matrix chan -- thanks for the link
[17:48:43] <MJCD> well yea but again I intend to self host later so
[17:48:58] <MJCD> aka I should be hosting my own matrix account heh
[17:49:25] <MJCD> it's just kind of a massive liability to me to trust such a thing to a third party for //ALL// media

[17:55:32] <susi> irc is the way
[17:55:33] <MJCD> having then at the end of that looking at matrix; it was like, fine for the job
[17:55:43] <MJCD> some things i'd change but nothing too drastic
[17:55:58] <MJCD> and yea IRC is great i've implemented the full RFC many times over :D

[22:35:14] <alguien> It would help if I could debug, but I can’t. i don’t know why
[22:35:16] <MJCD> er in another channel sorry
[22:35:20] <MJCD> "Can't"
[22:35:21] *** Joins: anotheryou (uid257186@user/anotheryou)
[22:35:26] <MJCD> > Not with that attitude xD
[22:35:31] <MJCD> everything is debuggable :D
[22:35:55] * alguien imagines MJCD’s hand reaching out to grab me from the lower levels
[22:35:59] <MJCD> a very common debugging thing is just to add a bunch of output at various stages of a thing working
[22:36:13] <MJCD> then you can literally see in the console exactly what's going on
[22:36:37] <alguien> if I alert() a window appears… not the alert window
[22:36:46] *** Joins: cvmn (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman)
[22:36:49] <alguien> a console.log has no effect
[22:36:57] <MJCD> ie log('ABOUT TO RUN X'); log(x()); log(THING HAS WORKED);
[22:37:07] <MJCD> what context is this running in
[22:37:13] <MJCD> you mentioned extensions verrry briefly
[22:37:28] <alguien> yes, it’s a background script
[22:37:32] <alguien> I’m using this btw: https://open-vsx.org/extension/firefox-devtools/vscode-firefox-debug
[22:37:38] <MJCD> okay so it's outside the `page` context.
[22:37:42] <alguien> I’ll try seeing if I misconfigured it perhaps
[22:37:50] *** Quits: icar (~icar@22.red-79-153-20.dynamicip.rima-tde.net) (Quit: icar)
[22:37:51] <alguien> yes, both sending and receiving
[22:37:55] <MJCD> so it can't console.log because it doesn't have a console
[22:37:55] <alguien> (for now)
[22:37:59] <MJCD> right you can send it to the page context
[22:38:01] <alguien> kinda
[22:38:02] <MJCD> that's fine heh
[22:38:12] <MJCD> just inject a script that does an event
[22:38:37] <MJCD> inject('<script>console.log(thing)</script'>); style even
[22:38:39] <MJCD> not ideal
[22:38:49] <alguien> inject where?
[22:38:51] <alguien> on the page?
[22:38:54] <MJCD> to the page context
[22:39:03] <MJCD> hang on I think google have a good doc explaining this
[22:39:03] <MJCD> sec
[22:39:08] <alguien> but what is the thing it would log?
[22:39:31] <MJCD> as above literally anything to show you what's actually going on
[22:39:42] <MJCD> if you already specifically know what's going wrong, ask about that
[22:39:43] <alguien> iirc I tried alerting browser.runtime.sendMessage in the page context, it it was native code
[22:39:47] <MJCD> how about literally any code
[22:40:00] <MJCD> and you wouldn't usually do it through the BROWSER runtime
[22:40:05] <MJCD> you do it through the PAGE CONTEXT 
[22:40:10] <MJCD> hold up again trying to find
[22:40:11] <alguien> I posted the three whole lines above! :D
[22:41:18] <MJCD> this isn't what I was looking for but covers the topic adequately
[22:41:19] <MJCD> https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/Chrome-Extension-run-JavaScript-in-the-context-of-the-current-page
[22:41:20] <alguien> This whole thing started because I wanted the page script and the background script to communicate. so it’s going to have to be through the browser runtime i reckon
[22:41:39] <MJCD> tldr there's a background context ie extensions, a browser context, and a page context
[22:41:46] <MJCD> all three are separated JS VM's
[22:42:02] <MJCD> only the page context is actually connected to the DOM
[22:42:07] <MJCD> and dev tools etc
[22:42:29] <MJCD> if you want to say, log a thing then, you need to both send it to the page context which is connected to said dev tools
[22:42:37] <alguien> i thought the extension context was connected too - just not the same… well, context
[22:42:38] <MJCD> and then actually action that request inside the page context
[22:42:47] <alguien> but that’s the catch
[22:42:51] <MJCD> if the page isn't yours, you can inject scripts into the page context
[22:43:03] <MJCD> or if it is heh
[22:43:06] <MJCD> either way
[22:43:23] <alguien> wish my debugger worked :(
[22:43:40] <MJCD> it's basically monkeypatching so not generally recommended -- ideally have it do proper IPC ie sendMessage and ofc most importantly, the handler for that on the page context
[22:43:46] <alguien> I may try grabbing the context manually in the background like you suggested and then injecting things
[22:43:47] <MJCD> you cannot have one sided ipc
[22:44:10] <MJCD> that would lead to rampant remote code execution (RCE)
[22:44:27] <alguien> not sure what you’re trying to say now
[22:44:39] <alguien> my background script should be able to send messages to itself, should it not?
[22:44:45] <alguien> *for itself to handle
[22:44:48] <MJCD> to itself? Sure, you can
[22:44:54] <MJCD> but that still wont be able to console.log
[22:45:02] <MJCD> because it's an entirely separate context
[22:45:06] <alguien> of cour… that’s what we’re talking about
[22:45:23] <MJCD> you can do it, for other stuff, but it's again not terribly useful
[22:45:34] <MJCD> you'd probably just <do the thing> if it can be done in that context
[22:45:40] <alguien> lemme try something
[22:45:58] <MJCD> like showing some minimalist example code? :P
[22:46:04] <alguien> i know, i just wanted it not to cross boundaries just so i can prove it works (but it doesn't)
[22:46:18] <MJCD> It will work, but how I described for output and stuff
[22:46:32] <MJCD> because again, every context is separated by being in an entirely different VM
[22:46:40] <MJCD> grouped by the browser engine by intent
[22:46:42] <alguien> if it worked, I’d see a result in the button icon changing
[22:46:45] <MJCD> which is a whole other topic
[22:46:52] <alguien> something’s amiss and my debugger is useless
[22:46:53] <MJCD> I don't doubt it's "not working"
[22:46:58] <MJCD> that's just pretty meaningless
[22:46:59] <MJCD> lol
[22:47:13] <MJCD> it doesn't give me any info to help you specifically
[22:47:18] <alguien> the icon does change when I’m invoking stuff directly
[22:47:21] <MJCD> so, first step is to get <some info>
[22:47:31] <MJCD> even if it's just console.logs when <anything> happens
[22:47:37] <alguien> first step is to get the debugger working :P
[22:47:41] <MJCD> allowing you to exactly trace execution order
[22:47:46] <MJCD> the debugger is fine
[22:47:47] <MJCD> but again
[22:47:54] <alguien> it’s not, it’s ded
[22:47:58] <MJCD> is not in any way attached to your extension except via IPC
[22:48:12] <MJCD> ie sendMessage/recvMessage or whatever
[22:48:30] <alguien> you’re suggesting the debugger is unable to debug background scripts?
[22:48:32] <MJCD> the latter whatever the function actually is -- probably an event handle
[22:48:38] *** Quits: kicken (~Kicken@23.138.176.127) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[22:48:47] <alguien> just because they’re not executing in the page context?
[22:48:52] <MJCD> has to register within itself that it's ready to recieve X type message
[22:49:01] <MJCD> else it does literally nothing and is ignored
[22:49:02] <MJCD> and yes
[22:49:27] <alguien> surely background stuff can be debugged too?
[22:49:35] <MJCD> the debugger has //nothing to do// with background scripts but I think you CAN open a debugger instance for it if the extension offers its own page context or whatever
[22:49:36] <alguien> you said everything can be debugged :P
[22:49:43] <MJCD> it can, just not how you're trying to clearly
[22:49:52] <alguien> why not?
[22:49:55] <alguien> i think it should
[22:49:56] <MJCD> and tbf it IS a bit more random than regular debugging
[22:49:59] <MJCD> again
[22:50:21] <alguien> let me try breaking in the page context, sec
[22:50:22] <MJCD> if your page offers a uhh, page context I forget how they do that exactly but you can do it ie the window that pops up when you click it
[22:50:30] <MJCD> you CAN open ANOTHER debugger in there
[22:50:43] <MJCD> but i'm unsure as to how effective that is
[22:50:56] <MJCD> honestly every extension i've ever worked on, we just forward it all to the page context
[22:51:00] <MJCD> and let it sort it out
[22:51:19] <MJCD> again which is fine when I write the page as well and can just add an event handler for messages over IPC
[22:51:30] <MJCD> but if I don't, then I need to inject said handler into the page context
[22:51:38] <alguien> the debugger ignores breakpoints in my content_script as well
[22:51:50] <MJCD> content_script still isn't "page context"
[22:51:51] <MJCD> haha
[22:52:14] <MJCD> I believe that script is actually where you can work with the popup it generates when you click the icon
[22:52:15] <alguien> isn’t it? isnt its window the page’s window etc?
[22:52:27] *** Joins: The_Loko (~The_Loko@79.116.41.227)
[22:52:35] <MJCD> so you can output stuff there, or right click inspect and have a second debugger
[22:52:39] <MJCD> pop it out into a window even
[22:52:48] <MJCD> It may not still report background.js stuff without IPC
[22:52:53] <alguien> of course
[22:52:54] <MJCD> i'm really not 100% sure
[22:53:02] <alguien> i think it’s in the same context as the page
[22:53:08] <MJCD> I've only made like 5 things as extensions
[22:53:13] <MJCD> and no, it's not
[22:53:15] <MJCD> afaik
[22:53:18] <MJCD> find docs
[22:54:33] <alguien> i can console.log from the content_script
[22:55:50] <alguien> all this running in circles made me hungry
[22:56:13] <alguien> alguien: I may try grabbing the context manually in the background like you suggested and then injecting things
[22:56:19] <alguien> but I’m not going to like it :(
