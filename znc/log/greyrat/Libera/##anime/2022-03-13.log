[00:52:56] <DPA> Is there an isekai anime where the protagonist uses his knowledge of his old world to completely transform his new world technologically?
[00:55:18] <Leo--> No Game No Life I think.
[00:55:30] <Bco1981_2> season 2 confirmed
[00:55:38] <Nanobot> Technologically? I'm not sure. Realistic Hero is sort of that, but more geopolitically rather than technologically.
[00:55:45] <Nanobot> *Realist
[00:56:21] <Nanobot> I mean.... unless you count Bookworm... but that's kind of on a smaller scale.
[00:57:18] <DPA> I've already seen all those. I really want it to be technologically. If it used magic instead it'd be fine too. Imagine inventing a magic internet, magic web shops, and stuff.
[00:57:31] <Nanobot> Like, she started out trying to make paper (which already existed, but wasn't available to poor people like her). Season 3 is about to start, and she's trying to invent a printing press.
[00:58:09] <DPA> Yes, I know, I already saw it.
[00:58:23] <DPA> It goes in the right direction.
[00:59:10] <Nanobot> Outbreak Company tries to bring otaku culture to another world.
[00:59:40] <Bco1981_2> i like the maid Muycel ot something like that.
[00:59:45] <Bco1981_2> or*
[01:00:13] <Bco1981_2> i would take her home in a big bag if i could.
[01:02:31] <Nanobot> "I'm a half-elf, which in this world means everyone hates me and is allowed to beat me and whip me. What? You don't want to hurt me? You think I'm cute and have value? Shuki!"
[01:02:32] <DPA> Another idea. No Game No Life had the concept of rules or conditions being enforced to some extent during or as a result of winning a game. It'd be interesting to see an anime which specifically explores the creation, and implication, of systems working to some specification.

[01:05:51] <Nanobot> Outbreak Company is one of the older isekai series, back when people referred to isekai series as "SAO clones", and it wasn't clear whether there was even any demand for them.
[01:06:25] <Bco1981_2> and it's not exactly a clone
[01:06:30] <Nanobot> (yes, I know there were isekai series before SAO, but SAO is what turned it into a 'genre' of sorts)
[01:06:46] <DPA> I avoided Death Note so far, I though it was only about killing by writing names in a book mixed with some detective flair?
[01:06:52] <Nanobot> Outbreak Company is closer to Gate than SAO.

[01:08:20] <DPA> I don't understand this concept of "cool"
[01:08:25] <Nanobot> DPA: Death Note is a pretty smart series. It's about two intelligent characters trying to outwit each other, and the things they're able to do are grounded in rules.
[01:08:55] <Nanobot> Fewer than 37 episodes, IMO. I stopped watching at the... logical end.
[01:09:23] <Berlin36> DPA "enjoyable"
[01:09:29] <DPA> Ok, I'll give it a try too, later.
[01:09:32] <Nanobot> The authors continued the story beyond the original intended ending, because the publisher wanted them to. But there's a certain point where the main story ends and it moves on to what is basically a sequel.
[01:12:10] <Nanobot> They made another series called Bakuman, which was sort of a dramatized autobiography of them getting into the industry. In it, the characters start making a series that's essentially Death Note, and they're faced with the decision of whether to end it where they wanted to artistically, or continue it because the publisher wanted to. In real life, they continued it. But in Bakuman, they decided to end it early and said they would regret it otherwise.
[01:13:02] <Nanobot> I took that to mean that they regretted adding that last arc in Death Note.
[01:13:15] <Nanobot> Because of that, I've never watched that part.

[01:20:41] <Cryowolf> steins;gate is arguably a type of isekai

[01:24:40] <emmeka> Ascendance of a Bookworm is all about that
[01:25:08] <Cryowolf> well they kind of begin to do what in Log Horizon
[01:25:15] <Cryowolf> but then run into problems
[01:25:55] <emmeka> also I mean, does Dr Stone count
[01:26:22] <Nanobot> Dr. Stone isn't technically an isekai, but it does kinda work like one.
[01:26:59] <emmeka> it's still set on earth but for all intents and purposes the characters are sent to another world, just by the mechanism of time rather than space
[01:27:31] <Nanobot> I forget about Dr. Stone, because it has the feel of a shounen battle anime, but they're battling WITH SCIENCE

[01:32:17] <Cryowolf> kind of. Not need as in I can't start up games but more like. I can't play them decently on good fps unless I  set everything to the lowest and sometimes 'hack' the ini and cfg files to lower it even more
[01:32:33] <Bco1981_2> i was reffering to the balls
[01:32:34] <Cryowolf> to the point where it might look like 2010 g raphics
[01:32:43] <Cryowolf> so was I
[01:33:00] <Bco1981_2> how do you start games with your balls ?
[01:33:52] <Cryowolf>   every moment of ejaculation produces more energy in the balls than a lightning strike. I've harnessed this energy, stored it up in batteries
[01:35:14] <Cryowolf>  now as for the 3060 ti. With that I could set things to high graphical settings and run them at high fps with 1440p
[01:35:20] <Cryowolf>  Joy  joy

[05:59:08] <amigojapan> Roey: I remember travelling to veracruz a lot, my grandparents had a home in san miguel de allende and manzanillo colima, and I alos went a lot to chiapas where my mom was from
[05:59:22] <Roey> cool

[05:59:42] <amigojapan> Roey: you ask about bad parts
[05:59:49] <Roey> well they weren't always this bad I mean
[06:00:31] <amigojapan> roey the dessert is not the best parts of mmeixco
[06:01:25] <Roey> hrm.
[06:01:25] <Roey> ok
[06:01:32] <Roey> well what about mexico city
[06:01:33] <Roey> ?
[06:01:52] <amigojapan> roey thats where I was born and grew up
[06:01:59] <amigojapan> and it is nto dessert
[06:02:32] <Roey> yeah it's not dessert that's why I asked
[06:02:46] <Roey> oh cool so you're from that city originally
[06:02:54] <amigojapan> roey the parts around mexico city are forest
[06:02:58] <Roey> ya
[06:03:11] <Roey> did you see winters at all when you were growing up there?
[06:03:19] <Roey> or is it much more tropical?
[06:03:19] <amigojapan> roey and in chiapas there is jungle
[06:03:22] <Roey> a
[06:03:26] <Roey> aye

[06:04:14] <Roey> ahhhh ok
[06:04:19] <Roey> so why do I ask,
[06:04:20] <amigojapan> roey mexico city is over 2000 meters high
[06:04:31] <Roey> because I think of it in terms of growing 
[06:04:37] <Roey> I remember going to Costa Rica,
[06:04:43] <Roey> and the weather there is always tropical,
[06:04:51] <Roey> so they have fruit trees blooming year-round
[06:05:01] <Roey> and like you can just keep your tomato plant outside all the time
[06:05:04] <amigojapan> not all mexico is tropical
[06:05:07] <Roey> right
[06:05:15] <Roey> well like you say in the higher-altitude areas it's cooler

[08:17:16] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: but the bottle says "do not operate heavy machinery
[08:17:54] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: that usually means that it can cause side effects that can hamper your ability to react suddenly
[08:18:50] <KatrinValerie> Here in Germany you would not be able to legaly drive with your medication either.
[08:18:55] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: maybe but I don't feel it and I can drive a bycicle 
[08:19:18] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: You can still drive a bycicle rather safely when completely wasted
[08:19:33] <amigojapan> I see
[08:20:16] <KatrinValerie> Albert Hofmann once rode his bike all the way back home from his lab, whilst accidentally tripping on LSD.
[08:20:35] <amigojapan> Accidentally?
[08:20:37] <KatrinValerie> Okay enough of the drug history
[08:20:55] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: he absorbed some through his skin, despite precautions
[08:21:15] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: it is very potent and not very much is required for a strong effect
[08:21:38] <KatrinValerie> And to make sure it was not a fluke, he repeated the experiment and ingested some on purpose
[08:22:31] <KatrinValerie> Anyways, depending on the exact medication, here in Germany you can get a legal exempt if you have a proper medical attestation to your driving abilities.
[08:22:42] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: is that a law..
[08:22:54] <ButterNoodle> if its a sign.. thats merely a suggestion
[08:23:17] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: it basically voids any insurance claims in case of a crash
[08:23:27] <KatrinValerie> Not a good position to be in
[08:23:44] <KatrinValerie> And with certain drugs, getting pulled over and tested can already get you in trouble
[08:23:55] <ButterNoodle> yea not a thing in the us
[08:24:02] <KatrinValerie> You need a special permit for some of these drugs, for others it is not possible
[08:24:04] <ButterNoodle> unless they are narcs
[08:24:06] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: they investigate it in Japan before giving a driver's license
[08:25:25] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: for some drugs you need a driving test, for some a doctors note is enough
[08:25:37] <KatrinValerie> or in my case, not having any seizures within 1 year
[08:25:57] <KatrinValerie> I think I cracked the 1year mark by now
[08:26:50] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: fortunately public transportation is good here
[08:27:24] <KatrinValerie> Oh, I forgot to go to sleep

[08:32:50] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: me driving should be against the law
[08:33:14] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I am usre I could drive in the US, nobody owudl investigate it
[08:33:44] <ButterNoodle> if u have a medical marijuana card, u cant own guns in the US.. but they dont go door to door checking
[08:34:08] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: you can't buy one in a store
[08:34:22] <KatrinValerie> there are ways to buy one anyways
[08:34:32] <KatrinValerie> so at least the purchase is not illegal
[08:34:35] <hi117> tfw you're trying to send a mail to the mailing list but can't because it turns out you also found a security vulnerability and can't send that email to the public mailing list without disclosing the security vulnerability
[08:34:38] <ButterNoodle> just as I'm sure if u already had a license in japan or germany, they arent gonna come take it if u get on a medication that means u cant drive or whatever
[08:34:59] <ButterNoodle> yes
[08:35:02] <KatrinValerie> ButterNoodle: I watch LegalEagle on YouTube, the dude is an US lawyer and he talks about law stuff
[08:35:02] <hi117> so you have to wait on the security team to respond before asking your actual question about bugs
[08:35:08] <ButterNoodle> having laws doesnt mean u cant
[08:35:19] <KatrinValerie> WOuld recommend if you like to learn cool stuff about law

[11:02:01] <Sadale> MootPoot, The prostate massager I've got isn't exactly a buttplug. But I do find it much easier to reach orgasm while I'm wearing it.
[11:02:11] <Sadale> Not a nice thing to have if I want to edge
[11:02:13] <MootPoot> Maybe it's so he dosent accidentally fart during sex
[11:02:20] <Sadale> LOL

[11:03:27] <MootPoot> It uses a gyroscope

[11:03:38] <ButterNoodle> Sadale: wtf.. what about my manhood has to do with my ass hole? do they put the dicks on babies backwards in your country?
[11:03:39] <MootPoot> And opens a vent when you're pulled out 
[11:03:54] <MootPoot> So you can use the power of your farts while thrusting 
[11:03:57] * ButterNoodle can see that being a problem
[11:04:25] <ButterNoodle> imagine having to lift up ur cock and balls to take a shit :|
[11:04:39] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, haha that's a joke. I'm sorry if that offend you. Just so you know I do have some fun with my ass as well. And I'm a sub. That'd make my manhood even more questionable than yours.  xD

[12:16:44] <Nanobot> What anime series was it where a character would say "I'm sorry" (I think it was "sumimasen") whenever someone helped him/her, and then another character told them to stop saying "I'm sorry" and start saying "thank you"?
[12:17:34] <ButterNoodle> SAO
[12:17:51] <ButterNoodle> or was that a serious question
[12:18:03] <Nanobot> Serious question. I'm trying to remember.
[12:18:13] <ButterNoodle> ...
[12:18:29] <ButterNoodle> I remember that from at least 3 different anime
[12:18:33] <ButterNoodle> one movie..
[12:18:39] <Nanobot> I thought it might have been Kimi ni Todoke, but I just rewatched the first couple episodes and she says "thank you" a lot.

[14:06:19] <amigojapan> !c carbon tax
[14:06:20] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: A carbon tax is a tax levied on the carbon emissions required to produce goods and services. Carbon taxes are intended to make visible the "hidden" social costs of carbon emissions, which are otherwise felt only in indirect ways like more severe weather events.
[14:06:32] <MootPoot> that does not explain in detail enough
[14:06:39] <MootPoot> about how the pricing works
[14:07:15] <amigojapan> Who pays it to whom?
[14:07:57] <MootPoot> basically - you tax how energy intensive things are based on how much carbon they output so being wasteful is more expensive.- then that money is used to subsidize stuff like solar panels and hydro etc, or its given back in the form of tax credits
[14:08:20] <MootPoot> so its financially worth it to spend money to use less energy
[14:08:58] <amigojapan> MootPoot: mine would be cheap, I don't own a car
[14:09:32] <Bco1981> MootPoot: that's extremly logical... that won't work
[14:09:47] <MootPoot> amigojapan: so in short your daily living gets more expensive, but since you dont consume a lot then other peoples carbon taxes will come to you in the form of tax rebates and subsidies
[14:09:49] <Bco1981> is what the politicians would say

[16:40:34] <JesseDesu> DunceCotus is in a parallel universe where the earth is flat and moon landings are proven to be fake, but his IRC connection is somehow able to interface with our universe's IRC protocol
[16:41:02] <amigojapan> Lol Jesse
[16:41:21] <JesseDesu> you cant rule out this possibility
[16:42:15] <amigojapan> Jesse but American TV programs don't help. There are TV programs I saw in America saying that the moon landing was fake. Some people probably believe them
[16:42:41] <DunceCotus> its not about the tv programs
[16:42:53] <amigojapan> I guess it is considered freedom of speech
[16:42:54] <JesseDesu> DunceCotus, do you think this is true
[16:43:03] <DunceCotus> its about weird inconsistencies in quality of NASA footage, shots of massive moon models NASA built for 'reasons'

[16:46:20] <Bco1981_2> i found it amoung my pics i hade downloaded. thought it would be funny to set ip up with that on a Arch install.
[16:46:31] <Zoidberg> how was the experience so far Bco1981_2? have you configured everything?
[16:46:51] <JesseDesu> master race has an etymology of eugenics and racism
[16:46:59] <amigojapan> Bco1981: modern consoles are basically PCs
[16:47:00] <Bco1981_2> Zoidberg, i have network, sound and nvidia drivers. works extremely smooth.
[16:47:09] <amigojapan> Bco1981: cheap gamming PCs
[16:47:23] <Bco1981_2> amigojapan, yeah, just the OS is very closed.
[16:47:29] <emmeka> JesseDesu "PC master race" is an old thing people who PC game instead of console game used to say as a sign of their own superiority. Which, always seemed like poor branding to me. "like yes, the thing we would like to use as an allegory of our supremacy, is literally white supremacy. This could not possibly go wrong"
[16:47:31] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: yes, I dont like it
[16:48:10] <Bco1981_2> Zoidberg, the worst part was onboard sound chip seems to not be supported anymore. so had to put in a pci sound card.

[16:48:59] <Bco1981_2> amigojapan, this arch install ?
[16:49:05] <emmeka> N64, hardware wise, was the worst console of its generation. Great library, though.
[16:49:06] <amigojapan> yes Bco1981_2

[16:51:45] <JesseDesu> i'm thinking the barometer is overkill
[16:51:59] <emmeka> lastonestanding yeah I was gonna say, wasn't the Saturn more powerful hardware wise
[16:52:13] <emmeka> and the N64 had a competitive CPU, but wasn't great at everything else
[16:52:20] <Bco1981_2> Zoidberg, it loaded fine, it detected fine, i could ajdust levels mute/unmute, everything... i could see that audio was playing... just no sound. and loading a manjaro-live sound worked.
[16:52:28] <lastonestanding> emmeka: but the power could not be used!!
[16:52:39] <emmeka> it's true.
[16:52:49] <emmeka> people think the same thing about the gamecube

[16:54:37] <emmeka> it's clear the N64 hardware had limitations, not in the least due to the cartridge format.

[16:56:18] <Bco1981_2> Zoidberg, well after 2 days... actually more becaus it did the same thing when i had debian on this pc. after 2 days of testing, i gave up on the onboard. the pci card is also way better.
[16:56:24] <lastonestanding> what made the xbox great was directx and network, or?

[17:11:34] <amigojapan> I guess darkwitch, I am no shintoist tho
[17:11:41] <emmeka> I think it's basically garaunteed to break things that you'll then have to fix
[17:11:49] <Bco1981_2> ^
[17:11:50] <emmeka> which, isn't impossible, but is tedious
[17:11:57] <Bco1981_2> that's why i don't update windows

[17:12:41] <MootPoot> tbh at this point

[17:12:50] <amigojapan> darkwitch: not in debian
[17:12:54] <MootPoot> in this hobby/field of work
[17:13:03] <MootPoot> you can't really get around it
[17:13:17] <darkwitch> you need to add a penalty for breaking stuff
[17:13:17] <JesseDesu> break not brake
[17:13:18] <MootPoot> without some level of impariment
[17:13:20] <emmeka> I like Fedora's model, which is essentially the exact opposite of rolling release. They do very frequent (about 1 every 6 months) releases which require a full version update, but doing so is also trivial.
[17:13:20] <isekaijin> Zoidberg: I don't think Debian tells you what to install, though. You can install non-free software just fine.
[17:13:20] <Bco1981_2> amigojapan, in debian, you are just left with. you can't install fancy new stuff
[17:13:24] <amigojapan> darkwitch: debian does not add anythign until it is solidly tested liek 20 years
[17:13:37] <amigojapan> Bco1981_2: except you can
[17:13:46] <amigojapan> Bco1981_2: you just need to do it manually
[17:13:57] <darkwitch> follow the russian ideal. 15 years in prison if you break stuff
[17:14:02] <emmeka> so any breaking typically occurs over the course of, or is prevented by, the version upgrade
[17:14:08] <isekaijin> amigojapan: “solidly tested like 20 years” -- yeah, at which point something else is new and shiny
[17:14:10] <amigojapan> Bco1981_2:you dont need everything to be bleeding edge
[17:14:12] <Bco1981_2> then you need to update libraries, and then things start to break
[17:14:15] <isekaijin> amigojapan: That's what's so frustrating about Debian.
[17:14:26] <MootPoot> I've broken debian more times then I've broken arch
[17:14:28] <MootPoot> somehow
[17:14:34] <MootPoot> btw I use arch
[17:14:44] <Bco1981_2> you need to compile updated libraries and the dependencies of premade packages start to break.

[17:16:00] <JesseDesu> it's*
[17:16:19] <mixfix41> its a programmers model. look at haskell and caball install gets you the application.
[17:16:23] <emmeka> if there's one thing I'm grateful to Arch for, it's the existence of the Arch wiki
[17:16:31] * mixfix41 does a standing ovation
[17:16:32] <isekaijin> amigojapan: Back then, I was heavily into C++ and Haskell, both of which require you to have reasonably up-to-date compilers and libraries to do useful stuff. So having to install GCC and GHC separately really pissed me off.
[17:16:32] <emmeka> which is generally useful to any linux user of any distro
[17:16:34] <MootPoot> emmeka: the arch wiki is weird
[17:16:49] <JesseDesu> i mean, compilers will know if you fuck up the language, why dont we do the same with spoken languages
[17:16:51] <MootPoot> its well written, but its also completely blind to its faults
[17:17:04] * MootPoot points at the nvidia driver setup page
[17:17:05] <isekaijin> The alternative was installing unstable packages on a stable system, but I tried it once and managed to fuck up my system.
[17:17:08] <emmeka> what faults. it's written for Arch users.
[17:17:12] <amigojapan> isekaijin: taht does nto piss me off, stuff brakign all the tiem pisses me off

[17:17:56] <isekaijin> MootPoot: I'm a perma-newbie to Arch, and I can read the Arch wiki just fine. You don't have to learn / understand absolutely everything.
[17:17:57] <MootPoot> but it has the problem where it assumes you know already kind of know what you're doing 
[17:18:05] <MootPoot> which is not really the case
[17:18:08] <Bco1981_2> yes
[17:18:10] <emmeka> MootPoot the problem with that sentence is that an Arch user should in no way be a noob, you should install Arch if you *know what you're doing* when you install it.
[17:18:19] <MootPoot> isekaijin: yeah, but you're also an experienced linux user
[17:18:21] <MootPoot> emmeka: fair
[17:18:23] <MootPoot> I guess

[17:18:29] <emmeka> or, learn by trial by fire
[17:18:35] <JesseDesu> you dont want to use it for a production machine
[17:18:37] <Bco1981_2> MootPoot, you are right about that, if i didn't have a vidoe, and a different guide. i would not have made it work.
[17:18:39] <MootPoot> can't really argue when arch isen't presented as a distro for all
[17:18:40] <isekaijin> MootPoot: Still, probably best to first try it on a virtual machine.
[17:18:46] <emmeka> and grind your way through Arch installs until you level up and become a wizard, as Bco1981_2 did

[17:19:41] <mixfix41> brick is one who doesnt it expect it
[17:19:41] <MootPoot> its angles like this where I wish arch could maybe learn a little from how M$ does its docs or how mozilla developer network does its stuff
[17:19:46] <isekaijin> amigojapan: What emmeka just said.
[17:19:47] <amigojapan> yes isekaijin, its not so old as debian, and is not as unstable as arch
[17:19:49] <isekaijin> Oh.
[17:20:04] <isekaijin> Well, yeah, then that works.
[17:20:11] <amigojapan> emmeka: not in those vectors, thta is not what I meant
[17:20:11] <MootPoot> both of them have a way of showing you the noob stuff when you want noob handholding - AND shotgunning you in the face with pure info if you look for it
[17:20:15] <MootPoot> arch is mostly the latter
[17:20:17] <isekaijin> But what annoys me about Linux Mint is that the default installation installs too much crap that I don't need.
[17:20:36] <isekaijin> Debian and Arch are better at only installing what you need.
[17:20:37] <emmeka> MootPoot it doesn't need to. There are other distros to take that approach. Arch isn't intended for anyone except those wizards among us who can make the terminal bend to their will with ease
[17:20:40] <mixfix41> if you use arch you also utilize the storage space
[17:20:43] <amigojapan> isekaijin: yeah, that is true
[17:21:00] <MootPoot> emmeka:  I know it dosen't need to - but I wish it did is all I'm saying
[17:21:22] <isekaijin> I don't want to buy the mightest and greatest computers just so that my system isn't horribly slow, like ButterNoodle or MootPoot.
[17:22:10] <emmeka> isekaijin Mint and really all the Debian spinoffs feel bloat-y to me
[17:22:31] <MootPoot> isekaijin: that's fine too...but you also complain that literally anything you dont want is bloat that must be obliterated, you are pretty far on the opposite side
[17:22:32] <Bco1981_2> isekaijin, you don't have to. this old pc runs windows 7 - 11 perfectly fine
[17:22:49] <Bco1981_2> the only downside to this pc, is the 8gb ram limit
[17:22:55] *** Joins: Iolo (~iolo@user/Iolo)
[17:22:57] <MootPoot> I can get your reasoning, but even for linux I'd point out a PC over 10 years old is a shitbox
[17:23:05] <Bco1981_2> heY!
[17:23:23] <Bco1981_2> sure compiling takes some time... but
[17:23:34] <emmeka> you shut your mouth, my little girl works hard every day
[17:23:36] <Bco1981_2> i could use this as my daily pc
[17:23:39] <MootPoot> lol
[17:23:45] <amigojapan> isekaijin: emmeka arch basically always brakes the ld saying of "if it aint broke dont fix it"
[17:23:50] <MootPoot> emmeka: what are you using anyways
[17:24:10] <MootPoot> I remember you asking about getting a new computer some time ago
[17:24:27] <emmeka> MootPoot an ancient ass Acer prebuilt desktop with an AMD Kaveri APU
[17:24:28] <isekaijin> amigojapan: I don't find that it ever breaks, really. But I keep my system simple enough that, if it breaks, I can fix it myself without too much googling.
[17:24:44] <MootPoot> isekaijin: but also - I dont really have the mightiest computer...I'm several notches below that
[17:24:48] <amigojapan> alright isekaijin
[17:25:06] <MootPoot> not like I'm running a 32 core threadripper and a 3090 TI
[17:25:06] <Bco1981_2> emmeka, can you find the model number?
[17:25:12] <MootPoot> emmeka: oh god
[17:25:14] <amigojapan> isekaijin: I should nto really complain abuut arch, I am really complaining about manjaro
[17:25:17] <isekaijin> It breaks if you try to do complicated setups, because of course you're going to get some setup steps wrong.
[17:25:19] <isekaijin> Oh.
[17:25:20] <MootPoot> emmeka: I used to run one of those
[17:25:24] <isekaijin> I haven't used Manjaro, though.
[17:25:31] <MootPoot> even chromium on linux brought it to its knees
[17:25:41] <MootPoot> ONE tab
[17:25:46] <Bco1981_2> compiling, not using...
[17:25:49] <emmeka> mmm it's not that bad.
[17:25:53] <amigojapan> isekaijin:manjaro is kind of like imitationg mint but using arch papckages
[17:26:02] <emmeka> I put new RAM in it, a long while ago
[17:26:22] <emmeka> I can generally abuse tabs and it's k, in fact it does everything fine, it just can't game.
[17:26:23] <MootPoot> mine was a amd quad core APU model from....2011 or something?
[17:26:30] <MootPoot> the bulldozer APUs
[17:26:35] <MootPoot> with 24gb of ddr3
[17:26:37] <mixfix41> as long as the distro doesnt do complaints because of corporate interest its still great. thats how applications turn sour. and if they get rid of the archive its done
[17:26:48] <MootPoot> and an ssd I put in after the fact
[17:27:02] <MootPoot> 100% of my issues with that system started and finished with the cpui
[17:27:17] <MootPoot> pretty sure my wifi router has a faster cpu then that thing now
[17:27:44] <MootPoot> It died on me a while back so I stripped it of parts and chucked it
[17:27:52] <MootPoot> now I have 24gb of ddr3 with nothing to put it in
[17:28:42] <emmeka> Bco1981_2 says it's an Acer Aspire ATC-220-EB52.
[17:29:16] <MootPoot> emmeka: I commend you for keeping that thing running
[17:29:21] <MootPoot> mine borked 5 years in
[17:29:41] <emmeka> it runs just fine, I have no issues with it. if anything, I got lucky... those AMD apus work pretty flawlessly with linux without issue
[17:30:27] <MootPoot> right now my shittiest computer thats still in running condition runs a i7 7700HQ
[17:30:48] <MootPoot> basically useless for anything more then youtube and some light dev work
[17:31:01] <Bco1981_2> emmeka, so a A10-7800, maybe
[17:31:12] <emmeka> Bco1981_2 yes, that's the APU
[17:31:41] <MootPoot> wow
[17:31:57] <MootPoot> seems like even the new ryzen APU systems still cant outclass a gtx 1050...
[17:32:04] <MootPoot> amd fix ur shit
[17:32:17] <emmeka> huh? yes they can.
[17:32:35] <MootPoot> I just looked at a quick side by side on YT, only one game but
[17:32:38] <emmeka> 5700G is spiffy.

[17:43:27] <MootPoot> and also the gpu shortage
[17:43:41] <MootPoot> no point making a game that shows its best on gpus that people cant even buy
[17:43:50] <MootPoot> you have to sell it after all

[21:06:17] <ImoutoBot> [image/png] 2.6MB
[21:06:44] <isekaijin> There is no “Open location” option.
[21:06:45] <Bco1981_2> ah it's a app, then it's not a shhortcut
[21:07:16] <isekaijin> The app itself can't possibly be in the Start menu folder, right?
[21:07:28] <isekaijin> It has to be somewhere in C:\Program Files or C:\Windows.
[21:08:06] <Bco1981_2> most likely in c:\windows\*somewhere*
[21:08:58] <isekaijin> Gah.
[21:09:34] <isekaijin> My drawing tablet supports remapping its buttons to different keys depending on the program I'm currently using.
[21:09:37] <Bco1981> like, my Edge is in C:\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-microsoftedge_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.18362.418_none_67333209819e3a81
[21:10:06] <isekaijin> So I want to map some keys to common drawing commands like undo, redo, scroll up/down, etc., but only when I'm using the whiteboard.
[21:10:18] <Bco1981> the file is MicrosoftEdge.exe
[21:10:30] <isekaijin> wtf is that vomit of a directory name
[21:10:35] <isekaijin> Even worse than NixOS.
[21:10:48] <Bco1981> so maybe go to the c:\, ans search for *whiteboard*
[21:10:54] <Bco1981> and*
[21:11:00] <Bco1981> that's how i found edge
[21:12:33] <HeTo> I don't think you can just start a Universal Windows exe, or if you do, it won't work correctly. there is setup that needs to be done to make the environment suitable for UWP. you would have to go through the proper means, like starting it through its start menu entry
[21:12:47] <isekaijin> Bco1981: Well, the Microsoft PowerPoint executable is called “powerpnt.exe”. If you look for a file whose name contains the substring “PowerPoint”, you aren't going to find anything.
[21:13:28] <HeTo> there's probably some powershell commands that let you query information about UWP apps though, like their location
[21:13:33] <Bco1981_2> well, i did say maybe.
[21:14:11] <Bco1981_2> i just think that *white* will be impossible to go through.
[21:15:53] <isekaijin> It's amazing. I'm pretty sure I also didn't have trouble finding programs in Windows XP, so it's not like Microsoft absolutely *can't* make an OS where finding programs is easy.
[21:16:19] <isekaijin> They're actively trying to make it difficult. It's the only reasonable explanation.
[21:16:24] <HeTo> you could try Get-AppPackage | ? { $_.Name -like '*whiteboard*' }
[21:16:42] <isekaijin> Let's see.
[21:16:44] <isekaijin> Thanks, btw.
[21:16:47] <isekaijin> To both.
[21:17:01] <HeTo> but it's not like the location will help you much. as I said, it probably won't work correctly if you just launch the exe without setting up the proper environment
[21:17:41] <isekaijin> I don't need to launch the executable. I need to tell my drawing tablet to remap the buttons when I'm using the Microsoft Whiteboard.
[21:18:28] <isekaijin> This wouldn't be an issue on Linux, because I have a specific mapping of programs to virtual desktops, and it's trivial to query which virtual desktop I'm currently using.
[21:19:08] <HeTo> oh. I wonder if the remapping program can query the exe of universal Windows apps like that
[21:20:41] <isekaijin> Oh, so I wouldn't be able to use different key mappings for different UWP apps?
[21:20:44] <isekaijin> Great!
[21:21:07] <HeTo> well, the task manager knows the exe so there is hope
[21:22:27] <HeTo> in task manager, you can right-click on the app when it's running and select go to details or if that's disabled, expand the app and then right-click one of the suboptions of the app and choose go to details. from there, you can check the details of the selected process or right-click it etc.
[21:24:52] <isekaijin> Right clicking on individual apps in the Task Manager doesn't open any context menu.
[21:24:58] <isekaijin> Which I'm sure it did in Windows XP.
[21:25:22] <HeTo> have you clicked it open into the more details mode?
[21:25:33] <isekaijin> Yeah.
[21:25:40] <HeTo> hm, I get a context menu even in the less details mode
[21:26:18] <isekaijin> Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm using a pen.
[21:26:54] <isekaijin> Once again, by simply treating my pen as a mouse, without any further cleverness, Linux does better than Windows.
[21:27:03] <isekaijin> (Well, Xorg or whatever.)

[21:46:48] <ButterNoodle> I finally got it to work.. it use to be ez
[21:46:50] <Bco1981> nah, it wouldn't make any changes
[21:47:26] <ButterNoodle> u gotta set SigLevel = Never
[21:47:32] <Bco1981> so i put in a audigy2 and continued on.

[21:47:58] <ButterNoodle> that makes 2 of us to use a 2nd sound card
[21:48:36] <ButterNoodle> my reasons are the new 11th gen gets terrible noise on analog, the spdif randomly goes white noise at full volume...
[21:48:52] <Bco1981> ehh what ?
[21:49:01] <ButterNoodle> instead of a 200$ mobo.. I should have bought the 400$ one for better sound?
[21:49:03] <ButterNoodle> yea
[21:49:06] <Bco1981> spdif isn't analog ?
[21:49:19] <ButterNoodle> ik its a shit onboard sound
[21:49:23] <ButterNoodle> spdif is fiber no?

[21:50:14] <ButterNoodle> *on analog I get noise..
[21:50:37] <ButterNoodle> switched to spdif for optical isolation - and get digital as a coincidence
[21:50:54] <Bco1981> that is one of my criteria when i buy a mobo, onboard sound can't some half ass'ed codec.

[22:47:51] <Bco1981_2> he said the ssd might be broken because he couldn't get into windows, and if it did, it wouldn't last long... so he dropped it off here. after a week i finally turn it on, sure it seemed like it had some start up issues, but, a few reboots and it has been working flawlessly since.
