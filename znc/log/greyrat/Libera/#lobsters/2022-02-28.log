[09:29:56] <mockturtle> [ DebianInstaller/Preseed/EditIso - Debian Wiki ] - wiki.debian.org
[09:30:59] <kline> bparker, you probably want to look at buildroot / yocto if you are interested in creating custom distros though
[09:31:37] <bparker> yea that's just generating the iso file itself from an already finished build product
[09:31:49] <bparker> I want to start further back than that
[09:31:55] <kline> then scroll up the page
[09:32:39] <bparker> doesn't appear to be helpful
[09:33:10] <bparker> "One of the already built ISO images is required"
[09:33:18] <kline> bparker, it talks about unpacking an iso, adjusting it, adding a pre-seed (custom debian configuation) etc
[09:33:32] <bparker> yes but I want to start from scratch just like LFS
[09:33:46] <bparker> inb4 'then use LFS'
[09:34:12] <kline> most distros are a bit like compilers in that they are a bit past that and they bootstrap new isos off of existing environments
[09:34:25] <kline> if you really want that, then i would point you back at buildroot again
[09:34:55] <bparker> that existing environment still must be build somehow every so often though, right?
[09:34:58] <kline> (which builds a kernel and root filesystem and can package it into install media)
[09:35:00] <bparker> I want to start there basically
[09:36:17] <kline> debian isos are basically frozen testing instances with an installer walkthrough to feed in the correct per-instance customisations (or use a preseed, as linked to)
[09:36:31] <kline> arch and gentoo do walk you through the creation of a filesystem from scratch if you want

[12:50:01] <kline> think thats probably a bit extreme but ok
[12:50:15] <kline> i guess the question is "whats the cost of a new tag", and its basically 0
[12:51:03] <kline> given the upshot, that being that the site is significantly more hospitable for many people, it seems like a cost:benefit analysis would be to just add a tag for clearance hazards
[12:51:52] <river> better solution is not to be hospitable to these people
[12:52:00] <kline> is it?
[12:52:27] <kline> its worth remembering that pretty much none of the people in question are going to comment, its mostly people who have second-hand offence
[12:52:45] <kline> people with clearance worried about the hazard that causes are not going to be self-identifying them on a publicly readable site

[12:54:38] <gthm> what did I miss?
[12:54:48] <kline> but i will say that unless some kind of proactive step (add tag, ban classified material, or tell people with clearances they are just not allowed), there gap is always going to be filled by people with second hand offence

[12:57:30] <river> i was responding to this
[12:57:36] <earthy> gerikson: that all really very much depends on the clearance levels surrounding the computers
[12:58:11] <earthy> plus, there's special dedicated hard- and software to make multiple clearance levels on a single kvm
[12:58:26] <gerikson> huh til
[12:58:30] <river> earthy: ooh that sounds intersting
[12:58:36] <kline> gerikson, theyre not
[12:58:49] <kline> classified computers arent on the clearnet by definition
[12:58:53] <gthm> gonna file that one under "not my problem"
[12:59:09] <kline> you get so called "red" and "black" lines
[12:59:28] <earthy> or 'rooms', even, depending. :)
[12:59:45] <river> gthm++
[12:59:49] <kline> but in the US they have a very weird policy where if classified material enters the public domain and you are exposed to it in any context, you have to do an aftercare process
[13:00:28] <albertito> ah! but it sounds like a very us-centric stuff, right? and who decides/knows/etc what is and what isn't classified; what happen about other countries processes (if they even have such a thing?)
[13:00:48] <albertito> river: thanks for the background!
[13:00:49] <kline> so if you were, say, a weapons researcher with clearance, and you stumbled across a snowden document on your morning read, you have to stop what youre doing and call the clearance agency and they will tell you what to do and what implication it has on your own clearance

[17:35:30] <rwb> 10 negate / 3 == -4
[17:35:34] <rwb> hmmmm that doesn't seem quite right
[17:36:09] <rwb> wait actually python agrees wut
[17:36:21] <rwb> i guess // is "divide and explicitly floor"
[17:40:41] <gwozniak> river: yes, there is embedded C++ out there, and expect there to be more
[17:41:16] <river> but what are the best practices with regard to memory allocation?
[17:41:43] <river> is it really so bad that you wouldn't even temporarily allocate a string just to copy it into a stack allocated buffer
[17:41:54] *** Quits: zacque (~zacque@1.32.81.194) (Quit: Goodbye :D)
[17:41:55] <river> or is that heading into superstition
[17:43:41] <iDrougge> rwb: ÷
[17:44:15] <rwb> unfortunately my lexer is currently allergic to ascii
[17:44:17] <iDrougge> But I don't see the point in having different operators for the same thing. It's bad when you have the same operator for different things, like * in C.
[17:44:19] <rwb> non-ascii i mean
[17:44:32] <gwozniak> river: it depends.  Generally malloc() is a bad idea in embedded systems
[17:44:43] <rwb> iDrougge: not the same thing, integer division != float division
[17:44:52] <ngoldbaum> river: C++ has a number of language features outside the standard library that differentiate it from C
[17:44:53] <iDrougge> Oh, I see what you mean.
[17:45:10] <river> when you say malloc, do you include new/delete
[17:45:15] <iDrougge> REXX uses % for integer divison.
[17:45:17] <ngoldbaum> also you don’t have to abandon the *entire* standard library, just a lot of it
[17:45:25] <gwozniak> But stack allocation is okay, assuming you can control for the size
[17:45:58] <gwozniak> And string formatting code is huge, so pulling in that library code can be a problem
[17:46:06] <rwb> iDrougge: i already reserved that for modulo :^(
[17:46:13] <kline> pushcx, big bants, thanks
[17:46:42] <iDrougge> / is modulo.
[17:46:52] <iDrougge> I mean //, bloody IRC.
[17:47:02] <kline> //
[17:47:10] <rwb> haha, i see
[17:47:24] <rwb> i think i'll do 1 floatDiv: 2 for now :^))))))))
[17:48:05] <iDrougge> Question is whether MOD is necessary as a standard operator of its own? If we discarded every case where people use it to devise if a number is even, usage would be rather specialised.
[17:48:22] <kline> mod is definitely useful
[17:48:30] <rwb> oh btw, gonna post this soon, but zigself gained a REPL as of last night and as of about an hour ago no longer shits the bed when you don't add whitespace at the end :^)
[17:48:31] <kline> even today i saw it used for calculating a checksum
[17:48:52] <rwb> REPL implemented in pure self code
[17:49:02] <rwb> (minus the primitives)
[17:49:07] <kline> other useful things include time/circle related calculations
[17:49:25] <kline> and breaking down large things into fixed sized, smaller components
[17:50:12] <iDrougge> kline: I agree that modulus is useful, but so is exponentitation.
[17:50:33] <iDrougge> And square root.
[17:50:33] <river> gwozniak: ahh yes I did not even think about code size
[17:50:35] <river> that's a great point
[17:51:07] <gwozniak> ``It is identical to snprintf() except that it reads the format string from the Flash memory,''
[17:51:27] <gwozniak> Wait... string constants aren't in Flash on Arduino?
[17:51:42] <gwozniak> That's... weird
[17:53:42] <gwozniak> river: at work we changed the printf functions to not pull in code for format specifiers that aren't used
[17:54:00] <gwozniak> %f and friends being the worst offenders for code size
[17:54:41] <gwozniak> Makes for a helluva mess, but it prevents some big functions from being pulled in
