[00:53:46] <sfdebug> hi, anyone know how to close the client connection and make the php page continues processing other things?
[01:00:12] *** Joins: jetchisel (~jetchisel@user/jetchisel)
[01:06:57] <AllenJB> sfdebug: Assuming you mean the connection to the browser (via the web server), I don't believe there's a way to do that from the PHP side. Depending on what you're doing you might want to look at pushing the additional work to a queue that's processed by a cron or long-running consumer process
[01:08:57] <judah> oh, yeah, thats totally possible. Lemme do a quick google
[01:09:21] <__adrian> lots of things are possible  ;)
[01:09:27] <__adrian> +1 for the job queue
[01:10:02] <sfdebug> judabuda, already did it, no solution worked for me yet
[01:10:23] <judah> https://maslosoft.com/kb/how-to-continue-script-execution-in-background-in-php/
[01:10:54] <judah> Something like that maybe? I had a case where I had to do it once a long time ago and it worked flawlessly, but I no longer have access to that code
[01:11:30] <__adrian> that's not exactly what they asked - that's telling php not to die when the browser closes the connection, not php telling the connection to close.
[01:11:39] <__adrian> but even if it were,  job queue
[01:12:11] <judah> yes, job queue is the way to go for sure
[01:12:26] <sfdebug> no, i'm telling exactly it. close the connection with client and continues processing
[01:12:59] <sfdebug> the problem is this function "fastcgi_finish_request()"... didn't come enabled on my php compilation
[01:13:26] <AllenJB> Even if you found a way to do it, if you're using mod_php or php-fpm you'd still be taking up a worker process that can't serve further web requests until it's finished.
[01:14:31] <sfdebug> well. i will throw a background .php CLI

[01:19:55] <Sammitch> sfdebug: we know what you want to do, but the thing is that those things have been proven to be a bad idea for a variety of reasons. using a job queue is the best option.
[01:19:59] <__adrian> you could if you wanted to ...but realize that's not what we're suggesting
[01:20:55] <Sammitch> the way you're going to go you're going to wind up with either zombie processes that never die and eventually tip over your server, or something triggers WAY more background processes than your server can handle, which tips over the server.
[01:21:44] *** Joins: Helenah (~s98259@user/helenah)
[01:21:50] <Sammitch> using a job queue and a process manager wrangling a set number of workers will prevent both of those and allow you to actually control your background processes
[01:22:17] <sfdebug> anyway, that's a simple solution to a simple problem. this page haven't to be a error proof at all
[01:22:50] <Helenah> My gf will heredoc everything to create a functional website yet every other developer I've seen the code off put <?php ?> tags where ever they need to execute PHP code. Why do they do that? And is there anything wrong with my gf's practice?
[01:23:22] <__adrian> Helenah: !+php first
[01:23:23] <php-bot> Helenah, your PHP code can be sorted into two categories: code which _performs work_ (processing input, controller logic, database access, error handling, etc.), and code which  _produces output_ (header(), echo, <?= $var ?>, plain ol' <html>, etc.). work goes FIRST. output goes LAST. https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/9ed2542a695e2ebe30aa
[01:23:48] <__adrian> it's not whether you have raw html output vs. echoing it all (but, don't echo it all).
[01:24:03] <__adrian> it's about work vs. output.
[01:25:03] <__adrian> for example,  <p><?= $helloworld ?></p>  is fine. but  <p><?php process_form_submission(); ?></p>  not so much.

[01:33:01] <hans> why is a dt greater than or equal to another dt which is 10 days later?

[01:34:57] <hans> yeah that works, hmmm. don't see why that works and the first one doesn't tho
[01:35:07] <__adrian> do you see hwat i changed?
[01:35:46] <hans> (clone())->modify()   vs (clone()->modify)
[01:36:07] <noord> hans: it is LISP issue,
[01:36:07] <__adrian> yes. do you understand what the (parenthesis) do here?
[01:36:12] <noord> lots of silly parans
[01:36:23] <__adrian> it's got nothing to do with lisp
[01:36:43] <__adrian> just like in basic math, parens can be used for grouping / order of operations
[01:37:02] <__adrian> hans: your original code was modifying the $dt _first_, and _then_ cloning it.
[01:37:05] <noord> __adrian: just paranthesis joke
[01:37:58] <__adrian> hans: also useful:  https://php.net/datetimeimmutable
[01:38:02] <hans> guess not. i don't see how this could mean "modify it first then clone it": if($d1 >= (clone($d1)->modify("+10 days")))
[01:38:14] <hans> if i wanted to modify it first, i would say clone($d1->modify())
[01:38:30] <__adrian> ($dt) and $dt  are the same expression
[01:38:54] <__adrian> there's only on value in there to evaluate. it's a non-op.
[01:39:02] <__adrian> (((((($dt)))))) is also the same thing

[01:39:49] <__adrian> clone ($d1)->modify()  is therefore the same as  clone $d1->modify()
[01:40:08] <__adrian> but   (clone $d1)->modify()  means the cloning happens first
[01:40:44] <hans> huh, i see. some weird order of evaluation for the clone() statement then. cus if i do function stupidClone($v){return clone($v);}if($d1 >= (stupidClone($d1)->modify("+10 days"))){}  then it goes in the order i expected
[01:41:05] <__adrian> it's not "wierd." you just didn't know about it
[01:41:16] <hans> thanks, i get it now
[01:41:19] <__adrian> again, DateTimeImmutable  https://3v4l.org/7FQPl#v8.1rc3
[01:41:22] <__adrian> np
[01:41:45] <hans> the reason im doing the clone() thing at all is because a co-worker doesn't use DateTimeImmutable, but yeah i'm aware ^^
[01:43:20] <hans> "as a rule of thumb, always use DateTimeImmutable over DateTime"
[01:44:33] <Blondie101010> well show him if it's applicable
[01:44:53] <Blondie101010> that seems to be exactly the use case for DateTimeImmutable
[01:45:27] <hans> anyway g2g take a shower, cya
[01:46:03] <__adrian> use DateTimeImmutable as DateTime, DateTime as MutableDateTime;  // sorted
[01:47:09] <Blondie101010> that could have been a wiser choice, but it's too late to change that
[01:47:19] <Blondie101010> no don't redefine them :)
[01:47:40] <hans> and if you really need a function to modify your datetime, it works fine with & https://3v4l.org/ReErl
[01:48:09] <Blondie101010> no!!!
[01:48:16] <Blondie101010> that's not better at all
[01:51:04] <hans> imo, line <=9 is better than line >=10 here, even tho they achieve the same thing, https://3v4l.org/V6OPP

Simple... if you loadbalance and one server has an issue with it's write to the file system you are lost, with a storage backend you can check if you can connect, nosql server or msql, redis, whatever you can manage it in your application

[19:06:36] <Blondie101010> yeah, so you have to either change your expectations or the timeout
[19:06:38] <znf> trying to get a fpm-status is proving harder than I was expecting it
[19:07:08] <Naktibalda> so you have 5000 children serving streams, right? do you expect to get no http requests?

[19:10:00] <Blondie101010> but so far nothing you showed looks like a problem
[19:10:16] <Blondie101010> is there anything malfunctioning?
[19:10:19] <znf> well, it's *sort* of a problem: 15:40:08 up 25 days,  3:47,  1 user,  load average: 479.17, 488.58, 488.75
[19:10:28] <Blondie101010> how many cores?
[19:10:46] <Blondie101010> idle process don't increase the load
[19:10:48] <znf> 104 threads, so 52 cores
[19:10:55] <Blondie101010> so your server seems to be maxed up
[19:10:58] <Blondie101010> yeah overloaded
[19:11:14] <Blondie101010> you need to find what overloading it
[19:11:28] <Blondie101010> maybe it can't be improved without a hardware upgrade
[19:12:18] <znf> that's what I'm trying to do, my upload is around ~18-19Gbit (on a 25Gbit port), the CPU is not in waing or sys (so no irq issues far as I can tell)
[19:12:19] <Blondie101010> but that conclusion would depend on a proper profiling of the server resources and programs
[19:12:26] <znf> waiting*
[19:12:38] <Blondie101010> the load says it all
[19:13:00] <Blondie101010> your fpm worker stats don't matter at all at this point
[19:13:09] <Blondie101010> what is your bottleneck?
[19:13:11] <znf> it's confusing because I've had ~7000 people online without issues last weeked on the same server
[19:13:37] <znf> that's what I'm not able to figure out - I know the load points to a bottleneck somewhere, but all the stuff I'm looking at looks fine

[19:17:10] <znf> https://pastie.dev/hpIgLp.angelscript
[19:17:58] <Blondie101010> keep watching it but I suspect your network send limit is close to 2100MB/sec
[19:18:33] <Blondie101010> you'd likely need another server with a completely separate network
[19:18:39] <znf> 2100 * 8 = 16800 Mbit/s, on a 25Gbit port
[19:18:44] <znf> shouldn't really be an issue tough
[19:18:54] <Blondie101010> there are MANY factors in play
[19:19:03] <Blondie101010> number of packets sent is a big one
[19:19:58] <znf> I'm peaking at about 3mil PPS, if I'm reading this stats right
[19:20:00] <znf> let me double check
[19:20:05] <Blondie101010> but your machine is really overloaded, and unless you change what you send on the network, you absolutely need an upgrade

[19:23:55] <Blondie101010> is the video encoding or resolution in any way different?
[19:24:22] <Blondie101010> perhaps it could even be related to the contents if using a compressed encoding
[19:24:49] <Blondie101010> things that change rapidly will cause more and larger packets to be sent
[19:25:11] <znf> for comparission, another server that is basically a mirror of this (same streams, same user count): https://pastie.dev/3MOeUU.yaml
[19:25:48] <Blondie101010> look at their differences for the tiny differences
[19:26:00] <Blondie101010> that dstat output is quite similar
[19:26:18] <Blondie101010> that one is slightly leess overloaded
[19:27:19] <Blondie101010> just noticed the second one receives less data on the network
[19:27:36] <Blondie101010> that might hint you on the load difference
[19:30:34] <znf> it does vary, but at the same time, the server that is being more chill also pushes out more -- https://i.imgur.com/UXsMBxs.png
[19:34:43] <Blondie101010> yeah a bit more, but what's the difference in ingress?
[19:35:26] <znf> I'll have to check manually the streams my guys set, altough they should be mirrored

[22:09:46] <__adrian> they're not correct. this channel is for php code questions.
[22:10:07] *** Quits: Nekomander (~BadAdvice@user/badadvicecat) (Remote host closed the connection)
[22:10:16] <__adrian> why wouldn't you use Word (or similar) for writing documents?
[22:10:27] <__adrian> plain text editors aren't intended for that
[22:10:32] <da_wunder> ^

[22:10:46] <tester12> da_wunder I couldnt update beacause of my Local history(VCS) that hasnt migrating to new vesrsion and I will lost all history data, its important for me
[22:11:14] <da_wunder> I would just use Markdown - PhpStorm supports that nicely
[22:11:49] <da_wunder> tester12: so just push those to vcs and then upgrade your phpstorm...
[22:12:13] <tester12> Blondie101010 How R U blondie?=D  those people was one of your freinds I think, theyre not bad
[22:12:30] <Blondie101010> frankly don't know or care
[22:12:52] <biberu> __adrian: but TeX
[22:14:34] <tester12> I want use an editor that write or set needed tags automatically in my texts and doesnt need to write all p and breaklines manually.'=D '=D '=D
[22:15:05] <tester12> so thanks all

[22:17:24] <tester12> Blondie101010 Do not be tired and be successful. But do not be too dry and grumpy, my good friend
[22:17:36] <tester12> X-P =D =D =D
[22:18:51] <__adrian> tester12: do you mean you want to write _html_ but like you would a word document? this is called a WYSIWYG editor. they're complete junk. but if you want one, i'm sure you could find one.
[22:18:54] <tester12> and also other freinds here=D
[22:20:27] <da_wunder> tester12: or are you looking for something like - https://phpstorm.tips/tips/22-emmet/ ?
[22:21:19] <tester12> when I need to write some text in my php Apps or website, I have to write all breaklines and <p> tags or strong and other else, I want use one simple richtext editor that do this automatically like Dreamweaver But If it was in phpstorm is better
[22:21:37] <tester12> __adrian
[22:21:46] <__adrian> yeah, you want a WYSIWYG
[22:21:54] <tester12> maybe
[22:22:09] <__adrian> i'm sure you could find one. but they do not produce good results.
[22:22:16] <tester12> but it need to set with myself in a html page
[22:23:00] <__adrian> html is not about what your content looks like. that's why a "what you see" editor isn't suitable for creating html.
[22:23:15] <tester12> yes
[22:23:20] <tester12> thanks again
[22:23:28] <__adrian> html is about what your content _means_. e.g., this is a heading, this is a paragraph, this is empahsized
[22:23:58] <__adrian> not "this is big text, this has space above and below, this is italic."

[23:14:39] <relipse> I'm not seeing where i need a private and public key, why not just one special token they are to keep private?
[23:14:49] <relipse> for an api
[23:16:17] <Blondie101010> those are two different things
[23:16:22] <Blondie101010> what are you trying to do?
[23:16:37] <stenno> the public key allows that others can encrypt messages for you that only you can decrypt
[23:16:49] <relipse> I'm trying to allow 3rdparty or 1st party apps use my web tool api
[23:17:19] <relipse> instead of using the mobile-friendly website so they can make an app using their own gui componentst
[23:17:33] <__adrian> why did you decide to use keys (why not a simple token)?
[23:17:42] <relipse> yeah i did decide on a token
[23:17:44] <Blondie101010> nothing in that tells me why you want a toke or keys
[23:17:47] <Blondie101010> *token
[23:17:47] <relipse> but isn't that kind of dangeorus
[23:17:56] <__adrian> what?
[23:17:57] <relipse> once someone gets the token they have full acces sot the user's account
[23:18:18] <__adrian> yes, that's why you tell people to keep their keys secret
[23:18:23] <relipse> that's it?
[23:18:26] <Blondie101010> hmmm definitely shouldn't
[23:18:28] <relipse> there is no better way?
[23:18:41] <__adrian> but also no, you don't have to provide "full access."
[23:18:52] <__adrian> but again, why did you choose keys?
[23:19:00] <relipse> what do you mean by keys
[23:19:06] <relipse>  i didn't offically choose anything
[23:19:12] <__adrian> what do _you_ mean by keys? you said it.
[23:19:13] <relipse> i'm still developing
[23:19:32] <Blondie101010> you're developping before knowing what you're doing?
[23:19:47] <__adrian> plan first. write code later.
[23:19:53] <Blondie101010> so you want to authenticate API requests
[23:20:19] <Blondie101010> how you do it mostly depends on what has to be protected
[23:21:13] <Blondie101010> bank or other transaction systems have stronger requirements, for example
[23:22:06] <__adrian> authentication = "this is who i am"
[23:22:15] <__adrian> authorization = "this is what i'm allowed to do"
[23:23:08] <__adrian> so proving who you are doesn't _have to_ (and in many cases, shouldn't) determine everything you're allowed to do.
[23:24:57] <Blondie101010> relipse:  your token idea is basically like a password
[23:25:12] <relipse> yeah that's what I realized
[23:25:20] <relipse> it seems too insecure
[23:25:32] <Blondie101010> be sure to pass it encrypted and give it strong minimum lenght requirements
[23:25:35] <relipse> why not jus thave them enter their username and password for each request?
[23:25:48] <Blondie101010> that's not an API
[23:25:53] <relipse> it can be
[23:25:59] <Blondie101010> no
[23:26:06] <relipse> i realize most apis don't use username and password for authentication but it's possible
[23:26:17] <Blondie101010> you mean to pass it, sure
[23:26:26] <Blondie101010> but the API does not ask questions
[23:27:26] <Blondie101010> we still don't have a clue what your API does
[23:28:06] <Blondie101010> I sure wouldn't enter my password 1000 times per hour like my API clients do
[23:28:49] <Blondie101010> of course it could be saved and used in the request, but then what does it change if you call it a token, password, or randomJunk?
[23:29:49] <Blondie101010> note these comments are mostly considering you have direct clients
[23:30:13] <Blondie101010> if you need to handle third party relations, then there are more serious things to consider
[23:30:28] <relipse> ok thank you for your thoughts, i will think about that thanks
[23:40:40] <relipse> do you recommend upgrading from 5.6 to 7.4 first or just go from 5.6 to 8.1 ?
[23:42:47] *** Joins: jamesmartinez (uid6451@id-6451.helmsley.irccloud.com)
[23:42:59] <__adrian> try it
[23:43:40] <__adrian> if you can make it work with 7, it'll very likely be fine on 8.
[23:43:59] <__adrian> are you using anything that's been removed? ext/mysql, mcrypt, etc.?
[23:44:49] <biberu> bump the php version in your environment setup scripts, run your test suite, and find out ;)

[23:45:20] <da_wunder> super easy to do with docker environment
[23:48:41] <relipse> i'm not a docker-by
[23:48:43] <relipse> boy
[23:48:47] <relipse> i'm a wsl guy
[23:48:56] <__adrian> use wsl then
[23:49:25] <relipse> yep could upgrade locally and do testing
[23:49:27] <biberu> wsl and docker aren't mutually exclusive
[23:49:52] <biberu> you'll often run docker via wsl on windows
[23:51:28] <biberu> but no matter what tools you're using, if you script your environment it's easy to prepare for and test migrations, and obviously you want to have automated tests go verify that things work
[23:52:21] <relipse> haha automated tests
[23:52:35] <relipse> what with seleniuM?
[23:52:55] <__adrian> maybe? but probable were thinking of phpunit
[23:53:23] <biberu> primarily unit tests, but sure, other types too
[23:53:50] <biberu> fwiw containers can help with integration tests, selenium etc. too
[23:56:22] <biberu> you can create new databases in known states for each test run if you want, or perhaps start the entire site while automating browser tests in another containers
[23:57:50] <biberu> relipse: you might have been able to migrate and test in less time than it took to ask the question ;)
