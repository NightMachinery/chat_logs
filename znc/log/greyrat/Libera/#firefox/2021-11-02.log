[00:03:16] <BaronVladimirHar> The Web started out pretty small and reasonably usable. Most sites were independently operated. It loaded in a reasonable amount of time, even on a dial up modem that could only pull in several KB per second.
[00:03:42] <BaronVladimirHar> When Apple hijacked KHTML and KJS, they "complimented" how clean and readable the code was.
[00:04:12] <BaronVladimirHar> They specifically mentioned how it implemented mostly complete Web standards support for the time in under 150,000 lines of code.
[00:04:34] <BaronVladimirHar> And now Webkit is a hulking monstrosity with tens of millions of lines of code.

[00:05:29] <BaronVladimirHar> Google has a tendency to pretend what they do is open source, but then they get to decide where the whole thing ends up.
[00:05:58] <BaronVladimirHar> And at this point, it's funny because Vivaldi has lists of features, and a lot of it recently is "Google implemented this so that they can spy on you, and we turned it off.".
[00:06:47] <BaronVladimirHar> It will take more work at some point I'm sure, than simply compiling Chromium and then starting it up with a bunch of flags.
[00:07:28] <BaronVladimirHar> I built Firefox a few times. I'm sure I wouldn't know where to start now with all of this rust nonsense floating around.
[00:07:54] <BaronVladimirHar> With the last round of layoffs, they got rid of the Rust people and moved Rust to a foundation that Microsoft pretty much controls.

[01:16:47] <nemo> back when people didn't think much about these things online
[01:17:24] <caveman> who was defining http/js/etc pre w3c?
[01:17:41] <nemo> it was kinda ad-hoc.
[01:17:48] <nemo> people just tossed things in
[01:17:51] <caveman> microsoft.
[01:17:54] <nemo> I mean JS was invented by netscape
[01:17:56] <nemo> which became mozilla
[01:18:03] <nemo> personally I think best bet is to just disable JS by default
[01:18:06] <caveman> mozilla firefox?
[01:18:07] <nemo> NoScript/uMatrix
[01:18:16] <nemo> well initially mozilla suite. then later firefox
[01:18:17] <nemo> much later
[01:18:26] <nemo> but
[01:18:31] <caveman> didn't know that js is mozilla's sin.  
[01:18:35] <nemo> I'm not sure when that spec was added. it's been a long time anyway
[01:18:36] <nemo> heh
[01:18:44] <nemo> caveman: yeeeep. was created by one dude in a week or two
[01:19:14] <caveman> then nsa loved it and made it an integral feature of every site.
[01:19:14] <nemo> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Creation_at_Netscape
[01:19:42] <nemo> the web is just such a handy framework for remote app delivery
[01:19:48] <nemo> it's hard for me to blame any conspiracy in particular
[01:19:56] <nemo> it has a lot of abusable pieces and everyone is kind of at fault
[01:20:02] <nemo> just restricting JS will help a lot though
[01:20:16] <nemo> I'd say these days google is leading the charge with evil/stupid ofc.

[01:20:54] <nemo> anyway. given the time constraints, Brendan came up with an impressive tool

[01:21:09] <caveman> mozilla's sin was probably by pure dumbness.
[01:21:37] <nemo> but again, it's not hard to disable/whitelist. so. eh. just do that. it's surprising how much of the web works without JS
[01:21:40] <nemo> and a lot faster too
[01:21:49] <nemo> sometimes there are alternatives as well
[01:22:04] <nemo> https://lib.rs/  for example. oddly enough is faster than the official site

[18:02:31] <switchnode> i have an old xpi extension that modified the browser to open urls from external applications in a user-designated 'main' window (rather than a new window or the most recently active window).
[18:02:42] <switchnode> having looked over the webextensions api as documented in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API, it seems to me that there's no way to duplicate this: webNavigation.onBeforeNavigate _almost_ gives me the functionality that i want, but it doesn't have any way to tell what prompted the navigation event or whether it was external.
[18:02:46] <switchnode> am i indeed out of luck, or have i missed something?

[22:23:04] <cvmn> like who?
[22:23:40] <cvmn> ok, alternatively, firefox should be designed to allow the ui to be easy to replace.

[22:35:14] <mefistofeles> that would require such a huge and costly effort
[22:35:52] <mefistofeles> I mean, not even chrome is aiming for that, so far
[22:36:20] <cvmn> chrome is demon's browser.  means nothing to us.

[22:46:45] <cvmn> nemo: vimperator/pentadactyl is ok.  just a clean ui like qutebrowser
[22:47:10] <nemo> oh. you don't care for the UI redesigns
[22:47:15] <nemo> eh. I honestly don't care that much
[22:47:25] <nemo> some people seem enormously concerned about things like tab appearance
[22:47:30] <cvmn> did you see qutebrowser?
[22:47:33] <nemo> yes
[22:47:42] <cvmn> its ui is minimalist.  that's how it should be.
[22:48:03] <nemo> you can style firefox to be more minimalist if you really want to
[22:48:13] <nemo> doesn't even require a custom build
[22:48:27] <nemo> userChrome.css is still an option and there's plenty of reference projects already
[22:48:32] <cvmn> can yu remapt ctrl+N?
[22:48:43] <nemo> yes... but requires modifying an XML config file
[22:48:45] <nemo> I used to script that
[22:48:50] <nemo> but don't bother anymore
[22:48:54] <nemo> the one that I scripted was CTRL-W
[22:48:59] <nemo> since it messed with my w3m sessions

[22:49:09] <cvmn> ctrl+n and ctrl+p should be for tab shuffling
[22:49:43] <nemo> *shrug*
[22:49:48] <nemo> everyone has their habits I guess
[22:51:13] <cvmn> only 1 habit is true for a pair of 5-fingered hands.

[23:04:07] <nemo> cvmn: I am perfectly comfortable, at least on my keyboards, with ctrl-shift-pageup/down
[23:04:17] <nemo> I hold down ctrl-shift with left hand and tap page up/down with right
[23:04:23] <nemo> they are easy to find without even looking
[23:04:30] <nemo> just due to their position next to each other
[23:04:45] <nemo> but ctrl-w *was* messing with me, just due to w3m 😝
[23:04:56] <nemo> and I tend to have like 20+ tabs open in w3m
[23:06:01] <cvmn> which operating system do you use?  and which text editor?
[23:09:00] <nemo> linux. vim
[23:09:40] <mefistofeles> tbf, not even vim is relevant these days
[23:09:58] <mefistofeles> most users just need to know the basics and that's it
[23:09:59] <cvmn> nemo: odd.  then how did you grow accustomed to such immoral shortcuts?
[23:10:17] <mefistofeles> so, making a browser behave like an "obsolete" text editor is just silly, imho
[23:10:57] <mefistofeles> cvmn: have you consider that consistent shortcuts around ALL applications might not be that relevant?
[23:11:01] <mefistofeles> *considered
[23:11:44] <cvmn> that only means that we have a bigger job to purify shortcuts.
[23:11:58] <mefistofeles> yet nobody cares
[23:12:19] <nemo> mefistofeles: I have to disagree about obsolete but I also don't see the need to make everything function like vimp
[23:12:22] <nemo> *vim
[23:12:36] <nemo> https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1
[23:12:54] <nemo> for one thing, composability is not something I find enormously useful in the browser
[23:12:59] <mefistofeles> nemo: hence the quotes, but it's obsolete in terms of "market share" if you want to use that metric
[23:13:02] <nemo> ah
[23:13:04] <nemo> fair 'nuff
[23:13:07] <nemo> ditto linux ofc
[23:14:37] <mefistofeles> nemo: true
[23:16:38] <nemo> hm... they've really reorganised things
[23:16:45] <nemo> $ grep keycode chrome/browser/content/browser/browser.xhtml <key id="key_delete" keycode="VK_DELETE" command="cmd_delete" reserved="false"/> <key keycode="VK_BACK" command="cmd_handleBackspace" reserved="false"/>
[23:16:54] <nemo> browser.xhtml has a bunch of the binds
[23:16:59] <nemo> but the others are defined elsewhere
[23:17:02] <nemo> there used to be a master list

[23:46:47] <nemo> Kaedenn: a lot of custom themeing went away with quantum, but thankfully userChrome.css still works
[23:46:56] <nemo> Kaedenn: so if you're into doing personal customisation that'd be the place to go
[23:47:12] <nemo> there's various projects out there with custom userChrome.css templates already
[23:47:37] <nemo> toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets;true
[23:48:12] <Kaedenn> Okay, set that to true
[23:48:17] <nemo> https://www.userchrome.org/
[23:48:29] <Kaedenn> Do I modify userChrome.css directly or can I make an extension that applies a small change?
[23:49:07] <Kaedenn> oooh I see
[23:49:11] <Kaedenn> interesting
[23:49:14] <nemo> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Toolbox  you might also want this
[23:49:27] <nemo> which should simplify identifying the existing CSS
[23:49:44] <nemo> Kaedenn: note that this is all unofficial and you might have to update if they change their HTML/CSS
[23:50:11] <nemo> Kaedenn: but yeah, it's basically just an override stylesheet
[23:50:17] <Kaedenn> alright
[23:51:08] <nemo> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1584542 and this bug looks to be what might needed if we're ever to be able to update our hotkeys again.
[23:51:17] <nemo> the new system is a convoluted mess compared to the old browser xul
