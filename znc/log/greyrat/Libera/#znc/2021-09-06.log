[00:00:53] <DoctorD90> hello! :D MetaNova did you find out the time to review the pages? :)
[00:01:11] <MetaNova> beyond what I already have? no
[00:01:48] <MetaNova> not yet, anyway
[00:02:26] <DoctorD90> ok! great! :)
[00:02:45] <DoctorD90> when you will end, I will publish and edit other modules pages :)

[00:31:14] <brachamh> hey i'm looking to set up logsearch. i have znc set up as a system service, so the path is /var/lib/znc. there currently is no modules directory, but i can create that and install logsearch into that, right?
[00:34:01] <brachamh> also, once i load a mod once with "/znc LoadMod modpython" it will load again on restarts?
[00:42:49] <brachamh> so i got logsearch to load...apparently i didn't have any logging set, so i'll have to wait a bit before i really try to use it. i would just like confirmation that loaded mods start with znc when it restarts. (thinking of linux system services which you can load but also have to enable)

[00:45:18] <DarthGandalf> or if you use webadmin
[00:45:37] <brachamh> ah thank you
[00:45:59] <Khaytsus> Yeah, what DarthGandalf said.... you probably made changes but they didn't get saved.  Never have understood why znc is so lazy about saving config.
[00:46:10] <brachamh> i just saved config, so i'll be good
[00:46:45] <brachamh> then the one thing i'm not understanding with logsearch...how do i call it?

[00:57:53] <MetaNova> oh, I wrote that not long ago

[00:58:58] <MetaNova> (/msg *logsearch help)
[00:59:02] <brachamh> i found those...had to figure out how to get to where it would accept the commands. apparently /msg *loadmod help
[00:59:03] <brachamh> lol
[00:59:23] <brachamh> er, logsearch, not loadmod
[00:59:33] <brachamh> not sure where that came from
[01:01:06] <brachamh> hmm...logs aren't logging anything anyone else says
[01:01:06] <Khaytsus> Yes, that's how you talk to any module..  query *modulename

[01:01:17] <brachamh> i hadn't used modules yet, really
[01:01:34] <Khaytsus> Look on the filesytem, see if it is logging or not..  if not, fix that, if so, fix your paths in the logsearch module
[01:11:03] <brachamh> hmm...i can't find the log locations. i enabled logs from webadmin and left the box blank, so logs should be in default location, right?
[01:12:52] <MetaNova> brachamh: at which level did you load the log module? global, for the user, or for the network?
[01:13:03] <MetaNova> because, each one has a different location
[01:14:20] <brachamh> oooo...network level i think, that might help, hang on
[01:16:48] <brachamh> ok found it
[01:20:15] <brachamh> ok i got it now...i was missing the period in "#znc .*" in the logsearch query
[01:21:54] <MetaNova> while I wrote the wiki page on logsearch, I have not used it myself
[01:22:14] <MetaNova> I can't confirm if the exampled "#chan *" is invalid and "#chan .*" is required
[01:22:20] <MetaNova> I'll actually load it and test later
