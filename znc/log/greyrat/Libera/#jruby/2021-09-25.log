[00:42:45] <meckispaghetti[m> <headius> "Probably warbler still but not..." <- One more thing. If I wanted to also include a Java runtime environment into the executable (letâ€™s say .exe for Windows), do I have to use Java Packager or does warbler do this, too?
[00:55:55] <enebo[m]> meckispaghetti: you will need some more generic installer.  We use install4j for our JRuby windows installer but looking for install4j competitors should get you a list of various others.
[00:56:48] <enebo[m]> Also I should say we actually stopped shipping an exe with a pre-bundled jvm because keeping a non-CVE JVM up to date is just another point where you have to re-release
[00:58:05] <meckispaghetti[m> Good point! Thanks for mentioning this, I'll keep this in mind.

[09:28:01] <byteit101[m]> Was working on getting JRubyFX ready for release, but then I realized that I have some classloader bugs. Is there a classloader for all reified objects? I can get one for each class I reify (the one-shot), but then I can only load one class from java code.
[09:39:10] <byteit101[m]> side question: is it just me, or is the gem-version of irb not compatible with 9.3?

[16:31:35] <headius> There are some issues with it still
[16:31:50] <headius> It requires a high degree of control over the terminal
