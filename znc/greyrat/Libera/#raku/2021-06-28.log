[01:56:13] <SmokeMachine> Hi! sorry for insisting on this, but I really think `.reduce()` should be able to receive the aggregator as parameter... that would make it easier to fix something like this:
[01:56:17] <SmokeMachine> m: :{{"a" => 1} => {:10a}, {"b" => 2} => {:20b}, {"c"=>3}=>{:30c}}.reduce: -> |c ($_, %b) { say c; :{|%b, .value => .key} }

[05:20:41] <tbrowder> yo, does anyone have a practical use for raku routine 'round'?
[05:21:46] <tbrowder> if i were king, i would change it to round a number to x decimal places.
[05:22:42] <tbrowder> perl POSIX round also seems not very useful
[05:29:37] <japhb> tbrowder: I use it every so often.  I like the way it works, actually, because I often need to have routines that work in either base-1000 or base-1024/
[05:30:28] <japhb> Or want to graph something and round to the step size of exactly one row on the screen.
[05:30:45] <tbrowder> the posix round, or raku round?
[05:30:50] <japhb> Raku
[05:31:48] <japhb> Essentially, I often want to round to multiples of an arbitrary Rat, for which it works well.
[05:32:05] <tbrowder> hm, can you show an example? i don't grok the ones in the docs
[05:32:40] *** xinming_ is now known as xinming
[05:35:38] <japhb> tbrowder: First couple routines in https://github.com/japhb/Terminal-QuickCharts/blob/master/lib/Terminal/QuickCharts/Pieces.pm6 would be one
[05:51:52] <tbrowder> i think i get it, but it seems like the routine should be called 'scale' instead of 'round', just saying...
[05:56:44] <tbrowder> when creating charts i'm used to 'scaling' all values by a factor based on the largest value, not rounding them.
[06:02:01] <tbrowder> hm, i see the difference in yr use, and i'll have to play with it a bit. and study docs some more
[06:02:17] <tbrowder> japhb: thanks for the help

[19:20:37] <oodani> hi! i'm trying to set up rakudo on a macos 11.4 system right now. installing rakudo with `brew install rakudo` works and gives me the compiler itself, but i don't have a line editor, and running `zef install Readline` as recommended led me to realise i don't have the zef command at all. what's the recommended way to add zef to a homebrew-managed rakudo? is it supposed to be included in the rakudo homebrew formula? i noticed that the precompiled builds at
[19:20:38] <oodani>  https://rakudo.org/downloads *do* include zef, which suggests the homebrew formula probably should too
[19:21:34] <El_Che> oodani: git is probably the easiest way in the short term
[19:25:27] <oodani> aha, gave the commands at the top of https://github.com/ugexe/zef a shot. it looks like it installed into /usr/local/share/perl6/site/bin, which isn't already on my path, but that's easy enough to fix for now c:
[19:27:12] <oodani> aaand now i have a line editor! yay!
[19:27:37] <oodani> cool, thank you c: in the long run the homebrew formula probably should include zef? but this workaround is cool for the time being

[19:58:24] <El_Che> that sounds bad
[19:59:02] <El_Che> alias reval="rlwrap raku"
[19:59:03] <El_Che> maybe
[20:00:53] <tonyo> oodani: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/rakudo.rb <- this is the brew file for rakudo
[20:00:59] <tonyo> did you install rakudo-star or rakudo ?
[20:02:25] <tonyo> rakudo-star contains zef, rakudo is the bare bones
[20:03:30] <El_Che> 9/10 is rakudo star not what I want. What's needed is maybe a brew formula for zef
[20:04:55] <El_Che> I don't use macos enough to have the energy to create that
[20:05:53] <rassoc> "that sounds bad" -- how so? no problems so far

[20:06:18] <El_Che> most of the rime raku is not an interactive program
[20:06:37] <El_Che> you don't want to use rlwrap in non interactive programs
[20:07:17] <rassoc> as said, no problems so far, even with non-interactive programs
[20:07:31] <tonyo> i never want rakudo star either but i always manually install zef too
[20:08:03] <El_Che> rassoc: my suggestion is use another alias for the rlwrapper raku
[20:08:08] <El_Che> like rakue
[20:08:13] <El_Che> for raku eval
[20:09:22] <rassoc> example of what might not work?

[20:10:08] <El_Che> raku foo.raku
[20:10:17] <El_Che> (old habbits :) )
[20:10:50] <rassoc> i say it again: no problem so far. that works just fine
[20:11:36] <El_Che> ok, just keep it in your mind if you have a problem :)

[20:14:15] <tbrowder> tonyo: is fez reliable enough now to replace cpan?
[20:16:04] <tonyo> i think so, the only bug reports i have outstanding are related to (specifically) openBSD tar and it's not a blocker just an annoyance.
[20:16:22] <tonyo> i'd say yes.  i can get some stats on downloaded modules (one sec)

[22:04:06] <tbrowder> tonyo: one confusion, will the auth id be  ":auth<zef:name>" or ":auth<fez:name>"?
[22:04:41] <tonyo> zef:name
[22:05:01] <tbrowder> and is the "name" case insensitive like cpan?
[22:06:35] <tonyo> it is not
[22:07:55] <tonyo> i'll add a -q flag to meta so you can retrieve your meta info from fez. fez doesn't actually manage your META json for your pkg, the meta info fez has is only available to raku land so you can have profile info like on cpan
[22:08:21] <tonyo> if you change your email address in fez, it doesn't muck around with your uploaded modules to change their METAs
[22:09:01] <tonyo> tbrowder: what does this question mean? `What are the valid author-defining keys?`
[22:13:02] <tbrowder> not very good wording for sure, but mainly stuff about how fez account data are used and applied as you've been telling me about. the auth requirements (zef:case-sensitive), etc.
[22:15:13] <tbrowder> so we have to manually ensure the META6 auth data are correct for zef? even though it's not changed by fez.
[22:15:24] <tonyo> gotcha
[22:16:12] <tonyo> fez has a command `checkbuild` that you can run that should make you reasonably sure your meta is OK for both zef and fez uploading
[22:17:15] <tbrowder> i hope skaji releases his fez-compatible soon. japhb has been looking for him--hope he is okay
[22:17:55] <tbrowder> .seen skaji
[22:17:56] <tellable6> tbrowder, I saw skaji 2021-04-17T12:47:58Z in #raku: <skaji_> lizmat: Thanks. I'm not in a hurry. It can wait.
[22:21:10] <tbrowder> ok, the checkbuild i assumed was look only, but i'm ocd sometimes. oh, well, i'm ready to take the plunge
[22:25:21] <tbrowder> i see a possible problem when using checkbuild.
[22:25:42] <japhb> oh?
[22:26:23] <tbrowder> using a module created with mi6 fez reported the zef missing on auth
[22:27:15] <tbrowder> i changed to zef in both Meta and the rakumod file
[22:27:44] <japhb> That's kinda odd, if you've changed it in both places
[22:28:20] <tbrowder> ok, next checkbuild fez reported name mismatch (upper case vs lower case registered)
[22:29:13] <tbrowder> i changed to lower case in Meta but left upper case in rakumod but zef didn't complain.
[22:29:20] <japhb> tbrowder: Oh, I remembered something that may be useful to you, I dunno.  My releaser script for MUGS: https://github.com/Raku-MUGS/MUGS-Core/blob/main/lib/MUGS/App/Releaser.rakumod
[22:29:42] <japhb> Ah, gotcha
[22:30:36] <tbrowder> so fez doesn't use auth data in the module name?
[22:31:03] <tbrowder> how about version info?
[22:32:00] <tbrowder> tonyo: that was my concern--what data are definitive when we now have three ecosystems?

[22:33:14] <japhb> You log in with fez.  (That's also true of CPAN, except that lots of people have their CPAN auth in a file.)
[22:33:28] <tbrowder> for raku, not counting japhb's others
[22:33:39] <japhb> My others?
[22:34:50] <tbrowder> at a quick glance yr prog handles multiple ecosystems, i assumed there were others
[22:35:07] *** Joins: reportable6 (rep-able@2001:41d0:2:5eb5::)
[22:35:08] <japhb> But generally speaking, for great justice, fez login should equal META auth (with a leading zef: prepended) should equal rakumod auth (exact match for META auth)
[22:35:59] <tbrowder> yes, but checkbuild doesn't see that yet
[22:36:03] <japhb> tbrowder: Ah.  Really it's mostly to save me some work until fez-compatible mi6 is out
[22:36:31] <japhb> tbrowder: PR time?  :-)
[22:37:38] <tbrowder> i'm not smart enough for fez or mi6 PRs--there be dragons
[22:38:48] <tbrowder> let me try an mi6 check with my auth changes...

[23:07:43] <tonyo> fez uses the auth data in the META for the full module name, it doesn't use what you put in `fez meta`.  fez does verify that the META and your username match when you upload, eg if you force upload a module with auth zef:XYZ and you're using zef:tbrowder's key then fez won't index.  when you run `fez checkbuild` it should tell you whether the meta matches, when you run `fez upload` it'll run a checkbuild 
[23:07:49] <tonyo> _against_ the created tar.gz.  if you're using git and your git supports `archive` then you may end up with whatever is in the META committed to the repo and not what you see when you `cat META`.  
[23:09:14] <tonyo> fez is the only eco that forces your username and `auth:` in your meta to match.  on cpan i can uploading anything and spoof your auth info to make it look like you made the module.
