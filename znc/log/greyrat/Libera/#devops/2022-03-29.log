[22:32:12] <slaughter> I think I hate CDK
[22:32:25] <slaughter> I haven't even written a single line of it yet and I'm already pretty sure I hate it
[22:39:41] <lantech19446> what is cdk?
[22:40:32] <slaughter> Real answer: AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) is a programmatic abstraction over Cloudformation. Define your IaC as literal code
[22:41:07] <slaughter> My answer: a shitty hot mess with horrible paradigms that causes more work and way more reasoning than is necessary
[22:41:34] <lantech19446> oi
[22:41:45] <lantech19446> sounds like something i'm glad not to be fucking with
[22:41:59] <slaughter> It definitely is. Stick with Terraform, it won't do you wrong
[22:42:27] <lantech19446> I haven't even gotten that far yet
[22:42:44] <slaughter> The general consensus on CDK amongst infra people is the same as my opinion, fwiw. Devs love it, but devs love anything that even slightly abstracts infra no matter the cost
[22:43:23] <slaughter> It's for sure better than naked Cloudformation, but that's just because Cloudformation sucks to begin with. 
[22:44:14] <slaughter> It's also written in TypeScript, and any language variation of it (python, go, whatever else they have) just transpiles to JS and is run that way. Which you might imagine leads to all kinds of hellacious weirdness
[22:46:40] <slaughter> And my opinion of TypeScript is even lower than that of CDK, so it gets extra hate there
[22:46:51] <slaughter> At least CDK makes _something_ better
[22:46:51] <lantech19446> maybe that's why I suck at python lol cuz i also suck at js
[22:47:12] <slaughter> Boo hisss don't compare the snake boi with the god boi
