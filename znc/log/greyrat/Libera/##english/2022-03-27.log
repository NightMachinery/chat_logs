[15:02:42] <Voxel> Why the heck it used regardless of gender?
[15:02:57] <Voxel> It's pure nonsense
[15:03:07] <Me-me> Why would it be nonsense?
[15:03:35] <Voxel> Can you imagine a girl who says "guys" in a group of women?
[15:04:12] <Me-me> I can do more than imagine it, I've seen it, and even done it to a group of women. Nobody minded.
[15:06:03] <Me-me> But anecdotes don't matter. The point is that it's cultural. And there's a cultural shift ongoing. Soon enough it's going to have spent more time as a gender neutral term than it spent as a gendered one.
[15:07:10] <Voxel> Awful
[15:07:25] <Voxel> I didn't see any girl calling a group of women via "guys"
[15:07:33] <Voxel> It's like "men"
[15:08:57] <Me-me> Well it's interesting that you would use that term, specifically. Because that's gone in the opposite direction.
[15:09:18] <Voxel> Imho, it indicates some kind of careless towards woman as a gender.
[15:09:43] <Me-me> "Mankind" is a remnant from when "man" simply meant what we now refer to as "human", And what we now refer to as men were called wyfmen.
[15:09:46] <Me-me> .w wyfman
[15:09:47] <tinsoldier> Not found
[15:09:49] <Voxel> Some kind of equating or even forced ignorance
[15:09:53] <Me-me> Tch. It is old, I guess.
[15:10:11] <Me-me> Yeah, see, you're attributing malice and bigotry to natural linguistic shift where there really is none.
[15:10:16] <Voxel> Yes. The same with "Man" and a lot of its usage as a human.
[15:10:33] <Me-me> This is not some co-ordinated misogynist plot to maliciously refer to women with a masculine-gendered term.
[15:10:34] <Voxel> I don't understand that. It looks like the authors just didn't care about women at all
[15:10:41] <Me-me> This is a term that is losing its masculing connotations.
[15:10:55] <Me-me> *masculine
[15:11:04] <Me-me> It's allowed to happen. Why would you be mad about it?
[15:11:11] <Voxel> It looks like the term "man" was used so much that it started being considered a "person" regardless gender!
[15:11:26] <Voxel> Me-me, because it's nonsense.
[15:11:33] <Voxel> Man is man. Woman is a woman.
[15:11:43] <Me-me> Isn't that transphobic now?
[15:11:44] <Voxel> Why then they say Man is a Woman?
[15:12:02] <Me-me> Look, I've got stuff to do. You can grouse in bad faith without me.
[15:12:06] <Voxel> Why do they say then*

[15:14:32] <Voxel> Anyways, sorry. Just... I don't want to understand that since I think it's pure nonsense. However, let's drop the topic - some may consider it trolling or something due to relatively recent events. I had no intentions to raise any issues, just wanted to state the issue.
[15:16:08] <darsie> I'm having fun when a woman says "Hi guys" and I reply "Hi guy" :).
[15:17:15] <Voxel> The reason I started it because I see 90% people online say "Hey guys!", and I don't know how to response.
[15:17:59] <Voxel> Like, every single time it looks like they address to men exclusively.
[15:18:18] <Voxel> darsie, you see! That's what I'm talking about.
[15:19:17] <darsie> Are you a woman?
[15:19:43] <darsie> Or ... are you a man?
[15:19:50] <darsie> a male man
[15:19:54] <darsie> not a human.
[15:19:58] <Me-me> A wyfman.

[15:20:24] <Me-me> I'm doin' it, I'm doin' it.
[15:20:55] <Me-me> Ah crap, looks like I got it backwards anyway. werman was male, wyfman was female.
[15:21:10] <darsie> It seemed odd.
[15:21:25] <darsie> wife
[15:21:42] <Me-me> Wer- to wo- though.
[15:21:55] <darsie> to woo women?

[23:11:52] <goppo> https://youtu.be/LjSFC0QyNxw?t=14
[23:12:34] <darsie> Subtitles say Oh, Santa, great, do you ...
[23:12:44] <goppo> darsie i know. it can't be
[23:12:58] <darsie> Why not?
[23:13:01] <goppo> the auto translation must be wrong
[23:13:19] <goppo> darsie youtube has the next line as '... dance computer...'
[23:15:33] * darsie is spoiled.
[23:16:03] <blkshp> He asked me to setup a direct debit for the TV licence.

[23:16:46] <goppo> blkshp yes, but i'm referring to the 'Oh' bit
[23:16:47] <darsie> blkshp: I thought goppo was looking what was said at XXX.
[23:16:48] <goppo> Oh ???
[23:17:01] <goppo> "Oh ??? Do you know the password to Dan's computer"
[23:17:10] <goppo> darsie yeah
[23:17:19] <darsie> goppo: What's her name? Santa?
[23:17:26] <goppo> darsie i have no idea

[23:20:34] <huf> what the hell is a tv licensing ad?
[23:20:52] <darsie> In Austria we need to pay a fee for having a working TV.
[23:20:53] <blkshp> In the UK you must purchase a licence for equipment that can receive BBC/.
[23:20:55] <goppo> darsie lol
[23:21:01] <darsie> It's true.
