[14:24:47] <msfninja> is it possible to have the same key derived from a password all the time
[14:25:24] <sonOfRa> Sure, keep the salt around for key derivation
[14:26:41] <msfninja> is there a difference between hashing a password and deriving a key?
[14:26:49] <msfninja> i have only heard about salt in hashing a password
[14:27:40] <wasamasa> salts are pretty much a hard requirement to avoid telling whether a hash corresponds to a commonly chosen password
[14:28:21] <wasamasa> you can hash a password to derive a key from that
[14:28:33] <wasamasa> but there's no reason a key couldn't be derived from something else
[14:29:06] <cvmn> salt = make pre-computed brute-forcing tables useless.  key derivation uses salt, and may use other tricks, such as tricks that make calculating each key much more expensive, so that brute-forcing becomes even hardor.
[14:29:20] <msfninja> i have a design where the users password is never sent to the server, but that requires having the same key derived from that password to decrypt all data sent to the client

[23:11:24] <dostoyevsky2> I see an easy TLS example where they don't list any ciphersuites... and then I see another example where they added a lot of ciphers... e.g. TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA .. but googling for it, it turns out that cipher is not considered secure anymore... I guess it would mean that some older webbrowsers can't use my https service

[23:20:18] <euouae> Hello everyone
[23:20:32] <euouae> I'm reading a book "Serious Cryptography" and I can't understand something at the end of Chapter 2
[23:21:54] <euouae> https://paste.debian.net/1216993/ Supposedly this function creates a random float in the range 0 <= x < 1 with 16 digits after the decimal point
[23:22:08] <euouae> and there's a problem that the digit 0 is overrepresented, due to an off-by-one error 
[23:22:30] *** Quits: ingodid (~ingodid@http1.gather.info) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[23:22:57] <euouae> in line 6. The author claims entropy is 45 bits instead of 53. I've calculated 16*(-9*25/251 * log_2(25/251) - 26/251 * log_2(26/251)) and it is equal to 53.149 whereas 16*log_2(10) is equal to 53.15
[23:23:30] <euouae> So it seems that the difference in entropy is approximately 0.001... I don't understand where "43 bits" came from. Can someone explain?

[23:47:36] <maroon> euouae, im looking at it from a different angle, which probably has a flaw. these are byte values where only 251 outcomes are possible instead of 256. for a 53 bit value, it would be stored in 53/8=6.625 bytes. assuming this error only affect the 6 and not the fractional 7th where the remaining 5 bits are kept, there's only a fraction...
[23:48:12] <maroon> fraction of possible outcomes, which would be (251/256)^6 *48bits + 5bits = 47.64

[23:51:01] <euouae> It's still off from the claimed 45 
[23:54:04] <maroon> in the calculation, is an overly sampled '1' going to affect the carry flag differently than the other under-sampled byte values?
[23:54:30] <euouae> in my calculation?
[23:54:41] <maroon> no, in the real world
[23:54:59] <euouae> Which carry flag?
[23:56:50] <maroon> ok i was reading this wrong, to see that it was affecting the underlying multibyte memory storage, holdon
[23:58:29] <maroon> so this is returning a 16-digit integer based off a faulty rng?
