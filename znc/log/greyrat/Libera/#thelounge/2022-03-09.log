[00:45:51] <bookworm> johncs: you should probably assign yourself as a reviewer, not the assignee... that gets confusing if you request changes as it looks like you take over the PR
[00:46:36] <bookworm> then again, not actually sure what we agreed to do so...

[00:49:02] <val> It would be nice to make that explicit, eg. with a label
[00:49:51] <val> it's often not clear to me why a PR has no activity. (Should the author do something? Or the reviewers? Or is it just blocked by the release schedule?)
[00:50:10] <bookworm> makes sense, any preferred label name?
[00:51:45] <val> hmm... "ready to merge", with "The PR has been reviewed, and will be merged after the next release is published"?
[00:51:57] <val> as description 
[00:53:29] <bookworm> systemd has "reviewed/needs-rework" when work is expected, "good-to-merge/waiting-for-ci üëç"
[00:53:54] <bookworm> could do something similar... (was the first project I could remember that uses labels for triaging)
[00:53:56] <val> as for the review status, I don't know. Make it more explicit when you expect change from the author and/or ping them if they didn't do anything for like a month
[00:54:19] <val> yeah, something like that
[00:55:44] <val> but also, if (for example) you set the "needs-rework" label and ask for changes A and B, the author misunderstands and only does A; then you need to make it explicit you are still waiting for B
[00:55:53] <val> so the author doesn't wait on another review indefinitely
[00:56:25] <bookworm> Hm, I'd hope that the discussions within the review would make this easy to see no?
[00:56:39] <bookworm> requires some discipline when things are resolved though
[01:02:29] <val> I remember feeling confused about some of my PRs, but when re-reading them now, I don't see why I did
[01:02:51] <bookworm> sorry for that
[01:03:44] <val> actually I think it was mostly on old PRs
[01:03:51] <val> eg. https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/pull/4188
[01:04:22] <val> I have no idea why nothing is happening
[01:04:52] <bookworm> ehm, personally because I didn't have time to play with it, that's why nothing is incoming from my side
[01:04:56] <bookworm> as for the others, not sure
[01:05:29] <MaxLeiter> Nachtalb disappeared and it wasn't fleshed out enough for me to ‚úÖ
[01:05:34] <MaxLeiter> in the case of that one
[01:05:46] <MaxLeiter> we can close it but im leaving it open in case someone picks it up
[01:05:48] <toulene> the channel list does not go down far enough, is it possible to list even more channels than what the client shows me? maybe a raw text list?
[01:05:52] <MaxLeiter> but a label could be useful
[01:06:01] <MaxLeiter> toulene: that you've joined?

[01:06:32] <toulene> yes
[01:06:41] <MaxLeiter> we show you everything the server gives us, I believe 
[01:06:53] <MaxLeiter> so if a channel is missing thats a limitation on the server, we can't know more than that
[01:06:53] <val> "and it wasn't fleshed out enough for me to ‚úÖ"
[01:07:04] <val> that's what is missing
[01:07:05] <toulene> i know hexchat showed me more than thelounge did
[01:07:06] <bookworm> toulene: that scrools too
[01:07:23] <bookworm> although we probably truncate it... no use to show you 7k channels
[01:07:33] <MaxLeiter> yeah, we probably discussed it in IRC 
[01:07:38] <toulene> is there a way to bypass the truncation
[01:07:47] <MaxLeiter> you're right val, but in general that will be in the PRs themselves
[01:07:48] <bookworm> besides the obvious code modifications, no
[01:08:12] <bookworm> MaxLeiter: could just make it clear with a label and call it "needs-work" or something

[01:08:27] <MaxLeiter> or needs-new-owner
[01:08:30] <bookworm> someone more political than myself will certainly come up with a less offensive term
[01:08:43] <toulene> are there any other web-based persistent irc client alternatives/competitors to thelounge?

[01:09:10] <bookworm> or soju, never remember which is which
[01:09:12] <val> toulene: Gamja, but it requires a serve that supports draft/chathistory and "always on" to do it well

[01:09:45] <bookworm> that allows you to filter server side, rather than client side
[01:10:59] <toulene> i dont understand what you mean by serverside and clientside in this case
[01:11:46] <bookworm> serverside: do it on the ircd / services
[01:12:00] <bookworm> clientside: do it after fetching 7k channels in TL

[01:13:12] <toulene> i am no expert but i would guess 7k channels is processable and displayable in either clientside or serverside, shouldnt be too big compared to anything else these days
[01:14:02] <toulene> also who is alis?
[01:14:11] <bookworm> toulene: you're ratelimited by the server too, chances are that you won't get the full list anyhow
[01:14:22] <bookworm> alis is a bot on libera that serves to alleviate exactly that problem
[01:14:32] <bookworm> /msg alis help
[01:14:34] <toulene> ah right, thanks
[01:16:26] <bookworm> MaxLeiter, johncs ,val how about "review-pending", "ready-to-merge" and "WIP" labels? 1) blocked by us, 2) blocked by release or some such, like the newer PRs now,  3) blocked by the author, needs changes
[01:17:24] <MaxLeiter> im worried we'll see ready to merge as "okay, I can merge it", when its ready "ready-to-merge-next-milestone", but thats a little long

[01:29:42] <MaxLeiter> bookworm, would you use the ready to merge label on the 4.3.2 PRs? 
[01:29:50] <MaxLeiter> Some
[01:30:22] <MaxLeiter> sometimes ill want you or john to merge the PR (like if you propose it), and I would use the label for that 
[01:30:25] <bookworm> if that's the release after the current rc is being promoted to the actual release, yes
[01:30:48] <MaxLeiter> Yeah that‚Äôs fine with me as long as we‚Äôre clear from the start
[01:31:10] <bookworm> I mean, if you want something to be merged, ack it. The next ack will be a merge anyhow no?
[01:31:31] <bookworm> I mean I don't ack things when I merge, I'm merging it after all that *is* an ack
[01:32:12] <bookworm> but I'm fine with a 4th label too, like "next-release" or some such
[01:32:17] <bookworm> whatever is not ambiguous
[01:32:29] <bookworm> release-after-next?

[14:38:30] <val> butaxorgh: ah, you're running The Lounge in docker then
[14:38:48] <val> do you use docker-compose or something of the sort?
[14:45:37] <butaxorgh> I have docker installed on the nas and installed thelounge from it's "library"
[14:45:40] <butaxorgh> sorry I didn't mention
[14:46:03] <val> ok so you don't have a reverse proxy
[14:46:14] <val> I think the best way would be to install nginx on your NAS somehow
[14:46:23] <butaxorgh> aha hm
[14:46:35] <butaxorgh> I also have an option of setting up thelounge on a vps
[14:46:39] <butaxorgh> considering it
[14:46:43] <val> https://thelounge.chat/docs/guides/reverse-proxies
[14:46:47] <butaxorgh> thanks!
[14:47:05] <butaxorgh> didn't think about the vps in the beggining when I asked about this here, but got this idea yesterday
[14:47:33] <val> if you can run The Lounge on your NAS, then nginx should not be a problem at all
[14:54:27] <butaxorgh> yes but I thought my current setup may be a bit of a pervercy? thelounge is on the nas and then it connects to the irc bouncer (shroud)
[14:55:00] <butaxorgh> form how I see it running it on vps and connecting is somehow 'better' ? feels "more right" if I can phrase so :D
[14:55:38] <val> ah, I didn't know you also had a bouncer
[14:55:57] <val> then yes, it's best to keep them on the same machine (less moving parts = less risks of failure)
[14:57:03] <butaxorgh> yes. the bouncer isnt even on MY vps, but on friend's but since a few days I purchased one for myself 
[14:57:13] <butaxorgh> ok val thank you very much to help me figure some of it out
[14:57:25] <butaxorgh> I have near 0 *nix experience, so it is a bit hard:)

[19:59:41] <butaxorgh> also has anyone been in situation on ubuntu, when you have a super dated nodejs  (10.something) and then when you install latest version with nvm ubuntu still thinks it's current nodejs is 10.something while there is also the latest one already
[20:00:00] <butaxorgh> was trying to follow instructions on installing thelounge on ubuntu, but got stuck on this
[20:00:00] <xnaas> https://gist.github.com/xnaas/b4ceb560a5f3627fcbe5057d0f20c24a this kind of thing happens all the time, butaxorgh lol
[20:00:15] <butaxorgh> found a few links that explain how to fix it but didnt help
[20:00:37] <xnaas> I've never used nvm, but I assume it has some sort of command/option to set the default node version being used?
[20:00:40] <xnaas> Might be stuck on 10.x
[20:01:12] <xnaas> (I have a similar problem the once or twice a year I fuck with gvm [same thing but for golang])
[20:01:14] <butaxorgh> :D
[20:01:32] <butaxorgh> ok xnaas thanks Ill look into the defau;t version thing now
[20:02:12] <butaxorgh> xnaas problem with me is that I have no *nix knowledge so all I can rely on are tutorials/documentation
[20:02:15] <butaxorgh> which not always wqork for me :)
[20:02:21] <butaxorgh> thx for the hint
[20:02:37] <xnaas> 99% of the time you can do <command> --help or man <command>
[20:02:48] <xnaas> might be a lot of reading, but you'll learn a lot!
[20:03:00] <xnaas> "man" meaning "manual"
[20:04:11] <butaxorgh> oh
[20:04:24] <butaxorgh> ok , thanks
[20:04:29] <butaxorgh> gonna skim thru
[20:06:02] <butaxorgh> tho from what I recall I think I already performed some command that supposed to set nodejs version to a specific default

[22:05:45] <butaxorgh> can anyone hint me: https://pastebin.com/dCkKbE4s   <<< does this just mean I have to update all the listed things marked with warning?
[22:05:56] <butaxorgh> well, not just, it might be a bitch, but just so I can understand better
[22:33:16] <bookworm> nothing you can do about it
[22:33:29] <bookworm> the next release will upgrade quite a few of those
[22:34:02] <bookworm> but it's something the project needs to do, kot you as a sysadmin
[22:37:00] <xnaas> speaking of releases...MaxLeiter...can we make an exception for "no more new stuff" and have #4506 in the next rc? :P
[22:37:19] * xnaas dying over here
[22:43:08] <kinghat> im going to work on a couple features, but first, how do you all feel about me adding vscode dev container configs to the repo? that way people can just fork TL and vscode will start it all up and off they go?

[22:45:28] <bookworm> no need to litter the repo with files for that, just do that locally

[22:46:51] <bookworm> editor configs really should not be part of a code repo, like at all. Don't care if there's a fancy vs code instance in the GitHub cloud
[22:47:01] <kinghat> you mean like these? https://irc.kinghat.xyz/uploads/42a010d180bf8afa/image.png 
[22:48:10] <bookworm> yes, exactly like these
[22:48:12] <kinghat> this is to run locally, never used the cloud bit.
[22:48:48] <bookworm> if one adds a config, at least make it and editor config in the standardized form
[22:50:34] <kinghat> clearly the project has an affinity for vscode, making the developer experience better via config files that have no affect on people not using vscode seems worth it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[22:51:19] <bookworm> then let me add vimrc, init.vim, emacs config...
[22:51:50] <bookworm> it proliferates endlessly for no reason. A big chunk of editor configs is personal preference 
[22:52:30] <kinghat> im fine with it. are you keep your editor configs separately?
[22:52:55] <bookworm> hm?
[22:54:18] <kinghat> its only half editor config, the other half is building the development container
[22:55:31] <bookworm> https://editorconfig.org/ is a sane choice for things which are stylistic, but in our case that's moot considering that we use a formatter
[22:56:08] <bookworm> as for dev container, you need yarn and that's it... we're in js land after all, what do you need a container for?
[23:02:29] <McInkay> fnutt: that didn't support the sqlite db, it was just for looking through text logs and searching them
[23:02:34] <McInkay> mclog that is
[23:05:03] <kinghat> you need node, yarn, and all the deps, just want to keep it containerized.
