[02:23:59] <bpalmer> replace-regexp-in-string has to be non-interactive, because strings don't exist for the end user, only buffers.

[02:42:09] <bpalmer> ,fontset
[02:42:10] <fsbot> FontSet is [0/4] at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FontSets
[02:42:10] <fsbot> [1] (info "(emacs)Fontsets")
[02:42:10] <fsbot> [2] tells emacs what fonts to use for what characters
[02:42:10] <fsbot> [3] emacs comes with two of them predefined, but you can define your own, too
[02:42:10] <fsbot> [4] available from the menu on shift-mouse-1.

[02:42:34] <bpalmer> to use those fonts, you'll have to have an emacs compiled with the right support
[02:43:04] <bpalmer> I think xft support may be all that's needed
[02:44:42] <bpalmer> although before you use anything from there, double check the licensing; at least one of those says it's non-free and "paid", so you might be obligated to purchase a license

[22:18:53] <johnjaye> the problem with that steve yegge post is that a lot of programming is actually just doing research
[22:18:58] <wgreenhouse> Unicorn_Princess: dired can add subdirs to a flat directory view (try pressing i on a subdir in dired to see this). it can also parse output from `find` and similar. but will always look like a list not a tree.
[22:19:05] <johnjaye> like. reading a boring textbook or something and trying to figure out even the basics of what's going on
[22:19:18] <wgreenhouse> ,,speedbar,, can be a tree
