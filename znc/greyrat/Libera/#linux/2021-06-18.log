[02:27:58] <NeilRG> long story short, I have no idea what an NI shell is why some things should be configured in .profile

[02:42:26] <draeath> Kyv: i gather he's trying to test behavior of the different ways of invoking bash and how they interacti with pyenv. SSH was just a red herring.
[02:42:34] <Dagmar> Also, sshd not appearing in a normal users $PATH is normal.  Ahem
[02:42:39] <NeilRG> draeath, ssh was just a way to get an NI shell

[02:56:18] <NeilRG> draeath, then you're pretty much the expert we need.   We really just need to understand whether pyenv should be configured in .profile or .zshrc (just like .bashrc)
[02:56:19] <draeath> oh wow I added python 3.5.5 to pyenv :D
[02:56:23] <draeath> i had totally forgotten about that
[02:56:58] <NeilRG> draeath, if you could weigh in on the pull request it would really help (whatever you think is best, I don't need you to agree with me; I just want to get this resolved)
[02:57:01] <draeath> NeilRG: you saw this? https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/README.md#advanced-configuration

[02:57:58] <NeilRG> draeath, beautful, thanks
[02:58:02] <draeath> Personally, I want pyenv in my shell at all times, login, interactive, noninteractive. I'm crazy that way. So I wrote my dotfiles so it always happens, but i put guards in so it only happens once (so no redundant path additions etc)

[02:59:17] <msiism> One thing to note is that if stuff is configured only in ~/.profile, then if you `su`, root's ~/.profile won't be read.
[02:59:21] <draeath> NeilRG: also there's zsh references in that readme, search for em. It suggests to me that you use .profile the same way you do for bash, and instead of .bashrc you use .zprofile ?
[02:59:25] <msiism> You'd have tu use `su -`.

[02:59:42] <msiism> This can be pretty annoying.
[02:59:45] <draeath> msiism: I use 'sudo -i' or 'sudo -s' instead of su myself

[04:35:09] <ayecee> be the change you want to see in the world, even if it's a dumb change
[04:35:21] <akik> de-facto: xkill is the one you want
[04:35:25] <de-facto> this really annoys me like hell, if i click the [x] the app must disappear from my RAM immediately
[04:35:37] <de-facto> with all its children
[04:35:43] <ayecee> that's dumb

[04:35:52] <ayecee> your annoyance is annoying
[04:35:58] <tusko> Where are launchers (like from the start menu) usualyy located?
[04:36:04] <akik> ayeceeance?
[04:36:13] <akik> tusko: /usr/share/applications
[04:36:45] <koszik> why would that be dumb? if one wants to kill programs with [x] why shouldn't they do that? the question is if it's possible to easily reprogram what [x] does, instead of notifying the prograp to exit please, to send the unforgiving signal of 9

[04:37:12] <ayecee> it's mostly in how it's expressed
[04:37:32] <de-facto> well it seriously annoys me, because i have many apps open, then in the overview i click on the [x] and the effect is that somewhere a popup appears asking me if i am really really sure. then i have to find that popup and tell it "yes, when i click the [x] i want to close the app, please", then i have to go in the expose again to close the next app

[04:37:32] <ayecee> the idea, meh. the expression, completely dumb.
[04:37:42] <de-facto> do that 20 times and even you would be annoyed i guess
[04:37:45] <ash666> can keybind to force kill a program no?
[04:37:47] <ayecee> yeah, i get that it annoys you. shut up about it.

[12:52:41] <node1> gry, Thanks. It would be more conveninet if you have used everything on single command line after pip

[12:53:57] <tango_uniform_xr> it won't exactly make sure the host doesn't use the cores at all, but from my experience linux's cpu scheduling is pretty good, so if you assign a high priority to the process then other stuff won't be able to take cpu from it

[13:01:34] <MichaelLong> Beam, yes one argument against it: it is no very suitable for desktop virtualization
[13:02:04] <clemens3> once your set with qemu, you can use all the parameters from command line, not gui like virtualbox.. however, maybe vbox offers also command line stuff

[13:05:35] <clemens3> might ask in vbox and qemu channels then.. they both are in oftc network however
[13:06:00] <Beam> MichaelLong: i don't need much for hardware support, unless vm graphics is totally crap?
[13:07:13] <MichaelLong> Beam, AFIAK there are no nice frontend helping with copy & paste, selecting USB-devices for passthrough, etc. and the grafical output is display via spice or vnc. but if you want to use RDP anyway this mostly does not matter to you

[13:11:01] <clemens3> why you care it is running on specific cores? for supervision?
[13:11:06] <MichaelLong> core pinning is not soo easy even with KVM. I was able to do with a little scripting for my vmware workstation setup on my linux work laptop
[13:11:35] <Beam> seems liek this for kvm:  <vcpu placement='static' cpuset='0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28'>8</vcpu>
[13:12:06] <Beam> clemens3: i don't want host being busy to affect a vm
[13:12:09] <MichaelLong> Beam, that's only one part. you also need to make sure those cores are exclusive to the VM, basically shield from other host OS processes
[13:12:26] <Beam> MichaelLong: yea i linked earlier a way to exclude cores from os through grub
[13:12:37] <MichaelLong> Beam, isolcpu?
[13:12:57] <Beam> yes
[13:13:08] <clemens3> well, the host is host, nothing todo with the vm then, not?
[13:13:20] <MichaelLong> I'm using cgroups with cset, it allow for a dynamic allocation, sometimes I would like to have all cores for the host
[13:13:29] <clemens3> unless the vm handles the host to stay the uck out of his reserved cores
[13:14:11] <Beam> well that was i was hoping for, but i don't think any vm does this

I disbaled my primary hard drive on my couputed and tried booting from an external usb drive which is a cloned copy of the internal drive that is disabled. The system booted, but had some issues with mouse and stuff (that is irrelevant at
[13:22:10] <sozuba> this point), i checked with kde parition manager and the only disk and paritions showing were that from the cloned external usb drive with the right mount points. Then i reboot with the external drive removed and the internal drive enabled again, and i somehow see the file i created in this disk. WHat the heck happend? :( Is there a link or resource i can read more about it and understand?

[16:33:07] <sozuba> MichaelLong, libata.force=ID:disable is what i was looking for i guess. Some one asked a similar quesiton on how to make a kernel disable ignore the hard disk through commandline and the a user had created a patch and even made a commit to upstream. The question was for SSDs but I hope this works for all disks.
[16:33:18] <jim> the best thing, I'm guessing, is if you keep the old libc and also have the new libc there

[18:44:01] <sumthing1980> hello can you tell me how to install a mailserver on a vps cloud instance ?
[18:44:59] <johnnyapol> that's not really something you'd want to do for a number of reasons -- email is hard. but if you're interested in learning, there's lots of guides available on your favorite search engine
[18:45:19] <johnnyapol> im not going to link any just because i cant vet the security of what the ones ive seen recommend

[18:45:41] <jim> sumthing1980, what os is it running?

Read a comment, logged into windows, downaloded easus data recovery and it has detected the 16Gb. Should I have done something else in linux to have made this work? or is Easus really that good?

[22:57:09] <hexnewbie> (probably misdiagnosed, since what I observed didn't make sense, given what I know about dentry cache)
[22:57:25] <phogg> hexnewbie: that's surprising, but interesting. So you're thinking the VFS data structures got too large? I think that's theoretically sound.
[22:57:29] <Dagmar> ...but it's definitely going to incur a penalty time for accessing RAM, and you can forget whatever you might have just been doing that was formerly happily running out of on-die cache
[22:57:56] <ayecee> Dagmar: so if that's the cause for swap with swappiness=0, why couldn't the page be moved to another zone instead of swap?

[22:59:30] <ayecee> if an anonymous page can be pushed to swap, why could it not be pushed to another zone? that's not in the paragraph.
[22:59:30] <Dagmar> Those zones exist--afaik--because they each represent a distinctly different expectation about how that memory is being used
[22:59:31] <hexnewbie> phogg: dentry and inode cache for 300 million files* had accumulated, and the server was acting up. (* the files on the server, don't know how many were actually cached at the time, but it was looping over all of them continuously)
[22:59:49] <Butterfly^> i thought i was quite clear on how swappiness worked in general, but the zero swappiness still using swap is what threw me off
[23:00:15] <hexnewbie> Oh, and the dentries are about the inodes multiplied by three, so 900 million.
[23:00:32] <phogg> hexnewbie: that's quite a lot. How much RAM on that box?

[23:01:35] <Dagmar> What guarantee do you have that copying memory from one region to anotehr is going to save anything?

[23:53:27] <jbis> I am building an application with two parts. The first is a background app that runs all the time and executes commands as scheduled. This runs with root privileges. The second is the frontend GUI app that users can use to control that background process (this is a pretty common setup on macOS). I need a way to communicate between these two processes and Unix Sockets seems like a good way. My problem is security. I don't want to create a situation where
[23:53:27] <jbis> any process owned by the user can start running whatever commands they want with root privileges.
[23:54:59] <zamnedix> jbis: uh, you are looking to reimplement systemd, cron, and dbus?

[23:55:10] <zamnedix> sounds to me like you only need to write the frontend
[23:55:31] <Bocaneri> What kinds of commands does the background app run?
[23:55:53] <mckayshirou> i think he says, a app that can be modified by the user to run programs a root
[23:55:55] <solar_sea> jbis, you can use posix messaging for this - mq_open(3) will accept a mode parameter on linux and ensure that a queue is created with permissions akin those of files

[23:57:03] <jbis> zamnedix no
[23:57:21] <solar_sea> jbis, you can also have anonymous shared memory if the processes are setup in such way and no other process will be able to map it
[23:58:11] <jbis> the process should be separate
[23:58:26] <johnnyapol> yeah anonymous shared memory, such as anonymous pipes would be the best way to ensure only those two processes can talk to each other
[23:58:30] <jbis> because the GUI app maybe closed or even the user maybe logged out and background still needs to run
