[00:09:08] <dostoyevsky2> In other files we can refer to the passwords via their ids.. so you can just open the page for that id and if you have the permission it will decrypt the pw and show it to you for a short time

I guess the question is what really is the cloud, and is e.g. amazon output still "the cloud"... but if you are bank you can just get an on prem version of at least AWS/Azure...  while still having the API you are used to

[00:38:54] <TunnelJ> this was a big travel GDS
[00:45:17] <dostoyevsky2> But the idea of format preserving encryption still feels quite dangerous to me... that you can take a sensitve PII and replace it with a token that has the same format as the PII, just with a very large translation table... it just seems weak

[00:53:22] <dostoyevsky2> I guess it also depends on your PII... if it's the birth year of a customer, tokenizing it will not change the distribution, so replacing it with a token will not make it hard to reverse.... I guess tokenization might only work well with cases where the PIIs are uniformly distributed
[00:54:38] <hg> hmm
[00:55:14] <hg> fun to think of a small scheme to create a commitment and associated zkp proving that you know a valid credit card number

[06:15:26] <halosghost> what kind of file? (e.g., is it structured? a single binary blob?)
[06:15:34] <halosghost> and what kind of parts?
[06:16:28] <hashfuncadb> halosghost: a structured file. and, for example, every other line, or something similar
[06:17:19] <halosghost> okay, more specifically, what kind of file?
[06:17:23] <halosghost> what are you trying to accomplish?
[06:20:55] <hashfuncadb> halosghost: to be able to encrypt/decrypt, at will, any part of a structured file that can be identified by a pattern
[06:21:26] <halosghost> that is not what you're trying to accomplish (I suspect)
[06:21:40] <halosghost> I suspect you're hoping that doing so would solve what you're trying to accomplish
[06:21:57] <halosghost> (unless you're asking purely out of speculative interest)
[06:22:58] <hashfuncadb> what?
[06:23:32] <halosghost> but, for example, JOSE is a way of signing/encrypting JSON objects (that are themselves encoded in JSON objects)
[06:24:00] <halosghost> (though JOSE has lots of pitfalls)
[06:24:34] <ms7821> it's not very clean but ansible does it with hex-encoded structures https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html
[06:25:31] <hashfuncadb> halosghost: ok, i think those examples will be good enough. thanks for the help
[06:26:08] <halosghost> hashfuncadb: what I was getting at is that that's such a general question that it's kind of hard to imagine that that's really what you want (it seems much more likely that there's a particular type of file you're interested in encrypting parts of and those parts are recognizeable by a pattern)
[06:26:34] <halosghost> that's not to say that you couldn't be interested in the general question (though answers to it are kind of hard given how wide the field is)
[06:26:41] <halosghost> hashfuncadb: I'm glad it was helpful ☺
[06:29:07] <ms7821> one thing I'd say is that you usually see encryption encapsulated inside some sort of record structure
[06:29:23] <ms7821> (rather than, e.g. a header followed by various different ciphertexts)
[06:30:21] <ms7821> that's for the best, because you don't really want to start sharing things between ciphertexts (that way lies attacks)
[06:31:49] <ms7821> I'll excuse zip files because they were designed a long time ago

[18:03:56] <varayu> I tried compressing my keys with, "cat [PRIV KEY] | grep -vP '^-' | base64 -d | zstd --ultra -22 | base64", which was almost the same size
[18:04:13] <gevreeen> so again it proves compression doesn't really work
[18:04:54] <gevreeen> and we could expand alphabets
[18:05:36] <gevreeen> mixing base64 and mkhedruli perhaps
[18:06:15] <gevreeen> with care we can make it base96
[18:06:44] <gevreeen> the point being we need a much larger alphabet
[18:07:06] <gevreeen> hmm, maybe some mapping to chinese making it base256?
[18:10:04] *** Quits: BOKALDO (~BOKALDO@user/bokaldo) (Quit: Leaving)
[18:10:52] *** Joins: voker57 (~quassel@2a06:1700:0:24::)
[18:11:23] <gevreeen> yeah, just taking mapping to the most often used chinese characters, and base4096 wouldn't be a problem, just pick one of the 2022 encodings and work from there
[18:11:24] <piou> gevreeen: a larger alphabet will make things shorter, but that's absolutely equivalent to compression
[18:11:49] <piou> gevreeen: you'll never be shorter than the best compression possible, and that compression is still going to be long by design
[18:12:24] <piou> I'd just print it or take a photo, no point in trying to find a quicker way to write it by pen than copying the whole thing
[18:13:27] <gevreeen> let's see. with base4096 I would be trading 4096/8 = 512 bytes for a single chinese character, which in binary representation would take 2 bytes for the usual 2022 mapping
[18:14:19] <varayu> Or generate a QR code
[18:14:48] <gevreeen> the compression ratio is then 256 for a binary representation. no, I wanna write it down in a notebook
[18:15:19] <piou> gevreeen: if you have a 4096 bit key, then you're going to need 4096 bits to represent it
[18:15:59] <piou> gevreeen: if you get lucky you might have a pattern in the random number that shaves off a few bits, but you'll never get much lower
[18:16:15] <gevreeen> uhm, wait, I got it wrong 4096 characters make 2**12
[18:17:06] <gevreeen> so I could write 12 bits a time, which is roughtly 350s chinese characters
[18:17:21] <gevreeen> which 5 lines
[18:17:41] <gevreeen> (80 chars per line. still looks like an improvement to me)
[18:18:53] <piou> if you use an alphabet 2**12 chars large you can use only one char! But you're going to need a reference table that has 2**12 entries
[18:19:33] <piou> so the question is, how are you managing the encoding of these chinese chars
[18:19:41] <gevreeen> essentially pick one of the 16 planes of cns1164 or base gb2312
[18:19:46] <gevreeen> 11643
[18:20:08] <gevreeen> and grab the first 4096 characters
[18:20:34] <TimMc> Also see https://qntm.org/twitcodings
[18:20:41] <piou> Do they even cover all bit representations?
[18:21:36] <gevreeen> 96*96 per plane, that should be more than enough
[18:22:27] <piou> that's not the question is it?
[18:22:46] <gevreeen> base65536 would not be practical however, as it's hard to discern a greek upper case alpha from latin upper case A, and I'm farely certain some of the planes are full
[18:22:57] <gevreeen> s/farely/fairly/
[18:23:42] <gevreeen> and even in the case where a mapping is missing I could just move forward
[18:23:42] <TimMc> Oh, does this need to be visually distinct? I missed that.
[18:23:57] <gevreeen> (I'm committing this thing to paper)
[18:25:41] <piou> I think you're going to get ambiguous results and that's even assuming you'll find recognizing chinese characters from hand writting easy enough to avoid any typo when recovering the key
[18:27:18] <TimMc> You're *sure* you can't use ed25519 instead of rsa? :-)
[18:27:36] <piou> I really doubt that it's worth the trouble of not using something like 64 and taking a bit more time when writting (not mentionning that for recovery I'm sure base64 would be much more OCR friendly than handwritten chinese hanzi characters
[18:27:48] <piou> )
[18:28:13] <piou> and ed25519 would probably prove a better space improvement anyway
[18:28:41] <TimMc> When I had to commit a large RSA key to paper, what I did was encyrpt it with a diceware-style passphrase, print the encrypted thing, and then hand-write the passphrase on the paper.
[18:29:04] <piou> I like the idea
[18:29:08] <TimMc> This way the printer never gets to store a plain copy of the private key.
[18:29:10] <piou> keeping that
[18:29:27] <gevreeen> (it's easy to conflate 1 and i in certain people's handing writing as well)
[18:29:49] <gevreeen> s/handing writing/handwriting/
[18:29:53] <piou> base32 then
[18:30:20] <piou> my point is, sure it's longer, but you only need to do it once, and it doesn't matter if recovery doesn't work
[18:31:00] <piou> I'd rather focus on making recovery as resistant to mistakes as possible, because if it comes down to it you really need it to work
[18:31:30] <gevreeen> ambiguous characters and recovery... maybe attach a copy of the cangjie input representation of the chars?
[18:31:45] <TimMc> You could also probably find or create a program to do error recovery on a transcribed key.

[20:05:40] <Alipha> thomas25: the two thoughts that come to mind: it's less convenient for someone (like me) who doesn't have issues remembering passwords / uses a password manager. secondly, email is viewed as insecure, but i'm not sure how much of that is really true anymore, since the majority of people access their mail over https (e.g., through a browser).

[20:18:21] <TimMc> The links are only valid for a few minutes.

[20:21:18] <thomas25> and before critical operations a SMS verification code
[20:21:35] <thomas25> (though it's known that SMS can be hijacked rather easier than above mentioned methods)
[20:21:43] <thomas25> (they social engineer GSM operator to transfer the number)
[20:22:10] <thomas25> i'm considering using Firebase SDK for above proposed solution (it provides all that).
[20:22:31] <thomas25> but i also have reserveations on using a 3rd party SDK/service to facilitate that kind of critcial part of my app
[20:23:18] <MacGyver> If you provide password reset functionality through e-mail, then providing *login* functionality through e-mail does not degrade your security.
[20:23:23] <Alipha> iz: people who wouldn't already be able to access those emails because they work for said email provider? also, i thought that server-to-server connections had the option to be encrypted (though vulnerable to a downgrade attack)

[20:23:42] <thomas25> MacGyver that's a logical truth indeed
[20:24:01] <iz> most server-to-server email stuff is unencrypted, so it's not even intercepting so much as it is just looking at the traffic as it goes by
[20:24:33] <MacGyver> I wonder about that. Server-to-server supports TLS and e-mail nowadays doesn't really do relaying.
[20:25:03] <iz> i guess the last time i really sniffed email traffic was like 15 years ago now

[20:25:55] <MacGyver> Even if it's just TLS, and even if you still have to trust the server admins.

[20:26:31] <MacGyver> I think it is.
[20:26:32] <iz> b/c email is already considered insecure, so it's more trouble than it's worth

[21:32:23] <thomas25> hg apparently there have been some cases of hijacked GSM number. So, single SMS login sounds less safe than email link login to me.
[21:33:10] <thomas25> i don't think you can trick google to give you access to someone else's email address but apprently you can trick some GSM opererators to transfer the number to you
[21:33:21] <edk> you don't even necessarily need to trick the operator

[21:34:03] <hg> oh, you're totally fine ☺
[21:34:21] <thomas25> edk what do you mean
[21:34:27] <edk> i think email-as-login is not obviously more insecure than email-as-account-recovery, which itself seems honestly pretty good relative to any of the other ways we have to authenticate people
[21:34:40] <edk> there are routing-level attacks against phone infrastructure just like there are against internet infrastructure
[21:34:57] <thomas25> but aren't the hops authenticate with each other
[21:35:21] <thomas25> i'd imagine they'd implement that after gsm 1.0 (pseudo tech code name)
[21:35:21] <hg> edk: email-as-recovery is largely equivalent to email-as-login
[21:35:39] <hg> edk: the egregious bit gets to be when sites leak that an email has an account

[21:38:38] <edk> since access to phone trunking has become a bit easier to get in recent years it's no longer guaranteed that anyone with a phone trunk can hijack any number, but that was true once
[21:39:14] <thomas25> when was it possible?
[21:39:53] <edk> well it was probably possible in 2005
[21:40:07] <edk> this is not a subject i claim to be an expert in, to be clear
[21:40:59] <thomas25> i was going to say "15 years?" but didn't want to make more assumptions
[21:42:02] <edk> it's almost certainly still possible if you're a three-letter agency but i guess most of us just have to assume that if one of those wants our accounts we're screwed
[21:42:20] <thomas25> three letter agency will just get it from operator
[21:43:13] <edk> yeah, or activate a backdoor in your device, or physically steal the device, or blackmail the service into handing over your data
[21:43:45] <thomas25> btw, i checked recently if it's possible to have a ham radio input to computer and do the gsm completely in software, rather than requiring a vendor chip... iirc it turns out you indeed can do that for initial versions of gsm

[22:44:04] <thomas25> I have N devices connecting to a Gateway device. N <-> Gateway is an electronic bus communication and trusted. Gateway connects all these devices to a relay server for further logging, displaying etc.
[22:44:40] <thomas25> Gateway is an embedded device so the less we implement the better.
[22:45:46] <thomas25> If I want to verify the authenticity of the relay server in gateway. What to do? HTTPS is the way to go probably? (but i wonder if it'd require a real time clock, or i can just get time on the Gateway via NTP and just use lower precision MCU clock to keep track of time)
[22:46:05] <thomas25> a simpler solution that comes to my mind is that i can challenge the relay server with a random number and the relay must sign it
[22:46:24] <thomas25> and i can verify it in the gateway, so that i know the relay is who she claims to be
[22:47:39] <thomas25> I can also implement in production line a way to create priv/pub key pairs for each Gateway and store only the public key of it, so that gateways can sign their messages as well.
[22:47:44] <thomas25> do you think that can replace https?
[22:47:50] <thomas25> in this scenario i mean
[22:55:05] <TimMc> That might get you proof of identity, but not all the confidentiality and integrity properties of TLS.

[22:59:15] <thomas25> and maybe we can also use public key encryption in the body of the signed message? (so we have confidentiality as well)

[23:01:27] <thomas25> you can't change the body? (that's what i call integrity)

[23:02:18] <thomas25> but TLS is also much more complex with all the certificates and stuff, i lack experience
[23:02:20] <Alipha> thomas25: you'd probably also need to prevent replay attacks
[23:02:21] <TimMc> Alipha: Yes, but is there additional metadata? What about replay attacks? etc.
[23:02:26] <TimMc> jinx
[23:02:31] <thomas25> Alipha good point, can be solved in the body as well

[23:04:34] <Alipha> thomas25: if you're encrypting, signing, and preventing replay attacks, you're pretty much just reimplementing TLS, in which case, it seems much easier to just use TLS. And creating self-signed certificates shouldn't be hard. Or use let's encrypt. Just because you're unfamiliar with something, doesn't mean it's hard :-)
[23:04:39] *** Joins: cehteh (~ct@git.pipapo.org)
[23:07:29] <thomas25> true true...
[23:08:09] <ms7821> letsencrypt is far preferable to self-signed certs imo
[23:09:00] <thomas25> why
[23:09:15] <thomas25> but it requires rotation right? but only on the relay server side, so it should be easy
[23:09:16] <ms7821> key management is hard, CA tooling is bad
[23:10:01] <thomas25> we can afford a regular certificate too i guess, it'd be good marketing point? :)
[23:10:06] <ms7821> you would need to consider what happens when LE's root CA expires/changes, but imo that's easier than running your own CA
[23:10:36] <thomas25> ah, then gateway needs to update CA as well
[23:10:45] *** Quits: Klotz (~Klotzoman@gateway/tor-sasl/klotz) (Quit: Klotz)
[23:10:48] <thomas25> and we need to secure that as well but that'd be easy with digital signature i guess
[23:13:52] <thomas25> hmm but even other issuers CA will expire at some point, no?
[23:14:07] <thomas25> so how's LE different in that aspect?
[23:15:10] <thomas25> btw, if i re-implement TLS, i'm aware that i will probably do a worse job at it than TLS but I will complete understanding of what's happening so there's that

[23:32:10] <ms7821> I'm not suggesting LE is different, but if you ran your own CA you could put a huge expiry on the root CA
[23:32:29] <ms7821> (I still don't recommend running your own CA)

[23:50:15] <thomas25> ms7821 so gateway devices need to update CA. is there a standard procedure for that. it'd be disasterous if the gateway fail to do so and hence fail communication
[23:50:34] <thomas25> i think a plaintext messaging fallback is a must as well
[23:50:44] <ms7821> what's the lifetime of the gateway?
