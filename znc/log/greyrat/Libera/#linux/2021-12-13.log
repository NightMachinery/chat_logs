[00:06:36] <TheGuestMovie> OK, this is sorta offtopic but since we're on the subject of backups...you guys should know that TrueNAS (FreeNAS's new name) is now no longer FreeBSD only, they also have a Linux version, called TrueNAS Scale. So the same apps, on a different base OS. You can use that on your home server.
[00:06:39] <NGC3982> ayecee: yes, i am. the question mark indicated my general insecurity towards pretty much anything.

[00:07:16] <TheGuestMovie> akik: it's just some buzzword to distinguish between the FreeBSD version and the Linux version
[00:07:20] <hexnewbie> NGC3982: Also adding -ls at the end makes it more informative
[00:07:32] <ayecee> NGC3982: reason i ask is that if you transfer an rsnapshot tree with rsync, you'd need to include options to track hardlinks, otherwise it's going to transfer a lot that it doesn't have to.
[00:07:33] <TheGuestMovie> calling it "TrueNAS Linux" would've been harder for search engines

[00:08:10] <ayecee> NGC3982: but i'm not sure how you have rsnapshot configured, and it's possible rsnapshot has features that it didn't when i used it.
[00:08:17] <msiism> Sayona: Or, what do you want to be able to protect against?
[00:08:23] <ayecee> NGC3982: for me, i had to do the rsnapshot job, then rsync the files.

[00:22:51] <ayecee> eh. it would be a good idea to check on the remote whether the snapshots are already using hardlinks. take a look at the same file in two different snapshots and see if they have the same inode number from ls -i
[00:23:27] <hexnewbie> Even if you create a snapshot with cp -al, you still need rsync to feed the new state, even if you don't use --linkdest. So whether the hardlinks would be broken up depends on when rsync thinks the file changed

[01:36:52] <Sauvin> SrainUser, the potential exists at least partially because it can't be certain that the contents of a given snap correspond to freely available source code. You can't know what's in it or how it was built.
[01:37:23] <pulsar12> im playing with luks and was trying to experiment changing the master keys in live memory while dm block device is active. my expectation was the data to appear different after changing just one bit of the key, but i dont see difference. what am i might be missing here?
[01:37:51] <ayecee> pulsar12: the master key is not the encryption key

I installed a package called rogauracore for my laptops LGB keyboard to get it to light up. I put the folder into the home dir and then went through the install. My problem is the package won't work for me, I went through all the steps, and so I decided to install a previous version, just to
[04:19:21] <ranger> check and learn, so if I install the older program will it over right the newer version or should I remove and purge the new version first, then install the previous version? Just looking for advice, whats the best option?

[06:22:34] <bindi> so I have a weird problem, when I'm selfhosting teamspeak, sometimes my users packet loss goes through the roof - they have total blackout (they cant hear us, we cant hear him). I've tested this on a fresh ubuntu install (totally different pc) straight to the ethernet uplink, no firewalls, public ip and it still persists
[06:22:39] <bindi> so it's an issue with my ISP
[06:22:59] <bindi> but it only seems to affect *incoming* teamspeak (udp), when I'm connected to my Hetzner server, no packet loss for me whatsoever
[06:23:28] <bindi> any tips for troubleshooting or pinning down the problem or wtf to tell my ISP? they're all just dumbfounded by it and sent a technician to change my port (in the basement switch) and hope it fixes it
[06:23:39] <Dagmar> It's just affecting one user?
[06:23:42] <bindi> we all have the same isp, live in the same city, everyone has ethernet/fiber (<1ms ping)
[06:23:45] <bindi> no
[06:23:48] <bindi> one user at a time
[06:23:52] <bindi> but multiple users
[06:24:07] *** pong is now known as beaver
[06:24:19] <Dagmar> Unless it continues for long periods of time, it's UDP.
[06:24:26] <bindi> i ran mtr with my friend for 30 minutes (both directions) and it said 0.0% loss while he got multiple blackouts in teamspeak
[06:24:32] <Dagmar> Routers are allowed to discard UDP/ICMP for any reason they see fit
[06:24:40] <bindi> this shouldn't happen though
[06:24:46] <bindi> literally getting cut mid speech
[06:25:04] <bindi> it started after my ISP upgraded the basement switch from Cisco fastethernet to Huawei 1gig
[06:25:14] <Dagmar> The 'U' stands for 'unreliable' by design
[06:25:31] <bindi> so why isn't everyone having this issue on every teamspeak server?

[06:27:23] <Dagmar> bindi: The short of it is that the buffer sizes that are the _default_ for the kernel are acceptable for fast ethernet, but not for gigabit ethernet
[06:27:55] <Dagmar> bindi: What it amounts to is that the buffer has X amount of space.  Packets come in, go into the buffer, and _then_ are claimed by the applications listening for them

[06:28:56] <Dagmar> bindi: If you're on gigglebit ethernet, pretty much two jumbo frames full of UDP hitting one after the other means the first batch just rolls right off before any application has a chance to get that data
[06:29:04] <bindi> yeah I have 1000/400
[06:29:25] <Dagmar> bindi: This is _super fun_ when you're dealing with a host doing monitoring/datacollection for 600+ hosts via SNMP
[06:29:45] <bindi> should I go with that value in the cuwb.io post?
[06:29:56] <Dagmar> It's a perfectly reasonable value
[06:30:21] <bindi> so why isn't this the default when 1Gbit lan has been a thing for the past 15 years?
[06:30:59] <Dagmar> bindi: Because most of the distributions and all of the sysadmins who take their jobs seriously started setting that value higher when they transitioned to using gigglebit ethernet
[06:31:44] <Dagmar> Don't get crazy and set it to some absurdly high value
[06:31:48] <lockywolf> Dagmar, ntpq -p prints "connection refused"
[06:32:00] <bindi> i went with the value mentioned in the blog post thingy
[06:32:05] <Dagmar> Despite what crappy bloggers say, it's not something that will "increase performance"
[06:32:33] <bindi> i see there are other tunables as well, wmem, do i care?
[06:32:35] <Dagmar> It's a matter of either you've allocated a large enough buffer, or the kernel just starts throwing away UDP your processes haven't claimed yet

[06:33:59] <Dagmar> bindi: Don't care.
[06:33:59] <bindi> so pfsense <-> proxmox box was always 1gig anyway, pfsense <-> isp basement switch upgraded from fe to 1gig
[06:34:04] <bindi> right
[06:34:25] <Dagmar> The default kernel settings are simply too small for gigabit ethernet.

[08:55:51] <Psi-Jack> Yep.
[08:56:00] <Psi-Jack> Arch is hardly "mainstream".
[08:56:04] <Sauvin> zulc22, most do, yes, but not necessarily on this net. Debian, for example, is official on OFTC if I'm not mistaken.

[09:35:39] <zulc22> I think that may be a little bit much? that question seems like it comes from a complete beginner
[09:35:49] <SrainUser> isn't bit flipping something that happens in HDDs?
[09:35:50] <node1> Sauvin, I don't understand? :(  are you sharing proving it using assembly code?
[09:35:58] <Sauvin> Yes.

[09:36:40] <SrainUser> But don't worry about it. Bit flipping happens in HDDs that haven't been powered on in YEARS.
[09:36:56] <zulc22> he said it like he meant memory
[09:37:05] <zulc22> node do you mean memory or hard drives
[09:37:05] <Sauvin> It was just an example. A great deal of low-level work in C or assembly language when you're programming against the metal is in isolating a given bit in a byte (e.g., a control register), reversing its sense, re-integrating into the byte it was extracted from, and restoring the byte.

[14:02:06] <Mister_Magister> basically, i have issue with one device in /dev i cannot access it (as a root mind you). There's no selinux or apparmor. Linux version is 3.4, the kernel is android kernel and the device is /dev/adsprpc-smd
[14:02:14] <Mister_Magister> and i can't figure out what could prevent me from accessing it
[14:02:16] <koollman> I mean, I'm fairly sure most bsd distributions would be offended to be added in there, but MIT ? :)
[14:02:29] <akik> Mister_Magister: all things linux except android
[14:02:31] <Mister_Magister> I'm fairly certain at this point that it's not kernel fault but something in userspace
[14:02:41] <Mister_Magister> akik: ssshhh i'm still talking about linux
[14:02:54] <Mister_Magister> not an actual android
[14:03:02] <Mister_Magister> just the android kernel and its adsprpc
[14:03:44] <Mister_Magister> If i said i'm using sailfishos yall would just be hating on me xd
[14:03:58] <Mister_Magister> but ye i'm searching for suggestions what could prevent me from accessing it
[14:04:48] <Mister_Magister> i tried booting kernel on which it was working fine previously but that didn't change anything so i don't think its kernel space but since i don't have selinux/apparmor then i have no idea what in userspace could prevent me from accessing it

[17:31:46] <peetaur> hexnewbie: Psi-Jack: FYI on nov 2 we talked about ceph osds dying often and systemd auto restarting them... I had an issue recently where basically EC is just unusably bugged (removing failing osds, deleting the whole pool and restoring backup, etc. always ends up with a few OSDs eating all RAM like >40GB and dying); so now that I got rid of all EC pools, the osds never die.

[21:25:25] <pikapika> going to investigate this later
[21:25:27] <pikapika> Anyways
[21:25:37] <hay207> what do you mean by local password? OS password?
[21:25:40] <root___x86> MaxFury kind of behaviour you want to change?
[21:25:45] <pikapika> New, higher powered laptop. Time to try a higher resolution.
[21:26:34] <MaxFury> hay207 yes, os password
[21:26:39] <HvszrStykp> I got a new SSD on a laptop and I wonder if there is an issue with it. Periodically when there is some IO load, KDE is unable to show and windows and it changes the background to gray, for about 30-90 seconds, and when I switch away to console, I can see that the 'wait' percentage in the top utility is as high as 80-90%. But with my previous SSD I never had any problem like this. Does this sound like
[21:26:46] <HvszrStykp> definitely a problem with the SSD?

[21:28:45] <HvszrStykp> FightingFalcon: You should be able to do it with lsof and restricting to TCP/UDP
[21:28:47] <dka> normally this is without screen plugged, but since I was moving it in and out to plug a screen because sometimes I cannot connect other ssh
