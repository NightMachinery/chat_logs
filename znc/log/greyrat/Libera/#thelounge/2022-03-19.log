[11:56:30] <peetee> Activ8: were you in #hexchat?
[11:57:19] <Activ8> peetee I don't need to justify to someone on here, I dare say the majority is logging and have logs from a long time ago since they come on here and used the lounge 
[11:57:51] <Activ8> I have iggied them now
[12:04:48] <c014> We need a better log management in thelounge
[12:05:15] <bookworm> need is a strong word, but would be nice yes
[12:06:09] <Activ8> one day I may turn logs off completely anyway I have no need for them in reality 
[12:06:26] <bookworm> define logs now?
[12:06:47] <Activ8> scroll back and saved lines of chat
[12:06:50] <bookworm> the sqlite db is "logs" and I'm fairly certain you'd like search and backlog
[12:07:07] <c014> Able to download logs, broken up in dailies like 2022-01-02 etc.. and to browse through it somehow would be awesome
[12:07:10] <Activ8> I don't recall the last time I used it
[12:07:13] <Activ8> tbf
[12:07:31] <bookworm> c014: what for?
[12:07:31] *** Joins: iXNyNe3760 (~NyNe@user/nyne)
[12:07:44] <Activ8> you can do it by a bot if you want too really
[12:07:51] <Activ8> there's logging bots everywhere
[12:08:30] <c014> I have irc logs for like a decade or more.. it's great when you need to go through channel stats, go back and look what we talked about ages ago or when we discussed a subject and so on
[12:08:54] <Activ8> I live in the moment not the past
[12:09:21] <c014> Yeah whatever, I'm not going to go in to this debate, but log management and also management for uploaded files in thelounge would be nice 
[12:09:24] <Activ8> but others obviously don't and that's not for me to say
[12:10:08] <bookworm> the point isn't to arguing but to dee what people would like to see and what the use case is
[12:10:11] <bookworm> see*
[12:11:20] <Activ8> well don't get me wrong logs can be useful 
[12:12:13] <Activ8> if I was to have my own channel I would use a bot so it's centrally logged and not individually logged but people still have that choice if they want to do that
[12:12:35] <Activ8> it's nice and simple the way it is though
[12:13:20] <bookworm> querying a bot in channel is a pretty shitty UX
[12:13:52] <bookworm> as any replay comes from the bot then
[12:14:07] <Activ8> you wouldn't do it in a channel log it outside of a channel and add a search function
[12:14:25] <c014> I don't see why I should use a bot when I am already in the channels, 24/7.. if it's for logs
[12:14:25] <bookworm> I mean I have the backlog module available in znc and that thing is horrid to read the output of
[12:15:51] <Activ8> not saying you have to use a bot, just saying there's other options available
[12:16:01] <Activ8> until it's developed, (IF)
[12:17:11] <Activ8> I have seen external searchable logging enabled before in some channels just can't remember where
[12:17:14] <c014> I am just thankful that this community at least take user suggestions in to consideration

[12:18:07] <Activ8> well yeh 
[12:18:15] <bookworm> I mean our current search is rudimentary but there's no reason this can't be improved 
[12:18:19] <c014> There's another irc project called convos.. some guy there flipped out because I jokingly asked for ident support
[12:18:21] <bookworm> needs a better index
[12:18:36] <Activ8> I'm wondering if there would be any other way to log
[12:19:02] <Activ8> another system maybe of some sort for full set logging with external searches or something
[12:19:23] <bookworm> there's different aspects to logs. One is archiving, two is access your own (search, context etc) and third is public scrollback

[12:19:45] <bookworm> 3 is generally not appreciated by quite a bunch of people 
[12:20:05] <bookworm> some chans do, but then you need to add a disclaimer in the topic
[12:20:19] <c014> I don't know if there's is a way to do it, but in thelounge when I use search, I can search for a word to find the exact conversation I looked for.. but if I want to jump to that conversation as whole.. go back in the log to that place.. is there a way to do that?
[12:20:22] <bookworm> 1) just needs to be something that's low storage
[12:20:38] <bookworm> not yet, planned
[12:20:49] <Activ8> I'm wondering if public scroll back could be a setting of some sort in config.js underneath public/private setting maybe
[12:20:52] <Activ8> that might be an option
[12:20:53] <c014> Ah great.. 
[12:20:54] <bookworm> ideally you could then jump to the surrounding context
[12:21:02] <c014> Exactly
[12:21:30] <bookworm> for that and some other nice things we first need to implement proper ids and that's what I was playing with the other day
