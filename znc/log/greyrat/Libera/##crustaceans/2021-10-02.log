[00:07:44] <manicennui> Took care of two urgent issues this week, neither of which required much effort, but people will be very happy with me for a while.
[00:13:37] <gwozniak> I managed to solve some bug that looked pretty bad, but was actually rather simple.  Just took some investigation
[00:15:50] <gwozniak> Helped that I'm reasonably competent at debugging the compiler.  If I didn't know what I was doing, it would have taken a while
[00:17:42] <gwozniak> Now waiting for some tests to finish before running even more tests and putting it up for review
[00:26:25] <gwozniak> One thing that I have to get better about at work is seeing exactly how to do something and resisting the temptation to do it when it is not assigned to me
[00:29:02] <manicennui> I do a lot of that.
[00:29:25] <manicennui> I could have not gotten involved in the prod issue today.
[00:29:29] <manicennui> They would have figured it out.

[02:27:17] <manicennui> So far the Sopranos prequel seems like a lot of fan service.
[02:27:26] <manicennui> I have a hard time caring about mob shows/movies anymore.
[02:27:44] <manicennui> Couldn't finish the Irishman.
[03:17:20] <companion_cube> manicennui: have  you tried Squid Games?
[03:17:33] <manicennui> companion_cube: No, but it is on my list.
[03:17:40] <manicennui> I have to wait until I can give it my attention.
[03:26:47] <manicennui> What a waste of time.
[03:26:56] <manicennui> I have no idea what the point of this movie is.
[03:30:12] <manicennui> Guess the point was to increase HBO Max subscriptions.
[03:44:24] <dimadima> clicked a cbsnews.com link and ublock has blocked 230 requests
[03:44:40] <dimadima> 33%
[03:44:51] <manicennui> Nice.
[03:45:13] <manicennui> Know what doesn't have that problem?
[03:45:32] <dimadima> lol

[03:46:45] <manicennui> Most people on reddit are negative about The Main Sains of Newark, as are some critics, and most people on Twitter are acting like it is one of the best movies in a while.
[03:46:51] <manicennui> I don't know WTF they watched.
[03:48:36] <manicennui> Apparently the fan service was enough for some people.
[03:49:36] <dimadima> i learned that terms just a few weeks ago, "fan service"
[03:49:38] <dimadima> great term
[03:50:18] <manicennui> It's one of the main Hollywood go tos at this point.
[03:50:31] <manicennui> Do you remember this character?!
[03:50:35] <manicennui> Do you remember this joke?!
[03:50:58] <manicennui> Look, they did that thing that was mentioned in the other movie!
[03:51:07] <dimadima> fwiw maybe it'll get better
[03:51:09] <dimadima> first epsiode
[03:51:16] <manicennui> It's a movie.
[03:51:20] <dimadima> oh lol
[03:51:24] <manicennui> People paid to see it in the theater.
[03:51:31] <manicennui> I would be pretty annoyed if I had.
[03:55:09] <manicennui> I'm sure the Dexter series will be kind of pointless too.
[03:55:35] <manicennui> Gotta make that money with uninspired entertainment!
[04:26:20] <dimadima> my evening has officially begun
[04:26:55] <manicennui> Did you work until almost 9 PM?
[04:27:12] <dimadima> naaa my day is broken up a bunch
[04:27:52] <dimadima> i worked, like... 9:30-11:30, 1:15-3:30, 4-6
[04:28:00] <dimadima> i would say that's realistically what i worked
[04:28:09] <dimadima> minus chat about politics on irc here :)
[04:28:35] <dimadima> just put the child to sleep so now everything is 10x chiller
[04:29:25] <manicennui> Ah.
[04:29:26] <dimadima> one more website graphic and i'll be done with graphics. i did, indeed, use some stock art. thanks again for the suggestion
[04:29:59] <manicennui> Did you use the turds?
[04:31:51] <dimadima> heheh naa i used this https://unsplash.com/photos/sNtKMEsv-_4
[04:32:33] <manicennui> I think I'd enjoy Scotland.
[04:33:15] <dimadima> oh me too. my wife has been and wants to go back. so that's probably where we're going to go when we can
[04:33:27] <dimadima> i've never been to the UK

[04:39:32] <manicennui> I don't really enjoy travel.
[04:40:22] <dimadima> thing i like about travel is seeing all the minor differences. like electrical outlets, door fixtures, window types

[04:42:55] <dimadima> you don't like the mechanics of traveling you mean?
[04:43:40] <manicennui> Among other things.
[04:43:44] <manicennui> I like to nest.
[04:44:00] <manicennui> When I do go somewhere, I like to stay in one spot for a while and live more like locals.
[04:44:16] <dimadima> yeah that's something i'd like to do more
[04:44:22] <dimadima> that's hard to do when you don't live there though
[04:44:40] <manicennui> airbnb
[04:44:44] <dimadima> airbnb/vrbo have made that a lot easier
[04:44:45] <dimadima> jinx
[04:45:13] <dimadima> i went to ukraine like in 2008 for the first time since i came to the states as a 4 year old
[04:45:28] <dimadima> and stayed with some of my mom's friends in a totally normal non-descript suburb
[04:45:32] <dimadima> and that was really cool
[04:45:50] <dimadima> it wasn't touristy per se cause we were .... from there?
[04:46:03] <dimadima> that would be much more difficult anywhere else where you're not from
[04:46:18] <dimadima> got to do that a bit in germany too
[04:49:38] <manicennui> Hopefully Scotland is able to leave the UK and join the EU.

[18:50:48] <manicennui> Square's online ordering is kind of clunky.
[19:02:13] <dimadima> you're ordering something from a page w/ a square integration?
[19:03:56] <manicennui> Yes.
[19:04:06] <manicennui> I assume they use Square as their POS too.
[19:04:21] <manicennui> But the square online stuff does weird things with form validation.
[19:04:34] <manicennui> Sometimes I have to select a field again and tab out to get it to validate.
[19:04:44] <manicennui> And it often clears parts of the form for no apparent reason.
