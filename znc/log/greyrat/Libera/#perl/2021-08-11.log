[00:01:51] <leitz> I know that "lines of code" (LOC) isn't a great measure of much, but managers like it. Is there a documented "standard" where "one developer can maintain X LOC"?
[00:01:55] *** ram_ is now known as ramix
[00:02:19] <leitz> I've seen the number 10,000, but am not sure if it's a shared opinion.
[00:02:50] <ether> attempting to do that between different projects, let alone different languages, sounds unrealistic
[00:04:20] <veesh> Do tests count?
[00:04:45] <veesh> Towards loc?
[00:04:47] <xq> definition of 'maintain' will matter, code quality will matter, test coverage (or I guess more specifically a lack of it) will matter
[00:05:00] <Grinnz> hopefully sloc or cloc, rather than uselessly counting newlines
[00:05:04] <xenu> some codebases need more work than the others
[00:05:19] <xq> application domain will matter (webapp vs custom protocols/formats/etc)
[00:05:21] <El_Che> most managers don't care about maintenance, so are you supposed to add features and big bugs besides the obvious?
[00:05:41] <buu> ha ha tests
[00:05:42] <Grinnz> number of tests vs https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc can be a somewhat useful metric
[00:05:43] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ GitHub - AlDanial/cloc: cloc counts blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code... ]
[00:05:44] <veesh> Do test fixtures count towards loc?
[00:05:54] <xq> level of required reliability will matter (are you checking return values of every print?)
[00:06:06] <leitz> Agreed with all. I don't tend to count tests, but that's just me. 
[00:06:23] <Grinnz> tests aren't functionality, they should be measured *against* the functionality
[00:06:49] <El_Che> If you don't count tests, people will not write tests
[00:06:49] <buu> veesh: they'd better
[00:06:57] <leitz> I'm sort of on the fence about some of the other stuff. 
[00:07:07] <MikeGeorge[m]> Tests require maintenance.
[00:07:11] <veesh> How about generated ddl?
[00:07:15] <buu> If we were measuring a programmer's ability to maintain LOC then test lines should count 2x
[00:07:41] <leitz> I've led the push for testing, and we do test. Lots more than before I got there.
[00:07:46] <buu> dunno
[00:07:55] <buu> testing seems to be like agile
[00:08:29] <MikeGeorge[m]> If you write tests to test your tests, do they count 4x?
[00:09:11] <leitz> El_Che, that's part of the question. I'm trying to explain why adding features and handing external changes takes a lot of time, and that we have bugs to fix as well.
[00:09:23] <MikeGeorge[m]> If you write your strings in hexadecimal, do they count 0x?
[00:09:44] <leitz> MikeGeorge[m], that's pretty funny...
[00:10:11] <El_Che> I see it with our java devs. They are good, but updating libraries is a problem because that type of maintenance is not counted
[00:11:07] <El_Che> so after a while you end up with old/broken/insecured dependencies and updates need a lot of time not to break stuff. So all the "winning" from no-maintenance is lost.
[00:12:44] <Grinnz> yeah, why i am very glad to be in a job that measures results rather than code
[00:14:14] <veesh> my $work code is ~ 16k lines of perl (it's certainly more) and i've got it quite under control
[00:14:40] <veesh> using cloc
[00:15:50] <veesh> ~10k lines of tests in total
[00:15:59] <veesh> but i get measured in results
[00:16:14] <leitz> Grinnz, I am where I am. I've tried to keep up with other languages, but my brain just doesn't have the capacity for doing "half way decent" in more than one. So I do Perl at home, since I do Perl at work.
[00:17:07] <vague> Does cloc count words per line also? especially with perl it's easy to extend LOC by adding linebreaks in strategic places :)
[00:17:34] <veesh> also 12k lines of frontend vue.js code

[15:18:18] <ehuelsmann[m]> morning. I'm walking a perl structure of hashrefs and arrayrefs; I want to modify some of the leaf values (scalars). Can I do that in-place?

[15:20:58] <LeoNerd> suer
[15:22:00] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. I'll paste the code I was using in a sec, because debug prints were showing replacements, but the actual input value was printed unchanged.
[15:26:31] <perlbot> Anonymous pasted a new file at https://l.perl.bot/p/1dc346 - 
[15:26:41] <ehuelsmann[m]> oh. that's mine.
[15:27:50] <shlomif> ehuelsmann[m]: $aref= [@new] may be different than @$aref= @new
[15:28:22] <LeoNerd> Probably the easiest way is to recurse on scalar refs to the various items
[15:28:45] <LeoNerd> Recurse down to  \$aref->[$idx]  or \$href->{$key}  so in the recursed function, new leaf values can be written by  $$ref = "new value"

[18:07:10] <alh> At a guess - you typed curl https://localhost:5000 instead of curl http://localhost:5000 ?
[18:07:44] <alh> (Alternatively, something else is already listening on localhost:5000 and plackup is starting your server on a different port?)
[18:07:45] <Mandevil> No, I didn't.
[18:08:05] <alh> Alternatively: The psgi app is somehow running an SSL server
[18:08:10] <Mandevil> I run the script as CGI through Apache
[18:08:57] <alh> Ah, well, if you ran the script directly with plackup on its own you could test as I said
[18:09:01] <alh> With however you've configured apache - good luck
[18:09:08] <Mandevil> The idea was to bypass the whole web server.
[18:10:09] <alh> Yes. "plackup foo.psgi" will start a local testable webserver on 0.0.0.0:5000 that you can hit directly with curl/telnet/whatever 
[18:10:53] <Mandevil> Before I plackerized the script I had it written in a way that it actually was able to take params from argv
[18:11:09] <Mandevil> So it used commandline args just like URL params or POST params.
[18:11:18] <Mandevil> And I could test stuff right on the command line.
[18:11:25] <Mandevil> Without any HTTP going on anywhere.
[18:11:37] <alh> You could write such a wrapper using LWP::Protocol::PSGI and LWP::UserAgent
[18:11:42] <Altreus> Mandevil: I use httpie
[18:11:48] <Mandevil> Altreus: So do I!
[18:11:51] <Altreus> ah!
[18:11:55] <Mandevil> It's giving me the SSL problem as well.
[18:12:06] <Mandevil> And the local plackup webserver won't help me.
[18:12:10] <alh> Why not?
[18:12:15] <Altreus> oh I was still answering the how to encode the data question :)
[18:12:21] <Mandevil> The server is behind a firewall that won't let me reach it at tcp/5000 or whatever.
[18:12:32] <alh> If you can run plackup on that server...
[18:12:39] <alh> Then in another shell on that server you can use curl against localhost
[18:12:46] <alh> Unles that firewall is configured really insane 
[18:12:47] <Altreus> Do you need to hit that server or can you do the tests locally?
[18:12:50] <Mandevil> Oh right, I can do that, true.
[18:13:06] <Mandevil> Still, why can't I just run the script and pass it args on commandline?
[18:13:11] <alh> Because that's not how plack works?
[18:13:24] <Mandevil> Well, I guess.
[18:14:13] <Altreus> Can I suggest that you have done one refactor too few
[18:14:30] <Mandevil> My head is exploding from all the refactoring :)
[18:14:37] <Altreus> What you want to do now is put the behaviour in modules, and have a plack script and a command-line script that both use them
[18:14:50] <Altreus> of course - this is the nature of modernising code
[18:14:53] <Altreus> heads will splode
[18:15:19] <Mandevil> Personally, when I get on with updating the web app backend, I'll just rewrite it with Mojolicious
[18:15:20] <Altreus> That's why my first goal is to get something I can test locally - which plack should be good at

[20:49:31] <The_Blode_> IO::Async looks like it might do the trick thanks a lot :)
[20:51:21] <mst> would need more information to give detailed async advice
[20:51:37] <The_Blode_> Here's one scenario as an example.
[20:53:21] <The_Blode_> Hmm. I'll give you the actual scenario.
[20:53:26] <The_Blode_> It will make more sense.
[20:53:48] <The_Blode_> I want to play a file via a module AGI::Asterisk
[20:53:57] <The_Blode_> And I want to use the stream_file method.
[20:54:23] <The_Blode_> I want to call another method that executes 5 seconds after the stream_file method is called
[20:54:55] <The_Blode_> Apologies if that's not clear.
[20:56:19] <Grinnz> note that two pieces of code can't run at the same time unless you use forking or threading (but threading is slow and more difficult)
[20:56:40] <The_Blode_> Oh
[20:56:58] <Grinnz> since you're already looking at IO::Async, look at IO::Async::Function which abstracts parallel execution
[20:57:11] <The_Blode_> Thank you Grinnz

[22:32:25] <OnlineCop> Well, if I find what I consider a bug in PCRE, and trace it back to what looks like a bug in perl's regex, then should I report it as a bug?
[22:32:47] <mst> I don't actually give a shit what you do about PCRE
[22:32:59] <mst> but you're welcome to discuss whether the behaviour in perl is a bug or not here
[22:33:06] <mst> just remember they're nothing to do with us and we don't care
[22:33:18] <Grinnz> "trace it back" might be a confusing step there, given that the PCRE engine is a C library that has nothing to do with how perl regex works
[22:33:34] <Grinnz> they historically have very different bugs
[22:33:45] <mst> right, it doesn't actually make sense as a sentence, but I'm just going to add that to the list of things I already announced I don't care about
[22:34:26] <OnlineCop> Would you consider that ^^ exim bug report to actually be a bug in perl?
[22:34:29] <Grinnz> they are similar in syntax obviously, and in that they both operate in order with backtracking

[22:37:02] <Grinnz> i think the definition of "works" there is questionable but i don't understand these esoteric operators enough
[22:37:48] <OnlineCop> In this example, it works in perl and not PCRE. But Hazel's argument is that (*ACCEPT) stays within subroutine calls (I'm not sure exactly how that applies to (*SKIP) or (*F) but it might... /shrug).
[22:38:17] <OnlineCop> I'm just trying to build a valid argument as to why I believe PCRE2 should "fix" this to match perl's behaviour.
[22:41:11] <mst> realistically, you've got sufficiently complicated there that my answer would be "I probably wouldn't try and do that in a single regexp anyway"

[23:50:50] <control> one more thing please, im trying to get content from form name
[23:50:54] <control> $mech->save_content("$number.txt" => format => 'text' => form_name => 'fullcredits_content');
[23:51:03] <control> is it the right syntax?
[23:55:44] <Adura> Lacks some , for readability...?
[23:56:13] <mst> I don't see wnything about form_name as a content() argument?
[23:57:10] <mst> you seem to be doing something completely different to the last question?
[23:58:44] <control> yes i want to get content from specified form name
