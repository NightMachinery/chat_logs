[01:26:50] <libsys> shouldn't C be available on every system?
[01:27:06] <earnestly> Yes
[01:27:23] <earnestly> But then you lose UTF-8 (musl is different here)
[01:27:46] <earnestly> glibc recently added C.UTF-8
[01:28:18] <earnestly> Often it's enough to use C on a per-command basis as needed

[04:13:02] <kurahaupo> earnestly: FYI you don't need to insert backslashes when dealing with SQL: standard SQL has "quote stuffing": to include a single quote inside a string, you just repeat it, e.g. « 'Don''t worry, quotes within quoted strings aren''t a problem.' ». (IMO this is more sensible than the C backslashing approach, because it means that quote marks are ALWAYS paired, so code management tools don't need to replicate the complexity of a full

[05:53:55] <bn_work> it's difficult to explain, we have a setup script, it assumes root's umask is 0022 but on some systems this isn't the case, so would like to ensure it is set to 0022 while the setup script(s) run

[05:59:45] <greycat> It affects the *script*.  You said that's what you wanted.
[06:01:08] <greycat> Now you seem to be saying that the script is what calls sudo, not the human running "sudo setup-script".  Are you claiming that sudo, which is run in the middle of the script, is *changing* the umask?

[11:47:10] <emanuele6> at least in bash, there is no difference between defining a function with or without `function'. but `function foo () { ... }' can be used to define a function named "foo" if there is an alias named "foo". `foo () { ... }' would expand foo if foo was an alias.

[19:07:32] <cryptonector> PapaChub: you might think the last one should produce a different pid because the bash in the echo should be a child of the sub-shell running echo, but there's no reason it should be so
[19:08:21] <cryptonector> first, echo is a built-in, so there's that, but also, bash could make every fork happen at the top-level and then place each child into the correct process group and connect it to the correct pipes for I/O as needed

[19:35:36] <PapaChub> cryptonector, For better or for worse, it's exactly that "sunken cost" the built-up years of edge-conditions and corner-cases that makes me stick with bash, versus experimenting with zsh, fish, etc.

[19:37:52] <greybot> foo && bar || baz is not equivalent to 'if foo; then bar; else baz; fi'. In the former case, baz will happen if *either* foo *or* bar return false. In the latter case, baz will only trigger if foo returns false, regardless of the exit code for bar. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashPitfalls

[19:38:49] <cryptonector> PapaChub: but... how would any other shell do better??  seriously, in a pipeline where some of the commands are function calls, only one of them could possibly be evaluated in the top-level shell without introducing a lot a issues around shared state mutation -- this is NOT specifically about Bash but generic to all shells that mutate state
[19:39:19] <cryptonector> e.g., this happens in ksh too -- idk about zsh, but I very strongly suspect the same thing for the same reasons
[19:40:13] <cryptonector> if you had a shell built around immutability (think, like a shell built around jq), then you'd automatically solve this problem, but not in the way that you wanted...
[19:42:08] <PapaChub> "dwimsh" would always do what I mean...  ;-D
[19:43:04] <cryptonector> i.e., if functions couldn't alter global state, then some_funcA | some_funcB | ... could totally be implemented with the top-level shell evaluationg all function calls in that pipeline, but then, you specifically wanted your findStuff() to mutate global state, which means that wouldn't work for you

[22:20:51] <The_Jag> Hi, I need a little bit of help regarding sed: I have a script in which I launch sed to substitute some values in a template (@@abcd@@) with a corresponding variable ${abcd}.
[22:21:16] <The_Jag> the sed command is this: sed -i '' -e "s|@@\([^ ]*\)@@|${\1}|g" ${FILE}
[22:21:46] <The_Jag> It exits with the error "Bad substitution". where am I wrong?

[22:22:15] <emg> the order of substitutions from shell and sed don't intermingle that way
[22:22:42] <emg> the bash expensions happen first before sed ever sees the arguments
[22:22:56] <emg> the bad substitution is from bash

[22:23:39] <The_Jag> ow :(
[22:24:06] <The_Jag> How can I fix this? Is it fixable?
[22:24:42] <emg> it would be much easier to know the variables beforehand, build up an argument array, and use it (probably with m4 I'd think)
[22:25:33] <emg> e.g.    args(-D@@abcd@@="$abcd" -D@@foo@@="$foo" ...); m4 "$args" templatefile > newfile

[22:28:18] <userdocs> this looks like a bash parameter but with a sed regex ${} \1
