[01:10:21] <plujon> However, if I drag a terminal window around my desktop, there is no flicker.

[01:19:34] <plujon> On this same hardware, I used to use openbox (lubuntu).  I never saw this same behavior then.  Hmm.  I'll look into trying wayland, I guess.
[01:20:01] <plujon> It definitely looks like the areas of the screen that are supposed to "update" are the problem.
[01:20:49] <plujon> Would that point to the compositor?  I don't have a good grasp on how stuff actually gets drawn on the monitor.

[01:22:07] <plujon> I wonder why X11 is the default on ubuntu 20.04.
[01:22:44] <quadrat> plujon because canonical was not comfortable to support wayland for 10 years on a 20.04 base
[01:22:48] <soreau> plujon: it's hard to say where the problem is actually, but it is most likely either kernel, mesa or window manager
[01:22:55] <sarnold> we tried switching to wayland for an earlier release and it did not go great
[01:22:59] <oerheks> there is never a huge change with LTS, like wayland
[01:23:13] <soreau> wayland is simply not ready for desktop production use yet
[01:23:18] <sarnold> nvidia drivers still don't work with wayland, so it feels unlikely to ever be a default to me, but that's a guess
[01:23:21] <soreau> but it's getting there, slowly
[01:23:44] <oerheks> not ready .. that is why you have a x11 session installed too
[01:23:45] <quadrat> sarnold oO nvidia supports wayland, but no xwayland, which is fixed in the 470 drivers
[01:23:50] <soreau> in the mean time, users can test it and report bugs
[01:24:34] <plujon> Are there any logs I should check other than dmesg?  Or would the current bug not be something likely to be logged?

[11:22:38] <ruedii> In that case, just set the MOTD to be blank.
[11:23:41] <ruedii> That way it will update it to be blank.    I know running a useless script seems unusual, but it makes more sense than ripping out a primary function, and you never know when you might need to add an MOTD back.
[11:24:22] *** Quits: katnip (yarddogg@user/yarddogg) (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:24:24] <Guest914> Is there a singular process that runs all those scripts?

[11:24:58] *** Joins: katnip (yarddogg@user/yarddogg)
[11:25:06] <ruedii> The update motd script runs in almost no time.
[11:25:46] <ruedii> BTW, if you want a custom MOTD, there are some seriously cool things you can do with it.  It parses all sorts of variables about the current state of your system, and you can set it to either parse on boot or on display.

[11:27:33] <ruedii> Just be careful, a few UTF extended characters have minor issues with terminals not set to UTF-8.
[11:28:23] <ruedii> I think Ubuntu needs to move the default advanced VT to use UTF8 now that there are options available and all video cards that are the slightest bit modern are capable of it on a hardware level.

[11:29:03] <ruedii> An 8 bit per a glyph framebuffer actually runs slower on some newer cards which are optimized for 16bit and 32bit access partitioning.
[11:29:38] <rfm> Guest914, if you just want to stop diplaying the motd at login, you want to comment out the pam_motd lines in //etc/pam.d/{login,sshd}
[11:30:24] <ruedii> rfm, yep. that is an excelent way to do it too.
[11:31:10] <ruedii> I need to look into my video card issue further and get back.  I hope it's not the same one I was running into earlier on Ubuntu 20.04 (SMU crashing on DPM initializing.)
[11:31:23] <rfm> Guest914,  if you want to climb back further, there's motd-news.service and update-notifier-motd.service (both on timers() at least, and there might be more...
[11:32:37] *** Joins: _del (~del@s01061cabc0a61713.ed.shawcable.net)
[11:32:48] <ruedii> There is also a whole infrastructure for setting all sorts of neat stuff on MOTD.  For instance, you can check the current system load average, and available memory.
[11:33:28] <ruedii> Note that there are tricky little syntax distinctions between parse at runtime, parse at initial set, and parse at boot.

[11:57:42] <alzgh> ayrus it's about how to interpret it. `man sudo` show the following for the `-i, --login` switch: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/D3JZqgb3rN/. I use this switch to go into root since root is not enabled on my system (ubuntu focal), but as hard as I try I can't see this in the text of the man page.

[12:00:09] <alzgh> OK, sorry. Let me rephrase.
[12:00:16] <EriC^^> alzgh: if you type 'man sudo' then type '/-i' and hit enter twice does it not display it?
[12:00:20] *** Joins: dan86 (~Daniel@user/dan86)
[12:00:45] <EriC^^> *hit "n" once
[12:02:14] <alzgh> I know that `sudo -i` let's me login as the super user. I found this out through means other then the man page (I used `tldr` and google). Then I went to read the sudo man page and looked at it's description for `-i, --login` and didn't find any reference to the fact that this switch helps you login as the super user.
[12:02:18] <ayrus> alzgh: it's the `vim`.
[12:02:37] <alzgh> I know how to search in the man pages.
[12:03:09] <alzgh> My question is, how should I learn from this https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/D3JZqgb3rN/ that the `-i, --login` switch enables me to login as the super user.
[12:03:27] <alzgh> What am I missing there?
[12:03:30] <alzgh> In the man page.
[12:03:40] <sneep> Maybe you should be more interested in what Ubuntu means by "disabling the root user"
[12:03:46] <sneep> +instead
[12:04:23] <ayrus> alzgh: are you mentioning there is no entry for `-i` in the man page of sudo?
[12:04:40] <Croran> alzgh: sudo gives you the permissions of the super user. why wouldn't you think this extends to logging in as the super user?
[12:04:57] <alzgh> sneep maybe that's the root of my confusion. If I knew what it meant under the hood, maybe I would how the description of this switch worked.
[12:05:15] <sneep> Well, if you run sudo bash, do you get a root shell? Yes
[12:06:14] <Croran> alzgh: easier to 'sudo su' to get a root shell though.
[12:06:19] <EriC^^> alzgh: in the sudo manpage there's a part where it says if no user is provided it defaults to executing the command as root, and that -i part pertains to the login part where it will execute the command as if you logged in, changes $HOME etc

[12:07:05] <EriC^^> (user is provided via the -u argument)
[12:07:40] <sneep> Ubuntu doesn't set a password for the root user, thereby disabling authenticating as root in the standard login process
[12:08:09] <alzgh> EriC^^ I think that clears things up. I was missing this part. the `-i` switch is just for loading the selected users preferences.
[12:08:34] <ducasse> alzgh: are you saying you can't see the definition for -1 in the man page?
[12:09:09] <EriC^^> yeah exactly, just so you access the shell as if it were a login shell
[12:09:19] <alzgh> I can see the definition, I wasn't able to understand it though. Was not able to make a logical connection between the text in the man page and how the tool worked.

[12:51:31] <cxl> Hi, I am using grub on my computer. It's a laptop so I have my linux install on the whole internal disk using zfs. But I also have a windows installed on a usb drive and I'd like to add that option in grub instead of having to mash F12 every time I need windows. What's the right way? I took a look at /boot/grub.cfg and it says DO NOT EDIT
[12:52:42] <EriC^^> cxl: you can edit /etc/grub.d/40_custom and add a windows entry there, then 'sudo update-grub' to make a new grub.cfg
[12:52:47] *** Joins: dust (~dust@user/dust)
[12:53:01] <cxl> EriC^^: thank you I'll look there
[12:53:11] <EriC^^> cxl: no problem
[12:54:00] <alkisg> cxl: you can probably just run `update-grub` while you have the stick attached

[12:59:49] <cxl> alkisg: I spoke too fast... it found it according to the command's output, I can see the new entry in /boot/grub/grub.cfg, but when grub actually loads then it's not on the list
[13:00:24] <alkisg> cxl: that might mean it's using a different grub.cfg from elsewhere?
[13:00:32] <alkisg> Press "c" to get a console in grub
[13:00:55] <alkisg> Then set root=(hd0,gpt1) or something, to get to where your grub.cfg is,
[13:01:01] <alkisg> then: configfile /boot/grub/grub.cfg
[13:01:22] <alkisg> If THAT one shows the entry, then go back and echo root etc to see where your initial grub.cfg actually is
[13:01:44] <cxl> ok I'll try that now

[21:46:00] <Hornet> last entry in there about booting I think
[21:46:19] <leftyfb> ezakimak: you are running a modified version of ubuntu. The modification specifically being networking. I don't think we can support that here. Please contact your vendor for support.
[21:46:46] <ezakimak> cause you don't use network manager?
[21:46:53] <ezakimak> and you don't use systemd?
[21:47:03] <ezakimak> you can't tell me how to get log files out of it for an error message?
[21:47:09] <leftyfb> ezakimak: because your vendor removed netplan and who knows what other modifications
[21:47:23] <ezakimak> they claim it never had netplan to begin with
[21:47:24] <ogra`> Hornet, well, not sure where the last two options come from, the rest looks like a proper kernel cmdline
[21:47:34] <ezakimak> all netplan does is create config files
[21:47:46] <ezakimak> so how do you debug when that goes south?
[21:47:51] <Hornet> look at the date though - it's jun 13th. that hasn't been written to in ages
[21:48:04] <Hornet> certainly  not today's boot
[21:48:12] <ogra`> yeah, right

[23:20:20] <oerheks> morgans, standard in ~/Pictures

[23:20:28] <morgans> let me look again.

[23:21:31] <Mekaneck> If you googled it for real you'd know it: By default, Cheese saves the photos and videos in the Webcam folder in your user's Photo or Videos folder of your home folder.
[23:21:54] <morgans> DOH. In the "Webcam" folder. Thanks for being kind to the dumb. (And would help some of us in some Ubuntu help page.)
[23:22:08] <morgans> Thanks oerheks
[23:22:27] <Mekaneck> my next answer was ~/Pictures/Webcam
[23:22:29] <Mekaneck> :)
[23:24:14] <Hornet> ogra` , tomreyn : looks like that has it writing again
[23:24:41] <Hornet> took a long time to boot up to sshable though, when I had it on monitor it was running disk checks
[23:24:42] *** Joins: ax562 (~ax562@user/ax562)
[23:25:01] <tomreyn> Hornet: congrats. and: hush, release upgrade time
[23:25:10] <Hornet> unsure if it should be doing that each boot but who knows, problem for another time! next step is upgrading yes
[23:25:28] <Hornet> is there likely to be anything complex about an upgrade from this old?
[23:25:29] <tomreyn> it probably needed to check all file systems during this boot
[23:25:43] *** Quits: yarra (~yarra@95.70.146.23) (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
[23:25:55] <Hornet> last boot was the same except no networking (no cable that reaches here)
[23:26:11] <Hornet> time taken implies it did the same checks

[23:26:24] <Hornet> it's now back in the corner by the router
[23:26:25] <tomreyn> make sure you have internet access so you can bring it up to date on 16.04
[23:26:42] *** Joins: ax562 (~ax562@user/ax562)
[23:27:21] <tomreyn> then disable all third party repositories, then sudo apt update, then check what you need to remove or downgrade, yet: what does this output? apt list --installed | grep ',local\]$' | nc termbin.com 9999
[23:27:48] <Hornet> hrmmmm, apt can't lock
[23:28:17] <tomreyn> maybe you have unattended-upgrades installed

[23:29:27] <tomreyn> finally, when this and anything around apt updates + apt full-upgrade  looks sound, you can do the release upgrade
[23:29:57] <tomreyn> (after ensuring complete and restorable backups are present)
