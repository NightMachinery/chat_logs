[12:20:16] <epony> you learned that BSD exists and portability is more important for software you plan to keep maintaining
[12:21:45] <epony> it is also recommended to develop on a BSD system like OpenBSD that includes more tooling for correct programming and better know-how for the developer as a whole..
[12:22:43] <epony> GNUism is a common fallacy of packaging software and many people are unaware of portability and reliability concerns for their software releases
[12:23:17] <epony> the GNU projects work well on BSD systems and vice versa, for the most parts that are not "system" specific
[12:23:20] <labrador> epony, portability doesn't matter

[12:28:24] <DiffieHellman> ln: "*nix"? According to pattern matching, that matches Unix, Linux, GNU/Linux and many more - even though those things have no relation.
[12:28:53] <DiffieHellman> GNU's not Unix after all.
[12:29:03] <epony> the are actually related, a family of operating systems and runtime environments
[12:29:10] <epony> it is though ;-)
[12:30:02] <epony> despite the pun, it is a descendant of UNIX and implements a minimal Unix-like system and extends it further with a set of non-conventional choices that became its own convention / style etc
[12:30:37] <labrador> epony, we just had a debate on this at #fsf...don't trigger DiffieHellman again lmao
[12:31:18] <epony> why not, his opinion could be better than yours with regards to "one system" fashion zealotry

[12:31:40] <labrador> We try to do EEE as well
[12:32:04] <labrador> The companies locked into bash cause bash scripts will use it for a long time
[12:32:20] <labrador> IF a bug comes up which noone solves...they will pay for it
[12:32:32] <epony> we can't easily dismiss peole, opinions, ideas, concepts, standards, methodologies
[12:32:42] <labrador> Its better for everyone to get lockin to free software

[12:34:17] <ln> DiffieHellman: despite your relucatence to accept it, GNU makefiles are mostly compatible only with GNU make, i.e. they are proprietary
[12:34:27] <labrador> ln, its not proprietary
[12:34:42] <epony> you see China locked-in and turned inwards and stagnated in innovation and technology for religious and aesthetic and belief systems, which lead to.. it being backwardly and conquered
[12:34:45] <DiffieHellman> 3>Confusing proprietary with not going out of your way to be compatible.
[12:34:50] <labrador> The source code is there do whatever you want to change it to accept your make files
[12:35:06] <ln> labrador: true, not in all senses, but in some.
[12:35:20] <DiffieHellman> GNU adds its own extensions, but the source is there for usage if you can accept the license and you can also implement the featuring without using the source.
[12:35:23] <epony> it's not "product" placement on the market of "free software"
[12:35:28] <epony> IT IS WRONG.
[12:35:34] <labrador> epony, its not product placement
[12:35:37] <labrador> Its domination
[12:35:50] <labrador> It is right
[12:35:58] <DiffieHellman> Proprietary software doesn't give you any source, and often locks the extensions behind patents
[12:36:14] <epony> try to push those ideas to pop-culture ;-) software authors in the free world are more academic and educated people
[12:36:32] <labrador> epony, they will also agree domination is the way to success
[12:36:39] <epony> no, your opinion, labby, is wrong and obsolete
[12:36:43] <labrador> Once you're locked in you can sit back and relax
[12:36:50] <labrador> The companies do the work
[12:36:51] <DiffieHellman> As the code to implmement the extensions is provided and implementing the extensions yourself separately is permitted, that's neither lock-in, no proprietary software, just more features.
[12:36:53] <labrador> Like on linux
[12:36:59] <labrador> Its the best form of lockin
[12:37:08] <labrador> Cannot change your kernels easily at all

[12:37:33] <labrador> And its right too

[12:38:14] <epony> labrador, note, I do not need you to tell those things, you're self assuring yourself someone needs to hear them from you, but that's also incorrect
[12:38:30] <labrador> epony, I'm giving you examples that prove its correct

[12:38:53] <labrador> ok
[12:39:33] <labrador> AwesomeAdam54321, any user gets a copy of the source

[12:40:33] <labrador> lmao wtf how is this fascism
[12:40:37] <AwesomeAdam54321> labrador: But if it refuses to use your modified version, then it doesn't do anything, it's Tivoisation
[12:40:59] <labrador> AwesomeAdam54321, gplv3 denies the ability to tivoise
[12:41:08] <labrador> The only sad thing is linux is gplv2
[12:41:22] <AwesomeAdam54321> That's right, I'm sad that linux is GPLv2-only
[12:41:49] <AwesomeAdam54321> some of the drivers can be licensed GPLv3-or-later but not all
[12:41:50] <epony> labrador, there are more than one system and more than one licensing model, and GNU lists these on their own pages, read a bit more before screaming absolutisms in public.. you're having deficits in your statements
[12:42:04] <labrador> hahaha
[12:42:11] <labrador> ok but your argument is lost

[12:43:45] <labrador> epony, sure but thats not an argument at all...you never proved why your system works better

[13:06:20] <labrador> epony, u disagreed
[13:06:27] <labrador> DiffieHellman, well technically true
[13:06:28] <labrador> EE
[13:06:38] <epony> I made the claim that potability is paramount and very important, and it is called standardisation in prolonged practice.
[13:06:48] <labrador> The extinguishing just happens cause everybody starts using the superior product
[13:06:55] <labrador> Not deliberate
[13:07:07] <DiffieHellman> That's ceassation of use of proprieatry malware, not extinguishing

[13:20:13] <epony> "xenophobic marketing" of GNUism..
[13:20:31] <epony> from a person that is not representing GNU or the better part of GNU's ideas
[13:21:22] <Andrew> GNU doesn't care much about portability, true, but not an ethical issue.
[13:22:46] <ln> Andrew: proprietary (in the context of file format): designed by an organization for a product of their own -- not based on any external standard or spec. a written spec may not exist.
[13:22:53] <Andrew> Portability is useful, I agree!  But it's minor.  If I implement some new Lisp-like operating system or whatever, and there's the choice of making it 03intact and consistent00 vs 03compatible with UNIX-like systems00, I'd choose the former 
[13:22:57] <epony> if you don't fix wrong opinions, they grow and you get outsiders to tell you qualifications you do not expect but wake you up.
[13:24:41] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: I agree that you can't extinguish stuff in the field of free software, but yes you can make things obsolete.
[13:25:00] <Andrew> labrador: superior "product"
[13:25:48] <Andrew> epony: What gived you the thought that DiffieHellman thinks perse is more special than anyone else?
[13:26:05] <Andrew> epony: They'll steal it?  Fun, read the GPL.
[13:26:55] <epony> in reality, every software is getting stolen and reverse engineered if it has value and secrecy to it that would be an advantage to the other side, that's what commerce do with other commercial software
[13:27:06] <Andrew> > 03the US legal system is corrupt and operates with money, not with rights and ethics00 currently, yes, so we face it and sacrifice our values, or we campaign against this corrupt system?
[13:27:28] <epony> why do you think GNU is high quality and would be the object of just taking without honouring the license? because it is what commerce does, it steals
[13:27:46] <epony> but that does not mean GNU software is high quality or worth stealing
[13:27:56] <Andrew> epony: I don't claim there's only one system.  GNU might have claimed that somewhere, I think the Church of Emacs, and I do disagree with that.
[13:28:04] <Andrew> epony: I use OpenBSD day-to-day :)

[13:28:57] <Andrew> epony: I was reading the backlog from the start and catching up
[13:29:05] <epony> GNU is alright, a bit less free than it could be, and a bit more restrictive and protective and enforcing (without being able to enforce anything, just restricting cooperation with other free software vendors) but that's GNU's choices

[13:30:22] <epony> but not the only or the one system to survive, other systems exist, based on their historic precedence which were and still are more free and more open and even better quality
[13:30:26] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: epony means intercompatibility with BSD and stuff
[13:30:41] <Andrew> Anyways, with a free system, it's absolutely okay and not that hard to write compatible software on other platforms
[13:30:44] <Andrew> Off to dinner
[13:30:48] <epony> of course, the two main models of software are BSD and later GNU
[13:30:51] <DiffieHellman> Many BSD's kinda rely on GNU in some part you know? I.e. OpenBSD
[13:30:58] <Andrew> DiffieHellman: Yup
[13:31:06] <epony> that reliance is declining
[13:31:09] <Andrew> i.e. GNU Info is preinstalled iirc
[13:31:23] <epony> because GNU does not compete with quality, but with policy and beliefs
[13:31:28] <Andrew> epony: I think that's good, because BSD's technical philosophy isn't inline with GNU

[15:02:41] <epony> note, GNU is not included as it is a re-implementation (derivative) of the Research UNIX
[15:03:04] <epony> or just plain BSD UNIX
[15:03:19] <epony> but only the userland and utilities
[15:03:21] <Andrew> I agree with "re-implementation", you could argue what derivative means though
[15:03:45] <Andrew> Linux is a UNIX-like system?
[15:03:50] *** Quits: belgin (~belgin@5-12-77-45.residential.rdsnet.ro) (Quit: Leaving)
[15:03:52] <epony> of course
[15:04:05] <epony> Linux is a Minix-like system, which is Unix-like system
[15:04:16] <AwesomeAdam54321> Andrew: For me, derivative means modified from the source code
[15:04:19] <epony> majority of Linux are SysV derived systems
[15:04:20] * Andrew doesn't understand
[15:04:24] * Andrew aagrees with AwesomeAdam54321
[15:04:34] <Andrew> i.e. Parabola is a derivative of Arch
[15:04:36] <AwesomeAdam54321> epony: Linux is a kernel
[15:04:43] <epony> no, derived means from the "interfaces" of the system, nothing to do with "source code"
[15:05:03] <epony> and GNU is not a kernel, hence is not on the list of operating systems
[15:05:15] <Andrew> What?
[15:05:19] * Andrew is confused
[15:05:21] <epony> yep
[15:05:24] <AwesomeAdam54321> epony: then it's "interface-compatible"
[15:05:27] <Andrew> Similarly, macOS isn't a kernel, XNU is a kernel
[15:05:41] <epony> MacOS is not on the list of UNIX systems
[15:05:57] <epony> as it's not a UNIX kernel
[15:06:12] <epony> that is similar for Minix, not a UNIX system
[15:06:15] <Andrew> "Mac OS X, OS X, macOS 10.0 to 10.15..."
[15:06:25] <Andrew> It's on the diagram though
[15:06:34] <labrador> Andrew, mbsync
[15:06:34] <epony> yeah, it got the FreeBSD userland
[15:06:35] <Andrew> And why do you think UNIX system == kernel?
[15:06:49] <Andrew> labrador: I did
[15:06:51] <epony> cause kernels have specific features that make the system one or another
[15:06:58] <epony> like process management and organisation of the kernel
[15:07:02] <epony> which set systems apart
[15:07:06] <Andrew> Oops, used reply instead of reply-all
[15:07:11] <AwesomeAdam54321> It would be strange if the diagram referred to kernels, it should be about the operating system as a whole
[15:07:11] <epony> not "the seller" or the "marketing name"
[15:07:28] <epony> yeah, it's wrong to consider systems a marketing term
[15:07:39] <epony> a system is a set of conventions and standards
[15:07:52] <epony> so de-facto GNU is a UNIX system despite no being on the map
[15:08:00] <labrador> I sent email right now Andrew...earlier mbsync don't count
[15:08:05] <Andrew> Oh
[15:08:06] <epony> cause it follows the userland implementation of UNIX
[15:08:11] <Andrew> No new emails
[15:08:14] <labrador> oh

[15:09:46] <Andrew> o/ isf
[15:10:09] <epony> so technically systems are much more importantly classified as implementation conventions and standards, than "branding" and "reseller"
[15:10:11] <labrador> oh hey isf 
[15:10:19] <labrador> I was talking about you in email
[15:10:23] <labrador> Check it out
[15:10:42] <epony> that's why distributors do not matter much, but the authoring research groups and their work, and the conventions and standards matter everything
[15:10:48] <Andrew> Yeah, i'll check his records
[15:12:26] <Andrew> both isf and GNUHacker's email service don't have proper DKIMs
[15:12:58] <Andrew> (The client doesn't get to read dmarc or spf, I'm too lazy to go to my server)

[15:13:43] <labrador> even tho they use the same server
[15:13:50] <isf> hello
[15:13:52] <epony> but really the UNIX systems are just two types
[15:14:00] <isf> i want leave the gruup labrador
[15:14:04] <isf> and the mail list
[15:14:12] <Andrew> Wait, they use the same server?
[15:14:23] <Andrew> Oh, easy
[15:14:23] <isf> i dont have the same provider mail
[15:14:28] <isf> as gnuhacker
[15:14:30] <isf> him have riseup
[15:14:31] <Andrew> They're sending from member.fsf.org, which uses aliases
[15:14:40] <Andrew> isf: No, labrador uses riseup, GNUHacker doesn't
[15:14:44] <epony> BSD and SYSV, both UNIX-like descendants, some of which are more UNIX-like others less, none of them UNIX except the BSD UNIX which is a direct continuation of the BSD / Research UNIX releases
[15:14:48] <isf> yes gnuhacker use riseup
[15:14:50] <isf> believe me
[15:14:51] <isf> xd
[15:14:52] <Andrew> You should receive mail on member.fsf.org, don't send mail with that
[15:14:54] <Andrew> isf: Hmm
[15:15:05] <isf> is just a alias the member.fsf.org for the fsf members
[15:15:08] <epony> so those are the two conventions, and GNU is an implementer of the SYSV convention
[15:15:42] <epony> and since GNU took over more of the free software development than commercial vendors, it is respected more and honoured as a GNU convention

[15:16:28] <epony> with its peculiarities of lower portability for excess of features, long options, non-semantic documentation (missing technical details) and such.. commercial like fallacies
[15:16:31] <Andrew> Because it's just an alias, you shouldn't set your From address to the FSF address
[15:16:32] <isf> irc works fine, the gpg must work, but for important issues
[15:16:44] <Andrew> ?
[15:17:04] <isf> i want leave the group and mail list if u make me part of it other make me part of it
[15:17:14] <isf> becouse, i dont know the objetive of it
[15:17:16] <epony> AND insistence on shareware-like licensing, that is protective and enforcing propagating (viral) and designed to be one step more free than commercial but still not completely free and not open
[15:17:32] <labrador> sure isf...and there really is no objective
[15:17:45] <isf> exactly
[15:17:55] <labrador> And thats not bad
[15:18:07] <isf> i prefer be part of a mail list/group but with a clear objetive
[15:18:08] <labrador> Its just a place to talk...like irc but e2ee
[15:18:19] <isf> nah for that i prefer irc
[15:18:20] <isf> or xmpp
[15:18:31] <labrador> uh ok sure I'll not be including you in my mails
[15:18:44] <isf> thats the problem, if u use mail like a instant message you start to make full mail box in seconds

[15:18:50] <Andrew> For SPF and DKIM to authenticate a message, the message From: header must match the sending domain. Messages must pass either the SPF or the DKIM check to be authenticated.
[15:19:51] <isf> so thats the problem of sending mail from my provider
[15:19:58] <isf> or from the alias?
[15:20:06] <isf> becouse gnuhacker send messages from the alias like me
[15:20:12] <isf> and him dont have problems right andrew?
[15:20:26] <labrador> isf, doesn't really matter how full your inbox is
[15:20:35] <isf> for me it is
[15:20:35] <labrador> Just minimize the threads
[15:20:40] <isf> becouse i have 3 different alias
[15:20:46] <isf> for 3 different issues labrador
[15:20:52] <labrador> isf, me too. Whats your point?
[15:20:55] <Andrew> isf: Don't use an alias when sending mail
[15:20:57] <isf> i want
[15:21:05] <labrador> Andrew, you're wrong
[15:21:11] <labrador> You can use aliases
[15:21:16] <labrador> It will still verify
[15:21:20] <labrador> Its something else
[15:21:23] <Andrew> labrador: Haha
[15:21:27] <labrador> Or a misconf by fsf
[15:21:38] <Andrew> isf: Set a random alias to andrewyu.org, we'll test it out
[15:21:41] <labrador> Andrew, I myself use aliases when messaging you
[15:21:43] <isf> labrador the point, is when i want something and nothing more in my freedom to choise that 
[15:21:46] <labrador> It definitely works
[15:21:56] <Andrew> labrador: That's why it gets a just-below-threshold warning
[15:21:59] <labrador> isf, you're already out from my perspective
[15:21:59] <isf> is my*
[15:22:03] <labrador> Andrew, wait it does?
[15:22:04] <labrador> really?
[15:22:05] <Andrew> labrador: Read the DKIM docs
[15:22:12] <Andrew> labrador: All aliases from different domains do
[15:22:22] <labrador> Andrew, aliases...
[15:22:27] <labrador> What aliases are you talking about?
[15:22:43] <labrador> Like a@x.org has an alias of b@x.org?
[15:22:58] <isf> but you can move all my messages to the normal box if are moving by defaul to the spam box
[15:23:00] <epony> here is an example of a clearly defined set of goals and objectives:
[15:23:01] <Andrew> i.e., if you set labrador@member.fsf.org to hungrilycaloric@riseup.net, you can receive email from labrador@member.fsf.org
[15:23:05] <epony> http://www.openbsd.org/goals.html
[15:23:17] <epony> see, the list of goas is very clear
[15:23:22] <epony> well defined
[15:23:23] <labrador> Andrew, what does 'setting' mean
[15:23:26] <labrador> In this context
[15:23:33] *** Joins: myzhang1029 (~Thunderbi@64.251.74.34)
[15:23:52] <epony> that set of goals and objectives is missing from "Linux" distributors
[15:24:03] <epony> it can't even be found on GNU homesite
[15:25:00] <epony> so, there are practical differences, on top of the licensing and policy, and that is much more important
[15:25:27] <epony> the software quality, portability, reliability, durability, modularity, reusability..
[15:25:56] <epony> and above all, standards adherence to the important and correct parts of the standard
[15:25:56] <labrador> uh Andrew?
[15:26:17] <epony> cause standards are owned by commercial vendors and consortiums
[15:26:26] <isf> labrador u have riseup right?
[15:26:38] <epony> so is important to follow "open" and also technically "correct" standards
[15:26:39] <labrador> yeah
[15:26:55] <isf> so riseup have a similar block 
[15:26:57] <isf> as a gmail
[15:27:04] <isf> xD
[15:27:17] <labrador> isf, no mostly no there's some problem with you specially tho
[15:27:22] <labrador> gnuhacker's email get a -5
[15:27:24] <epony> that's why MSFT and GOOG and AAPL and AMZN and others "engulf" and "devour" through standards "OWNAGE" is not meaningful / not a threat
[15:27:24] <isf> becouse gmail, have similar problem, they block all my mails from member.fsf.org
[15:27:27] <labrador> You get a 6.7
[15:27:30] <labrador> Thats weird
[15:27:39] <labrador> On the spam scale,more is worse ofc
[15:27:42] <isf> yes becouse my provider isnt a famouse one
[15:27:49] <epony> which is the refutal to "need for zealotry" (no such thing needed)
[15:27:50] <isf> and my
[15:27:53] <labrador> isf, your mail provider is the same as him -_-
[15:27:54] <isf> im not verificated
[15:27:56] <isf> yet
[15:27:59] <labrador> member.fsf.org
[15:28:00] <isf> no
[15:28:01] <labrador> same same
[15:28:05] <isf> member.fsf.org isnt a mail provider
[15:28:06] <labrador> isf, wait really?
[15:28:06] <isf> lol
[15:28:17] <Andrew> labrador: When writing the message/rfc822 file, having a line saying "From: alias@example.org" rather than "From: andrew@andrewyu.org"
[15:28:17] <epony> labrador, are you a member of GNU?
[15:28:28] <isf> i have different mail provider 
[15:28:30] <Andrew> labrador: When I use aliases on my own server, e.g. "box@andrewyu.org", there's no problem
[15:28:33] <Andrew> labrador: Read DKIM docs
[15:28:38] <labrador> isf, ohh which one?
[15:28:43] <Andrew> labrador: FSF member
[15:28:57] <labrador> He just denied it lol
[15:29:05] <labrador> Whats your mail provider isf?
[15:29:13] <isf> the issue is, im not completly verify for my providers yet
[15:29:46] <isf> i cant create accounts for services for example
[15:29:58] <epony> cause GNU is a bit more "technical" and "educated" on software standardisation, and knows its limits and deficiencies and portability objectives
[15:30:07] <labrador> ok Andrew I understand that...basically you're saying sending an email as a@x.org from y.org's smtp server
[15:30:10] <labrador> That fails
[15:30:11] <isf> are blocking between him accept me as a no-bot or something like that
[15:30:26] <isf> but for the other stuff, work works so good for me 
[15:30:27] <labrador> Cause the domain is not authorized as being able to send mail for x.org
[15:30:27] <isf> :D
[15:30:37] <isf> yes i am
[15:30:41] <isf> the problem is your provider

[15:31:01] <isf> receive my mails directly to the main mailbox
[15:31:18] <Andrew> isf: Send email to us without an alias?
[15:31:28] <epony> are you just intentionally drowning the channel with two word sentences of yes no cancel spf dkim spam nonsense?

[15:32:45] <labrador> Same feelings man
[15:32:57] <epony> maybe you just have no idea about GNU after all
[15:33:03] <labrador> hahaha ok

[15:35:26] <epony> I like Qmail, it's the better Sendmail.
[15:35:57] <epony> cause obviously he did not like the BSD or UNIX standard editors
[15:36:25] <epony> but the original Emacs was TECO which was quite similar to QED, which is ED, the VI precursor
[15:36:34] <AwesomeAdam54321> epony: ed is not a human-friendly text editor.
[15:37:12] <epony> and tecmacs and vi are virtually teh same software despite their obvious differences, that's just key bindings themeing
[15:38:02] <epony> while it's just later that emacs became e-tecmacs enhancement with the programmable addition of an embedded lisp to process the macros

[15:41:23] <epony> that UNIX and Unix-like part is entirely secondary and non-substantial yet VERY IMPORTANT

[15:44:32] <epony> at one epoch it was ASM to C and Pascal and Fortran

[15:45:34] <labrador> don't get ahead of yourselves
[15:45:43] <labrador> Lisp was just a design decision
[15:45:50] <labrador> The point was a free UNIX
[15:45:58] <epony> that was BSD's point
[15:46:17] <epony> GNU's point was a Runtime environment
[15:46:56] <labrador> epony, BSDs weren't free back then
[15:47:01] <epony> cause people in the early stages of portability knew they can't start something larger than say a couple of software projects without portability
[15:47:03] <AwesomeAdam54321> epony: I think GNU's point was user freedom, Lisp and the HURD microkernel and free software makes it easy for people to share their modified programs

[15:50:12] <epony> it preserves it, you have to be a responsible carrier
[15:50:25] <epony> as with olympic fire, you can put the torch into the ground
[15:50:35] <epony> but it's not just one fire torch and not just one carrier
[15:50:42] <epony> so fire is free
[15:50:58] <epony> it has no "small set of critical freedoms" ;-)
[15:51:03] <AwesomeAdam54321> epony: But the vast amount of proprietary software companies aren't responsible carriers 
[15:51:15] <labrador> epony, ur wrong
[15:51:21] <labrador> BSDs were not always free
[15:51:28] <labrador> They contained a lot of UNIX code
[15:51:40] <labrador> And were distributed with AT&Ts blessings
[15:51:56] <labrador> You don't even know the history of the OS you use lmao
[15:52:18] <epony> all of the inventions and the technical and technological and scientific and engineering sciences and practical designs, of all knowledge, of all academics, of the entire humanity, is always and has always been free and is being freed and continuing to be free
[15:52:38] <epony> BSD is a set of fixed on top of UNIX
[15:52:47] <epony> so they actually rewrote it all while fixing it
[15:52:52] <epony> in teh process of several year
[15:52:54] <epony> years
[15:53:11] <epony> up to the 1979 release of UNIX was all BSD code
[15:53:12] <labrador> epony, yes but when GNU was started it was still nonfree
[15:53:18] <labrador> So it made sense
[15:53:21] <labrador> Also copyleft
[15:53:26] <epony> GNU can do what it likes ;-)
[15:53:36] <epony> but it does NOT tell you the real GOALS and OBJECTIVES
[15:54:05] <labrador> epony, nope
[15:54:07] <epony> so you remain uneducated and unskilled in the true values and importance, so do not know and can not control that process
[15:54:10] <labrador> The real goals are freedom
[15:54:15] <labrador> Ur wrong
[15:54:19] <AwesomeAdam54321> One of GNU's objectives is to be the foundation of free software development
[15:54:26] <labrador> Ye
[15:54:39] <epony> yeah, that's the political set of its "protective" goalset
[15:54:47] <labrador> epony, hahaha
[15:54:48] <labrador> ok
[15:55:01] *** Joins: vboykox (~user@95.134.34.68)
[15:55:20] <epony> it wants to protect its rights to distribute other people's software under its licensing model to defend the licensing model and the rights of a distributor by asserting rights ot the recipient
[15:55:32] <labrador> yes
[15:55:33] <epony> but it does not assert rights of freedom
[15:55:33] <labrador> true
[15:55:35] <labrador> I like that
[15:55:38] <labrador> epony, it does
[15:55:40] <labrador> ur wrong
[15:55:52] <epony> nope, the opposite of that, it's lock-in
[15:55:57] <labrador> nope
[15:56:06] <labrador> Look again at that luke smith page
[15:56:11] <labrador> And stare deeply at it
[15:56:25] <epony> so it's not an open and free software, it's enforcing freedoms of its own choice policy upon other people's software
[15:56:38] <epony> I don't care who luke smith is.
[15:56:55] <epony> he did not start GNU..
[15:56:55] <labrador> epony, its freedom
[15:56:58] <labrador> can't deny it
[15:57:10] <epony> so he is not on the list of important people
[15:58:09] <epony> important people are people who WRITE software and give it away WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS so that it can COMPETE ON MERITS as in qualities and qualifications and objectives and goals, instead of POLICY AND LICENSES
[15:58:30] <labrador> epony, nope
[15:58:41] <labrador> Freedom to restrict is no freedom
[15:58:44] <epony> the policy and licensing is just a means to delineate "yours is yours we do NOT want it"
[15:58:50] <labrador> Can't be restricted if its not freedom
[15:58:53] * labrador taps head
[15:58:59] <epony> the reality why it is not wanted is, because it DOES NOT MATCH OUR GOALS
[15:59:15] <epony> so the goals being quality and reliability, policy is then WORTHLESS
[15:59:29] <Andrew> When free software becomes the default, I release my software into the public domain
[15:59:39] <Andrew> As of now, when Intel uses Minix, Apple uses the BSDs, I use the AGPL
[15:59:39] <labrador> epony, the goal is freedom
[15:59:40] <labrador> simple
[15:59:48] <labrador> Nothing more nothing less
[15:59:56] <Andrew> To me, GPL is a pragmatic
[15:59:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> epony: there is no agenda there
[16:00:35] <epony> you see, that is why commerce gets the money and the 99% of all installations, because it strives for quality and takes better software, so it steals from BSD intead because it is better quality, but wants you to be stuck with lower quality so sponsors GNU so you proselitise on the internet fake belief systems of restrictions and call that freedom which is HYPOCRICY
[16:00:37] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the main reason copyleft exists is because of the insanity of current copyright law, a system like copyleft sadly is necessary
[16:01:02] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> permissive license would make sense if public domain was still a thing, sadly it no longer is after 
[16:01:11] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> Bern covention epony 
[16:01:30] <epony> well, copyright law is not applicable to software, it should not be, and being used for profiteering is a defect of late capitalism which we should call MONOPOLISM
[16:01:31] <AwesomeAdam54321> If current copyright law was changed back to reasonable terms, then copyleft wouldn't need to exist
[16:01:56] <epony> so labrador here claiming there is only one system is a MONOPOLIST puppet proclamist

[16:02:24] <epony> in the same way that MSFT claims there is only one system, and AAPL saying the same crap, and so on..
[16:02:28] <labrador> a monopoly of freedom is fine
[16:02:34] <epony> labrador, your freedom is not freedom
[16:02:40] <epony> it's restrictive
[16:02:41] <labrador> it is
[16:02:41] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> epony: read this -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention
[16:02:47] <labrador> Freedom to restrict is no freedom
[16:03:02] <epony> labrador, YOUR FREEDOM IS LIMITED FREEDOM SO IT IS NOT FREE
[16:03:06] <labrador> Freedom to restrict is no freedom
[16:03:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "it's restrictive" again said restrictions are sadly necessary because of current copyright
[16:03:26] <labrador> I'll just keep spamming the same thing until you see what I'm saying
[16:03:31] <Andrew> epony: I don't have the freedom to kill you, apparantly?
[16:03:34] <epony> labrador, does a person of colour need a license to tell him he is free, or is it a given natural right to all human beings?
[16:03:44] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> epony: you should study a bit deeper curent copyright law
[16:03:50] <labrador> Freedom to restrict software is no freedom
[16:03:52] <Andrew> If copyright law was better we wouldn't need the GPL, but copyright law as of now is * stupid
[16:04:07] <epony> M3RELATIVISM[m], no, you study that, thus losing your lifetime with pointless studies
[16:04:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> exactly ^^
[16:04:29] <epony> law is protecting profiteering

[16:05:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is irelevant for this discussion though
[16:05:35] <epony> yes, you should know what is relevant better
[16:05:50] <epony> the relevant point is, technical qualities, goals and objectives
[16:05:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the point is you are wrong regarding licenses given you dont know enough about current copyright
[16:06:05] <labrador> epony, nope
[16:06:09] <epony> only lawyers care about the licensing model
[16:06:12] <epony> are you a lawyer?
[16:06:12] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so I suggest you study it a bit further before claiming GPL is "stupid"
[16:06:13] <labrador> the relevant point is freedom

[16:06:24] <epony> the suggestion is considered useless ^

[16:25:44] <epony> but you should collect more songs and recipes
[16:25:50] <epony> cause folklore is fantastic

[16:26:28] <AwesomeAdam54321> epony: The problem is that copyright doesn't apply to recipes, but the same isn't true for software unfortunately
[16:26:53] <epony> you'll know RMS will both agree and disagree because his time and hack was in the "epoch of cranking up licensing" as a protectionism against cancellation of free software
[16:26:56] <epony> now the epoch is different
[16:27:01] <epony> there are MORE COMPUTERS
[16:27:07] <epony> and there is open access to computing
[16:27:30] <AwesomeAdam54321> epony: yes, which is why the problem is even more urgent
[16:27:48] <epony> and recipes flow as folklore because anyone can sing and play the folklore and write down recipes heard on the folklore exchange festivals

[16:38:28] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> the value only lies when logic is prioritized

[16:39:01] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> it is of the upmost importance to allways be open to be proven wrong

[16:41:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> indeed Das Kapital from Marx has thaught us that
[16:42:15] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is why I sugesting sustainable models outside capitalist system
[16:42:22] <epony> so, people should focus writing software in academic and research centres (universities and academic institutions) as models and templates, that are given then to the people as recipes
[16:42:27] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> look into dark.fi/manifesto.html
[16:42:36] <epony> so they can then instantiate their software developments however they like
[16:42:45] <epony> and thus you get it like education
[16:42:49] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "so, people should focus writing software in academic and research centres (universities and academic institutions) as models and templates, that are given then to the people as recipes" indeed
[16:42:56] <epony> at nominal cost paid by the taxes of all the people
[16:42:58] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> but until said system is built
[16:43:05] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> GPL will be necessary :s
[16:43:27] <epony> and thus inequality and injustice of copyright law for software becomes obsolete and useless (it already is obsolete and useless)
[16:43:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> again look into  dark.fi/manifesto.html for a specific implementation of that
[16:43:51] <epony> just you can not accept the fact that the mega corporations for software authorship are.. not needed

[17:29:50] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I totally understand though
[17:29:55] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> matrix is shit
[17:30:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> no concern for privacy<-security<-freedom
[17:30:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> Andrew: yes I do
[17:30:33] <AwesomeAdam54321> M3RELATIVE[m]: For me I'm waiting for Secushare, since federation is flawed
[17:30:52] * M3RELATIVISM[m] never heard of Secushare
[17:31:00] <Andrew> I like federation :)
[17:31:00] <GNUHacker> Andrew because i dont like matrix
[17:31:27] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I just wished there was a common protocol that could be a strong alternative to matrix marketing
[17:31:39] <Andrew> XMPP works
[17:31:42] <Andrew> Email works too
[17:31:45] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> like tox IRC jami and xmpp all being under the same protocol
[17:31:48] <epony> you've obviously not found it
[17:31:49] <kompowiec> IRC is common
[17:31:57] <isf> matrix is bad
[17:31:58] <Andrew> kompowiec: Not federated
[17:32:01] <isf> xmpp, is better
[17:32:08] <kompowiec> yeah...
[17:32:09] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so the is like a strong united common front against matrix
[17:32:16] <Andrew> Matrix, the protocol, isn't too bad.  matrix.org being a metadata center is.
[17:32:40] <AwesomeAdam54321> and signing up on matrix.org uses nonfree javascript
[17:32:48] <hentai> Is this license as bad as it smells?: https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/blob/master/COPYING
[17:32:49] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> matrix the protocol is to specific to the implementation itself
[17:33:02] <kompowiec> so if matrix is build like usenet, at which point when usenet decentralized
[17:33:04] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> o/ hentai 
[17:33:05] <kompowiec> hmm
[17:33:09] <hentai> The clauses seem to make it incompatible with LGPL
[17:33:16] <hentai> Or am I wrong?
[17:33:33] <hentai> \o
[17:33:42] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> my point is would be good to make IRC extensable to the point tox/jami and other can be complaint
[17:33:56] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> or make a IRC->XMPP bridge
[17:34:00] <epony> now, what did we learn today, children, repeat after me.. open standards, open architecture, open systems, open formats, open specifications, open communications, open ideas, open knowledge, open information (you can use the word free too, but it does not reach the depth in all areas)
[17:34:05] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that could then unite the project
[17:34:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> into a single counter acting fource to matrix propaganda
[17:34:36] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> sadly efforts to solve issues with matrix
[17:34:43] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> were ignores and censored
[17:34:43] <kompowiec> i think that IRC is good to be central point of place
[17:34:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> with network wide bans and issue reports being locked
[17:35:07] <epony> find the ones that say "open standard"  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols
[17:35:08] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> :s;s:S;S
[17:35:30] <hentai> I liked Jami, up to the point I found that nobody I know uses it :D
[17:35:41] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> i think that IRC is good to be central point of place yeah but IRC needs to become distributed and encrypted 
[17:35:47] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if it is a valid option
[17:36:02] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> which currently is not defenately not the case
[17:36:06] <kompowiec> encrypted rooms? meh
[17:36:08] <hentai> Also, the name change is pretty bad imo
[17:36:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> P2Pirc would be nice
[17:36:11] <AwesomeAdam54321> M3RELATIVISM[m]: I think IRC is already encrypted on libera.chat
[17:36:19] <epony> now, see the mobile devices are NOT an open system or open architecture
[17:36:26] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> kompowiec: not rooms but 1-1
[17:36:26] <kompowiec> any major IRC provider offer TLS

[17:42:44] <hentai> Is this license LGPL2.1 compatible: https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/blob/master/COPYING
[17:42:47] <epony> you can find him as laforge in the osmocom chan
[17:43:10] <hentai> Upon the answer lies whether I am to try to get the project onto a license which is compatible, or not
[17:43:41] <AwesomeAdam54321> hentai: Yes, I think it's the ISC license: https://www.isc.org/licenses/
[17:44:33] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> hentai: seams like a simplt permissive license
[17:44:43] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> no clause makes it imcompatible
[17:44:47] <jxself> https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#ISC
[17:44:48] *** Joins: LibreGNU (~gnu@vps-93-95-226-254.1984.is)
[17:44:55] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> as long as copyright heaser is included
[17:45:02] <epony> hentai, so the fact that projects exist attempting to provide free software for the mobile handhelds does not mean that the devices are open architecture or an open software system ;-)
[17:45:03] <hentai> AwesomeAdam54321, What about the "provided that the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies"
[17:45:17] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> which it a clause by LGPL as well so
[17:45:26] <labrador> hentai, nice nick
[17:45:28] <jxself> It's common that license require preservation of copyright & license notices.
[17:45:34] <jxself> Even the LGPL, GPL, and AGPL require that.
[17:45:35] <epony> hentai, otherwise they'd be like modern desktop and server computers, reliable and working with free software
[17:45:54] <jxself> So: You must keep those in regardless!
[17:45:59] <hentai> epony, Ever seen your UEFI implementation sources?
[17:46:04] <hentai> epony, Me neither
[17:46:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "It's common license require preservation of copyright & license notices.
[17:46:10] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> Even the LGPL, GPL, and AGPL require that."exactly ^^ hentai 
[17:46:22] <epony> hentai, legacy hardware here, UEFI is not on my machines yet
[17:46:34] <hentai> epony, s/UEFI/BIOS/ then
[17:46:55] <jxself> libreboot with GRUB payload! Doesn't even provide a traditional BIOS interface.
[17:47:17] <hentai> M3RELATIVISM[m], I interpret that as "no changing licenses"
[17:47:27] <epony> hentai, well, I know the BIOS on my systems works without loading malware before my software
[17:47:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> why is that
[17:47:36] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> its just a clause
[17:47:46] <epony> hentai, a thing you can not confirm on mobile devices and laptops
[17:47:50] <jxself> hentai: In a way you're right - You're not "changing" the license per se. But the two liceneses are compatible.
[17:47:56] *** Joins: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c)
[17:47:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if derivative works license covers that clause then it is coveres
[17:48:09] <hentai> M3RELATIVISM[m], Well, if I preserve the ISC license, how can I license it under LGPL, which forbids adding to itself
[17:48:24] <jxself> hentai: You're not "licensing" that piece under LGPL though.
[17:48:27] <epony> hentai, also I can choose to use another BIOS if it supports my mainboards, which is again not an option on the said crippled devices
[17:48:29] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> no need to preserv openbsd licens
[17:48:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you just add LGPL to you derivative bit
[17:48:53] <hentai> jxself, I would take chunks of code and integrate it into LGPL licensed files. What would that be?
[17:48:58] <jxself> The combined whole of the two are under the LGPL but people can still rip out that ISC piece and use it under the original license. It only "becomes" LGPL as part of the larger combined whole.
[17:49:06] <jxself> hentai: Here's an example: 
[17:49:06] <epony> M3RELATIVISM[m], isn't that exactly what GNU projects that take BSD and rename it do for real?
[17:49:14] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> exactly LGPL already covers such clause
[17:49:18] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so its not a problem
[17:49:35] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> hentai: think of a license and a set list of rules one needs to follow
[17:49:35] <jxself> hentai: https://softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/gpl-non-gpl-collaboration.html
[17:49:38] <jxself> Check out #2.2
[17:49:43] <jxself> You end up with multiple license notices
[17:49:51] <epony> hasn't stopped you from stealing any BSD system and calling it a GNU system so far ;-)
[17:49:55] <jxself> "Even though the permissive license of the external project grants legal permission to incorporate code from that project into a GPL’d project, the developer of the GPL’d project must nonetheless comply with the notice preservation requirement in the permissive license."
[17:49:56] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> if does rules are covered by a even bigger list of rules 
[17:50:02] <epony> you really have no means of enforcing copyright law for software
[17:50:03] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> then there is not problem 
[17:50:21] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> given bigger list of rules already cover previous clause
[17:50:23] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ;)
[17:50:45] <hentai> I just mean, that the end result of integration is hardly anything you can later extract
[17:50:58] <epony> technically, everyone takes everything, even proprietary software and rips it apart, reverse engineers what they can and re-implements it as they see fit
[17:51:04] <jxself> That later extraction would be an exercise for the user.
[17:51:10] <hentai> Essentially, I want to look at their codebase, and rewrite the FSB module of FFmpeg based on that
[17:51:13] <jxself> "Even though the permissive license of the external project grants legal permission to incorporate code from that project into a GPL’d project, the developer of the GPL’d project must nonetheless comply with the notice preservation requirement in the permissive license."

[17:51:22] <jxself> That still applies to you regardless.
[17:51:24] <epony> what are you going to do, go into their headquarters and ask to see their secret projects? ;-)
[17:51:38] <epony> that's what Apple did to Microsoft
[17:51:43] <jxself> The whole of https://softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/gpl-non-gpl-collaboration.html is a good read but at least check out #2.2 if you don't read the whole thing :)
[17:51:49] <epony> or what Apple did to Xerox
[17:52:01] <AwesomeAdam54321> jxself: So if you combine the headers, then it can be licensed under the LGPL2.1
[17:52:20] <jxself> Here's another example: https://jxself.org/git/?p=beyond-the-titanic.git;a=tree
[17:52:25] <jxself> I made AGPL changed to a GPL program.
[17:52:35] <jxself> Notice there are copies of both GPL & AGPL licenses.
[17:52:43] <jxself> Then: https://jxself.org/git/?p=beyond-the-titanic.git;a=blob;f=src/BEYOND.PAS;h=e129840e95c06b00850abb9fd76f6b96af1fc02e;hb=HEAD
[17:52:52] <epony> you really WANT your software to be used, that way you have influence and control and recognition and adoption and points with standardisation and the direction the software evolves
[17:52:53] <jxself> You have multiple license notices talking of GPL and AGPL.
[17:52:56] <hentai> Well, I wonder as to whether FFmpeg developers would feel about needing to also retain the ISC license notice. Gotta go ask #ffmpeg
[17:53:10] *** Quits: fatal (~0x00@user/fatal) (Remote host closed the connection)
[17:53:23] *** Joins: fatal (~0x00@user/fatal)
[17:53:26] <jxself> How they'd feel is not really relevant. It's a requirement of the license. So keep them or violate the license. :)
[17:53:47] <jxself> The license doesn't ask for much - Just to keep the notices in. :)
[17:53:51] <epony> setting a fancier more complex license (also known as license cranking) is not progressing your software in that direction, it is making it more enforcing and limiting or constrained use and.. again you can't really seek your rights and compensation so no enforcement
[17:53:53] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> I wouldnt include header given said clause is already covered
[17:54:06] <epony> it ends up just hurting other free software projects, mostly smaller than you
[17:54:25] *** Joins: zoe (~zoe@fsf/member/zoe)
[17:54:38] <epony> so is the tactic of commercial vendors that stiffle small projects by buying them off or stealing their developers and contractors

[17:55:11] <epony> M3RELATIVISM[m], you think it's air you're breathing ;-) Neo
[17:55:13] <hentai> jxself, What matters is whether I can, or cannot contribute to upstream FFmpeg development, or gotta make a doomed fork
[17:55:17] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> you could include a disclaimer for it though redirecting to COPYING file
[17:55:45] <jxself> hentai: From a licensing point of view there's no issue, as long as the notices are retained.
[17:56:08] <AwesomeAdam54321> It's best if the licenses are in the source code files themselves though
[17:56:12] <jxself> For another example, look at the kernel named Linux. The effective license is GPLv2 but if you actually go look you'll find lots of other license notices too. Including ISC.
[17:56:39] <hentai> jxself, At least one FFmpeg developer expressed that he is fine as long as the copyright notice is retained in the source code file
[17:56:46] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> "It's best if the licenses are in the source code files themselves though" LGPL license is already in
[17:56:46] <hentai> So, questions answered
[17:56:53] <jxself> Ta da
[17:57:31] <hentai> Thank you all but epony
[17:57:34] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> so what you include both headers?
[17:57:47] <jxself> Yes.
[17:57:47] <hentai> M3RELATIVISM[m], Guess thats what I gotta do
[17:57:57] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> isnt that unclonclusive and lead to unentend duallicensing?
[17:58:06] <jxself> No.
[17:58:08] <AwesomeAdam54321> M3RELATIVISM[m]: Yep, the LGPL license header, than a notice about the ISC license header
[17:58:17] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is basically forcing his changes to be released under ISC as well
[17:58:23] <jxself> m3relativism[m]: https://softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/gpl-non-gpl-collaboration.html
[17:58:26] <jxself> Check out #2.2
[17:58:34] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> ok
[17:58:38] * M3RELATIVISM[m] goes check
[17:58:46] <jxself> It communicates that it's under GPL (or LGPL) and "incorporates" the following.
[17:59:00] <jxself> Not that it *is* all ISC licensed itsef :)
[17:59:04] <AwesomeAdam54321> I should have been clear about that when I said it
[17:59:06] <jxself> Or all dual or whatever.
[17:59:21] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> oh ok
[17:59:31] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> that is obvious enough
[17:59:41] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> given note used above

[18:03:14] <epony> "The GNU Public License and licenses modeled on it impose the restriction that source code must be distributed or made available for all works that are derivatives of the GNU copyrighted code. 
[18:03:14] <epony> While this may superficially look like a noble strategy, it is a condition that is typically unacceptable for commercial use of software. So in practice, it usually ends up hindering free sharing and reuse of code and ideas rather than encouraging it. As a consequence, no additional software bound by the GPL terms will be considered for inclusion into the OpenBSD base system. 
[18:03:14] <epony> For historical reasons, the OpenBSD base system still includes the following GPL-licensed components: the GNU compiler collection (GCC) with supporting binutils and libraries, GNU CVS, GNU texinfo, the mkhybrid file system creation tool, and the readline library. Replacement by equivalent, more freely licensed tools is a long-term desideratum."

[18:08:56] <epony> you can't have free software in a non-free society, so you choose to support non-freedoms (copyright law which asserts the economic rights of distributors)
[18:10:16] <epony> so you have partial freedoms, of which you list a couple and think it's enough, but that is less than optimal, which would be minimal restructions (approaching and attempting to be none)

[18:20:53] <epony> who are we kidding, our opinions do not matter much.. so why are two people arguing about something as obsolete as licensing software as 'law' carrier?
[18:21:10] <epony> software is not a carrier of law, you know that.
[18:22:16] <epony> it carries a relation of power and control that is used for extracting profit and force services and perform data and information theft and other indecent and non-humane crimes
[18:23:11] <epony> it's not the license protecting against that, it's the quality and correctness of the software
[18:24:27] <epony> so a validity certificate of authenticity and verifiable certainty is more important than any mangled in transit accompanying letter of "intended limitations"
[18:24:52] <epony> as in reproducible qualities correct and reliable system
[18:26:02] <epony> that is what people put as important concerns about software, and they usually get some partial sub-set of it from their favourite free software vendor, not because of the licensing, because they can check and confirm, but they don't confirm and have no means to do so

[19:40:25] <ggoes> M3RELATIVISM[m]: please stop trash talking people
[19:40:30] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> by the way vitali64 such ban has since been corrected

[19:42:10] <tesseract> M3RELATIVISM[m]: why did they ban you
[19:42:22] <ggoes> even if what you're saying happened happened, and i don't know that it did, it doesn't belong in a public chat room
[19:42:34] <ggoes> Noisytoot: i'm aware; i was just being expedient / typing too fast
[19:42:45] <Noisytoot> Is rms really rms?
[19:42:47] <ggoes> no
[19:42:48] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> tesseract: abusive ban has been corrected since

[19:45:50] <Noisytoot> It just loads infinitely
[19:45:51] <vitali64> by disabling qt hardware acceleration, the problem is solved

[19:46:05] <vitali64> M3RELATIVISM[m]: I never asked for it

[19:46:32] <vitali64[m]> please
[19:46:59] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> vitali64: you did "... commit ban evasion?" obviously there was a agenda there given it is a lie
[19:47:16] <M3RELATIVISM[m]> given has said ban was abusive and not related to this room 
[19:47:35] <vitali64[m]> I thought this was #fsf
