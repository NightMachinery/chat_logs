[02:13:21] <jcbjoe2021> So I'm learning the Ins and outs of  git right . I think the next stage is uploading it to GitHub. Im not a programmer or anything and don't have any projects I just want to learn git just so I know it. Should I upload to GitHub or just stay in the terminal and learn more? Any ideas?
[02:13:48] <mackerman> jcbjoe2021: GitHub is not the only git hosting
[02:14:26] <mackerman> However you probably want to find a git host to upload to,  for collaboration and backup
[02:15:53] <mackerman> Also,  step zero is finding a thing you care about that has text files, so you can put them in version control.
[02:16:03] <mackerman> Easier to get motivated when you have a specific problem to solve.

[03:31:26] <bremner> ok. So just look at the log and checkout the hash you want
[03:33:52] <Oleg> well, that's what I did before. I just wanted to find a way for it to checkout the files that I need, such as autogen.sh and configure.ac

[12:54:28] <DevAntoine> Your branch and 'origin/develop' have diverged, and have 1 and 19 different commits each, respectively.
[12:54:50] <DevAntoine> If my local branch was up to date that means someone forced push on develop?

[22:35:39] <cbreak> that makes no sense :/
[22:35:48] <mfiano> Why do you say that?
[22:36:01] <cbreak> because you said yourself you want to retain branch histories
[22:36:20] <cbreak> rewording is history rewriting, which by definition doesn't retain history
[22:36:47] <mfiano> I want the preexisting commit messages to be annotated with the sub-repository they came from. Otherwise I may have many different adjacent commit messages that are the same or do not have enough context (for quick fixes)
[22:36:52] <cbreak> if you want to see commits for only a subdir, you can use git log -- subdir
[22:37:07] <cbreak> or you can use git log --stat / --numstat / ... to see which files changed
[22:38:11] <cbreak> mfiano: if you're fine with discarding the old history, then you can use git filter-branch with a --msg-filter

[22:38:19] <mfiano> I want to retain the history of changes, yes. But the original repositories will be replaced with the mono-repo, so rewording the new commits is fine, as long as they aren't removed/squashed.
[22:38:23] <cbreak> just filter all repos before you merge them

[22:39:05] <cbreak> (note: monolythic repos are dumb)
[22:39:47] <mfiano> "monolithic", and it makes sense for some code bases.

[23:25:54] <rkta> I'm working with code that indents with 4 and tabwidth 8. So indentation is a mixture of tabs and spaces, e.g. indentation level of 3 is one tab followed by 4 spaces. I want git diff to show the tabs so that I can see if the identation is made with the correct characters. How I can I do that?

[23:31:33] <Nei> maybe you can instead use clangformat to make it fix all indentation for you

[23:38:06] <rkta> I was hoping for a native solution... maybe I'll create an alias to pipe diff to sed.
[23:38:19] <Habbie> 'cat -A' might be easier than sed
[23:39:02] <Habbie> less -U is even better
[23:39:03] <rkta> cat -A doesn't really improve readability though

[23:41:29] <MrFantastik> the others though...
[23:41:30] <Nei> just something like git diff --color | sed -e 's/\t/`¨¨¨¨¨¨´/g'
[23:41:34] <rkta> I'll stick with sed, than I can replace tabs with 8 other chars.
