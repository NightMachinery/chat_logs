[00:00:15] <vms14> I don't see the fun in java, but makes me wonder what would be "funnier": lisp or forth
[00:00:16] <aeth> I once played a strategy/resource/building game written in Java and I ran `htop` and sure enough it was saturating every core
[00:00:21] <aeth> can't do that in a traditional game engine
[00:00:32] <vms14> xD
[00:00:53] <vms14> like the spring framework asking for 1G of ram 
[00:01:07] <vms14> and won't work if you have no network connection
[00:01:25] <vms14> but, I liked spring when I was in  shitty java course
[00:01:36] <vms14> I mean, it's fine
[00:02:17] <moon-child> aeth: at one point, I came up with a scheme for a game engine where it would automatically take advantage of as many cores as you had
[00:02:37] <moon-child> kinda actor-ish
[00:02:58] <moon-child> also fun things like time travel and networked multiplayer mostly for free
[00:03:20] <aeth> the thing is
[00:03:34] <aeth> it's likely that the threads offered nothing in terms of performance gain
[00:03:47] <aeth> but it was probably still neat how easy it was for the gamedev to multithread in Java
[00:04:11] <aeth> in theory, a game is very parallelizable
[00:04:30] <moon-child> yeah
[00:04:48] <selwyn> uh
[00:04:55] <selwyn> how is a game parallelisable
[00:05:19] <aeth> in practice, a gamedev would rather have a really fast one core (or dual core) CPU because it's easier to fake concurrency by switching tasks back and forth within one frame
[00:05:30] <aeth> A B C | A B C | A B C
[00:05:42] <moon-child> I think some games were using pipelining
[00:05:47] <moon-child> I don't really like that though
[00:05:49] <moon-child> ugly
[00:06:08] <vms14> I hope I won't need so much cpu
[00:06:21] <vms14> I aim for a 2d game
[00:06:40] <aeth> selwyn: the problem is that it has a bunch of bottlenecks, especially the input and any older API like OpenGL (instead of e.g. Vulkan)
[00:06:57] <aeth> as well as the need for a thread to determine the source of truth
[00:07:13] <aeth> does that knight still exist on that square?
[00:07:41] <aeth> otherwise, huge parts of the game are parallelizable: AI, rendering, physics, etc. Rendering mostly goes to the GPU
[00:10:50] <moon-child> 'source of truth'  this is what my threading scheme aimed to solve
[00:11:14] <moon-child> the world is divided up into thingies, and each thingy derives its own state on the next frame from the entire world state on the previous frame
[00:11:37] <moon-child> so each thingy can computer in parallel.  Can also send each other messages, so you have to be careful not to have ordering constraints, but that's it
[00:13:33] <moon-child> s/r//
[00:15:46] <aeth> syncing every frame might not be ideal for everything, especially when you start having 16-32 hardware threads
[00:15:59] <aeth> a lot of things shouldn't really care, like the AI
[00:17:22] <aeth> a lot of things are effectively independent of everything else, which is why the "main thread" worked well on quad cores
[00:17:57] <moon-child> huh ... I never considered not syncing every frame

[00:47:40] <vms14> and btw I told you python for a job because you happen to like and know it
[00:47:53] <vms14> but faster is to get a job in java or php
[00:48:04] <vms14> or even node/browser js
[00:48:33] <vms14> anyways python stills get presence in the job market and I see it more every day
[00:49:07] <vms14> I wouldn't mind to get a php job
[00:49:31] <vms14> but for that I have first to use php as my main language and make several projects with it, so nope
[00:50:08] <vms14> I prefer to work as a waiter and program in spare time in stuff I really like
[00:50:39] <vms14> should I let a cv in macdonalds, but I'm vegan xD
[00:51:04] <vms14> mcdonalds*
[00:51:40] <vms14> and the time I went vegan I was going to the burguer king almost every day, so I think it saved my life
[00:51:48] <vms14> ahahaha
[00:52:10] <vms14> I think it's 7 years yet from that day
[00:53:49] <hayley> According to someone I should have no problems finding a well paying CS job. Well, I have no formal qualification, which is why I am pretending to attend university.
[00:54:29] <selwyn> i wonder what my life would be like if i just did coding instead of a phd
[00:55:39] <vms14> hayley: yes, I think you can amaze most of people you have an interview with
[00:56:09] <vms14> but also depends on how much pressure you have to get a job
[00:56:17] <hayley> I have no degree, and I've barely been in the industry. Not like I'm getting an interview.
[00:56:20] <vms14> if you want a job just now, or can wait
[00:56:48] <hayley> vms14: Not that I want to work, but I don't get money from the government for studying part-time, and my mother is too sick to work anymore.
[00:56:52] <vms14> hayley: you have a lot of knowledge and I think you are a very good programmer (much higher than most of competence)

[00:57:51] <vms14> the problem is a recruiter won't understand anything you explain so they can't really judge
[00:58:04] <vms14> .*(hate them)
[00:58:31] <vms14> they can't even make me the interview in english
[00:59:16] <vms14> if you're in a hurry, then take any job that let's you continue with your life
[00:59:25] <vms14> even if it's not a programmer one
[00:59:53] <vms14> if you get a half journey (idk how to say it in english) it will let you study
[01:00:11] <vms14> and I think you can get some payment or help with studies
[01:00:30] <hayley> A part-time job? Yes. Payment for studying? No.
[01:00:31] <vms14> also study + work is hard
[01:00:35] <vms14> yes, sorry xD
[01:01:19] <vms14> I think you can have some stuff at least cheaper, and in some universities if you demonstrate some value they can help you
[01:01:43] <vms14> I would ask the director or someone who is in charge of this stuff to see what options are
[01:02:24] <vms14> there must be some kind of projects for people who wants to study but has troubles with money
[01:02:48] <vms14> I would try them all
[01:03:15] <vms14> anyways a lot of job offers are looking for people who is studying
[01:03:23] <vms14> you won't like them, yes
[01:03:45] <vms14> but if you study you'll eventually get the job you want, after a lot of effort

[01:09:25] <ioa> hayley I'm sorry it seems tough to finance your studies without having to work apparently! I think that's unfair, everyone should be able to study for free and be supported from the state.
[01:10:15] <hayley> I would get paid if I was studying full time, but transferring to another university left me with gaps in my schedule. But indeed I have to pay for university in either case.
[01:11:19] <vms14> try everything in order to not stop your study
[01:11:57] <ioa> That's messed up that they don't count you as full time although it's an artifact from the transfer!! Also having to pay for university is messed up imo.

[01:34:29] <selwyn> one of our phd students is from barcelona as well
[01:34:40] <selwyn> so all of a sudden most of my contacts come from spain actually
[01:35:07] <vms14> but I think if I prefer to work as a waiter (which I have experience with) than to start learning java/php and doing projects with them as portfolio
[01:36:22] <vms14> the only programming languages I target are lisp, perl and still thinking about forth
[01:36:35] <vms14> none of which will give me a job
[01:36:45] <vms14> unless I make a startup or something
[01:37:24] <vms14> I'm not a senior, so to get a junior job, the best way is to just go for java
[01:37:36] <vms14> java will get you a job very fast as a junior
[01:38:03] <vms14> but made a java course and realized I don't want to live with java 
[01:38:35] <vms14> and recruiters want to see applications and stuff written in those languages

[01:42:29] <selwyn> i agree
[01:42:59] <selwyn> problem with being good at stuff, is that there is pressure to use your talents in the best way
[01:43:08] <selwyn> and this is not always easy

[01:43:54] <hayley> shka: I dunno.
[01:44:35] <hayley> Last job, I worked for AU$30/hour or about €20/hour. I've seen contractors that are some integer multiple of that IIRC.
[01:44:36] <vms14> lol
[01:44:53] <selwyn> i've suggested foraging for outback grub to save $
[01:45:01] <shka> yeah, i can't afford that
[01:45:14] <vms14> my average salary is 900/1000 euros
[01:45:17] <vms14> xD
[01:45:24] <vms14> as a waiter
[01:45:45] <selwyn> i got an advert once for a polish postdoc
[01:45:45] <hayley> I will add that x86-64 code generation requires many frequent breaks, which I didn't charge for.
[01:45:46] <vms14> and I usually work much more hours than what I get paid
[01:45:49] <selwyn> i don't think it paid that well
[01:46:53] <vms14> I wanted a programming job, but not at the cost of using a language I don't care about
[01:47:19] <vms14> my goal was to get a job so it would force me to be a much better programmer
[01:47:50] <vms14> but meh, I'll suck at programming and stay torturing people with my code
[01:48:26] <vms14> actually the idea of having coworkers with more knowledge than me really interests me
[01:49:08] <vms14> I like to suck knowledge from people like a bloodsucker
[01:49:45] <vms14> they had to invest years in learn stuff that they can teach me in some minutes
[01:50:52] <vms14> also the reason I came to lisp is because they promised it will make me a better programmer
[01:51:04] <vms14> but they didn't told me I couldn't escape from lisp later
[01:52:17] <vms14> what makes me think a bit is a lot of forthwrights (forth devs) seem to have learnt lisp and still prefer forth
[01:53:05] <vms14> I see a lot of forthwrights say they know lisp, which is weird as usually once you came to lisp there is hardly a way back
[01:53:22] <vms14> you'll start missing macros everywhere and more stuff

[02:55:33] <vms14> and how do you think will everyithing end?
[02:55:39] <vms14> everything*
[02:55:41] <pl> but it's the way of Putin's favourite philosopher
[02:55:52] <pl> vms14: dunno
[02:56:05] <shka> he has very weird way of understanding "culture"
[02:56:24] <shka> also, Putin's legitimacy is very shaky
[02:56:29] <pl> I have the comfort that if they go to nuking secondary targets in Poland, I probably won't feel a thing
[02:58:08] <vms14> I somehow fear this can end in bigger things involving more countries
[02:59:13] <vms14> and what it triggers me is the alliance with china
[02:59:30] <shka> https://www.amazon.com/War-Eternity-Return-Traditionalism-Populist-ebook/dp/B0824H9G6F
[02:59:32] <vms14> russia and china have a lot of "military" power
[02:59:39] <shka> i recommend reading this book
[03:00:37] <shka> russia? not really as it seems
[03:00:41] <vms14> I think the power china + russia have is something that deserves some fear
[03:01:39] <shka> all of this time world was wondering how country with relatively moderate GDP could have massive army, large air force, fleet of submarines, and a thousands of nuclear weapons
[03:01:48] <pl> vms14: thing is, there's no Russia+China alliance
[03:02:15] <shka> but it turns out, a lot of russian military is actually just a smoke screen
[03:02:35] <shka> but they have shitload of artillery
[03:02:44] <shka> which is a problem in ukraine
[03:02:57] <waleee> vms14: are you from Romania? noticed that at least Ukraine is "Ucraina" there in various news
[03:03:25] <pl> shka: more like the corruption is bigger than even they thought
[03:03:38] <shka> pl: that as well
[03:03:50] <pl> shka: there was some interesting writing about Russian GDP structure, from a Russian, back before 2010
[03:04:04] <shka> apparently there are combat vehicles lacking radios in them
[03:04:16] <pl> talking about how Poland ended up much better by not concentrating on military-adjacaent industry
[03:04:25] <shka> because there were precious metals in them so soldiers simply sold it for scraps
[03:04:48] <vms14> waleee: from spain
[03:04:53] <shka> pl: sounds interesting, would love to see it 
[03:05:02] <vms14> China and Russia currently enjoy the best relations they have had since the late 1950s. Although they have no formal alliance, the two countries do have an informal agreement to coordinate diplomatic and economic moves, and build up an alliance against the United States.
[03:05:22] <vms14> for me is an alliance
[03:05:37] *** Joins: dave0 (~davezero@069.d.003.ncl.iprimus.net.au)
[03:05:43] <waleee> one of them is massively more influential than the other
[03:09:15] <waleee> it's not like in pre-WW2 when Italy was posturing being somewhat on equal level to Germany as a great power
[03:11:51] <waleee> basically Russia is looking like fascist Italy a bit into the war, when they were bogged down in Greece. But with nukes
[03:12:43] <vms14> idk but does not seem it will end fine
[03:13:26] <vms14> and if china and russia were against the US this seems like a step
[03:13:47] <waleee> I'd assume China very much prefers to enjoy all that sweet trade cash, instead of enjoying a nuclear war instigated by Russia
[03:19:59] <waleee> vms14: also you do realize that there's only 140 million people in Russia? (re "Russia uses this to start a war with Europe")
[03:20:31] <vms14> waleee: idk about the people, but the weapons they have
[03:20:43] <vms14> and they seem to had invest some time and money in weapons
[03:21:02] <vms14> have invested*
[03:21:08] <waleee> seems to work superb in Ukraine atm
[03:21:37] <vms14> also it's the russia + china what triggers me
[03:21:55] <vms14> china told US it was "bad" to send weapons to ukraine
[03:22:02] <waleee> wtf would China get involved militarily

[03:25:52] <waleee> if you visit Xinhua's english page you will notice a lack of any hard statements
[03:26:51] <vms14> there is a video I saw some years ago
[03:27:22] <vms14> in my case I'm christian so I believe in the bible and the apocalipsis tells about some signals when the end comes
[03:27:49] <vms14> and christ says "when there is rumors of war, the end is near
[03:27:51] <vms14> "
[03:28:06] <vms14> but that video isn't made by christians
[03:28:19] <vms14> and somehow says the same stuff
[03:28:24] <waleee> some smallish Indian newssite
[03:29:00] <waleee> vms14: there have been massive amounts of war since the bible was written

[03:33:06] <vms14> and this video is from 2012, there was no covid

[03:43:18] <vms14> actually that happened yet
[03:43:49] <vms14> idk in your country but here were like one year only with covid in the news
[03:43:50] <waleee> vms14: at previously stated the message of the Spanish video was clear, even if I regard it as a bunch of bs
[03:44:32] <vms14> and it astounds me how this had affected over people control
[03:44:55] <neominimum> vms14: There is always something bad happening in the world somewhere. Those sort of doomer predictions are so general that they can be fit to a huge number of instances, and are almost entirely based on unverifiable claims. They are arbitrary conclusions primarily based in fear of the unknown future.
[03:45:07] <vms14> also why the only idea all the world had to stop covid was to "stay in home"
[03:45:24] <vms14> fking the whole economy
[03:46:33] <vms14> neominimum: yes, I don't usually see videos like this one, but I think all it says can actually happen, also talks about the chip, the chip has some weird relation with the bible
[03:47:07] <vms14> in the bible says in the last time we will be forced to put the "beast's mark" in your right hand or in your head
[03:47:38] <vms14> and this chip is put exactly there because it recharges with difference of temperature
[03:48:07] <vms14> also says one of the seals is removed all marked people will have pestilent ulcer
[03:48:29] <vms14> and the chip has a lithium battery that if explodes will get you a pestilent ulcer
[03:48:48] <waleee> a lithium battery burn isn't contagious
[03:48:59] <neominimum> My advice? Forget about it. These things have a way of lodging themselves in our human psyche. There are more productive things to think about.
[03:49:02] <vms14> who said contagious? 
[03:49:10] <waleee> "pestilent"
[03:49:23] <waleee> it usually refers to something self spreading

[03:55:52] <waleee> not data
[03:57:33] <waleee> oops. 32% euro I meant, not "rubles in rubles" :D
[03:57:50] <neominimum> You were just saying how it spooks you a little to hear of events that the bible talks about materialising in the world. What a lot of people who subscribe to the truth of these events miss, is the point that the bible says that there is only one instigator. The beast, or the devil. But that is not the case in the real world is it. One must fabricate a conspiracy to begin conecting the dots. Even if there was a conspiracy one could still not 
[03:57:50] <neominimum> link that to the devil without hard evidence, but fear makes people irrational.
[04:10:06] <vms14> the link to the devil is easy
[04:10:20] <vms14> everything that is a sin comes from him
[04:10:57] <vms14> the bible says your war is not with your neighbour
[04:11:04] <vms14> but the devil behind moving him
[04:11:07] <vms14> and you
[04:12:59] <vms14> anyways I understand you won't believe the stuff and even less if it's me who says it after of the other stuff I've said
[04:13:09] <vms14> I didn't believe in God when I was younger
[04:13:59] <vms14> my main problem is I'm gay and never understood how God could be good and condemn me for being gay when I didn't really choose that path (it's not a thing you wake up and decide)
[04:14:20] <vms14> also all the wrong stuff that happens in the world, if there was a ruler, wouldn't happen
[04:15:02] <vms14> my main complaint was: how can God exist and be good if he sees how a little girl who did nothing bad gets violated until death and do nothing
[04:15:53] <vms14> and more questions usually people ask that no one will be able to answer and if we answer them won't be accepted as a correct nor logical answer
[04:16:41] <vms14> so I understand if you don't even care to check if what I say is true and discard it immediately as false
[04:17:00] <vms14> specially if I come with conspiranoic videos xD
[04:17:16] <vms14> but what I can tell is
[04:17:51] <vms14> when I met God, I was into prostitution and I had all my life a heavy addiction to smoking weed
[04:18:26] <vms14> and I thought I was living a nice life as everything I wanted I could have it, and I had money and whatever desired
[04:19:26] <vms14> but if you pursue fame, honor, money or stuff alike in this world, thinking your life would get better or that's what you need. You're much more wrong than all the words I've said there
[04:19:52] <vms14> ask people with money if they're happy
[04:20:22] <vms14> and then you'll see a guy living in the street who is happy because someone gave him food
[04:20:26] <waleee> for sure they are more happy than people with 0 money
[04:20:37] <vms14> waleee: you're fucking wrong
[04:20:42] <vms14> but it's ok
[04:20:57] <waleee> if the guy on the street had money ha would have had food already
[04:21:02] <vms14> go pursue money and get rich
[04:21:23] <vms14> then come back and tell us about ur happiness
[04:21:34] <waleee> so you would be prefering to be starving?
[04:21:48] <waleee> (and unhappy)
[04:21:52] <vms14> I'd prefer to pursue things that have real value
[04:22:04] <vms14> like having a child
[04:22:43] <waleee> nothing that says you can't have enough money to live unstarving _and_ pursue worthy goals 
[04:22:49] <vms14> also, there is a lot of rich people who commited suicide when they ended without money
[04:23:07] <vms14> and a lot more who simply commited suicide having that money
[04:23:39] <vms14> waleee: if you pursue have "enough" money it's fine
[04:23:54] <vms14> sorry for my english I know it sucks
[04:24:13] <waleee> a lot of not-super rich also commit suicide when they run out of money and have crippling debts
[04:24:16] <vms14> the problem is when money is your only goal
[04:24:29] <neominimum> I would argue that money is a substitute for happiness, but it's only temporary. Either the money runs out or one eventually loses the joy that is attributed to material possessions (having been bought with said money). This is the basis of endless consumer mindset.
[04:24:32] <vms14> or fame or stuff
[04:24:56] <vms14> they won't give you what you really need, but you think it's what you need
[04:25:38] <vms14> For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
[04:26:21] <vms14> actually the whole world goes so wrong because the love of money (and power)
[04:26:37] <vms14> people kill and hate each other because of money
[04:27:41] <vms14> and even worse, when you expect to have something you won't be happy unless you have it
[04:28:00] <vms14> which means all the time you don't have it you'll be unhappy
[04:28:39] <vms14> better is to learn to live without what you're expecting as you don't even know it that thing will come
[04:29:05] <vms14> then you can enjoy the other things you discarted because you wanted another stuff
[04:29:44] <vms14> if you want to pursue something, pursue honesty
[04:31:16] <neominimum> It comes down to mindset. If money is seen as a utility that has it's own costs, then one can be content with having money. If one sees money as a source of endless happiness then it is a trap.

[05:01:02] <vms14> but a bit different
[05:01:43] <vms14> the question was like: you have to choose to kill your son or a much larger group of random people you don't know about
[05:02:20] <vms14> usually people preferred to kill the random ones, but people who had some mind troubles chose to kill their child instead
[05:03:02] <vms14> which is the most logic option, but not the best sentimental one

[22:36:34] <gilberth> shka: Heh, not my type of wemen.
[22:36:42] <gilberth> * woman
[22:37:39] <gilberth> shka: Sure. But I'm trapped kinda.
[22:38:26] <gilberth> For I would need to go outside and try to chat to people. That sort of things.
[22:38:41] <shka> well, what do you have instead, a backyard?
[22:39:09] <gilberth> shka: But otherwise, very beautiful song. You're a master DJ. I'd hire you. :-)

[22:39:41] <shka> gilberth: well, i am sucker for smooth female vocals
[22:39:42] <gilberth> shka: Heh, we have a backyard, but there are no people to meet there. Last time I checked. :-)
[22:39:43] <shka> what can i say
[22:40:20] <shka> gilberth: it's almost spring, learn how to plant flowers and veggies 
[22:40:38] <shka> it is shockingly relaxing
[22:40:48] <gilberth> Me? Plants? Do you want to kill all vegetation around here?
[22:40:56] <shka> you will be fine
[22:41:30] <shka> gardening is not that difficult and homegrown garlic tastes WAY better 
[22:41:56] <shka> but actually growing garlic is not-trivial actually
[22:41:57] <gilberth> Garlic? You suggest garlic to a vampire?

[22:42:25] <shka> don't tell me that that this myth is true :P
[22:42:45] <gilberth> shka: Sure. But when there is one thing that I hate with passion: it is garden chores and gardening.
[22:43:24] <shka> well, it is a kind of challenge, but you have a lot of free time

[22:43:37] <gilberth> Number one condition on getting the other evil house was that my wife agreed to care for the garden. Well, didn't work, she moved out.
[22:43:41] <shka> and you really could use some fresh air and sunlight
[22:44:09] <gilberth> shka: Sunlight? Do you want to kill me? I'll turn to dust.
[22:45:53] <gilberth> shka: I miss being on the golf course and I miss dancing. And walks at the beach at windy weather. We once were on vacation to Danmark's North Sea coast in Novemeber, that was a nice time.
[22:49:47] <shka> well, whatever floats your boat my friend
[22:50:29] <shka> i, in the meantime, will watch jeadong owning people in broodwar and how for lack of nuclear apocalypse 
[22:51:10] <gilberth> idk. I need to be patient with my health and I need to get used to do activities on my own. I mean, I could hit the golf course alone, can't I. Actually I did often in the past.
[22:51:42] <shka> gilberth: can't you simply put on a podcast and exercise?
[22:52:35] <gilberth> Exercise? That is your third assassination attempt!
[22:53:08] <shka> well, to be fair you seem to have autodestructive tendencies already ;-)
[22:53:11] <shka> cya!
[22:53:24] <gilberth> And btw doctor said I shouldn't exercise. Do walks, sure. But no exercise.
[22:53:53] <gilberth> shka: See you. Take care.
