[00:00:22] <MootPoot> Bco1981: strangely enough there no longer seems to be a price premium for 144hz at 1080p and 1440p
[00:00:26] <MootPoot> only at 4k

[00:01:10] <MootPoot> yeah mine is the 950

[00:01:35] <MootPoot> Only issue is some weird hibernation bug I got
[00:01:39] <MootPoot> a while ago
[00:01:44] <Bco1981> ah, i was looking at the 34" earlier... but... i don't have space for it
[00:01:45] <Cryowolf> dont suppose either of you know of a good bedtable? Similar to the ones used in hospitals but cheaper, still sturdy enough and under 60 euro. Big enough for a keyboard and mousepad
[00:02:09] <Bco1981> nope.
[00:02:11] <MootPoot> If I let the monitor go to sleep, I had to pull the power cable to the monitor to turn it back on
[00:02:27] <MootPoot> but then it somehow fixed itself so I guess it was a PC problem - not giving a wakeup signal
[00:02:56] <MootPoot> getting my first ever samsung monitor - I hear they look very different 
[00:02:59] <Bco1981> MootPoot: oh... interesting. when the rpi is on my daughters new LG monitor on hdmi when the screen sleeps it did not turn back on again...
[00:03:00] <MootPoot> much better colors
[00:03:17] <ButterNoodle> yea thanks for that ventoy

[00:03:28] <MootPoot> ventoy is really handy

[00:03:34] <ButterNoodle> yep
[00:03:37] <MootPoot> 3rd hand 4th cock
[00:03:38] <ButterNoodle> testing it out
[00:03:57] <MootPoot> sucks it only works on x86
[00:04:00] <MootPoot> but whatever
[00:04:03] <ButterNoodle> oh
[00:04:06] <ButterNoodle> ig
[00:04:11] <Cryowolf> displayport works best for this one imo
[00:04:16] <MootPoot> ARM stuff is really finicky as it is ]
[00:04:27] <MootPoot> no bootloader or BIOS or something on ARM
[00:04:27] <ButterNoodle> fuck arm
[00:04:34] <MootPoot> I wanna fuck a cute arm
[00:04:36] <Bco1981> Cryowolf: yeah, but i'm abusing my daughters monitor when she isn't here for my rpi4
[00:04:42] <ButterNoodle> I fuck my own arm
[00:04:47] <ButterNoodle> at least 2x a day
[00:05:12] <MootPoot> I really wish they fixed that at some point
[00:05:13] <Bco1981> i have fucked me arms for the next two days.
[00:05:16] <MootPoot> a proper ARM bootloader
[00:05:23] <ButterNoodle> y tho
[00:06:02] <MootPoot> easier to just install any ARM OS on any ARM board
[00:06:07] <MootPoot> like with x86
[00:06:22] <MootPoot> rahter then making specific OS changes to accomodate a particular board
[00:07:02] <MootPoot> I'm not 100% literate on the topic but afaik that's why you cant just install like, raspbian or firefox OS on any phone
[00:07:08] <MootPoot> or on any ARM dev board
[00:07:16] <MootPoot> they have to be tailored for each board
[00:07:47] <MootPoot> seems like the gtx 1050 can handle 1440p 144hz
[00:07:55] <MootPoot> for desktop use
[00:07:56] <MootPoot> all I need
[00:08:11] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: u need some good monitors
[00:09:12] <ButterNoodle> naa
[00:09:23] <ButterNoodle> 1080 144hz is fine

[02:37:49] <Nanobot> My diet is working. How do I stop?
[02:38:35] <Nanobot> In the last three days, I've had three SlimFasts, a granola bar, a couple spoonfuls of mac & cheese, and a few bites of a hot pocket.
[02:38:36] <JesseDesu> Bco1981, Urchin[emacs] 
[02:38:45] <Bco1981> once you hit 30, it's not diet... diet is temporary. it's a life style.

[02:39:15] <Bco1981> that's that yuri one the other day ?
[02:39:21] <JesseDesu> i bought a reciprocating saw

[02:39:28] <Nanobot> My legs are shaky, my voice isn't working right, and I've lost 8 pounds in three days.
[02:39:32] <JesseDesu> yes Bco1981 
[02:39:37] <Nanobot> And I had a fever.
[02:40:11] <Bco1981> Nanobot: ah, sure hope that's not a life style.
[02:40:37] <Nanobot> This wasn't intentional. I mean... I've been meaning to lose weight for a long time, but not like this.

[02:41:23] <ImoutoBot> [title] The Matrix, not like this... - YouTube
[02:41:42] <Bco1981> problem is, after, those pounds usually come back...
[02:43:10] <Nanobot> There's roughly a 10-pound swing when starting/stopping a diet. When you start eating fewer calories, your body starts holding less water, which amounts to around 10 pounds. When you stop your diet, your body begins holding that water again, so you gain 10 pounds.
[02:44:02] <JesseDesu> so theres an OTE zone for dieting too?
[02:44:34] <Nanobot> That's why there are so many diet plans that advertise that you can lose 10 pounds in x weeks. That's just the first x weeks; you don't lose it that fast afterward, and it comes back when you stop.
[02:45:35] <Nanobot> I might be able to finish this hot pocket. Maybe.

[13:24:39] <darkwitch> yes, that
[13:24:51] <Bco1981> ah, so it was blood.
[13:25:55] <darkwitch> the word is very similar to "blood" but it seems to mean "sacrifice"
[13:26:08] <MootPoot> Bco1981: had a interesting experience today
[13:26:22] <Bco1981> darkwitch: yeah animal sacrifice
[13:26:23] <MootPoot> two cars - one needed jump starting in -40C
[13:26:36] <Bco1981> darkwitch: offering to the gods
[13:26:42] <MootPoot> the dead car was blocking the good car so jumper cables didnt reach
[13:26:43] <darkwitch> then then spraying blood on people
[13:26:47] <MootPoot> ended up reaching one cable to another
[13:26:52] <Bco1981> MootPoot: damn
[13:27:05] <MootPoot> I got 7/11 delivery for jumper cables lol
[13:27:17] <MootPoot> and hooked up those cables to other cables
[13:27:30] <MootPoot> and then it took like an hour of leaving them connected to start it
[13:28:15] <JesseDesu> i have a battery pack in my backpack so i never have to ask anyone when that happens to me and my bike
[13:28:45] <Bco1981> wow... i would have thought since -40 isn't new to you moosepeople that you would have come up with better methods. to prevent cars from not starting.
[13:29:09] <MootPoot> we do use block heaters and trickle chargers
[13:29:15] <MootPoot> and they work like 99% of the time
[13:29:24] <MootPoot> its just that I only have one car so I didnt have a extra for the other one

[13:54:47] <MootPoot> is it?
[13:54:51] <amigojapan> Yes
[13:54:55] <MootPoot> calorie counting is part of every diet
[13:55:04] <amigojapan> No
[13:55:17] <MootPoot> tbh calorie counting isent even a diet really - its just a thing that should be your default
[13:55:30] <MootPoot> the japanese interpetiation of what a diet is weird
[13:55:37] <darkwitch> amigojapan, reunion? it was a bit different than that. two old people in the family died not that long before christmas
[13:55:37] <amigojapan> Keto you can eat as many calories as you wish as long as they are not carbs or sugar
[13:55:47] <MootPoot> thats...not true
[13:56:08] <amigojapan> Ouch sorry about that darkwitch 
[13:56:11] <darkwitch> we did not die to meet them for a reunion
[13:56:25] <MootPoot> if you eat a whole jar of mayo of like 4000-5000 cal a day, you're going to gain weight even if you are on keto ( and get sick )
[13:57:03] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you can eat a stick of butter and still lose weight
[13:57:25] <MootPoot> depending on the size of the butter*
[13:57:38] <MootPoot> ultimately its all still calories out have to be more then calories in
[13:57:45] <MootPoot> keto just makes it easier to maintain ^
[13:57:47] <amigojapan> Butter sticks are pretty standard
[13:57:54] <darkwitch> for a long time I thought the mayo clinic had something to do with mayo(nnaise)

[13:58:23] <darkwitch> maybe they actually do

[14:11:23] <MootPoot> :(
[14:20:17] <HeTo> I feel like the video didn't explicitly answer the question in the title, but I gather it's for connecting flights
[14:22:42] <MootPoot> well - its just that rail isen't viable enough yet
[14:22:51] <MootPoot> or built out, and both are major airports
[14:23:08] <MootPoot> and people dont like driving 3 hours - especially if you're alone
[14:23:22] <MootPoot> it costs the same to fly as to drive if you have a truck here
[14:23:56] <MootPoot> or, well it used to before covid
[14:24:43] *** Suzuka sets mode: -b *!anton@user/anton$##anime-help
[14:27:14] <MootPoot> google now says its like 300 round trip
[14:27:25] <MootPoot> I remember back in 2018 or 19 I paid like 70 one way
[14:29:10] <HeTo> oh, people fly the distance even to just get from one city to the other without intention of onward travel?
[14:29:21] <MootPoot> pretty much
[14:29:25] <MootPoot> both are major cities
[14:29:49] <MootPoot> before I had my own car and the prices skyrocketed because of the rona
[14:29:59] <HeTo> right, but the time saving over driving is close to nonexistent
[14:29:59] <MootPoot> I used to just take the twin engine prop planes down
[14:30:16] <MootPoot> is it?
[14:30:22] <MootPoot> is about a 1hr flight
[14:30:30] <HeTo> when you consider you have to be at the airport well before the flight leaves and you have to get to and from the airport too
[14:30:36] <MootPoot> there is basically no security on these flights, they dont even give a shit
[14:30:47] <MootPoot> so the airport time overhead is minimal really
[14:30:52] <amigojapan> 7:39 PM <darkwitch> you cut it coffee?<---it seems so
[14:31:18] <MootPoot> last time I went in 2019 I showed up at the airport like 15m before my flight and got there with time to spare
[14:31:19] <darkwitch> does it mean you stopped drinking coffee?
[14:31:58] <amigojapan> darkwitch: right. Tomako was not happy with any method of drinking coffee I tried
[14:32:00] <MootPoot> HeTo: these days bus tickets are the cheapest, the bus shut down but a different company started it up
[14:32:07] <MootPoot> I think its like 100-120 for a trip
[14:32:26] <MootPoot> if you have a small car then you can drive yourself for like 20-25 dollars in gas

[14:34:22] <MootPoot> lol
[14:35:06] <darkwitch> anton has been a naughty boy
[14:35:16] <amigojapan> MootPoot: cause we have a limit of people we can keep on the ban list
[14:35:21] <HeTo> MootPoot: really? usually the boarding ends 20 minutes before the flight. and you need to get through security before that, as well as drop the bag if you have drop-off baggage
[14:35:39] <MootPoot> HeTo: that's only for international flights
[14:35:46] <MootPoot> local flights here are super lax
[14:36:10] <MootPoot> walk through one metal detector, show your ticket, if you have luggage they might ask, usually they dont and you're done
[14:37:37] <amigojapan> I have hardly taken any local flights
[14:37:56] <amigojapan> Just a couple of times in the US
[14:37:57] <MootPoot> yeah, lucky for you living in a small, densly populated country
[14:38:10] <MootPoot> our entire rail lines are basically just heavy cargo
[14:38:20] <HeTo> Japan is hardly small though

[14:39:38] <amigojapan> Japan is long and thin
[14:40:40] <MootPoot> !c 9984670/377930
[14:40:41] <ImoutoBot> MootPoot: 26.41936337416982
[14:40:54] <MootPoot> seems like canada is almost 26 times as big as japan
[14:41:27] <HeTo> from one end of Ky√ªsy√ª to the other end of Hokkaid√¥ it's about the same distance as San Francisco to Edmonton, and that's ignoring Okinawa and other far-flung islands
[14:41:36] <amigojapan> Canada is an especially big country
[14:42:04] <HeTo> and Japan being so thin gets especially long distances for a country of its area
[14:42:20] <MootPoot> japan being thin helps it out a lot in terms of transit
[14:42:32] <MootPoot> since you only really need to build transit north to south
[14:42:57] <HeTo> well, you have the same advantage in Canada
[14:43:04] <MootPoot> how so
[14:43:16] <MootPoot> we're spread out in all angles
[14:43:17] <darkwitch> san francisco was not in canada the last time I checked
[14:43:18] <HeTo> 90 % of the population lives within a hundred miles from the US or something
[14:43:32] <MootPoot> sure, but that's only good for that 90% 
[14:43:49] <MootPoot> actually, wait
[14:43:49] <amigojapan> Poor saint Francis
[14:44:17] <MootPoot> its spread out horizontally like that, but the population and the density is still not enough to make trains work along the border like that
[14:44:23] <MootPoot> unlike japan
[14:44:56] <MootPoot> google san says japan has 3x the population
[14:45:28] <amigojapan> MootPoot: but it costs 700usd round trip from here by train to Hokkaido
[14:45:37] <MootPoot> expensive
[14:45:54] <amigojapan> Yup flying is cheaper
[14:46:31] <HeTo> you can get it more cheaply as a foreigner if you don't intend staying too long. just get one of those JR passes
[14:47:02] <MootPoot> trains are a bit weird in that they have really high minimum costs
[14:47:18] <HeTo> although you don't get access to the very fastest shinkansen, but you do get access to the slower shinkansen
[14:47:20] <amigojapan> HeTo: you can't get it as a permanent resident like me
[14:47:42] <HeTo> heck, even 21-day pass is cheaper than that
[14:47:42] <darkwitch> you're not even allowed to enter japan right now
[14:47:50] <HeTo> amigojapan: right, you're not foreigner enough
[14:48:19] <amigojapan> I am HeTo 
[14:48:33] <amigojapan> I am just a permanent resident
[14:49:00] <MootPoot> keeping a plane on the ground and not using it is cheaper then keeping a entire train track maintained
[14:49:05] <amigojapan> That's right darkwitch 
[14:49:10] <MootPoot> trains are weird like that - they are endgame scalers
[14:49:37] <MootPoot> amigojapan: does the japaanese govt subsidize the rail system
[14:49:54] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it's private
[14:49:54] *** Quits: Thymo (~Thymo@NASSP/developer/Thymo) (Quit: ZNC - http://znc.in)
[14:50:11] <MootPoot> yeah, but you can still subsidize private businesses
[14:50:16] <MootPoot> like corn farming in the US
[14:50:18] <amigojapan> MootPoot: they privatized it in the 80s
[14:50:57] <amigojapan> MootPoot: ok then I am not sure

[14:55:27] <amigojapan> MootPoot: Google says "The privatized rail network in Japan¬†requires few subsidies. The three biggest companies, JR East, JR Central and JR-West (which account for 60% of the passenger market) receive no state subsidy.
[14:56:47] <MootPoot> sounds about right
[14:57:13] <MootPoot> completely unsubsidized rail is really hard to achive
[14:57:22] <MootPoot> and you would have to ignore all the small towns
[14:57:46] <HeTo> especially if you have to compete against 100 % subsidized roads
[14:58:00] <amigojapan> MootPoot: in Tokyo there are several train companies
[14:59:18] <amigojapan> MootPoot: it is just seamless cause the suica card is accepted by all of them
[15:00:02] <MootPoot> I wonder how much it costs to send a letter from me to amigo
[15:00:56] <amigojapan> Probably cheaper for me than for you. At least that is how it was to become
[15:01:13] <amigojapan> To Mexico*
[15:01:32] <MootPoot> the canada post website says 2.71
[15:01:42] <MootPoot> for upto 30g or 5 sheets of paper
[15:01:52] <MootPoot> or between 30 to 50 is 3.88

[15:12:14] <MootPoot> amigojapan: it seems that google flights now posts carbon output on their flights as well
[15:12:22] <MootPoot> so you know how much CO2 your flight will take
[15:13:28] <amigojapan> MootPoot: from Tokyo to Hokkaido you mean?
[15:13:42] <MootPoot> I mean for any flight you look at 
[15:14:00] <MootPoot> amigojapan: try searching "tokyo to hong kong flights" on google flights
[15:14:09] <MootPoot> and there will be a column for CO2
[15:14:51] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I don't know how much is much tho
[15:15:22] <MootPoot> idk -  maybe just compare it by relativity
[15:16:24] <Sadale> If I have to take a flight, I have to take a flight. No point showing CO2 footprint for a flight
[15:16:34] <MootPoot> eh, not really
[15:17:18] <Sadale> Makes me wonder what's the ulterior motive of Google doing that. Maybe it just wants to get people discuss about it?
[15:17:36] <MootPoot> why is there always a ulterior motive with you
[15:17:36] <Sadale> So that poeple would say that "oh google is a green company! It's good! Yandex is less green and it's EVIL!"
[15:17:53] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I don't see the carbon climb on my phone
[15:17:53] <Sadale> Because capitalism. It takes money for Google to implement such a feature :P
[15:18:09] <Sadale> Google won't do shit if it doesn't believe that it's benefitial to themselves.

[15:18:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, I don't think you want to take it tho
[15:18:40] <MootPoot> Sadale: what if you needed to go from say HK to japan, and then it told you it would cost the same amount of money but if you took a ferry it would use 1/6 of the carbon output
[15:18:49] <Sadale> pffffffffffft

[15:24:11] <Sadale> MootPoot, I'm surprised. I thought that any boat were slow af because surface shipping to the US takes like 3 months to get delivered. Meanwhile, air shipping only take a couple of weeks.

[15:32:30] <davic> As of 1 January 2021, businesses are no longer able to use the UK‚Äôs MOSS scheme to report and pay VAT on sales of digital services to consumers in the EU. Businesses that sell digital services to consumers in the EU have to register for the MOSS non-union scheme in one of the remaining 27 EU member states.
[15:32:34] <davic> cunt
[15:32:44] <Sadale> Just don't pay for the VAT then \o/
[15:32:48] <davic> Under the non-union MOSS scheme, businesses wishing to use the scheme must register by the 10th day of the month following a sale. For example, if you make your first affected sale in June 2021 you will need to register by 10 July 2021. Alternatively, a business can register for VAT in each EU member state where sales are made.
[15:32:56] <davic> Sadale: nah, still have to pay it if I bill it
[15:32:59] <Sadale> It isn't that you don't want to pay for it. It's just that you can't pay for it

[17:37:08] <Sapphirus> isekaijin, or is it because every iteration of Windows is worse than the last since Windows 8?

[17:47:37] <Sapphirus> Linux in general is great if you can navigate the command line and read documentation. Not everyone can do that, so.
[17:48:21] <MootPoot> Sapphirus: I heavily disagree
[17:48:26] <Bco1981> the problem is, you need to read too f'ing much.

[17:48:45] <MootPoot> 11, not really, I get your point
[17:48:57] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, it's Windows 8 with Windows 7 lipstick
[17:49:25] <MootPoot> sure, I dont see why that's bad
[17:49:35] <Sapphirus> Microsoft didn't stop being openly hostile to users who wished to have control over their systems.
[17:49:51] <Sapphirus> UI looked like it was designed with powerpoint
[17:49:53] <Bco1981> windows 8.1 pro works perfectly
[17:50:03] <MootPoot> the issue with 8 was the shit design
[17:50:06] <MootPoot> and interface
[17:50:27] <Sapphirus> Windows 10 still has that shit design and interface, except the menu doesn't go full screen.
[17:51:06] <Bco1981> fucking finally, after 187MB libs and 3 additional libs i can finally play doom on my rpi
[17:51:18] <MootPoot> aside from the search menu and control panels I dont  really have any complaints with the win10 UI
[17:51:38] <Sapphirus> 8.1 is probably the last version of Windows which can have the bullshit reliably modded out.
[17:53:10] <Sapphirus> MootPoot, well, it throws everything about UI design out the window. They can't even competently design a flat interface with proper element delineation.
[17:54:12] <Bco1981> they really shouldn't try and mix tablet interface with a desktop product.
[17:54:25] <Sapphirus> That, too.
[17:56:50] <Sapphirus> When you can't tell the difference between elements, that becomes very confusing to people who aren't computer literate.
[17:59:22] <Sapphirus> Desktop PCs aren't mobile phones.
[18:01:05] <Sapphirus> Microsoft has largely thrown several decades worth of Human Interface design out the window.
[18:01:47] <MootPoot> I do agree
[18:01:59] <isekaijin> Seriously, I miss the fact that 90's era Microsoft at least cared about power users.
[18:02:06] <MootPoot> for UI tbh aside from apple  I havent encountered anyone else good
[18:02:27] <MootPoot> FOSS stuff tends to have shit UI as well
[18:02:38] <MootPoot> and apple , the UI is good but they dont cater to power user style UI
[18:03:00] <MootPoot> so mostly your choice is just shit FOSS UI which makes you just go back to the cli every 5 min
[18:03:21] <isekaijin> macOS is visually pretty, but 90's era Windows looked good enough.
[18:04:55] <Sapphirus> FOSS stuff has a lot more consistency between toolkits than the amalgamation of a dozen different paradigms on Windows today.
[18:05:18] <MootPoot> on windows there's basically just three though
[18:05:24] <Sapphirus> I honestly can hardly tell the difference between QT and GTK applications running on my system.
[18:05:41] <MootPoot> the old menus from win98 and stuff, the new tile crap, and the windows 7/vista main UI
[18:05:42] <Sapphirus> Unless the GTK applications are using CSD-oriented design.

[18:06:38] <isekaijin> The ‚Äúproblem‚Äù with Qt and GTK is simply that there are so many programmers who can barely learn JavaScript, and learning C or C++ is completely out of the question.
[18:06:56] <Sapphirus> Three + whatever else Microsoft comes up with and drops this year, the last, and so on.
[18:07:59] <Sapphirus> Complexity of Qt is also daunting. It was far easier to write a hello world application with GTK than it was Qt.
[18:08:14] <Sapphirus> That was from my limited experience in trying out rust.
[18:10:11] <isekaijin> Well, yes, Qt is very complex. But there are less complicated UI toolkits that don't rely on putting everything inside a web browser instance.

[20:51:10] <Roey> hmm
[20:51:14] <Roey> that's a yum option actually

[20:51:42] <Roey> dpkg -S <filename>
[20:51:57] <MootPoot> Bco1981_2:  I did it!
[20:52:00] <Roey> Type the following command to find out what package provides /usr/bin/passwd file:
[20:52:00] <Roey> dpkg -S /usr/bin/passwd
[20:52:02] <MootPoot> or is it Bco1981 
[20:52:11] <Roey> the former
[20:52:23] * Roey congratulations on MootPoot on doing what he did.

[20:52:52] <Bco1981> this looks like it only shows files you already have, and what package they belong to.
[20:53:05] <MootPoot> I sorted all my JAVs
[20:53:05] <Bco1981> i need to find what package i need to install that has fil libxxx.so
[20:53:14] <MootPoot> I deleted like 2.5TB of stuff
[20:53:17] <Bco1981> MootPoot: wow
[20:53:53] <Bco1981> Roey: and apt-file does that
[20:54:05] <Poeticode> feels naisu to unlink tons of file pointers
[20:54:09] <MootPoot> surprising- I thought I already had a curated collection but then when I actually looked into it, comparing them relatively rather then one at a time, a lot of them are just not worth keeping
[20:55:21] <isekaijin> ‚Äúsudo pacman -F /usr/lib/libopcodes.so‚Äù --> ‚Äúusr/lib/opcodes.so is owned by core/binutils 2.36.1-3‚Äù
[20:55:49] <isekaijin> How common is it to have to look which package owns a file, though?
[20:55:57] <isekaijin> Do you really not know what software you install?
[20:56:47] <Bco1981_2> isekaijin, today, i wanted to install zandronum a optimized doom engine on my rpi.
[20:58:09] <Bco1981_2> isekaijin, first i needed libxcursor1, libopenal1, libsdl1.2:armhf, libjpeg62-turbo, libmpg123-0:armhf to make doom work
[20:58:34] <Bco1981_2> all i got was it complained about some lib was missing

[20:59:31] <Bco1981_2> it complained about a new missing lib after each package was installed
[21:02:42] <isekaijin> You first check what libraries you need, you install those dependencies, and only then do you install your program.
[21:03:17] <isekaijin> Package managers have made users really soft.
[21:03:17] <Bco1981_2> i don't have that option. using PiKISS

[21:53:50] <Bco1981> i just needed it to make dosbox-x work on 64bit raspberry pi os
[21:53:56] <Bco1981> needed 7 libs to install
[21:54:10] <Roey> what's your use-case for your rpi?  
[21:54:18] <Bco1981> messing around
[21:54:23] <Roey> I'm lookikng for  use case for those for myself 
[21:54:32] <Roey> like, esp. the Pico
[21:54:32] <Bco1981> pushing it to it's limits
[21:54:44] <Roey> which I suppose I can use other boards that are faster/same size
[21:54:48] <Roey> with a different chip 
[21:54:51] <Roey> like esp32
[21:55:21] <Roey> bco1981: yeah, I hear you on that.  It's what got me interested in looking up info on operatnig systems for microcontrollers
[21:55:23] <Roey> like the Pico
[21:55:34] <Bco1981> yeah i heard about that from a co-worker. but, feels too close to "just" a microchip then a SoC.
[21:55:39] <Roey> (Virtux and FreeRTOS)
[21:55:42] <Roey> non
[21:55:44] <Roey> Fuzix
[21:55:45] <Roey> I think

[21:57:22] <Roey> so there's two cores, how do you use two, if you don't have something to manage the computational load?
[21:57:28] <Roey> the second core goes unused
[21:57:31] <Roey> (rp2040, say)
[21:57:48] <Roey> at least, if there were an OS, then it could manage the processes transparently
[21:58:35] <Roey> question is just how much can they shove, technologically, so that it comes out to retail at $4
[21:58:53] <Roey> *how much tech they can shove in that package
[21:59:13] <Roey> there are competitors that also have wifi and usb
[21:59:26] <Roey> and they cost $10, not $4 like the Raspberry Pi Pico.
