[00:01:15] <jwpapi> I can’t think of a smooth way of writing these const that have 2 cases https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Xw4SBOjr/
[00:01:53] <jwpapi> I know I could do: `const response = (entity === 'skills-pro`) ? …` but for clarity I would like showcase both cases
[00:02:05] <qswz> switch?
[00:02:06] <jwpapi> But also I don’t think it should be a function
[00:02:21] <jwpapi> qswz: switch seems so bulky
[00:02:39] <qswz> not with retur
[00:02:41] <qswz> n*
[00:03:03] <sheetjs> jwpapi: depends on what you mean by "showcase
[00:03:08] <qswz> makes code clear
[00:03:46] <sheetjs> const response = () => fetch(`/api/google/adwords${entity === 'skills-pro' && 'SkillsPro'}`)
[00:04:44] <sheetjs> const response = () => fetch(`/api/google/adwords${entity === 'skills-pro' && 'SkillsPro' || ""}`)
[00:04:56] <jwpapi> that’s bulky to me https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/NX09tuaS/
[00:05:04] <qswz> switch will be clearer imo
[00:05:25] <jwpapi> and my code is wrong even I think
[00:05:27] <qswz> jwpapi: no don't put the break
[00:05:31] <systemfault> You can use an object
[00:05:34] <sheetjs> depends on your goal
[00:05:39] <qswz> just return from each cse
[00:05:59] <qswz> yea object is the other good alternative
[00:06:01] <sheetjs> there's some threshold where object is better than switch

[00:57:39] <jwpapi> I think in general in development period it’s great to throw a lot of errors, so you’ll always find fast what’s wrong and when you feel like you’re ready for production you just set up proper error handling and don’t break the whole program if something fails

[01:27:16] <jwpapi> `throw new Error(`not valid entity`) is missing name and and stack or?
[01:27:31] <hax> tried dotenv-webpack but only getting undefined for my keys, and process.env returns MISSING_ENV_VAR
[01:27:41] <ash_worksi> is there such a thing in chai as `foo.someMethod('argment').should.be.called()` ?
[01:27:43] <jwpapi> hax: why do you want to have env vars in React. the whole point of them is not having them there
[01:27:54] <jwpapi> *not in frontend

[01:28:13] <hax> seems a pretty obvious case
[01:28:23] <jwpapi> hax: you don’t have to define an url in `.env`
[01:28:41] <jwpapi> I use `.env` for secret variables
[01:28:51] <hax> server side, so do I
[01:29:02] <hax> but the url changes based on environment
[01:29:08] <jwpapi> If you make process.env available in frontend everybody can see your keys.
[01:29:45] <jwpapi> Then maybe just don’t store the url in `.env` as it’s not needed, but best to give us some code
[01:29:52] <jwpapi> but no the content of `process.env`
[01:30:09] <hax> which is why CRA filters to REACT_APP_* but that doesn't work either. I understand the concerns. I don't see an obvious solution to an obvious case where it could be used

[03:31:01] <hax> The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. But to do what you said, Array.reduce is correct. Start with {} as your default (last option)

[03:33:34] <ljharb> that's tiny
[03:33:38] <ljharb> z1haze: the modern way to do it is with flatMap, as i said.
[03:33:52] <z1haze> oh, well if thats tiny, alrighty then

[03:42:18] <ljharb> hax: getify's advice is mostly good but the rest is actually a bad practice, like "it's ok to use var" or "it's ok to use =="
[03:42:30] <ljharb> hax: why would you use Object.create in the first place? i can only think of "null objects" or "inheritance"
[03:42:37] <ljharb> for inheritance, only use `class`, or better, don't use inheritance at all
[03:42:42] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@c-65-96-171-157.hsd1.ma.comcast.net)
[03:43:00] <ljharb> for null objects, `{ __proto__: null }` is ugly but it's also impossible to break, whereas `delete Object.create` can break the alternative
[03:43:08] <ljharb> hax: do you have any other use case?
[03:43:21] <ljharb> z1haze: the reason is what you just asked for. where you'd normally have to filter + map or map + filter, now you can flatMap.
[03:43:40] <ljharb> z1haze: it takes 2 proper operations (filter and map, in either order) and condenses them cleanly into one iteration.
[03:43:54] <ljharb> without needing reduce, which is rarely a clear way to solve problems
[03:44:15] <systemfault> reduce has the same problem as the "for loop", it's too powerful

[03:50:33] <ljharb> hax: you should always use the highest-level thing, not the lowest-level.
[03:51:07] <ljharb> inheritance that doesn't use `class` is almost certainly broken, often in small, subtle ways.

[03:53:35] <hax> class is just hiding the reality of inheritance. we can agree to disagree.
[03:53:44] <ljharb> hax: yes, that is the entire point of abstractions
[03:53:50] <ljharb> it SHOULD be hidden, because you shouldn't be thinking about it

[03:54:11] <ljharb> and since `class` does many more things than just the [[Prototype]] setup on instances - which is the only part Object.create does - it's a better choice.
[03:54:29] <ljharb> a proper subclass C or parent class P also means that C *itself* inherits from P

[03:54:39] <hax> ljharb, but it's a confused abstraction by using what appears to be the same syntax from other classical inheritance languages
[03:54:41] <ljharb> that's just one major way.
[03:54:49] <ljharb> hax: yes, i agree that the name "class" sucks
[03:55:00] <ljharb> hax: but the construct is objectively superior by such a large degree that the name doesn't matter
[03:55:13] <ljharb> if i was on the committee a few years earlier it wouldn't be named `class`, that's for sure

[04:42:15] <z1haze> all of their deaths are listed in that 2.5M array

[04:45:10] <z1haze> eg i want to count the number of deaths and kills for each user and display them. All of a user's deaths/kills are all in a single table of deaths, where there is a victim field and an attacker field. depend on which has their user id, determines if its a death or kill

[04:46:18] <z1haze> there has to be a way to efficiently tally up kills/deaths per user. would it be faster to just do a new sql query per user?
[04:46:33] <z1haze> i figured that would be less efficient which is why i first query for all users and then iterate over them
[04:47:18] <ashnur> i don't really understand what's going on, but the way to make big computations faster is to either avoid doing the work or cache it and do it in increments as new data comes in
[04:47:54] <z1haze> the plan is going to be to cache it

[09:38:23] <jellobot> pagnol, Promises are placeholders for values that'll be provided in the future. They allow composing asynchronous operations like synchronous ones. See http://robotlolita.me/2015/11/15/how-do-promises-work.html and https://blog.domenic.me/youre-missing-the-point-of-promises/. Contrast with !cps & see https://bevacqua.github.io/promisees/.

[11:32:55] <ljharb> `browser.runtime.sendMessage` is the superpowered extension part.
[11:33:18] <ljharb> ok so basically it's just heavily obfuscated

[11:36:58] <ammarsalmi> Glad it's not something that serious. They are probably just sniffing data and sending it to a server somewhere.
[11:37:45] <ljharb> yeah

[11:58:56] <velix> When you post JSON to PHP, $_POST is empty.
[11:59:09] <velix> you have to process it using php://input
[11:59:14] <ljharb> sure, because json isn't a normal form post
[11:59:24] <velix> But php://input isn't working for "multipart/form-data"
[11:59:41] <ljharb> right, because multipart/form-data is a normal form post
[11:59:46] <ljharb> that's what $_POST is for.
[11:59:53] <velix> yeah. But there's no way to process multiple names in PHP  then ;)
[11:59:57] <ljharb> correct.
[11:59:58] <ljharb> nor should you
[12:00:05] <ljharb> because why would you be receiving any data from a form you didn't author?
[12:00:05] <velix> I also said to the frontend guy: DONT DO IT.
[12:00:12] <velix> He says: I don't care, it's standard.
[12:00:17] <ljharb> not if you're using php
[12:00:18] <velix> it's allowed, so fix your backend.
[12:00:23] <ljharb> velix: not possible.
[12:00:29] <velix> ljharb: yeah, he doesn't like PHP.
[12:00:32] <ljharb> velix: it's allowed, but it's also dirty and gross and he's incompetent for doing it
[12:00:33] <velix> he says, PHP is broken Perl.

[18:36:13] <lukaswilkeer> sorry stenno, i had to quit, the seconde argument is the current value being processed. the previous is and accumulator.

[18:38:46] <stenno> i am trying to come up with any data structure that makes sense here
[18:38:59] <stenno> lukaswilkeer: how does 'arr' look like before the reduce?
[18:39:55] <stenno> anyway, as i said, first step would be pulling the assignment from the reduce cb as the ssecond arg to reduce
[18:40:36] <stenno> arr.reduce((acc,cur,idx) => {acc.push(cur[index-1]); return acc;}, [])
[18:41:24] <stenno> so if arr looks like [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], in the first run, cur[index-1] will be undefined
[18:41:57] <stenno> paste to jsfiddle how your array looks like before reducing
[18:42:07] <lukaswilkeer> cause the previous value, the arr reduce presents this behaviour
[18:42:08] <stenno> because your current code doesn't make sense and it will actually break

[18:42:41] <stenno> lukaswilkeer: i know how .reduce works. you don't, apparently

[18:43:15] <stenno> and you also don't want to show me how your array looks like
[18:43:48] <lukaswilkeer> is an array of arrays

[20:37:23] <z1haze> all maps are key value pairs, its their underlying impmentation that determines their performance
[20:37:32] <stenno> indeed
[20:37:43] <z1haze> eg a hashmap, believe it or not is based on hashes, which offer a constant-time lookup functionality
[20:37:45] <austincheney> you guys are confusing Map objects for hash maps but they are different
[20:37:54] <ashnur> austincheney, why you think i don't know this? i even alluded to this fact in what i said.
[20:38:20] <stenno> the question was if a map has the same performance as a hash map, and you are saying that we are mixing up maps with hashmaps?
[20:38:22] <austincheney> ashnur, its hard to know where a conversation ends and begins on irc
[20:38:22] <z1haze> i just simply asked if a map in jhavascript works off hashes and has this performance benefit over an object

[20:39:02] <ashnur> austincheney, but what you assume doesn't have to be the minimum
[20:39:13] <d3x0r> yes it's hashed, but so are objects, and objects and maps are constantly saying they are the same

[20:40:51] <stenno> the lookup complexity of both objects and Maps are guaranteed to be at most O(log(n))
[20:41:35] <austincheney> z1haze, I imagine performance is the same between Maps and objects (hash maps), because it comes down to lookup by index.  Maps/objects are randomly access by key from memory opposed to an array which is accessed in index order from memory
[20:41:46] <austincheney> but you would need to run microbenchmark tests to confirm
[20:41:48] <stenno> the actual algorithm is implementation detail
[20:42:07] <stenno> so it might differ from engine to engine

[20:44:36] <stenno> it does not make sense to compare actual lookup speeds unless you want to compare engines
[20:44:47] <austincheney> the guy who first noticed the performance difference between maps and arrays and wrote a white paper about it was a guy named Paul Heckel in 1978

[22:18:56] <austincheney> ah ok, then it looks good
[22:18:57] <PenguinMan98> yo
[22:19:00] <austincheney> hello Intelo
[22:20:12] <austincheney> PenguinMan98, you are using the same argument names for both child process callbacks which will halt access to the stdout of the parent function from within the child function
[22:21:06] <Intelo> I am getting paranoid about 1) garbage, bloated, insecure etc libraries. For java world there apache for example that is reputed for its libs.  what are good choices in JS world? 2) long debate but things like material, kendo, bootstrap, react,   vs   things done from scratch. Any comments here? I know its a huge topic but any comments still?
[22:21:06] <PenguinMan98> ok
[22:21:10] <austincheney> also, don't worry about callback hell, because you can define your callback functions else where and then pass them to the exec call by reference:  let callback = () => {};exec("my thing", callback)

[22:22:55] <PenguinMan98> I remember one time somebody suggesting a website to me run by coders that culled npm for only those packages they'd personally reviewed and met certain standards.
[22:23:13] <austincheney> Intelo, the only time you ever NEED NPM packages are for vendor access to vendor external applications.  everything else is a developer convenience
[22:23:52] <Intelo> 4. can I make an npm private registery that has my own packages. and if I ask some other public package, it fetchs from the npm.com repo "through" my registery
[22:23:58] <Intelo> thats all the questions
[22:24:12] <austincheney> Intelo, yes private packages on npm are a thing
[22:24:23] <Intelo> austincheney not on npm. but my own registry
[22:24:33] <Intelo> self  hosted
[22:26:00] <austincheney> Intelo, configure client node/npm instances to point to your internal repo.  if the package is there on your internal repo then "npm install" will pull your private code before moving on to a higher level repo like the NPM public registry
[22:26:51] <Intelo> austincheney yes thats what I want. but what app / registery is that? that does this?
[22:27:03] <Intelo> where will be my internal repo?
[22:27:13] <silly> verdaccio for example
[22:27:14] <Intelo> what is exactly that internal repo?
[22:27:19] <Intelo> silly oh ok
[22:27:21] <Intelo> got it.
[22:27:30] <Intelo> silly austincheney so is that the good way to go?
[22:27:32] <austincheney> I have never set up an internal NPM registry, I imagine you could contact NPM staff about that because its a commerical service they charge for
[22:28:13] <silly> i thought, private repos on npm was what they charge for
[22:28:36] <austincheney> I could be wrong
[22:28:41] <silly> i mean private packages, oh private repos probably too
[22:28:47] <Intelo> austincheney Verdaccio is a simple, zero-config-required local private NPM registry. No need for an entire database just to get started. Verdaccio comes out of the box with its own tiny database, and the ability to proxy other registries (eg. npmjs.org), also introduces caching the downloaded modules along the way. For those who are looking to
[22:28:47] <Intelo> extend their storage capabilities, Verdaccio supports various community-made plugins to hook into services such as Amazon's S3, Google Cloud Storage or create your own plugin.

[22:42:26] <PenguinMan98> I wonder if I can generate it outside of the repo
[22:44:19] <Intelo> austincheney interesting. So you don't have any types inside the real code / app project. you keep them separately bundled?
[22:44:59] <Intelo> What are the most trusted and reputable npm package maintainers? airbnb is one I know?
[22:45:30] <austincheney> Intelo, i declare all my types in separate .d.ts files.  Those files can reside anywhere in your repo

[22:47:23] <PenguinMan98> OK, I have this far, but now it seems the build process isn't running
[22:47:31] <PenguinMan98> Or maybe it's async again
[22:47:42] <PenguinMan98> But no, the file I expected to be created wasn't created.
[22:48:03] <austincheney> Intelo, when it comes to NPM package trust most people trust what they are familiar with or what is most convenient to their task at hand, some people in the JS ecosystem are really good about dependency management, but it seems most developers don't care, hence bloat
[22:48:59] <austincheney> PenguinMan98, you might need to find somebody with more experience using gulp.  From the cursory 30 seconds I spent reading the gulp docs your code should work.
[22:49:12] <Intelo> austincheney so you never use some {object} as type or declare interface 'inside' your app?
[22:49:15] <PenguinMan98> Thank you
[22:50:22] <austincheney> Intelo, I declare all my types in .d.ts files, which I keep in one location, and then use I refer to them where I need them in the remainder of my application.

[23:55:13] <paule32> ehm no, i mean: i have a page, into this page a div, the content for this div comes from other file, then when i click on a "prev" button, i would load the old stuff, without reload the first page, and place the (old) htnl text into the (existing) div, then jump to a <a name="foo"

[23:57:34] <Intelo> stenno dam.. what happened to him?
[23:58:01] <stenno> ......check the link in the topic
[23:58:12] <d3x0r> paule32 in that case you just need to get the scrollTop (or Y) and use https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_scrollto.asp  window.scrollTo to go to the position (getClientRect will give it  the divs position)
[23:58:50] <d3x0r> or you can add an anchor to it...
[23:59:27] <paule32> ok thank you
