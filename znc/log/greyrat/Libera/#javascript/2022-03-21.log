[00:16:26] <blueagain> sheetjs: you do quite a lot of binary comparison stuff
[00:17:56] <sheetjs> by numbers, most of the file formats are pure binary data munging
[00:18:19] <sheetjs> by usage in the wild, it's probably 10% at most
[00:19:12] <sheetjs> which is a disappointment, because XLSB (the binary modern Excel format) is far superior to XLSX, but XLSX is easier to generate

[06:16:11] <systemfault> Maxdamantus: That changed?
[06:16:14] <Maxdamantus> The version of Go released a few days ago has generics, so you should be able to compose these things now.
[06:16:17] <blacked> I was looking to code via udemy, where every tutorial that tells `complete` are very incomplete
[06:16:24] <systemfault> Maxdamantus: Ah, fun :)
[06:16:28] <Maxdamantus> or at least, you could come up with some `Result<T>` abstraction that can be composed.
[06:16:51] <blacked> Maxdamantus what are generics in simple langauge with simple example ?
[06:17:07] <Maxdamantus> I haven't tried it, but I have considered lack of generics as the main reason why I wouldn't consider Go as a primary language for me.
[06:17:30] <systemfault> Maxdamantus: Same thing for me... it's unacceptable for a statically-typed language.

[06:18:59] <systemfault> blacked: Generics are "placeholders" for types, often used in cases like "containers" (Arrays/List/Queue/Stack/etc)
[06:19:06] <Maxdamantus> blacked: type parameters, so where you can create data structures that are parameterised over a type, eg `struct Foo<T> { bar int; baz T; }` and define functions that are also parameterised over a type, eg `fn qux<T>(foo Foo<T>): int { return foo.bar; }`

[06:21:39] <systemfault> Then, if you want to program, nearly any language is worth learning... Except maybe C and C++
[06:21:58] <systemfault> Learn those two if you KNOW what you want to do with them, especially C++ since it takes a lifetime to master.

[06:23:31] <blacked> :)
[06:24:00] <Maxdamantus> Given that current set of languages, I would indeed suggest learning something statically typed if you want to progress in understanding programming.
[06:25:45] <Maxdamantus> Relating to my previous comment, generics is only important in statically typed languages, since in dynamically typed languages like JS/Python, you can already write things with type parameters, because you don't need to write the types, but then you're not getting any guarantees that your imaginary uses of types are valid.
[06:26:00] *** Joins: thojanssens (~thojansse@49.230.83.198)
[06:28:02] <blacked> golang can be static and dynamic , so generics can be used or not , am i right?
[06:28:20] <Rockwood> o/
[06:29:04] <matsaman> would be pretty neat if they added generics after the fact and they couldn't not be used =P
[06:29:40] <Maxdamantus> Sort of. You can convert things to the static `interface{}` (now also known as `any`) type and then convert back, but that conversion back will be a dynamic type error if you mess up.

[06:30:44] <Maxdamantus> But that use of dynamic typing is at least explicit, and theoretically it should be less useful now that there is type parameterism.
[06:32:11] <Maxdamantus> I wrote a set of parser combinators in Go a long time ago, just because that's what I usually wrote when trying out a language, and it used `interface{}` everywhere, so there were lots of places where programming mistakes could lead to errors which would only be found at runtime rather than compile time.

[07:39:42] <theskillwithin> sheetjs wait is that saying deno takes longer?
[07:39:57] <sheetjs> yeah in the xml case its ~20x longer than node
[07:40:00] <Maxdamantus> Presumably because it's running the typechecker.
[07:40:02] <theskillwithin> sheetjs I thought because deno uses types, it somehow makes it faster,  idk iv never used deno
[07:40:22] <Maxdamantus> There's an option to disable type checking.
[07:40:24] <buu> I just want a v8 cli that doesn't spent 300ms spinning up useless threads
[07:40:29] <sheetjs> nah its some chunking issue https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/10157
[07:40:31] * Maxdamantus hasn't really used deno, so doesn't know the default behaviour.
[07:40:31] <buu> freaking node
[07:40:50] <sheetjs> speaking of node, it too suffered issues this weekend
[07:41:03] <buu> v8 is insanely fast to start and run code but node takes *forever* to start running code
[07:41:06] <buu> It's super annoying
[07:41:19] <sheetjs> n> var buf = Buffer.from({length:200e6},(_,i) => i%256); console.time("doit"); var ss = buf.toString("binary"); console.timeEnd("doit"); ss.length
[07:41:25] <jellobot> (timeout)
[07:41:31] <buu> Partly because it does a lot of potentially useless setup work loading libraries and launching event loops
[07:41:38] <sheetjs> https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/42407 try that in the repl and it crashes when you type ss.
[07:41:46] <buu> =O
[07:41:49] <buu> but why
[07:42:02] <sheetjs> there's an allocation failure in the v8 layer but it isn't properly surfaced
[07:42:13] <buu> ah
[07:42:24] <sheetjs> so the function returns early but it actually failed.  something about typing . forces a property access that fails
[07:42:48] <buu> how many bytes is that
[07:42:54] <Rockwood> sheetjs, o/
[07:43:14] <sheetjs> 200e6? 200Mb (the one the sd card manufacturers use)
[07:43:18] <buu> oh
[07:43:27] <buu> and that causes node to fail to alloc it???
[07:43:36] <buu> Is node still limited to like 1gib of total allocations or something
[07:43:49] <sheetjs> the node string limit is ~256MB
[07:43:56] <sheetjs> n> 1<<29
[07:43:57] <jellobot> (okay) 536870912
[07:44:00] <buu> oh node
[07:44:03] <sheetjs> err 512 MB
[07:44:05] <buu> never stop being so random
[07:44:07] <sheetjs> that's actually a V8 limit
[07:44:16] <buu> same thing

[07:54:38] <systemfault> The this is probably not what you expect.
[07:54:55] <systemfault> Also, $('meta[name]') should be enough
[07:56:15] <ryzenda> that is correct, this doesn't actually work

[13:12:50] <blacked> as people tell , `expressjs` makes much easy than using vanilla `nodejs` .
[13:12:51] <blacked> Same ,if i use golang instead of golang framework what would be,
[13:13:03] <blacked> in this time there are not yet matured golang framework :(

[13:14:34] <blacked> but i like golang
[13:14:37] <sickdyd> it will simplify your life and it's commonly used with Node.js
[13:15:01] <sickdyd> so you're asking a Golang question on #javascript?

[13:17:34] <sickdyd> sorry, I have no clue

[18:01:30] <tokie> is there a more idiomatic way to get an iterator object from a string than "foo"[Symbol.iterator]() ?
[18:05:27] <samsch> I think any idiomatic approach would requiring knowing what the purpose is
[18:08:35] <samsch> Using iterators directly is questionably un-idiomatic in general. You kinda have to already be in the exception rather than the norm to be using something where using iterators might be directly dealt with.
[18:10:54] <samsch> Normally you'd hide any of that stuff by using Array.from() or spread/rest in idiomatic code

[18:34:35] <tokie> ljharb: it's a "i'd rather use the builtin if it exists". i already knew of third party libraries, so i was asking if there was built-in support

[19:35:14] <ljharb> just because the variable is named query doesn't mean it's querying a database

[19:36:12] <celphi> log n > n

[19:36:44] <celphi> you're saying a binary search function cant be clean?
[19:36:48] <ljharb> celphi: and `Object.entries` is already O(n) so it is *actually impossible* to get better than that

[19:37:00] <celphi> log n is faster
[19:37:04] <celphi> than O(n)
[19:37:11] <ljharb> celphi: O(n) + O(n log n) is not faster than O(n), sorry
[19:37:21] <ljharb> celphi: the thing *making the array* is O(n) and can't ever be faster than that
[19:37:21] <celphi> what?
[19:37:31] <ljharb> so using includes is actually O(2n), which is the same as O(n)
[19:37:32] <celphi> why are you adding?
[19:37:43] <howdoi> ljharb: yup, .find is what came to my mind too, rewriting some old code
[19:37:44] <ljharb> celphi: see the Object.entries() part?
[19:37:44] <celphi> you dont have to search entire list
[19:37:49] <ljharb> celphi: Object.entries does
[19:37:54] <ljharb> celphi: it's unavoidable in that code sample
[19:38:09] <ljharb> celphi: you're speaking in general, but in *this specific case* is is actually impossible to beat O(n), this has been CS 101 tyvm bye
[19:38:16] <ljharb> howdoi: def .find
[19:38:29] <celphi> .includes is O(n)
[19:38:42] <ljharb> celphi: yes but *Object.entries which is making the array includes is being called on* is already O(n)
[19:39:02] <ljharb> celphi: so even if you can get the search faster, *you've already done O(n) so the overarching operation can never get faster than that*
[19:39:02] <celphi> im not including Object.entires in either situation
[19:39:13] <ljharb> celphi: then you're speaking in general terms but not speaking to this specific situation
[19:39:22] <ljharb> celphi: and in THIS SPECIFIC SITUATION Object.entries is part of it, and thus O(n) is the best you can do
[19:39:39] <ljharb> trying to optimize the search *in this case* is a waste of effort

[19:40:11] <celphi> that's the whole discussion
[19:40:17] <ljharb> i'm talking about algorithmic complexity, which is what big O is
[19:40:30] <ljharb> if you say "O of something" you're not talking about performance, you're talking about algorithmic complexity
[19:40:37] <celphi> O(n) means you have to iterate the entire list. that's what .includes does
[19:40:39] <ljharb> which obv relates to performance, but they're distinct.
[19:40:42] <ljharb> yes, i know that
[19:40:46] <ljharb> but that's what Object.entries did
[19:40:49] <celphi> you dont have to iterate the entire list
[19:40:57] <ljharb> and nobody cares about the general case, we're talking about this specific situation, where you already had to iterate the entire list

[23:18:57] <blueagain> KevinX: what if you're born on mars and wanna buy alcohol on earth? normal ids aren't helpful much
[23:20:07] <KevinX> When you can buy alcohol is just based on when society things the average person is developed enough to handle it
[23:20:19] <KevinX> Nothing to do with the number 21 or 18
[23:20:56] <blueagain> sure, but effectively you still need systems to verify that a person can buy alcohol
[23:20:56] <KevinX> We would come up with new systems as they are needed and discovered
[23:21:27] <KevinX> Maybe humans develop differently on Mars, so there would have to be a system to account for that
[23:21:54] <blueagain> also, things like birthday on make sense on the planet you've been born on

[23:22:08] <KevinX> birthdays hardly make sense anywhere
[23:22:44] <blueagain> many people celebrate their birthday, even after childhood
