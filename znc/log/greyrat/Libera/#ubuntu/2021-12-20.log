[00:47:01] <tomreyn> artaud: unless it's provided by a third party or this version happens to be available as a snap, your options will be limited to building it yourself.
[00:47:14] <tomreyn> what's the missing feature you're looking for?
[00:47:42] <artaud> I need to connect to a vpn server who accepts only this version
[00:47:55] <artaud> I tried to find some reps, no success
[00:48:52] <artaud> when i tried to build, i had this: configure: error: no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH
[00:49:52] <tomreyn> how does the remote server indicate that it will only accept this very client version then?

[01:10:49] <wiileewaller> ok so do you mean that when you install  linux ubuntu, there is already tools that alsa need in the kernel?

[01:32:30] <tomreyn> wiileewaller: i don't see it saying that you should rebuild alsa or the kernel (at leats not in the first few posts). and even if it does somewhere then this is sooo old that i wouldn't rely on that still being the case. instead, it discusses approaches you can try without building software, and i'm suggesting tou to try those first. i.e. in the first answer
[01:32:37] <orange1> sudo apt install pavucontrol
[01:32:49] <wiileewaller> there is not other option
[01:32:50] <orange1> go to last tab and select 5.1 might be in there

[04:44:14] <jhutchins> [itchyjunk]: The name associated with file/directory ownership is in a single location (/etc/passwd), the name of the folder is in the filesystem.  There's a utility to do the whole thing in one or two steps.
[04:47:33] <jhutchins> [itchyjunk]: It's probably best to use the utility rather than hacking at it and potentially leaving loose ends.

[13:33:08] <shadowbird2468> its a nvidia sound device. other ppl have had similar problems with it aswell, but havent found any fix to the problem. at this pont I'd be happy just to make some get around the issue fix
[13:33:49] <KBar> shadowbird2468: pavucontrol-qt is a Qt port of pavucontrol. Official Ubuntu flavors that run in Qt are Kubuntu and Lubuntu.
[13:34:30] <KBar> If it's not running in those environments, I'd suggest replacing it with `pavucontrol`.
[13:34:42] <shadowbird2468> yea, I'd use pulsemixer, but it doesnt keep nvidias audio profile from dropping
[13:34:45] <KBar> It being your father's computer.
[13:35:14] <shadowbird2468> I'll try pavucontrol instead, maybe it'll work

[18:21:39] <polve> Hi.  What is the suggested way to install telegram-desktop?  Looks like the version currently in the repo is outdated
[18:22:14] <jkc> polve: snap
[18:22:22] <jkc> https://snapcraft.io/telegram-desktop
[18:23:00] <polve> Ok, I might have to learn what snap is, I have postponed it for a bit
[18:23:09] <polve> Thank you jkc
[18:23:24] <jkc> https://snapcraft.io/install/telegram-desktop/ubuntu
[18:23:28] <jkc> There's the how-to. :)
[18:23:39] <leftyfb> polve: sudo snap install telegram-desktop
[18:23:56] <jkc> polve: They're basically applications bundled with the libraries that they require. Doesn't depend on system-wide packages.
[18:24:16] <octav1a> oh snap
[18:24:38] <jkc> polve: And what leftyfb said is correct for all currently-supported Ubuntu releases.

[20:45:33] <TomyLobo> hi, I'm trying to get my old wsl setup working again. I used ubuntu, KDE Konsole, cygwin's X server and it all just worked. now I updated it to wsl2 and a new ubuntu version (20.04) and it no longer works cause it's missing a platform plugin for X11. is there any way to install that?

[20:46:29] <ubottu> TomyLobo: Windows 10 and newer have a feature called "Windows Subsystem for Linux", which allows it to run Ubuntu (and other Linux distro) userspace programs without porting/recompliation. For installation instructions, see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide
[20:46:42] <TomyLobo> that's not helping

[20:47:53] <oerheks> use the wsl docs ? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment

[22:12:36] <TomyLobo> I mean... I wouldn't compile nginx from source either, but come on, apache? nginx can also do vhosts and the only reason "sophisticated hosting" would require an apache is if it's php or something. And even that can be hosted with an nginx using fastcgi now
[22:13:53] <TomyLobo> ash_worksi, if you use case requires compiling nginx from source, it is either very specialized (i.e. go to #nginx instead of asking here) or you're doing it wrong (i.e. go do it right)

[22:17:34] <jhutchins> The reason for using Apache instead of nginx is that there's a very large body of experience and documentation for many possible scenarios.  You don't have to be a "first adopter".  Not that nginx is new, except in comparison with Apache.
[22:18:26] <jhutchins> ash_worksi: TomyLobo's suggestion of #nginx is a good idea.

[22:21:00] <llanhmod> hey guys, need tips for resolving this dependency issue: https://bpa.st/VX3A,  currently I want to start the mongdb server but I get `mongod.service not found`.  I do have mongod installed.
[22:21:43] <llanhmod> background: I did install mongodb-shell from .deb sources, and I think this may be causing me issues.
[22:22:15] <TomyLobo> that's not a dependency issue, that's a prompt. what happens if you say yes?

[22:25:04] <llanhmod> hm...let me try that.
[22:25:08] <TomyLobo> that should show you 2 of the packages you need to get rid of
