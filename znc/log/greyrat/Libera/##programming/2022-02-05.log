[02:25:33] <apotheon> I wouldn't try to pit them against each other.  If they're serious about wanting to keep you, they may up the offer without having to tell them they're competing against someone else.
[02:25:44] <PlanckWalk> Yeah
[02:25:57] <apotheon> You don't want your employer to resent you from day one.
[02:26:06] <apotheon> I assume you don't, anyway.
[02:26:15] <pyzozord> and I'd have no scrupulous pitting them against each other

[02:26:45] <apotheon> While scruples are important, I'm talking about your employer resenting you, not about scruples.

[02:27:57] <pyzozord> If they want you they'll pay. They will not pay if they can't afford you.
[02:28:03] <pyzozord> It's a business.
[02:28:20] <pyzozord> That's my coldhearted attitude to companies
[02:28:23] <pyzozord> especially big ones
[02:28:54] <pyzozord> companies aren't people, can't treat them like a single person. They are much more powerful entities
[02:28:54] <PlanckWalk> Yep.  It does inconvenience them to back out of a verbally accepted offer, but not very much and certainly not the loss that you would be taking by declining the way better one.
[02:29:29] <pyzozord> I personally believe that this relationship is by definition biased and unfair
[02:29:38] <pyzozord> between an company and an employee
[02:29:51] <PlanckWalk> If anything, it's better that you take it now rather than give notice in your first week to take it, which you're well within your rights to do.
[02:30:24] <pyzozord> so no scrupulous, unless you know, small, family owned, good honest people owned place. Then I can be nicer to them
[02:30:56] <pyzozord> I quit a job after 2 weeks of working
[02:31:06] <pyzozord> because previous job came back with a better offer
[02:32:21] <PlanckWalk> And yeah, it is biased and unfair to employees.
[02:32:51] <PlanckWalk> It's nearly always an exclusive arrangement for the employee, and not for the employer.
[02:33:23] <pyzozord> some of my friends thought it was a unscrupulous move, and the owners of the company I quit felt a bit offended at the idea of raising my salary to counteroffer,  but again I don't feel anything for companies

[03:18:23] <pyzozord> gnight :P
[03:18:24] <ski> but we don't go around annotating every subexpression with a type, because most languages can trivially infer the type of an expression, given the type of its direct subexpressions. which only leaves the premises/axioms, being the types of the variables, to be explicitly spelled out
[03:18:51] <ProfSimm> ski: sure we can still infer a lot of it.
[03:18:56] <ski> but, with something like Hindley-Milner type-inference, even the types of the variables can very commonly be inferred, by how the variables are used
[03:19:10] <ProfSimm> ski: but I'm takling about the cases you can't infer.
[03:19:59] <ProfSimm> ski: let's say we have a dynamically typed return result on bar()    so:   var x = bar(): int;
[03:20:02] <ski> ProfSimm : well, you'd still need to associate the variable with the typed value (at least as long as that variable holds that value (only relevant for mutable variables))

[03:26:44] <ProfSimm> ski: we can keep the abstract interpretation, but remove the boundary between types and values

[03:29:53] <ProfSimm> I.e. you never set a type on a variable. Just on values

[03:31:23] <ProfSimm> OK I'll try to express it another way. A language which is internally typed. But in the source, nothing is ever typed, you just have type assertions on values. And the compiler infers everything else
[03:31:41] <lf94> Literally sounds like JS
[03:31:47] <lf94> (or any dynamically typed lang)
[03:31:50] <ProfSimm> The compiler infers nothing in JS
[03:31:58] <PlanckWalk> Oh, so variables *do* have strong types but they're inferred?
[03:32:00] <ski> (even dynamically typed languages has types in the static sense. namely a single, universal, type. hence sometimes they're called "unityped". but it really helps here to realize that what static languages call a "type" is not the same thing as what is typically called a "type" in dynamically typed languages)

[03:47:58] <ski> "aren't contracts just assertions by another name" -- at least higher-order contracts do keep track of who (which part of the code) to blame, when some particular subcontract is violated. so that's not just simple assertions

[05:00:00] <Decker> no unique is local
[05:00:05] <Decker> it is an index though
[05:00:06] <ProfSimm> An index doesn't make them foreign keys

[05:00:42] <Decker> you can use that pair as primary key - but it's generally not a great idea

[05:37:37] <ProfSimm> Decker: that said the version you'll write and read as a human should be optimized for humans. If you have to both indent and track little things like trailing commas and semicolons, I think that's a bad system

[05:48:20] <ProfSimm> MsFoxyEmilySmith: what is te problem 
[05:48:44] <Decker> well I'm not really talking about lines; that's true.  I'm talking about statements.
[05:49:02] <Decker> A line with multiple statments isn't a continued statement ...
[05:49:10] <Decker> (I guess?)
[05:49:34] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> in mathematics, a line is a set of coordinates in 3D or higher dimensions, there's no assumptions about linearity or otherwise, etc. in programming a line is like 1,2,3,4. ... max 1000 for most programs. we have no standardized 'coordinate' system for saying x, y and z are hot spots in the program
[05:49:54] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> this is the fundamental reason why programming is seen as linear or 1 dimensional
[05:50:19] <Decker> and it's only been recently that I've toyed with multiple statments on a line...  x=q.nx; y=q.ny; z=q.nz; 
[05:50:22] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> very good programmers like myself have to invent their own coordinate systems that have their own semantic meaning
[05:50:23] <ProfSimm> MsFoxyEmilySmith: in programming a line is a line of text, not a line of points.

[05:57:18] <Decker> each block has its own relative line numbers I guess - like scratch prodecure blocks have
[05:57:24] <Decker> (even if it's not shown )
[05:58:32] <ProfSimm> MsFoxyEmilySmith: the problem of code lines and so on is that without code lines, we have no context. Say how would you encode a stack trace
[05:58:59] <Decker> SO i have this cannon physics that works pretty well, and tensorflow JS, and I can make a body with a bunch of motors and orientation sensors as input to a network, and make it learn how to stand up?

[06:16:24] <ProfSimm> Another thing I'm trying to figure out is inverse scope inheritance. So instead of nested scopes inheriting vars from parent scopes, I want to have parent scope inherit child variables, so the parent scope expression becomes a sort of "high level" expression of what the entire code does

[06:17:11] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> ProfSimm isnt that just event driven programming?
[06:17:15] <ProfSimm> Haskell has something similar with the "where" clause
[06:17:22] <ProfSimm> MsFoxyEmilySmith: nah
[06:17:40] <ProfSimm> It's just a way of structuring code so that the high-level expressions are highly meaningful
[06:17:46] <ProfSimm> I hope
[06:19:03] <ProfSimm> Normally we do this by defining functions and classes and referring to them in high level code
[06:19:07] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> i thought that was the entire prob with UIs
[06:19:23] <ProfSimm> I want to enable nested code you use in this way but is special-purpose
[06:19:28] <ProfSimm> For that expression only
[06:19:36] <ProfSimm> And you nest it under
[06:19:44] <ProfSimm> Like one-time functions/vars use
[06:20:04] <duuude> are there offline translators? are they feasible?
[06:20:11] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> ProfSimm if its that simple why not just invert in your source code? like make parent child and vice versa
[06:20:23] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> seems trivial
[06:20:31] <ProfSimm> MsFoxyEmilySmith: because I still need it the other way around
[06:22:58] <ProfSimm> MsFoxyEmilySmith: I may make it an operator, like    expr expr expr << code
[06:23:36] <ProfSimm> MsFoxyEmilySmith: the output of code is merged into the symbol table of expr expr expr so it can use them as any other local variables

[06:24:52] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> ok then whats a specific use case?
[06:25:01] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> that isnt addressed by normal scope
[06:25:09] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> besides UI
[06:25:16] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> or event driven programming
[06:26:02] <ProfSimm> The specific use case is needing to define lots of expressions and little one-off functions in order to write a statement, and you litter your local scope with them, and you only need them for that statement.
[06:26:48] <ProfSimm> Also I want the ability to hide those, fold them, so you see the high-level skeleton of the code, not these details by default
[06:27:16] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> hm
[06:27:33] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> honestly I think 'scope' should be a much more dynamic thing
[06:27:47] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> like what we were discussing earlier if we tied scope to something else
[06:28:04] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> than just line or parent vs child
[06:28:15] <ProfSimm> It can still be dynamic, but you can't escape there being parent and child
[06:28:18] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> true scope should be contextual
[06:28:18] <ProfSimm> It's a tree
[06:28:47] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> contextual is mostly local

[07:37:57] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> since theres 7 days of week it would likely be a MODULO behind scenes to identify 5th day aka FRIDAY once you can ENCODE the DAY as integer
[07:38:44] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> or if zero index like most computers would be modulo 4
[07:39:27] <MsFoxyEmilySmith> I'd do step 1: function to extract day step 2. modulo by 4 (zero indexing) and then quick sort and subset top 6

[11:37:50] <Decker> I have this user database I'm tinkering with
[11:38:11] <Decker> right now, I support a guest login that's like IRC and doesn't require anything other than a name...
[11:38:50] <Decker> I was wondering for a while how to store them, if they should be different than users? If so later making them into a user (getting verified in twitter parlance?) would be more difficult.
[11:38:53] *** Quits: node1 (~hex@user/node1) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[11:39:19] <Decker> I decide maybe using ZWNBSP (\ufeff) as a leadin for guests will make the database indexing on username never fail
[11:40:16] <Decker> but then I have to at least disallow that as the first character of real accounts; and probably should just generally reject anything that contains one anywhere; but then what other sanity rules would I need?  It's full UTF8; so depending on the client, unicodes can be stacked on each other and look like other things anyway...

[11:43:00] <absentia> otherwise, do a lookup in a separate guest table
[11:43:17] <absentia> well actually, if authentication is not provided, you still need to lookup the user in the main table
[11:43:24] <absentia> otherwise anyone could log into any account without providing auth
[11:43:49] <Decker> right; there's some loose form of identity - that's as anonymous as bitcoin (but more like IRC)
[11:44:44] <absentia> i think the key point is that guests aren't users
[11:44:50] <absentia> so don't try to model them as the same thing
[11:45:06] <absentia> prefixing with \ufeff is a weird hack to try to model them in the same table
[11:45:08] <Decker> but all a user is is an id and a name

[11:49:43] <absentia> i'm saying if you don't prefix guests with \ufeff you don't have to write these validations in your app
[11:50:24] <absentia> it is weird to distinguish between one type of user and another type of user, both stored in the same table, by the presence of a unicode character prefix
[11:50:29] <Decker> well I do I don't want D{\ufeff}ecker and D{\ufeff}ecke{\ufeff}r and Deck{\ufeff}er

[15:06:41] <amigojapan> GeDaMo: why didn't they make it just '/0'?
[15:06:47] <pyzozord> 2's compliment makes -1 flip all bits on, but there is less bits in char

[15:11:20] <amigojapan> I see sandman13 
[15:11:28] <user51> sandman13: awk 'BEGIN{RS=FS=""}0' makes it faster
[15:11:55] <GeDaMo> Yeah, UTF-8 removes endianness as a problem
[15:11:56] <pikapika> utf8 uses a prefix scheme
[15:12:03] <Decker> it's 0xFEFF as a codepoint though ( NBZWSP non-breaking zero-width space)
[15:12:04] <pikapika> its similar to the old ip classes trick

[15:23:02] <vdamewood> pikapika: I got a dictionary with latin writing for the words.
[15:23:18] <pikapika> vdamewood, I mean when you read a farsi text
[15:23:28] <pikapika> how do you know what vowels to insert
[15:23:42] <vdamewood> I memorize it on a word-by-word basis.
[15:23:45] <Mortician> insert?
[15:24:00] <sandman13> Did Farsi as a language change after Islamic invasion of Persia?
[15:24:01] <Mortician> lol
[15:24:06] <pikapika> vdamewood, thats a lot to memorize

[15:24:46] <pikapika> amigojapan, it makes it very difficult to learn
[15:24:48] <vdamewood> amigojapan: Hebrew, at least, follows patterns in where vowels go.
[15:24:57] <amigojapan> pikapika: yep
[15:25:08] <Mortician> what lol
[15:25:08] <amigojapan> I see vdamewood

[15:27:54] <pikapika> Persian is one of the hardest, if your app can do persian I think other languages would be a cakewalk
[15:27:56] <vdamewood> pikapika: Also It helps to think of Arabic letters as 'big' and 'small'.The 'big' form comes at the end or is isloated. the small letter comes at the beginning or in the middle.
[15:28:11] <pikapika> amigojapan, Quran is explicit about punctuation marks and vowels
[15:28:17] <vdamewood> pikapika: The big form is usually just the small form with an extra flourish.
[15:28:26] <Mortician> jesus
[15:28:33] <amigojapan> I see pikapika 
[15:28:34] <pikapika> vdamewood, yeah the 'i' and 'h' letters are confusing
[15:28:37] <pikapika> in their big and small forms
[15:28:41] <sandman13> Language reminds me, lack of resources related to translation of Sanskrit is painful.
[15:28:46] <vdamewood> pikapika: So, Jim, for example, has that side-ways V shape as its small form. But the hook is the extra flourish on the big form.
[15:29:08] <amigojapan> vdamewood: which language has space first?
[15:29:08] <pikapika> The independent jeem is very striking and easy to recognize

[15:31:12] <pikapika> If we think about it a bit it becomes clear why the half jeem has the hook leftward rather than a shortening of the full form which would make it rightward: the leftward can connect with the next letter, but rightward can't

[15:34:36] <sandman13> pikapika: It uses Gurumukhi no?
[15:35:07] <pikapika> I think gurmukhi is used in indian
[15:35:13] <pikapika> I was thinking of Pakistan
[15:35:17] <pikapika> So yeah both I'd say then

[15:37:56] <sandman13> Yup. Most of the Islamic nations of that area use Persian script.
[15:38:12] <pikapika> sandman13, actually afghani language itself is I think considered a persian dialect
[15:38:27] <sandman13> pikapika: Kind of makes sense. It's next to Iran xD
[15:38:29] <vdamewood> pikapika: For the most part, linguists consider Dari a dialect of Persian. Pashto though is a separate language.
[15:38:32] <Rounin> vdamewood: Whereas when a character has an obvious sound component that rhymes in 9 different dialects and 3 different languages, that's probably still a compound

[15:40:58] <pikapika> vdamewood, that could be the case
[15:41:14] <Mortician> its important to have less letters
[15:41:25] <vdamewood> One of the big things about Indic scripts is that vowels are written as modifiers of the consonent of the sylable they're in, and the modifier could go anywhere relative to the base consonant, top, bottom, right, LEFT.
[15:41:29] <pikapika> Chinese and Korean are so large
[15:41:39] <vdamewood> pikapika: Korean has about 20 letters.
[15:41:40] <sandman13> vdamewood: can affirm
[15:41:43] <Rounin> We~ll, Korean can be broken down to around 24 letters, though, so that's OK
[15:41:44] <Mortician> less letters wins
[15:41:45] <pikapika> that they usually supply separate fonts
[15:41:47] <pikapika> vdamewood, oh?
[15:41:50] <pikapika> it must be japanese then
[15:41:56] <pikapika> but I do know

[15:42:04] <pikapika> when I install fonts they provide cjk as separate options
[15:42:07] <sandman13> you can combine two consontans as well
[15:42:11] <Rounin> Yeah, Japanese... Plus you can use the Chinese characters with Korean, too, but even Koreans won't be able to read it
[15:42:12] <pikapika> and if I select cjk its quite a huge download in itself
[15:42:15] <sandman13> *consonants
[15:42:17] <vdamewood> Though, Japanese still uses Chinese characters.
[15:42:26] <Mortician> words have to be meaningful not descriprive
[15:42:41] <vdamewood> pikapika: Here's the thing about Korean. those 20 or so letters are combined into sylable blocks.
[15:42:43] <pikapika> vdamewood, yeah joining anywhere as opposed to just left and right makes it harder I'd say
[15:42:55] <leduyquang753> You can technically write Japanese in 100% hiragana but that would be hell to read.
[15:43:02] <pikapika> vdamewood, so like are these letters just "layered" to form compounds?
[15:43:25] <Mortician> hmm
[15:43:34] <Rounin> leduyquang753: And for some reason they almost never use spaces... All kana and no spaces would be even harder

[16:43:21] <epony> no
[16:43:33] <epony> hardware is much more reliable and better than previous decades

[16:44:16] <pikapika> Enemy is a strong word

[16:45:36] <pikapika> But they are deliberately putting it inside shitty and hard to repair surroundings
[16:45:38] <quetzl> we have to learn at some point that less is more

[20:02:13] <ProfSimm> I think we can define algorithm "goal" (that for which its trained on) is the external characteristic of its outputs, while "intent" is the internal goal, which can't be directly judged from output, and for which output is merely a derivative of. If someone has better definitions, I'm fine. We have poor control over ANN's intent, because we barely understand why they work in specific instances (we understand the general principles instead)
[20:03:58] <ProfSimm> Understsanding ANN requires restructuring it in layers each of which is an output we control and analyze, but this actually changes the network itself and how it acts.
[20:04:01] <nomagno> I think certain general types of goals should definitely be (loosely and not very strictly) legislated against. It might actually be a fairly important step in reducing the advance of democratic backsliding

[20:09:46] <ProfSimm> Let's see. Facebook's filters didn't manage to stop hate speech in Myanmar, so our solution is to make it impossible for them to have filters. Would this stop hate speech, let's think?

[20:10:20] <[itchyjunk]> i'll file it under the absurd folder and move on
[20:10:48] <ProfSimm> nomagno: twitter didn't have filters until they saw people subscribe to literally thousands of people, and then be frustrated their timeline is noise
[20:10:52] <ProfSimm> This is why we have filters
[20:11:06] <InPhase> The core problem isn't really the presence of filtering, but that the companies are not held responsible for the consequences of the designs of the algorithms.

[20:18:52] <[itchyjunk]> X-Scale, yeah
[20:18:57] <InPhase> ProfSimm: The core problem is that they have internal study results which show that profit would go down slightly if they stopped promoting negative divisiveness, so they choose not to because that would be worse for shareholders to have a slight reduction in profits.

[20:31:02] <[itchyjunk]> outlawing people is lesser of dumb ideas being suggested.
[20:31:45] <oldlaptop> InPhase: Turning that around, do social media algorithms meaningfully deprive people of moral agency?

[20:34:20] <InPhase> oldlaptop: This is in fact the key thing we need to adjust in our perspective.  We have been up until now holding people as the primary actors, but now we have the ability to design algorithms that can outwit and manipulate huge chunks of the public.

[23:53:20] <l2ftsnek_> I've realized that when I'm asking questions about code that I'm trying to write I'm getting good answers but i'm not adept enough yet to ask the right question so I don't get the answer I ultimately need. Is this something that just comes with time or is there some way I can strengthen my ability to get to the ultimate why
[23:55:05] <deniska> l2ftsnek_: s/time/experience/ :)
[23:55:06] <pulse> asking the right questions is hard, and in many cases asking the right questions makes you see the answer

[23:55:39] <Irishmanluke> been looking at rust macros https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html
[23:55:40] <bayaz> Title: Macros - The Rust Programming Language 
[23:55:41] <pyzozord> l2ftsnek_: trick them to answer by correcting you :P

[23:56:00] <ski> reflect, stare out the window sometimes, try to understand different viewpoints, different concerns
[23:56:02] <deniska> ah, yes, pondering the wrong answer trick

[23:56:12] <Irishmanluke> eh maybe I should go to #rust
[23:56:26] <l2ftsnek_> ok so i guess for the time being i just deal with the frustration. I've ripped apart this code like 200 times because I get to a certain point and realize I can't continue or maybe I just haven't figured out how too.
[23:56:31] <Irishmanluke> I was going to talk about metaprogramming in general though as well
[23:56:37] <flakland> TIL rust has macros
[23:56:55] <pyzozord> l2ftsnek_: maybe we can help here
[23:57:00] <Irishmanluke> rust macros seem really cool compared to c macros
[23:57:14] <deniska> flakland: your typical rust hello world involves calling a macro, println! :)
[23:57:20] <Irishmanluke> although there are three different types of rust macros
[23:57:42] <flakland> i'm resisting the urge to say something "controversial" about macros
[23:58:08] <Irishmanluke> but the cool thing I guess in general is just the idea that basically they're flexible to basically allow you to define your own syntax within rust
[23:58:24] <Irishmanluke> not that that's necessarily smart idk, but its definitely cool
[23:58:27] <tomathy> Irishmanluke: if im over 30% irish can i call myself irish?
[23:58:38] <Irishmanluke> tomathy: you can do whatever you want
[23:58:49] <tomathy> but is it legitimate
[23:58:50] <Irishmanluke> I'm only like 60% Irish
[23:58:52] <l2ftsnek_> pyzozord: I don't have the code in front of me it's at work but the gist of it is every day a json file is generated which I need to filter results from the problem is that I need information from 3 dictionaries inside 1 key and i only need them if a certain condition exists so even having written a x for x if statement to search for that condition only seems to allow me to pull one piece of
[23:58:53] <l2ftsnek_> information
[23:59:05] <Irishmanluke> I'm probably not legit myself
