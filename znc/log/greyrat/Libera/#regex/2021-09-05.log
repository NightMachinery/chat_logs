[05:26:54] <Me-me> Alright, let's take a look.
[05:27:28] <Me-me> Are you sure this is the right link? None of those strings have Realtime in them, and the regex is different.
[05:27:44] <re101-okapi-46> https://regex101.com/r/yghwW2/1
[05:28:00] <re101-okapi-46> I Am very new to this sorry.
[05:29:32] <Me-me> That's okay, you're actually doing great compared to others. You know what you want and you're posting regex101 links.
[05:29:42] <Me-me> https://regex101.com/r/yghwW2/2
[05:29:52] <Me-me> Turns out it was 24 characters before "Realtime" and there was no space, so those were messing it up.
[05:32:35] <re101-okapi-46> Excellent, I only know how to searche & replace in NotePad++ but can now clean log files there to make them more readble.

[15:28:15] <sam43> yea but don't know how to use it 
[15:28:19] <Me-me> You put the pattern in the pattern box and the test string in the test string box.
