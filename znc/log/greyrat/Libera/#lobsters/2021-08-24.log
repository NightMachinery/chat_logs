[00:06:01] <manicennui> The one entry they have for our entry level position pretty much confirms what I thought.
[00:06:08] <manicennui> $94k for a fresh grad.
[00:06:43] <manicennui> And $109k for the level above that, which can be obtained in 18-24 months.

[11:43:01] <_ak_> gerikson: people who don't have an interest in the internet being the joy that it once was -- their new interest is mine users personal data (in hopes of influencing them later), and having an ever growing bloated web experience that plays right into `planned obsolescence'

[13:10:47] <wink> those projects usually have an ML archive on the... web
[13:11:13] <wink> and only to participate you need to, surprise, use email. something also most people could do without large effort

[18:02:46] <epilys> Now you made me think: an OS without a shell, at all
[18:02:51] <epilys> is this hard mode?
[18:02:57] <southclaws> sounds logical tbh
[18:03:11] <southclaws> or at least a command interface that isn't also a small programming language
[18:03:27] <epilys> 95% of the time I'm in the terminal though, I can't really imagine otherwise
[18:03:35] <southclaws> I find posix shell is neat for commands and chaining tools together, but it absolutely sucks for larger things
[18:03:42] <southclaws> but powershell is the opposite
[18:03:59] <river> I think that shell language should use {/} instead of if/fi, case/esac etc.
[18:04:12] <southclaws> much nicer in large scripts, as it's type safe, has natural feeling syntax like loops/switches/etc but it's a little slower to do stuff that posix shell can do on the cmdline
[18:04:19] <southclaws> >I think that shell language should use {/} instead of if/fi, case/esac etc.
[18:04:21] <southclaws> yes!!!
[18:04:39] <southclaws> I hate reading bash scripts that are any longer than 1 line
[18:04:46] <southclaws> if/fi, case/esac, what a mess

[18:05:20] <gwozniak> The GUI would count as the shell, in that case, I suppose
[18:05:27] <river> if you wanted to automate tasks you could script it with applescript, which was often able to control programs directly - click buttons in GUIs etc.

[18:08:37] <southclaws> not everyone wants to express ideas in text
[18:08:58] <epilys> indeed, it was a hyperbole; i'm just used to text programming
[18:08:59] <Brekkjern> NiFi is amazing and that is just a bunch of boxes with lines between them.
[18:09:05] <epilys> I bet non-computing people would find this usable
[18:09:08] <southclaws> flow charts are often used to plan systems anyway, if all you're planning is business logic and all the plumbing is abstracted away already, why not use a nice flow chart?
[18:09:23] <river> flow charts coding seems like such a great idea, i wonder why ive never seen it done
[18:09:24] <southclaws> I'm a software engineer and even I like flow chart builders
[18:09:35] <southclaws> it's done in the games industry, there are quite a few tools that use those interfaces
[18:09:36] <epilys> southclaws, you sound like you like charts and thinking, check this out https://medium.com/message/amazing-military-infographics-1ba60bdc32e7

[18:09:40] <gwozniak> Graphical representations do get a bit crazy after a while
[18:09:44] <southclaws> one of them being unreal engine
[18:10:10] <epilys> gwozniak, yeah try implementing a device driver in that
[18:10:12] <southclaws> haha I've seen these epilys, pretty funny looking tbh
[18:10:34] <epilys> I love them, you can feel the excitement of military people discovering thought
[18:10:51] <southclaws> but yes, unreal engine's tooling for designers (both technical and non-technical) are a success story for visual programming for sure
[18:11:06] <southclaws> but the games industry isn't very open, so this stuff is often locked away behind NDAs and in-house tooling/workflows
[18:11:08] <epilys> i'll check it out, didn't know it had visual programming stuff
[18:11:12] <river> oh thats by paul ford!
[18:11:16] <epilys> is it like the block programming on Blender3d?
[18:11:21] <southclaws> yeah
[18:11:30] <southclaws> ah yes of course, shader programming too, those are often done with visual stuff
[18:11:52] <southclaws> I used to love playing with shaders in Maya, Unreal and the other one I forgot the name of
[18:12:01] <epilys> cool! I had forgotten about that. It's some proof visual programming works with non-programmers
[18:12:04] <southclaws> much more intuitive for trying things out and experimenting, doing it in code would be a pain
[18:13:04] <southclaws> i've often thought about a possible mix of both, functions existing anywhere in a "canvas" (think, virtual whitespace) and small thin lines connecting their call sites and stuff
[18:13:10] <southclaws> instead of the traditional top-to-bottom
[18:13:30] <southclaws> might build a proof of concept one day
[18:15:15] <epilys> it'd probably need a way to do view filtering. Might end up as a mess of wires with a lot of content
[18:15:17] <mockturtle> Daily Rust: Iterators [rust] (napkindrawing) https://lobste.rs/s/rhmfod
[18:16:10] <southclaws> oh yeah totally,  but that's a similar problem to just having large source files and poor separation of concerns
[18:16:34] <southclaws> same problem just a different medium, we have the same issue in Figma files for UX/UI design flows
[18:17:13] <southclaws> but one thing you can do in Unreal engine's editor is create groups which can be expanded/contracted (contracted? made smaller) so they basically turn into a "black box" with some inputs and outputs
[18:18:48] <epilys> oberon had an interesting interface: infinitely zoomable, you click anywhere and type the name of the app to run

[19:13:31] <aram> there, I did it.
[19:13:40] <aram> who said you can't have sum types in go.
[19:13:43] <aram> enjoy.
[19:14:52] <companion_cube> is this based on type enumrations in the generics system?
[19:14:58] <aram> nope.
[19:15:24] <river> GADTs in go?
[19:16:25] <aram> it is based on the fact that go interfaces are existential types.
[19:16:25] <aram> it uses generics for encoding contraints, but the mechanism itself doesn't use generics.
[19:16:29] <aram> it's just existential quantification, which is equivalent to rank-2 universal quantification.
[19:16:46] <river> wild
[19:16:59] <aram> you don't need generics at all if you only want ADTs (and not GADts).
[19:17:50] <aram> that being said, I found about ~20 bugs in Go generics while doing this.
[19:17:50] <aram> most of them are fixed.
