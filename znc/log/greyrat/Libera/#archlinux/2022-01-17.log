[00:28:36] <salkin> Namarrgon: I have enough space free on sda3 aka `/home` to hold the entire sda2 aka `/`
[00:28:54] <Namarrgon> you're not answering my question
[00:29:15] <salkin> 290 gigs is stored on `/home`
[00:29:38] <Namarrgon> you can copy / to /home but then you're stuck with a 50gb partition
[00:29:53] <Foxboron> right, can't extend upwards...
[00:30:07] <Namarrgon> to move the start of the /home partition you would need to move the entire content
[00:30:40] <Namarrgon> if you go that route then make a backup of the important data first
[00:30:54] <urawotlol> this would be alot easier if you had an external hard drive. is that an option?
[00:31:05] *** Joins: lsrtl__ (~lsrtl@user/lsrtl)
[00:31:33] <salkin> okay. so backup `/home` to another disk, nuke sda3, remove it. resize sda2 to use the entire space. move `/home` back into the disk.
[00:31:50] <salkin> yes external disk is a posibility fo sho
[00:31:53] <urawotlol> consider LVM or btrfs 
[00:32:04] <urawotlol> to save you this effort in the future
[00:32:08] <salkin> compared to ext4?
[00:32:28] <th0rne> You can have ext4s on an lvm.
[00:32:40] <urawotlol> you can do LVM+EXT4 or btrfs which does filesystem and volume managment
[00:33:10] <salkin> okay this i need to check out!
[00:33:27] <urawotlol> defenately. will save you the headache in the future
[00:33:37] <salkin> thanks everyone
[00:34:02] <urawotlol> but for now, i think you are best copying your entire drive to another one, repartitioning this one properly (LVM or BTRFS) then copying everything back

I'm doing an rsync backup with `sudo rsync -avh --delete /path/to/origin /mnt/backups`, and I get a lot of these errors: `rsync: [receiver] chown "/mnt/backups/Documents/._MSC6677.JPG.s82AHy" failed: Operation not permitted (1)`. The `/mnt/backups` is an NFS folder I mounted with `sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.1.123:/nfs_backups /mnt/backups`, with the squash setting set as `Map all users to guest` with rw permissions. Any ideas what might be

[07:44:41] <norbert> question concerning plocate: It seems not to do anything, even after triggering updatedb manually. plocate whatever does not find anything, and the database is only a few hundred bytes. Am I missing something?
[07:45:34] <MortimerHoughton> thrice: Well, I guess that's the next step, look up a general description of the problem with some of the specifics of my hardware.  Thanks for trying to help.

[14:36:35] <grawity> the sig is fine, your pacman keyring less so

[14:39:03] <grawity> edgy: yeah the actual file is fine, and --verify even says the signature is okay – the problem is that the *signer* isn't quite recognized

[15:07:03] <grawity> uh those are two different things

[15:07:34] <grawity> the other's a setting about what to do *if* it's activated (i.e. blank vs do something else)
[15:07:57] <grawity> if you turn off screensaver-ing in general, that isn't going to make all the specific settings disappear

[15:14:41] <arch-angel> actually, I do also have a question to ask
[15:14:53] <arch-angel> I use i3-wm, which, doesn't come with a session locker
[15:15:03] <arch-angel> I've tried slock, it was a pain
[15:15:20] <grawity> often, screen locking is the job of a
[15:15:22] <grawity> screensaver
[15:15:26] <arch-angel> what do you guys use for session lockers? other than the ones provided by the desktop environment of course
[15:15:38] <arch-angel> grawity, what screensavers do you use then?
[15:15:55] <grawity> I use gnome-shell's builtin lock feature, which started its life as gnome-screensaver

[15:16:10] <arch-angel> I've only tried and experienced xscreenlocker, and honestly it was a real headache and a pain

[18:45:22] <thurstylark> specifically pipewire-media-session
[18:45:35] <thurstylark> because that's what handles the hardware part of the equation
[18:46:10] <fl4co> If the user or the package manager have not sorted out the configuration file changes after update, then another instance of pipewire-media-session might be running in pipewire.service. Verify whether this is the case by checking the unit status of the pipewire.service user unit. If it shows pipewire and pipewire-media-session running, update your system and/or user configuration: 
[18:46:41] <fl4co> I understand that if both are running then something is wrong. But even if I'm wrong both are running :P

[21:14:34] <baltazar> hi! recently chromium started doing something weird with how it's drawing the window. I'm assuming it's drawing some shadow around it or whatever, but the actual window is bigger than what is visible
[21:15:08] <baltazar> except the invisible border becomes visible if I turn off my compositor, and it's also included if I try to take a screenshot of that window, which is pretty annoying
[21:15:14] <baltazar> do you know of a way to turn it off?

[23:42:39] <tbalthazar> Hi, First time Arch user here o/
[23:42:39] <tbalthazar> I'm trying to install Arch following this guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide in a Proxmox VM.
[23:42:40] <tbalthazar> I downloaded (and verified) archlinux-2022.01.01-x86_64.iso from here: https://archlinux.org/download/
[23:42:40] <phrik> Title: Installation guide - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[23:42:40] <tbalthazar> When the VM is booting, I get the Arch logo and menu and choose the first option to install Arch.
[23:42:41] <tbalthazar> Then it gets stuck cause it cannot mount ARCH_202201 (screenshot: https://ibin.co/6TuTqOIsX6Lc.png)
[23:42:41] <tbalthazar> I cannot type anything at the shell prompt. I also tried the same steps with Virtualbox on my laptop and had the same issue.
[23:42:42] <phrik> Title: Arch Linux - Downloads (at archlinux.org)
[23:42:42] <tbalthazar> I read forum threads where people were renaming their USB drive or partition, but since I'm trying to boot a VM from an ISO, I'm not sure what to try.
[23:42:42] <tbalthazar> Any idea?

[23:57:18] <tbalthazar> That was it, Namarrgon, I bumped the memory to 1GB and it now works. I'm surprised it requires more than 512MB. I guess it has to load a lot of stuff in memory during the install, then I'll be able to allocate less memory to the VM?

[23:59:08] <tbalthazar> Thanks for the context, it makes sense
[23:59:19] <matrixlark> If you can feed your VM an efi image to boot from, you could try the netboot image as well
