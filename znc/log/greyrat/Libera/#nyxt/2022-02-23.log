[15:16:30] <hsanjuan[m]> Hi! I am compiling from master but nyxt version reports as 2.1.1-1759-ge7d7217a, which is what git describe --tags gives. Is this worth opening a bug report?
[15:24:43] <hsanjuan[m]> Another question: what is the configuration needed to set emacs mode (bindings) for all buffers etc... my old config does not seem to have effect anymore.
[15:42:35] <aartaka> gsanjuan[m]: The tags are a bit off, and we're transitioning to 3.0, so it's not much of a problem. If you wish to have a proper version set, you can always define NYXT_VERSION environment variable to the necessary value.
[15:42:50] <aartaka> hsanjuan[m] ^
[15:43:10] <aartaka> Sorry for messing up your nickname (~_~;)
[15:44:33] <aartaka> hsanjuan[m]: You can go to Common settings and click the button for Emacs bindings, that should do the trick. It'll put the right snippet into your auto-config.lisp file.
[16:10:51] <hsanjuan[m]> <aartaka> "hsanjuan: You can go to Common..." <- where is the auto-config.lisp file? I clicked that setting but id did not seem to do anything

[17:12:17] <dirtcastle> I'm using version 2.2.4 btw
[17:12:31] <dirtcastle> is it there in the newer versions?
[17:12:35] <dirtcastle> maybe
[17:21:11] <Kabouik> Is 2.2.4 a thing? I'm using master and Nyxt reports 2.1.1-1755
[17:26:25] <aartaka> Kabouik: all the 2.2.4 changes are included on master, it's just the git tag that's missing.
[17:27:30] <aartaka> hsanjuan[m]: auto-config.lisp is in ~/.config/nyxt/, alongside with init.lisp.

[20:07:58] <jmercouris> aartaka: there was a bug on master where the auto config wasn’t getting written
[20:08:04] <jmercouris> I am pretty sure it is fixed though
[20:35:27] <hsanjuan[m]> <jmercouris> "aartaka: there was a bug on..." <- when I click on "emacs" nothing happens.. is it supposed to give any visual or message feedback?
[20:36:01] <jmercouris> hsanjuan[m]: it should echo something
[20:36:16] <jmercouris> It is supposed to say something in the message area
[20:36:41] <jmercouris> I recommend stable instead of master personally
[20:36:47] <jmercouris> I am using stable myself
[20:37:01] <jmercouris> But I will admit master has way cooler stuff on it
[20:37:31] <hsanjuan[m]> nope jmercouris , doesn't print anything. I always get the welcome window. I'll switch to stable
[20:39:43] <hsanjuan[m]> the looks have improved a lot since I last tried Nyxt
[20:39:46] <jmercouris> Ok, hector! Let me know how it goes

[20:48:05] <hsanjuan[m]> However in my original init.lisp file it does not recognize anymore package `nyxt/vcs`. I had *vcs-projects-roots* and *vcs-usernames-alist* and choose-clone-url set in this file

[21:44:33] <jmercouris> they didn't make the transition to 2.0.0
[21:44:41] <jmercouris> mostly because they needed a ton of work and rethinking
