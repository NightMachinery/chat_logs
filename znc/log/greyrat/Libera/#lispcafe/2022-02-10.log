[01:17:26] <sham1> How are you supposed to pretend that your preprocessor macros are lexically scoped? You don't
[01:17:57] <moon-child> I mean usually I do something like: { #define X(...) ...; ...; #undef X }
[01:18:20] <moon-child> so my macro has lexical scope, even though it's not enforced.  Like how lisp macros can be hygienic, but it's not enforced
[01:18:34] <moon-child> but this means if I want to compose macros they can't be lexical anymore

[21:19:39] <clothespin> hi gilberth
[21:20:17] <gilberth> Hi there, clothespin.
[21:20:39] <clothespin> I'm enjoying coffee, have more pods have a cup
[21:21:10] <gilberth> Sounds good as I am taking a break pondering how to proceed.
[21:22:02] <clothespin> I don't want to hack my program because i'm trying to leave it in a stable state for a demo next week
[21:22:56] <gilberth> Sounds reasonable. What kind of demo is that?
[21:22:59] <clothespin> just tweaks
[21:23:08] <clothespin> CAD demo, constraint sketcher
[21:24:21] <gilberth> Oh, that sounds exciting. What would you design with that CAD?
[21:24:29] <clothespin> machine parts
[21:25:13] <gilberth> What are the constraints like?
[21:25:46] <clothespin> tangent arc to arc, point-on-line, diameter, coincident point, etc
[21:26:13] <gilberth> I see.
[21:27:34] <clothespin> midpoint, parallel, perpendicular, vertical, horizontal, angle between lines
[21:33:46] <gilberth> Whom you'll demo it to?
[21:34:06] <clothespin> a contact in the kbe field
[21:34:23] <gilberth> kbe?
[21:34:52] <clothespin> knowledge based engineering, a popular form of design engineering in the 80's and 90's
[21:35:21] <gilberth> I almost guessed that but wasn't sure.
[21:35:56] <gilberth> What happens if the demo goes well?
[21:36:34] <clothespin> we'll see
[21:38:14] <clothespin> i could certainly spend another year working out the bugs and needed enhancements
[21:39:55] <clothespin> but after 4 years i figured it's time to demo something to someone who might care
[21:46:19] <gilberth> Yeah, things could take an awful amount of time. I am sitting on a pile of projects, all not perfect enough for me to release.
[21:47:48] <clothespin> I've been making spreadsheets documenting my bugs and enhancements and I'm going to plot a way through them, but I understand, polishing prototypes is hard
[21:48:17] <clothespin> you don't get the same dopamine thrill as with new development
[21:48:25] <gilberth> You want to craft a statistic?

[21:57:29] <ck_> they made it so
[21:57:55] <pl> as it was explained to me, the problem is that USA lost the ability to train actors
[21:58:11] <clothespin> everybody in the USA is an actor
[21:58:17] <selwyn> i've heard american actors say that the british ones are simply on another level
[21:58:22] <pl> so you have a *lot* of imported british ones, because they come packaged with professional skillset
[21:58:33] <selwyn> it surprises me
[21:58:52] <selwyn> because it seems to me that stage acting is simply different from film and tv
[21:58:59] <pl> selwyn: a lot of american actors didn't go through professional training, for various reasons (including it being simply not available)
[21:59:07] <selwyn> not clear that there should be transferrable skills
[21:59:18] <White_Flame> I think the popularity of reality tv in the USA really affected the acting profession
[21:59:21] <pl> selwyn: stage acting is different, but the skills necessary to master stage acting carry over to mastering tv/movie acting
[21:59:49] <ck_> *zoom in on the screen* *sharp sound sting* White_Flame obviously critizises the obvious here

[22:01:39] <shka> selwyn: France was like "assimilation complete" with beach
[22:01:40] <pl> meanwhile if you import a british actor with some shows under their belt, it's like getting a SAS veteran vs conscript

[22:02:47] <White_Flame> I would presume british acting training probably includes developing a good american accent?
[22:03:02] <White_Flame> it would only make sense for career development
[22:03:09] <selwyn> white_flame: i have no idea, but lots of people can pull off a good one by osmosis
[22:03:14] <White_Flame> true
[22:03:33] <selwyn> iirc hugh laurie claims to have had no coaching at all

[22:04:06] <White_Flame> it was funny when people realized that Huge Ackman wasn't american
[22:04:20] <selwyn> i got a role in the school play at age 12 based off of the strength of my american accent

[22:55:39] <shka> you can also put harrier on ship build to carry helicopters 
[22:55:46] <pl> the Pegasus engine that it is built around comes from a project for a twin-engined supersonic VTOL
[22:56:27] <shka> same applies to the F35 vtol variant
[22:56:42] <pl> shka: well, you can, but it's best if you use a STOBAR/STOV carrier
[22:56:57] <shka> japan navy is actually buying a bunch of f35 vtols
[22:57:23] <shka> pl: easier to replace aircraft then the ship
[22:57:35] <pl> so Harrier got exported to a bunch of countries that considered their naval holdings big enough to need a "sea control ship", usually STOVL carriers

[22:59:53] <pl> shka: USN actually did tests using jump ramp on the ground
[23:00:03] <shka> with F4?
[23:00:27] <pl> F-14
[23:00:49] <shka> F-14 sounds less awful 
[23:01:01] <pl> but early ones were hamstrung by shitty engine
[23:01:20] <pl> yes, TF30 was powerful, but it wasn't the engine the rest of the plane was designed around
[23:01:36] <shka> well, loosing power during takeoff is death 
[23:01:57] <pl> shka: the problem was performance at lower thrust
[23:02:29] <shka> apparently F-4 stall speed is lower then the super hornet
[23:02:38] <shka> i would have never guessed 
[23:02:42] <pl> and a lot of pilots died in unrecoverable flat spin due to that (supposedly the most realistic part of Top Gun movie), just so some bean counters saved a bit of money
[23:02:55] <pl> shka: Hornets stall speed is classified
[23:03:03] <pl> so take it with a big rock of salt
[23:03:27] <shka> isn't that supposed to be in, well, manual?
[23:03:36] <pl> shka: the classified one, yes
[23:04:13] <pl> there's the official stall speed, and there's experience of jets like F-16 and F-18 matching speed with Cessna 150 in intercept
[23:04:26] <shka> well, ok
[23:04:39] <shka> F-4 looks like it is supposed to have high stall speed
[23:04:42] <pl> just not very useful for landing (high AoA etc.)
[23:04:53] <pl> shka: F-4 is a flying brick :)
[23:05:19] <shka> well, looking at it, at least it has decently sized wings
[23:05:53] <shka> so maybe it wasn't that bad
[23:06:02] <shka> despite it chunkiness 
[23:06:35] <pl> FWIW, FAA flew it off Hermes and Ark Royal
[23:06:56] <pl> but I don't think anyone else would have dared
[23:07:07] <shka> pl: do you think we will see other variable sweep wing fighters in the future?
[23:07:13] <pl> doubtful
[23:07:32] <pl> they were a specific local maxima in design
[23:08:19] <shka> lame
[23:08:29] <pl> meanwhile since then max performance requirements fell down, and better aerodynamics came in
[23:10:16] <pl> mind you, even F-35 could fly much faster if you replaced its air intakes with variable geometry ones
[23:10:25] <shka> yeah
[23:10:38] <shka> i think that performance requirements may change in the future
[23:10:39] <pl> (it's also the reason why B-1B is effectively subsonic vs B-1A)
[23:11:37] <pl> the fixed-geometry S-ducts installed on B-1B mean it barely can breach sound barrier
[23:12:00] <shka> since you will eventually need two stage system: interceptor reaching the target using the low frequency radar, and then launching attack from a closer range
[23:12:14] <shka> so maybe, babe 
[23:12:36] <pl> shka: interestingly, I've read such comparison for a possible fight between EF2000 and F-35
[23:13:10] <shka> the return of interceptors
[23:13:15] <shka> would be a funny thing to see
[23:13:30] <pl> the EF2000 is much louder, but F-35 has problems bringing much weaponry on it without being detected
[23:13:53] <shka> pl: yeah, so CHARGE IT
[23:14:20] <pl> shka: yeah, you see, if you charge... the EF2000's passive IR system locks on you :D
[23:14:35] <shka> pl: i mean: charge with EF2000
[23:15:25] <shka> if F-35 is on the ground attack mission, it is kinda dead from the start
[23:16:16] <shka> if it is on the air combat mission, it will popup on the radar once it will try to attack, so SAMs can help
[23:17:09] <shka> also, send multiple planes 
[23:17:32] <shka> i think that stealth in fighter is slightly overrated 
[23:17:54] <shka> especially if it hurts performance 
[23:18:08] <shka> but that's just me
[23:18:50] <shka> I think that Chinese got this right 
[23:19:13] <shka> you just need to be stealthy enough
[23:19:14] <selwyn> shka: are you planning not to buy stealth fighters for your own airforce then :p
[23:19:34] <shka> selwyn: i would not buy F-35 if that would be up to me :P
[23:20:05] <shka> this airplane is poorly suited for the polish air force anyway
[23:20:29] <shka> it may work fine for Americans, we will see about that

[23:50:03] <selwyn> youtube going to do nfts :(
[23:53:32] <aeth> they are?
[23:54:18] <aeth> I have lost respect for so many companies and celebrities. I mean, I knew they were mercenary, but getting on board with a trend as empty as NFTs is particularly mercenary
[23:54:35] <aeth> there's literally nothing there
[23:54:47] <aeth> just a bunch of people trying to sell URLs high before everyone realizes that
[23:56:17] <shka> no, it is interesting
[23:56:31] <Alfr> aeth, what, you wouldn't even get that empty canvas? xD
[23:56:47] <shka> demonstrates the zeitgeist of the era
[23:57:04] <shka> also, have you looked at that NFT art?
[23:57:05] <aeth> Alfr: I mean it's easy to make money if you don't mind ripping people off. You can just go with the classic "send me 1 BTC and I'll send you 2 BTC back"
[23:57:13] <shka> a lot of astronauts, rockets, moons
[23:57:18] <aeth> NFTs are just enough layers obfuscated that legit companies are doing it
[23:57:25] <shka> it is like a religious favor
[23:57:52] <shka> *fervor
[23:58:18] <shka> that by sheer faith, a miracle will happen
[23:58:30] <shka> a modern techno cargo cult
[23:58:34] <aeth> at least if you buy a shitcoin, you buy a shitcoin and you can probably trade it for a 95% loss
[23:58:59] <Alfr> aeth, and it'll work until you run out of dumb people.
[23:58:59] <aeth> NFTs are non-fungible so if there's no market anymore, you're not even getting $0.01 for it. At least, once the scalper bots realize the market is gone
[23:59:16] <Alfr> Sadly though, that means it'll work for quite some time.
[23:59:39] <selwyn> shka: well there are apes as well
[23:59:53] <shka> also, it is funny how nft dudes talk about "community"
