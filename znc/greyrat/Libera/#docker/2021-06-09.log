[00:42:22] <b1ack0p> trying to figure out what it is

[00:42:49] <tang^> it's a contained application
[00:42:56] <akik> b1ack0p: it's about containing processes in a sandbox
[00:43:06] <b1ack0p> kinda vm?_
[00:43:18] <tang^> however, Windows and macOS do not have the features necessary to provide this containment
[00:43:20] <akik> not a vm but a container :)
[00:43:36] <b1ack0p> still kinda vm :p lol
[00:43:42] <tang^> no

[00:44:18] <b1ack0p> so they both swimming in same sea :p
[00:44:19] <tang^> assuming linux, it uses security cgroups to isolate your app from the rest of the linux system
[00:44:40] <tang^> sure, the docker host can be a VM

[00:47:54] <b1ack0p> by the way what is the difference between free docker account and paid account?
[00:48:13] <akik> b1ack0p: yes you can run docker on a headless server
[00:48:24] <tang^> on docker.com? rate limiting, I think
[00:48:37] <tang^> assuming you're using images from the hub
[00:50:11] <tang^> looking at oracle cloud free tier, looks like you get access to VMs
[00:50:23] <tang^> I guess you could run docker on each of those VMs
[00:50:43] <tang^> at which point your containers are apps securely isolated from each other on the host vm

[01:23:25] <tang^> b1ack0p: the image was created using the debian package manager. that's all.
[01:23:46] <tang^> that package manager might leave some hints in the shell configuration as a result
[01:24:01] <b1ack0p> so is it normal getting debian terminal while running python?

[19:32:34] <programmerq> apteryx the docker networking model is mostly about giving each container a fake interface so that it doesn't run into port conflicts. container-to-container communication is all that really happens on a docker network. If a container wants to egress, then it will NAT out to the host and then follow the routing table from there-- whether it's a wireless interface or whatever else you might have set
[19:32:37] <programmerq> up.
[19:32:59] <programmerq> for ingress, you publish a port. docker sets up a port forward from the host's interfaces (0.0.0.0 by default) to the container.
[19:33:11] <programmerq> so docker doesn't really know or care about what the host interfaces are
[19:34:52] <jjakob> yeah. and ipv6 is a whole nother nightmare.

[20:49:21] <programmerq> pajaroheridoâ–¸ that should pretty much just work. connect to the host's ip and as long as it's listening, it'll connect.
[20:49:43] <programmerq> of course, if the host is listening on 127.0.0.1 only, then you'd need to switch it to listen on a different host interface that is routable.
[20:49:51] <pajaroherido> what about this @programmerq
[20:49:52] <pajaroherido> - sed -i '/^bind/s/bind.*/bind 0.0.0.0/' /etc/redis/redis.conf
[20:50:07] <pajaroherido> that step to prob make it
[20:50:11] <pajaroherido> right?
[20:50:32] <programmerq> configuring the thing to listen on 0.0.0.0 ought to do it. I don't know from just looking whether that sed command would work with that particular redis.conf file

[20:53:02] <pajaroherido>  btw is this the now "official" redis place on IRC
[20:53:06] <pajaroherido> did they move out of freenode?

[20:53:28] <programmerq> not sure. If there is a redis channel here, they may have opted to move.

[22:03:19] <Flash> given an exited container, what is the equivalent of "docker exec" for running containers, if I want to poke around and look at files?
[22:04:02] <programmerq> you can't fire up a process in a stopped container. you can, however, make a .tar of the container filesystem: docker export containerid > output.tar
[22:04:30] <programmerq> if you want to look at individual files, you can also use 'docker cp' on a stopped container if you know the path already.
[22:05:49] <Flash> that makes sense; thanks
