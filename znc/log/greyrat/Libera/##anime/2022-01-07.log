[03:13:31] <Satin> cringe
[03:13:36] <MootPoot> LOL
[03:13:39] <MootPoot> Satin: kalm
[03:13:45] <Satin> this sounds so du-
[03:13:48] <Satin> yeah
[03:13:57] <MootPoot> they asked me to just find a way to count them and log them out 
[03:14:08] <Satin> so counting objects
[03:14:11] <Satin> entries
[03:14:13] <Satin> whatever
[03:14:29] <MootPoot> next one was now assume there is more then M and F

[03:15:51] <Satin> and go through an object's .gender
[03:15:54] <Satin> or whatever ig

[03:16:02] <Satin> and collect all the unique ones

[03:16:18] <MootPoot> first loop finds out the unqiues, puts them in a list , second loops through and checks and adds 
[03:16:20] <MootPoot> then just log

[04:50:38] <Fenderbassist> how goes it with the guitar? having fun with it?
[04:50:54] <JesseDesu> not at the moment
[04:51:06] <Fenderbassist> well it's always there when the mood strikes
[04:51:06] <JesseDesu> i played for 2 hours straight on christmas
[04:51:10] <JesseDesu> then i put it down
[04:51:17] <Fenderbassist> you were doing quite well with that minor pentatonic scale run
[04:51:31] <JesseDesu> thats my favorite thing to do
[04:54:10] <JesseDesu> i know it all the way up and down the neck
[04:54:23] <JesseDesu> i cant make it sound very musical tho
[04:55:47] <Fenderbassist> you will in time

[04:56:08] <Fenderbassist> right now you're doing the best thing you can, becoming familiar on the technical side
[04:56:28] <Fenderbassist> my first year was just learning basic notes to play simple songs, and getting started on the scales and modes
[04:56:40] <Fenderbassist> it all clicks after a while, just like with other art forms
[04:56:46] <JesseDesu> i dont know what notes i'm playing
[04:56:48] <Fenderbassist> no one earns their black belt right away
[04:56:58] <JesseDesu> i know the shape of the scales in every position
[04:57:04] <Fenderbassist> and that's a great start
[04:57:15] <Fenderbassist> you can watch videos on YouTube to help with learning the notes on the fretboard
[04:57:28] <Fenderbassist> or use images that you can websearch showing you what they all are

[05:00:50] <Fenderbassist> JesseDesu: that is perfectly fine, no one is to be expected to master everything in their life, some hobbies are just for fun

[07:00:48] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: during the summer it can be light up till like 7pm
[07:00:50] <Cryowolf> that says nothing about the south vs north location which in Japans geographical point has a much more dramatic difference afaik
[07:01:15] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: well it is near Tokyo
[07:01:20] <Cryowolf> here in the summer the sun begins to set at maybe 21:45
[07:01:24] <ButterNoodle> whatcha talkin bout
[07:01:42] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: short days
[07:01:45] <ButterNoodle> Cryowolf: u live near the equator?
[07:01:54] <Cryowolf> no then it would set at 6pm
[07:02:04] <Cryowolf> and rise at 6am
[07:02:06] <ButterNoodle> huh
[07:02:14] <Cryowolf> I live in Sweden
[07:02:34] <ButterNoodle> I dont think thats how it works
[07:02:41] <Cryowolf> short days in the winter, very long ones in the summer
[07:02:46] <ButterNoodle> yes
[07:03:25] <ewong> Sadale: ah.. so you were made an op on fn..  still belated congrats then. 
[07:03:32] * MootPoot is BCC spamming jobs
[07:03:37] <MootPoot> ok
[07:03:39] <ButterNoodle> big
[07:03:40] <MootPoot> applied for lets see
[07:03:42] <ButterNoodle> black
[07:03:44] <MootPoot> 35 jobs in 2 emaisl
[07:03:46] <ButterNoodle> cock? MootPoot ?
[07:03:49] <MootPoot> yes
[07:03:53] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, it kind of is, with very small changes
[07:03:55] <MootPoot> thats what they all are gonna get 
[07:03:59] <MootPoot> if they dont gimme money
[07:04:05] <ButterNoodle> bcc.. oh
[07:04:27] <Cryowolf> of course not with summer time and winter time
[07:04:46] <Cryowolf> so I guess it would be 6am and 7am, 6pm and 7pm (ish, always ish)
[07:04:56] <Cryowolf> always 12 hour days though
[07:05:48] <MootPoot> how do i talk to a recruiter
[07:05:56] <MootPoot> like - i tried messaging some on linkedin
[07:06:02] <MootPoot> they dont reply
[07:06:38] <Cryowolf> You could always work through a manpower supplying company. Though you don't get to negotiate a salary with the company you're at, because you're not working for them
[07:06:51] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: ur advances are unwanted
[07:07:08] <Cryowolf> the manpower company would be paying you a salary that could be worse or better than the one others have at the same position at the company you're sent to
[07:07:21] <Cryowolf> they don't charge you, because the company pays them, they take a % and then pay you
[07:08:58] <MootPoot> fuck it , I'll advance anyway
[07:09:00] <MootPoot> :3
[07:09:46] <Cryowolf> you can't, a clause at the manpower company prevents you from jumping over
[07:09:54] <Cryowolf> or taking a job at the company they supplied you to
[07:10:03] <Cryowolf> for a certain timeframe
[07:11:46] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: does BCCing like 
[07:11:50] <MootPoot> does the reciving client know?
[07:11:55] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I need to take tomako to the ear nose and throat doctor, she has had continuous ringing of the ear for one day
[07:11:59] <MootPoot> that it got Bcc'ed 
[07:12:05] <MootPoot> like - will it get spammed?
[07:12:08] <amigojapan> Hey MootPoot 
[07:12:10] <MootPoot> hey amigojapan 
[07:13:12] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: sorry to hear that, hope they can figure it out
[07:13:29] <amigojapan> Yeah Fenderbassist 
[07:14:08] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: u need to find a recruiter that will sit down and talk to you
[07:14:13] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, sounds like an ear infection, or internal pressure from something. Hopefully that's all
[07:14:23] <ButterNoodle> try teksystems
[07:14:51] <amigojapan> I hope so Cryowolf , something simple
[07:14:54] <Sxem> tinnitus

[07:15:10] <MootPoot> uh
[07:15:15] <MootPoot> idk
[07:15:19] <amigojapan> Yeah it could be tinnitus Sxem

[07:15:52] <ButterNoodle> 1st who cares f2f
[07:15:58] <ButterNoodle> 2nd they call you
[07:16:02] <ButterNoodle> :)
[07:16:03] <amigojapan> Ouch Sxem 
[07:16:18] * ButterNoodle hopes they have phones in canada
[07:17:02] <MootPoot> with recruiters, is it different if they call you vs the jobs listed on their site?
[07:17:08] <ButterNoodle> oh boy
[07:17:28] <MootPoot> I've had one f2f face with a recrutier that called me before
[07:17:44] <MootPoot> I looked at some other common recuirters but their websites have like 2
[07:17:45] <MootPoot> jobs
[07:17:52] <ButterNoodle> this fart sounded like a poulan chainsaw boggin down on a thicc log of hickory
[07:17:53] <MootPoot> idk
[07:18:16] <ButterNoodle> smells like blue cheese and chicken...
[07:18:20] <ButterNoodle> absolutely wonderful
[07:18:24] <Cryowolf> MootPoot, create Swedens system. We have a central government organized agency responsible for finding you a job
[07:18:32] <Cryowolf> or well helping you
[07:18:40] <MootPoot> there is a govt job board I used
[07:18:43] <MootPoot> looking elsewehre now
[07:18:48] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: if u just fire off ur cv, it will get added to the pile when -they- need you
[07:19:07] <ButterNoodle> if u call them they will think of u first when the opportunity arrives
[07:19:20] <MootPoot> hmm
[07:19:59] <ButterNoodle> I was making at least 20 calls a day when I was out of work at the start of covid
[07:21:16] <ButterNoodle> *that number quickly went down over the course of a few weeks bc not that many jobs out there..
[07:22:26] <MootPoot> from what I hear there is plenty of work
[07:26:27] <Satin> h
[07:29:32] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: unless I cancel my work for today tomako will need to wait till Monday. But she does not want me to cancel the work
[07:29:49] <Satin> watch says 2521 calories burned today
[07:30:08] <Satin> and i haven't really eaten so
[07:30:23] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: how much is she suffering at the moment?
[07:30:28] <Fenderbassist> Satin: you probably should eat
[07:30:46] <Fenderbassist> Satin: weight loss and fitness is a slow and gradual thing, not to be forced in huge spurts
[07:30:46] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: got some new songs tonight
[07:31:02] <Satin> You're right
[07:31:08] <Satin> I'll eat tomorrow though
[07:31:12] <Fenderbassist> you'll run yourself down
[07:31:29] <Fenderbassist> better to keep yourself functioning for school/work/exercise
[07:31:38] <amigojapan> Fenderbassist: I don't know how to quantify it. She says I should work. And she said we should avoid cooking
[07:31:41] <Fenderbassist> vs starvation which will only rob you of muscle mass
[07:31:54] <Fenderbassist> amigojapan: that sounds odd
[07:32:12] <Fenderbassist> for her sake, I would reschedule the work and take her to the doctor
[07:32:13] <MootPoot> Fenderbassist: I've been telling her tthat 
[07:32:17] <MootPoot> She won't listen 
[07:32:28] <MootPoot> she's trying to persue massive loss
[07:32:30] <Fenderbassist> MootPoot: you were right to say so
[07:32:50] <Fenderbassist> Satin: you will not lose weight in a healthy manner by exercising during starvation

[07:38:24] <Fenderbassist> if you're talking dumbbell bicep curls

[07:38:37] <Satin> ooh gotcha
[07:38:42] <Fenderbassist> standard curls, or hammer curls, or concentration curls
[07:38:47] <Satin> Uhhh

[18:44:20] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, yep. I use it on animeVPS
[18:45:02] <Sadale> Back when I tinkered with docker I used alpine for that as well.
[18:45:24] <ButterNoodle> what are ur thoughts on getting rid of busybox and using proper binaries? ik thats kinda defeating the purpose of an embedded light install.. but want proper tools like ps and kill
[18:45:26] <Sadale> Now that I just figure out that docker isn't something that I want to use. I prefer the old school sysadmin. Installin packages manually and shit :P
[18:45:41] <ButterNoodle> yea there is a time and place for docker
[18:45:47] <Sadale> ButterNoodle, no idea. You could try if you want.

[18:54:55] <ezekielnoob2> ah i had to study it myself

[18:55:36] <ezekielnoob2> 10 years ago i work for a photo studio, so i also had some experience from photosho already
[18:55:49] <Sadale> ahh. That's why. lucky you
[18:55:52] <ezekielnoob2> Sadale i'll search, there's good ones i can recommend
[18:55:56] <ezekielnoob2> i just don't have 1 specific 1

[18:57:08] <ezekielnoob2> Sadale alright will send u once  i gather them
[18:57:10] <JesseDesu> i want to do better tho
[18:57:29] <Sadale> ezekielnoob2, So I'd rather to get advise from an actual professionals like you <3
[18:57:40] <ezekielnoob2> JesseDesu usually you want to hae a large light source relative to the subject
[18:57:46] <ezekielnoob2> that one in particular seems to use a large light
[18:58:02] <JesseDesu> what can i get on amazon
[18:58:06] <ezekielnoob2> the lighting of that looks simple, but his camera angle make it seem like a real jet JesseDesu
[18:58:21] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: cum
[18:58:27] <Sadale> cum
[18:58:31] <ezekielnoob2> JesseDesu do you have like a DSLR that you can use flash?
[18:58:34] <JesseDesu> ii'm gonna shoot pinhole style
[18:58:43] <JesseDesu> its got flash
[18:58:44] <MootPoot> woah JesseDesu flashes people in public?
[18:58:50] <JesseDesu> .
[18:58:52] <JesseDesu> smh
[18:58:54] <ezekielnoob2> JesseDesu is it off camera flash that you can trigger remotely?
[18:58:57] <Sadale> ezekielnoob2, FYI: I ended up getting a phone for taking photos. It's more compact and it's cheaper than a camera xD
[18:59:06] <MootPoot> Sadale: perv
[18:59:10] <ezekielnoob2> Sadale phones are amazing nowadays
[18:59:13] <JesseDesu> i dont use the flash so i dont know what you mean
[18:59:14] <MootPoot> I bet you post lewds
[18:59:26] <ezekielnoob2> they can even gie you better looking photos than unprocessed DSLR shots
[18:59:35] <Sadale> technically speaking, it's not as good as camera. But I need it compact.
[18:59:55] <ezekielnoob2> JesseDesu make sure to diffuse the light
[19:00:09] <ezekielnoob2> just like how light becomes less harsh when it's cloudy
[19:00:10] <Sadale> So it's a compromise. Anyway I don't think that the technicality matters that much. A good photographer can take good photo with a crappy camera/phone
[19:00:17] <JesseDesu> the bigger the better right
[19:00:19] <ezekielnoob2> Sadale exactly
[19:00:28] <Jigsy> [15:30:17] <JesseDesu> the bigger the better right
[19:00:30] <ezekielnoob2> JesseDesu not always, it depends on the creative look you want
[19:00:36] <Jigsy> It's not the size that matters, its how you use it.
[19:00:37] <ezekielnoob2> the bigger light will give you a softer look
[19:00:42] <JesseDesu> what if i get a cheapo flood light
[19:00:51] <JesseDesu> from the hardware store
[19:00:51] <ezekielnoob2> soemtimes you want a contrasty shot tho, so you have to make a smaller light source
[19:00:56] <ezekielnoob2> or change the angle of the light
[19:01:05] <ezekielnoob2> JesseDesu that's gonna work too :)
[19:01:15] <ezekielnoob2> whatever source you have, just make sure you control it
[19:01:18] <ezekielnoob2> diffuse
[19:01:28] <JesseDesu> diffuse with a plastic bag
[19:01:37] <JesseDesu> translucent
[19:01:39] <Sadale> lol
[19:01:44] <Sadale> Wouldn't that be uneven?
[19:01:51] <ezekielnoob2> JesseDesu i suggest you use like cloth first
[19:01:52] <ezekielnoob2> or paper
[19:02:13] <ezekielnoob2> although i have quite some expensive lighting gear, i can still pull this off with cheap light
[19:02:20] <ezekielnoob2> it just makes things easier for me

[19:03:18] <ezekielnoob2> you can even use a bulb
[19:03:33] <ezekielnoob2> u just have to figure out a way to move it around
[19:03:40] <JesseDesu> i spent all my money on airbrush equipment
[19:03:53] <JesseDesu> ideally i want something the simulates the sun
[19:04:05] <JesseDesu> ie paralax lighting
[19:04:13] <JesseDesu> or whatever its called
[19:04:20] <ezekielnoob2> it's all about the diffuser
[19:04:30] <ezekielnoob2> and the distance also of your subject from teh light source
[19:04:53] <ezekielnoob2> heck you can probably even use your flash right now without diffuser
[19:05:01] <ezekielnoob2> maybe bounce the light off the ceiling
[19:05:09] <JesseDesu> i want to spend money on a canvas background, overhead mount, and the light itself
[19:05:10] <ezekielnoob2> JesseDesu what about, using the real sun?
[19:05:18] <ezekielnoob2> i mean can't you jsut hsoot outside also?

[19:08:48] <ezekielnoob2> Sadale inorder to even it out, eitehr: increase the size of the source OR increase the distance of the source from the background
