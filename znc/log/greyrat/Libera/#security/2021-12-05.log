[03:09:39] <joe7057> hi! What's up?
[03:10:00] <Kaylah> I'm good, how about you?
[03:10:19] <joe7057> I'm alright
[03:11:28] <Kaylah> cool
[03:11:51] <Kaylah> I am trying to learn about digital fingerprints, right now particularly reading on the 'hash of canvas fingerprint'
[03:12:15] <Kaylah> on the website https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/ it gives the following description:
[03:12:15] <websec> ^ Cover Your Tracks
[03:12:30] *** Quits: ss4 (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot) (Quit: Leaving)
[03:12:31] <Kaylah> "A tracker can create a “canvas” in your browser, and generate a complicated collage of shapes, colors, and text using JavaScript. Then, with the resulting collage, the tracker extracts data about exactly how each pixel on the canvas is rendered. Many variables will affect the final result. These include your operating system, graphics card,
[03:12:32] <Kaylah> firmware version, graphics driver version, and installed fonts."
[03:13:14] <Kaylah> do I understand it right that this tracker takes sort of a screenshot of your browser and then checks how each pixel is rendered, is that what this canvas is, a screenshot (i.e. an image)?
[03:14:33] <EdFletcher> Kaylah: correct, it combines as many unique attributes about the browser as possible to generate a "fingerprint" used for tracking
[03:14:50] <joe7057> This is just one of many sneaky forms of tracking
[03:15:02] <Kaylah> or is it perhaps like this: the canvas asks your browser how it would display a set of shapes, colors and text, for instance "a green triangle with red text on it", and then the browser responds with how it would display that exactly, so with information about each pixel
[03:15:58] <Kaylah> so it's as if you (the tracker) would ask an artist "draw a painting of a man in the city at night" and then the artist (the browser) gives you that painting, and then you start analyzing how exactly he painted it
[03:16:02] <Kaylah> is that a correct analogy?
[03:16:03] <critr> old chinese saying... "the nail that sticks out is the one that gets hammered." same goes for browsers.
[03:16:05] <joe7057> For example, there was another one a year or so ago where a website would cause a massive number of websites, where some would leave favicons and others would not. Then in future when you went through the redirects again, your browser will only request the favicons it doesn't have. This could be used to effectively give your browser a binary ID number
[03:16:18] <joe7057> yes, basically
[03:16:18] *** Quits: queue- (~nerd@user/queue/x-7267619) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:16:40] <Kaylah> and of course most artists (most browsers) would paint the same thing, but all in a different way
[03:16:45] <joe7057> honestly if you are really concerned about privacy, I would suggest you simply disable javascript by default, and only enable it where absolutely needed
[03:17:21] *** Quits: phost (~phost@162.198.54.77.rev.vodafone.pt) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[03:17:57] <Kaylah> hmm well I'm actually attempting to prevent myself from being recognized at a particular website, but it does require javascript
[03:18:09] <Kaylah> I've already tried disabling it but then the website didn't work anymore for me
[03:18:21] <joe7057> what security measures are you using?
[03:18:52] *** Joins: queue (~nerd@rektnet.com)
[03:18:55] <xx> which european country has good privacy laws that protect vpn providers and their customers?
[03:19:09] <Kaylah> I've also already tried taking into account a lot of other things, for instance I use a VPN to change my country, I use the Tor browser in private mode, I change the timezone and region settings of my computer to correspond with my VPN's connection
[03:19:15] <Kaylah> and I change the resolution of my screen
[03:19:30] <Kaylah> so I change all of those things every time I connect to the website, but it still recognizes me
[03:19:51] <joe7057> and what is your threat model? I.E. what kind of adversaries are you concerned about? Just advertisers, or others?
[03:20:00] <joe7057> how do you know that it recognizes you?
[03:20:03] <Kaylah> so I'm thinking it must be using this hash of canvas fingerprint and/or hash of webgl fingerprint
[03:20:34] *** Quits: led_belly (~led_belly@5.180.62.219) (Remote host closed the connection)
[03:20:57] <Kaylah> in some cases it just automatically brings me to a certain page, that only happens for recognized users
[03:21:10] <EdFletcher> there are companies such as https://fingerprintjs.com/ that offer proprietary "methods beyond fingerprinting" for user identification as well. this is a seriously tough battle to fight.
[03:21:10] <websec> ^ FingerprintJS Pro - Browser fingerprinting and fraud detection API
[03:21:30] <Kaylah> at other times, when I try to register with a new e-mail address, it actually says "you already have an account here with this e-mail address:" and then it actually shows an address I've previously used
[03:22:47] <joe7057> okay that is super creepy. Are you okay to share what website this is? Also are you inputing any other info, such as a username?
[03:23:06] <Kaylah> so right now I'm just going through the list of characteristics listed by the 'cover your tracks' website and seeing what might still be identifying me
[03:23:07] <joe7057> Have you checked if the site has set any cookies? (This should not be an issue with tor browser)
[03:23:15] <devmr02> have you actualy cleand your cookies?
[03:23:45] <Kaylah> I noticed that when cookies are disabled, the website doesn't work
[03:23:54] <Kaylah> but I do remove them every time of course
[03:23:59] <joe7057> I don't mean disabled, I mean cleared
[03:24:07] <devmr02> what browser?
[03:24:26] <Kaylah> I tried multiple browsers, chrome incognito, edge private mode, firefox private mode, and Tor private mode

[03:24:52] <Kaylah> the second time I visited the website, I used Edge I think, and then it didn't recognize me though
[03:25:08] <Kaylah> it also did work a third time once when I changed my time zone and everything
[03:25:32] <Kaylah> but after that I couldn't visit it without being recognized, even despite all of the measures I listed
[03:25:37] <Kaylah> it is, yes
[03:25:41] <Kaylah> but I do use a VPN
[03:26:35] <Kaylah> so the things I've been changing so far on every connection attempt are: VPN connection, screen resolution, browser (always in the private/incognito mode though), time zone of computer, region of computer
[03:26:39] *** queue is now known as queue-
[03:27:05] <joe7057> hold on, so is it identifying you across multiple browsers?
[03:27:12] <devmr02> what vpn? some like the google one are not real vpns
[03:27:34] <Hydragyrum> is it using some sort of supercookie?
[03:27:39] <joe7057> Try installing a new browser (the brave browser is decent for privacy, maybe try that one) and see if it recognizes you there the first time you visit the site. Use private mode.
[03:28:05] <Kaylah> so I'm going down the list of characteristics on ''cover your tracks" now, and they are all either already on the list of things that I change, or they are just very non-unique, except for 'hash of canvas fingerprint' 'hash of webgl fingerprint' and 'webgl vendor & renderer'
[03:28:19] <Kaylah> I'm using the paid version of Cyberghost as my VPN
[03:28:22] <Kaylah> so I think it should be fine
[03:28:34] <devmr02> yeah
[03:29:02] <Kaylah> Is the brave browser something like Tor then?

[03:32:26] <joe7057> drank[m]: it is just to test if the site will identify him when first visited from a new browser. Because if it doesn't, then their tracking is isolated to a browser. But if it does, then it is somehow tying him to their computer

[03:38:28] <Hash> OOPS
[03:38:36] <Kaylah> I've seen that there are plugins or something to disguise your canvas fingerprint (or to change it every time you visit a website)
[03:38:44] <Kaylah> would that be a likely shot at fixing the issue then?
[03:38:44] <Hash> So I wonder the other meanings, they didn't list them.
[03:38:57] <Hash> As it gained traction, Brave confirmed that they’ve been aware of the DNS leak since January 2021 when it was reported to its HackerOne-run bounty program. According to reports, Brave's internal ad blocker component was responsible for inadvertently leaking the .onion domains.
[03:39:13] <Hash> That's one example so far of a DNS leak.
[03:39:36] <ajak> (you've not provided the example)
[03:39:57] <joe7057> Kaylah it depends on if the plugin is trustworthy (assuming you wouldn't want the plugin developer to know you are visiting this site). Ideally at the minimum pick one that is fully open-source
[03:40:21] <Kaylah> I wouldn't mind the plugin developer to know that though
[03:40:38] <joe7057> Hash noone here is recommending brave for tor access. As usual, the recommendation is to always use the tor browser for accessing tor
[03:40:40] <Hash> Kaylah: you can fake that information.
[03:40:53] <joe7057> Kaylah in that case look for one with decent reviews
[03:40:54] <Hash> joe7057: Thank you
[03:41:00] <Kaylah> alright, will do
[03:41:06] <Hash> I just wanted to plant the flag here
[03:41:06] <joe7057> Hash no worries
[03:41:10] <Hash> So everyone can see it waving clearly
[03:41:16] <Hash> Use Tor browser
[03:41:17] <critr> the best way to not be fingerprinted is to look just like most other people on the internet. anything different about you makes you more identifyable.
[03:41:47] <Hash> This is why a VM tor browser is helpful because you only get the vm hardware and nothing else reported in the fingerprint.
[03:41:49] <ajak> and the best way to do that is probably by using the tor browser, since that's what it's designed for
[03:41:51] <Kaylah> well basically what my main questions here are: is it likely that the hash canvas fingerprint and hash webgl fingerprint are indeed the characteristics that give my identity away to the website
[03:42:04] <Hash> It would be best to run tor or any other security browsing on non local hardware
[03:42:09] <joe7057> Kaylah honestly it is difficult to know
[03:42:09] <Kaylah> and secondly: would a tool to cover that information be likely of solving the issue
[03:42:11] <ajak> Hash: using a virtual machine makes you rather unique but websites don't actually have visbility into that
[03:42:13] <Hash> That way fingerprinting is from the VM
[03:42:29] <ajak> so it should matter unless you already think the tor browser is compromised
[03:42:50] <critr> tor browser defaults to javascript enabled. turn it off.
[03:42:52] <joe7057> @ajak Kaylah if you want a VM consider looking into Whonix. It even has a live mode where nothing is saved from the previous session.
[03:42:53] <xx> Kaylah: it will not immediatelly tell the website who you are, but if you connect to the website using Tor browser and afterwards a regular browser, it might help link those two identities
[03:42:56] <Kaylah> I'm also doing all of this on a completely new computer by the way
[03:43:07] <xx> or if you connect to it across two separate sessions, it will also link them together
[03:43:11] <Kaylah> what is a VM, if I may ask?

[03:45:21] <Hash> For browsing I like elinks or links
[03:45:21] <EdFletcher> Kaylah: you could run a VM in a cloud provider and therefore on their connection, to completely separate yourself from the traffic your generating (unless that cloud provider is subpoenaed for your records)
[03:45:47] <xx> Kaylah: keep in mind that if you're the only one who changes those two defaults, then you stand out from the dataset
[03:45:58] <xx> it might not be an issue, or it may - it is an area of active research
[03:46:13] <Kaylah> hmm yes, but how would they know that I'm changing them?
[03:46:25] <xx> well if you have it disabled, then they know you have it disabled
[03:46:50] <EdFletcher> yeah and if you're the only data point with both disabled in a large data set, you'll stand out like a sore thumb outlier
[03:46:55] <xx> and if they see you're coming from a Tor exit node, but have those things disabled compared to the other users, then you're uniquely trackable across sessions compared to other Tor users
[03:47:02] <Kaylah> ah okay, I'm actually not sure how that tool will work though: would it just stop the information from being sent to the website, or would it send out some fake information

[04:42:50] *** Quits: Auron (~Auron956@user/auron) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:43:00] <Kaylah> I just did some tests with the extension 'canvas blocker'
[04:43:10] *** Quits: sdfgsdfg (~sdfgsdfg@user/sdfgsdfg) (Quit: ZzzZ)
[04:43:12] <Kaylah> in google chrome
[04:43:59] <Kaylah> I went to the 'coveryourtracks' website multiple times, each time with different circumstances, and checked what value it returned under 'hash of canvas fingerprint' and 'hash of webgl fingerprint'
[04:44:01] *** Joins: hololeap (~hololeap@user/hololeap)
[04:44:53] <Kaylah> I noticed that using the tor browser sets the values of both these characteristics to "randomized", so it's not like it sends out a fake value or something (I think), so the website actually knows that you're trying to hide it or something
[04:45:20] <Kaylah> so I suspect that the website simply blocks connections that have this "randomized" value
[04:45:52] *** Joins: ElectronApps (~ElectronA@user/electronapps)
[04:46:45] <Kaylah> I also noticed that with the canvas blocker on and set to 'random fingerprint' or 'random fingerprint (per session)', it returns respectively "randomized" and "randomized by first party domain" for the hash of canvas fingerprint, and it doesn't have any effect on the hash of webgl fingerprint
[04:46:54] *** Quits: maroloccio (~marolocci@151.53.155.184) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0)
[04:47:30] <Kaylah> but if I set the canvas blocker to the last setting, which is 'fixed fingerprint', then it actually gives a value instead of just "randomized", and it's a different value than the (real) one when I don't use the extension
[04:47:49] <Kaylah> so this last option might be the best way to 'trick' the website into not recognizing me
[04:48:08] <Kaylah> unless of course they use the 'hash of webgl fingerprint'
[04:48:43] <Kaylah> but bottom line is that the Tor browser seems to just tell them "I hide all of this information", and that might be enough for the website to say "fine then go away"

[04:49:52] <Kaylah> so if my hypothesis is correct, the website didn't recognize me at all when I used Tor, it just knew that I was using something like Tor to hide myself, and decided to not let me through because of that
