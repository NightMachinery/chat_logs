[00:09:26] <buttsbot> Twitter - planet4589 - For those asking: yes, an old Falcon 9 second stage left in high orbit in 2015 is going to hit the moon on March 4. It's interesting, but not a big deal.

[00:17:12] <imode> goodest boi
[00:21:18] <manicennui> So we've been talking about this really trivial database update of 35k rows for several days now. I finally convinced them just to execute the damn thing instead of all of these other solutions that people came up with. It executed in 2 seconds.
[00:22:04] <riv> hahahahaha
[00:23:22] <manicennui> DBAs gave us a hard time about it. I suggested that we just have an SRE do it in Rails console.
[00:23:47] <manicennui> SREs at this company save our ass all the time.
[00:24:07] <manicennui> Never worked at a place where I have to do so little in production.

[00:58:09] <manicennui> WASHINGTON -- COVID-19 antibody drugs from Regeneron and Eli Lilly should no longer be used because they don't work against the omicron variant that now accounts for nearly all U.S. infections, U.S. health regulators said Monday.
[00:59:13] <manicennui> The regulatory move was expected because both drugmakers had said the infusion drugs are less able to target omicron due to its mutations. Still, the federal action could trigger pushback from some Republican governors who have continued promoting the drugs against the advice of health experts.
[00:59:25] <manicennui> Ah yes. Republican medicine.

[01:10:02] <manicennui> What should it do?
[01:12:49] <gwozniak> manicennui: I love that kind of update.  Tons of concern over an update that doesn't really affect anything
[01:13:26] <manicennui> gwozniak: I honestly think it came down to different groups not wanting to do any work.
[01:13:48] <manicennui> The last suggested solution required no work from any of us, but left the data in a ridiculous state instead of just fixing it.
[01:14:51] <gwozniak> Ah, so the other kind where the update is simple but no one wants to do it
[01:15:48] <gwozniak> My cat is chasing a stray piece of string around my office and it's remarkably cute
[01:16:45] <gwozniak> Test team filed a bug and I'm 100% certain it's a test setup problem.  The hard part is convincing them of that

[01:34:19] <manicennui> companion_cube: I'm watching a crazy YT video where French people are telling this woman that they don't like beef bourguignon.
[01:53:48] <bontaq> hmm, is it normal for a squad / team lead to run retros / planning / breakdown?
[01:54:35] <manicennui> I don't think it is uncommon.
[01:54:45] <indigo> Sure, our TL runs sprints
[01:55:02] <indigo> We don't have retros except for product launches
[01:55:25] <manicennui> I don't tend to run such things, but I tend to do a lot of the talking.
[01:55:43] <manicennui> For stand-up and retros I have the team rotate and do them.
[01:56:09] <manicennui> Our story times and IPMs are usually run by the PM.
[01:57:58] <bontaq> interesting, I thought it was a PM's zone
[01:58:14] <manicennui> bontaq: Ideally anyone could do it.
[01:58:29] <manicennui> Obviously the PM would bring requests from business.
[01:59:17] <manicennui> In the past I have also done retros without PMs and managers.
[01:59:23] <manicennui> So people can bitch about them if they want.
[01:59:40] <manicennui> Right now our PM and manager are pretty good, so it isn't necessary.
[02:00:29] <manicennui> Things run a lot better when you all treat each other like adults.
[02:00:57] <bontaq> right yeah, they're just introducing the concept of squad / team leads here and I got caught up on "but then what's that leave them?"
[02:01:15] <bontaq> and me thinking they love their lil sprint ceremonies
[02:01:56] <manicennui> Most of the ceremonies are for the benefit of others, but retros should be a place where you can actually discuss things you want to improve on the team.
[02:17:05] <manicennui> This should be good: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30077959
[02:17:06] <buttsbot> Why our team cancelled our move to microservices | Hacker News
[02:23:25] <bontaq> aw dang we didn't have a chance to move to microservices yet and they're already cancelled?
[02:25:14] <manicennui> Sorry, microservices are a sex pest.
[02:29:58] <gerikson> I cancelled my move to microservices ebfore it was cool
[02:31:27] <manicennui> I'll just wait for monoliths to become a fad.
[02:32:59] <manicennui> "Once everything started getting hard, and the clear path forward started to get lost, we paused, and realized we didn’t know why we were doing any of this. We didn’t have a list of our pain points, and we had no clear understanding of how this would help solve any pain points we do have. Worse, microservices might be just about to create a whole set of new problems for us."
[02:33:03] <manicennui> That pretty much sums it up.
[02:35:18] <bontaq>  "Going from a monolith to a micro-service setup is essentially my idea of a Christian hell. Swirling depths of pain and uncertainty interspersed with screaming and urgency. There is no rest. No one knows when it will end." lmao a bit intense
[02:35:46] <manicennui> "Once we looked past the stereotypes and branding, the development team had very few issues with our 'monolith.' It might have been one of the most pain-free parts of our entire system."
[02:35:49] <manicennui> That is our experience.
[02:35:55] <manicennui> But people continue to push for more services.
[02:36:08] <manicennui> Our biggest actual problem with the monolith is releasing.
[02:36:14] <manicennui> But we manage to release it multiple times per day.
[02:37:10] <companion_cube> manicennui: good on them for stopping in time

[22:25:05] <manicennui> I was just thinking that maybe we should try to explain vaccines to idiots by comparing them to contraceptives, but I bet there are a lot of them who are against contraceptives too.
[22:25:26] <manicennui> I don't know why anyone believes that there is anything in medicine that is 100% effective.
[22:27:31] <gwozniak> Yeah, I see people bitching about vaccines not being 100% effective and saying "why do we have them?" all the time
[22:28:03] <gwozniak> It's as if people take everything they see in TV medical shows as gospel
[22:30:23] <manicennui> They should watch House.
[22:30:53] <manicennui> They are probably the same people who also want antibiotics when they have a cold.
[22:33:39] <companion_cube> there's some ads here, on busses and bus stops, that compare vaccines to seatbelts
[22:33:44] <companion_cube> not a bad comparison I think
[22:33:58] <kline> theres a good video of people rejecting seatbelts as well
[22:34:02] <kline> when they were introduced
[22:34:22] <manicennui> These people have the same excuses/arguments for everything over time.
[22:34:35] <companion_cube> kline: yeah, same kind of stupid

[22:35:11] <companion_cube> oh fuck, the indoor smoking
[22:35:40] <manicennui> My favorite recent meme was something like, "The government can't tell me what to do because the government 200 years ago already did."
[22:36:06] <companion_cube> nah, the constitution is given by god to this christian nation
[22:36:25] <manicennui> Of course they generally don't actually know what the authorities that they appeal to actually said or thought.
[22:36:36] <manicennui> They always just happen to agree with whatever position they have already settled on.
[22:36:38] <manicennui> Convenient.
[22:38:30] <manicennui> I like the places that require idiots to agree to never use a long list of common medications and medical procedures if they want a medical exception to the vaccine based on the fetal cell excuse.
[22:39:06] <companion_cube> yep, no tylenol for ya then!
[22:39:52] <manicennui> Tylenol isn't 100% effective for pain. They shouldn't be using it anyways.
[22:43:29] <companion_cube> and if you take too much you can die
[22:43:48] <manicennui> Pfft. You don't need a liver.
[22:44:03] <companion_cube> kline: that video is terrifying
[22:44:37] <companion_cube> I've learnt that schools here in the US don't show, like, car safety videos? to, erm, show people what accidents can look like?
[22:44:47] <manicennui> companion_cube: Watch some videos about desegregation and you'll see a lot of the same arguments that assholes use against all kinds of things today.
[22:45:29] <manicennui> It's against God, it's unnatural, etc, etc.
[22:45:34] <companion_cube> ah of course
[22:46:00] <manicennui> Right wingers resorting to violence.
[22:46:04] <manicennui> All the same plays.
[22:47:34] <companion_cube> ffs, how can you see this video and not wear a seatbelt
[22:47:56] <manicennui> It's my choice if I want to fly through your windshield.

[23:08:09] <Geekingfrog> I wonder what the would've happened if the drone crashed on the bear
[23:27:42] <manicennui> I wonder whether the bear is tame.
[23:27:48] <manicennui> And it is some weirdo in Russia.
[23:28:07] <manicennui> We can't really outrun bears.

[23:32:47] <gerikson> pretty sure they do...
[23:33:01] <manicennui> Yeah...
[23:33:10] <Brekkjern> Well, first of all their servers don't fit in a standard 19" rack.
[23:33:24] <manicennui> I don't know about Facebook in particular, but I've definitely seen articles about companies like Amazon writing custom networking code and such.
[23:33:53] <manicennui> And Facebook has their custom PHP. Not sure whether they have released everything that they use internally for that.
