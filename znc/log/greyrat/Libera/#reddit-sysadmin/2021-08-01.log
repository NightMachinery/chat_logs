[06:24:46] <jimender2> I prefer lxc over docker
[06:24:58] <haise01> Docker is based on tech that LXC uses iirc
[06:24:59] <sd> 11<tâ€‹elgareith> different purposes
[06:25:07] <sd> 11<tâ€‹elgareith> yes they both use namespaces

[06:25:34] <jimender2> lxc just seems more secure than docker
[06:25:48] <haise01> LXC is bigger PITA imo
[06:25:54] <haise01> you still have to patch hosts yourself
[06:25:58] <haise01> and maintain software inside

[07:29:13] <NardHog> Hi guys, just a quick question, what entry level sys admin certs do you guys have?
[07:30:04] <JollyRgrs> none
[07:30:06] <NardHog> I'm not sure to go with RHCSA or CCNA, and I haven't been able to find which cert my local employers prefer. The job listing only say x years of experience with y tech.
[07:30:16] <JollyRgrs> I mean, i technically have an A+, but that doesn't really count
[07:30:45] <NardHog> Did it matter when you applied for your current job?
[07:30:51] <JollyRgrs> NardHog: if you have yrs of exp., certs don't do much. if you have zero exp, certs can kinda help
[07:31:04] <JollyRgrs> do you have any other IT exp?
[07:31:19] <NardHog> Not really, mostly retail xp for me.
[07:31:44] <NardHog> If A+ worked for you, I'll probably look into that.
[07:32:33] <JollyRgrs> well, I worked geek squad (for way too many years)... i was one of only 2 who had A+ there (out of like 10-12)
[07:32:40] <JollyRgrs> so again... A+ doesn't really do much for ya
[07:32:48] <JollyRgrs> but you don't just "jump into" sysadmin jobs (usually)
[07:32:57] <JollyRgrs> and even if you can... you shouldn't
[07:33:12] <JollyRgrs> you'd be hard pressed to find a really good sysadmin who wasn't helldesk bitch first
[07:33:15] *** Quits: Roughy (~mdaw45ns@user/roughy) (Quit: Meadow Fresh milk)
[07:33:36] <NardHog> Yeah, I think I'll most likely get a helpdesk position first.
[07:33:47] <NardHog> But with nothing but retail on my resume, I haven't been getting interviews.
[07:33:58] <NardHog> Sounds like maybe A+ is the way to go.
[07:34:01] <JollyRgrs> the idea would be get your exp in at helpdesk, you should be proving your worth there, and as you escalate tickets to sysadmins, they'll notice your quality of troubleshooting and knowledge
[07:34:19] <JollyRgrs> yeah... A+ might help a bit then
[07:34:30] <NardHog> Thanks for your help, appreciate it.
[07:34:58] * zetorian also went GeekSquad helldesk sysadmin
[07:35:53] <JollyRgrs> A-YO!!!!
[07:36:00] <JollyRgrs> there's a few of us in here
[07:36:18] <JollyRgrs> zetorian: were you precinct or DA?
[07:36:42] <zetorian> Precinct, ~4 years
[07:36:55] <JollyRgrs> i was precinct, then DA.... for 8 yrs :(
[07:36:56] <zetorian> hbu?
[07:37:03] <JollyRgrs> i was so imposter syndromed
[07:37:42] <JollyRgrs> but when they did the massive layoffs (basically taking it down to a single PC DA in each city), I finally learnt I was more than prepared
[07:37:59] <zetorian> That sucks. I caught a lucky break at a University helpdesk that got me out. otherwise I'd have been there a lot longer.
[07:38:14] <zetorian> I'm glad you got the kick to get out of there
[07:38:25] <JollyRgrs> well, i was in it early on and was lost in the culture
[07:38:36] <JollyRgrs> lots of fun people (not so much locally, but nationally)
[07:39:06] <zetorian> That's for sure. they try really hard with the culture stuff.
[07:39:21] <JollyRgrs> when RS still had a hold on GS, things weren't so bad... but when the "take backs" clause ran out, it all went downhill
[07:39:37] <JollyRgrs> the culture stuff was top notch and not hokey at all
[07:40:01] <JollyRgrs> but that was with robert stephens branding it... as BBY crept in, it got bad
[07:40:27] *** Quits: NardHog (~nardhog@141.168.65.56) (Quit: Leaving)
[07:40:43] <zetorian> I came in around the time all that was going down. Fortunately we were a small district so it happened slow. was sad to watch the decline though
[07:41:59] <JollyRgrs> yeah
[07:42:11] <JollyRgrs> i grand opened a store that was happening right at nat'l rollout of geek squad
[07:42:30] <JollyRgrs> it really was fun, the geek squad forums were active and lively, the IRC Channel on efnet was fun
[07:43:00] <JollyRgrs> I got to meet a good number of agents when I went up to the magic castle for training and then when we did geek squad summer academy a few times
[07:43:06] <JollyRgrs> it was a blast
[07:43:58] <zetorian> I've heard stories. A couple of guys at my precinct had been around since the 'good ol days' and talked about it like it was magic
[07:43:59] *** Joins: NardHog (~nardhog@141.168.65.56)
[07:44:09] <JollyRgrs> it really was
[07:44:31] <JollyRgrs> if BBY only knew what they were taking away...
[07:44:37] <zetorian> It's sad to see corporations suck the life out of cool places like that
[07:44:45] <JollyRgrs> it was legit smart people (mostly) and the culture kept customer service (mostly) top notch
[07:44:57] <JollyRgrs> RS was brilliant in how he started and kept GS goign
[07:45:19] <JollyRgrs> but then BBY wanted to shove blue shirts in white shirts and shove white shirts back in PC sales
[07:45:37] <JollyRgrs> then they thought HT installers could do the same jobs of PC DAs
[07:46:08] <JollyRgrs> lol... nope, but so many HT installers became DFMs and really just kept promoting their own kind
[07:46:09] <zetorian> ugh. I got stuck as a 'Cumputer Sales Agent' for almost 6 months. it was agony.
[07:46:37] <zetorian> Hahahaha, that move really backfired on them after a while
[07:46:50] <JollyRgrs> yeah
[07:47:25] <zetorian> They finally stuck me back behind the counter when I was selling more ssd's than new computers.
[07:47:32] <JollyRgrs> if they wanted to figure out how to keep people coming into the stores and using GS... they shoulda not messed with it
[07:48:44] <zetorian> Were you still around when they started pushing the yearly plans like mad? it was crazy having to hit sales figures as an ARA.
[07:49:20] <zetorian> I didn't even talk to people most days, and they'd pass me for a raise cause my sales were bad
[07:51:09] <NardHog> What were your sales targets?
[07:51:34] <NardHog> I did tech sales for a while, a day's sale target was approx 8k.
[07:53:39] <zetorian> We were supposed to sell 1 year long tech support prescription every 4hrs
[07:53:59] <zetorian> they were $200 a pop by the end
[07:54:20] <NardHog> ouch, subscriptions and service plans were always the hardest.
[07:54:34] <NardHog> Most people at my store met our targets by pushing security systems.
[07:54:48] <zetorian> Ugh.. I hate sales so much
[07:55:05] <NardHog> I hate the assistant manager stealing my sales lol.
[07:55:21] <zetorian> don't get me started on that bull
[07:55:28] <NardHog> If it looked like a security system customer came in, he'll ask me to go tidy the shelves.
[07:55:29] <zetorian> I'll be ranting all night
[07:55:39] <NardHog> Or he'll straight up steal the customer whilst I was talking to them haha
[07:55:52] <NardHog> nah I'd be happy to hear some stories.
[07:56:10] <NardHog> The AM eventually got fired for committing fraud with the loyalty points and discounts.
[07:57:21] <zetorian> Alrighty.. We had one manager who informed us numbers weren't being counted for black Friday. then proceeded to sign in to every register for 'efficiency' and stole all sales for the first 5 hours before the gm caught on.
[07:57:32] <NardHog> LOL
[07:57:37] <zetorian> he took his gigantic bonus check and ran for the hills
[07:57:38] <NardHog> That guys got some big balls.
[07:57:59] <NardHog> Honestly, I kinda respect him for not giving a shit at all hahaha
[07:58:42] <zetorian> I mean, in hindsight it was kinda funny. but we were pissed
[07:59:17] <NardHog> At least no one would have been individually penalised for their KPIs.
[07:59:17] <zetorian> We went on a kilt strike. it was technically alowd as part of our uniform to wear neon orange kilts.
[07:59:22] <NardHog> Since everyone got screwed equally.
[07:59:31] <NardHog> hahahaha
[07:59:33] <zetorian> yea
[07:59:40] <NardHog> Kilt strike sounds amazing.
[08:00:15] <zetorian> that was fun. it went on for a week before they decided to let the whole thing slide and just give us all extra time off.
[08:00:20] <NardHog> Did corporate follow up wih the GM about that incident
[08:00:31] <zetorian> yea. he got canned
[08:00:33] <NardHog> It was his fault, not the staff's
[08:00:37] <NardHog> lol nice
[08:00:42] <NardHog> so happy ending all around
[08:01:10] <zetorian> not really. aside from being a bit aloof the gm was the only thing keeping that place afloat.
[08:01:25] <zetorian> I left 3 months later. store closed 5 after that
[08:01:55] <NardHog> Oh I thought he was a terrible GM, if he was otherwise good, then that really sucked.
[08:02:07] <NardHog> at least you got out before the ship sunk.
[08:02:28] <NardHog> For that job the GM of that store got fired few months after I left too.
[08:02:38] <NardHog> Not a great manager, but it was his first management job, first retail job too.
[08:02:57] <NardHog> He was a biz analyst before that.
[08:04:43] <zetorian> that'd be a difficult transition 
[08:05:31] <zetorian> Anything specific you're looking for transitoning into tech NardHog?
[08:05:56] <zetorian> like Win/Linux or something else entirely?
[08:06:14] <NardHog> I'm hoping to go into Helpdesk, then SysAdmin, then Sys Eng, and hopefully DevOps eng as the ultimate goal.
[08:06:39] <NardHog> Looking into getting AWS CSA-Professional if I can.
[08:06:47] <NardHog> Oh probably linux
[08:06:52] <NardHog> It's what I'm used to.
[08:06:59] <NardHog> Are you a windows or linux admin?
[08:08:44] <zetorian> I'm a linux admin for a webhosting company
[08:09:14] <NardHog> Does your company do everything in the cloud?
[08:09:26] <NardHog> I haven't come across a company that has their own physical servers these days.
[08:09:46] <zetorian> yea, we don't own hardware outside of company laptops
[08:10:09] <JollyRgrs> well, there's two parts to that
[08:10:35] <JollyRgrs> there's "data centers in the cloud" and then running serverless type things "in the cloud"
[08:10:57] <JollyRgrs> most bigger companies might even contract out their phys HW (mine does/did)...
[08:11:05] <JollyRgrs> but we're "moving everything to the cloud"
[08:11:11] <JollyRgrs> ... which is not really best
[08:11:25] <NardHog> I like what was supposed to be a decentralised system is becoming more and more centralised haha
[08:11:26] <JollyRgrs> the benefits of cloud isn't for all servers, it shouldn't be a blanket approach
[08:12:05] <zetorian> yea. and not having direct control can cause really odd ephermal errors.
[08:12:13] <NardHog> What my friends say that except for legislated requirements, none of their senior management want onsite hardware to deal with.
[08:12:43] <JollyRgrs> that's def. a benefit of "the cloud" as a DC
[08:13:00] <JollyRgrs> but you are not "getting rid of" headaches
[08:13:02] <JollyRgrs> just changing what they are
[08:13:56] <NardHog> yeah I heard that issues still come up, but the VP that pushed migrating to the cloud is really trumpeting how all our issues can be resolved by remote work now.
[08:14:25] <NardHog> But it wasn't like their problems were hardware related before the migration.
[08:14:33] <NardHog> Everything still got fixed remotely.
[08:15:11] <zetorian> I think it's more because vps like the simplicity of monthly contracts
[08:15:14] <JollyRgrs> moving "to the cloud" looks good on C-Level's resumes
[08:16:17] <NardHog> I think originally they subcontracted the management of their DC to a MSP anyway.
[08:16:33] <NardHog> So it's basically moving to AWS and freeing up office space.
[08:16:44] <NardHog> the ops guys still have the same workload

[23:35:48] <technonerd> ffmpeg cmds can get long and confusing
[23:38:09] <CableNinja> yep
[23:38:19] <CableNinja> thats why you alias or make shortcut scripts
[23:40:00] * gibby farts gibbyfarts.com
[23:49:18] <dragonfleas> doesn't that link to your minecraft server or something
[23:49:51] <CableNinja> technonerd, tbh it'd be nice if ffmpeg would accept like a json/yaml config to specify options from the commandline, like '--config /path/to/config.json'
