[15:41:50] <Guest93> Hello blkshp! Just like in the old freenode : )
[15:42:40] <Guest93> I just was told in the wikipedia-discord that everyone switched to libera chat and so I came here to look whether really everyone switched here :P
[15:44:16] *** Guest93 is now known as sepia
[15:45:04] <dukwon> in a few weeks, liberia might be larger than freenode in online user counts
[15:45:50] <sepia> I guess I could look somewhere which status I have, there was a plus and some letter to designate one's rights in irc, but I forget them always ...
[15:46:58] <dukwon> +R should be for registered, I think
[15:47:17] <dukwon> in the server messages tab I see [Jun 14 10:07:08] * dukwon sets modes [dukwon :+RZi]
[15:47:27] <dukwon> dunno what +Z and +i are
[15:48:37] <sepia> In freenode there was initially possible to chat without registration, but after some summer holidays they switched the rules due to spamming so that unregistered users could read, but nobody could read them except in the freenode-support-channel.
[15:51:03] <sepia> I'm glad that this restriction is obsolete here, it was a nuisance to look up the password for login if you only wanted to ask some short question, like "what's the difference between in 'in spite' and 'despite'?"

[18:16:18] <m1dnight> Grammarly keeps nagging me that the following sentence is in passive voice, but I really don't see how I can change it to active voice: "When the Intel 8086 was introduced in 1978, it boasted a 5 Megahertz clock speed and was paired with 128 kilobytes of \gls{RAM}.
[18:16:21] <m1dnight> "
[18:16:23] <m1dnight> Any tips?
[18:16:56] <darsie> When Intel introduced the 8086 ...
[18:17:07] <m1dnight> "Intel introduced the 8086 in 1976, and it boasted 5 mhz"?
[18:17:41] <darsie> MHz!
[18:18:22] <m1dnight> Oh, I see the pattern now. I'll check for some more.
[18:18:38] <m1dnight> darsie: yes, I know. I evern wrote it in full in my text, because apparently that's what you have to do.
[18:18:39] <darsie> I hate '$5 m'.
[18:18:44] <m1dnight> *even
[18:19:02] <m1dnight> Next task: learn how to use commas properly. I just do it based on gut feeling, but my gut feeling is really bad :')
[18:19:21] <darsie> Oh, that's an exercise?
[18:20:31] <m1dnight> No no, it's just me going through my text using grammarly.
[18:21:00] <drbean> From a US patent: "attached near the middle of the book between the primary and secondary leaves and adapted when *said book* is open to extend in .."
[18:21:01] <m1dnight> And since I don't have time to "study" grammar I just take for granted what people tell me. 
[18:21:18] <drbean> So "said book" without an article is OK.
[18:21:47] <darsie> When Intel introduced the 8086 in 1978 they paired it with 128 kB of RAM and it boasted 5 MHz clock speed.
