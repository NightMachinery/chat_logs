[02:32:10] <Enissay> The first doesnt request psw confirmation to switch to root while the second does as far as I can tell
[02:34:13] <wr> on debian if i have chrome + chromium and login with same account on both will it have chrome and chromium totally separated but the same account showing?
[02:34:26] <JackFrost> gumbo: In what aspect?  rmadison tells you about versions.
[02:35:27] <somiaj> Enissay: sudo will use the user password (or NOPASS if set in sudoers file). sudo also caches authentication, so you only have to enter in the password after not using sudo for a timeout.
[02:35:52] <somiaj> Enissay: su -, requires you to login(1) as root, so it will require the roots password, and authenticate using that.
[02:36:40] <somiaj> wr: chromium and google-chrome will use their own profile/cache directory, so you may have to setup some sort of account sync across chrome devices/machiens if you want them to be mroe similar

[04:32:55] <sceptttre> Hey all. I recently purchased an e-reader (Supernote) and its OS is some in-house Android fork. I wanted to transfer some files to it but I don't see the device when I plug it into my computer. Any ideas how I can "see" the device?
[04:33:15] <sceptttre> I googled quite a bit before I decided to ask and it mentions MTP
[04:33:37] <sceptttre> I found this program online that it's supposed to extract notes from the device https://github.com/jya-dev/supernote-tool
[04:33:58] <sceptttre> I see they're using fusepy to access the filesystem

[05:12:26] <Jaami> an application keep checking updates while i dont want no more updates. and uses port 80. i cannot block the port but do need to block the app.

[08:25:24] <Kerr> Yes, but It doesn't really have much to do with my question. I merely mentioned that because I wanted to include what version of debian I'm running, so anyone who might answer doesn't have to consider I might have an oldstable or something
[08:25:35] <viktor01330> i mean, either i can toggle my layout, or i can use the compose key. but never can do both

[15:44:55] <Milo> I need fresh ideas. I have lenovo thinkpad with Elan touchpad, which starts lagging crazily after resuming from sleep. rmmod i2c_hid && modprobe i2c_hid causes irq massive storm, which brings single core cpu usage to max. bullseye with everything up-to-date. Tested with 5.10.0-10 and testing 5.14.0-0 from bullseye-backports.
[15:45:10] *** Parts: hiya (~hiya@user/hiya) (WeeChat 3.0.1)
[15:45:26] <Milo> according to kernel bugzilla, it should have been fixed since 5.4: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203995

[15:46:32] <Milo> ircstorm doesn't show up in dmesg/journal, but /proc/interrupts shows massive non-stop flooding
[15:46:45] <Milo> irqstorm even :)
[15:47:10] <jelly> stupid workaround, use hibernation instead of suspend?
[15:48:29] <Milo> I could test that as a last measure
[15:48:54] <Milo> but that's only mildly better than actually shutting down the machine
[15:49:24] <PerfDave> That may be a useful diagnostic TBH - if it happens on suspend but not hibernate, that isolates a few paths within power management
[15:49:54] <PerfDave> Milo: Random guessing here because these things are never simple - is your system clock correct after resume?

[15:53:11] <Milo> hwclock and regular date are like half a second off
[15:53:12] <jelly> I have a third-party laptop power supply that only works after a power-on.  hotplugging at any point later does not do.  Learned to love hibernation.
[15:53:46] <jelly> also, waiting for actually USB-PD certified power supplies to arrive.
[15:54:20] <PerfDave> Urgh don't get me started on high-power protocols over USB-C
[15:54:59] <jelly> yes.  This one was cheap and did not say PD on the box, just USB-C.  I naively thought, what else could it be?
[15:55:35] *** Quits: bestucan (~weechat@45.87.95.106) (Quit: WeeChat 3.0)
[15:55:56] <jelly> aparently it's _something_ that this thinkpad allows when its battery is low and it's powered off, but $DEITY forbid you plug it in after it's been on for a bit
[15:56:16] <PerfDave> We've gone from having to match connectors on phones and laptops, to having to match power negotiation protocols. And those are harder to tell just by looking at the plug.

[15:57:07] <Milo> PerfDave I don't see the systemclock really going offsync really
[15:57:28] <PerfDave> Milo: OK. Literally just flinging ideas out for what may be causing your IRC storm
[15:57:30] <Milo> you know it's 'really' when you accidentally say 'really' twice
[15:57:31] <PerfDave> IRQ
[15:57:44] <Milo> glad I'm not the only one who keeps accidentally writing irc instead of irq
[15:58:10] <Milo> yeah, the irqstorm doesn't happen until rmmod && modprobe i2c_hid
[15:58:33] <jelly> funny how IRC only has floods, but interrupts have storms
[15:58:36] <Milo> but without the reprobing, the touchpad is unusable
[16:00:55] <Milo> so, I guess I'll test the hibernate next. ugh

[16:46:43] <Sensiva> Hello, I have an mdadm raid array and its read/write states aren't showing up in nmon. Any ideas what could be the reason for that?
[16:48:54] <sgon2> randall: thanks for your reply. As what I said in the previous post, my sound server works fine. So that means there is no problems on the volume part. I am not a native English speaker so I am not sure how to express this more clearly. My sound is working fine except popup window notification sound. I don't know what you mean by `notification
[16:48:54] <sgon2> sound set`. I don't find any problems on the notifications in system settings. Even if it has problem, I don't really recognize so far.
[16:49:25] <deadrom> Sensiva, how do you call nmon?
[16:49:47] <Sensiva> deadrom export NMON=d && nmon
[16:49:53] <Sensiva> OR: nmon then press d
[16:50:13] <sgon2> at0m: thanks for your comment. I don't find any problems on that Notfications setup. Everything is just default setup. I don't really know what to look for. There is no `kdialog` app to configure events in Notifications setup window.
[16:50:36] <deadrom> Sensiva, does it list individual disks? What is your goal?
[16:51:35] <Sensiva> deadrom yes it lists individual disks, but doesn't list md0 as it used to do. My goal is to see read/write rates of md0
[16:53:05] <sgon2> at0m: In the system settings Notifications setup window, I saw Applications: Configure button. After clicking it, it shows some kind of application list. There is `kdialog` in the application list though. I really don't know what to look for. I tried to check `Plasma Workspace` app in this configuration window and press `Configure Events`. I don't
[16:53:06] <sgon2> find any problems on Plasma Workspace.
[16:53:47] <deadrom> Sensiva, can't help with nmon really, but as a quick workaround maybe you could use stat? it can measure devices in intervals. Does not give you live data as such, though.
[16:54:16] <sgon2> There is **NO** `kdialog` in the application list though.
[16:54:19] <Sensiva> Thank you deadrom
[16:55:14] <sgon2> I missed an important word in the previous post. "There is **NO** `kdialog` in the application list though."
[16:55:39] <deadrom> Sensiva, nmon has been around some time, possibly the hardware abstraction of mdadm has changed in ways outside its reach. I'd ask the author or file a bug.
[16:56:14] <Sensiva> I will have to look deeper before doing that
[16:56:24] <jelly> Sensiva, do they show up in eg. "iostat -x 1"? (sysstat package)
[16:56:33] <sgon2> All I want is `kdialog --msgbox "abc"` should make a sound. It did make a sound in prevous kde versions in debian 10. After fresh installing debian 11 and kde 5.20.5, it just doesn't make sound anymore.
[16:56:56] <randall> sgon2: You can a different volume for firefox, vlc, and also the system sounds. This is not the same as the output volume. That's what I mean.

[16:58:35] <sgon2> randall: The system has sound. The speaker shows 90% volume. I don't know what else to check. I execute `kdialog` command in konsole terminal.
[16:59:12] <deadrom> sgon2, maybe #plamsa can help?
[16:59:21] <Sensiva> however it shows up in bwm-ng, but no read/writes are measured.

[17:32:00] <PerfDave> Might be worth looking at pipenv / venv though, that's a more Python-native way of doing it. I *think* you can build and specify versions of Python itself as well as libraries, but I haven't tried it.

[23:01:33] <dpkg> Packages currently on <hold> can be listed with «dpkg --get-selections | grep 'hold$'» (on hold for apt-get), or «aptitude search ~ahold» (on hold for aptitude).  See also <unhold>.
[23:01:43] <greycat> Bah.  Silly bot.
[23:02:07] <greycat> !held back
[23:02:07] <dpkg> Apt says packages are "kept back" when they cannot be upgraded even though  newer versions are available.  This happens if dependencies cannot be resolved, packages are on hold or you used "upgrade" not "full-upgrade" and old packages need to be removed as part of the upgrade.  To investigate, "aptitude -s install <kept-package>".  See also http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/69 and ask me about <full-upgrade>.
[23:02:48] <greycat> though in this case, we can't rule out either one.  also pins.  some people try to use pins.  it never ends well.
[23:03:27] <jmcnaught> And if you updated sources.list last night for some reason, then tried to install a package this morning, it is possible that apt has updated itself on its own.
[23:03:43] <johnfg> greycat: No pins from me, ever!  Since I'm still on buster, I ran 'apt full-upgrade' but nothing was done.
[23:04:09] <jmcnaught> !bat
[23:04:09] <dpkg> [Basic Apt* Troubleshooting]. To diagnose your problem, we need ALL OF THE FOLLOWING information: 1. complete output of your apt-get/apt/aptitude run (including the command used) 2. output from "apt-cache policy pkg1 pkg2..." for ALL packages mentioned ANYWHERE in the problem, and 3. "apt-cache policy".  Use https://paste.debian.net/ to provide us with this information.  Also ask me about <localized errors>.
[23:05:26] <johnfg> jmcnaught: Nope, nothing was run with the new bullseye sources.list.  Then, I reverted to buster sources.list, and ran apt update, then apt upgrade (installed 18 updates, btw).

[23:21:55] <johnfg> To get a working openafs-client before the upgrade to bullseye?
[23:22:28] <jmcnaught> johnfg: do you need it before the upgrade?  It would probably help if you provided the information requested by dpkg in the "!bat" factoid.
