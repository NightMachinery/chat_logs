[01:30:27] <somiaj> yes, but many things are based on debian

[08:44:54] <miroesq> So if I image this new backup, it iwll only take up less than 3gb?
[08:45:17] <PMT> If you use e2image to do it again, sure. Otherwise it depends on how sparse-aware the thing you use to do the copy is.
[08:45:46] <miroesq> Goit it. So it created a backup, but it only read the "used" bloacks.
[08:45:55] <PMT> And importantly, only wrote them, too.
[08:46:33] <PMT> But if you want to restore the image to something, it'll either need to be at least the size of that partition, or you'd need to use resize2fs to shrink it down.

[09:24:58] <miroesq> I was finally able to craete the image file. It is automatically saved in the root directory of my OS; I am logged in as root. Problem is that the file still lists itself as +7gb. I removed th SD card and actually copied the file to my windows computer and it copied as +7gb. I know this can't be true because the entire SD card is just under 8gb and the OS takes up 2.5gb  by itself. So even though I know the image file is smaller than 7gb,
[09:24:58] <miroesq>  it is showing +7gb.
[09:31:46] <SystemError> miroesq> guess one who gave you advice told how to create "sparse file". They are logical allocations that looks big but not take this space.
[09:32:06] <SystemError> though it only works if underlying fileystem supports "holes"
[09:32:14] <alkisg> miroesq: from what I read in the man page, -r says "generate a raw file" i.e. with the same size as the sd card, but "sparse", while -a says "put the file data inside too"
[09:32:38] <alkisg> So you essentially did the same as "dd" + "zerofill the non-data blocks" + "sparsing"

[09:58:39] <PMT> That's also not what you wrote. You said it as though it was two distinct steps.

[13:17:47] <kylese> n4dir, Khepra Thank you for the hints. Without modifying '/etc/manpath.config' or '~/.manpath', the directories '~/man/' and (like suggested) '~/bin/man/' seem to be recognized by default, but '~/.local/man/' and '~/.local/share/man/' have not. Therefore, a call 'man YXZ' does work for a file '~/man/XYZ.1.gz'. Unfortunately the auto-complete does not work yet, cp. to system-wide man pages. For instance, to call '~/man/ABCDEFG.1.gz' I would
[13:17:48] <kylese> have to write 'man ABCDEFG' manually. Trying some configs in '.manpath' didn't work for me. But, the answer to my question I have now. Again, thank you.

[17:05:45] <somiaj> It is a combination of techincal reasons (solutions in Debian may or may not work in derivatives, also we will sometimes give people a Debian answer and it doesn't work, then after hours of trying to figure out why, it is because they are on the derivative) and social reasons, we are volunteers who have chosen to support Debian pure blends. Derivatives have their own support communities.
[17:06:41] <somiaj> Similar with bug reports, you would need to be able to reproduce the bug in Debian to report it to Debian's BTS. One thing you get with the distro you choose is the support community.

[17:29:46] <Khepra> actually... to be precise, the setup script did    export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive at the beginning, thus not set on the same cmdline
[17:30:09] <Khepra> should be the same thing, but... also I use /bin/sh and not bash
[17:30:41] <Khepra> and I'm using apt-get, not apt, in scripts
[17:31:32] <dadinn> i'm actually using apt-mirror too, but it has been synced recently
[17:31:55] <Khepra> okay, did a test on bullseye staging VM, it works for me

[17:34:47] <Khepra> but yeah, it's still more produent to use apt-get in script
[17:37:07] <tomreyn> supposedly it's not warning about scripted use in the noninteractive scenario because it's even more likely there that the exact output format matters, because someone already made the mistake of scripting it.

[18:09:16] <Khepra> then it's probably not the config
[18:09:27] <fatal> i thought so too
[18:09:59] <Khepra> some applications are simply misbehaving under i3 for whatever reason. i've had trouble with PyCharm for long time until they fixed the bugs
[18:10:18] <fatal> maybe i should check out recent updates
[18:10:22] <Khepra> INCREDIBLY I'm not the only one using PyCharm under i3, and there were bug reports and workarounds. how bow dah.

[18:11:48] <Khepra> steam is another unruly brat misbehaving under i3.  but not under sway and xwayland, THAT seems to whip the snapper into submission
[18:13:24] <fatal> i didn't figure out how to run sway with wayland yet but i'm working on it
[18:13:56] <Khepra> "just do it". sway is wayland (only) compositor, there's nothing special to it. EXCEPT it has to be run from the console, ie no DMs

[18:15:18] <kveroneau> Does anybody switch WM based on how much more utility it could give your current task?  For example, I mainly use KDE Plasma as my daily driver, but when I need to do various things on multiple servers, and need to see everything easily with no WM fuss, I tend to login using awesome with a full tiled experience of xterms.
[18:15:34] <Khepra> wayland is a protocol, so other than various libwayland things pulled in as deps, there's nothing to start or configure, like there is with xorg

[18:23:00] <fatal> so the idea came to me when i read that xorg gets `one last` update and that wayland should something like next generation.
[18:24:10] <Khepra> fatal: it's mostly the same devs, who started wayland spec and reference compositor, as the next gen rendering platform on linux, yes, primarily due to xorg's bad and insecure design.
[18:24:17] <fatal> Khepra: i seldom have crashes with firefox, but everything else works as it should like terminal emulator, zathura, ranger etc.
[18:24:36] <Khepra> the latest updates to xorg did suprise me too. "I thought y'all said...."  and someone even updated Xeyes. Xeyes!! What the...
[18:25:28] <fatal> there are like three parts to the compositor as far as i undersand right?
[18:25:40] <Khepra> fatal: it's not firefox that crashes for me, it's xorg. was xorg, until I switched to sway(land). amdgpu module would do something illegal
[18:26:51] <fatal> i had a problem with X tho. so i go to tty6, login, startx. and when i go to tt5 login, and exit my Xserver crashes. doesn't matter if stable or not.

[22:01:58] <blluis> Hi everybody, some days ago I moved to debian 11 (fresh install) and today want to upgrade to gnome 40, I have 3.38.5, I've added experimental line to sources.list, update and sudo apt -t experimental install gnome.... but apt says that almost everyting is up to date (3.38) and will install only gnome-applets, some gnome-flashbacks, panel, its ok?

[22:04:49] <somiaj> You will have to wait for debian 12
[22:05:05] <somiaj> gnome is too big of a collection of packages to easily backport, and so I have never seen it done
[22:05:14] <blluis> puffffff, I knew it, hehehee.
[22:06:07] <blluis> leghorm: I use kdeconnect to move files and to know about im/telegram....
[22:06:38] <somiaj> You could run the development version of debian (which many do, but brings in its own set of problems). I personally say stick with stable, and enjoy a rock solid system for 2 years, then get a whole bunch of new shiny things with the release of 12 (though I sometimes upgrade to testing during the freeze)

[22:12:41] <somiaj> and there are ways around the limited security support
[22:14:11] <blluis> No problem, I just read a magazine article about gnome 40 and want to try, but I will do on a virtual machine and keep my debian clean.
