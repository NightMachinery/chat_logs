[02:58:05] <andrewrk> if you supply a libc file and it says "you didn't supply a libc file" that's a bug

[03:00:38] <andrewrk> I just double checked the code paths and it's not possible to get that message if ZIG_LIBC env var is provided
[03:01:04] <cCCCCcccccCCc> The build tool that calls zig exports it and if something tries to call 'cc' directly, it's a shell wrapper that exports ZIG_LIBC and then calls 'zig cc'. 
[03:01:17] <cCCCCcccccCCc> So I'm fairly positive it's covered. 
[03:01:25] <cCCCCcccccCCc> But yes, I guess I can dig deeper into that.
[03:01:45] <andrewrk> alright so both of us have eyeballed the code and don't see how this is happening. so the next step would be to dive deeper and debug where the unexpected thing is happening
[03:02:00] <cCCCCcccccCCc> Yeah, I'll do that, I believe you. 
[03:02:24] <andrewrk> but yeah supplying ZIG_LIBC is the intended solution to this problem
[03:03:16] <cCCCCcccccCCc> Thanks!

[06:22:37] <freshcoffee> hmm ok you can flip the switch in the linux ci script to do all that. The curent debian docker image will then simply not use image-embedded (extracted) tarballs
[06:24:03] <freshcoffee> sorry for splitting the ci/zinc/linux*.sh files up. I think it would be better to have 1 script, and use a switch statement. but never got around to consolodating it yet.
[06:24:28] <andrewrk> what switch to flip are you talking about?
[06:25:46] <freshcoffee> my misleading words sorry, meant conceptually. anyhow, ci/zinc/linux_build.sh would have to put back the `wget` and `tar xf` stuff that was removed.

[06:26:31] <andrewrk> am I supposed to do SETUP and then ZIG-BOOTSTRAP? or are those two competing things?
[06:28:22] <Rokkuman> andrewrk: So hey! I have a question for you. So in this stream of yours (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq1XqP4-qOo) you were showcasing Zig for the purposes of a portable binary that'd run across many Linux distros. I was wondering what colorscheme were you using on that vim setup of yours? (Seems like Ayu Dark?)
[06:28:38] <freshcoffee> because dockerfile doesn't let you do a local mount, from which to download, and extract the tarballs. but this is moot if not needed anymore, and I think dockerfile could then be used again.
[06:30:47] <freshcoffee> the SETUP is to create a single-purpose docker image to do a ci-run . But generically, I could be used as a basis to build ZIG-BOOTSTRAP.  I hope I understand your question properly.
[06:31:04] <freshcoffee> s/I/it could be used/
[06:33:08] <andrewrk> ok I think I understand, let me try following these directions
[06:33:29] <andrewrk> Rokkuman, it's https://github.com/haze/sitruuna.vim
[06:34:59] <andrewrk> freshcoffee, why does the image need i386 stuff?
[06:35:17] <freshcoffee> i386 is run during zig test suite natively

[06:35:31] <andrewrk> I see thanks

[06:39:39] <andrewrk> Rokkuman, nope, I don't really have any font preferences. I don't mess with my set up very often, you'd get better answers from asking probably anyone else from the entire internet than me
[06:40:17] <andrewrk> what yaml?

[09:09:56] <Rokkuman> freshcoffee: Personally liking how readable and fancy it is (Iosevka SS07 I mean). You also like narrow fonts? 
[09:10:37] <freshcoffee> I haven't tried programming with narrow in a very long time, but may try again soon.
[09:13:15] <Rokkuman> Good luck! For narrow fonts, I recommend, well, Iosevka once more and the Sudo font, the latter being a bit of an underrated one

[10:56:57] <andrewrk> no, I'm not sure what you're referencing
[10:57:43] <daurn> http://sprunge.us/2yuzFv 
[10:58:26] <daurn> That's trying to run `./zig build test` in a clean chroot (packaging new 0.9.1 release for archlinux)
[10:59:28] <freshcoffee> fyi I got the same fail. It's during test-stage2 in the 1/66 part where some N/800 or so sub tests are run.
[10:59:35] <daurn> yep
[10:59:36] <freshcoffee> (on archlinux). haven't tried on macos.
[11:00:41] <freshcoffee> also odd, my experience was if you run in interactive terminal, there's some extra detail emitted, but I couldn't really tell if it was related to the actual FAIL. running in batch (capturing to log file) didn't show the same output.

[11:40:25] <andrewrk> pretty sure I cherry picked a linker fix that included a test case that required other changes that didn't make the 0.9.x branch 
[11:42:49] <andrewrk> unrelated: I have a change to the CI for windows that removes the dependency on MSVC, and does not add a dependency on msys2, instead relying on zig 0.9.1 zip file that has llvm libs in it

[16:22:22] <jemius> I experience awkward behavior with the neovim-Plugin. When I add 0x to the color-code in line 34, then press ESC and then :w, the entire enum from lines 31 to 35 gets formatted into a one-liner.
[16:22:23] <jemius> https://pastebin.com/LtSsnSA5
[16:23:30] <jemius> Does Zig enforce a certain way of formatting?
[16:23:45] <plumeus> `zig fmt`?
[16:24:36] <jemius> plumeus, I don't call zig fmt. Andrew's plugin does that automatically when saving. https://github.com/ziglang/zig.vim
[16:25:08] <plumeus> Doesn't that use `zig fmt`?
[16:25:37] <plumeus> >This plugin enables automatic code formatting on save by default using zig fmt.
[16:25:50] <luuk> When you add a trailer comma, 'zig fmt' will not format it to a one-liner.
[16:26:16] <jemius> luuk, that's what I am surprised about. Because it never formatted anything previously
[16:27:51] <luuk> I have no experience with NeoVim, but the zig fmt behavior hasn't changed with that regard
[16:27:54] <plumeus> https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-make-zig-fmt-skip-a-range-of-source-lines if you want to explicitly turn off bits.
[16:27:58] *** Joins: arkurious (~arkurious@user/arkurious)
[16:28:04] <plumeus> also, `0000ff` isn't a valid number, right?
[16:28:25] <plumeus> I don't think `zig fmt` works if there's some syntax errors.
[16:29:06] <plumeus> everyone becomes one line for me if it's changed to `0x0000ff`.
[16:29:35] <luuk> Correct, it essentially parses the source code into an AST, and then formats it into the conanical form based on that. So if any errors were found during parsing, it will emit those, rather than format the source.
[16:32:17] <plumeus> oh wait, I totally misunderstood what was being said, my bad.
[16:32:32] <plumeus> I use Neovim too, and I can confirm that behavior hasn't changed.
[16:32:54] <jemius> It seems to me zig fmt doesn't break a very long enum into lines if it does not end with ','
[16:33:08] <plumeus> That's intentional
[16:33:08] <luuk> Correct
[16:33:20] <luuk> zig fmt has no opinions about line length
[16:33:42] <plumeus> If you have a trailing comma, it breaks the list by the smallest number of individual arguments
[16:33:59] <plumeus> so, if you have a trailing comma and each line has two items, it'll make a nice row of 2 items
[16:34:42] <jemius> So there is some sort of formatting standard built into the language itself, but not as strict as in Go, right? Is there a list of things what `fmt` does?
[16:35:11] <plumeus> It's as strict as Go.
[16:35:37] <jemius> cool
[16:35:59] <plumeus> There are no formatting options, and the only control you really have over it is that you can turn it off explicitly
[16:37:23] <plumeus> Not aware of any place that has all the formatting behavior listed.
[16:38:10] <jemius> So it seems it doesn't even allow me to have 2 empty lines between functions
[16:38:16] <jemius> no me gusta
[16:38:51] <jemius> But I can have lines which are 400 chars wide
[16:39:42] <plumeus> Enforcing line width would probably not be the easiest task.

[17:12:59] <ifreund> Hmm, how do I use a Vector(8, u32) as the rhs of a <<?
[17:13:18] <ifreund> I can't bitcast it to a Vector(8, u5) as that has a different size
[17:13:53] <ifreund> but I know for a fact that the u32s I want to shift by are in the range 0 to 2^5 - 1
[17:14:01] <ifreund> Am I missing something or is this a design flaw
[17:17:40] <plumeus> If you know they are within u5, can you not just make them as a Vector(8, u5) in the first place? Or iterate over the vector?
[17:19:56] <ifreund> no, because the Vector(8, u32) is the result of a previous >> operation
[17:21:05] <ifreund> iterating over the vector would kinda kill the poind of using SIMD in the first place
[17:22:46] <plumeus> hmm, so maybe there should be some operator that functions as a bitshift left, but doesn't have type checking?
[17:25:29] <ifreund> I don't know what the right fix is here. Another possibility would be to add the ability to have padding between the lanes in vector types
[17:26:24] <ifreund> which could then allow casting between Vector(8, u32) and a hypothetical Vector(8, u5) with 32 bit lanes

[23:36:37] <andrewrk> jemius, the only thing I did in that vim plugin was the original syntax file, which isn't even used anymore. I'm barely even a maintainer of that repo
[23:36:49] <andrewrk> I'm definitely a user though
[23:53:31] <andrewrk> ifreund, how's the generated code for the intcast u5 on the vector?

[23:53:50] <andrewrk> motiejus, I'll remember that :) I imagine I will do it someday
[23:54:38] <andrewrk> a comptime perfect hashing API could be quite sophisticated
[23:54:59] <andrewrk> it could be target aware, favoring instructions it knows are available and cheap for a given target
[23:56:39] <andrewrk> it would be cheeky and fun to try using a genetic algorithm to figure out the set of instructions to produce the hash
[23:57:40] <andrewrk> you could also set up a test harness that ran the results across a variety of hash functions on real hardware to try to verify or produce the target-aware cost weights
[23:57:52] <andrewrk> it's such a nerd snipe :)
