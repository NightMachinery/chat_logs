[01:45:08] <hoppity> thanks, yes I will keep it safe but I am curious, is this a BAD practice or what is the correct/BEST way to do this. My api has literally one client only and will never have more.
[01:45:39] <zircona> hoppity: also make sure that you use https/tls
[01:45:52] <hoppity> zircona: absolutely
[01:46:21] <hoppity> I am using a .app tld so it literally cannot work without https/tls :)
[01:46:48] <zircona> hoppity: I'm trying to build a similar app where a UUID will be automatically created for new users
[01:47:15] <zircona> and used as a login/password combo (aka secret url)
[01:47:38] <hoppity> I would just pass the current date/time + username through a hashing algorithm
[01:47:58] <zircona> that should work too

[01:48:58] <hoppity> The reason why I am asking my question is that, though the solution seems fine enough, I prefer to run it bo other people to make sure I am not missing something.

[01:49:43] <hoppity> Usually these DIY security mechanisms are actually not secure
[01:49:53] <zircona> I'm not anywhere near a professional programmer but my app isn't vital so not a huge deal if a problem happens
[01:49:53] <hoppity> or at least that's what I've heard

[01:50:28] <zircona> yes
[01:51:26] <zircona> yeah DIY security isn't usually a good idea, but an HTTPS url is encrypted using non-diy tech so I think that it is ok (as long as the government is not your adversary)
[01:53:00] <zircona> but either way hopefully someone that knows more will also chyme in

[02:34:54] <PaulWay[w]> If something links to it, Google will find it.
[02:35:10] <PaulWay[w]> If you browse to it in Chrome, Google has found it.
[02:35:30] <DanTheAutomator> I think it is generally safe if behind HTTPS, you remember not to visit the url from a public computer, nothing links to it, and it's not securing PII. I actually do this in a side project of mine. They are 40+ character strings unique to each user. Saved me from writing password reset pages.
[02:36:34] <PaulWay[w]> Yep.
[02:37:21] <PaulWay[w]> So the question you have to ask from the above is: are you securing something that people will try using a search engine to find?
[02:38:41] <DanTheAutomator> I'm not sure I agree with Chrome/Google adding the link to search just browsing to it. That would break their own secure links to Google docs potentially, wouldn't it.
[02:42:40] <hoppity> PaulWay[w]: good point regarding google

[03:57:42] <zircona> in my template, how should I do this: {% url uuid + 'notes:create' %}  ? I'm try to redirect to this url path('<uuid:uuid>/create/', views.CreateView.as_view(), name='create'),

[04:06:56] <DanTheAutomator> well it's also in the url, that's what your <uuid:uuid> in your url path is, no?

[13:50:54] <serafeim> Bubblegum5000: this is strange for me. why would django create like-like indeces by default ?
[13:52:53] <Bubblegum5000> Yeah that's a good question (thanks for your reply). The indices are 50GB+ large and I feel like I do not need them. Example of a field which got a big index: `outpoint =      models.CharField( max_length = 72, unique = True, primary_key = True)`
[13:54:02] <Bubblegum5000> I understand the ORM might feel like CharFields always need indices for quick text lookup using LIKE queries. The resulting index is called `bitcoind_txout_outpoint_3b9116d3_like`.
[13:54:24] <serafeim> this is a primary key
[13:54:56] <serafeim> and also has a unique constraint. so the index will be added anyway
[13:57:17] <Bubblegum5000> Yeah I see. I just thought the `_pkey` index was used for the primary key. Now there are two: https://dpaste.org/CPJC/slim
[13:57:58] <Bubblegum5000> I feel like the 2nd btree index (bitcoind_txout_outpoint_3b9116d3_like) at the top is unnecessary
[13:59:15] <serafeim> yes that seems so... you could try dropping it and see what happens
[14:03:52] <Bubblegum5000> 🚀 no guts no glory. Dropped them, let's see what happens. At least I have 300GB of space back.
[14:06:59] <serafeim> worst case something is very slow and you'll need to re-create them
[14:07:05] <serafeim> that would take a lot of time though ...
[14:08:56] <Bubblegum5000> Thanks for your help serafeim! We will see!
[14:09:04] <serafeim> no problem
[14:12:14] <schinckel> Bubblegum5000: Is your PK a text field?
[14:12:28] <Bubblegum5000> Yes schinckel. CharField.
[14:12:59] <schinckel> If you need to do any `pk__like='x'` queries they are going to suck now.

[15:23:57] <bancroft> are there any popular alternatives to celery?
[15:27:50] <b-rex> bancroft: https://python-rq.org/
[15:32:54] <bancroft> b-rex: let's say I had django in a docker container, and rq in another, can I just install the functions dependencies in the rq container or do they need to be in both?
[15:33:19] <bancroft> for this queue.enqueue to work
[15:33:34] <bancroft> hmm actually I guess not. It would have to be installed in both
[15:36:24] <b-rex> bancroft: why not just use the same container image?
[15:36:54] <b-rex> bancroft: one runs the rq worker, the other runs whatever (e.g. gunicorn) for the django
[15:38:04] <bancroft> b-rex: becaues the docker image is huge and I can only have so many workers due to space
[15:38:34] <bancroft> I want the workers to only need to install whatever they need for the specific queue they're in
[15:38:36] <b-rex> they all use the same container image though
[15:38:59] <b-rex> and likely the same volumes, if you need them
[15:39:55] <b-rex> https://dpaste.org/eCNX
[15:40:21] <b-rex> ^ something i do for celery.
[15:41:00] <bancroft> b-rex: I only have 500GB available, you're telling me I can deploy more than 25 containers where the image is 19.89GB (rounded up to 20) as long as I have the cpu/mem?
[15:42:03] <b-rex> you'll have 1 container image that is 20GB and 2-3 containers that use that image. so i imagine the total used space would be 20GB or slightly more. not 40-60GB

[15:47:34] <bancroft> dodo: I can't, 3rd party research don't want to update or are dragging their feet
[15:47:55] <dodo> bancroft: i have no idea what that means
[15:48:12] <dodo> carloratm: you'll likely want an html parser for that..
[15:48:47] <bancroft> dodo: if I keep everything in the image it's going to grow to over 50GB my the end of the month. I can't keep doing this, I need a way to have only certain deps installed in certain containers
[15:49:00] <dodo> carloratm: and by introducing such tests you'll also make it harder to update templates, just saying
[15:49:27] <dodo> bancroft: erm, so just do that?
[15:49:54] <dodo> bancroft: if your goal is to reduce disk usage, having one fat image might be the most efficient though
[15:50:35] <bancroft> dodo: maybe in the end, but local dev will be a nightmare when they have all this stuff the don't need
[15:50:36] <dodo> how on earth are you going to find 30G of python deps anyway?
[15:51:26] <bancroft> dodo: java, jython, it's a lot of different versions of the same libraries too
[15:51:42] <dodo> bancroft: so what is your goal, actually?
[15:51:53] <dodo> bancroft: give developers the smallest possible images?

[22:01:09] <daniel2> If someone can maybe point me to the right direction on this.  I was curious on how I could map domains to a specific view, where I would maybe map the domain a variable which would search for that domain, pass the variable to the view and bring up the page.  Kind of like how sites like wix.com lets you use your own domain.

[22:17:36] <avdempsey> Is it possible to express a self join with the ORM that is equivalent to this: https://dpaste.org/ttes

[22:28:28] <avdempsey> I feel like I got halfway there with this (https://dpaste.org/s3HW), seems like that would get the value I was looking for if it could be extended to self-join.
[22:29:22] <avdempsey> objects.raw with a SQL query works fine, but curious if there's something I missed in the ORM

[23:43:55] <stdout> what's a good way to handle users double or triple clicking a submit button? let's say you have a simple form that sends an e-mail, i've found that users don't know that single clicking things is possible, so how would you keep from sending two e-mails when the submit button is double-clicked before the page is redirected?
