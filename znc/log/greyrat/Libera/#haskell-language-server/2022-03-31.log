[18:27:13] <wz1000> pepeiborra: can we fake cycle detection using the cycle detection in hls-graph and delete the code in ghcide?

[20:33:18] <pepeiborra> wz1000: I don't think so, the error messages would be crap and would not even reference the module cycle

[20:36:06] <pepeiborra> even if you tried to massage the hls-graph into a friendly error message, there's also the potential for 2 concurrent mutually dependent builds deadlocking. 
[20:36:26] <pepeiborra> (massage the hls-graph stack)
