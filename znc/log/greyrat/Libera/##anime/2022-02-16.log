[03:07:08] <ButterNoodle> and thats a high gain powered antenna
[03:07:22] <Sapphirus> I'm able to maintain a lock indoors with my GPS module.
[03:07:25] <ButterNoodle> and that one does loose its data after power loss
[03:07:38] <ButterNoodle> afaik

[03:09:55] <Sapphirus> Pi Hats are technically serial.
[03:10:15] <Sapphirus> There's a ublox pi hat I've been wanting to get, but rpi shortages...

[03:17:21] <Sapphirus> Pi Hat has an coaxial antenna connector and you can just run the antenna whereever.
[03:18:38] <Sapphirus> Then hook a poe hat onto it from a poe switch and you can locate it close enough to reach the antenna near a window or something.

[06:39:20] <jessedesu2> Nope
[06:39:25] <Fenderbassist> what about applying elsewhere?
[06:39:51] <Fenderbassist> if you're "done" with this place, just keep doing your best while looking for the next job
[06:39:52] <jessedesu2> This one feeds me everything I need
[06:40:09] <jessedesu2> It's a Lil complicated
[06:40:20] <Fenderbassist> if you can make it work for now, that would be easier
[06:40:34] <jessedesu2> But yeah mail does not interest me
[06:41:40] <Fenderbassist> sometimes you do something just because it does meet your needs financially
[06:41:55] <jessedesu2> It does but
[06:42:05] <jessedesu2> Not happy anymore
[06:42:32] <jessedesu2> I need my medical tho
[06:42:45] <Fenderbassist> if you could push a shiny red magic button that would change your work situation to whatever you want, what would that end up being?
[06:42:45] <jessedesu2> It's a good system
[06:43:14] <jessedesu2> I'd be painting

[06:46:02] <jessedesu2> It's a good skill I have
[06:46:20] <Fenderbassist> it sure beats digging ditches by a thousand miles
[06:46:22] <jessedesu2> I could use it to manage my own business
[06:46:45] <Fenderbassist> certainly
[06:46:56] <jessedesu2> My dad is helping me find a new therapist
[06:47:06] <Fenderbassist> cool

[06:47:23] <Fenderbassist> how's your diet lately?
[06:47:27] <jessedesu2> Poor

[06:47:55] <jessedesu2> I have knee injury
[06:48:02] <Fenderbassist> yeah let that heal
[06:48:17] <Fenderbassist> I was just thinking, some good quality proteins might make you feel a little better and should help with healing
[06:48:27] <jessedesu2> It's been 12 years already

[06:52:37] <jessedesu2> And they're getting complicated
[06:52:46] <jessedesu2> Exactly
[06:53:04] <Fenderbassist> if you can hold that motivation, then things should work out
[06:53:18] <Fenderbassist> when I need extra motivation, I get espresso :)
[06:53:22] <jessedesu2> It pays my hobbies

[08:25:28] <MootPoot> slips_: shit
[08:25:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Also that's a C++ framework

[08:26:00] <MootPoot> or maybe C just is shorthand in this case

[08:36:25] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: the IDE itself works but it has something to do with the connection to the arduino and how rosetta works 
[08:36:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> That just means you'll have to install x86-64 software on your M1.
[08:36:40] <amigojapan> MootPoot: Apple claimed programs would be compatible
[08:36:43] <MootPoot> so you can write code, it just cant connect to the board
[08:36:49] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Keep them in a subpath or somethign and set the IDE to call it.
[08:37:04] <Aurora_v_kosmose> With binfmt setup it should automagically emulate properly.

[08:42:42] <MootPoot> oh, I got it to compile
[08:43:11] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Indeed, Linux is generally more capable than windows outside of what is explicitly supported for customers and even then... it usually isn't far and is sometimes better.

[08:56:42] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So fairly recent.
[08:56:42] <MootPoot> huh
[08:57:14] <MootPoot> I never know what "recent" or "modern" mean coming from linux people
[08:57:24] <MootPoot> amigo thinks a decade old is still recent
[08:57:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In this case it means literally the latest release.

[09:03:22] <MootPoot> if that counts
[09:03:50] <MootPoot> I should apply for more jobs
[09:05:39] <MootPoot> or maybe I should write more C# code
[09:05:39] <MootPoot> idk
[09:05:49] <MootPoot> C# is stonk
[09:05:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> More Lisp
[09:06:08] <MootPoot> I dont have a ultra rare lispy thingy 
[09:06:20] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You don't need that.
[09:06:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ECL & SBCL can generate native blobs.
[09:07:22] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Fun fact: Non-compressed SBCL can use less memory than compressed. Because the system doesn't need to map & read all of it into memory at once to decompress the program before executing.
[09:07:37] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So it may be mapped but never used during runtime if you just use uncompressed images.
[09:07:51] <MootPoot> everything is a blob
[09:08:05] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So compression only makes sense if you intend to save disk space at the expense of everything else.
[09:08:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Or basically, saving the least important thing.
[09:08:50] <MootPoot> its really hard to find a use for my extra SBC now that I have that exsi box
[09:09:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> You could use it for an actual automation kind of job.
[09:10:09] <MootPoot> there's not much I really want automated, only thing I wanted was maybe my room lights but hue bulbs took care of that 
[09:10:29] <MootPoot> I guess automated window opening/closing but that would require potential house damage

[09:44:14] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Electrical safety concerns, both for the server and for myself, are why I do it.
[09:44:39] <ButterNoodle> woah a light in the toilet? for better targeting?
[09:44:48] <ButterNoodle> I dont open them Aurora_v_kosmose..
[09:44:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> With a scope.
[09:45:14] <ButterNoodle> just blow out the front
[09:45:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Well I don't open the HDDs. But the server gets its fan shields & everything removed.
[09:45:21] <MootPoot> amigojapan: what if it's just error checking or refreshing your data
[09:45:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Is it shield? The air-path shaping stuff.
[09:45:35] <ButterNoodle> yep
[09:45:59] <ButterNoodle> I think I have done that 2x in 4 years
[09:46:09] <ButterNoodle> only because I put in new 10gig cards
[09:46:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Sadly I can't operate my equipment in a very clean environment. If I could afford the space & cost of a proper rack I could most likely get away with not doing that anymore by filtering at the rack instead.
[09:46:57] <ButterNoodle> when they sound like they are struggling for air, I just blow out the fronts
[09:47:17] <ButterNoodle> mine are open racks :|
[09:47:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It rarely operates >30C, so I'm not particularly concerned with its temps.
[09:47:26] <ButterNoodle> cat hair is my only issue
[09:48:15] <Sapphirus> the filters on my case stop cat hair infiltration, thankfully

[09:50:03] <MootPoot> So
[09:50:06] <MootPoot> Eh
[09:50:06] <Sapphirus> but there's like a noctua fan pointing directly over teh cage

[09:57:30] <Sapphirus> yes
[09:57:40] <ButterNoodle> I have those in my PC
[09:57:43] <Sapphirus> not for OEM servers
[09:57:51] <ButterNoodle> not in my servers
[09:57:53] <Sapphirus> yeah, those are what I put in mine.
[09:58:23] <ButterNoodle> I did fan swaps on my UPSs with noctua's.. since they put some kinda industrial fan in there
[09:58:28] <Sapphirus> probably could find noctua fans foryour server
[09:58:40] <MootPoot> Weeb sex
[09:58:47] <ButterNoodle> yea they work fine
[09:58:59] <ButterNoodle> I'd only put forth the effort to quiet something down
[09:59:03] <Sapphirus> i spent like $300 canuckistani dollars on these fans
[09:59:21] <ButterNoodle> I think I have 6 of those in my game box
[09:59:49] <Sapphirus> i put in 7 (3 intake, 3 exhaust, and 1 rear exhaust)
[10:00:17] <Sapphirus> rear exhaust I control with pwm alongside the nh-d15 fans
[10:00:30] <Sapphirus> since it's pretty much a 3rd cpu fan in practice
[10:01:29] <Sapphirus> What sold me on them more than anything was the dust protection. Having pets is a death sentence to cheap fans
[10:01:38] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: what do you do with all those servers 
[10:01:42] <MootPoot> I need ideas

[10:06:12] <ButterNoodle> yea sonarr

[10:06:24] <ButterNoodle> yep
[10:06:27] <ButterNoodle> even in aur
[10:06:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I see no reason it shouldn't build.
[10:06:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It has a build.sh
[10:06:31] <Sapphirus> nice
[10:06:40] <Sapphirus> I should setup another vm for this
[10:06:49] <ButterNoodle> yes
[10:07:00] <ButterNoodle> this is how we get to 60 VMs running on a box..

[10:08:21] <Sapphirus> and well, it's better.
[10:08:32] <ButterNoodle> transmission is pretty dry.. not good features like proxy support and block lists that work
[10:08:45] <ButterNoodle> have a nice walk amigojapan
[10:08:51] <Sapphirus> block lists are bleh just use a vpn
[10:09:01] <ButterNoodle> :|
[10:09:04] <ButterNoodle> u dont use both?
[10:09:06] <Sapphirus> Maintaining block lists is tiring
[10:09:07] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: going by bus, am late
[10:09:12] <Sapphirus> why use both
[10:09:12] <ButterNoodle> ic amigojapan
[10:09:32] <ButterNoodle> why not? isnt more privacy better?
[10:09:36] <Sapphirus> it's not like they're going to dmca a vpn ip
[10:09:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: Blocklists should be at the firewall anyway.
[10:09:59] <Sapphirus> ^ which is where I had mine previously
[10:10:08] <Sapphirus> and it became masochistic to maintain
[10:10:17] <ButterNoodle> just a simple bash script
[10:10:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Proxy is mildly unfortunate but you could and should use VPN + default route interface
[10:10:37] <ButterNoodle> and when using socks it works fine
[10:10:39] <ButterNoodle> yea that too
[10:10:45] <ButterNoodle> leakage is a problem
[10:10:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> There's a way to do with wireguard so it takes all default traffic and if it dies it doesn't leak shit.
[10:10:50] <ButterNoodle> iptables that user
[10:11:03] <Sapphirus> leakage isn't a problem when you cover your entire network with one
[10:11:33] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Basically, you setup a route for the specific wireguard server you're reaching, and you put 0.0.0.0/0, ::0/0 as allowed IPs for the server.
[10:11:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It'll automagically rewrite & tag/flag your routing table.
[10:11:55] <ButterNoodle> *dont trust it
[10:12:12] <Sapphirus> I just cover my entire network with policy-based routing
[10:12:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: It works fairly well.
[10:12:23] <ButterNoodle> *dont trust it
[10:12:27] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: fuck off
[10:12:37] <ButterNoodle> eat a dick dude
[10:12:37] <Sapphirus> To be fair, I agree with him.
[10:12:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But I also didn't give a default gateway to the machine outside of that.
[10:12:44] <ButterNoodle> rly
[10:12:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So it cannot route without the VPN.
[10:12:57] <Sapphirus> like a firewall should be external, so should your vpn 
[10:13:05] <ButterNoodle> network engineer long enough to know better...
[10:13:06] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I have some papers I need to give them. And I was doing to send it by snail mail, that is why I bought the stamp. But they said today is the time limit, so I am going in person
[10:13:06] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Updates are fetched from a local proxy/cache.
[10:13:37] <Sapphirus> ButterNoodle, I got the right idea, don't I? VPN setup externally to the machine and all.
[10:13:38] <ButterNoodle> enjoy ur leaky c-section wound on ur ip stack

[10:15:03] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Why would you do it at any greater a granularity than per-VM?
[10:15:17] <Aurora_v_kosmose> s/greater/lower/
[10:15:39] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Some need VPN, some don't. So those that don't do not get it.

[10:17:26] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: Aurora_v_kosmose what do you think of a full screen launcher that lists all programs in the repo, then your can just click why program and if it is not installed it just goes ahead and installs it and then runs it?
[10:17:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> If yes, remove your neighbors
[10:17:44] <Sapphirus> amigojapan, that sounds like a security hazard.
[10:17:51] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ^
[10:18:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> But mostly it sounds like it'd get in the way if you fuzzy match on typos.
[10:18:05] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: I put it on a dedicated 5ghz band where only the headset is on there

[10:18:36] <MootPoot> But that 1% lag spike fucks me
[10:19:30] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: what if it does not list every program but at least every program that would not be a security problem?
[10:19:59] <Sapphirus> how would you suppose that would be done?
[10:20:05] <MootPoot> Aurora_v_kosmose: I see wavemon is both a package and a physical device 
[10:20:32] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: That's hard to determine.
[10:20:43] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: compile a list of them?
[10:21:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> amigojapan: I think it could do like that one program Ubuntu had some point that asked if you want to install some matches for your query, but in no way should it just transparently do so.

[10:58:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I kinda wish government would realize that arrow/bolt guns are simple to make and can be made from scratch on the cheap & quiet.
[10:59:03] <MootPoot> Why do you want them to realize that?

[10:59:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: The whole legal aspect is just security theatre and a waste of time & money.
[10:59:27] <MootPoot> Yeah, but then you'll get even more annoying hurdles 
[10:59:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They should stop annoying those of us who are willing to legally buy whatever instead of just doing it anyway.
[11:00:00] <MootPoot> "show id to buy bowstring" 
[11:00:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Arrow guns use gas pressure or springs usually.
[11:01:08] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Also, just buy a whole calf or some shit and get sinews for bowstrings.
[11:01:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Though you can probably make something with more conventional synthetic fibers.
[11:01:44] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Such as fiber glass.
[11:02:07] <MootPoot> Lazy 
[11:02:20] <jessedesu_onaph> Please don't say lazy

[11:04:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Airsoft works for dry-firing practice.

[13:27:09] <Sapphirus> I've got cl14 2400mhz in this system

[18:28:41] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: yea it seems that cisco is the only one consistent tho.. consistently proprietary, but working
[18:28:52] <Bco1981> lol yes
[18:29:00] <ButterNoodle> I hate it
[18:29:22] <ButterNoodle> brocade switch lost its mind
[18:29:36] <Bco1981> yeah, i have heard that before.
[18:29:51] <ButterNoodle> I have a port that turns up on the 1st and 15th for a big backup job.. this time, it didnt come up
[18:29:57] <analoq> Sadale: :3
[18:30:03] <analoq> i need your chinese skills
[18:30:04] <Bco1981> my previous work place loved them... funny enough they had a loop atleast once a month.
[18:30:12] <Sadale> analoq, shoot
[18:30:13] <ButterNoodle> tldr, I turned off spanning tree on that port and it worked
[18:30:43] <ButterNoodle> they are cheap.. they are nice.. but the rule of 3s
[18:30:58] <ButterNoodle> u cant have cheap, nice, and functional
[18:31:03] <Bco1981> max 3 in a string ?
[18:31:08] <Bco1981> oh
[18:31:44] <ButterNoodle> the same reason a woman has 3 holes.. only 2 self lubricate
[18:31:48] <ButterNoodle> but
[18:32:12] <ButterNoodle> for a <$100 switch off of the used market.. I'm not gonna complain as long as I can work around the issues
[18:33:50] <JesseDesu> cum buckets
[18:33:50] <Bco1981> they can't do tracking ? or are they connected to a cisco that can do track, then make an opposit. track one interface if up, then shut. then you don't need stp to do it for you since only 1 link will be up at a time.
[18:34:31] <ButterNoodle> naa switch just needs a reboot to clear out spanning tree
[18:34:37] <Bco1981> ah.
[18:34:38] <ButterNoodle> its a host port
[18:34:44] <Bco1981> oh
[18:34:47] <ButterNoodle> couldnt get any new host ports to come up
[18:34:51] <Bco1981> to esx host ?
[18:34:57] <Bco1981> ah
[18:35:13] <ButterNoodle> nope.. access port no trunk :|
[18:35:19] <Bco1981> weird
[18:35:27] <ButterNoodle> yea.. its a bug..
[18:35:40] <Bco1981> it's consistent... it's a feature
[18:35:42] <ButterNoodle> ofc they are not really supported anymore so gl
[18:36:01] <ButterNoodle> but doing actual spanning tree things broke it
[18:36:27] <ButterNoodle> I think somewhere in its little world it thinks there is still a spanning tree loop somewhere
[18:36:33] <Poeticode> Sadale yeah transactions are usually done in grams and not ounces lol
[18:36:39] <Sadale> ah. weird
[18:36:52] <ButterNoodle> back in my day.. we use oz for pot

[22:02:10] <Llamamoe> "Rust" makes me think of getting down to the nitty gritty of things
[22:02:22] <isekaijin> Poeticode: It is popular because it empowers webshits to write relatively safe low-level code.
