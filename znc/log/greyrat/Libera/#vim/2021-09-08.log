[03:18:23] <nova> vvdaiwrw, you remember correctly, but [1] gender identity ≠ romantic (or otherwise) attraction (eg, a trans woman could be a lesbian and date women), and [2] I am pan :D but also more "attracted" to men but mostly just attracted to beautiful, awesome people. When I was "dating" girls it was because I thought they were super awesome .. and beautiful, too (but I kind of wanted to be them, and I
[03:18:25] <nova> confused liking someone as a friend with being romantically attracted to them). Indeed, nothing ever happened because I just ... wasn't interested ... despite them being beautiful and awesome

[07:45:31] <node1> It's a world's best text editor. But how to integrate development features like debuger, current stack information, git hooks and others feature?
[07:45:46] <dre> node1,  I use tmux to debug; vim in one half, shell_plus in other. 
[07:45:55] <dre> I don't use debugger that much 
[07:46:18] <node1> okay.
[07:46:19] <dre> ipython debugging works fine, and the code is typed well 
[07:47:29] <nova> you could use pygdb with :help termdebug or another shell (or :terminal) with ipython. Also there is command-line git (or whatever git util you want to use) and tpope's fugitive plugin. Vim is not an operating system or a swiss army knife (well..). It's mostly a text editor
[07:49:37] <vvdaiwrw> there's vimspector or nvim-dap these days as well.
[07:49:59] <nova> phy1729, did you have any wisdom about such a system? maybe it would be easier to read or better to add a semi-colon after each refinement. That way you could also still have regex flags like in vim (for example /foo/+ to go to the next line or /foo/e to place cursor after (idk if that's useful in this context, though, esp since we could just chain another command))

[07:56:16] <nova> "fundamental ... unix [philosophy is] structured data" - what does that mean? I am thinking about some shell command like  taco | grep -i tasty | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f3  .. at each stage in pipeline, the command has no structure - only text.

[18:37:56] <wwilliam> oops sorry
[18:38:31] <bn_work> romainl:  under certain situations if one is 100% confident of the matches w/o seeing context, sure, but I didn't feel comfortable with that which is why I just wanted to do an interactive global search and replace with context (& syntax highlighting enabled to actually see things more easily)

[18:40:14] <bn_work> anyway, just went ahead and did it w/o syntax highlighting since it was taking too long, a bit disappointed vim doesn't support keeping syntax highlighting enabled when one does it interactively (which doesn't seem to be the case with :cdo either BTW)

[18:40:59] <bn_work> thanks for the help though, as that did ultimately work
