[01:27:46] <rwb> and at the very top you have the frontend which was written 2 years ago and will randomly crash every now and then
[01:28:07] <indigo> You forgot about the poor attempt at spinning the monolith out into microservices that all depend on each other

[03:06:09] <kline> what is it thats hard in front end?
[03:06:41] <kline> not that i dont believe it, but i always viewed it as "fiddly", rather than "hard", and a lot of the difficulty coming from subjective and psychological stuff outside of "hard" tech
[03:07:21] <technomancy> how is "fiddly" different from "hard for stupid reasons"?
[03:08:23] <kline> fiddly being annoying, tedious trial and error to get the right results, hard requiring a lot of thought and specific reasoning
[03:08:57] <kline> ive never found this to be the case when fixing an admittedly infuriating css issue, the same kind of feeling of battling a difficult "hard" backend bug, but the skills involved are different
[03:08:58] <technomancy> oh, well that's not what I mean by hard
[03:09:05] <technomancy> I just mean it takes a lot of effort
[03:09:47] <manicennui> Yeah, I don't work on things that are actually hard.
[03:09:51] <kline> i think the easy/hard spectrum of the article isnt about just how much effort something takes
[03:10:00] <manicennui> But I try to avoid frontend development, which is a pain in the ass.
[03:10:09] <manicennui> And the frontend ecosystems tend to suck.
[03:10:38] <kline> the term we have for this at work is "mandraulic"
[03:10:51] <mgdm> I know a little bit of React, enough to be dangerous with, but my old team with a NextJS/React/MobX thing took it far further than I could ever be bothered to understand (which was fine, I was in an architecture role)
[03:11:09] <mgdm> kline: heh, I've heard "handraulic" in a similar context
[03:11:15] <kline> takes loads of time and effort, usually attention to detail is key, and youll likely end up solving problems related to - essentially - balancing books
[03:11:21] <manicennui> kline: Never heard of that word.
[03:11:29] <kline> but the task itself isnt inherently complex or requiring particular skill
[03:11:34] <manicennui> (I looked it up)
[03:12:02] <kline> manicennui, to be fair, ive never heard it not at work
[03:12:09] <manicennui> My biggest issue with frontend development is that it would require me to have a bunch of knowledge of things I don't want to know about.
[03:12:09] <kline> or outside or work, more clearly

[03:19:14] <symgryph> ok
[03:19:35] <symgryph> it might be a side effect of my rss aggregrator
[03:19:41] <kline> this is so that your reader can keep track of posts without the rss feed file having to trend towards being infinitely long to capture every single article ever posted
[03:20:10] <kline> its quite normal for entries to be removed from rss feeds, as in only show the most recent N entries, and feed readers retain everything theyve seen for your convenience
[03:20:33] <kline> in this situation, its impossible for the reader to know if it was deliberately removed, or it just fell off the "top" stories and is still valid

[04:20:41] <eletrotupi> hello, is there a channel dedicated to sysadmin, server management, etc?
[04:20:49] <eletrotupi> *a irc channel
[04:21:50] <rslabbert> Don't have an account but thought it was worth a comment on the recent "Why you should build on Kubernetes from day one" post. The very first element given for why we should be using Kubernetes is that managed k8s services do a lot of heavy lifting and then referes to Azure's k8s service. I worry that this gives people the wrong idea about how easy these services actually are. Yes, spinning up a cluster is as simple as clicking a button, but as soon 
[04:22:42] <rslabbert> as you need to need to do anything more complicated like make it secure, do backups, monitor and log, it gets very complicated quickly
[04:22:53] <rslabbert> *Especially* on Azure
[04:23:36] <meff[m]> Isn't that just as complicated on a non-k8s architecture?
[04:24:15] <rslabbert> Depends on the maturity of the k8s implementation I think, but generally there are different trade offs
[04:24:38] <meff[m]> I think the trick here is to show that one set of trade-offs is demonstrably better or worse than another
[04:24:42] <rslabbert> Instead of running a VM and ensuring you have patching and whatnot setup, you instead end up tuning k8s nodes
[04:25:07] <rslabbert> For me the big thing you're giving up is that in a managed k8s environment you give up a lot of control
[04:25:38] <meff[m]> if I'm trading the complexity of VM management with k8s orchestration, I'm just moving the complexity. If standardization is a benefit, then you k8s offers a slight net win. If the original complexity is traded though.
[04:25:46] <meff[m]> Well sure. All abstraction is about giving up control.
[04:25:49] <rslabbert> Issues go from "I need to do x to solve this" to "this is a technical limitation of the platform"
[04:26:09] <rslabbert> I think it's the extent of the limitations?
[04:26:29] <rslabbert> And also, this is a bit Azure specific. I've found the other clouds to be a bit better around this.
[04:26:39] <Church> eletrotupi: #reddit-sysadmin or maybe #reddit-homelab
[04:26:42] <meff[m]> Right I think it would be great for more folks to explore these limitations
[04:27:21] <meff[m]> At $WORK we have a stalled project to move the company to k8s that may become effectful any decade or two, but the amount of incidental complexity our homegrown system has is pretty insane at times
[04:27:37] <meff[m]> It was developed before k8s and independent of it
[04:28:02] <rslabbert> Agree that standardisation is a benefit. I still think k8s (or nomad or etc.) is still a better approach than having a sprawl of ways to manage things
[04:28:14] <rslabbert> I think I'm just hesitant to calling it "easy"
[04:28:51] <meff[m]> I think the moment you find service discovery essential more than just useful, your architecture ceases being "easy". The problems are just too great and the failure modes too many
[04:29:43] <rslabbert> Curious to hear more about the internal system that was developed if you're comfortable sharing. Was it influenced by the other tools in this space (e.g. borg/mesos)?
[04:30:20] <meff[m]> It was probably influenced by Borg/Mesos yeah, but from what I remember working with Mesos, it's still conceptually a bit far from it.
[04:30:37] <meff[m]> We have our own custom service-discovery layer not built atop nomad or anything else, again developed before this stuff became common outside. Let me tell you how fun it is when the backing store for the SD layer has a hot shard, breaking newly booting boxes
[04:30:58] <rslabbert> Fully agree on service discovery. That speaks to a certain amount of organisational complexity that I think is unhealthy to adopt alongisde k8s from the get go
[04:31:01] <rslabbert> Ouch haha
[04:31:39] <rslabbert> The tools we have today are definitely a lot better, I just think articles that ignore the baggage they come with are a bit dangerous to the broader discourse
[04:32:21] <rslabbert> But agree that most people these days don't have to deal with things like etcd failures breaking your control plane, which is an objectively better state than having a custom developed solution in this space (for most)
[04:37:28] <meff[m]> If you're really unlucky, after the hot shard has been fixed, your DB service comes up and thundering herd downs it again LOL
[04:38:30] <meff[m]> Yeah it's tricky; I think the context for a lot of these articles is the "We don't use Kubernetes" anti-hype hype train. As such it's trying to take the same overbroad hammer to this problem space that "Kubernetes sucks" uses and likewise ends up missing the mark
[04:38:47] <meff[m]> I do welcome more reasoned analyses of the trade-offs here; it's the only way to move SOTA forward
[04:40:48] *** Quits: m3wzx5 (~m3wzx5@user/m3wzx5) (Remote host closed the connection)
[04:41:21] <meff[m]> I think the table stakes here should be for folks to describe the TPS they're expecting, the reliability, and the deployment cadence. That alone should give us a decent understanding into which architectures surface which pain points for which situations.
[04:42:44] <rslabbert> I think you've just put more thought into a hypothetical situation than most folks put into their real situations
[04:43:05] <meff[m]> Heh I do a lot of this for $WORK is probably why
[04:44:42] <meff[m]> I honestly suspect a lot of the mismatch here is that you have folks running two-nine reliability services with 20 TPS trying to understand why you'd need k8s and then folks running 2E6 TPS with five-nines wondering how you can live without it
[04:46:44] *** Joins: l554 (~l554@user/l554)
[04:47:56] <meff[m]> And of course this assumes you are using a scale-out architecture and not something like a scale-up architecture, so ð¤·. It's a large problem space the more solutions the merrier.
[04:48:42] <meff[m]> Though I wonder if k8s is edging into the https://www.gwern.net/Holy-wars territory

[04:51:33] <rslabbert> Hmmm yeah I think it probably is
[04:51:34] <rslabbert> I
[04:51:44] <rslabbert> I'm honestly just really torn on k8s
[04:51:56] <meff[m]> I hesitate to say so right now just because there are still lots of vigorous alternatives, even in the form of say systemd
[04:52:43] <rslabbert> I think it's potentially great to start on and set yourself up for success, but I think most people still don't understand how difficult this can actually be
[04:53:13] <meff[m]> Yeah I certainly think anything like k8s should only be explored if you really expect that scale
[04:53:20] <meff[m]> The scale where you need to care about all of these things
[04:53:38] <rslabbert> I think we're seeing one of the common problems that pops up in a lot of the world: Tools are designed for small scale, or large scale, but not medium scale
[04:53:49] <meff[m]> But idk, there's the argument that if the abstraction is clean enough, then there's no need not to embrace it. An OS comes to mind. It's not like everyone writes code and sets up interrupt handlers in `main()` or w/e
[04:53:56] <meff[m]> Yes so much that rslabbert
[04:54:16] <rslabbert> Something like https://github.com/coreos/fleet had a lot of potential imo to your point about systemd
[04:54:17] <mockturtle> [ GitHub - coreos/fleet: fleet ties together systemd and etcd into a distributed init system ] - github.com
[04:54:35] <meff[m]> And also the scaling path from small to large is painful, while operating tools meant for large scale on small scale architecture just has tons of footguns for devs and ops
[04:55:13] <meff[m]> Interesting. I haven't seen fleet before, that's cool
[04:55:23] <rslabbert> That's a good point around os which reminds me of: http://addxorrol.blogspot.com/2020/07/the-missing-os.html

[04:57:14] <meff[m]> I thought CoreOS was kinda an attempt at that?

[04:58:19] <srp> meff[m]: got merged into Fedora and RHEL
[04:58:32] <srp> so there's Fedora CoreOS and RHEL CoreOS
[04:58:40] <meff[m]> oh fancy, makes sense why Fleet ties together systemd and etcd
[04:59:45] <srp> there's also this one other CoreOS-like distro that i can't remember the name of

[05:09:30] <rslabbert> Good point around Fuschia. It does seem to be designed around the primites from the get go
[05:09:56] <meff[m]> Yeah I have a friend who works on Fuschia who keeps shilling it to me lol.
[05:10:07] <rslabbert> I'm reminded of Joyent's docker integration, which is that you do docker ps and you see all the containers in the cloud, it's not scoped to a single machine, and that's just because the API is well designed
[05:10:28] <meff[m]> yeah exactly
[05:10:43] <rslabbert> It feels like there's an approach where a single VM has the same API for orchestration as the cluster, the control plane just adds in... orchestration?
[05:11:18] <meff[m]> The trouble is how to deal with control plane issues
[05:11:38] <meff[m]> oops your api gateway's thread pools are saturated, time to sit and spin
[05:12:00] <meff[m]> That's where I think designing your code to be distributed (e.g. anticipate retries and failures) from the start helps
[05:12:03] <rslabbert> You mean we can't just throw CockroachDB at it and pretend that distributed ACID solves all our issues?
[05:12:08] <meff[m]> lol
[05:12:24] <rslabbert> (though I think that's not the worst idea in the world)
[05:12:34] <rslabbert> Funny, I think Histrix had so much potential as well
[05:12:49] <meff[m]> This reminds me of a great outage we had where a critical internal service went down but every time we tried to get it back up it kept going down because of thundering herd issues
[05:13:17] <meff[m]> Since we provisioned `n` boxes, but they would enter load balancer at different times, enough to have the incoming traffic melt each box as it entered load balancer
[05:14:25] <rslabbert> It's funny because building your services to be resilient to that kind of failure feels a bit silly unless you've seen the error before
[05:14:40] <meff[m]> Yeah
[05:14:45] <rslabbert> You're spending all your time coding timeouts and backoffs and circuit breakers for something that might not happen
[05:14:56] <meff[m]> Well we had a caching layer but the cache was flushed by the time the cluster would come back up
[05:15:35] <meff[m]> I think we ended up bringing up the boxes, running synthetic traffic on them once they came up to warm up caches, and then marking them as ready to take traffic
[05:15:37] <rslabbert> I love "I flushed the cache and now everything is breaking from the load" issues
[05:15:40] <rslabbert> Not at the time

[07:44:10] <nightbreak> Imagine if a sufficiently talented adversary infected the Windows build machines at Microsoft to generate bad Windows ISOs. Eventually, Microsoft engineers will use a bad copy of Windows to develop Windows, and that bad copy of Windows automatically injects malicious code into a new version, and so on and so forth.

[10:36:40] <letoram> should there be some level of trolling to it? I'm thinking of going back to Jon Postel and showing him REST.
[10:37:39] <manicennui> It would probably need to focus on much bigger names.

[10:39:32] <manicennui> Grace Hopper might be another good choice.

[16:04:31] <iDrougge> ignaloidas: What are you missing from Python's stdlib?
[16:05:24] <ignaloidas> iDrougge, for one, I don't see any real reasons besides maybe licensing as to why requests shouldn't be in stdlib
[16:05:50] <Foxboron> ignaloidas: versioning is a real reason. But requests might have stabilized enough now
[16:06:10] <c355e3b> The stdlib versioning stuff bit ruby hard for a while
[16:06:14] <ignaloidas> a few more encodings like asn1 and cbor should probably be in stdlib as well
[16:06:32] <c355e3b> and maybe openssl wrappers?
[16:06:38] <Foxboron> Also the fact that is uses out-of-tree library dependencies is a big problem I reckon

[16:06:55] <ignaloidas> Foxboron, asyncio is very much a counter-argument to that, look at how much it changed recently
[16:07:48] <ignaloidas> contribution frequency also has died down in requests massively since 2020
[16:07:52] <Foxboron> ignaloidas: still tied to the python release schedule.
[16:08:05] <ignaloidas> Foxboron, and what's bad with that?
[16:08:14] <Foxboron> The largest hurdle is probably upstreaming urllib3 I reckon
[16:08:26] <c355e3b> ignaloidas, people don't upgrade python
[16:08:31] <Foxboron> ignaloidas: security patching mainly.
[16:08:37] <c355e3b> I still see customers use 2.7 for *new* greenfield projects
[16:08:42] <Foxboron> You also loose out on rapid development cycles, but that shouldn't be relevant these days
[16:08:43] <ignaloidas> isn't urllib3 in stdlib??

[16:09:46] <ignaloidas> and I really don't want to devolve to JS where there is no stdlib
[16:10:00] <c355e3b> Well, they expect my team to support it
[16:10:04] <mgdm> I think (though I could be wrong) that urllib3 is a dependency for pip so a lot of people have it around even if it's not in the stdlib
[16:10:30] <c355e3b> So we can't do "new" things because we need 2.7 compatibility
[16:10:34] <ignaloidas> urllib3 probably should be in stdlib as well
[16:10:43] <iDrougge> ignaloidas: HTTP requests?
[16:10:44] <Foxboron> c355e3b: pip depends on requests :p

[18:00:46] <polve> I remember it having !uniprot definitively sold me on it
[18:00:47] <ignaloidas> I usually either know where to find something, or default to google
[18:01:15] <ignaloidas> maybe bangs would help, but just having the specific sites is good enough

[18:03:31] <polve> gwozniak: I agree that basic ddg search is not that good

[18:36:49] <ignaloidas> vscode is very good for js work from what I see
[18:37:44] <dimadima> i've only used vscode after using vim for a long time and it's pretty good
[18:37:56] <dimadima> i mean, i guess i've spent a ton of time in intellij, but that's a different beast?
[18:38:31] <dimadima> can't imagine going back to js having used ts now, though. was just thinking yestrday if i got a job offer with js, would i take it? i don't think so...
[18:38:59] <dimadima> programming without types is just difficult for me
[18:39:23] <c355e3b> The ecosystem around typescript is really off-putting for me.
[18:39:31] <c355e3b> Its to the point where I want mlton to emit js
[18:40:41] <dimadima> ignaloidas: took a look at gitgraph and ungit. git graph looks good but i think i'm good with git show-branch, and right now i'm a lone dev so my branching is very simple. ungit i will look at more

[18:42:07] <dimadima> lol
[18:42:15] <c355e3b> See, that causes issues
[18:42:17] <dimadima> fwiw with nextjs that's pretty good
[18:42:38] <dimadima> react-create-app is a nightmare.

[19:28:31] <gwozniak> That may work, but I bet getting it in GCC is a real pain

[19:50:29] <cb> so yeah suffer along with me
[19:51:56] <ngoldbaum> at least if i get a playdate the games will run at 60 fps :p
[19:52:10] <cb> look dude i can play deus ex on public transportation
[19:52:13] <cb> remember buses?
[19:52:23] <ngoldbaum> the real question is if i should get the ludicrous poolside.fm speaker
[19:52:36] <cb> podcasts were a mistake
[19:52:37] <cb> won't
[19:53:07] <ngoldbaum> cb: i wonder how well it can play human revolution
[19:53:29] <cb> ngoldbaum: prob 60 FPS max settings at 720p i bet
[19:53:33] <ngoldbaum> mankind divided was also pretty great tbh, i wish they got to make more instead of the avengers game
[19:53:42] <cb> it ran that way on my core 2 duo  with a 750ti
[19:53:46] <indigo> Steam deck is broke, playdate is woke
[19:53:51] <cb> it should haul ass on that zen+rdna

[19:54:38] <c355e3b> it felt like the last boss was end of act 1

[19:54:47] <ngoldbaum> the bank level though
[19:54:50] <cb> MD was  great game cut short
[19:55:06] <cb> i plan to try dishonored 2 to see how well ti runs
[19:55:16] <cb> it ran like, 720p all low on my old core 2 duo
[19:55:18] <c355e3b> The bank was great
[19:55:22] <cb> when i got my ryzen it ran exactly the same
[19:55:28] <c355e3b> I really like how they handled all of the versions of prauge
[19:55:30] <cb> so i wonder if the deck will change much

[19:57:15] <hschmale> cb: Is the steam deck not going to be amazing?
[19:57:46] <cb> hschmale: ok so i have a lot of reservations along with hope
[19:57:58] <cb> mostly bc i studied the trash fire of steam machines from a business perspective
[19:58:05] <cb> it seems valve learned a lot of lessons
[19:58:58] <hschmale> The steam machines were disappointing and steamos was hot garbage.
[19:58:59] <cb> tho some stuff has me worried
[19:59:09] <cb> i.e. with the open nature of it be a cop-out when something just doesn't work ootb
[19:59:13] <hschmale> But I'm very excited about it being arch based.
[19:59:19] <cb> i dont care about the foundations
[19:59:21] <hschmale> I've had almost zero issues with steam on arch.
[19:59:25] <cb> i want it to be a nice product
[19:59:32] <hschmale> But plenty of issues on other distros.
[19:59:38] <iDrougge> Steam is the main reason I don't play games on computers.
[19:59:40] <cb> i'm i dotn have the free time to install arch nor do i care about it; i just care if it works
[19:59:40] <hschmale> I think it will be a very nice product.
[19:59:48] <hschmale> Could I get an invite to lobste.rs?
[19:59:57] <cb> i dont want it to be something i need to fiddle with to play games
[20:00:00] <hschmale> Manjaro is arch for the lazy, which is what I plan on using.

[22:49:35] <srp> this guy's critique was because of OBS
[22:49:42] <srp> but i'm pretty certain xwayland works with OBS

[23:00:06] <steenuil> does OBS work with xwayland?
[23:00:13] <steenuil> I recently installed fedora on my new work laptop, which runs wayland by default, and I noticed that Teams wouldn't share my screen
[23:00:45] <srp> OBS updated to support wayland to some degree
[23:00:48] <steenuil> because chrome still doesn't run natively in wayland
[23:00:51] <srp> I also cannot share screens on Discord
[23:01:00] <srp> but i can share applications, bizarrely
[23:01:03] <srp> just without audio
[23:01:06] <steenuil> huh
[23:01:30] <srp> i'm even running discord with the system electron instead of the bundled
[23:01:46] <srp> and that surprisingly hasn't fixed anything despite electron apparently improving things like that
[23:02:02] <srp> i'm hoping that PipeWire gains more traction since it works rather well for this usecase
[23:02:16] <steenuil> ah, fedora also runs pipewire by default
[23:02:18] <steenuil> I did try some test page for the screen sharing API on chrome running in xwayland and it worked, would share my screen
[23:02:24] <steenuil> and windows too
[23:03:22] <srp> i'm on arch but i was a fedora regular for a while
[23:03:26] <srp> i like pipewire
[23:03:43] <srp> the visual-aspect of screensharing seems to get better
[23:03:48] <srp> but audio seems to be neglected
[23:03:58] <srp> i think pulseaudio might work?
[23:04:02] <srp> alsa most likely does
[23:05:08] <technomancy> I got a new machine a while back and I was like "maybe they finally fixed pulseaudio; I could give it another try"
[23:05:10] <technomancy> how foolish of me
[23:05:48] <technomancy> it refuses to play mpd, and it doesn't notice when I plug headphones in; I have to manually select the new output every time I insert/remove

[23:09:53] <srp> i had to add a custom profile for my headphones to be similar to the windows experience (since chat and non-chat sounds are divided normally)

[23:12:14] <technomancy> whoa you had a crash on mainline emacs?
[23:12:33] <gwozniak> Now that I built it myself I'm running a debug build in the hopes I have a useful stack trace. Wow, is it slow
[23:12:35] <technomancy> I haven't had that happen for me in over a decade

[23:13:25] <gwozniak> technomancy: yes, it has happened to me frequently for over a year now.  I suspect it has something to do with sending ESC and C-g

[23:14:51] <gwozniak> I've tried to reproduce it but I never seem to be able to.  Annoyingly, it always happens when I'm busy...

[23:15:35] <srp> cturtle: np, lsusb is your friend in making those rule changes if you aren't aware
[23:16:05] <technomancy> I'm in this weird state where most of the time I'm like "hey remember the old days when programs used to crash?" and then every so often I come across unreliable garbage like pulse where you're honestly surprised when it actually works like it's supposed to.

[23:16:27] <srp> well, let me rephrase that
[23:16:41] <srp> it brought the good parts of pulse to an overall better system
[23:17:13] <technomancy> 100% guaranteed Lennart-free audio.

[23:17:53] <srp> i'm just hopeful that we'll see programs take advantage of the capture aspect for screensharing
[23:18:02] <gwozniak> I run Ubuntu 20.04 on my desktop which I use only via SSH.  I also have my speakers hooked up to it and use it to listen to music when I'm working in my office.
[23:18:10] <srp> since the current options are basically nonexistent for wayland
[23:18:28] <gwozniak> To get pulseaudio to work, I had to change the display manager
[23:18:42] <cturtle> srp: I was not aware. I haven't poked much into pipewire yet, so thanks for the info
[23:19:31] <srp> cturtle: pipewire is honestly the easiest part about this, you'll likely only have to change that rules file
[23:19:31] <gwozniak> I switched to xdm and manually change the permissions on /dev/snd devices because there apparently is no way to do this with systemd and pulseaudio
[23:19:37] *** Joins: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice)
[23:20:03] <srp> cturtle: and of course, you can change the other files to reflect your device so that way you don't see "Nari Ultimate" in your outputs :P
[23:20:10] <technomancy> gwozniak: you can't really expect two programs like systemd and pulseaudio to work together; it's not like they were written by the same pers--oh wait

[23:21:02] <rhn_mk1> it looks wrong
[23:21:04] <gwozniak> The problem is that the standard Gnome display manager takes over pulseaudio and there's no way to access it if the display manager is running and you're not logged in via the display manager
[23:21:04] <srp> actually nvm that "Nari Ultimate" part seems to be false

[23:21:50] <af> srp: eh why not I'm free anyway
[23:22:27] <srp> af: i'd imagine the more clunky aspects will be the parts that deal with integrating with pulseaudio, jack, alsa, gstreamer
