[21:12:27] <Wafficus> hey there, does anyone have any good recommendations on some CSS blog posts to deploy a super simple, minimal thumbnail style art gallery page?
[21:12:59] <stenno> sounds like a job for grid?
[21:13:02] <Wafficus> I tried using a Wordpress site, but got the white page of death, so ultimately, now I just want to somehow dump photos into a directory, and just figure out how to incorporate them onto a page with thumbnails, etc
[21:13:09] <stenno> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
[21:13:10] <Wafficus> stenno: hey there, can you link me up?
[21:13:12] <Wafficus> thanks
[21:14:11] <Wafficus> I'm wondering if it would be worthwhile to figure out how to inject new images into the HTML of a page automatically through a cronjob on the VPS hosting my site
[21:14:26] <Wafficus> or if I should somehow force the page to refer to a JSON file containing a listing of all the images instead
[21:14:47] <Wafficus> I know my question is slightly convoluted, but if you kind of get what I'm asking, can anyone point me in the right direction on how to make that possible?
[21:15:21] <entuland> you should separate the source and the presentation of your data
[21:15:48] <entuland> in a CMS / CMF you may want to set up a content type with fields containing all the images you want to include in such a gallery
[21:16:05] <Wafficus> CMS, CMF?
[21:16:12] <Wafficus> *what are these acronyms if you don't mind me asking
[21:16:15] <entuland> content management system
[21:16:18] <Wafficus> ah I see
[21:16:20] <entuland> content management framework
[21:16:35] <Wafficus> thanks
[21:16:46] <entuland> once you're using such things, you should try and not go against the grain and cooperate with it
[21:17:17] <entuland> so you may want to create a post type with specific fields on WP, so that you can manage the images and any associated data from the WP interface
[21:17:21] <Wafficus> yeah I'm torn between just having a huge page of smaller thumbnails and having the user just click them to show them in better detail in a hovered page, or if I should link out to each separate page
[21:17:35] <entuland> yes, you need to decide about those details
[21:17:36] <Wafficus> Or, to do an art gallery type page with fake art gallery white walls with the photos on each section, etc
[21:17:47] <Wafficus> yeah I don't really want WP though
[21:17:55] <Wafficus> I have one working WP instance on my site as a separate sub section
[21:18:04] <Wafficus> but the Art Gallery one I attempted kept getting the white page of death
[21:18:11] <Wafficus> and I'm done with trying to debug it so I nuked that
[21:18:21] <Wafficus> I just want to do basic CSS to pull it off if possible
[21:18:21] <stenno> doesn't sound like a CSS problem to be fair
[21:18:27] <entuland> that's up to you, but it's not like you will not have to debug any custom solution
[21:18:31] <Wafficus> true, but he mentioned WP stenno
[21:18:36] <entuland> yes, CSS is definitely the last step
[21:19:06] <Wafficus> yeah the goal is not posts really
[21:19:14] <Wafficus> just a page of images, and thumbnails, that's about it
[21:19:16] <entuland> okay
[21:19:18] <Wafficus> a photo dump site if you will
[21:19:38] <entuland> if you're happy with just creating the HTML with all the links yourself after you've uploaded the images, why not
[21:20:24] <entuland> if you want to automate it, you need some kind of server side language, such as PHP, to generate such an HTML out of a JSON file or just out of the contents of a folder
[21:20:35] <entuland> but as mentioned, those would be outside the scope of #css
[21:20:48] <Rockwood> Wafficus, are you talking about WP?
[21:21:23] <Wafficus> entuland makes sense, I was thinking to just use a Python script as the regular user on that box via a crontab job
[21:21:46] <Wafficus> if anything, if its possible, I just wanted to refer to images to literally point to a JSON file that contain a directory listing of images
[21:21:55] <entuland> you can use Python just as fine if you know how to do that and you have it available on the server
[21:22:05] <Wafficus> that would probably be the easiest thing instead of having to create a ton of <img/> tags afterwards
[21:22:07] <entuland> #python has plenty of users if you need help with it
[21:22:21] <Wafficus> gotcha, yeah I'm just trying to figure out the CSS style layout I want
[21:22:49] <Wafficus> grid container with 'justify-content: end' seems the most doable
[21:23:03] <entuland> there are many different approaches, yes, it really depends on how you want it to look and behave

[21:24:56] <entuland> there is some JS there but you can achieve something very similar, also with transitions, with little to no JS
