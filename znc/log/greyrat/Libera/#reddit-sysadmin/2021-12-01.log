[08:23:51] <Cl0udNinja> I'm sorta disappointed that tools like packer and terraform are the norm for those types of tools
[08:24:11] <Cl0udNinja> their structure and design decisions sometimes really bother me
[08:24:14] <Work-BWMerlin> How so (I have used neither and don't know what they do)
[08:24:39] <Cl0udNinja> Packer is for creating images on almost any provider, and terraform is like an IaC format/tool
[08:25:23] <Cl0udNinja> Neither of them utilize any kind of standard between modules/providers, so any time you want to make a something for a provider using that tool, 80% of the work is not reusable
[08:26:08] <Cl0udNinja> and then another argument is in their flag choice... using `-flag` instead of `--flag`

[18:36:10] <SirSceptalot> I guess? I don't suppose you have access to the licensing info to check? Free or trial licenses usually have something like 9999 activations available

[18:36:32] <lancehead> fuck 
[18:36:39] <mistiry> PublicWiFi: if you are in an EA, they probably didnt pay for them up front, but would have to True-Up the license costs later
[18:37:02] <PublicWiFi> not sure about the EA :(
[18:37:08] <PublicWiFi> its MAK yeah
[18:37:41] <mistiry> so EA then, i imagine
[18:38:00] <PublicWiFi> hmm we've been using this license for a couple years now and I haven't had an bills
[18:38:03] <PublicWiFi> hmmm
[18:38:08] <mistiry> number of activations against a MAK is determined by the volume license agreement. so might not be EA, but is at least a volume license agreement.
[18:38:17] <mistiry> EA's are usually multi-year
[18:38:19] <PublicWiFi> yeah I'd assume vol
[18:38:22] <PublicWiFi> vol license
[18:38:30] <PublicWiFi> so that means the 100 is true?

[18:38:55] <mistiry> it means that particular MAK can be activated 100 times total
[18:39:15] <mistiry> I have no clue if it means an up-front cost was paid, or if you have to True-Up the actual usage at a later date.
[18:39:19] <PublicWiFi> right

[19:18:29] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> You really just need to check if something is null in the table so ISNULL and COALESCE are kinda wasted. You don't need it to 'fall back' to some safe value, you need it to just evaluate if null
[19:19:43] <JollyRgrs> @Killnine that's basically what i'm doing... but failing
[19:19:53] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> ALTERNATIVELY, you could make the string you're passing into your substring safe by using ISNULL or COALESCE. But that's hard because SUBSTRING is position-based.

[19:21:29] <teh_f4ll3n> that makes it -999999999 overall, fritzwastaken 
[19:22:03] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> Here's what I would think about doing:
[19:22:03] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> 
[19:22:03] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> use a temp table with some sample data and then run the query against that since you'll have more control over the data executing
[19:23:12] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> Make it look like the table you're actually querying from and even include a small subset of `DN` records you think are OK. Then you'll be able to narrow down to what's making substring blow up
[19:24:01] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> Also, is there a way you could just do a select on all the DN records and verify that there's no messed up ones in the list?
[19:24:07] <JollyRgrs> i might do that next, i'm really not good at the temp table stuff, but i've had to do it a few times before
[19:24:38] <teh_f4ll3n> select into should get you there :)
[19:25:07] <JollyRgrs> that's what i'm doing now, selecting the DNs and seeing if there's something funky that I wasn't expecting
[19:25:11] <JollyRgrs> oh.... that'll do it...
[19:25:20] <JollyRgrs> results are in... they aren't null... just empty
[19:25:25] <JollyRgrs> i think tehre's also an ISEMPTY right?
[19:25:25] <teh_f4ll3n> lol
[19:25:31] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> Yup
[19:25:43] <JollyRgrs> sigh. #ThanksSQL

[19:25:58] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> no ISEMPTY
[19:26:02] <JollyRgrs> so can isempty check for null or do I need to use both?
[19:26:03] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> you have to use LEN()
[19:26:14] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> t.DN IS NULL OR t.DN = ''
[19:26:15] <JollyRgrs> ok, so check if LEN 0?
[19:26:18] <teh_f4ll3n> yup
[19:26:29] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> That's what I would probably do
[19:26:33] <teh_f4ll3n> or just '' as value
[19:26:38] <sd> 08<b‚Äãdenlinger> noooo
[19:27:03] <JollyRgrs> yeah, that's what i'm doing teh_f4ll3n 
[19:27:11] <JollyRgrs> just added one extra case for when = ''
[19:27:18] <mistiry> inb4 its not null OR empty. its some weird non-visible character.

[19:57:49] <MoonBounce> why do people use
[19:57:55] <MoonBounce> email for critical alerts that are time sensitive
[19:58:14] <MoonBounce> if the email coming in 30 minutes late is that important, maybe it should be a text or something no?
[19:58:23] <teh_f4ll3n> because they can't be arsed to set up anything else?
[19:58:46] <teh_f4ll3n> I don't check my phone during the day at all

[19:59:04] <teh_f4ll3n> so text would be seen later than an email or a whatsapp message
[19:59:32] <teh_f4ll3n> I dump all critical alerts into Slack via the API
[20:00:50] <ropegoatin> ^^ slack or teams webhooks are the way to go IMO as well
[20:01:46] <mistiry> until slack is down
[20:02:00] <mistiry> Should always have more than one delivery method for critical alerting

[20:03:05] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> critical alerts here become a message on our ticketing website (which is hosted off site) and then a webhook into teams

[20:50:24] <teh_f4ll3n> you can export the cert and upload it to the firewall

[20:50:47] <sd> 14<K‚Äãillnine> Our firewall also supports LetsEncrypt certs, too. I was under the impression you didn't want to use wildcard cert for a bunch of stuff in case you needed to revoke
