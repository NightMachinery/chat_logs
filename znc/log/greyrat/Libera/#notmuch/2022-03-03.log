[13:03:37] <inwit> I would like to have a tag:sent query in which the authors column is populated with the receivers of the mails, instead of the sender (which is always me, so it's uninformative). Is that possible? How would I go about it?
[13:11:38] <ecraven> did you set your email addresses correctly in ~/.notmuch-config?
[13:11:46] <ecraven> it does exactly what you want for me
[13:11:55] <ecraven> set primary_email and other_email
[13:15:14] <inwit> Yeah, primary_email is properly set. And I don't have any other, so other_email is unset. :-?

[16:55:41] <inwit> It's weird that it works for you, ecraven, and not for me. Maybe there's something in my config, but I have this: ```(setq notmuch-search-result-format         '(("date" . "%12s ")           ("count" . "%-7s ")           ("authors" . "%-20s ")           ("subject" . "%s ")           ("tags" . "(%s)")))```
[16:56:17] <ecraven> I don't change that at all, it's the default for me
[16:57:18] <ecraven> hm.. wait.. I just checked tag:sent, and I actually see my own email there... I seem to have misremembered :-/
[16:58:30] <inwit> At least we're on the same page... :)
[16:58:50] <ecraven> I haven't looked into this in years, but I think it used to work, many years ago?
[16:59:27] <inwit> It's a reasonable thing to have, imho.

[17:45:01] <bremner> not concrete ones. I can imagine a couple of different approaches, either adding per-query formats or using a function in your format. The latter requiring the least upstream change I guess
[17:48:39] <ecraven> so this was never something that worked, even years ago?
[17:48:54] <bremner> not afaik
[17:49:01] <bremner> maybe in a different front end?
[17:51:47] <ecraven> hm.. I never used anything but emacs.. maybe that was wanderlust (which I briefly tried before).. thanks!
[17:52:08] <ecraven> would it make sense to have an option to just *never* show your *own* email in any threads?
[17:52:41] <ecraven> does emacs calculate the string to show, or does that come from notmuch?
[17:55:35] <bremner> I imagine you can ask 3 people and get 6 answers about any UI issue
[17:55:59] <bremner> I can't remember how much is done on the emacs side.

[23:18:11] <haasn> What do y'all use to access mail from a mobile phone? Standard IMAP? Or is there anything that understands notmuch tagging?
[23:18:37] <haasn> And if IMAP, do you synchronize your notmuch tags back to IMAP folders somehow?
[23:19:05] <haasn> I see https://github.com/aaptel/notmuch-android but it seems like abandonware
[23:20:14] <bremner> currently I don't use my phone for email. Previously I used "noservice", a web interface.
[23:25:49] <acdw> i use the fastmail app but not often
