[02:44:25] <bpalmer> one way to do it, I usppose, would be to look at the byte compiler and see primitives it supports.
[02:44:32] <corwin> nij-: you will probably need to work from sources, meaning you need to pick a version of emacs to support and, over time, will need to maintain support for different Emacs versions.  elisp isn't versioned other than per the Emacs version implementing it.
[02:44:51] <wasamasa> yeah, it's a slowly evolving moving target
[02:45:02] <wasamasa> seems like an exercise in frustration
[02:45:03] <nij-> bpalmer: Thought about it before? I'm curious what are some major obstacles. 
[02:45:07] <wasamasa> what do you want to actually do?
[02:45:08] <bpalmer> you'd end up with *terrible* common lisp but that's ok, if the CL is simply a compile target, not something supposed to be human editable.
[02:45:37] <nij-> corwin: Has emacs upgrades broken elisp backward-compatibility before?
[02:45:47] <nij-> (Not saying emacs itself, but elisp.)
[02:46:10] <nij-> wasamasa: The actual goal is to let CLimacs 2 run elisp completely.
[02:46:20] <wasamasa> lol
[02:46:23] <nij-> bpalmer: why terrible?
[02:46:27] <corwin> nij-: it's something emacs-devs try to avoid, but.  yes, very much so.
[02:47:56] <corwin> Hmm.  I guess I might recant that.  I'm having trouble giving a good example that isn't more "editor" than "language".
[02:48:11] * kickingvegas refiling all the scheduled 2021 org tasks to 2022 
[02:48:26] <wasamasa> yeah, the main problem is that there's no clear split
[02:48:27] <corwin> I feel like the reader semantics have change, and bytecoder has changed for sure, but..
[02:48:39] <wasamasa> one recent incompatibility was records
[02:48:45] <corwin> good one
[02:49:22] <corwin> For a elisp to CL transpiler I think one really tricky spot would be the places that (still) don't use lexical binding.
[02:49:48] <wasamasa> the other thing with not having a standard is that people code against behavior and work around bugs
[02:50:10] <corwin> I suspect you'd need to special case every one of those and then manually take care of preserving the environment around each call, maybe pushing changes back up the stack after the calls also.

[03:23:07] <random-nick> there's certainly a lot, if you need want absolutely all elisp to run, you would basically have to reimplement gnu emacs in CL
[03:23:09] <wasamasa> it's not a general purpose programming language, yes

[03:24:51] <wasamasa> well, running existing elisp code isn't how you do better
[03:24:57] <wasamasa> look at freebsd's linux emulation
[03:25:06] <wasamasa> it's considered a curiosity
[03:25:08] <random-nick> yes, but some things gnu emacs does might be rather undesirable in second climacs
[03:25:18] <wasamasa> people would rather port software to work on freebsd

[03:26:03] <nij-> But if I can port the core of emacs-lisp, the rest will work - forever, until they introduce a breaking upgrade.
[03:26:08] <wasamasa> it's not nearly as hard on UNIX-like operating systems
[03:26:30] <wasamasa> you already have a working platform of common assumptions

My emacs.exe is a 64-bit executable.  But maybe I should name the file as libxml2-2.dll.  Who knows?  How do I discover that?

[04:17:28] <wasamasa> no, but your emulator needs subr.el to work

[05:43:33] <JTR[m]1> ...which is the idea behind defcustom. I think. 
[05:44:06] <wasamasa> defcustom defines a variable and describes all that's necessary to know to present a customization interface for it
[05:44:11] <JTR[m]1> is setq an assignment then? That's what gives it an assignment that doesn't change.

[05:53:41] <wasamasa> the difference between C-M-x and C-x C-e is that the former evaluates the form around point and the latter the sexp before point
[05:53:43] <corwin> M-x allows us to enter commands at a promot.  C-M-x is just an example of such a command, already bound.  Thus, if you highlight your updated customize form and do M-x eval-defun   you should get the same result as from C-M-x
[05:53:46] <bpalmer> you only use C-M-x when you're developing elisp ; it is special cased for defvar (and, apparently, defcustom) only because when somebody is writing a mode, they might need to be playing around with the initial value.
[05:54:25] <bpalmer> Somebody not actively writing an elisp library doesn't have much need for it.

[06:00:49] <JTR[m]1> ah! I see what it does. ok.
[06:00:50] <corwin> major modes usually define things like critical key-bindings and syntax parsing rules.  minor modes tend to add functions that work for more than one major mode.

[06:01:37] <corwin> so we have one major mode at a time start from the base of fundumental and mostly heading for text-mode or some non-text (e.g. code, command interaction, etc.) mode.
[06:01:42] <JTR[m]1> now C-M-x does something
[06:02:51] <corwin> Hrm.  Said that pretty badily.   modes are derived from one and other, is what I'm getting at.  And one or another major mode is always active for each buffer.

[06:06:08] <corwin> Emacs doesn't automatically update any code files as user settings are updated.
[06:06:20] <corwin> Except in the special case of the customize-variables section of the init file.

[06:10:29] <corwin> JTR[m]1: I think what you were thinking about was "following" the variables you want to customize back to their definitions, so you can check if any "magic" beyond a `setq' was going on when you bypass customize.

[06:22:47] <JTR[m]1> corwin: I want the current time. not the modification time. 
[06:23:05] <JTR[m]1> the ISO date makes way more sense to me than the UUID which is default 
[06:23:07] <corwin> that's a hell of a lot easier then, you lucky dog.
[06:23:28] *** Quits: niv (~niv@limbo.cypherpunks.io) (Client Quit)
[06:24:06] <corwin> Is the process something like check_if_serial() -or-then-> assign_serial() and update_file() ?
[06:24:14] <JTR[m]1> well, the idea is to have a unique ID that can pinpoint to where the header's at for me. in my case, a date and time (down to seconds) provide a good unique ID, and I know when I created it, which helps. The other part gives me the file name, and that gives me the other hint I want.
[06:25:11] <JTR[m]1> what I found is that org-id already has org-id-method (which I've been talking about here a lot today) which gives you iso already. not in the format I have in the function, but similar. 
[06:25:27] <JTR[m]1> the problem though is the file it's coming from. I can use org-id-prefix, but that only takes a string, not a function (like buffer-name) so I can't use it. 
[06:26:02] <JTR[m]1> I don't know if this makes sense lol. basically function is a "workaround" 
[06:26:06] <corwin> In my case, I have semi-trusted version of similar files sitting around, and I'd like to let people pass chunks around that *should* vary only by their input.  Sometimes we can allow *most* of the rest of the content of the section to be different also (take the new versions for those parts) but some data "burried" in the part of org doc I'm passing around needs to stay with a particular person's version of events.
[06:27:29] <JTR[m]1> what do you mean, should vary by input. what input? 
[06:27:35] <JTR[m]1> sorry I'm a bit slow :p
[06:28:18] <JTR[m]1> maybe an  example?
[06:28:47] <corwin> It's really complicated actually.  I'm not sure how much the example will help.  But. Sure, sec.

[09:10:14] <bpalmer> I wonder if horses in Ecuador take advantage of this to double up on presents.
[09:10:21] <codingquark> A set  can be a null set though
[09:10:43] <ozzloy> https://bpa.st/MDDQ i'm using rackjure, and the indentation is off for the second (and later) key-values in a map
[09:10:47] <corwin> probably a conspiricy by those who promote horse birthday gifts and events.
[09:10:57] <ozzloy> how would i go about fixing this?

[09:17:58] <bpalmer> ("For code, issues, and pull requests"...)
[09:19:23] <bpalmer> ozzloy: the comments in the file are good about discussing indentation; I don't see any special casing for , e.g., rackjure anywhere in this
[09:19:51] <bpalmer> you could manually override or advise the racket-indent-function
[09:19:54] <ozzloy> and there would have to be in order for rackjure's fancy-pants to be indented correctly?
[09:20:10] <corwin> seems most likely, yea
[09:20:30] <corwin> the magic all has to be coded somewhere
[09:20:37] <bpalmer> ozzloy: it also points out the variable racket-indent-curly-as-sequence ; perhaps you can just toggle that and get the behavior you want?
[09:21:02] <ozzloy> where are you seeing that?  i just searched "indent" and i only see it in 3 places
[09:21:11] <ozzloy> 4
[09:21:14] <bpalmer> https://github.com/greghendershott/racket-mode/blob/master/racket-indent.el
[09:21:27] <bpalmer> sorry, I jumped to the bit for indentation, not the main file.
[09:21:46] <ozzloy> ah, yeah, i just found that
[09:21:47] <ozzloy> cool
[09:21:59] <ozzloy> thanks for looking into this

[09:22:43] <ozzloy> it would be cool if the indentation could be based on the semantics and the semantics could be grabbed from racket itself somehow
[09:23:06] <ozzloy> like if emacs could ask racket what kind of thing this area of text is
[09:24:17] <corwin> I think that would be best described as an "enhancement request", notwitstanding it's bpalmer broswing source and me just kibitizing as I say so.
[09:24:17] <bpalmer> ozzloy: aye, although note that sort of introspection works well with code that mostly already parses; it's awkward when you're starting a new file with lots of fragments.
[09:25:37] <bpalmer> ozzloy: I know there's some work out there on LSP for racket, which enables that sort of "have the editor ask a smarter program how much to indent by?" workflow
[09:26:10] <corwin> I'm thinking about trying to setup MMM (multi-mode-mode) back in the day to deal with templates having a mix of HTML, JS and CSS plus whatever scripting language snippets and how frustrating that was to even configure.  Implementing it sounds hard.
[09:26:19] <bpalmer> but I don't know to what extent racket-mode is aware/works with it.
[09:26:45] <ozzloy> looks like i have to set racket-indent-sequence-depth to something more than 0
[09:28:08] *** Quits: pwolf (~pwolf@user/pwolf) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[09:30:57] <corwin> aon, I can't build from master rn. (build build from 28 works gr8)
[09:31:10] <bpalmer> codingquark: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_in_public_domain has a list. Some well known works I recognize that are now public domain include Nanook of the North, Schoenberg's compositions, Winnie the Pooh
[09:31:48] <bpalmer> surprising how many national anthems are in that list; I would have assumed they would be public domain as soon as they were adopted.
[09:32:25] <corwin> rudybot_: how much is that anthom fee for this year's season ticket?
[09:32:43] <bpalmer> Well, Austria and the Anthem of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic -- I guess that's just two.
[09:33:00] <rudybot_> corwin: municipal/justice of the peace/magistrate courts are pretty appalling in much of the country. I've also seen (e.g. in New York State) cases where you pay a fee for a full hearing that's equal to the cost of pleading guilty and paying the ticket
[09:33:56] <codingquark> bpalmer: thanks!

[09:39:34] <ozzloy> woo, that did it
[09:40:02] <ozzloy> it took me a bit, but setting racket-indent-sequence-depth to 10 did it
[09:40:41] <ozzloy> i tried using customize, but idk wtf went wrong there.  so i added (setq racket-indent-sequence-depth 10) to spacemacs.el

[16:11:51] <TDT> With org-roam, kinda curious.  For starting the backend daemon (webserver) - if that's started automatically on launch, then only one instance of emacs can run at a time.  I've been considering either creating a helper function (that would dedicate an instance to org - so load my base org files, start server), or using a try/catch block for the app.  Kinda curious what others have done, if anything, to
[16:11:53] <TDT> mitigate such an issue over just starting the ui on demand.
[16:12:18] <TDT> And I should mention, I mean org-roam-ui, which is a web app that can visualize org-roam files and their network.

[22:02:02] <fsbot> [1]  Terminals have limitations compared to the graphical windows; it's advisable to use "graphical" Emacs unless one has a good reason not to. See ,betterdefaults for disabling scroll bars, tool bars, etc.

[22:02:11] <fsbot> [3] alternatively, emacs provides a mechanism to work around such limitations via the C-x @ keymap, see C-x @ C-h for details
[22:02:11] <fsbot> [4] see (info "(efaq) Colors on a TTY") for help with 24-bit color enablement in terminal environments
[22:02:48] <aidalgol> johnjaye: See the first URL, but short answer is Shift+Space is not an ASCII character.

[22:05:08] <mfiano> the Unix terminal model treats them identically. To distinguish between the two, you need a programming environment that supports key up / key down events. That is possible in X11 and in terminal emulators that support remapping keys.

[22:49:41] <hodapp> '80s music is like the trump card
[22:50:15] <hodapp> though it's interesting to listen to - for instance - Vangelis' soundtrack for Blade Runner, on which he used '80s synths but more like classical composition
[22:50:46] <hodapp> it doesn't sound corny as fuck
[22:51:39] <hodapp> but I guess this is sort of like how there were a lot of early TV shows where 90% of their selling point was "IT'S TELEVISION! LOOK HOW NOVEL!" and the writing and cinematography were just fucking horrible
[22:52:12] <homerj> I think the only genre of music you could really date from 80s,90s,00s,10s is probably rap/hiphop
[22:52:42] <hodapp> whaa? doesn't it end up being extraordinarily easy to date pop from any of those eras?
[22:53:05] <hodapp> because of dead give-aways, like certain synth cliches the '80s used like crazy, and then the advent of things like autotune
[22:53:12] <artefact> italo disco
[22:53:35] <artefact> or anything using iconic synths from these eras, i guess

[22:54:00] <homerj> you could put that anywhere from late 80s to current
