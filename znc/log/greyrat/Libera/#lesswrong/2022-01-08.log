[03:33:01] <catern> what's a good equally-extreme word to say "Without X, your Y project is crippled" without saying "crippled"
[03:33:21] <mjr> fucked?
[03:33:50] <spxtr> hosed
[03:33:53] <saturn2> castrated
[03:33:56] <Gurkenglas> retarded
[03:33:59] <mjr> debilitated?
[03:34:26] <two2thehead> catern, is a non-starter
[03:34:31] <two2thehead> unfeasible
[03:34:53] <two2thehead> erm
[03:35:04] <catern> hm sorry my example is bad
[03:35:16] <two2thehead> 'is a non-starter' was in reference to your sentence and NOT to you. As I hope it is clear :V
[03:35:19] <catern> let me give my full sentence: "Those few external services on the edge of the mostly-isolated development environment are often the most crucial ones; without the ability to run modified versions of them, your development process is crippled."
[03:35:25] <catern> two2thehead: haha yes it's clear
[03:35:57] <Gurkenglas> has no legs
[03:36:16] <catern> Gurkenglas: running blind
[03:36:20] <PlanckWalk> hamstrung
[03:36:33] <catern> paralyzed
[03:36:34] <two2thehead> up a creek without a paddle
[03:36:54] <catern> okay sorry no more bad suggestions which are equally cancellable please
[03:37:09] <PlanckWalk> Oh, I didn't realize that cancellability was the issue
[03:37:25] <catern> it's minor, but yeah, that's my concern with "crippled"
[03:37:40] <PlanckWalk> Severely impeded then?
[03:38:02] <PlanckWalk> Or is "impeded" a cancel-word these days?
[03:38:08] <enterprisey> scuppered
[03:38:10] <catern> hmm
[03:38:11] <Gurkenglas> the idea is that you don't want people reading the sentence and feeling sorry about themselves.
[03:38:12] <saturn2> doubleplusungood
[03:38:15] <PlanckWalk> I like scuppered!
[03:38:42] <catern> the ideal would be some word which implies both 1. your life is much harder and 2. you're abnormal
[03:38:49] <catern> crippled really is perfect for that
[03:39:04] <catern> could there even be such a word
[03:39:10] <PlanckWalk> (2) seems incompatible with "not cancellable"
[03:39:18] <catern> right
[03:39:19] <Gurkenglas> "a nerd" :D
[03:39:24] <Gurkenglas> not cancellable anymore!
[03:39:33] <catern> "your development process is an incel"
[03:39:41] <enterprisey> well, there's room for better word choice here because "crippled" implies nothing about the mechanism by which the development process gets fucked
[03:40:02] <enterprisey> there's room for a word that does imply something about the mechanism through subtext
[03:40:21] <saturn2> your development process is harder and queerer
[03:40:29] <PlanckWalk> Mmmm, hard and queer
[03:40:30] <enterprisey> bigger, harder, and longer
[03:40:35] <catern> well... I kind of feel like crippled gives a good visceral feeling of what it's like to wrestle with slow builds and bad tools
[03:41:03] <Gurkenglas> military grade
[03:41:05] <catern> perhaps something like "shackled" (yes I am reading a synonym dictionary)
[03:41:18] <PlanckWalk> Ewww!  Slavery!
[03:41:19] <catern> (uh, or a "thesaurus" as they're called)
[03:41:25] <catern> PlanckWalk: slavery is bad though!
[03:41:31] <enterprisey> with the context of the sentence, I'd do some stronger form of "inconvenienced"
[03:41:42] <catern> oh I guess comparing a bad development process to slavery is cancellable though
[03:42:06] <catern> haha
[03:42:09] <catern> "oppressed"
[03:42:36] <enterprisey> thinking about the word choices here really gives me ample opportunity to reflect on how I didn't get enough sleep
[03:42:47] <catern> "your development process is disadvantaged", "your development process is underprivileged"
[03:42:57] <catern> "deprived"
[03:43:03] <catern> wow deprived is actualy maybe quite good
[03:43:08] <enterprisey> "disrupted"
[03:43:12] <enterprisey> "obstructed"
[03:43:29] <catern> bereaved
[03:43:30] <Gurkenglas> your development process ossifies.
[03:43:32] <enterprisey> "hindered"
[03:44:35] <Gurkenglas> wait dangit i didn't even know that's "becomes bone", also cancellable.
[03:44:56] <catern> why is that cancellable?
[03:45:10] <Gurkenglas> there's a disease where muscles heal up with bone tissue instead.
[03:45:11] <catern> for someone with a rare disease?
[03:45:14] <catern> i see i see
[03:45:36] <enterprisey> in case you weren't joking, I don't think ossified is cancellable
[03:46:07] <catern> enterprisey: I think I'll go with hindered actually
[03:46:22] <catern> vague but whatever
[03:46:27] <catern> ty!

[03:46:37] <enterprisey> any time
[03:47:15] <enterprisey> re vague, a few words on why it's hindered might not be out of place, but that's a judgment call
[03:47:47] <enterprisey> I recently read a blog post proposing that the writing style where everything has to be backed up and justified is tedious
[03:48:17] <Gurkenglas> "without the ability to use mean words, your writing process is..."
[03:48:35] <catern> oh maybe... harmed?
[03:48:59] <catern> "maimed", "mutilated", "disabled", all still cancellable, but the basic "harmed" is ok
[03:49:15] <enterprisey> of the former three I'd only say "disabled" is cancellable
[03:49:34] <catern> maimed is borderline I think, mutilated yeah maybe not
[03:49:34] <enterprisey> "mained" and "mutilated" are merely excessively graphic for the situation of discussing software development

[07:28:30] <kuudes> "Among 1,228,664 persons who completed primary vaccination during December 2020‚ÄìOctober 2021, a total of 2,246 (18.0 per 10,000 vaccinated persons) developed COVID-19 and 189 (1.5 per 10,000) had a severe outcome, including 36 who died (0.3 deaths per 10,000)."
[07:29:08] <spxtr> why is that unexpected?
[07:30:18] <kuudes> the vaccines should not be so effective that only 0.2% of vaccinated got infected?
[07:30:48] <spxtr> what portion of unvaccinated got infected?
[07:30:59] <kuudes> I don't know
[07:31:13] <kuudes> how large fraction of people in usa have got infected during that time?

[07:33:38] <kuudes> 9.8% of us population confirmed infection during the same period
[07:34:13] <kuudes> surely vaccines have not been 50:1 effective against infections
[07:34:38] <spxtr> how to they verify infection?
[07:34:52] <kuudes> this is some sort of registry thingy

[07:36:38] <kuudes> over here media is making headline "out of 1.2M vaccinated americans, only people who had a risk attribute got serious covid"

[07:38:44] <kuudes> 32 million cases in total, but only 2000 of them in the sample? O_o
[07:39:37] <kuudes> random sample of 1.2M americans should have about 1/300 * 32M ~ 0.1M infections
[07:42:31] <kuudes> I guess during that time on average some 30% of us population has been fully vaccinated
[07:44:13] <kuudes> so out of 3.6M vaccinated+unvaccinated there should have been 300k infections, and in the 1.2M vaccinated apparently 2k infections and in the 2.4M unvaccinated thereby 300k-2k = 298k infections?

[09:44:55] <spxtr> I don't think there's all that much benefit to switching right now, but as things progress, programs might support more features on wayland compared to X

[09:46:46] <spxtr> mostly it looks like an interesting new toy I can play around with

[09:57:44] <PapuaHardyNet> that... is a good thing

[09:59:02] <spxtr> PapuaHardyNet: sure, but why should the display server/compositor/whatever have anything to do with that?
[09:59:52] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't get it - UNIX process address space isolation is literally the same sandboxing
[09:59:57] <PapuaHardyNet> this is just status quo bias

[19:33:24] <PapuaHardyNet> you worry too much
[19:33:41] <PapuaHardyNet> the medium is the person - some people can only be reached through twitter, for instance
[19:33:58] <PapuaHardyNet> or worse, instagram
[19:34:13] <PapuaHardyNet> you cannot separate the medium and the person
[19:35:08] <pompolic> that sounds like being confused as to what a person is
[19:37:06] <PapuaHardyNet> it's a heuristic: worrying about using skype is the wrong thing - you cannot separate communicating with someone who prefers to use skype, and using skype
[19:37:24] <PapuaHardyNet> if I decide I want to speak with dbohdan, and he only uses telegram, I must use telegram
[19:37:44] <pompolic> fair enough
[19:38:42] <pompolic> i think it's prudent not to disguise heuristics as claims about objective reality! but i yell at people about that a lot and i'm not sure i'm not just being cranky
[19:39:31] <pompolic> ...also i probably engage in it myself
[19:39:33] <PapuaHardyNet> don't worry about it, you are doing the right thing :)
[19:40:19] <catern> that has nothing do with it though

[19:40:57] <catern> when I used Windows and Pidgin and Skype
[19:41:00] <pompolic> fwiw the interesting counterargument i can think of is not "the medium is not the person" but "there's probably variance across people"
[19:41:12] <catern> obviously, I wouldn't talk to anyone who required me to use Skype these days
[19:42:11] <catern> (and pidgin probably doesn't even usefully function these days now that all IM services have super-closed APIs)

[19:49:25] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. good point
[19:49:41] <PapuaHardyNet> I apologize
[19:49:45] <quanticle> No worries
[19:51:33] <quanticle> RT to the Samsung announcement, it's just further evidence that NFTs and "Web3.0" is the new dot-com boom. Just like in the dot-com boom, companies would take something boring and say it was revolutionary because it was taking place on the Internet (or taking place adjacent to the Internet), today companies are taking boring things and saying they're revolutionary because they're taking place on
[19:51:35] <quanticle> or adjacent to a blockchain. In this case, it's literally just displaying JPEGs, but because the JPEGs come from a blockchain...
[19:52:00] <catern> "RT"?

[19:53:09] <PapuaHardyNet> why the fuck would you want to view who owns what NFT
[19:53:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: I don't do #lw-politics and don't want to get into a discussion but I'll just say, to save you potentially a lot of confusion, that if you take what's supposedly happening in Kazakhstan at face value, then you will be very confused and understand nothing. You *have to* get your news about this from sources that are clued into Russian / CIS politics or else anything you read and hear is completely worthless
[19:54:08] <catern> you only really need the last 8 words of that
[19:54:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> lol, can't argue there
[19:54:42] <PapuaHardyNet> obormot, thanks. I usually avoid politics stuff, but maybe you could DM me sources you think are worth getting started with?
[19:54:47] <pompolic> CIS politics such as trade embargos imposed by The Republic
[19:54:51] <pompolic> wait that's star wars
[19:54:56] <quanticle> Conspicuous consumption is a thing. I'm just amused that being able to display static images downloaded from a website (OpenSea) is now sexy. But overall, I agree: showing off your NFTs is about as impressive as showing off your shares in Google or w/e.
[19:55:23] <PapuaHardyNet> conspicious consumption completely divorced from reality? If you own a yacht, like yeah I get it, but a jpeg?
[19:55:35] <pompolic> actually moxie marlinspike recently made a shitpost nft that changes based on who's viewing it
[19:55:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Nah, I stay away from that stuff nowadays so I don't have any up to date references, at least not in English
[19:55:42] <quanticle> And yes, I 100% agree with Obormot. Most Western commentary about what happens in the former Soviet Union is beyond stupid.
[19:55:47] <pompolic> it's not even a static image but an URL
[19:55:47] <PapuaHardyNet> that's all right
[19:55:57] <pompolic> a URL*
[19:56:15] <quanticle> Yeah, but the URL resolves to an image eventually, right?
[19:56:20] <pompolic> ideally
[19:56:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course it doesn't have to
[19:56:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> You can make an NFT where the URL isn't even valid
[19:56:51] <PapuaHardyNet> It's a simulacrum - the URL is not what actually matters - it is the fact that other people value that thing that you own, that is what actually matters
[19:57:00] <PapuaHardyNet> I have to keep reminding this to myself
[19:57:02] <pompolic> also +1 on the western commentary, so many stupid takes about hungary and i don't even like the place

With contributions from: Kieron Quinn (@Quinny898), Luca Stefani‚Ä¶)
[20:01:35] <quanticle> But it leaves so many further questions open, starting with, "Why the fuck was Google even trying to route 911 through anything but the actual built-in dialer?"
[20:02:30] <pompolic> skimming the article
[20:02:32] <pompolic> yeah
[20:02:42] <pompolic> "There are a few flags apps can set with PhoneAccount, including one called "CAPABILITY_PLACE_EMERGENCY_CALLS." "
[20:03:10] <pompolic> like, you have architecture for an app to register itself to handle emergency functionality
[20:03:32] <pompolic> i think this is good in principle, but i suppose defaults matter
[20:03:53] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, so you recommend we should use iphones only
[20:04:11] <pompolic> nowhere did i say that
[20:04:49] <gwern> pretty classic complex system failure. a lot of individually sensible decisions adding up to a very rare failure
[20:04:54] <pompolic> the problem is, in part "someone with unaligned incentives sets the default on you" and that describes apple garbage to a T
[20:05:03] <pompolic> also +1 to gwern
[20:05:07] <gwern> 'integer overflow? on emergency phone handling? come on, most systems have like 2 or 3 handlers registered, at most'
[20:05:50] <pompolic> i am sure the existence of electron apps is also a many individually-reasonable decisions adding up
[20:05:57] <gwern> corporate policy expiring their account regularly? fairly sensible decision. Teams generating fresh new IDs? I bet that avoided some other bug or failure mode. and so on
[20:06:04] <quanticle> >i think this is good in principle, but i suppose defaults matter
[20:06:04] <pompolic> and then you have a local web browser loading a SPA as "the app"
[20:06:06] <quanticle> I do not think this is good in principle. I think this is absolutely bone-headed design decision. Why should rando VOIP apps be able to register themselves as targets for emergency calls? Has anyone ever thought, "Oh no, grandma's dying, I better use *WhatsApp* to dial an ambulance?"
[20:06:37] <gwern> it sounds like it's a generalization of the 'well, the user has multiple SIMs, as do literally half the mobile users in the entire world, which one do I use?'
[20:07:14] <pompolic> phones' basebands are probably traitor pieces of shit, to be fair
[20:07:28] <quanticle> Yeah, who knows, maybe in India dialing emergency services over WhatsApp is normal
[20:07:34] <pompolic> so i think having the capability to not use it for even emergency is good
[20:07:40] <gwern> if carriers are required to send emergency calls regardless of SIM, maybe that's a bad idea... on the other hand, hahahaha
[20:08:00] <gwern> yeah I can totally see that backfiring and going through whatsapp in india is in fact the safest thing to do
[20:09:23] <pompolic> 2026: you have reached XY county emergency services. please don't forget to join our discord for timely responses
[20:09:36] <gwern> 'why not just punch all emergency calls through sim less to avoid any sim related complexity? carriers are regulatorily required to carry them and so that'll be reliable' ''carrier'? 'regulatorily required to'? 'reliable'? oh you sweet summer child, let me tell you about rural areas and the third world...'
[20:09:52] <quanticle> "Google's fix for this bug is here, titled 'Fix the integer overflow/underflow caused by sorting of duplicate phone accounts during emergency call attempt.' Instead of subtracting one hashcode from another and potentially running into a really big or really small number that crashes the system, Google now runs the two numbers through the java function "Integer.compare." This only returns -1, 0,
[20:09:54] <quanticle> or 1, indicating a smaller, identical, or bigger compare result."
[20:09:56] <quanticle> See, this is what you get when your interview process is a bunch of stupid algorithm questions. You get people who think they're being very clever by writing their own sort function, rather than using the well-tested one built into the programming language.
[20:10:24] <gwern> (are java Integers fixed-width and they have bigints elsewhere?)
[20:10:41] <quanticle> "How hard can this be? I solved this problem in my interview."
[20:15:05] <quanticle> "A third bug in this mess is that Microsoft Teams _does not even register itself as an emergency call handler_. Teams made a million PhoneAccounts, and it did not use the flag 'CAPABILITY_PLACE_EMERGENCY_CALLS,' but it still broke 911. Google's sort process starts with querying all phone accounts when a better first step would be to start with all emergency call-capable phone accounts"
[20:15:07] <quanticle> ü§£üò≠
[20:15:36] <PapuaHardyNet> now *this* is called sorting
[20:17:19] <PapuaHardyNet> lightest overpowered non-macbook laptop, quanticle?
[20:20:17] <quanticle> I have no idea. Lenovo just announced a new X1 Carbon and Dell announced a new XPS (both at CES, which just concluded)
[20:21:07] <PapuaHardyNet> good starting points, thank you!
[20:22:19] <quanticle> If I were you, I'd wait a couple of months if possible. The new models have been announced, but I don't think they're up for sale yet. On the other hand, maybe now's a good time to get a good deal on last-year's stock?
[20:23:08] <PapuaHardyNet> I've been waiting for almost a year to afford a GPU, gave up and bought an x230. Probably push this back for at least half an year so I can buy a workstation, but if not, an XPS or an X1 it will be

[20:24:23] *** voltage is now known as voltage_
[20:24:26] <quanticle> Yeah, the one caveat I have about both of those is that they have soldered RAM, so you can't upgrade the memory yourself. I think the hard drive is upgradeable still, but you should verify.
[20:29:04] <pompolic> oh, so teams didn't register itself as a handler
[20:30:15] <quanticle> No, as I suspected from the beginning, Google threw Microsoft under the bus for this bug.
[20:31:15] <quanticle> To be clear, Teams did have a bug. It should not have been re-registering itself as a call handler whenever the user logged in. But nothing Teams was doing, correctly or incorrectly, should have broken 911 calling.

[21:58:06] <kuudes> humm. the government decided against recommending remote learning
[21:58:28] <kuudes> but the health minister got them to recommend full use of closing indoor spaces to the full extent of the law
[21:58:54] <kuudes> so it appears now possible that the local authorities might need to check if they need to ban being inside school buildings
[21:59:16] <kuudes> because that part of law does not deal with remote learning; providing remote learning is still largely banned
[21:59:38] <kuudes> so maybe they will just ban schools; teaching either is or is not arranged by someone

[22:17:25] <quanticle> "Rather than thinking in terms of the Duchampian readymade, which is most often understood as operating iconically‚Äîas in the appropriation and repositioning of a static thing‚ÄîI was thinking of readymade systems of production, of using pre-existing active systems to produce a work. No object is truly static anyway, so this opened up broader questions I had about the tradition of
[22:17:27] <quanticle> appropriation, the way it froze cultural signifiers and reapplied them to other contexts, treated images as dead, static things‚Ä¶ The object isn‚Äôt treated differently than other FedEx packages, I simply used FedEx to transport an object that registers how the system treated it in aesthetic terms. The result is that the object is constantly changing. Every time the work is shipped it goes
[22:17:29] <quanticle> through a material transformation. There's either oxidation on the copper or an impact on the glass. But it‚Äôs not only that the work changes from point A to point B, but our perception of it also evolves, our experience of the thing is dependent on when it is seen, and who is seeing it."

[22:47:48] <pompolic> i can't not read it as frameshift drive and i keep thinking elon musk is trying to make warp drives
[22:47:48] <adiabatic> is this just tracking the pace of inflation
[22:48:08] <ggreer> right now that just means you get a fancier autopilot. once you're on a limited access road like a freeway, it navigates from onramp to offramp taking exits and changing lanes to pass (and gets out of the passing lane)
[22:48:27] <ggreer> also it has some basic lanekeeping features on surface streets and it obeys traffic lights

[22:49:34] <ggreer> tesla has slowly been rolling out a beta of FSD to those who purchased it. whether you get it or not is based on how safely you drive and how chaotic the traffic is around you
[22:50:34] <ggreer> I love to play around with my car. there's no point in buying the fastest model 3 if you're not going to *use* all that power
[22:51:26] <ggreer> so my safety score is too low to get the FSD beta. it's surprisingly close though. according to tesla, I'm a safer driver than the average tesla owner. that's kind of scary
[22:52:00] <ggreer> adiabatic: 20% increase in 18 months? it's exceeding inflation
[22:52:14] <adiabatic> not if all you buy is ground beef at the grocery store
[22:52:27] <adiabatic> ok, that's _slightly_ outpacing ground-beef inflation
[22:52:29] <ggreer> heh
[22:53:21] <adiabatic> kuudes: one of the things I've thought about in the shift to dealing with COVID is that bubbling up everyone **might** be a bad idea because lockdowns, etc. impose costs that are higher than letting the old and/or otherwise at-risk people get exposed to more COVID particles
[22:54:15] <adiabatic> now, I personally benefit from a more-paranoid style because I'm around old, at-risk useful people 
[22:54:28] <adiabatic> but this might not be the best for the rest of society
[22:55:12] <spxtr> I am basically never around old, at-risk people, however I don't know if the people I interact with are or are not.

[23:15:18] <saturn2> kuudes: what other covid strategy were you expecting at this point?
[23:16:31] <kuudes> I don't know, but iirc that has been proposed at about all the time
[23:16:59] <kuudes> so I guess my alternative is to continue as is; make better vaccines, make air conditioning better; lockdown when surge, then things return back better and open up
[23:17:35] <spxtr> so, more years of lockdown?
[23:17:43] <kuudes> tell people accurate data on how covid weather is, so that they can themselves make informed decisions
[23:18:14] <kuudes> its been 2 years so I expect it to continue  2 more years...
[23:18:22] <pompolic> at the beginning of the pandemic i predicted lockdowns will go from "extraordinary measure" to "policy lever" e_e
[23:19:06] <kuudes> over here they (the health institute and city media) have tried for instance to remove observations of covid cases from media
[23:19:20] <pompolic> this says nothing about their effectiveness or lack thereof because i honestly do not know
[23:19:23] <pompolic> but still feels bad man
[23:19:45] <kuudes> Helsingin Sanomat even made the infamous "the pandemic ends when we stop fearing" op ed in september 2021
[23:20:33] <saturn2> eternal lockdown seems insane to me
[23:20:36] <kuudes> I wonder how much of these changes come from usgov changing from red to blue
[23:20:56] <kuudes> we have not been in an actual curfew so far
[23:21:05] <pompolic> lucky you
[23:21:28] <kuudes> there are other options than curfew and no measures
[23:21:41] <kuudes> currently I see a push to no measures evermore
[23:21:57] <kuudes> like, look at uk
[23:22:01] <adiabatic> >usgov changing from red to blue
[23:22:02] <adiabatic> kek
[23:22:25] <kuudes> well, yes, this writer I point to was one of the main blue doctors who said trumps opening policies were evil
[23:22:33] <kuudes> but presumably biden's opening policies would be good
[23:22:48] <adiabatic> that's just Orange Man Bad
[23:23:38] <kuudes> personally I would see it sane to continue with current system; vaccinate people, get better vaccines
[23:24:17] <kuudes> even with just current vaccines, lets let israel to check if 4th dose is good (we about know it is safe) and if it is, then same for 5th, 6th
[23:24:48] <kuudes> without any new tech it seems possible 6 doses of pfizer would stop infections of even omicron
[23:25:19] <kuudes> if it does, then we can consider if over this side of atlantic we can actually just force vaccinate people
[23:25:25] <spxtr> I don't believe that more doses will do anything, especially wrt variants.
[23:25:39] <kuudes> third dose improved 6x from 2 doses
[23:25:49] <kuudes> which is why there is the booster drive in uk etc
[23:26:06] <kuudes> and not just replenish, 6x above the starting level of 2 doses
[23:26:06] <saturn2> there's the red to blue thing, but it's also become more obvious over time that we've failed and it's time to admit defeat
[23:26:22] <spxtr> I was under the impression the booster was mostly because there had been enough time passed since the first doses that they were wearing off.
[23:26:34] <kuudes> not just that. it improves the protection by much
[23:26:44] <kuudes> booster already would have stopped delta from spreading
[23:26:56] <kuudes> ie the vaccine induced herd immunity, stop of local spread
[23:27:07] <kuudes> 2 wasn't enough re delta for that, 3 was
[23:27:17] <kuudes> -> israel did that
[23:27:33] <kuudes> saturn2, have you? in russia 150% of population likely has got infected
[23:27:35] <kuudes> in usa way less
[23:28:09] <kuudes> just because usa may be less legible than smaller countries does not mean it has really failed on global scale
[23:28:31] <kuudes> ie there is a lot of space down from you if you let go of the ledge
[23:28:51] <kuudes> did you guys have to use army to bury people?
[23:30:01] <kuudes> some places did
[23:30:40] <saturn2> most people here seem to be ignoring covid and not wearing masks
[23:31:15] <spxtr> depends on where you are. here in the bay area people are paranoid, in sf they still wear masks outdoors

[23:31:51] <spxtr> in more reasonable places people mostly ignore masking

[23:32:16] <saturn2> unless sf can close its borders, that won't accomplish much
[23:32:30] <pompolic> i noticed other people are not really wearing masks outdoors
[23:32:40] <pompolic> and i was thinking, why am i still doing that
[23:32:46] <pompolic> and i realized i simply like hiding my face
[23:33:06] <phill> honestly once molnupivir and other treatments get in mass production, we won't need to lock down
[23:33:13] <adiabatic> tell me you don't have a Face ID phone without telling me you don't have a Face ID phone
[23:33:48] <adiabatic> there's a local hiking park that had big scary signs that say you need to wear a mask outside

[23:38:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> yes
[23:38:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, I don't really visit friends nowadays
[23:38:33] <spxtr> sounds pretty depressing
[23:38:57] <Obormot\Gaia> Last year when it looked like the pandemic might be winding down, we had a little get-together at a friend's house
[23:39:07] <Obormot\Gaia> Obviously everyone was vaccinated at that point, etc.
[23:39:50] <Obormot\Gaia> And THEN several of the people there got covid, including the friend who was hosting it (he had to get the monoclonal treatment or w/e, even)
[23:40:00] <spxtr> if that amount of socialization is fine with you then that's fine, but I would absolutely hate it
[23:40:00] <Obormot\Gaia> So, not doing that again, obviously
[23:40:10] <Obormot\Gaia> Well, let me put it this way
[23:40:24] <Obormot\Gaia> I could socialize only remotely
[23:40:25] <Obormot\Gaia> OR
[23:40:29] <Obormot\Gaia> I could risk my friends dying
[23:40:36] <Betawolf> lol
[23:40:37] <Obormot\Gaia> Not a tough choice
[23:40:40] <spxtr> are they old/at risk?
[23:40:43] <adiabatic> I see friends one at a time these days
[23:40:55] <adiabatic> MAYBE two at a time
[23:40:58] <Obormot\Gaia> spxtr: See above re: what happened last time
[23:41:34] <spxtr> so, no?
[23:41:37] <Obormot\Gaia> Yes some of them are "at risk", but it's not even necessary to think in such "official" categories - only to observe events
[23:41:45] <Obormot\Gaia> What do you mean "so, no"
[23:42:13] <adiabatic> spxtr: if you need to get monoclonal antibodies you're not having a good time
[23:42:17] <Obormot\Gaia> ^
[23:42:33] <spxtr> iirc in florida they give that to many people
[23:42:39] <Obormot\Gaia> This ain't Florida
[23:43:06] <Obormot\Gaia> Bottom line, we tried socializing and several fully vaccinated people got sick, one quite seriously (he is ok now thankfully)
[23:43:12] <Obormot\Gaia> (Well, as ok as I am, anyway)
[23:43:13] <spxtr> okay, so you have one anecdote
[23:43:33] <Obormot\Gaia> How many anecdotes do you think I need to make a decision here
[23:43:54] <spxtr> I've been doing 5-10 person gatherings once or twice a week for about a year now
[23:44:08] <spxtr> no issues
[23:44:15] <Obormot\Gaia> Observing the things I've observed and then going "it's perfectly safe, masks off and party" would be willful blindness of an extreme order
[23:44:39] <kuudes> in current surge I recommend wearing a ffp also outside
[23:44:51] <kuudes> and also recommend not meeting any persons currently preferrably
[23:44:59] <Betawolf> madness
[23:45:02] <spxtr> I'm not suggesting going to the huge parties that I see in college towns when I drive through
[23:45:18] <spxtr> obviously avoid superspreader events
[23:45:20] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: "ffp"?
[23:45:28] <kuudes> we have contact tracing that showed an infection in outdoor political advertising encounter where both persons were fully vaxxed and masked
[23:45:37] <adiabatic> Obormot\Gaia: FFP2 = Euro N95. FFP3 = Euro N100.
[23:45:38] <kuudes> in us terms it is n-masks
[23:45:43] <kuudes> what adiabatic said
[23:45:51] <Obormot\Gaia> kuudes: oh ok. Yeah I do that
[23:45:55] <kuudes> indeed
[23:46:06] <adiabatic> N95s outside here in the suburbs is madness.
[23:46:22] <kuudes> if there actually are no persons, then of course there is no requirement
[23:46:27] <Obormot\Gaia> Well, this ain't the suburbs either :p
[23:46:33] <kuudes> but here in my suburb I notice people walk in bikeways etc
[23:46:53] <phill> im pretty sure most monoclonal antibodies don't work against delta
[23:46:53] <kuudes> and indeed currently I presume omicron could/would infect you if another person hiked by you
[23:46:59] <phill> omicron*
[23:47:08] <kuudes> because it just is that much more infective.
[23:47:10] <phill> i think there's one brand that does
[23:47:21] <adiabatic> what phill said
[23:47:27] <spxtr> Obormot\Gaia: I see your argument as basically the same as the antivaxxers who say "I know someone who got vaccinated and then caught covid so all vaccines are bad"
[23:47:41] <spxtr> You know someone vaccinated who had a bad time with covid.
[23:47:42] <Obormot\Gaia> spxtr: That's dumb and you know it
[23:47:44] <kuudes> no, masks and vaccines are extremely good
[23:47:49] <kuudes> omicron just is worse
[23:47:55] <Obormot\Gaia> phill: This was pre-Omicron, to be clear
[23:48:07] <kuudes> in nyc there are a lot of people also
[23:48:16] <Obormot\Gaia> Also just for reference, my neighborhood has a population density of 20k/km^2
[23:48:42] <kuudes> it seemed possible to me from data that at times of past waves there were times in nyc where the ambient air just had enough virus particles to infect you
[23:48:46] <kuudes> even pre-omicron
[23:48:52] <kuudes> because so many people infected
[23:49:05] <kuudes> and there is so many people in nyc
[23:49:07] <phill> https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03829-0 ~ looks like there are two monoclonal antibodies that work, but one is going under trials
[23:49:08] <Robomot> Omicron overpowers key COVID antibody treatments in early tests (Nearly all of the monoclonal antibodies used to prevent severe disease fail to stand up to the new variant, laboratory assays show.)
[23:49:33] <Obormot\Gaia> spxtr: Note that if you modify your hypothetical antivaxxer's argument to "I know someone who got vaccinated and then caught covid, so vaccines don't actually prevent you from getting covid", *then it becomes correct*
[23:49:48] <Obormot\Gaia> Of course it doesn't become *a reason not to vaccinate*, but that's a different matter!
[23:49:48] <kuudes> lab leak narrative says most of those antibody thingies were experimented with the animal that produced omicron :-)
[23:50:02] <spxtr> (not a hypothetical antivaxxer, that's literally my sister's mother in law and she's an idiot)
[23:50:09] <Obormot\Gaia> My condolences
[23:50:15] <kuudes> we know for sure that 3 doses does not prevent you from getting omicron, even often
[23:50:37] <phill> i think it's like 70% effective on that front though?
[23:50:47] <kuudes> ie there are multiple notes of very experienced people who have been all 3 dosed and had a doctor meeting and then noticed they all (or half of them) got infected
[23:51:16] <kuudes> yeah, it is good. unsure what is the percentage, depends also on the time from last dose
[23:52:08] <spxtr> Obormot\Gaia: "I know someone who had a bad time with covid after a party, so parties can spread covid" is also correct. But it's also not a good reason to not have a party.
[23:52:20] <kuudes> what
[23:52:22] <Obormot\Gaia> ... of course it's a good reason not to have a party
[23:52:25] <Obormot\Gaia> Are you kidding?
[23:52:36] <Obormot\Gaia> It's an excellent reason! The best reason!
[23:52:52] <Obormot\Gaia> What possible reason could you have for *not* avoiding parties, given that
[23:53:21] <spxtr> P(bad outcome | party) * (badness of outcome) < P(no bad outcome | party) * (goodness of party)
[23:53:39] <Obormot\Gaia> Don't be ridiculous
[23:53:54] <Obormot\Gaia> "goodness of party" would have to be astronomical for that to even potentially be the case
[23:53:59] <Betawolf> lol
[23:54:03] <Obormot\Gaia> This party would need to, like, single-handedly cure cancer

[23:54:37] <spxtr> not really? all of my friends are young, healthy, boosted, tested weekly, and know not to socialize if feeling any sickness
[23:54:50] <spxtr> so P(bad outcome | party) is very, very low (pre-omicron)
[23:54:54] <kuudes> asymptomatic spread
[23:55:01] <Obormot\Gaia> Wrong, it was quite high
[23:55:09] <Obormot\Gaia> (And is *very* high now)
[23:55:22] <spxtr> just getting sick isn't a bad outcome
[23:55:39] <spxtr> (although until omicron none of us did)
[23:55:42] <kuudes> depends on local prevalence. when prevalence is low, ie there is few illness going around, then it is less risky and you can do more
[23:56:00] <kuudes> ie over here during summers we have got to less than 10/100k cases in 14 day periods
[23:56:02] <Obormot\Gaia> spxtr: You are saying some crazy things man
[23:56:11] <Obormot\Gaia> *Of course* getting sick is a bad outcome
[23:56:14] <phill> what's a bad outcome then?
[23:56:48] <spxtr> I mean, we accept that people spread flu, colds, etc at parties
[23:56:50] <spxtr> that's baseline
[23:56:59] <Obormot\Gaia> What? No we don't
[23:57:08] <Obormot\Gaia> We absolutely do not accept this
[23:57:18] <phill> (getting sick from the flu is also a bad outcome in most peoples' minds)
[23:57:30] <Obormot\Gaia> If you have the flu or a cold, you damn well better stay home and don't come to a party! That's understood! Among all decent people!
[23:57:46] <spxtr> I agree, but you can still spread the disease shortly before becoming symptomatic
[23:58:00] <spxtr> when interacting in public there is a baseline chance of getting a cold, mostly
[23:58:03] <spxtr> flu is more rare
[23:58:05] <Obormot\Gaia> With the flu or a cold it's much less likely...
[23:58:09] <kuudes> I have stayed at home from parties I have wanted to go when I noticed I got ill before covid times
[23:58:09] <superz> Could you guys provide numbers in your reasoning, and how you derived those numbers (intuition, some paper, etc) for this P(bad outcome | party) * (badness of outcome) < P(no bad outcome | party) * (goodness of party)
[23:58:17] <Obormot\Gaia> Same, of course
[23:58:26] <spxtr> I do as well
[23:58:31] <Obormot\Gaia> What kind of inconsiderate person would come to a party if they had some airborne-transmissible infection?!
[23:58:32] <superz> Or in Obormots case: P(bad outcome | party) * (badness of outcome) > P(no bad outcome | party) * (goodness of party)
[23:58:34] <Obormot\Gaia> It boggles the mind
[23:58:51] <phill> well what's considered a bad outcome?
[23:58:54] <phill> that's the first thing
[23:59:02] <Obormot\Gaia> Getting covid is a bad outcome!
[23:59:07] <kuudes> before covid the party line was that there was no airborne infections though, because because
[23:59:14] <spxtr> I (probably) just had it, and it was basically a mild cold
[23:59:24] <spxtr> annoying for sure, but I've had many colds before
[23:59:34] <spxtr> I'm not going to shut down my life for years over a mild cold
[23:59:38] <Obormot\Gaia> You were very lucky, but in general, covid is nothing like "a mild cold"
[23:59:49] <phill> and what do you mean by probably?
