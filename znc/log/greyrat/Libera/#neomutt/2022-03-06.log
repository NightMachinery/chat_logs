[18:54:39] <oriba> CID 249009 seems to be false positive
[18:55:10] <oriba> but there are some hardcoded values in the function log_translation() ...

[18:57:32] <flatcap> ah yes
[19:02:31] <oriba> the 9 can be drived from "Language:", but that value is hardcoded itself; and the 64 comes from nowhere
[19:03:55] <flatcap> the 64 is used in the mutt_debug() to truncate the string
[19:04:17] *** Quits: sss1 (~sss1@46.148.180.137) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[19:04:18] <oriba> is there no definition that it is 64?
[19:04:45] <oriba> DEFAULT_LOG_STRINGLENGTH or such a thing
[19:04:46] <flatcap> no.  it's just a number to keep the log message from being long
[19:05:02] <flatcap> the log _should_ be able to cope with any length...
[19:05:20] <flatcap> but if _that_ string is >64 then something's gone wrong with out translation
[19:05:23] <flatcap> our*
[19:05:42] * flatcap checks the coverity build settings
[19:05:50] <oriba> but then an errmsg would make sense?
[19:06:35] <flatcap> hmm... I'm not sure we care
[19:06:36] <oriba> if len > 64 then write_log("Our langugae translation is buggy")
[19:06:40] *** Joins: sss1 (~sss1@46.148.180.137)
[19:07:16] <flatcap> we're trying to do something smart: extract the translation code, e.g. de_DE from some free form text in the translation file
[19:08:02] <flatcap> ah!  the coverity build includes `--disable-nls` which is disabling _()/gettext()
[19:08:12] <oriba> with " " leading and "\n" at the end
[19:08:27] <flatcap> yes
[19:08:42] <flatcap> have a look at po/de.po
[19:09:14] <flatcap> gettext() turns a msgid string into the msgstr string
[19:09:32] <flatcap> if we pass "" to gettext() then it returns the first block of text in the .po
[19:11:15] <oriba> po/de.po -> "Language: de\n"
[19:11:25] <oriba> "Language:" will be ignored
[19:11:42] <oriba> so we get  " de\n"
[19:12:00] <flatcap> yep, SKIPWS() skips the leading whitespace
[19:12:08] <oriba> ah ok
[19:12:21] * flatcap sets coverity rebuilding: https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/actions/runs/1941596383
[19:13:01] <flatcap> I've enabled nls, so that L446 isn't a noop.  header = _(header);
[19:13:31] <oriba> when the code is not changed, it should work savely, but in general I dislike hard coded values. A strlen(header_start) with header_start = "Language:" would be nicer, imho
[19:13:50] <flatcap> agreed
[19:14:23] <flatcap> let's just see if coverity is happier when it knows about gettext()
[19:14:34] <flatcap> if not, you can go to town on the function :-)
[19:15:57] <oriba> even if  coverity is happy then, the hard coded values will be there...
[19:16:11] <flatcap> yes
[19:16:20] <flatcap> build done: coverity working: https://scan.coverity.com/projects/neomutt-neomutt?tab=overview
[19:16:55] <oriba> ok, I try being patient.... making a coffee...
[19:20:35] <flatcap> defect eliminated :-)
[19:20:48] <oriba> :-)
[19:20:54] <oriba> "configured away"
[19:21:08] <flatcap> sort of
[19:22:25] <oriba> like this one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkers_(horse_tack)#/media/File:Horses_2.jpg
[19:22:38] <oriba> ;-)
[19:23:09] <flatcap> yep :-)
[19:24:21] <oriba> and now... changing the function anyway?
[19:26:18] <flatcap> if you want to
[19:27:08] <oriba> ok

[19:27:52] <oriba> can the "Language:" be derived from somewhere where it is fix enough to use it (or adding a define somewhere?)

[19:30:29] <flatcap> not from anywhere in the code.  there's probably some standard somewhere
[19:31:25] <flatcap> all the .po files have that exact header
[19:31:57] <oriba> could use local const

[19:33:50] <oriba> is 'label' the correct name for what is skipped? ("Language:")
[19:34:17] <flatcap> yes, that sounds good
[19:34:55] <oriba> ok. then I will use that, if 'lookup' is not better
[19:36:04] <flatcap> label sounds better to me

[19:47:03] * flatcap looks ...
[19:47:31] <oriba> maybe checking he len can also be added (len as maxlen); not looked at what will happen with len = (nl - lang);  just did not changed the len-thingy
[19:48:22] <flatcap> it's probably not worth over-engineering it
[19:48:49] <oriba> ok

[20:15:48] <oriba> CID 220625: looks like false positive too. But when only looking at mailbox_gc_add(), the issue makes sense.
[20:16:04] <oriba> but after mailbox_gc_run() has been run, gc.idx is 0

[20:18:54] <oriba> if not changing the code, at least a comment moght be added behind the call to mailbox_gc_run()
[20:20:13] <oriba> don't know if coverity re-configuration allows someting like "look deeper" so that it looks at mailbox_gc_run() too.
[20:20:41] <oriba> or would inlining help here?

[21:10:54] <alec> so is `abook` the primary way to make mutt smart about my contacts & their email addresses?

[21:13:44] <alec> zsw: oh yeah, goobook sounds familiar
[21:13:45] <zsw> set query_command = "goobook query '%s' 2>/dev/null"
[21:14:13] <alec> that's your config? is there more to it than that?
[21:33:42] <zsw> I have the ~/.goobookrc
[21:34:09] <zsw> it has email: password: , and 'filter_groupless_contacts: no' on separate lines
[21:37:36] <flatcap> oriba: I'll have a think later
[21:37:50] <alec> zsw: oh look... https://gitlab.com/goobook/goobook says it's to access your Google contacts... fortunately I just stopped using google :)
[21:38:16] <flatcap> Xylon: yes, you can map anything to anything.  by default NeoMutt installs a vim-keys.rc

[22:58:06] <elshize> hi yall, I'm having weird issues with notmuch: I checked the logs, and when I search for messages with vfolder-from-query, the logs show that it tries to append messages but they fail to parse, so literally no messages are shown. but they work just with `notmuch show` or with alot. also, they used to work just fine. any idea what might be wrong?
[23:12:43] <oriba> flatcap, I think I have found a nasty thing, when exploring coverity's CID 215476.
