[06:17:26] <JackFrost> As for Ukraine, yeah there's some 100K troops, tanks, artillery, and armored trucks on the border.

[09:43:20] <zro> I'm arguing with a friend. I say "you should use full disk encryption". They refuse. Instead, they asymmetrically encrypt (gpg) documents to themselves, decrypt them to work on them, then re-encrypt them to their own public key. I contend that this is a horrible and absurd practice. This is not the way to encrypt data at rest. My main arguments thus far have been about metadata leakage,
[09:43:23] <zro> unaccounted for temporary files, and narrowly focusing on the confidentiality of the documents while ignoring the integrity of the rest of the system. What else am I missing or am I wrong? I swear theres a higher level argument about asymmetric vs symmetric, but I'm not sure I'm articulating it correctly.

[09:56:06] <zro> ajak: yes. thats my point about ignoring the integrity of the system
[09:56:32] <zro> re: the private key. gpg does store the private key encrypted, so its not as though its just chillin there
[09:56:43] <zro> OK, lets say they did finally encrypt their disk. And then they wanted the 'added protection' of an 'extra layer of security' for certain documents. ie. They want to boot their system and allow someone to use it, but not have access to their private documents. I would still encourage them to do something like use an encrypted disk image they could mount and unmount for their "private area" rather
[09:56:46] <zro> than this bizarre asymmetric practice. Am I being overly formalistic or weird about it? To me asymmetric exists for situations where two parties cannot share a secret, and everything else seems a weird abuse even though I can't really articulate concrete deficiency except maybe unnecessary resource usage.

[09:57:21] <ajak> why would you encrypt certain things at rest on a medium that is already encrypted at rest?
[09:58:43] <ghostbuster> also asymmetric encryption is much slower than symmetric.. especially considering lots of computers have hardware AES but AFAIK none have hardware RSA

[10:00:01] <Hydragyrum> personally for file-level encryption I use gpg symmetric encryption and emacs just supports it (I enter passphrase opening the file, and it prompts how I want to encrypt it when writing to a .gpg)
[10:00:35] <zro> right, I would use sym as well. cuz it just "feels" right. but thats a weird argument.
[10:01:28] <zro> i guess asym is technically vulnerable to shors algorithm attack where sym is not maybe? or do I have that wrong? also, it seems pretty esoteric.
[10:01:37] <ghostbuster> it feels right because you're using a tool that was made to solve a specific problem to solve that problem, and not trying to use a screwdriver to hammer a nail
[10:02:11] <Hydragyrum> which isn't a complete solution, but works well in the context I use it (file-level encryption is for files that may leave my system, i.e. getting backed up to remote storage or included in something getting synced to unencrypted remote, etc.)
[10:03:51] <ajak> but why would you encrypt certain things at rest on a medium that is already encrypted at rest?

[19:49:54] <ve1vet>  Hi, I wonder how they flash Stock ROM, in a locked device, cases like , forgot PIN or PASSWORD? USB debugging is not enabled. So adb is useless! And also unlocking bootloader in some devices like Xioami requires an account in device and some procedure. I tried Googling Nothing came up. How do they do it?
[19:52:14] <B4ckBOne> ve1vet, they dont.
[19:52:37] <B4ckBOne> Truth is that things like that happen and the soltuion is to flash new devices.
[19:53:26] <B4ckBOne> Other vendors have debug access authentication set up. With different access levels for Chip Manufacturer. Electronic Manufacturing service. Vendor and sometimes even customer ;-)
[19:53:43] *** Joins: hololeap (~hololeap@user/hololeap)
[19:54:51] <ve1vet> Ok, Vendors set some sort of authentication for this type of incident right?
[19:55:16] <B4ckBOne> You cant generalize this.
[19:55:36] <B4ckBOne> Different vendors have different products that can be configured in different ways.

[19:59:03] <tomreyn> not produce it in the first place
[19:59:56] <ve1vet> Yes, There would be some implementation. But as fas as googled nothing came up. But when we accidently locked device they could retrive it!

[23:36:59] <horseface> i do mention it and the absurdity of the current state of prohibition of substances which enable us to develop our selves, our souls
[23:37:00] <horseface> et
[23:37:01] <horseface> c
[23:37:08] <horseface> but hardly...
[23:37:13] <horseface> it touches on EVERYTHING.
[23:37:13] <ghostbuster> did etc really need to be two lines?
[23:37:18] <horseface> sorry
[23:37:23] <horseface> i missed the c haha.
[23:37:39] <horseface> it was NOT intentional.

[23:39:04] <ghostbuster> it's not a contest to have the most lines of everyone's buffer filled with your nick
[23:39:06] <Deknos> sounds like senseless rambling
[23:39:16] <horseface> haha wow.
[23:39:28] <horseface> i can tell that you've not read a line of it.
[23:39:42] <ghostbuster> smiley face and heart emoji each needed their own line eh

[23:40:10] <horseface> just read that...
[23:40:18] <horseface> and tell me it is "senseless rambling".
[23:40:19] <Deknos> i just read the first paragraph and it IS senseless rambling
[23:40:20] <horseface> i mean-
[23:40:34] <horseface> clearly there is a language barrier then.
[23:40:43] <Deknos> no, there is not.
[23:40:43] <horseface> i speak english.
[23:40:48] <horseface> yes, there is.

[23:41:17] <Deknos> no, you just think you are smarter and think more about stuff than everyone else. probably because of substance abuse and/or psychological problems.
[23:41:29] <horseface> yes, ofc...
[23:41:33] <horseface> i KNEW it.
[23:41:38] <horseface> had you not have known i used meth.
[23:41:46] <horseface> you wouldn't have formed this opinion.
[23:41:49] <Deknos> i would definitely have suspected it
[23:41:50] <horseface> you poor soul.
[23:41:57] <horseface> no not at all...
[23:42:01] <Deknos> i have an old friend who does other stuff (medication abuse)
[23:42:05] <Deknos> he writes similar stuff
[23:42:19] <Deknos> thinks every unusual car is the car of a spy agency
[23:42:23] <horseface> i wish you happiness and a pure perception in your life.
[23:42:25] <horseface> <3
[23:42:28] <Deknos> and also writes pamphlets about "philosophy"
[23:42:38] <horseface> i have to run... it's time for me to head to the laboratory.

[23:43:50] <ghostbuster> is that code for smoking meth lol

[23:44:31] <ilikeyou> all this drug talk has me peer pressured. i have the long weekend, so.. hook a brother up
[23:45:47] <horseface> i am still here, and no. i do NOT "smoke" meth, more correctly it is vaporising it... i only shoot it. i do not know a single person that has managed to maintain their sanity that "smokes" it.
[23:45:52] <horseface> i am just finishing my cigarette...
[23:46:16] <horseface> soon i will have to bid my farewell...
[23:46:17] <horseface> :-)
[23:46:33] <mats1> we'll remember you fondly
[23:46:41] <horseface> and no, i am heading to the university where i undertake my research...
[23:46:51] <horseface> mats1, i have no idea what the fuck you're on about...
[23:47:10] <horseface> meth increases life expectancy by twenty fucking percent.
[23:47:28] <horseface> clearly you're a victim of the government promulgated negative propaganda.

[23:48:16] <horseface> i feel sorry for you but i have faith in you and believe that one day you will see and realise and understand the truth of the nature of matters in a manner which is congruent in in concord to reality and nature.
[23:48:27] <horseface> i've been using meth for nine years, man.
[23:48:41] <horseface> i can only be assured of the certainty of the changes i have noticed within myself.
[23:48:55] <horseface> and i have improved DRAMATICALLY.
[23:48:55] <mats1> perhaps you are the erdos we need
[23:49:03] <horseface> cognitively and physiologically.
[23:49:07] <horseface> haha
[23:49:12] <horseface> i love erdos...
[23:49:13] <horseface> :-)
[23:49:17] <Deknos> you have to be a shitty physicist if you did not do a control group and extern control element which is not you
[23:49:29] <horseface> huh?
[23:49:55] <horseface> i am researching a principle which is of the classical context although it is adaptable to quantum concepts...
[23:49:56] *** Quits: skapata (~Skapata@user/skapata) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:50:49] <horseface> it is of a relationship discovered by issac newton which describes an inverse relationship between a particles perceived influence of time and its kinetic energy, or velocity.

[23:51:03] <Deknos> lol
[23:51:17] <mats1> whats meth cost in aus?
[23:51:20] <horseface> but exploiting this dynamic i plan to develop the theory for a device which will permit our very real viable departure into the cosmos.

[23:51:34] <ghostbuster> is it some physical tic in your hand that makes you press the enter key before you're done typing?

[23:52:15] <horseface> this device will be capable of taking us wherever we wish to go by manipulating our perceived state of time to provide the impression of travelling a VAST distance though over only a very minute period of time.
[23:52:43] <horseface> thus it is guided travel and not teleportation which is more appropriately qualified as a form of resonance.
[23:52:49] <horseface> and meth in australia is quite dear...

[23:53:18] <mats1> how many hits is that?
[23:53:24] <horseface> here in surfer's paradise i am paying between $70-$100 for a 100mg.
[23:53:25] <horseface> :-/
[23:53:52] <horseface> but... i started nine years ago on a 100mg injection (IV) and it lasted me for a duration of thirty hours...

[23:59:34] <horseface> it is not yet ready for publication in a journal.
[23:59:39] <ghostbuster> err sorry quantum research
[23:59:40] <horseface> i got caught up.
[23:59:42] <horseface> and no.
[23:59:46] <horseface> i SHOOT it.
