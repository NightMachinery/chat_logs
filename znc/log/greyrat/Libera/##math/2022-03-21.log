[03:21:22] <Fangs> there's so much more you can say about symmetric polynomials compared to general groups I think

[03:22:17] <isekaijin> Oh.
[03:22:48] <Fangs> isekaijin: there's just those weird identities on polynomial decomposition that comes from various decomposition of rep of S_n as reps of S_{n-1} (or vice versa)

[03:24:28] <Fangs> if you see my link there, heres how to rephrase it: let c_j be the j-th elementary symmetric polynomial (in n variable) and let D_n (d/dx_1 + ... + d/dx_n), then D_n(c_j) = (n-j+1)c_{j-1}
[03:24:54] <Fangs> I'm getting sidetracked..
[03:25:09] <isekaijin> D_n = d/dx_1 + ... + d/dx_n?
[03:25:19] <Fangs> sum of partial derivatives
[03:25:19] <Fangs> yeah
[03:25:30] <Fangs> I missed the equality there
[03:25:32] <isekaijin> Oh, okay.
[03:25:46] <Fangs> isekaijin: I was going to ask if you'd know of any obvious maps between rings of symmetric polynomials.. I don't really know
[03:26:19] <isekaijin> Mmm... (S_n)-equivariant maps?
[03:27:04] <Fangs> isekaijin: the funny thing is, you can identify H*(BU(n)) with the ring of symmetric polynomials and maps between BU(n) -> BU(m) will give ring homs  H*(BU(m))  -> H*(BU(n))
[03:27:21] <isekaijin> Ooooh.
[03:27:23] <Fangs> I haven't thought about it much.. idk if this is going to be G-equivariant.. G = S_n.. I hate typing out underscore
[03:28:16] <Fangs> isekaijin: there's also weird things you can do.. like BU(n) -> BU(2n), induced on the level of matrices by mapping M -> [M 0; 0 M] etc
[03:28:34] <isekaijin> Wait, if I recall correctly, H*(BU(n)) is just Z[c1,...,cn], where cj has degree j, right?

[08:18:20] <greenbagels> the k=1 polynomial is symmetric about the middle -1, yeah
[08:18:23] <greenbagels> are all of them like that?
[08:19:02] <somiaj> It seems so, so number 4 is a 14th degree poly, but they only list (1,0,-1,0,0,0,0,-1) down to the 7th degree term, so use symmetry
[08:19:11] <greenbagels> all the 10th degrees seem to only list 6 coefficients; all the 14th degree ones list 8...
[08:19:33] <somiaj> x^14 - x^12 - x^6 - x^6 - x^2 + 1
[08:19:45] <somiaj> arg that should be x^7 - x^6 -- typo
[08:20:32] <greenbagels> maroon: i would submit feedback asking them to clarify the symmetry
[08:20:48] <greenbagels> saying <X> is shorthand for <Y> without describing the symmetry is bad form, imo
[08:21:18] <maroon> i'm having trouble being dyslexic for the lower half, i'm trying to fill in the blanks to see if i get the same fraction
[08:23:11] <somiaj> well what do you expect from a bunch of witches, it has to be in code...(:
[08:24:13] <maroon> looks like it should be symmetric. 3 & 4 are the poly's not listed at oeis, and filling in the mirror poly's works for the expected number, thanks
[08:24:45] <greenbagels> sure

[09:36:49] <PlanckWalk> Inst: In some convoluted concept of "reduce", probably
[09:37:11] <PlanckWalk> I mean logically they're equivalent since both are provable.
[09:37:39] <PlanckWalk> So in particular you can prove that "no planar complete 5-graph implies 4-colour theorem"
[09:38:09] <PlanckWalk> But you can just as well prove "2+2=4 implies 4-colour theorem"
[09:39:08] <Inst> PlanckWalk: you can reduce any 4 regions in a colored map into a planar complete 4 graph
[09:39:49] <Inst> actually, that's the difficult part of it
[09:40:45] <Inst> it's easy to prove that an additional unit cannot be planar complete with the existing 4 regions
[09:41:01] <Inst> then you have the basics of a proof by induction
[09:41:14] <Inst> if 5 units cannot be planar complete, then prove that 6 units
[09:41:29] <Inst> the last time I showed this off, the challenge was action at a distance
[09:41:44] <PlanckWalk> I'm pretty sure that the hard part is ... yes, the implications for more distant regions.
[09:42:01] <PlanckWalk> That's where the thousands of computer-checked cases came in.
[09:43:02] <Inst> i'm still thinking it's possible to expand based on no planar complete 5 graph
[09:43:49] <Inst> wait, is it an unsolved problem for planar complete 5 graph?
[09:43:52] <Inst> erm, 6 graph?
[09:44:14] <PlanckWalk> I don't know what you mean.  My straightfowrad interpretation is trivial.
[09:44:38] <PlanckWalk> Since a planar complete 6 node graph would have a planar complete 5 node graph as a subgraph.
[09:44:39] <Inst> i mean the basis of no planar complete 5 graph -> 4 color theorem, it's a very simple and elegant solution to 4 color theorem
[09:45:10] <PlanckWalk> And so the nonexistence of planar complete 5 node graphs rules it out immediately.
[09:45:42] <Inst> it's just hard to go from no planar complete 5 graph to 4 color theorem
[09:46:10] <PlanckWalk> Well yes, ther reverse implication is trivial.

[09:46:53] <Inst> 5 is easy to work with, tbh
[09:47:50] <Inst> the 5, if it's adjacent to 3 of the given regions, and you force a color onto the 5, it just determines what the interior color must be
[09:48:00] <Inst> the 5 is therefore equal to the interior color
[09:48:19] <PlanckWalk> What is "the 5"?
[09:48:54] <Inst> say we have 4 regions that are planar complete
[09:49:06] <Inst> a fifth region cannot be planar complete to the existing 4 regions
[09:49:10] <PlanckWalk> Correct
[09:49:22] <Inst> only coplanar to 3 of the regions, because one region must be interior
[09:49:33] <Inst> or, the fifth region is interior to the 4 regions,
[09:49:47] <Inst> which is equivalent to designating one of the existing four regions as the "5th"
[09:50:03] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that part is very easy to prove.
[09:50:32] <Inst> now let us say we use coplanar regions to force a specific color in the "5th"
[09:51:15] <Inst> that, ultimately, at best, can only force the interior region (which is not connected to the 5th) to have the same color as the 5th

[09:55:13] <Inst> https://imgur.com/a/Taa1s8I
[09:55:23] <Inst> the idea is that we have an abstracted relation of regions
[09:55:37] <Inst> that for all regions in a 2D map, can be reduced to the abstracted relation of regions
[09:55:44] <PlanckWalk> Sure
[09:56:02] <Inst> so for 6 regions
[09:56:30] <PlanckWalk> It's usually presented as planar graphs where the "regions" are just nodes, and easily reducible to planar triangulated graphs.
[09:56:34] <Inst> the 6th region can only be adjacent to two of the core regions, alongside the "5th"

[11:12:45] <greenbagels> also energizer when you helped me with my julia question i knew your name looked familiar, i just couldn't tell from which channel
[11:12:47] <greenbagels> :D
[11:13:05] <greenbagels> (now i know!)
[11:13:56] <PlanckWalk> energizer: Because there's always a solution in integers, the only question is whether there is a nonnegative solution.
[11:14:05] <PlanckWalk> And 77 is large enough that there always is.
[11:14:25] <PlanckWalk> If you have an integer solution for (m,n), then (m+11,n-7) is another solution.
[11:14:35] <PlanckWalk> (And likewise for swapped signs)
[11:15:04] <PlanckWalk> So if there is any solution, then there is one with 0 <= m < 11
[11:15:18] <PlanckWalk> And then you get n > 0
[11:17:12] <PlanckWalk> So for any w >= 77, with 7 m + 11 n = w and 0 <= m < 11, then 7 m < 77 and so n > 0.
[11:17:57] <PlanckWalk> That sorts out all w >= 77.
[11:18:17] <PlanckWalk> The next question is whether w=76 has a solution.

[19:36:40] <Z-module> I even suspect they wanted the target price to be 1000000 cents (10000 euros) so that 2^20 is only slightly above that, but they messed up.
[19:37:27] <Inst> is it possible to redefine the four color theorem as "it is not possible to place a node to a planar complete 4 plane such that it is connected to all 4 planes
[19:37:53] <biberao> Z-module: i think the wording is bad :D
[19:38:39] <Z-module> I agree.

[23:13:16] <ttys000> i am trying to calculate the effective radius of my dual monitor setup, I am trying to see what would be closest in a single curved monitor, but they market those monitors all with a radius value, like 1000R or 1800R, etc. where the curve is defined by a radius of 1000mm for example for the 1000R monitor.

[23:24:16] <zeroc00l0> ttys000: You might be able to just brute force it.  Start with r = 1, see if there is a point on it's circumference with those measurements, if not try r = 2, and so on.

[23:28:10] <zeroc00l0> joel135: How does that argument work?
[23:28:58] <joel135> [x0, y0] is the rightmost point where the horizontal line meets the circle
[23:29:07] <joel135> r is the radius of the circle
[23:29:22] *** Joins: foobaz212 (~foobaz212@152.37.103.80)
[23:29:28] <joel135> so x0^2 + y0^2 - r^2 since that point is to lie on the circle
[23:29:38] <joel135> 2*x0 - 47 was given
[23:29:52] <joel135> r - 10 - y0 was also given
[23:30:09] <joel135> all those things = 0, that is
[23:30:49] <joel135> the full basis that is then computed is [x0 - 47/2, y0 - 1809/80, r - 2609/80], but we only wanted r here so i just printed that one

[23:35:11] <joel135> but beware that if your current monitors go straight through [-x0, y0], [0, r], [x0, y0] then the angle at the points [+-x0, y0] in a new monitor would be twice as far from the angle at [0, r] as the current ones
[23:35:32] <zeroc00l0> The center of the circle is [0,0]?
