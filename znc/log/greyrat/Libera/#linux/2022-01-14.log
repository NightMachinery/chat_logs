[00:33:49] <tirnanog> ke4nhw: by the way, it can be made more efficient with the use of a GNU extension to the cp command, which would be: -exec cp -t bar {} +
[00:33:51] <akik> ke4nhw: you mean find's -print0 and xargs -0
[00:34:10] <ke4nhw> yes
[00:34:25] <blackgatonegro> So... Linux Mint is getting Firefox money...
[00:34:45] <uwharrie> ke4nhw: some people try to parse find's output or pass it directly to xargs instead of using -exec which is where the problems with spaces and newlines comes in
[00:34:45] <judah> And Firefox is getting Google money
[00:35:13] <ke4nhw> How would that make it more efficient?
[00:35:31] <blackgatonegro> That's all I can think of talking about cause Wine and video drivers updates are getting ridiculous, they never were so fast before.
[00:35:34] <jason1236> blackgatonegro: that's why I try to move to BSD, too much dirty money and dirty business behind linux. soon or later Mikrosoft will come that put more dirt.
[00:35:42] <tirnanog> ke4nhw: by having find convey more than one pathname at a time per invocation of cp.
[00:35:48] <tirnanog> forking overhead is real.
[00:35:51] <blackgatonegro> There is no clean Os
[00:36:07] <uwharrie> ke4nhw: `-exec cmd {} \;` executes `cmd <filename>` for every file found. `-exec cmd {} +` executes `cmd <filename1> <filename2> ... <filenameN>`

[02:59:30] <hajonnes> evilop, output form pacman -Qs nvidia https://termbin.com/djc8
[02:59:35] <phogg> I thought it was generally accepted that xfs is superior to ext4, but not so much better that it's a compelling reason to change.
[02:59:38] <evilop> for some tasks ext4 is significantly faster, specially with tweaking
[02:59:47] <evilop> in other ones xfs wins
[02:59:51] <uwharrie> My #1 criteria is: is it the distro default?
[02:59:53] <ananke> phogg: perhaps not change, but new deployments
[03:00:18] <phogg> ananke: I mean change as in "change my habit of typing mkfs.ext4"
[03:00:22] <gh555222> yes, if you had like a PLFS translation layer on a rotating hdd, which was expecting ext4-style i/o, then xfs could cause reduced performance
[03:00:35] <Common-Lisp> uwharrie: ah, well, my distro doesn't have a default
[03:00:58] <evilop> some of the biggest performance wins for ext4 comes when you adjust the defaults / enable additional features
[03:00:59] <ananke> xfs has plenty of other things that ext4 lacks, so if you want to steer away from your distro's defaults, you should evaluate your anticipated workload

[03:33:39] <puff> Evening.  A couple months ago I upgraded my laptop hard drive.  Before doing that, I used rsync to create backups.  I restored some stuff from the backup drive, now I'm looking at some old git repos and all the files are 755 instead of 644... it looks like they're the same perms on the backup drive.  I'm wondering what went wrong.
[03:34:05] <omegatron> different filesystems I would guess
[03:34:55] <puff> Ah, okay.

[03:36:58] <phogg> don't use Windows anywyere!
[03:37:04] <phogg> er, anywhere
[03:37:17] <puff> So now I'm trying to figure out how to proceed... I guess I'll use "git status" and see which files it complains about, pipe that into a file and massage it into a bulk shell script to chmod it.
[03:37:24] <phogg> or backup into a tarball and just put the tarball onto the FAT disk
[03:37:25] <omegatron> yeah, write a script which corrects the file permissions
[03:37:28] <puff> phogg: You're preaching to the choir.
[03:37:49] <puff> That's something I was wondering about the other day, are there better backup tools for linux?
[03:37:52] <phogg> puff: if you have the git data you can definitely restore the perms. Google will reveal the steps
[03:37:54] <omegatron> but yes, better approach is to tar your stuff and move that file to your backup disk
[03:38:00] <phogg> I've done something like this in a somewhat different scenario
[03:38:27] <puff> With rsync, I have to break it up into multiple stages, otherwise after 30k files the external drive starts giving errors and drops into read only mode.
[03:39:17] <puff> omegatron: That assumes I have enough free disk space to create a tar.gz of my entire disk...
[03:39:42] <uwharrie> better backup tools range from things like a simple tar.gz to something rsync based like rsnapshot or rdiff and on up to borg or duplicity
[03:40:05] <omegatron> I wouldn't tar an entire disk usually at once, but break it down to some few archives - but yes, it assumes such things
[03:40:23] <uwharrie> you shouldn't need to back up your entire disk, just your data and config files. the rest you can download again as needed
[03:40:24] <gh555222> you could use mksquashfs or tar.xz

[12:24:19] <mlu> mort: it means taht they are unavailable

[12:24:40] <mort> I don't know what "unavailable" means
[12:24:41] <mlu> or, you configured it to work outside of NetworkManager

[12:28:30] <DLange> yes, but not to connect to the wifi

[16:08:01] <Gaboradon> ananke: so what I want is what I said in beginning, similar to Teracopy, basically --checksum does this.
[16:08:06] <koollman> Gaboradon: with that tool you generate checksums on the source part, copy using whatever, check on the dest part. then recheck later
[16:08:07] <ananke> Gaboradon: so rsync with checksum is NOT going to address the second issue. you may be better off using md5deep, or any other fast hashing implementation that can perform recursive scans

[16:24:36] <jason1236> it is quite old, but it is not that bad. Since WIN 95 runs on it.

[21:58:11] <agvantibo> Hello, I have a Lenovo C5621 PCI WWAN modem up and running with ModemManager + NetworkManager + ModemManager GUI, and I have a voice-call capable SIM on hand (my phone's, incidentally). How can I make and receive phone voice calls with it? I googled this question before, but nearly all answers I found have either mentioned only SMS or stated that the SIM wouldn't allow voice calling. A graphical solution would be doubly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

[22:16:55] <kittonian> hi all. need some help with docker and a .env file. i've asked in both docker and gitlab and no one is around to assist. the issue is that when I hardcode the variables in my docker-compose it works perfectly but when I use the .env it doesn't (keeps restarting the container). here's a paste of what i'm doing https://bpa.st/J4UA
[22:17:20] <kittonian> i've tried eliminating all the quotes in the .env. i've tried only double quoting the variables that need double quotes. nothing works
[22:17:34] <phogg> can you pastebin your file? What is sourcing it?
[22:17:43] <phogg> what does "hard coding" look like?
[22:17:49] <phogg> keep in mind that I don't know a thing about docker
[22:17:49] <agvantibo> jiffel, You know what, try these things: 1) switch usb cables 2) Rapidly replug all connectors about 50 times (oxidation cure) 3) If possible try to reboot the device. All kinds of things happen, reboot solves them very often.

[22:18:49] <ke4nhw> Is it better to use 'chown -R :groupname /targetdirtree' or to use 'chgrp -R groupname /targetdirtree'

[22:29:36] <kittonian> phogg, I'm fairly certain that this has to do with the fact that some of these variables need to be double quoted and since a .env file is automatically single quoted around all variables what's happening is it's getting back '"blah"' instead of "blah"

[22:30:06] <phogg> kittonian: if it follows normal shell syntax rules then single quoting is probably defensive (just to be safe) rather than required
[22:30:09] <kittonian> the file is being read just fine

[22:38:58] <hexnewbie> ZFS with compressed with zle compression will probably include you true RLE. Though I don't think either sparse files, or ZLE-compressed files would actually store a number for the upcoming bytes, as they are accessed randomly, not always read sequentially

[22:43:37] <tirnanog> it's probably your issue, regardless.
[22:44:03] <lorens[m]> tirnanog: the paste is correct. an empty line is a double newline at the end of the previous line, no?
[22:44:15] <phogg> lorens[m]: you have dos line endings
[22:44:18] <tirnanog> depends on the line ending format, for one thing.

[22:47:22] <phogg> lorens[m]: totally apart from the line ending issue your perl command is line-oriented so it can't match \n\n (you only ever see one at a time)
[22:47:29] <BCMM> Common-Lisp: see the "ControlMaster" option in `man ssh_config`. once it's set up, you can open a new shell to a host you're already connected to without authenticating again, or even waiting for the full handshake process
[22:47:45] <phogg> lorens[m]: or slurp it all into memory first

[23:02:46] <tirnanog> just add the /s modifier.

[23:02:58] <stanrifkin> SpeakerToMeat: so? please restate your situation.
[23:03:04] <SpeakerToMeat> the files inside are much larger apparent than disk. Exfat doesn't support sparse, so it's not because they're sparse, and the files are quicktime videos which will be very rare to have a large ammount of zeros.

[23:38:37] <matsaman> hexnewbie: yeah it's like cocaine
[23:38:46] <Abdullah> I wrote a script which checks for unread mail count in remote mail server and prints out the unread mails count to screen. so if there is a new mail in remote server, it should sync remote and local mailboxes. and play a notification bell. now both mailboxes are same, so it shouldn't sync or play notification bell. if there is a change in local mail server, (like I have read the new mail), it should
[23:38:47] <Abdullah> sync so both are again same. if there was a new mail in remote mailbox, it has synced the mailbox with local mailbox, so it shouldn't play notification bell next time for that same new message. I mean only should play notification bell if there is another new mail. But I'm confused how to do it. Here is my script. https://bpa.st/show/YPVQ
