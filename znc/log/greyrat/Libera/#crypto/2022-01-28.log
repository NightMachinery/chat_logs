[00:29:17] <TimMc> I remember as a kid trying to do something like that. Didn't find anything, but didn't let it run long enough I'm sure.
[00:29:58] <halosghost> well, with 16GB (assuming the stats I've seen hold up) allocation, you'd expect to see ~1 bitflip per day

[00:30:28] <halosghost> sarnold: well, assuming I'm understanding what it's doing with CPU pegged, that's actually it running the audit to check the whole buffer
[00:30:32] <sarnold> if you didn't mind trading time resolution, you could scan every hour or something

[04:46:10] <Alipha> FlorianBad: for key derivation (opposed to password hash storage), you definitely want a larger salt (256 bits) because if the salt collides (with the same password), you'll end up producing the same key. OR, you'll want to use a (independently) random nonce/IV, unlike what I suggested earlier
[04:48:15] <Alipha> Reusing the same key+nonce is catastrophic. So either you want to make sure that the key is never the same, or make sure that if the key produced is the same, the nonce is not the same
[04:50:23] <FlorianBad> Alipha: ok I see, so what would be an absurdly long salt that you would still want to consider? ;)
[04:51:02] <FlorianBad> because... if the cost is only a few bytes when storing a 50GB backup or so, then....
[04:51:41] <maroon> what's the block size of argon2's internal hash function? for sha256 it's 512 bits

[05:03:29] <MacGyver> I hypothesized that that *would* be a way to allow you to carry more entropy from the input into the output, if you don't consume the entire input at the start.
[05:04:10] <MacGyver> But I'll be honest, it's a bit of a janky idea now that I think about it again.
[05:05:09] <MacGyver> It'd be a bit like, okay, we first have a few individual runs of SHA3 for each block of input of size internal state, and then run SHAKE on the final block.

[06:37:19] *** Joins: linear_cannon (~linear_ca@50.35.78.163)
[06:37:59] <TimMc> The first part of their solution is to have both parties stream their data continuously and with low latency, both giving little chance to evaluate it for favorability, and to make it harder to fake up interference (when maybe the evaluation period that produces a bit is several orders of magnitude larger than the period of the pulsar).
[06:39:03] <TimMc> The second part is that all the bits will be hashed at the end, which makes it very hard to control. I think this mostly sounds good, except there's a risk that a malicious party could fake some discrepancies *near the end* if their simulations of possible hash outputs were unfavorable.
[06:39:34] <TimMc> I think the solution here is just to make the hash very expensive in CPU time, e.g. argon2 tuned so that it will take an hour to run. :-)

[07:09:08] <euouae> maroon, I kept reading a bit about SHA hashes. Your question about what's so special/broken about SHA-1, I read a lot of cryptographers got antsy with the SHA-2 family because of its similarities to SHA-1. I think SHA-2 has more nonlinearity in it.
[07:09:45] <euouae> Sorry I mean SHA1, SHA2. Then the SHA3 competition demanded a hash radically different from SHA1 & SHA2. 
[07:10:20] <maroon> euouae, the round function in sha2 is more complex than in sha1 - instead of doing different things in different rounds, sha2 seems to throw the whole kitchen sink in for all rounds
[07:10:59] <euouae> I'm implementing SHA1 in Rust now and it's quite easy
[07:11:08] <euouae> (I'm not attempting for security)
[07:12:23] <maroon> yep, 1 of the things they wanted in sha3 is that it be not vulnerable to the length extension attack - actually sha384 and sha224 are resistant to it, but only because they calculate exactly the same way as sha512/sha256 but then hide a portion of the hash digest - so you could get resistance from sha512 by simply hiding 64 bits and returning the other 448
[07:12:24] <euouae> well really that's all I could tell you for now. :D have a good one
[07:13:06] <euouae> ah yeah I did notice that -- what you were talking about yesterday with truncation, that's exactly what two of the SHA2 hashes do
[07:16:15] <FlorianBad> Is it almost-correct to say that if there wasn't the issue of repeating the same salt, Argon2 could sort-of turn a symmetric encryption into an asymmetric one?
[07:16:34] *** Joins: drathir_tor (~drathir@wireguard/tunneler/drathir)
[07:16:55] <FlorianBad> Well, if you have a process running that generates these Argon2 hashes and never reveals the password ;)

[07:18:18] <FlorianBad> (a running daemon that generates the Argon2 hashes and a new salt each time)
[07:20:24] <maroon> my understanding of asymmetric is like i described yesterday. in RSA you have 1 way of encrypting something, and a completely different way of decrypting that back to the original. And in DH you have 2 different number1^number2's which both generate the same answer

[07:27:10] <maroon> DH doesnt transform anything back, it's just a mutual way to reach the shared secret - even someone who knows both public keys plus Alice's secret key can't use that to figure out Bob's private key
[07:36:13] <Alipha> If you wanted an actual asymmetric process, you could generate public and private keys and give the encryptor the public key. Then it would be actually impossible for the encryptor to decrypt. Then you'd perhaps want to encrypt the private key with a password. Or, if you didn't like the idea of being able to lose the private key, you could directly generate public and private keys from a password
[07:47:37] <maroon> Alipha, the password would be the seed for how it chooses the RSA primes?
[07:49:04] <Alipha> maroon: could. Easier to create an ECC private key though (and then a public key from that)
[07:49:50] <maroon> ah i see, so could be normal DH too, where private exponent is XOF-hash(password)
[07:56:40] <Alipha> But DH generates a symmetric key, which would be used for encrypting and decrypting. The idea would be to create public and private key pairs so that the encryptor would only have the public key so that the encryptor could only encrypt and not decrypt
[08:02:11] <FlorianBad> was just trying to philosophize Argon2 ;)
[08:17:18] <Alipha> I mean, you'd use argon2 to generate a 256-bit hash that you turn into an ECC private key
