[05:12:33] <oneadvent> https://dpaste.com/5JGUBVWSR
[05:12:58] <oneadvent> it seems it is returning my checkbox as a dict...but that doesn't make sense
[05:13:28] <schinckel> The way you’ll generally use a form is to validate it:
[05:13:34] <oneadvent> https://dpaste.com/CC42WWFSV
[05:13:49] <schinckel> Why are you accessing request.POST?
[05:14:04] <oneadvent> https://dpaste.com/8PXXDG92M
[05:14:25] <schinckel> You pass the request.POST to the form as data, and then validate it. Then you reference form.cleaned_data[field_name]
[05:14:41] <oneadvent> so i tried with: is_california = bool(request.POST["is_california"])
[05:15:20] <schinckel> Don’t do that.
[05:15:24] <oneadvent> like this: is_california = form.cleaned_data['is_california']
[05:16:02] <schinckel> Forms are an abstraction that allows you to validate user data from request.POST or request.GET (or other sources) without having to acces the request body directly.
[05:16:20] <oneadvent> schinckel: yes sir...
[05:16:41] <schinckel> The way browsers send checkboxes is they are only included if they are checked - the Form abstraction knows this and sets the cleaned_data based on that.
[05:17:24] <oneadvent> ah...and that is why the others worked and that doesn't?
[05:17:36] <oneadvent> shouldn't i be using cleaned_data on all of them?
[05:18:03] <oneadvent> because that does work, i just want to know if i'm doing the rest wrong too
[05:18:05] <schinckel> You should only ever reference form.cleaned_data, and only after guarding with (if form.is_valid():)
[05:18:09] <oneadvent> (so problem solved)
[05:18:19] <oneadvent> gotcha schinckel
[05:18:22] <oneadvent> thank you
[05:19:12] <oneadvent> like this, right: pay_rate = float(form.cleaned_data['pay_rate'])
[05:19:54] <schinckel> You shouldn’t need to cast values coming from a form - your fields should be defined so they’ll give you “cleaned” values.
[05:20:00] <schinckel> Also, you probably don’t want to use float.
[05:20:51] <oneadvent> forms.DecimalField
[05:20:54] <schinckel> To see why, start a python shell, and type `0.1 * 12` into it.
[05:20:56] <oneadvent> checks for number?
[05:21:08] <schinckel> Yes, forms.DecimalField will give you a Decimal instance back.
[05:21:30] <oneadvent> got it, so kill the float, and use cleaned_data
[05:22:27] <schinckel> If you haven’t done the tutorial on the django website, I would strongly suggest you do. And if you have, maybe try https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_forms/
[05:22:33] <schinckel> (Or that whole tutorial)
[05:22:47] <oneadvent> unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'float' and 'decimal.Decimal'
[05:22:50] <oneadvent> yikes
[05:23:15] <schinckel> You can’t multiply floats and Decimals - but you don’t want to, especially if you are dealing with money.
[05:23:36] <schinckel> Use Decimal everywhere (unless you have a good reason to use float)
[05:24:17] <schinckel> Basically, floats are stored in a way that they are not always precise - not every value can be stored as a float. This is not a python limitation, but rather one of floating point numbers in general.
[05:24:30] <jim> would I use django.shortcuts.render() only if there's a template?
[05:25:05] <oneadvent> lol i have no idea where i have a float left....
[05:26:44] <oneadvent> https://dpaste.com/CG9JK9WA3
[05:26:49] <schinckel> oneadvent: It’s probably an implicit float - a constant value you have somewhere? 1.0 * X or whatever?
[05:27:04] <oneadvent> schinckel: yes i have those
[05:27:07] <oneadvent> hmmmm
[05:27:31] <schinckel> jim: Yeah - you can use JsonResponse if you are returning a JSON string, or HttpResponse if you have raw data you need to return.
[05:27:53] <schinckel> jim: You can use HttpResponse to return a “file” by setting a couple of headers, too.
[05:28:03] <schinckel> ie, make a browser download a CSV file or whatever.
[05:28:59] <oneadvent> would i need to pay_rate * decimal.Decimal(10)
[05:29:03] <oneadvent> (as an example)
[05:30:15] <oneadvent> start_base_pay = ((pay_rate * reg_hours) + (decimal.Decimal(1.5) * ot_hours * pay_rate) + (decimal.Decimal(2) * double_hours * pay_rate))
[05:30:18] <oneadvent> like that?
[05:30:53] <schinckel> Yes, but you’ll want to quote any values you pass to Decimal: `Decimal(‘1.5’)`, for instance.
[05:31:08] <oneadvent> lol all over the place too...i have a lot of those kinds of values
[05:31:09] <jim> schinckel, otherwise, I would need to establish a template? (this is me making a simple form, the form is working, but I can't get the form response to work
[05:31:13] <jim> )
[05:32:06] <jim> hmm, does python use `...`?
[05:34:18] <jim> no, `foo` is a syntax error in python
[05:38:45] <oneadvent> lol i using the errors to find where i need decimal.Decimal put in
[05:39:33] <oneadvent> got it, though i prolly have way more of those than i actually needed
[05:39:40] <oneadvent> looks crappy too

[05:40:14] <oneadvent> see
[05:40:18] <oneadvent> but it DOES work
[05:44:05] <oneadvent> ok thats enough for tonight. tomorrow i'll make the checkbox actually do things, other than exist (which is hard to do sometimes, eh?)

[07:25:20] <jim> cool... I got the url working by going back to basics, it's got a template, which renders
[07:30:52] <jim> how can I tell if the url for the form responder is actually from a <form action='that.url'>?
[07:35:24] <schinckel> You’d generally distinguish between GET and POST requests - but a form could also be a GET form.
[07:35:41] <schinckel> Generally `if request.method == ‘POST’:` is enough though.
[07:36:02] <jim> ok, thanks a lot :)
[07:36:04] <schinckel> If it’s a GET form, then you’d need to check if request.GET was non-empty, I think.
[07:36:25] <schinckel> Don’t discount GET forms - they are really useful for pagination+filtering.
[07:36:43] <schinckel> https://schinckel.net/2014/08/17/leveraging-html-and-django-forms:-pagination-of-filtered-results/
[07:36:48] <jim> what if it wasn['t a request from a form at all?
[07:37:01] <jim> can I detect that?
[07:37:16] <schinckel> You can’t really tell - a request is a request. If it’s a POST, then it _probably_ was from a form.
[07:37:42] <schinckel> If it’s a GET request, then you can look at the querystring.
[07:37:50] <schinckel> But that begs the question as to why you need to know.
[07:38:10] <schinckel> If you use POST requests as those that may mutate state, it should not matter if it came from a form or not.
[07:38:16] <jim> what if someone is trying to play with urls
[07:38:40] <jim> well I can ignore that for the moment
[07:39:13] <schinckel> Someone could be using a non-browser HTTP client - and those requests will be indistingu
[07:39:22] <schinckel> Someone could be using a non-browser HTTP client - and those requests will be indistinguishable from a form request.

[07:39:33] <jim> true enough
[07:39:56] <schinckel> There’s nothing special about an HTML form. It just makes it easy to have control elements that are included in the request body (or querystring, on a GET request)

[08:13:08] <schinckel> You get form ValidationErrors, and re-render with the “bound” form.
[08:13:34] <schinckel> That then populates the HTML form with the submitted data, which can be edited and re-submitted.

[11:16:37] <jtj90> Hi guys, I have a learning philosophy conundrum that I hope someone would kindly enlighten me: I feel troubled that i'm spending less time on learning the basic tutorial concepts to complete my assignments as I would copy, pasting/editing my professor's code from his tutorials. Is this perhaps the way to go? I feel kinda inadequate, because this
[11:16:38] <jtj90> way doesn't reiterate and emphasis the key ideas of MVT framework and understanding how to build the functions from the docs (even thou with some Python knowledge and understanding of MVT, I can understand the sample code, but I won't be able to write out everything myself)
[11:16:38] <jtj90> seems like this might be a productive way to scale up to be a better web dev. Should I be concerned of my inability to code from my mind or will such skills come naturally? ie i've been writing views and urls and now at least I remember render(request, context) and context takes a dict of model obj attributes (which has to be imported from
[11:16:39] <jtj90> app/models.py, assigning a variable object to a Model class).
[11:16:39] <jtj90> thanks please help, I wanna do a good server-side project and my quarter ends March 24

[17:54:49] <pycode> but as i said it is not referring to a specific model
[17:55:06] <pycode> it is like an "ability" to create or not a kind of process
[17:55:09] <GinFuyou> refer to User model then?
[17:55:33] <pycode> ah ok so for "general" i should move the permissions to User
[17:56:08] <pycode> GinFuyou, but wait ..WHEN does it make the difference? i mean if i set it to User or other model
[17:56:19] <pycode> if it is not mandatory, what is the purpose?
[17:56:48] <GinFuyou> Well, I'm not sure what is recommendation here, but I don't see anything notably bad with it.
[17:57:51] <GinFuyou> not sure, I guess it only matters when you actually limiting operations on given model-table
[17:59:35] <GinFuyou> or rather it helps automatic creation of those
[18:01:42] <pycode> GinFuyou, yes i thought it was correct to put the permissions inside the model when they are referring to the create/view etc permissions ON THAT model
[18:01:46] <pycode> so idk if it is wrong or not
[18:04:10] <GinFuyou> It's not fully logically consistent, but it's only downside I see, after all permission check is down to user.has_perm("<app>.<codename>")

[19:07:54] <vancha112[m]> Hey everyone :)
[19:08:16] <vancha112[m]> Does anyone know of a way to trigger flash messages for users through a custom django admin command?
[19:10:23] <moldy> what is a flash message?
[19:10:34] <moldy> and why do you want to do this from a management command?
[19:11:21] <vancha112[m]> moldy: the django messages framework
[19:11:38] <vancha112[m]> the built-in one that you can use to notify users of changes
[19:11:44] *** Quits: mxp (~mxp@185.16.205.131) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[19:12:23] <vancha112[m]> i want to use that because i use a custom django admin command to syncronize two databases. Every 10 minutes, a custom django admin command pulls in changes (if they exist) from an external database. If those changes override models belonging to certain users, i want to notify them through a message when they log in.
[19:13:10] <dodo> vancha112[m]: write a middleware that reads the messages from somewhere, and stores who has seen them?
[19:15:14] <moldy> so you want to do this when the user / browser does a request
[19:15:33] <moldy> your management command doesn't know when this will happen
[19:15:50] <dodo> hence middleware
[19:16:06] <moldy> what you can do: store some value in the database, then for logged-in users, in your view (or maybe middleware), check for that value, and then use the messages framework as usual
[19:16:09] <vancha112[m]> moldy: correct, messages are stored in sessions afaik, and are only removed when a user has looped over all of them (after they logged in) and read them.
[19:16:24] <vancha112[m]> I'll look into this middleware
[19:16:49] <vancha112[m]> I've only learned the basics of django, so I'll try and find out how to implement it that way :) thanks!
[19:17:40] <dodo> keep in mind that session data is probably volatile
[19:17:58] <dodo> so, if you want to display your messages to everybody you'll have to store them somewhere else

[21:13:51] <pycode> custom code
[21:13:52] <pycode> ok
[21:13:52] <pycode> :D
[21:14:31] <pycode> just wonder how can i implement the "check" to avoid adding different permissions on related things
[21:15:31] <moldy> 1) in your code 2) check for it in tests 3) look at additional db constraints maybe
[21:15:47] <pycode> k
[21:26:47] <pycode> moldy, maybe it sounds wrong, but i should look at permissions to create a custom queryset too, for exampple if the user has "user_can_see_deal" = True i will filter deal.owner = request.user and that's it BUT, if the user has "user_can_see_other_deals" = True i shoul change the queryset too to check if the request.user is inside the deal.followers, maybe permissions is the wrong term, i should call them "abilities" :D
[21:27:07] <pycode> i never seen a django code where permissions has used to change get_queryset

[21:46:49] <pycode> what is the correct field to store the permissions for users? i can create a permissions field in the User models and then using M2M relation but in that case after each save i should delete all the permissions of the user and put the new
[21:46:59] <pycode> maybe just an arrayfield to store the name of the permissions ?
