[00:18:41] <KillerWasp> I could create an online bank through IRC. Putting people's acceptance aside, the problem is that you would become a criminal under the law, so I would need licenses to support me. There is also the fact that you would need to travel to other countries to connect with local banks. Too much work to fart, waste of time to fart, so I forget the idea.
[00:19:48] <KillerWasp> In the end I have determined to do with a few other services related with command in IRC.

[01:03:38] <piou> it's not an encoding because encoding means a different representation of the same information, and a hash is never that because multiple inputs correspond to a single hash
[01:03:46] <piou> it's not a bijection in math terms
[01:03:57] <ProfSimm> piou: what about unique hashes
[01:03:59] <ProfSimm> :D
[01:04:10] <duuude> do they exist?
[01:04:19] <ProfSimm> Well if you blink, yes
[01:04:25] <penguino> is there a way to prove hashes are unique? i thought hash collisions are just highly improbable
[01:04:26] <piou> either it's a hash or it's unique, can't be both
[01:04:41] <piou> penguino: it's easy to prove they're not unique, pigeon-hole principle
[01:04:48] <ProfSimm> We have an empire built on Git hashing, UUID and so on
[01:04:53] <ProfSimm> It all relies on those being unique
[01:04:58] <ProfSimm> Sort of
[01:05:06] <piou> penguino: there are more inputs than outputs so we are guaranteed that there are collisions essentially
[01:05:07] <sonny> cryptographic you mean
[01:05:07] *** frau_dr_aoei is now known as doctrix_aoei
[01:05:13] <piou> ProfSimm: uuid isn't a hash
[01:05:27] <penguino> piou: ahh, i see
[01:05:29] <ProfSimm> piou: it isn't but it was comparably sized, I couldn't resist
[01:05:32] <Hash> hi

[01:05:43] <ProfSimm> Hah
[01:05:44] <piou> ProfSimm: the size is the issue, and the reason why it can't be unique
[01:05:47] <Hash> :D
[01:06:15] <piou> if it's a hash, it's not unique
[01:06:19] <piou> so not an encoding

[01:20:08] <hans> don't listen to piou, hashes are "unique enough". > to put it in age-of-the-universe terms, if you hashed a maxed-out 64bit-inode filesystem every millisecond (2**64 files every millisecond), you would need about 780 quadrillion times the age of the universe to have a 50% chance of finding a single collision in a single filesystem at 256 bits. the only way it's ever going to happen is if there's a severe weakness in the 
[01:20:08] <hans> algorithm.
[01:20:32] <piou> it's not the question though
[01:20:45] <piou> they don't contain the information of the source, so they're not encoding
[01:21:08] <piou> the fact that finding collisions randomly is difficult has nothing to do with that

[01:21:58] <ProfSimm> piou: thing is, you can describe every atom in the universe in a pretty short string, so size is not an issue for uniqueness
[01:22:21] <piou> it is an issue if it's easy to prove that collisions do exist
[01:22:27] <ProfSimm> piou: the real distinction is indexing vs. containing. Unique index can be much smaller than the things being indexes

[03:27:20] <junebug> oldlaptop, basically you design your code to look like the domain. For example, say you're working in payments. You may have a class that is a payment and it has two transactions (a debit and a credit) and each transaction has the logic for how to process itself. Rather than having some PaymentProcessor class and TransactionEnricher, TransactionValidator, etc classes that have nothing to do with the domain.
[03:27:24] <AbleBacon> well i told him about gitlab and jenkins for a controlled build, and he said he's heard of jenkins and we have it but he hasn't set it up yet
[03:27:38] <Decker> travis too
[03:27:44] <epony> ^ this is what US abuses to stir up the events leading to the sad and unfortunate human suffering and disaster on friendly lands between nations of own shared history from the same Slavic tribes
[03:27:48] <AbleBacon> i told him that this kind of thing is one of my specialties and he said "i told you we have it, but i haven't set it up" and i'm worried to bring it up again
[03:28:28] <oldlaptop> junebug: That just sounds like "not missing the basic point of objects" to me.
[03:28:37] *** Quits: Klinda (~superleag@user/klinda) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[03:28:51] <AbleBacon> and he's told me to prioritize this build manager over everything else, including the important deliverables that the managers are expecting. so like... i need to please the managers, but i also don't need my co-worker going off to the bosses about how i "refuse to follow his instructions" and getting me fired
[03:29:08] <AbleBacon> and like... talking to the managers is one of those things that will set him off
[03:29:26] <junebug> oldlaptop, absolutely. I see so many anemic objects where I work. Classes that just hold data and do nothing else. And the product owner comes in asking for some new behavior and we have to spend days figuring out where the previous engineer hid that functionality.

[03:30:21] <junebug> oldlaptop, Rather than the product owner just saying the credit transaction process has changed to xyz and us just going into the CreditTransaction object and changing the behavior there we have to jump between handler, processor, and validator classes
[03:30:22] <flakland> tell your manager hes a no skill weenie
[03:30:27] <flakland> who can't even code good
[03:30:36] <perro> you have a bigger problem than this project

[03:30:42] <AbleBacon> i have to work with this guy
[03:31:02] <oldlaptop> junebug: I generally like the concept of separating code and data, but you can't do that and do "object-oriented design" at the same time.
[03:31:08] <flakland> you have to show disgust that they can't even write such a simple build system in c#
[03:31:20] <oldlaptop> (And you shouldn't do that and try to use Java at the same time.)
[03:31:23] <junebug> AbleBacon, change your goal from trying to convince others to just giving your opinion once and letting it go. It's not your company who cares if they don't do it your way
[03:31:30] <AbleBacon> like, isn't there some sort of trail of logic that i can lead him down that will cause him to come to the correct conclusion?

[03:32:22] <AbleBacon> no scripting allowed
[03:32:29] <junebug> AbleBacon, delivery is not your job as an engineer. That's a manager's job. If you don't deliver that's on them for mismanaging their resources

[03:33:38] <InPhase> duuude: Actively elevating and distributing all speech as if all "viewpoints" are equal has proven to be a faulty strategy and a harmful redefinition of what free speech has meant for the rest of its history.  It was an experiment we tried starting only recently, and there have been many harmful consequences as manipulators have grown more systematic with their exploitations of the defects in this 
[03:33:40] <zzz> AbleBacon: your manager has a problem, not you
[03:33:44] <InPhase> approach.  So no, we should not continue blindly with this.  Accepting reality and facts matters more.
[03:33:51] <zzz> let the manager solve it
[03:33:59] <zzz> and be accountable for it
[03:34:12] <AbleBacon> ok, so i guess i just save our chats so i can show them if management has been like "why hasn't there been any progress?"

[03:34:22] <zzz> AbleBacon: no
[03:34:35] <zzz> stand up for yourself
[03:34:38] <Decker> is there a testing framework?
[03:34:52] <AbleBacon> i aksed him if i can use msbuild as a sort of back-end. i'm thinking he'll probalby say no, but it's worht a shot. msbuild is technically written in C#, so that meets his requirement
[03:34:55] *** Joins: penguino (~mrpenguin@user/mrpenguin)
[03:35:02] <AbleBacon> there isn't yet, but he's gonna want me to create one
[03:35:10] <Decker> for a build system you'll have to have configuration files of some sort - not exactly script - but you could write configs in a way ths't actually compatible with something else
[03:35:23] <Decker> and then drop the gui drag and drop form for adding tests and whatnot
[03:35:34] <junebug> AbleBacon, they may try to pressure you. That's their way of managing. But in the end if this doesn't get delivered it's on them. They're the ones who are ultimately responsible for that. Also, there's 20% more jobs than engineers to fill them so you'll be fine
[03:35:38] <InPhase> duuude: Notice that you think everyone should be able to judge what is real from available information (proven not to be true), yet at the same time you think no one is qualified to judge what is true, and thus no one can select out true or false things to curate.
[03:35:48] <AbleBacon> i'm thinking i'll have a C# class for each project we're working on that will contain the "script" that builds each files, does the linking etc
[03:35:59] <duuude> InPhase: What if the ones in charge of media and censorship are the ones lying, or what happens if they begin to lie? Who is going to stop them if they have shut everyone else and all people see is from their prespective?

[03:37:17] <InPhase> duuude: This is why we need to utilize expertise.  It is a complex world with complex information.
[03:37:22] <Decker> it's just some XML
[03:37:53] <AbleBacon> oh, that's an interesting idea
[03:37:57] <Decker> then just run msbuild on the sln
[03:38:02] <duuude> InPhase: those are very small section of people that seems to not include you. we need to expand that part of people, and that is through freedom of speech that is not realized with this restrictive and centralized media.
[03:38:03] <AbleBacon> i can't write XML for this, but i could write C# code that writes XML...

[06:10:21] <pulse> actually now i've read it again it's even more confusing
[06:10:23] <kee> pulse: That's not even written by the same people as wrote the license.
[06:10:27] <pulse> what does "in an executable" mean
[06:10:28] <kee> Best not to rely on summaries.
[06:10:29] <pulse> inside a .exe?
[06:10:38] <oldlaptop> in normative text: "3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form..."
[06:10:56] <kee> "executable form" â  "an executable".
[06:11:05] <oldlaptop> A PE32 .exe is "object code or executable code", so sure
[06:11:36] <kee> A set of English instructions is an executable form (you can execute the instructions) but it's not an executable, as we programmers use the term.
[06:11:38] <oldlaptop> "source code" is actually explicitly defined (small mercies) as the "preferred form of the work for making modifications to it"
[06:11:58] <milesrout> I think it's quite clear that the intent of the license is that you may redistribute modified copies of the licensed work. if you modify it, you have to give access to a 'source' version of the modified work. if the executable form is different from the source form, you have to distribute or offer access to the source form
[06:12:14] <milesrout> traditionally that means 'if you provide the ELF you need to provide the .c/.h source tree'
[06:12:31] <milesrout> but applied to javascript it presumably means 'if you provide the minified JS you need to provide or give access to the original javascript'
[06:12:50] <pulse> how does that apply to non-executable entities
[06:12:59] <pulse> what if i license a painting of a tree under GPL2
[06:13:11] <kee> Presumably the painting is the source code.
[06:13:12] <oldlaptop> I don't think the observation that GPL makes nonsense applied to things that aren't software is new
[06:13:17] <pulse> does that mean everyone that modifies that painting has to provide.. err, the psd file or something
[06:13:18] <milesrout> you shouldn't license paintings under GPL for this very reason. 
[06:13:23] <kee> pulse: Yes.
[06:13:36] <pulse> kee, just straight out yes? because i made the psd part up :p
[06:13:42] <pulse> what if it's just a lot of text.. a novel
[06:13:44] <milesrout> but if you do, I think that probably the PSD is probably correct.
[06:13:54] <pulse> .oO(has anyone ever licensed a literary work under GPL2?)
[06:13:54] <juliaEnv> how did this guy "zzz" end up? Banned?
[06:14:00] <kee> Well, if it was a Piet program, the PSD (or whatever) would be the source code.
[06:14:09] <milesrout> if you distribute a novel under the GPL I'd suggest you'd probably want to provide a link to or the original LaTeX source used to typeset it
[06:14:10] <kee> pulse: Yes, they have. I wouldn't recommend it, though.
[06:14:13] <pulse> .oO(err...dramatical work i guess)
[06:14:19] <milesrout> it's pretty obvious in most cases what the 'preferred form to modify the work' is
[06:14:33] <pulse> milesrout, fair enough
[06:14:37] <oldlaptop> juliaEnv: I
[06:14:46] <oldlaptop> *I'm not aware of any reason zzz ought to be banned.
[06:15:00] <pulse> i find it odd to begin with that someone would license a phpBB style as GPL2
[06:15:05] <kee> Licenses aren't code; they're a description of a social convention that's enforced by law.
[06:15:08] <oldlaptop> You can see all currently active bans by saying something like '/mode #programming +b'

[06:46:14] <newpy> why is git clone https://... not using my stored ~/.git-credentials ?
[06:52:12] <milesrout> newpy: what is the result of 'git config credential.helper' 
[06:52:29] <newpy> milesrout, hmm nothing
[06:52:31] <milesrout> my understanding is that it should be 'store' if you want to use the ~/.git-credentials file
[06:52:41] <smallville7123> newpy: try using ssh
[06:52:42] <newpy> yes, does it only save that per session or?
[06:52:50] <newpy> can't use ssh, my school locks it down
[06:52:54] <smallville7123> oof
[06:52:56] <newpy> well I can but then I'd have to vpn
[06:53:02] <smallville7123> then idk
[06:53:07] <milesrout> if you run 'git config credential.helper' you will only configure it for the current repository
[06:53:09] <zzz> oldlaptop: i'm not aware of any reason either. should i be worried? :p
[06:53:20] <newpy> milesrout, yes I think I can just type git config credential.helper store
[06:53:21] <milesrout> if you want to set configuration settings on a global level you want to use git config --global
[06:53:29] <newpy> ah I probably forgot --global
[06:53:33] <newpy> I had set it before
[06:54:12] <milesrout> i often make this mistake myself >.<

[06:54:22] <milesrout> i always thought global configuration should be the default...
[06:55:16] <milesrout> newpy: be aware that ~/.git-credentials is stored *unencrypted* on disk 
[06:55:56] <newpy> milesrout, yea I'm using an auth token to mitigate

[06:56:55] <newpy> I know a lot of servers lock down port 22, but is there a reason to do so when it's so useful to students?
[06:57:18] <newpy> too easy to crack?
[06:57:25] <milesrout> i can't imagine any reason to block *outgoing* traffic on port 22
[06:57:51] <newpy> well I'm assuming it's blocking the incoming request from me
[06:58:10] <milesrout> are the servers hosted at your school?
[06:58:14] <newpy> yes
[06:58:21] <newpy> and I am not at school
[06:58:57] <milesrout> most students probably have very simple passwords
[06:59:10] <newpy> yea I wouldn't be surprised
[06:59:17] *** Quits: snake (~snake@user/snake) (Quit: Leaving)
[06:59:39] <milesrout> but if you disable password authentication and have a whitelist of accounts that may be accessed by ssh, i can't imagine you'd have too many issues. 
[06:59:58] <newpy> is vpn somehow more secure?
[07:00:15] <milesrout> I don't see any reason why it would be
[07:00:25] <newpy> yea, bizarre
[07:00:28] <milesrout> my university has always had open ssh access to the linux servers for students, at least computer science students anyway
[07:02:03] <milesrout> although looking at it now you now need to 'register for remote access' to do this.

[10:51:19] <Hash> When you have friends and family, people are okay enough. When you're all alone, when everyone is dead, then people and the wrold start beating on you, because they kknow you have no one to watch your back.

[11:18:22] <Hash> v6 was the biggest one.
[11:18:51] <Hash> Ironman style gameplay. No item lasts. Can't repair. Durity goes down. Can't keep items for a long time. So can't get attached to any item.
[11:19:03] <KillerWasp> Hash: Also. It's not that I don't care. In fact I know the problems that everyone is going through, and I can't help you at all, nobody can. That's why I'm not commenting on anything, I'm not saying don't kill yourself or anything, maybe you can find a way to live if you're creative. Or maybe not, maybe the only solution is to be very drastic.
[11:19:08] <Hash> Can't jump into hordes of mosnters, you'll die. Can't use the same tactics like from Diablo 2
[11:19:26] <Hash> Ironman style of gameplay opens up endless possibilties of style of play and how to tackle monsetrs and stuff
[11:19:29] *** Joins: yitz (~yitz@exercism/yitz)

[11:20:33] <Hash> Runebag, Gembag, store gems and runes in bags to save space on inventory

[11:22:01] <Hash> buttons, GUI item positions, everything is changed. Also high resolution
[11:22:06] <KillerWasp> i see.
[11:22:13] <Hash> Also the biggest mechanical change in game
[11:22:17] <Hash> No item is useless
[11:22:35] <Hash> Peopel usually have to get filters to hide items they don't want to see on ground

[17:31:38] <bnchs> but the problem is that it will hurt google
[17:31:42] <bnchs> and phone companies
[17:32:14] <pikapika> It won't hurt them. Firmware is strongly coupled with hardware, there is nothing to be gained by "pirating" firmware
[17:32:28] <bnchs> no it will hurt them
[17:32:36] <bnchs> because they cant sneak shit into the firmware
[17:32:37] <pikapika> Of course, it would close the endless tap of money that is planned obsolecence
[17:32:44] <Decker> jamea but there is TIMESTAMP type which has a auto default value of now... no?
[17:32:49] <pikapika> But its a "problem" of their own making

[23:25:06] <pyzozord> what was the goal of creating a virtual file system to install sqlite on it?

[23:25:19] <Decker> encryption
[23:25:45] <Decker> sqlite could just be straight plain text like it is, while being in a file that's encrypted at the file level
[23:26:42] <Decker> and the memory map of the file only ever had the encrypted version...  but then it also memory maps the file for sqlite, so what it thinks of as a 'file' is already just memory backed

[23:31:50] <pyzozord> I understand the first part you are saying that sqlite could just save to a file, like it normally does, and it can encrypt the file too
[23:32:10] <Decker> and that file data is encrypted for it transparently to sqlite
[23:32:22] <pyzozord> and then I'm lost on memory maps. Who maps memory, what for, and how does it relate to the encripted file?
[23:32:24] <Decker> Sqlite also has a SEE module that you can give $$ for 
[23:33:31] <Decker> the file is mapped to memory by the vfs... and it just works with the memory image; letting the OS mirror changes to the file; this does poentially break ACID compliance of Sqlite in the case of power failures...

[23:36:15] <Decker> there's still slowness on initial load; when it has to swap disk to memory... but then after that you don't have to slow down to disk speeds to do things.
