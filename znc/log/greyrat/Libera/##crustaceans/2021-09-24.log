[00:00:29] <indigo> dimadima: Are you a fan of Go? ;) it's the very "don't introduce something else for me to learn" language
[00:01:10] <gwozniak> heh
[00:01:32] <gwozniak> I have nothing against DSLs as long as they are well documented and such
[00:02:10] <companion_cube> Enjoy your custom code generation instead :)
[00:02:24] <companion_cube> (well, generics are coming, at least)
[00:02:48] <dimadima> indigo: i've never programmed in go beyond fixing bugs but yeah it seems really nice. i'm generally a really slow person but i learned go by reading the spec in the course of one night and was pretty stunned by that
[00:03:11] <indigo> Yeah, it is surprising how small the language is
[00:03:16] <dimadima> i really like how the first paragraph of the java language spec states its purpose so clearly: "It is intended to be a production language"
[00:04:02] <companion_cube> I didn't have the net for 8h in the plane, so I read the one page zig documentation
[00:04:11] <companion_cube> And it's really nice, again
[00:04:14] <manicennui> "This language is for SERIOUS BUSINESS."
[00:04:15] <Brekkjern> The only programming language I have liked working in so far is Python tbh. Go is interesting, but a shitshow. Scheme hurts my everything. Tables start at 1 in Lua. JS and PHP don't really need any more reasons. Rust was just a confusing mess to get into at the time. Java is annoying to write...
[00:04:41] <Brekkjern> I actually don't really care that tables start at 1 in Lua, but it's a fun thing to complain about...
[00:05:18] <dimadima> Brekkjern: java basically requires an IDE. i stubbornly tried writing Java in vim for at least a year and that was very, very stupid
[00:05:32] <dimadima> once you get rolling with an IDE it's just completion after completion after completion the shit writes itself
[00:05:33] <indigo> Brekkjern: I love Python until I have to import an external library
[00:05:34] <Brekkjern> dimadima: I use Intellij for that reason :P
[00:05:42] <Brekkjern> indigo: Why?
[00:05:53] <dimadima> Brekkjern: well then :)
[00:05:59] <Brekkjern> I have more trouble dealing with relative imports than external ones :P
[00:06:10] <indigo> Brekkjern: What's the in-vogue thing these days for imports? Pipfile?
[00:06:14] <dimadima> python imports are freaking confusing if you don't use the language for a long time
[00:06:29] <companion_cube> indigo: poetry I think
[00:06:44] <Brekkjern> indigo: Oh. You don't mean imports, but installing packages?
[00:07:08] <indigo> Yes, sorry. To be precise: the whole packaging/deployment story for python
[00:07:13] <indigo> At least deployment is easy to take care of with Docker
[00:07:26] <Brekkjern> Ah, yeah... I usually write shit that goes in Docker, so I don't give a shit :P
[00:07:29] <gwozniak> yeah, packaging for Python seems like an eternal tire fire
[00:07:34] <Brekkjern> A requirements file works for that
[00:07:55] <Brekkjern> It's not great, but it works.
[00:08:38] <dimadima> c# is so underappreciatd i don't understand why it hasn't eaten java
[00:08:58] <dimadima> c#6 apparently got rid of the requirement to declare namespace and class, you can just write code (so i read on HN the other day)
[00:08:58] <companion_cube> Because until recently it was a windows only show
[00:08:59] <Brekkjern> I'd much rather do C# than Java
[00:09:03] <manicennui> dimadima: Because of its runtime.
[00:09:11] <Brekkjern> And I agree with companion_cube  there
[00:09:13] <dimadima> but it's open source now?
[00:09:14] <manicennui> For one, the JVM blows the CLR away.
[00:09:22] <dimadima> really?
[00:09:25] <companion_cube> Yeah but people don't jump ship in 3y
[00:09:37] <companion_cube> Especially the kind of people who use Java in the first place
[00:09:39] <manicennui> And the CLR is not exactly the same outside of Windows.
[00:09:39] <dimadima> i know the JVM is much lauded but CLR is that much worse?
[00:09:55] <indigo> So I've heard three solutions so far: requirements file, pipenv, and poetry
[00:10:06] <dimadima> makes sense
[00:10:10] <manicennui> dimadima: The default JVM options aren't even close to optimal. There are things you can easily turn on that make it even faster.
[00:10:36] <indigo> But does the JVM blow C away? Tune in for Drew DeVault's opinion
[00:10:44] <gwozniak> haha
[00:10:44] <Brekkjern> lol
[00:10:46] <dimadima> haha
[00:11:17] <companion_cube> Ouch

[00:12:16] <buttsbot> Sure if you are happy to struggle with V8 performance. | Hacker News
[00:12:47] <dimadima> how bad can v8 truly be
[00:12:54] <dimadima> i have yet to run it "at scale"
[00:13:00] <indigo> Hahah glad to be of service Brekkjern
[00:13:53] <companion_cube> dimadima: it has a lot to do to be fast
[00:13:56] <manicennui> dimadima: I mean, you can find benchmarks.
[00:14:19] <companion_cube> Starts with the big handicap that is a dynamic table based language
[00:14:31] <Brekkjern> IMO, execution speed is irrelevant as long as it's used for asinine shit.
[00:14:34] <manicennui> You will see languages like Python and Ruby near the bottom, then things runnin on V8 doing quite a bit better, than C/C++/Go/Java way above V8.
[00:14:45] <Brekkjern> It would be nice if it spent less juice on doing asinine shit, but it will still be asinine shit...
[00:14:46] <dimadima> manicennui: i didn't think he meant "benchmarks"-- also, "benchmarks"
[00:15:07] <manicennui> s/than/then/
[00:15:08] <dimadima> i suspect he meant v8 struggles with heap stuff
[00:15:18] <dimadima> GC, efficiency, that sort of thing
[00:15:20] <dimadima> not raw speed
[00:15:24] <Brekkjern> I assume all the various shitcoin miners are written in blazingly fast optimized C. Doesn't make the power usage any less asinine...
[00:15:29] <manicennui> I don't know. I think most of these types of things are not truly problems for most projects.
[00:15:37] <manicennui> And most of the problems in most projects are just plain bad code.
[00:15:51] <manicennui> Or IO.
[00:16:06] <dimadima> manicennui: that's what i've always assumed

[00:53:03] <Brekkjern> I expected to be working on it tomorrow evening :P
[00:58:35] <manicennui> Brekkjern: I guess the point is, when you use Racket or Clojure, you don't tend to use cons cells very much, and then you focus far more on the powerful function capabilities of lisps, and less on manipulating cons cells.
[00:59:44] <manicennui> I don't know what your class is exactly, but I can't imagine that implementing various data structures with cons cells would teach you much that you hadn't already scene with structs and pointers.
[01:00:00] <manicennui> s/scene/seen/
[01:04:48] <manicennui> I think cons cells are one of those things that are super elegant, but completely impractical, and one of the best parts of Clojure is that Rich Hickey was smart enough to realize this and not feel beholden to the lisp nerds.
[01:07:26] <riv> they are practical for some things, like pairing two objects, making linked lists, making a AST ..but not for everything
[01:08:18] <manicennui> I've never wanted to make a linked list.
[01:08:19] <Brekkjern> manicennui: The name of the course is "Functional Programming" and it's supposed to be a second/third year class in a 3 year bachelors course. Thing is, by that time you have already had Algorithms and Datastructures, and you were introduced to linked lists back in the first year, so...
[01:08:40] <riv> that's odd
[01:08:44] <manicennui> I realize that there are linked lists underlying some of the data structures I use, but I've never, ever, implemented one in production code.
[01:08:52] <riv> ok
[01:08:59] <riv> still quite strange
[01:09:07] <riv> I have made linked lists many times
[01:09:15] <Brekkjern> But why though? :P
[01:09:15] <manicennui> I've never written production C/C++ code either.
[01:09:17] <riv> in most languages i've done stuf in
[01:10:23] <manicennui> Because most dynamic languages have multiple data structures that are already highly efficient for most common use cases.
[01:10:32] <Brekkjern> From the reddit thread on files/folders:
[01:10:32] <Brekkjern> >"A recentish IT class I attended was fun, the 20-somethings were lost and then noticed the 30yo Boomer whizzing through it like a knife through butter and seeing a light switch on inside their eyes as you tell them how to do something on the old cogitator machine."
[01:10:32] <Brekkjern> >"Did this class take place during the Carter administration or something?"

[11:49:37] <buttsbot> Leaving Apples ecosystem and choosing tools which align with my mindset | Lobsters
[11:53:06] <bkero> Sounds like you're butthurt about some of the slightly misplaced apple shade
[11:53:09] <bkero> Would you like to tell us more?
[11:54:51] <gerikson> nah, nerds be nerds
[11:55:08] <gerikson> pointless whining isn't "throwing shade"
[11:55:16] <gerikson> that's from a position of superiority
[11:56:51] <gerikson> I also find it impressive for the linked post to find a way to unite both Apple kvetchers *and* i3/Sway enthusiasts into one happy ball of self-congratulation
[11:59:01] <gerikson> the same kvetchers are strangely silent here https://lobste.rs/s/zewarh/why_linux_desktop_has_not_yet_been_adopted
[11:59:02] <buttsbot> Why the Linux Desktop has not yet been Adopted by the Masses | Lobsters
[11:59:51] <gerikson> I mean, the obvious way to cut the GTK/Qt Gordian knot is to use i3/Sway
[12:04:37] <bkero> or xfce/lxde
[12:07:42] <river> there's always upsides. Upside of their being no petrol: Less pollution, safer cycling
[12:07:54] <river> also elon musk somehow profits from this, i guess?
[12:12:51] <gerikson> bkero: with this plethora of consumer choice, I don't understand why Linux has not swept all before it
[12:12:56] <bkero> Of course. Less petrol cars on the road, more room for electric and autonomous vehicles.
[12:13:11] <bkero> gerikson: It has. Look at Android and ChromeOS.
[12:14:11] <river> ok I will read this article

[12:17:45] <river> so first of all
[12:17:53] <river> maybe im reporting the wrong bugs?
[12:18:09] <river> because the last few times i've reported issues they've all been shot down
[12:21:03] <Brekkjern> I've heard quite a few "This is a problem with how upstream works. Closing this issue as we can't do anything about it."
[12:21:51] <Brekkjern> Wouldn't the right response be "This is a problem with upstream. I have created an issue in their tracker. Link here. Setting the issue to blocked until we have a response from them."

[16:26:29] <buttsbot> Turing Complete User
[16:27:03] <gwozniak> It's a decent essay that I don't really agree with all that much
[16:27:46] <gwozniak> Even though it takes a nice potshot at Unix at the end
[16:28:25] <gerikson> I always enjoy nice Unix potshots
[16:28:58] <gwozniak> ``We are the product of the “worse is better” philosophy of UNIX, the end-to end principle of the internet, the “under construction” and later “beta” spirit of the web.''
[16:29:17] <gwozniak> ``We are the children of the misleading and clumsy Desktop Metaphor, we know how to open doors without knobs.''
[16:39:42] <gerikson> gwozniak: I remember somewhere RMS imagining that Emacs would enable secretaries to become more productive by modifying their editor to suit their workflow
[16:40:49] <gerikson> > What the second part of this quote gets to so importantly is that Users are people who are very busy *with something else*.
[16:40:55] <gerikson> wow
[16:41:33] <gerikson> this is a great way to view it
[16:50:23] <gerikson> good link gwozniak
[16:55:19] <edm> may try appletv for the foundations
[16:55:32] <edm> i was thinking of getting the apple tv physical device anyway for my tv so maybe this is the impetus
[17:04:05] <ngoldbaum> edm: there are various ways to get free apple tv+, apple is basically giving it away to get people on it
[17:04:15] <edm> yes this is what i'm hoping
[17:04:26] <edm> if i buy the brick it will come with some free sub
[17:05:17] <edm> and ted lasso is apparently the funniest thing of all time so
[17:05:20] <edm> could all help with winter
[17:05:40] <ngoldbaum> ted lasso is good

[17:05:52] <ngoldbaum> nothing else is good

[17:06:50] <edm> oh that's a shame
[17:06:55] <edm> it looks pretty
[17:07:05] <edm> i like my 60s concept space art

[17:23:27] <gerikson> dimadima: oh man so much good stuff!
[17:24:21] <dimadima> yeah i read a bunch of their wikipedia article some time ago and always think of
[17:24:23] <dimadima> Werber imposed a stern training regimen on Guard, Shane, and Reynolds, rehearsing them for six to eight hours a day for several months, sending them to prominent San Francisco vocal coach Judy Davis to help them learn to preserve their voices, and working on the group's carefully prepared but apparently spontaneous banter between songs.
[17:25:00] <dimadima> don't know why that stuck in my mind

[17:31:57] <gerikson> I deleted my comment because my initial snark was not actually born out from reading the linked post
[17:32:25] <dimadima> yeah there's both identity AND money at stake for those people
[17:32:32] <gwozniak> edm: Ted Lasso is very enjoyable. Not hilarious, but just... good
[17:32:46] <gwozniak> As in good-hearted
[17:32:58] <dimadima> my sister jsut kept repeating that ted lasso was just "very pleasant"
[17:33:32] <dimadima> not unlike a person would describe an MDMA experience
[17:33:46] <dimadima> which was really, uh, compelling and disconcerting at the same time given that it's a TV Show
[17:34:01] <gwozniak> I like the way that "User" essay had me thinking about "the user being busy".  Where it goes with it is not quite on my wavelength
[17:36:49] <gerikson> well you are a developer...
[17:38:56] <ngoldbaum> developers 👏 developers 👏 developers
[17:39:09] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: pls to add this as a buttsbot trigger ^
[17:39:30] <ngoldbaum> perhaps with one more hand clap emoji
[17:39:50] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: That is an excellent suggestion. I'll do that this evening :D
[17:41:39] <gwozniak> gerikson: I found the notion at the end that users all want/should be programming to be misguided
[17:42:07] <gwozniak> Yes, we *can* probably all do that, but we don't really *want* to
[17:42:37] <gwozniak> Like tagging or categorizing all your data: we're capable of doing so, but it doesn't seem to happen
[17:43:07] <gwozniak> Sure, it does in come contexts, but it's not universal
[17:44:52] * ngoldbaum waits for an iphone 13 to show up
[17:47:10] <Geekingfrog> gwozniak, the article does mention that it's not the goal though. "There should be understanding of what it means to be a user of an “all purpose automatic digital computing system" and that doesn't mean everyone should be able to write programs
[17:48:39] <Geekingfrog> Sure, writing program is a way to achieve that, but being conscious of all the tools/software/app available, and how to combine them, sometimes creatively, is probably even more important.
[17:49:47] <gwozniak> True, but it seems to be ignoring the fact that a lot of the time people don't want to do that.  Sometimes you don't care about being creative or combining things, you just has a task you want to do
[17:50:39] <gwozniak> I don't like the "invisible user" idea very much. At the same time, you do want a plain old tool that doesn't demand attention a lot of the time
[17:50:59] <gwozniak> Namely, specialized apps
[17:51:13] <gwozniak> I found the essay demonized that a bit much
[17:52:20] <Geekingfrog> I think it's more about the trend that *everything* is becoming a specialized app
[17:52:32] <Geekingfrog> I agree they have their place
[17:53:20] <gwozniak> Yes, I don't want everything to be a specialized app, in the same way I don't want to have to make everything myself
[17:54:37] <gwozniak> In a related discussion where I found that link, someone was saying that "silos are the problem" in a way that suggests "if all data were open, our problems go away".  I find that attitude to be incredibly naive.
[17:54:59] <gwozniak> I'm glad this essay doesn't go that far
[17:55:09] <gwozniak> I think it's a good essay, though
[17:55:44] <Geekingfrog> There's definitely a middle ground, but I do agree with the article about the lack of awareness about computers, as general purpose machine. Any user can repurpose them, instead of "I'm not a compture person" and throwing their arm in the air.
[17:55:54] <Geekingfrog> Agree, that was a good read
[17:56:08] <Geekingfrog> I wasn't sure where it was going in the beginning though, glad I stuck a bit
[17:56:56] <gwozniak> That not-quite-misdirection is what made the essay good :)
[17:57:32] <gwozniak> I'm in agreement on the "I'm not a computer person" attitude. Annoys me very much when someone gives up without even trying
[17:59:02] <dimadima> most people aren't curious either by nature or by a lifetime of negative conditioning
[17:59:15] <dimadima> mostly the latter, in my opinion
[17:59:38] <gwozniak> I think people are curious but easily overwhelmed
[18:00:08] <gwozniak> When they think about the effort involved in following through on something, it's not worth it
[18:01:22] <gwozniak> I suppose "not curious enough" is a way of putting it
[18:05:22] <dimadima> there's a lot of intergenerational trauma with regard to curiosity
[18:05:51] <dimadima> i was raised in an environment where asking lots of questions was always emphasizes as a good thing
[18:06:03] <dimadima> and learned the hard way that people really, really disliek that
[18:07:00] <dimadima> my experience has been that people really dislike being asked questions of any variety
[18:08:35] <dimadima> i'm not sure i'm articulating what i mean, but eh
[18:08:40] <Brekkjern> The only type of question I dislike getting are questions where it is obvious that the other person hasn't thought about it at all, nor tried to figure it out themselves.
[18:09:02] <dimadima> programming is fucking hard and requires tons of basic interest and then perserverence as well
[18:09:33] <dimadima> Brekkjern: well, i'm only exposed IRL to americans, so maybe it's different where you are
[18:10:12] <dimadima> but i find that any question you ask--"what do you think about grilled cheese sandwiches"--is somehow, perhaps subconciously interpreted as an identiy thing and people feel pressure to answer" correctly"
[18:10:12] <Brekkjern> I've heard that the work culture is very different between our cultures, so maybe
[18:10:16] <dimadima> maybe it's the way i ask
[18:10:30] <dimadima> basic curiosity, i've found, is not rewarded
[18:10:43] <dimadima> being compliant, easygoing and "normal" is rewarded
[18:10:45] <Brekkjern> I think it's more about context to be honest
[18:11:22] <Brekkjern> If my first reaction is "Who the fuck are you and why the fuck would you want to know that?" Then I probably would respond in a hostile manner
[18:11:31] <Brekkjern> Situation depending of course :P
[18:14:42] <dimadima> americans are exceedingly rarely hostile. passive aggressivity is everything
[18:20:23] <prussian> it's normal to have zone transfers off, even in private work networks... right?
[18:31:19] <indigo> dimadima: I think it depends. I’m usually glad to answer questions but I have a coworker that asks a ton of them and can be super exhausting

[18:38:44] <dimadima> indigo: i didn't even mean work so much as life in general. and i guess i drifted from the original topic of curiosity, but i had in mind questions that probe the origin of another person's preferences

[21:22:28] <dimadima> yeah i feel bad for their child
[21:22:47] <dimadima> but who knows maybe grimes is a great mom
[21:38:44] <dimadima> i'm stoked about finally get this android
[21:38:51] <dimadima> can't wait to try it out
[21:45:12] <river> oh which one?
[21:45:25] <river> im actually trying to install lineage os on an android i just got given
[21:57:07] <dimadima> the pixel 4a
[21:57:21] <companion_cube> I installed calyxOS, pretty cool so far
[21:59:44] <dimadima> i'm going to try lineage or calyx at some point. my primary purpose is having a device for development, so i think i need the play store
[22:00:10] <dimadima> but once i'm comfortable with the play store testing worflow i think i'll be able to get rid of it
[22:00:39] <dimadima> i uninstaled whatsapp from my iphone the other day. bit by bit i'm going to drop all these apps
[22:00:44] <dimadima> i tihnk next up will be a migration off gmail
[22:00:58] <dimadima> fuck it all lol
[22:03:05] <river> ooh pixel!
[22:03:11] <river> that's a nice one
[22:03:26] <river> hm didn't know about calyx
[22:03:54] <river> why did you get rid of whatsapp?
[22:04:36] <river> I can use the google store because I install MindTheGapps
[22:04:42] <river> along with lineage
[22:05:34] <dimadima> oh just cause i assumed (perhaps incorrectly) that it reports tons of data to facebook
[22:05:43] <river> oh right, data
[22:05:56] <dimadima> like my location, etc. over the last few years i've become more tired of that
[22:06:25] <dimadima> river: i didn't now mindthegapps, thanks for that! i will check it out
[22:10:03] <companion_cube> calyx + microg + aurora works pretty well for me so far
[22:14:34] <companion_cube> Hmm it can't get your location without asking though, dimadima
[22:18:05] <dimadima> companion_cube: thats a good point haha i don't know why i said that
[22:18:41] <dimadima> i think the more accurate explanation is that i don't want an FB thing on my phone
[22:24:00] <companion_cube> Yeah it's a bit yucky
[22:24:05] <companion_cube> I need it though :(
