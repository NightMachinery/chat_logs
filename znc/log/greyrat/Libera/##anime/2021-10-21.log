[08:14:01] <MootPoot> now
[08:14:25] <jessedesu_onaph> Credit card
[08:14:31] <MootPoot> Swiss army huntsman, swiss army classic, gerber paraframe, or opinel with the carbon blade
[08:14:48] <MootPoot> probably the most acceptable ( socially ) is the classic
[08:14:51] <jessedesu_onaph> I carry a folding key knife

[08:16:00] <MootPoot> ^
[08:16:05] <MootPoot> cant carry a "weapon" here

[08:16:14] <MootPoot> lol
[08:16:21] <ButterNoodle> exactally
[08:16:41] <MootPoot> swiss army is probably very solidly in the tool category.... but the huntsman is like a 7 inch dick
[08:17:01] <MootPoot> Can't completely cover it with my hand
[08:17:03] <ButterNoodle> hide it in ur ass
[08:17:43] <jessedesu_onaph> Live in the city
[08:18:01] <jessedesu_onaph> If you need a knife just buy one

[08:52:49] <MootPoot> Instead of "I must win/succsseed etc" , now its just "I must try to do X"
[08:52:53] <jessedesu_onaph> Why am I so nostalgic
[08:53:02] <MootPoot> and the sucsess rate of trying is 100% in most cases
[08:53:08] <MootPoot> so its way easier to get me to do shit
[08:53:14] <jessedesu_onaph> I'm reminiscing
[08:53:47] <jessedesu_onaph> Mootpoot
[08:53:52] <jessedesu_onaph> Ever wonder
[08:54:04] <MootPoot> Kinder eggs
[08:54:36] <jessedesu_onaph> What that one girl you thought was cute in high school looks like now
[08:54:47] <MootPoot> no
[08:54:51] <jessedesu_onaph> Or do you move on
[08:54:58] <MootPoot> I went to a gender-segregated private school
[08:55:14] <jessedesu_onaph> Wat
[08:55:25] <MootPoot> the only cute girls were my anime bitches on rule34
[08:55:26] <jessedesu_onaph> That's cruel
[08:55:34] <MootPoot> It was fun 
[08:55:38] <MootPoot> I dont regret it
[08:55:41] <jessedesu_onaph> Yaas
[08:55:43] <jessedesu_onaph> R34
[08:55:44] <MootPoot> we did so much crazy shit
[08:55:52] <jessedesu_onaph> Wins everytime
[08:55:54] <MootPoot> putting porn on the class projector
[08:56:05] <jessedesu_onaph> Except when there's 0 hits
[08:56:30] <MootPoot> I used to go to a mixed gender private school for middle school
[08:56:37] <MootPoot> the girls always fucking taddled on us
[08:56:48] <MootPoot> fuckin goody goody 2 shoes bitches
[08:56:49] <jessedesu_onaph> For what
[08:56:53] <MootPoot> anything
[08:57:08] <jessedesu_onaph> U weren't gentlemen
[08:57:28] <MootPoot> bringing a non school approved book ( literally a captain underpants book ) , playing games in class, skipping class, cheating or helping others cheat
[08:57:40] <MootPoot> they were just the 1984 type
[08:57:53] <jessedesu_onaph> What's with 1984

[13:37:40] <amigojapan> Ok Cryowolf 
[13:38:44] <Cryowolf> I might be writing for The Lost Lands next year
[13:38:57] <Cryowolf> and then I'm building my own world
[13:39:08] <amigojapan> Nice
[13:41:03] <Cryowolf> It will be a dark fantasy meets meta-fantasy and spiritual fantasy
[13:42:14] <Cryowolf> for example, spirits in the world can "join in" with the material world, but then they become part of that and i ts function. Either in a good way or a bad way. Forexample if it's a strong enough spirit, it can create a waterfall that runs into a river to keep villagers away from the drought of a desert
[13:42:50] <Cryowolf> So that would have been a spirit that became that old waterfall and brought life back into it, if it leaves, it stops flowing
[13:42:54] <Cryowolf> same if it dies
[13:44:14] <Cryowolf> You could alsohave a spirit became part of a river and poison it and turn an entire village into that of zombies that the spirit controls after it drank of the spirit and it killed them to ma ke soldiers

[13:54:55] <Cryowolf> amigojapan, but there is no international office for copyright 
[13:55:07] <Cryowolf> you have to "register" for every indivdiual country
[13:55:30] <Cryowolf> which is why you usually just don't. You make sure the information is registered to be out there
[13:55:55] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: it would be funny if jk Rowling sued the library of babble for having the whole works of Harry potter
[13:56:35] <Cryowolf> unfortunately thats something she might have to do depending on what they do. You have to legally enforce your trademark
[13:56:41] <Cryowolf> if you don't you lose your rights to it

[13:57:53] <amigojapan> Cryowolf: the library of babble just has a copy of every combination of English letters
[13:58:11] <Cryowolf> technically all they do there is register that your text existed on that date
[13:59:45] <Cryowolf> you have to enforce it yourself
[13:59:49] <Cryowolf> and for that you need lawyers etc

[14:28:22] <emmeka> DunceCotus no, it is. all possible combinations of letters are in there. the chance of any particular word or phrase appearing should be 26... no, it has commas, spaces and periods, so 1/29^# of characters in the phrase
[14:28:29] <emmeka> this gets out of control very quickly
[14:28:35] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: it is based on a book written by a mathematician who proved it was possible
[14:28:39] <DunceCotus> yes but entire books?

[14:34:34] <DunceCotus> Its not just encapsulating your search terms in gibberish and showing you what you want to see as you can record the ‘seed’ used in order to find the terms, and search for that book again and it will always be located at the exact same spot, therefore its technically there, but they dont need to dedicate infinite supercomputers and an infinite amount of storage space to store strings of gibberish - all they need is an algorithm."

[16:04:38] <DunceCotus> JesseDesu: the pipeline is: use ipad sculpting software to sculpt model, export to 3D files, import 3D files into meshmixer for cleaning up/making printable
[16:05:08] <DunceCotus> meshmixer has presets for a bunch of 3d printer models and brands
[16:05:14] <JesseDesu> what does meshmixer do that the sculpting software doesnt
[16:05:30] <DunceCotus> JesseDesu: makes it into a model that can be printed good
[16:05:44] <DunceCotus> hollows it out, generates support structures etc.
[16:05:53] <DunceCotus> plus you can view how big it will be on the platter
[16:06:00] <JesseDesu> you mean like sprues
[16:06:11] <DunceCotus> sprues?
[16:06:17] <JesseDesu> does it cut joints
[16:06:29] <JesseDesu> have you ever built a model kit?
[16:06:39] <JesseDesu> that wireframe the parts are on
[16:06:43] <JesseDesu> are called sprues
[16:06:46] <DunceCotus> oh
[16:06:53] <DunceCotus> I think you can cut bits off etc
[16:07:04] <DunceCotus> joints not sure, it has pivots?
[16:07:23] <DunceCotus> JesseDesu: yes it can generate supporting sprues
[16:07:27] <DunceCotus> for 3d print good
[16:07:33] <JesseDesu> ok so does meshmixer provide a way to cut a model for complex parts
[16:07:44] <JesseDesu> like the hair
[16:08:28] <DunceCotus> I think so
[16:08:29] <JesseDesu> or if i want to break it apart and put guide pegs/holes for glueing
[16:08:33] <DunceCotus> you can select a portion of the mesh
[16:08:49] <DunceCotus> its probably best though to make those separate models
[16:09:34] <JesseDesu> ok i'm talking about like this https://www.ebay.com/itm/EVA-Ayanami-Rei-Unpainted-Resin-Garage-Kit-Model-Anime-Figure-1-6-Scale-In-Stock/282938833132
[16:09:35] <ImoutoBot> [title] EVA Ayanami Rei Unpainted Resin Garage Kit Model Anime Figure 1/6 Scale In Stock | eBay
[16:09:38] <DunceCotus> the point of 3d printing is it shouldn't require gluing
[16:09:49] <JesseDesu> see how the joint has a guide structure
[16:10:14] <DunceCotus> hmm
[16:10:30] <DunceCotus> JesseDesu: I really have not looked far enough at meshmixer to say if that's possible
[16:10:31] <JesseDesu> DunceCotus, i want to sell it to people who will glue and paint it themselves
[16:10:32] <DunceCotus> I think it is
[16:11:21] <JesseDesu> i have a market i could tap into
[16:11:36] <JesseDesu> theres a lot of characters that dont have their own figures

[16:17:35] <darkwitch> you are feeling even more sleepy
[16:17:36] <potatoxel[m]> JesseDesu: noo
[16:18:51] <potatoxel[m]> well librachat bridges all their irc channels to matrix
[16:18:58] <potatoxel[m]> libera*
[16:20:16] <amigojapan> Once davic banned all matrix users by accident and did not fix it
[16:22:50] <Sadale> nya~ :3
[16:22:51] <amigojapan> potatoxel[m]: does matrix offer a service like an IRC bouncer?
[16:23:25] <potatoxel[m]> amigojapan: lol
[16:23:27] <potatoxel[m]> amigojapan: whats that
[16:23:43] <amigojapan> Sadale: we were talking about the library of bable earlier
[16:24:29] <amigojapan> potatoxel[m]: like a way to see messages you missed when you were disconnected? Like on a phone
[16:24:41] <potatoxel[m]> yee
[16:24:58] <potatoxel[m]> the bridge stores em messages
[16:25:08] <amigojapan> Ah ok. I may check it out, if it is free bouncer
[16:25:29] <potatoxel[m]> ur a free bouncer
[16:26:10] <potatoxel[m]> i could setup one for me other than matrix's cuz i have a vps
[16:26:26] <potatoxel[m]> but here is the thing i dont know how to initiate a dm
[16:26:36] <potatoxel[m]> if i do its e2e and that obv doesnt work
[16:26:43] <potatoxel[m]> because there is no e2e in irc
[16:26:44] <amigojapan> DM?
[16:26:50] <potatoxel[m]> e2ee*
[16:26:52] <potatoxel[m]> yes
[16:26:53] <amigojapan> Pm?
[16:27:04] <potatoxel[m]> Direct message
[16:27:14] <potatoxel[m]> i dont call irc's private messages cuz they arent e2ee.
[16:27:26] <amigojapan> potatoxel[m]: on IRC there are private messages, not direct messages
[16:27:39] <JesseDesu> i'm going with sculptura
[16:28:19] <potatoxel[m]> amigojapan: what is the difference in ur definition
[16:28:22] <amigojapan> potatoxel[m]: anyway you just type /msg nick message
[16:28:26] <potatoxel[m]> i consider non e2ee dm's
[16:28:50] <Sadale> amigojapan, oh
[16:29:05] <amigojapan> potatoxel[m]: IRC existed before matrix and gets to call is messages what it wants
[16:29:07] <Sadale> amigojapan, no hablo español. xD
[16:29:32] <potatoxel[m]> amigojapan: i dont consider them private messages
[16:29:33] <amigojapan> Sadale: nobody is speaking Spanish
[16:29:41] <potatoxel[m]> because they are not e2ee
[16:30:00] <Sadale> amigojapan, oh I thought that you said tower of babel. You actualyl said library of bable
[16:30:46] <amigojapan> Yup. And I don't see where you get Spanish from that

[17:12:56] <Sadale> amigojapan, Learn using spreadsheet on computer instead. It's far more efficient

[17:13:39] <amigojapan> Sadale: this teachers more theory about how to keep books not a home

[22:20:48] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Until studies confirm it's more harmful to have it available than not (and release valve mechanism suggests it's not), don't get into that nonsense.
[22:21:11] <ButterNoodle> greed will always win in humans.. some of us are smart enough to keep the rest in the dark and fuck them in the ass
[22:21:16] <MootPoot> this is just a guideline
[22:21:16] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Their "deep concern" is based on nothing but personal moral indignation with no scientific backing whatsoever.
[22:21:32] <MootPoot> not a mandate or a actual thing that countries vote on and make into policy
[22:21:52] * MootPoot shrugs
[22:22:10] <ButterNoodle> whats that
[22:22:14] <Jigsy> Loli is illegal here in the UK, anyway.
[22:22:17] <Jigsy> Never stopped me, though.
[22:22:25] <ButterNoodle> and the land of kangaroo sex
[22:22:42] <ButterNoodle> *ideas are dangerous
[22:22:48] <Roey> heh
[22:22:51] <Roey> apparently.

[22:23:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I mean, UK banned encryption and not incriminating yourself so...
[22:23:24] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They don't have a track record of good ideas.
[22:23:49] * Jigsy doesn't encrypt anything.
[22:23:53] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Key-disclosure laws are functionally equivalent to banning encryption.
[22:23:58] <Jigsy> Encrypting artwork seems like a dumb thing to do, anyway.
[22:24:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Jigsy: The transfers.
[22:24:09] <MootPoot> I get your point, but this shit gets tossed out every few years for some PR points then it gets ignored
[22:24:15] <MootPoot> rinse and repeat

[22:24:54] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Whenever one of them shows up, know that the smell you notice is the scent of a lying scumbag.
[22:25:06] <ButterNoodle> fascism will be fascism 
[22:25:32] <Jigsy> I always operate on the M.O. that all fucking politicians should fucking hang.
[22:25:37] <Jigsy> At least here, anyway.
[22:25:40] <Jigsy> Same with journalists.
[22:25:42] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[22:25:47] <Jigsy> Fucking hate journalists.

[22:27:49] <MootPoot> klaxa: those are also minigames in the game of popularity
[22:27:57] <Jigsy> If they went all Musollini on themselves though, I wouldn't object.
[22:27:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'm not joking. Resorting to the horsemen is a blatant manipulation attempt and should lead to the user being laughed out of the conversation.
[22:28:15] <MootPoot> do horsemen have cocks
[22:28:29] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Besides the point.
[22:28:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Bastards and scumbags come in all sexes.
