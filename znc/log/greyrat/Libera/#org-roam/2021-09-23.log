[00:52:45] <rdrg109> Tisoxin: Did it. I just added a function in org-roam-capture-new-node-hook: http://0x0.st/-3FK.el
[00:53:06] <rdrg109> You mentioned org-roam-captuer-new-node-hook before, but I don't know if this is what you did.
[00:54:06] <rdrg109> Anyway, a drawback of doing this is the fact that it affects all templates in org-roam-capture-templates. I wonder if there is a better way of doing this

[01:06:51] <Tisoxin> i don't think there is a better way :/
[01:07:02] <Tisoxin> though for the created property it's good enough imho

[03:49:08] <rdrg109> This is related to what we were talking about: Now, how to set any number of properties when executing org-roam-extract-subtree?

[17:27:04] <rdrg109> [Q] Have any of you managed to insert a newline between the properties drawr at the top of the file and the "#+TITLE" line? If I insert an empty line in the template, it is not inserted, for some reason.
