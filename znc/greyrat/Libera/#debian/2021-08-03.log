[02:43:15] <kittonian> like I said, it's like a permissions issue or a missing dependency (though that's unlikely as it wouldn't get through config or compile if that was the case)

[04:21:03] <PMT> Comparatively, sure.

[16:26:23] <bolovanos> I would like to set crontab as it starts command once a day between specified time. Is that possible?

[16:27:45] <aminvakil> would be
[16:28:15] *** Pajus_ is now known as Pajus
[16:28:18] <PMT> It's crontab, running a command every so often is the whole point.
[16:29:07] <aminvakil> PMT: running it at a random time in an hour for example can't be done from cron, right?
[16:29:48] <PMT> I'm not aware of a direct way to make cron do that, no, I'd probably tell it to spawn at the beginning of the range I wanted and put an equivalent of sleep $RANDOM 
[16:29:56] <aminvakil> exactly
[16:30:45] <PMT> I didn't take their question as being "randomly within interval", I took it as "run within this interval"
[16:31:33] <Khepra> both crontabs and timers have pros and cons.

[16:34:57] <PMT> Heh, now I'm reminded of when I improved the backups scheduling at a prior job - it used to be that it triggered backing up everything at approximately the same time, which scaled _great_, so we shoved probabilistic constraints in (they were DB servers, so they were doing "full backups every N days, incrementals otherwise", which changed to "probabilistically decide whether to do full or incremental with P 
[16:35:03] <PMT> nonlinearly going to 1 as N days since backup is reached for a given database").

[16:39:35] <bolovanos> jelly, I think better than all jobs running at same time...
[16:40:17] <PMT> bolovanos: sure, but that still clumps everybody backing up on the same days, it just tries to directly avoid too many running at once.

[16:43:21] <Khepra> PMT: jitter ftw
[16:43:23] <jelly> backup software at my $work uses most of the above approaches, 1) backup window to randomly start backups in a time frame 2) limit of parallel jobs, both globally and per client db but 3) choice of full vs incremental vs differential I had to script on my own
[16:44:35] <PMT> What does incremental versus differential mean here?
[16:44:51] <Khepra> Or do what I do.... live replication offsite as a form of backup. No sudden bursts of flows, no big dumps, no downtimes caused by dumps (database tables lock on dump, and if you're using taht toy MySQL, whole DB locks)
[16:45:24] <jelly> replication is for DR not backup
[16:45:42] <Khepra> is for backup if you replicate offsite
[16:45:59] <jelly> only if you have older copies in case of human error
[16:46:08] <Khepra> yes, zfs snapshots
[16:46:42] <jelly> right, that's more than mere replication
[16:46:56] <Khepra> my point here being using repl to duplicate data, real time (as added bonus) elsewhere. snapshot it or dump it or whatever, oon the repl/backup side so the prodis not overwhelmed
[16:47:11] <Khepra> so the *prod is
[16:47:52] <Khepra> definitely beats running pg_dumps or mysql dumps in prod and then shipping that somewhere. 
[16:47:55] <jelly> it's a useful tool in the shed if you can afford it, just like offloading read-only queries for analytics to online replicas is
[16:48:24] <Khepra> not sure what affordability is in the equation. you already do have offsite server capable of receiving backups, no?
[16:48:39] <jelly> no
[16:48:46] <Khepra> then you don't have backups?
[16:48:58] <jelly> it's not a server.  It's a tape library.
[16:48:59] <Khepra> or are FTP'ing them to a cloud
[16:49:09] <Khepra> jelly: offsite or onsite?
[16:49:14] <jelly> second site
[16:49:40] <Khepra> and this library is attached to a server, (debian) linux presumably, taht receives that data stream and shoves it into tapes?
[16:49:42] <PMT> Yeah, the way the thing at $OLDJOB functioned was that it did track backup state per DB per server, but the actual scheduling configuration that triggered taking backups triggered backing up everything on the server serially at once in the same fashion (e.g. all full versus all incremental).

[16:50:00] <jelly> Khepra, sure, but the server is on the primary site
[16:50:03] <Khepra> jelly: so, you DO have an "offsite server capable of receiving backups"......
[16:50:08] <jelly> Khepra, nope
[16:50:19] <Khepra> why is this so hard to understand :) maybe I should produce cliff notes
[16:50:33] <jelly> there's no server on the second site
[16:50:44] <Khepra> so what's your transport layer to the tape?
[16:51:02] <jelly> FC SAN
[16:51:19] <Khepra> so that's all in teh same building or you ship it tunneled?
[16:51:32] <bolovanos> my transport layer to the tape is buying tape backup :D

[17:03:38] <Blondie101010> the typical solution I've seen isolates user information in a vault
[17:04:05] <jelly> imagine you have 1k or 1M or 100M users.
[17:04:16] <Blondie101010> unlikely but sure
[17:04:35] <Khepra> unlikely? That's "Tuesday" for ISPs
[17:04:41] <jelly> 1M vaults are going to be a bit problematic to manage
[17:04:54] <Khepra> That's "Front desk annoynance" for Google and other BigData megafarms.
[17:05:53] <jelly> so most ISPs employ some kind of whiteout and pretend the info doesn't exist any more even if it's merely hard to access 
[17:06:34] <jelly> if you delete a file from a filesystem on a HDD, the blocks still retain the data right?

[19:29:28] <f-a> hello lovely people. I have just downloaded debian-10.10.0-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso and would like to put it on my usb stick
[19:29:46] <f-a> usually I would `dd if=/…iso of=/dev/sdb`
[19:30:22] <f-a> but this time I would like to: • have the stick bootable with the installer and • also have some kind of other partition where I can put files, etc.
[19:30:29] <f-a> is that possible? and if so, how?
[19:31:23] *** Joins: Tokamak (~Tokamak@107.117.203.210)
[19:31:30] <amacater> It's possible using third party utilities, yes - or just use a Debian live? Be aware that that image will not be there in Bullseye
[19:31:44] <amacater> As we couldn't fit it on one CD
[19:33:12] <Khepra> f-a: what files? maybe you can "repackage" the ISO using the third party utilities that amacater mentioned
[19:33:16] <amacater> Actually, I've not checked: if you dd the iso onto a stick - I don't know what gparted would make of the unused space
[19:33:24] <Khepra> like, unpack the ISO, add/alter files, repack the ISO

[19:41:13] <amacater> f-a: What jelly said. I'd almost be tempted to have 2 x USB. One for the intsall medium and put your files on the other one.

[19:42:36] <f-a> also I suspect I downloaded the «wrong» image since I am going to use it in late august and I want stable…
[19:43:04] <PMT> Stable now is buster. Stable then might be bullseye or if there's more delays it might still be buster.
[19:43:05] <jelly> d-i is notoriously fragile if you use other more generic tools that mangle bootable images (unetbootin, etcher)
[19:43:07] <amacater> I'd be tempted to treat your special files as something you'd slipstream in like firmware - so add in at some point during / after the install.

[19:44:22] <jelly> August which year?!
[19:44:24] <amacater> Bullseye RC3 is almost exactly ready to be release quality :)
[19:44:34] <PMT> amacater: sure, it's likely, but it's not certain until it actually comes out. :)
