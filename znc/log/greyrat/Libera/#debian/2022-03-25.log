[01:27:24] <Khepra> unlike sysv crap that required pHD in shells, systemd units are designed to be easily written and adjusted by the user
[01:27:59] <Khepra> and systemd unit crap that ships with debian is mostly crap that needs rewriting anyway
[01:29:39] <jmcnaught> Sure but a package like popularity-contest does not have a .timer unit, only a /etc/cron.daily/popularity-contest for which having anacron installed will help ensure that the task is still run even if the computer is powered off sometimes.
[01:30:39] <nickgaw> anacron is already installed I just want to make sure it does run.

[01:30:57] <Khepra> just because a package doesn't install a .timer, doesn't mean the user can't.  and my suggestion here is to write a .timer unit, instead of cron, because status on .timer units tells you last time it ran and how long until next time
[01:31:28] <Khepra> the question was "how do I check to make sure it runs"... the answer is: easiest with .timers. otherwise grep the syslogs
[01:31:46] <nickgaw> ok I will look at the logs.

[02:12:54] <Khepra> nickgaw: is it a third party .deb ?
[02:13:06] <nickgaw> yes downloadable from their web site.
[02:13:42] <PerfDave> You can probably install it with "sudo apt install ./whatever.deb" then
[02:14:14] <nickgaw> I was going to use dpkg -i but on a virtual machine apt wants to download dependencies should I let it do so?
[02:14:26] <Khepra> nickgaw: if you can configure an apt sources.list source, then that'd be preferable from one time install of a .deb
[02:14:41] <Khepra> unless the .deb itself installs the source url, as some packages do that
[02:14:46] <nickgaw> On the zoom.us web site no such a source exists.
[02:15:05] <Khepra> nickgaw: don't use dpkg, use apt install ./path/to/file ;  note the ./ if the path is in your CWD
[02:16:07] <Khepra> nickgaw: if you're familiar with snaps or flaptaks, perhaps use that.
[02:16:22] <Khepra> I'd rahter install a snap or flatpak, than a third party root-level .deb

[15:05:49] <sufodnfaptinstal> oh, well, that's good to know for the future

[15:06:06] <kjetilho> Khepra: zigbee is a different protocol (it meshes all your devices in your home), but bluetooth is probably more convenient for on-the-go, since it is builtin
[15:06:56] <Khepra> sufodnfaptinstal: depends what exactly you dd'ed. but technically you should be able to checksum (eg. with md5sum) two block devices you dd'ed, and compare them that way
[15:07:07] <sufodnfaptinstal> of course!
[15:07:21] <sufodnfaptinstal> how long will it take to checksum 10 TB of data?
[15:07:25] <sufodnfaptinstal> 3 minutes?
[15:07:30] <sufodnfaptinstal> 4 minutes?
[15:07:38] <Khepra> kjetilho: I read recommendations to just get some bluetooth controlled plugs, which are then agnostic to device.  oh, but that was for USB chargers, as I need the same for my tablet and phone
[15:08:13] <Khepra> sufodnfaptinstal: depends. assuming that's HDD (spinning rust), you're probably seeing something like ~100 MB/s (up to 150 on modern drives), so do the math
[15:08:35] <sufodnfaptinstal> how do i do the math?
[15:08:49] <sufodnfaptinstal> my IQ is less than 110 at this point
[15:08:54] <sufodnfaptinstal> it will be hard to figure out
[15:08:58] <kjetilho> sufodnfaptinstal: 10 TB is 10 000 000 MB
[15:09:21] <Khepra> if you can't figure this out yourself, you absolutely should not do anything as root on your systems
[15:09:30] <kjetilho> chop off 2 zeroes, you get 100 000 seconds.  eh, what?

[15:11:01] <sufodnfaptinstal> the files all look like they are there

[15:15:04] <Khepra> possible it went through unschated, but I wouldn't put a single dollar on that bet
[15:16:11] <sufodnfaptinstal> okay, so i really should use a hash comparison. i was hoping to avoid that. I don't think i can use gtkhash on an entire drive, is there any graphical interface i can use to do a hash check?
[15:16:15] <Khepra> sufodnfaptinstal: another thing, are you copying from a disk that's actively in use?

[15:30:26] <Khepra> sufodnfaptinstal: it might take even more becusee it's filesystem level instead of block level and needs to read TWICE
[15:30:37] <sufodnfaptinstal> oh no!
[15:30:40] <sufodnfaptinstal> that's so long
[15:30:47] <ede> 10 TB iirc?
[15:30:56] <Khepra> if it took 27 hours to read from one disk, it's reasonalbe to assume this would take twice
[15:31:04] <sufodnfaptinstal> is there any way to do a hash estimation? just look at every 100 bits to see if they math?
[15:31:12] <sufodnfaptinstal> match
[15:31:19] <Khepra> BUT.... dd was block level, entire disk. your filesystem and actual files might be much smaller dataset than the entire disk
[15:31:21] <ede> hash is a calculation over all bits

[15:32:51] <Khepra> that's the most efficient thing you can do, that rsync check
[15:32:53] <ede> if you didn't write to either partition (mounted ro only or such) you could create a ls-lAR file listing and compare those. on cloned partitions they should be the same
[15:33:06] <sufodnfaptinstal> ede, i want to do that
[15:33:07] <ede> at least you'd be sure about filesizes
[15:33:11] <Khepra> "and compre those" that's like 99% of the problem here lol
[15:33:25] <Khepra> filesizes are likely correct, this having been a dd copy
[15:33:35] <Khepra> BITwise, it might NOT, esp. if there were "standby" interrupts

[15:34:03] <Khepra>  sufodnfaptinstal: personally? I'd just redo the clone MAKING SURE you don't get into standby again.  look into clonezilla as that apparently has data validation options
[15:34:08] <ede> if it's a bit from the metadata it could give a hint at least something isn't ok
[15:34:25] <sufodnfaptinstal> how do i do this ede?
[15:34:27] <Khepra> rsync without -c is useless to compare files bitwise

[15:35:08] <sufodnfaptinstal> since its luks2 wouldnt the whole thing just not open if there were bit level errors?

[15:35:46] <sufodnfaptinstal> i am able to get into both drives with luks2
[15:35:49] <kjetilho> sufodnfaptinstal: no, but you will get an error if you try to read files which are corrupt
[15:36:06] <kjetilho> sufodnfaptinstal: which is good, I guess.  means you won't silently use bad data
[15:36:06] <Khepra> kjetilho: only if metdata is corrupt
[15:36:19] <sufodnfaptinstal> ugh, i hate it when people tell me intelligent things which i don't like and make a lot of sense
[15:36:34] <Khepra> again, ext4 doesn't do data checksumming. if ext4 metdata is not corrupt, it won't return error on reading wrongly decrypted data

[23:02:11] <Khepra> if it's just that one screen session, the perhaps just run it with systemd-run (solution #3); because otherwise the cleanup is GoodThing(tm)
[23:04:02] <Heston> maybe start them as a different user
[23:05:18] <Portable> Starting as a different user doesn't matter, once I logout it's gone.
