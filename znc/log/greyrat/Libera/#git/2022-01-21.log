[02:42:32] <dob1> what is the difference between  git clone https://github/blablabla/projectname   and git clone git@github.com:blablabla/projectname.git  ?
[02:42:56] <imMute> dob1: the first one uses HTTPS transport, the second uses SSH.  biggest impact is how authentication is handled
[02:43:51] <dob1> imMute, right, I didn't notice it was asking for the key
[02:44:31] <imMute> yeah, for github and SSH you have to use SSH keys.   for github and HTTPS you use username/PAT (a token instead of your github password, but effecitvely the same thing)

[04:45:06] <lmat> maryo: You can't necessarily. Branches are just pointers to commits. Once branches have moved through a merge, where the branch WAS is lost. That's why you need to make sure commits hold all the meta information you need. You might say tags can also hold this informaiton, but tags are much more transient and maleable than commits.
[04:47:18] <lmat> maryo: "...via what merge method." That's not really meaningful. There's only one merge method: git merge; In your question, it sounds like you're not using git by itself, but maybe Microsoft Github or some other git host? Those hosts often add information, as rawtaz said, to the merge commits. Maybe using `git show <merge-commit-hash>;`, you can see a merge request URL or pull request URL where you can get all
[04:47:24] <lmat> the information you want?

[05:33:31] <adonis> So I checked out this source: https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/webrtc/+log/branch-heads/4664
[05:34:03] <adonis> When doing git checkout refs/branch-heads/4664 it says: error: pathspec 'refs/branch-heads/4664' did not match any file(s) known to git
[05:34:08] <adonis> why?

[05:36:46] <BtbN> It's probably gerrit crazyness as well, and not intended for use with normal tools

[11:09:54] <mehwork> is `git fetch` ever useful if my git repo is completely local / offline online (has no remote attached)?
[11:10:41] <osse> no
[11:11:06] <osse> you can use git fetch with a literal url instead of a remote name. but other than that, no.
[11:11:51] <mehwork> ok thanks
[11:12:17] <mehwork> wondered because `git fetch` outputs nothing but `git pull` tells me there's no tracking info
[11:12:38] <mehwork> seems like git fetch should do some kind of warning to say there's nothing to fetch from yet
[11:12:41] <osse> because pull = fetch + merge, and it's the merge part that needs that info
[11:12:54] <osse> yeah, that would make sense
[11:13:11] <mehwork> otherwise it's just a nop and not very helpful to a noob like me

[11:27:30] <mehwork> when `git commit --ammend` changes the commit SHA, does that technically mean it created a new commit? It's still the same _amount_ of commits. So did it just rewrite the history?
[11:28:53] <osse> yes
[11:29:13] <osse> you replace one commit with another
[11:29:24] <mehwork> i noticed i can still `git show <old commit it replaced>` though
[11:29:43] <mehwork> but git log isn't showing it anymore
[11:29:54] <mehwork> so it's a combination of creating a new commit and rewriting history?

[11:30:18] <osse> the old commit data is still lying around because git is lazy about cleaning up after itself
[11:30:28] <osse> so the data is still obtainable if you know the hash
[11:30:51] <mehwork> does it ever get cleaned up?
[11:30:51] <osse> but git log (without args) starts from the branch name, and goes from there.
[11:31:14] <osse> yes, git periodically runs 'git gc --auto' which checks if there's too much garbage
[11:31:31] *** Joins: palasso (~palasso@user/palasso)
[11:32:35] <mehwork> i just manually ran git gc --auto and it didn't clean up that old commit
[11:33:01] <osse> there's not enough garbage I guess
[11:33:23] <mehwork> interesting
[11:33:28] <osse> to clean it up you'd have to do git gc --really-delete-everything --no-i-mean-it --just-do-what-i-say

[11:33:46] <osse> (that was a joke. but git is a bit careful)
[11:34:06] <mehwork> i see
[11:35:13] <osse> in your case the old commit is still referenced by the reflog (reflog != log) so it'll be about 90 days before git starts to care
[11:35:19] <osse> !reflog
[11:35:19] <gitinfo> The git reflog (`git log -g`) temporarily (90 days by default) snapshots your branch states at each operation that changes the branch, making it easy to undo e.g. merges and rebases. The usual warnings about !rewriting/undoing history apply. See https://sukima.github.io/GitFixUm/ for full details.
[11:35:58] <osse> but if you clear the reflog and say that git should remove all unreference objects then it should get deleted

[11:56:24] <osse> there are two merges involved. git pull does one (as in it runs 'git merge')
[11:56:48] <osse> stash applies the changes you have, which can be called a merge, I guess, but it's more like applying a patch

[18:36:15] <canton7> It's cause by the fact that you said to checkout a commit hash directly: '&& git checkout ${COMMIT_SHA} \'. However, that's unrelated to the patch failing to apply
[18:37:16] <mackerman> Ask whomever wrote that patch to fix it, or fix it yourself.
[18:37:31] <canton7> It looks like your probably is just that the patch isn't applying: if this is a build system, it's probably fine and intended that you're detaching the HEAD, as you won't be making any commits
[18:38:10] <canton7> (git throws up that big warning because it's easy to accidentally lose work if you detach your HEAD and then make commits. You can silence it with 'git checkout --detach ${COMMIT_SHA}')

[20:21:47] <imMute> what works for one project might not work for another.
[20:22:52] <imMute> my personal preference is one that's like git flow but what flow calls "develop" I call "master" (or "main" now I guess).  and what flow calls "master" i don't have at all.  and hotfixes are done on the relevant release branches.

[20:23:35] <polyphem> i think open source projects prefer git flow , cause of untrusted contributors and PR with code review, whereas closed source project with trust between devs can easily use tbd , right ?
[20:24:20] <imMute> I think it's the opposite.  the git flow model seems to be focused on things that have a production environment (like websites).  most open source software is released by throwing a tarball up on the internet that others download and use
[20:24:58] <bremner> there are many ways to do code review

[20:32:35] <imMute> CD shouldn't care about your branching scheme either - you should be able to run the deployment pipeline against any branch or commit (though sanity says you should only run it against some branches)
[20:34:23] <polyphem> i realy dont't know , i stumbled upon git flow a few days ago and find it reasonable , then i watched this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lS0io4K86Y) which tells that its bad because of CI/CD stuff

[20:36:42] <imMute> ^^     and no, there are still people who use git flow.   don't be one of those people that hops on the bandwagon when it changes every 6 months
[20:37:16] <imMute> as Bjarne said:  there are two categories of programming languages [insert git branching model instead]: ones that people bitch about and ones that nobody uses.
[20:37:57] <polyphem> imMute: i thought so , how i said before i find git flow a reasonable aproach
[20:38:35] <imMute> I also find parts of it reasonable.  and if I were working on a webapp-type project, I'd probably go with git flow simply because someone put in the time to make it easy to use from the CLI
[20:39:34] <polyphem> imMute: why this constraint to webapp projects ?
[20:40:47] <imMute> I'm having a hard time coming up with a generalization of it, but basically webapps have a production service that they run.  so having CD to update that service multiple times a day/week make sense.
[20:41:06] <imMute> but for embedded projects, you don't really have that, so being able to "release" multiple times a day doesn't really make sense.
[20:41:24] <imMute> same with projects that just release libraries on the internet for other people to use: the time between releases is just typically longer
[20:42:26] <mackerman> Git flow assumes there needs to be a persistant always ready to release branch seperate from a development branch.
[20:44:13] <polyphem> mackerman: yes the main branch , that is fed from release branches that branch from develop and commit to master , right ?

[21:06:01] <mackerman> For seperate users you might put the repo not in home direcotry,  and give persmissions to everyeone who needs them.
[21:06:04] <ph88> i am already able to access the repository over https. I didn't create an new ssh user yet
[21:06:54] <ikke> ph88: Are you planning to have multiple users access repositories?
[21:07:26] <ph88> eh different developers get their own account i guess, but they can use https i guess
[21:07:55] <ikke> ph88: do they each get their own repositories, or are they going to push to shared repos?

[21:09:44] <gitinfo> Gitolite is a tool to host git repos on a server. It features fine-grained access control, custom hooks, and can be installed without root. Download: https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite Docs: http://gitolite.com/gitolite/ Quick example: http://gitolite.com/gitolite/overview/#basic-use-case
[21:10:02] <ikke> It's very easy to setup
[21:10:21] <ph88> in the docs it says git@... https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/faq/#ssh-issues  then when i look at the server /etc/passwd i don't see a git user
[21:10:54] <ph88> my boss wants me to use gitea
[21:11:00] <ikke> ah
[21:11:12] <ikke> You need to explicitly create that user
