[07:38:19] <dimadima> what kind of singing did mockturtle do
[07:38:44] <yumaikas> I was around for a while a long time ago, but am now chilling on irc because of lispgame jam, but no one is on their channel
[07:38:52] <yumaikas> Quotes form Alice in Wonderland, I think?
[07:39:14] <dimadima> i don't know what lispgame jam is
[07:39:49] <dsc_> I think technomancy was doing the lispgame jam thing?

[07:40:25] <dimadima> ah cool
[07:40:28] <yumaikas> dsc_, I wouldn't be surprised. He tends to do those alone, no?
[07:41:04] <dsc_> yumaikas: IIRC he made a programming language that can combine lua with lisp and you can make games with that
[07:41:13] <yumaikas> Fennel
[07:41:30] <dsc_> yes
[07:41:35] <yumaikas> Though he more refined one that was already existing
[07:41:44] <yumaikas> I'm working in Janet myself
[07:42:22] <yumaikas> Janet with bindings into Raylib -> Jaylib
[07:43:08] <dsc_> I barely know what Lisp is ... I stick to the easy languages :P
[07:43:47] <yumaikas> dsc_, Janet, as far as langauges go, isn't too bad, IMO
[07:44:27] <yumaikas> And I like the expression-oriented nature of it
[07:45:19] <yumaikas> Lets me write stuff like this:     (put tag-box (array/push (or (tag-box t) @[]) item))
[07:47:33] <dsc_> that just makes my brain hurts :(
[07:51:32] <imode> yumaikas: what's that do.
[07:52:33] <yumaikas> Assuming that tag-box is a dict (or table, in Janet parlance), it appends item to list in the table entry named by the value of t
[07:52:56] <yumaikas> Kinda like appending to a default-dict of string -> list ?
[07:53:20] <imode> ahhh, that's `array/push`. what's the `or`?
[07:53:20] <yumaikas> I suppose I coudl take the outer put off, since arrays are mutable in Janet
[07:53:32] <yumaikas> (or (tag-box t) @[])
[07:53:47] <yumaikas> If t isn't a valid key in tag-box, fall back to @[]
[07:54:17] <yumaikas> (Since tag-box is supposed to have lists, false isn't a valid value :D)

[07:56:01] <yumaikas> Do we get next weekend to work on this as well?

[07:57:52] <technomancy> love2d has shaders and canvases and a rotation/transform stack
[07:58:42] <yumaikas> Raylib has shaders, and can render to textures. It lacks a rotation/transform stack, but has a camera.
[07:58:53] <technomancy> ah ok I gotcha
[07:59:49] <yumaikas> (And it can rotate sprites a lot. I do kinda wish it had a better scale/rotation stack, but it's not the end of the world, heh)

[13:20:02] <fpombal> hey folks, not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I have noticed something strange on hackernews (I know there is a #hackernews channel on here but it looks dead)
[13:21:14] <fpombal> It seems that sometime between yesterday and today, a small black bar has been introduced at the top of the page. This black bar contains nothing except for a 1x1 gif: <td bgcolor="#000000"><img src="s.gif" width="0" height="5"></td>
[13:21:54] <rb> just make an Ask HN post :^)
[13:21:55] <fpombal> here is some info on it: $ sha256sum s.gif    2dfe28cbdb83f01c940de6a88ab86200154fd772d568035ac568664e52068363  s.gif

[20:19:15] <rb> there's also the issue of inner structs where the address of the struct itself is a part of the struct's type

[23:50:09] <rb> hmmm... apparently to un-compress the "huffman table", you need to create a tree, and gradually expand it, stumping out the logs for which there are codes

[23:58:29] <iDrougge> One would have to be stupid not to have it.
[23:58:30] <rb> go's defer has problems according to zig
[23:58:42] <rb> the big thing in zig is "ALL allocations are accounted for"
[23:58:48] <rb> and "you choose your allocator"
[23:58:50] <iDrougge> ISTR Go's defer being a bit backward regarding unrolling.
[23:59:16] <iDrougge> Is there any prior art to Go regarding defer?
