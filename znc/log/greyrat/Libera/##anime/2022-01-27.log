[05:43:52] <ketchupicecream> yeah
[05:43:53] <MootPoot> oh

[05:44:23] <amigojapan> Cause memo is only 4 letters
[05:44:32] <MootPoot> that's exactly what I mean
[05:44:41] <MootPoot> if they do the same thing why not get rid of !later tell
[05:44:48] <MootPoot> and make it only into !memo
[05:45:09] <amigojapan> Dunno, ask Nanobot
[05:45:23] <ketchupicecream> because of modularity?
[05:46:11] <Nanobot> "!later tell" is an alias for "!memo", because "!later tell" is how it worked on the old bot before ImoutoBot, and people were used to it.

[08:41:14] <ButterNoodle> why u cant take a 500 mag loaded for bear... into bear cuntry
[08:41:30] <MootPoot> you can take a vector if you want lmao
[08:41:46] <ButterNoodle> I'll just fly over canada screaming fu in 500 magnum on my way to alaska
[08:41:47] <ButterNoodle> :)
[08:41:49] <MootPoot> lol
[08:42:04] <MootPoot> I wonder how short of a barrel I can get on a bolt action rifle
[08:42:10] <MootPoot> a shorty bolt sounds cool
[08:42:23] <ButterNoodle> actually 460.. the shortest 500 mag I have is 8 3/8"
[08:42:43] <ButterNoodle> if the 2 3/4" 500 is ever in stock again, thats what I'll carry
[08:43:10] <MootPoot> so the smallest barrel I can have is 18.5 inches
[08:43:17] <ButterNoodle> wut
[08:43:19] <MootPoot> does anybody make a barrel that short
[08:43:34] <ButterNoodle> u can get 16" all day long
[08:43:55] <MootPoot> well, you can get shorter its just that it falls into the restricted category
[08:44:01] <ButterNoodle> if u want a yucky remmington 700.. they have the xcr tactical in 308
[08:44:04] <MootPoot> basically means cant use it anywhere execpt for a rnage
[08:44:08] <MootPoot> range*
[08:44:39] <ButterNoodle> yea we have that brain dead mentality here.. shorter barrel means more deadly or something illogical
[08:45:11] <MootPoot> 19" is pretty manageable imo

[08:47:02] <ButterNoodle> 300 win mag
[08:47:10] <ButterNoodle> ^^
[08:47:12] <MootPoot> 30-06 is too much for me
[08:47:16] <MootPoot> is that more beef then that
[08:47:23] <ButterNoodle> :|
[08:47:32] <ButterNoodle> quite
[08:47:35] <MootPoot> might be because of the stock though
[08:47:42] <ButterNoodle> yea
[08:47:43] <MootPoot> the stock on the rifle I use is shit
[08:47:54] <ButterNoodle> get a good stock and integrated break and it will feel like 308
[08:48:07] <MootPoot> never tried anything bigger then 7.62x39 in a modern rifle
[08:48:09] <MootPoot> with a good stock
[08:48:22] <ButterNoodle> cz, tikka, browning all make good 300 win mags
[08:48:56] <ButterNoodle> and as far as unicorn hunting ammo 300 win mag is probably going to be just as available as 308 in performance hunting cartridges
[08:49:09] <ButterNoodle> its been around for 30-40 years
[08:49:29] <MootPoot> I could do .243 win
[08:49:35] <MootPoot> its easy to find at the store
[08:49:48] <MootPoot> .243 win with a shorty barrel
[08:49:58] <ButterNoodle> the next hop up to 300 RUM only gives u a lil more punch at the cost of more barrel wear and a bruised shoulder
[08:50:06] <ButterNoodle> 243 eats barrels too
[08:50:13] <MootPoot> it does?
[08:50:17] <MootPoot> uhh
[08:50:18] <ButterNoodle> its a screamer
[08:50:22] <MootPoot> .270?
[08:50:43] <ButterNoodle> for sure 270
[08:50:51] <ButterNoodle> 243 is up there
[08:51:00] <MootPoot> what do you mean by eats barrels
[08:51:06] <MootPoot> are we talking like new barrel after 3000 rounds?
[08:51:10] <MootPoot> or new after 500
[08:51:28] <MootPoot> I know smaller stuff like .223 can go like 10k ez
[08:51:50] <ButterNoodle> 300 RUM is probably 1500.. then 270 ~ 2000..
[08:52:04] <ButterNoodle> 243 after that.. idk what round count tho
[08:52:04] <MootPoot> I can deal with 2000 rounds
[08:52:13] <MootPoot> how much is it to replace a barrel?
[08:52:26] <ButterNoodle> 300 WM is 4-5000 rounds
[08:52:50] <ButterNoodle> well that depends.. if ur replacing get a match barrel and pay 500-1000
[08:52:53] <ButterNoodle> depending
[08:53:06] <MootPoot> nah
[08:53:11] <MootPoot> I just wanna go deer huntin
[08:53:17] <MootPoot> ez keto or someth idk
[08:53:17] <ButterNoodle> unless ur invested in the action and stock.. just sell and replace
[08:53:31] <ButterNoodle> #metoo
[08:53:37] <MootPoot> selling and replacing sounds fine, I doubt I'll put that many rounds through it though
[08:53:39] <ButterNoodle> I gotta scope my 300 wm
[08:53:40] <MootPoot> maybe like 20-30 a year
[08:54:00] <ButterNoodle> thats the good part about a hunting only rifle.. a few rounds to check zero
[08:54:13] <ButterNoodle> a few round to get some meat

[08:58:28] <MootPoot> I used a guys 10/22 with irons on it
[08:58:34] <ButterNoodle> for?
[08:58:40] <MootPoot> jfc rifles are so easy to handle when there are no optics
[08:58:56] <MootPoot> it was at that training course thing I took a while ago
[08:59:02] <ButterNoodle> ic
[08:59:09] <ButterNoodle> yea good irons are nice
[08:59:11] <MootPoot> kinda makes me appreciate the value of a lighter rifle

[09:00:13] <ButterNoodle> again.. u need good ammo
[09:00:16] <MootPoot> probably the most powerful rifle I have
[09:00:26] <ButterNoodle> idk if they make jacketed hps for that
[09:00:30] <MootPoot> nah
[09:00:46] <MootPoot> all these old commie rounds - basically  unless you make your own, all you have is FMJ and SP
[09:00:52] <MootPoot> same with 7.62x39
[09:00:53] <ButterNoodle> yuck
[09:01:09] <ButterNoodle> someone was loading 7.62 in hunting here at one point
[09:01:16] <ButterNoodle> with ammo shortage tho
[09:01:31] <MootPoot> lol, its only you guys
[09:01:33] <ButterNoodle> if it aint 9mm or 223.. its probably out of stock
[09:01:44] <MootPoot> I can get 7.62 for days from the ruskis or the chinese

[09:04:33] <MootPoot> semi auto 308 win for about 1600 USD - 20" barrel
[09:04:59] <ButterNoodle> I have an ar10.. dont really care about another semi 308

[09:05:56] <MootPoot> 1500 usd 
[09:05:58] <MootPoot> same thing
[09:06:10] <ButterNoodle> and if I'm spending $2 a round.. I want it to feel like I'm spending $2 a round.. like 500 magnum :p
[09:06:19] <ButterNoodle> I do want that benelli m4
[09:06:22] <ButterNoodle> for some reason
[09:06:27] <ButterNoodle> again
[09:06:35] <ButterNoodle> 1600 for a plastic shotgun tho
[09:06:49] <MootPoot> although I was wondering about getting a savage 12 FV 
[09:06:55] <MootPoot> not too expensive
[09:07:09] <ButterNoodle> meh, I have an ithaca 29
[09:07:14] <ButterNoodle> good enough
[09:07:18] <ButterNoodle> would like an auto
[09:08:30] <MootPoot> I want that savage straight pull
[09:08:35] <MootPoot> short pp barrel
[09:08:45] <ButterNoodle> I think aside from mount and glass for that x-bolt, I'm spent out for a while
[09:08:55] <MootPoot> although with 19" barrel I'd have to make my own ammo?
[09:08:57] <ButterNoodle> I do like those straight pulls
[09:09:17] <MootPoot> since I'd be having a lot of ammo yeeted out the end of the barrel

[12:30:26] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I started drinking instant coffee, it's much cheaper
[12:30:26] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: Are you also an enjoyer of coffee?
[12:30:52] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: That is odd, here it is much cheaper to buy the beans and grind them yourself.

[12:31:38] <HubertFarnsworth> oh yes KatrinValerie, coffee daisuki
[12:32:08] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: I am comparing it to spending 2usd on a cup of coffee at 7 11
[12:32:19] <KatrinValerie> Did you know that there's now coffee bean brands that ship their beans via Sailing cargo ships?
[12:32:30] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: oh, that makes sense
[12:32:59] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: you should try brewing fresh coffee, it is so much better than store bought or instant
[12:33:25] <KatrinValerie> If you do not drink coffee often, you can get a handmill and just grind as much as you need for a single brewing.
[12:33:49] <amigojapan> KatrinValerie: the 2usd coffee is freshly brewed and grinded by the machine
[12:34:06] <KatrinValerie> Handbrewing coffee has something meditative and you don't need to buy anything expensive for it
[12:34:40] <KatrinValerie> amigojapan: Yeah, you can have better coffee for a few cents at home. The beans don't stay fresh for long in those coffee automata.
[12:35:03] <KatrinValerie> They have to be stored properly sealed.
[12:35:15] <HubertFarnsworth> insta coffee? ouch amigojapan 
[12:35:19] <KatrinValerie> Also you can enjoy it in the warmth of your own home.

[12:58:21] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: I love how life counter intuitively increases entropy
[12:58:42] <KatrinValerie> What seems like order to us humans is really disorder in the bigger picture of the universe
[12:58:55] <KatrinValerie> Meow
[12:59:50] <ketchupicecream> heat death when
[13:00:15] <KatrinValerie> I think that the game of life is actually a very good abstract representation of how a universe could potentially work
[13:00:35] <KatrinValerie> We see that certain sets of rules will lead to increadibly abstract things forming
[13:00:50] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: there is only one kind of energy that can overcome the power of the second law of thermodynamics, the energy of horny
[13:00:50] <KatrinValerie> And there's a cross section with fractals as well
[13:01:05] <KatrinValerie> The self similarities we see in nature also imply that the universe has a fractale nature
[13:01:15] <HubertFarnsworth> everything increases entropy KatrinValerie 
[13:01:47] <KatrinValerie> And once you realize that we are all part of one huge trippy fractal, life doesn't seem so bad.

[13:20:24] <MootPoot> wtf is wrong with you
[13:20:49] <ketchupicecream> amigojapan: apparently the pressure in making espresso makes it taste different than filter coffe
[13:21:04] <MootPoot> espresso is extremely fine grind and then pressure is used

[13:24:26] <MootPoot> last time I asked for a americano they gave me drip coffee

[13:25:37] <MootPoot> but it was a coffee shop in chinatown
[13:25:46] <MootPoot> so maybe they just took it to mean the same thing
[13:26:17] <emmeka> MootPoot a caffe americano is just espresso with water added to make it "like" American coffee. It was created when Americans went to Italy and wanted "a coffee", so the Italians were like here this roughly approximates the piss you drink
[13:26:27] <MootPoot> lol
[13:26:31] <emmeka> and then somehow, this got imported here as something fancy
[13:26:37] <ketchupicecream> amigojapan: that's called black coffee

[21:42:19] <ButterNoodle> esx is a bit more picky
[21:45:30] <Macer> it is.. maybe passthrough to a VM. i dont think esx does containers
