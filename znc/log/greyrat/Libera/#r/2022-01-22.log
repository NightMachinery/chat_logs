[00:17:06] <fltrz> hmm I have a graphics API version mismatch when I try to run ggplot(); something something screenwidth  RK() 
[00:17:25] <fltrz> R was installed yesterday, and ggplot half an hour ago
[00:18:17] <fendur> how did you install ggplot?
[00:18:45] <fltrz> note that I run arch linux, so R version is R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01); ggplot was installed as install.packages('ggplot2')
[00:19:04] <fltrz> is it possible that R is too new for the ggplot2 package?
[00:19:37] <fendur> i think R would have told you that when you tried to install ggplot2
[00:20:02] <fendur> but it's still plausible
[00:21:44] <fltrz> what is the RK() package anyway?
[00:22:02] <fendur> i don't know :/
[00:26:42] <fltrz> rk.screendevice.width and rk.screendevice.height indeed don't exist... but rk.screendevice does
[00:26:52] <fltrz> sorry rk.screen.device does
[00:32:39] <fltrz> how do I clear the cache? https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/pull/4117
[00:35:39] <fltrz> how do I get a stack trace or step into the call with R debugger in rwkward?
[00:38:22] <fltrz> is there an IRC channel of R developers?
[00:47:04] <fltrz> 'lib = "/usr/lib/R/library"' is not writable
[00:47:30] <fltrz> 'lib = "/usr/lib/R/library"' is not writable'lib = "/usr/lib/R/library"' is not writable 
[00:48:09] <fltrz> 'lib = "/usr/lib/R/library"' is not writable \n Would you like to use a personal library instead? (yes/No/cancel) yes <== may this be the cause?
[00:48:21] <fltrz> sorry ignore first 2 lines
[00:52:47] <confuzeus> may be. R will use the most recent library though
[00:53:09] <twrk> mmm a stack trace with traceback(), which will print the last error's trace. see what .libPaths() outputs to see from where libs will be found
[00:54:04] <confuzeus> if you want to install/update in /usr/lib/R/library you should sudo into R (i.e. sudo R, then install/update)
[00:54:08] <twrk> to clear the workspace, rm(list = ls(all.names = TRUE))
[00:55:06] <twrk> yeah and since `sudo R` would be using the root user, and I doubt there's a /.Rprofile file, so nothing would be preloaded
[00:58:43] <twrk> supposedly you can debug with a call to browser(), but I haven't used it :>
[01:03:12] <twrk> as for an irc channel for r-devel... ¯\(°_o)/¯
[01:30:44] <fltrz> confuzeus: the arch linux R page says to install "system packages" (I guess it means the ones that start with r- on AUR) through pacman, and the others through R package management... so I effed that up. using sudo might result in the same as I have now.
[01:31:45] <fltrz> how do I uninstall all packages within R? I see remove.packages() but not sure how to indicate all
[01:32:13] <fltrz> can I safely just uninstall R, remove the userspace library, then reinstall R for the same result?
[01:37:29] <confuzeus> yes. i install r-base, r-base-dev and let the system handle all the installation issues. then, install.packages() for all other libraries
[01:51:45] <confuzeus> also, you should not need to install packages via "sudo R;  install.packages()" as that is not good idea. i only use sudo R it to update "system packages" (i.e. when r-cran-* are not updated fast enough by the system package manager)
[02:28:37] <fltrz> confuzeus: when you install r-base and r-base-dev, is that through AUR or default repos? or thats on debian/ubuntu?

[04:03:26] <fltrz> so the problem turns out to only occur in rkward, and not on jupyterlab... spent like a whole day trying AUR packages etc instead of internal CRAN...
[04:09:21] <fltrz> and now I find that the keywords 'rkward ggplot2 graphics version mismatch' give me a correct resolution

[11:14:12] <confuzeus> fltrz: lol, i only installed archlinux once, just for the vibes that "i installed arch". i use ubuntu. the system packages are ubuntu but thought there would be similarly named ones in archlinux. do you get the same error not using a gui? rkward is a competitor rstudio, the ggplot2 developers. they prolly want you to ggplot2 with rstudio

[21:58:16] <CuriousErnestBro> already use rmarkdown
[21:58:29] <CuriousErnestBro> and hack together stuff with ggplot2 
[22:03:04] <confuzeus> you should put skills that you have (i.e. skills you can demonstrate in an assessment).

[22:11:41] <twrk> and since R is generally associated with data analysis, I guess you might have the luxury to be able to focus on certain parts (like plotting and rmarkdown for reporting... as opposed to collecting and "wrangling")
