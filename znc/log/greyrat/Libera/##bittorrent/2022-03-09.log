[06:28:51] <rocket_fuel> is there such a thing as "dynamic" torrents? e.g. files that would be added later, as they become available? or modify existing files?
[07:20:11] <TheSHADOW> Not really, no.
[07:20:28] <TheSHADOW> It's a popular request but the way you'd have to implement it would be weird.
[07:20:44] <TheSHADOW> Better to refresh a .torrent via rss or whichever.
[07:44:33] <DeHackEd> yeah, how do you authenticate what the new download contents should be if they don't exist yet? signed torrent files which contain public keys for later verification?
[07:48:36] <TheSHADOW> That's what you'd need to do.
[07:49:10] <TheSHADOW> So instead of writing something custom, just fetch new torrent or hash from rss via https.

[18:19:48] <rocket_fuel> maybe just one single public key, associated with the original torrent file, and additional files signed by that same key, can be added in the future?
[18:24:27] <DeHackEd> my point was that some form of verification would be needed in the .torrent file able to safely predict/verify a replacement torrent. if you want the client itself to do that. the counter-argument is this isn't the client's job
