[00:09:11] <isekaijin> want*
[00:11:56] <TsundereNoises> because she wants to be a sexy onee-san, but her daughteru energy is too strong

[00:28:39] <Roey> & Also, are there any animes with non-"white" leads?
[00:28:45] <Roey> like, Indian or Black, etc.
[00:29:30] <Roey> saying "white" because anime in general reflects how Japanese sentiments view Western culture

[00:45:39] <TsundereNoises> Roey: even high school algebra is generally presented terribly in anime, but college-level math doesn't tend to be presented well in ANY media, and I'm not sure that's even really possible without making it suck narratively

[00:46:50] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: It's packaged for Debian & Raspbian though, so I feel is must ask: but why?
[00:47:19] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Also, Guix works on other distros than Guix System and falls back to automatically compiling things in the background when binary packages are unavailable in it.
[00:47:43] <MootPoot> I was just trying to figure out how to compile things
[00:47:47] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I don't recommend compiling much on a Pi, mainly because they're kinda weak as machines and it'd take ages.
[00:48:43] <MootPoot> here I was about to compile chromium on it
[00:49:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Right. So. Don't ever try to compile chrom* or firefox. They're notoriously bad about compile time and required memory.
[00:49:28] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They're flatly infamous for how bad they are.
[00:49:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> And not just on a Pi. At all.
[00:50:12] <Aurora_v_kosmose> MootPoot: Even on my machine, I'd need to toggle low-memory mode (on a 32GB machine) just to ensure it doesn't run out.

[04:52:34] <MootPoot> they all have carbs in them
[04:52:39] <ButterNoodle> or take capsules if u dont like the taste
[04:52:48] <ButterNoodle> its the price you pay to poop
[04:52:50] <MootPoot> if I get the water insoluble ones
[04:52:55] <MootPoot> will that work
[04:53:08] <MootPoot> without adding carbs even though its still listed as carbs
[04:53:18] <ButterNoodle> thing about net carbs
[04:53:38] <ButterNoodle> carbs - fiber
[04:53:45] <ButterNoodle> it cheats
[04:54:16] <MootPoot> so fiber are carbs but fiber dosent get digested
[04:54:21] <MootPoot> so it dosen't matter?
[04:54:41] <ButterNoodle> in reality sugar free metamucil has 3g of carbs.. but all nondigestable fiber so.. 0
[04:54:48] <ButterNoodle> nope
[04:54:49] <ButterNoodle> doesnt matter
[04:54:55] <ButterNoodle> *net carbs always
[04:55:02] <ButterNoodle> I'd be fucked
[04:55:28] <ButterNoodle> my keto bread is 1g net carbs.. but 15g of carbs
[04:55:29] <MootPoot> my shits have been a pain recently
[04:55:33] <ButterNoodle> yea
[04:55:43] <ButterNoodle> shits on keto are shit
[04:55:59] <MootPoot> inulin or husk 
[04:56:01] <ButterNoodle> I have been taking fiber for a long time anyway tho
[04:56:06] <ButterNoodle> ?
[04:56:33] <ButterNoodle> since atkins was a thing.. like 15 years a go
[04:56:50] <MootPoot> I was about to just go for a walk and get some - wondering to get inulin ( insluble fiber ) or psyliium husk ( soluble )
[04:57:14] <ButterNoodle> the sugar free metamucil is psyliium
[04:57:22] <ButterNoodle> have had no issues w that
[04:57:46] <ButterNoodle> *either will work tbh
[04:59:19] <MootPoot> ok
[04:59:27] <MootPoot> I cheated on my diet yesterday - kinda
[04:59:32] <MootPoot> was starving at 2am
[04:59:50] <MootPoot> went to the drive though and got 2 burgers - lettuce wrapped though so only like 15g carbs
[04:59:59] <MootPoot> I cheated on calories - should be good for keto still
[05:01:57] <MootPoot> I think I ate 300 calories more then I was supposed to

[05:09:26] <Roey> (it is)
[05:09:28] <MootPoot> we can but 
[05:09:34] <MootPoot> we  need to fill up on protien

[05:09:47] <MootPoot> that's what keto is
[05:10:00] <MootPoot> fat and protien diet
[05:10:04] <Roey> Keto is a method of dehydration leading to water weight loss
[05:10:08] <Roey> yeah
[05:10:09] <Roey> and you know what
[05:10:12] <Roey> yolu still need fiber
[05:10:16] <Roey> you*
[05:10:18] <MootPoot> and?
[05:10:30] <Roey> kale not pills
[05:10:48] <MootPoot> why should I get kale over pills
[05:10:49] <Roey> I see lots of keto types eating kale all the time
[05:10:54] <MootPoot> pills dont go bad in a week
[05:10:57] <Roey> because kale comes with other phytonutrinets as wlel
[05:11:22] <Roey> MootPoot: well you see the point of buying the kale is to eat it, not to leave it in the back of the fridge to be forgotten
[05:11:39] <MootPoot> that still dosen't solve the problem
[05:11:43] <Roey> sure does.
[05:11:46] <MootPoot> that you have to go to the store and get fresh kale
[05:11:47] <Roey> the problem's in your head
[05:11:50] <MootPoot> constantly
[05:12:01] <Roey> MootPoot: at the point that you go to buy groceries, you can certainly get it
[05:12:12] <MootPoot> rather then just getting a box of husk or something and never bother again
[05:12:13] <Roey> and also, as  a cruciferous vegetable, kale holds up pretty long
[05:12:24] <MootPoot> Roey: I go to the grocery store like two times a month
[05:12:53] <MootPoot> but anyway - I already take some general multivitamins anyway 
[05:13:04] <MootPoot> I only see disadvantages of kale from your presentation
[05:14:35] <MootPoot> aside from the vitamin thin
[05:14:46] <Roey> yeah
[05:14:52] <Roey> kale holds up > 2 weeks easily.
[05:14:52] <MootPoot> but kale dosen't supply everything I need anyway on its own - I still need the multi pill
[05:14:58] <MootPoot> so the point is moot
[05:15:11] <Roey> what does kale "not [provide"?
[05:16:20] <MootPoot> does it?
[05:16:33] <MootPoot> just a bundle of kale provide everything you need
[05:17:02] <MootPoot> Goddamn that price
[05:17:06] <Roey> yeah vegetables are kinda magical like that
[05:17:10] <Roey> and it's cheap AF.
[05:17:23] <MootPoot> where do you live?
[05:17:32] <MootPoot> its 2 dollars for one little bundle here
[05:17:45] <MootPoot> its expensive, not cheap
[05:19:45] <MootPoot> so what I'm seeing here is that its a equivalent but significantly more expensive
[05:22:31] <MootPoot> but anyway, I used to be basically vegetarian-I dont have a issue with veggies and shit - It just dosen't work for me as well as this does

[06:32:34] <MootPoot> and only 13 people
[06:32:35] <MootPoot> damn
[06:32:41] <ButterNoodle> kinda like Mrs-ButterNoodle-v2
[06:32:57] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: u could literally take u pants of and watch it
[06:33:30] <TsundereNoises> the new model is going to be much smaller right?
[06:33:54] <ButterNoodle> yes.. and a newer model year
[06:34:08] <ButterNoodle> looking for a japanese import
[06:34:33] <TsundereNoises> lol
[06:35:26] <ButterNoodle> *Well off, well endowed, otaku from Texas looking for cute japanese girl for LTR and procreation. inquire within
[06:36:03] <TsundereNoises> are you already "from" texas?
[06:36:06] <TsundereNoises> that was fast
[06:36:17] <ButterNoodle> *not yet
[06:36:19] <TsundereNoises> or just no one wants to put "from ohio" on their resume
[06:36:31] <ButterNoodle> ^indiana
[06:36:34] <TsundereNoises> same thing
[06:36:41] <ButterNoodle> u wanna fight
[06:37:36] <ButterNoodle> because the only thing ohio is good for is good morning... the rest is shit
[06:37:42] <TsundereNoises> my first mental association with Ohio is pulling over at a rest stop and finding aggressive geese in the bathroom, my mental association with Indiana is "I know, logically, I must have driven through it between the shitty goose bathroom in Ohio and when I got to Chicago, but fuck if I remember it"
[06:38:08] <ButterNoodle> yea thats north indiana.. I dont like those people

[06:38:33] <TsundereNoises> might technically be better than the toilet geese
[06:38:35] <ButterNoodle> they might as well be from ohio
[06:38:54] <ButterNoodle> in chicago the geese are armed and sportin colors
[06:39:13] <TsundereNoises> yes, although unlike most gang activity, I'm not sure it makes the geese any more violent
[06:39:40] <ButterNoodle> ikrite.. they just participate in more organized attacks
[06:40:25] <TsundereNoises> those fuckin' geese come down from canada
[06:40:27] <TsundereNoises> we should build a wall
[06:40:36] <ButterNoodle> *they would fly over it
[06:40:42] <ButterNoodle> sentinal
[06:40:45] <MootPoot> Thank god for DCHP reservations
[06:40:51] <MootPoot> FUCK static ips
[06:40:52] <ButterNoodle> and feed the homeless with the corpses
[06:40:54] <MootPoot> such a pain
[06:41:02] <ButterNoodle> tf are u doing MootPoot
[06:41:33] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: every time I turn on my printer and it connects to wifi  - changes its ip due to DCHP and then computer driver is like wtf- where printer ??? 
[06:41:44] <MootPoot> Reserving a spcific IP for it seems to have fixed it in the router
[06:41:49] <MootPoot> printing dosent break anymore
[06:41:52] <TsundereNoises> deer too, I really like the idea of actually having some kind of gubbmint deer buying program, make venison sausages for the homeless, pay hunter, don't limit deer per season
[06:41:55] <TsundereNoises> we have too many damn deer
[06:41:58] <ButterNoodle> tf dhcp are you using
[06:42:13] <MootPoot> just my router's control panel
[06:42:17] <MootPoot> TP link thingy
[06:42:25] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: #heretoo soo much deer chum on the interstate
[06:42:31] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: thats dog shit dhcp
[06:42:38] <ButterNoodle> run dhcpd on linux
[06:42:59] <ButterNoodle> I mean w/e u already have a fix
[06:43:29] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: the only thing we have had support for is coyote and fox bounties
[06:43:35] <MootPoot> yeah idk if its a normal thing or not
[06:43:55] <MootPoot> but it just records the MAC address and then everytime it connects it always gives it the same IP
[06:44:00] <ButterNoodle> 99% of the time dhcpd will just renew the same ip.. not toss it back in the pool
[06:44:05] <MootPoot> is that a typical feature in most systems
[06:44:12] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: you really have that many foxes?
[06:44:17] <ButterNoodle> use to
[06:44:19] <MootPoot> Kitsune JK
[06:44:35] <ButterNoodle> I had on show up on my back deck not to long ago and eat cat food
[06:44:47] <ButterNoodle> large fella
[06:44:51] <TsundereNoises> I mean I've had all kind s of animals around like that
[06:44:58] <TsundereNoises> everyone loves catfood!
[06:45:03] <ButterNoodle> we dont have a fox problem now...
[06:45:22] <ButterNoodle> coyotes.. they are everywhere
[06:45:50] <ButterNoodle> a hs friend hunts them.. he fills a full sized truck bead with them in a night
[06:46:27] <TsundereNoises> my only hesitation with that is, at least here, we need to protect the wolves. Not sure if they're still officially endangered or not, but we definitely have too few of them and they'd be good for the ecosystem
[06:46:30] <ButterNoodle> I believe it was a coyote that killed my neighbors cat that he abandoned and left outside
[06:46:40] <TsundereNoises> and not enough people pay attention to differences
[06:46:44] <ButterNoodle> tru
[06:46:54] <TsundereNoises> I know it's illeagal to shoot wolves here, but it happens a lot
[06:46:56] <ButterNoodle> and the coyotes here are as big as small wolves
[06:47:25] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: weird thing - it seems to be linked to the frequency of connection
[06:47:33] <TsundereNoises> at that size are they big enough to take down bigger animals (like deer?) or do they just hunt cats and raccoons and shit still
[06:47:46] <MootPoot> So it'll always give my phone the same IP since it connects and disconnects daily 
[06:47:52] <ButterNoodle> we dont have very many wolves in indiana..
[06:47:58] <MootPoot> But the printer gets turned on like once every month 
[06:48:02] <MootPoot> So it gets a new one 
[06:48:04] <MootPoot> Dunno y
[06:48:29] <ButterNoodle> yea is a dogshit dhcpd on the tp.. it sees the device offline and just tombstones the lease
[06:48:40] <ButterNoodle> or.. just doesnt see it ack for x amount of time
[06:48:59] <MootPoot> Do better ones just hold on forever? 
[06:49:04] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: I can't remember which state it was, but for a while according to state governments there were officially some few wolves in like VT and ME, but not NH or something
[06:49:09] <ButterNoodle> I mean u could set lease time to 90 days or something
[06:49:10] <TsundereNoises> like they see the NH border and just stop
[06:49:28] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I think there is a setting for that just left it at default
[06:49:41] <ButterNoodle> we dont have any really here.. they are just coming over from other states
[06:49:59] <ButterNoodle> MootPoot: yea that may be ur fix long term.. just set that to 60 or 90 days
[06:50:01] <TsundereNoises> there are a couple killed most years I think, so presumably more that aren't
[06:50:12] <TsundereNoises> not many though
[06:50:31] <ButterNoodle> the reason ud want it low.. is if u may exceed the scope size with new devices in the lease time
[06:51:00] <ButterNoodle> most of the time its a /24.. and u aint addin 254 new devices on ur home network in a month probably
[06:51:28] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: I havent heard or seen any killed in indiana.. there are severe penalties made public over it
[06:51:45] <ButterNoodle> even tho.. if its killing livestock all bets are off
[06:52:06] <ButterNoodle> but wolves are big animals.. if they are getting ur chickens... fix ur shit
[06:52:47] <ButterNoodle> speaking of livestock.. I gotta feed my cats
[06:52:48] <ButterNoodle> brb
[06:53:04] <MootPoot> gonna fill that pussy with MEAT
[06:53:35] <TsundereNoises> ButterNoodle: yeah, penalties here too, so usually people try not to get caught
[06:54:11] <TsundereNoises> it's sad, my dad used to have ducks and they all killed
[06:54:13] <TsundereNoises> by a bear though

[06:57:22] <TsundereNoises> I'm having decaf tea
[06:58:19] <MootPoot> amigojapan: I'm going to go watch Dune in cinema in an hour
[06:58:30] <MootPoot> there are only 14/400 seats used
[06:58:34] <MootPoot> nice and empty
[06:58:47] <amigojapan> Tomako is pissed off at our son. And we need to sign a paper so he has a place to stay between going into the dorm and graduation from the government facility, and she does not want us to sign
[06:59:00] <MootPoot> why is she mad?
[06:59:05] <amigojapan> Very nice MootPoot 
[06:59:44] <amigojapan> MootPoot: cause our son has blocked her phone calls
[07:00:01] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: he's not going to stay with you?
[07:00:13] <TsundereNoises> and what happens if you don't sign?
[07:00:14] <amigojapan> No TsundereNoises 
[07:00:39] <TsundereNoises> how old is he now anyway?
[07:00:54] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: he may have no home till he can go into the dorm. I don't know
[07:01:20] <amigojapan> This is tomako's ÁôáÁô™
[07:01:22] <TsundereNoises> like they just kick him out on the street because his parents (who don't have custody) don't sign a form?
[07:01:41] <amigojapan> He will be 18 in December
[07:02:03] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: that's what I fear
[07:02:26] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: is 18 age of adulthood in japan?
[07:02:31] <TsundereNoises> for like contracts and stuff?
[07:02:34] <TsundereNoises> or is it 20
[07:03:06] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: it just turned to 18
[07:03:20] <amigojapan> Before it was 20
[07:03:43] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: so in that case, can't he legally get a job and an apartment without your consent?
[07:04:26] <amigojapan> Yeah TsundereNoises he can, but that's really expresive
[07:04:45] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: and can be solved by signing a paper
[07:05:46] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: he graduates on march and enters the dorm April
[07:06:00] <amigojapan> It's just a months problem
[07:06:53] <amigojapan> Oh my mistake
[07:07:24] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: he turns 18 next month, so he needs a place to stay till April
[07:08:35] <TsundereNoises> I mean, I feel like this isn't as big a problem as if he were younger
[07:08:58] <TsundereNoises> call him up, tell him he has 2 choices, apologize to his mom, or go find a job and an apartment

[07:23:30] <ButterNoodle> *supposedly
[07:23:41] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: renting an apartment can cost several months with of rent which you don't get back and since he will have the dorm soon staying at a hostel would be easy cheaper
[07:23:57] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: you don't get refunded if you don't damage the property?
[07:24:06] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: he will not stay with you, or can he
[07:24:11] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: there's just like a few months rent extra cost?
[07:24:18] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: key money is not refundable

[07:31:10] <ButterNoodle> there is a time for that TsundereNoises...
[07:31:23] <ButterNoodle> and the time when ur kid is being an edgy lil shit is not it..
[07:31:40] <ButterNoodle> like when my son fucked up and hung around the bad crowd
[07:32:25] <ButterNoodle> and I had to field a certain gov agency that was looking for him.. because his id was used to pawn some stolen stuff that traced back to stolen automatic weapons
[07:32:25] <TsundereNoises> as an adult I haven't dealt with kids older than 12 thus far (my older niece)
[07:32:28] <TsundereNoises> fucking teenagers
[07:32:31] <TsundereNoises> I'm afraid of that
[07:32:38] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: how old is your son?
[07:32:47] <ButterNoodle> late 20s now
[07:32:54] <amigojapan> I see

[07:33:46] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: Sadale said I was the first to have a child in this channel. But I think you best me
[07:33:48] <ButterNoodle> so.. many years after that was dealt with.. him not having to sit in an interrigation room because of my wits.. I told him they were going to get a court order for his dna.. and how serious he fucked up hanging with those people
[07:33:57] <ButterNoodle> TsundereNoises: naa a different one..
[07:34:14] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: he came with the wife
[07:34:21] <ButterNoodle> was already 5 when we met
[07:34:28] <ButterNoodle> but my daughter is older than ur son
[07:34:37] <ButterNoodle> she just turned 19 recently
[07:35:08] <ButterNoodle> ahh yes
[07:35:19] <amigojapan> Ah ok ButterNoodle

[07:36:14] <ButterNoodle> it was a hard day at work.. and my wife greeted me in the best possible way after a rough day.. and an evening we had to spend with family for the sons birthday
[07:36:21] <ButterNoodle> pretty sure that was the day
[07:36:55] <ButterNoodle> early 2002
[07:37:32] <ButterNoodle> I need to make a few more kids.. so I have better choices for favorite kid :|
[07:37:34] <ButterNoodle> anyway
[07:37:42] <DunceCotus> get married, get children, get old, get REBORNSED
[07:38:25] <ButterNoodle> my conscious wouldnt let my kid be homeless bc of a paper needing to be signed.. I'd tell my wife to fuck off w that noise.. but ur situation is different
[07:39:04] <DunceCotus> worst comes to worst there's always Neverland

[10:36:39] <amigojapan> TsundereNoises: I like the word "gall" as guys/galls
[10:37:20] <TsundereNoises> amigojapan: it'd be spelled "gal" with just the one l in english
[10:37:34] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[10:38:05] <TsundereNoises> gall with 2 ls is like when something irritates you
[10:38:09] <TsundereNoises> "that really galls me"

[10:38:26] <amigojapan> Brb
[10:38:35] <TsundereNoises> not a super common word, but the title is one of those ones that doesn't make sense in eglish
[10:38:40] <TsundereNoises> like Attack on Titan
[10:46:20] <tcsilver> or it can mean nerve "you've got some gall"

[12:13:36] <MootPoot> wym official
[12:13:39] <hassoon> dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooods
[12:13:48] <MootPoot> how the fuck do I find a file in command line
[12:13:54] <MootPoot> the find command dosen't do shit
[12:14:18] <hassoon> it does
[12:14:22] <hassoon> you don't know how to use it 
[12:14:40] <hassoon> rtfm MootPoot 
[12:15:11] <MootPoot> The manual is trash 
[12:16:26] <MootPoot> What does it mean when you type in a command and the terminal just goes to the next line 
[12:16:33] <MootPoot> Like if you pressed enter 
[12:16:45] <mexen> try locate
[12:16:47] <MootPoot> No output, no status, no error 
[12:17:18] <mexen> it's waiting for context - it means you haven't entered a complete command
[12:17:35] <hassoon> MootPoot: aaaaaa shar'ap
[12:17:48] * hassoon slaps MootPoot with the find manual
[12:17:51] <mexen> if each line is preceded by > anyway
[12:17:56] <hassoon> printed on a book
[12:18:02] * MootPoot throws away the manual 
[12:18:10] <mexen> if it's just blank, then something's well hang like me
[12:18:22] <mexen> just <ctrl c> or <ctrl z>
[12:18:40] <MootPoot> No, it, it just goes to the next >
[12:18:55] <mexen> I have to say though, every time I use find, I always run `man find`
[12:19:01] <mexen> OK, if there are >s
[12:19:15] <mexen> Then it means your context is incomplete
[12:19:38] <mexen> like if you adding two numbers but you type `a +` then hit enter
[12:19:39] <MootPoot> So a incomplete command should come back with an error message saying missing argument or something
[12:19:49] <MootPoot> Why is it blank 
[12:19:49] <mexen> no, not exactly
[12:20:18] <MootPoot> If a bit is missing, it should say a bit is missing 
[12:20:54] <mexen> not exactly, not when what you have is already syntactically correct. It's just incomplete
[12:21:06] <mexen> what command? paste it here
[12:21:16] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I meant to say the first dune movie
[12:21:33] <MootPoot> The 80s one 
[12:21:49] <amigojapan> MootPoot the actor of Captain Picard appears in that
[12:21:54] <amigojapan> Yeah
[12:23:03] <MootPoot> mexen:   sudo find . -name octoprint-wpa-supplicant.txt
[12:23:39] <MootPoot> amigojapan: nah, I didn't watch the original
[12:23:46] <MootPoot> never even knew it existed before this actually
[12:24:02] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I see
[12:25:10] <mexen> OK MootPoot  that seems pretty standard to me. If that txt exists, it's your output. If it's not in that location, you get no output and your normal cursour

[12:27:39] <mexen> `man find` LOOOOOOOOOOOOL

[17:33:00] <amigojapan> Jesse do you mean a pen or a stylus?
[17:33:02] <tsukkin> and nobody wants to replace that
[17:33:19] <JesseDesu> its a pencil with a bluetooth sensor

[17:33:29] <potatoxel[m]> coot
[17:33:32] <potatoxel[m]> c:
[17:33:33] <tsukkin> a stylus is used on a touchscreen , digital pens work differently
[17:33:38] <HubertFarnsworth> I see amigojapan 
[17:33:40] <JesseDesu> stylus/pen is the same thing i think?
[17:33:44] <tsukkin> no
[17:34:01] <JesseDesu> its a pen then
[17:34:10] <potatoxel[m]> nice drawin
[17:34:13] <JesseDesu> its more precise than touch screen
[17:34:15] <amigojapan> Jesse if it is used for a computer I think it is technically a stylus. "Pencil"is a marketing name

[18:04:28] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: but it is very difficult to contact most famous people, but not everyone, I have contacted the 8 but guy and he replied. And Tom Scott and Wozniak have a public email

[18:07:29] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: Wozniak has a secretary that looks at his email before it goes to him
[18:07:35] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: they are also on twitter and reddit, you can message them that way too
[18:07:47] <amigojapan> True
[18:08:11] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: sure but they get like tons of emails, what makes someone like you or me special
[18:08:59] <amigojapan> Even if I could be special, it is hard to get their attention
[18:09:05] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: back in the day fans used to write real letters
[18:09:15] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah
[18:09:59] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: they don't publish the address of their office, let me check
[18:10:37] <HubertFarnsworth> It's not they're just popular but they are damn good at what they do. That's impressive.
[18:11:09] <HubertFarnsworth> I like Gigguk the most, his views, tastes are similar to mine
[18:12:34] <HubertFarnsworth> and also he is very eloquent when he talks about anime

[18:14:55] <darkwitch> gaaaaa!
[18:15:15] <amigojapan> Are you ok darkwitch ?
[18:15:52] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I think only people who really like tragedy like it
[18:16:24] <darkwitch> I'm just frustrated after researching the gamma isomer content in various products
[18:16:57] <amigojapan> Is there radio activity? darkwitch 
[18:17:17] <darkwitch> in the "iso e super" family so to speak
[18:17:18] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't think so. There are tragedy anime like grave of butterflies with well developed characters and plot. School days just doesn't make any sense. It's improbable anime.
[18:17:33] <HubertFarnsworth> the characters, plot are absurd
[18:18:23] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: it's the shock at the end of the show which makes it good
[18:18:25] <darkwitch> no, there are many companies making something that is kind of similar but with different isomer blends
[18:18:48] <amigojapan> !c isomer
[18:18:50] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: In chemistry, isomers are molecules or polyatomic ions with identical molecular formulas ‚Äî that is, same number of atoms of each element ‚Äî but distinct arrangements of atoms in space. Isomerism is existence or possibility of isomers.
[18:19:27] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[18:19:37] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: they do a lot of research on isomers as the most tend to be patented by companies
[18:19:54] <darkwitch> Isocyclemone E (<8%), Iso E Super (8%), Timbersilk (15%), Iso Gamma Super (18%),  Sylvamber (22%)
[18:19:56] <HubertFarnsworth> they try to find new isomers and what not
[18:22:39] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: I think that is also what "kikken doragu" is, they take known drugs and change a small amount and it becomes a different chemical with similar effects. And the Japanese government has not found a way to make them all illegal
[18:22:59] <darkwitch> not just find new but finding ways of producing the ones they or the market wants

[20:31:15] <Nanobot> What I need right now isn't FAP, it's FK. The family key.
[20:31:33] <Bco1981> going the incest route ?
[20:31:48] <sentionics> A great and glorious Nanobot took to the planes of ##anime land. A drunken senti walked up and said hi. Nanobot obliged this peasant with a response. Work had to be done. So Nanobot slapped Sadale for licking people in an unwarranted manner. And thus the great and glorious Nanobot abides.
[20:32:11] <Nanobot> I need some way to determine whether two parents in Aeries are the same person. It looks like I'll have to use heuristics, which is... ugh.
[20:32:50] <MootPoot> I  feel like  heuristics is  like AI
[20:32:57] <MootPoot> its a word that people use but nobody really knows what it means

[20:36:31] <MootPoot> if circle one has A,A,A and circle two has A,B,C and I join on A
[20:36:45] <Nanobot> Lots of people use circles, which isn't really helpful IMO.
[20:36:48] <MootPoot> will that return 3 rows with A,A,C,C in them

[20:41:11] <Nanobot> Take a left join, for example. You have two tables (A and B) and a join condition (something like "B.id = A.b_id"). For each row in A, look for any rows in B that match that join condition with the current A. For each match, your output is going to contain the cells from the A row and the cells from the B row. So, if three rows from B match one row from A, then you're going to see three rows all with identical values for the A columns, and each of those 
[20:41:11] <Nanobot> rows will also have the values from the corresponding B row.
[20:41:44] <Nanobot> With a left join, if a row from A didn't match any row from B, then your output will still contain the row from A, and will simply have nulls for all the B columns.
[20:42:21] <Nanobot> With an inner join, if there's no match, then the row from A will *not* be in the output.
[20:42:51] <Nanobot> And those are the only two types of joins you'll need 99% of the time.

[20:47:33] <Nanobot> Jigsy: It depends on what you're doing. There are cases where you really don't want to deal with rows from A that don't match the condition.
[20:47:52] <Jigsy> In my case, I was trying to return all information.
[20:48:04] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: try out notion

[20:59:09] <MootPoot> JesseDesu: what's the difference between a 300 dollar piano and a 1000 dollar piano
[20:59:19] <JesseDesu> 700$
[20:59:25] <JesseDesu> i dunno
[20:59:38] <JesseDesu> probably where its made and whats it made of
[20:59:48] <Bco1981> i would expect some quailty, and some extra features
[21:00:00] <MootPoot> yeah but like what extra features
[21:00:12] <JesseDesu> and where its made probably has higher tolerances
[21:00:19] <MootPoot> extra features like how there is a worlds difference between a 300 and 1000 dollar cpu
[21:00:49] <MootPoot> or extra features like cheap 3d printer vs nice one - its a bit more polished but nothing really jusifying the cost
[21:00:54] <JesseDesu> i can tell you the difference between a squier and an american made telecaster
[21:01:14] <JesseDesu> which is similarly priced, one is 250-300 and the other is 1100-1500
[21:02:02] <JesseDesu> one is made in mexico by mexicans, the other is made in america, probably by mexicans
[21:02:19] <MootPoot> !g telecaster

[21:02:24] <MootPoot> its  just a guitar
[21:02:26] <JesseDesu> the wood has more resonance
[21:02:32] <MootPoot> why does it have a name like that
[21:02:33] <JesseDesu> the pickups are wound better
[21:02:40] <MootPoot> just  call it a fancy guitar
[21:02:44] <JesseDesu> because broadcaster was already taken
[21:02:51] <JesseDesu> it was a drum kit model
[21:03:00] <JesseDesu> so they used telecaster like tv
[21:03:16] <JesseDesu> this was around 1952 when televisions started
[21:03:27] <JesseDesu> becoming household products i mean
[21:03:34] <JesseDesu> they had television in ww2
[21:04:16] <JesseDesu> in fact, there was a television guided bomb where a pigeon would ride the bomb and peck on the target like a touch screen, updating the guidance
[21:04:37] <JesseDesu> it was later made into a laser guided version
[21:05:24] <JesseDesu> in america we dont kamikaze with humans, we use pigeons
[21:06:00] <JesseDesu> anyways

[23:20:02] <MootPoot> so it does change every week
[23:20:12] <emmeka> if proton actually works 100%, even if some games require minor tweaks to launch options, then what's left for Microsoft. Photoshop?
[23:20:12] <MootPoot> if it actually gets pushed in a patch though - I'll be mad then
[23:20:27] <Nanobot> The brace does make the nonstop nutting a bit more awkward, though.
[23:20:36] <MootPoot> emmeka: plenty of dev tools
[23:20:42] <MootPoot> I guess for the normie I see your point
[23:21:06] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: do your duty, close your eyes and think of Indonesia
[23:21:06] <MootPoot> Visual Studio / SQL server , all the M$ development tools and tie ins
[23:21:21] <Nanobot> Porn is banned in Indonesia.
[23:21:28] <emmeka> I wonder why adobe holds the line against linux so much. I mean, you can get it on Mac, right
[23:21:37] <emmeka> it's not like Microsoft is holding them hostage
[23:21:40] <MootPoot> does it?
[23:21:46] <MootPoot> I thought they just didnt care
[23:21:50] <MootPoot> small market
[23:22:37] <beaky> cali is kawaii
[23:23:02] <tcsilver> can't make you happier now! :D
[23:23:22] <emmeka> MootPoot sure, small market, but it's one of the last major non-Microsoft products without a particularly good alternative to have like 0 linux support.
[23:23:33] <TsundereNoises> I love gimp
[23:23:40] <TsundereNoises> better than photoshop for what little I do
[23:23:41] * MootPoot gimps TsundereNoises 
[23:24:03] <Nanobot> I hate Gimp with a passion.
[23:24:05] <emmeka> gimp is good enough. but it isn't quite up to par with photoshop.
[23:24:16] <tcsilver> ah
[23:24:20] <emmeka> it works, if you need it only occasionally and not professionally
[23:24:23] *** Quits: jess (~jess@libera/staff/jess) (Quit: I try to be an optimist / but my glass is always bone dry)
[23:24:27] <tcsilver> not quite as good huh ?
[23:24:39] <tcsilver> what's a good app for sprites ? I used to use paint shop pro
[23:24:40] <TsundereNoises> I'm not an artist, but neither are most people
[23:24:41] <emmeka> also there's Inkscape vs Adobe Illustrator
[23:24:47] <emmeka> again, works, but not as good
[23:25:15] <MootPoot> When I need to edit a photo, I print it out, scribble on it with a marker and then fax it to myself, take a picture, then email it to myself
[23:25:18] <TsundereNoises> why isn't it as good though?
[23:25:18] <MootPoot> works every time
[23:25:28] <TsundereNoises> that sounds like a good plan
[23:25:41] <TsundereNoises> the fax machine adds a very artistic grain filter
[23:26:38] <emmeka> something I'm glad I did once upon a time is that my high school had a random bonus computer design course. It taught photoshop, autocad, that kind of thing. I'm by no means pro with them but the vague memory of that class lets me do some nice things.
[23:26:53] <emmeka> but because of that, when I use gimp I see its shortcomings
[23:27:07] <Nanobot> How these conversations always seem to go for me: <WrongPerson> Gimp is a good alternative to Photoshop. <Me> No it isn't. It's terrible. <WrongPerson> It can do everything Photoshop can do. <Me> No it can't. Here, let me list a bunch of things you can do in Photoshop 7 (as in, even before the CS series) that Gimp still can't do. <WrongPerson> Well, Gimp is different from Photoshop. It isn't really meant to compete in the same space. <Me> Then it isn't a 
[23:27:08] <Nanobot> good alternative. <WrongPerson> I never said it was.
[23:27:33] <MootPoot> shophoto
[23:27:43] <MootPoot> is there a online browser photoshop yet?
[23:27:46] <emmeka> on an incredibly basic level they are interchangeable, yes they both draw and paint and all sorts of incredibly basic tools but you can do a *lot* more with photoshop.
[23:28:20] <TsundereNoises> you make it sound like gimp is just paint though
[23:28:28] <TsundereNoises> anyway, I'm not all that invested in fighting this
[23:28:37] <emmeka> compared to photoshop, it's paint with layers
[23:28:55] <TsundereNoises> I use it when, about once a year, I decide I'm going to try single-handedly translating a manga oneshot, clean and edit some panels, translate a few, and then give up
[23:29:09] <emmeka> which is fine, most people probably only need paint with layers
[23:29:10] <TsundereNoises> and it does absolutely everything needed for that
[23:29:34] <tcsilver> is it good for sprites ?
[23:29:34] *** Joins: aHick (~memes@143.60.228.11)
[23:29:45] <tcsilver> for editing sprites or making them from scratch
[23:29:46] <TsundereNoises> hey, I also need the curve drawing tool
[23:30:17] <emmeka> but to say it's better than photoshop is disingenuous
[23:30:38] <TsundereNoises> I legitimately didn't say that, I said I like it better
[23:30:53] <emmeka> Nanobot your prediction came true!
[23:31:01] <TsundereNoises> but I'm not interested in living out nanobot's prophecy
[23:31:05] <TsundereNoises> lol
[23:31:16] <TsundereNoises> but I seriously didn't say that earlier
[23:31:39] <tcsilver> I'm a girl!
[23:31:45] <TsundereNoises> congrats?
[23:31:54] <tcsilver> jk :---------)
[23:32:00] <tcsilver> I just wanted attention! :---D

[23:39:26] <emmeka> MootPoot anyway, it's a less and less small market every year. 15 years ago linux desktop market share was <0.5%. Last year it approached 4%. To put that in perspective, MacOS market share is around a steady 7% right now.
[23:40:25] <TsundereNoises> Mac is that low? I guess it must be a much higher % among people who use laptops in coffeeshops
[23:40:44] <MootPoot> ^
[23:40:50] <MootPoot> I thought mac was like
[23:40:51] <MootPoot> idk
[23:40:53] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: my first thought was bad, but nice image, peko
[23:40:54] <MootPoot> 20-30%
[23:40:57] <MootPoot> or was that phones
[23:41:28] <Bco1981> TsundereNoises: you saw the sports festival, her impressive flying skills.
[23:41:35] <Bco1981> that's the "heroic" landing
[23:41:42] <TsundereNoises> to be fair, Linux is much higher than 4% among people I run into, I know it's not an even sample
[23:41:52] <TsundereNoises> Bco1981: yeah I know, I saw her pinpoint accuracy
[23:42:02] <TsundereNoises> I just had a very beaky thought first
[23:42:27] <TsundereNoises> I actually need tofinish watching the sports festival, but I saw up through the red light green light
[23:42:51] <emmeka> also that linux market share doesn't include ChromeOS, which is currently outselling Macs
[23:42:51] <Bco1981> lucky dog korone
[23:42:57] <MootPoot> what
[23:42:59] <MootPoot> why
[23:43:05] <MootPoot> linux should include chromebooks
[23:43:09] <TsundereNoises> the bird man game was really neat, I wish they'd have that in an anime one day
[23:43:21] <emmeka> it should, but for some reason everything I've looked at counts it differently
[23:45:05] <MootPoot> I'm considering buying cloud storage
[23:45:20] <MootPoot> 100 USD gets me a lifetime plan of 150gb
[23:45:24] <MootPoot> not bad in the long run
[23:50:07] <Bco1981> 120 ish USD a year gets 2TB
[23:50:09] <Bco1981> google
[23:51:21] <MootPoot> problem is 1.) I either need very little or a LOT of cloud storage
[23:51:38] <MootPoot> nobody is offering a 50TB + lifetime plan lol for my anime collection
[23:51:51] <MootPoot> not to mention the upload time for that...
[23:52:20] <MootPoot> so this 150gb pay once use forever plan is actually exactly what I need really
[23:52:31] <MootPoot> just for moving files when I'm away from home
[23:52:34] <Bco1981> yeah, i go with local storage for that... just use raid, then there is less chance of losing everything at once if one disk dies.

[23:56:22] <Bco1981> i received my ssd for my rpi4, and looks like there are firmware updates so it should be able to boot directly from the ssd. but you have to do the initial install on a sdcard, then copy that to the ssd.
[23:56:47] <MootPoot> how do you hook up a SATA drive to the pi
[23:56:54] <MootPoot> through the GPIO or a usb adapter
[23:57:28] <tcsilver> hmmm.... I wonder if i should code a 3d double dragon clone with newly made graphics
[23:57:31] <Bco1981> a expansion thing for my argon one case that connects a new sata ssd board to a usb3.0 port
[23:57:55] <Bco1981> it becomes the new bottom for the case.
[23:58:04] <MootPoot> I feel like if I REALLY needed to I could main the pi as a main pc
[23:58:07] <MootPoot> it would be shit though
[23:58:07] <tcsilver> or what should be my first 3d game... since I coded so many RPGs... should it be an RPG or a different type of game
