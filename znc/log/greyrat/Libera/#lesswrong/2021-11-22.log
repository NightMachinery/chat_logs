[00:11:57] <two2thehead> "The supply-chain crunch appears to have already peaked in the U.S. When I first wrote this in mid-October, it felt like a bold assessment. Over the past two years, just about anything that could go wrong with global supply chains has gone wrong, from volatile swings in demand, a wave of extreme weather events and even a container ship getting stuck in the Suez Canal. But evidence keeps piling up to suggest that the U.S. is slowly but surely making 
[00:11:57] <two2thehead> progress in easing freight congestion and supply shortages."

[00:16:35] <gwern> shawwwn: I don't buy that jukebox composed this whole thing. the main dubstep music is far too coherent and crisply sampled. I think he composed most of the track himself, around perhaps 10s samples of the vocal lyrics
[00:17:14] <gwern> shawwwn: he's not being entirely forthright, obviously, given his comment 'I tortured an AI by making it listen to my entire back catalog then asked it to generate a brand-new track for me.' - afaik there is no tool to finetune or 'train' jukebox on a collection of sound files
[00:17:34] <gwern> even something like computing an average artist embedding over his backcatalogue is more tooling than I am aware exists for jukebox

In these circumstances there can be no talk of violence on our

[08:39:42] <arbor> Well, a bit about me: I'm a backend dev for a company in the crypto space, just moved to a new town where I know nobody and would be eager to meet some fellow rationalists. In any case, don't worry, I won't chat too much until I learn the vibe here better.
[08:39:49] <shawwwn> PapuaHardyNet: string length generally doesn't have any meaning unless it's a byte string. There are very few situations where you actually need the length of a string
[08:40:24] <PapuaHardyNet> i see
[08:40:29] <shawwwn> even text rasterizers generally only need semantic length
[08:41:34] <shawwwn> usually you're iterating over a string for the purpose of e.g. comparing two strings. But in that case, they'll have the same semantic length if they're equal, and if they're not, then the length doesn't matter. It's surprising but it's really hard to think of any case where it's required.
[08:41:55] <PapuaHardyNet> yep, I agree
[08:42:00] <nshepperd2> also sometimes we admire the trainwreck that is the bay area ratculture from a safe distance

[09:58:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> "I’m suddenly surrounded by QR codes. There are now Airbnb doors I can’t open, cars I can’t start, menus I can’t read. Paper menus have vanished; ordering food has become an ordeal." ... cars? What? Paper menus have vanished? Where? I haven't ever been to a place without paper menus
[09:58:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> "At a recent dinner with friends, after some initial chatting, everyone stared at menus on their phones. I sat there for a minute looking around the table and then whispered to my neighbor, discreetly asking to look on. When I eat out alone, I show my flip-phone to the waiter and ask for a proper menu. After an eye-roll, they’ll either bring out a paper menu from some vault in the back or hand me their own phone to use." ...
[09:58:54] <Obormot\Arcturus>  what the fuck?
[10:00:36] <PlanckWalk> Yes, it's getting harder to be phoneless.
[10:01:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, I mean "where is any of this true"?
[10:01:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Not here, that's for sure
[10:02:21] <PlanckWalk> I haven't experienced those particular things.  No idea if those are true.
[10:02:41] <PlanckWalk> There is a pizza place that stopped accepting phone orders, only phone *app* orders.

[10:03:12] <PlanckWalk> I haven't been out to eat at a restaurant in about 2 years
[10:04:13] <PlanckWalk> There are places here that will grumble about even letting you in the door if you don't have a smartphone
[10:04:21] <superz> ^
[10:04:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... what?
[10:04:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> You're gonna have to explain that one
[10:05:18] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: spain, apparently
[10:05:41] <PlanckWalk> There's mandatory COVID tracing at a lot of places, and while the law says they do have to have a manual check-in process instead of a QR code, they don't have to be happy about digging out their manual form.
[10:06:35] <nshepperd2> idk about the airbnb doors or cars but here the 'no paper menus' thing is totally true
[10:06:36] <PlanckWalk> Have to have the option of*
[10:06:38] <arbor> Where I live, virtually no restaurants have paper menus and everything is indeed a QR code. But I live in the most COVID-conservative state. Also, even here, you can ask for a paper menu as a fallback and the idea that everyone will roll their eyes at you for doing so is ridiculous
[10:06:48] <arbor> paper menus by default*
[10:07:08] <nshepperd2> an insane anti-covid measure from the era of airborne-denialism
[10:07:37] <saturn2> most people are still in airborne denial
[10:07:49] <arbor> the extent to which all reactions to COVID are unscientific makes me sad every day
[10:07:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> PlanckWalk: Oh I see, a covid thing
[10:08:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> arbor: What state?!
[10:08:16] <arbor> Obormot\Arcturus: Hawaii
[10:08:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... wow
[10:08:21] <PapuaHardyNet> huh
[10:08:42] <arbor> We have never removed mandatory masking from indoor spaces, we still have restaurant capacity restrictions, and 90% of people on Oahu mask outside 100% of the time still
[10:09:00] <PlanckWalk> Also a bunch of places here are starting to not exactly require, just expect, that you will use your phone for everything to do with their organization.  Sometimes even expect that you will have installed their app.
[10:09:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> This is some crazy shit. I'm glad I live in technologically backward NYC, where we don't have any of this smartphone nonsense
[10:09:16] <nshepperd2> (and yet the masks are still useless scraps of cloth)
[10:09:38] <superz> wait. some of you guys actually experienced eye rolls for not using QR or not having a smartphone?
[10:09:49] <PlanckWalk> (Never use your phone as a *phone*, god forbid that someone has to communicate with you through it, just as an internet-connected device)
[10:10:05] <PlanckWalk> superz: Plenty of times
[10:10:08] <saturn2> so far i haven't
[10:10:13] <arbor> The idea that any human being can reasonably believe that masking outdoors, on an island that constantly experiences moderate to heavy winds at all times, would have any effect is patently insane
[10:10:20] <arbor> But also, outdoor masking in general lol
[10:10:28] <PlanckWalk> My first choice for internet provider didn't even have a process for a person without a smartphone to set up an account.
[10:10:35] <PlanckWalk> So I went with the second.
[10:11:27] <arbor> PlanckWalk: what provider? Is this in the US?
[10:11:36] <PlanckWalk> No, it's in Australia
[10:11:45] <arbor> Ah, got it, interesting
[10:11:55] <PlanckWalk> It was Aussie Broadband, specifically.
[10:12:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Good god
[10:12:10] <superz> god bless NYC
[10:12:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> ^
[10:12:28] <nshepperd2> PlanckWalk: wat
[10:12:38] <PlanckWalk> nshepperd2: That was exactly my reaction!
[10:13:05] <saturn2> seems like the US is lagging behind on this despite (or because of) being the country where the main smartphone companies are headquartered
[10:13:50] <PlanckWalk> You definitely don't want to go down that path :-p
[10:14:13] <arbor> I experience some of this. My barber shop operates on an iPhone app only, but I have an Android phone. So I have to call them to schedule appointments manually
[10:14:59] <saturn2> as long as they still accept calls
[10:15:07] <arbor> I can imagine how frustrating it would be to encounter that friction in a way you truly can't resolve, if you truly insisted on not having a smartphone
[10:15:21] <PlanckWalk> It's bad enough that one government department here has an online terms of service that includes "You are bound by the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service and Google Privacy Policy"
[10:15:38] <PlanckWalk> ... and to deal with them, they always want you to do stuff online.
[10:15:44] <spxtr> my friend doesn't have a smartphone. it seems to work out for him
[10:15:50] <spxtr> he also pays with cash everywhere
[10:16:01] <PlanckWalk> I pay with cash everywhere feasible, too
[10:16:02] *** Quits: thlnz (~thln@user/thlnz) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[10:16:17] <spxtr> many places around here just don't accept cash. it's very bothersome
[10:16:24] <arbor> PlanckWalk: fast-forward: "starting in 2031, you must have a Google account to submit your tax forms."
[10:16:37] <spxtr> mainly because I need a steady supply of quarters for laundry, so I usually ask for them as change when I buy stuff with cash
[10:16:42] <PlanckWalk> Seriously would not surprise me.
[10:17:45] <saturn2> i wouldn't have much of a problem with being required to buy an electronic gadget, if the gadget didn't spy on me and literally try to make me feel bad all the time

[10:18:14] <nshepperd2> we have our own version of the audiologist cartel in australia. they sell hearing aids that have smartphone features like configuring equalizer presets or playing music. they only sell hearing aids that exclusively work with iphones
[10:18:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> None of this "iPhone app" nonsense
[10:18:19] <PlanckWalk> saturn2: Exactly!
[10:18:31] <nshepperd2> something which i am sure apple paid lots of "donations" for
[10:18:40] <PlanckWalk> ... and also constantly "update" to something crappier.
[10:22:15] <arbor> Obormot\Arcturus: note also that the iPhone app does nothing except allow you to choose a stylist and a time, achieving nothing over a basic Calendly page, for example
[10:24:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> :\
[10:26:54] <arbor> You live in NYC? How do you like it these days? Headlines about how NYC is doing seem very sensational
[10:27:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's fine
[10:27:48] <Obormot\Arcturus> Even setting covid aside, not as good as it was
[10:27:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> de Blasio has really done a number on the city
[10:28:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> But we all home Adams will reverse at least some of that
[10:28:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> *hope
[10:28:39] <arbor> Sorry to hear that. I hope that is the case
[10:29:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> But on the whole, still a good place to live. Still safe, still cheap in pretty much all ways except rent (and I don't live in a fancy neighborhood so my rent is entirely tolerable)

[10:31:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> None of this "gotta have a smartphone" nonsense
[10:32:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can still walk down the block and get a slice of pizza and a bagel, like proper
[10:33:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can drive down a couple neighborhoods over and have some sushi and not even get vax-carded
[10:35:55] <arbor> That sounds like a dream from my point of view
[10:36:18] <feep[work]> I have literally never been vax checked, it's fucking disgraceful
[10:36:40] <feep[work]> and demonstrates to what degree the government is running this epidemic on twine and hopes.
[10:37:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah it's ... simultaneously good and bad?
[10:37:34] <otoburb> I guess it depends on the neighborhood. Get vax-carded in most restaurants here. Bagel and pizza shops are more lax about it. 
[10:37:38] <feep[work]> a convenient demonstration of incompetence or powerlessness
[10:37:51] <arbor> I doubt vax checks going on longer than a month or two will convince anybody new. It's been impossible to do much of anything in public without a check for like three months here, but our vax rates have barely budged in that time
[10:37:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, the pizza place I went to in Manhattan last week or w/e, there was this big sign affixed to the counter that said "Customers dining in MUST show BOTH ID card and vax card!!"
[10:38:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... needless to say, nobody asked anyone for either of those things
[10:38:24] <feep[work]> the sign was the only thing that was actually checked? :p
[10:38:29] <PlanckWalk> Here the primary recommended vax-check proof is ... a smartphone app.
[10:38:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Everyone, customers and staff, just collectively pretended that the sign didn't exist and that nothing unusual was going on at all
[10:38:47] <PlanckWalk> Bleh.
[10:38:53] <Obormot\Arcturus> Just a perfectly normal day, no pandemic happening
[10:39:00] <feep[work]> I'm just happy that I've seen store personnel ask for facemasks
[10:39:09] <arbor> What about contact tracing? Any address and phone number forms around?
[10:39:22] <otoburb> A customer in an UWS pizza shop freaked out when an old guy took the seat across from her. 
[10:39:24] <feep[work]> arbor: we *had* those, then the police used them to contact witnesses
[10:39:40] <otoburb> Neighborhood-specific.
[10:39:42] <feep[work]> I wish I could say "and nobody trusted them again", but they're still used, just now some people write fake addresses, lol.
[10:40:01] <otoburb> arbor: Not any more. 
[10:40:09] <feep[work]> honestly I'm still mad it took a year for our phone tracing app to get location support
[10:40:21] <feep[work]> we suggested that feature on the issue tracker in fucking may.
[10:40:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> arbor: Ironically, the *only* place I have ever been vax-carded and contact-traced (i.e., asked to sign in with a name and phone #) was my favorite Russian eatery (the one that has old Soviet slogans and paraphernalia plastered all over the walls)
[10:40:25] <feep[work]> 2020.
[10:40:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> So, I guess that was ... on theme??
[10:40:44] <arbor> Obormot\Arcturus: LOL
[10:40:50] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: in soviet russia, contact traces you?
[10:40:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> I dunno lol
[10:41:00] <feep[work]> hm, needs work
[10:41:10] <arbor> I applaud their dedication to the theme of Russianness
[10:41:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> Actually they did the contact trace thing at first, then they stopped
[10:41:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> I suspect they've probably stopped doing the vax card thing by now too
[10:41:48] <feep[work]> sidenote: there's a german saying that literally goes "russia is big and the czar is far away"
[10:42:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Honestly, it's just ... it's so obvious that nobody gives a shit
[10:42:01] <kuudes> good morning
[10:42:04] <feep[work]> hi
[10:42:31] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: well, the problem is that ... the government clearly doesn't give a shit either
[10:42:39] <kuudes> nice thing about gdpr is that it means in europe no one can require you to assent to terms and conditions like smartphone stuff
[10:42:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Not just with covid stuff. The plastic bag ban... there were always some stores that just ignored it. But many didn't. Well... more and more of those are starting to ignore it too)
[10:42:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Yes, that's my point. Nobody, including the government, gives a shit
[10:42:54] <feep[work]> legitimacy is a scarce resource.
[10:43:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> We had that whole "Excelsior Pass" thing here in New York State... what happened to that? Nobody knows
[10:44:02] <kuudes> at work they use facebook workplace, but as it is optional, I have not registered...
[10:44:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> In order to actually make that work and be useful and used, a whole bunch of people would've had to do a whole bunch of work!
[10:44:19] <otoburb> Excelsior Pass is still available.
[10:44:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> And instead, they just ... didn't.
[10:44:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> otoburb: "available", yes
[10:44:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> But literally nobody I know uses it or ... interacts with it in any way whatsoever
[10:44:49] <kuudes> over here we have that smartphone covid bluetooth thingy, no site qr codes
[10:45:00] <otoburb> We get vax-carded here a lot, so my wife and I use it.

[10:45:16] <feep[work]> actually it's hilarious
[10:45:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> otoburb: Weird!
[10:45:27] <feep[work]> I was sitting in a restaurant eating lunch the other day, our company goes there a lot
[10:45:40] <kuudes> I have the pdf for the vaccination qr code but as I don't go anywhere I haven't needed it so far 
[10:45:45] <feep[work]> and what do I see from the corner of my eye? the cashier certificate validating some other customer with her smartphone!
[10:45:55] <feep[work]> I never felt so simultaneously relieved and snubbed.
[10:45:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hah
[10:46:16] <feep[work]> (turns out they just ... knew who and where we were, lol.)
[10:46:38] <feep[work]> (no need to vax check if they can just give us a call in the event of an outbreak.)
[10:47:23] <feep[work]> well, not quite I guess, they really should have checked us anyways.. idk. meh.
[10:47:39] <kuudes> huh? but isn't the vax check a mandatory thing to turn away unvaxed?
[10:48:22] <kuudes> how do they know you are vaxxed if they don't check?
[10:48:28] <feep[work]> see um
[10:48:29] <feep[work]> above
[10:48:33] <feep[work]> re "they really don't give a fuck"
[10:48:40] <feep[work]> social reality bleeds into everything
[10:48:48] <kuudes> oh, so they don't get repercussions for failing?
[10:48:49] <feep[work]> they know us, we're repeat customers
[10:48:57] <feep[work]> they don't even get *checked* for failing.
[10:49:04] <kuudes> oh
[10:49:11] <feep[work]> there's approximately no validation that 3G rules are kept to.
[10:49:19] <kuudes> oh :-(
[10:49:21] <feep[work]> as I said: even the government doesn't give a fuck.
[10:49:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Nobody gives a shit about any of this, as stated earlier
[10:49:29] <feep[work]> they're in full "let em die, cover your own ass" mode
[10:49:57] <feep[work]> merkel could probably have done something about it! but she's gone, and she's left an amazing ambition vacuum behind
[10:49:59] <kuudes> yeah, that is correlated with high covid, I guess
[10:50:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Almost no one actually thinks that their actions in this domain have anything to do with any actual, practical reality and any actual tangible consequences to them
[10:50:28] <feep[work]> this is why we should teach timeless decision theory in high school
[10:50:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: TDT is old and busted, the new hotness is FDT
[10:50:51] <feep[work]> classism? get ready for reference classism
[10:51:02] <kuudes> hmm, I haven't been to any restaurants; but at least the news has it that at least the officials have closed down the pub that specifically voiced they will not obey covid rules
[10:51:27] <PapuaHardyNet> functional decision theory?
[10:51:40] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: counter-argument: nobody understands monads, so calling a theory "functional" has an obvious image problem
[10:51:42] <kuudes> and that they do spot checks to random places, same as with alcohol permits
[10:51:47] <feep[work]> conversely, everyone can relate to not having time
[10:51:56] <kuudes> feep[work], hah
[10:52:13] <feep[work]> kuudes: yeah, over here the police also do not give any fuck
[10:52:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> feep[work]: Did you see that Haskell joke I posted the other day
[10:52:31] <feep[work]> no, post it again?
[10:52:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Why is my program still considered imperative, even though I wrote it in Haskell??"
[10:52:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Because it's not functional."
[10:52:56] <feep[work]> chhehe
[10:56:04] <saturn2> the spooky thing is that covid didn't suddenly make people think their actions need not have any connection with tangible reality... they were like that all along
[10:56:49] <feep[work]> pet peeve: this is directly the fault of the media
[10:56:58] <feep[work]> people have lost national cohesion, which is the natural tdt implementation
[10:57:50] <feep[work]> divisive news reporting is directly responsible for people thinking their actions don't matter.
[10:59:42] <kuudes> but did they have such in the past?
[10:59:47] <feep[work]> yes, through ignorance
[11:00:06] <feep[work]> cohesion is going up, but common opinion of cohesion is going down
[11:00:26] <feep[work]> (note: I have ZERO sources for this!)
[11:00:44] <feep[work]> (this is more a mood than even an opinion)
[11:01:13] <feep[work]> though wouldn't it be like
[11:01:14] <feep[work]> darkly funny
[11:01:25] <feep[work]> if the set of "things that can be destroyed by the truth" included humanism and/or humanity
[11:01:27] <adiabatic> I feel weird for paying attention to things some times
[11:01:41] <kuudes> ... when I was born, DDR was still a thing
[11:02:01] <adiabatic> kuudes: East Germany?
[11:02:06] <feep[work]> same
[11:02:35] <kuudes> adiabatic, yes
[11:02:37] <feep[work]> but like, maybe having two camps was kind of the optimal state?
[11:02:41] <feep[work]> and it's been downhill since then
[11:03:30] <feep[work]> ANYWAY: actual work! afk
[11:03:30] <kuudes> it feels a bit odd to me if in ddr people thought their actions mattered. I guess the idealistic supporters maybe?
[11:03:34] <nshepperd2> dance dancer revolution is still a thing
[11:03:56] <feep[work]> kuudes: I mean, if you look at the way the ddr ended, it was kind of this spectacular moment of unity
[11:04:14] <feep[work]> because everyone knew what side they were on ("not the government")
[11:04:46] <kuudes> yeah

[11:40:52] <saturn2> risky to use random youtube uploads for this

[11:41:14] <adiabatic> spxtr: conversations here: gemini://station.martinrue.com/
[11:41:23] <feep[work]> Obormot\Arcturus: no idea what conversion's been done on them, presumably
[11:41:31] <saturn2> it's likely from some 128k mp3 from limewire or something
[11:41:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok? And thus?
[11:41:39] <feep[work]> especially for nightwish, yeah
[11:42:05] <feep[work]> so the compression loss could swamp out any headphone quality difference?
[11:42:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, so the worry is, it'll sound the same (equally bad) on both, and thus the comparison will be useless?
[11:42:29] <feep[work]> yes
[11:42:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's a prediction! Let's see if it's borne out.
[11:42:56] <feep[work]> yeah you can discover that headphones sound different this way, but not that they don't
[11:43:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> Totally, yeah
[11:43:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> But note

[11:43:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> If the result I come up with is "both headphones sound the same [when listening to the stuff I listen to]", then... that's a result, right?
[11:43:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Yes it is)
[11:44:00] <feep[work]> saturn2: I can hear no difference, but I am literally on shitty headphones right now
[11:44:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I perceive no difference when listening on my HyperX headset
[11:44:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> But sure, I'll use that one
[11:44:25] <saturn2> if you can tell the difference on one pair but not the other, that would be something
[11:44:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> True!
[11:44:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, listened for a bit on the HyperX. Let's switch and compare...
[11:46:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> This sounds worse, I think...
[11:46:19] <PapuaHardyNet> this won't work obormot
[11:46:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Aside from having to turn it up louder to hear it at the same volume)
[11:46:24] <Obormot\Arcturus> PapuaHardyNet: Why not
[11:46:25] <PapuaHardyNet> it isn't a blind test
[11:46:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> How am I gonna do a blind test??
[11:46:35] <PapuaHardyNet> placebo effect is super powerful
[11:46:41] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't know, unfortunately
[11:46:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> They don't look the same, they don't feel the same
[11:47:03] <saturn2> that's fine since obormot has no desire for it to work
[11:47:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> There's no way I can set things up so I can't tell which I am wearing
[11:47:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: I mean, if these are better, I want to know
[11:47:21] <saturn2> in fact he gets $20 if it doesn't
[11:47:31] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps you could do one thing, ask multiple people this question
[11:47:38] <PapuaHardyNet> preferably people who cannot differentiate between the headphones
[11:47:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... how?
[11:47:50] <PapuaHardyNet> to half, hint one of them is better than another, and to the other vice versa
[11:48:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also, I don't care what other people think about this or perceive in this
[11:48:07] <saturn2> Obormot\Arcturus: right but you don't have any preexisting prejudice towards them
[11:48:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: That's true
[11:48:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> I can't tell the difference between the two youtube uploads on these either

[11:55:50] <feep[work]> I've been buying the same shitty in-ear headphones for years

[11:56:35] <shawwwn> the cheap ones are always the best
[11:56:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also the bass on the Koss ones is not nearly as good
[11:57:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like... not even close, really
[11:57:25] <saturn2> maybe gaming headsets are actually really good and no one has bothered to test them due to anti-gamer bigotry
[11:57:48] <feep[work]> nah they're shit

[11:57:56] <saturn2> oh
[11:57:56] <feep[work]> bass out the ass
[11:58:28] <feep[work]> I had to install an equalizer to get a halfway sane balance

[12:01:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> According to VLC, this is 6-channel audio, A52, 48kHz
[12:03:31] <PapuaHardyNet> maybe you should use 16 bit flacs
[12:03:46] <PapuaHardyNet> uhh, I'm turning into an audiophile help
[12:04:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I have no idea what that means
[12:05:01] *** Joins: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic)
[12:05:19] <saturn2> you probably mean 24 bit flacs
[12:05:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Man, this music is good)
[12:05:34] <saturn2> 16 bit is just standard
[12:05:38] <feep[work]> audiophiles are people with a reputation for obsessing over insignificant, inaudible differences in formats
[12:05:50] <feep[work]> these are the same memetic people who buy gold cables
[12:05:58] <PapuaHardyNet> well, I have mostly 16 bit flacs. 24 bit flacs are rare to find on the internet
[12:06:08] <saturn2> anything over 16 bit 40khz is just placebo
[12:07:05] <PlanckWalk> The bottom 8 bits are almost always going to be noise.
[12:07:24] <saturn2> maybe 24 bit sources are mastered better, but you could downsample them as soon as you get them and save space
[12:07:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok, so
[12:07:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> I am now very sure that the HyperX headset is better
[12:08:31] <saturn2> are the koss ones the kind that hang on hooks from your ears?
[12:08:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> I listened to it with the Koss ones first... now, I've seen this movie *at least* 10 times. Maybe more like 15. When the Hymn started, I felt *visceral disappointment* at what I heard
[12:08:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yes
[12:09:02] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[12:09:38] <saturn2> pressing them closer to your ears might make them sound better
[12:09:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Yeah, tried that
[12:09:49] <saturn2> ok
[12:09:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> That helps a little but not much
[12:10:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm, there was a much more audible difference with the movie file than with the youtube videos. Is that the "quality of encoding" thing you guys were talking about?

[12:14:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe these articles will enlighten me
[12:15:44] <saturn2> your movie has 6 audio channels instead of 2 as required for headphones, and there are various methods of converting this which will sound different

[12:16:15] <feep[work]> ie. your headphones will try to emulate spatial sound
[12:16:39] <feep[work]> s/will/may/
[12:16:44] <saturn2> if your gamer headset has a usb connection and its own electronics, it's likely doing a better job than vlc
[12:17:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> No it's a normal 3.5mm audio connector
[12:17:15] <feep[work]> wait
[12:17:19] <saturn2> oh ok, nevermind then
[12:17:21] <feep[work]> how is it 6 chann-- oh, right, the movie is
[12:17:31] <feep[work]> no idea what happens in that case
[12:17:42] <saturn2> vlc downmixes automatically
[12:18:13] <feep[work]> huh okay. wonder how.
[12:18:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well the Conan file is just stereo
[12:18:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> 128 kbps, 44kHz
[12:18:55] <PapuaHardyNet> that's yucky, 128kbps?
[12:19:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> There is less of a difference with this one
[12:19:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Almost no difference
[12:19:30] <PapuaHardyNet> that's because 128kbps is super low quality audio, although acceptable
[12:19:43] <feep[work]> 128kbps is about the boundary where it's still plausible that you can hear a difference.
[12:20:16] <feep[work]> well, mp3. modern codecs are better.
[12:20:22] <feep[work]> if this is 128kbps aac it's probably fine.
[12:20:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, I'm not certain I could tell the difference between the two sets of headphones, with this file

[12:21:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok let's see

[12:22:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> Let's do Dragonforce next I guess
[12:22:15] <shawwwn> in particular, it's nearly impossible that someone could tell the difference between an mp3 and an aac, unless you go out of your way to maul the mp3 settings

[12:22:31] <feep[work]> (amusingly, mpeg-3 is not mp3, mp3 is mpeg-2)
[12:23:08] <shawwwn> Obormot is likely confusing himself due to volume differences and headphone texture differences

[12:43:20] <feep[work]> I kinda wanna do a study on this
[12:43:40] <feep[work]> sit people in front of a monitor, flash up a white pane, flash up a white pane that has quickly fading in yellow spots, measure how fast people look away
[12:43:53] <feep[work]> I bet they'd look away way sooner and more reliably with the yellow spots
[12:43:56] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't think people will have such an aversive reaction
[12:44:12] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: well, it's visual code for "your eyes will take damage if you keep looking"
[12:44:23] <feep[work]> if anything should trigger aversion, "spots appear in your vision" is it
[12:44:48] <PapuaHardyNet> okay, you seem correct.
[12:45:07] <PapuaHardyNet> too bad we don't have a #lesswrong experiment foundation that we can ask to do such studies for us

[13:13:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> (How is this movie SO COOL. It's totally unreasonable)
[13:13:47] <PapuaHardyNet> I've never seen it
[13:14:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Have you seen the original?
[13:20:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok. My final verdict:
[13:21:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> The Koss headphones are very impressive for the price. Better sound than I would've expected, for sure.
[13:21:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the best case (with low-quality sound files, e.g. many youtube uploads, and so on), they are comparable to the HyperX headset.
[13:22:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> In other cases (especially where there's a strong bass component), they're inferior. And the sound is less space-filling (or w/e the right term is).

[13:23:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> I don't know why anyone would say that the Koss headphones are better than the gaming headset. I just don't see any indication of that at all. I can't imagine what it would take for that to be the case.
[13:24:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also the Koss headphones are uncomfortable to wear.
[13:24:20] <feep[work]> PapuaHardyNet: okay, there's something you need to understand about tron legacy. its critics say that it's just a daft punk music video. and they are ENTIRELY CORRECT. (except for the "just" part)
[13:25:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Yes, just like "Brother" is a Nautilus Pompilius music video)
[13:25:58] <feep[work]> on top of that ... like, um. I've repeatedly criticized the marvel superhero style of moviemaking where you just stitch scenes together back to back and slap a release on it, the building and release of tension is an art that's increasingly impoverished. and like, nobody will say that tron legacy's story is deep, it's incredibly basic, but it's also incredibly well executed.
[13:26:20] <feep[work]> but more than that, I credit them that they allow their setting to breathe.
[13:26:41] <feep[work]> there's long tracking shots of just scenery porn that go on *minutes* longer than they would in any modern movie
[13:26:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's "basic" because it's *literally* the Hero's Journey, in absolutely classic and perfect form
[13:27:16] <feep[work]> yeah and because it's so basic, it can affort to play with its shape a bit
[13:27:24] <feep[work]> without overbearing itself
[13:27:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[13:27:58] <feep[work]> like how it's a descent into tartarus, but clu is trying to do his own hero's journey in reverse
[13:28:19] <feep[work]> that was pretty~ like, it wasn't deep, but the fact that it's such a basic setup to begin with lets it do those reversals in a really legible way.

[13:46:06] <feep[work]> um
[13:46:13] <feep[work]> so, the moral of the entire musical is basically "they fuck you up, your mom and dad"
[13:46:36] <feep[work]> everyone has parental trauma that they're acting out in their dysfunctionalities
[13:46:58] <feep[work]> anyway, the witch is ... um... she's evil, but she's evil in a particularly legible way that indicates she's internalized some really bad parenting
[13:48:47] <feep[work]> and she sings this great three-part recurring number over the musical, where the refrain goes first, "why could you not obey? children should listen!" and then, after some drama, "no matter what you say, children won't listen"
[13:49:16] <feep[work]> and at the end "careful the things you say / children will listen", where the moral is that kids don't necessarily pick up on what you tell them to *do*, but they do imitate your behavior
[13:50:07] <feep[work]> and that's basically what's going on with clu, right? in that he's explicitly like, kevin's less-loved stepchild
[13:50:40] <feep[work]> and all of the things that happen in the movie can be traced back to kevin's educational fuckups, which then, similarly, clu compounds onto the isos
[13:51:33] <feep[work]> which is why the ending is so heartwrenching, like, it's not like clu only wanted a hug, but it's that on a deeper level, like, he wants to be told he's doing the right thing by his father.
[13:51:55] <feep[work]> fuck. okay. gonna go lunch.
[13:52:29] <saturn2> this tron: legacy video sounds like it's been dynamic range compressed

[19:07:28] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, thats my plan
[19:07:35] <kuudes> but I guess I end up with 13 weeks or so
[19:07:49] <gwern> catern: I doubt cvs would schedule it any later than 5pm so it'd still be hitting while I slept, and that would also kill my grocery selection - things are low at 2PM on sunday, and they'll be much lower at 5pm

[19:10:59] <kuudes> we have now 15.7% test positivity rate

[19:40:32] <kuudes> it is safe to already get booster
[19:40:39] <feep> sure but
[19:40:46] <feep> there is a genuine question of availability
[19:40:48] <kuudes> you do not "need" booster until 6 months per some
[19:40:52] <kuudes> oh?
[19:40:55] <kuudes> how so?

[19:42:26] <kuudes> bah
[19:42:36] <kuudes> that does not matter, there will be plenty of new supply next year
[19:42:43] <kuudes> I thought you guys are running on supplies
[19:42:53] <kuudes> we have 20% of population amount of vaccines now in storage
[19:43:08] <kuudes> helsinki area can't accept new vaccine deliveries because their storages are full
[19:43:28] <kuudes> so I was surprised if germany had managed to shoot all its doses up
[19:43:32] <feep> m
[19:43:38] <feep> I guess it is very optimistic, yeah
[19:44:12] <feep> okay they say a shortening to five months is possible
[19:44:22] <kuudes> yes
[19:44:24] <feep> but I'll still only have four months around christmas
[19:44:34] <kuudes> I got mine at 8 weeks since second dose, because I have conditions
[19:44:49] <kuudes> and I will get a booster at 6 months since second dose as others
[19:45:32] <kuudes> but I strongly recommend to people dear to me that they get as many doses as fast as they can, at least 3; but I am not a doctor
[19:46:04] <kuudes> kids pfizer is just 1/3 of adult pfizer, so you can just inject 1/3 of the syringe to kid
[19:46:24] <kuudes> you don't need to wait for official yellow capped kids doses, they are the same stuff but different preservative and more dilutation
[19:46:45] <kuudes> for under 5 year olds the dosage is 1/10 of adult dose
[19:46:59] <kuudes> but that has not yet been approved in usa either
[19:47:45] <kuudes> feep, I recommend you to swindle yourself a vaccine now at 3 months if it is feasible and does not seem to cause you legal problem enough
[19:48:17] <PapuaHardyNet> feep cannot just walk into a secure medical facility, pick up a vial of moderna, and walk out
[19:48:33] <kuudes> ... the vaccination sites are not that secure
[19:48:50] <PapuaHardyNet> new hitman mission: take a vaccine
[19:49:23] <feep> haha
[19:49:29] <kuudes> if you put on your red team eyeglasses, world seems different
[19:49:37] <feep> honestly, at current rates they'll probably offer boosters to anyone who wants it in a few weeks
[19:49:42] <feep> I'll just wait a bit
[19:49:53] <kuudes> yeah, germany already dropped age limit
[19:50:06] <feep> yeah the problem is germany is very uh          statist?
[19:50:13] <kuudes> though it takes 2 weeks for the vax to become effective
[19:50:18] <feep> like, there's a strong, strong sense of "the system knows what's best for you"
[19:50:34] <kuudes> so if you wait 2 weeks from now, you will be immune in t + 4 weeks
[19:50:37] <feep> right
[19:50:40] <kuudes> yes
[19:50:45] <kuudes> ~same here
[19:51:12] <feep> okay, so if I wait a week, *and* then get a booster, I should have good protection ~ in time for christmas
[19:51:24] <kuudes> nice
[19:51:37] <kuudes> you could also go somewhere to get second first dose
[19:51:46] <feep> okay yes but also no
[19:51:49] <kuudes> indeed
[19:52:24] <feep> at any rate, it's probably okay either way, since I have az+biontech, which is supposed to have good protection even beyond the four month limit
[19:52:27] <kuudes> germany does not have a central registry about the doses given to persons
[19:52:48] <feep> it does have a personal registry that gets checked.
[19:52:49] <kuudes> what age were you again?
[19:52:51] <kuudes> no

[19:53:04] <kuudes> yes but that comes from you

[19:53:12] <kuudes> rki does not keep a registry
[19:53:16] <feep> but >_> <_<
[19:53:29] <kuudes> they specifically proclaim they destroy the data after they make the qr code
[19:53:35] <feep> yes
[19:53:38] <feep> anyway! game things

[19:53:58] <kuudes> >:-)
[19:54:05] <feep> :p
[19:54:23] <kuudes> I am frustrated as we waste vaccination time already
[19:54:46] <kuudes> we can, as it seems any western developed country can, vax at most 1% of population per day for longer duration average
[19:55:08] <kuudes> so each day we allow less than that be vaccinated (currently <0.1%), we gather lag
[19:55:29] <kuudes> even though we have doses for 20% population in storage, it will take 20 days to shoot those up
[19:55:47] <kuudes> 3 weeks is long with covid
[19:56:23] <kuudes> in natural conditions with delta, it is at least 5*5*5 = 125 factor
[19:57:05] <kuudes> with 40% vax waning it would be 3*3*3 = 27x

[21:28:11] <kuudes> ew
[21:28:25] <Gurkenglas> kuudes, i thought the point of legalizing drugs is to delete the black market
[21:28:29] <kuudes> why did you want to punish us with this capisce^?
[21:29:45] <kuudes> Gurkenglas, I don't know
[21:30:09] <kuudes> and I was not talking about legalization but noncarceration
[21:30:26] <capisce^> for science
[21:30:36] <kuudes> ie it is not legal to sell bensin for human consumption, but neither it is a crime to eat bensin
[21:30:59] <Gurkenglas> yeah i suppose your position makes sense from "self harm shouldnt be punished"
[21:31:20] <kuudes> victimless crimes should rarely exist
[21:31:37] <Gurkenglas> once where the victim is yourself :3
[21:31:42] <Gurkenglas> *ones
[21:32:09] <kuudes> then there are situations where legibility of state is not enough to ban, like with alcohol
[21:32:44] <kuudes> but I am ok with finnish weaning strategy, where purchasing tobacco products is made step by step harder and more tedious
[21:33:02] <kuudes> I could envision at some point they would require you for instance to fill out a long form when buying the tobacco
[21:33:29] <Gurkenglas> nooo do it with taxes, not with burning people's time
[21:33:44] <kuudes> no, the point is not to allow rich people to do it either
[21:33:52] <Gurkenglas> then make it a progressive tax
[21:34:01] <kuudes> that won't work because of second hand sales
[21:34:14] <kuudes> but making supply a little more scarce seems to work
[21:34:34] <Gurkenglas> filling out a long form also is vulnerable to second hand sales
[21:34:37] <kuudes> you know, the opposite of one click shopping
[21:35:02] <kuudes> maybe not, you could check the forms with a machine
[21:35:19] <kuudes> basicly proof of work per dose of tobacco products
[21:35:30] <Gurkenglas> i don't follow. rich man tells butler to buy cigarettes
[21:35:51] <kuudes> sure, but some person has lost the hour for the pack
[21:36:04] <Gurkenglas> right! same thing with nonprogressive taxes
[21:36:15] <Gurkenglas> *someone* has labored to produce that dollar's worth of value
[21:36:27] <kuudes> not necessarily
[21:37:00] <kuudes> we fudge money already enough, I don't think it holds that money has minimum worth in time
[21:37:30] <Gurkenglas> maybe invent a second currency, call it "time spent filling out meaningless forms"
[21:37:32] <Gurkenglas> :D
[21:38:02] <Gurkenglas> anyone can fill out meaningless forms to earn 1 unit of it per hour, then sell it to rich people for them to buy tobacco with.
[21:38:22] <kuudes> that still ruins the incentive
[21:38:38] <kuudes> rich people get day fines as well etc
[21:38:44] <Gurkenglas> Indeed! And the incentive is ruined regardless of whether we introduce the rule, because the rich man has a butler
[21:38:50] <Gurkenglas> -rule+second currency
[21:39:11] <Gurkenglas> so we might as well make it a tax
[21:39:53] <kuudes> I don't think so. I presume it would then more easily overflow the grey area where people are too lazy to import it from abroad but it is tedious to get the next fix
[21:40:11] <kuudes> you want to increase the adversity but not so much that they route around it
[21:40:20] <kuudes> so you need to dance in a step with them
[21:40:28] <Gurkenglas> you mean, you're exploiting the nontransitivity of preferences?
[21:40:34] <kuudes> I guess
[21:40:47] <kuudes> conditioning people to avert tobacco products
[21:40:50] <Gurkenglas> because if it's about the *amount* of adversity, you can just do half the tax.
[21:40:58] <kuudes> sort of inverse advertising etc
[21:41:19] <kuudes> we already have price of pack somewhere around 10 e
[21:42:10] <kuudes> I am not sure if we have a minimum price for tobacco
[21:42:59] <kuudes> hmm, tax minimum is 177 e/1000 cigarettes, so 0.177 e/cigarette
[21:43:45] <kuudes> tax percentage is about 50%

[21:58:45] <catern> haaaa nice
[22:00:01] <PapuaHardyNet> that's surprising as a conclusion. I'll read the argument before saying anything
[22:00:59] <ggreer> the live action cowboy bebop is so terrible. bad acting. bad casting. horrible direction and editing. seriously, if three people are pointing guns and spike and he kicks a coin to knock the middle guy out, there should be a shot of the two on either side looking stunned/shocked for a second rather than a shot of them immediately firing with full auto weapons and somehow missing every shot as spike rushes them
[22:01:00] <catern> I've seen those graphs about how US taxation is more progressive before, but that it actually cashes out into being relatively more redistributive is new to me
[22:01:35] <PapuaHardyNet> I see, so the argument is that indirect taxes do not discriminate between income levels of people
[22:01:52] <PapuaHardyNet> which is why european taxation is less redistributive in comparison to US since they have VAT
[22:01:57] <PapuaHardyNet> that is believable

[22:15:22] <feepbot> launch a charm offensive. For example, the president has developed a habit of throwing bags of Turkish tea on unsuspecting crowds at random occasions. The criticism peaked when he was seen doing so from his bus during his summer visit to the fire-hit Aegean region.

[22:24:08] <kuudes> yes, in usa the highest incomes differ from lowest incomes much more than in europe, I would presume
[22:25:37] <kuudes> oh, and in usa also welfare is paid as tax deductions instead of money transfers
[22:25:58] <kuudes> so low income people have much lower net *tax* rate
[22:26:23] <kuudes> whereas at least in finland unemployed people have *higher* tax rate than employed people, but they get low income supplements outside the tax system
[22:27:20] <kuudes> also people of high income still get payments, ie there are constant size payments, such as child benefit which is about 100 e per child
[22:27:35] <kuudes> and bill gates and elon musk would get it if they lived in finland and applied for it

O.K., he decided, it was probably a close call that occurred on El Cap, just after he summited a route called the Salathé Wall. He was staggering toward a tree thirty feet back from the cliff, doing a little victory dance in his head. He was about to tie off a haul bag. Haul bags, full
[23:30:11] <feepbot> of gear, food, and water, are typically about eighty pounds. Caldwell had left this one sitting on a small ledge just under the lip of the cliff, connected by a rope to his harness. Before he reached the tree, he ran out of rope and was jolted to a stop. The jolt dislodged the bag from the ledge. It was a pretty clean fall from there, no significant obstacles for perhaps three
[23:30:11] <feepbot> thousand feet. Caldwell was yanked off his feet and dragged over the rough ground toward the edge. He clawed at bushes and rocks and the earth, sliding backward on his belly, until finally, using every bit of his strength, he managed to stop his progress, his fingers dug into stone. He was alone, and still had to figure out how to secure the bag and not follow it into space. “So
