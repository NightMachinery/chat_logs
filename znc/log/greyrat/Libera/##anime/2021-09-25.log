[00:00:33] <Cryowolf> Aurora_v_kosmose, I'm pretty sure tons of puppies die every minute in the world
[00:00:44] <ButterNoodle> ask north china
[00:01:07] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Cryowolf: Yes. The joke and idea was mostly that it's a horrible pattern to use.
[00:01:16] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, the ones they have in "re-education" camps? :P
[00:01:33] <ButterNoodle> possibly.. you get a ccp bible and a menu that barks
[00:01:45] <JesseDesu> i think i'd be a more productive learner if i stopped chatting in irc
[00:01:51] <MootPoot> does it really matter, half the people here want me red-educated
[00:01:51] <ButterNoodle> naa
[00:01:57] <MootPoot> re-educated
[00:02:00] <ButterNoodle> here?
[00:02:01] <Cryowolf> pretty sure you can find dog anywhere in China, but it's much more rare today than it was during famine
[00:02:19] <ButterNoodle> yea they dont cook it long enough
[00:02:31] <ButterNoodle> its less common in the south
[00:02:39] <ButterNoodle> but holy shit, they love dog in the north
[00:02:54] <Cryowolf> the south has a thing for bats
[00:03:19] <Cryowolf> the northwest prefers goats (Inner Mongolia)
[00:03:25] <JesseDesu> if you make 100k do they tax 40%

[00:03:36] <MootPoot> lo

[00:03:39] <ButterNoodle> once you eat goat u have gone too far norht
[00:03:49] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: no
[00:03:55] <ButterNoodle> no one pays that
[00:03:57] <Cryowolf> JesseDesu, progressive tax means they start taxing on everything you make between certain incomes, not before
[00:04:02] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, we do in Sweden
[00:04:19] <Cryowolf> I think our highest tax is 51% or something like that
[00:04:20] <ButterNoodle> u actually get more for ur tax dollar there
[00:04:47] <Cryowolf> hows that? everything is more expensive here than in the US
[00:04:50] <Cryowolf> except healthcare
[00:05:05] <JesseDesu> i wanna make twice what i make 2 years from now
[00:05:06] <ButterNoodle> everyone wants to complain about taxes.. idc as long as I'm getting something for it.. actual healthcare, retirement..
[00:05:24] <ButterNoodle> yea idk what the situation is there..
[00:05:43] <JesseDesu> i wanna try to get an IT job at the post office
[00:05:50] <ButterNoodle> but you'd thing if the gov is the single bargaining entity to healthcare they can drive prices
[00:05:53] <JesseDesu> where i dont have to deal with people in person
[00:06:04] <ButterNoodle> if they arent in the healthcare companies back pockets :)
[00:06:20] <ButterNoodle> JesseDesu: lol imaging thinking you dont have to deal with people in IT
[00:06:30] <Cryowolf> ButterNoodle, 20 years ago I would have agreed with you
[00:06:43] <ButterNoodle> whats the reason for the high price?
[00:07:27] <Cryowolf> but right now we have a government that fail at allocating our taxes. Nurses, doctors, police, fire fighters etc. All government workers, unless in a specialized field. Receive really poor payment

[00:08:07] <ButterNoodle> thats where all the real idiots go
[00:08:20] <Cryowolf> our import costs make everything cost a ton more than in the US for example
[00:08:32] <ButterNoodle> ic
[00:08:42] <JesseDesu> any idiot can be a people manager
[00:08:45] <Cryowolf> foods I'm not sure, most of our food is either Swedish, Danish or Irish
[00:08:45] <JesseDesu> they just delegate
[00:08:54] <JesseDesu> and they dont know how to actually do anything
[00:09:23] <ButterNoodle> yea JesseDesu there is people skill involved there.. you can only be clueless in management so long before you're fired
[00:09:27] <ButterNoodle> or promoted
[00:10:20] <Cryowolf> JesseDesu, there's a difference between planning and devising a strategy etc and then delegating/allocating the work and just randomly doing it cause you want to play CoD
[00:10:32] <JesseDesu> butternoodle, at the post office they havent utilized machine learning for anything
[00:10:39] <ButterNoodle> do they need to?
[00:10:40] <JesseDesu> everyone is manually editing spreadsheets still
[00:10:42] <Cryowolf> the former being the good manager or boss
[00:10:55] <JesseDesu> and there will probably always be a back end job
[00:11:09] <ButterNoodle> people use spreadsheeets
[00:11:20] <ButterNoodle> its part of life
[00:11:23] <Cryowolf> You know what they often do in Japan instead of firing you? (Which can force them to pay severance etc)
[00:11:26] <JesseDesu> yea
[00:11:32] <Cryowolf> government jobs that is, or salary men jobs
[00:11:33] <JesseDesu> i still gotta pull data manually
[00:11:43] <JesseDesu> edit pivot tables manually, etc
[00:11:49] <ButterNoodle> yea
[00:11:50] <MootPoot> strong pullout game
[00:12:06] <JesseDesu> if i learned vba i could get so much done faster
[00:12:07] <ButterNoodle> I dont like it.. thats someone elses job as far as I'm concerned
[00:12:42] <Cryowolf> they give you a pointless, useless job, where you contribute nothing and your job might actually be to reboot a computer over and over all day
[00:12:50] <Cryowolf> so you quit because of the humiliation
[00:13:30] <ButterNoodle> here we are bitching about excel.. and I'm playing copy/paste on excel
[00:13:51] <ButterNoodle> so I can send it to someone so that they can copy/paste into a quick request system
[00:14:04] <ButterNoodle> so someone else can copy and paste into a provisioning platform
[00:14:35] <ButterNoodle> so someone else can copy/paste into a ticket when completed, and send to me so I can copy/paste into another excel
[00:14:53] <Cryowolf> I'm good at coming up with a strategy, delegating it to those best suited for the job (or is that allocating?) and then directing the project to make sure everything is going smoothly while I continue to deal with new information, obstacles, issues and so on. What I'm not good at, is quickly delegating people because of their assigned job title and then going to sleep
[00:15:06] <ButterNoodle> yes
[00:15:25] <Cryowolf> I'm also not good at keeping a job
[00:15:27] <ButterNoodle> in management, we reward people that are over achievers and highly productive
[00:15:29] <Cryowolf> not because I'm bad at it
[00:15:44] <ButterNoodle> by giving them more work so they are as productive as the slackers
[00:15:47] <Cryowolf> but because I have this difficult time harnessing focus
[00:16:42] <JesseDesu> people who are loud, interrupt, and have one sided arguments where they dont listen are promoted to management

[00:23:33] <Cryowolf> A 3d game about breaking out of a prison would be pretty good, having different missions based on different prisons. In each one you play a different prisoner, because otherwise you'd sometimes be 300 years old

[00:47:47] <JesseDesu> is it better to setup a local webserver with a docker image
[00:57:57] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Not necessarily, no.
[00:58:18] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Docker is intended to facilitate deployment of software bundles. It's not a security solution.
[00:58:41] <Aurora_v_kosmose> So if you're asking "is it better for security", the answer is no. If it's "is it better for automation?" the answer is mostly yes.
[00:58:54] <JesseDesu> i wasnt asking about security
[00:58:59] <JesseDesu> just in general
[00:59:38] <Aurora_v_kosmose> In general it's not any worse or better, but if you want to buy extra-fussy it's slightly worse than doing without, as there's at least one more virtual network hop in the path slowing things down ever so slightly.

[03:52:15] <MootPoot> I wonder
[03:52:25] <ButterNoodle> my cat shit
[03:52:31] <ButterNoodle> poop came out of its ass hole
[03:52:36] <ButterNoodle> and it was stank
[03:52:42] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: do you know shit about home wiring
[03:52:55] <ButterNoodle> like electrical
[03:52:58] <MootPoot> y
[03:53:00] <MootPoot> es
[03:53:04] <ButterNoodle> sure.. more on the industrial stuff tho
[03:53:13] <MootPoot> Do all houses have like
[03:53:18] <MootPoot> a common wall/electrical column
[03:53:23] <ButterNoodle> no
[03:53:26] <MootPoot> that wires go up and down
[03:53:28] <MootPoot> no?
[03:53:31] <MootPoot> fuck
[03:54:04] <MootPoot> I wanna get some cat 7 wired from the top of my house to the bottom
[03:54:15] <ButterNoodle> typically the shortest path to complete the circuit
[03:54:25] <MootPoot> I know my ISP coax that comes in at the bottom is wired all the way to up here as well
[03:54:36] <MootPoot> so I know some wire makes it up here
[03:54:39] <ButterNoodle> it probably better that it isnt for emi
[03:54:45] <ButterNoodle> hat trick
[03:54:56] <ButterNoodle> tie pull string to one end of the coax...
[03:55:22] <MootPoot> I wonder if its worth calling an electrician for this or someth
[03:55:40] <ButterNoodle> and pull through, then attach another pull coax and bundle of cat7 and pull back through
[03:55:46] <ButterNoodle> I mean
[03:55:50] <ButterNoodle> depends on $$
[03:56:02] <ButterNoodle> if someone will do it for $200 its worth it
[03:56:27] <MootPoot> it gotta go down like 3 stories tho
[03:56:32] <MootPoot> second floor to basement
[03:56:32] <ButterNoodle> yea
[03:56:40] <ButterNoodle> $200 usd is all I'd pay
[03:56:45] <ButterNoodle> since they already have the tools
[03:57:02] <ButterNoodle> u could get a fiberglass pole off of amazon for $30
[03:57:15] <ButterNoodle> and fish it up urself
[03:57:51] <MootPoot> problem is idk if its a straight fish or not
[03:58:06] <MootPoot> I'm pretty sure it goes loopty loop at some point
[03:58:19] <ButterNoodle> how did they run that coax
[03:58:25] <MootPoot> idk
[03:58:34] <MootPoot> this house was built in 06
[03:58:38] <MootPoot> I moved in here in like
[03:58:39] <MootPoot> 201 5
[04:00:08] <ButterNoodle> I'd bet that coax is a straight run
[04:00:23] <MootPoot> it comes out at like 3 different spots tho
[04:00:26] <MootPoot> that I know of
[04:00:28] <MootPoot> maybe more
[04:00:34] <ButterNoodle> tf
[04:00:52] <ButterNoodle> is there a splitter in the wall?
[04:00:57] <MootPoot> probably
[04:01:09] <MootPoot> wait, no
[04:01:13] <MootPoot> 4 points I know of
[04:01:24] <MootPoot> ISP coax comes into the basement electrical panel
[04:01:34] <ButterNoodle> maybe goes to the attic and then splits
[04:01:40] <MootPoot> 1 coax out in the basement, 1 on second floor, 2 on third
[04:01:47] <MootPoot> its going bottom up tho
[04:01:50] <MootPoot> not top to down
[04:01:59] <MootPoot> underground wiring
[04:02:07] <ButterNoodle> single coax in the basement
[04:02:26] <ButterNoodle> yea buried cable to the 2nd floor
[04:03:05] <MootPoot> I wanna move a lot of my computer shit to the basement since I dont got room up here for all of it

[07:42:02] <Nanobot> I added LIFO support to my tax planning spreadsheet. I can now toggle between FIFO and LIFO with just a boolean.
[07:42:33] <Nanobot> The difference in the final amount after taxes is.... currently not significant.
[07:44:39] <Nanobot> LIFO is slightly beneficial for me under the 2020 tax rules. The 2021 tax rules are not yet known, but I've been assuming Biden's plan (which I'm assuming would have taxed me more heavily than whatever Congress ends up passing).

[18:01:09] <wikifurry-46> 3 days old, yes 👍 😅
[18:01:20] <Sadale> Welcome to IRC and have fun! :3 Most users barely use any emoji on IRC. Mainly because IRC is an old piece of technology, and most users aren't using it on phone. And it isn't common for computers to have an emoji keyboard. Just saying. It's ok to use them if you want. :3
[18:01:23] <wikifurry-46> Sadale
[18:01:36] <Sadale> Have fun here! :3
[18:02:00] <wikifurry-46> 😆
[18:02:09] <wikifurry-46> 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 
[18:02:40] <wikifurry-46> Lol thanks 😊 Sadale will do 
[18:04:41] <Sadale> wikifurry-46, where have you first heard of IRC? It isn't common for new people to discover it.
[18:05:05] <Sadale> Most people would discover stuffs like Discord or Instagram or Twitter or Reddit easily. But not IRC networks like Libera
[18:05:43] <ImoutoBot> New episode for: Bokutachi no Remake | Episode: 12
[18:06:06] <amigojapan> wikifurry-46: also not everyone can see the emojis
[18:06:47] <Bco1981> if you deal witg linut you often get hints of "get help here at ... irc.freenode.net #some-linux-or-opensource-program-related channel."
[18:06:56] <Bco1981> with linux*
[18:07:06] <DaPinkOne> freenode's gone though. all those people are here
[18:07:07] <wikifurry-46> Sadale i was on wiki furry,  looking for web comics artists who are women, and found a link to here for chat 
[18:07:44] <Bco1981> well i have been looking up slackware stuff the last 12 ish hours and... they still point to freenode
[18:07:50] <Sadale> I see :3
[18:08:37] <wikifurry-46> Libera=no email, no sign up, just jump in as guests = i have found my place 
[18:08:45] <Sadale> sad to see freenode die
[18:08:52] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: I have made the mistake many times of calling here "freenode" too
[18:09:12] <Sadale> wikifurry-46, In case you didn't know tho your IP address is public here. You could apply for a cloak after registering your nick tho
[18:09:25] <Sadale> With a cloak people wouldn't be able to view your IP address.
[18:09:30] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, it pretty much is, by another name. most of the same staff are running it, and most of the organizations did move over relatively smoothly
[18:09:41] <Sadale> Here's the command to view other's IP address if they aren't cloaked: /whois <username>
[18:10:00] <amigojapan> Right DaPinkOne 
[18:10:13] <wikifurry-46> Noted ✅  maybe after the new year, 
[18:11:11] <DaPinkOne> wikifurry-46, you should probably register with nickserv
[18:11:18] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: I think for this channel it was probably a good thing
[18:12:22] <DaPinkOne> amigojapan, I dunno. this community had a large schism a while back with many people moving to discord, and many said they wanted to stay on FN. I dunno if they ever came over
[18:13:11] <DaPinkOne> the shakeup of the ops/founders might have been good, but I'm not a part of that group
[18:13:15] <amigojapan> DaPinkOne: I am glad those People are gone
[18:13:18] <wikifurry-46> Im kinda in limbo atm gotta wait for the new year, its not fun 😕, but I'll manage, 
[18:13:41] <DaPinkOne> wikifurry-46, the new year is 3 months out. Any particular reason to wait?
[18:14:30] <DaPinkOne> what do you mean by limbo?
[18:15:22] <wikifurry-46> My legitimate port to the digital realm is in the shop, so to speak, im using borrowed, 
[18:15:41] <DaPinkOne> ah, alright
[18:18:53] <amigojapan> wikifurry-46: if you write down all the information and the password, you can use the registered nickname on any computer
[18:19:24] <Sadale> well, it's up to him/her. If he doesn't wnat to do that it's k :3
[18:19:42] <amigojapan> Ok
[18:20:20] <Sadale> DaPinkOne, I remember those days. A couple of people created a discord server and drained quite a few users away :(
[18:20:27] <Sadale> looking at you davic :P
[18:21:13] <wikifurry-46> amigojapan i shall consider it 
[18:21:35] <amigojapan> Alright wikifurry-46 
[18:21:38] <DaPinkOne> haven't heard the discord mentioned in quite some time though.
[18:21:48] <DaPinkOne> maybe it collapsed and they came back
[18:22:26] <amigojapan> Sadale: I don't think you want to start inter op drama
[18:22:45] <Sadale> amigojapan, lol don't worry davic knows me well. We're just trolling each others.
[18:22:54] <amigojapan> Ok
