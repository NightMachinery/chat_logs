[16:49:51] <ii14[m]> dchuri: you implement on_detach callback. or is it done already mjlbach?
[16:49:59] <clason[m]> BennyPowers[m]: No.
[16:50:33] <ii14[m]> * dchuri: you can implement on_detach
[16:50:33] <clason[m]> sounds like something might interfere with your filetype detection
[16:53:37] <BennyPowers[m]> clason: thanks. i found this too https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/12649
[16:55:34] <clason[m]> Yes. That's what sunjon was getting at: (Neo)vim has been around for a long time; for all your initial questions, there's a 99% chance that they've been asked and answered before (some quite often...), which a (sometimes not so) quick Github or Google search will show you.
[16:56:38] <clason[m]> So it's considered common courtesy to (seriously) try that first -- much as I understand preferring the human touch of asking random strangers on the internet ;)
[17:01:25] <BennyPowers[m]> of course
[17:01:38] <BennyPowers[m]> but since i'm a newbie, I don't always know the right search terms 
[17:02:16] <nub> the autocmmand runs when i run :set filetype=lua (which is already set!) but not when i open vim/the file
[17:02:58] <clason[m]> neither do we, most of the time -- that's why we try a couple, see what sticks, and refine (and follow links) from there 
[17:15:50] <nub> wtf i figured it out - `:lua vim.api.nvim_command('au FileType lua unsilent set nornu')` doesn't work, `:au FileType lua unsilent set nornu` does

[17:26:44] <nub> found where it's breaking
[17:26:54] <nub> this is a dumb question - can you have more than one autocmd for the same filetype?
[17:27:25] <nub> this is the config that's stopping the autocmds from executing - https://github.com/callumacrae/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/config/plugin-config/prettier.vim
[17:28:34] <clason[m]> sure, they run in the order they are defined
[17:29:04] <clason[m]> but there are some footguns, like having an `au!` outside of autogroups
[17:30:15] <nub> putting au FileType lua unsilent set nonu at the top of that file works, putting it at the bottom does not
[17:31:54] <clason[m]> does it work at the bottom if you remove the other autocommands (or replace them by `echo 'foo'`)?
[17:32:03] <nub> it works when what's currently on line 9 is commented out, commenting out line 4 has no effect
[17:32:12] <clason[m]> might need `<bar>` instead of the literal pipe

[18:34:20] <coldspark29Jan[m> Any idea why autosourcing the .vimrc results in the saving getting slower each time? I was hoping that this Vim behavior would be fixed in Neovim
[18:34:20] <coldspark29Jan[m> ```
[18:34:20] <coldspark29Jan[m> autocmd bufwritepost .vimrc source $MYVIMRC
[18:34:20] <coldspark29Jan[m> ```
[18:35:08] <coldspark29Jan[m> Is there some better way to achieve this maybe?
[18:35:24] <clason[m]> Why would it? It does exactly what you tell it to: execute that script again
[18:35:28] <clason[m]> Autocommands are never overwritten, just added.
[18:35:42] <nub> ya i was gonna say, isn't that by definition a leak of some sort?
[18:35:58] <nub> use a group and remove them again before adding new ones
[18:36:12] <clason[m]> coldspark29Jan[m: Yes, restart Nvim after making changes to the config.
[18:36:21] <nub> or that lol
[18:36:23] <coldspark29Jan[m> Duh 😃
[18:36:24] <coldspark29Jan[m> I am lazy though

[18:44:09] <ii14[m]> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14535 https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/16250
[18:44:40] <coldspark29Jan[m> How is that different?
[18:44:40] <ii14[m]> basically on_detach callback in lsp client settings, just like there is a on_attach, on_exit etc
[18:45:05] <nub> coldspark29Jan[m: quits nvim when you change your .vimrc, then the shell starts a new instance
[18:45:15] <nub> i mean it's shitty and you shouldn't do it, but it's better than what you were doing before lol
[18:45:24] <dchuri[m]> Looks like it's already implemented though
[18:46:07] <ii14[m]> I don't see it
[18:46:42] <coldspark29Jan[m> I have the one from before from Vimcasts actually
[18:46:50] <coldspark29Jan[m> Maybe this is a solution https://github.com/jenterkin/vim-autosource
[18:47:41] * dchuri[m] uploaded an image: (9KiB) < https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/YtzvzIzAHQOqrJHfKOaTwFEM/image.png >
[18:47:49] <ii14[m]> that's a different thing
[18:47:49] <dchuri[m]> I think that's the one, or it's a completely different thing
[18:48:13] <nub> coldspark29Jan[m: do you understand why it's getting slower? because i already told you a solution that will help somewhat
[18:48:42] <ii14[m]> basically when you call `vim.lsp.buf_detach_client`, there should be some user defined callback
[18:48:55] <ii14[m]> it's when client detaches from the buffer
[18:49:00] <ii14[m]> the opposite of on_attach
[18:49:04] <nub> i presume the autocmd you posted about is in your vimrc, which means that if you save 50 times, there will be 50 autocmds that run when you save that file - the solution is to add it as a group and remove the old group before you try to add it again
[18:50:44] <nub> actually that's wrong, if you save 50 times there will be 50 factorial autocmds xD
[18:51:19] <coldspark29Jan[m> Okay so I have to exclude the autocommands from being sourced
[18:52:03] <clason[m]> among other things
[18:52:04] <clason[m]> Vim is just not built for hot-reloading
[18:52:04] <ii14[m]> no, you just have to stop doing this
[18:52:04] <coldspark29Jan[m> Maybe add them to the autoload directory
[18:52:16] <coldspark29Jan[m> Haha
[18:52:19] <coldspark29Jan[m> I won't
[18:52:49] <ii14[m]> then deal with leaks and bugs
[18:52:53] <nub> yeah you can work around the problem somewhat but the real problem is still a problem
[18:53:28] <jaawerth[m]> Curious if he addressed that in vimscript2, seems like a good opportunity to make it so the stacking autocommands have to be something you do explicitly rather than accidentally
[18:53:56] <clason[m]> I'd be surprised if it's different in Vim9Script...
[18:53:57] <clason[m]> (the `filetype.vim` design very much relies on this behavior)
[18:54:47] <nub> i mean i guess you could check to see if there's an autocmd added with the same command, but that's weird
[18:55:04] <nub> and at best you could only give a warning anyway, or you'd break too much stuff

[20:00:24] <kylo252[m]> .. as the conclusion of why it's not exactly implemented
[20:01:45] <ii14[m]> the problem is when you set some things up in on_attach callback and then you want to clean it up when buffer is detached
[20:02:01] <ii14[m]> and that can be just a single buffer, no entire client

[20:10:04] <kylo252[m]> I do agree that it should be configurable, tho the tone or my response may indicate otherwise 
[20:10:18] <ii14[m]> that are specific to buffers attached to lsp client
[20:10:47] <kylo252[m]> and what are some instances where you want to detach a buffer but not kill the server?
[20:11:19] <ii14[m]> when buffer is attached by accident
[20:11:53] <kylo252[m]> how often would a buffer get attached by accident with a server that you still need to keep alive? 
[20:11:54] <ii14[m]> you might have some c library for example, and you don't have generated compile_commands.json for it
[20:12:19] <ii14[m]> often enough for me
[20:12:52] <ii14[m]> when I have 20 files opened, I don't want to kill the server and manually re attach each buffer I want
[20:13:10] <kylo252[m]> as I said, to me this is a nice to have, but I still don't see how often you would need it
[20:14:25] <ii14[m]> I mean I need it quite often, I don't know what else to say
[20:14:34] <kylo252[m]> hmm, now that I think about it, I'm starting to see your point of where you want to detach a buffer
[20:14:34] <kylo252[m]> but that still doesn't explain the need for the detach callback, because you shouldn't be too worried about that "temp" file
[20:15:13] <ii14[m]> to revert the stuff I'm setting up in on_attach
[20:15:22] <ii14[m]> it's not necessarily a temporary file
[20:15:35] <ii14[m]> just a file that's outside of the project, but lsp thinks it's inside the project
[20:15:42] <kylo252[m]> as far as I can tell, you can already implement this without waiting for it in core
[20:16:04] <ii14[m]> like just a dependency or something
[20:16:05] <ii14[m]> and I get million of errors
[20:16:29] <kylo252[m]> yeah, I know that feeling with clangd when it loses its mind about some header
[20:17:38] <ii14[m]> kinda, I guess. by making sure that I don't ever miss when buffer is detached
[20:18:01] <kylo252[m]> but there are other side-effects that I usually have to deal with as well. for example: it's not enough to detach the buffer, you also need to remove that auto-attach that's set by lspconfig
[20:18:02] <ii14[m]> but you can make the same reasoning for on_exit

[20:19:24] <ii14[m]> but you can't specify what buffers you want to automatically attach to (or not), right?
[20:19:47] <kylo252[m]> you can, but then you need to manage it manually
[20:20:05] <ii14[m]> so the solution is to write my own lspconfig
[20:21:26] <kylo252[m]> more like try to find the pattern that you need for specific servers. because writing another lspconfig is still hard knowing all of this. so many people want/need plug-n-play and, and having too many knobs will only make this harder

[20:24:11] <kylo252[m]> attaching and detaching (request for) files isn't really something that needs to be configured beforehand AFAIK, so you can create a custom detach command with all that you need. the only difference is that you would call it directly instead of `vim.lsp.buf.detach__()`
[20:24:32] <kylo252[m]> ii14[m]: the custom handler I'm suggesting has nothing to do with lspconfig, it comes directly from the protocol and neovim cannot really remove it if it wants to be compliant 
[20:27:33] <ii14[m]> you mean `textDocument/didClose`?
[20:27:39] <ii14[m]> can you even add a callback for that?
[20:27:56] <ii14[m]> callback/handler
[20:30:17] <mjlbach[m]> didClose is a notification

[20:32:27] <kylo252[m]> there's a global state deps it seems
[20:33:05] <ii14[m]> yes, nvim keeps track of that with tables like `all_buffer_active_clients` that are private
[20:33:15] <kylo252[m]> one of them doesn't seem private, let me try it 
[20:33:35] <ii14[m]> they are local variables, so private

[21:41:00] <kraftwerk28> What is the correct way to load color themes through packer.nvim? With my current approach (async loading) it breaks my ftplugin / after/ftplugin custom syntax files.

[21:46:21] <clason[m]> depends on the "color theme"
[21:46:37] <clason[m]> most of the new ones are full plugins rather than the classical Vim colorschemes
[21:48:05] <clason[m]> But I feel compelled to add that the best way is to avoid "async loading" like the plague. It adds little (over being careful what to require and when) and potentially breaks so much
[21:48:17] <clason[m]> especially around highlighting, which is deeply baked into Neovim.
[21:48:37] <clason[m]> If you must shave milliseconds, use https://github.com/lewis6991/impatient.nvim
