[19:34:51] <dsc_> epilys: i bought a nvidia 3080 at 900euros and people called me crazy
[19:35:10] <dsc_> fast-forward few months ... it was twice that ;/
[19:35:41] <dsc_> to be fair 900euros for a graphics card is also stupid
[19:36:02] <dsc_> only a few years ago when a 400euro graphics card was considered top of the line
[19:36:17] <epilys> why would you do that :|
[19:36:23] <wink> I paid 600 for my 3070
[19:36:33] <wink> I consider myself very lucky
[19:36:43] <dsc_> that is indeed lucky
[19:36:51] <wink> but I checked a thread of new offers in local shops liek 10x per day
[19:36:52] <dsc_> 900eu for 3080 is also lucky
[19:36:59] <wink> also it was in december
[19:37:05] <wink> JUST before the complete craziness
[19:37:30] <dsc_> bought mine in november
[19:37:35] <wink> I also think it was like twice than what I had ever paid before
[19:37:43] <wink> I usually got the second latest generation
[19:37:57] <dsc_> 3070s go for 800 right now
[19:38:05] <dsc_> few months ago they were 1200
[19:38:16] <dsc_> its all over the place really
[19:38:17] <wink> but I had my last PC from 2012 until 2019, so I thought: if I don't replace it again for 7 years... might as well egt the expensive card
[19:38:32] <epilys> fear not, people. the free market will sort this out
[19:38:44] <wink> it would have without the damn miners
[19:38:57] <dsc_> i never had a good graphics card because never had money, only since recent times I have money for such expensive hardware
[19:39:01] <wink> you buy them for work or games, but not to directly earn money
[19:39:26] <wink> directly as in.. scales with number of cards. ofc you could have 2-4 in a graphics workstation

[19:40:38] <wink> so yes, I replaced the card in the middle of the 2012-19 PC
[19:40:47] <wink> but it also wasn't more than 250 or so
[19:40:53] <wink> likely less
[19:41:42] <wink> also if pc gaming is one of your main hobbies I don't find the price outrageous

[19:42:00] <wink> my machine was 1500 without screens.
[19:42:16] <dsc_> a graphics card above 400eu is still outrageous in my opinion
[19:42:17] <wink> that's... a 2 week vacation for many people
[19:43:05] <dsc_> a 3080 costs 1400 right now, that's 1 (or 2) months income for many people
[19:43:13] <manicennui> How are you going on vacation for 2 weeks for 400eu?
[19:43:13] <dsc_> i mean cmon
[19:44:08] <manicennui> 1400 isn't a hardship for me, but I would never spend more than a few hundred.
[19:44:23] <dsc_> right
[19:44:43] <manicennui> Which probably means I won't be buying another Nvidia card for a long time.
[19:44:55] <rhn> totally depends on *where* you go on vacation
[19:45:12] <rhn> and what kind of vacation
[19:45:29] <manicennui> Hard to even fly anywhere here for less than a couple hundred USD.
[19:45:31] <dsc_> anyway, I love my 3080. I can throw everything I want at it, at 4k. Quite nice.
[19:45:36] <manicennui> Then rent a car, hotel, food, etc.
[19:46:50] <manicennui> For 400 EU I assume you'd have to stay in hostel, be able to take a cheap train to get there, and eat from dumpsters?
[19:50:08] <wink> everyone has their own limits. 600 was basically my upper limit unless I had searched for another month, then maybe 650
[19:50:21] <wink> all the years before that my limit was 300-350
[19:50:30] <epilys> damn people, sorry to say it but check your privilege a bit. Most people live in poverty
[19:50:54] <epilys> (not attacking anyone)
[19:51:25] <wink> we're talking about a certain kind of hardware though.
[19:51:45] <wink> when I say "not outrageous" I compare it to other hw, in this case for gaming
[19:51:58] <wink> I never said it wasn't a lot of money
[19:52:36] <wink> but comparing it to local salaries for developers, which is kinda my impression 3/4 of people here are... it's simply not outrageous.
[19:53:07] <wink> of course I am happy I can afford it, but I've bought more expensive hardware when working as a student 20y ago
[19:53:20] <wink> just needed to save up many more months
[19:53:21] <epilys> I'm talking about the vacations bit
[19:53:28] <epilys> minimum wage in Greece is 600~ euros
[19:54:22] <wink> yeah, but if not everything is messed up you can still go on vacation
[19:55:03] <wink> when we looked at local hotels in august, there wasn't a lot of free rooms and some hotels had like 500 EUR for 2 nights for 2 people.
[19:55:08] <wink> which is kinda very expensive
[19:55:24] <wink> but only in relation to local wages, not to 600 eur monthly
[19:55:32] <wink> (suffice to say, ofc we did not go)
[19:56:43] <manicennui> epilys: Sure, but how does someone go on vacation for 400 EU?
[19:57:04] <rhn> first: don't fly
[19:57:05] <wink> but I get your point, I think it would be more useful to put it as "x % of my monthly income, for a 1 week vacation"
[19:57:10] <companion_cube> if you already have a house to go to, that's the fuel + toll :p
[19:57:26] <manicennui> companion_cube: If you are poor are you likely to have a vacation home?
[19:57:31] <manicennui> Or do you mean relatives or something?
[19:57:35] <epilys> 400 eu for two weeks is possible in greece, for example
[19:57:37] <ben> visiting friends/family
[19:57:40] <rhn> although you might get away with flying, as flights can be 50 EUR both ways
[19:58:19] <rhn> then find a cheap destination country, and you're done
[19:58:22] <companion_cube> manicennui: heh, I'm mostly kidding
[19:58:57] <manicennui> rhn: In the US getting to that cheap country would eat up your entire budget.
[19:59:03] <manicennui> You can fly to Florida for pretty cheap.
[19:59:14] <manicennui> Maybe $125 round trip.
[19:59:23] <manicennui> But everything else is going to cost money.
[19:59:49] <wink> is it really a vacation if "florida man" ruins it for you? :P
[20:00:49] <companion_cube> you can fly to florida and live on alligator flesh

[20:23:50] <epilys> but openbsd returned the blowfish color, so that single one was not a failure

[23:13:54] <bkero> Have you met him in person?
[23:14:01] <ngoldbaum> i guess blindsight is better
[23:14:05] <ngoldbaum> and that was 2006
[23:14:47] <varjag> read the original!

[23:14:59] <varjag> jaynes?
[23:15:30] <varjag> bicameral mind
[23:15:44] <companion_cube> bkero: no, but his writing and blog are ok, I think
[23:15:50] <companion_cube> Simmons writes some weird shit
[23:16:15] <bkero> He's kind of a jerk in person
[23:16:29] <indigo> The Hyperion Cantos is awesome
[23:16:31] <drobilla> ngoldbaum: Oh?  I did a quick google to check if he was an Orson-Scott-Card level piece of shit but didn't find really anything so figured whatever
[23:16:32] <bkero> We had dinner at Cthulu-con and a few other times.
[23:16:34] <indigo> Really enjoyed those books
[23:16:38] <bkero> *and I met him a few other times
[23:16:43] <ngoldbaum> drobilla: http://file770.com/wp-content/uploads/Dan-Simmons-screencap.jpg
[23:16:48] <ngoldbaum> just one example
[23:17:16] <drobilla> jesus
[23:17:32] <ngoldbaum> based on strossâ€™ twitter presence he doesnâ€™t seem like a particularly nice guy, especially if he doesnâ€™t like you
[23:17:43] <kline> this feels vaguely like a topic for the satellite channels
[23:20:09] *** Quits: besnn (~besnn@user/besnn) (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[23:20:09] <bkero> Yeah he refused to shake my hand when I introduced myself, lol. Just stared at me with a bit of detest.
[23:20:16] <companion_cube> :D okay
[23:20:37] <bkero> He's really not a fan of techbros
[23:20:54] <bkero> and I'm guessing I give off that odor
[23:21:21] <kline> eau d'bro
[23:21:36] <technomancy> I could barely slog thru the one stross book I tried but I keep hearing I should try some others
[23:21:52] <ngoldbaum> i like his early stuff and the rule 34 series
[23:22:09] <ngoldbaum> i also liked the first laundry files book but couldnâ€™t get into subsequent chapters
[23:22:17] <chenghiz_> accelerando is great
[23:22:20] <ngoldbaum> perhaps because the literary references escaped me
[23:22:24] <companion_cube> glasshouse too
[23:22:25] <bkero> He told me that he wrote Accelerando (usually what I recommend new readres) as therapy after his long stint in compliance sysadminning for the credit card transaction infrastructure companies.
[23:22:27] <technomancy> accelerando is awful
[23:22:38] <varjag> technomancy++
[23:22:40] <bkero> It's also the book he's most ashamed of now.
[23:22:41] <technomancy> just super tedious with unlikeable characters
[23:22:51] <bkero> "nobody wants uploaded lobsters"
[23:22:51] <ngoldbaum> singularity sky was fun
[23:22:58] <technomancy> bkero: haha well that makes me more inclined to read his other books!
[23:23:36] <technomancy> his talk here was pretty great http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/01/dude-you-broke-the-future.html

[23:29:11] <bkero> He rails on crypto pretty hard, pissed off a few of my friends.

[23:43:03] <pja> Have to say I didnâ€™t get on with Hyperion.
[23:43:19] <HankHill> technomancy: Yeah I'd recc Glasshouse or Halting State by Stross
[23:43:24] <HankHill> Some of his better work
[23:43:28] <HankHill> Laundry Files is good but long
[23:43:35] <HankHill> Like 10 books now and a spin off series
[23:43:43] <ddoug> stross' stuff is highly masturbatory
[23:43:48] <pja> technomancy: tsk. Accelerando is great. But itâ€™s not a novel, more a loosely connected string of short stories, each taking the previous one as a jumping off point into the future.
[23:44:26] <pja> Iâ€™ve kind of got bored of his Laundry Files output. Doubt Iâ€™ll read the next one.
[23:44:35] <HankHill> pja: I mean yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[23:44:40] <pja> First few are great though.
[23:44:45] <HankHill> Short stories compiled into a novel.
[23:45:07] <pja> HankHill: I think they were published in an online magazine first?
[23:45:15] <pja> Or even print? Canâ€™t remember.
[23:45:26] <HankHill> Print first
[23:45:50] <pja> His collaboration with Cory Doctorow is mad, but kind of fun.
[23:46:22] <HankHill> Yeah it's a good one
[23:46:31] <HankHill> Shows how much he's tired of transhumanist stuff heh
