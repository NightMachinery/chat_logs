[00:03:26] <joshproehl> Is there a good guide for setting up fixtures for testing a phoenix app, specifically relating to associations? There seem to be some different opinions about it, and I'm looking to clean up some messy tests and keep it as idiomatic as possible. 
[00:06:56] <joshproehl> (I'm currently thinking something like https://ejpcmac.net/blog/sharing-fixtures-between-test-modules-in-elixir/ is the best approach)

[00:33:06] <benwilson512> joshproehl: I would say most phoenix testing eschews shared fixtures for tests
[00:33:21] <benwilson512> depending on what you mean by fixtures I guess
[00:33:46] <Ankhers> Does anyone have experience with sourcelevel.io or similar services? Just wondering which services is "better" for elixir projects.
[00:35:59] <joshproehl> benwilson512: Well, if I have an Event which has Attendees, every test for an Attendee has to create an parent Event created. My current problem is that attendee_controller_test has code that's creating Events, and so does event_controller_test... That duplication began to irritate me when I made a change to Event and had to go update the fixtures for event in multiple places. :-)
[00:36:34] <benwilson512> joshproehl: ah I see what you mean
[00:37:20] <benwilson512> the convention I've seen around that is to create helper modules in `test/support/` that contain helper functions for setting up groups of entities
[00:37:27] <benwilson512> that you can then call from multiple test modules
[00:38:09] <benwilson512> eg `test/support/event_helpers.ex` in which you could have `EventHelpers.create(params)` that you call from both controller tests
[00:38:28] <benwilson512> and in general those helper functions should generally call your context functions as opposed to inserting events or attendees into the DB directly
[00:41:46] <joshproehl> Pretty similar to putting create_event(params) and create_attendee(params) in test/support/fixtures.ex. The callout to use the context functions rather than direct Repo.insert()s is a good one though.
[00:42:30] <benwilson512> so to me the difference between a fixture and a helper is that a fixture always inserts the same data
[00:42:52] <benwilson512> a helper accepts parameters from the test case and will insert different data depending on what is passed
[00:53:23] <joshproehl> I definitely see the point there, would rather build the entire object and then test the controller's return value against that all in one nice place, no magic fixture values coming from another file. I'll have a think about the helpers idea, thanks for the input!

[06:01:19] <mekhami> what kind of quality of life, tooling, etc should i bake right in at the beginning
[06:01:45] <rawtaz> there are quite a few podcast episodes about that type of thing
[06:01:47] <mekhami> my thoughts are; make sure testing is absolutely painless, fast, and useful. lay out telemetry stuff and document it so people know how that stuff works
[06:02:58] <mekhami> should i get dialyzer going right from the start or leave it for later etc

[15:28:07] <maymay> in LiveView, I see the component lifecycle is preload(list_of_assigns) -> mount(socket) -> update(assigns, socket) -> render(assigns)
[15:28:31] <maymay> does that means there's no way to get the current user (from session or assigns) to use in a query in preload?
[15:30:17] <benwilson512> maymay: `list_of_assigns` seems to say you could put the current user as an assign right?
[15:32:13] <maymay> right, let me try to assign it manually on that component (I usually grab it from surface's __context__)
[15:37:23] <maymay> yep :) thanks benwilson512 
[15:38:17] <maymay> basically you can use assigns passed by the parent, not anything set by the component's own mount or update

[18:48:40] <rawtaz> Nicd: i disagree. if someone rotates in and out of a room with a bunch of people, those people shouldnt have to try to ignore that. instead the real cause of the problem should be solved - this is basic irc netiquette
[18:49:05] <rawtaz> i *want* to see when people join and leave, so i cant just hide all of that. and i dont want to ignore individuals either
[18:49:14] <rawtaz> its better they just fix their connection, theres no reason not to
[18:50:23] <mayhew> rawtaz: there's a reason modern platforms like Discord and Slack don't show those messages. They're terrible UX and just noise.
[18:50:43] <rawtaz> mayhew: so you are saying that there is no interest or value in knowing who enters and leaves a room?
[18:50:53] <mayhew> I have my client configured so I only see joins/parts from someone that has written in the channel recently. That seems like a solid default.
[18:51:09] <rawtaz> i think that the opinion that this information is just terrible UX and noise is an individual one :)
[18:51:20] <rawtaz> how recently, if i may ask?
[18:51:44] <rawtaz> it wont show the newcomer who never was in the channel before and that one might want to greet

[18:52:34] <rawtaz> err, hard*
[18:53:37] <rawtaz> i hear what youre saying though, we just think differently regarding the value in those messages and how to use them in different ways and/or not at all :)
[18:54:21] <rawtaz> but i still think that basic netiquette still applies, and that includes not spamming a channel with joins and quits or similar

[18:55:23] <mayhew> rawtaz: I'm not too sure, I use Konversation and can't find where it's configured right now (too many menus). I'm not saying there's *zero* value, but it seems fairly small to me. Seems like a losing battle, not everyone is an IRC pro or computer savvy. I definitely prefer not to see that noise (by default anyways).

[18:57:05] <rawtaz> one doesnt have to be an irc pro or computer savvy IMO, but if you think so.
[18:58:23] <mayhew> even someone computer savvy may have their IRC client set to auto-run on boot, and if they're tinkering with their machine such that they're constantly rebooting / logging in, they may be unintentionally spamming the channels with joins/parts. I've probably done that before and I consider myself somewhat computer savvy.

[19:06:29] <czard> Hi :wave: Just started following the Phoenix framework getting started guide and ran into a warning when running: `mix phx.server`, which told me: cd assets && npm install
[19:07:00] <czard> I do that and I get a cryptic error: npm ERR! gyp verb `which` failed Error: not found: python2
[19:07:35] <czard> well it's not too cryptic, but it looks like I need python2 at this point? anyone knows what's up with that?
[19:08:28] <czard> really not used to npm, but i've got up to date npm and nodejs on my machine
[19:08:54] <rawtaz> mayhew: yes. and it doesnt require much brain power to understand the effects of reconnecting over and over again
[19:09:32] <rawtaz> czard: interesting, but at that point it's entirely an npm question/issue :o i dont know why it requires python2, but apparnetly it does
[19:09:48] <rawtaz> czard: you can apply some verbose flag i think to see in more detail what it fails on
[19:09:56] <rawtaz> npm --help or something like that
[19:10:02] <mayhew> rawtaz: my point is that sometimes you're not even thinking about those effects if your IRC starts up silently in the background.
[19:10:08] <rawtaz> mayhew: yep
[19:10:11] <czard> rawtaz: yeah looks like it, thanks will look into that 
[19:10:27] <rawtaz> mayhew: and THAT makes you a really bad person for not paying moer attention in your life to irc? :)
[19:10:33] <rawtaz> s/?/!/
[19:12:59] <mayhew> haha, I guess! This is one of the reasons I don't auto connect anymore, but it's an easy "mistake" to make.

[19:20:35] <czard> looks like npm install really wants to build node-gyp, instead of pulling binary 
[19:21:21] <czard> it actually wants to build the version v3.8.0 of node-gyp when latest release is v8.1.0
[19:21:38] <czard> which requires python2
[19:21:41] <czard> my mind is a bit blown
[19:23:09] <czard> I think this comes from a dev dependency in the mix phx.new assets/package.json on: node-sass: "node-sass": "^4.13.1
[19:25:11] <czard> when latest release of node-sass is 6.0.1
[19:25:59] <czard> I just updated that version in assets/package.json and I managed to run a successfull: npm install

[21:13:21] <czard> my solution caused an error when running: mix phx.server so that wasn't good 
[21:13:35] <czard> Nicd: thanks! will try that
[21:13:57] <czard> raised an issue on phoenix: https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/4359
[21:16:38] <czard> Nicd: this worked brilliantly 
[21:16:44] <Nicd> existing issue: https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/4308
[21:16:53] <czard> Pinned it with version: 1.35.1 in package.json 
[21:17:16] <czard> npm install && node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --mode development worked fine
[21:17:56] <czard> mix phx.server doesn't raise warning or error and I can navigate localhost:4000 fine
