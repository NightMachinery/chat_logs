[10:08:47] <nimaje> why is the startup time to long? you know that you can give it as many urls as you want?
[10:11:10] <nimaje> not directly, but one could probably write a service; did yt-dlp also make the python interface better? with the original yt-dl it wasn't that nice to use directly from python
