[12:42:21] <MaxLeiter> Snuupy: https://donate.mozilla.org 
[12:42:24] <MaxLeiter> :D
[12:42:39] <Snuupy> sorry, not in a position to donate rn
[12:42:52] <Snuupy> I used to work at Brave and my manager was like, why aren't you dogfooding our browser?!
[12:42:59] <xnaas> also money doesn't go to firefox anyway
[12:42:59] <Snuupy> I'm like lol half the websites were breaking at one point
[12:43:08] <xnaas> goes to the CEO and Pocket and other garbage
[12:43:09] <xnaas> :P
[12:43:22] <MaxLeiter> fair enough, just pointing out you can't really expect feature parity 
[12:43:36] <Snuupy> pocket is such a pos
[12:43:53] <MaxLeiter> not a fan of pocket but i do like monitor and some of their other work 
[12:44:02] <xnaas> on the flip, every time I use Chromium-based anything (except maybe Vivaldi) I'm like "fuck why can't I do anything and everything is missing and awful"
[12:44:21] <MaxLeiter> i used vivaldi when it came out for the splitscreen feature 
[12:44:29] <MaxLeiter> then i moved to an OS with proper window managers
[12:44:45] <xnaas> I like the chrome (as in gui/skin), but not the Chromium...
[12:44:55] <xnaas> Vivaldi over Gecko would be god tier Q_Q
