That meant "de-catholisizing" the Dirndl. Meaning that

[10:27:40] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder whether the problem really is that the reliability of a computer is bottlenecked by the least reliable component
[10:28:24] <PapuaHardyNet> afaik CPUs are the most reliable components. I'm unsure what the least reliable components are. Surely they aren't graphics cards, what with them being used for years in crypto mining "farms".
[10:29:05] <PapuaHardyNet> Yes, different manufacturers and different products have different reliability measures, but I'm talking in a more "median reliability" sense
[10:31:10] <Obormot\Gaia> The least reliable components are motherboards
[10:31:20] <Obormot\Gaia> It's kind of cheating to give that answer, of course
[10:31:28] <Obormot\Gaia> Because a motherboard is a whole bunch of crap
[10:31:38] <Obormot\Gaia> But it's also true, for exactly that reason
[10:31:58] <spxtr> I've had video cards and cpus break, but never a motherboard. Sample size 3
[10:32:23] <Obormot\Gaia> Your southbridge controller can fail, your northbridge controller can fail, any one of your multiple storage controllers can fail
[10:32:25] <Obormot\Gaia> etc., etc.
[10:33:21] <Obormot\Gaia> spxtr: My sample size is much, much higher than that, because I worked sales/service in a computer shop for a few years
[10:33:55] <spxtr> ah, when I worked for computer service, basically the only cause of failure I saw was water damage
[10:34:00] <spxtr> to be fair, that's usually to the motherboard
[10:34:11] <Obormot\Gaia> Heh
[10:34:16] <Obormot\Gaia> That's true!

[11:00:59] <spxtr> charlie lieber?
[11:01:48] <spxtr> yes, charlie lieber.
[11:01:51] <capisce> PapuaHardyNet: https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/21/politics/charles-lieber-harvard-china-ties-guilty/index.html
[11:01:56] <Robomot> Charles Lieber: Harvard professor found guilty of lying about Chinese government ties - CNNPolitics (A Harvard University professor was convicted by a federal jury on Tuesday of lying to the US about his involvement with China's government, the Justice Department announced.)
[11:02:42] <PapuaHardyNet> lying to the IRS is the worst crime an American can ever commit, I take it
[11:02:43] <capisce> don't have to be smart to be a professor
[11:02:59] <spxtr> it's just kinda sad all around. he really was one of the greatest chemists of all time
[11:03:08] <spxtr> and he's dying of cancer or something
[11:03:58] <spxtr> and the amount he was paid was not even that much
[11:04:23] <capisce> "Charles M. Lieber is an American chemist, pioneer in nanoscience and nanotechnology, and a convicted felon. In 2011, Lieber was named the leading chemist in the world for the decade 2000‚Äì2010 by Thomson Reuters, based on the impact of his scientific publications."
[11:05:24] <Gurkenglas> "making false statements to federal authorities" i thought you needed something more specific for that to be illegal
[11:07:36] <capisce> "In December 2021, Lieber was convicted of six felonies, including two counts of making false statements to the FBI and investigators from the Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health regarding his participation in the Chinese government's Thousand Talents Program, as well as four counts of filing false tax returns"
[11:08:48] <capisce> Since 2007 Lieber has grown giant pumpkins in his front and back yards in Lexington, Massachusetts."In 2010 he won the annual weigh-off at Frerich's Farm in Rhode Island with a 1,610-lb pumpkin, and returned in 2012 with a 1,770-lb pumpkin that won 2nd place in that year's weigh-off but set a Massachusetts record. His 1,870-lb pumpkin in 2014 was named the largest pumpkin in Massachusetts and ranked 
[11:08:54] <capisce> 17th largest in the world that year. In 2020, the year of his arrest, he grew a 2,276-lb pumpkin that currently holds the record for the largest ever grown in Massachusetts."
[11:09:17] <ggreer> what the hell? did the IRS want 35% of his pumpkin or something?
[11:10:06] <capisce> an upstanding citizen and all-around nice guy, shame about the tax evasion and lying to the feds
[11:10:36] <spxtr> basically offered a nice salary + funding to start a lab in china, but his other funding source disallows it.
[11:10:39] <capisce> also it turns out he was running an underground meth lab
[11:10:43] <spxtr> So, he did it on the dl
[11:10:54] <PapuaHardyNet> meth lab? really? so cliche
[11:11:09] <capisce> purest methamphetamine you've ever seen
[11:12:22] <PapuaHardyNet> but on a more serious note, makes sense that they didn't want him to start a lab in china
[11:12:23] <ggreer> sounds like a pretty cool guy
[11:12:44] <spxtr> yeah, he is.
[11:13:25] <PlanckWalk> The "false statements" appear to be in relation to federal grants
[11:13:39] <PlanckWalk> (But I'm still reading the trial brief)
[11:13:52] <spxtr> yeah when you apply for DoE grants and the like you have to state other funding sources, and they won't let you get the grant if you say you're getting china money
[11:14:03] <spxtr> so he's forced to choose one or the other
[11:14:09] <spxtr> he chose to lie and get both
[11:16:06] <PapuaHardyNet> when you have two gfs, USA and China, but they dislike each other
[11:16:38] <PapuaHardyNet> China is okay with being a side piece as long as you actually invest your efforts and care about her
[11:16:59] <PapuaHardyNet> USA is a control freak who will take revenge for any slight and perceived betrayal

[11:21:44] <capisce> "in November 2018, the NIH inquired of Harvard University about Lieber's foreign affiliations. In January 2019, Harvard interviewed Lieber and reported to NIH that Lieber "had no formal association with WUT" after 2012."
[11:22:09] <capisce> "beginning in 2011, Lieber became a "Strategic Scientist" at Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in China. He later became a contractual participant in China's Thousand Talents Plan from at least 2012 through 2015"
[11:22:15] <capisce> is it just a question of time frame?
[11:23:11] <capisce> "In a taped interview, Lieber admitted travelling from Wuhan to Boston with bags of cash containing between $50,000 and $100,000, which he said he never disclosed to the IRS."
[11:23:25] <capisce> During the investigation Lieber told authorities that he did not do it for the money and described himself as "younger and stupid". He also told federal agents: "Every scientist wants a Nobel Prize."
[11:23:51] <capisce> who hasn't done some stupid things in their 50s
[11:24:42] <PapuaHardyNet> wait, how do you get a nobel prize by travelling with bags of cash
[11:25:38] *** Quits: adiabatic (~adiabatic@user/adiabatic) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[11:25:51] <spxtr> the main thing the chinese gave him was hella money to start a lab in wuhan
[11:25:58] <spxtr> he wanted to use that to get a nobel prize
[11:26:21] <spxtr> and he probably would've won it, depending on how fast he died from cancer
[11:26:32] <PapuaHardyNet> really? whoa
[11:26:57] <spxtr> (I personally hope he wins it despite the conviction. The swedes could really stick it to the us govt)
[11:28:55] <PapuaHardyNet> "Researchers predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next ten years, such as translating languages (by 2024), writing high-school essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and working as a surgeon (by 2053).
[11:29:00] <spxtr> he's also one of those rare scientists that should win the prize in both chemistry and physics
[11:29:04] <PapuaHardyNet> Researchers believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years, with Asian respondents expecting these dates much sooner than North Americans."

[11:29:42] <capisce> just after my retirement age, unfair
[11:29:47] <PapuaHardyNet> not saying these predictions are correct! however, this was the most discussed article in 2017, meaning this is probably the more detailed predictions that the broader AI community may have in mind
[11:33:49] <PlanckWalk> Interesting that the timelines for "outperforming humans in all tasks" are shorter than "automating all human jobs"
[11:35:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> If I want to do a unidirectional sync (i.e., incremental backup) from a remote server
[11:35:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> rsync?
[11:35:27] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or is there some better tool?
[11:35:57] <PapuaHardyNet> rsync is great. Do you want deduplicated backups?
[11:36:08] <PapuaHardyNet> also do you want incremental but multiple backups?
[11:36:29] <PapuaHardyNet> if yes to both, then borgbackup is worth looking at
[11:38:16] <Obormot\Gaia> Do I want deduplicated backups... uh, do I?
[11:38:28] <Obormot\Gaia> Also what do you mean by multiple
[11:39:16] <PapuaHardyNet> Obormot: you can have multiple snapshots of backups, like git commits, that you can check out
[11:39:35] <Obormot\Gaia> nnno, I have Time Machine for that
[11:40:26] <PapuaHardyNet> hmm. use rsync then. the deduping is probably a part of Time Machine already so no point in adding another complex tool to your infra

[12:28:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hm
[12:28:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can rsync do bidirectional sync?
[12:29:56] <saturn2> it can ignore files that are newer on the destination side, if you do that both ways it's kind of like bidirectional sync
[12:30:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> What do you mean by "do that both ways"
[12:30:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, two rsync operations, one in each direction, and in each case ignore newer files on destination?
[12:30:58] <saturn2> yes
[12:31:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> hm
[12:32:48] <saturn2> i would recommend syncthing instead though
[12:46:44] <nshepperd2> hmm apparently lactobacillus can survive at up to 65¬∞C? maybe it actually does have something to do with the surface of my sous vide steak going green
[12:47:30] <nshepperd2> dipping it in boiling water before sealing didn't seem to help though
[12:47:45] <nshepperd2> but maybe it was just insufficient
[12:49:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> syncthing eh
[12:56:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Syncthing seems to just not work on this box
[12:56:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> Fails to start
[12:57:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway I don't know if I can even install syncthing on my NFSN account
[12:57:14] <Gurkenglas> Can you recommend an Alexa/Siri-like that runs on my computer so I know when it uses microphone/camera/files/internet/etc?
[12:58:04] <Gurkenglas> nlsh is pretty close by itself but one could dress it up a little.
[12:59:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Speakable Items imo >_>
[13:05:03] <Gurkenglas> Why ">_>"? Because it's the kind of AI you would want killed with fire if it were more advanced? It is a Mac thing... are Mac VMs good?
[13:32:51] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't get it: the mac application will not be able to access anything outside the VM, so you won't have any use of it "detecting" any application using microphone, camera, files, or the internet
[13:36:38] <nshepperd2> Gurkenglas wants the convenience of alexa but without it being a portal to hell
[13:36:49] <Gurkenglas> You can do quite a lot of things using just microphone, camera, files and internet. Running it on the computer was, for the first step, just supposed to have the abilities of an Amazon Echo without - yes, that.
[13:37:35] <Gurkenglas> you pressed enter while i was figuring out how to word the last part.
[13:38:28] <Gurkenglas> (thanks to whoever made "to word" mean that, a small step towards language being neat.)
[13:44:09] <PapuaHardyNet> Oh, I see, he wants something like (windows (mac-vm (alexa-driver) (speakable-items)))
[13:46:25] <Gurkenglas> Interfacing with all of my computer sure sounds better! Maybe all it takes is any speech-to-text and a fleshed out nlsh variant.
[13:59:15] <saturn2> >_> because you can't mention speakable items without calling to mind the terrifying possibility of unspeakable items

[15:29:54] <PapuaHardyNet> thanks a lot, I didn't realize that one could do that
[15:31:18] <PapuaHardyNet> but yes, looks like AI researchers focus only on 55 to 57 Atari video games, and these are only 2600 video games. since there are games for the Atari 5200 that aren't in 2600, I can safely say that we haven't hit the ...
[15:31:27] <PapuaHardyNet> ... point where AI is better than humans at all atari games
[15:31:40] <PapuaHardyNet> example of a 5200 only video game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenji_(video_game)
[15:31:40] <Robomot> Zenji (video game) - Wikipedia (Zenji is a puzzle game designed by Matthew Hubbard and published by Activision in 1984.[1] It was released for the Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit family, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, MSX, and ZX Spectrum. Hubbard previously wrote Dolphin for the Atari 2600.[1])
[15:32:02] <Gurkenglas> Do you have a reason to think that the same architecture wouldn't work on 5200 games?
[15:33:42] <PapuaHardyNet> No, if the architecture is scalable, then due to the scaling hypothesis, it is probably possible for us to achieve this breakthrough this year itself
[15:34:14] <Gurkenglas> Do you have a reason to think that scaling is required?
[15:34:25] <PapuaHardyNet> however, I won't consider it achieved unless someone has actually done it
[15:35:26] <PapuaHardyNet> sure, scaling is necessary. scaling has consistently provided exponential qualitative and quantitative improvements in performance of models given an increase in data, compute, and the size of neural networks
[15:36:05] <PapuaHardyNet> this exponential improvment is why scaling will outcompete any other approach to solving the problem
[15:36:31] <Gurkenglas> I mean, might the same network work on the 5200-games without further scaling if one had trained it on them instead of the 2600-games?
[15:36:48] <PapuaHardyNet> and by scalable I mean any architecture where you can literally stack layers for better performance (self-attention, convolution)
[15:37:34] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, that is also possible, you may not even need further scaling
[15:38:08] <PapuaHardyNet> are you saying that the authors of the agent57 research paper have simply said "proving that this can be used to solve all atari games is left up to the reader"?
[15:38:37] <Gurkenglas> plausible to me.
[15:39:59] <PapuaHardyNet> hahahah, I agree. but it still won't count until someone has actually done it, in my opinion
[15:45:41] <PapuaHardyNet> fun fact, this is probably the earliest paper that posits what we now call the "scaling hypothesis": https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232511/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1975/Raw.Power.html

[19:25:40] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd: I've noticed you have a very "positive" acceptance when it comes to accepting the whims of supply and demand when it comes to determining prices. I really like that and want to emulate it
[19:27:54] <PapuaHardyNet> the underlying psychological mechanism probably is this: you do not consider extreme prices unfair. you believe that regulation isn't useful or wrong for prices of certain / most goods, including utilities (see your comment about electricity used in mosques, for example)
[19:29:15] <PapuaHardyNet> do you have some sort of mental dichotomy where you separate certain goods as "Veblen goods" and believe that it the market should decide for it entirely, while other goods you consider as "essential goods" or "staple goods" where you believe that regulating the prices is necessary?
[19:29:52] <PapuaHardyNet> One way I can and will adapt to your method of thinking is by considering more and more goods as Veblen goods. I, however, am curious where you draw the line.

[21:37:40] <kuudes> 7 minutes in, 45.4% of votes counted
[21:37:42] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, bizarre selection of relationships was a red flag. I'm not well versed with stats enough to have seen the other flags though
[21:37:55] <nshepperd> PapuaHardyNet: the opposite, if anything, i think market determination of prices for essential goods is more important than usual, bc shortages are unacceptable
[21:38:40] <nshepperd> with veblen goods it is fine to regulate prices bc a shortage of them would not be harmful
[21:40:10] <nshepperd> if the government sets a price on bread that is unrealistic, bread does not get made and you have a big problem
[21:40:42] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd: that's a very, very surprising thing you've said imo. surprising because to me, extremely high prices for veblen goods doesn't really matter, while regulating prices on staples ensures that everyone can afford the staples ...
[21:40:52] <PapuaHardyNet> especially because the government will intervene if there are shortages
[21:41:20] <nshepperd> regulating prices on staples does not accomplish that
[21:42:16] <PapuaHardyNet> I don't get it: the government absorbs the high prices, ensuring there's no actual shortage of a staple good
[21:42:53] <nshepperd> are you talking about price controls or subsidies
[21:42:55] <PapuaHardyNet> perhaps you are implying that government absorbing high prices, and regulating prices, are two separate things and not always intertwined as I think it is
[21:43:03] <aweinstock> you're assuming the price ceiling is implemented as a subsidy?
[21:43:49] <aweinstock> (as opposed to just fining/jailing people for selling above the ceiling)
[21:43:57] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah, something like that. if bread costs 1$ more than the maximum amount set by a government, the government buys bread and then sells it for 1$ less
[21:44:58] <PapuaHardyNet> oh yeah, fining and jailing is a part of it - their only customer who'll buy above market rates would be the government
[21:45:36] <aweinstock> (e.g. https://www.news10.com/news/troy-pizza-restaurant-owner-admits-to-price-gouging-facemasks/)
[21:45:42] <Robomot> Troy pizza restaurant owner admits to price gouging facemasks (A 35-year-old Troy pizza restaurant owner has pled guilty to hoarding and price gouging face masks during the coronavirus pandemic. Imran Selcuk purchased around 100,000 KN95 facemasks and 25,000 surgical-style facemasks in March 2020, which he then placed for sale at up to 500% of the purchase price.)
[21:46:17] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, I am in the understanding that in the practical cases indeed it is just the police uses violence on shopkeepers who sell for too high prices
[21:46:30] <kuudes> not that the government would do the complex thing to buy all things and resell them
[21:46:31] <nshepperd> subsidies on goods, tend to be inefficient and promote waste of whatever is subsidized
[21:47:37] <nshepperd> The same policy objective could generally be accomplished instead by giving a cash transfer to whoever is allegedly unable to afford the staple
[21:48:23] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd: that's actually sensible
[21:48:39] <nshepperd> this cash transfer being fixed instead of proportional to how much of the essential good you destroy
[21:49:16] <nshepperd> my favourite example of this is water
[21:49:31] <nshepperd> agriculture almost everywhere gets subsidized water
[21:50:17] <nshepperd> The result is overdrawing and people doing crazy things like growing almonds in desert biomes
[21:50:49] <PapuaHardyNet> I agree with you: subsidies are more wasteful compared to cash transfers
[21:51:17] <nshepperd> The subsidy is justified by appealing to "but think of the farmers"

[22:23:56] <Robomot> Ben Golub (@ben_golub): "Hidden curriculum observation: audiences are eager to classify "new" ideas as essentially understood or unimportant to conserve their scarce attention. Can seem unfair/ungenerous, and in a way it is! But anyway hit them on the head with why it's new and important."

[22:37:36] <Robomot> Sales Impact of Advertising cartoon | Marketoonist | Tom Fishburne (Lately I've been re-reading David Ogilvy's 1983 classic, "Ogilvy on Advertising" to see how much has changed ‚Äî and how much has remained the same ‚Äî in advertising over the years. One constant is the challenge of how to measure sales impact in advertising, and the tension of long-term brand building versus short-term direct response.)
