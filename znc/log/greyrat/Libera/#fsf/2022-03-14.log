[00:24:58] <seabass_> Although, I suspect if there is a GitHub repository it's probably more up-to-date than Mozilla's library!

[00:53:19] <qrpnxz> i shouldn't even need to ask; there should be clear directions for source code access on the page. Even a link to a github repo isn't really appropriate, since while technically the corresponding source may be therein, i have no way of knowing which commit is the corresponding source of the extension i downloaded.

[05:52:19] <Andrew> (It's China)
[05:52:50] <damo22> ugh i dont even know any of those
[05:53:18] <anton> they're all proprietary
[05:53:31] <damo22> you could run a QubesOS system and run them in a disposable VM
[05:54:08] <damo22> it could get pretty annoying with uploading pdfs though
[05:54:18] <damo22> or your work
[06:04:24] <DiffieHellman> Even if you jail it, it's still proprietary.
[06:04:37] <anton> ^
[06:06:10] <damo22> yeah it's less than ideal, but if you have other things on your system that you want to keep safe, VMs are good
[06:07:01] <DiffieHellman> Ehh, I wouldn't trust something as compilicated as a hypervisor at all.
[06:07:37] <damo22> ok, but theyre cheaper than buying a second laptop
[06:09:12] <damo22> not everyone can afford to partition off their required proprietary software by having a dedicated machine to run it on
[06:10:07] <qrpnxz> i use slack for work, but it's on the work computer, which i don't own and generally have little control over free software or not.
[06:10:47] <qrpnxz> i do no personal computing there, only work-for-hire
[06:12:14] <damo22> accessing pci devices over iommu offers genuine isolation, its at least half decent
[06:14:19] <damo22> hurd should use iommu to access pci
[06:14:39] <DiffieHellman> Isn't IOMMU for PCIe?
[06:14:51] <damo22> pci/pcie
[06:16:17] <DiffieHellman> PCI has DMA huh? Generally only older computers have PCI and I believe most older computers don't have IOMMU.

[14:19:44] <DiffieHellman> Whatsapp has encryption and it's okay aside from the backdoor.

[18:26:17] <isf> just remmember recommend free distros. https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html 
[18:26:41] <isf> for example vatt, i sell the work of installation for near to 40 USD 
[18:26:56] <vatt> okay.. i would like to install a free distro for someone, but am not sure what price to ask. i do not want to ask too much of course
[18:26:59] <anton> I don't know if contact@<domain>.edu is valid, and they don't really list a general contact address. They have a contact form that requires nonfree software (recaptcha) instead.
[18:27:02] <isf> but you can sell it for 150USD if you want, that isnt important, you have freedom to sell it for the price you want.
[18:27:15] <vatt> okay.
[18:27:23] <vatt> thank you!
[18:27:34] <isf> i recomend you sell that service for 1k of USD vatt
[18:28:07] <isf> but maybe, in the market they dont go to accept it, so maybe you need put other price for computing for a better price and a better service. ¡Happy hacking!
[18:28:29] <vatt> okay. happy hacking 2 isf 🙃

[19:43:33] <nckx> Yes?
[19:43:54] <fossdev2> For works of software it is not recommended, as CC0 has a term expressly stating it does not grant you any patent licenses.
[19:44:27] <fossdev2> i don't understand this statement
[19:45:56] <Andrew> what are you confused about
[19:46:30] <fossdev2> what if i don't want patent
[19:47:34] <nckx> Most people agree that the Expat (MIT) licence grants you an implicit patent licence.  If I write a piece of code that uses a patented technique, then give it to you under Expat terms, you can (very likely) freely use it.  If I release it as public domain/CC0, you cannot, because I just said ‘here it is, I waive my copyrights’ not ‘you may explicitly use this as you see fit’.
[19:48:27] <nckx> Patents rights are separate from copyrights.

[19:56:33] <nckx> There just isn't a good reason to use CC0/public domain for code.  If you're hell bent on using (and seems so :) you *can*, but that doesn't make it a *good idea*.  The extremely minimal text of Expat/BSD-style licences are there for a reason, such as ‘don't remove this licence text’.
[19:56:37] <yrk> similarly, you could buy the copyrights and trademarks to a previously free piece of culture and start harassing people using it
[19:57:07] <yrk> all of these extremely short licenses are short for a reason: they don't actually do anything

[20:03:27] <nckx> It's better for code than both.
