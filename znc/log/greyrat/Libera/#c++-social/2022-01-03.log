[00:22:38] <dukwon> in france/germany, if the holiday falls on a weekend, you get it added to your "free choice" days
[00:22:47] <Renderwww> what?
[00:22:50] <dukwon> in the UK, if it falls on a weekend then it's observed on the following monday
[00:23:29] <Renderwww> that must be a special rule with your employer because that is not the norm
[00:23:35] <dukwon> ?
[00:23:57] <dukwon> i get 30 days off a year
[00:24:01] <jotham> we have the same in nz
[00:24:06] <jotham> it's called mondayization

[00:24:11] <dukwon> i am forced to spend them on national holidays if they fall on a weekday
[00:24:20] <dukwon> but if they fall on a weekend, i don't lose the day off

[00:26:49] <dukwon> 11
[00:27:17] <Renderwww> kek, so wurst case you only have 19 "proper" days off?

[00:27:26] <Faux> I mean, that's quite a lot.
[00:27:34] <Faux> I think it's 20 including public holidays.
[00:27:49] <dukwon> it may be mathematically impossible for all of them to fall on a weekday

[20:24:45] <Renderwww> one day of work done, only ~30 more years to go
[20:29:53] <Faux> \o/
[20:31:42] <dukwon> Faux, do you have a S&S ISA or vanguard account or similar?
[20:31:51] <Faux> Yes, iweb.
[20:32:15] <Faux> i-weeb, after all.

[20:32:57] <dukwon> i feel like i should be doing something with my savings
[20:33:48] <T`alZHeimeR> BLOCKCHAIN
[20:34:02] <dukwon> i can excuse my current lump being eroded by inflation and student loans as being an "emergency fund"
[20:34:20] <Faux> Yeah, especially if you're paying tax. Extra pension contributions to your employer? SIPP? Then S&S. Vanguard's LS80, which you can buy on not-vanguard if your pot size is significant.
[20:34:40] <dukwon> i won't be paying tax on my CERN salary
[20:35:00] <dukwon> and i won't be working there long enough to get the pension: i have to either bank it out or transfer it to a private pension at the end
[20:36:24] <dukwon> about half my savings were also tax free (from my PhD stipend), but everything in the last 4 years has been "inefficient"
[20:37:10] <dukwon> i made some compulsory supplementary (??) pension payments in france but i have no idea what i can do with that
[20:37:17] <dukwon> and i assume the same in germany
[20:37:38] <dukwon> although i think with germany i may "get nothing" without 5 years of payments?
[20:39:50] <dukwon> i translated my french payslip once, and it has "pension", "supplementary pension" and "complementary pension"
[20:41:27] <Renderwww> you might be able to get back what you paid into the german pension system if you don't qualify to get one in the end
[20:41:45] <dukwon> "in the end" = when i emmigrate or when i retire?
[20:42:04] <Renderwww> no clue, you'll have to rtfm
[20:42:07] <dukwon> ok
[20:43:10] <dukwon> i'll most likely be moving to france (although i believe i can still get a swiss private pension as a frontalière/IGO employee) so i may try to transfer my german balance into my existing french one?

[20:46:36] <Renderwww> https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Broschueren/national/beitragserstattung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4  I bet it's only available in german
[20:46:55] <dukwon> thanks
[20:47:28] <T`alZHeimeR> even their urls are insanely long
[20:48:25] <Renderwww> it says you have to wait two years before you get anything
[20:48:39] <dukwon> 2 years after emmigrating?
[20:49:23] <dukwon> i might be working in some third place by then (unlikely)
[20:50:36] <Renderwww> not sure if I understand it correctly but it sounds 2 years after you paid the last time into the pension
[20:50:48] <dukwon> ok
[20:50:55] <dukwon> which page is this?
[20:51:10] <Renderwww> 9
[20:51:12] <Renderwww> NEIN!
[20:51:41] <T`alZHeimeR> typical german humor
[20:51:55] <dukwon> "erstatten" is refund?
[20:51:58] <T`alZHeimeR> i bet dukwon is ROFLing right now
[20:53:46] <Renderwww> yes
[20:53:57] <dukwon> can i merge it into my french one?
[20:54:16] <Renderwww> german humor https://imgur.com/a/Y5MYve7
[20:54:36] <Renderwww> they probably try to make it annoying as possible so nobody files for a refund
[20:55:53] <Renderwww> I suspect they just wire you some money, not clue if that is transferable to another pension
[20:56:27] <dukwon> a refund sounds like it will have income tax deducted from it
[20:56:29] <jotham> is that literally
[20:56:36] <jotham> you get a refund if it wasn't funny
[20:57:06] *** jotham is now known as BIRDSORTING
[20:57:25] <Renderwww> also they only payout the part on the payslip that is makred as your contribution if I understand it correctly. So the "Arbeitgeberanteil" is lost like tears in rain
[20:57:39] <dukwon> but ok, 2 years of income tax on supplementary pension payments is probably negligible
[20:57:54] <dukwon> damn
[20:58:09] <dukwon> i should check how much the employer contribution is
[20:58:35] <dukwon> although my current understanding (given i only take home 60% of my gross salary) is that there are no employer contributions
[21:00:42] <Renderwww> it's half/half afaik, but that employer part isn't listed in your pre-tax income.
[21:00:47] <dukwon> ok
[21:01:34] <dukwon> so if i get a refund, i get slightly less than half of the balance back? (tax deducted and employer contributions vanish)
[21:01:47] <dukwon> sounds like something i don't want to do
[21:02:55] <dukwon> https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/retire-abroad/supplementary-pensions-abroad/index_en.htm
[21:03:08] <dukwon> this page says i shouldn't incur a penalty from moving around within the EU
[21:03:19] <Renderwww> not sure if there is anything tax related that vanishes, tax is afaik calculated before pensions are deducted
[21:04:27] <BIRDSORTING> man not paying tax was a shit idea aye
[21:04:33] <Renderwww> the government pension probably isn't "supplementary"
[21:04:34] <BIRDSORTING> 3 years of financial home detention
[21:04:36] <BIRDSORTING> is no joke
[21:04:43] <BIRDSORTING> i have like 80 days to go
[21:04:46] <BIRDSORTING> i am super excited
[21:04:51] <Renderwww> you should have timed your detention with covid
[21:04:55] <Renderwww> would have made no difference
[21:04:58] <BIRDSORTING> haha 
[21:05:05] <BIRDSORTING> well most of it was during covid
[21:05:07] <BIRDSORTING> so i kinda did
[21:05:26] <dukwon> Renderwww, indeed, i'm not talking about the €420/mo state pension but the €78/mo supplement i've been paying
[21:05:52] <dukwon> the state pension is just based on how many years you've contributed
[21:06:03] <dukwon> and that accumulates across EU member states
[21:06:08] <Renderwww> oh
[21:06:15] <dukwon> i won't worry about that unless i decide to move back to the UK
[21:06:31] <Renderwww> I was talking about the state pension the whole time
[21:10:02] <Renderwww> the supplementary ones are all a scam, even with the tax advantage they aren't much better than just buying some index ETF

[21:22:32] <Renderwww> did you mean NFT?
[21:22:41] <dukwon> yes
[21:23:04] <dukwon> EFT is effective field theory, my bad
[21:23:21] <dukwon> slightly less silly than monkey pictures
[21:30:49] <Renderwww> ha, after my latest update suspend doesn't work at all. It now crashes right when trying to suspend
[21:30:57] <Renderwww> before that it sometimes crashed on resume
