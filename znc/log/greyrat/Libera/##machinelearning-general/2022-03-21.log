[20:29:49] <lesshaste> dostoyevsky2, they are meant to the same. Are they different?

[20:32:19] <lesshaste> I think that's the same thing
[20:34:07] <dostoyevsky2> rsquared vs rmse is different for sure, though
[20:35:24] <lesshaste> dostoyevsky2, delete the rmse part and you get exactly the same output

[23:06:16] <Neeknaim> Hello
[23:06:27] <Neeknaim> A question about modeling: Lets say I have an X df , y and a X_test df (the X_test is the one that I need to use at the end to predict the results). I take the X df and split it to train and valid dfs. I check which model looks best (using X_train, X_valid and y)  and then fit a model with the same manipulation on the whole of X  (which used to be split to train and valid) and then use this model on X_test. Is that legitimate? Or
[23:06:29] <Neeknaim> should I have just stayed with the model from the train_test_split (train vs valid) and use that on X_test?
[23:07:52] *** Quits: bitkiller (~bitkiller@user/bitkiller) (Quit: bitkiller)
[23:12:29] <mefistofeles> Neeknaim: yeah, that's not correct as far as I understand. You cannot use train data to validate your model
[23:12:36] <mefistofeles> I mean, you can, but you shouldn't :)
[23:14:41] <Neeknaim> mefistofeles: sorry, could you explain what you mean by "use train data to validate your model"?
[23:16:04] <mefistofeles> Neeknaim: you should just split your data (train vs validation and/or test), and fit a model only with train data, and validate/test the model only with validation/test data
[23:16:49] <mefistofeles> mixing them up is not recommended unless you really know what you are doing
[23:16:55] <Neeknaim> sorry, I'm confused
[23:18:12] <mefistofeles> Neeknaim: no worries, what don't you understand?
[23:18:38] <Neeknaim> I'm talking about a kaggle exercise where they give me a df of houses data and their price (X=house data, y=prices of the houses in X). I get another set X_test which is only houses data. I need to predict the prices of the houses in X_test.
[23:20:30] <Neeknaim> The exercise usually takes X and y, split them to train df (80%) and validation df (20%). We then try to find a good model. Then at the end we usually take the best model and run it on X_test to predict the prices and submit the result.
[23:22:39] <mefistofeles> Neeknaim: yeah, that's right
[23:23:35] <Neeknaim> My question now is: After I found the best model (lets say I discovered that I had a low mean error when I used RandomForestRegressor with n=100 and used 20 of the 60 columns in X). I can now run this model to predict the prices in X_test. BUT can I also fit a new model (RandomForestRegressor with n=100 and the same 20 columns) but this time fit it on the whole of X (not just the 80% of it) and y, and then use the model I get to
[23:23:36] <Neeknaim> predict the prices in X_test?
[23:24:44] <mefistofeles> Neeknaim: no, because in the second case you would be using X_test as part of your training, wouldn't you?
[23:25:52] <Neeknaim> no
[23:26:36] <Neeknaim> There is X df that corresponds to y (an array of prices) and X_test which is a different df
[23:27:03] <mefistofeles> oh I see, so you would be using the X that includes the validation?
[23:28:18] <Neeknaim> I will be using the X that I used to split 80%:20% but instead of splitting it I will use all of it
[23:28:42] <mefistofeles> yeah, so you would be using validation data to train it
[23:28:46] <mefistofeles> how would then you validate?
[23:29:29] <Neeknaim> Yes, I will be using the data I have in y which I used to split to training data and validation data
[23:35:38] <Neeknaim> So is it valid to do such a thing?
