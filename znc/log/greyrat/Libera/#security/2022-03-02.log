[01:10:16] <moose> US v. Nosal set a precedent to define what "exceeding access" meant and concluded it was only for the specific context of a person granted access who then committed a crime by escalating their access without authorization - but if they were granted access or if no protection mechanism existed, it's not covered by the CFAA unless it was used to enhance a crime
[01:11:00] <moose> So basically lack of sufficient protection mechanisms or compensating controls = unprotected system = public access as long as it's not used to enhance a crime

[01:13:49] <moose> The issue with using the first one solely as the underlying reasoning is that it was for an employee who used the systems for an improper purpose.
[01:14:05] <moose> So it doesn't necessarily cover a random person who was never granted ANY prior access, but it's a good footing.

[01:17:03] <moose> Yep, that looks correct.

[01:18:36] <ash_worksi> TimMc: Thanks I'll try looking those up
[01:18:56] <moose> It is worth noting that the people in these cases may have lost, but there are important clarifying rulings in there that set precedent for future cases
[01:20:14] <moose> https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R46536.pdf this is also a good read for anyone who has no clue what the CFAA is or the intent of it
[01:20:30] <TimMc> moose: Yeah, "you broke the law, but you didn't break it in this specific way" is always fun.
[01:20:37] <moose> TimMc: yeah it's dicey
[01:20:54] <moose> I would not want to be the one in a court hearing where important shit is getting decided
[01:21:02] <moose> You will get shafted no matter what
[01:22:15] <TimMc> Sure. Even a completely innocent defendant who is fully exonerated is gonna be dragged through some shit.
[01:22:25] <moose> Yep, they'll forever be in debt most likely
[01:22:38] <TimMc> Well, that depends.
[01:22:38] <moose> You can survive a case without jail time but your life is robbed from you, no prosperity in your future, no financial independence, etc
[01:22:58] <moose> Yeah it depends but generally speaking the US government is immune to damages for wrongfully bringing a case against a person where sufficient foundation exists
[01:23:18] <moose> So there's no "we'll counter-sue for the monies" or "if we win, the attorney gets fees paid"

[01:23:51] <moose> Meanwhile the defendant has taken out a second mortgage to keep them at the minimum of the retainer for the case or sold all of their stocks/bonds/assets to do that.
[01:24:08] <TimMc> Civil suits, though... sometimes there's a way to come out on top.
[01:24:15] <moose> Yes but this is entirely criminal stuff :)
[01:24:27] <moose> In civil lawsuits, yes, there are ways to recover and come out on top of a wrongful lawsuit.
[01:24:54] <moose> But until the end, unless your attorney agrees to not get paid til the end, you're stuck with having to fork it over until it's decided and then there's no guarantees.
[01:25:22] <TimMc> Anti-SLAPP laws really do help, though.

[21:59:16] <piou> On one hand trying to ascertain the scale from videos is prone to failure on many respects: these videos tend to be viral, and someone documenting one act will prompt others documenting acts they think is similar, but you never have any context in these videos. In other word: drama brings drama. It's best not to try to act differently based on perceived scale if all you have is tiktok and
[21:59:22] <piou> twitter. On the other hand, note that publicizing and talking about these acts can embolden those that practice them, giving them a feeling of "them against the world" all while showing others doing the same things they do and justifiying it. So there again, you want enough mediatization and critics to get the government to discourage it, but not so much that you bring these people as "martyrs".

[22:58:14] <ajak> i would say it sounds like modern monetary theory (mmt) and piou has told me that's not quite right before but that's some words to get started in saerching

[22:58:29] <piou> it's not mmt
[22:58:40] <ajak> i know :)
[22:58:48] <piou> In the meantime it should be noted that no economist (not even Milton Friedman) ever said that inflation is systematicaly created by monetary creation
[22:59:49] <piou> What Friedman said is that too much money creation too fast creates inflation, which is a bit different
[23:00:32] <piou> even the traditional school of thought considers inflation a necessity to 1) boost economic growth and 2) avoid its evil cousin: deflation
[23:00:48] <piou> so the nuance is more on "what does too much too fast means" than anything
[23:01:01] <piou> still, will be good when I find the two reports I'm looking for

[23:02:50] <piou> Every economist I've ever read thinks the contrary. You can keep an economy running with inflation (we've been doing it for decades). But with deflation the most logical move is to stop buying anything and wait for prices to continue dropping (that's what deflation means). And that kills the economy as it stops all exchanges.
[23:03:37] <piou> Now to be fair, I've not studied real cases of deflation (although I think there were some) so I don't know how impactful it is in practice and how much of this is theory, but it does sound much darker than inflation
[23:03:55] <piou> Prices rising helping drive growth is logical
[23:03:58] <yhirose3> Well you can keep an economy running with very low levels of inflation - even 5% is too much. but you got to take someone into consideration when assessing if it's good or bad

[23:05:07] <piou> the money spent by some is gained by others, that's the cycle of the economy
[23:05:19] <piou> if people stop exchanges that's an economic crisis
[23:05:22] <yhirose3> piou: how so? deflation is measured as an average, so it's quite possible prices have gone down and your salary has remained the same

[23:06:01] <piou> that's another issue yes, what you call deflation and inflation exactly. Since it's an evolution of an average price you can have localize inflation and localized deflation
[23:06:29] <piou> but talking about localized events is difficult and outside the realm of what can be realistically discussed usefully on irc
[23:06:38] <piou> if you have global deflation now...
[23:08:03] <piou> In the meantime, https://www.bundesbank.de/en/tasks/topics/how-money-is-created-667392 is important. It's not at all the reports I'm looking for, but it shows great evolution in the way the Bundesbank (one of the two most influential banks in the EU with the bank of england (oh, yes, brexit)) drastically changed its views on monetary creation
[23:08:04] <websec> ^ How money is created | Deutsche Bundesbank
[23:09:13] <piou> They used to think that the central bank created money, and they maintained it to have the role of controling inflation through monetary creation. It turns out that they were wrong: the vast majority of money is created by loans made by regular banks to regular customers, such as the one you may have made to buy a house.
[23:09:41] <piou> This was a discovery, not a design, in fact it took great effort to convince them that this was the case (one of the two reports I'm looking for).
[23:10:17] *** Quits: uwu (~nya@user/phrost) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:10:34] <piou> This means several things, in particular the fact that we create *much* more money than we ever thought, and yet the inflation isn't even as high as the BCE (european central bank) would like
[23:10:38] *** Joins: uwu (~nya@user/phrost)
[23:11:27] <piou> This understanding was instrumental in realizing that the relationship between monetary creation (in the modern setting, with fiat money, not gold) and inflation is much more complex than previously thought
[23:12:56] <MadCamel> I have to wonder if the current inflation is happening in a directed way, to put more money in certain peoples pockets. When something is poorly understood there's room for exploitation
[23:13:04] <piou> (And of course, as any programmer having read the code of such banking system could tell, when a loan is performed it's just a "+10000€" on the account, they don't wait to have something sent by the central bank, so it's practically verifiable and it's been known for quite some time)

[23:40:52] <Joanna> Mortgages aka usury have made it so that the banks own almost everything and can reclaim it as soon as you miss some payments for any reason.
[23:41:24] <gartt> Well, for cars it's the case. Often they'll charge very low interest, but you're paying that very low interest at the expense of a high price for the car
[23:41:30] <Joanna> I wonder how many people have been foreclosed on in the last two years
[23:41:52] <piou> Joanna: let's say you want to build a house. In the USA you would apply for a credit and with that money hire workers and once the house is built live in it and repay the bank with interest. The "muslim" way is different. The bank is the one paying the workers and then provides you with the house. You pay rent which repays the bank on its investment with a profit, and the contract has a provision
[23:41:58] <piou> that after X years (ie: bank fully reimbursed) the house is yours for no additional charge. No loan so no interest. However, note that the responsability is different: the bank is the one responsible for the house if there's any issue with it, with construction, or if you decide that you don't want to rent it anymore and want to leave (which you can). So they are much more involved and critical
[23:42:04] <piou> of the project you present as they may very well be the ones having to find new people to rent the place.
