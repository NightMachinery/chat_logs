[05:56:56] <[itchyjunk]> Java, i can always expect 1/2 to be .5 in double form right?
[06:03:52] <PlanckWalk> The expression "1/2" evaluates to 0
[06:03:54] <jtgd> 0.4999999999999999 ?
[06:04:51] <PlanckWalk> "1.0/2" evaluates to 0.5, though
[06:06:58] <PlanckWalk> 1/2 is representable exactly as a double value.

[06:08:18] <Hash> Do you need double to be 0.5?
[06:08:18] <PlanckWalk> I don't know which, if any, of these you meant to ask.
[06:08:21] <Hash> Why not use float?
[06:08:33] <Hash> Double consumes more memory and introduces and overflow vector

[06:09:36] <PlanckWalk> Then yes, "1.0/2.0" evalutes to 0.5
[06:09:40] <Hash> A double variable can provide precision up to 15 to 16 decimal points as compared to float precision of 6 to 7 decimal digits. Another significant difference between float and double is their storage requirement, double is more expensive than float. It takes 8 bytes to store a variable while float just takes 4 bytes.
[06:10:30] <Hash> If you're not expecting to ever use 8 bytes, then why assign 8 bytes?
[06:10:41] <Hash> If you're goig to use more than 4 bytes, then it makes sense to use 8 bytes.

[06:12:31] <Hash> Can you share code?
[06:12:33] <PlanckWalk> Hash: 4 bytes of memory is cheap and increased chance of program failure due to inappropriately short rounding is expensive.
[06:12:49] <PlanckWalk> 2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3 is true
[06:13:33] <Hash> Then that's an miscalculation in data storage
[06:13:56] <Hash> If the rounding would require a double, then use a double.

[06:20:29] <PlanckWalk> You suggested using float unless there was some specific reason to use double.
[06:20:44] <PlanckWalk> That's "by default".  If you didn't mean that, then okay.
[06:21:23] <Hash> Correct. The take away is, use the correct types for to represent your data. If it should require a double, at some unforseen point, due to scalability perhaps, then use a double and leave room. Whatever.

[10:33:45] <ChemicalRascal_> Naming convention question for everyone. Let's say you're modelling entity properties using interfaces, so something like a Book class might implement "Readable" and "Throwable" interfaces. How would you name an interface for a property not associated with a verb, in that context? Like, "can be treated as being a tube" or "has physical volume"?
[10:34:14] <espero> HasVolume?
[10:34:49] <iridium__> ChemicalRascal: Rob Pike suggests naming functions which return boolean in a way that their functioning is clear from the name.

[11:49:17] <iridium__> the corporations try to treat the devs as pretty stupid. so, the practices web developers acquire are pretty inefficient wrt to providing the web experience but is good from the corporation's point of view as they gotta pay them less and they are replaceable like a spare bolt.

[12:17:37] <bihtori> iridium__: I'm easily offended yeah
[12:17:46] <ChemicalRascal> I mean, I personally haven't developed anything for iOS, but it'd probably be cloud-based. Cloud-based stuff isn't inherently insecure or non-private. I'd write my app in, say, React Native (or Unity if it was some sort of game), and any sort of signing/publishing nonsense would be done on that cloud instance.

[18:18:48] <independent56> take question 02.02 on paper 2. I know the answer by heart: high-level languages take away most of the verbose effort.

[18:19:37] <independent56> pyzozord, When i was yr 8 and yr 7, i kept on breaking the rules. the first was because of an emailof poor taste, and the second of an external video of poor taste.
[18:20:01] <bjs> independent56: to be honest, very little of the programmer workforce out there will have the equivalent of a GCSE in CS (and really, CS is like math, and not a pre-requisite to many programmer courses)
[18:20:14] <independent56> But i am yr 11 now and i know much of the subject. 
[18:20:44] <independent56> bjs, Thanks for the reassurence, but it would look good on my CV to show that i have a high grade. 
[18:20:51] <bjs> independent56: maybe you can find an apprenticeship or internship at some small place doing web devlopment or something;  that'll be a good way to get into the industry
[18:21:03] *** Joins: cm007magnum (~Rheanna@101.89.154.192)
[18:21:10] <bjs> independent56: Sure,  I think a university will care more about a GCSE than a company would (at least with the market as it is today)
[18:21:13] <independent56> Mainly, i am worried about the coursework
[18:21:14] <independent56> good idea
[18:21:55] <bjs> independent56: obviously anything you do can be beneficial, so if you can take the exams and do well you may as well.  You should check for the exam board (your school?) subscribes to what kind of coursework they'll have
[18:22:19] *** Joins: node1 (~node1@user/node1)
[18:22:28] <independent56> yeah, i'd like to go to a collage/university. It would look better on my cv. But they are often quite permissive (Level 2 - 4-9 in 3 subjects, level 3 - 5-9 in 5 subjects)
[18:22:31] <pyzozord> independent56: what?
[18:22:42] <bjs> independent56: Some might not have any coursework at all and be 100% exam based,  others might have some coursework to make some software and write a report or something
[18:23:03] <pyzozord> you should go play fortnite or something
[18:23:15] <bjs> independent56: note that a uni course called "Computer Science" might not contain very much programming and might be a lot more maths orientated
[18:23:16] <bjs> pyzozord: what?
[18:23:20] <independent56> Hmm. I am using AQA and it says to do coursework and do 20 equivlent hours of logging.

[18:24:37] <bjs> independent56: I'm unsure what the notice at the top means,  does that mean the coursework doesn't contribute to the grade? 
[18:25:17] <independent56> Paper 2 is basically just showing you know code theory. paper 1 is all about IT and i may struggle.
[18:25:28] <bjs> the "Programming project",  you should ask your school whether you can take the exams anyway;  if you are confident they may sort it all out for you and be able to enroll you
[18:25:35] <bjs> independent56: Hmm,  you'll need to study then :)
[18:26:04] <independent56> bjs, It means that the grade of the papers have changed, but coursework is 50%. basically, there used to be a non-exam,but now it's a programming project,

[18:26:40] <bjs> independent56: Hmm,  there are 3 assessments there and the two papers are worth 50% each.  The "project" doesn't say anything.

[18:32:36] <independent56> I was just having his disccussion for better background
[18:32:38] <bjs> independent56: having a GCSE in CS will certainly help your chances at getting into College/Uni to do CS if you wanted  (but note, if you have good grades in Maths & Science it might not matter anyawy)
[18:33:06] <bjs> independent56: but you should ask yourself if the apprenticeship/internship approach is better for you, if you want to be a programmer rather than learn theory/math

[18:36:31] <independent56> An apprenticiship is basically a learning job, so a decorated CV would be brilliant.
[18:36:35] <Lyn> graduating from uni/college might be useful indeed, but main point in that is to just have a paper saying you have a uni degree -- I don't think uni is necessary for much anything, however, particularly when it comes to CS -- I'd advise you to build actual products so that you have a portfolio to show, you can genuinely land a lot of jobs by just having the portfolio to show your skills
[18:37:12] <Lyn> depending on your location, uni might be costly, in both money and time
[18:37:33] <bjs> independent56: everything builds up over time, so if you do a little project you can use that to get an internship or a uni place, and then use that to get a junior position (or higher education) and then use that ... etc
[18:37:34] <independent56> Hmm, intresting
[18:38:38] <Lyn> in a world where uni degrees are deemed very important to have, I am hesitant to advise you to simply skip uni, even though that could be the better thing to do
[18:38:59] <independent56> Intresting.
[18:39:03] <pyzozord> meh I don't know
[18:39:12] <independent56> I should note this all down
[18:39:13] <pyzozord> i haven't finished highschool and I'm doing just fine
[18:39:22] <Lyn> yeah, good example right there^
[18:40:38] <bjs> Lyn: practical experience will count for a lot, especially in many fields where they need lots of programmers to do fairly generic programming (e.g. webdev comes to mind)
[18:40:54] <bjs> obviously if you want to join DeepMind and make huge moneys,  this approach is unlikely to work :)
[18:41:03] <independent56> I am more focused on software dev.
[18:41:10] <independent56> But this may change with electron.
[18:41:16] <Lyn> I have studied a fuckton of courses at uni, and honestly, yes they teach you useful things, but the formalities are a huge drain of time, which you could use to do more useful things
[18:42:18] <bjs> independent56: sure, there's a huge world of software out there that need programmers over a wide range of skills.  Uni will teach you skills,  but skills you may or may not require for what you want to do.
[18:42:30] <bjs> and of course, unis aren't the only way to learn those skills
[18:42:45] <pyzozord> as far as I can see unis set up you to be a professor
[18:42:47] <independent56> I know, but my CV needs to look nice
[18:42:51] <pyzozord> that's cool if you want to be a professor
[18:43:01] <pyzozord> professionals don't need that much thoery and formalities
[18:43:04] <Lyn> I agree with bjs: definitely not
[18:43:39] <pyzozord> never seen any professional do anything remotely close to formal proof for anything

[18:55:13] <mawk> did you switch to protected mode yourself?
[18:55:17] <mawk> or did you cheat with grub
[18:55:38] <kobalt> I did not used grub at all
[18:56:34] <kobalt> I wanted to make a display driver but realised it's complexity.
[18:57:12] <mawk> I used the VESA extension to set the right vga mode to "HD"
[18:57:30] <mawk> then you get a framebuffer for the whole screen in true colors and you can draw pixel by pixel
[18:57:47] <mawk> but real graphics card in the real world do not support that, nowadays it's 100% proprietary stuff to setup the card; or the open spec VGA
[18:57:48] <mawk> I think

[22:20:18] <pyzozord> must provide some kind of service that many websites will want to install

[22:21:20] <pyzozord> yeah that's true, me too
[22:21:38] <Inari> you also want some sorta permanence though

[22:22:12] <bayaz> Title: Code mobility - Wikipedia 
[22:22:49] <pyzozord> it could be an alternative for ads thought. You whitelist sites you want to support, or that you return to frequently. They get to use some of your cpu resources, they rent those resources to the cloud and sell them to people and earn some money
[22:23:32] <pyzozord> it seems much better solution then ads, and I bet cpu usage is kind of comperable really
[22:24:47] <pyzozord> you don't see weird ads and you don't get spied on, websites you like get supported, less electronical waste is produced because less is bought by server farms because some of that compute is offloaded to consumer machines
[22:25:34] <pyzozord> that compute could be anything like 3d render jobs, or ai training jobs

[23:51:12] <nucleargrave> hello all, I'm currently one of the lead backend engineers at my company and most of my interview experience is using referrals or project based. Also i've predominately grown the team through referrals where I brought in people that I have enjoyed working with before.  Now I'm onto interviewing candidates and I don't really want to pick arbitrary leet code style interview questions that test
[23:51:15] <nucleargrave> algorithm skills that will likely never be relevant here. I do think data structures and algorithms are absolutely important but I'm not going to ask someone to solve a minimum spanning tree problem when their main responsibility will be to maintain and expand a CRUD application and that is why I'm here.  I would like to gauge someones knowledge of programming and OOP Does anyone here have
[23:51:17] <nucleargrave> any resources / recommendations / experience that they could share ? I'd ideally like a solid exercise(s?)  to demonstrate fundamentals as well as something that demonstrates basic data structure fundamentals and any resources ideas would be appreciated.

[23:54:08] <vdamewood> nucleargrave: Also, what does OOP mean to you? It's come to mean different things to different people and sometimes they do and sometimes they don't match up.
[23:54:13] <nucleargrave> vdamewood: fair enough, that question is just so common, i'd prefer to avoid starting with something like that (
