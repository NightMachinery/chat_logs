[00:29:58] <jokoon> flex-direction: column; column-count: 4; doesn't seem to work... what am I missing?
[00:35:26] <jokoon> oh sorry it's not related to flex
[00:40:39] <jokoon> can flexbox automatically resize the height of the container to fill all space?
[00:48:12] *** Joins: vysn (~vysn@user/vysn)
[00:53:50] <Rainier> jokoon, of a flex child or of the flex container?
[00:54:10] <jokoon> of the flex container
[00:54:33] <jokoon> I want elements to balance themselves and fill empty space
[00:54:39] <jokoon> on several columns
[00:55:22] <Rainier> Er, I'm confused now. That sounds like you want to adjust the flex children. For the parent you could do height: 100%; assuming the parent is a fixed height (and not also height: 100%; or similar). Or you could make the parent of the flex container also flex and set the current flex element to be flex-grow: 1;
[00:55:27] <jokoon> and possibly automatically increase the column count
[00:56:11] <jokoon> I want the container to adapt its height depending on the quantity of items
[00:56:35] <jokoon> not sure it's possible
[00:57:27] <jokoon> Im using flex-direction: column;
[00:57:40] <Rainier> To some extent that's already going to happen. As you add more items it should continue to expand down.
[00:57:51] <Rainier> Unless you have something else in play that limits the height of the flex container.
[00:58:17] <jokoon> It makes only a single column for some reason
[00:58:34] <jokoon> when I remove the height:
[01:00:08] *** Joins: aristippos (~aristippo@cupola.whatbox.ca)
[01:00:15] <Rainier> Well yes, because if you have no height restriction the item will grow downwards as much as there are elements and since there's no height restriction there's no need to wrap.
[01:00:39] <jokoon> ok
[01:00:51] <Rainier> You can't have it both ways. You either get a fixed height and wrapping or sized based on elements and no wrapping. The only way to fix this would be to calculate the fixed height you desire and set it directly.
[01:01:43] <jokoon> too bad
[01:03:56] <Rainier> It sounds like what you want might be closer to the CSS multicolumn proposal, but no browser completely implemented that.
[01:04:02] <Rainier> At least as far as I'm aware.
[01:04:11] <jokoon> oh
[01:04:13] <Rainier> It's working, you just may not be able to use all the feature the spec says are available.
[01:04:30] <jokoon> ok, well at least Im learning something

[01:05:37] <Selvvir> Rainier, CSS 3 multi-column layout: Howto: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_multi-column_layouts Spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/ Caniuse: http://caniuse.com/#feat=multicolumn
[01:06:09] <Rainier> `set/a multicolumn = css column
[01:07:24] <Rainier> jokoon, multicolumn layout lets you set the number of columns you want, and it'll try to fit everything into those columns, expanding downwards based on content, rather than trying to work out how to set a height to get the right number of columns, etc. as you would have to do with flexbox.
[01:07:30] <Rainier> See the links above for info on how to try it out.

[01:22:57] <jokoon> weirdly, I have a case where the first column has 2 rows, while other rows has 3
[01:24:55] <Rainier> If it's always that way you can insert spacer items or other tricks... like the parent of the multicolumn layout can have a :before or :after that you can sort of try to move around to get a space, iirc.

[19:46:42] <jokoon> any simple way to put an element at the bottom of its parent
[19:48:16] <Rockwood> may ways
[19:48:24] <Rockwood> many
[19:48:30] <Rockwood> like grid
[19:49:07] <Rockwood> you can do padding top
[19:51:06] <jokoon> any sample for padding top?
[19:54:45] <Rockwood> means?
[19:55:15] <jokoon> what did you mean by "you can do padding top"? do you have an example?

[20:01:04] <Rockwood> jokoon, https://jsfiddle.net/kfsjbo3p/1/ i think i got example
[20:01:22] <Rockwood> sorry margin is better option for this
[20:02:03] <jokoon> doesn't work if I resize
[20:02:13] <Rockwood> then you need grid
[20:02:23] <Rockwood> with media query
[20:02:46] <Rockwood> better way as far as i can guess about that

[23:04:07] <teut> why is the text wrapping?
[23:04:51] <teut> and how to increase the  -  's height?
[23:05:01] <teut> i tried line-height: 1.5rem but no effect
[23:07:39] <teut> I need a single line infinite   move
[23:08:48] <hassoon> teut: https://jsfiddle.net/vyqxdcz5/
[23:09:36] <teut> oh damn it, white-space was breaking it
[23:09:47] <teut> why didnt  word-wrap:nowrap worked?
[23:09:54] <teut> isnt - a word?
[23:10:38] <teut> and how to make it go on continuously?
[23:10:52] <teut> left to right infinite trial
[23:11:33] <teut> trail *
[23:12:08] <teut> https://niroggyan.com/how-it-works  like here
[23:12:50] <teut> there on this site I can see the throttle effect
[23:12:58] <teut> I need it smooth
[23:19:45] <teut> https://jsfiddle.net/5drpg6au/2/
[23:19:51] <teut> need help with this
[23:20:43] <teut> so the second h1 moves  0 % to 100%  , but the first one will be hidden by translate(-100%)  , now they both should move
[23:21:01] <teut> need it like a cycle
[23:24:20] <teut> https://jsfiddle.net/5drpg6au/3/  ok just how to inline it?
[23:24:26] <teut> rest is done
[23:26:36] <teut> https://jsfiddle.net/5drpg6au/4/   display:inline-box doesnt work
[23:30:43] <hassoon> teut: https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/409
[23:30:56] <hassoon> teut: don't use text to render that moving snake
[23:31:19] <teut> ah right word , moving snake
[23:32:42] <teut> what a trick with bgcolor
[23:33:04] <hassoon> that's not a trick, that's a better approach
[23:34:52] <teut> https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle/411
[23:35:18] <teut> why cant I see multiple elements at one time?
[23:38:07] <teut> when your left is 0 you translate it to -100%, this also is mind-bending
[23:38:21] <teut> nice methods, thanks hassoon
