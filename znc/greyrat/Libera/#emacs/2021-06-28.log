[04:16:19] <dminuoso> What could go wrong.
[04:16:43] <dminuoso> grym: Also, it's a common misconception that a pure language cant express side effects.

[04:23:37] <dminuoso> And its only monad style because it was polymorphized right at the beginning
[04:24:10] <kakuhen> this is like arguing physicists don't need group theory because their standard model already had the same constructs before they realized that they reinvented groups
[04:24:14] <dminuoso> Other languages like JavaScript attained similar grammatical constructs such async/await doing a similar trick - the core essence is the same, albeit having no mathematical foundation.

[04:25:32] <dminuoso> This to me reads as an attempt to yourself as well versed in category theory, and that one needs to have a degree in mathematics to even understand it. This is problematic for several reasons.
[04:25:44] <kakuhen> I literally did not imply that at all

[06:14:54] <kit> my issue comes from how the emacs daemon has the working directory set to wherever the daemon was started, so that if I open emacsclient from a specific directory that I want to navigate in I need to provide the directory as an argument to emacsclient (or navigate through my fs everytime)
[06:15:21] <kit> I could avoid the behaviour by not passing the directory but then I would walk into more annoying behaviour by not being in the directory I want to be in
[06:15:36] <bremner> kit: try  emacsclient -t -e '(dired nil)' 
[06:15:59] <bremner> kit: try  emacsclient -t -e '(dired ".")'

[06:17:29] <kit> I figure I must be using emacs the wrong way or something
[06:17:39] <bremner> kit: because you used 'a' instead of RET to option the file, you told it to close the dired buffer

[06:18:26] <kit> bremner: If I use `emacsclient -nw .`, use dired to open a file using RET... this opens a file as a buffer. If I then use kill-buffer on the dired buffer (not the buffer of the file I have now opened), the client will also close
[06:18:43] <bremner> ok. So don't kill that buffer?
[06:18:50] <bremner> why do you need to kill the dired buffer?
[06:19:19] <MysteriousSilver> inkbottle[m]: use straight.el
[06:19:46] <inkbottle[m]> If I copy `https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/blob/master/eglot.el` in `~/.emacs.d/lisp/`, would that be sufficient? And how to tell emacs to use that version instead of the melpa version?
[06:20:35] <kit> bremner: Maybe I dont need to kill the dired buffer. I guess one motivation could be not leave unused dired buffers open forever. I was more just curious for why the behaviour is what it is. It doesnt make sense to me. Like if I'm working in emacs for a while and then go back and close all the buffers I'm no longer using I may unintentionally close the client.

[06:22:19] <bremner> kit: that's how emacs client works. if you went "emacsclient -t foo.txt" and killed the foo.txt buffer, it would close

[08:08:59] <Aurora_v_kosmose> :p
[08:09:03] <johnjay> i ask because i tried reading the guile scheme manual a while ago but the first chapter on compiling a module gave errors
[08:09:28] <johnjay> that would render a lot of the subsequent chapters irrelevant since the entire point of guile is to integrate it with something

[08:11:39] <johnjay> i guess what i'm getting at is if the ultimate point is to write working code, and the manual your reading is never going to do that for you... well why bother

[10:35:44] <teknikal_domain> reading farther than "selecting entire elements in a tree" is pain.
[10:35:45] <Aurora_v_kosmose> I'll let someone else have the "fun" to implement it.

[18:43:57] <wgreenhouse> they both offer channel tracking in the mode line, and both also let you visit any channel buffer by name (as channels are just emacs buffers)
[18:44:26] <bremner> ,,ibuffer,, can also be used to good effect

[19:56:25] <inkbottle[m]> As if using `:header-args: :tangle yes` on one entry, would cause `org` to assume every other entries bear an implicit `:header-args: :tangle no`, unless stated otherwise.

[20:19:40] <tricon> humasect: So I had the 2016 MacBook Pro, which was the first MBP with the butterfly keys. At first I enjoyed them. They had a slight, very soft "click" to them I thought I would enjoy, though I couldn't type reliably on them. New keyboards take time to get used to, right?. However that tactile feel wore out, and 2 years later, I could not type accurately on them, and my hands started hurting because it felt like I was constantly jamming

[20:21:37] <jimeh> As for what I think about the butterfly switches, when I got my 2016 in December 2016, the first 15 minutes they felt weird, but then I got used to them, and it quickly became my favorite keyboard ever, cause I liked the very short key travel, and the very thin gap between each key… however about three years in a few keys started failing so I had to bring it to Apple to replace the keyboard…

[21:21:38] <sbilik> OK, I remember trying to tinker with it a while back but having hiccups. I know shell-mode works smoothly on my linux boxes, but my main Office env is always Windows 10 so I do what I can there to make it as easy as it is in Linux.
[21:22:06] <wasamasa> consider using eshell

[21:24:23] <wasamasa> that adds spaces

[21:28:15] <wasamasa> it's the shell not understanding /
