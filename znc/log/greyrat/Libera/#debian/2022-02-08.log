[01:21:47] <somiaj> Na_Klar: yea, ports can sometimes be slow to update info, https://www.ports.debian.org/contacts, maybe seend the ftpmaster a note that the key being shown has expired.
[01:22:53] <Na_Klar> somiaj: still same error xo
[01:23:17] <somiaj> do you have older keys on your system you need to remove to it uses the correct one?
[01:23:52] <Na_Klar> I moved the old ones out of the /etc tree
[01:26:00] <Na_Klar> but since it is always the same key ID which fails to sign, I have a feeling that there is somewhere else the key apt uses. I cleaned everything in /etc/apt and /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d

[01:58:16] <Khepra> that's one way, I guess. What I prefer is a "sftp" group match, where they're sftp chrooted and can't ssh

[01:59:12] <Khepra> if you set their shells to nologin, you won't be able to su (or even sudo methinks) as those users which may not be what you want.
[01:59:14] <hiya> Khepra: how to do it?
[02:00:11] <Khepra> hiya: google for  openssh sftp chroot. in short, create a custom group for such users, and then have a Match Group stanza that forces command internalsftp and does ChrootDirectory
[02:00:39] <Khepra> the prerequisite for this is that their homedirs are owned by root (could be root:theirregulargroup) and not writable by group or others
[02:01:02] <Khepra> so they can't upload or create or mkdir at the top of their chroots/homedirs.
[02:01:59] <hiya> Khepra: can they upload to other directories otherwise?

[02:04:53] <Khepra> it only depends what your end goal really is. nologin shells may or may not do exactly what you want.
[02:05:19] <Khepra> to limit users to sftp only and prevent regular ssh login, it's literally three lines in sshd_config and a specific chown+chmod on their homedirs.
[02:05:53] <Khepra> docker was designed to containerize single processes. if you're abusing docker as a VM with full SSH login ..... YoureDoingItWrong(tm) :)

[03:25:57] <dminuoso> I have a mostly-debian based linux switch, and I want to bake a particular package (sssd) into the ONIE image so I can install it at zero-touch time before networking goes up
[03:25:57] <greycat> then my best answer would be to trace through the dependencies by hand
[03:26:18] <dminuoso> Or rather, its potentially fine to happen after networking goes up
[03:26:21] <greycat> ,depends sssd
[03:26:23] <judd> Package sssd in bullseye/amd64 -- depends: python3-sss (= 2.4.1-2), sssd-ad (= 2.4.1-2), sssd-common (= 2.4.1-2), sssd-ipa (= 2.4.1-2), sssd-krb5 (= 2.4.1-2), sssd-ldap (= 2.4.1-2), sssd-proxy (= 2.4.1-2).
[03:26:27] <dminuoso> But the sssd I want is not in the upstream repositories configured
[03:27:19] <dminuoso> The more I think about it, I need the entire dependency tree since its preferrable to do this as zero touch time before networking is available

[06:31:40] <johnjaye> i looked at /var/apt/history.log and it looked like it was downloading or updateing openssh

[13:17:12] <dminuoso> jelly: Mmm, okay dpkg-scanpackages looks handy. So let me give a bit of background. I want to have zero touch provisioning of a debian based switch, and during that I want to install a package that has dependencies both in the existing repository, and in a foreign one. Network access at the time is not present.
[13:17:16] <Ueb> jelly is it ok in your opinion?
[13:17:22] <dminuoso> So my question is: Can you provide a file:// repository?
[13:17:40] <dminuoso> And then I would just toss all deb files in there, dpkg-scanpackages, and then run `apt install foo`?

[13:24:04] <dminuoso> The route via a repository is beginning to seem useless

[14:10:20] <jelly> they have a backup internet link on the same local LAN
[14:10:33] <Khepra> Ueb: how often does it happen and why can't you have a simple, single stanza, and you just change the gateway entry, restart networking, if one fails.
[14:10:55] <Khepra> jelly: something something bonding, then?
[14:11:00] <Ueb> it happens 1-2 a year
[14:11:19] <jelly> bonding can't work with different routes
[14:11:45] <Khepra> Ueb: right, so you just quickly edit the gateway and restaqrt the service.
[14:12:06] <Khepra> jelly: two vlans, one cable?
[14:12:09] <Ueb> Khepra yes I could manually change it on /etc/network/interfaces, but will be necessary a network restart
[14:12:14] <jelly> same vlan.
[14:12:21] <Khepra> I mean if they created two vlans
[14:12:58] <Khepra> but 1-2 times a year, this sounds like terribly wasted time.  VASTLY more joules are spent in this convo, than what would be spent to just update the gateway and restart networking. twice a year. for the next ten years.
[14:13:45] <jelly> assuming they're on site and able to do that
[14:14:27] <Khepra> it can be automated. ping test for example + a quick sed of ONE line.   really no need for aliased interfaces and complexities as noted in the paste
[14:14:38] <jelly> Ueb, quick hack would be a to make a script that detects outage, switches just the default route, and then detects when the primary is back and falls back
[14:15:02] <Khepra> the only problem is properly detecting outage.
[14:15:04] <Ueb> jelly yes, that's a good idea
[14:15:33] <jelly> you would need a host on the internet to test, and a separate route for it that always goes over the primary link gateway
[14:15:45] <Khepra> another option..... weighted gateways and systemd-networkd magic.
[14:16:20] <jelly> still need a way to test the link, and merely testing whether the gw is up is not enough
[14:17:09] <Ueb> ok, if it's not doable I at least need to create a script for switching them
[14:17:22] <jelly> also, all the tcp connections break when you switch gw regardless of how it's done
[14:17:44] <jelly> because different outbound IP
[14:18:03] <Khepra> Ueb: what is "not doable"? we're suggesting you to manually, or scripted'ly, alter _single_ gateway entry of a single iface stanza of your interfaces(5).

[14:47:45] <Khepra> jelly: but restart is just ifdown followed by ifup even on jessie:  https://sources.debian.org/src/ifupdown/0.7.53.1/debian/networking.init/

[14:48:22] <Khepra> so I don't understand why this would fail and manually ifdown followed by ifup wouldn't.  maybe due to the pause between them caused by typing?

[14:49:46] <jelly> I see it avoids to ifdown lo, which was one of the issues.
[14:50:17] <Ueb> "ifdown eth0" followed by "ifup eth0" ?
[14:50:56] <Khepra> Ueb: yes. make a few seconds pause between them, if the problem jelly mentions is what I think it is
[14:51:56] <Khepra> I do actually remember having to pause between down and up. changing IPs remotely over ssh.... over tmux.... ifdown ... ; sleep 5; ifup ...    ; but taht was one of worst case scenarios: changing ips on the fly

[14:55:14] <jelly> and then work on a schedule to release upgrades.
[14:55:42] <jelly> because "upgrade to N+3" is easy to say and hard to do
[14:56:46] <jelly> and in the meantime LTS or ELTS is better than running 8.4
[14:57:13] <Khepra> nooooo. reinstalllllll. format CCCCCCC:\   nowwwwwwww. doooo eeeeeeeet. nowwwwwwww.

[19:25:56] <Khepra> andre144k: what kind of user? console/DE/WM logged in user? human  user?
[19:28:09] <andre144k> WM, local user starts automatically. then remote users login via ssh/vnc
[19:28:54] <andre144k> i want restrict this local users as far as possible - maybe only use this virtualbox nothing else
[19:29:20] <andre144k> virtualbox as application, to manage more then one vm
[19:30:17] <Khepra> it's not as simple. there is a ton of "moving pieces" in what needs to be executed or accessed to start and manipulate virtualbox.
[19:30:34] <andre144k> yes
[19:30:47] *** Joins: dez (uid92154@user/dez)
[19:30:52] <Khepra> "use only virtualbox" also means use the shell, its libs, display manager, its libs, its configs, the WM, its libs, its configs, etc...
[19:31:12] <Khepra> best tool for that is SELinux as you can attach context to roles and roles to UIDs.
[19:31:41] <Khepra> migth be possible via apparmor, but I'm not 100% sure how to go about attaching an AA profile to a login, unless you spawned a dedicated sshd just for them, you can easily put that sshd only under an AA profile.
[19:31:51] <Khepra> but the pattern here is: mandatory access control.
[19:32:16] <Khepra> MIGHT be possible with a rather large and convoluted ACList assigned to many different paths, but that's just painful.
[19:32:26] <Khepra> alternatively: custom sshd + namespace/container.
[19:33:09] <PerfDave> Could set up the local user to only run the Virtualbox GUI app in an X session, for starters (rather than using a WM/DE to launch it)
[19:33:38] <Khepra> yeah but how do you constrain the ssh user to only attach to taht session
[19:33:42] <andre144k> hmm ok... maybe easier to build a start/stop/restart script for virtual mashines via commandline
[19:34:14] <andre144k> and allow via rbash

[19:34:53] <PerfDave> Khepra: I thought andre144k wanted people to SSH into the VMs themselves, not the desktop session running the manager, but I could be wrong.
[19:36:01] <Khepra> "virtualbox as application, to manage more then one vm"   .. I understood from this they want that user to manage the hypervisor
[19:36:10] <andre144k> PerfDave, yes but need to rights for start/stop/restart vms also
[19:36:24] <Khepra> I'm not sure rbash is going to do entirely what you think it would
[19:36:43] <Khepra> without a MAC or a restricted context like a namespace, folks will find ways to execute things via secondary gadgets.
[19:37:12] <Khepra> launch vim, exec stuff from vim, as a random OTOH example.
[19:37:51] <PerfDave> You could have a management script that's the only thing the user can execute over SSH using "command" in authorized_keys?
[19:38:09] *** Joins: raden (~raden@204.220.159.1)
[19:38:28] <Khepra> or make your life simpler and run an sshd jsut for them in a container that has nothing but a shell and vbox-manager-cli-thingy-whatever
[19:40:18] <PerfDave> There are a multitude of approaches; I'm familiar with using restricted commands via SSH already so I'd probably just go that route.
[19:40:35] <Khepra> if I were to do it, I'd use selinux or apparmored separate sshd. it's easy to launch another sshd, on another port, under a specified apparmor profile.
[19:41:15] <Khepra> this way you can be 100% sure only the whitelisted paths may be accessed, even through secondary gadgets, or even if the user somehow becomes root.
[19:41:40] <Khepra> the only way this wouldn't work is if there's a kernel vulnerability and the user exploits it to drop the MAC context.

[23:48:01] <acu> Is Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX210 recognized in Debian 11.2 ?  Debian 11.2 has kernel 5.10 - it suppose to have driver for it - I am confused https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/iwlwifi

[23:49:21] <sney> yes, though you also need the firmware-iwlwifi package in order for the driver to load
[23:49:33] *** Joins: heichblatt (~hke@user/heichblatt)
[23:50:34] <acu> sney: thanks let me try --- however, I downloade nonfree firmware iso for Debian 11.2 and it did not recognize the Intel AX210 during install - so I need to do something after installation through ethernet ?
[23:50:53] <sney> no, if you used the non-free iso then you already have the contents of that package.
[23:51:06] <sney> I have seen at least one device that was detected as "ax210/ax410" or something like that which required a newer kernel too, I guess there are some devices that are borderline
[23:51:14] <acu> that is what I thought - but it does not see it -
[23:52:52] <sney> it's reasonable to guess that if support was brand new in 5.10, it may be better in a newer kernel anyway. bullseye-backports has 5.15, try that.
[23:55:38] <acu> sney: thanks, I really tried to avoid that - the ideea is to use my laptop - and generate virtual machines in kvm and virt-manager - that I can easy move to a production server ---- starting adding backport - messes the versions ---- it seem that that is only option - but I am not happy with that - it would be great if I could just compile the driver for it...
[23:56:27] <acu> I know it works with Ubuntu 21.10 - it has kernel 5.13 - but the whole ideea is to use the laptop with absolutely same kernel and applications version as the server
[23:57:25] <acu> there are some other applications I need to run - and try to keep software consistent
[23:58:17] <sney> it might not be impossible to backport iwlwifi from a newer kernel, but I'm not sure where you'd start with that. and that would make your host kernel inconsistent with your VMs anyway.
[23:58:32] <StyXman> acu: do you have any dependency on the kernel version on the stuff you're going to run? if not, then nevermind
[23:58:34] <sney> some newer hardware simply needs newer kernels, that's just how it is
[23:59:07] <StyXman> (meaning, use the newer ekrnel ands stop worrying about it:)
