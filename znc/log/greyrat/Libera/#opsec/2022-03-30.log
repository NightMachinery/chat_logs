[02:27:19] <Joanna> Hi everyone
[02:31:03] <Joanna> I think that being forced to use one identity is the opposite of freedom. Most countries force people to use just one identify for everything so people can be tracked and controlled easier. People have to get permission from the government to use their own name and not even being able to have ownership of your name and change it whenever you like shows how disempowered you are.
[02:33:25] <Joanna> Just about everything people do requires government permission sometimes even being allowed outside. It amazes me how people see nothing wrong with being treated like livestock or property.
[02:34:41] <Joanna> It was once possible to have any new identity you wanted by simply using the new name publicly.

[03:00:24] <jessicara> Joanna: depends which country, in the uk you don't really have a 'legal name' as such
[03:00:52] <jessicara> i could decide tomorrow to call myself ahmed khan or something, and so long as it's not for fraudulent purposes it's entirely legal to switch
[03:02:26] <jessicara> this is actually what confuses me greatly about the gender wars in the uk, it's literally a title on an irrelevant piece of paper that people are fighting over
[03:04:47] <jessicara> something which might be fun to think of is that there is a secret interpretation of the law, imagine how loose that is if this is the public interpretation of what legitimate means
[03:10:53] <jan6> 01:01 <Joanna> I think that being forced to use one identity is the opposite of freedom
[03:10:58] <jan6> yes and no
[03:11:06] <jan6> well
[03:11:10] <jan6> "yes, but"
[03:11:27] <jan6> if you allow unlimited aliases, then it becomes really hard to enforce anything
[03:11:50] <jan6> or prove anything for that matter
[03:12:54] <jessicara> i don't think it's illegal to lie on the internet to big companies who aren't dealing with anything of importance legally
[03:13:01] <jan6> that, of course
[03:13:10] <jessicara> so in effect, you can have an alias
[03:14:33] <jan6> for non-governmental entities the worst they can do for using non-legal name, but not impersonating, is just throwing you off the platform
[03:14:42] <jan6> assuming they care about it in the first place
[03:14:43] <jessicara> pretty much
[03:15:16] <jan6> e.g. facebook SAYS you have to use real name, even in ToS, but there's thousands of fake named accounts, lol
[03:15:21] <jessicara> indeed
[03:15:24] <jan6> if not millions
[03:16:12] <jessicara> something which is actually kinda concerning is the lack of understanding the law in the uk
[03:16:25] <jan6> everywhere, actually
[03:17:06] <jessicara> like, people ask for photo id
[03:17:12] <jessicara> there is no such thing as photo id in the uk?
[03:17:13] <jessicara> lol
[03:17:21] <jessicara> even at banks
[03:17:30] <jan6> laws keep getting more tricky to navigate, too, which doesn't help (e.g. there's law X, with sub-law Y, and then a different law's paragraph N also applies, but not if lay Z's subparagrapn R does)
[03:17:34] <jessicara> there is no such requirement even to open an account
[03:17:56] <jan6> there doesn't HAVE to be a requirement
[03:17:56] <jan6> lol
[03:17:58] <jessicara> just need proof of residence and birth cerficate matching to prevent fraud
[03:18:14] <jessicara> proof of evidence can be a utility bill
[03:18:18] <jessicara> residence*
[03:18:32] <jan6> nothing's saying they CAN'T require a "photo ID" either, tho, is there? ;P
[03:18:34] <jessicara> yeah there is not much requirements
[03:18:45] <jessicara> well, if there is no such thing as photo id
[03:18:54] <jan6> they can just define one
[03:18:57] <jessicara> then requiring it means 100% of people are unable to use it
[03:19:08] <jessicara> so, it's a bs thing
[03:19:18] <jessicara> might even lose in court if try to fight that
[03:19:59] <jan6> "Photo identification or photo ID is an identity document that includes a photograph of the holder, usually only their face. The most commonly accepted forms of photo ID are those issued by government authorities, such as driver's licenses, identity cards and passports, but special-purpose photo IDs may be also produced, such as internal security or access control cards. "
[03:20:21] <jan6> if they don't specify what, then you could just DIY one ;P
[03:20:46] <jan6> there is such a thing everywhere
[03:20:53] * jessicara doesn't have one
[03:22:21] <jan6> and again, you can DIY one, if they require one, citing that by law you don't need one, and you don't have a passport, ID card, driver's license, or anything of the sort, with your photo
[03:23:36] <Joanna> JimBuntu: some days are kind of quiet in here others not :)
[03:25:40] <Joanna> jessicara: can you decide a new name and get employment and be paid without government Permission though? By government permission I mean a document provided by the government providing permission to use that name
[03:26:21] <jessicara> yeah
[03:26:51] <jessicara> the thing they care about is honesty when deal with taxes and benefits
[03:27:02] <jessicara> so long as all those are squared away it's fine
[03:27:29] <jessicara> anything legitimate legally is fine - no harassing people on other names or double-benefit-payments
[03:28:21] <jessicara> otherwise, don't hide work
[03:30:04] <Joanna> When people claim there will be fraud without government in control that is just a pretext for more and more control. There used to be this thing called reputation and a stranger who just shows up had to prove that they are trustworthy before being trusted.
[03:30:56] <jessicara> the way things are now, even with such lax rules, it's seemingly quite hard to get away with fraud using your own identities as opposed to a huge string of other illegal things to use another's
[03:32:58] <jan6> well, even if it's illegal, if you want to do illegal things, it wouldn't be that hard to lie about your name, and produce a fake ID card or such, which would probably fool casual observers who can't query official databases
[03:33:25] <jessicara> yeah
[03:33:28] <jan6> and most places only care about your name as "what should we refer to you as" anyway
[03:33:36] <jessicara> very much this
[03:34:12] <Joanna> There is actually more fraud relying on government to vouch for strangers to determine if they are trustworthy, also I consider having to show a birth certificate having to get permission from the government. How long has it been like that? See that is how they ease people into photo I’d they will claim that people are using other people’s birth certificates to commit fraud and SOMETHING MUST BE DONE TO MAKE US SAFE FROM IDENTITY 
[03:34:12] <Joanna> THEFT AND TERRORISM!!
[03:34:34] <jan6> uh, you don't trust government for the trustworthyness
[03:35:15] <jan6> a totally shady dude with a government ID isn't automatically more trustworthy than a clearly honest one who doesn't have one
[03:35:32] <jan6> you only trust that for the IDENTITY
[03:35:52] <Joanna> jessicara: the real ID always starts off easy to get and then once most people have it they tighten up and make more requirements to have it.
[03:35:53] <jan6> "is it true that you are $NAME"
[03:36:44] <jan6> unless it's the law, then you can just find alternatives, or break their rules
[03:36:53] <jessicara> oh it was tried here to have centralized ids
[03:37:03] <jan6> even if it is the law, it depends whether anyone cares
[03:37:12] <jessicara> even tried it on specifically transgender people because thought it would be easier if target a minority
[03:37:15] <jessicara> still failed
[03:37:17] <jessicara> lol
[03:37:19] <Joanna> When you go to a bank in the us the bank totally trusts the government ID. Everything I can think of trusts the government ID completely.
[03:37:19] <jan6> lol
[03:37:32] <jan6> you don't trust the PERSON tho, Joanna 
[03:37:36] <jan6> you trust the IDENTITY
[03:37:47] <jan6> you trust that "you are who you say you are", not "you are trustworthy"
[03:38:20] <jan6> because otherwise who's to stop you from driving around the country, and opening up 50 different bank accounts, and starting money laundering?
[03:38:39] <Joanna> I’m not trustworthy if I don’t have the %#@& ID !
[03:38:52] <jan6> it's not trust
[03:39:47] <jan6> it's assurance you are who you say you are, because otherwise it's really hard for them to prevent abuse, without biometrics or such invasive stuff
[03:40:41] <jan6> again, otherwise you could open up 50 bank accounts all over the place, and not have them linked to you, but to 50 different names, assumed to be 50 different people
[03:40:58] <Joanna> Yep that’s their technique accuse ordinary people of being criminals and look the other way when billionaire criminals do their thing. If people had any self respect they would be insulted by such accusations and vote with their feet out the door.
[03:42:17] <jan6> uh, again with your massive bias
[03:42:35] <jan6> they're different classes of problems
[03:42:38] <Joanna> Damn straight!
[03:42:38] <jan6> often linked
[03:43:18] <jan6> these billionaires would have it even EASIER to pretend "hey, I don't have that much income, seeeee?" and have alter egos who get the rest
[03:43:48] <Joanna> If people valued their freedom and privacy they wouldn’t have government in the middle of every transaction. They enjoy being permanent children it seems.
[03:45:35] <jan6> just declare that you want either anarchy, or people like you to compose the entire government
[03:45:49] <jan6> EVERYONE's a kid pretending to be an adult
[03:45:50] <Joanna>  There is always a way around every rule for billionaires starting with paying taxes. They control the people who write the laws! In fact the federal reserve is a privately owned bank that lends money to the government. Do you think they pay taxes ?
[03:46:05] <jan6> sure
[03:46:10] <jan6> but it doesn't matter if they do
[03:47:57] <jan6> and I'm pretty dang sure they either do, or have a public contract that while they're the reserve, that money doesn't count for taxes, but they still pay for their normal operations
