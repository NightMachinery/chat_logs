[00:02:16] <blackpill0w> not sure that paying for support would help a regular user though
[00:02:27] <sentionics> if women pound me in the ass, does that make me gay?
[00:02:58] <lastonestanding> with a plug
[00:03:06] <sentionics> not with a plug
[00:03:09] <blackpill0w> sentionics, if it's only a finger it's probably okay, but you shouldn't go so far, SIZE MATTER
[00:03:23] <Terminus> blackpill0w: simple. regular user doesn't know what he's doing so he pays somebody else to do it for him.
[00:03:38] <sentionics> my cock needs supplementation
[00:03:50] <blackpill0w> Terminus, very regular user wouldn't touch linux in the first place
[00:04:10] <blackpill0w> also, distros like Mint and Ubuntu don't break that much
[00:04:23] <sentionics> I manage to satisfy despite what little I got
[00:05:06] <Terminus> blackpill0w: there's always somebody who'll need support.
[00:05:06] <blackpill0w> satisfy who -_o
[00:05:16] <sentionics> your mom

[00:55:55] <sentionics> I'm messed up at the moment though
[00:56:51] <Cryowolf> I dunno. I don't work well with others when it comes to writing my story in my world with my lore and characters etc. The only thing I can use (and cant pay for) is an illustrator or a java programmer and scripter in case I want to make it into a VN
[00:57:08] <sentionics> ah, fair enough.
[00:57:22] <sentionics> I'm not that great with others either tbh
[00:57:40] <Cryowolf> I've spent like hundreds of hours on juist world building
[00:57:41] <sentionics> I am a god though

[00:57:53] <blackpill0w> that's probably why we're here

[00:58:09] <blackpill0w> makes sense

[00:58:12] <sentionics> aye mate
[00:58:35] <sentionics> I won't impose on you

[01:01:58] <Cryowolf> I know addictions don't just go away simply cause you don't want it or they're bad. Or because somebody told you "you have to quit ok?". Even if forced into rehab, unless you wanted to quit, not a chance it's gonna last. You have to find it within yourself the motivation and the why and use that as a wrecking ball to tear down that ugly piece of shit building your mind is currently living in
[01:02:06] <Cryowolf> ¨I know this by experience
[01:03:08] <sentionics> Thanks for that Cryowolf 
[01:03:57] <Cryowolf> sure np. I know that not a lot ofpeople understand what it's like to be in self-destruction
[01:03:58] <sentionics> It's as you say. In the end, unless I want to quit...
[01:04:17] <Cryowolf> yeh
[01:04:25] <sentionics> this sucks
[01:04:47] <Cryowolf> but when you do decide to quit, remember that the hardest part is over
[01:05:01] <Cryowolf> getting to "I'm going to quit and that's that" for real, not just for a day
[01:05:07] <sentionics> the decision? 
[01:05:09] <Cryowolf> that's the greatest struggle
[01:05:12] <Cryowolf> yes
[01:05:20] <Cryowolf> that's the greatest struggle
[01:06:13] <sentionics> maybe I can be sober one day
[01:06:19] <sentionics> I want to
[01:06:27] <sentionics> I just lack something
[01:06:39] <sentionics> the reason in the first place
[01:06:48] <sentionics> I'm angry at life I guess
[01:07:02] <Cryowolf> I had no specific reason for quitting. well I did but. It wasn't external
[01:07:08] <Cryowolf> Itwas all internals tuff
[01:07:11] <sentionics> I'm a dog barking at a tree
[01:07:40] <sentionics> Cryowolf, the internal shit is everything
[01:07:53] <blackpill0w> you might not have something to fight for, I feel like this a lot
[01:08:24] <sentionics> :)
[01:08:31] <sentionics> we can overcome
[01:08:50] <sentionics> no need to feel so down, we got this
[01:09:50] <Cryowolf> I quit because I had come to a point where I hated myself, I loathed myself. If I saw myself walking down the street, I'd go to the otherside or spit on myself. I hated every part of me. I was also being worn down, physically and mentally. I sleep walked, sort of, in a dangerous way. Armed with a knife and all. Aftert that day, I flushed the stuff and went cold turkey
[01:09:53] <Cryowolf> on the beat
[01:10:05] <Cryowolf> then I stared working out
[01:10:14] <Cryowolf> and 1.5 years later, I got cancer
[01:10:30] <Cryowolf> now I haven't worked out in 1 year 2 months

[05:30:18] <flyke> MootPoot: Arch is very nice because it keeps a good compromise between being barebones and simple to maintain, imo (the pacman package is very simple).
[05:30:25] <ButterNoodle> I keep ~60 vm's up to date w it
[05:30:58] <ButterNoodle> yea pacman is arguably one of the best package managers
[05:31:18] <flyke> I find it more simple than debian apt.

[05:31:29] <flyke> agree

[09:05:15] <MootPoot> I do them but they're such a waste of time
[09:05:18] <senti> Hi butterboi
[09:05:37] <ButterNoodle> unfortunately its hard to test drive an employee for 30-60 days to see if ur cock fits properly
[09:06:00] <MootPoot> yeah but a remote test - they can just literally get somebody else to do it
[09:06:04] <senti> well, you've gotta make that 30-60 days count. pound that ass
[09:06:05] * ButterNoodle finger popps senti
[09:06:06] <MootPoot> not really a good metric either

[09:06:30] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Ignore companies that require ridiculous numbers of rounds and tests.
[09:06:39] <senti> don't finger pop your fellow coders, butter
[09:06:45] <ButterNoodle> y not
[09:06:50] <ButterNoodle> its consensual

[09:07:00] <MootPoot> dont want stinky code
[09:07:01] <Aurora_v_kosmose> They don't meaningfully increase your chances of getting in and greatly increase the amount of effort you make for no return.
[09:07:09] <ButterNoodle> gir fucked.. network gear doesnt segfault
[09:07:25] <Aurora_v_kosmose> ButterNoodle: We both wish.

[09:11:24] <senti> a bit of seasoning is always good
[09:11:34] <Aurora_v_kosmose> A box being open source doesn't make the problem any worse, and allows you to spend the effort to double-check updates if you want.

[10:55:57] <MootPoot> or maybe I haven't been looking in the right places
[10:56:13] <Aurora_v_kosmose> RSS is meant to serve as pull notification for slow moving things.
[10:56:21] <Aurora_v_kosmose> Instead of cluttering your mailbox.
[10:57:02] <Aurora_v_kosmose> It is also more privacy-friendly than sharing your mailbox whenever you want notifications. It's also more friendly on the content source, as it doesn't require them to also maintain a mailing list infrastructure.

[12:13:34] <MootPoot> are they working remote these days?
[12:14:12] <amigojapan> kariosfox: 32 bit has little power so not very well suited for video editing I think

[12:36:34] <MootPoot> well, at that point - unironically a Rpi4 woudl do better
[12:37:06] <MootPoot> kariosfox: but if that's the case I probably suggest just using a old copy of windows movie maker or something
[12:37:17] <MootPoot> I'm not sure how well stuff like shotcut or blender will scale to that level
[12:37:27] <Bco1981> am scheming on getting a pentium 233 working with a fairly current linux and go online with that.
[12:37:35] <S_T_A_N> Sometimes you have to just kill the old despite the fact that it's still used. They finally realized it for flash and 32bit should be dead. 
[12:37:38] <MootPoot> depending on what you want to do you might be better off doing it on a phone
[12:37:45] <S_T_A_N> Should be dead too

[13:32:56] <HubertFarnsworth> Sadale: why do you go for so much trouble? just install slackware and forget.

[13:34:08] <KatrinValerie> MootPoot: Arch is rolling garbage
[13:34:18] <KatrinValerie> No sane person would use it in production
[13:34:34] <Sadale> Back then I used debian-based distros. The main problem I had with that was that distro upgrade was a pain in the ass. And the packages are often outdated that it'd be difficult for me to install the latest version in case I need that. As for Arch, I always get the latest version at a cost of system stability.
[13:34:47] <MootPoot> I use windows server in production lmfao KatrinValerie 
[13:34:48] <HubertFarnsworth> KatrinValerie: arch users are masochists :p
[13:34:51] <Sadale> For desktop use, I find the cost of system stability being worth it.

[13:43:25] <KatrinValerie> I mean, always has been, you can still attempt long term investment, but if the government really cracks down on it you might not be able to cash out easily.
[13:43:25] <Sadale> If you've got some money in disposal, why not put some on crypto? But never invest what you can't lose.
[13:43:55] <Sadale> yeah the government here seems to be interested in cracking down on retail trading.
[13:44:13] <KatrinValerie> Sadale: it's important to space investments over time, that evens out the fluctuations a bit long term.

[13:45:06] <KatrinValerie> It is tough to set sensible stop loss orders
[13:45:07] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: ppp was my first way to connect to the internet on Linux
[13:45:21] <ketchupicecream> amigojapan: oh no, are the vtuber VAs known publicly?
[13:45:30] <KatrinValerie> Usually it's easier to just hold and ride things out
[13:45:34] <Sadale> Nah I'd never do stop loss.
[13:45:50] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: no. But the fans can find them
[13:45:57] <Sadale> I just assume that the market's growing over time with fluctuations.
[13:46:04] <HubertFarnsworth> damn amigojapan, that's almost ancient
[13:46:22] <KatrinValerie> Sadale: and if you spread your risk across enough markets, you usally end up with a net positive
[13:46:25] <amigojapan> Yup HubertFarnsworth 
[13:46:25] <ketchupicecream> amigojapan: dafuq
[13:46:31] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, yep :3
[13:46:31] <HubertFarnsworth> gtg now amigojapan, I've some work
[13:46:41] <amigojapan> ketchupicecream: not everyone is nice
[13:46:46] <ketchupicecream> cya HubertFarnsworth 
[13:46:51] <amigojapan> Btw HubertFarnsworth 
[13:46:53] <KatrinValerie> and if capitalism collapses, you will bite your arse for not spending the money when it was worth something.
[13:47:00] <KatrinValerie> Meow
[13:47:13] <ketchupicecream> KatrinValerie: lets collapse capitalism yay
[13:47:17] <MootPoot> LAME
[13:47:29] <KatrinValerie> ketchupicecream: not an easy task
[13:47:29] <MootPoot> Sadale: cancelled my order
[13:47:34] <Sadale> MootPoot, LOL
[13:47:36] <KatrinValerie> I mean, what would that even mean.
[13:47:41] <Sadale> MootPoot, why? xD
[13:47:47] <kariosfox> ketchupicecream: I heard him making a call in the corridor (I live in a block of flats) and went back for my phone, because I didn't have it with me, when I came back out i heard his footsteps going down, so I ran down after him. When I was out he was already in his van. I screamed for him to wait but he just drove away
[13:47:56] <KatrinValerie> hm
[13:48:08] <KatrinValerie> maybe replacing trading with voluntary pooling of resources
[13:48:08] <Sadale> MootPoot, impulse-purchasing? :P
[13:48:19] <MootPoot> Sadale: it didn't have unlimited video recording 
[13:48:20] <KatrinValerie> But idk how you get people on board with that
[13:48:26] <MootPoot> Only 30min max
[13:48:29] <Sadale> oh.
[13:48:33] <ketchupicecream> kariosfox: impatient due
[13:48:36] <ketchupicecream> dude*
[13:48:40] <KatrinValerie> You know, when everyone gets what they need, people get pissed about people who do not contribute as much as others.
[13:48:56] <KatrinValerie> It's nasty. The envy.
[13:48:58] <MootPoot> Seems like unless you get a camcorder you can't get unlimited video 
[13:49:01] <MootPoot> No matter what
[13:49:11] <Sadale> comrase ketchupicecream :3
[13:49:17] <Sadale> comrade ketchupicecream :3
[13:49:32] <KatrinValerie> Like, people litterally get angry about accomodations in the workplace for disabled people. Claiming it is favouriteism.
[13:49:36] <ketchupicecream> KatrinValerie: yo comrade
[13:50:00] <Sadale> I don't like capitalism as well. But it's, unfortunately here to stay. :( I just work around it. Hopefully I could save up enough money so that I'd stop having to worry about my livehood. I guess it's a kind of escape from capitalism.
[13:50:01] <ketchupicecream> KatrinValerie: probably a base income for everyone
[13:50:11] <ketchupicecream> and then work for luxuries?
[13:50:13] <JesseDesu> hmm
[13:50:24] <JesseDesu> i slept 22 hours
[13:50:25] <Sadale> MootPoot, Use your smartphone
[13:50:39] <KatrinValerie> ketchupicecream: I wish we would live in a society that could actually make the means of production available to everyone.
[13:50:40] <Sadale> MootPoot, Or camera with third party firmware.
[13:50:48] <KatrinValerie> Accessible education as well
[13:51:10] <fedorahead> they're trying to do single payer healthcare in california i think
[13:51:14] <Sadale> lulz education is a scam
[13:51:15] <KatrinValerie> Schools/Unis are so frigging ableist.
[13:51:27] <MootPoot> Sadale: phone has the same problem 
[13:51:29] <fedorahead> education is abso a scam
[13:51:32] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh really? :O
[13:51:34] <ketchupicecream> small changes take an eternity to be completed. 
[13:51:43] <Sadale> MootPoot, Even with a third party recording app?
[13:51:47] <ketchupicecream> drastic changes such as these won't ever happen
[13:51:48] <MootPoot> Seems like it's a software limit due to EU tax laws
[13:51:57] <KatrinValerie> This country puts folks with ASD in special ed by default, regardless of their abilities or interests.
[13:52:08] <KatrinValerie> It is very sad q.q
[13:52:14] <MootPoot> Anything recording more then 30min gets taxed as a video camera 
[13:52:14] <Sadale> Arguably tho third party recording app often doesn't perform as well as the official one.
[13:52:24] <MootPoot> Then they just made it global 
[13:52:24] <Sadale> MootPoot, oh wow. But you're outside EU

[13:53:01] <MootPoot> Camcorders have more tax
[13:53:11] <Sadale> Why separate tax for camera and video recorders?
[13:53:17] <JesseDesu> hey
[13:53:22] <fedorahead> katrin what country are youin
[13:53:25] <Sadale> MootPoot, anyway I still think that you could just use a third party app.
[13:53:28] <kariosfox> ketchupicecream: what should I do now? thing is this was supposed to be a replacement I was supposed to receive from a complaint  from an Ebay seller. I got a replacement screen for my phone  a couple of months ago after it broke, when it broke after 4 months. I talked with the seller, which gave a 12 month warranty on those, and  said theyd send the replacement through the delivery.

[13:55:03] <MootPoot> They fixed it in the OS but not in the system 
[13:55:08] <MootPoot> App I mean

[13:59:06] <JesseDesu> hi

[14:02:36] <Sadale> KatrinValerie, I, meanwhile is living with my parents to save up money for retirement xD
[14:02:39] <KatrinValerie> It is not a place you want to be in as an adult.
[14:02:55] <Sadale> I mean I could afford moving out. But I'd rather to tolerate living with my parents for now.
[14:02:56] <KatrinValerie> Sadale: eh, that's not dependence really
[14:03:02] <MootPoot> I guess the only real fix I have is using a webcam 
[14:03:05] <amigojapan> Bco1981: that's a common description of fish sperm sack

[14:03:32] <MootPoot> Sadale: I do have a logtich brio 
[14:03:33] <KatrinValerie> Sadale: it is perfectly valid not to move out if you keep the place in order and care for your parents as they grow older etc.

[14:03:50] <KatrinValerie> In the past it wasn't unusual for multiple generations to share living spaces
[14:04:02] <Bco1981> amigojapan: the problem is just the word sperm and creamy... sends naughty peoples mind in the gutter.
[14:04:04] <KatrinValerie> If you manage to get along it is also of mutual benefit.
[14:04:07] <Sadale> MootPoot, Dead simple. tiny SPI display, microSD slot, a few buttons, plus a USB slot. :P

[15:16:02] <JesseDesu> yea
[15:16:14] <JesseDesu> limit the disk space on it
[15:16:31] <mixfix41> you would have to do that in your partition scheme
[15:16:39] <mixfix41> or something like butterfs
[15:16:48] <JesseDesu> oh i thought it was simple
[15:16:55] <mixfix41> partitioning is simple though
[15:17:12] <JesseDesu> can i make the /home on a separate hdd
[15:17:16] <JesseDesu> an external one
[15:18:26] <mixfix41> its probs easier to do it on the same harddisk. if space is full then youd want to go that way

[15:19:00] <mixfix41> nexttime on another harddisk just leave yourself room and you can addd what whenever 
[15:19:40] <jessedesu2> I didn't anticipate this would be my main partition when I was distro hopping
[15:19:43] <mixfix41> i could see maybe you could do it within a file butterfs can 
[15:20:06] <mixfix41> but i havnt really done that except for using swap
[15:20:13] <mixfix41> its pretty neat bttrfs is worth learning it
[15:20:19] <jessedesu2> I want discord to run in a sandbox
[15:20:45] <jessedesu2> So if it freezes its only by itself
[15:20:47] <ketchupicecream> Flatpak?
[15:20:56] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: I gave you the instructions of how to do it
[15:20:57] <ketchupicecream> Although I don't know how effective that is
[15:21:00] <jessedesu2> What is flatpak
[15:21:07] <jessedesu2> Ok ty amigo
[15:21:14] <ketchupicecream> A kind of packaging for Linux apos
[15:21:27] <ketchupicecream> That restricts permissions
[15:21:30] <amigojapan> Yw
[15:22:03] <amigojapan> Disk quotas is the way to go
[15:22:10] <mixfix41> if you have the ram i would go and do a container no doubt
[15:22:58] <jessedesu2> Oh this looks complciated
[15:23:24] <jessedesu2> I don't want to mess with fstab
[15:23:26] <ketchupicecream> jessedesu2: Which one?
[15:23:32] <jessedesu2> What if I Bork it
[15:23:50] <amigojapan> Jesse back it up
[15:24:34] <jessedesu2> I have 2 sets of external hdds that mirror each other twice a day
[15:24:47] <mixfix41> no you its a one liner in fstab though if you dont do it correctly it wont mount on boot
[15:25:08] <jessedesu2> But I don't know how to backup and restore an OS partition 
[15:25:11] <mixfix41> see here on my laptop i have this line to add an unconventional bttrfs swap UUID=bccbe73e-5320-40e5-a8da-213919fcc1d6 /swap btrfs subvol=@swap 0 0

[15:33:46] <mixfix41> at least it lets you learn not to horde electronics ever again 8-D
[15:34:14] <ketchupicecream> Yeah. A desktop and a laptop would be the ideal choice
[15:35:53] <mixfix41> also think about if your skills are dependent from lot sales do you really want to still be at a certain skill level or why not and learn how computers network. embedding root file systems on _some_ exact hardware. besides this if you do embed filesystems through containers its all the same actually
[15:37:36] <mixfix41> i encouter threads where people are cross compiling a kernel and just forget to read the error line and their arent on a native toolchain

[15:42:19] <mixfix41> if you backup your partition you can manipulate it to see if you can resize the fs and keep everything running btw

[15:43:55] <mixfix41> it sometimes works out well. even ntfs packages has these to do it all with ntfs.fix

[15:47:46] <JesseDesu> am i getting mixed answers here
[15:47:49] <amigojapan> JesseDesu: I only recommend that if both computers have the same hardware. At install time drivers for the specific hardware are installed
[15:48:00] <JesseDesu> ahhhh ok
[15:48:11] <JesseDesu> its the same brand of hardware
[15:48:13] <JesseDesu> HP
[15:48:21] <JesseDesu> not close enough though right?
[15:48:27] <amigojapan> Same model?
[15:48:30] <mixfix41> in slackware, theres a kernel they call kernel-huge its the default kernel they ship with. it boots regardless of brands and hardware on the same architecture
[15:49:01] <ketchupicecream> Woah

[15:54:54] <JesseDesu> probably 250gb or so
[15:55:05] <mixfix41> the drive with the data has to be smaller than target drive 
[15:55:10] <mixfix41> usually
[15:55:25] <JesseDesu> i'm probably better off installing a fresh OS then trying to copy the setup from scratch
[15:55:30] <mixfix41> it can be vice versa but you then want to go to the filesystem fixes to get it in good order
[15:55:33] <JesseDesu> installing the same programs and such
[15:57:27] <mixfix41> you could the benefit to copying might not be there in a binary base distro anyway
[15:58:10] <mixfix41> and since lubuntu uses debian build system worth it to learn that too

[16:08:25] <mixfix41> which is something that appeals when i think about it 8-D
[16:09:16] <Bco1981> don't update, unless new apps won't work.

[16:18:54] <mixfix41> i think the choice is the thing we as consumers must demand do we want to be able to not and pick up later or now. its all about be able to on our hardware we own..

[17:41:22] <Bco1981> isekaijin: my son had issues with rocket leauge and fortnite after they updated. so i upgraded him to windows 10.
[17:41:35] <isekaijin> Oh.
[17:41:35] <Bco1981> both had problems at the same time.
[17:42:10] <Bco1981> i'm not sure if windows 7 updates would have resolved it.
[17:42:20] <isekaijin> Probably not.
[17:42:34] <Bco1981> he had only had sp1 as the only update to it. nothing after that.
[17:43:09] <Bco1981> my daughter had issues with getting discord installed. after windows 7 updates. now she can.
[17:43:28] <Bco1981> but she does not have fortnite or rocket league yet.
[17:44:51] <Bco1981> so can't be sure if they would work on a updated windows 7... which actually still gets updates...
[17:45:01] <Bco1981> even thou... it shouldn't
[17:46:01] <isekaijin> It's probably only getting security updates, and only for super egregious issues.

[17:57:51] <name100`> not too expensive i don't know much about it but i used linux before
[17:57:59] <Bco1981> what ever you get, don't get the latest cpu/gpu models. and don't get nvidia.
[17:58:03] <name100`> i heard about a pinebook but it sold out out of stock
[17:58:17] <name100`> thinkpenguin has some
[17:58:19] <name100`> but so expensive
[17:58:31] <Sadale> I'd mainly consider the screen size, screen resolution, RAM, storage (HDD/SSD), and of course, price!
[17:58:47] <name100`> ok
[17:59:40] <isekaijin> I wonder if a MacBook would be a good investment. It really depends on how much time it will elapse until it becomes useless.
[18:00:26] <isekaijin> If it lasts 10 years, then it's a good investment. If it lasts 3 years, then not so much.
[18:00:32] <Sadale> pine64 is inexpensive. But I'm not sure if it'd be a nice laptop to have.
[18:00:39] <Sadale> I mean the 11.6" pinebook
[18:00:53] <ButterNoodle> 11.6" u should do porno
[18:01:00] <Bco1981> isn't pinebook just a rpi premade "laptop" ?
[18:01:12] <Sadale> I think not. pine doesn't have much to do with rpi
[18:01:42] <isekaijin> Oh, the Pinebook is ARM-powered. So it could natively run Android games?
[18:01:49] <Sadale> name100`, What's your budget tho? :o

[18:11:42] <Sadale> Actually I've no idea on how to work with smart pointers in C++. I used to know how to work with that. But I've never put it into use so now that I've forgot that \o/
[18:12:05] <Sadale> Other than that I can use pointers fine tho. :P
[18:12:22] <isekaijin> C++ is complicated for other reasons, but you could always just use C.
[18:12:27] <isekaijin> C is not that complicated.
[18:12:34] <isekaijin> Sure, it has its gotchas.
[18:12:36] <Sadale> agreed. C is simple.
[18:12:54] <Sadale> C may not be easy. But the language itself's simple.

[18:14:03] <isekaijin> Even then, the problem isn't even the languages... the problem is the constant need to reinvent the universe from scratch.
[18:14:22] <Sadale> What did you mean?
[18:14:50] <isekaijin> WinForms, then WPF, then WinRT or whatever the newfangled thing is that came with Windows 8...
[18:15:15] <Sadale> oh. lol

[23:20:20] <Bco1981> the "default" gateway, is that in the 10.42.0.2 - 10.42.0.254 range ?
[23:20:20] <JesseDesu> destination is 10.42.0.0 for enp3s0 and 192.168.76.0 for usb0

[23:22:40] <Bco1981> ah, it sees default gateway through the usb
[23:23:15] <JesseDesu> usb0 appears twice
[23:24:18] <Bco1981> yeah, that's two different routes
[23:24:22] <JesseDesu> i mean, the usb works but its a little slow
[23:24:25] <Bco1981> using the usb interface
[23:24:31] <JesseDesu> preferabbly i want the wired connection
[23:24:57] <Bco1981> it looks like there was not default route for the wired connection.
[23:24:58] <JesseDesu> my phone wasnt meant to be a network card 
[23:25:15] <Bco1981> it looks like there was no default route for the wired connection.

[23:28:27] <Bco1981> the line with 192.168.64.0 is just to set the network mask to 255.255.255.0 mening. This net can only speak to devices in 192.168.64.(0-255)
[23:28:34] <JesseDesu> if i disconnect the usb0 tether it just says destination 10.42.0.0
[23:29:20] <Bco1981> inorder to communicate with anything outside of 192.168.64.(0-255), it has to use the default gateway, which in this case is 192.168.64.1.
[23:29:33] <Bco1981> yeah, the wired connection is missing a default route
[23:29:46] <Bco1981> you have to know the lan ip of your router
[23:29:49] <JesseDesu> how to fix
[23:29:55] <MootPoot> did he bork his router

[23:30:51] <Bco1981> JesseDesu: if the router is not in the 10.42.0.(0-255) range. you have to change the ip of this laptop.
[23:31:04] <JesseDesu> its 192.168.4.1
[23:31:07] <Bco1981> otherwise, it will not be able to communicate with it,.
[23:31:36] <JesseDesu> how do i do this
[23:31:43] <Bco1981> so the laptop has to have a ip called 192.168.4.(2-254) for it to communicate with that.
[23:32:09] <JesseDesu> i see
[23:32:12] <Bco1981> lubuntu should have some gui to change that.
[23:33:40] <Bco1981> prefferably, you select dhcp for the wired connection, and that should work.
[23:35:05] <JesseDesu> think ubuntu does but not lubuntu
[23:35:12] <JesseDesu> i'll try it the terminal way
[23:36:02] <JesseDesu> or this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccBgbiju_DM

[23:38:12] <JesseDesu> ugh what a shitty video
[23:38:45] <Bco1981> yeah, he types in the gateway address in the netmask field... and forgets to put in dns servers.
[23:40:25] <JesseDesu> what is the difference between the address and the netmask
[23:40:35] <JesseDesu> should the netmask be different by +1
[23:41:27] <Bco1981> no, netmask is usually, 255.0.0.0, 255.255.0.0 or 255.255.255.0
[23:41:36] <Bco1981> very very basic
[23:42:13] <JesseDesu> i'm using 192.168.4.2 for the address
[23:42:44] <JesseDesu> what should the netmask be in that case
[23:43:40] <Bco1981> it would say so on your router, what it uses. most likely 255.255.255.0

[23:47:53] <Jigsy> I've been the same for a while.
[23:47:56] <Jigsy> I think it's stress related.
[23:48:39] <ezekielnoob> Jigsy i see
[23:48:41] <ezekielnoob> hmm
[23:48:49] <ezekielnoob> i didn't know it's quite common tho
[23:49:08] <Jigsy> I actually meant to wash my hair today and completely forgot.
[23:49:13] <ezekielnoob> it ends up messing with my desk
[23:49:33] <ezekielnoob> you just wash your hair other than just showering ?
[23:49:45] <Bco1981> JesseDesu: on the wan, it's probably automatic yes. but the lan ip on the router has to have a netmask, and it can't be automatic.
[23:49:46] <Jigsy> What do you mean?
[23:50:23] <ezekielnoob> i mean i assume if u shower that u already wash your hair
[23:50:44] <ezekielnoob> i don't got lice tho

[23:53:57] <Jigsy> Washing your hair daily is dumb.
[23:54:03] <Jigsy> It's also not good for your hair.

[23:54:46] <MootPoot> also, you didnt answer the question Jigsy
