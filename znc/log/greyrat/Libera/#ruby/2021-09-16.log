[21:09:29] <rapha> huh
[21:09:30] <rapha> wow
[21:09:43] <rapha> the code generator employed by bundler's gem generator is quite dangerous
[21:10:27] <rapha> it uses an example URL which leads to a very obnoxious looking website (https://mygemserver.com <=== only click on that with appropriate security measures taken i'd say)
[21:11:11] <leah2> i guess someone sniped that domain?
[21:17:11] <nakilon> I ALWAYS SAID that generating gem with that thing is a bad practice
[21:18:37] * rapha is trying for the first time to see what it actually does
[21:18:43] <nakilon> it says "domain is for sale" though so you can buy it and host a webpage with <H1>don't generate gems with bundler!!!!</H1>
[21:18:57] <nakilon> just build the gem manually
[21:19:01] <nakilon> it's not rails
[21:19:12] <rapha> hhhh bcoz that works so well ... buying domains from domain snipers like that one
[21:19:22] <nakilon> minimal gem is just 1 file I suppose
[21:21:17] <nakilon> they are "domain investors since 1997" and have whole lot of 860 followers in instagram, why don't you trust them ..D
[21:21:28] <rapha> this is on the top of the list when you google "how to make a ruby gem" ... just sayin', people might follow their guide, you know.
[21:21:49] <rapha> since 1997?! wow! that's almost as good as since 1887!
[21:22:03] <nakilon> there should be some normal guide, all those suck, even the one on rubygems.org
[21:23:03] <leah2> just copy the gemspec from your last gem :p
[21:23:08] <rapha> fwiw it took me 5 minutes and now i have a gem with all the bells and whistles i could wish for in a gem
[21:23:18] <nakilon> there should be one that says "build it file by file" and especially "don't push it to rubygems god damn just because you want to see what will be the output print of the command"
[21:24:22] <nakilon> and 3: "you don't have to push your gem to rubygems, bundler easily takes gems right from your git repo"
[21:25:28] <nakilon> "i have a gem" -- no, you have nothing ..D it has empty ./lib, does nothing, but has squatted some name on rubygems and will be there forever

[21:26:18] <rapha> hihihihi
[21:26:24] <rapha> seems i hit a raw spot there, dear nakilon 
[21:26:30] <nakilon> (I'm just frustrated by moments when I come up with some nice idea, want to name a gem and all the forms of the name are already taken by gems v0.0.1 with 1 commit "first commit")
[21:26:31] * rapha hands nakilon a bottle of vodka
[21:26:56] <leah2> 4, just use a submodules instead of gems :p
[21:27:03] <nakilon> and for example that gem bmp that has no relation to bmp...
[21:29:33] <nakilon> do you know the Java blogger Egor Bugayenko? he's kind of the "expert in OOP" and stuff, makes some weird radical blog posts about how to code in Java
[21:31:24] <rapha> i was out at "java" and "blogger" ;)
[21:32:27] <nakilon> our local rails companies are doing "Rubyconf" annually though no one has neither a clue nor interest in Ruby in Russia -- they only know and want Rails because it sounds better than PHP and making websites is the only IT job we are doing in Russia

[21:33:48] <nakilon> so the conference name pretends to be about Ruby but in fact it's about Rails and trying to hire people in those 2-3 old companies that are doing this every year; and this year looks like they don't even have enough speakers so can you imagine they've invited that Java blogger
[21:35:22] <nakilon> can you imagine, he will tell how to write in ruby, and probably since he has no idea what it is his topic will be "How to make a gem", like it's some sort of a secret and no one could figure it out until now when the Java blogger will tell us with slides

[23:28:20] <AMPed> I'm having a really hard time fitting rdoc and ri into my head; I had perhaps naÃ¯vely thought they would be something like man pages or (going back) perldoc, but it seems like I need to know more about the file location where modules and classes are defined.

[23:35:36] <AMPed> aha
[23:35:56] <AMPed> and no, nothing in the top two.
[23:37:13] <AMPed> right... rvm makes things easier... :\
[23:37:49] <adam12> :P
[23:40:16] <adam12> Documentation in Ruby has always been lackluster. Maybe that will be changing soon.
[23:40:31] <adam12> At one point, `--no-ri --no-rdoc` were suggested gem install options :(
[23:40:58] <adam12> IRB is starting to include tab-completion and alt-d document support. Maybe that's a turning point.
[23:41:04] <weaksauce> yeah i was reading the docs on eventmachine today... and well that's not very well documented at all
[23:42:06] <AMPed> one of those things you don't realize the importance of until it's gone, or in this case, wasn't there in the first place
[23:42:25] <AMPed> Note to self: document your own crap, thoroughly.
[23:43:57] <adam12> There's definitely been work on improving core docs. Burdette Lamar submits like 10 PR's a week to improve docs. And I saw some doxygen stuff for the C bits.
[23:44:17] <adam12> But I do wish gem docs were built into the deployment process, similar to Hex from Elixir (hexdocs.pm).
[23:45:37] <adam12> An advantage that Jose had when creating a new language. Deciding on docs up front (markdown, testable) makes it easy to encourage people. Similar to Rails and testing so many years ago.
[23:48:15] <adam12> weaksauce: I just added eventmachine to gemdocs.org.  57.76% documented. Heh.
