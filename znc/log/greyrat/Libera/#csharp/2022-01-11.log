[00:46:01] <ki9a> MatthiasVance: wasm lacks two things generally used by any debugger
[00:46:09] <ki9a> any gc*
[00:46:14] <ki9a> Threading and stack scanning
[00:46:22] <ki9a> neither is properly supported by wasm
[00:47:30] <ki9a> some browsers support webworkers on shared memory in wasm in some conditions (which could be a form of threading)
[00:47:35] <ki9a> but the stack cannot be scanned at all
[00:50:20] <MatthiasVance> Oh :o
[00:50:42] <MatthiasVance> Do you know how .NET does it?

[01:00:49] <ki9a> Not sure how it does it exactly though
[01:01:09] <Diablo-D3> mono compiles to, and executes, cil.
[01:01:26] <Suchiman> mono does have a LLVM based AOT compiler nowadays for CIL WASM
[01:01:38] <Diablo-D3> blazor is a thing microsoft wrote that does interesting things with c#.
[01:01:41] <Diablo-D3> Suchiman: it does have it

[01:01:48] <Diablo-D3> its weird, lets say that.

[01:02:07] <Diablo-D3> it'd take me three pages to say why.
[01:02:12] <ki9a> Suchiman: interesting; so it compiles to "native wasm" ?

[01:06:12] <ki9a> virtual registers become wasm locals
[01:06:26] <ki9a> while allocas are put in a special block of memory in wasm that's treated as the stack

[01:07:19] <Suchiman> ki9a: mhm
[01:07:42] <Suchiman> ki9a: i'm not sure how mono wasm does it, CoreRT wasm explicitly puts gc refs on a shadowstack
[01:07:54] <ki9a> essentially what I do then
[01:09:01] <ezio> Is there a way, in .Net Framework ASP to proxy pass an entire /foo to another application running on a different server?
[01:09:12] <ki9a> .net core?
[01:09:15] <Suchiman> they should have just used CIL instead of inventing WASM :P
[01:09:23] <Suchiman> it's more efficient / compressible / compact xD
[01:09:23] <MatthiasVance> One guy ... several computers .. dealing with swarms of WASMs all by himself ... but he has the power of the shadow stack. Coming this summer .. ki9a!
[01:09:41] <ki9a> Suchiman: it's also not as safe
[01:09:47] <ki9a> MatthiasVance: heh
[01:10:10] <Suchiman> ki9a: i mean it used to have the safe subset and such
[01:10:18] <ki9a> ezio: If  you use core: https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/
[01:10:29] <ki9a> Suchiman: yeah but it still had some holes
[01:10:30] <ezio> no .Net Framework
[01:10:35] <ki9a> not bugs per se
[01:11:05] <Suchiman> ki9a: you mean like OS calls?
[01:11:14] <ki9a> but the way .net cil is setup, it has a lot of places that could hold security bugs
[01:11:29] <ki9a> (don't have to, might)
[01:12:12] <MatthiasVance> In return you get no debugger
[01:12:13] <MatthiasVance> :P
[01:12:24] <ki9a> to implement wasm, the only security thing you have to do is: Guard SOs and guard the memory range access
[01:12:33] <ki9a> MatthiasVance: on wasm?
[01:13:02] <MatthiasVance> I was thinking yes but that's not true (anymore) is it
[01:13:04] <MatthiasVance> Time to zzzz
[01:13:15] <ki9a> MatthiasVance: we had a debugger on wasm for several years now
[01:13:45] <MatthiasVance> I've never been in contact with "pure" wasm, just through Blazor and it was lacking
[01:13:54] <ki9a> it's quite tricky
[01:14:16] <ki9a> we use dwarf debug info (But rename the tables because else Chrome tries to get too smart)
[01:15:28] <ki9a> so i do some tricky stuff to first get the debug info from the wasm file
[01:15:40] <ki9a> and even trickier to inspect locals
[01:15:43] <ki9a> :)
[01:16:24] <ki9a> Suchiman: iirc the wasm spec even defines the places that you have to secure it at
[01:16:50] <Suchiman> ki9a: and yet there were a lot of security issues in the early days IIRC xD
[01:17:12] <ki9a> you mean the threading related stuff?
[01:17:30] <Suchiman> ki9a: no the implementation of the wasm VM
[01:17:52] <Suchiman> that it spawned a few people saying "wasm is gonna ruin our security!!!!"
[01:18:09] <ki9a> pff
[01:18:27] <ki9a> wasm really has very few "holes"
[01:19:01] <ki9a> there's a few tables, like memory (indexed by byte), locals (by index), args (same idea) and tables (for accessing external/internal things)
[01:19:08] <Suchiman> ki9a: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=wasm
[01:19:09] <ki9a> those have to be checked
[01:20:16] <ki9a> Suchiman: not that bad?

[13:07:45] <Nasp> Brett[Air]:  Some stuff like fire and forget
[13:07:54] <Nasp> But async void can just crash the application
[13:07:55] <Tobbi_> Yes
[13:08:16] <Nasp> Just disallow async void and have some TaskHelper.FireAndForget metho
[13:08:19] <Nasp> That makes the intend more clear
[13:08:52] <Brett[Air]> they are also handled differently, async void would only be used for an event handler in my experience

[13:54:05] <biberu> tsujp: you can use something like Task<Option<T>> or Task<Either<L,R>>, to either let the absence of a value indicate an error, or return the error as if it was any other result, without throwing, and that will compose

[14:28:29] <tsujp> I really struggle to think about things the OOP way
[14:28:45] <tsujp> Find myself getting angry often, seems so backwards
[14:29:05] <biberu> this isn't oop
[14:29:13] <biberu> option types are common in fp
[14:29:30] <tsujp> I know, but I mean unless I add that I need to do it the OOP way which is.. you can't?
[14:29:40] <tsujp> Like, is OOP just wrapping literally everything in `try {} catch {}`?
[14:29:57] <tsujp> "there are some drawbacks: it requires the caller to do null checking, it doesn't compose, and if it also returned a value the caller would probably have to remember (or care to) check for errors properly"
[14:30:06] <tsujp> I don't understand why the caller having to do these things is bad
[14:30:07] <biberu> i don't think "oop" has any opinion on that

[14:45:45] <MaNa3k> so how can i make a chunk of a list<myObj> base of of year ?
[14:50:59] <biberu> MaNa3k?
[14:51:36] <MaNa3k> list<myObj>  => list<list<myObj>>
[14:51:55] <MaNa3k> each list<myObjc> will be grouped by year
[14:52:43] <biberu> list.GroupBy(v => v.Year).Select(g => g.ToList()).ToList() // List<List<T>>
[14:53:05] <MaNa3k> biberu, the year is actually in a string
[14:53:13] <MaNa3k> i guess i can parse that date myselft
[14:53:18] <MaNa3k> anyway, didnt want to use groupby though
[14:53:31] <biberu> you want to group by without using groupby?
[14:53:36] <biberu> :)
[14:53:38] <MaNa3k> and also forgot to tell, each group must not have more then 100 items
[14:54:14] <biberu> combine with .Chunk()
[14:54:21] <MaNa3k> [2020 list(100), 2019 list(100), 2022 list(100)]
[14:54:28] <MaNa3k> biberu, ah i see
[14:54:57] <MaNa3k> better sample [2020 list(100), 2020 list(31), 2019 list(100), 2022 list(13)]
[14:55:29] <MaNa3k> biberu, thanks, i think i got it now
[14:56:42] <biberu> e.g. .SelectMany(g => g.Chunk(100)) instead of .Select in the example above
[14:59:10] <MaNa3k> biberu, theres actually one more complexity i maybe shuold have started off with, its actually a list that is joined with another. but i think i will manage it. thanks
[14:59:49] <biberu> a.Concat(b).GroupBy(year).SelectMany(g => g.Chunk(100))
[15:01:04] <MaNa3k> biberu, not that kind of a join. more like a left outer join

[18:12:10] <tsujp> Suchiman yeah .NET Core 6
[18:12:13] <tsujp> will give groupby a shot
[18:12:28] <Suchiman> tsujp: second.Concat(first).DistinctBy(x => x.Name)
[18:12:58] <tsujp> that DistinctBy selects over `second` right?
[18:13:04] <Suchiman> no over both
[18:13:34] <tsujp> Oh right so that is concatting first into second where first is distinct
[18:13:41] <Suchiman> second.Concat(first) makes the elements from second appear first in the sequence followed by first and DistinctBy discards all elements that have been previously seen by that predicate of Name
[18:13:56] <tsujp> Ah right derp
[18:17:11] <tsujp> do you guys like my little KeyValuePair string construction https://pastebin.com/raw/3NnEuHwN
[18:17:46] <tsujp> it constructs a string with the key name and item count separated by commas to return a ValidationProblem ActionResult if an API request contains multiple definitions of the same named thing
[18:18:00] <tsujp> The dictionary contains the duplicates, this makes the pretty string
[18:18:45] <Suchiman> tsujp: string details = String.Join(", ", distinctNamesAndCounts.Select(x => $"rule '{src.Key}' specified {src.Value} times"));
[18:18:59] <Suchiman> is more efficient
[18:19:31] <tsujp> Awww man :'(
[18:19:34] <tsujp> ok ill use that
[18:21:16] <tsujp> Oh I was using `string.Join` earlier (lowercase `s`) which it really didn't like
[18:21:41] <tsujp> Holdup that makes no difference.. huh
[18:21:43] <Suchiman> `String.Join` and `string.Join` should make zero dfiference
[18:21:49] <tsujp> Yeah.. ignore me
[18:21:52] <tsujp> Flailing around as usual
[18:24:04] <xb0o2> It may not be particularly poignant if your code is just being used in the context of validating an API request but you just want to be mindful of the number of unnecessary string operations you're doing because of the allocations required
[18:25:09] <xb0o2> Not only is string.Join much more obvious in intention to a reader but it also uses StringBuilders under the hood

[18:31:48] <jonp> `string` is an alias to `System.String`. They're the same type.
[18:32:06] <jonp> and if you want memory efficiency, string.Join() + .Select() isn't the way to do it
[18:32:12] <jonp> you'd want a manual StringBuilder + foreach loop
[18:32:27] <tsujp> Isn't a given that anything LINQ isn't efficient
[18:32:30] <tsujp> AFAIK
[18:32:36] <jonp> generally, yeah
[18:32:45] <jonp> string.Join() isn't LINQâ€¦
[18:33:17] <tsujp> I know but the .Select() is
[18:36:06] <tsujp> Okay another Q for you friends. I've got an EF entity which has a `List<Foo> rules` on it and from the aforementioned I now have a list of distinct rules `List<Foo> newRules` in my method. What I am thinking of doing is: Any rules on this EF entity's `rules` property that have the same name as a rule in `newRules` are `.Update()`ed and any that do
[18:36:07] <tsujp> not have the same name (but are present in newRules) are added as they are new rules, but any that don't have the same name and are NOT present in newRules are deleted as they are no longer needed
[18:36:54] <MatthiasVance> ðŸ¤¯
[18:36:55] <tsujp> I think doing all that is clunky compared to doing `.Delete()` on all the Foo entities in that EF objects `.rules` property and simply `.Add()` newRules in
[18:37:00] <edcba> Has EF got a Merge method ?
[18:37:04] <tsujp> That's 2 passes vs that clusterfuck from before
[18:37:26] <tsujp> Not that I can see
[18:38:23] <tsujp> IntersectBy might be a good one here
[18:38:36] <tsujp> But how can you do the "make the new list only these" thing as one method call?

[18:39:53] <edcba> knowing MERGE instruction will necessarily help you at some time

[18:41:08] <tsujp> Not but I could make them a PK

[18:41:33] <tsujp> Their UUID Id and their STRING Name
[18:41:45] <edcba> lol
[18:41:45] <MatthiasVance> So you have 2 collections
[18:41:48] <tsujp> Right now the only PK is their UUID Id column
[18:41:53] <MatthiasVance> That all have entities with ids?
[18:41:57] <tsujp> Look it's nasty I know but that's all I can do here
[18:42:11] <MatthiasVance> Does one collection have entities with ids?
[18:42:34] <tsujp> Yes the `rules` collection on my EF object is a `List<Foo>` and Foo has a property Id
[18:42:53] <MatthiasVance> Okay so you can just group on name, then take the ones with Id if there are any
[18:42:57] <MatthiasVance> And then save everything?
[18:43:15] <edcba> something is wrong imo
[18:43:28] <tsujp> That doesn't delete ones that don't match though, no? Like I am fine doing it in two passes like that but I'd prefer not to?
[18:43:37] <tsujp> Perhaps if I explain the problem more verbosely in a paste?
[18:44:37] <MatthiasVance> I know what you want to achieve but it's hard to talk code without code
[18:44:42] <edcba> can't you do some var e = new EFEntity(mypk); e.Deleted = true; ? I don't know EF but i guess it's possible
[18:45:01] <MatthiasVance> So maybe you can set up a minimal in-memory example on something where we can run it? :D
[18:45:23] <edcba> basically have some collection of entities that are either updated or deleted and save all at same time
[18:53:12] <tsujp> here's a pastebin link with real code (not a complete example) because a complete example would take me an hour or two to setup and it's 11:23 pm here: https://pastebin.com/embed_iframe/ZWjPUPxW

[22:18:51] <MichaelLong> does one need to know this game?
[22:20:34] <MaNa2k> i wouldnt bother
[22:21:49] <MaNa2k> by the looks of the trailers, its a mech\middleage style theme with open world
[22:23:03] <MaNa2k> assassins creed style, but much better graphics and more vibrant

[23:14:30] <lz_> one crazy, crazy, crazy thing is when python packages compile the whole earth, fail for some dumb reasons then delete everything. you install the missing package, try to install the python package and it builds everything again

[23:44:29] <MaNa2k> lz_, why is it giving you errors
[23:44:53] *** Joins: jamea (~jamea@177.239.81.39)
[23:44:57] <MaNa2k> i find restarting vs somethings help when rebuilds fail
[23:45:10] <lz_> MaNa2k: one of the time it failed was because i didn't have "cmake" installed :) but now I've went and looked for all the dependencies before trying to install it again, should be the last time
[23:45:38] <MaNa2k> mhm, cmake? are you doing c++ ?
[23:45:54] <lz_> im just installing some python packages that try to build themselves
[23:45:59] <lz_> fuckkkkkk it failed again
[23:46:01] <lz_> kill me already
[23:46:17] <MaNa2k> lol
[23:46:32] <MaNa2k> hmm, no clue about python
[23:47:18] <lz_> so there was this girl I've sold some stuff to a few months ago
[23:48:06] <lz_> nvm
[23:48:36] <lz_> I'm still 12yo in my wrecked head

[23:53:25] <lz_> I'm a fucking mess and no one would ever want to put up with my shit
[23:53:38] <teegee> not with that attitude
