[00:04:23] <sm> Saba is really "avoiding" being contacted 
[00:04:34] <sm> woo! another!
[00:07:15] <sm> the recommendation of haskell platform is a little mysterious, many say it no longer exists
[00:16:24] <sm> a working stack.yaml:... (full message at https://libera.ems.host/_matrix/media/r0/download/libera.chat/ed929735b2c7471a865691ba2b1c6b799886b966)
[00:17:23] <sm> aside: I tire of waiting an age for aeson to build. It's just.. JSON! And I.. am never using it!
[00:19:16] <sm> I think using vi movement keys, in a non-vi layout, is a mistake
[00:19:46] <sm> (though, having the layout onscreen definitely helps)
[00:20:58] <sm> collision detection seems off by one sometimes - it stops me one square away from the forest edge
[00:22:24] <sm> AAAA! I die.
[00:23:34] <sm> is it intended that pressing once makes it keep moving until an obstacle ?
[00:26:02] <sm> three languages fully supported out of the box - you don't see that often. Awesome!
[00:26:03] <f-a> danke for the stack thingo
[00:27:34] <f-a> those are not vi movements tho :P
[00:27:44] <f-a> mhhh forest is meant to be impassable, I will check htis
[00:27:57] <f-a> pressing once should make you move *one tile*
[00:28:06] <sm> not here..
[00:28:07] <f-a> (tiles being a bit rough on the edges as now)
[00:28:15] <f-a> not one character, miind you
[00:28:26] <f-a> a tile is 5√ó3 chars in dimensions 
[00:29:09] <sm> ?!
[00:29:55] <sm> I see....
[00:30:25] <sm> there's not enough space yet to observe that, it felt like I was just moving till collision
[00:30:28] <f-a> but apparently people do not like it that much, are confused! So I might change it
[00:30:41] <f-a> do you see ¬´new¬ª tiles getting uncovered?
[00:30:59] <f-a> (I am noting down all the feedback)
[00:31:09] <sm> ok I see it now after opening the gate
[00:31:30] <sm> yes
[00:31:46] <sm> nifty
[00:31:59] <sm> I think it reveals neighbouring tiles ? not full line of sight ?
[00:32:06] <f-a> neighbour
[00:32:19] <f-a> 8 tiles around where you are
[00:33:16] <f-a> re: languages, shakespeare and its i18n module are quite nifty
[00:33:35] <sm> oh, you're using that, great
[00:33:48] <f-a> I wrote it in Italian and used gtranslate for the other two, it could be automated and sent to reviewers
[00:34:34] <sm> super! I didn't notice the english was auto translated
[00:34:57] <sm> in fact I think it can't be... ?
[00:35:08] <f-a> there are some hints that is it
[00:35:14] <sm> oh wait.. "you beat the key", yes :)
[00:35:18] <f-a> ¬´ti batti la chiave¬ª is slang for ¬´you po- yeah
[00:35:47] <sm> it could be totally fine, adds to the charm. If it makes you efficient
[00:36:00] <sm> love it
[00:36:07] <f-a> I wonder if ¬´¬ª are used at all in English?
[00:36:18] <sm> no, I don't think so
[00:36:24] <f-a> thanks
[00:36:39] <f-a> in any case, this is a proof of concept
[00:36:46] <f-a> I will tweak it until people are comfortable
[00:37:38] <sm> congrats! this is I guess the first top-down action adventure with a-t-g!
[00:38:08] <sm> is there a lot different from venzone, implementation wise ?
[00:38:36] <f-a> yes, venzone should have used ECS, but I was not aware and reimplemented a bastardised version myself
[00:38:51] <f-a> this one is standard state + a map
[00:39:17] <f-a> I have an idea in mind for an adventure, once I am happy with the ¬´engine¬ª I will write it
[00:40:51] <f-a> if I can I will refactor it to have a smaller footprint (i.e. no microlens)
[00:41:32] <ManofLetters[m]> I don't use any lens and I live
[00:42:04] <icrbow[m]> lens are a good fit for ECS systems
[00:42:05] <f-a> yeah after checking what you do I am convinced a flat state is not bad at all
[00:42:20] <f-a> you can use a typeclass to restrict what you are accessing
[00:42:31] <f-a> icrbow[m]: indeed indeed, venzone would have been more painful w/o microlenses
[00:42:51] <icrbow[m]> `global $~ lensyFieldOfSomeRandoComponent %~ succ`
[00:43:32] <f-a> what I hate is staging restrictions etc
[00:43:55] <icrbow[m]> systems even take most of the pain of traversals:`cmap $ this .~ True`
[00:44:50] <f-a> icrbow[m]: ManofLetters[m]: when/if you can, tell me if my proof-of-concept works on your machines too!
[00:44:57] <f-a> still sad I cannot use more modern ghcs
[00:45:11] <f-a> I could have tested unicode input on Windows‚Ä¶ but they segfault
[00:45:46] <ManofLetters[m]> which GHC do you want it tested on my ancient Ubuntu? also, set up CIs to test on Windows and others for your
[00:46:31] *** Quits: aliosablack (~chomwitt@2a02:587:dc0f:7c00:12c3:7bff:fe6d:d374) (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
[00:46:48] <ManofLetters[m]> though it won't test a physical keyboard
[00:47:14] <f-a> how do you give instructions to your machine?
[00:47:20] <sm> why can't you use modern GHCs ?
[00:48:08] <f-a> https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20445 sm 
[00:48:42] <f-a> it seems technology is getting more complex, too much to manage it
[00:48:50] <sm> argh!
[00:48:54] <ManofLetters[m]> f-a: I have AI opponents and I just make one of the play as a human; but once I also just did `echo "manyCommands" > gameBinary` and checked CI output
[00:49:07] <f-a> (not GHC, in general. Would we be able to build a PC from scratch in case of a societal collapse?)
[00:49:21] <f-a> super
[00:50:01] <f-a> my ghc is 8.8.4, any other will do (or even the same, never trust claims of x-compatibility)
[00:50:03] <ManofLetters[m]> s/the/them/, s/a//, s/>/|/
[00:50:45] <ManofLetters[m]> ok, will test 8.10.7; with 9.2.1 and -allow-newer my game crashes
[00:51:29] <f-a> isn‚Äôt that ironic that we are so advanced in CompSci as human race but these scaffolding problems still are thorny
[00:52:14] <ManofLetters[m]> we always generate plenty of chaos, regardless of advancement
[00:53:11] <f-a> that should make a great theme for a short story
[00:57:19] <sm> looks like Gamari and Stecklina are on the case üëçÔ∏è
[00:57:43] <f-a> yeah they were quick to help
[00:57:50] <f-a> I wonder if I should clone the repo and bisect
[00:57:58] <ManofLetters[m]> compiles and plays great
[00:58:01] <ManofLetters[m]> did you say it's action?
[00:58:07] <ManofLetters[m]> it seems turn-based
[00:58:17] <f-a> it is an adventure, but will have action minigames
[00:58:24] <f-a> to keep player engaged
[00:58:35] <ManofLetters[m]> the only confusion I have is I didn't know to press Space to clear the messages
[00:58:43] <f-a> thanks!
[00:58:49] <ManofLetters[m]> oh, so it's like an RPG with action minigames?
[00:58:56] <f-a> useful feedback
[00:58:59] <f-a> yes, that is the idea
[00:59:12] <ManofLetters[m]> I won
[00:59:13] <ManofLetters[m]> \o/
[00:59:33] <ManofLetters[m]> the win message is printed over previous message which peeks from under it
[00:59:41] * sm guessed "any key", & just discovered ESC also works
[00:59:43] <f-a> yes, is that bad?
[00:59:48] <ManofLetters[m]> but space clears it and q exits fine
[01:00:03] <ManofLetters[m]> not bad
[01:00:14] <sm> possibly a little on-screen hint would be good
[01:00:21] <f-a> will add it!
[01:00:27] <ManofLetters[m]> but it makes me ask "what's there underneat? oh, it's the old message"
[01:00:40] <ManofLetters[m]> and there are probably more fun things to think during the game than that
[01:00:46] * f-a ndos
[01:00:47] <sm> or not.. I guess you get the hang of it. Just continuing on with normal game keypresses gets rid of it
[01:00:49] <f-a> *nods
[01:01:29] <ManofLetters[m]> yes, I was just stressed that I was pressing direction keys intially instead of space and then worried if I perhaps moved double due to that and should go back, etc.
[01:01:33] <sm> for perfection: show the hint on the first one only
[01:01:35] <ManofLetters[m]> again spurious thoughts
[01:01:46] <ManofLetters[m]> yep, first is enough
[01:01:51] <f-a> super suggestion sm 
[01:01:54] <f-a> very cosy 
[01:02:17] <sm> my fingers will never adapt to these uncanny valley not-vi keys :)
[01:03:11] <f-a> if I finally can get down what ‚Üë‚Üì‚Üí‚Üê are on many platforms‚Ä¶
[01:03:14] <ManofLetters[m]> I like the game, definitely intrigued me; but I'm not a typical player, I don't have proper player habits and assumptions
[01:03:38] <ManofLetters[m]> you can get some definitions from me
[01:03:43] <ManofLetters[m]> surely not complete...
[01:04:27] <sm> I suppose there have been games that use that ijkl layout (two player or dual joystick type games, where wasd is also used). Can't think of on offhand.
[01:04:31] <ManofLetters[m]> oh, a bummer, I only have one definition
[01:04:53] <sm> and anyway T-shaped layouts are the devil of course
[01:04:53] <ManofLetters[m]> for Left and one for Right
[01:04:57] <f-a> I chose them because it works on almost evry layout sm (qwerty, azerty etc.)
[01:05:03] <f-a> what would you prefer sm ?
[01:05:12] <f-a> of course I could make them rebindable
[01:05:48] <sm> diamond shaped (comma instead of k, but I take your point, comma might be somewhere else)
[01:05:58] <f-a> ohhh
[01:06:05] <f-a> I see
[01:06:27] <sm> and actually T-shaped is fine for slow paced games, but I really prefer diamond for action games where you can't look
[01:07:07] <sm> my only real issue here is the overlap with vi keys, which are very ingrained in muscle memory
[01:08:21] <sm> I suppose uhjk (or uhmk) could work too
[01:08:45] <f-a> this is very actionable and very useful feedback
[01:08:54] <sm> you avoided wasd/waxd so it can be right handed I guess ?
[01:09:49] <sm> (...but really, for maximum uptake with uncommitted new players, arrow keys win)
[01:09:50] <f-a> nope! I avoided it because it does *not* work on french layouts (which are azerty) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZERTY
[01:10:01] <sm> agh! good one!
[01:10:07] * sm was not aware
[01:10:28] <f-a> but yeah as a left handed person I always remap to them if possible
[01:10:32] <sm> wow, M is moved too
[01:10:36] <f-a> yup
[01:10:38] <ManofLetters[m]> f-a perhaps there is only one code for each arrow key after all?
[01:11:02] <f-a> I could tell you, but then I have to kill you
[01:11:16] <ManofLetters[m]> heh, I'd pass then
[01:11:23] <f-a> I have the faintest idea
[01:11:48] <f-a> once I can upgrate to ¬´new¬ª ghc IO I will poke at it myself
[01:11:51] <ManofLetters[m]> I couldn't find any more, unlike for some other keys
[01:12:05] <ManofLetters[m]> but it was just googling, not testing
[01:12:18] <ManofLetters[m]> looking up crazy old terminal configs
[01:21:12] <f-a> has anyone managed to clone that sabadev repo?
[01:21:28] <f-a> https://sabadev.xyz/avoidance_game I feel like a dork
[01:22:27] <ManofLetters[m]> how come you didn't manage to do it? :O
[01:22:37] <f-a> asks me for a password!
[01:22:48] <ManofLetters[m]> isn't that obvious?
[01:23:11] * ManofLetters[m] has fun trolling
[01:23:15] <f-a> :P
[01:23:22] <f-a> will write to them
[01:27:51] <f-a> http://www.ariis.it/link/t/paste3321000-0 there, let us see if we get a reply

[20:17:42] <f-a> also I feel I would ask the player to press their keys many times otherwise (here with one tap you move 3/5 characters, you would have to press ‚Üë‚Üë‚Üë in character-movement)

[22:57:33] <f-a> that is one weird setup but they made an ace blog post
[22:58:23] <sm> agreed
[22:59:32] <sm> wish we could reach them and maybe lure them here
[22:59:57] <f-a> if they reply, I will spam #haskell-game (for sure they use matrix)
