[00:03:51] <Berlin36> yeah, i used it for almost a year
[00:04:12] <amigojapan> Hey there Berlin36 
[00:04:18] <Berlin36> how are you
[00:04:24] <isekaijin> The only part that I don't remember all the steps of is configuring the bootloader.
[00:04:24] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: i tried to kill lxdm and xorg, but they just reload.
[00:04:35] <ButterNoodle> naa u have to systemctl
[00:04:57] <isekaijin> Maybe I should try Gentoo.
[00:04:59] <isekaijin> Arch is too easy.
[00:05:07] <ButterNoodle> systemctl stop lxdm - it respawns if u kill
[00:05:07] <Berlin36> why would you like harder

[00:05:25] <ButterNoodle> there isnt much difference

[00:06:32] <isekaijin> Gentoo is systemd-free, right?
[00:06:44] <ButterNoodle> *have u rebooted since updating anything?
[00:06:53] <ButterNoodle> isekaijin: it has a systemd free option
[00:07:03] <Bco1981> yeah have rebooted a couple of times

[00:08:25] <ButterNoodle> Bco1981: on another note.. u can disable network and enable NetworkManager on that install
[00:08:49] <ButterNoodle> bc for some reason the network script I put in there hangs when u reboot
[00:09:04] <Bco1981> no sound, i noticed that the networkmanager says it's not connected. but it is.

[06:40:45] <amigojapan> no problem isekaijin, you also support firefox who has been losing people and is about to go bankrupt, and it is th eonly mobile browser that allows plugins
[06:40:55] <ButterNoodle> nani the fuck
[06:41:16] <isekaijin> Well, the Mozilla Corporation has been horribly mismanaged for a while.
[06:41:31] <S4ll3n> speaking of rooted phones, samsung had all their scource code leaked
[06:41:40] <ButterNoodle> stop being a pussy and use netscape navigator

[06:42:23] <S4ll3n> librewolf is pretty good
[06:42:27] <isekaijin> S4ll3n: The problem is the complexity of the web. Only a large organization can maintain a standards-compliant Web browser.

[06:56:51] <average> amigojapan: I just feel it's unsafe to jailbreak, and honestly if anything adblockers should be the default on smartphones. It might be the platform that is mostly targetted by XSS attacks and whatnot. Especially because it's cumbersome and difficult and people don't really expect all this fuss on some device they carry in their pocket to call taxis, make phonecalls, order pizza, check bus/flight

[07:36:11] <MootPoot> it was also the kind that clipped onto my bicycle outside

[07:48:28] <MootPoot> but the JS maze of frameworks and crap stuck together

[07:48:57] <amigojapan> MootPoot: you probably think that because of react, there are other sane frameworks
[07:49:19] <amigojapan> react is totally crazy
[07:49:37] <MootPoot> but the thing is amigojapan - does it really matter if 80%+ of the jobs available is react?

[08:12:36] <MootPoot> oh that
[08:12:41] <MootPoot> yeah

[08:13:44] <amigojapan> xcode is nice too
[08:14:08] <klaxa> xamarin has a much harder time as it wants to be multi-platform
[08:14:50] <klaxa> so it's not surprising there are shortcomings compared to a platform focused solution
[08:14:58] <amigojapan> if only apple were nto evil, I would like it

[08:22:11] <klaxa> or if it has, not in public

[08:35:22] <MootPoot> And by the time you get to a usable screen size like 13 or 15 you might as well have bought a laptop anyways

[09:23:35] <isekaijin> Sapphirus: That's not something you should be testing at runtime anyway.
[09:23:45] <isekaijin> If you don't know in advance what your data structures are, you have bigger problems.
[09:24:25] <Sapphirus> isekaijin, the problem, more so rather, is that PHP is merging two distinct types of data structure into one, thus creating this ambiguity.
[09:24:50] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I think I Will Buy a hair trimmer to try and trim my beard
[09:25:18] <Sapphirus> No other language, not even Python, has this problem.
[09:25:33] <Sapphirus> PHP is a real bastard of a language. 
[09:28:29] <Sapphirus> In an ideal world, yes, you should be aware of your data structure and its type. PHP doesn't properly afford you the ability to properly define said data structures.
[09:29:46] <Sapphirus> This is one of many examples wherein ambiguity in PHP's design creates problems which shouldn't exist.

[09:32:48] <Sapphirus> That's about how long it takes for it to grow back to like 2-3 millimetres, sometimes longer -- it really depends on the season.
[09:33:00] <Sapphirus> Sometimes I can go a week and a half. 
[09:33:31] <ButterNoodle> yea I boycott razors..

[09:33:57] <MootPoot> I can't deal with beards
[09:34:04] <Sapphirus> A pack of razors can last a surprisingly long time if you only have to shave once a week minimum. 
[09:34:13] <MootPoot> I use a double edge safety razor - the ones where you replace a naked blade

[09:36:15] <ButterNoodle> at this rate I should be able to part small bodies of water soon
[09:36:44] <Sapphirus> Easier to hold a portable mirror in the shower than to break your back over a sink.

[10:07:25] <Sadale> MootPoot, what's an "escort" there in the website? So the girl'll be walking with you on the street?
[10:07:44] <amigojapan> MootPoot: and it is way more expensive
[10:07:44] <MootPoot> Sadale: an escort is a fancy word for a prostitute
[10:07:50] <Sadale> MootPoot, LOL
[10:08:02] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I am broke
[10:08:08] <MootPoot> Sadale: but the difference is the escort is usually higher quality and charges more
[10:08:16] <MootPoot> like, she might take you out on a date beforehand
[10:08:32] <MootPoot> rather then a 30 second cum and out the doo
[10:08:33] <Sadale> MootPoot, lol they're so expensive indeed
[10:08:34] <MootPoot> door
[10:08:45] <MootPoot> Sadale: I mean smoochi is expensive for no reason - its the only website like it
[10:08:55] <MootPoot> IRL you can get it for a lot less
[10:09:03] <Sadale> $250 a session. wow. I could buy several onaholes with that amount of money
[10:09:16] <MootPoot> Sadale: imagine it being like dating a prostitute but with no commitments
[10:09:40] <Sadale> Anyway even if it's inexpensive I won't be reserving a prostitute. I'm loyal to my imouto :3

[10:13:19] <MootPoot> Sadale: what if you buy your imouto for the night :3
[10:13:24] <isekaijin> Think of it like going to the hairdresser. Are you cheating on your imouto because you use a hairdresser's services?
[10:14:25] <ButterNoodle> I just need a cute girl to hug and grind while I sleep

[15:30:39] <isekaijin> I don't think the lack of a physical keyboard is the main obstacle when using a phone as a main computer.
[15:30:47] <amigojapan> isekaijin: I think especiallly in Japan there are plently of people that only have a phone or tablet at all

[15:55:38] <amigojapan> isekaijin: and using a trusted repo

[16:22:27] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: the problem has alreeady been diagnosed as slipped disc
[16:22:41] <DunceCotus> doesn't that require surgery
[16:22:42] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: what happened to worsen your back pain?
[16:22:57] <darkwitch> oh, I could try doing surgery
[16:22:59] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: they dont give surgery to overweight people tho

[16:23:15] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: not sure, maybe the weather changing

[16:23:55] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: yep
[16:24:31] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: is it cause the disc will slip again if they fix it, due to your weight?
[16:24:48] <DunceCotus> or are they just fatphobic
[16:24:51] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I guess so
[16:25:10] <DunceCotus> well if you can't even walk how are you going to lose weight
[16:25:20] <DunceCotus> baffling medical advice
[16:25:23] <darkwitch> japan isn't used to fat
[16:25:25] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: diet?
[16:25:49] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: I would say exercise is a component in weight loss too
[16:25:58] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: first of all, they dont give anyone any kind of surgery unless they are under 100 KG
[16:25:58] <DunceCotus> and you don't want to starve yourself
[16:26:20] <DunceCotus> good gravy
[16:26:36] <DunceCotus> that sounds like fatphobia
[16:26:40] <HubertFarnsworth> no DunceCotus, it's not because it'll slip again
[16:26:42] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: not even emergency surgery
[16:26:52] <HubertFarnsworth> there will serious health issues
[16:27:03] <HubertFarnsworth> and complications
[16:27:17] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth: I guess
[16:27:40] <DunceCotus> slipped disc sounds pretty serious already

[16:28:19] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I think so
[16:28:23] <darkwitch> other countries don't care if you're overweight, so it must be lack of experience, since near all japanese are super thin

[16:37:56] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: maybe you're thinking of Richard Dawkins

[16:44:19] <amigojapan> ah ok, cosmos, let me see
[16:44:39] <HubertFarnsworth> shitty people too lazy to read
[16:46:55] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: cosmos is available in Japanese, but only in paper, not on kindle
[16:47:47] <HubertFarnsworth> amigojapan: would she read it on paper?
[16:48:00] <HubertFarnsworth> in* paper
[16:48:10] <amigojapan> HubertFarnsworth: yeah, but paper is pretty expensive, compared to kindle versions
[16:48:57] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, I do love physical copies though
[16:49:06] <amigojapan> I see
[16:49:19] <darkwitch> in russia they have roscosmos
[16:49:31] <amigojapan> lol darkwitch
[16:49:34] <HubertFarnsworth> hardcover ones with acid free paper, good font
[16:49:43] <lastonestanding> !c gallon
[16:49:44] <ImoutoBot> lastonestanding: The gallon is a unit of volume in imperial units and United States customary units. Three different versions are in current use:
[16:49:49] <HubertFarnsworth> nice cover
[16:49:49] <amigojapan> acid free? HubertFarnsworth
[16:49:49] <HubertFarnsworth> preface
[16:51:02] <HubertFarnsworth> yes amigojapan, I don't remember the technical details but it's a better quality paper, lasts longer
[16:51:16] <amigojapan> I see
[16:51:17] <lastonestanding> do you buy 1 gallon milk in the US, not 1 litre?
[16:51:30] <amigojapan> yes lastonestanding
[16:51:36] <DunceCotus> the world doesn't just produce the new
[16:51:41] <DunceCotus> it produces the old in relation to the new
[16:51:57] <HubertFarnsworth> the americans are not yet here lastonestanding 
[16:52:04] <amigojapan> darkwitch: it seems DunceCotus autotriggered
[16:52:05] <HubertFarnsworth> only Australasians
[16:52:16] <DunceCotus> how does someone who lived through the 60s experience our contemporary moment? This is also being produced alongside the contemporaneous
[16:52:24] <darkwitch> one gallon sounds like way too much milk to buy at one time
[16:52:54] <DunceCotus> HubertFarnsworth: well we're broadly still awake/sleep
[16:52:56] <lastonestanding> why you say that?
[16:53:02] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: some people think only the present exists
[16:53:11] <HubertFarnsworth> We buy 1litre of milk per day
[16:53:12] <lastonestanding> isn't one gallon like 3 litres?
[16:53:24] <HubertFarnsworth> lol lastonestanding, no!!
[16:53:24] <amigojapan> darkwitch: even I can only drink one liter in one day
[16:53:30] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: all historical objects are re-created in relation to the present 
[16:53:35] <lastonestanding> then how much is it?
[16:53:45] <HubertFarnsworth> around 4-5
[16:53:49] <HubertFarnsworth> lire
[16:53:49] <lastonestanding> no way
[16:53:50] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: its almost 4 liters
[16:53:58] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah
[16:53:58] <lastonestanding> ohh
[16:54:13] <lastonestanding> then what is the point of gallon?
[16:54:20] <HubertFarnsworth> I am sure it's more than 4L amigojapan 
[16:54:29] <amigojapan> lastonestanding: gasoline is also sold by gallons
[16:54:32] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its not so much only the present exists, but rather the present is a quasi-causal, auto-production
[16:54:43] <amigojapan> !c 1 gallon to liters
[16:54:44] <ImoutoBot> amigojapan: 1 Gallon = 4.54609 Liter
[16:54:52] <amigojapan> wow it is
[16:55:08] <lastonestanding> only americans write 'liter'
[16:55:10] <darkwitch> cars drink more gas than I drink milk
[16:55:32] <HubertFarnsworth> the gallon thing comes from pints and quarts lastonestanding

[16:57:56] <DunceCotus> nope

[16:58:50] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: though I think it has to do with this 'recreating'
[16:59:06] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: its not just simulacra i'm talking, even our ideas of the past, that is a changing of the past
[16:59:51] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: as in the 'effective past' of what influences how our present is produced
[16:59:55] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: sure those do  change

[17:00:31] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: there is definitely an 80s mood 
[17:00:41] <DunceCotus> I wish we'd move into the 90s again
[17:00:42] <DunceCotus> xD
[17:00:57] <DunceCotus> or early 90s anyway.. 1990-1998
[17:01:03] <amigojapan> eventually DunceCotus
[17:01:16] <DunceCotus> none of this late 90s cynicism and arrogance

[17:01:53] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: nothing is 'inevitable'

[17:05:46] <amigojapan> lol good one DunceCotus!
[17:06:15] <DunceCotus> I dunno there's exciting stuff still happening
[17:06:31] <DunceCotus> despite the morass of reactive forces we have to evade or wade
[17:06:45] <emmeka> amigojapan if it's any consolation, economic growth during the roaring 20s didn't start really until 1923, and we're currently in relatively strong economic growth right now
[17:07:27] <amigojapan> emmeka: still these definitely shoould be called the boring 20s
[17:07:34] <DunceCotus> Twenty Twenty Twenty
[17:07:51] <emmeka> but maybe roaring 20s 2.0 will be from the roar of missiles from air strikes
[17:07:56] <emmeka> who knows
[17:08:08] <amigojapan> ouch
[17:08:23] <DunceCotus> I think the age of "this decade" is over
[17:08:41] <DunceCotus> there's not going to be clearly delineated 'generations' and 'decades' anymore
[17:08:47] <DunceCotus> its just a MASS
[17:08:55] <DunceCotus> of stuff happening
[17:09:10] <emmeka> it seems that way 20 years ago too, and yet, we can distinctly refer to the 2000s as a particular decade
[17:09:25] <DunceCotus> emmeka: 2000 sure
[17:09:30] <DunceCotus> 2010s? much less so
[17:09:39] <emmeka> sure, 2010s are a distinct decade
[17:09:51] <darkwitch> we went from the age of pandemic to the age of putin. what comes next is uncertain.
[17:09:51] <DunceCotus> it seemed like an extension of 2000
[17:09:54] <DunceCotus> no clear break
[17:09:55] <emmeka> we're only 2 years removed from them so it doesn't seem as distinct yet, just "pre-covid"
[17:10:09] <emmeka> what do you mean no clear break, there's the biggest clear break ever
[17:10:13] <emmeka> clean as could be
[17:10:20] <amigojapan> darkwitch: I am not getting dragged in by the putin stuff
[17:10:31] <emmeka> in January 2020 the world basically completely changed overnight
[17:10:58] <DunceCotus> emmeka: covid isn't a break
[17:11:03] <DunceCotus> its just an extension of control
[17:11:09] <emmeka> uh huh.
[17:11:13] <darkwitch> amigojapan, you are too far away, some of us are closer
[17:11:21] <MootPoot> ohmygerd its <censored>
[17:11:24] <DunceCotus> emmeka: culturally it hasn't really changed much I don't think
[17:11:30] <amigojapan> darkwitch: putin would need to tare my peace form my dead body
[17:11:32] <DunceCotus> emmeka: but yes, it was a shock to the system
[17:11:34] <emmeka> if anything amigojapan is the closest of us to Russian territory, with a few exceptions
[17:11:55] <emmeka> Vladivostok isn't that far from the Japanese coast
[17:12:00] <amigojapan> darkwitch: someone has swam form russia to japan
[17:12:09] <DunceCotus> most of the shock is just how utterly silly the covid media/alt-media got
[17:12:22] <DunceCotus> and the varied political responses of course
[17:12:23] <emmeka> DunceCotus I think you'd have to be living under a rock to think there has been no change to culture since before COVID
[17:12:32] <DunceCotus> like they were testing out various political theories
[17:12:34] <darkwitch> that sounds like a long and cold swim
[17:12:37] <DunceCotus> it was an interesting 'test bed' scenario
[17:12:55] <amigojapan> darkwitch: probably done in summer
[17:12:57] <emmeka> the entire way we engage with culture changed, and that's not some weird temporary blip, it has permanent effects
[17:12:58] <DunceCotus> emmeka: there hasn't
[17:13:07] <DunceCotus> has it?
[17:13:18] <DunceCotus> we now can do work from home or zoom people more
[17:13:19] <DunceCotus> meeeh
[17:13:38] <darkwitch> amigojapan, I thought you meant it happened recently
[17:13:42] <DunceCotus> we don't want to spread germs so we're not gonna touch as much (anti-touch) this is just extensions of pre-covid
[17:13:49] <DunceCotus> but sure there is a 'post' and 'pre' covid
[17:13:58] <amigojapan> it did darkwitch, for me anything after 2001 is recent
[17:14:07] <emmeka> yes? I mean for one mass culture effectively was cancelled for 2 years, the entire notion of how careers work changed, digital life became not just this pervasive distraction *from* modern life but the very essence and foundation *of* modern life
[17:14:21] <emmeka> whole countries borders closed for years
[17:14:35] <emmeka> like how is this even a conversation, where have you been
[17:14:36] <DunceCotus> emmeka: I don't know if the capitalists or governments have learned their lesson though
[17:14:52] <amigojapan> emmeka: Japan is still closed
[17:15:53] <DunceCotus> emmeka: I dunno, there has been a culture shift sure
[17:16:28] <DunceCotus> Im just not sure its something revolutionary
[17:17:20] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: we are probably just numb to change
[17:18:25] <DunceCotus> THAT BEING SAID, I think some of the most interesting leftist theory is being developed right now
[17:18:33] <DunceCotus> so this is still a very exciting time
[17:18:39] <DunceCotus> boring for some tho
[17:19:17] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: emmeka I dont think the shock value of covid was as big as the 9/11 one
[17:19:20] <DunceCotus> there's still a dreary dull atmosphere we have to work to enliven
[17:19:27] <emmeka> amigojapan well, that's true.
[17:20:18] <emmeka> 9/11 the whole world just stopped for a day and stared in terror, and was never the same again afterwards
[17:20:35] <DunceCotus> well covid has shocked capitalism into.. maybe not being so shit with regard to environment/worker health
[17:20:35] <amigojapan> yup
[17:20:40] <emmeka> COVID felt more like everyone was just like "ugh, what now?!" to each increasing step in the pandemic
[17:21:10] <amigojapan> right
[17:21:26] <DunceCotus> but I fear capitalism has a short memory (and short-term forecasting)
[17:21:44] <DunceCotus> and workers well they will have to ride this wave of a maybe semi-reformed capitalism
[17:21:50] <emmeka> well, things are interesting right now in the economy. we have the rare scenario of labour shortage
[17:22:03] <DunceCotus> meanwhile being squeezed into new identarian boxes
[17:22:23] <emmeka> which means you should be organizing fucking unions left right and centre and abandoning any boss who will not give you whatever you want.
[17:22:47] <DunceCotus> abandoning is not an option for many
[17:22:55] <DunceCotus> there isn't an immediate safety net
[17:22:55] <amigojapan> emmeka: I thikn I will be able to keep on telecommuting
[17:23:19] <DunceCotus> emmeka: you see workers are also short-term forecasters
[17:24:08] <emmeka> in all seriousness: if anyone here wants advice on unionization, how unionization drives work and how to go about it smartly, I have personally been involved in 2 unionization drives, 1 successful, and would be happy to help.
[17:24:10] <DunceCotus> this is the taking up of capitalist tenants 
[17:25:24] <DunceCotus> unionisation makes sense in an industrial context
[17:25:49] <DunceCotus> in other contexts its much harder to get the unity
[17:26:05] <DunceCotus> because these are often even more shit-kicker jobs and workplaces than factories
[17:26:19] <DunceCotus> these are the intellectual capital factories
[17:27:24] <Bco1981> oh my god, a linux desktop runs so much better with the nvidia repository driver in combination with a 144hz monitor.
[17:27:43] <Bco1981> but i can't get that god damn sound to work... yet.
[17:28:47] <emmeka> Bco1981 yeah, I try to tell people this, the open source drivers for Nvidia GPUs are shit
[17:29:06] <emmeka> always gotta install the proprietary one
[17:29:17] <Bco1981> the nouvaau driver is so laggy on a desktop
[17:29:27] <Bco1981> nouveau*
[17:30:00] <emmeka> it's not their fault, really. Nvidia refuses to play nice with any open source project for their drivers, so nouveau is entirely just reverse-engineered
[17:30:19] <emmeka> and inferior because of it
[17:31:22] <emmeka> I don't really understand the logic to it. Like great, you've voluntarily made any FOSS fanboys loyal to your competitor. congrats.
[17:31:24] <Bco1981> thanks to ButterNoodle's arch install script i am learning quite a bit about setting up arch. am making my own version out of his script.
[17:31:29] <DunceCotus> the political space of computer hardware manufacturing and distribution
[17:31:36] <Bco1981> including nvidia driver during install.
[17:32:13] <Bco1981> but do to my lack of coding skills, it's very static.
[17:32:55] <MootPoot> emmeka: supposedly the hackers who got nvidia said they would release the driver code today
[17:33:02] <MootPoot> if nvidia didn't FOSS it themselves
[17:33:13] <emmeka> lol that's one way
[17:33:44] <Bco1981> pretty sure nvidia will sue anyone making use of that code.
[17:33:55] <MootPoot> how would you even prove it though
[17:34:02] <MootPoot> just release the code from china
[17:34:02] <emmeka> pretty easily
[17:34:04] <MootPoot> :3
[17:34:05] <MootPoot> ez
[17:34:14] <emmeka> sure, but then no real FOSS project could use it
[17:34:23] <Bco1981> ^
[17:34:30] <Bco1981> that's the people they will sue
[17:34:57] <MootPoot> well, its not about using the code...its about digging into what the code does and then replicating it - if they do it differently enough maybe they can get clear
[17:35:09] <MootPoot> assuming there is a way to do it more then one way
[17:36:19] <emmeka> I think it would take as much effort to completely rewrite the code in a way that would stand up to snuff in a court of law as not copied from the leak, as it would to simply improve the quality of the existing driver on their own
[17:36:30] <emmeka> not to mention, Nvidia would probably sue anyway
[17:36:50] <emmeka> which, obviously these projects don't have the resources to fight them
[17:37:27] <emmeka> ideally Nvidia would just realize it's stupid not to collaborate with FOSS projects willing to effectively market and support their products for them for free, the way AMD has
[17:38:34] <emmeka> but for now they don't, so your only option is to avoid Nvidia hardware in linux builds, or use their proprietary driver (which, no distro installs by default, for the obvious reason that a FOSS alternative is available even if inferior)
[17:39:11] <Bco1981> time to wipe the system.... A-gain
[17:39:26] <emmeka> grinding Arch installs
[17:39:30] <amigojapan> emmeka: they could release it on the pirate bay. I don't think Nvidia can know who is using the driver on their own personal computer unless the confess
[17:39:34] <emmeka> soon you'll have enough XP to level up
[17:39:34] <Bco1981> yeah.

[17:49:21] <emmeka> next day, overdraft is somehow not in my line of credit?

[17:56:33] <emmeka> I was just re-organizing some debts now that I have a really low interest line of credit to use. What it's *supposed* to do is apply whatever overdraft is on the chequing account to the line of credit every day at midnight. This just didn't happen on Friday at midnight, for some reason.
[17:57:08] <emmeka> and ofc it's now fucking Saturday so I can't just call the person who set it up and be like "hey wtf"

[19:45:21] <HubertFarnsworth> wait, really?
[19:45:22] <KatrinValerie> It will be hard to tell how the first one went down, once there have been many more.
[19:45:33] <KatrinValerie> Because memory is never 1:1
[19:45:38] <HubertFarnsworth> you don't remember your first tongue kiss?
[19:45:38] <emmeka> I can't say I remember mine
[19:45:49] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: Memory does not work like in movies.
[19:45:59] <KatrinValerie> It's spooky, but the truth
[19:46:41] <KatrinValerie> What you remember about yourself could be entirely fabricated :D thank me later for putting that thought in your head.
[19:47:02] <KatrinValerie> Well, tbh usually our memories are a melange of things that really happened
[19:47:08] <Bco1981> the exact reason i sometimes do not trust my own memory.
[19:47:09] <KatrinValerie> and things we have seen
[19:47:20] <emmeka> I mean think about it, HubertFarnsworth do you remember with great detail the first time in life you had an orgasm. probably not.
[19:47:21] <KatrinValerie> We easily confuse the origin of a memory for example
[19:47:38] <isekaijin> I trust my memory with important things like the names of the capital cities of most countries in the world.
[19:47:43] <isekaijin> But my first kiss? Fuck no.
[19:47:50] <emmeka> lol same
[19:48:02] <HubertFarnsworth> I don't mean like every single detail KatrinValerie . What about the time of the day, with whom, the experience and what it was like..
[19:48:11] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: I do, but it was an extremly painful and gross experience...
[19:48:14] <Bco1981> i am a visual memory person. and i can fabricate anything in my mind... so can't 100% trust it sometimes.
[19:48:23] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth I mean I remember their name
[19:48:28] <emmeka> that's about it
[19:49:46] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: how many details you get depends on how far back the event happened and how frequently you recall it
[19:49:51] <KatrinValerie> Memory degrades over time
[19:49:52] <emmeka> really, I can barely remember the first time I had sex, which probably seems unthinkable to a virgin
[19:50:00] <KatrinValerie> With few exceptions
[19:50:00] <HubertFarnsworth> now that I think about it, I don't remember my first orgasm. Not sure which one is first.
[19:50:09] <KatrinValerie> Traumatic events usually burn themselves into memory
[19:50:58] *** Joins: pcyo (~pcyo@user/pcyo)
[19:51:03] <HubertFarnsworth> emmeka: do you remember like which song or music is playing during first sex?
[19:51:05] <KatrinValerie> So many details will be present and it's easy to recall things really lively, it is also very very unpleasent and when it becomes a flashback I end up wrecking things
[19:51:13] <emmeka> uhhhhh why would there be music
[19:51:19] <emmeka> life doesn't generally have BGM
[19:51:57] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: You would remember a lot if you think about it a lot
[19:52:09] <emmeka> do you think people generally put on music to have sex, especially when they're like, idiot teenagers fumbling through their first time
[19:52:14] <HubertFarnsworth> yup
[19:52:18] <KatrinValerie> Or if something made the moment very emotional, it can also imprint the memory more strongly
[19:52:24] <KatrinValerie> but over time, all memories fade
[19:52:27] <HubertFarnsworth> I remember my first Wodehouse book I read
[19:52:38] <HubertFarnsworth> and how much I enjoyed it
[19:52:50] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: BGM sure does help if it has the right bpm
[19:53:45] <KatrinValerie> It is evening, time for the days last cig?
[19:54:17] <emmeka> mfw I can remember random trivia I read once like 15 years ago but fucked if I can remember in any detail major life events that happened to me in the same time period
[19:54:57] <S4ll3n> lol, I try to block out most of my teenage years
[19:55:14] <HubertFarnsworth> are you smoking again KatrinValerie?
[19:55:32] <emmeka> I can remember with great detail having witnessed the miracle on the Hudson, and can remember that I definitely slept with someone on that same trip to NYC, but I can't really remember their name or much about it
[19:55:33] <KatrinValerie> emmeka: there are things that can hamper your memory
[19:55:43] <isekaijin> HubertFarnsworth: Of course, reading a book is a much more special experience than having sex.
[19:55:55] <KatrinValerie> Drugs being the most obvious one and that includes medical drugs

[19:56:09] <HubertFarnsworth> by Hudson miracle, you mean that plane landing on sea emmeka?
[19:56:26] <HubertFarnsworth> isekaijin: you're right
[19:56:28] <KatrinValerie> The painkillers I got for my trigeminus neuralgia almost completely erased my memories of a school year
[19:56:46] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth in the river, but yes. I was in Manhattan during the plane crash landing into the Hudson river.

[19:56:51] <ImoutoBot> HubertFarnsworth: Quote added for isekaijin (1)
[19:57:35] <KatrinValerie> I wish I could forget some books that I read
[19:58:14] <emmeka> HubertFarnsworth and I can recall that, during that same trip, I definitely got laid. Which I'm *pretty* sure wasn't my first time, but not 100% sure. And I can't remember anything about it beyond that.
[19:58:15] <KatrinValerie> they were bad and they take up storage space
[19:58:17] <HubertFarnsworth> which ones KatrinValerie? heart of darkness?
[19:58:20] <emmeka> I remember what they looked like, vaguely
[19:58:41] <emmeka> but the plane crash is definitely more vivid in my memory. priorities?
[19:58:52] <KatrinValerie> HubertFarnsworth: they were bad, why would I remember their title? it's just that the plot takes up space in my head and it does not pay rent.
[19:59:08] <KatrinValerie> Would you let anyone live in your head rent free?
[19:59:16] <HubertFarnsworth> lol emmeka 
[19:59:55] <KatrinValerie> bbl

[20:59:33] <Bco1981> and you can find several pages, probably even books about this.
[21:00:06] <Bco1981> as to how to make a proper size swap partition^
[21:00:37] <Poeticode> fedora goes by how much ram you have. My machine has 16gb so by default it sets 8gb of swap space

[22:14:30] <HubertFarnsworth> Is that Delhi?
[22:14:43] <lastonestanding> no, it's a documentary about some city in Pakistan
[22:14:51] <teus> i had one friend, she got one boyfriend after the other. a friend chased after her for a long, long time and managed to date and keep her
[22:14:56] <lastonestanding> Lahore
[22:14:59] <HubertFarnsworth> which one lastonestanding?
[22:15:00] <teus> now she's just some cranky bitch
[22:15:05] <lastonestanding> never heard of it before
[22:15:12] <lastonestanding> do you know Lahore?
[22:15:31] <lastonestanding> ah lolol
[22:15:33] <HubertFarnsworth> sure
[22:15:34] <KatrinValerie> I read a bit of the manga and remember quitting pretty soon because I found it was bad, but I can't recall why
[22:15:36] <lastonestanding> "Lahore is the capital of the Pakistani province of Punjab and is the country's 2nd largest city after Karachi..."
[22:15:45] <lastonestanding> it's in Punjab!! :D
[22:15:47] <teus> KatrinValerie: the anime is alright
[22:15:51] <teus> super niche
[22:16:06] <KatrinValerie> teus: if you want pseudo deep shit with lots of porn in it, watch gantz
[22:16:13] <teus> o h i have
[22:16:16] <teus> gantz isnt deep
[22:16:27] <lastonestanding> watch hentai
[22:16:28] <KatrinValerie> read the manga, it tries really hard to be deep

[22:16:35] <teus> ive skimmed through it
[22:16:37] <KatrinValerie> anyways, bbl
[22:16:49] <KatrinValerie> teus: the ending makes you wish you never read anything
[22:16:55] <teus> i totally get it, if the manga is like that
[22:17:07] <KatrinValerie> it made me want to purge all my memories of the series
[22:17:14] <teus> in a good or bad way
[22:17:18] <HubertFarnsworth> I mean good ones you played if you have Bco1981 
[22:17:52] <KatrinValerie> teus: it's mostly really really nasty stuff horrible world building and story telling, forced deus ex machina all the time to keep MC-kun and gf alive
[22:18:01] <teus> oh -_-
[22:18:10] <KatrinValerie> like, I actually wanted that guy to die by the last few chapters
[22:18:12] <teus> nobody else where who a) knows the manga/anime and b) isnt an unwanted virgin?
[22:18:21] <KatrinValerie> I was like, common I know you won't but I wish you would kill that bloke off
[22:18:37] <teus> asian endings to a story can be weird
[22:18:45] <teus> and very indecisive or unpleasant
[22:18:54] <KatrinValerie> That is the point of that ending I know

[22:19:39] <Bco1981> HubertFarnsworth: probably, but none i know of.

[22:30:57] <ButterNoodle> another one.. do a lspci and find ur sound card... google on that to see if anyone has had pain with it.
[22:31:29] <HubertFarnsworth> yeah, they should make it expert+ or expert++
[22:31:36] <Bco1981> ButterNoodle: yeah, from the initial syslinux boot sequence, the screen blanks and then should continue the boot process, but it would just hang on a black screen and the cursor blinking in the top right corner.
[22:31:43] <ButterNoodle> bet the manjaro folks have something to say, and you can write ur first arch wiki article on it :)

[22:33:33] <ButterNoodle> I live on cli :|
[22:33:58] <ButterNoodle> but the linux sound thing is not a new issue..
[22:34:33] <ButterNoodle> if u boot up manjaro live and take a look at the lsmod, and those 2 etc directories I bet there is a clue there
[22:35:03] <ButterNoodle> *another thing.. if u boot to fallback image see if sound works, that would mean there is a module not loading properly
[22:35:57] <Bco1981> but they are loading, and i can see the name, and everything looks like it's working... there is just no sound. no matter how much i mute/unmute stuff.

Because I don't have time to deal with compositing and all the other protocols & things that would be needed in wayland, I just want  to make a WM, which is just the UX part.

[23:30:50] <DPA> The display server doesn't connect to the WM in X11, the WM is just another X11 client. The WM connects to the display server. It just requests to get some events so it can know about, show, hide and place windows.

[23:33:18] <lastonestanding> similar to a virtual machine
[23:33:50] <lastonestanding> or like you can run weston inside a window under X
[23:34:48] <DPA> A WM is pointless if it can't control the windows. Sure, it may be possible to run it in a window, but that won't help with managing wayland windows.
[23:35:11] <lastonestanding> very obvious
[23:37:07] <DPA> In wayland, the WM part is done by the shell, which is basically a display server, doing all the compositing, and basically placing the windows by compositing them. It also has to provide many of the protocols the wayland clients expect. There are some libraries to abstract some of that work away, such as wlroots, but I think it's still to much work to be reasonable.
