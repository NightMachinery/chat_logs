[10:27:52] <j416> pull is fetch + merge

[12:30:31] <famubu> `git submodule foreach 'git fetch; git checkout origin master` too didn't show any changes..
[12:30:55] <osse> you replaced / with a space for some reason
[12:30:56] <famubu> I had been searching for some file with an entry like `Subproject ...` Any idea where that is?
[12:31:05] <famubu> osse: Oh.. sorry. Let me try again.
[12:31:38] <famubu> Using / instead space too had no effect in output of git status.
[12:32:20] <osse> then go into a submodule, run those commands and tell me what they print
[12:32:47] <famubu> I think the location where the commit hash of a submodule are stored is in a file with a beginning with `Subproject commit <hash>`
[12:33:02] <osse> No it isn't. That's just how git diff etc. prints it
[12:33:31] <osse> it is stored right next to the other files and directories in the tree objects
[12:34:47] <famubu> I tried `git fetch; git checkout origin/master' in one of the submodules and got this as output: https://bpa.st/YAPA

[12:37:46] <famubu> Maybe I should create a repo of my own to see how this works with a few submodules in it. Let me do that.
[12:39:09] <famubu> It shows the list of submodules with what looks like their last commit hashes when the parent repo was made. The submodules have changed since.
[12:39:42] <osse> is the submodule cd'ed into in that list?
[12:39:47] <osse> *you cd'ed into
[12:41:04] <famubu> Yes. It's there. I compared the commit hash mentioned there with that of the latest changes in that repo. It's a few commits behind.

[16:00:15] <famubu> Then tried on friend's computer with a newer git.

[20:32:08] <Guest32> Another developer and I are working on a project called ETMU. We decided to use an integration branch for our development called "etmu_integration_epic". Our company has branches defined for QA, UAT, etc... So, the other developer and I will make our changes in etmu_integation_epic, and when we are done we will push our changes to the QA branch and
[20:32:09] <Guest32> have QA test. A lot of times, by the time QA is done testing, we will already have worked on more features, and pushed them to our etmu_integration_epic branch. So, QA will say, let's release what you pushed to QA, to UAT now. But at that point, etmu_integration_epic has some more features that have not been vetted yet by QA.
[20:33:54] <ikke> Couldn't you release what's in the QA branch then?
[20:33:59] <ikke> or move it to UAT
[20:35:15] <Guest32> I can't send a PR from etmu_integration_epic -> UAT, because it will include 2 additional unvetted features
[20:35:37] <OnlineCop> Our work method is to create a feature branch, pass that to QA. Then create a NEW feature branch starting from where the old one left off (it if depends on the previous fix; if not, start it from main/master). Each new feature gets its own branch name.
[20:35:50] <Guest32> I think I'm probably doing something stupid. Hence reaching out to the git gods

[20:38:42] <Guest32> I think that may be our first mistake. We don't typically create branches for every one feature. We have been working in this etmu_integration_branch and we have been doing PRs from that. So it is a collection of features
[20:38:46] *** Quits: visualshock (~visualsho@38.51-175-121.customer.lyse.net) (Quit: Leaving)
[20:40:34] <Guest32> if I were to commit to the one branch per feature strategy, I am wondering how that might work. Say, we had (3 bug fixes OR features) for ETMU. We would create some branches, maybe: etmu_fix_ui_issue_1, etmu_fix_database_issue, etmu_fix_missing_text_issue
[20:40:49] <ikke> Having specific branches for features makes it easier to select specific things to merge / release
[20:41:03] <ikke> but it complicates features building on top of eachother
[20:41:26] <Guest32> and then before the PR to QA, would we create an integration branch of those features? or just PR those feature branches direct to QA...
[20:41:43] <ikke> But when you called it an integration branch, I assumed it was a branch you merge other branches into to integrate them

[20:42:20] <ikke> Not saying you have to follow that, but it can help with inspiration
[20:42:22] <Guest32> yeah, sorry, it is probably the wrong term. Another developer and I are working on this same branch. I don't know if there's a term for this
[20:42:55] <Guest32> I read briefly about it earlier. git flow doesn't seem to have qa and uat branching, so it seems a little different than what I do?
[20:43:09] <ikke> Guest32: it just means some extra steps
[20:44:03] <ikke> but, in gitflow terms, you would start a release branch, which the QA and UAT teams would test
[20:44:12] <mackerman> Guest32: Does  the "integration" part of the name refer to  "git merge", or is it the name of the thing you are working on?

[20:45:22] <Guest32> the etmu_integration branch is poorly named. It is not being used for git merging. It is only indicating that another developer and I are integrating our features and fixes together into one branch.

[22:01:52] <k8yun> yep
[22:01:54] <k8yun> agreed
[22:02:18] <ikke> so yes, git remote update, just as git fetch and git push supports using a PAT

[22:02:35] <ikke> but I assume you want this to be persisted
[22:03:09] <k8yun> why does it require me to authenticate to use `git remote update`?  And, if I do need to require to authenticate, can't I use PAT?

[22:03:18] <k8yun> does it?
[22:03:22] <k8yun> yes
[22:03:23] <mackerman> remote update  is a different syntax for fetch

[22:05:35] <NeilRG> how do I checkout HEAD~1 without using "git checkout"?
[22:05:44] <NeilRG> git switch and git restore don't do it
[22:06:27] <ikke> git switch and checkout are the same in this regard (though switch might need some options)
[22:06:55] <k8yun> I think I should just use `git fetch`; eof
[22:07:11] <ikke> k8yun: yes
[22:07:30] <ikke> NeilRG: git switch --detach HEAD~
[22:07:32] <NeilRG> ikke, thanks, --detach
