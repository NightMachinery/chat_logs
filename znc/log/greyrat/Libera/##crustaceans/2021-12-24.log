[00:00:22] <manicennui> Oh, I think the alien is from the Land of Lisp book, no?

[00:04:36] <indigo> > Back in the eighties, we showed you how to program without having any bugs
[00:04:40] <indigo> This comic didn't age well
[00:07:27] <imode> what comic.
[00:07:47] <indigo> http://landoflisp.com/
[00:07:50] <indigo> Scroll to the bottom
[00:09:23] <imode> "back in the eighties"
[00:09:28] <imode> what haughty shit is this.
[00:09:56] <dminkovsky> what haughty shit
[00:10:09] <imode> this comic. it was made post-2006, for sure.
[00:10:44] <manicennui> I'd argue that a lot of current PLT is trying to fix problems that were "solved" by lisp in the 60s.
[00:10:46] <indigo> Right, cause of the Wii reference
[00:11:32] <imode> it's good that you wrote "solved" in quotes, manicennui. I don't think they're solved at all, or have been solved. but they got pretty close.
[00:12:00] <manicennui> I think most of the problems with lisp at that point were hardware performance, and those don't exist now.
[00:12:14] <manicennui> Most of the problems now are probably the ecosystem and community.
[00:13:37] <manicennui> I think the other problems we try to solve now are fundamentally unsolvable.
[00:14:22] <manicennui> Like trying to produce massive systems (problem one), with people of varying skill levels (problem two), that work for the widest possible audience (problem three).
[00:15:00] <imode> there's an underlying theme to those: growth.
[00:15:11] <imode> avoid excessive growth, software stays small.
[00:15:56] <indigo> Or just accept that it won't be perfect, and you'll eventually converge on something acceptable
[00:16:11] <manicennui> And if you don't think lisp solved most real problems, throw ML in for good measure. =P
[00:16:25] <companion_cube> \o/
[00:16:36] <manicennui> Which comes from the 70s
[00:17:32] <indigo> Just stack more layers
[00:17:40] <imode> I'd rather just have my software be small, thank you.
[00:17:49] <imode> don't need all of this hyper-growth bullshit.
[00:18:03] <manicennui> Add every feature from lisp and ML to your language, and claim that you are doing cutting edge PL design.
[00:20:01] <manicennui> It's just blatantly obvious that having so many people relying on a handful of services is a really bad idea, even if you set aside the fact that those services must try to make all of those users happy.
[00:20:38] <manicennui> You could probably collapse our economy by taking down AWS and Gmail.
[00:21:12] <imode> because we never made it a priority to put the power of those services into the hands of the lowest common denominator, only the interfaces to them.
[00:21:26] <imode> you have the power to host an e-mail server in your pocket.
[00:21:35] <imode> and yet, here we are.
[00:21:42] <manicennui> Unfortunately gmail will probably block your emails.
[00:21:51] <imode> gmail shouldn't exist.
[00:23:30] <manicennui> Hotmail and Yahoo Mail had such a huge lead.
[00:24:05] <manicennui> MS and Yahoo never figured out how to compete with other Internet services.
[00:24:07] <companion_cube> funnily, once again, gmail's initial advantage of speed is totally lost
[00:24:09] <companion_cube> it's become crappy AF
[00:26:31] <indigo> I thought Gmail's initial advantage was lots of storage space
[00:27:09] <manicennui> I think it was both.
[00:27:16] <manicennui> A lot of people liked that it was simple and fast.
[00:27:36] <manicennui> I honestly can't remember why I switched from Yahoo Mail.
[00:27:43] <manicennui> I think they also did spam filtering better early on.
[00:29:06] <indigo> I remember that 1GB of space for your mail was unheard of then
[00:29:22] <indigo> And that everyone was scrounging around for invites
[00:30:41] <manicennui> I'm currently using 4.65GB at work.
[00:30:54] <manicennui> 63GB for personal.
[00:31:13] <manicennui> Oh, sorry, that is all Google services.
[00:31:18] <manicennui> Most of that is Google Drive.
[00:31:54] <manicennui> Less than 2GB of that is mail.

[00:33:01] <indigo> ~4GB here for email
[00:35:01] <indigo> I do wish personal Gmail accounts had the ability to ttl stuff
[00:39:02] <manicennui> Back in the day your PST file grew huge and Outlook crashed.
[00:41:20] <indigo> Oh I am very intimate with large PST files
[00:41:32] <indigo> Back in college I had a part time job doing IT/web dev
[00:41:44] <indigo> One time we had to migrate huge PSTs to Gmail
[00:41:54] <manicennui> Fun!
[00:42:01] <indigo> One dude had a 30GB PST...
[00:42:31] <indigo> And of course no one wanted to lose their old emails
[00:42:40] <manicennui> I started as an assistant sys admin at a smaller company, which really meant that I had to deal with anything computer related.

[00:54:53] <gwozniak> Thinking something similar, to be honest

[00:56:20] <companion_cube> ah shit, already posted
[00:56:27] <manicennui> LOTR is definitely my favorite film franchise at this point.
[00:56:35] <manicennui> I don't include the Hobbit films in that.
[00:57:12] <gwozniak> I wathed the first Hobbit movie and did not keep watching
[00:57:20] <gwozniak> It was way too drawn out
[00:57:37] <manicennui> companion_cube: How many people mistake the OCaml logo for Perl?
[00:57:50] <manicennui> gwozniak: I definitely haven't seen all three. I can't remember whether I saw the second one.
[00:58:23] <manicennui> Not really looking forward to Amazon's series.
[01:01:43] <companion_cube> manicennui: good question
[01:01:49] <companion_cube> it's a double hump caml tho
[01:02:34] <manicennui> They are definitely different, but I bet a lot of people aren't even aware of OCaml and don't really know what its logo looks like.
[01:03:48] <companion_cube> I don't know if the two crowds intersect much, anyway
[01:09:35] <gerikson> this HN thinks tehre are similarities https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15840544

[01:10:38] <manicennui> companion_cube: I meant more if some random software developer saw the OCaml logo.
[01:10:51] <companion_cube> oh, I guess they'd know neither perl's nor ocaml's
[01:11:19] <companion_cube> gerikson: some criticism is valid
[01:11:23] <companion_cube> the "let" one is just bad though.
[01:11:28] <companion_cube> like, fuck SML
[01:11:41] <companion_cube> it's just not as good as OCaml in 2021
[01:12:06] <imode> show me somethin' that's neat about OCaml.
[01:12:14] <manicennui> Is OCaml as good as F#? =P
[01:12:20] <companion_cube> imode: I mean :D
[01:12:28] <imode> yes, that is a legitimate request.
[01:12:29] <companion_cube> the pattern matching is kind of unrivaled, for example.
[01:12:38] <imode> what would you say is the coolest feature.
[01:12:39] <companion_cube> you can match almost *anything*
[01:13:23] <companion_cube> hmmm, it's a very pragmatic ML, not sure what pops up the most
[01:13:59] <companion_cube> I'd still say that there's a very clean set of types with a symmetry between construction and matching
[01:14:04] <companion_cube> that's really sweet
[01:14:17] <companion_cube> (if you like ML that is)
[01:24:26] <drakonis> manicennui: that's a yes.

[01:25:50] <imode> hello fellow nerd.
[01:25:57] <imode> I have been equal amounts of bad and good.
[01:26:56] <Xe> thinking about getting a copy of beat saber for my quest so i can load it up with all my custom songs and have a copy of all of that when i travel
[01:27:41] <Brekkjern> I'm just imagining someone sitting in a secluded corner of an airport, VR goggles on their face, and waving their arms around

[01:28:45] <Xe> i don't mean for while i'm directly in-travel :P
[01:28:57] <Brekkjern> I know, but the mental image was too good not to share :P
[01:29:04] <Xe> mostly for hotel rooms
[01:29:15] <ngoldbaum> definitely save it for sitting in the middle seat on a plane
[01:29:18] <manicennui> They won't even hear the cops coming when they tackle them.
[01:31:24] <drakonis> there's a range of things that ocaml has that you can't get with f#
[01:32:19] <Brekkjern> Speaking of FP, I got a C on my exam.
[01:32:30] <Xe> but yeah, it'd also be a good companion to my steam deck, put windows on an SD card and then I can have PCVR on the go lol

[01:35:37] <Brekkjern> Is hotel internet good enough for that kind of stuff?
[01:35:49] <Brekkjern> Usually it's pretty shit in my experience
[01:36:19] <drakonis> Brekkjern: weak
[01:36:28] <Brekkjern> drakonis: ?
[01:36:56] <drakonis> im just being dumb about the C on fp
[01:37:07] <Brekkjern> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[01:37:15] <drakonis> im a shit
[01:37:20] <Brekkjern> It's average. I was hoping for a B, but... eh

[01:37:47] <ngoldbaum> overachiever
[01:37:59] <Brekkjern> Heh

[01:38:14] <Xe> Brekkjern: vrchat is actually surprisingly low bandwidth
[01:38:22] <Xe> it's mostly positional data and voice
[01:38:25] <Brekkjern> Xe: Yeah, but latency?
[01:38:38] <Church> Brekkjern: Lemme go get you a vid of this dude Beat Sabering in an airport at like 3am then. Janitor just sweeps around the guy.
[01:39:10] <Church> Xe: How is the Quest? Been thinking of getting one for a while.
[01:39:15] <drakonis> what's the deal with scala again?
[01:39:17] <Brekkjern> Church: lol. I can imagine :P
[01:39:24] <Church> Probably hold off and get something with good Linux compat
[01:39:43] <Church> I keep meaning to fiddle with letoram's arcan VR WM again.
[01:40:07] <manicennui> Brekkjern got a C for "stick with C". =P
[01:40:09] <drakonis> which gpu do you have?
[01:40:10] <Church> On my old Oculus CV1
[01:40:10] <manicennui> drakonis: What about it?
[01:40:21] <Church> drakonis: That to me?
[01:40:23] <drakonis> yeah
[01:40:46] <drakonis> now, as for scala, i was a bit curious about it after remembering that the community and language sucks and wanted to know why
[01:41:34] <mouseghost> hewooo
[01:41:52] <Church> drakonis: Intel in this laptop
[01:41:53] <drakonis> henlo
[01:41:56] <Church> Other one is nvidia
[01:41:57] <drakonis> oh, intel, nice.
[01:43:28] <manicennui> drakonis: As far as I can tell, some people are upset that some people in the Scala community won't denounce some other members of the Scala community who are mostly just assholes.
[01:43:56] <drakonis> the language also seems like a goddamn hot awful mess
[01:44:24] <manicennui> I'm not a huge fan, but it seems to appeal to people who want to be writing Haskell but want to be employed.
[01:45:04] <drakonis> scala 3.0 exists but its still in that spot where it wants to do everything but it does none of them well
[01:45:09] <manicennui> Some of its Ruby-like syntax is a bit appealing, but it has tons, and tons of syntax.
[01:45:44] <ngoldbaum> scala has a lot of people who like right wing (or even far-right) politics involved in the community
[01:45:57] <manicennui> It feels like a language where they just add every feature that seems interesting without any kind of overall elegant design.
[01:46:03] <drakonis> if i remember correctly, even the creator is an asshole
[01:46:19] <Brekkjern> Everyone is an asshole if you look closely enough
[01:46:23] <ngoldbaum> lambdaconf also similarly fash-adjacent
[01:46:32] <ngoldbaum> lots of overlap in that croud
[01:47:04] <drakonis> something something fp programmers?

[02:15:39] <indigo> Brekkjern: Is a C as terrible as it is in the US?
[02:15:54] <Brekkjern> indigo: No. It's the average.
[02:16:03] <Brekkjern> A-E are passing grades.
[02:16:06] <indigo> Oh is this ECTS
[02:16:17] <Brekkjern> I have no idea what the system is called
[02:17:17] <Brekkjern> You have to average a C if you want to get into a master
[02:17:33] <Brekkjern> So it's good enough for now
[02:18:04] <indigo> I'm looking online, and it looks like a C roughly maps to a B in the US grading system
[02:18:09] <indigo> Good work man!!!
[02:18:24] <Brekkjern> Thanks. I was hoping for a B though :P
[02:18:41] <Brekkjern> I thought I did rather well, so...
[02:18:55] <indigo> Maybe you can convince your professor to adopt another grading Scheme
[02:19:25] <Brekkjern> lol
[02:20:46] <Brekkjern> I asked for the reasoning for the grade. Will have to see if I have a case for a complaint or not.

[02:50:59] <indigo> Ok good
[02:51:06] <imode> ...on a weekend.
[02:52:08] <mouseghost> uh read about statistical arbitrage... they say hedge funds use it... but argh its complicated
[02:52:35] <imode> stat arb is simple if you speak ook ook nft monkey speak

[02:52:55] <mouseghost> i dont speak nft speak ;c

[02:53:49] <imode> dilDAO manufacturing.
[02:53:59] <imode> mouseghost: why are you looking up stat arb.
[02:54:13] <mouseghost> imode, ive heard hedge funds, who make money out of thin air, use it
[02:54:24] <mouseghost> and uhh i want to get trading or some shit
[02:54:42] <imode> as someone who made money, don't.
[02:54:43] <mouseghost> but apparently just borrowing money gives you 20% apy just like that so ugh
[02:54:49] <mouseghost> why dont ;-;
[02:55:01] <imode> because it's basically gambling.
[02:55:22] <mouseghost> but there are techniques that are low riskkk
[02:55:30] <imode> yeah. stuff your shit into VOO.
[02:55:35] <mouseghost> whats voo
[02:56:07] <imode> vanguard's S&P 500 fund.
[02:57:27] <mouseghost> for real?
[02:57:50] <imode> yes.
[02:57:57] <mouseghost> but ugh i had that dream that i made a lot more just by trading shit quickly or something
[02:58:04] <mouseghost> doing said stat arb or something
[02:58:07] <imode> that's how you lose money.
[02:58:12] <mouseghost> :_:
[02:58:42] <imode> here's how you trade. you get up in the early morning, you look at a precisely tuned scanner during premarket, you see what's moving and what's not, what's hit premarket highs and what hasn't.
[02:59:09] <imode> you then wait and watch after market open for any movement on maybe 1 or 2 securities.
[02:59:21] <imode> and you catch things as they rise.
[02:59:25] <imode> and sell off as they fall.
[02:59:37] <mouseghost> whats a scanner
[02:59:56] <imode> something that mines the stock exchanges for information.
[03:00:05] <martian67> don't go into this thinking you are gonna rake in crazy amounts of money
[03:00:15] <martian67> and that its easy, and predictable
[03:00:30] <imode> unless you use a stupid fucking amount of leverage, the amount of money you'd need to make what you're thinking about is an amount you do not have.
[03:00:35] <martian67> if it was easy and predictable, it would get piled into massively until it wasn't profitable
[03:00:56] <mouseghost> .W.
[03:01:07] <imode> I had a former friend of mine puke for a couple of days after he accidentally leveraged up to like 50x.
[03:01:15] <martian67> day trading on average does not beat the market
[03:01:16] <imode> he was playing with hundreds of thousands of dollars and made out alright.
[03:01:26] <imode> but if he made that wrong call he'd uh, be fucked.
[03:01:33] <martian67> because its an iterative game with everyone playing off each other
[03:02:03] <imode> the adage of timing vs. time-in is 100% true.
[03:02:10] <imode> go throw shit into funds if you want.
[03:02:15] <imode> ..stay away from crypto.
[03:02:19] <martian67> just stick it in an ETF like vangaurd and stop thinking about it, feel free to have some money to play with
[03:02:26] <martian67> do not fuck around with money you actually need
[03:02:37] <martian67> that is a recepie for going broke
[03:02:49] <mouseghost> .W.
[03:03:19] <martian67> and as imode said
[03:03:30] <martian67> knowing something will rise or fall hardly means anything at all
[03:03:34] <martian67> its 100% about timing
[03:03:39] <martian67> if you can't time it, it doesn't matter
[03:03:56] <imode> uh, that's actually the opposite of what I'm advocating.
[03:04:11] <imode> unless I'm reading you wrong. being there prior to the move is more important than being there for the move.
[03:04:26] <martian67> yes thats an aspect of timing
[03:04:41] <imode> if you already had investments and the market went boom boom pow, then you're golden. if you didn't, then do not try to "time out" the next boom, you will end up with losses.
[03:04:45] <imode> time in the market beats timing the market.
[03:05:08] <martian67> ah i see what you are saying
[03:05:29] <martian67> i was refering to short term day trading like stratigeys, you are talking about long term whole market investing
[03:05:33] <imode> yes.
[03:05:41] <martian67> and i agree, thats a much better idea in general
[03:05:47] <imode> because day trading doesn't beat that.
[03:05:52] <imode> it just hooks gamblers.
[03:05:54] <martian67> im saying to make day trading work, timing is critical
[03:06:18] <martian67> everyone with a brain knows for instance tesla is absurdly overvalued
[03:06:19] <imode> 100%. you have to be up prior to market open and watch for things like the lunch rush, breakouts, etc.
[03:06:39] <martian67> but if you can't time its collapse, you can lose a literally unlimited amount of money
[03:06:47] <martian67> off trying to play it with shorts/options
[03:06:56] <imode> I refuse to touch options.
[03:06:59] <martian67> richer people that any of us have done so
[03:07:07] <martian67> and lost billions
[03:07:11] <defect> gimme voo/vti any day of the week. my poor heart can't take anything else
[03:07:21] <imode> I used to day trade and it got me a ton of money.
[03:07:30] <mouseghost> ahhh im so anxious about it
[03:07:31] <imode> I would never do it again.
[03:07:35] <imode> ever.
[03:07:48] <martian67> yep, the risk of ruin is real
[03:08:01] <martian67> especially if you leverage to all fuck to get returns off tiny movements
[03:08:17] <martian67> because unexpected things happen, the roulette wheel can and does land on 0....
[03:08:22] <mouseghost> soo uhhh is $200 okay amount to put into vanguards sp500?
[03:08:24] <imode> 50x leverage or a bullet in the head.
[03:08:29] <imode> which would you choose.
[03:08:46] <imode> if it's the latter you're probably sane.
[03:08:52] <imode> mouseghost: do not buy fractional shares.
[03:08:59] <mouseghost> i wont
[03:09:02] <mouseghost> ill buy vanguard etf
[03:09:07] <mouseghost> it will be uhhh
[03:09:12] <mouseghost> like 2 shares i guess
[03:09:15] <imode> huh?

[03:09:25] <martian67> mouseghost:  if you are ok with completely losing $200 without a trace, feel free to day trade, but watch yourself
[03:09:30] <imode> VOO is $432.64.
[03:09:40] <mouseghost> oh
[03:09:41] <martian67> do not fool yourself into thinking you are smart just because you made money
[03:09:43] <imode> VTI is $240.67.
[03:09:47] <mouseghost> maybe we are looking at different things then
[03:09:58] <mouseghost> are we talking about ETFs or what
[03:09:58] <martian67> there are multiple vangaurd ETFs
[03:10:01] <imode> yeah.
[03:10:09] <ngoldbaum> VOO is the main s&p 500 etf
[03:10:16] <imode> which funds do you want.
[03:10:44] <mouseghost> i was looking at this one, i think https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/rs/gre/gls/1.3.0/documents/6017/gb
[03:11:12] <mouseghost> ah
[03:11:27] <imode> that's VOO.
[03:12:03] <mouseghost> then im not sure where the price discrepancy would appear
[03:12:05] <mouseghost> from
[03:12:40] <ngoldbaum> no that’s vusa
[03:12:49] <ngoldbaum> $66.60 atm
[03:13:47] <mouseghost> and do i have to wait for the price to fall into more favorable spot?
[03:15:01] <ngoldbaum> not if you’re investing on a long enough timescale
[03:15:01] <mouseghost> ngoldbaum, i think thats in pounds
[03:15:08] <mouseghost> is one year long enough?
[03:15:20] <ngoldbaum> you’re right
[03:15:47] <ngoldbaum> i wouldn’t invest in something correlated with the stock market on such a short timescale
[03:16:02] <mouseghost> i was weirded out because i would be buying on EAM, as i have it free there, and the price is like 79 eur
[03:16:06] <mouseghost> oh
[03:16:06] <mouseghost> hm
[03:16:17] <mouseghost> on the other hand, its just for a try...
[03:16:21] <mouseghost> maybe i should give it a try...
[03:16:30] <mouseghost> but its a lot of monies ;-;
[03:16:53] <ngoldbaum> the stock market as a whole only tends to increase in value over several-decade timescales
[03:16:56] <ngoldbaum> just empirically
[03:17:06] <mouseghost> hm
[03:17:28] <ngoldbaum> so on year timescales you expose yourself to short-term risk of a financial crisis, you want something with lower beta
[03:19:02] <ngoldbaum> or otoh yolo invest it in nfts
[03:23:05] <mouseghost> nuuu
[03:23:14] <mouseghost> i dont even understand nfts so maybe lets not go that way haha
[03:23:30] <mouseghost> ok so ive placed the order
[03:28:14] <mouseghost> aaaaaaaaaaaa
[03:28:16] <mouseghost> meow meow
[03:28:26] <mouseghost> on the other hand, its better than just having the money lay around
[03:28:35] <mouseghost> especially with the inflation being high
[03:33:13] <bkero> why arent you buying SHMP?
[03:33:26] <bkero> shrimp is the future!

[22:35:19] <imode> listen I don't have to strongly type my holiday cheer.
[22:35:22] <ngoldbaum> does that count ^
[22:35:26] <ngoldbaum> not too polite…
[22:35:40] * imode donks ngoldbaum.
[22:35:44] <imode> holiday donk.
[22:38:18] <jjuran> Gentlemen, you can't celebrate now — this is a major holiday!
[22:38:33] <companion_cube> no fighting in the war room!
[22:38:42] <jjuran> :-)
[22:38:56] <ngoldbaum> you can’t let pushcx in here, he might see the map!
[22:47:22] <Church> Heh
[22:47:36] <Church> I've somehow never seen that movie despite owning a copy.
[22:47:41] <Church> Should watch over my vacation
[22:48:45] <indigo> I’ve been watching more Witcher :) s2 is solid so far
[22:48:46] <jjuran> Same here :-P
[22:49:07] <jjuran> Having a copy of Dr. Strangelove but not having seen it yet, that is
[22:49:11] <indigo>  apparently the games are on sale
[22:50:32] <imode> jjuran: Church: precious. bodily. fluids.
[22:59:17] <gwozniak> Church: I've had a copy of The Simpsons Movie for nearly 15 years and I've still never watched it
[22:59:26] <Church> Heh
[22:59:33] <Church> It's alright
[22:59:38] <gwozniak> So I know the feeling :)
[22:59:51] <gwozniak> There.  Done with my wife's gift.
[23:00:35] <gwozniak> I always discourage us giving each other gifts, but she always gets me things so I give in and get her stuff that I don't have to go out and shop for
[23:01:11] <gwozniak> But things like tickets to interesting art exhibits have been tricky the past two years...
[23:01:17] <ngoldbaum> rip spiderpig
