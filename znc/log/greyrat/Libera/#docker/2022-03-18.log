[00:27:19] <larsks> BSaboia: Do you have an example? Do you mean there are multiple command: keys on a single service? 
[00:27:36] <BSaboia> larsks, exactly
[00:29:24] <larsks> If you have something like https://gist.github.com/larsks/6401a3d97186143767d6298c254f22a1, that's broken. Only the final `command` will matter.
[00:32:37] <BSaboia> OK, that's what I thought. But this is also invalid YAML (to have duplicate keys). I wonder why `docker-compose` is not complaining about it
[00:32:41] <BSaboia> Maybe that asks for a PR
[00:33:12] <BSaboia> It is also better to fail if you have such than to have an uncanny behavior
[00:33:14] <tianon> mike18: the first will only try to stop a container named exactly "$(CONTAINER_NAME)-$(ENV)" but the latter will try to stop all containers with "$(CONTAINER_NAME)-$(ENV)" anywhere in their name
[00:33:30] <mike18> all?
[00:33:46] <mike18> which one stops all?
[00:34:30] <tianon> in "docker ps", "-a" is "even stopped containers", "-q" is "list container IDs only", and "-f" is "use the following filter" and the filter provided is filtering for containers whose name includes the text
[00:34:42] <tianon> the resulting list of IDs is then passed to "docker stop" (in the second example)
[00:35:06] <tianon> that could also be written as: docker ps -aqf "name=$(CONTAINER_NAME)-$(ENV)" | xargs -r docker stop
[00:35:17] <tianon> if you wanted something that used more pure shell instead of Make's $(shell ...) construct
[00:35:23] <tianon> (I'm going to assume Make, given the syntax)
[00:35:45] <mike18> what do you suggest to run to only stop the current running docker?
[00:35:58] <mike18> i use make
[00:36:06] <tianon> that depends a lot on what you mean by "the current running docker"
[00:36:09] <mike18> just: docker stop $(CONTAINER_NAME)-$(ENV) ?
[00:36:17] <mike18> i do a docker run
[00:36:23] <mike18> and than want to stop that docker 
[00:36:26] <tianon> I'm assuming you have some other make target that starts a container with "--name $(CONTAINER_NAME)-$(ENV)" ?
[00:36:31] <mike18> to gracefully shut down it :)
[00:36:39] <mike18> env is the target
[00:36:49] <mike18> but there should only be one docker per env running
[00:36:51] <tianon> yeah, just docker stop $(CONTAINER_NAME)-$(ENV) should be plenty if you're using "--name $(CONTAINER_NAME)-$(ENV)" in your run
[00:37:10] <mike18> i thought giving it the specific pid is good :)
[00:37:15] <tianon> and has less chance of accidentally catching something you didn't expect, if your values for CONTAINER_NAME and/or ENV are ever ambiguous
[00:37:55] *** Joins: atille_ (~atille@195.15.242.101)
[00:37:59] <tianon> like if ENV has "dev" and "devqa" as possible values, when you "docker ps -aqf "name=$(CONTAINER_NAME)-$(ENV)"" you will catch "devqa" also when ENV is set to "dev"
[00:38:14] <tianon> so you definitely just want by name - let Docker figure out the container ID
[00:38:36] <tianon> if you really want the ID of just that one container, you probably want something with "docker container inspect --format"
[00:38:45] <mike18> it will stop dev and devqa - both?
[00:38:50] <tianon> yes
[00:38:53] <mike18> oh dang
[00:38:57] <mike18> how to fix it?
[00:39:02] <tianon> get rid of "docker ps" there
[00:39:06] <tianon> and use your first option instead
[00:39:12] <mike18> ok
[00:39:13] <tianon> since it's only one container you actually want to stop
[00:39:33] <tianon> (no need for "ps" unless you're trying to match more than one container, or a container whose name you don't know the entirety of)
[00:39:50] <mike18> true
[00:39:52] <mike18> sorry
[00:40:45] <mike18> tianon: another thing
[00:40:55] <mike18> when is docker nativly available for mac m1? :)
[00:41:19] <DoofusCanadensis> it is currently available
[00:41:26] <tianon> yeah, for a while now :)

[00:41:38] <tianon> https://www.docker.com/blog/released-docker-desktop-for-mac-apple-silicon/
[00:41:41] <mike18> i mean without install-rosetta :)
[00:41:55] <mike18> install-rosetta is additional layer
[00:41:57] <DoofusCanadensis> I don't have it using rosetta
[00:42:04] <mike18> its costs speed
[00:42:07] <mike18> thats the issue
[00:42:15] <tianon> > There are a few optional command line tools that still require Rosetta 2 when using Darwin/AMD64.
[00:42:19] <mike18> you say its released without install-rosetta ?
[00:42:36] <DoofusCanadensis> that's what those links say, yes
[00:42:37] <tianon> if you want "docker-compose" v1, "docker scan", or "docker-credential-ecr-login", you need rosetta
[00:42:40] <tianon> otherwise, you do not
[00:42:46] <tianon> (it's all on that docs link)
[00:42:49] <mike18> ok
[00:42:59] <mike18> but i guess its just a question if time
[00:43:09] <mike18> until its running all without install-rosetta
[00:43:11] <tianon> if you're ok with "docker compose" (which is v2) and do not need those other two, you do not need rosetta
[00:43:21] <mike18> dont need docker componse
[00:43:27] <mike18> docker run is ok :)
[00:43:40] <DoofusCanadensis> then you're in luck... since last april
[00:43:45] <mike18> ok
[00:43:48] <mike18> will try it

[17:10:36] <Anticom> Hi folks. I'm struggling with cron jobs inside docker container. My image is based on alpine and it contains crond from BusyBox. I've placed a file in /etc/cron.d but no matter what I do, I don't get anything logged to stdout. Problem is I'm not sure whether crond isn't processing the file or if there's something wrong with the logging aspect of things.

[17:31:18] <GyrosGeier> Anticom, is cron actually running?
[17:31:26] <GyrosGeier> I mean, that would be the obvious problem
[17:31:57] <GyrosGeier> also, traditional (Vixie) cron will log to syslog by default
[17:32:53] <ikke> in any case, crond does not output the scripts stdout to its stdout
[17:33:10] <GyrosGeier> and stdout/stderr from commands it runs are collected and emailed, to the user name listed in the crontab (or the owner of the user crontab) @ the machine hostname
[17:33:11] <ikke> But for crond to work in docker, you need to run it in the foreground

[17:36:07] <Anticom> GyrosGeier: Sorry for late response. Yes it is running, I've set it as cmd in my Container spec and got ["-l", "2", "-f"] as my args.
[17:36:18] <tabakhase> Anticom "do you rly need a cron" is Q1, - so do yu want a task run AT a point -- or is "a task run every X-time-units" fine too? (then you can get away just with docker restarts, or even a "sleep 23hours" in a shellscript ;D
[17:36:49] <Anticom> tabakhase: Yes, We've got about 30 deployments right now that spawn a job each and every minute which is putting unwanted load on the scheduler
[17:36:59] <tabakhase> Anticom other "hack", define your crons as "* * * *.... bla.sh >/proc/1/fd/1 2>&1"  - this way it will inject the output to pid1, what should be crontab, and therefor docker
[17:37:08] <GyrosGeier> oof
[17:37:35] <tabakhase> note that it folds stdout&err tho...
[17:38:30] <tabakhase> one can prob build a wrapper to get both streams addressed correctly too i guess...
[17:41:04] <tabakhase> (the nice part in "switching to run a job X unit after last ended" is also you dont have to mess with locking :P -- BUT it ofc. makes the schedule unrely/predict/able - whats rly fine for 99% of the things ;D)
[17:42:20] <tabakhase> maybe not good for the monthly datacruncher job :D - but just fine for generic "housekeeping every few minutes"

[22:03:37] <genio> I've got what seems like a very stupid/silly problem going on with Windows containers. If I don't provide a WORKDIR= and copy a powershell script over to be run, there are no problems. However, if I try to set a WORKDIR or create a directory or anything directly IN the dockerfile, it dies with: encountered an error during hcsshim::System::CreateProcess: failure in a Windows system call: The directory name is invalid. (0x10b)
[22:04:13] <genio> The only thing I've found thus far is that I should prune everything because I'm out of space. That doesn't seem to be the problem as there are no errors with a powershell script using up lots of space.
[22:04:39] <genio> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/TOtknphB/  If anyone can spot my stupid and help me, that'd be great
[22:04:41] <minimal> lantech19446: if you're using a busybox base image (i.e. it only contains busybox) then yes, how would you update it if there's no package manager of any sort installed in the image?
[22:05:45] <lantech19446> minimal: I didn't know there wasn't until I tried
[22:05:51] <minimal> a busybox-only base image is lightwight precisely because it does not contain things like a package manager - if you want that then choose another base image
[22:06:16] <lantech19446> I only have it because it was the first exercise in my course
[22:07:35] <minimal> you could use something an alpine base container with is the next "level" up - its based around Busybox and musl C library but with "apk" as a package manager
[22:07:51] <minimal> s/an /like a/
[22:08:07] <lantech19446> apk as in android packages?
[22:08:17] <ikke> alpine package manager
[22:08:31] <minimal> nope, Alpine Package Manager - clash of acronyms
[22:08:37] <lantech19446> o ok
[22:08:48] <lantech19446> I've tried a lot of distros but never tried alpine
[22:09:06] <minimal> both myself and ikke here are Alpine people :-)
[22:09:24] <ikke> :)
[22:09:45] <lantech19446> I was using arch for a while but at this point i've settled on rhel
[22:10:27] <minimal> ikke: for some reason that Sound of Music song "Climb every mountain" just jumped into my head ;-)
[22:11:53] <ikke> he
[22:14:07] <genio> nevermind. I'm an idiot
