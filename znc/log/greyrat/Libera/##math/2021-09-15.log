[00:52:23] <CuriousErnestBro> why does measure theory make everything complicated >.>
[00:53:10] <isekaijin> No idea, but measure theory is special among areas of mathematics in that regard...
[00:53:14] <isekaijin> is not*
[00:54:41] <CuriousErnestBro> we're studying martingales this week, and they have a thing called F_n called a filtration of all the random variables until time n. A filtration is a sigma algebra, which, as how I understand it, is the set of all (open?) subsets of an interval (when dealing with continuous-time processes)
[00:54:46] *** Quits: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
[00:56:02] <CuriousErnestBro> the interpretation of F_n as being "the information contained in random variables until time n" is vague
[00:56:47] <CuriousErnestBro> They define conditional expectations as being F_n measurable, which, ok, you can't integrate over infinitely many random variables, sure.
[00:57:00] <CuriousErnestBro> But a sigma algebra is even bigger than the sample space of a random variable!
[00:57:04] <CuriousErnestBro> so how does that solve anything
[00:57:06] *** Joins: nicbk (~nicbk@user/nicbk)
[00:57:38] <isekaijin> A filtration is a sigma-algebra? That does not seem right. :-|
[00:58:02] <CuriousErnestBro> this is from memory
[00:58:13] <CuriousErnestBro> so I may be wrong
[00:58:47] <CuriousErnestBro> oh, filtration is a collection of sigma. algebra's
[00:58:58] <isekaijin> Normally a filtration of a thing is a family of subthings parametrized by a directed set (the inclusions of subthings have to be consistent with the directed set, of course) or something like that.
[00:59:01] <CuriousErnestBro> that's nesting
[00:59:36] <CuriousErnestBro> so {F_n} is a filtration with n in T (index set)
[01:00:05] <isekaijin> Maybe the only case you care about is where the directed set is actually a linear order. Since that models “time”.
[01:00:47] <CuriousErnestBro> what's a linear order?
[01:00:52] <qergle> but martingales are fun!
[01:01:15] <CuriousErnestBro> qergle martin gales is just the efficient market hypothesis but in math
[01:02:02] <CuriousErnestBro> I guess I'll just ignore the measure theory part
[01:02:08] <CuriousErnestBro> I don't think my uni cares, they just mention it to "be complete" I guess
[01:03:42] <CuriousErnestBro> I'll probably be fine if I treat F_n = {X_1, ..., X_n}
[01:04:08] <qergle> ok, am i wrong here.
[01:05:23] <qergle> say we have a σ-algebra B. if we have a sequence of σ-algebras B₀,B₁,... st B₀ ⊂ B₁ ⊂ ... ⊂ B, then this sequence is a "filtration"
[01:05:41] <qergle> specifically a B-filtration
[01:06:38] *** Parts: diophantoz (~diophanto@user/diophantoz) (Leaving)
[01:07:37] <CuriousErnestBro> I see, what's a sigma algebra anyways? "the smallest set of all subsets and their complements of the sample space", if the sample space is [0,1] this set is infinitely large right?
[01:07:39] <isekaijin> Mmm, the question I would ask is - when we define a probability measure on B later on, do we need to impose some conditions on it to be “consistent” with the filtration?
[01:08:02] <CuriousErnestBro> it's the set of all open, closed, and half-open intervals?
[01:08:19] <isekaijin> CuriousErnestBro: A sigma-algebra is a family of subsets of B that is closed under countable unions (in particular, the nullary union is the empty set) and complementation.
[01:08:27] <isekaijin> Errr, subsets of X
[01:08:37] <CuriousErnestBro> and all of their combinations too? or is that taken care of by the probability measure?
[01:10:02] <CuriousErnestBro> closed under countable unions = take any union of subsets of the sample space, that is in the sigma algebra?
[01:10:02] <isekaijin> In principle, a sigma-algebra does not have to be related to a topology, so I have no idea why you mention open sets.
[01:10:51] <isekaijin> Of course, the Borel sigma-algebra, which is generated by the topology of R^n, is an example of a sigma-algebra. But it is just that - an example.
[01:11:05] <CuriousErnestBro> I mention the interval [0,1] as an example, this is very vague without one
[01:13:43] <qergle> maybe it would be nice to revisit this with the measure theory level set to "low"

[03:09:34] <droid3> Some books define an algebraic variety be irreducible so that is not the union of two smaller sets that are closed in the Zariski topology.
[03:10:04] <droid3> But really algebraic sets and algebraic varieties leaving off that debate of definition are the same.
[03:11:48] <droid3> scheme are really just generalizations of algebraic varieties that take multiplicity into account. Because multiplicity can get difficult to keep track of with algebraic varieties.
[03:12:26] <droid3> i can see defining / using that.
[03:13:07] <droid3> But my issue is all over the place definitions and stuff for genus of curves , surfaces , hypersurface , manifolds ,...etc

[03:19:24] <droid3> Sure you can understand specific genus , deg , dim definition like in a standard undergraduate or even alot of most grad level course. No problem.

[03:21:06] <droid3> I guess the really question is how general do we make these concepts before they are meaningless or lose any mathematical appeal or problem appeal to solve.
[03:21:47] <droid3> Like genus do we want it to mean the number of holes of things then that only applies to certain geometrical object capable of using holes.
[03:22:18] <droid3> If we define deg is it the degree of a polynomial , the degree of a continous map , manifold ...etc
[03:23:20] <droid3> With so much abstraction / generalization it hard at times to see the connection and even hard to appreciate trying to solve a problem after you decipher what it actually means.
[03:24:48] <droid3> I suppose generalizing dim , deg , and genus so they incorporate all special case definitions one has from undergraduate or begining grad level course is fine.

[03:38:51] <droid3> maybe talking on hyperelliptic curves and more general topics of algebraic groups with g>3 that would have nice abelian group addition properties you can define like elliptic or hyperelliptical curves. Would be more interesting to most because the applications would be for integer factorization and encryption.
[03:39:36] <droid3> we normally just focus on genus 0 or 1 elliptic curves possible genus 2 hyperelliptic curves for factorization/cryptography.
[03:41:43] <droid3> But algebraic varieties is the generalization to all this stuff that contains any additional nice group addition for cool stuff that we havent found yet. Algebraic groups when viewed with polynomials over Fields are always abelian groups so the question becomes is there geometric connections to these groups like the elliptic and hyperelliptic curve we have already laws.

[05:06:57] <biberao> i dont understand how theta is over there
[05:07:30] <cuppajoeman> Because they want their angle to be in the range (-pi, pi]
[05:07:40] <cuppajoeman> You can't represent that angle as something in that range if you go the other direction
[05:08:07] <biberao> but isnt the image wrong?
[05:08:14] <cuppajoeman> I don't think so
[05:08:20] <cuppajoeman> I haven't read the article
[05:08:30] <biberao> but i dont get
[05:08:35] <cuppajoeman> but if you want your angle to be in the range (-pi, pi] you need to measure it that way
[05:08:39] <biberao> ok
[05:08:44] <biberao> but its pi/4
[05:08:51] *** Quits: System123 (~System123@203-134-35-213.sta.estpak.ee) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[05:08:53] <biberao> so how is it there?
[05:09:02] <cuppajoeman> sorry what is pi/4
[05:09:13] <cuppajoeman> oh yeah
[05:09:14] <cuppajoeman> alpha
[05:09:51] <cuppajoeman> that's pi/4 measured against the bottom of the negtive side of the x axis going clockwise
[05:10:09] <biberao> ok
[05:10:26] <cuppajoeman> So actually the angle we are after is pi - pi/4
[05:10:36] <biberao> what about
[05:10:40] <biberao> the  other example then
[05:10:43] <cuppajoeman> which one?
[05:10:47] <biberao> -1+i
[05:10:49] <cuppajoeman> Ok
[05:10:57] <cuppajoeman> So that one is in the 2nd quadrant right
[05:11:04] <cuppajoeman> modelled by a triangle with x = -1 and y = 1
[05:11:06] <biberao> ok le me repost
[05:11:21] <cuppajoeman> So then let's see why arctan doesn't work
[05:11:27] <biberao> here

[05:13:47] <cuppajoeman> yeah looks ok
[05:14:09] <biberao> but then
[05:14:33] <biberao> lets retry -1+i then
[05:14:45] <cuppajoeman> ok
[05:14:46] <biberao> thats tanx=-1
[05:14:53] <cuppajoeman> what is the range you want your output angle to be?
[05:15:03] <biberao> its -pi and pi
[05:15:09] <cuppajoeman> ok
[05:15:26] <cuppajoeman> so x = -1 and y = 1
[05:15:36] <biberao> so its second quadrant
[05:15:59] <cuppajoeman> arctan(1/-1) outputs a number from the range (-pi/2, pi/2)
[05:16:12] <cuppajoeman> therefore the triangle it must represent is one in quadrant 1 or quadrant 4
[05:16:20] <cuppajoeman> since the input is negative it must be in quadrant 4
[05:16:56] <cuppajoeman> so the angle it gives is the one for the triangle in quadrant 4, so that angle is in [0, -pi/2)
[05:17:01] <cuppajoeman> to fix it you add pi

[05:42:24] <isekaijin> In the proof of the Noether normalization lemma, a slightly tricky trick is used, and I am left wondering whether this trick is only necessary when the ground field has positive characteristic.

[05:44:59] <isekaijin> Let K be a field and A = K[x0,...,xn] / I, with I a nonzero ideal. Let f(x0,...,xn) \in I, and d = 1 + (greatest degree of any monomial in f). The claim is that A is integral over K[x0, x1 - x0^a1, ..., xn - x0^an], where ai = d^i for each i = 1,...,n.

[05:46:44] <isekaijin> The trick is to consider g(x0,...,xn) = f(x0, x1 + x0^a1, ..., xn + x0^an) and notice a bunch of things.
[05:47:15] <isekaijin> First, that each term of f contributes a bunch of terms to g.

[05:48:18] <isekaijin> Third, that the powers of x0 arising in this way have different exponents.
[05:48:44] <isekaijin> Now, is the third part only necessary because K might have positive characteristic?
[05:50:40] <isekaijin> Also, before, where I said “A is integral over <blergh>”, I should have said “A is integral over K[x1 - x0^a1, ..., xn - x0^an]”, without x0 as a generator.
[05:52:11] <isekaijin> Errr, no, I just noticed that I had a brain fart. The third part is necessary even in characteristic zero.

[14:10:18] <cadmio> right..
[14:11:20] <cadmio> it seems that here https://imgur.com/pDAmnSP.png it's calling Z_p the symmetric group (which should be S_p)

[14:26:31] <cadmio> so each configuration has 4 twins
[14:27:32] <qergle> each of 5^5-5 configs has 4 twins maybe
[14:28:32] <cadmio> the 5 you're subtracting are those with same colours, isn't it?
[14:28:37] <qergle> yes
[14:29:12] <qergle> those have no twins.
[14:29:37] <qergle> so you overcount by 5 the 5^5-5 others giving (5^5-5)/5 unique and then add in the 5 single color ones

I'm trying to come up with a method to perform QR factorization using rotations instead of reflections; the exercise demands not to look at the literature, so no spoilers please.

However, I'm having trouble figuring out what my rotation matrix should look like. This is w

[19:38:51] <cherim> IF somebody wants to rediscover O(NlogN), tell me about results if any
[19:39:48] <cadmio> 3^6 is the total number of flags but some of them are identical e.g (b, w, r, b, w, r)   and   (r, w, b, r, w, b)

[19:43:09] <Z-module> OK
[19:43:32] <cherim> I's a downgrade from (a, p) necklaces

[19:44:33] <qergle> that flip was horizontal
[19:45:47] <cadmio> for a reflection τ^2 = e so |G| = 2, right?
[19:45:54] <Z-module> yes
[19:47:01] <cadmio> so the number of orbits are s = 1/2 (3^6 + x)

[20:04:29] <cadmio> if you double a 3 string flag you get a 6-stripe, palindrome?
[20:04:39] <cadmio> *stripe
[20:08:39] <cadmio> no it's not e.g. rrg double rrgrrg
[20:09:37] <qergle> double another way
[20:10:40] <cadmio> rrg + grr = rrggrr
[20:14:18] <cadmio> so it's enough to fix 3 places the other 6 are derived by doubling the first 3 and flipping..
[20:15:42] <cadmio> isn't it?

[20:20:12] <cadmio> so 3^3 + 3
[20:20:29] <qergle> why +?
[20:21:00] <cadmio> for the middle position

[21:55:35] <cherim> I got this at national finals for university students when a freshman. Our team had two people in it, my friend (who was a true veteran in math competitions) and me. But we were physics students, so we competed in physics/polytechnic division.
[21:55:46] <cherim> My friend immediately understood what was expected. Tr(A^p) = sum_{i1 ... in} a{i1,i2}a{i2,i3}...a{in,i1}, and the cyclic group Z_p acts on (i1,...,in) necklace. The fixed points correspond to Tr(A)^p, and other orbits yield p identical terms.

Since algebraic closure is algebraically closed, A may be cast to upper-triangular form. Since it has characteristic p, the claim follows from (x1+...+xn)^p=x1^p+...+xn^p, which follows from divisibility of binomial coefficients and induction.
[21:56:16] <cherim> As it turned out, nobody on the jury of the polytechnic division could verify if that argument is valid. They brought an algebraist from another university who confirmed the solution but also demanded that it gets 5 points out of 4.
