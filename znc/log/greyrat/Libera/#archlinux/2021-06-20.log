[01:23:30] <cul8r> nah i dont think so. on the systems ive used with auto mounting drives/flash drives/etc they mount in like a /usrs/media/... path

[08:11:07] <alschaapman> The way I'm remembering it, there was a news bulletin, as there usually is when a normal upgrade requires manual intervention, but maybe I'm just full of it

[08:13:32] <alschaapman> Scimmia: Let me see if I can try to understand what's happened here. `pacman -S archlinux-keyring` followed by `pacman -Syu` did just what I expected it to do
[08:14:10] <alschaapman> So if I'm doing a normal sysupgrade and one of the packages in the transaction is signed with a key that's not part of archlinux-keyring, but the signature is in the new archlinux-keyring that's part of the same transaction, this is just totally normal?

[08:18:10] <alschaapman> But for security reasons, if I want to be sure that I'm not importing a key that shouldn't be trusted, pacman -S archlinux-keyring would be the thing to do there?
[08:18:24] <alschaapman> Followed by continuing the sysupgrade
[08:18:31] <Scimmia> importing the key doesn't trust it. It has to have signatures from 3 of the master keys as well

[08:20:19] <Scimmia> np
[08:21:21] <alschaapman> What exactly is a master key in this context
[08:21:46] <alschaapman> Is this a key held by some Arch packagers or devs that forms a root of trust for the pacman keyring?
[08:21:56] <Scimmia> The Arch master keys are held by various Arch devs to establish the web of trust
[08:22:30] <Scimmia> when you boot the ISO, it generates a local master key, that key is then used to sign the master keys when you install the archlinux-keyring package
[08:23:15] <alschaapman> Ooh I had no idea that the booting of the ISO had this kind of effect on the installed system. Very interesting
[08:23:27] <alschaapman> What if I use the bootstrap image?
[08:24:01] <Scimmia> IIRC, you have to use pacman-key --init in that case
[08:24:10] <oramirite> NetSysFire: thanks for that tip earlier - indeed there are issues setting those variables, probably because the br_netfilter module isn't loaded yet. But I've already tried loading that with /etc/modules-load.d/br_netfilter.conf.....
[08:24:26] <alschaapman> Also you say "various Arch devs." Is this some specific group of devs, and how does that get determined as far as Arch's internal governance?

[12:07:54] <sensille> the amount of knowledge needed for an initial install is quite overwhelming
[12:09:01] <tamiko> sensille: the short answer is that the minimal size of 100 MB for the efi system partition is standardized.
[12:09:46] <tamiko> sensille: but you should still see no IO error when reading from it.
[12:09:50] <sensille> should i redo the installation due to the missing 1mb?
[12:11:08] <tamiko> sensille: Well, 98.6 MiB (base 1024) should be more than 100 MB (base 1000), so probably everything is fine.

[12:14:05] <mpan> I tried to create a FAT32 fs on a 90MB image, with a 4K sector size and mkfs is unahppy. It passes, but (properly) screams at me.

[12:43:34] <mpan> The problem seems to be with ventoy, so unrelated to Arch. But perhaps an alternative solution could be found, using Arch.

[16:55:41] <ayekat> uh... is that new?
[16:56:10] <MacGyver> No, it's done so for ages.
[16:56:14] <ayekat> VMGuy234: they mentioned X keyboard layout :-) (but as MacGyver mentioned, apparently it now also affects the X keyboard layout)
[16:56:32] <MacGyver> Or... I'm *pretty* sure it does?
[16:57:00] <MacGyver> I've had to actually set stuff manually in .xinitrc now but I'm pretty sure that that is solely because xdotool gets confused if I don't.

[22:01:18] <thevinter> Hello! I posted it already in #archlinux-newbie so hope it's fine to repost here as well. I recently installed arch on a new pc and configured my networking trough iwd. Today my internet crashed but once it got back on I lost the ability to connect to the 5Ghz frequency. I can only connect to the 2.4 one. All my other devices work fine so it's an
[22:01:18] <thevinter> Arch's problem. I tried rebooting, I tried restarting iwd, rfkill and I deleted the config in /var/lib/iwd but to no avail. That specific SSID seems to be the only one I can't connect to (wifi-menu has the same problem)
[22:01:56] <thevinter> And by lost the ability to connect to it I mean that iwd simply doesn't see it listed in the available networks

[23:55:23] <horseface> in .profile should i write 'export QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1' or just the 'QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1'?

[23:58:24] <horseface> just edited .profile, can i implement these changes using source ~/.profile or do i have to log out and back in again?
[23:58:53] <sheep> you'll need to log out unless you just want the changes to apply from things launched from this shell session
[23:58:53] <eschwartz> you could just run 'export ...'
[23:59:23] <eschwartz> but yeah, if you want this to apply to a running xorg then you'll need to log out/in
