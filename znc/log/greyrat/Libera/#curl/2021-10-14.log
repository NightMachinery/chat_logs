[11:11:21] <icing> I think starting h3 for apache after my retirement in 10 years is soon enough.
[11:11:58] <bagder> sounds like a plan! =)
[11:12:45] <icing> when the quic apis have stabilized somewwhat.
[11:15:01] <icing> but on a less trollish issue: the rift really has started with akamai+microsoft doing quictls/openssl as a fork. at least, so i read it. as they obviously did not/could not work inside the openssl project.
[11:16:05] <bagder> I think it was also a matter of time. They didn't want to wait for openssl for drag their feet on this
[11:17:05] <icing> yes, they could not work with the project to organize it in a way they needed it. peculiar, since rich$ was what 20? years part of openssl.
[11:18:55] <bagder> yeah, its all rather unfortunate
[11:20:32] <icing> and the situation openssl finds itself in right now is: either they become a quic provider or they will be a patch provider for quictls after distributions switch from one to the other. No need to have 2 openssl in your OS to care about.

[12:05:25] <bagder> its a test exactly how firmly the ecosystem relies on openssl...
[12:13:44] <dege> agreed - and shipping 3.0.0 a year or so late, and then going NIH on quic is for sure a testament how openssl relies on the ecosystem support
[12:14:51] <icing> I would say.
