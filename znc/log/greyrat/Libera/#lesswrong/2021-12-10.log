[00:47:18] <kuudes> that is the thing I plan to put into my air conditioning maybe next summer
[00:48:06] <kuudes> it does not emit ions from the machine, but instead zaps stuff into positive and negative ions inside the machine, which then fall to the cathode and anode as dust
[00:48:40] <kuudes> often it is combined with carbon filters as well, or uv etc

[00:51:12] <gwern> looks like all the fancy stuff centers around the CO2/O2 problem. I guess hepa+carbon just works so well and is used up slowly enough it doesn't merit anything fancier
[00:51:45] <kuudes> ggreer, check genano stuff out

[00:53:56] <gwern> seems like the optimum would be a heat pump+air filter setup which would let you pull in outside air / push out indoor air at minimal heat loss/gain while passing the air through a HEPA+charcol+fancy addons like UV

[00:54:37] <Robomot> What Is an ERV? | UltimateAir (Have you found yourself asking just what is an energy recovery ventilator? Let us clear up the confusion and show why an ERV is valuable for your home.)
[00:54:47] <gwern> ah, is that what they're called?
[00:55:00] <rmmh> yeah, they're in fancy high efficiency homes now
[00:55:11] <kuudes> yeah, they are standard here
[00:55:20] <kuudes> my house also has a preconditioner from geoheat
[00:55:27] <rmmh> you need to have pretty cold winters / hot summers for it to make sense though
[00:55:31] <gwern> outdoor air is always at a reasonable CO2 level unless you've built a house at the bottom of a mine or something, and the heat pup lets you move the large volume of air you need constantly without the naive energy penalty, and then the filtering handles trace gasses, small particles, and airborne viruses
[00:55:36] <kuudes> so it preheats the air on winter and warms the air on summers
[00:55:44] <rmmh> most US home construction is porous enough that you don't have to worry about it
[00:55:53] <gwern> rmmh: hm. maybe you just need to circulate larger volumes
[00:56:18] <kuudes> my house has usually less than 800 ppm, in places where I am not in 450 ppm
[00:56:23] <maplefinger> exchange volume has diminushing returns
[00:56:52] <kuudes> when I put the increased exchange mode on, it gets to <600 ppm where I sit
[00:57:44] <kuudes> main downer has been that I have a good sense of smell and this winter people heat much with wood because electricity market disturbance, so it smells a little of smoke inside
[00:57:53] <kuudes> not much, others don't seem to smell it often
[00:57:57] <gwern> need better filters, I guess

[00:58:08] <gwern> if you can smell it, the activated carbon should be getting it...
[00:58:13] <ggreer> dv2: I mean if you're a 911 operator and someone calls about a chimp killing their friend, the most likely hypothesis is that the caller has gone insane
[00:58:18] <rmmh> smoke is caught by HEPA more than carbon

[00:59:18] <gwern> I'm not sure the smell comes from the large wood particles but ok, then the HEPA should be getting it
[01:00:14] <rmmh> soot has a smell
[01:00:25] <rmmh> I think? or is it other volatiles?
[01:00:47] <ggreer> if a fireplace has a door, I don't think much smoke gets in the room. I only smell smoke when I open the door to put another log in
[01:01:07] <ggreer> also the smoke alarm right next to the fireplace doesn't go off. the carbon monoxide sensor also reads 0

[01:06:30] <kuudes> ah, zvi is as positive as I am?
[01:07:51] <ggreer> I've used it once so far. it's great for parties
[01:08:31] <ggreer> there's something about a warm fire that causes people to congregate around it and interact. and unlike a TV or music, it doesn't distract from the conversation
[01:09:48] <kuudes> the smell is the poison there, it is intoxicant. a little like breathing into a bag or something
[01:10:19] <kuudes> candles also create a lot of particles
[01:10:40] <kuudes> basicly anything burning creates particles enough to be harmful on long term, it seems
[01:11:03] <kuudes> particle exhaust increases chances for heart attacks and brain strokes
[01:11:45] <ggreer> but you only smell the fire when you open the screen
[01:12:15] <ggreer> and the CO2 and smoke alarm next to the fireplace don't trigger (while they do if say... you cook something greasy)
[01:12:29] <ggreer> and forget to turn on the fume hood
[01:12:39] <kuudes> co, not co2?
[01:12:48] <ggreer> oh yeah CO. my bad
[01:13:14] <kuudes> but yeah, particle emissions happen with much lower burns already; candles already produce enough particle emissions to be noticeable afaik
[01:13:25] <kuudes> basicly tl;dr: don't burn anything ever
[01:13:40] <kuudes> but yes, it is very popular to burn things
[01:14:23] <ggreer> I have a candle heater so that one can have the candle smell without the particulates
[01:15:20] <maplefinger> burn cannabis flowers
[01:18:30] <saturn2> ggreer: the fireplace sucks air from the room out the chimney, and the smoke from the chimney is blown away by the wind, which effectively prevents any smoky air from *that* fire from getting into the room. but if the outside air is already smoky from *other* fires, it's a different situation

[04:41:49] <feepbot> The furries also seem more eager to come out of the closet than the gays. Is it all an elaborate joke? An ironic statement of being above outmoded standards of dignity?

[10:08:11] <Guest45654> My mother once tried to convince me that it would be a good thing (for metaphysical reasons?) if all the people in the world died, as long as it happened suddenly and painlessly to all people in the world
[10:08:39] <Guest45654> But even the more gruesome conventional ways of suicide would only bring you a few hours of pain
[10:08:54] <Guest45654> (assuming they succeed, which is a different consideration, and a much more valid one)
[10:09:39] <Guest45654> I mean, regular exercise is painful. I suspect those people are the same people who have a lifelong hostility to exercise
[10:10:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> What a weird take
[10:10:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Pain really sucks

[10:10:40] <Guest45654> Longlasting pain sucks
[10:10:46] <PapuaHardyNet> 'regular exercise is painful' not really, mate
[10:10:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> No, pain sucks, period
[10:10:57] <spxtr> Yeah I'm not a fan of pain for just an hour or two either.
[10:11:07] <spxtr> No pain is clearly better than temporary pain.
[10:11:28] <Guest45654> Also you won't remember the pain, obviously
[10:11:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> So what
[10:11:57] <saturn2> "suicide enthusiasts"?
[10:12:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Wanting to avoid pain is one the most natural and easily comprehensible motivations imaginable
[10:12:32] <Guest45654> saturn2: people who aren't interested in commiting suicide themselves, but like to imagine or design better means for it
[10:12:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's hard to think of something that's *easier* to understand, as a motivation
[10:14:14] <PapuaHardyNet> Guest[random numbers]: I have a list of books on suicide you might want to read to "understand" suicide and suicide enthusiasts
[10:14:36] <Guest45654> If you have a single one and it's not too long then i might read it
[10:14:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Honestly it just doesn't seem the slightest bit confusing or hard to understand at all
[10:14:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> What's weird is *not* understanding it
[10:14:59] <PapuaHardyNet> lol, I'm not ordering you to read it
[10:15:08] <Guest45654> no, feel free to recommend
[10:15:23] <PapuaHardyNet> Anyway, Thomas Joiner's Why People Die by Suicide is the best book I know yet
[10:15:43] <Guest45654> I'm just saying I'm not that interested in the topic that I would read many or very long books on it
[10:15:56] <Guest45654> ok I'll look it up!
[10:18:42] <capisce> at what point does pain become longlasting enough to suck?
[10:19:18] <capisce> exercise isn't that painful
[10:19:58] <Guest45654> There's no obvious threshold, but to my mind, a really bad and painful day can never be THAT bad. Meanwhile old people tend to be absolutely miserable due to neverending low intensity pain, so the threshold runs somewhere between there
[10:21:23] <Guest45654> I guess a part of it is, that a healthy life will have all kinds of experiences in it: happy times and sad times, painful times and unpainful times. People who won't have unpainful times in their lives are the great sufferers imo

[10:26:39] <Obormot\Gaia> Guest45654: If exercise painful, even low-intensity, maybe something is wrong...
[10:27:36] <Guest45654> isn't that the biggest reason people don't exercise as much as they will wish in the future they had?
[10:28:42] <spxtr> no
[10:29:03] <PapuaHardyNet> doing pullups feels pretty good
[10:29:07] <Guest45654> most people, I think, wish they had exercised more in the recent past, without channeling that thought into exercising more for the future
[10:29:24] <spxtr> that's not because exercise literally hurts, in most cases

[11:20:48] <kuudes> human differences
[11:21:10] <kuudes> I am in the understanding that for many people excercise is much more saliently bad-feeling/painful than for other people
[11:22:49] <capisce> probably they're pushing too hard, too fast
[11:23:17] <kuudes> not even tha
[11:23:30] <kuudes> for instance I think I am rather unsalient for endorphines
[11:23:43] <kuudes> I presume I would not like heroin much either
[11:23:56] <capisce> so no kind of movement feels pleasant?
[11:24:01] <kuudes> about so, yes
[11:24:20] <kuudes> some people can imagine stripes on tigers, some can't. human variety is large
[11:25:05] <kuudes> I am good at sitting still, animals trust me on that :)
[11:25:07] <capisce> could be that there's some threshold effect, where if you're below a certain level of fitness exercise feels unpleasant
[11:25:39] <kuudes> I don't know. I don't feel it that odd that there can be people who just won't feel pleasure from exericise
[11:25:50] <capisce> let's hope fitness can come in the form of a pill one day

[12:05:58] <PapuaHardyNet> meth is the real fitness pill. also motivates you to workout, so you actually gain muscle
[12:07:51] <ggreer> meth was used by the germans in the 1940s and they accomplished quite a bit in that time. it's hard to argue with results
[12:08:20] <saturn2> elon musk and jeff bezos are taking the fitness pills

[12:21:46] <ggreer> it would be interesting if internet communities had a serendipity feature. eg: whenever you spend your time in that community reading comments or replying or whatever, there's a chance that you have a random encounter and suddenly you're prompted to chat with another active user

[21:19:08] <gwern> '"I mean, you know, otters may look sweet, but they don't do anything, they don't do anything positive. They just eat your fish and swim in the lake. And that's what they do. They might look nice to look at but they're not a little puppy that you can stroke, and if a kid tries to do it, they're going to bite them."' https://mothership.sg/2021/12/otters-bite-man-botanic-gardens/ man screw him,...
[21:19:10] <Robomot> Man bitten 26 times by otters at S'pore Botanic Gardens says no to culling - Mothership.SG - News from Singapore, Asia and around the world (He explained that he wishes to raise awareness of this incident so that the authorities can take greater action to prevent such incidents from happening again.)
[21:19:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... does anyone care about spoilers? Probably not, right?
[21:19:15] <gwern> ...swimming is awesome. I wake up every day grateful that otters exist and are swimming around eating fish and urchins and stuff
[21:19:16] <PapuaHardyNet> when a song's subject is described so clinically, it feels super awkward:
[21:19:19] <PapuaHardyNet> 'The song is about not caring about getting drunk, and always drinking to stop thinking about your ex.'
[21:19:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> If you do, stop reading. SPOILERS FOR DEVS INCOMING
[21:19:34] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: no. by the time anyone watches devs, they'll have forgotten anyway
[21:21:09] *** Joins: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage)
[21:22:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> So! In the first episode, bright young Bay Area startup coder Sergei shows his boss a demo: his team can take a simulated nematode (connectome plus activation weights, etc.) and use their fancy code that they wrote to precisely predict the behavior of an actual nematode, accurate to 30 seconds into the future
[21:22:07] *** Quits: voltage_ (voltage@user/voltage) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:23:25] <PapuaHardyNet> unrealistic, but sure, go on
[21:23:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Very cool! So his boss, the CEO (played by a long-haired Nick Offerman, here in a "Standard-issue Silicon Valley Brilliant And/Or Crazy Startup Founder" role), impressed by this feat, transfers Sergei to the DEVS department
[21:24:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... where, it turns out, they have a technology which can predict, not a nematode, but THE ENTIRE WORLD AND ALL THE PEOPLE AND THINGS IN IT, and not just 30 seconds into the future, but AN ARBITRARY DISTANCE INTO THE FUTURE AND ALSO THE PAST. This technology works by MAGIC.
[21:24:52] *** Joins: Fusxfaranto (~Fusxfaran@cpe-75-85-179-208.san.res.rr.com)
[21:25:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Or I can only assume it works by magic, because there's nothing even in the same ballpark as a reasonable explanation for how it can conceivably work)
[21:25:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> They use this technology to view fun and educational historical events, such as:
[21:25:57] <Obormot\Arcturus> 1. Jesus Christ being crucified.
[21:26:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> 2. Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe having sex.
[21:26:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> 3. ...
[21:28:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Now. The DEVS machine, or whatever, can predict the future, as I said. But this means the future is predetermined, right?? Right, so obviously Long-Haired Nick Offerman and his trusted lieutenant, Project Leader Alison Pill, have concluded that free will is an illusion and there is no such thing as choice
[21:29:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Several episodes in they have a conversation that goes like this:
[21:29:19] <Obormot\Arcturus> (paraphrasing from memory)
[21:30:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> "You know, we can predict the future, but what if, like, we set the machine to show us... us, two minutes from now, and it showed you like standing with your hands folded or something? But then you were like 'fuck fate lol, I'm gonna stick my hands in my pockets and not fold them at all', what would happen?? Wouldn't that prove that actually predestination is bullshit and our predictions are also bullshit"
[21:30:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> "The future is predetermined."
[21:31:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> *conversation ends*
[21:31:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> *they do not actually attempt this test*
[21:31:29] <bildramer> as we all know, scientists are fundamentally uncurious
[21:31:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> *they evidently have never attempted it previously either despite the fact that it would take two literal minutes and would bear directly on the central question not only of their work but also of ALL EXISTENCE*
[21:31:59] <gwern> it is the inevitable fate of time-travel stories to be watered down in popular media
[21:32:03] <gwern> eg _Arrival_
[21:32:04] <Khoth> it would cause a time paradox
[21:32:44] <bildramer> even fiction that "explores" these ideas doesn't, because, to be fair, you need to start postulating answers to currently unsolvable mathematical problems, do pspace calculations, find some mechanism for "which of the consistent time loop histories actually occur", etc. etc.
[21:32:52] <gwern> any answer would just cause problems for them when they commit to a model of time-travel - whether mutable futures or self-consistent histories or what
[21:33:09] <gwern> they have their story written and don't want to think too hard
[21:33:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> Then later there's some bullshit about people running around and punching and/or shooting each other for no real reason except to pad the serious out to eight episodes with some gratuitous drama (see my mini-review that I linked to saturn2 the other day for more on this)
[21:33:25] <bildramer> but authors trying (or even being able to grasp 10% of the issue) is praiseworthy
[21:33:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> At which point I stopped watching
[21:33:45] <gwern> (sad, but _back to the future_ or _bill and ted's incredible adventure_ is about as sophisticated as timetravel stories risk getting in movies/tv)
[21:33:58] <Obormot\Arcturus> BUT! I was curious (unlike the characters lol) so I went I looked up episode synopses of the rest of the series (eight episodes, as I said, in total)
[21:34:06] <Obormot\Arcturus> And do you know what?
[21:34:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> The climax of the fucking show involves the main protagonist watching a prediction of herself doing a thing, and then deciding to do a different thing.
[21:34:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> And that's the way the plot resolves.
[21:35:14] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean, just... are you fucking kidding me
[21:35:42] <gwern> yep. lazy writing. 'and then in the climax, she wills otherwise! the end.' 'wait, why is that a surprise? they never tried before?' 'no... I'll add a lampshading scene, let's just get this into prod'
[21:35:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And of course the CEO guy is shocked, absolutely shocked, by this completely unexpected and *totally unpredictable* development)
[21:35:58] <bildramer> in hollywood, "constraint" is another word for "setup", and the payoff is always breaking it, duh
[21:36:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern, bildramer: There are exceptions, of course, but they're _Primer_, lol
[21:36:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> And who wants that
[21:36:58] <gwern> and you'll note that he's washed out of hollywood
[21:37:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> mmhm
[21:37:06] <feep> haha, I had https://drumbit.app open in the back
[21:37:07] <Robomot> drumbit | Online drum machine (A very easy to use online drum machine. You can choose from various drum kits, create, save and edit your drum patterns and record it as audio files.)
[21:37:20] <feep> and I switched tabs and waterfox froze for ~1s, then caught up
[21:37:25] <Khoth> If it wasn't for that part, the original incuriousity reminds me of the greg egan story where they invent a device that can recieve messages from the future, and from then on there's no more science because the consistent timeline possibilities are "you have a brilliant idea and nobody ever tells the past about it", "you receive a brilliant idea from the future and later send it to the past" or "you never have a brilliant idea" and the first two options 
[21:37:25] <Khoth> require much more contrivance so they never happen
[21:37:27] <feep> and I was like "heh, I made a drop"
[21:37:56] <bildramer> wow that's the worst default kick sound I've experienced in my life
[21:38:09] <feep> bildramer: I have it set to house with swing 8
[21:38:23] <feep> honestly catchy
[21:38:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh and! AND!!
[21:39:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the end it turns out that the magic prediction machine is ALSO a magic universe simulator (wherein a couple of the characters end up in a continued existence after they die IRL), and it's revealed that actually "DEVS" means "Deus" and not "Devs" and *groooooaaaaaaaaan*
[21:40:00] <feep> auuugh
[21:40:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> Absolutely just the laziest shit possible
[21:40:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> Also most of the characters are boooooring
[21:41:52] <bildramer> "you receive a brilliant but disturbing set of ideas and also instructions on how to make amnesia drugs so you can live a normal life from the future, the people surrounding you are closer to obstacles than help, the events are never shown from your perspective so there are still mysteries for the audience"
[21:42:10] <bildramer> I'd read that
[21:42:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> The only two exceptions are a pair about whom I would honestly watch a whole show and who are genuinely fun to watch (and have excellent onscreen chemistry with each other) - two of the coders at DEVS: one of them is like an old-school hacker type (played by this dude https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_McKinley_Henderson ) and the other is a prodigy kid hacker (played by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cailee_Spaeny )
[21:42:37] <Robomot> Stephen McKinley Henderson - Wikipedia (Stephen McKinley Henderson (born August 31, 1949) is an American actor.[1] He is known primarily for his work onstage, notably in several of August Wilson's plays. He has made several appearances in film and television, including notable roles in biographical drama Lincoln (2012), coming-of-age film Lady Bird (2017), science fiction miniseries Devs (2020), and Mentat …)
[21:42:37] <Robomot> Cailee Spaeny - Wikipedia (Cailee Spaeny (/ˈkeɪli ˈspeɪni/;[2] born July 24, 1997) is an American actress.[3] Her first major role was in the science fiction action film Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018), which was followed by appearances in Bad Times at the El Royale, On the Basis of Sex, and Vice the same year. She also portrayed the lead of the supernatural horror film The Craft: Legacy (2020). On television, …)
[21:42:37] <feep> Khoth: also that is also what happens in arrows of time
[21:42:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> In the latter case it's actually a cool and unusual casting choice
[21:42:56] <feep> tho I guess that's egan too, so figures
[21:43:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Because the *character* is male
[21:43:05] <Khoth> feep: arrows of time is what I was referring to
[21:43:08] <feep> o
[21:43:12] <PapuaHardyNet> man, devs sounds rather painful to watch
[21:43:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Not "trans male" or "identifies as male" but just a regular guy)
[21:43:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> But the actor is female
[21:43:37] <PapuaHardyNet> what?
[21:43:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> She does an excellent job with the role!
[21:43:38] <feep> huh neat
[21:43:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> I was very impressed
[21:46:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> Anyway, those two do the whole "grumpy not-politically-correct old school hacker and young hacker prodigy whiz kid" dynamic very well and I wish we could get a whole show about them where they write web apps and solve crimes

[21:52:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> Isn't that just... a Chrome feature
[21:53:11] <adiabatic> Obormot\Arcturus: yes, it is a chrome feature
[21:53:24] <adiabatic> some people use better browsers though
[21:54:35] <gwern> it looks like it hashes in a pretty fragile way too
[21:55:42] <gwern> I could see something like that *possibly* being useful for gwern.net - maybe a JS snippet which sets the URL to the hash of the closest prior ID? but not this, not the way it's implemented. I change too many paragraphs for that to ever work
[21:56:03] <PapuaHardyNet> since we are talking about better browsers, I just searched waterfox since feep uses it
[21:56:22] <gwern> (because gwern.net pages are so sectionized and have lots of link IDs, I don't really need to select arbitrary text segments. that's just very fragile)
[21:56:23] <PapuaHardyNet> waterfox is interesting - it is based on firefox and uses firefox engine but is not firefox
[21:56:42] <PapuaHardyNet> basically the chromium equivalent for firefox
[21:57:15] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: do browsers let you update the URL bar's hash without actually jumping to it? I assume they have to or this extension wouldn't work, you'd select something and your screen would jump wildly
