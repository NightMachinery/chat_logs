[10:20:25] <icing> bagder: did not see you on the participant list in webex yesterday. was wondering: "why did he drag me here, if he planned to sleep already and have nice dreams?"
[10:20:46] <bagder> I popped in a little late but I was there
[10:21:28] <bagder> found most of the topics a little outside of my primary interest zone
[10:22:34] <bagder> although of course I bet the signed requests stuff etc will find itself into curl sooner or later
[10:23:22] <icing> Yeah, me too. About the signed requests: I need to read up really on the intended use. Or is it a generic framework for possibly everything?
[10:23:57] <bagder> I'm not sure either, but I'm leaning towards the latter after yday
[10:24:12] <icing> was afraid of that. hmm...

[11:38:53] <icing> if you are paid on bug report response time, however, always asking back to the reporter is the smart thing to do.
[11:39:11] <bagder> well true
[11:39:33] <bagder> its just that some of those questions seem like the dev doesn't really understand what's happening
[11:40:11] <icing> yes. asking what "properly quoting" means, tells something.
[11:41:31] <dege> a clear indication that promotions and bonuses are tied to delivering new things and not fixing existing ones..
