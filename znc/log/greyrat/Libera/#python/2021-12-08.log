[12:23:47] <boris[m]> Hello! Trying to create a GUI with pyqt , where I capture the video feed of my webcam I use this https://stackoverflow.com/a/43008266/3058542, where setPixmap() is called on that QLabel, for every new frame from the cam. Now I need a user to be able to draw a rectangle on that QLabel, to select an area to create a screenshot. I was thinking of a QPainter but this overrides the Pixmap of the QLabel. Do you have any other ideas?
[12:24:00] <jinsun> and you can just do attr.evolve(instance) without any changes
[12:24:09] <jinsun> to make a copy

[14:41:02] <netvor> hi, is there any general style recommendation with regards to use of "local functions" inside methods?    Eg. I'm implementing a method and rather than having 12 lines of code i prefer to break some parts to functions ..  what I usually do is  -- as long as the function would have no use outside the method -- is just go ahead and `def foo()` inside the method
[14:41:08] <pyzozord> so for list ['a', 'aa', 'bb'] it would result in {1: ['a'], 2: ['aa', 'bb']
[14:41:15] *** Joins: reset (~reset@user/reset)
[14:42:27] <netvor> other way --i suppose--- is to move it to separate (@static)methods but subjectively -- that seems like a pollution --- i find it much more readable when i do it that way
[14:42:56] <netvor> *"that" meaning the "local tiny function" way
[14:43:05] *** Joins: lethu (~lethu@user/lethu)
[14:43:28] <bjs> pyzozord: you probably want a default dict. `d = collections.defaultdict(list); for foo in bar: d[len(foo)].append(bar)`
[14:43:34] <pystardust> pyzozord:  but if too lists have same name they would have same key

[14:51:49] <bjs> pyzozord: it's a bit silly but yes

[14:52:47] <bjs> pyzozord: why are you so attached to it being one line?
[14:53:00] <pyzozord> I just feel like python should have some builtin for that
[14:53:03] <jinsun> yeah, the way to make one liners and expressions in python is to stuff it in a function, then when you call it, it will be a one liner
[14:53:06] <bjs> pyzozord: it does, it's called a "for loop"

[18:44:29] <Wooble> causasui: so it iterates the set you passed in, and adds each element to the new set.
[18:44:45] <Helion> You are converting a set of 1 element to a set of 1 element
[18:45:37] <Wooble> if it was *possible* to make a set of sets, you'd need set([{'00'}]) or some other iterable containing 1 set.
[18:45:45] <causasui> I think I'm getting it... so in a roundabout way it does "convert to string" but that's just because the members of the second set are all strings
[18:46:10] <Wooble> causasui: yeah, it's not really converting, though, just adding a reference to the original set items.
[18:46:12] <Helion> I thought you could make a set of frozensets (the idea of a frozenset being that it is specifically for that...)
[18:46:19] <Wooble> Helion: yes, that works fine.
[18:46:35] <causasui> Helion: you might have missed the original paste that got me confused https://bpa.st/PIBQ in this case the outer set is frozen, the inner set isn't

[19:36:19] <Wooble> pyzozord: if you have a shape with 6 segments, and it doesn't include both of the segments in "1", you know your shape has to be a "6" because the other 2 possibilities both are filled in on the right side.

[21:15:52] <InPhase> neverfindme: Python can be very enjoyable, as you can express many complicated operations very compactly and elegantly.  You can also get greatly increased Python performance by using appropriate libraries (e.g., numpy).  But it does not really have the same strengths as C++ for larger programs where stronger constraints are desired.

[23:23:41] <alchzh> aphysically if you're dealing with bits in pure python I'm not sure that reduce(or_ is actually any faster than sum(

[23:28:26] <aphysically> well, I was, but in the guise of Enum Flag which would have a type error
[23:28:33] <alchzh> it turns out I was not even close to being out of top 100 if I did the brute
[23:29:20] <nedbat> alchzh: i am glad that I am asleep when the problems come out, so i am not tempted to compete for the global leaderboard. I would stress out, and not make it anyway :)
[23:29:53] <alchzh> my best this year so far is 108
[23:29:58] <aphysically> nedbat: at least some parts do seem obviously intended to be brute forced so choosing between "brute force" or "think more" is probably a hard problem in general
