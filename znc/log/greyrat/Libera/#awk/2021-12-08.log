[02:20:46] <tag> Just so many encoding overloads
[02:21:01] <tag> 'cuz all that 8088 16 bit word crap is still in it
[02:21:08] <e36freak> i, for one, welcome our encoding overloads
[02:21:22] <tag> well, it's better than not having them
[02:21:29] <tag> because...you know, more instructions
[02:21:47] <tag> but I just disassembled some ARM code and my mind was blown â€” all the ops were exactly 32 bits!
[02:22:05] <e36freak> i see
[02:22:31] <e36freak> how do you determine an entry point when disassembling?
[02:22:55] <tag> Usually I'm looking at a specific function
[02:23:00] <tag> as is the case here
[02:23:24] <e36freak> i see
[02:23:50] <tag> And then I specify to the disassembler which symbol I want. It looks up that symbol in the symbol table for the binary (ELF, in this and most cases, because I'm on linux), takes the address and the size, jumps to that address, disassembles op per op until size, printing the results
[02:24:11] <tag> Right now I'm implementing JIT
[02:24:17] <e36freak> right, easy enough with like an elf, but what about just raw binary off of somethin
[02:24:19] <e36freak> g
[02:24:29] <e36freak> that you don't know what it is
[02:24:42] <tag> oh, why would I be looking at it if I don't know what it is?
[02:24:55] <e36freak> fair enough
[02:25:28] <e36freak> like, pulling something off a random arduino or other chip, ida asks for an entry point, have no idea where to start
[02:25:49] <e36freak> elfs are well defined
[02:25:50] <tag> Usually when I'm disassembling code it's because it's either software I run or software I'm working on and I'm either trying to figure out what the compiler is up to or like now I'm basically writing a compiler
[02:27:00] <tag> but I'm not writing the functions which are compiled, I'm actually extracting them from the program...so I am disassembling and reassembling the functions which are being composed so I can remove all the returns and replace them with near/short jumps
[02:27:22] <tag> or just removing them if they're the last op
[02:27:23] <e36freak> i see
[02:29:34] <tag> It's a little sketchy, but ... when you have a dynamically described operation which you execute like 80 million times a query, solutions like this make a difference.
