[00:15:45] <fizzie> As in, you can do `if err := foo(); err != nil { ... }` but you can't do `if var err = foo(); err != nil { ... }`. (You can, of course, do `var err = foo(); if err != nil { ... }` but then the variable will have a different scope.)

[01:03:05] <acagastya> Hi, I have created a TCP connection to net.Dial (actually to irc.libera.chat) and I am trying to read the messages sent by the server using `bufio.NewReader(conn).ReadString('\n')`.  I am then printing those messages to stdout, but the number of messages I see printed by this are less than when I use netcat.  I am suspecting the MOTD message sent by the server contains more than one occurance of \n.  So how do I read incoming message from the serv

[01:34:39] <ikke> tcp is a streaming protocol
[01:34:57] <ikke> so the idea is that you just keep reading data and process what's comming in

[01:36:29] <ikke> that's what bufio does for you

[02:09:09] <pjs> I know what a x.(X) type assertion is, but what is something like (*x.X).Method() do? In this case, "x" is already a pointer of it's object.
[02:09:56] <b0nn> X is a pointer too
[02:10:24] <b0nn> when you prepend with a * you're saying that the last thing in the.. statement.. is a pointer being dereferenced
[02:10:43] <b0nn> so you put brackets around to show the compiler where you are dereferencing
[02:11:44] <b0nn> *x.X.Method() would be dereferencing the output from that method (not possible because it's not addressable)
[02:12:07] <b0nn> (*x).X.Method() is dereferencing the first x

[02:36:31] <fizzie> It's a little subtle. A method declared on a non-pointer receiver, `func (x) foo()`, is in the method sets of both `x` and `*x`. On the other hand, `func (*x) foo()` is *only* in the method set of `*x`, but there's a rule that allows a call like `x.foo()` still if x is addressable, in which case it's as if you had written `(&x).foo()`.

[02:57:48] <pjs> so you can see, (*c.conn) where conn is a *net.Conn

[02:58:33] <pjs> Interesting.
[02:58:40] <fizzie> (`net.Conn` is an interface type, so `*net.Conn` is a pointer to an interface, and therefore has no methods of its own.)

[03:01:36] <b0nn> I don't know if there *is* a legitimate reason to create a pointer to an interface, but the compiler is happy with it, so there must be a reason forthe concept to exist
[03:02:26] <b0nn> I mean, an interface is really an abstract, and the type that satisfies the interface is what people are probably trying to point to, but, that's not really done by creating a pointer to the interface
[03:05:46] *** Joins: christophergray (~christoph@186.151.84.243)
[03:06:24] <fizzie> I could vaguely imagine a situation where you have an interface-typed value somewhere (let's say an `io.Reader` field in a struct), and you'd want to find a way for some code to be able to change that specific field, without giving it access to the whole struct, so you might give it an `*io.Reader` it can write through. But it's not exactly convincing.

[03:12:04] <fizzie> FWIW, there's no instances of `*io.Reader` in the Go distribution itself, and exactly one `*io.Writer`, and that one's just an example of using reflect.TypeOf, where there's a call to `reflect.TypeOf((*io.Writer)(nil)).Elem()`, because `reflect.TypeOf(io.Writer(nil))` wouldn't work.

[12:29:00] <rendar> my book writes it as `var x = ...`
[12:29:13] <ikke> yes, that means the type is inferred
[12:29:35] <rendar> i see now
[12:29:57] <rendar> so, {1,2,3..} without [9]int is nothing

[13:52:21] <fizzie> StyXman: What did you mean by "final" type there? Per the documentation, you can type-assert a `crypto.PublicKey` to `interface { Equal(crypto.PublicKey) bool }` (or give that interface a name, and then type-assert it to that) if you want to call the method.

[19:02:23] *** Quits: resamvi (~resamvi@user/resamvi) (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[19:04:10] <emg> I can do strings.NewReader("") but that feels like it's extra complicated and I should be able to create something like io.Discard but for reading
[19:04:10] <siXy> Something like bytes.NewBuffer([]byte{}) might work for you.
[19:10:04] <MD87> or io.MultiReader()

[19:47:45] <fizzie> `bytes.NewReader(nil)` as well, I would think. Although you could almost certainly write an always-at-EOF "stateless" io.Reader implementation if you liked. Not that I imagine it would normally be an efficiency concern.
