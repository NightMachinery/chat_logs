[05:05:25] <twomoon> is anathema a noun or an adj?
[05:05:44] <twomoon> it's listed as a noun in the dictionary but it seems to be used like an adjective
[05:08:33] <bin> twomoon: i've only seen it as a noun
[05:08:41] <MetaNova> I've only seen it used as a noun
[05:08:41] <bin> can you give an example where you've seen it as an adjective?
[05:09:27] <twomoon> the way it's used is not noun-like
[05:09:34] <bin> do you have an example?
[05:09:51] <twomoon> racial hatred was anathema to her
[05:10:04] <twomoon> here it seems to behave like an adjective, doesn't it?
[05:10:18] <twomoon> anathema doesn't behave like a countable or uncountable noun
[05:10:30] <twomoon> so therefore we must conclude that it is actually something else
[05:10:59] <bin> well think about the word means
[05:11:19] <MetaNova> if the term as it is used can be replaced by "repugnant" or "abhorrent" then it seems to be used correctly
[05:11:25] <MetaNova> "racial hatred was abhorrent to her"
[05:11:47] <bin> those are adjecties though
[05:11:57] <bin> so I can kind of see what he means
[05:12:12] <twomoon> i'm trying to think of another noun that behaves like this
[05:12:28] <MetaNova> crud, that is an adjective
[05:12:39] <bin> I guess because it has "to her" at the end it does seem like an adjective
[05:12:52] <bin> and it doesn't have an article
[05:13:15] <twomoon> anathema is like a persona non-grata
[05:13:30] <twomoon> however, we may not put 'a/an' in front of it like with 'persona non-grata'
[05:13:43] <bin> yeah
[05:15:08] <twomoon> are there any uncountable nouns that don't work with the modifier 'some'?
[05:15:46] <twomoon> anathema may be part of a class of uncountable nouns that don't behave well
[05:20:29] <twomoon> He had a notoriously high failure rate, which of course made him the anathema of Carter High School.

[06:21:38] <LjL> "Under high densities matter becomes a degenerate gas when all electrons are stripped from their parent atoms.

[06:22:11] <LjL> which is one way to interpret "degenerate"
[06:23:25] <sem> "degenerate gas" like who decided to call it that? and why? Does it just mean "the thing that happens later"?
[06:24:07] <sem> because "degenerate" when applied to a person certainly still does mean "worse than your ancestors" though as more of a shorthand
[06:24:37] <LjL> Having deteriorated, degraded or fallen from normal, coherent, balanced and desirable to undesirable and typically abnormal; an immoral or corrupt person.
[06:24:59] <LjL> "degraded from normal, coherent, balanced and desirable" seems to apply, although it is of course very earth-centric
[06:25:03] <LjL> it's "not a gas as we usually have them here"

[12:16:36] <LRN> For example, let's say you're telling someone about your trip. You start by narrating how you packed your suitcase, and listing the things that you packed in there. <point X>. Then you describe the trip in its entirety (using as much time/space as it takes).
[12:17:22] <Me-me> If there's a word for that, I don't know it.
[12:17:26] <LRN> THEN you come to a point at the end of the trip, where you discovered that one item that you had packed turned out to be useless and that you never took it out of your suitcase.

[12:19:20] <LRN> I know the idiom that is used when you unintentionally break the chronological order and you have to come back to. In such cases you say "but i'm getting ahead of myself" or "but let's not get ahead of ourselves".
[12:20:20] <LRN> What i need is the idiom that is used to /preface/ such sentences. I.e. "The rest of this sentence is related to things that i didn't know at the time but know now".
[12:23:33] <LRN> Something like "spoiler alert:", but milder, since this isn't really much of a spoiler.
[12:23:38] <Me-me> Storytellers I know would just say things like, "That will be important later," "Remember that for later," or, "And I didn't notice at the time, but:" And so on.

[12:46:36] <LRN> That is, you don't narrate and then "Flashback:". You just describe an earlier episode, putting in some words to indicate that it happened earlier, and the audience will understand that you're using a literary trope called "flashback". But you don't say "flashback" to the audience.

[15:46:08] <Maxdamantus> No.
[15:46:30] <Maxdamantus> Because Mg is megagram, which is a billion times more massive.
[15:47:01] <darsie> Or magnesium.
[15:47:05] <twb> darsie: you mean at the start of a sentence?
[15:47:08] <darsie> yes
[15:47:23] <twb> I don't like either answer, so my suggestion is: rewrite the sentence to avoid it
[15:47:32] <darsie> mhm
[15:47:45] <twb> e.g. in your example, "The abbreviation for milligram is 'mg'."
[15:47:57] <twb> "Milligrams are abbreviated to 'mg'."
