[16:49:37] <BinarySavior> hi, i'm having trouble with name resolution over Openvpn
[16:50:28] <BinarySavior> on my LAN, i have reserved ip address on DHCP for raspberrypi at 10.12.21.140.  Once connected to openvpn I can ping the ip-addr but I can't ping the hostname
[16:53:11] <rob0> use dig(1) to test DNS, not ping
[16:53:46] <rob0> you'd also have to describe how openvpn is involved in your question
[16:54:24] <BinarySavior> this issue only occurs when client is connected to openvpn server
[17:03:08] <BtbN> If OpenVPN overrides your LANs DNS server, you naturally can't resolve local hostnames anymore
[17:03:16] <f8e4> me stuck at https://openvpn.net/community-resources/how-to/#routing-all-client-traffic-including-web-traffic-through-the-vpn ;  how to use a local DNS (phihole) on a fixed ip on my LAN, while everything else should pass through vpn
[17:03:21] <BtbN> that's usually intended and enforced quite strongly, to prevent DNS leaks
[17:05:12] <BinarySavior> well this vpn is for me to connect to home when I am in public, I am not concerned about DNS leaks
[17:05:32] <BinarySavior> primary uses are home automation and file server
[17:05:35] <rob0> there are other people here with other qustionss
[17:06:30] <f8e4> BtbN why though, the DNS is a network of servers and the calleee does not know it is the guy previously resolving TLDs
[17:06:55] <f8e4> local dns gets the ip, then use the ip through vpn
[17:07:12] <rob0> f8e4, I guess you did something to override DNS for clients?  Where is the server?  Where are clients?
[17:07:19] <BtbN> What do you mean, why?
[17:07:40] <BtbN> If you use a VPN to tunnel all your traffic, you absolutely need to ensure that includes DNS, so you don't leak out of the tunnel.
[17:08:01] <rob0> (depending on your goal)
[17:08:25] <BtbN> If you don't want the VPN to override your DNS servers, don't configure it to do so.
[17:08:44] <BtbN> But be aware that your local network and ISP will still see all names you resolve then
[17:10:15] <f8e4> rob0 push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp" on vps server
[17:10:43] <f8e4> BtbN it does not, i use local pi-hole + cloudflare resolver, which if see is ok
[17:11:03] <BtbN> So, DNS still goes via your ISP and it sees all names
[17:13:58] <f8e4> are the dns queries not encrypted?
[17:14:05] <BtbN> DNS is plain text
[17:14:44] <f8e4> is ok; how to run dns to local static ip resolver in lan?
[17:14:54] <BtbN> What do you mean?
[17:14:56] <f8e4> flag: bypass-dns -- Add a direct route to the DNS server(s) (if they are non-local) which bypasses the tunnel
[17:15:37] <f8e4> how to push from server.conf a bypass to use local client lans custom dns
[17:16:38] <BtbN> Unless that's your only client ever, I wouldn't write that into the servers config, but in your specific insecure client ones.
[17:17:05] <f8e4> cool, tell me more
[17:18:07] <BtbN> Not much more to tell there
[17:19:08] <rob0> It's trivial to run a local DNS resolver which does not depend on ISP DNS nor any other resolver.  For example, named(8) with an empty named.conf(5) file will do recursion for locally-attached networks.  (It would see a VPN as "attached" if named runs on the openvpn server.)
[17:20:05] <BtbN> It will still do that in plain text though
[17:22:31] <rob0> ISPs are not smart enough to sniff that traffic.

[18:34:17] <Swahili> Q: Setup OpenVPN by following the basic setup. Works fine. Although notice that whoever connects to it, can't ping each other. As I'm not aware of how long that'd take to setup, does anyone have any idea how long that'd take?
[18:35:05] <Swahili> * my use-case is a windows remote desktop machine (host), that should be accessible in the vpn (found by name in the network) by the client-app (windows remote desktop).
[18:35:44] <Swahili> * at the moment, my ip-address on mac looks like 192.* while someone else is 172.* and also confirmed can't connect to the remote desktop
[18:36:05] <Swahili> Any hints or suggestions are appreciated. I'll do check the doc and see if takes to long to setup.
[18:42:11] <BtbN> Doesn't Windows just not respond to pings?
[18:53:27] <rob0> windows firewall, see /topic
[19:00:20] <Swahili> BtbN: rob0 oh I'll check that shortly
[19:00:23] <Swahili> thanks for helping me
[19:00:27] <Swahili> I'll brb, have to reboot

[19:43:29] <rob0> ah, you are using Access Server.
[19:44:00] <rob0> This channel is for the GPL community version openvpn(8).
[19:44:44] <rob0> For AS, seek support at openvpn.net/support and/or post in the forums.
[19:45:36] <rob0> AS does not work with "the basic setup", you must have followed AS directions.
[20:13:43] <swahili> rob0 I'd rather use the GPL community version, I wasn't aware, picked a digital ocean image
