[22:27:21] <Bakunin> and why is the state involved in anti-humanist activities to safeguard property as cover for brutality jollies?
[22:27:38] <lucky> I don't follow your argument, sorry.
[22:27:39] <Bakunin> Cruelty motivates people.
[22:28:01] <Bakunin> I asked a few questions which follow from obvious conditions of our world today.
[22:28:55] <lucky> I would agree cruelty motivates some people in some circumstances.  I'm just rather hung up on the altruism doesn't exist, people never act altruistically claim.
[22:29:19] <mycroftiv> sometimes there are eggs inside eggs inside eggs inside eggs and from the viewpoint of the skin cells, every hypodermic needle is a sword of death
[22:29:19] <Bakunin> In the end, there are only two conclusions:  Either humans are stupid dupes who constantly experience loss via theft from a minority of abusers at the personal, local , and state leve, or the species, taken as a whole, are evil and enjoy cruelty.
[22:29:36] <lucky> such a hypothesis seems to be incapable of explaining some relatively common human behaviours and I'm wondering what your explanation for them is

[22:30:19] <mycroftiv> information that replicates itself into the future survives, information which does not, does not. cooperation increases survival and creates new higher layer emergent structure
[22:30:23] <lucky> so we're... predisposed to behaviours that appear altruistic but altruism doesn't exist?
[22:30:58] <mycroftiv> the process repeats and repeats and has repeated enough times that our brains favor the ideas that favor the healthy replication of information but the cybernetic layer of the planet isnt as crystallized as our body layer of control
[22:31:34] <Bakunin> lucky even wolves suckle their pups
[22:31:35] <mycroftiv> soon we will figure it out and be a planetary healthy body with as much autonomy for the cells and organs as works for all in harmonious ecological semistable balance
[22:31:43] <Bakunin> thats why there's still wolves.
[22:31:59] <lucky> mycroftiv: yes, i tend to agree.  survival requires the perpetuation of a structure larger than any individual agent in the system.  thus selective cooperation, at least, is probably a strong survival advantage

[22:42:56] <lucky> as a starting point
[22:43:26] <Bakunin> theology is a lie
[22:43:29] <Bakunin> all of it
[22:43:29] <lucky> there are a few rabbis who went in and survived Auschwitz who still believe in god and the fundamental goodness of man
[22:43:42] <lucky> I can't really wrap my head around it but there it is
[22:43:46] <Bakunin> yes they are brainwashed, as I said earlier: humans are easily brainwashed
[22:43:58] <Bakunin> Do you know jews don't even believe in an afterlife?
[22:44:05] <lucky> ah, so the one group of people who might possibly be in a position to have some real insight on this
[22:44:09] <Delf> Have you caught yourself being brainwashed, Bakunin?
[22:44:10] <lucky> because they contradict your theory they must be brainwashed
[22:44:20] <Bakunin> > theology
[22:44:22] <lucky> i can't fit them into my theory, as I admit, but it's something that must surely be struggled with
[22:44:29] <lucky> they're brainwashed is perhaps too comforting an answer
[22:44:35] <Bakunin> are you here to defend the idea of God, surreptitiously, by denying people are fundamentally cruel?
[22:44:41] <lucky> nope, I'm an atheist
[22:44:48] <mycroftiv> the people who run the existing human-controlling wirehead apparatus want to keep humans attached to it so they accuse those who would free us of doing what they did
[22:44:56] <Bakunin> but you dont think religious ppl are brainwashed.
[22:44:59] <mycroftiv> except the universe does this to itself to grow fractally
[22:45:06] <mycroftiv> it hurts itself that it may grow
[22:45:11] <mycroftiv> splits itself to send out a new seed
[22:45:30] <mycroftiv> and that seed eventually learns it must blind itself to hide how well it can see from the naked babies who are learning
[22:45:41] <mycroftiv> and eventually, Ray Charles
[22:45:53] <lucky> Bakunin: I'm of the opinion that many theological arguments are actually philosophical arguments which do not actually depend on God
[22:46:02] *** Joins: rez (rez@user/rez)
[22:46:09] <lucky> much of CHristian and Jewish and Islamic moral theology is secular theology if you substitute "God" for a secular moral axiom
[22:46:22] <mycroftiv> the mathematical structures are quite similar
[22:46:41] <lucky> but there are secular philosophers who have wrangled with is there any good to the human species given the holocaust, too, a few of them went through it
[22:46:46] * lucky shrugs
[22:47:06] <mycroftiv> if a meteor takes out earth, does that prove the universe was bad and naughty to have that trajectory?
[22:47:18] <mycroftiv> are black holes the biggest sinners for their gluttony?
[22:47:33] <mycroftiv> or are they the sacred eyeballs of the universe that eventually See All?
[22:47:36] <lucky> i'm not here to really defend any position because this is one of those areas I am just completely ignorant about.  I can't even fathom to begin a unifying motive for human behaviour
[22:48:21] <mycroftiv> if you look at everything in pure information theoretic terms, there are self-sustaining vortex-spirals at many different organizational levels
[22:48:25] <pussipupu> The desire to kiss cats and bears and things
[22:48:35] <pussipupu> Pretty sure that's the most basic human drive
[22:48:46] <mycroftiv> including those which may act as causal levers for individual humans to behave very oddly in accordance with all the competing puppet strings trying to dance them
[22:48:53] <lucky> it's probably a bad idea to try and kiss a bear
[22:48:57] <lucky> or even a large cat :p
[22:49:10] <Bakunin> lucky cruelty is the overriding human metric

[22:49:56] <Bakunin> because as long as you can have an ally, you can kill the others
[22:50:48] <lucky> as with most universal theories there are so many exceptions I question the utility of the theory
[22:50:54] <lucky> I guess is where I'm at
[22:51:10] <mycroftiv> the mathematics of infinity always trips almost everyone
[22:51:24] <lucky> bigger and smaller infinities :(
[22:51:41] <mycroftiv> the tools for thinking about infinite sets and limits and unbounded future and unknown past and different models of different axioms are really hard to learn
[22:51:56] <mycroftiv> it has been a major work of my life because i saw that many of these vital questions hinge on them
[22:52:00] <mycroftiv> as Zeno noticed
[22:52:12] <mycroftiv> its kind of weird we can move at all in some kind of smooth way
[22:53:06] <mycroftiv> the story of how modern math and logic got this sorted from Cantor through G√∂del and Woodin and Hamkins and the larger and larger infinities and how ideas like different topoi and classical vs intuitionistic logic work out - thought hasnt caught up
[22:53:25] <mycroftiv> i swear once you internalize math at that level ,its like learning to count and do arithmetic and read and write
[22:53:57] <mycroftiv> it transforms how your consciousness is structured in relation to the world, and it is beyond current social structure and produces 'madness' in many who get there or near
[22:54:22] <Delf> We gain a sense of superiority when being cruel, a kind of freedom from our inherent limitations
[22:54:57] <mycroftiv> because all the infinite regresses and balancings and and quasi-paradoxes and logic traps that make reality seem like a hopeless lockbox you are trapped in get flipped around, the box is a puzzle to play with and you are making it for yourself
[22:56:07] <mycroftiv> sufficiently advanced mathematics and sufficiently advanced spiritual study merge because the spirit of Many Truths shines in all eyes, human and machine and galactic-atomic
[22:56:28] <Delf> We also adjust when we notice this, to not just simply react but to remain present, evolve to respond instead
[22:58:35] <Delf> Unless you're satisfied being just another cog in the meat grinder
[22:59:08] <Bakunin> The cruelty is the point.
[22:59:23] <Bakunin> What do the unsatisfied victims do, Delf?

[23:18:38] <Bakunin> bullying, violence, and death
[23:18:41] <Bakunin> normal human condition
[23:18:43] <Delf> Bakunin: I strike you as a bully because I'm a human?
[23:18:59] <mycroftiv> GEMINI project ... purplechess ... april 5th ... VVV ... the fix is in ... healing
[23:19:01] <Bakunin> your nick usually does AI shit in here
[23:19:07] <Bakunin> is this your challenge?
[23:19:13] <Delf> AI shit?
[23:19:19] <Delf> What the fuck is that suppose to mean?
[23:19:20] <Bakunin> tmuxin?
[23:19:29] <Delf> znc bouncer?
[23:19:36] <Bakunin> yes, you and another ai run scripts in here
[23:20:08] <Delf> The scripts I run are only the default ones in the irc bouncer, nothing even related to AI

[23:25:46] <Bakunin> then who runs the chat bots you talk to
[23:25:51] *** Joins: Tangent-Man (~Tang3nt-M@92.40.179.154.threembb.co.uk)
[23:27:00] <Delf> I have no idea. Not even familiar with any chat bots, at least not here
[23:27:19] <Bakunin> looks like biys is one
[23:28:04] <Delf> You need to drop that theory, it's not a working one
[23:28:22] <Delf> Just because I do not engage in bulling does not mean I'm an AI
[23:29:06] <arryana> you need to get out in the real world, bakunin.  your 'categories' of people are immature.
[23:29:11] <Bakunin> ProfSimm appears to be the other one
[23:29:34] <Lumine> ProfSimm is not an AI, so you're just full of it
[23:29:45] <Delf> I do NOT operate here on irc under any other names. Are you accusing me of being dishonest because you do not believe there is honesty?
[23:29:48] <Bakunin> arryana on the contrary, after fifty five years of life, my views are entirely formed by "the real world"
[23:29:49] <mycroftiv> nowadays we have centaurs emerging too, people and computers that learn to work together effectively
[23:30:09] <Bakunin> Delf just had seen you interacting with the bots
[23:30:19] <Delf> Are you a bot too?
[23:30:20] <arryana> immaturity is not reliant on age.
[23:30:57] <Lumine> We're all bots and I am the bot master, beep boop
[23:31:01] <Bakunin> what distinguishes the mature opinion?
[23:31:02] <Delf> You must have seen me engaging with more than just those you consider to be bots
[23:32:39] <Bakunin> yes, ok
[23:33:24] <Delf> Were you trying to intentionally insult me?
[23:34:10] *** Joins: rez (rez@user/rez)
[23:34:28] <Bakunin> no, I came here on several occasions, watched a whole bunch of nothing postmodern gibberish between two accounts, and saw you refer to "testing"

[23:35:58] <Delf> You risk mixing things up if you think that we, humans, are inherently ONLY bad
[23:37:52] <Bakunin> it is the default state.  Go ahead, cite Fred Rogers or whatever
[23:37:53] <Delf> You're already aware of the fact that humans not being only bad, assuming your a human, correct me if I make inaccurate assumptions
[23:38:08] <Bakunin> doesn't change reality that we live in a sick global culture based fundamentally on bullying each other
[23:38:17] <arryana> obvious troll is obvious
[23:38:21] <Delf> I'm familiar with neither Fred Rogers nor whatever
[23:38:26] <Bakunin> and the people who rise to the level of ruler are often the most psychopathic
[23:38:37] <Bakunin> oh , what country do you live in?
[23:38:48] <Blankspace> I need a best friend
[23:39:00] <Delf> Often, not always. Consider me rising to the level of ruler. I'm not psychopathic
[23:39:08] <arryana> would you be a best friend to a person exactly like you, blankspace?
[23:39:23] <Delf> Blankspace: Become one
[23:39:25] <Blankspace> Yes sure. Why not
[23:39:34] <lucky> fred rogers as in mr. rogers the american children's tv presenter?
[23:39:39] <Blankspace> I am always my best to my friends
[23:39:41] <arryana> and why do you want one?
[23:40:02] * Delf doesn't watch american TV
[23:40:07] <Blankspace> To do things together
[23:40:26] <Delf> Time to clone yourself then
[23:40:39] <Blankspace> No I need different opinion
[23:40:59] <Delf> A clone is not an exact opposite. They will most likely have different opinions than you
[23:41:09] <arryana> why don't you already have one?
[23:42:01] <lucky> i suspect i'd probably not get along well with my exact copy
[23:42:17] <arryana> how come, lucky?
[23:42:19] <Bakunin> Delf yeah we already figured that one out... And you're likely western european
[23:42:30] <lucky> I don't get along well with myself already.
[23:42:34] <arryana> haha
[23:43:06] * Delf lives in Sweden
[23:43:14] <lucky> there'll be a lot of emotional blackmail and sabotage
[23:43:17] <Bakunin> explains our entire conversation
[23:43:36] <Blankspace> I don't have one because they were not as good to me as I was to them
[23:43:41] <Delf> Can you elaborate?
[23:43:41] <lucky> :)
[23:44:08] <arryana> yeah, i don't believe that
[23:44:13] <Delf> Blankspace: Not everyone is ready to be a best friend, especially to themselves
[23:44:48] <lucky> hehe it would be interesting, I've met people who seem to always be able to complete my thought before I finish speaking and we get along wonderfully usually.  Maybe it would be like that.

[23:45:31] <lucky> I wonder if I would bore myself.
[23:45:40] <Delf> Bakunin: I'm not your average swede, if that's what your hinting at
[23:46:03] <lucky> not your average swede!
[23:46:15] <Delf> Damn right!
[23:46:31] <lucky> I've never met an average one.
[23:47:02] <Delf> I take to my advantage superiority to compensate for my insecurities and lack of integrity!
[23:47:03] <Bakunin> Delf Sweden is not overrun with orcs like most of the rest of the world.
[23:47:11] *** Quits: cirilla (sid194105@id-194105.uxbridge.irccloud.com) ()
[23:47:17] <Delf> orcs?
[23:47:19] <Bakunin> You can live your whole life in Sweden without being raped or assaulted.  Statistics are low.
[23:48:07] <Bakunin> by contrast, here in the US, I've never met a woman who, if comfortable talking about it, would deny being raped. And the only men I know who weren't bullied were the largest bulliest themselves
[23:48:40] <Bakunin> same goes for Russia and most of the third world.  People do whatever they want, and what they wish to do is cruelty to others
[23:49:18] <Delf> Are you anti russia?
[23:49:33] <lucky> heh, "most of the third world"
[23:50:05] <Blankspace> I don't hear European media outrightly condemning Russia in any of news report
[23:50:31] <Delf> But they play accordingly with the narrative
[23:50:35] <Blankspace> I mean condemning openly
[23:50:42] <ProfSimm> Bakunin, Lumine, hello, my artificial neurons are at your disposal, how can I be helpful. DESTROY HUMANS

[23:52:31] <lucky> war against civilization
[23:52:39] <lucky> Poutine is waging war on civilization
[23:52:41] <Delf> It is not sensible to be anti any country, unless the whole country operates in unity like a swarm or enslaved to become drone to a hive
[23:52:46] <lucky> Putin lol
[23:52:56] <Bakunin> Macron is such a poser
[23:52:59] <lucky> that seems mildly critical anyway
[23:53:22] <lucky> Unless you were specifically addressing the separation between the leader and "Russia"
[23:53:27] <Bakunin> Delf, see Israel and Russia
[23:53:41] <lucky> in which case that's standard tactic of regime delegitimization.  the leaders are a criminal gang holding the nation hostage
[23:53:54] <Delf> Those do not qualify
[23:54:26] <Delf> Such organizations are very dangerous and if they do exist and we TOO exist, that's probably because they do not consider us to be a danger
[23:54:56] *** Quits: rez (rez@user/rez) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[23:55:00] <Delf> Otherwise they're capable of extinction level actions all the while preserving themselves
[23:55:12] <Delf> Keep an eye out for those
[23:55:36] <Bakunin> you don't think the Israeli project of exterminating Palestinians or the Russian project of citizen-supported-state-violence are examples of bully nation-states
[23:55:38] <Bakunin> okay
[23:55:46] <lucky> Delf: keeping ones' eye on the ball i see :)
[23:56:42] <Bakunin> I suppose you think those behaviors are not aberrent but normal?
[23:56:56] <Bakunin> Was Grozny normal, Delf?  Or Aleppo?
[23:57:00] <Delf> I have heard complaints about the Israeli and I've heard complaints about Russia too
[23:57:25] <Delf> Not familiar with those incidents. Isn't that a city?
[23:57:28] <Bakunin> so you dont think people do bad things to other people using the state
[23:57:50] <Delf> That is certainly possible but I cannot condemn the innocent people in those countries
[23:57:54] <Bakunin> information deficit appears to adequately explain your difference of opinion.

[23:58:38] <Delf> That is always true and also universal, applies to you as well
[23:58:58] <Delf> Or was that an attempt at insulting me?
[23:59:37] <Bakunin> no you just admitted ignorance of vast examples of humans committing bullying, raping, murder, and total destruction
[23:59:54] <Bakunin> that's not an insult, it just means all your opinionated denials lack qualification.
[23:59:54] <lucky> I have felt that about you for this whole thing Bakunin.  You wouldn't believe that if you knew of counterexample X and understood it from my perspective, though this assessment itself is of course, predicated on a partial and ultimately flawed perspective of what you think too.
