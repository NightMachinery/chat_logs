[03:31:34] <gtlsgamr> Good morning folks! How are you fucked by log4j today?
[06:29:36] <gtlsgamr> New vulnerability came on a saturday. Right after we patched 13 servers and third party vendor applications
[06:29:44] <gtlsgamr> They released new patches
[06:29:51] <gtlsgamr> have to install all... again.
[06:29:53] <gtlsgamr> fuck.

[06:40:45] <Hello[m]> Hey just wanted to ask why website is redirecting means there came a message from Flipkart regarding offer on whtsp which gave this(http://) link and then it redirects to (https://) link then wth they can't give https website link first is there any possibility that it collect any data. As we should'nt enter any data on http website so.
[06:45:05] <gtlsgamr> What is the link
[06:45:06] <gtlsgamr> pls send
[06:46:14] <Hello[m]> gtlsgamr: http://fkrt.it/6l4tkYNN
[06:46:42] <gtlsgamr> Hahaa!
[06:47:19] <gtlsgamr> Very simple explanation. Whoever gave you the link is an affiliate guy, so they must have copied the link without https.. and when you open it, flipkart DNS automatically redirs to https
[06:47:23] <gtlsgamr> nothing to worry
[06:47:37] <gtlsgamr> That is an affiliate link
[06:47:49] <gtlsgamr> so if you buy something from there, the person who gave that link will earn commission
[06:48:04] <Hello[m]> gtlsgamr: Ok
[06:48:27] <Hello[m]> gtlsgamr: Ohh that's how it works

[13:18:48] <M-------[m]> I clean installed windows and zorin over kalilinux yesterday and I can boot into both by selecting boot options but when I don't select anyting it boots and shows grub rescue which was of Kali installation I think. Zorin installation gave grub installation error so I booted into live USB and ran bootrepair which gave vram locked error but rebooting and selecting Ubuntu as boot option worked. How can I boot into zorin grub directly
[13:18:49] <M-------[m]> or any other way to do this?
[13:19:20] <gtlsgamr> Your grub is unconfigured
[13:19:41] <M-------[m]> How can I fix that?
[13:20:06] <M-------[m]> I think that was kali's grub
[13:20:10] <gtlsgamr> rtm. read the manual. or just google it, 'how to fix grub resuce'
[13:21:03] <M-------[m]> But on pressing F12 I can boot into windows by selecting windows boot manager and into sorin by selecting ubuntu
[13:21:08] <M-------[m]> s/sorin/zorin/
[13:21:13] <gtlsgamr> Yes you mentioned that already. 
[13:21:26] <gtlsgamr> That means your grub isn't properly configured.
[13:21:33] <gtlsgamr> You will have to boot into zorin and fix it
[13:21:58] <M-------[m]> Ok
[14:09:03] <Akshay[m]1> <M-------[m]> "I think that was kali's grub" <- You can fix that on grub customizer. It has gui

[17:41:48] <Akshay[m]1> Hemish[m]: I feel happy now
[17:42:15] <Hemish[m]> That indian linux user group is also a bridged telegram group
[17:42:26] <Hemish[m]> And one person uses irc and one uses matrix there
[17:42:39] <Hemish[m]> All other use telegram
[17:44:32] <Akshay[m]1> Everyone just need a ton of features
[17:45:16] <Govindas[m]> <NeoVoid[m]> "does anyone knows any good..." <- freetube
[17:45:48] <Hemish[m]> I think matrix has all what telegram has
[17:46:00] <Govindas[m]> no, not all
[17:46:02] <Hemish[m]> And it's good that you can use whatever client you think is good
[17:46:04] <Govindas[m]> it misses disappearing messages
[17:46:34] <Hemish[m]> Use irc for disppearing messages
[17:46:35] <Govindas[m]> it also doesn't have socks5 proxy support on android, unlike telegram
[17:47:01] <Govindas[m]> is irc e2e encrypted?
[17:47:08] <Hemish[m]> No
[17:47:20] <Hemish[m]> But messages so disappear as they are not saved 😃
[17:47:23] <Govindas[m]> then that doesn't fit, my messages need to be disappearing after 1 week and end-to-end encrypted
[17:49:08] <Hemish[m]> Matrix has encrypted chats
[17:49:29] <gtlsgamr> IRC is NOT SECURE
[17:49:33] <gtlsgamr> just so you know
[17:49:36] <gtlsgamr> it is not meant to be secure

[18:46:12] <Hemish[m]> Though I know think of removing them from Google servers as remeber all my passwords (all are different but follow a common scheme so I can remeber each passed)

[18:46:44] <Arya[m]> everyone ik has like a master password they use for everything
[18:47:02] <Hemish[m]> I remeber all my passwords but i am very reluctant to type them again and again. Browser does a good job
[18:47:22] <Arya[m]> use bitwarden
[18:47:27] <Hemish[m]> Maybe I will make some dmenu thing to get my passwords
[18:47:30] <Arya[m]> or pass if you are more paranoid

[18:50:43] <Arya[m]> sed
[18:51:33] <Hemish[m]> No, non gnome applications also require keyring sometimes
[18:52:25] <gtlsgamr> minecraft launcher needs gnome keyring
[18:52:30] <gtlsgamr> and I don't know how to ignore it
[18:52:38] <Hemish[m]> See chromium: it also first saves in gnome keyring. I had to bypass it by --password-store=gnome in ~/.config/chromium-flags.conf
