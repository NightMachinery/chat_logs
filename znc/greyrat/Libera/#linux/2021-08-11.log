[03:59:31] <kfrench> Psi-Jack: I think that was because of an old cloud-init tool fighting with networkmanager.
[03:59:35] <Psi-Jack> And the only way to fix it, potentially, is detach disk, make new instance, attach disk to secondary mount point, boot, chroot in, try to see what went wrong, etc etc tetc.
[03:59:38] <esselfe> yeah with one of my providers the network interface name was changing, so vnc was the only access point
[03:59:41] <kfrench> I removed network manager and cloud-init and no more problems ;-)

[03:59:46] <Psi-Jack> kfrench: cloud-init, yes, NM, no.
[04:00:03] <Psi-Jack> nm was never installed. :/
[04:00:07] <esselfe> that's why I use the net.ifnames=0 kernel param nowadays

[04:30:14] <LadyCailin> If I use the same options as clang -v shows, it works, so the secret is in there somewhere, I would just like to understand where. However, I've realized that when I do objdump -x, that shows drastically different information that objdump -d, which only shows the _start function (and one other irrelevant one)
[04:30:40] <LadyCailin> So I guess I don't really know what the difference between -x and -d is, the man page says it shows the symbol table and relocations, but I don't really know what that means.

[15:24:15] <matsaman> DISPLAY=:0 x-related-commands-here
[15:24:34] <matsaman> or did you mean framebuffer GUI alternative to X, with mouse & whatnot?

[15:29:26] <matsaman> okay so your local does not have X?
[15:29:33] <fakuve> still I have vim installed in it and I can copy yank within the same document
[15:29:55] <matsaman> the simplest course would probably be to use screen or tmux
[15:29:58] <fakuve> but I want to copy yank across different documents , and be able to Ctrl + V in the framebuffer
[15:30:05] <fakuve> I'm using tmux as well

[15:30:30] <mion> C-shift-c,v works in most terminals
[15:30:42] <matsaman> in screen it's CTRL+a, ESC, then Vim-style hjkl to move & space bar to start selection and end, then CTRL+a, ] to paste
[15:31:06] <matsaman> here are tmux instructions, apparently: https://www.rockyourcode.com/copy-and-paste-in-tmux/
[15:31:39] <matsaman> as for gpm which you may be using with a mouse in a "framebuffer" setup? Not sure. Not likely worth figuring out over using screen/tmux.

[17:07:41] <SymbioticFemale> the arm device is running the dhcpd... when the arm device gets plugged into anything via USB, it offers up a ip address (10.0.0.1), a gateway (10.0.0.1), and then the device sets up a virtual ethernet connection and configures the route as per the DHCP info provided by the arm device. pretty standard USB ethernet emulation.

[21:54:13] <ahungry> I had a link from here some time ago that was re: postfix and anti-spam without rspamd or spamassassin - it was a feature of newer postfix versions, but I can't remember what that feature is called - anyone familiar?  Some built in postfix thing to block emails without scanning contents, but using something else (reverse DNS?) to check the legitimacy of a mail
[21:54:16] <Psi-Jack> Usually this can also cause major issues adding all the repos when you apt-get update, it may actually literally fill the minimal amount of usable storage space on the internal storage unit of the OS.

[21:58:38] <Psi-Jack> Right.
[21:58:47] <TomyWork> screen will shield its children from that
[21:58:59] <Psi-Jack> When you restart sshd, if you do it fast enough, you will not even have any interuption at all.

[22:16:27] <ayecee> eh.
[22:16:43] <hodapp> if there were any effort whatsoever to actually ask or determine what the stumbling blocks in understanding with non-native speakers were, particularly with regard to things like confusing sentence structure, sarcasm, or highly idiomatic expressions, I'd be a little more sympathetic to the rule
[22:16:48] <TJ-> the only reason for SMS abbreviations was the limited character count; which IRC most assuredly does not have!
[22:16:55] <ayecee> only in that it speaks to the age of the speaker, and not the mindset.
[22:17:08] <ayecee> TJ-: it most certainly does have that
[22:17:27] <rapha> "we here" (meaning a lot of people in my rough age bracket and social bubble in continental europe) do have strong feelings about the kind of verbal warfare that we mostly know from US TV series with regard to what constitutes "proper", "non-offensive" use of language. from our point of view it bears the danger of eroding the very foundations on which peaceful human togetherness is built.
[22:17:29] <hodapp> but as it stands now, it's an arbitrary rule with no real basis in fact, and we give a free pass to countless other things that are much more likely to confound communication
[22:17:43] <ayecee> modern irc clients will split an essay into separate posts though, and i think twitter does that too now.
[22:17:43] <TJ-> ayecee: not to the extent of charging you for each message as was the case with SMS
[22:18:22] <TJ-> originally SMS was a paid, quite expensive, add-on evne though it used spare capacity on the control circuits
[22:18:26] <ayecee> if you want to look at it that way, all rules are arbitrary.
[22:19:05] <hodapp> not really, no.
[22:19:07] <ayecee> but they also form the framework for participation in this forum.

[22:58:12] <goddard> Snap scares me
[22:58:30] <Psi-Jack> Snap is actually surprisingly designed quite well.
[22:58:46] <Psi-Jack> Flatpak.... Not so much.
[22:58:56] <goddard> Flatpak is written in C
[22:59:02] <akik> and yet flatpak is more performant
[22:59:04] <goddard> Snap is written in python
[22:59:06] <goddard> ?
[22:59:07] <Psi-Jack> And?
[22:59:13] *** Joins: RNadagoud (~RNadagoud@42.105.117.85)
[22:59:15] <Psi-Jack> Well, I'm not sure it's in python, actually.
[22:59:29] <aphos> So I'm trying to learn some kernel stuff and I want to compile a custom driver. I am able to run make on the driver source and install it, and use the device under 5.4.0-80-generic no problem. However when booting up 5.14.0-rc5+, and attempting to run make against that, it says ""ERROR: modpost: "vb2_ioctl_reqbufs" undefined!"" I double and triple checked, this symbol exists in
[22:59:29] <aphos> /lib/modules/5.14.0-rc5+/build/include/media/videobuf2-v4l2.h in the same exact spot as on the older kernel.
[22:59:38] <Psi-Jack> I know snaps use AppArmor for more stern genuine sandboxing, whereas Flatpak sandboxing is quite literaly optional.
[22:59:57] <goddard> But AppArmor can be on anything
[23:00:07] <goddard> Not really a snap thing
[23:00:59] <Psi-Jack> This is true. However, I don't think snaps could rely heavily on AppArmor the way it does, just being designed in python.
[23:01:05] <uwharrie> aphos: is that during the preprocessing, compilation, or linking step?
[23:01:14] <Psi-Jack> BUT, I cannot say I know all the ins and outs of snaps either, but I understand it's sandboxing and building techniques.
[23:01:33] <TomyWork> Psi-Jack, what's your take on snap's sandboxing?
[23:01:46] <TomyWork> nm, you replied while i was phrasing the question :D
[23:01:49] <Psi-Jack> Besides snap "legacy", it's pretty solid.

[23:02:24] <goddard> https://www.libreoffice.org/download/appimage/
[23:02:29] <TomyWork> how do they all compare to docker in terms of sandboxing?
[23:02:30] <uwharrie> aphos: because the kernel config could be slightly different, or which headers are included where could have changed
[23:02:35] <Psi-Jack> I couldn't run a snap from Rambox Pro, because their application wanted to open ~/Documents, and other $HOME directories, because mine are symlinks to /mnt/storage/$USER/$path
[23:02:51] <Psi-Jack> TomyWork: Well, snaps have actual sanboxing, unlike Docker.
[23:02:58] <Psi-Jack> That's how.
[23:03:10] <TomyWork> figured
[23:03:17] <TJ-> Psi-Jack: snaps don't share libraries

[23:13:50] <TomyWork> i hate rpm with a passion anyway. it used to be the case that the effect of a non-zero exit status in %post (i believe it was) during an upgrade was that you now had both the old and new version installed.

[23:14:07] <TJ-> yeah... I do a lot of Debian/Ubuntu packaging, mostly updating packaging of existing projects, but some greenfield. The tooling is more geared towards ensuring the eventual work product is 'correct' and ready for upload to the archives, rather than for personal use
