[01:12:11] <kfrench> If you only had 1 host, then it doesn't matter.  If you had 100 hosts, you probably don't want to copy the same package to each host.  You'd rather it just pull the package itself from a central point.

[01:13:48] <kfrench> building?  That's a whole 'nother subject.  But, if you have lots of hosts, you'll want to have some sort of central administration tool, which would include installing packages.

[01:28:00] <kfrench> I don't know if there's anything except tmux and screen.

[01:28:57] <luxidolon> and then use a term emulator that supports tabs
[01:28:59] <TheGuestMovie> Is building / installing (configure, make, make install) a source package a reasonable thing to expect non-C/C++ coders, like JS or Python coders, to be able to do in an interview, when evaluating Linux experience? Demonstrates basic reading comprehension, no?
[01:29:08] <xtp2830> rusty: most keybindings can be configured in both screen and tmux

[01:30:24] <TheGuestMovie> ayecee: here's what the INSTALL file says: https://paste.debian.net/plain/1220232
[01:30:53] <ayecee> TheGuestMovie: doesn't matter what the install file says. it's not a reasonable thing to expect a non-developer to do in an interview.
[01:31:03] <TheGuestMovie> no, they're developers, just not C or C++ developers
[01:31:18] <luxidolon> that means they are bad in several languages instead of just one
[01:31:23] <nomagno> I find many people working as programmers/sysadmins should have a more ground-level understanding of the things they use, even if just for self-cultivation.
[01:31:33] <ayecee> TheGuestMovie: will they be using the same build tools as this package does?
[01:31:41] <TheGuestMovie> In the above example, I only expect them to do "configure, make, make install". Nothing else.

[01:32:18] <TheGuestMovie> ayecee: nope. But even I as a C++ coder, dont directly use make or configure. I use a build tool which generates a makefile transparently. But OK, if this many people think it's sketchy, I'll omit it from the interview
[01:32:25] <nomagno> Well you should expect them to be able to open a README file, then

[01:36:40] <TheGuestMovie> rahl: well, they don't NEED to, since I'm here. If it's an exceptional coder I gain more from picking up their slack on the Linux side. But when interviewing I will balance programming with Linux experience, not 50/50, more like 70% coding 30% Linux.

[01:37:34] <rahl> TheGuestMovie: Oh well, worth a try ;)
[01:37:43] <ayecee> directory navigation, reading files, would be a good start
[01:37:50] <luxidolon> TheGuestMovie: are they going to be developing information systems on a team of developers or are they doing environment setup of software/services they don't actually contribute to the codebase of?
[01:38:41] <nomagno> Basic familiarity with a Unix CLI is very important if they're going to be using ANY unix-like system
[01:38:59] <nomagno> unless you're dealing with web devs on MacOS
[01:39:04] <nomagno> or something
[01:39:04] <luxidolon> basic familiarity can mean alot of things
[01:39:22] <rahl> TheGuestMovie: As for my previous statement, it's not so much that you _can_ help because you're there, it's whether you want to or feel you should have to. You have to weigh up the important skills you want them to have, and test them. It is not easy to judge to be fair. Honestly, I think challenges that truly reflect the work that would be done would be the best metric of whether someone is suitable

[01:41:20] <TheGuestMovie> luxidolon: right now I'm the only software person. I double as Linux specialist (don't laugh) and C++ developer. Obviously, hired for the latter. So I set up the system images our systems run on, I troubleshoot issues related to performance or botched systems (usually old stuff from before my time). Despite not being my primary job, this stuff
[01:41:20] <TheGuestMovie> requires Linux experience, and we hit a wall if there was no one to do it. So I value Linux experience even for developers, since it means I'm not the sole bottleneck on that stuff.

Then you realized how ridiculous it was to even go and buy a ticker, and stayed in your company. Or maybe you're right and you can predict the future!
[01:44:18] <plaane76> throw them a README and check the bash_history later to see their thought process
[01:44:30] <luxidolon> luxidolon: ideally, set up a jenkins host to monitor a repo for merges to master (or mistress, or trunk or whatever you named it) that generates an RPM from that branch using a spec file you write once, and then pushes said repo to a repo you control internally and have all your hosts pointing to in yum.repos.conf, and then your install process is just `yum upgrade $TheGuestMovieApp` and then you can

[01:55:26] <TheGuestMovie> ayecee: depends how well you structure it. Also there's architecture styles that can make it easier to tame. One I like is using events. This way components are not coupled (they're just coupled to the event). It's like adding the "when" keyword to programming, as in "when sensors report temperature above 50C, { my reaction code here }"

[03:13:53] <TJ-> jcass: your use of "print queue" seems incorrect to me. Usually, with CUPS, the PC where the printer is connected (assuming it is directly connected), you choose to "share printer" ... then it will be advertised on the network using mDNS/SSDP. Then, on other CUPS PCs, you add printer > search network and the remote CUPs shared printnr should be discovered

[04:10:11] <TJ-> Shaun: zero-pages are allocated on demand - all zero-pages point to a single page to being with
[04:10:21] <sebastorama> But think as this: you use your spare thread to compress things that is not likely to be loaded up, because is getting old in memory... Sounds a reasonably tradeoff
[04:10:44] <Dagmar> Oh a desktop, it's probably fine
[04:11:08] <Dagmar> ...as long as the desktop user isn't a developer waiting for a complex build task to complete.
[04:11:26] <Shaun> the only place I’ve actually seen zram used routinely is the raspberry pi, where disk access is so slow that anything’s an improvement

[08:39:04] <luxikopo> very_sneaky: i hope youve got a reverse proxy pass w/ apache in front of that gitlab.  if so you could just use a url rewrite with that to talk to the port that pages is on and the base url just looks like a subdirectory for pages

[08:40:07] <very_sneaky> i think this might be complicating things actually - i use my reverse proxy for tls termination but it seems like gitlab _really_ wants to do all of its own cert management

[09:54:35] <ayecee> what kind of old person joke is that
[09:54:59] <pnbeast> But if you're swapping, you should have a good reason for it - just buy enough memory if it's at all sane.

[09:58:09] <ayecee> well you'd think so but no. merely using swap doesn't slow them down.
[09:58:26] <n4dir> but to be honest, probably over the time i simply adapted my PC usage to the hardware i have got. Easy words: i don't do much
[09:58:40] <ayecee> the pages that end up in swap, they're pages that weren't being used and probably won't be used soon.

[10:01:41] <alkisg> Yeah, e.g. with 2 GB RAM you can open 2 browser tabs. If you also open libreoffice, you get the issue.
[10:01:51] <alkisg> No amount of swap will help there
[10:01:51] <ayecee> had a thinkpad with i think 512mb or 1gb ram that did that.
[10:02:28] <alkisg> The problems of swap are very well known by the kernel developers; facebook and google already have their custom solutions, and systemd-oomd tries to work around it by closing programs before a lot of swap is needed
[10:03:17] <ayecee> they're also very well known to me
[10:03:49] <n4dir> this laptop has 3 Gigs of Ram. I didn't experience it yet
[10:03:58] <ayecee> the problem there isn't that swap is being used, but that the working set, the portion being actively used, is larger than the ram.

[13:39:44] <rendar> if you consider that in the user-mode world, a kernel-mode call (a syscall) is a _VERY_ slow operation

[14:08:05] <rendar> how can i properly overwrite an user home directory?
[14:08:09] *** Joins: Strom (strom@fedora/strom)
[14:08:25] <phogg> schillingklaus: in a microkernel, for example, your filesystem driver is probably not kernel code. There are about a million lines in Linux that have to do with filesystems.
[14:08:47] <phogg> rendar: you can't overwrite a directory. You can mv it or rm it and then make a new directory.
[14:08:53] <phogg> or just rm its contents
[14:09:18] <rendar> phogg, nope, i want to overwrite the user's default home directory path
[14:09:20] <schillingklaus> or you can mount something to it
[14:09:23] <rendar> not the directory itself
[14:09:39] <rendar> basic way is usermod -d, but: sudo: usermod: command not found
[14:10:15] <phogg> rendar: also, in answer to your question in #bash you could do this (if you have GNU chmod): chmod -R a=rX.u=rwX /data/*

[18:09:59] <TJ-> how does hardware break hibernation (resuming from)? Hibernation works by booting the device as normal but the kernel looks for a hibernation file with a good signature and if it finds it, loads it into RAM, and then unfreezes userspace the same way as S3 suspend/resume

[18:10:51] <vapre> i was trying out gpgsm, i signed a message and after was able to verify the signed message. does a signed (not encrypted) message contain the original message content? how else can you verify without the original plain content?
[18:10:54] <bruda> TJ-: fair question. So what would you assume would prevent proper loading of the environment, such as KDE & open apps, back to its properly state?
[18:11:55] <bruda> Because when I hibernate it's slow to shut down. When the system loads back up it's as if I came back from a shutdown rather than hibernation.
[18:12:13] <bruda> None of my apps open, etc.
[18:13:03] <TJ-> bruda: i'd first check the kernel log to see if it /is/doing a resume from hibernation - it sounds like that isn't happening. Sometimes that is due to the initialramfs not having the correct RESUME= device set
[18:13:27] <TJ-> bruda: if I recall correctly, the kernel should have a line reporting the loading of the hibernation image

[20:11:57] <naptastic> Guest76, Debian itself doesn't publish any live environments (at least, they didn't used to?) so it's probably a fork of Debian, and the difference probably doesn't matter but it might. What does the output of `lsb_release -a` tell you?

[20:49:01] <naptastic> jeremy31, it depends on what program is managing your network. I use the ISC DHCP client, which totally overwrites /etc/resolv.conf on every run. If it's a symlink to someplace in /run, I think systemd is managing things.

[23:12:18] <drew> when I forward a local port to a remote port over ssh with something like `client1$ ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 host`, I can access port host:8080 on localhost:8080, but if I try to access that port on client1 from client2 on the same local network, I can't access it.

[23:48:52] <knotMez> well I'm not sure if it works for stereo I know there's output
[23:48:59] <[[R]]> this even talks about doing 5.1 spdif

[23:49:09] <knotMez> that's what i do
[23:49:19] <knotMez> SPDIF to 5.1
[23:49:28] <[[R]]> yeah... i did speakertest a millino times

[23:50:53] <knotMez> doesn't even seem like speakertest is available in the repo anymore
[23:50:53] <SineDeviance> anyone here use a tiling wm?
[23:51:06] <Inline> what is netmount for ?
[23:51:10] <tangy> occasionally
[23:51:18] <tangy> i3
[23:51:28] <SineDeviance> if so, can I ask you a question? what is it about tiling wms that hooked you? I've tried a few but I just don't see the appeal
[23:51:38] <Inline> ooh, network filesystems
[23:51:46] <knotMez> SineDeviance tiling wms are for edge lords
[23:52:13] <MrElendig> SineDeviance: too lazy to manage the windows manually
[23:52:19] <knotMez> if they had any real balls they'd just use twm and be done with it

[23:52:57] <msiism> I use a stacking window manager, but with pseudo-tiling features that I utilize quite a lot.
[23:53:26] <knotMez> if i want tiling I'll go in the bathroom
[23:54:01] <SineDeviance> msiism: by stacking window manager, I assume you mean 'regular' window managers like xfwm4 or Windows' dwm?
[23:54:29] <msiism> SineDeviance: Yeah, like, those things that just stack window on top of another when they overlap – sort of.
[23:54:34] <knotMez> I like focus follows mouse and autoraise with delay myself
[23:54:53] <tangy> well, i like a challenge, for starterrs. the speed of switching between terminals, faster login times, super low use of resources...  but you can get a similar experience without X with screen or tmux. the wm's are prettier, though.
[23:55:01] <knotMez> instant auto raise is a bit much
[23:55:07] <alkisg> I too have that question... isn't the window/edge snapping of the other window managers enough? I never want to arrange more than 4 windows in my screen anyway (one in each of the edges...)

[23:55:31] <SineDeviance> alkisg: yeah, that's kinda how I feel about it
[23:55:44] <SineDeviance> If I need more than four windows on one display, the answer is more displays, not more windows
[23:56:06] <knotMez> alkisg there are people that just seem to launch every program on their PC

[23:58:06] <msiism> For ore than a coupld of windows I prefer a window selection menu over hitting Atl+Tab.
[23:58:26] <knotMez> I've never used a tiling WM but just the idea of my windows getting automatically resized is not something i want

[23:59:20] <msiism> Yeah, exactly.
[23:59:31] <msiism> Except for exceptional cases.
[23:59:48] <knotMez> I've gone as far as setting default geometry for some applications
[23:59:53] <tangy> when upstream switched from i3 to sway I got distracted. I didn't have time for getting into wayland at the time. focus follows mouse was super conenient, imo,
