[00:01:08] <KillerWasp> if you don't use a float value you're exiled from any programming community. *SIGH*
[00:01:34] <ProfSimm> Talking about methods.
[00:01:53] <ProfSimm> why do we have object.method(arg, arg, arg) and not object(method, arg, arg, arg)

[00:02:30] <ProfSimm> KillerWasp: functions in C aren't instances
[00:02:40] <KillerWasp> also you can use the first method in C, only if you're use callback functions.
[00:03:27] <ProfSimm> Question is why is the popular OOP syntax what it is
[00:03:46] <ProfSimm> SmallTalk for example has named arguments, and no method names per se
[00:03:57] <ProfSimm> The argument names are the method names
[00:04:23] <KillerWasp> ProfSimm: I don't know, I guess because it's more understandable and more abstract, as if the function belongs to the object.
[00:05:04] <ProfSimm> KillerWasp: that's just the retroactive justification we have now for it. Technically all methods can be seen as one overloaded function

[01:26:34] <vdamewood> In fact, I don't think Mandarin has any voiced stops, africates, or fricatives.
[01:26:37] <apotheon> I think Pinyin has confused me so much I don't even recall the pronunciations at all.
[01:26:52] <apotheon> I just know that Wade-Giles was very systematic and easy.
[01:27:02] <vdamewood> apotheon: Naw, Pinyin uses 'voiced' consonants for unaspirated consonants.
[01:27:15] <vdamewood> p <-- Aspirated; b <-- unaspirated
[01:27:16] <apotheon> You could apply the same rule for a special character across a wide range of different letters and be pretty accurate in Wade-Giles.
[01:27:42] <vdamewood> Pinyin is systematic, too, it's just a different system.
[01:28:15] <apotheon> It has more fuzzy areas, though, because of the way letters are actually used in most Latin alphabet languages.
[01:28:37] <vdamewood> I'm not quite sure what you mean by that.
[01:28:59] <apotheon> Wade Giles used modifiers that applied to basically everything, so one rarely had to guess which pronunciation of a given letter or combination of letters was used.

[01:38:03] <vdamewood> pyzozord: "Okay, everyone's heard of this. Move on to paragraph n, unless you really haven't." or something like that.
[01:38:25] <ProfSimm> what is the distinction between apply and eval in functional programming I wonder
[01:38:45] <vdamewood> apotheon: c is pronounced like k in Italian when it's not followed by a vowel, or is followed by a, o, or u.
[01:39:12] <vdamewood> apotheon: Basically, Italian pronounes c as tʃ when English would pronounce it as s.
[01:39:34] <apotheon> vdamewood: I thought you were originally saying that, because c is unvoiced and z is voiced in English usage, c is aspirated and z is unaspirated in Pinyin.
[01:39:57] <apotheon> . . . which seems to match up with what you said when apparently correcting your earlier statement, so to me it looks like you corrected it by rephrasing exactly the same answer.
[01:40:07] <vdamewood> apotheon: I was thinking about p/b and ch/j, but it kind of breaks up after a few others.
[01:40:16] <apotheon> vdamewood: The "like k" is why I said Italian got it *half* right.

[01:46:14] <ProfSimm> ski: I think you're referring to the JS function, I mean in more abstract sense
[01:46:25] <pyzozord> ski: lisp is closer, but it has to have explicit feature that actually governs the entire language
[01:46:32] <ski> the point is that these `eval' and `apply', being mutually recursive, is not really a part of the language, but part of the implementation of the language
[01:46:35] <ski> however
[01:46:39] <ski> ProfSimm : no
[01:46:44] <apotheon> c = ch (tʃ); k = k; s = s (for English)
[01:46:55] <jubegnx> Čeet
[01:46:58] <apotheon> ts should just be ts
[01:47:00] <vdamewood> Well, actually, we can't, because latin didn't have a tʃ sound.
[01:47:29] <vdamewood> apotheon: So why not just use tsh for tʃ?
[01:47:33] <duuude> are you french jubegnx?
[01:47:44] <pyzozord> vdamewood: tsh?
[01:47:45] <apotheon> because that's not how ch is pronounced
[01:47:55] <apotheon> it's not tsh
[01:48:03] <pyzozord> ch?
[01:48:03] <ski> `eval' and `apply' can also be provided as operations in the language itself. then `eval' is a meta-programming primitive, and `apply' is a primitive for calling a function with a run-time computed argument list. but from this standpoint, `eval' and `apply' aren't really related to each other. they're just two library operations (possibly primitive)
[01:48:05] <jubegnx> serbian
[01:48:15] <duuude> it is tcsh
[01:48:23] <apotheon> That's a shell.
[01:48:28] <vdamewood> apotheon: It is. t is t, and sh is ʃ, so tsh is tʃ
[01:48:33] <duuude> yeah, and not tsh
[01:48:40] <apotheon> ugh
[01:48:42] <nomagno> apotheon: you're having a cross-language analysis of how letters relate to sounds?
[01:48:43] <nomagno> That's kinda useless
[01:48:45] <ski> (Lisps tend to have `eval' and `apply' as operations in the language itself, yea)
[01:48:47] <jubegnx> (CH)eat    čeat 
[01:49:00] <apotheon> I can only assume that vdamewood doesn't speak with native English speakers much.
[01:49:01] <nomagno> The latin alphabet isn't even used in latin-descended languages exclusively
[01:49:12] <vdamewood> apotheon: I do. As I live in the US.
[01:49:15] <pyzozord> in general eval can run any code, like assignment, apply can only call functions
[01:49:21] <apotheon> tʃ is an approximation
[01:49:35] <nomagno> The letters NEED to adapt beyond their original phonemes
[01:49:38] <apotheon> for all the hype, ipa is bad at representing a lot of linguistic norms
[01:49:52] <duuude> ʃʃʃʃʃʃʃʃ

[01:50:40] <vdamewood> apotheon: Seems to be right to me, except for the tie for making it a proper affricate.
[01:50:42] <apotheon> I never have a hard t at the beginning of "chair", and neither does anyone I've met who doesn't sound subtly weird when speaking in that respect -- which is probably a grand total of two people in my life.
[01:50:51] <pyzozord> duuude: change your mind
[01:50:54] <nomagno> I'm unsure how eval is meant to work honestly
[01:50:55] <ski> "returns closure" -- no, returns a value (by which i mean, the representation of values, in the interpreter. if the value is a function value, then this would typically be represented as a closure, in the interpreter)
[01:51:12] <ProfSimm> ski: so both run things, why mutually recursive
[01:51:24] * duuude changes mind
[01:51:30] <apotheon> If you want a hard t, you want patch, and even that has ch being rather drier/sharper than sh.
[01:51:32] <vdamewood> apotheon: What do you mean by 'hard' t?
[01:51:38] <apotheon> "tsh"
[01:51:40] <apotheon> hard t
[01:51:41] <nomagno> Self-modifying code is a very complex thingy
[01:51:43] <apotheon> a t sound
[01:51:57] <nomagno> I can hardly wrap my head around it in the context of programming language eval()
[01:51:58] <vdamewood> I pronounce the 'tch' in patch and 'ch' in chair the same.
[01:52:01] <apotheon> with the tip of the tongue touching near the front of the palate before the ch part
[01:52:15] <apotheon> vdamewood: That's sloppy.
[01:52:29] <nitrix> chair without the t leads to share.
[01:52:33] <nitrix> You need the t.
[01:52:40] <ski> `eval' branches on the kind of expression. if it's a function call, it recursively evaluates the operator (/function) expression, and all the operand (/argument) expressions, then calls `apply' on the resulting values. `apply' checks that the first (operator) value is a closure, extends the environment by binding the formal parameters in the closure to the actual parameters (the parameter values), and 
[01:52:46] <ski> then calls `eval' on the body/definiens expression of the closure
[01:52:56] <ski> ProfSimm : there's your mutual recursion ^
[01:53:08] <apotheon> I think this must be a distinction for people who learned to speak late, or learned from people who learned to speak late, and didn't develop early crispness when needed.
[01:53:32] <vdamewood> English is my native language.
[01:53:34] <ski> (of course, there's other cases in `eval' as well, e.g. variable, lambda, and probably primitive operations, and literal)
[01:54:31] * duuude makes tcsh sounds
[01:54:46] <apotheon> The sound at the beginning of "chair" starts once the tip of the tongue is no longer touching the roof of the mouth.  Adding the t means you get an aspiration from the tip of the tongue touching and transition to the rest of it, almost like a plosive.
[01:54:48] <ski> nomagno : why would `eval' emply self-modifying code ? or maybe that's not what you meant ?
[01:55:08] <ski> s/emply/employ/
[01:55:15] <apotheon> vdamewood: I'm not talking about ESL, I'm talking about learning to speak it later in development or learning from examples provided by people who learned it later.
[01:55:25] <ProfSimm> ski:  thanks. 
[01:55:57] <pyzozord> I thought I was making only "ch" sound, but upon closer investigation I think I too make tsh in patch
[01:56:05] <apotheon> Standard accentless trained news media accent in the US, before that stopped being a thing, was more crisp and less prone to blending differing-but-similar sounds.
[01:56:26] <ski> ProfSimm : of course, nothing prevents you from inlining this `apply' into `eval'
[01:56:26] <apotheon> pyzozord: In patch it should be "tch", not "ch" or "tsh".
[01:56:40] <vdamewood> There's no such thing as 'accentless'
[01:56:49] <apotheon> The "ch", as I said, should be crisper than "sh" but without the t-style pre-aspiration effect.
[01:57:33] <apotheon> vdamewood: You clearly don't know what I'm talking about.  There's a reason I called it an accentless *accent*; it's meant to be as bland and neutral as possible.

[01:57:45] <pyzozord> if you speak fast noone notices
[01:57:50] <apotheon> I'm not using the term in a technical sense when I say "accentless" about an accent.
[01:57:54] <pyzozord> unless they are native speaker
[01:58:38] <pyzozord> i say that only because I'm not sure if I got them right :P
[01:59:05] <ski> anyway, `eval' and `apply', seen in this light, are implementation details of an interpreter. providing `eval' and `apply' as operations in the language itself, is conceptually a separate thing (first being a meta-operation, the second being a "call with arbitrary number of arguments" operations). of course, in many (at least simpler) Lisp interpreters, the latter `eval' and `apply' could be directly 
[01:59:06] <apotheon> I'd like to see certain things from UK English combine with certain things from US English, but unfortunately we seem to be getting the opposite; only the least clear stuff from each is becoming normalized.
[01:59:11] <vdamewood> apotheon: Oh, I knew what you were talking ab out, the General American media accent.
[01:59:11] <ski> implemented as just calling the former `eval' and `apply'. which might account for some of the confusion
[01:59:37] <apotheon> vdamewood: Were you just trying to derail my point, then?
[01:59:48] <vdamewood> apotheon: But referring to something as 'accentless' has roots in in elitism and racism.
[02:00:00] <apotheon> holy shit
[02:00:12] <apotheon> I'm not going to have this "look for ways to demonize each other" discussion.
[02:00:15] <apotheon> 'bye

[02:11:20] <vdamewood> inhahe_ ProfSimm: Though, to be fair, Visual Basic does use () for both array subscripting, and function calling and it works.
[02:12:24] <vdamewood> The way VB does it is that it applies function calling to functions, and array indexing to arrays, because it's already read Dim Foo, or Function Foo, somewhere else in the code.

[06:18:00] <amigojapan> Right KillerWasp Japanese is also based on the Roman god's
[06:18:11] <vdamewood> amigojapan: Not the Roman gods. Just the planets.
[06:18:19] <amigojapan> KillerWasp: it's all codified in sailor moon
[06:18:38] <epony> the Roman mythologies are repeating the Greek ones with changed names (rebranding)
[06:18:46] <amigojapan> vdamewood: ok but it is in sailor moon, related
[06:18:51] <vdamewood> Really, the only planets that have names remotely like the roman gods are Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto if it's considered.

[06:23:47] <amigojapan> Decker: Catholicism has always absorbed pagan things
[06:23:49] <vdamewood> Decker: Well, for some reason, when the Christians brought their calanders, the speakers of Proto-English used their own god's names for the days, except Saturn for some reason.

[06:24:43] <KillerWasp> A long time ago I had the strange idea that it occurred to me that Mars is related to war, because the aliens used the planet as a military base to send all their warships to attack the planet Earth in their early conquest, and on Saturn it is where the tree of life is hidden among the clouds in a habitable space for life.
[06:24:57] <amigojapan> Decker: yeah
[06:25:08] <epony> and domain names are numbers too ;-) but phone numbers are.. regional
[06:26:01] <KillerWasp> related to tree of apple in the bible, or the tree deep in the dimension where there is a dragon chewing on its roots.
[06:26:53] <KillerWasp> A secluded dimension as something metaphorical that it is very secluded and hidden.

[10:21:30] <Decker> you get like a onmessage callback and can .post messages to them  (and vice vsersa from their perspective)
[10:22:18] <Decker> Also using modules with import/exprot as service workers doesn't work (has to be built into a single JS blob); there are also webworkers, which can load more stuff - but they don't get the features of service workers (which can hook into the fetch API for example)

[12:30:08] <pyzozord> well nevermind ignore my last sentence
[12:30:08] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: thinking about syntax a lone is superficial yes. But checking syntax from time to time as you work on other things is a sanity check
[12:30:24] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: say if you model arrays as just functions all the above becomes natural, including named dimensions
[12:30:30] <pyzozord> yeah, it's kind all syntactic sugar all the way down to machine code
[12:30:34] <Decker> [1][2] is 2 expressions... the second indexer operating on the result of the former... you can't [1,?] for those have multi-indexers as a parameter - syntax matters a lot in that
[12:30:44] <ProfSimm> But also implies that stuff like this needs special consideration:  array[10] = 20
[12:30:45] <pyzozord> so drawing any line would be kind of arbitrary
[12:30:57] <ProfSimm> How does one assign a result to a function :P
[12:31:08] <Decker> as a setter
[12:31:19] <Decker> it takes an additional parameter that's the value to set
[12:31:25] <ProfSimm> Decker: N-dimensional array is not necessarily an array nested in an array
[12:31:50] <Decker> right; the index function can do anything it wants with the value
[12:31:52] <Decker> s
[12:32:27] <pyzozord> kind of depends what you can do with an array, if you can expand it then they must be probably actually nested
[12:32:41] <Decker> but you get get(int i,int j, int k) and set(int i, int j, int k, Type val ) 
[12:32:50] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: depends. True arrays are not resizable, they're blocks of memory
[12:32:53] <Decker> set returns void, get returns Type
[12:32:55] <DPA> In C, it is possible to do stuff like  void func(int n, int m, int x[n][m]){ x[1][2] }. The x passed to the function can be a simple pointer, which could also have originated from an array of different dimensions.
[12:32:57] <ProfSimm> pyzozord: but you can do anything i guess

[12:48:57] <DPA> The names are always for indeces, right? That can be done in C, kinda, although it's a bit ub:  union labeled_array { struct { int _1, _2, a, b; }; int _[10] }; Then labeled_array.a is the same as labeled_array._[2], usually.
[12:49:02] <ProfSimm> let result = [[]]   vs   let result = thing [[]]
[12:49:28] <inhahe_> ok, just like in python
[12:49:39] <ProfSimm> DPA: the names are a side-effect of having names in arrays (associative maps) and using arrays as argument lists

[13:03:35] <DPA> That sounds like lazy evaluation, but I don't get how that's like reduce. Who makes requests the continuations or who provides them? Where is the reduction happening?
[13:04:52] <DPA> I'm having trouble picturing the control flow.
[13:05:04] <ProfSimm> DPA: every expression chain has an interpreter function at the root, that's implicit, not in the syntax, but there in the AST. It gets everything from the chain as arguments, and gets told to eval whenever the parent interpreter wants to eval
[13:05:56] <ProfSimm> DPA: foo bar baz <-- this is an expression chain, same as    interpreter(foo, bar, baz)
[13:06:21] <ProfSimm> DPA: those are two expression chains in an array [foo bar baz, x y z]
[13:07:35] <ProfSimm> DPA: typically the interpreter takes the first argument and delegates to it the rest of the arguments. So in "foo bar baz" foo becomes the handler of bar/baz. 
[13:08:28] <ProfSimm> DPA: to be more accurate it takes the first argument, and if it's a name it resolves the name against the local scope bindings first

[13:27:15] <ProfSimm> DPA:  i.e. in LISP you'd probably have  (add 1 2). In this you also can have (add 1 2), but the convention is add [1, 2]
[13:27:56] <ProfSimm> DPA: i.e. the [1, 2] is a tuple that's the single argument you get, any arguments after it form a "chain". The receive of the previous argument decides who receives the rest of the chain (itself or something else)

[16:22:09] <suss> or rustc that is one of build-chains of rust.
[16:22:25] <koollman> because the rust compiler needs a working rust compiler, and it needs a recent one, too :)
[16:23:23] <GeDaMo> Does it have any way to bootstrap it from something else?
[16:23:32] <bnchs> i wish there was a rust compiler using gcc

[16:24:41] <GeDaMo> A cut down Rust compiler?
[16:24:43] <jumpArtifact> Yeah, using "cargo" for compiling Rust programs always expects you to have a network connection to be able to pull in dependencies (and keep an up to date record of crates on crates.io)
[16:25:11] <GeDaMo> https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc "Capable of building a fully-working copy of rustc, but not suitable for everyday use (due to terrible error messages)."

[16:25:22] <bnchs> rust is centralized on cargo?
[16:25:30] <bnchs> thats one con over c
[16:26:16] <jumpArtifact> people can publish "crates" on crates.io . You can specify dependencies in a "Cargo.toml" file in your project's root, and "cargo" can fetch and build dependencies for you when you invoke a "cargo build" on your Rust project. It can also set up a project from scratch.
[16:27:01] <bnchs> yes but it's also centralized in that fact
[16:27:07] <jumpArtifact> yes
[16:27:23] <jumpArtifact> I think there is support for non-standard repos though
[16:27:38] <jumpArtifact> for instance, a company may have their own repository of crates that are closed source or something
[16:27:53] <jumpArtifact> but you'd have to muck around in config
[16:28:02] <suss> GeDamo wait, what's the '\' of '\0' if the 0 is 0 as it either isnt count in the length of, or isnt' printed that '\' should be have a hex byte stored in memory.
[16:28:08] <jumpArtifact> I don't remember how difficult the process is, maybe it's not as bad as I think
[16:28:38] <GeDaMo> suss: the \ is an escape character

[17:15:06] <inhahe_> at least in python, i forget the actual definition of tuple
[17:15:12] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: I don't know. We have associative tuples where order doesn't matter. For the numerically indexed tuples, order matters only because the index is ordered, not the values

[17:17:34] <ProfSimm> inhahe_: it makes it when you compare it to a linked list, for example. There the values form the list, the order, and the index is DERIVED from the order the values link to each other.
[17:17:53] <ProfSimm> inhahe: in a tuple and an array, it's the other way around. You have an index, and you derive order by indexing in the order of the keys
[17:18:24] <ProfSimm> inhahe: you can also derive it in reverse if you want. Same deal. But in linked list you can't. Unless it's doubly linked.

[17:18:55] <ProfSimm> merijn: the definition of tuple varies a bit. I considered tuples to be basically streams with no index for a while, like in Haskell

[17:19:34] <merijn> ProfSimm: Tuples aren't remotely similar to streams, though, in Haskell
[17:19:37] <jumpArtifact> though I often end up deciding, "A struct is better than a tuple in this case"
[17:19:50] <merijn> More like structs where the attributes have no name
[17:20:01] <ProfSimm> merijn: but bytes ordered in memory aren't really ordered. The index is an abstraction. (1,2,3)... 1 can be on one chip, 2 on another and 3 on yet another
[17:20:26] <ProfSimm> merijn: so is there some inherent order here, aside from the index, I don't think so
[17:21:16] <ProfSimm> merijn: works same way on an SSD. it seems like an ordered linear space, but isn't
[17:21:27] <ProfSimm> So the order is just a convention by means of the index you use to access a location

[17:22:52] *** Joins: dunkeln (~dunkeln@user/dunkeln)
[17:25:23] <merijn> ProfSimm: There is no "gain" it's just that tuples are structural (thus ordered) but there is no indexing them

[17:26:27] <merijn> "\tup -> case tup of (a, _) -> print a"
[17:27:00] <merijn> You can't have 100 item tuples anyway. The standard only requires up to, like, 16 I think and GHC only implements tuples up to 63 elements
[17:27:08] <ProfSimm> Where's the 50 here
[17:27:12] <merijn> Because, if your tuple needs 64 or more, you already done fucked up somewhere

[21:30:28] <bjs> GeDaMo: if there was a "start of list" symbol maybe it'd actually matter which way around you thought about it

[21:30:36] <GeDaMo> Lisp is lists, 'linked list' is a possible concrete implementation

[21:31:10] <flakland> nothing like arrays then
[21:31:12] <bjs> GeDaMo: that's a super pedantic point, and some can argue there aren't even lists, only pairs
[21:31:24] <ProfSimm> flakland: are you saying I can't make a tuple of 10 ints?
[21:31:34] <ProfSimm> flakland: because I can. So what does it mean "nothing like"
[21:31:45] <ProfSimm> flakland: arrays are a subtype of typles
[21:31:46] <ProfSimm> tuples
[21:31:49] <flakland> empty array still makes no sense, as well as empty string.

[21:49:57] <ProfSimm> GeDaMo: but what's a jump table 
[21:50:00] <bjs> ProfSimm: well switch/case is usually some kind of branch table
[21:50:04] <flakland> hey random thousand insects guy , do you know any good chiptune compilations?
[21:50:06] <GeDaMo> An array of function pointers
[21:50:17] <ProfSimm> GeDaMo: you still need to decide which to call
[21:50:20] <KillerWasp> i get like 230 music for my games, and i still don't reach the 1% of all the musics that i need listen. :S

[21:50:43] <ProfSimm> GeDaMo: yes, we need to decide what value is
[21:50:50] <bjs> ProfSimm: that's the thing you switch() on
[21:50:57] <sonny> at an abstract level a switch is implemented with a simple hash function, or you could call it a dictionary I guess
[21:51:00] <ProfSimm> bjs: are you saying it's a hashmap?
[21:51:01] <GeDaMo> In C, a switch value is usually an integer
[21:51:03] <bjs> ProfSimm: no
[21:51:08] <ProfSimm> So what is it
[21:51:19] <bjs> ProfSimm: switch (v) { case 1: case 2: case 3: ... etc}  then you use `v` to jump directly to the case
[21:51:30] <bjs> e.g. maybe you make each case take 10 bytes, then you jump to here+10*v
[21:51:31] <novns> KillerWasp, you need to hire special trained music listeners

[21:53:01] <sonny> it's a direct mapping
[21:53:12] <sonny> there's no slots in your example
[21:53:22] <deniska> modern C compiler probably uses the same machinery to compile if-else and switch-case
[21:53:25] <GeDaMo> The compiler can still implement conditional branches
[21:53:26] <bjs> ProfSimm: well C compilers have lots of tricks to try be better by figuring out bitshifts and stuff

[21:54:40] <Angs> Does anyone have an experience reviewing code quality of a project? I wonder what are the important aspects to evaluate if the code base has a high,meduim or low quality. If that project is good or bad interms of maintainability, and investing future time on it? What comes to my mind is to check if the code use any coding standard (like clang, google etc.), use static analyzer and linter to see how many issues it has, check unit tests and code 
[21:54:40] <Angs> coverage, if it has CI/CD, documentation quality, if the code is written in a simple or complex. If it is possible, then use dynamic analyzer, profiler, and check memory leaks. Check version controlling and how the codes have been commited. What else can be checked? I am interested in Linux based C++ embedded project.
[21:54:52] <bjs> ProfSimm: I mean you can use godbolt or something and just try some C switch examples and see how a modern compiler actually does it
[21:55:18] <bjs> I suspect it'll try as hard as it possibly can to make a jump table, possibly with some bitfiddling to reduce the set of slots down
[21:55:21] <ProfSimm> sonny: implement a jump table for bunch of random strings for me
[21:55:29] <Angs> checking the build system is another thing to add for sure
[21:56:04] <sonny> ProfSimm: I've seen how a pattern matcher can be implemented, in a high level language
[21:56:17] <sonny> it's just conditionals all the way down
[21:56:26] <bjs> ProfSimm: if it can't manage a jump table "efficiently" enough, then it probably will fall back on just a sequence of `if`s

[22:01:19] <ProfSimm> bjs: my problem is that I came up with a way to call one of two continuations (branches) automatically in regular expressions, like  foo & bar | qux. Foo will call bar or qux based on whether it failed or succeed

[22:34:41] <Angs> rindolf, as you wrote, it's better to have less dependencies, but no need to re-invent the wheel. It sounds like a hard trade-off if using 3rd party good or bad.

[23:34:31] <GeDaMo> Honestly, I missed that it used sed :P
[23:34:54] <pyzozord> really? :D
[23:35:18] <pyzozord> the sed part is pretty crazy, I didn't know regexes can be turing complete
[23:35:39] <pyzozord> I thought by definition finite state automata have less power than turing machines

[23:46:33] <ConCarne> hi all, can someone help me on how to start learning GUI development that goes with C language and is beginner friendly
[23:46:52] <sonny> sure, first thing is to pick a library
[23:47:25] <Decker> design a library
[23:47:43] <GeDaMo> Pick a peck of pickled peppers :P

[23:48:18] <jeaye> Beginner-friendly C GUI dev? eek
[23:48:38] <jeaye> ConCarne: Have you looked into GTK?
[23:49:17] <pyzozord> ConCarne: for videogame oriented stuff imgui might be quite easy
[23:49:56] <ConCarne> jeaye: my college starts intro to programming with C so.. i thought begin with that.. GTK and the like they all seem so daunting 
[23:50:17] <jeaye> GUI programming in C is daunting.
[23:50:20] <pyzozord> you will probably find simplw gui libraries written for SDL
[23:50:24] <sonny> yep
[23:50:46] <sonny> ConCarne: I have a guide for windows gui programming if you are interested
[23:50:59] <sonny> there's also a gtk guide on their docs website
[23:51:12] <sonny> enlightment also is a gui library in C
[23:51:14] <pyzozord> hlpw_window or whatever windows is doing with it's library

[23:53:21] <sonny> oh yeah, there's also motif
[23:53:25] <pyzozord> ConCarne: give them K&R book
[23:53:45] <pyzozord> that's the best way to start with c in my opinion
[23:54:01] <sonny> K&R isn't an intro programming book :P
[23:54:12] <sonny> but yeah it's pretty good
[23:54:20] <sonny> they already threw you in the deep end
[23:54:49] <pyzozord> K&R is an intro book
[23:54:59] <sonny> they say so themselves 
[23:55:15] <sonny> "we expect you to know a programming language already"
[23:55:20] <sonny> or something like that

[23:58:15] <pyzozord> it's an intro book, everybody knows what a variable and a loop is nowadays
[23:58:25] <sonny> I didn't
[23:58:28] <pyzozord> it classes are mandatory in highchool
[23:58:46] <sonny> I didn't do programming until my intro to programming in C in uni
