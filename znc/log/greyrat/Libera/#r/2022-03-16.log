[00:10:39] <velix> confuzeus: yes, it's a nice website. way too many ads.
[00:10:52] <velix> confuzeus: try it for yourself: google.com
[00:11:26] <confuzeus> lol. got tonnes of adblockers...
[00:20:35] <Bayes> velix https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html
[00:20:41] <Bayes> this one doesn't have ads :P
[00:20:53] <Bayes> assuming you're talking about manipulating libre office /files/
[00:27:36] <velix> Bayes: yes, sorry. Thanks, I didn't find this while looking.
[00:27:46] <Bayes> np velix
[00:28:12] <velix> By the way: I've contributed to openxlsx in the past. I'm heavily using it :D
[00:28:20] <Bayes> oh that's great <3
[00:28:31] <Bayes> it's cool that microsoft moved onto a more open format
[00:28:46] <velix> Bayes: Actually, the Microsoft format was open before ODT was open :D
[00:28:58] <Bayes> oh really?
[00:29:09] <Bayes> I had it backwards myself
[00:29:13] <Bayes> TIL :D
[00:29:32] <velix> Yeah. Microsoft also used Office XML before. Which is a flat file format.
[00:29:41] <velix> Like FODT.
[00:29:59] <velix> you can edit stuff just with SED ;)
[00:30:05] <velix> or xml-transformation.
[00:30:24] <velix> I once wrote template enging using shell only. It created bills.
[00:30:52] <velix> The problem is the interpretation of the open formats.
[00:31:02] <velix> Like CSS, SVG and others: the interpretation is different all the time.
[00:31:17] <velix> Even PDF and PS are different in any interpretor.
[00:31:23] <velix> SVG interpretation is a mess.
[00:31:31] <velix> And SVG2 never made it.
[00:37:38] <velix> Bayes: I've said "thanks" to quick. There's no library to manipulare libre office /files/
[00:40:57] <twrk> https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readODS/versions/1.7.0/topics/read_ods ?
[00:41:23] <velix> twrk: "read" !== "manipulate" ;)
[00:41:27] <velix> boolean false
[00:41:28] <twrk> oh, manipulate... welp, reading is the first step. time to make the library then :^), (like openxlsx)
[00:41:40] <velix> twrk: "XLSX" !== "ODT"
[00:41:42] <velix> man ;)
[00:41:46] <velix> boolean false.
[00:41:57] <twrk> aka, take the cpp library, use rcpp magics, import into r
[00:42:09] <twrk> or java
