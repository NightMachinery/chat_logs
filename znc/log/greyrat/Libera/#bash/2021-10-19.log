[00:47:38] <thebombzen> either way, your best solution is probably to just have a log file and use fs.write() yourself
[00:47:44] <pj> it's a node problem, then.  I suspect that node, being largely an event-driven language, is simply not able to output the "end" before it exits from the process.exit
[00:47:53] <gajus> thebombzen: the problem is that I also need ability to tail real-time program output
[00:48:13] <thebombzen> I fail to see how writing to a file makes this an issue

[00:48:36] <thebombzen> then just do that
[00:48:48] <greycat> But redirection to a *pipe* does change it?  How odd.  Sounds like a question for whatever the node channel is.
[00:48:48] <thebombzen> you can read from a file that's open in another process without issue unless you are on Windows

[00:56:21] <eggbean> Bash's array element removal seems to be something that could be improved. Why is it like this when adding elements is much neater?

[03:23:42] <greycat> Most regular expression tools operate on lines.  Not files.  ^ matches the start of a line, not the start of a file, or a stanza.
[03:24:16] <greycat> Stop using regexes for things they don't do well.  Just read line by line.  If a line is blank, do something.  Otherwise, do something else.

[04:52:36] <greycat> Then again, with an array of lines you'd probably just use a for loop and no redirection is needed at all.

[06:38:22] <greybot> The backquote (`) is used in the old-style command substitution, e.g. foo=`command`. The foo=$(command) syntax is recommended instead. Backslash handling inside $() is less surprising, and $() is easier to nest. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082

[13:27:39] <Payam> hi, I use git for revision stuff. and sometime when you set a tag and do `git describe --tags´ you only get the latest tag and no commits if there isn't any commit yet.
[13:28:30] <Payam> so what I want to do is if [[ $(git describe --tags) == only_the_tag_and_nothing_else ]]; then
[13:28:55] <Payam> I don't know how to formulize the only_the_tag_and_nothing_else  in this context
[13:32:15] <lopid> one line? wc?
[13:32:36] <geirha> [[ $(git describe --tags) != *-g+([[:xdigit:]]) ]]
[13:34:05] <Payam> what does *-g+([[:xdigit:]])  mean
[13:34:27] <geirha> equivalent to the regex -g[[:xdigit:]]+$
[13:34:54] <geirha> if it's a commit after a tag, it will end with -g followed by 7 hex digits
[13:35:37] <geirha> v1.0.0 vs  v1.0.0-2-gc0ffee1
[13:36:02] <Payam> for instance this : v1.2.1-84-g6110a3b
[13:36:18] *** Quits: grettke (~grettke@cpe-65-29-228-30.wi.res.rr.com) (Quit: My MacBook has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[13:36:18] <Payam> and if the version is v1.2.1 only
[13:36:50] <Payam> okej You got a * there
[13:37:00] <ormaaj> Nice use of xdigit
[13:37:02] <geirha> right, so v1.2.1-84-g6110a3b will match the (ext)glob *0g+([[:xdigit:]])
[13:37:26] <geirha> gah, *-g+([[:xdigit:]])  don't know how that - became a 0
[13:38:33] <geirha> *-*-g* could also work, depending on what rules you have for tagging

[13:43:19] <Payam> How do I in regular expression tell that this part of pattern is a must and this part is not
[13:43:43] <ormaaj> I can reverse engineer regex
[13:44:16] <geirha> depends on the regex dialect, but you may want '?'
[13:45:44] <Payam> `hi-blabla_v?[0-9]{1,}.[0-9]{1,}.[0-9]{1,}-[0-9]{1,}-[a-z0-9]{1,}_amd64.deb` and this is not always valid. especially after a tag
[13:46:51] <geirha> what's the goal there?
[13:49:01] <ormaaj> \.deb
[13:49:34] <ormaaj> probably.
[13:50:09] <geirha> if you just want to match all the deb files for that package, a glob like   hi-blabla_*_amd64.deb  should suffice, no?

[18:27:21] <kurahaupo> ioxzev1z: There are two problems. Firstly, calling functions without parentheses is not uncommon, so I guess you haven't had much to do with languages outside the Algol family. Secondly, Shell "functions" are a misnomer; really they're just subroutines.
[18:27:22] <kurahaupo> (Like all commands they have an exit status, but that's really only usable to compose predicates; they can't return composites or strings or fractional numbers or integers outside the 0...255 range, and cannot be combined as algebraic expressions.)

[19:16:48] <wwilliam> &
[19:16:52] <wwilliam> !&
[19:16:53] <greybot> If you put the control operator & at the end of a command, e.g. ''command args &'', the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell. The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0. Pid of the last backgrounded command is available via the special variable $!
[19:16:53] <analoq> the nohup purpose is to keep the code alive after the ssh session ends

[21:42:01] <omegatron> you think too complicated .. just see a command as an array with length 1 or more and construct non-trivial commands as shown above .. gives you the benefit to dump it to the screen easily via echo or printf before/instead you execute it (as a simple "debug" solution) - or just use  declare -p VARIABLE

[22:56:57] <Celmor[m]> how's that tricky? mktemp?
[22:57:24] <geirha> mktemp is not posix
[22:57:26] <Celmor[m]> anyway, thanks for your input
[22:58:21] <Celmor[m]> well, as long as I can install it
[22:58:46] <geirha> ... and it's one of the well-behaving mktemp implementations
[22:58:55] <Celmor[m]> appears to be provided by "coreutils" on my platform
[22:59:26] <geirha> some implementations require an extra option to actually create the file, otherwise just outputting a name that happens to be available at the time mktemp runs
[22:59:49] <greycat> Why do we get so many questions of the form "I have a pipeline in which the writer consumes an extravagant amount of CPU/memory but writes very little; I want it to die instantly when the reader exits, not wait until the next write."

[23:01:06] <geirha> GNU mktemp is one of the sane ones
[23:01:48] <greycat> I don't think it makes named pipes, though.
[23:02:05] <greycat> You could use it to make a directory, and then create the FIFO inside the directory.

[23:50:47] <llua> if you are just trying to loop to 100, you can skip the array and plug the number into the for loop. 100 replacing n
[23:51:29] <greycat> array=( {1..100} )
[23:51:40] <greycat> or if you insist on being silly:  mapfile -t array < <(seq 100)
