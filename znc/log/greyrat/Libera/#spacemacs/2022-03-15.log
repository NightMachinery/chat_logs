[19:46:33] <FromGitter> <pbellini:matrix.org> @dalanicolai: is it possible that the environment context mentioned above is due to spacemacs.env ?

[19:58:48] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @aviaviavi I don't know how things work exactly with PATHs. As far as I understand, Emacs uses the `exec-path` to search for  'available programs/commands' and then it passes the `process-environment`. If something doesn't work, then generally I have/try to debug it/find out why it does not work. So for that `edebug` often is helpful...
[20:01:52] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> @pbellini:matrix.org I forgot how exactly spacemacs.env is used... I guess it is used to set the process-environment.... I am not sure if it is used to set the exec-path
[20:02:54] <FromGitter> <aviaviavi> wow okay I got it working. PATH was indeed getting messed up in emacs, causing it to go to the wrong JAVA. even though My PATH is correct in the shell I was evoking emacs from.

[20:06:57] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Great news! Well I guess somehow it is due to `spacemacs.env` which I think generally does more harm than it does good... I think it would be better if it was optional to use it instead of the default.
