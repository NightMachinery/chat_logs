[05:34:13] <edrx> no
[05:34:38] <s-liao> it requires (require 'eev-template0)
[05:34:40] <edrx> but if you'd like to install the package that it will be easier to use it
[05:34:50] <edrx> let me see...
[05:36:35] <edrx> if you prefer to not install eev then this should be enough:
[05:36:37] <edrx> https://0x0.st/-Fm4.bin
[05:37:35] <edrx> but it you prefer to install eev you can try it by running M-x eev-beginner, then putting the point in a line with this sexp - in any buffer
[05:37:58] <s-liao> Okay
[05:38:09] <edrx> (find-eppp '(:a a :b bb :c "ccc"))
[05:38:46] <edrx> and then you can execute it by typing M-e with the point on the line with that sexp
[05:40:35] <edrx> one of the things that M-x eev-beginner does is that it activates eev-mode, that is a global minor mode that only has a keymap. You can turn eev-mode on an off with M-x eev-mode, and turning it off will disable eev's keys.

[05:41:12] <edrx> yes

[12:52:33] <Pickchea> I've previously used newsticker as my RSS reader and it looks great, usage is also really nice, but it has (at least had) a bunch of bugs so I had to switch.
[12:53:13] <treflip> I use elfeed for RSS, and read Usenet newsgroups through online http frontends, so it would be very nice to have a single interface for all the news I read.

However, I found a stackexchange post about RSS/Atom with Gnus, from where I have (setq gnus-select-method '(nntp "news.gwene.org")) and I just kept rolling with that. Do you think there is any upside to not using Gwene but the nnrss backend instead? Is there anything I can do with that backend but not with Gwene?

[21:24:45] <Guest56> but I work at governement in montreal canada and we have windows
[21:24:49] <bremner> Guest56: I like the idea, but it seems very hard for small projects to keep up with the continual security issues in a browser
[21:24:52] <wasamasa> http://jgkamat.gitlab.io/blog/next-rce.html
[21:25:04] <bremner> also that.
[21:25:06] <wasamasa> mind you, the above thing was an architectural issue
[21:25:26] <wasamasa> they seriously thought they'd be off scotsfree by just deferring all security problems to the underlying browser engine
[21:25:40] <Guest56> bremner I was taling about https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/
[21:25:54] <acdw> next -> nyxt afiak
[21:25:58] <technomancy> building a browser is hard but that nyxt RCE had nothing to do with the fact that building a browser is hard
[21:26:07] <technomancy> they just fucked up spectacularly in a completely unrelated way
[21:26:19] <wasamasa> they thought they're above security issues by using lisp
[21:27:59] <bremner> I guess it turns out not all security issues are buffer overflows?
[21:28:11] <technomancy> yeah, a language which famously allows for full evaluation in the reader. fun.
[21:28:12] <grym> you've just made a bunch of crabs very angry 
[21:28:20] <wasamasa> if you really wanted to, you can have buffer overflows in CL

[22:49:19] <technomancy> twb: flatpak solves the problem where you try to install stuff with a lot of dependencies and they conflict with system-level stuff or whatever. but that's just not the case when you go get a browser from upstream.
[22:49:37] <twb> Yeah because they already embed every library
[22:49:53] <twb> e.g. chrome embeds around 64 python packages

[23:19:44] <wasamasa> so much java software I have to test and everyone laughed at the idea of log injection

[23:23:14] <twb> log4j's output format is also shit
[23:23:15] <wasamasa> the kicker with that story was that the logs got automatically analyzed and the rogue log entry made the software ignore specific log entries
[23:23:19] <codingquark> I'm not sure if my laptop's fans have ramped because it is too cold or if some process is taking a lot of CPU :-P
[23:23:34] <twb> BUT yo ucan log to journal and then --output=json and you can tell a payload newline from a record sep
[23:23:39] <wasamasa> yeah
[23:23:50] <wasamasa> that's the usual recommendation I have for such cases, to use a structured format
[23:23:57] <wasamasa> which you'll want to do anyway
[23:23:59] <codingquark> Interesting
[23:24:06] <twb> really the problem is that log4j users USE FUCKING TEXT FILES
[23:24:25] <twb> if they used journal or relp-to-mariadb even, would not happen
[23:24:44] <wasamasa> structured formats allow you to reliably analyze and aggregate logs

[23:28:35] <aidalgol> twb: Threading only shows you what's said in the thread.  People often make remarks on something that's been talked about elsewhere, and just assume everyone else religiously follows the same news sources as them.

[23:42:36] <bpalmer> I recall reading a nice short story (written, I think, in the 1950s) about how clearly the US was going to have superhighways all over, and rocket powered cars driving them hundreds of miles per hour (bazillions of kilometers per year for those in the metric);  because everybody was crossing the continent, highway patrols would patrol the roads for weeks at a time, sleeping and eating in their vehicles
[23:42:48] <bpalmer> I always thought it was a beautiful extrapolation from then current trends.
[23:46:14] <EdwardIII> bpalmer: you mean car-culture trends?
[23:46:24] <EdwardIII> or that there was a general feeling we'd be breaking down borders?
[23:47:17] <bpalmer> mostly car culture. The interstate system would grow even more to have 10-20 lane highways across the entire country, ever increasing speeds, so on
[23:47:50] <bpalmer> like a lot of 1950sish SF stories, I don't think it paid attention to life outside the US borders.
