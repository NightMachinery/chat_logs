[05:01:20] <jtgd> I want to toggle the visibility of messages starting with "*** ". If I do (add-text-properties (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position) '(invisible t)) it complains that text is read-only. What would be the best approach? Should I remove read-only properties?

[12:42:12] <wasamasa> jtgd: you temporarily make it not read-only
[12:49:39] <wasamasa> though, hm, the usual approach of (let (buffer-read-only) ...) fails
[15:22:30] <jtgd> I don't think the whole buffer is read only because I can type this line at the bottom. I think they make all the text in the buffer except the last line so I'll probably have to remove the read-only property from all the text. 
[15:22:55] <jtgd> I don't think there's any harm in leaving it off, but I could restore it if needed.
[15:23:18] <wasamasa> there's another idiom for that
[15:23:32] <jtgd> oh
[15:23:47] <wasamasa> (with-silent-modifications ...)
[15:24:16] <wasamasa> and that one works
[15:24:19] <jtgd> interesting. I'll look that up. thanks
[15:24:31] <wasamasa> you could look at how fools works
[15:25:57] <jtgd> "fools"?
[15:28:16] <wasamasa> the result of the /fool command
[15:28:51] <wasamasa> like /ignore, but you can toggle between displaying and hiding their lines

[20:30:10] <^alex> there's also "temporarily rebinding `inhibit-read-only'"
