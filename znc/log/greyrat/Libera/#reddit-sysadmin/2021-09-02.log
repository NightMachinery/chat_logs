[00:10:43] <signalblue> can anyone tell me how to make this work?
[00:10:59] <signalblue> libreswan/openswan/strongswan l2tp vpn server
[00:11:08] <signalblue> need to block a domain and an ip
[00:11:48] <signalblue> users can access the domain/ip when not connected but when they are, access to those resources should be blocked
[00:11:58] <iphone> wouldn't you block the IP at the firewall?
[00:12:11] <shibboleth> whay are you using ipsec-over-l2tp and not openvpn/wireguard?
[00:12:14] <shibboleth> why
[00:12:19] <iphone> IPSEC is fine
[00:12:29] <iphone> its a pain, but its fine. Lots of places use it.
[00:12:50] <shibboleth> yeah, but ios, windows and droid native clients don't support pfs
[00:12:53] <iphone> a healthcare data transport company I was looking at required experience with ipsec
[00:13:12] <signalblue> ok
[00:13:18] <signalblue> let me explain
[00:13:26] <signalblue> the firewall doesn't support it
[00:13:35] <signalblue> and the client doesn't support anything but this
[00:14:02] <shibboleth> signalblue, you're presumably doing gateway redirection?
[00:14:15] <iphone> surely you can block that IP with iptables on the vpn host(s)
[00:14:16] <signalblue> yes
[00:14:25] <signalblue> iphone, does not work
[00:14:25] <shibboleth> then block access to said resources in said gateway?
[00:14:46] <signalblue> gateway doesn't support it... router/firewall and gateway is one thing
[00:15:01] <shibboleth> then add a dummy route
[00:15:16] <iphone> I don't see how you add an iptables rule to drop packets matching that IP
[00:15:34] <mistiry> signalblue: push routes for whatever IP's you want to take over, and then blackhole them on your side
[00:15:38] <iphone> s/how you/how you couldn't
[00:15:39] <layer8> iphone meant: "I don't see how you couldn't add an iptables rule to drop packets matching that IP"
[00:16:01] <signalblue> mistiry: how do I do that?
[00:16:08] <PublicWiFi> shit
[00:16:13] <signalblue> sorry for the stupid question
[00:16:18] <PublicWiFi> was it sintax or signalblue that said they use nginx as reverse proxy for exchange?
[00:17:04] <signalblue> I use Nginx for RP but not with Exchange
[00:17:30] <sd> 15<v​ic> So, i'm thinking of restricting our sysadmins from being logged in at their PC with domain admin account. We use name.surname@company.com format. I just remove their rights from name.surname account and create and name.surname_adm account for them to use when needed?
[00:17:37] <mistiry> idk how in *swan
[00:18:02] <signalblue> mistory was that a Windows solution you gave me?
[00:18:09] <signalblue> mistiry I mean
[00:18:18] <mistiry> likely a config somewhere in a format like 'push route 1.1.1.1' in a config file somewhere
[00:18:38] <mistiry> routes that are pushed to clients are configured on the server side
[00:18:38] <signalblue> yeah
[00:18:50] <mistiry> its the routes you want added to the client's route table when a connection is made
[00:19:30] <signalblue> ok I'll see how I can make it work
[00:19:34] <mistiry> you tell it you want to route 1.1.1.1 (example) over the VPN. so now when the client is connected and goes to 1.1.1.1, that traffic will leave over the VPN interface instead of their default internet gateway
[00:20:00] <mistiry> and when they disconnect, that route disappears and they can access it normally again
[00:20:06] <signalblue> the VPN is using the gateway though
[00:20:17] <signalblue> the VPN is behind a NAT gateway
[00:20:33] <signalblue> and is routing internet traffic through that
[00:20:43] <signalblue> VPN server I mean
[00:20:59] <mistiry> i mean, sure, the VPN server has to have a gateway to the internet. but if the clients are using the VPN server as its gateway (for whatever routes you configure) then you can control what happens to that traffic with a rule
[00:21:08] <signalblue> squid doesn't do anything here
[00:21:14] <signalblue> thought it might help
[00:21:42] <signalblue> domains I'm guessing, HOST file on VPN server?
[00:22:08] <mistiry> well, domain would be different
[00:22:32] <signalblue> how would it work?
[00:22:34] <mistiry> VPN clients arent checking the hosts file on the VPN server
[00:22:44] <mistiry> whatever their DNS servers are set for
[00:22:50] <mistiry> or a hosts file to block it
[00:22:55] <signalblue> yeah I can't add the entry on the HOST file of the VPN Client
[00:22:57] <mistiry> or a firewall rule on the firewall in front of the clients
[00:23:25] <signalblue> just have the client point its DNS to a server where domain = 0.0.0.0?
[00:24:00] <mistiry> that's one way. not a great way, but would work.

[00:30:18] <signalblue> because it's the use case of this tunnel
[00:31:47] <mistiry> probably easier not to split-tunnel and only allow the traffic you want
[00:32:01] <mistiry> rather than try to maintain a large list of manually-blocked IPs or domains
[00:32:15] <mistiry> thats not going to scale or be manageable long-term
[00:32:39] <signalblue> it's the whole wide internet minus a handful of IPs
[00:32:47] <signalblue> that's the traffic
[00:33:18] <signalblue> and simply adding leftsubnet=X.X.X.X or rightsubnet=X.X.X.X doesn't work

[03:03:39] <Hunterkll> only time we get pre-imaged machines is when we had a vendor imaging machines for us using an SCCM site server attached to our network, and they also put the asset tags on for us :)

[03:12:49] <Hunterkll> Activ8: and this is why we don't invite you to the r-s orgies
[03:13:01] <rpifan> what do you mean Activ8 ?
[03:13:28] <Activ8> Not interested in orgies I know what you lot get up too lol
[03:13:43] <Hunterkll> Activ8: it's also why you're not on the ch ristmas card list
[03:14:01] <Activ8> I don’t do Christmas either lol
[03:14:09] <rpifan> i have xmas as well
[03:14:11] <rpifan> hate it
[03:14:14] <rpifan> as much as i hate going into an ofice
[03:14:25] <Activ8> rpifan home working is probably due to covid in the job description 
[03:14:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:14:44] <Activ8> I heard German Christmas market is good though
[03:15:16] <rpifan> yea

[03:15:30] <rpifan> i dont care how many dogs or free coffee your office has

[03:16:18] <rpifan> do you never go into an ofice Activ8 ?
[03:16:33] <Activ8> I get up, go make a cuppa switch my phone off DND then jump back into bed till I get a call or ticket alert 
[03:16:41] <Hunterkll> @telgareith because we supply them?
[03:16:45] <Activ8> never not been in for the last 2 years
[03:16:51] <Activ8> all remote work
[03:17:01] <rpifan> Activ8, yes my god
[03:17:04] <rpifan> that would be a dream job
[03:17:06] <rpifan> literally 
[03:17:10] <rpifan> what you described
[03:17:36] <DOMF> I havent been in an office since 2013
[03:17:48] <Hunterkll> 2016 for me
[03:17:53] <DOMF> occasionally I miss it and then I hear office horror stories and don't miss it any more
[03:17:59] <Hunterkll> i go in occasionally (2-3 times a year) to meet and greet or for events
[03:18:01] <Hunterkll> but that's about it
[03:19:27] <rpifan> see thats what i want
[03:19:29] <rpifan> total freedom
[03:19:41] <rpifan> to work and travel
[03:19:56] <rpifan> maybe i dont deserve it and i just need to be sad and depressed for the rest of my life
[03:20:04] <Hunterkll> i've never met my current boss in person 
[03:20:08] <Hunterkll> and he's been my boss for over 3 years
[03:20:08] <Hunterkll> lol
[03:20:15] <saturntho> thats my dream
[03:20:17] <saturntho> i want a full remote job
[03:20:29] <rpifan> a lot of ppl do
[03:20:54] <saturntho> hopefully post pandemic it will be a lot more common
[03:21:16] <Activ8> I personally think all jobs should be remote these days and have the odd meeting get together 
[03:21:27] <rpifan> it sadly wont
[03:21:29] <Activ8> unless you can’t work remotely I.e lorry driver

[03:25:20] <dragonfleas> where do aws health checks come from
[03:25:31] <Activ8> from the doctor
[03:25:34] <dragonfleas> like do they have some god powers over their edge network that are always able to run health checks against web servers
[03:26:07] <Activ8> they must do
[03:26:09] <dragonfleas> because I have a target group on a non-standard HTTP port and straight up, I can curl it get 200 response, right protocol, everything but AWS health check is pepega
[03:26:35] <dragonfleas> even my docker health check is healthy, but target group on the right path, NOPE
[03:26:55] <dragonfleas> i wonder if cloudwatch dumps logs for health checks that are more verbose

[09:16:20] <CoJaBo> barred_owl: Too dang long, apparently
[09:16:26] <CoJaBo> I wrote a data-validation function to handle if an imported record was a corrupted version of a good one; if such a thing is found, it automatically deletes the good one.
[09:16:40] <barred_owl> CoJaBo, I am looking to the dark side--development
[09:16:44] <estranger> ....
[09:16:50] <estranger> deletes the good one?
[09:16:54] <CoJaBo> I helpfully wrote a coverage and validation test to ensure all the data-validation code executes without crashing. The validation test validates that only one record exists after the data-validation function runs.
[09:16:54] <dragonfleas> hahaha
[09:17:05] <barred_owl> CoJaBo, python?
[09:17:07] <dragonfleas> awh yes, let the corrupted files flow through you

[09:20:00] <estranger> well it's a stock bonus

[10:11:39] <csws> last increased in 2009
[10:11:46] <Activ8> oh it goes by state in the US?
[10:11:47] <Activ8> https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/best-states/minimum-wage-by-state
[10:11:57] <undeclared> minimum wage in Canada is over $15 as of yesterday, that I can get behind
[10:12:07] <xe0n> A Queensland school has been closed and fears of a fresh Covid-19 outbreak are mounting as it was revealed a family who returned from a hotspot is refusing to be tested.
[10:12:09] <xe0n> LOL!
[10:12:49] <csws> undeclared, CAD?
[10:12:52] <undeclared> yea
[10:13:06] <csws> lol $11.89 in real money
[10:13:17] <csws> wooow cad has crashed
[10:13:18] <undeclared> yea but better than $7.25
[10:13:27] <csws> I seem to remember it being more
[10:13:36] <undeclared> and you can probably live on that
[10:13:38] <csws> that's federal though
[10:13:52] <undeclared> $2400 before taxes.. not even that much
[10:13:53] <csws> each state, county, city.. whatever.. will have it sown regulations
[10:14:01] <csws> like I think seattle did the $15 minimum wage thing
[10:14:10] <Mark_Pinecone> Minimum wage 500eur p/m taxes included :D
[10:14:28] <csws> last I checked it's roughly $22 AUD/hour for casuals here
[10:14:36] <csws> little less for under 18s
[10:14:42] <undeclared> yea you guys get ripped so bad on hardware
[10:14:47] <undeclared> I remember what a friend told me he paid for a corsair keyboard
[10:14:47] <xe0n> LOL!
[10:14:58] <undeclared> like 300 aud or something.. would be like 150 cad
[10:14:59] <xe0n> talking about wages...oh yeah your pc hardware is overpriced!!
[10:15:00] <xe0n> LOL
[10:15:07] <csws> wat
[10:15:13] <undeclared> err
[10:15:13] <csws> I mean yeah it's overpriced
[10:15:15] <csws> but it isn't THAT overpriced
[10:15:22] <Activ8> we not on about hardware we on about wages
[10:15:23] <undeclared> then they were just exaggeating
[10:15:24] <csws> and prices in canada were pretty retarded when I was there too
[10:15:27] <undeclared> yea
[10:15:35] <csws> second hand server gear especially
[10:15:49] <undeclared> second hand server gear on ebay is crazy cheap.. but try to get it local, forget it
[10:16:01] <xe0n> smh..
[10:16:03] <csws> lol
[10:16:07] <csws> if its' from the US maybe
[10:16:08] <undeclared> in comparison anyway
[10:16:10] <csws> get it over the border and welp
[10:16:11] <Activ8> that's the case here in uk
[10:16:16] <Activ8> can never get stuff local
[10:16:32] <undeclared> oh yeah sucks
[10:16:41] <undeclared> here we also pay more for games, really stupidly.. like $80 CAD for a game
[10:16:41] <csws> look on craigslist or kijiji and it's all filled with retards who want 1000 bux for their PE 2950
[10:16:45] <undeclared> haha
[10:16:47] <Mark_Pinecone> Who use second hand server gear except HomeLab owners?
[10:16:53] <Activ8> there's 1u servers advertised for less than $151.55
[10:16:57] <undeclared> nice
[10:17:01] <Disconsented> Some SMBs will
[10:17:28] <xe0n> anyway...
[10:17:34] <csws> anyway......
[10:17:37] <Activ8> there's nothing wrong with second hand servers as long as ya test them
[10:17:43] <Activ8> if they working they fine
[10:17:52] <csws> ehh
[10:17:59] <csws> depends on how important it is I guess
[10:18:39] <enix> how long you been sitting on that ascii csws 
[10:18:42] <Activ8> servers generally don't fail much in 20 years of me doing IT once has a server completely died without warning

[10:26:58] <enix> i should have RTFM ages ago
[10:27:31] <xe0n> haha
[10:27:46] <Activ8> who told me there isn't a windows 11 LTSC branch coming out? there is
[10:27:52] <Activ8> but in about 3 years time
[10:27:53] <xe0n> me
[10:28:01] <xe0n> have they confirmed it now?
[10:28:05] <Activ8> yes 
[10:28:13] <Cl0udNinja> RTFM? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB6UI79pLEM
[10:28:13] <xe0n> official response from ms last week was "we're not ready to talk about this yet"
[10:28:14] <barred_owl> fuck win11
[10:28:28] <xe0n> cool, got a source?
[10:28:34] <Hunterkll> xe0n: they confirmed it in like, july 
[10:28:38] <Hunterkll> https://www.petri.com/microsoft-confirms-windows-11-will-have-ltsc-branch?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_cIE1Xm7WJUY3vJZ8yRbpJhuiTQHF0eDYtO1DC2fa9Vo-1630562294-0-gqNtZGzNAhCjcnBszQil
[10:28:55] <Activ8> lol
[10:29:00] <Activ8> lots of sauce
[10:29:01] <Hunterkll> i mean
[10:29:08] <Hunterkll> with the caveat of "many things can change before then"
[10:29:15] <xe0n> was more referring to release, but okay cool, not really fussed
[10:29:17] <xe0n> dont use it
[10:29:17] <xe0n> lol
[10:29:24] <Hunterkll> right? don't know why anyone would
[10:29:38] <enix> question is, will Windows 11 work with my Samba AD
[10:29:41] <Hunterkll> given it will also have a 5-year support cycle 
[10:29:46] <Hunterkll> like
[10:29:49] <Hunterkll> it doesn't even buy you much at all
[10:29:51] <Hunterkll> except heartache
[10:29:52] <Activ8> why? because it's stripped down, less resources
[10:29:56] <Hunterkll> LOL
[10:29:59] <xe0n> hehhh
[10:29:59] <Hunterkll> you got jokes
[10:30:04] <Activ8> on the main branch you can't remove some things
[10:30:08] <xe0n> ......
[10:30:11] <xe0n> yeah, you manage em
[10:30:13] <Hunterkll> you'd use LTSC if you're a fucking moron 
[10:30:18] <xe0n> you've only had six years to learn how to manage those things you dont like
[10:30:19] <xe0n> soo thats fine
[10:30:26] <Activ8> in the LTSC branch they all removed, all the shit you don't want out of the box
[10:30:26] <xe0n> you got a few more years to learn by the sounds of it
[10:30:32] <xe0n> okay...
[10:30:33] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:30:43] <Activ8> you don't then have to manage it, it's done for you
[10:30:49] <xe0n> smh..
[10:30:49] <Hunterkll> yea shave off a few hundred mb for some appx's code that's still in there and running anyway
[10:30:52] <Activ8> 😛
[10:30:55] <Hunterkll> then run into a world of hurt in compatiblity issues
[10:30:57] <Hunterkll> and compliance issues
[10:31:01] <xe0n> yeah wowwww no inbox apps...
[10:31:02] <Hunterkll> and managability issues
[10:31:03] <Hunterkll> etc
[10:31:08] <Activ8> I haven't had compatibility issues
[10:31:13] <Hunterkll> congrats
[10:31:17] <Activ8> I run it at home not in business I never said for business
[10:31:19] <Hunterkll> now go work somewhere taht uses real software 
[10:31:23] <xe0n> lets just end this convo...now.
[10:31:26] <Hunterkll> i wouldn't even use it at home
[10:31:26] <enix> no be're we're having compatibility issues Activ8 
[10:31:29] <Hunterkll> because i'm not a fucking idiot 
[10:31:35] <enix> =.=
[10:32:00] <Hunterkll> also, there were periods of time where games i'd want to play wouldn't have worked either :p
[10:32:04] <Activ8> what's it got to do with you what someone else uses? if they wanna use it then so be it, no need to call them an idiot
[10:32:12] <Hunterkll> or other apps i use (photoshop & autocad specifically)
[10:32:15] <Hunterkll> i mean
[10:32:22] <Hunterkll> i'm only calling 'em what they are
[10:32:28] <xe0n> [2021.09.02.15:59:53] <Activ8> why? because it's stripped down, less resources
[10:32:32] <xe0n> less resources
[10:32:34] <xe0n> suurrrreeee
[10:32:37] <Hunterkll> right?
[10:32:37] <xe0n> anyway...
[10:32:37] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:32:48] <csws> enix, why wouldn't it work with samba AD? I remember in TAFE we joined an XP machine to a samba domain
[10:32:55] <xe0n> LOL
[10:33:10] <csws> it was alpha back then lol
[10:33:29] <Activ8> ha ha
[10:33:36] <enix> csws: I can't imagine it not working, Samba AD was so well built that they dont have to go through as many updates as microsoft does
[10:33:39] <csws> had to do all sorts of hacks to even get it to install as the maintainer's script was screwed
[10:33:48] <enix> *cough*
[10:33:49] <xe0n> hahaha
[10:33:55] <xe0n> AD hasn't been updated in forever :P
[10:34:05] <enix> *cough*
[10:34:13] <TheJollyRoger> Hunterkll: Heh. I see you guys have been exposed to those self-defeating privacy enthusiasts that run LTSC on their home PCs, haha. 
[10:34:17] <Hunterkll> Server 2016 is still the highest DFL/FFL 
[10:34:20] <csws> I know a guy who actually runs a samba AD
[10:34:31] <xe0n> yeah same, enix
[10:34:32] <xe0n> :D
[10:34:35] <Hunterkll> TheJollyRoger: i don't think its' a privacy thing, but LTSC reports the same telemetry as SAC so ......
[10:34:36] <TheJollyRoger> They sure know how to leave a bad taste in the mouth!
[10:34:36] <enix> Yeah same, xe0n 
[10:34:36] <csws> didn't find out until he was asking me about some powershell stuff, trying to find dead accounts
[10:34:41] <Activ8> https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setting_up_Samba_as_an_Active_Directory_Domain_Controller
[10:34:45] <xe0n> :D
[10:34:46] <TheJollyRoger> Hunterkll: Oh, yeah, it's a meme.
[10:34:47] <csws> I gave him a query that should've worked and it kept erroring out on his shitty samba domain lol
[10:35:00] <TheJollyRoger> But it seems that memes just don't know when to die.
[10:35:02] <xe0n> Activ8: plz dont..
[10:35:03] <xe0n> lol
[10:35:08] <enix> Probably my predeccessor 
[10:35:09] <Hunterkll> running LTSC for anything you use as a daily driver machine is as stupid as using samba AD in a work environment
[10:35:09] <Hunterkll> :D
[10:35:16] <TheJollyRoger> Bwahahaha
[10:35:38] <TheJollyRoger> I *could* see a purpose to LTSC... for things like industrial controllers or Ultrasound machines. But that's a special case.
[10:35:44] <Hunterkll> well, yes
[10:35:49] <Hunterkll> it's the drop in "replacement" for windows embedded
[10:35:50] <Activ8> well that's what it's built for TheJollyRoger
[10:35:53] <enix> I run LTSC just so I don thave to update so often
[10:35:55] <xe0n> thats the exact purpose for it!
[10:35:56] <xe0n> LOL
[10:36:00] <enix> It's so annoying. I just want to watch porn and windows has to update
[10:36:00] <TheJollyRoger> Hahahaha, oh makes sense.
[10:36:03] <Hunterkll> 8.1 industry pro / 8 industry / 7 embedded 
[10:36:07] <enix> ragers already raged out by the time it reboots
[10:36:08] <Hunterkll> were all just slightly tweaked versions of the full shit 
[10:36:09] <Activ8> I don't pay for the license it's a tad expensive but I'm not paying
[10:36:20] <xe0n> pirate!!!
[10:36:21] <Hunterkll> with some extra filter drivers and settings or whatever 
[10:36:25] <xe0n> im reporting you to the pirate police!!
[10:36:27] <Hunterkll> embedded adds shit to the base OS usually 
[10:36:28] <Hunterkll> lol
[10:36:31] <Activ8> no it's under a business license
[10:36:39] <xe0n> BUT ITS NOT YOUR LICENSE

[10:36:49] <csws> if the BSA finds my totally legit KMS server I'm dooooomed :(
[10:36:53] <Activ8> I have a legit key  from work, under WFH I can use it
[10:37:03] <TheJollyRoger> Hahaha, and not the kind of pirate I like to play as :P.
[10:37:38] <Activ8> but anyway..
[10:37:48] <enix> Activ8: you're a thieving pirate

[10:38:08] <Hunterkll> for work machine, sure
[10:38:09] <Activ8> it's a company machine 😛
[10:38:16] <xe0n> ........
[10:38:17] <Hunterkll> well that's even worse
[10:38:22] <Hunterkll> because you legit said you wouldn't use it at business
[10:38:23] <Hunterkll> xD

[10:58:36] <Cl0udNinja> that was definitely early elementary school when I saw one
[10:58:40] <Hunterkll> just used the MO disc drive as boot/root volume
[10:58:49] <Hunterkll> that was originally released in 1989 iirc 
[10:58:55] <Activ8> anyone ever had a flick through the argos catalog edition 1?

[22:02:28] <PublicWiFi> hmm
[22:02:57] <PublicWiFi> so my reverse proxy is working, but if a subdomain is pointing to my shit and you try to access that subdomain via https... the 404 works
[22:03:03] <PublicWiFi> BUT youll get a cert popup cause there's no cert
[22:03:18] <PublicWiFi> am I gonna have to get a wildcard just to "professionally" redirect bad requests to a 404 lol
[22:03:23] <PublicWiFi> wildcard cert*
[22:03:57] <PublicWiFi> like all non-approved subdomains will route to a 404 but it doesn't have a valid cert on those lol
[22:04:32] <PublicWiFi> since the SSL handshake happens first you can't stop it 
[22:04:35] <iphone> Wildcard, or get one with a list of subdomains set as Subject-Alternative Names
[22:04:55] <PublicWiFi> wildcard seems the easist to pipe any non-approved requests to
[22:05:04] <PublicWiFi> since the proxy will forward any matching subdomains on
