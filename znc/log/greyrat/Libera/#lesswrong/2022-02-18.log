[00:00:12] <galambo> what do you guys think of this criticism of game of thrones? https://web.archive.org/web/20150218051251/http://partialobjects.com/2013/08/game-of-thrones-this-is-an-intervention-now-part-iii/

[00:00:30] <quanticle> The TV show or the books?
[00:00:44] <quanticle> Er, is that criticism about the TV show or the books?
[00:00:45] <galambo> quanticle, the article applies to both
[00:03:04] <quanticle> Oh, I see what the article is saying. It's saying that Game of Thrones is a "white mythic space"
[00:04:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> a hwat
[00:04:30] <Betawolf> so, what, black people aren't allowed to read it?
[00:06:15] <Betawolf> 'the missing history of the Middle Ages' the what?
[00:06:17] <galambo> Betawolf, basically the author is saying people like game of thrones because its a cooler version of the middle ages. if the middle ages were good game of thrones would have been a non-sequitur
[00:06:39] <Obormot\Arcturus> Uh
[00:06:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> I think it might be possible that people like Game of Thrones because it has MAGIC and DRAGONS

[00:07:17] <galambo> so game of thrones to white people is black panther to black people

[00:08:14] <galambo> as an egyptian I feel smug saying this. I will bring this up the next time a british person tells me they have an intersting history.
[00:09:16] <galambo> egyptians dont fake their history
[00:09:29] <Betawolf> this person seems to be confused into thinking there is no history of the middle ages, but they say so many other wrong things it's like whatever
[00:09:32] <quanticle> Bro, I hate to break it to you, but British history is in fact far more interesting than Egyptian history. Egyptian history is 4000 years of domesticating cats, followed by getting conquered by a bunch of half-baked Italians wearing silly hats, followed by getting overrun by some hicks from Saudi
[00:10:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> British history is pretty interesting yeah
[00:10:33] <galambo> quanticle, maybe but we werent so ashamed of our history we made a fake version of it
[00:10:34] <quanticle> Betawolf: Yeah, I stopped reading it too. I'm not even sure what argument they're trying to make, and their facts are basically wrong about the Middle Ages so w/e
[00:11:37] <Betawolf> galambo: are there no egyptian fantasy epics?
[00:11:50] <quanticle> No, because Islam hates history
[00:12:11] <Betawolf> I mean, there are definitely ones that use egyptian mythology tropes, but they're all British/American authors.

[00:17:25] <gwern> you could fit all recorded british history (at least post-roman) into one of those gaps in egyptian histories where they go 'a dynasty or two arose and fell, anyway, our next pharaoh of interest is Pharaoh Hottentop'
[00:18:17] <galambo> gwern, I had to memorise so many dates when I was in school
[00:18:21] <Betawolf> The issue is Egypt was so marvellously conservative that while lots of time was going on not a lot was happening.
[00:18:46] <Betawolf> (until Alexander, at least)
[00:19:01] <gwern> yes, it's interesting precisely because so little could happen for so long. a demonstration that progress is not remotely inevitable

[00:23:40] <saturn2> oh so their history is just as "fake" then
[00:24:15] <Betawolf> IIRC there was a point where the country was fully taken over by a new religion for a dynasty or so and then they got over it and just went back to the old religion for another millenia. RETVRN indeed.

[00:36:51] <otoburb> galambo: Are you still in Egypt? 
[00:36:58] <galambo> no
[00:37:07] <galambo> I live in the uk
[00:37:30] <otoburb> Was it true that the upper class starting switching to learn German instead of French? I heard this from one person but thought it was odd. 
[00:37:52] <galambo> otoburb, do you mean in egypt or in general?
[00:37:55] <otoburb> In EGypt
[00:39:03] <galambo> otoburb, I dont know
[00:40:01] <galambo> I thought people mainly learned french in catholic schools and things like that
[00:40:45] <galambo> upper class probably go to 'american school'
[00:41:00] <otoburb> Right, that's what I thought too -- hence why the comment about wealthy Egyptian families turning to German instead over the past 10 years sounded odd to me. 
[00:41:57] <otoburb> Yeah -- I meant perhaps as third language (notwithstanding MSA vs. Egyptian arabic)
[00:41:59] * gwern didn't realize either french or german were still much taught and not english. after all, you can talk to a lot of the better type of french and germans in english...

[00:43:42] <galambo> otoburb, in high school I did IGCSE which is international british high school
[00:44:01] <otoburb> I went to an international british school was I was a kid in Riyadh. So I feel you. 
[00:44:24] <galambo> ah are you from saudi or were you an expat?
[00:44:49] <otoburb> Expat
[00:44:59] <galambo> how did you find saudi?
[00:45:11] <otoburb> I didn't know it was anything different until I came back to North America
[00:45:35] <otoburb> I felt it was a pretty normal childhood (minus evacuating at the tail end of the Gulf War)
[00:47:05] <galambo> that must have been a frightening experience
[00:48:00] <otoburb> It was. Reading about WWII air raid sirens and hiding under desks is one thing; actually hearing the sirens over the mosque loud speakers and then taking cover -- quite visceral.
[00:48:51] <galambo> have you thought about visiting saudi as an adult
[00:49:15] <otoburb> I could only do that quite recently due to the (very new) tourist class visa. Before then, I didn't really have an opportunity to visit for business.

[00:50:52] <galambo> do you keep in touch with anyone from saudi nowadays?
[00:51:39] <otoburb> Yeah, but they were all expats. I lost touch with my actual Saudi acquaintances. 
[00:52:56] <otoburb> Do you go back to Egypt at all? I've been to Cairo a lot, but never got a chance to visit Iksandria
[00:53:37] <galambo> otoburb, I havent since I came to the UK
[00:54:04] <galambo> I do remember we had someone in high school from a german school and we thought this was all fancy
[00:54:25] <galambo> I dont know if we thought it was fancy because he spoke german or because it was a german school though
[00:54:42] <otoburb> Was he himself German, or Egyptian?

[01:01:17] <quanticle> He's like my brother. He'll sit down and *listen* to music
[01:01:30] <quanticle> It's not like me, where music is just something pleasant to drown out background noise
[01:01:59] <quanticle> Unfortunately for him, digital distribution is far more favorable for people like me than it is for people like him.
[01:03:04] <galambo> quanticle, yes but vinyl is objectively worse than digital in almost every conceivable way

[01:03:42] <quanticle> Depends on what you mean by "digital". CD, sure. But it's probably not worse than whatever shitty 128kbps stream that you get from Spotify on a bad connection.
[01:04:41] <galambo> yes but listening to 320kpbs is trivially easy. much easier than vinyl thats for sure
[01:04:56] <quanticle> But going back to the point I was making above, all the "audiophile" focused streaming service (lol, Tidal) have been utter failures
[01:05:25] <quanticle> Okay, let me ask you this: do you also only read exclusively ebooks?
[01:05:40] <galambo> yes
[01:05:55] <quanticle> Yeah, I don't. ebooks are an inferior experience
[01:05:57] <galambo> I just go to libgen on my eink phone and voila
[01:06:12] <quanticle> Yeah, and that explains why you think Ted Gioia is stupid
[01:06:21] <galambo> yes ebooks are inferior experience than physical books
[01:06:36] <galambo> but the convenience is worth it
[01:06:39] <galambo> on the other hand
[01:07:02] <galambo> digital is better experience than vinyl AND more convenient
[01:07:14] <quanticle> Did you even read the essay? 
[01:07:26] <quanticle> He outlines why digital is not a better experience for him
[01:07:35] <quanticle> Or rather streaming is not a better experience
[01:07:40] <quanticle> He likes reading liner notes
[01:07:50] <quanticle> He likes knowing more about the music that he's listening to
[01:08:01] <quanticle> And streaming doesn't have that
[01:08:15] <galambo> thats a motte and bailey
[01:08:42] <quanticle> Quoting the article... is a motte-and-bailey?
[01:08:55] <galambo> (I am happy to take this to lw-overflow if its overcrowding the chat)
[01:09:09] <galambo> yes streaming =/= digital
[01:09:34] <galambo> cd has all the advantages of vinyl that the author is looking for
[01:09:46] <quanticle> Sure, but his point is that streaming killed CDs
[01:10:04] <Betawolf> you can even throw CDs at people, or snap them in disgust.
[01:10:27] <quanticle> I tried to snap a CD once and I cut myself on the plastic shards
[01:10:29] <quanticle> Never again
[01:11:06] <galambo> cds are still more available/popular than vinyl. if you can find it in vinyl you can find it in cd.
[01:12:10] <spxtr> "When I stream an album of contemporary classical music, I often struggle to learn the name of the composer." that's pretty frustrating on a lot of streaming platforms. they're very bad at classical
[01:12:18] <Betawolf> gramaphones are pretty cool but they're more about having one than convenient high-quality music
[01:13:02] <saturn2> he clearly states that he prefers the "warmth" of vinyl
[01:13:03] <galambo> spxtr, yes I agree. but with some limited research if you are looking for a certain composer making a certain piece of music you can trivially find it
[01:13:05] <quanticle> Yeah, the entire notion that the music might be composed by one person and played by another escapes a lot of streaming platforms.
[01:13:59] <saturn2> and yeah, streaming platforms are a hellish algorithmic wasteland
[01:14:00] <galambo> the opposite is indeed true. if you listen to a random stream you may struggle to identify the composer and the person who played it
[01:14:03] <quanticle> Well, sort of. Searching by *composer* is pretty easy. But it's difficult to search by composer *and* musicican. 
[01:14:13] <galambo> yes thats what I meant
[01:14:18] <spxtr> I miss what.cd :(
[01:14:21] <galambo> no you can actually
[01:14:21] <quanticle> Same
[01:14:34] <galambo> just search the keywords composer musician piece of music
[01:15:28] <galambo> so the main argument against digital is that the cataloguing of a single genre of music is not always complete?
[01:15:49] <quanticle> Well, the metadata sucks and the audio quality is bad
[01:16:00] <spxtr> no, the main argument is that the streaming platforms don't actually care all that much about the music
[01:16:09] <quanticle> It's just "content"
[01:16:15] <galambo> for the record I dont use a streaming platform
[01:16:28] <quanticle> Spotify doesn't actually want you to listen to music on its platform; they'd rather you listen to Joe Rogan
[01:16:35] <spxtr> I use spotify pretty often. it's pretty convenient for a lot of things.
[01:16:40] <spxtr> it's very bad for others, though.
[01:16:49] <galambo> I have 24000 tracks of music on my hard drive or 77 days of music
[01:16:54] <quanticle> Yeah, I was just speaking to Spotify's cost structure
[01:17:08] <quanticle> They pay for every music track, but podcasts are a fixed cost
[01:17:10] <galambo> I can play any track from my collection instantly
[01:17:36] <galambo> the sound quality is only limited by the quality of the recording/mastering and compression
[01:17:46] <galambo> not by the technical capabilities of the file format
[01:18:02] <galambo> the quality will not get degraded or damaged over time
[01:18:25] <galambo> I can store all these music files on a microsd card the size of my nail
[01:19:39] <galambo> I have tools that automatically tag music files by comparing the file with a database
[01:19:54] <spxtr> what do you do if you want to listen to something that you don't already have?
[01:20:01] <galambo> I have another tool that checks the quality of sound files and highlights files with poor quality
[01:20:16] <galambo> spxtr, I just download it?
[01:20:35] <spxtr> sounds pretty inconvenient
[01:20:51] <quanticle> Well, it's less inconvenient than buying a vinyl record
[01:20:56] <galambo> you can download 320kpbs music files from deezer using an app
[01:21:04] <galambo> I can do it in seconds
[01:21:18] <galambo> if its not on deezer I can use something like soulseek
[01:21:37] <galambo> if not then I can resort to youtube
[01:21:51] <quanticle> YouTube's audio quality is trash, though
[01:22:08] <galambo> quanticle, yes which is why its a last ditch option
[01:22:24] <galambo> now vinyl is definitely inferior to digital
[01:22:25] <quanticle> It's hilarious to me to see people uploading "4k" versions of music, and then you use yt-dlp to look at the available audio streams and it maxes out at like 128kbps aac
[01:22:44] <spxtr> 4k music haha
[01:22:47] <galambo> vinyl has a ceiling on quality. and it degrades each time you listen to it
[01:23:09] <spxtr> true vinyl fans consider that a plus
[01:23:24] <galambo> quanticle, technically I think youtube does have high bitrate audio. but you have to use a tool like youtube-dl to extract it. if you use a random tool off the internet it will be crap
[01:23:47] <quanticle> You mean yt-dlp
[01:23:54] <galambo> yes ;)

[01:26:39] <adiabatic> I've been listening to one vinyl fan and while he concedes all the arguments regarding quality, he's figured out that he really likes the tea-ceremony aspects of digging through his collection, taking it out, putting it on the turntable, and playing it, start to finish
[01:27:02] <adiabatic> you can't quite get that from AirPlay from your iOS gizmo to your speakers
[01:27:19] <galambo> adiabatic, ok heres another advantage of vinyl none of you guys brought up
[01:27:40] <galambo> modern music has loudness compression
[01:27:59] <galambo> the difference in volume between loud and quiet parts of a track is small
[01:28:08] <adiabatic> Oh, you like pre-loudness-war music?
[01:28:14] <galambo> yes
[01:28:21] <galambo> and vinyl is less likely to be remastered
[01:29:20] <adiabatic> This is a problem for my copies of Mars, the Bringer of War and Carmina Burana — O Fortuna. You have to crank it up to hear the soft parts and then crank it way down so you don't get your ears blasted

[01:29:45] <adiabatic> I wonder if Apple is trying to fix any of that with all their new shit.
[01:30:07] <galambo> adiabatic, you need a better audio system. and you will afford a good audio system if you stop buying all these overpriced vinyl tracks
[01:30:58] <adiabatic> my good-enough computer speakers are from 1997 and I strongly prefer FLAC+ALAC downloads or CDs I can rip myself
[01:31:08] <adiabatic> I have zero interest in vinyl personally
[01:31:29] <galambo> ok thats fair enough
[01:31:46] <galambo> adiabatic, you did describe a problem similar to this: https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/03/tenet-dialogue-christopher-nolan-sound-technology
[01:31:47] <Robomot> Hard to pardon: why Tenet's muffled dialogue is a very modern problem | Tenet | The Guardian (Christopher Nolan’s latest blockbuster is already infamous for its barely audible exchanges. As sound technology advances, why are films getting harder to hear?)
[01:32:31] <galambo> (people were struggling to hear dialogue in the movie tenet because the speakers were not high quality enough'
[01:36:01] <galambo> ok the article doesnt actually say that but I remember reading it somewhere
[01:40:32] <saturn2> compression isn't automatically bad
[01:41:21] <saturn2> but it should be adjustable
[01:42:03] <spxtr> adjustable as in vbr?
[01:42:26] <spxtr> or adjustable as in having an audio quality selector on youtube
[01:42:30] <saturn2> no, loudness compression not data compression
[01:43:05] <saturn2> amplifying the quieter parts more than the louder parts
[01:43:49] <galambo> in visual terms its like hdr vs sdr and hd vs sd
[01:45:44] <saturn2> the fact that no devices ever have a compression knob along with a volume knob is yet another indictment of humanity
[01:46:12] <galambo> saturn2, there is an option for 'loudness equalization' in windows audio settings
[01:46:13] <saturn2> the technology has existed for a century now
[01:48:37] <saturn2> yes, computer software sometimes has it available as an obscure setting, but it should be as easy to adjust as volume
[01:48:54] <galambo> adiabatic, ok I think I may have been too hasty in my judgment, and I apologise
[01:49:13] <saturn2> actually it should be easier than volume
[01:49:39] <galambo> I do face issues with tracks being too loud or too quiet. I try to mitigate it with 'track gain' but it doesnt always work well

[06:30:15] <gwern> oh sure it can handle very simple tasks, we already saw those gpt-3 demos. but 'proficient'? that implies they trained on it, even if there just wasn't nearly as much as python
[06:31:29] <ggreer> I'm sure they branched out since the august paper, but even they admit it's much better at python than most other languages
[06:31:58] <gwern> but that could just be that python is the most popular language after filtering
[06:32:39] <gwern> there's probably a lot of junk JS to filter out. not so much python
[06:35:04] <PapuaHardyNet> I wonder how much of meta-learning is caused by the dynamic nature of self-attention
[06:35:50] <PapuaHardyNet> nah, that's a very dumb question. MLPs are statically parameterized and they can model any possible function, including ones that have dynamic parameterization
[06:36:08] <PapuaHardyNet> scale up MLPs enough and it is equivalent to self-attention
[06:36:47] <PapuaHardyNet> (although we don't have empirical evidence for this - and having that would be good)
[06:37:40] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm getting more and more convinced that the highest impact thing I could do given my current skill and knowledge and what I have done is to train a byte encoded MLP based large language model and evaluate it in comparison to GPT2 /  GPT3 (small, med, large)
[06:38:10] <PapuaHardyNet> (the code is almost ready, the compute is available on permission, the dataset is also available)
[06:39:58] <gwern> meta-learnng needs some sort of mutable inner loop which can be trained by an outer loop. in RNNs, it's the hidden state is gradually sculpted by the SGD outer loop. in transformers, the 'hidden state' is the self-attention activations. in MAML, it's the second-order gradient descent shaping the parameters to update after a first-order gradient descent step. in more exotic networks like...
[06:40:04] <gwern> ...hopfield or biological neurons, it's the dynamic energy / population spiking patterns. in a MLP it's... ???
[06:41:18] <ggreer> detecting auto-generated js is probably easier than detecting auto-generated python. is it all on one line? it's auto-generated. does it end in .min.js? auto-generated. etc
[06:41:37] <gwern> can the MLP layer activations become complex or powerful enough to demonstrate meta-learning? I can't say they do or don't and I think demonstrating within-episode behavior changes with pure MLPs and thus meta-learning, would be interesting
[06:41:42] <ggreer> though python is the most popular language on github and a ton of ML stuff is python, so I can see why they'd optimize it for that
[06:42:31] <gwern> at least from the pure bayesian point ofview, there's no reason you couldn't create a MLP agent which, say, is conditioned on the full history by having a very big input which is padded, and that *should* meta-learn
[06:43:09] <gwern> the meta-learning there is just a very complex wiggly high-dimensional function from the partially-observed history to an optimal action
[06:44:01] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting.
[06:44:03] <gwern> if you failed to make a MLP meta-learn, that would be a promising direction to tackle
[06:47:12] <gwern> that is, from the bayesian point of view, meta-learning is just inferring a latent variable (figuring out which MDP you are in inside the POMDP) and acting optimally. there's no voodoo about 'self-attention' or 'recurrency'. there is a universe of possible MDPs, which you have a prior over, which generate your observations with a certain likelihood, which you update your prior to a posterior...
[06:47:18] <gwern> ...using, and you act optimally given the remaining uncertainty

[06:48:17] <gwern> at no point do you inherently need 'memory' or 'multiplicative attention' or 'recurrency' or 'attention' or 'dynamic weights' to solve this inferential problem. maybe they are a practical way to compute it, but they are not in the definition of the problem or solution anywhere
[06:48:50] <PapuaHardyNet> sounds good. I guess I'll make that my priority. You think I should drop the byte encoding and use BPE to make comparison easier? I think tokenization is orthogonal to meta-learning but just verifying
[06:49:40] <PapuaHardyNet> specifically, I mean the GPT-NeoX 20B BPE encoding trained on their Pile (because I will be using Pile for training anyway)

[07:55:37] <gwern> computing used to turn over every 5-10 years in completely new platforms, killing everything old which was not hugely lucrative or critical enough. nowadays, everything is so static that you can just plop down a linux box running LAMP, build an online game, and run it for 20 years with minor upgrades and sysadminning. it's not like going from an 8-bit QDOS dialup to 64-bit Mac OS X datacenter...

[10:14:48] <quanticle> BMRs?
[10:14:54] <capisce> basal metabolic rate
[10:15:21] <quanticle> Maybe it's just because rice farming is hard manual labor
[10:15:31] <quanticle> And they're just basically constantly working out
[10:15:53] <capisce> so it seems whether eating a high carb diet pumps or slows your metabolism depends on how much PUFA is in your body fat
[10:16:07] <quanticle> Oh god, not your PUFA theory again
[10:16:07] <capisce> if there's a high enough amount of PUFA, that wrecks the metabolism
[10:16:19] <capisce> that's exactly what all this stuff shows though
[10:16:45] <capisce> high carb eating office workers in South Korea, China etc also had very high metabolisms
[10:17:10] <quanticle> If that's the case, then why is obesity spiking so high in India and China?
[10:17:21] <capisce> the body converts carbs to saturated fats
[10:17:37] <capisce> because they're now eating increasingly more PUFAs
[10:18:12] <quanticle> So basically retvrn to butter
[10:18:24] <quanticle> You know, I could get behind this approach
[10:18:48] <capisce> yes, but getting rid of the PUFAs stored up in one's adipose tissue seems to be a very long and slow process
[10:19:03] <quanticle> Just exercise more
[10:19:06] <capisce> and the metabolic issues will sabotage you along the way

[10:23:48] <capisce> "He cites a study from the Netherlands where people who had never exercised before were trained to run a marathon over a period of a year.  By the end they were running 25 miles per week.  Pontzer says this amount of running plus the additional muscle mass should have increased daily burn by 390 calories, but in fact it only increased burn by 120 calories."
[10:23:57] <quanticle> Like, you're legit telling me that I'm burning the same amount of calories in January, when I'm sitting on my ass for weeks at a time as I am in July, when I'm running like 4-6 miles a day? Yeah, come on.
[10:24:11] <feep[work]> july is warmer too, not sure how that affects things
[10:24:24] <capisce> surely there's some difference, but not something a tiny addition in caloric input will eliminate
[10:24:29] <capisce> so if it leads to more hunger it's a wash
[10:24:40] <quanticle> Only if you actually eat more
[10:24:44] <capisce> maybe it's also connected to the daylight and sun exposure in summer
[10:24:46] <quanticle> Hunger != eating more!
[10:24:59] <quanticle> Holy shit, this is what I get frustrated with people. It's okay to be hungry!
[10:24:59] <adiabatic> capisce: I'm doing the croissant diet, AMA
[10:25:29] <quanticle> I'm definitely more hungry in the summer than I am in the winter, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm eating more
[10:25:34] <capisce> for some people it seems very hard to resist eating while being hungry and stressed
[10:26:00] <feep[work]> I do not attempt this at all
[10:26:14] <capisce> adiabatic: how's it working for you?
[10:26:43] <capisce> eating high carb seems a bit risky, unless your metabolism is already in a good shape
[10:26:59] <adiabatic> capisce: it only started working _maybe_ after I got the succinade and the sterculia oil and found out a way to eat loads of cocoa butter (mix it 50:50 by weight with 72% chocolate)
[10:27:13] <adiabatic> also I started doing yoga or something more or less physically intensive daily
[10:27:19] <quanticle> I guess. I was at the running track the other day (which goes around an indoor soccer field), and I was listening to this soccer mom complaining about how she just couldn't lose weight. She was a bit heavy; not fat, but she could stand to lose some weight. And she was talking to her friend about her diet and I was thinking, "Holy shit, lady, you've eaten more before lunch than I do all day"
[10:27:31] <capisce> adiabatic: right, seems it's not so straightforward
[10:27:33] <quanticle> None of it was "bad" food as such
[10:27:36] <feep[work]> quanticle: right, but isn't that odd?
[10:27:45] <quanticle> No chips, candy. She was eating nuts and fruit and whatever, but my god
[10:27:45] <feep[work]> she has eaten more before lunch than you do all day and she's only a bit heavy?
[10:27:52] <adiabatic> feep[work]: no, I can stay fat by eating just healthy foods once a day
[10:28:17] <quanticle> feep[work]: Well, she was exercising
[10:28:21] <quanticle> So I figured that was it
[10:28:21] <feep[work]> ah fair
[10:28:31] <feep[work]> adiabatic: well the big problem with CICO I guess is that the body can adjust its CO independent of your input.
[10:28:32] <capisce> nuts are also quite heavy in pufa, I guess in the ancestral environment they weren't so readily available without expending any effort
[10:28:34] <quanticle> Like, her exercise was barely keeping up with what she was eating, but my god
[10:28:51] <capisce> also, animals eat a lot of nuts before winter hibernation to gain fat and lower their metabolism
[10:29:04] <quanticle> Like, don't eat, and you'll lose weight. Diets insofar as they work, work by tricking you into eating less by taking away the foods you want to eat
[10:29:15] <capisce> likely eating the nuts will just make her more hungry
[10:29:18] <adiabatic> capisce: also my body temps have been jiggling around the same range and only going out of whack (always down) if I don't sleep
[10:29:36] <adiabatic> also nuts are super calorie dense and she'll be able to snarf down 500 calories of them without blinking
[10:29:44] <capisce> yep, lack of sleep causes me to gain weight easily too it seems
[10:30:02] <quanticle> Eh, I don't know about nuts making you more hungry. A lot of people say that carb-ish foods make them hungry and nuts reduce their hunger disproportionately
[10:30:09] <feep[work]> can confirm, sleep too little, got weight gained
[10:30:17] <quanticle> Sleep too little destroys willpower
[10:30:20] <feep[work]> though it's reached fair stability at its current high point
[10:30:45] <feep[work]> when I started working here I made an executive decision to not even worry about weight gain, and so far it seeems to be working out
[10:30:48] <capisce> carb-ish foods might make them hungry by increasing their metabolism, if they're already metabolically healthy
[10:30:58] <capisce> see, that's the thing, what works for a thin person won't work for a fat person
[10:30:59] <feep[work]> I'm like 20kg over optimal, but it basically hasn't budged in a year
[10:31:10] <adiabatic> 20 kg is a lot of weight, dude
[10:31:12] <feep[work]> yep
[10:31:12] <quanticle> ^
[10:31:19] <feep[work]> the point is it's stable where it is
[10:31:21] <nshepperd2> the other problem with CICO is your body can force you to increase CI by making you lethargic and miserable otherwise
[10:31:30] <adiabatic> ^
[10:31:33] <feep[work]> nshepperd2: yeah that's why I'm not even trying.
[10:31:56] <capisce> yeah, for me losing weight is a struggle, but still I try to persist
[10:32:04] <feep[work]> like... there's a point where I switched from bike riding to riding a scooter to work
[10:32:14] <feep[work]> this has, as far as I can tell, genuinely not made any difference to my weight!
[10:32:16] <capisce> I had the best success when I went off to South East Asia and didn't have any work or stress
[10:32:34] * quanticle has been at his current weight since like just around the start of college
[10:32:35] <feep[work]> so that supports the evidence that exercise doesn't matter much
[10:32:38] <capisce> even though I was eating rice several times every day
[10:32:50] <quanticle> That's when I got into running
[10:33:06] <quanticle> Mainly because I needed something to do while my brother was at swimming lessons
[10:33:09] <capisce> but even then I had to deal with hunger and low energy
[10:33:12] <adiabatic> one of my problems is that if I want to lose weight through calorie restriction, I can, without too much difficulty, undereat so much that my is-fasting routine starts up and I wake up Too Damn Early because my body is hungry and ready to go
[10:33:31] <adiabatic> quanticle: and swimming never occurred to you…?
[10:33:38] <adiabatic> or was the pool just taken
[10:33:40] <capisce> yeah, fasting also negatively impacts my sleep
[10:33:45] <quanticle> adibatic: No, because the entire pool is used up for swimming lessons!
[10:33:52] <capisce> although I did a couple of five day fasts while in Thailand
[10:33:59] <quanticle> No room with a bunch of 6 year olds splashing around
[10:34:46] <quanticle> Also I hate the smell of chlorine
[10:34:57] <quanticle> And if you swim regularly it like builds up
[10:35:09] <capisce> maybe I should get a treadmill, since the roads are icy here for several months each winter
[10:35:17] <quanticle> Until you smell of the pool in the same way that a heavy smoker smells of tobacco
[10:35:28] <saturn2> "is the problem pufas or omega-6" both wrong, actually it's sneed oils
[10:35:39] <capisce> though ideally I should get a bigger apartment first
[10:36:03] <quanticle> You might look for indoor running tracks
[10:36:07] <quanticle> That's what I do
[10:36:09] <adiabatic> I got a good workout from my watch+iPhone with apple fitness+ on one of the exercise bikes at my gym
[10:36:15] <quanticle> Running on treadmills is more boring than lifting weights
[10:36:27] <capisce> guess so
[10:36:38] <adiabatic> but you can turn on a podcast

[12:35:21] <nshepperd> it should parse that as a block and report that the whole word doesn't match
[12:35:30] <nshepperd> very silly parser
[12:35:35] <feep[work]> probably a perf optimization
[12:35:56] <feep[work]> you can have five unlikely branches
[12:36:08] <nshepperd> i doubt that
[12:36:19] <feep[work]> as opposed to five fairly plausible branches to check for "not a character"
[12:36:45] <feep[work]> nshepperd: what I'm saying is, I expect even a fast json *lexer* to parse this wy
[12:36:48] <feep[work]> way*
[12:37:14] <feep[work]> because there's no other part of json where you need to match a word
[12:37:38] <feep[work]> only true, false, null.
[12:37:46] <feep[work]> so just check t f n :D
[12:38:57] <nshepperd> but you still need to check the rest of the word
[12:39:18] <feep[work]> yes, but you can check and tell the compiler that this is an unlikely branch
[12:39:26] <PapuaHardyNet> .note feep in 254 hours look behind you
[12:39:39] <feep[work]> meaning it can ensure that the initial prediction is to pass the branch
[12:40:00] <nshepperd> it's not actually doing less work, it's just not reporting what it's actually doing in the error message
[12:40:02] <feep[work]> also if you have branches for all four letters, if you're parsing a big json message all those will be hot in the processor's pred table 
[12:40:08] <feep[work]> and all of them will be correctly predicted every time.
[12:40:21] <feep[work]> yeah the error message is trash
[12:41:09] <feep[work]> what it should do is shift all five letters into a long and then compare once
[12:41:15] <feep[work]> but eh
[12:41:16] <capisce> would be nice to fall back to generate a more descriptive error message in the error case, while keeping the successful path fast

[13:05:25] <PapuaHardyNet> I think I have a plan: I'll have to use 8 layers and divide the optimizers of each layer in every device
[13:06:04] <PapuaHardyNet> and then... okay I don't think updating just a shard of the parameters is simple.

[14:49:58] <PapuaHardyNet> okay correction - you can use the default function, but only if you give local devices as an input
[14:50:46] <PapuaHardyNet> this is interesting - this means you cannot transfer data across TPU devices, but you can run computations across TPU devices? wtf? I imagine the specifc computations you can run are stuff like all-reduce or whatever
[14:51:23] <nshepperd2> yes
[14:51:51] <nshepperd2> to transfer stuff across all TPU devices you use stuff like jax.lax.all_gather

[14:53:58] <nshepperd2> you have to make sure that doesn't happen

[15:10:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: That post about sheep is mildly amusing as an excuse for the author to regurgitate their knowledge of medieval parchment-making practices, but - as in so many such cases - it runs right off the rails midway through:
[15:11:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: "A book may run a wizard up to 15gp to produce a single copy with copyists and specialties.  If he want to create copies, he multiplies his overhead to share with fellow wizards.  10 wizards in his guild is a 150gp cost — bringing the total to 165gp." ... but if he's in a guild, the guild pays for that sort of thing, and if he's not in a guild, why's he gonna make so many copies? Doesn't make sense! But actually
[15:11:07] <Obormot\Arcturus>  the worst is the next sentence:
[15:11:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: "This adds up to real money, forcing wizards to go adventuring to fund their book costs." ... WRONG! 165gp is absolutely pocket change by even level 5 (meanwhile, if you're below like level 10, what are you even writing that anyone gives a shit about reading??)
[15:12:27] <nshepperd2> magic missile for dummies
[15:14:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: I mean, let's just look at treasure values, shall we? Average recommended treasure value for a level 5 encounter is 1,600 gp. That's for *one encounter*, and not, say, "one whole dungeon filled with encounters" or "one adventure's worth of encounters". Of course that's split 4-6 ways (party size), but you go on one adventure and ... you have enough gold to pay for a small collection. At level 5.
[15:14:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: At level 15, average treasure value per encounter is 22,000 gp. At level 20, 80,000 gp. Yes, let's hear *all* about how producing books at 15 gp a pop is forcing wizards to go out adventuring...
[15:15:31] <PapuaHardyNet> nshepperd2: this is truly insane. The inputs are (8, ...) in every device, and what actually happens is that the computation SECRETLY occurs across (8 * devices, ...)
[15:15:48] <nshepperd2> yess
[15:15:50] <PapuaHardyNet> why make it implicit, why not make it explicit
[15:16:31] <PapuaHardyNet> my guess is that you cannot because all the code cannot reach outside its device, while only the jax.lax computations can due to access to low level API?
[15:16:45] <Betawolf> Nobody wants to admit that the wizards need gold to fund their succubi-summoning habits.
[15:16:48] <rsaarelm> You could have setting lore where the wizards need to be very senior scholars who own and have published lots of mundane books by the time they get far enough to do actual magic at level 1.
[15:16:59] <nshepperd2> idk what making it explicit would look like tbh
[15:17:03] <PapuaHardyNet> so it is like how humans cannot access or observe how they do certain mental processes like recognizing people's faces
[15:17:05] <rsaarelm> But I guess if this is specifically spellbooks then yeah, it's iffy.
[15:17:38] <rsaarelm> I sorta like the idea that wizard adventurers are squishy just because they're freakin' old by the time they can do even simple magic.
[15:18:04] <nshepperd2> its kind of an interesting design though ye
[15:18:41] <nshepperd2> like you write your program exactly as if it was running on one vm. but pmean is over all devices
[15:19:27] <PapuaHardyNet> so it is scalable across the number of devices without having to change anything in the code. interesting
[15:20:13] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: And, the even worse fallacy: that wizards have to adventure for gold! WRONG! Wizards have *plenty* of ways to make gold without ever leaving the safety of civilization! They can cast spells, for instance: standard fee for casting a level 1 spell is 10 gp. For a level 3 spell, 150 gp. For a level 6 spell, 660 gp. (Note that this does NOT include any special components that might be required, which the customer also
[15:20:13] <Obormot\Arcturus>  pays for.) So a level 5 wizards gets out of bed, prepares 1 level 3 spell (perhaps, Illusory Script, for a customer who wants to send a message that won't be read in transit) - this costs the wizard *nothing* - takes his 150 gp fee, and goes right back to bed. And he can do this *every day*. And that's if he only prepared and cast one spell per day. At level 5.
[15:20:20] <nshepperd2> yeah, you can write your program and test it on a v3-8 without having to change anything
[15:20:31] <nshepperd2> and then when it works switch to a pod for performance
[15:21:15] <PapuaHardyNet> interesting. This means I'm almost ready for primetime. I just need to implement your psum check, and create a script to split datasets and rsync them across TPUs and boom
[15:21:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: The actual reason wizards go out adventuring is not for gold but for *power*, i.e., experience points - and also to accomplish whatever other goals they might have, of course. But anyway, the whole "cost of parchment forces wizards to do whatever" thesis is complete nonsense.

[15:23:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Oh, and let's not even get started on the whole "access to parchment specialists is difficult and uncertain" thing, where the post author takes realities of medieval economics and social circumstances and imports them wholesale into D&D where it makes zero sense... come on! A settled (non-adventuring) wizard is going to be *absolutely loaded* if they have even the slightest inclination toward it. They can easily
[15:23:18] <Obormot\Arcturus>  *hire* a full-time parchmenter or what have you.
[15:24:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: In fact, in old school versions of D&D, it was *assumed* that mid-to-high-level adventurers are going to settle down, build strongholds, and found entire towns around those strongholds (as people settled near them for protection and such), and also have large contingents of followers (of various professions), and hired hands and henchment and so forth...
[15:25:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: And more: "Worse, to keep the books in good order for a long time, the wizard has to keep them somewhere high and dry.  The wizard needs a wizard tower with a library at the spire to keep away humidity and prevent accidental flooding.  But, light makes the ink fade, so the wizard keeps the books locked in an unlit room filled with smelly, smoking candles and wizard light.  Now, wizards are dwelling in the dark, in
[15:25:23] <Obormot\Arcturus>  wizard towers, to keep their books in working order." - WRONG!!! None of this is remotely necessary! Why? BECAUSE WIZARDS CAN FUCKING DO MAGIC
[15:27:23] <nshepperd2> isn't it actually UV that makes the ink fade
[15:27:35] <Obormot\Arcturus> quanticle: Anyway, this whole post is an example of that annoying phenomenon where some idiot learned a little (but not a lot) about D&D, had a dumb but funny idea, and then didn't think about whether that idea actually makes sense in the D&D context, and then bent, warped, and twisted the rules and realities of the game world to fit their dumb idea (which was also an excuse for them to show off their knowledge of some obscure
[15:27:35] <Obormot\Arcturus>  bullshit like how parchment is made)
[15:27:40] <nshepperd2> just put up a bunch of ever burning lanterns or whatever, no need to be in the dark
[15:27:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah lol
[15:27:54] <nshepperd2> not to mention maybe it's magic ink
[15:28:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Imagine thinking a wizard needs to use *actual candles* to illuminate an interior space
[15:28:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Instead of magic fucking light
[15:31:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Actually, in my "Tomb of Javid" dungeon, one of the features of the Antechamber to the Tomb, that's meant to show off how powerful and capable and wealthy a wizard Javid was, is a chandelier filled with actual candles - not illusions of candles, not candles with Continual Flame cast on them so they make magical light, but actual for-real lit candles that are actually burning - and which have each individually been wrapped in
[15:31:46] <Obormot\Arcturus>  what is in effect a time loop spell so that they don't ever go out)
[15:32:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> (This is possibly the least efficient and most magically demanding solution to the "how to make perpetual light" problem, which is exactly why Javid did it that way - just as a flex)
[15:32:39] <nshepperd2> nice
[15:33:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Point is, that's the kind of shit a high-level wizard can do just to show off

[18:28:35] <gwern> I'm not sure it'd be rational to move crypto-mining equipment. where to? with what power? will your equipment be worth anything by the time you manage to set up anywhere?
[18:29:15] <gwern> since cryptomining equipment depends solely on the power and internet, they can survive a lot of disruption. you flee, and it keeps on ticking and sending the mining rewards to your wallet in the clouds

The gold piece is merely the unit of valuation, and "1600 gp" indicates the average total market value of the loot. The actual stuff may be all sorts of things - coins (of various sorts, from copper to platinum), gems, valuable art objects, exotic materials (useful in alchemy or ritual
[18:43:19] <Obormot\Arcturus>  magic or what have you), and of course magic items (arms & armor, wands, staves, scrolls, potions, magic rings, etc., etc.)

[18:45:56] <PapuaHardyNet> oh btw kuudes ask dbohan what is his ETA to normal health, if he has any
[18:48:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Indeed the "treasure" can be even further removed from "literal currency". Kill a wyvern, inspect its corpse, find that its poison sacs are still intact - and someone in your group has the Poisonmaking skill? Extract those sacs, secure them appropriately, sell on market - easily 1k gp (as the main ingredient to make combat-ready wyvern poison which can be applied to a blade or arrow, market price 3,000 gp per dose)
[18:48:26] <kuudes> PapuaHardyNet, when I asked him about if he needs a bouncer, dbohdan: "I have a bouncer. But it would be a strain on my recovering brain, I'm afraid. Reading a flowing stream of text still ain't easy for me. And worse, the protracted bed rest and side effects exacerbated my neck issues, so typing for extended periods hurts."
[18:49:56] <PapuaHardyNet> ouch. I wonder what sickness he had that affected his brain so. Anyway, I'll be patient and wait
[18:50:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: And we can go further afield than that! Delve into an ancient tomb, find the walls covered with inscriptions in a lost language? Good thing we brought paper and charcoal! Take rubbings of the inscriptions; upon return to town, sell them to a loremaster or scholarly society - can they fetch a high price, if sufficiently rare and crucial to some research or knowledge? Absolutely! That's "treasure", why not?
[18:52:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: And more: killed a vicious manticore, found its lair - oh my, it was a mother protecting its newborn manticore babies! Well guess what: each one of the cuddly little flying death cannons has a market price of 4,000 gp
[18:55:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> In short, D&D adventurers don't find success by having a limited view of what constitutes treasure
[18:59:42] <Obormot\Arcturus> Of course, the problem of "this would be treasure if we could get it home, but, uh..." is indeed a real one. If you find a giant statue, all jewel-encrusted and made of rare ores and what have, in some deep undeground lair... well probably a collector would way big moneys for it, but how the hell are you going to get it out of there?
[19:00:07] <kuudes> dbohdan says "I'm guessing it will be one or two months before I can walk outside. "Normal health" is a relative. I was chronically ill with heart, neck, and other problems to begin with.
[19:00:07] <kuudes> But actually, I have discovered better meds and tested things thanks to this illness. If COVID didn't mess me up too much, I may end up in some respects healthier than I started." <- PapuaHardyNet

[23:15:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> Maybe that comment was a lie
[23:15:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Try it now
[23:16:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> Meanwhile, lol PHP: so to decode HTML entities, you use the function html_entity_decode. To encode HTML entities, you use ... html_entity_encode? Right?
[23:16:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> WRONG
[23:16:18] <Obormot\Arcturus> It's actually htmlentities
[23:16:19] <gwern> seems to work
[23:16:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Or, htmlspecialchars
[23:16:36] <Obormot\Arcturus> Depending on whether you want all your encodable characters encoded or only some
[23:16:42] <zebrask> Has anyone considered giving Matthew Perry some warships and sending them to Tokyo to see about re-opening Japan? Worked during the Tokugawa Shogunate...
[23:17:23] <zebrask> Plus, Friends ended a while ago and he'd probably be happy to have greater cultural relevance again.
[23:17:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: And now? Still works?

[23:26:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: The comment for the PNAS icon says it should be white on a black background... is that an idea we abandoned at some point and forgot to update the comment?
[23:27:41] <gwern> hm. I suspect we got stuck making the 4-square link icon and forgot completely about the background. I say scrap the idea.

[23:34:43] <ggreer> two2thehead: yeah living in the future is pretty fun. I think I remember how to gas up a car but I haven't tried in years
[23:35:40] <ggreer> I'm not sure about plugs in parking lots and stuff. most of the time your car is at home or parked on the street next to your home. or it's at work
[23:39:03] <gwern> such suburban homeowner privilege
[23:39:03] <ggreer> right now the main advantage of EV chargers in shopping centers is that I get to park close to the entrance

[23:40:39] <ggreer> I was thinking more along the lines of chances of vandalism or bogarting. once you add the inconvenience of paying for charging (which is a nightmare if you're not using a tesla), it's not worth the hassle
[23:41:26] <ggreer> with a tesla you plug in and it automatically bills you. with everything else you have to install an app on your phone and scan a QR code and stuff

[23:49:16] <ggreer> I think EV manufacturers are working on a unified billing standard, but it'll probably require hardware changes to EVs
[23:53:09] <gwern> (tesla is so far beyond the others now I wonder if standards are still in their self-interest)
[23:54:44] <kuudes> I still don't understand why people travelled during the pandemic if their governments told them not to
[23:55:20] <kuudes> I mean, I guess I understand if you had a dying family member or something
[23:55:33] <kuudes> but just for work, it feels odd priorities to me
[23:55:41] <kuudes> or even more for leisure
[23:57:23] <kuudes> are they stupid?
[23:57:45] <kuudes> it seems you won't randomly get travel accidentally, that seems quite rare
[23:57:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: For some people, if their government tells them not to do a thing, they don't care, because they don't trust the government, and don't think the government has their best interests in mind
[23:57:58] <kuudes> sure, but then they get to eat the result
[23:58:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> kuudes: Note that, in the great majority of nations of the world, they are correct in thinking so
[23:58:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> Our government sure doesn't have our best interests in mind!
[23:58:22] <kuudes> it is not about trust, but if the government has said that it closes the border, why does one disbelieve it
[23:58:30] <ggreer> all tesla chargers in the netherlands are open to non-teslas. they're slowly rolling that out in other places
[23:58:31] <kuudes> it is the government. it can do that.
[23:58:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> I guess I'm not sure what you're asking
[23:58:48] <ggreer> non-teslas need an adapter. not sure how much it costs
[23:58:58] <kuudes> it just seems stupid for me for people to leave the country when their government says they might not be able to return
[23:59:12] <Obormot\Arcturus> Are you suggesting that, like, there are people who drove up to the U.S./Canada border and were like "wtf, it's actually closed? I thought they were just kidding about that lol"
[23:59:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> Oh I see
[23:59:22] <capisce> kuudes: the Japan situation seems different, since they let in citizens but not non-citizen residents
