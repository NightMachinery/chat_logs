[05:21:52] <MootPoot> ButterNoodle: I have a question - the exsi docs dont give me a clear answer without 3 hours of digging
[05:22:06] <MootPoot> does 1 logical core = 1 vcore for a VM?
[05:23:03] <MootPoot> I cant use all 12 threads? do I need to save 1 so I exsi can run
[05:29:54] <ButterNoodle> threads can be cores
[05:30:09] <ButterNoodle> think of it as load slots
[05:30:40] <MootPoot> yea - from the POV of exsi there are 12 threads available 
[05:30:43] <ButterNoodle> u have 12 threads.. u can hand that out as 12 cores, 6 cores 2 threads, 2 cores, 6 threads
[05:30:48] <ButterNoodle> it dont care
[05:31:01] <MootPoot> nani
[05:31:04] <MootPoot> I dont follow
[05:31:09] <MootPoot> 1 core only has 2 threads
[05:31:09] <ButterNoodle> its just load
[05:31:15] <MootPoot> OHHH
[05:31:22] <MootPoot> okay, so its completely abstract
[05:31:25] <ButterNoodle> yep
[05:31:30] <ButterNoodle> you can map 1:1
[05:31:34] <ButterNoodle> but I dont recommend
[05:31:39] <MootPoot> so it dosen't give a fuck how many vcores I give it - it'll just divide it up accordingly
[05:31:50] <ButterNoodle> ye
[05:32:05] <ButterNoodle> thats why u can have more cores assigned than u have in the box
[05:32:06] <MootPoot> I can have 1 vm with 500 cores, but those 500 cores will just map to like 12 actual treads
[05:32:08] <MootPoot> threads*
[05:32:14] <MootPoot> woah
[05:32:15] <MootPoot> cool shit
[05:32:22] <ButterNoodle> *havent tried that
[05:32:35] <MootPoot> with virualbox on my pc I always just mapped 1;!
[05:32:37] <MootPoot> 1:1
[05:33:34] <MootPoot> so I guess a better way to put it is
[05:34:18] <MootPoot> 12 cores = 100% cpu power -> then if I have 2 vm's with say, 50 cores each then it'll split that 100% 2 ways , effectively giving them the power of 6 actual threads each
[05:34:21] <MootPoot> interesting
[05:34:31] <MootPoot> wait
[05:34:34] <ButterNoodle> yea there are limits
[05:34:43] <ButterNoodle> 16 cores for the most part
[05:34:48] <MootPoot> if that's the case, then what's the point of paying for more Vcores on a VPS? 
[05:35:00] <MootPoot> if it is all dynamically allocated anyway
[05:35:10] <ButterNoodle> well if u have 1 core
[05:35:16] <ButterNoodle> 1 vcore
[05:35:29] <ButterNoodle> if ur system load is at 1 - ur %100
[05:36:05] <ButterNoodle> if there are more cores than whats available to the scheduler, then its pointless
[05:36:10] <MootPoot> ic
[05:36:11] <MootPoot> yhc
[05:36:13] <MootPoot> thx*
[05:36:34] <ButterNoodle> thats the reason for virtualization.. most hardware sits idle

[12:00:17] <dweltstorm> i guess you're right
[12:00:31] <dweltstorm> maybe the real facism was the parts of it we absorped along the way

[12:01:44] <dweltstorm> very true

[12:02:28] <dweltstorm> probably not

[12:02:50] *** Joins: Abrax (~Abrax@user/abrax)
[12:03:32] <dweltstorm> well i mean the definition of facism says that it has an autocratic government lead by a dictator

[12:03:38] <dweltstorm> im not sure if that describes the us
[12:03:42] <DunceCotus> because they're backstabbing fascists
[12:04:08] <DunceCotus> dweltstorm: fascism is not simply about a dictator
[12:04:15] <DunceCotus> but about rulers
[12:04:44] <DunceCotus> rigid hierarchies justified on spurious terms
[12:05:32] <DunceCotus> half-baked philosophy of the masses to play into the masses desiring their own repression (more authoritarian control over lives)
[12:05:49] <dweltstorm> could you give an example of this?
[12:06:25] <DunceCotus> dweltstorm: the bureaucracies of power
[12:06:42] <DunceCotus> dweltstorm: people with capital are the rulers basically
[12:06:56] <DunceCotus> then you have sub-rulers, those who facilitate these players' accumulation
[12:06:59] <DunceCotus> political sub-rulers
[12:07:26] <DunceCotus> the inability to change this situation is due to blockages erected by the rulers/sub-rulers
[12:07:36] <DunceCotus> such as local or state bureaucracy
[12:07:39] <dweltstorm> how would people with capital be rulers
[12:07:58] <DunceCotus> well they have the most political and economic capital
[12:08:02] <DunceCotus> sooo
[12:08:19] <dweltstorm> true true
[12:08:26] <DunceCotus> they are not the rulers of old, or like dictatorial like Hitler
[12:08:39] <DunceCotus> but their rule is composed of assemblages of microfascisms
[12:09:24] <DunceCotus> which could manifest in, "well CEOs create a lot of jobs and do a lot of hard work, they deserve to have billions of dollars -- and someday any one of us could be where they are!"
[12:09:45] <DunceCotus> the little justifications for absolute power
[12:10:34] <dweltstorm> right
[12:10:41] <DunceCotus> or.. "Immigrants have stolen our jobs, we need to close the borders and deport (or worse) the immigrants! Also the immigrants are dirty, immoral, evil, goblins etc." 
[12:11:06] <dweltstorm> the people with billions of dollars have more control, and this is justified bc people have been told that they can be that succesful if they just

[15:11:27] <DPA> "everyone is happy" doesn't require everything to be nice and well. It's conceivable a world where people are perfectly happy while dying of hunger and so on could exist. Happiness is simply a state, so if it was to be forced somehow, other problems wouldn't just go away.
[15:13:23] <DPA> "everyone was a high school girl" also has problems. People have limited live spans, unless that's changed, humanity would die out eventually.
[15:13:54] <amigojapan> DPA: hmm that is some tricky geany level
[15:18:31] <amigojapan> DPA: I remember when I was a kid I once wished into a well that "no wish I ever made would come true if it would hurt me"
[15:19:27] <DPA> You mean genie/jinn? I know they are often represented as tricking people, but it's usually really just people being unprecise and not thinking things through.
[15:20:08] <amigojapan> Yes DPA , that is what I meant
[15:20:57] <amigojapan> DPA: I think I made that wish into the well after finding out about evil geanies
[15:23:16] <DPA> Yea, there are a few flaws with it. For example, it's possible a wish by itself wouldn't hurt you, but it may indirectly worsen your future situation in a way which does cause harm. So it wouldn't be the wish hurting you, but other things resulting from it's side effects.
[15:24:32] <DPA> Like, for example, wishing not to feel pain would still be valid and not hurt you, but it'd be a massive problem which could result in you harming yourself later on.
[15:26:18] <amigojapan> I see DPA , what would you wish for?

[15:36:47] <amigojapan> Welcome to the world of the awoken MootPoot 
[15:36:59] <DPA> Hm, I'd wish for the ability to change how the universe functions programmatically, and run programs in universe itself, by some mean I'd not accidentally invoke.
[15:36:59] <DPA> Then, I'd first create some sub-programming language running in a arbitrarily definable sandbox / test area, with version control, to safely test things out.
[15:36:59] <DPA> And then, I'd create a system anyone could use where people could essentially replicate, teleport, change, etc. anything anywhere, using some simple accessible UX.
[15:36:59] <DPA> But first, I'd add features to let them restore things to proper states, and let them enable/disable a subsystem that'd stop anything that would harm them imminently, with the goal of not preventing crime & destruction, but to make it meaningless & so bad anymore.
[15:37:47] <DPA> *prior states
[15:38:17] <DPA> *not so bad anymore
[15:39:18] <amigojapan> DPA: I guess if we knew before hand that the geanie was evil, we may as well just walk away Withought making a wish
[15:42:09] <DPA> I don't know. I think I'd still give it a try. Sure, it may turn out very bad, but even so, I'd probably not have the oppurtunity ever again.

[15:45:17] <amigojapan> I see

[15:53:14] <DPA> If I was an evil geanie, I think I'd take the job of santa claus. As far as we know, the position seams to be vacant, and gets plenty of wishes.

For example, If the geanie becomes happy by breaking out of the bottle, for people in prisons the same means to happiness may mean breaking out of prison and not having to go back. Not a bad end goal, but without reintegration, would still end badly.

[17:11:04] <analoq> ketchupicecream2: you can use gdpr as a basis but, gdpr itself doesnt do anything. theres no gdpr agency that actively sues people.
[17:12:13] <analoq> we had somethign similar 20years ago in germany. webpages here need to have a dedicated easily reachable page that lists the owners credentials. If you lack that you may get sued for it. but these laws have little effect for non germans/ non europeans
[17:12:29] <ketchupicecream2> analoq: yeah that's why i used they lol since I didn't know of any authority that enforces compliance
[17:12:38] <analoq> if someone from the eu sues amigojapan he can just ignore it. what are they going to do lol
[17:14:40] <ketchupicecream2> flip an ascii bird in reply
[17:14:56] <DPA> Do I even need a cookie hint if the cookies I use are not to track people, but only to remember site settings? Like, the theme & language they selected, so I can let them keep using the theme and language they selected, for example.
[17:16:08] <ketchupicecream2> libredd.it doesn't have a cookie warning
[17:16:16] <analoq> I don't think so. gdpr is about privacy, if your cookie doesnt infringe on it, it shouldn't be a concern

[17:17:51] <ketchupicecream2> and ddg too
[17:18:16] <DPA> The whole cookie thing doesn't even make much sense anymore anyway. They used to be sharable across domains, but nowadays, browsers block that anyway, I think. (But there are other ways to do the same tracking anyway, without cookies).
[17:19:29] <amigojapan> analoq: I have Google analytics on my page. I think they use cookies to track people
[17:24:25] <amigojapan> DPA: if even we, the experts can't see exactly why gdrp requires it, how is a non trained person supposed to make the decision to accept cookies or not

[17:27:13] <DPA> Usually, the one really needed can't be deselected in those dialogs anyway. So deselecting all is usually fine. But I wish they'd required sites to honor the DNT header, and browsers to make it easy to turn on / off, instead of the cookie nonsense.
[17:28:43] <ketchupicecream2> gdpr needs to enforce a decline option on cookie popups
[17:29:16] <ketchupicecream2> instead of merely enforcing a collection notice
[17:29:53] <ketchupicecream2> kinda like what apple did

[17:31:03] <isekaijin> ketchupicecream2: Why should a website owner / operator allow you to use their website without cookies, though?
[17:31:28] <isekaijin> If the user doesn't like the terms of service, he or she can simply... not use the website.
[17:31:34] <amigojapan> Agree DPA 
[17:31:35] <ketchupicecream2> cause they want my business
