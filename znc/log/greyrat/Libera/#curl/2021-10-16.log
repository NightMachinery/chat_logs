[11:46:14] <earnestly> Youtube's rss feeds are causing curl to return 'curl: (23) Failed writing received data to disk/application' when using --parallel (individual curl calls to single urls appear to work okay).  Very rarely one may work but generally they all fail.  This is somewhat recent change and it is probably on youtube's side since I don't recall curl changing
