[00:06:49] <CarloWood> I should know this... but
[00:08:12] <CarloWood> if thread A stores to a variable x using std::memory_order::relaxed, and thread B keeps loading x with std::memory_order::relaxed until it sees the value that A did write (which it does only once),

[00:09:00] <CarloWood> then thread C obtains a mutex that previously was locked by B - feels like a memory barrier no?
[00:09:32] <CarloWood> Is it then guaranteed that thread C also will see the same value that B did see when reading x with std::memory_order::relaxed?
[00:10:35] *** Quits: RoKenn (~RoKenn@user/rokenn) (Quit: NSA proxy service interrupted)
[00:11:28] <CarloWood> I think it has to be the case - because the reading in C is theoretically identical to thread B reading it; that should be guaranteed by using the critical area; so if B saw a value then C can't see a value from before that (in the past).

[00:12:27] <ville> thread C could be on a different cpu/core/whatnot?
[00:12:34] <CarloWood> yes
[00:14:18] <ville> so wondering if that could change the reasoning here
[00:14:21] <CarloWood> Reading relaxed is the same as non-atomic I think.  So the situation is:  B: { std::lock_guard lk; int r = x; assert(r == expected); } happened before C: { std::lock_guard lk; int r = x; assert(r == expected); }
[00:14:39] <CarloWood> Given that the first assert holds - the second also much hold I think.
[00:15:05] <CarloWood> where x is non-atomic or atomic and read with relaxed, doesn't matter no?
[00:15:30] <RandomReader> why would reading in C be identical to reading in B?
[00:15:56] <CarloWood> because C obtained the mutex after B released it

[00:18:06] <ville> A and B ran on same level of the cache hierarchy, C needed it to propagate to a higher level and back down to see the value
[00:18:14] <CarloWood> I think the unlock works as a release and the lock as an acquire - so anything written by B would be visible by C; in this case B doesn't write anything, but it loops until it sees a certain value - that is the same thing imho

[00:18:58] <RandomReader> the synchronization modeling is usually about the chain "store here -> load here", but I don't know that it says anything about loads directly
[00:19:13] <CarloWood> RandomReader: that is true and the source of my uncertainty :/
[00:19:19] <RandomReader> a store and a load are definitely not the same things, you'd need something more specific to make that leap
[00:19:47] <RandomReader> in particular you're not actually doing anything that guarantees a particular original store will be observed by B, as in there's nothing being synchronized
[00:19:55] <RandomReader> so there's no particular reason for that same non-synchronized thing to appear in C
[00:20:00] <CarloWood> by C you mean?
[00:20:05] <RandomReader> no, by B
[00:20:17] <RandomReader> you're looping and checking observation, but not *synchronizing*
[00:20:21] <CarloWood> It is just a given that B reads the right value.
[00:20:29] <CarloWood> yes
[00:20:50] <RandomReader> you're asserting that by outside knowledge that isn't part of the system model
[00:21:10] <CarloWood> Well... I agree it might just not work... But it is SOOOO hard to test it with the available tools :(
[00:21:13] <RandomReader> if it's not part of the system model, why would it be synchronized?  is the question to answer
[00:21:52] <RandomReader> as far as I know there isn't a rule that guarantees it, which is about the only thing you can answer .. other than maybe that memory model tool
[00:22:03] <RandomReader> a practical test would be a non-answer, so not useful

[01:55:52] <CarloWood> I want thread A to generate something one-time and write it to a variable. After that that variable will only read - ever, the rest of the execution of the program.
[01:56:20] <CarloWood> I refuse to lock a mutex every time I access it to read it (that's the whole reason I'm caching it there in the first place)
[01:56:50] <CarloWood> So, I want one thread to write to it - and assure that all other threads will read what that thread wrote WITHOUT using a mutex ;)
[01:57:54] <CarloWood> Now, what I *can* do ('easily') is check that the variable was written with thread B - but that is then a thread of a "task" object, a random thread of a thread pool.
[01:58:11] <CarloWood> So, the next time that 'task' runs it could be a different thread (thread C).
[01:58:12] <CarloWood> :/
[01:59:44] <CarloWood> In practice no synchronization will be needed I think - but I HATE races - even if they don't happen in practice.  I mean - I could write to it and sleep for 10 ms. But that isn't good enough for me :/. I want it officially correct.

[12:59:21] <GyrosGeier> AmR, removing branches is different from removing if statements
[13:00:28] <GyrosGeier> the reason people want to avoid branches is that they cost performance, and may be a security issue if they depend on secret data
[13:01:12] <GyrosGeier> but "bool x = (a == b);" can use a branch or not, depending on the architecture
[13:01:53] <GyrosGeier> in the same way "if(a == b) x = true; else x = false;" can use a branch or not depending on the architecture
[13:02:27] <ville> also if this is still in the context of doing something with the filesystem then branch here or ten branches there is not going to register compared to the cost of hitting the filesystem

[14:44:48] <PJBoy> nah
[14:46:09] <PJBoy> uint16_t(0x8000) gets promoted to int32_t(0x00008000), shifted left as if into uint32_t(0x80000000) and converted to int32_t(0x80000000)
[14:46:42] <GyrosGeier> it's a shift of a signed value into the signbit, no?
[14:46:46] <PJBoy> where the conversion to signed at the end is implementation defined
[14:46:51] <PJBoy> prior to C++20

[14:50:43] <PJBoy> see, compiler's happy
[14:51:03] <PJBoy> and then interestingly, in C++20 that first test isn't an error anymore

[17:59:42] <CarloWood> ville: it "runs" the program using every possible execution that is consistent with the memory model; so if there is ANY way the program would ever produce certain results, it executes that and you get to see multiple printf's.

[19:35:08] <acidtonic_> I am blending a C library into a C++ class and must provide a raw char array to the library which used to be a global, I'm now using a class member but now must be careful about moving that memory, is it safe enough to declare the class uncopyable or should I stop moving too? If I wanted to make a move constructor to keep that memory in the same place, could I do so with placement new or something tricky?

[19:48:09] <acidtonic_> welder, no the C library uses other threads to then read/write that array so if it changes address the copy never gets touched by the C lib. So it can't move I think. But I'd like to see if there is a way to use a move constructor to keep the address the same upon move for that array

[20:49:42] <imMute> CarloWood: yes, but in the OS not in the application
[20:50:05] <imMute> CarloWood: maybe not O(n) maybe something like O(log n) - depends on how the OS organizes the name lookups
[20:50:11] <imMute> but it's certainly not constant
[20:50:41] <CarloWood> Nothing is constant - also reading an atomic int varies in how long it takes.
[20:50:59] *** Joins: Brainium (~brainium@user/brainium)
[20:51:12] <Alipha> and even so, if the lookup were constant, i would imagine that the OS API call would do additional work if the file is found (check permissions, retrieve additional information that you just end up discarding, etc) than if the file is not found
[20:51:34] <jimbzy> Alipha, Does that hold true for real-time OSes, or is it just something that's not done in real-time computing?
[20:51:35] <imMute> CarloWood: reading an atomic int should be O(1) since it doesn't matter how many atomic ints you have or the actual value of it affecting the lookup time.
[20:52:03] <imMute> O(1) doesn't mean it'll always take X seconds to do, where X doesn't change.  it just means X is independent of the value/number of items
[20:52:44] <imMute> jimbzy: real time OSes will still not be constant time, but they'll typically have a guaranteed upper bound.

[20:54:16] <imMute> constant as in using a stopwatch to measure.  not the big-O notation definition of "constant"
[20:54:34] <CarloWood> Then read again my reaction to that.
[20:55:15] <jimbzy> Gotcha
[20:55:29] <imMute> I guess my point is that O(1) doesn't say anything about how much wall clock time an operation will take
[20:55:39] <jimbzy> I knew that, too.  I'm just a bit spaced atm.
[20:56:25] <Alipha> AmR: making code time-constant is difficult and requires quite a bit of expertise. note that other operations, such as &&, ||, ==, !, etc may result in the compiler generating an if statement in the assembly code. or even when compiled with optimizations, a compiler may be "too smart" and transform your time-constant code into something non-time-constant because it's more efficient. also note that you don't have
[20:56:27] <Alipha> to eliminate "all if statements"--you only have to eliminate if statements that are in the middle of working with secret data.

[20:57:29] <CarloWood> That was my point :p - it was me who brought up big-O, when Alipha said "you really can't check for a file's existance in constant time because the OS will almost certainly have variations in timings which you cannot control".  The phrase "in constant time" here is dubious. Of course the exact timing can vary between 1 micro second and 1 second - but since nothing is constant it HAS to mean O(1) and then I wanted to troll by
[20:57:29] <CarloWood> pointing out that it IS O(1).
[20:57:41] <CarloWood> Sorry for the trolling :p
[20:59:03] <imMute> file name lookups (and thus existence checks) are neither O(1) nor a "constant" wall clock time, since the lookup depends on the number of directories that the FS has as well as how many levels the path being looked up has.

[23:36:33] <river> if you check man operator, we can see that ++ binds tighter than *, so it's *(p++), that means it will give you *p as a value, but it will increment the pointer p
[23:36:56] <river> be careful not to have another use of p in any expression containing *(p++)
