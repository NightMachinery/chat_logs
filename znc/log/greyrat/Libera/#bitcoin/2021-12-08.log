[18:18:05] <Guest00> So I sent $1 USD which was 0.00002029 then I used electrum which asked for mBTC which I put 0.02029
[18:19:08] *** Quits: OPK (~OPK@user/opk) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[18:19:23] <Guest00> Why is it showing in that link it says " 0.00002029 BTC was sent with a value of $1.02. The current value of this transaction is now $1.02." which is over $1

[18:22:18] <Guest00> it looks like the previous transaction has more in it but why?
[18:23:24] <zemzem> So you made a transaction for $1 and now it says you sent $1.02? Isnt electrum just accounting for change in price?
[18:23:26] <Guest00> does it purposely overpay > $1 to account for fees so that you always receive $1 exactly?
[18:23:33] <zemzem> Guest00: let me know if thats what youre asking

[18:25:30] <Guest00> Yes to the first question. I am not sure for the second question. Here is what electrum says https://imgur.com/a/hWlaeOI
[18:26:49] <Guest00> is it because way back in the past when I was testing this i perhaps sent a partial payment and along the way it picked up the extra amount?
[18:27:15] <zemzem> Guest00: has the price changed any further since it went to 1.02?
[18:27:52] <Guest00> not really i did this less than an hour ago. If you refresh the blockchain.com link it says what the current amount is
[18:29:13] <zemzem> Could have been a fluctuation in price as you sent. You input sending a dollar in btc, then before you broadcast the transaction the price had a small increase.
[18:29:23] <zemzem> Thats my guess if it hasnt been changing any further since you noticed
[18:29:41] <zemzem> I hope Im understanding your question correctly
[18:30:27] <Guest00> maybe. i think you are understanding it

[18:34:49] <Guest00> I have a question about this one. On the bottom why do the outputs split in 2?
[18:35:39] <zemzem> I would say your customer paid the $1 they were supposed to. It just so happens as they send their transaction, that same amount of bitcoin is now worth 2 cents more.
[18:36:06] <Guest00> ok that makes sense then
[18:36:14] <Guest00> if it was LN it would probably be $1 exactly?
[18:37:19] <Guest00> I guess I will just put in ToS that it is possible in the blockchain the value will appear higher due to volatility
[18:37:26] <zemzem> Im not sure that would make a difference. If youre still sending btc, and the price of btc is going up, you could end up with the same situation. I would say LN leaves less room for that being how fast transactions are signed/completed on LN wallets

[18:46:00] <Guest00> The reason why I ask is I am trying to get an accurate number to give to an accountant - something like the net value USD. But maybe like with trading where you only report tax if you sell for capital gains, I think it will be hard to report this
[18:46:26] <Guest00> Like I don't think I can report $1 I would have to report $1.03
[18:47:01] <Guest00> the value at the time of the transaction, not the current value unless I sell
[18:47:03] <zemzem> No, you just report the amount of bitcoin that was sent, and at what price it was sent

[20:57:41] <buZz> steerpike wants that nickname but its the primary account of that person
[20:57:57] <buZz> and its unused for 8 weeks just now
[20:58:04] <buZz> so , would they need to wait longer?
[20:58:07] <A_Dragon> Yes
[20:58:09] <A_Dragon> 20 weeks
[20:58:28] <buZz> even while its the primary account a person logs in with?
[20:58:33] <dodo> steerpike: ask in #libera about nick expiry
[20:58:37] <A_Dragon> nickname unused for 20 weeks
[20:58:37] <buZz> but not using the nickname attacked to it?
[20:58:40] <A_Dragon> correct
[20:58:45] <dodo> afaik you have to use the nicks
[20:58:47] <buZz> dodo: they did, but couldnt get help at the time
[20:58:52] <buZz> A_Dragon: cool!
[20:58:57] <buZz> thanks for clearing that up
[20:58:58] <dodo> ah well, try when staff is online
[20:59:00] <A_Dragon> they should still repeat the question here
[20:59:03] <A_Dragon> dodo: I am staff :P
[20:59:04] <buZz> dodo: A_Dragon is one of the staff
[20:59:23] <dodo> alrighty
[20:59:28] <A_Dragon> in fact Im even on /stats p right now
[20:59:41] <moonmoon> I can fix that
[20:59:42] <buZz> ooo nice, i felt a bit bad asking you randomly
[20:59:52] <buZz> ah moonmoon is also staff :)
[20:59:54] <A_Dragon> currently trying to think of how to make my aoc code faster
[20:59:56] <A_Dragon> moonmoon: RUDE!
[20:59:59] <moonmoon> :D
[21:00:04] <A_Dragon> /helperificate moonmoon
[21:00:13] <moonmoon> fiiiiiiiiine
[21:00:23] <A_Dragon> lol
[21:00:28] <A_Dragon> come help me with AoC
[21:00:48] <A_Dragon> "just bruteforce your way into figuring out if this is the right one"
[21:03:23] <moonmoon> also maybe some confusion about nick expiry above. Nicks that are the primary account name don't expire unless the *entire account* is unused for 20 weeks. So if they're using a different nick but still logged into the account, it'll keep the primary nick alive
[21:04:34] <moonmoon> would have to get the owner to release it for you in that case (by setting their accountname to something else). If it's being held in bad faith we can release it even if it's not expired, but that's difficult to prove
[21:04:38] <buZz> moonmoon: damn :(
[21:04:45] <buZz> thats a sad story for them then
[21:05:08] <buZz> getting evidence for that is near impossible
