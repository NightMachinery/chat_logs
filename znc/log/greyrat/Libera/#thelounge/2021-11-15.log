[00:24:55] <bookworm> Actually, did you try ident?

[00:31:33] <bookworm> as for adding new users, yeah just use `thelounge add` and feed it the password
[00:33:48] <CSC346> The point of this project is to make a CGI interface that spins up AWS instances and destroys them when they're done.  I haven't bothered with ident becuase thelounge will be the only client capable of accessing the server.  Having the login name be the same as the nick was just sort of a continuity feature I wanted to put in.  I'm not sure
[00:33:48] <CSC346> automating ident setup is worth the trouble for such a trivial feature.

[00:37:16] <bookworm> well, considerding that you are in a container just use the internal ident functionality, you run TL as "root" within the container anyhow do you?
[00:37:31] <bookworm> or how do you spin up TL?
[00:37:40] <bookworm> as an actual host install?
[00:38:13] <bookworm> also, your users, `thelounge add $user --password $password` btw, not redirection from  a file
[00:40:05] <CSC346> after spinning up the AWS image (and installing docker, not sure if it's there already I haven't gotten that far yet) I run this command:
[00:40:12] <CSC346> docker run --detach --name lounge --publish 80:9000 --volume ~/.thelounge:/var/opt/thelounge --restart always thelounge/thelounge:latest
[00:42:17] <bookworm> ah, so not root then
[00:42:51] <bookworm> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-docker#configuring-identd
[00:44:37] <CSC346> technically root but the image is good to go and I can swap out the config file, add users as node, and restart TL to be up and running.
[00:45:06] <bookworm> yeah but you're not running TL as root within the container but node

[00:47:04] <CSC346> right.  The add users part needs to be run as node

[00:53:49] <bookworm> do you see the user you expect?
[00:53:55] <CSC346> yes
[00:54:35] <bookworm> as for https, that certainly ain't it
[00:54:48] <bookworm> are you sure the password is correct?
[00:54:52] <bookworm> try resetting it
[00:55:19] <CSC346> I did both of those, no dice
[00:56:54] <bookworm> how did you specify the password?
[00:57:14] <CSC346> I typed it in manually.  I'm not scripting anything yet
[00:57:16] <bookworm> via the shell directly (--password $x) or by manually writing it out interactively ?
[00:58:17] <bookworm> can you try a dead simple pw just to test it out? It's not internet accessible if I understood you correctly right?
[00:58:22] <bookworm> say asdf
[00:58:45] <CSC346> I made it the same as the user name
[00:59:17] <bookworm> that doesn't matter either, my test instance does the same ;)
[00:59:40] <bookworm> test: test, like the security conscious developer I am :P
[01:00:49] <CSC346> I'm not using TL on AWS at the moment.  I have docker running on my laptop.  No worry about simple passwords for now
[01:02:13] <CSC346> besides, even if it were on AWS the point of the project is to destroy the server when I'm done so I'm not worried about any kind of data loss

[01:21:55] <bookworm> CSC346: you can play around with that to test your pw... lift the hash from the user config file under $THELOUNGE_HOME/users/ and shove it into the quotes in the first argument, the expected pw in the lower https://play.golang.org/p/OCM47VjC0kT
[01:22:15] <bookworm> naturally don't do this for anything actually secret... 
[01:31:12] <CSC346> that worked.  Is it trying to submit to port 9000 perhaps?
[01:32:01] <bookworm> that worked as in the pw hash and the password when you type it are the same?
[01:32:35] <CSC346> yeah, the hash and password worked on the script you published
[01:32:48] <bookworm> substituted with yours, yes :P ?
[01:32:53] <CSC346> yes
[01:33:04] <bookworm> sorry for asking, but you never know
[01:33:16] <bookworm> TL still refuses that exact same password?
[01:33:37] <CSC346> yes
[01:34:42] <bookworm> what's the output in the log when that happens?
[01:35:41] <bookworm> as in, the TL server log
[01:36:02] <bookworm> because that's not making much sense to me... TL simply does the equivalent of the go code I gave you

[01:37:45] <bookworm> if it's anything other than >[WARN] Authentication failed for user $user from $remote_ip it didn't talk to TL

[01:41:44] <bookworm> as in, the exact command
[01:42:52] <CSC346> I'm not sure.  I've restarted the container a couple times and I've tried "thelounge start" as node
[01:43:19] <bookworm> so you still have the container around then? Good, shut it down
[01:43:55] <bookworm> now, do me a favor and first past the exact CLI you plan to run to start the container in here
[01:44:01] <bookworm> paste*
[01:44:45] <CSC346> I've just been using the GUI on docker desktop
[01:46:14] <bookworm> and what does the GUI say about volumes?
[01:46:59] <CSC346> ps -aux does show two instances running
[01:47:17] <bookworm> kill both I'd say
[01:47:31] <bookworm> then make sure that the one started really is the one that has the corresponding user file

[01:48:21] <bookworm> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge-docker#data-directory
[01:48:24] <CSC346> killing either forces the container to close.  one is ruunning as root the other as node
[01:48:44] <bookworm> that's not container instances, but processes
[01:49:13] <bookworm> containers != processes, but you can have multiple containers from the same image at the same time, naturally not on the same ports
[01:49:26] <bookworm> docker ps is the command iirc
[01:49:29] <CSC346> I only have one container
[01:49:35] <bookworm> then again, been a while since I last used docker

[19:54:58] <toro> I have a question that isn’t urgent, as I’m not even at a system I can get into the irc network right this instant. But we are testing a install of 4.2.0 and we have…. idk a bunch of totally tech illiterate people accustomed to only being prompted to enter a nickname and a password if they have one
[19:55:16] <toro> they’re entering as “philthelounge” and “Jamiethelounge” etc
[19:55:19] <toro> It’s fun to watch but
[19:55:30] <toro> Can I edit the login page and leave the nickname box black
[19:55:37] <toro> Blank *
[19:55:42] <toro> And get rid of the username option ?
[19:55:47] <toro> Where would that be
[19:55:48] <toro> Thank you
[19:56:36] <toro> Debian flavor .Deb install with default locations btw
[19:57:39] <toro> It’s fun having 70 year olds crying because there are too many options
[19:58:29] <xnaas> toro: this section may or may not answer some of your question: https://thelounge.chat/docs/configuration#default-network
[20:00:16] <toro> That’s closer thank you
[20:00:31] <toro> can I make nick “” and force them to choose a nickname ?
[20:00:44] <toro> and or suppress them from seeing username on the login screen v
[20:00:45] <toro> ?
[20:01:05] <toro> That would totally resolve it and I’d tell them to just ignore the other boxes
[20:01:07] <toro> thanks
[20:01:41] <xnaas> Never tried setting it blank. I have a hosted webchat instance I can test it on, I guess.
[20:02:10] <toro> ok cool. That works on self hosted kiwi it doesn’t work on the public kiwiirc.com is why I ask
[20:02:19] <toro> “nick=“ I mean
[20:02:53] <xnaas> it looks like setting it blank puts back in "thelounge"
[20:03:39] <xnaas> you can put it as " " but then there's literally a space at the beginning
[20:04:11] <xnaas> which will be more confusing if they don't backspace the space, since it'll error with the space there :P
[20:04:24] <xnaas> I suppose you could change it to "CHANGEME" lol
[20:08:34] <bookworm> toro: just hide the username field with CSS, it doesn't matter much
[20:09:18] <toro> ahh that’s the answer I’m looking for. where is the css and or html for this ?
[20:09:36] <toro> I didn’t do the install so this will be my first dive into it
[20:09:43] *** Joins: eliocamp (~eliocamp@user/eliocamp)

[20:11:03] <toro> probably verbatim
[20:11:07] <xnaas> I assumed a non-printing space would be the same issue as a printing space.
[20:11:08] <bookworm> https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/blob/fd730eeeb14101199d8ba121fa081c2e1e02ff87/defaults/config.js#L103 set that to your custom theme
[20:11:22] <toro> perfect ok thanks for the pointers
[20:11:35] <bookworm> xnaas: nick has a rather restricted char set
[20:11:56] <xnaas> which makes sense
[20:11:56] <bookworm> a-Z0-9-_ iirc
[20:12:22] <toro> ah to keep people from using invalid chars
[20:13:06] <bookworm> no because the protocol is very old, non English languages don't exists and we need to make it easy to parse with a space delimited syntax
[20:13:20] <bookworm> welcome to the 90ies
[20:14:49] <xnaas> 1988
[20:14:53] <xnaas> we 80s bois
[20:15:21] <toro> oh yeah I’m an international keyboard/charset painfully aware
[20:15:39] <xnaas> But, all issues aside, at least you know IRC will probably be around for another 33 years ;P
[20:15:42] <toro> same people rope me in every few years as , flash or java or whatever they have been using, no longer works lol
[20:16:26] <toro> but I’m going to tweak thelounge to direct anonymous users to a public daemon and people who have a password. To a private daemon with bouncer feature
[20:16:46] <toro> for mobile people mostly
[20:17:12] <toro> otherwise they’re reconnecting every 3 minutes on kiwi
[20:17:14] <toro> Fun times
[20:17:21] <toro> Appreciate the help
[20:18:43] <toro> and yep xnaas can’t beat the operational cost heh
[20:18:43] <xnaas> You don't want to spin up a hugely complex solution with terrible clients?! (something something matrix/synapse) 😜
[20:19:11] <toro> Nah we have a telegram bridge no ones really using , we like the idea of alternate entry points
[20:19:41] <toro> But it’ll remain an irc backend for probably at least a few more years until someone comes up with a daemon that natively talks to all that crap by itself
[20:20:02] <toro> which I can see happening
[20:20:10] <xnaas> I suppose this is #thelounge-offtopic now, but: y'all usin' matterbridge?
[20:20:15] <toro> oops
[20:20:22] <toro> and no ty for the reminder
