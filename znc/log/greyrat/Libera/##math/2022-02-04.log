[03:14:55] <remii> I have the following series: https://i.imgur.com/AQHFLvr.png, would Taylor expansion be a first step to prove if this series converges or diverges?
[03:15:17] *** Joins: soapsudsxx (~soapsudsx@209.221.40.152)
[03:17:21] <isekaijin> remii: That probably doesn't help.
[03:17:53] <remii> Why not? Taylor expanding shows that  ln(k^2) + k^2 + O(k^4), where the partial sums don't tend to 0.
[03:18:16] <isekaijin> ln(k^2 + 1) - ln(k^2) = ln((k^2 + 1) / k^2) = ln(1 + 1/k^2)
[03:19:02] <remii> Yea damn it you are right. So Taylor expand ln(1 + 1/k^2) instead.
[03:19:14] <isekaijin> Why Taylor-expand?
[03:19:23] <isekaijin> What can you say about ln(1+x) and x for x > 0?
[03:19:39] <isekaijin> x > ln(1+x), right?
[03:20:07] <isekaijin> So ln(1 + 1/k^2) < 1/k^2
[03:20:28] <isekaijin> Your series is bounded above by sum_k 1/k^2, which is known to be convergent.
[03:21:56] <isekaijin> Of course, if you don't believe me, you can just plot y = ln(1+x), which is concave downward. This curve passes through the origin, and the tangent line at that point is y = x.
[03:22:04] <isekaijin> Since the curve is concave downward, the tangent line is above.
[03:22:10] <remii> Yea but that doesn't cut it for a proof of it.
[03:22:34] <isekaijin> Wait, what?
[03:23:07] <remii> I mean plotting it.
[03:23:11] <isekaijin> Oh.
[03:23:29] <isekaijin> But the fact that the curve y = ln(1 + x) is concave downward can be proved analytically, no plot required.
[03:23:39] <isekaijin> Using the sign of the second derivative.

[03:24:11] <isekaijin> I just said “plot” to appeal to your geometric intuition, but the proof that the curve is concave downward is very much rigorous.
[03:25:03] <remii> Why I want to Taylor expand it is because I can then compare it with an easier series (b_k) and use a theorem where if two series a_k, b_k > 0 for k->inf, and if lim k->inf (a_k/b_k) = A where 0 < A < inf, then a_k converges iff b_k converges.
[03:25:37] <isekaijin> Oh.
[03:27:33] <remii> We actually arrive at the same conclusion but I wanted to use this method to practice with the theorems we deduced, there are a few.
[03:28:25] <remii> I think so*
[03:28:41] <remii> Are you familiar with that theorem btw?
[03:28:47] <isekaijin> Sure.
[03:29:20] <isekaijin> Okay, so your a_k = ln(1 + 1/k^2) and your b_k = 1/k^2.
[03:29:35] <isekaijin> You're taking the limit as k -> inf.
[03:29:40] <remii> Wait, so I expand this one right?
[03:29:49] <isekaijin> But this is the same thing as taking the limit of ln(1 + x) / x when x -> 0.
[03:29:59] <remii> Not the original expression, where I would get log(k^2) + k^2 + O(k^4).
[03:30:00] <isekaijin> In other words, you're computing the derivative of ln(1 + x) at x = 0.
[03:31:38] <remii> isekaijin "In other words, you're computing the derivative of ln(1 + x) at x = 0." what do you mean? I mean I know what you mean but I'm a bit tired to see it.

[04:23:24] <deadmund> https://www.efunda.com/math/taylor_series/logarithmic.cfm

[04:24:04] <PlanckWalk> Where the a_n are baed on the n'th derivatives at c
[04:24:13] <PlanckWalk> based*
[04:24:49] <PlanckWalk> The top one is a Taylor series, the rest are based on Taylor series of transformations
[04:25:08] <deadmund> OH, I see.
[04:25:33] <PlanckWalk> Ah, I guess a few more are Taylor series too
[04:25:41] <PlanckWalk> Like the 3rd and 4th
[04:27:13] <PlanckWalk> But for e.g. the second, you need to transform to  u = (x-1)/(x+1)  and write  ln x  as a function of u, then take the taylor series of that.
[04:30:05] <PlanckWalk> u = (x-1)/(x+1) = 1 - 2/(x+1)  so that  ln(x) = ln((1+u)/(1-u)) = ln(1+u) - ln(1-u) from which getting a Taylor series is fairly easy.

[04:48:09] <deadmund> This is a strange question.... BUT, is there a way to compute or approximate log_b(x) with arbitrary base b and value x WITHOUT USING ANY EXPONENTIATION AT ALL?
[04:48:13] <deadmund> Strange question I know.
[04:48:50] <deadmund> The Taylor series uses many exponentiation operations (one in each term)
[04:50:59] *** Quits: slidercrank (~slidercra@user/slidercrank) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[04:51:33] <maroon> does dividing log(x) by log(b) count as exponentiation?
[04:53:51] <deadmund> Oh
[04:53:53] <deadmund> yeah
[04:54:00] <deadmund> haha, good point.  Thank you!
[04:56:01] <PlanckWalk> If you have some approximating polynomial  a0 + a1 x + a2 x^2 + ... + an x^n,  you can write it as  a0 + x(a1 + x(a2 + ...))
[04:56:14] <PlanckWalk> So then there's no exponentiation.

[05:03:06] <maroon> i have a question about the derangements problem, if my result is because the underlying formula ends up being the same formula as in the 'gets their own hat' problem
[05:03:12] *** Quits: deadmund (~quassel@155.68.54.74) (Remote host closed the connection)
[05:04:01] <maroon> if there are N people within N hats, if everyone is given a randomly chosen hat, the chance that nobody gets their own hat is 1/e
[05:04:41] *** Quits: newpy (~newpy@206.168.231.90) (Quit: Leaving)
[05:04:56] <maroon> however, that's a shuffling of the hats, rather than randomly giving a hat to someone without checking of they were given a hat already, and this also results in 1/e percentage of people who get no hat at all
[05:05:47] <maroon> ie, if you roll an N-side dice N-times, there will be 1/e proportion of the outcomes that will not happen, because some of the others will get rolled 2+ times
[05:06:57] *** Joins: jmdaemon (~jmdaemon@user/jmdaemon)
[05:06:58] <maroon> also, from random experimenation, it appears that, if i roll the N-sided nice N*k times, the proportion of dice outcomes that don't happen becomes (1/e)^k

[12:47:36] <Guest25> Hi all, I have a very basic understanding of maths, and mathematical symbols. I'm playing around with mathematic notation to help with my understanding. I was just wondering if someone could tell me if this statement is true. The sum of P = βA is equivalent to the sum of P = βɑG, is the same as mathematically expressing this as:
[12:47:36] <Guest25> https://i.imgur.com/zkNznvy.png ?
[12:51:47] <Guest25> When should the sum notation be used? I've probably used it with incorrect context here

[13:02:15] <Guest25> I suppose it then becomes ineffective in its usage
[13:02:18] <Guest25> without an index
[13:02:43] <Guest25> i.e. you wouldn't do sigma followed by 1+1
[13:02:52] <mh_le> without some context that statement is meaningless

[13:22:11] <ski> some might want to use short-circuiting boolean operations, which are well-defined, even if one operand isn't, as long as the other one "determines the answer" (by having an appropriate definite value). this might only be one-sided, or perhaps also two-sided
[13:22:52] <zeroc00l0> This has something to do with how you define the semantics for "OR"?
[13:24:01] <ski> a sortof related thing is to let the well-definedness of a conjunction and implication require the well-definedness of its right operand conditionally on the left operand being true. and similarly for disjunction, except conditionalizing on the left operand being false

[18:09:09] <remii> isekaijin Yea, basically on a high level I know how to approach this but would like some help with microsteps. There is again this theorem we used yesterday if you have two series a_k, b_k and the limit of a_k/b_k = A as k->\infty, where 0 < A < \infty, then a_k converges iff b_k converges.
[18:09:18] <isekaijin> remii: But your integral can be written as int_0^{pi} x^(4/3) csc(x)^2 dx. Maybe we can deal with the ranges 0-(pi/2) and (pi/2)-pi separately.
[18:09:22] <remii> But this is also for integrals now.
[18:09:33] <isekaijin> Oh, right.

[18:15:36] <isekaijin> We first change variables so that the interval of integration is -pi/2 to pi/2.
[18:19:16] <remii> isekaijin Hmm I wonder if we can't use the fact that sin(x) = x as x->0?
[18:19:24] <remii> Because then maybe we can replace 1/sin^2(x) with 1/x^2
[18:19:34] <remii> And prove that one part of the integral diverges
[18:20:11] <isekaijin> remii: http://mathb.in/70139
[18:21:12] <remii> I mean it works that way too but wouldn't it be simpler with the above?
[18:22:37] <isekaijin> Probably. Let me check.
[18:23:06] <isekaijin> No, wait. That doesn't work.
[18:23:32] <isekaijin> The problematic end is the upper endpoint of the interval of integration.
[18:23:39] <isekaijin> Analyzing near x = 0 doesn't give any useful results.
[18:24:00] <remii> How so?
[18:24:47] <isekaijin> Let me see.
[18:24:48] <remii> I understand that for example that the integral \int_{0}^{1} sinx/x is not problematic at 0.
[18:25:05] <isekaijin> 1/sin(x)^2 is larger than 1/x^2.
[18:25:28] <isekaijin> Near x = 0, the integrand is close to x^(4/3) / x^2 = x^(-2/3), okay.
[18:25:36] <riv> could this be related to the dirichlet integral?
[18:25:41] <isekaijin> So you're integrating x^(-2/3) on an interval [0,e] for some small e.
[18:26:02] <isekaijin> But this integral converges.
[18:26:30] <remii> I will tell you a secret, the integral diverges.
[18:26:31] <isekaijin> remii: The problems happen near x = pi.
[18:26:35] <isekaijin> I know.
[18:26:40] <remii> I know you know haha!
[18:26:42] <isekaijin> My mathb.in post shows that the integral diverges.
[18:27:01] <remii> Hm so near x=pi only?
[18:27:21] <isekaijin> From your approximation, I can't conclude anything near x = 0.
[18:27:32] <isekaijin> But my mathb.in post shows that there's a problem near x = pi.
[18:27:42] <isekaijin> Equivalently, for y very large.
[18:28:12] <isekaijin> Note that I've turned the integral from x = 0 to pi, into an integral from y = -inf to y = inf.
[18:28:16] <remii> So no information is given near x=0 because the above integral converges right
[18:28:21] <remii> Yep I saw it.
[18:28:25] <isekaijin> Should this integral converge, the integrand should become smaller when |y| is large.
[18:29:15] <isekaijin> The integrand does indeed become smaller for y -> -inf. (Not sufficient for convergence, but at least not sufficient for divergence.)
[18:29:25] <isekaijin> But it *doesn't* become smaller for y -> inf, hence the integral diverges.
[18:32:06] <remii> When you say the integrand becomes smaller/not, did you *evaluate* the series?
[18:32:14] <remii> Since the integral is an upper bound for the series?
[18:32:25] <isekaijin> Wait, I never saw any series.
[18:32:43] <isekaijin> I only saw an integral, and thought that was the problem we were trying to solve.
[18:32:46] <isekaijin> What is your original series?
[18:33:26] <remii> No this is it, but I mean you could check the series for divergence if the integral is an upper bound.
[18:33:33] <remii> If this was the case.

[19:27:43] <int-e> Simplar: if there are a x b rectangles (your example has a = b = 5) then the answer is a + b - 1.

[23:48:33] <tom__> Are they surjective by definition of what an equivalence class is?
[23:48:44] <johnkeats6> yes
[23:49:00] <tom__> cheers
[23:49:33] <ski> often, it can be nice to just introduce a quotient directly ("user-defined equality"), rather than pondering how to construct/represent/implement it (in terms of equivalence classes, or perhaps in some other way, maybe by normalizing)
[23:51:01] <ski> iow, you define ⌜X ∕ ∼⌝ and ⌜q : X ⟶ X ∕ ∼⌝ directly, by stating that
[23:51:57] <ski>   q(x₀) = q(x₁)  ⇔  x₀ ∼ x₁    (∀ x₀,x₁ ∈ X)
[23:52:47] <Z-module> tom__: yes, by construction, you could say.
[23:53:17] <Z-module> For every x in X, the class [x] definitely exists -- it has at least x in it, even if nothing else.
[23:53:55] <tom__> Thanks Z-module
[23:54:00] <ski> (after having made sure that ⌜∼⌝ is an equivalence relation. alternatively, pick any binary relation ⌜R⌝ on ⌜X⌝ whatsoever, and make the inductive specification ⌜q(x₀) = q(x₁)  ⇐  x₀ R x₁    (∀ x₀,x₁ ∈ X)⌝. this amounts to using as equivalence relation the reflexive-symmetric-transitive closure of ⌜R⌝ (least equivalence relation containing ⌜R⌝))

[23:55:07] <ski> tom__ : yes, an equivalence class can't be empty
[23:55:18] <tom__> ski: Interesting
[23:57:59] <tom__> So to be more rigorous q is surjective because for all elements in our image the same element must be in the preimate (reflexivity)?
[23:58:02] <tom__> *preimage
[23:58:11] <ski> (the "definition" of ⌜q⌝ doesn't actually define what the values of ⌜q⌝ is. we know one can do that (in set theory), but we needn't bother with it, just like we normally don't bother about what a pair ⌜(a,b)⌝ "really is". what matters is that two tuples are equal exactly when their respective components are equal, and that two elements of the quotient are equal precisely when any two representants
[23:58:17] <ski> of them are related by the equivalence relation)
[23:58:57] <ski> tom__ : not quite the same element, but an element that "generates" the one in the image
