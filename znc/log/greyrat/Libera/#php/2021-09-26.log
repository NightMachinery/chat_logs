[04:20:47] <Byteflux> I'd just recommend having a single entry point (index.php) as your front controller / router. Routes are a concept specific to your application, so it makes sense that your application handles the routing.
[04:20:59] <Byteflux> WishBoy: That way your application's routing is decoupled from your web server.
[04:22:18] <Blondie101010> the complexity level of both is comparable
[04:22:50] <Blondie101010> having a single point of entry is a good design, but not the only acceptable solution
[04:27:21] <Blondie101010> and with httpd rewrites, you can do a lot
[04:28:16] <Byteflux> Of course, you can do it, but it comes at a cost for very little gain.
[04:28:30] <Byteflux> You create a tight coupling between your application and httpd for no practical gain.

[04:29:38] <Byteflux> Of course what TML is talking about is not rewrites in httpd though, as he mentioned file resolution.
[04:31:04] <Byteflux> Where in that context "routing" is simply resolving a request path to a PHP file

[04:36:36] * Blondie101010 nods
[04:36:54] <Blondie101010> but you can combine both
[04:38:24] <Blondie101010> like https://mysite.com/user/profile/edit opens $webroot/user/profile/index.php?op=edit
[04:40:21] <Byteflux> Right, but that's only really comparable if you have a single rewrite rule that handles every possible application route.
[04:40:52] <Byteflux> If you have to define multiple rewrites, you're just adding complexity that creates a tight dependency on your web server's rewriting capabilities, where you could simply be handling with your application instead.
[04:40:57] <Byteflux> (by having a single entry point)
[04:41:05] <Blondie101010> sure
[04:41:39] <Byteflux> I don't think there's much to gain by using your web server's rewriting capabilities vs handling the "rewrites" in PHP
[04:42:03] <Blondie101010> that's a detail
[04:42:13] <Blondie101010> the difference is in your PHP project structure
[04:42:29] <Blondie101010> some modular designs make a lot of sense

[07:27:27] <TML> Blondie101010, Byteflux: Well, you also have to realize that when I design PHP applications, I generally would not try to do that kind of "magic"; why bother with logic to change '/profile/edit.php' to '/profile/index.php?op=edit', regardless of whether you're doing it "in the router" or "in the httpd"? Just let the URL be '/profile/index.php?op=edit'
[07:28:05] <TML> I reject the entire philosophy of extension-less and parameter-less URLs as misguided nonsense.
[07:28:33] <Blondie101010> :)
[07:31:48] <TML> not to say I wouldn't ever use rewrites in an httpd, but it's generally something I reserve for things like "cool URLs don't change"
[07:36:34] <TML> I also don't really hesitate too much to "tightly bind PHP behaviour to that of my httpd", because I've been using Apache httpd since 0.9.6 and have zero intention to ever change httpds.
[07:36:39] <TML> But YMMV there

[18:45:50] <NCS_One> can I convert a string like, `01` to a int with filter_var()?
[18:47:01] <da_wunder> I would use something like this - https://3v4l.org/S0UlW
[18:50:16] <NCS_One> is this recommended over intval()?
[18:50:50] <da_wunder> you mean (int)$foo vs. intval($foo) ?
[18:52:56] <NCS_One> I mean (int)ltrim('01', '0') vs intval('01')

[19:55:43] <__adrian> yes
[19:56:45] <__adrian> but with casting, you have no way of knowing whether or not normalization found a valid value
[19:56:58] <__adrian> `0` and `pigs` give the same result
[19:57:23] <white5moke> Php casting? For real?
[19:57:33] <white5moke> Is it a thing now?
[19:57:47] <__adrian> ?
[19:58:12] <__adrian> type casting has been a thing... forever
[19:58:31] <white5moke> Besides the limited casting that existed in php for years
[19:58:46] <Blondie101010> what?
[19:58:55] <white5moke> In php?
[19:59:16] <Blondie101010> casting is a simple concept that's always exists afaik
[19:59:24] <white5moke> Yes I know
[19:59:46] <white5moke> Specific to php tho?
[20:00:00] <__adrian> white5moke: it's not clear what you're asking
[20:00:07] <__adrian> yes, we're talking about php.
[20:00:27] <Blondie101010> I think he suspects type casting to be a new thing in PHP
[20:00:35] <Blondie101010> I know it was there in 4.x
[20:00:38] <__adrian> typecasting has beena round forever, and hasn't changed much
[20:00:43] <white5moke> It newer right?
[20:00:45] <__adrian> no
[20:00:49] <__adrian> it's very old
[20:01:01] <white5moke> About how old?
[20:01:28] <white5moke> Specific to php only
[20:01:30] <Byteflux> Pretty much since the beginning
[20:01:33] <Byteflux> PHP has had type casting
[20:01:41] <__adrian> i've said "forever" a few times. i couldn't attest to how accessible it was earlier than php 3, but at least that
[20:01:50] <Byteflux> Basically 20+ years.
[20:02:09] <white5moke> It sucked before even latest version
[20:02:29] <Blondie101010> white5moke:  type juggling does not remove the need of casting...  it's almost the contrary
[20:02:30] <__adrian> again, hasn't changed substantially
[20:02:59] <__adrian> type juggling IS type casting. it's just the part where php does it automatically.
[20:03:25] <white5moke> Idk I have yet to see php really push the casting envelope would make debugging easier and code would be less busy and convoluted
[20:03:36] <Blondie101010> my point being that juggling sometimes justifies manual casting
[20:03:58] <white5moke> I like the "contract" made when casting
[20:04:01] <__adrian> again, i don't know what you're expecting/asking about, but it's not changed substantially and it likely never will.
[20:04:43] <__adrian> there's no contract aside from "now it's that type, but maybe you completely screwed the value."
[20:04:58] *** Parts: zibby15 (~androirc@user/zibby15) (AndroIRC)
[20:05:00] <white5moke> One thing I abhor about most languages is having to guess what I'm receiving and what I'm sending as far as objects and hard vars
[20:05:22] <__adrian> sounds like maybe you're thiking of type _hinting_, then.
[20:05:38] <__adrian> brb
[20:05:44] <white5moke> Interpretation is for poets and writers lol
[20:06:05] <Byteflux> No, it's for people who want other people to understand what they are talking about.
[20:06:14] <Byteflux> Use the right words otherwise you end up confusing people.
[20:06:40] <white5moke> But computers do not abide by your language
[20:06:42] <Byteflux> Type casting and hinting are two completely different things.
[20:06:55] <white5moke> They abide by direct instructions
[20:07:08] <Rockwood_> __adrian, hi how are you sir?
[20:08:04] <Byteflux> Casting and hinting are both well known concepts that have well established understandings that are unrelated to each other. They are also fairly basic concepts so you shouldn't be getting them confused.
[20:12:51] <Byteflux> I guess you could say they are related if you make the connection between type declarations/hinting and type coercion/juggling.
[20:16:39] <Blondie101010> enforcing the type before the actual validation could be part of the actual input specs
[20:17:45] <__adrian> ^
[20:17:57] <__adrian> hinting also knows whether the value changes as a result of casting.
[20:18:05] <__adrian> (and fails if it does)
