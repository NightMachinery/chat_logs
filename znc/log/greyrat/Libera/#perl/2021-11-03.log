[01:18:28] <mst> lower decks is hilarious

[01:19:19] <mst> Grinnz: DISC S1 had its moments but didn't set things up quite right, S2 was as much as anything else 'changing stuff around to have a better starting point', but I thought S3 - and especially the last few episodes - were very trek

[01:32:45] <keir> i have never been able to bring myself to watch Lower Decks
[01:33:09] <keir> the realism and magic is lost when it's animated
[01:33:21] <daemon> rbraun, both the original series and nextgen (and even voyager) was exceptionally written with people acting how they would in a role of their kind ... not some action packed almost fps based thing that it now has become
[01:33:45] <daemon> keir, I can deal with lower deck more because it is animated, its not really star trek
[01:33:49] <rbraun> ah, they superhero'ed it up :/
[01:33:51] <daemon> its a fun little offspring
[01:34:18] <daemon> however discover and picard seem well yeah ... offensive to their origin

[01:36:28] <keir> the fact they're limited to Netflix and Prime miffs me a little as well

[01:37:06] <daemon> that is kinda the thing ...
[01:37:17] <daemon> they are absolute trash compared to what their basis is imo
[01:37:36] <daemon> but well ... that is where we are now days
[01:38:05] <keir> i do say shows today aren't written like they were back then
[01:38:08] <daemon> writing by children and all, plots and plans must be resolved in minutes or the audience may not be able to understand them
[01:38:24] <keir> dialogue and narrative was always so well crafted
[01:39:03] <daemon> its almost like computer software as well, games used to be trim and optimized; now they required 8G of memory; there is no narrative
[01:39:10] <daemon> no real writing skill
[01:39:12] <daemon> but it looks pretty!
[01:39:33] <keir> well in fairness, star trek has always been episodic. there are some story arcs, but you don't need to know them to follow a single episode
[01:40:01] * daemon points to the character development in voyager
[01:41:03] <ether> or lack thereof
[01:41:03] <daemon> all of the old star trek stories had development of some kind, some in an easter egg format where viewers who was hardcore and watched a long spotting things
[01:41:19] <keir> garak for instance
[01:41:38] <ether> what do we know about Harry Kim, except that he has parents who love him, he used to have a girlfriend on Earth, and he plays the clarinet? nothing. he couldn't even get promoted to Lieutenant.
[01:42:05] <daemon> ether, but you know something ... compare that to the modern variants
[01:43:11] <daemon> the holographic doctor, work, picard, ... the list is enourmous and so is the history
[01:43:31] <daemon> I meant worf not work - god I am old >.<
[01:45:43] <daemon> there is massive character development from say ~~ the 1985+ to say 2005 in all medias
[01:46:13] <daemon> then it all seems to have just ended. all the good writers died

[06:00:49] <aquanight> I feel like it would be very difficult to saturate 40,000 mbit in any realistic application
[06:01:04] <daemon> well not the idea is thatyou have your server connected to a switch at a super high rate

[06:02:09] <daemon> you easily can when editing something like 12 or 8k footage over network storage
[06:02:48] <aquanight> like even if you're talking about handling 40 Gbit *inbound* I really think you're going to get choked by non-network HW 
[06:03:04] <daemon> well that is why things like epyc exist
[06:03:25] <daemon> if you went gen 4. pci x16 ... how much speed you talking ... one mo
[06:03:42] <daemon> '256 Gbps of bandwidth per card'
[06:05:14] <daemon> so you might have one beefy server capable of that doing lots of video processing or other such thing stepped down thought multiple switches to deal with lots of lower end clients
[06:05:17] <aquanight> if you have to do any kind of CPU-bound work that bit rate is going to be choked *hard*

[06:08:32] <aquanight> I'm pretty sure we're pushing speed of light limits as it is.
[06:08:47] <xenu> epyc cpus are basically *much* lower clocked threadrippers
[06:08:51] <aquanight> gonna have to do some star-trek-esque "dip half the CPU into hyperspace" or something.
[06:09:22] <daemon> its going to end up with thousands of cores that all have individual power control i.e. being able to be totally turned off
[06:09:27] <daemon> we are indeed hitting the limit
[06:10:12] <daemon> so the next step will be back to SMP land, where different physical cpu's can share caches but with faster cross-talk and transfer
[06:10:36] <aquanight> picturing a massive board that is just a grid of these CPUs
[06:11:08] <aquanight> hauls multiple petabits per second and somehow it doesn't set itself on fire in 2.4 seconds
[06:11:48] <aquanight> one of the CPUs is a sacrificial CPU that has heated itself so much it's hit "absolute hot" and is now absorbing all the heat from the other CPUs or something stupid like that

[06:36:22] <simcop2387> Grinnz, cat7 basically never happened.  It exists but it's useless.  More expensive than cat6a and not any better for it.  Cat8 is rated for an rf bandwidth of 2ghz, and etherenet up to 40gbps.  Cat7 can only do 10gbps, like cat6a, and only at the same distances of cat6a
[06:38:48] *** Joins: G_SabinoMullane (~G_SabinoM@pool-72-94-251-236.phlapa.fios.verizon.net)
[06:38:50] <simcop2387> Cat7 started before cat6a happened but then cat6a was easier and cheaper to manufacture (I think it came from manufacturers) since it was the same as cat6 but with a cheap plastic spacer.
[06:43:13] <Grinnz> so cat 7 is php 6
[06:43:48] <mst> LOL
[06:43:55] <simcop2387> Pretty much
[06:44:59] <simcop2387> If cat7 supported 25gbps it'd have a purpose but it doesn't.  As soon as you want more than 10gbps you habe to go cat8, twinax, or fiber

[19:00:35] <daemon> +x sets the file chmod to executable when combined with the shebang line
[19:00:39] <daemon> weather a .sh or .pl or w/e
[19:00:52] <daemon> it basically says ./ -> Do what the shebang says because this can be executed by something else
[19:00:58] <daemon> meanwhile perl <PATH>
[19:01:09] <daemon> is you calling a binary and then giving it a path for a file to read
[19:02:19] <Botje> pffrt. don't you run all your programs via /lib/ld.so?
[19:02:32] <Altreus> none of that really alters xenu's point
[19:03:18] <Altreus> a file is either intended to be executed or it is not - that's not a permissions thing
[19:03:47] <El_Che> when you decide who can execute it, it may be
[19:03:49] <Altreus> Seems strange to suggest that someone might be allowed to read or write it, but never run it
[19:04:15] <Altreus> you can read this script but you may not run it!
[19:04:27] <Altreus> but you can run perl and give it the script but shush
[19:04:47] <Altreus> and if you can read it you can copy it, +x that, and run it anyway
[19:05:15] <Altreus> seems to me that "can run it" and "can read it" are the same thing, conceptually, but that's not how it's implemented
[19:05:23] <Botje> Altreus: now assume I can trick a server of yours into accepting an uploaded root exploit and running it
[19:05:44] <Botje> with separate +r and +x (or an equivalent noexec mount) you can at least block that

[19:11:50] <Altreus> I've covered that
[19:12:07] <Altreus> I want to know when I would want a user to be able to see the other users in /home, but not be able to cd /home
[19:12:22] <Altreus> what good does it do to not be able to set your cwd to a dir?
[19:12:40] <El_Che> it's not about cd'ing to /home but to /home/$USER
[19:12:48] <Altreus> I don't follow
[19:12:58] <furrymcgee> let him cd into /home/user at least
[19:12:59] <Altreus> why would denying access to /home also deny access to /home/$USER
[19:13:16] <Altreus> that's literally how it already works, and would continue to work if the x bit went away
[19:13:44] <El_Che> you are giving access to listing
[19:13:50] <El_Che> so more than now
[19:13:55] <Altreus> I know
[19:13:58] <Altreus> I'm asking why, not what
[19:14:11] <Altreus> WHY is it useful to ls /home but not cd /home ?
[19:14:16] <Altreus> I've asked three times now
[19:14:28] <Altreus> what is the point in preventing cd ever?
[19:14:45] <El_Che> get a list of users, see which homes are wide open
[19:15:02] <Altreus> sounds like a security issue to let someone see which users have home dirs
[19:15:18] <Altreus> But it does not sound like a security issue to let a process's cwd be in a dir they can't do shit with anyway
[19:15:27] <Altreus> so again, why are they separate
[19:16:09] <furrymcgee> yes it maybe useful to cd /home/user an not ls /home
[19:16:16] <Altreus> that wasn't the question
[19:16:26] <Altreus> The question was why prevent cd /home and not ls /home
[19:16:36] <Altreus> not /home/user, that's a separate permission
[19:17:00] <Altreus> it already works that way, after all
[19:17:44] <Altreus> I've not seen a convincing reason why the read bit should not also control execute, although Botje hinted at one but I didn't understand it
[19:20:15] *** Joins: pucara (~i@181.92.84.206)
[19:24:37] <furrymcgee> cd might be a security risk by itself
[19:25:07] <furrymcgee> see rbash
[19:25:46] <Altreus> Sounds like you agree with the opinion then
[19:26:20] <furrymcgee> opinion or question
[19:26:55] <Altreus> The opinion is that exec is a feature of the file (or directory or whatever) and not a permissions concern
[19:27:22] <Altreus> and the +x bit doesn't offer anything over +r and making +x a feature of the file rather than the filesystem
[19:30:17] <daemon> you could create a file and disallow it to be executed but still read if you considered it dodgy
[19:30:23] <daemon> or something someone emailed you
[19:30:31] <daemon> +r-w-x
[19:31:11] <Altreus> I guess you could get in a situation where you executed something that would then execute this
[19:31:15] <daemon> or you could make a file executable only by the person who owns it everyone else can only read it
[19:31:19] <daemon> 544
[19:31:28] <Altreus> Or if you're in the habit of double-clicking files to open them and suddenly this one runs instead
[19:31:34] <daemon> or maybe the group can execute, the owner can edit, everyone else can read
[19:31:36] <Altreus> no I covered that
[19:31:38] <daemon> chmod 754
[19:31:44] <Altreus> If it's readable you can copy it and +x it and then run it anyway
[19:31:56] <Altreus> or you can just run the interpreter with the file, if it's perl or whatever
[19:32:08] <daemon> maybe if its an example that is what you want
[19:32:16] <El_Che> maybe it's setuid?
[19:32:17] <daemon> if you want this take it yourself to your own home dir and play with it
[19:32:17] <Altreus> seems useless
[19:32:28] <Altreus> I can understand preventing accidental execution
[19:32:44] <Altreus> Especially if you're in the habit of taking apart malicious code
[19:32:58] <Altreus> But I'd very much expect people who work with malicious code to be smart about the environment in which they view it
[19:33:40] <Altreus> anyway i'm convinced there's probably a good reason that can't be solved any other way
[19:34:16] <Altreus> then again if you can chmod -x then in the other universe you'd just setmeta -x
[19:34:45] <Altreus> anyway :P

[23:29:37] <xenu> ideal trim() should follow all the good builtin practices
[23:30:18] <xenu> 1) its return value should be useless and context sensitive, in scalar context it should return boolean indicating a success, in list context it should return a list of original untrimmed strings
[23:31:03] <xenu> 2) when a list is passed to trim, it should lefttrim the first argument and righttrim the last one
