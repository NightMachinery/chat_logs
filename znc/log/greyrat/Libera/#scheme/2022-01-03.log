[02:03:54] <tatsumaru> just saw a video on computerphile about finite state automata, aka machines without memory. the example given was a vending machine. for some reason i felt appreciative that you can build a computer without memory.
[02:05:35] <sonny> you can't
[02:06:18] <tatsumaru> why not?
[02:07:54] <sonny> well, I dunno how to make one without registers
[02:08:01] <sonny> sorry for my terrible answer
[02:09:24] <tatsumaru> well I am not sure a vending machine has registers. it's just a mechanical computer that changes state, but isn't capable of tracing back.
[02:10:05] <sonny> yeah, it doesn't
[02:10:22] <sonny> when you say computer, I think of something specific
[02:10:56] <sonny> and it's not just something made with finite state elements
[02:10:57] <mdhughes> I'm sure almost any vending machine made this century has a microcontroller and some RAM.
[02:11:17] <sonny> yeah, they have digital displays
[02:11:24] <sonny> but I'm just going with the example
[02:11:30] *** Quits: zap1 (~zap@gateway/tor-sasl/zap) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[02:11:43] <tatsumaru> mdhughes: yeah most likely, but the point is you can build the core functionality without microchips
[02:12:12] <sonny> sure
[02:12:26] <sonny> but what's the point, computers are cost effect and dirt cheap
[02:12:46] <tatsumaru> no point, I just like extremely simple things that aren't completely useless
[02:13:41] <sonny> I mean, I guess you could just make do with some sr latches I guess
[02:14:07] <sonny> but that's probably more expensive :P
[02:14:10] <tatsumaru> i guess from my point of view, even an abacus is a computer
[02:14:10] <mdhughes> Some of it, you only need a sensor to light up when something's out. Change is probably too hard to do mechanically with different prices, bills. Credit cards require a computer.
[02:14:36] <sonny> oh right, they do use cards now
[02:14:56] <sonny> tatsumaru so any automaton?
[02:15:14] <sonny> even a light switch?
[02:16:35] <tatsumaru> hmm have to think about this, if it can only do one operation, not sure it qualifies, maybe two light switches though
[02:18:58] <tatsumaru> i take that back, you are right, just remembered morse code
[02:20:21] <tatsumaru> although in the case of morsecode the computer is the brain, so maybe i didn't think this very well through
[02:20:35] <sonny> automata is very useful, my frontend will be two machines

[02:22:38] <sonny> monad is such a scary word
[02:22:40] <Zipheir> Formatting combinators are very powerful, and they compose better than magic format strings.
[02:23:01] <sonny> the srfi's are really impressive
[02:23:09] <tatsumaru> sonny are you writing a scheme
[02:23:26] <sonny> no, just oberon subset compiler for now
[02:23:45] <sonny> what do srfi's require? just a scheme with a standard?
[02:23:54] <sonny> it'd be nice to get all that code for free :P
[02:25:25] <Zipheir> sonny: The implementations are usually portable.
[02:25:48] <sonny> ok great
[02:26:17] <Zipheir> CHICKEN and chibi already have SRFI 166, so it definitely works in practice.
[02:26:34] <Zipheir> Well, it's called 'fmt' in chicken.
