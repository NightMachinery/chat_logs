[02:13:15] <lz_> Xenoprimate: I started working on these very early, I was even still at school. Then put them aside to do some "real" work. One day a friend told me that if I wanted to accomplish anything in life, I'd have to start then or never, so I got back to work
[02:13:36] <Xenoprimate> I did give it all up once and tried to get in to gamedev
[02:13:42] <Xenoprimate> I made a game engine and a game, and published it on Steam
[02:13:45] <Xenoprimate> Took me 2.5 years
[02:13:48] <Xenoprimate> Got like, 100 downloads max

[02:24:45] <Xenoprimate> I agree wholly about that lz_, something still has value even if it's not commercially successful
[02:25:04] <Xenoprimate> Otherwise we all have to agree that Justin Bieber is more valuable than most other music
[02:28:16] <lz_> or that ugly teddy bear we had as kids. It was ugly but it was ours
[02:32:46] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate what kinda music?
[02:33:33] <Xenoprimate> Kind of prog metal/rock ish?
[02:34:08] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate sounds pretty cool. What kinda setup you got (assuming home setup for all recording/mixing/mastering)
[02:34:51] <Xenoprimate> Yeah home setup. Cubase. Roli LUMI for keyboard inputs. Got an 8-string guitar for recording guitar parts. And a Slate modelling mic for recording vocals
[02:35:11] <Xenoprimate> Nothing too special in any of it but it's enough for a hobbyist ^^
[02:35:22] <JakeSays> lz_: sometimes just shipping is enough to be proud of
[02:36:15] <JakeSays> lol my house is filled with shit that i've built and am proud of but has no commercial value
[02:37:25] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate Roli's are expensive!!
[02:37:45] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate what do you do for drums, etc. bass?
[02:38:06] <Xenoprimate> Yes they are _genuser_ ! Hahaha. But, well... I can't really play piano/keyboard, so having a controller where the right keys for a given scale/mode light up is a god-send xD
[02:38:36] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate keyboards are easy once you can visual keys.
[02:38:38] <Xenoprimate> Drums I use Superior Drummer 3; bass I use my 8-string (it's tuned to drop E, and I can downtune further with a pedal if I need) or just synths for synthy bass stuff
[02:39:32] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate ok, so the way to visual keys is - you play the melody and notice which keys are being used. first two of the 3 black keys? then immediately down to white keys? etc. etc. Then just make up chords only using those keys. It's an amazing shortcut. Can't do that on a guitar. lol.
[02:40:53] <Lukky> Ahh.. lumi... I'm looking into a NI Komplete Kontrol...
[02:40:56] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate nice. I haven't upgrade from ezdrummer. I bought Addictive Drums too. Sometimes I like this sound and sometimes that other one.
[02:41:28] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate but I noticed the ezdrummer only has like 2 crashes available and such and such. The superior probably has a lot more. crymbals/crashes/toms
[02:41:44] <Xenoprimate> _genuser_ that way of thinking gets in the way for me personally. I think of stuff very much in terms of the intervals (so major is WWHWWWH)... The idea of 'black keys' really pisses me off xD We don't have black frets hahaha
[02:42:19] <Xenoprimate> Lukky I was gonna get an NI keyboard for aaaages but then at the last minute I went Roli... I think in the end I didn't wanna be so strongly tied in to the NI environment
[02:42:44] <Xenoprimate> _genuser_ yeah SD3 is amazing but expensive. Also the samples take up a huge amount of space so you need a decent hard drive haha
[02:43:02] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate so the whole concept of visualizing which keys are you using to play the melody that you are working on is to figure out which keys are used for chord making. You can ignore it as black/white keys.
[02:43:22] <lz_> I'll need music for my game at some point :P
[02:43:26] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate I learned to play the keys by ear. I can play most simple melodies. And you know the Final Countdown riff. lol.
[02:43:50] <Lukky> I have an old Roland keyboard... it's like 12 years old :-)
[02:43:55] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate I also bought a Dean bass on sale for $99. hehe. Pretty cool. Plug is in and then try to re-amp it after recording clean.
[02:43:59] <_genuser_> or add a slight dist.
[02:44:40] <lz_> I remember the day I realized VSTs were super expensive too and making music would cost a shit ton of money as well
[02:45:29] <Xenoprimate> Yeah I always re-amp
[02:45:33] <lz_> maybe I'll end up making VSTs :D just kidding. unless? lol jk.     unless
[02:45:35] <Xenoprimate> I live purely in the digital world :D
[02:45:47] <Xenoprimate> I use amp sims
[02:46:14] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate what you using now?
[02:46:27] <Xenoprimate> >.> Don't judge me
[02:46:29] <Xenoprimate> I have an AxeFX
[02:46:30] <Xenoprimate> :D
[02:46:51] <_genuser_> not familiar. let me google.
[02:47:19] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate I've been using Poulin by Lepou (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L8iXXl9dpE)
[02:47:30] <_genuser_> although, my sounds never come out as great as those.
[02:47:54] <Xenoprimate> I used software VST ampsims for a long time
[02:47:59] <Xenoprimate> But I couldn't hack the latency
[02:48:05] <Xenoprimate> So that's why I bought the axefx
[02:48:09] <_genuser_> I've also downloaded a bunch of IRs overtime and I tend to just find the first amp plugin and IR cabinet and load up an IR and just off I go with playing.
[02:48:26] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate so axe fx is a stand alone thingie?
[02:48:31] <Xenoprimate> I have some IRs from Periphery if you know them
[02:48:53] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate dangit, made me click on this: https://www.ace-fx.com/
[02:49:08] <Xenoprimate> Yeah _genuser_, it's a dedicated rack unit (though mine just sits on my desk) with dedicated DSP cards and it processes your audio within like, 3ms
[02:49:11] <Xenoprimate> Haha, here: https://www.fractalaudio.com/iii/
[02:49:39] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate I know of periphery and their sounds is awesome. I tend to not really listen to most of the bands like that. Mostly because they have a whole concept album idea and there's a whole drawn out netherworld story going on in most of those songs. I find that style of album'ing quite old.
[02:50:04] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate I could be wrong. Just the whole idea of creating dark worlds and singing about them is just kinda cliche now. imo. imho.
[02:50:13] <Xenoprimate> Haha yeah that's my feel on Periphery too. I don't really like their music that much. But their sound is tiiight
[02:50:49] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate freakin' awesome that axe fx. I was considering the line6 pod or helix stuff for a while.
[02:51:43] <_genuser_> Xenoprimate I play no where near 1/100th the ability of some of these metal guitarists that made all this stuff sound good. I just want the best sound making gadget. So IF I ever practiced a riff really fast really long really clean that I have a nice sounding track.
[02:52:12] <Xenoprimate> Oh yeah, the line6 stuff is kind of the same idea the axefx
[02:52:37] <Xenoprimate> And same man, it's just a hobby. I'm not a full-time musician and I can't practice 8 hours a day as much as I'd love to
[02:52:47] <Xenoprimate> But give me enough takes to record something and comp it all together and it can sound fine
[02:52:53] <Xenoprimate> I'm more in to writing than playing anyway x3

[02:56:01] <_genuser_> on youtube. He uses kemper powerhead. And I figure maybe just spend 2.5k and just get one of those.
[02:59:02] <Xenoprimate> Kemper is basically a direct competitor/alternative to AxeFX
[02:59:19] <Xenoprimate> AxeFX tends to be used more in rock/metal scenes, Kemper for other genres
[02:59:31] <_genuser_> hehe I just saw the price. I can totally see them being competitors.
[02:59:59] <_genuser_> I like the sound this guys gets for most of his songs. So I figured Kemper might be nice .https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0RV0kgdqJU
[03:00:18] <_genuser_> I might youtube some Axe-fx demos actually.
[03:00:25] <Xenoprimate> Yeah to be honest you can't really go wrong with either device
[03:00:56] <_genuser_> haha, paying 2.5k, you better get something that makes a good sound!
[03:01:11] <Xenoprimate> I picked the AxeFX because it has modelling rather than just profiling; plus I think the software support is better
[03:01:59] <Xenoprimate> (It also has more effects but I don't really care about those)
[03:02:39] <_genuser_> half the time, I'm doing electronic stuff. edm, elctro, trance etc. etc. Half the time guitar based stuff. With that much distraction it's hard to get good at anything, lol.
[03:02:59] <_genuser_> last time I picked up the guitar was to record a funny song for my niece.
[03:03:34] <_genuser_> I didn't think I could still pay music. But apparently the simple stuff is hard to forget.
[03:08:08] <Xenoprimate> Yeah you gotta focus haha
[03:08:23] <Xenoprimate> I guess you probably wouldn't wanna spend $2.5k on a processor unless you're dedicated
[03:08:46] <_genuser_> or have that much disposable income for a toy.
[03:09:05] <_genuser_> I do think if I had the right tone, I might even release a whole album.
[03:09:14] <_genuser_> but realistically, who makes "albums" anymore.
[03:09:28] <_genuser_> just master on your home computer and release to itunes.
[03:10:16] <Xenoprimate> Yeah album is a big ask of yourself tbh
[03:10:21] <Xenoprimate> All that work for 3 downloads x3
[03:10:40] <Xenoprimate> I'll post my first single here when it's done though! I'm working on it ^^
[03:10:48] <_genuser_> hehe. marketing is a big problem with music.
[03:10:53] <Xenoprimate> (I've recorded stuff before but it wasn't good enough to release properly really)
[03:11:08] <_genuser_> even hard working bands doing the bar scene barely make a name.
[03:11:31] <_genuser_> yeah guitar wise, I think there's few things I'd play for others. Electronic stuff, I have some confidence in having uploaded it online.
[03:21:27] <Xenoprimate> Yeah my brother's in a proper band, they've been gigging for years and only just starting to get a little further with it

[05:49:12] <khanred> old man look at my life
[05:49:14] <JakeSays> _genuser_: i don't get your point
[05:49:22] <_genuser_> khanred thankfully, doing fine. just started up my android app again and started making modifications to add new functionality. Didn't realize how much I had forgotten about it.
[05:49:39] <khanred> That's cool. What does the app do?
[05:49:53] <_genuser_> JakeSays hehe, I was just jokingly comparing niel to britney spears. (one is an icon, the other is ... also an icon of lip syncing world)
[05:50:32] <_genuser_> though I can't say that I"ve heard any neil young usic. Just that I've heard people hold him in high regard.
[05:51:57] <_genuser_> khanred stores data as encrypted on the device. Mostly your notes. But I'm adding functionality so that if the top line says passwords\n then it changes the editor to a listview and shows any line marked with p: <value> as all asterisks and allows a view/copy option.
[05:52:11] <_genuser_> that ways if you open it in a place where others can see it, they can't see your passwords.
[05:52:24] <khanred> hm
[05:52:49] <_genuser_> I would have liked to store the passwords note file in a json format, much easier to parse and to mark passwords. But for now this will do.
[05:52:57] <JakeSays> _genuser_: lol looking for passowrds\n is a hack
[05:52:59] <_genuser_> then maybe next version will add proper formatting.
[05:53:18] <ravindUwU> hey, if you type in your pw, it will show as stars
[05:53:21] <ravindUwU> ********* see!
[05:53:28] * khanred rolls eyes
[05:53:58] <Xenoprimate> let me try it
[05:54:01] <Xenoprimate> oldjokesareold
[05:54:04] <Xenoprimate> did it work
[05:54:13] <JakeSays> it did. i see sars
[05:54:17] <_genuser_> JakeSays true that. the original safety comes from the file being aes256 encrypted. Looking to move to 512. But once you supply the correct password, I'd rather keep the UI still obfuscated.
[05:54:25] <khanred> my password is actually *********
[05:54:50] <JakeSays> _genuser_: i mean using the first line of a text file to determine file type
[05:55:09] <khanred> would it be better to use the second line?
[05:55:14] <_genuser_> JakeSays yep, I just didn't see a faster way. heh.
[05:55:17] <ravindUwU> <Xenoprimate> **************
[05:55:18] <ravindUwU> thats what I see
[05:55:23] <JakeSays> khanred: random line.
[05:55:40] <khanred> brilliant
[05:55:42] <_genuser_> JakeSays although, I did consider the whole json bit. where you might have a { datatype: 'passwords', data: [] } or somesuch.
[05:55:56] <JakeSays> well, i wouldn't use json either.
[05:56:09] <JakeSays> but then i'm an anti-jsonite
[05:56:18] <khanred> some sort of binary file format?
[05:56:19] <_genuser_> JakeSays well don't make us guess, what would you use?
[05:56:27] <JakeSays> khanred: yes
[05:56:39] <JakeSays> _genuser_: probably a sqlite database
[05:56:49] <JakeSays> or roll my own file format
[05:56:54] <_genuser_> JakeSays then you'd encrypt the db file?
[05:57:11] <JakeSays> _genuser_: i'd use sqlite's builtin aes encryption
[05:57:54] <khanred> You don't need encryption, just call the file notpasswords.db
[05:58:01] <JakeSays> LOL
[05:58:09] <_genuser_> JakeSays so clarification: I have a custom binary format that stores the encrypted value. Then you provide the password (which is file specific) and it will decrypt the file. The contents are then treated as text and show in an editor in app. If the first line happens to be passwords then more app goodies.
[05:58:33] <JakeSays> _genuser_: yeah i got ya
[05:58:47] <_genuser_> JakeSays looking into sqlite aes encryption.
[05:59:31] <_genuser_> JakeSays although, I have the same file parser (which respects versions) and a container format (2 or 3 versions so far), which can store any file encrypted. pictures, dbs, etc. So it was kinda easy to just re-use.
[05:59:38] <_genuser_> pull that into the project.
[05:59:39] <JakeSays> sqlite also has a plugable vfs layer so you could do whatever you wanted underneath
[06:00:03] <_genuser_> vfs .... would it support a text file with the first line .... "passwords\n"
[06:00:05] <_genuser_> LOL
[06:00:10] <JakeSays> _genuser_: LOL
[06:00:16] <_genuser_> laughing at my own joke, so cliche.
[06:00:36] <JakeSays> sqlite just makes a very easy to use file format, etc
[06:00:39] <_genuser_> https://www.sqlite.org/see/doc/trunk/www/readme.wiki
[06:00:46] <_genuser_> first line AES-256 support. not 512.
[06:01:08] <_genuser_> I think most of these are due to possible encryption export restrictions, if those are still a thing.
[06:01:11] <JakeSays> although in the past i've used my own build that changed the file magic bytes to not look like an sqlite file
[06:01:20] <JakeSays> they are
[06:01:36] <_genuser_> what am I missing here though with export restrictions?
[06:01:45] <JakeSays> i dunno
[06:01:58] <JakeSays> i'm not an export restrictions expert
[06:02:00] <_genuser_> what stops people from downloading open source code, requiring 512 bit key compiling it and using it?
[06:02:08] <JakeSays> nothing whatsoever
[06:02:20] <JakeSays> it just can't be provided by sqlite
[06:02:23] <_genuser_> I mean if the entire algorithm was a secret, I could see the point - don't make anything more than x available.
[06:03:16] <_genuser_> sqlite3 -key secret database.db
[06:03:19] <_genuser_> awesome!
[06:03:29] <_genuser_> the power of a database hidden behind encryption all provide by the vendor.
[06:03:39] <_genuser_> all you gotta do is write all the other bugs.
[06:03:44] <_genuser_> I mean the rest of the program.
[06:03:58] <JakeSays> lol sqlite supports xor encryption
[06:04:43] <_genuser_> JakeSays back in the day, we did a web app at work. And we pulled in AES encryption and all that stuff. Super high security. .... we used the exact same seed everytime.
[06:04:57] <_genuser_> JakeSays the pen test first said, it looked like a basic xor encryption. and showed us how to break it.
[06:05:17] <_genuser_> it took some googling to look at the seed and that it should be random everytime.
[06:05:23] <_genuser_> *pen test firm
[06:05:59] * JakeSays doesn't share his seed with just anyone
[06:06:24] <khanred> that's not what your wife said
[06:06:32] <_genuser_> _your_ seed or your encryption seed?
[06:06:38] <MatthiasVance> Yes _genuser_
[06:06:42] <khanred> I should have thought more about that joke
[06:06:49] <JakeSays> _genuser_: they're different?
[06:07:05] <JakeSays> no wonder no one will accept encrypted documents from me
[06:07:35] <_genuser_> JakeSays if all you know if encryption seeds then .... let me tell you there's other seeds....
[06:07:42] <_genuser_> just walk into any gardening hobby store.
[06:07:55] <_genuser_> there's herbs seeds, fruit seeds, etc....

[12:42:52] <xb0o2> Why on Earth is the API for Microsoft.Extensions.Logging so awkward...
[12:46:37] <xb0o2> As far as I can see the only way it supports logging properties is to either clutter the message to high hell or to begin a disposable scope
[12:47:04] <xb0o2> As if wanting to log properties that aren't part of the message is some kind of niche use case
[12:48:22] *** Joins: alguien_ (~alguien@user/alguien)
[12:49:09] <Nasp> xb0o2:  Serilog!
[12:49:30] <Nasp> Because that's also where i've never liked the MS logging when you want to log extra fields not part of template
[12:50:51] <xb0o2> Nasp: yeah, we use Serilog at the moment but some bright spark has proposed everything is moved across to Microsoft.Extensions.Logging because ...
[12:51:52] <Nasp> MS DI is fine, except when needing extra properties, because yes it can it's just not intuitive
[12:52:27] <jmer> isn't Microsoft.Extensions.Logging just a common interface?
[12:52:40] <Tobbi_> Morning peasants
[12:53:18] <xb0o2> `using var scope = Logger.BeginScope(new Dictionary<string, object> { ["Foo"] = bar, ["Baz"] = qux }); Logger.LogError(ex, "Uhoh");`
[12:53:33] <xb0o2> And that's somehow sane.
[12:54:40] <xb0o2> jmer: yeah but the actual methods to log only accept a message template and associated values
[12:55:01] <jmer> Do you need more? xD
[12:55:05] <xb0o2> Yes
[12:56:29] <xb0o2> Because it seems you basically have to contort your message to contain placeholders for properties you want to log

[12:59:28] <xb0o2> I don't think so, no
[13:00:21] <jmer> I don't know hwat you mean with contort, but the whole point of structured logging is to put in placeholders so Serilog (or whatever) can make those serachable in i.e. when using the ELK stack
[13:00:21] <Nasp> jmer:  It is
[13:00:32] <xb0o2> I'd rather a log entry with a message `Failed to update foo` with some relevant properties attached than a message of `Failed to update foo id {Id} with bar {Bar} and baz {Baz}`
[13:00:36] <Nasp> xb0o2:  I prefer the PushProperties or enricher
[13:00:55] <jmer> xb0o2: but then you can't search all events based on Id = whatever
[13:01:04] <xb0o2> jmer: you can.
[13:01:24] <xb0o2> jmer: the log properties are attached in both cases, you just don't need the placeholders in the message.
[13:04:09] <Nasp> log.PushProperty("Foo", "Bar") Much easier :D

[13:57:32] <jmer> I just realized that this system's database is designed in such a manner that the type of contents in a column can change based on the product number
[13:58:11] <jmer> i.e. so the product has Columns: Col1, Col2,Col3 but Col3 might have different meanings on two different products... like ENTIRELY different meanings
[13:58:30] <edcba> are there duplicated columns then ?
[14:00:34] <jmer> edcba: I don't think so... But on product with number 12 Col3 might be the weight whereas in product with number 1 Col3 might refer to voltage

[14:00:56] <xb0o2> jmer: brings back memories of a place I used to work where it used the database of an accounting package that was in place before the system.

[14:01:15] <jmer> sounds like a Navision setup xD
[14:02:05] <xb0o2> CHAR1 in the context of one customer might be say, a person's name, and in another might be their payroll number

[14:02:30] <jmer> I shudder at the CPU cycles wasted on this shitty data model

[18:49:53] <Mechanismus> random solicitation for opinion: It is considered a best practice to keep application source code separate from IaC and configuration management code.  Supposing that these two repos were stored side by side (say, in the same github organization) and that the application repo is called "foo", what would you call the repo containing the IaC/CM code?  "foo-config"?  "foo-infra"?  "foo-env"?  "other"?
[18:50:22] <jonp`> *is it* considered a best practice?
[18:50:25] *** jonp` is now known as jonp
[18:50:30] <jonp> not sure i've ever heard of that before
[18:50:59] <Mechanismus> I've read it in a number of places, but I mentioned something about this to my manager and he was like, "CITE UR SOURCE" and I was like "fuck you I'm looking for another job"
[18:51:19] <Mechanismus> the gist is like this
[18:52:22] <Mechanismus> Think about the SDLC for the application itself.  Ultimately, the pipeline from dev workstation to production-deployable-artifact should be independent of how operators will deploy and configure the app and on what infra.
[18:52:51] <Mechanismus> Similarly, from an ops perspective I don't need to bump the application version number just to change the JVM allocated memory config or whatever.
[18:53:22] <Mechanismus> like... I might care about it from a helm deployment perspective, but the application source code doesn't have to change for that.

[18:56:22] <Mechanismus> both repos can have a fully automated pipeline and use trunk based development, completely freeing up engineers to get work Done(TM)
[18:57:53] <Mechanismus> if you're trying to do some coordinated dance to get ops' config changes into the repo ~around the same time that an arbitrary software engineer merges a particular branch containing a given feature or whatever then you're clogging up the plumbing and restricting the amount of useful work that can get done per unit time

[19:05:37] <jonp> Mechanismus: given that background, i'd say that the "config" repo should have a name relevant to where it's being used, which may be a name *entirely unrelated* to `foo`
[19:05:46] <jonp> like "azure-config" or something
[19:05:56] <Mechanismus> If the application is Called Master Blaster and the application source code repo is called master-blaster, what should the IaC/CM repo be called?

[19:08:22] <Mechanismus> tbh, part of me wants to call it master-blaster-ops because it's shit that ops cares about, except that in my current org the "ops" team has nothing to do with IT-Ops or infrastructure
[19:10:38] <Nasp> Mechanismus:  Isn't that kinda gitops?
[19:11:31] <Mechanismus> tl;dr - this is all about naming convention, because if the application is a dotnet core API called Corp.Product.Orders then, semantically, what does Corp.Product.Orders-config mean?
[19:12:13] <Mechanismus> Nasp: that's not the point
[19:12:47] <Mechanismus> but, to your point, if you mean "gitops" not "GitOps" like how I mean "agile" not "Agile" then I guess maybe it's gitops
[19:14:19] <Mechanismus> I mean... asking about gitops in this context feels a lot like a violation of the first principle of the agile manifesto: "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"
[19:20:26] <Lizard__> if the application is named MasterBlaster the config repo would be called Semen, obviously
[19:20:28] <Mechanismus> I guess the reason I'm reluctant to say that I'm talking about gitops here is that IIRC gitops is a specific set of tools for managing application configuration and deployments on kubernetes clusters, and what I'm talking about includes IaC configurations with Terraform and CM with Ansible and other stuff that's not strictly gitops.
[19:20:42] <Mechanismus> Lizard__: compelling argument
[19:22:29] <Mechanismus> however, I'm looking for a pattern which makes it clear that "this is the repo containing the deployment infra and configuration for the application <x>" at a glance without sowing confusion when you have some kinda SOA config service in play called Corp.Product.Services.Config such that the config repo is Corp.Product.Services.Config-config
[19:23:10] <Mechanismus> I mean... "naming is the hardest problem in software engineering", so I'm soliciting feedback here

[19:24:10] <Lizard__> ask the marketing team, they ought to have countless ideas

[19:34:12] <Mechanismus> My question was, yes
[19:34:25] <Mechanismus> "or something like it" is my problem here
[19:35:37] <Mechanismus> if it's "Foo-infra" then it's not immediately clear this contains CM.  If it's "Foo-config" then it's not immediately clear that it contains IaC and maybe confuses apps with "config" somewhere in the name.
[19:36:02] <Mechanismus> If it's "Foo-deploy" then it's unclear whether this is about deployment pipeline or what.

[19:49:07] <Mechanismus> Nasp: Previously we've had the IaC and CM code in the same repo as the app source.  This results in some challenges and headaches/waste with regard to pipelines.  Separating those concerns would help immensely, but I want to get the naming right before someone coopts and ruins my work here.

[23:06:45] <MatthiasVance> So 3.5EUR?
[23:06:49] <jmer> eerh
[23:06:55] <jmer> I don't know why that became a $
[23:07:00] <jmer> I mean about 4€
[23:07:08] <MatthiasVance> That's a good price
[23:07:11] <jmer> 3.7€ to be precise
[23:07:14] <jmer> I think it's VERY good
[23:07:17] <MatthiasVance> Would totally pay that every day for a good lunch
[23:07:21] <jmer> it's the best work food I've ever had acess to
[23:07:30] <jmer> there's a hot meal, several sandwich types and a salad.
[23:07:40] <jmer> each costs those 3.7-4€
[23:08:02] <jmer> I used to pay 40€ pr month
[23:08:06] <jmer> no matter how often I ate there
[23:08:15] <MatthiasVance> I should totally get healthy lunches delivered or something
[23:08:32] <jmer> the salad is always healthy
[23:08:45] <jmer> but sometimes the hot meal isn't xD
[23:08:50] <jmer> (still fucking delicious though)
[23:09:21] <jmer> like this one: https://www.arla.dk/opskrifter/bofsandwich-med-brun-sovs/
[23:09:27] <jmer> which is a classic danish style junk food meal
[23:13:04] <MatthiasVance> Bøfsandwich med brun sovs -> Beef sandwich with brown sauce?
[23:13:12] <jmer> brown sauce = Gravy
[23:13:18] <MatthiasVance> Yeah this was the literal translationi
[23:13:26] <MatthiasVance> So hamburger with gravy

[23:13:30] <jmer> well...
[23:13:34] <jmer> yes it is
[23:14:20] <MatthiasVance> Suchiman: durrr
[23:14:34] <MatthiasVance> Dutch is a terrible language
[23:14:46] <jmer> I would be 100% freaked out if a partner of mine called me "daddy"
[23:19:33] <MatthiasVance> Yes!
[23:22:28] <jmer> https://youtu.be/nIaan75mAx8?t=1034 <- This week in videogames has a new section called "NFT: No fucking thanks" and I love how he is just... xD lol
[23:22:52] <riksteri> I don't think browsers cache across different domains anymore, for privacy reasons (it can leak to domain A you have visited domain B). So using a CDN for jquery etc. is not helpful from that perspective.
[23:29:45] <jmer> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[23:30:17] <MatthiasVance> riksteri: Say what now?
[23:30:25] <MatthiasVance> The CDN is the same domain
[23:31:25] <MatthiasVance> riksteri: Do you have any info on what "you think"? :D
[23:35:09] <MatthiasVance> "Bolero HotReload: failed to reload" 🤦‍♂️

[23:51:33] <irwiss> yeah ads and trackers are the internet cancer
[23:51:45] <jmer> I felt so dirty when I worked for one of those ecommerce houses
[23:52:11] <Suchiman> MatthiasVance: btw. it's extra funny if you're german because if you pronounce it it sounds kinda like german with thicc accent
[23:52:22] <jmer> and listening to the inebriated talk between marketing consultants at the christmas dinner was like listening to two siths
[23:52:42] <irwiss> lol
[23:53:26] <jmer> Seriously they have zero qualms about tracking everyone, everywhere as long as they can force fed their damned "funnel" they are happy campers
