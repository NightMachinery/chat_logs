[00:36:32] <maroon> gevreeen, if you're wanting to shrink your RSA key to transcribe it from paper, you can pare it down to only the 2 primes and e, since you can recreate d and n from that. but if you need to preserve the fingerprint too then you'd need to transcribe pretty much everything including the start/expire dates and all the name labels

[02:32:46] <int-e> maroon: I think you "import" a modulus by appending to /etc/ssh/moduli. It's funny that the portable and the BSD versions of this look different. In any case, the BSD page says "Screened DH groupsmay be installed in /etc/moduli." which does not suggest automation to me. I wonder whether their internal code for this is different as well...
[02:34:25] <int-e> maroon: So if you skip the screening (or filtering, indicated by -f) step, it should accept any generator. If you do the screening, it will only accept 2 and 5 and they have to generate the whole group. (Oh and if 2 generates the whole group it won't accept 5.)
[02:36:11] <maroon> i find it hard to believe that they will encourage appending sketchy-origin.txt to the moduli file :)
[02:38:11] <int-e> Oh sure, you're not supposed to append anything that hasn't passed screening.

[04:31:38] <maroon> i wonder if it's against their philosophy to recover half of the discarded safe primes by allowing g=0x10001 17
[04:36:17] <int-e> I mean, if this code had seen some love... the first obvious thing to do would be to only track p's that are -1 (mod 12). Easy reduction of the sieve size by a factor of 3, and it should make things a bit faster as well. (Though for that, I suspect the bottleneck is actually the modular reduction,...

[07:52:03] <thomas25> ms7821 what about LE's CA is infiltrated and needs to be revoked and updated?
[07:52:50] <thomas25> i think if i have to use TLS in the gateway device i MUST implement a way to update CA's. is there a defacto way to do that?
[07:53:46] <danieldg> firmware update
[07:53:59] <danieldg> that's the usual method for rotating a CA
[07:54:09] <danieldg> basically, revocation is hard
[07:57:09] <Peng> Yes, you should definitely implement a way to update the CA trust store.
[07:57:15] <Peng> People fuck that up and brick all their devices.
[07:57:52] <Peng> My cell phone was acting funny for a few weeks after DST Root CA X3 expired but then it got a software update. :>
[07:59:01] <Peng> I think the BBC and/or Netflix have written about the contortions they go through so that their web services continue to work with piece of crap set-top boxes with old trust stores and TLS libs.
[07:59:40] <Peng> For that matter, you need to be able to update your TLS library. And OS. And everything else.
[08:00:41] <thomas25> yeah, a bootloader and a firmware update is in the backlog indeed
[08:01:15] <thomas25> i think a fallback to plaintext with confirmation from the gateway operator might also be necessary
[08:02:15] <thomas25> it's not too bad as even if i put together a half assed version of TLS myself, I need a way to rotate my keys as well

[10:09:26] <maroon> once the salted__ header is gone, the only clue should be that the filesize inside the base64 is a multiple of 16

[10:13:15] <varayu> Oh sorry, it's base64
[10:14:01] <maroon> if chacha20 exposes a nonce in addition to the IV, make sure the nonce appears as if it's random rather than simplistic sequential
