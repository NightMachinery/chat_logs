[00:31:10] <iDrougge> _rubik: Depends on your home conditions.
[00:32:09] <iDrougge> But I think my home office is much more like a real office than the football court full of desks with ten year old screens that is what my workplace calls an office.
[00:33:49] <technomancy> requiring a return to the office for programmers is some real grade-A bullshit; I'd straight up refuse if my manager told me to
[00:34:26] <wink> _rubik: word is that we're supposed to go back 1 day per week "soonish", that's for the software development dept. I like that, due to nice bike commute
[00:34:40] <bkero> Go find a new job.
[00:35:03] <wink> jftr, I am perfectly happy at home, but I'd like to get out more
[00:35:38] <technomancy> allowing a return for people who want to seems ok as long as you have a clear policy of when to reverse course if infections go back up (which is the part my local government has been fucking up)
[00:36:04] <wink> yeah, ofc, different thing. I was talking long-term
[00:36:10] <bkero> You think they'll lengthen a leash? Hahaha.

[00:36:14] <wink> "soonish". maybe not this year :P

[00:38:14] <technomancy> I feel like if I continue this conversation I'm gonna accidentally end up defending some nasty shit so I guess I'll just bow out now =)
[00:39:04] <bkero> The word 'bayhole' comes to mind
[00:39:07] <bkero> Not you, but the companies
[00:39:20] <technomancy> last time I had a job that made me go in regularly was 2008
[00:39:32] <technomancy> but I recognize I have a lot of privilege
[00:39:33] <wink> don't you just love it if your GUI app starts just fine from the ide, but not without it?
[00:40:03] <bkero> That is some privilege, I share the same. I've actively chosen to have my career as remote.
[00:40:11] <bkero> As such I've spent the last 2 months in El Salvador.
[00:40:20] <technomancy> yeah I spent 2 years in thailand
[00:42:09] <bkero> Thailand is a good place. They recently reintroduced test-and-go.
[00:42:24] <bkero> I've been considering getting a place in Mae Rim.
[00:42:36] <siraben> bkero: oh, that’s good

[22:50:09] <kline> which certainly has a point, needless churn is horrible and i dont think that having to learn a new system every year is good value
[22:50:47] <kline> but thats 1) not a systemd problem and 2) not really what is happening with systemd, its not meaningfully changing in how you use it every year, you only really need to learn it once

[22:51:06] <wrl> ngl i hate the thing systemd does where, when a service isn't shutting down properly, i have to sit there and wait for 90 seconds while i'm just trying to shut down my computer and leave the house
[22:51:10] <wrl> or pack my laptop into a bag
[22:51:16] <river> so irritating
[22:51:23] <wrl> why can't i just ctrl-c
[22:51:25] <kline> wrl, have you investigated why?
[22:51:27] <river> ive spent real time trying to fix those
[22:51:33] <river> it's a huge hassle
[22:51:34] <wrl> kline: yeah it's "by design"
[22:51:45] <kline> wrl, no, i mean why is that unit taking so long to shut down
[22:51:55] <wrl> kline: it happens once every few months
[22:52:08] <jmiven> besides, the timeout is configurable...
[22:52:09] <wrl> and i never know which unit it actually is, because it's always the "user session" or "user manager" or sth
[22:52:13] <kline> systemd tries to avoid any kind of issue by ensuring that everything starts/shuts down correctly, and doesnt like to carry on in a broken state when it can avoid it as much as possible
[22:52:28] <kline> so if systemd is taking a long time to close, its probably because something is refusing to quit
[22:52:31] <wrl> jmiven: yes, which would be *great* if i could modify it when i'm actually waiting for it
[22:52:38] <wrl> kline: right, i don't care, i just want to ctrl-c and get on with my day
[22:52:42] <wrl> i know *why* it's happening
[22:52:51] <wrl> or, rather, *why* systemd is doing it
[22:52:51] <kline> wrl, then hold the power button for 10s or whatever
[22:53:04] <wrl> i hate everything about that
[22:53:35] <mockturtle> Retrofitting Async/Await in Go 1.18 [go] (carlmjohnson) https://lobste.rs/s/noruqt
[22:53:39] <wrl> i'm just going to write this and submit it as a PR
[22:53:45] *** Joins: MerchantOfVenice (~patrick@user/merchantofvenice)
[22:53:47] <kline> systemd is only stalling because it doesnt know that it can safely power off, if the thing thats stalling is, say, a remote filesystem trying to send data back to the server, then its not safe to shutdown
[22:54:03] <kline> systemd seems slow and ponderous because it doesnt like doing things if state is fucky
[22:54:16] <kline> youve always had this problem, its just been ignored until systemd started respecting it
[22:54:34] <kline> its the same with booting with failed disks that arent marked non-essential
[22:54:39] <wrl> ok is there any key combination i can hit systemd with that says "dump me to a shell here so i can figure out what's going on" or "stop the thing you are doing right now"
[22:54:53] <wrl> because otherwise the 90 second wait is doing nothing but prolonging the inevitable
[22:55:46] <river> they should get sponsers and put ads on that 90 mins screen
[22:55:48] <kline> then identify the broken unit and say it can only take 1s to close down
[22:55:48] <river> 90 secs*
[22:56:25] <kline> i need to pop out before a meeting in 30 mins
[22:56:27] <wrl> kline: the problem is that i don't *know* what the unit is because this happens intermittently
[22:57:01] <wrl> so, again, do you know of any way i can have systemd dump me to a shell or give me any way to abort or interrupt the current situation
[22:57:16] <kline> wrl, then next time it happens look at the log from the end of the last boot. you can either do this the old school way by writing down the time and navigating to that timestamp in logs, or you can use journalctls nice features like "show me the last 20 mins of logging" or "show me logs only from the last boot"
[22:57:50] <kline> wrl, i have no idea if it works but have you tried pinging yourself into a different tty with ctrl+alt+F<something> ?
[22:58:05] <wrl> ok so if systemd doesn't give me a way to do that then this seems like a token effort at best, and the "doesn't know it can safely power off" or "state is fucky" safeguards seem extremely lukewarm at best
[22:58:22] <kline> its a tradeoff
[22:58:29] <kline> no one will ever be happy
[22:58:33] <wrl> just let me press ctrl-c
[22:58:33] <river> i had never even thought of a key command
[22:58:37] <wrl> just let me say "no stop"
[22:58:38] <river> gbut that's actually a wonderful idea
