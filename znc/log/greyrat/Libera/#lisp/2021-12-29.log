[02:20:38] <yottabyte> yeah, I did, I find those docs very hard to read
[02:20:38] <moon-child> (aside: that was a _very_ snappy response from the bot, I am surprised)
[02:21:24] <yottabyte> that is clearer. maybe the CLHS cookbook should have that
[02:21:57] <yottabyte> so while line do has the nil check end-test-form built in?
[02:22:09] <moon-child> well.  There is an 'essential problem of LOOP' or some such, described somewhere
[02:22:33] <moon-child> yottabyte: well, alright, you may think of it rather as 'until (null line)'.  It amounts to the same thing
[02:22:40] <moon-child> NIL is false, and all that is not NIL is true

[07:34:31] <duncan_bayne> Happy new year :)  I'm trying to write a test for a usocket based library, germinal.  My approach is to redefine certain special variables with a let form in the test, so I can set my own test certificate etc.  This *almost* works, but fails in the usocket handler itself because that's being called in a different context, i.e., where the special variables *aren't* shadowed.

[07:36:20] <duncan_bayne> Is there a trick I'm missing, here, or do I need to refactor the library under test to parameterise the values to change, instead of relying on shadowed special variables?

[13:54:10] <engblom> I remeber the first program I worked on during a summer job. We were making it in Delphi and it was using mysql as storage. Everything worked really well in our manual tests. Then I decided to make a progam generating a lot of data and the program begun to crawl.
[13:54:51] <engblom> That program showed that you need to think when making SQL queries, that they are not automatically optimized to scale well.

[22:29:09] <jgart> I'm a bit confused with hash quote. I read that most of the time you'd want #'

[22:34:41] <amazigh> jgart: re pydoc, yes. Except as of today, as part of the standard, Scheme parameters are oblivious of POSIX or green threads. Chez Scheme that support POSIX threads, has several kinds of paremeters (Chez does not support green threads out-of-the-box). Gambit parameters are very much like contextvars basically thread local variables for green threads.

[23:05:05] <jgart> What is the purpose of `(function foo)` in common lisp?
[23:05:21] <jgart> Emacs says it is like ‘quote’, but preferred for objects which are functions.
[23:06:40] <jgart> In scheme I can just do (quote foo) for a function. There's no differentiation between a function and any other object that can be quoted.
[23:07:18] <moon-child> jgart: foo, when evaluated, results in the value of symbol foo in the value namespace
[23:07:21] <jgart> It seems emacs lisp uses (function foo) for the byte compiler
[23:07:29] <moon-child> (function foo), when evaluated, results in the value of symbol foo in the function namespace
[23:08:08] <jgart> oh, so it's a lisp-2 thing?
[23:08:14] <moon-child> indeed
[23:08:30] <moon-child> note you can use #'foo as shorthand for (function foo)
[23:08:45] <moon-child> (just as 'foo is shorthand for (quote foo))
[23:09:13] <jgart> the need to differentiate between the two namespaces: function and variable
[23:09:37] <jgart> or should I be using/thinking value instead of variable?
[23:09:50] <moon-child> the relationship to quote in emacs comes from emacs's lack of lexical scoping.  Common lisp has lexical scoping, so they are not quite the same
[23:10:10] <moon-child> you may pass a symbol to FUNCALL or APPLY, in which case it will be looked up globally
[23:10:29] <moon-child> so given (defun f (x) (+ x 2)), (funcall 'f 3) and (funcall #'f 3) will both result in 5
[23:10:41] <jgart> doesn't modern elisp have lexical scoping now?
[23:10:58] <moon-child> but (flet ((f (x) (+ x 4))) (values (funcall 'f 3) (funcall #'f 3))) results in 5 7
[23:11:14] <moon-child> 'modern elisp have lexical scoping now'  I do not know
[23:12:08] <sham1> It has had lexical scoping for a bit now. But it's not default, no
[23:12:15] <sham1> That'd break a lot of legacy code

[23:19:18] <jgart> moon-child, `(flet ((f (x) (+ x 4))) (values (funcall 'f 3) (funcall #'f 3)))` #' looks in the lexical scope of the flet and ' looks in the global scope. Is that one way I can think about it?
[23:20:10] <moon-child> ' doesn't look anywhere
[23:20:17] <moon-child> 'f evaluates to the symbol f
[23:20:30] <moon-child> _funcall_ then looks for the corresponding function in the global scope
[23:21:05] <moon-child> #'f evaluates to a function, so it is indeed lexical
[23:22:47] <moon-child> (in particular, functions and symbols are both function designators)
[23:22:49] <jgart> so, #' is always lexical?
[23:23:02] <jgart> and ' is not
[23:23:52] <jgart> because ' or quote doesn't know/care about scope
[23:24:39] <jgart> quote only knows about the thing being a symbol without contextualizing it in a scope
[23:28:47] <dpk> jgart: the schemedoc page is talking about #"…" as a notation for a string-like thing. #' is used in Scheme for syntax, a version of quote that maintains lexical hygiene
[23:29:50] <dpk> so #'x isn't the symbol x, but the identifier x, with information about whether it's bound, where, and what bindings it might possibly shadow
[23:31:16] <jgart> dpk, #' is used in the service of the macro system? you mentioned hygiene
[23:31:59] <dpk> yes, in the syntax-case macro system
[23:33:34] <jgart> which is the one that implements hygiene
[23:33:40] <dpk> all of them
[23:33:54] <moon-child> DEFMACRO is not hygienic
[23:34:02] <dpk> *all of them in Scheme
[23:34:25] <moon-child> define-macro is pretty broadly implemented, I think
[23:34:45] <moon-child> (though not standard, I guess)
[23:35:15] <jgart> guile has defmacro but I forgot now if it is an alias/macro for something in scheme or an actual implementation of lisp defmacro
[23:35:31] <dpk> the one CLers like to bitch and whine about is syntax-rules, which is a template-substitution system: nice for simple macros, and *can* do complicated macros, but gets hairy quickly. syntax-case is syntax-rules plus the ability to run arbitrary Scheme code during expansion, meaning you get everything you can do in CL macros and more (advanced pattern matching, and the ability to investigate identifiers' lexical contexts)
[23:35:34] <jgart> guile also has define-macro
[23:35:58] <dpk> you can implement defmacro in terms of syntax-case, and i think Guile does that for compatibility with older Guile code before they added hygienic macros
[23:36:02] <jgart> but guilers usually use the syntax-case hygiene system
[23:36:16] <dpk> yeah, exactly
[23:36:48] <jgart> I like the simplicity of the defmacro syntax
[23:37:40] <jgart> syntax-case hygiene macros feel a bit verbose
[23:37:57] <amazigh> try syntax-rule
[23:37:58] <jgart> but maybe whatever
[23:40:47] <jgart> amazigh, you mean syntax-rules with define-syntax to bind it?

[23:49:17] <amazigh> the implementation is straightforward based on syntax-rules, but I never remember it
[23:49:26] <amazigh> (fwiw, I do not write a lot of macros)
[23:51:02] <jgart> define-syntax-rule seems to be reminiscent of defmacro

[23:52:54] <jgart> fun fun functions
