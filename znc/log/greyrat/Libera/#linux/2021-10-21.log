[00:28:54] <n4dir> you could have a quick look at the script. More or less a oneliner
[00:29:14] <Guest17> I needed to edit /etc/default/grub and was not doing that. I think on other distros the file you edit is different too.
[00:29:39] <Guest17> I was doing the grub.d/customfile
[00:30:28] <Guest17> But that didn't work. So, grub-mkconfig may have worked, I'm not sure if I tested that again. But, when I saw ubuntu instructions for update-grub, I realized that was probably the best command.

[03:17:36] <keir> June 2020
[03:17:41] <n4dir> more context: debian-live or live-build or whatever to create live debian iso came into the world, but it that no way to install it. Thats how refracta started, iirc
[03:17:49] <n4dir> keir: yeah, probably that
[03:18:00] <keir> and it seemed to have hurt Canonical's feelings
[03:18:01] <a1> Is anyone aware of a max filesize for a grub.cfg?
[03:18:13] <n4dir> your inside google grandma is back to life, it seems. Thanks for the info

[03:20:00] <keir> i feel like messing with snapd is not great for a newbie though
[03:20:00] <madprops> do btrfs snapshots include files in mounted points? I don't want to include mounted partitions ..
[03:20:17] <keir> you kind of want a healthy experience out of the box

[03:21:44] <keir> n4dir: is ubuntu-studio your daily driver?
[03:22:02] <n4dir> it took me longer than 10 years to add third-party repos or apps to debian, and in general i am still not too happy about it

[03:22:47] <n4dir> keir: well, i wanted to start with audio-stuff, did a google-search and youtube-search, folks said it is hard to set up, but there are distros for it. U-Studio, AV-Linux, KX-Linux and such
[03:22:58] <keir> i just won't install anything proprietary
[03:23:00] <n4dir> so i installed it and used it then for everything, so yes.
[03:23:12] *** Joins: self (~elf@user/elf)
[03:23:19] <n4dir> then, as i feel more comfortable and at home in debian, i went for a different solution
[03:23:40] <n4dir> AV-Linux i didn't really like, so i went for the not well-known "Librazik"
[03:24:10] <n4dir> but, as said, only as i feel more at home with debian than with ubuntu, not because ubuntu-studio had "problems"
[03:24:29] <n4dir> and it does graphics stuff too, which i don't really care for
[03:24:43] <keir> once you're clued up on the linux environment, debian gives you a lot more flexibility

[03:25:19] <n4dir> it seems pretty solid
[03:25:52] <n4dir> tried a few others, after systemd entered the world, but in the end, i really prefer debian based (none of the others were "bad")

[03:31:59] <lantech19446> keir: it looks like it to me and it's a much nicer site
[03:32:11] <keir> (website also shows 2016)
[03:32:16] <tacokoneko> i'm reading the documentation for CONFIG_CPUSETS here https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cpuset.7.html and it seems to very strongly imply that "memory nodes" and "NUMA nodes" are synonymous, i.e. a system with "1" after "NUMA node(s):" in lscpu has ONE "memory node" for the purposes of cpusets. would this assumption be true?
[03:32:47] *** Joins: deavmi (~tbk@user/deavmi)
[03:32:54] <n4dir> keir: they had entries for repos which debian would call "testing". So, if that still works, i couldn't care less for a new release or not. + slackbuilds and all.
[03:33:04] <n4dir> not that i would care much for versions

[03:48:03] <keir> i guess, to function is this world without being an outcast, you have to accept non-free compromises
[03:48:32] <n4dir> as i hardly use wireless and crappy hardware in general, i usually would get away with at least debian-free
[03:48:40] <n4dir> or "main", as they call it
[03:48:47] <n4dir> but of course you are right.
[03:49:08] <keir> normalising free attitudes is would be healthy though
[03:49:31] <n4dir> if i run in a PC and have the only option to throw it away or to add contrib/non-free, then i go for contrib/non-free.

[05:05:30] <zumba_addict> Hey all, question. Our sshd in pam forwards auth request to an external Active Directory. However, I also found that from the same python script that if user that is trying to login does not exist locally, it creates it locally and adds it to /etc/passwd. Why would someone do that?

[05:10:01] <zumba_addict> so I guess, when AD authenticates the user and it passes, the user won't be able to terminal if user does not exist. That's my only guess right now
[05:10:06] <keir> KillerWasp: because you're creating unncessary confusion
[05:10:38] <keir> and being alarmist to boot
[05:10:50] <KillerWasp> keir# It is not a confusion, it is some stupid code that interferes, it cannot create user by some authentication method.

[05:13:10] <zumba_addict> yep and I think my guess is really correct about not being able to have a shell when user does not exist even if they get authenticated by our external AD

[05:17:10] <zumba_addict> no, just shell access
[05:17:27] <zumba_addict> it's applies to any of our linux servers

[05:18:39] <fdeer> like you need a python script to create accounts to have a centralized management...
[05:18:45] <KillerWasp> zumba_addict# or fix the script of python

[06:05:03] <madprops> im grepping netstat and see some pids
[06:05:31] <jessemacdougall> n4dir, I am trying to find out how to download and run How do I download this file and run it? I have github installed on machine How do I download and install this? https://github.com/solusipse/fiche I was thinking "git clone [URL]"?

[06:06:09] <bparker> you must compile the code

[09:16:02] <pnbeast> tarel2, you can try several things.  Network scanning is one.  Running arpwatch on one of the machines might help, too.  Asking your gateway (if you can...) might help.

[10:15:14] <Kim^J> Hi, I've received a question regarding monitoring Linux servers. Our current monitoring solution is OP5 with nrped installed on each Linux server we're monitoring. We're about to implement a new monitoring system (ManageEngine OpManager) where the proposed solution is to use SNMP to monitor the Linux servers. My reaction to this is "Wtf?" but I need to back this up with some evidence...

Right?
[16:22:46] <p`> pankaj_: many have no concept of storing inodes and trees and such on a disk, instead they're presenting _their tasks_ to you in a way that looks like that structure and can be access by that structure.  this is probably a really bad way to describe it, technically

[20:46:13] <zfigz> 👋
[20:46:33] <zfigz> is there anything wrong with using hybrid-sleep vs suspend-then-hibernate ?
[20:47:00] <zfigz> like the fact that hybrid-sleep write to your disk every time whereas suspend-then-hibernate does it the once.
[20:48:03] <MockingMoniker> What's the easiest way to take a list of lines in a file that should be edited such that the line is mostly the same, except a certain part is modified according to the rules? For example, I have a file with two lines, "var1=abc!butifitwerentso" and "var2=itsshowtime@abc" and I want to replace only "abc" with "def" on these lines? I created a loops over sed but I used name groups around abc and then I realized that it might not work
[20:48:03] <MockingMoniker> so elegantly.
[20:48:07] <p`> rendar: i don't have my nvme system up right now but it'd be an early one on it, but it might just be the "namespace", re: nvme naming
[20:48:33] <p`> rendar: can you see if disk io is actually occuring with, like, iostat or iotop

[21:57:34] <RayTracer> I didn't try any *ubuntu lately, but its big advantage was that it made it really easy to use proprietary drivers, whereas you need to hop through different hoops with other distros

[23:03:36] <TheGuestMovie> and Debian for server
[23:03:43] <MeCrumbly429> Nope. Snaps are slow and buggy, but they're forgivable. What's not forgivable is throwing them into the faces of new users and wondering why they're turned off

[23:04:03] <MeCrumbly429> *why they're turning away from linux
[23:04:08] <XJ8> Alpine linux isn't really meant to be used for regular use. It's a router distro. busybox is broken beyond repair.
[23:04:11] <TheGuestMovie> XJ8: not a fan of snaps, except for desktop apps, and even then...
