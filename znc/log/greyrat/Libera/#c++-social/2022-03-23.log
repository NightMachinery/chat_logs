[02:17:35] <Juliu> Yes. That is always what they do. Fascists

[02:21:07] <Juliu> I also said before that cryptography might not exist, and people thought I was joking. People are weird
[02:22:57] <T`aZ> need more context
[02:23:22] <Juliu> With respect to what?
[02:23:39] <T`aZ> your kick/question/answer
[02:24:38] <Juliu> He asked me why people would tolerate a moronic liar, and I answered that I dont know why they always tolderate liars, and said it is probably because they're dumb
[02:24:54] <Juliu> *tolerate
[02:55:29] <Juliu> Why do I even answer people if I either get banned or they just ignore me?
[02:57:28] <T`aZ> ha, i see the problem, you are expecting people to react with reasons
[02:59:25] <Juliu> Yes, my mistake. I always forget that people are irrational

[13:30:29] <Renderwww> every couple of months I have to look at some local xml file with xslt next to it, every time firefox changed something for security reasons and I have to figure out what switch to flick to make it work again
[13:30:50] <Renderwww> might as well just use internet explorer for that crap
[13:57:48] <Carbonflux> iirc explorer is now a form of chromium?
[13:59:44] <barometz> Edge is, Internet Explorer only still exists because old stuff depends on its quirks so it will never change engines
