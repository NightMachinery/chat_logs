[02:34:59] <anerisgreat> Is this thing alive?
[02:35:16] <bandali> sure
[02:35:21] <bandali> usually pretty quiet tho
[02:35:34] <anerisgreat> Wow! Pretty surprised. Good to know tho that people are connected!
[02:35:56] <anerisgreat> Was looking through modes I haven't connected, realized I never used ERC...
[02:35:56] <bandali> :) of course here is not nearly as large as #emacs itself
[02:36:15] <anerisgreat> Well isn't there something good about being the underdog? (or some other excuse)
[02:36:20] <bandali> oh yeah, irc is still fairly big in these circles haha
[02:36:32] <bandali> [or that's what we tell ourselves ;)]
