[22:00:07] <d_bot_> <VPhantom> Thanks for the improvements btw; I can't wait to dive into it.
[22:03:23] <companion_cube> I'm trying to make a client library for opentelemetry
[22:03:28] <companion_cube> turns out it's all protobuf
[22:08:07] <d_bot_> <mbacarella> :crying guy with crewcut meme:
[22:11:15] <Corbin> And they wonder why plaintext Prometheus is so popular among cloud engineers in comparison. Maybe if they rename OpenTelemetry again, it'll finally be attractive?
[22:12:36] <companion_cube> I mean, protobuf isn't great, but it seems reasonable for this use case?
[22:16:47] <d_bot_> <Anurag> protobuf itself seems fine for this use case. Its nice to see they have http as an option for opentelemetry now. Last time I looked at it I mistakenly thought opentelemetry only speaks grpc, and ended up focusing efforts on writing a library that specifically works with the elastic observability offering's wire protocol.
[22:17:11] <companion_cube> yeah it's http compatible now
