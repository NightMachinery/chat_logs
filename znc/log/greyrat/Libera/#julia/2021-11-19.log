[00:17:32] <wrycode> I'm trying to get set up with the Revise workflow described here: https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/workflow-tips/
[00:18:25] <wrycode> I can import .jl files from my new template but I can't seem to Pkg.add them
[00:18:39] <wrycode> ERROR: The following package names could not be resolved:
[00:18:39] <wrycode>  * Pandemic (not found in project, manifest or registry)
[00:19:44] <wrycode> also the basic commands given in that guide like `t = Template()` don't work, you have to run the template wizard with `Template(interactive=true)("MyPkg")`
[00:20:44] <wrycode> I'm in .julia/dev/Pandemic and everything, what are the actual commands to load my package so I can start working on it?
[00:29:21] <wrycode> wasted over an hour on this, pretty frustrating. Just the most basic set up that I followed word for word from the official docs
[00:39:36] <wrycode> I did finally get it, the problem is that the default template from PkgTemplates didn't work with the commands given on that page (like `using MyPkg`)
[00:39:40] <wrycode> or maybe I'm just dumb
[00:47:02] <wrycode> It's always the most annoying thing with a new programming language, learning how to organize the code. Not just Julia

[06:40:40] <nagefire> wrycode it may be more helpful to learn how to use Pkg before you try PkgTemplates
[06:41:04] <nagefire> wrycode I've written over 6 packages and I've never had to use PkgTemplates
[06:41:28] <nagefire> wrycode I also recommend Pluto.jl for a very user-friendly development experience
