[00:18:20] <apotheon> Oh, you want something JavaScript-less.  I dunno.

[01:50:57] <Hash> A MAN who has eaten nothing but raw meat for almost a decade, says he has never felt healthier. Eating everything from sheep’s stomach smoothies to animal spleen, liver and testicles, Derek Nance, 35, lives off a diet almost entirely made up of raw meat. The self-confessed carnivore from Lexington, Kentucky says the only parts of the animal he won’t eat are the hooves and the horns. Derek
[01:50:59] <Hash> has followed his caveman-style diet for close to 10 years now and the father-of four, who maintains eating raw meat is safe, even feeds his children it. His partner, however, who used to be a vegetarian, still won’t eat raw meat.

[03:01:19] <pulse> Guest39, That's not really what bluffing is about, especially in online poker. It's more about psychology and understanding other players
[03:01:28] <Decker> and sin/cos are fast enough it doesn't really matter anyway 
[03:01:57] <Decker> could wish there was more support for fsincos assembly instruction in higher level languages
[03:02:29] <InPhase> Decker: sin/cos can potentially be done in a vectorized manner with smart optimization, and there are non-vectorized op-codes for it already which are not too bad.  When you switch over to a lookup table with a big set of data, then you're cache-competing with the memory that stores the data.

I've poked at optimization boundaries for long enough to watch the general rules flip around many times as they keep modifying processors, cache systems, and strategies used on processors.

[10:42:13] <quazimodo> something really strange has happened
[10:42:45] <apotheon> Again?
[10:42:52] <quazimodo> early on in my career I understood BDD to be a testing approach, a modification on TDD where the tests were written as specifications & only tested the public interface of _anything_ 
[10:42:59] <quazimodo> a small function to an entire app (e2e)
[10:43:34] *** Joins: Serpent7776 (~Serpent77@90-156-31-193.internetia.net.pl)
[10:43:45] <apotheon> okay
[10:43:54] <quazimodo> somehow I have come to believe that the general TDD approach was to implement at test for each step of development, and that implementation was often tested (such as testing of private methods)
[10:44:19] <quazimodo> where bdd came along & said 'test it by shoving something into it & see what comes out, or what gets changed in state, or what gets a message sent to it'
[10:44:25] <quazimodo> forget testing the implementation
[10:44:38] <quazimodo> so
[10:45:04] <quazimodo> articles & people nowadays appear to me to be saying that BDD is infact not that, but rather an approach to E2E testing using cucumber
[10:45:41] <quazimodo> the 2 things that appear to be the most emphasised are 1) it tests user interface, something to do with _user_ behaviour, and 2) it uses plain english a la cucumber/gherkin
[10:45:57] * deniska frantically googles "BDD" not to fall behind the curve
[10:46:11] <quazimodo> and that's just not what I undrestood it to be, although using cucumber/gherkin to test user interfaces is certainly within scope of a BDD practice
[10:46:34] <quazimodo> deniska: it's only important if you're managing teams of people & need to communicate effectively
[10:47:10] <quazimodo> in practice I and all my devs all actually just write behavioural unit tests, mock/double away integrations where we can & do interface tests using cucumber
[10:47:29] <apotheon> I think BDD should more reasonably be treated as specifications for anything that should ideally remain constant.
[10:48:12] <quazimodo> apotheon: where do you get that from?
[10:48:20] <apotheon> . . . so, for instance, a library object's API should be specified using BDD, but a private method that is subject to change without altering the API doesn't necessarily require a spec.
[10:48:29] <quazimodo> the original paper by dan, who coined the term BDD, uses java classes as examples
[10:48:38] <quazimodo> apotheon: oh right
[10:48:43] <quazimodo> yeah see that makes perfect sense to me
[10:49:37] <quazimodo> to me BDD is used to describe the public interface of _anything_
[10:50:08] <apotheon> BDD doesn't even necessarily need Cucumber-like testing language, but that language can be very helpful for reasoning about the tests, which is why Cucumber-like testing frameworks are generally called BDD frameworks.
[10:50:13] <quazimodo> more to the point, BDD tests were also things that I did the development cycle of write test, make it green, move to next spec/test
[10:50:43] <apotheon> You should be doing that with unit tests, too: red/green/refactor.
[10:50:43] <quazimodo> it seems like 'web dev world' has hijacked the concept to mean 'tests that simulate a user hitting the web page'
[10:50:51] <apotheon> (except you left out the refactoring in yours)
[10:51:08] *** Joins: kenanmarasli (~kenanmara@user/kenanmarasli)
[10:51:12] <quazimodo> apotheon: in your mind are the unit tests different than BDD?
[10:51:18] <apotheon> Well . . . there's little we can do about JavaScript kids getting things wrong.

[10:51:44] <quazimodo> to me the unit tests were naturally part of BDD, I wrote unit tests that represented the desired behaviour for a thing and then implemented it to make the test green, and yes refactor 
[10:52:01] <quazimodo> those unit tests all made up the spec of the public api of my /thing/
[10:52:08] <apotheon> Unit tests can be part of BDD; my phrasing was sloppy when I said "unit tests".
[10:52:13] *** Quits: flakland (~flaknet99@32.211.211.39) (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:52:19] <quazimodo> when the private implementation got too hairy for that to work I refactored into separate apis
[10:52:25] *** Joins: flakland (~flaknet99@32.211.211.39)
[10:52:33] <apotheon> When people set out to do unit testing without reference to BDD, they often include testing things like private methods, too.
[10:53:18] <quazimodo> this is precisely what I understood
[10:53:20] <apotheon> (stuff BDD should ideally not care to test)
[10:53:23] <quazimodo> BDD was a sort of culture
[10:53:29] <apotheon> yep
[10:53:36] <quazimodo> a professional practice over the top of whatever type of test you were writing
[10:53:42] *** Joins: cm007magnum (~Rheanna@101.89.150.168)
[10:54:05] <nomagno> JS is "the language of the masses". That means you can extract very little from just looking at the community, since it's insanely huge
[10:54:16] <apotheon> I haven't been employed and worked with a team in a professional dev environment for a few years, so maybe I haven't see things get to the point you seem to describe where BDD is getting weirdly redefined.
[10:54:57] <quazimodo> my frontend senior managed like 70-80 devs in china
[10:55:06] <quazimodo> his perception of bdd was E2E tests
[10:55:12] <quazimodo> BDD = E2E tests of the UI
[10:55:19] <quazimodo> and TDD = unit tests of functions
[10:55:24] <quazimodo> and testing of react components was module tests
[10:55:30] <quazimodo> weird as hell ...
[10:55:34] <apotheon> weird
[10:55:57] <apotheon> Then again, you should *see* the insane things I've encountered people asserting about "agile software development".

[10:56:21] <apotheon> . . . so maybe everything's just insane, and I happened to be lucky enough to work places where that didn't happen as much.
[10:56:52] <quazimodo> bro don't even go there
[10:57:04] <quazimodo> a bank in aus i know a bit about has 'trunk based development'
[10:57:17] <apotheon> A company that employed me until about five years ago had *great* testing culture, and the names of testing practices, strategies, and tools all made sense.
[10:57:20] <quazimodo> they have 10-15 devs _synchronously_ code review you before you get to commit
[10:57:27] <apotheon> The company had problems, but that wasn't one of them.
[10:57:29] <quazimodo> not one person there is able to deploy once per day

[13:04:34] <mrig> pretty cool though, seems pretty fundamental to me, my limits are fundamental :)
[13:04:47] <ProfSimm> mrig, it's interesting you said music theory because if our only primitive is "charge" and the time between the next impulse of "charge", then the result is a rhythm in space. And fast rhythm is perceived as a frequency of sound.
[13:04:56] <ProfSimm> mrig, this makes the universe fundamentally a song
[13:05:01] <mrig> nice
[13:05:16] <mrig> same old song been playing for eternity!
[13:05:45] <ProfSimm> I don't know if it's the same song, but there are definitely similar patterns repeating. Like a refrain
[13:05:56] <ProfSimm> I think this is why our brain likes music in the first place
[13:06:16] <ProfSimm> It's a rhythm of rhythms of rhythms of rhythms, forming a pattern of pattern of pattern of patterns
[13:06:42] <mrig> The recognition of self similarity is the basis, perhaps, of attraction.
[13:06:59] <ProfSimm> Our brain loves that. It's like "ah yes, I'm made of that, and am that, and what I take as input and what I produce as output. jam on"

[13:09:46] <kish`> user51, was she borderline?
[13:10:00] <kish`> did she tell you she loved you early on
[13:11:14] <mrig> ProfSimm though there are fascinating properties to be observed in the timing and rhythms of music.

[13:15:24] <ProfSimm> mrig, imagine a hypothetical universe, where we have bunch of particles existing non-locally. No space. Just time.

[13:16:16] <mrig> it is just a dimension, why describe it as being time:
[13:16:18] <mrig> ?
[13:16:21] <ProfSimm> mrig, each particle emits a unit impulse in rhythm. From its own perspective, it emits the impulses at "unit speed" it doesn't know what time is. But RELATIVE to another particle, there's a ratio of the rate they emit. Creating a causal order

[13:17:01] <ProfSimm> We don't know what "speed" time really is. It's all relative

[13:30:39] <ProfSimm> mrig, so you said similarities attract.
[13:31:00] <ProfSimm> mrig, and I'm thinking, the only way these timelines can differ or be similar at, is they relative "time oscillations"
[13:31:03] <ProfSimm> Their rhythm.
[13:31:18] <ProfSimm> So how do we formulate a logical algorithm for making resonating timelines get "closer"?
[13:31:20] <mrig> ProfSimm well they appear to, could just be reflections though, on a deeper level.
[13:31:31] <ProfSimm> I.e. why would they be closer.
[13:31:38] <ProfSimm> Is this the universe trying to "deduplicate" things?

[13:31:59] *** Joins: lkor (~lionkor@beammp/staff/lionkor)
[13:32:22] <mrig> perhaps there is a greater context that is it's self oscillating? The substrate is modulating.
[13:32:31] <ProfSimm> mrig, I think it'd be amazing if all electrons in the universe, are literally "linking" to the same timeline. I.e. a shared value.
[13:32:42] <ProfSimm> Basically there's one electron
[13:33:16] <mrig> Likely that they are looking collectively for the path of least resistance :)
[13:33:19] <ProfSimm> mrig, in a larger context it is self-oscillating yes. The "impulses" themselves are time oscillations and then a meta timeline oscillates those oscillations to make patterns
[13:34:05] <mrig> I do not accept your use of time here though, but essentially or conceptually am with you. 
[13:34:22] <ProfSimm> mrig, but imagine if the universe works like this this means copies of a thing is literally THE SAME THING, as in a SINGLE thing, only decorated with the instance individual differences

[14:00:12] <ProfSimm> mrig, so as you noted similarity attracts. Too much similarity though doesn't. Like having sex with your sister.
[14:00:25] <mrig> machinations require intellect where as the pursuit of a desire does not; Which then is the more likely in a context in which there is nothing physical?

[15:07:54] <ProfSimm> mrig, dude thanks to this conversation i came up with the most weird concept. I'm writing a language right now based around these concepts we discussed
[15:08:02] <ProfSimm> mrig, every expression is basically a "timeline" and so on
[15:08:07] <ProfSimm> mrig, parallel execution etc.
[15:08:55] <ProfSimm> mrig so I thought wait, when you die, some people experience flashbacks in reverse. Could time reverse, i.e. reflect off a bad ending? It's like throwing an exception.
[15:09:18] <ProfSimm> mrig but instead of bubbling up the stack, first it bubbles "back" to the branches it made in attempt to take better branches and not throw
[15:09:29] <ProfSimm> Never seen a language like this

[19:26:33] <pyzozord> a bit as if it was clay, when wet/warm it's malleable, you can shape it easier, when it solidify it becomes robust and hard but difficult to change

What I do now is put a row into SQL-db then there is a systemd-managed daemon whose threads watch SQL-db, atomically lock a row, start a subprocess, wait it, then register its outcome in db. Q: Is there any ready-made software which can accept tasks and then execute subprocesses and record their exit code to somewhere?

[23:49:52] <nomagno> I need to have a series of functions depend on a single struct do store pretty much anything they can need (even for internal calculations). The issue is I need to fix the struct's interface right now, but don't know exactly how complex I need to make the functions. Is 40 ints, 40 chars, 10 null pointers, and 10 char pointers, reasonable?

[23:52:43] <nomagno> What I am basically asking is, if I need to have a pseudo-stack with a fixed interface in the form of a struct, what is a reasonable way to partition and limit it?
[23:52:44] <nomagno> I'm thinking perhaps something like 4KBs of storage partitioned between different types of pointers and numbers

[23:54:02] <InPhase> nomagno: You can use a polymorphic base class for which templated subclasses can contain arbitrary storage, all with type safety, and use polymorphic dispatch to perform the final execution step using whatever parameters are stored in the subclass.  But then at the same time, pointers to the base class can be consolidated into a single container.
[23:56:30] <nomagno> InPhase: the fact that there can be no difference between types at runtime doesn't mean I don't have to figure out the most convenient variable partition for e.g. 4KBs in C
[23:57:12] <InPhase> nomagno: You really don't want to be doing things this dynamic in C if you can at all help it.  This is the sort of use case that modern features in C++ were invented for.
[23:57:18] <jeaye> InPhase: i.e. std::any

[23:58:06] <InPhase> jeaye: std::tuple and some sort of virtual void Run(); is what I usually use when doing this.
[23:58:35] <InPhase> Or equivalent with other customized types.
[23:59:05] <jeaye> I just mean that std::any is a container of a polymorphic base class which is derived by a templated class which contains the full type info.
[23:59:27] <jeaye> The exact type erasure pattern you described.
[23:59:46] <jeaye> Boy, I don't miss C++ though.
[23:59:57] <InPhase> Yeah, but you have to then do some sort of manual type inspection to figure out what's stored in the any to make use of it.  Polymorphism bundles the behavior as self-managed.
