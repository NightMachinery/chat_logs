[00:13:52] <TML> vms14: it all depends on what your role is; for example, I don't bother with XDebug because if we have performance problems in our PHP code, that means our CDN and appcache layers have catastrophically failed to do their job; however, I'm sure my developers probably are using XDebug on their own machines.
[00:15:49] <vms14> TML what do you use to help you finding bugs in your code?
[00:16:10] <vms14> I'm trying to use geben which is for using xdebug in emacs
[00:16:47] <vms14> for some reason expected 9000 port and xdebug was in 9003, now changed it and seems to work but not as it should
[00:18:51] <TML> vms14: Unit tests and log files
[00:19:27] <vms14> so it's a waste of time to use it unless I have a specific use case?
[00:20:51] <vms14> it's weird cause I thought people would ecourage the use of xdebug
[00:21:03] <vms14> encourage*

[00:22:15] <da_wunder> vms14: xdebug is great for _debugging_ your code - that doesn't really check if your code is valid
[00:22:49] <da_wunder> vms14: for validating your code I would recommend you to use static analyzers like ECS, PHPStan and Psalm
[00:23:01] <vms14> linters
[00:23:11] <da_wunder> those aren't just a linters
[00:27:07] <TML> vms14: You don't consider the fact that I'm paying Derick a monthly stipend to continue developing XDebug as encouraging the use of XDebug?
[00:27:25] <TML> I literally said: xdebug is a tool I think "should" exist, whether or not I actually leverage it myself
[00:28:37] <TML> vms14: I don't use xdebug because in my role I don't have any occasion to be doing runtime debugging of behaviour. By the time the code gets to me, it's running on dozens (if not hundreds) of servers, many of which I don't have authority to do XDebug operations on.
[00:29:35] <da_wunder> vms14: and I really hope that you don't run xdebug on your production servers
[00:29:50] <vms14> I have no production server
[00:30:13] <vms14> and if I have will be a cheap shared hosting xD
[00:30:48] <da_wunder> and then I really hope that you don't run xdebug on that "cheap hosting"
[00:30:53] <TML> vms14: I _only_ have production servers
[00:31:01] <vms14> I'm learning php and I think get used to xdebug right on the start could be fine
[00:31:29] <TML> The non-production stuff is a different team.
[00:31:41] <da_wunder> I would recommend you to learn the basics first
[00:31:54] <vms14> as long as I want to use php in the long term xdebug and other tools are handy to learn about
[00:31:57] <__adrian> xdebug is useful for watching how things work (e.g., a complex system you're not familiar with). and when you have some weird case you can't even, it can be good then too.
[00:32:14] <__adrian> but if it's a day-to-day tool, you have problems.
[00:32:36] <da_wunder> ^
[00:32:44] <__adrian> in systems i'm familiar with, i almost never find any need for it.
[00:32:54] <da_wunder> same here
[00:33:13] <__adrian> also dude don't put xdebug on a production server
[00:33:19] <da_wunder> I only use xdebug to debug some really weird error case on my projects

[03:29:14] <vms14> I didn't see that link if you posted it before
[03:29:56] <vms14> but actually what I'm trying is some dirty php generation cause I had an html generator in lisp
[03:30:37] <vms14> (php (here-fun 'path_link '($href $path)
[03:30:37] <vms14>           (a :href '$href '$path)))

[03:33:04] <vms14> super dirty, but if I start generating more php from lisp code could end being nice

[03:42:00] <vms14> cause I could end using lisp to generate php, php has some benefits lisp does not has, specially in the web environment
[03:42:01] <TML> If you want to write Lisp, write your webapps in Lisp - why go the long-distance route of writing Lisp to autogenerate PHP?
[03:42:09] <TML> vms14: Such as?
[03:42:21] <vms14> such as omnipresence and job market
[03:42:38] <vms14> I won't get a job writing lisp code
[03:42:48] <TML> vms14: But if you're doing this for "job market" reasons, writing autogenerators in Lisp isn't going to help you get a PHP job
[03:42:54] <vms14> If I want to work with lisp I have to create a startup
[03:43:03] <TML> Well, that's provably false
[03:43:04] <vms14> no, but learning php will do
[03:43:33] <TML> vms14: Writing Lisp to generate PHP code won't get you a PHP coding job.
[03:43:42] <vms14> that's right
[03:43:55] <TML> So again: Why go through the Lisp to generate PHP step?
[03:44:05] <TML> if you want a PHP job, write PHP
[03:44:15] <TML> If you want to write in Lisp, don't write Lisp to generate PHP
[03:44:16] <vms14> my goal wasn't use lisp, but yet it's a thing I always secretly wanted (mix php css and html)

[03:49:27] <Blondie101010> hmmmm, there's a basic thing you don't get...  hold on
[03:50:04] <Blondie101010> the php engine parses the script looking for <?php opening and closing tags, and outputs the rest
[03:50:15] <Blondie101010> so you can put it inside anything
[03:50:40] <Blondie101010> that happens long before your front end stuff is done
[03:50:48] <vms14> yes, I just need to put (php "stuff")
[03:51:34] <Blondie101010> it might be a good idea to look at SOLID principles
[03:52:10] <vms14> I need to get a way to retrieve values and handle input
[03:52:26] <Blondie101010> sure
[03:52:32] <Blondie101010> you do that, then you output
[03:52:43] <Blondie101010> !+php first
[03:52:43] <php-bot> your PHP code can be sorted into two categories: code which _performs work_ (processing input, controller logic, database access, error handling, etc.), and code which  _produces output_ (header(), echo, <?= $var ?>, plain ol' <html>, etc.). work goes FIRST. output goes LAST. https://gist.github.com/adrian-enspired/9ed2542a695e2ebe30aa

[21:42:34] <znf> well, this looks really bad - PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught : Call to undefined function define()
[21:42:46] <Albright> lol
[21:43:21] <Albright> Looks like define() was added in PHP 4. Are you using PHP 3 perhaps?
[21:43:31] <znf> No, 7.4 lol
[21:43:55] <judah> define(define, function(name, what) { define(name, what); });
[21:43:59] <judah> should work like a charm
[21:44:00] <judah> lol
[21:45:38] <da_wunder> znf: could you share your code, and even better if you create an example to 3v4l.org site
[21:46:00] <znf> da_wunder, it's not the code being the issue
[21:46:04] <znf> it's just plain wordpress
[21:46:10] <znf> well, "plain"
[21:46:21] <judah> ew
[21:46:59] <znf> we have LiteSpeed under cPanel for this specific client, and every now and then his PHP completely crashes
[21:47:46] <znf> Only this client on that specific server, and I'm honestly baffled as to WHY
[21:48:31] <znf> We've disabled opcache for the moment, to see if that was the culprit, but that's obviously not optimal
[21:48:45] <da_wunder> if you get that "PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught : Call to undefined function define()" error - you should see the stacktrace of that error and see where that is actually happening
[21:49:15] *** Joins: forgotmynick (uid24625@id-24625.hampstead.irccloud.com)
[21:49:49] <znf> We can "easily" fix the issue when it happens by just... killing all the users' processes
[21:49:55] <lembron> maybe some stupid security-thing setting disable_functions? - only idea id have from just php itself hitting the shitter cause something corrupted somewhere
[21:50:08] <Albright> Yeah, that's what I was about to suggest
[21:50:16] <da_wunder> yep
[21:50:19] <Albright> Maybe someone got zealous there.
[21:50:34] <Albright> Although isn't the error message different when you try to use one of those functions?
[21:50:45] <znf> We do have Imunify 360 running, but that doesn't log any incident for the specific client when it happens
[21:51:10] <znf> We also succesfully use imunify360 for hundreds of users on other servers, so I'm not very quick to blame that
[21:51:23] <lembron> i know safemode and there like prints a distinct error, but never used disable_functions anywhere so no idea...
[21:51:49] <znf> nah, it's not disabling functions
[21:53:10] <znf> It's also incredibly hard to debug as the environment of cPanel is quite complex
[21:57:22] <lembron> disable_functions is a ini-only value anyhow it seems, so shouldnt be some accidential-sticky runtime config ye...
[22:04:05] <znf> One of my contacts basically says "it happens when the PHP process crashes internally without actually crashing fully - it usually comes if an account has hit it's resource limits (even for just a second)"
[22:04:28] <znf> But this damn account has 10GB RAM allocated
[22:04:50] <znf> and it averages 1-1.5GB usage
