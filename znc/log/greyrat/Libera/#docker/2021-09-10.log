[00:26:19] <luva> I have manually downloaded new images for most of my containers... Is there a command which makes all of my containers that have new images recreate?
[00:26:20] <programmerq> with a third party tool, yes. https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower does this
[00:26:35] <luva> Will look into that thanks programmerq
[00:26:43] <programmerq> if you use docker-compose, you can do workflows like docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
[00:27:32] <luva> so theres a difference between using docker pull and docker-compose pull ?
[00:28:33] <programmerq> docker-compose pull attempts to download any images in a given docker-compose.yml file, but it's quite similar to docker pull. The thing that actually recreates containers if there's a newer image is the docker-compose up -d part.
[00:28:50] <programmerq> it'll see that the existing containers have the old image and recreate them with the newer one
[00:29:24] <luva> thats cool thank you
[00:29:47] <devslash-> I wrote a python script that I use to build docker containers easily. It assumes that you have 1 directory with all of your compose files in them. When you run it, it shows you a menu where you pick the service, then the action which is build,stop,stop & delete,stop, delete & rebuild and it automatically runs the docker commands to remove and rebuild a container
[00:29:48] <programmerq> in my opinion, the watchtower pattern is a bit of an antipattern. I'd say use compose or swarm mode or k8s and take advantage of their more intelligent container lifecycle management
[00:30:14] <luva> I have all my compose files in portainer
[00:30:42] <luva> but I just wrote a script that pulls images for all containers I have, then adterwards I can just use the docker-compose up -d I gues
[00:31:02] <luva> ah no cant do that, apparently needs to have the compose files

[00:38:16] <luva> devslash- , So then I could use your script you mean?
[00:46:12] <devslash-> yes let me get the link from Github
[00:48:29] <devslash-> https://github.com/SegiH/pyManageContainers
[00:49:38] <devslash-> if you want to run this python script from a different directory than the one with the compose scripts in it, change the path on line 8 to point to the right path

[01:58:12] <another|> Hi, the Dockerfile reference says "FROM <image>" can be "any valid image". What constituts a valid image name?
[01:58:14] <another|> https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from
[01:59:44] <echelon> an image you already have locally
[01:59:48] <echelon> or on docker hub
[02:04:06] <another|> How can I reference images from different registries? is docker.io/debian valid?
[02:10:47] <devslash-> I believe that you can reference the url when pulling the image

[02:24:42] <echelon> it would look like.. FROM account_name/image:tag
[02:28:10] <devslash-> yes
[02:30:01] <another|> I want to explicitly reference the registry since hub.docker.com is not the default in other oci tools
[02:30:45] <another|> Apparently docker.io is the answer
[02:32:17] <devslash-> so I think you can do docker.io/account_name/image:tag
[02:32:55] <another|> That's what the docs say, yes. https://docs.docker.com/registry/introduction/#understanding-image-naming

[20:12:20] <alguien> Hi. Docker noob here. As I understand docker can have different uids and gids than host (which is why a tutor will say to chown using 0:999, rather than root:postgres). If a file is mapped into a volume (am I using these words correctly?), it will use its uid:guid, but will interpret them differently is that right? So what to a host may appear as root:systemd-coredump may appear to the image, and be used as, root:postgres?
[20:18:37] <OsteHovel> Yes, but the uid and guid numberical form will be the same
[20:19:00] <tianon> alguien: correct -- the actual underlying _numbers_ used between the two are the same (999 on the host is 999 in the container, unless you're using user namespaces / rootless containers), but the names are arbitrary and come from "/etc/passwd" / "/etc/group" in the environment (the kernel itself never cares about/reads those)

[22:24:17] <Shaun> I’d strongly recommend their own images too.  it’s enough of a beast to get running in the first place, let alone straying from the path.  not that you’ll get any support from gitlab, but at least this way you can google for the scratchings of some other madman who’s stuck in the same  place you are

[23:33:36] <Razva> hi. I have this `docker-compose.yml` file: http://sprunge.us/IVJ1PW . The documentation specifies that I should start `docker-compose` by executing `docker run --network=<project-name>_default -p 8001:8001 --volume=/docker/erpnext/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf -d nginx`. Can't I add the variables in the `yml` file?
[23:33:59] *** Quits: irrgit (~irrgit@192.241.175.183) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:34:15] <tang^> that... doesn't sound right at all
[23:34:28] <Razva> yes, I just noticed.
[23:34:38] <Razva> because it's a docker `run` not docker-compose.
[23:34:44] <tang^> yeah, that
[23:34:46] <Razva> let me re-re-read the dpcs.
[23:34:48] <Razva> *docs
[23:35:49] <Razva> Ah, ok, I get it. So basically I need to run NGINX first. Ok, so I guess that I can do a docker-compose for `docker run --network=<project-name>_default -p 8001:8001 --volume=/docker/erpnext/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf -d nginx` as well?
[23:36:17] <tang^> sure, I have nginx under a docker-compose for one of my projects
[23:36:36] <tang^> in fact, that docker-compose you have already could easily have the nginx service configured for you
[23:37:49] <Razva> exactly what I'm thinking right now :)
[23:40:43] <Razva> can you let me know how can I translate `--network=<project-name>_default` into `docker-compose` format?
[23:41:25] <Razva> basically I need to run the container in the `erp_default` network
[23:43:56] <Razva> I think I solved it: https://paste.debian.net/1211296/
[23:44:12] <Razva> @tang^ can you please be so kind and take a fast look?
[23:45:52] <tang^> looks reasonable
[23:46:04] <tang^> is erp_default already configured?

[23:52:09] <Razva> ERROR: Service "erpnext-public-nginx" uses an undefined network "erp_default"
[23:52:26] <Razva> so I need to create it into the compose file as well
[23:52:34] <tang^> yes
[23:53:13] *** Joins: tex (~super@user/dix)
[23:53:19] <Razva> ok, no idea how to do that :\
[23:54:14] <Razva> I guess that I need to define `networks:` ? should I add them at the top?
[23:55:51] <tang^> whatever the specification says: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/
[23:56:07] <Razva> hmmm
[23:56:14] <Razva> `Creating network "erp_erp_default" with the default driver
[23:56:14] <Razva> Creating network "erp_default" with the default driver`
[23:58:24] <Razva> basically the `erp_default` is already getting created
[23:58:59] <tang^> oh your project is named erp?
[23:59:11] <tang^> then you don't actually need to specify a network in the compose
