[00:00:41] <bumblefuzz> so, another issue has cropped up
[00:01:10] <bumblefuzz> the resolution has changed for some reason on my ubuntu machine
[00:01:39] <bumblefuzz> I got modeline and am trying to do `xrandr --newmode "1920x1080_120.00"  369.50  1920 2080 2288 2656  1080 1083 1088 1160 -hsync +vsync`
[00:01:54] <bumblefuzz> but it keeps saying Can't open display
[00:01:59] <bumblefuzz> I've tried sudo
[00:02:02] <bumblefuzz> nothing helps
[00:02:06] <bumblefuzz> any ideas?

[00:26:36] <TJ-> bumblefuzz: the kernel driver is there "nvidia" but your xrandr output is not showing any physical output ports (VGa, HDMI, DVI, etc.) so I /think/ there's a problem with the Xorg nvidia driver
[00:26:41] <bumblefuzz> another weird thing: ctrl+alt+T doesn't work!
[00:26:48] <bumblefuzz> I have to manually open terminal
[00:26:58] <bumblefuzz> how does all this break all of a sudden?
[00:27:07] <TJ-> bumblefuzz: therefore X is using software rendering, hence only the 'default' output listed by xrandr
[00:27:33] <bumblefuzz> interesting interpretation
[00:27:34] <TJ-> bumblefuzz: which Ubuntu flavour are you using? pure Ubuntu, Xubuntu, ?
[00:27:39] <bumblefuzz> Kubuntu

[04:40:12] <xMopx> i just did a dist-upgrade and it was renamed to eth0 which was annoying because it broke my network config
[04:40:18] <xMopx> not a big deal to fix, but why did it change?
[04:41:44] <xMopx> it's a bare metal install so i am certain the MAC didn't change

[04:44:31] <sixwheeledbeast> it shouldn't have changed from the above.
[04:46:31] <xMopx> fwiw i originally installed the box on 14.04 and have been upgrading it over time
[04:46:42] <xMopx> but it was 20.04 before and after the problem upgrade
[04:46:48] <sixwheeledbeast> they should be fixed "Predictable Names" MAC address wouldn't be used unless set manually

[04:52:07] <tomreyn> xMopx: do you know how the name "p119p1" was assigned originally?
[04:52:18] <sixwheeledbeast> p119p1 doesn't sound right. Maybe it fell back to classic eth0 for some reason?
[04:52:46] <xMopx> tomreyn: no more details besides that it was assigned automatically when i installed the original os
[04:52:56] <xMopx> i recall being annoyed it *wasnt* called eth0 at the time, heh
[04:53:31] <tomreyn> was it running on bare metal back then as well?
[04:53:34] <xMopx> yes
[04:53:51] <xMopx> hm, possibly a different motherboard, but definitely the same model of motherboard
[04:53:57] <tomreyn> hmm, weird, i can't think of why it would have taken this name in the old naming scheme either.
[04:54:07] <xMopx> certainly a replacement motherboard, now that I think about it
[04:54:23] <xMopx> however, that was years ago and probably when i was on 16.04 or 18.04
[04:56:38] <tomreyn> https://samiux.blogspot.com/2015/07/howto-protect-my-home-network-with.html "Since the network interfaces of Asrock Rack C2750D4I are Intel i210, the name of the interfaces on Ubuntu 14.04 is p119p1 and p121p1."
[04:57:33] <tomreyn> chances are you were using a network interface driver provided by intel then, maybe because there was no in kernel support for those NICs, yet
[04:57:39] <xMopx> that's my exact motherboard
[04:57:43] <xMopx> ahha
[04:58:00] <tomreyn> vendior drivers may sometimes assign weird names to NICs
[04:58:50] <tomreyn> other than meaning you'll need to search and replace your firewall script, is there other impact now that it was renamed?
[05:00:20] <tomreyn> the goal of the new naming scheme is to provide stability from hereon, so that those network interfaces will always have the same name, for the same interface, even with multiple interfaces managed by the same driver, with ever reboot.
[05:01:36] *** Joins: ax562 (~ax562@user/ax562)
[05:02:07] <tomreyn> i see how it's bad that a non release upgrade applied the new naming scheme, i'm not sure why that would have happened. maybe you're on the HWE kernel and got a newer kernel which now supports this interface.
[05:02:08] <xMopx> no impact besides my network config file
[05:02:20] <xMopx> i've got a second identical box to do next, though :)

[05:07:50] <tomreyn> biosdevname is a remainder from 14.04, i think

[05:08:34] <xMopx> ah that sounds like the relevant package haha
[05:08:37] <tomreyn> none of these packages are available from any of the currently configured (on your respective systems) apt repositories
[05:09:05] <xMopx> i've been doing `dist-upgrade` somewhat regularly, why did it stick around until now?
[05:09:48] <tomreyn> you probably had a semi failed do-release-upgrade at some point. when this happens, packages aren't cleaned up in the end.
[05:10:13] <xMopx> that sounds right, 18.04 to 20.04 was rough
[05:10:53] <tomreyn> or maybe some of those packages were just missed (i.e. release upgrade bug) on 14.04 -> 16.04, and those packages weren't actually removed by do-release-upgrade

[16:24:48] <manwhowouldbekin> Greetings, all. I seem to have messed up my Ubuntu 20.04 system to the point of where fixing it is beyond my knowledge. Is this a good place to ask some technical questions about troubleshooting issues?
[16:24:56] <tomreyn> BinarySavior: gnome-shell/mutter and even gdm run X under a restricted user account (and both default to xwayland since Ubuntu 21.04, previously just gdm does; all of this is unless you are using nvidia proprietary graphics drivers) whereas sddm/kde (plasma) still run Xorg as root (as far as i know). each have a massive stack of dependencies, and diufferent ones.
[16:25:37] <tomreyn> manwhowouldbekin: you've some to a good place for this.
[16:26:13] <tomreyn> manwhowouldbekin: start by describing what doe snot work as expected, what may have caused it, what you have done so far in an attempt to fix it.
[16:26:50] <manwhowouldbekin> tomteyn: I actually wrote up an issue on Ask Ubuntu on it. Would a link help?

[16:37:32] <tomreyn> this would never happen unless you mixed apt repositories made for different ubuntu releases: "I encountered some issues with package libc6 being version 2.31 instead of 2.33"

[16:38:27] <manwhowouldbekin> tomereyn: Yeah, I was definitely in over my head there.
[16:39:09] <tomreyn> each ubuntu release uses exactly one version of libc6, whichever kernel version you have installed or whatever. "focal" (20.04 LTS) uses 2.31

[18:37:07] <hendry> hi, I've noticed in Github workflows "apt install" https://github.com/tclssg/tclssg/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml ... shouldn't it be `apt-get install`??
[18:37:30] <TJ-> hendry: no, 'apt' is the 'human friendly' front-end whereas apt-get is for scripts
[18:37:43] <manwhowouldbekin> TJ-: https://termbin.com/ck5bm
[18:38:02] <TJ-> hendry: or in other words, apt output can't be reliably parsed because it may change, but apt-get guarantees its output will be consistent
[18:38:36] <tomreyn> TJ-: but ubuntu-drivers is *not* just for nvidia drivers, and there are other drivers it would manage, which have no 'series version', e.g. "backport-iwlwifi-dkms", so i assume 'driver' really refers to the apt package name, and 'version' really refers to the apt package version. i am guessing, though.
[18:38:36] <TJ-> manwhowouldbekin: aha, not installed, just added. "sudo dkms install nvidia/470.57.0"
[18:38:46] <hendry> TJ-: i see, thanks

[18:41:16] <manwhowouldbekin> TJ-: So when a new kernel is installed, it does it autoamtically? Hence, the same source code of NVIDIA should theoretically work on a newer kernel?

[23:29:13] <manwhowouldbekin> TJ-: Got it. In general, what's the benefit of keeping up with the changes? Is it in getting the most recent changes and bug fixes?

[23:32:31] <manwhowouldbekin> TJ-: What's the typical lag between what's currently cutting edge in the repo and what is released officially by Ubuntu?
[23:33:41] <TJ-> manwhowouldbekin: well, security fixes get backported almost immediately, but each ubuntu release settles on a specific versions and sticks with it. We introduced the HardWare Enablement kernels to provide more recent kernels to older releases since LTSes are supported for 5 years+
[23:34:02] <TJ-> HWEs come from a newer ubuntu release and are installable on the older releases
