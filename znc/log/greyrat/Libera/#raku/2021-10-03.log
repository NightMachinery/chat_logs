[02:07:02] <raydiak> it's a step up from the hazardous pin-dropping that silence tends to evoke around here. although ... does look like three marbles on the ground
[02:09:42] <moon-child> |||
[02:10:04] <moon-child> ^ pins dropped onto the ground.  Standing on end.  Somehow.  (Probably because of all the angels)
[02:12:19] * raydiak rolls a magnet rake around the room
[02:14:56] <raydiak> just between #perl6 and #raku, I count somewhere around 31 dropped pins in lizmat's log, and around 21 of them are from lizmat...
[02:36:39] <raydiak> lizmat: have you considered exposing a public api to the chat logs? seems like mostly it'd just be having it respond at a different url with json templates instead of html
[02:38:40] <raydiak> from looking at the get params, I'd change how the paging controls are exposed, but everything else seems pretty straightforward
[02:45:50] <raydiak> I mean the paging controls and cgi params in the search results. the browsing urls are pretty straightforward

[03:12:07] <timo> ohey raydiak have you continued measuring performance of your ray tracer? new-disp just landed, after all, so that could be interesting
[03:12:33] <raydiak> lizmat: nevermind, it looks like you already have a facility for it in place, except at .json urls I get a 404 with no content
[03:13:16] <raydiak> timo: hi! no, I haven't but that's a good idea. last time I checked, many years ago, all the time was mainly spent creating and destroying objects
[03:20:36] <timo> ah, interesting. the already-existing work in PEA, partial escape analysis, will be able to get around building short-lifetime objects
[03:22:32] <raydiak> I thought it's probably a flaw of my design, since I wasn't thinking much about optimization when I initially wrote it. considered refactoring it to reduce as much as possible to a vector pipeline, so I could "compile" the scene file into a routine or few before rendering, maybe using math::symbolic
[03:23:04] <raydiak> but yes even if it's not optimal, in some ways that just makes it a better stress test, so doing a little comparison might be cool
[03:26:34] <raydiak> new-disp landed on master? and 2021.09 is right before we did that, right?
[03:28:53] <raydiak> and does new-disp still require a env var set, or will it use the new compiler front end by default now?

[03:47:06] <[Coke]> anyone know how to make rakubrew build with a triple of "latest everything" ?
[03:47:49] <[Coke]> raydiak: it's landed, it's the default
[03:49:44] <[Coke]> https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/issues/2627 - this ticket should be moved to problem solving
[03:53:34] <timo> raydiak: you may be confusing new-disp with rakuast
[03:54:04] <raydiak> oh, you're right. I am
[03:58:35] <raydiak> in a first quick informal test, 2021.09 was at 1m 24s and master is at 1m 7s
[03:59:17] <japhb> \o/
[03:59:21] <japhb> Nice to see
[04:00:26] <timo> cool
[04:01:08] <raydiak> yes, a very substantial gain. I'm testing again with 4x the pixels. and this is a laptop, I ran 2021.09 first. so any thermal advantage would have been there
[04:05:39] <raydiak> 2021.09: 65536 pixels / 5 mins 47 secs 476.58 ms = 188.61 pixels/sec
