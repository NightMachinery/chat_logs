[15:03:17] <Agiofws> hello is it good to know javascript  to start learning php?
[15:03:30] <da_wunder> that is not needed
[15:04:10] <da_wunder> but generally if you're going to do some web development sooner or later you will need some javascript skills
[15:04:11] <Agiofws> ok because w3schools recommends  html,css, and javascript
[15:04:25] <Robdgreat> w3schools is garbage
[15:04:29] <da_wunder> ^
[15:05:30] <Agiofws> well  its a nice crash course if you're trying to do something quickly... have gone through html and css tutorials ...
[15:05:47] <da_wunder> and generally if you're doing web development you will need to know basics of html, css and javascript aren't needed at the start - but you will need those both sooner or later
[15:06:18] * Agiofws is trying to implement an oauth2 client  on a wordpress site
[15:06:49] <Agiofws> just hope i'll not have to code my own plugin or  theme ...
[15:07:28] <Robdgreat> that would be astonishing. I'd expect there to be no way an oauth2 client for wp doesn't already exist
[15:07:39] <Agiofws> ok thanks
[15:07:55] <Robdgreat> I mean, have you not gone looking yet?
[15:09:29] <Agiofws> it does but they have default option for  well know auth2 server like google or facebook  no custom server or even if i have an option for a custom server i remember not having an option atleast a free one to insert my custom redirect url...  so it it would not work

[15:11:34] <Robdgreat> why are you talking about javascript?
[15:12:48] <Agiofws> i assume that  some plugins use javascript aswell i don't know for sure
[15:13:10] <Robdgreat> an oauth client should be all php
[15:13:30] <Agiofws> ok then ...:)   p
[15:13:48] <Agiofws> probably i'll use curl php  with post a get methods ...
[15:14:15] <Robdgreat> ok
[15:15:24] <Agiofws> how can i check what version of php my  lamp server uses ?
[15:15:56] <Robdgreat> php -v
[15:16:00] <da_wunder> eg. create info.php with contents like `<?php phpinfo();` and just open that file in your browser
[15:16:27] <da_wunder> php -v gives you version of CLI php, and that might be different one versus that what your webserver is using

[17:44:30] <__adrian> tip: `quoting` column names is never bad
[17:50:10] <netstar> is it standard practice to include/require a file which sets the include path so that all subsequent includes/requires can refer to the base directory of your code?

[18:01:10] <da_wunder> second tip, that PhpOffice library is quite slow and it eats memory a lot - I would recommend to use this library instead - https://github.com/box/spout
[18:01:50] <up_running> You mean switch PHPSpreadsheet for Spout, yes?
[18:01:58] <da_wunder> yes
[18:02:02] <up_running> I will research bindings right now. one sec please

[18:02:51] <up_running> is a fix for the variable issue included in the bindings recommendation?
[18:03:11] <up_running> I'll share the error
[18:03:27] <da_wunder> you could add that to that same gist
[18:04:44] <up_running> You mean share the error pic in a comment?
[18:05:11] <da_wunder> share that error stacktrace
[18:05:32] <up_running> Ah, so, share the entire error in a comment then?
[18:05:42] <da_wunder> it's a text - no need to share some images
[18:06:36] <up_running> Ok, I just shared the error text in a comment.
[18:07:18] <da_wunder> and that error message is quite clear - you don't have that table in your database
[18:08:36] <up_running> But there's no table mentioned on line 45 or in the code that I can see
[18:09:21] <da_wunder> that error is coming from line 45, where you're executing your SQL
[18:09:28] <da_wunder> read that error once again
[18:09:45] <da_wunder> "Fatal error: Uncaught mysqli_sql_exception: Table 'site_db.columns' doesn't exist"
[18:10:08] <up_running> Yes, but where is 'site_db.columns' mentioned in the code?
[18:10:19] <up_running> I did a search for it and I don't see it anywhere
[18:10:23] <da_wunder> line 43...
[18:11:13] <up_running> Where is the text 'site_db.columns' on line 43?
[18:11:31] <da_wunder> "insert into Columns"
[18:11:52] <up_running> Huh? I must be misunderstanding something here then.
[18:12:11] <da_wunder> your database connection is using that `site_db` database, and that database doesn't have that `columns` table
[18:12:14] <up_running> How is "insert into Columns" the same as 'site_db.colums'?
[18:12:55] <up_running> so, I need to reference my db connection php file, then?
[18:13:21] <up_running> ok, I just checked it and now I finally see your meaning.
[18:14:03] <da_wunder> you're already doing that `mysqli_query($conn,$sql);` there is that `$conn` variable, which is most likely set in your `db_connection.php` which you require on line 8
[18:14:52] <up_running> da_wunder: I think I see your meaning now. This was discussed at work, but since I'm new, I forgot.
[18:15:41] <up_running> The column names have to present in the database *before* I attempt to run a script to input data.
[18:16:34] <da_wunder> the table needs to be in your database before you try to run that, and that table must have at least those columns that you're using
[18:18:13] <up_running> ok, well, this might take a bit of time since I need to read up on how to create a table in mysql
[18:18:35] <da_wunder> should not be so hard
[18:18:44] <up_running> at my internship, i've been using Heidisql, but in the book I'm using to learn PHP & MySQL, I think I'm using something else
[18:19:04] <da_wunder> use eg. heidisql tool to connect to your database server and with that tool you could easily create new table to your database
[18:19:37] <up_running> well, yes, i could do that, but I just don't want to deviate from the book if possible
[18:20:06] <up_running> but I'll be right back as soon as I read up on this and figure out how to add a table
[18:20:08] <da_wunder> and that book is what?
[18:20:42] <up_running> "PHP & MySQL in Easy Steps" by Mike McGrath.
[18:21:44] <up_running> I'm currently on the second chapter before the "Producing arrays" section.
[18:21:57] <__adrian> heidi is a tool that connects to various databases. it is not a database itself.
[18:22:04] <da_wunder> that is quite old book...
[18:22:28] <da_wunder> 10 years old - a lot have changed after that
[18:22:31] <up_running> Yes, but I read it is one of the best for complete beginners, so I chose it.
[18:22:51] <up_running> I would like to get Duckett's new book, but I don't have the funds just yet.
[18:23:22] <up_running> and Duckett's new book isn't available in electronic format so that's not good also.
[18:23:26] *** Quits: nixoeen (~nixoeen@user/nixoeen) (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[18:23:46] <up_running> but I heard that his book is probably the best resource available for PHP and SQL.
[18:24:33] * da_wunder never heard about that book, so cannot really say
[18:25:09] <up_running> https://www.amazon.com/PHP-MySQL-Server-side-Web-Development/dp/1119149215
[18:26:16] <__adrian> up_running:  a ten-year-old book about php is definitely _not_ the best choice.
[18:26:48] <__adrian> start with php.net - this is the official manual. you _need_ to know how to read it.
[18:27:29] <__adrian> books are often out of date, wrong, or both. i'm sure there are good books out there, but i've never seen them.
[18:28:07] <up_running> __adrian: I've referenced the official manual a lot so far.
[18:28:11] <__adrian> speaking of databases... does your php book teach you to use _prepared statements_ and _parameters_?
[18:28:17] <__adrian> awesome
[18:28:23] <up_running> But I can't spend much time there since my internship is pretty short
[18:28:29] <__adrian> ?
[18:28:34] <up_running> I got in trouble last week for this reason
[18:28:34] <__adrian> that's completely backwards
[18:28:52] <da_wunder> and if you're looking for good book about coding, I would recommend this one - https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882
[18:28:55] <__adrian> your internship should be encouraging you to learn things you don't know.
[18:29:09] <__adrian> if they don't, then it's a crap internship and you should leave.
[18:29:16] <da_wunder> ^
[18:29:21] <up_running> they absolutely do, but they said if all I'm doing is researching then you don't need to be here
[18:29:32] <__adrian> that's completely wrong.
[18:29:32] <up_running> so, they encouraged me to ask more questions
[18:29:38] <__adrian> definitiely
[18:29:50] <up_running> I agree with it though. I just felt like I would be annoying at first
[18:29:52] <__adrian> but that doesn't mean you don't research things yourself when you need to.
[18:30:14] <__adrian> well, to be clear, asking questions comes _after_ you've looked into something for yourself.
[18:30:23] <__adrian> otherwise, you're only asking us to read the manual for you.
[18:30:35] <up_running> yes, I always try to read *and* solve the issue myself
[18:30:40] <__adrian> read first so you know which parts you have questions about. _then_ ask.
[18:30:54] <up_running> but they want me to use the internship time wisely and try to finish at least a single project
[18:31:04] <up_running> I can research how it works after the internship ends
[18:31:08] <__adrian> that's completely the wrong attitude  :)
[18:31:20] <da_wunder> sorry but, that doesn't look like that - you did have _clear_ error message, but you didn't understand that
[18:31:31] <up_running> well, I agree with it from how I understand their stance
[18:31:35] <__adrian> tbc, i'm not blaming you for this - just pointing out the things that you're telling me your intership wants, that are harmful/counterproductive.
[18:31:53] <up_running> they just want me to finish something so i can have some resume bullets
[18:31:57] <up_running> they are looking out for me
[18:32:16] <__adrian> if your internship wants to to just do the work without understanding it, it's crap. they're only interested in taking advantage of cheap labor.
[18:32:18] <up_running> I was researching for hours at a time all by myself before I was scolded
[18:32:19] <__adrian> no
[18:32:29] <__adrian> they shouldn't be scolding you for that. that's wrong.
[18:32:52] <up_running> it's ok though, i'm enjoying things so far and trying to learn as much as i can.
[18:33:00] <__adrian> they should be teaching, and allowing you to learn also. learning on your own is the single most-important skill for a programmer.
[18:33:03] *** Joins: starz (~starz@2001:41d0:8:4bd3::1)
[18:33:22] <up_running> this sure is a wake up call for how being a professional programmer really is
[18:33:40] <__adrian> no, this is NOT how professionals behave.
[18:33:59] <up_running> what I mean is new tech comes at you fast and you have to adapt quickly somehow
[18:34:17] <up_running> I read about this but it's different when you experience it firsthand
[18:34:27] <__adrian> not "somehow." you have to learn how. you have to learn how to learn, that's exactly what i've been talking about.
[18:34:32] <stenno> my company gave me some space to learn about containerization and docker in the last weeks, and this will directly benefit the company as we are now changing (or establishing, rather) a proper CI/CD pipeline
[18:34:58] <__adrian> "...when you experience it firsthand"  sounds like all you're experiencing is a bad employer.
[18:35:00] <stenno> so the time my company gave me will directly benefit them again, and i learn interesting skills. its a win-win for both
[18:35:22] <stenno> soudns like your employer either doesn't trust you, or they don't have any idea on how a programmer acquires skills
[18:35:41] <stenno> it cannot be in the interest of the employer that you stay on your level of knowledge when they hired you
[18:35:52] <up_running> well, let me get to reading up on databases so I can solve this issue
[18:35:55] <__adrian> having "bullet points" on your resume will not help you, at all, if you didn't actually learn about anything.
[18:36:06] <stenno> and they also cannot demand that you are doing research in your free time
[18:36:11] <up_running> because this task is quite large and this is only one component
[18:36:15] <__adrian> ^
[18:36:55] <__adrian> an intern should not have large, multi-component tasks.
[18:37:22] <__adrian> they should be part of a team, and be paired with a more senior developer, that they can follow along with.
[18:37:46] <__adrian> and as stenno says, they should absolutely not be giving you work in your unpaid time.
[18:38:31] <up_running> this isn't work that they've assigned to me that I'm doing right now here in the channel
[18:38:43] <up_running> I'm doing this of my own volition
[18:39:03] <up_running> since I want to be proactive in being able to utilize the internship hours well
[18:39:58] <__adrian> again, i'm not arguing/accusing. these are things that sound bad, and it's important to be able to recognize that.
[18:40:25] <__adrian> otherwise you'll spend your entire career being abused by bad employers.
[18:40:30] <up_running> yes, the task is the work task I've been assigned to complete, but because it's large and complicated (in my opinion) I'm using my own time to learn more about the tech involved ie PHP & SQL
[18:41:20] <up_running> I do appreciate the discussion as I wish there was a guide somewhere that I could reference regarding how internships should progress and what I should be doing according to my level of experience
[18:41:56] <__adrian> the key indicator is that you should have at least one senior developer falling over themselves to help you learn things
[18:42:37] *** Quits: AnrDaemon (~ZNC@darkdragon-nln.starlink.ru) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[18:42:45] <up_running> How often should I be reaching out for assistance?
[18:42:53] <up_running> and remember, I just a beginner
[18:42:55] <__adrian> every single time you need it
[18:43:05] <__adrian> yes, i'd expect you're a beginner
[18:43:11] <__adrian> that's not a problem
[18:43:30] <up_running> but that's what I mentioned they scolded me about
[18:43:35] <up_running> I wasn't asking enough questions
[18:43:40] <__adrian> that's why i said they sound slike a bad employer.
[18:43:54] <up_running> ohhh, you're saying they should be asking me
[18:44:07] <__adrian> no
[18:44:16] <__adrian> (well yes, but) you should be asking them
[18:44:19] <Blondie101010> well it does go both ways
[18:44:24] <__adrian> and they should not be mad at you about it
[18:44:25] <up_running> so you agree with them then?
[18:44:40] <__adrian> not if they're telling you to not reaserch things, no.
[18:44:52] <__adrian> not if they're telling you to just get the project done.
[18:45:08] <__adrian> not if they're telling you to do the learning on yur own time.
[18:45:09] <up_running> they were just bothered that I was spending far to much time trying to go at it alone instead just reaching out and asking for help
[18:45:16] <__adrian> that's fine
[18:45:23] <__adrian> did you start asking them questions?
[18:45:33] <up_running> oh, of course
[18:45:47] <up_running> I must have asked at least 30 questions that day
[18:45:50] <__adrian> did they start helping you, a LOT, with understanding the things you're asking about?
[18:46:13] <up_running> they gave me guidance
[18:46:23] <__adrian> that kinda sounds like a "no"
[18:46:39] <up_running> which I'm ok with since I feel like they think I can figure it out with a little push
[18:47:03] <up_running> I was just ashamed to ask earlier
[18:47:23] <__adrian> so they said "stop learning on your own, ask questions" and then you asked questions and they said "right, now go do it on your own"
[18:47:25] <Blondie101010> that can be a problem
[18:47:26] <__adrian> ...?
[18:47:54] <__adrian> _most of your day_ should be sitting with someone, working on code together.
[18:48:14] <up_running> no, they just gave me guidance similar to how things are discussed here in programming channels like this one.
[18:48:30] <__adrian> talking about approaches, writing a little bit of code, reviewing it, repeat
[18:48:46] <up_running> ah, well, it's not like that then
[18:48:50] <Blondie101010> __adrian:  for how many decades?  that seems intense :)
[18:49:16] <__adrian> Blondie101010: i'm assuming they haven't been in this internship for decades
[18:49:35] <up_running> about a week so far
[18:49:39] <__adrian> right
[18:49:44] <up_running> but I'm already writing a full database
[18:49:49] <up_running> it's so exciting
[18:50:10] <__adrian> that's great to hear
[18:50:11] <Blondie101010> stressing about the number of questions you ask on a new job is normal
[18:50:39] <Blondie101010> but it should usually be a lot at the beginning and going down progressively
[18:50:57] <__adrian> my point is, as an intern, you shouldn't be in charge of an entire project. you shouldn't be left to do all your work on your own.
[18:51:13] <up_running> Blondie101010: remember when I posted my initial post about a week ago?
[18:51:15] <__adrian> yes, as blondie says, worrying about stuff is normal.
[18:51:23] <up_running> it was very confusing
[18:51:35] <up_running> but I think I've come along a bit after this week

[21:13:24] <JohnDoe1> sup peeps, got a php-fpm image running in docker but the default listen directive is on ipv6 stack only for some odd reason. So I can't get to php-fpm on port 9000 because of that. Are there env values or do I have to figure out how to edit the config via docker-compose?
[21:14:22] <BadAdviceCat> JohnDoe1, you may need to add extra options/parameters in your command to start docker on a different ip address.
[21:14:56] <BadAdviceCat> Or find options that alters ip which you can throw into the relevant config file.
[21:14:57] <JohnDoe1> meaning disable ipv6 in docker?
[21:15:03] <BadAdviceCat> Hi, Rockwood.
[21:15:03] <Rockwood> BadAdviceCat, o/
[21:15:06] <JohnDoe1> well that's basically what I said above :D
[21:15:11] <BadAdviceCat> JohnDoe1, meaning, to set a specific IP.
[21:15:21] <BadAdviceCat> You gotta google for the options.
[21:15:39] <JohnDoe1> well no that's not the issue, the issue is that for some reason php-fpm default to the ipv6 stack only when it listens on its default 9000
[21:17:54] <JohnDoe1> https://paste.debian.net/hidden/4acdfba0/ - that's from the container itself
[21:18:38] <JohnDoe1> :: is ipv6 stack only, you want 0.0.0.0 to be dual-stack but I do not see any environment variables I can set that php-fpm can pick up on which means I'm down to editing the config file somehow
[21:18:50] <Blondie101010> JohnDoe1:  that is not a PHP but a docker question
[21:19:01] <JohnDoe1> it's actually a php question
[21:19:09] <Blondie101010> php-fpm, like any sane service, will listen to what you tell it ot
[21:19:10] <Blondie101010> *to
[21:19:12] <JohnDoe1> php-fpm defaults to be specific, which had a bug filed and was updated for 7.2 only
[21:19:28] <JohnDoe1> its default config seems to be ipv6 only for some reason
[21:19:34] <Blondie101010> if the defaults are not suitable, just change them
[21:19:36] <da_wunder> you could use that docker container name, like `upstream php-upstream { server php:9000; }` where that `php` is the php-fpm service
[21:19:47] <Blondie101010> no your observation is obviously wrong

[21:21:11] <JohnDoe1> da_wunder I think the issue is port forwarding itself expects ipv4 for some reason all I have is ports: - 8080:9000 but if I try to curl 8080 from the host it gets a connection reset
[21:22:09] <da_wunder> why do you even want to expose that php-fpm to your host machine?
[21:22:34] <JohnDoe1> Blondie101010 https://paste.debian.net/hidden/4acdfba0/ that's inside docker, on host it is https://paste.debian.net/hidden/c01fe1d0/ and I ran netstat -tulpn instead
[21:22:55] <JohnDoe1> da_wunder to serve an app which I'll reverse proxy via nginx
[21:23:01] <Blondie101010> you should learn how to use your OS, seriously!
[21:23:25] <JohnDoe1> oh I think we found the problem people, it's my lack of knowledge of the OS
[21:23:31] <da_wunder> JohnDoe1: I'm using php-fpm and nginx with docker-compose setup - and I don't need to expose that php-fpm container port to host machine
[21:23:49] <JohnDoe1> da_wunder nginx is not running in the same network, it's external
[21:23:58] <Blondie101010> JohnDoe1:  from the host, does `telnet $lanIP 9000` connect?
[21:24:11] <Blondie101010> *lanIPv4
[21:24:45] <da_wunder> hmm, you could bridge those networks in your docker-compose.yml
[21:25:18] <JohnDoe1> I could if they were running on the same host
[21:25:41] <JohnDoe1> alright so bottom line, no environment variables for php-fpm, correct?
[21:25:58] <Blondie101010> what environment would you change if you can't reach the machine?
[21:26:05] <Blondie101010> ask your sysadmin
[21:26:12] <Blondie101010> or OS support
[21:26:14] <JohnDoe1> something like PHP_FPM_LISTEN_HOST
[21:26:23] <Blondie101010> set it in the config file
[21:26:28] <JohnDoe1> so the answer is no
[21:26:36] <JohnDoe1> php-fpm only reads a config file.
[21:26:45] <Blondie101010> can't grasp your lack of logic
[21:26:56] <Blondie101010> services don't run in the client shell
[21:26:56] <Rockwood> Blondie101010, o/
[21:26:59] <JohnDoe1> always a breath of fresh air asking questions in php
[21:27:10] <Blondie101010> ask a PHP question and it'll go better!
[21:27:13] <JohnDoe1> your lack of understanding is baffling me yet you answer like you know what you're talking about :)
[21:27:38] <Blondie101010> learn to use docker and basic networking
[21:27:50] <JohnDoe1> anyway thanks for your time
[21:27:58] <Blondie101010> if the machine can't reach the IP where the service is, then fix that
[21:28:21] <Blondie101010> I went beyond what should be supported here and you bullshitted
[21:28:35] <Blondie101010> if the IP is not reachable from another machine, learn networking!
[21:29:02] <Blondie101010> you could bridge or NAT
[21:29:59] <JohnDoe1> you went past what I asked which was plainly if php-fpm can be configured via environmental variables. Gave you context so you don't wonder why would anyone ever ask that. That's normal for people who help others because they think "this guy is obviously not asking the right question". Which may be true at times, but don't make it a rule
[21:30:25] <JohnDoe1> it has nothing to do with networking, ip reachability or my understanding of networking or OS. it's a simple php-fpm related question.
[21:31:33] <da_wunder> I was just explaining how I have used php-fpm + nginx with docker-compose - we didn't eg. know that you run that nginx on different host and etc.
[21:32:33] <JohnDoe1> to be clear I'm not blaming anyone, just voiced my displeasure with how things go generally in php. da_wunder that's normal, and so is Blondie101010's reaction to my question but sometimes you have to check your assumptions
[21:33:07] <da_wunder> JohnDoe1: don't know what BLondie said, so cannot really anything about that
[21:33:23] <Blondie101010> JohnDoe1:  php-fpm has extensive and simple documentation on how to configure it, and starting services based on environment variables is more than outdated...  it only used to be common decades ago when people didn't know better
[21:33:44] <Blondie101010> and that is in-line with my point to learn to use your damn OS and docker
[21:34:26] <da_wunder> s/really/really say
[21:35:38] <Blondie101010> JohnDoe1:  note that I was going beyond the channel topic when I tried to validate your problem with fpm listening only on IPv6 and you started bullshitting instead of realizing it was a false premise
[21:36:01] <JohnDoe1> did you read https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=74166 ?
[21:36:06] <Blondie101010> it will only listen to a specific IP or interface if you force irt
[21:36:49] <Blondie101010> JohnDoe1:  is that the error you're getting? :)
[21:36:52] <Blondie101010> come on
[21:37:25] <da_wunder> yes, but I haven't seen that issue on my setups
[21:38:03] *** Quits: Naktibalda (~Naktibald@88.135.22.17) (Quit: Light travels faster then sound, which is why some people appear bright, until you hear them speak)
[21:38:55] *** Parts: [twisti] (~twisti@toadwater.com) ()
[21:39:30] <JohnDoe1> so the idea is that if you have ipv6 it will listen on [::]:9000 unless otherwise configured. That behavior was supposed to be changed in future versions but was deemed deleterious for other processes depending on it, and the fix was only applied to 7.2
[21:39:44] *** Quits: Rockwood (~Rocky@user/rocky) (Quit: The Time is Over)
[21:39:46] <Blondie101010> yes
[21:39:49] <JohnDoe1> so my issue is just the last part "unless otherwise configured", that's what I need to do.
[21:39:55] <Blondie101010> that does not stop it from working on ipv4
[21:40:01] <JohnDoe1> it does in this case
[21:40:05] <Blondie101010> no
[21:40:11] <JohnDoe1> otherwise inside my container I would also see 0.0.0.0:9000
[21:40:17] <Blondie101010> if the IP is not reachable from the other machine, it can't work as is
[21:40:32] <Blondie101010> remember my telnet test I asked you?
[21:40:43] <Blondie101010> that is how you test for connectivity on a service port
[21:40:57] <JohnDoe1> or a curl from within the container, which should serve some html
[21:41:02] <Blondie101010> if that works, then you move on to the correct part that is not working as intended
[21:41:37] <Blondie101010> JohnDoe1:  if you want me to help you, I don't mind, but I need direct answers/outputs
[21:41:37] <AnrDaemon> curl would work for http, but not CGI.
[21:41:52] <__adrian> "...the fix was only applied to 7.2"  that comment was made in 2017, when 7.2 was the most current version. if you look at the context (in previous comments, they were planning to fix in 7.0+), it's obvious that this does not mean the fix won't be in 7.3+
[21:41:58] <Blondie101010> what is the machine's LAN IP?
[21:42:22] <Blondie101010> it's not even their problem, just a random bug report
[21:42:43] <__adrian> sure. but still, disingenuous
[21:43:01] <__adrian> that whole part of the conversation is just noise
[21:43:11] <JohnDoe1> the last comment I took as the last answer, which is that it won't be applied to future versions after some more reviewing
[21:43:25] <JohnDoe1> After some consideration of the impact of the fix and the ease with which it can be worked around via configuration, I've decided to only apply the fix to 7.2
[21:43:32] <__adrian> ok, let's take a step back, then.
[21:43:36] *** Quits: kicken (~Kicken@23.138.176.127) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[21:43:37] <JohnDoe1> so the bottom line is to change my config :D
[21:43:50] <Blondie101010> could be but so far you're not making it clear
[21:43:52] <AnrDaemon> What is THE PROBLEM?
[21:44:34] <Blondie101010> to me it *sounded* like a problem reaching a local docker instance IP from another computer
[21:44:43] <__adrian> "configure as desired" is a first approach. but what i'm going to say is, if there's a problem, let's look at that. we don't need to argue about irrelevant stuff, here.
[21:44:59] <JohnDoe1> wasn't going to argue, but it's always like that when I ask a question here
[21:45:15] <JohnDoe1> so I decided to voice it. You don't like it, that's fine, I know where the door is :)
[21:45:23] <__adrian> i'm saying this because you already were. so let's stop, and refocus.
[21:45:29] <__adrian> no one is kicking you out.
[21:47:32] <AnrDaemon> JohnDoe1: if there's no problem you are trying to fix, we're not against a small talk, but we have to understand the background.
[21:49:54] <JohnDoe1> I understand, it is clear from Blondie101010's answer that I cannot change the listen directive via an env variable which is one way docker does things, but there's also volume mounting which I can do and bypass the config file inside the container. So at this point the rest of the problem I'm facing is really not php :D Thank you again.

[21:50:54] <Blondie101010> so you missed my point
[21:51:42] <JohnDoe1> well yes, like a entry point bash script that takes the env var and applies it to the config or something :) there's definitely options, was just looking for the quickest way out
[21:52:03] <Blondie101010> I don't see why you'd complicate things like that
[21:53:36] <Blondie101010> it's a matter of network design

[22:31:11] <NakedKing> What is the best practise for this?  $str = 'abcdef'; $needFirst5Letter = $str[0].$str[1].$str[2].$str[3].$str[4];
[22:31:34] <__adrian> ...probably not that
[22:31:37] <__adrian> what do you want?
[22:32:26] <__adrian> you just want the first five bytes of a string?
[22:32:37] <NakedKing> yes dear __adrian
[22:32:51] <__adrian> https://php.net/substr
[22:33:00] <__adrian> though note, i said "bytes"  ;)
[22:33:25] <NakedKing> muchas gracias. i figure it ^^
[22:34:15] <da_wunder> or just something like - https://3v4l.org/e6Mt5
[22:36:09] <AllenJB> See mb_substr() is you want characters and expect multibyte text. Altho I don't know how that handles compound characters

[23:33:29] <Blondie101010> AllenJB:  mb_substr() does its job :)
[23:34:53] <Blondie101010> but the man pages could be made a bit clearer as they both refer to "character"
