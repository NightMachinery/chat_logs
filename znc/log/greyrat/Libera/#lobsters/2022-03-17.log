[14:04:09] <iDrougge> Why doesn't Python's standard library follow PEP8?
[14:14:06] <leonardo> i suppose pep8 is used in the python library, just not everywhere
[14:15:08] <iDrougge> I'm sure it is used _somewhere_ in the library.
[14:15:09] <leonardo> probably in light of the fact that not everywhere it improves readability
[14:15:40] <iDrougge> It would never degrade readability, would it?
[14:16:09] <iDrougge> And readability is not all; it also minimises the number of things you need to remember since there are fewer surprises.
