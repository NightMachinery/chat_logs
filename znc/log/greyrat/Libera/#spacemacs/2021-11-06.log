[18:36:44] <FromGitter> <dillydog_gitlab> After trying these updates, and the new PR, using `org-version` still displays version 9.4.6. This is the case on both my Linux (openSUSE) and Win10 machines. I'll post this to the PR message.
[18:37:06] <FromGitter> <dillydog_gitlab> Thanks again for for all of your effort on this issue, it's much appreciated.
[19:04:55] <FromGitter> <llllbarcodellllllllll> When I set a cursor on the function in python-mode in the right top corner appear a little black window with help about function what variable in the emacs could switch off this behaviour?
[19:06:21] <FromGitter> <llllbarcodellllllllll>  (https://files.gitter.im/543c742ddb8155e6700cb292/rUxW/Screenshot-2021-11-07-at-02.36.11.png)
[19:08:33] <FromGitter> <llllbarcodellllllllll> it's appear automatically after install the python layer and annoying.
[20:06:21] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I just installed the org layer on a fresh (test) Spacemacs install, and it installed version 9.5. Also, on my working installation, it started installing org 9.5 right after doing `SPC f e R`. I don't know what is the crucial step...
[20:16:44] <FromGitter> <dillydog_gitlab> I think a totally fresh emacs + spacemacs install is a great idea. I'll give it a try now.
[20:17:34] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Maybe you can just remove the current org directory from your .emacs.d/elpa directory
[20:18:14] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> And press `SPC f e R/q r`
[20:31:46] <FromGitter> <dillydog_gitlab> Oops, I already reinstalled emacs and spacemacs. It worked perfectly. Thank you so much for the help. This is a great update for spacemacs.
[20:32:28] <FromGitter> <dillydog_gitlab> I will update my comment on the github PR.
[20:33:28] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Haha okay! Great!
[20:52:19] <FromGitter> <dillydog_gitlab> I deleted the org-2021XXXX directory, then ran `git pull --rebase` on my Win10 install and it worked perfectly. This rules. Do you accept bounties via PayPal?
[20:53:47] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Well, sure... that's great!
[20:53:59] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> I have some links here https://github.com/dalanicolai/sketch-mode
[20:56:16] <FromGitter> <dillydog_gitlab> Beautiful. Thanks again, excellent work.
[20:56:45] <FromGitter> <dalanicolai> Thank you for reporting and the feedback... and the coffee I guess :)
