[00:00:10] <Betawolf> 'atheist but I like ghost stories'
[00:00:23] <gwern> 'atheist but not, like, a jerk'
[00:00:41] <Betawolf> 'willing to lie to children and people who are dying'
[00:00:55] <gwern> 'atheist and enjoys eating easter bunnies'
[00:01:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> Personally I think we just need to popularize the idea of "Christian atheist"
[00:01:49] <Betawolf> atheist but goes to church?
[00:01:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> The only thing that makes that difficult in the first place is America's weird thing where we have all these obscure Christian sects
[00:01:54] <gwern> 'tikokeist'
[00:02:07] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: Sure, maybe goes to church, maybe doesn't, not really the point
[00:02:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: It's by analogy to "Jewish atheist", "Hindu atheist", even "Catholic atheist" is a ething, etc.
[00:03:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, am I Jewish? Yes. Other than ethnicity am I still Jewish? Yes. Do I believe in God? No. Therefore...
[00:03:47] <Betawolf> Does Judaism even care if you 'believe in' God?
[00:03:52] <Obormot\Arcturus> Well, sure
[00:04:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> I mean unless you're very Reform I guess
[00:04:04] <gwern> 'jewtheist'. 'I don't believe jews exist. have you ever looked at all the things they are claimed to have done and how many famous people are claimed to be jews?'
[00:05:23] <Betawolf> well, from that survey, at least 93% of things people believe are Jews aren't real
[00:05:55] <Obormot\Arcturus> Jews are real and New York City is entirely composed of Jews
[00:06:00] <Obormot\Arcturus> All 100 million of us
[00:06:11] <gwern> guy who doesn't believe in jews, only in an international conspiracy of elites controlling the world and admitting new members into their injokey Bilderberg/Masonic rituals and madeup religion
[00:07:03] <Betawolf> ("you know what's better than Israel? 10 Israels!")
[00:08:01] <gwern> ("but wait, then is all the stuff about jews being circumcised fake?" "no, it's real." "but -" "and people complain about fraternities...")
[00:09:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: You have to admit, Jews are pretty unrealistic. Imagine writing a fantasy novel with such a race: "You're saying these people are totally persecuted all the time BUT they're still smart and successful and rich? Yeah ok... and in this part here you have them winning a war against like a half-dozen other nations at once?? Come on man this is middle school level stuff"
[00:09:59] <Betawolf> The Bible is a bit of a Mary Jew story
[00:10:02] <gwern> and then the whole victimization stuff, clearly written by a woman
[00:10:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> Indeed, indeed
[00:10:15] <Obormot\Arcturus> Betawolf: I lol'd
[00:10:23] <gwern> oh how noble and awful their suffering is, no one has been persecuted like them by someone who is literally as evil as hitler

At Lowell, which has a ninety-nine-per-cent graduation rate and mean SAT scores over thirteen hundred, his own talents for teaching could flourish. “I’m sure that there were students in my classes in L.A. who could have gotten the material as quickly, but there was so much else happening

[01:48:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> ... what
[01:50:04] <saturn2> just another day in the javascript ~ecosystem~
[01:50:22] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: what's so hard to understand? I'm surprised you haven't erased your own files, as a russian, to protest putin and punish yourself for such genocidal aggression
[01:50:34] <gwern> are you sure you are a good person?
[01:50:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> :(
[01:54:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> So yeah, and people wonder why I don't use JS frameworks and shit
[01:55:40] <PlanckWalk> I'd say npm is a risky single point of failure, but it's really a link to thousands of points of failure.
[01:56:22] <ggreer> eh. anyone who does this ruins their career. if their stunt pisses off the wrong person or company it could even land them in legal trouble
[01:56:25] <saturn2> it's a big open pit that everyone can throw random garbage into
[01:57:16] <PlanckWalk> The fact that this one of thousands is deliberate says little about all the random problems that mostly pass silently.
[01:57:28] <ggreer> to cause harm you need to control a big npm module, and that means years of building trust
[01:57:40] <saturn2> there's no assurance that everyone writing software on npm has a career to ruin
[01:58:08] <PlanckWalk> Where by "silently" I mean in the media attention sense, not the screaming when your project fails randomly sense.
[01:58:08] <ggreer> also everyone freezes package versions using yarn or package-lock.json
[01:58:13] <synthmeat> did corejs guy got out of the jail? :D
[01:59:26] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: This is upstream of Vue, which I would say is "big"

[01:59:40] <Robomot> update `eslint-plugin-es-x` · zloirock/core-js@ac1ffa5 · GitHub
[01:59:56] <synthmeat> yeah, seems like he got out sometime in 2020
[02:00:03] <saturn2> version freezes are trivially circumvented by an attack that doesn't trigger before a certain time
[02:00:28] <ggreer> then you risk people noticing the code before it's active
[02:00:34] <Obormot\Arcturus> His github name is "zloirock"? Nice, nice
[02:01:03] <Obormot\Arcturus> (It means something like "dark fate" or "grim fate")

[02:02:05] <saturn2> there's a negligible risk that anyone will audit code on npm
[02:02:39] <ggreer> uhh... what? big companies audit their dependencies
[02:03:25] <ggreer> of course they don't update their deps until after auditing them, by which time the bugs or malicious contributions are almost always hit by people on the bleeding edge
[02:04:21] <gwern> ggreer: how could any activist with moral clarity *delay* their code? the world needs their message now! how absurd it would be to put in a delay so that in 5 years it replaces every with "DEFUND ICE NOW"

[02:04:36] <saturn2> if by auditing you mean giving it a quick read
[02:04:58] <ggreer> no I mean actual auditing. it's very expensive and time consuming, and it's frustrating for devs because we want to use the latest and greatest stuff
[02:06:02] <saturn2> that makes no sense, it would bee faster to just rewrite it yourself
[02:07:04] <Obormot\Arcturus> saturn2: Didn't you read that Dan Luu post? Most shops don't think of writing things themselves
[02:07:30] <saturn2> hmm
[02:08:28] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Also, what's the point of writing something yourselves? Bad for the devs' resumes! "What did you use in your last job?" "I used Vue / React / whatever!" "Cool, cool, and you over there?" "Well I used uh our in-house custom thing you've never heard of because we wrote it ourselves because we didn't want to audit..." "Get the hell out of my office")
[02:08:52] <gwern> (very illegible, yeah)
[02:11:08] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And consequently: "Hey so what do you guys use here?" "Vue / React / whatever" "Ooh very exiciting" "And how about you guys, what do you use?" "We use our custom in-house thing that we..." <rockstar dev has already stopped listening and is in fact already working for your competitors and they have beaten you to all markets and you're bankrupt>)
[02:11:23] <ggreer> rewriting is usually stupid. are you going to write docs as good as the popular frameworks & libraries? will you add a ton of questions & answers on stack overflow? etc
[02:11:42] <ggreer> you can contract out the audits then send patches upstream
[02:12:10] <Obormot\Arcturus> (But of course the docs are often bad and the SO answers are often bad and outdated and not even needed if you're doing in-house because you have all the knowledge and expertise already there...)
[02:12:30] <Obormot\Arcturus> But now we see the precise attitude Luu was mocking
[02:12:32] <ggreer> the people writing the library aren't the ones using it
[02:12:45] *** Joins: bildramer (~bildramer@2a02:587:6206:5600:ac58:4750:57ef:fd00)
[02:15:05] <saturn2> a contractor is even less likely to bother trying to rule out potential obfuscated code paths
[02:15:29] <ggreer> depends on the contractor. you pay more for good work
[02:15:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: btw you have a bit of smallcaps weirdness on /Clippy - "A descendant of AutoML-Zero", and the smallcaps is... "ML-Z"?? Which ends up looking weird. Another regexp false positive...?
[02:16:14] <saturn2> any given contractor has a 99.999% chance of never encountering any obfuscated malware
[02:16:42] <saturn2> no one will ever know whether they are good at finding it or not
[02:17:20] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, "contract out the audits" sounds like a way to guarantee that this stuff doesn't get caught
[02:17:39] <ggreer> you don't hire any given contractor. you hire https://twitter.com/NCCsecurityUS and friends
[02:17:40] <Robomot> NCC Group North America InfoSec (@NCCsecurityUS) (http://twitter.censors.us/pic/pbs.twimg.com%2Fprofile_images%2F1413605842050486274%2FXyQycSPe_400x400.jpg)
[02:17:46] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: idea there is to stretch across hyphens for things like 'GPT-2-117M'. I guess the rule here is that it should only be an uppercase expression so 'AutoML-Zero' gets no smallcaps at all?
[02:19:23] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: I think that's best yeah
[02:19:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: Is there any shop that makes anything widely used and *doesn't* hire those guys
[02:20:09] <ggreer> the biggest companies have their own internal teams that do the same job
[02:21:25] * gwern stares at "[A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9]+-[A-Z0-9]+|". hm. how to exclude lowercase wrappers...
[02:21:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> ggreer: If all of this is true then how did this get into Vue, lol
[02:21:44] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: lookahead/lookbehind :)
[02:21:56] <gwern> not supported by this regexp lib afaik
[02:22:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> whaaat
[02:22:13] <gwern> but let's check the docs...
[02:22:28] <saturn2> most of these tweets seem to relate to accidentally written obfuscated malware that slipped into production software at major companies aka security vulnerabilities
[02:24:51] <gwern> oh, it's POSIX regex. which apparently don't support lookahead/behind and I guess that's why we have PCRE
[02:27:23] <gwern> I guess I can capture punctuation/whitespace/end-of-string then
[02:28:13] <ggreer> Obormot\Arcturus: it got into an old version of vue-cli because the author fucked up the patch to pin the version: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/commit/37ef809c873f33c88ba7928fca785e87bfaf2491
[02:28:14] <Robomot> fix: lock node-ipc version · vuejs/vue-cli@37ef809 · GitHub
[02:28:51] <Obormot\Arcturus> Hmmmm
[02:28:54] <ggreer> had they done nothing there never would have been a malicious version of vue v2's cli
[02:29:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> And yet they didn't do nothing
[02:29:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> And Vue is a major framework used by many
[02:29:29] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Shameful imo. Get a better regexp library
[02:30:05] <gwern> wouldn't be a terrible idea but risk/reward ratio isn't great
[02:30:33] <ggreer> Obormot\Arcturus: it was caught and fixed within 6 minutes
[02:31:56] <ggreer> again this is vue-cli which is only used by vue v2. vue v2 doesn't get bug fixes. it only gets security updates (and only for the next 18 months)
[02:33:19] <pie__> how did they catch it in 6 minutes
[02:33:38] <ggreer> because another maintainer or contributor noticed
[02:33:44] <ggreer> you can see the comment on the commit I linked to
[02:34:00] <pie__> ah
[02:34:23] <saturn2> there was no attempt to hide the attack
[02:35:29] <ggreer> https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vue/cli?activeTab=versions the vulnerable version is 5.0.2 which has been downloaded 170 times. that includes people who downloaded the vulnerable version just to see what was up with it

[02:35:38] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Pull, sync to push the popups.js update live, then test current reader-mode.js prototype
[02:36:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: (When you do so, after pasting into console, be sure to click into the page, or close the console, else the alt-key toggle won't work [as the console will be focused, of course])
[02:36:23] <gwern> ack
[02:37:33] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: (Still a bunch of stuff to do, gotta do a bit of refactoring of links.css, various styling tweaks, a bug or three, plus of course there's no UI for toggling reader mode manually yet - that is yet to come)
[02:37:56] <Obormot\Arcturus> But it's far enough along to start testing in parallel
[02:38:11] <gwern> but exciting anyway, we've never really quite designed a feature so specifically to change the reading experience of a page
[02:38:49] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yes
[02:39:12] <saturn2> i mean, there was some attempt to hide the attack, but one that actually only made it look way more suspicious (decoding and eval'ing base64 strings)
[02:42:22] <ggreer> at some point you have to import fs and call writeFile or similar functions (or import child_process and fork or shell out)
[02:43:54] <gwern> you say that; I say I want to see the results of the International Obfuscated JS Competition first
[02:44:28] <pie__> i mean at least use... *searches*

[02:47:41] <Filipepe> hello all
[02:48:21] <saturn2> a real obfuscator would find a legitimate reason to call writeFile and then use the many confusing JS features to create a divergence between what a human reading the code will think is happening and what the computer is actually doing
[02:48:32] <ggreer> you can obfuscate the code, but it'll look obviously obfuscated
[02:48:50] <ggreer> it's much easier to only put the malicious code in a minified npm package. it's not like there's some law of physics that npm packages must mirror their git repos
[02:50:39] <ggreer> though you couldn't just update an existing version since that'd fail the yarn/npm checksums
[02:50:55] <saturn2> this is so easy it can happen by accident e.g. that steam update that would delete all your files
[02:54:10] <kuudes> hi Filipepe
[02:58:21] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: is the long delay on hover intentional to reduce accidental link swaps?
[03:01:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Yeah, and so scrubbing mouse over a page doesn't make things strobe in and out ... it's adjustable
[03:02:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> showMaskedLinksDelay
[03:02:27] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: yes, I was just thinking that perhaps it could fade in, as right now it feels like I am left guessing if anything is working
[03:02:38] <gwern> it's noticeably longer than you expect from popups or other interactions
[03:02:54] <Obormot\Arcturus> Ok now that's not true
[03:03:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Popup trigger delay is 600ms, this is 250ms

[07:29:47] <saturn2> most problematically, improvements in an average of some narrow or proxy indicator across a large population is illogically used to conclude that everything is getting better in all particular ways for all people
[07:35:27] <PapuaHardyNet> do you have any resources you recommend I read that have better analyses of this phenomenon?
[07:48:43] <Obormot\Arcturus> Yeah, this post is bad
[07:50:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> The bottom-line problem with it is: getting so into details, insight-porn-y systemic explanations that you forget what the basic questions you're asking are, or why you care about them
[07:50:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> Like, here's the summary of the post's thesis, at the end:
[07:50:47] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Bottom line. When I look separately at the various pieces of the CCCH, I ultimately don't see a good case that our society is getting less competent across the board, or "forgetting how to do basic things," or anything like that. I think our society is getting bigger, wealthier, and more capable, and it's sometimes "getting in its own way" in ways that we might naturally expect. "
[07:51:09] <Obormot\Arcturus> And here's the initial problem statement / purported claim:
[07:51:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Collapsing civilizational competence hypothesis (CCCH): we have so much wealth and technology, we have such a huge population, and yet - we collectively can't match the music or literature of the past, or its scientific innovation, or its ability to provide an affordable education and health care, or even its subway station construction. Something is badly broken in our culture."
[07:51:40] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is that "bottom line" an answer to the question? Is it even relevant to the question?
[07:52:01] <Obormot\Arcturus> Is it true that we collectively can't match the etc. etc. of the past? Yes
[07:52:16] <Obormot\Arcturus> Has anything this post has said refuted any of that, all? No
[07:52:22] <Obormot\Arcturus> Has it even attempted to refute it? No
[07:55:28] <PlanckWalk> It didn't even address half of it, and basically agreed with the other half while purporting to refute some of it.
[07:56:55] <PlanckWalk> "Yes, it's true in every detail that I bother to examine, but ..."
[07:58:02] <Obormot\Arcturus> And there's a general pattern that this post follows, that I see from a lot of "rationalist" types
[07:58:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> It goes like this:
[07:59:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> "Problem X exists, and is bad" "Ah! No no, there's an explanation for that, actually: it's because of complicated dynamic Y" "... ok? And?" "Well, I've explained X" "But it's ... still a problem and is bad? Do you agree?" "*shrug*"
[08:00:42] <PlanckWalk> I can explain that!
[08:01:32] <Obormot\Arcturus> So here he's like "aha, [this face of] what *some people call* 'civilization decline' is *actually* because of this complicated thing called 'Baumol's cost disease!' So there you go, problem explained and addressed, no civilization decline after all"
[08:01:50] <Obormot\Arcturus> And several similar things
[08:01:58] <PlanckWalk> Yep, that sums it up pretty well. Just surrounded by some more waffling.
[08:06:50] <PapuaHardyNet> huh. that's a pretty good breakdown of why the post is bad.

[08:31:07] <PlanckWalk> I don't think it's even fake explanations
[08:32:03] <PlanckWalk> The problem is that it's purporting to refute a phenomenon, and instead provides an explanation for it.
[08:32:43] <PlanckWalk> Or at least, in this case, part of an explanation for part of it.
[08:32:50] <PlanckWalk> Then just claims victory in the conclusion.
[08:35:10] <PapuaHardyNet> I'm unable to describe this sort of mental gymnastics that leads to someone deciding to just... stop thinking after hitting a possible explanation for a phenomenon.

[08:41:17] <PlanckWalk> Yep, it's a sort of meme based on "I kuldnt even spel enjinear, now I ar one"
[08:44:19] <PapuaHardyNet> I can't figure out a possible mechanism that leads to rationalists using explanations for parts of a problem as stopsigns. Perhaps they are only rewarded socially for being able to explain problems, and not for actually solving them, so they are only incentivized to explain things and not actually solve problems.

[16:51:42] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: what, the general bracket bug? all of it? how does the fix work?
[16:54:11] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Injecting additional elements >_>
[16:55:31] <Obormot\Arcturus> (Specifically, an empty span at the beginning of affected links. Because it's empty, it obviously cannot suffer from the "multiple fragments, possibly split over multiple lines, the union of whose rects creates a positioning context of inappropriate dimensions" problem)

[16:55:58] *** Joins: gproto23 (~gproto23@user/gproto23)
[16:56:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> (And because the span is at the beginning of the link, and is inlined, its position will exactly correspond to the leftmost edge of the first component text fragment of the link - which is of course exactly where we want to put the bracket)
[16:58:25] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: So yeah I just added a rewrite function that injects these spans ("pop-frame indicator hooks"), refactored the CSS to put the brackets on those, and bam
[16:58:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Incidentally this *also* fixed another minor layout bug! Observe: 
[16:59:18] <gwern> hm. but then why doesn't setting the ::before/::after on it to the line just trigger the shift bug again "oh i'll just split it across two lines"

[17:00:59] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: See that spurious indent on the link fragments at the left margin? Gone!
[17:01:45] <Obormot\Arcturus> (It is because Firefox applies padding of inline elements on a per-fragment basis instead of a per-element basis)
[17:03:01] <gwern> oh. not sure I'd even noticed that

[17:04:17] <gwern> (I usually use FF but not necessarily while looking carefully)
[17:04:37] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: As for the shift bug, by this do you mean the whole "put the bracket on a different line than the link"?
[17:04:41] <gwern> yeah
[17:04:46] <Obormot\Arcturus> That's still there, sadly
[17:05:11] <gwern> damn
[17:05:17] <Obormot\Arcturus> The bracket itself isn't split, there aren't wild line fragments all over the place in the middle of the text

[17:59:29] <zebrask> I was under the impression that EAGx has tons of free space at least this year.
[17:59:56] <zebrask> So maybe it's a rubber stamp.
[18:00:37] <gwern> probably is
[18:00:39] <PapuaHardyNet> I recommend just applying, it'll cost you 20 minutes, and if the conference is held in your country, you don't have much to worry about logistics-wise
[18:00:44] <zebrask> EAGx Boston that is. I guess I'll apply.

[18:25:54] <quanticle> And I've isolated it to markdow-mode with emacs -Q
[18:26:09] <quanticle> But I want to know if it's just my emacs or if yours lags too
[18:27:20] <PapuaHardyNet> mine lags too when I page down multiple times
[18:27:28] <PapuaHardyNet> (for that specific file I mean, obviously)
[18:27:55] <quanticle> Try going to the end and typing something
[18:28:20] <PapuaHardyNet> the screen has gone white
[18:28:59] <PapuaHardyNet> yeah lol this lags badly. I have to wait for a few seconds and then the screen stops blanking and shows the results of my keypresses.
[18:29:00] <quanticle> Okay, well, my emacs doesn't misbehave *quite* that badly, but there is a very noticeable and painful delay between my typing and any output appearing on the screen
[18:29:24] <PapuaHardyNet> Well, I'm not using `emacs -Q` but my default doom emacs config
[18:29:28] <quanticle> Which version of emacs are you running, if I might ask?
[18:29:43] <PapuaHardyNet> 27.2
[18:29:59] <quanticle> Oh, that's probably even worse for you, because it's probably loading additional minor modes which are adding to the strain.
[18:30:00] <gwern> quanticle: mm. definitely a bit laggy. each PgDwn is definitely like 2 or 3s. gets faster once I've viewed the entire buffer. deleting lines is not instant but I wouldn't describe as terrible for markdown-mode
[18:30:12] <quanticle> Have you tried adding text?
[18:30:26] <quanticle> That's the real pain for me. Adding text is just horrendously bad.
[18:35:05] <gwern> yes, it's laggy, but nothing worse than I expect from markdown-mode at this point for extremely large lists
[18:35:41] <gwern> (I'd be making individual days sections anyway)
[18:36:07] <quanticle> I find it vaguely concerning that you look at emacs' behavior in this case and react that way. "Oh yeah, it pegs one core of my CPU at 100% and has like a 1000ms delay between typing and text appearing on the screen, this is fine"
[18:36:31] <quanticle> For the record, the worse-is-better emacs (i.e. VSCode) handles this just fine
[18:36:49] <gwern> I don't have a ton of tooling or experience built up in vscode
[18:37:19] <gwern> markdown-mode is not efficient. oh well. hopefully someone will build a lsp-mode which doesn't rely on a giant fragile pile of slow regexps. that someone will not be me
[18:37:42] <synthmeat> treesitter+lsp is really fast
[18:37:47] <gwern> I have a whole thundering herd of yaks elsewhere who currently resemble physicists' spheres
[18:38:52] <synthmeat> slowly accreting lua in neovim feels so much better than vimscript in vim. i can only imagine how nice it is with elisp
[18:39:08] <gwern> so, that is my bottomline for you. it would be better if it was sectionized, and otherwise, this is not exceptional for markdown-mode that I can see and the maintainer is likely fully aware that this file would be slow
[18:40:31] <quanticle> Yeah, yeah, fine, I'll sectionize it
[18:41:15] <quanticle> The problem is that, when I'm writing outlines of books, I can't sectionize that as easily as I could sectionize this
[18:41:26] <gwern> (once you've gone 6 or 7 deep, it's time to start rethinking it)
[18:41:41] <quanticle> Eh, the list isn't that deep. It's just long.
[18:41:43] <gwern> hm? this has super obvious sectionizing. by day.
[18:42:13] <gwern> no, it is. look at stuff like '- Good tactics at the squad level'. that's... 6 deep?
[18:42:32] <quanticle> Yes. This has obvious sectionizing. But not all outlines have such. Like, if you have a book, and you want your sections to correspond to chapters and sections within chapters, you might be stuck with long lists.
[18:43:17] <quanticle> Oh, I have 4-space indents
[18:43:21] <quanticle> That's only 3 deep
[18:44:19] <gwern> what? no
[18:44:45] <quanticle> Oh, that. Yeah, that's pretty deep
[18:44:49] <gwern> that's a child of: 'Ukrainian forces have done a great job leveraging the urban environment',  'Initial conclusions' 'Urban warfare has featured heavily in this conflict' ... uh I get lost past that
[18:45:00] <gwern> but it's still like 3 deep at that point
[18:45:05] <Obormot\Arcturus> gwern: Well while I'm waiting for Cloudflare cache to clear or ... whatever is causing this stale asset issue... I just found like 1.5 bugs with extracts :|
[18:45:21] <quanticle> Yeah, I stuck an entire other outline as like a child document. Maybe wasn't the smartest idea
[18:45:36] <gwern> the comprehensibility is in question, yes
[18:46:26] <gwern> Obormot\Arcturus: maybe it's the versioning again. I dumped the whole cache
[18:47:21] <Obormot\Arcturus> Can't be the versioning. I'm reloading with devtools open, cache disabled, the works
[18:48:32] <gwern> I mean on CF's side, I don't entirely understand how they do versioning caching. I suspect that when I expire 'foo.cs', a request to 'foo.css?version=12' is still pulling the old one. I thought I disabled queries but stuff like this keeps happening

[23:02:41] <Obormot\Arcturus> Justice prevails! ... eventually

If the consecration happens but peace does not prevail, millions of Catholics could lose hope in the prophecies of Fatima — which could in turn see them question their faith. If peace does prevail, it will prove the prophecies right, but it might also inadvertently empower the
