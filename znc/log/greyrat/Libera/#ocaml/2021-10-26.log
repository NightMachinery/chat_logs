[01:16:44] <Guest93> Is there any way to print the name of a variable in ocaml?
[01:18:19] <d_bot> <NULL> Do you have an example of another language doing that, to get what you mean ?
[01:18:20] <d_bot> <NULL> Because I don't see any language where you could
[01:19:29] <Guest93> I can in common lisp as well as haskell
[01:20:56] <Guest93> one sec on the example
[01:21:54] <d_bot> <NULL> I don't know these languages well enough, but I think I could read Haskell easier. The thing is I don't see how this name isn't compiled away
[01:23:30] <saltrocklamp[m]> i assume haskell provides some runtime reflection ability
[01:23:59] <Guest93> Compile time reflection in ocaml would work just fine in my particular case
[01:24:16] <Guest93> fsharp has nameof: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/nameof
[01:24:33] <Guest93> I can't remember how I inspected symbol names in common lisp
[01:25:24] <saltrocklamp[m]> in lisp you can easily write a macro that accepts a symbol and prints the symbol name
[01:25:56] <saltrocklamp[m]> but i'm not sure that really counts
[01:26:27] <Guest93> that is true - but I also remember something like symbol->name... maybe this was a chicken scheme extension
[01:26:36] <Guest93> but anyways
[01:27:32] <saltrocklamp[m]> what would be the use case for such a thing
[01:27:45] <d_bot> <NULL> There's nothing like that in the Stdlib as far as I'm aware. You should look into `ppx`es for this I would say

[17:28:03] <d_bot> <VPhantom> Hi! I'm not sure which channel this would be best in, so I'm here. I used to use switch `4.11.1+musl+flambda` and I'm trying to upgrade to the latest, 4.13.1, and I notice that those options are no longer available since 4.12.0. The closest I got to installing the equivalent is similar to the release notes for opam 2.1, although not exactly. Below is without flambda to reduce variables.
[17:28:03] <d_bot> <VPhantom>
[17:28:04] <d_bot> <VPhantom> OCaml release notes:
[17:28:06] <d_bot> <VPhantom> ```text
[17:28:07] <d_bot> <VPhantom> opam switch create 4.13.1+flambda -ocaml-variants.4.13.1+options ocaml-option-flambda
[17:28:08] <d_bot> <VPhantom> ```
[17:28:09] <d_bot> <VPhantom> This makes opam crash with `opam: unkonwn option '-o'`. What almost works is removing the `-`:
[17:28:11] <d_bot> <VPhantom> ```text
[17:28:12] <d_bot> <VPhantom> opam switch create 4.13.1+musl ocaml-variants.4.13.1+options ocaml-option-musl
[17:28:13] <d_bot> <VPhantom> ```
[17:28:15] <d_bot> <VPhantom> This fails however, despite my having installed `musl`, `musl-dev` and `musl-tools` as was necessary for using `4.11.1+musl`:
[17:28:16] <d_bot> <VPhantom> ```text

[17:28:25] <d_bot> <VPhantom> In the <4.12 releases musl "just worked" so I'm not sure how to resolve this. Has anyone used `ocaml-option-musl` since 4.12 successfully? Also, should I open a bug report about the extra `-` in the release notes?
[17:43:59] <reynir> @VPhantom this channel is probably fine, but please note that it's bridged to IRC, and code blocks tend to be rather noisy on the irc end. We see the source markdown with each line as a separate message.
[17:45:18] <d_bot> <VPhantom> Ouch, sorry about that!

[22:44:16] <d_bot> <monk> what is the general approach to pretty printing? is it all ppx?
[22:44:31] <d_bot> <monk> one of those things i wish ocaml was a bit less difficult about up front
[22:45:06] <companion_cube> personally it's manual printers, although recently I've been using ppx_deriving.show more and more
[22:46:08] <d_bot> <monk> ppx_deriving is tempting because that's basically what rust gives you for free, haha
[22:46:26] <d_bot> <monk> "free"
[22:47:55] <companion_cube> yeahâ€¦
[22:48:02] <companion_cube> I wish it shipped with the compiler
[22:48:48] <d_bot> <monk> if it were possible to provide a simpler API to `Format` for naive pretty printers, that would work to
[22:49:01] <d_bot> <monk> i can understand why pretty printing is complicated

[22:49:34] <d_bot> <monk> but if it were possible to find a reduced surface for just basic things and make that its own function/sub-module, that would be an improvement imo
[22:50:10] <d_bot> <monk> was overwhelming seeing all the `@` formatting codes and the various sub-arguments you can provide to each, the notion of cutting, open/closing a box, etc

[22:50:50] <d_bot> <monk> then again, maybe that's why `ppx_deriving.show` became a thing to start with...
[22:50:52] <companion_cube> you cn use the `fmt` library
[22:51:04] <companion_cube> or CCFormat :p
[22:51:09] <d_bot> <monk> haha
[22:51:12] <companion_cube> but yeah, it's good to know about boxes

[23:06:59] <d_bot> <mimoo> is there a nicer looking alternative to odoc for html docs?
[23:07:55] *** dinosaure1 is now known as dinosaure

[23:09:35] <d_bot> <monk> cs3110 text touches on pretty printing a bit in Â§5.4.3 but it closes on a weak note by stating:
[23:09:36] <d_bot> <monk> > For more information, see the toplevel manual (search for #install_printer), the Format module, and this OCaml Github issue. The latter seems to be the only place that documents the use of extra arguments, as in pp_val above, to print values of polymorphic types.
