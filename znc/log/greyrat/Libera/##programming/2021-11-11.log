[00:01:33] <apotheon> Yes, it's a job where *that* kind of shit happens.
[00:01:37] <arahael> oldlaptop: i think package systems really should be using it.
[00:02:20] <arahael> apotheon: hey, at least it's known!  a lot of places have *temporary* stopgap measuremenrs that nobody is realising will actually be permanent!
[00:02:33] <oldlaptop> arahael: That would make sense for a *new* one, but most of the important ones either predate sqlite or at least predate the days when you really should just use sqlite
[00:02:55] <oldlaptop> (apt predates sqlite, for example, IIRC - dpkg definitely does)
[00:03:51] <apotheon> oldlaptop: systemd/GNU/Linux
[00:03:52] <arahael> oldlaptop: plenty don't predate salite though, but they seem to prefer to run code to determine the packages.  eg, nix, macports, homebrew...

[00:08:37] <CalimeroTeknik> the "correction" engine thinks you're talking about a weird kind of sqtellite

[02:39:49] <[itchyjunk]> even has a wikipage
[02:40:09] <flakland> game control creates and encapsulates state and view from what i gather
[02:40:15] <flakland> how is there a separation?
[02:40:44] <[itchyjunk]> gamecontrol offloads implementation detail of how the states are changed to gamestate
[02:41:06] <[itchyjunk]> it says "change this state" to gamestate then it says "draw this" to game view
[02:41:33] <[itchyjunk]> as far as i understand, at least
[02:41:35] <flakland> oh its for modulating implementation details?
[02:42:08] <flakland> at compile time
[02:42:36] <flakland> so you can have a game view and state that are black boxes?
[02:43:04] <[itchyjunk]> i think so
[02:43:12] <[itchyjunk]> why are you asking me? i should be asking you?

[02:45:20] <[itchyjunk]> never heard of her
[02:45:30] <flakland> its benefits only seem to enter the stage when you decide you want to swap in a new view, or controller(?), why controller creates state is still a bit confusing
[02:45:44] <flakland> shouldn't the state be a constant entity
[02:46:26] <[itchyjunk]> how do you mean constant?

[02:46:35] <[itchyjunk]> state is similar to state of state machine i think
[02:46:37] <flakland> oh right they do crazy stuff like would have a "base state" that would be worked on, and maybe compose new kinds of entities
[02:46:43] <[itchyjunk]> each time an event happens, like mouse clicks
[02:46:47] <[itchyjunk]> state needs to update

[02:47:29] <sonny> how did you get to insanity?
[02:47:49] <flakland> because you need to be aware of the full heirarchy to make sense of anything
[02:47:49] <[itchyjunk]> using infinite loops, probably
[02:48:00] <[itchyjunk]> yes that is what i was confused
[02:48:02] <sonny> that's how oop works?
[02:48:08] <[itchyjunk]> whos is calling what, when how type thing
[02:48:08] <flakland> though they try to brush it all under the rug and call it "syntacti c sugar"
[02:48:16] <sonny> lol
[02:48:21] <[itchyjunk]> flakland, what language do you use?
[02:48:41] <flakland> right now C
[02:50:26] <[itchyjunk]> you don't use "seperation of concern" there?
[02:50:34] <sonny> though I've yet to see oop where it's truly used for encapsulating state to one object, that does sound appealing
[02:50:39] <[itchyjunk]> main.c calls somethingelse.c that calles somethingelseelse.c
[02:50:59] <flakland> theres nothign separate when "control" instantiates the objects we're concerned about
[02:51:03] <sonny> in c, the main abstraction is just a procedure
[02:51:09] <flakland> its smoke and mirrors
[02:51:13] <sonny> ^
[02:51:30] <Decker> and vtables (structs with function pointers)
[02:51:47] <[itchyjunk]> no it doesn't instantiate the objects
[02:51:54] <[itchyjunk]> it tells gamestate to instantiate
[02:52:12] <[itchyjunk]> this.gameState.addGameObject(new BlueCircle(0.0));
[02:52:30] <[itchyjunk]> it tells gamestate that the state is to be changed and a new blueball is to be created

[05:13:19] <lantech19446> the only thing that's keeping me coming back is the desire to be able to make something that will help me eventually. Every time I was manic I had this weird desire to learn programming, it would only last as long as my mania did but it was the one thing I wanted to learn and now that i'm feeling better I can really do it.
[05:16:43] <[itchyjunk]> i have similar issue
[05:16:46] <[itchyjunk]> i wanna learn everything
[05:16:52] <[itchyjunk]> but it only lasts a short burst
[05:17:04] <[itchyjunk]> and i don't get pass the first hump ever
[05:17:23] <jeaye> lantech19446: Nothing wrong with learning JS first. The difficult part of learning your first language is that you're not just learning the language; you're learning how to program. That includes how to think like a programmer. Once you can program comfortably in one language, learning most other languages will be much easier, since most of them build on the same concepts, just with different
[05:17:25] <jeaye> syntax or semantics.

[05:19:19] <jeaye> lantech19446: Both JS and Python are very useful languages. Make sure you learn enough of one of them to be able to write whatever you want before you jump into the next, though. Otherwise you won't be getting the most out of either.

[05:22:23] <jeaye> lantech19446: At an early stage, one of things which slows people down the most is decision paralysis. That is, there are too many things to learn and they want to choose the "right" one or "best" one and a lot of time is spent not fully committing to anything.
[05:23:17] <lantech19446> yea i've been trapped in that for the last week or so
[05:23:22] <jeaye> :)
[05:23:46] <jeaye> Just pick something and run with it. You'll have plenty of time to learn more langs afterward. As you get more experienced, you may be writing in multiple langs per day or per week, depending on what's needed.
[05:24:16] <jeaye> But having a strong foundation in one language will help you a lot.
[05:25:16] <apotheon> lantech19446: I thought we already arrived at a nice conclusion of language choice.

[05:27:20] <jeaye> Having an opinion and pulling a new comer toward it are two different things.

[05:28:20] <dre> I'll decide for you 
[05:28:26] <[itchyjunk]> I told him to learn py since he wants to learn that anyways.
[05:28:36] <apotheon> lantech19446: Okay.  I recommend (primarily) staying with JavaScript for a couple years, then, unless it becomes a very limiting factor for you.
[05:28:38] <jeaye> Python is not "easier" than JS.
[05:28:43] <dre> learning javascript maeans you also kinda have to learn html
[05:28:46] <jeaye> They both have pros and cons.
[05:28:49] <dre> which is not always a given. 
[05:28:53] <TCZ> haha
[05:28:57] <lantech19446> dre I know html and css already
[05:29:12] <Fault> javascript has a "pro" that no other language has though: runs natively in browsers
[05:29:15] <dre> oh ok
[05:29:21] <jeaye> dre JS can run outside the browser. Learning JS doesn't mean making web pages, necessarily.
[05:29:25] <lantech19446> yea i've been studying webdev the last few months
[05:29:27] <apotheon> lantech19446: In general, I think that every time you start over on a new language before you've reached some practical level of facility with one of them, you add a couple years to your ability to reach that level of facility, because you're mostly just doing the same stuff over again.

[07:49:50] <ircuser> adder you need a history lesson sir
[07:49:56] <ircuser> programming came from applied maths
[07:50:06] <ircuser> in 20th century they were same at one point 
[07:50:20] <sonny> how did it come from applied maths??
[07:50:28] <pulse> They diverged considerably since then :P
[07:50:30] <sonny> what? lol
[07:50:34] <ircuser> now the maths guys are starting to realize they can't get jobs and are billing themselves as our specialty 
[07:50:39] <computerquip> In my experience, the skilled people tend to be more friendly since they seem to feel less threatened. 
[07:50:42] <stoned> In 1837, Charles Babbage was inspired by Jacquard's loom to attempt to build the Analytical Engine

[07:51:56] <stoned> The names of the components of the calculating device were borrowed from the textile industry. In the textile industry, yarn was brought from the store to be milled. The device had a "store" which was memory to hold 1,000 numbers of 40 decimal digits each. Numbers from the "store" were transferred to the "mill" for processing. It was programmed using two sets of perforated cards. One set to
[07:51:58] <stoned> direct the operation and the other for the input variables.

[07:54:01] <pulse> Last I checked they can't code very well
[07:54:06] <leduyquang753> I would say programming uses some products from mathematics like how biology for example takes it from chemistry.
[07:54:13] <pulse> They have a different job, that applies to different sets of problems
[07:54:14] <ircuser> theyre getting better with automated tools and machine learning 
[07:54:16] <ircuser> automation 
[07:54:20] <pulse> ircuser, Lol. No
[07:54:23] <ircuser> the very tools real programmers create 
[07:54:32] <pulse> You can't design a complex system with any amount of ML

[07:57:58] <ircuser> then all is lost

[07:58:23] <ircuser> pulse yes its absurd
[07:58:28] <pulse> [itchyjunk], Yeah but that's because the operation of folding proteins is reducible
[07:58:28] <ircuser> most chefs do not need a PhD lol

[07:58:38] <[itchyjunk]> pulse, reducible to what?
[07:58:44] <pulse> Well, maybe it is, idk
[07:58:49] <pulse> [itchyjunk], To some kind of atomic operations
[07:58:55] <[itchyjunk]> it's clearly not reducible because you would have non predictive solutions to

[07:59:54] <pulse> [itchyjunk], To a degree, but not in-depth
[08:00:08] <[itchyjunk]> if you keep up with state of the art and say that then sure
[08:00:13] <adder> I remember I heard that a drone was able to complete a complex track a lot faster than a drone operated by a skilled human operator

[08:00:18] <[itchyjunk]> but NLP models have gottaon way better in just 10 years

[08:00:27] <sonny> lol
[08:00:29] <sonny> nice
[08:00:29] <pulse> The problem with AI and ML is that as soon as you have a variable that's unaccounted for, the whole system collapses. Humans can work out extra variables, ML can't
[08:00:32] <[itchyjunk]> now you have transformers 
[08:00:41] <pulse> So all we can really do is envelop the world around such a system more and more

[09:13:55] <aoei\Chickatrice> my odds were also slim cuz i had no experience in a prior corporate job, so my hitrate per initial application (resume -> screening call) was trash
[09:13:57] <The_Blode_> Easiest in this case is subjective.
[09:14:29] <sonny> nah, I just can't count lol
[09:14:30] <The_Blode_> Yeah I hadn't considered experience or anything. Let me tell you from my own experience...tenure / professional experience might be a myth. Let me explain though.
[09:15:03] <aoei\Chickatrice> but conversions weree good for later steps (Hr screen: show you can talk and act like a normal person, technical interview will be fine if you know your shit well enough)
[09:15:08] <sonny> not tenure, I studied the wrong prog, should've done eng instead of cs

[09:16:12] <aoei\Chickatrice> doesn't mean professional experience is generally useless
[09:16:30] <The_Blode_> I can't go into specifics but the point is, tenure / professional experience as your only thing is not enough. It's not how much time you do something, it's what you have achieved in that time. That's my theory.

[15:39:40] <CalimeroTeknik> writing assembly without comments does obfuscate your intent, like renaming everything in your code as "a", "b", "c" etc would

[15:40:40] <The_Blode_> Do you write any Assembly CalimeroTeknik ?
[15:40:58] <The_Blode_> Would you say it's a useful skill to have on the CV?
[15:41:30] <pyzozord> totally depends on where you apply your cv
[15:41:50] <pyzozord> in my case a frontend web developer it is not useful at all theoretically
[15:42:05] <The_Blode_> Could I pivot to compiled apps?
[15:42:05] <pyzozord> but pratically it signals that I am passionate about computers and programming in general
[15:42:14] <The_Blode_> Is that wise given the way the world is right now?
[15:43:11] <pyzozord> i think you worry about the how but you still don't have what figured out
[15:43:29] <The_Blode_> Yep you're right
[15:44:23] <pyzozord> imma have a coffee
[15:44:26] <pyzozord> i just decided
[15:44:38] <pyzozord> not because I need to, but because I want to
[15:44:53] <pyzozord> I want coffee roughly few cups every few months
[15:45:44] <pyzozord> looking forward to doing some more serious work finally

[15:55:35] <fweht> if i have a floating point number with 16 bits mantissa and i want to create a new number with exponent 1 and the same mantissa only first and second half swapped,  i can do `fract(pow(2.0, 8.0 - floor(log(a) / log(2.0))) * a + a / pow(2.0, 16.0))` where `fract` is mod 1?  or am i completely confused?
[15:55:48] <CalimeroTeknik> The_Blode_, I already provided my piece about the uses of assembly before you asked your question. And what I do myself is mostly irrelevant to your career prospects
[15:57:15] <fweht> aaah im confused im sorry, will ask again later!
[15:58:09] <mawk> you need to use bitwise operations fweht 
[15:58:23] <fweht> mawk: i know but webgl 1.0 dont have those!
[15:58:35] <CalimeroTeknik> what is this about swapping mantissa halves?
[15:58:45] <fweht> i want to create a pseudo random number generator
[15:58:53] <mawk> you can't use integers?
[15:59:03] <fweht> where it takes as input the distance of the fragment to a given point and then puts the less significant bits in front
[15:59:14] <fweht> i can use integers but bitwise operations are not defined
[15:59:29] <fweht> but webgl 1.0 will die soon anyway so maybe i should ignore it
[15:59:36] <mawk> bitwise operations are just division and modulo anyway
[15:59:49] <mawk> by powers of 2
[15:59:51] <mawk> more or less
[15:59:55] <fweht> yeah, thats what i tried to emulate with my program
[16:00:18] <CalimeroTeknik> fweht, there's an interesting suggestion for a PRNG for shaders in this video:  https://youtu.be/X-iSQQgOd1A at 10mn54s

[16:00:57] <fweht> awesome video, thank you!
[16:01:15] <mawk> if the float is > 1 you can divide it by the ceiling of its integer part
[16:01:21] <mawk> that's like setting the exponent to 1
[16:01:30] <mawk> well not exactly
[16:01:30] <CalimeroTeknik> not sure how webGL will play ball with that but the code is on screen at 10mn57s so
[16:01:46] <mawk> but it's giving you a float between 0 and 1
[16:02:17] <fweht> yeah i think i understand the basics but i just did a stupid mistake in my code

[19:03:44] <Decker> an implementation of JSOX in Python would explore that sort of thing... since you can specify a type of object with a prefixed string  `"typeName"{object:"definition"}` ... so then taking the object (or array) and using it to revive a specific class of thing 'typeName'...
[19:04:12] <Decker> although if there's no paritcular handler for it, in JS, I just create a generic {} to use as the prototype, and all of those objects I pass the same {} as their prototype...

[22:33:46] <apotheon> bruda: Every time you get introduced to a function in K&R, look up the OpenBSD manpage for it to learn about what you might consider using instead.
[22:33:54] <pyzozord> bruda: yes, second edition
[22:34:02] <bruda> Ok then I got the right one.
[22:34:13] <renlo> CalimeroTeknik: if the majority of people say it, it's correct imo
[22:34:47] <bruda> That book still sells for nearly $40. Glad I have my old PDF copy from years ago.
[22:35:19] <renlo> and, if a person said "typewriter poetry" the meaning is clear; poetry written on a typewriter. "C programming" is clear; noun/verb coding in C
[22:35:22] <pyzozord> bruda: it's not exhaustive but drills you where it's important, on pointers and arrays
[22:35:56] <apotheon> renlo: I've actually seen poetry about typewriters, so I'm not sure people will always understand that "typeweriter poetry" means poetry written on a typewriter.

[22:40:06] <CalimeroTeknik> some oral poetry isn't even writable (due to phonetic ambiguity)
[22:40:10] <renlo> well, "C programming" is elliptical but most often unambiguous

[22:40:41] <pyzozord> bruda: that's a big features of the book, it's short and simple, and also full of goodies. That's very inline with the philosophy of the langue. The book has been written by the creator of the language and his long time colleague
[22:40:46] <CalimeroTeknik> renlo, here's my problem: I can't even define a well-formed meaning compatible with what the books that say "C programming" on their cover are about
[22:41:23] <CalimeroTeknik> if you can help me out, I would like it, but it's probably desperate as I have good proof that it's impossible to produce a well-formed definition in that vein

[23:30:27] <jeaye> C is a simpler language, in its design, but it's not as easy to use, since it requires so much manual work from the developer.
[23:30:27] <user51> it feels like since i already have a stack and do some operations on it, it's maybe 50% in

[23:30:50] <flakland> for someone who claims to be such an expert

[23:58:24] <jeaye> We must be working on different types of software.
[23:58:25] <CalimeroTeknik> I also hate how C++ attempts type conversion before telling you its attempts at interpreting your obviously invalid code failed ^^

[23:58:51] <pulse> Don't get me wrong, I love C++ myself
[23:58:55] <pulse> It's very expressive
[23:59:04] <pulse> But I want to do a C-only game eventually
[23:59:10] <pulse> Just because I find C fun as hell
[23:59:29] <pulse> And I don't worry about UB because, you know ... single player game
[23:59:36] <pulse> Worst that can happen is the game crashes

[23:59:44] <jeaye> People finding C as a good language to write new programs in keeps the security researches employed, so good on them.
[23:59:59] <pulse> Again, security is only an issue in critical domains
