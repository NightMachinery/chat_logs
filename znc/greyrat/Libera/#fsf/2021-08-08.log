[15:17:12] <xormor> belgin, I am learning C. I never quite learned to program the proper way, to seek solutions to problems and solve them. So I take snippets of code and debug them. I make small changes to small pieces of code. The code could be a big game like omega-rpg or a small program. I actually learned to display memory addresses and creation and deletion numbers of objects in C++. I called the objects "worlds". I made an array of them, like world_creation world[i] 
[15:17:12] <xormor> = new world; or something like that. I have the source. I can link the address here.

[15:50:23] <xormor> kompowiec, so "free sofware" is about idealism and politics, and a social construct. I think it sounds a bit like anarcho-socialism to me. "open source" is about practicality - lots of eyes and fingers to fix bugs. "free software" is about freedom, and "open source" is about the way a piece of software or several are developed. people can look at the source code of both kinds of software. most "open source" is "free libre software" as well.
[15:53:37] <kompowiec> free software it's ideology
[15:53:52] <kompowiec> open source is her poor abomination
[15:56:53] <kompowiec> and free software it isn't communism/socialism. People say that because they are stupid and compare the world of information to the IRL.
[15:58:50] <xormor> in the old world conservatism was anti-idealist and anti-ideology. liberalism is idealism and an ideology. ideologies can be practical or impractical, but they may be seemingly radical at first, but then they become the norm and are considered conservative or liberal, and people do not even notice how they have grown to support an ideology starting from childhood, youth or adulthood, before they are middle-aged.

[16:00:15] <xormor> kompowiec, I think free software is liberalism. The ideology is about freedom, not price. Conservative ideology usually states that a religion, the state and the home are the values, and liberalism states that freedom is the value.

[16:02:26] <kompowiec> IP it's based on violence. I have no problem with it, if someone makes it available some under his license, his business. But if the same person abuses me because, for example, I pirated his product, I will always point out that he is using aggression.
[16:02:48] <kompowiec> intellectual property =! material property
[16:03:06] <kompowiec> it is impossible to defend IP without interfering with other people's property.
[16:04:03] <lightbringer> Imaginary Property
[16:04:41] <kompowiec> heh, yeah
[16:11:11] <xormor> I was a part of leftist youth organization from 2008 to 2010, and their propaganda magazine said "copyright was used by Mussolini's fascist state Italy", and "intellectual property" is something Stallman does not want to use as an expression, because it mixes concepts. He would rather talk about "proprietary software", "non-free software" and "free libre software". He thinks information should be freely shared, changed, studied and the changed copies 
[16:11:11] <xormor> should be shared too. The 4 freedoms.
