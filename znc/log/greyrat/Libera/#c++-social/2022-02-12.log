[04:46:27] <Crocodillian> hi
[04:48:49] <Crocodillian> I forget, are you the cell phone guy
[04:53:19] <Zogatribe> yeah
[04:55:10] <Crocodillian> what do you think about the current state of cell phones, ios or android?
[04:56:06] <Zogatribe> don't have a view; I left the industry in 2003
[04:56:18] <Crocodillian> which one do you have
[04:56:36] <Zogatribe> I have a mid-range cheap chinese android
[04:56:43] <Crocodillian> nice
[04:56:58] <Crocodillian> IMO that's the most reasonable option
[04:59:01] <Crocodillian> I was doing some termux related stuff a couple months ago, need to get back into that
[04:59:19] <Zogatribe> no idea what that is
[04:59:30] <Crocodillian> it's like a linux distro thing for android
[04:59:53] <Zogatribe> linux sucks
[05:00:00] <Crocodillian> sure
[05:00:22] <Crocodillian> I won't disagree there at all
[05:00:22] <Zogatribe> non-linux suck more
[05:00:39] <Zogatribe> although apple's OS is UNIX
[05:00:45] <Zogatribe> UNIX > linux
[05:00:57] <Crocodillian> I've been doing lots of windows things the past couple of months because these cunts turned my linux a disgusting shade of yellow
[05:01:10] <Crocodillian> but I needed to do that anyway
[05:01:18] <Zogatribe> and Windows is micro-kernel hybrid; micro-kernal > monolithic (linux)
[05:01:31] <Crocodillian> NT is awesome
[05:01:35] <Crocodillian> but windows is not NT
[05:01:46] <Crocodillian> if it was it would be much more awesome
[05:01:46] <Zogatribe> Windows kernal is NT
[05:01:53] <Crocodillian> yeah that's what I meant
[05:01:57] <Zogatribe> kernel*
[05:02:36] <Crocodillian> Win32 greatly limits the power NT would have
[05:03:03] <Crocodillian> like it can't survive a fork() for example
[05:03:36] <Zogatribe> AFAIK you can't fork processes in Windows
[05:03:53] <Crocodillian> the kernel does not stop you from doing that
[05:03:57] <Crocodillian> win32 does
[05:04:05] <Crocodillian> but that's just one issue with it
[05:04:13] <Zogatribe> I don't want to fork processes though: threads are a thing
[05:04:40] <Crocodillian> sure, that's not what I meant though
[05:05:41] <Crocodillian> I also don't particularly like threads
[05:05:53] <Crocodillian> I think threads should be used cpu thread compute only
[05:06:01] <Crocodillian> and io should be async with coroutines
[05:06:11] <Zogatribe> I don't like forks
[05:06:19] <Crocodillian> I don't particularly like them either
[05:06:43] <Zogatribe> never used coroutines
[05:07:08] <Crocodillian> ever used any event based async stuff?
[05:07:10] <Zogatribe> I have been coding since 1984 without coroutines; I see no need to start using them now
[05:16:08] <Zogatribe> however I may have no choice if I am to implement various languages that use them

[05:21:43] <Crocodillian> look at boost.asio if you are a C++ fan

[06:35:19] <Crocodillian> Zogatribe: well that's what I meant by async io
[06:35:46] <Crocodillian> Zogatribe: lots of languages support this, but the most beautiful implementation I've seen was gevent in python
[06:40:39] <Zogatribe> python is toy.
[06:41:17] <Crocodillian> yeah but if you need some quick glue and duct tape it's one of the best things by far
[06:41:41] <Crocodillian> it has modules for everything imaginable
[06:42:01] <Crocodillian> that are actually not complete garbage
[06:42:20] <Zogatribe> it is popular which is why I am going to implement it first
[06:42:48] <Crocodillian> also there's a jit for it now called pypy, it's amazingly fast
[06:43:10] <Zogatribe> not as fast as it could be
[06:43:37] <Crocodillian> probably not
[06:43:48] <Zogatribe> mine will be faster
[06:47:08] <Crocodillian> there's a PEP for types, would make it much easier to jit
[06:47:43] <Crocodillian> but shouldn't really matter for basic types because python already does that
[06:57:27] <Crocodillian> not sure what you'd really want to optimize, processing loops with basic types mainly, pypy probably does that pretty well
[06:58:58] <Crocodillian> it's hard to get around things like method calls being hash lookups in a dynamic language like python, but that shouldn't matter that much generally

[09:09:32] <Crocodillian> hnOsmium0001[m]: yeah I dunno how much it would actually help, and normal variables already have a string/int type, and I'm sure things like pypy use that
[09:17:12] <Renderwww> I'm all out of halp ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[09:19:12] <Faux> I'm all out of a lot of things.
[09:19:34] <Crocodillian> pypy is actually amazingly fast, I did an unscientific test with a small program, and even given that it has to do the parsing step, it was faster than the equivalent go program
[09:20:04] <Crocodillian> go is such utter shit it doesn't even compile properly
[09:21:55] <Renderwww> Faux: at least you have a giraffics card
[09:22:17] <Crocodillian> me too, because I have a real laptop not an iDildo
[09:23:07] <Crocodillian> actually I should try making a hackintosh partition, but then again qemu works so well for this purpose there's no point
[09:24:55] <Crocodillian> some guy even implemented the m1 cpu in it
[09:27:07] <Renderwww> so you can run java compiled to x86 emulated in m1 vm on a x64 host where the cpu deep down has a risc architecture, peak emulation!
[09:27:07] <Crocodillian> I could use that to make my arm64 builds, but I'd rather make a cross build script
[09:27:34] <Renderwww> or instead of java some electron bloat
[09:28:19] <Crocodillian> Renderwww: no you should run windows firefox with webasm qemu to run linux to run qemu to run windows to run cygwin to run your Linux Enterprise Server
[09:31:00] <Crocodillian> the level of security will be unimaginable
[09:34:25] <Crocodillian> but more seriously, if you want a build server for mac apps, qemu is pretty much your only option
[09:41:30] <Crocodillian> unless you want to stash a mac mini in some corner of your house, but that's not particularly reliable
[09:42:15] <jotham> wish faux would send me his gpu
[09:42:19] <jotham> maybe cpu too
[09:42:29] <jotham> so he can spend more time being a family man

[09:59:18] <Crocodillian> of course you have to not be stupid enough to contact apple support about your hack vm, which some people have done
[09:59:27] <jotham> theydo you have an iphone Crocodillian 
[09:59:50] <Crocodillian> no I have an android, blackberry key2
[10:00:00] <Crocodillian> and I've never built a mobile app yet

[10:02:21] <Crocodillian> don't really blame them, hard to make a phone with like 3 people
[10:03:10] <Crocodillian> but generally when you make a mobile app you try to target both android and ios if possible
[10:03:32] <jotham> why do you care about ios
[10:03:51] <jotham> we had a cunt of a time shoehorning an ios drm into android last year
[10:04:22] <Crocodillian> I would care about ios if I was making a mobile app, because people use it
