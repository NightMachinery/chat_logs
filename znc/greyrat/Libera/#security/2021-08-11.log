[00:00:11] <simbaclaws> I'm getting the Camera G4 Bullet from ubiquiti, mounted on a spot outside where they can't reach it
[00:00:15] <simbaclaws> is that an idea?
[00:00:36] <simbaclaws> monitoring the only entry points of my home

[00:03:01] *** Joins: cvmn (~caveman@gateway/tor-sasl/caveman)
[00:03:49] <`St0ner> and for outside camera installs, ground the cabling and devices properly on both ends
[00:04:56] <simbaclaws> I have no idea how to do this, I'm a complete and utter newb
[00:05:06] <TimMc> simbaclaws: I ran the 'motion' apt package on a shitty old laptop with a shitty old USB camera for quite some time to try to catch a package thief.
[00:05:11] <simbaclaws> this one has night and day and IR support
[00:05:35] <simbaclaws> mounting is my only issue, I think I can handle the software side of things
[00:05:45] <TimMc> The thief never came back but I did find out who took my tomatoes.
[00:06:48] <TimMc> It worked fine as an offline solution. Just make sure the "server" and camera aren't in plain sight.
[00:07:22] <`St0ner> one lightning strike or even major voltage differential in the air can kill your camera and/or the switch/router its attached to
[00:08:43] <`St0ner> ubiquiti does sell the in-line ethernet surge protectors, usually you need one grounded at the camera and another one grounded on the wall where the cable enters the premises
[00:08:46] <Hash> What are some good open source and free UTM Universal threat manageemnt software I can try out and learn
[00:08:48] <Hash> htank you
[00:08:52] <Hash> Thank ou*
[00:08:53] <Hash> you*
[00:08:54] <Apachez> use poe+, the poe switch is connected to UPS with surge protection, then from there you have fiber to your other devices
[00:09:06] <Apachez> also make sure to have this camera network fully isolated from your internal stuff
[00:09:32] <Apachez> would be a bad day if someone takes a ladder and connects their own wifi ap to your tp and gain access to your stuff that way :P
[00:09:33] <`St0ner> i was assuming PoE in the above
[00:10:03] <simbaclaws> isolation as in virtual lans?
[00:10:10] <simbaclaws> or as in air gapped network?
[00:11:07] <`St0ner> i believe ubiquiti requires both ends of the PoE camera to have the grounded PoE surge protectors installed for warranty. and you may need cat cabling that has a ground wire too
[00:11:39] <`St0ner> which means your router/switch on the inside needs metal sockets
[00:12:32] <`St0ner> or you can use an ethernet->fiber bridge for the outside run and eliminate all such grounding issues
[00:14:22] <MadCamel> I went with one of those ethernet via powerline adapters and a poe injector. Power outlet is a lot closer than my switch.
[00:15:12] <simbaclaws> well I have a wall socket that goes to a spot in a closet, and then from there goes to another wallsocket near my setup where I wsant to put a switch
[00:15:41] <simbaclaws> so I'd have 2 switches and a wall socket between the camera and router
[00:16:00] <simbaclaws> but ther'es going to be 2 camera's so I'd probably have a similar setup for my other camera
[00:16:26] <`St0ner> just be aware of ground differentials between the camera's location outside and the ground inside. if you tie into to different grounds, you'll also have a problem
[00:17:26] <simbaclaws> I'll try to find an expert who knows how to properly mount these things.
[00:17:33] <simbaclaws> not so sure where I can find those in my area
[00:18:30] <simbaclaws> I also still have to change my T568b wirings inside of the walls in my wall sockets to T568a, for some reason the contractor thought it'd be funny to use T568b
[00:18:46] <simbaclaws> who uses that these days?
[00:19:03] <simbaclaws> I can't plugin a cable and expect it to work
[00:20:56] <MadCamel> er, as long as both ends of the run are terminated correctly, a to a or b to b, it shouldn't matter
[00:22:28] <ajak> yeah, this sounds like maybe an XY problem?

[00:39:10] <ajak> the router has no visibility into the colors of wires in the cable you plug into it
[00:39:15] <ajak> if the cable works, it'll work
[00:42:36] <simbaclaws> ok I'll try that instead then
[00:43:01] <simbaclaws> we used a ethernet cable tester and it said that somer wires were reversed
[00:43:08] <simbaclaws> so I'm guessing it's because of T568b
[00:44:13] <ajak> won't it work as long as both ends are the same?

[15:47:14] <Preston> Hey everyone quick question about Bitwarden, everyone keeps saying that Bitwarden handles encrypting / decrypting your passwords on the client side and sends it's hash to your online vault so that even it doesn't know what your passwords are, which is cool. But, if I were to get a new device and install Bitwarden on it and login, how is it possible I can still reverse my hashes? Where is it
[15:47:16] <Preston> getting the key to do that? Is it generated when logging in with my original credentials?
[15:47:38] <Preston> I'm trying to look up risks of using a password manager like this but everyone just parrots what they've read everywhere else I'm just searching for some real answers

[17:39:59] <TimMc> There are a bunch of ways they could be doing it. The simplest would be to derive the key directly from the master password, but then you can't change the master password without re-encrypting everything.
[17:40:44] *** Joins: Warped (~Warped@user/warped)
[17:41:17] <TimMc> But without looking at their docs, here's my guess: The decryption key is probably generated at setup, then the master password is run through a PBKDF to generate a master key; the decryption key is itself encrypted with the master key and stored on the server.
[17:41:27] <TimMc> That's the way several of these services work.
[17:42:16] <TimMc> Then there would likely be a mechanism with which you authenticate with them, again using the master password (but maybe this time bcrypt'd or with a PAKE or whatever) before they'll send you the encrypted data encryption key and encrypted passwords.
[17:42:43] <TimMc> There may be other elements such as a device key, etc, but that's likely the general shape of it.

[19:48:47] <Bully> piou, https://www.privacyaffairs.com/vpn-protocols/ something else to look at
[19:48:48] <MadCamel> I've seen exploits that pull the credentials file from the filesystem.. even on linux. It wouldn't surprise me if one were crafted to yoink the file + decryption key from memory.
[19:48:54] <rts> This is a cool password manager https://lesspass.com/#/
[19:49:03] <rts> there is no storage on disk
[19:49:27] <rts> ah, but memory ...
[19:49:55] <rts> hello
[19:50:09] <skill> i'm not going to judge your threat model there, but I bet most password managers have some sort of in-memory caching. I'm not familiar on what timeout settings they offer
[19:50:11] <Bully> I've got to say I am a sucker for bitwarden. It's either that or a notepad and a safe for me at the moment
[19:50:17] <piou> I wonder what can call the Firefox password API. If an extension can then this opens a lot of attacks besides in-memory ones, in the same way as a program may exploiting the sudo cache delay to run things as root doesn't need to grab the sudo token from memory.
[19:50:51] <skill> I'm sure Mozilla has that documented somewhere
[19:50:58] <skill> afaik, it's not exposed to extensions
[19:51:43] <TimMc> For better or worse, yeah.

[19:53:48] *** Parts: rts (~nly@122.161.78.23) ()
[19:54:57] <piou> Also, there are common threat models where memory stealing is part of the game, the most common one being if you consider the police a threat. Note that I'm not talking about the justice system as a whole, a judge can always ask you to provide your credentials and it'll rarely be worth your while to refuse, but if you have controversial content at least it needs to go before a judge first and the
[19:54:59] *** Joins: oxum (~oxum@122.172.62.99)

[19:56:32] *** Joins: technonerd (~techno@user/technonerd)
[19:56:48] <MadCamel> threat model's simple. last ff exploit I examined contained a payload to steal a bunch of files. like cookies and history and any crypto wallets in your homedir. By its nature the exploit gains arbitrary code execution in the browser so there's no reason it couldn't steal the keychain passphrase as well. the author just didn't think of it.
[19:56:55] <skill> but law enforcement can subpoena the data form the websites themselves.
[19:57:49] <skill> MadCamel: sure, if an exploit can run/attach to the FF process, i'd just go for the data itself vs the passwords. But that's just me
[19:58:13] <piou> skill: that's a whole lot of additional work though, and again involves the justice system and not just the police. Besides it may not work at all, for example if the website is hosted in another country.Â So this definitely doesn't make the police threat model invalid for this case.
[19:59:05] <skill> piou: i think exploiting a target requires a lot of work, as well. But we all have our threat models.
[19:59:16] <skill> I don't know of any password manager that automatically seals the vault after use.
[19:59:30] <piou> skill: I'm not sure what you're refering to by "exploiting a target" here
[19:59:54] <skill> piou: you say that going after a target's process memory is less work than subpoena.

[20:00:24] *** Quits: signofzeta (~signofzet@user/signofzeta) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:00:51] <piou> skill: yes, because capturing live memory is very standard for the police when they suspect that computers may be involved, and it does not involve getting permission from a whole other governemental body
[20:00:52] *** Joins: signofzeta (~signofzet@user/signofzeta)
[20:01:19] <skill> piou: afaik, for the police to seize your computer, that requires a warrant.
[20:01:39] <skill> also, by the time the police seizes your equipment, most in-memory things are gone unless they happen to catch you and prevent you from locking your laptop
[20:01:44] <skill> (or putting it to sleep)
[20:02:03] <skill> piou: but, that may only apply in countries where a warrant is needed. I'm sure there are places where they can just take it
[20:02:21] <piou> Yeah, it works a bit differently in France typically
[20:02:39] <skill> i wasn't aware that in France the police can just walk up and take your shit
[20:03:16] <piou> Frankly, that's complicated and as a French I'm not sure I understand it fully
[20:03:28] <piou> What's certain is that we don't have the same concept of warrants as in the US
[20:03:45] <piou> Far fewer things require judiciary oversight
[20:04:02] <MadCamel> when thinking about such things I always just assume that the police will not follow the law.
[20:04:09] <skill> keep in mind, we don't need a big judiciary involvement fo ra warrant, you just need a judge to sign it

[21:55:41] <cmnky> anyone watching the "Mike Lindell Cyber Symposium on Election Security" ?
[21:57:35] <cmnky> its actually fairly interesting stuff, they are doing a better job than I expected, on rumble 'RSBN' channel if you're interested
[21:59:54] <ajak> PaCkEtS
[22:00:04] <`St0ner> no, thought it would be stupid as hell
[22:00:18] <`St0ner> that guy knows nothing about computers
[22:00:27] <`St0ner> evident from his many public interviews
[22:00:38] <ajak> he's a crank pillow salesman, i don't know what anyone expects, lol
[22:01:09] <cmnky> yes, Lindell knows nothing about computers, and says crazy stuff, but theres technical people present, and they are slowly making a case
[22:01:24] <`St0ner> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBlgrjIE-Zw is the most recent public interview i watched, from 3 days ago
[22:01:27] *** Parts: bewees (~quassel@user/bewees) (https://quassel-irc.org - Komfortabler Chat. Ãœberall.)
[22:01:35] <cmnky> so if you're interested in security, and you can set aside the politically motivated voice in your head, its not terrible, thats all I'm saying
[22:02:10] <cmnky> the data analysis talk yesterday morning was particular good, right now they are looking at files on the voting machine image
[22:02:52] <skill> there are good people there trying to remain neutral
[22:03:02] <skill> but so far no actual data has been provided to either prove or disprove the claims
[22:03:09] <`St0ner> in that cnn interview, cnn said they ran his files from the voting machines by 9 or 10 different computer security university researchers across the country, all having PhDs, and they all said his files were just metadata that doesnt show anything useful
[22:03:09] <ajak> gasp!
[22:03:14] <skill> they mentioned a lot these packet captures, but so far no packet captures have been provided
[22:03:22] <skill> and the only files provided were RTF files with al ist of IP addresses
[22:03:23] <cmnky> skill ... they have not connected the dots from end to end yet, agreed
[22:03:26] <skill> that was xxd encoded.
[22:03:34] <skill> because 'cyber guys' like hex data.
[22:03:44] <skill> and the question now is
[22:03:54] <[iz]> oh shit, your computer is broadcasting an ip address
[22:03:58] <`St0ner> and if you want some humor and more examples of how little lindell knows about computers, this jimmy kimmel interview is quite funny https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2N27160HKs
[22:04:02] <skill> how did they obtain these 'forensic images' of the voting machines, what do they prove? config changes don't mean fraud, and how did they obtain them?
[22:04:06] <ajak> if mike lindell has incriminating packet captures of voting machine data that's an election security issue in itself
[22:04:24] <[iz]> ip address show in hex!  this proves it
[22:04:28] <`St0ner> lindell doesnt have shit
[22:04:35] <skill> and computer A talking to computer B doesn't mean a hack.
[22:04:39] <cmnky> skill, they said they got the voting machine images from county clerks who wanted the machines investigated
[22:04:59] <skill> cmnky: sure. how legal is that, that's the question
[22:05:06] <cmnky> skill, Lindells data guy 'Dr. Frank' apparently does this for a living, analyzes voting results for various localities
[22:05:06] <skill> but also what are the voting machine images are going to prove?
[22:05:29] <skill> The same Dr Frank that was caught filling HDDs with random data because he had no actual data for his prior fraud claim
[22:05:48] <skill> if=/dev/urandom of=/mnt/drive SEE ALL THE FRAUD
[22:05:49] <cmnky> noone knows what a system image is going to reveal, until they get it and analyze it, which is why the FBI raids peoples houses at 4am and takes all the media
[22:05:57] <`St0ner> also, allegedly the US government and military have multiple branches having cybersecurity experts, and allegedly they thoroughly examined all of this voting machine business. lindell thinks they're all wrong? who do you think is more credible?
[22:06:02] <skill> the FBI raided the houses of those people
[22:06:09] <skill> because they were sharing exactly this equipment and passwords online
[22:06:15] <skill> so now all this voting infrastructure is useless
[22:06:24] <skill> enjoy how your tax money is being used.
[22:06:46] <skill> but i'd be extremely surprised if any actual provable data is shown and shared
[22:07:03] <ajak> well, we're not the audience for these things
[22:07:04] <cmnky> you seem awfully dismissive of a situation where evidence speaks for itself
[22:07:05] <skill> i highly doubt voting machines are built with 'if trump flip to biden' logic. and if true, an OS image won't reveal that
[22:07:15] <skill> cmnky: what evidence?
[22:07:24] <[iz]> oh man, don't feed the troll
[22:07:25] <`St0ner> in the CNN interview, they went to the actual voting machines that lindell alleges were breached
[22:07:34] <skill> [iz]: just playing along for a bit :)
[22:07:35] <cmnky> the evidence being presented over this 3 day event
[22:07:41] <skill> lol ok
[22:07:46] <[iz]> that's exactly what he wants though
[22:07:50] <ajak> cmnky | skill ... they have not connected the dots from end to end yet, agreed
[22:07:55] <cmnky> again, you're laughing and being emotional over "data"
[22:07:56] <`St0ner> those machines read and count PAPER ballots. so the electronic data is a backup to the paper copies
[22:08:00] <skill> i guess we'll wait and see this magical evidence
[22:08:01] <`St0ner> and the paper copies were hand-verified
[22:08:03] <[iz]> he's not really that dumb
[22:08:07] <skill> cmnky: i am, data makes me cry and laugh at the same time
[22:08:12] <cmnky> I'm not making any claims as to how this will end
[22:08:14] <skill> just the thought of data, and i need tissues
[22:08:25] <cmnky> lookup the word 'impartial' in the dictionary
[22:08:34] <skill> same bud
[22:08:40] <skill> but let's wait and see this evidence
[22:08:52] <ajak> i think you're kidding yourself if you think impartial means "give the idiots a chance"
[22:08:53] <cmnky> its fine to be skeptical, you can be skeptical while looking at the data
[22:09:01] * ajak waits for the "data"
[22:09:10] <`St0ner> everyone's been waiting almost a year for lindell's evidence. you'd think if he had any, he'd disclose it sooner
[22:09:11] <cmnky> as long as you view the data impartially, and avoid dismissing it automatically due to your skepticism
[22:09:22] <ajak> what data?
[22:09:28] <skill> all this talk about packet captures how everything is in the packet captures but yet, they haven't shown/shared any
[22:09:40] <skill> and a hexdump on a screen isn't prove of anything
[22:09:53] <skill> but let's get the routers, they'll show us the truth
[22:10:02] <skill> if not the routers, i'm sure the cat5g cables will expose all the fraud
[22:10:07] <`St0ner> CNN got a bunch of actual experts to analyze all the hexdump screenshots he provided. they were all just crap metadata
[22:10:25] <`St0ner> lindell doesnt know shit from chocolate ice cream. stick to pillows my man
[22:10:36] <cmnky> so, in the current demonstration, they just showed how a dominion employee updated the software, which erased data from the election
[22:10:41] <cmnky> thats 'data'
[22:10:44] <cmnky> thats 'evidence'
[22:11:05] <skill> lol ok
[22:11:06] <cmnky> its just 1 piece of a puzzle which may not get completed, I'm not nostrodamus
[22:11:17] <`St0ner> if the machine is a backup of paper ballots, just count the paper ballots
[22:11:26] <`St0ner> and this has already been done in every contested jurisdiction
[22:11:28] <ajak> cmnky: that shows that a computer can compute
[22:11:30] <skill> funny how in 2020 the election was rigged but in 2016 it wasn't
[22:11:45] <skill> the paper ballots have been counted int he places where the 'fraud' occurred
[22:11:53] <cmnky> I don't know if Lindell has a "case" or not ... I'm skeptical too, but, still curious, still paying attention, and the math discussion yesterday morning was surprisingly good
[22:12:00] <skill> and the margin of error very low
[22:12:08] <skill> so you can show all these machines getting reconfigured
[22:12:16] <skill> the paper ballots already revealed there was no fraud
[22:12:19] <cmnky> skill, thats been addressed actually
[22:12:27] <skill> and the only fraud found were for trump
[22:12:42] <cmnky> skill, it wasnt 2016/2020 hard cut off, there was a period of 10-20-30 years or so where certain changes appeared in election results
[22:12:49] <cmnky> but see, this is what I'm calling "data"
[22:13:16] <skill> cmnky: right, but the person calling foul is also saying 'nothing to see here' when the 'fraud' helped him win
[22:13:20] <skill> so it's only fraud if you lose, i guess
[22:13:30] <cmnky> you're all up in the politics of it
[22:13:38] <cmnky> who cares
[22:13:46] <cmnky> we know what the politics of it are
[22:13:46] <ajak> you're all up on data but aren't sharing any :(
[22:13:48] <skill> i am, because it's a waste of time and money
[22:13:49] <`St0ner> entertaining moronic ideas and outrageous claims doesnt make you impartial or woke
[22:14:00] <skill> and people are losing their life savings over some moronic plot
[22:14:12] <cmnky> i shared the data ... rumble, rsbn channel, watch it live, watch the replays, thats the 'data'
[22:14:16] <`St0ner> a good CEO skill to have is being able to quickly identify what is bullshit and what isnt
[22:14:25] <skill> cmnky: i am watching the live stream
[22:14:31] <skill> just showing a machine getting reconfigured doesn't prove anything
[22:14:39] <cmnky> skill .. that was to ajak
[22:14:44] <[iz]> yeah, what stoner said is most relevant, i think
[22:14:54] <skill> exactly
[22:14:54] <cmnky> they've shown more than that since this started skill
[22:15:03] <skill> i've been watching. shown shit
[22:15:15] <skill> if you run a cyber sympossium
[22:15:19] <skill> share the data iwth those who are there
[22:15:22] <skill> let them play with it
[22:15:26] <cmnky> you can simplify it for irc chat purposes, but that amount of simplication is a mischaracterization of whats happened so far, they've brought more than just that
[22:15:31] <skill> not some random images and the 8chan guy lol
[22:15:38] <skill> you have Q presenting data. that says it all.
[22:15:45] <[iz]> well, i mean impartial doesn't mean entertaining outrageous claims
[22:15:59] <[iz]> the only reason you are even entertaining them is because you aren't impartial
[22:16:18] <`St0ner> a good CEO skill to have is reading and generating executive summaries. quick simplification and distillation of all the facts, and expressed in a few sentences
[22:16:21] <cmnky> I'm not particularly a fan of this "hackathon" format they are showing today

[22:21:35] <skill> but let's stick to the security topic, even if it's about election
[22:21:49] <skill> cmnky2: yeah, i guess we'll wait and see. I would've preferred if they had actually shared the data
[22:21:59] <rawplaye1> https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1425512521910325259
[22:22:02] <skill> if they believe a voting machine had a web server that was on the internet, show the packet captures
[22:22:51] <cmnky2> where the '37 terabytes' comes from is certainly an important detail
[22:23:02] <skill> yeah
[22:23:19] <cmnky2> and when Lindell himself is speaking, I just look at him as the host of the event, he is the fanboy, he's not the show however, its all these other people that are the show
[22:24:05] <skill> one thing is clear is that our voting infrastructure wasn't considered critical infrastructure until after the 2016 elections
[22:24:06] <`St0ner> in the cnn interview, lindell listed a bunch of polling stations with "hacked" voting machines. cnn went to those sites, and those machines arent even connected to the internet
[22:24:43] <mats1> why are you people even giving oxygen to this nonsense, in here
[22:24:49] <cmnky2> CNN is terribly deceptive, of course they werent connected for CNNs video, that doesn't mean they didn't connect temporarily during the election
[22:25:17] <`St0ner> they were literally dominion machines that store a digital backup of the paper ballots. and to verify the digital data, they hand-counted the paper ballots, which matched exactly
[22:25:40] *** Quits: atom32k (~atomekk@user/atom32k) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[22:25:50] <cmnky2> they were whatever CNN said they were, just like when CNN puts a reporter in a canoe in a drainage ditch and tells you they are in the middle of flood
[22:26:04] <cmnky2> or they put on steel helmets and stand on a balcony and pretend to be under missile attack in a war
[22:26:12] <`St0ner> at least some of those machines have zero internet connectivity. couldnt put them online if you wanted to
[22:26:18] <skill> let's just stick to the actual security topic. The tech of our voting infrastructure is pretty interesting
[22:26:30] <cmnky2> CNN produces propaganda for money under contract of foreign governments .. CNN is not information, its a business
[22:26:37] <skill> and yes, these machines aren't very secure. We've known that for years already, in fact, I played Doom on a voting machine last week.
[22:27:17] <`St0ner> estonia has been doing online voting for decades. how they doin it?
[22:27:32] <cmnky2> they made a point earlier about the ballots not being individiually identifiable
[22:27:56] <cmnky2> but as you say, we've known this, but noone cares, because it seems to be convenient if the people can't hold government accountable
[22:27:57] <ajak> hey man stay off the politics
[22:28:05] <ajak> we're trying to talk about security here
[22:28:07] <ajak> (thanks to you)
[22:28:37] <cmnky2> I'm not aware that I'm being political, if thats directed at me ajak
[22:28:49] <cmnky2> my comments on CNN are factual, and important in the context of security, as their news reports cannot be trusted
[22:28:52] <ajak> talking about the political credibility of CNN is political
[22:28:59] <skill> alright alright
[22:29:06] <cmnky2> and trust is a security topic
[22:29:15] <ajak> trust is political too!

[22:35:46] <`St0ner> i think your argument is bunk. you arent forced to work to pay taxes. bulk of the taxes most employed people pay is related to your income. the less you make, the less tax you pay, whether through direct income taxes or purchases after..
[22:36:07] <`St0ner> he could be impartial and keep his businesses of pillows and election fraud separate
[22:36:11] <cmnky2> you ever heard of "property taxes" ?
[22:36:14] <ajak> "the less tax you pay" not proportionally to income
[22:36:37] <cmnky2> if I own beachfront property, I can just eat fish, and desalinate some water, and sleep on the beach
[22:36:48] <cmnky2> except, for property taxes, which have to be paid in domestic fiat
[22:36:57] <cmnky2> because they don't take fish at the property tax office
[22:37:37] <cmnky2> its property taxes that "encourage" the productive use of land
[22:37:40] <ajak> this isn't security anymore
[22:37:46] <[iz]> it never was
[22:38:04] <`St0ner> how do fully electronic jurisdictions maintain their election security? estonia, for example
[22:38:58] <[iz]> well, they have a better relationship w/ cuba, of course
[22:39:00] <`St0ner> or maybe they're always being hacked and no one knows
