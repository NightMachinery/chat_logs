[02:21:20] <dimbulb> hello-- possibly a simple question, but it looks like opensmtpd-extras is in maintenance mode on the way to deprecation.   I was hoping to use opensmtpd in an place that would require tables from mariadb.   Is this still the preferred method?

[20:20:02] <aisha[m]> its not exactly deprecate but theres not going to be any more additions to it
[20:20:21] <aisha[m]> dimbulb: you should be fine for using it 
[20:27:52] <vxla> I'm having trouble using a src match in a filter and applying it to the filter list on the smtpd listener. I wanted to whitelist 2 networks to bypass rdns, rspamd, etc. checks but this doesn't seem to work.
[20:28:11] <vxla> I'm still hitting "550 no rDNS" when connecting from a home net (100.64.10.0/24)
[20:28:16] <vxla> my configs are here: https://pastebin.com/j21fVQft
[20:28:34] <vxla> are filters not "first match"?
[20:41:34] <satanist> vxla: the problem is the phase of the filter, rdns is checked on connect your bypass is to late
[20:46:04] *** Quits: seninha (~seninha@user/seninha) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[20:49:59] <vxla> satanist: if I move the filter statement for "home_net" to the top of the filter list I still hit "550 no rDNS"
[20:55:41] <satanist> no you need to change the filter home_net from "phase mail-from" to "phase connect"
[20:56:59] <vxla> ahh! that worked. thank you very much!
[20:58:04] <satanist> it's because in each phase the filter will be go through in each phase, so on connect it will check for each filter which is acctivated on connect in the given order
[20:58:35] <satanist> not shure bypass will bypass all following phases
[20:58:52] <vxla> yes that makes total sense and now I see that exact spot in the man page that I misread
