[15:17:42] <alter2000[m]> then again this thing https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter is one of the other plugins I read about almost every time I hop on r/nvim and AFAICT it's a language annotation tool that needs lang-specific parsers to work, but what exactly is it used for? I can tell that the language server has to know the language, but besides syntax highlighting I fail to find a use for treesitter

[17:13:33] <hab[m]> Hey, I installed `asm_lsp` with `nvim-lsp-installer` but `lspconfig` couldn't find the binary, so I added it to my path, which seemed to fix the lspconfig's complaint, however the client won't attach to buffers. I'm not sure what the problem is, and couldn't find anything relevant in the issues. Any ideas ? Thanks

[17:16:38] <clason[m]> if you use lsp-installer, you cannot use lspconfig directly
[17:17:07] <clason[m]> since lsp-installer wraps lspconfig under the hood, so you'll run into conflicts
[17:17:09] <hab[m]> I believe lsp-installer deals with lspconfig
[17:17:14] <clason[m]> "deals", yes
[17:19:13] <hab[m]> Yes, it's responsible for setting up the servers using lspconfig, but why shouldn't I mix both if I let lsp-installer do its thing?
[17:19:32] <hab[m]> I'm not manually setting up servers with lspconfig.
[17:20:11] <clason[m]> What are you doing with lspconfig then?
[17:20:39] <hab[m]> >lspconfig couldn't find the binary
[17:20:39] <hab[m]> When I said that, I got that from `:LspInfo`, which I believe is relevant to `lspconfig` and not `lsp-installer`

[17:21:19] <clason[m]> if you're not using lspconfig directly, what do you care about `:LspInfo`?
[17:21:56] <hab[m]> I'm not doing anything with lspconfig, I let lsp-installer deal with the actual setup, but the asm-lsp client do not attach to buffers
[17:22:17] <clason[m]> then that is an issue with lsp-installer, which you should bring up with them

[17:25:42] <clason[m]> because it looks like an issue with your config (project root detection)
[17:25:51] <clason[m]> and lsp-installer messes with those
[17:26:44] <ahmed-rezk-devAh> `adjust_column_width` is the latter spacing which doesn't make sense at all. I don't know why they call it `adjust_column_width`

[17:32:23] <hab[m]> I like being able to open a file in language I don't usually work with, :LspInstall the server and have it ready in 5 sec

[18:47:42] <clason[m]> Just install the plugin (and https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/playground for testing), make sure it's loaded, `:TSInstall perl`, then open a perl file and do `:TSEnableAll highlight`
[18:48:10] *** Quits: fub (uid190747@id-190747.ilkley.irccloud.com) (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
[18:48:37] <LeoNerd> Mmm.. the word "try" doesn't appear at all in  https://github.com/ganezdragon/tree-sitter-perl/blob/master/src/grammar.json  so this should be Fun
[18:48:50] <clason[m]> check if things look decent (note: you may need to adapt your color scheme to see all highlights as nvim-treesitter uses its own which may be linked to different groups than you are used to)
[18:49:07] <LeoNerd> Ahyes... I have several new groups I added ;)
[18:49:08] <clason[m]> you can add any literal pattern to a query
[18:49:41] <clason[m]> like so: https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/blob/7c6014df2e46d05685fe9a6bbc1d2e399e2b2414/queries/perl/highlights.scm#L75-L81
[18:49:54] <clason[m]> you could just add `try` to that list
[18:50:03] <LeoNerd> Well it still ought to fold and so on
[18:50:25] <LeoNerd> It should probably behave similar to if/else or somesuch
[18:50:31] <clason[m]> ah, that's currently not supported
[18:50:38] <LeoNerd> Hmmmmm
[18:50:42] <clason[m]> no folds or indents for perl
[18:50:46] <LeoNerd> Oh.. at all?
[18:50:54] <clason[m]> they're not that hard to add, but someone needs to Do The Work
[18:50:57] <clason[m]> yep, at all
[18:51:00] <LeoNerd> Hrmmmm
[18:51:12] <clason[m]> nobody contributed the relevant queries yet
[18:51:24] <LeoNerd> Most of my bugs are with the folding.. :/ vim-perl mostly highlights fine it's just the folding that gets upset
[18:51:26] <clason[m]> not many people use Perl these days ;)
[18:51:56] <LeoNerd> I had somehow imagined that if you get the syntax tree correct, then folding just comes for free by saying that certain constructions are foldable
[18:52:54] <clason[m]> yes, exactly
[18:53:04] <clason[m]> just nobody told it so far
[18:53:15] <LeoNerd> <clason[m]> not many people use Perl these days ;)  <== I suspect at least partly because of tooling issues like this. It's a sortof catch-22 situation
[18:53:30] <clason[m]> like so: https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/blob/master/queries/lua/folds.scm
[18:53:56] <clason[m]> possibly. I was not making any value judgement
[18:54:42] <clason[m]> But the Catch-22 goes both ways: without a language user who is driving these improvements out of personal need, they just won't happen.
[18:54:49] <LeoNerd> Ohsure

[19:41:53] <asn> did you have time to look into the libvterm 0.2 patch I sent?
[19:42:11] <asn> the one which reverts finding the last row for buffer resize?
[19:43:48] <LeoNerd> Isaw the patch. It was a code change with no context
[19:43:54] <asn> without the patch I get non-deterministic failures from the terminal tests
[19:44:01] <LeoNerd> I keep meaning to get around to writing a reply, along the lines of "please send a unit test. only."
[19:44:01] <asn> https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/17329
[19:44:46] <LeoNerd> On the same principle of "I don't like fixing other people's code" I also don't like other people fixing mine. Point out what is broken and I'll find a fix.
[19:44:58] <LeoNerd> But if you send a fix on its own with no context it's hard to judge what to do with it

[19:50:45] <asn> yep
[19:50:46] <asn> that's the one
[19:51:33] <LeoNerd> I can't immediately see what is term-based about this at all

[19:53:29] <maxyz> Amanda[m]: thanks, <nowait> was what I was looking for. It didn't work in my case for some reason, but at least I got the right docu now to figure it out.
[19:53:39] <asn> LeoNerd: The test actually starts at line 15
[19:54:26] <asn> so it calls that before_each() which probably sets up the terminal
[19:55:48] <LeoNerd> Hrm.. OK so it appears to be a few prints+resizes and expectations of outputs
[19:55:55] <asn> test/functional/terminal/helpers.lua has screen_setup()
[19:55:59] <LeoNerd> That looks like something very similar to libvterm's  t/63screen_resize.t  file

[20:05:16] <asn> LeoNerd: The issue was, that the buffer spec output it compared looked different on my machine, ubuntu in CI, macosx ...
[20:05:24] <asn> that's what I mean with non-deterministic
[20:05:47] <LeoNerd> Oh I seeeee. That's not what I had in mind; I was thinking e.g. some stray memory pointer of the kind that valgrind could easily find
[20:05:47] <asn> it seemed to be deterministic on my machine, but not when comparing two different ones
[20:05:51] <LeoNerd> Iseeee
[20:06:21] <LeoNerd> That -probably- means it has more to do with some command that is being invoked by the neovim .lua files thenm
[20:06:51] <LeoNerd> If you can reproduce it entirely within libvterm itself using its own .t files I can take a look, but until then it's probably best you continue to dig into what your lua is doing
[20:07:00] <asn> but with the partially revert, everything works again and the output is the same on all platforms
