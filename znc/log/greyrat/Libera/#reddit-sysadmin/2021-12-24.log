[21:10:34] <yuken> Don't like practicing it without results because results require years of effort, is how I'd put it.
[21:10:55] <sd> 13<mâ€‹istiry> right, in your mind "results" == expert-level art
[21:11:03] <sd> 13<mâ€‹istiry> e.g. "whip out a Picasso" like i said
[21:11:05] <yuken> nah, not that.
[21:11:15] <yuken> Just presentable to myself.
[21:11:50] <sd> 13<mâ€‹istiry> so now we're back to "you are your own worst critic"
[21:13:02] <yuken> ja. I think it's more that I have no ability to focus on something I don't want to do for more than 5 seconds.
[21:13:18] <sd> 13<mâ€‹istiry> so then focus on things you _do_ want to do
[21:13:37] <sd> 13<mâ€‹istiry> why would you spend time on things you dont like or enjoy doing?
[21:14:06] <yuken> Because art is fun, it's the whole "practicing" part that isn't! :P
[21:15:12] <sd> 13<mâ€‹istiry> there isnt some arbitrary line that you pass to become an artist. you constantly practice and improve it, forever, just like we do in IT and our skillsets there.
[21:15:28] <yuken> Difference there is, I got into tech when I was young enough to not give a shit
[21:15:33] <yuken> and now can't go back to the "not give a shit" mindset.
[21:15:37] <yuken> especially now that I don't have infinite free time.
[21:17:10] <sd> 13<mâ€‹istiry> you are viewing art as something you can only do if you spend enough time practicing it. like, you practice and eventually you hit the end. which isnt the case, it is something you continuously work on forever.
[21:17:31] <sd> 13<mâ€‹istiry> i think your issue is that you dont like it
[21:17:38] <sd> 13<mâ€‹istiry> so you'll never enjoy spending time on it
[21:17:50] <sd> 13<mâ€‹istiry> so instead, spend that energy in areas you do enjoy
[21:19:06] <yuken> eh.
[21:19:19] <yuken> I'll keep trying to practice until I figure out if I do actually enjoy it or not.
[21:19:27] <yuken> since "day two of practicing" means little.
[21:20:13] <sd> 13<mâ€‹istiry> day 2? lol so what, did you sit down one day, try to draw something, it didnt look like you wanted, so then you just gave up?
[21:20:50] <yuken> nah @mistiry, just generally practicing drawing lines and curves with my shoulder & elbow rather than wrist, and sketches.
[21:24:01] <sd> 13<mâ€‹istiry> well idk what else to tell you. figure out if you enjoy it i guess, because if you dont then i doubt you can force yourself to later. practice is something you will do forever - look at other things for examples. Pro Sports have to practice. IT you are constantly doing things in lab. Doctors do it. Musicians practice hard.
[21:27:47] <technonerd> WEEEEOOOOWEEEEEOOOWEEEOOOOOO
[21:27:55] <technonerd> aye dubya es

[21:43:12] <shakygator> not a good look
[21:45:19] <yuken> mistiry, grabbing a nice big sketchbook from a friend who hasn't used it since he prefers digital drawing, and going to try to do a sketch every single day, as well asf ollowing along with drawabox's lessons (methodical approach to drawing).
[21:45:27] <yuken> hopefully in 6-12 months I see noticeable improvements.
