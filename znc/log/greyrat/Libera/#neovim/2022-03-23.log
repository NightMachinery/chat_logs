[02:25:16] <clason[m]> ah, polyglot.
[02:26:18] <clason[m]> (to be fair, in this case the blame rests more with dracula, since a colorscheme should set colors and not mess with syntax files or tree-sitter queries.)
[02:26:22] <clason[m]> (but that's just me.)
[02:30:53] <clason[m]> and, to be clear: all these `after` scripts get run _once_ at startup and _not_ when calling `:colorscheme`. So a `:colorscheme` later will only do half the work, and it's not surprising that it will not have the same effect.

[02:41:18] <hwrd> any tips on what might be setting laststatus=2 after I set it to 3? I don't see myself setting it anywhere else in my config
[02:41:50] <clason[m]> `:verb set laststatus?`
[02:41:51] <seandewar[m]> `:verbose set laststatus?`
[02:41:57] <hwrd> ah thanks
[02:42:22] <hwrd> it just says, last set from lua
[02:42:33] <clason[m]> (those three extra letters cost you the win ;))
[02:42:46] <hwrd> lol
[02:43:07] <JackPordi[m]> Ah, ill try changing from vim/dracula to Moqiful's one then
[02:43:27] <clason[m]> just grep `laststatus` in your plugin folder then
[02:43:29] <seandewar[m]> if youre on head you might be able to find out with `nvim -V1`
[02:43:42] <hwrd> oh plugin folder?
[02:43:51] <clason[m]> oh, yeah, right, that got merged!
[02:43:54] *** Joins: rgrinberg (~textual@fixed-186-96-26-198.totalplay.net)
[02:44:11] <clason[m]> that'll trace into Lua 
[02:44:27] <hwrd> oh you're saying one of the plugins. I read that as config. my vad
[02:44:33] <hwrd> my bad*
[02:44:48] <clason[m]> well, I'm assuming that you know what's in your config ;)
[02:45:01] <clason[m]> so if it's not that, it must be a plugin
[02:46:08] <clason[m]> if I had to guess, I'd say lualine or a similar statusline plugin
[02:46:50] <hwrd> clason[m] you are right on the money, lualine
[02:47:10] <JackPordi[m]> Hmm so I tried Mofiqul's dracula instead, but it doesn't look anyhting like dracula :/
[02:47:38] <clason[m]> right, if you want global statusline with that, you have to set the option... wait for it... `globalstatus = true`
[02:47:43] <JackPordi[m]> Also tried removing polyglot entirely but that hasn't really done anything?
[02:48:28] <ii14[m]> are you using packer? maybe you forgot to recompile

[02:49:31] <JackPordi[m]> For some reason the colorscheme fixes itself after I run PackerSync inside the instance of vim (but then resets back once i leave and exit)
[02:49:46] <hwrd> clason[m] curious about requiring an extra plugin-specific option for that, but too lazy to figure it out at this moment lol
[02:50:11] <clason[m]> well, you just found out why, didn't you?
[02:50:26] <mjlbach[m]> many times plugins take over certain options
[02:50:35] <mjlbach[m]> because if they don't users complain they are "too complicated" to set up
[02:50:38] <hwrd> clason[m] no, I mean, why did they need to add `globalstatus` if they can just check `laststatus`
[02:51:19] <hwrd> oh, I see what you mean, to gather all the options in the plugin, rather than ask you to set up an option outside the scope of the plugin... that's what you're suggesting mjlbach[m] ?
[02:51:21] <clason[m]> because user might not set `laststatus`?
[02:51:28] <clason[m]> indeed.
[02:51:43] <hwrd> you can't make everyone happy I suppose
[02:51:44] <mjlbach[m]> yeah, like nvim-cmp used to take over completeopt
[02:51:50] <hwrd> there are downsides to both approaches.
[02:51:50] <clason[m]> I believe lualine (at least v1) predates Lua options
[02:52:01] <JackPordi[m]> Hmm so I should just try removing all my plugins and seeing which one causes the issue then?
[02:52:09] <clason[m]> if you make both sides a little unhappy, everybody wins!
[02:52:14] <hwrd> haha
[02:52:22] <mjlbach[m]> clason[m]: you win, which is all that matters

[18:32:44] <vext01> thanks folks
[18:33:12] <clason[m]> for what it's worth, that is pretty much the biggest gotcha in Lua, by far.
[18:33:19] <clason[m]> once you remember this, you're good.
[18:33:31] <vext01> i don't like that if you mis-spell a variable it pulls a nil out of its arse
[18:33:56] <clason[m]> (and it's only an issue on the interface to legacy vimscript which insist on using `1` and `0` instead of proper booleans)
[18:34:14] <vext01> yeah, i see why it happened
[18:34:22] <willcl_ark> Somehow my LSP stuff has stopped working on cpp files... whats the best way to approach debugging it? Currently from in the file it just says `too many errors emmited, stopping now`. The `compile_commands.json` looks correct (and generated with Bear as usual)... `lsp.log` does not seem to show these errors either?
[18:34:22] <clason[m]> on the other hand, that makes it very convenient to work with functions with variable numbers of arguments

[21:46:13] <clason[m]> so if someone was interested in resurrecting it, with a Neovim-focus (basically, more categories like plugin language), they could do so ;)

[21:47:57] <nova> that would be cool. I don't think my little linode vps could handle it though. would be cool to improve it in a few ways and add nvim "support"

[23:53:02] <EdmundsEchoEdmun> @atrius:matrix.org I suspect that you might be right.  So to be clear, the lsp provider is responsible for specifying the "go-to-implementation" methodology?  I ask because this seems just a bit off because the service seems easy-enough to provide generically? (e.g., given ctags was a generic solution).

[23:53:42] <mjlbach[m]> The way it works is we say, "give us the location of the definition for the symbol at this position in this file"
[23:53:42] <EdmundsEchoEdmun> * "go-to-implementation" methodology? (so neovim is not involved)  I ask
[23:53:45] <nova> but welcome to both irc and #neovim. If you have any questions about irc, you can message me. Probably /q nova My Question  will work and open a buffer to talk to me, but if not, use /privmsg nova My Question
[23:53:50] <mjlbach[m]> and then the language server sends us a URI, line, and column number
[23:53:52] <mjlbach[m]> and we go to there
[23:53:54] <nova> KinLux, ^^
[23:54:21] <mjlbach[m]> if the URI/Line/column number are wrong, we can't do anything about it, because we're sending a request to an external process
[23:54:37] <mjlbach[m]> neovim does no analysis of any of your code, it's all externalized to the language server
[23:57:37] <EdmundsEchoEdmun> @atrius:matrix.org Well said.  That's helpful.  It makes me think that using something like gutentags might be a way to provide a more robust approach "as needed".  
[23:57:52] <mjlbach[m]> Perhaps, I still use ctags sometimes
[23:58:00] <mjlbach[m]> less and less nowadays
[23:58:35] <mjlbach[m]> generally servers are getting better at returning the correct symbols, I think a lot of people are now realizing that LSP does not guarantee quality amongst server implementations
[23:59:35] <EdmundsEchoEdmun> Have you found a way to integrate into lsp using something like `null-ls`? or ... there is another interface that I'm forgetting right now
