[00:20:52] <dan_pena> I want to store a code : 00101, firstly I was thinking about an array of int [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]. But now I'm thinking about setting bites in an int. (I know that the max size is 32 bites so it's safe).

[00:25:17] <dan_pena> nomagno: my problem is like in this 00101 if I set that in an int, how to know that I need to stop after the 5 bit
[00:25:26] <dan_pena> you see what I mean?
[00:26:06] <nomagno> dan_pena: You want to use bitshifting
[00:26:17] <dan_pena> or I should store the int with the code and an int being the mask
[00:26:19] <dan_pena> no?
[00:27:09] <dan_pena> nomagno: yeah but I need to know that I need to stop bitshifting after the 5 bit and not continue until 32
[00:28:52] <zwr> don't set the value bit by bit just do it all at once
[00:28:53] <nomagno> int myvar = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){ myvar = myvar | (1 << i); }; printf("Decimal representation, should be 5: %i\n", myvar);

[00:29:20] <candide> nomagno: Decimal representation, should be 5: 31
[00:29:31] <nomagno> I clearly messed this up.
[00:29:46] <nomagno> Oh I set all bits
[00:29:50] <zwr> if you want a decimal representation of 5 just do `int myvar = 5;`
[00:29:59] <dan_pena> nomagno: no but here you are based on the fact that it's size 5. But for me it can goes from 1 to 32
[00:30:09] <zwr> that does create the bit pattern `00101` in the lower 5 bits
[00:30:15] <nomagno> 11111 -> 31, indeed
[00:30:28] <cousteau> dan_pena: easiest option is an array of integers (doesn't have to be int, it could be char / signed char / unsigned char / bool to save space)
[00:30:44] <nomagno> dan_pena: I'm not following
[00:31:01] <cousteau> there's also array of characters, like "00101" (...then again you probably want element [0] to be the rightmost one, not the leftmost)
[00:31:10] <nomagno> if you don't know the size of the binary number you're putting onto the thingy, you have a big issue
[00:31:27] <nomagno> In general.
[00:31:34] <cousteau> and then of course using bitwise operators on a uint32_t (or uint_least32_t, or an unsigned long)
[00:32:14] <nomagno> I feel really bad for making my software #error if uint8_t and uint16_t aren't defined, but I am relying on unsigned overflow
[00:32:18] <nomagno> So I can't do much else
[00:32:35] <nomagno> unsigned wrap-around behaviour*
[00:32:51] <cousteau> the size of a bool is usually 1 byte... right?  Can't tell for sure what's in Windows.  (I know it's not required as per the standard, but I *think* it's usually 1 byte.)

[00:34:33] <cousteau> dan_pena: disregard what I said about using `uint_least32_t`; I thought you meant the maximum was 32 bits, not the number 32 (i.e. 5 bits).  You can just use an unsigned int, or even a plain (signed) int (although I prefer unsigned integers for bitwise arith)
[00:34:37] <cousteau> or an unsigned char, even
[00:34:48] <sham1> 32 requires 6 bits

[01:00:20] <cousteau> sham1: depends on what you mean by "counting 32", if it's "counting up to 32 (included)" or "counting 32 possible values (so 0 to 31)"
[01:01:34] <cousteau> nomagno: but on second thought, I think they meant "they knew *ints* are 32 bits", not that the max size the variable they use in this specific program would be 32 (bits / value)
[01:02:51] <cousteau> btw, the minimum compliant size of an int is 16, not 32.  For example in Arduino it's 16.  And if we're talking bit operations, you probably don't want to use the sign bit, so that leaves 15 reliable bits.  15 is still much larger than 5 anyway.
[01:04:58] <nomagno> cousteau: I specify either uint8_t or uint16_t on my programs because of this. Well, mostly. I would do _least variants if I didn't consistenly find myself depending on wrap-around behaviour like, everywhere

[02:36:48] <cousteau> nomagno: yeah, I meant &0xFF as in `value_or_whatever & 0xFF`, not the unary operator & applied to 0xFF
[02:38:06] <cousteau> dan_pena: for small arrays, you might get slightly more efficient (and unnoticeably more memory-tolling, if at all) code if you just declare an array of the maximum size
[02:38:15] <rsjw> dan_pena: for local variables, take the sizeof of the variable, and maybe add a little for alignment. for more details, learn a little assembly. for dynamically allocated variables, take the size of the amount allocated and add a little for malloc's bookkeeping. for more details, research whatever malloc implementation your libc uses
[02:39:11] <cousteau> if you have tons of arrays like that, and they'll often use 10-ish % of their capacity rather than 50-80%, it may be a good idea to use malloc
[02:40:25] <cousteau> like, if your 256-element array is going to have 128 elements on average, you'd be allocating 2x as much memory as necessary, which isn't too bad
[02:41:11] <cousteau> but if you need to allocate 5 or 10 times more memory than necessary, and we're not talking a couple of KB but maybe several MB, your code might suck
[02:41:23] <rsjw> to know how large the stack can get, you'll need to know how things work on your system. maybe your stack size is fixed on your operating system. maybe the operating system will automatically allocate more until some size. who knows
[02:44:40] <cousteau> dan_pena: if you want a proper answer to your question, I suppose the only way to get it would be to implement both versions (malloc and automatic/static variable), run them, and time them with a large enough problem which is representative of what you think your program will face normally.  If you see a noticeable difference in execution time or memory use, then consider the alternative.
[02:45:39] <cousteau> ps: I think it's a bad idea to put big variables in the stack (as automatic variables); probably a better idea to make them static (declare them as `static`, or put them at file scope (outside a function))

[02:47:11] <cousteau> your program uses some 28 KB RAM, which is probably negligible on a desktop PC.  If this were on an embedded platform where all you have is 64KB of memory then I'd start worrying.
[02:47:42] <cousteau> but, on the other hand, using malloc might make your program, what, 1% slower?  If it doesn't get too slow it's not gonna matter anyway

[02:50:22] <cousteau> for example, maybe it just "feels right" to use malloc because it makes sense (as a way to say "I'm creating a variable and I don't know how big it needs to be until the program is executed").  So use that, because it's "the elegant thing to do", not because it's more or less efficient.

[02:51:16] <nomagno> I purposefully avoid malloc'ing anything in my library
[02:51:31] <cousteau> nomagno: I don't think you "free" variables that haven't been allocated... anyway no, static variables exist from the beginning to the end, and they're neither on the stack nor on the heap (in implementations that have those that I've heard of)
[02:52:08] <cousteau> nothing wrong with having your library call malloc and free, unless you're considering to target systems where those don't exist
[02:52:50] <cousteau> or don't work, or work very bad (e.g. the implementation only mallocs but free() does nothing; I've seen very simple implementations do that)
[02:54:00] <cousteau> s/very bad/very poorly/
[02:54:00] <nomagno> cousteau: Explicitly no libc dependency, so yeah
[02:54:05] <nomagno> Any memory I need has to be provided by the caller
[02:54:11] <cousteau> nomagno: ah then yes don't use malloc :)
[02:54:13] <nomagno> But I've found it a very clean architecture
[02:54:29] <cousteau> or, if really needed, make your own malloc
[02:54:31] <nomagno> It has grown on me after a while coding this way :P
[02:54:36] <nomagno> Less errors, less everything
[02:54:56] <nomagno> cousteau: Fully portable AND no depdencies
[02:55:01] <nomagno> Hard to do that :P
[02:55:13] <cousteau> oh well, if your library is just a bunch of functions and doesn't handle the "created objects" itself then yes, you can live without malloc'ing yourself
[02:55:49] <caze> What is wrong with libc dependency?
[02:56:41] <nomagno> caze: I don't know, I set the portability goals as a challenge for myself before starting the project
[02:56:47] <cousteau> I usually avoid having functions with unbalanced calls to malloc() and free() anyway, unless the function name clearly states that it's "creating"/"allocating" or "destroying"/"freeing" something.  But using `malloc()...free()` inside a function would be OK if needed.
[02:57:03] <caze> nomagno: Sounds like you set the portability goals before you learned the language.
[02:57:46] <cousteau> but for general functions, "let the user create the variable however they damn please and pass it as a pointer" seems like a solid strategy.  Doesn't need to be always allocated or always declared.
[02:57:53] <nomagno> caze: I definitely know how to work with manual memory allocation in C
[02:58:04] <caze> nomagno: That is not what I meant.
[02:58:22] <cousteau> it's how most library functions of this kind work and how I tend to write mine anyway.
[02:58:25] <caze> nomagno: The functions contained in the standard library are a part of the language.
[02:59:03] <caze> nomagno: So avoiding them is a bit like saying, "I'm going to void for loops, and only  use while loops."
[02:59:09] <tusko> you could use free()

[03:00:18] <cousteau> what I guess nomagno meant, is that it's better that your generate_prime_number_list() function doesn't return a list itself, but rather writes the list in a preexisting array
[03:00:49] <nomagno> Yes, it is actually cleaner than malloc'ing and freeing, in many respects
[03:00:50] <caze> It sounds like he's avoiding malloc even if it's for internal use.
[03:01:32] <nomagno> caze: I am avoiding a dependency on the hosted C standard library altogether, yes.
[03:01:56] <nomagno> I didn't set arbitrary requirements... Well they are arbitrary, but no dumb. I do make use of the freestanding libc
[03:02:09] <cousteau> instead of `int *generate_prime_number_list(int length) { int *result = malloc(length * sizeof *result); ...; return result; }` have something like `void generate_prime_number_list(int length, int *dst) { ... }` and do the malloc or declaration or whatever outside

[03:43:16] <cousteau> vectorized assembly is one possibility, specific platform-unique assembly instructions another, and also targeting platform characteristics such as optimal word size etc being hard-coded.  Probably not too dramatic, but well, feels better to use the stuff that comes with the tool

[11:14:46] <dave0> katsuragi: **root   lets you modify the tree, unlike *root
[11:15:28] <novns> katsuragi, because this function modifies the pointer, so they have to pass pointer to this pointer
[11:15:35] <dave0> katsuragi: if you wanted to use   *root   as a parameter, you would need a different way to modify the tree, for example returning the new root of the tree
[11:16:14] <dave0> katsuragi: did you write this? or is this someone's elses code that you are trying to learn?
[11:16:41] <katsuragi> It's not mine. I got it off Youtube
[11:17:09] <dave0> it's using a pointer to modify the tree

[22:18:49] <omegatron> to make it very simple: on 32-bit hardware you have an alignment of 4 (32 bits = 4 bytes) and on 64-bit hardware of 8 (64 bits = 8 bytes) - why even bother? because, for example, memory acceess at addresses which are a multiple of that alignment are faster than at other addresses ; and sometimes, it's the only way to access memory

[22:20:11] <jan_> i got it

[22:49:33] <ChoHag> If an object is 4 bytes and it doesn't begin at an address which is a multiple of 4, the CPU has to read two words and do a bunch of bit shifting or it throws an exception.
[22:49:50] <ChoHag> Aligning objects of 4 bytes to a 4-byte boundary eliminates the problem.

[22:50:35] <ChoHag> To do so you might allocate memory plus sufficient overhead, then increment the pointer received until it's an appropriate multiple.
[22:51:45] <ChoHag> CPUs (in general) can't read/write a single byte, they have to read multiples of whole words which surround that byte.

[22:53:48] <ChoHag> So aligning objects to word-or-larger boundaries can in some cases make code a lot more efficient, and in other cases stop it from crashing outright.
[22:53:55] <caze> jan_: When you need data stored somewhere in memory, you put the memory address out on the address bus. This might be 8, 16, or 32 wires running in parallel. You set a bit on each wire, and that represents the address you want.
[22:54:34] <caze> jan_: The more wires you have, the harder the routing problem the electrical engineer has to implement the circuit.
[22:55:40] <caze> jan_: But if you only have e.g., 8 wires, then that limits you to 2^8 bytes of memory, unless instead of having each address reference a single byte, you have each address represent a block of bytes.

[23:40:38] <Kerr> Could someone help me understand what this function wants: SDL_Vulkan_GetInstanceExtensions(SDL_Window *window, unsigned int *pCount, const char **pNames); in the third arg.

[23:42:37] <sham1> Alright, so
[23:43:29] <sham1> "If pNames is NULL, the the number of required Vulkan instance extensions is returned in pCount.
