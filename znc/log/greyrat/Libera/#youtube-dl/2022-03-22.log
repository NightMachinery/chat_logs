[14:43:28] <Molly_Lucy> Hi guys. newbie question: yt-dlp download a "webm" file by default. Can I choose another format, like mkv, without loosing any audio/video quality?
[14:45:20] *** Quits: toulene (~toulene@user/toulene) (Quit: Ping timeout (120 seconds))
[14:48:03] *** Joins: toulene (~toulene@user/toulene)
[14:51:08] <nimaje> you probably want  --merge-output-format  and/or  --remux-video
[14:52:05] <Molly_Lucy> so this way, I won't loose any quality between a .webm and a .mkv nimaje?
[14:56:10] <ede> if you don't recode there should be no loss.
[14:56:17] <Molly_Lucy> sorry to double-ask but I have to be sure, cause I'm about to rip/archive ~100 videos and quality is the main goal :)
[14:56:23] <Molly_Lucy> alright, thanks ede!
[14:57:14] <ede> depending on the source you may want to have a look at -F and see if the program's choice is ok for you.
[14:57:55] <ede> i think dlp has a different algorithm than dl, it's not always the one choice which one is best.
[14:58:36] <Molly_Lucy> hmmm interesting!
[14:58:44] <ede> i've also seen some .webm not having their size listed in -F and then dlp couldn't download it Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[14:59:16] <Molly_Lucy> alright, thank you again!

[15:07:57] <nimaje> well, yt-dlp's heuristic what is a better format is better than the original yt-dl's, but it is still just a heuristic, to really get the best you would need to download them all* and compare yourself, but you could get cases where you can't just declare one better as some stuff is better in one format and something else in another (*well, you can ignore some of them)
[15:10:52] <Molly_Lucy> I understand, so I download them all, then compare the birates with mediainfo? is there anything else to check to compare the quality?
[15:11:39] <ede> or just know what the particular site uses, some have really weird names for their formats, some don't even mention the resolution, it's necessary to yes, know them.
[15:12:35] <ede> Molly_Lucy, there's this known graph for audio codecs, mostly saying that usually opus is the better choice ;)
[15:12:38] <Molly_Lucy> website is youtube
[15:12:49] <Molly_Lucy> alright!
[15:13:19] <ede> i was suspecting it already. basically there's 1 webm and 2 mp4 formats, of which the newer one should be expected to be better.
[15:14:18] <ede> hls-480-1  mp4 560x320    | ~349.85MiB 836k m3u8_n | avc1.64001f 836k mp4a.40.2  0k
[15:14:18] <ede> http-480-0 mp4 560x320    | ~349.85MiB 836k http   | avc1.64001f 836k mp4a.40.2  0k
[15:14:28] <ede> dailymotion as just an example for oddity
[15:14:56] <Molly_Lucy> damn, I'm glad I asked in here before, will carefully check the different versions then! :)
[15:14:59] <ede> it's not really 480p, also http means here it's not pointing to a .m3u8 file, but to an actual video i think
[15:15:30] <ede> dash-fastly_skyfire-video-b8a24680                  mp4 640x480        | ~808.54MiB 1069k dash   | avc1.64001F 1069k mp4a.40.2    0k 48000Hz DASH video, mp4_dash
[15:15:30] <ede> http-480p                                           mp4 640x480     29 |                  https  | unknown           unknown
[15:15:30] <ede> hls-akfire_interconnect_quic_sep-640                mp4 640x480     29 | ~484.06MiB  640k m3u8_n | avc1.64001F  640k video only
[15:15:43] <ede> and this is video. as you see, no filesize for http-480p
[15:15:51] <ede> and the format names are just wtf???
[15:18:50] <ede> er, s/video/vimeo/
[15:19:13] <nimaje> you would need to visually compare them to really know which is better and comparing bitrates only (somewhat) work if the codec is the same, so same codec with higher bitrate is probably better quality, but you can't know for sure
[15:19:22] <ede> yt is at least pretty well organized here
[15:20:53] <ede> also, higher resolutions only make sense if they're native. when our TV was about to start with 1080p i compared some videos during the testruns, 720vs1080. it was just pumped up.
[15:21:08] <Molly_Lucy> thanks again guys, I'm good to go! :D
[15:22:31] <ede> oh, and some files may even have the ffmpeg command line in their header area, but only if it's not a list of .ts files stitched together with a .m3u8 of course.
[15:23:00] <ede> but i can't say on which platform(s) i noticed this.
