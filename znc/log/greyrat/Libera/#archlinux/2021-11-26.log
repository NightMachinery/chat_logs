[02:06:58] <SysGhost> I honestly though no game companies would roll with linux-compatible DRM's/Anticheats even if they exists. Game studios often see linux users as "a bunch of hackers who want to cheat and break protections"
[02:06:58] <tonitch> well
[02:07:00] <tonitch> usualy
[02:07:09] <th0rne> My experience has been that with new games experimental is the best, but with old games you might want to click them through.

[02:24:36] <SysGhost> many who do play under linux don't provide survey data at all, so the numbers are more misleading for linux than it is for Windows
[02:25:00] <th0rne> It's plausible, but are linux users really so anal?

[02:34:44] <onexused> SysGhost, I did.  It required me to update it online before I could play it.

[12:33:18] <wickedjargon> Question: I want to build Python from source. I know how to do this on a debian-based distro: `./configure` and `make`. Is it the same on Arch? Should I learn a different set of build tools?
[12:34:12] <sheep> wickedjargon: the build tools on arch are the same. The only difference is you install base-devel instead of build-essential.
[12:34:32] <sheep> wickedjargon: also arch doesn't split development files into separate -dev packages like debian does
[12:35:16] <wickedjargon> is there an article that goes over how to build from source on arch?
[12:35:31] <wickedjargon> Sounds pretty simple, but I am going to be doing this in front of a class, and don't want to embarrass myself
[12:35:33] <twistero> if you just want to build from source and install to say /usr/local
[12:35:39] <twistero> then there's no need for a different guide
[12:35:55] <wickedjargon> ok
[12:36:01] <sheep> how you build from source depends entirely on what you are building

[14:06:25] <J_Darnley> Then I don't knoww of a way to get it back.  The swp file will be removed on a clean exit.
[14:07:22] <J_Darnley> I don't suppose it is in the trash directory?  That would depend on how you deleted it.
[14:07:40] <morteza24> ok thanks
[14:07:40] <morteza24> i'll rewrite that code
[14:08:04] <mpan> morteza24: is that an ext4 file system?

[14:12:14] <mpan> morteza24: see community/ext4magic. If the file was on your root partition, DO NOT INSTALL THAT PACKAGE AND UNMOUNT THE PARTITION IMMEDIATELY, then install it on some other system and then use it from recover the file from the filesystem.
[14:12:43] <mpan> from the filesystem = from the fs on which the file is
[14:13:54] <morteza24> mpan thank you so much
[14:14:38] <mpan> If the file was on another filesystem, that unmount that filesystem ASAP, install ext4magic and see if it can undelete the file.
[14:14:58] <mpan> In either case the containing file system must be unmounted as soon as possible to avoid any writes that could overwrite the file.

[14:15:40] <mpan> But if the file can be relatively easy rewritten… I would do that. Otherwise it’s too much effort.

[17:25:10] *** tonitch_ is now known as tonitch
[17:25:28] <ianliu> my terminal, which is alacritty, is configured with "IBM Plex Mono", and when it doesn't find the glyph, I think fontconfig returns the DejaVu Sans Mono font. The command "fc-match --sort 'IBM Plex Mono' | head -n 3" shows Dejavu font as second

[17:28:02] <ianliu> alacritty only allows setting one font, there is no fallback setting. I'm assuming alacritty is using fontconfig to select the font

[17:46:43] <getynge> Hello world!  I'm trying to install arch, following the guide, and I'm unclear on a detail in the guide.  I plan to encrypt my installation without encrypting my boot partition, and am unclear as to where I mount my efi partition vs my boot partition or if it matters at all
[17:47:23] <getynge> reading the guide it looks like I can mount the efi partition anywhere, but I see some stuff online saying I should mount it in /efi, hence my confusion
[17:47:28] <SysGhost> getynge: it can be done in various ways. Personally I recommend combining boot and efi into the same partition. 
[17:47:34] <MacGyver> If you're not planning on encrypting /boot, then the path of least resistance is treating the EFI *as* /boot.
[17:47:41] <getynge> ah that makes sense
[17:47:45] <MacGyver> Just make sure it's big enough to hold the kernels and initramfs's.
[17:47:55] <MacGyver> For "only an arch install", 512MiB is plenty.
[17:48:17] <MacGyver> Uh, s/EFI/ESP/ of course.
[17:48:22] <SysGhost> it have enough space for a few alternative init images and kernels 
[17:48:28] <getynge> The other complication is that I'm trying to re-use the EFI partition windows created, but it isn't very big.  I remember I created two partitions on my home computer, but I'm away right now and can't for the life of me recall what I did to confiugre them
[17:48:48] <Tom^> MacGyver: until you start running stock,zen,xanmod,mainline,-git and initramfs and fallback for each one. :D
[17:48:52] <Tom^> MacGyver: im out of space :<
[17:49:12] <SysGhost> I would not recommend reusing windows ESP if one isn't going to dual boot. For dualboot... then it's preferred.
[17:49:16] <MacGyver> Tom^: I would say that no longer qualifies as "only an arch install" :P
[17:49:30] <Tom^> MacGyver: fine :(
[17:49:30] <MacGyver> Tom^: The "only" has an implicit "simple" in it I guess :P

[17:50:03] <Tom^> SysGhost: got to try it all before you know what you want to live with.
[17:50:04] <MacGyver> My Windows-created ESP is 256MiB and even that still holds up with linux and linux-lts on it with 21MiB to spare.
[17:50:37] <thrice> Tom^: do you though...
[17:50:42] <SysGhost> getynge: in that case you just mount Windiws ESP partition on /boot. it'll work just fine.
[17:50:46] <SysGhost> windows*
[17:51:05] <getynge> SysGhost: ok, thanks for clarifying this!
[17:51:18] <SysGhost> 256 MiB is on the short end, but doable.

[17:51:42] <MacGyver> You could consider creating a new ESP, also setting that one up for Windows, and nuking Windows' old one.
[17:51:54] <thrice> default has always worked, so I've never ventured beyond.  I tried -zen for a little while, before realizing any improvements were all in my head

[17:54:27] <SysGhost> in short: zen kernel sacrifices a wee bit of background performance in favour for user interface responsiveness.
[17:54:35] <MacGyver> SysGhost: I refuse to run a special kernel for that.
[17:54:43] <MacGyver> I just buy 14 hyperthreaded cores instead.
[17:54:45] <getynge> I have a friend that's installed arch so many times he doesn't have to look at the manual anymore even for non-trivial configurations, I wonder how long that takes

[18:23:37] <Khorne> The syncdb of the iso is older than what the mirrors have
[18:24:01] <Khorne> pacstrap just wraps pacman --root or what do I know..
[18:24:12] <guavahabanero> So just run pacman -Syu on the iso?
[18:24:23] <Khorne> I guess -Sy would be enough in this case

[18:32:30] <getynge> okay yup exactly what I thought would happen happened, no space left on device for grub
[18:32:46] <getynge> could I get away with creating a partition for /boot/grub and mounting that alongside the ESP partition?

[18:32:59] <SysGhost> eeeh... just toss that Toy OS out. ;)
[18:33:30] <MacGyver> Don't use grub.
[18:33:47] <MacGyver> systemd-boot is less complex and does everything you need in this particular scenario.

[18:33:57] <MacGyver> Alternatively, *do* use grub but then use a separate ESP and /boot.
[18:34:09] <jonascj> I am trying to recover as much as possible from a failing SSD drive. I can mount the partitions of the drive and copy most files without IO errors, but some files are unreadable when I mount the filesystems on the drive. Would it be a good idea to clone the drive with dd as opposed to mounting and copying files?
[18:34:15] *** Joins: solaraquarion (~solaraqua@pool-141-157-225-211.nycmny.fios.verizon.net)
[18:34:27] <MacGyver> So then ESP gets mounted to /esp or somesuch, and another partition on /boot, and then your kernels live on /boot and that should leave plenty of room for grub.
[18:34:39] <MacGyver> But honestly, whenever I have the option of not using grub I grab it.
[18:34:50] <Namarrgon> jonascj: if you really want to attempt to rescue the files then you should make an image with e.g. ddrescue
[18:34:52] <MacGyver> jonascj: Yes, but ddrescue
[18:34:52] <getynge> I’ll give systemd-boot a go I guess, the only reason I use grub is because I’m used to it but I’m always open to new things
[18:35:05] <SysGhost> just make sure there'e enough space for vm-linuz-linux and initramfs-linux, which need around 35-45 megabyte. Then double that so things have space for updates.

[18:38:14] <jonascj> Namarrgon and MacGyver : Cheers, I'll have a look at ddrescue.
[18:38:16] <MacGyver> Kernels update fine.
[18:38:29] <MacGyver> Pretty sure pacman operates destructively.
[18:38:31] <Khorne> SysGhost, throw out all the trash from your initrd
[18:38:47] <Namarrgon> lvm adds a lot of bloat to the initramfs
[18:39:03] <SysGhost> I can... but.. .cba... just defaults on this particular machine #SHRUGS#
[18:39:05] <MacGyver> Y'know, I *could* very well just not run fallback images.
[18:39:08] <MacGyver> I never use them.
[18:39:29] <Namarrgon> only for debugging the initramfs once every five years
[18:39:36] <getynge> I remember what I did at home now, I mounted windows ESP to /boot and a new partition to /boot/grub.  I’m assuming though that that’s not actually a good idea
[18:39:41] <Khorne> Yea, fallback image is chunky...and I don't have LVM on this particular machine
[18:39:55] <mingdao> 68M     /boot/   ... with EFI and grub directories there
[18:40:06] <jonascj> Namarrgon and MacGyver: Should it also be ddrescue if I just want to purchase myself more time with my drive (by making an image of it)? Time to copy files, time to reconstruct files if some are found to be damaged, etc. Or should it be plain old 'dd' to make an image perserving the current state of affairs?
[18:40:22] <SysGhost> either way. It's stupid to make it barely fit in the ESP now, and then down the road must need to resize it with everything else *in the way*

[18:40:58] <MacGyver> jonascj: ddrescue does exactly the same as dd.
[18:41:00] <SysGhost> Windows also need extra space as it updates
[18:41:01] <MacGyver> It makes an image.

[18:41:38] <MacGyver> Also, use a mapfile.
[18:41:55] <MacGyver> It's optional on the commandline, but you want it.
[18:42:33] <SysGhost> indeed. a mapfile makes life a lot easire with ddrescue. One can interrupt and resume as one see fit.
[18:42:38] <getynge> I’m trying to google but google is being unhelpful, is there a good way to move my windows partition “to the right” so that I have room to expand the ESP partition?  Or is this a case where I’ll have to nuke everything on my drive if that’s an option?
[18:42:48] <MacGyver> (Basically, the mapfile records where errors occur and how far it got if it's for any reason interrupted, so it knows where to try to pull data from when resuming a rescue)
[18:43:12] <Namarrgon> getynge: do you have free space at the end of the disk? or a swap partition somewhere in the middle?
[18:43:27] <Namarrgon> moving the start of a partition is always expensive
[18:43:35] <Namarrgon> unles it's small
[18:43:39] <SysGhost> getynge: you can just resize the ESP partition. it is after all jsut a FAT32 file system with some flags.
[18:43:44] <MacGyver> It's also expensive if it's small.
[18:43:46] <getynge> unfortunately all my free space is in the middle of the disk, the windows recovery is at the end and the ESP is at the start, I’m very much willing to wait for a partition move
[18:43:48] <Namarrgon> but fast!
[18:44:03] <Namarrgon> for some definition of "small"
[18:44:06] <SysGhost> getynge: in worse case you might bneed to boot-repair windows, which is easily done.
[18:44:20] <MacGyver> The complexity class is the same ;)
[18:44:22] <SysGhost> but after that windows sits just fine in the new roomy partition

[20:41:54] <Xogium> aka it's now entirely invisible shift, except for machinectl status… which I didn't think to check
[20:43:03] <Xogium> now granted maybe I should have thought of checking machinectl status, but

[23:36:44] <edgy> Namarrgon: yes, and I noticed it's strange that it contains "mount-point = /run/compressed-mount-point" at the last line whereas it's mounted as /run/compressed/mount/point, but I left that for later, my question was about what to use it for? I see zram0 is used for swap and zram1 is mounted on that directory but which app use it is a mystery
