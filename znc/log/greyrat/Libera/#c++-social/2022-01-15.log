[12:02:29] <Faux> Wow.
[12:03:09] <Faux> That nitter link looks more like we're all gonna die.
[12:07:53] <ERROH> we are
[12:08:47] <N`aZ> has somebody called will smith yet ?
[12:16:30] <Faux> I dunno, I think we're probably reasonably close to staving off meaningful death.
[12:16:44] <Faux> Y'know, within 100 years.
[12:17:00] <Renderwww> my death clock still is at around 50%, no time to die yet!
[12:17:46] <Faux> I'm assuming some breakthrough which keeps those of us who are already old and unhealthy, alive to 100.
[12:20:51] <Renderwww> good thing will be with the global warming and rising sea level there will be enough ocean for all the old and grumpy people to go on a cruise
[12:24:19] <Faux> Yeah.
[12:24:31] <Faux> Keep getting adverts for the family (i.e. with kids) cruise holidays.
[12:24:41] <Faux> My kid, being 1, probably won't appreciate it yet.
[12:27:28] <Renderwww> are cruises fun for kids? I thought it was an old peoples thing
[12:27:35] <ERROH> kids are fucking stupid 
[12:28:27] <Faux> The Royal Carrybean ships have like surfing machines, ziplines, water slides, boucy castles, etc.
[12:28:43] <Faux> They're fucking amazing tbh; like full on imaginary resort.
[12:29:37] <Faux> https://www.royalcaribbeanincentives.com/content/uploads/CMIC-Overview-Brochure-1.pdf haha, page 8. (not the best brochure)
[12:29:47] <ERROH> eu has announced that red meat causes cancer so today i'm making my fav stew without its main ingredient 
[12:30:05] <Faux> :(((
[12:30:37] <Faux> I've been buying the random vegan burger/sausage/bacon alternatives to see if any of them are any good; most of the burgers are passable (with enough olive oil).
[12:30:53] <ERROH> i gave up on substitutes
[12:31:07] <ERROH> when i'm in a veggie mode i just go for whatever 
[12:31:12] <Faux> I don't like tofu-chicken in chicken dishes, haven't tried any of the minces.
[12:31:23] <ERROH> tofu can suck a big one
[12:31:26] <ERROH> same with soy
[12:31:27] <Faux> The "this is like a burger but is actually a pea" don't disgust me as much for some reason.
[12:31:27] <Renderwww> next up error will eat the bugs, will live in a pod, own nothing and will be happy about it!
[12:31:47] <ERROH> funny story about bugs
[12:32:11] <Faux> https://i.redd.it/pdx4ruyftvr31.jpg
[12:32:12] <ERROH> couple years ago we accidently adopted a mouse (long story)
[12:32:31] <ERROH> now it has some skin problems, which are supposed to be caused by too much protein
[12:32:47] <Renderwww> are you guys akschually believing a nice steak is worse health wise than those highly processed weed patties?
[12:33:07] <ERROH> so each morning wife'u when feeding him she's looking for bugs in his food because he can't bugs because they have too much protein
[12:33:14] <N`aZ> Renderwww: ofc not
[12:33:37] <Faux> Renderwww: Technically? I think it probably is; there's more weird shit in there than the regulated food. Don't think it's relevant, though, no.
[12:34:14] <Renderwww> but how is he to bulk up without PROTEIN?! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUYP616SCqM
[12:34:44] <ERROH> he's apparently overweight too
[12:34:55] <ERROH> yes, we're driving a mouse to a vet
[12:35:01] <Faux> The fake burgers are literally primarily pea protein, which is the expensive end of the protein powder market for BULKING SHAKES.
[12:35:02] <ERROH> that's what couples without kids do
[12:35:36] <Faux> :D
[12:36:05] <Renderwww> uh, what else are you supposed to do with sick pets?
[12:36:07] <Faux> Sister's doggo had ear problems for years and she went to a new vet and they said "stop feeding him luxury food, just feed him the gravel from the supermarket" and they went away.
[12:37:10] <Faux> Our cat cost €100 four years ago, costs €300/yr in insurance, and when her kidney fails in six months the bill will probably be €2000 and won't be covered by insurance.
[12:37:38] <Faux> Obviously the wife will decide we're paying but it's hard to justify. (our cat is an asshole)
[12:38:15] <Renderwww> do you hook up the cat on a dialysis machine?
[12:39:05] <Faux> Christ no, that'd be like €10,000. €2,000 is for them to tell us we're fucked and for four tablets of paracetamol.
[12:45:19] <Renderwww> but it would be the right thing to do, thing of your poor fluffball and the GDP!
[12:45:36] <Faux> Yeah.
[12:55:45] <ERROH> i'm mostly laughting about it because back on the farm i'd be working hard to eradicate mouse
[13:06:59] <N`aZ> insurance for pets, wtf
[13:07:40] <Faux> Especially amusing here as we don't have health insurance for ourselves ('cos socialims).
