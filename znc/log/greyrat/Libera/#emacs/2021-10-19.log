[10:27:09] <codingquark> The tank to be monitored is 500L
[10:27:13] <twb> The ball thing floats.  When it floats high, it cuts off water flow

[10:27:55] <twb> codingquark: if you have a western-style toilet tank, lift the lid off, they use exactly the same design (but more compact)
[10:28:00] <yeti> the only Q about the hc04... how moisture resistant is it in the long run?
[10:28:19] <twb> codingquark: ah so you need the ballcock to be tied to an electric motor instead of just a valve

[11:58:26] <thblt> egli: afaik xref is built-in.  I doubt it's incompatible with your own version of Emacs. Either you're importing a more recent xref, or something weird is happening.

[11:58:40] <thblt> Ha, that's possible because xref is also on ELPA.
[11:59:28] <egli> aha, hm, that's a possibility
[12:00:01] <thblt> Yes, something may have updated xref (probably as a dependency) to a version that's incompatible with your Emacs.  If the docstring for cl-defstruct doen't mention :noinline, that's a bug in xref, which pretends to support emacs >= 26.1.
[12:00:30] <thblt> You can file a bug (M-x report-emacs-bug), but in all fairness I'd just update. 26.3 is ancient.

[14:46:55] <thblt> EdwardIII: The names car/cdr come from Lisp machines, I *think* they're from the names of CPU registers, but I'm not sure. 
[14:47:50] <thblt> Wikipedia says they stand for Contents of the [Adress|Decrement] Register
[14:48:18] <thblt> So not registers, but assembler mnemonics I guess.

[14:52:19] <EdwardIII> hardware-level GC would surely have come in handy down the line

[14:57:26] <jtgd> Apple boasted about how much greater the PowerPC was than the Pentium, and then dumped the PPC for Pentium.
[14:57:47] <EdwardIII> (i did do some research first, it looks like my tooling should be OK)
[14:57:58] <thblt> jtgd: one of the main issues was power consumption. They were never able to put a G5 in a laptop.

[14:58:54] <thblt> It's impressive, especially from Apple, how they ditched years of design errors and went back to an *older* design. The 2021 MBPs are actually bulkier and heavier than 2019 models.
[14:59:26] <EdwardIII> yes, and even the same ports as that generation

[15:07:13] <thblt> EdwardIII: but they'll need Microsoft.  Apple's strengh is the level of integration, the hardware, software and compiler teams are all in the same building under the same boss.
[15:07:17] <EdwardIII> well i should have the new laptop in around 2 weeks so if everything break i'll warn you all :)
[15:07:29] <pjb> Plazma: lol, and also, they could have made it less obvious, while spreading the reading keys widely.
[15:07:35] <EdwardIII> yes, true, you kind of need a dictatorship to enact that kind of change and have it actually work i think
[15:08:43] <thblt> This is interesting in a way, because this kind of major technical advance never really happened under Jobs.  They made devices, but their “revolutions” were on the UI/UX front, not internals.
[15:08:55] <pjb> Plazma: for example, the branches of the pine could encode a binary (or other code) text such as 
[15:09:03] <EdwardIII> hmm well osx came out of job's NeXTSTEP didn't it though?

[15:10:28] <thblt> This isn't meant to minimize the achivements of Jobs era, this is just a very different kind of change IMHO.
[15:10:45] <EdwardIII> yes true, more like a bold business move with a great payoff rather than technical genius i suppose
[15:11:46] <thblt> There's technical strength in all of that, just at very different levels.
[15:12:05] <EdwardIII> i remember bill gates saying something disparaging about it heh
[15:12:19] <pjb> thblt: it's a borrowed BSD SHELL. The core, is the kernel, is Mach, not BSD.
[15:12:46] <EdwardIII> but me (and i'm sure many like me) were attracted to using it in the first place because of the unix compatibility

[15:13:34] <thblt> Erm, and the UI…
[15:13:48] <pjb> thblt: Mach is a microkernel architecture, while the BSD kernels are monolithic kernels.
[15:13:53] <EdwardIII> hehe well we still see the NS namespace littered in different places don't we 
[15:13:54] <pjb> nothing in common.
[15:14:35] <pjb> Notably, as a microkernel, several different personalities can be implemented over Mach at the same time.  You could have a Windows-NT personality or some other system.
[15:14:47] <pjb> Exactly. NS.  
[15:15:06] <EdwardIII> windows subsystem for unix
[15:17:06] <pjb> Only for iOS, and only for the GUI frameworks, did they rename the prefix to UI.  The Foundation framework is still NS. (even if they re-implemented the lower layers in C in the CoreXyz frameworks.  So you an have CG or a bunch of other prefix nowadays.
[15:18:09] <pjb> It would be interesting to have an history of the evolution of the frameworks from NeXTSTEP to current Apple systems, since they've heavily rewritten and optimized the implementations without changing too much the API for a lot of them.

[18:48:16] <Sagaro> Does anyone here has encounter issues running some CLI program inside Emacs Shell because of locale?
[18:49:25] <Sagaro> I have the weirdest issue that hledger is crashing when some journal has non-ascii characters in them, despite being encoded in UTF-8 and my locale being en_US.UTF-8.
[18:49:44] <Sagaro> But on my terminal emulator works just fine.
[18:50:50] <euouae> how does it crash?
[18:50:57] <euouae> Which shell?
[18:51:22] <euouae> There's also #hledger, is it hledger that is crashing?
[18:51:26] <Sagaro> It returns "hGetContents: invalid argument (invalid byte sequence)".
[18:51:49] <Sagaro> I tried in M-x shell and in M-x eshell
[18:51:55] <Sagaro> Both gives the same error.
[18:52:18] <euouae> so it's a utf-8 encoded file?
[18:52:23] <Sagaro> I could try asking for help there, but this seems more of an emacs issue than an hledger issue, because running this on alacritty works fine.
[18:52:23] <EdwardIII> haha ok so just in case anyone else runs into the same issue, on erc, if you use hl-nicks, it breaks track/mention notifications 
[18:52:38] <Sagaro> Yes, it's an utf-8 encoded file.
[18:52:49] <thblt> Emacs plugins fighting each other? How original!
[18:52:59] <Sagaro> If I remove the non-ascii characters, it works.
[18:53:07] <acdw> EdwardIII that's good to know, i was having that issue before when using erc
[18:53:09] <acdw> didn't think of that
[18:53:33] <euouae> Sagaro are you running emacs as a daemon?
[18:53:39] <EdwardIII> on a deeper read i see there's a built-in highlight-nicknames lib, so might try that see if it  
[18:53:41] <EdwardIII> works better
[18:53:53] <Sagaro> Nope, just running emacs with an application launcher.
[18:53:55] <acdw> ooooh lemme know EdwardIII 
[18:54:05] <euouae> Sagaro try running emacs from the terminal emulator from which it works 
[18:54:32] <Sagaro> Yep, I tried that, and running "emacs -nw", the command works.
[18:54:38] <Sagaro> It only happens on the GUI version.

[18:55:54] <euouae> which shell are you using?
[18:56:08] <euouae> M-x shell, ok
[18:56:15] <Sagaro> Now, "eshell", because I don't know any better.
[18:56:18] <euouae> Sagaro what about ansi-term?
[18:56:32] <Sagaro> But actually my purpuse with this is to run this command inside an org babel block.
[18:56:50] <Sagaro> Which gives the same error, that's why I started trying inside M-x shell and eshell.
[18:56:56] <euouae> Does M-x ansi-term solve the issue you brought up though?
