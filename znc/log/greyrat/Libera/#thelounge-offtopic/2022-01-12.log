[00:00:21] <bookworm> the whole point of the chain is that it's the only source of truth
[00:00:57] <xnaas> I'd like to quote a song: Do your chain hang low? Do it wobble to an' fro?
[00:01:20] <bookworm> :)
[00:01:33] <xnaas> Anyway, the inherent shittiness of human being ruined crypto. I hope it all dies off forever. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[00:01:35] <c014> I think that the money printing fed and imf are doing are more concerning than bitcoin
[00:01:42] <xnaas> beings, plural, of course
[00:01:58] <xnaas> I just want to be able to buy PC parts again wtf
[00:02:01] <bookworm> anything with "smart contracts" is fun though, there's pretty funny defcon talks about mistakes people made
[00:02:04] <c014> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network
[00:02:54] <xnaas> speaking of domains, I know someone who was one step short of wasting their time in court with lego over an nsfw lego domain
[00:03:13] <Activ8> Donâ€™t forget miners purchased GPUs by the mass 
[00:03:17] <xnaas> money wasn't an issue, but they opted not to waste their time and just let lego take the domain down; which is fair
[00:03:30] <Activ8> causing gamers to have to hunt for gpuâ€™s because of the shortage
[00:03:42] <Activ8> which pushed up the prices for scalpers
[00:03:55] <Activ8> dirty nasty trickery 
[00:04:25] <xnaas> nasty hobbitses
[00:04:28] <xnaas> wait wrong franchise
[00:04:51] <Activ8> ðŸ˜‚
[00:05:11] <bookworm> yeah well, to be fair they have to file a dispute else they loose the trademark at least in some countries
[00:05:32] <Activ8> What time is it for you folks? 20:35 here in UK
[00:05:42] <Activ8> im watching a quiet place 2 movie in bed
[00:05:43] <bookworm> and I guess Lego targeting children really don't want a google result pointing to anything nsfw
[00:05:54] <c014> 21:35 here in sweden
[00:05:57] <xnaas> .t
