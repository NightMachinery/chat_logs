[00:07:40] <relipse> i thought PMing was considered rude on irc
[00:07:46] <relipse> because of all the spammers

[01:55:37] <varrg> anyhow, specifying absolute namespace: new \Config\Parser\JSONParser works, but removing the use Config\Config; statement makes new Config\Parser\JSONParser work. It seems like php puts me in a namespace when I use Config\Config; (__NAMESPACE__ is of course the empty string)

[02:17:43] <Blondie101010> it's one way
[02:17:59] <varrg> well, I rarely use external code but naming the root namespace to App seems like it could conflict with external code?
[02:18:10] <Blondie101010> using the fully qualified name would also work

[02:42:05] <BadAdviceCat> varrg, for what it's worth, rather than trying to alias namespaces (nothing wrong with this approach, but) - It's better to alias all classes that will be involved in that file. Why? Because then at a glance, you will know immediately what classes are being used in that file without having to read beyond all the aliases to dig into the actual source code to find which class is being used.
[02:43:14] <BadAdviceCat> Knowing which classes are used will be up-front, at the top of the file. Also, in a rare chance you will need to rename your namespaces, renaming them will be a lot easier, faster without involving the changes to the source code.

[02:44:39] <Blondie101010> that wasn't exactly the reason for their problem

[02:47:09] <varrg> Blondie101010, I actually didn't rename anything but sorted it by: use Config\{Config, Parser}; But yeah, I should come up with better names, but the class IS the application, and the namespace is there just to be able to declare other mostly helper classes and functions without collision risk

[02:48:21] <varrg> so I'm kind of in the middle of what to name it if I decide to not have the namespace and class the same. App is nice, but I'm worried about if you try to use this code in another code that already namespaces App. I guess the end user would just alias my namespace then though?
[02:50:09] <varrg> otherwise name the class App.. or something more appropriate

[02:55:40] <BadAdviceCat> varrg, o_O you should use a brand name for that namespace IMO. Something like: Varrg\<Name_Of_Produce_Users_Are_Using>\<whatever>
[02:56:08] <BadAdviceCat> Give the product a cool name. It can be bland too since it's under an author's name.

[15:01:12] <Jaami> omg, something is wrong
[15:04:42] <ramblebamble> relipse, what is the error-message and what version are you using. btw. might be more of a jetbrains issue
[15:08:04] <ramblebamble> Jaami, ever tried to put a die(var_export($data, true)); in your script during test or a dump($data) to see what is being received, a 4XX error generally describes a problem on the client-side, so the test might not be passing the entities expected.

[15:13:24] <Jaami> that sure is good idea, i did not know the commands. die and dump. please let me take few minutes to apply
[15:13:59] <ramblebamble> dump() is ususally reserved for twig or in PHPUnit
[15:14:19] <ramblebamble> die() is vanilla PHP and it terminates the running script
[15:20:45] <Jaami> null is shown in console for $data. $data = json_decode(file_get_contents("php://input"));
[15:20:45] <Jaami> 	die(var_export($data, true));	
[15:23:02] <ramblebamble> ah and is this on the client or server side?
[15:23:54] <Jaami> oh, sorry forgot. its on php code serer side.
[15:24:13] <ramblebamble> then the test never sends data
[15:24:14] <Jaami> hmm, doing it wrong?
[15:24:20] <Jaami> oh yes

[15:30:39] <ramblebamble> Jaami, what can also be the case is that you are posting the data instead of writing it directly to the endpoint, which would mean that php://input will not contain valid json
[15:30:56] <ramblebamble> in that case change your request or use $_POST

[23:42:20] <relipse> Do you all like my website? https://cworklog.com/showcase/
[23:45:48] <Blondie101010> no
[23:45:57] <relipse> what don't you like abou tit?
[23:50:08] <Blondie101010> the first is that you spammed it
[23:50:18] <relipse> whatever
[23:50:32] <Blondie101010> well you did, and this is off topic on top of that
[23:50:59] <relipse> can't talk about anything eh
[23:51:36] <Blondie101010> you can talk about php here, or something else elsewhere

[23:54:11] <relipse> Something is wrong with my PHPStorm, It own't update the indexes it just sits and never completes, I did File -> Invalidate Caches but nothing has worked, I tried restarting computer. I think it's having issues with the WSL 2 connection or something
[23:54:22] <varrg> that's not the logo for javascript
[23:54:36] <relipse> as far as I know varrg there is no js logo
[23:54:44] <relipse> so that was an old one
[23:54:51] <relipse> back in like 95 or something
[23:55:00] <varrg> when people thought javascript was java, yes
[23:55:59] <relipse> i use jquery so much I might as well juste use their logo
[23:57:06] <varrg> or the logo for macintosh, would be just as relevant
[23:57:30] <relipse> i don't code on a mac
[23:57:34] <relipse> i used to but not now
[23:57:45] <varrg> https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JavaScript-logo.png
[23:59:43] <relipse> ok updated!
[23:59:49] <relipse> better?
