[01:38:39] <ggreer> https://sci-hub.st/10.1016/j.triboint.2020.106651 looks like nothing so far can beat copper in its ability to brake. substitutes have much more vibration and lower coefficient of friction (meaning if you replace copper brake pads with copper-free ones, your minimum braking distance increases)

[01:44:44] <ggreer> Logos01: do modern cars come with semi-metallic pads? if so, that seems like some low hanging fruit
[01:45:08] <Logos01> ggreer: They're still a notable amount cheaper.

[02:30:27] <quanticle> Was it the secretary?
[02:30:29] <Logos01> And if you didn't know he was an arabic man you would assume he was just well-tanned.
[02:30:40] <quanticle> Oh, Asian
[02:30:43] <quanticle> Those don't count
[02:30:48] <galambo_> Jayson_Virissimo, I was stationed on the western border with libya when I was in the army
[02:30:54] <Logos01> quanticle: He's a Muslim, actually.
[02:31:04] <quanticle> Muslims... can be from Asia
[02:31:08] <Logos01> True.
[02:31:08] <quanticle> I know several who are
[02:31:32] <Logos01> But I'm making this distinction because I'm fairly confident he's not of pakistani descent but north african.
[02:31:41] <Logos01> I haven't asked to confirm that though.
[02:32:10] <quanticle> Oh. Okay, when you said "Arabic" I though you literally meant from the Arabian peninsula

[02:34:36] <Logos01> I just asked him where his family lived before they moved to the US.  But I *SEEM* to recall that his family moved to the US from Egypt.
[02:35:27] <filipepe> hi kuudes, olá Jayson, hi Loggers
[02:35:48] <quanticle> Oh, yeah, that's fair. The North African states count as "Arab", even though they're not part of hte Arabian Peninsula as such.

[02:43:39] <Logos01> A died-in-the-wool Mormon theocratic republican.
[02:43:42] <galambo> I dont think I fit in a demographic that is relevent to the culture wars. Im too white to be black, and too brown to be white.
[02:43:45] <quanticle> Huh, and it no longer seems to be up?
[02:44:01] <galambo> but not brown enought to be brown
[02:44:12] <quanticle> moreright.com goes to a domain registration landing page; moreright.org and moreright.net fail to resolve.

[02:44:46] <quanticle> Logos01: Is that the modern way of saying, "I don't belong to any of the established churches, but I'm 'spiritual'?"

[02:45:58] <quanticle> Eh, I wouldn't say they're ignored. I'd say they're mostly lumped in with whites, whether they want to be or not.
[02:46:13] <Logos01> quanticle: "Things white people do."
[02:46:17] <galambo> adiabatic, brits cant tell where Im from. quite a few people think Im french because of my accent. some people think Im romanian. others think Im south asian.
[02:46:18] <Betawolf> isn't there a thing about how all the affirmative action programs for schools are just ant-east asian racism?
[02:46:33] <adiabatic> Betawolf: yah
[02:46:34] <filipepe> galambo: pics
[02:47:06] <quanticle> Also, more recently, there has allegedly been a spate of anti-Asian hate crimes because of the coronavirus
[02:47:33] <adiabatic> my prior is that there's an uptick in what would be called polar-bear hunting if the victims were white
[02:47:34] <galambo> filipepe, I did actually post a pic of me here back in 2011 or 2012. I was standing infront of a tank and behind it a burning government building.
[02:47:44] <galambo> that was during the revolution
[02:47:45] <quanticle> You know, just how people shouted at me for being a "terr'rist" after 9/11, people are shouting at Koreans and such for "kung flu"
[02:47:47] <adiabatic> but since they're beating up asians too for shits and giggles, they're calling it hate crimes
[02:49:02] <galambo> one thing is true though. the problems black people face in the US are different from the UK. I think actually people of nigerian descent do better in school than white people. and nigerian people are overrepresented as doctors compared to the population
[02:49:16] <Jayson_Virissimo> I still credit Egyptians for teaching me that drinking extremely hot coffee outside in 100+ degree heat is totally fine, and even good.
[02:49:17] <galambo> but caribbeans are doing much worse
[02:49:47] <quanticle> galambo: Yeah, it's one of the markers of the extreme level of "soft power" that the US has
[02:49:49] <adiabatic> galambo: yeah, that's why Hannah Nikole-Jones refers to "ADOS" — our slave descendents do way worse than the average Igbo market-dominant minority
[02:49:54] <galambo> Jayson_Virissimo, you have to use a glass. mugs are cheating
[02:49:58] <quanticle> Everyone uses *our* terminology for race relations
[02:50:06] <quanticle> Whether it makes sense for their local situation or not
[02:50:09] <adiabatic> …even when they shouldn't

[02:50:17] <quanticle> You owe me a coke
[02:50:35] <adiabatic> when I'm in town, I'll buy you a coke, then
[02:50:53] <galambo> yes I feel bad for the poor african americans population here in the UK
[02:50:55] <quanticle> Hah, if you're ever in Minneapolis, ping me
[02:51:03] <quanticle> I'll come hang out with you
[02:51:10] <Logos01> galambo: ... "african americans in the UK"
[02:51:20] <adiabatic> galambo: what Logos01 said
[02:51:30] <Betawolf> I have seen people try to correct to that.
[02:51:35] <Logos01> There have been american journalists who caught serious flak both for and for *not* using black british people's preferred nomenclature.
[02:51:47] <Logos01> It's unwinnable.
[02:52:09] <Logos01> And if you try to call a black british person a british african they will get meaningfully offended at you.
[02:52:10] <filipepe> afro-british?
[02:52:14] <Logos01> Because british africans are white.
[02:52:30] <Betawolf> The idea that there are black people who aren't american seems difficult to parse for the Very Online. 
[02:52:31] <galambo> Logos01, so is it african british then?
[02:52:31] <quanticle> Oh yeah, like the white settlers in Zimbabwe and South Africa or whatnot
[02:52:38] <Logos01> galambo: No, it's black british.
[02:52:48] <Logos01> quanticle: Especially Kenya, but yes.
[02:53:12] <kuudes> why can't people just use their national group names or something
[02:53:13] <Betawolf> black british is what you tick on a form, but people just say black.
[02:53:19] <galambo> Logos01, tbh they just call themselves black
[02:53:27] <kuudes> british nigerian, nigerian british
[02:53:42] *** Quits: two2thehead (~AVX0@209.212.214.66) (Quit: Leaving)
[02:53:49] <adiabatic> kuudes: well, in the US, they don't always come from a particular country
[02:53:50] <Logos01> Betawolf: Exactly.
[02:54:29] <adiabatic> "my great-great-great grandaddy was captured and enslaved in a west african skirmish and was sold to white slave traders"
[02:54:32] <Logos01> kuudes: So the thing with that, in the US, is that "African American" became the nomenclature for the *culture* that has arisen from the descendants of african slaves.
[02:54:37] <quanticle> Or rather, thanks to intermixing among the slave population, the "actual country" they come from is now indeterminate
[02:54:37] <adiabatic> there's no ancestral nationality there
[02:54:55] <Logos01> Because they have no method of tying their culture or ancestry to any region of Africa.
[02:55:13] <quanticle> And that's leaving aside the fact that when the ancestors of American blacks were shipped to the United States, approximately none of the modern countries in the region even existed.
[02:55:25] <adiabatic> Well, to a point. They're basically all west africans (making the east-african-inspired holiday of Kwanzaa suspect)…
[02:55:32] <Logos01> quanticle: It's not just the intermixing, it's also the severe methods that were used to strip them of their original languages and cultural quirks.
[02:55:40] <adiabatic> but there's no lineage to clan or tribe or nation.
[02:55:50] <Logos01> quanticle: And there's also the intermixing of white Europeans into the overall population.
[02:55:55] <kuudes> also african americans are on average 20% white genetically
[02:56:05] <Logos01> Yup.
[02:56:08] <kuudes> specifically of paternal side
[02:56:29] <quanticle> adiabatic: Yeah, I was just saying that you can't say, "Oh he's an Guinean-American," when "Guinea" is a thing that didn't exist until a few hundred years after his ancestors were brought to the US.
[02:56:35] <Logos01> So anyhoo the point is that the interface of black americans and black brits does not work well.

[02:59:34] <kuudes> wasn't there a piece where anonymous person from 23andme confessed they mess up the ancestries slightly to piss off white nationalists?
[02:59:43] <quanticle> You know, I should take one of those tests and see just how Indian I truly am
[03:00:16] <quanticle> I wouldn't be surprised if there was a surprising large amount of "English" in my ancestry.
[03:00:16] <adiabatic> I got the thing from Dante Labs and they didn't tell me how white I am
[03:00:26] <adiabatic> but then again I don't really care about _that_…
[03:00:43] <adiabatic> tell me if my heart gonna asplode or something
[03:00:54] <quanticle> Yeah, as long as you know what your genetic predispositions are, does it really matter where they came from?
[03:01:04] <Betawolf> it's okay, you don't have to be bound by your genes, anyone can accept whiteness into their life
[03:01:12] <adiabatic> some people care about ancestry and I can kind of see why, but I don't

[03:01:20] <Robomot> FACT CHECK: Did DNA Testing Companies Admit to Altering Tests to 'Screw with Racists'? (A number of hyperpartisan web sites advanced a claim that DNA testing companies deliberately fabricated African ancestry to "screw with" racist customers.)
[03:01:20] <Jayson_Virissimo> It's pretty precise now. It even pinpoints the particular island my grandparents are from.
[03:01:56] <kuudes> Logos01, which way it was or must I clikc
[03:02:03] <feep> Logos01: "Rating: mostly false."
[03:02:05] <feep> "So it's true, then."

[03:02:15] * feep reads
[03:02:18] <kuudes> ah, so "An anonymous purported employee of an unnamed DNA testing company claimed that on two occasions, less than one percent African ancestry was added to testing results, typically when their findings totaled under 100 percent."
[03:02:29] <Betawolf> there was one anonymous claim of this on a humour site
[03:02:47] * feep headtilt
[03:02:51] <feep> "cracked.com piece"
[03:02:55] <feep> okay so it's actually totally false
[03:02:58] <feep> snopes, why do you do this
[03:03:11] <quanticle> Some people care, but I suspect it's the people who don't really know and/or are a mix of various ancestries. Like, for me... I'm Indian. My parents are Indian. My grandparents are Indian. I'm sure if I dig far enough back, I'll see some like... British, French, Portuguese, or Mughal or whatever. But that's less interesting than being a "mutt of Europe" as one of my friends describes himself.
[03:03:58] <adiabatic> I'd figure that'd be more interesting than 'euromutt'; with enough data they'd be able to pick out individual castes
[03:04:35] <quanticle> Wait, can they pick out caste? Now that would be interesting, but, at the same time, I haven't heard of any of the genetic ancestry companies doing that.
[03:04:44] <Logos01> kuudes, feep -- short form: there was a Cracked.com article where they interviewed an actual 23andMe employee and one of the topics that came up was questions about altering results to screw with white supremacists.
[03:04:55] <feep> Logos01: ostensible employee*
[03:05:11] <feep> does 23andme even do walk-ins
[03:05:15] <adiabatic> the only interesting question to me is whether my father was lying when he said where his grandfather was from, and I doubt a DNA test would be able to reveal that because of all the confounders on my mother's side of the family
[03:05:21] <Logos01> And apparently the anonymous worker claimed that there was one time that someone came into their offices and wanted proof that he "ain't no n...black person."
[03:05:34] <Logos01> So they appended "<1% West African".
[03:05:53] <adiabatic> quanticle: from what I remember hearing from Razib, there's more structure in South Asian populations (compared to europeans, and ESPECIALLY compared to chinese)…
[03:06:02] <Logos01> Which yeah. That's what you call some uncorroborated hearsay of questional provenance.
[03:06:26] <adiabatic> …meaning that caste barriers are very real barriers to sex, meaning one ought to be able to pick out caste if one has enough samples from south asians
[03:06:35] <quanticle> Yeah, I have no doubt that it can be done, but I wasn't aware of anyone actually doing it.
[03:06:44] <kuudes> feep, it is not specified what company

[03:09:20] <Logos01> I'm sure you could make a case with that.
[03:09:33] <adiabatic> I've seen mutt supremacy and from what I can tell, as long as you're not fucking anyone closer to you than a fourth cousin, you're fine
[03:09:45] <meowcat> yup. but if one is planning one's ideal generation-ship, spending much time on genetic composition is kinda creepy
[03:09:49] <adiabatic> and I'm muttier than most

[03:12:55] <saturn2> i'll always remember the first time i used wave. i stared at a white screen for about 5 minutes and then my browser crashed
[03:13:07] <quanticle> saturn2: Well, that's what you get for being a Firefox user
[03:13:09] <meowcat> quanticle: i have not, but am intrigued. the funky thing about wave was having both thread-mode and OT-wiki-docs-mode in the same client. the last system that really grokked threads was probably MT-NewsWatcher.
[03:13:13] <Betawolf> saturn2: welcome to the future

[03:17:05] <meowcat> if you are ever designing a messaging system, remember: there is only one kind of message. there is not "posts" for starting threads and "comments" subsidiary to them. all messages need absolutely-referrable-to message-ids / urls, so that someone can point to a message and say "this one". also i have more rants on other stuff.
[03:18:04] <saturn2> quanticle: i see. chrome had been released for windows but hadn't been ported to linux yet
[03:18:13] <saturn2> i guess that's why
[03:20:04] <quanticle> Well, that's what you get for being a Linux... actually no, I won't make that joke. That joke is old and it's been done by Broadcom and every winprinter and winmodem manufacturer.
[03:21:24] <meowcat> these days, privileged people only run linux on hardware that was built to run it. like a system76 desktop, a raspberry pi, or a google datacenter.

[03:22:19] <Logos01> quanticle: So I had to upgrade my laptop's install of awscli from 1.x.x to 2.x.x, to take advantage of the AWS SSO stuff.
[03:22:30] <quanticle> Oof
[03:22:44] <Logos01> So I tried to do this the "correct" way; I'd used pip3 to install awscli, so I figured I should use pip3 to do the awscli upgrade.
[03:22:51] <Logos01> Figured out the change in package name, easy enough.
[03:22:52] <RiversHaveWings> ...*114* degrees?
[03:22:55] <RiversHaveWings> On Sunday?
[03:22:57] <quanticle> pip3 install --upgrade awscli?
[03:23:07] <Logos01> `pip3 uninstall awscli ; pip3 install awscliv2`
[03:23:25] <quanticle> Oh, they changed the package name; sorry I missed that detail.
[03:23:35] <Logos01> Which is like ... I *guess* 1.x.x is still maintained so it kind of makes sense to to do this.
[03:23:40] <Logos01> Here's the part where I start kvetching.
[03:23:51] <Logos01> awscli is still written in python. Even in the v2.
[03:23:56] <Logos01> But.
[03:24:07] <Logos01> Did `pip3 install awscliv2` install python modules?
[03:24:08] <Logos01> No.
[03:24:14] <Logos01> It. Installed. A. Fucking. Docker. Container.
[03:24:21] <meowcat> i forget, how much awscli do you need before you can just use boto in python?

[03:39:49] <Jayson_Virissimo> All he was going to do was spend his days "fishing and drinking", but USG just wouldn't let him have even that.
[03:40:42] <gwern> (mcafee actually said 'phishing', but it's an easy mistake)
[03:41:32] <meowcat> Dude certainly played up the image of the dirty expat occasionally.
[03:43:04] <saturn2> why can't USG just leave innocent murderers alone??
[03:43:16] <shawwwn> McAfee’s… yeah, what saturn2 said
[03:43:35] <shawwwn> But was he a murderer?
[03:44:01] <shawwwn> My impression was, weird, yes. Probably business weird, yes. Murdering people weird, no
[03:44:15] <shawwwn> I haven’t looked into it at all
[03:44:22] <Jayson_Virissimo> Let's not argue about "who killed who".
[03:44:24] <shawwwn> But I assumed that he was being extradited for business schenanigans
[03:44:45] <shawwwn> Well, it’s more like, did mcafee kill anyone at all? Or had them killed, whatever.
[03:44:56] <meowcat> i thought "business weird" meant "the CEO goes to one of the dodgier camps at burning man"
[03:45:29] <shawwwn> Eh, probably closer to “Enron / Bernie madoff” type crime
[03:45:39] <meowcat> ohhh, business felon weird.
[03:45:42] <shawwwn> But Enron and madoff didn’t have anyone killed :)
[03:45:47] <shawwwn> Yis.
[03:45:54] <saturn2> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_mcafee#Death_of_Gregory_Faull
[03:45:55] <Robomot> John McAfee - Wikipedia [Death of Gregory Faull] (John David McAfee (/ˈmækəfiː/ MAK-ə-fee;[3][4] 18 September 1945 – 23 June 2021)[5][6] was a British-American computer programmer, businessman, and two-time presidential candidate who unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party nomination for president of the United States in 2016 and 2020. …)
[03:45:59] <shawwwn> “There exists a reason for the US to seek extradition of mcafee”
[03:46:06] <shawwwn> Ah.
[03:46:10] * shawwwn reads
[03:47:02] <saturn2> i looked into it a bit at the time, it seemed like he most likely killed the guy
[03:47:40] <Jayson_Virissimo> "McAfee later said he faked the heart attacks to buy time for his attorney to file a series of appeals that ultimately prevented his deportation to Belize"
[03:47:48] <Jayson_Virissimo> Hmmm....
[03:48:23] <meowcat> i am comfortable with a certain amount of lawbreaking but i would prefer to keep my life entirely away from having to have attorneys prevent my deportation to anywhere.
[03:49:39] <shawwwn> Mm. Seems the truth is halfway between my thinking and saturn2’s example. “On 5 October 2020, McAfee was arrested in Spain at the request of the United States Department of Justice for tax evasion. The June indictment, which was unsealed upon his arrest, alleged he earned millions of dollars from 2014 to 2018, and failed to file income tax returns.”
[03:49:57] <shawwwn> So it was money/business related (the extradition)
[03:50:04] <shawwwn> But I didn’t know about the hit.
[03:50:21] * shawwwn reassesses feelings about mcafee
[03:51:38] <meowcat> failed to file returns ... until COVID i woulda said "how do you get so far gefucked that you can't call your accountant/tax-preparer/etc. and get them the stuff to make vaguely approximate noises at the IRS" but um actually paperwork is dumb.
[03:52:48] <Jayson_Virissimo> I filed 2 weeks before the deadline and they still haven't send my stimulus check yet.
[03:52:51] <meowcat> "ok, i cannot tell what to file without committing a felony one way or another" is actually a completely feasible state for a zillionaire with no political influence to have.
[03:53:10] <Jayson_Virissimo> BRB, having the IRS extradited...
[03:53:54] <gwern> fortunately, being a zillionaire, you can afford a taxlawyer
[03:54:18] <gwern> RiversHaveWings: I think you greatly overestimate everyone's knowledge of the appearance of datura
[03:54:49] <meowcat> which is why zillionaire should occasionally get off the datura and call the taxlawyer so they don't fail to file any returns, yes.
[03:55:54] <shawwwn> Eh. Mcafee said the extradition was politically motivated. If that was true, I think “failed to file a tax return” is a plausible accusation to be … “invented” against him
[03:56:24] <shawwwn> Because it’s one of those things where, yes it may have happened, but also it’s not the type of thing that would usually lead to a rich person spending the rest of his life in prison
[03:56:39] <shawwwn> Not unless someone with influence really didn’t like you.
[03:57:10] <shawwwn> But, yes! Technically, he shouldn’t have failed to make the irs happy. I just think he probably did have a tax lawyer
[03:57:25] <gwern> you either did or didn't file a tax return, it's kinda hard to make that up
[03:57:43] <meowcat> occasionally people even tweet theirs. 's weird.
[03:57:49] <shawwwn> The indictment’s job is to indict.
[03:58:02] <shawwwn> You’re treating it as if it was already a conclusion that he did it
[03:58:21] <Jayson_Virissimo> Certain 3 letter agencies are above tampering with tax records though, but in this case I don't think they did.
[03:58:28] <Jayson_Virissimo> aren't*

Later in the film, another character views the screen to see an approaching person, whom he confronts in the tunnel. The ransom demand in the remake

[04:25:40] <shawwwn> there's actually a specific process
[04:25:51] <shawwwn> it took many years to figure it out. But it goes something like this
[04:26:33] <shawwwn> your youtube recommendations are almost always "stuff you usually like." Not that you'd like everything you see, but just that it falls within your usual taste range. E.g. I might not like a certain video about ML, but seeing an ML-related video pop up is unsurprising
[04:26:44] <shawwwn> however, occasionally, you'll see something pop up that makes you go "the heck? why?"
[04:26:53] <shawwwn> you need to force yourself to watch that video
[04:27:25] <shawwwn> more often than not, it's something that overlaps between your current taste range and something else -- something interesting
[04:28:07] <shawwwn> if you end up liking it, the keys to seeing more of it are (a) watch the video to completion, (b) subscribe, and (c) thumbs up the video. Then go back to your homepage, repeat.
[04:28:26] <shawwwn> surprisingly, the act of subscribing, doesn't cause your normal stuff to get drowned out

[05:19:13] <galambo> whoa I have 3000 subscriptions

[05:20:39] <galambo> they were actually 4000 but I am trimming them off. I downloaded a bunch of random opml files from the internet
[05:22:00] <galambo> I dont know why I keep doing that

[05:24:09] <Mark_> 4000 is way too much; guaranteed to be tons of broken feeds, feeds with no regular posting, feeds that will not have ids or not use them correctly and cause duplicate posts to appear, feeds with wrong timestamps that will always show up in the wrong places, etc.
[05:26:20] <galambo> Mark_, yes. Im trimming them off now. a bit tedious tbh
[05:26:32] <gwern> https://twitter.com/afan_foryou/status/1408505339557859340/photo/1 that suit is quite the statement. the lack of a fancy dress is also a statement

[05:28:05] <Mark_> there’s always the strategy of submitting everything to https://validator.w3.org/feed/ (they don’t do rate limiting, as far as I’ve been able to tell) and removing everything that doesn’t stick. at least guarantees your feed reader will get usable ids and timestamps (except for the old rss version that doesn’t require ids, but you can automate checking that too with feedparser)

[05:28:40] <filipepe> gwern: what does it mean?
[05:28:52] <gwern> I'm not sure, but I expect their marriage will not be boring
[05:29:01] <galambo> Mark_, inoreader verifies the feeds
[05:29:46] <Mark_> ah. some feed readers will tolerate bad feeds and handle them in ways that make the user experience worse instead.
[05:31:37] <gwern> (goddamn it. still some broken links after all)
[05:32:08] <galambo> Mark_, fwiw my experience with inoreader has been pretty good
[05:32:22] <galambo> it flags up the invalid feeds
[05:32:46] <galambo> also it performs well with 4000 feeds
[05:33:17] <galambo> it also updates them all every 60 minutes at the most because of my pro subscription
[05:33:21] <gwern> (another 2 header errors, well, I'll change thos rewrites...)
[05:34:25] <Mark_> that is pretty good... I’d be a little worried about checking 4000 feeds every 60 minutes...
[05:35:41] <galambo> Mark_, Im getting my money's worth
[05:37:15] <gwern> I'm sure it's amortized across more than 1 user
[05:37:43] <gwern> that's why google reader was so fast. if it was a public feed, there was almost certainly another GR user, and they could ping it fast and amortize across all the readers
[05:38:11] <Mark_> when they do amortization, there’s probably still duplication between rss and atom feeds, between users using https and not using https, different urls...
[05:38:15] <gwern> (or such was my assumption, anyway, it'd be illogical to architect it otherwise)
[05:39:00] <Mark_> however in many cases they can just subscribe to the feeds and have the server ping them. that has been a feature for a while now.
[05:40:30] <Mark_> at the very least newsblur and feedly will do this, and it’s supported by at least wordpress, medium, blogger, feedburner
[05:40:58] <Mark_> so, much better than amortization
[05:42:31] <Mark_> github’s blog has https://github.blog/all.atom, https://github.blog/feed/, https://github.blog/feed, https://github.blog/feed/atom, https://github.blog/feed/atom/, as well as each of these URLs without https

[07:43:38] <gwern> (in terms of shocks, corona is a pretty good one. destructive of relatively little physical capital, lots of time to think, ability to research stuff remotely)
[07:43:48] <Logos01> adiabatic: In looking this up just now I also discovered something that is apparently becoming more of a trend called "tip pooling"
[07:43:58] <Logos01> Which is ... disincentivizing just based on the name of it.
[07:44:17] <adiabatic> are you pro-tip, anti-tip, or it's complicated?
[07:44:17] <PlanckWalk> I've always thought of tips as essentially "corruption lite"
[07:44:51] <gwern> I'm anti-tip. I don't think they typically do credit assignment accurately in restaurants, even, never mind anything more complicated
[07:44:52] <nshepperd> isn't tip pooling just... wages?
[07:45:07] <PlanckWalk> Expecting personal extras on top of the advertised price just for doing their job adequately.
[07:45:42] <adiabatic> I hear service usually sucks in no-tip cultures
[07:45:52] <PlanckWalk> (On top of the credit assignment problems, yes)
[07:47:18] <mst> adiabatic: rubbish
[07:48:19] <mst> adiabatic: or at least, "I'm not going to believe this without data"
[07:48:25] <nshepperd> i don't think service was any better in America than it is here
[07:48:34] <Logos01> nshepperd: Kind of, except when it's business-controlled tip-pooling it's just fucked up is what it is.
[07:49:01] <Logos01> Because it's basically reducing waiter tip income to reduce cook base salary on the basis of cooks participating in the pool.
[07:49:14] <Logos01> So literally everybody loses except owners.
[07:49:35] <gwern> I haven't noticed service in america being world-class in general. and service is often better in places like fast food restaurants
[07:49:37] <nshepperd> actually it was more annoying, because the waiters kept bothering us hoping that their "friendliness" or whatever would get them more tips
[07:49:40] <Obormot\Gaia> mst: I've found that service sucks more in not-America than America (and more in not-NYC than NYC, for that matter)
[07:49:42] <PlanckWalk> The only countries I've been to were low- or no-tip culture so I don't have much to compare against, but service has very rarely been poor in my experience.
[07:49:56] <Obormot\Gaia> mst: To what extent tip/no-tip is causal, I couldn't say
[07:50:32] <Logos01> It's hard to make statements about how tipping/no-tipping affects quality of service because you have to be well-calibrated to understanding the innate cultural differences and expectations between countries to get that assessment correct.
[07:50:32] * gwern still sometimes thinks about how in _Legend of the Galactic Heroes_, the secondary protagonist, thousands of years in the future, traveling halfway across the galaxy to Earth, reviews history lessons on a slide projector, and wonders how it is possible to be that bad at SF
[07:51:05] <Logos01> Like in Japan, which is a no-tip country, it's also *expected* that you will call to your waiter if you want their attention. Up to and including calling for a specific item, and quite loudly.
[07:51:34] <Logos01> And wait-staff will just never check on you unless you call them -- because to intrude on you would be rude.
[07:52:21] <Logos01> But at the same time there is apparently a (minor?) trend in some restaurants there that if you go to a restaurant alone they'll seat a giant plush animal in the seat opposite you so you won't feel lonely -- might just be one niche restaurant that does that though.
[07:52:21] <gwern> https://twitter.com/hardmaru/status/1408622379555721221/photo/1 I'll admit, aside from lecun, ng, and hassabis, I can't recognize any of these

[07:52:35] <gwern> Logos01: I thought that was a corona-only distancing thing?

[07:54:22] <gwern> ah. I could swear I read about corona-specific trends about that

[07:55:53] <gwern> yes, I may have seen that one specifically... assuming I don't just see capybaras everywhere thanks to dall-e
[07:56:11] <adiabatic> I could use a stuffed animal sometimes. if I get up to go pee midway sometimes they think I've dined and dashed

[20:43:36] <shawwwn> Yes, but leaving a job is a mutually beneficial decision.
[20:43:37] <two2thehead> what gwern said
[20:44:06] <shawwwn> The reason to get a gf is because it’s mutually beneficial
[20:44:22] <shawwwn> It’s not a thing that’s like, a constant effort that you need to go “get and keep”
[20:44:43] <gwern> I think relationships do require effort to maintain?
[20:44:52] <shawwwn> Because mutual benefit
[20:45:18] <gwern> and if she (or you) doesn't see the mutual benefit, that relationship may not stick around very long, yes
[20:45:57] <shawwwn> If you’re not getting what you want out of it, then end the relationship. But I think lots of people (guys especially) see it as a thing they need to “go get”
[20:46:26] <shawwwn> It won’t happen if you don’t put in minimum effort, sure. But it’s also not like, a big huge effort

(2) The Age of Em - <1%, since we cannot obtain functional models even of 40 year old microchips from scanning them, to say nothing of biological organisms (Jonas & Kording, 2016)  (3) (a) Biosingularity to Technosingularity - 50%, since the genomics revolution 
[21:42:55] <dbohdan> is just getting started and governments are unlikely to either want to, let alone be successful at, rigorously suppressing it. And if AGI is harder than the optimists say, and will take considerably longer than mid-century to develop, then it's a safe bet that IQ-augmented humans will come to play a critical role in eventually developing it. I would put the probability peak for a technosingularity from a biosingularity at around 2100.  (3) (b) Direct 
[21:42:56] <dbohdan> Biosingularity - 5%, if we decide that proceeding with AGI is too risky, or that consciousness both has cardinal inherent value and is only possible with a biological substrate.  (4) Eschaton - 10%, of which: (a) Philosophical existential risks - 5%; (b) Malevolent AGI - 1%; (c) Other existential risks, primarily technological ones: 4%.  (5) The Age of Malthusian Industrialism - 10%, with about even odds on whether we manage to launch the

[22:48:14] <nshepperd> you just have to invert a system of linear equations in your head, to derive where to drag so that the zoom box ends where you want it by the end of the drag

[22:49:30] <two2theheadPC0> "Just as humans have their own individual personalities, new research in the Journal of Comparative Psychology shows that elephants have personalities, too. Moreover, an elephant’s personality may play an important role in how well that elephant can solve novel problems."
[22:50:42] <two2theheadPC0> "“We took a comprehensive approach by using three different problem-solving tasks and three types of personality assessments to determine if individual personality played a role in which elephants were able to solve these tasks,” Barrett says. “Since we couldn’t give the elephants a personality test like the ones you’re familiar with online, we had to think creatively.”
[22:50:42] <two2theheadPC0> The authors developed novel object tests, in which they presented the elephants with an unfamiliar object, a mylar balloon, a burned log and the scent of a predator (lion or hyena), and recorded the elephants’ responses. You can watch videos of the novel object trials: balloon, burned log and urine. They also asked elephant caretakers to fill out a survey about the personalities of the animals in their care; and, finally, they observed th
[22:50:43] <two2theheadPC0> e elephants interacting with one another in their zoo habitats.

[22:50:49] <two2theheadPC0> From those assessments, Barrett and Benson-Amram learned that the surveys and observations were the most reliable methods to get at elephant personality. Overall, Barrett and Benson-Amram measured traits such as active, affectionate, aggressive, defiant, excitable, mischievous, shy and sociable, which have been studied in other animals as well."

[23:13:40] <Robomot> Beholding Inequality: Race, Gender, and Returns to Physical Attractiveness in the United States1 | American Journal of Sociology: Vol 127, No 1
[23:13:54] <two2thehead> "Physical attractiveness is an important axis of social stratification associated with educational attainment, marital patterns, earnings, and more. Still, relative to ethnoracial and gender stratification, physical attractiveness is relatively understudied. In particular, little is known about whether returns to physical attractiveness vary by race or significantly vary by race and gender combined. In this study, we use nationally representative 
[23:13:54] <two2thehead> data to examine whether (1) socially perceived physical attractiveness is unequally distributed across race/ethnicity and gender subgroups and (2) returns to physical attractiveness vary significantly across race/ethnicity and gender subgroups. Notably, the magnitude of the earnings disparities along the perceived attractiveness continuum, net of controls, rivals and/or exceeds in magnitude the black-white race gap and, among African-Americans, the 
[23:13:55] <two2thehead> black-white race gap and the gender gap in earnings. The implications of these findings for current and future research on the labor market and social inequality are discussed."

[23:19:28] <two2thehead> ggreer, would you say that portland and vancouver are used, for lack of a better word, synonymously?
[23:20:05] <two2thehead> ie there's intermixing of population and economy, so people consider them to be in the same region culturally/politically?
[23:20:26] <ggreer> they're as different as san jose and oakland

[23:21:46] <ggreer> downtown portland has insane crime and is dirty as hell. suburbia portland has lots of "we believe in science" signs and weirdly painted/decorated houses
[23:21:48] <gwern> two2thehead: might be a case where they are different *because* they are so close
[23:22:03] <ggreer> downtown vancouver has like... two homeless people. there used to be three but one was shot to death in self defense
[23:22:03] <two2thehead> hmm
[23:22:19] <gwern> and of course there's probably a connection between suburban portland and downtown portland being like that..
