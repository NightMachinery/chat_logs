[01:03:15] <ChrisKipp[m]> since questions don't seem to be welcome on prs https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/15723#issuecomment-1079399025, what other use cases do semantic tokens via LSP have beside syntax highlighting? the spec is all about highlighting https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_semanticTokens
[01:04:08] *** Quits: rgrinberg (~textual@fixed-186-96-26-198.totalplay.net) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:04:14] <ChrisKipp[m]> and is the ultimate goal for users to be able to set up a mapping and get syntax highlight via semantic tokens, or will there be a lot more setup required for it?
[01:08:13] <clason[m]> Well, "not welcome" is putting it a bit strongly
[01:08:14] *** Joins: Ox000 (~jy@74.215.12.46)
[01:08:52] <ChrisKipp[m]> well passive aggressive comments to people that ask questions isn't exactly a welcoming environment to those interested in the pr
[01:09:12] <clason[m]> But adding a comment remarking on how it's difficult to understand what's going on because of the number of comments was somewhat of an opening.
[01:09:38] <ChrisKipp[m]> which could be solved by updating the original pr description
[01:09:41] <clason[m]> I did answer your questions though.
[01:10:03] <ChrisKipp[m]> > Also, tokens can be used for other things besides highlighting.
[01:10:03] <ChrisKipp[m]> What other things did you have in mind?
[01:10:13] <clason[m]> No, I want to put this PR out of its misery and get it merged.
[01:10:22] <clason[m]> Diagnostics
[01:10:41] <ChrisKipp[m]> sure, my main point (and I get a lot of complaints about this from my plugin users) is that something is marked as "supported" but not really
[01:10:48] <ChrisKipp[m]> so I'm just curious when this is merged what state will it be in
[01:10:58] <clason[m]> Put all unsafe tokens in the quickfix list etc.
[01:10:58] <ChrisKipp[m]> like will a user that tries to set up a mapping get syntax support or not?
[01:11:00] <ChrisKipp[m]> no right?
[01:11:05] <clason[m]> No
[01:11:23] <clason[m]> The alternative is that you get nothing
[01:12:17] <ChrisKipp[m]> understood, just wondering as an LSP feature what this brings
[01:12:31] <clason[m]> So the plan (outlined somewhere in these now 160 comments) was to get the base layer merged for 0.7 and then take the time to do highlighting properly for 0.8

[01:14:32] <ChrisKipp[m]> sure, but I think there is a discord between the idea of sane defaults, and no defaults
[01:14:57] <clason[m]> This is not about defaults, though.
[01:14:59] <ChrisKipp[m]> where someone reads, "cool new X feature!" and then they have to basically code it all out themeselves to use it
[01:15:24] <clason[m]> This is about incremental development to avoid stalling PRs forever.
[01:15:34] <ChrisKipp[m]> in an LSP sense I think it is though. People see LSP and a feature and they are either coming from other editors like VS Code or coc and they just expect the feature to work
[01:15:45] <ChrisKipp[m]> > This is about incremental development to avoid stalling PRs forever.
[01:15:45] <ChrisKipp[m]> Totally, I get this
[01:16:58] <ChrisKipp[m]> either way, I got the context I was looking for. Sorry for the extra noise on the PR.
[01:16:58] <clason[m]> Yeah, but at some point when people are demonstrably incapable of reading and instead go with what they think should be the case, I don't know what you can do at all.
[01:18:09] <clason[m]> (Note that the PR is not merged yet, 0.7 is not released, and the release notes have not been written yet. I can guarantee that they will make clear that semantic highlighting is not yet supported.)
[01:18:28] <ChrisKipp[m]> üëçÔ∏è
[01:19:25] <clason[m]> Yeah, sorry for the tone. That PR is just a sore point because it's taking so long precisely because there's too many comments on it.
[01:19:58] <clason[m]> And I hear you; maybe we won't merge it for. 0.7 after all.
[01:20:16] <mjlbach[m]> Chris Kipp: I think I mentioned on that PR highlighting was explicitly not being added, but the ability to add a callback on semantic tokens 
[01:20:36] <mjlbach[m]> There's a plugin which registers the callback
[01:20:38] <clason[m]> You did
[01:21:14] <mjlbach[m]> Adding highlighting IMO will require a lot more consideration of performance concerns, and exposing an interface that allows enabling or disabling the capability
[01:23:10] <mjlbach[m]> I'm just not super interested in semantic tokens personally so I wanted to get something in core for 0.7 that would allow people who wanted it (for whatever reason) to use it with theHamsta (Stephan Seitz)'s plugin

[01:39:29] <ChrisKipp[m]> although I've seen a POC LSP serve once that offered support for a specific language in markdown code blocks, so I guess maybe that could be one, where the tokens sent in where only for ranges in those blocks while you could also have a markdown language server

[03:34:49] <hwrd> ii14[m] I guess I don't understand why pressing it slower vs faster changes the behavior here?
[03:35:24] <ii14[m]> isn't ttimeoutlen for escape sequences?
[03:35:31] <ii14[m]> or do you mean just timeoutlen
[03:36:11] <hwrd> ii14[m] ignore what I said about ttimeoutlen... why does pressing gc become g@ and pressing g wait c is just gc?
[03:36:56] <ii14[m]> what I think is happening is that there are other mapping too like `gcc`
[03:37:02] <ii14[m]> that comments out the line
[03:37:12] <ii14[m]> so vim doesn't know yet what the mapping is
[03:37:38] <ii14[m]> and only after it time outs (timeoutlen option) it decides that it's the `gc` mapping
[03:37:48] <ii14[m]> and that triggers `g@`
[03:37:56] <hwrd> it's the opposite though
[03:38:06] <hwrd> gc fast becomes g@ immediately
[03:38:16] <hwrd> gc slow it is just gc
[03:38:22] <hwrd> that's the weird part

[03:38:53] <ii14[m]> what is it set to?

[03:41:16] <ii14[m]> why so low?
[03:41:30] <hwrd> I don't recall... perhaps my own impatience?
[03:42:16] <ii14[m]> do you actually have a problem with that? in most cases you can hit escape to cancel it
[03:42:26] <ii14[m]> set it back to the default value, 1000

[04:33:02] <ii14[m]> 1. create a mapping for command line: `:cno -- whatever`
[04:33:02] <ii14[m]> 2. `:set timeoutlen=0`

[04:33:49] <ii14[m]> no, just `whatever`
[04:34:12] <ii14[m]> when you type `--` it should insert `whatever` instead

[04:36:33] <maverun[m]> ahh give me a second
[04:38:17] <maverun[m]> nothing happen cuz timeout went out so fast, i set to 300 then -- again and it show whatever
[04:38:27] <ii14[m]> so no which key window
[04:38:58] <maverun[m]> on that said, also no window if i do 300 as well

[04:39:19] <maverun[m]> dont which key affect only on normal mode?
[04:39:29] <maverun[m]> as far as i recall, it only affect on normal mode

[05:29:33] <ShougoShougo[m]> @nsol86:libera.chat Of course, I am deoplete author Shougo.
[05:31:05] <gpanders> Intelo: are you using nightly/building from source?
[05:32:41] <Intelo> ShougoShougo[m] it works with --clean. I wonder what is stoping it and how to debug. I used telescope to find keymaps but there was no map for c-i

[05:38:17] <ii14[m]> so i guess that's not it
[05:39:30] <ii14[m]> I have the same error tho
[05:42:07] <Intelo> ii14[m] but `nvim --clean` works
[05:42:35] <ii14[m]> not for me
[05:42:53] <Intelo> ii14[m] works for me
[05:42:58] <Intelo> ii14[m] but what is the issue btw?
[05:43:42] <ii14[m]> not sure, looks like a bug
[05:44:01] <ii14[m]> when you prepend it with `<esc>` it works for example
[05:44:31] <ii14[m]> looks like the leading tabs are just ignored
[05:44:51] <Intelo> ii14[m] if it were a bug, it would not have worked with `nvim --clean`
[05:44:54] <ii14[m]> `<esc><c-i>` works, `<c-i><esc>` doesn't
[05:45:13] <ii14[m]> it still does this with --clean for me
[05:45:23] <ii14[m]> I'm on way older version though
[05:46:35] <ii14[m]> yeah that makes sense, it's probably the leading tabs
[05:46:51] <ii14[m]> ctrl-i is the same character as tab
[05:47:14] <ii14[m]> and when parsing command I guess vim skips it
[05:47:21] <ii14[m]> that's my guess at least
[05:49:33] <Intelo> `<esc><c-i>` works
[05:50:09] <Intelo> ii14[m] I agree with that guess. so its a bug?
[05:50:13] <Intelo> how to solve it?
[05:50:46] <ii14[m]> write a fix for vim or neovim :)
[05:51:34] <Intelo> well this is s common. many would have faced it
[05:52:04] <ii14[m]> tbh not sure if you actually can fix it, it'd break a lot of scripts
[05:55:37] <Intelo> ii14[m] is that the case with vim also?
[05:55:47] <ii14[m]> one sec
[05:55:56] <ii14[m]> yes
[05:56:13] <Intelo> but c-i works..
[05:56:30] <Intelo> why isn't it working ? I mean since which version is it not working with nvim?
[05:56:50] <Intelo> and funny that it does works with 'nvim --clean'
[05:56:54] <ii14[m]> I suspect since always. I tested it on vim 8.0
[05:56:57] <Intelo> so what exactly is stopping it
[05:57:05] <ii14[m]> yeah i don't get what's that about
[05:58:10] <Intelo> It is working with :tabnew as well
[05:58:14] <Intelo> i mean in tabs
[05:58:40] <Intelo> ii14[m] I think you can comment out half of your configs and then half to see. like a betree check
[05:59:11] <ii14[m]> Intelo: the issue is that ctrl-i and tab are the same character. spaces and tabs between the command and arguments are ignored
[05:59:45] <ii14[m]> but for me it errors with config, without config and on vim8
[06:00:58] <Intelo> ii14[m] I get it now
[06:01:07] <Intelo> I mapped tabnew to tab
[06:01:17] <Intelo> can I map :tabnew to C-tab?
[06:01:30] <ii14[m]> yes, I think so

[06:12:15] <Intelo> ii14[m] I figured the issue. this was the problem nnoremap <Tab> gt
[06:12:16] <Intelo> nnoremap <S-Tab> gT
[06:12:29] <Intelo> ii14[m] and this does not work.
[06:12:30] <Intelo> nnoremap <C-Tab> gt
[06:12:30] <Intelo> nnoremap <C-S-Tab> gT
[06:12:33] <Intelo> so what do you suggest?
[06:13:13] <ii14[m]> what are you even trying to do?
[06:13:52] <Intelo> :tabnext
[06:14:21] <ii14[m]> what ctrl-i has to do with it?
[06:14:22] <Intelo> on c-tab
[06:14:25] <gpanders> Intelo: you cannot map control-Tab in Neovim
[06:14:37] <Intelo> ii14[m] c-i shoudl have nothing to tod wit hit
[06:14:40] <gpanders> Unless you are using master as of 2 days ago, and a supporting terminal
[06:14:43] <Intelo> gpanders ok.
[06:15:09] <ii14[m]> gpanders: pretty sure it worked before?
[06:15:20] <Intelo> then will live with gt gT or¬† leader-tab?
[06:15:40] <ii14[m]> oh not ctrl-tab, shift-tab
[06:15:47] <ii14[m]> shift-tab should work
[06:16:11] <gpanders> C-Tab might work if you are using kitty or iTerm2 or something
[06:16:36] <gpanders> Since Neovim uses libtermkey which can understand that
[06:16:56] <gpanders> It‚Äôs possible I guess but there are a lot of variables
[06:17:11] <ii14[m]> ctrl-i and ctrl-o goes back and forth in cursor history basically
[06:18:25] <Intelo> gpanders I use kitty
[06:18:29] <Intelo> ¬†but c-tab dont work
[06:20:55] <Intelo> I mapped it to Leader-Tab now
[06:21:08] <Intelo> ii14[m] gpanders solved by this.
[06:21:09] <Intelo> thanks
[06:23:15] <Intelo> but you know, leader-tab is slow
[06:23:19] <Intelo> its two buttons
[06:25:42] <Intelo> ii14[m] gpanders any suggestions here on mappings ?
[06:26:39] <gpanders> No, I don‚Äôt use tab pages very often and when I do I just use gt and gT

[15:04:08] <mjlbach[m]> The PR is pretty simple
[15:04:29] <Shadman[m]> Yeah üôÇ

[16:36:32] <NerdyAnarchist[m> So I had to use vimdiff for the first time last night, and as it loaded, I got a bunch of errors (essentially a line per entry in my Plug section) saying "Not an editor command", followed by a "cannot find color scheme" - do I have to somehow disable my plugins and color scheme for that somehow?
[16:37:22] <NerdyAnarchist[m> s/somehow//
[16:38:52] <NerdyAnarchist[m> oh, and an "Unknown function" before the plug#begin & plug#end lines
[16:39:16] <mjlbach[m]> no, it sounds like there is something wrong in your config
[16:39:16] <mjlbach[m]> wait
[16:39:33] <mjlbach[m]> when you say "vimdiff" you mean `nvim -d` or `:diff` right?
[16:40:34] <NerdyAnarchist[m> oh, you know what? I just used the default under git's mergetool command...let me set that specifically in my git config
[16:50:21] <NerdyAnarchist[m> <mjlbach[m]> "when you say "vimdiff" you mean..." <- okay, found a couple examples to copy from, so I guess I'll find out if it works next time I need to do a merge, lol - thanks for pointing me in the right direction 
[16:50:46] <NerdyAnarchist[m> but I did run nvim -d and it didn't give me any issues, so I think it'll be just fine
[16:53:29] <NerdyAnarchist[m> (I'd been using "vi" and "vim" aliased to nvim for so long, that I'd forgotten that it doesn't just pop in on its own when something calls for vim)

[18:41:57] <galvao> One sec... just noticed something
[18:44:11] <galvao> OMG... I think there's an error on vim-plug's readme
[18:44:54] <galvao> it says to install it at .config/nvim/site/autoload, but should be .config/nvim/autoload <- that solved it
[18:46:52] <galvao> well... actually it says to install at ... /.local/share ... but anyway
