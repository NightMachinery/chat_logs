[01:16:06] <mvaname[m]> - I dislike sumneko-lua LSP server by couple of reasons including telemetry, and monstrousity,
[01:16:07] <mvaname[m]> Hi there! Advice me, please, what should I do in following situation:
[01:16:07] <mvaname[m]> `
[01:16:07] <mvaname[m]> - But suddenly it stopped to work (lspconfig started to ignore that config, since it only checked them on "default" paths, or something like that)
[01:16:07] <mvaname[m]> - So, I ended up with rewriting that to lua-section in vimrc, and doing something like:
[01:16:07] <mvaname[m]> - And since there is no plugin for vim-lsp in nvim-lspconfig's box, I did custom "pack" for nvim (it had server definition (like ones in lua/lspconfig/*.lua) on that moment)) and I loaded it with packadd mypackname.
[01:16:08] <mvaname[m]> `
[01:16:08] <mvaname[m]> lsp_config.lua = { <definition> }
[01:16:08] <mvaname[m]>  
[01:16:08] <mvaname[m]> lsp_config = require'lspconfig/configs'
[01:16:09] <mvaname[m]>

[04:16:20] <JackPordi[m]> My snippets work now btw, thanks a lot maverun 
[04:16:30] <maverun[m]> awesome! what was solution?
[04:17:16] <JieruMei[m]> mjlbach[m]: I am using LunarVim.
[04:17:24] <JackPordi[m]> `require("luasnip/loaders/from_vscode").load({ paths = { "~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/opt/friendly-snippets" } })`
[04:17:45] <JackPordi[m]> Had to make sure that it's finding friendly-snippets in the right place (in opt, not start)
[04:17:52] <maverun[m]> ah i see
[04:18:16] <maverun[m]> i feel like this is not correct solution (but work), you can ask folks at #luasnip to confirm
[04:18:30] <JackPordi[m]> I wonder why lazy_load() didn't work though
[04:19:23] <JackPordi[m]> Oh incredible as I say that, lazy_load seems to work now when it very much wasn't earlier...
[04:20:18] <JackPordi[m]> Also another stupid question - what's the action/configuration for going to the "next field"?
[04:22:00] <JackPordi[m]> nvm found the docs I think
[04:22:19] <maverun[m]> good luck mastering it

[04:24:21] <JackPordi[m]> on another topic - I'm not a fan passing lua within vimscript within a string when remapping from lua api:

[04:24:49] <JackPordi[m]> Is there an api that allows passing in a lua function directly to that 3rd argument?
[04:24:49] <maverun[m]> i just shortcut it
[04:24:55] <ii14[m]> no, but you can make a function registry yourself
[04:25:33] <ii14[m]> simply have a table, a global counter and assign each function to the next unique id
[04:26:31] <JackPordi[m]> I can see how that would work but god that feels like such an awful workaround though. Am I the only one who thinks it would make sense for them to add in support for lambdas directly?
[04:26:33] <ii14[m]> and then you can return a string like for example `'<cmd>lua require"registry".fn['..id..']()<CR>'`
[04:26:57] <Bowuigi[m]> JackPordi[m]: No but you can use something like `<cmd>lua yourfunction()<CR>`
[04:27:10] *** justache is now known as zoite
[04:27:14] <ii14[m]> it makes sense, and it will get done, but just isn't yet
[04:27:15] <Bowuigi[m]> And put that as a function itself
[04:27:32] <JackPordi[m]> Bowuigi but its _still_ a string "<cmd>lua yourFunction()"
[04:27:32] <ii14[m]> right now this is the only option you have
[04:28:01] <Bowuigi[m]> JackPordi[m]: Yeah, but you can hide that away
[04:28:06] <Bowuigi[m]> ii14[m]: I like that
[04:28:36] <Bowuigi[m]> `id` can be a string (function name) since tables are hash tables

[04:31:00] <ii14[m]> and then `map('lhs', registry.register(function() print('sup') end), {})`
[04:31:05] <ii14[m]> or something like that

[04:31:28] <JackPordi[m]> These workarounds are perfectly fine make sense in a world where lambda support isn't there but I would still prefer lambda support lol
[04:31:31] <maverun[m]> is that a moon lord?
[04:31:41] <ii14[m]> you can wrap nvim_set_keymap that checks the type and does it automatically
[04:31:55] <ii14[m]> JackPordi[m]: that's great but as I said it's not done yet
[04:32:05] <ii14[m]> you have to wait for it

[10:38:46] <b0o> Is there a way to make search() start from a line other than the cursor line?
[10:40:32] <numToStr[m]> b0o: I would use `string.{find,match}` and `nvim_buf_get_lines`
[10:41:04] <b0o> yeah that's what I'm doing now, but I want the feature of search() to go backwards
[10:41:36] <b0o> i have implemented backwards and forwards search but it'd be cool to rely on someone else's definition of it :p
[10:42:33] <b0o> also figured search() might be faster
[10:42:33] <numToStr[m]> Well there might be something. After all vim is a rabbit hole.
[10:43:53] <numToStr[m]> AFAIK search() uses vim regex which might be slower than lua counterparts.
[10:44:47] <b0o> I already need to use a vim.regex because Lua's patterns don't support optional or repeated groups
[10:46:26] <b0o> oh, what I can do is actually just run two searches, one backwards and one forwards, with the 'c' flag on one of them to include the cursor line

[10:58:51] <kylo252[m]> I've also ran into another issue that was causing what looks like a segfault. I think I'm gonna make a PR for the fix
[11:00:46] <numToStr[m]> b0o: It looks fine as you also said. I had to do similar traversal thingy for one plugin I am working on. IDK if someone comes up a with one sneaky vim builtin function which we don't know about.
[11:03:20] <windwp[m]> you can use vim.regex or vim.fn.substitute

[12:20:41] <XVilkaAntonKochk> Congratulations! Looks like not in the https://neovim.io/ news though
[12:21:00] <clason[m]> No, writing the release newsletter takes time
[12:21:01] <thinkofher> i'm wondering, time duration between release of 0.5 and 0.6 was singificant smaller than between 0.4 and 0.5, will it be the new standard to have smaller releases?
[12:21:07] <clason[m]> Usually about a week
[12:21:25] <clason[m]> That's the goal, at least; although releases are still feature-driven rather than timed
[12:21:45] <clason[m]> in this case, vim.diagnostic was a big enough feature to merit a version bump (yay gpanders!)

[12:24:39] <thinkofher> and my daily use is pretty heavy because i'm using neovim all the time as replacement for IDEs
[12:24:56] <clason[m]> expect that to change again, though -- it is the development branch, after all, and especially early in a release cycle breakage is accepted

[12:50:38] <johnche> hi, im wondering if the problem i have is a regular bug: when having two buffers split vertically, scrolling the right one will also scroll the left buffer
[12:50:59] <johnche> this is not the case if i scroll the left buffer, the right buffer is left where it is. also, scrollbind is set to noscrollbind
[12:51:20] <johnche> whats even weirder is that the left buffer that follows scroll doesnt render the new lines
[12:51:29] <johnche> unless cursor is put on the actual line
[12:51:34] <johnche> anyone familiar with this?
[12:52:00] <johnche> running neovim with the flag -u NORC doesnt change the behavior

[13:13:39] <hhhapz[m]> Hey guys, have an internal IDL language that I use, and wanted to build a syntax highlighter for it. I came across https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Creating_your_own_syntax_files which is neat but regex simply isn't powerful enough for what I am aiming for. Is it possible to make syntax highlighting for file types that is slightly more complex? Notably we have tags which use syntax that are parsed within comments and bare strings and wanted syntax
[13:13:39] <hhhapz[m]> highlighting for that. Preferably, being able to write this in Go would be even better, as that's the language the current compiler for the IDL is written in

[18:25:47] <YorickPeterse[m]> So I managed to isolate a bunch of language servers with Bubblewrap last night (goodbye sleep), but ugh it's a bit finnicky
[18:26:01] <YorickPeterse[m]> especially having to figure out what directories a server needs access to
[18:27:37] <YorickPeterse[m]> e.g. use wise you end up with something like this: https://gitlab.com/yorickpeterse/dotfiles/-/blob/bwrap-lsp/dotfiles/.config/nvim/lua/dotfiles/lsp.lua#L262-270
[18:27:47] <YorickPeterse[m]> Which isn't too bad
[18:28:04] <mjlbach[m]> Why bubblewrap them?
[18:28:06] <mjlbach[m]> (Just curious)
[18:28:15] <mjlbach[m]> security concerns?
[18:28:59] <YorickPeterse[m]> Part as an experiment, part because I feel a language server (or really any application for that matter) should have unrestricted access to `$HOME` and beyond
[18:29:09] <YorickPeterse[m]> but sandboxing on Linux is tricky business
[18:29:57] <YorickPeterse[m]> In a parallel universe, we all use BSD with a more integrated experience (e.g. not 15 different libc versions), and all is well
[18:29:59] <YorickPeterse[m]> but alas
[18:30:03] <mjlbach[m]> Also language servers are incredibly finnicky about what they need access too
[18:30:47] <YorickPeterse[m]> My biggest issue so far is that most don't document where their config/cache files are/etc

[18:30:59] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah

[18:31:20] <YorickPeterse[m]> But then without bwrap it spits out some other error
[18:31:35] <YorickPeterse[m]> lua-language-server was pretty easy to sandbox
[18:31:41] <mjlbach[m]> Is it easier in a container? with bwrap do you get a fs error if it tries to write somewhere you have not shared?
[18:32:37] <YorickPeterse[m]> Yeah bwrap will say "no" if you try to write where not allowed

[18:32:50] <YorickPeterse[m]> In fact, if you haven't mounted something it straight up isn't visible
[18:32:52] <mjlbach[m]> It's kinda tricky, I had an idea for an "lsp-installer" that used a static container runtime (non-privileged) but then many things assume the container and host share the same libraries
[18:32:54] <YorickPeterse[m]> a bit like a chroot
[18:32:57] <mjlbach[m]> like clangd
[18:33:05] <mjlbach[m]> yeah the containers is easier because it has it's own filesystem
[18:33:07] <mjlbach[m]> s/containers/container/
[18:33:18] <YorickPeterse[m]> bwrap can do that too
[18:33:42] <mjlbach[m]> Oh why not for your case?
[18:33:43] <YorickPeterse[m]> e.g. in my setup it has read-only access to `/usr` and some common lib/bin directories
[18:33:57] <YorickPeterse[m]> then I mount the project root over that in read-write mode
[18:34:07] <euoiaJamesPickar> @clason:matrix.org thanks for your help looking at that issue, I've created an issue in andymass/vim-matchup https://github.com/andymass/vim-matchup/issues/199
[18:34:56] <sunjonSenghanBri> why would you start with isolating just the LSP servers (again, out of curiousity) ?
[18:35:31] <YorickPeterse[m]> sunjon (Senghan Bright): see my comment above
[18:35:51] <YorickPeterse[m]> <YorickPeterse[m]> "Part as an experiment, part..." <- this
[18:35:53] <sunjonSenghanBri> I saw
[18:36:02] <sunjonSenghanBri> "or any application for that matter"
[18:36:10] <YorickPeterse[m]> mjlbach: so in my setup you end up with something like this: `bwrap --ro-bind /usr /usr --symlink usr/bin /bin --symlink usr/bin /sbin --symlink usr/lib /lib --symlink usr/lib /lib64 --dev /dev --proc /proc --tmpfs /tmp -
[18:36:10] <YorickPeterse[m]> -unshare-pid --bind /home/yorickpeterse/Projects/rust/playground /home/yorickpeterse/Projects/rust/playground --bind /home/yorickpeterse/.cargo /home/yorickpete
[18:36:10] <YorickPeterse[m]> rse/.cargo --bind /home/yorickpeterse/.rustup /home/yorickpeterse/.rustup /usr/bin/rust-analyzer`
[18:36:15] <sunjonSenghanBri> so you have the main process and 100 plugins, + some LSP servers
[18:36:34] <YorickPeterse[m]> that basically isolates it filesystem and PID wise, but still has RW access to some places it needs to
[18:36:34] <sunjonSenghanBri> why not the whole caboodle, and work on minimizing it

[18:37:05] <YorickPeterse[m]> how do you sandbox something that effectively needs read-write access to everything

[18:37:15] <sunjonSenghanBri> not practical
[18:37:16] <YorickPeterse[m]> Might as well eat my shoes
[18:37:32] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah
[18:37:44] <YorickPeterse[m]> I thought about at least PID isolating neovim, and just sharing the filesystem
[18:37:45] <mjlbach[m]> I played around with this because PG has been asking about plugin security
[18:37:46] <YorickPeterse[m]> but that's not super useful
[18:37:53] <mjlbach[m]> but sandboxing plugins is a fool's errand IMO
[18:37:59] <sunjonSenghanBri> isolating the LSP's doesn't solve anythign, that was my point

[19:16:14] <YorickPeterse[m]> option 2 is easier (e.g. no messing with dbus), but it's debatable whether it's useful

[20:45:09] <YorickPeterse[m]> Not exactly something useful for plugins though, since they all run in-process (at least the Lua ones)
[20:45:18] <mjlbach[m]> yeah
[20:45:21] <mjlbach[m]> that's cool though :) 
[20:45:29] <mjlbach[m]> glad you figured it out!
[20:46:21] <YorickPeterse[m]> I think for in-editor sandboxing you need some sort of setup where NeoVim itself has access to everything, but anything going through Lua has to use some kind of capabilities system

[20:47:06] <YorickPeterse[m]> For plugins you'd probably have to straight up disallow access to anything but e.g. `~/.config/FOO`, PWD, and maybe `~/.cache/FOO`
[20:47:17] <mjlbach[m]> it's easier than that
[20:47:27] <YorickPeterse[m]> but this gets super tricky, as editors in general assume access to everything

[20:50:22] <YorickPeterse[m]> I guess using that you'd just not expose `os` & friends?
[20:51:06] <mjlbach[m]> Yeah
[20:51:29] <wastrel> para continuar en espa√±ol presione nueve ahora
[20:51:49] <YorickPeterse[m]> Hm, in that case I think you'd have to force plugins to go through a controlled FS API, that then acts on a whitelist/blacklist of some sort I guess
[20:52:04] <mjlbach[m]> yeah but you soon realize it's hard to do anything useful
[20:52:06] <YorickPeterse[m]> if it's just "give me filesystem access", then all plugins will do exactly that
[20:52:07] <mjlbach[m]> like
[20:52:13] <mjlbach[m]> even keymaps can be bad
[20:52:48] <YorickPeterse[m]> I think it depends on what you are trying to protect against. At least in my view, sandboxing is more about not exposing the filesystem and other processes to some random plugin from Bob from accounting

[20:54:51] <YorickPeterse[m]> haha yeah it's kind of by design
[20:55:21] <YorickPeterse[m]> and it largely works because it's all open/public
[20:57:22] <mjlbach[m]> There are soooo many potential security problems on a linux desktop that I think neovim is not the lowest hanging fruit, tagging plugins and inspecting the source (someday in a central ELPA like repo) is probably the best you can hope for
[20:57:23] <mjlbach[m]> (IMHO)
[20:58:16] <YorickPeterse[m]> oh yeah. I also think it helps that managing dependencies in nvim is a bit of a pain
[20:58:23] <YorickPeterse[m]> so you get plugins that don't really depend on other plugins too much
[20:59:45] <mjlbach[m]> we've been talking about luarocks for that
[21:00:06] <mjlbach[m]> (not sure if you saw the stream but Lewis Russell independently suggested that as well), teto has been looking into it

[22:14:56] <wastrel> unstable is a constantly changing, testing is a snapshot of unstable

[22:15:48] <sunjonSenghanBri> is Fedora RedHat's 'testing' ?

[22:59:55] <Ayresia[m]> Hey there, I have this issue where the lsp, i'd assume is not catching up the type and instead showing it as text.
[22:59:55] <bfredl> I just listened to a twitch stream about frognanobots, no worry
[23:00:03] <mjlbach[m]> Ayresia[m]: what
[23:00:10] <mjlbach[m]> going to need a rephrase

[23:03:06] <Ayresia[m]> Apologies, basically I have this issue which happens quite regularly (but not everytime), Inside the function block, whenever i write the name of an argument, it would show as 'Text' as the screenshot is shown which is supposed to be a referenced Context, which also does not show the attributes of context and instead it would display nothing.
[23:03:27] <Ayresia[m]> (I don't know whether it's understandable or not)
[23:03:42] <mjlbach[m]> I'm still having trouble following
[23:03:50] <mjlbach[m]> presumably you are using the built-in language server client with rust analyzer
[23:03:58] <Ayresia[m]> yes.
[23:04:06] <mjlbach[m]> You type ctx?
[23:04:29] <Ayresia[m]> yeah, so there is one of the arg which is named ctx for context
[23:04:49] <mjlbach[m]> Ok, and then what happens
[23:04:51] <Ayresia[m]> but it doesn't show any suggestions at all
[23:04:57] <mjlbach[m]> With nvim-cmp?
[23:05:04] <Ayresia[m]> yep
[23:05:07] <mjlbach[m]> or omnifunc?

[23:05:10] <Ayresia[m]> This is another example
[23:05:24] <mjlbach[m]> The server might not be able to infer the arguments
[23:05:33] <mjlbach[m]> s/arguments/child methods/properties/
[23:05:47] <Ayresia[m]> I don't know whether this is normal or not.
[23:05:51] <mjlbach[m]> Can you try with manually triggered omnifunc?
[23:06:06] <mjlbach[m]> (c-x c-o if you've set it up like the lspconfig snippet suggests)

[23:20:30] <gadkadoshgadkado> Has anyone also had the situation where with winblend > 0, the cursor inside a floating window is hardly visible?
[23:20:58] <sunjonSenghanBri> you can override the blend setting for a particular hl-group
[23:21:17] <sunjonSenghanBri> try setting `blend=0` in your `Cursor` highlight definition
[23:22:27] <gadkadoshgadkado> still the same
[23:29:14] <sunjonSenghanBri> blend=100 turns the cursor off, but doesn't scale 0-99
[23:29:22] <sunjonSenghanBri> I guess that's terminal dependant
[23:30:03] <sunjonSenghanBri> which terminal?
[23:30:14] <gadkadoshgadkado> I guess that's possible.
[23:30:23] <gadkadoshgadkado> It's alactitty
[23:34:24] <sunjonSenghanBri> what's your cursor hl definition? try setting it to specifically guifg/guibg/blend, and not any 'reverse' or similar params
[23:35:06] <gadkadoshgadkado> Cursor         xxx guifg=#24283b guibg=#c0caf5

[23:38:12] <gadkadoshgadkado> In fact the issue is only when the cursor is on a white space
[23:40:00] <sunjonSenghanBri> try setting `hi! Cursor guifg=#24283b guibg=#c0caf5 blend=0 gui=nocombine`
[23:40:15] <sunjonSenghanBri> that's about as explicit as a definition could be, I think
[23:40:34] <sunjonSenghanBri> then other than that, out of ideas

[23:52:56] <gadkadoshgadkado> @UndeadLeech:libera.chat cool, thanks! I just noticed the cursor is also not blinking in alacritty while it is in kitty - is that also related?
[23:53:25] <UndeadLeech> Not sure what Kitty's defaults are, but Alacritty has blinking disabled by default unless explicitly requested by an application.
