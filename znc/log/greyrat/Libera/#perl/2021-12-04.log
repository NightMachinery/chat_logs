[16:15:58] <rindolf> LeoNerd: :(
[16:16:11] <huf> do we actually have a package called 0?
[16:16:16] <huf> does anyone use it?
[16:16:33] <huf> wouldnt it be better to not support it and put an extra line in the docs? :)
[16:16:36] <LeoNerd> There's -a- module that makes use of it.. It's really really really annoying
[16:16:43] <huf> can we just shit on it?
[16:17:02] <LeoNerd> No, because that would make a visible difference between  if(blessed $obj)  and   if($_tmp = blessed $obj)
[16:17:07] <LeoNerd> which would be madness
[16:18:15] <huf> a package named 0 is also madness
[16:18:21] <huf> we're beset by madness on all sides
[16:18:25] <LeoNerd> Wellyes, but actual code actually uses it :/
[16:18:35] <huf> naughty
[16:19:23] <LeoNerd> I forget quite what it's called, but there's a lazy-type module on CPAN which uses package "0" to hide its lazy boxes, so  ref $box  appears false
[16:19:27] <LeoNerd> It's a stupid hack of a trick. I hate it
[16:21:16] <LeoNerd> In other news, I might have an attack today at core perl's op.c, a single file of C source code 630k in size, containing 18k lines

[16:36:45] <vms14> what do you think about blessing closures instead of hashes?
[16:37:17] <vms14> I mean when I saw the perl object concept for me was kind like a joke
[16:37:34] <LeoNerd> blessed closures can be handy. but they aren't easily extendable

[16:38:22] *** Joins: chiselfuse (~chiselfus@user/chiselfuse)
[16:38:37] <LeoNerd> Honestly these days, if you wanted an object, just write using an actual object system
[16:38:38] <vms14> or at leaast you have encapsulation by default and allows you to return different stuff depending on the call
[16:39:15] <vms14> but I've heard some time ago something like closures in perl are left in memory 
[16:39:28] <LeoNerd> That doesn't sound even remotely true
[16:39:31] <vms14> which idk and even if it was tre idk if holds anymore
[16:39:42] <vms14> true*

[16:40:54] <vms14> LeoNerd: I think it was the variables inside the closure like not being able to be fully destroyed as it still had handles
[16:41:16] <LeoNerd> It's sometimes possible to create a cycle, yes. But no moreso with that technique than anything else in perl
[16:41:26] <LeoNerd> my $arr = []; push @$arr, $arr;  # oops now I have a cycle
[16:42:01] <ehuelsmann[m]> or any of the other refcounting scripting languages (Python?)
[16:42:15] <LeoNerd> I think Python has some sort of cyclebreaker though
[16:42:23] <vms14> wwell I won't worry about and start making objects as closures xd
[16:42:50] <vms14> I feel like a blessed hash can't fully represent an object

[16:43:10] <vms14> even if you patch stuff to make it behave as one

[16:50:28] <LeoNerd> Or Object::Pad, given that actually creates nice lexicals and is the shape of the thing I'll be adding to actual core perl
[16:50:36] <LeoNerd> Though, probably not in time for 5.36. Maybe 5.38
[16:51:07] <vms14> will perl7 ship with a closs-like object system?
[16:51:19] <LeoNerd> That question is kinda backwards
[16:51:34] <vms14> I have read something about an object system
[16:51:34] <LeoNerd> Once perl has enough features we feel that a new major version number is justified, we'll call it 7. yes
[16:51:54] <LeoNerd> I think a real object system would be a good candidate to go on that list of features, yes
[16:51:56] <vms14> well, we could have 6 since 6 is raku
[16:52:08] <LeoNerd> 6 is too tainted now. next major will be 7.
[16:52:21] <vms14> i mean no one will have any objection if the new release of perl 5 is 6
[16:53:19] <vms14> LeoNerd: don't hace the link, but read something about multipl dispatch and alike

[16:54:02] <LeoNerd> Random people-on-the-internet can write random things on the internet yes. I wouldn't pay much attention unless it's a fairly authoratitive source
[16:54:16] <LeoNerd> For example... one of the three people on the Perl Steering Council. ;)
[16:56:23] <vms14> https://gist.github.com/Ovid/68b33259cb81c01f9a51612c7a294ede
[16:56:25] <vms14> this
[16:56:52] <vms14> well not sure
[16:56:58] <LeoNerd> Yes that's the design spec half of what is inspiring Object::Pad, which is the inspiration for what I'm writing for core
[16:57:07] <ehuelsmann[m]> LeoNerd: how do the method modifiers (before/after/around) behave? Like with Common Lisp? (that is: all modified methods from all inherited classes run before the current main method?)
[16:57:20] <LeoNerd> ehuelsmann[m]: How? No idea; I haven't written any of them yet.
[16:57:39] <LeoNerd> https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=136395  has context
[16:57:46] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. I'll rephrase: "How will the method modifiers ...*"
[16:57:54] * ehuelsmann[m] reads
[16:57:58] <LeoNerd> Go read --^ :)
[16:59:12] <vms14> you'll need to make something to port major cpan modules to perl7 as much automated as posibble
[16:59:30] <vms14> the major feature of perl is cpan
[16:59:40] <LeoNerd> What makes you think that is a question?
[16:59:48] <LeoNerd> There's no need to "port modules to 5.36" for example...
[17:00:00] <LeoNerd> Perl remains backward compatible. We have no plans to change that
[17:00:05] <vms14> and being a major release will likely to crash old stuff
[17:00:05] <LeoNerd> -even- across major version bumps
[17:00:15] <vms14> I mean won't be like 4 to 5?
[17:00:19] <LeoNerd> This is what I mean about "we'll just call it 7"
[17:00:46] <LeoNerd> We'll keep adding new features exactly as we've always done, to make 5.36, 5.38, 5.40, ... and at some point we'll decide "youknow what, this feels like enough of a new language. we'll call it 7"
[17:00:48] <LeoNerd> And that will be it
[17:01:23] <vms14> cpan and freedom is what makes me use Perl
[17:01:41] <vms14> as long as you don't break this I'm fine :D

[18:09:25] <El_Che> perlbot-os is the next step
[18:12:12] <simcop2387> El_Che: longer term i am planning a small rpi cluster for doing all the evals.  probably a turing pi v1 board + compute module 3 boards.
[18:15:04] <simcop2387> at that point i'll also be opening up the api a bit more to be hammered by any kind of client.  it's all really open now but i'll actually encourage it then
[18:15:52] <simcop2387> ok time to get dressed and go give an extra $350 to my landlord.  gonna get a cat after next week
[18:21:30] <El_Che> a rpi cluster is the affordable geeky dream
[18:21:37] <El_Che> so, you pay extra for a cat?
[18:25:52] <simcop2387> yea pet fee on the lease.  350 isn't unreasonable for that in my experience.  before my last cat passed, i had her setup as an Emotional Support Animal to deal with landlords that would try to screw me about having a pet.  had to use it twice, once to prevent one from deciding "no cats, we're trying to evict you" and another trying to get me to sign a lease without pets on there and then wanted
[18:25:58] <simcop2387> to add another $1000 on top to update it.
[18:26:19] <simcop2387> with the ESA stuff in california they're legally forbidden from charging or evicting over it.  i only ever used it in defense from crap like that

[20:27:25] <perlbot> simcop2387-web: Hi :) Have a look around!
[20:27:30] <ology> Long shot: Anyone worked with perl PWM control of an LED with their raspberry pi and an electronics kit?
[20:28:08] <ology> The python GPIO code works but the perl side is ...lacking so far. 
[20:28:21] *** Joins: perldoc (~perldoc@24.88.49.194)
[20:28:29] <simcop2387> ology: not directly, but i wrote a pwm i2c chip bit for Device::Chip some time ago.  likely needs work though
[20:28:46] <ology> I will check it out!
[20:31:59] <simcop2387> there should be a way to do it directly on some pins though, i see altmodes for PWM0, PWM1, etc. in HiPi but I don't see any obvious way to use them

[20:33:16] <ology> I like https://metacpan.org/pod/RPi::WiringPi so far. HiPi has no direct pwm methods.

[20:33:45] <simcop2387> i *think* it'd be doing a set_pin_mode() to that alt mode, and then using set_pin_pud() to set the user data for the frequency and such but i have no idea how that works.
[20:34:02] <simcop2387> yea wiringpi might be easier to use for that
[20:34:54] <simcop2387> ology: https://metacpan.org/release/STEVEB/RPi-WiringPi-2.3633/source/examples/sg90_servo.pl this should be identical for pwm-ing an LED.  the way those servos work is that you PWM a pin and adjust the duty cycle to adjust the position of the servo.  from your perspective it's the same thing
[20:34:54] <Paperbot> Link title(s): [ examples/sg90_servo.pl - metacpan.org ]
[20:35:05] <ology> Ooo
[20:35:40] <simcop2387> it's a result of the way that those servos were designed back in the 70s for remote control stuff with 27MHz transmitters and everything :)

[20:39:51] <simcop2387> ology: yea you'll need to find the other two pins to do that.  the other two are going to be on likely GPIO 12,13, or 19.
