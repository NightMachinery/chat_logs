[20:53:55] <schmudde> Where are people storing their non-sensitive configuration files? So far I've just been storing such things in /resources, but then it get's compiled in the .jar. Not such a big deal... but are there other preferences? The project root?
[20:54:26] <schmudde> I'd like these configuration files to be part of version control.
[20:57:45] <ridcully> resource is a good place.  if they are in the jar it means, your application can at least run.  then provide means to override things

[20:58:59] <ridcully> there are libraries like aero, that help with that.  or you can just merge things to make it work (e.g. if some override is present via envvar)
[20:59:51] <technomancy> never run into any problems with using resources/ myself
[21:01:04] <schmudde> yeah - I love Aero. That's how I'm using it. There is one problem, however...
[21:02:17] <schmudde> I am bringing in one setting that can be changed by the program at runtime. So I have a separate configuration file for these settings. It may change how the program boots the next time.
[21:02:24] <ridcully> i mean, if your application is totally self-sufficient, i'd guess, you could place your overrides into dev?
[21:02:51] <ridcully> dev/ is part of the cp in e.g. the repl, right?
[21:03:03] <Para> I have a simple override check with my aero, but by default it comes from resources.
[21:03:04] <ridcully> or is this some magic from clojure, that it picks up dev (my guess is: no)
[21:03:21] <Para> Usually either an argument passed to main or env var.
[21:03:55] <technomancy> ridcully: dev-resources rather
[21:03:58] <Para> And I'd recommend writing your configs in such way that you don't need multiple variants of the file :)
[21:04:18] <ridcully> oh good point
[21:04:40] <schmudde> Yeah, I keep all my configs in one file. It's much easier to navigate, you're right Para.

[21:07:30] <schmudde> Thanks for the thoughts everyone. It's a good sanity check. I just need a place to put this runtime state I'm saving. Aero actually bring it in at bootup, which is really nice. 
[21:07:46] <schmudde> I'd love to keep both in /resources, but writing to a file in the .jar is widely frowned upon. 
[21:08:36] <Para> stuff like `{:dbport #long #profile {:ci 4832 :default #or [#env DB_PORT 5432]}}` (if I got that right, of course) covers pretty much all use cases I've ever had with configs :)
[21:09:05] <Para> plus the aforementioned option of optionally defining an alternate path for the config file itself
[21:09:53] <ridcully> oh you want to modify it.  then i'd still go with the "known good setup in jar" - but have a script around, that adjusts the cp and have an "empty" config where you plan to write in the filesystem (or even just have an default where to write to)
[21:10:02] <ridcully> don't override the config in the jar

[21:59:08] <ridcully> really?  not for some META-INF/services BS?

[22:11:19] <sobel> it has some file it needs to load from a classpath it hardcodes, and it's not the same when uberjar packages
[22:11:38] <sobel> separate from the wsdl i need it to consume
[22:11:47] <sobel> also which has to be available on the classpath
[22:12:24] <sobel> i so hate legacy xml crap but i have all my SOAP clients working, albiet on a knife-edge

[22:13:42] <ridcully> interesting.  unless you have a cp clash (which is very unlikely with .class), uberjar is fine.  the problems i whitnessed only arose with META-INF crap

[22:14:09] <ridcully> and xml is a prime candidate for META-INF/service shenanigans
[22:14:16] <sobel> i'm sure the file it packs and expects to load from the cp is in meta-inf
[22:14:31] <sobel> i put my wsdl in resources/
[22:14:37] <ridcully> i even had trouble with spring-boot, which does its own fatjar, with a dedicated class loader
[22:14:52] <sobel> IntelliJ builds the only all-in jar that works
[22:14:56] <sobel> in my case
[22:14:57] <ridcully> yeah, well i have no clue about soap
[22:15:05] <sobel> so i don't bother with it. i need automated stuff. :)

[22:15:22] <sobel> lein cp really covers me nicely

[22:17:10] <ridcully> yeah, `with-profile uberjar` weeds out most of the useless things
[22:17:49] <ridcully> i answered on SO recently for a similar problem and i really wonder, if there is room for a "application" plugin for lein...

[23:05:33] <Para> Oh. Windows dark mode uses black as transparency background color for PNGs in Explorer preview. I guess this is technically correct, even though Explorer background is still white...
