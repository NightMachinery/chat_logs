[06:32:39] <ekl> i was wondering.. i'm having various issues using brew on 10.13
[06:32:51] <ekl> and actually, i can't upgrade to anything more than 10.13 on that
[06:32:55] <ekl> mac
[06:33:32] <ekl> (it's a 2011 mac mini, i just need ffmpeg4 but rust is a dependency and doesn't buid, and the only reason reported as error is "you are using 10.13")
[06:34:22] <ekl> actually, i expected to be able to continue using a system with the most recent version of software available for that configuration, keeping it up to date with brew (not only, but..)
[06:34:56] <ekl> reading that 10.13 warning, i'm thinking that i was ..wrong
[06:37:33] <ekl> my macbookpro runs catalina now.. i guess i should expect to have brew packages "suddenly unsupported" and possibly meet build and dependency errors like that in about a year, when the next os release will be out?
[06:40:18] <ekl> just to have a general idea, because i'm still using various old macs in perfect conditions with limited software upgrade options as servers, but if this is the common policy, i can't expect to use brew to install software
[06:43:03] <ekl> if this is the point, even upgrading this mac mini to catalina using "unsupported methods" will end up in a non-supported os in a few months, so i should probably spend time finding another way to install stuff, because i really can't expect to see run anything like big sur or later on a 2011 server 
[08:01:50] <tdsmith> ekl: that sounds like homebrew's support policy, yes

[15:33:13] <ekl> ok tdsmith, thanks, i'll re-think the whole strategy
[15:33:51] <ekl> it's likely that macports could end up as being a better solution for those systems while i'll keep both on recent systems

[20:46:32] <greyrat> When I install a package with `brew install --head ...`, where is the git repo stored?
[20:52:46] <tdsmith> somewhere in ~/Library/Caches/Homebrew maybe?
[20:54:30] <greyrat> yes, that's it
