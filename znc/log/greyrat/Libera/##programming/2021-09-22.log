[00:44:51] <love42> do you know how to make a sentient ai? the vector interrupt table wasnt enough

[00:45:03] <love42> yes you can
[00:45:06] <pulse> we don't even know what consciousness is
[00:45:18] <pulse> to program something you kind of have to know what it is
[00:45:23] <pulse> and be able to formalize it
[00:45:25] <love42> well i mean we can do a con job and just say its sentient
[00:45:27] <pulse> which we can't even remotely do
[00:45:29] <alycidyne> pulse: e.g. a feature to save data in a certain format shouldn't be directed towards the original devs at all, but at specialists in both the program and the format
[00:45:50] <Rounin> You could just dd /dev/urandom and hope against all odds that it would output a sentient AI
[00:45:53] <love42> there was a research paper that sentience is being able to talk to oneself
[00:45:54] <alycidyne> (in the context of programs being developed according to very narrow formal specifications)
[00:45:55] <Rounin> Technically not impossible
[00:46:03] <love42> or use a neural net?
[00:46:11] <Rounin> Assuming consciousness can arise from a deterministic system of course...
[00:46:13] <pulse> Rounin, i don't think that would work either :p
[00:46:22] <pulse> not even if you could do it for infinity

[00:47:11] <alycidyne> love42: I would say one major criterion for sentience is possessing the means to avoid "stress" situations, where stress is defined by the AI
[00:47:12] <pulse> so i don't really think AI is possible
[00:47:27] <love42> come one try harder
[00:47:31] <love42> what about a self aware bot
[00:47:47] <alycidyne> pulse: one major behavior of living things is the fight-or-flight response, which requires a stress criterion.
[00:48:03] <love42> suppose its a psychopath and only reasons logically
[00:48:07] <love42> also you can code those in

[00:53:03] <love42> i made a pinkie promise i will be gud :3
[00:53:06] <alycidyne> Every reasoning is irrational because one must *choose* to reason; we can make it as rational as we wish, however, by extrapolating it, assuming perfect knowledge
[00:53:29] <pulse> the only possible way we know how to do a good AI is to adjust its environment until we can control all variables. real world contains too many variables so generic AI is impossible
[00:53:50] <love42> no but you can get all of a computers inputs and outputs

[09:34:04] <beaky> yes like in coq and agda you can have existential quantification (tho they call it sigma types) they let you have function expressions right in the type and i think haskell has it too but doesn't let you have functions in the expression (it doesnt have dependent types) tho there's refinement types which sorta but aren't like existential quantification (sorta in that they let you specify the
[09:34:06] <beaky> conditions as if they were function calls)
[09:34:56] <flaknet99> i had a feeling beaky would know
[09:35:18] <flaknet99> ada has it as well
[09:35:49] <beaky> languages without dependent types will have it but it will be type-level (like generics lets you do universal quantification on types where the 'function' is a parametrized types)

[09:50:54] <beaky> yes sigma types in those dependently-typed programming languages are like existential quantification and the values of the sigma type are a pair of a 'witness' (which can be a plain old value as in the usual existential quantification or a type itself thanks to types-as-values and working with dependent types) and a proof with that witness, and existential types like in haskell or other
[09:50:56] <beaky> lagnuages with it are like the case of the sigma type where the witness is itself a type, so it will be like having an abstracted type and the predicate will be used to specify what you're allowed to do with that abstracted type

[10:10:49] <pyzozord> what I was trying to do before was: collect all peaks, compute distances between neighboring peaks, compute frequencies of distances, find the frequency with highest count, create prefix sum where each frequency is a sum of itself and all greater distances.

[11:05:06] <beaky> eqquation is now  sum of odd series up to n+1 = (sum of odd series up to n) + 2n + 1, then "unfold" the odd series by one step (using its definition of odd 2n+1 ), , and then both sides are now equal you can apply reflexivity and thus complete teh proof qed

[11:45:53] <flaknet99> the question is how lightweight is lightweight
[11:45:53] <Donitz> UWP is insane
[11:45:57] <Donitz> it asked me to log in to compile
[11:46:27] <pyzozord> sounds like you are more after "simple to use" than "lightweight" as in kilobytes
[11:46:37] <Donitz> well preferably it should be a single lib
[11:46:41] <Donitz> which gives you a nice simple gui

[11:49:57] <pyzozord> what how tui works? you just send escape sequences to stdout
[11:50:09] <Donitz> judging by the name
[11:50:13] <Donitz> text-based gui
[11:50:20] <pyzozord> they even have escape sequences for mouse now
[11:50:21] <Donitz> eh, that's a bit too retro
[11:50:27] <pyzozord> yes, text-based gui
[11:50:45] <pyzozord> so what, easy, cross-platform, light-weight, and does the job well
[11:50:56] <pyzozord> unless you need to display images or fonts etc

[14:31:59] <pyzozord> yeah if you can do frontend and backend and you are not bothered by either then you are full stack imo :P
[14:31:59] <The_Blode> This CV is quite impressive man
[14:32:07] <pyzozord> thanks :)
[14:32:09] <The_Blode> Is full stack including DB?
[14:32:20] <The_Blode> So SQL, mySQL, mongo etc?
[14:32:38] <pyzozord> I think recruiters mostly understand fullstack as frontend + backend
[14:32:43] <The_Blode> I'm not joking I am blown away by this
[14:32:44] <pyzozord> and backend must include some sql
[14:32:51] <The_Blode> Got it

[14:33:06] <merijn> full stack has become entirely meaningless

[14:33:36] <akronymus> Speaking of JS:
[14:33:42] <The_Blode> I know JS so I could potentially get ReactJS and VueJS under my belt quickly?
[14:33:47] <merijn> Full stack, when it was first introduced in the context of Google's SRE position used to mean "actual *full* stack" (like, kernel/drivers all the way up to browser JS)
[14:33:49] <pyzozord> well angular is more annyoing because it's big, more like traditional backend framework
[14:34:02] <merijn> Now full stack just means "not just frontend/not just backend"
[14:34:13] <akronymus> Somehow a website I have to use to see certain things has vue js set up so that when I try to scroll, it is SLOW
[14:34:25] <The_Blode> I think the employer would be intimidated by the amount of skills and experience...but is that a good or bad thing?
[14:34:29] <pyzozord> yes I am amining at becomeing th full stack in the original meaning

[15:38:06] <beaky> yes to not be turing complete the lemma you need is somr equivalent of 'everything terminates'
[15:38:23] <mrig> Well lets be honest, there is a lot of space to become complete in.
[15:38:26] <merijn> pyzozord: So, in STLC all expression have types. And notably, whenever you apply a function the type "shrinks"
[15:38:45] <beaky> like in dhall the alternative to yaml
[15:38:56] <merijn> pyzozord: Which means you can prove that *all* evaluation strategies converge to the same state of "all types shrunk to minimal" at which point there is nothing left to evaluate
[15:39:27] <merijn> pyzozord: So, provably, all evaluation of STLC stops *at some point*
[15:40:45] <merijn> pyzozord: Untyped lambda calculus lets you implement the Y-combinator (which doesn't type check in STLC) which can *grow* (i.e. add more evaluatable sub-experssions), which means the same proof doesn't apply there
[15:41:09] <pyzozord> oh wow, that's some sophisticated theory to be /not/ turing complete
[15:41:35] <beaky> yes this is one of the proofs they make you do in the software foundations volume 2 book

[15:44:13] <merijn> Coq and Agda only low recursion like this, where the input to the recursive step is "smaller" (for some notion of smaller) than the input of the original

[15:45:09] <akronymus> Which are useful
[15:45:44] <merijn> The simplest example is "induction on natural numbers", if a function terminates with input 0 and you prove all recursive calls are with a number smaller than the input, then the recursion on natural numbers is trivially terminating

[22:14:54] <Samian> next question, last for the day I promise!
[22:15:10] <Samian> Suppose you have a bunch of if this, then sys.exit, if that then sys.exit.   Would you use if .... if... if.... if... ? or if .... elif .... elif... elif... ?  Code path is the same either way
[22:16:11] <pyzozord> I normally would use the first form. Today I learned that the first form breaks structured programming principles. I'll be experimenting more with the second form
[22:16:14] <wedr> Samian, I would stick with elif, unless you have a very elegant solution to handle multiple IF blocks handling logical OR executions

[22:17:12] <wedr> ugh, no vocabulary words to describe a workflow that's not part of the specifications.
[22:17:16] <user51> GeDaMo: so, irealized what i liked about forth
[22:17:24] <user51> a lot of stuff can very nicely map to stacks
[22:17:41] <user51> but if it doesn't map to a stack - well, you've got a problem
[22:17:55] <pyzozord> Samian: well i used the world "princeples" somewhat loosely, but you'll find something interesting looking for structure programming anyway
[22:18:19] <mrig> I like ending the function early if I can, it is more readable.
[22:18:39] <GeDaMo> If it doesn't map to a stack, you're doing it wrong :|
[22:19:08] <user51> give me an example of how to do it right :)
[22:19:08] <mrig> you can't tell otherwise if something else is happening lower down in the function, if there is a return, then you know that it is done.
[22:19:24] <MrMobius> hmm but then there's the myth in forth that you only need 3 levels of stack. that only really holds for toy programs
[22:19:42] <MrMobius> so youll need to resort to "locals" which in every other language are called globals

[22:20:28] <pyzozord> MrMobius: 3 levels of stack, as in only 3 elements on stack at any given time?
[22:20:31] <Intelo> beaky I wish I could see function call chains in type of diagram generated by my code. It's nicer to visuallize. like a(p1,p2) -> b() -> c() so one
[22:20:57] <Intelo> Is that possible in javascript/typescript ?
[22:21:42] <MrMobius> pyzozord, ya thats the rule of thumb
[22:21:58] <MrMobius> well you can have other stuff lower down in the stack but youre only using 3 at a time
[22:22:52] <GeDaMo> 2ROT uses 6 single stack items
[22:25:04] <MrMobius> sure you can use that and other stuff like PICK and ROLL and use as much stack space as you want but that gets unmanageable very quickly which is why i think 3 is what you usually hear people say

[23:21:47] <vdamewood> validation is verifying that the input meets a certain spec. Sanitization is the process of ensuring that an input won't cause the program to behave in an unexpected way.
[23:22:05] <Helmholtz> like when I change user input +4 -> 4, did I sanitize?
[23:22:18] <Helmholtz> or throw error when he uses a char instead of number
[23:22:44] <Helmholtz> yeah I sanitize...tnx
