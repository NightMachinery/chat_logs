[13:22:02] <Bunny351> sjamaan: I think it will make things harder, indeed
[13:22:19] <sjamaan> :/
[13:22:39] <Bunny351> it's just a big piece of work, but as long as I can keep things in my head, it is doable (I think)
[13:23:46] *** Quits: crumpo (~crumpo@user/crumpo) (Quit: Buh bye)
[13:23:48] <Bunny351> and there will be a performance impact, not only in indexing.
[13:24:24] <Bunny351> on the other hand we can suffix the bytevectors holding strings with a null byte, which allows passing them to foreign code directly without copying
[13:25:28] <Bunny351> but all buffering for ports must be done at the bytevecvtor level, so we need a full bv-API (using r7rs as a base, I guess)
[13:25:51] <sjamaan> I'm not sure we can - what if there's a 0 codepoint embedded in the text itself?
[13:25:56] *** Joins: crumpo (~crumpo@user/crumpo)
[13:25:58] <Bunny351> and (as jcowan suggested) use native bytevectors for u8 vectors
[13:26:22] <Bunny351> isn't that disallowed anyway?
[13:27:05] <Bunny351> but that's the problem on the C side, the same would happen now
[13:27:17] <Bunny351> and you can always pass a bv + len
[13:27:45] <sjamaan> It looks like it's allowed by the standard to reject embedded NUL characters
[13:28:34] <sjamaan> Might make sense to do that
[13:28:57] <Bunny351> I don't think it is necessary, but we'll see
[13:29:35] <Bunny351> things like string-intersperse, etc, need to be optimized though. but first we need a working runtime
[13:31:41] <Bunny351> thanks, btw, for the added assertions in the access macros, they will be very helpful.
[13:32:00] <sjamaan> ^_^
[13:32:03] <Bunny351> and I need your advice on using the scratch buffer for intermediate alloc in string-set!, but I"ll get to that later
[13:32:13] <sjamaan> Sure
[13:33:31] <Bunny351> jcowan didn't answer, but perhaps you can tell me how (say) char-upcase is supposed to work with cahrs that expand to multiple chars ("ß")
[13:33:54] <Bunny351> e.g. ß -> SS
[13:34:12] <Bunny351> char-upcase must return a char, right?
[13:35:10] <Bunny351> to avoid bootstrapping problems, we can keep code to handle old-style strings encoded in literals in C files
[13:35:17] <Bunny351> I hope that is sufficient
[13:36:37] <wasamasa> there is actually an uppercase ß
[13:36:41] <wasamasa> it looks silly as fuck
[13:37:38] <sjamaan> > (string (char-upcase #\ß))
[13:37:38] <sjamaan> "ẞ"
[13:37:41] <sjamaan> ^ that's Chibi
[13:37:47] <wasamasa> yes, that's the one
[13:45:20] <sjamaan> Is that something the Unicode committee made up?
[13:45:32] <sjamaan> I mean, as Germans you'd presumably know if it existed
[13:46:50] <wasamasa> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9F#Substitution_and_all_caps
[13:47:14] <wasamasa> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9F#Development_of_a_capital_form
[13:47:41] <wasamasa> it's a relatively recent addition
[13:50:24] <Bunny351> There is no uppercase ß, it is just a hack to make unicode work.
[13:50:45] <wasamasa> https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro%C3%9Fes_%C3%9F
[13:51:45] <Bunny351> well, there is no such thing, you use "SS", as in Schutzstaffel
[13:51:58] <gahr> https://www.rechtschreibrat.com/DOX/rfdr_Bericht_2011-2016.pdf#8
[13:52:06] <gahr> there *was* no uppercase ß
[13:52:31] <gahr> section 2.1
[13:52:36] <sjamaan> Der Grose Duden <- The big Dude?
[13:52:42] <wasamasa> lol
[13:52:50] <gahr> haha
[13:53:26] <Bunny351> oh, the "rechtsschreibreform", another one of those "hacks"...
[13:54:27] <wasamasa> that report is hilarious
[13:54:28] <sjamaan> I wonder how that was supposed to work in early unicode versions though
[13:54:33] <wasamasa> Ketschup
[13:55:56] <Bunny351> vandusen: I REFUSE TO SUPPORT UPPERCASE ß!

[14:03:26] <sjamaan> Oh, in that case never mind
[14:10:15] <mario-goulart> Could the utf8 egg be used as a reference for the expected behavior for utf8 things?
[14:11:20] <mario-goulart> I actually didn't know that the upcase version of ß was the same symbol, just a little fatter.
[14:13:15] <Bunny351> yes, I'm actually more or less translating Alex Shinn's code to C, at least for case conversion
[14:13:16] <mario-goulart> I heard that stupid symbol is only used by Germany's German.  All other German variants have eradicated it.
[14:13:59] <Bunny351> there is nothing stupid about ß, it is just a special case. it is stupid to introduce the same symbol again for uppercase, just because german administrators are unable to cope
[14:14:21] <mario-goulart> There's ss and SS.
[14:14:34] <Bunny351> bureaucracies and standards committees, they will fubar everything, if you let them
[14:14:58] <mario-goulart> ß looks like you failed to write a proper B.
[14:15:27] <Bunny351> the old style ß really looks a bit like sz
[14:30:34] <Bunny351> utf8 doesn't provide character case predicates... is that an intended omission?
[14:31:37] <Bunny351> ah, only r7rs defines them for unicode
[14:37:36] <fantazo> mario-goulart: hey! we like our ß
[14:42:13] <mario-goulart> fantazo: how come!
