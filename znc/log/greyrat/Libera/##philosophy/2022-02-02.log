[00:24:45] <ProfSimm> Ok let's start simple.
[00:24:50] <ProfSimm> Do you believe in pizza.
[00:25:04] <iryith> no
[00:25:09] <iryith> pizza is a verifiable object
[00:25:25] <ProfSimm> Ask a christian, God is verifiable entity to them too
[00:25:35] <xx> it must take some effort to not believe in physical objects

[00:25:51] <iryith> what do YOU do
[00:25:59] <iryith> and what is your objective with the line of reasoning?
[00:26:29] <ProfSimm> I'm eating pizza right now and trying to extract life lessons from the experience
[00:26:32] <Delf> xx: The mental thought patterns play heavy role in your life
[00:26:54] * xx shrugs
[00:27:00] <ProfSimm> But ultimately pizza is an illusion.
[00:27:08] * iryith barfs
[00:27:12] <ProfSimm> I see it disappear piece by piece
[00:27:15] <xx> can't say I'm aware of any mental thought patterns that would be close to any known religion
[00:27:31] <ProfSimm> xx: do you believe in science
[00:27:40] <xx> ProfSimm: no
[00:27:48] <xx> science is not about believing it
[00:27:59] <ProfSimm> xx: all right, so I guess gravity doesn't exist
[00:28:19] <xx> your guess would be wrong
[00:28:37] <Delf> xx: I know you can't. Otherwise you would've take done something to avoid them
[00:29:05] <xx> Delf: not sure what you mean there
[00:29:06] <ProfSimm> Anyway, let's start over. Religion is a mental model like any model.
[00:29:17] <ProfSimm> They're all "wrong" too. Subjective.
[00:29:25] <ProfSimm> So they should be judged on utility, not correctness.
[00:29:33] <ProfSimm> Is it useful to believe in God? Could be.
[00:29:40] <xx> ProfSimm: disagree. Religion is a model that cannot be perfectly reconstructed if all knowledge of it disappears.
[00:29:40] <ProfSimm> Certainly useful to the Pope I guess
[00:30:05] <xx> whereas most other models will reapppear exactly as they were if everyone forgot about them
[00:30:10] <ProfSimm> xx: I don't think a single model we have can be perfectly reconstructed
[00:30:41] <ProfSimm> xx: simultaneously there are repeating patterns between different religions.

[00:35:20] <Delf> xx: I mean the moment we notice that we harbour religious thought patterns, we also notice their danger and the heavy/unnecessary assumptions that we make so we naturally try to avoid them
[00:35:49] <xx> don't know much about materialism, but do know that it takes some evidence to convince me of stuff in general, and no religion so far was able to provide evidence

[00:38:41] <xx> ProfSimm: I'm unconvinced about black holes so far, more evidence and study is needed.
[00:39:07] <ProfSimm> xx: could be

[00:39:43] <ProfSimm> xx: it's not our only evidence of black holes btw
[00:40:02] <ProfSimm> xx: the orbits of stars in milky way's center map to it perfectly
[00:40:11] <xx> yes, the math is there
[00:40:16] <xx> and has been for a long time
[00:40:35] <ProfSimm> xx: not exactly. We're talking about data from observation, not just abstract math.
[00:40:37] <xx> I'm just saying that one picture like that is not enough as a definitive proof for me, but it's getting close
[00:40:54] <ProfSimm> xx: we've recorded the star orbits
[00:41:03] <xx> ProfSimm: observing black holes, and observing effects of black holes, are separate things
[00:41:08] <ProfSimm> xx: is it
[00:41:27] <ProfSimm> xx: how do you observe something, and not the effects of it.
[00:41:30] <xx> effects of black holes can be attributed to various theories on dark matter too
[00:41:37] <ProfSimm> You see just air oscillation and see reflected light
[00:41:54] <xx> at least that's for stellar orbits

[00:42:28] <ProfSimm> Dark matter isn't matter that's dark.
[00:42:40] <ProfSimm> It's matter that doesn't exist.
[00:42:52] <xx> orbits depend on a lot of mass in some point, but that point doesn't have to be infinitesimal
[00:42:54] <ProfSimm> But our formulas need a correction

[00:44:44] <ProfSimm> xx: when you die, all this knowledge you have about every single thing, will vanish.
[00:44:59] <xx> ProfSimm: can't say I care about what happens after I die
[00:45:05] <ProfSimm> xx: if consciousness lives on, then, you might find yourself in utterly different world

[00:46:08] <ProfSimm> xx: consider that a preview
[00:46:27] <Delf> xx: Yes. It is a belief that is heavy enough for us to not question it but rather defend it. Whatever it may be about. Usually it's regarding our understanding of "reality", our relationship to it and our understanding of ourselves
[00:46:55] <xx> Delf: that sounds a bit too abstract for me, can you give a more specific example?
[00:47:05] <xx> like, what's "heavy" about all that?
[00:49:15] <ProfSimm> xx: you have a set of believes you've accepted as self-evident and not up to questioning. Let's call that axioms, it's what an axiom is. When the brain settles on axioms, it starts building other models on top of those axioms. If they someone challenges your axioms, that's literal brain trauma. So you'll defend your axioms.
[00:49:26] <ProfSimm> xx: conversely having no axioms will drive you mad
[00:50:02] <ProfSimm> xx: because you have no structured way at all of seeing the universe.
[00:50:18] <Delf> xx: Consider for example your belief regarding death, what it means, what you think death means. Have you considered the possibility of your belief about it being wrong?
[00:51:28] <Delf> ProfSimm: It's simple, you work with assumptions instead of axioms, that way your brains don't have to defend stuff and also you don't become mad. But I suppose it's a little too late for me now
[00:52:18] <xx> ProfSimm: everything is up for questioning
[00:52:36] <xx> even F=ma

[00:53:43] <xx> like, so what if I'm wrong?
[00:54:09] <ProfSimm> If you believe everything is just an assumption, then during a high stress moment, the chance of you ending up psychotic increase significantly
[00:55:25] <ProfSimm> Consider it like an application trying to run, while a key part of the operating system disappears or becomes corrupted.
[00:55:35] <Delf> xx: You've obsoleted any need for critical navigation by throwing out any reason for us to exist
[00:56:03] <ProfSimm> Delf: is there a reason. I wish I knew it

[00:56:24] <ProfSimm> Delf: I guess I'll need a moment to process that mental image

[00:57:30] <xx> ProfSimm: the universe will keep on existing even if humans go extinct, and even if that's wrong and the universe would cease to exist, then it's not like any human will mind
[00:57:49] <xx> because all the humans would be gone by then
[00:58:49] <ProfSimm> xx: well fair take, but I mean let's eliminate all humans and see what happens. The key issue is who will observe the results
[00:59:01] <ProfSimm> xx: I suppose we invent AI first
[00:59:09] <xx> sure, robots can observe the result
[00:59:26] <xx> in fact, robots might help reach that result
[00:59:42] <xx> but it would be much simpler to just stop the continuous breeding of humans
[00:59:43] <ProfSimm> xx: they might but technically it's just evolution for us
[01:02:12] <Delf> xx: You've done your part. And I'm not going to reproduce either, you've already thanked me for that. Do you want me to stand in the way of others breeding? It's not really my thing
[01:03:31] <xx> It's up to you whether you want to spread the message further, it's not a religion
[01:04:50] <xx> I don't even intentionally spread it further, it just comes up so often in conversations that "there are too many people", so it is natural for me to say that it doesn't have to be that way, and that we can get to that point even without unnatural massive loss of life
[01:05:57] <xx> basically the only people who oppose it are making a bet that if we keep on breeding more and more people, and perhaps breed them even faster, then someone special might be born who'll find the solution to the problem of having too many people

[03:39:02] <xx> sure
[03:39:42] <Delf> It wasn't a yes/no question mate. It was a question regarding the motivation and reasoning for the adopting of kids
[03:39:56] <xx> I didn't read properly
[03:40:18] <Delf> It happens, we have auto-incorrect onboard, not just in our phones :P
[03:40:36] <xx> I guess I haven't found a good reason not to adopt when I have the means
[03:40:53] <xx> they already exist
[03:41:00] <xx> it's not adding an extra person to the world
[03:41:16] <xx> and I might as well tell them that they don't have to add an extra person to the world either
[03:41:58] <Delf> So they reason with you, and they don't reproduce. Then what?
[03:42:35] <xx> then what?
[03:42:59] <Delf> Yes, why have them?
[03:44:22] <xx> guess it's the same thing as putting the shopping trolley back, putting garbage in garbage bins instead of just throwing it out of the car, not sticking chewing gums to various surfaces, ...
[03:44:35] <xx> adopting kids is like that
[03:45:16] <causative> well, the problem is that it's a self-defeating mentality in the long run:  those who follow your ideas will gradually go extinct
[03:45:35] <xx> doesn't bother me, I'll be dead by then
[03:45:37] <Delf> Why is the default to adopt, even with absence of reason to adopt?
[03:45:57] <xx> Delf: because it doesn't increase the number of people on the planet compared to breeding new humans
[03:46:03] <causative> xx that sounds like you actually don't care about what happens to the planet in the long run
[03:46:18] <xx> causative: does anyone?
[03:46:24] <causative> you earlier said: <xx> it's not adding an extra person to the world
[03:46:28] <causative> the two perspectives seem at odds
[03:46:48] <causative> on the one hand you're concerned about not causing harm to the planet, and on the other hand you don't care what happens because you'll be dead
[03:46:59] <xx> oh it's not about causing harm to the planet for me
[03:47:27] <xx> I just don't want humans to breed and want them to voluntarily go extinct
[03:47:56] <causative> well, that will not happen, because there will be some who will breed despite this and those are the ones who will leave descendants
[03:48:00] <xx> the goal holds merit for me on its own, irrelevant of any other benefits it brings
[03:48:18] <xx> causative: sounds like argument to futility
[03:48:24] <causative> if humans go extinct it surely won't be because of everyone voluntarily deciding not to breed
[03:48:51] <causative> there are realistic ways humans could go extinct, but that's not one of them
[03:48:51] <xx> causative: even if some choose not to breed it still helps
[03:49:09] <causative> all it does is mean that the people who remain are genetically even more disposed towards breeding
[03:49:19] <xx> the number of childfree/anti-natalist/vegan people are going up

[03:49:31] <causative> and eliminating them from the population
[03:49:44] <xx> various other environment people numbers are going up too
[03:49:52] <causative> childfree genes eliminate themselves from the gene pool
[03:49:57] <xx> all seem to share the view that there are too many people out there
[03:50:17] <xx> probably everyone who spends too much time in traffic too
[03:50:54] <causative> if there's a problem in society, a self-defeating solution is not going to solve it
[03:51:15] <xx> humans don't seem to be slaves to their own genes to that extent
[03:51:21] <causative> "just voluntarily don't have kids" is in the long run self-defeating, because of Darwin
[03:51:24] <xx> there's no "decide to be childfree" gene
[03:51:36] <causative> no single such gene, but plenty of contributors
[03:52:16] <xx> are there plenty of contributing genes that make someone go vegan?
[03:52:34] <xx> sounds like a choice that's completely irrelevant of genetics (in absense of food intolerances)
[03:52:52] <causative> well, consider how much sexual attraction someone feels for the opposite sex - that's genetics at work
[03:53:01] <causative> and if they have a lot of that, then they're more likely to have kids and less likely to be childfree
[03:53:22] <xx> people can have sex without breeding
[03:53:32] <causative> it's contributory
[03:53:41] <causative> or consider how much education a person has - there are genetic contributors to that, and more education leads to fewer children
[03:54:02] <Delf> Other then having the kids not reproduce, what would you say makes you fit for being a parent, xx?
[03:54:11] <causative> or consider physical attractiveness:  if someone is genetically physically unattractive, they may be less successful at finding a mate and therefore more likely to be childfree
[03:54:23] <xx> Delf: I can spend more money on a kid than an orphanage could
[03:54:27] <causative> or consider fertility problems:  often genetic, again leads to being childfree
[03:54:39] <Delf> xx: Bribing kids!?
[03:54:51] <xx> Delf: not sure how that's a bribe
[03:55:22] <causative> or just, set those aside and let's pretend that someone chooses to be childfree purely based on their selfless empathy towards mankind
[03:55:25] <xx> it's to do with orphanages not being able to provide as much or good food, shelter, whatever else huamns need
[03:55:38] <causative> well, selfless empathy is a personality trait that is in part genetically determined
[03:55:58] <causative> so if those with selfless empathy choose not to have children, the amount of selfless empathy in the world decreases over time, thanks to Darwin
[03:56:12] <xx> causative: sure, there may be some genetic contributor, but I state that it is not overriding everything else
[03:56:15] <Delf> Who is this Darwin, his becoming a problem
[03:56:23] <xx> Delf: he's dead
[03:56:27] <xx> not a problem anymore

[03:56:39] <causative> it's not a question of overriding anything
[03:56:46] <Delf> Having selfless empathy people decreasing
[03:56:48] <causative> it's just a question of what happens in the long run
[03:56:57] <xx> in the long run, humans go extinct
[03:57:21] <causative> because of nuclear war or disease or rogue AIs, maybe

[03:57:44] <Delf> If I'm working the orphanage, sure
[03:57:49] <causative> in the long run, assuming no disasters, the personality traits that lead people to not have children, are going to be selected against

[04:05:38] <Delf> No offense taken, but that's for clarifying
[04:06:09] <causative> they won't, and they don't, xx - it won't be a *perfect* job. There will always be *some* childfree people

[04:31:38] <ProfSimm> Empathy is not perfect.
[04:31:41] <Delf> You fucking control it...

[04:32:33] <Delf> Can you elaborate why it does not sound healthy, xx?
[04:32:37] <ProfSimm> Empathy actually has shortcomings. You can be manipulated through it. Taken advantage of. Misled. In fact it can be used to make you hurt yourself and others.
[04:32:51] <xx> Delf: to feel pain when others are in pain?
[04:32:59] <xx> it's literally in your head

[04:35:43] <ProfSimm> xx: it's not debated.
[04:35:45] <xx> or at least still was last I looked at it

[04:41:16] <xx> Delf: lately I know HR's have been looking for doctors who are more resistant to the whole corona situation
[04:41:25] <xx> which likely correlates to less or no empathy
[04:41:34] <ProfSimm> xx: resistant how
[04:41:44] <xx> ProfSimm: not suffer from PTSD
[04:41:58] <xx> basically so that they don't quit after a couple months
[04:42:20] <Delf> Those make good doctors?
[04:42:25] <ProfSimm> Great so Corona divisions are staffed with psychopaths now
[04:42:36] <xx> Delf: well it's better for hospitals to have doctors than to not have doctors
[04:42:45] <xx> and if doctors are quiting due to ptsd, then that's a problem

[05:37:31] <ProfSimm> Cool, I don't know about the anime, not sure how it fits in
[05:37:36] <ProfSimm> Might be good tho
[05:37:55] <amigojapan> kmh said the anime was good
[05:38:00] <ProfSimm> Great
[05:38:22] <amigojapan> Apparently it happens in the same world with different characters
[05:38:27] <ProfSimm> Nice
[05:38:31] <ProfSimm> So it uses the setting
[05:38:35] <ProfSimm> That's wise

[15:57:29] <arryana> my favorite theory on after death belongs to a friend of mine

[16:09:14] <Lumine> I can't really say more here, without causing a possible avalanche
[16:09:54] <arryana> hm
[16:10:09] <arryana> i don't see why you shouldn't.  it undoubtedly beats most of the talk here.
[16:15:38] <Lumine> Well it's subversive to say the least. And most people can't contain the notion of the approach emotionally. I've talked to a bunch of people about it and they seem to get nervous for the very idea. Because they think that if one relates to death with something other than morbid seriousness, they might become a menace to society and disregard the rules.
[16:18:37] <xx> what rules?
[16:18:46] <Lumine> Society's rules of course
[16:18:53] <xx> what rules specifically?
[16:19:01] <arryana> i don't think i understand
[16:19:19] <xx> like I know lots of people who joke about death all the time or have funny ideas about it
[16:19:28] <xx> I don't think they are breaking any rules
[16:23:01] <Lumine> Well maybe I'm assuming too much then, I've just drawn that conclusion because people go apeshit over little things all the time, much less than regarding death as a jest.
[16:31:31] <arryana> i still don't know what you mean
[16:31:39] <arryana> can you be a little more specific about your idea?
[16:32:18] *** Joins: choozy (~choozy@75-63-174-82.ftth.glasoperator.nl)
[16:38:31] <Lumine> Well we usually think death is the end-all limit to our life. And because of that, we tend to take it very seriously. And my suggestion is simply to regard it not as something serious but more like the necessary counterpart for existing, and not taking it too seriously. It's hard to say what the idea is with so few words, which is why the article will be huge.

[16:46:45] <arryana> death is an inevitability, that's all
[16:47:12] <arryana> it sucks for the people who lose someone they love, it's disappointing for people who don't feel like they did 'enough' with their lives
[16:47:23] <arryana> but even grief is a stage.
[16:48:58] <arryana> i'm still not at all sure what your premise is, though
[16:59:13] <Lumine> The premise is that we dismiss and ignore such a big thing as death until almost our last breath. And I try to show that it can not only be unhealthy to do so, not dealing with it, but destructive, because we then get into all kinds of acts where we get anxious about death, and our actions reflect that. People for example are so afraid of dying, that they cause their own death in that process, as was the case of my father. Now, I'm not
[16:59:13] <Lumine> speaking for everyone obviously.

[17:03:23] <arryana> hm
[17:03:54] <arryana> i can't say i have much experience with that view, lumine
[17:04:23] <arryana> very few of the people in my life are overly concerned about dying, most of us have taken care of dying people, and we more or less all see it as part of life.
[17:05:10] <Blankspace> What is the whole point of life
[17:05:22] <arryana> most people who hide from death are really using it as an excuse to hide from life.
[17:05:39] <Lumine> Interesting point
[17:05:56] <arryana> but really living is messy, hard work, and requires effort and bravery.
[17:06:02] <Blankspace> You come you fight you laugh you cry you work and you die
[17:06:24] <Blankspace> And you love and you create another life
[17:06:36] <arryana> i'm not sure when it happened, but it seems to have become the goal of a great number of people to just sit on their asses and do... nothing.
[17:07:02] <arryana> spouting opinions and feelings has largely replaced accomplishing actual things
[17:08:02] <Blankspace> What's the whole point of accomplishing things when you're not gonna take it to afterlife
[17:08:21] <Lumine> The point is to enjoy yourself
[17:08:27] <Blankspace> And also most important you're going to die
[17:08:28] <Lumine> While it lasts
[17:09:18] <arryana> i don't think i can agree, lumi
[17:09:41] <arryana> a lot of the important things in life aren't 'enjoyable', but they're necessary for a decent level of living
[17:10:18] <arryana> take the sad sacks who live in filthy houses because they spend hours and hours a day playing wordle/on facebook/etc instead of doing the dishes and washing the floors
[17:11:22] <arryana> the idea of endless hedonism is unfortunate.  it totally lacks balance
[17:13:10] <Lumine> You can clean while fully having fun. This was proven by the Zen folks. Where whatever activity they were engaged in, if your mind was really in it, could be considered enjoyable. But that is hard to do sometimes. The point isn't hedonism. The fact you are enjoying yourself is more like a byproduct of being in the present.
[17:13:20] <arryana> the idea that life should just be 'enjoyable' at all times is the epitome of selfishness.  and selfish people are miserable.
[17:13:35] <arryana> oh, there's certainly a way to be at peace with what one has to do
[17:15:06] <Lumine> The idea that life should be enjoyable at all times is dishonest furthermore, nobody can sustain a state of euphoria at all times.
[17:15:46] <arryana> it seems flat to me.  like always having your favorite flavor of ice cream to eat.  but nothing nutritious, and nothing else.
[17:16:07] <arryana> and i don't see much potential for growth in it
[17:16:09] <Lumine> But I was making that point of enjoying yourself because we sometimes need that state of mind, when we're miserable because of our own thinking.
[17:16:30] <arryana> it's generally the difficult and painful experiences which broaden our worlds the mose
[17:16:39] <arryana> ah
[17:16:53] <arryana> i don't have an internal dialogue, so i can't say as to that.
[17:17:15] <Lumine> I'm not saying that the ultimate purpose of being alive is to have fun, nothing would happen if that was the case
[17:17:41] <arryana> hm
[17:18:22] <Lumine> I'm only saying that we have the capacity to live in such a way as to not be overly anxious
[17:18:44] <arryana> i'd argue that comes from balanc, not enjoyment
[17:19:42] <arryana> i think balanced people who live balanced lives naturally enjoy their lives more, but that's a byproduct, not a goal

[19:35:38] <arryana> heya iryith

[19:36:36] <iryith> yeah, doin alright, about to hop on the bike. You?
[19:37:04] <ProfSimm> It seems we want to layer our own custom reality on top of actual reality and hope if we pretend hard enough, the real reality is no longer irrelevant.

[19:37:38] <ProfSimm> Such as making sex irrelevant. I actually wish it was. I'd probably swap genders a dozen times forth and back if it was the case.
[19:37:51] <ProfSimm> Instead... we really have no such technology
[19:38:19] <iryith> so in your world view there is no room for mental nuances not based on physical 'reality'?
[19:38:53] <ProfSimm> iryith: I think your question is a bit too vague for me to say "yes" or "no" to it
[19:39:19] <iryith> I'm confused on where you draw the line between 'custom reality' and 'actual reality'
[19:39:50] <arryana> i wouldn't invest too much in it, iryith.  this dude has publicly stated that he doesn't believe much of what he says, he says it just to 'stir the waters and watch the waves'
[19:39:52] <iryith> I'm guessing you enjoy some activity or proclivity that is normally ascribed to the opposite gender, is that considered a custom reality?
