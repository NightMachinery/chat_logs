[00:03:40] <edm> neovim is apache is that helps
[00:03:54] <edm> if it doesnt' help, neovim is still apache
[00:13:46] <gerikson> I wonder how much dislike of Emacs is related to a dislike of GNU stuff in general
[00:14:07] <gerikson> and yes I know there are other Emacsen than the GNU one
[00:14:45] <edm> i my case, not at all
[00:14:49] <edm> i just like vim
[00:14:58] <edm> therefore i dislike emacs
[00:17:31] <ngoldbaum> i think it’s more about modal editor people vs lisp weenies
[00:17:36] <Brekkjern> Honestly, it's probably more that emacs does not have a PR department
[00:17:53] <ngoldbaum> vim is also newer so at one point in the 90s it was the new hotness and emacs was the old bloated dinosaur
[00:17:54] <Brekkjern> I don't have the faintest fucking clue what emacs is except for an OS that doesn't have a decent text editor
[00:17:57] <riv> emacs is actually quite harmful to your hands
[00:18:09] <riv> you have to change it to not physically damage yourself
[00:18:16] <Brekkjern> Like Vim?
[00:18:21] <riv> i dont know, never used vim

[00:25:08] <Brekkjern> WTF?
[00:25:15] <edm> i think most vimmers co-opt vi culture
[00:25:32] <edm> ie i don't think they are making a statement about vim as opposed to vi
[00:26:02] <edm> from a culture wars perspective, vim=vi
[00:26:49] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: the real wtf is blaming the 80 char lines on vim of all things
[00:26:54] <edm> this is IME anyway
[00:27:01] <ngoldbaum> and not convention and people’s terminal windows
[00:27:18] <Brekkjern> I use vi or nano when I need to modify something on a server. vi is shit. nano is shit, but easier to use. emacs is probably not installed. VSCode doesn't have a desktop to render to, so that's also out.
[00:28:00] <Brekkjern> ngoldbaum: Well, I was thinking more about the reply that thinks this is a slam dunk response: "If I want to rewrap something, I can pipe it though fmt(1), or par(1), being plain text and all."
[00:28:33] <Brekkjern> >fmt : The term 'fmt' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
[00:28:33] <Brekkjern> >par : The term 'par' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.
[00:28:33] <Brekkjern> >Such universal...
[00:29:12] <imode> what shell is that.
[00:29:17] <Brekkjern> PowerShell
[00:29:18] <imode> fmt is a part of coreutils.
[00:29:20] <edm> i only drag my erm winder to block out more of twitter in the firefox window behind
[00:29:32] <imode> yeah.. I'm not surprised powershell doesn't have that.
[00:29:34] <imode> :P
[00:29:56] <edm> vim window*
[00:30:24] <Brekkjern> imode: Well, I could run PowerShell on Linux and have them, so it's not so much the shell that's the issue.
[00:30:31] <Brekkjern> But what you asked was what shell it was :P
[00:30:42] <imode> ...powershell on linux?
[00:30:44] <imode> what monstrosity.
[00:30:44] <Brekkjern> Yes
[00:30:50] <imode> that isn't possible, is it?
[00:30:53] <Brekkjern> It is
[00:30:59] <Brekkjern> It runs on Mac too
[00:31:06] <imode> TIL.
[00:31:39] <imode> it still stands, though, that PowerShell is usually associated with MS and therefore Windows, soooooo the fact that you're on windows would explain why fmt isn't a part of your command lexicon.

[00:31:57] <Brekkjern> imode: It's a binary. It's not part of a shell.
[00:32:11] <imode> right, it's a part of coreutils on my system.
[00:32:19] <imode> you don't have /usr/bin in your path...?
[00:32:47] <Brekkjern> I do on my Debian WSL install
[00:32:52] <imode> don't try to criticise the standard availability of something when you're far from standard lmao.
[00:33:08] <Brekkjern> And fmt works in PowerShell on my WSL install
[00:33:17] <imode> \o/
[00:33:19] <Brekkjern> It's just a program that you run. There's nothing special about it.
[00:33:31] <imode> since when did I say that it wasn't.
[00:33:43] <Brekkjern> I bet I could even pipe a stringified objet into it and fmt would mangle it completely
[00:33:44] <imode> or that there was something special.
[00:33:54] <imode> try piping C code, it mangled it lmao.
[00:33:55] <riv> Brekkjern: lol

[00:34:25] <Brekkjern> So yeah. Not that great.
[00:34:33] <imode> I mean, you have to understand what it's used for.
[00:34:48] <Brekkjern> Of course. I didn't expect it to output anything useable :P
[00:34:50] <imode> it's meant to be used with paragraph-oriented text.
[00:35:03] <imode> ...for some definition of paragraph.
[00:35:23] <imode> it absolutely mangles C code.
[00:35:32] <riv> hahaha
[00:41:28] <Brekkjern> imode: If it wasn't clear from the output of Get-Command, it's kinda like which or command -v, but it outputs an object with some more details than what those utils give.
[00:41:58] <Brekkjern> So it searches the current path, aliases, and all loaded modules.
[00:42:55] <imode> neat.
[00:43:33] <Brekkjern> Also, if you don't specify a command, it lists everything in the current search scope

[01:05:24] <dimadima> the thing that puzzles me most about that comment about hardwraps the "I don’t even use monospace fonts,"
[01:05:32] <dimadima> wtf
[01:05:53] <dimadima> how do you program w/o columns
[01:07:02] <ngoldbaum> with difficulty
[01:07:05] <ngoldbaum> in java
[01:07:05] <Brekkjern> Do you really need columns?
[01:07:17] <ngoldbaum> Brekkjern: depends on how mathy your code is
[01:07:26] <Brekkjern> Like, I don't think it would make much of a difference for me.
[01:07:31] <ngoldbaum> if it’s very mathy aligning columns can make it way easier to read
[01:08:18] <dimadima> i use that visual check all the time to the point that it's subconscious
[01:08:32] <imode> I have to use a monospace font because if I don't I cry.
[01:09:09] <dimadima> i just tried setting my terminal font to a varaible width font and it was still monospaced
[01:09:22] <dimadima> the glyphs just occupied fractions of fix-width boxes
[01:09:36] <dimadima> it looked crazy
[01:09:46] <dimadima> maybe you can turn that off somehow
[01:10:02] <dimadima> i used to investiage shit like this but i've gotten to the point where i just don't care anymore

[03:56:50] <defect> god damn it google... i went back to sweden for about a week a few months ago and they still think i'm in sweden
[03:57:09] <cb_> look at lovely møøse
[03:57:26] <defect> so i get swedish ads on youtube etc. fine by me, but i don't think the advertisers are getting the ROI on me they want when swedish grocery stores advertise
[03:57:39] <defect> and now youtube tv won't work because it's "not available in this country"
[03:57:56] <defect> despite me having a US credit card, US location set, and a US IP...
[03:59:13] <dimadima> one time, out of nowhere, google decided i was plish
[03:59:15] <dimadima> polish*
[03:59:35] <dimadima> and, get this, took my russian name, and polish-ized it
[03:59:54] <dimadima> after a day, it went back to being spelled in russian
[03:59:58] <dimadima> mind you, i didn't go to poland or anything
[04:00:01] <dimadima> i didn't go anywhere
[04:00:26] <defect> maybe some intern launched their project :P
[04:00:50] <dimadima> hahaha maybe
[04:01:04] <dimadima> and maybe my name _is_ polish, but in english i spell it the russian way
[04:01:17] <dimadima> -ovsky instead of -owski
[04:01:37] <dimadima> it was so weird
[04:01:50] <dimadima> so what are you going to do, defect
[04:01:50] <defect> having an non-US name is a pain
[04:02:12] <defect> i have three names in sweden, but i only go by one of them
[04:02:21] <defect> but in the US i'm always some combination of them
[04:02:48] <defect> not sure.. i don't care that much about the ads being targeted wrong, but i am paying for youtube tv
[04:02:57] <defect> i think they actually have some kind of support chat
[04:03:58] <defect> tried to move an IRA from betterment to fidelity but couldn't because my name(s) is different between the two :/
[04:27:46] <dimadima> so in sweden people do like three "first names" + a last name?
[04:30:47] <companion_cube> some do in France too!
[04:32:17] <dimadima> i thought that was a catholic thing?
[04:32:37] <dimadima> historically?
[04:32:45] <dimadima> but i guess it's not?
[04:34:56] <companion_cube> I have no idea
[04:36:27] <dimadima> your french companion_cube ?
[04:36:54] <companion_cube> yep
[04:37:01] <dimadima> you guys invented revolution
[04:37:23] <dimadima> and lots of math :)
[04:37:49] <dimadima> what do people in france think of the french revolution these days?
[04:37:54] <companion_cube> french revolution was inspired from US independence, though! :D
[04:37:59] <companion_cube> well, we're proud of it
[04:38:23] <companion_cube> but like most revolutions it directly lead to a lot of bloodbath
[04:38:50] <dimadima> it's interesting how the french revolution lead all the way to WWII
[04:39:18] <dimadima> i mean, beyond the banality of all history leading to other history
[04:39:34] <dimadima> the french/austro-german conflict really seems to have started then
[04:40:09] <dimadima> (just speaking of bloodbath, you know)
[04:52:14] <companion_cube> oh well
[04:52:20] <companion_cube> France at war with the rest of Europe, for a change
[04:53:27] <dimadima> oh i didn't mean anything bad by that at all!
[04:53:39] <companion_cube> ahah no worries
[04:53:48] <dimadima> in fact i wanted to joke and say something like "thus, the french are nazis, QED" or something :)
[04:53:51] <companion_cube> I never thought of it in these terms
[04:54:10] <companion_cube> but yeah, I guess it's when Prussia started replacing the UK as the main ennemy? uh
[04:54:29] <dimadima> hehe

[05:00:43] <dimadima> is that big bertha?
[05:00:53] <dimadima> https://i.imgur.com/qYMYEhv.png
[05:01:01] <dimadima> thought big bertha was something else
[05:01:10] <companion_cube> holy shit "big bertha" is only in the Chaplin movie
[05:04:08] <companion_cube> ah wait, not even
[05:04:11] <companion_cube> well
[05:04:13] <companion_cube> TIL
[05:04:26] <companion_cube> I wonder why this is a persistent feature of the germans
[05:04:28] <companion_cube> and no one else

[05:32:23] <imode> pho is one of life's simple pleasures.
[05:35:07] <dimadima> i've never had pho, but soups like that
[05:35:11] <dimadima> they are great
[05:38:32] <imode> there's a place that sells like, two days' worth of pho for like $10.
[05:54:28] <defect> dimadima: number of names in sweden depend. in my family we do one name from moms side, one name from dads side, and then a "new" name that the kid actually goes by
[05:54:41] <defect> but in my passport for instance there is no such thing as middle names
[05:54:49] <defect> just names, and surname(s)
[05:55:16] <defect> which confuses every bank and insurance company in the us
[06:25:34] <dimadima> thats a fun naming system.
[06:25:56] <dimadima> if you could do coming to america over again, would you just use your one name and last name?
[06:26:11] <dimadima> or would that be not possible given what's on your passport?
[06:28:07] <dimadima> imode: i've only had vietnamese food once but it was incredible. it was in the seattle area somewhere actually, wish i remembered the place
[06:28:45] <imode> if you're ever out west, hit me up man.
[06:28:45] <dimadima> a friend who grew up in seattle took me there. it was a small little restaurant and everything was served with all these greens that you used as wraps
[06:29:06] <imode> ahhhh basil and lettuce wraps?
[06:29:09] <dimadima> or that's how we used them
[06:29:10] <dimadima> yes
[06:29:13] <imode> those are aewsome.
[06:29:15] <imode> *awesome.
[06:29:16] <dimadima> so much basil
[06:29:23] <dimadima> i will hit you up
[06:29:35] <dimadima> it was this wonderful mix of fresh greens and spicey flavor
[06:30:06] <defect> dimadima: i've been thinking of changing my name over here, but i suspect it'll just cause more confusion if my swedish passport doesn't match
[06:30:14] <imode> I really wanna start making that stuff at home but I don't have the time!
[06:31:17] <defect> bahn-mi sandwiches are usually really good too, and i think vietnamese in origin?
[06:34:16] <dimadima> yeah that might happen defect. that happened to my mom. russian women's lastnames are "feminized", so if your lastname is "borisov" then for a women it would be "borisova"
[06:34:43] <dimadima> so her last name was slightly different from ours when we came cause that's what was on her soviet papers
[06:34:47] <defect> ah right
[06:34:51] <dimadima> which caused all kinds of confusion
[06:35:01] <dimadima> and then she changed it to ours and that caused all kinds of confusion
[06:35:06] <dimadima> it's confusion all the way down
[06:35:29] <defect> if i try to get naturalized i'll think harder about it
[06:35:33] <dimadima> i guess it stabilized after a few years
[06:35:40] <dimadima> yeah
[06:35:47] <dimadima> when did you come to the states
[06:36:04] <defect> not letting go of that swedish citizenship easily though :P
[06:36:04] <dimadima> or, uh, you been here a while?
[06:36:13] <dimadima> do you have to??!
[06:36:15] <defect> bit over five years
[06:36:15] <defect> no
[06:36:22] <dimadima> oh yeah nice
[06:36:30] <defect> both sweden and the us allow dual citizenships afaik
[06:36:33] <dimadima> what do you think of america

[06:37:02] <defect> i mean, there is a lot of fucked up stuff. but i still enjoy living and working in new york

[06:40:29] <dimadima> yeah the united states has its pros and cons. i'm not totally down on it like many people
[06:40:34] <defect> i pay less taxes than in sweden, but not a lot tbh
[06:40:37] <dimadima> but i like to think i'm realistic about it
[06:40:48] <dimadima> you really pay less taxes in sweden even if you earn as much?
[06:41:10] <dimadima> that's surprising. the trope here is the EU is all tax tax tax
[06:41:18] <defect> no, i paid more taxes in sweden. but not as much more as i thought
[06:41:23] <dimadima> ah
[06:41:31] <dimadima> oh i misread that my bad
[06:41:45] <dimadima> yes the taxes after 100k here get pretty substantial
[06:42:13] <dimadima> it's pretty fun to travel around the states i think. the country is huge
[06:42:30] <defect> oh yeah
[06:42:33] <dimadima> kind of homogeneous in many ways, but very diverse in others
[06:42:45] <defect> the first time i went to california with my family, we had a connecting flight in boston
[06:42:52] <companion_cube> what's homogeneous is the same franchises in suburbs everywhere
[06:42:53] <defect> and we were like, "ah finally in the us"
[06:42:58] <companion_cube> snow crash was right
[06:42:59] <defect> and then 6 more hours
[06:43:19] <dimadima> hahaha yes it's sooo long to CA :(
[06:43:21] <dimadima> i hate that
[06:43:36] <dimadima> people go to hawaii on vacation and i think they are crazy
[06:43:48] <dimadima> i can't fly that far, not even for hawaii
[06:43:51] <defect> yeah, haven't been there yet
[06:43:55] <dimadima> me neither lol
[06:43:59] <dimadima> can't fly that far
[06:44:05] <dimadima> for, like, a nice beach
[06:44:15] <dimadima> but people do it
[06:44:20] <defect> yeah
[06:44:39] <dimadima> companion_cube: what about snow crash
[06:44:39] <defect> i'd have to stay for at least two weeks i think
[06:44:44] <defect> otherwise it's not worth it
[06:44:45] <dimadima> yeah at least
[06:44:54] <dimadima> and i'd get bored and anxious after 1 :)
[06:44:57] <defect> hehe
[06:45:32] <defect> before covid i did try to travel around a bit on the east coast though
[06:45:49] <defect> three hour flight down to savannah for the weekend, why not?
[06:46:08] <dimadima> oh savannah is really interesting
[06:46:10] <dimadima> charleston too
[06:46:16] <defect> i loved charleston
[06:46:38] <dimadima> yeah it's really nice
[06:46:46] <dimadima> neat places
[06:47:14] <dimadima> i went to maine/new hampshire for the first time 3-4 year sago
[06:47:18] <defect> ah ncie
[06:47:20] <dimadima> all really nice
[06:47:26] <imode> if you go back take me with you.
[06:47:28] <defect> been eyeing maine for a bit, but haven't gone
[06:47:28] <imode> lmao.
[06:47:44] <dimadima> imode: :)))
[06:47:45] <defect> where in maine did you go?
[06:48:10] <imode> grew up in maine for 20 years before moving, I can show you some shit.
[06:48:14] <companion_cube> dimadima: the exageration about franchises is still kind of spot on
[06:48:18] <companion_cube> it's frightening
[06:48:25] <companion_cube> you can cross the country and still eat the same generic stuff
[06:48:32] <imode> the easternmost city of the united states has some fun stuff happen in the summer.
[06:48:44] <companion_cube> defect: where are you based?
[06:48:48] <defect> companion_cube: new york
[06:49:57] <companion_cube> ah nice
[06:49:59] <Church> Went up to Ithaca, NY this last week
[06:50:03] <Church> Nice place
[06:50:06] <defect> upstate NY can be really nice
[06:50:07] <Church> Gorgeous scenery
[06:50:13] <Church> All the inclined killed me though.
[06:50:41] <Church> Thank you gorgeous trail for being nothing but uphill you fucker! And slick! I almost fell into a waterfall... again!
[06:50:51] <imode> the hills are alive with the sound of chafed thighs
[06:51:13] <defect> and confused cruise control
[06:51:46] <dimadima> defect: nowhere in particular in maine. we stayed in on a lake (a "pond"?) by a town called vassalboro for a few days, then we checked out some rich places on the coast like ogonquit that were nice in their own way
[06:51:47] <defect> finger lakes in upstate ny is really nice. bunch of nice breweries and things
[06:51:52] <defect> nice
[06:52:04] <imode> come up by bah habah and we'll treat ya right bub
[06:52:07] <dimadima> yeah ppl love finger lakes. i've not been but they are happening apparently
[06:52:35] <dimadima> imode: we got as far as belfast driving up the coast :)
[06:52:38] <dimadima> it was all really nice
[06:52:49] <imode> aha! that's a lovely area.
[06:52:53] <dimadima> what blew my mind in the united states w/ the south west
[06:53:15] <Church> defect: Yeah the finger lakes was nice. Had a waterfall in the backyard of our rental
[06:53:46] <defect> Church: that's pretty awesome
[06:53:52] <dimadima> i've got to process my CR2 from that trip and put up a photoblog
[06:54:09] <dimadima> Church: damn

[06:55:27] <dimadima> oh nice, LI <3
[06:55:41] <dimadima> defect: yeah, in my mind it's southern california east of LA/SD
[06:55:53] <dimadima> nevada, arizona, new mexico, etc
[06:56:12] <defect> gotcha
[06:56:19] <dimadima> mostly poor to the point of being depressing, but remarkable in so many ways
[06:56:45] <defect> i don't have a license so most of my travels have been to cities
[06:56:56] <defect> i should get one and drive around
[06:56:56] <dimadima> i drove through there with friend during college. one night we stayed at motel on a reservation
[06:57:13] <dimadima> oh yeah driving is america :)

[07:06:21] <defect> i had this romantic idea of a US roadtrip, but then i went austin to nyc straight with two friends
[07:06:40] <defect> a dark highway at 4 am in like kentucky isn't super interesting
[07:06:51] <defect> should get my license and do a proper road trip
[07:18:45] <companion_cube> straight, as in, without stops?
[07:28:58] <defect> companion_cube: stops at gas stations and fast food places, but no stopping for sleep
[07:29:17] <defect> or seeing stuff along the way
[07:30:28] <companion_cube> that sounds horrific
[07:30:38] <companion_cube> with 3 drivers I guess it can be done, but damn :D
[07:31:50] <defect> well, two drivers since i don't have a license :P
[07:32:05] <defect> but i kept morale up!
[07:39:32] <companion_cube> how long did it take?
[07:53:48] <dimadima> al-fucking-right
[07:54:02] <dimadima> all, even
[07:54:06] <dimadima> defect: that sounds terrible lol
[07:54:07] <companion_cube> alt-fucking-right?

[07:54:45] <dimadima> they do that sort of thing in on the road, but with, like, tons of drugs
[07:55:13] <dimadima> "benzedrine" aka meth :)
[07:55:26] <dimadima> good evening indigo !
[07:55:43] <defect> companion_cube: 32 hours
[07:56:06] <dimadima> 32 hours straight, damn
[07:56:16] <dimadima> why did you decide to do it? sheer romanticism?
[07:56:49] <companion_cube> impressive y'all even survived
[07:57:05] <defect> No, i was visiting just visiting austin but one of them were moving back to nyc after like six years
[07:57:24] <defect> so we filled a van with all his stuff, his dog and ourselves
[07:57:39] <defect> i had plane tickets back but thought a roadtrip sounded kinda fun :P
[07:58:55] <dimadima> well at least you did it :)
[07:59:26] <dimadima> that's an accomplishment in its own right
[07:59:36] <dimadima> but then ahaha your friend had to unpack!
[07:59:55] <dimadima> well, even better, then your friend had to find parking
[07:59:56] <defect> oh yeah
[08:00:03] <dimadima> heheheh brutal
[08:00:10] <defect> we arrived in downtown manhattan at like 3 am on a sunday
[08:00:17] <defect> looking for a parking spot where he was moving to
[08:00:27] <defect> drove around for a long time
[08:00:38] <dimadima> yeah there's not a lot of alt side at 3 am

[19:06:01] <dimadima> making your own CDN is fun tho

[19:10:00] <riv> it is unclear how cloudflare just appeared with their massive resources
[19:12:06] <dimadima> is "investment" an insufficient answer?
[19:12:20] <ngoldbaum> dimadima: they have a very high bar for refusing to provide service to awful people
[19:13:54] <ngoldbaum> e.g. kiwifarms has cloudflare
[19:21:22] <gerikson> ngoldbaum: I'm pretty sure being pro-nuclear is a position espoused by the part of society that's "welp AGW is terrible, it's happening, but there's nothing we can do so YOLO"
[19:22:09] <ngoldbaum> also people who don’t engage with the economics
[19:22:25] <ngoldbaum> solar + wind are *so* much cheaper
[19:23:24] <ngoldbaum> doesn’t matter if it’s prometheus’ fire if accessing it requires massive up-front capital costs, ongoing operations and maintenance costs, and expensive decommissioning and nuclear waste no one knows what to do with
[19:27:27] <gerikson> mmm
[19:27:47] <gerikson> yeah it's great if you don't have to account for the externalities
[19:28:05] <indigo> Oh wow, I didn’t realize nuclear was more expensive
[19:28:50] <indigo> I thought that once a plant gets built it is super cheap because of how much energy it produces
[19:29:34] <ngoldbaum> depends on if you include the regulatory approval, construction, and decommissioning costs
[19:29:59] <ngoldbaum> also a lot of people like to pretend building new plants is cheap but also no one has done it cheaply yet…
[19:30:41] <ngoldbaum> and if you want to use unproven technologies to cut costs, great, but they’re unproven technologies so you need to pay for them first and get them approved
[19:32:25] <gerikson> bbl
[19:33:50] <indigo> I guess that makes sense why so few countries are building new plants these days
[19:41:53] <gerikson> nuclear proponents will just say the industry is "overregulated"
[19:43:02] <wrl> lmfao
[19:43:21] <riv> we nee recreational nuclear power plants and we want it now
[19:47:10] <pja> They’re not /entirely/ wrong. Nuclear waste includes /anything/ from a nuclear plant, most of which is less radioactive than the spoilhead of a coal fired power station.
[19:47:25] <pja> It’s the nasty high grade stuff that’s problematic.
[19:47:31] <pja> (spoilheap)
[19:48:15] <pja> But the early days of nuclear power were marked by a “get this built asap & damn the consequences” attitude, so now we’re living under the inevitable backlash to that,

[22:53:36] <spookymode> there's a difference between "this is economical/not economical to cook for myself" and "cooking is the most mystical thing on the planet and anybody that says otherwise is a fake human".
[22:54:36] <spookymode> these people are so out of touch with the responsibilities tha their lives incur that they think a private chef is an answer to "I have to cook for myself".

[23:01:09] <dimadima> cooking can be reasonably perplexing if you didn't grow up in an environment where that was normal
[23:01:46] <dimadima> i struggle with people trying to optimize everything in their lives, if anything
[23:01:49] <spookymode> 100% agree, and for me it wasn't. those horseshit influencer folks that confuse you about what to make need to gtfo people's feeds.
[23:01:55] <dimadima> like the whole purpose of live is being optimal
[23:02:10] <spookymode> those people have superiority complexes.

[23:03:58] <dimadima> o no that fish
[23:04:09] <spookymode> I don't make pizza because it's economical to order it vs. buying the ingredients and incurring a time cost. I don't make korean fried chicken because buying a fryer and frying is just not something I'm comfortable with.
[23:04:27] <dimadima> this is stressing me out
[23:05:17] <spookymode> but I make some bangin' pot roast. because it's just "brown meat, baste meat (optionally), throw it in a thing and wait".
[23:05:32] <spookymode> same for stuff like noodle dishes.
[23:05:33] <dimadima> i don't even brown that shit
[23:05:39] <dimadima> croocccck pot
[23:05:42] <dimadima> one and done
[23:05:43] <spookymode> yeah if you have a slow cooker it does it for you lol.
[23:06:00] <dimadima> got a whole chicken slowing cooking right now in fact
[23:06:05] <spookymode> I have an instant pot and we're usually hungry quick.
[23:06:07] <spookymode> ooooo.
[23:06:41] <dimadima> roasts are so good
[23:06:47] <spookymode> whatchu got on that bad boy, herbs?
[23:07:05] <Church> If I could if probably live off Soylent
[23:07:07] <dimadima> i grew up thinking roasts were hard casue culturally in every cartoon/show men are complaining about how their wife makes the roast tough
[23:07:15] <dimadima> i guess they didn't have slow cookers
[23:07:36] <spookymode> yeah they had an oven, but I mean, a low temp oven is basically a slow cooker.
[23:07:40] <dimadima> spookymode: nothing! just some potatos/carrots/onions in there with salt/pepper
[23:07:49] <spookymode> lit.
[23:07:52] <dimadima> spookymode: but why would it be tough then?
[23:07:57] * spookymode shrugs.
[23:07:58] <dimadima> it must be hard
[23:08:10] <spookymode> maintaining temperature, maybe? I dunno, I never got that either.
[23:08:16] <dimadima> i've never had a roast come out tough from the slow cooker
[23:08:26] <dimadima> maybe cause in the over it's not soaking in water
[23:08:31] <dimadima> oven*
[23:08:48] <spookymode> favorite thing to do (we did it recently) is to pull the roast out and warm it when we get up.
[23:08:52] <dimadima> Church: but with soylent, there's no way you feel... sated?
[23:08:55] <spookymode> so it's hot 'n ready throughout the day.
[23:09:11] <spookymode> it also keeps cooking it so the thing practically dissolves into shredded beef.

[23:10:08] <dimadima> spookymode: so you have a cooked roast in the crock, that you then put into the slow cooker again hte next day to just warm and cook some more throughout the day?
[23:10:19] *** Joins: fengshaun (~fengshaun@S010680615f0c2c0a.cg.shawcable.net)
[23:10:25] <spookymode> oh I don't have a crock, the instant pot has a warm function that does the slow cooking.
[23:10:34] <dimadima> but that's the diea/
[23:10:36] <dimadima> idea?*
[23:10:38] <spookymode> yeah pretty much lol.
[23:10:42] <dimadima> that's nice
[23:10:43] <spookymode> repeat that for a couple of days.
[23:10:46] <dimadima> lol
[23:10:53] <dimadima> never occured to me
[23:10:54] <spookymode> whole house smells like rosemary, garlic and beef broth.
[23:10:59] <dimadima> i don't think my wife would be down for that
[23:11:16] <dimadima> she doesn't like the "cooked to shit" meat thing, although that's kind of my jam
[23:11:24] <spookymode> oh it's not cooked to shit, it just melts the roast.
[23:11:31] <pja> I always find slow cookers ruin good meat.
[23:11:34] <spookymode> like, more of that connective tissue.
[23:11:38] <dimadima> pja: even roasts?
[23:11:41] <pja> They’re good for the tough stuff though.
[23:11:45] <spookymode> 100%.
[23:11:49] <pja> dimadima: Especially roasts.
[23:12:04] <dimadima> don't meat people not consider roasts "good meat"?
[23:12:06] <pja> If your meat is good enough to roast, it needs roasting (or maybe sous vide).
[23:12:13] <dimadima> i'm not into steaks at all, for example
[23:12:39] <dimadima> by "roast" i mean the part of the cow, not the method of preparation
[23:13:06] <Church> dimadima: With enough I do
[23:13:13] <Church> Also just need to swallow some fat
[23:13:31] <spookymode> my procedure is.. treat the whole roast like a steak, brown the outside, baste that bad bitch with a little butter, add in some rosemary and garlic towards the end, dump veggies into the instant pot, dump the roast into the instant pot, dump your roasting herbs in there along with some beef broth and seasoning, and set it to cook for 45mins under high pressure.
[23:13:42] <spookymode> caramelize onions and dump 'em on top of the roast if you want.
[23:13:49] <pja> If it’s stewing steak that needs hours in a pot, then sure.
[23:13:50] <spookymode> you end up with something between a pot roast and a beef stew.
[23:14:14] <spookymode> and if you keep warming it through like we do every day, it turns into something beautiful.
[23:14:28] <pja> I should try an instant pot.
[23:14:44] <spookymode> you should. it makes a lot of stuff easier.

[23:42:29] <spookymode> turing's philosophy needs to come back.
[23:42:41] <dimadima> does posix claim to "define a full OS"?
[23:43:20] <dimadima> "iso" maybe isomorphic? I don't know what Tree is though
[23:43:42] <dimadima> what's turing's philosophy
[23:44:13] <spookymode> understandable to the average joe.
[23:44:16] <pja> spookymode: “iso to Tree [u8]” is Haskellish for “isomorphic to the Tree datastructure whos branches and leaves are UTF8 strings”
[23:45:05] <spookymode> pja: even then I'd disagree because symbol structure isn't always based on UTF8.
[23:45:06] <skyl4rk> iso[chore][baric[sic?]][therm]
[23:46:00] <pja> i.e. (plus (minus 1 2) 3) is ~= Branch “plus” (Branch “minus” Leaf “1 2”) Leaf “3”
[23:46:04] <gerikson> so we've S-expr which I've always seen as weird lisp ... sex stuff, and haskell
[23:46:04] <pja> or something like that anyway.

[23:46:22] <gerikson> just need APL to reach Nerd Nirvana
[23:46:33] <pja> We just need one more for the trifecta of “I’m more intelligent than you are” language one-upmanship.
[23:46:43] <pja> Yeah. A spot of APL would be perfect.
[23:47:07] <spookymode> no it's "I know more words than you."
[23:47:12] <pja> spookymode: For trad lisps, sure. But you can imagine an s-exp where that was the case.
[23:47:39] <gerikson> ⍣ <- spot of APL
[23:47:51] <pja> I wouldn’t say they were entirely wrong either. s-exps are quite nice to parse after all.
[23:47:58] <spookymode> pja: right, it's a practical concern, but symbol identity could also not correspond to equality between UTF-8 strings.
[23:48:11] <pja> & that’s because they decay into a nice tree structure, which is all they’re really getting at.
[23:48:18] <spookymode> no they're correct, they're just using obscure verbiage to say they're correct.
[23:48:26] <spookymode> which is an asshole move.

[23:49:33] <spookymode> I'll tolerate jargon where it's appropriate, not on public forums.
[23:50:00] <spookymode> wellllllll that's not exactly what I meant.
