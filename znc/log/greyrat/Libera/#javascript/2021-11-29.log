[01:49:17] <ThePhilgrim> Hi, I have a button that triggers foo(). I also have a setInterval that does myButton.click() every 10 seconds. Is there any way for me to let foo() know if the button was triggered from an actual click, or from the interval .click() ?
[01:49:44] <d3x0r> ya keepa  boolean 'is pressed' that you can cler when youwant to allow it again
[01:50:18] <ThePhilgrim> I never want to disable it
[01:50:38] <ThePhilgrim> I just want to know if it's called from a manual click or from an automatic click
[01:50:50] *** Joins: pavonia (~user@user/siracusa)
[01:51:00] <d3x0r> oh - the event should have Event.isTrusted
[01:52:02] <ljharb> !setinterval @ ThePhilgrim
[01:52:02] <jellobot> ThePhilgrim, Avoid setInterval; use setTimeout instead. https://web.archive.org/web/20160602165800/https://zetafleet.com/blog/2010/04/why-i-consider-setinterval-to-be-harmful.html (requestAnimationFrame may be another alternative, see !raf)
[01:52:33] <ljharb> and you don't want to be writing code that depends on isTrusted - why do `.click()` at all on the timeout? just call the handler function directly.
[01:53:29] <d3x0r> right - break out the function body to a common function and call it with 'clicked' or 'notclicked'

[01:54:51] <ThePhilgrim> I can't call the handler function directly, because it depends a lot on the event from the element

[01:55:18] <phantomotap> how so?
[01:56:05] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: sure you can, because the timeout/interval is calling it "directly" already
[01:56:26] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: iow you already don't need anything that comes from it being an actual event handler - you just need the right event object
[01:56:30] <ThePhilgrim> I'm doing setInterval -> myElement.click()
[01:57:24] <ThePhilgrim> Here's the code
[01:57:24] <ThePhilgrim> https://dpaste.com/FQM37ZKZB
[01:57:30] <ThePhilgrim> it's a slider
[01:57:44] *** Joins: doc (~doc@user/doc)
[01:57:44] <ThePhilgrim> I'm trying to make it change the visible element every 5 sec
[01:58:14] <ThePhilgrim> But if the user clicks left or right arrow, I want the interval to stop for 5 seconds, and then continue again
[02:00:26] <ThePhilgrim> isTrusted would really be the perfect solution for me here
[02:00:31] <ThePhilgrim> No bueno?
[02:00:38] <d3x0r> sounds like a boolean ... when clickced set clicked' when the next timer fires, skip it and clear the bool
[02:00:47] <d3x0r> it's standard now
[02:01:06] <d3x0r> that isTrusted; if it was a few years ago it was still being implemented
[02:01:22] <ThePhilgrim> Why is it not okay any more?
[02:01:35] <ThePhilgrim> Seems like a great thing to use :S
[02:01:57] <d3x0r> itnot not 'anymore' it's in the 'beforefore times
[02:02:19] <ThePhilgrim> Is it a big no no to use it nowadays?
[02:02:24] <d3x0r> no
[02:02:30] <d3x0r> it is to use it yesterday
[02:02:39] <ThePhilgrim> Ah
[02:02:42] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: never use setinterval.
[02:02:46] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: see the article i linked you above.
[02:02:49] <ThePhilgrim> ljharb: I read it
[02:02:52] *** Quits: GuiToris (~GuiToris@user/guitoris) (Quit: Sieben Acht Gute Nacht!)
[02:02:52] <ljharb> ok
[02:03:14] <ljharb> isTrusted is a new thing, and it's not clean to rely on its semantics for "did i manually call this or not"
[02:03:15] <ThePhilgrim> But I wouldn't know how to do it with setTimeout tbh
[02:03:38] <ThePhilgrim> So what is isTrusted used for?
[02:03:59] <d3x0r> to know if it came from a button - but if you're generating Event messages and calling functions willynilly it doesn't mean anything
[02:04:09] <d3x0r> (not that you, or generally most people do that)
[02:05:01] <ThePhilgrim> I think it's perfect for my situation (if I was to use setInterval that is). "If it's called from the interval, continue; if it is clicked, execute X"
[02:06:19] <d3x0r> if you did use setTimeout instead, when you get the click, you can clearTimeout() and set a new setTimeout for 5 more seconds
[02:06:35] <d3x0r> (if you also save the result of the settimeout so you can clear it)
[02:07:08] <ThePhilgrim> ah.. so like let foo = setTimeout if event.isTruested -> clearTimeout(foo) ?
[02:07:18] <d3x0r> and setTimeout ya
[02:07:23] <ThePhilgrim> got it
[02:07:30] <ThePhilgrim> will try and then link code
[02:07:32] <ThePhilgrim> Thanks
[02:08:51] <ljharb> ThePhilgrim: either way it's very bad code to be manually calling event handlers.
[02:08:54] <ThePhilgrim> and if I do cleartimeout(foo) and there is no foo?
[02:09:11] <ThePhilgrim> ljharb: so how would you do it then?
[02:09:35] <d3x0r> if( foo ) cleartTimeout(foo)

[07:25:56] <lantech19446> it's a huge udemy course that's supposed to take you from absolute beginner to "expert" by the end of it. Obviously i don't think i'll be  an expert after 55.5hrs of learning js but it seemed like a good course and covers node too

[07:26:31] <systemfault> And start doing interesting things
[07:26:56] <m_antis> and getting paid YUGE BUCKS like systemfault

[07:27:43] <lantech19446> my end goal is devops but I figured that if I know js and node I can do webdev or even just programming should my desires change
[07:27:44] <systemfault> But I'm certainly paid a lot more than the "average salary" in Canada
[07:28:28] <systemfault> lantech19446: Sure... but if your end goal is devops, you may be focusing on the wrong tech stack.
[07:29:07] <systemfault> Devops are more like... Python, Go... and they're into things like containers and k8s..
[07:29:42] <systemfault> Don't misunderstand me... every dev can benefit of knowing some JS.
[07:30:33] <tempest> bash is also pretty useful for devops
[07:30:37] <lantech19446> node.js was one of the languages recommended on roadmap.sh for devops but i plan to learn python too and I have an entire obsidian document where i'm compiling things I need to know lol
[07:31:20] <lantech19446> the course if any of you are interested in checking it out is JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2022 (Beginner + Advanced) the teachers last name is schwarzmuller and i think i've heard from people that he does other stuff as well and is pretty well recommended

[07:51:01] <hax> I'd suggest bash, python, docker, vagrant, and AWS/GC if you want to do devops.
[07:51:58] <lantech19446> vagrant is the only one that's not in my obsidian document, I forgot to put chef and vagrant in
[07:53:02] <hax> learn linux really well
[07:53:44] <tempest> Powershell is also used a fair bit in Azure devops stuff if you've got some free space
[07:54:01] <lantech19446> yep, currently using rhel on my daily driver and my web server

[07:54:32] <hax> maybe 50

[08:05:51] <tempest> Ah yeah that should be pretty simple - I'd probably start with the official PHP images and customize it from there

[08:07:43] <lantech19446> cool
[08:08:25] <hax> systemfault, maybe they care less about the sales than they used to, but they sure as heck care about maintaining control of the platform that all of their other sales run on
[08:09:47] <hax> why not offer linux versions of office if they don't care? because "linux is a cancer" so they've said, and their own documents outline how to compete with it, not how to live in peace with it
[08:11:29] <systemfault> They're slowly pushing office to the web... so it can be used from anything.
[08:11:34] <hax> it's older, but you can see their plan as early as the halloween docs like 20 years ago
[08:11:54] <systemfault> The macos version of office is getting pretty old now.. (2016 I believe)
[08:12:59] <systemfault> I can totally understand people remembering the MS of the 90s... I still remember myself...

[10:33:48] <ljharb> that apple thing only applies if you use iCloud, store pictures in it, AND share them with others via icloud
[10:33:59] <ljharb> if you never use iCloud photo sharing they don't scan anything
[10:34:39] <ljharb> i've used icloud for probably over a decade and i think only once i've used icloud photo sharing, so i don't think it's really that big a deal

[10:36:41] <paulcarroty> this crap isn't acceptable for me by design, so moving away is logical
[10:37:09] <ashnur> paulcarroty, so you don't use any online storage facilities? just your own machines, your own network?
[10:37:24] <ashnur> or there is some level of compromise you accept in order to work with other people?

[10:38:44] <ashnur> sounds good, if you can do it, for me it's too much work and not enough gain, i just get a shittier version of everything and i have to pay much more for it

[10:42:33] <paulcarroty> hosting is cheap nowadays, yep
[10:43:33] <hax> owncloud gives you a dropbox style sync with some other features as well. it can run on an inexpensive server for a bunch of users too, much cheaper than each person having a cheap account.

[10:44:37] <EdFletcher> is your time cheap? self-hosting means self-administration

[11:07:28] <ljharb> huh? no
[11:07:47] <ljharb> anyone on my network tho is inside my house, and has physical access to it, which means there's *nothing* to stop them from breaking into anything
[11:08:07] <Maxdamantus> Does your house not have WiFi?
[11:09:05] <ljharb> sure. but its range doesn't extend outside my camera-covered property
[11:09:33] <ljharb> but yes, if you're on my wifi network, and have enough PS3s chained together, you could hack into my laptop, sure
[11:09:46] <ljharb> if you can pull that off you deserve it :-)

[11:10:56] <ljharb> but sure

[11:11:32] <Maxdamantus> locks and cameras also don't prevent people from breaking in and stealing your property or information, but like encryption, it makes it much harder and therefore much less likely to happen.

[20:06:00] <cthulchu> my wonderful folks! The front-end library size. Does it only influence the load time? not the performance? If I introduce a class that would have one method, or a million of methods, it won't hinder the performance?
[20:06:17] <cthulchu> I mean CPU-wise.
[20:06:23] <ljharb> cthulchu: it influences everything. But also, performance is the least important thing

[20:06:41] <cthulchu> I'm looking for reasons why jquery should be avoided
[20:06:48] <cthulchu> one of the popular reasons is the file size

[20:06:56] <cthulchu> ahahah

[20:07:09] <cthulchu> ah
[20:07:11] <cthulchu> I see
[20:07:11] <ljharb> cthulchu: that’s a silly argument then
[20:07:26] <ljharb> because react is pure js
[20:07:40] <cthulchu> ah, right

[20:09:09] <ljharb> anyways to justify not using a library to handle dom interaction you have to jump through a lot of hoops. There’s older browsers and tons of browser bugs that libraries abstract over.

[20:09:50] <ljharb> almost always will be.
[20:10:16] <ljharb> using builtin things instead of libraries is good, but most of the web’s builtin things are particularly bad

[20:32:44] <saltrocklamp[m]> are there any javascript refactoring tools that can take into account a graphql schema? e.g. if i change a type in a schema, i also want to change the corresponding type in queries made by various clients in the same monorepo

[20:32:57] <saltrocklamp[m]> in my case, specifically apollo-server and apollo-client

[20:35:01] <feoh> cool
[20:35:24] <ljharb> saltrocklamp[m]: there's no types in javascript
[20:35:25] <pizza> qswz: equnisu ocha!
[20:35:55] <saltrocklamp[m]> ljharb: indeed, it would have to be a best-effort thing that operates on `gql` literals
[20:36:25] <ljharb> not everyone uses the template tag, so i'm not sure if someone's made a tool like that
[20:36:59] <saltrocklamp[m]> fair, although i generally wouldn't expect a tool to read minds and work magic
[20:37:08] <saltrocklamp[m]> that said, is there anything like that specifically for typescript?
[20:37:56] <powftw> Is it possible to remove white spaces at the starting of text inside a textarea? Sometimes, a line in textarea starts at nearly half of the screen. Can we delete the spaces BEFORE THE STARTING of a line? Don't need to do anything with end of the line..

[20:54:40] <ljharb> saltrocklamp[m]: the bloat comment was about the IDEs, not the feature (altho automatic refactoring almost never pays off, since it still requires human review)
[20:55:53] <saltrocklamp[m]> the issue in this case is not that i want the machine to do all the work for me, but that i need try and reduce the chance of missing where a certain query is used
[20:56:23] <saltrocklamp[m]> obviously end-to-end cross-microservice testing would help in this situation, but i'm sure you can imagine how unlikely that is to ever actually happen at most organizations
[20:57:14] <ljharb> isn't that something typescript would catch?
[20:57:22] <saltrocklamp[m]> i would hope so!
[20:57:28] <saltrocklamp[m]> it depends on the api though
[20:57:45] <saltrocklamp[m]> i don't know much about typescript, my org is still evaluating it and we don't have anyone in house that's a real expert
[20:57:56] <feoh> My point was that I don't think so
[20:58:01] <saltrocklamp[m]> you can't really have well-typed stringly-typed api unless you have compile time calcluation of course
[20:58:11] <feoh> Because there's no way for even Typescript to understand the relationship between the code and the GraphQL
[20:58:21] <saltrocklamp[m]> so the typescript interface would have to be something more structured than a gql template literal

[21:38:56] <han-solo> saltrocklamp[m]: mm. Yeah, i never looked much into graphql as REST pretty much still works great for us
[21:39:27] <saltrocklamp[m]> graphql is great for making queries that pull together data from several different sources and only need certain fields from each one
[21:39:45] <saltrocklamp[m]> e.g. if you have 5 different "backend" data sources, the client just has to make 1 request to graphql, and the graphql resolver can figure out where to get the data from
[21:40:08] <saltrocklamp[m]> meaning a lot fewer requests made by the client's browser and a lot less code to send to the client in the first case
[21:40:32] <saltrocklamp[m]> more polite to clients and greater centralization around a "single source of truth"  / unified layer over what might be a mess of data sources
[21:40:49] <qswz> stil overkill
[21:41:06] <saltrocklamp[m]> i would say that depends a lot on your setup
[21:41:22] <qswz> if you have 2 backend for example, you modularize your code, and use Promise.all if you care about perf
[21:41:34] <saltrocklamp[m]> the alternative to graphql is a hand-crafted server that does all that stuff anyway, and exposes specific purpose-built endpoints
[21:41:52] <saltrocklamp[m]> i think that's a trivialization and oversimplification
[21:43:20] *** Quits: ThePhilgrim (~ThePhilgr@151.41.185.44) (Quit: ThePhilgrim)
[21:43:55] <saltrocklamp[m]> so if you are serving a "data-heavy" application where the client might be requesting a wide variety of pieces of data and you can't anticipate all requests, graphql helps turn a NxM problem to a N+M problem
[21:44:16] <saltrocklamp[m]> in addition to decoupling implementation details between data sources and clients
[21:44:38] <qswz> perf is most of the time the last of problems, above all for SPAs
[21:44:43] <saltrocklamp[m]> like i said, the actual hands-on experience is not quite so straightforward. but the promise is valid for sure
[21:45:03] <qswz> you can easily cache using rest (things like react-query)
[21:45:19] <saltrocklamp[m]> indeed, performance is not the main reason i like it (although i believe it is used at facebook to heavily reduce data sent over the wire, where it does matter a lot)

[21:45:48] <saltrocklamp[m]> as well as agreeing on a unified interface and single source of truth
[21:46:02] <saltrocklamp[m]> those are significant benefits in my organization at least, well worth the pain of using relatively new technology

[21:47:45] <qswz> saltrocklamp[m]: have you used json-schema? (e?g? ajv in node)

[21:48:03] *** Joins: justsomeguy (~justsomeg@user/justsomeguy)
[21:48:27] <saltrocklamp[m]> having a schema alone is only part of the problem. however we do use openapi 3.1 between graphql and our backend data sources
[21:48:28] <qswz> ok
[21:48:29] <feoh> IMO making sweeping generalizations about which tool is fit for purpose without understanding requirements is a mistake.
[21:48:51] <saltrocklamp[m]> so internally here everything is rest + openapi 3.[01], and client-facing is all graphql
[21:49:33] <qswz> I don't want to use openai (again, kinda overkill) just bare json-schemas and ajv for validation (we make some quick express middlewares)

[22:58:28] <hassoon> Deneb: you likely called it before the element got created

[22:58:55] <qswz> nah
[22:59:11] <qswz> just defer attribute
[22:59:19] <minall> Yeah, normally I would call crypto.somefunction andi t would be easy, but that will tell me that crypto isn't defiend
[22:59:26] <minall> So I need to have a valid function
[22:59:31] <minall> But let me test it
[23:00:01] <qswz> minall: again I'm telling you subtle crypto is avail in your browser

[23:00:18] *** Quits: mei (~mei@user/mei) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:01:02] <minall> It means it is available natively right?... Let me do the test
[23:01:13] <qswz> it needs to be https page maybe
[23:01:27] <qswz> might be annoying for local dev
[23:02:07] <hassoon> qswz: what ?
[23:02:29] <Deneb> hmm, qswz and hassoon, you might be right. I have a static HTML page on which the object is defined. The JavaScript is a class, the instance of which gets created when the page loads. The JavaScript snippet calling the class is placed at the top in the header section. I will move it to the end of body of the document to see what happens.
[23:02:33] <hassoon> qswz: did he say his code is in a script tag pointing to an outer ressource
[23:03:21] <Deneb> qswz and hasson, that was it. Thank you.
[23:03:38] <hassoon> Deneb: a god idea would be that you set a mutation observer listener on an ancestor of your to-be-created element, that is already there from the beginning, then once you detect the presence of your element, you act on it
[23:04:12] <hassoon> Deneb: maybe qswz got another idea about the defer attribute thing, i suggest you demand some explanation from him

[23:04:34] <qswz> it's a bit overkill in his situation
[23:05:32] <hassoon> qswz: i'd just use a carefully-written and well optimized MO logic to deal with dynamic DOM operations
[23:05:59] <hassoon> Deneb: qswz: 's defer attribute seems interesting, try it first
[23:06:19] <qswz> hassoon: its problem is different
[23:06:25] <Deneb> ah, I see on MDN that its a method
[23:06:32] <qswz> it's just an order of script or something
[23:06:42] <qswz> no need to overengineer it
[23:06:59] <hassoon> qswz: alright then
[23:07:45] <minall> qswz: crypto is not defined, and cannot import it... This is because that, in the environment I'm in, doesn't use native browser libraries that would be normally available in the browser
[23:08:04] <qswz> minall: window.crpto?
[23:08:07] <qswz> y*

[23:09:00] <minall> Because of the environment I need, that's the reason I need to define the function myself, but I can't find it
[23:13:30] <qswz> what env is it?
