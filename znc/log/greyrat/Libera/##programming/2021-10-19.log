[08:16:22] <PlanckWalk> Yes

[09:35:20] <Matt|home> ja def
[09:35:37] <smallville7123> Matt|home: its the game
[09:36:04] <Matt|home> that sucks.. you'd think if you developed an entire game around being able to code shit.. that you'd make sure you could actually code shit :\
[09:36:16] <smallville7123> Matt|home: writing a compiler and an interpeted language is difficult and bugs are bound to appear when compiling and executing the interpreted language
[09:36:44] <smallville7123> Matt|home: haha :)
[09:36:58] <smallville7123> yea :)
[09:37:12] <Matt|home> i understand.. but the whole premise of the game is 'you can hack anything!' so like, i expect a few bugs.. but not something BASIC like an integer iteration.. my _best guess_ is the screen buffer
[09:37:16] <Matt|home> based off of almost nothing
[09:37:46] <smallville7123> Matt|home: could be
[09:38:11] <smallville7123> you can attempt to print some kind of output to the native console as well as the screen buffer
[09:38:25] <Matt|home> well one cool thing is that it's dead easy to "write" an "operating system" in game (realistically just a menu with different options to do shit), but hey if the game calls it an OS then i can call myself an os developer :p
[09:38:37] <smallville7123> to deteermine if it is the screen buffer that breaks or the interpeted language that breaks

[09:39:22] <Matt|home> ty <3

[19:20:04] <InPhase> pyzozord: Also, a final step of reliable threaded programming is shutdown.  All threads must be responsible for shutting themselves down.  You can do this by passing an exit message, so that it happens on the thread.  If you want to abort processes in progress, you can use atomics to signal this outside of the event loop, where again, the thread process itself is responsible for checking regularly 
[19:20:10] <InPhase> to see if it should stop processing, because all threads self-manage their termination.
[19:21:01] <InPhase> pyzozord: Signal atomics going around the event loop like this are the exception to "don't share mutables".
[19:21:37] <pyzozord> I am thinking of a message queue which is essentially just int of length and preallocated array of say 100 messages. Then each thread can push to that queue at any time by first incrementing the length then saving the message in appropriate slot
[19:21:50] <InPhase> pyzozord: Follow all those steps and threaded programming flows just like non-threaded programming, and is pretty easy to track and provide strong guarantees for.
[19:22:33] <InPhase> pyzozord: An event queue is basically a mutex-guarded queue of function objects with bound parameters.
[19:23:25] <pyzozord> no no, I am talking about solution where two threads can push events at the same time

It's the one place in threaded code where you even need to think about mutexes, if you write it yourself.  You make (or grab) one well-tested component for this, and then the rest just follows the model, and the threaded nature does NOT leak into the higher level logic then.

[19:32:06] <pyzozord> no... https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_PollEvent "you can only call this function in the thread that set the video mode"
[19:32:42] <pyzozord> oh ok https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_PushEvent ""This function is thread-safe, and can be called from other threads safely."
[19:32:56] <InPhase> pyzozord: If you just want theory, there are lots of notes out there on it:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming  and so on.

[21:05:13] <vdamewood> and that one was so old it didn't even support CMake 3.14 which has some features that I consider must-have, so It's dropped.

[22:40:59] <user51> tbh, it doesn't work too well, it requires weird input, and you have to screw in a newline because awk deletes them

[22:45:24] <phao> Hi. I was thinking about if there were other languages sort of like PHP in the sense that they could be conveniently used to write programs that go into text file templates. Any clues on this?

[22:46:53] <vdamewood> There's also ASP.NET, but it doesn't do the in-text embedding like ASP did.
[22:46:56] <phao> Ok. I was looking for something not really web centered though.

[22:49:52] <MrPockets> VB6 i believe
[22:49:53] <GeDaMo> A word processor mailmerge?
[22:50:10] <pyzozord> I mean I think most languages will have a library where you can run a simple program that parses/compiles the template. And the template syntax allows for writing that language inline inside it

[23:09:20] <user51> actually, i think that's a screwup - it might bomb the call stack. probably not for the foreseable future though.
[23:09:26] <pyzozord> is this good?
[23:09:39] <pyzozord> exactly I'm thinking that this never cleans up the call stack
[23:10:12] <user51> i originally wrote it in c, which had lots of gotos, so i avoided the call and it was handled in the same list() function

[23:17:05] <user51> pyzozord: i think the reduce call should be a jump, but other than writing an interperter in awk, nto sure how it could be done
[23:17:30] <pyzozord> what does $f do? what does $ do in awk?

[23:18:22] <user51> pyzozord: $f gives the f'th record, e.g $1, $2, $f

[23:18:47] <pyzozord> or was it fields in the line?
[23:19:24] <user51> $(f++) which they use there gives you the f'th field (not line, my bad) and increments f
[23:20:01] <pyzozord> i think they call lines "records"
[23:20:14] <pyzozord> and words "fields" 
[23:21:07] <user51> yeah, record is the correct term, but by default the record seperator is "\n", so i'm used to calling them lines
[23:21:42] <user51> you can just try it - echo hello world | awk '{print $2, $1}'
[23:22:45] <LiaoTao> Is awk worth learning thoroughly?

[23:25:00] <user51> LiaoTao: bit of a difficult question. i used awk only because other than c and shell, that's what i know.
[23:25:21] <user51> it might be useful to know if you're working on some old systems which wouldn't even have perl
[23:25:47] <LiaoTao> It's just that awk always seems to solve some corner cases where sed et al would have been very awkward
[23:25:49] <user51> gawk has a some nice new features, but i never felt like it was a significant improvement
[23:26:06] <user51> sure, if you're interested, pick up the awk book, it's reasonably short
