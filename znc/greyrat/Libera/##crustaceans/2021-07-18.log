[00:53:38] <quanticle> gerikson: There's also the fact that Unix tools themselves don't hew to the Unix philosophy.
[00:53:56] <quanticle> `find` being the most salient example
[00:54:24] <gerikson> find is the No True Unix Tool
[00:55:41] <quanticle> True, but even things like ls
[00:55:56] <quanticle> Have an incredible number of options, some of which are subsumed by other unix tools
[00:56:13] <quanticle> For example: sorting. Why is ls sorting when `sort` exists?
[00:58:17] <gerikson> heh
[00:58:34] <gerikson> never thought of that
[00:59:47] <quanticle> To be fair, I didn't think of it either until I used PowerShell. PowerShell's equivalent of ls, Get-ChildItem only supports the default alphabetical sort. If you want to sort by anything else, you pipe the list of items into Sort-Object -Property <thing you want to sort on>
[00:59:55] <quanticle> Is it more verbose? Incredibly so.
[01:00:06] <quanticle> But I find it makes a sort of sense that I don't get with Unix tools
[01:00:29] <quanticle> Get-ChildItem | Sort-Object -Property "LastWriteTime" vs. ls -ltr
[01:02:59] <gerikson> can `sort` work on metadata like ctime?
[01:04:19] <Brekkjern> quanticle: True, but you can shorten that by using aliases
[01:04:52] <Brekkjern> ls | sort -P "LastWriteTime"
[01:05:29] <quanticle> gerikson: It can't but that's my point. The comment talks about the failure of the Unix philosophy, but doesn't discuss *why* the Unix philosophy failed. There is an inherent contradiction between "small sharp tools" and "use plain text as a serialization format"
[01:05:37] <Brekkjern> The bonus to this style is that every time I want to sort something, I just use Sort-Object. I don't have to learn each commands way of sorting.
[01:05:52] <quanticle> Yep
[01:07:00] <Brekkjern> And you can also sort on practically any property rather than whatever the command has implemented

[01:45:19] <skyl4rk> iirc that xargs thread mentioned how ls output should never ever ever be parsed, I'd assume that would include sorting I guess
[01:47:05] <quanticle> I kind of object to that usage of "parse" because the problem is specifically that there's no real way to parse without simultaneously interpreting the data. If there were a parser that could break down ls' output into a nice data format with discrete fields, so many things would become easier.

[01:47:15] *** Joins: leon (~leon@user/leon)
[01:50:17] <Brekkjern> The problem of the Unix model is that you aren't actually moving text around. You are moving bytes. The interpretation of those bytes is up to the receiving command, and in the case of xargs you are basically just concatenating some bytes and evaling them.
[01:51:03] <Brekkjern> There is no actual structure to this. Just a stream of bytes that you have to interpret. And you better hope that the receiving command interprets that stream as you expect it to do.
[01:54:01] <Brekkjern> The most annoying thing to deal with in PowerShell is sending actual bytes/straight up text around the pipeline as it's not built around doing it. It's possible, but it's easy to screw something up and you end up with something you didn't expect at the end.
[01:55:58] <skyl4rk> if you fly by hope rather than knowledge you're going to have a bad day sooner or later anyway
[01:56:25] <Brekkjern> Absolutely, but at least I don't have to deal with errant whitespace when piping things around in PowerShell :P
[01:56:33] <skyl4rk> sure
[01:57:53] <skyl4rk> whitespace in filenames is an abomination imnsho though
[01:58:51] <skyl4rk> together with other characters that have special shell interpretations
[02:04:50] <Brekkjern> Yeah, you don't have to think about those for PowerShell either. That's the beauty of structured data :)
[02:04:56] <cb> why can't i name my document "Rob Pike Resumé.pdf"?
[02:05:09] <cb> hell, why do i need a .pdf?
[02:07:20] <skyl4rk> you can, but not on my machine
[02:10:09] <Brekkjern> You need .pdf because nobody was smart enough to add a standard for file type in the first few bytes of the file...
[02:10:14] <Brekkjern> It's a shame really :(
[02:10:41] <Brekkjern> We can't even agree if there should be a BOM as the first two bytes of text files :S
[02:11:37] <skyl4rk> or how to do line breaks
[02:13:20] <Brekkjern> True
[02:15:57] <skyl4rk> if you run a hypothetical futuristic grep on a text file with a BOM, should the output contain a BOM as well?
[02:16:30] <skyl4rk> what if you try to match the BOM? try to match anything but the BOM?
[02:17:49] <Brekkjern> The BOM isn't text. It's there to indicate the byte order.
[02:18:31] <Brekkjern> Passing it along in the the pipeline is a mistake, as the byte order and encoding should be decided by the shell. Not the originating file.
[02:18:56] <Brekkjern> And why would you match the BOM? It's not text, so why try to match it with grep?
[02:55:52] <quanticle> Brekkjern: Except for MacOS
[02:56:12] <quanticle> Which did have a field for filetype (and also file *handler*) in the filesystem
[02:56:45] <quanticle> (And by MacOS, I mean classic MacOS, not OSX and later)
[02:58:23] <Brekkjern> I wish that stuck around :S
[02:58:37] <quanticle> Yeah, that was a really nifty design
[02:59:33] <quanticle> I liked the fact that they thought about file handler as well as file type, so that you could have two files that were of the same type (say, RTF documents) but which had different handlers registered, so the file would open in the program that created it.
[03:06:31] <skyl4rk> if you match the first line in the file you would get the BOM and otherwise not?
[03:08:09] <Brekkjern> The BOM really shouldn't have anything to do with text
[03:08:29] <Brekkjern> The behaviour you talk about is how it works now
[03:10:09] <Brekkjern> The problem here is that "text" is ambiguous as it is now. Nobody can agree with what that means. Does it mean bytes, ASCII, UTF-8, some ISO standard? Nobody knows!
[03:30:50] <hoistbypetard> it felt like a real regression when apple deprecated the separation of type and creator info. though the dual fork files that they used to implement it were kind of a turd and led to some security "gifts" that have kept on giving over the years
[03:31:43] <hoistbypetard> (in the form of the ntfs streams that were implemented to support that when MS was trying to use NT 3.5.1 on the server to encroach on apple's strengths)
[03:35:16] <Brekkjern> NTFS streams aren't really a replacement as they don't follow the file itself
[03:35:59] <Brekkjern> I just wish the first byte indicated how many of the following bytes are the filetype, and then you can go from there
[03:37:15] <Brekkjern> Maybe even do BOM before it?
[03:37:48] <Brekkjern> So 2 bytes BOM, 1 byte file type lenght, x bytes of file type, file content?
[03:38:34] <Brekkjern> That would ensure you could read and understand it on any 8 bit in a byte system that adheres to the spec
[03:39:18] <Brekkjern> Now you just need a way to tell the reading program what text encoding the data is in
[04:35:47] <geoffwozniak> I've come around to the idea that the "stream of bytes" thing is tidy enough that no one really wants to change it because it seems so clean and easy, when it is, in fact, the opposite
[04:35:59] <geoffwozniak> I mean, I love it sometimes. Then I really fucking hate it.
[04:37:01] <geoffwozniak> I would love to see an environment that actually used structured data more. I hazard a guess that's a big reason why Linux desktop environments are always such a huge letdown
[04:37:30] <geoffwozniak> Not that I'm terribly thrilled with Windows or macOS, mind you. I just find them less bad.
[04:38:03] <companion_cube> question is always: structured how
[04:38:09] <companion_cube> and is it tied to a runtime/language
