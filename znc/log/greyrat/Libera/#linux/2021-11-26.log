[00:58:32] <jaggz>  From the wikipedia article: When a process loses its parent, init becomes its new parent. Init periodically executes the wait system call to reap any zombies with init as parent. One of init's responsibilities is reaping orphans and parentless zombies.

[02:25:25] <TheGuestMovie> there's degrees of efficiency with these tools, like some just send an image (which I think X11 does), others an image with changed pixels.

[03:13:37] <kfrench> In the finance world, if you are losing money, you write the numbers with a red pen.  If you are making money, you use the black one.
[03:13:46] <pnbeast> velix, because it's when retail makes enough money to be "in the black", to pull their books into profit-making territory, to "get out of the red".  Definitely *not* red Friday, i.e.
[03:13:55] <kfrench> Black Friday is the mythical day when you go from loss to profit for the year.
[03:14:33] <kfrench> A pen is a utensil used to make markings on paper.  Paper is a thin flattened out hunk of wood.
[03:14:35] <velix> pnbeast: Here, they sell it as "Oh dear, we're making stuff way too cheap for your. We'll lose money because of this".
[03:14:41] * kveroneau has never really though of the true meaning behind it's name.
[03:15:06] <velix> pnbeast: And cheaper prices are normally marked in red color her ;)
[03:15:11] <pnbeast> velix, I'm ill-prepared for real life concerns.  Trivial information about idioms?  No problem.  But not real life.
[03:15:15] <velix> pnbeast: normal price black, discounts red.
[03:15:17] <wigums> The earliest evidence of the phrase Black Friday originated in Philadelphia, dating back to 1961, where it was used by police to describe the heavy pedestrian and vehicular traffic that would occur on the day after Thanksgiving.

[06:47:34] <kveroneau> Exactly.  That's why so many distros exist.
[06:47:55] <kveroneau> Someone was using a distro and though they could do this one thing better/different, and so a new distro is born.
[06:47:59] <MrNobody_0000000> ubuntu is as good as arch for some people

[06:48:12] <Khaytsus> My first Linux was a bootstrapping binary and a ramdisk which landed you in a system you could build more stuff from.  I think it used the local disk for storage, forget.  Itr's impossible to find info on it on the Internet :/
[06:48:23] <Belamos> But probably it is about what we learned in the first place, and what we grew to like
[06:48:28] <[[R]]> kveroneau: no... thats not how a distro is born
[06:48:39] <[[R]]> kveroneau: its when a mommy distro and a daddy distro really love each other

[07:20:56] <EdFletcher> neshpion: ooooh yeah sorry, should've mentioned that lol
[07:20:59] <neshpion> lol
[07:20:59] <kveroneau> IRC is a simple enough protocol which should be able to easily extend beyond my death after my mind is uploaded.  Discord and other nasty protocols, not so much.
[07:21:04] <rascul> nobody here chats about milk and cows
[07:21:13] <neshpion> discord is centralized :v

[07:21:29] <MrNobody_0000000> you're getting off topic
[07:21:32] <EdFletcher> neshpion: a bit node discord community called reacitflux also wrote a discord<->irc bridge that's pretty good, i just wanted to have my own
[07:21:34] <neshpion> i can run my own irc server if i want to, but i can't run my own discord server
[07:21:42] <MrNobody_0000000> true that

[07:22:01] <MrNobody_0000000> cow as in copy on write hahaha

[07:22:31] <sebastorama> rascul: yes .. milk and all of it's forms and densities
[07:22:36] <MrNobody_0000000> milk probably is the name of an underground open source project too
[07:22:38] <Starkad> neshpion in that cases, it a better idea uses Rocket.cat
[07:22:40] <neshpion> rascul: that's like saying an internet forum is centralized -- the point is, i can spin up a web server and use an open source forum software to host my own, and anybody with a web browser can join; you can't do that with a discord "server"

[07:24:49] <tusko> vim is ed for people who are too slow to use ed
[07:24:55] <neshpion> rascul: again i liken the centrality of networks to the centrality of pretty much *any* large online community, you can't just host your own copy of <brand>

[07:50:21] <MinusOne> that makes sense. Also, I just found a document that claims 30% performance overhead on write

[14:38:52] <Sauvin> I don't worry. The problem with going shopping for a particular wheel is that the time it can take to FIND one can far exceed the time it takes to MAKE one.
[14:39:04] <rendar> phogg, but if the NAS machine comes up, it's the workstation machine that must take actions (mount NFS) and not the contrary
[14:39:07] <phogg> linux-ha.org used to be a good resource for this stuff but it seems not to have been updated recently

[14:39:49] *** Joins: Tach (~Tach@user/tach)
[14:39:52] <phogg> rendar: one normally expects the servers to stay up all the time and clients to come and go. If that's not your case then you have to do something else
[14:39:54] <rendar> you do that in the client
[14:40:11] <phogg> rendar: sounds like "workstation joins network and wants to mount NFS when it does" to me
[14:40:19] <phogg> the NFS server never goes anywhere
[14:40:47] <rendar> that's not the design of this network, we have a littler NAS that is not always on
[14:40:53] <rendar> it's the backup NAS, always off
[14:41:05] <phogg> okay, then you have some options
[14:41:21] *** Quits: LiaoTao (~LiaoTao@gateway/tor-sasl/liaotao) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[14:41:31] <phogg> you can create some sort of service discovery mechanism that announces when the service is available on the network and have clients monitor that announce channel
[14:41:41] <phogg> this is probably overkill for a one-off, though
[14:41:41] *** Joins: Penguin666x (~Penguin66@217.138.205.135)
[14:41:47] <rendar> indeed
[14:42:15] <phogg> you can have a monitoring system on the network that discovers when the system is up and then announces it. This is also probably overkill
[14:42:28] <phogg> you can have each client monitor each service itself
[14:42:33] <phogg> the last one is basically your original ping idea
[14:42:41] <Sauvin> Eh, screw it. Thanksgiving Day is over. Let's do some overkilling!
[14:43:09] <rendar> i'd use the ping idea, but i have to ping every 2 minutes for something that is seldom connected
[14:43:36] <phogg> you can get a little more elaborate than just pinging. How many pings in a row is disconnect, how often you ping to check if it is up when it is known down, back off periods, etc, etc
[14:43:51] <Sauvin> Thing about my co-operating processes on different machine was that I considered the data I was trafficking to be of high importance, so the very split second something went off the wire, I'd redirect dataflow to another machine.
[14:43:54] <rendar> it's 2022, almost.. so i expected some advanced option, e.g. some facility to alert when a machine goes up on LAN

[14:46:34] <xiaomiao> Sauvin: I'd use something like haproxy for that, it's very good at detecting which of the possible processes are in an alive state
[14:46:55] <phogg> Sauvin: I wrote a whole suite of bash scripts for doing that kind of thing at a job once. Later found that the heartbeat daemon did basically the same thing and would probably have been less work to set up.
[14:47:00] <xiaomiao> I've done that to do ha/failover for redis, it was wonderfully boring
[14:47:05] <phogg> kind of wish I had kept a copy of those scripts...
[14:47:32] <Sauvin> xiaomiao, if I felt like going shopping, I probably would have investigated that. At the time, I was *teaching* myself a number of things, so I don't regret the possibility of re-invented wheels.

[15:45:57] <Jong> Hello. Is there an easy way to move a file from one folder to another? Currently I run pwd, copy and past that, and then copy and paste the file name, to manually create the full path.  Then I use the cp command. I either have memorized the full path of the directory I want to copy the file to, or I cd to that directory and then run cp full/path/filename .
[15:46:14] <bindi> huh
[15:46:28] <bookworm> Jong: mv
[15:46:36] <Jong> But all that just to copy a file gets annoying after a while, especially when I'm coming from mac finder and windows explorer where I hold down command/ctr and drag a file
[15:46:54] <Jong> s/move/copy
[15:46:55] <bindi> substitute the "." with the full path to the location where you cd to
[15:46:57] <Jong> ah it's the same thing
[15:47:16] <Jong> bindi  you didn't read my entire message...
[15:47:24] <bindi> i did
[15:47:28] <bindi> i dont understand what you are doing
[15:47:29] <Jong> " I either have memorized the full path of the directory I want to copy the file to, or I cd to that directory and then run cp full/path/filename ."
[15:47:30] <koollman> I'm not sure why you copy and paste anything
[15:47:37] *** Quits: egy (egy@tilde.team) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[15:47:57] <bookworm> press the tab key to autocomplete paths
[15:47:58] <bindi> cd some_work_dir, ls (to looksie at the files), cp file /new/dir
[15:48:00] *** Quits: zyeri (zyeri@tilde.team) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[15:48:23] <bindi> yes, you can tabcomp each directory
[15:48:30] <Jong> point is, there are multiple steps for what should be very simple
[15:48:32] <koollman> cp /folder/file /otherfolder/ , using tab to complete as you go
[15:48:35] <koollman> one step
[15:48:53] <Jong> hmm okay
[15:48:59] <bookworm> Jong: just... open up a gui finder like nemo
[15:49:06] <Jong> if I don't remember what's in a directory at all then what?
[15:49:13] <bookworm> ls
[15:49:15] <Jong> I "ls" my way through
[15:49:24] <koollman> tab twice then :)
[15:49:39] <Jong> let me try
[15:49:56] <Jong> oh shitttt tab twice!
[15:50:10] <Jong> that changes everything!
[15:51:37] * wigums tabs 27 times
[15:51:46] <koollman> you could also try mc, some like it. I don't, but I understand it can help a lot for these things

[23:10:03] <Dr_Coke> I had to manually set up xrandr for my monitor for 2560x1440
[23:10:13] <Dr_Coke> in mint at least anyway
[23:10:31] <maret> TJ- yes
[23:10:32] <Dr_Coke> So I hope the new changes will detect my monitor
[23:10:45] <Dr_Coke> better
[23:12:12] <TJ-> maret: unless there's something different/changed in the system's udev rules for LVM, the VG should be activated before the mounts, with a call to "vgchange -ay" - so I'd first check what udev is doing
[23:13:14] <phogg`> Dr_Coke: detection is more about the drivers in X and the kernel than the RANDR version.

[23:13:23] <TJ-> maret: if that is happening automatically, I'd look closely at the system log and the timestamps for when thoe VG and LVs are activated - check if the issue is they happen after the mnt-data.mount job starts
[23:13:25] <phogg`> Dr_Coke: still, newer is generally better
[23:13:40] <Dr_Coke> Yeah let's hope so

[23:22:28] <millido> Hi, I am working on ldap, I have setup nslcd and I can login, both through ssh and locally. I have one annoyance, and that is that I currently have to keep a primary group for each user in ldap as well (primary group that is). Does anyone know if there is some way that I can keep _only_ the "additional" groups in ldap. And have the main one "automatic"
[23:23:05] *** Joins: EdFletcher (~PKD@user/edfletcher)
[23:24:29] <phogg`> TonyStone: try it with a simpler WM (e.g. tm) and see if that works.
[23:24:38] <phogg`> er, TWM I mean
[23:25:17] <phogg`> TonyStone: if it works in a simpler environment then you have established that it can work in principle and only need to worry about how to keep Cinnamon from fighting. If it can't then you can move on to other options.
