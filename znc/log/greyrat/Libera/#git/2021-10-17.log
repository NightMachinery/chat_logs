[07:00:48] <jensen> Isn't etckeeper basically just a wrapper for git with the ability to track metadata like ownership/permissions, which is relevant to scripts in /usr and any files that should have ownerships/permissions preserved? I don't see how it's specific to tracking only configs
[07:01:42] <jensen> You can have scripts in /etc/pacman.d/hooks. How are those different than ones in /usr/local/bin? etckeeper's -d option supports this
[07:05:16] *** Joins: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter)
[07:06:48] <elibrokeit> you can't (or shouldn't) have scripts in there, only ini files with an Exec key referencing a script
[07:07:35] <elibrokeit> also yes, etckeeper is "just a git wrapper" but you can misuse anything intended for one thing by doing something else with it, if you're determined
[07:07:44] <elibrokeit> doesn't make it the right tool for the job
[07:08:36] <elibrokeit> have you considered writing a simple PKGBUILD which installs your scripts to /usr/bin and uploading the resulting package to a custom pacman repo?
[07:10:01] *** Quits: Vonter (~Vonter@user/vonter) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[07:11:25] *** Joins: lgc (~lgc@user/lgc)
[07:12:16] <jensen> Whoops you're right, shouldn't have scripts there. Right now I'm just looking for a way to version control any files (config, scripts, etc.) outside of $HOME with the ability to preserve ownership/permissions. Still don't get what about etckeeper makes it not suitable for tracking files outside of /etc
[07:13:36] <jensen> Currently I'm using git for dotfiles in $HOME so it would be nice to use git elsewhere as well. Besides etckeeper, I came across git-store-meta which is more general purpose. etckeeper does that but provides some nice hooks for package management as well
[07:14:39] <elibrokeit> by hooks for package management, you mean it can check in new config files every time the package manager is run?
[07:14:56] <elibrokeit> I don't quite see the utility of this for things that aren't config :p
[07:15:58] <jensen> "            This is called by apt's DPkg::Post-Invoke hook, or by equivalent hooks of other package managers.  It  commits  changes  made  by  packages  into  the
[07:16:00] <jensen>               repository. (You can also call this by hand after running dpkg by hand.)y
[07:16:06] <jensen> )
[07:16:36] <elibrokeit> yes, that's the thing that checks in new (versions of) config files every time the package manager is run
[07:17:26] <jensen> And I also want to track boot loader config in /boot/loader/entries/*
[07:17:34] <elibrokeit> its intended purpose, and the reason why you would need to do so specifically "changes made by packages", is because, well, *packages* could change *config files*
[07:18:01] <elibrokeit> typically by debian maint scripts and stuff, I suppose...
[07:18:33] <elibrokeit> you want to track boot loader config? Why? This should be write-once and not be constantly changing
[07:20:08] <elibrokeit> also it's highly machine specific, whereas typically etckeeper repos could be installed onto a new machine in order to set up that machine like the old machine. But bootloader entries reference the actual hardware you used
[07:20:38] <jensen> I just want to track everything I've added modified outside of $HOME so I don't have to document these changes in my notes

[14:57:03] <elibrokeit> reactormonk[m]: more details are needed to be sure, but git subtree split is the correct solution if the part you want to extract is a subdirectory of the repo. git reset is (probably) never what you want, and git filter-branch can be fooled into doing what you want assuming what you want is to fork the repo, rather than merge it into an existing repo, which TBH feels unlikely

[20:17:39] <Guest46> This is probably more 'github' related, but overall I'm a bit confused. We have a repository, person 2 forked from this repository, and I also have a fork of the original repository. Now there is an open PR from a branch on person 2's fork, how can I push to that branch or open a PR to that branch? I cannot fork his repository because I already
[20:17:40] <Guest46> have a fork of the original one.
[20:18:03] <Guest46> Anyone ever had this issue before?
[20:19:19] <ikke> Guest46: the other user needs to add you as collaborator on their fork
[20:19:37] <ikke> Guest46: I assume you do not have push permissions on the original project?
[20:19:45] <Guest46> I do have push permission on the original repo.
[20:19:48] <Guest46> Not on his fork though.
[20:20:08] <Guest46> I think maybe he didn't have write access to the original repo and thus he made a fork...
[20:20:09] <ikke> There should be an option on the MR for that
[20:20:18] <ikke> PR*
[20:21:11] <Guest46> Oh I see? Github allows you to checkout a PR with their CLI? didn't know that!

[21:21:02] <elibrokeit> Guest46: in the event that someone opens a PR to a repo you have write access to, you can push to the PR branch by default. However, this has nothing to do with forking, and forking would not help -- instead you add that user's fork as a remote and push directly to that repo :p
