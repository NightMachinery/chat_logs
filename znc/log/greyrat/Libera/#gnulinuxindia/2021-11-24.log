[13:39:25] <_devnull[m]> soo fast
[13:39:41] <Arya[m]1> the /id worked aldready
[13:39:43] <_devnull[m]> /id
[13:39:44] <Arya[m]1> and it synced
[13:39:58] <Arya[m]1> so after i added t2bot
[13:40:04] <_devnull[m]> Arya[m]1: good good
[13:40:05] <Arya[m]1> it fully finished it
[13:40:14] <_devnull[m]> Arya[m]1: noice

[13:40:32] <_devnull[m]> xmpp?
[13:40:39] <Arya[m]1> lol no
[13:40:41] <_devnull[m]> irc?

[13:40:47] <Arya[m]1> _devnull[m]: aldready done
[13:40:54] <_devnull[m]> really?
[13:41:01] <_devnull[m]> send msg
[13:41:06] <Arya[m]1> when u bridge matrix you automatocally bridge things that are bridged to it
[13:41:20] <Arya[m]1> so irc was bridged with matrix for a long time
[13:41:27] <_devnull[m]> Arya[m]1: ohhhhhh
[13:41:36] <Arya[m]1> so irc -> matrix -> tg

[13:43:18] <Arya[m]1> irc has no deleting functionality
[13:43:28] <Arya[m]1> so you can see everything in irc
[13:43:56] <_devnull[m]> ohh thats good that they fixed it in matrix
[13:44:27] <Arya[m]1> _devnull[m]: so even if it gets deleted on matrix, irc..

[17:26:24] <_devnull[m]> what inappropriate with it?
[17:26:27] <_devnull[m]> it was pretty normal to me
[17:26:30] <_devnull[m]> you shouldnt let others judgments affect you
[17:27:38] <klimi[m]> that i have too "girly name and pfp"
[17:27:55] <klimi[m]> _devnull[m]: well it's fine by me, i am not the one who sees the pfp anyway
[17:30:31] <_devnull[m]> klimi[m]: it doesnt matter as long as you dont use your psuedo personality to misuse.
[17:30:59] <_devnull[m]> i used to keep girly name and pfp too
[17:32:06] <_devnull[m]> its not neccessarily mean to address my identity but it can address my interests and status too.
[17:34:43] <klimi[m]> but my name is not girly at all... idk why people say such
[17:34:49] <_devnull[m]> look idc what people think but when i see beauty i dont see it as being a pervy but I see it as "ART" its "perfection" and "charm"
