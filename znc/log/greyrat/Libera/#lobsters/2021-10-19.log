[00:00:30] <rb> RAII? :^)
[00:00:47] <rb> zig also has a thing called "errdefer"
[00:01:03] <technomancy> isn't defer just a shittier notation for try/finally?
[00:01:21] <rb> no, cause no exceptions
[00:01:21] <deadk> i think i find the notation nicer
[00:01:33] <deadk> i don't think no exceptions invalidates it but it also isn't anyway
[00:01:59] <rb> because error types are baked into language, it has error union types, and when you return an error value then errdefer statements are run
[00:02:02] <deadk> finally blocks are executed in the dynamic environment and can do things like assigning local variables or returning or whatever
[00:02:07] <rb> this makes cleanup on error value much nicer
[00:02:11] <kline> defer is more like goto fail but less terribke
[00:02:12] <deadk> iirc defers can't, but it's a while since i looked at them

[00:11:45] <iDrougge> In Swift, that would be `let thing = { /* compute it */ return it }()`
[00:12:00] <dimadima> kline why would you say that tests are cost-free?
[00:12:02] <iDrougge> I.e. you assign the result of a block to the value.
[00:12:36] *** Quits: winter (~quassel@user/winter) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[00:12:59] <iDrougge> In Kotlin, I think the idiomatic way would be `val thing = Thing().with { /* setup */ }`
[00:13:57] <iDrougge> I think one part in the false dichotomy is that the most famous/rabid advocate of tests is also a vehement enemy of types.
[00:14:03] <kline> dimadima, having worked in test engineering we had 2 test people covering ~100 developers and still finding time to do all sorts of non-critical stuff. 2% of your cost being on tests is a net saving tbh
[00:15:34] <dimadima> they must have been good
[00:15:40] <kline> dimadima, on the flip side, how many hours have been lost to reworking function signatures to better set out data types, fighting the borrow checker, etc?
[00:15:59] <iDrougge> Zero?
[00:16:19] <dimadima> i find those experiences often help elucidate the domain tremendously
[00:16:28] <kline> iDrougge, any definition where you say "zero" to that i would argue that test development is equally zero time lost on tests
[00:16:33] <dimadima> if you know when you stop
[00:17:36] <kline> dimadima, i think the same is true of tests. when you have to think about your system from a testability point of view, it can help bring architecture decisions into focus, as well as make you think more carefully about what the code does and why, rather than just how

[00:19:29] <iDrougge> kline: Using types effectively means you can concentrate on the tests that matter.
[00:19:34] <kline> many type systems will quite happily let you say an age of 999 is valid
[00:19:43] <dimadima> kline: i don't disagree at all. fwiw i think you can think about your code like that w/ actually writing the tests. not as effectively, of course, but writing testable code often seems nearly as good as then writing the tests, too

[00:19:51] <kline> iDrougge, right - you should use both. they are complementary, not mutually exclusive
[00:19:52] <dimadima> kline: most will
[00:19:59] <iDrougge> You can test your types instead of testing every path that type traverses.
[00:20:14] <kline> types will make you ensure that you wont have someone who is asparagus years old
[00:20:34] <iDrougge> Yes.
[00:20:43] <kline> tests will help you ensure the boundary/exceptional conditions and that 999 years old isnt produced
[00:20:46] <iDrougge> I was going to write that, too.
[00:21:11] <iDrougge> Mind you, dependent types are a thing.
[00:21:12] <dimadima> i think we're all in agreement here. i'm just taken by the extreme perspective that if you don't write tests you might as well not write code
[00:21:21] <dimadima> and that it's trivially easy
[00:21:29] <dimadima> my experience is writing tests takes a longgggg time
[00:21:42] <kline> dimadima, i find the same with types
[00:21:45] <dimadima> there is plenty of boilerplate, for starters. once you get past the boilerplate, i still don't know how you get to 2%
[00:21:52] <kline> i spent a long time trying to find which correct Instant type to use in rust
[00:22:02] <kline> there were several implementations and none were quite right
[00:22:05] <iDrougge> I often defer writing tests until I refactor something because rewriting too many of them can be quite a chore.
[00:22:13] <kline> and i spent a fair amount of time fiddling conversions
[00:22:17] <kline> and then the borrow checker...
[00:22:18] <kline> whew
[00:22:19] <dimadima> 15%? 20%? but 2%... i dont know
[00:22:41] <kline> its like any tool, you wont see the payoffs until you are reasonably proficient
[00:22:56] <iDrougge> Wouldn't untyped Rust still have the borrow checker?
[00:22:58] <kline> poor proficiency and payoff at the start shouldnt justify banging out early
[00:23:16] <kline> iDrougge, i guess im talking more broadly about dyanmic tests vs. static analysis
[00:23:16] <dimadima> i would say i'm pretty proficient at testing

[00:23:35] <dimadima> i would even say i love testing
[00:23:45] <kline> id really say that everyone who likes types and or testing should watch it
[00:24:02] <dimadima> i would potentially enjoy a job writing tests
[00:24:16] <dimadima> "ideology" in the url though
[00:24:21] <kline> trust me
[00:24:29] <dimadima> :)
[00:24:31] <kline> also >a job writing tests
[00:24:49] <iDrougge> Testops.
[00:24:52] <kline> a good test engineer will write lots of tools and systems to make the tests writing more intuitive
[00:25:11] <kline> same as we dont write in asm, we use all sorts of handy shortcuts when writing code
[00:25:28] <deadk> well you'd hope that those systems would already exist for everyone to use
[00:25:35] <dimadima> someone once referred to me as a "tool fetishist"
[00:25:35] <deadk> as they do in normal programming
[00:25:49] <dimadima> i don't think they meant it positively but i took it as a compliment
[00:26:02] <kline> deadk, people still write compiler etc extensions for specific platforms and their domains, the same is true with us
[00:26:12] <kline> a lot of my work was better interfacing reliably with hardware
[00:33:05] <indigo> Gary Bernhardt is a great speaker; love his prezos
[00:33:46] <kline> same
[00:34:11] <technomancy> it is true
[00:34:45] <technomancy> except sometimes he says shit like "compiled language" to mean "emits machine code"; other than that I really enjoy his writing/talks

[00:36:38] <dimadima> and you still want software
[00:38:24] <kline> i think thats a strange place to decide thats where you draw the line
[00:38:30] <kline> id rather less features
[00:39:40] <kline> someone not proficient in the features of static languages like types, borrow checker, etc would say the same about rust, for example, but thats besides the point

[13:57:30] <VicMackey> Hello! I wish I had an account to upvote this story: https://lobste.rs/s/8xihmq/what_s_hostname . I swear yesterday I was trying to write a Regex to validate a hostname, and the first thing I did was to find RFCs that describe what's a valid hostname, dns name, etc. Holly crap. I must say that I ended up giving up after the 5th chained RFC lol
[13:57:31] <mockturtle> [ Whatâ€™s in a hostname? ] - lobste.rs
[13:57:48] <VicMackey> TL;DR: good luck if you want to write a "technically correct" regex to validate a hostname
[14:01:27] <VicMackey> PS: have you considered allowing an unprivileged sign up to the website? Like allowing people to sign up so they can fav stuff, but so that they cannot comment or make their upvotes visible until they get invited by someone else. I keep searching on Hacker News for these stories so I can fav them :3 - Only if I had some kind of feature on my browser which helped me storing favorite websites...
[14:06:34] <c355E3B> I feel like adding an extra tier of account opens us up to new sorts of issues.

[14:36:18] <VicMackey> gerikson, in my case I have to validate a hostname using Go, and I started building a Regex because the most popular validator project seems to be abandoned. And as I learned afterwards by checking the RFCs, their hostname validation regex seems to lack some things - totally understandable, btw
[14:36:35] <VicMackey> gerikson, it seems that ANYTHING is valid for a hostname
[14:37:11] <VicMackey> Except for labels longer than 63 chars and FQDN > 200dontrememeber
[14:37:54] <VicMackey> Then you've got stuff like you SHOULDN'T use a hyphen after the 2nd character of the label because of the punycode you mentioned. You could have a xn-- whatever char too
[14:38:01] <VicMackey> So fun stuff

[18:23:32] <gerikson> dang I always forget what Nim is
[18:23:40] <gerikson> is it hte typed functional JAvascript?
[18:23:48] <cb> it's the c that looks like python
[18:23:48] <iDrougge> No, it's the compiled Python.
[18:23:53] <gerikson> ah ok
[18:24:01] <gerikson> so it's not Zig, the C that looks like C
[18:24:03] <cb> elm is the authoritarian functional javascript
[18:24:17] <gerikson> there are more than 3 letters people!
[18:24:45] <iDrougge> Not if you care about backwards compatibility with MS-DOS, which a surprising amount of people seem to do.
[18:24:47] <gerikson> Nix is the Linux that looks like Haskell
[18:24:52] <rhn_mk1> gwozniak: nice, obvious in hindsight, and utterly horrible

[18:37:45] <technomancy> (my own very superficial way of telling them apart)
[18:38:33] <companion_cube> meh, nim also has some implicit memory management
[18:38:36] <companion_cube> nim is much higher level than zig
[18:38:49] <companion_cube> it's somewhere between pascal, C, and lisp

[23:57:06] <wink> does anyone know if you can make a bookmarklet with "document.querySelectorAll ...." to autofill a form on click?
[23:57:14] <wink> or do you have to paste it in the dev console?
[23:57:44] <wink> I mean, the location.href-bookmarklets do work in this browser
[23:59:09] <wink> aha, a simple ; void(0) } at the end fixes it
