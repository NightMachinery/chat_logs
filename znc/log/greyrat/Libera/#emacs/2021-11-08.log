[03:16:34] <John_Ivan> hi, how can I write a word in an emacs buffer and highlight/mark it as executable, which I can hover over and run code on enter?
[03:17:33] <jamzattack> John_Ivan: in a regular buffer?
[03:17:43] <John_Ivan> like suppose I wanted to have a buffer with some text. some words I want to highlight so that the user can select/move between them with the arrow keys. once they hit enter on any of them, it should execute code I've written for each word.
[03:17:46] <John_Ivan> jamzattack, I'm not sure.
[03:18:22] <John_Ivan> jamzattack, my goal is to make a small little menu out of text.
[03:19:11] <jamzattack> John_Ivan: See (info "(elisp) Buttons") for some introduction to that kind of thing
[03:19:18] <lagash> John_Ivan: sounds like you might want to look at Hyperbole... lots and lots of buttons...
[03:19:29] <lagash> well, it might be overkill :P
[03:19:37] <John_Ivan> sweet. thank you.
[03:19:50] <pjb> John_Ivan: (let ((start (point))) (insert "word") (let ((end (point))) (make-text-button start end 'action (lambda (&rest args) (message "action!")))))
[03:20:25] <jamzattack> lagash: I always liked the button system from Hyperbole, bummer that it's not a separate package but needs the whole bloody thing

[03:24:00] <John_Ivan> jamzattack, will it be persistent?
[03:25:00] <jamzattack> perrierjouet: 460.0 KiB (priv) + 320.5 KiB (shared) = 780.5 KiB
[03:25:49] *** Quits: jsto (~jsto@user/jsto) (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
[03:26:07] <jamzattack> John_Ivan: It will be persistent as long as the text in the buffer is persistent -- if you mean "will a button I made in a file stay when I open that file again?", then no, because it's not the same buffer
[03:26:24] <jamzattack> John_Ivan: But it's certainly possible to implement that
[03:26:26] *** Joins: jsto (~jsto@user/jsto)

[03:29:09] <John_Ivan> jamzattack, no. it isn't much work. I'm just trying to understand what is the standardized approach to do this.
[03:29:41] <John_Ivan> jamzattack, my goal is to make a file. I don't know what extension it would go by, but I want that, everytime I read this file, to load text, along with buttons aan.
[03:29:45] <John_Ivan> buttons.
[03:30:16] <John_Ivan> which, when pressed/entered in emacs, it executes the code written for it. which isn't shown in emacs' interface of course.
[03:31:11] <jamzattack> Seems totally doable then, probably reading a separate file for the button definitions would be the most sensible
[03:33:54] <John_Ivan> excellent. cheers.

[04:38:17] <bpalmer> rubynt: as background first, indentation is always mode (programming language) specific, which is part of why talk about changing indentation is always a bit complicated.

[04:39:10] <bpalmer> rubynt: second, in C and C++, and most programming language modes, TAB is used to switch among valid indentation points; when you hit the TAB key, by default it's not about inserting whitespace but going to the "correct" column

[04:39:35] <bpalmer> rubynt: that's why if it thinks you should be at column 2, and you hit TAB, you don't move (or if you're not on column 2, you're moved to it)
[04:40:09] <bpalmer> rubynt: to change how many columns each indentation point should be, you need to adjust the variable c-basic-offset
[04:40:36] <bpalmer> that would let you indent to column 4, 8, 12, etc. one way to do this is to change it in your c-mode-common-hook
[04:41:00] <s-liao> Yes.
[04:41:45] <s-liao> If really want to do that. Like make your command (insert "\t"). then repeat the command.

When making a commit with Magit (and the status window changes to type in a commit message), another window opens with magit-diff-mode showing the diff. Is there a way to disable this from opening a new window...it's unreadable with all my existing splits anyway.

[09:06:18] <bpalmer> xaltsc: could you give an example of it working and not working?
[09:07:07] <bpalmer> xaltsc: but, at the heart of it, I think you're running into the issue that macros are expanded and then their result evaluated at some later time.
[09:07:30] <bpalmer> So, given a variable that isn't set until runtime,  a macro can't be expanded based on the variable; the variable hasn't been set yet!
[09:08:45] <xaltsc> Yeah, I guess there's no way around it...
[09:12:23] <s-liao> macroexpand?

[09:12:23] <bpalmer> it'd be possible to play around with manually deferring something (perhaps not with macroexpand, but instead with eval, for example), but it ends up being a bit suspect

[09:13:10] <bpalmer> if you're setting up a fixed set of colors, you could go the other way: have a struct defining the current colors, and then a function that assigns the relevant fields from an alist, and then the code looks to the struct (or alist, etc)

[09:27:38] <bpalmer> no, actually, it couldn't. Sorry, again, it comes down to macroexpansion vs runtime
[09:28:00] <bpalmer> You can eval a macro form at runtime to get a "deferred" macroexpansion but you're just playing fast and loose with things at that point.

[09:58:45] <talismanick> Nothing so complicated
[09:59:05] <talismanick> Let's start with Scheme
[09:59:08] <talismanick> Scheme is simple

[10:02:56] <s-liao> Yes.(define var 0)
[10:03:06] <talismanick> Let's that lambda from earlier and copy it verbatim into a "define" form
[10:03:22] <talismanick> (define fun (lambda (n) (+ n 5)))
[10:03:50] <talismanick> (fun var) adds 5 to whatever your value for "var" was
[10:04:18] <talismanick> In other words, we've assigned a function to a name the same way we'd do so for a variable
[10:04:24] *** Quits: APic (apic@apic.name) (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[10:05:15] <talismanick> Now, run M-x ielm (the Emacs Lisp REPL) and try assigning a function with (defvar my-fun (lambda (n) (+ n 5)))
[10:05:31] <talismanick> then try calling (my-fun 17) and see what happens
[10:05:52] <talismanick> s-liao: 
[10:06:08] <s-liao> Yes
[10:06:24] <talismanick> What did it return?
[10:06:38] <s-liao> Symbol’s function definition is void: my-fun
[10:07:16] <talismanick> When you bound the name to the lambda, it didn't vanish - this is Lisp, a proper programming language, not a rickety shack of silent errors like PHP 
[10:08:06] <talismanick> Because functions and variables live in different namespaces in Emacs Lisp, you have to use (funcall my-fun 10) to get back an answer
[10:08:22] *** Joins: srijan (~srijan@user/srijan)
[10:09:13] <talismanick> s-liao: So, what does that have to do with macro expansions, right?
[10:09:23] <s-liao> Yes. (funcall my-fun 10) works
[10:10:00] <talismanick> Well, macros in Lisp may be far more powerful than textual substitution macros like in C, but it's still a substitution mechanism
[10:10:36] <talismanick> Only, it operates on the parse tree, pasting in the body for the surface syntax you defined, instead of the source text
[10:11:30] <talismanick> So it's not super sophisticated, particularly with regards to variable bindings. A macro expands at compile time, so it (is supposed to) know nothing about the values at runtime, including scoping
[10:11:57] <talismanick> This means they can, at times, expand and generate names which cover up (clobber) the values of functions and variables at run time
[10:12:36] <s-liao> yes.
[10:13:06] <talismanick> So, Scheme treating functions and variables as one and the same means it has to do complex bookkeeping for macros to be "hygienic" (not dirty up the namespace by clobbering bindings)
[10:13:55] <talismanick> So its macros (for serious implementations) are hairier and altogether quite different from those of Emacs and Common Lisp
[10:14:38] <talismanick> Because Scheme has one global namespace (making it a Lisp-1) whereas Emacs Lisp has 2 (making it a Lisp-2)
[10:14:43] <s-liao> That is true.

[10:18:51] <talismanick> I'm not sure I get it either, but that's how I've seen it explained

[10:22:52] <talismanick> s-liao: Parentheses in Lisp correspond precisely to what's known as an "abstract syntax tree" (AST) - the internal representation (as some kind of tree, with structs for nodes and pointers between, for example) of a program which an interpreter "walks" to execute the program
[10:22:57] <technomancy> elisp is like ... lisp-5 or something
[10:23:10] <technomancy> there's much more than 2; it's actually kind of ridiculous
[10:23:26] <talismanick> The macro "expands" by looking at where it's called in that AST
[10:23:34] <talismanick> and substituting the body for that
[10:23:46] <technomancy> it's like emacs devs saw CL and were like "we'll beat them at their own game; why not a completely separate namespace just for ... uh I dunno; faces?"
[10:23:53] <bpalmer> well the real world is like 11 dimensional but we ignore things like that so we don't have to do so much math.
[10:24:10] <talismanick> It's primitive, yet powerful in its ability to "cover up" boilerplate patterns in code
[10:24:11] <bpalmer> 2 < 5 < 11 , so lisp-2 it is.

[15:23:41] <rudybot> bpalmer: in an ideal world, by applying annotations to any given schema i could effectively partition it into two sparse schemas, call them "signal" and "noise", that when overlaid on each other were identical to the original. these could be used in one direction by a function that transformed some original.xml to an information-dense and easy to work with signal.sexp. in the other direction, another function would use those s
[15:24:28] <bpalmer> rudybot: sounds like you want a fourier filter written in XSLT
[15:24:30] <jbe> why do the transmitters bother sending the noise in the first place

[16:05:01] <codingquark> twb: it is still nowhere near those ebook readers it seems
[16:05:17] <codingquark> Perhaps when you disable radio and only read PDF, it would use less?
[16:05:38] <twb> 23:05 <twb> When it's idling, with radio and backlight off, it seems to use maybe 0.8% per hour?  (very rough estimate)  With standard refresh that was going up considerably with use.  Haven't tested on lowest refresh rate yet
[16:06:32] <twb> I do think it's not turning off the wifi as aggressively as the kobo did, which is why I was manually turning it off
[16:06:48] <codingquark> twb: do the ebook readers have "refresh" rates? I think they only refresh when we turn pages etc
[16:06:53] <twb> codingquark: oh yes
[16:07:08] <twb> codingquark: it's how often it does a "reset every pixel" refresh
[16:07:21] <twb> codingquark: the default on a kobo is something like every 6 pages
[16:07:23] <codingquark> To remove ghosting, presumably
[16:07:35] <bkhl> I have one of those and it matches my experience.
[16:07:49] <twb> to be fair I am also using the wacom tablet to make notes the whole time, rather than actually reading
[16:08:06] <twb> it did also pair completely cleanly with a BT keyboard

[16:09:37] <twb> BT was more like 150kB/s IIRC
[16:09:41] <codingquark> Cannot be configured? Perhaps things like "control *from*"

[21:24:03] <TRS-80> Shortstop: I get that.  But Emacs is a beast which takes years to fully master.  Maybe now is not the time, but next time you have some time (like Sat AM or whatever, over nice cup of $beverage) just keep it in mind.  Or schedule it for such a time.
[21:24:15] <Shortstop> for sure, makes sense

[23:26:55] <krux02> johnjay, yes
[23:27:23] <krux02> johnjay, I wrote it to work in regular emacs and I am using doom distribution since today.
[23:27:30] <krux02> So the introduction of doom broke it, 100% sure
[23:27:41] <johnjay> er i didn't get that
[23:27:48] <johnjay> you're saying you tried it in doom and it doesn't work there

[23:28:02] <krux02> yes
[23:28:08] <krux02> I also found the source of the problem
[23:28:12] <johnjay> what is it

[23:28:40] <krux02> here doom emacs fucks with prog-mode
[23:28:41] <johnjay> yeah idk about font-lock-*-face but overlays can definitely overwrite each other

[23:28:56] <krux02> font-lock
[23:29:00] <krux02> no overlay
[23:29:10] <krux02> and prog-mode isn't supposed to do any font-locking

[23:42:01] <technomancy> jirido: are there other programs than vim that use "yank"?
[23:42:09] <technomancy> I've never heard of it outside vim and emacs
[23:42:09] <bandali> afaik simply because emacs predates that terminology all those other programs :)
[23:42:11] <Catie> jirido: Because Emacs is very old and its terminology was developed before the cut/copy/paste terminology

[23:43:14] <neeasade> I guess in the sense that reddit killed forums, /r/emacs could move to some forum, if blockchain-i-fying really kills it (narratow: it won't)
[23:43:27] <acdw> neeasade i have no idea, tbh

[23:44:50] <johnjay> why not just delete it from core-editor.el then?
[23:45:14] <mfiano> Catie: PDP-8 used the term in the 60's
[23:45:19] <krux02> I mean I could probably change my mode to override any existing highlighting somehow. But that isn't the point. The point is, in core emacs it works. it was written for it to work, and in doom emacs it is broken.
[23:45:43] <johnjay> i don't see what you mean
[23:45:44] <neeasade> krux02: you can also ask around the doom discord, it's fairly active
