[00:42:47] <Deknos> .. overload of information?
[00:42:48] <PerfDave> Out Of Interest
[00:42:58] <PerfDave> I'm curious why you're asking :)
[00:43:46] <Deknos> let's say my backup behaviour was inefficent in the past.. and i have several times just copied my home with all my data in the last 10 years (kind of a data hoarder) on several external disks. and now i want to consolidate that
[00:44:10] <Deknos> and if i want to delete doubles, i want, if possible whole directories which are doubles deleted
[00:44:21] <Deknos> and not only a dublette here and there.
[00:44:55] <PerfDave> I'm sure you could come up with some kind of script which compares different homedirs and grabs the most recent version of any conflicts :)
[00:45:14] <Deknos> therefore i wanted to record the state of the file (creation, modification, access, size, path, names, md5sum) and then make of this the newest ones/differences
[00:45:27] <Deknos> also, it's so big that it does not fit on my 12tb disk
[00:45:32] <PerfDave> Oof
[00:45:39] <Deknos> so i have to test for different disk contents.
[00:46:04] <PerfDave> Any chance that's down to a relatively small number of large files and you can tackle those first to give you room to do the rest? :)
[00:46:16] <Deknos> i already started writing some python code which writes this into a database, so i can work over the metadata, but i wondered if nobody else has done this already
[00:46:25] <Deknos> sadly... no.
[00:47:14] <Deknos> i have code also from a time where i did not use git, i have quite an archive of emails (MLs and personal ones), humblebundle stuff, videos and pictures from myself, data hoarded ebook archives and stuff like that

[00:49:13] <Deknos> well i won't be able to compress it under 3-4 tb, but i have a few disks with 4tb, and after synchronizing it, i will give some to another trusted party...

[00:52:09] <PerfDave> Might be worth renting some storage temporarily to deduplicate *to*? AWS S3 bucket or similar? Give you some breathing room.
[00:52:17] <Deknos> sadly fdupes has no strategy like "keep from all duplicates the newest or oldest one"
[00:53:02] <Deknos> hrm, i somehow doubt that 10-20 terabytes for a few months are that cheap?
[00:53:26] <PerfDave> Yeah, if it'll take you months rather than days that may not be cost effective
[00:54:28] <Deknos> yeah, 1 month is to short perhaps, two months would be manageable but still i think cost prohibitive
[00:54:31] <PerfDave> Then again, S3 Glacier is about $1/TB/mo

[01:18:22] <tga> running nextcloud is not a problem. can you really point it at 8T of files and use it for searching?
[01:18:37] * tga looks at fzf
[01:19:27] <tga> fzf looks nice, but can it index files at all?
[01:19:57] <pasiz> depends on resources, underlying filesystem etc.
[01:20:51] <tga> ext4, mostly media files, pdf and documents
[01:20:55] <packet_lozenge> tga: can't say I've used either of the tools I've suggested for that much data heh

[01:21:51] <pasiz> what you are trying to search inside media files
[01:21:57] <PerfDave> https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_fulltextsearch or similar
[01:22:14] <PerfDave> I mean GNOME and KDE probably have file indexing services which can do this
[01:23:19] <tga> this is a file server, no gnome and kde on it
[01:23:40] <tga> clients mount smb shares
[01:24:09] <tga> not a good idea to search client side, terribly slow in any case
[01:24:19] <tga> nextcloud looks promising
[01:24:33] <PerfDave> So what you'll want is somethign that generates smb:// URLs?
[01:24:34] <tga> I never thought to use it as just the interface to a NAS
[01:24:50] <tga> not even, something that will tell me where the file is, even in absolute server urls
[01:25:06] <PerfDave> I do wonder if there's a Samba-friendly way to provide a centrally-generated index to clients.
[01:25:18] <tga> https://github.com/ehoppmann/mlocate-web

[01:36:19] <PerfDave> that's a few years old now though, so who knows
[01:37:13] <PerfDave> Anyway, seems like Windows Search Service is the "right" way to do it, so your Windows clients can run searches against the server-side index. But something like Nextcloud with a full-text search plugin will give you a relatively pointy-drooly UI that people can use to find files.

[07:03:46] <nickgaw> Hi, With btrfs snapshots from what I read you have to unmount the volume then role back the snapshots on the main volume so my system with one hard drive could it effectively create snapshots mounted?
[07:07:04] <Affliction> you can create your snapshots within a subvolume that's mounted within your active filesystem
[07:07:34] <Affliction> My preference is to have, at the root of the filesystem, a @ subvol containing /, and @snapshots, which is mounted at /snapshots
[07:08:02] *** Joins: tieinv (~tieinv@user/tieinv)
[07:08:06] <Affliction> at which point snapshots are immediately visible in /snapshots
[07:08:32] <Affliction> But, my plan for a full rollback involves using a live environment still.
[07:08:59] <nickgaw> Is there any filesystem that can do running in place snapshoting and role back?
[07:09:01] <Affliction> Rename @ to @old, make a read-write copy of the snapshot I want to restore to as @, and with my mount options that 'just works'
[07:09:17] <Affliction> not that I know of
[07:09:36] *** Joins: Arrowmaster (~Arrowmast@user/arrowmaster)
[07:09:38] <Affliction> I'd expect that could end up causing problems
[07:10:39] <Affliction> for instance, apps having a different concept of what's in memory to what's on disk
[07:11:26] <Affliction> That could probably destroy database files (server or embedded like sqlite), since the in-memory cache wouldn't know about hte rollback
[07:11:44] <Affliction> But, I don't know. Maybe it is possible to do safely and I just don't know the method
[07:14:34] <nickgaw> I was also trying to build a custom network installation image with a custom task that would install things like build-essential and other tools that I like to use but on the debian wiki there is not a lot of information on how to do such a task just adding packages to the iso image to remaster it but it does not say how those packages you add will be selectable for installation?

[09:13:41] <Affliction> can you rename a root subvol while it's mounted?
[09:13:41] <cdhowie> and no, live rollback while mounted isn't achievable
[09:13:48] <cdhowie> yes

[12:44:34] <yetoo_> I'm trying to make a user to be able to be logged in via ssh with no password and without public keys. Have tried to set PermitEmptyPasswords to yes in sshd_config and restarted it, but that didnt work. I cant use keys because some old software can only use username and doesnt support password or keys
[12:46:04] <idioterna> hmmm that's going to probably also require some PAM config changes, i can't test right now, but look into /etc/pam.* stuff
[12:49:11] <idioterna> i suppose you know this, but still: this opens up a large surface area for attacks, make sure you tighten security at the network level and importantly, add monitoring for it from a random external host, so you'll know when you accidentally allow public connections
[12:53:20] <yetoo_> idioterna: it will be sandboxed and virtualized and all other sorts of separation

[14:23:43] <tcurdt-> is there a way to not having to provide "-y --no-install-recommends" on "apt-get -y --no-install-recommends install"? via conf or via env?
[14:24:06] <tcurdt-> it's for a non-interactive install
[14:25:28] <Khepra> tcurdt-: yes. lemme find the knobs to flick...
[14:27:19] <Khepra> hrm, can't find the manpage or authoritative document at the moment, so feel free to investigate deeper. but in short, you can configure apt via /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/<somefile> , and in that file put config option   APT::Install-Recommends "false";
[14:27:35] <tcurdt-> ah .. ok

[14:28:02] <Khepra> to skip confirmation your apt executing environment needs env var  DEBIAN_FRONTEND="noninteractive"
[14:29:08] <tcurdt-> thx! I got that already - although I am unsure about the relationship to "-y"
[14:29:33] <tcurdt-> if it is noninteractive - shouldn't the "-y" be implicit already?
[14:29:37] <Khepra> noninteractive frontend doesn't require confirmation and assumes defaults
[14:30:41] <Khepra> ah you know what... I see what you mean, --yes is still needed, the noninteractive env only skips various other questions like dpkg-reconfigure's
[14:32:07] <tcurdt-> that feels a bit inconsistent - but thanks for confirming it :)
[14:33:19] <Khepra> yeah, unfortunately I never bothered to throughly investigate and find documentation about it. I just have it documented in my automations cripts, ie. do this to achieve that, kthnxbai.
[14:33:46] <Khepra> I mean short of looking through teh source, and ain't nobody got time for that. but taht's typical for FOSS-y documentation, so, meh.
[14:34:19] <tcurdt-> true :)
[14:36:16] <Khepra> all the SO posts also mention the knobs but don't link to origin documentation. I think maybe there's `perldoc` of it, but I cba to hunt for it now.

[19:58:42] <tohoyn> Hello. I just installed Debian 11 to my laptop. Problem is that the system is unable to boot from the hard disk and I have to boot it from an USB stick (but anyway the system is loaded from the hard disk). I suppose there is something wrong with GRUB configuration.
[19:59:08] <tohoyn> When I try to boot the system without the USB stick it shows the grub prompt.

[20:03:46] <sney> from your running system, do 'grub-install /dev/yourharddrivehere' and then 'update-grub' and if there are no errors, reboot, you should not need the usb stick anymore

[21:59:05] <Walex> node1: not quite, most relational databased or databased in general can have variable length fields, and then some using B-trees do not fill DBMS blocks 100%.
[21:59:38] <Walex> node1: also note that DBMS "blocks" can be (usually) larger than filesystem blocks (not a good idea to set them smaller).
[22:00:17] <Walex> node1: so a DBMS block can cover several filesystem blocks which can take several disk sectors.
