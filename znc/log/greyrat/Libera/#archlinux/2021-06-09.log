[09:46:15] <blinux> There is no OK button at the top most level. But, that might not be the problem.
[09:46:57] <blinux> Well, there is, but that doesn't close the program. It takes you further down.
[09:47:31] *** Joins: bud (~bud@user/bud)
[09:47:44] <blinux> But, the check box for installing packages is taking effect, but not for change settings. I want to set mwo=force
[09:48:15] <ruru> I think once you press "OK" the relevant setting is applied, could be mistaken though

[09:49:03] <blinux> I would think so too, but if I re-open the program the check box is not there like it is for installed packages. Also, where it says it creates a .reg file in the terminal at that path if I browse there there is no reg file for mwo
[09:49:22] *** Joins: BADGumby (~badgumby@znc.badgumby.com)
[09:49:28] <blinux> So, I do not believe it is taking effect.
[09:49:48] <blinux> The problem I'm trying to solve is mouse movement is getting stuck in a game. The capture is not reliable.

[15:00:19] <arch-angel> ok
[15:00:26] <lacrymology> thebombzen: the monitor works with my other computer.. and.. can I even plug the monitor to the TV? what I tested was the computer to the TV over HDMI. That worked before. Like two weeks ago
[15:00:53] <thebombzen> does that mini DP work for anything else?
[15:00:56] <arch-angel> ruru: i ran a file -L all the problematic libraries and they are all 32 bit libraries
[15:00:58] <lacrymology> haven't tested the monitor on a different HDMI, but I'm pretty confident that's not the issue, give that the TV stopped working
[15:01:02] <lacrymology> thebombzen: no idea how to check it
[15:01:08] <arch-angel> perhaps its an issue with x64 and x32?

[15:01:41] <lacrymology> but I don't know how to check
[15:01:41] <thebombzen> possibly the port is just disabled in BIOS, which you can do

[15:01:52] <lacrymology> I didn't do it, for sure
[15:02:05] <thebombzen> I find that unlikely since it reports "disconnected" t hough

[16:03:25] <JackWinter> i have a bit of an off topic question, hopefully it's ok and i can properly articulate my question :) i have no more functional printer, but my gf has one for the home office, i'd like to occasionally plug a network cable into it and to print from my own lan.  the printer is locked on an ip of 101.192.71.12 while my own LAN is a class C network on 10.9.8.x.  can i somehow setup the routing so that it sends directly to the printer IP instead of to the 
[16:03:27] <JackWinter> default routing, or would I have to add another network card and create a network for the same class C network that the printer is on?

[19:36:42] <raster> (broken flash blocks, broken controller chip etc.)
[19:36:51] <chazy> it can't be overheating, at least not for the past day i put a fan directly above the slot and the slot comes with a thermal pad that's also securing it (pressing from above)

[22:07:13] <gastondelar> im experiencing aparently random crashes in my iwlwifi intel wifi card and after that the card is no longer usable by either arch or windows until it equally randomly works again. i've done a bunch of testing in the frame of my very limited knowledge of this stuff and even tried a couple suggestions from the forum without success. Do you think its worth a shot contacting iwlwifi's devs ? what can i do in this situation 
[22:07:13] <gastondelar> ? I love the laptop and spent a ton of time setting it up so i'd like to keep it but im on a timer now to fix it or claim the warranty due to this problem

[22:08:16] <niki> It's not fixed by a complete shutdown and restart gastondelar (?)
[22:08:28] <grawity> an unexpectedly large "send-q" is also not good
[22:08:38] <gastondelar> niki: nope, at first a power cycle of the laptop did the trick, but now it doesn't any more
[22:09:06] <niki> I have an intel wifi card that breaks when you reboot, you have to shutdown completely, that's why i was asking :)
