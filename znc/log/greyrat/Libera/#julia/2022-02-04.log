[01:07:07] <Guest25> well that's it for me tonight.
[01:10:30] <edm> Guest25: I am new here too, and infact an EE by training so I live in serial port land often, but that’s a pretty niche question by Julia standards I think and this is a very quiet channel - Julia lives on Slack I understand - so you may have much more success finding the one or two julia users who would know on the slack
[01:16:28] <Guest25> i will never use slack again
[01:17:08] <edm> well i guess you’re among friends here on irc
[01:17:15] <Guest25> i'll rather go through the IDs and speeds and all by hand, but thanks for trying to help
[01:17:20] <edm> but yes, it might reduce the number of potential fish
[01:17:39] <Guest25> yes, it is unfortunate
[01:17:54] <edm> have you any sort of electronics equipment?
[01:18:00] <edm> a scope, a logic analyser, etc
[01:18:39] <edm> a number of my linux serial problems were resolved by a logic analyser confirming what i found it otherwise hard to ascertain - whether or not the message was actually being sent
[01:18:54] <edm> or only partially sent and having some sort of buffer/sync/flush bug
[01:19:05] <Guest25> Not at hand no. I connected the adapter to another adapter, that's how i saw that it sends correctly
[01:20:03] <edm> roger, that seems like a reasonable debugging strategy
[01:21:56] <Guest25> i might try to connect the other adapter also to the send of the device. Perhaps i could see if the reply is correct like that or it nukes my adapters
[01:22:50] <Guest25> but it's getting late, so not tonight
[01:28:17] <Guest25> another option would be to know where to put the print-function in that readuntil-thing. Or maybe i misunderstood that, cause the example is a bit weird.

[05:29:58] <vin> Hi, is there a way to label each dot in a dot plot?
[05:35:44] <adigitoleo> vin: Should be possible with series_annotations, https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/generated/attributes_series/
[05:38:01] <vin> perfect thanks adigitoleo any way to control the text size?
[05:39:39] <adigitoleo> hmm, maybe legendfontsize?
[05:41:24] <vin> That is only changing the size of texts in legend box
[05:41:27] <vin> not the annotations
[05:42:32] <vin> adigitoleo: 
[05:44:33] <adigitoleo> might need to use Plots.text objects instead of String
[05:47:02] <vin> Ah fixed it, thanks!
[05:48:37] <vin> Last question, anyway I can avoid annotations overlaping automatically?
[05:50:54] <vin> adigitoleo: 
[05:52:51] <adigitoleo> I think that's quite tricky, not sure if there's a way to do that built-in
[05:53:49] <adigitoleo> friendly reminder to not use empty ping, better to type the nick in the message somewhere
[05:55:27] <adigitoleo> but if you've got a lot of annotations, it could be better to group them somehow
[05:57:42] <adigitoleo> You could draw shaded regions and tag the whole region, or tag the points by color (unless color is already used for something)
[05:58:36] <adigitoleo> hard to say without seeing the plot you want to make, so your best bet is to head to the forums with a screenshot

[18:22:05] <vin> makes sense, I could use different colors, I will read the docs on how to specify different colors for each y value. Thanks adigitoleo 
[18:51:41] <vin> Once I have provided a seriescolor and label (a list of strings) I see that only the first string in labels is viisible in legend when the array is space seperated but with comma seperation all the strings are associated with a single color, anyway I can avoid this?

[19:55:44] <vin> How do you specifiy axis attriibute to a subplot when using MakieLayout. Example if I have scene, layout = layoutscene(resolution = (1000, 700)); ax = layout[1, 1] = LAxis(scene); dotplot!(x,y, ___?) <- I expect to specify ax here

[21:32:34] <Guest25> I have yet to find out why the serial response function does not work. Even when i connected the serial adapters together and manually fed the correct response, it doesn't work, so it definately is that response part, that is not working as i expect, so i'm out of ideas.
