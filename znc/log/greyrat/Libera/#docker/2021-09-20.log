[00:19:54] <leitz> If a docker-compose build failed, and said to see a log file in /root/, how do I see the file? I assume the root is the docker image's root, but it's not running. Not even sure it built.

[00:25:09] <artok> docker build would give output to tty already, and another is to check for the container that is there (unless --rm used) and start it
[00:26:14] <leitz> artok, it seems like the container never actually built, and the tty output said:  Configure failed for .. See /root/.cpanm/work/1632081324.7/build.log for details.
[00:27:05] <artok> image is built, container that did the build step was started and might be dangling on docker daemon (docker ps -a)
[00:27:58] <artok> then you convert that container into image, start one with docker run on interactive mode and do less /your/log/file
[00:28:56] <leitz> How do I convert the container to an image?
[00:29:52] <leitz> I might have it.
[00:32:12] <leitz> Hmm... I did a docker commit <container id>  <container_name>, and then docker run -it <container_name> /bin/bash. It still says Configure failed for .. ,see /root/.....
[00:34:26] <artok> then commit container that is before the erroring command and run that same command on interactive mode
[00:35:12] <leitz> doing that now. I need to figure out how to remove all the old containers, as one of the old commands is causing the issue.
[00:36:15] <artok> good way to write dockerfiles: start container with -it and start typing all your RUN commmands there
[00:37:35] <artok> docker cp to get stuff into the container, so that will kind of "simulate" COPY, remembering that you should do only docker cp from the context that is sent to daemon for build

[18:32:31] <bn_work> tabakhase:  "un-linuxy" because most software would specify min. reqs in the docs which one is supposed to read?  If so, I'd agree but alas we are seeing some ... uh.. "challenged windows users" 😅

[18:40:24] <bn_work> tabakhase: lol, I don't think the avg Windows user has that level of knowledge to be able to "patch things out".  
[18:41:33] <bn_work> it's more to prevent them from trying to run a large multiservice/multi-process/threaded app on a toaster or a RasPi vs a CPU-Id check

[18:57:25] <programmerq> bn_work▸ the image doesn't have support for metadata around core/memory requirements, but your runtime configuration options should. You can do stuff like have kubernetes reject pod configurations that don't specify memory/cpu limit/reservations. You can achieve something similar in docker with a docker plugin, but I don't have a specific example to point to that makes it easy. Then whoever is
[18:57:27] <programmerq> doing the deploys would be force to think about what the requirements are, and that should hopefully get them to check the docs or check with the developers and be a catalyst for a discussion.

[18:58:40] <lmat> Fairly often, when I start docker, hard drive access becomes really slow. Docker might stall for like 20 seconds on "tagging image" after building for instance.
[18:59:19] <lmat> Also, when I write a file in the project, it might take many seconds. This is small files like `package.json`, etc.
[18:59:53] <lmat> Is anyone familiar with this problem and maybe know show to tell docker to smooth things out a bit? I'm not sure if it has to do with the overlayfs or maybe bind mounted volumes?
[19:00:08] <lmat> It's not very reproducible.
[19:02:24] <tabakhase> lmat os? filesystem? docker-version? anything else to tell about the host?

[19:07:17] <programmerq> bn_work▸ docker itself has a plugin capability that isn't super utilized-- never caught on really. there might be a third party plugin that could enforce that.
[19:07:21] <tang^> technical solutions to social problems never work
[19:07:41] <programmerq> compose doesn't have a plugin system, but you could use a compose linter to help highlight stuff like that.
[19:09:08] <programmerq> requiring cpu/memory to be set by whoever does deploys can cause them to overestimate the resources needed, which can lead to underutilization, so it's usually best to combine that requirement with some monitoring to measure actual vs requested and make updates.
[19:09:32] *** Quits: ExeciN (~ExeciN@user/nicexe) (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[19:09:58] <programmerq> but yes, the technical requirement of "we require cpu/memory limits/reservations to be declared" isn't a solution in and of itself, but it helps foster the discussions needed to help solve the problems.
[19:15:18] <bn_work> programmerq: fair enough, for us these requirements have been born from our own internal validation testing so we're just trying spare the customer and ourselves any "losing of hair" :)  When we've had anything less than the current reqs we've observed all sorts of very strange behavior, from timeouts to calls failing, etc.  The app has multiple (micro)services so one would think that theoretically all timeouts could be tuned to 
[19:15:18] <bn_work> make it work (however slow) on any hardware, but our devs don't know how so it has been left at that :)
[19:17:57] <tang^> well documented as part of the software should be sufficient
[19:18:05] <tang^> or even a blog article
[19:18:06] <bn_work> tang^: in an ideal world people doing the deploying would take the time to read the docs / rtfm, but ... users will be users :)
[19:18:18] <tang^> that's not my problem
[19:18:32] <bn_work> lucky you!
[19:18:44] <programmerq> making resource limits and requests mandatory is basically a requirement for large shared clusters. Otherwise, you'll get into a situation like you've described where stuff just performs poorly because it's crowded on a particular node. You can also get a situation where one node has a disproportionate amount of load that takes it down, which can schedule those workloads on other nodes, which can
[19:18:46] <programmerq> then take another node down, which just turns into a cascading failure.
[19:19:33] <tang^> no, it's not about luck... it's simply that I get to point questioners at the relevant documentation. "yeah, we mentioned that <here>"
[19:19:34] <programmerq> with reservations in place, even if a node does go down, it will only schedule those workloads out based on available capacity and the rest of the workloads will need to wait until capacity is added.
[19:19:57] <bn_work> yes ^^^

[19:41:30] <programmerq> mike18 it's usually a memory related thing-- it could be that the container had a memory limit and docker killed the process because it hit that limit.

[23:07:17] <crankharder> do/should I need to run ntpd inside a docker container or does the container get it's time from the host as long as it's running?

[23:13:42] <zoredache> crankharder: you don't need, ntp in a container.  Containers are not VMs. You can think of a container as just a process that has been isolated.

[23:34:46] <xheimlich> so I'm pretty naive to all this stuff and just prepare simple Dockerfiles to ensure reproducible builds here and on the deployment site, ok.
[23:35:41] <xheimlich> Here's the thing: a Dockerfile that downloads and installs ~5GB of stuff and subsequently removes it seems to "docker build" to a container that's still ~5GB.
[23:36:40] *** Joins: keypusher (keypusher@user/keypusher)
[23:36:45] <xheimlich> How can I free space?
[23:37:00] <xheimlich> meaning, make a smaller container in that situation.

[23:40:17] <programmerq> xheimlich▸ depending on the exact usecase, you'll need to do one of two things. 1) do the install and cleanup all in one RUN step. 2) install the build dependencies in an early stage, and then copy only the result to a final stage so that your published image doesn't have layers from an earlier build stage (multistage builds)
[23:40:44] <programmerq> the former is good for quick things like an apt install && someother command && apt purge / cleanup
[23:41:17] <programmerq> the latter is good where you need to do a full blown compile toolchain just to get an artifact built. The latter is very common for compiled languages.
[23:42:36] <xheimlich> programmerq: The exact usecase is pip/PyPI (Python package manager) is doing some dependency resolution wrong and installs scores of unnecessary packages.
[23:43:21] <xheimlich> Subsequently running pip uninstall a good chunk of them still leaves the system functional.
[23:43:36] <xheimlich> Can I run two RUN commands as a single layer? That might...
[23:43:39] <programmerq> just do the pip install and pip uninstall on the same RUN instructions
[23:43:51] <programmerq> pip install ... && pip uninstall ...
[23:44:02] <xheimlich> doh. I feel stupid.
[23:44:11] <programmerq> the RUN instruction wraps whatever you specify in a shell, and the shell handles the && for you.
[23:45:27] <xheimlich> Trying that. 
[23:49:28] <lmat> What is the difference between docker-compose and docker compose-cli?
[23:49:54] <lmat> I run `docker-compose --version` and get 1.28.2 or so. My friend runs the same command and gets "v2.0.0 rc2" or something!
[23:52:23] <zoredache> lmat: docker-compose is the traditional compose developed in python (I think) that has been around for a while.  The compose-cli is something new rewritten in golang and supposedly will become built if I read the docs right.
[23:53:01] <zoredache> https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#context-of-docker-compose-evolution
[23:56:51] <lmat> zoredache: Thank you for the info!
