[00:01:20] <ProfSimm> zicada: they key insight here is we're dumb by default
[00:01:43] <ProfSimm> So freedom for the masses is a bad thing. We need guidance. But guidance not for the purpose of someone's private monetary interest
[00:02:39] <zicada> ProfSimm: in principle you can have a decentralized internet
[00:03:18] <zicada> ProfSimm: but its a bit like an opposite peretroika, if you know your soviet history

[00:03:51] <ProfSimm> zicada: imagine you had decentralized body control.
[00:04:01] <ProfSimm> zicada: like your ass decides how to control your ass
[00:04:05] <zicada> but you want it to be "owned" then by more than just 2-3 companies ?
[00:04:22] <ProfSimm> zicada: who is email owned by
[00:04:52] <zicada> i dont take your point
[00:05:14] <ProfSimm> zicada: well there's a middle ground between decentralization and monopoly
[00:05:26] <ProfSimm> zicada: interoperable communication, and regulation
[00:05:39] <ProfSimm> No one owns the web (although Google is trying hard and sort of succeeding)
[00:05:41] <ProfSimm> Or email

[00:11:18] <ProfSimm> companies are of course trying to make it.
[00:11:19] <zicada> but accessible by everyone
[00:11:28] <zicada> yeah
[00:11:33] <zicada> facebook and google i guess
[00:11:39] <ProfSimm> Microsoft Passport (account), Facebook open graph
[00:11:43] <ProfSimm> Yeah and google
[00:11:48] <zicada> for me google is easily the choice out of those two, but i would prefer neither
[00:11:58] <ProfSimm> It should be neutral as you say
[00:12:02] <zicada> what we need is client access to blockchains, no intermediate broker

[00:12:22] <ProfSimm> Blockchains are terribly inefficient. They make sense for Bitcoin
[00:12:30] <ProfSimm> But I don't think it makes sense for something else

[01:45:32] <xx> that's my money
[01:45:32] <mycroftiv> why is it a matter of 'deserve' - why not just look at what goals can be collectively agreed upon to be worthwhile, and how to achieve them?
[01:45:51] <mycroftiv> i dont see anything about money or ownership thereof in the laws of physics
[01:45:52] <I_Am_M00t> woah woah xx , so you proved yourself wrong here
[01:46:01] <xx> how?
[01:46:17] <I_Am_M00t> if stuff can be paid for and the gov can pay for stuff, then you can give citizens guarantees
[01:46:25] <I_Am_M00t> you made a non-statement
[01:46:31] <mycroftiv> so claims about 'my money' need to be referred to an existing socioeconomic structure, and such structures often involve collective agreements about things like roads and healthcare
[01:46:33] <xx> I have no choice in paying to the gov

[01:47:42] <I_Am_M00t> you're just playing word games xx
[01:47:49] <xx> a man should not have special rights for being a man, neither should a woman, neither should a baby, neither should a black person, neither should a white person, ...
[01:48:03] <dTal> lol why not
[01:48:04] <I_Am_M00t> "but stuff can be paid for" <-- which cancels your first statement out xx
[01:48:10] <I_Am_M00t> it's a complete non-statement
[01:48:17] <dTal> what is this "should"
[01:48:25] <mycroftiv> who cares if we call things 'rights' or not, id rather build a world where babies have food and are healthy and dont need to be skill-culled mercilessly to have those things
[01:48:27] <dTal> "should" means nothing unless we can agree on some goals
[01:48:33] <dTal> we can't agree on some goals
[01:48:39] <xx> mycroftiv: and I'd rather build a world without babies in it

[01:49:48] <I_Am_M00t> xx: how does that remove babies?
[01:49:57] <dTal> you have no *reason* to want humans to go extinct beyond "I just do"
[01:50:03] <xx> I_Am_M00t: babies get older and no new ones are born -> no more babies
[01:50:14] <I_Am_M00t> xx: so kill humanity

[01:51:23] <I_Am_M00t> xx: so basically, you want to end humanity?
[01:51:37] <xx> I_Am_M00t: that's what extinction means
[01:51:50] <I_Am_M00t> gotcha
[01:52:02] <dTal> it's incoherent

[01:52:15] <dTal> nobody wants to go extinct
[01:52:21] <I_Am_M00t> maybe it's coherent, he's saying, "to solve all the problems we have, we can kill ourselves"
[01:52:23] <xx> so as time goes on, we won't need any rights for babies, because no babies exist, we won't need any rights for kids, because kids don't exist, and so on
[01:52:36] <dTal> no it's not coherent
[01:52:38] <I_Am_M00t> xx: ok, but you're saying end humanity
[01:52:41] <xx> slowly no more need for kindergartens, schools, ...
[01:52:53] <dTal> humans don't want to go extinct, so there's no movement here

[01:54:35] <I_Am_M00t> no it isn't

[01:56:09] <I_Am_M00t> well, they may have serious conversations, and sometimes troll
[01:56:28] <dTal> if it's trolling, it's trolling by someone presenting a completely consistent personality over the course of many months
