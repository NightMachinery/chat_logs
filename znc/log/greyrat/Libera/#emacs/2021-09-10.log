[00:03:43] <wgreenhouse> TRS-80: not easily. but the only thing special about the primary select method is that its group names aren't prefixed with the name of the server
[00:04:13] <wgreenhouse> TRS-80: you can search+replace inside .newsrc.eld, I think that's the only way
[00:04:36] <TRS-80> wgreenhouse: I did know that.  And I know about the nil one, etc.  Yeah maybe I will just make a backup and start over, copy stuff over maybe...
[00:05:04] <wgreenhouse> or just leave it, it's purely cosmetic

[00:06:32] <TRS-80> I mean, what you said is just the default?  Or it cannot be changed?

[00:08:00] <TRS-80> ya, figured

[00:08:08] <wgreenhouse> topics are basically foldable sections for *Group*
[00:08:46] <TRS-80> more important is keeping identities / connections separate; depending how that plays out, this sounds trivial and multiple ways to do it

[00:09:18] <wgreenhouse> yeah. my approach for that was so-called posting styles, which can dictate e.g. what smtp server to use based on criteria
[00:09:43] <wgreenhouse> but if you want more fully separate configs, or a mostly-offline gnus, that would be doable too

[00:13:24] <wgreenhouse> TRS-80: re 3: yes, those are the usual locations. if you set `gnus-home-directory`, those paths (for .newsrc* and Mail and News) will work from there, rather than from ~

[00:17:51] <bremner> likely story

So I decided that letting hosting provider handle it is easy and I still get the advantages.  For $20-30 per year, per domain, I think it's very worth it.  I own family surname domain, where I have my real name email, then I have some others where I keep my
[01:51:49] <TRS-80> aliases like TRS-80.  Again, all in line with separate identities as I mentioned (quite a bit) further up.  Plus you get some web hosts.

[07:16:21] <TRS-80> or combination of both
[07:16:23] <bpalmer> TRS-80: let binding  may be insufficient for a long running persistent application.
[07:16:32] <bpalmer> in the same way that let binding doesn't work for asynchronous calls.
[07:16:57] <TRS-80> I am so glad I asked what I thought would be obvious / simple, as I never would have considered that.
[07:17:11] <TRS-80> So I will just setq instead?
[07:17:35] <TRS-80> I can use that "final gnus exit function" to set them back to nil, I guess
[07:17:51] <wgreenhouse> apteryx: smtp server can be specified with posting styles

[07:32:21] <TRS-80> of course I have to be clever and write a recursive function to give a list of available identities, instead of just writing them in a list
[07:32:22] <apteryx> posting styles seem powerful!  How about setting smtpmail-smtp-server at the select method definition in my .gnus.el? Could each select method have a different SMTP server there, and when answering to a message from one of their groups, it'd be honored?

[07:33:17] <TRS-80> ok, maybe should have said select method
[07:33:28] <TRS-80> but answer is yes
[07:33:44] <apteryx> OK!  Then I wonder what I was afraid about all that time :-)
[07:33:50] <TRS-80> posting styles is for even further customization
[07:33:59] <TRS-80> just do it and check how it comes up before sending?
[07:34:10] <TRS-80> in the draft buffer I mean
[07:34:11] <apteryx> good idea
[07:34:55] <TRS-80> I gather that posting styles is for even finer grained customizations
[07:35:13] <TRS-80> but you can do all sort of interesting things like add headers etc,

[09:27:51] <johnjay> MysteriousSilver: that doesn't make sense to me
[09:28:11] <johnjay> i mean you can just make a new file called like C-x C-f asdf.abc and write in it
[09:28:32] <johnjay> that method might work if you're just making multiple scratch note files a day

[09:37:57] <talismanick> parsnip: You seem to have some experience with USPS woes.
[09:38:17] <parsnip> oh?
[09:38:21] <talismanick> It sounds as if the other end of the eBay transaction for a new laptop is also distraught at the state of affairs
[09:38:30] <talismanick> and they're ready to offer be a refund
[09:38:35] <parsnip> in my case it was with fedex
[09:38:49] <talismanick> although I'm holding out for my laptop to arrive out of the blue in the next few days
[09:39:09] <talismanick> (after all, I need time to set it up before I head off to live on campus)
[09:39:23] <talismanick> parsnip: Oh
[09:39:35] <parsnip> but generally i struggle with delivery
[09:39:37] <talismanick> I thought it was USPS because that's what was being talked about when I dropped by yesterday
[09:39:47] <talismanick> parsnip: Don't we all?
[09:40:03] <talismanick> What site should I be ordering laptops from? What service should I use for delivery?
[09:40:12] <talismanick> I am clueless and just need a goddamn laptop
[09:40:16] <parsnip> i have a usps order i'm waiting on, but i realize they have "hold mail for a month for pickup", so i'm trying that
[09:40:19] <talismanick> (one better than the Thinkpad I'm typing this from)
[09:40:43] <parsnip> depends on location, sometimes i try to deal with a big box retail store nearby
[09:40:58] <parsnip> usually having things delivered is a last resort for me
[09:41:04] <bpalmer> talismanick: perhaps just buy a laptop from the manufacturer or from a major store
[09:41:04] <humasect> apple.com
[09:41:15] <talismanick> parsnip: A month?! I contacted my credit card, and they told me if I want to cancel a transaction, it has to be within 30 days
[09:41:40] <TRS-80> PineBookPro (hopefully they make another batch soon)
[09:41:42] <talismanick> bpalmer: I looked at Amazon, but they're all at a huge markup compared to eBay
[09:41:48] <TRS-80> well, it's more like a netbook
[09:42:03] <codingquark> TRS-80: I am interested in their new endeavors with eInk devices
[09:42:04] <talismanick> TRS-80: I'd love to have a libre laptop, but let's be real: I need something more powerful
[09:42:11] <codingquark> And their odd little watch
[09:42:15] <parsnip> talismanick: a month? i mean i just set it to hold for a month, even if delivery is five days. then presumably i know when it arrives and pick it up
[09:42:15] <bpalmer> talismanick: I don't know precisely what models you're looking at, but sometimes you get what you pay for.
[09:42:50] <parsnip> i avoid ebay
[09:42:54] <TRS-80> talismanick: That's why I followed up that it's more like a netbook.  But depending on needs...  It could work?
[09:42:55] <bpalmer> I haven't trusted buying anything on ebay in a long time.
[09:43:00] <parsnip> i have too little experience with ebay
[09:43:08] <parsnip> amazon scares me enough, wild west
[09:43:10] <codingquark> Who's making pop!_os? They seem to have powerful hardware
[09:43:12] <bpalmer> I don't really trust amazon either.
[09:43:13] <talismanick> bpalmer: I settled on an HP Envy x360 2-in-1 because it fits my needs (I want something where I can do both math and programming)
[09:43:31] <humasect> i got a mac from amazon. it was not right model, and had damage, return and refund went well. (got one from local seller)
[09:43:36] <talismanick> bpalmer: Those are the only two stores I really know, soooo... what are the others?
[09:43:42] <parsnip> for example, amazon is not an authorized apple dealer, whereas bestbuy is
[09:43:54] * talismanick notes that no one has actually answered his question by listing another store, other than apple.com as a dumb joke
[09:43:57] <humasect> talismanick: do mean math and programming are diferent?
[09:43:59] <parsnip> and lo, i bought an iphone from amazon and it was shit
[09:44:15] <parsnip> returned it and figured out bestbuy was authorized
[09:44:17] <bpalmer> talismanick: if I go to hp.com, it looks like I can order it straight from them.
[09:44:23] <codingquark> parsnip: in .in, amzn is an authorized apple seller
[09:44:24] <codingquark> AFAIK
[09:44:26] <bpalmer> for $700
[09:44:27] <parsnip> (it was an old enough model that apple no longer carried it)
[09:44:38] <talismanick> humasect: Well, sure. I only write in LaTeX when I'm "done" with the real work, which I do on pen and paper. (but would like to write on a tablet, for convenience's sake)
[09:44:43] <parsnip> codingquark: doesn't apple list their authorized dealers?
[09:45:06] <parsnip> selling apple stuff does not mean authorized
[09:45:12] <humasect> talismanick: ahh, right =) 
[09:45:23] <talismanick> (I say "done" because it is sort of fun to reorder expressions with paredit-everywhere and sometimes last-minute devise something new)

[09:48:08] <parsnip> i spoke with amazon about some potential order, they said it would definitely come via amazon truck, and they would definitely leave it without a signature and just take a picture of it
[09:48:15] <parsnip> no option to require a signature, etc

[09:52:37] <dragestil_> for example, we have (define-key map "w" #'shr-maybe-probe-and-copy-url) in shr.el
[09:52:44] <bpalmer> codingquark: no, but talismanick said something about needing it soon to set up before going to campus.

[09:53:07] <parsnip> >    If you compile the above code, the anonymous function is also

[09:54:20] <talismanick> Speaking of which, the fact that people make brand commentary, etc - cringe
[09:54:29] <bpalmer> brand commentary?
[09:54:35] <talismanick> "haha, why are you still using that old Thinkpad"
[09:54:42] <codingquark> bpalmer: ah, I get it now. Since all computers are taking longer to assemble, they're taking longer than usual to deliver. I'm not sure about Indian supply chains about computers to be honest. Haven't ordered anything in a long time (friends haven't either, so hard to get first-hand data)
[09:55:12] <talismanick> bpalmer: Poor-shaming, in effect, since they don't understand why one might want to use a Thinkpad X200, other than being really poor
[09:55:57] <talismanick> How distasteful - never mind that I didn't use one for so long because I was poor by any means (on the contrary), but it speaks to a certain desperation on their part

[10:45:20] <acegallagher> With both modes enabled I'm getting 100% CPU usage and emacs lockup, it's really annoying. Also, in general, even without linum-mode outline-minor-mode uses ~20% of one 4.5Ghz core. 
[10:45:27] <acegallagher> I'm not an emacs wizard or anything like this, and I've run the profiler to confirm it, but I have no idea where to begin debugging it or submitting a bug report. Is anyone willing to point me in a direction?

[10:47:49] <acegallagher> it's almost as if outline-minor mode is hiding lines in a way that asks linum to draw all lines
[10:48:04] <bpalmer> acegallagher: if you're using an emacs 27 or somethin from git, look at display-line-numbers-mode instead of linum.
[10:48:19] <acegallagher> bpalmer: I'm using a self compiled git version with nativecomp
[10:48:27] <bpalmer> acegallagher: then definitely stop using linum
[10:49:02] <bpalmer> I think you're probably on the right trail; outline-minor-mode is doing a lot of selective displays

[10:54:45] <acegallagher> bpalmer: actually, the biggest difference to me is that the text isn't right justified
[10:54:53] <acegallagher> so with linum mode I have lines that look like 
[10:54:58] <acegallagher>  9 |
[10:55:00] <acegallagher> 10 |
[10:55:02] <acegallagher> 11 | 
[10:55:30] <acegallagher> including separator, but I don't think it's possible to doe this with display-line-numbers... or I'm too slow to figure it out
[10:55:59] *** Quits: Chep (chep@gateway/vpn/airvpn/chep) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[10:56:00] <bpalmer> so in display-line-numbers-mode, you see "  9|" ?

[10:56:25] <acegallagher> 9 
[10:56:26] <acegallagher> 10
[10:56:27] <acegallagher> 11
[10:56:35] <bpalmer> oh, hmm.
[10:56:41] <acegallagher> with no separator or anything, (using emacs -nw in the terminal)
[10:56:48] <ext0l> weird, that's not what i see in it, and i have zero customization (for d-l-n mode)

[11:03:14] <acegallagher> well, it's actually weirder to that than me
[11:03:18] <acegallagher> although maybe I'm picking nits
[11:03:44] <acegallagher> it is right justified, but somehow emacs changes the offset every time there's another digit in the line number
[11:04:29] <bpalmer> M-x customize-group RET display-line-numbers RET and you'll see some settings you can change that might affect this.
[11:04:41] <bpalmer> (There's a count of how many lines it needs to look at todecide on a width to use)
[11:05:04] <acegallagher> so the position of the first character in the code changes anytime you cross that threshold
[11:05:17] <acegallagher> which is really fucky for my brain with whitespace sensitive languages like python
[11:05:21] * acegallagher lowly scientist
[11:05:36] <acegallagher> bpalmer: great, thanks for giving me some pointers
[11:05:42] <ext0l> yeah you want... display-line-numbers-width
[11:06:16] <ext0l> set it to 5 and you're good as long as you have 99999 or fewer linus
[11:06:21] <ext0l> *lines
[11:07:00] <acegallagher> or I think width start it seems
[11:07:11] <acegallagher> hahahah. of course all these options exist, this is great
[11:07:20] <acegallagher> no idea why I didn't find that to begin with

[16:02:45] <mathsboy> hi, I'm using emacs more and more but find I am still quite reliant on my shell (i use iTerm on MacOS) for various programming related tasks, mainly running python files. When I do this with pymode It splits the screen into 3 windows with the file and term in 2 new windows. Then I find that getting back from term to the file is a bit cumbersome to C-c C-j C-x o to switch. So my question is how best to go about making a usable
[16:02:45] <mathsboy> environment for a simple programming workflow? Any tips on how to make shell/term cooperate a bit easier?
[16:03:10] *** Quits: ngz (~ngz@user/ngz) (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)

[16:04:43] <talismanick> When I used Emacs's windows, I went out of my way to add an extra keypress to that by way of ace-window
[16:04:44] <mathsboy> yeah that's what I would have expected, but it defaults to a line-mode or something so that C-x is sent as literal ctrl-x I think

[16:05:05] <talismanick> mathsboy: Oh, when switching from term!
[16:05:10] <talismanick> Consider using vterm
[16:05:26] <talismanick> https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm
[16:06:04] <talismanick> It's a terminal emulator library written in C, with an Emacs frontend; as a result, it feels like a "real" standalone terminal emulator, but properly embedded in Emacs
[16:06:08] <talismanick> and it doesn't have that problem
[16:06:36] <talismanick> mathsboy: That being said, I mentioned that I "used to use" Emacs's window system
[16:06:38] <bremner> or just carry on using an standalone terminal. It's worked for me for 30 years or so

[16:07:28] <talismanick> That's because I now use frames-only-mode (spawn all would-be windows as separate frames) and manage them as I would any other desktop window, with a tiling window manager
[16:07:46] <talismanick> If you don't want to go that far, though, just use ace-window

[16:10:42] <mathsboy> Do you  think it's worth using a WM right from the start? Or better to build up more basic emacs ability first?
[16:10:52] <mathsboy> REally great info btw - thank you so much!!
[16:11:25] <Plazma> holy shit yabai is going to change the game for me
[16:11:28] <talismanick> mathsboy: It sounds like you've already built some intuition for Emacs window keybindings
[16:11:32] <Plazma> i was using specatacle for mac fo ra while

[16:13:55] <talismanick> but I personally switched to frames-only because EXWM (which lets you manage all windows as Emacs windows, with a single frame being full-screen) was too clunky/buggy for me to use every day (still have it on an old, old Thinkpad, older than this one even)

[17:10:34] <rpav> pretty simple to mkfifo / cat and emacscleint in a subprocess
[17:10:40] *** Parts: pranavats (3fba1d1b34@jabberfr.org) ()
[17:11:21] <bpalmer> then in the emacsclient shell out to echo into the fifo. Live like a billionaire and spend processes without worry of the expense.
[17:12:38] <rpav> yeah a fifo might make this doable .. i guess this is actually a bit similar to what i did in scriptl, it just seems a bit silly to reimplement what emacsclient probably already has all the code for
[17:12:53] <rpav> but then it seemed a bit silly to do the same when there was slime, so what can you do

[17:14:38] <piyo> bpalmer: can emacs open and write to the fifo directly?
[17:14:49] <rpav> oh right, i had a whole client that opened a domain socket, heh .. maybe i can even reuse that
[17:14:55] <bpalmer> there probably is a better way to do this, but not one that occurs to me directly.
[17:15:17] <bpalmer> piyo: I don't think so; emacs normally wants to work with regular files.
[17:15:22] <rpav> piyo: for some value of direct, i think most file/socket/etc operations go through buffers in any case

[18:10:17] <TRS-80> mathsboy: I am also a fan of tiling window managers.  Lots of reasons but mainly because you can customize so much (like Emacs).  Difference being you don't want your WM to crash.  Which is the knock on that one Emacs WM (even though I find the concept fascinating).  I use i3 (-gaps) because it's known to be very fast/responsive and also stable.  But if you want a WM that uses (Common) Lisp, look
[18:10:19] <TRS-80> into StumpWM.  I tried that once, too, some time ago.  Now I use i3.  Check out their excellent docs.
[18:10:36] <grym> i3 army 
[18:10:48] <grym> it does what it says on the tin, and stays out of your way 
[18:10:56] <TRS-80> ^
[18:11:19] <TRS-80> in fact I never really think about it, unless discussing in IRC lol
[18:11:43] <rpav> piyo: probably but you could have an emacs instance specifically for that i suppose
[18:11:44] <talismanick> I use bspwm, mostly because it's shell-configurable and leaves tasks to other programs (like sxhkd for keys), meaning I can manage them as userspace runit services
[18:11:44] <akater[m]> I never had issues with EXWM.
[18:12:00] <talismanick> (runit being the init Void uses instead of SystemD)
[18:12:28] <grym> TRS-80: i spent about 3 days getting it tweaked right and now i leave it completely alone and it's great
[18:12:30] <talismanick> TRS-80: I had a lot of issues with StumpWM crashing with certain programs (like desktop Zoom, because the browser version wasn't working)
[18:12:34] <rpav> i was looking at i3 but settled on herbstluftwm .. most like-i'd-want-behavior i can find, though not perfect
[18:12:58] <talismanick> It works in Firefox again, but I had to use the desktop version (sandboxed, ofc) for a time

Which whill probably be different for everyone.  Your WM choice and config will likely be highly personal, not unlike your Emacs

[20:26:33] <rpav> piyo: pfft, this is the beginning of the format ~@R revolution
[20:27:10] <codingquark> Let's remove parenthesis from Elisp
[20:27:19] <piyo> rpav: is that Common Lisp, because I haven't been indoctrinated. I do (require 'cl-lib) a lot though.
[20:27:34] <rpav> let's replace lisp parentheses with moon phases
[20:27:44] <rpav> piyo: yeah
[20:27:45] <Demosthenex> ugh, anyone have an example init that accurately does tabs to indent and spaces to align for writing elisp?
[20:28:06] <hendursaga> There something I'm missing here? (defun redden-buffer () (interactive) (add-face-text-property (point-min) (point-max) '(:foreground "red") 'append))
[20:28:23] <piyo> Just like The Matrix: Resurrections, I think Emacs needs a reboot.
[20:28:24] <hendursaga> Nothing changes after running it.
[20:28:46] <rememberYou> Demosthenex does `(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)` doesn't work?

[20:29:00] <rpav> don't think it's a reboot though?
[20:29:15] <piyo> rpav: oh yeah maybe its not a reboot
[20:29:27] <GNUHacker> how can I set that emojify only show me unicode emoji?

[20:50:16] <contrapunctus> codingquark, rpav: I've got this wrapper around `cl-loop` to iterate over s-expressions in a (text) backend file. `cl-loop` has collect, append, count, sum, etc, which is why I like it best. But I've migrated my code to use CLOS, and the macro is not generic. (e.g. one kind of backend has plists, the other has plists wrapped in tagged lists...)

[21:02:08] <contrapunctus> rpav, oh. There's another issue I forgot about...passing `loop` clauses to a method that calls `cl-loop`.
[21:02:11] <rpav> i always tend to remember loop better than like dohash or whatever it is, and tend to have a more-well-visited bookmark
[21:02:33] <contrapunctus> the method will try to evaluate the arguments...

[23:30:08] <rpav> contrapunctus: i mean, if you do this with text, it relies a lot on the language; e.g. with python you can't do much besides maybe indentation width (and be careful there); with c/c++ you could reformat with like clang-format; with lisp .. you have a lot of style and linebreaking issues
[23:30:14] <contrapunctus> rpav, another thing I've been thinking about is storing s-expressions with excess spaces and all newlines removed. Then, display them indented as the programmer likes.

[23:36:35] <rpav> rather than facing the innumerable limitations of what can be parsed, and how to make that nice, and what everyone wants it to look like, you have expression objects that represent _the thing_, and presentation can be determined secondarily; ambiguity can be resolved directly rather than finding some textual way that will get read/parsed/etc "properly"

[23:41:52] <bpalmer> sure, storing what is essentially the AST is fine and all, but doesn't actually buy you all that much, because everybody interacting with it will inevitably interact with it in the form of tet.
[23:42:03] <bpalmer> It also sharply limits your ability to store incomplete programs.
[23:42:16] *** Joins: ec_ (~ec@gateway/tor-sasl/ec)
[23:42:28] <bpalmer> (Recall that most programs are not complete most of the time that somebody is editing them)
[23:42:54] <rpav> well presentation can be adjusted quite a bit .. plus it buys you things like, putting all your code in modular/database form _does_ help, because you can be like "this function has a FunctionCall(X, ...) expression" and build dependency ordering by analyzing the code

[23:43:44] <rpav> bpalmer: nah, just because you're editing ast-ish things doesn't mean you can't have like an IncompleteExpression or BrokenExpression(E, Other-Thing...) or whatever
[23:43:46] <technomancy> I've written a structural editor and representing incomplete programs has not been an issue
[23:44:05] <technomancy> well, it's not an issue when you're using the structural editor. it's an issue when you want to accept code written by people using inferior editors =)
[23:44:18] <rpav> what's nice is you don't need the compiler to tell you it's broken; the editor knows because you're working with actual types

[23:45:15] <bpalmer> rpav: but what is that buying you?
[23:45:17] <tsdh> When a regexp is matched, is there a function telling what's the largest matching subexpression/group?  `match-data' has that information, of course, but I don't want to build a list just to get a number...
[23:45:32] <rpav> bpalmer: you are no longer limited to what's expressible via deterministically-parseable text
[23:45:36] <bpalmer> the programmer knows it's broken because they haven't stopped typing; and it will fail to compile.
[23:45:57] <bpalmer> tsdh: when a regexp is matched, match-data is automatically built.
[23:46:11] <rpav> bpalmer: if you want to change the language, you're not stuck with compatibility issues, what you can shoehorn into the existing thing without breaking the other things .. you can make sometihng _behave_ how you want, then separately make it nice to _express_
[23:47:36] <rpav> you don't have issues like "well, we can't have (with-package 'foo ...) because the reader phase happens before macroexpansion" .. in reality you don't even _need_ it, you can tell the editor "in this section of code i want to see x_foo_blah as blah", and different people can see it however they want

[23:49:29] <rpav> bpalmer: the problem is programming languages evolve along lines of their textual parsing limitations
[23:49:32] <bpalmer> I don't necessarily *want* arbitrary per user transformation; math and programming languages are hard enough to understand with a shared dialect.
[23:49:49] <acegallagher> I'm having a weird emacs slowdown, when I scroll a lot and on redisplay
[23:49:55] <rpav> what if you could simply focus on making the most powerful possible language with no limitations on expressiveness?
[23:49:58] <acegallagher> when I profile it the slowdy traces to counsel-M-x running ivy-read
[23:50:06] <acegallagher> and I can't imagine why those things need to be called on redisplay
[23:50:14] <bpalmer> And, while writing, I don't care about anybody else being able to do things; I want my own things going on.

[23:51:37] <tsdh> bpalmer: No, not really.  Or, yes, it's built in some form but not in the list form returned by `match-data'.  A quick test suggests its much cheaper to test (match-beginning i) for i in 1..100 than (length (match-data)).
