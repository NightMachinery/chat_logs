[17:07:38] <flatcap> oh
[17:08:10] <dcpurton> I would say this is my fault. I bet it goes wrong in commit 93501456cfd2e9ff2dfab95773882639a044e023
[17:08:39] <flatcap> ah
[17:09:09] <flatcap> let me know if you need a hand

[17:11:07] <flatcap> good :-)
[17:11:33] <dcpurton> it's related too, because it doesn't correctly parse emails with groups

[19:58:33] <bookworm> yeah, re the bot thingy
[19:59:00] <flatcap> oh great!
[19:59:13] <flatcap> they have a number just like Issues and PRs
[19:59:17] <bookworm> don't get your hopes up too much... I've never touched graphql before
[19:59:45] <flatcap> ok, sure.  nor I :-)
[20:00:15] <flatcap> #3203 is a discussion
[20:00:24] <gahr> why graphql?
[20:00:41] <flatcap> that's github's new thing, rather than REST
[20:00:46] <gahr> ah
[20:00:52] <flatcap> it's more efficient for non-trivial queries
[20:01:10] <bookworm> not just GH, it's simply a better verision of REST (in theory)
[20:01:15] <flatcap> yeah
[20:01:20] <bookworm> several new-ish things use it, sr.ht too
[20:01:56] <gahr> I'm lagging behind on web tech
[20:02:03] <bookworm> as does everyone
[20:02:19] <flatcap> I was never on a cutting edge in the first place :-)
[20:02:42] <bookworm> else you'd have rewritten it in rust already :P
[20:03:02] <bookworm> scratch that, use zig or nim :P
[20:04:01] <gahr> $language_on_hype_in_2023
[20:04:23] <bookworm> but back to the topic, do you need a fancy prefix? Currently the bot listens to things like #1234, pr#1234, issue#i1234 etc, not that I particularly understand why it needs to do that
[20:05:27] <flatcap> just #NUMBER with whitespace or possibly punctuation around it
[20:05:42] <bookworm> then why on earth is that regex that complicated oO ?
[20:05:49] <flatcap> the bot already manages that much 
[20:05:51] <flatcap> dunno

[20:06:01] <bookworm> I pasted it abofe
[20:06:04] <bookworm> above*
[20:06:14] <bookworm> that's where I got the regex from :)
[20:06:28] <flatcap> oh, _that's_ what you're referring to!
[20:07:11] <flatcap> 6f5b01ff: Add support for user/repo#num
[20:07:16] <flatcap> news to me
[20:07:40] <bookworm> that I even understand... what I don't understand is the issue/pr prefix that is optionally allowed

[20:08:24] <bookworm> see? It even doesn't do what you'd expect
[20:08:34] <bookworm> as that certainly ain't a PR

[21:20:42] <gahr> nice
[21:21:12] <gahr> does it work with regexes? Can I list all issues in all repos by */*#[0-9]+ ?
[21:21:13] <gahr> :D
[21:22:55] <bookworm> with graphql? Well you can enumerate everything, paged. So that part is actually not that bad
[21:25:12] <gahr> I meant, does the bot eat that :) but that was a joke

[22:18:45] <bluejaypop> hello, if I want to use different gpg keys from two mutt configs, is it just to set the gpg_sign_as="0x...." in the different config?
