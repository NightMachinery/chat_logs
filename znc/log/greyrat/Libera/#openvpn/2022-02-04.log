[11:22:36] <MaxFrames> hello. I'm a bit rusted so can you guys help me check out if the following assumptions are true (openvpn community edition, certification authority machine running on debian)?
[11:23:24] <MaxFrames> 1) after creating the certification authority, the ca's private key (ca.key) is found in /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/private (and only in that path)
[11:24:08] <MaxFrames> 2) ca.key should if possible be stored offline i.e. removed from that path and put on any kind of offline medium
[11:24:57] <MaxFrames> 3) if operations have to be performed that require ca.key, ca.key should be copied back to the above mentioned path for the duration of the operations
[11:49:23] <MaxFrames> also 4): the certificate requests for clients are .csr or .req?
[11:51:02] <peder> MaxFrames: if you care about ca.key, I think it would be much better to have the whole ca-part on another host, and just copy the non-private parts you actually need on to the openvpn server
[11:51:39] <peder> and let that host be offline most of the time ;)
[11:52:48] <MaxFrames> but as an immediate measure, should I take ca.key from that path and store it offline? and copy it back if I need it for some operation?
[11:54:31] <peder> depends on how paranoid you are, I peronally wouldn't bother.  Either just keept it all on the server, or have the ca on a seperate host
[11:57:22] <MaxFrames> I'm also looking for the certificate signing requests of the few clients; I can't find them as *.csr, but I do have a /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/reqs directory with *.req files for the clients; are these the csr's?
[11:58:45] <peder> yes, they are

[11:59:26] <MaxFrames> thanks
[11:59:33] <peder> and the certs ar both in pki/issued, and pki/certs_by_serial
[11:59:42] <peder> and the keys in pki/private
[11:59:51] <MaxFrames> got it, thanks
[12:00:17] <peder> and all issued certs are listed in pki/index.txt
[12:01:06] <peder> if you ever try to issue a cert the same CN again, you need to remove the old one from that file i think...
[12:01:59] <peder> at least i had to do that a few days ago :)
[12:04:24] <MaxFrames> for the clients, I only have .req files... but for the server, I have both a .csr and a .req
[12:05:40] <MaxFrames> the contents of the csr and req files for the servers are different; it's not the same file with a different extension
[12:08:15] <peder> not sure... i don't think i have any of them on my system...
[12:08:42] <MaxFrames> they're normally not needed after the cert and keys have been issued, right?

[16:08:39] <rob0> I like to keep the CSR for when the CA expires.
[16:09:35] <rob0> or, same idea, when the cert expires, assuming it's sooner than the CA expiration
[16:10:06] <rob0> you can reissue the same cert using the CSR
