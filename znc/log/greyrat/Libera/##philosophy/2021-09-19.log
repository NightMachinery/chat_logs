[00:31:13] <dfcnvt> Is there a Venn diagram, a layer, or a mind-map that involves a categorical communication...?
[00:32:59] <dfcnvt> Err, like - there's panel communication, formal vs informal, chit-chat, personal to professional, manipulation, speaking in honesty, educational use through dialogues....
[00:33:05] <dfcnvt> Err, probably a bad example.
[00:33:40] <dfcnvt> Basically, I'm trying to "capture" what everyone is capable of when speaking or involving communication.
[00:36:22] <dfcnvt> Just so, I can practice in some different space if there's a different mode of communication....I don't want to talk or think like a kid if I'm at work...Or even so if I'm acting professional, it won't go well with family member when they want to get informal.  I'm feeling very limited to what communiction is capable of.

[03:44:57] <coeus> man, that plank is suck a %&@#ing asshole
[03:45:32] <coeus> he needs to stay in ##politics, like he even knows what philosophy is
[03:46:33] <coeus> the very word philosophy comes from being enlightened to the truth about the world around you
[03:48:21] <coeus> that %@#& thinks that truth is subjective, based on the collectivism
[03:48:33] <coeus> &@#% him!
[03:48:57] <kish> don't be angry :(
[03:49:37] <coeus> but Kish is different
[03:49:46] <coeus> at least he has an open mind
[03:51:22] <coeus> Kish doesn't believe in using deductions to create theories though, or does he?
[03:51:49] <kish> well I do
[03:51:56] <kish> that's how theories are created i believe
[03:52:00] <coeus> Kish a theory isn't a real thing, it's just something you use to explain what it is you are looking at
[03:52:07] <kish> but clearly it doesn't always lead to truth of a matter
[03:52:50] <coeus> kish, truth is based on what you can prove or disprove, it's based on material objects
[03:53:10] <kish> there are esoteric means to gain truthful knowleddge
[03:54:05] <coeus> if you can prove the chair your sitting on is a real chair, then you arrive at the truth
[03:54:16] <coeus> that what you are sitting on is a real chair
[03:55:20] <coeus> if I have a theory, I don't even know if what I'm referring to is a real thing unless I can prove it's a real thing
[03:55:35] <coeus> can I prove the chair is made of atoms?
[03:55:40] <coeus> no
[03:55:47] <coeus> so it's theoretical
[03:57:54] <coeus> but if I said that I examined the atoms in the chair and determined that it was a real chair based the comparison I made with atoms from a real chair, then I have not proven that it's a real chair, just that it has the same atoms as a real chair
[03:58:42] <coeus> however, some would argue that it's enough to prove you are looking at the same thing under certain circumstances
[03:59:09] <coeus> those circumstances are what lead to a theory
[04:01:48] <causative> you cannot ever "prove" anything with 100% certainty, especially when talking about the physical world
[04:02:01] <causative> your senses could always be deceived, or even your sense of reason could be malfunctioning temporarily
[04:02:13] <causative> the best you can hope for is high confidence
[04:02:31] <ldlework> I think therefore I am
[04:02:34] <causative> you think you see a chair - what if you're having a stroke, and hallucinating the chair?
[04:03:14] <ldlework> When it comes to epistemology we take on mental phenomena, per se, into our ontology and each epistemological framework goes from there
[04:04:14] <causative> every machine can malfunction, including when that machine is only inspecting its own state
[04:04:21] <causative> your brain is a machine
[04:04:44] <ldlework> That doesn't change anything
[04:04:48] <coeus> well kish, so do you still think that it's truth we need?
[04:05:05] <ldlework> That your brain is a machine is actually a warrant only available once you have taken a given epistemology like externalist reliabilism
[04:05:18] <coeus> because that's not the way our brains process information, it's not based on truth it's based on evidence
[04:05:23] <ldlework> That we grant mental phenomena ontological status is far prior to knowing anything about the brain
[04:05:32] *** Joins: ttree (~ttree0@c-73-239-62-159.hsd1.wa.comcast.net)
[04:05:46] <causative> well, *do* you take the position of externalist reliabilism?
[04:05:55] <I_Am_M00t> truuuth = belief hurrrrr
[04:05:56] <ldlework> oh of course, most contemporary humans do
[04:06:08] <causative> so you do warrant that the brain is a machine?
[04:06:14] <ldlework> absolutely
[04:06:24] <ldlework> and all that stuff you said about gettier cases, and friends, is all true
[04:06:33] <causative> I didn't mention gettier problems
[04:06:53] <ldlework> i just mean the fact that you can't prove things because it comes down to perceptual problems
[04:06:57] <causative> but if you agree that the brain is a machine, then you must also agree that it can sometimes fail, no matter what it is doing
[04:07:19] <causative> so we cannot ever rationally trust it 100%
[04:07:20] <ldlework> yes, but the proposition that contains the existence claim for mental phenomena is not predicated on that
[04:07:25] <kish> coeus, truth is very important
[04:08:04] <causative> I believe mental phenomena exist, but there are philosophers who claim they don't (eliminativists)
[04:08:15] <causative> can I be 100% sure I am right and they are wrong?
[04:08:19] <coeus> kish, Jesus was the son of God, he spoke the truth, but does that mean I can prove it?
[04:08:20] <coeus> no
[04:08:26] <causative> can you rationally be 100% sure you are right and they are wrong?
[04:08:32] <ldlework> causative: They only claim certain kinds of mental states don't exist
[04:08:37] <coeus> you just make a decision to believe that it's the truth
[04:08:40] <ldlework> Not categorically
[04:08:43] <causative> yeah, mental states like *consciousness*
[04:09:08] <ldlework> No, like belief and desire. They don't reject phenomenologically the existence of mental states.
[04:09:23] <stiltrumpelskin> is the statement "my brain might be malfunctioning" true with certainty?
[04:09:41] <causative> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliminative_materialism#Qualia
[04:09:41] <ro-bot-o> [url] Eliminative materialism - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[04:09:48] <causative> "Eliminativists, such as Daniel Dennett and Georges Rey, respond by rejecting qualia."
[04:10:04] <coeus> Kish, truth is something you make the decision to believe
[04:10:25] <ldlework> Yes, they're compatibilists who believe that instead of some epiphenomena that you instead have brain machinery that compells a kind of behavior in self report
[04:10:28] <ldlework> I agree with Dennett
[04:10:36] <causative> you reject qualia?
[04:10:44] <ldlework> Yes, I take Graziano
[04:10:49] <ldlework> Attention Schema Theory
[04:11:04] <ldlework> In a bayesian sense of "it's the best thing I've heard"
[04:11:07] <causative> but you still take mental phenomena as prior to any theory about the brain?
[04:11:22] <causative> what mental phenomena do you take as prior, if not qualia?
[04:11:43] <coeus> how the heck am I supposed to prove that it's a real chair I'm sitting on if all I have to go on is an examination of the chair itself, a way to differentiate the chair from everything else in the world based on deductions?
[04:11:51] <coeus> so it's a theory then not the truth
[04:12:03] <stiltrumpelskin> first you must define 'real' coeus lol
[04:12:17] <coeus> yes, you have to prove it's real, I agree
[04:12:29] <stiltrumpelskin> first you have to say what real means
[04:12:53] <stiltrumpelskin> i think 'real' and 'truth' are intertwined concepts
[04:13:09] <coeus> well something real means that you prove it actually exists
[04:13:35] <ldlework> causative: the p-zombie, while having no magical internal experience, has whatever is required to produce the self-report of it. the p-zombie, through sheer cognitive functions alone, reach the same epistemological justification, even if they live in a universe where such epiphenomena are impossible, and we know they don't have it
[04:13:41] <ldlework> the challenge is in realizing we are the p-zombies
[04:14:07] <ldlework> when you take seriously this idea, then what mental phenomena really are has to take an interpretation that doesn't mean some epiphenomenal theatre
[04:14:50] <causative> so you're saying you're a p-zombie, who has no qualia or "magical internal experience," and that you take as prior your model of qualia, (which is not actually subjective qualia)?
[04:15:29] <ldlework> causative: you must wring out any notion of magical epiphenomena theatre of quality from the strawman/steelman for it to be coherent
[04:15:42] <ldlework> clearly the thing we're taking as prior is no longer the contents of an epiphenomenal theatre
[04:15:58] <causative> but it's the "model" of an epiphenomenal theatre?
[04:16:00] <ldlework> but rather something more akin to mechanistic i-am-a-strange-loop kind of situations
[04:16:00] *** Quits: TheHermann (~TheHerman@gateway/tor-sasl/thehermann) (Quit: Leaving)
[04:16:50] <causative> am I correct in representing your view?
[04:17:02] <ldlework> causative: that's one way to think of it, if you take seriously the brain can model all sorts of phenomena that can't actually physically exist, but integrate and takes those models seriously
[04:17:09] <ldlework> such as the experiments on extravision
[04:17:30] <causative> well of course the brain can model all sorts of phenomena that can't actually physically exist
[04:17:35] <causative> it can model Harry Potter, can't it?
[04:17:42] <ldlework> yeah but there's a deeper sense
[04:17:43] <causative> or Euclidean space
[04:17:55] <ldlework> when it comes to harry potter, it doesn't have bearing on our judgements or estimations of physical systems
[04:18:05] <causative> it can
[04:18:35] <ldlework> the brains reuse of motion processing cortexes to track social gaze and attention has testable effects on people's judgements of physical systems
[04:18:43] <causative> for example, suppose an avid Harry Potter fan says, "I think of myself as a Slytherin."  If you have a model of Harry Potter in your mind, you can use it to infer something about that person's personality
[04:18:45] <ldlework> the brain actually models attention as a force that can affect things
[04:19:10] <causative> so that has a definite bearing on our judgment of a physical system (the HP fan)
[04:19:13] <ldlework> causative: even if so, it's beating down a path that is only tangentially related, we're losing the thread of epistemology
[04:19:51] <ldlework> the point here is that the brain has very low level, let's call them "fanciful metaphors" for which it invents then takes seriously
[04:20:07] <ldlework> here's one thing to consider, take empathetic simulation of the subjective states of other creatures
[04:20:12] <causative> fine, so you have a model of an epiphenomenal theatre.  Now, this model can be wrong, can't it?  It is conceivable that the model could have a few atoms out of place, so it gives a wrong answer?
[04:20:18] <ldlework> look at the evolution of the brain as a system
[04:20:45] <ldlework> the brain evolutionarilly has no "epistemological" access to know that other brains have subjecive experience, and yet the brain has a deeply evolved system around this assumption
[04:21:22] <ldlework> we treat other social objects specially and model them with a bunch of information, not just gaze but a panoply of features representing our judgement of their internal social attitudes and so on
[04:21:43] <ldlework> but again, in a developmental sense, the brain could never know those other objects have those features internall
[04:22:11] <ldlework> It just guesses, invents a model wholesale, and starts taking it seriously, whether or not the phenomenology of other objects having true subjective experiences is possible in the metaphysics we grant
[04:22:45] <ldlework> It's far more likely that other objects don't have internal experience, and this is just a useful social modeling tool, just as the brain's reification of extravision is
[04:23:03] <causative> ok, but how do you answer my question?
[04:23:18] <ldlework> causative: it can absolutely be wrong about this or that, but not that something is happening at all
[04:23:39] <ldlework> for this system to be wrong about a thing is to say that it's working at the level of analysis we care about
[04:23:50] <ldlework> in the cartesian sense
[04:24:01] <causative> well, a computer that is modeling a container port could be wrong about whether a container is there or not, couldn't it?
[04:24:15] <causative> or whether a ship is unloading or not
[04:24:18] <ldlework> yes, but if it reports anything at all, then you have the phenomena required
[04:24:26] <ldlework> and this is more of an introspective model
[04:25:02] <ldlework> Graziano's theory is rooted in the temporo-parietal-junction which specifically is an area of the brain that self-models the contents of attention
[04:25:13] <causative> so it's an inventory system for the rest of the brain
[04:25:16] <ldlework> a module that basically tries to model what you attend to, to predict what you'll attend to in the future
[04:25:19] <causative> inventory systems can be wrong all the time
[04:25:40] <ldlework> it's a "schematic" of the system that is the bandwidth comptition that ocurrs in the brain
[04:25:54] <ldlework> like in a given second, given the brain is a computer of finite volume, it can only do so much computation in that period
[04:26:15] <ldlework> and so the brain has a system of emergent competition, and the TPJ basically draws cartoons of what goes on in that competition
[04:26:20] <ldlework> so as to predict who will win in the future
[04:26:36] <ldlework> pathologies to the TPJ are associated with varieties of clinical neglect, like blindsight
[04:27:10] <ldlework> like where a patient swears they are blind, that in the theatre, no visual performance is taking place, but you can arrange tests to prove that the patient's eyes and visual cortex are usefully integrating and cognating upon visual information
[04:27:20] <ldlework> there's a whole spectrum of neglectful pathologies
[04:28:11] <ldlework> graziano contends that you don't have an epiphenomena of subjective experience, but rather, you have something akin to the brain's insistence that social gaze emparts physical force, and that other social objects have an internal experience, but for itself
[04:28:45] <causative> so the original topic was epistemology - you were saying "I think therefore I am" and I take it this was meant as an example of a claim rationally made with 100% certainty?
[04:28:55] <ldlework> if the brain were to gain an ability to enumerate external objects, then eventually identify some of those objects as being social, requiring gaze tracking and deep empathetic modeling, then at some point it would inevitably encounter itself as an object that these conditions are true of and begin such a model for itself
[04:29:34] <ldlework> it draws into the evolutionary question of which came first -- empathetic social modeling, or subjective experience
[04:29:57] <ldlework> did the brain reuse empathetic modeling of a phenomena it invented for other social objects on itself, like extravision
[04:30:24] <ldlework> or did it extend a notion of subjective experience to social objects, since it identified it in itself
[04:30:29] <ldlework> i think that's a fascinating question
[04:31:04] <ldlework> causative: i suppose if i'm being as fair as possible, it's more of a presupposition rather than something with a prior warrant
[04:31:53] <ldlework> like no textbook or course on epistemology starts with a justification of mental phenomena because it is the amputated legs upon which all the epistemological frameworks equally stand
[04:32:14] <stiltrumpelskin> the fact that we have experience allows us to say with 100% certainty that something exists
[04:32:31] <stiltrumpelskin> i will also say with 100% certainty that i can make mistakes
[04:32:41] <causative> so you could have made a mistake in saying something exists
[04:32:56] <stiltrumpelskin> nope
[04:33:14] <stiltrumpelskin> because the fact that i process something already implies it
[04:33:22] <ldlework> stiltrumpelskin: right an in the most brutal of materialist takes, it's not the epiphenomenal characterization we usually have of mental states that we care about, but rather, "that something happened" in the causal sense, to stir notions whatsoever that gives us the proposition that somethings there at all
[04:33:51] <causative> that makes sense to me, stiltrumpelskin , but just because something makes sense to me does not mean it is true
[04:34:02] <causative> because I could have only the false impression of understanding
[04:34:07] <ldlework> causative: right but that equally applies to all propositions
[04:34:10] <causative> it does
[04:34:12] <ldlework> which undermines the project in the first place
[04:34:20] <causative> in what way?
[04:34:31] <ldlework> and can be taken as vacuous and unnecesary skeptical rhetoric
[04:34:41] <ldlework> causative: the project of reason, that there's progress to be made at all
[04:34:49] <causative> it's not vacuous, human mistakes are very practically relevant

[04:35:13] <ldlework> for all discourses, any interlocutor can at any time say "but we could only have the false impression of understanding" and add nothing of value unique to the unique situation at hand
[04:35:22] <ldlework> it's vacuous in it's universal applicability
[04:35:25] <causative> well, I do believe there is progress to be made, but a rational person must also allow that there is some small chance that there is not
[04:35:35] <causative> it doesn't add a *lot* of value - except to someone who would deny it
[04:35:40] <causative> it can go unsaid as long as it is understood by all
[04:36:11] <ldlework> right and among known philosophers in a philosopher context, can only be said to demonstrate some kind of high-minded openess or skepticism
[04:36:25] <ldlework> rather than some pertient lever
[04:36:28] <causative> but some people go around making a sharp divide between what is "proved" (empirically) and what is only "theorized" - as if these were not simply differences in degree
[04:36:48] <ldlework> All is reduced to rational appeal
[04:36:56] <ldlework> it's true

[04:41:14] <ldlework> i think dennett would contend with your notion that the "whole of us" can be equated with the narrow model that comprises the theatre
[04:41:26] <ldlework> if you mean sense data, then he'll agree
[04:41:42] <ldlework> but qualia is an artifact of that narrow homonculis phenomena, the summary report
[04:42:01] <ldlework> surely, "you" in the totalistic material agentitive device sense, are "aware" of all the sensory data your take on
[04:42:05] <causative> how do you know it's not also in every other part of the brain, just not reported?
[04:42:13] <ldlework> in the sense that you as a device are causally disturbed or impinged by that information
[04:42:24] <ldlework> causative: that's the point i'm making
[04:42:36] <ldlework> the summary report appears to leave out things that "we are not aware of"
[04:42:50] <ldlework> but surely, the brain as a physical system is impinged by all perceptual information it encounters
[04:42:55] <causative> but those things could also consist of qualia
[04:43:05] <ldlework> whether those causal changes make it into the summary report and articulated as qualia is something else entirely
[04:43:21] <ldlework> pizza time, ttyl
[04:44:12] <causative> I'm trying to describe a distinction between what is *reported* as qualia, and what actually is subjective experience - that we might have experiences that are legitimately qualia, that simply do not make it to the summary report
[04:45:25] <causative> if you want to be a monist, for reasons of Occam's razor, it makes more sense to say "all is qualia" than to say "all is non-qualia"; because we already have qualia in front of us
[04:46:57] <causative> and this can be compatible with all of physics - not to say the world is a dreamland or anything like that, we still have subatomic particles that act according to mathematical rules
[04:47:58] <causative> it's just, why suppose two substances? the eliminativist perspective does not appeal to me, because it contradicts my experience
[04:49:31] <causative> you only need one substance, but it can be *both* the qualia we directly experience, and the objects we indirectly infer in the world
[04:50:08] <causative> and, I agree that AST is a reasonable model for the likely mechanism of self-reported consciousness
[04:50:36] <causative> but there is no need to assume that what is self-reported is just a fiction

[04:53:19] <causative> the mechanism can coincide with the actual truth, as we assume often happens for many other mental mechanisms, e.g. a person's model of the external world
