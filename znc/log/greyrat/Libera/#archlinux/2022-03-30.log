[01:09:44] <Fichte> for anyone interested, I solved the problem by wiping my boot partition and installing Linux and the bootloader again (grub here) 
[01:10:11] <conr> is there any way to see an old grub config?
[01:10:30] <conr> i need to define my args for kvm
[01:10:36] <Betal> topcat001: thanks for pointing the new kernel would fix the issue! working great \o
[01:10:43] <topcat001> \o/
[01:11:53] <Ghosthree3> conr: grub's boot config is created using the /etc/default/grub config when you run `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`, the /etc/default/grub file shouldnt have been changed from when you edited it last
[01:12:10] <Ghosthree3> just grub-mkconfig again maybe?
[01:12:46] <topcat001> I like running LTS (it's a slightly irrational thing I guess) and waiting for that to get the fix. If heftig does not patch linux-lts then it will be here next week :)

[10:18:51] <Murray7501> slimbo: just slightly more involved to get my ip
[10:18:54] <mpan> And “obscuring” is not “preventing exposure”. It just makes one have to do one more step to obtain your IP address. And usually gives you psychic comfort of believing you are somehow more safe. In particular it does not affect port scans, as they are hardly related to your activity on IRC.

[12:43:13] <wonko-the-sane> In fact you setup and even more isolated ssh server than that. It goes as follows: sshd runs on a box which accepts a one time connection from its gateway (on which tor runs the .onion) that one time connection sets up an ssh tunnel to transport the traffic from the onion to 127.1:22 on the isolated box, then you can drop _all_ INPUT traffic from the isobox, the ESTABLISHED connection persists. 
[12:43:19] <wonko-the-sane> It's bit of a hindrance, and certainly slows down an attacker (who by hypothesis managed to get a shell) who of course can still exfiltrate data over stdio, but you can severely rate limit that and or have the gateway drop the tunnel connection on certain conditions.

[15:22:55] <Foxboron> It's notes on urandom is outdated with recent changes from Jason
[15:23:03] <jonathon> roxlu: that just sounds like standard NFS sync writing - the file is unavailable/locked until it's written to disk on the server end. i don't think there's an easy fix for that; one way would be to set async (and risk data loss), removing remote file locking might help (again risking data loss), or using some sort of local cache/hot-warm setup with write-through to the NFS drive (slightly more involved but should work), final thought is maybe fscache would

[17:46:19] <Bayes> oh so I need headers that are "optional" for dkms, hence why pacman don't fetch them
[17:46:53] <MacGyver> Yeah, because pacman can't figure out for you which kernels you want the module to be built for.
[17:47:00] *** Joins: spare (~p5ox5sc2a@user/spareproject)

[17:47:27] <Bayes> so many obscure things I'm learning from you today
[17:48:05] <Scimmia> for this, the #1 takeaway should be to always read what pacman tells you

[17:49:59] <Bayes> until MacGyver explained that it couldn't figure out which one I wanted, which isn't spelled out by pacman

[21:26:05] <Edu4rdSHL> Ghosthree3, technically it's a proxy and no a mirror as-is, it redirect the requests to another mirror, then caches the data and serve it to you using their CDN.

[22:39:33] <michelesr> I have a techincal question for you guys: if you use iptables to set a DNAT rule to e.g. forward an ip or a port, and then you open a TCP session, and after that you remove the rule, will the session persist? Is linux stateful in that sense?

[22:41:15] <Arsimael> whoops
[22:41:21] <tusko> It will just take each packet as it comes, either your response will fail to arrive (most likely) or it could complain that you can't send

[22:42:02] <michelesr> I'm asking this (and pardon if it's out of scope for this channel) because I'm trying to troubleshoot load balancers on Kubernetes, which uses iptables DNAT rules, and I've noticed than HTTP requests keep going through even after iptables is updated.. or at least that was my perception
[22:42:29] <tusko> ew
[22:42:30] *** Joins: progandy (~progandy@user/progandy)
[22:43:00] <michelesr> to be more specific, an external load balancer in the cloud uses a port on the node, and that port is magically mapped (through iptables nat) to some container ip and port
[22:43:22] <michelesr> when the system requires the endpoint to be changed, that dnat rule will either change the destination or be removed altogether
[22:43:38] <michelesr> but I think open TCP sessions (e.g. HTTP keep-alive) keeps going to the old endpoint

[23:00:56] <MrElendig> systemd tend to be a bit cranky without dbus
[23:01:23] <Bayes> any thoughts why k s h r doesn't work but all others do? my computer beeps at me when I press the h key while typing that pattern http://ix.io/3TRU
