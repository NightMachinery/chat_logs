[20:47:20] <c355e3b> Helmholtz: Part of the reason why we are so attractive to spam is because we 1. move slowly and 2. have an audience which can drive large technical investments
[20:47:36] <c355e3b> At one point, it was something like 10k USD worth of ad-words spend to be on the front page
[20:50:23] <Helmholtz> so companies try to push their links to first pages of HN and lobsters because the audience are engineers?
[20:51:46] <pushcx> Unfortuately, yeah. We've had 'voting rings' where they invite set up accounts under 4-15 employee emails and then whenever they write a blog post all those accounts log in to upvote it.
[20:51:56] <pushcx> 'invite/set up accounts'
[20:52:17] <epilys> also, the fact that they do it doesn't mean it works. It's just that they think it will
[20:52:44] <Helmholtz> MFW I just realized I was doing free advertisements in HN...but I usually post cool FOSS stuff
[20:53:41] <Helmholtz> I thought nobody cared about these circles
[20:53:45] <Helmholtz> *nobody in finance/hr
[20:54:14] <pushcx> Ideally it's a gift culture. They write something really educational, or release a useful tool, or otherwise give something to everyone. And then we reward that with attention that may lead to revenue. Everyone's happy.

[20:56:34] <epilys> Helmholtz, people are suspicious because of history of abuse
[20:57:05] <pushcx> It's not explicitly stated anywhere, but when someone's only involvement is to post and comment on their own stuff it comes off as exploitative. They're only trying to use Lobsters to drive attention to their thing, they're not participating in the community. This often goes along with making extra accounts to push things up the page.

[22:28:13] <kaine2> it's so annoying...

[22:28:26] <kaine2> any way to stop it?
[22:29:06] <kaine2> some searching yielded answers of how to create folders, not how to prevent it
