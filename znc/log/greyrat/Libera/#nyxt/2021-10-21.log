[18:50:35] <jmercouris> xaltsc: a second status bar may be added sure, but you’ll have to override some internal functions
[18:50:56] <jmercouris> What this means is that there is no guarantee that your config will continue to work based on the semantic version meanings
[18:51:29] <jmercouris> In other words, a x.y.z change where Z is the change could break your config even
[18:51:53] <jmercouris> For some hints about where to look, check out the buffer class in gtk.lisp

[22:22:13] <uniquepointer> that means it can be put in any home/configuration.nix
[22:22:17] <uniquepointer> and called directly
[22:23:51] <waleee> did you try changing NYXT_INTERNAL_QUICKLISP=false to NYXT_SUBMODULES=false?
[22:24:26] <waleee> (I don't have the space for nix on this machine)
[22:24:32] <uniquepointer> i tried nyxt_submodules false
[22:24:55] <uniquepointer> it throws a bunch of errors because it expects the system to have it
[22:25:09] <uniquepointer> and it leaves us at the mercy of nix again
[22:25:15] <uniquepointer> let me try nyxt_internal_ql
[22:26:22] <waleee> that's weird. Are you sure it has fetched the revision you specificed and aren't reusing the old one from the cache?
[22:27:22] <uniquepointer> uh
[22:27:28] <uniquepointer> i been working with latest commit
[22:27:34] <uniquepointer> which reminds me i gotta update it so let me try again

[22:30:01] <uniquepointer> i try not to refetch much btw, because it takes a LONG time, i only do it when i know i have to
[22:32:13] <waleee> uniquepointer: nix-collect-garbage should happily delete it if you are building it with nix build
[22:33:16] <waleee> * caveat that you should delete the result dir first
[22:33:30] <uniquepointer> oh ye i know
[22:33:50] <uniquepointer> im a pro at this point 8-D nix has shot me in the back and foot and stabbed me so much i know it
[22:33:56] <uniquepointer> (but not really a pro)
[22:35:38] <uniquepointer> ftr that was not supposed tob e a penis
[22:35:39] <uniquepointer> LMAO

[22:36:46] <waleee> you dont't happen to remember or save the exact error when using NYXT_SUBMODULES=false?
[22:37:18] <waleee> because it really should only be in an old version of the nyxt makefile
[22:38:16] <waleee> * NYXT_INTERNAL_QUICKLISP should only be in ...
