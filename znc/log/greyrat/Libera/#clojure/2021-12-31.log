[21:11:55] <tatsumaru> I understand the difference between first and rest I think, but in this case I am looking up the same keyword in a map, only switching the place of the argument.
[21:11:56] <Para> Behaviorally yes, but I guess in semantics it differs :)
[21:12:33] <Para> Map is also a function, but so is keyword, and they're both `get` underneath. It's handy.
[21:13:53] <tatsumaru> {} is also get?
[21:14:11] <Para> As per convention the `(:a m)` is used quite often, and for remaining cases `(get m :a)` since the latter also supports optional default value.
[21:14:28] <Para> Yeah it's just a convenience thing added in to all(?) collections.
[21:15:40] <Solid> Para: afaik for maps `(:kw m def)` also works to specify a default vlaue
[21:16:20] <tatsumaru> so when I do (:a m) and (m :a) how does clj know which is the argument and which is the literal if both are get?
[21:16:22] <Para> Solid: Might be, and probably is so :)
[21:17:25] <Para> That's just normal polymorphism, isn't it? :) Different things have different implementations.
[21:18:00] <Para> Both do implement IFn, but the implement varies; for maps the logic is that map is "a function of keys to values", for keyword it's really just "lookup yourself from given argument"
[21:18:13] <Para> *implementation, man CLJS mushes my brain

[23:58:26] <seabass> Hello! I'm having some trouble with deps.edn and namespaces. My deps.edn file is {:paths ["src"]} (that's it!), and I have a file src/game.clj which starts with (ns game).
[23:59:02] <seabass> unfortunately, when I try to view any symbol in the REPL, I get 'no such namespace: game'
[23:59:23] <seabass> am I missing anything here? Any help would be much appreciated; thanks!
