[00:42:49] <edman007__> Hey, so I'm trying to (via libavcodec) decode HEVC and encode it to H264, my HW does not support HEVC, but it does support H264, so I'm trying to decode it and then filter it to fix the pixel format, and then encode that in HW (after using hwmap to upload it to HW)
[00:43:22] <edman007__> my problem is I get a warning that I used a deprecated pixel format and the encoded video is just black with a big vertical green bar
[00:44:14] <edman007__> investigating, I set a function to pick a HW compatible SW format that I gave to the HEVC decoder, and YUVJ420P is the only SW format I can pick
[00:44:19] *** edman007__ is now known as edman007
[00:44:37] <edman007> which swscale says it deprecated
[00:45:07] <edman007> and I guess proceeds assuming it's YUV420P and I guess that's why I see nothing?
[00:45:37] <BtbN> Just be aware that doing that whole process will butcher the quality quite a bit, unless you throw quite a lot of bitrate at it.
[00:45:48] <BtbN> I guess you want to play it on something that doesn't handle HEVC?
[00:47:27] *** Parts: Hello71 (~Hello71@wireguard/contributor/hello71) ()
[00:47:39] <edman007> BtbN, yea, just want to be able to accept a HEVC stream and save it to H264 because it's really getting played in a web browser so H264 is the only real option, but this is actually a security cam thing I'm writing, so it's more of support all the options regardless of the quality of actually doing it
[00:48:29] <BtbN> Was also more thinking of the hwenc
[00:48:33] <edman007> I'm trying to figure out why it doesn't seem to actually work...
[00:48:36] <BtbN> most hwencs, specially old ones, kinda suck
[00:49:20] <edman007> BtbN, yea, like I said security camera stuff...I expect to be handing a lot of video streams and don't actually have the CPU power to do it in SW
[00:49:39] <BtbN> What actually is the hardware encoder?
[00:50:19] <edman007> Radeonsi/r600 (it's old...I know)
[00:50:34] <edman007> that's what I
[00:50:39] <edman007> *i'm testing with
[00:50:49] <BtbN> That thing has an encoder?
[00:51:25] <edman007> yea, for h264, mpeg2, & vc1
[00:52:00] <edman007> and I already tested H264 HW and reencode via HW that works fine...
[00:52:30] <edman007> though as you said, quality isn't great
[00:52:59] <BtbN> It also won't handle a whole lot of total FPS
[00:53:21] <BtbN> Should test that before expexting it to handle however many streams you expect
[00:54:30] <edman007> yea, will do, I think the end goal is decode and skip the encoding, but I want to test encoding...
[00:55:02] <edman007> maybe I test with H264 SW decoding and see if I have the same issues
[00:57:53] <BtbN> decoding does not impact quality, as long as it's fast enough

[01:14:00] <malmalmal> Hi there. I got a couple 4800 x 24b 1 channel wav files. I want to concatenate them, but I am wondering if doing so means re-encoding them and, so, changing the data in any way other than concatenating it ?
[01:14:53] <furq> maybe and no respectively
[01:15:06] <BtbN> it's wav, they're not encoded to begin with (most of the time)
[01:15:43] <malmalmal> Thanks furq, true BtbN , furq, could you please ellaborate ? I don't understand how can it be maybe and no
[01:16:17] <furq> maybe depending on how you concat them and also depending on your definition of reencode
[01:16:30] <furq> the concat filter will in ffmpeg terms decode to pcm, concat the files and then reencode to pcm
[01:16:34] <BtbN> There's a few select "special cases" where encoded stuff is in wav.
[01:16:40] <BtbN> But it's like a one in a million to encoder one of those
[01:16:44] <furq> but obviously that doesn't make any changes
[01:16:46] <BtbN> *encounter
[01:17:07] <furq> the concat demuxer won't decode them so it won't reencode in any sense
[01:18:26] <furq> bear in mind you'll need to specify -c copy with the demuxer or -c:a pcm_s24le with the filter or else it'll resample to 16-bit by default
[01:18:35] <furq> the pcm codecs are weird about that
[01:18:57] <malmalmal> I see, thank you both. The audio files are songs that will go into a machine learning type of program. The program itself is designed for studio quality voice recordings, and I wouldn't like to reduce the quality of my files or introduce any artifacts. Thus my question.
[01:19:36] <BtbN> It's wav
[01:19:55] <furq> https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html#concat-1
[01:20:03] <furq> -i concatlist -c copy out.wav
[01:20:09] <furq> will do what you want
[01:20:13] <malmalmal> Appreciated
[01:20:36] <malmalmal> ...reading the manual
[01:21:05] <furq> you can pretty much just skip to the example concat file at the bottom of that section

[01:22:49] <malmalmal> If I don't care about the order can I use wildcards ?
[01:23:16] <malmalmal> perhaps a loop ?Â¿
[01:23:50] <furq> not directly but you can do something like printf "file %q\n" * | ffmpeg -f concat -protocol_whitelist file,pipe -safe 0 -i - ...

[04:25:20] <splitongop> I'm using avfilter_graph_parse2 to parse my filter graph and then avfilter_graph_get_filter to get the filter. In order to do that I have to keep track of how of how many filters there are so I can get the right number. There has to be a better way to find the input and output filters? Like loop through all the filters and find the ones named Parse_buffer_x

[04:31:16] <splitongop> It says "a linked list of all free (unlinked) inputs/outputs of the parsed graph will be returned here". But I think mine are all linked. So I guess I need to unlink them somehow? or maybe build the buffer and buffersink manually? I got the buffer and buffersink as part of the filter description
[04:31:46] <splitongop> I just get back a null pointer so I'm assuming that means they are linked
[04:34:44] *** Joins: vlm (~vlm@user/vlm)
[04:35:55] <BtbN> That's literally the definition of an input/output pad
[04:35:58] <BtbN> that it's not linked
[04:36:46] <BtbN> Unless you somehow managed to build a closed circle, you will always end up with unlinked pads
[04:45:03] <splitongop> Yeah I have a closed circle. I guess I need to leave the buffer and buffersink unconnected. I basically have something likebuffer=video_size=1920x1080:pix_fmt=yuv420p:time_base=1001/60000:pixel_aspect=1/1:frame_rate=30000/1001,yadif=1,setsar=1,scale=1280:720,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=60000/1001,buffersink but I want to it automatically link it if possible
[04:48:38] <BtbN> Why not create the chain without your buffer source and sink filters, and then create those separately and attach?
[04:48:46] <BtbN> Then you don't need to find anything
[04:50:08] <splitongop> Alright, I'll give that a try. In theory that should be just what I need.
[04:51:22] <BtbN> The filtering example does literally exactly that as well

[15:51:44] <bartzy> Is there a reason to prefer zscale over scale for resizing a video?
[15:53:42] <sfan5> supposedly it's generally faster
[15:53:55] <bartzy> for resizing as well, not only color operations?
[15:54:47] <sfan5> https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg#performance says yes
[15:54:58] <sfan5> you could always benchmark it in your usecase
[15:56:24] <JEEB> I've found swscale be faster in some cases, but in general I find zscale more understandable as it splits the three H.273 elements
[15:56:48] <JEEB> while swscale seems to just have one enum value for one matrix for color space
[15:57:00] <JEEB> I have not been able to figure out what that includes
[15:57:09] <JEEB> I would guesstimate it's primaries and matrix mashed together
[15:57:26] <bartzy> and with regards to resizing ops only?
[15:58:28] <JEEB> both do non-linear space resizing, and in theory it's harder to mess up?
[15:58:41] <JEEB> of course zimg has more options for scaling
[15:58:59] <bartzy> basically I'd like to resize (down) in the highest quality possible, I don't really care about processing time.

[15:59:48] <bartzy> Right now I'm using lanczos without explicitly setting sws_dither (so it's auto, I don't really know what it chooses and how it affects quality)
[15:59:56] *** Joins: LuKaRo (~LuKaRo@p5deda401.dip0.t-ipconnect.de)
[16:13:32] <bartzy> also, I sometimes use `scale=in_range=full:out_range=full` just to tag the output as fullÂ which I understand is just a noop and frames don't really change. can I do the same with zscale or will ffmpeg remove that filter?
[16:17:18] <JEEB> if you just want to tag there's a filter to just set parameters in the AVFrame
[16:17:58] <JEEB> I mean, I expect ranges and widths|heithts and such to match and it will not create an swscale context
[16:18:08] <JEEB> so that way it just passes the input AVFrame through
[16:18:15] <durandal_1707> try it
[16:19:00] <JEEB> and in case of passthrough it doesn't tag the frame as far as I can tell?
[16:19:12] <JEEB> just !scale->sws => *frame_out = in;
[16:19:48] <JEEB> see the setparams filter if you want to set AVFrame properties
[16:20:23] <JEEB> anyways, off to take a walk

[16:31:30] <bartzy> thanks. I'm trying to use zscale with a PNG sequence and understand that I need to convert to gbrp first. I'm doing `-vf format=gbrp16,zscale=...,format=yuv420p10le` but zscale still barks that there is no path between colorspaces
[16:33:41] <durandal_1707> bartzy: you need to set proper parameters for zscale
[16:34:07] <durandal_1707> zscale filter is very picky about parameters, and does not accept nonsense/unknown paths
[16:34:32] <durandal_1707> this is not zscale limitation/feature but underlying feature of zimg library
[16:34:47] <bartzy> durandal_1707: I believe I did: `ffmpeg -framerate 30 -i sequence/0001_%05d.png -vf format=gbrp16,zscale=w=750:h=1334:filter=lanczos:matrixin=gbr:primariesin=bt709:transfer=iec61966-2-1:matrix=bt709:primaries=bt709:transfer=iec61966-2-1,format=yuv420p10le -f null -frames:v 1 -`

Even ffmpeg -h encoder=h264_nvenc doesnât list these presets.
[21:16:30] <stencl> I found some image on dockerhub (https://hub.docker.com/layers/willprice/nvidia-ffmpeg/latest/images/sha256-a4ea1b409aa80f096a79f4956d7a952ee7843849ef9a3ee8ef45a90fd2cb730c?context=explore) with nvidia support and this ffmpeg build prints this nvidia presets.â¨â¨Please, what am I doing wrong with my (jrottenberg) image?
[21:17:32] <BtbN> That link is a 404

But there is also the second reason, I need my custom Dockerfile because of other dependencies, so I use Dockerfile from jrottenberg as a base. But new presets are missing, don't know why
[21:24:08] <BtbN> At least mine and gyans builds have nvenc support. Again, if you mean that by "nvidia support".
[21:24:46] <BtbN> Also not sure what you mean by "new presets". Please be more precise with your questions.
[21:25:01] <stencl> Can you provide Makefile, Dockerfile or something like this?
[21:25:48] <stencl> nvenc supports presets p1-p7. by default, h264 has only default, slow, medium, hq, hp and so on
[21:26:35] <BtbN> You used outdated ffnvcodec headers for your build then.
[21:27:07] <BtbN> And/Or an outdated version of ffmpeg.
[21:27:42] <BtbN> That link there suggests ffmpeg 4.3, which is too old to know about the p1-p7 presets of latest nvenc versions.
[21:28:20] <durandal_1707> bartzy: ffplay output-p3-with-470bg.mov -vf "setsar=1,loop=-1:1:0[a];movie=output-p3-with-470bg.mov,setsar=1,loop=-1:1:0[b];movie=input.mp4,setsar=1,loop=-1:1:0[c];[a][b][c]interleave=3,oscilloscope=s=1:tw=1:y=0.7:g=0"
[21:28:32] <stencl> version of ffmpeg is 4.3.3   I'm using https://github.com/FFmpeg/nv-codec-headers of version 11.1.5.0
[21:28:54] <BtbN> Yeah, outdated version of ffmpeg then.
[21:29:15] <durandal_1707> bartzy: err, this one: ffplay output-p3-without-470bg.mov -vf "setsar=1,loop=-1:1:0[a];movie=output-p3-with-470bg.mov,setsar=1,loop=-1:1:0[b];movie=input.mp4,setsar=1,loop=-1:1:0[c];[a][b][c]interleave=3,oscilloscope=s=1:tw=1:y=0.7:g=0"
[21:29:21] <bartzy> durandal_1707: what does the output mean?
[21:29:33] <durandal_1707> guess which one does not match input
[21:29:49] <stencl> Oh, I'm going to try it (ffmpeg on master). Thanks a lot for help!

[21:34:29] <bartzy> OK. thank you. I did provide a minimal and perfectly valid example and a valid question.
[21:34:32] <durandal_1707> P3 is wider than bt709, you want to do something akin to SDR->HDR
[21:35:07] <durandal_1707> bartzy: i showed you minimal way that proves it that withbt709 looks different from input
[21:35:21] <bartzy>  with bt709?
[21:35:29] <durandal_1707> 409 whatever
[21:35:29] <bartzy> or with-470bg
[21:35:31] <durandal_1707> irrelevant
[21:35:33] *** Joins: ___nick___ (~quassel@cpc68286-cdif17-2-0-cust533.5-1.cable.virginm.net)
[21:35:38] <bartzy> OK, nevermind, thank you
[21:35:57] <durandal_1707> looks like you do not graps basic concepts
[21:36:12] <bartzy> that is probably true, I agree
[21:36:55] <durandal_1707> you want to get full color from something that was captured in limited color...
[21:37:23] <bartzy> and yet with the 470bg version, I get exactly the colors I thought I will, same as input. but in P3
[21:37:35] <durandal_1707> off course 75% red in P3 is different from 75% red in bt709
[21:37:44] <bartzy> I want it to be different
[21:38:26] <durandal_1707> doing it with bt470bg is not scientific or correct thing to do
[21:38:29] <bartzy> but my example is in input 100% red bt709, is not 100% red in P3 in without-470bg. and it is 100% red in P3 in with-470bg. That's exactly my question, why.
[21:39:04] <durandal_1707> bartzy: what about 75% blue/yellow/green ?
[21:39:16] <durandal_1707> are they also 75% in P3?
[21:39:35] <bartzy> Yes. If you just tag BT709 as P3. Then yes
[21:39:39] <bartzy> The pixel values should not change
[21:39:50] <durandal_1707> visually?
[21:39:53] <bartzy> in the with-470bg they did not change. and in without-470bg they did change.
[21:39:58] <bartzy> Visually they're not the same, obviously
[21:40:17] <durandal_1707> so only red is 75% red in P3
[21:40:25] <bartzy> what?
[21:40:39] <durandal_1707> in your converted file
[21:41:00] <bartzy> Take a color in the BT709 input: (255, 0, 0). It's the bottom right red rectangle. Do you agree with that statement?
[21:41:18] <durandal_1707> you are messed up
[21:41:26] <durandal_1707> that is RGB, file is in yuv
[21:41:35] <bartzy> omg
[21:42:04] <bartzy> displayed on an sRGB monitor with a player that does the conversion correctly. It's (255,0,0). Now do you agree with the statement?
[21:42:06] <bartzy> lol
[21:42:31] <durandal_1707> huh, you sure?
[21:42:45] <bartzy> really nevermind
[21:42:47] <durandal_1707> do conversion back to RGB, than you will see
[21:43:19] <durandal_1707> bt470bg is subset of P3
[21:43:50] *** Quits: stencl (~stencl@185.235.51.6) (Quit: Connection closed)
[21:43:58] <bartzy> so you're saying the bt470bg is clipped and the without-bt470bg is not clipped?
[21:44:11] <bartzy> because bt709 (which is without-bt470bg really) is also a subset of P3.

[22:24:08] <bartzy> I think I maybe understand why. bt470bg is 601 YCbCr to RGB conversion matrix. And there's a standard for sRGB in YCbCr: sYCC - BT601 matrix, BT709 primaries, sRGB transfer curve

[23:50:54] <bartzy> Yep, that's the case. durandal_1707 - so in my case, using 470bg is the correct thing to do. I was looking for the srgb equivalent in YUV and found it by accident

[23:56:17] <shibboleth> why is it that checkout releases/4.4 includes recent sec patches but tags/t4.4 doesn't?
[23:57:13] <BtbN> Why would it? It's a tag of the 4.4 release.
[23:57:40] <shibboleth> my mistake then, i'd assume it to be 4.4-branch trunk
[23:58:32] <another|> tags usually don't change
