[00:40:27] <sudomann> With docker compose how can I expose something running on the host to the container?
[00:41:33] <zoredache> sudomann: what kind of thing? If a filesystem make a bind mount volume. You shouldn't have to do anything for the network.
[00:42:00] <artok> just connect to hostip:port if it's listening connections there
[00:42:48] <sudomann> I'd like to expose a port
[00:42:50] <artok> if it listens only on localhost, then no, you can't connect, as 127.0.0.1 inside container is the container itself
[00:43:14] <sudomann> i have a service running in a GKE clusters and I wasnt to `kubectl proxy` to it on the host, making the port available to the container
[00:43:31] <artok> exposing port is just making port forwarding so hostip:port goes to container:someport

[03:05:44] <akik> devslash: i just watched a video of using an expressvpn setup and then connecting other containers to it
[03:06:01] <akik> expressvpn was also in a container
[03:07:54] <akik> https://github.com/Misioslav/expressvpn
[03:12:52] <raub> Why when I get the kernel headers inside a container, the headers version does not match that in the docker host? https://paste.centos.org/view/2546aebb
[03:13:19] <raub> It was even worse with alpine
[03:14:43] <artok> raub: what is your usecase ?
[03:15:05] <akik> raub: uname -a shows the host kernel 
[03:15:35] <artok> you can usually ask for different header versions if in the end your container is doing some module building and so on...
[03:17:14] <raub> artok, akik: I just told it to download (since debian) linux-headers-amd64. Am I wrong to assume by default it will get headers matching the host kernel's?
[03:18:27] <akik> raub: i think it gets the package that's for that version of debian and then there's a mixup
[03:18:28] <raub> I thought the container was run against the host kernel
[03:18:45] <akik> raub: yes the containers use the host kernel
[03:19:59] <raub> Incidentally, when i did the same in the alpine image, I got headers for kernel 5.X, not 4.X.

[03:25:29] <akik> i have to say i don't know either pfring or zeek

[18:15:49] <dustfinger> I installed DockerToolbox-19.03.1 in a windows 10 virtual box hosted by gentoo linux. The VM's network adapter is attached to NAT. When I run Docker Quickstart Terminal it fails with - Wrapper Docker Machine process exiting due to closed plugin server. See https://termbin.com/9q28.
[18:16:22] <dustfinger> Subsequent attempts to run the Docker Quickstart Terminal result in an error that terminates the VM.
[18:18:10] <dustfinger> I think this comes down to a networking issue. The error seems to suggest that the host (gentoo) is not letting the Guest read 127.0.0.1:50750.
[18:18:58] <BtbN> Are you trying to run Docker for Windows in a VM?
[18:19:11] <BtbN> Cause Docker for Windows installs a Linux VM. So probably won't work inside a VM itself.
[18:20:22] <dustfinger> Yah, I am trying to run docker in a windows VM. 
[18:20:34] <BtbN> Yeah, that won't work.
[18:20:48] <dustfinger> Okay, maybe I will have to think of a different solution then. Thank you for letting me know that this will simply not work.
[18:21:06] <BtbN> Why not run Docker on the Host, which already is Linux?
[18:23:51] <dustfinger> I have a windows service that I need to run and it needs to talk to 2 other services that run on linux. I don't have a windows box, so I tried to use a VM and thought that I would just run the other services in docker. What I will do now instead is run the windows service in a VM and then try to bridge the VMs network with the host so that the windows service can talk to the other two linux services running on the host.

[19:00:52] <programmerq> Daulity▸ each RUN line is its own isolated thing. if you want to change the working directory for one run command RUN cd /some/dir && wget abc.123/foo.txt
[19:00:52] <ada_> rapid16: modify the dockerfile
[19:01:05] <rapid16> Ohhh. I can tell it to install vim that way?
[19:01:07] <programmerq> Daulity▸ if you want to change the working directory for all subsequent commands, use WORKDIR
[19:01:07] <ada_> rapid16: or create a new dockerfile that inherits from one you're using now, and add your changes to that dockerfile, and build it
[19:01:11] <ada_> rapid16: sure
[19:01:13] <Daulity> programmerq: exactly what i figured :) 
[19:01:29] <Daulity> like i said every RUN command is a new instance .. 
[19:01:43] <Daulity> i figured it out after it went wrong and asked here :D

[19:22:15] <polymorphic> Is anyone here familiar with running docker containers off of GCE? Having an issue with the best way to file mount something via a GCP Storage Bucket directly at the host. The more expensive way is that I pay for a 10GB disk, but, that is very inefficient. I am trying to run something that is a variation on this
[19:22:16] <polymorphic> (https://gitlab.com/obviate.io/docker-okta-radius) and not sure how to either load the Storage Bucket via a startup script, or via some other means.
[19:22:28] <polymorphic> I have been trying to searching a relevant Google Ops/Cloud channel for the past day, but have not had much luck.
[19:23:22] <polymorphic> Long term, it seems like the best idea would be to build out a service account and credential files and pass that to the docker container and just run gsutil directly from within the docker container, but, that would take some more time to develop and for now, I just want to get something up and running and then work on improving it within GCP.

[20:39:34] <benjwadams> The config was running for *years*, however, even with the altered directory
[20:40:02] <ada_> so you shut down docker, copied /var/lib/docker to /home/docker, made this change in the daemon config, then started it up?
[20:40:13] <benjwadams> years ago, yes
