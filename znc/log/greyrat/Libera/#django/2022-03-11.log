[03:09:17] <FunkyBob> zamba: _which_ migration is complaining about that?
[03:09:25] <FunkyBob> is it, perhaps, from a 3rd party app?
[03:09:29] <zamba> but in my models.py i changed to: from custom_user.models import User
[03:09:35] <zamba> and then it ran correctly

[10:40:29] <yanchai> hi guys
[10:40:58] <yanchai> how do we create a form if we want to save a record based on the user logged in?
[10:41:19] <yanchai> like the model only contains foreinkey field user
[10:41:54] <yanchai> since there is no need to input or anything just generate a record based on the logged in user
[10:42:03] <soxfoxrox> How can I modify an annotation subtracting datetimes like "Article.objects.annotate(score=Now() - F('created_at'))" to return the number of days between the two datetimes instead of the complete duration between?

[13:09:37] <moldy> soxfoxrox: what does it give you instead?
[13:09:59] <soxfoxrox> moldy, it gives me a number between 0 and 23.
[13:10:20] <soxfoxrox> moldy, where oldest dates seems to give me the highest number.

[13:11:46] <soxfoxrox> moldy, (but I am unsure about the logic for when it returns what number)
[13:14:34] <moldy> did you try just `Now() - F('created_at')`?
[13:15:02] *** Quits: shangxiao (~davids@101.165.217.11) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[13:15:20] <moldy> or this maybe: https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/queryset-calculate-date-delta-with-today/7644/2
[13:16:10] <soxfoxrox> moldy, Now() - F('created_at') returns the full timedelta, e.g. 668 days, 22:17:51.633761 for something from May 10, 2020.
[13:16:41] <soxfoxrox> ExtractHour probably only returns the hour part of the timedelta, which I guess makes sense.
[13:17:06] <soxfoxrox> Because ExtractDay also in a sense only returns the day part of the timedelta.
[13:17:52] <soxfoxrox> moldy, I guess a solution could just be two time the number of days by 24 and then add the number of hours.
[13:18:00] <soxfoxrox> first two=to

[13:21:57] <moldy> soxfoxrox: out of curiosity: does ExtractMinute / ExtractSecond work as expected?
[13:22:27] <moldy> you could also use the timedelta and calculate the hours in python, i guess
[13:25:04] <soxfoxrox> moldy, yeah, they just give that part of the delta. So probably there's not a database function similar to adding .days to a Python timedelta.
[13:27:07] <moldy> soxfoxrox: googling a bit, it looks like it's possible to do this on the SQL level, at least not on postgres...
[13:27:32] <moldy> looks you have to do the math yourself
[13:28:04] <moldy> https://stackoverflow.com/a/1964602
[13:28:05] <soxfoxrox> moldy, luckily the math is simple :) Was just confused because I misunderstood the behaviour of ExtractDay.
[13:28:26] <moldy> unfortuntaely django doesn't have ExtractEpoch

Why Isn't the one-to-many just implemented as a not unique foreign key? also, if i want to associate two tables with either one of those two relations, what table should have the many-to-many atribute?

[16:02:06] <dkr13> For the M2M-Fields it doesn't really matter into which model you put the attribute. Django recommends to add it to the model that is used in the form (if it is applicable for your case)

[16:06:49] <moldy> if you apply your migrations and look at the db schema, everything should look familiar
[16:07:32] <moldy> for ManyToMany, it might become more familiar if you use an explicit through model. if you don't, django will just generate one for you.

[16:11:18] <moldy> (the same as non-prefetched values)
[16:11:30] <yanchai> transactions = Transaction.objects.filter(user=request.user).prefetch_related('order').prefetch_related('invoice')
[16:12:03] <yanchai> so if i will access the field in invoice {{ transaction.invoice.price }}?
[16:12:15] <yanchai> where price is a field in invoice model
[16:13:05] <moldy> yanchai: does a transaction have more than one order? does an order have more than one invoice?
[16:13:11] <yanchai> yes
[16:13:26] <yanchai> an invoice can have many order
[16:13:30] <moldy> yanchai: so you probably want to loop then?
[16:13:36] <yanchai> yes
[16:14:21] <moldy> {% for order in transaction.orders %} {{ order.something }} {% endfor %}
[16:14:35] <moldy> that should give you the prefetched field `something` from the order

[16:14:46] <yanchai> thanks mate
[16:15:15] <yanchai> wait
[16:15:45] <yanchai> how about if i am to display fields in transaction with fields in order and invoice?
[16:16:05] <yanchai> like a join query
[16:16:11] <yanchai> but using prefetch_fields
[16:16:43] <moldy> isn't that what i just showed you (for the first level at least)?
[16:16:58] <yanchai> oh ok thanks mate
[16:17:35] <moldy> you do the two-level prefetch and then you can have nested for loops to display the data without causing additional db queries

[16:23:22] <wakibi> Hello. Best way to test a form with a manytomany field using unittest?
[16:24:06] <moldy> wakibi: what exactly is giving you trouble here?
[16:24:13] <yanchai> moldy: check this out https://dpaste.org/f9QH
[16:24:44] <moldy> yanchai: does it work?
[16:24:55] <yanchai> nope
[16:25:02] <moldy> yanchai: what happens?
[16:25:11] <yanchai> i was thinking of a reverse query?
[16:25:24] <yanchai> since transaction model is the parent it shows empte
[16:25:26] <yanchai> since transaction model is the parent it shows empty
[16:25:45] <moldy> don't jump to conclusions
[16:26:02] <moldy> {% for invoice in transactions.invoice %} `.invoice` might be the wrong attribute name, can you show us your models?
[16:26:19] <yanchai> ok
[16:26:24] <evilpyro> thankyou moldy
[16:28:25] <yanchai> moldy: here is my model https://dpaste.org/VJmQ
[16:29:06] <moldy> yanchai: line 20 means each Transaction can have at most one Invoice
[16:29:26] <moldy> in that case you can use select_related(), and you don't need to loop since there will be 0 or 1
[16:29:26] <yanchai> yes
[16:29:44] <yanchai> oh ok
[16:29:52] <moldy> so e.g. {{ transaction.invoice.total_price }} should give you the price
[16:29:54] <yanchai> got it thanks
[16:31:03] <moldy> you will need to loop for Order though
[16:31:41] <moldy> BTW, i recommend to do related_name='orders' (plural) to make it less confusing
[16:31:51] <moldy> (or leave related_name alone and use the default order_set)
[16:32:08] <yanchai> moldy: ok thanks for the tip
[16:32:26] <yanchai> moldy: i really appreciate it :)
[16:35:37] <yanchai> moldy: we use plural related_name if it is a one-many relationship right?
[16:35:53] <yanchai> but if it is a one to one we user singular?
[16:35:58] <moldy> yanchai: yup

[17:45:58] <wakibi> 1. It was working okay before the services field was introduced. Just to emphasize that, it worked okay it I changed the services field to for example a boolean field. It only fails because services is a M2M field

[18:44:21] <dkr13> What is the best way to prevent creating multiple objects of a model? I want to have a settings model for application wide options that are configurable via the admin page. Currently I override the clean method in my Model.

[18:45:30] <aljosa> moldy any other ideas? I've confirmed that the AnnotatedModel._base_manager is "objects"

[18:46:07] <moldy> aljosa: "Base managers aren’t used when querying on related models" could be your problem, i guess?
[18:47:12] <aljosa> sure, that seems to be the problem. It only happens when select_related() is used. any suggestions how to resolve this?
