[00:26:35] <mario-goulart> I tried, but there's no clinfo. :-)  Let me check what provides that command.
[00:26:46] <klm> ah! yes. I can reproduce when there are no opencl platforms. is there a "pocl" in your package manager?
[00:27:13] <klm> I can fix the egg to produce a better error message

[00:28:50] <mario-goulart> Ok, there's a clinfo package that doesn't list anything.  I'm installing pocl-opencl-icd now.
[00:29:19] <mario-goulart> After that clinfo lists something.  I'm gonna retry the tests.
[00:29:27] <klm> thank you very much for looking into this :-) these things are such a hassle.
[00:29:48] <mario-goulart> No worries!  Thank you for the egg.
[00:30:35] <klm> hmm ... if there are no platforms to run the test-suite on, should the test fail?
[00:30:58] <klm> I think that would be the right approach. Otherwise, I guess things can get confusing.
[00:31:21] <mario-goulart> I agree.
[00:32:31] <klm> should I tag and add a new version in .release-info? or force-push the existing one?
[00:32:42] <mario-goulart> Now some tests succeed, but there's a failure out of test groups.  This might be a real issue: Error: bad argument type - not a structure of the required type u64vector #u32(4 4)

[00:36:56] <klm> ok, I think I'll force-push this one :-)
[00:37:04] <mario-goulart> ok
[00:37:31] <mario-goulart> I don't recall seeing line numbers in the output of the test egg.
[00:37:43] <klm> ok

[10:58:40] <Guest-liao> Okay
[10:59:22] <Guest-liao> Let me try it out.
[11:10:03] <Guest-liao> It works as copy the chicken-config.h file to the source folder
[11:10:12] <sjamaan> yeah
[11:10:30] <Guest-liao> Thanks.
[11:13:16] <Guest-liao> But there is just one line code (display "hello"). run ./hello 
[11:13:26] <Guest-liao> Error: unbound variable: display
[11:14:30] <Guest-liao> Kind of like it is not for scheme code. just for this c runtime code in Chicken.

[11:17:22] <vandusen> [eggs repo (r40806, by sjamaan)] Add -DHAVE_CHICKEN_CONFIG_H to compilation instructions for smallest possible self contained executable (otherwise runtime.c will crap out with lots of errors)

[11:18:57] <Guest-liao> Error: unbound variable: print
[11:19:47] <sjamaan> How did you compile hello.c from hello.scm?
[11:20:34] <Guest-liao>  chicken hello.scm -explicit-use -uses library
[11:21:48] <sjamaan> hm, maybe you need to put (import (chicken base)) at the top, because -explicit-use tells the compiler to not have the default imports in there
[11:22:34] <sjamaan> Or (import scheme) if you want to use display
[11:22:44] <Guest-liao> Okay. Let me try
[11:23:00] <Guest-liao> There is not a "buildtag.h" file
[11:23:18] <Guest-liao> Does it matter?
[11:23:29] <sjamaan> No, that's fine. These instructions haven't been updated for CHICKEN 5, it seems
[11:25:22] <Guest-liao> Okay.
[11:25:34] <Guest-liao> It works. Thanks very much.
[11:26:23] <sjamaan> Excellent
[11:27:43] <vandusen> [eggs repo (r40807, by sjamaan)] Add (import scheme) expression which is required due to -explicit-use, and remove mention of buildtag.h which is obsolete
[11:32:17] <Guest-liao> Okay. I have to leave for like a hour. Then I will finish the next part in the document.
[11:38:45] <Guest-liao> Same to "gcc -c runtime.c -Os -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing"
[11:39:18] <Guest-liao> should be "gcc -c runtime.c -Os -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -DHAVE_CHICKEN_CONFIG_H"
[11:43:17] <vandusen> [eggs repo (r40808, by sjamaan)] Also add -DHAVE_CHICKEN_CONFIG_H to the first gcc call
[11:48:13] <vandusen> [eggs repo (r40809, by sjamaan)] Remove -uses library as that is inferred by the import statement at the top
[11:48:37] <sjamaan> You don't need "-uses library", with -explicit-use it'll only take the imported libraries into account

[16:18:27] <Guest-liao> But the execute file by compiling 'gcc hello.c runtime.c library.c build-version.c -Os -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -DHAVE_CHICKEN_CONFIG_H  -o hello -lm'
[16:18:45] <Guest-liao> Can not work.
[16:19:27] <Guest-liao> Oh
[16:19:52] <Guest-liao> It is about "chicken hello.scm -explicit-use"
[16:36:58] <Guest-liao> Sound like there are different, "./csc hello.scm" and "./chicken hello.scm -explicit-use "  'gcc hello.c runtime.c library.c build-version.c -Os -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -DHAVE_CHICKEN_CONFIG_H  -o hello -lm
[16:43:11] <Bunny351> try -explicit-use + -uses library
[16:43:43] <Bunny351> you want to avoid pulling in dependencies to any other library unit . "library" should normally be enough
[16:44:25] <Bunny351> I have created minimal scheme interpreters in a similar manner, but with CHICKEN 4
[16:45:29] <Bunny351> -explicit-use means do not depend on any default libs, -uses library means only use the core "library" unit
[16:46:00] <Bunny351> you correctly added runtime.c and build-version.c, so this should normally work
[16:48:28] <Guest-liao> So as I talked with sjamaan, what he said that -uses library is in chicken 4
[16:50:43] <Guest-liao> self-contained executable means without chicken complier. 
[16:50:56] <Guest-liao> It run everywhere.
[16:52:18] <Guest-liao> I am testing to put into a docker without Chicken env. 
[16:59:43] <Guest-liao> Yeah. Bunny351 what about 'csc'?
[17:06:27] <Guest-liao> No. '-uses library' can not work in Chicken  5.
[17:07:11] <Guest-liao> It have to be 'chicken hello.scm -explicit-use'
[17:08:03] <Guest-liao> (import scheme) for proc display in hello.scm file. 
[17:09:20] <Guest-liao> I am wondering why it works by run './csc hello.scm' ,where is without (import scheme)
[17:10:18] <Guest-liao> Does csc natually link to the libchicken?
[17:10:23] <Bunny351> sure it works with C5
[17:10:49] <Bunny351> yes, csc does the linking
[17:10:57] <Guest-liao> where is it?
[17:11:37] <Bunny351> if you run csc with -v, it shows the intermediate steps
[17:15:54] <Guest-liao> Yes.
[17:16:02] <Guest-liao> 'gcc' 'hello.o' -o 'hello' -L/root/.local/lib -Wl,-rpath=/root/.local/lib -lchicken -lm -ldl
[17:16:33] <Guest-liao> libchicken in root/.local/lib/
[17:21:27] <Guest-liao> is possible to not execute ”rm hello.c“?
[17:22:53] <Guest-liao> I want to see the different what csc compile out the hello.c file with chicken compiler out the hello.c file
[17:24:06] <Guest-liao> I mean that, if people want to see the different, how can they do?
[17:25:53] <Guest-liao> Oh. sorry. 
[17:26:30] <Guest-liao> just run 'gcc hello.c runtime.c library.c build-version.c -Os -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -DHAVE_CHICKEN_CONFIG_H  -o hello -lm'
[17:27:35] <Bunny351> csc -k keeps all intermediate files
[17:27:46] <Bunny351> csc -t only translates to .c

[18:13:49] <Guest-liao> It is a kind of different.
[18:16:55] <Guest-liao> The file generated by csc have 'C_eval_toplevel' 'C_library_toplevel', which are not in the file genrated by chicken
[18:17:18] <Guest-liao> The file generated by csc have 'C_eval_toplevel' 'C_library_toplevel', which are not in the file generated by chicken
[18:19:40] <Guest-liao> the file generated by running 'chicken hello.scm -explicit-use', most like about C_fast_retrieve_symbol_proc like display in our case.
[18:20:19] <Guest-liao> the file generated by running 'chicken hello.scm -explicit-use', most like about C_fast_retrieve_symbol_proc  look up symbol 'display' in our case.
[18:23:39] <vandusen> SPAM! SPAM! SPAM!
[18:29:43] <Guest-liao> the file generated by running 'csc -t hello.scm', mostly like multiple  C_fast_retrieve_symbol_proc, but finally it has C_toplevel, which has the code of "hello"
[18:30:48] <Guest-liao> vandusen calm down.
[18:43:58] <Guest-liao> Sound like anything in the libchicken, we do not need to have to import for csc to build execute files or so files
[18:44:18] <Guest-liao> let me try it
[18:53:23] <Guest-liao> I just tried 'foreign-lambda', which is in the module foreign
[18:53:31] <Guest-liao> Same thing
[18:53:56] <Guest-liao> without (import (chicken foreign))
[18:55:05] <Guest-liao> Sound like unreasonable.
[18:55:19] <Guest-liao> I have to get sleep. see you guys later.
