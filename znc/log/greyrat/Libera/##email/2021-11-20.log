[18:42:50] <rob0> are you that spammer dude we banned?  (Probably not, "redempt1on" is not a new account.)
[18:43:43] <rob0> But if you are, it wasn't a matter of behavior, just that we don't like to help spammers in any way, nor to promote spam.
[18:45:13] <rob0> Anyway, literally any email-related subject is on topic, with that one caveat.

[20:00:58] <redempt1on> No
[20:01:04] <redempt1on> I has asked months about email marketing
[20:01:14] <redempt1on> and people got upset... and talked out of turn... and in jest
[20:53:08] <rob0> oh.  That's perfectly acceptable.  Marketing does not have to be spam (and if you want it to be effective, it had better NOT be spam!)
[20:53:41] <rob0> A thick skin is a useful attribute for survival in IRC. :)

[23:24:48] <redempt1on> I had inquired about scraping methods, with manual mailing (sequences, with the goal of having the person on phone or VOIP by the 4th or 5th email)
[23:24:57] <redempt1on> soft sell with the goal of closing on phone/voice
[23:25:31] <redempt1on> I was wondering if you can recommend any cost effective suites or software, because I paid $20 USD outright for a scraper program.. it seems 'ok', but I would prefer to have a full mailing suite
[23:26:21] <redempt1on> Soft sell, because, people detest being sold to on the first few emails... and 99 % a prospect won't pay a retainer/deposit unless the person has proven their identity over phone, but not only that, persuaded them to buy the service
