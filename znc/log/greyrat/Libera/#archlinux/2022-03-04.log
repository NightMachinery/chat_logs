[02:54:20] <kode54> cool, I managed to completely fill up my root partition on a 128GB drive
[02:54:37] <jb1277976> kode54: with what?
[02:54:51] <kode54> by running a massive delete operation from a wine app that in turn was just moving all the files from my 10TB storage array to my home directory's trash folder
[02:55:03] <kode54> bonus points, after it ran out of space, it proceeded to just delete the rest
[02:55:28] <kavothe> Never use wine. Never.
[02:55:53] <kode54> well, it is a Windows app that defaults to "delete" meaning "stuff it in the recycle bin"
[02:56:50] <jb1277976> kode54: this should tell you that winows is evil
[02:56:56] <kavothe> If you've 10TB in storage, wouldn't you be better of dual booting?
[02:57:07] <kode54> the 10TB of storage is a ZFS array
[02:57:22] <kode54> it's also a headless machine

[09:09:52] <cornduck> running arch and i3 on a laptop. this thing crashes every couple of days and im trying to get a clue whats causing it
[09:10:07] <cornduck> every command in a terminal will be "command not found"
[09:10:32] <cornduck> window switching gets weird and i can't really do anything but hold the power button down and force restart
[09:12:11] <dagle> cornduck: Sounds like filesystem issue. 
[09:12:20] <AlexC> thats what I thought as well
[09:13:29] <dagle> I would look for in the logs, something like "remounting filesystem as ro" or "unmounting filesystem".
[09:14:17] <cornduck> im guessing dmesg will only show messages from the current boot
[09:14:29] <ponies> cornduck: journalctl -k -b -1 
[09:14:29] <cornduck> i want to see what happened before restarting
[09:14:54] <ponies> you can specifiy which boot logs to load ^ -1 is the boot before. 0 is the current boot 
[09:15:00] <dagle> This happens after a sleep and not randomly?
[09:15:16] <cornduck> whoa thats awesome
[09:15:31] <cornduck> thank you ponies dagle 
[09:15:31] <dagle> My guess is that drive never actually wakes up.
[09:16:31] <cornduck> the logs only have these "arch kernel: audit: type=1130 audit..." messages at the end

[09:16:46] <cornduck> dagle: im not sure that its going to sleep but ill look into that. makes sense
[09:16:55] <ponies> yeah because -k shows only the kernel messages
[09:17:54] <dagle> cornduck: So it can be crashing mid session and not when you start to using it after putting it to sleep?
[09:18:27] <dagle> If the first is true, I would back up that drive now before you lose everything.

[10:50:28] <pounce> no-can do. not all games work for me in native steam because of <insert problem here>
[10:50:35] <pounce> mpan: right, but many users do use flatpak
[10:50:38] <Edu4rdSHL> Well, not an arch problem
[10:50:42] <mpan> Then it’s not a problem with that package.

[10:51:53] <Edu4rdSHL> Also, using the repo's steam package but with his custom runtime libraries you shouldn't face issues
[10:51:54] <pounce> eh, this might just be something i should do in the AUR
[10:52:30] <mpan> But it’s not in scope of Arch Linux official packages to deal with specific, non-official setups the users themselves invent. 
[10:52:36] <Edu4rdSHL> ^
[10:53:12] <pounce> Edu4rdSHL: i've tried both native and steam libs and it hasnt worked, but oh well that's a me problem
[10:53:32] <pounce> this is actually a steam problem and it's being tracked by them, and hasn't been fixed in months
[10:53:50] <mpan> Perhaps it’s possible to setup things so it works together. I am sure it will be available in Arch package too, if it’s implemented. But that also seems like an upstream issue which Arch will simply follow.

[15:28:10] <thurstylark> they don't want to use apt. they want to trick something else that *does* want apt into thinking it has the tools to do its job when it really doesn't
[15:28:19] <hoobaman> i dont want to use ubuntu or debian for work
[15:28:51] <ponies> so this 'compliancy agent' is checking lsb_release
[15:28:59] <thurstylark> package names are going to be a much bigger problem than faking lsb_release
[15:29:08] <thurstylark> not to mention package contents
[15:29:39] <thrice> agree that it's a terrible idea.  But you can of ocurse rebuild the lsb-release package:  https://archlinux.org/packages/community/any/lsb-release/

[15:30:32] <thurstylark> this.
[15:30:35] <thurstylark> this is the difference
[15:30:38] <hoobaman> I know, but as long all commands from compliancy agent run, and send data, i am fine :D
[15:31:30] <thrice> also, who cares what OS one runs at work?  they are paying you to do a job
[15:32:03] <thurstylark> if your employer has IT pros with enough knowledge and skill to be able to employ a compliance program for BYOB linux machines, tricking the software is the least of your worries
[15:32:06] <thrice> just goign to cause a lot more issues for yourself, IMO
[15:32:08] <Ghosthree3> if this very stupid software depends on apt somehow maybe a docker image or something ?

[17:41:14] <rcf> If we're going to talk about actual data-eating filesystems I think f2fs would need to top the list in my experience.

[17:42:28] <colo> rcf, yeah? on what kind of storage, and what caused the data loss?
[17:43:06] <rcf> eMMC, of course, and it was varying the kernel version, sometimes entirely by accident. 
[17:44:24] <rcf> It's also mostly fine these days, but I am far more wary of it than btrfs. Given its Samsung roots I'm not too surprised, having had one of their phones....

Here is my cabal config http://ix.io/3RkC ... I even removed the comments and followed the indentation. This is

[22:07:16] <thurstylark> if pam can't read its config, it doesn't know what to do with login credentials, so rejects all

[23:36:37] <senj> Oh, pip3... I'll try.
[23:36:47] <MacGyver> *UN*install using pip3.
[23:37:07] <MacGyver> Because I imagine that installing using pip is how you got into this mess in the first place.
[23:37:26] <MacGyver> Rather than try to have pacman win this fight, make pip back down.

[23:39:58] <Khorne> MacGyver, say what?
[23:40:01] <Khorne> :')
[23:42:06] <MacGyver> senj: pip(3) is a python package manager. If you (or some script) ran pip as root, installing some python package, it installs it in the exact same location as where pacman would put the same python package. Next time you try to install something through pacman that depends on that, pacman tries in turn to install the package there but sees files already there not under its control, and rather
[23:42:08] <MacGyver> than take the risk of blowing up your system it just refuses to continue.
[23:42:11] <MacGyver> senj: That's all the reading you need.
[23:42:20] <senj> Khorne, MacGyver, thrice thank  you. I screwed up way back.
[23:42:24] <MacGyver> senj: Bottom line: Don't install python packages *system-wide* using sudo pip.
[23:42:47] <MacGyver> senj: If you need a python package system-wide, *always* do it through a pacman package, whether from official repositories, AUR, or something home-brewed.
[23:42:48] <senj> Understood. Thank you.
[23:43:11] <MacGyver> senj: The way out is uninstalling the package(s) using pip, then installing their pacman counterparts.
