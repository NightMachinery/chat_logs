[12:00:50] <jesk> is it correct that the log4j vulnerability is basically unaffective (including DNS leakage) for ElasticSearch >=7 and JDK >8 ?

[12:16:06] <beorn_> jesk: Not really. ES uses mainly log4j 2.11 which is vulnerable. The good part is that Elasticsearch only logs its own activity and is less affected by user input.
[12:16:12] <beorn_> jesk: Logstash, however.
