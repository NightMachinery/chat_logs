Bing also provides a satellite map option I read but I'm not that interested in it

[03:41:34] <banshi> alextee: what about unincorporated organizations?
[03:45:01] <alextee> banshi, my guess is that it doesn't apply. "An unincorporated association is not incorporated, so it cannot enter into contracts or own property in its own right."
[03:45:11] <alextee> I think under law copyright is a form of property
[03:47:39] <banshi> alextee: so, If I'm a member of unincorporated organization and I have modified GNU GPL app, then I should share source code with my modification to members?
[03:48:04] <banshi> in case when I share binary form
[03:48:21] <alextee> I don't know if "Copyright (C) My group of friends" counts as a legal entity, it would probably mean that copyright is owned by each member individually. if you made the changes for example they would be made in your personal capacity and you'd have to abide by the GPL and share your changes with other individuals such as people in your organization
[03:48:25] <alextee> that's just my interpretation
[03:49:00] <alextee> maybe others have more experience with this
[03:50:38] <banshi> ok. Another question. Say, I have modified GNU GPL web-app. I can grant access to it to my friends. Should I share source code too?
[03:51:10] <alextee> https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/trademark/346946/unincorporated-associations-can-own-and-enforce-trademark-rights
[03:51:11] <banshi> grant access to http://example.com:777 with login and password ^
