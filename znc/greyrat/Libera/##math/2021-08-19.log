[00:12:09] <cherim> There is an extensive theory that works in this direction, of course. In principle, one can borrow the result directly from it
[00:12:26] <cherim> You have to sum over partitions that correspond to Jordan block sizes
[00:12:51] <cherim> Obtain a formula for the size of the stabilizer for each partition, etc.
[00:12:58] <cherim> But it's a lot of work

[02:10:40] <Kaylah> hmm no, but if I would move in the direction of a pole standing perpendicular to the earth's surface, I would be floating in the sky, right
[02:11:22] <Fangs> sure, so that direction should be projected down again to the surface, more-less
[02:11:30] <Kaylah> ah I see
[02:11:58] <xormor> y = 2; when y = f(x) and x can be any real number proves that 2 lines in the same direction never cross each other in Euclidean geometry because otherwise y=g(x)=0 (x can be any real number) would have a crossing point with y=2 so that y0=y1=f(x)=g(x)
[02:12:20] <xormor> am I right?
[02:12:36] <xormor> did I invent something new?
[02:12:47] <Kaylah> so if the gradient vector has a direction in which x increases by 2, y increases by 1 and z increases by 4, then I just have to ignore that z increase and instead just move 2 in the x direction and 1 in the y direction

[02:33:27] <cherim> Your picture has a legend "U(x, y, z)=k" for the surface
[02:33:44] *** Quits: oj (~oj@user/oj) (Remote host closed the connection)
[02:33:51] <Kaylah> but then still I don't quite understand it, because if I start in point (p,q,r) and move along the gradient even a little bit, I move off the surface
[02:33:52] <cherim> You don't even need to know the gradient to know what happens if you move along the surface

[02:34:54] <Kaylah> if I'm on the mountain and move in the direction in the vector, I would expect it to be like a UFO pulling me up in a direction perpendicular the mountain's surface in the point where I was standing
[02:35:07] <Kaylah> so that's why I'm confused
[02:35:18] <cherim> This is all about totally different things
[02:35:43] <cherim> The mountain example is about a function of two variables, where the mountain is a graph z=f(x, y)
[02:36:06] <cherim> Your picture is about a function of 3 variables, like temperature in 3D
[02:36:15] <Kaylah> oooh really
[02:36:21] <Kaylah> oh wow yes
[02:36:27] <Kaylah> so z is another variable here
[02:36:40] <Kaylah> and k is just one possible value of the function
[02:37:19] <Kaylah> damn I think I get it now...
[02:37:58] <Kaylah> so in this same picture, you could draw another surface with a value U(x,y,z) = k+1
[02:38:15] <Kaylah> and this could for instance be floating a bit above the surface we see now
[02:38:40] <Kaylah> and if we're standing in point (p,q,r) and we want to get to that new surface with the shortest possible path, we would have to follow the gradient
[02:38:52] <Kaylah> is that correct?
[02:39:32] <cherim> Yes, if the difference in values (k+delta - k) is small enough
[02:39:40] <Kaylah> indeed
[02:39:56] <Kaylah> wow thank you for helping me understand it, mr/mrs cherim!

[03:40:03] <OverCoder> since when we can make such wild edge cases like that
[03:40:03] <somiaj> One way I think about it is 0! means you have an empty product (similar to 2^0 -- you aren't multily anything together), and when you have an empty product it is useful to default to the multiplication identity 1.

[03:41:20] <OverCoder> hmm
[03:41:21] <tusko> qued
[03:41:43] <somiaj> Nothing initial wrong with pi = 3, but your definition of pi is not the standard ratio of a cicrumfrance to the diamater.
[03:42:27] <somiaj> OverCoder: Anyways, often times we extend definitions to what is the most useful, or allows us to extend things in a nice way.
[03:42:37] <OverCoder> hmmm
[03:43:00] <somiaj> so you cuold define factorial to be n! = n * (n-1)!, and 1! = 1, but you can easily extend this by starting with 0! = 1 instead
[03:43:26] <OverCoder> I see
[03:43:58] <somiaj> Also in various formulas like C(n,k) = n!/(k! * (n-k)!), it just makes it so we don't have to deal with k=0 as a special case
[03:44:16] <somiaj> since C(n,0) = n!/(0! * n!) = n!/n! = 1, and there is exactly 1 way to choose nothing from n objects.

[03:46:20] <somiaj> In that case it really depends on what you want 'pi' to be, but most prefer the define it as the ratio of the circumfrance of a circle to its diamater, and in that case it is irrational, but there are lots of different approximations.

[06:13:15] <qergle> are you referring to an operator? if not, please define adjoint.
[06:13:51] <pretty_dumm_guy> so in finite dimensional vector space over \mathbb{R}, adjoint would refer to the transpose of a matrix

[06:15:07] <johnkeats6> you can interpret 'adjoint' as 'dual map', and then the question makes sense since tr : M_n --> R is a linear operator
[06:15:10] <johnkeats6> but the answer is boring
[06:15:17] <johnkeats6> since R* is pretty boring
[06:15:44] <johnkeats6> the adjoint is the operator that, given c, returns you the functional on matrices that, given X, gives you c tr(X)

[21:49:05] <cherim> Compact = any open cover contains a finite subcover
[21:49:17] <cherim> This is "in terms of open / not open" as you wanted
[21:49:22] <Z-module> Gurkenglas: in fact, the bijectivity in all this isn't all that relevant. Any continuous image of a compact space is compact, and a homeomorphism is a much stronger condition than that.
[21:49:23] <cherim> It's what Z-module says
[21:50:12] <riv> you need like a language where you can only state things that are preserved by homeomorphisms
[21:50:54] <cherim> It's called topology
[21:51:08] <Z-module> essentially if the property you have is definable using nothing but open sets and standard set operations, then homeomorphisms preserve that property

[22:06:45] <qergle> right, the ways would: 6*9!/(2!*2!)-3!*7!/2!

[22:07:21] <kobalt> 3!*7!/2!
[22:07:36] <cherim> So what's the final answer?

[23:07:21] <droid3> i was thinking more about this question aka factoring polynomials over finite fields. It seems the best algorithms we got are in (n^1.5 +nlogq)logq where q is the number of element making up the finite field
[23:08:25] <droid3> I was wondering if there is any better more efficient algorithms for just testing if a polynomial over a finite field is irreducible ?
[23:09:34] <riv> the irreducibility tests I know of are always returning Irreducible or Unknown

[23:10:31] <droid3> i get the naive way is just to run thru testing all element in your finite field to see if any one of them is a zero/root of the polynomial
[23:11:25] <riv> yeah you dont want to do that...
[23:11:40] <droid3> But thats really really bad runtime for when the finite field order is huge forget it ...its like trial and error method for prime factorization runtime

[23:12:41] <droid3> Ask the question a little bit differently is there an efficient method for finding a root of a polynomial over a finite field or determine no such root exist?
[23:13:31] <droid3> Sure for small order fields no problem just to trail and error it. But that method gets bad really quick!
[23:13:42] <cherim> "Reducible" and "has a root" are very different things
[23:14:31] <droid3> sure that why i was asking both question if its easier to find a root then it is to reduce into irredicible polynomials
[23:14:47] <droid3> Might have worded it incorrectly sorry about that
[23:14:55] <riv> a polynomial may be reducible but not have any roots
[23:15:26] <Z-module> for example  x^4 + x^2 + 1   is reducible in F_2[x] but has no root in F_2

[23:18:03] <droid3> well i was just curious if the complexity are hard for one or the other.
[23:20:10] <cherim> 1.3 in https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01104251/document has an overview
[23:20:39] <cherim> In general, factoring and root finding are not radically different in hardness
[23:21:01] <cherim> Randomized algorithms for root finding have pretty good performance
[23:21:16] <cherim> Worst case is less attractive
[23:22:45] <droid3> Ok curious for most people or students that are undergraduate they usually work with Z[x] or Q[x] polynomial rings
[23:23:39] <droid3> And we all know from gauss and others that if you can factoring/finding roots over Z[x] is equivalent to doing it over Q[x] and visa-versa

[23:25:36] <cherim> Soon any sentence will be a wiki page address I guess
[23:25:39] <droid3> Is there any test better then the rational root test for finding roots because if the coefficients are large its like prime factorization or trail and error to exhaust all possibilities

[23:46:57] <riv> you could make it work in general
[23:48:10] <droid3> So it becomes approximating the coefficients for those polynomials to some given precision you want with bisection method / newtons ..etc

[23:49:43] <droid3> Ya an approximation is much more computationally feasible then finding exact. And exact in theory cannt be done on a computer anyway because there irrational and alot are so irrational that they cannt be expressed in radicals even worse.
[23:49:44] <riv> you can use a continued fraction approximation to get good rationals and then you know that the numerator and denomimator must be below a certain value
[23:49:53] <riv> this lets you avoid factorization
[23:49:59] <riv> which is used in rational root test
[23:50:33] <droid3> So at this point its better just to approximate over C[x] then build it back to R[x] by multiplying the complex conjugate roots

[23:51:31] <riv> im not sure how you find roots in C
[23:51:39] <riv> you can maybe uses discs and cauchys theorem

[23:51:48] <riv> or some kind of space partitioning
[23:52:30] <droid3> O your talking for Z[x] and Q[x] ya using continue fraction expansion to weed down the trial and error for the rational root test is clever and ya makes it in some case more computational feasible good idea riv
[23:53:50] <droid3> About what i said for C is since fundamental theorem of algebra says every polynomial factors into linear factors over C.
[23:54:55] <droid3> "IF" we had away to factor over C into linear factors efficently for a given polynomial then we also have its factors over R[x] by multiplying complex conjucates
[23:56:03] <droid3> because R[x] can have only linear or quadratic factors linear would be real number roots and quadratic would mean complex roots exist for polynomial
[23:56:12] <riv> tryue
[23:57:30] <droid3> Anyway finding exact roots of a polynomial on a computers is kind of impossible in general because of irrationals and also because of Galois theory.
[23:57:56] <droid3> So at some point you have to do like you said and just approximate roots
[23:58:57] <droid3> And then just approximate from there the factors over R[x].
