[05:49:07] <pacblinky> why would they do that

[05:49:17] <sheep> it's not centrally funded
[05:49:43] <rob`> in all seriousness the US NSA probably _should_ be funding projects that ensure citizen's data security, instead of being glorified domestic spooks :P
[05:49:54] <pacblinky> pnbeast people  outside call it the deepweb
[05:49:57] <pacblinky> thats why i am here

[07:12:40] <alschaapman> Nah, it's always 100% because I've never adjusted that level
[07:12:52] <alschaapman> It will only be something other than 100% if you change the slider *in OBS*
[07:13:21] <alschaapman> Changing the volume in PulseAudio doesn't create any change there, in advanced audio properties
[07:13:34] <alschaapman> ionface: I'm not sure what you mean by same as stream
[07:13:49] <ionface> since you have pipewire, any chance audio is routed through something there?
[07:14:10] <alschaapman> I think it's unlikely. I'm not using Pipewire as the sound server
[07:14:13] <alschaapman> Been meaning to try it out though
[07:14:15] <ionface> there are recording to disk options, like high quality big filesize, and same as stream etc
[07:15:45] <alschaapman> I'm using Arch with all the latest repo packages. Doubt that has any bearing, but I guess I never made any mention of distribution
[07:15:48] <ionface> so before when you had this problem, did you make any pulse audio changes like adding sinks or switching from monitor to hardware?
[07:16:06] <alschaapman> No, definitely no changes to Pulse configuration. It was something that I did in OBS Studio
[07:16:16] <alschaapman> And it was something REALLY simple
[07:17:00] <alschaapman> I know I've said this before, but I really could swear "Lock Volume" was the thing, and I'm starting to wonder if something about how OBS handles sound changed in a way that affected the working of that option

[10:44:33] <blahboybaz> it said private key (not public)

[10:48:59] <Gustavo6046> 1. The game causes the system to lockup precisely when I try to alt-tab from it, preventing all regular input.
[10:49:23] <mlu> how's the cooling on the s ystem?
[10:49:24] <Gustavo6046> 2. With sysrq magic keys enabled in sysctl configuration, those and ONLY those still work when said lockup happens.

[10:50:24] <Gustavo6046> Another thing I found is that, in htop, a lot of tasks will appear at the top with state D (which means uninterruptible threads, which basically means the task is waiting on I/O) if I sort by state.
[10:50:28] <Gustavo6046> But sometimes that sorts itself out even without taps.

[12:17:45] <Gustavo6046> and was about to crush my enemy from an army that had, at first was like 3 troops, but quickly raised to 60 with the power of multiple military buildings, powerful resources, socialism, and the Lakotan bonuses.
[12:17:54] <Gustavo6046> And especially the multiple military buldings thing.
[12:18:10] <prasaddash12> What Is the game by the way?
[12:18:23] <Gustavo6046> But I digress. I guess the game freezing was its way of telling me "it's 4:48 AM, go the heck to sleep".
