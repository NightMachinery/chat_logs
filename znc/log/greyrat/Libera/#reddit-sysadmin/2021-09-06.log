[01:31:18] <A-KO> in general, if you put the same effort into learning Windows as Linux--Windows these days will give you an undeniably as a whole more secure platform, depending on use case. However, even the vast majority of Windows environments aren't even scratching the surface of the security technology available in Windows 2016 and newer--and as such we're where we are today. Some of that is 
[01:31:18] <A-KO> Microsoft's fault, most of it's not.
[01:31:51] <sd> 06<A​da> the shitty logs are worth it for me to be able to configure everything through powershell in a format that makes sense
[01:31:52] <A-KO> Where Microsoft has absolutely failed is modern management technologies. They lost the 'spark' they had in the late 1990s and early 2000s for systems development.
[01:32:18] <A-KO> AD and its associated tooling was genius for the time, and still genius even today.
[01:33:05] <A-KO> As an example. What I find funny is so many infosec and security folks place tons of focus on AD security. Yet nearly all public internet dumps do not involve actually compromising an AD domain.
[01:33:39] <A-KO> Is it perfect? nah.
[01:33:45] <A-KO> Under the wrong hands it's pretty vulnerable
[01:34:23] <A-KO> but if you put the same effort in as many people seem to do with Linux, it's actually from a bottom of tech perspective a bit superior. But, the interfacing to so much of that is absolutely terrible. And the technology community has changed over the years.
[01:34:37] <A-KO> Things like COM didn't scale very well to modern development paradigms--and they have no answer for it
[01:34:42] <A-KO> DCOM/RPC the same problem.
[01:35:26] <A-KO> Most people have switched to using HTTP/REST/JSON and that's where like 99% of the development efforts go. DCOM is effectively archaic, but still widely required in a lot of core Windows technologies
[01:35:42] <A-KO> the mountain to climb to learn Windows is continuing to get higher
[01:37:08] *** Quits: Aoyagi (~yags@user/aoyagi) (Quit: qat)
[01:38:14] <sd> 08<c​ritamine> Hunter around?
[01:38:15] <A-KO> As an example, network authentication is still not truly solved in the linux community. It was only relatively really recently that anyone even bothered to try and solve it. Microsoft solved this problem in the early 2000s using Kerberos. Is Kerberos perfect? Nah. Has lots of issues, but those issues are largely related to specifics of implementation and surrounding technologies rather 
[01:38:15] <A-KO> than the core product itself. Anything else is just a problem inherent to SSO platforms.
[01:39:06] <A-KO> Kerberos' biggest problem is the fact that you can generally RDP into a remote machine and spread your TGT all over the network more or less indiscriminately, often times without knowledge of it happening; making it easier to steal with a wide attack surface.
[01:39:24] <A-KO> but that's a Windows problem, not a Kerberos problem ; and really a problem with the associated technologies (CredSSP, etc)
[01:39:39] <A-KO> These things can be fixed/improved upon.
[01:40:13] <A-KO> Kerberos predates Microsoft, of course ; but they were the ones that really made it a worldwide used authentication platform.
[01:40:50] <A-KO> OAuth2/OIDC have similar challenges with things like SSO. Security of the token provider is a similar challenge to securing a KDC (DC) in Windows.
[01:41:22] <A-KO> Stealing session cookies and OAuth tokens is minimally different to stealing Kerberos TGTs--and comes down to configured lifetime settings
[01:42:35] <signalblue> any opinions on .us.com domains?
[01:42:36] <sd> 09<H​aise> A-KO: I agree with majority of your points and I should probably look at more Windows LOL

[01:43:02] <A-KO> I'm relatively platform agnostic, and generally do a lot of yelling at Microsoft directly
[01:43:02] <sd> 09<H​aise> I went so far for AIX that I got POWER7 based server
[01:43:12] <A-KO> I've given my peace of mind directly to their VPs of their tech stacks
[01:43:18] <signalblue> A-KO: when done right, Linux authentication is rock solid
[01:43:18] <A-KO> I've been on calls with them
[01:43:24] <A-KO> signalblue: same with Windows really :P
[01:43:29] <signalblue> yeah
[01:43:39] <signalblue> now only if MS can fix their RRAS nonsense
[01:43:43] <signalblue> :)
[01:43:50] <A-KO> I still have to spend a lot of time telling people to use certificate auth for OAuth2 authentication rather than shared secret (i.e. passwords)
[01:43:58] <A-KO> and that scales platforms
[01:44:12] <A-KO> in that regard, Microsoft's libraries are actually quite nice. If you're integrating with Azure, anyway
[01:44:27] <signalblue> when using Azure is the key term
[01:44:31] <signalblue> but yeah

[01:45:05] <A-KO> sure--but what I mean is certificate auth is still significantly better than shared secret auth. The latter is significantly easier, of course. And lots more libraries support it.

[02:03:14] <A-KO> Azure has a decent answer atm....Temporary Access credentials, which should help remove passwords. But for a very brief moment, it's still a password
[02:03:17] <sd> 06<A​da> next time my networking mysteriously breaks inside wsl2 ill give podman a go
[02:03:51] <A-KO> signalblue: SCEP is simply using a password to request a certificate. Mostly used for issuing certs to mobile devices for MDM management/authentication/etc.
[02:03:57] <signalblue> but this is MDM stuff we are talking about
[02:04:10] <A-KO> SCEP isn't just a mobile device thing, it didn't start as that
[02:04:14] <signalblue> and there is no other way around this?
[02:04:17] <A-KO> it was first built for network devices (i.e. switches/routers)
[02:04:18] <A-KO> nope
[02:04:23] <signalblue> like what is the issue with it...
[02:04:29] <signalblue> there doesn't seem to be one
[02:04:40] <signalblue> ohhhh
[02:04:46] <signalblue> reliance on passwords?
[02:05:18] <A-KO> The thing about it is SCEP was built originally for switches, routers, and more or less already "pre-trusted" equipment. It was then commandeered for usage in mobile devices--which are now otherwise untrusted platforms, versus the previous "fortress trust" boundary of say, a closed network.
[02:05:31] <A-KO> SCEP was built for closed networks, but was expanded to be used for open networks--and then you can now see where the problem is

[02:05:51] <signalblue> that's the evolution of the Internet A-KO
[02:06:21] <signalblue> SMTP was designed for a very small, private network where senders did not need to be verified but then that protocol blew up with the Internet

[02:07:08] <A-KO> though I expect Acme to become the defacto solution, or some evolution of it
[02:07:15] <signalblue> yeah
[02:07:19] <sd> 09<H​aise> oh so there is no standard that MS/Red Hat/SUSE can implement ?
[02:07:20] <signalblue> SCEP is 10 years old
[02:07:42] <signalblue> although the RFC is from 2020
[02:07:58] <A-KO> SCEP is older than 10 years lol
[02:08:25] <A-KO> Ada: That's because vendors want to lock everyone into their solutions. Teams vs Slack vs Webex Teams vs Discord--nobody has made an "open" communications platform that just works.

[04:08:48] <corn266> see
[04:08:53] <TheJollyRoger> I'm pleased to say no blood was lost during that little adventure, but I've had a lot of practice with it.
[04:09:00] <corn266> even pirates are going nuts cause of the lack of ships
[04:09:06] <TheJollyRoger> Ehehehehe
[04:09:26] <corn266> i bet you didn't even shave your nuts
[04:09:34] <TheJollyRoger> No nut shaving here! 
[04:10:19] <corn266> i guess so cause you'd probably be in the hostpital otherwise
[04:10:28] <corn266> bleeding bald headed fuck
[04:13:19] <TheJollyRoger> Learning to use a straight razor is kind of fun though.
[04:14:01] <TheJollyRoger> Before I started using it though what I would do was to inflate a balloon, then cover the balloon with shaving cream and then use the razor to scrape all the shaving cream off the balloon without popping it.
[04:14:21] <corn266> why though
[04:14:35] <TheJollyRoger> Because it's better I make mistakes on the balloon than make mistakes on my neck.
[04:14:47] *** Quits: trekkie1701c (~trekkie17@user/trekkie1701c) (Quit: :P)
[04:15:22] <corn266> a balloon is like 100x more sensitive than your fucking neck
[04:15:40] <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. So I figured if I could get good there then I'd be set.
[04:16:16] <corn266> lmao
[04:16:28] <corn266> you'd be shaving off hairs of haires
[04:17:51] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> that's a pretty good practice method
[04:18:00] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> blade angle first, shaving second
[04:18:30] <corn266> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybezf8ppmBY
[04:18:43] <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. I've heard horror stories about guys getting really deep, ugly cuts because they started too quickly and I didn't want to make the same mistake.
[04:24:04] <Work-BWMerlin> Is it called a URL redirect when a I take mysite.domain/directory/pageIwant.html and make it show when people go to mysite.domain?
[04:24:59] <CoJaBo> wat
[04:25:55] <Work-BWMerlin> I have a site mysite.com
[04:26:13] <Work-BWMerlin> and I have a page on that site mysite.com/directory/page.html
[04:26:40] <Work-BWMerlin> What do I need to put in place so that when people go to mysite.com the go to page.html
[04:27:15] <Work-BWMerlin> Normally you have default.html or index.html in the main directory, but what if you have a sub directory?
[04:30:21] <xe0n> the steps required will depend on which web server is serving the pages (iis, apache, nginx, etc)
[04:30:25] <estranger> index.html with a meta refresh or a redirect rule in the httpd
[04:31:04] <Work-BWMerlin> IIS
[04:31:14] <estranger> burn it to the ground
[04:31:21] <Work-BWMerlin> The IIS default site comes up and I would like to change that
[04:31:25] <xe0n> yep
[04:31:51] <Work-BWMerlin> Not my choice, was a requirement for the point of sales application.
[04:31:55] <xe0n> its fine
[04:31:58] <Work-BWMerlin> Also RDP gateway
[04:32:01] <estranger> just keep clicking
[04:32:06] <estranger> will eventually work out
[04:32:37] <Work-BWMerlin> If I know the name of what it is I am trying to do I can google it up
[04:33:40] <xe0n> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/url-rewrite-module/creating-rewrite-rules-for-the-url-rewrite-module
[04:35:48] <Work-BWMerlin> Ah, so the term is URL rewrite, thanks
[04:36:44] <sd> 13<J​ay-Ros> yep, and if you're using IIS there's an addin for it
[04:41:38] <xe0n> rdp gateway, as in you want to have it redirect to /redweb or whatever the url is
[04:41:56] <xe0n> remote.company.com > remote.company.com/rdweb 
[04:43:12] <xe0n> https://www.heelpbook.net/2016/windows-server-rds-2012-redirect-rdweb-from-iis-default-root-site/
[04:43:21] <Work-BWMerlin> Yes, I do want to do that
[04:45:52] <xe0n> before you do any of that, make sure you have your communication to staff drafted, reviewed, and sent out before you make the change
[04:46:19] <xe0n> give them warning of the change...dont think you'll break too much stuff, but still...i would communicate these changes before you make them
[04:46:37] <corn266> "i could have been anyone from anywhere, but i those me from right here"
[04:47:09] <corn266> actually
[04:47:23] <corn266> that's kinda a good thought
[04:48:52] <Sousapro> Apple really hates getting money from me lol
[04:49:08] <Sousapro> Almost impulse bought a m1 Mac mini refurb
[04:49:32] <Sousapro> 4k hdr10 is a dumpster fire in there unless you buy their stupid monitor 
[04:49:36] <Sousapro> Dodged a bullet
[04:49:55] <Sousapro> Guess I'll keep searching for a decent low power living room PC lol 
[04:50:39] <Work-BWMerlin> xe0n no issue there, staff have been using it internally only as it broke because the previous person didn't renew the cert

[04:51:04] <xe0n> okay...how does that change the url?
[04:51:04] <xe0n> lol
[04:51:06] <Work-BWMerlin> I have just finished doing up the documentation on how they can access the .rdp file so all I need to do is change the URL in the documentation
[04:51:07] <rpifan> they have made AOE too mechnicanic
[04:51:12] <rpifan> there are build guides and orders now

[04:51:39] <xe0n> access the rdp file? huh, if you're using rdweb you could gpo to deploy and integrate it all nicely, can have stuff published to the start menu
[04:51:45] <xe0n> lol
[04:52:01] <Work-BWMerlin> lol xe0n, you should know better than that
[04:52:08] <xe0n> oh too much work for you?
[04:52:09] <xe0n> cool
[04:52:10] <xe0n> lol
[04:52:12] <Work-BWMerlin> Remember, we have two domains
[04:52:18] <rpifan> xe0n, is your mom still around btw
[04:52:46] <rpifan> This Serverless Function has timed out.
[04:52:46] <rpifan> Your connection is working correctly.
[04:52:46] <rpifan> Vercel is working correctly.
[04:52:47] <rpifan> wtf is that
[04:52:50] <xe0n> i would deploy the file so it's centrally managed
[04:53:01] <xe0n> regardless of two domains, gpo can still do that for a single file
[04:53:07] <Work-BWMerlin> I like the idea, may do that
[04:53:09] <xe0n> dont make em go find anything, but whatever
[04:53:23] <Work-BWMerlin> Let me re-write the URL, update the documentation and then I can see about pushing it out
[04:53:46] <Work-BWMerlin> I cannot push the file out to our Mac users
[04:53:58] <xe0n> they should be able to subscribe to the feed
[04:53:59] <corn266> buncha AU actin like this isn't the end orf their freedom
[04:54:00] <xe0n> in the rdp app
[04:54:02] <xe0n> thats how it works lol!
[04:54:09] <xe0n> same with windows

[04:54:46] <corn266> xe0n you go make some dogs with those truckers?
[04:54:51] <xe0n> ^ you can auto fill that stuff
[04:56:16] <xe0n> you should be explaining how to subscribe to the link
[04:56:26] <xe0n> so it populates their start menu with the desktop link and apps if you publish them
[04:56:31] <xe0n> there's no need for an rdp file lol
[04:57:11] <corn266> if i wantd a fucking youtbue channel i'd start one
[04:57:47] <corn266> my blacks with facts

[05:10:09] <rpifan> lol
[05:10:36] <xe0n> the benefit of the subscription link Work-BWMerlin is that if you update any of the server settings, the feed updates the client machines
[05:10:39] <sd> 13<C​olour> Like look I'll just always build like 5 science ships and optimize my scientists in an obvious way and build planets in the exact same way each time why can't I just template the order out so only have to set it once and not have too look after it repeatedly

[05:11:24] <sd> 13<C​olour> It's like I want to set a group policy for my planets and scientists and the manager/players are screeching because they want it done manually every time

[05:15:58] * gibby farts gibbyfarts.com
[05:20:08] <rpifan> lol
[05:20:18] <Work-BWMerlin> I like this subscription link idea
[05:20:20] <Work-BWMerlin> I will try
[05:20:42] <Work-BWMerlin> First re-write the URL, then update documentation, then push file/subscription
[05:20:45] <Work-BWMerlin> Sound good?
[05:21:33] <xe0n> well before i do any changes, i would confirm things are working correctly
[05:21:36] <xe0n> i.e. you can actually subscribe
[05:21:40] <xe0n> if you can't work out whats busted there
[05:22:02] <xe0n> it sounds like you're not across entirely how to configure it? so take a moment to learn how it works
[05:22:11] <xe0n> then determine the best way to communicate changes and what not
[05:22:49] <xe0n> staff are currently using the setup yeah? like they can connect?
[05:23:18] <Work-BWMerlin> I am absolutely not across how to configure it, though I did manage to get it working again (SSL cert)
[05:23:20] <xe0n> if so, then there's no rush putting out more instructions until you've confirmed exactly how it works and how you want them to connect
[05:23:25] <xe0n> remember you need to support this stuff...
[05:23:30] <xe0n> okay the cert is one thing...
[05:23:31] <xe0n> lol
[05:25:24] <Work-BWMerlin> There are no existing instructions
[05:25:48] <Work-BWMerlin> So I have made some (no one other than IT has them have I only made them like 20  minutes ago)
[05:26:38] <Work-BWMerlin> I do try and document/write guides, sure not everything is documented (and yes it should be) but I have made a start and try to make sure there is something
[05:27:18] <xe0n> yeah no sweat there dude
[05:27:34] <xe0n> so what im saying is before you distribute some doc to staff, make sure its exactly what you want
[05:27:35] <xe0n> and make sense
[05:27:45] <xe0n> if you're asking people to download .rdp files, errr there's a better way
[05:27:56] <xe0n> microsoft has already thought of this, they know that approach wouldn't work very well in the long run
[05:27:57] <xe0n> lol
[05:28:09] <xe0n> you make a change to the server, you bust that file, you'll have to tell people to re-download it
[05:28:14] <xe0n> where the feed subscription takes care of itself
[05:28:21] <xe0n> just need to confirm the bits and pieces to configure that are in place
[05:28:26] <xe0n> and if not, look into it...

[09:13:51] <TheJollyRoger> Yeah. Behind a set of bollards, but out there in the parking lot nonetheless.

[10:13:00] <Work-BWMerlin> And one of the DIMM's isn't happy
[10:13:01] <xe0n> well its telling you the exact slot haha
[10:13:08] <xe0n> DIM 4 for processor 1
[10:13:22] <xe0n> so keep an eye on it, first thing would be to shut the thing down, remove it from dimm, put it back in
[10:13:34] <xe0n> else if problem, log support case
[10:13:38] <xe0n> let whoever sort it out
[10:14:02] <Work-BWMerlin> Going back to "this is the be all and end all" that means business down time
[10:14:16] <xe0n> yep
[10:14:24] <xe0n> you...would do it when it suits the business?
[10:14:26] <xe0n> something something plan?
[10:15:59] <Work-BWMerlin> I am not salary and I don't get overtime
[10:16:09] <Work-BWMerlin> Business is not open on weekend
[10:16:11] <xe0n> then pre-organise it and say you need to do it after hours
[10:16:12] <xe0n> and make sure you get paid
[10:16:15] <xe0n> wait how are you not salary?!
[10:16:25] <Work-BWMerlin> Why would I be?
[10:16:33] <xe0n> oO you're full time employed?
[10:16:36] <Work-BWMerlin> Yes
[10:16:41] <xe0n> so you're on contract?
[10:16:43] <xe0n> or set hrs lol
[10:16:48] <xe0n> I dont get how you're not salary! lol
[10:17:00] <Work-BWMerlin> Only teachers are salary
[10:17:03] <xe0n> anyway...you just need to plan and let whoever know there's a possible hardware issue, you need to shut the box down to investigate
[10:17:03] <Hunterkll> xe0n: lotta places in the US are just hourly & don't allow overtime
[10:17:05] <xe0n> its not...that hard
[10:17:09] <xe0n> its...your job
[10:17:12] <Hunterkll> if you work it you legally have to get paid the overtime, but still
[10:17:17] <xe0n> Hunterkll: dont care how US works, this is aus
[10:17:17] <xe0n> lol
[10:17:19] <Hunterkll> they just tell you to gtfo and go home
[10:17:20] <Hunterkll> oh

[10:18:00] <xe0n> im surprised that other staff for the school arent on salary, thats weird lol!

[10:19:52] * csws only buys 1
[10:20:05] <csws> good thinking
[10:20:24] <csws> they call it redundancy because it isn't needed. that's what I've learned
[10:20:48] <sd> 02<r​yalln> when the server dies you have to drive it to the head office for them to fix on site
[10:20:59] <sd> 02<r​yalln> because it takes too long due to shitty internet
[10:21:23] <csws> lol
[10:21:35] <csws> I'll lug it onto a bus
[10:21:39] <csws> and then it'll probably be faster to do it over the net

[10:57:22] <xe0n> loll
[10:58:11] <Hunterkll> Windows Insiders with Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) enabled will not receive this build. There is an issue in this build that causes PCs to bugcheck continuously with WDAG enabled. We hope to have this fixed in the next flight.
[10:58:12] <Hunterkll> rip
[10:58:18] <Hunterkll> >continuously
[10:58:22] <Hunterkll> that doesnt sound like something i want

[10:59:27] <Hunterkll> so you already know what to expect lol
[10:59:40] <Hunterkll> only major change in new dev branch is fricken some SMB compression decision stuff
[10:59:53] <Hunterkll> plus all the fixes in the 22000 build 
[11:00:03] <xe0n> the main thing is that my audio settings dont reset after each update anymore :D
[11:00:15] <Hunterkll> xe0n: they will to the next dev build
[11:00:15] <Hunterkll> :P
[11:00:28] <Hunterkll> oh yea
[11:00:34] <Hunterkll> major change

[11:01:10] <Hunterkll> such imporrtant change
[11:01:29] <Hunterkll> The Windows startup sound will no longer play after an unattended update (aka a scheduled Windows update when you are not at your PC).

[11:01:56] <xe0n> yeah my surface has some sound it boots up with
[11:01:58] <xe0n> i heard it last night

[11:03:56] <Hunterkll> lol
[11:04:31] <csws> I had a laptop that was originally win 7 upgraded to 10 and it still played the 7 startup sound
[11:04:56] <Hunterkll> i mean that kinda makes sense

[11:06:16] <csws> yeah. was just kinda weird to hear

[21:19:33] <DrZak> i mean, a filled up 50L is a lot of weight for more than a 5-6 hrs walking a day

[21:20:15] <sd> 11<t​elgareith> @Phasey I'm just telling you it's personal preference as long as it's a namebrand and you don't buy some cheap junk
[21:20:27] <DrZak> both have a great trampoline system to reduce the back sweat
[21:20:55] <DrZak> but tbh. unless you plan weeklong expedition in cold wet weather, 75l seems overkill
[21:21:18] <sd> 06<P​hasey> the one i have now doesn't have a lot of compartments its Eddie Bauer
[21:21:28] <sd> 06<P​hasey> Its because im going from one job sometimes to another and then the gym
