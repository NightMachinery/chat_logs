[04:58:34] <Guest85> yea it definitely has something to do with sessions. The heroku logs command reads Destroyed session due to invalid change of remote host or user agent
[05:06:45] <schinckel> Guest85: Presumably you are using https://github.com/mxsasha/django-restricted-sessions, because that string shows up in their code.
[05:07:14] <schinckel> https://github.com/mxsasha/django-restricted-sessions/blob/master/restrictedsessions/middleware.py#L49
[05:07:36] <Guest85> yes i am
[05:07:49] <schinckel> Can you see which of the reasons is triggering it?
[05:08:05] <schinckel> ie, is it your IP address or user agent change that is causing the failure.
[05:08:19] *** Joins: noyb (~noyb@user/noyb)
[05:08:28] <schinckel> That seems like a dubious choice - mobile devices (and even others) can change IP addresses somewhat regularly.
[05:09:11] <schinckel> Switching between wifi networks, turning on/off VPN, DHCP changes, these can all change that.
[05:09:15] <Guest85> hmm well i have been on the same PC for 2 nights in a row but the PC would go to sleep
[05:09:28] <Guest85> i have been trying on firefox and chrome
[05:09:37] <schinckel> That's probably unlikely to be it. It could be you are on a dynamic IP address.
[05:09:48] <schinckel> So this doesn't happen on every request? Only occasionally?
[05:10:21] <Guest85> yes only occasionally
[05:10:47] <schinckel> Seems likely to be that then. Can you see if your external IP address changes frequently?
[05:10:51] <Guest85> like if i click any of the links on my heroku app it may or may not work
[05:11:03] <Guest85> I can't login at all
[05:11:10] <schinckel> (Personally, I'd be disabling that feature about changing IP addresses. I'm not sure of the security value of that)
[05:11:24] <Guest85> so disable restricted sessions?
[05:11:56] <schinckel> You can disable just the IP address checking - not sure what the other checks are, or how valuable they are.
[05:12:10] <schinckel> If you disable that package though, I believe it will fix your problem.
[05:12:27] <Guest85> my god i hope so you will be such a lifesaver if that was the problem
[05:12:48] <schinckel> I've never seen that package before.
[05:12:58] <Guest85> yea idk what caused me to download it
[05:13:01] <schinckel> I just searched for the error message, and that was the first result.
[05:13:07] <Guest85> did you use google search engine fu to find this?
[05:13:54] <schinckel> I don't use Google, only DuckDuckGo. But I just searched for the exact string (ie, put quotes around the error message you provided).
[05:14:19] <Guest85> Nice duckduckgo is good :)
[05:14:25] <schinckel> That's a tip - if you put double quotes around an error message you are searching for, search engines take that as a "match this exact string" directive.
[05:14:34] <Guest85> good idea ty
[05:15:41] <Guest85> holy smokes it seems to be working!
[05:15:53] <Guest85> You are the best schinckel :)

[05:17:18] <Guest85> another question - if you use heroku
[05:17:31] <schinckel> I don't, but ask anyway, because others might.
[05:17:35] <Guest85> ah ok
[05:18:02] <Guest85> my next problem was gmail not sending emails but it seems to have to do with actually using a paid mail addon
[05:18:31] <Guest85> i tried disabling gmail security so maybe i will try fastmail otherwise i have to pay a good chunk for sendgrid or mailgun
[05:18:37] <schinckel> FWIW, we use SparkPost for our transactional email stuff.
[05:18:45] <Guest85> ooh let me check that out

[05:21:02] <Guest85> yea a dedicated ip on sparkpost is 75 bucks
[05:21:10] <Guest85> same thing pretty much across the board
[05:23:09] <Guest85> i am so happy now about this restricted session thing :)
[05:23:40] <Guest85> wondering, how do you deploy your apps?
[05:23:56] <schinckel> We use an orchestration tool called "convox", which uses docker.
[05:24:31] <schinckel> It requires a bunch of configuration underneath it to set up AWS or other provider infrastructure.
[05:25:16] <Guest85> oh wow so it is like kubernetes?
[05:25:29] <schinckel> I think the newest version _uses_ kubernetes.
[05:25:36] <Guest85> oh it is a PaaS like heroku
[05:25:53] <schinckel> It gives you a bunch of tools to help with deployment, like managing updates/rollbacks/environment.
[05:25:59] <Guest85> why use convox and not heroku?
[05:26:25] <schinckel> Sort-of - but you provide the infrastructure. Which means it can be significantly less expensive at scale than heroku.
[05:26:56] <Guest85> how do you provide it? You configure the IaaS stuff yourself?
[05:27:27] <schinckel> Yeah, you configure the AWS bits and pieces you need - I think their newer stuff works with more cloud providers though. I'm not involved in that aspect of it.
[05:27:59] <schinckel> From my point of view I do something like `convox build ...`, and then `convox releases promote ...` or whatever.
[05:28:15] <schinckel> And it handles rolling updates to make sure we don't have downtime.
[05:34:57] <Guest85> wow sounds like a pretty good product
[05:35:20] <schinckel> Yeah, it's okay. I've not really tried many alternatives though.
[05:35:46] <Guest85> it doesn't say a cost though do you know how much you pay around?

[09:06:52] <PaulWay[w]> The only way I can see making a good 'backward compatible' versioned API is basically fork all your API classes into a new directory when you decide to move to v2, then make them serve the v2 directory endpoints.
[09:07:01] <tm007> We want to break out a monolith

[13:55:34] <FunkyBob> why do you need to use the uuids "in relations"?

[13:59:38] <pgcd> if I use UUIDs (and slugs, depending on models) I can simply switch off the constraints while copying the data over, and reactivate them later
[14:02:20] <pgcd> also, given the fact that ManyToManyFields are based on ForeignKeys, which support a to_field= kwarg, I don't really understand why M2M doesn't do that already, but that's my problem =)

[14:22:44] <pycode> FunkyBob, i really do not have "a problem" i mean, i have a lot of points, i never worked with big charts so i wonder what is the best way to handle "lazy loading" or something like that
[14:22:59] <pycode> with lazy loading i mean a way to avoid loading ALL 200k points with one request
[14:23:23] <pycode> i would like this operation be "trasparent" to the user..i do not want any block during chart scrolling
[14:23:39] <pycode> so i wonder what approach should i follow
[14:24:07] <FunkyBob> well.... first thing I'd check is how big is all 200k points in one response
[14:24:11] <FunkyBob> with compression enabled
[14:25:51] <jor> I think I said this before :) but I suspect rendering the points would be the bottleneck (but do profile that to make sure)
[14:28:07] <jor> with big chart, I resample the data (server side, preferably in database) to get less points to render. Then have zoom function to allow user to get higher resolution for a smaller range
[14:28:47] <FunkyBob> sounds sensible
[14:29:56] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: please, could you help me with my problem?
[14:30:00] <jor> the resolution depends on the data. Fften have datetime ranges, for which the year, month, week and day are natural 'resolutions' you can select based on the range the user selected

[14:41:39] <pycode> jor, hi!
[14:41:49] <pycode> unfortunately i cant
[14:41:55] <pycode> i need to show the correct timeframe
[14:42:03] <pycode> so i cannot aggregate/resample
[14:42:34] <pycode> so the things is the chart COULD BE (not always) max 200k points (each candle has 4 points, open/high/low/close)
[14:42:56] <FunkyBob> why can't you agggregate?
[14:43:14] <pycode> so i will follow what FunkyBob said, i will try to load everything...with one request and then see what happen, i maybe can load multiple chunks to complete the chart
[14:43:41] <pycode> FunkyBob, because it is a financial chart i need to show from what candle the trade has been made, so if i have 5 minutes timeframe
[14:43:53] <pycode> i cannot show the correct candle if i resample/aggregate
[14:44:02] <pycode> every candle has its timestamp
[14:44:08] <FunkyBob> it's already agregated over 5 minutes from what you say
[14:44:09] <pycode> i must show the complete chart
[14:44:11] <FunkyBob> why can't it be more?
[14:44:40] <FunkyBob> nobody has a big enough screen to get meaningful data from 200k samples
[14:45:12] <pycode> FunkyBob, because when you enter a trade, you have the symbol (eur/usd) for exampple, the timeframe (5 minutes) every candle is 5 minutes so when i need to see the history i must see from what candles have been used on trade
[14:45:20] <jor> yeah, there's no point in rendering 200k points... unless you have 200k screen :)
[14:45:21] <pycode> i can resample 5 min to 30 min
[14:45:30] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: please, help with my problem you are the only in this channel who always helped me. just tell me where to investigate to get my little problem fixed
[14:45:33] <pycode> FunkyBob, ahaha no no wait
[14:45:47] <pycode> i will add an horizontal scroll
[14:45:54] <pycode> the chart is 1024 less or more
[14:46:00] <pycode> (pixels)
[14:46:09] <bennib> funkybob, thanks. i use the abstract class with formtools. so i am not sure if it is a problem with formtools or with my code. my code is here: https://srcsrv.wikimedia.de/beba/foerderbarometer/src/branch/master/input/models.py error traceback points only to formtools code, so it is not very helpful in finding the class witch causes the trouble, but i think it is ExternView, because i use this in a WizardView (see view.py)
[14:46:11] <pycode> but with this horizontal scroll i need to show everything
[14:46:19] <pycode> all the historical prices of the chart
[14:46:23] <jor> well, if you scroll, you have an event to get the 'next' data
[14:47:08] <pycode> jor, yes the problem is to understand when to load data..i mean. if i load 200 points (instead of 200k) then when the user reach the 50th point i need to render a new chunk
[14:48:40] <pycode> the reason is because the user should not notice it
[14:48:49] <jor> pycode: usually you have a start/end window (or min/max), which moves when scrolling.
[14:49:17] <pycode> yes but i need to find a rule to understand when to do a new call
[14:49:17] <jor> you can 'prefetch' with that information, to also grab parts the are out of view
[14:50:11] <pycode> jor, exactly i need parts outside the view
[14:52:04] <jor> well, the 'when' would be onscroll, usually debounced (and the initial load).
[14:52:33] <FunkyBob> bennib: care to dpaste  the traceback?
[14:52:34] <jor> The what you get depends on the data, like I said, often a start and endt timestamp which the graph/viewport can pass to your data endpoint. And e.g you can make it prefect the next and previous 'pages'
[14:57:47] <bennib> FunkyBob, https://dpaste.org/wbPT (error comes if i load my first page in the browser)

[14:59:54] <wallbroken> we'll try to solve my problem once for all
[15:00:09] <FunkyBob> Extern is an abstract model
[15:00:16] <FunkyBob> which model did you actually want it to be a form for?
[15:00:56] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: you've not mentioned what the problem is... and not answered my other question... so things are already looking bad for you
[15:01:14] <FunkyBob> one of those frustrating things you do that you said you wanted to avoid? ignoring what I say...
[15:01:15] <wallbroken> your other question is if i did what you asked to me
[15:01:23] <wallbroken> and i know what you asked to me
[15:01:57] <FunkyBob> bennib: ?
[15:02:01] <bennib> FunkyBob Extern. The reason i used an abstract class here, is that the first form is the same for every derived modell class.
[15:02:19] <wallbroken> 1) have you done the tutorial? 2) have you switched to function view in stead of view class? 3) would you provide more details about your goal you need to reach?
[15:02:21] <FunkyBob> bennib: when a ModelForm is created it either receives or creates an instance of the model
[15:02:33] <wallbroken> are these the question you need an answer for?
[15:03:05] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: and as I've mentioned before, if you're serious about paying someone to do this work, you will need to give actual and clear details about your requirements. something you've been historically atrocious at
[15:03:10] <moldy> bennib: make a base form class with the things that are common and then subclass that form class
[15:04:06] <bennib> moldy that is what Extern is for. So you think i can just remove the abstract=True from Extern and everything is fine?
[15:04:14] <FunkyBob> bennib: no
[15:04:54] <moldy> bennib: i know you think that this is what Extern is for. i'm telling you this doesn't work ;)
[15:05:18] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: yes, i contacted a freelancer online
[15:05:20] <moldy> bennib: you *think* the forms are the same, but they are actually *not*. they need to instantiate different models.
[15:05:22] <bennib> moldy i know :) but it worked fine with 3.1
[15:05:27] <wallbroken> i asked to me for 1000 $
[15:05:38] <wallbroken> but it's a little problem i want to solve by myself
[15:05:43] <wallbroken> very little problem
[15:05:47] <moldy> bennib: then rolling back to 3.1 is also an option i guess
[15:05:55] <wallbroken> it's stupid to pay that money for that
[15:06:02] <moldy> bennib: if you want to share code among your forms, use a form base class
[15:06:19] <wallbroken> but here you were the only people which helped me
[15:06:25] <wallbroken> but now you stopped doing it at all
[15:06:40] <bennib> moldy yes, i have done this in production, but it would be fine to have the code working with the latest django stable
[15:06:53] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: and now you're waffling on about bullshit instead of answering questions... making me want even less to help you
[15:06:56] <moldy> bennib: this may actually be a problem with formtools, not with django (not sure)
[15:07:08] <moldy> bennib: but the traceback shows pretty clearly that it will *not* work like this
[15:07:22] <moldy> bennib: you can probably keep your models as they are. just make one form class with the common stuff, then subclass it and override Meta.model or whatever needs to be different
[15:07:33] <FunkyBob> moldy: no, it looks like formtools is behaving an trying to get an instance of the form class
[15:07:51] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i explained you what my goal is the last time
[15:08:03] <wallbroken> and you told me that my explanation is good
[15:08:15] <wallbroken> then you stopped helping me
[15:08:21] <wallbroken> so i tried to do it on my own
[15:08:39] <moldy> FunkyBob: hmm, it looks like django (/django/forms/models.py", line 298, in __init__) is trying to instantiate the model, so the model bust be concrete
[15:08:44] <wallbroken> but now the problem is that i'm unable to make the view getting the form
[15:08:51] <moldy> bennib: so just give it a concrete model
[15:09:37] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: wow, 45 minutes and we're finally starting to hear what it is you want help with...
[15:10:12] <FunkyBob> bennib: what does your code do once it's all sorted? does it switch models based on some user selection?
[15:10:17] <wallbroken> yes, i explained many times before
[15:10:17] <FunkyBob> i didn't look closely
[15:10:21] <wallbroken> i created a view class
[15:10:30] <wallbroken> that takes the form
[15:10:42] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: "i explained many times" ... and I ignored you because I'm done with helping you
[15:10:56] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: but NOBODY ELSe can help you either, beucase you never explained the problem you wanted help with
[15:10:58] <bennib> FunkyBob, yes. in the first form user selects the modell and than the wizard switches forms.
[15:11:19] <pycode> jor, do you think we need a library to create a scroll bar?
[15:11:23] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: sorry, but that's false. i explained it many times in the past days

[15:13:59] <bennib> moldy, thanks! i will try this approach
[15:14:04] <FunkyBob> I was trying  to kick you from the channel to end your spamming
[15:14:42] <moldy> wallbroken: don't paste code here, use dpaste.org or such
[15:14:46] <wallbroken> so, the question is: have you an idea on why the form isn't valid and i never enter that method?

[15:15:03] *** Quits: Crassus (~Crassus@user/crassus) (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
[15:15:47] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: as I keep telling you... but you ignore me every time... you would have a much easier time following what's going on [and thus debugging it] if you used plain function views
[15:15:59] <FunkyBob> but you don't listen... and lie too much... so I don't help you
[15:16:10] <moldy> bennib: actually, making BaseForm a mixin might be the cleaner approach
[15:16:27] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: and I told you that the class was already there
[15:16:43] <FunkyBob> bennib: I was trying to think of a way you could creat a non-model form class from the model
[15:16:47] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: so fucking what?
[15:16:48] <wallbroken> i created it many time before you were suggesting me to use a plain function
[15:16:55] <wallbroken> but. given that
[15:16:56] <serafeim> also you can read my cbv guide to understand CBVs better: https://spapas.github.io/2018/03/19/comprehensive-django-cbv-guide/
[15:17:05] <wallbroken> now i'm curious to know why the form isn't validated
[15:17:07] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: it hasn't helped you understand anything better
[15:17:12] <wallbroken> have you an idea of why?
[15:17:22] <wallbroken> there is something wrong in the code?
[15:17:31] <wallbroken> please could you provide any help about that?
[15:17:37] <jor> if it was 'already there', you should ask the person who added it :/
[15:17:52] <FunkyBob> jor: pointless... they added it themself
[15:18:03] <jor> FunkyBob: exactly ;p
[15:18:12] <wallbroken> well, i should ask to ginFuYou
[15:18:13] <FunkyBob> jor: and yet another reason I've given up helping them is they retain almost no memory of their prior work...
[15:18:18] <wallbroken> he told me to use it
[15:18:28] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: fin, ask them then... and leave me alone
[15:18:56] <wallbroken> but why you don't want to tell me why that form isn't validated?
[15:19:05] <wallbroken> we would finish this pain many time before
[15:19:10] <serafeim> i explained before that nobody is obliged to help anybody here. asking particular persons to help you is not a good practice
[15:19:30] <serafeim> the proper way is to ask a question and if anybody wants they'll answer
[15:19:39] <wallbroken> please ALL THE PEOPLE WHO NEVER HELPED ME MUST SHUT UP!
[15:19:45] <serafeim> lol
[15:20:10] <serafeim> wallbroken: i also explained before that helping you does not give people a special talking status
[15:20:20] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: yeah,  you should think more about that
[15:20:32] <FunkyBob> why everyone who has tried helping you... gives up on trying to help you
[15:20:38] <wallbroken> serafeim:  i don't care in listening your opinion
[15:21:07] <wallbroken> i talk only with FunkyBob becaouse he is the one who entirely helped me frome the beginning
[15:21:08] <serafeim> i just explained some IRC netiquette. polite people try to follow it
[15:21:42] <serafeim> all right whatever
[15:21:55] <wallbroken> NOBODY of other people here never helped me
[15:22:14] <wallbroken> and that's the reason why when i talk here i directly point to FunkyBob
[15:22:15] <jor> pretty much every day somebody else tries... they just give up after a couple of follow up questions
[15:22:19] <FunkyBob> probably because they saw how frustrating it was for me to try
[15:22:36] <bennib> moldy, FunkyBob many thanks! it looks like it works now.
[15:22:49] <FunkyBob> bennib: sweet... what was your solution?
[15:23:03] <wallbroken> the frist times i came here FunkyBob directly prepared me the code. now i just ask something else
[15:23:11] <wallbroken> i just ask to some hint to fix my problem
[15:23:18] <thiras> is it ok to use GenericForeignKey instead of an intermediate model to hold the FK with the subclasses?
[15:23:23] <wallbroken> and now my problem is why that view is not validating the form
[15:23:23] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: sure, but the first time you came in here you lied, saying you'd done the tutorial
[15:23:34] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: i did that!!!!
[15:23:45] <dodo> i tried once. was told pointing to relevant documention wasn't helpful
[15:23:50] <wallbroken> i don't care you trust me or not. but i red that
[15:23:53] <FunkyBob> and now even as I try to help you, you keep ignoring my help
[15:24:07] <wallbroken> your help is still "switch to basic function" ?
[15:24:07] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: you admitted at the time you hadn't done it

[15:57:43] <FunkyBob> bennib: i was looking at hwo you might leverage fields_for_model to create  a Form, not ModelForm, from your model
[15:58:47] <bennib> hm. ok. sounds complicated :/
[15:59:54] <FunkyBob> alternatively, you could pick one of the other models, and list only the shared fields
[15:59:58] <bennib> i still do not understand why the old code worked in 3.1. why was it ok to instantiate abstract classes in the first place?
[16:00:08] <FunkyBob> which you can ask the abstract model's _meta for the names of
[16:00:15] <FunkyBob> it wasn't
[16:00:20] <FunkyBob> it was just never warned about before
[16:01:17] <bennib> hm. but it worked. so why did 3.2. not just issue a warning instead of an error?
[16:01:56] <FunkyBob> you'd have to ask whomever added it

[16:04:32] <wallbroken> FunkyBob: see? you also stopp answering to me?

[16:05:29] <FunkyBob> not polite is you expecting people here to help you
[16:05:45] <FunkyBob> not polite is you lying to us, saying you've done thing you did not.
[16:06:02] <FunkyBob> not polite is you expecting people to do the work, and not making the efforts yourself to _understand_ what you are doing
[16:06:29] <wallbroken> oh man... i'm trying to debug the problem i have since weeks
[16:06:29] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: so if you want to think I'm not polite, I dno't care any more... stop asking me to help you
[16:06:35] <FunkyBob> yeah, I know
[16:06:49] <FunkyBob> and you fail to understand so many basic concepts, it will be almost impossible
[16:07:26] <wallbroken> so, what do i need to do? stay here hoping that somebody will have the patience to help me?
[16:07:40] <wallbroken> i'm not able to help myself
[16:07:41] <FunkyBob> once again you miss the point

[16:07:53] <FunkyBob> you just copy them and use t hem
[16:07:57] <wallbroken> no
[16:08:02] <wallbroken> i applied a logic
[16:08:04] <FunkyBob> as I told you from the start... don't use ANY code you don't understand
[16:08:07] <wallbroken> but that logic isn't working
[16:08:17] <FunkyBob> applied logic... you admitted yourself you made nonsense random changes
[16:08:17] <wallbroken> that code was made by myself
[16:08:28] <FunkyBob> have you converted that view to a function yet?
[16:08:29] <FunkyBob> no?
[16:08:40] <wallbroken> i don't know how to
[16:09:01] <FunkyBob> so go do the tutorial again, until you understand how a view function works
[16:09:10] <FunkyBob> then look at the documentation again, about using a formset in a view
[16:09:20] <wallbroken> what a view function is?
[16:09:23] <wallbroken> who calls that?
[16:09:29] <wallbroken> chich parameters gets in?
[16:09:56] <wallbroken> why should i use that instead a view class?
[16:10:14] <FunkyBob> wallbroken: because, as I told you several times... it will help you understand what's happening

[16:10:51] <wallbroken> do you remember we already did that?
[16:11:05] <wallbroken> and it won't work because it needed some javascript part on the client side?
[16:11:16] <wallbroken> because it was based on using url post request?
[16:11:32] <FunkyBob> that doesn't logically track
[16:11:33] <wallbroken> that's why i want to switch to form based
[16:11:44] <wallbroken> because i want a checkbox, in a form
[16:11:52] <wallbroken> and the view must get that checkbox
[16:12:00] <FunkyBob> yeah, still not interested in helping you any more...
[16:12:04] <wallbroken> and basing on it's state, enable/disable the m2m

[17:00:37] <pycode> jor, maybe i am wrong but, when i see scrollbar on charts i always found that is a kind of small view of the chart with the big one on the background...so i do not know...because in my case i do not have the big chart i have to "create" (load points) it during the scroll

[17:01:51] <pycode> it is my previous library...however it has the range
[17:01:59] <pycode> BUT i do not have all the points
[17:02:06] <pycode> so i cannot build a ranger that way
[17:02:33] <pycode> i think i only need a slider (i have just seen that bootstrap has some sliders)
[17:02:39] <pycode> and then manage them to load more points
[17:04:08] <domhnall> Is 'Trac' developed with Django? I
[17:04:09] <jor> pycode: ahh, yeah, you could have a slider 'outside' the main graph canvas and use that as input

[17:09:37] <domhnall> FunkyBob: Thanks, I see.
[17:10:10] <domhnall> FunkyBob: But of course, one can do a similar tracker using Django, yeah?
[17:11:28] <FunkyBob> absolutely
[17:11:40] <FunkyBob> and there's a more advanced project  management tool out there based on django

[17:19:40] <pycode> the slider will just give me the "point" then i have to put a logic that take care of:    1) the data i already have loaded      2) the missing pieaces
[17:19:49] <pycode> jor, do you have a strategy for the point number 2? :D
[17:21:20] <pycode> jor, i am thinking another thing too... what if i provide ALL the points (maybe gzip).... but just render a small piece of it ?
[17:21:48] <pycode> i maybe lets suppose i have a cache that avoid additional db calls... put everything inside a json and cache it
[17:22:09] <pycode> (as i said yesterday my data changes one time a day, so after that change i can cache "everything")
[17:22:15] <jor> pycode: the 'point' should be a range, so the missing pieces is just combining the 'cached' range and the newly requests range
[17:23:18] <pycode> what do you think?

[17:25:51] <jor> pycode: yeah, sure i'd also build if first with 'all' the points, to get it working. Only then bother with optimizing it. The caching is mainly in the javascript here, gotta keep track of the ranges there
[17:26:09] <pycode> jor, what do you think about the solution i wrote? i mean... if i have a json (cache json) i can gzip compress it as much as possible and provide it to the user....BUT to avoid redering problem i just can render a small portion of it
[17:26:57] <pycode> jor, i just see only one single point range https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/forms/#range
[17:26:59] <pycode> hmmm
[17:27:28] <jor> pycode: yeah, that'll work. if it's cached (so no db query) and gziped those 200k points should not be a big problem
[17:28:12] <pycode> exactly
[17:28:29] <pycode> but with bootstrap i do not find a range with boundaries, possible?
[17:28:39] <pycode> and i also need to set the max range width
[17:31:31] <jor> pycode: yeah, that bootstrap component won't do. Need some differnent input component that supports a rande with a start and end point
[17:31:38] <jor> pycode: something like https://refreshless.com/nouislider/
