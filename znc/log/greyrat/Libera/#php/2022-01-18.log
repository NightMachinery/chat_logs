[04:01:47] <relipse> i'm using the snake oil cert
[04:01:50] <relipse> that comes with apache
[04:02:36] <Byteflux> It will work in Chrome, when you tell your webserver to use the certs that mkcert generated, and also if you tell mkcert to install those certs into your OS certificate truststore.

[09:03:26] <gde33> I have never restored a db backup but would like to know how to. I currently export the sql using the quick option. What do I do if the db stops working?

[09:04:46] <gde33> ah found a tutorial
[09:08:29] <gde33> delete the old db, make a new one with the same name, import
[09:09:03] <jargon> .__.
[09:16:13] <TML> exporting the SQL seems like a pretty crude form of backup
[09:16:32] <gde33> how else do it?
[09:17:50] <TML> volume snapshots, filesystem-level backups, point-in-time recovery pointsâ€¦

[09:23:05] <gde33> db's seem to serve so many use cases it would seem hard to optimize for everything. My db is < 400 kb that seems small enough to [at least in theory] rule out crashes?
[09:24:11] <gde33> or it makes me non-audience? haha
[09:26:59] <tw2113> 400kb is tiny
[09:34:16] <TML> for a 400kb database, I'd probably use SQLite and move all the "backup" to a filesystem-level operation
[09:34:36] <TML> YMMV
[09:35:15] <gde33> I think I'm just going to manually make a json file with every update.

[22:30:16] <supremekai> Hey guys, I'm using redirect($url) as a way of downloading CSV, XLSX, ZIP files and everything worked well 'till I redirected to a XML file with extension GPX as in: redirect(www.site.com/file.gpx); instead of downloading the file it prompts the file to the user; thus, how can I force the download of an XML in PHP?

[22:39:38] <tirnanog> you can't force a user-agent to download a file without prompting. ultimately, it will handle the content in whatever way it sees fit, though you might be able to influence it's decision if you own the server for www.site.com.
[22:42:25] <tirnanog> in particular, and if it's under your control, make sure the resource in question isn't being presented with a header suggesting that the mime type is "application/octet-stream", rather than "application/xml" or "text/xml".
[22:42:37] <tirnanog> or, indeed, anything other than the latter two mime types.
[22:44:22] <tirnanog> (that may be a http server configuration issue, depending on whether the resource is static or dynamically generated).
[22:44:53] <supremekai> tirnanog, thank you very much! Besides the use of "application/octet-stream" what would you recommend? Shouldn't I use redirect to download a file?
[22:45:19] <tirnanog> you seem to be overlooking the fact that the user-agent follows the redirect by issuing a fresh request.
[22:45:32] *** Quits: WishBoy (~WishBoy@user/wishboy) ()
[22:46:08] <tirnanog> at best, the response to this new request might influence the behaviour. so, ideally, you need to be the person in charge of www.site.com.
[22:46:55] <tirnanog> but even if you're not, you could use curl -I to try and see how the request is being handled.
[22:47:08] <tirnanog> curl -L -I, more like it.
[22:48:28] <supremekai> tiranog, for a couple of reasons I'm using an iframe at another website
[22:48:38] <supremekai> and I do the redirect inside the iframe
[22:48:43] <tirnanog> as for the rest of your question, I already inferred that the correct mime type for XML is either of application/xml or text/xml.
[22:49:09] <supremekai> but in the sense of understanding files download, do you advise other function instead of redirect(www.site.com/file.ext) to get it?
[22:49:24] <supremekai> something like download(www.site.com/file.ext) exists? I'm a newbie in PHP
[22:49:48] <tirnanog> it's not about PHP but about HTTP and user-agent behaviour.
[22:50:04] <tirnanog> use curl to debug the request in question.
[22:50:23] <supremekai> Yup, I'm not very familiar with mime types, but what I got from your suggestion is the use of "application/octet-stream" so that the browser understands it is a file transfer
[22:50:34] <supremekai> oh, I get it
[22:50:36] <tirnanog> no.
[22:50:56] <supremekai> like, the curl of the "Network" tab in the browser may be exported, but in what sense would it help?
[22:51:03] <tirnanog> I mean, yes, if it's application/octet-stream, it usually results in a download prompt. but you're saying that's not what you want, unless I misunderstood you.
[22:51:14] <supremekai> I do want that :P
[22:51:25] <supremekai> Sorry for the lack of comm skills :P
[22:51:58] <supremekai> tirnanog, thank you very much! I will check the "application/octet-stream" related to downloads in google to gather more info
[22:51:59] <tirnanog> ok. anyway, debug the request first. I mean the command-line utility, curl, to be clear.
[22:52:00] <supremekai> Thanks for the tip!
[22:52:17] <tirnanog> you're putting the cart before the horse if you don't even analyse the response to the request.
[22:52:19] <supremekai> Yup, I will also do that in the Network tab of Chrome to export the curl
[22:53:18] <supremekai> Yup, you're right tirnanog :)
[22:53:28] <tirnanog> curl -L -I <url> should be a good place to start.
[22:53:37] <supremekai> Will start by doing that!
[22:53:40] * supremekai bows to tirnanog 
[22:53:45] <supremekai> Thank you very much! :)
[22:54:43] <guido> you can also check the response headers directly in chrome's network tab
[22:55:19] <supremekai> yup guido :)
[22:55:47] <supremekai> ty guido for you intervention! :)
[22:59:53] <tirnanog> to understand it better, look for the headers Content-Type and Content-Disposition in the response headers.

[23:36:58] <Koopz> sometimes i wonder if i'm just stupid or if framework devs intentionally leave out information on how to make things work with each other out of the docs so they can rake in consulting fees

[23:39:24] <TML> Koopz: That's a false dichotomy - there are so many other possible reasons; like you choose a bad framework; the developers haven't gotten around to writing documentation yet; the developers are bad at documentation in general; etc.
[23:39:55] <noord> Koopz: their intention is covering parts as much as possible, making it integratable is tough.
[23:39:58] <Koopz> you're right... i suppose i shouldn't complain since i barely even write comments myself

[23:41:23] <Koopz> me, 1 month later: "what the fuck is this?"
[23:42:01] <Sammitch> I'm doing a hard fork of my ansible repo, hand-porting stuff over and going over it with a fine-toothed comb, and more than once I've had to add a comment like "I don't remember _exactly_ why this is here, but if it isn't there are problems"
[23:42:16] <Sammitch> and I was the one that originally identified the problems and put that thing there :P
[23:42:41] <Koopz> have you checked the commit messages? maybe they have more information :>
[23:42:52] <TML> noord: I didn't say it wasn't a valid criticism; in fact, I provided several plausible reasons it might be true. I was simply taking issue with Koopz's implication that the only possible reasons are that 1) Koopz is stupid; or 2) The framework devs intentionally didn't document well so they could charge Koopz consulting fees.
[23:44:43] <Sammitch> Koopz: "disable IPv6, interferes with K8s networking" aka "if this isn't here to disable IPv6, then problems" :P
[23:45:09] <Sammitch> I am truly a font of retroactively useless information

[23:46:11] <relipse> if (session_id() == ''){ session_start(); } <-- does that make sense
[23:46:34] <Sammitch> XY problem

[23:47:37] <noord> relipse: session_status()?
[23:50:25] <Sammitch> the fact that you're not sure if a session is started or not is itself the problem that should be resolved
