[00:12:24] <mfiano> Amazing, I did it
[00:13:24] <harwiltz> Hello all. For some reason, when I run ansi-term with zsh (even with an empty .zshrc), after I type a few characters the cursor always moves to the next line. So if my prompt is more than ~5 characters long, there's a line break in the prompt. Also after the line break it's like as if the cursor moves backwards a few characters, so when I start typing I start overwriting a couple of the trailing
[00:13:26] <harwiltz> characters in my prompt. Anyone know what can be happening? 
[00:14:01] <harwiltz> I guess I should also mention that I frequently use zsh, and I only have this issue within emacs. Last I checked multi-term had the same problem.

[01:06:54] <mfiano> Basically I'm confused about what the :option macro does better than setq. It seems to expand to quite a bit more
[01:07:01] <acdw> o yeah you don't have to load shit
[01:07:06] <mfiano> coo
[01:07:32] <acdw> mfiano: afaik the customize system can also define setters and getters, so sometimes it can allow setting a variable to /do/ something
[01:07:58] <acdw> what, idk, and i've switched my config from use-package :custom blocks to setq to setup's :option with like, the same functionality
[01:08:08] <acdw> so it's just ... a e s t h e t i c s i guess
[01:08:27] <mfiano> But my question is why use :option over normal setq/setq-default/whatever for regular old variables that shouldn't have side-effects?
[01:08:49] <acdw> i like doing (append list) value
[01:08:50] <acdw> sometimes
[01:08:50] <mfiano> hmm ok
[01:09:02] <acdw> but like, really, no reason, lol
[01:09:07] <acdw> thought about using setf
[01:09:11] <acdw> htought about a lot of things
[01:09:30] <acdw> maybe i should do a full overhall changing :option to setq, then set ', then setf, then ..
[01:09:34] <acdw> to see if there's a difference at all
[01:09:53] <mfiano> Personally I prefer 1 setq form per variable setting rather than (setq a 1 b 2 ...). Takes up less horizontal space and easier to eval etc :)

[12:09:26] <holycow> when i startup slime, the *inferior-lisp* buffer fills up with all kinds of style-warning errors
[12:09:50] <holycow> and the command prompt is never released so that i can type in forms and execute them

[15:40:34] <mfiano> You used nimlang right?
[15:40:48] <krux02> yes
[15:40:56] <krux02> I worked on the compiler
[15:41:05] <mfiano> We talked on the voice server (mumble) about your opengl live coding stuff

[15:41:18] <elph> nice, I really like Nim
[15:41:34] <krux02> elph: what is it you like about Nim?
[15:41:40] <mfiano> and we always knocked on the lead dev for making it so unstable
[15:42:22] <krux02> mfiano: well my highest priority was stability for nim. Stability through cutting features that nobody maintained.
[15:42:30] <leah2> i use a language which uses matching ( { [ brackets... can i somehow insert the proper closing one by pressing the same key?
[15:42:33] <mfiano> Nim is a nice idea, but it is managed by a moron imo
[15:42:59] <krux02> leah2: there are modes for atomatic matching braces, so yes
[15:43:07] <krux02> mfiano: yes
[15:43:08] <leah2> i dont want them automatic
[15:43:18] <leah2> i just want to press ) and insert a ] if that would have been right
[15:43:46] <krux02> leah2: well you can write your own mode for that
[15:43:51] <krux02> should not be too complicated.
[15:44:13] <krux02> use a keymap for you mode that remaps those three keys to a function that inserts the right brace

[15:44:23] <leah2> not entirely trivial, you need to scan over matching pairs etc
[15:44:51] <krux02> leah2: there is something already made for you
[15:44:57] <krux02> let me look it up
[15:45:38] <krux02> get information about syntax-ppss
[15:45:43] <elph> I bought the Nim in Action (the EAP) sometime ago and didn't know anything about the language. As I learned I found it a cool mixture of Pascal (which I like, call me weird) and Python, if that makes any sense
[15:46:13] <elph> it was a toss up between Crystal, Nim and Go for side projects

[15:46:31] <elph> I ended up picking Nim for a lot of them
[15:46:58] <krux02> elph: it happened to me that some random guy on the internet gave me the book for free
[15:47:19] <krux02> I never read it, because at the time it came out, its information was outdated for me
[15:47:31] <mfiano> elph: The problem with Nim is it was made "1.0" in an attempt to gather users. It doesn't reflect stability at all. Infact, the lead dev uses it as his playground for exploratory new ideas, hence the 7 garbage collectors, etc, over fixing bugs. Infact he got into several arguments with krux02 over refusing to fix some bugs.
[15:47:42] <krux02> mfiano: 100% correct

[15:50:28] <elph> Yeah, I guess I never used for work, production or anything other than hobby so I wasn't really bothered about stability. I imagine other people don't feel like that.
[15:50:58] <mfiano> The compiler is hacks on top of hacks. It doesn't reflect good compiler theory
[15:51:03] <krux02> leah2: it is also not that heard to just scan backwords and look for the last open and unclosed brace.
[15:51:09] <mfiano> I can't recommend it for even playing around
[15:51:18] <EdwardIII> crystal is a type layer over ruby right? or is it independent from ruby now?
[15:51:26] <mfiano> independent
[15:51:26] <leah2> krux02: yeah but i need a stack then etc
[15:51:39] <krux02> elph: I used it for a bigger personal project and I constantly hit limits and bugs.
[15:51:54] <elph> ah, I remember another cool thing about Nim. I wanted to run stuff on early Raspberry Pi and having C emitted was really handy :)
[15:52:06] <EdwardIII> time for a rewrite in elisp krux02 
[15:52:16] <elph> For Crystal I would have to have LLVM or something on a tiny RasPi -_-
[15:52:28] <krux02> you simply can't rely on Nim, I mean the bugs that I hit were fixed, but there are many more still hidden that will stop you
[15:52:54] <krux02> EdwardIII: elisp is too slow and lacks static typing
[15:53:01] <EdwardIII> i was just kidding :)
[15:53:06] <EdwardIII> static typing is essential for you though?

[16:09:01] <mfiano> I am sorry to hear that.
[16:09:23] <krux02> but yes an independent standard is very very valuable and it should be aimed for
[16:09:56] <krux02> but I don't think it is possible to start a language with an indemendent standard
[16:10:43] <mfiano> There is no need to 'start a language' if the work has already been done. People go to great trouble to avoid learning Common Lisp, to their own demise.
[16:11:02] <krux02> so if there is money on the table a company might be in the position to demand an independent standard definition of the language.
[16:11:04] <mfiano> It is such an easy language to learn. There really is no excuse.
[16:11:18] <krux02> it would certainly prevent situations that caused my ban
[16:11:28] <elph> krux02: love it or hate it (most probably) isn't that what Javascript does? i.e. first ECMA then implementation?
[16:11:54] <krux02> elph: maybe now
[16:12:00] <krux02> but it certainly didn't start that way
[16:12:09] <krux02> it was just a language with just an implementation
[16:12:21] <krux02> and I also don't think it should be standardized first.
[16:12:36] <elph> krux02: for sure, but now it seems like ECMA where stuff is discussed
[16:12:44] <krux02> I think exploring the implementation first is important. otherwise you end up with requirements that nobody can implement

[16:14:12] <intothewild> thblt: I used "helm" but with "helm-comp-read" I get the correct behavior, thanks

[16:16:50] <krux02> I remember that it is also stupid there there are two types of 'standard'
[16:17:21] <krux02> one that every compiler implements (inofficial) and one that is dictated as the specification that not everybody implemented (yet)
[16:17:33] <krux02> example being #pragma once
[16:17:58] <krux02> it is there, every compiler I know knows about it. It is very useful, but it just won't become a standard featuere
[16:19:38] <krux02> and then there was the c++98 export feature that only one compiler implemented, it was a hell amount of an effort. The compiler developers who eventually implemented it votede against that feauter because they knew it was a pain in the ass to implement. And then it was removed because nobody else could implement it.
[16:20:09] <elph> Perhaps the Java folks are onto something :P  With the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Compatibility_Kit Everyone can make a "Java" as long as it passes the TCK. If you want to implement extra bell and whistles, go for it (as long as it still passes the TCK).
[16:20:40] <hodapp> allll I know is, I'm glad C++ seemingly graduated past the idiotic '90s-style "use shitty OOP for everything" stage

[16:21:26] <hodapp> it's not? I figured it still was
[16:21:39] <hodapp> just no longer as literally the only box of abstractions you can/should use
[16:21:50] <krux02> and that is in my opinion also wher Nim really shines, because it never distinguished between free and member functions.
[16:22:27] <hodapp> in Go it's a rather minimal distinction where it's like they make it clear it's just sugar
[16:23:06] <krux02> hodapp: if you use classes for everything with vtables, and then put smart pointers everywhere with ref counting, then you are better off to develop directly in Java
[16:23:43] <hodapp> one thing I liked in Rust is that it makes it explicit whether what you're doing is going to incur the lookup of something like a vtable or not
[16:24:05] <krux02> if that is your style of programming, you clearly don't care about the performance of c++, And therefore the biggest reason to endure the c++ warts just vanishes.
[16:24:33] <praevalens> I try to refresh package archives with "(ignore-errors (package-refresh-contents))" within my init.el . But it throws an error when I'm not connected to the internet. Why is that ?
[16:26:13] <hodapp> my gripe when working on a big C++ GUI application is how much time and complexity was devoted to getting basically late-binding and circumventing the type hierarchy they made
[16:26:15] <krux02> hodapp: what I like about Go is, functions are just functions, and objects don't have vtables. But if you put them into the interface tuple, then the object is paired with a vtable. In other words the vtable is only added to an object, if it really really is requested in that context.

[16:47:54] <bpalmer> so foo's exception handler looks like it should stop termination but it fails.

[17:48:00] <lokesh1197> yes its great in restclient
[17:48:06] <grym> i use the org integration for some quick and dirty tests; this confused my teammates thoroughly :)

[17:48:15] <grym> "what is this text file and how did you DO that" 
[17:48:27] <lokesh1197> but is there any way to do like that in the verb pacakge?
[17:48:44] <lokesh1197> i moved over to verb as I need to parse the respone sometimes for the token
[17:48:55] <cvandusen> I messed with verb a while ago and could never get the hang of it. I'll stick with restclient.

[17:52:49] <lokesh1197> in restclient there is no need for that
[17:53:09] <cvandusen> I don't know verb to be able to speak to that. If it was me, I'd just find some way to wrap the needed functionality around restclient. Ultimately, it's just make network requests.
[17:55:14] <lokesh1197> I will probably do that once I get accustomed to elisp

[23:53:59] <krux02> I have some problems with my recompile command
[23:54:09] *** Joins: OxBADCODEC (~sphinx@user/businessclass)
[23:54:26] <krux02> if I rememebr correctly it did work correctly in the past but now it keeps to forget the compile command
[23:54:30] <krux02> this is my implementation

[23:55:30] <krux02> the idea is, I once set the compile command and then I can just recompile from whereever I am

[23:55:48] <krux02> but for some reason, since an update at some unknown time (I didn't use it for some months)

[23:56:05] <krux02> it just doesn't remember the compile command
[23:56:22] <krux02> make -k 
[23:56:25] <krux02> make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
[23:56:42] <krux02> make -k is the default, it is not the command that I entered
[23:56:48] <krux02> any ideas why this is the case
[23:56:51] <krux02> ?
[23:57:31] <rpav> dunno i use my own thing for that stuff
