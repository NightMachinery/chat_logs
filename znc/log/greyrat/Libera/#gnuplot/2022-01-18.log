[17:59:42] <jaggz> I'm using perl to pipe some gnuplot commands into gnuplot
[17:59:56] <jaggz> the last command after a plot is pause mouse any;
[18:00:14] <jaggz> that's nice, lets me see the plot, but I want to interact with the plot (select areas and zoom, etc.)
[18:00:41] <jaggz> I tried "pause -1;" but it closes right away.. gnuplot shuts down
[18:01:41] <jaggz> here's my perl script.. not sure if it matters: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/438d9310/
[18:16:38] <jaggz> fixed

[22:43:18] <gaude> i have gnuplot with noraise running in some loop, i can put other terminals in the background but copy pasting from them does not seem to work, as soon as i mark text it gets unmarked a second later
[22:43:21] <gaude> any ideas?
