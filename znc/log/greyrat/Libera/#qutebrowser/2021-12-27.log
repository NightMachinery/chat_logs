[05:12:15] <noex> ah content.blocking.whitelist (Current: ["*://click.e.progressive.com/*"]) there we go
[05:13:07] <noex> no clue why an insurance policy website is getting blocked. sounds like a regular expression issue.
[05:15:41] <noex> oh, it's not. it's literally hardcoded in there. that's strange.
[05:15:45] <MacGyver> noex: The issue is probably the clicktracker.
[05:15:56] <MacGyver> noex: Try going directly to www.progressive.com and you'll find it's not blocke.
[05:15:58] <MacGyver> blocked*
[05:16:12] <noex> i realize, but the password reset URLs they send all have that format
[05:16:16] <MacGyver> Yes well.
[05:16:27] <MacGyver> Open them in a temporary basedir.
[05:16:48] <MacGyver> (Or accept the clicktracking.)
[05:16:56] <MacGyver> But I prefer the -T route.
[05:17:34] <noex> i assume the click is being tracked so the URL expires after you use it?
[05:18:11] <MacGyver> Hah.
[05:18:28] <MacGyver> Have you *been* on the internet?
[05:18:54] <noex> nope, never have before
[05:19:42] <MacGyver> Just for a laugh, try opening the URL twice. I'd actually bet it just works until you do reset your password using it.
[05:20:26] <MacGyver> The click tracking is more likely just tacked onto every URL in every outgoing e-mail, to see how their mailings perform.
[05:20:31] <noex> nope, it works only once. the next click says it's expired.
[05:20:41] <MacGyver> Well colour me impressed.
[05:20:50] <noex> it's to reset your password.  you literally REQUEST this email
[05:20:51] <MacGyver> Not that you *need* clicktracking for that, btw.
[05:21:18] <MacGyver> Actually come to think of it, clicktracking is a very bad way of ensuring tokens aren't reused.
[05:21:59] <MacGyver> Regardless, I'm too cynical to believe the clicktracking is benign.
[05:25:18] <noex> no clue. they might just be stupid.
[05:25:55] <noex> they have one of those password restriction things where I can only use certain special characters, so
[05:27:44] <noex> i worked at a place where they suggested you use "a symbol like @, !, etc" for their windows installer. I found out later due to a bug with WIX, using the '@' symbol like the text suggested propagated errors into the registry, database, and application to the point where the accepted solution was to completely reinstall the operating system. no one seemed to see any issues with that.
[05:28:18] <noex> "it's a known issue."  they were shipping that installer to a customer
[05:28:49] <noex> anyway...tldr progressive is probably just dumb imo

[19:50:31] <PolGZ[m]> https://qutebrowser.org/doc/help/settings.html#types
[19:51:06] <PolGZ[m]> Bool
[19:51:06] <PolGZ[m]> A boolean setting, either true or false.
[19:51:06] <PolGZ[m]> When setting from a string, 1, yes, on and true count as true, while 0, no, off and false count as false (case-insensitive).
[19:55:02] <The-Compiler> PolGZ[m]: if you're setting a setting from a config.py, you will need to pass the appropriate Python types, not strings like with the :set command
