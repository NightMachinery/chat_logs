[02:51:13] <FrostyX> I've noticed that ELPA doesn't have any API (at least not advertised one), so to programmatically obtain the list of all packages and their details, one must have to clone its git repo and parse it. The problem is that package-list is a lisp-data document and package information is stored in .el files as comments. Which really sucks to parse in other programming languages. Do you know if the data is available anywhere else in a
[02:51:13] <FrostyX> different format? I don't mind if they are not fully up-to-date

[09:13:44] <codingquark> There should be a `provide' expression at the end of that file
[09:13:52] <codingquark> That's the name of the package
[09:14:05] <Boarders_> Yes, the file ends: (provide 'ats-mode)
[09:14:16] <Boarders_> should it be the same as the file name? (I don't know emacs lisp)
[09:14:34] <codingquark> Okay, so you load the files from the path, and then (require 'ats-mode)
[09:15:04] <Boarders_> why is load-path not working on the directory though for this?
[09:15:35] <codingquark> Can you try without expand-file-name?
[09:16:13] <edrx> Try this: C-h f require
[09:16:16] <Boarders_> That does not work
[09:16:36] <Boarders_> I feel like I maybe don't understand how load-path works
[09:17:15] <edrx> you will see that the first argument to require is FEATURE, and if you don't give it a second argument FILENAME then it will try to build the FILENAME from FEATURE
[09:17:20] <Boarders_> I thought you could have some .el files in a directory and then add that dir to load-path and then you could use (require 'blah) where those .el files have (provide 'blah) but at the moment something about that is not working
[09:17:39] <edrx> by just appending .el or .elc - and then it will search for that filename in the load-path
[09:17:50] <Boarders_> ah ok
[09:18:02] <Boarders_> I'll just rename the files, it is stupid how they are named anyway

[09:45:20] <codingquark> solrize: that's really not how it works. It doesn't track you on arxiv.org
[09:45:48] <solrize> you mean almost all the new posts on arxiv are machine learning?  i guess that doesn't surprise me too much
[09:45:52] <codingquark> You have to rank papers on the arxiv-sanity deployment

[09:47:30] <edrx> but when I manage to write something that the editors of arxiv would approve - something that is clean enough and complete enough, with at most a few "[TODO: write this]"s, I submit to arxiv...
[09:48:30] <edrx> aniketgm: wow, thanks! btw, I am going to give this workshop tomorrow and there's even a chance that no one would appear... http://angg.twu.net/2021-workshop.html
[09:48:44] <aniketgm> codingquark: so is it ranking by visitors ? seems subjective.
[09:49:01] <solrize> arxiv used to make a thing of not tracking visit counts

[11:38:54] <Sketch> (that aren't basically running a linux ssh/shell stack)
[11:40:15] <wasamasa> as soon as you have common tools like autoconf, git or texinfo installed, perl is there
[11:42:13] <winning-luser> if it works, it works. i was just so surprised seeing it
[11:42:28] <Sketch> oh wait, i do have perl installed. the package just isn't named perl.

[14:02:38] <Enfors> I see, yeah that makes sense as a contribution too. But to be honest, I'd prefer to *make* something that goes into the Emacs distribution itself. Probably a bit of an ego thing, but I'd love to know that I've contributed something worthwhile, that's being distributed with Emacs.
[14:03:24] <wasamasa> it's hard to write documentation without thoroughly understanding the thing you're documenting
[14:04:27] <Enfors> Indeed. I was thinking maybe I could write an introduction to IRC to go into the ERC info or something like that.
[14:05:18] <Enfors> Last time I checked (which was probably a year or so ago), ERC didn't have that. But maybe that's not something that's regarded as being needed since you can find introductions to IRC outside of Emacs.

[14:21:49] <Enfors> Hmm. After looking a bit at the Emacs info (C-h i), I can't say I understand the thinking on what to include and what not to. Under the Emacs heading, there are only nine(!) topics listed, none of which are something like "Basics of Emacs". And there's lots of non-Emacs stuff under other headings - under Basics, there's "ed". Ed is NOT something that belongs under Basics. It might BE basic in a sense, it's an extremely specialized piece

[14:23:51] <Enfors> Over all, I think the list of topics presented to users when they invoke info is very confusing to new Emacs users. 90% of the stuff there isn't Emacs-related at all for starters, and there is very little that is. I don't understand this at all. Is there an extra info contents package I should have installed or something?

[14:24:20] <artefact> it will show all the info stuff you have installed on your system

[14:24:54] <Enfors> Yes, it seems so - but without an explanation of that, it's very confusing.
[14:25:39] <Enfors> Having just nine Emacs info pages listed as the first thing you see, makes it seem like there is very little Emacs documentation available which is terribly misleading IMO.

[21:36:04] <treflip> Is it possible load some packages (for example, the most heavy ones) and dump an image of Emacs to run with the packages already loaded instead of loading them them every time? My emacs takes ~20 seconds to load ~110 packages. I did some optimization with use-package, but it's insufficient. Also, it feels, like a config, that consists of ~10 small files loads longer than a single .emacs with ~3k lines.
[21:36:37] <bremner> Possible? yes. Easy? probably not.
[21:36:54] <grym> treflip: the usual solution is emacs --daemon 
[21:37:03] <grym> you incur the launch cost, once 
[21:37:11] <bremner> or not using 110 packages :P

[21:40:16] <grym> edrx: depends on what you tell it to do

[22:25:01] <edgarvincent[m]> (Now I think of it, I think I might have already asked a similar question here before...)
[22:25:02] <thblt> roughly, but that's a bit inaccurate. Symbols are just another native type in lisp, you can pass them around and return them just like you do with strings, numbers or lists.

[23:01:59] <ozzloy> prolog is homoiconic?
[23:02:48] <nickdaly> Is paredit the preferred minor mode for semantically editing elisp or scheme, or are there any other competing minor modes?
[23:03:04] <aidalgol> nickdaly: There's also smartparens.
[23:03:57] <nickdaly> aidalgol: thanks, that's what I was looking for, but it's been years.

[23:06:18] <theothornhill> aidalgol: is smartparens preferrable?
[23:06:36] <technomancy> theothornhill: smartparens works on non-lisps
[23:06:45] <technomancy> that's the only reason I can see to prefer it
[23:06:49] <aidalgol> theothornhill: Depends who you ask.

[23:07:12] <technomancy> smartparens can be configured to do the right thing but its out of the box defaults are much worse than paredit
[23:07:52] <theothornhill> technomancy: ah, right.  Paredit sometimes puts me in an awkward state, though.  Does that also happen with smartparens?  Sometimes I cannot delete spurious parens
[23:08:16] <aidalgol> theothornhill: When that happens, just toggle it off temporarily.
[23:08:22] <technomancy> theothornhill: not sure about that. the main rule with paredit is just to never use C-w and you should be fine
[23:08:25] <theothornhill> Yeah, that's what I do
[23:09:02] <theothornhill> hehe yeah, sometimes I forget and shit hits the fan
[23:09:12] <aidalgol> technomancy: BTW, you might like this mini-documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roBkg-iPrbw
[23:09:21] <technomancy> IMO paredit should shadow the C-w binding and have it run 'ignore
