[00:45:29] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> ggplot2 is very powerful but its API is hard to use
[00:49:29] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> plotly has similar API and the output is interactive and much more pleasant to look at
[00:50:17] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> basically anything in the tidyverse, including ggplot2, works but sucks.
[01:01:07] <FromGitter> <osan:kde.org> colab, jupyter notebooks, plotly... those are all browser based tools. and you also say that rstudio sucks (which is another browser-based tool). do you prefer them to programming in a proper IDE? sorry, I'm trying to be nice but I just can't take your opinion seriously at this point, but whatever works fro you
[01:03:40] <FromGitter> <osan:kde.org> and the whole "API is hard to use" remark, ggplot2 is baby mode. matplotlib can accomplish the same, but with far more configuration and boilerplate required
[01:03:56] <FromGitter> <osan:kde.org> this is just funny to read
[01:20:19] *** Joins: makomo (~makomo@user/makomo)
[01:25:07] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> > do you prefer them to programming in a proper IDE ‚èé  ‚èé No. I prefer to avoid R and python at all cost.
[01:26:06] <FromGitter> <mcp292> I too dislike R, but it's definitely not dying. It's widely used and taught in research.
[01:26:38] <FromGitter> <mcp292> What is your basis for saying this? What language do you program in?
[01:27:04] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> 1) both languages suck. but R sucks more. ‚èé 2) If possible, don't write either of them. ‚èé 3) Otherwise, write it in anything other than Emacs to isolate the negative feelings from my workflow.
[01:27:28] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I have written more than a dozen of languages.
[01:28:14] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> R and Python are right below LaTeX in my most hated language list.
[01:29:11] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Python has a good ecosystem but I don't like the language itself. R has nothing to like, but I can put every statement in parentheses to pretend that I'm writing some lisp dialect.
[01:30:03] <FromGitter> <mcp292> > @lebensterben Thanks. Do you do python data science in spacemacs? ‚èé  ‚èé I use pandas for this
[01:32:17] <FromGitter> <mcp292> Hey, I really avoid R any chance I get and have been using pandas. Can you tell me through your experience why you find ggplot etc more productive?
[01:32:56] <FromGitter> <mcp292> Also what you mean by  ‚èé  ‚èé > I have pretty tight pandas -> R workflow now
[01:33:15] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> ```import numpy as np ‚èé  ‚èé foo = np.array([1, 2, 3]) ‚èé foo[0] = 0.5 ‚èé print(foo)``` ‚èé  ‚èé and you get [0, 2, 3]. This is JavaScript level absurdity. [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=61faffa303f2704782169d49]
[01:35:30] <FromGitter> <mcp292> Dataframe columns have data types and numpy is usually used for datafram/pandas stuff. That's probably guiding the design decision there. At least you won't be surprised by this behavior when you put it in a df
[01:36:13] <FromGitter> <mcp292> What is top of your list for language @lebensterben?
[01:36:55] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Rust

[01:37:53] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> Hard to choose.
[01:38:12] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I write lots of LISP and Shell.
[01:38:40] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> But they definitely are not as good as C
[01:40:33] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> I like reading Java but I don't want to write it. I write Haskell but it's hard to read other people's Haskell.
[01:40:41] <FromGitter> <mcp292> Nice
[01:41:45] <FromGitter> <mcp292> I prefer python to bash, never jumped into lisp. C and python for me in that order, although lately I can't ignore how fast big projects get done when using python.
[01:42:17] <FromGitter> <mcp292> Every try Ada? That's on my list to learn
[01:45:32] <FromGitter> <lebensterben> No. https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/gnat-rust.html
