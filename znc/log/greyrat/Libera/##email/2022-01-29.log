[14:49:44] <bremner> Assid: I used to use fetchmail. Then I switched to getmail, which doesn't need a working local MTA.
[14:50:33] <Assid> suggestions on how to get it setup
[14:51:40] <bremner> which? in both cases you  need to give it your imap credentials; 
[14:55:06] <tuxick> or just forward
[14:56:01] <Assid> need to clear off from gmail .. onto another box..
[14:57:12] *** Joins: bsd4me (~bsduser@user/bsd4me)
[15:08:57] <bremner> Assid: I don't know much about cpanel. If you don't have full shell access, then figuring out what your host can actually do is probably the first step
[15:30:58] <tuxick> Assid: any mail client will move your mail
[15:31:08] <tuxick> maybe except lookout
[15:31:16] <tuxick> but nobody uses that

[15:33:01] <colo> for backing up imap mailboxen to $something (that might as well be imap mailboxen), I've come to appreciate mbsync (aka isync) a lot.
[15:33:16] <Assid> yay.. getmail is much much better :P thanks
[15:33:23] <Assid> now i need to figure out the labels
[15:41:14] <Assid> but i can only do 1 sync at a time
[15:41:36] <Assid> as in 1 folder .. to 1 destination
