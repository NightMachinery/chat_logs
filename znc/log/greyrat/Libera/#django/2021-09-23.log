[00:01:47] <gravyconductor> I think we'd rather not have celery making those decisions and hopefully have brokers have functionality where we wouldn't have to rely on that. For example, SQS has the notion of redrive policies (where it's the responsibility of the queue to know when workers are failing to full process a task and then send it to a DLQ)
[00:02:16] <gravyconductor> So in that scenario we're not relying on celery to manage it

[10:51:48] <pycode> hello, can anyone explain why i should restart my application again and again when i change something in code? with php (php-fpm) no i can change the code an see the results immediately
[10:51:52] <pycode> is there a way to avoid that?
[10:52:10] <pycode> it is a bit boring restart, the app/celery etc
[10:53:44] <dodo> pycode: don't you use the dev server?
[10:54:04] <pycode> locally with runserver after i made something it restarts automatically but on server behind nginx i always  need to restart uvicorn
[10:54:10] <pycode> dodo, yes for local yes
[10:55:42] <dodo> well. the answer is... do not edit deployed code
[10:55:58] <pycode> dodo no i mean after a git pull on server
[10:56:11] <pycode> as i wrote with php i can git pull and immediatelly see the new files
[10:56:27] <pycode> with django no, i git pull and then i need to always restart uvicorn service
[10:56:28] <dodo> git pull on a server has lots of potential problems, i wouldn't do that either
[10:56:31] <pycode> celery service
[10:56:39] <pycode> dodo, what do you do
[10:56:39] <pycode> ?
[10:56:41] <dodo> why does your deployment not simply restart celery?
[10:56:51] <pycode> i mean for deployment what are the steps you follow?
[10:56:58] <dodo> each deploy gets a new virtualenv
[10:57:01] <mbrndtgn> UsmanBanka: What serafeim said. Django might overwhelm you, but don't worry. You might want to have a look at a simpler web framework like Flask or Bottle first.
[10:57:05] <dodo> pycode: and a new source tree
[10:57:50] <pycode> dodo, wait... 1) do you create a new virtualenv    2) "duplicate" the code there   3) install packages  4) restart services ?
[10:57:57] <dodo> pycode: yes
[10:58:27] <pycode> dodo, out of curiosity do you handle those tasks manually?
[10:58:35] <dodo> pycode: no, all automated
[10:59:11] <pycode> dodo, do you use a tool for that?
[10:59:17] <pycode> or just a bash script ?
[10:59:30] <dodo> pycode: i have a shell script that does this, yes. and i also use saltstack to do the same
[11:00:17] *** Quits: zappedfish (~JustAGues@81.222.188.44) (Quit: Client closed)
[11:00:53] <pycode> dodo,  i see a problem here..i mean ok, the process makes sense, of course but...but what if you are running a database? i mean...ok you "duplicate" the code that way...new virtualenv ok...but if the database is the same you have to run the migration on the same db backend so the problems could happen here too
[11:00:59] <pycode> no?
[11:01:13] <dodo> the problem?
[11:01:35] <dodo> pycode: right, for migrations you have to take care not to e.g. remove fields that the old code still uses
[11:01:45] <dodo> this is a problem with every deployment method though
[11:02:13] <dodo> which is solved by 1. deploy new fields and code, 2. remove unused fields in second deployment
[11:02:17] <dodo> requires minimal planning
[11:02:24] <pycode> dodo, so basically you have ver 2 of the project run everything and then remove the previous virtualenv right?
[11:02:43] <dodo> pycode: i actually keep the previous around, for potential rollbacks
[11:02:50] <dodo> but older ones are removed, yeah
[11:03:07] <dodo> and we i prefer to fail forward too, haven't done a rollback in years ;)
[11:03:41] <pycode> ok
[11:04:37] <pycode> i heard that people use docker for deploy, they basically copy do a snapshot of the database and then run the code of that version...if everything is ok the drop the previous docker
[11:04:41] <pycode> idk
[11:09:20] <pycode> dodo, i do not know if docker could impact performances of the website, i mean running a website inside a docker container.. could be a solution too ?
[11:11:32] <dodo> waaat
[11:11:47] <dodo> even with docker, you probably don't want your database in docker
[11:12:09] <pycode> dodo maybe postgresql in another docker container?
[11:12:16] <dodo> and copying the database sounds like it would lead to lots of problems
[11:12:28] <pycode> never used it...just trying to understand what is the "best" way to deploy and isolate the code
[11:12:29] <dodo> pycode: i wouldn't put it in a container at all
[11:12:44] <dodo> app workers, sure, why not
[11:13:14] <dodo> you could definitely isolate python code with containers, yeah
[11:13:26] <dodo> then you can prebuild the images and deploy them, could be faster
[11:20:01] <pycode> dodo, i never used docker but if it is a kind of "virtualization" system does it not slow down the website (a bit) ?
[11:20:04] <pycode> just for curiosity
[11:20:14] <pycode> i am not running a website like instagram.com ahah
[11:21:09] <dodo> pycode: docker is not virtualization, it just isolates processes using kernel namespaces
[11:21:35] <dodo> the performance impact is negligible, if there even is any
[11:25:35] <pycode> dodo, so basically i can create the container locally and then upload it on server
[11:25:39] <pycode> and...that's it
[11:25:41] <pycode> right?
[11:26:01] <dodo> you can, yes
[11:28:30] <pycode> dodo, so basically i could do...   1. upload docker   2. backup database  3. run docker with db to apply migrations
[11:28:47] <pycode> i suppose i can access postgres from a docker container right? or postgresql should run inside docker?
[11:30:45] <dodo> i'd recommend to start playing with docker in a dev env ;)
[11:30:59] <pycode> ahah sure ahah
[11:30:59] <dodo> for dev i have pg in docker
[11:32:05] <pycode> dodo, why not on server also?

[17:36:36] <GinFuyou> bodozene, what your look for called "context processor"
[17:36:54] <pycode> i have pyenv and i have installed python 3.9.7
[17:37:04] <pycode> could be good with the last stable?
[17:40:08] <T-101> I'm feeling brave so going with 3.10.rc2
[17:40:18] <T-101> that match/case is just so sweet
[17:40:22] <pycode> ahahah
[17:40:33] <pycode> T-101, yes that's the main reason
[17:40:44] <T-101> zero problems so far
[17:40:51] <T-101> two django projects using that
[17:41:01] <pycode> T-101, but the last stable version of django is 3.2
[17:41:09] <pycode> 4.0 is not stable yet
[17:41:13] <pycode> so i will use django 3.2
[17:41:31] <pycode> with 3.9 i am not so brave...
[17:41:32] <pycode> :D
[17:42:03] <pycode> but yes match/Case are going to convince me :D

I want to make a page to create a new song for a given artist: the artist pk is in the URL, and I want to create a song for this artist. I am using CreateView to have a lot of things made automatically, however the "select"
[22:23:43] <TWal> form to choose the album is messed up: it displays every album from every artist, where I only want it to show the albums of the artist given in the URL. Do you know what is the best way to do this? I searched on the internet how to customize a ModelForm like this, without success. If some of you have any idea, it would be amazing!
[22:24:12] <TWal> (The only solution I thought of would be to avoid using ModelForm and write my form from scratch, but it doesn't seem like a beautiful solution)
