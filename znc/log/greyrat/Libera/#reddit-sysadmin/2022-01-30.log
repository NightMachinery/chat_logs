[00:59:50] <monr0e> It might be worth engineering something up. Perhaps something that clips onto the breast pocket, and will send an alarm if it is in a horizontal position for more than, say, two minutes. You could go a little further and add a panic button to it. Perhaps something that connects to a fitbit or a smartwatch and can monitor things like blood pressure (which would drop substantially in the case of a head wound) and pulse.
[01:00:58] <Hunterkll> apple watch can do this (fall detection)
[01:01:03] <Hunterkll> so can life alert, i think :P
[01:01:20] <JollyRgrs> life alert would be a better option, imo
[01:01:46] <Hunterkll> yea apple watch would only be a good idea because no reocurring service fees and only if said person already have an iphone

[01:13:13] <Hunterkll> bahahahhahahah
[01:21:00] <monr0e> I saw their video on it earlier. To be frank, I'm surprised Anthony isn't taking on the lead role. Jake is very clearly inexperienced, although it has to be said that he has calmed down a great deal since he first started appearing on the channel - and he seems to be learning a lot. Realistically though, if this was Linus' project, its on him for not delegating or designating responsibility for data integrity to someone. 
[01:21:35] <Hunterkll> more to the point - this is par for the course and what i expect from a shop full of (mostly) incompetents and 1 guy who knows what he's talking about in a specific field
[01:21:46] <Hunterkll> and why i tell people not to listen to a damn thing that channel says
[01:21:47] <Hunterkll> lol
[01:21:58] <monr0e> Incidentally, are cold storage backup solutions not a thing anymore? Even the local authority I worked for ten years ago had a tape backup solution
[01:22:01] <Hunterkll> lol @ not updating shit at ever 
[01:22:06] <Hunterkll> absolutely
[01:22:17] <Hunterkll> best way to not get permanantly fuckered by crypto
[01:22:30] <Hunterkll> either online disks that get dismounted or what have you
[01:22:39] <Hunterkll> we've got a few 200 tape libraries in our datacenters 
[01:22:50] <Hunterkll> among other methods, including cloud based systems that are isolated, etc 
[01:22:58] <Hunterkll> racks of EMC datadomains acting as VTLs too 
[01:23:07] <monr0e> Eh, they're pretty good for consumer grade stuff. That's pretty much what LTT is, an enthusiast show. Anyone who listens to them for solid enterprise advice is a fucking tool
[01:23:07] <Hunterkll> VNX out the ass 
[01:23:09] <Hunterkll> tons of shit 
[01:23:14] <Hunterkll> monr0e: but the're horrible
[01:23:15] <Hunterkll> like
[01:23:25] <Hunterkll> outright false/misleading shit in every video that'll get someone fucking up their home shit
[01:23:34] <Hunterkll> or build something that doesn't work the way they think it should
[01:23:39] <Hunterkll> because of errors/omissions/etc
[01:23:58] <Hunterkll> and then like 6mos later they'll put out a video "oh yea we forgot to tell you our system had $$$ part in it too! thanks for the comments!"
[01:24:41] <Hunterkll> they're not verge pc building level (actually, that video linus did with the verge guy was probably the only REALLY good content outside of anthony talking i've ever seen come out of his shop)
[01:24:56] <Hunterkll> but they're not exactly a whole level above either 
[01:24:57] <monr0e> Maybe. I'm generally more into the showcasing stuff. The modular laptop was a wicked idea and I'd never have heard about it otherwise. At least not until much later
[01:25:21] <Azem> Hunterkll: anthony talking is only good thing that came out of that shop, I cringed so hard at that server video 
[01:25:37] <Hunterkll> that's an idea that's been around for a long damn time with lots of variations/development....
[01:25:40] <monr0e> I still cringe at their entire server "cupboard"
[01:25:42] <Hunterkll> I remember some 486 demo units 
[01:25:49] <Hunterkll> for modular laptop building/upgrading 
[01:26:18] <Hunterkll> there's a reason it hasn't really caught on, for the same reason I pay more for less with thinner/lighter/unrepairable(to most people) units
[01:26:43] *** Azem is now known as haise01
[01:26:45] <Hunterkll> just like how MXM graphics cards never really caught on either 
[01:27:14] <Hunterkll> whereas the framework laptop is just too damn much money for what you get even so, because they trided to do the thin/light/repairable all at once 
[01:27:16] *** haise01 is now known as Emet-Selch
[01:27:27] *** Parts: Emet-Selch (~haise01@user/haise01) (Leaving)
[01:28:21] <Hunterkll> like the framework $2k config, i might as well just buy a surface book and have better battery life, GPU, functionality, etc.... for the same/near-same damn price 
[01:28:49] <monr0e> Eh, framework is a bit hit&miss. Its the idea that I love, but I would have taken a bit of a different approach. I couldn't tell you *what* approach off the top of my head, but as it stands it does make a good start
[01:29:11] <Hunterkll> it's just a new iteration of an old idea 
[01:29:14] <Hunterkll> just like VR is

[01:30:22] <Hunterkll> VR games in arcades were the rage too them 
[01:30:26] <Hunterkll> then
[01:30:52] <monr0e> vyz: yeah, sure, those are nice. I had the 745 g2 at work. Top of the spec line too
[01:31:10] <Hunterkll> Got an 840 G2 here, need to figure out why it doesn't power on, did last time I used it before i tried again 
[01:31:12] <monr0e> I *really* liked the... was it 12 cores?

[01:32:27] <Hunterkll> monr0e: the only really promising evolution of tech - but still rehashing on older designs - was the google Project Ara

[01:32:42] <Hunterkll> lol
[01:32:47] <monr0e> o yeah I remember that
[01:33:01] <monr0e> nice theory. I would never buy one though
[01:33:12] <monr0e> Not when the likes of the LG G3 existed
[01:33:15] <Hunterkll> I was working on a ham radio transceiver design for it 
[01:33:23] <monr0e> That phone was awesome, and not that hard to fix
[01:33:48] <Hunterkll> someone else i was working with made a DTV tuner for it lol 
[01:34:00] <Hunterkll> phone would hvae had more antennas than a porcupine if we had made our modules 
[01:34:47] <Hunterkll> I met the guy who's dog was on the back of one of the modules they had and got to handle one of the four prototypes that were made in the world @_@ 
[01:35:15] <Hunterkll> monr0e: yea, repairability isn't what I cared about for ara 
[01:35:18] <monr0e> They actually made prototypes?
[01:35:22] <Hunterkll> changable functionality was
[01:35:39] <Hunterkll> yes, the one i had didn't have functional touchscreen drivers yet, but it booted and ran android/got signal 
[01:36:00] <monr0e> mmhmm, the LG G3 could do that too, it had some contacts on the back that could support external devices, like one of them old moto handsets
[01:36:07] *** Quits: Solatia (~chicken@user/chicken) (Quit: Rest in Power)
[01:36:12] <Hunterkll> sure, USB can do that too
[01:36:20] <Hunterkll> not quite the same as having access to the internal highspeed bus 
[01:36:39] <monr0e> That's essentially what it was, a custom USB... thingy
[01:36:43] <Hunterkll> LG G3 couldn't, for example, dump raw I/Q for radio analysis software running on the CPU to access - nowhere near enough bandwidth on the pogo pins 
[01:36:52] <monr0e> oh fuck no
[01:37:19] <Hunterkll> or say, do high speed data, high resolution photos, hook up gigabit ethernet to dump pictures from my camera directly, do real time shooting/recording, etc
[01:37:48] <monr0e> Nope. Although tbf I wouldn't do that on a phone anyway
[01:37:54] <monr0e> some might
[01:37:55] <monr0e> idk
[01:38:13] <Hunterkll> i mean, if i could use it to control my DSLR with all the features you need a laptop for, that'd be amazing : P
[01:38:19] <Hunterkll> but yea, see, the thi ng is, possibilities 
[01:38:31] <Hunterkll> the ara platform with it's spiral spine design was amazing 
[01:38:33] <Hunterkll> but yea - https://www.dezeen.com/2015/01/15/google-project-ara-modular-smartphone-spiral-2-prototype/
[01:38:39] <Hunterkll> the red one was the prototype i handled
[01:39:11] <monr0e> Wasn;t there a sony camera built on android? I seem to remember one. And a camera from before the Android era with a full touchscreen on the back too, also a sony
[01:39:30] <Hunterkll> probably
[01:39:39] <monr0e> Is that the same dog?
[01:39:39] <Hunterkll> i'm not sure, i don't really pay attention to consumer cameras
[01:39:41] <Hunterkll> yes
[01:39:50] <Hunterkll> that's the dog i was referencing lol
[01:41:26] <monr0e> Oh btw, on those elitebooks, if they don't boot, pull out the battery and AC and hodl power for fifteen seconds. Worth a shot
[01:41:33] <Hunterkll> did that 
[01:41:37] <Hunterkll> pulled the cmos battery too even 
[01:41:43] <monr0e> noooo dont do that!
[01:41:45] <Hunterkll> just need to dive in because it's probably something stupid 
[01:41:57] <Hunterkll> monr0e: was a common fix for a specific issue when i was supporting a fleet of them
[01:42:08] <Hunterkll> the image that's on the machine was deployed from my SCCM in 2016 :P
[01:42:16] <Hunterkll> (at that contract site, that is)
[01:43:21] <Hunterkll> monr0e: but you want prior art for modular phones, microsoft had a patent in 2011 for a modular phone design :P
[01:44:27] <monr0e> Oh man, we had *so* many issues with that. At HP you're your own technician, so the most you get is some poor sap in the phillipines to maybe help you out. They kept asking users to try reseating the cmos battery, and inevitably the laptop would stop doing anything except for flashing the power button whenever it was pressed. Had to reset them with the no-power/hodl-power thing
[01:44:56] <monr0e> I have no doubt that a ridiculous number of machines were replaced needlessly
[01:45:12] <Hunterkll> heh
[01:45:39] <Hunterkll> yea i never actually looked deep into it
[01:45:47] <Hunterkll> just did some basic shit like that and was like eh another time
[01:45:48] <monr0e> Oh, and nobody ever gets a used machine when they start. You get a brand new, in box, laptop. You get a USB key for imaging it with. You get a brand new monitor, KB, mouse
[01:46:23] <monr0e> I actually got three sets of monitors and peripherals, because apparently the two departments I moved to thoguht I was a new hrie
[01:46:51] <monr0e> so I set up a little command centre for myself and I was very happy indeed
[01:47:17] <monr0e> I somehow ended up with two of the separate secure machines for accessing the linux stuff too
[01:48:38] <Hunterkll> heh, i've got five work machines right now, but that's out of necessity
[01:49:49] <Hunterkll> I just bought an IPKVM and use my personal desktop with them all in a stack
[01:50:26] <monr0e> we had some awful mini KVMs there. Whenever you switched back to windows, there was a three second delay before you could type anything

[03:16:05] <Hunterkll> @Mitchy93 that's not always nearly as good as people think it is

[03:19:18] <Hunterkll> but seagate drives are well within industry standard failure rates and have been for ages

[03:27:33] <Hunterkll> actually bought it explicitly to ditch the usb hub thingy i was using and set up a DC++ server at dreamhack anaheim 2020

[03:28:50] <Hunterkll> what else are you gonna use to set up a massive file dump?
[03:29:25] <Kiernian> hadn't considered it. Never come up. Genius, though.
[03:29:25] <Hunterkll> but yea, for drive failures of drives in the range of sane statistical data (over 250,000 drive days per model), the AFR for HGST and Seagate were really similar 
[03:29:59] <Hunterkll> apparently the 6TB seagate drive had the *lowest* AFR 
[03:30:08] <LXGHTNXNG> Hewo
[03:30:14] <Hunterkll> while also being the oldest in the fleet
[03:30:41] <Hunterkll> the 18TB had the highest AFR of 12.54% with two failures and 5,820 drive days :P lmao

[07:48:22] <Hunterkll> a /64 is what you should use, like you'd use a /24 on a regular IPv4 vlan 
[07:49:02] <mistiry> Which is why the oper scripts that they use defaults to /64 for an IPv6 ban, which is also what the Matrix.org bridge connects to Libera with.
[07:49:16] <mistiry> so when they tried to kline someone, it did the whole /64 that belongs to the matrix.org bridge
