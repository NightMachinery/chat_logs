[16:15:00] <_moep_> hey there! Im trying to build a grok expression: https://bpa.st/QZ3A but now I have the problem, that it doesnt match the full expression. whats mission?
[16:17:39] <beorn__> _moep_: Start with a small part of the grok and make sure each part works as expected.
[16:18:08] <_moep_> I did, thats how I started with grok
[16:18:22] <beorn__> Then apply that experience here as well.
[16:18:47] <_moep_> but thats the only filter where I have a problem
[16:19:11] <beorn__> I can understand that you have problems, yes.
[16:19:42] <beorn__> For example, why do you have two question marks several places?
[16:20:49] <beorn__> Are all your EXIM_* patterns defined?
[16:21:14] <_moep_> because I want to keep sure, that space + entry is part of the match and I dont know if EXIM_MSG_SIZE and exim_dkim_value in the line
[16:21:20] <_moep_> yes, 
[16:21:31] <_moep_> https://grokconstructor.appspot.com/groklib/exim
[16:21:35] <beorn__> If you are in doubt, check every single part, one by one.
[16:22:59] *** Joins: BSaboia (~bsaboia@177.37.198.83)
[16:24:31] <_moep_> well the constructor shows only exim_dkim_value and remote_heloname which are not included into the log line
[16:24:52] <beorn__> https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/ <- test it here
[16:24:55] <_moep_> so they are empy. everything else match and works fine
[16:25:33] <_moep_> I did that here https://grokconstructor.appspot.com/do/match#
[16:25:36] <_moep_> I did that here https://grokconstructor.appspot.com/do/match
[16:26:25] *** Quits: BSaboia (~bsaboia@177.37.198.83) (Client Quit)
[16:27:16] <beorn__> https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/ seems to parse your log line just fine.
[16:28:02] <_moep_> I get NOT MATCHED. The longest regex prefix matching the beginning of this line is as follows:
[16:29:07] *** Joins: BSaboia (~bsaboia@177.37.198.83)
[16:29:48] <_moep_> but the "longest regex prefix" is basicly my full pattern7
[16:30:15] <beorn__> I have no idea what you mean by that
[16:31:46] <_moep_> beorn__: in my paste the full line 5
[16:31:58] <beorn__> Your log line and grok pattern works fine for me in https://grokconstructor.appspot.com/do/match too.
[16:32:25] <beorn__> _moep_: What do you mean by "longest regex prefix" ?
[16:32:45] <_moep_> wait
[16:34:18] <_moep_> beorn__: https://imgur.com/a/uD0dPzR
[16:35:02] <beorn__> Works for me
[16:36:30] <_moep_> beorn__: and when you test it, its green on the testwebsite? or works for me like no 100% match but I get the nessecary stuff?
[16:40:11] <_moep_> Im asking, because I have for this line a grokparsefailure
[16:42:09] <beorn__> Your logline and grok pattern works for me in both https://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/ and https://grokconstructor.appspot.com/do/match
[16:42:30] <beorn__> Obviously it has no values for remote_heloname or exim_dkim_value because they are not in the logline.
[16:44:03] <_moep_> when you test at the website e.g. just with EXIM_DATE you get a "MATCHED"
[16:44:25] <beorn__> Yes. It says "MATCHED", in green, here.
[16:45:12] <_moep_> and I want see the same for my full grok filter (the in my paste line 5)
[16:45:28] <beorn__> That is what I used.
[16:46:01] <beorn__> (Except that you have tried to change the hostname and IP address in your pastebin but not in the imgur image.
[16:47:03] <beorn__> My best guess is that where you have "?? " you should have "? ?"
[16:49:59] <_moep_> hm strange

[17:44:33] <valentin> hey guys. How do I get from kibana what logfiles are being logged?  Is that a thing?
[17:56:32] <beorn__> That depends 100% on your setup.
[17:58:26] <valentin> beorn__: ideally I'd want something to call using `curl .... localhost:9200/_....`
[17:58:35] <valentin> to use the API basically
[17:59:53] <beorn__> You can use curl to use the API
[18:49:16] <valentin> beorn__: yes I see. 
[18:50:51] <valentin> beorn__: I was thinking how to write a query that counts how many times a pattern appears in how many files
[18:51:16] <valentin> so for example. /var/log/ceph/ceph_1111.log   444
[18:51:39] <valentin> which means that /var/log/ceph/ceph_1111.log pattern appeared in 444 files
