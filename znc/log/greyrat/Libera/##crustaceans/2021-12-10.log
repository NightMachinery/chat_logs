[17:07:26] <Brekkjern> I don't understand the circlejerking in programming circles about him
[17:14:38] <gwozniak> There's a point in that "Collapse" talk but it's not a "sobering watch"
[17:14:46] <ngoldbaum> but Brekkjern we are in the greek dark ages of programming
[17:15:02] <ngoldbaum> the pythonic oral tradition
[17:19:23] <gwozniak> Based on what I have been dealing with for the past week, if we made programmers work at the low level, that would be a serious regression
[17:22:34] <gwozniak> Headline in the news: ``Tesla‚Äôs Musk says he is ‚Äòthinking of‚Äô quitting his jobs''
[17:22:43] <gwozniak> Why do we pay attention to this fuckwit...
[17:43:46] <river> to be fair jblow is right about some stuff wrt. programming, like how it sucks and people are bad at it
[17:45:42] <gwozniak> But that is not anything noteworthy to point out
[17:46:08] <river> I think it's a very important thing, like we shouldn't just get used to it and accept it
[17:48:57] <river> thing I don't understand is how involving yourself with the likes of urbit will help
[17:49:30] <gwozniak> The thing is, we'll probably always muddle our way through it
[17:49:57] <gwozniak> If we want to be better at it, we need to stop valuing the Silicon Valley way to approaching development, not "get back to basics"

[18:54:16] <manicennui> dimadima: You just realized this?
[18:55:21] <manicennui> So I learned that the auth issues I was bitching about are ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù of JWT.
[18:55:56] <manicennui> More fucking garbage that frontend devs invented
[18:57:24] <manicennui> But even JWT blowhards don‚Äôt recommend using it if you are running a banking website or something.
[18:57:33] <manicennui> We are a damn lender.
[18:59:05] <manicennui> The only reason I was even looking into our auth is because we want to log some users out when we detect fraud
[18:59:45] <indigo> Ahh JWT‚Ä¶ more complicated than necessary in most cases
[19:06:08] <indigo> Whatever happened with regular old session tokens
[19:06:26] <gwozniak> I am working on code now that it littered with #ifdefs that block out sections of functions, and I'm certain that 2/3 of those #ifdefs can just be deleted.  But I can't change it...
[19:07:42] <gwozniak> The #ifdef pattern to remove code inside a function is such a massive anti-pattern
[19:16:33] <indigo> Gross
[19:16:51] <indigo> Hard to test, too
[19:17:17] <indigo> Is this GCC or what
[19:17:30] <gwozniak> It's one of our (annoying) additions
[19:17:59] <gwozniak> It's the license stuff that was added to appease the biz folks
[19:18:36] <gwozniak> Remarkably old stuff, I think
[19:18:43] <manicennui> At about 4 AM I heard a series of 6 to 7 gunshots. That was nice.

[19:19:55] <indigo> Actually you live in Chicago, nvm
[19:20:16] <manicennui> It was very obvious.
[19:20:26] <manicennui> I have questioned them in the past, but this was definitely gunshots.
[19:20:52] <manicennui> Sounded like it was maybe 2-3 blocks away.
[19:21:12] <manicennui> Not very common in my neighborhood.
[19:24:00] <river> yes it is

[20:46:54] <gwozniak> LAWL
[20:47:03] <gwozniak> wow... way to miss the point
[20:47:06] <Brekkjern> Yep
[20:47:23] <Brekkjern> There are arguably only two other characters that would have been worse choices...
[20:47:30] <Brekkjern> Vi and Silco
[20:47:55] <Brekkjern> How did you like the show btw?
[20:48:43] <Brekkjern> I guess "find the show" is a better expression there?
[20:48:46] <gwozniak> Thought it was great.  Things I didn't like: the opening music and some music choices here and there, and the facial animation always seemed off, but I got past it after a while
[20:49:40] <gwozniak> I found some dialogue/character sequences a bit clunky, as in "let's just get past this using a trope", but overall it was really, really good
[20:50:14] <gwozniak> The way the story shifts is very well done, and really makes the whole story much more interesting
[20:50:20] <Brekkjern> Most of the trope usage is probably because they have to stick to the source material in some form
[20:50:41] <gwozniak> It did feel very "video game-y" at times
[20:50:49] <Brekkjern> Yeah. Some of the fights especially
[20:51:52] <gwozniak> I really didn't care for the opening music, but that is not a reason to not watch.  It was a really good show.  The animation, overall, was stellar
[20:52:04] <gwozniak> Absolutely gorgeous to look at
[20:52:44] <Brekkjern> I agree on the opening theme. I think it's really chosen because of Imagine Dragon's reputation in the League community
[20:52:59] <Brekkjern> There would probably be way better choices for it
[20:53:20] <Brekkjern> It grew on me somewhat though
[20:53:38] <gwozniak> I mean, it's kind of stuck in my head, but that doesn't make it a good song ;)
[20:53:48] <Brekkjern> Yeah
[20:53:59] <Brekkjern> But that's ID for you...
[20:54:12] <gwozniak> Also, the voice acting was good, too.  Vi got really good as the show progressed
[20:55:05] <Brekkjern> Yeah. The part where they are young is also acted rather well. I don't think I've seen children represented as well as that on screen before
[20:56:30] <gwozniak> I will say the very end was a bit disappointing, but not because of the content.  The setup for what comes next was a bit... abrupt.
[20:57:04] <gwozniak> I guess I wanted a little more resolution than what they gave.  I won't say anything though, to prevent spoilers
[20:57:48] <Brekkjern> Mhm. It was a bit jarring to me too, but I don't feel like the season promises anything other than a "resolution" to Vi and Powder to put it like that.
[20:59:39] <gwozniak> I didn't feel they really resolved that enough for my liking.  But I do believe/understand the actions taken by the characters.  It's just... gimme a short coda or something :)
[20:59:57] <Brekkjern> Hah
[21:01:28] <Brekkjern> Well, I think it ended at an appropriate spot if the goal was to tell the story of how Powder becomes Jinx, but I do understand the desire for more of the story threads to be tied up neatly
[21:02:30] <Brekkjern> But that said, I think many of those threads would be resolved better in a new season where they could be appropriately focused on instead of having to share space with the Vi/Powder storyline
[21:42:21] <imode> oh my god I just saw the actual content of the log4j RCE stuff.
[21:42:34] <imode> how in the world is that a sane default.
