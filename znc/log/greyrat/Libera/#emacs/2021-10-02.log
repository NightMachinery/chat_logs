[01:16:35] <jan1> Hello everyone! I want to start using Emacs mainly for Org-mode and for programming in the future. I'm honestly finding it very difficult to kickstart my learning process, there is an overwhelming amount of info out there. what is the bare minimum I need to know to start using org-mode for now? plus do you recommend vanilla emacs for a beginner or something like spacemacs?   
[01:17:37] <cvandusen> ,bootcamp 
[01:17:39] <fsbot`> cvandusen, bootcamp is [0/10] learning Emacs the hard way -- correctly
[01:17:39] <fsbot`> [1] bringing your own or using other people's .emacs is forbidden
[01:17:39] <fsbot`> [2] only 1 hour of .emacs play is allowed at the end of the day
[01:17:39] <fsbot`> [3] forced use of the keyboard ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
[01:18:00] *** Joins: jearl (~user@2620:12b:d000:400::8bb)
[01:18:17] <cvandusen> jan1: Also, C-h t for the tutorial. 
[01:18:42] <bpalmer> jan1: the bare minimum to use org mode is C-x C-f file.org RET and start creating outlines with * for headers, ** for subheaders, etc. But I recommend going through something like orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/orgtutorial_dto.org for a *slightly* more comprehensive intro
[01:18:56] <bpalmer> it gets into some of the things people use org for other than just as a fancier outline-mode
[01:18:59] *** Quits: parsnip (~parsnip@user/parsnip) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[01:19:28] <jan1> cvandusen: I found the tutorial to be confusing 
[01:19:28] <technomancy> jan1: if you know anyone IRL who can help you learn emacs then you should 100% use what they use
[01:20:30] <jan1> Unfortunately I'm not familiar with anyone using Emacs (nor Vim) 
[01:21:06] <technomancy> jan1: in that case you'll get better help from this channel if you avoid spacemacs/doom/whatever
[01:21:32] <jan1> bpalmer: will make sure to read the tutorial on the org website. thanks!

[01:22:07] <jan1> any reasons to avoid spacemancs or doom? 
[01:22:11] <bpalmer> spacemacs, doom, etc add all sorts of fancy ornamentation and configuration; but when something goes wrong, those rococo elements can get in the way
[01:22:31] *** Parts: vxwarlock (~Darkcodex@user/vxwarlock) (Closing Window)
[01:22:52] <bpalmer> Also, I believe both of those are configured by default to use evil; if you're not already a vi user, that's yet one more thing you have to deal with
[01:23:08] <bpalmer> (vi, vim , nvi, etc; I'm lumping them all together)
[01:23:38] <jan1> I used vim for a little bit and I liked its keybindings sytle
[01:23:52] <jan1> will be looking to incorporate evil mode in the future honestly 
[01:24:06] <jan1> but that's for later, will start one step at a time 
[01:24:32] <bpalmer> ... I honestly don't know why people love that style so. I use vi and vim, it's fine, but I've rarely been tempted to bring that to other programs.

[01:25:35] <tyson2> I printed and read through the org-mode manual and found that to be helpful.  I marked it up and still refer to it
[01:25:56] <tyson2> I also printed out the emacs tutorial
[01:26:12] <jan1> good idea, maybe I will do the same 
[01:26:28] <tyson2> I use the original keybindings (have been using emacs for over 20 years one way or the other)
[01:26:33] <technomancy> bpalmer: I don't use vim but I can understand it. it's really stupid to have different functions for move-forward-char/paragraph/word etc instead of one function for moving and an argument for moving by what
[01:26:38] <bpalmer> the org mode manual is nice, but I think the specific guided tutorials are a better way to show org functionality, because org is something different to so so many different groups
[01:27:01] <technomancy> like ... the whole point of emacs is that it's lisp; commands are just function calls, and functions should like ... take arguments? that's kind of a big part of their whole thing.
[01:27:02] <bpalmer> some people care most about the todo and agendas; some people care most about babel and literate programming; others just want a markdown replacement; etc
[01:27:35] <tyson2> I also worked through a number of tutorials.  Knowing Sacha Chua personally was also helpful, she set up my orginal init file for me me
[01:27:41] <technomancy> emacs is just wrong about this. but it's right about a bunch of other things so it balances out in the end.

[01:29:30] <rudybot_> technomancy: I must bring balance to the force.
[01:29:41] <technomancy> it would be bad if emacs were perfect at everything, because it would mean that today's elispers would have nothing left to do
[01:29:44] <bpalmer> I can always write a program that does what I want, but I want my keybindings to be super-efficient: C-f a few times to get where I want to be, M-f when I need to move faster, so I just look and am at the right spot
[01:29:54] <technomancy> like how Alexander the Great wept when he was a kid because he thought there was nothing left to conquer
[01:30:52] <tyson2> sachac: I still have remnants of that original init file, it was very helpful
[01:31:00] <Catie> I remember when I first switched to Emacs I was hopelessly lost and slow at doing anything. I had to take about five seconds every time I needed to use a new command. Over time, it just sort of became muscle memory
[01:31:39] <tyson2> personally I don't like changing any of the standard keybindings.  I add new ones prefaced by C-c if it makes sense
[01:31:43] <Catie> I recommend practicing switching between keybindings to get your fingers used to all the different shapes they have to make
[01:31:52] <bpalmer> at any rate. I've butchered many a document in vi because I happened to be in the wrong mode when I started typing, so that's left a mark.
[01:32:02] <Catie> So like do C-n C-n C-p C-p C-n C-n C-p C-p ...
[01:32:26] <tyson2> before using gnu emacs, I used something called not-gnu emacs on windows, it worked well enough but wasn't programmable
[01:32:55] <Catie> Yeah, I used GNU nano, which is _almost_ emacs-like
[01:33:14] <sachac> I don't have a lot of muscle memory for Emacs these days because I don't have a lot of computer time, so I tend to rely on completion, cheat sheets, and making functions that are named the way I might try to remember them

[04:06:31] <krux02> rudybot, when objects are immutable, it doesn't matter if you have a copy, or a reference to the same object.
[04:06:52] <rudybot> krux02: however, for immutable objects, it wouldn't make any difference if we kept the object itself instead of the reference, and if we copied it, since we couldn't mutate them, we wouldn't see anything.
[04:08:37] <krux02> I realized when programming in scala that the question if something is a copy/reference is pretty much pointless when everything is immutable.
[04:10:44] <krux02> everything is immutale doga allows the implementation to decide on its own if something should be a copy or a reference.

[10:42:02] <lisp123> lampilelo: Yes, that's what I was after. Thanks!

[11:56:36] <parsnip> you got me there

[11:59:09] <twb> parsnip: a TLS library can do it, and you will have access to a TLS library, so you should use the existing tools that are (hopefully) already kept secure and up-to-date by sensible people
[11:59:43] <twb> Doing cert validation yourself is literally the most dangerous thing you can do
[11:59:45] <parsnip> hmm, tls sounds vaguely familiar, but i somehow doubt Dart people got around to making the bit i need available

[12:00:45] <parsnip> for example, when this expired CA fails to validate server cert, it gives no useful feedback
[12:00:58] <parsnip> it will just toggle on an error argument, and share the "bad cert"

[12:14:48] <twb> if you really insist then you'll need to base64 -d the .PEM into a binary-encoded X.509 in some kind of DER I guess
[12:14:49] <parsnip> i realize there's a lot i don't know
[12:15:07] <twb> And then you'll need to somehow load the X.509 ASN.1 schema so it knows what the fuck those bits mean
[12:15:09] <parsnip> does the DER make the metadata apparent?
[12:15:26] <parsnip> that sounds familiar
[12:16:06] <twb>   • .pem – (Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail) Base64 encoded DER certificate, enclosed between "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----"

[12:16:15] <twb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509
[12:16:17] <twb> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1
[12:16:30] <twb> ASN.1 is like XML only it's all binary and horrible
[12:16:49] <twb> X.509 is a schema that says shit like "the next 16 bytes will be a subject name" or whatever
[12:17:37] <twb> DER is a particular way of writing data into bytes...  AIUI DER is to ASN.1 what UTF-8 is to Unicode
[12:19:19] <twb> So what you're talking about here, to not use TLS libraries, is to first write a base64 decoder (not hard), then to write a DER decoder, an ASN.1 parser, find the X.509 ASN.1 schema, load that into the parser, then use the parsed X.509 schema to parse the base64-decoded, DER-decoded certificate
[12:19:51] <parsnip> i think dart provides the base64 decoder
[12:20:01] <parsnip> we used that for fingerprint

[12:39:32] <twb> The main reason dickheads prefer openssl is because it has an "exploit me" license where gnutls cannot be used by evil software
