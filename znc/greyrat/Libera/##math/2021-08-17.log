[00:06:35] <cherim> And Kolmogorov immediately offered a counterexample after the lecture

[06:28:59] <int-e> I mean you can stick to the comparison test. Though I guess you'll be using the sin(x)/x limit either way, so it makes no big difference.

[09:48:11] <Fangs> anyone here understands squareroots and logs?
[09:48:41] <Fleck> ;D
[09:49:12] <Fangs> consider the function z \mapsto z^2. if you take a square with vertices 0, 1, 1+i, i, then you get a 'square' with vertices 0, 1, 2i, -1

[09:50:12] <Fangs> now usually you talk about this "principal branch" of the complex logarithm. on C\(-oo,0] we define Log(z) = \integral_c 1/z dz where c is some contour going from 1 to z
[09:50:24] *** Joins: pavlushka (~pavlushka@user/pavlushka)
[09:51:30] <Fangs> basically you're just saying you are writting z as some function of (r,theta), r > 0 and theta is in (0,2pi)
[09:52:11] <Fangs> so Log(z) is just log(r)* + i theta in this case
[09:52:59] <Fangs> if you take a disc with the non-positive real part removed, and you throw it under this function f(z) = exp(1/2 Log(z)) you get a disc on the right half of the complex plane, basically Re(z) > 0
[09:54:17] <Fangs> pretty sure if I remove the negative imaginary line, I'll be parameterizing the plane with Im(z) > 0

[11:16:23] <int-e> greenbagels: FWIW, truncating Heap's algorithm is easy; you don't just truncate permutations, you also truncate the call tree that generates them. You just need to get the even/odd check for the tree levels right; it's based on alternating between a call not affecting the permutation, and a call producing a cyclic shift of the remaining elements in the permutation...
[11:17:14] <greenbagels> int-e: that makes sense, i noticed that pattern when i looked at the flow chart on the wiki's image
[11:17:20] <int-e> Imagine going through highschool with that surname.
[11:17:29] <greenbagels> Heap?
[11:17:33] <int-e> yeah
[11:18:12] <greenbagels> sounds like a heap of... ah nevermind
[11:18:21] <Fangs> re:my question. I think you can flat out show that the limit as z -> 0 is bounded, so if you want to use a sledge-hammer you can just cite the removable singularity theorem
[11:19:20] <cherim> But why would you want to do it
[11:21:03] <cherim> There is a cituation where this is important, namely the fact that a Riemann surface of, say, z^{1/n} has all points regular
[11:22:12] <cherim> There you treat z=0 and any z!=0 differently, but the vicinity of z=0 is still the usual disk, just glued in not by z->z but by z->z^n
[11:22:41] <cherim> Otherwise I'd prefer to always have the branch point inside the cut
[11:23:49] <Fangs> cherim: I think youre saying that we can just say sqrt(0) = 0

[19:48:11] <Simplar> qed, is it a probability with a discrete uniform distribution?
[19:48:25] <qed> yes Simplar
[19:48:30] <Simplar> I think it is, every stone has equal chance to be marked or not
[19:49:09] <Simplar> then it's the arithmetic mean of all values of unmarked stones that can exist
[19:49:20] <Simplar> There is a tiny but a chance that only one stone gets marked
[19:49:27] <Simplar> so it's from 1 to 9
[19:49:32] <qed> it is simply 10*(1-1/10)^7
[19:50:51] <Simplar> (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)/9 = 5. And 10*(1-1/10)^7 approx. = 4.78

[19:51:13] <Gurkenglas> To understand my matrix J I want to cluster its rows. It would send a the standard multivariate normal distribution around 0 to one with covariance matrix JJ^T. Any subset of rows forms a matrix R, and RR^T is JJ^T without some rols&cols. It seems sensible to cluster together R and R' if knowing Rx tells me a lot about R'x. This mutual information is det(RR^T)*det(R'R'^T)/det(JJ^T). So I might start with singleton
[19:51:13] <Gurkenglas> row sets and repeatedly cluster the two closest sets to get a binary tree hierarchy. Are there computational tricks for this, or even names for what I'm doing?

[20:07:41] <int-e> cherim: What I had is: Pick a coordinate system parallel to the outer box; each dimension of the bounding box of the inner box is the sum of the absolute values of the corresponding dimensions of the three sides (as vectors in the chosen coordinate system); the sum of these is the sum of the L_1 norms of the three sides, which is larger than the sum of the L_2 norms (by the triangle inequality,...
[20:07:47] <int-e> ...really; the norms are just needlessly cute; the triangle solution does not need an orthogonal outer box).
[20:11:10] <Z-module> int-e, so that bounding box has faces parallel to the corresponding ones of the outer box?
[20:11:23] <int-e> Z-module: yes
[20:11:44] <int-e> we could assume that it is the outer box without loss of generality (shrinking the outer box if necessary)

[20:16:29] <cherim> Probably you can declare orientations to be consistent with the solid diagonal
[20:16:39] <int-e> it's really obvious that if you start at the leftmost point, you can only move right along the three edges (in 6 different ways) to reach the rightmost point.
[20:17:56] <cherim> Yes, I think this works
[20:18:05] <cherim> Here's the original
[20:18:12] <int-e> (I'm mentally identifying parallel edges because I treat them as vectors)
[20:18:12] <cherim> Let X(t) be the volume of the set of points at distance <=t from the box
[20:18:18] <cherim> Then X(t) = ABC + t(2AB+2BC+2AC) + t^2 pi (A+B+C) + t^3 (4/3 pi), with clear meaning of separate terms
[20:18:21] <cherim> If box #1 fits inside box #2, then X2(t)-X1(t)>=0 for all t>=0

[21:41:08] <RadSurfer> How is 'Vector Product' different from 'Geometric Product'?
[21:41:27] <somiaj> RadSurfer: Vector Product isn't that well defined, there are multiple vector products.
[21:41:43] <somiaj> And what do you mean by geometric product, to see the difference, let look at the definitions of your products
[21:41:53] <mawk> vector product is cross product right?
[21:41:59] <mawk> at least when I was taught it
[21:42:03] *** Quits: Bayes (~Bayes@user/bayes) (Quit: Connection closed)
[21:42:46] <RadSurfer> another confusion is I see 'magnitude of crossprod' to use sin(theta), then I see same definition for Outer product!
[21:42:50] <somiaj> mawk: cross product is only defined in a very limited circumstance, inner products (dot) are far more common and defined in different places
[21:43:21] <mawk> somiaj yes indeed, I mean the name "vector product" has been used to refer to the 3D cross product for me
[21:43:30] <mawk> but it's maybe a language thing
[21:43:53] <joel135> 'geometric product' is a thing in GA (geometric algebra)
[21:44:04] <mawk> you also find it elsewhere I believe
[21:44:14] <mawk> it's pretty much the same as exterior product right?
[21:44:19] <mawk> in differential geometry
[21:44:22] <somiaj> It could be, to me vector product is vague, because there are various ways to multiply vectors together, Im' more use to 'cross product' and 'dot product' if talking about R^3 or R^n, and inner product as a more general dot product
[21:45:03] <mawk> the product of exterior algebra
[21:46:01] <quantum> mawk: The geometric product is related to the exterior (wedge) product, but they're not the same thing
[21:46:20] <mawk> RadSurfer the exterior product can be used to define the 3D cross product so yes it's not surprising to have similarities such as the magnitude

[21:46:37] <somiaj> RadSurfer: You might also need to be careful about context, usually outter product isn't defined in the context of say vectors in R^3 (which is where the cross product is defined).
[21:46:46] <joel135> according to grassmann, the geometric product was pretty much exterior product, but according to clifford/hestenes/... it involves a combination of the exterior product and the inner product. the exterior product generalizes the cross product to higher dimensions without the need for a metric even
[21:47:01] <somiaj> and as mentioned, some are generalziations and related, but they are often defintiions for more general spaces.
[21:47:22] <RadSurfer> I'll refer to this text as I continue to study.
[21:47:45] <mawk> ah right I remember now quantum
[21:47:59] <mawk> it's like adding the inner product with the exterior product
[21:48:02] <quantum> joel135 summarises it pretty well
[21:48:09] <joel135> ^^
[21:49:11] <mawk> with the exterior product and some other tools you can define all operators from physics like divergence or curl just with the product, I found it pretty cool
[21:49:21] <quantum> it's certainly neat
[21:50:30] <quantum> in the modern usage though, the geometric/Clifford product is distinct from the exterior product
[21:50:45] <mawk> yes
[21:50:51] <quantum> since they refer to subtly different algebras
[21:51:33] <quantum> there's a very nice way of recovering the exterior algebra of an inner product space from the Clifford algebra

[23:46:54] <qergle> so your original matrix does this: sends (1 0) to (1 0) and (0 1) to (0 -1)
[23:46:54] <Gustavo6046> maybe nesting a row of multiplicands in each coordinate
[23:47:17] <qergle> is that what you wanted?
[23:47:52] <Gustavo6046> so <1, 2> * ( (1 0), (0 -1) ) = (1 × 1 + 0 × 2,   1 × 0 + 2 × -1) = (0, -2)
[23:47:56] <Gustavo6046> qergle: yeah
[23:48:03] <Gustavo6046> that's how basis vectors wrork
[23:48:05] <Gustavo6046> work*
[23:48:06] <Z-module> Atsuko:   1 GiB is 10^20 bytes = 1048576.  4.86 times that is exactly  5096079.36
[23:48:20] <Z-module> sorry, 2^20
[23:48:34] <qergle> Gustavo6046: you mneant (1,-2) not (0,-2), right?
[23:48:53] *** Parts: savask (~savask@Powder/Developer/savask) ()
[23:49:25] <Gustavo6046> Ah
[23:49:27] <Gustavo6046> true
[23:49:31] <Gustavo6046> yeah :p
[23:49:32] <Z-module> wow, google is totally wrong
[23:49:43] <Z-module> I want my Google-user fee refunded
[23:49:49] <mawk> 2^10 = 10^3
[23:49:50] <Gustavo6046> Z-module: depends if it's GiB or GB
[23:49:51] *** Joins: Juliu (~Juliu@2a02:810b:c640:514:e148:51ed:f003:eb83)
[23:49:56] <mawk> everyone knows that
[23:50:01] <Gustavo6046> but
[23:50:02] <Z-module> yes, Atsuko said GiB
[23:50:05] <mawk> so no need to differentiate GB and GiB
[23:50:09] <Gustavo6046> it can also be mixing SI and IEC intermediates
[23:50:11] <Gustavo6046> so 1024 MiB * 1000
[23:50:17] <Gustavo6046> which is a frankeistein of GB and GiB
[23:50:26] <Gustavo6046> er
[23:50:27] <mawk> the compromise gigabyte
[23:50:31] <Gustavo6046> a Frankenstein's monster*
[23:50:43] <Gustavo6046> it could also be 1000 MiB * 1024
[23:50:49] <Gustavo6046> erm
[23:50:51] <mawk> 1012 bytes instead of 1024 bytes
[23:50:51] <Gustavo6046> wat
[23:50:53] <Gustavo6046> I mean
[23:50:57] <Gustavo6046> 1024 MB or 1000 MiB
[23:50:57] <mawk> that's the better compromise imho
[23:51:03] <Gustavo6046> mawk: lol
[23:51:12] <Z-module> oh sorry, I was doing KiB, not GiB
[23:51:15] <Gustavo6046> isn't that geometric average?
[23:51:19] <mawk> no
[23:51:22] <mawk> arithmetic
[23:51:24] <Gustavo6046> ah
[23:51:32] <qergle> 4.86 gib = 4.86*(1024)^3 ≈ 5.2*10^9
[23:51:35] <Gustavo6046> but an average is like the middle point
[23:51:37] <Z-module> I mean MiB, not Gib
[23:51:39] <mawk> yes
[23:51:43] <mawk> arithmetic average
[23:51:43] <Gustavo6046> so isn't it kinda like a geometric concept?
[23:51:55] <mawk> geometric average of a and b is √ab
[23:52:00] <Gustavo6046> ohhh
[23:52:01] <mawk> arithmetic is (a+b)/2
[23:52:07] <Gustavo6046> I see
[23:52:09] <mawk> geometric average is the midpoint on a log scale
[23:52:11] <Gustavo6046> ahh
[23:52:17] <Gustavo6046> kkinda like in arithmetic and geometric series
[23:52:23] <mawk> eg geometric average of 10^10 and 10^20 is 10^15
[23:52:27] <mawk> yeah
[23:52:29] <qergle> bc gives the exact number without rounding: echo "4.86*(1024)^3" | bc -l

[23:53:34] <Atsuko> thanks Z-module
[23:54:17] <mawk> but yes arithmetic average is a geometric concept Gustavo6046
[23:54:24] <mawk> it's the midpoint between the two points
[23:54:28] <qergle> however can
[23:54:48] <mawk> there's as much stuff on the left of the average as there is on the right
[23:54:55] <qergle> however can't get 16 25'ths of 8, so the original problem wasn't exact.
