[02:28:15] <buster> Guest57: There you have k equations in n unkowns (where n=2 and k=1). The set of solutions will be an (n-k)-dimensional submanifold of the n-dimensional space {(x,y)}=R^2

[02:28:38] <buster> a curve
[02:28:57] <Guest57> why is it n-k?
[02:29:40] <Juliu> Guest57, so since you know the 2 solutions now, you can also write your polynomial as (y - 0) * (y - 4), or y * (y - 4) for short. Which was quite obvious since both terms of your initial polynomial contained a y factor

[03:05:58] <quantum> tl;dr: you can algebraically extend the field of two elements so that your equation has solutions
[03:06:02] <Juliu> Let me try again:
[03:06:13] <quantum> this is akin to adding in imaginary numbers, and it's very well studied
[03:06:37] <Juliu> What did we do once we discovered that x^2 = -1 has no solution in R ?
[03:07:26] <Juliu> quantum, yes, you can, but you will end up with more than just 2 or 3 elements. Which is what I said earlier
[03:08:40] <Juliu> ... We extended R. So what should we do when we discover that x and not x = true has no solution in {true, false} ? We should extend it!
[03:10:22] <Juliu> That's why I called it imaginary boolean. Because that is pretty much what it is

[03:22:06] <Juliu> quantum, I came up with the inside that we need infinitely many constants since you can always find a combination of equations that requres us to have a new constant
[03:22:28] <Juliu> But I'm not sure

[03:23:56] <quantum> I really need to revise my Galois knowledge
[03:25:03] <Juliu> quantum, once you find a constant other than true or false, you can plug it into the equation    x and not x = new_constant,   which will probably require you to find yet another constant for x
[03:25:05] <quantum> Juliu: That's a slightly different question, but I think it's equivalent to "What is the cardinality of the algebraic closure of F2?"
[03:25:23] <quantum> In which case the answer is that it must be countably infinite

[03:34:51] <Juliu> quantum, since I have no clue about algebra, please explain it with words

[03:36:50] <dude12312414> Juliu: so you want to extend the definition of AND, NOT, OR, etc to a domain larger than {T, F} in such a way that there exists some constant X in some larger domain satisfying X AND NOT X = T?

[03:45:46] <dude12312414> because the solution set is defined by finitely many of these equations, so they lie in a finite subfield of the algebraic closure

[03:57:56] <quantum> showing rapid development
[03:58:01] <Juliu> Like I said earlier, it doesnt seem to be researched a lot. At least not for boolean things
[03:58:18] <quantum> well the language is going to be different
[03:58:28] <Juliu> Or at least most people dont realize that {True, False} is not enough
[03:59:46] <quantum> the difficulty with applying this to boolean logic is that you don't get results which are very useful to a logician
[03:59:48] <Juliu> The nice thing about those imaginary booleans (or whatever we want to call them) is, that you can still continue to calculate even if you hit a paradox like   x and not x = true
[04:00:11] <quantum> this is really more of a fact about algebra than it is about logic
[04:00:53] <Juliu> quantum, complex numbers as results are also not very helpful in most cases. We just calculate with them and drop the imaginary results in the end

[04:02:45] <Juliu> I think the whole discussion in here proves that most people never have thought about it
[04:03:37] <quantum> well, not in the context of logic at least
[04:04:04] <Juliu> Yes
[04:04:28] <Juliu> Although a critic might argue that I first have to find something where this is useful :D
[04:06:12] <Juliu> But I find it fascinating to philosophize (is that even a word?) about the consequences for real life. Since this means that sentences are not either true or false, or things are not either there or not there
[04:13:51] <quantum> Juliu: Honestly, if you want to look into this further, I'd recommend Cori and Lascar's Mathematical Logic
[04:14:07] <quantum> They mention the algebraic setting and do some interesting things with it iirc
[04:14:30] <quantum> It's also really good for exercises
[04:14:53] <Juliu> quantum, since I have no clue about algebra, it would probably be over my head
[04:15:20] <quantum> it doesn't assume any algebraic knowledge afaik

[06:49:44] <Fangs> so again, suppose that q: \Del^n \to X is some n-cell (or w/e they are called), so consider Del^n -q-> X -i-> Y -g-> Y, but equivariance means that the image of g(i(q(t))) = i(gq(t)), so this just mean g sends an n-cell in X to an n-cell in X... so Homgy(X) -i*-> Homgy(Y).. I think this just says the image of i* is again in the image of i*
[06:50:31] <Fangs> so I think that's how you get the statement that the image of i* is the classes in Homgy(Y)^G, invariant under G

[07:11:59] <barravince_> because you are counting r quarters out of m  boxes. If you draw these on a line and try to fit the quartes within all boxes, then you would have m positions to choose from

[08:49:13] <qergle> yes

[11:12:51] <droid3> And another thing is how can one check all the 1/2+ti numbers under a certain bound there is infinitely many zeros in any bound to check. Being that t is real!
[11:13:26] <droid3> Those are my two issues when it comes to computing nontrivial zeros of zeta function.
[11:14:02] <droid3> Right at the moment i can just compute a random 1/2+ti value for the zeta function out to any degree of accuracy i want using bignum libraries.
[11:14:34] <droid3> But the next step was turning this program into a program that could compute zeros/ verify its a zero or not.

[11:28:37] <newpy> qergle, yes I thought I could still call it a binomial random variable if it only had one trial
[11:28:48] <newpy> but I guess then it is called bernoulli
[11:29:20] <qergle> you can call it a binomial with n=1, but then you must specify
[11:29:24] <droid3> like when is the zeta function provable zero as opposed to some ridiculously unlikely ramanujan  constant or something
[11:29:42] <qergle> you asked about "binomial rv" generically, so you can't drop the n
[11:29:50] <newpy> ic
[11:30:34] <droid3> and then if i can figure that out. I still have the issue of how do you systematically go thru all of the 1/2 + ti  where t< Bound if t can be any real number???
[11:31:26] <droid3> there only infinite possibilities as opposed to restricting to just integers for t that is much easier if i got a provable way to say yes this is a zero.

[15:04:54] <riv> hi
[15:05:18] <riv> X_g is the bracelets which are invariant under the transformation g
[15:05:23] <Fangs> why D_8 and not S_8?
[15:05:47] <Fangs> how does D_8 act on a the five red beads and three blue beads?
[15:05:49] <int-e> Fangs: this is putting beads on a string and then tying that into a loop
[15:06:00] <int-e> or was that a guiding question?
[15:06:01] <cadmio>  D8 because you can flip the bracelet over and its the same one.
[15:06:05] <int-e> if so, sorry
[15:06:12] <Fangs> int-e: the former was not, the latter was haha
[15:06:30] <Fangs> ok I guess the former was accidentally too
[15:06:49] <cadmio> riv: yes so for example id fixes all the configurations which should be binom(8 3) = 56
[15:07:00] <riv> yes good
[15:07:01] <int-e> Fangs: it was hard to tell because evidently you answered it for yourself between those two messages :P

[15:07:33] <riv> are any bracelets fixed by rotation at all?
[15:07:53] <cadmio> rotation of beads should lead to the same configuration

[15:08:56] <riv> try to list all of the bracelets which are rotation invariant
[15:09:25] <int-e> maybe considering D_8 as a subgroup of S_8 is actually helpful for this... consider an element of S_8. What property does it have to have to fix a particular sequence of red and blue beads?

[16:18:44] <Fangs> [itchyjunk]: if (a,b) are points corresponding to a+ib in the complex plane, you'd need a 2x2 matrix to map points in C to C (thinking C as R (+) iR)

[16:48:59] <qergle> greenbagels: so i ended up doing a haskell crash-course, enough to decipher the code, and re-wrote into working beautiful C.
[16:49:02] <[itchyjunk]> how DO i know it's linear?!?
[16:49:13] <riv> the linearity axioms are all satisfied
[16:49:14] <qergle> now i must figure out how to most quickly forget this haskell stuff

[16:49:37] <riv> yeah
[16:49:46] <[itchyjunk]> wait, homomorphism axioms?
[16:49:52] <riv> you use C for both the coefficients and the vectors
[16:49:59] <riv> no
[16:50:04] <[itchyjunk]> hmmm
[16:50:55] <[itchyjunk]> google is not telling me what linearity axioms are

[16:51:10] *** Quits: Crescendo (~Crescendo@user/crescendo) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[16:51:14] <int-e> [itchyjunk]: C is an R-vector space. You can verify that x |-> x*a is a linear map for any a in C.
[16:51:41] <int-e> [itchyjunk]: you can also just write out the operation and read off the corresponding matrix.
[16:51:50] <riv> oh wait actually yeah use R for coefficients and C for vectors
[16:52:58] <barravince> How many ways are there to select 3 tokens from 100 numbered with a unique integer from 1 100 are there if none of the tokes has a number which is divisible by six?

[16:53:21] <[itchyjunk]> hmm
[16:53:35] <barravince> then the anser should be C(84,3)

[17:44:04] <[itchyjunk]> uhh about that finding w being trivial in the first case
[17:44:08] <[itchyjunk]> i can't seem to find it
[17:44:27] <[itchyjunk]> i have xu + yv = u^2 + v^2 and yu = xv
[17:44:40] <[itchyjunk]> so i tried substituting u = xv/ y in the first equation
[17:45:13] <riv> xheimlich, I think that you can't do it this way without it being.... circular
[17:45:44] <xheimlich> rlv: Logs are different for complex numbers, that's the rub.
[17:45:53] <xheimlich> Anyway for pedagogical purposes at least.
[17:46:25] <xheimlich> Logs = the inverse of the exponential function.
[17:46:55] <xheimlich> since we're trying to isolate z.
[17:47:25] <rubiksdream> how can you define exp on C without defining z = 0 + 1i ?
[17:47:30] <Z-module> [itchyjunk]: which problem now?
[17:47:52] <[itchyjunk]> the one you said was turbotrivial. find w such that z/w = 1 :s
[17:47:54] <xheimlich> rubiksdream: you probably can start by defining the complex numbers axiom.. oh
[17:48:09] <[itchyjunk]> let z = (x,y) and w = (u,v), i get the two equations
[17:48:15] <rubiksdream> well, then you will end up defining i xheimlich
[17:48:22] <xheimlich> yes.
[17:48:28] <[itchyjunk]> where yu = xv is one of them so i replace u = xv/y in the other one
[17:49:23] <xheimlich> anyway, there's something neat about passing from power functions of integral exponents to exponential functions that maps to the passage from discrete to continuous-time processes.
[17:49:43] <Fangs> [itchyjunk]: xu + yv = u^2 + v^2 <-- can you select x and y to make this true?
[17:49:47] <xheimlich> I can see now how this intuition works for f(n)=i^n
[17:50:00] <xheimlich> Like "complex-valued interest rates".
[17:50:22] <[itchyjunk]> Fangs, (u,v) seems to work
[17:50:27] <rubiksdream> yes, its natural to define powers entirely in terms of exp and Log once these things have been defined

[22:13:55] <cherim> Summing over partitions is the heavy mainstream thing. You can sum it to the p^{n(n-1)} end with enough technique, but the problem is about avoiding this

[23:15:43] <buster> it probably isn't worth getting too fussy about it. if you can find the difference in latitude going 100m north, and the difference in longitude going 100m east, you can stretch the circle vertically and horizontally by those factors.
