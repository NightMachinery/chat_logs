[15:54:27] <Altreus> more specific please
[15:54:32] <Gin> I am using @{[...]} now.
[15:54:38] <Altreus> that is common
[15:55:01] <Altreus> you can also my $val = expr; "... $val ..."
[15:55:02] <Gin> print "@{[$x+$y]}";
[15:55:06] <vague> Maybe you should give a concrete example
[15:55:12] <Altreus> You can also sprintf "... %s ...", expr
[15:55:24] <Altreus> You can also " ... " . expr . " ... "
[15:55:38] <Gin> Emm, I just don't want to split my string.
[15:55:57] <Altreus> @{[ ... ]} is fine
[15:56:02] <Altreus> :)

[15:56:59] <vague> I usually use sprintf when I want to insert data into a string
[15:57:00] <Gin> Altreus: Yep, I am aware of that
[15:57:09] <xq> use sprintf
[15:57:20] <Gin> But I just don't think it is quite elegant.
[15:57:28] <Altreus> sprintf gives you more control yeah
[15:57:56] <Gin> I am familiar with sprintf.
[15:58:06] <vague> Or printf if you just want to print it straight away
[15:58:24] <Gin> I would like to exploit other possibilities when I use print
[15:59:07] <Gin> What I want is to evaluate an expression within a string, just like a variable does.
[15:59:25] <vague> Why?
[15:59:38] <Gin> For example, print "$x" will evaluate the variable for me.
[15:59:39] <ology> sprintf ftw
[15:59:59] <vague> What you want and what is sensible don't necessarily equate
[16:00:31] <Gin> vague: That is why I want to discuss and make an attempt.
[16:00:44] <vague> You've been told several options, use them
[16:01:02] <vague> If you have a problem with them, explain why it won't work for you
[16:01:15] <Altreus> one does not really evaluate variables in this sense; they are the result of evaluating something else

[16:01:42] <Gin> Altreus: I got your point.
[16:01:48] <gustaf> Boromir meme - "one does not simply evaluate a variable"

[17:06:25] *** Joins: Judabuda (~ok@user/judabuda)
[17:06:27] <Altreus> because $j++ is 0 on that line and 1 on the next line

[17:12:44] <demostanis[m]> No, print the item at the same index in each array
[17:13:52] <Altreus> ok
[17:13:58] <Altreus> So really the important value is the index
[17:14:20] <Altreus> So you should loop over those: for my $j (keys @{ $letters[0] } )
[17:15:00] <Altreus> Then you still need another for loop, because you need to print the letter at $j for each of @letters, right?
[17:15:26] <Altreus> for my $letter_array ( @letters ) { print $letter_array->[$j] }
[17:15:34] <demostanis[m]> That's `	print "@{$_}\n" for$letters[$j];`
[17:15:59] <demostanis[m]> Why [$j]?
[17:16:18] <Altreus> no, that's print the whole array at $letters[$j], but $j is not an index into @letters, it's an index into $letters[0] or [1] or whatever
[17:16:57] <Altreus> $j is a column number, not a row number
[17:17:43] <demostanis[m]> Why would my code print the line?
[17:17:52] <demostanis[m]> $letters[$j] is an array of strings?
[17:18:01] <Altreus> Don't know what $letters[$j] is
[17:18:23] <Altreus> $letters[0] is someting like ['D','D','D','D'] right
[17:18:30] <demostanis[m]> Yes

[17:18:45] <demostanis[m]> got it

[17:19:36] <demostanis[m]> Waitttt noooo
[17:19:37] <demostanis[m]> $letters[0] = ('DDDDD'. 'DD DD',...)
[17:19:47] <demostanis[m]> It doesn't split on char but on newlines
[17:19:51] <demostanis[m]> That's what you meant?
[17:19:54] <Altreus> oh yeah newlines, right
[17:19:59] <Altreus> so yeah
[17:20:45] <Altreus> If you do for @letters, first it gets ['ddddddd'], then ['d      d'], then ...
[17:21:03] <Altreus> (ignoring the blank line that you should probably deal with)
[17:21:09] <demostanis[m]> Why in an array?
[17:21:28] * Altreus looks again
[17:21:48] <Altreus> no I said something different from what I meant :D
[17:22:00] <Altreus> @letters is two arrays, one with all the ddddd and one with all the iiii, line by line
[17:22:45] <Altreus> so if you loop @letters after you have $j, then you'll basically get [ddd]->[0], [iii]->[0]; [ddd]->[1], [iii]->[1]; etc
[17:22:55] <Altreus> where $j is 0, then 1, then etc
[17:23:47] <Altreus> That's: for my $j( @{ $letters[0] } ) { print $_->[$j] for @letters }
[17:25:12] <Altreus> note there are no newlines in this at the moment :)
[17:25:23] <Altreus> you can use say instead of print for that

[21:12:22] <ilmari> simcop2387: the libera<->matrix irc bridge is up and running
[21:12:35] * ilmari_ waves from #perl:libera.chat 
[21:12:42] <simcop2387> nice
[21:13:13] <ilmari_> I really like that they've given the IRC bridge the entire homeserver namespace, so no #libera prefix
[21:13:31] <ilmari_> #_libera_, even (stupid markdown)
[21:14:07] <simcop2387> yea that'll be a lot nicer than the old freenode one.  i think that was because getting that setup properly as a service wasn't really doable on the old ircd
[21:15:44] <ilmari_> that part doesn't really depend on the IRCd (other than that they have to RESV the matrix-side bridge bot's name, since that would clash). but they did have to modify both the matrix homeserver and the irc bridge, afaik
[21:16:17] <ilmari_> it's still a separate client connection for each bridged user
[21:17:46] <ilmari_> the feature request for it to be an actual server in the IRC network is over 4 years old: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/329 is

[21:19:49] <simcop2387> ilmari: i see, i thought maybe that's what they did (i.e. libera was running the matrix homeserver that was ported into the ircd cluster)
[21:20:07] <ilmari> nope, they didn't have time to do that

[21:30:29] <Yaakov>  simcop2387: I am using Node-RED with a variety of hardware, and I was going to do stuff in javascript for obvious reasons, but I was thinking that the stuff that didn't need to be internal to Node-RED maybe I will do perl.
[21:31:34] <Yaakov> But, the choice of modules seems... underwhelming. Net::MQTT::Simple from Juerd works fine but it is purposely *very* limited.

[21:35:39] <simcop2387> can't say I have.  but I have used node-red to start creating some interesting home automation stuff since it can emulate a bunch of smart-home devices.  I had my christmas tree driven by it last year.  rgb lights and color changing and everything.

[21:38:25] <Yaakov> I have a bunch of SmartThings stuff but I am looking to move to HomeKit for various reasons.
[21:38:53] <Yaakov> Still, Node-RED means that HomeKit is just the front end.
[21:39:03] <simcop2387> yea it works ok but they're starting to annoy me with their app a bit.  i figure if i'm going to deal with pain anyway i'll try to go completely open source then if i can
[21:39:42] <Yaakov> Shelly is pretty amazing. MQTT support, plus it has URL callbacks for events if you want.
[21:40:32] <simcop2387> ive been at Tasmota for building my own stuff, similar features it sounds like

[21:41:36] <Yaakov> Yes, similar but slicker. I am not married to open source for everything and this is usable OOTB.
[21:43:28] <simcop2387> yea i'm not necessarily married to it either, most AC stuff i'll probably go with something like the shelly or other zwave/zigbee stuff but I've decided that for the hub side of things i want complete control over it.  some time ago smartthings decided that they'll completely lock out mobile firefox users from being able to log in to their app and asking for it to be added back gets a response
[21:43:34] <simcop2387> of, "All android devices must use Chrome.  Can you see if using Chrome makes firefox mobile support work?"
[21:43:40] <Yaakov> Web interface, and you can use the app at the same time. https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/GtpgcLcf/shelly.png
[21:44:03] <thrig> Chrome is a funny way to spell Internet Explorer 6
[21:44:06] <Yaakov> It supports MQTT very nicely as well.
[21:44:25] <simcop2387> neat
[21:45:37] <Yaakov> And, while not as cheap as Sonoff, not bank-busting either. That's a Shelly 1, they have a version with a current sensor too. And a lot of other stuff.

[22:22:49] <Juerd> Yaakov: Apart from QoS, Net::MQTT::Simple, does almost everything you could need
[22:23:12] <Juerd> Yaakov: And I've noticed that QoS isn't used in most applications. When it is, it's usually implemented in such a way that it doesn't make sense in the first place.
[22:23:49] <thrig> or you have a firewall that's applying VOIP QoS to your regular application traffic and someone has to spend a while staring at tcpdumps to figure out where the slowness is coming from
[22:24:08] <Juerd> thrig: MQTT QoS has nothing to do with TCP/IP QoS
[22:25:07] <simcop2387> yea mqtt qos basically affects if the mqtt server remembers the value for you or not
[22:25:32] <Juerd> With TCP/IP it's a performance thing, with MQTT it's a data integrity thing, similar to TCP (but MQTT itself is TCP, so most of the QoS features make no sense at all if you don't implement some kind of local storage)

[23:18:52] <pragma-> speaking of OOP perl, i came across conway's dios package the other day

[23:19:10] <pragma-> now thats certainly one way to do it :)
[23:19:52] <pragma-> theres a talk, "three little words", that explains why conway went about it the way he did

[23:20:02] <pragma-> its very interestimg
[23:20:31] <thrig> were the words "because conway qed"
[23:20:36] <El_Che> I saw his talk about it in yapce 2017
[23:21:27] <El_Che> it was presented as very closed to the perl 6 syntax, iirc
[23:22:14] <Yaakov> Hello, thrig.
[23:22:52] <pragma-> beasically PPI was too slow so he made PPR which... wait for it... parses perl with a single gigantic 1000 line regex

[23:24:22] <pragma-> for his use case it was significantly faster
[23:24:44] *** Joins: yzhernand (~yzhernand@129.85.9.140)
[23:24:50] <LeoNerd> And it annoys me every time he does so
[23:24:55] <xenu> giant regex *is* the most performant way to write a parser in perl
[23:24:57] <LeoNerd> Perl already /has/ a parser. You don't need to write a second one
[23:24:58] <xenu> which is sad
[23:25:22] <Grinnz> PPI and PPR are both hacks, for different but related usecases
[23:25:36] <Grinnz> PPI is for parsing an entire perl document, PPR is for parsing a subset
[23:25:47] <Juerd> Yaakov: Management?
[23:26:11] <El_Che> There Is More Than One Way To Parse It!
[23:26:15] <Yaakov> Juerd the docs say it won't retry connections.
[23:27:48] <Juerd> Yaakov: Ah. That's correct, but for most use cases you either need it to be realtime, or the value is repetatively available anyway.

[23:29:09] <Yaakov> Yes, most. But I have an application that might only generate a single message so I will have to do my own failure handling. It's not the end of the world though and I was already working on it.
[23:29:21] <Juerd> Yaakov: I see
[23:29:39] <Yaakov> Juerd: I've been using it a bit and it works great.
[23:29:52] <Juerd> Yaakov: Are you sure you want pub/sub then, not a queue of sorts?

[23:31:03] <Yaakov> Well, sort of. I am probably going to end up with a queue that uses MQTT to communicate because some things that I will be talking to only support that.
[23:31:17] <Juerd> Interesting
[23:31:46] <Yaakov> So far, I have just been using it without concern for the guarantee. It's tied up with home automation and security.
[23:32:35] <Yaakov> We'll see if I can work around the retries. I might just use an ACK for critical messages and so just keep trying until I get one, then MQTT doesn't have to be guaranteed.
[23:32:43] *** Quits: deadmarshal (~deadmarsh@95.38.113.167) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[23:33:10] <Yaakov> I would probably benefit from an architecture that doesn't depend on MQTT to do something it might not do.
[23:33:49] <Yaakov> Anyway, the module is easy and it's been a really great tool to glue stuff together for testing.
[23:33:52] <Yaakov> Thank you.
[23:34:06] <Juerd> You're welcome :)
[23:34:26] <Yaakov> Hmm... IRC over MQTT...
[23:34:32] <Juerd> Or vice versa :)
[23:34:36] <Yaakov> ...over DNS
[23:34:59] <Yaakov> I have already done that. I had a whole system of agents that used IRC.
[23:35:09] <Yaakov> I wish I had the code.
[23:35:25] <Yaakov> It allowed humans to join the channels and watch, and even interact.
[23:35:38] *** Quits: Deesl (~bsdboy@redhat/psirt/Deesl) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[23:36:31] <Yaakov> The channels were like a namespace for hosts and services, and the agents were basically IRC bots. The channel modes allowed me to make only certain users able to control things.
[23:36:45] <Yaakov> Logs were also sent to IRC channels.
[23:36:46] * GumbyPAN CPAN Upload: Date-QuarterOfYear-0.04 by NEILB https://metacpan.org/release/NEILB/Date-QuarterOfYear-0.04
[23:36:55] <Yaakov> It worked very well.
[23:36:59] <Juerd> Sounds like the time I couldn't choose between queue systems (in 2005 iirc) and eventually just built everything around actual emails
[23:37:10] <Yaakov> We also made a work queue...
[23:37:12] <Juerd> That worked perfectly, in production, handling high work loads
[23:37:12] <Yaakov> yes.
[23:37:23] <Juerd> And introspecting things via imap was a great addition :)
[23:37:44] <Yaakov> We used SMTP because it was already a completely implemented queue.
[23:37:51] <Yaakov> Sendmail, procmail, etc.
[23:37:51] <Juerd> incl. removing stuff from the queue, dragging things to other queues, etc  (except for race conditions)
[23:37:59] <Juerd> Yep :)
[23:38:03] <Juerd> Same tools
[23:38:14] <Yaakov> It worked really well, actually.
[23:38:30] * leont once did a presentation on "using protocols for different purposes because they fit"
[23:38:42] <leont> Email is a very close fit for Actor Model
[23:38:44] <Yaakov> Heya, leont.
[23:39:18] <Grinnz> "we used email. it worked perfectly"
[23:39:22] <Grinnz> not something you hear every day :D
[23:39:33] <thrig> not from Slack
[23:39:34] <Yaakov> Remember: the "S" in Internet protocols means "ripe for abuSe".
[23:39:44] <Juerd> Email is great in many ways but people mostly use it wrong
[23:39:55] <Yaakov> Grinnz: The trick is not to use it for email.
[23:40:19] <leont> Basically, yes
[23:40:49] <Yaakov> Email should be PULL, not PUSH. You can tell me that you'd like me to pick up some mail and I can ignore your spammy butt.
[23:41:47] <xenu> i don't see the difference, you'd still get a notification and that's all that matters
[23:41:50] <xenu> storage is cheap
[23:41:59] <thrig> clay pigeons, by coincidence, are also pull based
[23:42:07] <xenu> also that would make it less reliable
[23:42:38] <Yaakov> xenu: The idea is I don't have to listen to anyone that I don't already know should send me mail. 
[23:43:08] <leont> Sending an email needs to cost something, really (not necessarily money)
[23:43:22] <Adura> Bitcoin
[23:43:31] <Yaakov> xenu: I don't have to accept any mail at all if you are someone I don't know. Why would I want to? I don't believe I have ever received an unsolicited email that I wanted.
[23:44:00] <xenu> well, nothing is stopping you from blocking some/all senders
[23:44:02] <Yaakov> So, contact me some costly way and establish a relationship.
[23:44:28] <tm604> that's how email already works, though? MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, drop connection at that point if you don't want to proceed?
[23:44:35] <Yaakov> xenu: There is no mechanism to allow in only those I choose without a huge effort because there is no protocol to make that happen. 
[23:45:11] <xenu> also, notification/invitation spam is a thing
[23:45:22] <Yaakov> So I need some way to say, "send me an email about that" that isn't just an address, it has to be identifiable.
[23:45:27] <xenu> in fact, apparently recently spammers learned that a good way to spam someone is to add them to a spammy google calendar
[23:45:42] <Yaakov> Yes, and that's crappy.
[23:45:45] <simcop2387> yea there's a lot of spammers that would send out calendar invites to companies to get them to join calls because it's normal at the company to get them
[23:46:01] <thrig> that's not recent, spammers were putting calendar invites on apple calendars years ago
[23:46:05] <Yaakov> We need something like key exchange, via phones or watches, or something.
[23:46:20] <Grinnz> maybe we can use our new 5G microchips
[23:46:35] <tm604> every email address should be its own blockchain
[23:46:53] <Grinnz> tm604: a thousand managers just got aroused and don't know why
[23:46:53] <Yaakov> Every email should be an IoT node.
[23:47:10] <xenu> AI should determine whether the sender is worthy of messaging me
[23:47:11] <simcop2387> Grinnz: Only if you're using Genuine Microsoft Products?
[23:47:16] <simcop2387> hrm that didn't copy paste properly
[23:48:14] <Yaakov> Hell, AI should read and reply to the message and not bother me about it
