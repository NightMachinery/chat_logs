[01:20:36] <BarryDuggan[m]> subspace1486: have you worked through the https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Guided_Tutorial_PSK_Demodulation tutorial? Note that what you receive is a bit stream, but there is nothing to tell you where the byte boundaries are.
[01:20:50] <subspace1486[m]> Yes I've been actively looking at that
[01:21:05] <subspace1486[m]> this is for a Capture The Flag event, 10 minutes left
[01:21:29] <subspace1486[m]> something is just wrong with the way I'm unpacking bits or alignment or something, yet it ought to be working
[01:21:58] <subspace1486[m]> I'm seeing a long series of 0s instead of it properly repacking the data

[01:23:58] <subspace1486[m]> The mode is GPSK
[01:24:11] <muaddib[m]> What CTF??
[01:24:18] <subspace1486[m]> The output should be ASCII as the input is a TXT file
[01:24:35] <subspace1486[m]> they generated this GPSK signal from a TXT file, and most other flags have been ASCII
[01:24:53] <BarryDuggan[m]> it may be a packet. there is a tutorial for that: https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php?title=Packet_Communications
[01:27:04] <subspace1486[m]> <subspace1486[m]> "image.png" <- Its not a packet, this is the steps that they used for generating the signal
