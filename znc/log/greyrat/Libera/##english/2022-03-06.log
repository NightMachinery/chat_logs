[19:24:01] <pussipupu> Legally it's spring
[19:24:33] <pussipupu> I did barbeque yesterday, and some of the ice on the driveway has melted since my geoengineering experiment with soot!
[19:24:34] <CuriosTiger> but indeed, it appears the global average is 0.98°C. I had expected warmer, so I sit corrected.
[19:25:08] <CuriosTiger> Are you talking about the barbecue itself, or did you spread some soot deliberately to see if black snow would melt faster? :P

[20:24:46] <CuriosTiger> Cars.
[20:24:57] <CuriosTiger> Although that may be less true now than it was a generation ago.
[20:25:04] <CuriosTiger> Anime?
[20:25:04] <paul424> ohh cars might be 
[20:25:12] <paul424> hmm I don't own a car he neither :D
[20:25:30] <GuiToris> I think I've always been a girl, I've never been interested in cars
[20:25:53] <GuiToris> paul424, then you should talk about public transport :D
[20:25:56] <CuriosTiger> There are plenty of girls who are interested in cars.
[20:26:40] <GuiToris> they are generally blonde with big bosoms and low intelligence
[20:26:50] <paul424> How about a girls who are interested in getting cars through anarcho-syndicalism mode of production ? 
[20:26:57] <CuriosTiger> stereotype much, GuiToris ?
[20:27:26] <GuiToris> aren't stereotypes created because they are generally true?
[20:28:45] <CuriosTiger> In that case, you should be able to show a scientific correlation between blonde hair, big boobs, female gender and low intelligence.

[20:31:10] <pussipupu> Stereotypes sometimes have some basis in statistical truth, and often are just complete bullshit
[20:31:53] <GuiToris> I have the strange feeling that some people try to fit in their stereotype
[20:31:54] <pussipupu> that's a weird looking car
[20:32:08] <TimMc> They can also arise from nationalism, misunderstandings, and just weird historical prejudices.
[20:32:10] <GuiToris> I didn't notice there was a car in the picture

[20:39:02] <TimMc> GuiToris: If the woman in the picture were in my social circles, my prejudices would lead me to expect that she has a PhD and spends a lot of time making stuff on a CNC mill or something.
[20:39:21] <TimMc> Except she's leaning on that car like that, which means she probably wouldn't be in my social circles.

[21:30:12] <Jong> meaning you can't be both at the same time?
[21:30:27] <paul424> yes
[21:30:58] <TimMc> Jong: If you have two projects you want to work on, but not enough time/energy/money to work on both, you could say that those projects are mutually exclusive.
[21:30:59] <Jong> But then, aren't colors mutually exclusive? A pixel can't be red and yellow at the same time
[21:31:25] <Jong> Isn't whether a boolean variable is true or false also mutually exclusively?
[21:32:06] <TimMc> Usually you don't use it for simple things like that.
[21:32:13] <paul424> Jong, what is your ntative language ? 
[21:32:26] <TimMc> except in logic or game theory or something
[21:32:31] <Jong> Isn't whether someone is pregnant also mutually exclusive?
[21:32:45] <TimMc> No, that's not how you'd use it.
[21:32:52] <TimMc> I wouldn't use it for male/female either.
[21:33:01] <Jong> paul424 I grew up in USA but with foreign parents. So I dunno which language I learned first
[21:33:01] <paul424> TimMc, why ? 
[21:33:13] <TimMc> Not sure, it just doesn't work. :-)
[21:34:12] <TimMc> Usually it's two things that aren't in the same class as each other.
[21:34:17] <Jong> TimMc your saying that's not how you use it is why I'm having difficulty understanding the term
[21:35:17] <TimMc> One example I can turn up is someone saying that Catholicism and abortion are mutually exclusive -- meaning, if you're Catholic, you can't have an abortion, and if you have an abortion, that means you're not Catholic.
[21:35:37] <TimMc> (The truth or falsity of this statement is beyond the scope of this channel, of course...)
[21:36:06] <TimMc> It generally means... hmm, maybe "you can't have both".

[21:37:10] <TimMc> Someone else says that capitalism and equality are mutually exclusive.
[21:38:32] <TimMc> Often it's framed as "you have to pick between these two", but it's different, semantically, than an object having a *property* that can only have one *value*.
[21:40:13] <TimMc> An object (or really, a point on an object) has the property of color, and that property can take one value.
[21:40:15] <Jong> What about mutually exclusive defenses by a defendant? Like an alibi that he wasn't there, and the defense that he witnessed someone else do it.  You can't both not be at the scene of the crime and also have seen in person who committed the crime.
[21:40:59] <TimMc> Yeah, I think you could say that those statements are mutually exclusive.
[21:41:13] <TimMc> although I might instead say "logically inconsistent", in this case

[22:38:16] <GuiToris> That's what I meant, I just wanted to emphasize which part is the question
[22:38:28] <twb> GuiToris: I would accept either "damage" or "damages" there.
[22:38:40] <GuiToris> is 'assess' good? I've never used it
[22:38:42] <TimMc> "Damages" in plural would usually refer to... I think a financial or legal context.
[22:38:50] <twb> I think "assessing the damage" is about the damage, and "assessing the damages" is about the insurance payout
[22:39:00] <TimMc> "Damage" singular would be more about physical damage, I think.
[22:39:06] <twb> TimMc: I agree
[22:39:35] <GuiToris> which one would you use for mental things?
[22:39:57] <TimMc> damage
[22:40:03] <GuiToris> thank you :)
[22:40:06] <TimMc> That's the more general term.
[22:40:37] <twb> I agree with that as well
[22:40:40] <TimMc> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/damages says the plural is for "The money paid or awarded to a claimant (in England), a pursuer (in Scotland) or a plaintiff (in the US) in a civil action as compensation for a loss suffered by the same."
[22:41:22] <GuiToris> there are more words that I don't know there than I actually know :O
[22:41:27] <TimMc> haha
[22:42:16] <TimMc> So, "damages" is the money paid out to the person filing a lawsuit, when they win and the judge or jury decides they are owed that money.
[22:43:13] <GuiToris> oh, so that's why it wasn't underlined by my spellcheck
