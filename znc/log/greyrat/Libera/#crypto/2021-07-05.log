[20:02:11] <wasamasa> that's IRC wisdom for you
[20:02:20] <wasamasa> many don't figure that part out and just leave forever
[20:03:28] *** Joins: CryptoClub (~fafs@static-173-3-7-89.ipcom.comunitel.net)
[20:03:38] <CPUOne> jbis: you using L3 OpenVPN or L2?
[20:03:48] <CPUOne> *layer 3 vs layer 2
[20:04:25] <jbis> 3 probably, but i haven't setup
[20:07:43] <jbis> OpenVPN seems to require one CA for both server certificates and client certificates. If you use a public CA then anyone with a cert from that CA can use your VPN. So you are virtually forced to use a self-signed CA. This creates a problem. How does the client authenticate the server? Nobody actually verifies fingerprints so they either don't or the CA has to be installed manually which is a PITA. Why not have two CAs, the 
[20:07:43] <jbis> public one for the server certificates. And then a self signed for client certificates. 1. Is this a dumb idea? 2. If so, why? If not so, than how can i configure this on openvpn? Their docs suck.
[20:08:31] <jbis> lmk if that question makes no sense
[20:09:12] <wasamasa> in practice clients don't do that
[20:09:24] <wasamasa> they just use the cert handed out by the VPN admin
[20:09:55] <jbis> yeah at open themselves to MITM attacks
[20:10:00] <jbis> and*
[20:11:08] <wasamasa> I don't see how using public certs mitigates that
[20:11:17] <wasamasa> nothing stops an attacker from getting a Let's Encrypt cert for free
[20:11:23] <wasamasa> which validates pretty much everywhere
[20:11:27] <jbis> Not for your domain
[20:11:53] <wasamasa> you just said public CA for server certificates
[20:12:29] <jbis> My domain is example.com. My clients want to connect to example.com VPN. I get a letsencrypt cert for example.com and present it to my clients, now they know they are talking to example.com (assuming they trust letsecrypt).
[20:12:45] <wasamasa> but do clients actually look at that?
[20:12:53] <jbis> Yes. Automatically.
[20:13:05] <wasamasa> because that's the part I doubt
[20:13:19] <wasamasa> how does the client know it may only trust an example.com cert and not an evil.com cert?
[20:13:45] <wasamasa> where does it have that information?
[20:14:03] <jbis> The client types "example.com". Now the application knows to only accept certs signed by a CA in the root store for "example.com". Same way a browser does it.

[20:14:51] <int-e> root certificates are shipped with OSes and/or browsers
[20:15:38] <Wulf> jbis: why do you believe that "OpenVPN [...] require[s] one CA for both server certificates and client certificates"?
[20:15:56] <int-e> sometimes I look at the list in Firefox and wonder how many governments can sign certificates that it'll accept without complaint
[20:16:05] <wasamasa> ok, so it's about the domain in the request matching the domain in the cert you get back
[20:16:41] <jbis> Wulf That's part of what I am asking about. Their docs suck so I can't tell if thats the case. But I only see one CA option in the config file that seems to be used for both.
[20:17:04] <int-e> Oh yeah, why would you need a CA to be involved?

[20:17:45] <wasamasa> > To use TLS mode, each peer that runs OpenVPN should have its own local certificate/key pair ( --cert and --key ), signed by the root certificate which is specified in --ca.
[20:17:58] <jbis> ^ Wulf
[20:18:03] <Wulf> jbis: openvpn docs are really good
[20:18:11] <wasamasa> they're kind of confusing though
[20:18:16] <Wulf> hmm
[20:18:21] <Wulf> well, usually
[20:18:23] <wasamasa> and then the paragraph explains how verification works
[20:18:52] <jbis> > When two OpenVPN peers connect, each presents its local certificate to the other. Each peer will then check that its partner peer presented a certificate which was signed by the master root certificate as specified in --ca.
[20:19:01] <wasamasa> I mean, I still don't see the problem
[20:19:11] <wasamasa> ship a private key, public key and CA file to every peer
[20:19:11] <Wulf> jbis: should be "as specified by the peer's --ca"
[20:19:36] <jbis> I don't wanna ship a CA to my clients.
[20:19:39] <wasamasa> why?
[20:19:50] <wasamasa> it's a local file, lol
[20:19:51] <Wulf> jbis: you don't have to. Clients can use a public CA.
[20:20:13] <Wulf> jbis: I haven't tried, but I'm confident that openvpn allows you do use separate CAs for client+server.
[20:20:13] <wasamasa> looking at the openvpn setups I have, they all use those three files
[20:20:22] <wasamasa> you can embed them inside the config if you want
[20:20:24] <jbis> Wulf so I can specify a different CA on server then on client and it won't create issues?
[20:20:51] <Wulf> jbis: I believe so. But I wouldn't actually do that and instead ship my own ca cert to the client.
[20:21:04] <jbis> Why?
[20:21:13] <wasamasa> I don't believe they allow that because of the above quote
[20:21:22] <wasamasa> master root certificate

[20:22:06] <Wulf> jbis: like when you use a web browser to access some https server
[20:22:47] <woggle> The server should not need to be verifying its own certificate, so I'd hope it wouldn't matter if it isn't configured with its own CA. But also, it looks like you could use --capath to configure multiple CA certs if that was an issue.

[20:24:16] <Wulf> jbis: can you use wireguard? ;-)
[20:24:20] <wasamasa> hahaha
[20:25:00] <CPUOne> I love wireguard
[20:27:38] <jbis> woggle I think --capath just adds most trusted CAs without distinguishing what they should be used for which doesn't fix the issue
[20:27:55] <jbis> Wulf Actually, I haven't looked at wireguard
[20:28:05] <jbis> Is it superior? 
[20:28:09] <CPUOne> it's amazing
[20:28:10] <Wulf> jbis: yep
[20:28:21] <woggle> jbis: As I said at the beginning, the server hopefully shouldn't need to verify its own CA, so you shouldn't need to specify it as part of the configuration....
[20:28:37] <Wulf> jbis: openvpn was really great. But I stopped using it as soon as wireguard was available for my devices.
[20:28:37] <woggle> Er, I mean its own cert is signed by its own CA.

[20:29:18] <jbis> woggle I agree, just no idea if OpenVPN realized that

[20:29:39] <Wulf> I say it will work.
[20:29:41] <woggle> I don't think it's a matter of "realizing it". It'd be extra work to code that in.
[20:30:24] <jbis> Why do you guys prefer wireguard? Just simplicity?
[20:31:14] <CPUOne> it's simple, fast, and gets the job done. Also, it's built into the linux kernel
[20:31:17] <Wulf> jbis: not having to deal with CAs for one.
[20:31:23] <jbis> Also kinda funny http://www.noiseprotocol.org/ uses http
[20:31:48] <CPUOne> jbis: not for me https://noiseprotocol.org/
[20:32:20] <jbis> Ah http just doens't redirect i guess
[20:32:32] <jbis> CPUOne, built into?
[20:32:36] <MacGyver> That "just" in "just simplicity" hides a huge discussion about the failings of cryptography in the past decades.
[20:32:37] <Wulf> jbis: enable "always https" in your browser.
[20:32:42] <CPUOne> yep, wireguard is in the linux kernel
[20:33:11] <MacGyver> I'd argue that simplicity of both interface and implementation is the most important property of *any* cryptographic system.
[20:33:38] <MacGyver> (Assuming correctness, of course)
[20:33:45] <jbis> agreed
[20:34:33] <CPUOne> jbis: right here sir https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/drivers/net/wireguard 
[20:35:05] <jbis> Why did they build it in?
[20:35:45] <CPUOne> having the vpn tunnel running in the kernel actually makes it faster. It eliminates the overhead of kernel to userspace copying
[20:36:01] <jbis> Interesting
[20:36:07] <MacGyver> It avoids the overhead of using the generic tun-driver.
[20:36:17] <jbis> Must be pretty damn good then if the kernal is going to endorse it

[20:38:03] <MacGyver> jbis: "Can I just once again state my love for it and hope it gets merged soon? Maybe the code isn't perfect, but I've skimmed it, and compared to the horrors that are OpenVPN and IPSec, it's a work of art."
