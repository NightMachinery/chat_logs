[06:30:50] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> They also adopted Bash and now Zsh.
[06:32:03] <tpefreedom> Those are not special to mac os.
[06:32:40] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> In very little time we'll have GNU/Linux running on the M1 devices. In the future, Apple hardware will be a larger share of free software platforms.

[06:40:53] <tpefreedom> Too bad we have to copy them ourselves.
[06:41:59] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> e.g. GNUstep
[06:42:35] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> Personally, the early OSX desktop environment drives me up the wall.
[06:43:02] <tpefreedom> GNUstep is NeXTstep, early osx. Not classic mac os or later osx or macos 11.
[06:44:01] <tpefreedom> I personally prefer the look of maco os 7 or 8 to early osx.

[06:45:45] <tpefreedom> My first (and technically only) desktop was a mac.
[06:46:07] <tpefreedom> I still have some nostalgia for Yosemite's GUI.
[06:46:54] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> Recently met a young woman with an M1 laptop. The terminal application was apparently super hidden. Heaven forbid end-users learn Bash or Zsh prior to needing it for troubleshooting.

[07:20:54] <DiffieHellman> MeowcatWoofWoofF: Just a note; GNU is not Unix. Apple has roots that go back to Unix and it's proprietary, so MacOS is somewhat close to Unix. Still, the slides say open source, so it's easy to see that the organisation isn't legitimate. 
[07:21:59] <DiffieHellman> MacOS ships some of the GNU utilities, but stopped when they went GPLv3 and stopped updating them. 
[07:22:57] <DiffieHellman> CUPS is decent, but apple has abandoned the version currently in use with GNU/Linux.
[07:25:01] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> GNU is, by any reasonable metric, the biggest cog in the Unix lineage. Without their partnership, Linux wouldn't have ever taken off, and we'd all be BSD nerds.
[07:26:02] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> Linux might technically be a "clone", but would we even have POSIX standards if GNU/Linux hadn't made waves?
[07:26:30] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> * even have widely-adopted POSIX standards
[07:26:43] <DiffieHellman> Unix was proprietary malware. GNU stands for GNU's not Unix and is not proprietary malware.
[07:27:22] <DiffieHellman> GNU is only Unix-like, so it's a gross mistake to call it "Unix".
[07:28:07] <DiffieHellman> Linux is a Unix-like monolithic kernel, sadly it does now contain proprietary malware out of the box.
[07:28:11] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> "GNU's not Unix" was coined prior to Linux existing, wasn't it? GNU has always intended to transcend Unix, but where do the fruits of their effort bloom most of the time?
[07:28:50] <DiffieHellman> The fruits of the effort bloomed being like Unix in some ways, but exceeding it in most.
[07:29:12] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> Unix-proper would be remarkably impoverished if not for GNU.
[07:30:44] <DiffieHellman> Yes, GNU was a better replacement for most Unix tools during development when Unix was commonly in use.
[07:32:12] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> So isn't saying "GNU's not Unix" both anachronistic and selling GNU short?
[07:33:37] *** Quits: aHick (~memes@143.60.228.11) (Remote host closed the connection)
[07:33:45] <DiffieHellman> GNU's not Unix is an exact representation of the arrangement and is not selling GNU short and GNU is far better than Unix.
[07:35:42] <DiffieHellman> In the past, for something to be a Unix, it needed to derive from the original AT&T Unix and you also needed a licence from AT&T. As AT&T no longer sells Unix, Unix hasn't been a thing for decades.
[07:36:18] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> For a period, people enjoyed GNU/Darwin, further separating GNU from the "Unix-like" Linux and Minix. The only cut-and-dry progress GNU has made away from the descendants of Unix is with Guix System and the Mach kernel.
[07:36:46] <DiffieHellman> GNU is not based off Unix code, so it was never and will never be Unix.

[07:40:52] <tpefreedom> the BSDs and illumos are still probably better suited for time-sharing.
[07:41:10] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> * Most professionals in the field disregard official registration because it's a pointless exercise. It doesn't mean they don't see themselves as "true" Unix.
[07:41:20] <DiffieHellman> MeowcatWoofWoofF: Yes, but it's still grossly incorrect to go calling Unix-like OS's Unix.
[07:42:43] <tpefreedom> The GPL is a great license.
[07:42:49] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> DiffieHellman: Keep in mind the majority of audiences only want to know the history of Unix influence (as opposed to Windows growing out of DOS).

[07:44:14] <DiffieHellman> tpefreedom: Yep, it gives you every freedom aside the freedom to take away others freedom.
[07:44:19] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> What concrete changes demarcate the line between Unix and Unix-like?
[07:44:33] <DiffieHellman> I just explained that, but I will again.

[07:50:17] <DiffieHellman> It's probably wisest just to call the OS by its name unless someone asks about the kind of OS design used.
[07:51:48] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> So it basically comes down to how much POSIX can or does get implemented?
[07:52:06] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> According to the wiki link.
[07:53:09] <DiffieHellman> It basically comes down to if you've paid the certification group and your OS passes the POSIX conformance test.
[07:55:45] <MeowcatWoofWoofF> Eh. I was surprised to see POSIX is the concrete bottleneck.

[15:19:10] <GNUmer> The authentication system here always requires a 2-step authentication and an authentication provider.

Since they've been lazy, they have just commissioned a

[19:33:54] <digitallillitera> Hello craigt. Many years ago I proposed an application called "Mailvelope" for entering the FSF. It was accepted at that time. I don't know if it status has changed since then and I don't know how to fint that out. Can you please help me?
[19:34:10] <digitallillitera> *FSF directory
[19:34:38] <hwpplayer1> I will be happy to work with you 
[19:34:50] <craigt> digitallillitera: let's take a look
[19:35:14] <hwpplayer1> ^
[19:35:38] <digitallillitera> Thank you. I can see it is at https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Talk:Mailvelope
[19:35:52] <craigt> digitallillitera: yup https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Mailvelope
[19:36:41] <digitallillitera> But I don't know it it still qualifies for being endorsed by the FSFDIRECTORY
[19:37:07] <digitallillitera> What should I do to know that?
[19:37:29] <craigt> digitallillitera, hwpplayer1: Let's reevaluate it.
[19:37:48] <craigt> digitallillitera, hwpplayer1: We can start by downloading a copy of the available source code.
[19:38:29] <digitallillitera> Where should I look for the available source code?
[19:38:39] <cyberbanjo> Its available on the directory
[19:38:56] <cyberbanjo> https://github.com/mailvelope/mailvelope/archive/master.zip
[19:39:13] <cyberbanjo> or git clone https://github.com/mailvelope/mailvelope/
[19:40:21] <digitallillitera>  Yes, I see https://github.com/mailvelope/mailvelope/archive/master.zip is in https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Mailvelope

[19:42:06] <craigt> Noisytoot: True, but we do want the latest free version.
[19:42:46] <hwpplayer1> yes latest is better
[19:43:00] <Noisytoot> craigt, master may not necessarily be free
[19:43:14] <Noisytoot> use the latest release/tag, if that doesn't exist, use the latest commit
[19:43:22] <Noisytoot> we can't verify that master will always be free

[20:01:02] <craigt> cyberbanjo: Yes. dependencies must be free as well.
[20:01:24] <digitallillitera> How do we find them?

[20:06:06] <digitallillitera> I think it is GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE. Am I wrong?
[20:06:57] <craigt> digitallillitera: We want to verify it, but yes it is GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 3.

[21:22:01] <GNUmer> My laptop is really giving out so I'm probably buying a Thinkpad X230 tomorrow. I'll get a Libreboot flashing kit and a wireless card with libre drivers as soon as I get my bank stuff done. I'm really looking forward to getting a libre system.
[21:23:06] <hwpplayer1> it is good GNUmer
[21:23:27] <Noisytoot> GNUmer, ThinkPad X230 does not support libreboot
[21:23:39] <Noisytoot> Only coreboot with blobs
[21:24:43] <GNUmer> It has Osboot support. Some blobs but less than a generic Coreboot install.
[21:25:14] <Noisytoot> What blobs does osboot not have that coreboot does?

[21:29:55] <Noisytoot> No, it's a coreboot distro that has just as many blobs as coreboot on the boards that it supports
[21:30:48] <GNUmer> Ah. Still it's a big free software leap to me from an entirely proprietary UEFI system and a proprietary wireless card.

[21:36:26] <GNUmer> craigt: Should Osboot be also included in FSD? It surely has binary blobs for system support, but the codebase is free software. Having it on FSD could get owners of Libreboot-incompatible but Osboot-compatible laptops' owners to switch to a more free BIOS/UEFI system.
[21:36:31] *** Quits: jns (~x@user/jns) (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
[21:38:45] <craigt> GNUmer: That is a good suggestion, but the binary blobs are a barrier to entry. Does it have fully free version?
[21:39:30] <GNUmer> Osboot is a Libreboot fork and Libreboot is already in the FSD.
[21:40:49] <Noisytoot> GNUmer, If it has binary blobs, it's not free, and so can't be included in the FSD
[21:44:48] <GNUmer> Anyways, Osboot is not getting into the FSD. Could the Taisei Project (https://taisei-project.org/) get into the FSD? It's a Touhou clone with the code released under The 2-Clause BSD License and the artwork is licensed under Creative Commons
