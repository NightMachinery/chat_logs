[16:12:01] <cadmio> so the Ker Psi_a is composed by those function which are mapped to f(a) = 0 since 'a' is algebraic
[16:12:39] <Pollion> well, the fact that a is algebraic or not has no purpose in the definition of this map, nor this kernel.
[16:12:51] <Pollion> If a is not algebraic, do you see what is the kernel of this map ?
[16:14:40] <cadmio> those f(x) such that f(a) = 0
[16:15:05] <Pollion> Yes, this is the definition, but what is *concretely* this kernel when a is not algebraic ?
[16:15:05] <cadmio> here we're under the assumption that 'a' is algebraic over F
[16:15:40] <Pollion> I was just commenting about your "since 'a' is algebraic"
[16:16:03] <cadmio> it'd be {f(x) = 0 only} since there's no 'a' algebraic
[16:16:21] <Pollion> ?

[20:32:17] <somiaj> Give a random intger, its prime factorization may have more than two primes.
[20:32:34] <vqueiroz> In this case, it's surely two primes.
[20:32:37] <somiaj> If you want a number X = p*q where p and q are prime. What you do is pick two prime numbers and multiply them together, no factorization there
[20:32:49] <somiaj> So the only way to do that is to pick two prime numbers and multiply them together

[20:34:44] <vqueiroz> Btw, q is sure to be lower than p. Does that help with anything? The truth is, the current algorithm is not going very well on mobile devices.
[20:34:57] <somiaj> though if this is for something like RSA, they use a random database of primes

[21:04:17] <biberao> hi
[21:04:37] <kamil> it is not factoring, it is checking if they can be factored
[21:04:53] <vqueiroz> MTProto requires you to find pq to continue the auth process. it's described here >> https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/auth_key
[21:04:59] <kamil> if it can be factored it is not prime
[21:05:38] <vqueiroz> "Here, string pq is a representation of a natural number (in binary big endian format). This number is the product of two different odd prime numbers. Normally, pq is less than or equal to 2^63-1."
[21:05:50] <vqueiroz> Proof of Work: Client decomposes pq into prime factors such that p < q.
[21:06:18] <vqueiroz> "odd prime numbers" maybe this makes everything easier now? :(
[21:06:31] <somiaj> well the only prime number that isn't odd is 2

[22:00:50] <Galois> yes, freenode is absolutely the wrong approach. How do you even get on freenode these days?
[22:01:08] <[itchyjunk]> Same as always, with an irc client.

[22:02:56] <Galois> no it wasn't
[22:03:01] <[itchyjunk]> yes, it was.
