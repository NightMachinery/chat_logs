[02:47:35] <cosimone> i expected apt install --install-suggests --reinstall <package>, where <package> is a package that is currently installed, to also install suggested packages, but this did not happen
[02:47:54] <cosimone> when i removed the package and ran the command again, suggested packages were installed, as expected

[12:16:58] <meandrain> Hi. I have a debian machine with latest kernel (5.14) and few docker instances. From time to time the debian host freezes. It is a remote machine, I cannot ssh or ping it. It looks dead. Only a hard reset will make it work again. And I said it looks dead because after reset one instance report it was stopped few seconds ago, even if the machine is not accessible for hours.

[12:19:02] <meandrain> Is there a way to see if the network interfaces were renamed? Could this be an issue that will disable rebooting the machine (sending automatic hardware reset will not reset the machine).

[12:21:23] <Cool_Fire> You should be able to tell by the logs after it comes back if it was really hung or just unreachable. (cron jobs and other regular log event generating stuff would still be in there if it's still running but not reachable)
[12:21:43] <Cool_Fire> If it really does hang, maybe try enabling crashdumps
[12:24:38] <meandrain> is there a way to find out if network interfaces were renamed ?

[12:25:06] <Cool_Fire> I think that sort of thing generates a syslog/dmesg event?
[12:25:32] <Cool_Fire> But I'm not sure. I've never had to deal with spontaneously renaming network interfaces
[12:27:57] <Cool_Fire> In fact, I don't think I've ever heard of that happening during runtime at all. But maybe if the network interface crashes and then recovers the OS could see it as a new interface? I'm just wildly speculating at this point.
[12:28:29] <meandrain> It seems I don't have cron logs for the downtime period.
[12:28:40] <meandrain> I'll try your suggestion enabling crashdumps
[12:35:37] <Khepra> meandrain: everything is in the journal. check with journalctl. iface renaming is also logged via kernel facility.
[12:36:01] <meandrain> thank you guys
[12:36:07] <Khepra> and iface renaming is certainly going on unless you configured it not to, and unless there are specific NICs that udev can't determine a name for, so ethX remains

[12:36:47] <meandrain> at this point I think the system just freezed because I can't see logs from yesterday

[12:37:54] <Khepra> meandrain: by default, unless you installed bullseye from scratch, journald is not persistent. you might wish to make it persistent, or if theres syslog forwarding (which is default too), there should be logs in /var/log
[12:38:29] <meandrain> yes, I've found logs, so the problem is system freezing after all
[12:38:40] <meandrain> not network interface renaming
[12:39:02] <meandrain> those are there, the renaming of interfaces but are specific to docker instances, not the main / public IP interface
[12:39:02] <Khepra> is it configured not to rename?
[12:39:15] <meandrain> no

[12:42:06] <Khepra> Cool_Fire: that's right.
[12:42:19] <Khepra> meandrain: so that's renamed to enp35s0
[12:42:29] <Khepra> did you not mean this as "renaming"?
[12:42:38] <meandrain> Cool_Fire: I see some renaming in logs, because of docker (but not to enp35s0, to others)

[12:45:13] <Khepra> when one says "network interface renaming" if vastly most, if not all cases, it (should) means ethX -> "predictable" renaming by udev on boot

[12:45:18] *** Joins: chipox (~chipox@185.225.28.152)
[12:45:46] <Intimidated> i've never understood the need for that change. eth0 was always predictable for me
[12:46:16] <Khepra> right, and if there are no logs about the freezing context, which'd be logs just prior to reboot, it could mean two things:  1) kernel module issue so a hard panic ensued,  2) hardware problems so the cpu entered an impossible state
[12:46:26] <meandrain> I'll try to record a crash dump. But if the system freezes without any dump, I don't know how to solve this.
[12:46:28] <Khepra> Intimidated: did you ever use a system with more than one NIC and a crappy BIOS?
[12:47:03] <meandrain> 1) how can I find the panic in logs ?
[12:47:16] <Khepra> "which'd be logs just prior to reboot"
[12:47:31] <meandrain> I tried:  journalctl -b -1  -p "emerg".."crit". and nothing is there
[12:47:36] <Khepra> ideally use persistent journald, so you can check things like .... that yes.
[12:47:51] <meandrain> I see, I'll configure persistent journald
[12:47:53] <Khepra> no need to filter with -p even. just read last -n 100 or whatever, logs for -b -1
[12:48:10] <Intimidated> Khepra: Certainly more than one NIC
[12:48:16] <Intimidated> but i guess not a crappy bios..
[12:48:28] <Intimidated> so the bios wasn't presenting them in a predictable order?
[12:48:43] <Khepra> meandrain: Storage=persistent in /etc/systemd/journald.conf . There's other ways, implicit with pre-creating dirs in /var/log but that's dumb, not obvious, I hate implicit things

[12:49:18] <Khepra> Intimidated: yeah that's the problem. Personally I'd agree, the whole "predictable" crap never solved the issue and just created more unpredictability, there's bugs (still open) where removing a GPU will rename the NICS.....
[12:49:56] <Intimidated> lol wat
[12:50:05] <Khepra> I always, even today, configure binding MAC addr with iface name and that has so far worked in 100% of cases. Ye, I know there's NICs so crappy that they randomly change MACs, but ... at least this way eth0 will always be eitehr the same NIC or nothing at all

[12:53:06] *** Joins: LucaTM (~LucaTM@user/lucatm)
[12:53:23] <Khepra> the deal with that is to get the dump out asap. logging to disk goes through very slow process via filesystem and the bus, and the hard drives, and there may be situations where the kernel did output an error but that was cut off mid-way to the drives, or the commit on the filesystem was not done.
[12:54:59] <Khepra> ultimately if you get no logs at all, I'd reseat all SATA cables, and all PCIe hardware; and start with testing out RAM. Then if no problem was found, I'd replace the PSU just in case.
[12:55:28] <meandrain> the problem is that I don't have access to the machine
[12:55:59] <Khepra> this has, so far, for me, in many years, solved 100% of situations where a machine would hard-reboot, no logs no complaints nothing whatsoever. Reseating, faulty RAM or faulty PSU.
[12:56:09] <meandrain> https://dpaste.org/PF7U    is anything wrong here?  https://dpaste.org/PF7U
[12:57:33] <meandrain> the machine is an AMD Ryzen 9 3900 12-Core Processor

[15:26:04] <Khepra> my ISP is forcing their modem/router thingy too, but I put a debian firewall thingy right behind it, so it doesn't matter

[21:07:58] <Khepra> yeah no subdirs unless you explicitely do an "include"
[21:08:02] <dob1> Khepra, but the nginx logrotate script will have to run it, it has run-parts /etc/logrotate.d/httpd-prerotate
[21:08:14] <dob1> or am I wrong?
[21:08:31] <Khepra> not sure what you're talking about. nginx installs a single _config_ file into logrotate.d
[21:09:26] <dob1> Khepra, right, if you look at the script installed by nginx there is an hook for prerotate, it will run scripts in that dir imho
[21:09:27] <Khepra> ooooh, I see... someone made a mistake. that's.... no place for scripts at all due to default include, and httpd-prerotate isn't even default
[21:09:42] <Khepra> dob1: that's a mistake

[23:11:19] <grobi> are the packaged browser unsecure for real? https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/phoronix/latest-phoronix-articles/1295133-the-sad-state-of-web-browser-support-currently-within-debian
[23:11:50] <beastwick> there is always an article ridiculing debian's packaged browsers
[23:11:53] <sney> that article is correct except for the stated reasons that firefox-esr is delayed
[23:12:38] <sney> but even if debian was 100% on top of browser updates all the time, browsers would still have the CVE high score as well as undetected security issues, because that's how browsers be
[23:13:16] <beastwick> grobi sney is right, and you have to understand that you are using a browser that has to be patched by the security team and it is a gigantic undertaking being a browser
[23:13:22] <somiaj> chormium is in a bad state right now due to lack of people to maintain it. https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=995212
[23:13:24] <judd> Bug https://bugs.debian.org/995212 in chromium (open): ¬´chromium: Update to version 94.0.4606.61 (security-fixes)¬ª; severity: normal; opened: 2021-09-27; last modified: 2021-09-27.
[23:13:41] <beastwick> i recommend getting firefox directly from mozilla and dropping into /opt
[23:13:50] <sney> flatpak is a good approach for getting current browsers in debian stable, or just use the firefox tarball
[23:13:50] <somiaj> firefox-esr isn't to bad, its biggest issue is being able to build it using stable tools, which it currently cannot be done due to needing a newer version of rust.
[23:14:59] <somiaj> I do suspect firefox-esr to get resolved. But unless skilled volunteers who come out of the woodwork and know chromium step up, chromium might just be dropped from debian and you'll hvae to use google-chrome (it is currently dropped from bookworm and might not make it into the next release)
[23:15:04] <grobi> ok thank you all for suggestions

[23:17:58] <beastwick> grobi: that's what I do ;)
[23:18:03] <somiaj> there are also some firefox-esr bugs talking about what needs done to get the new esr into stable
[23:18:17] <grobi> beastwick: thanks
[23:18:26] <somiaj> grobi: I run it from $HOME personally. You'll want your user to own the files anyways for auto-updates
[23:18:38] <Khepra> that's actually terrible idea
[23:18:51] <Khepra> programs should never have the ability to change their own code. that's like one of major infection vectors.
[23:19:20] <Khepra> back in the 90s, we used that as one of heuristics for viruses/malware.
[23:19:40] <somiaj> well dpkg can change its own code...*hides*

[23:20:47] <somiaj> Yea, I would prefer to have firefox-esr in stable, but for the time, I've opted to using this method to keep it up to date....basically browsers suck and it sucks we need them as a fundamental part of an desktop OS
[23:21:06] <Khepra> I just packaged esr with a ton of security atop of it. like a boss.
[23:21:13] <Khepra> I just *use
[23:21:49] <grobi> :)
[23:22:23] <somiaj> I've been thinking of maybe going that route with ungoogled-chromium, but I've finally switched back to firefox, chromium isn't the browser I originally started using.
[23:22:56] <beastwick> is chromium verifiably ungoogled?

[23:29:40] <tesseract> Khepra: you can set it yourself
[23:29:45] <tesseract> with flatseal app
[23:29:53] <tesseract> i set it to use wayland
[23:29:58] <Khepra> k
[23:30:00] <tesseract> by default it uses x11
[23:30:32] <Khepra> but flatpak has no security boundaries, as it requires selinux for that. I'd rather use snap with apparmor
[23:31:00] <Khepra> flatpak is fedora/RHEL tech. snaps are at least born in the world based on debian
[23:31:48] <tesseract> flatpak seemed easier for me because of flatseal app that i can set its restrictions etc..
[23:31:55] <tesseract> sanbox
[23:32:20] <Khepra> those aren't proper security boundaries tho
[23:32:27] <tesseract> firefox can only access to downloads directory by default
[23:32:47] <tesseract> Khepra: what is security boundaries?
[23:33:37] <tesseract> afk
[23:34:26] <Khepra> tesseract: mandatory access control and syscall audit. flatpak requires (and uses in Fedora/RHEL land) selinux. snapd uses Apparmor on ubuntu and debian.

[23:54:29] <Khepra> they're only "pushed" in Ubuntu, but still quite optional. And the reason is simple. Canonical wants as much vendors as possible to embrace the format, thus cutting out the maintainership burden.

[23:55:36] <Khepra> well with the exception of firefox and chromium in ubuntu, those are non-optional snaps. if you apt install them, the deb just pulls in the snap. I think the browser situation in debian is very much an example of why that's happening
[23:56:16] <beastwick> wow, do you think debian will actually default to a snap for just browsers?
[23:56:27] <beastwick> would* in the future?
[23:58:27] <Khepra> that's the most sensible solution.
