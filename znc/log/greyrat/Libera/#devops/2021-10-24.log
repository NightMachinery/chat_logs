[00:20:08] <kwilczynski> Dus10: Why are you juniors leaving?
[00:22:43] <kwilczynski> I see this is a wider problem as per what kubblai  said too...
[00:22:48] <kwilczynski> People retention.
[00:23:16] <kwilczynski> Dus10: What does your company do?
[00:35:29] <rawtaz> if i may be cynical, one cause of that problem is that juniors nowadays are so incredibly unskilled and clueless, that when they learn a bunch of things that to those who have more of a nerd background are basics, they feel theyre so incredibly more competent and should be worth more on the market, so they leave. lol :P

[01:59:56] <kwilczynski> rawtaz: You might be onto something here.
[02:00:23] <kwilczynski> I started noticing "senior" CVs with only 2-3 years if experience.
[02:00:28] <rawtaz> yeah
[02:00:41] <rawtaz> the it industry has changed quite a bit
[02:00:54] <kwilczynski> And... A lot of universities have programmers/courses reaching students how to pass Google interviews.
[02:01:27] <kwilczynski> Then, when you speak with people like that they have often very little idea how things work.
[02:02:18] <kwilczynski> Inability to troubleshoot is also concerning.
[02:03:37] <kwilczynski> Businesses seem to also been complaining that there "aren't any people to hire" :)
[02:04:10] <rawtaz> yep
[02:04:49] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: we should claim a planet of our own and set things up properly
[02:05:23] <kwilczynski> Haha
[02:05:37] <kwilczynski> Tempting.
[02:06:05] <rawtaz> :>
[02:06:34] <kwilczynski> The recent explosion of COVID cases in Poland is a rude reminder that people are ... sadly had to be name for what it is... dump.
[02:06:58] <kwilczynski> The things I've heard from anti-vaccine people and such...
[02:07:03] <kwilczynski> I don't even...
[02:07:34] <kwilczynski> We are doomed as species.
[02:07:41] <kwilczynski> Me thinks.
[02:09:35] <kwilczynski> :/
[02:10:23] <rawtaz> i agree completely :)
[02:10:35] <rawtaz> it's horrible. people are so *incredibly* stupid. (not everyone of course)
[02:12:43] <kwilczynski> No, not everyone. Thankfully 
[02:12:47] <rawtaz> haha, this is pretty fantastic too. apparently there's no way with influxdb to host it on e.g. /influxdb or similar, since theres a  <base href="/">  hardcoded into the web gui. the only way to change that is to rebuild influxdb.
[02:12:51] <rawtaz> https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/15721
[02:13:02] <kwilczynski> LOL
[02:13:25] <rawtaz> the issue has been around since i dont know when. i might be mistaken but i cant imagine that it would be anything but pretty straight forward for influx to support a parameter or setting for this
[02:13:59] * rawtaz is still trying to decide between influxdb 2 web gui and grafana
[02:17:36] <kwilczynski> I stopped using Influx around the time they decided that v1 is poo and v2 is the hot thing... and come buy our cloud.
[02:17:53] <kwilczynski> And the Influx Cloud is a total garbage.
[02:19:10] <rawtaz> but influxdb 2 and flux and the new gui is looking really great
[02:19:32] <rawtaz> and the telegraf integration where telegrafs can get their config from a central influxdb, thats fricken kick-ass
[02:19:36] <rawtaz> (just need a token)
[02:20:44] <kwilczynski> TimescaleDB or Clickhouse here from now on :)
[02:20:50] <rawtaz> damn you!
[02:21:05] * rawtaz goes to learn about those new things he never heard of before
[02:21:34] <rawtaz> i get the first one but hte second one sounds like some porn site for people with mice fetish
[02:21:45] * rawtaz eyes kwilczynski suspiciously
[02:22:23] <kwilczynski> Haha
[02:22:28] <kwilczynski> It's a thing.
[02:22:40] <kwilczynski> Very decent database.

[02:35:35] <rawtaz> kwilczynski: is this the clickhouse youre talking about? https://clickhouse.com
[02:35:48] <rawtaz> looks like a query interface. it's not something you replaced e.g. grafana with i suppose?

[02:37:15] <kwilczynski> This one.
[02:37:30] <kwilczynski> No, definitely not a replacement.
[02:38:09] <rawtaz> same one. right, i dont remember but are you using grafana or whats your monitoring stack?

[05:02:56] <zacts> hi #devops
[05:03:02] <rawtaz> lo
[05:08:48] <zacts> what is a good programming language to learn for DevOps?
[05:09:51] <rawtaz> python would probably be a good choice for that
[05:10:04] <rawtaz> of course bash scripting as well, scripting in general
[05:10:20] <rawtaz> its not like as a devops engineer you are supposed to write *code* as a programmer
[05:10:45] <zacts> so would you be doing sysadmin scripting with python?
[05:10:54] <zacts> or why python versus other languages?
[05:11:23] <rawtaz> its just one language that is somewhat common in these contexts you ask about
[05:11:29] <zacts> is python a good choice due to the system scripting features it offers versus say javascript for app development?
[05:12:04] <rawtaz> i dont understand the question. how is js and app development relevant or even comparable?
[05:12:13] <zacts> sorry I didn't phrase that well.
[05:12:32] <rawtaz> btw, you do understand that just because you e.g. learn a programming language it doesnt make you a devops person?
[05:14:30] <zacts> is python a more suitable language to learn for DevOps than javascript?
[05:15:04] <rawtaz> i would say yes to that
[05:15:07] <zacts> thanks
[05:15:24] <zacts> rawtaz: "btw, you do understand that just because..." what do you mean by that?
[05:15:49] <rawtaz> i mean that just because you learn python, it doesnt get you a job in devops. you dont become someone who can do devops just because you learn python
[05:17:08] <zacts> rawtaz: I'm currently learning kubernetes a bit.
[05:17:48] <zacts> I'm just looking at all of the skills I need to become more proficient at DevOps. =).
[05:18:35] <zacts> but, indeed, I am a beginner.
[05:18:36] <rawtaz> zacts: you have a lot to learn ;)  see https://roadmap.sh/devops
[05:19:08] <zacts> thanks
[05:19:49] <rawtaz> yw
