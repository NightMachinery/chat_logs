[00:02:01] <alphamule2> Or writing on sides or whatever
[00:02:46] <z6np-6w> thats too hard! *moves slider back to EASY*
[00:02:51] <alphamule2> The obvious methods
[00:03:25] <alphamule2> I believe the inspiration for them came from magic squares.
[00:03:50] <alphamule2> If you have a 3x3x3x3 square...
[00:03:51] <z6np-6w> you need that mathologer guy ja?
[00:03:58] <alphamule2> That is, 9 boxes of 9 cells..
[00:04:16] <alphamule2> Then you start with some random order in one box.
[00:04:28] <alphamule2> And try to find all the possible arrangements for the others
[00:04:47] <alphamule2> This is a vexing problem to do by hand I'd bet :P
[00:05:26] <alphamule2> By the time you did it for one set, you'd find a way to represent all the solutions.
[00:05:42] <alphamule2> Then throw a program at it.  heh
[00:05:58] <nimaje> translating these constraints to a boolean formula and let a SAT solver find solutions is really easy and allowing a (n^2)*(n^2) sudoku variant is also easy

[00:15:34] <alphamule2> There's some nasty ones that have about 1000 cells
[00:15:40] <alphamule2> Well, before they add the gaps
[00:15:43] <river> so sudoku is pretty fun to think about
[00:15:48] <river> it's a 3x3x3x3 grid in a sense
[00:15:58] <river> but the constraints are not completely symmetric
[00:16:09] <alphamule2> You can represent it as 3x3x3x3 yes
[00:16:17] <river> they have fewer constraints than the full 4d set would naturally have, just to make the puzzle make sense as layed out flat
[00:16:26] <river> another very fun thing about sudoku is automorphisms
[00:16:28] <alphamule2> It also acts kind of like a bunch of snakes
[00:16:40] <alphamule2> All the permutation snakes you can stand

[00:16:47] <river> i just recently watched this

[00:16:49] <river> best explanation ive seen
[00:17:12] <alphamule2> YT not working on VNC.  Oh well.
[00:17:28] <river> there's all these possible automorphisms of sudoku grids - which forms a group, and they look for sudokus which have the largest number of these automorphisms
[00:17:33] <river> and in fact there is a unique winner
[00:17:37] <river> (up to automorphism)
[00:17:59] <river> automorphism can be: flipping the thing, relabelling numbers, permutations of cols, rows, boxes, etc..

[03:35:30] <brownorange> as the liar sentence is usually built using math, not some meta-level construct.

[03:38:52] <int-e> Assuming PA (or S extending PA) is consistent, G is true in a standard model of PA as you get from ZF (with the natural numbers = the smallest set containing 0 and all its successors), for example.
[03:39:13] <dude12312414> yeah i've seen too many people use G as an example of a statement that "humans somehow know to be true but unprovable by machines" and use it as proof that humans are somehow superior than machines
[03:39:54] <joel135> like penrose
[03:39:58] <int-e> But it's really more of a distraction than actually helpful. It ties into the intuitive connection between the encoding of provability and provability.
[03:40:23] <blei> but we find another instance of of G in Kolmogorov Information Theory (Algorithmic Information Theory), where it is shown that, for complex datasets (ie reality), if you had an optimal compression, you could not show it.

[04:21:06] <dude12312414> like sqrt(x - 2) = 6 - x implies 6 - x >= 0

[08:08:36] <hoppity> Hi guys, if I have a right triangle with adjacent side of length 5 and opposite side of length 5 as well, the hypotenuse is of length 7.07. If I divide 5/7.07 I get 0.707 which is the ration of any of the sides in relation to the hypotenuse. How can two sides have the same ratio and not add to 1?
[08:09:29] <hoppity> I would have assumed that each of the sides (adjacent and opposite) would have had 0.5 ratio in relation to the hypotenuse.
[08:10:19] <int-e> Why would you assume that?
[08:10:55] <pokhu> thats because 5 + 5 =/= 5 root 2
[08:11:14] <int-e> if the ratios are x and y, then x^2 + y^2 = 1; if they are also equal, then you get x^2 = y^2 = 1/2, so the ratio is 1/sqrt(2) ~ 0.707
[08:11:27] <pokhu> youre thinking of triangles all lying on the same line, a degenerate triangle
[08:11:45] <hoppity> that makes sense
[08:12:02] <hoppity> the " 5 + 5 =/= 5 root 2" part
[08:12:16] <int-e> (x^2 + y^2 = 1 is s special case of Pythagoras' theorem)
[08:12:16] <hoppity> pokhu: what do you mean by a degenerate triangle
[08:12:33] <pokhu> i mean if the third line is also on the other 2 lines
[08:12:37] <pokhu> if one of the angles is 0
[08:12:56] <hoppity> I was trying to calculate how much each side "contributes" onto the hypotenuse's length
[08:12:58] <hoppity> if that makes sense
[08:13:05] <pokhu> yeah
[08:13:17] <Galois> it's _always_ going to be a longer distance around the two legs of the triangle than straight across the hypotenuse, unless the triangle has zero area
[08:13:36] <Galois> the _only_ way each leg could be 0.5 times the hypotenuse is if the triangle has zero area

[08:14:29] <hoppity> is it possible to calculate each side's "contribution" onto the length of the hypotenuse in such a way that you would get, let's say:  0.3 for adjacent and 0.7 for opposite?

[08:15:44] <pokhu> yeah thats what sin is for. sin and cos add up to 1, its just that you cant have a linear combination because its 2 dimensional
[08:16:06] <pokhu> i mean sin and cos add up to 1 after squaring
[08:16:34] <pokhu> i guess you could just use the squared values
[08:18:05] <hoppity> 5/7.07 = 0.707

[08:18:48] <hoppity> interesting how squaring sine and cosine you can add up to one, but why is that?

[08:21:19] <pokhu> they are ratios from the sides to the hypotenuse, but the sum of the sides will always be greater than the hypotenuse

[09:43:09] <widp> how do 'compute gradients' and 'apply gradients' work in tensorflow?
[09:43:30] <widp> I am having a hard time understanding back propagation I think
[09:44:02] <widp> why are gradients computed with respect to variables (which I assume are the parameters to a function which is being approximated)?
[09:44:21] <energizer> perhaps look into autograd
[09:44:36] <greenbagels> so what are gradients in a tensorflow context
[09:44:43] <energizer> i dont know tensorflow so that's just a guess
[09:44:55] <greenbagels> these ML types always use math terms to refer to random different things so i can never know what to expect
[09:45:11] <energizer> automatic differentiation
[09:45:15] <greenbagels> (as if math vocab isnt already overloaded enough)
[09:46:16] <greenbagels> energizer: so then it's the same use of the word, ok
[09:46:45] <MsPoop> greenbagels: are you relatively new to math?

[11:45:21] <river> hello
[11:45:59] <river> how can I relabel the sides of two dices (they may have 4 sides, 6 sides, 8 sides, 12 sides etc.) to create an even probability distribution when I roll them both and add the numbers?
[11:46:23] *** Joins: rindolf (~shlomif@inkscape/dev/shlomif)
[11:46:23] <river> in particular how can I produce an even distribution of a prime number of numbers [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] for example
[11:47:12] <river> using dice generating functions and grouping factorizations you can find even distributions like this https://fulmicoton.com/posts/dices/ but i think these resulting sets always have a composite number of values (36 in this post)
