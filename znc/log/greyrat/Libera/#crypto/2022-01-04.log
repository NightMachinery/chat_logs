[05:31:24] <TimMc> I've been struggling with how to manage key rotation in the social protocol I've been putting together.
[05:33:05] <TimMc> I think it has roughly the same problem Signal has, in that there's both a locator identity (a phone number for Signal, a URL for my protocol) and a cryptographic identity (public keys, in both cases). Either one can change, and if either identity remains constant it can vouch for the other one.
[05:34:39] <TimMc> (The protocol I'm working on goes by the name of "Cavern" for now: https://gitlab.com/timmc/cavern)
[05:36:28] *** Joins: rardiol (~quassel@user/rardiol)
[05:37:10] <TimMc> When someone changes the URL of their journal, it's easy enough to have the key sign a record saying "hey, this move happened". And if someone needs to rotate their key, they can sign that rotation record with both old and new keys.
[05:38:10] <TimMc> I think that I'm fine with having the client accept either of those immediately, if the signatures check out, and notify the user just as a heads-up. Maybe users with higher security needs would want an "is this OK" dialog box first.
[05:39:19] <TimMc> But... let's say someone's journal gets hacked, and the attacker both redirects the journal to a new URL (changes the location identity) and rotates the key. How does the rightful owner retake control? :-
[05:39:23] <TimMc> :-/
[05:40:41] <TimMc> One thing that might help: I'm building in a gossip protocol so that key/URL combinations are offered to friends-of-friends, and that might be usable for move-revocations, forcing people to decide manually between sources of truth...
[05:48:04] <maroon> exactly what is given to the 'friends'?

[05:54:02] <TimMc> So maybe the first time you encounter someone's journal, you already know its public key, and have trust-before-first-use. :-)

[05:56:13] <maroon> if the stranger hacks your friend's journal do they get it from them?
[05:57:45] <TimMc> In this scenario does the stranger gain the private key, write access to the journal (which is a pile of encrypted files on an HTTP server), or both?
[05:57:57] <TimMc> ("Both" would be a desktop malware scenario.)
[05:58:21] <TimMc> (I guess "private key" would be too, probably.)
[06:00:06] <TimMc> If Eve gets Alice's private key, Eve can read anything Bob was publishing for Alice. If Eve *also* gains the ability to write to Alice's web host, then Eve could advertise false information about key/URL correspondence.
[06:05:37] <TimMc> If Alice still *has* the private key, she can ask a friend to publish a self-signed "alert, compromised" revocation using the private key, and people could be notified; I guess their journals could immediately stop publishing things for her until they check in out-of-band and ask for the new public key and journal URL.
[06:06:40] <TimMc> I think the best I can do is some combination of "alert if there are conflicting updates" and "allow people to publish alerts on behalf of friends".
[06:08:27] <TimMc> Bob's client: "Alert: Carol claims that Alice's computer was hacked. Please contact Alice in-person, by phone, or via some method *other* than Cavern to confirm what her new key is."
[06:17:58] <TimMc> Hmm. Bob's client can keep checking the old URL for a while in case a conflicting revocation shows up a week later. :-)

[17:53:24] <WilsonLevi> am sharing some Crypto Tokens / User Points on https://thewiki.in/network to start the exchange of these tokens ... are you interested?
[17:53:35] * Haohmaru points up ^ at the topic
[17:53:54] <WilsonLevi> Hi Haohmaru ...
[17:54:15] <WilsonLevi> would you like to try it out?

[17:54:34] <Haohmaru> ...the topic
[17:54:48] <Haohmaru> /topic #crypto
[17:54:53] <WilsonLevi> topic can be anything ...
[17:55:04] <riv> we hate bitcoin
[17:55:04] <Haohmaru> it's a very particular something
[17:55:17] <WilsonLevi> Its not based on blockchain riv
[17:55:23] <riv> dont care
[17:55:45] <WilsonLevi> okay riv sorry to hurt your sentiments
[17:55:49] <Haohmaru> craptocurrencies are especially mentioned in the topic

[17:56:24] <Haohmaru> do i look like interested in crapcoinz?
[17:56:42] <WilsonLevi> I dont know Haohmaru ... sorry if you are not
[17:56:44] <Haohmaru> <angry_samurai.jpg>
[17:56:47] <riv> no one is interesting please dont discuss it here
[17:56:51] <riv> interested*
[17:57:04] <WilsonLevi> so what is this chatroom for?
[17:57:17] <Haohmaru> see the topic, again
[17:57:42] <WilsonLevi> crypto ... so can we talk about SHA256 and md5?
[17:57:49] <Haohmaru> yes
[17:57:57] <Haohmaru> md5 sux, sha256 - gud
[17:58:00] <WilsonLevi> okay, thanks ...
[17:58:09] <riv> yes
[17:58:18] <WilsonLevi> is md5 safe enough to be used for passwords for a website?
[17:58:25] <riv> no
[17:59:11] <Haohmaru> it's fine as long as neither me, nor anyone i know or care about have a password on that site ;P~
[17:59:21] <Haohmaru> altho, maybe even then it's still not fine
[17:59:46] <WilsonLevi> okay ... thanks ...
[18:00:01] <Peng> Passwords should use a password hash function like Argon2
[18:00:10] <Peng> Which are designed to be slow and resource-intensive
[18:00:55] <Haohmaru> if the hash don't make your CPU fans intensify - toss it
[18:01:16] <WilsonLevi> has anyone used elgg software for making a website?
[18:01:25] <WilsonLevi> I wanted to iscuss its security
[18:02:02] <Haohmaru> is that some content-management-system thing?
[18:02:24] <WilsonLevi> yes it is ...
[18:02:35] <WilsonLevi> a content management system ... a social media engine
[18:02:49] <Haohmaru> no idea, but generally, lots of folks suggest going for static site generators
[18:02:59] <Haohmaru> particularly for personal websites

[21:23:50] <kashire> hey
[21:24:13] <CodeSpelunker> is this a good place to ask about diceware?  I've been reading about that recently and had some questions
[21:24:41] <CodeSpelunker> or is that too basic or somethin
[21:24:55] <halosghost> I see no reason why that wouldn't be reasonable to ask about here
[21:25:00] <CodeSpelunker> cool :)
[21:25:33] <CodeSpelunker> to preface, I'm interesting in making a password storage program, which can generate diceware passwords
[21:25:49] <CodeSpelunker> kinda similar to password-store
[21:25:51] <kashire> Someone just shared an amusing image which contains the following text: "it's not a data breach, it's a surprise backup" -- Thought I'd share that.
[21:25:56] <CodeSpelunker> lol
[21:26:33] <CodeSpelunker> so here is my idea: say you have a site which limits the passwords to 30 characters, right?
[21:26:57] *** Quits: kish` (~aqua@user/aqua) (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
[21:27:11] <CodeSpelunker> is there any appreciable difference between picking 5 words, each of 6 letters, 6 of 5 each, a 10 and a 20, etc

[21:28:39] <halosghost> CodeSpelunker: mm, that's an interesting question; to double-check that I understood what you're asking, you're asking if the final length of the passphrase is all that matters rather than the lengths of the words you roll to combine into the final?
[21:28:53] <halosghost> s/lengths/lengths and count/
[21:29:11] <CodeSpelunker> yes, a little bit. for instance, if I pick 10 3 letter words versus two 15 letter words
[21:29:32] <halosghost> I'm sure it does matter from an entropy standpoint, but I'm not sure it'd matter much
[21:29:37] <byteskeptical> count is king
[21:29:47] <CodeSpelunker> and actually, I think it may be a little bit insecure to pick just one length, bc the hacker's life is easier
[21:29:53] <CodeSpelunker> if they know that
[21:30:04] <Bostik> so you would pre-emptively limit your word choices to a subset of known words in diceware?
[21:30:29] <halosghost> in some sense, if the hacker knows any information about what words you picked, they know a fair amount about the “preimage”
[21:30:35] <halosghost> s/hacker/attacker/
[21:31:13] <Alipha> CodeSpelunker: the length doesn't directly matter. what matters is the number of words in your dictionary, which would likely decrease with shorter words. however, the more important aspect is to have more words, so "6 of 5 each" is likely to be more secure than "3 of 10 each"
[21:31:31] <CodeSpelunker> so then, my question is: what's a good algorithm to maximize that available length (30 in the example)?
[21:31:48] <halosghost> my version of diceware is usually `shuf /usr/share/words/dict | head -#` (where # is the count of words I want)
[21:32:13] <CodeSpelunker> Alipha: makes intuitive sense :)
[21:32:19] <byteskeptical> halosghost: yes but past a certain length this becomes the a non factor
[21:32:50] <kashire> byteskeptical: Unless the malicious actor knows the software that you use to generate your passwords. 
[21:32:52] <halosghost> byteskeptical: indeed
[21:32:58] <kashire> More words would be more secure in that case.
[21:33:06] <byteskeptical> kashire: not really
[21:33:23] <byteskeptical> unless there is an error in the generation itself in the program you use it shouldn't matter
[21:33:56] <ioxzev1z> CodeSpelunker, The EFF dice list is better than diceware. For example it doesn't contain words that can become one, e.g. "in" and "put" can become "input" in diceware, but the EFF list protects against that
[21:34:07] <CodeSpelunker> the risk I see in having as many words as possible, is that frequency in language tends to go up and word length decreases
[21:34:07] <Alipha> CodeSpelunker: i would have a dictionary of all words of all length, and then just keep randomly adding words until you reach the limit (or get close to it, e.g., a length of 27 would be okay). so you might randomly pick a 5 letter word, then 8 letter, then 4, then 10 letter or something
[21:34:07] <byteskeptical> kashire: it is, longer passwords are harder to break on a non-linear curve
[21:34:22] <CodeSpelunker> Alipha: that was my idea as well
[21:34:35] <kashire> byteskeptical: I'm referring to a different issue. Generally, 30-characters is just 30-characters.
[21:35:29] <CodeSpelunker> but then, I'm also trying to consider having some minimum password length too, and trying to think of how the logic would work if it is impossible to fulfill the constraints with the current accumulation and dictionary
[21:35:35] <CodeSpelunker> if that makes sense
[21:35:50] <ioxzev1z> CodeSpelunker, generate X words then truncate at 30 characters
[21:36:01] <CodeSpelunker> that's a neat idea too
[21:36:21] <ioxzev1z> "fat" and "cat" would be "fatca" if you're stuck with 5 chars, etc
[21:36:24] <byteskeptical> just alias openssl rand -base64 {length arguement}

[21:37:27] <CodeSpelunker> for convenience
[21:37:44] <halosghost> Alipha: or O if your in some circles
[21:37:57] <CodeSpelunker> the idea is, it makes reading off from the repository easy, when it's time to manually enter
[21:37:58] <byteskeptical> Bostik: that works as well
[21:37:59] <kashire> echo "username:website:masterpass" | sha512sum
[21:38:50] <Bostik> byteskeptical: and has been my password generator of choice for the past 20+ years :)
[21:39:03] <CodeSpelunker> ioxzev1z: thanks for the heads up btw, I will likely use that list instead
[21:39:12] <halosghost> I'm somewhat skeptical of its validity, but I do like fastrandom (tl;dr: get enough random bytes from urandom to create a solid key for AES encryption, and then AES-encrypt /dev/zero, throwing away the key
[21:39:14] <kashire> Bostik: I use password-store, I think they do the same thing.
[21:39:15] <halosghost> )
[21:39:35] <halosghost> incredibly fast practically random bytes
[21:39:43] <halosghost> again, not sure how much that should be relied upon
[21:39:45] <CodeSpelunker> I haven't worried about how I'm going to encrypt it yet haha
[21:39:49] <kashire> Oh wait, its not base but thats generally it.
[21:39:56] <CodeSpelunker> that feels like the easier part
[21:40:41] <halosghost> CodeSpelunker: that's not an encryption plan, that's a (hopefully) secure, very fast, random bytes plan
[21:41:07] <CodeSpelunker> oh I see
[21:41:19] <CodeSpelunker> yeah, for the random password generation part.  You're right
[21:41:45] <halosghost> well, it's not actually all that helpful for password generation because, for the most part, urandom is likely to be fast enough
[21:42:03] <halosghost> it's helpful for when you want a ton of random bytes

[21:42:11] <halosghost> (and again, I'm unsure of its security properties)
[21:42:46] <Bostik> kashire: I'd think pretty much any sane password manager does that - they may use a different symbol dictionary depending on what rules the final output conforms to but encoding raw data from urandom (or any OS-provided CSPRNG) is the norm
[21:42:48] <byteskeptical> halosghost: /dev/urandom is enough
[21:43:07] <kashire> Bostik: Its a good method :)
[21:43:19] <Bostik> aye :)
[21:43:46] <halosghost> byteskeptical: there have been times where I've found it not fast enough

[21:45:04] <byteskeptical> halosghost: that's hard to believe but maybe your doing some crazy low level things
[21:45:47] <halosghost> one of the primary times I've found it helpful is when I'm shredding a drive
[21:46:11] <CodeSpelunker> I was about to mention lol
[21:46:21] <CodeSpelunker> overwriting a drive with random data
[21:46:26] <halosghost> (when I need ~1TB of random data)
[21:46:31] <CodeSpelunker> you want it to be fast...but also very random
[21:46:53] <byteskeptical> i doubt that was the bottleneck urandom will generate much faster than you can write to even an ssd
[21:47:02] <CodeSpelunker> I like to precompute my terabytes of random data ahead and freeze them, a la Martha Stewart
[21:47:05] <halosghost> these days, the only time I do that is in-preparation for FDE, after which I can just trash the LUKS header (which is much smaller) and I effectively get the same amount of randomness in the rest of the drive
[21:48:13] <CodeSpelunker> this seems like a fun channel :D always glad to find places like here on IRC still
[21:48:19] <byteskeptical> especially if your using hardware accelerated AES

[21:53:29] <halosghost> byteskeptical: for comparison: I get about 90MiB/s of data from /dev/urandom; I get about 1GiB/s from fastrandom
[21:54:20] <halosghost> using this: openssl enc -aes-256-ctr -pbkdf2 -pass pass:"$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=256 count=1 2>/dev/null | base64)" -nosalt < /dev/zero
[21:55:01] <halosghost> it definitely makes a difference when you're trying to fill a large HDD ☺

[21:56:44] <kashire> halosghost: urandom should speed up after the new kernel hits other distros. 
[21:57:05] <kashire> 5.16-rc8 is out now. I just don't know anyone who is running it yet.
[21:57:06] <halosghost> with the blake2 rng, you mean?
[21:57:08] <kashire> yeah
[21:57:27] <halosghost> I'm not running it yet either, but I still suspect it won't be close to the above performance
[21:57:59] <halosghost> perhaps I'm wrong on that (that'd be cool!)
[21:58:10] <kashire> halosghost: You are probably right about that, but I hope you are wrong. I'd love to see urandom actually be useful.
[21:58:39] <kashire> Have you tried arc4? OpenBSD uses that, I know its faster, but I don't know by how much.
[21:58:39] <Platonides> reading from /dev/urandom needs a context switch, whereas openssl enc doesn't
[21:58:59] <Platonides> so when measuring, it is expected that openssl will be able to be faster
[21:59:33] <Platonides> when writing to a HDD, perhaps /dev/urandom would be able to do some page-copying tricks, though
[21:59:34] <halosghost> Platonides: shouldn't that amortize over the runtime?
[22:00:03] <halosghost> or is it expected for reading from /dev/urandom to remain slow for the entire time you're reading from it?
[22:00:33] <Platonides> halosghost: you will need to enter and exit the kernel per each read
[22:00:39] <halosghost> mmm
[22:00:50] <Platonides> obviously, it's better that you use big blocks, both for urandom and the disk
[22:00:58] <halosghost> that's definitely a bit of an unfair comparison then
[22:00:59] <Platonides> but it seems like an added cost
[22:01:22] <halosghost> though, comparison being unfair or not, the result is that I can generate a ton of (again, hopefully) secure random bytes using the above method
[22:06:37] *** Quits: rardiol (~quassel@user/rardiol) (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[22:08:22] <ericonr> Platonides: you also need to enter and exit the kernel for every write; I'd expect writes to take longer inside the kernel than read
[22:08:54] <Platonides> ericonr: you have those as well with openssl
[22:09:11] <Platonides> what I don't know is if with urandom it could use DMA
[22:09:34] <ericonr> yup, that's my point :p openssl is only saving on reads, both have the write cost
[22:10:14] <Platonides> it's drawish in that
[22:10:28] <Platonides> I wonder if splice(2) would support urandom and a hdd
[22:10:37] <Platonides> I guess it won't

[23:07:15] <ioxzev1z> Platonides, have you benchmarked urandomn vs openssl? The bottleneck for dd on urandom might actually be the write speed of the disk, where reads are fast enough even with switches
[23:08:37] *** Quits: BOKALDO (~BOKALDO@user/bokaldo) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:08:57] <Platonides> good point
[23:09:19] <Platonides> if the disk is slower, the speed of the PRNG is a moot point
[23:10:54] <ioxzev1z> But even with an infinitely fast disk, on a modern processor urandom might be high speed enough to not matter. I saw a benchmark of dd on /dev/zero which (as I guessed) sounds as if it would just put the blocksize of zero into memory rather than making actual reads on /dev/zero, but it makes the reads regardless but hits very high speeds even then
[23:12:57] * ioxzev1z assumed dd on /dev/zero would just allocate blocksize, fill with zero, then use that rather than making read calls to /dev/zero
