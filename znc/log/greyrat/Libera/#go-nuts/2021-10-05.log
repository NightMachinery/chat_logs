[01:33:42] <attila_lendvai> can go 1) compile two different versions of the same module into one binary? or 2) it always picks one version of every included module before compilation?
[01:35:10] <b0nn> when you say - two different versions, are you talking major or minor versions?
[01:35:58] <b0nn> I don't /think/ that two different minor versions can be compiled into a project at the same time - how do you convey to the compiler which version to use for which piece of code)
[01:36:21] <b0nn> I think, though, two major versions can be - because you can import v1, v2, etc
[01:36:47] <fizzie> See https://golang.org/ref/mod#minimal-version-selection for the details of how Go selects a unique *minor* version for every (module, major version) used in a build.
[01:37:39] <attila_lendvai> b0nn, with quite some work there could be some form of sandboxing, but that would not work with e.g. global variables (pardon my ignorance, i'm a go noob, i'm working on the guix packaging of go stuff)
[01:38:32] <attila_lendvai> fizzie, i've seen that, thanks! that applies to 1.17, too, right?
[01:38:59] <bpalmer> go's "global" variables are always package-local
[01:39:22] <fizzie> attila_lendvai: Yes, I don't think there's been any major (no pun intended) changes to MVS.
[01:40:00] <fizzie> The "Major version suffixes" section of that same document also confirms that "multiple major versions of a module [can] coexist in the same build".
[01:43:01] <attila_lendvai> yep, because major versions are effectively different modules on this level
[01:44:54] <b0nn> hmm, took me a minute - the minimum version specified is the go.mod version information for each module to be compiled into the project

[05:18:22] <krux02> I want to say ony TypeA or TypeB
[05:18:49] <fizzie> Not as such. Though if you put a non-exported method in it, only types in the same package can ever implement it.
[05:19:07] <krux02> it is not about exporting
[05:19:18] <krux02> it is about controlling what types are allowed
[05:19:28] <krux02> I want to prevent the wrong types in my collection by accident.
[05:19:53] <krux02> I think I have a solution
[05:20:14] <krux02> give TypeA and TypeB a useless method and put that method in an interface

[06:17:36] <seebs> this does not prevent other people from adding it, though.

[18:11:23] <skeels> is it bad practice for a function parameter to be an array instead of a slice?
[18:13:39] <Tv_> you don't see that happening much outside of crypto
[18:13:59] <Tv_> in crypto code, it's kinda nice to have a guarantee that the key is the length it's supposed to be, and take a *[32]byte or such
[18:14:16] <Tv_> especially with the new conversion support
[18:14:42] <skeels> yeah that's what i'm using [32]byte for sha256 hash
[18:15:19] <Tv_> for hashes it matters less, for secrets use a pointer to avoid leaving copies all over the place
[18:15:43] <skeels> for security reasons?
[18:15:55] <Tv_> but know that [32]byte is harder on your callers to provide, than []byte

There was a vague attempt many years later to make a distinction between "user" and "system" binaries but it never really panned out well due to the lack of clarity about what things went in what places. It's unclear what value you'd derive from artificially splitting up where your compiled binaries end up

[18:49:31] <siXy> when you end up building your .deb or .rpm or whatever you could get your packagemanager to put it in the same place for consistency. But I'm not sure why you'd want the same split in GOPATH
