[21:45:10] <ThePhilgrim> If I'm making a testimonial slide with blockquotes, would you say that I can wrap the blockquote and the author in a <figure> as they do here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure ?
[21:47:29] <stenno> ThePhilgrim: lets read the whatwg specs about <figure> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element
[21:47:48] <ThePhilgrim> Never heard about whatwg
[21:49:09] <stenno> they are the de-facto writer of the specs
[21:49:52] <ThePhilgrim> I had no idea
[21:50:01] <ThePhilgrim> Reading now, but I can't say I exactly understand
[21:50:11] <ThePhilgrim> Blockquotes are for sure flow content
[21:50:28] <stenno> "Self-contained" in this context does not necessarily mean independent. For example, each sentence in a paragraph is self-contained; an image that is part of a sentence would be inappropriate for figure, but an entire sentence made of images would be fitting.
[21:50:41] <ThePhilgrim> But then.. how would we define "self-contained" ?
[21:50:43] <ThePhilgrim> hah
[21:51:25] <ThePhilgrim> But I mean.. each section of a website is somewhat self-contained.. an article is self-contained.. But you don't wrap everything into figures, right?
[21:51:38] <stenno> no, but you can
[21:51:45] <ThePhilgrim> hmm, okay
[21:52:00] <ThePhilgrim> So a testimonial would definitely be self-contained
[21:52:04] <stenno> yes
[21:52:06] <ThePhilgrim> Okay
[21:53:18] <stenno> like its semantic self-containment
[21:53:25] <ThePhilgrim> stenno: would you say that this looks reasonable? https://codepen.io/thephilgrim/pen/pormJdg
[21:54:43] <lilmonkey> Figure for a testimonial, really?
[21:54:56] <stenno> what why not
[21:55:14] <lilmonkey> Let's test: in what content would you refer to, say, "testimonial #2"?
[21:56:20] <lilmonkey> At best, a testimonial is going to be tangentially related to some other content, but even that's probably a stretch.
[21:57:04] <stenno> ooh  i see
[21:57:20] <stenno> ok i misunderstood the 'is referenced by'
[21:57:26] <lilmonkey> Testomonials are generic endorsements, not, say, reviews of a specific service or product
[21:57:31] <lilmonkey> Testimonials*
[21:57:46] <lilmonkey> So I'd say <aside> is what you want
[21:59:13] <stenno> lilmonkey: see here the Example https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote
[22:00:31] <lilmonkey> What about it?
[22:02:53] <stenno> ok the context is not there
[22:03:08] <stenno> presumably this is referenced from another text
[22:03:19] <stenno> another part of the document
[22:04:30] <lilmonkey> Yes
[22:05:18] <lilmonkey> And even then: "For example, a pull quote that repeats content from an article would be more appropriate in an aside than in a figure, because it isn't part of the content, it's a repetition of the content for the purposes of enticing readers or highlighting key topics."
[22:05:28] <lilmonkey> So only if it's not a repetition
[22:05:49] <lilmonkey> But either way, I'm having a hard time seeing a testimonial used as such.
[22:07:26] <stenno> yeah i see
[22:09:56] <stenno> the fact that the blockquote is a testimonial rules it out to be used in a figure even if it might get referenced
[22:11:13] <lilmonkey> I mean, "rules it out" is a bit harsh perhaps, but I really can't think of a valid use case. <aside> makes a million times more sense.
[22:17:27] <ThePhilgrim> lilmonkey, stenno So, did we reach a conclusion here? lilmonkey It's a blockquote, and MDN puts it in a figure.. It's going to be a slider taking up a whole section of the website. Does aside make sense for that?
[22:18:07] <stenno> ThePhilgrim: a <figure> is not feasable here. The fact that mdn lists blockquote inside figure is because of the content of the blockquote
[22:18:14] <lilmonkey> ThePhilgrim, a blockquote can appear in many contexts, <figure> is just one of them that happens to be used as an example there.
[22:18:52] <ThePhilgrim> Hmm, okay. And why is figure not good for a testimonial? 
[22:19:13] <lilmonkey> ThePhilgrim, what is the purpose of this slider? Would you ever refer to a specific testimonial from the "main" content?
[22:19:49] <ThePhilgrim> It's just going to be a carousel in a section of the website. I won't refer to it
[22:20:11] <ThePhilgrim> Ahh.. a <figure> would be like a bar chart or similar.. and then you refer to it as "figure 1.4" or similar
[22:20:47] <lilmonkey> Yes. Which is why I said I'm having a hard time envisioning testimonials ever being used like that :)
[22:20:53] <ThePhilgrim> lilmonkey: Would you say that a figcaption is bad for the "author" of the blockquote?
[22:20:56] <ThePhilgrim> makes sense
[22:22:37] <ThePhilgrim> And also, would you use aside for the <???> in this codepen? https://codepen.io/thephilgrim/pen/pormJdg
[22:23:11] <lilmonkey> ThePhilgrim, no, if a blockquote is contained appropriately in a <figure>, then the <figcaption> is the correct place for attribution.
[22:24:05] <lilmonkey> ThePhilgrim, you can't use <figcaption> outside of a <figure>
[22:24:11] <ThePhilgrim> ah okay
[22:24:48] <ThePhilgrim> So what would you use to wrap the blockquote? div? aside?, and what would you use for the author?
[22:24:55] <lilmonkey> So for a testimonial, you'd probably end up with something like `<aside><blockquote>…</blockquote> — John Doe</aside>`
[22:25:32] <lilmonkey> You don't need anything special for the author. If you need a styling hook you can use a <span> or a <b> I suppose.
[22:26:01] <ThePhilgrim> Ah, okay
[22:26:06] <ThePhilgrim> what is <b> ?
[22:26:32] <lilmonkey> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-b-element
[22:26:49] <lilmonkey> But honestly, thats already a stretch. Just a <span> will do if needed :)
[22:28:56] <ThePhilgrim> Awesome, thanks for your help!
