[11:05:28] <ghost08> I've put it directly into my config.py

[11:06:31] <ghost08> it finds the hostName, it replaces it, and calls redirect, but I still endup on twitter.com instead of nitter.eu
[11:11:00] <Nickli> i quit using that one because it doesn't work let's say someone links old.reddit.com or something which doesn't match exactly

[11:24:24] <Nickli> probably best to open an issue (maybe check for a similar one first) and see if it can be fixed
[11:26:36] <The-Compiler> Nickli, ghost08: this isn't any official API (yet), and the underlying code just calls into QtWebEngine, so chances are we can't to much
[11:26:40] <The-Compiler> s/to/do/
[11:27:03] <The-Compiler> Nickli, ghost08: For starters, remove the "except: pass" which just hides any issues with redirecting
[11:28:06] <Nickli> ... yeah open an issue with the script repo not qutebrowser
[11:36:07] <ghost08> The-Compiler: oh, it fixed it, moving the request.redirect(...) out of the try-except just solved it. But I don't understand why :D
[11:36:14] <The-Compiler> huh
[11:36:24] <The-Compiler> I'd have expected you to get an exception in that case
[11:37:03] <ghost08> I too
[11:37:16] <ghost08> I remade the script like so:

[11:41:06] <The-Compiler> no worries, IRC is ancient :D
[11:41:58] <ghost08> so it works :) i'm happy, now quickly commit it to my dots
[11:42:21] <The-Compiler> you might want to make the exception block even narrower
[11:42:31] <The-Compiler> just a "except KeyError:" around the first line should suffice
[11:43:05] <ghost08> yeah, that's a good idea
[11:43:07] <The-Compiler> and also the redirects *can* fail for some types of requests
[11:43:37] <The-Compiler> if you have a new enough qutebrowser, you can pass ignore_unsupported=True to .redirect() just not raise them as exceptions

[21:23:14] <il> What's the difference between quickmarks and bookmarks
[21:24:50] <il> i figured it out lol
[21:25:01] <il> But I couldn't find anything in documentation
[21:25:21] <rj1> what is the difference?
[21:26:12] <il> with quickmarks, you can give it a short name for opening
[21:26:15] <il> with bookmarks you can't
[21:26:26] <il> you also can open quickmarks with the b/B menu (B for opening in new tab)
[21:27:11] <il> but you can open both with o/O menu
[21:27:33] <The-Compiler> il: https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/faq.asciidoc 12, pretty much 1:1 the question you asked ;)
[21:28:25] <il> The-Compiler, ah, I looked at key binding cheatsheet, quick start guide, documentation of commands and documentation of settings LOL
[21:28:28] <il> I tried, I swera
[21:29:25] <il> Yeah, bookmarks are basically for things which you might want to read/reference later
[21:29:30] <il> quickmarks are for things you open daily
[21:30:33] <il> Also, does qutebrowser not have a manpage or is that a consequence of installing with pip?
[21:31:44] <il> BTW, I have to give compliments to this browser, it's great in every way, I've really been enjoying using it
[21:40:54] <il> Okay, I need help with one more thing. I have a script for opening videos in mpv and I used to run it with ;m

[22:07:23] <The-Compiler> il: it does have a manpage: https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/qutebrowser.1.asciidoc - but yeah, pip isn't able to install system-wide stuff

[22:42:26] <il> ....
[22:42:34] <il> I'm sorry for spamming the channel
[22:53:15] <il> $QUTE_URL is giving me current url if I bind a key to launch hint mode
[22:58:47] <triallax[m]> Any reason to not use `/bin/sh` instead of `/bin`?
[22:58:54] <triallax[m]> To make it run on more systems I guess.
[22:59:45] <emanuele6> /bin is a directory usually
[23:00:08] <triallax[m]> I meant `/bin/bash`, my bad.
[23:00:36] <emanuele6> what is this question about?
[23:01:14] <il> triallax[m], no reason not to, I just put it together in bash a long time ago, it uses /bin/sh on my openbsd system
[23:01:21] <il> (which would be ksh)
[23:01:33] <triallax[m]> Gotcha.
[23:01:50] <triallax[m]> emanuele6: well, now it's answered.
[23:02:10] <il> It's a messy script, I just found out that you should be able to use $QUTE_URL for hinted URL, when script is launched from hint mode
[23:02:29] <il> That would make it a bit neater, but it's not working
[23:03:15] <il> And also, you can put it in .local/share/qutebrowser/userscripts/ , as the userscript writing guide page says, after which it can be run with spawn --userscript 'name' where name is the name of the script
[23:03:25] <il> ~/.local*
[23:04:17] <il> I'm probably not understanding QUTE_MODE right

[23:36:12] <The-Compiler> il: how do you launch it from hint mode?
[23:36:58] <il> The-Compiler, I tried :hint links spawn --userscript
[23:37:09] <il> The-Compiler, and :bind key hint links spawn --userscript
[23:38:30] <The-Compiler> il: that will spawn the userscript via :spawn, which knows nothing about hints
[23:38:39] <The-Compiler> il: use :hint links userscript"
[23:39:23] <il> The-Compiler, yes, that works
[23:41:20] <il> well, there you go
[23:42:43] <il> I guess this would be considered a 'userscript' lol https://0x0.st/oqgk.sh
