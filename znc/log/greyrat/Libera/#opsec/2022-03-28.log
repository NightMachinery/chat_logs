[16:21:32] <Joanna> It’s been getting a lot of cyberattacks and is blocked because of politics
[16:26:00] <inky_> i am in between calls. another call in 7 minutes. but i'd like to tell you, joanna, and i'd rike to tell tonystone, that it hurts so much when u don't see what i see, how cussia threatens and pressures everybody they can. how they don't believe in freedom and democrary, and how they have post imperial pain, about the loss of the land.
[16:26:21] <inky_> yesterday i was chatting in a russian language political chat
[16:26:46] <inky_> and they were saying, we need ussr space integrated in russia, tden eastern europe
[16:26:50] <inky_> then all europe
[16:27:14] <inky_> because we hate them, hate their 'freedoms',
[16:27:27] <inky_> they also hate lgbtq ppl
[16:27:32] <inky_> so i was saying
[16:27:45] <inky_> don't u have enough laand?
[16:28:03] <inky_> what do u want to build that doesn't fit there?
[16:28:12] <inky_> can u just leave us alone
[16:28:24] <inky_> they are regional bullies
[16:28:30] <Atque> inky_: Are you Ukrainian?
[16:28:30] <inky_> bully of the yrd
[16:28:44] <inky_> that will beat up anyone who doesnt obey
[16:28:48] <inky_> i am armenian
[16:28:52] <Atque> Not all Russians are nationalist, but it is an issue, sure.
[16:28:56] <inky_> and i have a call in 2 mins
[16:29:11] <Atque> To a Russian?
[16:29:36] <Atque> Oh wells, I'm in Australia. I hope it all settles soon.
[16:29:57] <Atque> Maybe, Putin will just die of a heart attack or something random and the next guy won't be as bad?
[16:45:24] *** Joins: SANCLA (~SANCLA@hackalot/deelnemer/Sancla)
[16:47:24] <Joanna> inky_: I have heard that the country Azerbaijan is attacking again
[16:49:32] <Joanna> Is that true. Sorry I’m so uninformed about your part of the world. Have you heard from anyone in Ukraine lately?
[16:54:45] <Joanna> It’s a shame that countries can’t just be left alone. But there is a very long history of many countries beating up and plundering weaker countries, the other countries in Europe and Americans are not saints by any means. Most have histories of committing atrocities. I think it’s easy to idealize places we have never been to and people we have never met.

[17:01:41] <Joanna> Just because people claim that they care about democracy and human rights doesn’t make it true. Why would countries care more about people in other countries than their own citizens? It doesn’t even make any sense does it?  Why would a country with hundreds of thousands of people in poverty be spending money abroad like a drunken sailor?

[17:10:24] <Joanna> There are many many different ways to split people up into different groups and have them fight. In Ukraine I heard they have resurrected actual azov batalkion Nazis with Nazi tattoos all over them and gave them a lot of money and weapons. Is this not true?
[17:18:27] <Joanna> Another thing just because it’s russian chat doesn’t mean that the people in there are being truthful about who they are or what their agenda is. In my experience there are a lot of people that like to stir up trouble online to further an agenda. I’ve seen people who claim to be in favor of one thing pretending to be in favor of the exact opposite before. Their goal is to manipulate people’s emotions and then use them as tools 
[17:18:27] <Joanna> to further whatever agenda.. it’s just like a bullfight which makes bull angry then uses for entertainment then kills it.
[17:21:15] <Joanna> There are people who want to have a world war 3 in Europe for fun and profit obviously and could care less about how many Europeans are killed. I really hope this doesn’t happen.

[19:27:24] <inky_> to give u
[19:27:35] <inky_> so as a conspiracy i should add that
[19:27:59] <inky_> there were a strange respiratory epidemic in the city after the explosion
[19:28:14] <inky_> and there were guest arbeiters from uhan
[19:28:32] <inky_> so maybe they carried the virus to china
[19:28:45] <inky_> and then uhan epidemy happened
[19:29:20] <inky_> so maybe this lab also had coronavirus variant.

[20:06:58] <inky_> i would say, they have nothing else to suggest
[20:07:01] <inky_> also
[20:07:18] <inky_> lgbtq hatred has different roots in usa and russia
[20:07:28] <inky_> in usa the roots are religious
[20:07:54] <inky_> in russia after the ussr the population is not religious
[20:08:08] <inky_> the hatred comes from prison culture.
[20:08:41] <inky_> and putin himself is a man who grew up in a leningrad yard by being friends with people of prison values.
[20:09:22] <inky_> so what he says often is recognizable to those who know russian and who xnow the culturemof thieves
[20:09:53] <inky_> he says 'will break by the knee'
[20:10:07] <inky_> says 'kill in the toilet'
[20:10:16] <inky_> or literally make wet
[20:10:23] <jessicara> yeah
[20:10:23] <inky_> which means kill in russian
[20:10:41] <inky_> or says 'u need to hit first'.
[20:10:52] <jessicara> it is the same here among some circles
[20:10:58] <inky_> he has a book about himself
[20:11:03] <inky_> how did he grow up
[20:11:14] <inky_> atd who taught him 'important things'
[20:11:51] <inky_> and one of those, almost his father, was a trainer of sambo from the sportschool 'trud'
[20:12:06] <inky_> and he was from prison
[20:12:24] <inky_> and he was a 'respectabre thiev'
[20:12:37] <inky_> so all these 'hit first' comes from him.
[20:13:17] <inky_> it's all in putin's book about himself. he ordered that book in the beginning of 2000s.
[20:13:48] <inky_> so people found the grave of that thieve now.
[20:14:01] <inky_> it has interesting poetry on the gravestone.
[20:14:04] <inky_> (:
[20:14:13] <inky_> well.
[20:14:47] <inky_> and all his friends who are today oligarchs are from that sportschoor.
[20:14:51] <inky_> most of them.
[20:15:12] <inky_> because those who are friends can make busitess
[20:15:25] <inky_> for others tdey have the law.
[20:15:29] <inky_> (:
[20:18:22] <jessicara> yeah you got it quite right
[20:21:13] <jessicara> mostly just disagree on the nature of the west being significantly different
