[12:21:57] <hirez> so I wrote an implementation of graham's scan in CL and it actually works :D 
[12:21:58] <hirez> https://hastebin.com/igapemasop.swift
[12:22:21] <hirez> its so elegant looking in cl, lol. If anyone has any feedback on how I can make this more...canonical lisp I'd appreciate it
[12:23:56] <beach> (setf i (+ i 1)) is better expressed as (incf i)
[12:24:16] <beach> There is no need for a newline after LET* when the body lines are not long.
[12:24:28] <hirez> old habits from less refined languages die very hard
[12:24:30] <hirez> haha
[12:24:32] <hirez> okay cool
[12:24:42] <hirez> thank you :D
[12:24:59] <beach> Similarly, no need for a newline after a PROGN.
[12:25:43] <hirez> I see yeah, paredit cleans up nicely when I remove it. 
[12:25:45] <beach> Instead of using PUSH and REVERSE, you can use COLLECT in LOOP.
[12:26:16] <moon-child> hirez: I think it would be cleaner to avoid the pushes in the body, as in (let* ... (stack (list (pop sorted) min))
[12:26:46] <hirez> Could I? I basically have to hold an element in `sorted` based on the `left` function. I will read up on collect. 
[12:27:10] <hirez> Im not sure how I could avoid the push because the algorithm is dependent on a stack. I'd be interested in hearing how to avoid it.
[12:27:10] <beach> hirez: You would need an IF clause in the LOOP.
[12:27:42] <hirez> I see, I'll crack open the hyperspec again.
[12:27:43] <hirez> haha
[12:28:04] <hirez> ooh I see what you mean moon-child 
[12:28:05] <hirez> sorry 
[12:28:11] <hirez> yes indeed I can remove those
[12:29:42] <moon-child> (that's a matter of personal style, though; others would consider it more consistent to view the algorithm as a sequence of pushes onto an empty list)

[12:49:22] <dsk> It seems obvious that (push thing stack) is equivalent (setf stack (cons thing stack)) so that wouldn't be an issue. But is (setf (car '(foo)) 'bar) okay?
[12:49:40] <phoe> very no
[12:49:49] <phoe> '(foo) is a literal list and therefore mutating it is UB
[12:49:58] <phoe> and mutating its CAR counts as mutating it
[12:50:26] <dsk> Ah, okay, good. Not *completely* losing it.

[12:58:11] <phoe> it's just that '(), treated as a list, has no components to mutate

[13:01:16] <dsk> Right. Somehow my brain went on the fritz and told me that NIL is actually a cons, the CAR and CDR of which are both NIL.
[13:01:51] *** Parts: contrapunctus (a75f5b1571@2a00:c70:1:178:170:40:189:1) ()
[13:01:55] <dsk> But I understand that while the CAR and CDR of NIL are both NIL, it is not a cons, though it is a list, and there's only one of it.
[13:02:09] <phoe> CAR and CDR of NIL are special cases
[13:02:24] <phoe> NIL isn't a cons, correct
[13:02:31] <moon-child> imagine if you could (setf (car nil) ...)
[13:03:16] <dsk> I feel like that may have been possible in some historical Lisp.

[18:38:13] <Fade> I'm seeing a weird failure in Sly I haven't encountered before. When I press ',' to enter a REPL shortcut, the comma isn't captured and secondary shortcut entry doesn't pop up. I just get the raw comma in the REPL. have  any of you encountered this?
[18:38:58] <jmercouris> Fade: perhaps the cursor has included an extra space?
[18:39:02] <jmercouris> and it is not obvious?
[18:39:41] <Fade> if there's a space it doesn't exist in any context that I can interact with it using the standard emacs machinery.
[18:40:22] <jmercouris> it has happend to me other times in other buffers that use the LUI library
[18:40:29] <jmercouris> or whatever it is called
[18:41:39] <jmercouris> it is a library used by circe and others to show like a prompt and history, like in the REPL
[18:42:18] <Fade> I'm not getting an error, I'm just not getting the command, so I'm not surehow to debug it.

[22:03:35] <Inline> ok, i found the problem with qix
[22:04:41] <Inline> there is a xlib:display-force-output *display* when replaced with xlib:display-finish-output it works as expected

[22:12:28] <Inline> ok, the only difference between the two seems to be this: both force any buffered output to be sent to the X server, but finish-output is the only one waiting till all requests are received and processed by the X server
[22:12:39] <Inline> hmmm
[22:14:01] <Inline> ah it's the same error with petal
[22:14:11] <Inline> there it uses force-output too
[22:14:17] <Inline> so nothing gets drawn here over
[22:14:25] <Inline> i get a white window but nothing happens
[22:14:30] <Inline> will change that too
[22:15:32] <Nilby> When I'm working with CLX interactively I often make it put an implicit display-finish-output after every repl comamnd.

[22:48:59] <Inline> oooh
[22:49:06] <Inline> now i get the bouce example
[22:49:13] <Inline> bounce*
[22:49:24] <Inline> both shove-bounce and bounce are wrong
[22:49:37] <Inline> tho they depend only on 1 definition
[22:49:41] <Inline> wait
[22:49:48] <Inline> i got both working now
[22:50:06] <Inline> the windows themselves are supposed to be empty, but the windows themselves are the bouncing ones
[22:50:21] <Inline> i.e. bounce bounces to the bottom then up then down decreasingly
[22:50:30] <Inline> and shove does the same whilst heading to the right
[22:50:47] <Inline> i'll post the corrected example

[22:53:54] <Inline> https://termbin.com/j033
[22:57:01] <Inline> ok i think now i got all the demos working correctly
[22:57:45] <Inline> the bounce and shove bounce demos are not about things jumping inside windows, they are about the windows itself jumping around in some manner
[22:58:21] <Inline> mine head down to the bottom of my screen as if i have left a ball down on the floor
[22:58:46] <Inline> and the shove bounce is similar it just has a velocity to the right too

[23:04:22] <dieggsy> is there an easy way of calling some code inline at macro expansion time without another defmacro ?
[23:07:18] *** Joins: GreaseMonkey (greaser@user/greasemonkey)
[23:07:23] <Nilby> You can just call any function that's allready defined when the macro is being defined.
[23:09:28] <Nilby> I'm not sure if that's what you mean? but something like: (defmacro foo (x) `(print ,(sqrt x)))
[23:11:06] <dieggsy> Nilby: i think im basically asking for the macro-equivalent of a lambda. like an unnamed macro that i can call/expand inline
[23:11:43] <dieggsy> i suppose you could just write... some macro that does this generically lol
[23:11:54] <dieggsy> but if there was already a built-in way
[23:11:58] <Nilby> macrolet ?
[23:12:26] <dieggsy> still named, though local
[23:12:32] <dieggsy> fair
[23:13:10] <Josh_2> With ironclad a 'sha512 hmac' requires making a hmac-digest with my private key, then using hmac-digest with the octets I wish to digest?
[23:13:20] <Josh_2> Can't for the life of me get the same output as the example :(
[23:14:54] <Josh_2> ah frick
[23:19:02] <Josh_2> Finally did it
[23:19:15] <Josh_2> Another one of those silly mistakes
[23:23:23] <flip214> Josh_2: I'm using (ironclad::hkdf-extract 'ironclad:sha256 secret string), what are you doing?
[23:27:51] <Nilby> dieggsy: If you have an example of what you want to do, it's likely someone here can come up with a nice way.
[23:31:14] <dieggsy> Nilby: it would literally be like an inline (mexpand (format nil "~a~b" "foo" "bar")) becomes "foobar" in the compiled code. As opposed to having to (defmacro thing () (format nil "~a~b" "foo" "bar")) and calling (thing). I can of course just write that mexpand macro myself, was just wondering if there's some clever built-in i don't know about
[23:32:40] <dieggsy> in fact, i'm fairly certain that's just as easy as (defmacro mexpand (exp) ',exp)
[23:32:49] <dieggsy> er, backquote that is, not regular quote
[23:34:15] <Josh_2> Well I can't seem to get it
[23:35:55] <Josh_2> flip214:  heres what I'm trying to do https://plaster.tymoon.eu/view/2487#2487 
[23:36:08] <Josh_2> I tried using babel:octets-to-string but that always fails :(

[23:41:10] <dieggsy> macro it is then
[23:41:59] <dieggsy> i'm not against writing a macro, just would be nice if we had a built-in inline form that does the same. of course, when you can write that yourself, no point baking in every little thing into the language lol
