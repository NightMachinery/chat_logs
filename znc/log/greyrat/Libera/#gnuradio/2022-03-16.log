[01:04:02] <muaddib[m]> <xfol[m]> "Is there any way to get a faster..." <- Setting the update period to a smaller number is correct. That’s all you should have to do. You said that 32k is a ‘high rate’ and that’s relative to your input signal, so setting it to 0.03 is a 300hz update rate, might have to go lower.
[01:05:26] *** Joins: ChealRipster (~RealChips@user/ChealRipster)
[01:06:27] <patchvonbraun[m]> Keep in mind that Gnu Radio buffering may prevent that GUI bit from seeing enough samples during the given time interval to satisfy that update rate.  You can play with max/min output size to control Gnu Radio buffer allocation strategy.  But I've never really gotten into deeply grokking that stuff myself.  32k is a really low sample rate relative to most GR applications, and relative to its default buffer sizes, etc.

[03:58:32] <drmpeg> muaddib[m] I fooled around with cset on RISC-V today.
[03:59:24] <drmpeg> It sort of works.
[04:00:04] <drmpeg> The directory structure in /sys/fs/cgroup is totally different.
[04:00:50] <muaddib[m]> That’s sort of good!
[04:01:26] <drmpeg> This is on Ubuntu, where I could just apt-get install hwloc and cpuset.
[04:02:00] <drmpeg> Not sure about the Icicle board.
[04:02:31] <drmpeg> I'll guess it's using some Yocto thingy.
[04:03:38] <drmpeg> I was able to run:
[04:03:42] <drmpeg> sudo cset shield --sysset=system --userset=sdr --cpu=2,3 --kthread=on
[04:04:00] <drmpeg> And that seemed to work good.
[04:04:35] <drmpeg> But there is no /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset directory.
[04:05:29] <drmpeg> So I couldn't start a program in the "sdr" cpus.
[04:07:30] <muaddib[m]> This was a precursor of a bigger plan. My friend wants to do performance benchmarking of GNURadio flowgraphs on a riscv. 
[04:07:31] <muaddib[m]> Do you have any other suggestions for how to go about performance benchmarking? Like, run a flowgraph on an x86, then run it on the riscv. Tell the ‘difference’. Something like performance counters maybe? 
[04:08:46] <drmpeg> I can usually get a pretty good feel just from htop.
[04:12:42] <muaddib[m]> Same here. That’s what I’ve always done. Was hoping for something that could show in a bit more detail. I’ve googled around and there’s actually a lot of utilities for monitoring performance, but as always gotta run it through the filter of ‘yea but is that gonna be good for DSP?’. A lot of them are for workload on web servers and stuff.
[04:17:08] <drmpeg> I've used OProfile before. I was at least able to understand it.
[04:23:01] <jsallay[m]> I'm a big fan of vtune. It allows for remote profilling for situations like this, but I've never used that feature before.
[04:23:27] <muaddib[m]> Can’t use that on riscv
[04:23:40] <muaddib[m]> It’s intel only right?
[04:24:27] <muaddib[m]> I’ve heard good things, just didn’t think that was an option here
[04:29:45] <jsallay[m]> You are right. I wasn't thinking.
[04:32:42] <drmpeg> No package even for oprofile on Ubuntu riscv64.
[04:32:47] <jsallay[m]> Perf is my go to tool when I can't use vtune, but it looks that that is only partially supported on riscv.
[04:33:48] <drmpeg> I find perf to be confusing. But that's on me.
[04:34:52] <jsallay[m]> There is a learning curve, but I really like it.

[17:33:32] <muaddib[m]> That would make sense. The throttle block is your rate limiter , so you’re pushing data through 10 times faster by going from 32k to 320k
[17:33:45] <xfol[m]> I'm missing more data by doing this (losing the "real time"ness) of the input signal
[17:34:45] <xfol[m]> my goal is to be able to see more of the signal drawn to the display without gaps
[17:37:48] <muaddib[m]> Can you send a pastebin link for your flow graph?
[17:38:05] <muaddib[m]> Oh wait, your screenshot isn’t that complicated :-)
[17:41:17] <xfol[m]> the sine wave is too repetitive to tell - but in my real application it's clear that increasing the throttle sample rate causes the time sink to skip more of the real data. That and I would have to increase the sample rate on everything else in my flowgraph by the same factor
[17:49:15] <xfol[m]> a more fair example is if the number of points is ~1/30 of the sample rate i.e. 1024 since I'm trying to achieve 30Hz (conservative target) update rate so here's the flowgraph with minor tweaks and attempting to trigger on every 1024 samples using a length tag: https://pastebin.com/RsQ9KnD0
[17:49:32] <xfol[m]> * update rate - so here's
[17:51:14] <xfol[m]> it should be possible for the time sink to show every single sample without dropping any using this setup
[17:53:23] <muaddib[m]> So you have a signal that’s  sampled at 32Ksps but you want to see more than 32K points Per second?
[17:54:05] <xfol[m]> no I want to see all 32k points - they should be shown sequentially 1024 points at a time over the course of 30 screen updates
[17:54:21] <xfol[m]> at the moment it's only showing about 10k points
[17:55:20] <xfol[m]> you can tell just by looking at it that the sink is showing only 10 updates per second
[17:56:23] <xfol[m]> If I change the update period of QT GUI Time Sink to 0.2 then it appears to be about half as fast as if I set it to 0.1 / 0.03 / 0.01 / 0
[17:56:38] <xfol[m]> it just won't go faster than 0.1s update
[17:57:08] <xfol[m]> is that not the behaviour you're seeing on your end?
