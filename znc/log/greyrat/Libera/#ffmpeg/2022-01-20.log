[00:00:02] <alphamule> I was actually curious how WEBM encodes timing info but... I guess I don't really need to figure that out.  heh
[00:00:19] <alphamule> Reinventing almost compatible wheels
[00:02:03] <alphamule> You'll likely NEVER see this supported in mainstream formats (and maybe not even 'supported' if eccentric one/s):  Variable line resolutions
[00:02:25] <alphamule> And yes, there are outputs from some devices that abuse NTSC standards from back in the day
[00:02:44] <alphamule> Different refresh timings per line
[00:02:56] <alphamule> I don't even think HDMI supports that
[00:03:48] *** Quits: KombuchaKip (~kip@192.252.230.5) (Quit: Leaving.)
[00:04:07] <kepstin> well, the sampling frequency of the analog to digital converter and the "resolution" of the device that produced the signal don't really have anything to do with each-other.
[00:04:16] <alphamule> Technically, you can also have stuff like recordings of ivdeo that changes resolutions like say, recording of a ccomputer booting up and changing to different ones.
[00:04:35] *** Quits: orthoplex64 (~crm@70.120.0.94) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:04:43] <kepstin> I mean, you can do that in mpeg-ts :/
[00:04:47] <alphamule> And that's another issue.  The software gets confused because it expects all lines are the same.
[00:04:51] <kepstin> (ffmpeg doesn't handle it very well)

[00:05:36] <kepstin> mpegts broadcasts on tv systems support switchint between different resolutions and framerates.
[00:05:43] <alphamule> Ah
[00:05:50] <alphamule> But I bet not per line
[00:05:51] <kepstin> that said, it's not often used because tv receivers don't handle it well :/
[00:06:12] <alphamule> Yeah, decoders/transcoders are... not optimized for that
[00:06:22] <alphamule> Buggy I mean
[00:06:50] <kepstin> nope, afaik no digital video system supports different lengths per line. they expect all lines have the same number of samples with the same timing.
[00:07:30] <alphamule> And yes, Sega, I'm looking at you.  Dirty picture processing units.
[00:07:36] <kepstin> (which is fine when sampling analog video, since you're just running a adc at a fixed frequency, more or less)
[00:08:10] <alphamule> I remember some other technical reasons why it's a pain.  Like, PLLs
[00:09:29] <alphamule> In theory, you can process the thing exhaustively, looking for the refresh pulses, and adjusting frame buffer amount used but... this is not sounding fun
[00:10:00] <alphamule> I imagine it is also easier to design it to not hold a lonnnnnnnng buffer
[00:10:08] <kepstin> sampling of analog NTSC video has been more or less standardized as running at 13.5MHz, fwiw. (some higher end ADCs run at multiples of that and filter/downscale the result)
[00:10:15] <alphamule> But instead constantly reusing a line bufer of (fixed length)
[00:10:49] <alphamule> Thinking like some FPGA designs.  See:  Kevtris
[00:11:23] <alphamule> He used a line buffer to get the lowest latency, and as bonus needed less RAM. haha
[00:13:01] <kepstin> in most NTSC video capture operations, you probably want to run a comb filter, which usually requires buffering 2-3 lines
[00:13:12] <alphamule> Anyways, time to get cracking on those two script generators
[00:13:31] <alphamule> Well, timing list converters
[00:13:49] <alphamule> I think he said 2-3
[00:13:55] <alphamule> Don't remember
[00:14:50] <kepstin> (comb filter helps with composite input sources in particular, if you have component or s-video input i don't think it's needed or desirable)

[02:18:58] <MrPaul> I've been working through trying to fix a ts file that I captured with streamlink for a few days now so that I can cut commercials out of it.  It plays back & seeks perfectly fine in both VLC & MPC-BE.  When I use ffmpeg to convert to mp4 it ends up out of sync.  Also, it shows as a 28hour file when it's really about 2.5hr.
[02:18:59] <MrPaul> With the help of folks here I think I'm close as I can reencode and get the resulting file to show as the proper duration with playback still having synced audio but when I try to remove commercials with ffmpeg with input or output seeking it goes back to out of sync and videoredo just craps out in general.
[02:18:59] <MrPaul> 'ffmpeg -vsync passthrough -copyts -fflags +genpts -i index.ts -shortest -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 160K "index.mp4"'

[03:11:19] <taokit> can I simply change file extension from mov to mp4 and expect resulting file to be valid and playable?
[03:12:54] <taokit> ffmpeg demuxer seems to treat them as single format not sure about others
[03:14:48] <MrPaul> The extension is like a hint to give the player some idea of what it's being handed but as you can tell, by renaming it, the extension is not definitive.
[03:15:11] <MrPaul> Just like if you put an apple pie in a pizza box.  When you open that box (the extension) you can tell that it's not a pizza
[03:15:31] <aphysically> i love pizza
[03:15:38] <BtbN> mp4 and mov are the same format, with different restrictions
[03:15:41] <MrPaul> There is additional metadata inside the file that says exactly what it is.  Run the file through the linux "file" command or mediainfo and you will see more detail.

[17:56:24] <orbitz> I'm building a conference app with node and vue.js . I need a way to record the conferences and I thought that ffmpeg would be good for that, though the npm's last update was 9 years ago. Any recommendation?
[17:57:48] <orbitz> 0.0.4 is the latest version?
[17:58:58] <orbitz> I see 5.0 in here, definitely not using the one from npm D:
[18:03:15] <orbitz> But it seems that I don't have many choices for nodejs, if someone could give me an advice that would be awesome :)

[23:15:05] <kepstin> iirc all that npm module does is provide a wrapper to assist in generating command lines for the ffmpeg cli tool?

[23:18:57] <lmat> I have several video files and need to remove the last five seconds of each. How do I do this with ffmpeg?
[23:19:32] <lmat> There are a lot of possible solutions online, but they all seem a little more complicated than what I want, and the one that looked perfect (https://ottverse.com/remove-last-10-seconds-of-a-video-using-ffmpeg/) didn't remove the last x seconds, it PRESERVED the last x seconds and removed everything else :-/
[23:20:23] <lmat> From what I'm reading, it is looking like I'll need to tell ffmpeg not "remove last five seconds" but rather "keep the first X-5 seconds" (where X is the total number of seconds in the file.
[23:20:36] <lmat> Seems a little janky, so I thought I would come here to get the real story.

[23:52:58] <kepstin> indeed; the general process is to use some tool (e.g. ffprobe) to find out how long the file is, then build an ffmpeg command that trims at the desired end point.
