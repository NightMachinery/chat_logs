[01:31:18] <Kaiod> Hi guys, Github invited me to test the Copilot preview, which was the focus of one of the FSF calls. I'm testing it to see what it's like, and everyone who was invited must agree to the telemetry terms (https://docs.github.com/pt/github/copilot/about-github-copilot-telemetry) and use their Github account to validate the invitation, and be able to use it. Would you like me to keep you posted about it here?
[01:31:51] *** Joins: neox (8fafd43faa@user/neox)
[01:33:31] <DiffieHellman> Yes keep us posted on the fight against co-pilot.

[01:37:43] <White_Flame> I woudl think that apart from flooding, why would there be a problem?

[18:25:38] <arh> I don't care if Trump creates an instance which federates or not, what I care is that they don't violate AGPL and this doesn't become a thing.
[18:26:00] <arh> The Trump case is very important in advocacy of copyleft and the GPL license family.
[18:26:22] <arh> FSF and Conservancy should do whatever they can to stop this.

[18:27:14] <AndrewYu> Yup
[18:28:37] <arh> Trump won't care about public attack. He enjoys it. So there should be other actions as well.
[18:32:41] <zleap> While i support court action, spreading the word will be very very effective, so share about joining the fediverse, share about the fsf, gnu, gpl  etc on as many platforms
[18:33:03] <zleap> arh, +1 to the advocacy 
[18:33:45] <arh> Of course we should spread the word, but that's not enough and we should think about other possible ways as well.
[18:35:04] <M6piz7wk[m]> <arh> "Trump won't care about public..." <- More like politics of hate.. this way everyone in FLOSS is going to attack him only for him to do like "oh i missunderstood and i do what you want" for people to talk about him

[18:39:41] <Kaiod> The student bodies in Brazil, UBES, UNE, and APNG, are gigantic representative and union entities that need to take some position on the issue of student surveillance. Today the state pays for Google Workspace and forces students to use it, moreover, it contains all their data. These entities have money and can change this, but instead of taking a stand, they use their own Google workspace to collect student data for campaigns and congresses.
[18:39:41] <Kaiod> Furthermore, they are not in compliance with Brazil's General Law of Data Protection in some situations. 
[18:40:01] <zleap> Kaiod, there is the fsf in Latin America too http://www.fsfla.org/svnwiki/
[18:40:44] <zleap> Libreplanet committee are looking for people to help so maybe see if you and others can get a slot at libreplanet 2022 
[18:41:42] <Kaiod> But it is that FSFLA is at a standstill, I even want to participate more in it to change this, and I needed some help from you to be able to write something or try to pressure in some way.

[18:44:25] <Kaiod> It could be a more focused campaign for the students in Brazil, or something like that, or a document for these entities signed by the FSF. We need an attitude, excellent goals for this already exist. Including, who knows, maybe this will help the Ministry of Education to rename Educational Linux to Educational GNU/Linux. They don't really accept GNU in any name.

[18:46:38] <zleap> how do the students you talk to feel about google and data
[18:47:19] <zleap> in some ways the argumetn should be use privscy friendly tools such as next cloud rather than saying don't use google,  the latter does not suggest an alternative
[18:48:07] <Kaiod> zleap: Simple, they don't find anything. They find this surveillance common for two reasons, one because there is no option, the second is because they live as if in a trance for lack of information
[18:48:40] <zleap> so they are open to change
[18:48:47] <zleap> just don't know about alternatives

[18:51:13] <Kaiod> zleap: The students yes, the state I don't know if you can say the same, possibly not, because a contract was made with the company without consent of students or parents.
[18:51:43] <zleap> well start simple,  start with getting students on board

[19:13:38] <M6piz7wk[m]> FWIW in terms of politics i would make a document focusing on single issue that i want to handle and then got people to sign it so that FSFLA can't ignore it and has to respond on it
