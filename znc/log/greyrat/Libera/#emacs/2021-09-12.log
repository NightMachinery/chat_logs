[07:59:12] <Sketch> there's a lot of overlap between perl and sed/awk/bash

[08:04:04] <greppy> johnjay: It depends on what you are doing, I end up using sed and awk fairly often, along with python for anything that needs a little more massaging.  I've written I don't know how much perl/php/ruby/python over the years, but I'm just a system/network admin, not a developer :)

[08:36:33] <greppy> the annoying thing for me has always been that the content providers require the cable companies to package stuff together and charge based on the number of people that have that "package"  which is why you will sometimes see a channel go away for a while because they are trying to negotiate a new contract and they want more money for the content or they want more customers to have to pay for it.
[08:37:18] <homerj> I'll tell you what's annoying, the whole idea of when Hulu started was they had the sane realization that no one wanted to spend money on every network's streaming service

[08:38:22] <johnjay> greppy: i feel like sed and awk are useless though since perl could do any task

[08:39:40] <greppy> johnjay: perl is also a lot "heavier" solution instead of using sed and awk, depending on what you are doing, and perl isn't always installed, while I have yet to run into a *nix system that doesn't have sed or awk.
[08:40:09] <homerj> yeah, I put sed and awk in the same category as vi(m)
[08:40:29] <homerj> they aren't daily drivers for tools, but you're going to be on a system at some point that doesn't have a perl, python, emacs, whatever
[08:40:37] <johnjay> greppy: ah yeah i had a vague inkling that was the case
[08:40:57] <johnjay> but it's nice to hear that confirmed. yeah what homerj said
[08:41:37] <homerj> I don't even know what the state of perl is in 2021
[08:41:42] <greppy> I initially learned vi because it was installed on everything I had to work on, be it IRIX, SunOS, Solaris, Linux, *BSD, whatever :) same for sed and awk.
[08:41:42] <Sketch> i used to use sed for editing files when emacs wasn't installed, before i learned some basic vi
[08:41:45] <homerj> I haven't written a line of code in it for over a decade
[08:42:16] <greppy> I stopped working with perl about 5 years ago when I changed jobs and had  the opportunity to just use python instead :)

[09:28:17] <bpalmer> the cli link I gave above is github's official client, but of course that means it won't work with other providers.

[10:15:08] <codingquark> Yeah, better buy a monitor that supports usb-c if buying new.
[10:15:15] <homerj> because that's also power, so you need to find one that does power and 4k/60, which means it can't have a usb port on it

[10:15:48] *** Quits: slowButPresent (~slowButPr@user/slowbutpresent) (Quit: leaving)
[10:15:49] <homerj> yeah, that's the tell-tale sign if the adapter can do 4k/60, it can't have a usb port
[10:15:56] <bpalmer> getting usb-c cables that support display is a terrible experience
[10:15:59] <homerj> just usb-c for power, and then hdmi and/or displayport
[10:16:12] <codingquark> bpalmer: is it? Do tell
[10:16:35] <homerj> 4k/60 requires all the data lanes
[10:16:43] <bpalmer> try searching for a usb-c cable and then figure out what capabilities it has.
[10:16:54] <codingquark> Oh yes, that is one tough job
[10:16:59] <homerj> usb port means that the adapter uses one of those to drive the usb port, and you drop to 30hz

[10:17:46] <codingquark> The me in text form
[10:18:04] <homerj> the apple adapter for usb->displayport doesn't do 4k/60

[10:19:09] <codingquark> ,laugh

[10:19:38] <bpalmer> at least, that's what I *think* is the case. This is all really badly documented, too.
[10:20:06] <homerj> well, I have a Dell adapter that I use with my laptop, that does do 4k/60, then I use just a normal displayport cable
[10:20:15] <codingquark> May be one has to hire a "technical expert" to help find the exact wire
[10:20:18] <homerj> having usb-c on the monitor is kinda pointless
[10:20:27] <bpalmer> So now I'm resolved ot just use hdmi->usb-c adapters separate from power usb-c
[10:20:32] <homerj> it's nice to have I guess, if you wanted just a type-c to type-c connection
[10:20:58] <codingquark> I want usb type c everywhere
[10:21:09] <homerj> I also have a cable that's just straight type-c on one end, and DP on the other
[10:21:17] <bpalmer> Before my cable went bad, I liked having power and video go over a single usb-c cable, I admit; it's the sort of thing that made me think my next desktop will actually have wires under control

[14:11:49] <rnkn> https://mubi.com/films/3723/ratings/24347965
[14:11:51] <codingquark> Hopefully today
[14:12:09] <rnkn> codingquark: that is an excellent double
[14:12:26] <rnkn> I admire how disparate the choices are
[14:12:29] <codingquark> rnkn: quite a review
[14:12:32] <parsnip> ZOOM!
[14:13:37] <rnkn> I was disappointed when I saw The Fountain upon release, because it was planned at a $70M film then got cut down to $35M so it does feel more constrained than it aspires to be
[14:13:47] <muradm> currently, in org mode, my completion automatically capitalizes #+BEGIN_SRC for instance, all the org mode tags.. who controls that? i like #+begin_src or #+title more, where to look at to change it
[14:14:17] <rnkn> but revisiting it, I mean... death is the road to awe...
[14:14:19] <codingquark> rnkn: does your blog have an RSS feed?
[14:14:58] <codingquark> Also, the choices are disparate because I generally go into very weird places of thoughts after watching a Jarmusch movie
[14:15:35] <rnkn> yeah I think it's /feed.xml
[14:16:00] <codingquark> It is indeed! Thanks!
[14:16:10] <rnkn> but this is probably more interesting: https://fc2000.substack.com

[15:04:34] <talismanick> wasamasa: I already liked nov.el a lot, but didn't know where the gif on the homepage was from
[15:04:44] <talismanick> I just looked again, and I do know now
[15:05:04] <talismanick> and it makes me like it even more
[15:05:11] <wasamasa> lol
[15:06:20] <talismanick> wasamasa: it's safe to open sketchy epubs in Emacs... right?
[15:06:40] <wasamasa> nov.el punts to shr.el for that
[15:06:57] <wasamasa> so as long as shr.el doesn't do anything wild like evaluating random strings inside an epub, you'll be fine
[15:07:28] <talismanick> wasamasa: It's just a zip archive of html, right?
[15:07:31] <wasamasa> yes
[15:07:37] <wasamasa> shr.el is a HTML renderer
[15:07:44] <wasamasa> used by M-x eww
[15:07:49] <wasamasa> and a bunch of other things
[15:07:55] <talismanick> Okay, I remembered the details of a format correctly! Progress!
[15:08:17] <talismanick> and html is safe
[15:08:24] <wasamasa> should be
[15:08:35] <talismanick> who would do want to punish a light novel reader, anyways
[15:08:42] * talismanick reassures himself that this isn't a mistake
[15:09:05] <wasamasa> I recall one incident where enriched text wasn't safe, this led to the release of 25.3
[15:09:19] <wasamasa> where a crafted email led to evaluating arbitrary code
[15:09:34] <talismanick> that's comforting
[15:09:41] <wasamasa> I'd worry more about some random emacs package doing more than it should
[15:10:07] <talismanick> What's your opinion of snitch.el?
[15:10:07] <wasamasa> because few people scrutinize that kind of stuff
[15:10:14] <wasamasa> it's cute
[15:10:21] <talismanick> Better than nothing?
[15:10:26] <wasamasa> yeah, pretty much
[15:10:34] <wasamasa> the thing is that a package can disable it just fine
[15:10:41] <talismanick> That's what I thought
[15:10:55] <talismanick> and hoping that they don't know about is security through obscurity
[15:11:00] <talismanick> which is apparently a no-no?
[15:11:11] <talismanick> I don't get security
[15:11:18] <wasamasa> it's a valid part of a strategy
[15:11:24] <wasamasa> but it shouldn't be your only strategy
[15:11:49] <greppy> most single solutions to things are probably bad, that's why defense in depth is a thing with security.
[15:11:56] <wasamasa> indeed
[15:11:58] <talismanick> I'm only slightly more sophisticated than people who accidentally switch their font to Wingdings and think they're getting hacked
[15:12:08] <wasamasa> these optimize for the common case of an attacker with limited time/skill
[15:12:21] <talismanick> or think an extension they haven't seen before is a virus
[15:13:12] <wasamasa> like, remember news about cases where someone hacked <important thing>, then just put a cryptocurrency miner on it?
[15:13:16] <greppy> and then there is my nephew that ended up with most of his files encrypted by ransomware *shakes head*
[15:13:49] <talismanick> "amongus fortnite sex mod token"
[15:13:59] <wasamasa> or in the case of twitters internal admin panel taking a beating, used that capability to make all the important twitter accounts advertise his cryptocurrency scam?
[15:14:14] <wasamasa> I find this rather mindboggling, but that's where we are
[15:14:41] <talismanick> wasamasa: yeah, I don't understand any of this and even I thought it was silly
[15:14:50] <wasamasa> you can do so much more with it
[15:14:52] <wasamasa> but they didn't
[15:15:25] <talismanick> What kind of weaponized savantry does it take to break through all of Twitter's defenses and think only of a harebrained scheme to push crypto?
[15:15:43] <wasamasa> it's about making money
[15:15:46] <talismanick> Actually, that sounds like the kind of person who would take the time to devise that and go through with it

[16:30:26] <bremner> I don't use use-package, so I can't advise there. I would be a bit surprised if the "C-x o" thing is directly related to use-package, but *shrug*, the world is weird sometimes
[16:32:34] <idontgetoutmuch> My knowledge of emacs is not enough for me to debug this
[16:32:55] <talismanick> idontgetoutmuch: So make the init proportionately clever
[16:33:07] <talismanick> I don't mean that as a putdown
[16:33:13] <idontgetoutmuch> use-package seems like a great idea but is above my pay grade
[16:33:26] <talismanick> I mean that I learned it the hard way from experience
[16:33:34] <talismanick> Although use-package makes it easier
[16:33:42] <talismanick> if you use it "the default way"
[16:34:14] <idontgetoutmuch> talismanick: I didn't think I was using it any other way than what is written in the instructions
[16:34:35] <talismanick> (e.g. remove the eval-when-compile and eat the increase in startup time)
[16:34:52] <talismanick> eat the loss in startup speed, I should say
[16:35:16] <talismanick> Also, don't quote your lambdas

[16:37:13] <idontgetoutmuch> Why is that?
[16:37:28] <talismanick> It's redundant
[16:37:42] <talismanick> the lambda already evals to its interior

[17:24:07] <GNUHacker> load time
[17:24:11] <krishna> bremner, I mean that when I use evil there is a lot of input lag and because of that the writing experiance is sluggish but with emacs bindings it is not present
[17:24:14] <GNUHacker> ye
[17:24:43] <bremner> krishna: I suspect the input lag is about escape detection. but someone who actually uses evil might know more
[17:25:19] <bremner> backleet: just FYI, we saw the question(s)
[17:25:37] <krishna> bremner, yep because of that I have been forced to dump vim like bindings for emacs bindings, but I am investigating that further

[17:28:24] <krishna> contrapunctus, yeah it could be because of flyspell and company also, but what I find peculiar is that in the lack of these bindings lag is not an issue
[17:28:33] <contrapunctus> krishna: I use boon myself, but be warned that its command set is not as rich as Evil. e.g. I haven't seen an equivalent of f/F/t/T, and the repeat command is buggy.

[20:37:34] <ruediger> no, the problem is that pcase creates the `let' statement. It creates a new n, which my code doesn't use.

[23:56:27] <kenran> I'm still having problems understanding aspects of gnus: do I understand "client-side mail splitting" correctly as that the the mails are still split on the server when using nnimap?
[23:56:59] <kenran> (I'm thinking of it as "mailboxes" in some other mua)

[23:58:42] <kenran> That is something that I do not really like (and it's also why I used to use notmuch).  Is there a way to separate mail in my INBOX only locally, even when using nnimap?
