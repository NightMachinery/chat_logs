[16:25:49] <klimi[m]> is rust really that great? i have my doubts
[16:26:10] <gtlsgamr> Sure
[16:26:16] <gtlsgamr> SurajKushwah[m]: Talk in pm
[16:26:40] <SurajKushwah[m]> gtlsgamr: You are not on telegram. what was your website.
[16:26:47] <SurajKushwah[m]> I need ur irc or whatever.
[16:27:11] <NeoVoid[m]> klimi[m]: I am no expert but it might thats why its earned it place wherever it is now.
[16:27:28] <gtlsgamr> gtlsgamr is the name on irc

[16:57:48] <smud[m]> <klimi[m]> "> <Neo Void> Rust takes a..." <- It has some really neat concepts. I like RAII and the borrow checker

[18:06:34] <gtlsgamr> http://peramid.es/independence.html
[18:33:45] <smud[m]> klimi: It does, but Rust makes it much more straightforward and intuitive to use. It actually enforces RAII on all resources by default
[18:41:00] <klimi[m]> won't it make slower?
[18:44:14] <smud[m]> Not sure if it's slower, in theory, isn't it the same as manual deallocation?

[19:20:21] <Arya[m]> @them
[19:20:36] <hemish[m]> understood
[19:20:46] <Arya[m]> from telegram to tag matrix or irc folks you need to just mention their username
[19:20:56] <Arya[m]> you cant add them in tg or discord bridges
[19:21:16] <hemish[m]> do all the chats remain saved in matrix unlike irc (chats are saved only when you are connected, and too locally)
[19:21:24] <Arya[m]> hemish[m]: yes
[19:21:31] <Arya[m]> matrix is more like telegram
[19:21:33] <Arya[m]> not irc
[19:21:36] <hemish[m]> ok
[19:23:32] <gtlsgamr> and irc is more like irc

[19:23:52] <Arya[m]> üòÜ
[19:24:36] <smud[m]> hemish[m]: To be fair you can set up a bouncer to save all chats :)
[19:25:10] <gtlsgamr> BOUNCER SUPREMACY!
[19:25:17] <gtlsgamr> but fr not saving the chats is good too
[19:25:29] <gtlsgamr> if you find something important, storing it at another place is a better idea
[19:25:39] <gtlsgamr> that way you can consolidate everything you like
