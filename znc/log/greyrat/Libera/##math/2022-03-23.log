[00:00:42] <twJizhan> hi
[00:01:12] <isekaijin> Z-module: Yeah, that's the issue, the ai are natural, not real.
[00:02:04] <twJizhan> what are you discussing now Z-module ? :-)

[00:02:40] <Z-module> twJizhan: a problem that isekaijin posed earlier
[00:02:43] <isekaijin> What I could do so far is this.
[00:03:31] <isekaijin> Let V = C^n and let E be the k-th exterior power of V. Then G = Gr(k, V) embeds into P = P(E) using the Plücker embedding. Moreover, G is a S^1-invariant subset of P.
[00:04:08] <isekaijin> Errr, I forgot to say that the linear action of S^1 on V naturally induces a linear action on E, hence on P.
[00:04:55] <isekaijin> Moreover, the action of S^1 on E is also of the same type as the action on V: it applies a weighted rotation to the individual coordinates.
[00:05:21] <isekaijin> Now, E's coordinates correspond to the coordinate k-planes in V.
[00:05:36] <isekaijin> And the weight on each coordinate k-plane is the sum of the weights on the individual coordinates.

[00:07:51] <isekaijin> So a k-plane is S^1-invariant if and only if its nonzero Plücker coordinates have all the same sum-of-weights.
[00:08:18] <isekaijin> But the problem is - can I say more than that?
[00:08:28] <isekaijin> All that I said so far was a series of trivialities.
[00:08:43] <twJizhan> i see that i can't even understand (these description of) this problem @.@
[00:10:42] <isekaijin> This is but the second exercise in Tu's “Introductory Lectures on Equivariant Cohomology”, and the fact that I can't finish solving it is utterly humiliating me.

[00:35:31] <Fangs> it makes sense, but if you used to naively think that 'logic' is enough to specify the integers, you might find it cursed

[01:22:39] <zeroc00l0> So, if an integer is both square free and not a prime then it's a Carmichael number?
[01:24:31] <Z-module> no
[01:24:47] <Z-module> but all Carmichael numbers are squarefree with at least three prime factors
[01:25:32] <int-e> 5^5 != 1 (mod 6)
[01:26:38] <Z-module> Thus 6 is not Carmichael
[01:27:30] <zeroc00l0> Right, but it is square-free.
[01:28:10] <Z-module> For n > 1 to be Carmichael means:  n not prime, and for all b coprime to n,  b^(n-1) = 1 (mod n)
[01:29:13] <Z-module> When n = 6, b = 5 (coprime to 6), we have b^(6-1) = 5^5 = 3125 = 5 (mod 6), so this n does not fit the definition of Carmichael.
[01:29:34] <zeroc00l0> Okay, that makes sense to me.
[01:29:55] <Z-module> It *turns out* that all Carmichael numbers are squarefree and have at least three prime factors, but that's not a thing that defines them.

[01:47:43] <Z-module> It comes down to: each numerator summand   1*2*...*<k>*...*(p-1)    where <k> means k is missing from the product, must be the inverse of -k in the field Z/pZ, since the full product (p-1)! = -1  in that field.

[01:59:38] <Z-module> saying  a = b (mod p)   in Z  keeps a, b as distinct objects.  Their images in Z/pZ are the exact same object.
[02:00:14] <Z-module> it's not radically different, but you have to be careful about it in some reasoning
[02:00:22] <zeroc00l0> Because the elements of Z/pZ are congruence classes.

[02:02:16] <Z-module> If you like, sure.  The precise *realization* of Z/pZ doesn't ahve to be congruence classes in Z, there are other ways to build it. But all we need here is that the nonzero things in Z/pZ form a multiplicative group, and their product in this group is -1 in this group (the additive inverse of the multiplicative identity) -- Wilson, in other words.
[02:02:19] <int-e> (the coset view is useful)
[02:02:47] <Z-module> I should have said, -1 in this field
[02:04:01] <Z-module> Taking off now... have fun.
[02:04:26] <zeroc00l0> Oh interesting, Wilson is saying that the product of the units is congruent to -1 (mod p).
[02:04:41] <zeroc00l0> Thanks for the help.
[02:05:22] <Z-module> again, in the field Z/pZ itself, there is no "congruent (mod p)".  It's just equality.
[02:05:58] <zeroc00l0> Right, yeah.
[02:06:08] <Z-module> In the *group*  (Z/pZ)^*,  where -1 is the same object as p-1,  the product of all the elments *is* that object -1.

[02:10:24] <Z-module> This generalizes to:  If A is finite abelian group having a unique element g of order 2, then the sum of everything in A is g.   In the finite abelian group (Z/pZ)^*, for odd prime p, the element -1, a.k.a. p - 1,  is the unique element of order 2 (and "sum" here means product if you regard being inside the ring Z/pZ )

[12:30:25] <PlanckWalk> x^3 is (up to a constant factor) the derivative of 1+x^4
[12:31:21] <mikoto-chan> the way I learned to do it is by replacing part of the formula with something that I can take differentiate
[12:31:32] <mikoto-chan> PlanckWalk: I know that much
[12:31:38] <mikoto-chan> https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/integration-by-substitution.html
[12:31:57] <mikoto-chan> and this tutorial seems to be using the same method
[12:32:39] <PlanckWalk> Yep.. g(x) = 1+x^4
[12:33:29] <mikoto-chan> ohhhh, now I get it, thank you
[12:33:46] <PlanckWalk> The only quirk being that you're missing the factor of 3 in the derivative
[12:34:00] <PlanckWalk> But integrals are linear so you can deal with that easily
[12:34:38] <PlanckWalk> Integral x^3 f(1+x^4) dx = (1/3) Integral 3 x^3 f(1+x^4) dx
[12:34:51] <PlanckWalk> Err, 4 not 3
[12:35:50] <mikoto-chan> uhmmm, which 4 do I replace?

[13:56:10] <velix> #R is dead, #math is dead.
[13:56:36] <int-e> The quartiles are just wrong though? Out of 10 numbers, it's picking the 4th and 7th... instead of (2nd or 3rd, or an average thereof) and (8th or 9th, or an average thereof)

[13:57:42] <velix> In R and PostgreSQL you can set "continious" or "discontinous" when calculating quartiles.

[16:01:56] <Franciman> then in your field
[16:02:01] <Franciman> dividing by b and b^2 is the same
[16:02:23] <Franciman> so it may have been a good bet
[16:02:25] <Franciman> to use b

[16:02:34] <Franciman> but in this case
[16:02:36] <Franciman> you are not sure at all
[16:02:40] <Franciman> so better use the safe bet

[16:05:30] <Franciman> because you know that b is a solution of the equation

[16:25:20] <Franciman> propose a solution
[16:25:22] <Franciman> and we can discuss it
[16:25:36] <cadmio> my idea is to split x^2 +x(b+1)+b^2+b
[16:26:09] <Franciman> i'm saying this, because if you keep asking what to do next, it means you haven't clearly understood some parts yet (which again is totally normal, but the solution is simply to go back to read or ask related questions)

[16:26:19] <Franciman> first of all are we sure this is the correct solution?
[16:26:38] <Franciman> sorry i mean the correct result of the division
[16:26:48] <Franciman> do you know how to verify this?
[16:27:08] <cadmio> the poly has 3 roots we know 'b' is one so there must be other two and x^2 +x(b+1)+b^2+b must split
[16:27:32] <Franciman> do you expect it to split in Z_2[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + 1) ?
[16:27:34] <cadmio> otherwise is not a splitting-field
[16:27:49] <cadmio> we're verifying it
[16:28:19] <Franciman> so what you're telling me is that we want to verify if your field contains roots of x^2 + x(b+1)+b^2+b
[16:28:21] <Franciman> right?

[16:48:31] <Franciman> exactly
[16:48:35] <Franciman> so what was the problem?
[16:48:38] <Franciman> that there was a miscalculation
[16:48:44] <Franciman> you must take into account that this can happen
[16:48:50] <Franciman> and check your computations if you get stuck
[16:49:05] <Franciman> so you have two roots, do we have a third one?
[16:49:36] <Franciman> for second degree equations i remember there was some theory
[16:49:44] <Franciman> ah ofc it's even simpler
[16:49:51] <cadmio> you're great!
[16:50:25] <Franciman> let's finish this thing off
[16:50:27] <Franciman> let's go
[16:51:06] <cadmio> but at this point it's clear that we could also brute froce the original p(x)
[16:51:43] <cadmio> now we've to check 1+a, a + a^2 and 1+a+a^2
[16:52:26] <mh_le> cadmio: you only said it had to do with computational complexity :)
[16:53:34] <Franciman> cadmio: do we have an answer?
[16:53:52] <Franciman> you either brute force
[16:53:55] <Franciman> or do a division
[16:53:56] <cadmio> mh_le: An algorithm is said to be an exponential algorithm, if the number of bit operations required to execute the algorithm on integers of binary length smaller than or
[16:53:58] <cadmio> equal to k is the same order as e^(ck), for some c > 0
[16:54:00] <Franciman> maybe doing a division is simpler
[16:54:06] <Franciman> because it's a second degree equation

[16:55:41] <mh_le> cadmio: I know what an exponential algorithm is, I don't know what "exponential improvement" is
[16:55:59] <Franciman> hm i did something wrong lol
[16:56:18] <Franciman> ah yes, i didn't report the correct polynomial
[16:56:23] <Franciman> but ok in this way you find a decomposition
[16:56:26] <Franciman> there is an even simpler way
[16:56:53] <Franciman> (x - a^2)(x - y) = x^2 - xa^2 - xy + ya^2
[16:57:09] <Franciman> this must be x^2 + x(a+1) + a^2 + a
[16:57:25] <Franciman> so a^2 - y = a + 1
[16:57:31] <Franciman> ya^2 = a^2 + a
[16:57:36] <Franciman> not so simpler LOL

[17:00:06] <Franciman> x^2 + x(b+1)+b^2+b = (x - b^2)(x-g)

[17:01:25] <Franciman> so you must check that, (b+1) = - g - b^2
