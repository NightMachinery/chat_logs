[02:45:51] <themaddwabbit> So I'm trying to set up a lab for penetration testing but I'm having a hard time understanding how to set it up properly - in terms of making sure the test environment is actually separate from the rest of the network and my home devices
[02:46:56] <onelegend> put your lab in a separate VLAN
[02:47:06] <onelegend> what router are you using?
[02:47:26] <themaddwabbit> its a nighthawk brand
[02:47:55] <themaddwabbit> Can I really separate the lab from my home network? from the router through a vlan?
[02:49:30] <themaddwabbit> or would I have to get a separate router or something... Maybe I'm overthinking it.
[02:49:55] <onelegend> themaddwabbit: yes, you can separate your lab and your home network through VLANs
[02:49:59] <onelegend> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN
[02:51:49] <onelegend> It splits a single network into multiple isolated networks
[02:53:09] <themaddwabbit> I see, so what I'm needing is a vlan to make sure its separate. and I can likely do this from the router. thank you.

[14:57:15] <euouae> In public?
[14:58:01] <euouae> well, you're still here, so the answer is no

[14:59:06] <euouae> I'd know my place too if I were in China under the threat of getting imprisoned for speaking out my mind
[14:59:16] <jm18> your assumption that anyone who criticises the government is a little concerning though. you shouldn't believe everything you see on tv

[17:21:12] <piou> keeps stimulating you by providing a wide variety of challenges on a regular basis then moving toward web could very well hit that spot since it's much less common to be able to use a known technique directly, you need to spend a lot of time understanding the target rather than applying a procedure (hence why I really disagree with people viewing OSCP as the holy graal of offensive security).

[17:21:41] <piou> operational: that said, sure, moving toward defense is also a career move
[17:23:01] <operational> feels like i should do one or the other at this point
[17:24:09] <[iz]> nothing wrong w/ doing both
[17:24:30] <operational> coming up on 15 years in the industry. maybe time for a leadership role in defensive infosec
[17:24:40] <operational> but also hacking is so much fun
[17:24:56] <operational> i mean don't get me wrong, we still get in and get domain admin a heck of a lot
[17:25:06] <operational> but i think the writing may be on the wall for that kind of work
[17:25:11] <[iz]> very few employers are going to consider more diverse security experience as a negative
[17:25:19] <operational> fair point
[17:25:31] <operational> and it's a huge gap in my experience

[17:26:27] <[iz]> yeah, just try a bit of everything, imho... employers like security ppl that can do it all   (cuz it means they can get away w/ hiring fewer security ppl :b)
[17:26:38] <piou> Also we're in the golden age of bug bounty: if you choose to take a less offensive position it doesn't mean you can't have your fun also (even though BB mostly means web or mobile).

[17:26:56] <[iz]> yeah, what piou said.. no need to pick one or the other
[17:30:10] <piou> But as for the future of the field... Do I expect that we'll need less and less infra pentesters? Sure, I do. Just as we need less and less people able to reverse engineer file formats or network protocols since many are just standardized or using web instead. That's just how things go, but we'll still need those people and we'll still need pentesters overall.
