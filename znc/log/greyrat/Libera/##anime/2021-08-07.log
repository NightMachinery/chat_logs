[06:05:34] <amigojapan> Listener-san is common Japanese

[06:22:12] <ButterNoodle> and they feel like they are gonna fall over
[06:22:16] <ButterNoodle> I kinda want a grom
[06:22:18] <Sadale> amigojapan, I'm not sure if the live stream just contains the opening or if it'd mirror the content of, says, my youtube video during my timeslot.
[06:22:19] <ButterNoodle> ngl
[06:22:32] <ButterNoodle> aint paying 3k for one
[06:22:51] <MootPoot> But ended up spending the majority of my time on a 250cc dual Sport

[06:26:16] <ButterNoodle> big delay before they go
[06:26:39] <MootPoot> Got bonked for having erratic throttle by the instructor
[06:26:55] <MootPoot> I thought I was a Baka desu
[06:26:55] <ButterNoodle> u know
[06:27:02] <MootPoot> Then tried the Grom 
[06:27:10] <MootPoot> And Honda rebel
[06:27:11] <ButterNoodle> the concours feels like it turns tighter than the ktm
[06:27:52] <MootPoot> So much easier
[06:28:19] <MootPoot> Although I don't like their seating but the throttle is much easier to control.. smoother
[06:29:23] <ButterNoodle> u use ur rt index finger to cover the front brake?
[06:29:42] <MootPoot> No
[06:29:47] <ButterNoodle> do that
[06:29:53] <MootPoot> They told me full finger grip 
[06:29:57] <ButterNoodle> and you can leverage that for better throttle control
[06:30:02] <ButterNoodle> ig
[06:30:06] <ButterNoodle> I never do
[06:30:29] <ButterNoodle> unless its a dogshit throttle thats like a 3/4 pull
[06:30:44] <ButterNoodle> the ktm is like 3/8-1/2 pull
[06:31:00] <ButterNoodle> I have to use that method or I am on one wheel all the time
[06:31:08] <ButterNoodle> unintentionally
[06:31:09] <MootPoot> Something like 1-2 finger is cool but when you're not expecting to need to stop suddenly due to cars, ppl etc, but on track or MX use as many fingers as you want
[06:31:18] <MootPoot> That's what they said
[06:31:35] <ButterNoodle> I cover w 1 and hard stop w 2
[06:32:00] <ButterNoodle> 1 finger and a lot of adrenaline will still stoppie in an oh-shit moment
[06:32:20] <ButterNoodle> *for most dual rotored bikes
[06:32:26] <MootPoot> But now i know

[06:32:57] <ButterNoodle> adv has dual
[06:32:59] <MootPoot> I hate the seating on all the others

[06:38:15] <amigojapan> MootPoot: batteries stop working in extreme cold?
[06:41:50] <Nanobot> I'm watching some of the HoloJP members' first reactions to HoloEN from when they first debuted. Everyone's like, "They're all so good at Japanese! They all can draw really well! They all can sing, too!" Poor Ame...
[06:43:19] <Nanobot> If the next HoloEN group doesn't have at least one member who's fluent in Spanish, I'm dumping my Cover stock.
[06:44:30] <MootPoot> amigojapan: They can stop working or have much less available charge and voltage
[06:44:38] <MootPoot> Depends on the battery
[06:45:07] <amigojapan> I see MootPoot 
[06:49:03] <amigojapan> MootPoot: also I have not tried it for 10 years but I have found a charged battery after like a year and it was still charged
[06:50:43] <amigojapan> Nanobot: hololive ES! It seems they are not even trying to make it real
[06:52:15] <Nanobot> They should start with a bridge. Someone who can appeal to two languages, like a Coco or a Kiara, but who can speak Spanish. The market is definitely there; Cover just needs to make the first step.
[06:52:43] <amigojapan> I see Nanobot 
[06:53:17] <amigojapan> Nanobot: there are already Spanish speaking people that watch hololive
[06:54:00] <amigojapan> I often see superchat sent in mxn
[06:54:17] <Nanobot> Yeah, but I'm not sure Cover is convinced it's worth the risk of opening up a whole Spanish branch just yet. That's why I think they should start with one person who can speak Spanish without 100% relying on a Spanish-speaking audience.
[06:54:37] <ButterNoodle> I have to poop soon
[06:54:56] <amigojapan> I see Nanobot

[06:57:05] <ButterNoodle> you shouldnt put a 2500 dollar suspension kit on a 3500 dollar motorbike

[09:16:27] <amigojapan> Hi ButterNoodle 
[09:16:42] <ButterNoodle> yo amigojapan
[09:17:17] <amigojapan> Omega037: was it you who said that mainframes had solved problems like buffer overflow in the 70s?
[09:17:25] <ButterNoodle> wut
[09:18:10] <ButterNoodle> lol my new pcard for work says it has a 1$ limit
[09:18:14] <amigojapan> Someone said that but I don't remember clearly who it was ButterNoodle 
[09:18:28] <ButterNoodle> I can buy a used ink pen for that
[09:19:09] <ButterNoodle> buffer overflows seem like a fundamental issue with moving data around in memory registers tho
[09:19:42] <rando25892> some people make playdoo look like desserts or an art pallette
[09:19:48] *** Joins: mero (uid94492@id-94492.tooting.irccloud.com)
[09:20:07] <ButterNoodle> amigojapan: and overflows are a problem specific to the code
[09:20:10] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I think the Harvard architecture may have solved that cause it kept program memory and data memory separate
[09:20:48] <ButterNoodle> that just means that overflows dont kill that program, it would still corrupt the dataset
[09:21:38] <ButterNoodle> I mean ig the thought may have been around languages like cobol that dont use dma
[09:21:40] <amigojapan> Right. But it would not have buffer overflow hacker attack
[09:21:51] <ButterNoodle> but java and python dont either
[09:22:13] <ButterNoodle> ahh related to security
[09:23:02] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: the theoretically don't, but they could have one that is not discovered. And we will widely used C programs
[09:23:20] <amigojapan> Yup security
[09:24:30] <rando25892> maybe thats why local universities will offer free consultation to teach a person if they contact them
[09:24:47] <rando25892> or at least if your U has supercomputers
[09:27:13] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: but Von Newman architecture won it early on and now we are stuck with it
[09:32:16] <ButterNoodle> use pascal or fortran.. security though obscurity...
[09:32:32] <ButterNoodle> but I think even in 2021 people learn to code some of this
[09:32:58] <ButterNoodle> banks still run some of this old code because it works
[09:38:05] <amigojapan> And COBOL still runs
[09:38:19] <jessedesu2> The keyword is overflow
[09:38:21] <amigojapan> COBOL coding is high pay

[10:15:11] <amigojapan> emmeka: I don't know how they thought they could win a war against a force like the UK
[10:15:33] <emmeka> well, the initial invasion was successful, I think. Argentina did seize the entire island chain.
[10:15:49] <amigojapan> I see
[10:15:57] <jessedesu2> Taiwan is next
[10:15:59] <emmeka> then Brits collectively spat out their tea and sent an entire expeditionary force

[10:19:03] <jessedesu2> Effectively a generation ahead
[10:20:08] <emmeka> Argentinian Navy was still using like WW2 era warships too, which they'd bought as surplus from the Americans. The Brits brought a fleet of modern nuclear subs.
[10:20:44] <emmeka> not that they didn't manage to embarrass the Brits despite this, iirc the Argentinians managed to sink a few British warships

[18:42:08] <DunceCotus> Bco1981 yeah that's realistic.. for chicks without bras
[18:42:48] <isekaijin> To the point that when I am with friends, and we run into a 3D girl whom they think is pretty, it does not even register with me. Just another random person in the background.

[18:43:41] <DunceCotus> amigojapan its not about what I want

[18:44:53] <DunceCotus> but the faces look.. odd

[21:36:03] <amigojapan> Ok going afk
[21:37:05] <Nanobot> I'm having an existential crisis. I could have SWORN that the way compasses in Minecraft have always worked is that they point to your personal respawn point (for example, if you used a bed, it'll point to the bed). I had no doubt in my mind about that. I feel like I've used it for that and personally confirmed it many times over the years. But now, it doesn't do that; it always points to the world spawn. And the wiki says it's always only pointed to the 
[21:37:05] <Nanobot> world spawn. And a Google search says that it's always pointed to the world spawn. And now, I feel like I'm going insane.
[21:38:44] <TsundereNoises> Nanobot: my only understanding of how compasses work is from hololive videos, so I never thought they did anything
[21:39:52] <Nanobot> They don't do anything particularly useful if you know how to use F3 and coordinates. However, I created a world where I deliberately turned off the F3 debug info in order to force myself to do things the hard way.

[22:31:25] <Vohveli> TsundereNoises: it's a challenge where one player tries to beat Minecraft while others try to kill him first
[22:31:26] <SpiritOfSummer> at the end of the day, there exists 2 things.
[22:31:32] <SpiritOfSummer> service, and talent.
[22:31:45] <SpiritOfSummer> sometimes, a product exists as a service to the consumer, purchased as needed or merely desired.
[22:31:51] <SpiritOfSummer> then, there exists the passionate ones
[22:31:53] <Vohveli> the hunters each get a compass that's modded to point to the player
[22:32:07] <SpiritOfSummer> who can look at any one product, no matter how obscure, as some sort of performance of talent, a work of art, if you will
[22:32:24] <SpiritOfSummer> and those who don't see the value in observing these strives are perfectly fine with that
[22:32:28] <ButterNoodle> SpiritOfSummer: yes, like paying $40 a lb for coffee from a local craft microroastary
[22:32:30] <TsundereNoises> Vohveli: oh, that's pretty neat
