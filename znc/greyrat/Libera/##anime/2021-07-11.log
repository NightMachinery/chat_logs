[06:55:37] <amigojapan> Hi everyone
[06:56:47] <amigojapan> We lost a lot when computers stopped being about programming and started being about office
[06:57:23] <mathu> amigojapan: when would you say that was? my mom was an office worker using computers for word processing and whatall in the 80s
[06:57:33] <MootPoot> amigojapan:  go drink water
[06:58:30] <amigojapan> mathu: I would say it was when basic stopped being os and specially when GUI took over
[06:58:52] <amigojapan> MootPoot: I'll drink some tea
[07:00:49] <amigojapan> mathu: nowadays maybe we should develop a new desktop that is more about project collaboration like git. But not as hard to use as git. And that should be the default desktop I think

[07:12:43] <amigojapan> mathu: and that should show as the main desktop. Not apps or files and folders like now
[07:13:08] <mathu> interesting idea

[08:30:14] <amigojapan> How would it be reduced to 2 messages?
[08:30:45] <MootPoot> if you want to search a quote and what you want shows up on the 3rd quote for example
[08:30:47] <amigojapan> You would have it concatenate everything?
[08:31:12] <MootPoot> normally you would have to do !searchquote, then 2 !more's and you'd get 3 quote messages
[08:31:31] <MootPoot> with this way you'd just have them concatinated into one string with dividers like |||
[08:31:35] <MootPoot> so only 2 messages
[08:32:13] <amigojapan> I see. But there is also a limit to message length

[12:08:39] <Nanobot> Sadale: I'm not going to retire until I've actually completed the trades.
[12:08:45] <Sadale> doesn't matter. I don't intend to live lavishly after I retire.
[12:08:49] <Nanobot> I don't have the money until I have it.
[12:08:52] <MootPoot> well
[12:08:53] <Sadale> true
[12:08:58] <Sadale> Nanobot, good luck! :-)
[12:08:59] <MootPoot> either way, good for you lad Nanobot  
[12:09:05] <MootPoot> you've earned it
[12:09:24] <MootPoot> with that extra money could you get that back surgery?
[12:09:25] <MootPoot> or no luck
[12:09:29] <Sadale> plus BTC luck. He's one of those early buyers.
[12:09:58] <Nanobot> MootPoot: I don't want back surgery. Back surgery would mean that I won't be able to bend anymore. Yes, I'll be able to afford it, but I don't want it.
[12:10:17] <Nanobot> I didn't buy early. I started buying Bitcoin at the end of the 2013 bubble.
[12:10:20] <MootPoot> is that the only way surgery can help?
[12:10:33] <Nanobot> MootPoot: That's the only surgery that exists for this right now.
[12:10:43] <theholyduck> like spinal fusion surgery or whatever its called?
[12:10:46] <Sadale> ah. That's not so early. STill earlier than me
[12:10:48] <Nanobot> theholyduck: Yeah.
[12:10:57] <Sadale> Nanobot, if you wouldn't mind me to ask, how old are you right now?
[12:10:57] <MootPoot> can they join it in multiples?
[12:11:03] <MootPoot> like 2 or 3 sections 
[12:11:06] <Nanobot> Fusion is a dumb name for it. It's literally nailing metal bars to the spine to keep it rigid.
[12:11:08] <MootPoot> so you can bend a little
[12:11:15] <Nanobot> Sadale: Almost 35.
[12:11:37] <Sadale> Nanobot, damn that's even younger than my planned retirement age. Mine's 40.
[12:11:44] <Nanobot> MootPoot: With fusion, you end up having new problems at the edges of where it's braced.
[12:12:10] <Nanobot> The surgeon made it clear that fusion is kind of a last resort thing if you really can't live without it.
[12:12:35] <MootPoot> we can rebuild him
[12:12:52] <Sadale> Nanobot, In fact you're far youger than I thought. I thought that you were 40~50
[12:13:05] <Nanobot> No, I only feel that old.
[12:13:11] <MootPoot> Nanobot:  is it just the pain thats a problem or are there other issues as well
[12:13:16] <MootPoot> can you just ask them to like
[12:13:22] <MootPoot> kill the pain nerves there
[12:13:24] <MootPoot> ?
[12:13:42] <Nanobot> MootPoot: For the most part, it means I can't sit at a computer all day long, and have to go lie down from time to time.
[12:13:55] <Nanobot> MootPoot: Well, that's kind of what they did last time.
[12:14:05] <Nanobot> They cut out part of a disc so that it wouldn't make contact with a nerve.
[12:15:53] <JesseDesu> what
[12:16:04] <JesseDesu> who's getting spinal surgery
[12:16:17] <Nanobot> I got spinal surgery several years ago.
[12:17:05] <JesseDesu> oh
[12:17:08] <JesseDesu> you lived
[12:17:17] <Nanobot> I think so
[12:18:24] <ButterNoodle> did it work Nanobot?
[12:18:33] <ButterNoodle> any relief from surgery?
[12:19:12] <Nanobot> Before the surgery, I had a major limp and sharp pain in every step. That's all gone now. But I still have issues with my back, and it usually just manifests as pain in the back itself now.
[12:20:27] <Nanobot> I get bulging discs sometimes (in various discs) and deal with them on a case-by-case basis, but I haven't had one in a few years now.
[12:20:42] <Nanobot> (at least, not since I got this chair)
[12:20:58] <ButterNoodle> after my motorcycle wreck the sciatic nerve was being pinched between l4-5
[12:21:11] <Nanobot> Mine was l5-s1
[12:21:23] <ButterNoodle> bulging disc on mine...
[12:21:33] <MootPoot> I got off a plane and I've been having siatic issues ever since
[12:21:46] <MootPoot> Asked doc and he was like
[12:21:48] <MootPoot> Meh
[12:21:57] * MootPoot shrugs
[12:22:02] <MootPoot> I'd like it to go away
[12:22:05] <ButterNoodle> had some neuropathy in my left leg.. hot shit felt cold.. cold shit felt hot.. constant pins and needles
[12:22:36] <Nanobot> I started havingt the sciatic pain after a trip to Disneyland, but I was already having discomfort in my back for a couple of years before that.
[12:22:44] <ButterNoodle> sitting in a car for more than 30 min was terrible
[12:23:10] <ButterNoodle> I hope u get some relief some how Nanobot... that shit is terrible
[12:23:37] <Nanobot> I did get relief. My situation now is so much better than it was before the surgery. But the reality is it'll never be 100% better.
[12:23:44] <ButterNoodle> yep..
[12:23:54] <ButterNoodle> I lost all the weight to help with mine
[12:23:58] <ButterNoodle> *did help
[12:24:12] <ButterNoodle> but recently shit has been hurting again... weather pains
[12:24:31] <Nanobot> I lived with *constant* sciatic pain for over 5 years. The issues that was causing that don't just go away.
[12:24:32] <ButterNoodle> dont let anyone tell u weather changes dont cause that stuff to hurt
[12:24:42] <treeman5> lol
[12:24:54] <Nanobot> Weather changes absolutely cause pain like that.
[12:25:01] <ButterNoodle> yep
[12:25:04] <MootPoot> Really
[12:25:06] <Nanobot> I think it has something to do with atmospheric pressure.
[12:25:07] <MootPoot> Huh
[12:25:19] <ButterNoodle> freaky weather here
[12:25:23] <MootPoot> I thought it was just an excuse for dressing light
[12:25:26] <ButterNoodle> barometer has been yoyo-in
[12:25:49] <Nanobot> But yeah, in the days leading up to rain, I have pain in my back and right wrist (which I broke as a kid).
[12:25:51] <ButterNoodle> my sciatica has been tring to kill me
[12:26:07] <MootPoot> My Mazda's ecu has some source of air pressure sensor every time there's a storm fuel range skyrockets up and down
[12:26:09] <Nanobot> Once the rain starts, the pain goes away.

[14:19:09] <Katrin> NoPanties: They use relative poverty to see how much you need to cover yourself.
[14:19:11] <NoPanties> that would mean being poor isn't that bad at all
[14:19:18] <Katrin> Oh it is
[14:19:32] <Sumida> NoPanties: I think you asked about some aquarium some days ago? and no, I don't know all of them
[14:19:45] <Katrin> In the USA there's hardly any social security nets that'll pay your rent when you're unable to work.

[14:20:11] <Sumida> there just happens to be one in Sumida
[14:20:30] <NoPanties> Katrin: one can buy a tent and live in the streets
[14:20:43] <Katrin> NoPanties: That is illegal though
[14:20:45] <Katrin> xD
[14:20:51] <NoPanties> no way

[14:20:58] <NoPanties> then why do so many people do it?

[14:21:26] <NoPanties> damn
[14:21:42] <Katrin> There are places where it is legal to camp for free, but those are far away from civilisation
[14:21:49] <Katrin> So it's not really feasable living there

[14:22:54] <Katrin> Here in Germany things are a tad bit differen't
[14:22:55] <NoPanties> Japan has no homeless people
[14:23:06] <NoPanties> how does Japan do that?
[14:23:06] <Katrin> NoPanties: that's not quite true
[14:23:15] <Katrin> They are mostly invisible to society
[14:23:22] <Katrin> Many stay with friends
[14:23:33] <Katrin> NoPanties: homlessness does not always equal sleeping in the streets.
[14:23:34] <Sumida> it's not wild. they focus super strongly on the individual, not the group or community
[14:23:45] <Sumida> japan is quite the opposite
[14:23:50] <Katrin> It just means not having a legal adress, but that comes with many consequences
[14:24:04] <Katrin> Like being unable to open a bank account and other things.
[14:24:17] <NoPanties> your friend can't be a legal address for you?
[14:24:19] <Katrin> NoPanties: But Japan also has a good social security system.
[14:24:57] <Katrin> NoPanties: I don't know all the details of Japanese law there. In Germany it can be problematic in regards to benefits for your friend.
[14:25:14] <Katrin> If you house a homeless friend they might not be eligable for state support anymore depending on your income.
[14:25:22] <Katrin> If you register them
[14:25:40] <Katrin> If they are not registered they can still collect their monthly state money.
[14:25:46] <Katrin> That is how it's in Germany
[14:26:06] <Katrin> From what I know Germany and Japan have a similar system.
[14:26:07] <NoPanties> but if they get money, they can have a home... no?
[14:26:23] <Katrin> But Japan seems to be better at reintigration efforts for the unemployed.
[14:26:31] <Katrin> NoPanties: no
[14:26:39] <Katrin> There are not enough cheap homes to go around
[14:26:54] <Katrin> If housing is too expensive, the state does not cover it
[14:27:14] <Katrin> So you have to move to a less expensive place
[14:27:18] <NoPanties> could building tent cities solve the problem?
[14:27:23] <Katrin> which also reduces your chances at landing a job.
[14:27:33] <Katrin> NoPanties: I do not think so
[14:27:51] <Katrin> It causes lots of problems when you let people live that closely together with little privacy.
[14:27:51] <NoPanties> I forgot that it's rather cold in winter in Germany
[14:28:14] <NoPanties> you would freeze to death

[14:33:53] <theholyduck> a house thats older than 30 years is basicly only fit to be torn down and a new one built

[14:40:18] <theholyduck> NoPanties: thats some norwegian skyscrapers right there
[14:40:44] <NoPanties> theholyduck: did you know that Oslo has a metro? I did not know that
[14:40:54] <theholyduck> NoPanties: :P oslo like most european cities is like made up of like mostly 4-5 story buildings. 
[14:40:54] <Katrin> theholyduck: and lying about being trans would get me the wrong kind of HRT, it's stupid but cis women get birthcontrol as HRT
[14:41:02] <theholyduck> NoPanties: oslo is like about as densly populated as berlin if memory serves
[14:41:06] <theholyduck> berlin is just larger
[14:41:13] <NoPanties> wow
[14:41:37] <theholyduck> NoPanties: so yes we have a subway. + trams + busses + national trains in tunnels under the city
[14:41:41] <Katrin> theholyduck: not that I would even need access to the medical system like that
[14:41:48] <theholyduck> + the motorway is also underground in a lot of oslo
[14:41:50] <Katrin> I can always source estrogen from different places
[14:42:03] <Katrin> Worst case I have to set up a lab and go the synthetic route.
[14:42:37] <Katrin> Which I should like do in general, who knows if HRT will still be legal in a decade.
[14:43:19] <Katrin> theholyduck: the nazis are at it again in Germany, we're still a good way from them seizing power, but a decade can change a lot.

[14:44:13] <Katrin> We are headed for dark days
[14:44:15] <NoPanties> theholyduck: so, there are not common in Norway
[14:44:19] <Katrin> theholyduck: but is the left divided
[14:44:23] <theholyduck> + the super right wing party fucked themselfs in the last goverment :P 
[14:44:38] <Katrin> theholyduck: here the political left is divided too much to form a government coalition.
[14:44:56] <theholyduck> Katrin:  basicly the goverment decided to bring back some norwegian citizen woman who had gone of to syria and joined isis and had kids there. and bring back her kids. and then put her on terrorism trial
[14:45:00] <theholyduck> and the right wing party was like
[14:45:01] <Katrin> The social democrats are still not willing to work with the left party
[14:45:02] <theholyduck> UNACCEPTABLE 
[14:45:13] <theholyduck> BRINGING THEM BACK TO NORWAY AND PUTTING THEM ON TRIAL IS UNACCEPTABLE
[14:45:24] <theholyduck> WE SHOULD LEAVE THEM TO DIE IN SYRIAAA
[14:45:28] <theholyduck> and so they left the goverment
[14:45:34] <Katrin> Eh
[14:45:40] <Katrin> They be pissed 
[14:45:43] <Katrin> me likes
[14:46:01] <theholyduck> Katrin: and since then they sort of faded into insignficiance
[14:46:01] <Katrin> theholyduck: norway sounds neat, but tbh I couldn't deal with the winters.
[14:46:09] <Katrin> Or the summer
[14:46:11] <ntdll> theholyduck: I can confirm the accuracy of this
[14:46:22] <theholyduck> helped by the fact that one of their political members wife faked left wing attack
[14:46:25] <theholyduck> on their house
[14:46:36] <theholyduck> because a play she didnt like called her husband a racist

[14:49:26] <theholyduck> just near me theres farmers growing cabbages and carrots and onions and barley
[14:49:29] <Katrin> I am generally looking for places to escape to long term
[14:49:29] <theholyduck> and potatoesss
[14:49:41] <Katrin> Like, I really want to get out of Germany long term, the system here is trash.
[14:50:00] <Katrin> I want to move to a country that actually holds law enforcement accountable for their acctions.
[14:50:12] <Katrin> I want to live in a place that is not just democracy by name
[14:50:30] <Katrin> or rather, not a place where the government constantly creates laws that are later sacked by the highest court.
[14:50:37] <Katrin> Germany is so obnoxious about this
[14:50:44] <Katrin> I mean yeah it is cool that the court works and all
[14:51:01] <Katrin> but the illegal laws are still enforced for a few years before anything happens.

[18:28:34] <snake> MootPoot, i disagree with your feature suggestion for ImoutoBot 
[18:28:41] <snake> lets not make the bot too complicated
[18:28:55] <NoPanties> does china know what sushi is?
[18:28:57] <snake> i dislike bots that use numbered codes or count parameters
[18:29:37] <amigojapan> NoPanties: most countries don't really
[18:29:41] <snake> err commands i suppose
[18:29:50] <MootPoot> ...
[18:29:57] <MootPoot> You literally just used it though 
[18:30:01] <NoPanties> so, japan has a monopoly on sushi?
[18:30:20] <snake> like k5 is a good bot, but i dislike the numbered choices even tho technically it works
[18:30:28] <snake> it took me a while to get it actually
[18:30:47] <Bco1981> MootPoot: it's not time that makes the shadow, it's another object. still at night on the ground, there is no shadow without any other object above it.
[18:30:54] <snake> MootPoot, i don't think an id number counts as a numbered code/choice
[18:31:06] <amigojapan> NoPanties: Japan does not usually eat sushi rolls but that is what most countries know
[18:31:08] <snake> MootPoot, although your suggestion was for a count parameter
[18:31:12] <snake> i also don't like that
[18:31:39] <MootPoot> Bco1981: But it's time passing that allows the the objects to move in a manner that creates shadows

[19:02:12] <Nanobot> That's what Hololive was all about at first. Tokino Sora was introduced just to be a mascot for the software.
