[00:25:53] <mawk> can you remind me of your question Simplar ?
[00:26:02] <Simplar>  An archer attempts to hit five targets. When a target is hit, an archer proceeds to the next one. What is the probability to hit exactly three targets, if an archer has maximum of two arrows per target, and the probability to hit a target is equal to 0.5?
[00:26:18] <mawk> I see
[00:26:59] <mawk> he hits three targets if he fails 2 of them, so if he spends 2 arrows on 2 targets and misses everytime
[00:27:08] <mawk> so 0.5^4 ?
[00:27:32] <mawk> yeah no
[00:28:05] <Simplar> The probability to hit a target with two arrows is 3/4. The probability to miss a target twice is 1/4.
[00:28:27] <Simplar> So hitting any of 3 targets has a probability of (3/4)^3*(1/4)^2
[00:28:37] <Simplar> any 3 out of 5
[00:29:14] <Simplar> Why isn't that the complete answer according to qergle, idk
[00:29:17] <mawk> he could use 1 arrow, or 2 arrow, to successfully hit the 3 targets
[00:29:25] <mawk> so why do you say it's always 3/4
[00:29:39] <Simplar> Four cases are possible with two arrows
[00:29:53] <LTCD> riv So for the bottom part:   7x+4 = 0 mod 5. 2x+4 = 0 mod 5. 2x= -3 mod 5. Now find a value for x that equals -3 mod 5??
[00:30:16] <Simplar> (hit,miss),(miss,hit),(hit,hit),(miss,miss)
[00:30:34] <Simplar> but if the second arrow is not fired, we never have (hit,hit) event
[00:30:45] <Simplar> as well as (hit,miss)
[00:31:05] *** Joins: CryptoDavid (uid14990@id-14990.highgate.irccloud.com)
[00:31:11] <Simplar> it's either (miss,hit),(hit,not fired), or (miss,miss)
[00:31:12] <mawk> yeah 1/2 + 1/2·1/2
[00:31:17] <Simplar> is it 2/3?
[00:31:21] <Simplar> to hit a target
[00:31:24] <mawk> no 3/4
[00:31:28] <mawk> as you said
[00:31:32] <riv> LTCD, you can use modular inverses to do CRT
[00:31:43] <mawk> CRT is fun
[00:31:46] <Simplar> ah so we always consider the second arrow to be fired in any case while calculating probability
[00:32:29] <mawk> Simplar: the probability of winning with the first arrow is 1/2, so you add 1/2 to the probability; then the probability of losing with that first arrow is 1/2, and the probability of then winning with the second arrow is 1/2
[00:32:32] <mawk> so total 1/2 + 1/2·1/2
[00:32:44] <mawk> it's clearer when the probability is not 1/2, then you see exactly
[00:32:46] <LTCD> riv I don't see how 2(25) = -3 mod 5
[00:32:50] <riv> inverse of 5 mod 7 is 3
[00:32:55] <riv> 3 * 5 * 4 = 25
[00:33:01] <mawk> it's the geometric law Simplar
[00:33:02] <Simplar> mawk: gotcha
[00:33:04] <riv> when you reduce mode 5 this becomes 0 because there's a 5 in it
[00:33:15] <riv> when you reduce mod 7 it becomes 3 because 5 * 4 = 1 (mod 7)
[00:33:21] <Simplar> so it's p+n(1-p)?
[00:33:26] <Simplar> where n is the amount of tries
[00:33:33] <Simplar> and p is probability to succeed per try
[00:33:45] <Simplar> oh no
[00:33:52] <Simplar> p+(1-p)^n
[00:33:53] <mawk> Simplar: p + (1-p)p + (1-p)²p + ... + (1-p)^(n-1) p
[00:34:01] <Simplar> ...true
[00:34:06] <mawk> where n is the number of tries
[00:34:08] <Simplar> p(1-p)^(n-1)
[00:34:32] <mawk> it's the probability of winning in less than or equal to n tries
[00:34:48] <mawk> exactly n tries is as you've just said; it's geometric law
[00:35:14] <mawk> as a quick bonus, try to see the limit as n → +∞
[00:35:24] <mawk> it's p/(1-(1-p)) = 1
[00:35:34] <mawk> which is good, the probability of winning eventually given infinite tries is 1
[00:35:46] <Simplar> That seems very logical
[00:35:56] <Simplar> So the more tries, the closer p is to 1
[00:36:01] <mawk> yeah
[00:36:05] <Simplar> Which makes absolute sense
[00:36:22] <mawk> P(<= n tries) is exactly 1-(1-p)^n
[00:36:39] <mawk> = 1 when n → +∞ again
[00:37:15] <Simplar> Okay, let's consider the case with two targets
[00:37:29] <Simplar> A chance to hit each is 3/4
[00:37:39] <mawk> so, exactly two targets out of 5
[00:37:50] <Simplar> No, for simplicity now, two out of two

[00:38:20] <Simplar> The chance to hit one is (3/4)*(1/4)

[00:39:23] <Simplar> if I want probability to hit a specific one and miss another

[00:40:24] <mawk> so you have a binomial coeffient 2-choose-1 in front
[00:40:42] <mawk> no it's not the number of targets, it's the number of combinations of choosing 1 target out of 2
[00:40:51] <mawk> which happens to be the number of targets here

[00:45:07] <mawk> 7x + 4 = 0 mod 5 means 7x = 1 mod 5, so x = 7^-1 mod 5
[00:45:15] <Simplar> (n!/(n-m)!) is the amount of ways to choose m objects out of n

[01:01:28] <qergle> no limit other than his overall limit of 10
[01:01:32] <mawk> so u = 3 and v = 3
[01:01:35] <Simplar> qergle: exactly 5 is as rare as exactly none
[01:01:41] <Simplar> so most likely is exactly 3
[01:01:49] <qergle> that;s wrong
[01:02:00] <qergle> exactly 5 happens much more often than exactly none
[01:02:15] <qergle> and exactly 3 isn't the most likely
[01:03:24] <mawk> so LTCD there is a technicality here, because a = 0 it wouldn't work, so take a = 5
[01:03:26] <mawk> it's the same result in the end

[01:03:46] <mawk> so you just apply mechnically the formula I gave you, you get m = 5·4·3 + 7·5·3 mod 35 = 25 mod 35
[01:03:50] <qergle> if he only had one arrow per target then exactly 0 and exactly 5 would be the same probability and then exactly 2 and exactly 3 would tie for most likely
[01:04:46] <qergle> but here we're 3 times as likely to hit (3/4) a target than not hit (1/4) so we should expect that hitting 5 is more likely than missing 5.

[01:55:27] <LTCD> riv So the trick to working it out, without listing all the numbers out manually, is if it's not prime do PHI(169) = p-1 * q-1
[01:55:48] <Simplar> By the way, a friend of mine thinks that the probability of hitting 3 targets out of 5 is the same as the probability of hitting 3 targets out of any amount of targets greater than 3. Why that?

[04:48:27] <pikapika> [itchyjunk], what pe problem are you trying to solve lol
[04:48:39] <qergle> pikapika: you would want x^2+(x+1)^2=(x+2)^2 which gives x^2-2x-3=0

[04:49:17] <pikapika> of which only 3 makes sense
[04:49:19] <[itchyjunk]> i still don't understand what i am doing
[04:49:21] <qergle> right
[04:49:35] <qergle> the other "triple" would be -1,0,1
[04:49:42] <pikapika> Thats actually a very simple proof I hadn't thought of
[04:49:44] <qergle> but that would be a wacky-looking triangle
[04:49:49] <dude12312414> it's kind of strange though, why are we missing -3, -4, -5?
[04:49:53] <pikapika> I was thinking of some weird number theory/geometry directions
[04:49:59] <pikapika> But this one is very nice and simple
[04:50:00] <dude12312414> (the -1 root gives -1, 0, 1)
[04:50:03] <[itchyjunk]> i don't see how that quadratic shows no other value works
[04:50:14] <pikapika> [itchyjunk], we are only considering consecutive integers
[04:50:19] <[itchyjunk]> right

[04:50:43] <dude12312414> oh

[04:51:05] <[itchyjunk]> but what tells me only 3,4,5 works?
[04:51:05] <pikapika> you could do with x-1,x,x+1 too
[04:51:06] <pikapika> etc
[04:51:10] <dude12312414> which leads to different solutions
[04:51:25] <dude12312414> because x - 2 may be larger in absolute value than x + 2
[04:51:27] <[itchyjunk]> wait forget this
[04:51:34] <[itchyjunk]> what about my problem!?! lol
[04:51:45] <[itchyjunk]> man didn't expect to be doing computation in a history class
[04:51:46] <qergle> dude12312414 / pikapika, yep
[04:52:06] <qergle> the issue is the ordering
[04:52:11] <[itchyjunk]> so 3,4,5 is not the only consicutive one?
[04:52:19] <pikapika> the right side must be larger than any of the left side
[04:52:21] <pikapika> thats the main thing
[04:52:31] <pikapika> [itchyjunk], it is the only non-trivial one
[04:52:39] <qergle> yes, and on the negative side it's the other ordering.
[04:52:40] <pikapika> the others involve a 0
[04:52:57] <pikapika> I have a feeling the negative one will only give -3,-4,-5
[04:53:01] <pikapika> or similar
[04:53:09] <qergle> so you have (x+2)^2+(x+1)^2=x^2 [negative side]
[04:53:11] <pikapika> we can have up to 16 solutions obviously
[04:53:14] <pikapika> including the trivial ones
[04:53:17] <pikapika> if we consider all the signs
[04:53:26] <pikapika> but these are all easily obtained from the natural number one by flippin signs
[04:53:32] <pikapika> so we can only consider the naturals
[04:53:45] <qergle> the -1,0,1 case is repeated (it's symmetric)
[04:53:55] <pikapika> ok, so 8+something I guess
[04:54:04] <qergle> and the other roots are 3 and -5 in the two
[04:54:17] <dude12312414> well the other choices of signs do not give *consecutive* triplets
[04:54:19] <pikapika> as I said if we consider signs then 3,4,5 leads to 8 possibilities
[04:54:23] <pikapika> oh right
[04:54:30] <pikapika> good point yeah
[04:54:37] <dude12312414> unless maybe you include 1, 0, 1 and -1, 0, -1, etc
[04:54:42] <qergle> so one quad gives {-1,3} and the other {-1,-5}
[04:54:46] <pikapika> yeah those were already considered
[04:54:54] <[itchyjunk]> this doesn't make sense
[04:54:55] <[itchyjunk]> https://i.ibb.co/hfgmXq4/image.png
[04:55:09] <[itchyjunk]> if i substitute my values in the given equation
[04:55:22] <[itchyjunk]> (169)^2 = (120)^2  + 119 ?
[04:55:42] <qergle> but when we restrict to ℕ we only have {3,4,5}. ∎
[04:55:51] <[itchyjunk]> oh they don't give me x,y,z
[04:55:56] <[itchyjunk]> they give me a,b,c
[04:56:18] <dude12312414> poor 2
[04:57:16] <pikapika> yeah so 3,4,5,-3,-4,-5,and likewise 1,0,-1 and -1,0,1 would be the only solutions
[04:57:20] <pikapika> and yeah

[05:15:24] <pikapika> ie the roots of the equations x^n-1=0
[05:15:50] <[itchyjunk]> argh i don't understand these triplets
[05:15:58] <dude12312414> from wikipedia: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Quartic_Formula.svg
[05:16:06] <pikapika> oh right, yeah sorry quartics are the last one with a general solution
[05:16:07] <qergle> for example, 9x^2+18x+9 satisfies that and you get (3x+3)^2
[05:16:09] <pikapika> not quintics
[05:16:40] <pikapika> qergle, yes
[05:16:47] <qergle> so ax^2+bx+c can be factored as (mx+n)^2 if a is a perfect square and b^2/4a=c
[05:16:53] * [itchyjunk] summons int-e 
[05:16:54] <qergle> is this an iff?
[05:16:56] <pikapika> Beyond the fourth order neither general formulae exist and nor is it even possible to express the roots of all polynomials in terms of radicals
[05:17:02] <pikapika> Some can be, but not all
[05:17:23] <pikapika> One of those cases actually solvable in terms of radicals are the primitive roots of unity

[05:23:31] <pikapika> qergle, I think I have an outline of a proof. Assume a^2+b^2=2^(2m), lets say the largest common power of two among a and b is 2^k so factoring out we are left with 2^2(m-k) in the right, which is still the square of a power of 2. Lets say we are left with p and q on the left. Either one is even and the other is odd...but then the sum can't be even so its discarded. ANother possibility is both being odd, which also can be proved an
[05:23:32] <pikapika> impossible case.

[06:47:18] <PlanckWalk> Matt|home: No, there is no situation in Blackjack where you can guarantee not winning before the hand is dealt.
[06:48:13] <Matt|home> ok. so theoretically you can lose or win an infinite number of hands in a row
[06:48:19] <PlanckWalk> Yes
[06:48:27] <PlanckWalk> There is no upper bound
[06:49:15] <Matt|home> is there a limit at one point where that number becomes close enough to zero that you can bet on it with probability on your side
[06:49:48] <PlanckWalk> As in place a side bet of "I will no win the next 500 hands"?
[06:49:53] <PlanckWalk> not*
[06:50:17] <Matt|home> essentially
[06:50:29] <PlanckWalk> "Having won 499 hands in a row, the chance of me winning the 500th is near zero" is false, though.
[06:50:42] <Matt|home> i know cards don't have memory, but i don't know how that squares away with "the number getting smaller means it's less and less likely"

[15:34:43] <ski> xormor : second problem is that `char' can be a signed integer type (it could also be unsigned, the standard doesn't specify). so in the `r' macro, the subtraction could yield a negative result, and then the remainder operation could also give a negative result, so then you won't get a non-negative integer less than `26' as expected for an offset. however, if you only input ASCII characters (which are

[17:10:09] <PlanckWalk> The general principle is that you can't assume that V consists of tuples of real numbers.
[17:10:37] <PlanckWalk> Literally any mathematical object can be an element of a vector space.
[17:10:40] <[-_-]> okay, but here I am studying real space
[17:10:46] <[-_-]> PlanckWalk: http://0x0.st/-vl7.txt
[17:10:51] <PlanckWalk> Yes, that doesn't matter.
[17:10:55] <[-_-]> see last 3 lines
[17:11:12] <PlanckWalk> "Real vector space" just means "vector space where the scalar multiples are real numbers"
[17:11:41] <[-_-]> then what were you trying to say with the sin example?
[17:11:43] <PlanckWalk> It doesn't mean "the vectors are real numbers" or "the vectors are tuples of real numbers" or anything along those lines.
[17:11:57] <[-_-]> oh....
[17:11:57] <PlanckWalk> The vectors can be functions.
[17:12:11] <[-_-]> ofcourse they can be

[17:14:42] <[-_-]> Then there is something missing....I think I have been assuming something without knowing
