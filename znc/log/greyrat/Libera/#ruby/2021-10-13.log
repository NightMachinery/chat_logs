[02:52:53] <nakilon> how much do you think this ruby costs? https://i.imgur.com/fdRDLh4.png
[02:59:44] <havenwood> nakilon: Synthetic or natural? Heat treated?
[03:00:09] <havenwood> It's massive.
[03:00:41] <havenwood> Lovely color.
[03:00:58] <havenwood> Wait, wrong #ruby channel!
[03:02:54] <nakilon> havenwood no info about heat treatment, from Tansania
[03:02:55] <nakilon> hehe
[03:03:23] <nakilon> anyway, $2'200'000
[03:04:48] <nakilon> more valuable than all the ruby code I've seen
[03:05:40] <nakilon> btw, a month ago or more there was a talk about tty-prompt and some lib by shopify
[03:07:47] <nakilon> I've already used the tty-prompt in my gem so I didn't rewrite it to use the shopify's one, but I'm thinking about it; and to properly replace something huge you have to have tests; and the tty-prompt does not seem to provide testing, so now I think
[03:08:54] <nakilon> is there anything for terminal like Selenium for browsers? so it would hide all the tty implementation details and provide some high level interface to read the state of the terminal screen?
[03:09:27] <havenwood> What kinda state are you looking to get at? More than width/height I assume?
[03:12:15] <nakilon> something like obtaining the array of currently shown characters
[03:13:06] <nakilon> to see that those fancy List selection and other components show what I need
[03:15:24] <nakilon> and should provide a way to send the keyboard events of course
[03:20:27] <nakilon> I imagine that it would be partially similar, i.e. include the part that is implemented in those "screen recorders" that are unfortunately don't really work -- when I tried all of them were throwing errors, so it's not adding much hope
[03:22:36] <nakilon> also I have a hypothesis that macOS might provide some AppleScript interface that would be not cross-platform but cross-platformity is a responsibility of those two libs, not mine
[03:24:28] <nakilon> and might not be able to run in Github Actions

[06:32:37] <trog> I just installed ruby on ubuntu using rvm and I'm using bash. Why does my shell open into a ruby environment by default now, or is this just something I need to configure in powerline
[06:33:26] <trog> as in opening a terminal now shows a prompt with $(r) ruby-2.7.2 ~/
[06:34:10] <trog> is there a way to deactivate this environment until I want to explicitly turn it on or something
[06:38:37] <trog> well, I just had rvm remove that installation of ruby and use the system installation instead, and everything is back to normal.

[18:59:15] <adam12> cahoots: There's a way to do it through gdb, but its' error prone.
[18:59:56] <adam12> cahoots: There's a tool called rbtrace that can do it for running processes.
