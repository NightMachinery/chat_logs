[09:03:02] <ButterNoodle> :| they better patch that shit
[09:03:09] <MootPoot> >Compared to placebo, decaffeinated coffee yielded significantly lower hunger during the whole 180-minute study period and higher plasma PYY for the first 90 minutes (p < 0.05). Caffeine in water had no effects on hunger or PYY. Caffeinated coffee showed a pattern between that of decaffeinated coffee and caffeine in water. These findings suggest that one or more noncaffeine ingredients in coffee may have the potential to decrease 
[09:03:09] <MootPoot> body weight. Glucose ingestion did not change the effects of the beverages.

[10:20:07] <MootPoot> tbh all things considered.... I think the current blend of capitalism + goverment control is the best we can hope for at this stage of human civilization

[10:21:00] <ButterNoodle> yes
[10:21:09] <ButterNoodle> monarchy and religion worked then
[10:21:10] <DunceCotus> democracy / capitalism doesn't work

[11:04:39] <DunceCotus> ButterNoodle: its a situation produced and/or exacerbated by capitalism
[11:05:12] <ButterNoodle> so whats the fix
[11:05:17] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: the welfare state would give him a place to live
[11:05:31] <ButterNoodle> we do that in america
[11:06:09] <ButterNoodle> dont they have social programs for under/unemployed in japan?
[11:06:24] <MootPoot> Tbh, not really 
[11:06:37] <MootPoot> In name sure... But the actual support offered is shit 
[11:06:43] <ButterNoodle> speak for urself MootPoot..
[11:07:09] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: I guess "hello work"it's a government job search agency. And also unemployment insurance?
[11:07:12] <MootPoot> I've spent a few days volunteering back when I was in school in the US...it wasn't pretty 
[11:07:23] <DunceCotus> employ basically means to be caught in a ploy
[11:07:28] <ButterNoodle> its poverty.. its not pretty
[11:07:56] <MootPoot> A proper welfare state isent supposed to have poverty, that's the point
[11:08:07] <MootPoot> 0 tolerance for it 
[11:09:26] <ButterNoodle> thats not sustainable
[11:10:14] <MootPoot> Hard to get a job when you don't have an address, and with no address means no credit, no credit means no phone, and no phone means no job ... Capitalism is fine if you can ensure people have the basic toolbox to get started properly participating in it rather then eating from used cans outside the back of a 7/11
[11:10:59] <DunceCotus> MootPoot: yes but what hampers the provision of this basic toolbox.. capitalism
[11:11:09] <DunceCotus> you can't fix capitalism with more capitalism
[11:11:10] <MootPoot> That's my only real issue with it, it is unfair in who gets the tools to get started

[11:12:45] <amigojapan> MootPoot: capitalism is how we make money to pay for the welfare state

[11:14:38] <ButterNoodle> no one gives a shit after the votes are counted here

[11:18:02] <DunceCotus> Capitalism cannot be leashed though, or leashing it doesn't stop it from being cancerous
[11:18:04] <ButterNoodle> that makes no sense
[11:18:24] <ButterNoodle> corporations should not be above paying for their own shit
[11:18:41] <S_T_A_N> Leashing it can work, however we failed to keep it leashed so all must burn
[11:18:54] <ButterNoodle> it shouldnt be a war of who can jack off the amazon the most to get them to cum to their town
[11:19:06] <DunceCotus> leashing it can work for a time before it is undone by capitalism
[11:19:14] <amigojapan> ButterNoodle: what about big corporation bail outs?
[11:19:23] <DunceCotus> capitalism will allow for some degree of leashing while it recoups to prevent that from happening again

[12:54:07] <amigojapan> Thanks PancakeMatsuri 
[12:54:33] <PancakeMatsuri> I wish they went into psychology, but that didn't happen
[12:54:59] <amigojapan> PancakeMatsuri: the manga is not a comedy?
[12:55:04] <amigojapan> I like comedy
[12:55:07] <PancakeMatsuri> amigojapan dunno
[12:55:23] <amigojapan> Ah ok
[12:55:31] <Berlin36> yoo amigojapan
[12:55:32] <PancakeMatsuri> Comedy here is superficial. It hides the issues she has

[13:01:47] <PancakeMatsuri> I've had a fairly easy time with it until this YAML config stuff
[13:01:53] <Berlin36> might be wrong, but is it in banking systems? amigojapan
[13:02:05] <Berlin36> or was it some other language that is very old but still used in banking systems

[13:02:57] <Berlin36> oh yeah it was cobol who's used in banking systems
[13:02:57] <PancakeMatsuri> with Perl?
[13:02:58] <amigojapan> Berlin36: banks and stock markets
[13:03:07] <Berlin36> COBOL is the foundation of 43 percent of all banking systems99,99. Systems powered by COBOL handle $3 trillion of daily commerce. COBOL handles 95 percent of all ATM card-swipes. COBOL makes 80 percent of all in-person credit card transactions possible.
[13:03:11] <Berlin36> but why cobol
[13:03:15] <Berlin36> what's so special about it
[13:03:21] <PancakeMatsuri> it's old
[13:03:25] <Berlin36> aaand
[13:03:28] <Berlin36> and so what
[13:03:39] <Berlin36> there are new languages now
[13:03:40] <PancakeMatsuri> I assume the systems they use are old
[13:04:02] <PancakeMatsuri> so, they evolved from the old systems

[13:04:18] <Berlin36> The language was elaborate and provided a near-English vocabulary for programmers to work with. It was designed to handle huge volumes of data and to be exceptionally mathematically accurate.
[13:04:19] <Berlin36> oh
[13:04:22] <Berlin36> look
[13:04:23] <amigojapan> Berlin36: they don't want to update it

[13:05:40] <Berlin36> revolutionary when it launched. It found favor within the financial sector, federal government, and major corporations and organizations.

[14:01:24] <amigojapan> emmeka: when they made crystal they changed floppy disks to CD ROMs, but I think CDs were already obsolete by then, especially for holding data
[14:02:40] <emmeka> the continued existence of CDs is kind of crazy
[14:03:07] <emmeka> there's no reason for them to be around, considering DVD-R's are absurdly cheap now and can do everything they can and more
[14:03:23] <Bco1981_2> !later tell MootPoot the result https://youtu.be/CrbIeondAQ0
[14:04:01] <emmeka> but for some reason DVD-audio never became a thing, and people's cars still take audio CDs, so here we are
[14:04:56] <amigojapan> emmeka: well the sailor moon one it is not clear if it is a CD or a DVD
[14:06:16] <amigojapan> emmeka: I think USB sticks made DVD-Rs obsolete
[14:07:20] <amigojapan> Altho the price of a DVD is very low compared to a USB
[14:08:32] <emmeka> right. 1tb of DVD-R will run you all of like $30 these days.
[14:08:52] <Bco1981_2> !later tell MootPoot forget that link... there is no sound.
[14:09:46] <amigojapan> emmeka: for example of you want to have a copy of every live bootable disc in Linux, DVD will be much more affordable than buying a bunch of USBs
[14:09:48] <Bco1981_2> !later tell MootPoot omg... it was my laptop audio on the wrong output
[14:11:02] <emmeka> amigojapan yeah, I still install distros by boot disc
[14:11:12] <amigojapan> I see
[14:11:30] <emmeka> because then I just have the disc, taking up minimal space in a stack with all the others, in case it is ever needed or someone else wants to try it
[14:11:40] <Bco1981_2> !late tell Sadale it worked!
[14:12:51] <amigojapan> emmeka: I usually use USB and overwrite the old stuff
[14:14:53] <emmeka> I think half the reason Bluray was never anywhere as successful as DVD is because it's such a locked down format and you can't do things like just burn your own Bluray discs easily
[14:14:55] <amigojapan> emmeka: I have an external DVD drive which would be good to take to other newer computers which don't have a DVD drive, but my father in law busted his CD drive on his PC and he has a lot of CDs so I think I will give him my DVD drive

[14:15:21] <amigojapan> Definitely emmeka 
[14:16:32] <emmeka> there's no reason that today that BD/DVD drives shouldn't be on most workstation PCs, but they're not, because using bluray discs on a PC the way people use DVD-R verges on impossible
[14:17:01] <amigojapan> Yup

[14:19:15] <emmeka> and the format could've been useful then, but it wasn't, because of paranoia about piracy
[14:19:33] <amigojapan> Ah ok. I never thought I needed blueray tho

[14:39:26] <emmeka> that makes sense, they were thicc

[14:51:32] <emmeka> amigojapan I know with gaming on old PCs this difference is important because a lot of games were designed with either composite graphics (and NTSC artifacting) or RGBI graphics in mind
[14:53:07] <amigojapan> emmeka: composite video was the norm in the time I used this she my arati 2600 and NES, the Vic 20 only had 40 characters per row
[14:53:09] <Urchin[emacs]> !later tell obakenoises https://i.redd.it/eoqwkecz7iw71.jpg
[14:53:39] <amigojapan> emmeka: I think the low character count was why the IBM PC won in business
[14:53:55] <emmeka> I don't think the Atari 2600 or the NES actually had composite video, they just did RF out
[14:54:06] <emmeka> had to use those stupid modulator boxes
[14:55:06] <emmeka> NES was the first game console I ever owned, already well out of date by that time. We had it wired up to an old tube TV that was older than the NES was.
[14:55:12] <amigojapan> emmeka: of yeah sorry I meant RF which was the same thing in the Vic 20
[14:55:17] <emmeka> ah
[14:55:36] <emmeka> maybe it was just the Commodore 64 that had composite/RGBI
[14:56:12] <amigojapan> emmeka: the Atari 2600 and Vic 20 used the same kind of RF modulator box

[15:03:07] <emmeka> amigojapan I'd say the reason IBM won in the PC industry was just because of backwards compatibility, MS-DOS was the first OS that you could keep your software when you upgraded to a new PC
[15:03:21] <emmeka> and the first to have upgradeable graphics cards
[15:03:39] <emmeka> that were also backwards compatible
[15:03:54] <amigojapan> emmeka: what about CPM?
[15:04:35] <emmeka> I don't know of it
[15:05:19] <amigojapan> emmeka: it's a precursor to MS-DOS and was almost elected by IBM as the OS for the PC
[15:05:49] <emmeka> with IBM DOS PC's, you could get a PC, and then later upgrade to CGA graphics, and then later get a new PC with VGA graphics, and all your shit would still work

[15:53:20] <DunceCotus> if you haven't had this issue I can only assume you are AI
[15:53:26] <ZP> it was "portable" but you needed decent lighting and also it could not fit in your pocket
[15:53:28] <Sapphirus> I also enjoyed My roomate is a cat.
[15:53:31] * ZP turns into a skeleton 
[15:53:54] <DunceCotus> amigojapan: what are you referring to?
[15:53:57] <ZP> Sapphirus: that sounds adorable
[15:54:12] <darkwitch> amigojapan, I tried reading the so called queen of poison manhua. it did not mention the word poison at all for the first 8 chapters, and there is still very little about poisons in it
[15:54:36] <amigojapan> DunceCotus: I assume that is what ZP had when he said "my screen stayed on
[15:54:37] <ZP> Sapphirus: have you seen a lot of older anime too?
[15:54:51] <Sapphirus> Depends on how old.
[15:54:54] <ZP> like kenshin?
[15:55:03] <amigojapan> Ouch darkwitch 
[15:55:24] <ZP> darkwitch: that's like 'ghost world'. no ghosts in it at all! RIPOFF

[15:55:36] <amigojapan> darkwitch: watch little witch academia, there are poisonous mushrooms
[15:55:50] <Sapphirus> ZP, nope.
[15:56:00] <darkwitch> amigojapan, if you want princes and other nobles and fancy chinese royal clothes, then there is a lot of that
[15:56:07] <Snake`s_Ghost> amigojapan, darkwitch why are you two trying to poison children
[15:56:17] <ZP> Sapphirus:  okay, maybey ou could watch Rurouni Kenshin lol

[16:14:54] <ZP> i was thinking about 90s anime.. and how is fushigi yugi not an isekai???
[16:15:31] *** Quits: wootehfoot (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot) (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[16:15:55] <Sapphirus> I think calling it an isekai would be the equivalent of throwing it in a trash bin.
[16:16:07] <amigojapan> ZP: fushigi yuugi is an isekai, so is rayearth and escaflone
[16:16:18] <ZP> yeah, totally
[16:16:24] <ZP> lol Sapphirus  
[16:16:32] <ZP> i don't think isekai has to be trash
[16:16:33] <ZP> lol
[16:16:44] <ZP> i also think inuyasha is isekai lol
[16:16:59] <Sapphirus> Even if you could classify it as one, I separate it mentally.
[16:17:07] <amigojapan> Yeah inuyasha too
[16:17:12] <Sapphirus> 9 out of 10 times I'll watch an Isekai and feel like I wasted my time.
[16:17:14] <ZP> right, just because of how isekais usually are
[16:17:27] <Sapphirus> yep
[16:17:35] <ZP> i'm starting to feel that with with slime even... and i really liked that one initially

[16:18:57] <ZP> i thought it was one of the better ones

[16:26:07] <Sapphirus> ZP, it was something that was apparent from the first season.
[16:26:17] <ZP> amigojapan:  right lol
[16:26:23] <Sapphirus> I stuck along because there are other strong points, but the pacing is definitely not one of them.
[16:26:38] <ZP> Sapphirus: i thought the pacing was better than one piece at least lol
[16:27:12] *** Quits: wootehfoot (~wootehfoo@user/wootehfoot) (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:27:15] <ZP> when i watch one piece i'm like "i swear to fuck we don't need another flashback" 
[16:27:30] <Sapphirus> There's probably a huge crowd of people that'd roast me over a grill for saying this..: I couldn't make it through the first episode of One Piece.
[16:27:52] <ZP> although with slime i'm like "i swear to fuck we don't need to have a whole episode on monster's preferences of liquors" 
[16:27:53] <Sapphirus> It felt just too unrealistic even for fiction.
[16:27:59] <ZP> Sapphirus:  wow
[16:27:59] <amigojapan> ZP: comedy isekai is usually acceptable as long as it is funny. Like the moon isekai and shincho yuusha

[16:29:33] <ZP> amigojapan:  which isekaki is the moon isekai??
[16:29:51] <ZP> oh, i like shield hero, but i also think it's kind of generic
[16:29:56] <darkwitch> is it taking place on the moon?
[16:30:00] <amigojapan> Sorry don't know ZP 
[16:30:00] <Sapphirus> Shield Hero is also alright
[16:30:02] <ZP> Sapphirus:  right. 
[16:30:30] <ZP> Sapphirus:  i actually really want to get into one piece since i read the first four volumes of the manga? but the anime.. omg...
[16:30:42] <ZP> they, like, need an editor
[16:32:07] <Sapphirus> I wanted to check it out, for one, because of all the hype behind it. People were telling me it was good, so.. I tried watching it.
[16:32:16] <Sapphirus> Reaction was like "How do people watch this shit?"
[16:32:51] <ZP> i think the manga is good
[16:33:15] <ZP> also i hope you didn't watch the old 4kids one?
[16:33:24] <Sapphirus> nah, the new one.
[16:33:26] <Bco1981> Sadale: yes, this last adaptor the vr headset turned on, AND!, it used the 3080 :D

[16:33:35] <Sadale> Bco1981, congratz! :D

[16:34:30] <darkwitch> amigojapan, did you make a typo again? the moon isekai
[16:34:31] <ZP> it's the style
[16:34:46] <ZP> yeah, i'm like, what isekai is that?
[16:34:56] <Bco1981> Sadale: thou still a problem. the headset blacks out once in awhile while playing...
[16:35:03] <Sadale> Bco1981, ouch :(
[16:35:11] <Sapphirus> Am I broken for not liking it, or are other people broken for tolerating this anime adaptation?
[16:35:14] <Sadale> Bco1981, imagine in the mid way of fapping to VR hentai
[16:35:33] <ZP> Sapphirus:  nah, it's not for everyone. and the pacing does suck
[16:36:41] <Sapphirus> One Piece fans wouldn't respond well to what I'm saying. It makes me feel like something is wrong with me for finding this stuff to be problematic.
[16:36:41] <Sadale> Bco1981, if you wish to fap tho better to do that sooner rather than later. No fap November's coming

[17:37:34] <Sapphirus> Quite mild for November, though.

[17:38:46] <amigojapan> There is no "yes"in November
[17:38:46] <Sapphirus> All the temperature has to do is fall below 0 consistently and snow is going to begin accumulating. Otherwise it's just going to be rainy and miserable.
[17:39:12] <darkwitch> amigojapan, now I get it (or do I)
[17:39:39] <darkwitch> there is yes in yesterday
[17:39:47] <Sapphirus> I actually like winter. Aesthetic of snow is pretty. 
[17:40:19] <darkwitch> I like winter in the tropics

[17:49:57] <amigojapan> Let me see darkwitch 
[17:50:15] <Sapphirus> > In 1742, Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744) created a temperature scale that was the reverse of the scale now known as "Celsius"
[17:50:26] <Sapphirus> interesting
[17:50:55] <amigojapan> Ah ok thanks darkwitch 
[17:52:10] <darkwitch> Centigrade has been retired since 1948

[17:53:04] <amigojapan> darkwitch: no. I use it
[17:53:26] <amigojapan> Centigrade scale
[17:53:43] <darkwitch> Centigrade is the old fashioned name for Celsius as mentioned above. The name Centigrade was derived from the Latin originally meaning a hundred degrees. ... Then, in 1948, by international agreement, Cristin's adapted scale became known as Celsius to honour the Swedish Scientist, who first invented this temperature scale.
[17:53:45] <amigojapan> darkwitch: it's never too late for truth
[17:54:05] <darkwitch> don't be such a boomer
[17:54:14] <darkwitch> say Celsius
[17:54:24] <Sapphirus> ^
[17:54:29] <amigojapan> darkwitch: except he did not Invent it
[17:54:44] <Sapphirus> Well he did, but then someone flipped it, I guess.
[17:54:58] <amigojapan> No look at the video
[17:55:15] <amigojapan> These are veritasium and vsauce
[17:55:16] <darkwitch> A little over one year later Frenchman Jean Pierre Cristin proposed an inverted version of the scale (freezing point 0°, boiling point 100°).

[17:57:28] <darkwitch> a dreadful name
[17:57:46] <Sapphirus> ah, I understand why he did this inversion. Seems like a reasonable explanation: To avoid having to use a - prefix.
[17:59:09] <amigojapan> Nobody is watching the video from very prestigious YouTubers
[17:59:23] <amigojapan> You guys are just speculating
[17:59:31] <Sapphirus> I am. This is what veritasium proposed and I don't disagree with it.
[17:59:38] <Sapphirus> Seems logical.

[18:07:22] <Sapphirus> He did play a crucial role in the development of the scale.

[18:16:16] <darkwitch> we can never agree on what to call something

[18:17:06] <amigojapan> I am too sleepy
[18:17:09] <darkwitch> what?
[18:17:53] <amigojapan> darkwitch: 10ml is 0.01l of shampoo
[18:18:38] <amigojapan> And since one l of shampoo is about 1 kilogramme of water
[18:18:40] <darkwitch> how does that help?
[18:19:36] <amigojapan> I think shampoo is mostly water
[18:20:06] <Sapphirus> Coconut oil is the most-have ingredient in shampoo or conditioner for me.
[18:20:13] <Sapphirus> must*
[18:20:42] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I eat coconut oil
[18:20:51] <amigojapan> Don't want it on my hair
[18:21:54] <Sapphirus> It's very moisturising and nourishing. 
[18:22:35] <Sapphirus> Only thing I found to keep the oil balance in my hair.
[18:22:41] <amigojapan> I like my hair to be dry
[18:23:31] <Sapphirus> Oil production will make my hair greasy if I don't use some sort of oil during/after washing it.
[18:23:46] <Sapphirus> And I don't like waking up with my hair like a grease ball.
[18:24:02] <amigojapan> Sapphirus: I stayed levering shampoo on for 6 minutes on my hair, and that achieves my goal of getting my hair dry
[18:24:41] <amigojapan> So you put on grease to avoid grease? I don't think that makes sense
[18:25:01] <Sapphirus> Mine stays relatively dry, so to speak, with this regimen. 
[18:25:13] <Jigsy> Finished all of Gunsmith Cats.

[18:25:17] <amigojapan> Alright
[18:25:33] <Sapphirus> If I strip the oil that's in my hair, oil overproduction will kick in and the opposite will be achieved

[19:26:20] <Urchin[emacs]> cshelton024: Cowboy Bebop is already on Netflix
[19:26:23] <cshelton024> I want to see hero movies that are 100% photo real CGI, that is less story driven and more action throughout the whole movie. For example: Like all of the awesome effects and action in Spiderman Far From Home, but the whole movie, not just some fight scenes. I think that's only way to bring an anime into any kind of "live action".
[19:27:18] <Snake`s_Ghost> Urchin[emacs], why do they look so sad and hopeless

[19:41:30] <cshelton024> I'll give the live action version a chance, but I think it's going to be hard for them to meet everyone's expectations for it. They should have done the photo real CGI version of the whole thing (Like Alita but all characters and environments). Then they could have used the voice actors that we all know as well. That probably would have been a wiser choice. I just hope it lives up to Mr. Shinichirō Watanabe's masterpiece somewhat.

[23:53:05] <Bco1981> 2016
[23:53:09] <CountDeMoney> ten years ago in 2005 you were 5 (!!!! can you remember that long ago??)
[23:53:10] <Berlin36> ayy you're roey
[23:53:14] <CountDeMoney> holaaaaa m8
[23:53:27] <CountDeMoney> can you remember life at age 5?

[23:53:30] <CountDeMoney> or age 4 even?
[23:53:32] <Berlin36> yeah
[23:53:38] <CountDeMoney> wow good for you
[23:53:39] <CountDeMoney> keep on that
[23:53:40] <Berlin36> i remember from age of 4 some moments
[23:53:51] <CountDeMoney> I started a diary around your age
[23:53:56] <CountDeMoney> now I have 20000 pages
[23:54:04] <Berlin36> i remember how i was flexing my reading skills in kindergarden when i was 4
[23:54:05] <CountDeMoney> ffrom age 4, good good, write it down :")
[23:54:19] <CountDeMoney> that's fantastic!
[23:54:22] <Berlin36> whhaaaaaat 20000 pages
[23:54:23] <Berlin36> duude
[23:54:30] <CountDeMoney> yeah
[23:54:32] <CountDeMoney> well
[23:54:35] <Berlin36> what do you write there?
[23:54:36] <CountDeMoney> between 15-20k pages
[23:54:39] <CountDeMoney> everything.
[23:54:44] <Berlin36> i couldn't have written
[23:54:48] <CountDeMoney> then I write monthly reviews
[23:54:51] <CountDeMoney> and then yearly reviews
[23:54:56] <Berlin36> idunno man
[23:55:15] <Berlin36> i'd write this on a computer so i can later encrypt them
[23:55:18] <CountDeMoney> it just keeps me happy to do that, I've found.
[23:55:34] <Berlin36> lol, i can't just write what i think, that seems odd
[23:55:44] <CountDeMoney> then write it on a computer that's not attached to the internet
[23:55:55] <CountDeMoney> a laptop that's not connectd to internet, for example
[23:56:06] <Berlin36> yeaaaaah i could try doing that, may be fun
[23:56:08] <CountDeMoney> Berlin36: it'ssss something you get betterrr and better at
[23:56:15] <Berlin36> i see
[23:56:18] <CountDeMoney> plus I have a system for it
[23:56:21] <CountDeMoney> markup and such
[23:56:25] <Berlin36> oh
[23:56:27] <Berlin36> that's nice
[23:56:32] <Berlin36> it's like a book of life
[23:56:33] <Berlin36> but
[23:56:34] <CountDeMoney> and I wrote scripts to data-mine it
[23:56:34] <CountDeMoney> yep
[23:56:39] <Berlin36> do you write some 
[23:56:40] <Berlin36> um
[23:56:43] <Berlin36> personal moments
[23:56:45] <CountDeMoney> yeah
[23:56:47] <Berlin36> feelings and such
[23:56:48] <Berlin36> oh
[23:56:52] <CountDeMoney> absolutely
[23:56:55] <CountDeMoney> that's why I did it
[23:56:58] <Berlin36> hmm
[23:57:01] <CountDeMoney> like when my dog passed
[23:57:05] <CountDeMoney> when I was 26 (am 41 now)
[23:57:07] <Berlin36> oh
[23:57:10] <CountDeMoney> I needed to put my thoughts somewhere
[23:57:18] <CountDeMoney> and it became a daily thing for me.
[23:57:19] <CountDeMoney> this diary.
[23:57:21] <Berlin36> and um
[23:57:23] <Berlin36> do you write like
[23:57:25] <Berlin36> long stories
[23:57:27] <Berlin36> or just
[23:57:33] <Berlin36> short and clear
[23:57:38] <CountDeMoney> both
[23:57:42] <Urchin[emacs]> !later tell obakenoises https://i.imgur.com/F1QsQ7r.jpg

[23:57:51] <CountDeMoney> journalwriting.reddit.com
[23:57:56] <CountDeMoney> journaling.reddit.com
[23:57:58] <Berlin36> and um
[23:58:00] <CountDeMoney> ya
[23:58:07] <Berlin36> do you write during the day or at the end of the day
[23:58:17] <CountDeMoney> all during the day
[23:58:22] <CountDeMoney> all
[23:58:29] <CountDeMoney> I've done everything / do everything
[23:58:48] <CountDeMoney> I'd rather get that thought down instead of try to remember the moment
[23:58:54] <Urchin[emacs]> I was unable to get even close to writing a journal daily
[23:58:58] <Berlin36> sooo you can now just kinda go back in time and remember every day of your life
[23:59:03] <Berlin36> this sounds great ngl
[23:59:09] <Berlin36> but
[23:59:11] <CountDeMoney> I try to make each entry a snapshot in time
[23:59:17] <Berlin36> what if the day is like pretty boring
[23:59:26] <CountDeMoney> Urchin[emacs]: I started small
[23:59:33] <CountDeMoney> then you write your reaction to the news
[23:59:41] <Berlin36> for example you just stayed home and watched tv all day
[23:59:43] <CountDeMoney> or to what's going on in your friends' and family's lives
[23:59:48] <Berlin36> oh 
[23:59:57] <Berlin36> it seems a hard thing to do 
[23:59:57] <CountDeMoney> you want to give your future self context
