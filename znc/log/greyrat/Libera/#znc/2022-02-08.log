[14:32:39] <bello> hi how do i find my znc version on Ubuntu?  i don't remember how i installed before (user only or whole system) but i have 1.8.1 version now. how can i upgrade it to last version without lose anything by previous same way?

[14:35:03] <bello> bookworm: hello, how do i ask apt know about it?

[14:35:54] <bello> actually i don't remember by which user i installed it too.
[14:36:39] <bookworm> that will always be root in the case of apt
[14:36:49] <bello> znc/focal,now 1.7.5-4 amd64 [installed]
[14:36:53] <bookworm> as only root may install things system wide
[14:37:06] <bookworm> so there you go, with apt then from the official repo
[14:37:17] <style> /znc version
[14:37:19] <style> on irc
[14:38:05] <bookworm> if you are running 1.8 though that means that you have multiple znc binaries on your system
[14:38:42] <bookworm> so in that case, find out which binary you are actually running and where that thing is located
[14:40:54] <bello> but when i run apt list znc as root user then i got return as Listing... Done
[14:42:15] <bello> i did znc --version as user and output is different

[14:42:48] <bello> it means i have 2 znc installed ?

[18:51:51] <bello> ah yes DarthGandalf you're right. its ok now thank you  :)

[18:52:58] <bello> DarthGandalf can you say me how to ignore a person with regex who sending same spam ?
[18:55:17] <Khaytsus> bello: Don't think znc has regex ignore, some clients do
[18:56:08] <DarthGandalf> that module does support regex?
[18:56:56] <bello> <*ignore> AddPattern [mMaAnNcC] <regex>: Ignore text matching a regular expression
[18:57:19] <Khaytsus> Oh, oops.
[18:57:21] <bello> but i can't find what's the right command
[18:58:32] <Khaytsus> What right command?  NOt sure what the regex pattern is offhand, but surely could just test that
[18:59:00] <Khaytsus> I'd just try this first i guess..  addpattern m .*spam.*

[19:03:35] <bello> yes DarthGandalf 
[19:03:41] <bello> Do you want to know a secret?
[19:04:08] <bello> i want to ignore that person who is sending me text on previous line
[19:05:39] <Khaytsus> bello: Are you referring to me?  Otherwise I'm not sure what you're asking about now.
[19:05:48] <Khaytsus> And if so I can't imagine why but knock yourself out.
[19:09:20] <bello> Khaytsus: nooo
[19:09:32] <Khaytsus> bello: Okay heh just unclear what you were asking then ;)
[19:09:34] <bello> i was meaning for my previous line
[19:09:58] <bello> Do you want to know a secret?  - i want to ignore this text from person

[20:31:21] <Khaytsus> bello: Sorry, I understand you weren't talking about me, otherwise I've been busy this morning with work 
[20:31:55] <Khaytsus> If the text is consistent you should be able to regex it pretty easy I'd think, or just ignore the user or hostmask if that's consistent
[20:31:59] <bello> ok Khaytsus sorry for misunderstanding 
[20:32:24] <bello> user changing hostmask always 
[20:32:36] <Khaytsus> bello: Ah, that sucks.  Is the text consistent?
[20:32:40] <bello> nickname is changing and often same too
[20:32:50] <bello> text is static 
[20:33:07] <Khaytsus> Then yeah just put that in, should be what I mentioned earlier then I'd think
[20:33:23] <Khaytsus> I've never used znc's ignore, I just do that in client
[20:33:49] <bello> i used but forgot how
[20:34:18] <Khaytsus> https://wiki.znc.in/Ignore     this has all the info, I asume you've been looking at this?
[20:34:29] <Khaytsus> I'd just try this first i guess..  addpattern m .*spam text.*
