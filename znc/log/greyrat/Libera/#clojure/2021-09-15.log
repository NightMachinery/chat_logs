[01:12:51] <lotuseater> Hi there, has anyone experience with using Clojure with .NET? Don't get me wrong, I have nearly no experience with C# cause it interests me not so much, but soon starts a 2-years retraining where beside other (weird) things C# will be used for programming.
[01:14:06] <lotuseater> And since I'm not aware that Armed Bear Common Lisp could also target .NET like with the JVM ... :)
[01:15:09] <ridcully_> there is a CLR version of clojure and last time i checked it was on the same version number like the jvm version
[01:15:12] * technomancy has always wanted to check out F#
[01:15:36] <ridcully_> yet i have never heard of here or on leenode anyone saying claiming to have used it in anger
[01:15:52] <lotuseater> technomancy: I looked at F# sometimes as I'm also very interested into Haskell, neat thing. :)
[01:16:21] <ridcully_> the "business ocaml" as they say over in #haskell ;)
[01:16:27] <lotuseater> ridcully_: ah nice, I just want to have the option when they provide me some freedom in $PROJECT
[01:16:51] <lotuseater> hehe yes, or in Gravity Falls terms "It's a rock that *looks* like a face."
[01:17:16] <ridcully_> yet that was my "journey" too.  tried to make heads and tails of the build stuff things over in CLR land to have a peek into clojure and ended up having a peek into f# because it has build tools and project bootstrap etc
[01:18:09] <lotuseater> In this ZOOM meeting yesterday about information one could have get the opinion that software jobs can be just about apps and webstuff.

[01:18:47] <lotuseater> okay nice, I'll remember
[01:19:08] <lotuseater> or ClojureScript should also be good
[01:19:43] <ridcully_> not saying that clr clojure is not used, but just no one ever claimed serious use over in irc

[01:20:35] <lotuseater> And I don't think it's so much worth the time doing another implementation of CL for .NET ^^

[01:21:46] <lotuseater> I like Jitsi.
[01:21:51] <technomancy> it's good!
[01:22:00] <technomancy> we used it for fennelconf the past couple years
[01:22:11] <lotuseater> you mean Jitsi? it is
[01:22:17] <lotuseater> we use it at the hackerspace
[01:23:55] <lotuseater> And honestly I just told yesterday that I have experience with (scientific) Python and Linux. not a lie, but one doesn't have to pull out the serious stuff from the beginning ^^ 
[01:24:19] <lotuseater> I hope not too much people will ask me "Do you have WhatsApp?" when it starts at the end of the month.
[01:25:09] <ridcully_> lotuseater: they are on gitter: https://github.com/clojure/clojure-clr - seems alt least roughly up-to-date
[01:25:34] <lotuseater> another thing I don't have :) but maybe I can pull some people to Signal
[01:25:56] <technomancy> man I really wish I could get excited about Signal
[01:25:57] <ridcully_> last time i used gitter it was read-able without account
[01:26:22] <lotuseater> technomancy: the funny thing is, for this Microsoft Research Group in Cambridge that catched some of the capable guys from Haskell GHC.
[01:26:38] <technomancy> I recently got an arm laptop and they're just like "sorry; you don't basically exist so you don't get to use Signal" ಠ_ಠ

[01:33:42] <lotuseater> yes github tells so
[01:34:51] <lotuseater> but you can use everything Clojure provides too when using it?
[01:36:09] <technomancy> no, not really
[01:36:13] <technomancy> no immutable data structures
[01:36:36] <lotuseater> ah okay, but cool anyway

[04:51:41] <andreyorst> I've recently asked about pattern matching libs here
[04:52:00] <andreyorst> but in the end I've solved all my problems using sets
[04:53:00] <andreyorst> knowing what Fennel's match compiles to opened my eyes that pattern matching is just `if` on steroids
[04:53:13] <andreyorst> haha
[04:53:51] <lotuseater> indeed it is :) or to conds if you want so ^^
[04:54:05] <andreyorst> thankfully, clojure's sets are callable, so the resulting code was not that bigger than with pattern matching
[04:54:40] <andreyorst> lotuseater: Fennel's `if` is `cond` so yeah, it's more like a cond on steroids :D
[04:55:12] <andreyorst> and I actually think that this is really great when if behaves like cond
[04:56:46] <andreyorst> Emacs Lisp at least has an implicit progn in the false branch, which justifies that it doesn't allow more than two branches. Clojure's if is 2 branches at the most for no real reason I think
[04:56:50] <lotuseater> hm yes, `cond` was there historically before `if` coming from LISP. in eg CL we have IF as a special operator and COND compiles to IFs ^^
[04:57:13] <andreyorst> it's the same in clojure
[04:57:25] <lotuseater> oh okay I didn't know that of elisp
[04:58:15] <lotuseater> the elisp thing is a bad choice imo
[04:59:00] <andreyorst> I think it's a cool feature - I often write things like (if (not test) false-expr true-expr1 true-expr2 ...)
[04:59:12] <lotuseater> hmmm
[04:59:21] <technomancy> implicit progn is basically just saying "hey go ahead and put side effects whereever; I don't care"
[04:59:23] <andreyorst> instead of (if test (progn true-exprs) false-expr)
[04:59:43] <technomancy> it's good for an imperative language
[05:00:34] <andreyorst> technomancy: don't worry, all I'm trying to say is that fennel's `if` is the best among others
[05:00:42] <andreyorst> :)
[05:01:26] <technomancy> haha cool
[05:05:26] <andreyorst> aside from that, why some clojure branching macros use :>> keyword?
[05:05:52] <andreyorst> I don't remember which one that was exactly, but it seems hella weird
[05:09:51] <andreyorst> that was condp
