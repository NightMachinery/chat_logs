[01:12:33] <almostdvs> My wordpress instance is showing a different php version than the one installed; showed by php -v and phpinfo
[01:13:24] <almostdvs> As far as I can tell this older version is not specified in any php.ini or .htaccess folders.  Is there any where else I can look for this discrepancy?
[01:14:39] <Albright> almostdvs: Your server is using PHP-FPM to start the PHP instance (probably) and your shell is finding a PHP binary according to your $PATH. These are ending up to be two different binaries. Does that make sense?
[01:14:58] *** Quits: junktext (~junktext@gateway/vpn/pia/junktext) (Quit: junktext)
[01:15:21] <__adrian> you need to configure your webserver (apache) to use the php version you want. nothin' to do with the cli.
[01:15:47] <Albright> If the CLI version is the desired one, yes. Might be other way around?
[01:16:06] <__adrian> might
[01:16:20] <almostdvs> that kind of makes sense.  phpinfo page shows the correct page however
[01:17:08] <Albright> Okay, so you need to edit your $PATH so that the path to the new php binary appears before the path to the old one. Are you familiar with how to do that?
[01:17:51] <almostdvs> yes, I think you're a little confused
[01:17:59] <almostdvs> wordpress shows 7.3.6
[01:18:13] <__adrian> > phpinfo page   // meaning, webpage? if both are on the same server then it's def something in the config
[01:18:27] <__adrian> is this something you're hosting yourself? or a shared host?
[01:18:29] <almostdvs> php-v shows 7.4.27
[01:18:34] <Albright> Ah…
[01:18:38] <almostdvs> phpinfo() shows 7.4.27
[01:18:41] <__adrian> php -v  is not relevant
[01:19:02] <almostdvs> hosting myself
[01:19:03] <__adrian> are you looking at phpinfo() one the cli, or on a webpage (same webserver)?

[01:19:39] <__adrian> did you configure the webserver yourself or do you have/hire a sysadmin
[01:20:18] <almostdvs> I am the sysadmin lol
[01:20:30] <almostdvs> but this is a bitnami install (eyeroll)
[01:20:46] <almostdvs> I migrated from a previous image to this specifically to upgrade php
[01:20:55] <almostdvs> and yet.. still have the old version
[01:21:58] <Albright> Are you using Apache?
[01:22:34] <almostdvs> yes
[01:23:06] <Albright> Okay. Check if it put some .htaccess files in your WP directory which are overriding the Apache config and forcing it to use a different version of PHP.
[01:23:13] <__adrian> bitnami is something you might need to find dedicated support for. don't know the details there.
[01:24:15] <almostdvs> what string am I looking for that would override php version?
[01:24:34] <almostdvs> I believe I checked every .htaccess on the server but perhaps I looked for the wrong thing
[01:25:16] <Albright> I'm not greatly familiar with Apache so I don't know off the top of my head.
[01:25:31] <Albright> Are you using PHP-FPM
[01:25:34] <Albright> ?
[01:25:48] <almostdvs> yes
[01:26:09] <Albright> When you check running services, do you see two PHP-FPM services?
[01:26:49] <almostdvs> no
[01:27:43] <Albright> Hmm. Yeah, this might be a question for Bitnami support channels at this point.

[01:33:59] <__adrian> turn it off

[01:34:22] <Albright> Yes. You are not a shared hosting provider.
[01:34:25] <__adrian> if wp cooperates, turn off mod_rewrite too
[01:35:45] <almostdvs> couldn't that introduce security issues.
[01:35:56] <almostdvs> that's the reason I haven't migrated from bitnami
[01:36:04] <almostdvs> and the .htaccess that are present
[01:36:07] <__adrian> what?
[01:36:25] <__adrian> yes, you do need to learn about what you're doing so you configure things properly

[12:02:55] <AllenJB> I don't think there's any magic. The IDEs are "hard coded" to know that include / require take paths.

[13:50:08] <Nekomander> Bushmaster, https://stackoverflow.com/a/13736982 - https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_autoindex.html#headername
[13:51:41] <Nekomander> Doing index directory listing is generally a bad idea for security reasons. Alternatively, you can do a PHP script that list files that sits in a specific folder (rather than any folder that can br browsed by anyone.)
[13:54:19] <Bushmaster> thanks Nekomander , it's not easy, I gather that much now, thanks Chief
[13:56:21] <Bushmaster> well I am back to PHP again anyway, I spent lot of time learning SQL and other stuffs, but now I need to focus on PHP for the coming months
[13:57:05] <Nekomander> For example, create 3 folders: pictures, videos and music. Then have a script that reads a list of files within the aforementioned folders. Could make use of something like this https://www.php.net/manual/en/recursivedirectoryiterator.construct.php
[13:57:09] <TML> Bushmaster: But if you DO decide to go with mod_autoindex, the directives IndexStyleSheet and IndexHeadInsert might be helpful
[13:57:14] <Nekomander> To read files in directories.

[16:55:33] <arash> Hello, is it wrong to save some settings as a json in mysql in one column? I mean there is a setting page in my app, including some prices and some other things, I want to save all of them as json in one sql update query when save button clicked.
[16:57:31] <lembron> arash wrong? yes - is it sometimes still the "right thing todo" also yes...
[16:59:08] <arash> lembron, so what is your suggestion? you mean I should consider one column for each setting and update them with few mysql update query?
[17:00:09] <lembron> ideally you want everything normalized (and I asume you are talking about storing it as a string and serialize/unserialize in your application - if you are using mysql8 native json stuff things may flip a little)
[17:03:24] <lembron> and then I guess it depends a little on the variety/who/what you want to work with it (and there not only today, but also in a week and in a month and in a year...) "setting_color, setting_font (red, arial)" vs. "setting_name, setting_value (color, red) (font, arial)" vs. "settings={color:red,font:arial}"
[17:05:04] <lembron> "show me everyone using red" - and "add new setting for font-size" become very different tasks depending on the route ;-)
[17:07:24] <lembron> arash ^^ see if that makes any sense, then pick accordingly
[17:07:24] <arash> lembron, I get your point. my main problem is If I wanted to consider different column for each setting it needs lots of select,update mysql query for selecting and updating those settings. that's my main problem.
[17:07:50] <lembron> sql querys are "dirt cheap"
[17:08:15] <lembron> if a page has 20 or 200 you likely wont even notice
[17:08:53] <arash> aha. ok then. :) thank you
[17:09:27] <TinoDidriksen> I would be worried if a page takes >20 queries to render.
[17:14:30] <lembron> arash and I am not even sure where you mean... - "named cols" as in example 1 you mean? - select/update is one query there, but you need schema-changes to add new ones is the bummer, while on the upside it allows for datatypes&indexing -- for core-config thats usually nice to have, but for "runtime settings" the second model is more the way to go - third "dirty string" is kind of a last resort
[17:14:31] <lembron> generally
[17:20:40] <lembron> TinoDidriksen on a sidenote, seems like there isnt even another option that splitting my preg_match-payload - even when raising both pcre limits to 1000000*1000000 thing still segfaults out

[17:22:54] <Naktibalda> arash: have you considered using different row for each setting ?
[17:37:49] <lembron> (that be number 2)
[17:45:30] <arash> NakedKing, yes, but because there are many settings it needs many rows. that's my problem.
[17:46:32] <Naktibalda> if you need all settings, you run SELECT * FROM settings WHERE user_id = X
[17:47:22] <Naktibalda> if you need one setting, you use WHERE user_id = X and setting_name = 'color'
[17:48:19] <arash> Naktibalda, :D well. that is a nice one :D. thank you. also I think there is no need to consider user_id for that, just a SELECT * FROM settings :D
[17:49:10] <Naktibalda> that's right, if they are global settings and not per-something
[17:49:37] <Naktibalda> so your original plan was to have one JSON string stored in one field of one row :)
[17:51:27] <arash> Naktibalda, yes. :).
[17:53:51] <arash> now In my case since those are global settings I think I should consider 3 cols, option_name , option_key and option_value for example.
[17:54:34] <Naktibalda> what's the key?

[21:55:08] <Naktibalda> all precision arithmetic libraries that are PHP extensions

[22:00:09] <__adrian> having to compile yourself is not a usual situation

[22:03:30] <chazy> or that's a given?
[22:04:05] <__adrian> whether you need to load it also depends on packaging (and the package's install process)

[22:34:15] <goddard> i wonder if php devs know that their skills would be in higher demand and they could make more money if the stack worked in more places

[22:35:57] <goddard> how many people support your work?
[22:35:58] <Naktibalda> well, there is PHP Foundation now, so you can donate fo it too
[22:36:15] <goddard> any chance you can put money into a certain bucket of focus?
[22:36:46] <Naktibalda> there are no core devs in this channel
[22:37:47] <goddard> maybe a Jetbrains/VSCode paid plugin that enables mobile/desktop development would make a lot of money?

[22:55:45] <goddard> oh it was tauri
[22:55:50] <goddard> that took awhile
[22:58:14] <goddard> but looks like they haven't made it to mobile yet
[23:02:47] <goddard> DeskGap has a good method
[23:03:06] <goddard> just use the mobile platforms native webview to keep the size down
[23:03:28] <goddard> just need to bundle php instead
[23:06:35] <Nekomander> goddard, virtual environments is great because one doesn't have to care about the specific version number of python libraries involved and the software vendor can just choose which version of python libs to work on. Similar to how PHP devs can choose the version of Symfony framework to use and not having to deal with the hypothetical version of Symfony framework globally installed. (e.g. Symfony 2 when everyone should be using Symfony 6)
[23:07:41] <goddard> Ya that is what people say, but it is really just annoying to work with.
[23:08:45] <goddard> should just download the library i want and save it in my project root and bundle it during deployment

[23:09:25] *** Joins: clarjon1 (~clarjon1@user/clarjon1)
[23:10:13] <goddard> if they just made it project based and had a flat executable it would make things so simple
[23:10:46] <Nekomander> goddard, do you hate using a dependency manager? O_O
[23:11:08] <goddard> i hate complexity for little to no extra benefit
[23:11:24] <Nekomander> goddard, do you use ANY kind of dependency manager?
[23:11:42] <goddard> composer in php projects yes
[23:12:37] <Nekomander> Okay, so with virtualenv, you get pip for that purpose. The whole point is for the project to be self-contained without relying on libs installed on the system.
[23:12:50] <Nekomander> How else do you plan to fetch/install python libraries?
[23:13:07] <Nekomander> pip is python's composer.
[23:14:27] <goddard> ya kinda
[23:15:54] <Nekomander> Kinda? Can you expand on that? Am I missing something?
[23:16:23] <goddard> a virtual environment wouldn't be required if you simply had it setup that way to begin with meaning everything is based on a project
[23:17:34] <goddard> i understand the reason for storing libraries in central locations in the past
[23:18:07] <goddard> but now it doesn't make sense because even phones can have 1 tb of space
[23:19:02] <Nekomander> I do not know exactly what " had it setup that way to begin with meaning everything is based on a project" means. As in, installed in the classic /usr/bin, or /usr/share/bin folders? Use root to get permissions to write into such directories?
[23:19:26] <Nekomander> I am talking about WHERE to store python libs at.
[23:19:44] <goddard> yeah those locations should be dedicated to the operating system
[23:19:57] <goddard> user content should be in a home directory
[23:21:15] <goddard> /home/$USER/libs/pythonVER/lib_name-ver is fine
[23:21:32] <Nekomander> If it is a software being installed by the OS, it would likely be stored in a hidden dot file within home directory.
[23:21:32] <goddard> or whatever xdesktop standard
[23:21:58] <goddard> you mean a package manager?
[23:22:26] <Nekomander> Or in a folder dedicated for that 1 software. WITH all the libraries it needs.
[23:22:35] <Nekomander> flatpak does this iirc.
[23:22:48] <goddard> ya and it is ok
[23:23:06] <goddard> Appimage is a bit better but Flatpak is ok

[23:24:25] <Nekomander> You generally have 2 options regardless: 1. Use the globally available shared libraries? This requires root to change and you usually can ONLY have 1 version of this library installed at a time.  Or 2. Redundantly install libraries (this is considered to not be shared libs) that is specifically available for $app, which optionally requires root. This can be in home dir too.
[23:25:01] <goddard> dependency resolution is kind of over engineering
[23:25:18] <goddard> when your goal is to not include the version the app was built with
[23:25:24] <goddard> if it exists already
[23:25:54] <goddard> Nekomander: you are stating commonly known paradigms today not what I am talking about which is the way it should be done today
[23:26:16] <Nekomander> I would argue that this is in some way the Window's approach. A lot of libs packed .exes
[23:26:24] <goddard> and Mac
[23:26:31] <goddard> Appimage is a lot like a DMG
[23:26:39] <goddard> or a portable EXE
[23:27:20] <goddard> go download a flatpak for LibreOffice and then download the Appimage.  The difference you save is 35 MB
[23:27:39] <goddard> Not worth the extra hassle and software development time that went into everything
[23:27:47] <goddard> could of jsut wget and been done with it

[23:31:29] <BadAdviceCat> Isn't this what virtualenv capable of doing? It does place all the needed libs in 1 directory.
[23:32:26] <goddard> if that is what it was designed to do then why do you need a virtual environment?
[23:32:48] <goddard> its a bandaid
[23:33:49] <BadAdviceCat> I do not see how it is a bandaid, the impression I've got from it is that the whole entire point is to avoid using the libraries installed globally.
[23:34:51] <goddard> yes it has a reason of being used but i am not talking about its reason I am talking about why it is annoying and that if they just designed it correctly you wouldn't need it in the first place
[23:35:12] <goddard> but python is old
[23:35:21] <goddard> maybe the devs then had different things to consider
[23:36:50] <BadAdviceCat> Isn't php and js/node libs the same way as python?
[23:37:42] <goddard> depends how deep you go i think until you get into the legacy way of doing things
[23:37:54] <goddard> if you gotta compile php then ya
[23:38:17] <goddard> ever had to use imagmagick
[23:38:21] <goddard> or those libraries
[23:38:26] <goddard> need specific versions and stuff
[23:38:46] <BadAdviceCat> I'm talking about userland libraries.
[23:38:55] <goddard> its all in my vendor folder
[23:39:17] <goddard> it doesn't care about anything other then the folders you tell it to care about
[23:39:34] <BadAdviceCat> I'm not seeing the difference. Userland Libs written in x language, all neatly contained in a folder for Y project.
[23:40:42] <goddard> well usually i don't install composer packages globally and worry about conflicts with other composer packages
[23:40:46] <goddard> do you?
[23:41:02] <BadAdviceCat> I don't. I thought this is what virtualenv is doing.
[23:42:09] <goddard> i think python's packages are probably doing a lot more then a composer package
[23:42:19] <goddard> "package"
[23:42:33] <BadAdviceCat> Python needs its way to decide which python interpreter it is using.
[23:43:19] <BadAdviceCat> IIRC. I'm not going to pretend to know all the details. But the way I see it. virtualenv + pip === composer

[23:46:27] <BadAdviceCat> relipse, check network tab in dev tools to see if the CSS/pictures 404-ing, and then you should be able to fix it.
[23:46:54] <goddard> if you are on local then don't worry about it relipse
[23:47:29] <relipse> if i look at it on firefox it works fine

[23:47:41] <BadAdviceCat> The URLs may need to update to so that it will always use the same http or https url schemes
[23:48:02] <BadAdviceCat> I mean, the same scheme you've used to browse to your .test domain.
[23:50:56] <BadAdviceCat> relipse, do let us know what the network tab shows for the images you're trying to view.
[23:52:13] <relipse> BadAdviceCat: I already gave up on Chrome , now I'm working with firefox
[23:52:55] <goddard> BadAdviceCat: I think the biggest difference is if you need to use another lib or write low level code with php you create an extension
[23:54:03] <goddard> then that extension/lib is attached to php so your project won't care
[23:54:33] <goddard> ive never installed an actual c library or php extension with composer it just warns you if you don't have it installed and working with php
[23:59:03] <BadAdviceCat> relipse, you should really solve that problem though. The way I see it, the less errors in software, and the less possibility of errors, the better.
[23:59:52] <BadAdviceCat> Compare the URLs in network tab that opened, and the urls that failed. Look into the HTML source and compare the HTML that loaded the images, and which didn't/
