[12:55:09] <zilti[m]> Well, I didn't order that one, I got it at the burrito place I sometimes go to. They stick the sticker of the meat you chose onto the paper wrapping
[12:55:50] <zilti[m]> I've also put one on our office water tap. You know... because "WasserHAHN".

[14:29:38] <Irvise> Quick question. Has anybody tried to compile Chicken for WASM and served it as a demo?
[14:30:06] <Bunny351> people have compiled it with enscripten, IIRC, but I don't know how well it worked
[14:30:19] <Irvise> I am asking since I just saw the Draw Harness demo from OpenCASCADE, which is pretty cool.
[14:30:34] <Irvise> Good 'nough :)
[14:30:44] <Irvise> Cool to see that ^^
[14:32:52] <sjamaan> ISTR reading somewhere that repl.it uses CHICKEN compiled with emscripten
[14:32:57] <sjamaan> Maybe I'm wrong though

[15:13:55] <mario-goulart> I have compiled a CHICKEN program with emscripten, but it didn't work.  It was a rather complicated program, though.
