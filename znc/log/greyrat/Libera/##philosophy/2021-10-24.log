[00:10:10] <biys> how i argue is just to bombard a person with links
[00:10:24] <biys> i tell them to read the things i've read and gleam from them the same gleamings i've had
[00:10:33] <biys> i'm totally joking here
[00:10:54] <biys> this was a play off what causative was saying to Player001 yesterday
[00:11:27] <biys> i find most debates act ually end up with people talking over eachother
[00:11:40] <biys> the debate isn't so that the two people can come to any further understanding
[00:11:45] <biys> it's just a show they're putting on for their audience
[00:11:59] <biys> so they speak their narrative to their audience, in the crowd
[00:12:12] <biys> which is why i'm a big fan of the steelmanning technique when it comes to debating
[00:12:26] <biys> where you discuss the other persons narrative prior to elaborating on your own

[00:13:35] <biys> but with the Q stuff it's more-so a theory of the world
[00:13:48] <biys> where if you're debating my understanding of the world you're invalidating my experiences and my understanding
[00:13:55] <biys> it seems rational that a person would be angry about something like that
[00:14:02] <biys> as, like i said, you're invalidating their experiences
[00:14:32] <biys> you're invalidating their understanding of the world
[00:14:38] <biys> you're essentially telling them they're stupid
[00:14:43] <biys> which i mean.  tread lightly
[00:14:46] <biys> you could get punched in the teeth
[00:15:02] <biys> this is not a lack of rational to me
[00:15:06] <Player001> the Q stuff is basically paranoia
[00:15:15] <Player001> in the psychoanalytic sense
[00:15:27] <biys> sure, i could see that
[00:16:15] <dude12312414> telling someone their understanding is wrong is not the same as telling them they are stupid
[00:16:32] <biys> care to elborate on that?
[00:16:51] <dude12312414> this is basically what happens all the time in science
[00:16:53] <biys> i would say that telling someone that their understanding of the world is almost the same as teling them they are stupid
[00:17:04] <biys> understanding of the world is incorrect
[00:17:18] <biys> you're telling them that the senses they've used to understand the world aren't accurate
[00:17:22] <biys> what are you telling them then?
[00:17:40] <biys> you're either telling them that they aren't smart enough to perceive properly
[00:17:48] <biys> or you're telling them that their perceivers are brokenn
[00:18:48] <Player001> basically paranoia is totalizing
[00:19:01] <Player001> everything is read through the paranoia
[00:19:02] <biys> it could be a psychological defect
[00:19:11] <biys> liiiike.  catastrophizing for example
[00:19:11] <dude12312414> it can be a lack of knowledge about something, which can be fixed by learning about that.
[00:19:44] <biys> telling someone they lack the knowledge to understand something is the same as telling them they're stupid

[02:01:37] <ro-bot-o> [url] Logic - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy | www.philosophybasics.com
[02:02:02] <thunder> ^ not all forms of logic are applicable to the same situations
[02:16:35] <Player001> elenchus is a demand for love
[02:17:22] <Player001> a demand for recognition from the other
[02:17:33] <thunder> love is simply the emotional dimension of the urge to copy/mix which is built into the life force
[02:17:55] <Player001> well I don't exactly agree with that
[02:17:59] <thunder> it demands that we see ourselves reflected in the eyes of another
[02:18:25] <Player001> well, "elenchus" is a demand for recognition from the other
[02:18:41] <thunder> Player001: true. I wasn't being rigorous with that statement. love can be quite a bit more. but as an emotion at least, I feel that's true
[02:18:54] <Player001> yeah
[02:19:45] <Player001> anyway, on IRC we might say trying to do elenchus is demanding recognition from the Other
[02:20:17] <thunder> in the same way that we have the built-in urge to reproduce bodily in order to maintain our species', we also have the urge to reproduce our psyche through a similar copy/mix process. our sense of satisfaction is derived from recognizing success in that endeavour
[02:20:43] <thunder> ie. seeing our own thoughts/feelings reflected in another
[02:21:02] <biys> well idk.  i would say that it's happened time and time again
[02:21:10] <biys> wars, levels of fighting based on beliefs
[02:21:34] <Player001> I guess when Lacan say that all demand is a demand for love he means something different from what you mean by love
[02:21:39] <biys> look at sarah and hagar
[02:21:52] <Player001> in this instance love is reduced to recognition
[02:21:59] <thunder> Player001: having any discussion whatsoever is demanding recognition from the other. otherwise why not just shout your philosophical queries into a pillow?
[02:22:42] <thunder> Player001: I'm still working through making sense of lacan, so I don't want to get ahead of myself by addressing that in ignorance
[02:23:24] <biys> causative: why is it irrational to punch someone who questions your believes?
[02:23:33] <biys> that isn't what i was suggesting
[02:23:40] <biys> but i'm interested now that you're making this claim
[02:23:58] <causative> because you aren't engaging with them with your faculty of reason
[02:24:03] <causative> you're responding with emotion and your fists
[02:24:35] <biys> we're supposing it's emotional instead of just an inherent intolerance of a view?
[02:24:46] *** Joins: shibboleth (~shibbolet@user/shibboleth)
[02:25:38] <biys> would we say the war going on in israel is simply chalked up as emotion?

[02:26:37] *** Joins: choozy (~choozy@75-63-174-82.ftth.glasoperator.nl)
[02:27:11] <biys> the reason might be simply an intolerance of ta particular view or another though
[02:27:20] <Player001> in a lot of discussions we have some sort of endpoint we want to attain
[02:27:21] <causative> there's always "a" reason
[02:27:32] <causative> that doesn't mean the *faculty* of reason is engaged
[02:27:41] <causative> even in a blind rage, a person has reasons for acting the way he does
[02:27:49] <Player001> causative, biys, maybe we shouldn't use the Israel conflict as an example
[02:28:12] <biys> Player001: it's likely to trigger someone
[02:28:45] <Player001> I am not inclined to say we are all on the same page as regards the historical facts of the conflict
[02:28:52] <Player001> so it might complicate things
[02:29:16] <biys> i would also say that your presuppositions about how people ought to act, causative aren't necessarily based in any kind of reality.  the fact of the matter is people do act this way.  as a result of people acting this way it is completely reasonable
[02:29:20] <biys> it isn't unreasonable
[02:29:35] <biys> it is within the realm of possibilities
[02:30:02] <causative> "reasonable" doesn't mean "within the realm of possibilities"
[02:30:13] <causative> driving your car on the sidewalk is within the realm of possibilities

[02:33:17] <biys> it has teeth doesn't it?
[02:33:26] <Player001> of course in this example Israel is the specific dog
[02:34:10] <Player001> and "when I was younger" is like five minutes ago
[02:34:15] <biys> i grew up around dogs and was never attacked by dogs but i'm completely aware of the fact that dogs can bite
[02:34:25] <biys> it is unreasonable to assume that a dog will not bite you
[02:34:29] <biys> "they have teeth don't they?"
[02:34:32] <causative> sure and cars can crash into you
[02:34:38] <causative> do you have a fear of cars?
[02:34:52] <Inline> ofc
[02:34:57] <biys> yes
[02:35:10] <biys> every time i get in a car i realize that there is a possibility i could be part of an accident
[02:35:18] <Inline> when the motor chip hops on you and bites your ass......
[02:35:20] <causative> that's not the same as having a *fear* of it
[02:35:22] <causative> fear is an emotion
[02:35:22] <Inline> lol
[02:35:32] <causative> recognizing the possibility of an accident is not the same as fear
[02:35:51] <Inline> horrible horrible
[02:35:52] <biys> sure, i'm afraid.  but i'm brave
[02:35:53] <Inline> hahaha
[02:36:01] <causative> does your heart pound faster, do you feel uncomfortable and wish to be anywhere else, when you get into a car?
[02:36:10] <causative> if so, you have an irrational phobia of cars
[02:36:32] <causative> if not, you don't fear cars, you just recognize that there is a danger
[02:37:34] <biys> well what is the recognition of danger i guess?
[02:37:39] <biys> how do we perceive danger?
[02:37:53] <causative> you can perceive it intellectually without being afraid of it
[02:38:02] <causative> not all perception of danger is fear
[02:38:03] <biys> the recognition of danger is essentially the fear of somethign bad happening to us
[02:38:13] <biys> realizing that we can be harmed
[02:38:18] <biys> and not wanting to succumb to harm
[02:38:23] <biys> i'd say that it "fear"
[02:38:27] <biys> if we were truly "fearless"
[02:38:30] <biys> it would be a death sentence
[02:38:30] <causative> fear is perception of danger, but not all perception of danger is fear
[02:38:31] <biys> IMO
[02:38:55] <biys> if we were truly FEARLESS we'd act within the world signficantly different
[02:39:43] <biys> is it the laws that hold me back from driving like a maniac?
[02:40:00] <biys> or is it the recognition that as a result of driving like a maniac i could succumb to some kind of peril?
[02:40:06] <biys> "fear"
[02:41:15] <biys> if i do out and engage in risky behaviour the likelihood that something bad could happen increases
[02:41:26] <biys> so out of fear of that bad happening i act within a reasonable set of boundaries
[02:41:39] <biys> which could include being cautious of dogs
[02:41:46] <biys> as i don't want to be bitten by a dog
[02:41:48] <biys> because that hurts
[02:41:55] <biys> it's fear that is driving that
[02:42:43] <biys> it's why alcohol is liquid courage
[02:42:53] <biys> it makes you less fearful i'd say
[02:42:59] <biys> or perhaps less likely to recognize potential hazards
[02:43:24] <biys> i don't disagree with you though...  i kind of agree with you
[02:45:06] <thunder> thinking about reason as inherently about making a decision, choice or judgement, then what reason is at base is simply finding that comparison among differences which is most similar to the object of desire
[02:46:18] <thunder> that reasons plural chain or cluster together and follow from one another is a given. but while we may have a reason on the surface, we may not be fully conscious of all the underlying reasons in support of the immediate superficial one
[02:46:41] <biys> sure
[02:46:44] <biys> it could be completely irrational
[02:46:51] <biys> which is why i said i agree and disagree
[02:47:12] <causative> thunder, to some extent yes, but we need to make a distinction between the higher cognitive faculty of reason - and other things the brain does, that *also* make decisions based on achieving a desire
[02:47:24] <causative> reason is a *particular* kind of way to make those decisions

[03:06:40] <thunder> I was thinking that the phallus represents competition and all the emotions (envy, jealous, avarice, etc) which stem from that when desire becomes unfettered
[03:07:11] <thunder> competition for love/recognition
[03:08:10] <Player001> phallus is the signifier of lack
[03:08:57] <thunder> okay
[03:09:01] <Player001> which also opens up the space for language
[03:11:39] <thunder> the crux being that when the baby is born it experiences for the first time a material separation from the other. to me that's the fundamental lack, the sudden shock of being disconnected and exposed to the elements, pain in particular. that is what drives the desire for reconnection. that is followed with the mirror stage in which the ego is born, and by the competition (in traditional families) with the father for the mother's affection.
[03:12:54] <thunder> this isn't lacan. just my riffing off that in comparison with my own experience

[03:17:36] <Player001> the mirror stage is basically the recognition of the self as whole, which is a fiction
[03:17:41] <thunder> like it occurred to me yesterday while smoking a cigarette that the feeling of the smoke in my lungs was like amniotic fluid, and the rush in my blood was reminiscent of the warmth and vibration of my mother's shared circulation
[03:18:30] <thunder> I thought perhaps my affinity for smoking was a seeking for reconnection or reinsertion into the womb
[03:19:24] <Player001> the (mis)identification of this object which I see as whole, and saying, "that is me"
[03:21:06] <thunder> sure. we would only be able to recognise that the shape we are looking at is our own body, by referencing the shapes of bodies of others (family) who look similar. which follows all throughout life in the process of ego formation
[03:23:24] <thunder> Player001: so the milk, is that petit autre?
[03:23:52] <thunder> is it the milk, or the image/fantasy of it's jouissance in our mind?
[03:26:28] <Player001> the objet petit a is not any one object
[03:30:23] <thunder> what is the distinction between objet petit a and the phallus?

[03:32:31] <thunder> I'm pretty sure I have the most basic concepts understood, but I'm still a bit confused about the labels for each.
[03:33:14] <Player001> objet petit a is the object cause of desire
[03:33:26] <Player001> phallus is the signifier of lack which underpins language
[03:34:52] <thunder> object cause of desire is the features/qualities that we hope the real object will possess?

[03:36:07] <Player001> on the graph of desire we have $--i(a)-->A--Che vuoi? and d-->($<>a)
[03:36:23] <thunder> causative: lacan basically sets up a bunch of signifiers for various ideas within the internal diagram of the psyche he's devised. it's not a literal phallus
[03:36:50] <thunder> it's his symbol for the idea of "lack" in the most profound sense
[03:37:27] <Player001> Che vuoi? mean "what do you want?"
[03:38:30] <thunder> what is the barred signifier? what does the bar indicate?
[03:38:48] <thunder> my impression is that the bar is the phallus
[03:39:14] <Player001> no barred S ($) is the subject
[03:39:25] <thunder> right. subject. okay. what is the subject
[03:39:40] <thunder> pardon my conflation
[03:40:20] <thunder> is that subject as in subject/predicate?
[03:40:31] <Player001> subject of the unconscious
[03:40:43] <thunder> you'll need to elaborate
[03:41:03] <Player001> the subject is the subject which speaks
[03:41:08] <Player001> it says "I"
[03:41:27] <thunder> so it's the latent psyche of the individual?
[03:41:32] <Player001> sorry, I am going to elaborate more
[03:42:08] <Player001> for Lacan, the subject speaks through the ego
[03:42:21] <Player001> the ego is the subject spoken of
[03:42:48] <thunder> so the subject is the true I rather than it's imaginary representation?
[03:42:54] <Player001> the subject is also fundamentally a product of the symbolic order
[03:43:19] <Player001> yes, it is a void
[03:43:49] <thunder> alright. but if it is a void, then how does anything emerge from it?
[03:44:50] <thunder> rn my grasp of the terminology is still pretty shakey. I'm getting that symbol, unconscious, and the bit Other are relatively synonymous
[03:45:01] <thunder> *big Other
[03:45:42] <Player001> not exactly synonymous
[03:46:05] <Player001> it's totally ok though. Lacan is aprocess
[03:46:09] <Player001> *a process
[03:46:16] <thunder> in other words that a symbol or semantic element doesn't have meaning of it's own, except in relation to some predicate which through the process of judgement makes it meaningful.
[03:46:54] <thunder> judgement being hegel's word I guess. not sure what lacan used in that context
[03:47:10] <Player001> Lacan and Hegel are very similar but a little different

[05:31:41] <thunder> or if it gets too bad, pisses/shits on the floor
[05:32:28] <Player001> true, there is a certain 'as if'
[05:32:38] <thunder> I think animals do have very rich symbolism, and in many cases attempt to communicate with humans. but we are so used to looking at ourselves as superior and defining everything from a humanocentric frame, that we exclude many of those obvious correlations from our recognition
[05:32:54] <Player001> it is as if they talk to us
[05:33:06] <thunder> I don't think it's an illusion
[05:33:14] <thunder> when the dog asks for food, it's pretty obvious
[05:34:05] <thunder> hypothetically, how would you extend lacan's psychological framework to other creatures which exhibit reasoning and singing behaviour?
[05:38:22] <thunder> I'm remembering fondly several occasions on the beach where the seagulls came over to me sitting with a bunch of bags, and asked for food, which I refused since I didn't have any. then the alpha set one to watch me in case I was lying. later I pull out a bag to roll a dube and the watchbird starts freaking out and squawking at me because I sad no, but suddenly produced something that looks vaguely food like, and calls the whole flock over to harass
[05:38:22] <thunder> me about my stinginess. so many times.
[05:39:09] <thunder> they get really indignant if they think you're not sharing
[05:41:06] <Player001> it is very true that the animal expresses need
[05:41:27] <Player001> but demand not so much
[05:45:47] <thunder> then perhaps given that we are animals with much the same physilogical equipment and impulses, are also strongly expressive of need, in addition to the ephemeral desires which may displace from one object to the next
[05:47:21] <thunder> like is a demand, and symbolic order, not similar to tool use? wouldn't that make some primates and birds like the calidonia crow, also follow a similar process of thought?
[05:47:49] <thunder> and if that is true, can lacan extroplate to their decision making process?
[05:50:37] <thunder> we as*
[05:55:05] <causative> the trouble with saying that a signifier's meaning comes from its relation to other signifiers, is that it fails to say what the meaning of the signifier *is*
[05:55:13] <thunder> something that occurs to me in the way I've looked at the subject up until now, is that there are drives associated with the body, which I call need. they occur in the present in the form of pain, and the pleasure from satisfaction of need. but the psyche is not limited to awareness of a present. it also encompasses a context of time, where comparison and choice become past and future respectively, and pain/pleasure seeds fear/desire in that
[05:55:14] <thunder> extratemporal context.
[05:55:35] <causative> "What color is your car?"  "Well, the color of my car comes from the spray nozzles in the car factory."  "Okay... but what color is it?"
[05:56:18] <Player001> causative: you what the signified
[05:56:22] <Player001> *want
[05:56:23] <thunder> thus since desire has this not here/now quality, it in itself will never be dissipated
[05:56:59] <thunder> unless the desire is directed first and foremost to satisfaction of need in the here/now
[05:57:32] <causative> sure I do Player001 , if there is a signified - I prefer the word "meaning" because it does not require that every signifier name an actually existent object
[05:58:03] <causative> and what is the concrete relationship between the relation of the signifier to other signifiers, and the meaning of the signifier? this is the missing element
[05:58:17] <causative> or between the "signified" if there is one, if you wish
[05:59:19] <thunder> if I say "happiness" that is a signifier, but happiness is a feeling setting the simarity of criteria one's present feeling must match in order to qualify. that criteria is the meaning.
[06:01:24] <Player001> this may be of some help causative: https://nosubject.com/Signifier
[06:01:25] <ro-bot-o> [url] Signifier - No Subject - Encyclopedia of Psychoanalysis - Encyclopedia of Lacanian Psychoanalysis | nosubject.com
[06:01:35] <causative> no I don't think so
[06:01:40] <thunder> just like a "chair" is a object to be sat upon, but no exclusive to any one object shape or form. a chair is a function/criteria rather than an object in it's self.
[06:01:42] <Player001> basically there is no relationship of the kind you want
[06:02:05] <causative> what a load of crap
[06:02:06] <Player001> LOL
[06:02:16] <causative> yes, there is such a relationship
[06:02:32] <causative> Lacan doesn't know it, and you don't know it, but I have some ideas
[06:02:36] <thunder> we could call a chair a "foo" instead, but as long as "foo" has the same criteria as "chair" their meaning remains consistent.
[06:02:51] <Player001> causative: LMAO
[06:03:35] <causative> it's intellectual cowardice to say "because I don't know the answer, there is no such answer."
[06:03:46] <thunder> hence we can translate between languages, from one arbitrary symbol set to another, with relatively little loss of superficial meaning
[06:04:14] <causative> if the meaning of a symbol comes from its network of relationships with other symbols - and if the meaning of a symbol refers to something particular, such as an object it signifies - then we must be able to derive one from the other
[06:04:22] <Player001> causative: I look forward to the day you go to college
[06:05:31] <Player001> since you are clearly in high school
[06:06:04] <thunder> causative: a child goes walking with the mother, who points her finger down and says "stick", then picks up the object and hands it to the child. soon the child will go and say "stick", point at something and pick it up. mom says "no, that's a pebble. 'pebble'." and puts it down. over time the child learns to differentiate and associate each set of sounds, then eventually written characters.
[06:06:35] <thunder> the relation between signifier and signified is mainly memorization of arbitrary correspondences
[06:07:19] <causative> thunder, the contents of the child's memory is just the network of relationships between signifiers that we already were talking about
[06:07:28] <causative> you have described how this network forms, you have not said how it relates to the object
[06:07:46] <thunder> "arbitrary correspondences"
[06:07:57] <Player001> causative: you want the signified
[06:09:03] <thunder> causative: here's a non-arbitrary example. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia
[06:09:03] <ro-bot-o> [url] Onomatopoeia - Wikipedia | en.wikipedia.org
[06:09:24] <causative> but what *is* the correspondence, thunder?
[06:09:29] <causative> to say it is arbitrary is not to say what it is
[06:09:43] <Player001> it is nothing
[06:09:48] <causative> it is not nothing
[06:10:18] <causative> we know that words mean things
[06:10:40] <causative> we know that they mean things because of how they reside in our mental structures
[06:10:42] <thunder> causative: I can't answer that. it's maybe something like godel's incompletenesses. I can describe "what is", but I can't describe necessarily say why? like why do we exist in the first place? I have no clue. but I know we do.
[06:10:58] <causative> but it's difficult to say how the manner of their residence relates to the things that they mean
[06:11:43] <Player001> 'Whereas Saussure argues that the signifier and the signified are mutually interdependent, Lacan states that the signifier is primary and produces the signified.
[06:11:43] <Player001> The signifier is first of all a meaningless material element in a closed differential system; this "signifier without the signified" is called by Lacan the "pure signifier", though this is a question of logical rather than chronological precedence.
[06:11:43] <Player001> "Every real signifier is, as such, a signifier that signifies nothing. The more the signifier signifies nothing, the more indestructible it is."'
[06:12:21] <thunder> there's survival advantage to being able to communicate. we cry to get a tit or our diaper changed, etc. eventually we desire to communicate more specific things, and so we seek to immitate the communication of others in order to facilitate those desires.
[06:12:51] <causative> when you don't know something, intellectual courage is to say you don't know it
[06:13:07] <causative> intellectual cowardice is either to pretend you know it anyway, or to deny that there is anything to know
[06:13:10] <Player001> OK, then say it
[06:14:29] <thunder> "god" is a good example of a signifier which most signifies nothing. until someone clearly defines what it means, it's just meaningless gibberish.
[06:14:50] <causative> let me give you an example, thunder ; suppose we have a simple robot that has a database, and in this database there may be propositions, such as "I have a cookie."
[06:15:19] <causative> suppose, furthermore, that this robot is infallible; when it thinks it has a cookie, it does in fact have one
[06:15:56] * thunder nods
[06:15:58] <causative> in this case, the meaning of the proposition "I have a cookie" in the robot's database is the state of affairs in which the robot does have a cookie - that is, the set of all situations in which the robot has the cookie
[06:16:20] <causative> which is the set of all situations in which the robot has the *proposition* "I have a cookie"
[06:16:58] <causative> or in general, the meaning of a proposition in the robot's database can be identified with the set of all material situations in which the robot has that proposition in its database - because the robot is infallible
[06:17:28] <causative> humans are not infallible, so a theory of meaning for humans must be more complex than that
[06:18:19] <causative> but that is a simple idea that connects the structure of relationships within an agent's mind, to the external meaning of a proposition in the agent's mind
[06:19:02] <causative> for humans, we might say that the meaning of a proposition is the set of situations in which the human would hold that proposition, *if* that human, counterfactually, were infallible with respect to that proposition
[06:19:26] <thunder> say you have a table named "I have" with columns "type" (string) and "number" (integer). "I have a cookie" could take the form of a row in that table of ("cookie", 1)
[06:19:59] <causative> I make no assumptions about how the database is structured; it's not necessary to make such assumptions
[06:20:23] <Player001> basically it is enough to say wtf was the point of that thought experiment
[06:20:23] <causative> it could be a single flat table of strings, or it could be deeply nested - it doesn't matter
[06:20:43] <causative> because the meaning in any case comes from the set of situations in which the proposition is held
[06:20:53] <causative> assuming that the proposition is held correctly
[06:21:13] <causative> also note that this only assigns meaning to *propositions*, not to individual terms within propositions
[06:22:16] <thunder> I'm not sure this answers your question causative, but lacan has a "graph of desire" (actually several) which detail the process of signification, and it's impacts and shortcuts via the subconscious. I feel that might offer some insight if you look into it.
[06:22:32] <thunder> s/subconscious/unconscious
[06:22:32] <ro-bot-o> thunder meant to say: I'm not sure this answers your question causative, but lacan has a "graph of desire" (actually several) which detail the process of signification, and it's impacts and shortcuts via the unconscious. I feel that might offer some insight if you look into it.
[06:23:52] <causative> for diagrams of the mind I would rather read Minsky than Lacan
[06:24:04] <Player001> "the robot has a cookie" is true if and only if the robot has a cookie
[06:24:35] <thunder> causative: I think cognitive dissonance and weighted averages seem to be a way of looking at it. I am still fledgling in the subject's formal terminology, but I tend to view it as a cloud of venn diagrams.

[06:24:58] <thunder> in other words what may seem on the surface as a binary choice, isn't
[06:25:21] <causative> human thought is not binary
[06:25:31] <causative> it's fuzzy and probabilistic and heuristic and pragmatic
[06:25:39] <thunder> exactly
[06:26:25] <thunder> even so, no matter how knotted and spaghetti like, I feel there can still be a describable flow to how signification occurs
[06:26:30] <causative> the brain is a whole lot of little committees that compete with one another, and whatever seems to be having more "success" gains influence
[06:27:15] <thunder> ever see how a spider spins a web, and binds the different directions of strands together at various intersections?
[06:27:39] <Player001> quilting point?
[06:27:39] <thunder> to me that's a good metaphor for thought or decision, meaning
[06:27:50] <causative> I've never actually seen a spider spin a web
[06:28:01] <causative> got plenty of spiders around here but they don't do their work in front of me
[06:28:14] <thunder> the're probably loads of time lapse on yt. also various spiders. but I mean like orb weaver's
[06:28:57] <thunder> the classic halloween spider web pattern
[06:29:11] <thunder> or spiderman logo
[06:31:05] <causative> well, I have seen videos of it
[06:32:31] <causative> also, this notion of a "network" of signifiers is itself a great simplification that is not strictly accurate
[06:33:21] <Player001> how so
[06:33:34] <thunder> no. we can only describe the general categories and broad pattern/sequence, not the minutia
[06:33:47] <causative> the brain isn't organized in such a strict, symbolic way
[06:34:00] <Player001> we're not talking about the brain
[06:34:37] <causative> the brain represents what we call a "symbol" by a huge vector of millions or billions of neurons firing together in a certain pattern
[06:34:37] <Player001> or I'm not
[06:34:50] <thunder> on some level the brain must be organized in a strict symbolic way, or it wouldn't function as a reservoir memory and habitual behaviour
[06:34:51] <causative> different symbols are different patterns
[06:35:05] <causative> this activity does not have the structure of links, like hyperlinks in a computer - it's not that rigidly structured
[06:35:55] <causative> it's difficult to explain
[06:36:50] <thunder> I'm not sure going into neuroscience adds much to the discussion unless we can reference specific neuroscience findings which are relevant to the thesis of discussion
[06:36:58] <causative> the associations are like those that we find in a Boltzmann machine
[06:37:02] <Player001> s/we're/I'm
[06:37:02] <ro-bot-o> Player001 meant to say: I'm not talking about the brain
[06:37:36] <causative> patterns are associated with each other in a probabilistic manner, such that even just counting the number of patterns is not something rigorously possible
[06:37:57] <Player001> good thing we don't have to
[06:38:00] <causative> if pattern A is associated with pattern B, it's not represented by a strict edge in a graph like A <-> B
[06:38:24] <causative> it's represented by a tendency of the brain to produce pattern B when stimulated with pattern A, or vice versa
[06:39:01] <causative> but the set of patterns the brain could be stimulated with is vast - not finite, not countable.  It's a very large-dimensional, continuous vector space.
[06:39:33] <causative> these are our symbols: all the elements of the vector space.  Some areas of the vector space come up more often than other, because they are more strongly associated with the stimuli the brain encounters
[06:39:59] <causative> but they aren't something you can count, or draw a discrete graph for
[06:40:48] <causative> the graphs you can draw are only very crude approximations to this enormous vector space of brain patterns that stimulate other brain patterns
[06:40:56] <thunder> A doesn't need to be an individual thing. it can be a cluster of meanings like a group/set/category. like if I say E=mc^2. E is one thing, but it is also the idea of multipication between m, c and c again. when referring to E, the mc^2 is implicitly included
[06:41:52] <causative> that's changing the subject, but no, that's not the right way to think about it
[06:42:06] <thunder> but it doesn't need to be a very precise value either. if I say "put the fish in the bucket", until you see the fish, you don't know if it's one fish or many fish.
[06:42:19] <causative> suppose we instead wrote E - mc^2 = 0
[06:42:29] <causative> it's the same equation, but now both terms are on the left
[06:42:51] <causative> are we to say that when referring to 0, the "E - mc^2" is always implicitly included?
[06:42:54] <causative> that's not really sensible
[06:43:13] *** Joins: Populus (~emil.a.jo@c-afbbe455.021-17-6b6c6d1.bbcust.telenor.se)
[06:43:26] <causative> it's better to say that E, m, and c are three different terms in a relation with each other
[06:43:34] <causative> a ternary relation
[06:43:36] <thunder> causative: when I say black, all black things are implicitly included, even if I can't immediately innumerate them
[06:43:55] <causative> no they aren't
[06:44:06] <causative> when you say "that car is black," you are not implicitly including all black things
[06:44:08] <causative> only the car
[06:45:09] <thunder> "the car is" does the exclusion, not the word "black"
[06:45:28] <causative> there's no exclusion if you don't imagine including everything to begin with
[06:45:33] <causative> "black" doesn't mean "things that are black"
[06:45:42] <causative> it's an adjective, not a set of nouns
[06:45:44] <thunder> no. it is a criteria for comparison
[06:46:10] *** Quits: choozy (~choozy@75-63-174-82.ftth.glasoperator.nl) (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
[06:46:14] <causative> take another example, x^2 + y^2 = 1, the equation of the unit circle
[06:46:44] <causative> this is not a function - and we cannot rearrange it to say x = sqrt(1 - y^2) and then claim that whenever we mention x we always mean sqrt(1 - y^2)
[06:47:07] <causative> it can only be thought of as a *relation* between x and y
[06:47:23] <causative> for almost every x there are two different y that satisfy it
[06:47:45] <causative> and for almost every y there are two different x that satisfy it
[06:47:58] <causative> the x is not contained or implicit in the y, nor vice versa - they are different variables
[06:48:03] <causative> bound together by the relation
[06:48:28] <thunder> all things which match that criteria are included. take pareidolia for example. I was out having a smoke the other night, and I heard a bird chirp. I thought it was calling me "idiot", but it was just my mind constructing meaning from something which had similar syllable and tonal structure. the sound shapes the bird made, implicitly included all similar comparisons, one of which "idiot" popped spontaneously up out of my unconscious in that moment.
[06:49:11] <causative> what the bird chirped, and what you thought, were two different things
[06:49:21] <causative> they sat in relation to each other, but that did not make them equal
[06:49:40] <biys> birds talk to me all the time
[06:49:42] <thunder> they were, but they were associated in the unconscious by virtue of the similarity of their symbol
[06:50:08] <thunder> the criteria for meaning (a similar comparison) occurred spontaneously
[06:52:08] <causative> you can order your thoughts better if you take different things to be truly different, and if there are relationships that bind them together, understand that the relationship is just a third thing, relating two different things, which still remain different
[06:52:34] <thunder> the idea of the symbolic order is that when a person says "a black...", until they finish the sentence, the statement has the implication of matching any/all black objects
[06:53:12] <thunder> sometimes when a statement is vague and has several possible interpretations, that ambiguity lingers
[06:53:19] <Player001> the meaning is metonymically deffered to the end of the sentence
[06:53:35] <Player001> s/deffered/deferred
[06:53:35] <ro-bot-o> Player001 meant to say: the meaning is metonymically deferred to the end of the sentence
[07:07:48] <thunder> let's say a computer has a database of every irc user's conversations stored separately and exclusively, as well as every blog poster, social media post, etc. now the computer indexes all the words in all posts, and assigns each string a value for number times a word is used, and then totals that for each user. it would then be possible for the computer to take an arbitrary string of text, and by doing a similar analysis, come up with all the posts
[07:07:48] <thunder> with highest degree of correlation between words used, and possibly correlate the accounts to each other regardless of username.
[07:08:41] <thunder> even if a computer does that, it's still doing a comparison for highest similarity amongs an arbitrarily large pool of potentials, to that object of desire (the original arbitrary input text)
[07:09:44] <thunder> that doesn't preclude false/positives either

[07:12:25] <thunder> we have designed computers to follow procedures of conditions, even if those procedures are abstracted within asymetrically executing lambda calculus

[07:26:44] <thunder> google used to (don't know if they still do) have this button for "I'm feeling lucky". I think this is roughly what the memory tries to do. when we observe things, their identity is filed away under a bunch of characteristics which may in turn become parts of a conditional statement defining how to recognise that entity and/or it's function. then when we go and search for "car" in the database, it will spit out the closest predetermined match with a
[07:26:45] <thunder> certain weight threshold (we could call emotional intensity or passion).

[17:51:10] <ruzu> i think that becomes very subjective, depends on your target audience?
[17:51:29] <moniker-> of course that is why i'm asking for *your* subjective opinion
[17:51:36] <ruzu> oh, okay
[17:51:47] <ruzu> if i didn't ask for the email it's spam to me
[17:51:55] <moniker-> how would i be able to ask you for your *objective* opinion?
[17:52:34] <moniker-> so unsolicited would be one attribute then
[17:52:40] * wodencafe emails ruzu about joining the Church of Scientology for the low price of $69,420, from rgrwoaawgoawrughwr@uhgu.net
[17:53:07] <moniker-> and this is specific to emails right?
[17:53:11] <wodencafe> Not all unsolicited emails are spam.
[17:53:16] <ruzu> "objective" spam attributes... just don't look like what people think of is classically spam
[17:53:26] <moniker-> like if we were commenting here, you didn't ask for my comments are my comments spam?
[17:54:12] <wodencafe> This is a discussion involving philosophical inquiry, which is on topic for the channel as per https://pastebin.com/raw/a8FVrqQL

[17:54:44] <ruzu> so, don't mispell things, use proper english, have a link to your org somewhere, include a real first name and last name. I guess sound professional or corporate. If you have graphics that work/show in email, great. You should also have a clear guise or purpose for the email being sent to them
[17:55:01] <moniker-> so if 'unsolicited' attribute is specific to emails why is it specific to emails but not other forms of communication?
[17:55:38] <moniker-> if we understood that maye we could universalize attribute more than just specific to emails
[17:55:51] <wodencafe> I have friends that I exchange messages with that don't contain proper english, sometimes have typos, do not have links to my org, include my real first or last name, sound professional, corporate. Noen of those things.

[18:00:40] <moniker-> ye that's ok, so lets look further
[18:00:57] <moniker-> and it doesn't have to be single attribute right?
[18:01:08] <moniker-> what other comes to mind?
[18:01:17] <wodencafe> If one knew how to classify with some degree of precision a "thing" as either being spam or not spam, one would also know how to craft an undesirable "thing" in a way that could game the same system within the same degree of precision. It's a paradox.

[18:02:03] <wodencafe> There is no correct answer.
[18:02:13] <arryana> it's a pointless question, asked the way it is

[18:03:24] <moniker-> you mean *not* wanting the contact?
[18:03:26] <arryana> if anyone needs a meaningful definition of spam, it's on a use-base case
[18:03:45] <wodencafe> moniker-: As you asked in the premise, you are correct, it's a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it problem.

[18:03:48] <arryana> but this guy doesn't really care, he's just looking to stir
[18:04:16] <ruzu> sounds like he would be better off running a poll
[18:04:28] <moniker-> i would say that is also a spam attribute - you not wanting the contact, it inversly means that spam is what is unwanted
[18:04:35] <wodencafe> arryana: I believe you are correct, but that's just, like, my opinion, man.
[18:05:10] <moniker-> but now i would ask would you really call everything unwanted as spam? or are we again specifically talking only about emails

[18:06:00] <arryana> there are a lot fewer ways of being a troll than there are of being reasonably good company.
[18:06:04] <ruzu> i think of all unwanted grabs of attention as spam
[18:06:18] <ruzu> ads are spam, people can be spam
[18:06:42] <moniker-> but even in emails, lets say your mom sent you unwanted email about how she feels about your recent behavior hypothetically speaking, would you label that as spam tho?
[18:06:47] <ruzu> when someone manipulates rankings/views/etc to show themselves higher on a site -- spam
[18:07:01] <arryana> oh my god
[18:07:02] <wodencafe> ruzu: moniker-'s messages in my opinion are unwanted grabs of attention, but not specifically spam.
[18:07:09] <arryana> someone's mommy tells them off in email.
[18:07:10] <ruzu> xD
[18:07:11] <arryana> that's hilarious
[18:07:21] <moniker-> wodencafe im sorry ill have to put you on ignore
[18:07:33] <ruzu> yeah i have my mom going to a spam folder actually, unironically
[18:07:37] <moniker-> you seem to be dedicated to interrupting and disrupting my conversation with ruzu
[18:07:45] <moniker-> and not in a nice way either
[18:07:59] <wodencafe> moniker-: Thanks for letting the room know, after not responding to me for 15 minutes anyway. I'm sure they will consider this a noteworthy event.
[18:08:03] <ruzu> uegh they're funny
[18:08:04] <arryana> aww, is wodencafe keeping you from monologuing?
[18:08:34] <moniker-> ruzu ah but i would make a distinction between being forced to use preset email folders and your actual mental label triggers, although i may be wrong and maybe that's exactly how you would label it?
[18:09:44] <wodencafe> The interesting part is, I'm providing legitimate responses to the question, and that is a problem for moniker-. That leads me to believe they are insincere in this entire conversation. I think this goes against the channel's first guideline, under "concern-trolling".
[18:09:53] <moniker-> so far two attributes (however faulty) were articulated, unsolicited and unwanted which is pretty much synonymous
[18:10:26] <arryana> trolls never want real engagement.  they just want attention.
[18:10:27] <ruzu> that question makes no sense. I archive her emails and put them in a folder called "fuckoff". So they don't get deleted but I go several years without reading them
[18:10:28] <arryana> a lot of it
[18:10:43] <moniker-> oh i may be wrong actually, since we are getting into semantics
[18:10:49] <wodencafe> They did legitimately put me on ignore though, so at least that was sincere, even if the reason was not.
[18:10:50] <moniker-> unsolicited is not asked for
[18:11:03] <ruzu> i think moniker just isn't the most socially aware lol
[18:11:05] <moniker-> while not everything not asked for is also unwanted
[18:11:11] <moniker-> something not asked for can be wanted
[18:11:13] <pussipupu> Spam is in my experience generally considered to be unsolicited bulk communication
[18:11:27] * arryana spams pussipupu with cats
[18:11:30] <pussipupu> bulk being a key aspect
[18:11:43] <pussipupu> woo!
[18:11:48] <moniker-> bulk meaning usually with some kind of automated method send to many recipients?
[18:12:02] <arryana> and soup.  there's a lot.
[18:12:09] <pussipupu> not necessarily automated though often
[18:12:22] <moniker-> ok
[18:12:32] <moniker-> but to many recipients? that's what you meant?
[18:12:46] <wodencafe> Are ads on television considered spam?
[18:13:08] <wodencafe> I'm interested in having a sincere discussion about the topic.
[18:13:12] <moniker-> is it important that it is exactly same contents for many recipients rather than individualized content?
[18:13:56] <wodencafe> My question was directed to the rest of the room.
[18:14:12] <pussipupu> They generally aren't, but possibly because they're embedded with the permission of the provider
[18:14:13] <pussipupu> also they're older than the Spam sketch :p
[18:14:47] <wodencafe> So it's not spam if the provider says it isn't spam :P
[18:15:40] <pussipupu> the desired content provider
[18:15:46] <pussipupu> .w spam
[18:18:53] <wodencafe> "This is 420 AM, thank you for listening, now here's a word from our sponsor." "Hello, this is SketchCo., LTD and we want you to know how sketchy our Sketchington Mach 2.1 is.

[23:18:03] <causative> knowledge is a *type* of belief
[23:18:21] <causative> wodencafe, that would be 2
[23:18:45] <wodencafe> causative: How do you know this to be true?
[23:19:19] <Digit> ^  *nodding to the question*
[23:19:22] <causative> well I was taught it in kindergarten probably with reference to adding turtles or some such
[23:19:35] <Digit> argument from authority then?
[23:19:38] <causative> and then later I learned some real math and I can tell you what it means in Peano arithmetic
[23:19:52] <causative> and it makes intuitive sense if you understand what the terms mean
[23:21:04] <causative> intuition justifying formalism
[23:21:15] <Digit> so, adding 1 turtle and another turtle, always gives 2 turtles?   ... what if they breed?   (as per my prior example of exception to the thus proven over-simplicity).
[23:21:27] <causative> digit don't make me repeat myself
[23:21:45] <causative> I already explained to you what's wrong with that
[23:21:46] <wodencafe> causative: If you know that 1+1=2, then why was 2+2=4 ever in question?
[23:22:01] <Digit> causative: even looking back, i'm missing it.  where...?
[23:22:08] <causative> <causative> i.e. let's not interpret "add" in the nontechnical sense of placing objects together - to add them is to consider them together without changing them in any way
[23:22:15] <causative> <causative> smashing two apples together is not adding them together
[23:22:46] <Digit> /oh/, ok, /those/ goal posts.  easy win for ye then.  n_n  keep it moving and narrow.  lol.
[23:23:19] <causative> wodencafe, well, 2+2=4 might have taken me slightly longer to figure out than 1+1=2
[23:23:30] <Digit> when not allowed out of those confines, missing all manner more questions and interpretations and outcomes.
[23:23:47] <causative> and there are other addition equations like 234430+2344666=2579096 that are less obvious still

[23:23:56] <causative> we can *doubt* mathematical statements
[23:24:02] <causative> even if they are true in all possible situations
[23:24:05] <wodencafe> causative: Ok, they may take longer to figure out. So what?
[23:24:15] <causative> well, before we've figured them out, we would doubt them
[23:24:37] <causative> once we've figured them out we should still doubt them - because of the possibility of a mistake in calculation - but we should doubt them less, after figuring them out
[23:25:05] <wodencafe> But what is the question?
[23:25:13] <Digit> and why
[23:25:46] <causative> the question is how to assign *meanings* to mathematical claims, in light of the idea that we can assign meaning to claims about the world as the totality of real-world situations in which those claims are true
[23:26:03] <causative> the totality of real-world situations in which mathematical claims are true is "all of them"
[23:26:21] <causative> so that can't be the meaning of the claims
[23:26:41] <Digit> sounds circular cart before horse.

[23:41:41] <causative> *in light of the idea*, doesn't mean we can apply the idea directly
[23:42:05] <causative> it means, form a notion of meaning for mathematics, using similar thinking as the truthmaker notion of meaning for statements about the world
[23:43:02] <causative> on reflection, we need to think about the change in mental state that comes from believing 2+2=4, compared to the mental state in which we don't believe it
[23:43:34] <causative> what can we immediately deduce, now that we know 2+2=4, that we couldn't immediately deduce before?
[23:43:51] <causative> even if we had all the axioms, we couldn't *immediately* deduce all their consequences

[23:47:02] <Digit> why need belief?  when can witness examples so, and examples otherwise.  it needn't be all or none; it needn't be binary believe or don't, nor need only "believe or don't", as "don't" can be non-belief, disbelief, neither, e.g. in oblivion, and believing itself need not be absolute and exclusive.  many other ways.
[23:48:32] <Delf> Variable range of assumption based on calculations of previously collected data
[23:48:36] <wodencafe> causative: Why is it important for the deduction to be immediate?
