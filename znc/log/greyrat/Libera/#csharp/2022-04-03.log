[06:24:00] <smallville7123_> why does java lamda have to be complex :(
[06:24:26] <GetShwifty> lambda expressions ? or something else?
[06:24:41] <GetShwifty> if it's lambda expressions i betcha a) shitty language design + b) limitations of type erasures
[06:25:02] <GetShwifty> cauise afaik they never fixed it and would not surprise me if lambda expressions might suffer as a result
[06:25:21] <GetShwifty> but you should prolly elaborate on what is 'complicated' / non-intuitive
[06:25:22] <smallville7123_> this
[06:25:26] <smallville7123_>     default DoubleUnaryOperator compose(DoubleUnaryOperator before) {         Objects.requireNonNull(before);         return (double v) -> applyAsDouble(before.applyAsDouble(v));     }
[06:25:43] <smallville7123_> i have no idea where it gets `v` from
[06:25:46] <GetShwifty> did you do that ?
[06:25:54] <GetShwifty> or is that compiler/ AST  output >
[06:25:58] <smallville7123_> as it cannot be from the base class since that is an interface
[06:26:12] <smallville7123_> java/util/function/DoubleUnaryOperator.java
[06:26:22] <GetShwifty> oh iono
[06:26:36] <GetShwifty> see what's under the hood for C# unary operator, betcha its equally not pretty
[06:27:19] <GetShwifty> (double v) is just the expression
[06:27:26] <GetShwifty> the parameter of the double that you're going to pass to it
[06:27:46] <smallville7123_> where is it coming from?
[06:27:50] <GetShwifty> and i'm guessing it's written as (double v) because either a) java's type inferrence is sucking
[06:28:00] <GetShwifty> or b the return type is not such that it can be inferred
[06:28:03] <GetShwifty> in C# it would be
[06:28:14] <GetShwifty> return v => applyAsDouble(before.applyAsDouble(v);
[06:28:21] <GetShwifty> it's returning an expression
[06:28:32] <GetShwifty> well an expression or  delegate of sort
[06:28:50] <GetShwifty> which will be inserted/applied to whomever invokes that operator
[06:28:59] <smallville7123_> except "cannot convert lambda to expression because not delegate type"
[06:29:11] <smallville7123_> and delegates can only contain a single method
[06:29:38] <smallville7123_> where as DoubleUnaryOperator contains a single abstract method plus default composition methods
[06:30:47] <GetShwifty> yeah  typically opperators are expressed as classes
[06:30:56] <GetShwifty> it gives them the functionality and then they're visited
[06:31:16] <GetShwifty> i imagine that Java Expressions are very similar-ish in implementation details/behavior  as C#'s

[06:38:57] <GetShwifty> C# already has a UnaryOperator and friends along with a lambda implementation that i'd say arguably is better/more mature, etc
[06:43:00] <bkool> didn't Java try to implement something like lamda/linq in recent versions? but it's not great?
[06:44:38] <smallville7123_> google says it is ++ and --
[06:44:49] <smallville7123_> which is not the same
[06:49:48] <GetShwifty> UnaryOperator is an operation on a single operand that produces a result
[06:50:10] <GetShwifty> so it is the base for ALL of your operators
[06:50:29] <GetShwifty> (that are a single operand)
[06:50:35] <GetShwifty> like +,-, *, etc
[06:51:02] <smallville7123_> but it itself is not a class
[06:52:54] <smallville7123_> also is    `Enum.GetValues(typeof(Named)).Length`   and   `Enum.GetNames(typeof(Named)).Length`         the same in terms of returned length?

[06:53:40] * smallville7123_ wonders why Enum doesnt have a GetLength method
[06:54:02] <GetShwifty> because it would be a poor name for it
[06:54:09] <GetShwifty> it would imply Enum was an array / collection
[06:54:27] <smallville7123_> alright
[06:55:02] <smallville7123_> what about GetEnumCount ?

[06:55:25] <GetShwifty> not really
[06:55:36] <smallville7123_> ok
[06:55:37] <GetShwifty> and honestly getting the # of items is probably on the list of fringe scenarios
[06:56:11] <GetShwifty> so GetValues/GetNames and looking at the length more or less satisfies any need for the # of items

[07:21:41] <GetShwifty> so basically on one spectrum signed/unsigned byte and the opposite spectrum signed/unsigned 64-bit integer
[07:21:42] *** Quits: Kog (~Kog@about/csharp/kog) (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[07:22:43] <smallville7123_> would the types go from smallest to largest?
[07:22:56] <GetShwifty> the person implementing it specifies
[07:23:04] <GetShwifty> it defaults to Int32 if nothing is specified
[07:23:12] <GetShwifty> so you can do public enum MyEnum : sbyte
[07:24:03] <GetShwifty> your prolem really only comes if somebopdy who is using an UNSIGNED INT32 or SIGNED/UNSIGNED Int64 and you're assuming everything is an int32
[07:24:30] <smallville7123_> is there a way to automagically set the appropriate type as the method's return type without for example, name.Ordinal<Name.GetType().GetUnderlyingType()>(); assuming that is even valid
[07:24:33] <GetShwifty> well that any any potential issues that might arise from casing signed/unsigned  if any such exist
[07:25:00] <GetShwifty> if you really need to you can create and invoke a generic method via reflection
[07:25:12] <GetShwifty> i'd probably argue that you propbably shouldn't need that
[07:25:15] <smallville7123_> or should i just use BitConverter and convert/return everything as unsigned int64 ?
[07:25:48] <smallville7123_> (which would need to be cast to int if used as an index value anyway)
[07:26:05] <GetShwifty> i would not make a bet on unsigned
[07:26:15] <GetShwifty> because i quite often specify negative enum values
[07:26:33] <GetShwifty> set on int32 (default) or Int64 as your default
[07:27:05] <smallville7123_> should i return `object` instead and require the user explicitly cast to the correct type?
[07:27:32] <GetShwifty> not sure what you mean
[07:27:42] <GetShwifty> are they passing a MyCustomEnum.SomeValue and you're returning a ?
[07:27:55] <smallville7123_> like, have `name.Ordinal()` return object instead of int
[07:28:22] <GetShwifty> that would be quite the horribleness imho
[07:28:42] <smallville7123_> generic then?
[07:28:44] <GetShwifty> if you're writing an extension method you could probably write two extension methods, one to return Int32 and one to return Int64
[07:28:48] <GetShwifty> like Ordinal and OrdinalLong
[07:29:07] <GetShwifty> similar to how ms does Length
[07:30:33] <smallville7123_> like,     public enum MyEnum : sbyte { VAL };     ...       sbyte value_of(MyEnum x) { return x.Ordinal<sbyte>(); }
[07:31:26] <GetShwifty> could do that too, sure
[07:38:50] <smallville7123_> or rather `return (R)Convert.ChangeType(values.GetValue(i), typeof(R), CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);`
[07:39:01] <smallville7123_> since object may not be directly convertable
[07:39:22] <smallville7123_> (eg it may need to be first converted to its actual type and then to its target type)
[07:40:04] <smallville7123_> such as `(float)(int)obj` // (float)obj results in invalid cast

[08:15:27] <smallville7123_> does using a primative as a generic type result in boxing and unboxing of that type?
[08:16:36] <smallville7123_> or are they always "boxed" due to double being aliased to System.Double ?
[08:22:07] <smallville7123_> or does the compiler directly use the specified <T> as given and does not "box" to an equvilant object/class type? such as int -> Int32
[08:24:39] <smallville7123_> or does it only box if a value type is cast to a reference type?
[08:24:54] <GetShwifty> generics are generally smart  about that
[08:24:57] <smallville7123_> in which int and Int32 both are value types
[08:25:13] <GetShwifty> however, obviously if you perform an operation that performs a boxing then its goping to box/unbox
[08:25:24] <GetShwifty> (generics in C#)
[08:25:52] <GetShwifty> anything more detailed/specific requires looking at specific code , etc

[16:50:30] <Suchiman> JakeSays: yes
[16:50:54] <canton7> smallville7123_, it looks like the C# spec only guarantees that floating-point operations are performed with at least the precision of the end result. The compiler/JIT/runtime is free to choose a higher precision
[16:51:11] <JakeSays> Suchiman: that is very interesting. i wonder if it actually wrote the code or figured out that's what you wanted and found pre-written code somewhere

[17:05:56] <smallville7123_> can C# run on an IBM 360 ?
[17:06:10] <JakeSays> smallville7123_: ... that's irrelevant

[18:21:49] <GetShwifty> Outlook 2019 - did ms go backwards in search, used to be ableto get "real time as you type filtering in the inbox"
[18:22:35] <GetShwifty> now you have to hit enter to search and it seems to have fuckloads of problems finding anything , cant tell what that is related to. butthe lack of real time filtering...
[18:24:53] <Nasp> yes ms dont know how to do search and filtering anymore
[18:26:23] <GetShwifty> yeah it s not finding any results in one of my inboxes
[18:26:47] <GetShwifty> and a part of me thinks its because the inbox is a bit too big, mind you the inbox file is coming froma windows 7 system that had problems with psts >5gb ~
[18:27:00] <GetShwifty> so i typically keep them at 1-2gb~ and just split them amongst annual archives
[18:28:17] <JakeSays> so these roslyn code generator things - do they have to generate c# source, or can they be used to generate anything?
[18:29:20] <GetShwifty> from my limited reading i sort of gathered that it was a bit like a more specialized case of .tt files but instead of tt you use code to generate it
[18:29:34] <GetShwifty> so i would imagine that ignoring where it would try to get used, should be able to generate almost anything
[18:29:55] <GetShwifty> more just a matter of stuffing it wherever you want to use if not generating C# (or whatever langugage youre int)
[18:30:06] <JakeSays> right. hmm.
[18:32:35] <JakeSays> hmm. very handy indeed
[18:33:20] <JakeSays> "Currently only .NET Standard 2.0 assemblies can be used as Source Generators." wtf
[18:33:40] <GetShwifty> lol
[18:34:02] <GetShwifty> that's odd. isn't roslyn in .net core?
[18:36:09] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: yes
[18:36:24] <GetShwifty> hmm that limitation is a bit odd then
[18:36:49] <GetShwifty> i could see if it was in .net 4.x and they wanted to migrate to .net core in the future .. keeping that so that people would have more or less seamless migration
[18:36:56] <GetShwifty> (not that they actually cared about that in the past 5+ years) but
[18:37:20] <Suchiman> GetShwifty: roslyn is compatible with .NET Framework though
[18:37:27] <Suchiman> and runs in .NET Framework inside VS
[18:37:48] <GetShwifty> so then roslyn is written in .net standard?
[18:37:56] <GetShwifty> so it can run on .net fw or .net core?
[18:37:58] <Suchiman> multitargeting
[18:38:02] <Suchiman> or standard
[18:38:03] <GetShwifty> oh, okay
[18:38:03] <Suchiman> yeah
[18:38:15] <GetShwifty> well then i guess that makes sense as to whty the limitation for source  generator woudl be there
[18:38:52] <Nasp> I like the idea of source generators, but i dont like the idea of longer build times
[18:38:53] <GetShwifty> prolly a moot limitation for most things source code generator related
[18:39:08] <Nasp> I also feel like i need some sort of templating language to generate the code
[18:39:15] <GetShwifty> lol nasp
[18:39:22] <JakeSays> i can use source generators go generate dart proxies
[18:39:30] <GetShwifty> (8:59:21 AM) GetShwifty: from my limited reading i sort of gathered that it was a bit like a more specialized case of .tt files but instead of tt you use code to generate it :D
[18:39:38] <JakeSays> *to
[18:39:51] <GetShwifty> and yeah my eyes glaze over almost every time i see that cause like
[18:39:59] <GetShwifty> uggg its 2022 and that's the best we can come up with still
[18:40:18] <smallville7123_> an enum cannot be used in a union, right?
[18:40:54] <smallville7123_> specifically in an unmanaged struct
[18:40:57] <Nasp> I could really go for a decent pizza
[18:41:23] <GetShwifty> go to amsterdam, smoke some weed. then any pizza will be a decent pizza?
[18:41:42] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: does that same logic hold with women?

[19:59:15] <GetShwifty> i don't shop that much, but yeanb generally either a) sold by amazon or at least fulfilled by amazon
[19:59:22] <JakeSays> ^
[19:59:36] <GetShwifty> but sometimes you're in ahurry.. lol
[19:59:49] <JakeSays> ... although this order came in an amazon box.
[20:00:00] <GetShwifty> lmao
[20:00:00] <JakeSays> which is odd
[20:00:12] <GetShwifty> means they're 'recycling'
[20:00:18] <JakeSays> exactly!
[20:00:19] <JakeSays> wtf
[20:00:47] <JakeSays> and yet the return address is to an amazon facility
[20:00:57] <ern> I bought from Aliexpress, it was shipped by amazon (!)
[20:01:07] <ern> that was... wtf moment
[20:01:08] <JakeSays> ern: LOL really?
[20:01:10] <ern> yeah
[20:01:13] <JakeSays> wow
[20:01:23] <ern> I guess Amazon do logistics for 3rd parties too
[20:01:37] <JakeSays> well, amazon says they don't want to be in the freight business, but i never believed that
[20:01:49] <ern> so they had shipped their wares to amazon, and then used aliexpress to do the payment and then had amazon ship the goods
[20:02:02] <ern> It was really wtf
[20:02:13] <ern> (Sweden destination, Germany was the warehouse)
[20:02:20] <JakeSays> apparently they already ship more than ups
[20:02:31] <ern> I ordered near infrared heating panels for mother house.
[20:02:44] <ern> I can recommend those. 60x60cm , 360W, you put them in the cieling
[20:02:47] <GetShwifty> yeah JakeSays have a friend who works in fedex and he posted a stat once
[20:02:58] <GetShwifty> and yeah amazon was now top dog
[20:03:06] <ern> They have their own planes and everything
[20:03:48] <JakeSays> so if they have the infrastructure to ship their own shit everywhere, why wouldn't they go after ups/fedex? it's the aws model all over again
[20:04:02] <MatthiasVance> First they are figuring out drones
[20:04:06] <MatthiasVance> Then they go
[20:07:18] <GetShwifty> ultimately i dont think amazon wants to be fedex/ups
[20:07:29] <GetShwifty> because what amazon does is more or less organized chaos that they control
[20:07:38] <GetShwifty> what fedex/ups does is disorganized mayhaim that they don't control
[20:08:06] <GetShwifty> which is why they want to do fulfilment scenario as they can control/organize the chaos
[20:08:13] <JakeSays> well, they're a public company so they'll do whatever it takes to increase shareholder value
[20:08:19] <GetShwifty> but they don't want to go around to 1000 different places collecting pallettes/trucks, from people

[20:08:55] <JakeSays> it's a nice thing to have in case you need another business strategy
[20:09:13] <GetShwifty> they can always grow into it, but i don't really see them doing that imho

[20:31:37] <MichaelLong> yeah I even made a mistake, I left the "default" shipping method - which is supposed to be a bit faster. I was fine with the cost free shipping (6 weeks) as I was ordering something not very important obviously. But the registration, verification etc. was strange
[20:32:39] <MichaelLong> they've thrown coupons and first order price reductions at me so that I'm now some only paying for the "fast" shippment

[20:34:26] <GetShwifty> why is it
[20:34:43] <GetShwifty> whenever i read a thread on a ms forum where somebody asks "why can't i do something that i've been able to do for 10-30 years on a pc"
[20:34:50] <GetShwifty> and somebody says "you can't do it, its designed better. shyut up'
[20:35:04] <GetShwifty> and then somebody closes with a "ms designs an os with maximum feedbac and with maximum amount of choices
[20:35:04] <MichaelLong> the interface language is also a mixture of my local language they've detected and - italian.
[20:35:12] <GetShwifty> and it is literally the exact opposite of that
[20:35:39] <Diablo-D3> I dont think the windows team really knows how computers work anymore
[20:35:48] <GetShwifty> and that is a fact
[20:35:57] <GetShwifty> but the fucking excuses that everybody uses to defend them
[20:35:58] <Diablo-D3> they're a bunch of young kids who are afraid of keyboards and should see a specialist about possible lead exposure at a young age
[20:35:59] <MichaelLong> I've stopped reading at "on a ms forum".
[20:36:11] <Diablo-D3> how do I know this? I've met some of them
[20:36:27] <Diablo-D3> over discord, btw, but I still didn't enjoy the experience
[20:36:45] <JakeSays> Diablo-D3: that claim makes no sense - computers work exactly how the software they run was written to work, so ms knows how computers work when they run windows
[20:36:59] <GetShwifty> think what he was going for was
[20:37:09] <GetShwifty> "all of the idiots working at ms use air books and iphones"
[20:37:20] <GetShwifty> which is a pretty true statement last time i was on ms campus
[20:37:21] <JakeSays> what they may not know is how you want them to work :;p
[20:38:01] <JakeSays> last time i was on the ms campus was in '86 iirc
[20:38:13] <GetShwifty> last time i was on campus was when w8 was 'not yet released'
[20:38:29] <GetShwifty> and 1/2 of the ms employees there were saying "YOUll never want to use windows 7" "windows 8 will make you forget about windows 7"
[20:38:32] <GetShwifty> windows 8 will do 'everything'
[20:38:58] <GetShwifty> and what was funny is most of them had never actaully 'used it'
[20:38:58] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: isn't that the same claim they made about longhorn? lol
[20:39:03] <GetShwifty> nope
[20:39:08] <GetShwifty> i was on campus on ms
[20:39:12] <GetShwifty> for longhorn,
[20:39:24] <JakeSays> longhorn was the be all end all
[20:39:25] <GetShwifty> when you talked to that crew it was almost like longhorn didn't exist
[20:39:47] <GetShwifty> literally the only time anybody talked about a longhorn was at a session specifically for longhorn, outside of that
[20:39:49] <GetShwifty> it never existed
[20:39:53] <MichaelLong> are you MS groupies somehow? As often as you mention ms campus as if it was some temple.
[20:40:07] <JakeSays> well i dont know what they said internally, but they sure preached longhorn externally
[20:40:27] <GetShwifty> yeah, i pay more attention to waht they do / say internally JakeSays :D
[20:40:30] <JakeSays> until, of course, longhorn failed
[20:40:41] <GetShwifty> (basically after longhorn :D)
[20:41:00] <GetShwifty> MichaelLong:  filling various roles i've been on MS Campus a few times
[20:41:41] <JakeSays> well, what happens internally is pretty much irrelevant to me as all i have access to is the end result
[20:41:48] <GetShwifty> the last couple time i was on campus it was basically that photo of all of the ms dept heads pointing guns at each other
[20:41:55] <JakeSays> lol
[20:42:00] <JakeSays> that's a great cartoon
[20:42:10] <GetShwifty> yep and a very accurate description of what happened to ms
[20:42:30] <JakeSays> it was accurate for oracle and apple too
[20:42:50] <GetShwifty> oracle and apple had different topography cartoons in that one
[20:42:51] <GetShwifty> but yeah
[20:43:07] <JakeSays> well yeah that's what i'm saying
[20:43:11] <GetShwifty> just a crying shame that in 30 years
[20:43:15] <JakeSays> the cartoon was accurate
[20:43:26] <GetShwifty> that nobody else has created an os that stands a candle to the old windows/office
[20:43:46] <GetShwifty> and everybody else amusingly enough has started in one way or another jump off the w10 cliff lol
[20:44:03] <Nasp> JakeSays:  Isn't it typically the battery that dies in those dysons?
[20:44:13] <Nasp> I've seen people do mods so you can just use power tool batteries
[20:44:19] <GetShwifty> the dysons we're talking about are corded
[20:44:21] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: take a look at serenity os. lol.
[20:44:48] <JakeSays> Nasp: i don't know. the dyson stick i had always worked fine
[20:44:59] <GetShwifty> JakeSays:  is that another of the mm ReactOS clone?
[20:45:09] <GetShwifty> where they try to mimic windows 98 but have 0 refinement?
[20:45:40] <GetShwifty> honeslty somebody needs to create something where you can define the 'workflows'
[20:45:54] <GetShwifty> how do you want your 'start menu' to work, your systray, your taskbar / your 'docker', your alt tab
[20:45:59] <JakeSays> GetShwifty: it's not a clone. the guy just liked the classic windows look
[20:47:13] <GetShwifty> you have 'recipes' that are predefined things to choose from that are catered for various wrkflows/workloads
[20:47:29] <GetShwifty> e.g. the taskbar that a "3 app at a time" user vs the "30 apps / multiple instances" are very different
[20:47:57] <JakeSays> i just thought it was an interesting project.
[20:48:12] <JakeSays> apparently the guy started it to help deal with sobriety issues
[20:48:21] <GetShwifty> nice
[20:48:33] <GetShwifty> having an older brother who is an alcoholic and really needs that, i can sort of relate

[20:50:15] <GetShwifty> yeah, sadly somethign that is cool from a personal project to fight your personal demons pov
[20:50:28] <GetShwifty> but as 'can this scale to fill a void in the world'  :( not so much
[20:50:52] <JakeSays> well, ya never know. weirder things have happened.
[20:50:59] <GetShwifty> and overall aside from a few small things  he seems to have replicated a semi-modern take on windows 98 lol
[20:51:20] <GetShwifty> gopd the number of things i have to turn off on a new windows 10 installation
[20:51:28] <GetShwifty> should be a wizard
[20:52:01] <JakeSays> but ya gotta admit that for a one man effort project it looks really good
[20:52:09] <GetShwifty> "hey do you want to use cortana and have her nag" "hey do you want to be nagged by notifications every 10 minutes" "Hey do you want to hear about products that nobody ever takes but we like to spam people with" "Hey do you want those stupid folders like 3d objects that our metrics say nobody uses but we still insist on putting everybodys machine
[20:52:11] <GetShwifty> yeah
[20:52:16] <GetShwifty> i'd put it up there with Temple OS :D
[20:52:23] <JakeSays> LOL
[20:52:24] <GetShwifty> which is funny given Temple and Serenetity :D
[20:52:30] <GetShwifty> Serenity
[20:52:40] <JakeSays> i'm pretty sure it's much further along than temple
[20:52:44] <GetShwifty> yeah but
[20:52:48] <GetShwifty> temple was a complete kernel
[20:52:49] <JakeSays> well, the temple guy is dead

[20:52:58] <GetShwifty> it was a different level of architecture

[22:20:59] <Nasp> Ahh local use
[22:21:03] <Suchiman> Nasp: yeah
[22:21:09] <Nasp> Devs need local admin
[22:21:24] <Nasp> We can't run our shit without admin :D
[22:21:25] <JakeSays> Suchiman: oh you mean for their workstations?
[22:21:28] <Suchiman> JakeSays: yes

[22:21:33] <JakeSays> ahh. yeah that's dumb
[22:21:40] <Nasp> Makes sense for databases and such
[22:21:45] <Nasp> Also no shared accounts
[22:22:17] <Suchiman> JakeSays, Nasp: but hey, next to our DOMAIN/FirstName.LastName account that got admin rights revoked, we got another DOMAIN/adm-FirstName.LastName which does have admin permissions
[22:22:26] <JakeSays> so it appears that incremental source generators are completely undocumented

[22:35:35] <JakeSays> how does one create an accidental closure
[22:36:05] <Suchiman> JakeSays: well, same reason why in some languages you can declare local variables as const, it does not change codegen, just prevents you from accidentally reassigning vars
[22:36:53] <JakeSays> huh. so accidental closures is a common issue the?

[22:39:27] <Nasp> Lizard_:  Max am onth here
[22:39:31] <JakeSays> well i'm really disappointed in the lack of docs on generators
[22:39:35] <bomb> Lizard_ how long do you think it takes today?
[22:39:36] <Nasp> And i've often seen it flown in like less than a week
[22:39:47] <JakeSays> Suchiman: wut?
[22:39:47] <Nasp> I think custom takes the longest
[22:39:55] <Lizard_> bomb, 6 months, so they ship it by plane it less than a week instead
[22:40:15] <Suchiman> JakeSays: delegates use instance calling convention but static methods use static calling convention, they require a shuffle thunk to reorder the parameters
[22:40:20] <bomb> Lizard_ that's air shipping. not suitable for most of the goods
[22:40:33] <Suchiman> JakeSays: while instance to instance can just jmp right hrough
[22:40:51] <JakeSays> Suchiman: huh. that's odd
[22:41:16] <JakeSays> Suchiman: i dont understand why the shuffle would be required
[22:41:36] <Suchiman> JakeSays: well because for instance methods, this is the first parameter, but for static methods, param1 is the first parameter
[22:41:49] <Nasp> What would be the best way to determine if a .NET dll has changes?
[22:41:55] <Nasp> Afaik the builds aren't deterministic
[22:42:02] <Suchiman> JakeSays: so to call the static methods, all arguments must be left shifted by one
[22:42:03] <bomb> Lizard_ I'm still waiting for the elephant I ordered. thankfully their lifespan is around 50 years
[22:42:12] <Lizard_> Nasp, custom takes the longest when you ship phones, laptop or motherboard, gotta implants them...
[22:42:13] <JakeSays> Suchiman: but a captureless lambda wouldn't have a 'this' equiv.
[22:42:38] <Nasp> Lizard_: Atleast we got new custom rules in EU which made aliexpress and other sites add support for EU custom checkout
[22:42:40] <JakeSays> Suchiman: the code generator should know how to generate code for the static call
[22:42:46] <Nasp> It was pure hell before
[22:44:18] <Suchiman> JakeSays: yes but if you're calling SomeMethod(X x) through a delegate is delegate.Invoke(x); <--- where delegate is the `this` parameter followed by `X` and the runtime provided implementation of the `Invoke` method then needs to pop off the `this` parameter from the argument stack before it can call through to `SomeMethod`
[22:44:50] <JakeSays> Suchiman: ahh ok i see what you're saying
[22:47:31] <Lizard_> what are you using aliexpress for? parts? we have Digikey here that is very useful for that
[22:48:01] <Suchiman> JakeSays: yeah and that's why roslyn emits all lambdas as instance methods, IIRC they measured like a 30% speed up from that decision for something trivial like `x => x`
[22:48:24] <JakeSays> Suchiman: interesting
[22:48:48] <JakeSays> Suchiman: so in the case of a captureless lambda, 'this' is just ignored?
[22:48:57] <Suchiman> JakeSays: yeah
[22:49:06] <JakeSays> makes sense
[22:49:23] <JakeSays> Suchiman: now go become an expert on incremental generators for me:p
[22:50:54] <Suchiman> JakeSays: xD https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgxg9gTgpgtADwGwBYA+ABATARgLABQGAzAAQY5LlakDChA3oaS+WRVRiqQHIAUASmasmBVuNIBZPglIBeAHzkcAThkCBAbmEsAvjtIGSyzt2kUsAHgCWAOwAuS+zADO9oWJEHxzt3xRYWgb6BLpAA here you can see that roslyn uses a statically cached closure class with no state and the instance method on it
[22:52:58] <JakeSays> Suchiman: it's unfortunate that there's an allocation. seems like this should be dealt with in ryujit somehow
[22:53:42] <Suchiman> JakeSays: problem is that the callsite `test(42);` won't know what method it got passed
