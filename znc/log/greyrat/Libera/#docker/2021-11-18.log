[00:07:04] <trafficjam> is it possible that docker-compose files can conflict?
[00:10:14] <Tach> trafficjam which way ?
[00:11:16] <trafficjam> well i have two services, each in their own docker-compose files, and another traefik docker compose file. And when i `docker-compose up` service B, service A stops working (404)
[00:11:33] <trafficjam> however when i put down service B, service A starts working again
[00:11:48] <trafficjam> (when i say starts working, i mean that traefik is able to route requests to that service)
[00:12:03] <DoofusCanadensis> are you forcing container names?
[00:12:17] <trafficjam> er not too sure what that means
[00:12:28] <trafficjam> like do i have container_name defined?
[00:12:40] <DoofusCanadensis> something like that
[00:12:48] <dob1> running a docker-compose as systemd unit it's better to use simple as type or like in this example https://gist.github.com/mosquito/b23e1c1e5723a7fd9e6568e5cf91180f   oneshot and remain after exit ?
[00:13:04] <DoofusCanadensis> or traefik configuration that gives the two composes the same ingress path
[00:14:17] <trafficjam> DoofusCanadensis: no container_name, and regarding two composes, service A has an A record that points to 'foo.mydomain.com' @ <IP>, and service B has an A record that points to 'bar.mydomain.com' @ <IP>
[00:14:21] <Tach> trafficjam so swarm ?
[00:14:24] <trafficjam> that's all i can think of
[00:14:29] <trafficjam> no docker swarm
[00:14:40] <Tach> ok
[00:14:41] <trafficjam> 3 seperate docker-compose files
[00:16:22] <Tach> swarm uses the bridge right ?

[00:17:40] <trafficjam> can i define the same networks in multiple docker-compose files?
[00:21:05] <DoofusCanadensis> define? not really. use a precreated network? sure
[00:24:19] <trafficjam> yeah that's what i meant, the "networks:\n mynetwork:external" is just references networks, not creating them right?
[00:24:45] <trafficjam> man this is so strange, as soon i down service B, service A becomes reachable again
[00:24:48] <trafficjam> it makes no sesnse
[00:25:13] <DoofusCanadensis> how is traefik being configured for the containers?
[00:25:27] <DoofusCanadensis> there might be a duplication happening in that config
[00:26:29] <trafficjam> my traefik's docker-compose.yml file?
[00:28:13] <DoofusCanadensis> no configuration in your application compose files?
[00:28:57] <trafficjam> i can't think what it would be though
[00:29:46] <trafficjam> both service A and service B use these labels:
[00:30:14] <trafficjam> labels:
[00:30:15] <trafficjam>       - traefik.enable=true
[00:30:16] <trafficjam>       - traefik.http.routers.<foo|bar>.rule=Host(`[foo|bar].mydomain.com`)
[00:30:16] <trafficjam>       - traefik.http.routers.<foo|bar>.tls=true
[00:30:17] <trafficjam>       - traefik.http.routers.<foo|bar>.tls.certresolver=le
[00:30:17] <trafficjam>       - traefik.http.routers.<foo|bar>.entrypoints=websecure
[00:30:39] <trafficjam> and they reference some networks, but that's it
[00:30:43] <DoofusCanadensis> is that host identical in both files?
[00:30:53] <trafficjam> no the host is different per file
[00:31:08] <trafficjam> service A has host 'foo' and service B has host 'bar'

[01:04:31] <trafficjam> DoofusCanadensis, rawtaz: ok guys a miracle happened, i'm not sure if it was related but i changed the networks: proxy: internal: true to external: true, restarted the container and now it works
[01:04:49] <trafficjam> so weird, i honestly have no idea what's going on
[01:04:51] <DoofusCanadensis> okay a network issue then
[01:04:56] <rawtaz> no shit sherlock. it was never supposed to be internal:true. it's an external network, thats why this one was important
[01:05:04] <DoofusCanadensis> it was probably creating a network named internal
[01:05:21] <DoofusCanadensis> or proxy
[01:05:24] <rawtaz> the network is created by traefik and named "proxy", thats why you need to say that "this network is an external one that already exists and i should just use rather than create myself"
[01:05:35] <rawtaz> DoofusCanadensis: considering they had it specifically set to be internal, yeah

[01:05:59] <DoofusCanadensis> took them longer to notice that
[01:06:12] <DoofusCanadensis> I was only looking at the traefik rules, not the entire compose
[01:06:18] <rawtaz> trafficjam: i did mention it above. and i also have showed you that exact configuration part multiple times. it must have been a mistake that you just put internal instead of external there
[01:06:36] <rawtaz> i only started looking at your paste right when i wrote the above
[01:07:11] <trafficjam> that doesnt explain why it wasn't working when the search service was inside my app docker-compose file btw
[01:07:27] <rawtaz> the reason i said "no shit sherlock" is simply that it's obvious given how your other service is configured that this one too should have the same configuration for the proxy network. why would you make them different, when both of them are supposed to sit behind traefik the very same way?

[01:17:04] <redbrass> Looking for help using docker for cross compiling.  I have a rust based git repo, and a .gitlab-ci.yml file.  I have been asked to determine how to use docker to compile this for arm architectures.
[01:17:05] <trafficjam> correct, but originally it was a single file where the meilisearch service was moved from the bottom docker-compose.yml to the top, and it didn't work

[01:18:00] <rawtaz> (when it was in the same container)
[01:18:15] <rawtaz> but presumably it was just misconfigured. i dont see why it wouldnt work
[01:18:32] <redbrass> I'm trying to use the rust:latest image, with the arm64 digest.  and just opening a /bin/sh to start with.  That isn't working - it is giving me an image platform warning and a standard_init_linux.go:228: exec user process caused: exec format error
[01:18:33] <rawtaz> its just a container listening on the proxy network and alerting traefik via the labels
[01:18:51] <trafficjam> i don't see why either, but it didn't. If i recreate that originally docker-compose.yml file, i guarantee it will break my app again
[01:19:30] <redbrass> If I run the rust:latest without a digest (docker run -it rust:latest /bin/sh) I get a prompt just fine.

[01:20:00] <rawtaz> nothing worse than not knowing why shit doesnt work

[01:23:39] <trafficjam> it wasn't intentional, just have a lack of knowledge about a lot of this stuff and make (wrong) assumptions because of it

[01:37:13] <ikke> redbrass: note that qemu-user does not mean you run virtual machines in qemu
[01:37:55] <ikke> redbrass: it helps to see docker containers as a glorified chroot
[01:39:15] <redbrass> so cross compiling with docker is not feasible then?  A chroot would still rely on the host's kernel, which would be incorrect then.

[01:42:36] <trafficjam> rawtaz: oh yeah, what does the docker-socket-proxy thing do again? is that for getting websockets working?
[01:42:40] <redbrass> the "ls" command was just a quick/easy attempt at establishing first steps.

[01:47:37] <ikke> yes
[01:48:12] <ikke> otherwise, you still would need virtualization for those arches
[01:48:21] <Habbie> which can be easier

[01:49:22] <redbrass> makes the CI runners less convienient.  Means we need a shell runner instead of a docker runner.  The shell runner has some overhead/concerns we were hoping to avoid.

[03:55:51] <naicam|ne> i've set multiple ipv6 addresses on my host machine, and im trying to work out how to specify that each container uses a different one
[03:57:36] <naicam|ne> im not getting far with the stuff im finding online about it 
[03:57:39] <programmerq> naicam|ne▸ normally, you can publish ports to a specific host interface. The last time I tried to publish to a specific ipv6 address, the 'docker run' syntax didn't like it.
[03:58:03] <naicam|ne> well thats a good place for me to start thanks 
[03:58:32] <naicam|ne> any other info is welcome 
[03:58:38] <programmerq> so if you want containers to have their own routable ipv6 addresses, then you'd need to create a docker network with that ipv6 range, and set your docker host up to be a router for that range. You'll also need to have your broker set up a route to your dokcer host.
[03:59:36] *** Quits: calm-steam (~calm-stea@2a02:810a:980:1400::7fa9) (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
[04:00:15] <programmerq> for example, my isp gives me a /48. I could set up my router to grab a /64 inside that /48 and send it to a specific docker host. That docker host could then handle any traffic for that subnet, so you can do a 'docker network create ' with that range and the like.
[04:00:21] <naicam|ne> i guess what i was trying to do was slightly different 
[04:00:36] <programmerq> it's been a long time since I did the latter, but that's the way to properly get routed addresses assigned to containers.
[04:00:55] <naicam|ne> which isnt to say i should keep going down the path im on, but just saying 
[04:01:58] <naicam|ne> bc what i was attempting was to use the hosts interface, by running my containers in host mode 
[04:02:23] <programmerq> oh interesting, the port publish works with a v6 address now.
[04:02:24] <naicam|ne> and then assigning multiple ips to the nic 
[04:03:34] <programmerq> yeah, host mode networking pretty much disables all the docker networking isolation stuff, so your containerized processes simply see your host's interfaces like any non-containerized process would. You'd have to configure each one to bind to the correct address, and if one binds to ::0 then you're out of luck.
[04:03:49] <naicam|ne> oic
[04:04:04] <naicam|ne> im sure thats part of my issue 
[04:04:17] <programmerq> docker run -d --name nginxtest -p [2002::1234:abcd:ffff:c0a8:101:33]:80:80 nginx:alpine
[04:04:42] <naicam|ne> thanks 
[04:04:44] <programmerq> that container wouldn't have its own ipv6 address, but the port publish would only go to that on ip on the host. it's nice if you only need ipv6 ingress
[04:04:51] <naicam|ne> oic
[04:04:52] <programmerq> ipv6 egress you'd have to do more setup
[04:05:20] *** Quits: pycurious (~Adium@user/pycurious) (Quit: Leaving.)
[04:06:37] <programmerq> and if you want that container's traffic to appear as if its coming from that particular ip, then you would definitely want to directly assign those routable addresses to the containers and set up the routing stuff. Your host isn't readily able to distinguish how to route packets based on the container of origin, so your host's default routing table gets applied for egress.
[04:06:51] <programmerq> I *think* there's technically a way to do conditional routes, but it's messy at best.
[04:07:08] <programmerq> much messier than doing the proper range/subnetting/routing needed for direct assign
[04:07:39] <naicam|ne> ya i was trying to avoid having to learn about docker specific routing, since im only running three containers 
[04:07:41] <naicam|ne> hmm
[04:07:50] <programmerq> although if you do take that route, docker's default network drivers don't do any sort of firewalling if you end up assigning routable addresses to containers, so you'll want your subnet routing to be the firewall level.
[04:07:51] <naicam|ne> got a good resource on learning about that?
[04:08:17] <naicam|ne> i need to learn it at some point, may as well do it now :P 
[04:08:54] <programmerq> docker pretty much just spins up a bridge interface and attaches containers to that. It's functionally very very similar to a typical home router type setup, where your docker host is like the home router itself and the containers would be like your wifi devices.
[04:09:30] <naicam|ne> ya i can kinda see that 
[04:09:36] <programmerq> both the typical home router and docker will set up a NAT for egress. the "port publishing" that docker does is functionally equivalent to "port forwarding" in a typical router.
[04:09:40] <programmerq> and that's pretty much that.
[04:10:19] <programmerq> your router just sends all the packets where they need to go based on destination (as specified in the linux routing table)
[04:10:56] <naicam|ne> im also fairly new to ipv6 at this point 
[04:11:08] <programmerq> yeah, that's certainly a bit of its own beast.
[04:11:28] <naicam|ne> i figured out i was pretty dependent on ipv4 nat 
[04:11:59] <naicam|ne> alright

[05:11:58] <tabakhase> Flash volumes have a few extra features, mainly that they actually keep the data that was at the path - and while that comes with other problems (as this data wont ever get updated) sometimes its needed
[05:13:09] <tabakhase> on the other hand bindmounts have technically a performance-advantage - totally irrelevant for 99.9% of the cases, but worth nothing :P
[05:13:27] <Flash> so if my goal is just to exfiltrate data from the container, then a bind mount is the way to go?
[05:13:45] <tabakhase> plus its obvs. the only way for the "run this (code) from my disk in docker" (asside building)
[05:14:54] <tabakhase> for exfil you still have "docker cp" - and if a containers whole job is to produce a "thign" people may even go so far to let it spit to stdout ((ala "docke run generatetehint:latest > result.tar.gz"))

[17:48:11] <tabakhase> building containers is a whole nother sience, start by "using" ;-)
[17:48:25] <rawtaz> hehe good one tabakhase :)
[17:48:39] <rawtaz> although i thought the key part was "ubuntu" :P
[17:49:25] <tabakhase> Tach u been spamming for a while uh? why is that even a concern - you got a /8 a /12 and a /16 to pick from - i wouldnt bother with anything under /24 ever just cause "why would you..."
[17:49:45] <Tach> tabakhase because: networks
[17:50:13] <rawtaz> Tach: arent those internal networks anyway, that wont collide with whatever external ones youre using? or are you intending to expose containers by putting them directly on external networks?
[17:52:18] <tabakhase> rawtaz well the ubuntu part too i guess.... but so little of the stupid stuff of ubuntu is active in docker, it almost feels like debian so ill ok it :P

[17:55:57] <rawtaz> of course there's also the official nginx one at https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx - nginx itself can be slightly more of a hurdle to configure if youre not used to it though.
[17:56:08] <rawtaz> then there's apache ones and so on.
[17:56:24] <rawtaz> if you need one of them in particular of course you should go with that, but otherwise you could try Caddy

[18:48:39] <rawtaz> thats a really good question.
[18:48:52] <rawtaz> isnt the general take that most common things work, but that some containers arent built properly for arm64?

[18:48:58] <rawtaz> (and hence doesnt work at all or in part)
[18:49:11] <Habbie> rawtaz, non-arm64 containers use qemu
[18:49:18] <rawtaz> i *think* that docker is working on a native docker, but it's not near ready.
[18:50:21] <Mattiaslndstrm> I haven't worked with docker before, so I have no good input. This might provide some answers: https://dev.to/ericnograles/why-is-docker-on-macos-so-much-worse-than-linux-flh

[18:51:52] <rawtaz> its pretty old though, that one, and it's from before M1 so it isnt applicable to M1 aspects
[18:52:37] <rawtaz> its just about the old issue that docker cnat work with the darwin kernel the same way it does with the linux kernel, so it has to use a VM to run in and this has effects on performance, especially or in particular file I/O :/

[18:53:52] <Mattiaslndstrm> That's probably worse.
[18:54:06] <ada_> is docker the most important aspect of this purchase?
[18:54:19] <Mattiaslndstrm> It's an intel macbook I would get from my job.
[18:54:24] <Mattiaslndstrm> I honestly don't know.
[18:54:28] <Mattiaslndstrm> It's a new job.
[18:54:30] <ada_> the way I see it I'd rather have the workstation that feels comfortable, and there are lots of options for running docker that don't involve usint it on your mac
[18:54:40] <ada_> so I wouldn't put "docker fastness" at the top of my priority list
[18:54:47] *** Joins: incognito (~UserNick@user/incognito)
[18:54:59] <rawtaz> it truly boils down to how much you need to run docker, how you need to run it and what you intend to run with it
[18:55:02] <ada_> I use an intel mac rn and I still don't use docker on it itself
[18:55:08] <Mattiaslndstrm> That's a good point. I don't know exactly how much I would need to run docker.
[18:55:25] <Habbie> i used docker on an intel mac for years and while it was slow, yes, this often did not actually matter
[18:55:32] <ada_> I use it on remote servers, and if i _must_ run something locally then I have docker, but I don't really use it on my actual workstation
[18:55:51] <ada_> I like the OS X UX, but I prefer linux 
[18:56:24] <leonardo> tabakhase, rawtaz: i ended up using docker build --build-arg CACHE_BUSTING=$(shell /usr/bin/stat -f %m tasks/$*/submodules.deps || /bin/echo 0) ... 
[18:56:36] <leonardo> this way the cache will be invalidated only if that specific file is changed
[18:57:08] <rawtaz> nice
[18:57:43] <Mattiaslndstrm> Thank you everyone for your perspectives! I'll ask about how much I need to run docker.
[18:57:55] <rawtaz> the main problem as i see it is that using an intel laptop nowadays when there's thhe M1 family of chips in the macs is just.. like going back 20 years
[18:58:10] <kdbxw> My question is regarding named volumes. Is it supported by docker to have a single-file (not directory) named volume? E.g. I want "myvol1" to be mounted as /var/www/file.txt within a container. Therefore, /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol1/_data should be a file (not directory).
[18:58:14] <ada_> meh, until the very latest m1 pro, the m1 mac couldn't run more than 1 external display
[18:58:16] <rawtaz> its just hard to motivate. why would i get a machine taht the mac runs circles around
[18:58:18] <ada_> so that made my choice obvious
[18:58:26] <rawtaz> yeah but thats history
[18:58:41] <tabakhase> leonardo i wanne say yes but no... - yes thats does this and neat fix - but also kinda no looking at your dockerfile, the COPY will already bust.... ((and im als not sure what you do with copy but then also build-time-binds...))
[18:59:40] <tabakhase> kdbxw pretty sure thats a no
[18:59:55] <ada_> kdbxw: no
[19:00:09] <kdbxw> tabakhase, ada_ ok, thanks
[19:00:30] <rawtaz> kdbxw: just bind-mount a single file instead
[19:00:49] <leonardo> tabakhase: normally i'd agree with you but i don't know why without that fix the cache won't be invalidated
[19:00:49] <rawtaz> or mount a regular volume and softlink the file into it
[19:00:55] <leonardo> which is weird enough i know

[22:54:54] <ghostboarder> hey all, i am using deluge on unraid docker. I upgraded my cache drive and reinstalled all my dockers, but i am having the webUI issue with deluge (which some may be familiar with). No errors in console log, webui and deluge client on phone cant connect

[23:06:16] <notevil> ghostboarder: check the published port.  does `docker ps` show the port there?
[23:08:09] <ghostboarder> First thing i checked :) yes it does. All settings from the previous install were retrieved, so webui and client port etc are all as they were

[23:09:24] <notevil> did the host ip change?  can you reach 8112 from the host?
[23:10:26] <ghostboarder> no. All other features and dockers work fine. I can bring up a console for the deluge docker from the unraid gui and navigate the docker tree
[23:11:40] <ghostboarder> this used to be a common problem with this version of deluge. I went back a bunch of releases as apparently it was related to python and that would fix it. Hard to tell what the issue is now, as i CAN use another deluge version from the unraid app store and it works just fine
