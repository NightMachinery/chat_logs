[12:04:54] <hi^-^> and is there a zero-based array library? like you can initiate it like z(0,1,2,3,4,5,6) and the table is returned zero-indexed, and all the standard functions for which the 1-index matters are provided with an alternative.
[12:06:14] <andreyorst> are there specific reasons you have to use zero indexed tables?
[12:06:28] <andreyorst> Tables are not arrays, i.e. are not mapped directly to memory, there's no need for it to be zero-based, because index is not a memory offset
[12:07:36] <hi^-^> andreyorst, i know they aren't arrays i know, i meant, figuratively. 
[12:08:36] <hi^-^> andreyorst: consistency with C apis and avoiding the big pain off-by-one-errors already are.
[12:08:52] <andreyorst> yeah, I just asked, maybe because you're going to interface with C bindings which use arrays internally, which are zero based, so maybe you want to make tables zero based to avoid a mishmash of here's a table use 1 here's array use 0
[12:09:31] <rjek> You can put a value at 0 in a table
[12:10:32] <hi^-^> rjek: you can, but some standard functions (the one which got the length for example) assume it starts from zero, and that is why i ask if there is a library
[12:11:01] <rjek> I think you're doing this wrong
[12:11:01] <andreyorst> rjek: though it will not go to the sequential part, it will be in the associative one
[12:11:02] <hi^-^> thats the biggest problem with lua. otherwise it is generally fine.
[12:11:26] <rjek> It really isn't a problem, I've been using it for 20 years and it's never actually been a problem apart from people going "eww not starting from 0"
[12:12:23] <rjek> If you want JavaScript, DukTape is very Lua-like in its API and approach
[12:12:56] <hi^-^> keeping out those web-heathens is enough of a reason not to use javascript

[12:50:04] <hi^-^> what about these two questions:
[12:51:15] <hi^-^> is there some fast way to make lua bindings to C stuff? (I know of the luajit thing and that is cool, but i want to be able to use standard lua as well)
[12:51:39] <hi^-^> if i want to make some lua runtime, that by default has some libraries embedded ( i mean other libraries other people already wrote and I only embed them) and is restricted to them, how do i do it best 
[12:51:40] <Humbedooh> write it in a file and compile it?
[12:51:43] <Humbedooh> :)
[12:51:45] <rjek> I find the Lua API simple enough to quickly bind C stuff

[20:26:35] <phryk> Does lua have a built-in to dump object contents into a string? something like PHPs var_dump or at least like pythons dir() so I can manually collect and output them?
[20:27:19] <q66> no
[20:27:59] <phryk> any other method to inspect state of a running program for debugging purposes?
[20:28:52] <q66> inspecting the state of a program is a pretty vague thing
[20:29:04] <rjek> debug.debug()
[20:29:34] <q66> debug.debug() gets you a mode in which you can actually inspect things, but for serializing values you'll need your own thing
[20:31:12] <rjek> hello q66 btw, how are you?
[20:31:21] <q66> however to inspect the program you don't always need to dump entire tables
[20:31:40] <q66> rjek: same as always
[20:31:53] <q66> how's stuff over there
[20:32:10] <rjek> wet
[20:32:16] <phryk> I'm not sure I understand from the documentation what debug.debug does – does it pull up a REPL whereever called?
[20:32:19] <q66> that's just england
[20:32:25] <q66> yeah sort of
[20:32:49] <q66> at the line you run it, it will get you a prompt where you can check things at the specific state, and then you can exit it to continue
[20:33:16] <phryk> that sounds like what I'm looking for. :)
[20:34:58] *** Quits: vnogueira (~vnogueira@user/vnogueira) (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:35:02] <q66> just keep in mind the prompt is not bound to locals, so to inspect local variables you will need to use the debug interface again

[20:42:46] <MattJ> phryk, unfairly injecting context, you want to use Prosody's telnet console for this
[20:43:00] <MattJ> debug.debug() will block everything, and it's somewhat annoying and limited in comparison
[20:43:07] <phryk> Heh okay MattJ :D
[20:43:44] <MattJ> If you prefix your command line with '>' it will evaluate any Lua expression, and (in recent versions) pretty-print the result for you
[20:45:25] <phryk> :*
[20:53:35] <phryk> Oh but MattJ, reading about this it doesn't seem like I'll be able to inspect the state inside a particular function with this – or am I misinterpreting?
[20:54:33] <MattJ> You can inspect upvalues, but not locals (because locals only exist while a function is executing, and you would have to halt execution to see them)
[20:54:44] <RhodiumToad> see debug.getlocal
[20:55:09] <phryk> RhodiumToad: oh you're here, too? :D smol worl.
[20:55:10] <MattJ> To access upvalues, just index the function like it's a table (that's a Prosody-specific thing), so myfunc.foo will return the upvalue 'foo'
[20:57:04] <phryk> Yeah, I'm not even close to familiar enough with lua to know what that means. I think I'll stick to debug.debug for now. :)
[20:58:00] <MattJ> Then you'll need prosody -F and a lot of patience :)
[20:59:57] <phryk> fine with me, for now. just need to orientate myself :)

[21:59:00] <phryk> I can't print local variables – why?
[21:59:05] <phryk> (from debug.debug)
[21:59:19] <phryk> even true when i define the local within the debug shell…
[22:08:55] <phryk> doesn't work in a normal lua repl either and i have no idea why this isn't something where i immediately get 23 bajillion hits on ddg or google… o_O
[22:11:36] <phryk> i have a stupid suspicion i'M going to check after going shopping: every line in the repl introduces a new scope. no idea how that would make any sense, but it's the only way i can see this behavior being congruent with what luas docs tell me…

[22:43:10] <phryk> yup, printing locals works fine and dandy from a dedicated script.
[22:53:39] <phryk> what for the love of goddess was the reasoning to make every REPL line introduce a new parallel scope?
