[07:34:16] <yuken> SpookyGibby, not carbed enough yet :(
[07:34:35] <SpookyGibby> it takes 2-4 weeks to carb dude
[07:34:37] <yuken> Doesn't taste vomit-inducing though.
[07:34:41] <yuken> Bullshit!
[07:34:51] <SpookyGibby> did you use priming sugar? 
[07:34:54] <yuken> no.
[07:34:56] <SpookyGibby> ...
[07:35:01] <a1> are you using black tacticool bottles
[07:35:12] <SpookyGibby> jesus fucking christ dude 
[07:35:15] <yuken> SpookyGibby, bruh.
[07:35:17] <SpookyGibby> not trying to be mean 
[07:35:31] <SpookyGibby> but did you even read how to do this? 
[07:35:33] <yuken> Nope.
[07:35:40] <cryptic1> clearly not
[07:35:40] <SpookyGibby> welp thats clear now
[07:35:41] <yuken> I shoved shit in a jug and hoped it worked.
[07:35:44] <Cl0udNinja> oh wow
[07:35:59] <yuken> SpookyGibby, well, it has been cold (40-50F), so the yeast are probably still alive...
[07:35:59] <a1> well if it's literal shit, it's clearly not going to work
[07:36:03] <yuken> I could dump some sugar in there now.
[07:36:34] <SpookyGibby> so, before you bottle it, you need to add priming sugar to give the yeast energy to eat so they produce CO2 to carb it
[07:36:39] <yuken> I'm aware of that.
[07:36:40] <SpookyGibby> if its in bottles now, its too late
[07:36:50] <yuken> I assumed there was enough already ;(
[07:36:58] <SpookyGibby> no
[07:37:04] <SpookyGibby> thats not how it works
[07:37:17] <cryptic1> so did you add priming surgar?
[07:37:20] <yuken> nope.

[07:37:54] <SpookyGibby> I'd put whatever you have in 60-70 degree weather, out of light, and wait 2-3 weeks
[07:37:57] <cryptic1> wrong answer
[07:37:59] <cryptic1> so did you add priming surgar?
[07:38:00] <SpookyGibby> hopefully it isn't shit
[07:38:00] <JollyRgrs> yuken: did you use priming surgar?
[07:38:03] <yuken> no.
[07:38:07] <cryptic1> wrong answer
[07:38:09] <cryptic1> so did you add priming surgar?
[07:38:11] <a1> why did you not use priming surgar
[07:38:18] <yuken> SpookyGibby, I have nowhere to keep them in 60-70 degrees where, if they did explode, I'd want to deal with the mess.
[07:38:20] <yuken> Basement is 40-50.
[07:38:25] <JollyRgrs> didn't the instructions you are following tell you to do that?
[07:38:29] <yuken> >instructions
[07:38:30] <a1> don't you get cold down there
[07:38:42] <SpookyGibby> 40-50 isn't warm enough for the yeast to really work 
[07:38:50] <xe0n> inb4 yuken gets his stomach pumped
[07:39:07] <a1> i've never heard of a semen overdose xe0n but maybe it's a first
[07:39:13] <SpookyGibby> I mean, it will, but then you'll need 2-4x the time to "carb" in your case
[07:39:26] <yuken> sounds good to me.
[07:39:43] <yuken> There has to be enough leftover sugars to do _something_ smh. It was still bubbling when I poured it out.
[07:39:51] <SpookyGibby> you're essentially cold crashing yeast for a cider which is fucking... retarded. 
[07:39:56] <yuken> lol
[07:40:06] <yuken> I mean, I can restart entirely SpookyGibby.
[07:40:12] <xe0n> rtfm
[07:40:19] <yuken> I got my hydrometer _AND_ wine yeasts in.
[07:40:28] <SpookyGibby> wine yeasts?!
[07:40:34] <yuken> well, cider yeast.
[07:41:02] <yuken> SpookyGibby, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N2WGUPW/
[07:41:04] <SpookyGibby> hope it doesn't get infected
[07:41:07] <JollyRgrs> MAGNETS! HOW DO THEY WORK!?!?!?
[07:41:14] <SpookyGibby> and I hope you leave it long enough to semi-carb
[07:41:17] <xe0n> its science
[07:41:29] <SpookyGibby> but, you'll want to keep them 4-6 weeks in the dark so they can figure shit out
[07:41:43] <SpookyGibby> at least
[07:41:55] <yuken> I'll let my current batch carb for a bit, SpookyGibby - and order some proper bottles, then start a new batch with this cider yeast.
[07:41:58] <yuken> and prime it before bottling.
[07:42:35] <yuken> If I'm going to basically let it eat all the sugars to be very dry, but I want sweetness, I should just add a non-fermentable sweetener, right?
[07:43:43] <JollyRgrs> you're asking the channel for ad-lib advice on instructions, but you literally couldn't add priming sugar from the instructions you were already following?
[07:44:02] <yuken> I wasn't following instructions, JollyRgrs.
[07:44:08] <xe0n> duh
[07:44:10] <JollyRgrs> what were you following?
[07:44:13] <yuken> Instinct.
[07:44:19] <xe0n> smh..
[07:44:21] <JollyRgrs> folk tales passed down orally from your grandfather to you?
[07:44:34] <JollyRgrs> son, at your age, you don't have the instinct
[07:44:35] <yuken> nah JollyRgrs that'd probably get good results.
[07:44:45] <JollyRgrs> at any age, you won't
[07:45:02] <JollyRgrs> making cidar isn't really... an instinctive thing
[07:45:35] <SpookyGibby> yuken: i promise its not hard my dude. Brew the thing, get it to the proper temps when needed, add the things when needed. Let batch cool. Then add the sugar for fermentation, drop that into the carboy, let ferment for 5-9 days depdning on how much the blubs go. Once its starting to subside on the amount of bubbles, its time to bottle. You transfer the cider FROM the carboy to a bottling container with the added primer sugar 
[07:45:35] <SpookyGibby> where you can rack the bottles after cleaning them with a no-rinse sanitizer-- usually you keep the bottles in that solution until you rack them. After you bottle, cap, set in cases for 2-4 weeks until properly carb'd.

[07:46:12] <yuken> SpookyGibby, yes. 
[07:46:28] <yuken> I added a bunch of sugar when I started fermenting, and bottled it when it was still blubbling but less than when it started.
[07:46:49] <yuken> 3/4 cup for roughly 0.85 gallons.
[07:47:11] <SpookyGibby> right, but there are two methods of card'ing, either in glass bottles or in a keg
[07:47:26] <SpookyGibby> and depending on the type of booze, the sugar will vary

[10:03:14] <Cl0udNinja> yeah. am lefty. when I played hockey my sticks cost twice as much, they dont make lefty paintball markers (actually all guns are righty dominant :bigsad:) and the minor shit like scissors and notebooks usually cost a bit more too
[10:03:58] <JollyRgrs> notebooks w/ the spiral on the right?
[10:04:12] <JollyRgrs> you should just lurn2gitgud and be a righty
[10:05:11] <Cl0udNinja> they actually tried to force me to be righthanded in school. I cant write right handed because of a bone spur in my thumb
[10:05:50] <Alternity> back in the day they'd just beat the devil out of you until you were a righty
[10:05:50] <Cl0udNinja> I was in literal pain for 3 months because they forced me to write right handed before my mom raised enough stink to get them to stop doing it. if I tried using my left the teacher would yell at me

[10:07:09] <EvilNinja> lol
[10:07:16] <JollyRgrs> Alternity: happened to my wife, her grandma is a lefty and her pre-school tried to beat the lefty outta my wife (it worked)
[10:07:28] <EvilNinja> righties learn with other righties, so all of their blocks and attacks are right-hand based. as a lefty I learned with a righty teacher, so I learned to swing as a lefty and block right hand attacks
[10:07:54] <JollyRgrs> interesting
[10:07:58] <JollyRgrs> you just learned like... fencing stuffs?
[10:08:06] <EvilNinja> yeah we used to practice with kendo sticks
[10:08:26] <EvilNinja> the worst damage done was a broken thumb (to my friend) and a cracked rib (to me)
[10:09:07] <EvilNinja> the rib one was a good one... it was the first time my friend managed to get a shot on me, and I totally lunged full force into the end of the kendo
[10:10:51] <EvilNinja> actually, speaking of swords.. funny story.. my friend was a big sword nerd, had lots of them, assortment of knives and daggers too. some people threatened one of our friends and then tried to roll up to our house to fight us. we charged out at them with swords

[23:33:27] <EvilNinja> ah we gif it up at work
[23:33:32] <bloody> you can turn it off on discord but we dont talk about that here :)
[23:33:49] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> yay bbd
[23:33:49] <EvilNinja> we respond in gif form about 20% of the time
[23:33:50] <bloody> need a modified client which is technically against ToS
[23:34:10] <bloody> EvilNinja: i have turned off gif embedding cause my work does that shit too
[23:34:16] <bloody> it just says "User sent a GIF"
[23:34:23] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> only time discord really cares is when you start doing selfbot stuff
[23:34:27] <EvilNinja> lol you're no fun
[23:34:41] <EvilNinja> every time someone asks me to do something I respond with a meeseeks gif
[23:34:41] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> but they've proven they have no clue how to really defend against that so it's w/e
[23:34:42] <bloody> hurdygurdy yeah, but it's still technically against ToS
[23:34:55] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> who even read ToS LUL
[23:35:06] <EvilNinja> at least 1 lawyer
[23:35:10] <EvilNinja> maybe 1 ceo

[23:36:05] <bloody> gifs? annoying imo

[23:37:05] <bloody> ah man
[23:37:23] <bloody> no better feeling than putting on fresh clothes after a quick workout and shower
[23:37:29] <EvilNinja> bloody, tbh I disliked it where I've previously worked, but believe it or not, I actually like where I work and the people I work with, so gif responses are pretty acceptable to me. I like gettin a good laugh at work
[23:37:33] <sd> 03<H​urdyGurdyBurdy> tfw you have 24bit spooky scary skeletons

[23:41:51] <EvilNinja> goddamn, I had a butthole puckering moment in a game yesterday, managed to push the main part of my desk back a good 2-3 inches
[23:42:07] <EvilNinja> only just now realized I did so because my monitor was angled all wonky
[23:47:51] <Thedarkb-Desktop> So I've said fuck it to the cloud and I'm just going to put it on the cluster like I should've in the first place.
[23:53:32] <sd> 06<s​tig124> I might be all wrong, but the Discord mod opening got canceled or smth?
[23:54:09] <sd> 06<s​tig124> I've applied like 4 month back, and no further announcement was made
