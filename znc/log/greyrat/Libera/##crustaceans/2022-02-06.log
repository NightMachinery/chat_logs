[00:00:10] <manicennui> There was a forest behind my house growing up. It is more houses now.
[00:00:21] <manicennui> It wasn't super old growth, but it was substantial.
[00:00:24] <imode> I can't stand that. the sound of chainsaws make me want to murder people.
[00:00:29] <manicennui> We spent a lot of time fucking around in it.
[00:01:04] <imode> in fact I almost did. they cut down a 100 year old tree at one point, and I was about to go out and threaten the loggers at gunpoint until my family stopped me.
[00:01:22] <imode> thankful they did, but I can't live around destruction.
[00:01:28] <imode> it'll end in homicide.
[00:01:45] <manicennui> That's one of my goals with buying some land or a house with land.
[00:01:49] <manicennui> Keep most of it wild.
[00:01:53] <imode> same.
[00:02:02] <imode> I don't think it's worth buying anything out west.
[00:02:14] <imode> the industrial/suburban creep is growing and growing.
[00:02:29] <imode> to the point where nearly all nature will be gone within 20-30 years unless you head to the fucking canadian border.
[00:02:32] <manicennui> The author Jeff VanderMeer (Annihilation) has a place in FL where he has "rewilded" his yard.
[00:02:39] <manicennui> He posts amazing videos of the wildlife.
[00:03:11] <imode> damn.
[00:03:49] <imode> that is a pretty property. guy's a millionaire though.

[00:05:02] <manicennui> imode: You don't have to be.
[00:05:13] <manicennui> There is a lot of affordable land in the US, especially if you don't want to build on it.
[00:05:38] <imode> if only I posessed the finances to buy it and just sit on it in addition to the rent(s) I pay.
[00:05:47] <manicennui> You could easily find a couple acres in many areas that you could build on for less than $50k.
[00:06:14] <imode> maine is pretty popular for that. a majority of our wild land is privately owned and conserved.
[00:06:44] <manicennui> A lot of NE does things that keeps a lot of land wild.
[00:06:50] <manicennui> I really wish winters weren't so harsh.
[00:07:18] <imode> same. but I feel like I'm willing to forego convenience for peace of mind.
[00:07:34] <manicennui> https://vnrc.org/community-planning-toolbox/tools/large-lot-zoning/
[00:07:35] <buttsbot> Large Lot Zoning – Vermont Natural Resources Council
[00:07:55] <imode> once my parents are dead I'll probably wander.
[00:08:24] <manicennui> I really want everything about Vermont, but warmer.
[00:09:24] <manicennui> I wish I could write well. Maybe I could if I practiced and put in the effort.
[00:09:31] <manicennui> I have a lot of random ideas.
[00:09:41] <imode> https://www.cfact.org/2021/11/16/maine-voters-reject-renewable-energy-power-line-through-north-woods/
[00:09:42] <buttsbot> Maine voters reject "renewable-energy" power line through North Woods - CFACT
[00:09:45] <imode> good.
[00:10:07] <manicennui> Yeah, I think NE is one of the few areas where real conservation is happening consistently.
[00:10:23] <manicennui> They don't seem to care about protecting some industry or corporate profits or whatever.
[00:10:33] <manicennui> I'm sure there are exceptions. Probably logging or something.
[00:10:53] <imode> maine is nearly 100% logged, most old growth was torn up when logging was, well, popular.
[00:10:56] <manicennui> But they value the natural areas themselves.
[00:10:57] <imode> but the forest cover has been replenished.
[00:11:06] <imode> there are actual healthy ecosystems there.
[00:11:10] <manicennui> I feel like in places like California it is more about having beautiful places for rich people to vacation.
[00:11:23] <imode> the west is a cursed place.
[00:11:33] <imode> built on the grounds of "get rich or die".
[00:11:42] <imode> it's where people of greed congregate.
[00:11:55] <imode> I was foolish to move here but I didn't exactly have a choice.
[00:12:15] <manicennui> I also feel like North Carolina has managed to conserve a lot of land for reasons that aren't clear.
[00:12:17] <imode> I wouldn't buy land here. there's too many malicious actors with a _lot_ of money to throw around.
[00:12:25] <manicennui> There is great hiking everywhere, and it is never crowded.
[00:12:59] <manicennui> It's probably the winter in NE that prevents everyone from moving there and wrecking it.
[00:13:11] <manicennui> Which also makes it more tempting to me.
[00:13:11] <imode> imo it's really not that bad.
[00:13:28] <manicennui> Have you seen the way people in California talk about even rain?
[00:13:34] <imode> having been there through the worst of it (ice storm of 2013), we survived.
[00:13:36] <imode> yeah.
[00:13:40] <imode> that's why I want out.
[00:13:42] <imode> back home.
[00:13:44] <manicennui> I always thought Portland was just non-stop rain all year.
[00:13:53] <manicennui> Then I learned that it is just during the winter when it is snowing here.
[00:13:53] <imode> seattlites talk about it the same way.
[00:14:01] <imode> complain about it, even.
[00:14:05] <manicennui> Their summers are very dry.
[00:14:09] <imode> I swear to god the majority of people that live here are psychopaths.
[00:14:30] <imode> washington is great. it produces the highest number of serial killers per capita.
[00:14:38] <imode> I wonder why. the entire west is a hostile fuckhole.
[00:15:00] <manicennui> heh
[00:15:37] <manicennui> CA, OR, and WA are also what, 25% of the US population?
[00:15:37] <imode> my mother tried to pitch the argument that ME gets most of the pollution from MA and NY.
[00:16:23] <manicennui> I was way off.
[00:16:31] <manicennui> OR and WA are surprisingly small.
[00:16:32] <imode> like, okay. we get most of the pollution from seattle.
[00:16:35] <manicennui> Maybe 15% total.
[00:17:35] <imode> oh my god.

[00:18:47] <manicennui> Princes?
[00:18:56] <imode> the description says 32 acres.
[00:19:07] <manicennui> Ah.
[00:19:28] <manicennui> Wait. Where the fuck is this?
[00:19:53] <imode> Nova Scotia.
[00:20:01] <manicennui> Ah.
[00:21:11] <imode> 1,393,920 Acres would be roughly a third of vermont.
[00:21:27] <imode> for $34,900 CAD? fuck yeah

[00:22:15] <manicennui> 10.2 acres for $50k.
[00:22:33] <imode> was just looking at that.
[00:22:38] <manicennui> Northeast Kingdom in Vermont has a lot of affordable land.
[00:22:45] <manicennui> And I imagine much of New Hampshire.
[00:22:53] <imode> yeah. thankful for that.
[00:24:01] <imode> I wonder if Amazon would still keep me on if I moved back to Maine. or NE.
[00:24:25] <manicennui> Have they not given in to the whole remote thing?
[00:24:27] <imode> apparently they're hiring SDEs for all remote positions.
[00:24:38] <imode> I mean fuck if they confirm that outwardly I'm moving back tomorrow.

[00:25:28] <buttsbot> 0 Arsley Rd, Barre, VT 05641 | MLS #4892039 | Zillow
[00:25:28] <imode> I could live like a king for 4 years and save up enough to buy land while paying my parents' rent for the next 50.
[00:25:39] <manicennui> 287 acres for $280k
[00:25:44] <manicennui> Heavily forested
[00:25:48] <imode> that looks like some beautiful country.
[00:26:04] <manicennui> I've been saving. My entire plan is to do something like this.
[00:26:08] <manicennui> Probably not that much land though.
[00:26:13] <imode> "This land cannot be developed, and no camp can be built on it."
[00:26:34] <imode> good.
[00:27:16] <imode> god it'd actually be fucking awesome to relocate to the east coast. if only for the time zone difference.

[00:27:29] <manicennui> That one implies it can be built on.
[00:27:41] <manicennui> 225 acres for $225k.
[00:27:53] <imode> that's the same link.

[00:28:13] <imode> np.
[00:28:34] <imode> oo.
[00:28:38] <imode> that is nice.
[00:28:39] <manicennui> It's hard for me to understand how someone can look at something like this and think, "I'd rather live in the suburbs."
[00:29:01] <imode> welcome to why I'm eternally pissed at my parents.
[00:29:15] <imode> they traded a view of a bay surrounded by nothing but forests for a cramped suburb.
[00:29:20] <manicennui> I feel like I've been trying to convince myself that I enjoy being in the city for years.
[00:29:23] <imode> to be next to my fucking moron of a sister.
[00:29:50] <manicennui> But once I stopped doing things that I didn't really enjoy, like going to loud bars and crowded cafes, I realized that there isn't a lot of reason for me to be here.
[00:30:10] <manicennui> I can't claim to understand parents.
[00:30:11] <imode> it's worse if you come to the city from all of that.
[00:30:18] <manicennui> My father has done some dumb shit for my fuckup brother.
[00:30:20] <imode> like, I used to have wild turkeys roaming in my front yard.
[00:30:32] <imode> porcupines that'd nest and settle on our deck.
[00:30:38] <manicennui> I came from the suburbs to the city, so that was definitely an upgrade.
[00:30:39] <imode> I've held a hummingbird three times.
[00:31:04] <imode> all manner of ducks and geese, I used to catch grasshoppers at our old home. I used to actually see fireflies.
[00:31:41] <imode> the light pollution was so low at night, and the moon so bright, it felt like you were exploring another plane of existence.
[00:31:54] <imode> everything was so quiet.
[00:32:04] <manicennui> I stayed at a place in the fall that had no light pollution. It was eerily dark at night.
[00:32:28] <manicennui> I was actually a little concerned that I might bump into a bear.
[00:32:34] <imode> you very well could've.
[00:32:52] <manicennui> They actually had shared bear-proof dumpsters in that neighborhood.
[00:32:56] <manicennui> So they were a real concern.
[00:33:05] <imode> give me the coastline and forest any day. there's nothing appealing about highly populated areas. humans are not desirable to be around.
[00:37:06] <manicennui> Another group of people I hate: flippers.
[00:37:30] <manicennui> I come across so many listings where they bought the house a year ago, did some minor remodeling, then list it for a couple hundred thousand more than they paid.
[00:37:53] <imode> my relatives are flippers.
[00:38:04] <manicennui> Like this place: https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/55-Wendover-Rd-Asheville-NC-28806/5604084_zpid/
[00:38:06] <buttsbot> 55 Wendover Rd, Asheville, NC 28806 | MLS #3824942 | Zillow
[00:38:07] <imode> they live in a barren wasteland in michigan.
[00:38:12] <manicennui> Kind of has the things I want, at least for now.
[00:38:21] <manicennui> Just over a quarter acre of land.
[00:38:28] <imode> that is. fucking overpriced.
[00:38:33] <imode> jesus.
[00:38:33] <manicennui> They bought it for $307k a year ago.
[00:38:40] <manicennui> It probably isn't very overpriced though.
[00:38:43] <manicennui> Asheville is just expensive.
[00:38:51] <imode> for that thing? fuck that.
[00:39:27] <manicennui> Plus the size of the lot makes it more expensive.
[00:39:53] <manicennui> But fuck them for buying a house just to make it more expensive.
[00:40:09] <manicennui> +87.3%
[00:40:11] <imode> that is not a lot of acreage for a lot of money, along with not a lot of house for a lot of money.
[00:40:19] <imode> that's more than likely over the conforming loan limit for NC.
[00:40:23] <edk> where i am that would cost millions
[00:40:27] <manicennui> Sure, but I'm saying it isn't very expensive for that area.
[00:40:29] <imode> which means have fucking fun getting financing.
[00:40:36] <imode> jesus.
[00:40:47] <imode> yeah fuck this I'm going back to being an ewok.
[00:40:55] <manicennui> It is probably overpriced, but not by as much as you think.
[00:41:12] <manicennui> I've seen a couple of flipped houses that have been listed and pending and relisted a couple times.
[00:41:18] <manicennui> I assume they couldn't get approved for a loan.
[00:41:33] <imode> I'm hoping the housing market collapses soon.
[00:41:58] <manicennui> At this point I'd be happy to get what I paid for my condo.
[00:42:02] <manicennui> I just want the fuck out of here.
[00:42:03] <imode> I'm near dead-set on building vs. buying an already built house, so it's more to spite the investments of funds and flippers.
[00:42:39] <manicennui> I'd love to build, but I really don't want to be here for the time it would take to do all that.
[00:42:50] <manicennui> And there isn't a lot available for rent in Asheville.
[00:43:11] <imode> why NC? go up north.
[00:43:15] <edk> imode: it's not just going to spite them, though
[00:43:31] <manicennui> imode: I don't want to deal with winter anymore.
[00:43:38] <edk> if the housing market collapses everyone who already has a mortgage will be stuck for like 20 years
[00:43:50] <manicennui> I've been to NC a couple of times now and really like it.
[00:43:57] <manicennui> Asheville is super progressive.
[00:44:10] <imode> interesting.
[00:44:18] <imode> too south for me.
[00:44:27] <manicennui> Most of the big cities in the South are progressive.
[00:44:36] <manicennui> All of the progressives congregate there.
[00:44:38] <imode> too close to people.
[00:44:56] <imode> I'm talking a minimum 20 miles away from the nearest individual.
[00:45:03] <edk> manicennui: but then you're surrounded by a sea of assholes
[00:45:04] <imode> get me the fuck away from everyone.
[00:45:08] <manicennui> That's going to be a bit hard to find.
[00:45:11] <imode> not really. I had it.
[00:45:20] <imode> then we moved. and I'm still pissed six years later.
[00:45:32] <manicennui> edk: I'm not sure how to take your comment.
[00:46:34] <edk> well, do you want to live in a progressive island in a place where that's the minority view at larger scales?
[00:46:35] <manicennui> 20 miles is a long distance. There are generally some kind of humans within a mile or two almost anywhere in the lower 48.
[00:46:54] <imode> maine is a magical place.
[00:47:01] <manicennui> edk: They aren't minority views anymore though. A lot of the southern states are purple at this point.
[00:47:16] <manicennui> edk: NC has a Democratic governor.
[00:47:43] <manicennui> Their Republican gerrymandered redistricting was just shot down by the NC supreme court.
[00:47:46] <edk> yeah, but still some way off having an evenly split legislature, though in fairness that is not what i claimed
[00:47:57] <manicennui> edk: I'm also a white male.
[00:48:01] <manicennui> I don't tend to have problems with rednecks.
[00:49:10] <edk> i mean, fair enough
[00:49:27] <manicennui> But it's not like there are Bible beaters on every corner in the South.
[00:49:32] <edk> i don't plan on having a family, but if i did i'd be concerned on that score
[00:49:39] <manicennui> I don't either.
[00:49:43] <manicennui> So I'm not worried about it.
[00:49:56] <manicennui> I don't need a lot of social interaction.
[00:50:01] <imode> even if there's no kids involved, quality of life is not okay in purple states.
[00:50:12] <manicennui> I'd probably live on the outskirts of Asheville and spend most of my time on my property.
[00:50:17] <imode> I have a feeling once fucking susan collins, that wretched bitch, is out of office in maine, I'll move back.
[00:51:08] <imode> the healthcare system in NE is, IMO, far better than the west.
[00:51:13] <manicennui> imode: The thing is, none of the big issues affect me personally, and people like me moving there tips things in a positive direction.
[00:52:00] <manicennui> The research triangle is one of the fastest growing areas in the country.
[00:52:07] <manicennui> I think NC will be blue in a decade.
[00:52:46] <imode> let's hope so.
[00:52:47] <manicennui> And it's not like Oregon is without its problems in that area.
[00:52:51] <manicennui> Nor Washington.
[00:52:59] <manicennui> They are both blue, but full of white supremecists.
[00:53:06] <manicennui> Oregon is the birthplace of a lot of those groups.
[00:53:32] <manicennui> Both are also way whiter than NC.
[00:53:51] <imode> tell me about it, my parents live near white supremacist nutjobs.
[00:53:57] <imode> their neighbors also burn fucking plastic.
[00:54:04] <imode> which I have half a mind to get them arrested for.
[00:54:08] <edk> i don't think there's anywhere that *doesn't* have non-negligible amounts of white supremacists
[00:54:17] <imode> *in america.
[00:54:23] <manicennui> edk: It's actually a lot worse in Oregon than you would expect.
[00:54:30] <edk> that is what i meant, but it's true of some other places too
[00:54:33] <manicennui> People don't realize how small the blue part of the state is.
[00:54:44] <edk> some of the "nice" european countries are surprisingly bad on that front
[00:55:40] <manicennui> Oregon is also where that right wing standoff happened.

[01:16:06] * manicennui gives his Mac an hour to update
[01:30:52] <gwozniak> Okay. So I finished this book.  It is truly insane
[01:31:25] <gwozniak> There ends up being a QR code in the stars that opens a website in another universe
[01:31:52] <gwozniak> It's special because there is no address in the address bar
[01:33:18] <gwozniak> And it turns out the universe is collapsing (they totally misread all the evidence!) and they use the particle accelerator at the CERN to communicate with, and possibly teleport, to a parallel universe
[01:33:49] <manicennui> Unless "they" is rich people and politicians, that sounds completely implausible.
[01:33:50] <gwozniak> But whether that happens is probably in the next book in the series, which I will not be reading
[01:34:00] <gwozniak> Well...
[01:34:25] <gwozniak> The general public is unaware of all of this, apparently
[01:34:37] <Brekkjern> If you want to read trash tier sci-fi I would recommend Expeditionary Force. At least that has redeeming qualities.
[01:34:52] <gwozniak> Oh, and the Mayans... knew about this QR code...?
[01:35:32] <gwozniak> Anyway, there was a dirty bomb that destoryed Melbourne and all of Alan Turing's bloodline are math geniuses, etc.
[01:35:43] <gwozniak> So, like, totally nutzoid
[01:36:12] <Brekkjern> Yeah. Expeditionary Force sounds much more fun
[01:36:20] <gwozniak> I got the first three books of The Expanse, so, I'm looking forward to that
[01:38:40] <Brekkjern> They are pretty decent, but nothing amazing
[01:38:44] <gwozniak> Brekkjern: maybe after I get through some of The Exapanse
[01:41:12] <gerikson> Brekkjern: it's not fash-adjacent milporn ?
[01:41:54] <Brekkjern> Eh. It's "military good" but the main character is an absolute doofus, so...
[01:42:14] <gerikson> lol this gun youtuber I follow almost published a memoir about fighthing in the Azov Battalion by a Swedish neo-Nazi
[01:43:11] <gerikson> and people were well mad
[01:48:25] <manicennui> I feel like we want material like that.
[01:48:29] <manicennui> But I get the problem.
[01:48:40] <manicennui> We should have records of what these people did though.
[01:49:24] <manicennui> If Hitler kept detailed records we'd want to have them available
[01:51:09] <gerikson> lol so HN is in a tizzy about Joe Rogan eps being deleted, and now it looks as if it's Rogan himself who has asked them to be taken down because he's saying the N-word

[01:57:15] <gerikson> jfc
[01:57:25] <gerikson> dumbest timeline
[01:57:26] <manicennui> Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said on Saturday it was fraud for GoFundMe to “commandeer” $9 million in donations sent to the Freedom Convoy in support of the truckdrivers and said he would work with his state’s attorney general, Ashley Moody, to investigate. “(T)hese donors should be given a refund.”
[01:57:31] <manicennui> I actually agree with that part.
[01:57:35] <manicennui> It's just stupidity all around.
[01:58:50] <gerikson> yeah agree the money should have been returned
[01:59:19] <gerikson> this just makes people mad
[01:59:42] <gerikson> but thre's plenty of nazi fundrasing sites they can use
[01:59:49] <manicennui> They did change course they. They are going to refund it, after a week.
[01:59:53] <gerikson> dunno why thy used GfM
[02:01:05] <manicennui> Frankly, Canada should be much harsher to the "protesters".
[02:01:41] <manicennui> Even ignoring all of the smaller crimes they are supposedly committing, the blockade of the city should lead to drastic action.
[02:02:00] <manicennui> Especially for those who aren't actually Canadian.
[02:02:17] <gerikson> yeah it's weird
[02:02:44] <gerikson> dunno what's going on
[02:02:51] <gerikson> police on their side?
[02:03:51] <manicennui> Police are doing nothing.
[02:04:03] <gerikson> sus
[02:04:05] <gerikson> very sus
[02:04:25] <manicennui> They don't seem to be very different from American cops
[02:04:57] <gerikson> newp
[02:05:20] <gwozniak> Yeah, the police are doing fuck all there
[02:06:16] <gwozniak> Yet, they are happy to point rifles at those protesting land claims
[02:06:21] <gwozniak> Or BLM stuff
[02:06:40] <gwozniak> Or those protesting treatment of the homeless
[02:08:16] <manicennui> It's amazing how obviously racist cops are in North America
[02:08:24] <gwozniak> The funny thing is that they are "protesting" in Ottawa, but it's the provinces that set public health policy
[02:08:56] <gwozniak> They are now moving to the provincial captials, but I have a feeling those are not going to be as bad
[02:09:18] <gwozniak> There are already counterprotests, like cyclists blocking the trucks
[02:09:34] <gwozniak> I'm half considering going to Toronto to take part
[02:09:53] <gwozniak> If I did live there, I would be
[02:10:31] <gwozniak> Bitching at Trudeau about vaccine mandates is a waste of time, if you actually want the policy changed
[02:10:49] <gwozniak> Of course, this has fuck all to do with vaccine policies
[02:11:19] <gwozniak> Even the trucking alliances are against this "protest"
[02:11:38] <gwozniak> And I'm sure most of the money in the GoFundMe is foriegn money at this point
[02:12:02] <gwozniak> The people who organized that GfM have nothing to do with the trucking industry
[02:12:53] <gwozniak> They are right-wing leaders.  The Conservatives here, according to them, have "betrayed Canada" because they have Muslim members
[02:14:07] <gwozniak> The only good thing, in the short term, is that this will fracture the political right in Canada, so the Conservatives will probably be unelectable
[02:14:57] <manicennui> One would hope.
[02:15:36] <manicennui> But people like to disappoint.
[02:16:53] <gwozniak> The majority of people don't agree with the convoy
[02:17:26] <gwozniak> And if the right splits between the PPC and the Conservatives, there's no way the Conservatives will win
[02:21:58] <manicennui> Unfortunately we don't have multiple right-wing parties in the US, unless you count the Democrats.
[02:22:52] <manicennui> Most people will continue voting for Republicans based on one or two issues.

[02:52:27] <companion_cube> In all seriousness, if you're american and go occupy a Canadian city, you should go to jail, full stoo
[02:52:29] <companion_cube> Stop
[02:53:06] <companion_cube> If you donate to the movement, even that is basically foreign interference. I know I'm careful to avoid that.

[02:56:10] <manicennui> Baguette on every corner!
[02:58:52] <ngoldbaum> cops always seem to treat right wing protests with kid gloves
[02:58:53] <ngoldbaum> curious
[03:00:08] <prussian> Is it a shocker though?
[03:00:17] <prussian> I mean honestly.
[03:00:26] <manicennui> I didn't know cops were that bad in Canada.
[03:00:36] <manicennui> They seem just like us.
[03:01:24] <prussian> I know plenty of right wing Canucks. They got all the same people.
[03:03:51] <companion_cube> we found good baguette today
[03:03:58] <companion_cube> a french bakery in Georgetown
[03:04:47] <companion_cube> ngoldbaum: I guess people who want to join the cops because they have a desire for power or a taste for violence, also tend to share the same proto fascist traits as right wing protesters
[03:05:34] <ngoldbaum> those that work forces and all that
[03:07:16] * manicennui wonders whether companion_cube is familiar with Rage
[03:11:29] <companion_cube> am not
[03:11:37] <companion_cube> but I've seen "the punisher" stickers on cop cars
[03:11:50] <companion_cube> there's apparently a book on the militarization of police forces in the US
[03:11:54] <companion_cube> I should read that
[03:13:15] <manicennui> Nah, Rage Against The Machine is a left wing rock/rap group that right wingers like because their music is good as fuck
[03:13:20] <manicennui> But they don't understand the lyrics

[03:13:40] <companion_cube> thought "rage" was a different thing.
[03:14:16] <manicennui> No, sorry.
[03:15:43] <companion_cube> I find it funny that right wing people consider themselves to be anti system
[03:15:57] <companion_cube> guess everyone is against _part_ of the system
[03:18:30] <manicennui> They don't really understand the things they say. They mostly parrot other people.
[03:18:43] <manicennui> They want a big government, but they want it to focus on other things.
[03:18:57] <manicennui> They are also fine with things like welfare as long as their families are the ones getting it.
[03:22:40] <companion_cube> :/
[03:22:46] <companion_cube> it's a tribal thing, is all

[04:27:38] <vladimyr> Not really but this is an interesting read https://blog.sigstore.dev/celebrating-1-000-000-entries-in-rekor-1950b7c150df
[04:35:20] <drakonis> the main question is, why?
[04:36:35] <vladimyr> To make it easier for folks to distribute software who's authenticity can be verified?
[04:36:57] <vladimyr> I guess same reasons why openbsd folks sign their releases and ports
[04:39:27] <drakonis> not that, i mean why retread existing paths?
[04:39:56] <vladimyr> What do you mean by that?
[04:41:49] <drakonis> i mean that it is reinventing processes that linux distributions figured out
[04:42:01] <drakonis> guix, nix, fedora, debian
[04:43:02] <vladimyr> I wouldn't say they are reinventing it but simplifying and opening to wider audience so to say
[04:43:28] <vladimyr> Plus distro processes aren't that great tbh
[04:44:01] <vladimyr> They do work but they are definitely not flawless
[04:44:43] <drakonis> also check out software heritage
[04:44:58] <vladimyr> And at the end of the day it is not just only for distributing software

[04:45:59] <drakonis> real deal.
[04:47:28] <manicennui> Obviously we need blockchain for this.
[04:48:12] <drakonis> i find that sigstore is a lot like theather
[04:48:14] <drakonis> theater
[04:48:25] <companion_cube> fun fact: some people from the software heritage aren't too far from the people of tezos
[04:48:28] <drakonis> its using a goddamn blockchain
[04:48:31] <drakonis> ha, i know
[04:48:33] <drakonis> frenchmen :V
[04:48:34] <companion_cube> it's basically the french OCaml community :D
[04:49:48] <drakonis> inria, everyone.
[04:50:08] <vladimyr> Huh, I skimmed through that sigstore example and didn't see anything that much off-putting
[04:50:20] <vladimyr> Looking into sw heritage...
[04:50:38] <vladimyr> But seems like completely different idea
[04:51:01] <vladimyr> I get that there is obvious intersection but still
[04:51:09] <drakonis> sigstore is basically a bunch of people publishing signatures for artifacts, its hardly novel
[04:52:02] <vladimyr> Didn't say it is novel :)
[04:52:17] <vladimyr> This sw heritage thing is really cool
[04:52:35] <drakonis> indeed it is.
[04:52:37] <vladimyr> i wonder is there github action for autosubmitting stuff
[04:52:46] <drakonis> hmmm
[04:52:47] <vladimyr> Like submit on release
[04:52:49] <drakonis> why though
[04:53:10] <drakonis> what's the point of github actions anyways
[04:53:15] <companion_cube> CI?
[04:53:25] <vladimyr> ^ this
[04:54:18] <vladimyr> I mean doesn't have to be GitHub action, just some code I can provide with few config vars that can be run as part of CI pipeline
[04:54:57] <drakonis> the second option is available
[04:55:58] <drakonis> there's an API you can call

[14:59:48] <vladimyr> Simply says rust edition 2018

[15:11:18] <vladimyr> Didn't try building master I hope

[20:25:01] <manicennui> On Friday, Reuters reported that J&J secretly launched "Project Plato" last year to shift liability from about 38,000 pending Baby Powder talc lawsuits to a newly created subsidiary, which was then to be put into bankruptcy. By doing so, J&J could limit its financial exposure to the lawsuits.

[20:25:16] <manicennui> Fucking revoke their corporate charter and sell off their assets
[20:27:05] <manicennui> The company has said it placed LTL into bankruptcy to settle those claims rather than litigating them individually. It has said resolving these claims through Chapter 11 is a legitimate use of the restructuring process.

[20:34:12] <manicennui> Facing thousands of lawsuits alleging that its talc caused cancer, J&J insists on the safety and purity of its iconic product. But internal documents examined by Reuters show that the company's powder was sometimes tainted with carcinogenic asbestos and that J&J kept that information from regulators and the public.
[20:34:35] <manicennui> Fucking liquidate the company.

[20:34:54] <gerikson> wow

[20:35:33] *** Joins: jeho (~jehoshaph@user/jehoshaphat)
[20:36:02] <manicennui> A Reuters examination of many of those documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, shows that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, and that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.
[20:36:30] <manicennui> The documents also depict successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators’ plans to limit asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on the health effects of talc.
[20:39:55] <manicennui> Seems we have known about this since the 70s.
[20:40:14] <manicennui> But they have been able to hold regulators off since then.

[20:40:56] <manicennui> On June 29, 1971, Kretchmer informed the Nixon administration and called a press conference to announce that two unidentified brands of cosmetic talc appeared to contain asbestos.
[20:41:17] <manicennui> Langer, Selikoff and Kretchmer ended up on a J&J list of “antagonistic personalities” in a Nov. 29, 1972, memo, which described Selikoff as the leader of an “attack on talc.”

[21:19:33] <manicennui> Is anything Trump does truly startling?
[21:19:44] <gwozniak> It's important to note that the number of people on the ground for this convoy is not actually very large
[21:20:02] <gwozniak> The headline is silly, but the content is useful
[21:20:04] <Brekkjern> manicennui: I thought it was rather startling that he said he was vaccinated?
[21:20:35] <manicennui> Brekkjern: Nah, he doesn't do the things he tells his cult to do.
[21:20:44] <manicennui> Everything he says is about getting what he wants.
[21:20:56] <Brekkjern> Of course, which is why it's startling that he actually said it
[21:21:06] <manicennui> I don't even think he is very racist.
[21:21:15] <manicennui> He is just fine with courting them to help him get what he wants.

[21:54:14] <prussian> I mean, ya. they do.
[21:54:29] <imode> "I have the freedom to damage my children any way I like."
[21:54:37] <prussian> pretty much.
[21:54:39] <manicennui> Most of these parents will act surprised when their children rebel hard as fuck later, and possibly even become estranged.
[21:54:44] <companion_cube> I wonder if having private libraries could be a thing.
[21:54:45] <imode> they really shouldn't have tha tright.
[21:54:52] <imode> *that right.
[21:54:55] <companion_cube> I'll definitely keep these books home
[21:55:15] <companion_cube> (can we ban Ayn Rand books? :P :p)
[21:55:20] <imode> lmao
[21:55:30] <prussian> imode: I mean, sure, but how do we get to that state?
[21:55:31] <companion_cube> promotes radical ideologies
[21:55:49] <prussian> even subtly, parenting changes how a kid is going to learn and behave.
[21:55:59] <imode> prussian: we're already in that state. which is why we're arguing over public education.
[21:55:59] <manicennui> companion_cube: If you tried that they'd probably try to call you anti-semitic.
[21:56:10] <manicennui> While flying the Nazi flag.
[21:56:30] <prussian> in what state? where kids aren't allowed to be forced into the strange and puritanical teaching of nuts?
[21:56:48] <prussian> I mean you have whole DNS companies to censor internets and all sorts of stupid shit.
[21:57:00] <imode> no, that kids have the obligation to attend some sort of education outside of their own home.
[21:57:23] <prussian> oh
[21:57:25] <imode> parents don't have the right to withhold schooling from their kids.
[21:57:31] <imode> so we're "already there" in some sense.
[21:57:43] <companion_cube> manicennui: they are trying to ban "Maus"
[21:57:50] <companion_cube> ah, well, yes, hypocrisy
[21:59:01] <imode> I rarely read books anymore.
[21:59:32] <companion_cube> you are banning books from yourself, imode, be careful
[21:59:59] <manicennui> companion_cube: Yes, but words don't have meaning to them. They are only a tool for attacking others.
[22:01:01] <manicennui> Anti-semitism is their real reason for waning Maus banned, just as racism is their real reason for wanting some book about MLK Jr. banned.
[22:01:21] <manicennui> wanting
[22:01:31] <imode> I should read Maus.
[22:01:42] <imode> some of the illustrations on wikipedia are.. interesting.
[22:01:55] <companion_cube> I should, too
[22:02:23] <imode> tbf if that's "light" for the novel I can kind of see why it'd be looked at with eyebrows raised.
[22:03:01] <companion_cube> oh wow it won a Pullitzer
[22:03:19] <companion_cube> imode: for high school, imho, anything goes
[22:03:28] <imode> high school yeah.
[22:03:33] <companion_cube> that's when you should read stuff about the real world and the ugliest parts of history
[22:03:34] <manicennui> They banned or tried to ban George Takei's graphic novel about Japanese internment camps too.
[22:03:44] <imode> agreed.
[22:03:54] <companion_cube> of course they did
[22:03:59] <companion_cube> the US did nothing wrong!™

[22:05:04] <buttsbot> Twitter - georgetakei - A school district in PA earlier tried to ban my graphic memoir, “They Called Us Enemy.” It’s about growing up in a Japanese...

[22:05:34] <manicennui> This is what we should do everywhere: https://twitter.com/smc429/status/1487464237756649475
[22:05:35] <buttsbot> Twitter - smc429 - How cool is this! Middle school children are forming book clubs to read all the books GOP Nazis are banning https://t.co/kwD8RXm0y1
[22:05:39] <imode> ... in _philadelphia_?
[22:05:45] <imode> jesus.
[22:06:20] <manicennui> They are certainly triggering a lot of Streisand effect.
[22:06:45] <manicennui> Several people have offered to ship Maus for free to anyone in the Tennessee area where the book was banned.
[22:06:50] <companion_cube> book clubs!!!! awesome
[22:06:54] <manicennui> And I bet there is an uptick in purchases.
[22:07:09] <companion_cube> Brekkjern: 😂
[22:07:21] <imode> in that same thread there's a reference to a bill in the florida state legislature.
[22:07:26] <companion_cube> did he get stoned to dead?
[22:07:27] <manicennui> I bet there are some gay closeted teens out there finding out about books they might enjoy.
[22:07:53] <imode> the "Don't Say Gay" bill.
[22:07:55] <imode> are you for real.
[22:08:09] <manicennui> 'Mercia!
[22:08:19] <manicennui> I butchered that
[22:08:26] <manicennui> But I think it's still fitting.
[22:08:33] <imode> fuck me, even Maine had education on LGBTQ+ history.
[22:09:03] <companion_cube> I think we should talk a lot about the "don't say gay" bill
[22:09:05] <imode> we're the south of the north. :\
[22:09:06] <companion_cube> especially say its name a lot
[22:17:11] <manicennui> I think we should let FL sink into the sea.
[22:23:56] <imode> let's do it.
[22:24:09] <imode> easiest non-action I've ever taken.
[22:27:34] <manicennui> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FKSNNJNXIAYzawP?format=jpg&name=900x900
[22:27:49] <manicennui> imode: I'm willing to help it along if I can.
[22:28:22] <manicennui> Someone start a GFM to sink Florida.
[22:29:27] <imode> just keep doing crypto mining.
[22:34:01] <manicennui> I never started

[22:53:42] <manicennui> Great song
[22:53:51] <imode> genuinely good series.
[22:55:12] <imode> the two lead creators on this do all the animation, scripts, etc. themselves. they've been working on getting something on a major network for like, decades. they were originally from newgrounds.
[22:58:05] <manicennui> Looks good
[22:59:14] *** Quits: ehammarstrom (~ehammarst@62-20-203-39-no182.tbcn.telia.com) (Remote host closed the connection)
[23:08:16] <manicennui> Yet another show I'd need to subscribe to Hulu to watch.
[23:09:55] <imode> it's on adult swim's site.
[23:10:08] <imode> you can log in with a cable provider.
[23:10:41] <Brekkjern> Yarr harr!
[23:19:15] <manicennui> imode: I don't have cable TV
[23:35:06] <imode> yarr harr it then.
[23:45:05] <manicennui> Might get above freezing here this week.
[23:47:34] <Brekkjern> I don't know why I keep refreshing the time left for the resilvering... It's still like 2 days left
