[00:14:24] <morlog> about 8 months ago
[00:15:31] <macrobat> the time spent on finding a small percent difference could be used to get it immediately and not risk it while unvaxxed

[00:18:55] <murthy> DOMF: hi
[00:19:20] <murthy> DOMF:where can I find the efficacy rates of vaccines for the delta variant of the virus
[00:19:24] <louipc> DOMF: oh didnt seem like it
[00:20:14] <DOMF> it definitely is, it's just that *immediate* protection from the vaccine (as seen in antibody levels) declines from 4-8 months or so 
[00:20:29] <DOMF> and since Delta replicates so fast, it's considered less effective because of that
[00:20:37] <DOMF> but still extremely effective at preventing death
[00:20:57] <murthy> ya
[00:21:45] <louipc> where'd you find the rates
[00:22:24] <DOMF> the rates of death prevention/ 
[00:22:25] <DOMF> ?
[00:22:38] <DOMF> (also my statements are only for the US based vaccines) 
[00:22:53] <DOMF> murthy, TBH I don't know if there's any good centralized resource for that
[00:22:57] <murthy> DOMF: efficacy rates
[00:22:57] <louipc> nvm ;)
[00:23:10] <louipc> how bout some music
[00:23:16] <murthy> DOMF: Is covaxin ok?

[00:23:29] <Janet`> ^ auspice
[00:23:54] <louipc> wen omega omega
[00:23:56] <murthy> It has the least efficacy rates compared to all the others but they say its very safe as it is made with inactivated virus
[00:24:36] <DOMF> I'm very curious about COVAXIN, for that specific reason 
[00:24:58] <DOMF> but I haven't seen any long-term efficiency studies (I don't think anyone's had it approved for long enough?)

[00:25:57] <louipc> circuitbone: then what
[00:26:08] <louipc> thanks macrobat 
[00:26:10] <DOMF> but I think conveying longer lasting immunity based on that is a really interesting hypothesis 
[00:26:25] <DOMF> because it gives your body more shit to target than just the spike protein 
[00:26:37] <circuitbone> Remind yourself this isn't the first or last plague and move on
[00:27:05] <murthy> DOMF: after the reports of blood clot side effects from covishield people here started opting for covaxin. Earlier people opted for covishield since it was only approved for travel abroad

[00:30:10] <louipc> you could just get all the vaxxes
[00:30:15] <louipc> then you would be ultra safe
[00:30:42] <circuitbone> mixing the two big ones has results that favour that thinking
[00:30:43] <louipc> so get the ones u can, then travel to get the rest
[00:31:16] <murthy> circuitbone, louipc, sputnik kind of does that
[00:31:28] <louipc> get booster every 2 weeks
[00:31:38] <murthy> for sputnik dose one and two are different types
[00:31:51] <DOMF> I mean, I think crossing off the AZ one is probably a good bet 
[00:31:56] <DOMF> they've been a shitshow
[00:32:01] <louipc> but i guess depends on what kind of perfectionist you are
[00:32:31] <circuitbone> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_mutation If you generate a non silent mutation that goes on to kill 30 million people, how bad would you feel then if this is an emotional decision for you.

[13:55:56] <hype> Hello.
[13:56:52] <Icculus_42> How's it goin?
[13:57:51] <hype> I listen to music on Apple Music. It's fun.
[13:59:16] <hype> Icculus_42 Are you from NYC?

[14:02:31] <Icculus_42> NY, but not NYC
[14:02:45] <hype> I see.
[14:03:06] <Icculus_42> And I try my best to avoid anything Apple... I have spotify (even though they're a pretty horrible company as well)
[14:03:55] <buZz> Icculus_42: Hamburg? :D
[14:04:13] <buZz> cracks me up how uncreative the town names are in US :D
[14:05:16] <Icculus_42> Haha no, but I do know some people from there!
[14:05:18] <hype> My uncle lives in NYC. He is a musician.
[14:06:05] <hype> He lives around Ground Zero.
[14:06:31] <buZz> Icculus_42: the NY Governor is from there :D
[14:06:42] <buZz> she was half demanding ppl go back to office work
[14:06:53] <Icculus_42> I don't think I could ever live in NYC... too much chaos everywhere all the time!
[14:06:57] <buZz> (while owning over 2M usd of office buildings that have been empty for years)
[14:07:19] <redempt1on> My Brother lives in Chicago. He is a drug dealer.
[14:07:23] <buZz> meanwhile NYC rent prices still massively inflated -while- half the town standing empty
[14:07:28] <buZz> redempt1on: nice, which drugs?
[14:07:34] <redempt1on> meth, coke, crack
[14:07:37] <redempt1on> want his address?
[14:07:45] <Icculus_42> Ah, nothing good lol
[14:07:47] <buZz> why meth and not normal amphetamine?
[14:07:48] <redempt1on> :-)
[14:07:52] <redempt1on> crystal meth is pure
[14:07:54] <redempt1on> more pure
[14:07:56] <buZz> Icculus_42: my thoughts exactly :P
[14:07:58] <buZz> redempt1on: lol no
[14:08:03] <redempt1on> crystals ice glass
[14:08:03] <redempt1on> shards
[14:08:09] <buZz> methylamphetamine is something else than normal amphetamine
[14:08:14] <buZz> the latter is what people call 'speed'
[14:08:20] <redempt1on> it's way more powerful than regular amphetamine
[14:08:25] <buZz> nope
[14:08:28] <redempt1on> vyvanse, desoxy = amphetmaine
[14:08:33] <redempt1on> prescripton drugs
[14:08:38] <buZz> adderal too
[14:08:47] <redempt1on> adderral is not straight up aphetamine
[14:08:49] <buZz> well, dexamphetamine
[14:08:50] <redempt1on> it has other stuff
[14:08:58] <redempt1on> I have a dexedrine prescripiton
[14:09:05] <buZz> redempt1on: nope, its straight up half the isomers of amphetamine
[14:09:06] <redempt1on> dexedrine is much, much better than adderrall
[14:09:15] <redempt1on> amphetamine do you mean street or RX?
[14:09:24] <redempt1on> cause the 'street' amphetamine like the paste is pretty dodgy
[14:09:32] <buZz> RX is Dextroamphetamine usually
[14:09:32] <redempt1on> the peanut butter yellow paste
[14:09:38] <redempt1on> Yes I have dex
[14:09:39] <buZz> like adderall and dexedrine
[14:09:42] <redempt1on> I have 50+ caps in my bedroom
[14:09:46] <Icculus_42> This is weird, I'm seeing like this exact same chat going on is the only 2 active chats I'm in lol
[14:09:46] <redempt1on> 15 MG extended release.
[14:09:47] <buZz> thats nice
[14:09:52] <redempt1on> They are so fun to snort
[14:09:53] <buZz> hahaha
[14:09:53] <redempt1on> grind up the balls
[14:09:54] <redempt1on> m mm mmm
[14:09:58] <buZz> Icculus_42: should we stop?
[14:10:08] <redempt1on> Yeah we cant talk about drugs. were like totally virgins
[14:10:09] <redempt1on> or something
[14:10:12] <buZz> redempt1on: Lisdexamfetamine is cool too
[14:10:16] <redempt1on> what is that?
[14:10:20] <redempt1on> where do I ge it?
[14:10:22] <buZz> it metabolizes in body into dextroamphetamine
[14:10:24] <buZz> its RX
[14:10:25] <redempt1on> where do I get vyvanse and desoxyn online
[14:10:32] <redempt1on> My girl here cant get those
[14:10:34] <redempt1on> locally
[14:10:36] <redempt1on> and shes probably going to jail
[14:10:40] <buZz> dont know, i just have a ADHD stamp :P
[14:10:40] <redempt1on> not my GF, just a gangster girl
[14:10:52] <redempt1on> =)
[14:10:52] <buZz> RX is so easy to get, just do it
[14:10:58] <redempt1on> I already have dex RX
[14:11:00] <redempt1on> with current family Dr
[14:11:02] <redempt1on> he will not give me that
[14:11:07] <buZz> he will
[14:11:11] <redempt1on> well, I'd have to switch
[14:11:19] <redempt1on> and dexedrine is awesome, so
[14:11:27] <buZz> Lisdexamfetamine is much easier to produce than slow release dextroamphetamine
[14:11:34] <buZz> and doesnt need 'retard' on the label
[14:11:35] <buZz> lol
[14:11:49] <redempt1on> is that like Listerine Dexedrine?
[14:12:10] <Icculus_42> They make time relese dex?
[14:12:22] <redempt1on> my friend has been selling me 18/ths for $20 for 2 months
[14:12:39] <buZz> redempt1on: no
[14:12:46] <redempt1on> I got in touch with my ex boss. its a lil bit more of a drive, but he sells quarters for $30 and its much better
[14:12:51] <redempt1on> better, bigger, fresher buds
[14:12:54] <redempt1on> condensed
[14:12:54] <buZz> redempt1on: in the world, drugs are called by drugnames
[14:12:57] <redempt1on> "friends" that rip you off
[14:13:00] <buZz> not by commercial brands
[14:13:27] <redempt1on> and the ex boss game like 2 gram samples of some cherry strain and grape strain
[14:13:31] <redempt1on> and the 1/4 I bought was OPK
[14:13:39] <redempt1on> but people on IRC dont liek drugs or sex so I should not talk about it
[14:13:47] <buZz> they dont?
[14:13:51] <buZz> lol > One review highlighted a nine-month randomized controlled trial of amphetamine treatment for ADHD in children that found an average increase of 4.5 IQ points
[14:13:54] <redempt1on> Yeah i've been banned from a lot of channels
[14:13:57] <redempt1on> for talking about drugs or dating or sex
[14:14:01] <redempt1on> perm banned pretty much
[14:14:04] <buZz> redempt1on: well if its all you do
[14:14:07] <redempt1on> Even talking about women and dating and sex
[14:14:09] <buZz> that gets old pretty fast
[14:14:15] <redempt1on> nobody wants to talk about sexual experiences or women
[14:14:15] <buZz> np: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaSSMQVybzE

[14:14:33] <redempt1on> bruh
[14:14:34] <buZz> its not a boysclub 
[14:14:37] <buZz> be inclusive
[14:14:39] <redempt1on> it's like 90 % + men
[14:14:41] <redempt1on> or 99 %
[14:14:43] <Icculus_42> You folks into psychedelics at all? This is a music chat after all, and I feel like the 2 kinda go hand in hand
[14:14:47] <buZz> you wont spam your mom naked women
[14:14:50] <redempt1on> I had mushrooms :-[)
[14:14:52] <buZz> Icculus_42: oh quite
[14:14:57] <buZz> LSD every now and then
[14:15:01] <redempt1on> Everyone gets pissed off when you mentiong dating or sex
[14:15:03] <redempt1on> or even weed 
[14:15:22] <buZz> highly recommend LSD at least once in your (early) adult life
[14:15:30] <redempt1on> a guy libera is a 34 year old virgin who says "Everyone on IRC is a virgin, or else they wouldn't be on IRC"
[14:15:32] <buZz> quite a eyeopener
[14:15:43] <Icculus_42> I agree!
[14:15:52] <buZz> all my 'big' relationships i've had, started on IRC
[14:15:56] <redempt1on> yeah
[14:16:01] <buZz> one of 7 , one of 5 years
[14:16:08] <buZz> all girls i met on IRC first 
[14:16:09] <redempt1on> I've known of relationships and marriages on IRC
[14:16:16] <redempt1on> the fact the woman is on IRC all the time is like the huge first red flag
[14:16:16] <redempt1on> <g>
[14:16:17] <buZz> who wouldnt have been talking to me if i was redempt1on 
[14:16:25] <buZz> and spamming naked women and commenting about pr0n
[14:16:34] <redempt1on> yeah I meet women where I live
[14:16:40] <redempt1on> IRC women yeah probably not a good idea
[14:16:41] <redempt1on> just saying
[14:16:45] <buZz> redempt1on: do you confront them with porn directly?
[14:16:53] <redempt1on> i never once said I pasted porn
[14:17:02] <buZz> 11:44:20 < redempt1on> nobody wants to see women pics
[14:17:06] <buZz> ^
[14:17:09] <buZz> you implied it
[14:17:12] <redempt1on> women pics = automatically porn

[14:17:20] <redempt1on> Anyone can meet up with someone on Tinder if they are not uggo
[14:17:22] <buZz> yeah, that was implied from your context

[14:17:40] <buZz> as i refuse to use smartphones
