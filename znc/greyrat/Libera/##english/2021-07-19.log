[10:07:42] <StayHungry> i wonder if there are any reputable sources left in Englsh-speaking world which still adhere that singular they is... a controversial thing?

[10:12:31] <rindolf> StayHungry: i used singular "they" in the past, but now use "he" again at times.
[10:13:29] <ksft> it could *maybe* be considered nonstandard when referring to specific people of known (binary) gender
[10:13:50] <ksft> but it's been used for centuries generically
[10:13:59] <ksft> including by Shakespeare and in the King James Bible
[10:14:10] <rindolf> KJV used it too, yes
[10:14:24] <ksft> it's actually older than the singular "you"

[10:15:18] <StayHungry> ksft: used does not mean common. for example, i use word 'invective' on par with ancient ancestors, whereas it's not common in English.

[10:17:01] <ksft> StayHungry: I don't think I understand your point
[10:17:55] <ksft> I meant that it's been standard usage for centuries
[10:18:01] <kompowiec> just because you can change any word in English because there is no inflection, does not mean that in other languages it is possible.
[10:18:30] <ksft> was that person an English speaker?
[10:18:38] <twb> kompowiec: English has inflexion, just not for gender (mostly)
[10:18:43] <StayHungry> also, i live both outside of golden billion and gender-whatever discourse, so that wikipedia article written by you know whom is not relevant. i'm looking not for fashion advice, but for sources that still stick to what is make sense grammatically, not politically.
[10:18:50] <ksft> if so, you could respond by pointing to words that are always gendered in English
[10:18:55] <ksft> like "neice"/"nephew"
[10:19:04] <kompowiec> he knew another language, but it was not a inflection language
[10:19:07] <twb> kompowiec: pronouns still inflect for gender, as does the adjective "blond/blonde" and, historically, some jobs (e.g. "invigilator/invigilatrix")
[10:19:24] <ksft> some jobs still do
[10:19:25] <kompowiec> negress :P
[10:19:39] <ksft> "waiter"/"waitress", "actor"/"actress"
[10:19:50] <twb> ksft: depending on the dialect, yes
[10:19:51] <ksft> the masculine one is also generic in all cases I can think of, though
[10:20:07] <kompowiec> > invigilatrix
[10:20:08] <kompowiec> i never heard of it

[10:20:36] <twb> kompowiec: it is a woman who prevents students from cheating during an exam
[10:20:48] <kompowiec> oo
[10:21:04] <twb> kompowiec: "doctress" and "actress" and "aviatrix" are attested more commonly.
[10:21:06] <ksft> "proctor", in American English
[10:21:15] <twb> Also "danceuse"
[10:21:25] <kompowiec> that's what I was gonna say, it's from the British
[10:21:25] <twb> ksft: well... "proctress" in that case ;-)
[10:21:33] <ksft> what variant uses "doctress"?
[10:21:49] <twb> ksft: none anymore, but it was readily apparent in the early 1900s
[10:21:53] <kompowiec> I only know the American dialect, probably because of its ubiquitous presence.
[10:22:27] <twb> kompowiec: I'd have thought Poland more likely to use British due to proximity, but I guess all the rest of western europe is in between you
[10:22:37] <ksft> I think mandatory gendering is unfortunate in languages, but it's ridiculous to suggest that people who use those languages are doing something wrong
[10:22:39] <StayHungry> rindolf: how do you deal with those who are eager to correct you when you use 'he'?
[10:22:39] <kompowiec> in theory yes
[10:23:01] <kompowiec> in practice, no one taught me the language at school, I had to learn everything myself.
[10:23:22] <ksft> generic "he" sounds archaic to me 
[10:23:24] <twb> In my experience anyone who understands you're not a native speaker, will be forgiving of such accidents.
[10:23:47] <twb> Unless you go out of your way to repeat the mistake out of bloody-mindedness
[10:24:49] <twb> "Excuse me if you please: the train, she is delayed?"
[10:25:26] <StayHungry> irrelevant example. we talk about he instead of singular they
[10:25:40] <ksft> "she" is sometimes used for things other than people, but it always sounds a little weird to me
[10:25:55] <twb> ksft: in my example above, that was just someone who is a native French speaker
[10:26:14] <ksft> oh, makes sense
[10:26:25] <ksft> but if you replaced "train" with "boat", it could be a native English speaker
[10:26:47] <ksft> (aside from the unusual syntax, I guess)
[10:26:57] <twb> StayHungry: for the specific case of singular they, it is very simple
[10:27:02] <twb> StayHungry: pick a house style, and follow it.
[10:27:21] <twb> StayHungry: if the house style says to avoid singular they, then you can say "the house style says this"
[10:27:33] <StayHungry> not sure what house style is
[10:27:53] <twb> Really this argument is an appeal to authority, but it's better than having a pointless argument
[10:28:06] <twb> StayHungry: a house style is the style guide used by your publishing house.
[10:28:24] <twb> StayHungry: for example, if you write psychology papers you might use the Chicago Manual of Style as your house style
[10:28:52] <StayHungry> "i wonder if there are any reputable sources left in Englsh-speaking world which still adhere that singular they is... a controversial thing? I relied upon Chicago manual of style in this matter, but it seems they too gave up"
[10:29:04] <StayHungry> 30 minutes ago
[10:29:31] <twb> StayHungry: ah I see that
[10:29:47] <twb> StayHungry: I don't know offhand of any actively-maintained style guides that discourage singular they
[10:30:10] <ksft> are you trying to prove that it's controversial for some reason?
[10:31:17] <twb> My current opinion is: this is not an interesting issue.  If you personally dislike singular they, reorder your sentence to avoid it.
[10:32:07] <twb> If you really want a challenge, pick something more aggressive, like "split infinitive is wrong"
[10:32:19] <ksft> I agree with twb
[10:36:03] <StayHungry> ksft: i see this issue is controversial, yes. although singular they has been known for centuries, both formal speech and writings adhered to other options up until very recently (2000s). basically, there was no active dispute until those rainbow fellas took an offense. so instead of discussing what could be called a grammatical gap (e.g. how to address someone of unknown sex instead of sir or miss) you're pushed to use something 
[10:36:03] <StayHungry> non that intuitive (at least for me, a non-native).
[10:37:08] <ksft> I don't think it's true that formal registeres avoided singular they before the 1800s when prescriptivists started telling people they were using their native languages wrong
[10:37:13] <ksft> registers*
[10:37:24] <StayHungry> btw, my solution for that particular sir/miss -> comrade :D
[10:39:13] <ksft> I suspect I'm missing some subtleties of your tone there
[10:39:53] <twb> singular they started in the 1300s, was fine for 500 years, was discouraged by some for 200 years, and is now 100% fine again.
[10:41:37] <ksft> I mean, you might occasionally meet someone who'll imply it's bad and blame it on "those rainbow fellas", but it's still perfectly acceptable at least when referring to someone of unknown gender
[10:41:58] <twb> StayHungry: if you want to complain about this usage being driven by a minority, that minority isn't "rainbow people", homosexuals, or gendered-neutral people.  It's third-wave feminists.
[10:42:16] <twb> (And possible second-wave feminists)
[10:43:24] <twb> And they are primarily critizing things like a law that says "if a driver is drunk he shall pull over and sober up" because does that apply to women drivers?
[10:44:30] <twb> This is unrelated to the usage "Alice, this is Star, they are an archaeologist"
[10:44:33] <kompowiec> at least "thou" isnt controversite :p
[10:44:49] <kompowiec> controversial*
[10:45:09] <twb> kompowiec: right; it's not controversial, because nobody is trying to keep using it :-)
[10:45:22] <StayHungry> oh brother, where art thou :D
[10:45:48] <kompowiec> twb: *I* use it :(
[10:46:12] <twb> StayHungry: "a reference to the Preston Sturges 1941 film Sullivan's Travels, in which the protagonist is a director who wants to film O Brother, Where Art Thou?, a fictitious book about the Great Depression.^[10]"
[10:46:38] <twb> StayHungry: i.e. a historical reference, following historical rules

[20:59:02] <huf> well, not in that particular quote
[20:59:26] <huf> "in" means something more like "under" or "carrying this" or something like that
[21:00:25] *** Joins: tech_exorcist (txrcst@user/tech-exorcist/x-0447479)
[21:05:18] <kurahaupo> In that example I would take "in" as shorthand for something like "in the context of" or "read into". And "at" I would take in the sense of time rather than place
[21:05:58] <huf> nah, this is definitely "under"
[21:06:01] <huf> it's a famous line
[21:06:15] <huf> you know, constantine the great, conquering under the banner of some kind of jesus sign?
[21:06:21] <kurahaupo> Oh, I'd never heard it before
[21:06:40] <kurahaupo> oh, THAT kind of sign
[21:06:47] <huf> I mostly know about it because robert jordan put the "under this sign you will conquer" paraphrase in his wheel of time series
[21:07:05] <huf> but he did change "in" to "under" to avoid this fuckery :)
[21:08:29] <kurahaupo> Maybe Constantine meant it like "in this sign we trust"
