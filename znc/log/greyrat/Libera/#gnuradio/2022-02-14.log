[18:06:59] <funkylab[m]> (GNU Radio's firdes is certainly inspired by a big filter design toolkit, but it's a bit limited. There's fixed-length filter design methods out there, in fact, pretty standard, but they're not part of GR. Why? Because you rarely want a filter of fixed length in software, you want the shortest filter that can do the job, not the best filter you can fit in a given length.)

[21:27:48] <jeija[m]> I have a very simple flow graph where I would like to find some preamble in a stream of symbols using the "Correlation Estimator".
[21:28:15] <jeija[m]> It works fine for 4 samples per symbol, but if I increase that variable to e.g. 8 samples per symbol, it does not work anymore.

[21:42:52] <funkylab[m]> <jeija[m]> "It works fine for 4 samples..." <- does it work when you replace the constellation modulator simply with a "chunks to symbols" and a RRC interpolating filter?
[21:43:18] <funkylab[m]> <LordKalma> "I'm trying to learn some DSP..." <- you've seen pysdr.org ?
[21:43:43] <LordKalma> I haven't, seems cool 
[21:44:15] <LordKalma> for what I needed to do I binded liquid-dsp to python with cffi and just used its stuff :D 
[21:44:43] <funkylab[m]> heh, liquid is sometimes pretty nice
[21:44:53] <LordKalma> sometimes it's a funky API too
[21:44:54] <LordKalma> :p
[21:45:07] <funkylab[m]> of course, I do prefer GNU Radio for most stuff ;) but it also has a funky API
[21:45:08] <funkylab[m]> :D
[21:45:37] <LordKalma> I intend on learning enough to replace liquid with a c++ lib of my own :p
[21:46:29] <funkylab[m]> that sounds pretty fun! Though I'm also fairly sure that liquid (just as GNU Radio) has seen some performance work, so don't expect your own library to generally perform just as quickly
[21:46:37] <LordKalma> hahah I don't
[21:46:55] <LordKalma> since liquid is MIT i've looked into it's source quite a bit 
[21:47:01] <LordKalma> it's not a nice implementation to read
[21:47:05] <LordKalma> omg SO MANY MACROS
[21:47:52] <LordKalma> also, since it depends on <complex.h> to build, msvc is out. in fact, it's generally a pain to build on windows, but I've managed haha
[21:56:10] <jeija[m]> <funkylab[m]> "does it work when you replace..." <- Actually I don't even necessarily need RRC interpolation, rect impulses will do fine for now. Now I'm just wondering how to create my sync word vector without the digital.generic_mod function. What is the best way to unpack + map + repeat symbols given a vector of bytes?
[21:57:08] <funkylab[m]> I kinda described that just there :)
[21:57:43] <funkylab[m]> you use the chunks to symbols block to map integers to complex values, then you use an interpolating FIR filter of sorts (the RRC one is just a specially prepared one for you), with an interpolation set as desired.
[21:58:34] <LordKalma> I've literally wrote stuff like this with liquid+python haha
[21:58:56] <jeija[m]> Okay, but I want to modulate my known preamble and have it in a vector variable afterwards. So do I put the output of some block into a variable or how does that work in GNURadio?
[21:59:01] <LordKalma> modulate, fir_interp, beautiful :D
[22:00:45] <jeija[m]> (I guess I'm asking some pretty basic GNURadio questions here, for me it's kind of the other way round; I do know my way around signal processing in python and C++ in general, but I'm pretty new to GNURadio...)
[22:01:07] <LordKalma> I know none, so it's fine :p
[22:05:51] <jeija[m]> I still don't think I fully understand how to proceed here. Basically, I just want to turn some binary data into symbols (unpack, map, repeat), e.g. 0xaa --> 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 --> 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1 --> 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, ....
[22:05:51] <jeija[m]> I know how to do this in a flow graph, but I have the input and the output in a variable. Is there some way to achieve this with calls to GNURadio helper functions, something like digital.generic_mod, but without RRC interpolation?

[23:33:08] <jeija[m]> Nevermind, I am now using the "FSK Demodulator" and "Sync and create packed PDU" blocks from gr-satellites. Maybe not as flexible, but works like a charm out-of-the-box for my use case :)
