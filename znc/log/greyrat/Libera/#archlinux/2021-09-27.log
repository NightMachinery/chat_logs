[08:42:14] *** Joins: jirido (jirido@gateway/vpn/protonvpn/jirido)
[08:42:30] <rcf> goosestepping__: systemd doesn't really do a whole lot when it comes to power management. Just the bare essentials. 
[08:42:34] <goosestepping__> but like maybe i can attain more efficient power management, ie. a longer duration of battery life.
[08:42:41] <goosestepping__> yes, i see.
[08:42:45] <goosestepping__> okay, thanks!
[08:42:48] <goosestepping__> that helped!
[08:42:50] <goosestepping__> :-D
[08:43:10] <hiya> thurstylark: after archinstall finishes it allows you to do some stuff before you boot in the end. I am in that shell only, I didn't do the first boot only because I know the error already
[08:43:17] <thurstylark> jcbjoe2021: probably not, but depends on what you're working with. There are other support channels to try before doing a pr, though.
[08:43:25] <hiya> I fear I won't be able to get back in or mount the encrypted disk
[08:43:31] <rcf> goosestepping__: as is often the case with these sorts of things, your own use patterns will greatly affect any potential results, so if it's worth doing (i.e. you dislike your current power consumption) it's worth doing your own tests. 
[08:43:49] <goosestepping__> yes, understood.

[10:03:51] <frojnd> I have missconfigured system - shell. External apps like qutebrowser doesn't know about my expored paths I've setup in my fish shell
[10:04:21] <frojnd> I start fish shell within wm: bindsym $mod+Return exec alacritty -e fish
[10:04:34] <thurstylark> is your DE a child of your shell?
[10:04:53] <thurstylark> because if not, your DE won't inherit the env that you set up for your shell
[10:04:57] <frojnd> All the exported paths are inside ~/.config/fish/config.fish
[10:05:17] <frojnd> I use WM
[10:05:25] <thurstylark> what do you use, and how do you start it?
[10:05:25] <frojnd> Pobably similar logic
[10:05:31] <frojnd> I use sway
[10:06:09] <thurstylark> and how do you start it?
[10:06:33] <frojnd> Iside ~/.bash_profile I have: https://termbin.com/bwo0
[10:06:58] <thurstylark> so you're starting sway from bash
[10:07:10] <varl> any reason you are using bash as your login shell and not fish ?

[10:07:34] <varl> alright, just wondering if that was a fish-ism
[10:07:37] <thurstylark> just export the necessary vars in that script before starting sway
[10:07:39] <frojnd> At the times I installed Arch I used bash as my default shell
[10:08:41] <frojnd> thurstylark: isn't there another way? I will have to do this every time I add new path?
[10:08:52] <frojnd> Inside fish and inside ~/bash_profile ?
[10:08:57] <varl> you can change your login shell to fish
[10:09:05] <varl> bypass bash entirely
[10:09:12] <thurstylark> I don't know fish, but if their variable assignment syntax is the same you could put them all in their own file and source it from wherever you want
[10:09:23] <thurstylark> or use any method from here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Environment_variables#Graphical_environment
[10:09:24] <phrik> Title: Environment variables - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
[10:09:51] <thurstylark> bah didn't mean to link to a specific section, but you get my drift

[17:01:10] <ulteq> Fair enough.
[17:01:24] <Namarrgon> if you don't use any of the brltty functionality with qemu then it won't matter that you mask the brltty udev rules

[22:15:44] <johnjay> alt-sysrq is your friend
[22:15:51] <thurstylark> is there a pacman process running?
[22:16:01] <NetSysFire> make sure you have an archiso on a stick first
[22:16:03] <johnjay> remember alt-sysrq-reisub because REI and aSUka are Bei
[22:16:05] <jrdn> one sec I'
[22:16:11] <jrdn> ll confirm but I believe so
[22:16:24] <NetSysFire> if the update caused an update to be stuck and you reboot, your system might not boot
[22:17:02] <jrdn> no pacman process is running, looks like it exited
[22:18:37] <jrdn> is there a lock file associated with an upgrade?  Trying to pacman -Syu again is met with "there is nothing to do"
[22:18:52] <thurstylark> it would complain about the lock file specifically
[22:19:00] <thurstylark> in this case, there's just no updates to run
[22:19:07] <patrykk> NetSysFire: that same when you create symlink for /var/cache/pacman/pkg

[22:20:32] <patrykk> Foxboron: pacman is the core part of the arch linux 
[22:20:38] <NetSysFire> i want an arch branded vacuum because it sucks
[22:20:39] <Foxboron> patrykk: I know. That wasn't the question.
[22:20:46] <thurstylark> NetSysFire: ++
[22:21:05] <patrykk> Foxboron: so if you will have /var/cache/pacman/pkg as symlink and you will perfoem system update

[22:22:20] <patrykk> then pacman will start update, then remove archlinux-keys, the old pacman package , then remove pkg symlink and recreate directory, next will try install new pacman package and will die because will not find pacmage which downloaded before 
[22:22:38] <Foxboron> I know.
[22:22:40] <patrykk> soe you will stay with system wothout pacman and archlinux-keys 
[22:23:39] <patrykk> its ok but could you imagine that pacman not informed me before any action, hey user thake care because you will need to repair your system :P
