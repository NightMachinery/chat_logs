[16:19:55] <nakedeyes> again cultural question: thanksgiving vs christmas. which has more importance, bigger, more relevant etc? are they equal?

[17:52:43] <rawtaz> nakedeyes: personally im not the least interesed in which of thanksgiving and christmas has the most importance, to be honest with you :) there's plenty of much more important and interesting questions to ponder in this world, than to spend time on that.
[17:53:07] <rawtaz> perhaps theres a philosophy or religious channel you can get some more input in?
[17:54:09] <rawtaz> (or be sneaky and s/thanksgiving/kubernetes/ and s/christmas/GKE/ which would surely get you some replies :P)
[18:00:18] <nakedeyes> i guess you are right, softly suggesting that this is a devops channel after all. lemme rephrase: AKS vs GKE vs EKS? which one would you prefer?

[18:21:30] *** Joins: bn_work (uid268505@id-268505.uxbridge.irccloud.com)
[18:21:47] <rawtaz> if "thanksgiving" refers to all the times that there's new vmware bugs/issues/vulns that im not affected by because i keep my infra simple, i vote for that being the most important.
[18:22:02] <rawtaz> gordonjcp: are you a UK fellow?
[18:22:12] <gordonjcp> rawtaz: in a sense
[18:22:22] <gordonjcp> rawtaz: Scottish, not British, very much not UK
[18:34:38] <kubblai> Woohoo a fellow Scotsman
[18:35:44] <kubblai> The question should changed to “Christmas or Hogmanay?” For the jocks :)
[18:41:18] <rawtaz> gordonjcp: ah nice. im hoping scottland will leave the UK and be their own nation/state, but it seems to be slow moving :/
[18:41:40] <Joel> rawtaz you know you can ban someone with a redirect right?
[18:42:17] <Joel> $a:molten$##fix_your_connection
[18:54:06] <rawtaz> Joel: yes
[18:54:30] <rawtaz> i figured i'd give it another day and see if they improve :D if not a temporary ban might do it, we'll see :)
[18:55:09] <rawtaz> im a fan of not exercising powers if it can be avoided
[18:55:33] <rawtaz> i guess their computer went to sleep for now :o
[19:15:31] <Joel> rawtaz hiding join/parts is also a pretty common thing :)
[19:16:12] <rawtaz> Joel: not applicable because it removes the joins/parts and similar messages for the other visitors that dont misbehave
[19:16:22] <rawtaz> that suggestion *always* comes up, but it's simply not a solution :)
[19:16:43] <gordonjcp> rawtaz: same
[19:17:15] <gordonjcp> rawtaz: can you ignore joins and parts from particularly noisy users?  I can't say I've ever tried
[19:18:48] <rawtaz> i dont see how, but surely theres ways to script or confgure an irc client to deal with it some way like that. should i have to spend time investigating that? fuck no.
[19:18:55] <rawtaz> fuck incompetent people, instead.
[19:21:14] <Joel> I've had that setting set for years, never have an issue with it, i use /notify for important people, and the user list is still accurate
[19:22:01] <rawtaz> do you mean a setting of ignoring joins and quits and so on?
[19:22:33] <rawtaz> i suppose /notify adds a "whitelist" such that despite the previous setting you still see info about these people joining/leaving?
