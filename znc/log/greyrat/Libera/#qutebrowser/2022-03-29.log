[06:46:23] <noex> is there a way to block certificate error messages? iDRAC produces them and with qutebrowser is steals focus and won't let you take any other action. it will create one after another endlessly and essentially hijack the browser to where you cannot do anything. no keystrokes respond that don't answer the dialog popup (which then just produces another dialog)
[06:46:59] <noex> there's no "always yes" or "always no" so I end up answering the same question a hundred times
[06:47:34] <noex> or "stop this page from creating dialogs" would be great, because I really don't care
[06:48:24] <noex> oh, it also creates the same loop with an "Authentication required" popup, but no matter how many times you auth, it creates another popup
[06:48:28] <noex> this also hijacks the browser
[06:49:51] <noex> it's random when it will do it, and when it does you literally cannot do any other task because it steals the focus and won't allow mouse clicks or keystrokes anywhere else

[07:43:00] <bedlam> You can also set that in QB, but I can't recall all the settings that it takes.  Best to :set tls<TAB> on a safe page and see what the options are.
[07:47:35] <bedlam> I'm not familiar with idrac, but if it uses plain http auth then you can use ~/.netrc to put your password.

[13:30:22] <The-Compiler> toofar: re "I still would really like the recompile requirements script to tell me where requirement changes came from (what files, where did secondary requirements come from)." - for the former, you mean it listing the requirements file in the table in the GitHub comment?
[13:30:38] <The-Compiler> toofar: for the latter, I don't think it can do that with how it works currently (via pip freeze)
[13:35:36] <toofar> yeah the file. Everytime something not normal happens I want to understand the context and where to focus my attention. Usually dealing with dependancy updates is a small task but having to manually look through changelogs takes time and having more data points to points to problematic candidates would be good
[13:37:31] <toofar> regarding showing where new dependencies came from, maybe I'm paranoid about supply chain attacks but when I seem a new one pop up I tend to want an explanation for it

[21:49:10] <MacGyver> guido: Yes.
[21:49:29] <guido> return is hard to reach and you press it all the time. having it as caps lock is very convenient
[21:49:48] <triallax[m]> I don't think I've ever seen that before, but if it works for you, why not?
[21:50:03] <MacGyver> Do you have one of those weird keyboards with a high-but-narrow return?
[21:50:15] <triallax[m]> I do Ctrl-M to return, though that doesn't work everywhere.
[21:50:16] <poselyqualityles> i bind it to super, but idk i use emacs all that i can

[21:51:17] <guido> yeah on a US keyboard return is bigger

[21:57:02] <guido> if you do it it's great for regular usage but for gaming it has rollover issue sadly, it doesn't register if you press multiple other keys at the same time, so I have to press the farther shift key anyway
[21:57:32] <guido> because the keyboard isn't designed by considering that key as a modifier
