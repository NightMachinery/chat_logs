[00:00:00] <ManofLetters[m]> oh. you are serious
[00:00:27] <EvanR> it's just a very much bigger grid probably
[00:00:42] <ManofLetters[m]> yes, I do take max of velocity and the minimal quant
[00:00:46] <ManofLetters[m]> does it work for you?
[00:00:54] <EvanR> what you say?
[00:01:31] <ManofLetters[m]> never let velocity be 0, take max with the minimal representable velocity
[00:01:43] <ManofLetters[m]> or minimal that ensures movement
[00:01:56] <EvanR> i've got a big velocity
[00:01:58] <ManofLetters[m]> so that depends on your minimal time granule
[00:03:10] <EvanR> I mean, normal, like order of 1
[00:03:55] <ManofLetters[m]> never mind, I didn't want to take you time, but just have a laugh at you :)
[00:04:53] <ManofLetters[m]> but, seriously, I do bound velocity from below so that with the time interval I sample at it gives more than the minimal distance I can represent (on the map grid)
[00:05:13] <ManofLetters[m]> things are either sationary or have at least that minimal velocity
[00:05:46] <ManofLetters[m]> it's not fun when the message says "you were pushed and you fly", but you stay in place
[00:06:35] <EvanR> right in my case stationary or super slow is not an option
[00:07:11] <EvanR> cool, I put in a detector for the original problem, which works, and the "fix" makes it not detect the original problem
[00:07:19] <EvanR> and yet it bounces out anyway xD
[00:08:06] <EvanR> guess I need a debugging mode
[00:11:18] <sm> lol.. it outwits you again
[00:11:49] <sm> yes, seems like debugging mode/monitors/logs are worth the trouble pretty much always

[00:36:20] <EvanR> it's still in there!
[00:36:35] <EvanR> after fixing a detail of the corner interaction
[00:37:12] <EvanR> even though the corner is a micro environment, a particle can technically bounce in and not hit both sides of the corner
[00:37:37] <EvanR> so that's handled

[13:06:02] <ManofLetters[m]> boasting a new release (you need to click the GIF to start animating)

[13:09:44] <ManofLetters[m]> this release is actually for you sm so that Homebrew picks it up (but they haven't yet and I'm too lazy to write a PR) and you can verify if your feedback was adequately addressed and bash the game some more

[23:22:12] <EvanR> I'm overengineering a geometry database
[23:23:24] <f-a> one week ago it was a terminal emulator
[23:23:30] <f-a> what became of it
[23:25:40] <icrbow[m]> what's the hottest k-d tree package right now
[23:25:41] <icrbow[m]> * right now?
[23:30:33] <EvanR> the terminal emulator is still there, in the background
[23:30:43] <EvanR> still reacting to keystrokes xD
[23:48:05] <f-a> icrbow[m]: frankly no idea, what do you need them for? (curious)
