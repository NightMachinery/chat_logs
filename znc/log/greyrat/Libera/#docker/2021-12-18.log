[01:00:25] <bencc1> programmerq: just want to update that I've tested 4 instances of my app outside of containers and it scales linearly
[01:00:45] <bencc1> I still don't know why it doesn't scale linearly inside 4 containers
[01:02:25] *** Quits: mz` (~mz`@user/mz/x-8532539) (Max SendQ exceeded)
[01:11:03] <rawtaz> bencc1: in that test, was the only difference that you on the first case ran four containers with one app in each, and in the other case you ran just ran those applications manually in the same system?
[01:11:12] <rawtaz> so the only difference is the containerization?
[01:11:41] <bencc1> I tried to make it as close as possible
[01:11:55] <bencc1> but it'll take at least a week to replicate the test to be identical
[01:12:04] <rawtaz> so what were the differences?
[01:12:05] <bencc1> but I think it's close enough
[01:12:51] <bencc1> the container has a chrome browser and a local http+webrtc server replaying a webrtc session
[01:13:05] <bencc1> the browser renders the audio+video tracks played by the webrtc server
[01:13:15] <bencc1> so the main functionality of the app is the same
[01:13:23] <rawtaz> ok so all those components in one container?
[01:13:28] <bencc1> yes
[01:13:38] <bencc1> I know it's not a typical usecase for docker
[01:13:51] <bencc1> but still don't understand why it shouldn't scale in a linear way
[01:14:06] <rawtaz> and what differs when you run it outside containers?
[01:14:13] <rawtaz> im terms of setup or what to say
[01:14:34] <bencc1> there are more components inside the container that I didn't use directly on the machine
[01:15:01] <bencc1> like listening to a job queue and capturing a virtual xvfb screen with ffmpeg
[01:15:17] <bencc1> but I think the chrome browser is the main component
[01:15:24] <rawtaz> hmm ok
[01:15:28] <bencc1> yes, this is not scientific and not a direct comparison
[01:15:45] <bencc1> and doesn't give enough to work with
[01:16:06] <rawtaz> i understand its not simple to just pick the stuff out of the container and run it locally, at least i guess so
[01:16:16] <bencc1> true
[01:16:18] <rawtaz> whats the main problem, running multiple xvfb?
[01:16:40] <bencc1> next task is to have comparable app
[01:16:42] *** Joins: mz` (~mz`@user/mz/x-8532539)
[01:16:58] <bencc1> to run multiple xvfb instances and a job queue directly on the machine

[01:18:13] *** Quits: tex (~super@user/dix) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:18:45] <bencc1> this might be similar for testing

[01:20:12] <rawtaz> the apps youre fiddling with, it's not jitsi or related software?
[01:20:22] <bencc1> https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet/tree/master/jibri
[01:20:33] <bencc1> no but it's similar in functionality
[01:20:54] <rawtaz> so i have no idea why it doesnt scale linearly, but what i do think is that its probably not about docker itself, since all docker does is orchestrate a bunch of stuff behind the scenes, such as namespaces, cgroups, etc
[01:21:19] *** Quits: DefiantN (~DefiantN@user/defiantn) (Remote host closed the connection)
[01:21:27] <rawtaz> it would be interesting to know if you could replicate the problem without docker but with similar or equivalent stuff behind the scenes.
[01:21:34] <rawtaz> but i understand if you dont wantt o put more time into that
[01:21:51] <rawtaz> regardles, logically there would be one or more things of those behind the scenes stuff that triggers the issue
[01:24:52] <bencc1> I have no option but to migrate the app outside of containers
[01:25:15] <bencc1> if I'll run into performance issues I'll know that it's not related to containers
[01:25:21] <rawtaz> because of time and effort constraints i presume?
[01:25:22] <rawtaz> yeah
[01:25:23] <bencc1> but if not, I won't know what cause the difference
[01:25:26] <rawtaz> all fair enough :)
[01:25:36] <bencc1> I would love to investigate more
[01:25:40] <bencc1> but don't know what
[01:25:57] *** Joins: DefiantN (~DefiantN@user/defiantn)
[01:26:06] <rawtaz> yeah then might be better to just move on
[01:26:10] <bencc1> webrtc uses hardware accelerated encryption. maybe that is different inside containers
[01:26:21] <rawtaz> you CAN talk with people in #jitsi because they do run stuff containerized
[01:26:27] <bencc1> udp packet in high rate. maybe this?
[01:26:29] <rawtaz> but i have no idea if thatgives anything
[01:26:43] <bencc1> there are too many things to check
[01:26:47] <rawtaz> other than that it's amatter of inspecting resource usage, but thats of course on a quite technical level
[01:27:58] <bencc1> I have prometheus node-exporter running on the host and cadvisor collecting container stats
[01:28:24] <bencc1> the only thing I see is that cpu of the chrome browser doesn't scale linearly
[01:28:52] <bencc1> and at some point the number of processes on the host grow exponentially and cpu goes to 100%

[16:54:47] <jim87> hello! I need to run a script in a container each time it is re-upped from a stopped state (docker stop container; docker start container). Is it possible to do that? AFAIK I can only set an entrypoint, or a command, which executes only the first time, when the container is instantiated
[16:57:35] <rawtaz> the entrypoint will be run every time the container starts - it's the main process that the container is actually all about. so do whatever you need to do in that entryscript
[16:58:37] <jim87> rawtaz: so if in the entrypoint I set a net device down and up in the entrypoint, it will down and up at each start, right? Thanks :)
[16:58:41] *** Joins: j1mu5 (~j1mu5@user/j1mu5)
[16:58:50] <rawtaz> what you were thinking of is probably the fact that a lot of entryscripts are used for initialization, so they check if stuff in the container has been initialized or not and doesnt do it again if thats the case. but the entrypoint still runs every time
[16:59:10] <rawtaz> i guess so yeah, assuming you can do that down and up without issues in the container
[16:59:17] <rawtaz> the commands will run, try it :)

[18:58:32] <daemon> hey all I am building an image that can be used to launch a few applications, the main difference being the CMD [], for instance: CMD [ "/system/bin/init", "--target", "core" ] the only thing different between each application is the --target, it can be irc_inteface system_websocket or core, I wish to run them all within a docker-compose, what would be the most efficient way to change that CMD so I do not have to build the same image multiple times?
[18:59:11] <daemon> I believe you can override the CMD within docker-compose.yml, but yeah wondered whatthe 'best way' was

[21:47:01] <sudomann> why is it that adding ENV and ARG build steps dont bust the cache?
[21:47:36] <sudomann> When I build docker skips right over them and use the cache, but I dont wanna pass --no-cache and rebuild complete from scratch

[22:04:54] <Xeroine> hello, I can do docker run -v /:/data but I can't edit any of the files that I could be able to edit only as root on my host, for example /data/etc/fstab. is there any way I can do this?
[22:06:45] <rawtaz> Xeroine: be more specific. if you dont even explain the symptoms of the problem, noone can help.
[22:07:49] *** Joins: trevors (~trevors@c-65-96-171-157.hsd1.ma.comcast.net)
[22:08:28] <rawtaz> as long as you are root in the container you should be able to modify files all you want
[22:08:41] <artok> mounting root, always sign of a brave soldier
[22:08:50] <rawtaz> yeah :D
[22:09:12] <rawtaz> perhaps they SECURED their system to the extent that they can do this without any risk
[22:11:27] <Xeroine> rawtaz what do you mean?
[22:11:56] <Xeroine> I can't edit the files in the bind mounted directory owned by root, how do I edit the files in the bind mounted directory owned by root?
[22:13:07] <artok> I would guess you're trying to solve some problem that is just created by you, having no real world problem there
[22:13:19] <Xeroine> if I do -v /:/data then in the container /data/etc/fstab is a symlink to /data/etc/.ro112957510/fstab
[22:13:44] <artok> so questions about "why?" you're trying to mount / into data ?
[22:13:55] <Xeroine> ok
[22:14:21] <Xeroine> the image is based on alpine, it has vim installed, it's just containerized vim
[22:14:30] <Xeroine> I want to edit the files on my host with containerized vim
[22:14:45] <Xeroine> I don't understand is this really that strange or what?

[22:15:54] <rawtaz> sounds fine to me as long as you just use the container to run vim :)
[22:15:59] <rawtaz> (and dont expose it in any way)
[22:16:02] <Xeroine> I'm doing this from a container because my host distro doesn't have the latest packages, some shit in vim needs the latest packages of python for example
[22:16:20] <rawtaz> do you know about neovim btw?
[22:16:45] <Xeroine> but I can't edit any of the files like /data/etc/fstab in the container. they're read only
[22:16:51] <Xeroine> well yeah I'm using neovim actually
[22:17:03] <rawtaz> oh ok
[22:17:06] <Xeroine> I just said vim because most people know about it
[22:17:17] <Xeroine> lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            18 Dec 18 18:29 data/etc/fstab -> .ro112957510/fstab
[22:17:23] <Xeroine> this is what it looks like in the container
[22:17:32] <rawtaz> what OS are you on?
[22:17:49] <Xeroine> host is openSUSE leap 15.3 and the image is using alpine:latest
[22:17:52] <rawtaz> and what does that same command show if you run it on the host?
[22:18:06] <Xeroine> -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1311 Nov  7 13:27 /etc/fstab
[22:18:09] <Xeroine> on host

[22:18:30] <rawtaz> is it the same for any other files, that theres a link to some .ro*?
[22:19:05] <Xeroine> I guess I should have mentioned this but I'm running docker in rootless mode 
[22:19:20] <Xeroine> only the files that are owned by root I afaik
[22:19:21] <rawtaz> hm that might be related indeed
[22:20:00] <Xeroine> but I tried starting the docker daemon as root and it didn't make a difference, idk
[22:20:07] <rawtaz> really
[22:21:33] <rawtaz> whats the exact docker command you use?
[22:22:16] <Xeroine> oh right 
[22:23:02] <Xeroine> I ran "systemctl stop --user docker" then as root "systemctl start docker" but if I do something like "docker images" I get "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///run/user/1000/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?"
[22:23:51] <Xeroine> /run/user/1000/docker.sock doesn't exist
[22:24:07] <rawtaz> sounds like your daemon isnt running then, check with e.g. systemctl
[22:24:10] <rawtaz> status
[22:24:18] <Xeroine> status says it's running
[22:24:27] <rawtaz> journalctl?
[22:24:34] <rawtaz> oh wait
[22:24:43] <rawtaz> isnt it that your docker client is looking for the socket in a user specific path?
[22:24:57] <rawtaz> i mean if you run docker as root, wouldnt the socket path be something else than with 1000 in it?
[22:25:20] <Xeroine> oh right
[22:26:06] <rawtaz> obviously something is actively making the file(s) read-only, but i have no idea if it's docker or some opensuse thing
[22:27:32] <Xeroine> oh
[22:27:37] <Xeroine> I hadn't changed back to the default context
[22:27:42] <Xeroine> I was still using the rootless one
[22:27:56] <rawtaz> ok good. and the problem doesnt happen when you run docker as root i take it?
