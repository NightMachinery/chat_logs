[12:01:57] <anchovy> let me get my notes.
[12:01:57] <tabakhase> or am i mixing things with env... not 1000% sure tbh, its way past bedtime ;D

[12:03:17] <anchovy> tabakhase: from my notes: https://paste.debian.net/hidden/919b51ab/
[12:04:07] <tabakhase> that looks mangled up

[12:05:59] <anchovy> I didn't want to bloat them by repeating overly so I abreviated
[12:06:29] <tabakhase> https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#scope "An ARG instruction goes out of scope at the end of the build stage where it was defined. To use an arg in multiple stages, each stage must include the ARG instruction." so i were not mixing things, nice

[12:16:39] <anchovy> tbh that feels like a bug.
[12:20:53] <anchovy> no it doesn't wipe it. it sets it to the value from the previous build stage regardless of the fact that it had a set value in this build stage. ok. a little surprising but potentially useful, I guess?

[17:44:33] <wez> BadKarma: What's your actual question?
[17:56:00] <BadKarma> i have a few. so if i use --network=container:gluetun does this mean i wouldnt be able to connect to it from a different computer locally?
[17:56:23] <BadKarma> I've never readlly written a docker compose so im trying with --network
[17:56:39] *** Joins: Brainium (~brainium@user/brainium)
[17:57:14] <BadKarma> if this is better done through a docker compose i wrote this but didnt debug it yet -- https://pastebin.com/t919uLCp
[17:58:48] <BadKarma> so ideally i would want a znc for my irc that i can connect to locally, but i want to channel the znc through a vpn container (in this case gluetun)
[18:01:14] <BadKarma> i just ran an nmap scan on my pi (docker host) and my znc port is closed, which i guess makes sense

[18:38:07] <rfried> Hi.
[18:38:07] <rfried> I'm wondering if there's a way to use docker and run images on CPU core that were removed from CPU scheduler list using isolcpu (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html?highlight=isolcpu)
[18:38:44] <rfried> My goal is to ensure 100% CPU runtime for container, and to avoid context switching.

[21:25:10] <tabakhase> Oceanwatcher generally yes fine - with note that a) some people like to increase things like systemd TimeoutStop b) your containers itself obvs. need to react to the signals (generally a fine thing unless you build custom contianers/cmd/entrypoints) - and c) "restarting the container" is its own question, containers have a restart_policy for this on them ( +d*) also note that some docker-installations

[21:44:24] <Oceanwatcher> tabakhase My containers are stock containers from the makers. I am not creating any new containers myself - yet :-) So I guess they should all be ok with a normal reboot then. And yes, I am familiar with restarting a container etc. Although I prefer doing that from Portainer. Thank you for answering!
