[01:01:58] <CoolerX> Hi
[01:02:04] <CoolerX> is there a way to ignore the vendor directory?
[01:02:17] <CoolerX> there's a vendor directory from ruby and bundler
[01:02:48] <CoolerX> unfortunately golang picks it up
[01:03:02] <j416> don't put a go project inside a ruby project?
[01:03:10] <j416> subdirectory would work.
[01:03:34] <j416> iirc.
[01:03:34] <CoolerX> the ruby project is on a different branch (gh-pages)
[01:03:46] <j416> then what's the issue?
[01:04:09] <CoolerX> the vendor directory is not added to the repo, it's ignored using .gitignore
[01:04:28] <j416> delete it, problem solved?
[01:04:42] <ikke> GO111MODULE=on
[01:04:59] <j416> ikke: still would read the vendor dir, no?
[01:05:07] <CoolerX> ikke, do I add that to .bashrc?
[01:05:09] <ikke> not if it's set to on afaik
[01:05:27] <j416> go modules support vendoring.
[01:05:54] <CoolerX> I am trying to do this is in a way that will work for all the people working on the repo
[01:06:03] <j416> perhaps it ignores it if there's no vendor/modules.txt. never tried.
[01:06:15] <CoolerX> if I add GO111MODULE=on to .bashrc that would just affect me
[01:06:26] <CoolerX> it wouldn't work for others who are developing on it
[01:06:36] <j416> commit the vendor dir in the other branch?
[01:06:53] <CoolerX> j416, hmm I don't think you are supposed to do that
[01:06:59] <j416> ok
[01:07:06] <j416> then why vendor?
[01:07:07] <CoolerX> it's a large folder
[01:07:14] <CoolerX> j416, I didn't set it
[01:07:21] <CoolerX> it was like that
[01:07:31] <CoolerX> it was like that already when I started working on the repo
[01:11:16] <b0nn> CoolerX: curious, what problems is the vendor directory bringing ?
[01:11:37] <b0nn> I mean, is the go build trying to find stuff in there that's not existing?

[01:26:43] <CoolerX> after I delete the vendor directory everything works as expected
[01:26:56] <llorllale> Hello. I've got a tree structure made up of pure data. Nodes can be of different types. All nodes have common properties but some types have a few extra properties. What would be the "Golang way" of implementing this tree?
[01:27:54] <llorllale> Interfaces doesn't feel like a good fit for this use case (pure data).
[01:28:45] <llorllale> (which also means I'm not keen on adding methods)
[01:29:17] <llorllale> I'm currently leaning towards a single struct model with an `Extra map[string]interface{}` field. Wondering if others have any thoughts on this?

[01:31:25] <CoolerX> llorllale, yeah and alternatively you can embed

[01:43:08] <b0nn> well, no, Node struct{ embed; Data interface{}}
[01:43:27] <b0nn> hrm, that would exclude the extra methods though
[01:44:05] <b0nn> oh, no, the Data will be the type with the extra methods

[01:45:17] <b0nn> So it would be Node{ parent Node; ChildLeft Node; ChildRight Node; Data interface}
[01:46:27] <llorllale> b0nn: something like your second suggestion yes..
[01:47:10] <b0nn> That's how I've written trees thus far
[01:47:40] <b0nn> When generics come along Data will change to Data [any] I think
[01:49:25] <llorllale> Having `Data` be an `interface{}` is nice. The producer can guarantee that `Data` is of a certain type depending on the type of the node.
[01:49:37] <llorllale> Which adds a little more type safety than a map[string]interface{}

[03:59:03] <kodah> Tv_: is it even possible to avoid? i find myself in this situation with protobuf as well.
[03:59:36] <Tv_> kodah: well, simple programs can get by without separating those two
[03:59:45] <kodah> fair enough
[04:00:05] <Tv_> but even then, who says your database access mechanism should get its own struct
[04:00:15] <Tv_> that might just be communally self-inflicted pain
[04:00:25] <kodah> it does make a number of operations quite nice
[04:00:31] <Tv_> case in point: database/sql sure ain't using such a struct

[04:04:41] <kodah> i don't really think it makes sense to demonize orm's over the use of structs.
[04:04:59] <Tv_> no, that part is pretty common, and definitely not just "ORMy"
[04:05:09] <kodah> what part?
[04:05:16] <Tv_> gqlgen and sqlc both go out of their way to let you avoid that translation layer as long as possible, though
[04:05:30] <Tv_> having a struct to represent DB results

[04:06:16] <kodah> what do they incentivize instead?
[04:06:25] <Tv_> so given that e.g. sqlc can perfectly nicely share the db layer struct with business logic for smaller apps, i do think gorm is still extra pain
[04:07:12] <Tv_> they both let you customize the struct enough / use a struct *you* define  to make it ok to reuse business domain objects for database/graphql data as long as possible/as often as possible
[04:07:16] <Tv_> keeps simple things simple
[04:07:35] <Tv_> e.g. your own types for struct fields, not just basic types
[04:08:34] <kodah> i believe gorm lets you do the same thing
[04:09:09] <kodah> i may be misunderstanding though
[04:10:14] <kodah> the situation i run into is when i have some competing configuration for struct tags, hence the "layers" end up getting split out
[04:10:30] <kodah> currently i've got grpc code in one place and a DTO in another.
[04:11:47] <Tv_> kodah: they shouldn't be using the same struct tags tho?
[04:13:34] <kodah> Tv_: they're not, it's more like, it's not appropriate for me to send certain fields over HTTP (json) but it is appropriate for me to store them in the db

[04:15:15] <b0nn> If your DAO objects are in the BL, your BL is polluted and coupled to whatever the DAO is optimised for
[04:15:51] <b0nn> Oh, I see you were using SQL and now want to use a NoSQL cache for reading, best of luck with that we used the SQL structs/types in the wrong places
[04:16:26] <b0nn> the Github Code generation AI announcement has me thinking everything with the clippy voice :)
[04:16:44] <kodah> i think no matter what you do you're basically going to be copying structures a lot
[04:16:56] <kodah> Tv_ is kinda right
[04:17:06] <Tv_> for small things, the work of splitting business logic from other things later is less than the bureaucracy of doing everything on the first day
[04:17:39] <b0nn> When you move data across a boundary you have to make a choice, couple both sides to the abstraction of the data store, or couple both to the bl abstraction
[04:17:57] <Tv_> you speak of things as if code was permanent
[04:18:09] <b0nn> Me, I know the bl is going to change a LOT less than the datastore
[04:18:23] <Tv_> i'd rather take easy-to-edit easy-to-delete code than something with 17 layers of abstractions
[04:18:31] <b0nn> And if the BL changes, then the datastore will have to too
[04:18:48] <b0nn> If the datastore changes I will not care in the BL
[04:19:00] <b0nn> This has been well covered for almost two decades
[04:19:41] <kodah> interesting thoughts
[04:19:49] <Tv_> and OOP has been "well covered" for longer
[04:20:09] <Tv_> doesn't mean everything is always the thing to do every single time

[04:27:48] <b0nn> kodah: it's simple to work out - which piece of code will need the most maintenance
[04:28:19] <b0nn> And which code /should/ change when the other piece does
[04:28:58] <b0nn> With data stores, if you change the type of a field - then the datastore /has/ to change, but should the bl - only if the bl was driving that change
[04:29:23] <Tv_> starting from the assumption that those levels are separated, then they are separate
[04:29:31] <Tv_> circular logic is best because it's circular
[04:33:25] <b0nn> So, a slightly more concrete example: My BL defines a key as 1234, which I store in the db as int32; then my PM decides that, in fact, keys have to support other characters, the BL drives that change, so the datastore needs to react
[04:34:30] <b0nn> But, if the datastore was initially decided to store that as int8, then realised that values could go higher, to int32, then the datastore drives the change, and (crucially) the BL should never care
[04:35:13] <b0nn> So, if you coupled your BL to the datastores implementation, the second scenario would necessitate change in the BL, which could have far ranging effects

[18:44:19] <mickey> hi, im building a plugin for some larger project and i need to query data from a geoip database (mmdb). the catch is i can't use any syscalls so i guess im kinda forced to build the database into my binary file
[18:44:23] *** Joins: sord937 (~sord937@gateway/tor-sasl/sord937)
[18:44:26] <mickey> what would be the best approach to do that?
[18:45:41] <siXy> mickey: What do you mean you can't use any syscalls?
[18:46:28] *** Joins: mrlemke (~mrlemke@208.74.105.200)
[18:46:39] <mickey> the interpreter used in traefik blocks syscalls so i cant read data from the database on the fly
[18:46:48] <edrocks> there is a lib to read geoipdb2
[18:47:00] <edrocks> mickey can you open a file?
[18:47:28] <edrocks> github.com/oschwald/geoip2-golang
[18:48:57] <mickey> sure, im asking about incorporating the database itself into my binary file so i dont need to "open" the file
[18:49:14] <mickey> as that's a syscall that i cant do
[18:49:25] <edrocks> use go embed https://golang.org/pkg/embed/
[18:49:31] <mickey> thanks.
[18:49:45] <edrocks> fyi that geoip database file is pretty large
[18:50:00] <siXy> ^ that. But embedding something that big is going to have downsides, I'd have thought.
[18:50:28] <siXy> Especially for this application - if you need to invoke this per-request this could be infeasible
[18:50:36] <edrocks> ~60mb +
[18:50:53] <edrocks> could be too large to run
[18:51:01] <edrocks> thats for the city db
[18:51:22] <edrocks> there might be one that just gives rough country info iirc it may be smaller
[18:51:26] <edrocks> I was using the more detailed one
[18:51:29] <siXy> yeah the less fine-grained ones are smaller, but even so I'd have serious reservations about this.

[19:02:07] <siXy> even so if this gets run per request, that's going to get pretty silly unless your traffic is extremely low

[22:52:56] <fizzie> When a struct type embeds another, fields and methods of the type being embedded may be /promoted/, meaning accessible as if they were fields/methods of the type doing the embedding.
[22:53:44] <fizzie> (The details are a little more subtle than that w.r.t. pointers, but roughly speaking.)
[22:54:13] <mikoto-chan> and what do you mean by embedding? I'm new to Go ...
[22:55:51] <fizzie> A struct field without a name is called an /embedded field/. There's probably better materials for learning the language than asking random questions in IRC, though. Like the Go Tour... well, except I don't remember if it covers embedding.

[23:08:49] <davidkrauser> has anyone here spent much time with hash/maphash? I'd like to use a specified seed value so that I can have deterministic behavior when marshalling maps between processes (and to disk). It doesn't appear to let you use anything other than a random seed :-/
[23:09:41] <davidkrauser> maybe it's a bad idea to use this package for that
[23:10:39] *** Quits: damasceno (~damasceno@2.155.39.93.dyn.user.ono.com) (Quit: Client closed)
[23:12:14] <Tv_> davidkrauser: you're better off sorting the keys and marshaling in that order
[23:12:52] <Tv_> davidkrauser: maphash ain't gonna make any guarantees about changes over time, either
[23:13:55] <davidkrauser> Tv_: yeah, that's what I was thinking. It just feels like a bad idea to roll my own string -> array index hashing function
[23:14:17] <davidkrauser> but if I want determinism and guarantees about changes over time, that may be the best approach
[23:14:44] <Tv_> davidkrauser: what index hashing?
[23:15:09] <Tv_> davidkrauser: at marshal time, extract keys to slice. sort slice. iterate slice and marshal key and m[key]
[23:15:33] <foobaz> Tv_: ((string) -> (array index)) hashing
[23:15:47] <j416> and if your marshalling format happens to be json, json packages does just that for you
[23:15:54] <j416> fwiw.
[23:15:58] <Tv_> yeah
[23:16:00] <j416> s/packages/package/
[23:16:07] <Tv_> i don't see a reason to change how you store the data, just do the work at marshal time

[23:20:16] <davidkrauser> Tv_: ahh, sorry, I didn't explain clearly. I'm not storing a list of string keys anywhere - I have an array in memory, and when new data comes in, part of that data is used with maphash to find the right location in the array to store it. The input data is tossed.
[23:21:02] <davidkrauser> I could start storing the inputs to maphash, but that's a lot of data that I don't _really_ care about. Just working around how maphash works
[23:21:19] <Tv_> davidkrauser: okay, and then you rely on the array order to be stable across all kinds of things, so hash("foo") once and hash("foo") later just hit the same location
[23:21:30] <davidkrauser> yup :-)
[23:21:33] <Tv_> davidkrauser: and you're sure you can ignore collisions?
[23:21:38] <davidkrauser> yes
[23:21:47] <Tv_> davidkrauser: okay. i'd suggest making your own hash, then
[23:22:07] <Tv_> https://golang.org/pkg/hash/fnv/ or such would be very easy
[23:22:07] <davidkrauser> it's unfortunate, but I think that's the right approach
[23:22:14] <davidkrauser> thank you Tv_
[23:22:27] <Tv_> davidkrauser: maphash is *intentionally* underspecified
[23:23:12] <siXy> If you care about speed a lot, https://github.com/minio/highwayhash should be faster and roughly as secure
[23:24:08] <Tv_> yeah there's things better than fnv, but that's sort of not the tough part of that, they're all interchangeable once you have it going
[23:24:40] <Tv_> fnv is an easy recommendation for first step because it's in the stdlib
[23:24:55] <siXy> *nod* just throwing it out there as this stuff isn't super discoverable unless you already know what you're looking for
[23:25:22] <foobaz> wouldn't it be safer to use a cryptographic hash?

[23:25:51] *** Joins: Jonathan22 (jonathansc@pear.ircnow.org)
[23:26:14] <siXy> you generally don't need a crypto hash for this purpose. You only care about collision resistance, and with modern fast hashes, that's generally considered good enough for most purposes.
[23:26:14] <foobaz> they're slower, but protect you against hash collision attacks
[23:26:44] <Tv_> seeded hashing is more important than crypto-safe hashing, for attacker-induced collisions
[23:29:24] *** Joins: dr0n (~nabromov@94.11.23.235)
[23:30:10] <siXy> foobaz: You're getting confused. These hashes are all called PRFs, and serve a different purpose from a CHF - but that doesn't mean that they're less suitable for this purpose, nor that they're nessecarily any less collision resistant when used in this way.
[23:30:20] *** Quits: s-video (~s-video@2601:196:4b00:e70:ecb7:b07a:13dc:1848) (Quit: Leaving)
[23:33:32] <foobaz> so PRF is sufficient when the seed is kept secret from the attacker, and CHF is necessary when the attacker knows the salt, is that right?
[23:34:29] <Tv_> foobaz: if the attacker can run the same hash function as you (knowing all inputs), they can choose colliding keys, regardless of how crypto-safe it is
[23:34:48] <Tv_> well, i mean
[23:34:51] <Tv_> crypto-safe being a spectrum
[23:34:54] <Tv_> for md5, they can
[23:35:01] <foobaz> wouldn't that be too computationally expensive?
[23:35:42] <Tv_> foobaz: the thing about the collision mechanisms tends to be that you can produce new collisions once an attack exists, the real trade-off is they have to include "binary noise" in the input
[23:35:53] <Tv_> foobaz: and yes properly crypto-safe hash makes that much much more expensive
[23:36:03] <Tv_> foobaz: but the real trick is to not let the attacker know your seed
[23:36:26] <foobaz> how is the seed different than a salt?
[23:36:39] *** Parts: Jonathan22 (jonathansc@pear.ircnow.org) ()
[23:36:46] <foobaz> there's one seed for the entire hashmap, instead of one salt per entry?
[23:37:10] <Tv_> foobaz: i've never heard of per-item salt used for real...?
[23:37:21] <Tv_> i mean, you'd need to store *that* somewhere
[23:37:34] <foobaz> /etc/shadow does right?
[23:37:40] <Sam> I don't have original context, but one salt per-item is how literally every web login thing does it.
[23:37:43] <Sam> And /etc/shadow, yes.
[23:37:44] <davidkrauser> Tv_: that's a pretty common practice for user logins
[23:37:45] <Tv_> foobaz: that's not this kind of hashing though
[23:38:11] <Tv_> nobody stores user account data in a bucket decided by their password hash
[23:38:16] <foobaz> login hashing is the kind i'm familiar with, so i'm trying to draw mental connections between that and this seeded prf hashing you're talking about now
[23:38:35] <Tv_> foobaz: okay so imagine you have [100][]int
[23:39:01] <Tv_> foobaz: that's a simple but reasonably real-world way to implement a hash table (e.g. go map)
[23:39:20] <Tv_> foobaz: where is key k located? in the slice at item hash(k) % 100 of that array
[23:39:32] <siXy> foobaz: It's more that for this application, the only thing that matters is the collision resistance. All the algos mentioned so far are in some sense of the word "cryptographic" hashes, but hashing algorithms like sha-2, blake2b etc provide a lot of extra things (at the cost of significant slowness) that you don't need if all you want is a secure way of creating a map key.
[23:39:53] <Tv_> foobaz: without a seed, if k comes from an attacker, they can cause you to store 999999999 items, that all go in the same slice
[23:40:07] <Tv_> foobaz: and now your hashmap is just a slice, and your program slows down -> that's a denial of service attack
[23:40:22] <foobaz> i'm with you so far
[23:40:35] <Tv_> foobaz: good, because that's the end of the story ;)
[23:40:38] <foobaz> so is the seed hashed after the input data, like a password hash is?
[23:40:54] <foobaz> because if it was hashed before the input data, you could do a preimage attack
[23:41:02] <Tv_> foobaz: generally you use a special keyed-hash algorithm
[23:41:09] <foobaz> ah ok
[23:41:12] <Tv_> foobaz: but a dumb version would be to first hash the seed, then hash the input
[23:41:44] <foobaz> thanks for the explanation
[23:42:15] <Tv_> foobaz: any day. thanks for being a habitual learner, it's always nice to see.

[23:43:58] <Tv_> so to re-summarize, yes a crypto-safe hash makes the attackers job a lot harder too, but 1) for older hashes like md5, not as much so as seeding and 2) you burn cpu unnecessarily, when a keyed hash can get you that protection much cheaper
[23:44:12] <Tv_> and a hash table implementation with a slow hash is just a weird thing ;)
