[01:18:52] <d_bot_> <orbitz> Not sure how it handles values outside 0-127
[01:20:09] <companion_cube> It does
[01:20:24] <companion_cube> char goes up to 255
[01:20:31] <d_bot_> <Bluddy> Yeah it's just identity. Thanks
[01:20:46] <companion_cube> In the other direction there's Char.chr iirc, and an unsafe version of it that doesn't check the range
[01:20:49] <companion_cube> It's mighty useful
[01:21:01] <d_bot_> <Bluddy> The documentation talks about ASCII which is what three me off
[01:22:04] <companion_cube> Heh, char should probably be named `byte` if we had to choose now
[01:22:21] <companion_cube> There's Uchar for real chars

[02:56:12] <quartz> Specifically, is it possible to change the value of a field in a record?
[03:05:06] <companion_cube> If the field is `mutable`, yes. Otherwise you can return a new one with only a field changed
[03:09:01] <olle> Maybe I should learn Scala...
[03:09:18] <olle> It keeps popping up in my searches

[03:15:43] <malc> olle: you don't need to change any values in this case
[03:18:06] <quartz> companion_cube: But in my problem, I need to return a record. So how do I set the fields of the records themselves?
[03:24:18] <quartz> Sorry I'm just so lost, can someone help me understand how to do this problem?
[03:24:43] <quartz> I know what needs to be done, but doing it in OCaml is very difficult.
[03:27:09] <d_bot_> <DickBarnes> I'm having an issue with a program of mine. During long running computations, it's allocating a lot, but during a particular point with a GC pause, it will keep growing the heap until I run out of memory. It seems according to the profiler that once it hits this GC pause, it's spending all of its time in the GC.
[03:27:43] <d_bot_> <DickBarnes> I'm not sure how to reproduce this problem with a small example, and I don't see any particular reason why in some states it does this and in others it doesn't.
[03:28:52] <olle> malc: values? which values?
[03:30:47] <malc> olle: fields not values
[03:32:21] <d_bot_> <DickBarnes> Is it almost certainly a memory leak because of something I did in my program, or is there something deeper here?
[03:34:59] <d_bot_> <NULL> quartz: What algorithm would you write ?

[03:38:36] <quartz> d_bot_: Well, it's basically Kaden's algorithm ( I think I spelt that right), but I'm not sure I need to use that specific algorithm exactly
[03:39:40] <quartz> Basically, iterate through the array, check if the List.hd l is positive. If it is, somehow increment a counter
[03:39:57] <quartz> But that's the problem, you can't store variables and change their values in this language
[03:40:02] <quartz> I mean, without records.
[03:40:06] <quartz> So how am I to do this?
[03:40:16] <d_bot_> <Et7f3> If you need to execute a snippet at shell startup their is a special file that is executed like ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc sometime it is ~/.bash_profile. This is the generic answer that work for all software. opam init seem to offer to modify it.
[03:40:19] <companion_cube> {x with y=z}
[03:40:21] <quartz> Everything is an expression... well OK... what good does this do me
[03:40:31] <companion_cube> That returns a new record
[03:40:49] <quartz> companion_cube: I'm sorry I've no idea what that means
[03:41:13] <d_bot_> <NULL> Do you really need to mutate variables ? If so, use references
[03:41:17] <companion_cube> Look it up, you need to learn a language to use it
[03:41:30] <companion_cube> Record update, in the manual I think
[03:42:29] <quartz> NULL: Well I'm not sure how else I'd do it.
[03:42:54] <quartz> I need to store the longest number of consecutive + or - numbers in a list.... so that counter has to go somewhere right?
[03:43:16] <d_bot_> <NULL> You can using recursion, where an additional argument stores that "variable"
[03:43:52] <d_bot_> <NULL> I don't think it's bad if you write it the imperative way at first, use references for that
