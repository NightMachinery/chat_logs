[00:00:51] <meator> Hello. What is a "driverless" printer in CUPS?
[00:01:04] <Psi-Jack> meator: Basically passing PDF directly to the printer.
[00:01:15] <jimm> you cannot talk about prices at costco, but you can talk about how you'd apply linux to create change
[00:01:27] <Psi-Jack> meator: AKA: Apple AirPlay supported printers.

[00:12:26] <meator> I'm having some minor but annoying issues with my printer. I have used a gutenprint driver, but it "printed" a blank page after every job. This is really bad, because I sometimes print a lot of documents. Ipp doesn't have this issue, but it can't do two sided printing. Is there any chance that the two sided printing can be fixed?

[01:40:41] <matsaman> and using busybox like that for a reason other than rescue or lack of storage (which also is virtually never a thing anymore) is just silly
[01:40:42] <MrElendig> dostoyevsky2: netfilter is basically the kernel space bits
[01:40:47] <matsaman> ohwell
[01:41:16] <msiism> I'm quite okay with Busybox, so far.
[01:41:20] <MrElendig> dostoyevsky2: as well as the name for "the whole"

[01:41:26] <matsaman> at least it's not derivative, or highly proprietary
[01:41:33] <msiism> Yeah, that too.
[01:41:35] <matsaman> that's what usually excludes distros for me

[04:06:14] <SamuelMarks> Are these two equivalent? -   `struct sigaction action{}; action.sa_handler = close_handler; sigemptyset(&action.sa_mask); action.sa_flags = 0; if (sigaction(SIGTERM, &action, nullptr) ) {}`       and      `if (signal(SIGTERM, &close_handler) == SIG_IGN ) {}`?
[04:06:36] <mdogg> In a nutshell, I agree with koollman in that you should be just fine based on your description of how you are using the kernel.  That is my interpenetration based on what I've read.  And the link he provided even spells things out.  All I'm saying is that if you have questions beyond that, then you should seek professional advice.

[14:41:09] <tomreyn> so you run availability (?) tests from route53 somehow (but then route53 is not a monitoring tool, so this is fuzzy at best) against systems at the DC, and the goal there seems to be to verify not just that this kafka system is running and responsive, but also that the network connection to it is up. which you cannot chack if you build a separate route to it. i.e. you should probably be testing through the existing s2s vpn connection.

[16:32:50] <pinemach> Hi, I'm Kubuntu 21.04 and I'm having a confusing issue with playing audio through an external device. I have a display with speakers connected on a desk which I connect different machines to via HDMI when I'm using them. The setup works fine with a Windows computer - even tested with the exact same cable. But although the Kubuntu laptop shows the
[16:32:50] <pinemach> HDMI output and lets me select it, and it shows that audio should be playing, the speakers are silent

[16:33:18] <pinemach> I've searched online and tried some troubleshooting steps but I just find stuff related to choosing the correct audio output or having HDMI out recognized in the first place
[16:33:43] <pinemach> That's not the problem - everything says it's hooked up in Kubuntu, I'm just not getting any actual audio from the speakers
[16:34:02] <selckin> lets get the obvious muted/volume 0 out of the way?

[20:02:15] <CrtxReavr> Not sure how you can claim that (with any credibility). . . if the platform has a basic python interpreter with zip support (they all do) they can run a zipapp.

[21:05:52] <francogrex> by the way, Debian 4.9.168-1 bunsenlabs
[21:05:52] <uwharrie> the accumulated junk should be isolated to your home directory, everything else you should be able to remove via your package manager
[21:05:53] <NiLon> gartt to be fair, do they teach windows in schools
[21:05:54] <kveroneau> My trigger for ultimately moving to UNIX-like systems was two actually.  The first was when I was taking a college course on Windows Server 2000, and began talking to some of my peers, and started to just get interested in the shell, as it was cooler than COMMAND.COM or 4DOS ever was.  I recall downloading a UNIX-like shell for my then Windows 98 machine to start playing around, and that was my first entry into the wonderful world of UNIX-like
[21:05:56] <kveroneau> software.
[21:06:16] <Dagmar> gartt: Underskilled middle-manager types live and die by support contracts.  Because with a support contract, if the people who actually came to work for them on the low-ball salary can't solve the problem, they can then blame the people who they have the support contract with because _they_ didn't solve it
[21:06:24] <gartt> Dagmar: I don't know. In schools? I can see that making plenty of sense in some businesses though. But for schools, I'd think that teaching open source software would be more important
[21:06:34] <Dagmar> In this way they avoid any form of blame falling on their heads, and therefore keep their job

[21:06:57] <Dagmar> gartt: The problem is only more magnified in schools because they don't even pay the teachers competitively with pizza delivery
[21:07:04] <gartt> Dagmar: It's a sound point, but they can pay Red Hat if that's really important :)

[22:09:44] <Gaboradon> sudo dd bs=4M if=.../Downloads/openSUSE.iso of=/dev/sdb status=progress oflag=sync

[22:10:20] <tvm> yeah, i guess the effect will be similar
[22:10:41] <Dagmar> sync at the end is less hassle, but without either, you get to sit and wait an indefinite period of time while the write buffers slowly drain into the flash media

[22:11:17] <uwharrie> theseb: "in the old days" there was one or more big computers with an operator that did a lot of manual maintenance. Sure they'd automate some of it, but it was usually specific to the one or two systems they were maintaining, but they weren't developing the software that was going to run on those systems.

[22:13:21] <Dagmar> Writing to an 8Gb thumbdrive that you got on sale from Amazon (which sports a brisk writing speed of 2Mb/s) can easily mean dd will exit while 6Gb of it are still in memory waiting to be written to the thumbdrive

[22:17:13] <hexnewbie> I think of ‘oflag=direct conv=fsync’ as a fast version of ‘oflag=sync’, as the effect is the same. Not pedantically waiting for the individual writes, but skipping cache just like oflag=sync, and still waiting before telling you it's done.
[22:17:31] <Dagmar> Writing it back out as a CSV (or even using Data::Dumper or Storable, or just using fixed-length records and a flat file)... 8 seconds.

[22:19:52] <hexnewbie> REISUB has several submarine surprises for you. B (unlike O) does not wait for MD RAIDs to finish their outstanding writes, so it can leave RAIDs in need of resync (or worse). E, I are disabled on modern distro for so-called “security reasons”, so processes writing to RAID are not killed, nothing is truly synced, and the “worse” does happen
