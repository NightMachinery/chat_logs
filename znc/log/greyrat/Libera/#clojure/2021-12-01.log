[00:22:48] <ridcully> neirac: if you mean interactive for the developer, have a look at oz which again uses vega (or vega directly if you are on cljs)
[00:23:39] <neirac> ridcully I meant that the user could click on some points on the chart and see some tooltips or values
[00:24:47] <ridcully> vega allows you to define layers/tooltips etc

[01:31:19] <neirac> how do I use map with 3 collections to create a hashmap which has as keys the elements of the collections?
[01:40:03] <aphyr> neirac: What do you want the value for a given key in that map to be?
[01:42:34] <aphyr> Not clear how you'd like the values from different collections to be related--but since you're asking about using map, maybe you're asking for keys which are of the form [first-element-of-coll-1, first-element-of-coll-2, ...]?
[01:42:41] <aphyr> Something like this might work:
[01:42:42] <aphyr> user=> (let [as [:a1 :a2] bs [:b1 :b2] cs [:c1 :c2]] (zipmap (map vector as bs cs) (repeat :some-value?)))
[01:42:45] <aphyr> {[:a1 :b1 :c1] :some-value?, [:a2 :b2 :c2] :some-value?}
[01:44:08] <neirac> aphyr thanks!

[14:39:48] <neirac> is it possible to pass more than one key to a hashmap to extract their values ?
[14:53:10] <ridcully> juxt can do that
[14:53:34] <ridcully> ,((juxt :a :b) {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3})
[14:55:32] <ridcully> if you don't know the keys, i'd use map
[14:56:17] <ridcully> maybe select-keys + vals is worth having a look then too
[14:57:06] <ridcully> ignore that... result might be unordered and missing keys vanish in the result (no nils)
[15:00:02] <neirac> ridcully thanks, I'll juxt
[15:01:16] <neirac> I'm trying to iterate a seq but trying to materialize the nth value I get and error that cannot cast to number  a lazyseq
[15:03:01] <ridcully> have you switch the args of nth?  it's seq first then idx
[15:03:40] <ridcully> otherwise: please share the relevant code via some paste-site

[21:16:30] <rovanion> opqdonut: Exactly, build my frontend and bundle it in my uberjar. 
[21:17:41] <rovanion> The thing is that when I add figwheel as a dep in the main or uberjar profile it ends up in the artifact too.
[21:18:12] <opqdonut> yeah, putting it in the dev profile and using :prep-tasks is how it should work
[21:18:23] <rovanion> The next and more important issue: Why on earth is my compile prep-task run after the compile?
[21:19:08] <rovanion> https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/hPV2nS6fQH/
[21:19:55] <rovanion> Woah, pastebinit on ubuntu defaults to a pastebin that one has to log on to view pastes.
[21:19:59] <rovanion> Oh well.
[21:20:45] <rovanion> http://dpaste.com//8DH7WQBS7
[21:21:14] <rovanion> There's my project.clj for reference.
[21:21:47] <opqdonut> that looks about right but you probably don't need the :uberjar :dependencies
[21:22:12] <opqdonut> is that project description for real, I love it
[21:23:07] <rovanion> That's the first issue, if I remove it figwheel isn't available for when the compile prep task runs.
[21:23:17] <opqdonut> right
[21:23:24] <opqdonut> I wonder if you need to add a with-profile to that
[21:23:40] <rovanion> opqdonut: Yeah, couldn't be bothered to censor anything.
[21:24:19] <opqdonut> you could have a look at how something like the luminus template does this
[21:25:57] <rovanion> Luminus uses shadow-clj nowadays. Otherwise its my goto.
[21:26:16] <opqdonut> I'm sorry I'm not more help, I've had multiple projects where this just works but I can't remember the details
[21:26:22] <rovanion> I was about to say that "with-profile" is probably going to have the exact same result. But I'll be damned it worked!
[21:26:37] <opqdonut> yeah that allows you to jump "out" of the uberjar profile
[21:26:57] <rovanion> opqdonut: You are excellent help, no matter the actual outcome!
[21:26:59] <opqdonut> now that I think about it perhaps all my projects have used raw cljsbuild for the uberjar
[21:28:04] <rovanion> That's what I remember doing last project, but I wanted to try going the figwheel-main route this time around to spare another build tool.
[21:28:26] <opqdonut> mmh
[21:28:39] <opqdonut> why not shadow btw? (I haven't moved on to shadow land either)
[21:29:35] <rovanion> The recommendation I read on discourse was "unless you want to depend on a lot of node modules the added complexity is not worth it".
[21:30:11] <opqdonut> right, the people I talk to say it's new standard, no reason to start a new project with anything else
[21:30:22] <opqdonut> should find out for myself I guess

[21:39:17] <rovanion> Now the latter more important issue: Why on earth does the prep-task run after the uberjar is archived?

[21:55:09] <opqdonut> that sounds weird
[21:59:02] <opqdonut> https://github.com/CSCfi/rems/blob/master/project.clj here's a project.clj from a previous project of mine that works
[21:59:18] <opqdonut> has pretty much the same :uberjar :prep-tasks setup, but with cljsbuild instead of figwheel-main
[22:00:04] <neirac> how do I pass a function as a function parameter?
[22:00:18] <opqdonut> just pass it
[22:00:47] *** Joins: lunik1 (~lunik1@37.205.14.203)
[22:00:52] <opqdonut> e.g. (map inc [1 2 3])
[22:00:57] <opqdonut> inc is a function passed as a parameter

[22:15:18] <golanv> Some of the stats folks at the office have decided to dabble in Python to produce graphs/charts for the web. Would trying to use Clojure for the web bits (ring, compojure, hiccup, jetty) with clj-python be a bad idea? Or would a Python framework be more sane?
[22:18:58] <egli> golanv: depends how confortable you are with either language. I personally prefer the Clojure web stack by far.
[22:20:10] *** Joins: theruran_ (uid11305@id-11305.hampstead.irccloud.com)
[22:20:31] <shiranaihito_> golanv Python is pretty good for web-apps too, and Ring etc were modelled after Python's "WSGI"
[22:23:23] <golanv> I'm probably equally bad at both languages, but so enjoy Clojure more. I was mainly concerned using Clojure would cause some problems when attempting to make use of python functions written in house by the statistics department. 
[22:28:31] <golanv> s/so/do/
[22:30:01] <logiz> could have python running a seperate service just for creating assets? might overcomplicate it though
[22:33:23] <golanv> Hmm...I guess I just need to do some testing....worst case, switching out to a python framework shouldn't be horrible. 
[22:36:36] <neirac> is there a way to execute my function using lein run?
[22:36:49] <technomancy> neirac: use the -m argument
[22:40:51] <neirac> technomancy thank you very much!
