[00:34:32] <linuxr> hi there, I try to access a local page using http://my.page, but firefox seems to change this to https://my.page which fails because it's a http server and not https
[00:34:39] <linuxr> how the fuck can I access the http page?
[00:36:49] <Peng> Literally a .page domain?
[00:40:25] <linuxr> no, just a normal domain name, which I use locally using a .hosts file entry
[00:41:32] <linuxr> what the fuck...using "network.stricttransportsecurity.preloadlist=false" it works
[00:41:39] <linuxr> what the actual fuck?
[00:42:02] <linuxr> where the hell does that list come from?
[00:43:33] <linuxr> browser now preventing me from locally using some domain name, really?
[00:46:51] <Peng> You should probably not turn off important security features.
[00:46:54] <Peng> I'm surprised you even can.
[00:52:09] <moonmoon> don't override real tlds with hosts entries
[00:52:19] <moonmoon> use .local or something
[00:52:32] <moonmoon> you'll be in a lot of pain for other reasons going your current route
[00:52:49] <Peng> .local has its own issues, being for mDNS. :D
[00:53:15] <moonmoon> linuxr: the list would come from the real owner of the domain saying they wanted their site to be HTTPS-only and alerting the browser vendors that fact
[00:58:46] <omegatron> linuxr: this shouldn't happen .. i'm working at various in-house web servers from time to time, all of them listed in my hosts file and none of them uses https and my firefox (89.x) doesn't change http to https
[00:59:44] <moonmoon> literally just said why it happens
[01:00:37] <moonmoon> overriding real domains with your own internal hosts entries is a case of "play stupid games, win stupid prizes" -- and in this case the stupid prize is the rest of the world listening to the real domain owner (the other stupid prize is misconfigured things lacking said hosts entries streaming your internal data to a site you don't control)

[01:01:41] <omegatron> ah, ok .. I didn't saw the "Literally a .page domain"  line   my bad =D
[01:02:01] <omegatron> (didn't know .page is a valid tld) ..
[01:02:18] <moonmoon> don't think it is, but they said "just a normal domain name, which I use locally"
[01:02:24] <moonmoon> making me think it's a .com or .org or something

[01:02:47] <moonmoon> (that they don't actually own)
[01:03:22] <Peng> It is! And the entire TLD is on the HSTS preload list. :)
[01:07:57] *** Joins: drogas (~drogas@jump2.jet.uk)
[01:09:28] <linuxr> so...where can I see this HSTS preload list?
[01:09:34] <moonmoon> it's a big list
[01:09:39] <linuxr> yes..where is it?
[01:09:41] <moonmoon> and gets bigger by the day
[01:09:53] <linuxr> what a great idea, performance-wise
[01:12:25] <moonmoon> https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/tip/security/manager/ssl/nsSTSPreloadList.inc
[01:12:38] <moonmoon> it's a security feature, not a performance feature
[01:12:44] <moonmoon> and shouldn't be disabled
[01:12:44] <Peng> (The Chromium and Mozilla lists diverge a bit.)
[01:13:11] <linuxr> of course it should be disabled
[01:13:23] <Peng> There's also a website, https://hstspreload.org/
[01:13:24] <linuxr> when I request http, I want http
[01:13:27] <linuxr> and not something else
[01:13:51] <Peng> linuxr: I don't recommend rocking SSL Strip attakcs like it's 2009
[01:14:33] <moonmoon> requesting http over the internet is a terrible idea and should be discouraged whenever possible, the HSTS header lets sites tell your browser "only use HTTPS for me" which is a good start but subject to attacks where an MITM strips that header. Preloading solves that initial load issue and always forces HTTPS
[01:15:04] <linuxr> wow, 2.3 mb list...please mozilla and google, give me even more bloat
[01:15:19] <linuxr> I really wonder what these guys are thinking
[01:15:40] <moonmoon> that the extra security is worth it
[01:15:48] <moonmoon> is what they are thinking
[01:16:05] <moonmoon> (which is an opinion I share)
[01:16:10] <linuxr> if I want http only I can enable this in firefox, end of story
[01:16:30] <linuxr> but yeah no, lets add all domains in the world to some list
[01:16:38] <linuxr> *https only I mean
[01:17:00] <moonmoon> the list is only comprised of domains where the owner has specifically requested it be included on said list
[01:17:39] <moonmoon> so the fact it's biting your local stuff means you aren't the real owner of the domain you're trying to use locally
[01:17:44] <linuxr> yeah, just one more action to take away freedom from the user and transfer it to big tech
[01:17:49] <moonmoon> which means you're doing something extremely dumb
[01:18:09] <moonmoon> and should stop doing the dumb thing rather than whining about security features working as intended
[01:18:11] <linuxr> why shouldn't I use whatever I want, locally
[01:18:48] <Peng> Because you'll stub your toe, apparently
[01:19:01] <moonmoon> from above: "the other stupid prize is misconfigured things lacking said hosts entries streaming your internal data to a site you don't control"
[01:19:17] <linuxr> someone really needs to make a firefox fork with all this user hostile bloat removed
[01:19:26] <linuxr> back to the roots
[01:20:22] <moonmoon> the only legitimate use of masking a real domain with a hosts entry is to blackhole it
[01:20:25] <linuxr> its already bad enough that google does such things with chrome..but mozilla? you're supposed to be the good guys
[01:20:59] <BaronVladimirHar> LibreWolf will be the future for millions of Firefox users who are fed up with this garbage.
[01:21:12] <moonmoon> what's its bus factor?
[01:21:30] <BaronVladimirHar> Even if Mozilla only causes 1 million users to leave for LibreWolf, it will damage them financially.
[01:21:32] <Peng> BaronVladimirHar: Are you upset about HSTS or changing the subject to some other thing?
[01:21:33] <linuxr> librewolf?
[01:21:36] <moonmoon> (and while firefox has plenty of bload, the HSTS preload list isn't one of those things)
[01:21:45] <BaronVladimirHar> That's 2% of the number they lost to other browsers in the last 3 years.
[01:21:53] <moonmoon> LibreWolf is far more concerned about removing things like the pocket integration
[01:21:57] <BaronVladimirHar> So it is conceivable that LibreWolf could gain a million users.
[01:22:10] <moonmoon> rather than disabling actual security features that are widely-agreed upon web standards
[01:22:17] <BaronVladimirHar> moonmoon: Right, it removes spam and bloat and spyware and adware.
[01:22:32] <BaronVladimirHar> Stuff that doesn't add value for the user and just gets in the way and destroys value.
[01:22:43] <Peng> BaronVladimirHar: So... not HSTS
[01:23:08] <BaronVladimirHar> I don't know what it changes about HSTS, if anything.e
[01:23:13] <BaronVladimirHar> s/I don't know what it changes about HSTS, if anything.e/I don't know what it changes about HSTS, if anything./
[01:23:21] <moonmoon> I doubt it changes anything about HSTS
[01:23:23] <linuxr> what is this hsts list good for anyway...can't a webserver just signal hsts via HTTP header?
[01:23:32] <BaronVladimirHar> I have three browsers on my computer that get any real use now. Brave, GNOME Web, and LibreWolf.
[01:23:41] <Peng> linuxr: That was answered earlier
[01:23:42] <moonmoon> linuxr: yes, but that's subject to downgrade attacks by MITMs
[01:23:59] <moonmoon> you need an out-of-band channel to mitigate the issue of the initial connection to the site being compromised
[01:24:09] <BaronVladimirHar> And LibreWolf is fast too!
[01:24:19] <BaronVladimirHar> They often bump the Flatpak the same day Mozilla does.
[01:24:33] <linuxr> well, the browser warns when it's an unsecure connection anyways so I really don't see the problem
[01:24:39] <BaronVladimirHar> 94.0.2 is a pointless release.
[01:24:57] <BaronVladimirHar> It was pushed out purely to solve a problem that the Windows Store adds to an MSIX version of Firefox.
[01:25:11] <moonmoon> HSTS turns the warn into a block
[01:25:11] <BaronVladimirHar> So why bump it on GNU/Linux and make people re-download? This is a disaster.
[01:25:27] <moonmoon> (although there are ways around the block, they're harder than just clicking through the warning page)
[01:25:36] <linuxr> in the end it just takes away freedom from the users and adds bloat
[01:25:57] <linuxr> mozilla should be concerned about protecting users rights and freedom
[01:26:00] <moonmoon> take it to the w3c, maybe you can convince them ;)
[01:26:17] <moonmoon> HSTS and the preload list are both web standards, rather than "this is a thing firefox is doing"
[01:27:48] <moonmoon> it does occasionally make things annoying, but in your particular case your footgun is your setup, not HSTS
[01:28:19] <linuxr> it was no footgun until google, mozilla and whoever decided to turn it into one
[01:28:25] <moonmoon> where HSTS falls flat is trying to access a site protected by it to fix a TLS certificate issue with it (perhaps cert expired and you need to use the web portal to update said cert)
[01:28:49] <peterhil_> t4nk_freenode: I never got to make the spaghetti. Maybe tomorrow... :-)
[01:28:53] <moonmoon> in that case it's still operating as designed, but the design is preventing the person able to fix it from fixing it
[01:29:05] <moonmoon> so every browser provides an escape hatch for those instances
[01:29:40] <moonmoon> the escape hatch is intentionally difficult to find/use because otherwise people will just click through it like they click through every other warning without reading it
[01:30:04] <linuxr> all this "security" stuff is actually just used by big tech as an excuse to take away freedom from users
[01:30:09] <moonmoon> yawn
[01:30:28] <moonmoon> sorry, I ran out of tinfoil for my haberdashery a while ago
[01:30:50] <linuxr> lol...people let themselves get fooled so easily
[01:31:39] <linuxr> so what's this wolf thing?
[01:32:06] <linuxr> librewolf
[01:32:11] <moonmoon> it's a fork of firefox
[01:32:17] <moonmoon> you should be able to easily search it online

[17:22:10] <daidoji> Hello.  I have a very confusing problem that I'm not sure how to begin to troubleshoot.  I'm on Windows, FF 94.0.2 (64-bit) and when I go to the site http://bactra.org/weblog I get a sleeping dreamhost robot and "site not found".  This site has a self signed TLS cert.  However, when I go to that site in chrome I can get there.  Tried blasting my cache and history for that site but it didn't 
[17:22:10] <daidoji> seem to work.  Anything else I can try or a set of steps to troubleshoot?
[17:24:08] <daidoji> I tried turning tracking protection to standard also and reloading the page but that didn't seem to work either
[17:24:34] <daidoji> Its almost like its trying to get to an TLS page on Dreamhost that doesn't exist and not dropping down to the http site (which is what it looks like chrome does)
[17:25:50] <daidoji> oh I also turned off the https requirement in the top bar for that site by adding an exception, but it still seems to upgrade to the https site that isn't there.

[19:22:20] <podeni> Hi everyone. I'm trying to write JS code to do the following: 1. open a tab in Firefox with "w = window.open(url)"; 2. use the returned reference to the opened window, "w", to perform certain actions on the opened page, like I would if I were coding something in GreaseMonkey (from within the original page that opened the second one). But upon trying to access w.document Firefox throws up: 
[19:22:20] <podeni> 'Permission denied to access property "document" on cross-origin object'. What FF settings would I need to change to allow this?
