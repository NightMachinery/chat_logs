[00:21:23] <ttkp> Hello!  I'm a software engineer wanting to add prolog support to my cli calculator, and wondering what the pros and cons are regarding swi-prolog and gprolog
[00:21:38] *** Joins: Bi[m] (~bimatrixo@2001:470:69fc:105::109a)
[00:22:23] <ttkp> there are 9x more swi-prolog-using projects on github than gprolog-using, but why is swi so much more popular?
[00:23:56] <ttkp> do the two projects accept a sufficiently similar dialect of prolog as to make them effectively interchangeable?  I could perhaps make my calculator look for either gprolog or swi on the local system and use whatever it finds
[00:24:40] <ttkp> sorry for the newb questions, I learned prolog in the 1980s and haven't used it much since .. I keep thinking about getting back into it, but kept putting it off
[00:26:35] <ttkp> looking at the git activity for gprolog vs swi-prolog, swi-prolog is updated literally orders of magnitude more, both per unit time and overall, which could be good or bad.  I don't like churn for the sake of churn, but there's also such a thing as useful development.
[00:30:56] *** Quits: wacki (~wacki@87.123.138.240) (Quit: Leaving.)
[00:38:56] <RLa> ttkp, swi-prolog is much more popular but both of them support so-called iso prolog
[00:39:11] <RLa> sort of
[00:39:30] <RLa> well, the common part is usable in both
[00:39:46] <RLa> your cli calculator?
[00:45:58] <pbmagi> Both main authors are academics, but the SWI author is now full-time on SWI. GProlog can be compiled. SWI-Prolog is probably best dialect for web-stuff. If portability is your main concern, best to use Logtalk, which'll run on SWI, GNU, and more.
[00:47:04] <pbmagi> SWI's popularity is probably a combination of good community out-reach, nice docs, and web libraries.
[01:01:42] *** Joins: sektor|3 (~kvirc@94.155.193.66)
[01:04:34] <ttkp> RLa, pbmagi - thanks, that helps, and I'll take a look at Logtalk

[01:05:46] <ttkp> RLa - my cli calculator is essentially a stack-oriented perl REPL which munges input slightly to make it more useful as a calculator .. it was literally the second perl program I wrote, 23 years ago, and it's been growing organically since
[01:06:03] <ttkp> it's one of those humble tools that I use almost every day
[01:07:21] <ttkp> I've been meaning to rewrite it, partially to make it more maintainable but also to support different "modes", so that the same stack can be operated upon with different languages (perl, python, prolog, C, D, SQL)
[01:08:26] <ttkp> hrm, I haven't updated this for a while, but it's more or less what I use on my desktop:
[01:08:27] <ttkp> http://ciar.org/ttk/codecloset/calc
[01:08:45] <ttkp> the code itself is horrible, horrible, horrible .. hence the desire to rewrite
[01:12:21] <ttkp> the calc script itself is just the core functionality, with useful functions stuffed into .calc.code or in external modules like https://metacpan.org/pod/Algorithm::CurveFit::Simple

[01:17:52] <aindilis> ttkp: I have some experience with Prolog/Perl integrationo
[01:20:04] <ttkp> aindilis - oho?  any advice?  I was just looking at some relevant CPAN modules
[01:20:31] <aindilis> well I use two means, Yaswi and Pengine.
[01:20:39] <aindilis> Both specific to SWIPL
[01:21:10] <aindilis> Yaswi is high latency, high bandwidth.  Pengine is low latency, low bandwidth.
[01:21:24] <aindilis> Going to write a common channel that figures out which to use
[01:21:32] <aindilis> the maintainer of yaswi is here
[01:21:44] <aindilis> sivoais
[01:22:02] * ttkp finds https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=section(%27packages/pengines.html%27)
[01:22:15] <ttkp> and was just looking at the Yaswi module in CPAN
[01:22:18] <aindilis> so I have a lot of perl code for interacting with Prolog
[01:22:31] <aindilis> my main system is in Perl and my new work is mostly Prolog
[01:24:07] <ttkp> thanks :-) Yaswi in particular looks useful .. which would imply using swi, not gprolog, but I'm okay with that
[01:25:50] <aindilis> well I use SWIPL, and love it, but I don't want to insist that other's use i
[01:25:51] <aindilis> t
[01:26:21] <aindilis> btw, I'm also interesting in theorem provers and to a lesser extent computer algebra
[01:27:15] <aindilis> link to your code?
[01:27:31] <ttkp> http://ciar.org/ttk/codecloset/calc
[01:27:38] <aindilis> ty!
[01:27:45] <ttkp> quite welcome .. but there's no prolog there yet
[01:28:19] <ttkp> The Plan[tm] is to rewrite it to be more maintainable and support different "modes" so that its stack can be operated upon by any of a number of languages
[01:28:30] <aindilis> oh cool
[01:28:33] <aindilis> I also like NLP
[01:28:36] <aindilis> ( https://www.gecode.org/ <- this might be interesting somewhat, i discovered a few days ago)
[01:28:49] <aindilis> which editor do you use?
[01:28:57] <ttkp> jove, which is a lightweight emacs
[01:29:10] <ttkp> calc uses gnu-readline
[01:29:11] <aindilis> I have a thing called FreeKBS2-Ring which is a stack for textual contents and operations thereon - in Emacs
[01:29:13] <aindilis> ah
[01:29:20] <aindilis> *stack of stacks
[01:29:29] <aindilis> reminds me
[01:29:30] <aindilis> of yours
[01:30:25] * ttkp is a fan of stacks, it drives me nuts when a REPL doesn't maintain a stack
[01:30:37] <aindilis> https://github.com/aindilis/freekbs2/blob/master/frdcsa/emacs/freekbs2-ring.el
[01:30:56] <ttkp> cool :-) thank you!
[01:31:01] <aindilis> :)
[01:31:06] <aindilis> does jove do elisp?
[01:32:17] <ttkp> no, only an inferior lisp dialect
[01:32:26] <aindilis> inferior sounds so emacsy
[01:32:28] <ttkp> which, frankly, I never use, beyond configuration
[01:32:32] <ttkp> hahaha
[01:32:32] <aindilis> alright, please feel free to ping me with any support questions in the days to come
[01:32:42] <ttkp> thanks :-) I will!
[01:32:50] <ttkp> glad to have found this channel
[01:32:59] <aindilis> I have to bbiab, but I'll check out your code in a little bit.  Yeah, this channel is good, if a tad silent
[01:33:46] * ttkp apologizes in advance for the calc code .. it was *literally* the second perl program I wrote, after hello_world, and it's been growing organically ever since
[01:34:01] <ttkp> 23 years ago
[01:36:30] <aindilis> cool!!  My systems are similar "Baby Perl"
