[00:13:20] <michigan> Hi! I run this forum app on my main www.myapp.com, with two secondary apps photos.myapp.com and shop.myapp.com. Each are separate Rails apps. Should I keep it like that, or turn them all into a single app?
[00:13:54] <michigan> From what I understand the pros are: It would eliminate unnecessary code repetition and make upgrading and maintenance much easier. Having a single user database sounds nice too.
[00:14:14] <michigan> On the flipside, the app would be complicated by (please correct me if I'm wrong) namespaces, routes, tenants and possibly even Rails Engines. I'd also have to restructure everything in Git.
[00:16:14] <weaksauce> that's a tough question to answer

[00:18:06] <michigan> Cool. That means it at least isn't a dumb question :-)
[00:18:26] <weaksauce> like anything there are tradeoffs 
[00:18:49] <weaksauce> are they all bespoke projects?
[00:18:52] <weaksauce> how big?
[00:21:05] *** Quits: _ht (~quassel@231-169-21-31.ftth.glasoperator.nl) (Remote host closed the connection)
[00:22:19] <michigan> Nope, they're all personal.
[00:22:21] <weaksauce> how are the apps architected right now?
[00:22:34] <michigan> The main app currently clocks in at 110 commits. The other ones around 50.

[00:22:47] <michigan> I can show you the log, hold up.
[00:23:55] <michigan> Actually, any advice to improve this log would also be sincerely appreciated.

[00:29:21] <michigan> The main app: https://gist.github.com/basicfeatures/c165104a9c60d91444d713245884ff60
[00:29:47] <michigan> The two other apps share the same commits up until "Images: Add ImageProcessing gem".
[00:29:56] <michigan> Not sure if all this is related to my original question, but still.
[00:31:28] <weaksauce> if they are in the same domain it makes sense to have them all in one app typically... 
[00:31:32] <weaksauce> depends
[00:32:15] <weaksauce> depending on the shopping requirements it can be separate or if it's simple then in one 
[00:32:33] <weaksauce> really tough to say with any certainty 
[00:33:47] <mooff> probably a good question for #rubyonrails 
[00:33:51] <michigan> Good point.

[00:34:40] <michigan> mooff: #rubyonrails is dead though :(
[00:35:18] <mooff> i just joined it. eek :(
[00:35:23] <michigan> Hopefully my question should be more of a general Ruby webapp question, but I can see how it's not.
[00:35:23] <weaksauce> not to drive people away from irc but michigan you can ask in the ruby discord too 
[00:35:36] <weaksauce> irc is still good
[00:35:41] <weaksauce> weekends are slow though
[00:35:49] <michigan> mooff: I remember it used to be something though! Back when Radar et. al. used to be around :(
[00:36:02] <weaksauce> yeah it was pretty prolific a while back
[00:36:10] <michigan> weaksauce: Will do so!
[00:36:16] <michigan> Yeah :-)
[00:36:37] <weaksauce> turns out the freenode thing and generally rails questions are not all that common any more since it's a stable thing
[00:36:44] <michigan> Then, as you'd have it, they all went and got married and had children :lol:
[00:37:09] <mooff> which answer do you want to your question, btw? :P
[00:37:41] <weaksauce> have you tried the flip the coin trick?
[00:38:49] <mooff> i haven't Rails'd since about 2016, but working with engines, esp when they lived in different repos, was always a pain

[09:16:37] <michigan> apotheon: Welcome back lol
[09:16:49] <ox1eef> my approach would be to use something like sinatra or roda to mount other rack apps (eg rails, etc).
[09:24:08] <michigan> ox1eef: I'll keep you guys posted üëç
[09:24:42] <michigan> By the way, I'm trying to check if a JSON response contains `en` or `fr`, but struggle to convert it to a hash (TypeError: no implicit conversion of Hash into String). Can anybody tell what's wrong? https://gist.github.com/basicfeatures/77612d12ed0c4ba5b3e9619dadb4aa5f

[09:31:27] <ox1eef> michigan: it looks like you already have a Hash from detect_language.
[09:32:00] <ox1eef> new_hash = json_response["languages"] should work.
[09:45:50] <michigan> Oh I see, my bad. Great, thanks!
[09:46:24] <ox1eef> welcome
[09:49:16] <michigan> Would you happen to know how I could check if that hash has a key present? I tried `if new_hash.key?("en")` but got `NoMethodError: undefined method `key?' for [{"en"=>0.9999953354389854}]:Array`
[09:54:05] <ox1eef> michigan: what response are you expecting? it is kind of odd to have an array of languages, with each element being a hash. why is there not one hash with each language as a key?
[09:57:01] <ox1eef> if that's simply the data you're working with, then languages = json_response['languages']; languages.each { |language, float| if language == "en; ...; elsif language == "de"; ....; end }
[09:58:36] <michigan> It's the response I get from this language analysis API: `{"languages"=>[{"en"=>0.9999970265109813}]}` means there's a 99% probability a sentence is in English. I'm trying to check if the key `en` is present that's all.
[09:59:42] <michigan> Nice! Cheers mate!
[09:59:50] <ox1eef> languages = json_response['languages']; languages.any? { |language| language.key?("en") } }
[10:00:01] <ox1eef> sorry first paste didnt work, the above should work.
[10:01:19] <michigan> Much obliged ‚ù§Ô∏è
[10:01:30] <ox1eef> if you want to find the response for "en": languages = json_response['languages']; english = languages.find { |language| language.key?("en") } 
[10:02:29] <michigan> Great, might come in handy some day
[10:03:18] <ox1eef> yeah, probably require some edits, but hopefully you get the idea
[10:03:51] <michigan> Yep!
[10:08:55] <ox1eef> the structure of the response makes it more awkward than it seems it should be. a single hash rather than arrays wrapping one would be easier to work with,
[10:15:38] <michigan> I'm not fully familiar with the API yet, but I do believe there are cases where it's not sure, so it'll suggest several different languages with their respective probability scores...
[10:20:35] <michigan> Works like a charm! https://gist.github.com/basicfeatures/77612d12ed0c4ba5b3e9619dadb4aa5f (looks gorgeous too)

[19:25:46] <RedNifre> Is that likely? Maybe I should ask the gem maintainer first...

[21:19:41] <havenwood> RedNifre: Use Rubies that came out after M1.
[21:41:22] <RedNifre> What's the proper way to use ruby on macs anyway? I just switched to macs and heard that the one that comes with the system is old.

[21:44:27] <havenwood> RedNifre: You can `brew install ruby` for an up-to-date version but most folk working on more than one app use a version switcher like chruby, rbenv, RVM, or asdf so they can have whatever versions of Ruby the app needs.
[21:44:41] <havenwood> RedNifre: Any of those switchers is fine.
