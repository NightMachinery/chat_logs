[01:00:36] <ehuelsmann[m]> choroba: thanks. 
[01:00:41] <LeoNerd> This is sounding like something github-based
[01:00:45] <LeoNerd> Clue may be in the name ;)
[01:00:45] <ehuelsmann[m]> I can't explain it as fast as choroba
[01:00:52] <ehuelsmann[m]> :-) it is.
[01:01:13] <ehuelsmann[m]> GitHub allows you to run jobs ("actions") on a large number of triggers.
[01:01:25] <ehuelsmann[m]> it's more a GitHub integration framework, but can be used as CI.
[01:01:29] <choroba> I remembered there was a blog post about it, so googled for Perl Github Actions and quickly found the link
[01:01:32] <LeoNerd> Hrm
[01:01:39] <LeoNerd> see I just wanted to edit some .pm files and run the test again, repeatedly
[01:01:45] <LeoNerd> like I would by ssh'ing into some random machine
[01:01:48] <ehuelsmann[m]> people are using GitHub Actions to trigger builds on (un)related repositories.
[01:01:55] <choroba> It runs on every commit
[01:01:59] <LeoNerd> Hrm
[01:02:02] <choroba> if configured to do so
[01:02:04] <LeoNerd> so I have to commit stuff
[01:02:24] <choroba> you can always fixup your commits later
[01:02:24] <ehuelsmann[m]> well, you have to get it into GItHub, yes.
[01:02:32] <LeoNerd> Each edit, I mean
[01:02:38] <LeoNerd> and all I can see afterwards is what it printed
[01:02:41] <LeoNerd> It feels rather hands-off
[01:02:48] <ehuelsmann[m]> if I had a Windows box to share, I'd do that.
[01:03:59] <ehuelsmann[m]> or you could create an azure free tier windows vm.
[01:04:04] <choroba> When I need a MSWin box to develop on, I ask my wife to lend me her laptop
[01:04:14] <ehuelsmann[m]> no idea what the size of that would be and whether you can actually develop on it.
[01:04:30] <LeoNerd> I don't want to create a VM
[01:05:01] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. I guess I misunderstood the question. what do you want to achieve again?
[01:05:30] <LeoNerd> I want to open an editor and type some lines of code and then run "perl thing.pl" and see the output and then go back and edit the file a bit more and then run it and see some more and continue until I fix the bug
[01:05:43] <LeoNerd> I don't want to have to think about "learning an entire new operating system I have never touched"
[01:06:11] <ehuelsmann[m]> ah. right. that's a big difference.
[01:06:23] <LeoNerd> I'm just running out of ideas to make UV work on Windows
[01:06:33] <LeoNerd> I'm sure there's a ~5 line 20 second edit that can be made if only someone knew what it is
[01:06:36] <LeoNerd> but apparently nobody does

[01:07:45] <LeoNerd> It shouldn't need anyone familiar with UV. I can do that bit
[01:07:59] <LeoNerd> The overall problem is that I don't even know if the thing I'm trying to make work is *supposed* to work
[01:08:08] <LeoNerd> If it isn't ever supposed to work I can just "skip" that test and all will be fine
[01:09:35] <ehuelsmann[m]> I dumped all my windows systems. I would have loved to help.
[01:09:54] <LeoNerd> Imean in a way i'm sortof stuck in the middle of a catch-22.
[01:10:02] <LeoNerd> It kindof feels like nobody cares about Windows any more
[01:10:15] <LeoNerd> but then if that's the case, why are we bothering with libuv at all?
[01:10:33] <ehuelsmann[m]> hmm.
[01:10:46] <Adura> Something about EV's author.

[02:14:28] <LeoNerd> Which one?
[02:14:28] <genio> LeoNerd: The sockets and handles on Windows problem was one I tried to battle as well. on Windows a handle and socket are structures HANDLE and SOCKET, unlike a file descriptor on unix/linux. Getting those passed to the functions properly was causing issues and that bit of code might be removable as I can no longer remember if it was one of the many attempts at fixing it. It might be the wrong implementation
[02:14:29] <ehuelsmann[m]> it's not a problem per se, but a lot of work since I don't have that environment right now.

[02:51:46] <ehuelsmann[m]> right. we need to printf()-litter the code and run it on Windows.
[02:52:06] <LeoNerd> ehuelsmann[m]: yup, which leads me back to the "i want to edit some code and then run it and see" loop above

[02:54:59] <LeoNerd> It seems that I have to get hold of the "SOCKET" thing relating to it
[02:56:07] *** Joins: Martchus_ (~martchus@2a01:c22:7a6c:5100:d250:99ff:fe49:3cce)
[02:56:23] <ehuelsmann[m]> LeoNerd: right. I was searching the Perl code base to find out what `socketpair()` in your test code returns.
[02:56:36] *** Joins: fb61 (~Frank@ip-109-43-115-230.web.vodafone.de)
[02:56:39] <ehuelsmann[m]> but I'm unable to establish that at the moment.

[02:58:07] <ehuelsmann[m]> yes. I found that and that's what my remark "it seems that the _get_osfhandle() call is still required" was based on.
[02:58:21] <LeoNerd> Yuh
[02:58:29] <leont> On older perls (pre 5.18) that was different, the behavior depended on USE_SOCKETS_AS_HANDLES

[02:59:18] <LeoNerd> It may be that the UV.xs code is all correct and it's entirely my unit test that's wrong
[02:59:25] <LeoNerd> in the way it hacks up that socketpair()

[05:16:48] <Grinnz> those are the main offenders, but other packaging systems may need similar if they install only the parts of perl the system needs by default

[17:04:36] <Altreus> Should be trivial to start a branch like "v2" and switch the repo to that
[17:04:49] <Altreus> It probably is tbh
[17:05:01] <haarg> it is, but why would you want to?
[17:05:06] <simcop2387> yea it'd just need to be actually set
[17:05:18] <Altreus> because neither "master" nor "main" is a meaningful branch name
[17:05:23] <simcop2387> i don't know how to control the meta with MB either.
[17:05:25] <haarg> it isn't meant to be meaningful
[17:05:30] <haarg> that's kind of the point
[17:05:39] <Altreus> I don't follow
[17:05:46] <xenu> i don't see how "the main branch" isn't meaningful
[17:06:01] <Altreus> because of the definite article
[17:06:10] *** Joins: tg (~tg@rockylinux/infra/tg)
[17:06:26] <Altreus> the existence of a v2 in that repo implies that there are now two main branches

[17:06:41] <haarg> there aren't
[17:06:43] <xenu> i guess v2 was supposed to be temporary
[17:07:09] <Altreus> my point is that every other branch describes what it is for so why not pick a name for master that describes what it is for

[17:07:18] <Altreus> v1, production, stable, something like that
[17:07:47] <simcop2387> or development if you never have a "stable" branch
[17:07:51] <Altreus> right
[17:08:04] <Altreus> in fact the lack of existence of a branch called master is, itself, meaningful
[17:08:12] <Altreus> It says, this is in development. There is no stable branch
[17:08:23] <Altreus> the main branch changes its meaning over time so why have it at all
[17:08:51] <Altreus> does it mean "This will be released" or does it mean "This has been released"?
[17:09:13] <Altreus> everyone uses master differently and some people think it's racist for some fucking reason so let's just stop having that concept in the first place

[17:19:43] <haarg> git has two concepts of a default branch. one is the branch created when you create a repo. if you were going to get rid of that, you either have to prompt the user for a name, or force the user to create a branch before anything will work sensibly. that's just more work for pretty much no benefit.

[17:32:31] <genio> ehuelsmann[m]: No, I hadn't gone back and read since he first posted it last night. crap
[17:33:10] <ehuelsmann[m]> yea. windows and sockets can indeed best be described as crap.
[17:33:15] <ehuelsmann[m]> still.
[17:34:31] <xenu> i'll probably bypass CRT's read() and write() completely
[17:34:40] <xenu> or at least for sockets
[17:34:42] <xenu> i'm not sure yet
[17:35:53] <xenu> we already implement our own read() for console, so that will just take it a little bit further
[17:36:44] <ehuelsmann[m]> I sure hope you get this nailed. would be extremely nice to have the sockets behave similarly on Unix and Windows, despite the OS differences.
[17:38:28] <xenu> there are a few other problems with sockets in perl on windows
[17:38:35] <xenu> 1. dup() corrupts them
[17:38:38] <xenu> 2. they aren't thread safe
[17:39:07] <xenu> 3. on msvc 2015+ builds, close() doesn't work properly
[17:39:15] *** Joins: habamax_ (~habamax@31.41.231.220)
[17:39:36] <ehuelsmann[m]> ok. I wouldn't ever have noticed (2)-- not using threads on Perl.
[17:40:28] <xenu> i'll try to fix all the issues, as long as it's actually doable
[17:40:33] <xenu> i have some doubts about 1.

[19:18:18] <gordonfish> Good question
[19:18:36] <ology> What was "turbo" for computers anyway?
[19:18:50] <rindolf> gordonfish: hey Master Fish! sup?
[19:19:28] <gordonfish> (Always found it amusing that (on most systems) engaging turbo reduced performance :wtf-dom-torreto-face:
[19:19:29] <gordonfish> )
[19:19:30] <Grinnz> ology: at one point you could limit the clock speed of the CPU because some programs actually didn't work when CPUs started to get too fast - turbo removed that limit
[19:19:46] <ology> More oxygen to the carburetor? :)
[19:19:52] <ehuelsmann[m]> mst: plx doesn't document it wants to run on top of perlbrew. But I can't find "plenv" in its sources. Does it expect a functioning perlbrew installation?
[19:19:54] <ology> Ah
[19:19:57] <gordonfish> ology: *less
[19:20:48] *** vrurg_ is now known as vrurg
[19:20:54] <gordonfish> The general idea of the "turbo" function was to slow down the CPU so programs written for slower CPUs and that which were sensitive to CPU speed, would function correction.
[19:21:02] <gordonfish> Especially useful for games that would run at light speed on faster processors.
[19:21:42] * ology never played video games. Shocking
[19:21:43] <Grinnz> similar to the problem of old games (or recent games, *cough bethesda*) which tie simulation to framerate and thus computers which are too fast make things go weird
[19:21:56] <gordonfish> { didn't work } Grinnz: Most would actually run, just way too fast.
[19:23:02] <ehuelsmann[m]> the good old PC/8086 days. 4Mhz was too fast for the game...
[19:23:11] <revhippie> Blazing speed!

[19:24:29] <gordonfish> rindolf: Hello.
[19:24:46] <revhippie> gordonfish: That must be what this "Plaid" button is for...
[19:24:52] <ehuelsmann[m]> Just imagine what an 8Mhz 80286 would do to that game, if you didn't limit the cpu speed (since the game wasn't actually checking how much real time elapsed; since at its original speed, it would simply saturate all cycles and checking elapsed time was just... spending cycles which were not available)

[21:05:24] <nuclightq> of course I use callbacks after init
[21:05:45] <nuclightq> well, it'not $_ there actually, compared var really has value
